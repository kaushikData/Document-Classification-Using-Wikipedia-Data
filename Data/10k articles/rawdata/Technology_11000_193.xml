'''Allomothering''', "'''alloparental'''", "'''infant handling'''", or '''non-maternal infant care''', is performed by any group member other than the mother or genetic father and thus is distinguished from parental care. It is a widespread phenomenon among mammals and birds.  Depending on age-sex composition of groups alloparents, helpers or "handlers" can be non-reproductive males in [[Polyandry#Animal polyandry|polyandrous]] systems, reproductive or non-reproductive adult females, young or older juveniles or older siblings interested in abetting their own [[genetic material]] via their siblings (Theory of [[Inclusive fitness|Inclusive Fitness]]).  Allomothering comprises a wide variety of behaviours including: carrying, provisioning, grooming, touching, nursing (allonursing) and protecting the infants from predators or conspecifics.

Allomothering is particularly common among the Primate order. [[Vervet Monkey|Vervets]], [[Capuchin monkey|cebus monkeys]], [[squirrel monkey]]s, and [[macaque]]s are all known for allomothering performed by females not closely related to the pair. These alloparents help by carrying the infant, providing food, and guarding the infant from [[predator]]s. Cebus monkey females have been known to regularly nurse (allonurse) infants who are not their own (cf. [[wet nurse]]). In these species allonursing is performed by related and unrelated females. Moreover, about 10% of nursing bouts are attributed to allonursing. Allomothering can also be performed by non-reproductive helpers like in the [[Callitrichinae|callitrichids]] ([[marmoset]]s and [[tamarin]]s). In the Callitrichids, allomothering care goes beyond many other species and infants are spontaneously provisioned by all group members without a prior begging calls on part of the infants. These species practice facultative cooperative breeding, where a single dominant female reproduces and other group members (fathers, other males and non-reproductive juveniles) provide the majority of care to the infants.

A number of adaptive functions have been proposed to account for the widespread incidences of allomaternal care in mammalian and avian species. [[Jane Lancaster]] noted the reproductive benefits for primates as [[r/K selection theory|k-strategists]] in learning to be better mothers, or acquiring mothering skills. Her learning-to-mother hypothesis postulates that primate females with no children of their own participate in allomothering, and evidence from studies by [[Sarah Hrdy]] and [[Lynn Fairbanks]] shows that females without offspring "tried to allomother more frequently than what you'd expected based on their proportion of the group's population, while parous females tried it much less than expected from their population in the group." The hypothesis is supported by evidence of the success of allomothering as a learning technique. "Lynn Fairbanks studied vervets and found that first-time mothers with high alloparenting experience raised 100% of their first offspring to maturity, but mothers with low experience had less than a 50% survival rate of their first infant." Other hypothesis include "alliance-formation", where subordinate allomothers endeavour to form social alliances with dominant mothers by interacting with their infants. Under kin-selection theory, related allomothers may improve their inclusive fitness if the allomothering behaviour contributes to the survival or faster reproductive rate of the mother. Finally, allomaternal care has been suggested to be a by-product of maternal care. However, this hypothesis would not explain the high levels of care seen by juvenile, subadult or unrelated adult males in many [primate] species.

An infant's birthmother, in a climate of allomothering, may gain time relieved from parental duties, allowing her to forage more efficiently or reproduce more quickly (i.e. reduce her inter-birth interval). In some cases it may also improve the chances for her infant to be adopted by another resident female should she die. Infants may also benefit through a faster maturation rate or earlier weaning time. They may also gain valuable social skills by interacting with alloparents. Finally, infants may form social-alliances of their own and improve their chances of having future dispersal partners.

Allomothering care may not always be beneficial. In some cases "aunting-to-death" has been reported where females withhold an infant from their mother until the point where the infant dies. In other cases infants may be kidnapped and receive life-threatening bites or hits from an alloparent. Mothers are often restrictive of allomothers attempts to touch or handle their infants in species where the risk of injury or death is high (e.g. resident-nepotistic [[Cercopithecine]] species like Japanese macaques).

[[File:RF preamplifier for TV and FM VUBCB40N inner view.jpg|thumb| ''Antenna amplifier'' for [[broadcasting service]] (here: ''TV broadcasting'' and ''FM souns broadcasting''.]]

In [[electronics]], an '''antenna amplifier''' (also: '''aerial eamplifier''' ('''booster'''), Am '''antennefier''') is a device that amplifies an [[antenna (radio)|antenna]] [[Signal (electronics)|signal]], usually into an output with the same [[Electrical impedance|impedance]] as the input impedance. Typically 75 ohm for [[coaxial cable]] and 300 ohm for [[twin-lead|twin-lead cable]].

An ''antenna amplifier'' boosts a [[radio signal]] considerably for devices that receive [[radio wave]]s. Many devices have an [[RF amplifier]] stage in their circuitry, that amplifies the antenna signal, these include, but are not limited to; radios, televisions, mobile phones and Wi-Fi and Bluetooth devices. Amplifiers amplify everything, both the desired signal present at the antenna, and the noise. Typical signal noises include: ambient [[background noise]] (electric brush noise from electric motors, high voltage sources from, for example a gasoline [[engine ignition]], or large dispersed currents in the vicinity of the desired reception [[electric fence]]). To add, consideration must be taken for the noise generated by the amplifier itself and all other electrical noise which may be generated by the device that is to receive a signal, for example a lot of consideration has to go into mobile phone circuitry design to eliminate as much noise from its own circuitry in order to not disturb the desired transmission signals from its own antenna(ae).

An [[indoor antenna]] may include an amplifier circuit, whereby powered reception of the signal can help with capturing as much of an FM, UHF/VHF signal, for amplifying a radio or television signal. Its draw backs are that any noise is usually amplified as well, and a common result from this is amplification of ghost images (for analog signals), and any other perturberances that may be existing locally or even extra terrestrially like the Cosmic microwave background radiation for devices that work in that frequency range.

The key to a "good" level of input at your [[Receiver (radio)|receiver]] with the minimum amount noise includes many design considerations in an electrical amplifier. In theory it is best if you amplify a "clean" signal to a higher level than a "noisy" signal to a higher level, and many circuits include filters to remove all but the desired reception signal. Some consideration has to be taken for cable loss and the signal frequencies desired for example higher frequency ([[VHF]] or higher: 2.4&amp;nbsp;GHz Wi-Fi/third generation mobile phone.) the more the loss that the cable has, and the more susceptible the transmission cable is to noise degradation. Starting with a signal from the antenna which is then directed through a [[coaxial cable]], the amount of loss depends upon a number of factors, cable type and cable length are the two most important. Cable is rated in db loss per length of cable at a specified frequency, for example [[RG-6 cable]] is the cable most used for Television reception.
* [[Belden (electronics company)|Belden]] 1829AC Coax - Series 6 has a loss of 4&amp;nbsp;db/100 feet at 500&amp;nbsp;MHz (TV Channel 18)- 495.250
Channel 32 which is 580&amp;nbsp;MHz, Channel 52 is 700&amp;nbsp;MHz a 5&amp;nbsp;db loss At TV channel 2, the cable would have a loss of 1.4&amp;nbsp;db. So at channel 18 you would lose more than 1/2 the power in 100' of cable between the antenna and the TV.

'''Arthur Holly Compton''' (September 10, 1892&amp;nbsp;– March 15, 1962) was an American physicist who won the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] in 1927 for his 1923 discovery of the [[Compton effect]], which demonstrated the [[particle physics|particle]] nature of [[electromagnetic radiation]]. It was a sensational discovery at the time: the wave nature of light had been well-demonstrated, but the idea that light had both wave and particle properties was not easily accepted. He is also known for his leadership of the [[Manhattan Project]]'s [[Metallurgical Laboratory]], and served as Chancellor of [[Washington University in St. Louis]] from 1945 to 1953.

In 1919, Compton was awarded one of the first two [[United States National Research Council|National Research Council]] Fellowships that allowed students to study abroad. He chose to go to [[Cambridge University]]'s [[Cavendish Laboratory]] in England, where he studied the [[scattering]] and [[Absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorption]] of [[gamma rays]]. Further research along these lines led to the discovery of the Compton effect. He used X-rays to investigate [[ferromagnetism]], concluding that it was a result of the alignment of [[electron spin]]s, and studied [[cosmic ray]]s, discovering that they were made up principally of positively charged particles.

During [[World War II]], Compton was a key figure in the Manhattan Project that developed the first [[nuclear weapon]]s. His reports were important in launching the project. In 1942, he became head of the Metallurgical Laboratory, with responsibility for producing [[nuclear reactor]]s to convert [[uranium]] into plutonium, finding ways to separate the plutonium from the uranium and to design an atomic bomb. Compton oversaw [[Enrico Fermi]]'s creation of [[Chicago Pile-1]], the first nuclear reactor, which went critical on December 2, 1942. The Metallurgical Laboratory was also responsible for the design and operation of the [[X-10 Graphite Reactor]] at [[Oak Ridge, Tennessee]]. Plutonium began being produced in the [[Hanford Site]] reactors in 1945.

After the war, Compton became Chancellor of Washington University in St. Louis. During his tenure, the university formally desegregated its undergraduate divisions, named its first female full professor, and enrolled a record number of students after wartime veterans returned to the United States.

== Early life ==
[[File:Compton Heisenberg 1929 Chicago.jpg|thumb|left|Arthur Compton and [[Werner Heisenberg]] in 1929 in Chicago]]
Arthur Compton was born on September 10, 1892, in [[Wooster, Ohio]], the son of Elias and Otelia Catherine (née Augspurger) Compton,{{sfn|Hockey|2007|p=244}} who was named American Mother of the Year in 1939.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americanmothers.org/past-national-mothers-of-the-year |title=Past National Mothers of the Year |accessdate=July 23, 2013 |publisher=American Mothers, Inc. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110323130748/http://www.americanmothers.org/past-national-mothers-of-the-year |archivedate=March 23, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  They were an academic family. Elias was dean of the University of Wooster (later [[The College of Wooster]]), which Arthur also attended. Arthur's eldest brother, [[Karl Compton|Karl]], who also attended Wooster, earned a [[PhD]] in physics from [[Princeton University]] in 1912, and was president of [[MIT]] from 1930 to 1948. His second brother [[Wilson Martindale Compton|Wilson]] likewise attended Wooster, earned his PhD in economics from Princeton in 1916 and was president of the State College of Washington, later [[Washington State University]] from 1944 to 1951.{{sfn|Compton|1967|p=425}} All three brothers were members of the [[Alpha Tau Omega]] fraternity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://depaul.digication.com/atohistory/The_1920_s |accessdate=August 10, 2013 |publisher=Alpha Tau Fraternity |title=The Official History of the Beta Beta Chapter of the Alpha Tau Omega Fraternity }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Compton was initially interested in astronomy, and took a photograph of [[Halley's Comet]] in 1910.{{sfn|Compton|1967|pp=11–12}} Around 1913, he described an experiment where an examination of the motion of water in a circular tube demonstrated the rotation of the earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Science|volume=37|issue=960|doi=10.1126/science.37.960.803 |pmid=17838837|pages=803–06|title=A Laboratory Method of Demonstrating the Earth's Rotation|date=May 23, 1913|last1=Compton|first1=A. H.|bibcode = 1913Sci....37..803C }}&lt;/ref&gt; That year, he graduated from Wooster with a [[Bachelor of Science]] degree and entered Princeton, where he received his [[Master of Arts]] degree in 1914.&lt;ref name="Nobel" /&gt; Compton then studied for his PhD in physics under the supervision of Hereward L. Cooke, writing his dissertation on "The intensity of X-ray reflection, and the distribution of the electrons in atoms".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://library.nd.edu/chemistry/resources/genealogy/physics/documents/ComptonAH.pdf |accessdate=July 24, 2013 |title=Arthur Holly Compton (1892–1962) |publisher=[[University of Notre Dame]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Arthur Compton earned his PhD in 1916, he, Karl and Wilson became the first group of three brothers to earn PhDs from Princeton. Later, they would become the first such trio to simultaneously head American colleges.{{sfn|Compton|1967|p=425}} Their sister Mary married a missionary, C. Herbert Rice, who became the principal of [[Forman Christian College]] in [[Lahore]].{{sfn|Allison|1965|p=82}} In June 1916, Compton married Betty Charity McCloskey, a Wooster classmate and fellow graduate.{{sfn|Allison|1965|p=82}} They had two sons, Arthur Alan and John Joseph Compton.{{sfn|Allison|1965|p=94}}

Compton spent a year as a physics instructor at the [[University of Minnesota]] in 1916–17,{{sfn|Allison|1965|p=83}} then two years as a research engineer with the [[Westinghouse Electric (1886)|Westinghouse Lamp Company]] in [[Pittsburgh]], where he worked on the development of the [[sodium-vapor lamp]]. During [[World War I]] he developed aircraft instrumentation for the [[Signal Corps (United States Army)|Signal Corps]].{{sfn|Allison|1965|p=82}}

In 1919, Compton was awarded one of the first two [[United States National Research Council|National Research Council]] Fellowships that allowed students to study abroad. He chose to go to [[Cambridge University]]'s [[Cavendish Laboratory]] in England. Working with [[George Paget Thomson]], the son of [[J. J. Thomson]], Compton studied the [[scattering]] and [[Absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorption]] of [[gamma rays]]. He observed that the scattered rays were more easily absorbed than the original source.{{sfn|Allison|1965|p=83}}{{sfn|Compton|1967|p=27}} Compton was greatly impressed by the Cavendish scientists, especially [[Ernest Rutherford]], [[Charles Galton Darwin]] and [[Arthur Eddington]], and he ultimately named his second son after J. J. Thomson.{{sfn|Compton|1967|p=27}}

For a time Compton was a deacon at a Baptist church. "Science can have no quarrel", he said, "with a religion which postulates a God to whom men are as His children."&lt;ref name="Time"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,755635-5,00.html |newspaper=[[Time Magazine]] |title=Science: Cosmic Clearance|date=January 13, 1936}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Compton effect ===
Returning to the United States, Compton was appointed Wayman Crow Professor of Physics, and Head of the Department of Physics at [[Washington University in St. Louis]] in 1920.&lt;ref name="Nobel" /&gt; In 1922, he found that [[X-ray]] [[Quantum|quanta]] scattered by free electrons had longer [[wavelength]]s and, in accordance with [[Planck constant|Planck's relation]], less [[energy]] than the incoming X-rays, the surplus energy having been transferred to the electrons. This discovery, known as the "[[Compton effect]]" or "Compton scattering", demonstrated the [[particle physics|particle]] concept of [[electromagnetic radiation]].{{sfn|Allison|1965|pp=84–86}}&lt;ref name="Compton effect"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Compton, Arthur H.|title=A Quantum Theory of the Scattering of X-Rays by Light Elements |journal=[[Physical Review]] |volume=21|issue=5|pages=483–502|date=May 1923|doi=10.1103/PhysRev.21.483|bibcode = 1923PhRv...21..483C | url = http://prola.aps.org/abstract/PR/v21/i5/p483_1 |accessdate=September 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1923, Compton published a paper in the ''[[Physical Review]]'' that explained the X-ray shift by attributing particle-like momentum to [[photon]]s, something Einstein had invoked for his 1905 Nobel Prize–winning explanation of the [[photo-electric effect]]. First postulated by [[Max Planck]] in 1900, these were conceptualized as elements of light "quantized" by containing a specific amount of energy depending only on the frequency of the light.{{sfn|Gamow|1966|pp=17–23}} In his paper, Compton derived the mathematical relationship between the shift in wavelength and the scattering angle of the X-rays by assuming that each scattered X-ray photon interacted with only one electron.  His paper concludes by reporting on experiments that verified his derived relation:
:&lt;math&gt;\lambda' - \lambda = \frac{h}{m_e c}(1-\cos{\theta}),&lt;/math&gt;
where
:&lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; is the initial wavelength,
:&lt;math&gt;\lambda'&lt;/math&gt; is the wavelength after scattering,
:&lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Planck constant]],
:&lt;math&gt;m_e&lt;/math&gt; is the [[electron rest mass]],
:&lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; is the [[speed of light]], and
:&lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; is the scattering angle.&lt;ref name="Compton effect" /&gt;

The quantity {{frac|''h''|''m&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;c''}} is known as the [[Compton wavelength]] of the electron; it is equal to {{val|2.43|e=-12|u=m}}. The wavelength shift {{nowrap|''λ′'' − ''λ''}} lies between zero (for {{nowrap|''θ'' {{=}} 0°}}) and twice the Compton wavelength of the electron (for {{nowrap|''θ'' {{=}} 180°}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/lengths.html#compton_wavelength |accessdate=August 18, 2013 |title=The Compton wavelength of the electron |publisher=[[University of California Riverside]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19961110050634/http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/lengths.html#compton_wavelength |archive-date=1996-11-10 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He found that some X-rays experienced no wavelength shift despite being scattered through large angles; in each of these cases the photon failed to eject an electron. Thus the magnitude of the shift is related not to the Compton wavelength of the electron, but to the Compton wavelength of the entire atom, which can be upwards of 10,000 times smaller.&lt;ref name="Compton effect" /&gt;

"When I presented my results at a meeting of the [[American Physical Society]] in 1923," Compton later recalled, "it initiated the most hotly contested scientific controversy that I have ever known."{{sfn|Compton|1967|p=36}} The wave nature of light had been well demonstrated, and the idea that it could have a dual nature was not easily accepted. It was particularly telling that diffraction in a crystal lattice could only be explained with reference to its wave nature. It earned Compton the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] in 1927. Compton and Alfred W. Simon developed the method for observing at the same instant individual scattered X-ray photons and the [[recoil]] [[electron]]s. In Germany, [[Walther Bothe]] and [[Hans Geiger]] independently developed a similar method.{{sfn|Allison|1965|pp=84–86}}

=== X-rays ===
[[File:Alvarez and Compton.jpeg|thumb|Compton at the University of Chicago in 1933 with graduate student [[Luis Walter Alvarez|Luis Alvarez]] next to his cosmic ray telescope.]]
In 1923, Compton moved to the [[University of Chicago]] as Professor of Physics,&lt;ref name="Nobel"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1927/compton-bio.html  |title=Arthur H. Compton – Biography |publisher=Nobel Foundation |accessdate=March 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; a position he would occupy for the next 22 years.{{sfn|Allison|1965|pp=84–86}} In 1925, he demonstrated that the scattering of 130,000-volt X-rays from the first sixteen elements in the [[periodic table]] (hydrogen through sulfur) were [[Polarization (waves)|polarized]], a result predicted by J. J. Thomson. [[William Duane (physicist)|William Duane]] from [[Harvard University]] spearheaded an effort to prove that Compton's interpretation of the Compton effect was wrong. Duane carried out a series of experiments to disprove Compton, but instead found evidence that Compton was correct. In 1924, Duane conceded that this was the case.{{sfn|Allison|1965|pp=84–86}}

Compton investigated the effect of X-rays on the sodium and chlorine nuclei in [[salt]]. He used X-rays to investigate [[ferromagnetism]], concluding that it was a result of the alignment of [[electron spin]]s.{{sfn|Allison|1965|pp=87–88}} In 1926, he became a consultant for the Lamp Department at [[General Electric]]. In 1934, he returned to England as Eastman visiting professor at [[Oxford University]]. While there General Electric asked him to report on activities at [[General Electric Company plc]]'s research laboratory at [[Wembley]]. Compton was intrigued by the possibilities of the research there into [[fluorescent lamp]]s. His report prompted a research program in America that developed it.{{sfn|Allison|1965|pp=88–89}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.americanrhodes.org/info.html |title=Eastman Professorship |publisher=The Association of American Rhodes Scholars |accessdate=July 26, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Compton's first book, ''X-Rays and Electrons'', was published in 1926. In it he showed how to calculate the densities of diffracting materials from their X-ray diffraction patterns.{{sfn|Allison|1965|pp=87–88}}  He revised his book with the help of [[Samuel K. Allison]] to produce ''X-Rays in Theory and Experiment'' (1935). This work remained a standard reference for the next three decades.{{sfn|Allison|1965|p=90}}

=== Cosmic rays ===
By the early 1930s, Compton had become interested in [[cosmic ray]]s. At the time, their existence was known but their origin and nature remained speculative. Their presence could be detected using a spherical "bomb" containing compressed air or argon gas and measuring its electrical conductivity. Trips to Europe, India, Mexico, Peru and Australia gave Compton the opportunity to measure cosmic rays at different altitudes and latitudes. Along with other groups who made observations around the globe, they found that cosmic rays were 15 per cent more intense at the poles than at the equator. Compton attributed this to the effect of cosmic rays being made up principally of charged particles, rather than photons as [[Robert Millikan]] had suggested, with the latitude effect being due to [[Earth's magnetic field]].{{sfn|Compton|1967|pp=157–163}}

== Manhattan Project ==
[[File:Compton ID badge.JPG|thumb|left|upright|Arthur Compton's ID badge from the Hanford Site. For security reasons, he used a fake name.]]
In April 1941, [[Vannevar Bush]], head of the wartime [[National Defense Research Committee]] (NDRC), created a special committee headed by Compton to report on the NDRC uranium program. Compton's report, which was submitted in May 1941, foresaw the prospects of developing [[radiological weapon]]s, [[nuclear propulsion]] for ships, and [[nuclear weapons]] using [[uranium-235]] or the recently discovered [[plutonium]].{{sfn|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|pp=36–38}} In October he wrote another report on the practicality of an atomic bomb. For this report, he worked with [[Enrico Fermi]] on calculations of the [[critical mass]] of uranium-235, conservatively estimating it to be between {{convert|20|kg}} and {{convert|2|t}}. He also discussed the prospects for [[uranium enrichment]] with [[Harold Urey]], spoke with [[Eugene Wigner]] about how plutonium might be produced in a [[nuclear reactor]], and with [[Robert Serber]] about how the plutonium produced in a reactor might be separated from uranium. His report, submitted in November, stated that a bomb was feasible, although he was more conservative about its destructive power than [[Mark Oliphant]] and his British colleagues.{{sfn|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|pp=46–49}}

The final draft of Compton's November report made no mention of using plutonium, but after discussing the latest research with [[Ernest Lawrence]], Compton became convinced that a plutonium bomb was also feasible. In December, Compton was placed in charge of the plutonium project.{{sfn|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|pp=50–51}} He hoped to achieve a controlled [[chain reaction]] by January 1943, and to have a bomb by January 1945. To tackle the problem, he had the different research groups working on plutonium and nuclear reactor design at [[Columbia University]],  Princeton University and the [[University of California, Berkeley]], concentrated together as the [[Metallurgical Laboratory]] in Chicago. Its objectives were to produce reactors to convert uranium to plutonium, to find ways to chemically separate the plutonium from the uranium, and to design and build an [[atomic bomb]].{{sfn|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|pp=54–55}}

In June 1942, the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers]] assumed control of the nuclear weapons program and Compton's Metallurgical Laboratory became part of the [[Manhattan Project]].{{sfn|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|pp=74–75}} That month, Compton gave [[Robert Oppenheimer]] responsibility for bomb design.{{sfn|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|p=103}} It fell to Compton to decide which of the different types of reactor designs that the Metallurgical Laboratory scientists had devised should be pursued, even though a successful reactor had not yet been built.{{sfn|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|pp=180–181}}

When labor disputes delayed construction of the Metallurgical Laboratory's new home in the [[Red Gate Woods]], Compton decided to build [[Chicago Pile-1]], the first nuclear reactor, under the stands at [[Stagg Field]].{{sfn|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|pp=108–109}} Under Fermi's direction, it went critical on December 2, 1942.{{sfn|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|p=174}} Compton arranged for [[Mallinckrodt]] to undertake the purification of uranium ore,{{sfn|Allison|1965|p=92}} and with [[DuPont]] to build the plutonium semi-works at [[Oak Ridge, Tennessee]].{{sfn|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|pp=190–191}}

A major crisis for the plutonium program occurred in July 1943, when [[Emilio Segrè]]'s group confirmed that plutonium created in the [[X-10 Graphite Reactor]] at Oak Ridge contained high levels of [[plutonium-240]]. Its [[spontaneous fission]] ruled out the use of plutonium in a [[gun-type nuclear weapon]]. Oppenheimer's [[Los Alamos Laboratory]] met the challenge by designing and building an [[implosion-type nuclear weapon]].{{sfn|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|pp=46–49}}

[[File:Arthur H. Compton House (7373049818).jpg|thumb|right|Compton's house in Chicago, now a national landmark]]
Compton was at the [[Hanford site]] in September 1944 to watch the first reactor being brought online. The first batch of uranium slugs was fed into Reactor B at Hanford in November 1944, and shipments of plutonium to Los Alamos began in February 1945. {{sfn|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|pp=304–310}} Throughout the war, Compton would remain a prominent scientific adviser and administrator. In 1945, he served, along with Lawrence, Oppenheimer, and Fermi, on the Scientific Panel that recommended military use of the atomic bomb against Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nuclearfiles.org/menu/key-issues/nuclear-weapons/history/pre-cold-war/interim-committee/interim-committee-recommendations_1945-06-16.htm |title=Recommendations on the Immediate Use of Nuclear Weapons |publisher=nuclearfiles.org |accessdate=July 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was awarded the [[Medal for Merit]] for his services to the Manhattan Project.{{sfn|Allison|1965|p=93}}

== Return to Washington University ==
After the war ended, Compton resigned his chair as Charles H. Swift Distinguished Service Professor of Physics at the University of Chicago and returned to Washington University in St. Louis, where  he was inaugurated as the university's ninth Chancellor in 1946.{{sfn|Allison|1965|p=93}} During Compton's time as Chancellor, the university formally desegregated its undergraduate divisions in 1952, named its first female full professor, and enrolled record numbers of students as wartime veterans returned to the United States. His reputation and connections in national scientific circles allowed him to recruit many nationally renowned scientific researchers to the university. Despite Compton's accomplishments, he was criticized then, and subsequently by historians, for moving too slowly toward full [[racial integration]], making Washington University the last major institution of higher learning in St. Louis to open its doors to [[African American]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Amy M. |last=Pfeiffenberger |title=Democracy at Home: The Struggle to Desegregate Washington University in the Postwar Era |journal=Gateway-Heritage |publisher=Missouri Historical Society|volume=10 |issue=3 |date=Winter 1989 |pages=17–24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Compton retired as Chancellor in 1954, but remained on the faculty as Distinguished Service Professor of Natural Philosophy until his retirement from the full-time faculty in 1961. In retirement he wrote ''Atomic Quest'', a personal account of his role in the Manhattan Project, which was published in 1956.{{sfn|Allison|1965|p=93}}

== Philosophy ==
Compton was one of a handful of scientists and philosophers to propose a two-stage model of [[free will]]. Others include [[William James]], [[Henri Poincaré]], [[Karl Popper]], [[Henry Margenau]], and [[Daniel Dennett]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.informationphilosopher.com/freedom/two-stage_models.html |title=Two-Stage Models for Free Will |publisher=The Information Philosopher |accessdate=July 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1931, Compton championed the idea of human freedom based on [[quantum indeterminacy]], and invented the notion of amplification of microscopic quantum events to bring [[Indeterminism|chance]] into the macroscopic world. In his somewhat bizarre mechanism, he imagined sticks of dynamite attached to his amplifier, anticipating the [[Schrödinger's cat]] paradox, which was published in 1935.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Science|volume= 74|issue=1911|pmid=17808216|doi=10.1126/science.74.1911.172 |page=172|title=The Uncertainty Principle and Free Will |date=August 14, 1931|last1=Compton|first1=A. H.|bibcode = 1931Sci....74..172C }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reacting to criticisms that his ideas made chance the direct cause of people's actions, Compton clarified the two-stage nature of his idea in an ''Atlantic Monthly'' article in 1955. First there is a range of random possible events, then one adds a determining factor in the act of choice.{{sfn|Compton|1967|p=121}}{{quote|A set of known physical conditions is not adequate to specify precisely what a forthcoming event will be. These conditions, insofar as they can be known, define instead a range of possible events from among which some particular event will occur. When one exercises freedom, by his act of choice he is himself adding a factor not supplied by the physical conditions and is thus himself determining what will occur. That he does so is known only to the person himself. From the outside one can see in his act only the working of physical law. It is the inner knowledge that he is in fact doing what he intends to do that tells the actor himself that he is free.{{sfn|Compton|1967|p=121}}}}

== Death and legacy ==
[[File:CGRO s37-96-010.jpg|thumb|The Compton Gamma Ray Observatory released into Earth's orbit in 1991]]
Compton died in [[Berkeley, California]], from a [[cerebral hemorrhage]] on March 15, 1962. He was survived by his wife and sons, and buried in the Wooster Cemetery in Wooster, Ohio.{{sfn|Allison|1965|p=94}} Before his death, he was Professor-at-Large at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] for Spring 1962.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Arthur Holly Compton: Systemwide|url=http://texts.cdlib.org/view?docId=hb0580022s&amp;doc.view=frames&amp;chunk.id=div00003&amp;toc.depth=1&amp;toc.id=|publisher=California Digital Library|accessdate=24 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Compton received many awards in his lifetime, including the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1927, the Matteucci Gold Medal in 1933, the [[Royal Society]]'s [[Hughes Medal]] and the [[Franklin Institute]]'s [[Benjamin Franklin Medal (Franklin Institute)|Benjamin Franklin Medal]] in 1940.{{sfn|Allison|1965|p=97}} He is commemorated in various ways.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21319">The '''artificial pancreas''' is a technology in development to help people with [[diabetes]], primarily type 1, automatically and continuously control their [[blood glucose level]] by providing the substitute [[endocrine]] functionality of a healthy [[pancreas]].

The endocrine functionality of the pancreas is provided by [[Pancreatic islets|islet cells]] which produce the hormones [[insulin]] and [[glucagon]]. Artificial pancreatic technology mimics the secretion of these hormones into the bloodstream in response to the body's changing blood glucose levels. Maintaining balanced blood sugar levels is crucial to the function of the brain, liver, and kidneys.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://columbiasurgery.org/pancreas/pancreas-and-its-functions|title=The Pancreas and Its Functions {{!}} Columbia University Department of Surgery|website=columbiasurgery.org|language=en|access-date=2018-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, for type 1 patients, it is necessary that the levels be kept balanced when the body cannot produce insulin itself.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

The artificial pancreas is a broad term for different [[Biological engineering|bio-engineering]] strategies currently in development to achieve these requirements. Different bio-engineering approaches under consideration include:

* the [[medical equipment]] approach—using an [[insulin pump]] under [[control theory|closed loop control]] using real-time feedback data from a [[continuous glucose monitor|continuous blood glucose monitor]].
* the [[Physiology|physiological]] approach—the development of a treatment with engineered [[Stem cell|stem cells]] to be integrated into the body to provide functional blood glucose regulation.

==Approaches==

===Medical equipment===
The medical equipment approach involves combining a continuous glucose monitor and an implanted insulin pump that can function together with a computer-controlled algorithm to replace the normal function of the pancreas.&lt;ref name="Gingras2017"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gingras V, Taleb N, Roy-Fleming A, Legault L, Rabasa-Lhoret R | title = The challenges of achieving postprandial glucose control using closed-loop systems in patients with type 1 diabetes | journal = Diabetes, Obesity &amp; Metabolism | volume = 20 | issue = 2 | pages = 245–256 | date = February 2018 | pmid = 28675686 | doi = 10.1111/dom.13052 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Uduku C, Oliver N | title = Pharmacological aspects of closed loop insulin delivery for type 1 diabetes | journal = Current Opinion in Pharmacology | volume = 36 | pages = 29–33 | date = October 2017 | pmid = 28802779 | doi = 10.1016/j.coph.2017.07.006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Graf A, McAuley SA, Sims C, Ulloa J, Jenkins AJ, Voskanyan G, O'Neal DN | title = Moving Toward a Unified Platform for Insulin Delivery and Sensing of Inputs Relevant to an Artificial Pancreas | journal = Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology | volume = 11 | issue = 2 | pages = 308–314 | date = March 2017 | pmid = 28264192 | pmc = 5478040 | doi = 10.1177/1932296816682762 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The development of continuous glucose monitors has led to the progress in artificial pancreas technology using this integrated system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Apablaza P, Soto N, Codner E | title = [From insulin pump and continuous glucose monitoring to the artificial pancreas] | journal = Revista Medica De Chile | volume = 145 | issue = 5 | pages = 630–640 | date = May 2017 | pmid = 28898340 | doi = 10.4067/S0034-98872017000500011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Continuous Glucose Monitors ====
[[Image:Artificial Pancreas.jpg|thumb|Artificial pancreas feedback system |alt=]]

The original devices for use in type 1 diabetes were [[Glucose meter|blood glucose meters]]. Continuous blood glucose monitors are one of the set of devices that make up an artificial pancreas device system, the other being an insulin pump, and a glucose meter to calibrate the device.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fda.gov/medicaldevices/productsandmedicalprocedures/homehealthandconsumer/consumerproducts/artificialpancreas/ucm259548.htm#artificial|title=Artificial Pancreas Device System - What is the pancreas?  What is an artificial pancreas device system?|last=Health|first=Center for Devices and Radiological|website=www.fda.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Continuous glucose monitors are a more recent breakthrough and have begun to hit the markets for patient use after approval from the FDA. Both the traditional and the continuous monitor require manual insulin delivery or carbohydrate intake depending on the readings from the devices. While the traditional blood glucose meters require the user to prick their finger every few hours to obtain data, continuous monitors use sensors placed just under the skin on the arm or abdomen to deliver blood sugar level data to receivers or smartphone apps as often as every few minutes.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The sensors can be used for up to ten days.  A number of different continuous monitors are currently approved by the FDA.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.managedcaremag.com/archives/2018/7/first-four-continuous-glucose-monitors|title=The First Four Continuous Glucose Monitors|date=2018-07-04|work=Managed Care magazine|access-date=2018-11-07|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first continuous glucose monitor (CGM) was approved in December 2016. Developed by [[Dexcom]], the G5 Mobile Continuous Monitoring System requires users to prick their fingers twice a day (as opposed to the typical average 8 times daily with the traditional meters) in order to calibrate the sensors. The sensors last up to seven days. The device uses Bluetooth technology to warn the user either through a handheld receiver or app on a smartphone if blood glucose levels reach below a certain point. The cost for this device excluding any co-insurance is an estimated $4,800 a year.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
[[File:BGM twopart.JPG|alt=The white sensor is fixed to the upper arm and scanned with the reader. The reader is showing (top to bottom) days to replacement of sensor (11), current BG (7,4) &amp; change (-&gt; i.e. steady) and a diagram of the latest BG levels.|thumb|Blood glucose meter FreeStyle Libre from Abbott. ]]
[[Abbott Laboratories|Abbott Laboratories']] FreeStyle Libre CGM was approved in September 2017. It does not support smartphone use. This device does not require finger pricks at all and the sensor, placed on the upper arm, lasts 10 days. The estimated cost for this monitor is $1,300 a year.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Dexcom's next G6 model CGM was approved in March 2018, which can last up to ten days and does not need finger prick calibration. Like Medtronic's monitor, it can predict glucose level trends. It is compatible for integration into insulin pumps. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== Closed-Loop Systems ====
Unlike the continuous sensor alone, the closed-loop system requires no user input in response to reading from the monitor; the monitor and insulin pump system automatically delivers the correct amount of hormone calculated from the readings transmitted. The system is what makes up the artificial pancreas device.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Elleri D, Dunger DB, Hovorka R | title = Closed-loop insulin delivery for treatment of type 1 diabetes | language = En | journal = BMC Medicine | volume = 9 | issue = 1 | pages = 120 | date = November 2011 | pmid = 22071283 | doi = 10.1186/1741-7015-9-120 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== MiniMed 670G =====
In September 2016, the FDA approved the [[Medtronic MiniMed 670G]], which was the first approved hybrid [[Closed-loop transfer function|closed loop system]]. The device senses a diabetic person's [[Basal (medicine)|basal]] insulin requirement and automatically adjusts its delivery to the body.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://wayback.archive-it.org/7993/20170111141252/http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/ProductsandMedicalProcedures/DeviceApprovalsandClearances/Recently-ApprovedDevices/ucm522764.htm|title=Recently-Approved Devices - The 670G System - P160017|last=Health|first=Center for Devices and Radiological|website=wayback.archive-it.org|language=en|access-date=2018-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is made up of a continuous glucose monitor, an insulin pump, and a glucose meter for calibration. It automatically functions to modify the level of insulin delivery based off the detection of blood glucose levels by continuous monitor. It does this by sending the blood glucose data through an algorithm that analyzes and makes the subsequent adjustments.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The system has two modes. Manual mode lets the user choose the rate at which basal insulin is delivered. Auto mode regulates basal insulin levels from the continuous monitor's readings every five minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.medtronicdiabetes.com/products/minimed-670g-insulin-pump-system|title=MiniMed 670G Insulin Pump System {{!}} World's First Hybrid Closed Loop System|website=www.medtronicdiabetes.com|language=en|access-date=2018-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The device was originally available only to those aged 14 or older, and in June 2018 was approved by the FDA for use in children aged 7-14. Families have reported better sleep quality from use of the new system, as they do not have to worry about manually checking blood glucose levels during the night.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.medtronicdiabetes.com/loop-blog/fda-approves-minimed-670g-system-children-7-13/|title=FDA Approves the MiniMed 670G System for Children 7-13 - The LOOP Blog|website=www.medtronicdiabetes.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The full cost of the system is $3700, but patients have the opportunity to get it for less.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.medtronicdiabetes.com/loop-blog/update-minimed-670g-availability/|title=Update on MiniMed 670G Availability|website=www.medtronicdiabetes.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== iLet Bionic Pancreas =====
A team at [[Boston University]] working in collaboration with [[Massachusetts General Hospital]] on a dual hormone artificial pancreas system &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bionicpancreas.org/|title=bionicpancreas.org|website=www.bionicpancreas.org|access-date=2018-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; began clinical trials on their device called the Bionic Pancreas in 2008.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.healthline.com/diabetesmine/beta-bionics-ilet-update#1|title=Update on the iLet Bionic Pancreas Closed Loop System|work=Healthline|access-date=2018-11-07|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, the Public Benefit Corporation [[Beta Bionics]] was formed. In conjunction with the formation of the company, Beta Bionics changed the preliminary name for their device from the Bionic Pancreas to the iLet.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The device uses a closed-loop system to deliver both insulin and glucagon in response to sensed blood glucose levels. While not yet approved for public use, the 4th generation iLet prototype, presented in 2017, is around the size of an iPhone, with a touchscreen interface. It contain two chambers for both insulin and glucagon, and the device is configurable for use with only one hormone, or both.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.bu.edu/today/2017/bionic-pancreas-clinical-trial/|title=Bionic Pancreas Passes Critical Science Hurdle {{!}} BU Today {{!}} Boston University|work=BU Today|access-date=2018-11-07|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; While trials continue to be run, the iLet has a projected final approval for the insulin-only system in 2020.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

===== Current Studies =====
Four studies on different artificial pancreas systems are being conducted starting in 2017 and going into the near future. The projects are funded by the [[National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases]](NIDDK), and are the final part of testing the devices before applying for approval for use. Participants in the studies are able to live their lives at home while using the devices and being monitored remotely for safety, efficacy, and a number of other factors.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://medlineplus.gov/magazine/issues/spring17/articles/spring17pg15-16.html|title=The Miracle of an Artificial Pancreas {{!}} NIH MedlinePlus the Magazine|access-date=2018-11-28|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The International Diabetes Closed-Loop trial,&lt;ref&gt;{{ClinicalTrialsGov|NCT02844517|International Diabetes Closed Loop (iDCL) Trial: Research Site Training Protocol}}&lt;/ref&gt; led by researchers from the [[University of Virginia]], is testing a closed-loop system called inControl, which has a smartphone user interface. 240 people of ages 14 and up are participating for 6 months.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

A full-year trial led by researchers from the [[University of Cambridge]] started in May 2017 and has enrolled an estimated 150 participants of ages 6 to 18 years.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The artificial pancreas system being studied uses a smartphone and has a low glucose feature to improve glucose level control.&lt;ref&gt;{{ClinicalTrialsGov|NCT02925299|Day and Night Closed-loop in Young People With Type 1 Diabetes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The International Diabetes Center in Minneapolis, Minnesota, in collaboration with [[Rabin Medical Center|Schneider Children's Medical Center]] in Petah Tikva, Israel, are planning a 6-month study that will begin in early 2019 and will involve 112 adolescents and young adults, ages 14 to 30.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{ClinicalTrialsGov|NCT03040414|Fuzzy Logic Automated Insulin Regulation}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main object of the study is to compare the current Medtronic 670G system to a new Medtronic-developed system. The new system has programming that aims to improve glucose control around mealtime, which is still a big challenge in the field.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

The current 6-month study lead by the Bionic Pancreas team started in mid-2018 and enrolled 312 participants of ages 18 and above.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

=== Physiological ===
[[Image:Bio-artificial pancreas with Islet Sheet technology.JPG|thumb|right|300px|'''The Bio-artificial pancreas''': this diagram shows a cross section of [[tissue engineering|bio-engineered tissue]] with encapsulated [[islets of Langerhans|islet cells]] which deliver [[endocrine]] [[pancreas#Function|hormones]] in response to [[glucose]].]]

The biotechnical company Defymed, based in France, is developing an implantable bio-artificial device called MailPan which features a bio-compatible membrane with [[Semipermeable membrane|selective permeability]] to encapsulate different cells types, including pancreatic [[Beta cell|beta cells]].&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.calcalistech.com/ctech/articles/0,7340,L-3749642,00.html|title=Israeli and French Biotech Companies Partner to Fight Diabetes With Bio-Artificial Pancreas|date=2018-11-12|work=CTECH - www.calcalistech.com|access-date=2018-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The implantation of the device does not require conjunctive immuno-supressive therapy because the membrane prevents antibodies of the patient from entering the device and damaging the encapsulated cells. After being surgically implanted, the membrane sheet will be viable for years.The cells that the device holds can be produced from stem cells rather than human donors, and may also be replaced over time using input and output connections without surgery.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.defymed.com/mailpan/|title=MailPan ® BioArtificial Pancreas {{!}} Defymed, advanced therapies inspired for you|work=Defymed|access-date=2018-11-28|language=fr-FR}}&lt;/ref&gt; Defymed is partially funded by JDRF, formerly known as the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation, but is now defined as an organization for all ages and all stages of type 1 diabetes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180212005894/en/Innovative-Medical-Devices-Treatment-Diabetes-Defymed-Strengthens|title=Innovative Medical Devices for the Treatment of Diabetes, Defymed Strengthens Its Position as a Worldwide Leader|access-date=2018-11-28|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.jdrf.ca/who-we-are/what-does-jdrf-stand-for/|title=What Does JDRF Stand For?|last=Canada|first=JDRF|website=JDRF Canada|language=en|access-date=2018-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2018, it was announced that Defymed would partner with the Israel-based Kadimastem, a bio-pharmaceutical company developing stem-cell based regenerative therapies, to receive a two-year grant worth approximately $1.47 million for the development of a bio-artificial pancreas that would treat type 1 diabetes.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.kadimastem.com/|title=Kadimastem - Stem Cell to Cure Diseases|website=www.kadimastem.com|access-date=2018-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kadimastem's stem cell technology uses differentiation of human embryonic stem cells to obtain pancreatic endocrine cells. These include insulin-producing beta cells, as well as alpha cells, which produce glucagon. Both cells arrange in islet-like clusters, mimicking the structure of the pancreas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.kadimastem.com/regenerative-medicine/17/diabetes|title=Diabetes - Kadimastem|website=www.kadimastem.com|access-date=2018-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The aim of the partnership is to combine both technologies in a bio-artificial pancreas device, which releases insulin in response to blood glucose levels, to bring to clinical trial stages.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

The San Diego, California based biotech company ViaCyte has also developed a product aiming to provide a solution for type 1 diabetes which uses an encapsulation device made of a semi-permeable immune reaction-protective membrane. The device contains pancreatic [[Progenitor cell|progenitor cells]] that have been differentiated from embryonic stem cells.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/two-year-data-from-viacytes-step-one-clinical-trial-presented-at-ada-2018-300671013.html|title=Two-year Data from ViaCyte's STEP ONE Clinical Trial Presented at ADA 2018|last=Inc.|first=ViaCyte,|website=www.prnewswire.com|language=en|access-date=2018-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://viacyte.com/products/pec%E2%80%90encap-vc-01|title=PEC‐Encap™ (VC-01™)|work=Viacyte, Inc.|access-date=2018-11-29|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; After surgical implantation in an outpatient procedure, the cells mature into endocrine cells which arrange in islet-like clusters and mimic the function of the pancreas, producing insulin and glucagon.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://viacyte.com/|title=Home|work=Viacyte, Inc.|access-date=2018-11-29|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Schulz TC | title = Concise Review: Manufacturing of Pancreatic Endoderm Cells for Clinical Trials in Type 1 Diabetes | journal = Stem Cells Translational Medicine | volume = 4 | issue = 8 | pages = 927–31 | date = August 2015 | pmid = 26062982 | pmc = 4511151 | doi = 10.5966/sctm.2015-0058 }}&lt;/ref&gt;The technology advanced from pre-clinical studies to FDA approval for phase 1 clinical trials in 2014, and presented two-year data from the trial in June 2018.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; They reported that their product, called PEC-Encap, has so far been safe and well tolerated in patients at a dose below therapeutic levels. The encapsulated cells were able to survive and mature after implantation, and immune system rejection was decreased due to the protective membrane. The second phase of the trial will evaluate the efficacy of the product.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; ViaCyte has also been receiving financial support from JDRF on this project.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

==Initiatives around the globe==
In the United States in 2006, JDRF (formerly the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation) launched a multi-year initiative to help accelerate the development, regulatory approval, and acceptance of continuous glucose monitoring and artificial pancreas technology.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jdrf.org/artificialpancreas Artificial Pancreas Project : JDRF&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.statnews.com/2017/08/10/type-1-diabetes-insurance-companies/|title=Insurers can profit while improving the lives of people with type 1 diabetes|last=KMorandi says|date=2017-08-10|website=STAT|access-date=2017-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Asa Lees''' was a firm of textile machine manufacturers in [[Oldham]], Lancashire. Their headquarters was the Soho Iron Works, Greenacres. It was second only in size to [[Platt Brothers]].

==Early history==
Samuel Lees founded a roller making works in the 1790s, it was called the Soho Works. His second son Asa Lees (1816–62) inherited the premises. He expanded the business, exporting [[fustian]] [[power loom]]s to [[St Petersberg]]. He abandoned looms to concentrate on manufacturing preparation and spinning machinery. The Soho Cotton mills was converted to a [[spinning mule|Mule carriage]] works.&lt;ref name=Gurr&amp;Hunt&gt;{{citation |last=Gurr |first=Duncan |last2= Hunt |first2=Julian |year=1998 |title=The Cotton Mills of Oldham |publisher= Oldham Education &amp; Leisure |isbn=0-902809-46-6|page=13|url=http://www.spinningtheweb.org.uk/a_results.php?x=5&amp;y=7&amp;QueryName=KeyWord&amp;KeyWords=The+Cotton+Mills+of+Oldham%2C+brief+history+and+gazetteer}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Asa Lees became a limited company in 1868, four years after Platts and the shares were quoted on the Oldham share market until the 1890s. It never published its accounts, though its dividends were consistently higher than Platts, and remained profitable in 1928 when Platts made a loss. They were conservative in their trading, dealing only with reliable firms. They did not push for exports. They experienced rapid expansion in the 1880s under the management of Robert Taylor (1823–1912) and production peaked in 1906 when they were employing 3000 men.&lt;ref name=Gurr&amp;Hunt/&gt;

==Later history==
In the recession of the 1930s, [[Platt Brothers]], [[Howard &amp; Bullough|Howard and Bullough]], [[Brooks &amp; Doxey|Brooks and Doxey]], Asa Lees, [[Dobson &amp; Barlow|Dobson and Barlow]], [[Joseph Hibbert(manufacturer)|Joseph Hibbert]], [[John Hetherington &amp; Sons|John Hetherington]] and [[Tweedales &amp; Smalley|Tweedales and Smalley]] merged to become  [[Textile Machinery Makers Ltd]]., but the individual units continued to trade under their own names until the 1970, when they were rationalised into one company called Platt UK Ltd.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.platt.co.uk/history2.htm|title=Platt maker of quality textile machinery and parts|accessdate=2009-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1991 the company name changed to Platt Saco Lowell.

*James Bullough improved his own loom by inventing various components, including the 'self-acting temple' that kept the woven cloth at its correct width, the weft fork (patented 1841 but disputed by Osbaldeston) and a loose reed that allowed the lathe to back away on encountering a shuttle trapped in the warp. Bullough also invented a simple but effective warning device which rang a bell every time the warp thread broke on his loom. He worked with William Kenworthy at Brookhouse Mills, with whom he applied his inventions to develop an improved power loom that later became known as the "Lancashire Loom."
*James Bullough in partnership with John Howard at Globe Works invented the slasher, which founded the company's success.

An '''audio power amplifier''' (or '''power amp''') is an [[electronic amplifier]] that reproduces low-power electronic audio signals such as the signal from radio receiver or electric guitar [[pickup (music technology)|pickup]] at a level that is strong enough for driving (or powering) [[loudspeaker]]s or [[headphones]]. This includes both amplifiers used in home audio systems and musical [[instrument amplifier]]s like [[guitar amplifier]]s.  It is the final electronic stage in a typical audio playback [[Signal chain (signal processing chain)|chain]] before the signal is sent to the loudspeakers and [[speaker enclosure]]s.

The preceding stages in such a chain are low power audio amplifiers which perform tasks like [[preamplifier|pre-amplification]] of the signal (this is particularly associated with [[record turntable]] signals, [[microphone]] signals and electric instrument signals from pickups, such as the electric guitar and electric bass), [[equalization (audio)|equalization]] (e.g., adjusting the bass and treble), [[Tone control circuits|tone controls]], [[mixing console|mixing different input signals]] or [[effects unit|adding electronic effects]] such as [[reverb]]. The inputs can also be any number of audio sources like [[record player]]s, [[CD player]]s, [[digital audio player]]s and [[cassette player]]s. Most audio power amplifiers require these low-level inputs, which are [[line level]].

While the input signal to an audio power amplifier, such as the signal from an electric guitar, may measure only a few hundred [[watt|microwatts]], its output may be a few watts for small consumer electronics devices, such as [[clock radio]]s, tens or hundreds of watts for a [[home stereo system]], several thousand watts for a [[nightclub]]'s sound system or tens of thousands of watts for a large rock concert [[sound reinforcement system]]. While power amplifiers are available in standalone units, typically aimed at the [[hi-fi]] audiophile market (a niche market) of audio enthusiasts and [[sound reinforcement system]] professionals, most [[consumer electronics]] sound products, such as [[clock radio]]s, [[boom box]]es and [[television]]s have relatively small power amplifiers that are integrated inside the chassis of the main product.

== History ==
[[File:First Audion amplifier 1914.jpg|thumb|upright=0.6|De Forest's prototype audio amplifier of 1914.]]

The audio amplifier was invented around 1912 by [[Lee De Forest]], made possible by his invention  of the first practical amplifying electrical component, the [[triode]] [[vacuum tube]] (or "valve" in British English) in 1907. The [[triode]] was a three terminal device with a control grid that can modulate the flow of electrons from the filament to the plate. The triode [[Valve amplifier|vacuum amplifier]] was used to make the first [[AM broadcasting|AM radio]].&lt;ref&gt;http://nobelprize.org/educational_games/physics/transistor/history/ The Transistor in a Century of Electronics&lt;/ref&gt; Early audio power amplifiers were based on [[vacuum tubes]] and some of these achieved notably high audio quality (e.g., the [[Williamson amplifier]] of 1947-9). Audio power amplifiers based on transistors became practical with the wide availability of inexpensive transistors in the late 1960s. Since the 1970s, most modern audio amplifiers are based on [[Solid-state (electronics)|solid state]] devices ([[transistor]]s such as [[BJT]]s, [[field effect transistor|FET]]s and [[MOSFET]]s). Transistor-based amplifiers are lighter in weight, more reliable and require less maintenance than tube amplifiers. In the 2010s, there are still audio enthusiasts, musicians (particularly [[electric guitar]]ists, [[electric bass]]ists, [[Hammond organ]] players and [[Fender Rhodes]] [[electric piano]] players, among others), audio engineers and [[music producer]]s who prefer tube-based amplifiers, and what is perceived as a  "warmer" [[valve sound|tube sound]].
{{breakafterimages}}

== Design parameters ==
[[File:Poweramps.JPG|thumb|upright=0.8|Three rack-mounted audio power amplifiers used in a [[sound reinforcement system]]. ]]

Key design parameters for audio power amplifiers are [[frequency response]], [[gain (electronics)|gain]], [[signal noise|noise]], and [[distortion]]. These are interdependent; increasing gain often leads to undesirable increases in noise and distortion. While [[negative feedback]] actually reduces the gain, it also reduces distortion. Most audio amplifiers are linear amplifiers operating in [[Power amplifier classes|class AB]].

Until the 1970s, most amplifiers were [[tube amplifiers]] which used [[vacuum tube]]s. During the 1970s, tube amps were increasingly replaced with [[transistor]]-based amplifiers, which were lighter in weight, more reliable, and lower maintenance. Nevertheless, there are still [[niche market]]s of consumers who continue to use tube amplifiers and tube preamplifiers in the 2010s, such as with home [[hi-fi]] enthusiasts, [[audio engineer]]s and [[music producer]]s (who use tube preamplifiers in studio recordings to "warm up" microphone signals) and electric guitarists, electric bassists and [[Hammond organ]] players, of whom a minority continue to use tube preamps, tube power amps and tube [[effects unit]]s. While hi-fi enthusiasts and audio engineers doing live sound or monitoring tracks in the studio typically seek out amplifiers with the lowest distortion, electric instrument players in genres such as [[blues]], [[rock music]] and [[heavy metal music]], among others, use tube amplifiers because they like the natural overdrive that tube amps produce when pushed hard.

In the 2000s, the [[Class-D amplifier]], which is much more efficient than Class AB amplifiers, is widely used in [[consumer electronic]]s audio products, [[bass amplifier]]s and [[sound reinforcement system]] gear, as Class D amplifiers are much lighter in weight and produce much less heat.

==Filters and preamplifiers==

Since modern digital devices, including CD and DVD players, radio receivers and tape decks already provide a "flat" signal at line level, the preamp is not needed other than as a volume control and source selector. One alternative to a separate preamp is to simply use passive volume and switching controls, sometimes integrated into a power amplifier to form an ''integrated amplifier''.

==Power output stages==
The final stage of amplification, after preamplifiers, is the output stage, where the highest demands are placed on the transistors or tubes. For this reason, the design choices made around the output device (for single-ended output stages, such as in [[single-ended triode]] amplifiers) or devices (for [[Push–pull output|push-pull]] output stages), such as the [[Amplifier#Power_amplifier_classes|Class of operation]] of the output devices is often taken as the description of the whole power amplifier. For example, a Class B amplifier will probably have just the high power output devices operating cut off for half of each cycle, while the other devices (such as differential amplifier, voltage amplifier and possibly even driver transistors) operate in Class A. In a [[Output transformerless|transformerless output stage]], the devices are essentially in series with the power supply and output [[Electrical load|load]] (such as a [[loudspeaker]]), possibly via some large capacitor and/or small resistances.

==Further developments==

For some years following the introduction of solid state amplifiers, their perceived sound did not have the excellent audio quality of the best valve amplifiers (see [[valve audio amplifier]]). This led [[audiophile]]s to believe that "tube sound" or [[valve sound]] had an intrinsic quality due to the vacuum tube technology itself. In 1970, [[Matti Otala]] published a paper on the origin of a previously unobserved form of distortion: transient [[intermodulation distortion]] (TIM),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1109/TAU.1970.1162117| title = Transient distortion in transistorized audio power amplifiers| journal = IEEE Transactions on Audio and Electroacoustics| volume = 18| issue = 3| pages = 234| year = 1970| last1 = Otala | first1 = M.}}&lt;/ref&gt; later also called [[slew-induced distortion]] (SID) by others.&lt;ref&gt;Walter G. Jung, Mark L. Stephens, and Craig C. Todd (June 1979), "An overview of SID and TIM", ''Audio''&lt;/ref&gt; TIM distortion was found to occur during very rapid increases in amplifier output voltage.&lt;ref&gt;"Circuit Design Modifications for Minimizing Transient Intermodulation Distortion in Audio Amplifiers", Matti Otala, Journal of Audio Engineering Society, Vol 20 # 5, June 1972&lt;/ref&gt; 

TIM did not appear at steady state sine tone measurements, helping to hide it from design engineers prior to 1970. Problems with TIM distortion stem from reduced open loop frequency response of solid state amplifiers. Further works of Otala and other authors found the solution for TIM distortion, including increasing [[slew rate]], decreasing preamp frequency bandwidth, and the insertion of a lag compensation circuit in the input stage of the amplifier.&lt;ref&gt;Distribution of the Phonograph Signal Rate of Change, Lammasniemi, Jorma; Nieminen, Kari, Journal of Audio Engineering Society, Vol. 28 # 5, May 1980.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Psychoacoustic Detection Threshold of Transient Intermodulation Distortion", Petri-Larmi, M.; Otala, M.; Lammasniemi, J. Journal of Audio Engineering Society, Vol 28 # 3, March 1980&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Discussion of practical design features that can provoke or lessen slew-rate limiting and transient intermodulation in audio amplifiers can also be found for example in chapter 9 in [[John Linsley Hood]]'s 'The Art of Linear Electronics' (Butterworth-Heinemann, Oxford, 1993).&lt;/ref&gt; In high quality modern amplifiers the open loop response is at least 20&amp;nbsp;kHz, canceling TIM distortion.

The next step in advanced design was the Baxandall Theorem, created by Peter Baxandall in England.&lt;ref&gt;"Audio power amplifier design", Peter Baxandall. Wireless World magazine, February 1979&lt;/ref&gt; This theorem introduced the concept of comparing the ratio between the input distortion and the output distortion of an amplifier. This new idea helped audio design engineers to better evaluate the distortion processes within an amplifier.

== Applications ==

Important applications include [[public address]] systems, theatrical and concert [[sound reinforcement system]]s, and domestic systems such as a [[High fidelity|stereo]] or [[Home cinema|home-theatre system]].  [[Instrument amplifier]]s including [[guitar amplifiers]] and electric [[keyboard amplifier]]s also use audio power amplifiers. In some cases, the power amplifier for an instrument amplifier is integrated into a single amplifier "head" which contains a preamplifier, tone controls, and electronic effects. These components may be mounted in a wooden speaker cabinet to create a "combo amplifier". Musicians with unique performance needs and/or a need for very powerful amplification  may create a custom setup with separate [[rackmount]] preamplifiers, equalizers, and a power amplifier mounted in a 19" [[road case]].

Power amplifiers are available in standalone units, which are used by [[hi-fi]] audio enthusiasts and designers of [[public address system]]s (PA systems) and [[sound reinforcement system]]s. A hi-fi user of power amplifiers may have a stereo power amplifier to drive left and right speakers and a "monoblock" single channel power amplifier to drive a [[subwoofer]]. The number of power amplifiers used in a sound reinforcement setting depends on the size of the venue. A small [[coffeehouse]] may have a single power amp driving two PA speakers. A [[nightclub]] may have several power amps for the main speakers, one or more power amps for the [[Foldback (sound engineering)|monitor speakers]] (pointing towards the band) and an additional power amp for the subwoofer. A stadium concert may have a large number of power amps mounted in racks. Most [[consumer electronics]] sound products, such as [[TV]]s, [[boom box]]es, [[home cinema]] sound systems, Casio and Yamaha [[electronic keyboard]]s, [[guitar amplifier|"combo" guitar amps]] and car stereos have power amplifiers integrated inside the chassis of the main product.

'''Barium azide''' is an inorganic [[azide]] with the formula Ba(N&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Like most azides, it is explosive. It is less sensitive to mechanical shock than [[lead azide]].

==Uses==
Barium azide can be used to make azides of [[Magnesium azide|magnesium]], [[sodium azide|sodium]], [[potassium azide|potassium]], [[lithium azide|lithium]], [[rubidium azide|rubidium]] and [[zinc azide|zinc]] with their respective sulfates.&lt;ref name="Energetic Materials Vol.1"&gt;{{cite book|title=Physics and Chemistry of the Inorganic Azides|publisher=[[Plenum Press]]|year=1977|isbn=9781489950093|editor1=H.

:Ba(N&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; → 2LiN&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + BaSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;

It can also be used as a source for high pure nitrogen by heating:
:Ba(N&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → Ba + 3N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

This reaction liberates metallic barium, which used as a [[getter]] in vacuum applications.

[[File:CindyCrawfordOct09.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Supermodel [[Cindy Crawford]] is known for her beauty mark]]

A '''beauty mark''' or '''beauty spot''' is a [[euphemism]] for a type of dark facial [[Melanocytic nevus|mole]], so named because such [[birthmark]]s are sometimes considered an attractive feature.&lt;ref name="ariel"&gt;Ariel, Irving M. (1981). A Historical Introduction: Is the beauty mark a mark of beauty or a potentially dangerous cancer? ''Malignant Melanoma,'' Appleton-Century-Crofts, {{ISBN|978-0-8385-6114-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Medically, such "beauty marks" are generally [[melanocytic nevus]], more specifically the compound variant. Moles of this type may also be located elsewhere on the body, and may also be considered beauty marks if located on the face, shoulder, neck or breast. Artificial beauty marks have been fashionable in some periods.

==Artificial beauty mark==
[[File:Portrait of María Rosa de Rivera.jpg|thumb|right|A ''chiqueador'' on a lady's temple, Lima, Peru, 1785]]
Artificial beauty marks became fashionable in sixteenth-century France, and the fashion persisted into the eighteenth century, applied to the face as a form of [[make-up]]. They were often in fanciful shapes such as hearts or stars. Besides their decorative value, they could hide [[smallpox]] scars or [[syphilis]] sores.&lt;ref name="artic"&gt;"Beauty Marks Go Global", '''ARTicle''', blog of the [[Art Institute of Chicago]], [http://www.artic.edu/blog/2015/01/14/beauty-marks-go-global January 14, 2015]&lt;/ref&gt; They could be purchased as silk or velvet patches known as "mouches" (flies). [[Alexander Pope]]'s 1712 poem ''[[The Rape of the Lock]]'' mentions such patches as indicators of "secular love":&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/~pvm/Lock.html | title=Pope: Rape of the Lock | publisher=University of St Andrews | date=16 March 1999 | accessdate=1 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;Here Files of Pins extend their shining Rows,
Puffs, Powders, Patches, Bibles, Billet-doux.
Now awful Beauty puts on all its Arms;
The Fair each moment rises in her Charms,
Repairs her Smiles, awakens ev'ry Grace,
And calls forth all the Wonders of her Face;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://poetry.eserver.org/rape-of-the-lock.html | title=The Rape of the Lock: An Heroi-Comical Poem |at=Canto 1 | date=May 1712 | accessdate=1 December 2013 | author=Pope, Alexander}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The fashion spread to Spain and the [[Spanish Empire]] in the eighteenth century, under the name ''chiqueador''.&lt;ref name="artic"/&gt;

Natural beauty marks are also often enhanced with color from an [[eyebrow pencil]] or pen.&lt;ref name="cloud"&gt;Barbara Cloud, "Marks of Distinction", ''Chicago Tribute'', [http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1990-04-25/entertainment/9002030500_1_beauty-spot-jean-patchett-mole April 25, 1990]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Monroe piercing]] has gained popularity in recent years as a flexible way of approximating a beauty mark.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

==In fiction==
In the conclusion of the book ''[[The Silence of the Lambs (novel)|The Silence of the Lambs]]'', the heroine [[Clarice Starling]] gains an artificial beauty mark when burnt gunpowder gets lodged in the flesh of her cheek. She retains this mark in the sequel novel ''[[Hannibal (Harris novel)|Hannibal]]''. This symbolism (along with Dr. Lecter's [[polydactylism]]) did not get carried over into the film.{{cn|date=April 2018}}

[[Joan Crawford]] had a prominent beauty mark in her role as Sadie Thompson in ''[[Rain (1932 film)|Rain]]''.

'''Business intelligence''' ('''BI''') comprises the strategies and technologies used by enterprises for the [[data analysis]] of [[business information]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Dedić N. &amp; Stanier C.|year=2016|title=Measuring the Success of Changes to Existing Business Intelligence Solutions to Improve Business Intelligence Reporting.

Common functions of business intelligence technologies include [[business reporting|reporting]], [[online analytical processing]], [[analytics]], [[data mining]], [[process mining]], [[complex event processing]], [[business performance management]], [[benchmarking]], [[text mining]], [[Predictive Analysis|predictive analytics]] and [[Prescriptive Analytics|prescriptive analytics]]. BI technologies can handle large amounts of structured and sometimes unstructured data to help identify, develop and otherwise create new strategic [[business opportunities]]. They aim to allow for the easy interpretation of these [[big data]]. Identifying new opportunities and implementing an effective strategy based on [[insight]]s can provide [[business]]es with a competitive market advantage and long-term stability.&lt;ref&gt;({{cite book |title= Business Intelligence Success Factors: Tools for Aligning Your Business in the Global Economy |last= Rud|first= Olivia |year= 2009|publisher= Wiley &amp; Sons|location= Hoboken, N.J|isbn= 978-0-470-39240-9 |page= |pages= |url= |accessdate=}})&lt;/ref&gt;

Business intelligence can be used by enterprises to support a wide range of business decisions ranging from operational to strategic. Basic operating decisions include product positioning or pricing.  [[Business strategy|Strategic business]] decisions involve priorities, [[goal]]s and directions at the broadest level. In all cases, BI is most effective when it combines data derived from the market in which a [[company]] operates (external data) with data from company sources internal to the business such as financial and operations data (internal data). When combined, external and internal data can provide a complete picture which, in effect, creates an "intelligence" that cannot be derived from any singular set of data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1= Coker| first1= Frank | title= Pulse: Understanding the Vital Signs of Your Business | publisher= Ambient Light Publishing

Often{{quantify|date=April 2017}} BI applications use data gathered from a [[data warehouse]] (DW) or from a [[data mart]], and the concepts of BI and DW combine as "BI/DW"&lt;ref&gt;

or as "BIDW". A data warehouse contains a copy of analytical data that facilitate [[decision support]].

==History==
The earliest known use of the term ''business intelligence'' is in Richard Millar Devens' ''Cyclopædia of Commercial and Business Anecdotes'' (1865). Devens used the term to describe how the banker [[Sir Henry Furnese, 1st Baronet|Sir Henry Furnese]] gained profit by receiving and acting upon information about his environment, prior to his competitors:
{{quote|Throughout Holland, Flanders, France, and Germany, he maintained a complete and perfect train of business intelligence. The news of the many battles fought was thus received first by him, and the [[Siege of Namur (1695)|fall of Namur]] added to his profits, owing to his early receipt of the news.|author=Devens |source=p.&amp;nbsp;210}}

The ability to collect and react accordingly based on the information retrieved, Devens says, is central to business intelligence.&lt;ref name="Miller Devens"&gt;{{cite book|last=Miller Devens|first=Richard|title=Cyclopaedia of Commercial and Business Anecdotes; Comprising Interesting Reminiscences and Facts, Remarkable Traits and Humors of Merchants, Traders, Bankers Etc. in All Ages and Countries|url=https://books.google.dk/books?id=9MspAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA210&amp;dq=%22business+intelligence%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=a5EPTdaRIsOWnAeVyYHQDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=%22business%20intelligence%22&amp;f=false|publisher=D. Appleton and company|accessdate=15 February 2014|page=210}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When [[Hans Peter Luhn]], a researcher at [[IBM]], used the term ''business intelligence'' in an article published in 1958, he employed the ''[[Webster's Dictionary]]'' definition of intelligence: "the ability to apprehend the interrelationships of presented facts in such a way as to guide action towards a desired goal."&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal|url= http://www.research.ibm.com/journal/rd/024/ibmrd0204H.pdf|doi=10.1147/rd.24.0314|title= A Business Intelligence System|author=H P Luhn |authorlink= Hans Peter Luhn |year= 1958 |journal= IBM Journal|volume= 2|issue= 4|pages= 314|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080913121526/http://www.research.ibm.com/journal/rd/024/ibmrd0204H.pdf|archivedate=2008-09-13}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Business intelligence as it is understood today is said to have evolved from the [[decision support system]]s (DSS) that began in the 1960s and developed throughout the mid-1980s.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} DSS originated in the computer-aided models created to assist with [[decision making]] and planning.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

In 1989, Howard Dresner (later a [[Gartner]] analyst) proposed ''business intelligence'' as an [[umbrella term]] to describe "concepts and methods to improve business decision making by using fact-based support systems."&lt;ref name=power&gt;{{cite web |url= http://dssresources.com/history/dsshistory.html |title= A Brief History of Decision Support Systems, version 4.0 |accessdate=10 July 2008 |author= D. J. Power |date= 10 March 2007|publisher= DSSResources.COM }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was not until the late 1990s that this usage was widespread.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dssresources.com/history/dsshistory.html |title=A Brief History of Decision Support Systems |last=Power |first=D. J. |accessdate=1 November 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics{{who|date=August 2018}} see BI merely as an evolution of [[business reporting]] together with the advent of increasingly powerful and easy-to-use [[data analysis]] tools. In this respect it has also been criticized{{by whom|date=August 2018}} as a marketing buzzword in the context of the "[[big data]]" surge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Decoding big data buzzwords|year=2015|quote=BI refers to the approaches, tools, mechanisms that organizations can use to keep a finger on the pulse of their businesses. Also referred by unsexy versions -- “dashboarding”, “MIS” or “reporting.”|publisher=cio.com|url=http://www.cio.com/article/2919082/big-data/what-are-they-talking-about-decoding-big-data-buzzwords.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
According to [[Forrester Research]], business intelligence is "a set of methodologies, processes, architectures, and technologies that transform raw data into meaningful and useful information used to enable more effective strategic, tactical, and operational insights and decision-making."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.forrester.com/report/Topic+Overview+Business+Intelligence/-/E-RES39218 |title=Topic Overview: Business Intelligence |last=Evelson |first=Boris |date=21 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under this definition, business intelligence encompasses [[information management]] ([[data integration]], [[data quality]], data warehousing, master-data management, text- and content-analytics, et al.). Therefore, Forrester refers to ''data preparation'' and ''data usage'' as two separate but closely linked segments of the business-intelligence architectural stack.

Some elements of business intelligence are:{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

* Multidimensional [[Aggregate (data warehouse)|aggregation]] and allocation
* [[Denormalization]], tagging, and standardization
* Realtime reporting with analytical alert
* A method of interfacing with [[unstructured data]] sources
* Group consolidation, budgeting and [[rolling forecast]]s
* [[Statistical inference]] and probabilistic simulation
* [[Key performance indicator]]s optimization
* Version control and process management
* Open item management

Forrester distinguishes this from the ''business-intelligence market'', which is "just the top layers of the BI architectural stack, such as [[Data reporting|reporting]], [[analytics]], and [[Dashboards (management information systems)|dashboards]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://blogs.forrester.com/boris_evelson/10-04-29-want_know_what_forresters_lead_data_analysts_are_thinking_about_bi_and_data_domain
|title=Want to know what Forrester's lead data analysts are thinking about BI and the data domain? |last=Evelson |first=Boris |date=29 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Compared with competitive intelligence===
Though the term business intelligence is sometimes a synonym for [[competitive intelligence]] (because they both support [[decision making]]), BI uses technologies, processes, and applications to analyze mostly internal, structured data and business processes while competitive intelligence gathers, analyzes and disseminates information with a topical focus on company competitors. If understood broadly, business intelligence can include the subset of competitive intelligence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blogs.forrester.com/james_kobielus/10-04-30-what%E2%80%99s_not_bi_oh_don%E2%80%99t_get_me_startedoops_too_latehere_goes |title=What’s Not BI? Oh, Don’t Get Me Started....Oops Too Late...Here Goes.... |last=Kobielus |first=James |date=30 April 2010 |quote=“Business” intelligence is a non-domain-specific catchall for all the types of analytic data that can be delivered to users in reports, dashboards, and the like. When you specify the subject domain for this intelligence, then you can refer to “competitive intelligence,” “market intelligence,” “social intelligence,” “financial intelligence,” “HR intelligence,” “supply chain intelligence,” and the like.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Compared with business analytics===
Business intelligence and [[business analytics]] are sometimes used interchangeably, but there are alternate definitions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://timoelliott.com/blog/2011/03/business-analytics-vs-business-intelligence.html |title=Business Analytics vs Business Intelligence? |publisher=timoelliott.com |date=2011-03-09 |accessdate=2014-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas H. Davenport|Thomas Davenport]], professor of information technology and management at [[Babson College]] argues that business intelligence should be divided into [[Information retrieval|querying]], [[Business reporting|reporting]], [[Online analytical processing]] (OLAP), an "alerts" tool, and business analytics. In this definition, business analytics is the subset of BI focusing on statistics, prediction, and optimization, rather than the reporting functionality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite interview |url=http://www.informationweek.com/news/software/bi/222200096 |title=Analytics at Work: Q&amp;A with Tom Davenport |last=Henschen |first=Doug |date=4 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Components of the BI landscape==
The Business Intelligence landscape reflects the complex system which data goes through in order to get processed into information. One of the first steps of starting a BI program, is to understand all components of this landscape. The particularities of this system tend to differ based on the industry and organization, but at a macro level, all BI landscapes have the same format. It’s usually composed of five pillars and five foundation blocks&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.lightsondata.com/business-intelligence-landscape-components/|title=10 components of the Business Intelligence landscape - LightsOnData|date=2018-07-04|work=LightsOnData|access-date=2018-11-12|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;:

The five pillars:

# Data source(s)
# Data integration
# Data management
# Reports 
# Information dissemination

The five foundation blocks:

# Information security
# Data quality
# Metadata management
# Data governance
# People &amp; culture

==Data==
Business operations can generate a very large amount of information in the form of e-mails, memos, notes from call-centers, news, user groups, chats, reports, web-pages, presentations, image-files, video-files, and marketing material. According to [[Merrill Lynch]], more than 85% of all business information exists in these forms; a company might only use such a document a single time.&lt;ref name = rao&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1109/MITP.2003.1254966 |url=http://www.ramanarao.com/papers/rao-itpro-2003-11.pdf|title=From unstructured data to actionable intelligence|year=2003|last1=Rao|first1=R.|journal=IT Professional|volume=5|issue=6|pages=29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the way it is produced and stored, this information is either [[Unstructured data|unstructured]] or [[semi-structured data|semi-structured]].

The management of semi-structured data is an unsolved problem in the information technology industry.&lt;ref name=blumberg&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://soquelgroup.com/Articles/dmreview_0203_problem.pdf|author1=Blumberg, R.|author2=S. Atre|lastauthoramp=yes|title=The Problem with Unstructured Data|journal=DM Review|year=2003|pages=42–46|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110125033210/http://soquelgroup.com/Articles/dmreview_0203_problem.pdf|archivedate=25 January 2011|deadurl=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to projections from Gartner (2003), white collar workers spend 30–40% of their time searching, finding, and assessing unstructured data. BI uses both structured and unstructured data. The former is easy to search, and the latter contains a large quantity of the information needed for analysis and decision making.&lt;ref name = blumberg /&gt;&lt;ref name = negash&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://site.xavier.edu/sena/info600/businessintelligence.pdf|author=Negash, S |title=Business Intelligence|journal= Communications of the Association of Information Systems|volume=13|year= 2004|pages=177–195}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the difficulty of properly searching, finding and assessing unstructured or semi-structured data, organizations may not draw upon these vast reservoirs of information, which could influence a particular decision, task or project. This can ultimately lead to poorly informed decision making.&lt;ref name = rao /&gt;

Therefore, when designing a business intelligence/DW-solution, the specific problems associated with semi-structured and unstructured data must be accommodated for as well as those for the structured data.&lt;ref name = negash /&gt;

===Unstructured data vs. semi-structured data===
Unstructured and semi-structured data have different meanings depending on their context. In the context of relational database systems, unstructured data cannot be stored in predictably ordered [[columns]] and [[Row (database)|rows]]. One type of unstructured data is typically stored in a [[BLOB]] (binary large object), a catch-all data type available in most [[relational database]] management systems. Unstructured data may also refer to irregularly or randomly repeated (nonrepetitive) column patterns that vary from row to row within each file or document.&lt;ref name="InmonUntang14"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ibmbigdatahub.com/blog/untangling-definition-unstructured-data |title=Untangling the Definition of Unstructured Data |author=Inmon, W.H. |work=Big Data &amp; Analytics Hub |publisher=IBM |date=25 July 2014 |accessdate=8 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of these data types, however, like e-mails, word processing text files, PPTs, image-files, and video-files conform to a standard that offers the possibility of metadata. Metadata can include information such as author and time of creation, and this can be stored in a relational database.
Therefore, it may be more accurate to talk about this as semi-structured documents or data,&lt;ref name = blumberg /&gt; but no specific consensus seems to have been reached.

Unstructured data can also simply be the knowledge that business users have about future business trends. Business forecasting naturally aligns with the BI system because business users think of their business in aggregate terms. Capturing the business knowledge that may only exist in the minds of business users provides some of the most important data points for a complete BI solution.

===Limitations of semi-structured and unstructured data===
There are several challenges to developing BI with semi-structured data. According to Inmon &amp; Nesavich,&lt;ref name = inmon&gt;Inmon, B. &amp; A. Nesavich, "Unstructured Textual Data in the Organization" from "Managing Unstructured data in the organization", Prentice Hall 2008, pp. 1–13&lt;/ref&gt; some of those are:

* Physically accessing unstructured textual data&amp;nbsp;– unstructured data is stored in a huge variety of formats.
* [[Terminology]]&amp;nbsp;– Among researchers and analysts, there is a need to develop a standardized terminology.
* Volume of data&amp;nbsp;– As stated earlier, up to 85% of all data exists as semi-structured data. Couple that with the need for word-to-word and semantic analysis.
* Searchability of unstructured textual data&amp;nbsp;– A simple search on some data, e.g. apple, results in links where there is a reference to that precise search term. (Inmon &amp; Nesavich, 2008)&lt;ref name = inmon /&gt; gives an example: “a search is made on the term felony. In a simple search, the term felony is used, and everywhere there is a reference to felony, a hit to an unstructured document is made. But a simple search is crude. It does not find references to crime, arson, murder, embezzlement, vehicular homicide, and such, even though these crimes are types of felonies.”

===Metadata===
To solve problems with searchability and assessment of data, it is necessary to know something about the content. This can be done by adding context through the use of [[metadata]].&lt;ref name = rao /&gt; Many systems already capture some metadata (e.g. filename, author, size, etc.), but more useful would be metadata about the actual content&amp;nbsp;– e.g. summaries, topics, people or companies mentioned. Two technologies designed for generating metadata about content are automatic categorization and [[information extraction]].

==Applications==
Business intelligence can be applied to the following business purposes:&lt;ref name="FeldmanDeveloping13"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xDXfeopC-kMC&amp;pg=PA140 |title=Developing Business Intelligence Apps for SharePoint |author=Feldman, D.; Himmelstein, J. |publisher=O'Reilly Media, Inc |pages=140–1 |year=2013 |isbn=9781449324681 |accessdate=8 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Performance metrics]] and [[benchmarking]] inform business leaders of progress towards business goals ([[business process management]]).
* [[Analytics]] quantify processes for a business to arrive at optimal decisions, and to perform business knowledge discovery. Analytics may variously involve [[data mining]], [[process mining]], [[statistical analysis]], [[predictive analytics]], [[predictive modeling]], [[business process modeling]], [[data lineage]], [[complex event processing]] and [[prescriptive analytics]].
* [[Business reporting]] can use BI data to inform strategy. Business reporting may involve [[data visualization]], [[executive information system]], and/or [[OLAP]]
* BI can facilitate [[collaboration]] both inside and outside the business by enabling [[data sharing]] and [[electronic data interchange]]
* [[Knowledge management]] is concerned with the creation, distribution, use, and management of business intelligence, and of business knowledge in general. Knowledge management leads to [[learning management]] and [[regulatory compliance]].

==Marketplace==
In a 2013 report, Gartner categorized business intelligence vendors as either an independent "pure-play" vendor or a consolidated "megavendor".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.zdnet.com/gartner-releases-2013-bi-magic-quadrant-7000011264/ |title=Gartner releases 2013 BI Magic Quadrant |publisher=ZDNet |author=Andrew Brust| date= 2013-02-14|accessdate=21 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bi-verdict.com/fileadmin/FreeAnalyses/consolidations.htm |title=Consolidations in the BI industry |date=7 March 2008 |last=Pendse |first=Nigel |work=The OLAP Report}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012 business intelligence services received $13.1 billion in revenue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gartner Says Worldwide Business Intelligence, CPM and Analytic Applications/Performance Management Software Market Grew Seven Percent in 2012 |url=http://www.gartner.com/newsroom/id/2507915 |website=Gartner.com |accessdate=11 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Historical predictions===
A 2009 paper predicted&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gartner.com/it/page.jsp?id=856714 Gartner Reveals Five Business Intelligence Predictions for 2009 and Beyond]. gartner.com. 15 January 2009&lt;/ref&gt; these developments in the business intelligence market:

* Because of lack of information, processes, and tools, through 2012, more than 35 percent of the top 5,000 global companies regularly fail to make insightful decisions about significant changes in their business and markets.
* By 2012, business units will control at least 40 percent of the total budget for business intelligence.
* By 2012, one-third of analytic applications applied to business processes will be delivered through [[Granularity|coarse-grained]] application [[mashup (web application hybrid)|mashups]].

A 2009 ''Information Management'' special report predicted the top BI trends: "[[green computing]], [[social networking service]]s, [[data visualization]], [[Mobile business intelligence|mobile BI]], [[predictive analytics]], [[composite application]]s, [[cloud computing]] and [[Multi-touch|multitouch]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.information-management.com/specialreports/2009_148/business_intelligence_data_vizualization_social_networking_analytics-10015628-1.html |title=10 Red Hot BI Trends |last=Campbell |first=Don |date=23 June 2009 |work=Information Management}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research undertaken in 2014 indicated that employees are more likely to have access to, and more likely to engage with, cloud-based BI tools than traditional tools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aberdeen.com/Aberdeen-Library/8906/RR-analytics-cloud-saas-bi.aspx |title=Cloud Analytics in 2014: Infusing the Workforce with Insight |last=Lock|first=Michael|date=27 March 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other business intelligence trends include the following:
* Third party SOA-BI products increasingly address [[Extract, transform, load|ETL]] issues of volume and throughput.
* Companies embrace in-memory processing, 64-bit processing, and pre-packaged analytic BI applications.
* Operational applications have callable BI components, with improvements in response time, scaling, and concurrency.
* Near or real time BI analytics is a baseline expectation.
* Open source BI software replaces vendor offerings.

Other lines of research include the combined study of business intelligence and uncertain data.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

According to a study by the Aberdeen Group, there has been increasing interest in [[Software-as-a-Service]] (SaaS) business intelligence over the past years, with twice as many organizations using this deployment approach as one year ago&amp;nbsp;– 15% in 2009 compared to 7% in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Julian|first1=Taylor|title=Business intelligence implementation according to customer's needs|url=http://apro-software.com/services/software-development/business-intelligence|publisher=APRO Software|accessdate=16 May 2016|date=10 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An article by InfoWorld's Chris Kanaracus points out similar growth data from research firm IDC, which predicts the SaaS BI market will grow 22 percent each year through 2013 thanks to increased product sophistication, strained IT budgets, and other factors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://infoworld.com/d/cloud-computing/saas-bi-growth-will-soar-in-2010-511 SaaS BI growth will soar in 2010 | Cloud Computing].

'''CISBOT''' ('''cast-iron sealing robot''') is a [[cast iron pipe]]-repair robot that seals the joints in [[natural gas]] pipelines from the inside, thus extending their use for up to fifty years without unearthing the joints.{{r|nap1}} 

==Background==
Many cast-iron pipes installed over a century ago have joints of [[jute]] sealed with [[lead]] that deteriorate over time and are often the causes of cast-iron pipe failure.{{r|enr1}} Jute was an effective joint sealant when the pipes carried coal-based [[town gas]], but natural gas, used since the 1950s in New York{{r|nyt1}} and the 1970s in the UK,{{r|ibt1}} dries out the jute. A fifty-year life expectancy of the new seal has been proven in studies by [[Cornell University]].{{r|nap1}}

==Description==
CISBOT is {{convert|12|in}} in diameter, is {{convert|35|in}} long, weighs {{convert|85|lb}}, and is deployed with a truck containing the control unit, which is attached to the robot with a tether for the power, communication, and control cables, as well as sealant tubing.  It is capable of repairing {{convert|16-36|in|cm|adj=mid|-diameter}} pipe.{{r|enr1}}

CISBOT is introduced into a pipeline through a {{convert|5x5|ft|adj=on}} hole and can repair the joints with an [[anaerobic sealant]] for a distance of {{convert|1500|ft}} while the pipe is still in operation. External repair without the robot would require the arranging of temporary gas supply to customers through tanks, purging the pipeline of gas, then digging up each joint, usually every {{convert|12|feet}}, repairing the joint, and re-covering the pipeline.{{r|nyt1}} The cost of internal robotic repair is approximately 25% of manual resealing and 10% of total pipeline replacement.{{r|enr1}}

The robot was developed by [[ULC Robotics]] of [[Hauppauge, New York|Hauppauge]], [[New York (state)|New York]] with cooperation from [[Con Edison]] and [[National Grid plc|National Grid]] and costs approximately $1&amp;nbsp;million.{{r|enr1}} ULC announced the robot in 2015;{{r|CIO1}} however it has been in use since at least 2010{{r|rg1}} and by mid-2012 had sealed over 5000 joints.{{r|ndt1}}

CISBOT has been used in the United States in [[Manhattan]], [[Brooklyn]], [[Staten Island]], [[Rhode Island]], and [[Boston]]. In Europe, it has been used in [[London]] and [[Glasgow]] by [[SGN (company)|SGN]].{{r|nap1|enr1}}

==Operation==
A flange is first attached to the pipe, through which CISBOT drills an access hole. It then rolls into the pipe and propels itself on two wheels down the pipe. It can travel up to {{convert|17|ft}} per minute.{{r|nyt1}} Upon reaching a joint, it rotates 360° within the pipe to apply the sealant, using its third perpendicular wheel. It drills holes into the joints through which it injects the sealant.{{r|nyt1}} It is controlled by two operators monitoring through six cameras.{{r|enr1}} It is equipped with lights and other sensors.{{r|nyt1}}

In [[New York City]], CISBOT has discovered foreign objects within gas pipelines, including a baseball and stiletto shoes. It found a 1939 newspaper under Boston's [[Berkeley Street Historic District|Berkeley Street]].{{r|nyt1}}

In 2015 CISBOT received a "game changer" award from [[Robotics Business Review]] because of its significant improvement in the process used to fix pipe joints.{{r|nyt1}}

A. |title=Gardner's commercially important chemicals: synonyms, trade names, and properties |publisher=Wiley-Interscience |location=New York |year=2005 |pages=568 |isbn=0-471-73518-3 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; are a [[sulfur]]-based product that is used primarily to sterilize [[Winemaking|wine]], [[cider]] and in [[Brewing|beer making]] to kill [[bacteria]] and to inhibit the growth of most [[yeast (wine)|wild yeast]]: this product is also used to eliminate both free [[chlorine]] and the more stable form, [[chloramine]], from water solutions (e.g., drinking water from municipal sources). Campden tablets allow the amateur brewer to easily measure small quantities of sodium metabisulfite, so it can be used to protect against wild yeast and bacteria without affecting flavour. Untreated cider [[must]] frequently suffers from acetobacter contamination causing vinegar spoilage. Yeast are resistant to the tablets but the acetobacter are easily killed off, hence treatment is important in cider production.

Typical use is one crushed Campden tablet per US gallon (3.8 L) of [[must]] or [[wort (brewing)|wort]].  This dosage contributes 67 ppm [[sulfur dioxide]] to the wort but the level of active sulfur dioxide diminishes rapidly as it reacts with chlorine and chloramine, and with [[aldehydes]] (particularly in wine).  Therefore, the concentration of free sulfur dioxide is greatly diminished by the time the beer or wine is consumed.  However, when used only for the purpose of dechlorinating tap water before brewing, one tablet will effectively treat 20 US gallons (75 L) of water.&lt;ref&gt;[[John J. Palmer|Palmer, John.]] [http://www.howtobrew.com/section1/chapter4-1.html "Home Water Treatment"], Retrieved on 2009-06-04.&lt;/ref&gt;

Campden tablets are also used as an anti-oxidizing agent when transferring wine between containers.  The sodium metabisulfite in the Campden tablets will trap oxygen that enters the wine, preventing it from doing any harm.

It is a common misconception that Campden tablets can be used to halt the ferment process in wine before all the available sugars are converted by the yeast, hence controlling the amount of residual sweetness in the final product.  This however is not true.  In order to halt fermentation, enough Campden tablets would have to be added to render the wine undrinkable.  Alternatively, when used in conjunction with [[potassium sorbate]], the yeast population will be greatly reduced and prevented from reproducing. Without the addition of [[potassium sorbate]] the yeast population will only be stunned and eventually repopulate if provided with enough fermentable sugars.&lt;ref&gt;[[E.C. Kraus]] [http://www.eckraus.com/wine-making-stop-fermentation "How To Stop A Fermentation"], Retrieved on 2012-11-21.&lt;/ref&gt;

Campden tablets typically contain 0.44 g each of sodium metabisulfite (plus filler) and 10 of these are equivalent to one level teaspoon (5 mL) of sodium metabisulfite. Other related substances are sodium/potassium sulfite/bisulfite. Further complicating the subject, each is also referred to interchangeably as—sulfites, and the 'bi' can be found as 'di'. In terms of usage, sodium [[thiosulfate]] is a closely related compound.

The name Campden tablet comes from the town of [[Chipping Campden]] in [[Gloucestershire]], England, where the original solution was developed in the 1920s by the Fruit and Vegetable Preserving Research Station - now [[Brewing Industry Research Foundation|Campden BRI]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lea|first=Andrew|title=Origin of the Campden Tablet|url=http://cider.org.uk/campden.html|accessdate=31 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea was then taken up by [[Boots UK|the Boots Co.]], who developed the tablet.

Campden tablets are also useful in decontamination and neutralization after exposure to [[tear gas]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

The [[molar mass]] (commonly called molecular weight or MW) of potassium metabisulfite is 222 g/mol, while the molecular weight of sodium metabisulfite is 190 g/mol.

== Health Effects ==
Some people have allergies or intolerance to [[Sulfite#Health_effects|sulfites]]. Allergies are less common than intolerance, but in rare cases may cause life-threatening anaphylactic reaction. Products containing residual amounts of sulfites, including potassium metabisulfite and sodium metabisulfite, should be labelled.

{{about|the computer architecture|the biological concept|Structural biology}}

A '''cellular architecture''' is a type of [[computer architecture]] prominent in [[parallel computing]]. Cellular architectures are relatively new, with [[IBM]]'s [[Cell microprocessor]] being the first one to reach the market. Cellular architecture takes [[Multi-core (computing)|multi-core architecture]] design to its logical conclusion, by giving the programmer the ability to run large numbers of concurrent threads within a single processor. Each 'cell' is a compute node containing thread units, memory, and communication. Speed-up is achieved by exploiting [[thread-level parallelism]] inherent in many applications.

Cell, a cellular architecture containing 9 cores, is the processor used in the [[PlayStation 3]]. Another prominent cellular architecture is [[Cyclops64]], a massively parallel architecture currently under development by IBM.  

Cellular architectures follow the [[low-level programming]] paradigm, which exposes the programmer to much of the underlying hardware. This allows the programmer to greatly optimize their code for the platform, but at the same time makes it more difficult to [[software development|develop software]].

'''''Code of the Lifemaker''''' is a 1983 novel by British [[science fiction]] [[author]] [[James P. Hogan (writer)|James P. Hogan]].  [[NASA]]'s [https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19830007077.pdf Advanced Automation for Space Missions] was the direct inspiration for this novel detailing [[First contact (science fiction)|first contact]] between [[Earth]] explorers and the Taloids, [[clanking replicator]]s who have [[colonization|colonized]] [[Saturn]]'s moon [[Titan (moon)|Titan]].

A sequel titled ''[[The Immortality Option]]'' was published in 1995.

==Plot summary==

About 1,000,000 B.C., an unidentified alien race sent out robotic factories to many worlds in their part of the galaxy to prepare for future settlement.  One of those factory ships suffers severe  radiation damage from a near-miss by a [[supernova]] and goes off course, drifting in space for a hundred thousand years before landing on the Saturnian moon Titan. Due to a malfunction in its database, it begins producing imperfect copies that begin to [[evolution|evolve]] on their own. (The description of this background is presented in a prologue&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.baen.com/chapters/W200203/0743435265___0.htm| title=Prologue: The Searcher| work=Code of the Lifemaker| publisher=Baen| accessdate=2006-08-01| year=1983}}&lt;/ref&gt; that proved sufficiently popular among readers that it was later anthologized on its own in a collection of Hogan's short fiction.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| first=James P.| last= Hogan| title=Minds, Machines &amp; Evolution| publisher=Baen| year=1988}}&lt;/ref&gt; The resulting machine ecosystem eventually gives rise to humanoid robots with human-like intellects, who develop a civilization similar to early civilization of Earth. Almost all of them have reverence for their mythical creator, a being they call the "Lifemaker".

Early in the 21st century, the North Atlantic Space Organization (combining NASA and [[NATO]]) dispatched the ''Orion'' with a cover story of [[terraforming]] [[Mars]] for human habitation.  Karl Zambendorf, a [[con artist]] who is present on this expedition to verify [[Extra-sensory perception|ESP]] over interplanetary distances, prematurely learns that the ''Orion'' and its crew of researchers is headed for Titan, where the discovery of the Taloids has been kept need-to-know on Earth.

When the ''Orion'' arrives, the first landing party sets down in a freethinking state where Thirg, a Taloid who was cast out of his home state Kroaxia, has fled. They are mistaken for the Lifemaker because they have come from the sky, which the Taloids cannot see out of due to Titan's atmosphere. But Thirg becomes more discerning as he and the humans begin to understand more of each other's speech. Thirg's brother Groork has come from Kroaxia to apprehend him, but Zambendorf intercepts him and sends him back to Kroaxia as a [[prophet]].

Zambendorf learned that NASO plans to exploit Titan's natural resources and use the Taloids to build the factories they need, reducing them to [[slavery|slaves]]. The NASO business administrators on the ''Orion'' are already in agreement with the Kroaxian government to use human (the Taloids call humans "Lumians" because they glow brightly in their infrared vision) weapons to conquer Titan, believing the Kroaxian leadership buttressed by priests will be the easiest to control. Zambendorf, in his unanticipated role as Messenger for the Lifemaker, has given Groork guidelines akin to the [[Ten Commandments]] for his people to prevent a war from starting. "All Taloids are brothers" and "No Taloid is to enslave or be a slave" does not sit well with the ruling establishment of Kroaxia, and Groork is saved by the ''Orion'' crew not working for NASO.  There will be use of Titan's resources, but the partnership between humans and Taloids will be one of equals.

'''Colour recovery''' (or '''colour restoration''') is a process which can restore lost colour, specifically to television programmes which were originally transmitted from colour video tape, but for which only [[black &amp; white]] copies remain archived.&lt;ref name="techmind1"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.techmind.org/colrec/|title=PAL Colour Recovery from black-and-white 'telerecordings'|date=2008-05-08|accessdate=2009-05-18|publisher=William Andrew Steer, techmind.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not to be confused with [[Film colorization|colourisation]], colour recovery is a newer process&lt;ref name="guardian_dw" /&gt; and is fundamentally different from colourisation for several reasons.&lt;ref name="guardian_dw" /&gt; Firstly, colour recovery can only be performed if the originally transmitted colour signal can be reconstructed or recovered from some source, whereas this is not usually the case for traditional colourisation. Secondly, colourisation can be used to colourise films and programmes that were made in black and white, using still colour photos and/or some educated guesswork to manually choose a colour palette.  Conversely, the goal of colour recovery is to reinstate (as closely as possible) the colour signals of programmes originally made in colour as they were first seen. Colour recovery reconstructs the colour information from actual recovered signals and theoretically without depending on guesswork. As of 2018, colour recovery has successfully been applied to episodes of the BBC TV programmes ''[[Doctor Who]]'',&lt;ref name="guardian_dw"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2008/mar/06/research.bbc|title=Putting colour back in the Doctor's cheeks|date=2008-03-06|accessdate=2009-05-18|publisher=The Guardian | location=London | first=Charles | last=Norton}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Dad's Army]]'',&lt;ref name="guardian_da"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2008/dec/11/digital-video-restoration-dad-s-army|title=Unscrambling an army of colours|date=2008-12-11|accessdate=2008-05-18|publisher=The Guardian | location=London | first=Charles | last=Norton}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Are You Being Served?]]''.

==Background==
{{Further|Wiping|Telerecording}}

Due to the well-documented practice of [[wiping]], many original videotape recordings of colour programmes were lost. However, in the case of the [[BBC]], many [[telerecording|telerecorded]] black &amp; white film copies of affected programmes survived. These black &amp; white copies were made for overseas commercial exploitation of BBC programmes. For a variety of technical and practical reasons (for example various incompatible international TV standards, and the then-high cost of videotape over that of film&lt;ref name="dwrt1" /&gt;), black &amp; white film copies were the preferred medium for selling programmes overseas.&lt;ref name="625_1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.625.org.uk/pre1963/pre1963.htm|title=BRITISH TELEFANTASY BEGAN IN 1963.... PART 1 |accessdate=2009-05-18|publisher=Nick Cooper}}&lt;/ref&gt; This practice ultimately led to many programmes which were originally made and transmitted in colour only existing in black and white form after the practice of wiping finally ceased.

==Methods of colour recovery==

===From off-air recordings===

{{Further|The Dæmons}}

During the 1970s, various off-air [[NTSC]] video-recordings were made by American and Canadian ''Doctor Who'' fans, which were later returned to the BBC.&lt;ref name="dwrt1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.purpleville.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/rtwebsite/colouris.htm |title=Pertwee Colour Restorations |accessdate=2009-05-18 |publisher=Steve Roberts, The Doctor Who restoration team website |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081207015923/http://www.purpleville.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/rtwebsite/colouris.htm |archivedate=2008-12-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="int1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.michaeldvd.com.au/articles/interviews/drwhorestorationteam.html|title=A quick interview with Steve Roberts|accessdate=2009-05-18|publisher=Dean McIntosh}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="whoniversity1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.whoniversity.co.uk/quick/s8.htm|title=Season Eight|date=1997-09-02|accessdate=2009-05-18|publisher=Robert D. Franks}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whilst the quality of these early domestic video recordings was not suitable for broadcast, the lower-definition [[chrominance]] signal could be retrieved from them. This signal could be successfully combined with the [[Luma (video)|luminance]] signal from digitally-scanned existing broadcast-quality monochrome telerecordings to make new colour master copies, suitable for broadcast and sales. In the 1990s this method was carried out by the [[Doctor Who Restoration Team]].&lt;ref name="dwrt1" /&gt; Several colour ''Doctor Who'' serials were subsequently released on [[VHS]].&lt;ref name="dwrt1" /&gt; Combining the video-recorded colour signals with the monochrome telerecordings is a non-trivial task, requiring digital processing (for example matching up the different screen sizes of the two recordings).&lt;ref name="dwrt1" /&gt; Thus, it wasn't until the early 1990s that cheaply available, sufficiently powerful computer hardware and software made this task particularly practical at that time.&lt;ref name="dwrt1" /&gt;

===From ''chroma crawl''===
{{Further|Luma (video)|Chrominance|Dot crawl|PAL|Color burst|Subcarrier}}
Black &amp; white TV systems predate colour, and so subsequent analogue colour broadcast systems have been designed with backwards-compatibility in mind (known as a ''compatible colour'' system).&lt;ref name="brit1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1262241/television-technology/235338/Compatible-colour-television|title=Compatible color television|accessdate=2009-05-18|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the chrominance (colour) signal is typically 'shoe-horned' into the same channel as the luminance (brightness) signal, [[modulation|modulated]] on a fixed frequency, known as the ''colour subcarrier''. Black and white televisions do not decode this extra colour information in the [[subcarrier]], using only the luminance to provide a monochrome picture. However, due to limited bandwidth in the video channel, the chrominance and luminance signals bleed into each other considerably, resulting in the colour information showing up visibly as [[Dot crawl|Chroma Crawl]], or [[Chroma dots]] on black &amp; white TV sets.&lt;ref name="techmind1" /&gt; This is normally considered a nuisance in analogue broadcasting.&lt;ref name="vg1"&gt;{{cite web|url= https://computing.llnl.gov/vis/guidelines.shtml|title=
12 Point Video Tape Quality Guidelines
|date=2007-11-28|accessdate=2009-05-18|publisher=The IMG group at the Livermore National Laboratory}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, since telerecordings were made from black &amp; white TV screens and technicians at the time often decided not to apply a filter to remove this interference,&lt;ref name="guardian_dw" /&gt; these patterns are retained even in the existing monochrome film prints and theoretically contain the original colour information.  (Occasionally the colour information was filtered out using a [[notch filter]] and is lost.)  The idea to recover this information was originally suggested by BBC researcher [[James Insell]].&lt;ref name="guardian_dw" /&gt;

In practice however, the recovery of this colour information from telerecordings is highly complex for several reasons. Firstly, the colour reference timing signal, known as the ''[[colour burst]],'' is absent from telerecordings, as it is nominally off the edge of the visible screen area being recorded. This timing has to effectively be recovered since the ''phase'' of the chroma dots, which is represented by their horizontal position on the screen, determines the hue of the reconstructed colours.&lt;ref name="crwg2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://colour-recovery.wikispaces.com/Towards+full-gamut|title=Towards full-gamut|date=2008-05-05|accessdate=2009-05-18|first=Andrew|last=Steer|publisher=Colour Recovery Working Group|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081021085106/http://colour-recovery.wikispaces.com:80/Towards+full-gamut|archive-date=2008-10-21|dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Distortions in the geometry of the telerecordings due to the nature of physically recording from a non-flat CRT screen onto film means that a transformation has to be applied in order to infer the original positions of the chroma dots within the broadcast.

However, these technical obstacles were finally overcome in 2008, and software written by developer [[Richard T. Russell|Richard Russell]] at the informal ''[[Colour Recovery Working Group]]''&lt;ref name="crwg1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://colour-recovery.wikispaces.com/|title=Colour Recovery Working Group|date=2007-03-06|accessdate=2009-06-18|publisher=James Insell, Colour Recovery Working Group|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090701001533/http://colour-recovery.wikispaces.com:80/|archive-date=2009-07-01|dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; was put to use, finally resulting in the broadcast and release of colour-recovered episodes of ''Dad's Army'' and ''Doctor Who''.&lt;ref name="guardian_da" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3087">'''Design controls''' designates the application of a formal [[Design management|methodology]] to the conduct of [[new product development|product development]] activities.
It is often mandatory (by regulation) to implement such practice when designing and developing products within regulated industries (e.g. [[medical devices]]).

== Medical devices ==

Since 1990, the [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) has required that [[medical device]] manufacturers that want to market certain categories of medical devices in the USA follow Design Control requirements (21 CFR 820.30). At a high level, this regulation requires:
* [[Design and development planning]]
* [[Design input]], including intended use and [[Voice of the customer|user needs]] (also known as customer attributes)
* [[Design output]], including evaluation of conformance to design input requirements through:
** Design verification confirming that the design output meets the design input requirements ("did we design the device right?")
** Design validation ensuring that the devices conform to defined user needs and intended uses ("did we design the right device?")
* [[Design review]]
* [[Design transfer]] ensuring that the device design is correctly translated into production specifications
* [[Design change|Design changes]]
* [[Design history file]], a demonstration that the design was developed according to the approved design plan and 21 CFR 820.30.

The [[Medical Devices Directive]] (MDD 93/42/EEC) similarly lists several requirements regarding the design of a medical device.
'''[[ISO 13485]]''' is a voluntary standard that contains section 7.3 Design and Development recommending which procedures should be put in place by manufacturers in order to have a quality system that will comply with MDD 93/42/EEC.

The objective of Design Controls, in this context, is to require that manufacturers follow a methodologically-sound process to develop a medical device, with the intent of improving the probability that the device will reach an acceptable level of [[efficacy]] and safety.

'''A designer''' is a person who makes [[design]]s for objects. A [[fashion designer]] designs clothing, a [[web designer]] designs web pages, and an [[automobile design]]er designs automobiles. In each case, the designer works with the help of a technician or [[engineer]] who understands deeper level concepts of [[manufacturing]] and engineering, and the designer themself is largely confined to work at a surface level.   

More formally, a designer is an [[Agency (philosophy)|agent]] that "specifies the structural properties of a design [[Object (philosophy)|object]]".&lt;ref&gt;Ralph, P. and Wand, Y. (2009). A proposal for a formal definition of the design concept. In Lyytinen, K., Loucopoulos, P., [[John Mylopoulos|Mylopoulos, J.]], and Robinson, W., editors, Design Requirements Workshop (LNBIP 14), pp. 103–136. Springer-Verlag, p. 110&lt;/ref&gt; In practice, anyone who creates tangible or intangible objects, products, processes, laws, games, graphics, services, and experiences is referred to as a designer.

==Overview==
Classically, the main area of design was only [[architecture]], which was understood as the major arts. The design of [[clothing]], [[furniture]], and other common artifacts were left mostly to tradition or artisans specializing in hand making them.

Design is a part of the [[Visual communication|communication arts]], [[design]] is something you plan to create, it communicates to the viewer or user a visual and emotional message to change or guide  through an emotional connection with a product or service enhancing their experience of the product or [[brand]]

With the increasing complexity in [[industrial design]] of today’s society, and due to the needs of [[mass production]] where more time is usually associated with more cost, the production methods became more complex and with them, the way designs and their production is created. The classical areas are now subdivided into smaller and more specialized domains of design (landscape design, urban design, exterior design, interior design, industrial design, furniture design, cloth design, and much more) according to the product designed or perhaps its means of production. Despite the variety of specializations within the design industry, all of them are very closely connected in terms of the need of professionals having a eye for design and being inspired by each other.

When designers speak of [[graphic design]] they speak of it in terms of simplifying complexity so users do not feel overwhelmed when faced with complex systems. More information can lead to a better, simpler solution to whatever problem the designer is trying to solve. Using [[research methodology]] to solve problems is one of the most important aspects of design, it enables the designer to properly assess the clients and audience needs. Part of a designer's job is to get to know the audience they intend on canvassing and what will be the placement of any produced material created.

The education, experience, and genetic blocks that form the base of a competent designer is normally similar no matter the area of specialization, only in a later stages of training and work will designer diverge to a specialized field. The methods of teaching or the program and theories followed vary according to schools and field of study.
Today, a design team, no matter the scale of the equipment, is usually composed by a master designer (the head of the team) that will have the responsibility to take decisions about the way the creative process should evolve, and a number of technical designers (the hands of the team) specialized in diverse areas according to the product proposed, depending on the type of design [[industrial design]] vs [[graphic design]] for example. For more complex products, the team will also be composed of professionals from other areas like engineers, advertising specialists, and others as required.
The relationships established between team members will vary according to proposed product, the processes of production, the equipment available, or the theories followed during the idea development, but normally they are not too restrictive, giving an opportunity to everyone in the team to take a part in the creation process or at least to express an idea.

'''Distributed GIS''' refers to [[GIS|GI Systems]] that do not have all of the system components in the same physical location.  This could be the [[Process (computing)|processing]], the [[database]], the rendering or the [[user interface]].  Examples of distributed systems are [[web-based]] GIS and [[Mobile GIS]].

== Etymology ==

The term Distributed GIS was coined by [[Bruce Gittings]] at the [[University of Edinburgh]]. He was responsible for one of the first [[Internet]]-based distributed GIS.  In 1994, he designed and implemented the World Wide Earthquake Locator, which provided maps of recent earthquake occurrences to a location-independent user, which used the [[Xerox PARC]] mapping system (based in [[California]], USA), managed by an interface based in [[Edinburgh (Scotland)]], which drew data in real-time from the [[National Earthquake Information Center]] (USGS) in [[Colorado]], USA.&lt;ref name="www.geo.ed.ac.uk"&gt;[http://www.geo.ed.ac.uk/quakes/]. The justification for the original Earthquake Locator, an experiment in distributed internetworking, World Wide Earthquake Locator&lt;/ref&gt;  Gittings first taught a course &lt;ref name="www.star.euclid.ed.ac.uk"&gt;The University of Edinburgh Course Catalogue {{cite web |url=http://www.star.euclid.ed.ac.uk/ipp/cxpgge11084.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-10-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111117165752/http://www.star.euclid.ed.ac.uk/ipp/cxpgge11084.htm |archivedate=2011-11-17 |df= }}. Distributed GIS Course&lt;/ref&gt; in this subject in 2005 as part of the Masters Programme in GIS at that institution. Since there was no Wikipedia article relating to Distributed GIS at the time, he set his students the task of creating one in 2007 as a class exercise.

==Types==
===Enterprise GIS===
[[Enterprise GIS]] refers to a geographical information system that integrates geographic data across multiple departments and serves the whole organisation.&lt;ref&gt;ESRI, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; The basic idea of an enterprise GIS is to deal with departmental needs collectively instead of individually. When organisations started using [[GIS]] in the 1960s and 1970s, the focus was on individual projects where individual users created and maintained data sets on their own desktop computers. Due to extensive interaction and work-flow between departments, many organisations have in recent years switched from independent, stand-alone GIS systems to more integrated approaches that share resources and applications.&lt;ref&gt;Ionita, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the potential benefits that an enterprise GIS can provide include significantly reduced redundancy of data across the system, improved accuracy and integrity of geographic information, and more efficient use and sharing of data.&lt;ref name="Sipes2005"&gt;Sipes, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Since data is one of the most significant investments in any GIS program, any approach that reduces acquisition costs while maintaining data quality is important. The implementation of an enterprise GIS may also reduce the overall GIS maintenance and support costs providing a more effective use of departmental GIS resources. Data can be integrated and used in decision making processes across the whole organisation.&lt;ref name="Sipes2005"/&gt;

=== Corporate GIS ===
A corporate [[Geographical Information System]], is similar to [[Enterprise GIS]] and satisfies the spatial information needs of an organisation as a whole in an integrated manner.&lt;ref&gt;Chan &amp; Williamson 1997&lt;/ref&gt; Corporate GIS consists of four technological elements which are [[data]], [[Technical standard|standards]], [[information technology]] and personnel with expertise. It is a coordinated approach that moves away from fragmented desktop GIS.  The design of a corporate GIS includes the construction of a centralised corporate [[database]] that is designed to be the principle resource for an entire organisation. The corporate database is specifically designed to efficiently and effectively suit the requirements of the organisation. Essential to a corporate GIS is the effective management of the corporate database and the establishment of standards such as [[Open Geospatial Consortium|OGC]] for mapping and database technologies.

Benefits include that all the users in the organisation have access to shared, complete, accurate, high quality and up-to-date data. All the users in the organisation also have access to shared technology and people with expertise. This improves the efficiency and effectiveness of the organisation as a whole. A successfully managed corporate database reduces redundant collection and storage of information across the organisation. By centralising resources and efforts, it reduces the overall cost.

===Mobile GIS===
With ~80% of all data deemed to have a spatial component, modern Mobile GIS are a powerful geo-centric business process integration platform enabling the Spatial Enterprise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://latlongo.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/LatLonGO-White-Paper.pdf|title=LatLonGO White Paper|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The number of mobile devices in circulation has surpassed the world’s population (2013) with a rapid acceleration in [[iOS]], [[Android (operating system)|Android]] and [[Windows 8]] tablet up-take.  
Tablets are fast becoming popular for Utility field use. Low-cost MIL-STD-810 certified cases transform consumer tablets into fully ruggedised, yet lightweight field use units at 10% of legacy ruggedised laptop costs.

Although not all applications of mobile GIS are limited by the device, many are. 
These limitations are more applicable to smaller devices such as [[cell phones]] and [[PDA]]s. 
Such devices have: small screens with a poor resolution, limited memory and processing power, a poor (or no) keyboard, and short battery life.
Additional limitations can be found in web client based tablet applications: poor web GUI and device integration, on-line reliance, and very limited off-line web client cache.

===Location-Based Services===
[[Location-based service]]s (LBS) are services that are distributed wirelessly and provide information relevant to the user’s current location. These services include such things as ‘find my nearest …’, directions, and various vehicle monitoring systems, such as the [[OnStar|GM OnStar system]] amongst others. Location-based services are generally run on mobile phones and PDAs, and are intended for use by the general public more than Mobile GIS systems which are geared towards commercial enterprise. Devices can be located by triangulation using the mobile phone network and/or GPS.

===Web Mapping Services===
A web mapping service is a means of displaying and interacting with maps on the Web. The first web mapping service was the [[Xerox PARC Map Viewer]] built in 1993 and decommissioned in 2000.

There have been 3 generations of [[web map service]]. The first generation was from 1993 onwards and consisted of simple [[image maps]] which had a single click function. The second generation was from 1996 onwards and still used [[image maps]] the one click function. However, they also had zoom and pan capabilities (although slow) and could be customised through the use of the [[URL]] [[API]]. The third generation was from 1998 onwards and were the first to include slippy maps.  They utilise [[Ajax (programming)|AJAX]] technology which enables seamless panning and zooming. They are customisable using the [[URL]] [[API]] and can have extended functionality programmed in using the [[Document Object Model|DOM]].

Web map services are based on the concept of the [[image map]] whereby this defines the area overlaying an image (e.g. GIF). An [[image map]] can be processed client or server side. As functionality is built into the web server, performance is good. [[Image maps]] can be dynamic. When [[image maps]] are used for geographic purposes, the co-ordinate system must be transformed to the geographical origin to conform to the geographical standard of having the origin at the bottom left corner.

Web maps are used for [[location-based service]]s.

=== Local search ===
{{main article|Local search (Internet)}}

Local Search is a recent approach to internet searching that incorporates geographical information into search queries so that the links that you return are more relevant to where you are. It developed out of an increasing awareness that many [[search engine]] users are using it to look for a business or service in the local area. Local search has stimulated the development of web mapping, which is used either as a tool to use in geographically restricting your search (see [[Live Search Maps]]) or as an additional resource to be returned along with search result listings (see [[Google Maps]]). It has also led to an increase in the number of small businesses 
advertising on the web.

===Mashups===

In distributed GIS, the term mashup refers to a generic web service which combines content and functionality from disparate sources; mashups reflect a separation of information and presentation.  Mashups are increasingly being used in commercial and government applications as well as in the public domain.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}
When used in [[GIS]], it reflects the concept of connecting an application with a mapping service.  An examples is combining [[Google maps]] with [[Chicago]] crime statistics to create the [http://www.chicagocrime.org/map/ Chicago crime statistics map].
Mashups are fast, provide value for money and remove responsibility for the data from the creator.

Second generation systems provide mashups mainly based on URL parameters, while Third generation systems (e.g. [[Google Maps]]) allow customisation via script (e.g. JavaScript).{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

==Strategy==
The development of the European Union (EU) ''[[Infrastructure for Spatial Information in the European Community]]'' (INSPIRE) initiative indicates this is a matter that is gaining more awareness at the national and EU scale. This states that there is a need to create ‘quality geo-referenced information’ that would be useful for a better understanding of human activities on environmental processes. Therefore, it is an ambitious project that aims to develop a European spatial information database.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ec-gis.org/inspire/ Infrastructure for Spatial Information in Europe] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011021506/http://www.ec-gis.org/inspire/ |date=2007-10-11 }} — EU INSPIRE Initiative.&lt;/ref&gt;

The GI strategy for Scotland was introduced in 2005 to provide a sustainable SDI, through the ’’One Scotland – One Geography’’ implementation plan. This documentation notes that it should be able to provide linkages to the ’’Spaces, Faces and Places of Scotland’’.
Although plans for a GI strategy have been in existence for some time, it was revealed at the AGI Scotland 2007 conference that a recent budget review by the [[Scottish government|Scottish Government]] indicated there will not be an allocation of resources to fund this initiative within the next term. Therefore, a business plan will need to be presented in order to outline the cost-benefits involved with taking up the strategy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Government/Open-scotland/OneScotland/Introduction The Scottish Government] —  Further information on the GIS Strategy for Scotland.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Standards==

The main standards for Distributed GIS are provided by the [[Open Geospatial Consortium]] (OGC).  OGC is a non-profit international group which seeks to Web-Enable GIS and in turn Geo-Enable the web.  One of the major issues concerning distributed GIS is the interoperability of the data since it can come in different formats using different projection systems.  OGC standards seek to provide interoperability between data and to integrate existing data.

===OGC===

In terms of interoperability, the use of communication standards in Distributed [[GIS]] is particularly important. General standards for [[Geospatial]] Data have been developed by the [[Open Geospatial Consortium]] (OGC). For the exchange of Geospatial Data over the web, the most important OGC standards are [[Web Map Service]] (WMS) and [[Web Feature Service]] (WFS).

Using OGC compliant [[Gateway (computer networking)|gateways]] allows for building very flexible Distributed GI Systems. Unlike monolithic GI Systems, OGC compliant systems are naturally [[web-based]] and do not have strict definitions of [[Server (computing)|servers]] and clients. For instance, if a user ([[Client (computing)|client]]) accesses a server, that server itself can act as a client of a number of further servers in order to retrieve data requested by the [[User (computing)|user]]. This concept allows for data retrieval from any number of different sources, providing consistent data standards are used.
This concept allows data transfer with systems not capable of GIS functionality. A key function of [[Open Geospatial Consortium|OGC standards]] is the integration of different systems already existing and thus geo-enabling the web. [[Web service]]s providing different functionality can be used simultaneously to combine data from different sources (mash-ups). Thus, different services on distributed servers can be combined for ‘service-chaining’ in order to add additional value to existing services. Providing a wide use of OGC standards by different web services, sharing distributed data of multiple organisations becomes possible.

Some important languages used in OGC compliant systems are described in the following. [[XML]] stands for eXtensible Markup language and is widely used for displaying and interpreting data from computers. Thus the development of a web-based GI system requires several useful XML encodings that can effectively describe two-dimensional graphics such as maps [[SVG]] and at the same time store and transfer simple features [[Geography Markup Language|GML]]. Because GML and SVG are both XML encodings, it is very straightforward to convert between the two using an XML Style Language Transformation [[XSLT]]. This gives an application a means of rendering GML, and in fact is the primary way that it has been accomplished among existing applications today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Harwell, R |url=  |title= Web Mapping with SVG |year=2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; XML can introduce innovative web services, in terms of [[GIS]]. It allows geographic information to be easily translated in graphic and in these terms scalar vector graphics (SVG) can produce high quality dynamic outputs by using data retrieved from spatial databases. In the same aspect Google, one of the pioneers in web-based GIS, has developed its own language which also uses a XML structure. [[Keyhole Markup Language]] (KML) is a file format used to display geographic data in an earth browser, such as Google Earth, Google Maps, and Google Maps for mobile browsers {{cite web |title=Google KML definition |url=http://code.google.com/apis/kml/documentation/ | accessdate=2007-11-21 }}

===Global System for Mobile Communications===
Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) is a global standard for mobile phones around  the world. Networks using the GSM system offer transmission of voice, data and messages in text and multimedia form and provide web, telenet, ftp, email services etc. over the mobile network. Almost two million people are now using GSM. Five main standards of GSM exist: GSM 400, GSM 850, GSM 900, GSM-1800 (DCS) and GSM1900 (PCS). GSM 850 and GSM 1900 is used in North America, parts of Latin America and parts of Africa. In Europe, Asia and Australia GSM 900/1800 standard is used.

GSM consists of two components: the mobile radio telephone and [[Subscriber Identity Module]]. GSM is a [[cellular network]], which is a radio network made up of a number of cells. For each cell, the transmitter (known as a base station) is transmitting and receiving signals. The base station is controlled through the Base Station Controller via the Mobile Switching Centre.

For GSM enhancement [[General Packet Radio Service]] (GPRS), a packet-oriented data service for data transmission, and [[Universal Mobile Telecommunications System]] (UTMS), the Third Generation ([[3G]]) mobile communication system, technology was introduced. Both provide similar services to 2G, but with greater [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] and speed.

===Wireless Application Protocol===
[[Wireless Application Protocol]] (WAP) is a standard for the data transmission of internet content and services. It is a secure specification that allows users to access the information instantly via mobile phones, pagers, two-way radios, smartphones and communicators. WAP supports [[HTML]] and [[XML]], and [[Wireless Markup Language|WML]] language, and is specifically designed for small screens and one-hand navigation without a keyboard. WML is scalable from two-line text displays up to the graphical screens found on smart phones. It is much stricter than HTML and is similar to [[JavaScript]].

==Geotagging==

{{main article|Geotagging}}

Geotagging is the process of adding geographical identification [[metadata]] to resources such as websites, RSS feed, images or videos. The metadata usually consist of latitude and longitude coordinates but may also include altitude, camera holding direction, place information and so on. [[Flickr]] website is one of the famous web services which host photos and provides functionality to add latitude and longitude information to the picture. The main idea is to use metadata related to pictures and photo collection. A geotag is simply a properly-formed [[XML]] tag giving the geographic coordinates of a place. The coordinates can be specified in latitude and longitude or in UTM ([[Universal Transverse Mercator]]) coordinates.

The RDFIG Geo vocabulary from the [[W3C]] is the common basis for the recommendations. It supplies official global names for the latitude, longitude, and altitude properties. These are given in a system of coordinates known as "the WGS84 datum". A geographic datum specifies an ellispoidal approximation to the Earth's surface; WGS84 is the most commonly used such datum.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.w3.org/2003/01/geo/wgs84_pos#&lt;/ref&gt;

== Parallel Processing ==

[[Parallel computing|Parallel processing]] is the use of multiple [[CPU]]’s to execute different sections of a program together.  [[Remote sensing]] and surveying equipment have been providing vast amounts of spatial information, and how to manage, process or dispose of this data have become major issues in the field of [[Geographic Information Science]] (GIS).&lt;ref name="ieeexplore.ieee.org"&gt;Qinghui Sun, Tianhe Chi, Xiaoli Wang, and Dawei Zhong. [http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/iel5/10226/32596/01525244.pdf?arnumber=1525244]. Design of Middleware Based Grid GIS&lt;/ref&gt; To solve these problems there has been much research into the area of parallel processing of GIS information.  This involves the utilization of a single computer with multiple processors or multiple computers that are connected over a network working on the same task.&lt;ref name="llnltut"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.llnl.gov/computing/tutorials/parallel_comp/ |title=Introduction to Parallel Computing |accessdate=2007-11-09 |author=Blaise Barney |publisher=Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are many different types of distributed computing, two of the most common are [[Computer cluster|clustering]] and [[grid computing|grid processing]].

Some consider [[grid computing]] to be “the third information technology wave” after the Internet and Web, and will be the backbone of the next generation of services and applications that are going to further the research and development of GIS and related areas.&lt;ref name="ieeexplore.ieee.org"/&gt;  [[Grid computing]] allows for the sharing of processing power, enabling the attainment of high performances in computing, management and services.  Grid computing, (unlike the conventional supercomputer that does parallel computing by linking multiple processors over a system bus) uses a network of computers to execute a program.

The problem of using multiple computers lies in the difficulty of dividing up the tasks among the computers, without having to reference portions of the code being executed on other CPUs.
[[Amdahl's law]] expresses the speedup of a program as a result of parallelization.
It states that potential program speedup is defined by the fraction of code (P) that can be parallelized:  1/(1-P).
If the code cannot be broken up to run over multiple processors, P = 0 and the speedup = 1 (no speedup). If it is possible to break up the code to be perfectly parallel then P = 1 and the speedup is infinite, in theory though practical limits occur.  Thus, there is an upper bound on the usefulness of adding more parallel execution units.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.llnl.gov/computing/tutorials/parallel_comp/]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Gustafson's law]] is a law closely related to Amdahl's law but doesn’t make as many assumptions and tries to model these factors in the representation of performance. The equation can be modelled by S(P) = P − α * (P − 1) where P is the number of processors, S is the speedup, and α the non-parallelizable part of the process.

The '''Douglas Complex''' is a {{convert|54|m|ft|adj=on}} high system of three linked [[oil platform|platforms]] in the [[Irish Sea]], {{convert|24|km}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.offshore-technology.com/projects/bhp/bhp1.html| title=Offshore Liverpool Bay Development| work=Offshore Technology| accessdate=2007-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; off the [[North Wales]] coast. The Douglas [[oil field]] was discovered in 1990, and production commenced in 1996.  Now operated by [[Eni]], the complex consists of the [[wellhead]] platform, which drills into the [[seabed]], a processing platform, which separates [[oil]], [[gas]] and water, and thirdly an accommodation platform, which is composed of living quarters for the crew. This accommodation module was formerly the Morecambe Flame [[Jackup rig|jack-up drilling rig]].

The Douglas Complex is also the control hub for other platforms in the area, and provides power for all platforms. It also offers recreational, catering and medical facilities for up to 80&amp;nbsp;personnel.&lt;ref name=vp&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.prestatyn.org.uk/offshore.industry/| title=Offshore Industry| work=Virtual Prestatyn| accessdate=2007-12-03| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071024180755/http://www.prestatyn.org.uk/offshore.industry/| archivedate = October 24, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oil from the Lennox, Hamilton, and Hamilton North unmanned satellite platforms is received and blended at the complex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= http://www.engineeringtalk.com/news/avt/avt113.html| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110522043202/http://www.engineeringtalk.com/news/avt/avt113.html| archivedate= 2011-05-22| title= Hazardous area instrumentation is all at sea | work= Engineering Talk | date=2006-05-09 | accessdate=2007-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fluids from the Lennox installation via the gas pipeline are treated on the Douglas installation in the 3-phase (oil, gas and produced water) Lennox Production Separator.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;PFD Separation and Stripping, undated&lt;/ref&gt; Following separation, gas flows to the Offgas Compressor suction manifold. Oil is directed to the Oil Stripper where the liquid is stripped of sour gas using a counter-current flow of stripping gas. Produced water from the separator is directed to the Produced Water Hydrocyclones where hydrocarbon liquids are removed prior to overboard disposal. Well fluids from the Douglas Wellhead tower are treated in the 3-phase Douglas Production Separator. Gas flows to the Offgas Compressor suction manifold and hydrocarbon liquids are directed to the Oil Stripper, and water to hydrocyclones as described above. Oil from the Oil Stripper is pumped by the Oil Transfer Pumps via Fiscal metering to the Main Oil Transfer Pumps to tanker loading. Gas from the Oil Stripper is compressed and sent to the Offgas Compressor.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Gas is sent through a [[Pipeline transport|pipeline]] {{convert|33.5|km|adj=on}} long to a [[Point of Ayr Gas Terminal|processing plant at Point of Ayr]], in [[Flintshire]], North Wales. After processing, almost the entire output is sold to E.ON to fire the [[combined cycle gas turbine]] [[power station]] at [[Connah's Quay]], on [[Deeside]], in Flintshire. Oil produced in [[Liverpool Bay]] is sent through another pipeline, 17&amp;nbsp;km long, to the [[Offshore Storage Installation (Liverpool Bay)|Offshore Storage Installation]], a permanently anchored [[barge]] which acts as a floating oil terminal, capable of holding {{bbl to t|870|mlt=k}} of oil. From the floating terminal oil is transferred to tankers approximately once every month.&lt;ref name=vp/&gt;

[[Image:LV switchboard.jpg|thumb|A modern electric switchboard]]
[[File:Antique-Electrical-Switchboard.jpg|thumb|Antique electrical switchboard, operational at a US plant in 2014. It features open style breakers, mounted on slabs of slate stone insulator.]]

An '''electric switchboard''' is a device that directs [[electricity]] from one or more sources of supply to several smaller regions of usage. It is an assembly of one or more panels, each of which contains [[switch]]es that allow electricity to be redirected. 

==Definition==
The U.S. [[National Electrical Code]] (NEC) defines a switchboard as "a large single panel, frame, or assembly of panels on which are mounted, on the face, back, or both, switches, over-current and other protective devices, [[busbar|buses]], and usually instruments". The role of a switchboard is to allow the division of the current supplied to the switchboard into smaller currents for further distribution and to provide switching, current protection and (possibly) metering for those various currents. In general, switchboards may distribute power to transformers, panelboards, control equipment, and, ultimately, to individual system loads.

==Components==
Inside a switchboard there will be one or more [[busbar]]s. These are flat strips of copper or aluminum, to which the switchgear is connected. Busbars carry large [[current (electricity)|current]]s through the switchboard, and are supported by insulators. Bare busbars are common, but many types are now manufactured with an insulating cover on the bars, leaving only connection points exposed.

The operator is protected from [[electric shock|electrocution]] by safety switches and [[fuse (electrical)|fuses]]. There may also be controls for the supply of electricity to the switchboard, coming from a generator or bank of [[electrical generator]]s, especially [[frequency]] control of [[AC power]] and load sharing controls, plus gauges showing frequency and perhaps a [[synchroscope]]. The amount of power going into a switchboard must always equal to the power going out to the loads.

==Enclosure==
Modern industrial switchboards are metal enclosed and of "dead front" construction; no energized parts are accessible when the covers and panels are closed.  Previously, open switchboards were made with switches and other devices were mounted on panels made of slate, granite, or ebony asbestos board. The metal enclosure of the switchboard is bonded to earth ground for protection of personnel.  Large switchboards may be free-standing floor-mounted enclosures with provision for incoming connections at either the top or bottom of the enclosure. A switchboard may have incoming bus bars or bus duct for the source connection, and also for large circuits fed from the board.  A switchboard  may include a metering or control compartment separated from the power distribution conductors.

[[File:Efficiency diagram by Zureks.svg|thumb|Useful output energy is always lower than input energy.]]
[[File:Ene Flow Pow Plt uni.png|thumb|Efficiency of power plants, world total, 2008]]

'''Energy conversion efficiency''' ('''''η''''') is the [[ratio]] between the useful output of an [[energy conversion machine]] and the input, in [[energy]] terms. The input, as well as the useful output may be [[chemical]], [[electric power]], [[mechanical work]], [[light]] (radiation), or [[heat]].{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

== Overview ==
Energy conversion efficiency depends on the usefulness of the output. All or part of the heat produced from burning a fuel may become rejected [[waste heat]] if, for example, work is the desired output from a [[thermodynamic cycle]]. Energy converter is an example of an energy transformation. For example a light bulb falls into the categories energy converter.  
&lt;math&gt;
\eta = \frac{P_\mathrm{out}}{P_\mathrm{in}}
&lt;/math&gt;
Even though the definition includes the notion of usefulness, [[wikt:efficiency|efficiency]] is considered a [[technology|technical]] or [[physics|physical]] term. Goal or mission oriented terms include [[effectiveness]] and [[efficacy]].

Generally, energy conversion efficiency is a [[dimensionless]] number between 0 and 1.0, or 0% to 100%.  Efficiencies may not exceed 100%, e.g., for a [[perpetual motion]] machine.  However, other [[thermal efficiency|effectiveness measures]] that can exceed 1.0 are used for [[heat pumps]] and other devices that move heat rather than convert it.

When talking about the efficiency of heat engines and power stations the convention should be stated, i.e., HHV ({{aka}} Gross Heating Value, etc.) or LCV (a.k.a. Net Heating value), and  whether gross output (at the generator terminals) or net output (at the power station fence) are being considered.  The two are separate but both must be stated. Failure to do so causes endless confusion.

Related, more specific terms include

==Fuel heating values and efficiency==
In Europe the usable energy content of fuel is typically calculated using the '''[[lower heating value]]''' (LHV) of that fuel, the definition of which assumes that the [[water vapor]] produced during fuel [[combustion]] (oxidation), remains gaseous, and is not [[condensation|condensed]] to liquid water so the latent heat of vaporization of that water is not  usable. Using the LHV, a [[condensing boiler]] can achieve a "heating efficiency" in excess of 100% (this does not violate the [[first law of thermodynamics]] as long as the LHV convention is understood, but does cause confusion). This is because the apparatus recovers part of the [[heat of vaporization]], which is not included in the definition of the lower heating value of fuel.{{Citation needed|date=October 2014}} In the U.S. and elsewhere, the '''[[higher heating value]]''' (HHV) is used, which includes the latent heat for condensing the water vapor, and thus the thermodynamic maximum of 100% efficiency cannot be exceeded with HHV's use.

==Wall-plug efficiency, luminous efficiency, and efficacy==
[[File:Rare gas flashtube spectral outputs.JPG|thumb|The absolute irradiance of four different gases when used in a flashtube. Xenon is by far the most efficient of the gases, although krypton is more effective at a specific wavelength of light.]]
[[File:Eyesensitivity.svg|thumb|The sensitivity of the human eye to various wavelengths. Assuming each wavelength equals 1 watt of radiant energy, only the center wavelength is perceived as 685 [[candela]]s (1 watt of luminous energy), equaling 685 lumens. The vertical colored-lines represent the 589 (yellow) sodium line, and popular 532 nm (green), 671 nm (red), 473 nm (blue), and 405 nm (violet) laser pointers.]]
[[File:Fluorescent Energy.svg|thumb|A [[Sankey diagram]] showing the multiple stages of energy loss between the wall plug and the light output of a fluorescent lamp. The greatest losses occur due to the Stokes shift.]]

In optical systems such as lighting and [[laser]]s, the energy conversion efficiency is often referred to as [[wall-plug efficiency]]. The wall-plug efficiency is the measure of output radiative-energy, in [[watt]]s ([[joule]]s per second), per the total of the input electrical-energy in watts. The output-energy is usually measured in terms of [[Absolute scale|absolute]] [[irradiance]] and the wall-plug efficiency is given as a percentage of the total input-energy, with the inverse percentage representing the losses.

The wall-plug efficiency differs from the ''luminous efficiency'' in that wall-plug efficiency describes the direct output/input conversion of energy (the amount of [[Work (physics)|work]] that can be performed) whereas luminous efficiency takes into account the human eye's varying sensitivity to different wavelengths (how well it can illuminate a space). Instead of using watts, the power of a light source to produce wavelengths proportional to human perception is measured in [[lumen (unit)|lumen]]s. The human eye is most sensitive to wavelengths of 555 [[nanometer]]s (greenish-yellow) but the sensitivity decreases dramatically to either side of this wavelength, following a [[Gaussian profile|Gaussian]] power-curve and dropping to zero sensitivity at the red and violet ends of the spectrum. Due to this the eye does not usually see all of the wavelengths emitted by a particular light-source, nor does it see all of the wavelengths within the visual spectrum equally. Yellow and green, for example, make up more than 50% of what the eye perceives as being white, even though in terms of radiant energy white-light is made from equal portions of all colors (i.e.: a 5 mw green laser appears brighter than a 5 mw red laser, yet the red laser stands-out better against a white background). Therefore, the [[radiant intensity]] of a light source may be much greater than its [[luminous intensity]], meaning that the source emits more energy than the eye can use. Likewise, the lamp's wall-plug efficiency is usually greater than its luminous efficiency. The effectiveness of a light source to convert electrical energy into wavelengths of visible light, in proportion to the sensitivity of the human eye, is referred to as [[luminous efficacy]], which is measured in units of lumens per watt (lm/w) of electrical input-energy. 

Unlike efficacy (effectiveness), which is a [[unit of measurement]], efficiency is [[unitless]] number expressed as a [[percentage]], requiring only that the input and output units be of the same type. Therefore, the luminous efficiency of a light source is the percentage of luminous efficacy per the theoretical-maximum efficacy at a specific wavelength. The amount of energy carried by a photon of light is determined by its wavelength. In lumens, this energy is offset by the eye's sensitivity to the selected wavelengths. For example, a green [[laser pointer]] can have greater than 30 times the apparent brightness of a red pointer of the same power output. At 555 nm in wavelength, 1 watt of radiant energy is equivalent to 685 lumens, thus a monochromatic light source at this wavelength, with a luminous efficacy of 685 lm/w, has a luminous efficiency of 100%. The theoretical-maximum efficacy lowers for wavelengths at either side of 555 nm. For example, [[low-pressure sodium lamp]]s produce [[monochromatic light]] at 589 nm with a luminous efficacy of 200 lm/w, which is the highest of any lamp. The theoretical-maximum efficacy at that wavelength is 525 lm/w, so the lamp has a luminous efficiency of 38.1%. Because the lamp is monochromatic, the luminous efficiency nearly matches the wall-plug efficiency of &lt; 40%.&lt;ref&gt;''Applied Atomic Collision Physics, Volume 5'' by H. S. W. Massey, E. W. McDaniel, B. Bederson -- Academic Press 1982 Page 383&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.photonics.com/a28677/Efficacy_Limits_for_Solid-State_White_Light&lt;/ref&gt; 

Calculations for luminous efficiency become more complex for lamps that produce white light or a mixture of spectral lines. [[Fluorescent lamps]] have higher wall-plug efficiencies than low-pressure sodium lamps, but only have half the luminous efficacy of ~ 100 lm/w, thus the luminous efficiency of fluorescents is lower than sodium lamps. A xenon [[flashtube]] has a typical wall-plug efficiency of 50--70%, exceeding that of most other forms of lighting. Because the flashtube emits large amounts of infrared and ultraviolet radiation, only a portion of the output energy is used by the eye. The luminous efficacy is therefore typically around 50 lm/w. However, not all applications for lighting involve the human eye nor are restricted to visible wavelengths. For [[laser pumping]], the efficacy is not related to the human eye so it is not called "luminous" efficacy, but rather simply "efficacy" as it relates to the absorption lines of the [[laser medium]]. Krypton flashtubes are often chosen for pumping [[Nd:YAG laser]]s, even though their wall-plug efficiency is typically only ~ 40%. [[Krypton]]'s spectral lines better match the absorption lines of the [[neodymium]]-[[Dopant|doped]] crystal, thus the efficacy of krypton for this purpose is much higher than [[xenon]]; able to produce up to twice the laser output for the same electrical input.&lt;ref&gt;''Advanced Optical Instruments and Techniques'' by Daniel Malacara Hernández -- CRC Press 2018 Page 589&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Solid-state laser engineering'' by Walter Koechner – Springer-Verlag 1965 Page 335&lt;/ref&gt; All of these terms refer to the amount of energy and lumens as they exit the light source, disregarding any losses that might occur within the lighting fixture or subsequent output optics. ''Luminaire efficiency'' refers to the total lumen-output from the fixture per the lamp output.&lt;ref&gt;''Understanding LED Illumination'' by M. Nisa Khan -- CRC Press 2014 Page 21--23&lt;/ref&gt;

With the exception of a few light sources, such as [[incandescent light bulb]]s, most light sources have multiple stages of energy conversion between the "wall plug" (electrical input point, which may include batteries, direct wiring, or other sources) and the final light-output, with each stage producing a loss. Low-pressure sodium lamps initially convert the electrical energy using an [[electrical ballast]], to maintain the proper current and voltage, but some energy is lost in the ballast. Similarly, fluorescent lamps also convert the electricity using a ballast (electronic efficiency). The electricity is then converted into light energy by the [[electrical arc]] (electrode efficiency and discharge efficiency). The light is then transferred to a fluorescent coating that only absorbs suitable wavelengths, with some losses of those wavelengths due to reflection off and transmission through the coating (transfer efficiency). The number of photons absorbed by the coating will not match the number then reemitted as [[fluorescence]] ([[Quantum yield|quantum efficiency]]). Finally, due to the phenomenon of the [[Stokes shift]], the reemitted photons will have a shorter wavelength (thus lower energy) than the absorbed photons (fluorescence efficiency). In very similar fashion, lasers also experience many stages of conversion between the wall plug and the output [[aperture]]. The terms "wall-plug efficiency" or "energy conversion efficiency" are therefore used to denote the overall efficiency of the energy-conversion device, deducting the losses from each stage, although this may exclude external components needed to operate some devices, such as coolant pumps.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.rp-photonics.com/wall_plug_efficiency.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Handbook of Luminescent Semiconductor Materials'' by Leah Bergman, Jeanne L. McHale -- CRC Press 2012 Page 270&lt;/ref&gt;

They are used at both ends of [[driveshaft]]s, protecting [[constant-velocity joint]]s from the ingress of dirt, and retaining the grease. They also prevent the ingress of dirt where one component slides within another, for example, on [[suspension (vehicle)|suspension]] struts or the ends of [[steering]] racks. Finally, they are also usually used to perform the same function on [[ball joint]]s, which appear on suspension [[Double wishbone suspension|wishbone]]s and steering [[tie rod]] ends.  
The [[gear stick]] gaiter is to resist dirt entering the ball joint at the bottom of the stick and to not have oil or grease from the joint exposed to passengers.  They are commonly leather, [[faux leather]], rubber or a waterproof cloth.

[[File:HEMT-band structure scheme-en.svg|thumb|350px|[[Band diagram]] of GaAs/AlGaAs [[heterojunction]]-based HEMT, at equilibrium.]]

A '''High-electron-mobility transistor''' ('''HEMT'''), also known as '''heterostructure FET''' ('''HFET''') or '''modulation-doped FET''' ('''MODFET'''), is a [[field-effect transistor]] incorporating a junction between two materials with different [[band gap]]s (i.e. a [[heterojunction]]) as the channel instead of a doped region (as is generally the case for [[MOSFET]]). A commonly used material combination is [[Gallium arsenide|GaAs]] with [[Aluminium gallium arsenide|AlGaAs]], though there is wide variation, dependent on the application of the device. Devices incorporating more [[indium]] generally show better high-frequency performance, while in recent years, [[gallium nitride]] HEMTs have attracted attention due to their high-power performance. Like other [[FET]]s, HEMTs are used in [[integrated circuits]] as digital on-off switches.  FETs can also be used as amplifiers for large amounts of current using a small voltage as a control signal.  Both of these uses are made possible by the FET’s unique [[current-voltage characteristic]]s. HEMT transistors are able to operate at higher frequencies than ordinary transistors, up to [[millimeter wave]] frequencies, and are used in high-frequency products such as [[cell phone]]s, [[satellite television]] receivers, [[voltage converter]]s, and [[radar]] equipment. They are widely used in satellite receivers, in low power amplifiers and in the defense industry.

== Advantages ==
Advantages of HEMTs are that they have high gain, this makes them useful as amplifiers; high switching speeds, which are achieved because the main charge carriers in MODFETs are majority carriers, and minority carriers are not significantly involved; and extremely low noise values because the current variation in these devices is low compared to other FETs.

== Invention ==
The invention of the HEMT is usually attributed to Takashi Mimura (三村 高志) ([[Fujitsu]], Japan) who demonstrated it in 1980.&lt;ref&gt;Takashi Mimura: 'The Early History of the High Electron Mobility Transistor (HEMT)',IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON MICROWAVE THEORY AND TECHNIQUES, VOL. 50, NO. 3, MARCH 2002,.&lt;/ref&gt; In America, [[Ray Dingle]], [[Arthur Gossard]] and [[Horst Störmer]] also played an important role in the invention of the HEMT who also filed for a patent on such a device in April 1978.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent | country=US | number=4163237 | title=High mobility multilayered heterojunction devices employing modulated doping | inventor=Ray Dingle, Arthur Gossard and Horst Störmer}}&lt;/ref&gt; Daniel Delagebeaudeuf and Trong Linh Nuyen from [[Thomson-CSF]] (France) filed for a patent of this device in March 1979.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent|country=US |number=4471366 |title=Field effect transistor with high cut-off frequency and process for forming same |inventor=Daniel Delagebeaudeuf and Trong L. Nuyen}} [http://www.google.com/patents/US4471366 google patents link]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Conceptual analysis ==

HEMTs are [[heterojunction]]s.  This means that the semiconductors used have dissimilar [[band gap]]s.  For instance, silicon has a band gap of 1.1 [[electron volt]]s (eV), while germanium has a band gap of 0.67 eV.  When a heterojunction is formed, the conduction band and [[valence band]] throughout the material must bend in order to form a continuous level.

The HEMTs' exceptional [[electron mobility |carrier mobility]] and switching speed come from the following conditions:  The wide band element is doped with donor atoms; thus it has excess [[electron]]s in its conduction band.  These electrons will diffuse to the adjacent narrow band material’s conduction band due to the availability of states with lower energy.  The movement of electrons will cause a change in potential and thus an electric field between the materials.  The electric field will push electrons back to the wide band element’s conduction band.  The diffusion process continues until electron diffusion and electron drift balance each other, creating a junction at equilibrium similar to a [[p-n junction]].  Note that the undoped narrow band gap material now has excess majority charge carriers.  The fact that the charge carriers are majority carriers yields high switching speeds, and the fact that the low band gap semiconductor is undoped means that there are no donor atoms to cause scattering and thus yields high mobility.

An important aspect of HEMTs is that the band discontinuities across the conduction and valence bands can be modified separately. This allows the type of carriers in and out of the device to be controlled. As HEMTs require electrons to be the main carriers, a graded doping can be applied in one of the materials making the conduction band discontinuity smaller, and keeping the valence band discontinuity the same. This diffusion of carriers leads to the accumulation of electrons along the boundary of the two regions inside the narrow band gap material. The accumulation of electrons leads to a very high current in these devices. The accumulated electrons are also known as [[2DEG]] or two-dimensional electron gas.

The term "[[modulation doping]]" refers to the fact that the dopants are spatially in a different region from the current carrying electrons.  This technique was invented by [[Horst Störmer]] at [[Bell Labs]].

== Explanation ==
To allow conduction, semiconductors are doped with impurities which donate either mobile electrons or [[Electron hole|holes]]. However, these electrons are slowed down through collisions with the impurities (dopants) used to generate them in the first place. HEMTs avoid this through the use of high mobility electrons generated using the heterojunction of a highly doped wide-bandgap n-type donor-supply layer (AlGaAs in our example) and a non-doped narrow-bandgap channel layer with no dopant impurities (GaAs in this case).

The electrons generated in the thin n-type AlGaAs layer drop completely into the GaAs layer to form a depleted AlGaAs layer, because the heterojunction created by different band-gap materials forms a [[quantum well]] (a steep canyon) in the conduction band on the GaAs side where the electrons can move quickly without colliding with any impurities because the GaAs layer is undoped, and from which they cannot escape. The effect of this is to create a very thin layer of highly mobile conducting electrons with very high concentration, giving the channel very low [[resistivity]] (or to put it another way, "high electron mobility"). 

===Electrostatic mechanism===

{{main|Heterojunction}}

Since GaAs has higher [[electron affinity]], free electrons in the AlGaAs layer are transferred to the undoped GaAs layer where they form a two dimensional high mobility electron gas within 100 [[ångström]] (10 [[nanometre|nm]]) of the interface. The n-type AlGaAs layer of the HEMT is depleted completely through two depletion mechanisms:
* Trapping of free electrons by surface states causes the surface depletion.
* Transfer of electrons into the undoped GaAs layer brings about the interface depletion.

The [[Fermi level]] of the gate metal is matched to the pinning point, which is 1.2 [[Electron volt|eV]] below the conduction band. With the reduced AlGaAs layer thickness, the electrons supplied by donors in the AlGaAs layer are insufficient to pin the layer. As a result, band bending is moving upward and the two-dimensional electrons gas does not appear. When a positive voltage greater than the threshold voltage is applied to the gate, electrons accumulate at the interface and form a two-dimensional electron gas.

== Manufacture ==
MODFETs can be manufactured by [[epitaxial growth]] of a strained [[SiGe]] layer. In the strained layer, the [[germanium]] content increases linearly to around 40-50%. This concentration of germanium allows the formation of a [[quantum well]] structure with a high [[conduction band]] offset and a high density of very mobile [[charge carrier]]s. The end result is a FET with ultra-high switching speeds and low noise. [[InGaAs]]/[[AlGaAs]], [[Aluminium gallium nitride|AlGaN]]/[[InGaN]], and other compounds are also used in place of SiGe.  InP and GaN are starting to replace SiGe as the base material in MODFETs because of their better noise and power ratios.

== Versions of HEMTs ==

=== By growth technology: pHEMT and mHEMT ===
Ideally, the two different materials used for a heterojunction would have the same [[lattice constant]] (spacing between the atoms). In practice, the lattice constants are typically slightly different (e.g. AlGaAs on GaAs), resulting in crystal defects. As an analogy, imagine pushing together two plastic combs with a slightly different spacing.  At regular intervals, you'll see two teeth clump together. In semiconductors, these discontinuities form [[deep-level trap]]s and greatly reduce device performance.

A HEMT where this rule is violated is called a '''pHEMT''' or '''pseudomorphic''' HEMT. This is achieved by using an extremely thin layer of one of the materials – so thin that the crystal lattice simply stretches to fit the other material. This technique allows the construction of transistors with larger [[bandgap]] differences than otherwise possible, giving them better performance.&lt;ref name=Cooke2006&gt;[http://www.semiconductor-today.com/features/Semiconductor%20Today%20-%20Transcending%20frequency%20and%20integration%20limits.pdf Indium Phosphide: Transcending frequency and integration limits. Semiconductor TODAY Compounds&amp;AdvancedSilicon • Vol. 1 • Issue 3 • September 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;

Another way to use materials of different lattice constants is to place a buffer layer between them. This is done in the '''mHEMT''' or '''metamorphic''' HEMT, an advancement of the pHEMT. The buffer layer is made of [[Aluminium indium arsenide|AlInAs]], with the indium concentration graded so that it can match the lattice constant of both the GaAs substrate and the [[Indium gallium arsenide|GaInAs]] channel. This brings the advantage that practically any Indium concentration in the channel can be realized, so the devices can be optimized for different applications (low indium concentration provides low [[Noise (electronic)|noise]]; high indium concentration gives high [[Gain (electronics)|gain]]).{{cn|date=January 2016}}

=== By electrical behaviour: eHEMT and dHEMT ===
HEMTs made of semiconductor hetero-interfaces lacking interfacial net polarization charge, such as AlGaAs/GaAs, require positive gate voltage or appropriate donor-doping in the AlGaAs barrier to attract the electrons towards the gate, which forms the 2D electron gas and enables conduction of electron currents. This behaviour is similar to that of commonly used field-effect transistors in the enhancement mode, and such a device is called enhancement HEMT, or '''eHEMT'''.

When a HEMT is built from [[AlGaN]]/[[GaN]], higher power density and breakdown voltage can be achieved. Nitrides also have different crystal structure with lower symmetry, namely the [[wurtzite crystal structure|wurtzite]] one, which has built-in electrical polarisation. Since this polarization differs between the [[GaN]] ''channel'' layer and [[AlGaN]] ''barrier'' layer, a sheet of uncompensated charge in the order of 0.01-0.03 C/m&lt;math&gt;^2&lt;/math&gt; is formed. Due to the crystal orientation typically used for epitaxial growth ("gallium-faced") and the device geometry favorable for fabrication (gate on top), this charge sheet is positive, causing the 2D electron gas to be formed even if there is no doping. Such a transistor is normally on, and will turn off only if the gate is negatively biased - thus this kind of HEMT is known as ''depletion HEMT'', or '''dHEMT'''. By sufficient doping of the barrier with acceptors (e.g. [[magnesium|Mg]]), the built-in charge can be compensated to restore the more customary '''eHEMT''' operation, however high-density p-doping of nitrides is technologically challenging due to dopant diffusion into the channel.

===Induced HEMT ===
{{unreferenced|section|date=August 2017}}
In contrast to a modulation-doped HEMT, an induced high electron mobility transistor provides the flexibility to tune different electron densities with a top gate, since the charge carriers are "induced" to the [[2DEG]] plane rather than created by dopants. The absence of a doped layer enhances the electron mobility significantly when compared to their modulation-doped counterparts.
This level of cleanliness provides opportunities to perform research into the field of [[Quantum billiard ball|Quantum Billiard]] for [[quantum chaos]] studies, or applications in ultra stable and ultra sensitive electronic devices.{{cn|date=January 2016}}

== Applications ==
Applications (eg for AlGaAs on GaAs) are similar to those of [[MESFET]]s – [[microwave]] and [[millimeter wave]] [[telecommunication|communications]], imaging, [[radar]], and [[radio astronomy]] – any application where high gain and low noise at high frequencies are required. HEMTs have shown current gain to frequencies greater than 600&amp;nbsp;GHz and power gain to frequencies greater than 1 THz.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.semiconductor-today.com/news_items/2014/OCT/NORTHROP-GRUMMAN_311014.shtml&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Heterojunction bipolar transistor]]s were demonstrated at current gain frequencies over 600&amp;nbsp;GHz in April 2005.) Numerous companies worldwide develop and manufacture HEMT-based devices. These can be discrete transistors but are more usually in the form of a 'monolithic microwave integrated circuit' ([[MMIC]]). 
HEMTs are found in many types of equipment ranging from cellphones and [[Direct broadcast satellite|DBS]] receivers to [[electronic warfare]] systems such as [[radar]] and for [[radio astronomy]].

Furthermore, gallium nitride HEMTs on silicon substrates are used as power switching transistors for voltage converter applications. Compared to silicon power transistors gallium nitride HEMTs feature low on-state resistances, and low switching losses due to the wide bandgap properties. Gallium nitride power HEMTs are commercially available up to voltages of 200 V-600 V.

[[Nokia]]'s devices division was acquired by Microsoft in early 2014 and has since been rebranded as [[Microsoft Mobile]].  Microsoft Mobile continued to release Nokia-branded handsets running Windows Phone until a clearer strategy for aligning the Microsoft and Nokia brands was decided on in October 2014. This was to replace the Nokia name on future Lumia devices with [[Microsoft Lumia]] branding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Jaatinen|first1=Tina|title=Say hello to Microsoft Lumia|url=http://lumiaconversations.microsoft.com/2014/10/24/say-hello-microsoft-lumia/|accessdate=18 December 2014|work=Lumia Conversations|agency=Microsoft Mobile OY|date=24 October 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20141218190803/http://lumiaconversations.microsoft.com/2014/10/24/say-hello-microsoft-lumia/|archivedate=18 December 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first device released without Nokia branding was the [[Lumia 535]].

During the [[Dot-com bubble|dot-com]]/[[internet]] bubble of the late 1990s and early 2000, the proliferation of many dot-com [[Startup company|start-up companies]] created a secondary bubble in the [[telecommunications]]/[[computer networking]] infrastructure and telecommunications [[service provider]] markets. [[Venture capital]] and [[high tech]] companies rushed to build next generation infrastructure equipment for the expected explosion of internet traffic.   
As part of that investment fever, [[Network processor]]s were seen as a method of dealing with the desire for
more network services and the ever-increasing data-rates of communication networks.

It has been estimated that dozens of start-up companies were created in the race to build the processors that would be a component of the next generation telecommunications equipment. Once the internet investment bubble burst, the telecom network upgrade cycle was deferred for years (perhaps for a decade). As a result, the majority of these new companies went bankrupt.

As of 2007, the only companies that are shipping network processors in sizeable volumes are [[Cisco Systems]], [[Marvell Technology Group|Marvell]], [[Freescale]], [[Cavium Networks]] and [[Applied Micro Circuits Corporation|AMCC]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4693">The [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] [[iPod]] line has been upgraded many times, and each significant revision is called a "[[generation]]". Only the most recent generation of the iPod Touch line is available from Apple. Each new generation usually had more features and refinements while typically being physically smaller and lighter than its predecessor, while usually (but not always) retaining the older model's price tag. Notable changes included the touch-sensitive click wheel replacing the mechanical scroll wheel, use of color displays, and [[flash memory]] replacing [[hard disk]]s.

[[Image:Nano omores.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Product Red]] 2nd generation [[iPod Nano]].]]
The software bundled with the first generation iPod was Macintosh-only, so Windows users had to use third-party updates like [[ephPod]] or [[XPlay]] to manage their music. When Apple introduced the second generation of iPods in July 2002, they sold two versions, one that included iTunes for Macintosh users and another that included [[Musicmatch Jukebox]] for Windows users.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.apple.com/pr/library/2002/jul/17ipod.html Apple Unveils New iPods] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110124100832/http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2002/jul/17ipod.html |date=2011-01-24 }}, ''[[Apple Inc.]]'', 2002-07-17. Retrieved on 2007-02-19.&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2003, Apple released the Windows version of iTunes,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.apple.com/pr/library/2003/oct/16itms.html Apple Launches iTunes for Windows], ''[[Apple Inc.]]'', 2003-10-16. Retrieved on 2006-11-26.&lt;/ref&gt; and started selling iPods that included both Macintosh and Windows versions of iTunes so that they could be used with either platform. Current iPods no longer ship with iTunes, which must be downloaded from Apple's website.

In December 2004, Apple unveiled its first limited edition iPods, with either [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]]’s, [[Tony Hawk]]’s, or [[Beck]]’s signature or [[No Doubt]]'s band logo engraved on the back for an extra US$50.&lt;ref&gt;Dalrymple, Jim. [http://www.macworld.com/news/2002/12/10/ipod/index.php Limited Edition Kelsey, Lucas Samuel, Beck iPods]. ''[[Macworld]]'', 2002-09-10. Retrieved on 2007-01-07.&lt;/ref&gt; On 26 October 2004, Apple introduced a special edition of its fourth generation monochrome iPod, designed in the color scheme of the album ''[[How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb]]'' by Irish rock band [[U2]]. It had a black case with a red click wheel and the back had the engraved signatures of U2's band members. This iPod was updated alongside the [[iPod Photo]] and fifth generation iPod.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cashmygadget.co.uk/Blog-Tips-to-Sell-Your-Apple-iPod-2#post42|title=Tips About Your Apple iPod|last=|first=|date=|website=|language=UK|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161228125829/http://www.cashmygadget.co.uk/Blog-Tips-to-Sell-Your-Apple-iPod-2#post42|archive-date=2016-12-28|dead-url=yes|access-date=2017-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 13, 2006, Apple released a special edition 4&amp;nbsp;GB red iPod nano as part of the [[Product Red]] campaign. An 8&amp;nbsp;GB version was released three weeks later and both of them sold for the same price as the standard models.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://everymac.com/systems/apple/ipod/specs/ipod-2nd-generation-nano-red-specs.html|title=Apple iPod nano 2nd Gen (RED) 4 GB, 8 GB Specs|work=Everymac.com|accessdate=June 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; US$10 from each sale is donated to [[The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis &amp; Malaria]]. On September 5, 2007, Apple also added a Product Red iPod Shuffle model. They did not disclose how much will be donated to charity from this model. Apple also released Special Edition [[Harry Potter]] iPods to accompany the iPod Photo. These were engraved with the [[Hogwarts]] Crest on the back and were only available to purchasers of the ''Harry Potter'' [[audiobook]]s. They were updated when the fifth generation iPods were released, but were only available for a limited time.

On July 27, 2017, Apple discontinued the iPod Shuffle and iPod Nano.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/story/goodbye-ipod-and-thanks-for-all-the-tunes/|title=Goodbye iPod, and Thanks for All the Tunes|last=Pierce|first=David|work=Wired|date=July 27, 2017|accessdate=August 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apple plans to keep the iPod Touch, as it is the most popular iPod device.{{fact|date=November 2017}}

'''Marion Charlotte Thurnauer''' is an American [[chemist]] at the [[Argonne National Laboratory]].   She was the first woman to be promoted to a staff position in the Chemistry Division (CHM), the first woman director of CHM, and the first woman division director at Argonne. She is an Argonne Distinguished Fellow Emeritus of the Chemical Sciences and Engineering Division, and has received numerous awards for her work in chemistry and her support of women in science.&lt;ref name="Redacted"/&gt;

==Early life and education==
Marion Thurnauer was born in [[Chattanooga, Tennessee]], later moving to [[Minnesota]]. Her father, [[Hans Thurnauer]] was a [[ceramic engineer]].&lt;ref name=HansThurnaeur&gt;{{cite news|title=In Memoriam, Hans Thurnauer, 1908-2007|url=http://www.electrochem.org/dl/interface/sum/sum07/su07_p20-21_25.pdf|accessdate=27 October 2014|work=Interface|issue=Summer 2007|publisher=The Electrochemical Society|date=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her mother, Lotte Oettinger Thurnauer, died in 1959, while Marion was still young.&lt;ref name=HansThurnaeur/&gt;   One of her aunts, [[Luise Herzberg]], was an [[astrophysicist]]. Thurnaeur credits family interests in science as a formative influence.&lt;ref name = "Redacted"/&gt;

She received her B.A. (1968), M.S. (1969) and Ph.D. (1974) in chemistry, from the [[University of Chicago]].&lt;ref name = "Redacted"/&gt;&lt;ref name=purple&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hunter|first1=C.

Thurnauer credits her future husband, [[Alexander Trifunaci]], with convincing her to study chemistry and learn techniques that could then be applied to biological systems.&lt;ref name=Hinkle&gt;{{cite book|author-last1=Keiter|author-first1=Ellen A.|author-last2=Piocos|author-first2=Elizabeth A.|chapter=Marion Thurnauer, Senior Scientist: A view from a government laboratory|editor-last1=Hinkle|editor-first1=Amber S.|editor-last2=Kocsis|editor-first2=Jody|title=Successful women in chemistry : corporate America's contribution to science|date=2005|publisher=American Chemical Society|location=Washington, DC|isbn=0841239126|pages=111–116}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thurnauer's doctoral thesis advisor was [[Gerhard L. Closs]]. For her thesis work, she studied magnetic interaction in radical pairs using [[electron paramagnetic resonance]] (EPR).   The final experiments for her thesis research were conducted with an electron paramagnetic resonance spectrometer at the [[Argonne National Laboratory]] because equipment at the University of Chicago had been damaged in an explosion.&lt;ref name = "Redacted"/&gt;

== Argonne National Laboratory ==
Thurnauer obtained a postdoctoral position in the Chemistry Division (CHM) of the Argonne National Laboratory in [[Argonne, Illinois]]. There she worked with [[James R. Norris (chemist)|James R. Norris]] and [[Joseph J. Katz]]. In her postdoctorate work, she used [[electron paramagnetic resonance]] (EPR) [[spectroscopy]] to study photochemical energy conversion in natural photosynthesis. She was the first woman to be promoted to a staff position, that of  Assistant Chemist, and for several years was the only female staff scientist in the chemistry division.&lt;ref name = "Redacted" /&gt; From 1993
to 1995 she was the Group Leader for the Photochemical Energy Sciences Group in the Chemistry Division.&lt;ref name=Biography&gt;{{cite web|title=Marion C.

== Women in Science and Technology ==
Thurnauer was awarded the Argonne National Laboratory Pacesetter Award in 1989 for her work in establishing the "Science Careers in Search of Women" conference, an extremely successful program which enables students to learn about technical careers in science and engineering and meet with women working actively in science.&lt;ref name=Holl/&gt;&lt;ref name=Pacesetter&gt;''Graduate School and Beyond: A Panel Discussion from the Conference Science Careers in Search of Women, Waterfall Glen Conference, April 6–7, 1989'', Argonne National Laboratory, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; The first year involved college women, but in ensuing years the program has worked with high school students.&lt;ref name=Hinkle/&gt;

After the second conference, Argonne leadership and women scientists launched the Argonne Women in Science and Technology (WIST) program.&lt;ref name = "Redacted" /&gt; Thurnauer and others emphasized that outreach and internal career development were closely linked, promoting change within the organization as well as without: "Young women could not be brought to Argonne and successfully encouraged to be scientists and engineers if they observed only a few women in relatively lower level positions."&lt;ref name=Hinkle/&gt; Thurnauer served a two-year term (1992-1994) as the Women in Science Program Initiator, a paid 30% appointment, and for several years was a member of the WIST Steering Committee.&lt;ref name=Biography/&gt;

A '''mechanical device test stand''' is one specific type of [[Test bench|test stand]]. It is a facility used to develop, characterize and test mechanical components. The facility allows for the testing of the component and, it offers measurement of several physical variables associated to the functionality of the component. Such components could be electromechanical, motors or tools. The intended use of the test stand is for compliance testing of predetermined desired values and fatigue testing.
A sophisticated mechanical component test stand houses several integrated measurement and control (imc) components, such as sensors, data acquisition devices and actuators to control the component. The sensors measure several physical variables, such as:

* Strain/multi-axial strain 
* [[Stress (mechanics)|Mechanical stress]]
* Rigidity/stiffness
* Angle
* Vibration/oscillation signals

Information gathered from the sensors is processed and logged through the use of data acquisition systems. Actuators allow for attaining a desired state. Test stands for mechanical devices are often custom-built according to the requirements of the customer. They often include a feedback control system.

==Applications for mechanical device test stands==
[[File:Lenkrad-IMG 9917.jpg|thumb|250px|imc steering wheel test stand]]
* Research and Development of components, motors and tools (e.g., the testing of sun roofs, engine hoods, welding equipment. etc.), typically found in factory environments.
* End of production line at an OEM factory. Changing of tested components can take place automatically.

==Mechanical device testing for research and development==

Research and Development (R&amp;D) activities on mechanical components have necessitated sophisticated mechanical component test stands. For example, automobile OEMs or aviation OEMs are usually interested in developing mechanical components that meet the following objectives:
* Provide high durability
* High efficiency
* High performance/quality
* Keep costs down

Consequently, R&amp;D mechanical component test stands perform a variety of exercises including measurement, control and recording of several relevant engine variables.

;Typical tests include:
* Determine efficiency
* Structural analysis
* Determine durability: e.g., aging tests
* Gain further knowledge about the mechanical component
* [[Fourier analysis]]
* Order analysis
* [[Fatigue (material)|Fatigue analysis]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5022">[[File:KleineOrgel.jpg|thumb|280px|''Kleine Orgel'' ("Little Organ")]]
The '''Mühlsteinbrüche''' ("Millstone Quarries") south of [[Jonsdorf]] in the [[Zittau Mountains]] in [[Saxony]] are a region of bizarre rock formations, which have been formed by the quarrying of [[sandstone]] for [[millstone]]s and also by [[weathering]] processes. They are a popular [[hiking]] and [[climbing area]]. An [[educational trail]] runs through the region which has an area of about 35 hectares.

== Location and surrounding area ==
The Mühlsteinbrüche are located south of [[Jonsdorf]] at a height of 480 to 560 metres. To the southwest they are adjoined by the [[Jonsdorfer Felsenstadt]]. About 600 metres to the south is the border with the [[Czech Republic]].

== Geology ==
[[File:DreiTische.jpg|thumb|''Drei Tische'' ("Three Tables")]]
The sandstone in the Mühlsteinbrüche region was formed in the geological age of the [[Middle Turonian]] and, based on its formation, belongs to the Bohemian Cretaceous Basin. It is characterised by several special features. For example, the sandstone, which was formed by sedimentation, has been breached multiple times by [[basalt]]ic and [[phonolitic]] [[intrusion (geology)|intrusions]] as a result of contact with occurrences of [[Tertiary volcanism]] in [[North Bohemia]]. Often, in these cases, the rock has been exposed to thermal changes (contact with [[magma]] and hydrothermal fluids), which has led to [[vitrification]] of the rock (a melting of mineral grains at their grain boundaries). The sandstone retains its porosity, is hardened by the strength of its [[grain structure]] and thus its abrasion resistance is increased.

[[File:Muehlst.jpg|thumb|Schwarzes Loch ("Black Hole")]]
The area of Mühlsteinbrüche has as additional geological feature: its pronounced columnar sandstone. Its best known rock formation is the ''Große und Kleine Orgel'' ("Great and Little Organ"), whose appearance is easily confused with that of columnar [[basalt]]. The columns, which are completely atypical for sandstone, have a diameter of up to 15 centimetres and are bundled vertically on a solid, non-columnar sandstone block. They have been formed by thermal processes as a result of contact with [[magma]]. In 1852 [[Alexander von Humboldt]] sent an artist and two geologists here to study this phenomenon.

== History ==
The use of sandstone in the Zittau Mountains for the production of [[millstone]]s was already under way from the 16th century. The Jonsdorf Mühlsteinbrüche were one of more than 40 quarrying sites in the surrounding region. In 1560, quarrying began in Jonsdorf itself. Over 350 years, sandstone was quarried here and made into millstones with a diameter of up to 2.70 metres. To do this, the millstones were initially hewn out of one piece of rock. From about 1850, millstones were assembled from several pieces as there were no longer any sufficiently large and homogeneous sandstone blocks being quarried. Production was maintained until 1918. The main markets were in [[Russia]] and [[England]]. [[Moscow]] and [[Saint Petersburg]] had their own offices for the millstone trade.
 
In the 1950s, a [[nature trail]] was laid out by friends of nature and local history. From 1990, a restoration of the quarries was begun in order to make them accessible. In 2002, a demonstration workshop was built in the ''Schwarzer Loch'' ("Black Hole"). Today the Mühlsteinbrüche are a major attraction in the Zittau Mountains.

'''Online youth radicalization''' is the process of by which an young individual, or group of people comes to adopt increasingly [[Extremism|extreme]] political, social, or religious ideals and aspirations that reject or undermine the status quo or undermine contemporary ideas and expressions of the nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last = Wilner |first1 = |last2 = Dubouloz |first2 = |last-author-amp = yes |title = Homegrown terrorism and transformative learning: an interdisciplinary approach to understanding radicalization |journal = Global Change, Peace, and Security |volume = 22 |issue = 1 |year = 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As for radicalization, online youth radicalization can be both violent or non-violent.

The phenomenon often referred to as "incitement to [[radicalization]] towards [[violent extremism]]" (or "violent radicalization") has grown in recent years. This is mainly in relation to the Internet in general and [[social media]] in particular. In parallel to the increased attention to [[Online and offline|online]] "incitement to extremism and violence", attempts to prevent this phenomenon have created challenges for [[Freedom of speech|freedom of expression]]. These range from indiscriminate [[Block (Internet)|blocking]], censorship over-reach (affecting both journalists and bloggers), and [[privacy]] intrusions—right through to the suppression or instrumentalisation of media at the expense of independent credibility).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book |title = Youth and Violent Extremism on Social Media: Mapping the Research |last = Alava |first = Séraphin |last2 = Frau-Megs |first2 = Divina |last3 = Hassan |first3 = Ghayda |last-author-amp = yes |publisher = UNESCO |year = 2017 |isbn = |url = http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0026/002603/260382e.pdf |pages = 167 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a quick and easy way to show action after [[Terrorism|terrorist attacks]], political pressure is ease to accuse social media companies of responsibility and call them to do more to prevent online radicalization of young people leading to violent extremism. UNESCO calls for "a policy that is constructed on the basis of facts and evidence, and not founded on hunches—or driven by panic and fearmongering."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = https://en.unesco.org/news/unesco-releases-new-research-youth-and-violent-extremism-social-media |title = UNESCO releases new research on youth and violent extremism on social media |publisher = UNESCO }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cyberspace]] is used to denote the Internet, as a network of networks, and social media as a social network that may combine various Internet platforms and applications to exchange and publish online: the online production of radical (political, social, religious) resources or content, the presence of terrorist or radicalized groups within the social networks, and the participation of young people in radical conversations.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Definitions and approaches ==
There is no consensus definition, broadly speaking "radicalization" refers to a process in which individuals are moved towards beliefs deemed "extreme" by the status quo. Not all processes of radicalization, however, have acts of violence as either their goal or their outcome. Concern is with radicalization processes which intentionally result in violence, and particularly when that violence is terroristic in targeting civilians. Communications—offline and offline—play a part in radicalization processes, along with events and how individuals interpret their life experiences.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Yet distinctions need to be made between communications that may be perceived as "extreme", but which do not rise to the level of constituting criminal incitement or recruitment, and those which advocate for violent acts to be committed. Although scholars emphasize different aspects, there are three main recurring characteristics in the way that they conceptualize specifically violent radicalization.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In this sense, the concept of violent radicalization (or radicalization leading to violent acts) covers an observable process involving the individual person’s&lt;ref&gt;Farhad Khosrokhavar, 2014{{full citation needed|date=February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; search for fundamental meaning, origin and return to a root ideology, the [[Polarization (politics)|polarization]] of the social space and the collective construction of a threatened ideal "us" against "them", where others are dehumanized by a process of scapegoating, a group’s adoption of violence as a legitimate means for the expansion of root [[Ideology|ideologies]] and related oppositional objectives.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Two major schools of theory can be discerned in the reception of Internet and social media. These schools largely originate in [[Old media|pre-digital media,]] but are still being applied (usually implicitly) to the [[Information Age|Internet era]]. The [[Effects-based operations|effects-based]] school perceives the Internet and social media as highly powerful means of communication and propaganda that over-determine other communication tools and processes. Social media are seen as highly effective drivers of propaganda, conspiracy theories and the rise of extremism through de-sensitization which leads to individuals accepting the use of violence. The uses-based school sheds doubts on the structuring effects of social media by [[Empiricism|empirically]] identifying only indirect and limited effects. In this [[paradigm]], "the role of social media in violent radicalization and extremism constitutes a reflection of real offline social ruptures".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Youth and violent extremism ==

=== Specificities of social media ===

==== Chatrooms ====
[[Chat room|Chatrooms]] can be embedded within most Internet-based media. Reports that have looked into the use of chatrooms by violent extremist groups, describe these as the space where atrisk youth without previous exposure would be likely to come across radicalizing religious narratives.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Quilliam, 2014;{{full citation needed|date=February 2018}} Shah, 2012{{full citation needed|date=February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This goes in line with Sageman’s&lt;ref&gt;Sageman’s (2004){{full citation needed|date=February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; emphasis on the role of chatrooms and [[Internet forum|forums]], based on his distinction between websites as passive sources of news and chat rooms as active sources of interaction. According to [[Marc Sageman|Sageman]], "networking is facilitated by discussion forums because they develop communication among followers of the same ideas (experiences, ideas, values), reinforce interpersonal relationships and provide information about actions (tactics, objectives, tutorials)". Chatrooms can also include spaces where extremist people share information such as photos, videos, guides, and manuals.&lt;ref&gt;Sageman, 2008{{full citation needed|date=February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== Facebook ====
Many extremist groups are ideologically and strategically anti-Facebook, but a strong presence still exists on this platform either directly or through supporters.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;Quilliam, 2014{{full citation needed|date=February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Facebook does not seem to be used for direct recruitment or planning, possibly because it has mechanisms of tracking and can link users with real places and specific times. Facebook appears to have been more often used by extremists as a decentralized center for the distribution of information and videos or a way to find like-minded supporters and show support rather than direct recruitment.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; This may be on the possibility that young sympathizers can share information and images and create Facebook groups in a decentralized way.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== Twitter ====
[[Microblogging|Micro-blogging]] sites like Twitter present more advantages for extremist groups because [[traceability]] of the identity and the source of the tweets are harder to achieve, thus increasing the communication potential for recruiters.&lt;ref&gt;Crettiez, 2011;{{full citation needed|date=February 2018}} Quilliam, 2014;{{full citation needed|date=February 2018}} Menkhaus, 2014{{full citation needed|date=February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Analyses of Twitter feeds generated by Islamist violent extremist groups show that they are mostly used for engaging with the opposition and the authorities, in what appear to be tweetclashes that mobilize the two sides, and also used for provocation.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; Through Twitter, extremists can easily comment publicly on international events or personalities, in several languages, enabling the activists to be vocal and timely when mounting campaigns.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== YouTube and other video platforms ====
YouTube has the advantage of being difficult to trace the identity of people posting content, while offering the possibility for users to generate comments and share contents.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; Several researchers have conducted content analyses of YouTube and Facebook extremist discourses and video contents to identify the production features most used, including their [[modus operandi]] and intended effects.&lt;ref&gt;Salem, Reid &amp; Chen, 2008;{{full citation needed|date=February 2018}} Tomomi, 2013{{full citation needed|date=February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies that have focused on the [[rhetoric]]al strategy of extremist groups show the multifaceted use of online resources by extremist groups. That is, they produce "[[hypermedia]] seduction" via the use of visual motifs that are familiar to young people online;&lt;ref&gt;Ganor et al., 2007;{{full citation needed|date=February 2018}} Fighel, 2007;{{full citation needed|date=February 2018}} Raffaello, 2011;{{full citation needed|date=February 2018}} Vergani, 2014{{full citation needed|date=February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and they provide content in several languages, mostly Arabic, English and French using subtitles or audio dubbing, to increase the [[recruitment]] capacity of youth across nations.&lt;ref&gt;Weimann, 2010{{full citation needed|date=February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; These videos provide rich media messaging that combines nonverbal cues and vivid images of events that can evoke [[Psychology|psychological]] and [[Emotion|emotional responses]] as well as violent reactions.&lt;ref&gt;Salem, Reid &amp; Chen, 2008{{full citation needed|date=February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Terrorists capture their attacks on video and disseminate them though the Internet, communicating an image of effectiveness and success. Such videos in turn are used to mobilize and recruit members and sympathizers. Videos also serve as authentication and archive, as they preserve live footage of actual damage and they validate terrorist performance acts.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Uses of Internet and social media by extremist groups ===
The Internet and Social media has numerous advantages for extremist groups using religion as part of a radicalization strategy. The advantages stem from the very nature of Internet and social media channels and the way they are used by extremist groups. These include [[communication channel]]s that are not bound to national [[jurisdiction]]s and that are informal, large group, cheap, decentralized and anonymous.&lt;ref&gt;Hale, 2012;{{full citation needed|date=February 2018}} Neumann 2013{{full citation needed|date=February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This allows terrorists to network across borders and to bypass time and space.&lt;ref&gt;Weimann, 2015{{full citation needed|date=February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, these channels provide networks of recruiters, working horizontally, in all the countries they target due to the transborder nature of the Internet.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Weinmann describes extremist groups’ use of Internet and social media in eight process strategies: "psychological warfare, publicity and propaganda, [[data mining]], [[fundraising]], recruitment and mobilization, networking, information sharing and planning and coordination".&lt;ref&gt;Weimann, 2004{{full citation needed|date=February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conway identifies five-core terrorist uses of the Internet and social media: "information provision, financing, networking, recruitment and information gathering". The ones most relevant to social media and radicalization of young people are information provision, such as profiles of [[Leadership|leaders]], [[manifestos]], publicity and propaganda, and recruitment.&lt;ref&gt;Conway, 2006{{full citation needed|date=February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some studies show that social media enable people to isolate themselves in an ideological niche by seeking and consuming only information consistent with their views,&lt;ref&gt;i.e. confirmation bias&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mohamed, 2007;{{full citation needed|date=February 2018}} Warner, 2010{{full citation needed|date=February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as simultaneously self-identifying with geographically distant international groups of international which, therefore, creates a sense of community beyond borders. This ability to communicate can promote membership and identity quests faster and in more efficient ways than in the "real" [[Social reality|social world]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

While recruitment is a process, and not instantaneous, it is seen in the literature as a phase of radicalization, taking the process to a new level of identification and possible action. Indoctrination is easier post-recruitment and often occurs in specific virtual spaces where the extremist rhetoric is characterized by a clear distinction between "them" (described negatively) and "us" (described positively), and where violent actions are legitimized according to the principle of "no other option available".&lt;ref&gt;Meddaugh &amp; Kay, 2009;{{full citation needed|date=February 2018}} Vergani, 2014{{full citation needed|date=February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; These advantages of Internet and social media open up prospects for extremist groups, by facilitating what used to be referred previously as block recruitment&lt;ref&gt;Oberschall, 1973{{full citation needed|date=February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by substituting group decision to individual decision-making.&lt;ref&gt;Busher, 2015{{full citation needed|date=February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Political radicalization ===
Some reports show that extreme right-wing groups take advantage of the freedom of speech guaranteed by many countries’ legislations,&lt;ref&gt;Dagnes, 2003{{full citation needed|date=February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; to post hateful comments that however do not represent full [[Hate speech|hate-speech]] or [[Crime|illegal acts]].&lt;ref&gt;Barnett, 2005;{{full citation needed|date=February 2018}} Pollock, 2006{{full citation needed|date=February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, these groups seem to mobilize efforts on Internet and social media to convey a more acceptable public image and recruit new members who would otherwise be offended by blatantly [[Racism|racist]] or hate-based discourse.&lt;ref&gt;Gerstenfeld, Grant &amp; Chau-Pu, 2003;{{full citation needed|date=February 2018}} Schafer, Mullins &amp; Box, 2014;{{full citation needed|date=February 2018}} Schmitz, 2016; Simi &amp; Futrell, 2006{{full citation needed|date=February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, the discourse found on [[Stormfront (website)|Stormfront]]&lt;ref&gt;Early supremacist website, launched in 1995{{full citation needed|date=February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; is particularly noteworthy because it clearly shows the transition towards a more "acceptable" form of racist discourse.&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;Meddaugh &amp; Kay, 2009{{full citation needed|date=February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The discourses seem to be less aggressive, even condemning violence and refusing to resort to an incendiary rhetoric. Instead, the discourses that are posted use seemingly scientific or intellectual [[Theory|theories]] about racial differences, in a watered-down version of racist discourse, relying on apparently reliable sources of information that appeal to the general public. More specifically, the racist discourses used by Stormfront relies on a "us" vs. "them" rhetoric, portraying them or ‘the other’ in five ways as: a) [[Tyrant|tyrannical]] (submits white people to rules and laws that serve him, e.g., Jews control the media and the economy); b) manipulator (uses deceit to achieve aims, e.g., [[brainwashing]] children with pro-black school programs); c) [[Genocide|genocidal]] (e.g., [[multiculturalism]] and [[interracial marriage]] are seen as ways to eradicate the white race); d) inferior (e.g., less capacities than white people); and e) a false [[martyr]] (e.g., manipulates history to be seen as a victim).&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;

Authors argue that cyberspace is helping to create a strong extreme [[Right-wing populism|right-wing]] [[collective identity]] and a sense of belonging to a global scale via a process of networking, sharing of information (values, symbols and fears, not just facts), discussion, recruitment and event organization, in similar ways to [[Fundamentalism|religious extremist]] movements.&lt;ref&gt;Alava, 2014;{{full citation needed|date=February 2018}} Bowman-Grieve 2009;{{full citation needed|date=February 2018}} Caiani Parenti, 2011;{{full citation needed|date=February 2018}} Cheng, 2012;{{full citation needed|date=February 2018}} Giorgiou, 2010{{full citation needed|date=February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Exposure to extreme right-wing discourses also seems to lead to a significant radicalization of attitudes among certain individuals from diverse political affiliations.&lt;ref name="auto3"&gt;Biddle, 2015{{full citation needed|date=February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, this was not the case for exposure to extreme left-wing discourses or exposure to moderate media and mixed media (control group), which generally resulted in a decrease of extremist attitudes.&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt; Some researchers argue that spreading the message to a bigger audience and inspiring violence can make the recruitment easier, but there is no evidence that it leads to a full process of violent radicalization or actual acts of violence being committed.&lt;ref&gt;Levin, 2002{{full citation needed|date=February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Reception and influence on youth ===
[[Dounia Bouzar|Bouzar]], Caupenne and Sulayman (2014) present the results of interviews with 160 French families with radicalized (though not violent) children aged mainly between 15 and 21. The vast majority of the young people claimed to have been radicalized through the Internet, and this was the case regardless of their family characteristics and dynamics. The vast majority of the families (80%) did not follow any specific religious beliefs or practices and only 16% belonged to the working class.&lt;ref&gt;Bouzar, Caupenne &amp; Sulayman, 2014{{full citation needed|date=February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wojcieszak&lt;ref&gt;Wojcieszak (2010){{full citation needed|date=February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; analysed [[Cross-sectional study|cross-sectional]] and [[Text corpus|textual data]] obtained from respondents in [[Neo-Nazism|neo-Nazi]] online discussion forums. The author found that "extremism increases with increased [[online participation]], probably as a result of the informational and [[normative]] influences within the online groups". In addition, exposure to different parties/views offline that are dissimilar to the extremist group’s values has in some instances reinforced radical beliefs online.&lt;ref&gt;Wojcieszak, 2010{{full citation needed|date=February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many authors hypothesize potential causation by associating online radicalization with external factors such as: search for [[Identity (social science)|identity]] and meaning, the growing [[Economic inequality|inequalities]] in [[European Union|European]] and other societies, unemployment and fewer opportunities for development especially for [[Minority group|minority youth]], [[Exclusion sociale|exclusion]], discrimination and inequality that are massively used in extremist discourses.&lt;ref&gt;e.g., ATHENA report, 2015;{{full citation needed|date=February 2018}} Schils, 2013;{{full citation needed|date=February 2018}} Umar &amp; Mustapha, 2015{{full citation needed|date=February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Social media and violent radicalization ==

=== In the Arab World ===
The analysis of the profiles of researchers and publications on violent radicalization from the [[Arab world]] reveals the prominence of specialists on [[Islamism|Islamist movements]]. They are, most often, [[humanities]] and [[social science]] researchers and some are specialists in media and public opinion, [[international relations]], or even security. Another specificity of research on violent radicalization in the Arabic-speaking region is the involvement of religious researchers in this field. The main objective of this contribution is part of a state strategy to counter faith advocated by violent [[Political radicalism|radical groups]]. In this logic, radicalization or [[jihadism]] are replaced by the term terrorist in referral to these groups. In other regions, experts use terms such as jihadist [[Salafi movement|Salafism]] or jihadism or violent radicalization. There is a clear tendency among most Arabic-speaking researchers to avoid the use of the word [[Islam]] and its semantic field to denote violent radical groups. This is also why researchers from the region prefer to use the Arabic acronym Daesh or the State Organization instead of the ‘Islamic State.’ Most research published from the Arab world does not focus on the relation between violent radicalization and Internet or social media, nor does it evaluate the effect of prevention or intervention cyberinitiatives.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Arab youth are major consumers of social media networks and especially Facebook, which is one of the top ten most used sites by Arab Internet users, a tendency that quickly found its translation into the Arab political realm.&lt;ref&gt;Gonzalez-Quijano, 2012{{full citation needed|date=February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a study by Mohamed Ibn Rachid Faculty for [[governance]] in the [[United Arab Emirates]], the number of Facebook users in 22 Arab countries increased from 54.5 million in 2013 to 81.3 million in 2014 with a majority being young people.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The study of literature in the region reveals the role played by [[social network]]s, especially Facebook and Twitter, as platforms for collective expression for Arab youth on current issues, conflicts and wars (e.g., Gaza situation in particular).&lt;ref&gt;Salem, Mourtada &amp; Alshaer, 2014{{full citation needed|date=February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Iraq]], for example, young Internet users and [[blog]]gers launched several campaigns on Facebook and Twitter at the beginning of military operations to free the major cities occupied by ISIS (Fallujah and Mosul). In [[Morocco]], other initiatives with the same objective were launched such as the one by Hamzah al-Zabadi on Facebook ( مغاربة_ضد_داعش# ; Moroccans against Daesh), which consisted of sharing all kinds of content (images, texts,etc.) to contradict and challenge [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|ISIS]]’s narratives. The involvement of [[civil society]] actors on the web in the fight against terrorism and violent radicalization in the Arab region remains modest for many reasons including the lack of media [[Policy|policies]] dedicated to this struggle.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== In Asia ===
Researchers in Asia have developed a complex understanding of radicalization as being deeply connected to [[psychosocial]] and economic [[grievance]]s such as poverty and unemployment,&lt;ref&gt;Khalid, &amp; Leghari 2014;{{full citation needed|date=February 2018}} Tadjbakhsh, 2015{{full citation needed|date=February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Social exclusion|marginalization]] through [[Literacy|illiteracy]] and lack of education,&lt;ref&gt;Tadjbakhsh, 2015{{full citation needed|date=February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as admiration for [[Charismatic authority|charismatic leaders]], pursuit of social acceptability and [[psychological trauma]]. These factors are considered by authors to facilitate online radicalization-oriented recruitment, especially among young people, who are more vulnerable and who spend more time online.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

A report by "We Are Social" in 2016 reveals that East Asia and Southeast Asia are the first and second social media markets worldwide, with North America in the third rank. According to the same report, Facebook and [[Facebook Messenger]] are the predominant social and communications tools, followed by Twitter, [[Line (software)|Line]] and [[Skype]]. China is the notable exception as Facebook Messenger is outpaced by far by Chinese social media tools. China presents a very different profile from most countries in its [[mainstream]] social media and networks. American platforms such as Google, [[Yahoo!]], Facebook, Twitter and YouTube have very little penetration due to state restrictions and the strong monopoly of homegrown search engines and Internet platforms in Chinese language.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

There is rising interest among Chinese researchers in examining the relationship between social media and [[Violence|violent]] radicalization.&lt;ref&gt;Tang, 2013{{full citation needed|date=February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research into violent radicalization or [[terrorism in China]] is mainly on radicalization in [[Xinjiang]]. This could be linked to the fact that most of the recent terrorist attacks in China were not perpetrated by local residents, but by outsider violent extremist organizations that seek to separate the Xinjiang area from China.&lt;ref&gt;Feng, 2009;{{full citation needed|date=February 2018}} Li &amp; Zhao; 2015;{{full citation needed|date=February 2018}} Zhang, 2013{{full citation needed|date=February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Terrorist organizations spread their messages via TV, radio and the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;Wo, 2016{{full citation needed|date=February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though there is no empirical evidence linking youth radicalization to online social media, the [[anonymity]] and [[Globalization|transborder]] capacity of such media is seen as a "support for organized terrorist propaganda".&lt;ref&gt;Du, 2016;{{full citation needed|date=February 2018}} Long, 2016;{{full citation needed|date=February 2018}} Sun, 2014{{full citation needed|date=February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Government of China|Chinese government]] has been responding to terrorist attacks by taking down sites, blocking and [[Content-control software|filtering]] content. In return, Chinese government also uses the social media for messaging against terrorism.&lt;ref&gt;Liu, 2016{{full citation needed|date=February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Indonesia]] has an estimated 76 million Indonesians who connect regularly on Facebook, establishing the nation as the fourth largest user of the world, after [[India]], the United States and [[Brazil]]. Indonesia is also the fifth largest user of Twitter, after the United States, Brazil, Japan and the United Kingdom. The Institute for Policy Analysis of Conflict (IPAC) examines how Indonesian extremists use Facebook, Twitter and various mobile phone applications such as [[WhatsApp]] and [[Telegraphy|Telegram]]. In recent research, Lefevre&lt;ref&gt;Lefevre (2014){{full citation needed|date=February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; shows that the use of social media in Indonesia by extremists is progressing. They use social media, such as Facebook and Twitter, to communicate with young people, to train and to fundraise online. Recruitment is done through [[online game]]s, propaganda videos on YouTube and calls to purchase weapons. The proliferation of ISIS propaganda via individual Twitter accounts has raised concerns about the possibility of "[[Lone wolf (terrorism)|lone actor]]" attacks. That being said, the report points out that such attacks are extremely rare in Indonesia.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== In Africa ===
There is little contemporary research on online radicalization in [[Sub-Saharan Africa]]. Yet Africa carries at its heart a powerful extremist group: "[[Boko Haram]]" whose real name is Jama’atu Ahlu-Sunna wal Jihad Adda’wa Li («Group of the People of Sunnah for Preaching and Jihad») since 2002 and has pledged allegiance to the Daesh. The network is less resourceful and financed compared to Daesh, but it seems to have entered in a new era of communication by the use of social media networks, more so since its allegiance to Daesh.&lt;ref&gt;Ould el-Amir, 2015{{full citation needed|date=February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; To spread their principles this terrorist group uses the Internet and adapts Daesh communication strategies to the sub-Saharan African context to spread its propaganda (also in French and English) with more sophisticated videos. By its presence on the most used digital networks (Twitter, [[Instagram]]), Boko Haram breaks with traditional forms of communication in the region such as propaganda videos sent to agencies on flash drives or CD-ROM.&lt;ref&gt;Olivier, 2015{{full citation needed|date=February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Video content analyses has also shown a major shift from long monologues from the leader [[Abubakar Shekau]], that had poor editing and translation, to messages and videos that have increased its attractiveness among sub-Saharan youth. Today, Boko-Haram owns a real communications agency called «al-Urwa Wuqta» (literally «the most trustworthy», «the most reliable way»). Moreover, the group multiplies its activities on Twitter especially via their [[smartphone]]s, as well as through YouTube news channels. Most tweets and comments of the group’s supporters denounce the Nigerian government and call for support for Boko Haram movement. The tweets are written in Arabic at first and then translated and passed on in English and French, which reflect the group’s desire to place itself in the context of what it sees as global jihad. In a recent study conducted in 2015, researchers have shown how Boko Haram related tweets include rejection of the movement by non-members of the organisation.&lt;ref&gt;Varin, 2015{{full citation needed|date=February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Online prevention initiatives ==

=== Alternative narratives ===
Van Eerten, Doosje, Konijn, De Graaf, and De Goede&lt;ref&gt;In press, 2017{{full citation needed|date=February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggest that counter or alternative narratives could be a promising prevention strategy. Some researchers argue that a strong alternative narrative to violent jihadist groups is to convey the message that they mostly harm Muslims.&lt;ref&gt;Archetti, 2012;{{full citation needed|date=February 2018}} Cornish, Lindley-French &amp; York, 2011;{{full citation needed|date=February 2018}} Corman, 2011; Stevens &amp; Neumann, 2009{{full citation needed|date=February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the last decade, the [[Federal government of the United States|United States government]] has set up two online programs against radicalization designed to counter anti-American propaganda and [[misinformation]] from [[al-Qaeda]] or the Islamic state. These programs seek to win the "[[war of ideas]]" by countering self-styled jihadist rhetoric.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[Private sector]] counter-initiatives involve the YouTube Creators for Change with young "ambassadors" mandated to "drive greater awareness and foster productive dialogue around social issues through content creation and speaking engagements";&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/yt/creators-for-change/|title=Creators for Change |via = YouTube|first=|last=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the "redirectmethod.org" pilot initiative to use search queries in order to direct vulnerable young people to online videos of citizen [[Testimony|testimonies]], on-the-ground reports, and religious debates that debunk narratives used for violent recruitement. The initiative avoids "government-produced content and newly or custom created material, using only existing and compelling YouTube content".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://redirectmethod.org/|title=The Redirect Method|website=redirectmethod.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several [[government]]s are opting to invest in primary prevention through education of the public at large, and of young public in particular, via various "innoculatory" tactics that can be grouped under the broad label of Media and Information Literacy (MIL). Based on knowledge about the use of [[Media literacy|MIL]] in other domains, this initiative can be seen, interalia, as a long term comprehensive preventive strategy for reducing the appeal of violent radicalization.&lt;ref&gt;Earnhardt, 2014;{{full citation needed|date=February 2018}} Frau-Meigs, 2011{{full citation needed|date=February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Alternative Narrative Knowledge Hub ===
'''A knowledge hub for alternative narratives''' http://www.idareact.org

The '''Knowledge Hub''' is an online platform whereby different contributions and expertise about specific themes are gathered and inserted in the framework of a synergetic learning process. Hence, I-Dare has launched this knowledge hub in order to be a powerful resource and a virtual point of aggregation for promoting alternative narratives. I-Dare acknowledges the need for a comprehensive approach towards tackling such a multifaceted topic. Here is why the Alternative Narratives Knowledge Hub is organized into several different categories, such as Articipate, research, alternativism, violent extremism and other content relevant to providing alternative narratives.

'''Alternative Narratives''' are needed to balance the current paradigms which rely on intellectually wrong assumptions and perpetuate stereotypes which increase the risks of extremism, hate, and violence and constitute obstacles to intercultural dialogue. Hence, the mission of the knowledge hub is to promote alternative narratives for reducing such risks and dismantle these obstacles. Raising above stereotypes is not an easy task as they are enshrined in the popular culture, in the common discourse and sometimes even in the official discourse. They are so hard to be balanced since they are based on illusory correlations which simplify our representation of the world. In other words, stereotypes are intellectual shortcuts. To be effective, alternative narratives must then be based on facts, data and clear evidence. Their ultimate goal is to convince people to abandon the aforementioned intellectual shortcuts and to base their opinions on solid and proved correlations, not on illusory ones.

=== Media and information literacy ===
MIL has a long tradition of dealing with harmful content and violent representations, including propaganda.&lt;ref&gt;Gerbner, 1998{{full citation needed|date=February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In its early history, MIL was mostly put in place to fight misinformation (particularly in advertising) by developing critical skills about the media. By the 1980s, MIL also introduced cultural and creative skills to use the media in an empowering way, with active pedagogies.&lt;ref&gt;Hobbs &amp; Jensen, 2009;{{full citation needed|date=February 2018}} Potter, 2013{{full citation needed|date=February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the years 2000, MIL has enlarged the media definition to incorporate the Internet and social media, adding issues related to [[Ethics|ethical]] uses of online media to the traditional debates over harmful content and harmful behavior and aligning them more with the perspectives that consider issues of gratifications of media users.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

|News and entertainment media give disproportionate attention to social media as an explanation of violent radicalization, to the detriment of other explanations (religious strife, alienation, geopolitics of terror, racism and segregation, youth unemployment etc.).
|States and social media platforms operate a series of counter-measures ranging from censorship to counter-narratives and education strategies.
|Lack of capacity for researchers to engage with theory and empirical research
|-
|An alarmist representation of violent radicalization can lead to politics of fear and of fear-mongering by various interested parties, and create a chilling effect on dissent and critical expression.
|There are questions about strategies like blocking of access and filtering content, because there is no clear evidence about the effectiveness of these steps. The impact of online surveillance on radicalization is complicated to research, and is barely covered in the literature.
|Lack of interdisciplinary collaboration
|-
|The spread of stereotypes transforms the "other" into a potential enemy and can affect the way minorities are viewed and view themselves.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
|There seems to be a developing trend for online counter-speech that challenges extremist representations and hate speech. There is less evidence of alternative narratives that acknowledge feelings of powerlessness and alienation, and which propose non-violent ways to address perceived or real grievances. It is also rare to find references to the value of preserving the independence of civil society and media in regard to multi-stakeholderengagement in countering violent narratives.
|Lack of research on the impact of censorship, surveillance, counter-speech and Media and Information Literacy
|-
|
|Education-centered solutions show few initiatives that have been documented and assessed for their efficacy. Many Media and Information Literacy (MIL) resources designed to be used by teachers in a classroom setting are focused on critical thinking, on debunking plot theory, "fake news" and rumors; and on extolling fact-checking. But their impact in terms of reducing risks of online violent radicalization is still not clear.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== International human rights standards ==
{| class="wikitable"
|+'''Key international human rights standards to serve as a benchmark for approaching violent extremism'''
|'''The [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights|International Covenant of Civil and Political Rights]] (ICCPR)'''
|Foregrounds the protection of freedom of expression in Article 19. The Covenant also recognizes that certain exceptional speech falls outside of free expression. Article 20 calls for prohibitions on "propaganda for war", and on "any advocacy of national, racial or religious hatred that constitutes incitement to discrimination, hostility or violence". In Article 19 of the ICCPR, certain expression may be limited by law—if necessary—for the purpose of protection of personal reputation, national security, public order, public health or public morals. All these provisions have a bearing on expression in relation to violent radicalization. General Comment No. 34 of the UN Human Rights Committee emphasizes that Article 20, on compulsory restrictions, has to be interpreted in the context of Article 19. Overall, it underlines that the norm is freedom, and that any restrictions should be exceptional and subject to necessity and proportionality.
|-
|'''The Rabat Plan of Action on the prohibition of advocacy of national, racial or religious hatred that constitutes incitement to discrimination, [[hostility]] or violence'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.un.org/en/preventgenocide/adviser/pdf/Rabat_draft_outcome.pdf]{{dead link|date=March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
|The Rabat Plan was developed in 2012 by the UN’s Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights. It cautions us against illegitimate restrictions of speech based on purported implementation of ICCPR standards. The Rabat Plan proposes a nuanced approach to assessing expressions of hatred in terms of whether they really incite harm. This approach suggests that restriction should only be considered in terms of an assessment of (a) context of effect (the intent and likelihood), (b) the status of the speaker, (c) the specific content, (d) the reach of the expression, and (e) the actual imminent likelihood of resulting harm. This calls on us to use our heads, not our hearts, in reacting to the relationship of expression to the issue of violent radicalization.
|-
|'''The United Nations principles'''
|There is recognition by regional and UN rapporteurs that speech can be "offensive, shocking and disturbing", without necessarily constituting a threat to national security, or hatred that incites harms, or propaganda for war.

In October 2015, [[UNESCO]]’s Executive Board adopted a decision on UNESCO’s role in promoting education as a tool to prevent violent extremism.&lt;ref&gt;Decision 46 adopted at the 197th session of UNESCO’s Executive Board (197 EX/Decision 46) http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002351/235180e.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Piero Magni''' ([[Genoa]], December 22, 1898 - April 17, 1988) was an [[Italy|Italian]] aeronautical engineer.  He was heavily involved with the [[National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics]] later in his career.

Thanks to some of his intuitions, he has been the precursor of some devices extremely actual nowadays, like the variable incidence wings, the development of the [[Canard (aeronautics)|canard]] wings or  monoplane aircraft with the [[wing]] held by a single [[King post|post]]. His activity has not been limited to the design, becoming also an entrepreneur, establishing a firm initially dealing with the manufacture under license of [[Glider (sailplane)|gliders]], and then taking charge of the audit of aircraft for the [[Regia Aeronautica]]. He designed the Vittoria 1924 sport plane.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1925/1925%20-%200566.html?tracked=1&lt;/ref&gt;

He succeeded also in manufacturing some of his designed aircraft characterized by his designed innovative features. On that sphere he experimented the most important one, a patent of a particular [[cowling]] to be applied on a [[radial engine]], that allowed to remarkably increase the aircraft aerodynamics penetration and allowing at the same time an efficient system of temperature regulation of the aircraft itself. This project, known as [[Anello Magni]], has been further developed by the [[National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics]], becoming known as [[NACA cowling]]

Also his activity in the publishing sector are worth mentioning, either as writer of technical books, either as director of “L’Aeronautica”, supplement of the fortnightly magazine of the fascist aviation  “L’Ala d’Italia”.

A '''quality control system (QCS)''' refers to a system used to measure and control the quality of moving sheet processes on-line as in the paper produced by a paper machine. Generally, a control system is concerned with measurement and control of one or multiple properties in time in a single dimension. A QCS is designed to continuously measure and control the material properties of the moving sheet in two dimensions: in the machine direction (MD) and the cross-machine direction (CD).  The ultimate goal is maintaining a good and homogenous quality and meeting users' economic goals.A basic quality measurement system generally includes [[Basis weight of paper|basis weight]] and moisture profile measurements and in addition average basis weight of the paper web and moisture control related to these variables. Caliper is also one of the basic measurements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Paper Machine Quality Control Systems - Volume 1: Measurement Systems and Product Variability | last=Quality Control Systems Education Common Interest Group of the Process Control Division | publisher=Tappi Organization | year=2012 | isbn=978-1595101921}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
   
Other commonly used continuous measurements include: ash content, color, brightness, smoothness and gloss, coat weight, formation], porosity, fiber orientation, and surface properties (topography).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Strategic Automation for Intelligent Papermaking | first=Seyhan | last=Nuyan | publisher=Valmet Corporation | year=1997 | isbn=951-95881-2-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

QCS is used in [[paper machine]]s, board machines, [[Tissue paper|tissue]] machines, pulp drying machines, and other plastic or metal film processes

In modern systems QCS applications can be embedded to [[distributed control system]]s.

== Sensor platform ==
Sensors measuring the paper quality (online meters) are attached to a sensor platform that move across the web guided by the scanner beam. A typical crossing time for a sensor platform is 10–30 s (an 8 m web, 60&amp;nbsp;cm/s). The sensor platform scans across the paper web and continuously measures paper characteristics from edge to edge. It can also be directed and stopped to a specific, fixed point on the web to measure the machine-direction (MD) variation at a single point.

== Scanner beam ==
The QCS scanner beam is an essential part of a QCS system. Wide machines and accurate profile calculations require beam stability and accuracy of mechanical movement. As high accuracy in demanding and variable conditions is required, the sensitive sensors must be securely fastened. The most important goal is maintaining the exact respective position of the upper and lower measurement platforms in relation to their distance from each other, in MD and in CD . This is achieved through a robust construction and by reducing the effects of temperature and other environmental effects and through a moving mechanism with minimized backlash of the measurement platform.

Usually the scanner beam also contains all the cables and the air, cooling liquid and protection gas pipes. The base of the scanner beam contains elements that dampen vertical vibration.

== Variables to be measured ==
A basic quality measurement system generally includes [[Basis weight of paper|basis weight]] and moisture profile measurements and in addition average basis weight of the paper web and moisture control related to these variables. Caliper is also one of the basic measurements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Paper Machine Quality Control Systems - Volume 1: Measurement Systems and Product Variability | last=Quality Control Systems Education Common Interest Group of the Process Control Division | publisher=Tappi Organization | year=2012 | isbn=978-1595101921}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
   
Other commonly used continuous measurements include: ash content, color, brightness, smoothness and gloss, coat weight, formation], porosity, fiber orientation, and surface properties (topography).

== Measurement process  ==
Online sensors are set on the scanner beam to scan across the web. Typical crossing time of the web in new systems is 10–30 s (8m web, 60&amp;nbsp;cm/s). If the web speed is 1200 m/min and web width 8.5 m, the web moves 280 m during a scan, and the sensor moves the same distance diagonally across the web. The measurements are taken on the diagonal line and act as basis for profile (machine and cross-direction) and variation calculations. This value is subject to integration depending on the machine speed. If the measurement signal sampling frequency is in size range 2000/s, then the smallest measurement element is about 0.2&amp;nbsp;cm in cross-direction. The measurement data is integrated to eliminate a small-scale formation variation from the measurement result. 

The measurement value is averaged so that each sensor gives one measurement value per one data box which is typically from 5 mm to one centimeter of web width. For a 1 meter wide web, for instance, 100 - 200 measurement values are taken. These measurement values from a single scan (profile points) are called 'raw profiles'. In modern quality control systems, the width of these data boxes can be changed, and accurate profiles can be formed using several thousands profile data boxes.

Typically, the sensor's output is the instantaneous value, the profile average value and the complete profile.

== Sensor requirements ==
The requirements for an ideal paper machine online sensor include the following: 
the sensor is calibrated to a natural constant during the measurement; 
the sensor and the related electronics include fault diagnostics; 
digital processing of the signal is possible from the start without destroying the possibility of analyzing large frequency components; 
the sensor system does not disturb the production; 
the measurements are performed real-time and can be adjusted without delays; 
the measurement concerns the entire production, not just small sample values. 
It must be possible to distinguish between the machine-directional and cross-directional deviation and the residual deviation as the control system handles these three deviations separately and in different ways. The earlier systems calculated a long-term average profile to filter the profile. As several quality profiles can be adjusted automatically it is important to get the right profile data with high resolution quickly to the control system. This is especially important during changes, after breaks and during grade changes. In advanced systems, algorithms are used to calculate the profile data.

[[File:QD S.jpg|thumb|Colloidal quantum dots irradiated with a UV light. Different sized quantum dots emit different color light due to quantum confinement.]]

A '''quantum dot display''' is a [[display device]] that uses [[quantum dots]] (QD), semiconductor [[nanocrystal|nanocrystals]] which can produce pure monochromatic red, green, and blue light.

''Photo-emissive'' quantum dot particles are used in a QD layer which converts the backlight to emit pure basic colors; this improves display brightness and color gamut by reducing light losses and color crosstalk in RGB color filters. This technology is used in [[LED-backlit LCD]]s, though it is applicable to other display technologies which use color filters, such as white or blue/UV OLED.

''Electro-emissive'' or ''electroluminiscent'' quantum dot displays are an experimental type of new display based on quantum-dot light-emitting diodes (QLED, QD-LED; also  EL-QLED, ELQD, QDEL). These displays are similar to [[active-matrix organic light-emitting diode]] (AMOLED) and [[MicroLED]] displays, in that light would be produced directly in each pixel by applying electric current to inorganic nano-particles. QD-LED displays could support large, flexible displays and would not degrade as readily as OLEDs, making them good candidates for [[flat-panel TV]] screens, [[digital camera]]s, [[mobile phone]]s and [[handheld game console]]s.&lt;ref name="New_Scientist"&gt;[https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn13023-quantumdot-displays-could-outshine-their-rivals/ Quantum-dot displays could outshine their rivals], New Scientist, 10 December 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Evident Technologies sub"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.evidenttech.com/applications/displays.html|title=Quantum Dot Electroluminescence|author=|date=|website=evidenttech.com|accessdate=3 April 2018|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091216060417/http://www.evidenttech.com/applications/displays.html|archivedate=16 December 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.technologyreview.com/s/405755/nanocrystal-displays/|title=Nanocrystal Displays|first=Kevin|last=Bullis|date=|website=MIT Technology Review|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2019, all commercial products, such as LCD TVs using quantum dots and branded as ''QLED'', use ''photo-emissive'' particles. ''Electro-emissive'' QD-LED TVs exist in laboratories only.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.etnews.com/20161018200003|title=Next Samsung Electronics’ QLED TV’s Name to Be SUHD QLED TV|first=|last=www.etnews.com|date=|website=etnews.com|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cnet.com/news/how-qled-tv-could-help-samsung-finally-beat-lgs-oleds/|title=How QLED TV could help Samsung finally beat LG's OLEDs|author=|date=30 June 2016|website=cnet.com|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Samsung QLED TV 8K - 75 inches - 2018-11-02.jpg|thumb|Samsung QLED TV 8K - 75 inches]]

The idea of using quantum dots as a light source emerged in the 1990s. Early applications included imaging using QD infrared photodetectors, [[light emitting diode]]s and single-color light emitting devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1117/12.382121|date=2000|author=R. Victor|author2=K. Irina|title=Electron and photon effects in imaging devices utilizing quantum dot infrared photodetectors and light emitting diodes|volume=3948|pages=206–219|journal=Proceedings of SPIE}}&lt;/ref&gt; Starting from early 2000, scientists started to realize the potential of developing quantum dot for light sources and displays.&lt;ref name=bul&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2009|author=P.

QDs are both ''photo-emissive'' ([[photoluminescent]]) and ''electro-emissive'' ([[electroluminescent]]) allowing them to be readily incorporated into new emissive display architectures.&lt;ref name="Nanoco Technologies sub"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nanocotechnologies.com/content/CommercialApplications/QDDisplays.aspx|title=Display - Nanoco Technologies|author=|date=|website=www.nanocotechnologies.com|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Quantum dots naturally produce monochromatic light, so they are more efficient than white light sources when color filtered and allow more saturated colors that reach nearly 100% of [[Rec. 2020]] color gamut.&lt;ref name=creol_rec2020&gt;http://lcd.creol.ucf.edu/Publications/2015/oe-23-18-23680.pdf Ruidong Zhu, Zhenyue Luo, Haiwei Chen, Yajie Dong, and Shin-Tson Wu.

A widespread practical application is using quantum dot enhancement film (QDEF) layer to improve the [[LED-backlit LCD|LED backlighting in LCD TVs]]. Light from a [[Light-emitting diode#Blue and_ultraviolet|blue LED]] backlight is converted by QDs to relatively pure red and green, so that this combination of blue, green and red light incurs less blue-green crosstalk and light absorption in the color filters after the LCD screen, thereby increasing useful light throughput and providing a better [[color gamut]]. 

The first manufacturer shipping TVs of this kind was [[Sony]] in 2013 as ''Triluminos'', Sony's trademark for the technology.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20130308100416/https://blog.sony.com/press/sony-announces-2013-bravia-tvs/ Sony BRAVIA TV with ''Triluminos'' technology]&lt;/ref&gt; At the [[Consumer Electronics Show]] 2015, [[Samsung Electronics]], [[LG Electronics]], [[TCL Corporation]] and Sony showed QD-enhanced LED-backlighting of LCD TVs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://spectrum.ieee.org/tech-talk/consumer-electronics/audiovideo/ces-2015-placing-bets-on-the-new-tv-technologies IEEE Spectrum: ''CES 2015 - Placing bets on the New TV Technologies.'' 7 January, 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnet.com/news/lg-leaps-quantum-dot-rivals-with-new-tv/|title=LG leaps quantum dot rivals with new TV|author=|date=16 December 2014|website=cnet.com|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.oled-info.com/ultra-slim-lcds-and-quantum-dots-enhanced-leds-enter-market|title=Ultra-slim LCDs and quantum-dots enhanced LEDs enter the market - OLED-Info|author=|date=|website=www.oled-info.com|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the CES 2017, Samsung rebranded their 'SUHD' TVs as 'QLED'; later in April 2017, Samsung formed the QLED Alliance with [[Hisense]] and [[TCL Corporation|TCL]] to produce and market QD-enhanced TVs.&lt;ref name=qled_alliance&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.flatpanelshd.com/news.php?subaction=showfull&amp;id=1493202792|title=Samsung, Hisense &amp; TCL form 'QLED Alliance' to take on OLED - FlatpanelsHD|author=|date=|website=www.flatpanelshd.com|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nanosysinc.com/dot-color-archive/2017/4/18/welcome-to-the-qled-era|title=QLED Alliance Kicks Off in Beijing|author=|date=|website=nanosysinc.com|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Quantum dot color filters ===
{{anchor|Photo-emissive color filters|QDCF}}
'QDCF' LED-backlit LCDs would use QD film or ink-printed QD layer with red/green sub-pixel patterned quantum dots, aligned to precisely match the red and green subpixels; blue subpixels can be transparent to pass through the pure blue LED backlight, or can be made with blue patterned quantum dots in case of UV-LED backlight. This configuration effectively replaces passive color filters, which incur substantial losses by filtering out 2/3 of passing light, with photo-emissive QD structures, improving power efficiency and/or peak brightness, and enhancing color purity.&lt;ref name=pid_samsungdisplay&gt;{{cite web|url=https://pid.samsungdisplay.com/en/learning-center/white-papers/quantum-dot-technology|title=Quantum Dots: Solution for a Wider Color Gamut|author=|date=|website=samsungdisplay.com|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=creol_qd_2017/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.displaydaily.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=51888:the-next-step-for-quantum-dots&amp;catid=152:display-daily|title=DisplayDaily|first=Ken|last=Werner|date=|website=www.displaydaily.com|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because quantum dots depolarize the light, output polarizer (the analyzer) needs to be moved behind the color filter and embedded in-cell of the LCD glass; this would improve viewing angles as well. In-cell arrangement of the analyzer and/or the polarizer would also reduce depolarization effects in the LC layer, increasing contrast ratio. To reduce self-excitement of QD film and to improve efficiency, the ambient light can be blocked using traditional color filters, and reflective polarizers can direct light from QD filters towards the viewer. As only blue or UV light passes through the liquid crystal layer, it can be made thinner, resulting in faster [[Response time (technology)|pixel response times]].&lt;ref name=creol_qd_2017&gt;[http://lcd.creol.ucf.edu/Publications/2017/IEEE%20jstqe-1900611.pdf Haiwei Chen, Juan He, and Shin-Tson Wu.

===Active-matrix light-emitting diodes===
{{seealso|AMOLED|MicroLED|LED display|}}
AMQLED displays will use electroluminescent QD nanoparticles functioning as [[Light-emitting diode#Quantum dot LEDs|Quantum-dot-based LEDs]] (QD-LEDs or QLEDs) arranged in an [[active matrix]] array. Rather than requiring a separate LED backlight for illumination and TFT LCD to control the brightness of color primaries, these QLED displays would natively control the light emitted by individual color subpixels,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trustedreviews.com/opinions/what-is-qled-the-future-of-tv-tech-explained#s3WOjf6fzwFBPchs.99|title=What is QLED?

The structure of a QD-LED is similar to the basic design of an OLED. The major difference is that the light emitting devices are quantum dots, such as [[cadmium selenide]] (CdSe) nanocrystals. A layer of quantum dots is sandwiched between layers of electron-transporting and hole-transporting organic materials. An applied electric field causes electrons and holes to move into the quantum dot layer, where they are captured in the quantum dot and recombine, emitting photons.&lt;ref name=bul/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2002|author=Seth Coe|author2=Wing-Keung Woo|author3=Moungi Bawendi|author4=Vladimir Bulovic|title=Electroluminescence from single monolayers of nanocrystals in molecular organic devices|volume=420|pmid=12490945|issue=6917|pages=800–803|journal=Nature|doi=10.1038/nature01217}}&lt;/ref&gt; The demonstrated [[color gamut]] from QD-LEDs exceeds the performance of both LCD and OLED display technologies.&lt;ref name=bul3/&gt;

==Optical properties of quantum dots==
Performance of QDs is determined by the size and/or composition of the QD structures. Unlike simple atomic structures, a quantum dot structure has the unusual property that energy levels are strongly dependent on the structure's size. For example, [[cadmium selenide|CdSe]] quantum dot light emission can be tuned from red (5&amp;nbsp;nm diameter) to the violet region (1.5&amp;nbsp;nm dot). The physical reason for QD coloration is the [[quantum confinement effect]] and is directly related to their [[energy level]]s. The [[bandgap energy]] that determines the energy (and hence color) of the fluorescent light is inversely proportional to the square of the size of quantum dot. Larger QDs have more energy levels that are more closely spaced, allowing the QD to emit (or absorb) photons of lower energy (redder color). In other words, the emitted photon energy increases as the dot size decreases, because greater energy is required to confine the semiconductor excitation to a smaller volume.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=Bahaa E. A. |last1=Saleh|first2=Malvin Carl |last2=Teich|title=Fundamentals of Photonics|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=Qfeosgu08u8C |p=498}}|date=5 February 2013|publisher=Wiley|isbn=978-1-118-58581-8 |p=498}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Newer quantum dot structures employ [[indium]] instead of [[cadmium]], as the latter is not exempted for use in lighting by the [[European Commission]] [[RoHS]] directive.&lt;ref name=pid_samsungdisplay/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://optics.org/news/7/6/8|title=EU report sends mixed message on cadmium quantum dots|first=SPIE Europe|last=Ltd|date=|website=optics.org|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

QD-LEDs are characterized by pure and saturated emission colors with narrow [[bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]], with FWHM ([[full width at half maximum]]) in the range of 20-40 nm.&lt;ref name=bul/&gt;&lt;ref name=creol_qd_2017/&gt; Their emission wavelength is easily tuned by changing the size of the quantum dots. Moreover, QD-LED offer high color purity and durability combined with the efficiency, flexibility, and low processing cost of comparable organic light-emitting devices. QD-LED structure can be tuned over the entire visible wavelength range from 460&amp;nbsp;nm (blue) to 650&amp;nbsp;nm (red) (the human eye can detect light from 380 to 750&amp;nbsp;nm). The emission wavelengths have been continuously extended to UV and NIR range by tailoring the chemical composition of the QDs and device structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kwak|first=Jeonghun|last2=Lim|first2=Jaehoon|last3=Park|first3=Myeongjin|last4=Lee|first4=Seonghoon|last5=Char|first5=Kookheon|last6=Lee|first6=Changhee|date=2015-06-10|title=High-Power Genuine Ultraviolet Light-Emitting Diodes Based On Colloidal Nanocrystal Quantum Dots|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.nanolett.5b00392|journal=Nano Letters|volume=15|issue=6|pages=3793–3799|doi=10.1021/acs.nanolett.5b00392|issn=1530-6984|pmid=25961530}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Supran|first=Geoffrey J.|last2=Song|first2=Katherine W.|last3=Hwang|first3=Gyu Weon|last4=Correa|first4=Raoul E.|last5=Scherer|first5=Jennifer|last6=Dauler|first6=Eric A.|last7=Shirasaki|first7=Yasuhiro|last8=Bawendi|first8=Moungi G.|last9=Bulović|first9=Vladimir|date=2015-02-01|title=High-Performance Shortwave-Infrared Light-Emitting Devices Using Core–Shell (PbS–CdS) Colloidal Quantum Dots|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/adma.201404636/abstract|journal=Advanced Materials|language=en|volume=27|issue=8|pages=1437–1442|doi=10.1002/adma.201404636|issn=1521-4095}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fabrication process==

Quantum dots are solution processable and suitable for wet processing techniques. The two major fabrication techniques for QD-LED are called phase separation and contact-printing.&lt;ref name=bul2&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2005|display-authors=4|author=Coe-Sullivan, Seth|author2=Steckel, Jonathan S.|author3=Kim, LeeAnn|author4=Bawendi, Moungi G.|author5=Bulovic, Vladimir|title=Method for fabrication of saturated RGB quantum dot light emitting devices|volume=5739|pages=108–115|journal=Progress in Biomedical Optics and Imaging|doi=10.1117/12.590708}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Phase separation===

Phase separation is suitable for forming large-area ordered QD monolayers. A single QD layer is formed by spin casting a mixed solution of QD and an organic semiconductor such as TPD (N,N′-Bis(3-methylphenyl)-N,N′-diphenylbenzidine). This process simultaneously yields QD monolayers self-assembled into hexagonally close-packed arrays and places this monolayer on top of a co-deposited contact. During [[solvent]] drying, the QDs phase separate from the organic under-layer material (TPD) and rise towards the film's surface. The resulting QD structure is affected by many parameters: solution concentration, solvent ration, QD size distribution and QD aspect ratio. Also important is QD solution and organic solvent purity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2005|display-authors=4|author=Coe-Sullivan, Seth|author2=Steckel, Jonathan S.|author3=Woo, Wing-Keung|author4=Bawendi, Moungi G.|author5=Bulovic, Vladimir|title=Large-Area Ordered Quantum Dot Monolayers via Phase Separation During Spin-Casting|volume=15|pages=1117–1124|journal=Advanced Functional Materials|url=http://www.rle.mit.edu/organic/documents/LargeAreaQDMonolayers-AdvFuncMater2005.pdf|doi=10.1002/adfm.200400468|issue=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although phase separation is relatively simple, it is not suitable for display device applications. Since spin-casting does not allow lateral patterning of different sized QDs (RGB), phase separation cannot create a multi-color QD-LED. Moreover, it is not ideal to have an organic under-layer material for a QD-LED; an organic under-layer must be homogeneous, a constraint which limits the number of applicable device designs.

===Contact printing===

The contact printing process for forming QD thin films is a solvent-free water-based suspension method, which is simple and cost efficient with high throughput. During the process, the device structure is not exposed to solvents. Since charge transport layers in QD-LED structures are solvent-sensitive organic thin films, avoiding solvent during the process is a major benefit. This method can produce RGB patterned electroluminescent structures with 1000 ppi (pixels-per-inch) resolution.&lt;ref name=bul3&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2008|display-authors=4|author=Kim, LeeAnn|author2=Anikeeva, Polina O.|author3=Coe-Sullivan, Seth|author4=Steckel, Jonathan S.|author5=Bulovic, Vladimir|title=Contact Printing of Quantum Dot Light-Emitting Devices|volume=8|pmid=19053797|issue=12|pages=4513–4517|journal=Nano Letters|doi=10.1021/nl8025218}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The overall process of contact printing:

* [[Polydimethylsiloxane]] (PDMS) is molded using a silicon master.
* Top side of resulting PDMS stamp is coated with a thin film of [[parylene]]-c, a [[Chemical vapor deposition|chemical-vapor deposited]] (CVD) aromatic organic polymer.
* [[Parylene]]-c coated stamp is inked via spin-casting of a solution of colloidal QDs suspended in an organic [[solvent]].{{contradict-inline|date=December 2015}} 
* After the solvent evaporates, the formed QD monolayer is transferred to the substrate by contact printing.

The array of quantum dots is manufactured by self-assembly in a process known as [[spin casting]]: a solution of quantum dots in an organic material is poured onto a substrate, which is then set spinning to spread the solution evenly.

Contact printing allows fabrication of multi-color QD-LEDs. A QD-LED was fabricated with an emissive layer consisting of 25-[[µm]] wide stripes of red, green and blue QD monolayers. Contact printing methods also minimize the amount of QD required, reducing costs.&lt;ref name=bul3/&gt;

==Comparison==

Nanocrystal displays would render as much as a 30% increase in the visible spectrum, while using 30 to 50% less power than LCDs, in large part because nanocrystal displays wouldn't need backlighting. QD LEDs are 50-100 times brighter than CRT and LC displays, emitting 40,000&amp;nbsp;[[Candela|cd]]/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. QDs are dispersable in both aqueous and non-aqueous solvents, which provides for printable and flexible displays of all sizes, including large area TVs. QDs can be inorganic, offering the potential for improved lifetimes compared to OLED (however, since many parts of QD-LED are often made of organic materials, further development is required to improve the functional lifetime.) In addition to OLED displays, pick-and-place [[MicroLED|microLED displays]] are emerging as competing technologies to nanocrystal displays.

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:QD LED color coordiations.JPG|thumb|Quantum dot light emitting diode color boundary]] --&gt;
Other advantages include better saturated green colors, manufacturability on polymers, thinner display and the use of the same material to generate different colors.

One disadvantage is that blue quantum dots require highly precise timing control during the reaction, because blue quantum dots are just slightly above the minimum size. Since [[sunlight]] contains roughly equal luminosities of red, green and blue across the entire spectrum, a display also needs to produce roughly equal luminosities of red, green and blue to achieve [[White point|pure white]] as defined by [[CIE Standard Illuminant D65]]. However, the blue component in the display can have relatively lower color purity and/or precision ([[dynamic range]]) in comparison to green and red, because the human eye is three to five times less sensitive to blue in daylight conditions according to CIE [[luminosity function]].

The R-46 concept was to launch a very large [[hydrogen bomb]] into orbit as a [[Fractional Orbital Bombardment System|fractional orbital bombardment system]] (FOBS).  The existence of the system was alluded to in a speech by then [[Soviet Premier]] [[Nikita Khrushchev]] in 1961.  The design was not developed, however, and the FOBS concept was abandoned as part of [[SALT II]].

The '''rapid anti-personnel minefield breaching system''' or '''RAMBS II''' is a British [[rifle grenade]] used to breach obstacles and clear [[minefield]]s. It is designed to replace the [[Bangalore torpedo]], offering a more effective and flexible alternative. When deployed, the RAMBS II will clear a path 60 metres long and 0.6 metres wide, compared to the Bangalore's cleared area that is 15 metres long and 1 metre wide.

==Scope of a Safety Engineer==

The scope of a safety engineer is to perform their professional functions. Safety engineering professionals must have education, training and experience in a common body of knowledge. They need to have a fundamental knowledge of [[physics]], [[chemistry]], [[biology]], [[physiology]], [[statistics]], [[mathematics]], [[computer science]], [[engineering mechanics]], [[industrial processes]], [[business]], [[communication]] and [[psychology]]. Professional safety studies include [[industrial hygiene]] and [[toxicology]], design of [[engineering hazard control]]s, [[fire protection]], [[ergonomics]], system and [[process safety]], [[system safety]],  safety and health program management, [[accident investigation]] and analysis, [[product safety]], [[construction safety]], education and training methods, measurement of [[safety performance]], [[human behavior]], [[environmental safety and health]], and safety, health and [[environmental law]]s, regulations and standards. Many safety engineers have backgrounds or advanced study in other disciplines, such as management and business administration, engineering, [[system engineering]] / [[industrial engineering]], [[requirements engineering]], [[reliability engineering]], [[Maintenance, repair and operations|maintenance]], [[human factors]], operations, education, physical and [[social science]]s and other fields. Others have advanced study in safety. This extends their expertise beyond the basics of the safety engineering profession.

==Functions of a Safety Engineer==

The major areas relating to the protection of people, property and the environment are:


==Personality and role==

Oddly enough, personality issues can be paramount in a safety engineer. They must be personally pleasant, intelligent, and ruthless with themselves and their organization. In particular, they have to be able to "sell" the failures that they discover, as well as the attendant expense and time needed to correct them. They can be the messengers of bad news.

Safety engineers have to be ruthless about getting facts from other engineers. It is common for a safety engineer to consider software, chemical, electrical, mechanical, procedural, and training problems in the same day. Often the facts can be very uncomfortable as many safety related issues point towards mediocre management systems or worse, questionable business ethics.

==Teamwork==

It's difficult and expensive to retrofit safety into an unsafe system.  To prevent safety problems, an organization should therefore treat safety as an early design and "architecture" activity, using the principles of [[Inherent safety]], rather than as a "paperwork requirement" to be cleaned up after the real design is done.

Safety engineers also must work in a team that includes other engineering specialties, quality assurance, quality improvement, regulatory compliance specialists, educators and lawyers.

Subpar safety and quality problems often indicate underlying deficiencies in an organization's goals, recruitment, succession, training, management systems and business culture.

Safety often works well in a true matrix-management organization, in which safety is a managed discipline integrated into a project plan.

[[File:Cahora Bassa (HVDC) - KNP - 001.jpg|thumb|HVDC SWER power line in [[Cahora Bassa (HVDC)|Cahora Bassa]]]]

'''Single-wire earth return''' ('''SWER''') or '''single-wire ground return''' is a [[single-wire transmission line]] which supplies [[single-phase electric power|single-phase]] [[electric power]] from an [[electrical grid]] to remote areas at low cost. Its distinguishing feature is that the [[Ground (electricity)|earth]] (or sometimes a body of water) is used as the return path for the current, to avoid the need for a second wire (or ''[[Ground and neutral|neutral wire]]'') to act as a return path.

Single-wire earth return is principally used for [[rural electrification]], but also finds use for larger isolated loads such as water pumps. It is also used for [[high-voltage direct current]] over [[submarine power cable]]s. Electric single-phase railway traction, such as [[light rail]], uses a very similar system. It uses resistors to earth to reduce hazards from rail voltages, but the primary return currents are through the rails.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Electric Traction - Return|url=http://www.railway-technical.com/etracp.shtml|publisher=Railway Technical Web Pages|accessdate=27 April 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070429132542/http://www.railway-technical.com/etracp.shtml|archivedate=29 April 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[Lloyd Mandeno]], [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]] (1888&amp;ndash;1973) fully developed SWER in [[New Zealand]] around 1925 for rural electrification. Although he termed it "Earth Working Single Wire Line", it was often called "Mandeno’s Clothesline".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/biographies/5m31/1 ''Mandeno, Lloyd'', retrieved 10 August 2011&lt;/ref&gt; More than 200,000 kilometres have now been installed in [[Australia]] and New Zealand. It is considered safe, reliable and low cost, provided that safety features and earthing are correctly installed. The Australian standards are widely used and cited. It has been applied around the world, such as in the [[Provinces and territories of Canada|Canadian province]] of [[Saskatchewan]]; [[Brazil]]; [[Africa]]; and portions of the United States' [[Upper Midwest]] and [[Alaska]] ([[Bethel, Alaska|Bethel]]).

== Description ==
SWER is a viable choice for a distribution system when conventional return current wiring would cost more than SWER’s isolation transformers and small power losses. Power engineers experienced with both SWER and conventional power lines rate SWER as equally safe, more reliable, less costly, but with slightly lower efficiency than conventional lines.&lt;ref name="Mandeno"&gt;Mandeno, L. (1947), [http://www.ruralpower.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=19:swer-and-rural-electrification-downloads&amp;catid=11:swer-and-rural-electrification-downloads&amp;Itemid=9 "Rural Power Supply Especially in Back Country Areas"]. ''Proceedings of the New Zealand Institute of Engineers'', Vol. 33, p. 234.&lt;/ref&gt; SWER can cause fires when maintenance is poor, and bushfire is a risk.&lt;ref name="Victoria"&gt;Victoria, Victorian Bushfires Royal Commission ''Final Report'' (2009), section 4.3.5 [http://royalcommission.vic.gov.au/Commission-Reports/Final-Report/Volume-2/Chapters/Electricity-Caused-Fire.html].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:swer.gif|right|Schematic of SWER]]

Power is supplied to the SWER line by an isolating [[transformer]] of up to 300 [[volt-ampere|kVA]]. This transformer isolates the grid from ground or earth, and changes the grid [[voltage]] (typically 22 or 33 kV line-to-line) to the SWER voltage (typically 12.7 or 19.1 kV line-to-earth).

The SWER line is a single [[conductor (material)|conductor]] that may stretch for tens or even hundreds of kilometres, with a number of distribution transformers along its length.  At each transformer, such as a customer's premises, current flows from the line, through the primary coil of a step-down isolation transformer, to [[Ground (electricity)|earth]] through an earth stake. From the earth stake, the current eventually finds its way back to the main step-up transformer at the head of the line, completing the [[electrical network|circuit]].&lt;ref name="Mandeno" /&gt; SWER is therefore a practical example of a [[phantom loop]].

In areas with high-resistance soil, the resistance of the soil wastes energy. Another issue is that the resistance may be high enough that insufficient current flows into the earth neutral, causing the grounding rod to float to higher voltages. Self-resetting circuit breakers usually reset because of a difference in voltage between line and neutral. Therefore, with dry, high-resistance soils, the reduced difference in voltage between line and neutral may prevent breakers from resetting. In Australia, locations with very dry soils need the grounding rods to be extra deep.&lt;ref&gt;"Service experience with single wire earth return distribution systems in central Queensland". 7th CEPSI conference. Brisbane, Australia, 15–22 October 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;
Experience in Alaska shows that SWER needs to be grounded below [[permafrost]], which is high-resistance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ruralpower.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;catid=9&amp;id=24&amp;Itemid=11# "SWER or SWGR Rural Electrification in Alaska"], SWER FAQs 2. Ruralpower.org, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

The secondary winding of the local transformer will supply the customer with either single ended single phase (N-0) or [[split phase]] (N-0-N) power in the region’s standard appliance voltages, with the 0 volt line connected to a safety earth that does not normally carry an operating current.

A large SWER line may feed as many as 80 distribution transformers. The transformers are usually rated at 5&amp;nbsp;kVA, 10&amp;nbsp;kVA and 25&amp;nbsp;kVA. The load densities are usually below 0.5&amp;nbsp;kVA per kilometer (0.8&amp;nbsp;kVA per mile) of line. Any single customer’s maximum demand will typically be less than 3.5&amp;nbsp;kVA, but larger loads up to the capacity of the distribution transformer can also be supplied. &lt;!-- from distribution world article --&gt;

Some SWER systems in the USA are conventional distribution feeders that were built without a continuous neutral (some of which were obsoleted transmission lines that were refitted for rural distribution service). The substation feeding such lines has a grounding rod on each pole within the substation; then on each branch from the line, the span between the pole next to and the pole carrying the transformer would have a grounded conductor (giving each transformer two grounding points for safety reasons).

== Mechanical design ==
Proper mechanical design of a SWER line can lower its lifetime cost and increase its safety.

Since the line is high voltage, with small currents, the conductor used in historic SWER lines was [[Number_8_wire|Number-8]] galvanized steel fence wire. More modern installations use specially-designed AS1222.1&lt;ref&gt;[http://infostore.saiglobal.com/store2/Details.aspx?ProductID=218259 AS1222.1-1992, Steels and Stays, Bare Overhead, Galvanized] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120330225719/http://infostore.saiglobal.com/store2/Details.aspx?ProductID=218259 |date=30 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://infostore.saiglobal.com/store2/Details.aspx?productID=630145 IEC 60888 Ed. 1.0 Zinc-coated steel wires for stranded conductors] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120330225834/http://infostore.saiglobal.com/store2/Details.aspx?productID=630145 |date=30 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[high-carbon steel]], aluminum-clad wires. Aluminum clad wires corrode in coastal areas, but are otherwise more suitable.&lt;ref name="Mozambique"&gt;[http://www.tdworld.com/overhead-distribution/power-people Power to the People] Describes use of SWER in the rural electrification of Mozambique. Transmission &amp; Distribution World, 2009. Accessed 2011-8-10&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the long spans and high mechanical tensions, vibration from wind can cause damage to the wires. Modern systems install spiral vibration dampers on the wires.&lt;ref name="Mozambique" /&gt;

Insulators are often [[porcelain]] because polymers are prone to [[ultraviolet]] damage. Some utilities install higher-voltage insulators so the line can be easily upgraded to carry more power. For example, 12 kV lines may be insulated to 22 kV, or 19 kV lines to 33 kV.&lt;ref name="Mozambique" /&gt;

[[Reinforced concrete]] poles have been traditionally used in SWER lines because of their low cost, low maintenance, and resistance to water damage, [[termite]]s and [[fungus|fungi]]. Local labor can produce them in most areas, further lowering costs. In New Zealand, metal poles are common (often being former rails from a railway line). Wooden poles are acceptable. In Mozambique, poles had to be at least {{Convert|12|m|ft|abbr=on}} high to permit safe passage of [[giraffe]]s beneath the lines.&lt;ref name="Mozambique" /&gt;

If an area is prone to lightning, modern designs place lightning ground straps in the poles when they are constructed, before erection. The straps and wiring can be arranged to be a low-cost lightning arrestor with rounded edges to avoid attracting a lightning strike.&lt;ref name="Mozambique" /&gt;

== Characteristics ==
=== Safety ===
{{Refimprove section|date=March 2014}}

SWER is promoted as safe due to isolation of the ground from both the generator and user. Most other electrical systems use a metallic neutral connected directly to the generator or a shared ground.&lt;ref name="Mandeno" /&gt;

Grounding is critical. Significant currents on the order of 8&amp;nbsp;[[ampere]]s  flow through the ground near the earth points. A good-quality [[Ground (electricity)|earth connection]] is needed to prevent risk of [[electric shock]] due to [[earth potential rise]] near this point. Separate grounds for power and safety are also used. Duplication of the ground points assures that the system is still safe if either of the grounds is damaged.

A good earth connection is normally a 6&amp;nbsp;m stake of copper-clad steel driven vertically into the ground, and bonded to the transformer earth and tank. A good ground resistance is 5–10 ohms which can be measured using specialist earth test equipment. SWER systems are designed to limit the voltage in the earth to 20 volts per meter to avoid shocking people and animals that might be in the area.

Other standard features include automatic reclosing circuit breakers ([[recloser]]s). Most faults (overcurrent) are transient. Since the network is rural, most of these faults will be cleared by the recloser. Each service site needs a rewirable drop out fuse for protection and switching of the transformer. The transformer secondary should also be protected by a standard high-rupture capacity (HRC) fuse or low voltage circuit breaker. A surge arrestor (spark gap) on the high voltage side is common, especially in lightning-prone areas.

Most fire safety hazards in electrical distribution are from aging equipment: corroded lines, broken insulators, etc. The lower cost of SWER maintenance can reduce the cost of safe operation in these cases.&lt;ref name="Victoria" /&gt;

SWER avoid lines clashing in wind, a substantial fire-safety feature,&lt;ref name="Victoria" /&gt; but a problem surfaced in the [[2009 Victorian Bushfires Royal Commission|official investigation]] into the [[Black Saturday bushfires]] in [[Victoria, Australia]]. These demonstrated that a broken SWER conductor can short to ground across a resistance similar to the circuit's normal load; in that particular case, a tree. This can cause large currents without a ground-fault indication.&lt;ref name="Victoria" /&gt; This can present a danger in fire-prone areas where a conductor may snap and current may arc through trees or dry grass.

Bare-wire or ground-return telecommunications can be compromised by the ground-return current if the grounding area is closer than 100&amp;nbsp;m or sinks more than 10&amp;nbsp;A of current. Modern radio, optic fibre channels, and cell phone systems are unaffected.

Many national electrical regulations (notably the U.S.) require a metallic return line from the load to the generator.&lt;ref name="NEC"&gt;''[[National Electrical Code]]'' (NEC) (2008). Quincy, Mass. (USA): [http://www.nfpa.org/ National Fire Protection Association].&lt;/ref&gt; In these jurisdictions, each SWER line must be approved by exception.

=== Cost advantages ===
SWER’s main advantage is its low cost. It is often used in sparsely populated areas where the cost of building an isolated distribution line cannot be justified. Capital costs are roughly 50% of an equivalent two-wire single-phase line. They can cost 30% of 3-wire three-phase systems. Maintenance costs are roughly 50% of an equivalent line.

SWER also reduces the largest cost of a distribution network: the number of poles. Conventional 2-wire or 3-wire distribution lines have a higher power transfer capacity, but can require 7 poles per kilometre, with spans of 100 to 150 metres. SWER's high line voltage and low current also permits the use of low-cost [[galvanized steel]] wire (historically, No. 8 fence wire).&lt;ref name="Mozambique" /&gt; Steel's greater strength permits spans of 400 metres or more, reducing the number of poles to 2.5 per kilometre.

If the poles also carry [[optical fiber cable]] for [[telecommunication]]s (metal conductors may not be used), capital expenditures by the power company may be further reduced.

=== Reliability ===
SWER can be used in a grid or loop, but is usually arranged in a linear or radial layout to save costs. In the customary linear form, a single-point failure in a SWER line causes all customers further down the line to lose power. However, since it has fewer components in the field, SWER has less to fail. For example, since there is only one line, winds can’t cause lines to clash, removing a source of damage, as well as a source of rural bush fires.

Since the bulk of the transmission line has low resistance attachments to earth, excessive ground currents from shorts and [[geomagnetic storm]]s are more rare than in conventional metallic-return systems. So, SWER has fewer ground-fault circuit-breaker openings to interrupt service.&lt;ref name="Mandeno" /&gt;&lt;!-- Probably because you can't tell a load to ground from a fault to ground... --&gt;

=== Upgradeability ===
A well-designed SWER line can be substantially upgraded as demand grows without new poles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stonepower.se/Lowcostnetworks2.htm Stone Power AB discusses low cost networks]&lt;/ref&gt; The first step may be to replace the steel wire with more expensive copper-clad or aluminum-clad steel wire.

It may be possible to increase the voltage. Some distant SWER lines now operate at voltages as high as 35 kV. Normally this requires changing the insulators and transformers, but no new poles are needed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ruralpower.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;catid=9&amp;id=24&amp;Itemid=11|website=RuralPower.org|title=FAQ2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If more capacity is needed, a second SWER line can be run on the same poles to provide two SWER lines 180&amp;nbsp;degrees out of phase. This requires more insulators and wire, but doubles the power without doubling the poles. Many standard SWER poles have several bolt holes to support this upgrade. This configuration causes most ground currents to cancel, reducing shock hazards and interference with communication lines.

[[Two-phase electric power|Two-phase]] service is also possible with a two-wire upgrade:{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}}{{discuss|Two phase reference}} Though less reliable, it is more efficient. As more power is needed, the lines can be upgraded to match the load, from single wire SWER to two wire, single phase and finally to three wire, three phase. This ensures a more efficient use of capital and makes the initial installation more affordable.

Customer equipment installed before these upgrades will all be single phase, and can be reused after the upgrade. If small amounts of [[three-phase electric power|three-phase power]] are needed, it can be economically synthesized from two-phase power with on-site equipment.

=== Power-quality weakness ===
SWER lines tend to be long, with high impedance, so the voltage drop along the line is often a problem, causing poor regulation. Variations in demand cause variation in the delivered voltage. To combat this, some installations have automatic variable transformers at the customer site to keep the received voltage within legal specifications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Chapman|first=Neil|url=http://tdworld.com/mag/power_one_wire_enough/|title=When One Wire Is Enough|work=Transmission &amp; Distribution World|date=2001-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After some years of experience, the inventor advocated a [[capacitor]] in series with the ground of the main isolation transformer to counteract the inductive reactance of the transformers, wire and earth return path. The plan was to improve the [[power factor]], reduce losses and improve voltage performance due to [[reactive power]] flow.&lt;ref name="Mandeno" /&gt; Though theoretically sound, this is not standard practice. It does also allow the use of a DC test loop, to distinguish a legitimate variable load from (for example) a fallen tree, which would be a DC path to ground.

== Use ==
In addition to New Zealand and Australia, single-wire earth return is used throughout the globe.

=== Alaska ===
In 1981 a high-power 8.5&amp;nbsp;mile prototype SWER line was successfully installed from a [[Diesel generator|diesel plant]] in [[Bethel, Alaska|Bethel]] to [[Napakiak, Alaska|Napakiak]] in [[Alaska]], [[United States]]. It operates at 80&amp;nbsp;kV, and was originally installed on special lightweight [[fiberglass]] poles that formed an [[A-frame]]. Since then, the A frames have been removed and standard wooden [[Utility pole|power poles]] were installed. The A-framed poles could be carried on lightweight [[Snowmobiles|snow machine]]s, and could be installed with hand tools on [[permafrost]] without extensive digging. Erection of "anchoring" poles still required heavy machinery, but the cost savings were dramatic.

Researchers at the [[University of Alaska Fairbanks]], [[United States]] estimate that a network of such lines, combined with coastal [[wind turbine]]s, could substantially reduce rural Alaska’s dependence on increasingly expensive [[diesel fuel]] for power generation.&lt;ref&gt;Bettine, Frank, [http://www.alaska.edu/uaf/cem/ine/aetdl/conferences/2002_sept_docs/singlewiregroundreturn.pdf "Proposal to use single-wire ground return to electrify 40 villages in the Calista region of Alaska"]. 2002 Energy conference, University of Alaska. Modified 2002-10-10, accessed 2008-09-10.&lt;/ref&gt; Alaska’s state economic energy screening survey advocated further study of this option to use more of the state’s underutilized power sources.&lt;ref&gt;http://acep.uaf.edu/media/62360/HVDC-Transmission-System-for-Remote-Alaska.pdf HVDC TRANSMISSION SYSTEM FOR REMOTE ALASKA APPLICATIONS 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In developing nations ===
At present, certain developing nations have adopted SWER systems as their [[mains electricity]] systems, notably [[Laos]], [[South Africa]] and [[Mozambique]].&lt;ref name="Mozambique" /&gt; SWER is also used extensively in Brazil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Arquivos Disponíveis para Download|url=http://www.cepel.br/~per/arquivoutros.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050226101318/http://www.cepel.br/~per/arquivoutros.htm|website=Cepel.br|archivedate=2005-02-26|accessdate=2016-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In HVDC systems ===
Many [[high-voltage direct current]] systems (HVDC) using submarine power cables are single wire earth return systems. Bipolar systems with both positive and negative cables may also retain a seawater grounding electrode, used when one pole has failed. To avoid electrochemical corrosion, the ground electrodes of such systems are situated apart from the converter stations and not near the transmission cable.

The electrodes can be situated in the sea or on land. Bare copper wires can be used for cathodes, and graphite rods buried in the ground, or titanium grids in the sea are used for anodes. To avoid electrochemical corrosion (and [[Passivation (chemistry)|passivation]] of titanium surfaces) the current density at the surface of the electrodes must be small, and therefore large electrodes are required.

Examples of HVDC systems with single wire earth return include the [[Baltic Cable]] and [[Kontek]].

'''Solar architecture''' is an architectural approach that takes in account the Sun to harness clean and renewable [[solar power]]. It is related to the fields of [[optics]], [[thermics]], [[electronics]] and [[materials science]]. Both [[PlusEnergy|active]] and [[Passive house|passive]] solar housing skills are involved in solar architecture.

The use of flexible thin-film [[photovoltaic module]]s provides fluid integration with steel [[Roofing material|roofing]] profiles, enhancing the building's design. Orienting a building to the Sun, selecting materials with favorable [[thermal mass]] or light dispersing properties, and designing spaces that naturally circulate air also constitute solar architecture.

Initial development of solar architecture has been limited by the rigidity and weight of standard solar power panels. The continued development of photovoltaic (PV) thin film solar has provided a lightweight yet robust vehicle to harness [[solar energy]] to reduce a building's impact on the environment. 

==History==
The idea of [[passive solar building design]] first appeared in [[Greece]] around the fifth century BC. Up until that time, the Greeks' main source of fuel had been [[charcoal]], but due to a major shortage of wood to burn they were forced to find a new way of heating their dwellings.&lt;ref name="Solar History"&gt;Perlin, J. [http://www.californiasolarcenter.org/history_passive.html Passive Solar History] (2005, January 1) ''California Solar Center''. Retrieved March 30, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; With necessity as their motivation, the Greeks revolutionized the design of their cities. They began using building materials that absorbed solar energy, mostly stone, and started orienting the buildings so that they faced south. These revolutions, coupled with overhangs that kept out the hot summer sun, created structures which required very little heating and cooling. [[Socrates]] wrote, "In houses that look toward the south, the sun penetrates the portico in winter, while in summer the path of the sun is right over our heads and above the roof so that there is shade."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.greenbuilding.com/knowledge-base/passive-solar-design-history Passive Solar Design – A History] (2010, February 1) ''GreenBuilding.com'' Retrieved March 25, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; 

From this point on, most civilizations have oriented their structures to provide shade in the summer and heating in the winter. The Romans improved on the Greeks' design by covering the southern-facing windows with different types of transparent materials.&lt;ref name="Solar History" /&gt; 

Another simpler example of early solar architecture is the cave dwellings in the southwestern regions of North America. Much like the Greek and Roman buildings, the [[Cliff dwelling|cliffs]] in which the [[Ancestral Puebloans|indigenous people]] of this region built their homes were oriented towards the south with an overhang to shade them from the midday sun during the summer months and capture as much of the solar energy during the winter as possible.&lt;ref&gt;[http://webecoist.momtastic.com/2009/01/25/ancient-green-architecture-alternative-energy-design/ Seven ancient wonders of Greek design and technology] ''Ecoist''. Retrieved April 19, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Active solar architecture involves the moving of heat and/or coolness between a temporary heat storage medium and a building, typically in response to a thermostat's call for heat or coolness within the building. While this principle sounds useful in theory, significant engineering problems have thwarted almost all active solar architecture in practice. The most common form of active solar architecture, rock bed storage with air as a heat transfer medium, usually grew toxic mold in the rock bed which was blown into houses, along with dust and radon in some cases.  

A more complex and modern incarnation of solar architecture was introduced in 1954 with the invention of the [[Solar cell|photovoltaic cell]] by [[Bell Labs]]. Early cells were extremely inefficient and therefore not widely used, but throughout the years government and private research has improved the efficiency to a point where it is now a viable source of energy. 

Universities were some of the first buildings to embrace the idea of solar energy. In 1973, the [[University of Delaware]] built Solar One, which was one of the world's first solar-powered houses. 

As photovoltaic technologies keep advancing, solar architecture becomes easier to accomplish. In 1998 Subhendu Guha developed photovoltaic shingles, and recently{{when|date=September 2018}} a company called Oxford Photovoltaics has developed perovskite solar cells that are thin enough to incorporate into windows.&lt;ref name="Timeline"&gt;[https://www1.eere.energy.gov/solar/pdfs/solar_timeline.pdf The History of Solar] (2012, March 8) U.S. Department of Energy. Retrieved March 26, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the windows are not scaled to a size that can be taken advantage of on a commercial level yet, the company believes that the outlook is promising. In the company’s mission statement they state, "Moreover, through the deployment of solar cells in areas where solar has traditionally struggled, for example the glass façades of high-rise commercial or residential buildings. In both cases, allowing solar energy to contribute a much higher proportion of electricity than is possible today, and helping to position PV as a significant factor in the global energy market."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxfordpv.com/About-us/Our-Vision Our Vision] (2015, January 1) ''Oxford PV''.

== Elements ==

=== Greenhouse ===
[[File:Serre maison canada.png|thumb|Greenhouse in Canada]]

A [[greenhouse]] keeps heat from the Sun. In a double glazed greenhouse, three effects occur: no convection (air blocking), ray keeping (the ground absorbs a photon, emits it with lower infrared energy, and the glass reflects this infrared to the ground), and little conduction (double glazing). It seems that the convection effect is the most important, as greenhouses in poor countries are made of plastic.

The greenhouse can be used to grow plants in the winter, to grow tropical plants, as a terrarium for reptiles or insects, or simply for air comfort. It must be ventilated, but not too much, otherwise the convection will make the inside colder, losing the desired effect. The greenhouse may be combined with heat storage or an opaque mask.

=== Photothermic module ===
[[File:Photothermic roof.png|thumb|Photothermic modules on roof]]

[[Solar_thermal_collector#Flat_plate_collectors|Photothermic]] modules convert solar light into heat. They easily heat domestic water to 80 °C (353 K). They are put facing the sunny cardinal point, rather pointing towards the horizon to avoid overheating in summer, and take more calories in the winter. In a 45° North place, the module should face the south and the angle to the horizontal should be about 70°.

The use of intermediate solar heat systems like evacuated tubes, compound parabolic, and parabolic trough, is discussed as they correspond to specific, intermediate needs. A customer who wants a cheap system will prefer the photothermic, giving 80 °C (353 K) hot water with 70-85 % efficiency. A customer who wants high temperatures will prefer the solar parabola, giving 200 °C (573 K) with 70-85 % efficiency.

[[Do it yourself]] photothermic modules are cheaper and can use a spiral pipe, with hot water coming from the center of the module. Other geometries exist, like serpentine or quadrangular.

If on a flat roof, a mirror can be placed in front of the photothermic module to give it more sunlight.

The photothermic module has become popular in Mediterranean countries, with Greece and Spain counting with 30-40 % of homes equipped with this system, and becoming part of the landscape.

=== Photovoltaic module ===
[[File:Triple junction amorphous photovoltaic tiles.png|thumb|Photovoltaic tiles on roof]]

[[Photovoltaic]] modules convert solar light into electricity. Classical silicon solar modules have up to 25 % efficiency but they are rigid and cannot easily be placed on curves. Thin film solar modules are flexible, but they have lower efficiency and lifetime.

Photovoltaic tiles combine the useful to the pleasant by providing tile-like photovoltaic surfaces.

A pragmatic rule is to put the photovoltaic surface facing the sunny cardinal point, with a latitude-equal angle to the horizontal. For example, if the house is 33° South, the photovoltaic surface should face the north with 33° to the horizontal. From this rule comes a general standard of roof angle, that is the norm in solar architecture.

=== Thermal storage ===
The simplest solar heat water system is to place a [[hot water storage tank]] towards the Sun and paint it black.

A thick ground of rock in a greenhouse will keep some heat through the night. The rock will absorb heat in the day and emit it in the night. Water has the best [[thermal capacity]] for a common material and remains a sure value.

=== Electrical storage ===

In autonomous (off-grid) photovoltaic systems, batteries are used to store the excess of electricity, and deliver it when needed in the night.

Grid-connected systems can use interseasonal storage thanks to [[pumped-storage hydroelectricity]]. An innovative storage method, [[compressed air energy storage]], is also being studied, and may be applied at the scale of a region or a home, whether a cave or a tank is used to store the compressed air.

=== White wall ===
[[File:Perissa eglise.jpg|thumb|White walled church in Santorini]]

In the Greek islands, the houses are painted in white to keep from absorbing heat. The white walls covered with lime and the blue roofs make the Greek islands' traditional style appreciated by tourists for its colors, and by the inhabitants for the cooler interior air.

=== Black wall ===
[[File:Toit vegetal norvege.png|thumb|Black walled house in Norway]]

In Nordic countries, this is the opposite: the houses are painted in black to better absorb the irradiation heat. [[Basalt]] is an interesting material as it is naturally black and exhibits high thermal storage capacity.

=== Solar tracker ===
Part or all of the house can track the Sun's race in the sky to catch its light. The [[Heliotrope (building)|Heliotrope]], the first positive energy house in the world, rotates to catch the sunlight, converted into electricity by photovoltaic modules, heating the house through the translucent glass.

Tracking requires electronics and automatics. There are two ways to let the system know where the Sun is: instrumental and theoretical. The instrumental method uses captors of light to detect the Sun's position. The theoretical method uses astronomical formulas to know the Sun's place. One or two axis motors will make the solar system rotate to face the Sun and catch more of its Sunlight.

A photovoltaic or photothermic module can gain more than 50% of production, thanks to a tracker system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Labouret and Villoz|title=Installations solaires photovoltaïques|date=2012|pages=183|edition=Dunod}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Solar mask ===
[[File:Heliodome principe.png|thumb|The Heliodome has shadow in the summer, and sunlight in the winter.]]

Sometimes the heat becomes too high, so a shadow may be desired. The Heliodome has been built in such a way that the roof hides the Sun in the summer to avoid overheating, and lets the sunlight pass in the winter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Héliodome Youtube|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggUtC12R4Ok}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a mask, any opaque material is fine. A curtain, a cliff, or a wall can be solar masks. If a leafy tree is put in front of a greenhouse, it may hide the greenhouse in the summer, and let the sunlight enter in the winter, when the leaves have fallen. The shadows will not work the same according to the season. Using the seasonal change to get shadow in the summer, light in the winter, is a general rule for a solar mask.

=== Solar chimney ===

A [[solar chimney]] is a chimney of outside black color. They were used in Roman antiquity as a ventilation system. The black surface makes the chimney heat with sunlight. The air inside gets warmer and moves up, pumping the air from the underground, that is at 15 °C (288 K) all the year. This traditional air-ground exchanger was used to make the houses cool in the summer, mild in the winter.

The solar chimney may be coupled with a [[badgir]] or a wood chimney for stronger effect.

=== Solar parabola ===
[[File:Solar kitchen auroville.png|thumb|The Auroville's solar parabola]]

A solar parabola is a parabolic mirror that concentrates the sunlight to reach high temperatures. In [[Auroville]]'s collective kitchen, a large solar parabola on the roof provides heat for cooking.

The solar parabola can also be used for industrial building. The [[Odeillo solar furnace]], one of the largest solar parabola in the world, concentrates the sunlight 10,000 times and reaches temperatures above 3,200 K. No material resists, even [[diamond]] melts. It opens the vision of a futuristic metallurgy, using a clean and renewable source of energy.

==Examples==
One of the first large commercial buildings to exemplify solar architecture is 4 Times Square (also known as the [[Condé Nast Building]]) in [[New York City]]. It has built-in solar panels on the 37th through the 43rd floors, and incorporated more energy-efficient technology than any other skyscraper at the time of its construction.&lt;ref name="Timeline"/&gt; The [[National Stadium (Kaohsiung)|National Stadium]] in [[Kaohsiung, Taiwan]], designed by the Japanese architect [[Toyo Ito]], is a dragon-shaped structure that has 8,844 solar panels on its roof.{{cn|date=April 2015}} It was built in 2009 to house the 2009 world games. Constructed completely of recycled materials, it is the largest solar-powered stadium in the world and powers the surrounding neighborhood when it is not in use. The Sundial Building in China was built to symbolize the need for replacing [[fossil fuel]]s with [[renewable energy]] sources. The building is shaped like a fan and is covered in {{convert|50,000|sqft|m2|order=flip}} of solar panels. It was named the world's largest solar-powered office building in 2009.

Although it is not yet completed, the Solar City Tower in [[Rio de Janeiro]] is another example of what solar architecture might look like in the future. It is a power plant that generates energy for the city during the day while also pumping water to the top of the structure. At night, when the sun is not shining, the water will be released to run over [[turbine]]s that will continue to generate electricity. It was set to be revealed at the [[2016 Olympic Games]] in Rio, although the project is still in the proposal phase.&lt;ref&gt;Satre-Meloy, Aven [https://joinmosaic.com/blog/solar-architecture/ Five Jaw Dropping Solar Architecture Projects]. (2014, February 25) ''Mosaic Blog''. Retrieved March 27, 2015.{{unreliable source|date=April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Environmental benefits ==

Using solar power in architecture contributes to a world of clean and renewable energy. This is an investment: the initial price is high, but afterwards, there is nearly nothing to pay. On the contrary, fossil and fissile energies are cheap in the beginning, but cost tremendous amounts to humans and nature. The Fukushima catastrophe is evaluated to cost 210 billion dollars to Japan,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Tokyo, Kyoto et environs|date=2016|publisher=Le Routard|page=98}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Global warming has already been a cause of species extinction.

Solar architecture is then anti-crisis. If all houses were to be rebuilt to meet solar architecture standards, this would bring hope, jobs, money, and economical growth.

==Criticism== 
According to an article on ECN's website titled "Architects just want to develop attractive buildings", an architect's main purpose is to "create a spatial object with lines, shapes, colours and texture. These are the challenges for the architect within the customer's programme of requirements. But they do not immediately think of using a solar panel as an interesting building material. There is still much to be achieved here."&lt;ref&gt;Kaan, H. (2009, June 12). [https://www.ecn.nl/nl/nieuws/newsletter-en/2009/june-2009/solar-energy-architecture/ Architects just want to develop attractive buildings] ''ECN''. Retrieved April 19, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; In the article it is stated multiple times that solar panels are not an architect's first choice for building material because of their cost and aesthetics.
 
Another criticism of installing solar panels is their upfront cost. According to energyinfomative.org, the average cost for a residential solar system is between $15,000 and $40,000 (USD), and about $7 per watt.&lt;ref&gt;Maehlum, M. (2015, March 23). [http://energyinformative.org/solar-panels-cost/ How Much Do Solar Panels Cost] ''Energy Informative''. Retrieved April 19, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; In the article, it says that at today's rates, it would take 10 years to pay off an average system. As a solar panel may last more than 20 years,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Labouret and Villoz|title=Installations photovoltaïques|date=2012|page=13|edition=Dunod}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the end, it becomes a benefit.

The '''state-transition equation''' is defined as the solution of the linear homogeneous state equation. The linear time-invariant state equation given by
:&lt;math&gt;\frac {dx(t)}{dt}=Ax(t)+Bu(t)+Ew(t), &lt;/math&gt;
with state vector ''x'', control vector ''u'', vector ''w'' of additive disturbances, and fixed matrices ''A'', ''B'', and ''E'', can be solved by using either the classical method of solving linear [[differential equations]] or the [[Laplace transform]] method. The Laplace transform solution is presented in the following equations.
The Laplace transform of the above equation yields 
:&lt;math&gt;sX(s)-x(0)=AX(s)+BU(s)+EW(s) &lt;/math&gt;
where x(0) denotes '''initial-state vector''' evaluated at &lt;math&gt;t=0&lt;/math&gt; . Solving for &lt;math&gt;X(s)&lt;/math&gt; gives
:&lt;math&gt;X(s)=(sI-A)^{-1} x(0) + (sI-A)^{-1}[BU(s)+EW(s)]. &lt;/math&gt;
So, the state-transition equation can be obtained by taking inverse Laplace transform as 
:&lt;math&gt;x(t)=L^{-1}[(sI-A)^{-1}] x(0) + L^{-1} {(sI-A)^{-1} [BU(s) + EW(s)]}= \phi(t)x(0)+\int_{0}^{t} \phi(t-\tau)[Bu(\tau)+Ew(\tau)]dt .&lt;/math&gt;

The state-transition equation as derived above is useful only when the initial time is defined to be at &lt;math&gt;t=0&lt;/math&gt; . In the study of [[control system]]s, specially discrete-data control systems, it is often desirable to break up a state-transition process into a sequence of transitions, so a more flexible initial time must be chosen. Let the initial time be represented by &lt;math&gt;t_0&lt;/math&gt; and the corresponding initial state by &lt;math&gt;x(t_0)&lt;/math&gt;, and assume that the input &lt;math&gt; u(t)&lt;/math&gt; and the disturbance &lt;math&gt; w(t)&lt;/math&gt; are applied at t≥0. 
Starting with the above equation by setting &lt;math&gt; t=t_0,&lt;/math&gt; and solving for &lt;math&gt;x(0)&lt;/math&gt;, we get 
:&lt;math&gt; x(0)= \phi (-t_0)x(t_0)-\phi(-t_0)\int_{0}^{t_0}\phi(t_0 - \tau)[Bu(\tau)+Ew(\tau)]d\tau.&lt;/math&gt;
Once the state-transition equation is determined, the output vector can be expressed as a function of the initial state.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15996">A '''test engineer''' is a professional who determines how to create a process that would best test a particular product in [[manufacturing]] and related disciplines in order to assure that the product meets applicable [[specification]]s. Test engineers are also responsible for determining the best way a test can be performed in order to achieve adequate [[test coverage]]. Often test engineers also serve as a liaison between [[manufacturing]], [[design engineering]], [[sales engineering]] and [[marketing]] communities as well. 

Test engineers can have different expertise which depends on what test process they are more familiar with (although many test engineers have full familiarity from the [[Printed circuit board|PCB]] level processes like [[in-circuit test|ICT]], [[JTAG]], and [[AXI]]) to [[printed circuit board assembly|PCBA]] and system level processes like board functional test ('''BFT''' or [[Functional Testing (manufacturing)|FT]]), [[burn-in|burn-in test]], '''system level test''' ([[system test|ST]]). Some of the processes used in manufacturing&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tcdmsecurity.com/english/3_capabilities/02_detail.php?MID=64&amp;ID=23 ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080925155518/http://www.tcdmsecurity.com/english/3_capabilities/02_detail.php?MID=64&amp;ID=23 |date=September 25, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; where a test engineer is needed are:

==Early project involvement from design phase==

Ideally, a test engineer's involvement with a product begins with the very early stages of the design phase. Depending on the culture of the firm, the early stages could refer to [[Product Requirements Document|Product Requirements Document (PRD)]] and [[Marketing Requirements Document|Marketing Requirements Document (MRD)]]—some of the earliest work done during a [[new product introduction|new product introduction (NPI)]]. 

By working with or as part of the [[new product introduction|NPI]] group, a test engineer ensures that a product is designed for both testability and manufacturability. In other words, to make sure that the product can be readily tested and built.

The following are some general rules to ensure testability and manufacturability of a product:

* Making sure the product has correct label specs and placement that would make it possible for the unit to be traceable and programmable.  Implementing good label specs results in having correct information programmed correctly into the [[device under test|unit under test (UUT)]] (sometimes called '''DUT''' or '''device under test''').  To make this possible, the test engineers enforce those labels location and are all readable and scannable, thus eliminating the need for a manual typing of information into the unit. Automatic placing of identification codes into the part during test and making them available for verification at later processing steps can help minimize these types of errors. Manual typing can introduce problems related to inaccurate information being programmed due to human errors.  Also, without the test engineers input during PRD design phase, the hardware engineer in charge of designing of the silk-screen for the PCB may put those labels below some attachable board which will then later renders the labels useless (i.e. in a motherboard/daughterboard design and also a board that has a pluggable module, a label would be visible on the main board by itself but would be obstructed by the other boards that needs to be integrated).  This information are often indicated in both PRD and MRD.
* Making sure that all components required to test and debug the UUT, which includes the console/serial port, are all accessible from the early part of the manufacturing process up to the last part which is often the '''final quality audit/assurance''' ('''FQA''') process.  This also includes making sure those components are available even after the units are returned by the customers for troubleshooting or repair.  By following this guidelines, the team will eliminate unnecessary opening of the UUT just to access those components which may result in introducing errors into the unit (i.e. knocking off some capacitors or resistors when opening/sliding out the cover, dropping the tool inside the PCBA after opening, forgetting some other cables to reconnect before closing the unit for manufacturing process flow continuation, etc.).
* Making sure that all components needed to test the unit are added into the cost matrix of the final product.  This components may include the UART/RS232 chips for talking to the UUT, ethernet ports for upgrading the firmware, [[JTAG connector]]s, etc.
* Defining what manufacturing test process is needed based from the product definition.
* Verifying that the currently available test equipment is adequate for testing the proposed design. If new equipment is needed, budgetary concerns have been addressed and sufficient lead time exists for new equipment installation and verification. Also, new test equipment may require training for test equipment operators and supervisors.

By following the general rules above, test engineers minimize future surprises (like adding extra components, re-layout of the boards, etc.) which drives up costs and development delays of the final product.

==Working with cross platform teams, hardware and software team==
Often people take shortcuts to be able to deliver final products.  Because of these shortcuts, the product's manufacturability and testability becomes complicated (inability to read and write information, creating deviation from the process, etc.) which impacts the manufacturing complexity of a product.  Because of this complexity, bottlenecks in the manufacturing and delivery schedule delays are introduced.

With this in mind, test engineers always get involved in the following reviews as well:
* Schematics review - to make sure all components and data/electrical paths are accessible and testable
* Board layout review  - to make sure all labels and components are accessible.  No components are near the edges, covers, movable parts, etc. that would result into higher probability of a components being knocked off the board.
* Electrical specifications review - to make sure all we can drive the needed power into the board with any fixture needed in any of the process (ICT fixture needs to make sure it can supply the appropriate power to the board without external power supplies, the Burn-In and ESS chamber can provide the required voltage and current to a number of fixtures and at the same time without modifying the chambers specs so it can mix with other products)
* Diagnostics specifications review - to make sure command output formats are followed for simplification of whatever [[test automation]] tools will be developed.  Also, to make sure that the commands themselves are available to test all components.

==Yield maintenance==
Products' yield plays a very important part during their lifespan.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mentor.com/products/silicon-yield/techpubs/beyond-pass-fail-testing-using-failure-data-from-manufacturing-test-for-yield-27752&lt;/ref&gt; There are usually three stages for a product, '''engineering''', '''initial production''' (IP) and '''full production''' (FP). 
* In early stages, engineering, production yield fluctuates a lot. The manufacturing process is under debugging and optimising. Foundry engineers usually work with factories to drive the yield of the product. Most companies set specific yield targets for each process to hit the expected yields. 
* Once the product yield is stable, usually 80%, the test engineer is responsible for advancing the product from engineering stages to initial production stages. During this period, the test engineer will monitor the production yield for a period of time, change the test program limits and even work with foundry engineer to further improve the yield. 
* Once the production yield is above 90%, the test engineer can turn on full production for this product, and will continue to monitor and improve production yield. 
In addition, yields will show if another process needs to be introduced (e.g., because processes already used cannot capture certain test errors).  Yields can also decide if an existing test process can be trimmed down (step-wise or time-wise) or even fully eliminated. E.g., if the ESS errors can be captured during the 3rd hour, test time can be cut down from a normal 24 hours down to maybe 4.  Or if a process consistently yields 100% during a 15-month period, teams can get together and decide to eliminate that process at all.

==Test automation==

Test automation refers to the automation of the process to test a product through the use of machines. Depending on the product, the machines that we are referring to could mean a combination of [[Automatic Test Equipment|Automatic Test Equipment (ATE)]], handler, interface board, and test program that drives the ATE, as with the case of the [[Integrated Circuit|IC]] chip testing.

Test automation is a big part of a test engineer's job. 

The whole intention of automating the test is as follows:
* Enforce test steps to be followed within specifications and correct timing.
* Eliminate manual command and data inputs.

==Defining standard test documents==
Following are some of the documents that the test engineers maintain or define:

* [[Test method]]
* [[Diagnostic design specification]]
* [[Manufacturing test requirement design specification]]
* [[Design for test|Design for testability (DFT)]]
* [[Design for manufacturability (PCB)|Design for manufacturability (DFM)]]
* [[Test plan#Test plans in hardware development|Test plan]]

==Contract manufacturer==
A '''contract manufacturer''' ('''CM''') also provides a test engineer for their customers.  The function of these test engineers varies depending on the level of support they provide for their customers: providing "interactive and first level of defense"-only support or providing partial or ground-up solutions.

===Providing interactive and first level-of-defense support===
Providing "interactive and first level-of-defense"-only support is the usual job of the CM TE.  Here are some typical job functions for a CM test engineer:
* Reviewing test solutions with their partnering test engineers from the customer side.
* Analyzing if the infrastructure meets the requirements (from floor/line setup, network access to workstations and/or servers, operator manpower, etc.).
* Getting familiar with the customer products' technology.
* Being able to manage, train and support operators who performs the actual testing.
* Being able to debug and isolate problems.
* Gathering information to feed back to their partners.

Because of their close involvement with the test line, they monitor the products going through the line and inspect the failed boards to decide if it really failed or if the failure was just caused by some improper test setup.  Some examples of these false failures are:
* Forgot to connect the cable to talk to the UUT (or misplacing the cable or putting it loose).  This will cause the test automation to time out for any response from the UUT.
* Forgot to connect the loopback cables when testing a UUT with any networking interface (ethernet/optical/etc ports).  This will cause the traffic test to fail.
* Skipped some test process.  Some test process will configure the UUT to load some firmware or put it in some state (i.e. preparing it to run in burn-in mode) so when the test automation starts, whatever known state it is expecting will not be satisfied and thus fail.
* Skipped to implement some deviations that would require hardware/software changes to the UUT.
* Forgot to power up the unit right away when the test automation started.  This will result to the same problem as the first item of this list.
* Forgot to attach any other test fixture components.

===Providing partial or ground up solutions===
There is a small number of companies who prefer to outsource their test engineering work to their corresponding CM. In that case, the CM TEs will be in charge of providing the test automation solution, test fixture design, yield gathering plus the usual interactive and first level of defense for their customers.

Of course, outsourcing test solutions to the CM has its pros and cons.  

Some of the advantages are:
* Cheaper cost. Especially if the CM resides in a country where labor is at minimum.
* Beneficial if the company itself doesn't have or cannot find any TE that matches the company's requirements.

Some of the disadvantages are:
* Getting tied up to a single CM.  It is hard to find a CM that is willing to share information to another CM.
* CM TEs are seldom involved with product design stage/phase.
* Time constraints.  They only get handed out the specs of the product during late NPI stage.  Because of this, test solutions are rushed and quality are often compromised.
* Conflict of interest.  Company needs to know every level of information that goes through the product line in order to monitor potential problems that would one day snowball.  But CM doesn't provide this level of details, they only give out how many units passed or fail for the day.  A unit could have failed 5 times before it passes which may relates to some timing issues of some components of the product like the CPU or oscillators for example.  The cleaner the first passed yield data that the CM provides, the better quality the unit went through the assembly line.  This means that the CM would be enticed to provide the final result as their first passed yield data instead so it will reflect their higher quality side.

Because it is hard to find a test engineer who knows every aspect of testing methodology (from PCB tests like ICT, JTAG test, flying probe test, and X-Ray test to PCBA test which includes writing test automation from functional test to FQA test among others), companies usually outsource part of the development of this missing test piece to their CM.  For example, if none of the in-house TEs know much about ICT fixtures, they will ask their CM to develop the ICT test solutions for them instead.

'''ToneTag''' is a [[Fintech]] and Retail Solutions company, which uses encrypted sound waves to make offline, proximity-based contactless payments on any device. The company uses [[Software development kit|proprietary Software Development Kit]] (SDK) that encodes data into sounds. These sounds are transmitted over air and can enable payments over the existing payments infrastructure.

==History==

The idea for ToneTag germinated when the founder and current CEO of the company, Kumar Abhishek was asked the following question by a Singaporean friend, “Why is it in [[India]] we get candies instead of balance cash?” Kumar saw an opportunity, and along with his friend and co-founder Vivek Singh started a research project on “How to enable small payments through the mobile”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/payments-by-sound-making-waves-in-fintech-space/articleshow/61745256.cms|title=Payments by sound making waves in fintech space|last=|first=|date=|work=|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The research was followed by experimentation with various alternate [[Mobile Payment|payment technologies]] to find a solution to this common problem. In September 2017, Infosys partnered with ToneTag to enable contactless payments solutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/ites/infosys-partners-with-tonetag-for-sound-based-payments/articleshow/60794594.cms|title=Infosys partners with ToneTag for sound based payments|date=2017-09-22|work=The Economic Times|access-date=2018-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.business-standard.com/article/companies/infosys-partners-with-tonetag-to-enable-contactless-payments-solutions-117092200467_1.html|title=Infosys partners with ToneTag to enable contactless payments solutions|last=Market|first=Capital|date=2017-09-22|work=Business Standard India|access-date=2018-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''torque limiter''' is an automatic device that protects mechanical equipment, or its work, from damage by mechanical overload. A torque limiter may limit the [[torque]] by slipping (as in a friction plate slip-[[clutch]]), or uncouple the load entirely (as in a [[shear pin]]). The action of a torque limiter is especially useful to limit any damage due to crash stops and jams.

Torque limiters may be packaged as a shaft [[coupling]] or as a hub for [[sprocket]] or [[sheave]]. A torque limiting device is also known as an '''overload clutch'''.

==Disconnect types==
Disconnect types will uncouple the drive, with little or no residual torque making its way to the load. They may reset automatically or manually

===Shear pin===
{{main|Shear pin}}
A shear pin type sacrifices a mechanical component, the pin, to disconnect the shafts.

===Synchronous magnetic===
A synchronous magnetic torque limiter uses permanent magnets mounted to each shaft, with an air gap between. They are very fast acting, but may have more backlash than mechanical types. Because there is no mechanical contact between the two shafts, they are also used to transmit torque through a physical barrier like a thin plastic wall. On some models, the torque limit may be adjusted by changing the gap between the magnets.

===Ball detent===
A ball detent type limiter transmits force through hardened balls which rest in detents on the shaft and are held in place with springs. An  over-torque condition pushes the balls out of their detents, thereby decoupling the shaft. It can have single or multiple detent positions, or a snap acting spring which requires a manual reset. There may be a compression adjustment to adjust the torque limit.

Many cordless drills incorporate this type of torque limiter in a [[planetary gearset]]. It may be a part of an assembly of multiple gearsets used to primarily reduce speed and multiply torque as well as perform ratio changes. The torque limiter is typically the last gearset in the [[Transmission (mechanics)|transmission]]. It uses the planet carrier as the input with the sun gear as the output, and the annulus normally locked. A series of ball detents act on the annulus to lock it, allowing power to be transmitted from the planet carrier to the sun gear. When the torque transmitted through the gearset reaches a determinate amount, the torque acting on the annulus causes it to unlock from its ball detents and freely rotate, causing power to be diverted from the load on the sun gear to the annulus and thereby stalling the output until torque is reduced to an amount where the ball detents can lock the annulus again. This system equally limits torque in both directions of rotation and also works with the sun gear as the input. The compression of the ball detents (and therefore the amount of torque at which the limiter is utilized) is typically adjusted by means of a rotating collar accessible to the user which is indexed and held in place with its own separate ball detents.

===Pawl and spring===
This mechanical type uses a spring to hold a drive pawl against a notch in the rotor. It may feature automatic or manual reset. A compression adjustment on the spring determines the torque limit.

==Torque limiting types==
Torque limiting types will limit the torque by slipping (i.e. letting the drive shaft run faster than the driven shaft.) Excess power is dissipated as heat. They don't need to be reset.

===Friction plate===
This type is similar to a friction plate clutch. Over-torque will cause the plates to slip.  A simple example is found in a fixed-spool [[fishing reel]], where the slipping torque is set by means of a large hand nut in order that the reel will turn and allow more line to unwind before the line breaks under the pull of a fish.

===Magnetic particle===
A magnetic particle clutch can be used effectively as a torque limiter. The torque setting fairly approximates a linear relationship with the current passing through the windings, which can be statically or dynamically set depending on needs.

===Magnetic hysteresis===
This type is non-synchronous in normal operation, so there is always some slippage.

'''USNS ''Kingsport'' (T-AG-164)''' was built as '''SS ''Kingsport Victory''''', a [[United States Maritime Commission]] VC2-S-AP3 ([[Victory ship|Victory]]) type cargo ship. During the closing days of [[World War II]] the ship was operated by the [[American Hawaiian Steamship Company]] under an agreement with the [[War Shipping Administration]]. After a period of layup the ship was operated as '''USAT ''Kingsport Victory''''' by the Army under bareboat charter effective 8 July 1948. When Army transports were transferred to the Navy's [[Military Sea Transportation Service]] the ship continued as '''USNS ''Kingsport Victory'' (T-AK-239)''', a cargo transport . On 14 November 1961, after conversion into the first satellite communication ship, the ship was renamed ''Kingsport'', reclassified as a general auxiliary, and operated as '''USNS ''Kingsport'' (T-AG-164)'''.

==Construction==
''Kingsport Victory'', a United States Maritime Commission VC2-S-AP3 (Victory) type cargo ship, was laid down 4 April 1944 with launch on 29 May and completion on 12 July 1944 with delivery to the [[War Shipping Administration]] (WSA) on the same day at Los Angeles. She was built under the [[Emergency Shipbuilding program]] under cognizance of the [[U.S. Maritime Commission]]. {{sfn|MARAD Vessel Status Card: ''Kingsport Victory''}}{{sfn|Colton: California Shipbuilding, Los Angeles CA}} Basic dimensions, not counting modifications for satellite communications, were length {{convert|436|ft|6|in|m|1}} (LBP), {{convert|62|ft|m|1}} beam and {{GRT|7653}}.{{sfn|MARAD Vessel Status Card: ''Kingsport'' (AG-164)}}

== World War II &amp; Army service==
''Kingsport Victory'' was immediately placed under operation by the American Hawaiian Steamship Company under [[War Shipping Administration]] general agency agreement. ''Kingsport Victory'' serviced a cargo ship to supply troop in the [[Pacific War]].  ''Kingsport Victory'' made trips between the California to [[Pearl Harbor]]. She streamed from California on 17 October 1944 arriving at [[Milne Bay]], [[New Guinea]] on 2 November. She moved cargo for the war to US troops and ships at [[Eniwetok]], [[Iwo Jima]], [[Guam]], [[Ulithi]] atoll and [[Okinawa]]. After the war on December 1945 streamed from Okinawa to [[Hong Kong]], then [[Calcutta]]. Through the [[Suez Canal]] she arrived at [[New York City]] on 27 February 1946. During 1946 she moved cargo from the US East and West Coasts. ''Kingsport Victory'' was active in delivering support for the [[Battle of Iwo Jima]] from 19 February to 26 March 1945. In each battle she had to use her [[deck gun]]s to defend against air attacks. ''Kingsport Victory'' received one [[Battle stars]] for her World War II service.&lt;ref&gt;[http://marinesinforestgreen.blogspot.com/2012/10/list-of-ships-at-battle-of-iwo-jima.html Marines, List of Ships At The Battle of Iwo Jima]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.history.navy.mil/research/library/online-reading-room/title-list-alphabetically/a/amphibious-operations-capture-iwo-jima.html US Navy History, Amphibious Operations Capture of Iwo Jima]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.history.navy.mil/research/histories/ship-histories/danfs/k/kingsport-victory.html Navy History ''Kingsport Victory'']&lt;/ref&gt;

After the war, on 29 September 1947, she was taken out of service and placed in the reserve fleet at [[Lee Hall, Virginia]].{{sfn|MARAD Vessel Status Card: ''Kingsport Victory''}} On 8 April 1948 the ship was taken out of reserve and [[bareboat charter]]ed to the [[United States Department of War|War Department]] for operation as the [[United States Army Transport|USAT]] ''''Kingsport Victory'' a [[US Army]] Transport. During this time the ship was involved in a legal case, ''Johansen, v. United States'', involving rights of an Army civil service employee crew member in personal injury cases.{{sfn|United States Court of Appeals Second Circuit}} On 1 March 1950 she was removed from US Army Transport and transferred the US Navy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.navalcovermuseum.org/restored/KINGSPORT_T-AG_164.html navalcovermuseum, ''Kingsport Victory'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Navy MSTS service==
''Kingsport Victory'' was among large Army ships transferred to the Navy's [[Military Sea Transportation Service]] (MSTS) with ''Kingsport Victory'' being transferred effective 1 March 1950.{{sfn|MARAD Vessel Status Card: ''Kingsport Victory''}} The ship carried military cargo for the next eleven years as USNS ''Kingsport Victory'' (T-AK-239). ''Kingsport Victory'' is seen in an Air Force documentary film on the construction of the [[Dew Line]] loading supplies at [[Norfolk, Virginia]] and unloading at [[Halifax, Nova Scotia]].{{sfn|National Archives: Dew Line: Documentary synopsis}}

Assigned to duty supporting the U.S. Army Satellite Communications Agency USNS ''Kingsport'' was further modified and, in August 1963 while in [[Lagos]] harbor, transmitted the first satellite voice call between heads of state when [[John F. Kennedy]] and Nigerian Prime Minister [[Abubakar Balewa]] aboard ''Kingsport'' spoke in a two-way call. A demonstration of transmission of oceanographic data was made between a research vessel off Africa via the ship and satellite to Washington. The first air to ship satellite communication took place when Navy aircraft off Virginia established voice communication with ''Kingsport'' which was off [[Morocco]]. Further satellite communications work took place in the Pacific and Indian Oceans. ''Kingsport'' then supported [[Project Gemini]] into March 1966. After conversion from satellite configuration, particularly removal of the large and very visible dome, ''Kingsport'' was engaged in acoustic work for the Navy supporting undersea surveillance programs.

===Satellite communications ship ''Kingsport''===
On 24 September 1961, she was delivered to the [[Portland, Oregon]] facilities of [[Willamette Iron &amp; Steel Company]] where she underwent conversion to become the first satellite communications ship.{{sfn|Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships: ''Kingsport Victory''}}{{sfn|U.S. Fleet Forces Command: August 23}}  On 14 November 1961 she was renamed ''Kingsport'' and reclassified AG-164.{{sfn|Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships: ''Kingsport Victory''}}

Designed for use by the [[United States Army]] Satellite Communications Agency in the defense satellite communications programs, Project ADVENT, USNS ''Kingsport'' underwent extensive alteration during conversion. A special [[high frequency]] radio station was installed for ship-to-shore communications. She received advanced tracking and telemetry equipment and anti-roll stabilization tanks. In addition, a 30-foot, gyro-stabilized, computer-oriented, triaxial, [[parabolic antenna]] was installed on her afterdeck. Housed in a 53-foot, plastic, air-pressurized [[radome]], this antenna permitted precision tracking of a high altitude satellite at any angle above the horizon.{{sfn|Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships: ''Kingsport Victory''}}

''Kingsport'' sailed to [[Lagos]], Nigeria after [[Syncom 2]] had been successfully launched on 26 July 1963 to serve as the terminal control station during testing and evaluation of the satellite.{{sfn|Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships: ''Kingsport Victory''}} On 23 August 1963, President [[John F. Kennedy]] in Washington, D.C., telephoned Nigerian Prime Minister [[Abubakar Balewa]] aboard the ''Kingsport'' docked in Lagos Harbor via [[Syncom 2]], the first geosynchronous communication satellite. It was the first live two-way call between heads of state by satellite.{{sfn|U.S. Fleet Forces Command: August 23}}{{sfn|Uhlig, Sellmaier &amp; Schmidhuber}} [[Syncom|Syncom 2]] and [[Communications satellite|Relay 1]] linked Nigeria, Brazil and the United States with ''Kingsport'' transmitting through Syncom 2 to New Jersey and New Jersey via Relay 1 to Rio de Janeiro.{{sfn|Williamson|p=185}} During this period [[Gulf of Guinea]] oceanographic data, composed of depths temperature and salinity from a {{convert|1000|m|ft}} station, were transmitted from the {{RV|Geronimo}} to the [[National Oceanographic Data Center]] via ''Kingsport'' and Syncom 2.{{sfn|ICO Report #6lP-64}}

''Kingsport'' departed Lagos 23 September and during transit off Morocco on 2 October demonstrated the first satellite communications between an aircraft in flight when a Navy aircraft off the Virginia coast made voice contact with the ship via satellite.{{sfn|Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships: ''Kingsport Victory''}}{{sfn|Applied Research Laboratory|p=49}} The ship reached [[Rota, Spain]] on 3 October, staying until 6 October, then sailed supporting communication tests in the Mediterranean from 7 to 25 October.{{sfn|Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships: ''Kingsport Victory''}} Tests of voice and teletype links between the United States and ships of the 6th Fleet successful with the ship visiting [[Leghorn, Italy]] and [[Beirut]], Lebanon during the voyage.{{sfn|Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships: ''Kingsport Victory''}} After arriving in Rota 26 October and completing additional experiments she sailed for Norfolk 9 November and arrived 21 November.{{sfn|Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships: ''Kingsport Victory''}}

''Kingsport'' departed for the Pacific 17 February 1964 via Puerto Rico and the Panama Canal stopping at San Diego 13 March and reaching Pearl Harbor on 25 March 1964. For the next ten months the ship operated between  Pearl Harbor and Guam supporting further communication experiments including those related to the evaluation of SYNCOM 3 after its launching 19 August 1964. Further experiments extended throughout the Western Pacific and into the Indian Ocean until July 1965.{{sfn|Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships: ''Kingsport Victory''}}

She then provided support for NASA's Gemini manned space shots serving as on station communications ship between Okinawa and the Philippines for [[Gemini 5]] from 21 to 29 August. She supported three more Gemini flights between 4 December and 16 March 1966 before returning to the West Coast in April. She remained at San Francisco from 18 April to 27 October in a ready reserve status. During November she steamed to the East Coast, and in early 1967 was at New York undergoing repairs and alterations.{{sfn|Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships: ''Kingsport Victory''}}

===Survey ship===
After completion of her communications support role the USNS ''Kingsport'' became a bathymetric and acoustic survey ship supporting undersea surveillance.{{sfn|Hanish, Rollins &amp; Cybulski}}{{sfn|Fenner &amp; Cronin|p=3}} Among the now published reports,  declassified in 2006, of the ship's work is a description of the Indian Ocean exercise code named BEARING STAKE that took place from January to April 1977.{{sfn|Fenner &amp; Cronin|p=Foreword}}

==Disposal==
Kingsport was placed out of service on 31 Jan 1984, transferred to the Maritime Administration for layup on 29 August 1984 then transferred back to the Military Sealift Command for scientific research on 1 March 1990.{{sfn|NavSource}} The ship was withdrawn from the reserve fleet on 21 January 1992 for scrapping in India.{{sfn|MARAD Vessel Status Card: ''Kingsport'' (AG-164)}}

==Honors==
Crew of Naval Armed Guard on the SS ''Kingsport Victory''' earned "[[Battle Stars]]" in World War II for war action during the assault occupation of Assault occupation of Iwo Jima from 13 March 1945 to 16 March 1945.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive-org.com/org/u/usmm.org/2013-04-03_1808202_35/World_War_II_Posters_Train_or_return_to_sea/ usmm.org, "Battle Stars" in World War II.]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''VBS2''' ('''Virtual Battlespace 2''') is the successor of the battlefield simulation system [[VBS1]]. It was developed in close cooperation with the [[USMC]], [[Australian Defence Force]] and other military customers of VBS1. VBS2 was officially launched on 17 April 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vbs2.com/site/press_vbs_lch.html Bohemia Interactive announces the official release of VBS2]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Information==

VBS2 offers realistic [[virtual battlefield|battlefield simulations]] and the ability to operate land, sea, and air vehicles. Instructors may create new scenarios and then engage the simulation from multiple viewpoints. The squad-management system enables participants to issue orders to squad members.

VBS2 was designed for federal, state, and local government agencies and can be specifically tailored to meet the individual needs of military, law enforcement, [[homeland defense]], [[loadmaster]], and [[first responder]] training environments.

VBS2 may be used to teach doctrine, [[military tactics|tactics]], techniques, and procedures during [[squad]] and [[platoon]] [[Offensive (military)|offensive]], [[Defense (military)|defensive]], and [[patrolling]] operations. VBS2 delivers a synthetic environment for the practical exercise of the [[leadership]] and organizational behavior skills required to successfully execute unit missions.

VBS2 is suitable for training small teams in urban tactics, entire combat teams in [[combined arms]] operations or even non-military usage such as emergency response procedures in lethal and non-lethal environments or terrain visualization.

VBS2 is based on the VBS2[[Real Virtuality (engine)|Real Virtuality]] 2, also used in the video game [[Arma 2]].

==Technology==

The simulation engine driving VBS2 is [[Real Virtuality (engine)|Real Virtuality]] 2, developed by [[Bohemia Interactive]]. VBS2 allows a user to develop large terrain areas, over {{convert|10,000|km2}} in size (at any terrain resolution) and populate the terrain area with millions of objects in accordance with VMAP shape data, and then texture-map the entire representation with high-resolution satellite imagery or aerial photography.

Once the terrain representation is exported into VBS2, the simulation engine will provide a simulation of the real world, incorporating moving trees and grass, ground clutter, ambient animal life, shadows, dynamic lighting, weather and time of day.

A new streaming capability provides an efficient means of loading complex terrain areas as object and texture data is processed only when required. View distances are now typically five times greater than in [[VBS1]] (depending on [[CPU|processor]] speed) – [[culling (computer graphics)|level of detail cull]]ing has been improved to allow [[attack helicopter]]s and armoured vehicles to engage at realistic ranges, and [[forward observer]]s to call [[artillery]] fire from greater distances.

==Features==

VBS2 supports large [[Multiplayer video game|multiplayer]] network sessions allowing [[join-in-progress]] and improved administrator functionality. VBS2 provides improved simulation of complex urban areas, including destructible buildings, round penetration through walls and operable and destructible doors. Weapon platforms are capable of thermal imaging, simulation of fire control systems and turret override. Multiple vehicle turrets are possible. Weapon [[ballistics]] have been improved.

The After-Action-Review module allows detailed review of a completed training mission, with every player, AI, vehicle movement being recorded, as well as any bullet path and any destruction to objects or terrain.

The VBS2 terrain editing tool, Visitor 3, will support direct import of terrain and shape data to recreate any area of operation in the simulation. VBS2 also includes real-time [[command and control]] functionality for large numbers of AI or human participants.

The VBS1 [[High level architecture (simulation)|HLA]]/[[Distributed Interactive Simulation|DIS]] gateway is updated and improved for VBS2 to meet HLA and DIS compliance.

==History==

In 2001, Bohemia Interactive Australia (BIA) was formed to take Operation Flashpoint and develop a militarised version suitable for Tactical training. By late 2001, the US Marine Corps was provided an alpha version of VBS1 and from their feedback, the after actions review (AAR) tool was added. The Australian Army used VBS1 for experimentation in 2003 and training trials in 2004 with the software being accepted, in 2005, as an Infantry and combined arms operations training tool.
In 2006 Calytrix Technologies developed LVCGame as a HLA and DIS gateway for VBS to allow constructive simulation entities and VBS entities to interact in wider exercises. VBS2 was released in beta in early 2007 and trialed as part of the ADF's Combined Arms Tactical Training (CATT) events. BIA then used feedback from both the ADF and USMC to finalize VBS2 throughout 2007 with the Virtual Tool Kit addition being released in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.simulationaustralia.org.au/archive/simtect/2007/Abstracts/97.html |title=SimTecT 2007 - The Evolution of 1st-Person Trainers: A Case-Study with VBS and HLA Integration |publisher=Simulationaustralia.org.au |date=2007-01-17 |accessdate=2013-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In January 2009 the [[United States Army]] announced a new training program of record called Games for Training (GFT).  VBS2 was selected as the first person simulation flagship for the GFT program.  This announcement replaced a DARPA initiative known as [[DARWARS Ambush! Convoy Simulator]] which was subsequently retired as a training tool. Games for Training is currently managed by the TRADOC Capability Manager Gaming, located at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas.

'''Vladimir Aleksandrovich Kotelnikov''' ([[russian language|Russian]] ''Владимир Александрович Котельников'', scientific transliteration ''Vladimir Alexandrovič Kotelnikov'', 6 September 1908 in [[Kazan]] – 11 February 2005 in [[Moscow]]) was an [[information theory]] and [[radar astronomy]] pioneer from the [[Soviet Union]].  He was elected a member of the Russian Academy of Science, in the Department of Technical Science (radio technology) in 1953. From 30 July 1973 to 25 March 1980 Kotelnikov served as Chairman of the RSFSR Supreme Council.

He is mostly known for having discovered, before e.g. [[Edmund Whittaker]], [[Harry Nyquist]], [[Claude Shannon]], the [[sampling theorem]] in 1933. 
&lt;ref&gt;Kotelnikov VA, ''On the transmission capacity of "ether" and wire in electrocommunications'', [http://ict.open.ac.uk/classics/1.pdf (English translation, PDF)], Izd. Red. Upr. Svyazzi RKKA (1933), Reprint in ''[http://www.ieeta.pt/~pjf/MSTMA/ Modern Sampling Theory: Mathematics and Applications]'', Editors: J. J. Benedetto und PJSG Ferreira, Birkhauser (Boston) 2000,  {{ISBN|0-8176-4023-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
This result of [[Fourier Analysis]] was known in [[harmonic analysis]] since the end of the 19th century and circulated in the 1920s and 1930s in the engineering community.  He was the first to write down a precise statement of this theorem in relation to signal transmission. He also was a pioneer in the use of [[signal theory]] in modulation and communications.

He is also a creator of the '''theory of optimum noise immunity'''.&lt;ref&gt;Kotelnikov VA, ''The Theory of Optimum Noise Immunity'' (monograph), Russia 1956, US 1959&lt;/ref&gt; 
He obtained several scientific prizes for his work in [[radio astronomy]] and [[signal theory]].  In 1961, he oversaw one of the first efforts to probe the planet [[Venus]] with radar. In June 1962 he led the first probe of the [[Mercury (planet)|planet Mercury]] with radar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=J. V. |last=Evans |author2=Brockelman, R. A. |author3=Henry, J.

Kotelnikov was also involved in [[cryptography]], proving  the  absolute security of the [[one-time pad]]; his results were delivered in 1941, the time of Nazi Germany's invasion of the Soviet Union, in a report that apparently remains classified.&lt;ref name="kotelnikov"&gt;{{cite journal

For his achievements Kotelnikov was awarded the [[IEEE]] 2000 Gold Medal of Alexander Graham Bell and the honorable IEEE Third Millennium Medal. Prof. Bruce Eisenstein, the President of the IEEE, described Kotelnikov as follows: "The outstanding hero of the present. His merits are recognized all over the
world. In front of us is the giant of radio engineering thought, who has made the most significant contribution to media communication development". {{Citation needed|date=May 2014}}
