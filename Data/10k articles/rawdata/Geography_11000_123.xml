The '''A595''' is a [[primary route]] in [[Cumbria]], in [[Northern England]] that starts in [[Carlisle, Cumbria|Carlisle]], passes through [[Whitehaven]] and goes close to [[Workington]], [[Cockermouth]] and [[Wigton]]. It passes [[Sellafield]] and [[Ravenglass]] before ending at the [[Dalton-in-Furness]] by-pass, in southern Cumbria, where it joins the [[A590 road|A590]] trunk road. The road is mostly [[single carriageway]], apart from in central Carlisle, where it passes the [[Carlisle Castle|castle]] as a busy [[dual carriageway]] road named Castle Way, and prior to that as Bridge Street and Church Street, where it passes close to the [[McVitie's]] or [[Carr's]] [[biscuit]] factory. The Lillyhall bypass is also dual carriageway.

The road in the [[Whitehaven]] area was laid out in the 1930s and the A595 was designated a trunk route in 1946. It was detrunked in 1998, apart from an {{Convert|18|mi|adj=on}} section between Little Clifton and [[Calder Bridge]]. This section represents the route from [[Sellafield]] to the [[A66 road (England)|A66]].

At Dove Ford in Grizebeck the road passes through a farmyard.

==Route==

===Northern section===
The {{convert|85|mi|adj=on}} long A595 is also known as the Cumbrian Coast Road despite much of the road following in an inland route. Starting at the Hardwicke Circus roundabout junction with the [[A7 road (Great Britain)|A7]] in [[Carlisle, Cumbria|Carlisle]], it forms a short section of dual carriageway known as Castle Way. This section passes [[Carlisle Castle]] and [[Tullie House]]. Prior to the construction of Castle Way, the road was split in 2 at this section. It then continues over Caldew Bridge to a thoroughfare called Caldewgate, before arriving at a roundabout close to the [[McVitie's]] factory in the city centre. It then follows the route of Wigton Road through the district of Morton, before reaching the outer boundary of Carlisle. At this point it passes the proposed start point of the Carlisle Northern Development Route, where construction work commenced in 2009. This route will be the A689.&lt;ref name="sabre-roads"&gt;http://www.sabre-roads.org.uk/wiki/index.php?title=A595&lt;/ref&gt; A further roundabout was constructed in 2011 around 1 mile south of Carlisle in anticipation of increased traffic for a nearby garden centre development.

The route continues in a south-westerly direction until it reaches a roundabout on the outskirts of [[Thursby]] at a junction with [[A596 road|A596]]. The roads previously met in the centre of the village of Thursby, before the construction of the Thursby bypass in the 1980s. The A595 runs largely parallel to [[A596]], before the [[A596]] terminates in Workington.&lt;ref name="sabre-roads" /&gt;

The road then continues in a southerly direction, passing close to the town of [[Wigton]]. A staggered crossroads at the section provides access to Wigton and also the [[B5305 road|B5305]] towards [[Penrith, Cumbria|Penrith]]. The twin transmitters of [[Caldbeck]] and [[Sandale transmitting station|Sandale]] are visible close to this section of the road.&lt;ref name="sabre-roads" /&gt;

The next section follows a meandering path through several hamlets, before reaching the village of [[Bothel, Cumbria|Bothel]], where the [[A591]] from [[Keswick, Cumbria|Keswick]] terminates. The road then passes the site of the former Moota motel. This section of the route is notable for the two long straight sections, which are fairly rare on the A595. The road once again meanders until the roundabout junction with the [[A594 road (Cumbria)|A594]] road from [[Cockermouth]] to [[Maryport]]. It then passes over the [[River Derwent, Cumbria|River Derwent]] via Papcastle Bridge before turning west and becoming the part of the [[A66 road (England)|A66]] until Little Clifton. During the [[2009 Great Britain and Ireland floods|2009 Cumbrian floods]], the Papcastle bridge was briefly closed, essentially splitting [[West Cumbria]] in two. With bridge collapses and damage on the nearby [[A596]], and a road closure on the [[A591]], the only passable route to anywhere north of the River Derwent was via the [[A66 road|A66]] and [[M6 motorway|M6]] to [[Carlisle, Cumbria|Carlisle]] - a diversion of over {{convert|90|mi}}.&lt;ref name="sabre-roads" /&gt;

At this point the road turns towards Lillyhall, passing through Lillyhall Industrial Estate and joining the [[Distington]] bypass, constructed in 2008. This section of road is notable as it is the only section of national speed limit dual carriageway along the whole length of the road. The end of the dual carriageway section is a roundabout junction near [[Lowca]] rejoining the original A595 road. It is then a short journey along the coast to the edge of [[Whitehaven]].&lt;ref name="sabre-roads" /&gt;

===Southern section===
The road passes through Loop Road North &amp; Loop Road South in [[Whitehaven]] passing the suburbs of the Highlands, Hill Crest and [[Hensingham]]. It forms the [[Hensingham]] bypass at this section, constructed in the 1980s to ease the passage of construction traffic to [[Sellafield]] through a particularly narrow and busy section of the road. It then passes close to [[West Cumberland Hospital]] and West Lakes Science &amp; Technology Park. There is a campaign to build a bypass from the recently built [[Distington]] Bypass to this part of the A595 to ease congestion in the [[Whitehaven]] area.&lt;ref name="sabre-roads" /&gt;

After this, the road the passes near to [[Moor Row]] and through the centre of Bigrigg, before heading downhill to [[Egremont, Cumbria|Egremont]]. The northbound side of the road here was upgraded in the 1980s to provide an extra uphill lane for overtaking due to the steep gradient. At the bottom of the hill the roundabout forms a junction with the B5086 which gives access to [[Cleator Moor]] and eventually [[Cockermouth]].&lt;ref name="sabre-roads" /&gt;

The A595 the forms the [[Egremont, Cumbria|Egremont]] bypass. This bypass was built in the early '90s as a result of an investment by [[BNFL]] in local infrastructure following the siting of the THORP reprocessing plant at [[Sellafield]]. Prior to the bypass, the A595 originally passed right through the middle of town of Egremont. Once past the village of Thornhill, you can then see the sprawling [[Sellafield]] nuclear site. Twin cooling towers previously dominated the skyline here. However, they were demolished in 2007.&lt;ref name="sabre-roads" /&gt;

The road then passes [[Beckermet]] and [[Calder Bridge]], junctions here give access to the [[Sellafield]] site. From Calder Bridge, the A595 forms the boundary of the [[Lake District National Park]], going between the villages of [[Seascale]] and [[Gosforth, Cumbria|Gosforth]]. It enters the national park at the bridge over the [[River Irt]] at Holmrook and continues past the village of [[Ravenglass]], then passes through [[Waberthwaite, Cumbria|Waberthwaite]] and [[Bootle, Cumbria|Bootle]] and round the foot of [[Black Combe]].&lt;ref name="sabre-roads" /&gt;&lt;ref name="OS OL6"&gt;{{cite map | title = The English Lakes South-Western Area: OL6|date = March 2015|scale = 1:25,000|series = OS Explorer|publisher = [[Ordnance Survey]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At Silecroft the road has a [[List of road-related terminology#T|TOTSO]] (turn off to stay on) junction with the [[A5093 road|A5093]], close to the town of [[Millom]], taking a north-easterly route up the Whicham Valley. For much of this stretch, the road is close to or is the boundary of the Lake District National Park. At [[Duddon Bridge]], which previously marked the southern boundary of the historic county of [[Cumberland]], the road turns towards [[Broughton-in-Furness]] but bypasses the town, before turning north to rejoin its old route, then once again turning south. At Grizebeck, the [[A5092 road|A5092]] then branches off the road to connect with the [[A590]], providing the route to the [[M6 motorway|M6]]. This is also the point at which the A595 ceases to be the boundary to the Lake District National Park.&lt;ref name="sabre-roads" /&gt;{{r|OS OL6}}

The road finally passes through [[Kirkby-in-Furness]] and [[Askam-in-Furness]] before terminating {{convert|1.8|mi}} further south at a roundabout junction with the [[A590]] on the [[Dalton-in-Furness]] bypass.&lt;ref name="sabre-roads" /&gt;

The last section of the road is particularly narrow and even passes through a farmyard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Residents asked how to improve the A595 |url=http://www.nwemail.co.uk/news/residents-asked-how-to-improve-the-a595-1.741880? |accessdate=20 January 2011 |newspaper=North West Evening Mail |date=3 August 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121005172450/http://www.nwemail.co.uk/news/residents-asked-how-to-improve-the-a595-1.741880 |archivedate=5 October 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Safety==

The road, along with the A66, is considered to be the most dangerous road in Cumbria.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesandstar.co.uk/1.143669 Times &amp; Star - Detrunked A595 more dangerous] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719185210/http://www.timesandstar.co.uk/1.143669 |date=19 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are several accident blackspots along the length of the road. One of the most notable is a stretch known as Moota, which is regularly the scene of fatal accidents.&lt;ref&gt;[http://newsandstar.co.uk/news/1.223747 News &amp; Star - Cyclist badly hurt in A595 crash] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110823054435/http://newsandstar.co.uk/news/1.223747 |date=23 August 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The northern section was formerly a trunk road, but until the recent completion of the [[Distington]] Bypass it had only one small section of dual carriageway. The southern section of the road around New Mill does not have a secondary route. When this section is closed due to an accident or roadworks, the detour routes are via Wrynose and Hardknott mountain passes for cars, and via the M6 J40 for HGVs, the latter being a detour of {{convert|120|mi}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.whitehavennews.co.uk/news/1.272246 Whitehaven News - A595 closure causes major disruption] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110924124635/http://www.whitehavennews.co.uk/news/1.272246 |date=24 September 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The poor safety record of the road is highlighted by signs erected on the route stating "1245 casualties in 5 years".

==Road schemes==

===Carlisle Northern Development Route (A689)===
The '''Carlisle Northern Development Route''' (CNDR) is a proposed {{convert|4|mi|adj=on}} long north-western [[bypass (road)|bypass]] of Carlisle, which would replace the existing A595 through the city (Wigton Road, Church Street, Bridge Street and Castle Way) and reduce congestion on the city's roads. The new road would be of single carriageway standard, with a number of [[roundabout]] junctions, as well as a new bridge over the [[River Eden, Cumbria|River Eden]]. The route would begin near Newby West (to the west of the city), before meeting the B5307 (the road to [[Abbeytown]]). Shortly afterwards it would cross over the River Eden, and curve round to the north of the Kingstown Industrial Estate, and terminate at Junction 44 of the [[M6 motorway]].

The development of the route has suffered several setbacks. In August 2008 a discovery of a [[great crested newt]] colony led to a delay in the start of the project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsandstar.co.uk/news/1.216566 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-06-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090510071558/http://www.newsandstar.co.uk/news/1.216566 |archivedate=10 May 2009 |df=dmy }} - Great crested newts delay Carlisle bypass&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2009 a potentially important [[Stone Age]] find was discovered during surveying work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsandstar.co.uk/stone_age_finds_delay_carlisle_bypass_again_1_519575?referrerPath%3Dhome%2Fnews_star_search_results_page_2_1962 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-06-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090504095145/http://www.newsandstar.co.uk/stone_age_finds_delay_carlisle_bypass_again_1_519575?referrerPath=home%2Fnews_star_search_results_page_2_1962 |archivedate=4 May 2009 |df=dmy }} - Stone Age find delays bypass again&lt;/ref&gt; The most serious problem to face the development was the near collapse of the bank providing the funds under a [[private finance initiative]]. Belgian bank [[Dexia]] was involved in a £5 billion bailout during the [[Credit Crunch]]. A consortium of banks later stepped in to provide the funding, and construction is currently underway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsandstar.co.uk/stone_age_finds_delay_carlisle_bypass_again_1_519575?referrerPath%3Dhome%2Fnews_star_search_results_page_2_1962 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-06-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090504095145/http://www.newsandstar.co.uk/stone_age_finds_delay_carlisle_bypass_again_1_519575?referrerPath=home%2Fnews_star_search_results_page_2_1962 |archivedate=4 May 2009 |df=dmy }} Funding problems for bypass&lt;/ref&gt;
The bypass opened in Spring 2012.

===Parton to Lillyhall improvements===

The Parton to Lillyhall bypass was opened in December 2008 after a period of 18 months construction. The road runs from the junction with the [[A596 road|A596]] at Lillyhall to a new junction created close to the A595 junction for Lowca. The new road replaces a winding, narrow section of the A595 which passed through the village of Distington. Prior to this project the A595 was considered for de-trunking, meaning the scheme would have become the responsibility of Cumbria County Council. However, it was not de-trunked, and has instead been listed in the government's [https://web.archive.org/web/20070527191510/http://www.highways.gov.uk/roads/projects/7393.aspx Targeted Programme of Improvements].

===Whitehaven Eastern Relief Road===

[[Copeland (UK Parliament constituency)|Copeland]] MP [[Jamie Reed]] and [[Cumbria]] County Council leader Stewart Young have been pressing the UK government for an eastern relief road to take the A595 away from a bottleneck through the town of [[Whitehaven]]. The proposed route would connect with recent Parton to Lillyhall bypass, it would then pass to the east of the town, past the newly proposed replacement for West Cumberland Hospital, then finally passing West Lakes Science &amp; Technology Park before joining the current A595 south of [[Whitehaven]]. Plans are being drawn up as part of the Energy Coast masterplan to regenerate West Cumbria.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newsandstar.co.uk/news/1.509367 News &amp; Star - Plan for £40 million Whitehaven bypass] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090207152755/http://www.newsandstar.co.uk/news/1.509367 |date=7 February 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
'''Active Design - England'''

[http://www.sportengland.org Sport England] considers that the built environment has a vital role to play to encourage people to be physically active as part of their daily lives, enabling communities to lead more active and healthy lifestyles.  In 2007 Sport England and [http://www.davidlock.com David Lock Associates] produced [https://www.sportengland.org/media/3213/active-design.pdf Active Design], which provided a set of design guidelines to help promote opportunities for sport and physical activity in the design and layout of new development.  The guidance was developed in two phases,  [https://www.sportengland.org/media/12186/active-design-phase-1-sept-2005.pdf phase one] (2005) developed the three key Active Design objects of - improving Accessibility, enhancing Amenity and increasing Awareness (The 3 A’s). Phase two included two stakeholder sessions ([https://www.sportengland.org/media/12184/active-design-stakeholder-session-1-may-2006.pdf May] &amp; [https://www.sportengland.org/media/12185/active-design-stakeholder-session-2-oct-2006.pdf October] 2006) which expanded ‘The 3 A’s’ into a criterion based approach. These criteria formed the guidance which was published in 2007. The guidance was supported by CABE, Department of Health and Department for Culture Media and Sport.

In 2014, Sport England held a stakeholder session made up of a range of bodies and individuals including Urban Planning and Public Health professionals to discuss whether Active Design was still relevant in today’s planning and health context. The clear message from the stakeholder session was that there was still a role for Active Design to play in today’s planning and health environment.  The guide was revised, retaining ‘The 3 A’s’ and refining the criteria based approach to the Ten Principles of Active Design. The revised [http://www.sportengland.org/activedesign Active Design](prepared by [http://www.sportengland.com Sport England] and [http://www.davidlock.com David Lock Associates]) was published in 2015, and was supported by Public Health England.

In 2016 Active Design: ''Planning for health and wellbeing through sport and physical activity'' was shortlisted for an award at the Royal Town Planning Institute (RTPI) Awards for Planning Excellence. Active Design was shortlisted in the category of ''Excellence in Planning for Community and Wellbeing''.&lt;ref&gt;Royal Town Planning Institute - Excellence In Planning Awards 2016 short list   http://rtpi.org.uk/briefing-room/news-releases/2016/february/over-60-projects-and-people-from-uk-and-around-the-world-competing-for-top-planning-award/&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017 Sport England prepared two animated films, [https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=1&amp;v=mDaVBh1Bs7Y Active Design by Sport England] and [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRCJ4JL_LjM The Ten Principles of Active Design], in addition to three further Case Studies. The animations and case studies are available on [https://www.sportengland.org/facilities-planning/active-design/ Sport Englands Active Design webpage].

The Active Design principles are becoming increasingly embedded into Built Environment practice and placemaking design, with a growing list of Local Authorities in England making reference to Sport England’s Active Design guidance in planning policy. In 2018 Active Design was embedded into the principles of the revised [https://www.essexdesignguide.co.uk/overarching-themes/active-design-principles/ Essex Design Guide] (prepared by Essex County Council and supported by Sport England).

'''Active Design - New York'''

Recognizing that physical inactivity was a significant factor in decreased life spans, notably because it promoted obesity, high blood pressure and high blood glucose, all precursors of early death, those responsible for planning in New York City developed a set of guidelines that, ''[[inter alia]]'', they hoped would promote health by promoting physical activity.  They released these guidelines in January 2010.&lt;ref name="Lee-1"&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Lee, Karen K. |year=2012 |title=Developing and implementng the active design guidelines in New York City |journal=Health &amp; Place |volume=18 |issue=1 |pages=5–7 |doi=10.1016/j.healthplace.2011.09.009|pmid=22243901 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The guidelines were also based on concerns about building longevity and ecological costs, which is generally known as "[[sustainable design]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Active Design |publisher=New York City Department of Design and Construction |url=http://www1.nyc.gov/site/ddc/about/active-design.page |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161207171211/http://www1.nyc.gov/site/ddc/about/active-design.page |archivedate=7 December 2016 |deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; Impetus for the guidelines began in 2006 with the NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH) who then partnered with the [[American Institute of Architects]] New York Chapter to hold a series of conferences known as the "Fit City" conferences.&lt;ref name="AIA-NYC-FC10" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Lee-1" /&gt;

Four key concepts came out of this process:&lt;ref name="Lacasse" /&gt;
:#Buildings should encourages greater physical movement within them for users and visitors
:#Cities should provide recreational spaces that are accessible and encourage physical activity for a variety of ages, interests, and abilities&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Thompson, Catharine Ward |year=2013 |title=Activity, exercise and the planning and design of outdoor spaces |journal=Journal of Environmental Psychology |volume=34 |pages=79–96 |doi=10.1016/j.jenvp.2013.01.003|url=https://www.pure.ed.ac.uk/ws/files/42218978/Ward_Thompson_Aspinall_Activity_Exercise_Outdoor_Spaces_Author_preprintJEP2013.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;
:#Transportation systems in cities should encourage physical activity and should protect non-motor vehicle use
:#Cities, market areas and buildings should provide ready access to food and healthy eating environments &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Huang |first1=Terry T. K. |display-authors=etal |year=2013 |title=Peer Reviewed: Healthy Eating Design Guidelines for School Architecture |journal=Preventing Chronic Disease |volume=10 |pages=E27 |pmc=3592783 |doi=10.5888/pcd10.120084 |pmid=23449281}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From New York City the active design movement spread throughout the United States&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite magazine|author=Millard, Bill |year=2010 |title=Active Design Approaches Critical Mass |location=New York|magazine=Oculus |volume=72 |issue= |pages= |url=http://main.aiany.org/eOCULUS/newsletter/active-design-approaches-critical-mass/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite magazine|author=Millard, Bill |year=2012 |title=Active Design - urban bones, human muscles: in Spain, Italy, NYC, and elsewhere, architects and their multidisciplinary partners are reshaping the built environment to improve health using research, outreach, and site-specific, scale-specific creativity |location=New York|magazine=Oculus |volume=74 |issue=4 |pages=24–27 |url=http://www.nxtbook.com/nxtbooks/naylor/ARCQ0113/index.php#/24 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161213215007/http://www.nxtbook.com/nxtbooks/naylor/ARCQ0113/index.php#/24 |archivedate=13 December 2016 |deadurl=no |df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Goals==
{{unreferenced section|date=December 2016}}
Sickness can lead to not working efficiently and effectively. Ineffective workers in the work force cause harm to the company and the people in the community. Active design strives to impact public health not only physically but also mentally and socially. For example, active design in transportation supports a safe and vibrant environment for pedestrians, cyclists and transit riders. It creates buildings that encourage greater physical movement within a building by both users and visitors. The active design of recreation sites shapes play and activity spaces for people of different ages, interests, and abilities. Also, improved food accessibility can improve nutrition in communities that need it the most.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

==Effects==
There are few studies of the effects of implementing active design concepts, but they are in general agreement that the physical activity of occupants is increased. Moving to an active design building seemed to have physical health benefits for workers, but workers’ perceptions on productivity about the new work environment have varied. A study reported that staff moved into an active design building decreased the time spent sitting by 1.2h/day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Wang, Zhe |year=2014 |title=Nearby outdoor environments and seniors physical activities |journal=Frontiers of Architectural Research |volume=3 |issue=3 |pages=265–270 |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2095263514000211 |doi=10.1016/j.foar.2014.04.002}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was no significant increase in self-rated quality of work or work related motivation but there was no negative feedback in these areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Engelen |first1=L. |display-authors=etal |year=2016 |title=Do active design buildings change health behaviour and workplace perceptions? |journal=Occupational Medicine |volume=66 |issue=5 |pages=408–411 |url=http://0-occmed.oxfordjournals.org.ignacio.usfca.edu/content/66/5/408.full.pdf |subscription=yes |doi=10.1093/occmed/kqv213|pmid=26769894 |pmc=4913362 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implementation==
Active design concepts may be applied in remodeling or repurposing existing buildings and landscapes. Some elements include widening sidewalks and crosswalks; installing traffic calming elements that slow driving speeds; making stairs that are accessible, visible, attractive, and well-lit; making recreation areas, such as parks, plazas, and playgrounds, more accessible by pedestrians and cyclists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Our approach to Active Design |publisher=Center for Active Design |url=https://centerforactivedesign.org/ourapproach }}&lt;/ref&gt; People would be more likely to be active if places for recreation were within walking distance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first1=Jawald |last1=Haider |first2=Peter |last2=Aeschbacher |first3=Mallika |last3=Bose |first4=Danielle |last4=Rivera |year=2013 |title=Active living in small town America: an approach to parks and recreation planning and design |journal=Studies in the History of Gardens &amp; Designed Landscapes |volume=33 |issue=4 |pages=345–359 |doi=10.1080/14601176.2013.820922 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are a number of concerns with the adoption of active design programmes. Developing communities are not always accepting of new forms of architecture and living. Integration of active design may come in conflict with making sure historical culture survives. Vernacular architecture may be abandoned due to it being considered insufficient or uncomfortable.&lt;ref&gt;http://0-eds.a.ebscohost.com.ignacio.usfca.edu/eds/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=f05c2c1b-356f-4bce-800d-13c3aeecda9e%40sessionmgr4010&amp;vid=1&amp;hid=4210 (Unknown document)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Future==
The future of active design may be to further incorporate requirements into law, as in the city of New York which set active design guidelines to improve public health in the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=City of New York |year=2010 |title=Active Design Guidelines: Promoting Physical Actitity and Heath in Design |publisher=Center for Active Design |location=New York City |url=https://centerforactivedesign.org/dl/guidelines.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1957">'''Adolf Schenck''' (April 4, 1857 – September 15, 1936) was a German [[geographer]], [[mineralogist]] and [[botanist]] who was a native of [[Siegen]]. He was a brother to botanist [[Heinrich Schenck]] (1860-1927).

Schenck studied at the Universities of [[University of Berlin|Berlin]] and [[University of Bonn|Bonn]], obtaining his doctorate in 1884. From 1884 to 1887 he was a geographer on a mineralogical expedition to [[German Southwest Africa]]. The expedition was organized by merchant [[Adolf Lüderitz]] (1834-1886) and was under the leadership of Karl Höpfner (1857-1900). Several noted scientists participated in the venture, including Swiss botanist [[Hans Schinz]] (1868-1941), who performed botanical investigations in the northern part of German Southwest Africa. In the southern part of the colony, Schenck collected minerals and plants, particularly [[lichen]]s. Prior to returning to Germany, he visited mines and goldfields that are now located in the present-day nations of South Africa, Botswana and Mozambique.

From 1899 to 1922 he was a professor at the [[University of Halle]], and continued working as a lecturer until 1932. As a teacher he gave lectures on the [[geography]] of German colonies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catalogus-professorum-halensis.de/schenckadolf.html Adolf Schenck] Catalogus Professorum Halensis&lt;/ref&gt; Schenck has a handful of African [[spermatophyte]] species named after him.

The Alpide belt is being created by ongoing [[plate tectonics]] such as the [[Alpine orogeny]]. The belt is the result of [[Mesozoic]]-to-[[Cenozoic]]-to-recent closure of the [[Tethys Ocean]] and process of collision between the northward-moving [[African plate|African]], [[Arabian plate|Arabian]] and [[Indian plate]]s with the [[Eurasian plate]].&lt;ref name=Storetvedt/&gt;

The province's average elevation is less than 900 meters above sea level and extends some 50 to 100 kilometers inland from the ocean.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}  The coastal plain is normally  wet, including many rivers, [[marsh]], and [[swampland]].{{Citation needed|reason=This seems unbelievable since most of the land is farmable.|date=December 2008}} There are no [[hill]]s or [[mountain]]s in this region of North America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.study.com/academy/lesson/atlantic-coastal-plain-lesson-for-kids.html|title=Atlantic Coastal Plain Lesson for Kids - Study.com|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is composed primarily of [[sedimentary rock]] and [[diagenesis|unlithified]] [[sediment]]s and is primarily used for [[agriculture]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://ddr.nal.usda.gov/bitstream/10113/18162/1/IND20441752.pdf Water table management in the eastern coastal plain] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721072047/http://ddr.nal.usda.gov/bitstream/10113/18162/1/IND20441752.pdf |date=July 21, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The area is subdivided into the [[United States physiographic region|Embayed and Sea Island physiographic provinces]], as well as the [[Mid-Atlantic states|Mid-Atlantic]] and [[South Atlantic States|South Atlantic]] coastal plains.

A '''commune''' ({{lang-es|comuna}}, {{IPA-es|koˈmuna|IPA}}) is the smallest administrative subdivision in [[Chile]]. It may contain [[City|cities]], [[town]]s, [[village]]s, [[Hamlet (place)|hamlets]] as well as [[rural]] areas.  In highly populated areas, such as [[Santiago, Chile|Santiago]], [[Valparaíso]] and [[Concepción, Chile|Concepción]], a conurbation may be broken into several communes. In sparsely populated areas, conversely, a commune may cover a substantial rural area together with several settled areas which could range from hamlets to towns or cities.

The term "commune" is ambiguous in English, but the word is commonly used in translation for "comuna."   A comuna is similar to a "county" in Anglo-American usage and practice.

Each commune  is governed by a [[direct election|directly elected]] body known as a municipal council (''concejo municipal'') consisting of a mayor (''alcalde'') and a group of councillors (''concejales''), for a period of four years. The communal civil service administration is known as the [[municipality]] (''[[municipalidad]]'') and is headquartered at the mayor's office (''alcaldía''). According to Chilean law, a single municipality may administer one or more communes, though currently, the only such case is the municipality of [[Cabo de Hornos, Chile|Cabo de Hornos]], which administers the communes of [[Antártica (commune)|Antártica]] and [[Cabo de Hornos, Chile|Cabo de Hornos]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leychile.cl/Navegar?idNorma=185661 Law 19,726]&lt;/ref&gt;

Chile's 346 communes are grouped into 54 [[Provinces of Chile|provinces]] (''provincia'', pl. ''provincias''), which are themselves grouped into 16 [[Regions of Chile|regions]] (''región'', pl. ''regiones'').

==List of communes by region and province==
Traditionally, Chilean regions are listed in geographical order starting with the northernmost region, leaving the Santiago Metropolitan Region at the end. The following table lists all Chilean communes, providing a complete list of administrative divisions at all levels. Each commune's municipality website is given along with the area and population from the [[National Statistics Institute (Chile)|National Statistics Institute]]'s most recent census conducted in 2002.

'''Environmental geology''', like [[hydrogeology]], is an applied science concerned with the practical application of the principles of geology in the solving of environmental problems. It is a multidisciplinary field that is closely related to [[engineering geology]] and, to a lesser extent, to [[environmental geography]]. Each of these fields involves the study of the interaction of humans with the [[geologic]] environment, including the [[biosphere]], the [[lithosphere]], the [[hydrosphere]], and to some extent the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]]. In other words, environmental geology is the application of geological information to solve conflicts, minimizing possible adverse [[environmental degradation]] or maximizing possible advantageous condition resulting from the use of natural and modified environment.
 
Environmental geology includes:

* managing geological and hydrogeological resources such as [[fossil fuel]]s, [[mineral]]s, [[water (molecule)|water]] (surface and [[ground water]]), and [[land use]]. 
* studying the earth's surface through the disciplines of [[geomorphology]], and [[edaphology]];
* defining and mitigating exposure of natural hazards on humans 
* managing industrial and domestic waste disposal and minimizing or eliminating effects of [[pollution]], and 
* performing associated activities, often involving litigation.

A peer-reviewed journal in the field is ''[[Environmental Earth Sciences]]'' ({{ISSN|1866-6280}}),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = Environmental Earth Sciences | publisher = Springer | url = https://www.springer.com/earth+sciences+and+geography/geology/journal/12665 | accessdate = 2010-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; formerly ''Environmental Geology'' ({{ISSN|0943-0105}}).

This is a list of the extreme points of the [[European Union]] — the points that are farther north, south, east or west than any other location.

==In Europe==
[[File:Northernmost point in European Union.jpg|thumb|right|Border marker at the road near the northernmost point of the European Union near [[Nuorgam]], [[Finland]]. There is a marker also at the exact point at the river.]]

* North: [[Nuorgam]], [[Finland]] (70° 5’ 30” N)
* South: [[El Pinar, Santa Cruz de Tenerife]], [[Spain]] (27°42′05″N).

* East: [[Rizokarpaso]], [[Cyprus]] ''de jure''&lt;ref name="Cyprus 1"&gt;[[Rizokarpaso]]/Dipkarpaz, in Northern [[Cyprus]], is the ''[[de jure]]'' easternmost point. Although the whole of Cyprus acceded to the European Union on 1 May 2004, EU legislation only applies to the southern part of the island which remained under the effective control of the [[Republic of Cyprus]] after the [[Turkish invasion of Cyprus|Turkish invasion of 1974]]. EU legislation is suspended in [[Northern Cyprus]]. It is therefore ''[[de facto]]'' not part of the EU, making [[Cape Greco]], [[Ayia Napa]] the ''de facto'' easternmost point.  Cyprus is usually considered to be in [[Asia]] rather than [[Europe]] with respect to physical geography, although it is considered culturally European. See also [[European_Union_Enlargement#Northern_Cyprus]] and [[Extreme points of Cyprus]].&lt;/ref&gt; (34° 36’ E)

'''Fennoscandia''' ({{lang-fi|Fennoskandia}}; {{lang-sv|Fennoskandien}}; {{lang-no|Fennoskandia}}; {{lang-ru|Фенноскандия Fennoskandiya}}) or the '''Fennoscandian Peninsula''' is the geographical [[peninsula]] comprising the [[Scandinavian Peninsula]], [[Finland]], [[Karelia]], and the [[Kola Peninsula]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Oxford Handbook of the Archaeology and Anthropology of Hunter-Gatherers'', eds.

'''Geography of Asia''' reviews geographical concepts of classifying [[Asia]], the central and eastern part of [[Eurasia]], comprising approximately fifty countries.

==Geographical characteristics==

===Boundary===
{{main|Asia#Definition and boundaries|l1=Definition and boundaries of Asia}}

The land mass of Asia is not the sum of the land masses of each of its regions, which have been defined independently of the whole. For example, the borders of [[Central Asia]] and the [[Middle East]] depend on who is defining them and for what purpose. These varying definitions are not generally reflected in the map of Asia as a whole; for example, [[Egypt]] is typically included in the Middle East, but not in Asia, even though the Middle East is a division of Asia.

The demarcation between Asia and [[Africa]] is the [[isthmus]] of [[Suez Canal|Suez]] and the [[Red Sea]].
The border with Europe starts with the coast of the eastern Mediterranean, even though Turkey in the [[Near East]] extends partly into the [[Aegean Islands]] and includes [[Istanbul]] on the European side of the [[Bosphorus]]. On the north the boundary between the continents of Asia and [[Europe]] is commonly regarded as running through the [[Dardanelles]], the [[Sea of Marmara]], the [[Bosporus]], the [[Black Sea]], the [[Caucasus Mountains]], the [[Caspian Sea]], the [[Ural River]] to its source, and a long border generally following the eastern side of the [[Ural Mountains]] to the [[Kara Sea]], [[Russia]]. The [[Arctic Ocean]] is the northern border. The [[Bering Straits]] divide Asia from North America.

On the southeast of Asia are the [[Malay Peninsula]] (the limit of mainland Asia) and [[Indonesia]] ("Isles of India", the former East Indies), a vast nation among thousands of islands on the [[Sunda Shelf]], large and small, inhabited and uninhabited. [[Australia]] nearby is a different continent. The Pacific islands northeast of Australia more remotely removed from [[Japan]] and [[Korea]] are [[Oceania]] rather than Asia. From Indonesia the border runs along the [[Indian Ocean]] to the Red Sea. Most of the islands in the Indian Ocean are Asian.

===Overall dimensions===
Different sources give different estimates of the area enclosed by the imaginary border of Asia. The [[New York Times]] ''Atlas of the World'' gives {{convert|43608000|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=The New York Times and Bartholomew, Edinburgh | title=The New York Times Atlas of the World | year=1992 | location=New York | publisher=Times Books (Random House) | page=44}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Chambers World Gazetteer'' rounds off to {{convert|44000000|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}},&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | title=Asia | encyclopedia=Chambers World Gazetteer | year=1988 |edition=5th}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the ''Concise Columbia Encyclopedia'' gives {{convert|44390000|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | title=Asia | encyclopedia=The Concise Columbia Encyclopedia | year=1989 | edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2011 Pearson's has {{convert|44030000|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Edgar Thorpe |author2=Shawick Thorpe | title=The Pearson General Knowledge Manual | year=2011 | location=India | publisher=Dorling Kindersley | page=A.25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The methods of obtaining these figures and exactly what areas they include have not been divulged.

The map surface of mainland Asia is entirely contained within a [[World Geodetic System|Geodetic quadrangle]] formed from segments of [[latitude]] going through its north and south extremes and segments of [[longitude]] passing through the east and west extremes. [[Cape Chelyuskin]] is at 77° 43′ N; [[Tanjung Piai|Cape Piai]] in the [[Malay Peninsula]] is at 1° 16′ N; [[Cape Baba]] in [[Turkey]] is at 26° 4′ E; [[Cape Dezhnyov]] is at 169° 40′ W; that is, mainland Asia ranges through about 77° of latitude and 195° of longitude,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | title=Asia: The Land | encyclopedia=The New Encyclopædia Britannica | edition=15th}}&lt;/ref&gt; distances of about {{convert|8560|km|mi|abbr=on}} long by {{convert|9600|km|mi|abbr=on}} wide according to Chambers, or {{convert|8700|km|mi|abbr=on}} long by {{convert|9700|km|mi|abbr=on}} wide according to Pearson's.

[[Indonesia]] to the southeast, a nation consisting of thousands of islands, adds a significant amount of territory to mainland Asia and extends the extreme Asian latitude further south. The geographic nature of the country raises such questions as whether the sea and the seabed count as Asia. The [[Australia–Indonesia border]] is still being negotiated. Currently a 1997 treaty remains unratified. As there are questions of fishing rights in the waters and mineral rights in the seabed, two different boundaries are being negotiated, one for the water column and one for the seabed. The southernmost seabed boundary is 10° 50' S, the latitude of Point A3, the Australia, Indonesia and Papua lokesh New Guinea common tripoint. The southernmost water column boundary is still further south at Point Z88, 13° 56' 31.8".

==Views of Asia==

===The geographical or traditional view===
Medieval Europeans considered Asia as a [[continent]], a distinct landmass. The European concept of the three continents in the [[Old World]] goes back to [[classical antiquity]]. Definition of continents has long been and remains primarily the realm of [[geography|geographers]], including cultural geographers as well as physical geographers.  A wide majority of geographers, via nearly all atlases and many other publications from the [[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]] to the [[CIA World Factbook]] and [[Merriam-Webster's Geographical Dictionary]] define Europe, Asia and Africa as continents.

====The Hellenic origin====
[[File:Ixia beach Rhodos Greece 4.jpg|thumb|200px|left|The coast of Turkey, original Asian shore seen from a beach on [[Rhodes]].]]
The three-continent system was an idea devised in [[Archaic Greece]], a time of Greek colonial expansion and trade throughout the Mediterranean and the spread of writing again. Writing is a prerequisite of written geography. It had been lost during the preceding [[Greek Dark Ages]], a period of piracy at sea and defensive parochialism on land. The preceding [[Mycenaean Greece]] left scant record of some serving women from a locality in the later [[Asia Minor]] called Asia. Europe was mainly Greece, while Libya was a small region to the west of Egypt. There was no systematic definition of "continent;" however, the Greek mariners did make a distinction that was to become one: the islands, nēsoi, versus the mainland, ēpeiros.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | title=ēpeiros | encyclopedia=A Homeric Dictionary for Schools and Colleges | author=Georg Autenrieth | year=1876}}&lt;/ref&gt; One [[etymology]] relates ēpeir- to the same [[Indo-European language|Indo-European]] root from which English "over" came.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | title=ēpeiros | encyclopedia=Etymologisches Wörterbuch des Griechischen | author=J.B. Hofmann | language=German | year=1950 | location=München | publisher=Verlag von R. Oldenbourg}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Armenian form means "bank, coast." The Greek form must be some sort of "overland," whether continuous land or a coast that looms over. In Latin it became continens terra, "the continuous land," shortened to just continens, stem continent-.

Most ships of the Archaic Period were not ocean-going. They followed the shores closely, ready to put in at the first sign of trouble. It is not surprising that the first continents were "shores," as they are in [[Herodotus]], first historian whose works are extant, who relies on earlier geography now missing except for fragments. Asia is defined by two akrai, "bluffs" or "shores." One runs from [[Phasis (town)|Phasis]] in [[Colchis]] ([[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]) at the eastern end of the [[Black Sea]] around the coast of [[Asia Minor]] to [[Phoenicia]]. The second runs from Phoenicia to the [[Red Sea]] (the ancient Red Sea comprised also the [[Persian Gulf]] and the [[Indian Ocean]]) and from there to India, after which "no man can say what sort of region it is."&lt;ref&gt;''Histories'', Book IV, Articles 37-40.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Museum für Antike Schiffahrt, Mainz 02. Spritsail.jpg|thumb|200px|Ancient ships in trouble on the sea.]]
Asia is equal to its shores, which also define Europe and Libya. The northern shore runs eastward along the line if the Phasis and [[Araxes River]]s; that is, south of the [[Caucasus Mountains]], and around the south of the [[Caspian Sea]]. The southern shore continues the Red Sea and the Nile River, as [[Darius the Great|Darius]] had constructed a canal between them. This division and system was already in place before Herodotus. He professes not to understand it: "I am astonished that men should ever have divided Libya, Asia and Europe as they have, for they are exceedingly unequal."&lt;ref&gt;''Histories'', Book IV, Article 42.&lt;/ref&gt; His astonishment continues: "I cannot conceive why three names, and women's names especially, should ever have been given to a tract which is in reality one ... nor can I even say who gives the three tracts [akrai] their names." Previously he had spoken of two tracts. He says that an alternate northern border is the mouth of the [[Don River (Russia)|Don River]].&lt;ref&gt;''Histories'', Book !V, Article 45&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Strabo]], geographer of the Early Roman Empire, has an explanation of the geography Herodotus found so puzzling. The key is the coast-hugging requirement of most ancient navigation. As the ancient navigator passed under the [[Rock of Gibraltar]] on his way into the [[Mediterranean Sea]] ("our sea" to those who lived there), two paths appeared to him, the north shore or the south shore. Strabo says:&lt;ref&gt;''Geography'', 2.5.26.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"Now as you sail into the strait at the [[Pillars of Hercules|Pillars]], Libya lies on your right hand as far as the stream of the [[Nile River|Nile]], and on your left hand across the strait lies Europe as far as the [[Don River (Russia)|Tanais]]."&lt;/blockquote&gt;
To the ancient navigators of Our Sea, the continents were separated by seas. The canal extended the southern shore into the [[Red Sea]]. The symmetry of the scheme was too geometric for the Greeks to resist, as they represented all geographic masses by regular figures if they could. A triangle prevailed in the Greek imagination with points at the Pillars, the Tanais and the Red Sea. As the sides were three shores, the continents were three.
{{details|topic= the etymology of Asia|Name of Asia}}

====Imperial Roman geography====
The geographer, [[Claudius Ptolemaeus]], distinguishes between geography, which is "a representation in picture of the whole known world," and chorography ("study of places"), which "treats more fully the particulars."&lt;ref&gt;''Geography'', Book I, Chapter 1.&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of the continents is geography and is presented as such. A chorographer in Ptolemy's view was the expert in a specific locality, such as a ship captain, a merchant, or a native. Geographers consult them but they do not write geography unless they happen to be both.

Ptolemy was a geographer of the middle Roman Empire, an Egyptian. The idea of the continents preceded the imperial Romans but through them reached to modern time to determine today's geographic views, which are enhancements and refinements of the classical. Stating that "continents are bounded more properly, when it is possible, by seas than by rivers," Ptolemy defines a three-continent system: Europe, Libya, Asia. His Libya is the North Africa of today, containing a province, Africa, whose name replaced Libya. Rejecting the [[Nile River]] as the Asian border so as not to split [[Egypt]], Ptolemy designates the [[Red Sea]] as the border between Libya and Asia. In the north the border between Asia and Europe is a meridian through the mouth of the [[Don River (Russia)|Don River]] northward "to the unknown region."&lt;ref&gt;''Geography'', Book II, Prologue.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Asia Minor]] remains "Asia properly so called."&lt;ref&gt;''Geography'', Book V, Chapter 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ptolemy's Asia extends to the [[Far East]], approximately identical to today's Asia, except that the European border runs through the future location of [[Moscow]], then a wilderness of forest skirted by [[Sarmatia]]n tribesmen. In a striking foreshadowing of European and Asian Russia, European Sarmatia lies between the [[Vistula River]] and the [[Don River (Russia)|Don River]], while Asian Sarmatia runs east of the Don to [[Scythia]].&lt;ref&gt;''Geography'', Book V, Chapter 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Geologic view===
{{see also|North Asia#Geomorphology|Geology of India}}
The relatively recent study of [[plate tectonics]] has discovered that Asia has several regions that would be considered distinct landmasses if strictly geologic and tectonic criteria were used (for example, South Asia and East Asia). Definition of ''[[continental plates]]'' is the realm of [[geology|geologists]]. Strictly in terms of geological landmasses or tectonic plates, Europe is a western peninsula of [[Eurasia]] and of the Africa-Eurasia landmass. In the latter, Europe and Asia are parts of the Eurasian plate, which excludes the Arabian and Indian tectonic plates.

===Regional view===
In human geography, there are several schools of thought. The more common school follows historical convention and treats Europe and Asia as different continents, categorizing  East Asia, South Asia, and the Middle East as specific regions for more detailed analysis. Other schools equate the word "continent" to geographical "region" when referring to Europe and Asia in terms of physical geography. {{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

===Ethnic view===
In European languages the term "Asian" more commonly refers to ethnic heritage rather than a strict geographic area. In American English, "Asian" often refers to [[Orientalism|East Asians]], while in British English, Asian often refers to South Asians. See the [[List of transcontinental countries]] for further geographic definitions. The term [[Asia Pacific]] generally refers to a combination of [[East Asia]], [[Southeast Asia]], and islands in the [[Pacific Ocean]] &amp;mdash; and most are also considered part of [[Australasia]] or [[Oceania]]. Asia contains the [[Indian subcontinent]], [[Arabian peninsula]], as well as a piece of the North American plate in Siberia.

== Regions ==
Since the 18th century [[Asia]] has been divided into several subregions independently defined from Asia as a whole. There have been no historical consensus and there is not now any universal consensus on the use of these terms, just as there is none for the word "Asia".

The regions of Asia include:
; [[Central Asia]]
: Commonly understood as comprising [[Kazakhstan]], [[Uzbekistan]], [[Tajikistan]], [[Turkmenistan]], [[Kyrgyzstan]].
; [[East Asia]]
: Commonly understood as comprising&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/wfbExt/region_eas.html|title=East Asia|accessdate=6 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[China]], [[Hong Kong]], [[Macau]], [[North Korea]], [[South Korea]], [[Japan]], [[Taiwan]], [[Mongolia]].
; [[South Asia]] 
: Commonly understood as comprising&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/wfbExt/region_sas.html|title=South Asia|accessdate=6 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Afghanistan]], [[Pakistan]], [[India]], [[Maldives]], [[Sri Lanka]], [[Nepal]], [[Bhutan]], [[Bangladesh]]. A common approximate synonym for South Asia is the [[Indian subcontinent]], plus Afghanistan.
; [[Southeast Asia]]
: Commonly understood as comprising&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/wfbExt/region_eas.html|title=Southeast Asia|accessdate=6 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Brunei]], [[Cambodia]], [[Indonesia]], [[Laos]], [[Malaysia]], [[Myanmar]], [[Philippines|The Philippines]], [[Singapore]], [[Thailand]], [[Timor-Leste]], [[Vietnam]].
; [[Western Asia]] (or [[Western Asia|Southwestern Asia]], or [[Middle East]] minus [[Egypt]])
: Commonly understood as comprising&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/wfbExt/region_mde.html|title=West Asia/Middle East|accessdate=6 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Armenia]], [[Azerbaijan]], [[Bahrain]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Iran]], [[Iraq]], [[Israel]], [[Jordan]], [[Kuwait]], [[Lebanon]], the [[Gaza Strip]], [[Oman]], [[Qatar]], [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Syria]], [[Turkey]], [[United Arab Emirates]], [[Yemen]].
; [[North Asia]]
: Commonly understood as comprising eastern [[Russia]].

==Asia's changing climate==

A survey carried out in 2010 by global risk analysis firm [[Maplecroft]] identified 16 countries that are extremely vulnerable to [[climate change]]. Each nation's vulnerability was calculated using 42 socio, economic and environmental indicators, which identified the likely climate change impacts during the next 30 years. The Asian countries of [[Bangladesh]], [[India]], [[Vietnam]], [[Thailand]], [[Pakistan]] and [[Sri Lanka]] were among the 16 countries facing extreme risk from climate change. Some shifts are already occurring. For example, in tropical parts of India with a [[semi-arid climate]], the temperature increased by 0.4&amp;nbsp;°C between 1901 and 2003.
A 2013 study by the [[International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics]] ([[ICRISAT]]) aimed to find science-based, pro-poor approaches and techniques that would enable Asia's agricultural systems to cope with climate change, while benefitting poor and vulnerable farmers. The study's recommendations ranged from improving the use of climate information in local planning and strengthening weather-based agro-advisory services, to stimulating diversification of rural household incomes and providing incentives to farmers to adopt natural resource conservation measures to enhance forest cover, replenish [[groundwater]] and use [[renewable energy]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://exploreit.icrisat.org/sites/default/files/uploads/1378286859_PolicyBrief23.pdf ''Vulnerability to Climate Change: Adaptation Strategies and layers of Resilience''], [[ICRISAT]], Policy Brief No. 23, February 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

==General data for countries defined as Asian by the UNSD==
The [[United Nations Statistics Division]], charged with collecting statistical data on global regions including Asia, publishes a classification standard, [[UN M.49|United Nations M49]], which assigns code numbers to continental regions, areas and countries, based on statistical purposes,&lt;ref name="millenniumindicators.un.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://millenniumindicators.un.org/unsd/methods/m49/m49regin.htm|title=United Nations Statistics Division- Standard Country and Area Codes Classifications (M49)|publisher=[[United Nations Statistics Division]]|accessdate=2010-07-24|date=31 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the countries and regions grouped together don't imply any assumption regarding political or other affiliations between the grouped countries.&lt;ref name="millenniumindicators.un.org"/&gt; Some general data on the countries listed in M49 for the continental region, Asia (142), and one non-official region, "Northern Asia," are presented below.

M49 is a device for collecting useful statistics for the UNSD and is a suggested reference guide offered as a global standard for all agencies and institutions within the various UN departments that might be interested. The United Nations Statistics Division does not present it as an authoritative standard or as one that is more valid or more worthy of adoption than some other. It is not a requirement for other agencies within the United Nations, which use their own standards as are convenient for their operations.

No nations have adopted M49 as a mandatory standard. It does, however, reflect general usage concerning the political geography of Asia. M49 is updated frequently to reflect changing geopolitical circumstances.

One problematic aspect of the classification of Asia not yet definitively addressed by the Statistics Division is "Northern Asia," which has no regional code and is not currently officially a [[United Nations geoscheme for Asia|region of Asia]]. Russia, or "the Russian Federation," is a nation of Europe. The "Northern Asia" name is unofficially recognized; for example, the UN Group of Experts on Geographical Names includes an Eastern Europe, Northern and Central Asia Division. "Northern Asia"  comes from traditional usage, which divides Europe from Asia at the Ural Mountains. No one at the UN is suggesting that European Russia be included in Asia or that Asian Russia be included in Europe. Their policy is that a nation shall appear once in one region. They have selected Europe. The problem remains unsolved.

===Geopolitical map of Asia===
The nations of this map with one major exception (and a few minor ones) are those defined by the [[World Factbook]]. Short forms of the names are used; sometimes abbreviations. All the nations can be found in the table below. The one major exception to the scheme is "Russia," not currently officially in the continental region of Asia, but unofficially [[North Asia|partly in it]] even though classified as Europe.

===Geopolitical data for Asia===

====Introduction====
The countries in this table are categorised mainly, but not entirely, according to the [[UN geoscheme|UNSD scheme for statistical purposes]] used by the [[United Nations Statistics Division]]. For example, the UNSD statistical geoscheme does not recognize a "North Asia," but problematic differences in point of view reach down to the country level elsewhere as well. Part of [[Egypt]] ([[Sinai Peninsula]]) is geographically in Western Asia, and the [[States and territories of Australia|Australian external territories]] of [[Christmas Island]] and the [[Cocos (Keeling) Islands]] are often associated with Asia. However, these are not present in the UNSD geoscheme.

There is no universally defined standard Asia. Traditional views are approximate at best. Even today borders are still being defined, as between Indonesia, Australia and Oceania. As long as conflict over territory remains a human trait there may well be "an eastern question," as the British Empire said of the Ottoman Empire.

In evaluating the geographic position of nations of the edge of Asia some writers utilize the amorphous concept of "[[transcontinental countries]],"  which has different meanings to different authorities. Merriam-Webster defines it as "going across a continent," as might a railroad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=transcontinental | work=Merriam-Webster Dictionary | url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/transcontinental | publisher=m-w.com, Encyclopædia Britannica | accessdate=22 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; With regard to Asia, there is only one such country, the Russian Federation.

In a second definition, Petrovsky refers to a new tendency to form transcontinental agencies, meaning agencies whose jurisdictions cross continental borders, rather than the whole continent.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | first=Vladimir | last=Petrovsky | editor-first=Najeeb | editor-last=Al-Nauimi | editor2-first=Richard | editor2-last=Meese | contribution=Preventative &amp; Peace-Making Diplomacy &amp; the Role of International Law in Conflict Resolution | title=International Legal Issues Arising Under the United Nations Decade of International Law | series=Proceedings of the Qatar International Law Conference '94 | location=The Hague, London, Boston | publisher=Martinus Nijhoff Publishers (Kluwer) | year=1995 | page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Petrovsky's examples put together widely scattered sections of continents. There is no question of their trans- status. More precise views, however, require definitions of continents, which in the case of Asia are not quite so facile.

A third definition emphasizes transformation in place from one continent to another. Fahey at first defines Turkey as transcontinental by virtue of being in both [[Anatolia]] and the Balkans, neglecting the historical circumstance that the Balkans as part of the Ottoman Empire were once Asian, as was much of North Africa. He then hypothesizes that Turkey, accepted into the [[European Union]], is defined by that circumstance to be European.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Tony | last=Fahey | editor-last=Immerfall | editor-first=Stefan | editor2-last=Göran | editor2-first=Therborn | year=2009 | title=Handbook of European Societies: Social Transformations in the 21st Century | contribution=Population | location=New York | publisher=Springer | page=417}}&lt;/ref&gt; By this usage, the very region to which "Asia" was first applied is now Europe. If it is, Turkey cannot be transcontinental by being split between two continents. This sort of paradox only underlines that Asia has no precise definition in the same way that nations do, to whom a mere 100 yards of border may be of great concern.

Data included in the table below are per sources in linked articles when available, the CIA World Factbook when not. No attempt is made to split populations. That of Russia is for the whole country; thus, the populations and areas cannot be summed to produce those of any defined Asia. The notes state which nations might be considered transcontinental by some agency, but there is little agreement generally.

[[File:Indochina map 1886.jpg|thumb|1886 map of Indochina, from the [[Scottish Geographical Magazine]]]]

'''Indochina''', originally '''Indo-China''', is a geographical term originating in the early nineteenth century and referring to the continental portion of the region now known as [[Southeast Asia]]. The name refers to the lands historically within the cultural influence of [[India]] and [[China]], and physically bound by the [[Indian Subcontinent]] in the west and China in the north. It corresponds to the present-day areas of [[Myanmar]], [[Thailand]], [[Laos]], [[Cambodia]], [[Vietnam]], and (variably) [[peninsular Malaysia]] and [[Singapore]]. The term was later adopted as the name of the colony of [[French Indochina]] (today's Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos), and the entire area of Indochina is now usually referred to as the Indochinese Peninsula or [[Mainland Southeast Asia]].

==History==
The origins of the name Indo-China are usually attributed jointly to the Danish-French geographer [[Conrad Malte-Brun]], who referred to the area as {{lang|fr|indo-chinois}} in 1804, and the Scottish linguist [[John Leyden]], who used the term ''Indo-Chinese'' to describe the area's inhabitants and their languages in 1808.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editors=Vimalin Rujivacharakul et al. |title=Architecturalized Asia : mapping a continent through history |date=2013 |publisher=Hong Kong University Press |isbn=9789888208050 |page=89 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Scholarly opinions at the time regarding China's and India's historical influence over the area were conflicting, and the term was itself controversial—Malte-Brun himself later argued against its use in a later edition of his ''Universal Geography'', reasoning that it over-emphasized Chinese influence, and suggested ''Chin-India'' instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Malte-Brun |first1=Conrad |title=Universal Geography, Or, A Description of All the Parts of the World, on a New Plan, According to the Great Natural Divisions of the Globe: Improved by the Addition of the Most Recent Information, Derived from Various Sources : Accompanied with Analytical, Synoptical, and Elementary Tables, Volume 2 |date=1827 |publisher=A. Finley |pages=262–3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, ''Indo-China'' had already gained traction and soon supplanted alternative terms such as ''[[Further India]]'' and the ''Peninsula beyond the Ganges''. Later, however, as the French established the colony of [[French Indochina]], use of the term became more restricted to the French colony,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Wesseling |first1=H. L. |title=The European Colonial Empires: 1815–1919 |date=2015 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=9781317895060 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and today the area is usually referred to as Mainland Southeast Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Keyes |first1=Charles F. |title=The golden peninsula : culture and adaptation in mainland Southeast Asia |date=1995 |publisher=University of Hawaii Press |isbn=9780824816964 |edition=Pbk. reprint |page=1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In biogeography==
In [[biogeography]], the Indochinese Region is a major [[biogeography|biogeographical]] region in the [[Indomalaya ecozone]], and also a [[phytogeography|phytogeographical]] [[floristic region]] in the [[Paleotropical Kingdom]]. It includes the native flora and fauna of all the countries above. The adjacent [[Malesia|Malesian Region]] covers the [[Maritime Southeast Asia]]n countries, and straddles the Indomalaya and [[Australasian ecozone]]s.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4001">[[Emeritus]] Professor '''John Adams''' (born 1938) of [[University College London]], is a professor of [[geography]] and leading theorist on [[risk compensation]].  His book ''Risk'' is an analysis of how humans assess and respond to perceived [[risk]]s.

==Areas of interest==

===Risk compensation===
Adams is known for a theory of risk compensation, that states that a 'risk thermostat' guides much human behavior. Humans experiencing a 'safe' lifestyle seek out risky activities; but when doing them, overcompensate before returning to safety. This behaviour operates like a thermostat, regulating human behavior. He argues that because of the thermostat effect, banning risky activity will not work completely, and risk -seeking accompanies many aspects of everyday life. He spoke on this at the ''Shared Space'' conference held in [[Ipswich]] in June, 2005, where in his talk titled "Risk Compensation versus the obedient automaton theory of human behaviour" he discussed how understanding risk compensation was essential to the understanding of why [[shared space]] principles work for the design of public spaces such as road layouts in towns.&lt;ref name="SharedSpace"&gt;{{cite web

 |archivedate=2007-09-28 
 |df= 
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hypermobility===
He has also coined the term and written extensively on the phenomenon of [[hypermobility (travel)|hypermobility]], particular the misplaced belief that new road building solves traffic problems, rather than worsening them. 

===Climate change===
Adams has not always voiced mainstream views on climate change. He has been critical of the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] (IPCC) and has praised "reputable scientists who react sceptically to the “[[Hockey stick controversy|hockey stick]]” peddled by [[John T. Houghton|Sir John Houghton]] and the IPCC."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=johnadams |url=http://john-adams.co.uk/2010/06/09/not-published-in-new-scientist/ |title=Letter not published in New Scientist |publisher=John Adams |date=2010-05-14 |accessdate=2013-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other===
Adams was a member of the advisory committee to the [[Anti-Concorde Project]]. When working in central London he was a daily cyclist, occasionally writing on cycling issues.

Wolpert's earliest research focused on testing social and economic theory based upon spatial data,  productivity gaps elated to environmental risk and imperfect information, the migration decision, the relation between commuting and migration, siting and closing amenity and "nimby" facilities, and disaster evacuation, and the effects of sprawl on regional development. More recently, his studies concerned the nonprofit marketplace in cities, nonprofit service representation and saturation of neighborhoods, locational variations in generosity, distributional effects of foundations, the fiscal viability of nonprofits, and methods for planning and evaluating nonprofit organizations and foundations.

[[File:Villa Vizcaya - IMG 8057.JPG|thumb|'Water stair' fountain in the garden at [[Villa Vizcaya]]]]
Landscape design focuses on both the integrated master [[landscape planning]] of a property and the specific [[garden design]] of landscape elements and [[plant]]s within it. The practical, [[Design|aesthetic]], [[Horticulture|horticultural]], and environmental sustainability are also components of landscape design, which is often divided into hardscape design and softscape design. Landscape designers often collaborate with related disciplines such as [[architecture]] and [[geography]], soils and [[civil engineering]], [[surveying]], [[Landscaping|landscape contracting]], [[botany]], and artisan specialties.

Design projects may involve two different professional roles: landscape design and landscape architecture.
* '''Landscape design''' typically involves artistic composition and artisanship, horticultural finesse and expertise, and emphasis on detailed site involvement from conceptual stages through to final construction.
* '''[[Landscape architecture]]''' focuses more on urban planning, city and regional parks, civic and corporate landscapes, large scale interdisciplinary projects, and delegation to contractors after completing designs. 
There can be significant overlap of talent and skill between the two roles, depending on the education, licensing, and experience of the professional. Both landscape designers and landscape architects practice landscape design.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.asla.org/nonmembers/publicrelations/qanda.htm|title=ASLA: Question &amp; Answer|website=www.asla.org|access-date=2016-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design approach==

Design factors include objective qualities such as: climate and microclimates; topography and orientation, site drainage and groundwater recharge; municipal and resource building codes; soils and irrigation; human and vehicular access and circulation; recreational amenities (i.e.: sports and water); furnishings and lighting; [[native plant]] habitat botany when present; property safety and security; [[landscape detailing|construction detailing]]; and other measurable considerations.[[File:View of the sunken gardens at Butchart Gardens.jpg|thumb|left|View of the sunken gardens at Butchart Gardens]]

Design factors also include subjective qualities such as: [[genius loci]] (the special site qualities to emphasize); client's needs and preferences; desirable plants and elements to retain on site, modify, or replace, and that may be available for [[borrowing of scenery ("shakkei")]] from beyond; artistic composition from  perspectives of both looking upon and observing from within; spatial development and definition—using lines, sense of scale, and balance and symmetry; plant palettes; and artistic [[wiktionary:Focal point|focal point]]s for enjoyment. There are innumerable other design factors and considerations brought to the complex process of designing a garden that is beautiful, well-functioning, and that thrives over time.

The up-and-coming practice of online landscape design allows professional landscapers to remotely design and plan sites through manipulation of two-dimensional images without ever physically visiting the location.  Due to the frequent lack of non-visual, supplementary data such as soil assessments and pH tests, online landscaping necessarily must focus on incorporating only plants which are tolerant across many diverse soil conditions.

==Training==

Historically, landscape designers trained by apprenticing—such as [[André Le Nôtre]], who apprenticed with his father before designing the [[Gardens of Versailles]]—to accomplished masters in the field, with the titular name varying and reputation paramount for a career. The professional section of garden designers in Europe and the Americas went by the name 'Landscape Gardener.' In the 1890s, the distinct classification of [[landscape architect]] was created, with educational and licensing test requirements for using the title legally. [[Beatrix Farrand]], the sole woman in the founding group, refused the title preferring Landscape Gardener. Matching the client and technical needs of a project, and the appropriate practitioner with talent, legal qualifications, and experienced skills, surmounts title nomenclature.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

Institutional education in landscape design appeared in the early 20th century. Over time it became available at various levels. Ornamental horticulture programs with design components are offered at community college and universities within [[Agricultural education|schools of agriculture]] or horticulture, with some beginning to offer garden or landscape design certificates and degrees. Departments of landscape architecture are located within university schools of architecture or [[environmental design]], with undergraduate and graduate degrees offered. Specialties and minors are available in [[horticultural botany]], [[horticulture]], [[Natural resource management|natural resources]], [[landscape engineering]], [[construction management]],  [[Fine art|fine]] and [[applied art]]s, and [[:Category:Landscape design history|landscape design history]]. Traditionally, hand drawn drawings documented the design and  position of features for construction, but [[Landscape design software]] is frequently used now.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

Other routes of training are through informal apprenticeships with practicing landscape designers, landscape architects, landscape contractors, gardeners, nurseries and garden centers, and docent programs at botanical and public gardens.  Since the landscape designer title does not have college degree or licensing requirements to be used, there is a very wide range of sophistication, aesthetic talent, technical expertise, and specialty strengths to be responsibly matched with specific client and project requirements.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

==Gardening==

Many landscape designers have an interest and involvement with [[gardening]], personally or professionally. Gardens are dynamic and not static after construction and planting are completed, and so in some ways are 'never done.' Involvement with [[landscape manager|landscape management]] and direction of ongoing garden direction, evolution, and care depend on the professional's and client's needs and inclinations. As with the other interrelated landscape disciplines, there can be overlap of services offered under the titles of landscape designer or professional gardener.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.asla.org/nonmembers/publicrelations/qanda.htm|title=ASLA: Question &amp; Answer|website=www.asla.org|access-date=2016-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is a '''list of [[Arab League]] countries by [[gross domestic product]] at [[Real versus nominal value (economics)|nominal values]]'''. Gross domestic product is the value of all final goods and services produced within a nation in a given year.

The table below shows the nominal GDP and GDP [[per capita]] data for the 22 members of the Arab League. Most figures are from the [[International Monetary Fund]] based on statistics from 2017, and are shown in current [[United States dollar|US dollars]]. Figures from other sources are referenced and noted as such. The GDP figure for Syria is from 2014, and its GDP per capita figure is from 2016. Figures for Palestine and Somalia are from 2016.

Countries (or territories) outside the Arab League with roughly equivalent GDP and GDP per capita figures are shown alongside Arab League figures for comparison.

==K==

The DST column shows the months in which Daylight Saving Time, a.k.a. Summer Time, begins and ends. A blank DST box usually indicates that the location stays on Standard Time all year, although in some cases the location stays on Summer Time all year. If a location is currently on DST, add one hour to the time in the Time column.

&lt;!--
Informations about Kanainj Airport and Kopiago Airport are found a little,
some web site is saying that Kanainj Airport=ICAO:AYKJ/IATA:KNE and Kopiago Airport=ICAO:AYKG/IATA:KPA.
It is likely that at least ICAO code of Kanainj is not AYKG,
and for now, the problem is duplication of ICAO code in wikipedia pages,
so I temporalily modified ICAO code of Kanaiji from AYKG to AYKJ.
Please make sure by more authorised resources like AIP, etc.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2740">'''Postal codes in Peru''' were updated in February 2011 to employ a five-digit format.   

The first three digits of the postal code identify the postal zone, which corresponds to a province. For instance, postal zone 010 corresponds to the Chachapoyas province. The remaining two digits identify a geographical part of the province. There is no relation between the last two digits and administrative boundaries.

==Principal ring roads==
The city of Cologne possesses one of the most comprehensive urban [[ring road]] systems. The beltways were laid out during the end of the 19th and the early 20th century and today are still being complemented and extended. Their development originated in the work of architects and urban designers such as [[Karl Henrici]], [[Josef Stübben]] and [[Fritz Schumacher (architect)|Fritz Schumacher]] as well as former Cologne mayors [[Hermann Heinrich Becker]] and [[Konrad Adenauer]].

===Cologne Ring===
[[File:Hohenzollernring-Köln-027-2.JPG|thumb|upright|Hohenzollernring on the [[Cologne Ring]]]]
The '''[[Cologne Ring]]''' ({{lang-de|Kölner Ring}} or plural {{lang|de|Kölner Ringe}}) is a semi-circular, some 6&amp;nbsp;km long [[urban boulevard]] in [[Innenstadt, Cologne]] and the city's busiest and most prominent street system. The Cologne Ring is a four-lane street and part of [[Bundesstraße]] 9.

The ring sections between Barbarossaplatz and Ebertplatz are some of the busiest streets in Cologne.

===Innere Kanalstraße===
'''Innere Kanalstraße''' is part of a ring road system, which spans from Vorgebirgstraße in the south-west to [[Zoobrücke]] in the north-east. Innere Kanalstraße and '''Universitätsstraße''' are the longest of these streets and follow the outside outline of the [[Cologne Green Belt]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cologne-tourism.com/attractions-culture/parks-gardens/koelner-gruenguertel-green-belt.html cologne-tourism.com/green-belt]&lt;/ref&gt; (German: ''Kölner Grüngürtel''). They therefore encircle the district of Innenstadt to the west and north-west. These are mostly six-lane roads and follow the Inner Ring almost [[concentric]]ally. Kanal- and Universitätsstraße are a major relief of traffic load on the Inner Ring. Landmarks on Universitätsstraße are the [[University of Cologne|University]], after which the street is named, and the Aachener Weiher with the [[Museum of East Asian Art, Cologne|Museum of East Asian Art]]. Landmarks on Innere Kanalstraße are the [[Colonius]] telecommunication tower and the Herkules tower.

===Cologne Belt===
[[File:Köln- Station- Sülzgürtel-008.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Sülz]]gürtel on the [[Cologne Belt]]]]
The '''[[Cologne Belt]]''' (German: ''Kölner Gürtel'') is a system of ring roads which runs through the Left-Rhenish [[districts of Cologne]]. The sections of the Cologne Belt are mostly defined by the large arterial roads running perpendicular to them and are named after the districts and city parts they pass through. The Cologne Belt was set up in the early 20th century and is somewhat concentric to Kanal- and Universitätsstraße and the Cologne Inner Ring.

===Militärringstraße===
Only a minor street today, the '''[[Militärringstraße]]''' once had significance for the fortifications of Cologne during the 19th and early 20th century. The Militärring once was a true ring, encircling the entire city at a length of some {{convert|40|km|abbr=on}}.

===Cologne Beltway===
[[File:Köln-Lindweiler, A1.jpg|thumb|upright|[[BAB 1]] on the [[Cologne Beltway]]]]
The '''[[Cologne Beltway]]''' (German: ''Kölner Autobahnring'') is the generic term for the [[Autobahn]]s encircling [[Cologne]]. It consists of the [[Bundesautobahn 3]], the [[Bundesautobahn 4]] and the [[Bundesautobahn 1]]. With an average of 160,000 cars per day on the BAB 3 and 100,000 on A4 and A1, the beltway handles one of the highest traffic volumes in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.strassen.nrw.de/_down/pub_cologne_ring_road.pdf Extension of the Cologne Ring Road] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110517004114/http://strassen.nrw.de/_down/pub_cologne_ring_road.pdf |date=2011-05-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The beltway crosses the [[Rhine]] at [[Leverkusen Bridge]] in the north and [[Cologne Rodenkirchen Bridge]] in the south. The Autobahns on the beltway cross [[Bundesautobahn 559]], [[Bundesautobahn 555]] and [[Bundesautobahn 57]]. The [[Bundesautobahn 59]] is tied to the beltway at the interchange Leverkusen-West in the north and to ''Dreieck'' Heumar in the south. [[Cologne/Bonn Airport]] lies on the Bundesautobahn 59.

In the following a list of [[arterial road]]s, starting clockwise in the North-East. The names of some roads indicate the city or direction, they lead towards.

Right-Rhenish arterial roads all start in [[Deutz, Cologne|Deutz]]. Deutz is a city part of [[Innenstadt, Cologne|Innenstadt]]. Left-Rhenish arterial roads mostly start at the Cologne Ring. Of the major arterial roads, only Dürener Straße and the [[BAB 57]] start on Universitätsstraße and Innere Kanalstraße respectively. Konrad-Adenauer-Ufer is a [[Embankment (transportation)|river embankment]] road, leading further into the center up to [[Hohenzollern Bridge]].

The '''local-area augmentation system (LAAS)''' is an all-weather aircraft landing system based on real-time differential correction of the [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] signal. Local reference [[Receiver (radio)|receiver]]s located around the airport send data to a central location at the airport. This data is used to formulate a correction message, which is then transmitted to users via a [[VHF Data Link]]. A receiver on an aircraft uses this information to correct GPS signals, which then provides a standard [[Instrument Landing System|ILS]]-style display to use while flying a [[precision approach]]. The FAA has stopped using the term LAAS and has transitioned to the [[International Civil Aviation Organization]] (ICAO) terminology of [[Ground Based Augmentation System|Ground-Based Augmentation System]] (GBAS).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.faa.gov/about/office_org/headquarters_offices/ato/service_units/techops/navservices/gnss/faq/laas/|title=GNSS Frequently Asked Questions – GBAS|website=www.faa.gov|access-date=2016-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the FAA has indefinitely delayed plans for federal GBAS acquisition, the system can be purchased by airports and installed as a Non-Federal navigation aid.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.faa.gov/about/office_org/headquarters_offices/ato/service_units/techops/navservices/gnss/laas/|title=Satellite Navigation – Ground Based Augmentation System (GBAS)|website=www.faa.gov|access-date=2016-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The ground-based augmentation system (GBAS) with aviation standards identified in International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) Standards and Recommended Practices (SARPS), Annex 10 on radio-frequency navigation provides international standards for augmentation of GPS to support precision landing.  The history of these standards can trace back to efforts in the United States by the Federal Aviation Administration to develop a Local Area Augmentation System (LAAS). Many references still refer to LAAS, although the current international terminology is GBAS and GBAS Landing System (GLS).

GBAS monitors GNSS satellites and provides correction messages to users in the vicinity of the GBAS station. The monitoring enables the GBAS to detect anomalous GPS satellite behavior and alert users in a time frame appropriate for aviation uses. The GBAS provides corrections to the GPS signals with a resulting improvement in accuracy sufficient to support aircraft precision approach operations. For more information on how GBAS works, see GBAS-How It Works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.faa.gov/about/office_org/headquarters_offices/ato/service_units/techops/navservices/gnss/laas/howitworks/|title=Satellite Navigation – GBAS – How It Works|author=|date=|website=www.FAA.gov|access-date=September 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Current GBAS standards only augment a single GNSS frequency and support landings to Category-1 minima. These GBAS systems are identified as GBAS Approach Service Type C (GAST-C).  Draft requirements for a GAST-D system are under review by ICAO.  A GAST-D system will support operations to Category-III minima. Many organizations are conducting research in multi-frequency GBAS. Other efforts are exploring the addition of Galileo corrections for GBAS.

Honeywell has developed a Non-Federal CAT-1 GBAS which received system design approval from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in September 2009 [1]. The GBAS installation at Newark Liberty International Airport achieved Operational Approval on September 28, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.faa.gov/about/office_org/headquarters_offices/ato/service_units/techops/navservices/gnss/mobileAll/GBAS_Newark.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-05-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222223921/http://www.faa.gov/about/office_org/headquarters_offices/ato/service_units/techops/navservices/gnss/mobileAll/GBAS_Newark.pdf |archivedate=February 22, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; A second GBAS installed at Houston Intercontinental Airport received operational approval on April 23, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fly2houston.com/0/3921086/0/83280/|title=- Houston Airport System|author=|date=|website=Fly2Houston.com|access-date=September 7, 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140327221113/http://www.fly2houston.com/0/3921086/0/83280/|archivedate=March 27, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Honeywell systems are also installed internationally, with an operational system in Bremen, Germany.  Additional systems are installed or in the process of being installed.  Operational approval of several more systems is expected shortly.{{When|date=September 2017}}

==Operation==
Local reference receivers are located around an airport at precisely surveyed locations. The signal received from the GPS constellation is used to calculate the position of the LAAS ground station, which is then compared to its precisely surveyed position. This data is used to formulate a correction message which is transmitted to users via a VHF data link. A receiver on the aircraft uses this information to correct the GPS signals it receives. This information is used to create an ILS-type display for aircraft approach and landing purposes.  Honeywell's CAT I system provides precision approach service within a radius of 23 NM surrounding a single airport.  LAAS mitigates GPS threats in the Local Area to a much greater accuracy than WAAS and therefore provides a higher level of service not attainable by WAAS.
LAAS's VHF uplink signal is currently slated to share the frequency band from 108&amp;nbsp;MHz to 118&amp;nbsp;MHz with existing ILS localizer and VOR navigational aids. LAAS utilizes a Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) technology in servicing the entire airport with a single frequency allocation. With future replacement of ILS, LAAS will reduce the congested VHF NAV band.

==Accuracy==
The current Category-1 (GAST-C) GBAS achieves a Category I Precision Approach accuracy of 16 m laterally and 4 m vertically.&lt;ref&gt;RTCA DO-245A Table 2-1&lt;/ref&gt; The goal of a to-be developed GAST-D GBAS is to provide Category III Precision Approach capability. The minimum accuracy for lateral and vertical errors of a Category III system are specified in RTCA DO-245A, ''Minimum Aviation System Performance Standards for Local Area Augmentation System (LAAS)''. The GAST-D GBAS will allow aircraft to land with zero visibility using 'autoland' systems.

==Benefits==
One of the primary benefits of LAAS is that a single installation at a major airport can be used for multiple precision approaches within the local area. For example, if [[O'Hare International Airport|Chicago O'Hare]] has twelve [[runway]] ends, each with a separate ILS, all twelve ILS facilities can be replaced with a single LAAS system. This represents a significant cost savings in maintenance and upkeep of the existing ILS equipment.

Another benefit is the potential for approaches that are not straight- in. Aircraft equipped with LAAS technology can utilize curved or complex approaches such that they could be flown on to avoid obstacles or to decrease noise levels in areas surrounding an airport.  This technology shares similar characteristics with the older [[Microwave landing system]] (MLS) Approaches, commonly seen in Europe.  Both systems allow lower visibility requirements on complex approaches that traditional [[Wide Area Augmentation System|Wide Area Augmentation Systems (WAAS)]] and [[Instrument landing system|Instrument Landing Systems (ILS)]] could not allow.{{Citation needed|date=November 2012}}

The FAA also contends that only a single set of navigational equipment will be needed on an aircraft for both LAAS and [[WAAS]] capability. This lowers initial cost and maintenance per aircraft since only one receiver is required instead of multiple receivers for [[Non-directional beacon|NDB]]'s, [[Distance Measuring Equipment|DME]], [[VHF omnidirectional range|VOR]], [[Instrument Landing System|ILS]], [[Microwave Landing System|MLS]] and [[Global Positioning System|GPS]]. The FAA hopes this will result in decreased cost to the airlines and passengers as well as [[general aviation]].

==Drawbacks==
LAAS shares the drawbacks of all RF based landing systems; those being jamming both intentional or accidental.

==Variations==
The [[Joint Precision Approach and Landing System]] (JPALS) is a similar system for military usage.  [[Honeywell]] has developed the Honeywell International Satellite Landing System (SLS) 4000 series (SLS-4000) which received system design approval from the FAA on September 3, 2009, with a follow-on approval of an enhanced SLS-4000 (SLS-4000 Block 1) in September 2012.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://aerospace.honeywell.com/en/products/navigation-and-sensors/smartpath-ground-based-augmentation-system|title=SmartPath Ground-Based Augmentation System|website=aerospace.honeywell.com|access-date=2016-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Future==
The FAA's [[National Airspace System]] (NAS) enterprise architecture is the blueprint for transforming the current NAS to the [[Next Generation Air Transportation System]] (NextGen). The NAS service roadmaps lay out the strategic activities for service delivery to improve NAS operations and move towards the NextGen vision. They show the evolution of major FAA investments/programs in today's NAS services to meet the future demand. The GBAS precision approaches is one of the investment programs that provide solution to "increase flexibility in the terminal environment" in the NextGen implementation plan.

The FAA expected to replace legacy navigation systems with satellite based navigation technology; however the FAA has indefinitely delayed plans for federal GBAS acquisition, the system can be purchased by airports and installed as a non-federal navigation aid. The FAA continues to develop GBAS systems and seek international standardization.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Mount Karisimbi''' is an [[inactive volcano]] in the [[Virunga Mountains]] on the border between [[Rwanda]] and the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Democratic Republic of Congo]]. At {{convert|4507|m|ft|0}}, Karisimbi is the highest of the eight major mountains of the mountain range, which is a part of [[Albertine Rift]], the western branch of the [[East African Rift]]. Karisimbi is flanked by [[Mount Mikeno|Mikeno]] to the north, [[Mount Bisoke|Bisoke]] to the east and [[Mount Nyiragongo|Nyiragongo]] to the west, on the other side of the Rift Valley. Karisimbi is the [[Highest mountain peaks of Africa|11th highest mountain of Africa]].

The name Karisimbi comes from the word 'amasimbi' in the local language, [[Kinyarwanda]], which means ''snow''. Snow can mostly be found during the dry season in June, July and August on the top of the volcano.

Between Karisimbi and Bisoke is the [[Karisoke]] Research Center, which was founded by [[Dian Fossey]] in order to observe the [[mountain gorilla]]s living in this area.

==1908 expedition==
On February 27, 1908 an expedition led by Egon Von Kirschstein was coming down the Branca Crater when a hailstorm and snowstorm caused twenty of the expedition's porters to perish.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=8m09AAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA416&amp;dq=froze+on+mount+karissimbi&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwAmoVChMI6Y3VwIbUyAIVRPMeCh3alAy5#v=onepage&amp;q=froze%20on%20mount%20karissimbi&amp;f=false Bulletin of the American Geographical Society, Volume 40 .p.416 1908]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Norte Grande Geography Journal''''' or '''''Revista de geografía Norte Grande''''' is an [[academic journal]] published by the [[Pontifical Catholic University of Chile]]. Its scope was initially confined to geography related topics of northern Chile. In 1980 it changed its name from ''Norte Grande'' to ''Revista de geografía Norte Grande'' reflecting a broadened scope to encompass all of Chile extending to Latin American topics.

'''Privy digging''' is the process of locating and investigating the contents of defunct [[outhouse]] vaults.  The purpose of privy digging is the salvage of antique bottles and everyday household artifacts from the past.  Privy digging is a form of [[historical digging]] and is often conducted on private residential properties.  Construction sites and major developments around older areas of towns and cities are also likely places to look for evidence of privies.

Historical contractors (privy diggers who enter into contracts enabling them to investigate vaults on commercial or industrial properties) are also engaging in privy digging.  Privies are also called pits, holes, and chambers.  In some locations, like New York City, vaults are sometimes referred to as “wells”, due to their appearance and often considerable depth.  In these instances well digging is synonymous with privy digging.

== Academic controversies ==
There are controversies regarding who should be permitted to investigate private residential privies and the historical significance of what is found in them.  From a conventional academic perspective, it is assumed that all privies contain vital and unique information which cannot be found elsewhere and that a costly forensic approach is required.  Privy diggers who are not professional archaeologists are labeled “looters”, even while working on sites which are in the process of being destroyed or have already been examined and worked by archaeologists.&lt;ref name=jordan&gt;{{Cite book|author=Jordan, S.|title=Past Objects|publisher=Mark Batty Publisher|place=New York|year=2010|isbn=978-0-9820754-3-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While both parties are engaging in similar activities, each is confronted with very different logistics, constraints, and unique opportunities for genuine discovery.

US academics responding to the threat of privy digging, dump digging, metal detecting, and so on have helped create laws protecting objects of a certain age, usually only 50–100 years old, from exploitation by opportunistic looters and other thieves that disturb historic context in pursuit of treasure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cr.nps.gov/local-law/FHPL_ArchRsrcsProt.pdf |title= Archaeological Resources Protection Act of 1979| accessdate=2011-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Laws intended to safeguard legitimate national and cultural treasures are applied to any item found while digging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pandozzi|first1=Frank|title=Metal Detecting Laws Controversial &amp; Unconstitutional, But You Need To Follow Them|url=https://www.metal-detecting-ghost-towns-of-the-east.com/metaldetectinglaws.html|website=Metal Detecting Ghost Towns of the East}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==Privies==
Privies can be constructed of stone, brick, or wood and vary considerably from place to place.&lt;ref name="Dantwell &amp; diZerega Wall"&gt;{{Cite book|author1=Cantwell, A.  |author2=diZerega Wall, D. |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Unearthing Gotham: The Archaeology of New York City|publisher=Yale University Press|year=2003|isbn=0-300-08415-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some privy vaults are less than 2 feet deep and others are more than 25 feet.  They can be as narrow as 2 feet or as wide as 10 feet, particularly in urban settings where a large privy shed with multiple doors and inner compartments once stood.  Some vaults are cylindrical, these are usually made of stone or brick.  Though there are cylindrical privies that are actual wooden barrels placed in the ground.  Others are rectangular and commonly made of stone, brick, or wood.  Many shallower rectangular vaults were only wood-lined.

Many privies were cleaned out periodically (“dipped”). This routine process addressed the growing concern for foul odors and airborne illnesses which was prevalent at the time.  Dipping also provided some of the necessary organic material for the fertilizer industry. Around the time that modern plumbing was installed, many were cleaned out and backfilled with newer material. These dipped vaults do not have an undisturbed night soil layer and the probability of one containing anything of major archaeological importance is extremely low.

== Sites ==
[[File:woodlined privy.jpg|thumb|300px|Excavating a small wood-lined privy located behind a residence which was built around 1876.]]
Most privies are located behind the building or buildings which they served.  In major urban areas, such as older cities on the US east coast, they are commonly found in the rear section of the residential lot and their size will vary considerably from place to place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Siegal|first1=Nina|title=MAKING IT WORK; Through Bottles, Darkly, Glimpses of the Past|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/05/30/nyregion/making-it-work-through-bottles-darkly-glimpses-of-the-past.html?scp=274&amp;sq=dappled&amp;st=nyt&amp;pagewanted=1|website=New York Times|date=May 30, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; Old fire insurance maps, such as [[Sanborn maps|Sanborn]], indicate that some properties were several lots wide and sometimes had two or more houses within the same boundary line.  In these instances only one privy vault may exist for all the houses being considered or one may exist for each.

In other cases structures apparently had no outlying property at all.  It is assumed that these particular vaults were incorporated into a neighboring lot or perhaps placed within the structure itself somewhere, possibly the basement.  Some insurance maps show outbuildings and sheds, and occasionally privy outlines too.  For example, 19th century insurance maps for New York City generally do not have markings indicating privy placements and some for New Jersey do. However, when researching the latter, privy diggers find no evidence that a privy ever existed where the map outline indicates one should be.

[[File:probing.jpg|thumb|300px|Investigating a barren wood-lined privy (ca. 1840).]]
Some privy diggers also research excavation sites where old houses and other buildings, such as factories, saloons, and hotels once were.  The use of heavy machinery can lead to indications of stone or brick structures and other subterranean anomalies being unearthed.  This in turn can lead to discoveries of privies, cisterns, root cellars, and trash pits.  Managers and owners of construction sites may not accommodate privy diggers on their missions to salvage on these sites.

Some of them are enthusiasts themselves and agreements can be formed allowing diggers to search for privy vaults and landfill deposits.  Some historical diggers focus exclusively on these kinds of sites and over time develop good relations with various development companies.  Permission to salvage on these sites can lead to remarkable discoveries with relatively little physical effort but this is the exception to the rule.

==Locating the privy vault==
When a property is determined to be old enough to have had an outhouse somewhere within its original boundaries, probing and test digging are the common methods for finding it.  The basic probe is made of [[spring steel]] and between 4’ and 6’ feet in length.  Many variations exist and each locale being probed has its own peculiarities regarding which equipment and what techniques should be applied.  Adept privy diggers develop considerable skill interpreting the faint residues which come up on the end of a probe and the subtle noise variations encountered while sliding it in and out of the ground.&lt;ref name=brater&gt;{{Cite book|author=Brater, E.|title=The Essentials of Privy Digging|publisher=e-Book|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Test digging involves making a small hole, and going down a few feet, to determine that a probe reading is accurate.  Once something other than dirt and rocks are being encountered and man-made objects are buried deeply in a particular spot, the outline of the privy is carefully excavated.  This can take hours or days depending on its size and the materials being dug through.  Dug dirt or “fluff” as it is sometimes called, is systematically removed from the hole by shoveling.  Deeper holes require a rope and bucket setup and sometimes a tripod mechanism to assist with the removal of material.

==Privy maintenance and garbage disposal==
[[File:bricklined privy.jpg|thumb|300px|Near the bottom of a brick-lined urban privy awaiting demolition (ca. 1855). During the [[Rescue archaeology|salvage dig]] excavators encountered an array of antique bottles and other interesting items which were manufactured in the 1850s, 1860s and 1870s.]]
Due to extreme odors and overfilling, a high percentage of privy vaults were cleaned out, to varying levels, while still in use.  This is commonly referred to as “dipping” among privy diggers.  The amount of dipping that occurred, how far down a well material was cleared and how frequently it was cleared, varied from privy to privy.  After plumbing was installed at the residence there was a final cleaning, which had a tendency of removing everything down to the deepest level of the vault.

Even at depths reaching 30 feet or more, some of the deepest vaults known to exist, many were cleaned to the base. Alternatively, a small percentage of shallow vaults extending down about 3 feet or less have contained noteworthy bottles, numerous fragments of dinner plates, cups, bowls, pitchers, tobacco pipes, clam and oyster shells, food bones and even sparse night soil pockets around the edges.

During the mid 19th century operators connected to the booming waste-generated fertilizer (night soil) business circulated cities and towns emptying vaults.  In rural areas where vaults are usually much smaller and shallower farmers and other property owners often conducted this task themselves.  Despite lying in human waste and other decaying refuse for years, many recyclable bottles of the time, and other reusable items, were retrieved during the dipping process.  Genuine garbage would be taken to landfills and other suitable locations and dumped, along with a never ending supply of stove and fireplace ashes.&lt;ref name=miller&gt;{{Cite book|author=Miller, B.|title=Fat of the Land: Garbage of New York-The Last Two Hundred Years|publisher=Basic Books|place=New York|year=2000|isbn=1-56858-172-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The evidence suggests that not all dippers were equally concerned with being meticulous and periodically dozens of bottles, and even some night soil, can still be found while privy digging.  The many out of place bottles sometimes discovered in clusters near the top or bottom of a dipped out vault are referred to by diggers as “kick-backs”, or “throw-ins”, and were left intentionally by the workers who cleaned out the privy.

Throughout the decades of the middle and late 19th century, the years diggers tend to focus on due to rapid changes in bottle manufacturing, privies were only incidental or sporadic dumping spots for bottles, kitchen garbage and other refuse.  Some privies were never used for that purpose at all and for practical reasons only a very small percentage of a household’s total trash could ever be distributed there.  Due to the enormous quantities of everyday garbage being produced by this time in history, not to mention the hundreds of millions of bottles sold each year in the United States alone, the vaults would have filled up very quickly requiring constant maintenance instead of being emptied just every so often.

Moreover, it was generally acceptable to dump reeking trash just about anywhere then without worrying about legal consequences.  Preferred places were lowland areas near the edges of towns and cities, down embankments and into ravines, rivers, streams, lakes, ponds, bogs, shorelines, backyard burning pits and other locales.  For example, New York City sent scows brimming with garbage out into the harbor everyday where very cheap labor shoveled it directly into the water without a second thought.&lt;ref name="miller"/&gt;  This process went on for centuries and an endless supply of collectable items, antiques and archaeological information alike remain in these dumping places to this day.

A sterile mixture of dirt, sand, rocks, ashes, brick bats and other worthless debris manufactured around 1880-1920 was used to backfill privies once plumbing was installed at a particular address.  With or without night soil deposits remaining down below there is no longer any offensive odor.

== Items recovered ==
[[File:Yale_bottle.gif|thumb|200px|An iron pontiled soda or beer bottle, ca. 1855.]]
Privy digging is directly linked to antique bottle collecting. Glass or clay bottles are the most likely items to be found in an average 19th century privy. Yet, more often than not they are found prohibitively damaged. This may be due to the large number of brickbats and stones which are found at all levels of the privy.  Excavators have theorized that at least some of them were thrown in with the intention of crushing down the contents of the vault, so it could be used longer without needing to be cleaned.  The high percentage of broken items is one reason why privy digging is one of the most unpredictable and arduous methods of attempting to form a bottle collection.

Pontiled medicine bottles, ink bottles, beer and soda bottles, and many others, particularly those manufactured between the 1830s-1860s are among the most sought after and can sell for thousands of dollars each.  However, in reality an average pontiled find discovered while privy digging is worth less than twenty dollars.  Even these are not discovered consistently in most locations.

Not unlike old stamps and coins invariably they are required to be in mint or very good condition to be sufficiently interesting to a serious bottle collector.  An enormous quantity of rare bottles are known to exist in private collections, museums, museum and university basements, and elsewhere but these prime examples are seldom found on average privy digs.  In fact a high percentage of all valuable bottles and related containers were never buried in privies, dumps or elsewhere; these are known as “attic” bottles among privy diggers and bottle collectors.

There are exceptions and over time some groups of regularly active diggers, operating in good locations, will encounter thousands of antique bottles and other interesting things. The vast majority of items will be very common examples of nominal value and not very useful to serious collectors, historians, or archaeologists.

Not unlike dump diggers privy diggers may also encounter miscellaneous tableware (banded ware,&lt;ref name=sussman&gt;{{Cite book|author=Sussman, L.|title=Mocha, Banded, Cat’s Eye, and Other Factory-Made Slipware|publisher=Studies in Northeast Historical Archaeology|year=1997 }}&lt;/ref&gt; redware, mocha,&lt;ref name=rickard&gt;{{Cite book|author=Rickard, J.|title=Mocha and related dipped wares, 1770-1939 |publisher=University Press of New England|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other slipwares), stoneware, occasionally clay pipes, doll parts, tea set pieces, [[marble (toy)|marbles]], buttons, chamber pots, decorative porcelain pot lids&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.deantiques.com/PLG/|title=Antique Pot Lid Gallery|accessdate=2011-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; and bases used for pomades and skin creams, bone or ivory toothbrush handles, hard-rubber combs and hair picks, ambrotypes, and other objects which are usually broken or damaged.&lt;ref name="jordan"/&gt;

Most of these items were valueless and intentionally discarded into the privy, others fell through the opening in the outhouse seat, and some were lost at the hands of small children.&lt;ref name="de sola mendez"&gt;{{Cite book|author=de Sola Mendez, E.|title=Tiny Treasures|publisher=Dollhouse Miniatures|page=28|year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In each instance the insides of active vaults were very caustic environments, the highly toxic ingredients causing most things to break down and rot very quickly.

== Related topics and history ==
Privy diggers, along with dump diggers and other historical diggers are enthusiastic about making their own discoveries and will get sufficiently dirty as a result.  Though there are some exceptions this work is usually done by hand and requires a remarkable degree of persistence and tenacity.  Career level diggers are obsessive by nature, sometimes achieving considerable skill with the various forms of privy digging techniques available.  Some privy diggers also use a metal detector to pinpoint old coins and other easy to miss metal objects. Some privy diggers are metal detectorists and some metal detectorists are also privy diggers, dump diggers and so on.  However, each designation is a specific subject on its own.

[[File:stone privy well.jpg|thumb|300px|Excavating a large stone-lined urban privy during a major property renovation (ca. 1851).]]
Privy digging has things in common with [[dump digging]] and to some degree treasure hunting and garbology but is none of these exclusively as it involves salvaging the contents of defunct privies more than anything else.  Privy digging and dump digging are equally concerned with antique bottles and related items.  Though many exceptions exist in most instances even the oldest dump-bottles are not as old as privy bottles can be.

Dumps are commonly associated with bottles and trash manufactured between the 1880s-1920s.  This was a time when everyday bottles were being mass-produced annually by the hundreds of millions.  They were reused less and often thrown away rather than recycled due to their relatively inexpensive production costs.

Many bottles were still being mouth-blown and their lips formed by assorted tooling devices as late as 1915-20.  The patent for the first fully automatic bottle machine, the Owens Automatic Bottle Machine, was not issued until 1903.  And by 1906 it was swiftly replacing the old method at glasshouses nationwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sha.org/bottle/glassmaking.htm#|title= Bureau of Land Management and Society for Historic Archaeology: Historic Glass Bottle Identification &amp; Information Website| accessdate=2011-07-15 |work=Glassmaking &amp; Glassmakers }}&lt;/ref&gt;   Early examples of machine made bottles manufactured between about 1906 and 1915 often resemble their predecessors in shape and color and can be nominally valuable for that reason.

Whether found in privies or dumps late period mouth-blown bottles manufactured between about 1880-1915 have a lesser amount of serious collectable potential depending on rarity, condition and color.  Dug bottles manufactured between 1880 and 1915 have sold for hundreds or even thousands of dollars but statistically this is very rare.

Although privy diggers usually attempt to focus on the contents of vaults built before the Civil War, these too can also contain bottles made as late as the 1920s or later up near the top.  Depending on when a vault went into permanent disuse it could contain bottles and debris deposited as late as the second half of the 20th century.  According to a 1950 census 50 million homes reported no indoor plumbing. In 1990 more than 4 million old style privies were still in use coast to coast.&lt;ref name=barlow&gt;{{Cite book|author=Barlow, R.|title=The Vanishing American Outhouse|publisher=Studio|place=New York|year=2000|isbn=0-14-028868-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  No matter what is encountered near the top assuming a given vault was active in 1850 its potential for older bottles lying at a lower section has a consistently strong draw for serious privy diggers.

Whether mold blown or free blown (both forms of mouth-blowing and considered hand made), most bottles produced before 1860-65 have a distinct scar on their base.  This mark is the result of removing the pontil rod.  Something which was temporarily fused to the base in order to handle them effectively while they were still exceedingly hot, as their necks and lips were being tooled at the glassworks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sha.org/bottle/glassmaking.htm#|title= Burea of Land Management and Society for Historic Archaeology: Historic Glass Bottle Identification &amp; Information Website| accessdate=2011-11-26 |work=Glassmaking &amp; Glassmakers }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The decades just prior to the absence of pontil rods from bottle-glass making were a time when endless variations pertaining to shape, size, style, color and embossing were being produced regularly in an unprecedented quantity.  Some of the most interesting bottles were manufactured during this time; 1830s-1860s.

Even after the pontil rod was replaced by assorted clamping mechanisms known as “snap cases”, many bottles were still being created in the same interesting molds and sold in huge quantities annually.  These are known as smooth base bottles and are sometimes found in privies which were in use after the 1860s and as late as the 1880s.  Visually, the difference between an early smooth base and a pontiled example of exactly the same bottle is insignificant but to a collector it often means everything.  Rare early smooth base bottles can occasionally be as valuable as rare pontiled bottles but statistically they are unlikely to be discovered with any regularity on average privy digs.

[[File:Larix laricina.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Subarctic vegetation in Canada ([[Larix laricina]])]]  
The '''subarctic'''  is a region in the [[Northern Hemisphere]] immediately south of the true [[Arctic]] and covering much of [[Alaska]], [[Canada]], [[Iceland]], the north of [[Scandinavia]], [[Siberia]], and the [[Shetland Islands]]. Generally, subarctic regions fall between 50°N and 70°N [[latitude]], depending on local climates.

== Climate and soils ==

Monthly temperatures are above {{convert|10|°C|°F}} for at least one and at most three months of the year.  Precipitation tends to be low due to the low moisture content of the cold air.  Precipitation is typically greater in warmer months, with a summer maximum ranging from moderate in [[North America]] to extreme in the [[Russian Far East]]. Except in the wettest areas glaciers are not large because of the lack of winter precipitation; in the wettest areas, however, glaciers tend to be very abundant and [[Pleistocene]] [[glaciation]] covered even the lowest elevations. [[Soil]]s of the subarctic are generally very [[acidic]] largely because of the influence of the vegetation both in the taiga and in [[peat]]y [[bog]]s, which tends to acidify the soil, as well as the extreme ease with which leaching of nutrients takes place even in the most heavily glaciated regions. The dominant soil orders are [[podsols]] and further north [[gelisols]].

Subarctic regions are often characterized by [[taiga]] forest vegetation, though where winters are relatively mild, as in [[northern Norway]], [[Temperate broadleaf and mixed forest|broadleaf forest]] may occur—though in some cases soils remain too saturated almost throughout the year to sustain ''any'' [[tree]] growth and the dominant vegetation is a peaty herbland dominated by [[grass]]es and [[sedge]]s. Typically, there are only a few species of large terrestrial [[mammal]]s in the subarctic regions, the most important being elk, [[moose]] (''Alces alces''), [[bear]]s, [[reindeer]] (''Rangifer tarandus''), and [[wolf|wolves]] (''Canis lupus''). [[Agriculture]] is mainly limited to [[animal husbandry]], though in some areas [[barley]] can be grown. Canada and Siberia are very rich in minerals, notably [[nickel]], [[molybdenum]], [[cobalt]], [[lead]], [[zinc]] and [[uranium]], whilst the [[Grand Banks]] and [[Sea of Okhotsk]] are two of the richest [[fishery|fisheries]] in the world and provide support for many small towns.

[[File:Fagerfjeliet.jpg|thumb|right|320px|In [[Fennoscandia]] and northwestern [[Russia]], oceanic influences soften winter temperatures; the lack of permafrost allow agriculture and infrastructure. [[Lenvik]], Norway, at 69°N.]]

Except for those areas adjacent to warm [[ocean current]]s, there is almost always continuous [[permafrost]] due to the very cold winters. This means that building in most subarctic regions is very difficult and expensive: cities are very few ([[Murmansk]] being the largest) and generally small, whilst [[road]]s are few. Subarctic rail transport only exists in Europe (lines to [[Narvik]] and Murmansk) and the [[Norilsk]]–[[Dudinka]] line in northern Siberia. An important consequence is that transportation tends to be restricted to [[Bush airplane|"bush" planes]], [[helicopter]]s and, in summer, [[riverboat]]s.

==Economy==

Except for a few parts of [[Europe]] where the winters are relatively mild due to prevailing wind and ocean current patterns, subarctic regions were not explored until the 18th and 19th centuries. Even then, the difficulty of transportation ensured that few settlements (most of them created for [[mining]]) lasted long—the abandoned, once-thriving cities of the [[Yukon]], [[Northwest Territories]] and increasingly Siberia illustrate this.

The [[Trans-Siberian Railway]], which skirts the edge of the region, provided a major boost to Russian settlement in the subarctic, as did the intensive industrialization under [[Joseph Stalin]] that relied on the enormous mineral resources of the [[Central Siberian Plateau]]. Today, many towns in subarctic Russia are declining precipitously as mines close. In Canada, after the early minerals ran out, development stalled until [[hydroelectricity|hydroelectric]] development occurred in the 1950s and 1960s. [[Hydro-Quebec]] in particular has carried out many engineering works in regions of near-continuous permafrost, but these have never supported a significant population and have mainly served densely populated southern [[Quebec]].

[[Tourism]] in recent years has become a major source of revenue for most countries of the subarctic due to the beautiful, generally glacial, landscapes so characteristic of the region. Most areas in the subarctic are among the most expensive places in the world to visit, due to both high costs of living and inaccessibility. Nonetheless, the great opportunities for [[outdoor recreation]] lure an ever-increasing number of travelers. At the same time, the older industries of the subarctic (fishing, mining, hydroelectric power) are being threatened by both [[Environmentalism|environmental opposition]] and [[overfishing]] leading to depleted stocks of commercially important species.

[[File:SudanRegionGambia.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Typical landscape of the Sudan region]]
The '''Sudan''' is the geographic region to the south of the [[Sahara]], stretching from Western to eastern Central Africa. The name derives from the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] ''{{transl|ar|bilād as-sūdān}}'' ({{lang|ar|بلاد السودان}}), or "the lands of the [[Black people|blacks]]", referring to [[West Africa]] and northern [[Central Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | author = International Association for the History of Religions | title = Numen | publisher = EJ Brill | place = Leiden | year = 1959 | page = 131 | quote = West Africa may be taken as the country stretching from Senegal in the west, to the Cameroons in the east; sometimes it has been called the central and western Sudan, the ''Bilad as-Sūdan'', ‘Land of the Blacks’, of the Arabs}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Arabic name was translated as ''[[Negroland]]'' on older English maps.

Historically, the name was understood to denote the western part of the [[Sahel]] region. It thus roughly encompassed the geographical belt between the Sahara and the [[Guinea (region)|coastal West Africa]]. In modern usage, the phrase "The Sudan" is also used in a separate context to refer specifically to the present-day country of [[Sudan]], the [[Darfur|western part]] of which forms part of the larger region, and from which [[South Sudan]] gained its independence in 2011.

The Sudan region extends in some 5,000&amp;nbsp;km in a band several hundred kilometers wide across Africa. It stretches from the border of [[Senegal]], through southern [[Mali]] (formerly known as [[French Sudan]] when it was a [[list of French possessions and colonies|French colony]]), [[Burkina Faso]], southern [[Niger]], northern [[Nigeria]], northern [[Ghana]], southern [[Chad]], the western [[Darfur]] region of present-day [[Sudan]], and [[South Sudan]].

To the north of the region lies the [[Sahel]], a more arid [[Acacia]] [[savanna]] region that in turn borders the [[Sahara|Sahara Desert]] further north, and to the east the [[Ethiopian Highlands]] (called ''al-Ḥabašah'' in Arabic). In the southwest lies the [[Sudanian Savanna|West Sudanian Savanna]], a wetter, [[tropical savanna]] region bordering the [[tropical forest|tropical forests]] of [[West Africa]]. In the center is [[Lake Chad]], and the more fertile region around the lake, while to the south of there are the [[Western High Plateau|highlands]] of [[Cameroon]]. To the southeast is the [[East Sudanian Savanna]], another tropical savanna region, bordering the forest of [[Central Africa]]. This gives way further east to the [[Sudd]], an area of tropical [[wetland]] fed by the water of the [[White Nile]].

== Habitation ==
The people of the Sudan region share similar lifestyles, dictated by the geography of the region.  The economy is largely [[pastoral]], while [[sorghum]] and [[oryza glaberrima|rice]] are cultivated in the southern parts of the region.

The region was governed in colonial times by European powers, including the French and the British, as part of their African colonial empires, but the countries of the region achieved independence in the latter half of the 20th century.

[[File:Young George Washington.jpg|thumb|200px|A youthful George Washington surveying at Pope's Creek, Virginia.]]
The history of '''[[surveying]] in early America''' included the mapping of large, unknown territories and the layout of the [[District of Columbia]]. Several presidents were involved, including George Washington.

==The Founding Father as surveyor==
[[George Washington]] was not only a founding political father of the U.S., he was a founding surveyor of Virginia, as well. At the age of eleven, he inherited [[Ferry Farm]]. When George reached school age, instead of a career in the [[Royal Navy]], George went to school to study surveying and geometry. His first surveying tools were from his own storehouse on Ferry Farm.&lt;ref name="GW"&gt;[http://frontiers.loc.gov/ammem/gmdhtml/gwmaps.html Frontiers: George Washington, surveyor and mapmaker]&lt;/ref&gt; At the age of 17, under the tutelage of [[Joshua Fry]], he surveyed the northern neck of Virginia and became the county surveyor for [[Culpeper County, Virginia]]. By the time of the [[French and Indian War]], he had laid out most of northern Virginia, and this knowledge would contribute to his success during the war.

From 1747 to 1799, he surveyed 200 tracts of land, and due to his also being a land speculator, he amassed {{convert|65000|acres|km2}} of land.&lt;ref name="GW" /&gt;

During the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]], he appointed the first geographer of the [[Continental Army]], [[Robert Erskine]].

==Surveying the District of Columbia==
Surveying was not only for the wealthy plantation owners, but the entire new nation needed to be surveyed, and resurveyed. Most of all, the proposed new capital city, bearing Washington’s name, needed to be surveyed. A two-man team would survey what became the District of Columbia in 1791. The first was [[Benjamin Banneker]], a free ex-slave, who learned to read, write, and do math from his grandmother. Banneker would go on to be a leading astronomer, mathematician, clock maker, and most of all, a surveyor. The second man was [[Andrew Ellicott]]. He would go on to do several prominent surveys of the area and assist [[Lewis and Clark]] in planning their expedition.

==The training of a naturalist==
[[File:Jefferson statue detail North Grounds UVa.jpg|thumb|left|225px|Statue of Jefferson surveying a site for the [[University of Virginia]]]]
Prior to independence, [[Peter Jefferson]], along with his son [[Thomas Jefferson]], were land surveyors for the crown. At this time, surveyors used a system known as the [[metes and bounds]] system, which used "monuments"; identifiable objects such as rocks, trees etc., as property markers. The surveyor would measure from monument to monument. The major problem with this system was the fact that these monuments were not necessarily permanent. As a result, Thomas Jefferson was involved in the creation the [[Public Land Survey System]]. A comparison of county boundaries in the various states graphically displays the difference between the systems, as counties in the Eastern states are irregularly shaped whereas counties in the Midwest tend to be square or rectangular.

Needing money to pay the debts for the Revolutionary War, Jefferson began selling land in the [[Northwest Territory]] in plots of {{convert|160|acres|m2}} for $2.50 an acre. Soon after, he sold the land in plots of {{convert|80|acres|m2}} for 1.25 an acre. The NW Territory was surveyed using the Rectangular System. This system used a central point determined by a Principal North-South Meridian Line and an East-West Base line.

Jefferson convinced Congress to accept the land deal with [[Napoleon]]. As a result of the [[Louisiana Purchase]] and Jefferson’s love for nature, Jefferson organized the Lewis and Clark expedition. Andrew Ellicott taught Lewis and Clark how to use a [[sextant]] to map their position. Lewis and Clark would leave from [[Wood River, Illinois]] and document the wilderness all the way to the Pacific Ocean.

==Lincoln: politics and surveying==
Abraham Lincoln came to [[New Salem, Menard County, Illinois|New Salem]] in 1831, and shortly after in 1832, he lost in his bid to become a state representative. The [[Sangamon County]] Surveyor, John Calhoun, then offered Lincoln a job as Deputy Surveyor due to the high volume of resurveying.

As Deputy Surveyor, Lincoln surveyed five towns, four roads, and thirty properties. The first was the [[plat]] for Huron, a proposed town {{convert|30|mi|km}} North of Springfield that never came to be. The proposal was that county would build a canal to straighten the [[Sangamon River]], but the canal was never built. The last town Lincoln laid out was [[New Boston, Illinois|New Boston]], a town at the confluence of the [[Iowa River]] and the Mississippi River. Instead of payment for his work, Lincoln had his surveying equipment repossessed and sold. Unknown to Lincoln, Jimmy Short, a friend, bought all of his equipment, his horse, and his saddlebags. Short returned Lincoln’s surveying equipment and later, as president, Lincoln returned the favor by making Short the [[Indian Agent]] of the Round Lake Indian Reservation.

'''Szepes''' ({{lang-sk|Spiš}}; {{lang-la|Scepusium}}, {{lang-pl|Spisz}}, {{lang-de|link=no|Zips}}) was an administrative county of the [[Kingdom of Hungary]], called Scepusium before the late 19th century. Its territory today lies in northeastern [[Slovakia]], with a very small area in southeastern Poland. For the current region, see [[Spiš]].

==Geography==
[[Image:Spis Castle, Slovakia.jpg|thumb|300px|left|Spiš Castle (Szepesi vár)]]

Szepes county shared borders with Poland and with the counties as follows: [[Liptov County|Liptó]], [[Gemer|Gömör]], [[Abaúj County|Abaúj]] and [[Sáros County|Sáros]]. After the late 18th century dismemberment of Poland, the border was with the Austrian province of [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galicia]]. Its area was 3,668&amp;nbsp;km² in 1910. The county became part of [[Czechoslovakia]], apart from a [[Czechoslovak-Polish border dispute (1918-1947)|very small area now in Poland]], after [[World War I]], and is now part of Slovakia (and Poland).

===Capitals===
The original seat of government of Szepes county was [[Spiš Castle]] (Hungarian: Szepesi vár), which was constructed in the 12th century. Unofficially from the 14th century, and officially from the 16th century, until 1918 the capital of the county was Lőcse (present-day [[Levoča]]).

===Subdivisions===
From the beginning of the 15th century, the county was subdivided into three [[Processus (Kingdom of Hungary)|processuses]]. The number was changed to four in 1798. In the second half of the 19th century, the number of processuses (districts) was increased.

In the early 20th century, the subdivisions of the county Szepes were (town names first in Hungarian, then in Slovak, then in German):

==History==

This article only covers the history of Szepes when it was part of the Kingdom of Hungary (approx. 11th century – 1918). For a complete history of the region see [[Spiš]].

===Early history===

The southern part of Szepes was conquered by the Kingdom of Hungary at the end of the 11th century{{Citation needed|reason=no source supporting the date of conquest|date=September 2013}}, when the border of the Kingdom ended near Késmárk (present-day [[Kežmarok]]). The royal county of Szepes (''comitatus Scepusiensis'') was created in the second half of the 12th century. In the 1250s, the border of the Kingdom of Hungary shifted to the north to Podolin (present-day [[Podolínec]]) and in 1260 – in the northwest – to the [[Dunajec]] river. The northeastern region around Gnézda (present-day [[Hniezdne]]) and Ólubló (present-day [[Stará Ľubovňa]]) (the so-called "districtus Podoliensis") were incorporated only in the 1290s. The northern border of the county stabilized in the early 14th century. Around 1300, the royal county became a noble county.

The subsidiary of the Hungarian Chamber (the supreme [[Habsburg Empire|Habsburg]] financial and economy institution in [[History of Hungary|the Kingdom of Hungary]]) responsible for eastern territories (i.e. not only for Szepes) was called the ''Szepes Chamber'' (''Zipser Kammer'' in German), and it existed from 1563 to 1848. Its seat was the town of Kassa (present-day [[Košice]]), sometimes Eperjes, (present-day [[Prešov]]).

====Counts of Szepes====
The rulers of the county were from the following Hungarian noble families:
*[[János Szapolyai|Zápolya]] (1464–1527)
*[[Thurzó family|Thurzó]] (1531–1636)
*[[Csáky]] (1638–1848)

===Sedes of the ten lance-bearers===
Until 1802, there was a [[Seat (territorial-administrative unit)|Seat]] or 'Parvus comitatus', known as 'Sedes superior' (upper county) or 'Sedes X lanceatorum' (county of the ten lance-bearers), which was situated to the east of Poprad in present-day southern Spiš, and whose origin is unknown. From the 12th century onwards, its inhabitants were known as the "guardians of the northern border." The territory of the county was populated by [[Germans]], [[Hungarians]] and [[Slavs]] ''(Theotonicis, Hungaris et Sclavis)''.&lt;ref&gt;Attila Zsoldos, Imre Szentpétery:[http://www.tti.hu/images/kiadvanyok/online/zsoldos.pdf ''Regesta ducum, ducissarum stirpis Arpadianae necnon reginarum Hungariae critico-diplomatica.''] Budapest, MTA, 2008. p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1802, when its inhabitants decided to merge the sedes with Szepes county, it included the following settlements: Ábrahámfalva/[[Abrahámovce, Kežmarok|Abrahámovce]], Betlenfalva/[[Betlanovce]], Filefalva/Filice (today part of [[Gánovce]]), Hadusfalu/Hadušovce (today part of [[Spišské Tomášovce]]), Primfalu/[[Hôrka]] (including Kišovce, Svätý Ondrej, Primovce), Hozelecz/[[Hozelec]], Jánócz/[[Jánovce]] (including Čenčice), Komarócz/Komárov, Lefkóc/Levkovce (today part of [[Vlková]]), and Mahálfalva/Machalovce (today part of Jánovce). Originally more villages were included.

The 'lance-bearers' were [[squire]]s. The "sedes" was a collection of non-contiguous areas, which did not constitute a continuous territory. It had an autonomous government, similar to that of normal Hungarian counties, but was partly subordinated to the head of Szepes county. Until the 15th century, its capital was Csütörtökhely/Štvrtok/Donnersmark (present-day [[Spišský Štvrtok]] - which was not part of the sedes territories); following this there were various capitals, and after 1726 the capital was Betlenfalva/Betlensdorf (present-day [[Betlanovce]]).

===Arrival of the Germans===
Many of the towns of Szepes developed from German colonization of existing Slovak settlements. The German settlers had been invited to the territory from the mid-12th century onwards. The major immigration came following the devastating [[Mongol]] invasion of 1242, which turned Szepes, like other parts of the Kingdom of Hungary, into a largely depopulated area (some 50% of the population was lost). There was no significant Slavic population remaining and as it was a part of Hungary, King [[Béla IV of Hungary]] invited Germans to colonize the Szepes and other regions (covering parts of present-day Slovakia, present-day Hungary and [[Transylvania]]). The settlers were mostly traders and miners. The settlements founded by them in the southern parts (Szepesség) were mainly mining settlements (later towns). Consequently, until World War II, Spiš had a large [[ethnic German|German]] population (see [[Carpathian Germans]]). The last wave of Germans arrived in the 15th century.

In the early 13th century, the people of Szepes created their own religious organization called the "Brotherhood of the 24 royal parish priests", which received many privileges from the local [[Provost (religion)|provost]]. It was re-established after the Tatar invasion in 1248.

At the same time, the German settlements of the Hernád (present-day Hornád) and Poprád (present-day Poprad) basins created a special political territory with its own administration. They received collective privileges from King [[Stephen V of Hungary|Stephen V]] in 1271, which were confirmed and extended by King [[Charles I of Hungary|Charles I]] in 1317, because the Szepesian Germans had helped him to defeat the [[oligarchy|oligarch]]s of the Kingdom of Hungary in the battle at [[Rozgony]] (present-day Rozhanovce) in 1312. The territory was granted self-government privileges similar to those of the [[royal free towns]]. In 1317, the special territory included 43 settlements, including [[Lőcse]] (present-day Levoča) and [[Késmárk]] (present-day Kežmarok), which however withdrew before 1344. From 1370 the 41 settlements of the territory subscribed to a uniform special Szepes law system (called ''Zipser Willkür'' in German). Initially, the special territory was called "Communitas (or Provincia) Saxonum de Scepus". By the mid-14th century, the territory was reduced to 24 settlements and later the name was changed to ''Provincia XXIV oppidorum terrae Scepusiensis'' in Latin (''Bund der 24 Zipser Städte'' in German [i.e. Province/Union of 24 Szepes towns]). The province was led by the [[Count]] (''[[Graf]]'') of Szepes elected by the town judges of the 24 towns.

There was yet another privileged territory in Szepes. Until 1465, the privileged German mining towns in southern Szepes (e.g. Göllnitz/Gölnicbánya/Gelnica, Schwedler/Svedlér/Švedlár, Einseidel/Szepesremete/Mníšek nad Hnilcom, Helzmanowitz/Helcmanóc/Helcmanovce, Prakendorf/Prakfalva/Prakovce, Vagendrussel/Merény/Vondrišel (today called Nálepkovo), Jeckelsdorf/Jekelfalva/Jaklovce, Margetzan/Margitfalu/Margecany, Schmölnitz/Szomolnok/Smolník, Höfen/Szalánk/Slovinky, and Krompach/Korompa/Krompachy) were also exempt from the power of the Count of Szepes.

===The Pawning of Szepes towns and the Province of 13 Szepes Towns===
[[File:Square of Spisska Sobota 6.jpg|thumb|250px|Medieval square in [[Spišská Sobota]]]]
The Province of 24 Szepes towns was dissolved in 1412, when, by the [[Treaty of Lubowla]] King [[Sigismund of Luxembourg]], ruler of Hungary, [[Pledge (law)|pawned]] 13 of the towns of the former Province, as well as the territory around the Ólubló (present-day [[Stará Ľubovňa]]) (i.e. the royal domain Lubló, plus [[Hniezdne|Gnézda]] and [[Podolínec|Podolin]], and several villages) to Poland, in exchange for the amount of 37,000 Czech sixty-[[groschen]] coins, that is, approximately 7 tonnes of pure silver. This was to finance his war against the [[Republic of Venice]].&lt;ref&gt;Krempaska (2012), 2–5. Similar short-time pledges (without interest payments) were not uncommon at that time (e.g. the pawning of the [[Nyitra county]], [[Pozsony county]], the [[Brandenburg]] marches etc.)&lt;/ref&gt; The pledged towns were to be returned to the Kingdom of Hungary as soon as the loan was repaid; nobody expected the pledge would take 360 years to redeem (from 1412 to 1772).

From 1412 the pawned towns were officially known as the "Province of 13 Szepes Towns" (although it included also the three towns in the territory of Ólubló, making a total of 16 towns). It was led by a count elected each year by a council including representatives of the towns, past mayors, and the previous count.&lt;ref&gt;Krempaska (2012), 8.&lt;/ref&gt; The 13 main pawned settlements did not form a continuous territory. They included: Leibic (present-day [[Ľubica]]), Poprád (present-day [[Poprad]]), Mateóc (Matejovce, today in Poprad), Szepesszombat ([[Spišská Sobota]], today in Poprad), Strázsa (Stráže pod Tatrami, today in Poprad), Felka (Veľká, today in Poprad), Ruszkin (Ruskinovce, no longer in existence, located in the military training area Javorina near Kežmarok), Szepesbéla (present-day Spišská Belá), Igló (present-day [[Spišská Nová Ves]]), Szepesváralja (present-day [[Spišské Podhradie]]), Szepesolaszi (present-day [[Spišské Vlachy]]), Duránd (present-day [[Tvarožná, Kežmarok District|Tvarožná]]), and Ménhárd (present-day [[Vrbov]]).

The towns kept their privileged status (now in [[fealty]] to the [[King of Poland|Polish kings]] who did not alter their privileges). The Polish king ceded his interest in the towns to Count [[Sebastian Lubomirski]] in 1593, whose family then became effectively the proprietors of the province.&lt;ref&gt;Krempaska (2012), 9–10.&lt;/ref&gt;

The remaining 11 of the former 24 Szepes towns, which created the "Province/Union of 11 Szepes towns" in 1412, were not able to maintain their privileges. As early as 1465 they were fully incorporated into the Szepes county, i.e. they became subjects of the lords of the [[Spiš Castle]]. Some of them gradually turned into simple villages and lost their German privileges. Having privileges from both the Polish and the Hungarian crowns gave the "Province of 13" to significant commercial advantages over Lőcse (present-day [[Levoča]]) and other towns in the "Province of 11".&lt;ref&gt;Krempaska (2012), 22–3.&lt;/ref&gt;

The pawned territories remained politically a part of the Kingdom of Hungary (and of its [[Esztergom]] [[diocese]]), while the revenue from the territories went to Poland. Poland also held some administrative powers in the area and was entitled to appoint a governor/administrator (''[[starosta]]'') for the territories, with his seat in Lubló, to manage them economically (especially to collect tax revenues) and to position guards at important road crossings even outside the pawned territories. One of the first Polish governors of Szepes was the famous knight [[Zawisza Czarny]]. Due to their complex political and economic status (German towns with Slovak subjects, although the number of Slovaks in the towns was less than 5% in the area pawned to Poland), the towns declined economically.

Attempts of the Kingdom of Hungary to repay the debt (most notably in 1419, 1426, and 1439) failed and later the will (or ability) to pay declined. After alleged mistreatment of the towns – especially by [[Teodor Konstanty Lubomirski]], [[Maria Josepha of Austria]] (queen consort of [[August III of Poland]]), and  Count [[Heinrich Brühl]]  – [[Maria Theresa of Austria]] decided to recover them by force. She took advantage of the [[szlachta|Polish noble insurrections]] in the second half of the 18th century and occupied the towns in 1769 (with the apparent consent of the then Polish king [[Stanislaus II of Poland]]) without debt repayment. This act was confirmed by the [[Partitions of Poland|First Partition of Poland]] in 1772. In 1773, the pawn was cancelled. In 1778, the 13 towns regained their privileges of 1271, the privileges were extended to the other three previously pawned towns, and this newly formed entity was named "Province of 16 Szepes towns". The capital of the province was Igló, also known as Neudorf and later as [[Spišská Nová Ves]]. However, the privileges were gradually reduced and some 100 years later only religious and cultural rights remained. Finally, the province was dissolved altogether and incorporated into Szepes county in 1876.

===16th–19th centuries===
{{Expand section|date=January 2007}}
The Szepes county (today:Spiš region) prospered not only from being situated on trade routes, but also from its natural resources of wood, agriculture and, until relatively recent times, mining. In the 15th century and later, iron, copper and silver were all exploited in the south of the region. Its relative wealth during this period, and its mixture of nationalities and religions, resulted in it becoming a major cultural centre – many schools were founded, and the town of Lőcse (present-day Levoča) became a major centre for printing in the 17th century. The buildings and churches of the region's towns, and the skills of schools such as those of the carver [[Master Paul of Levoča]] testify to this affluence and culture. Until the end of the 17th century, the area was often disrupted by wars, uprisings against the [[Habsburg]]s, and epidemics (a plague of 1710/1711 killed over 20,000). But from the 18th century onwards, relative stability enabled faster economic development. Many craft guilds were founded and by the end of the 18th century over 500 iron mines were operative in the south.

Such prosperity naturally meant that the churches paid great interest to the region. А [[Lutheran]] [[synod]], the so-called Synod of Szepesváralja, took place in Szepesváralja (present-day Spišské Podhradie) in 1614. It discussed the [[Protestant]] organisation of the Szepes and [[Sáros County|Sáros]] counties. In the Catholic sphere, a separate Szepes [[Diocese|Bishopric]] was created in 1776 with its seat at Szepeshely (present-day [[Spišská Kapitula]]).

The spirit of nationalism, growing in the 19th century, moved also in Spiš. In 1868, 21 settlements of Szepes sent their demands, the 'Szepes Petition', to the Diet of the Kingdom of Hungary, requesting special status for [[Slovaks]] within the Kingdom.

In 1871, the railway came to Szepes and this was to have profound consequences. On the one hand, it enabled economic and industrial expansion. On the other, it bypassed the old capital of the region, Lőcse (now Levoča), and favoured the growth of centres on its route, such as Poprád (now Poprad) and Igló (now [[Spišská Nová Ves]]).

In the aftermath of World War I, Szepes county became part of newly formed Czechoslovakia, as recognized by the concerned states in the 1920 [[Treaty of Trianon]].

===Nationalities===
According to censuses carried out in the Kingdom of Hungary in 1869 (and later in 1900 and 1910) the population of Szepes county comprised the following nationalities: Slovaks 50.4%, (58.2%, 58%), Germans 35% (25%, 25%), Ruthenians ([[Rusyns]]{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}) 13.8% (8.4%, 8%) and 0.7% (6%, 6%) Magyars (Hungarians). The sudden increase in listed Hungarians after 1869 may be due to statistical interpretation (use of "most frequently used language" as criterion); it may also be attributable to assimilation, [[Magyarisation]], most notably of the German minority. The figures do not make clear how Jews were categorised, but their numbers must have been substantial as many of the towns had synagogues (one survives in [[Spišské Podhradie]]) and Jewish cemeteries still survive in Kežmarok, Levoča and elsewhere.

Up until now, there is a significant population (about 40,000 to 48,000 estimated) of ethnic [[Poles]]{{Dubious |reason=A fiction which is not based on any serious statistics. In 2011 cenzus, only 3 084 citizens (in Slovakia, not only in Spis) declared Polish nationality.|date=December 2016}} (practitally without any exception, the [[Gorals]] using polish dialect of Szepes region). The Hungarian censuses ignored the Polish nationality, all ethnic Poles were registered as [[Slovaks]]. There was also a very strong process of [[Slovakization]] of Polish people throughout 18th–20th centuries, mostly done by Roman Catholic Church, in which institution the local aboriginal Polish priests were replaced with Slovak ones. Also the institution of schooling was replacing the polish language with slovak language during classes.&lt;ref&gt;M. Kaľavský, Narodnostné pomery na Spiši v 18. storočí a v 1. polovici 19. storočia, Bratislava 1993, s. 79–107&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J.Dudášová-Kriššáková, Goralské nárečia, Bratislava 1993&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Spisz i Orawa w 75. rocznicę powrotu do Polski północnych części obu ziem, T. M. Trajdos (red.), Kraków 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

Up until the 12th century, there were no Hungarians (except the area of The Spis Castle and the Church of Saint Martin) in the region. The Slovak and German inhabitants came to Szepes in following centuries in a process of colonitazion the Carpathian wilds by Hungarian Crown . All localities were inhabited by Poles, as a result of a natural process of colonizing the lands along the rivers, going up-stream. In this case, the river was Poprád river ([[Poprad (river)|today Poprad]]) which flows into the [[Vistula]] and thus belongs to the drainage basin of the [[Baltic Sea]] (as opposed to nearby [[Hornad]] and [[Vah]], and all other Slovak rivers; Poprad is the only river in contemporary Slovakia going north), and all colonists originated from [[Stary Sącz|Sądecczyzna]] and [[Podhale]] region of Southern [[Poland]].&lt;ref&gt;Marek Sobczyński, Kształtowanie się karpackich granic Polski (w X-XX w.), Łódź 1989&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Spisz, Orawa i Ziemia Czadecka : w świetle stosunków etnicznych i przeszłości dziejowej, Kraków 1939&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Terra Scepusiensis.

==Economy==
Economic activity in the region was principally based on agriculture (and, in the mediaeval period, mining).

'''Triangular trade''' or '''triangle trade''' is a historical term indicating trade among three ports or regions. Triangular trade usually evolves when a region has [[export]] commodities that are not required in the region from which its major [[import]]s come. Triangular trade thus provides a method for rectifying [[trade imbalance]]s between the above regions.

Historically the particular routes were also shaped by the powerful influence of [[winds in the Age of Sail|winds and currents]] during the [[age of sail]].  For example, from the main trading nations of Western Europe, it was much easier to sail westwards after first going ''south'' of [[30th parallel north|30 N latitude]] and reaching the so-called "[[trade winds]]"; thus arriving in the Caribbean rather than going straight west to the [[Northern America|North American mainland]]. Returning from North America, it is easiest to follow the [[Gulf Stream]] in a northeasterly direction using the [[westerlies]]. A similar triangle to this, called the ''[[volta do mar]]'' was already being used by the Portuguese, before [[Christopher Columbus]]' voyage, to sail to the [[Canary Islands]] and the [[Azores]]. Columbus simply expanded this triangle outwards, and his route became the main way for Europeans to reach, and return from, the Americas.

==Atlantic triangular slave trade==
{{Slavery}}
{{See also|Atlantic slave trade|Slave Coast of West Africa}}

The best-known triangular trading system is the transatlantic [[slave trade]], that operated from the late 16th to early 19th centuries, carrying slaves, cash crops, and manufactured goods between [[West Africa]],  [[Caribbean]] or [[Americas|America]]n colonies and the [[Europe]]an colonial powers, with the northern colonies of [[British North America]], especially [[New England]], sometimes taking over the role of Europe.&lt;ref&gt;[http://africanhistory.about.com/library/weekly/aa080601a.htm About.com: The Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade]. Accessed 6 November 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The use of African slaves was fundamental to growing colonial [[cash crop]]s, which were exported to Europe. European goods, in turn, were used to purchase African slaves, who were then brought on the [[sea lane]] west from Africa to the Americas, the so-called [[Middle Passage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Triangular Trade|url=http://www.nmm.ac.uk/freedom/viewTheme.cfm/theme/triangular|website=[[National Maritime Museum]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111125125048/http://www.nmm.ac.uk/freedom/viewTheme.cfm/theme/triangular|archivedate=25 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite being driven primarily by economic needs, Europeans sometimes had a religious justification for their actions. In 1452, for instance, [[Pope Nicholas V]], in the ''[[Dum Diversas]]'', granted to the kings of Spain and Portugal "full and free permission to invade, search out, capture, and subjugate the [[Saracens]] [Muslims] and pagans and any other unbelievers ... and to reduce their persons into perpetual slavery."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Change in Official Catholic Moral Teaching|last=Curran|first=Charles E.|publisher=Paulist Press|year=2003|location=Mahwah, New Jersey|pages=67}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Slaveshipposter.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Diagram illustrating the stowage of African slaves on a British [[slave ship]].]] 

A classic example is the [[colonial molasses trade]]. Merchants purchased raw [[sugar]] (often in its liquid form, [[molasses]]) from plantations in the Caribbean and shipped it to New England and Europe, where it was sold to distillery companies that produced rum. The profits from the sale of sugar were used to purchase rum, furs, and lumber in New England which merchants shipped to Europe.  With the profits from the European sales, merchants purchased Europe's manufactured goods, including tools and weapons.  Then the merchants shipped those manufactured goods, along with the American sugar and rum, to West Africa where they were bartered for slaves. The slaves were then brought back to the Caribbean to be sold to sugar planters. The profits from the sale of slaves in Brazil, the Caribbean islands, and the American South were then used to buy more sugar, restarting the cycle. The trip itself took five to twelve weeks.
[[File:Luxborough galley burnt nearly to the water, 25 June 1727.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The loss of the slaver ''[[Luxborough Galley]]'' in 1727  ("I.C. 1760"), lost in the last leg of the triangular trade, between the Caribbean and Britain.]]
[[File:North Atlantic Gyre.png|thumb|[[North Atlantic Gyre]]]]
The first leg of the triangle was from a European port to Africa, in which ships carried supplies for sale and trade, such as [[copper]], [[cloth]], trinkets, [[slave beads]], [[guns]] and [[ammunition]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ltscotland.org.uk/abolition/ Scotland and the Abolition of the Slave Trade] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120103172434/http://www.ltscotland.org.uk/abolition/ |date=2012-01-03 }}.  Accessed 28 March 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;  When the ship arrived, its cargo would be sold or bartered for slaves. On the second leg, ships made the journey of the [[Middle Passage]] from Africa to the [[New World]]. Many slaves died of disease in the crowded holds of the [[slave ship]]s. Once the ship reached the New World, enslaved survivors were sold in the Caribbean or the American colonies. The ships were then prepared to get them thoroughly cleaned, drained, and loaded with export goods for a return voyage, the third leg, to their home port,&lt;ref&gt;A. P. Middleton, ''Tobacco Coast''.&lt;/ref&gt; from the West Indies the main export cargoes were sugar, rum, and molasses; from [[Virginia]], [[tobacco]] and [[hemp]]. The ship then returned to Europe to complete the triangle.
[[File:Graph of the Number of Slaves Imported From Africa.png|thumb|248x248px|Graph depicting the number of slaves imported from Africa from 1501 to 1866]]
However, because of several disadvantages that slave ships faced compared to other trade ships, they often returned to their home port carrying whatever goods were readily available in the Americas and filled up a large part or all of their capacity with ballast. Other disadvantages include the different form of the ships (to carry as many humans as possible, but not ideal to carry a maximum amount of produce) and the variations in the duration of a slave voyage, making it practically impossible to pre-schedule appointments in the Americas, which meant that slave ships often arrived in the Americas out-of-season.  When the ships did reach their intended ports, only about 90% of the passengers survived the journey across the middle passage.  Due to the slaves being transported in tight, confined spaces, a significant percentage of the group that started perished on board or shortly after arrival due to disease and lack of nourishment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Death Toll From The Slave Trade|url=http://www.worldfuturefund.org/Reports/Slavedeathtoll/slaverydeathtoll.html|publisher=World Future Fund|accessdate=9 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source?|reason=|date=March 2018}} Cash crops were transported mainly by a separate fleet which only sailed from Europe to the Americas and back mitigating the impact the slaves involvement brought forth. The Triangular trade is a trade model, not an exact description of the ship's route.&lt;ref&gt;Emmer, P.C.: ''The Dutch in the Atlantic Economy, 1580–1880''. Trade, Slavery and Emancipation. Variorum Collected Studies Series CS614, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2017 study provides evidence for the hypothesis that the export of gunpowder technology to Africa increased the transatlantic slave trade by making it easier for Africans to enslave each other: "A one percent increase in gunpowder set in motion a 5-year gun-slave cycle that increased slave exports by an average of 50%, and the impact continued to grow over time."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Whatley |first=Warren C. |title=The Gun-Slave Hypothesis and the 18th Century British Slave Trade |journal=Explorations in Economic History |doi=10.1016/j.eeh.2017.07.001 |year=2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New England===
New England also made rum from Caribbean sugar and [[molasses]], which it shipped to Africa as well as within the [[New World]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.slavenorth.com/rhodeisland.htm Slavery in Rhode Island] Slavery in the North Accessed 11 September 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  Yet, the "triangle trade" as considered in relation to New England was a piecemeal operation. No New England traders are known to have completed a sequential circuit of the full triangle, which took a calendar year on average, according to historian Clifford Shipton.&lt;ref&gt;Curtis, Wayne. ''And a Bottle of Rum''. New York: Three Rivers Press, 2006–2007. {{ISBN|978-0-307-33862-4}}. page 117.&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of the New England Triangular trade was first suggested, inconclusively, in an 1866 book by George H. Moore, was picked up in 1872 by historian George C. Mason, and reached full consideration from a lecture in 1887 by American businessman and historian William B. Weeden.&lt;ref&gt;Curtis, Wayne. ''And a Bottle of Rum''. New York: Three Rivers Press, 2006–2007. {{ISBN|978-0-307-33862-4}}. p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt;
The song "Molasses to Rum" from the musical ''[[1776 (musical)|1776]]'' vividly describes this form of the triangular trade.

==Other triangular trades==
The term "triangular trade" also refers to a variety of other trades.
* A trade pattern which evolved before the [[American Revolutionary War]] between [[Great Britain]], the [[Thirteen Colonies|Colonies of British North America]], and British colonies in the Caribbean.  This typically involved exporting raw resources, such as [[fish]] (especially [[salt cod]]), agricultural produce or [[lumber]], from British North American colonies to slaves and planters in the [[West Indies]]; sugar and molasses from the Caribbean; and various manufactured commodities from Great Britain.&lt;ref&gt;[[Kurlansky, Mark]]. ''Cod: A Biography of the Fish That Changed the World''. New York: Walker, 1997. {{ISBN|0-8027-1326-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The shipment of [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] salt cod and [[grain|corn]] from [[Boston]] in British vessels to southern Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Morgan, Kenneth. ''Bristol and the Atlantic Trade in the Eighteenth Century''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1993. {{ISBN|0-521-33017-3}}. pp. 64–77.&lt;/ref&gt; This also included the shipment of wine and olive oil to Britain.
* A new "sugar triangle" developed in the 1820s and 1830s whereby American ships took local produce to [[Cuba]], then brought [[sugar]] or [[coffee]] from Cuba to the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] coast ([[Russian Empire]] and [[Sweden]]), then [[wrought iron|bar iron]] and [[hemp]] back to [[New England]].&lt;ref&gt;Chris Evans and Göran Rydén, ''Baltic Iron in the Atlantic World in the Eighteenth Century'' : Brill, 2007 {{ISBN|978-90-04-16153-5}}, 273.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Kubiyovych.jpg|thumb|150px|Volodymyr Kubiyovych]]

'''Volodymyr Mykhailovych Kubiyovych''', also spelled ''Kubiiovych'' or ''Kubijovyč'' ({{lang-uk|Володи́мир Миха́йлович Кубійо́вич}}; 23 September 1900, [[Nowy Sącz]], [[Austrian Galicia]] – 2 November 1985, [[Paris]], [[France]]) was a [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] geographer with a specialty in demography, a cartographer, an encyclopedist, politician, and statesman. Of mixed [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]] and [[Poles|Polish]] ethnic background, he was an important intellectual supporting the Ukrainian national movement in [[Second Polish Republic|inter-war Poland]], and his scholarly works from this period dealt with the Ukrainian ethnic presence in Poland, [[First Republic of Czechoslovakia|Czechoslovakia]], and [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]], and with the geographical boundaries of ethnographic Ukraine.

During [[World War II]] he headed the [[Cracow]]-based Ukrainian Central Committee which organized social and charitable work among Ukrainians in occupied Poland. Kubiyovych became a main proponent of the cooperation between certain Ukrainian Nationalist organizations and [[Nazi Germany]] with the ultimate goal of achieving an independent Ukrainian national state. After the war, he retired from political work but became one of the leading scholars of the Ukrainian [[diaspora]] in the West. After 1945, and throughout the [[Cold War]], Kubiyovych remained a target of vociferous criticism by the Soviet authorities, focusing on some of his wartime activities, in particular his sponsoring of the [[14th Waffen Grenadier Division of the SS Galizien (1st Ukrainian)|Ukrainian division]] of [[Waffen-SS]].

==Early life==

Kubiyovich was born in 1900 in [[Nowy Sącz]]; his father was an ethnic Ukrainian while his mother was an ethnic Pole, and he was baptized into the [[Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church]].  From 1918, Kubiyovych was educated at the [[Jagiellonian University]] in Cracow. After the collapse of [[Austria-Hungary]], he served in the ranks of the [[Ukrainian Galician Army]] which unsuccessfully [[Ukrainian-Polish War|fought the Poles]] for control of the eastern part of the former Austrian province of [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galicia]]. At the end of the Ukrainian-Polish war, he returned to his studies in geography at the Jagiellonian University. During the years 1928 to 1939, Kubiyovych taught at this institution as a lecturer ([[docent]]) but in 1939, was denied further tenure under [[Polonization#Second Polish Republic|political pressure from the Polish Ministry of War]]. In 1940, he was appointed professor of the [[Ukrainian Free University]] in [[Prague]] which managed to preserve a precarious existence in Nazi-occupied [[Czechoslovakia]]. From 1931, Kubiyovych had been a full member of the Galician-based [[Shevchenko Scientific Society]], which had with some difficulty carried on its scholarly work under  Polish rule; Kubiyovych headed its geography commission.

Before 1939, Kubiyovych's scholarly works concentrated on the geography and demography of the [[Carpathian Mountains]], especially the eastern Beskids, populated largely by the Ukrainian-speaking minority. At this time, he questioned official Polish statistics concerning the ethnic make-up of the [[Second Polish Republic|inter-war Polish Republic]] and maintained that the official numbers on Ukrainians were grossly understated. He was an editor and co-author of the pioneering Ukrainian-language ''Atlas of Ukraine and Adjacent Lands'' (1937) and the equally pioneering [[Ukrainian-language]] ''Geography of Ukraine and Neighbouring Lands'' (1938, 1943).

==Second World War==

During [[World War II]] he headed the [[Ukrainian Central Committee]] (UCC) in [[Cracow]] which was the officially recognized Ukrainian community and quasi-political organization under the Nazi occupation. It was responsible for [[social services]], veteran affairs, education, youth and economic activities. For example, after a flood and famine in Transcarpathia, the Committee was able to save and resettle 30,000 children.  By late 1943 it operated 1,366 kitchens and was able to feed 100,000 people.  When the Germans began to kill Ukrainian peasants in the Zamosc region for alleged resistance, Kubiyovych's protest to Hans Frank was able to halt that slaughter. The Committee was also able to build student residence housing for 7,000 students, provided scholarships worth 1.35 million zlotys, and organized over 100 youth groups, camps and sports clubs.&lt;ref&gt;Myroslav Yurkevich. (1986). Galician Ukrainians in German Military Formations and in the German Administration. In ''Ukraine during World War II: history and its aftermath : a symposium '' (Yuri Boshyk, Roman Waschuk, Andriy Wynnyckyj, Eds.). Edmonton: University of Alberta, Canadian Institute of Ukrainian Studies Press pg. 69&lt;/ref&gt;

After the Soviet-Nazi alliance ended in June 1941, Kubiyovych worked with the Germans in the creation of the "Galicia Division", [[14th Waffen Grenadier Division of the SS Galicia (1st Ukrainian)]] and took a leading role in its organization. The division was organized after the battle of Stalingrad as part of the German program of creating foreign formations of the [[Waffen-SS]] to fight on the Eastern Front against the [[Soviet Union]] and was to be commanded by German officers. These foreign units were formed mainly with volunteers recruited from nations that suffered enormously under the Soviet rule: Estonians, Latvians, Ukrainians, but also ethnic Russians (e.g. [[Russian Liberation Army|ROA]]). The proponent and formal organizer of the division was SS ''Brigadeführer'' [[Otto Wächter]], the Nazi governor of the newly created Galicia District and former governor of [[Cracow]]. The proposal was made to [[Himmler]] on March 1, 1943 and the division was publicly inaugurated on 28 April.&lt;ref&gt;Basil Dmytryshyn, "The Nazis and the SS Volunteer Division 'Galicia'", ''American Slavic and East European Review'', Vol. 15, No. 1. (Feb., 1956), pp. 3-6.&lt;/ref&gt; With the examples before him of the Polish and Ukrainian legions formed in Austria-Hungary during the [[First World War]], Kubiyovych was hoping to influence its essence and structure as the core of a future national army which would defend the interests of the Ukrainian people after the defeat of Germany and the chaos that was expected to ensue. However, the Germans would not allow the use of the name "Ukrainian" in the division's name and the end of the [[Second World War]] turned out to be quite different from what was expected.

During the war, on more than one occasion Kubiyovych protested to the German authorities against the rough treatment of the local Ukrainian population. Some of this material was later brought up as evidence at the famous [[Nuremberg Trials]] of Nazi war criminals.{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}}

Some Ukrainian sources claim that during the war Kubiyovych used his official position to ameliorate Ukrainian-Polish tensions in Galicia and in 1944 called for a halt to the fierce armed underground conflict between the two sides.&lt;ref name=dovidn&gt;Dovidnyk z istoriï Ukraïny, 3-Volumes, Article "[http://www.vesna.org.ua/txt/dov/istukr/IIk_6.html Kubiyovych Volodymyr]" (T. 2), Kiev, 1993-1999, {{ISBN|5-7707-5190-8}} (t. 1), {{ISBN|5-7707-8552-7}} (t. 2), {{ISBN|966-504-237-8}} (t. 3).&lt;/ref&gt; These sources also credit him with saving some three hundred people, "basically  Jews", from persecution by the Nazi authorities.&lt;ref name=dovidn/&gt;

==Emigration==

In 1944, Kubiyovych, moved to Germany where he at first settled in the American occupation zone in [[West Germany]], and then later moved to [[France]]. In Germany, he reorganized the [[Shevchenko Scientific Society]] as an [[émigré]] institution. He was its Secretary General from 1947 to 1963, and, from 1952, President of its European branch.

In exile, Kubiyovych became the chief editor of the Ukrainian-language ''Encyclopedia of  Ukrainian Studies'' (''Entsyklopediya ukrayinoznavstva'', ten volumes, 1949–84), the largest scholarly project undertaken by Ukrainian émigrés during the [[Cold War]]. While written largely reflecting Kubiyovych's own strong Ukrainophile views, his [[encyclopedia]], was meant to preserve Ukrainian national heritage which, at that time, was intentionally neglected and downgraded by the Soviet Russian-speaking regime in Ukraine. Kubiyovych's encyklopedia continues to be a valuable source of reference to this day.

Kubiyovych later became the chief editor of ''Ukraine: A Concise Encyclopædia'' published in two volumes (1963–71), an English translation of the thematic part of the ''Entsyklopediya ukrayinoznavstva''. A new revised and expanded English-language edition of the great ten-volume alphabetic part was published under the title ''Encyclopedia of Ukraine'' in [[Canada]] in the 1980s and 1990s, and was only completed after Kubiyovych's death. It is presently being put on-line.

During his exile in [[France]], Kubiyovych enjoyed considerable prestige as the most prominent Ukrainian scholar in the free world. He also enjoyed the respect of the influential Polish intellectual, [[Jerzy Giedroyć]], another resident of Paris, and who wrote in his autobiography that he thought that Kubiyovych had behaved honourably during the war ("Zachowal się świetnie"). In 1991, after Ukraine declared independence from the Soviets, scholars in Ukraine began reprinting Kubiyovych's major works, especially his encyclopedias, making them available to a wider readership in the home country for the first time.

In his later years, Kubiyovych published three volumes of memoirs describing his experiences in inter-war Poland, the Second World War, and émigré scholarly life in Germany and France during the [[Cold War]]. The most wide-ranging of these was the Ukrainian-language volume titled ''I am 85 Years Old'' (Paris-Munich, 1985).

Volodymyr Kubiyovych died on 2 November 1985 in [[Paris]].

==Modern legacy==
[[Image:Volodymyr Kubiyovych.jpg|thumb|Volodymyr Kubiyovych on a Ukrainian [[postal stationery]] item.]]

After the collapse of the [[Soviet Union]], the hostile Soviet propaganda line on Kubiyovych lost its official status, and was replaced by a nationalist line. His works, including his encyclopedias, were published in Ukraine where they are now in wide circulation. In 2000 a pre-stamped envelope was issued by the [[Ukrposhta|Ukrainian postal service]] honouring 100-year anniversary of Kubiyovych's birthday.
