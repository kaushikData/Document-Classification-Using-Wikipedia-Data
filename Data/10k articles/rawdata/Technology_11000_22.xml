'''AGRIS''' (International System for Agricultural Science and Technology) is a global public domain database with more than 8 million structured bibliographical records on agricultural science and technology. It became operational in 1975 and The database is maintained by [[CIARD]], and its content is provided by more than 150 participating institutions from 65 countries. The AGRIS Search system,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://agris.fao.org |title=agris.fao.org |publisher=agris.fao.org |date= |accessdate=2016-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; allows scientists, researchers and students to perform sophisticated searches using keywords from the [[AGROVOC]] thesaurus, specific journal titles or names of countries, institutions, and authors.

== Early AGRIS years ==
As [[information management]] flourished in the 1970s, the AGRIS [[metadata]] [[Text corpus|corpus]] was developed to allow its users to have free access to knowledge available in agricultural science and technology. AGRIS was developed to be an international cooperative system to serve both developed and [[developing countries]].

With the advent of the Internet, along with the promises offered by [[open access (publishing)|open access]] publishing, there was growing awareness that the management of agricultural science and technology information, would have various facets: [[Technical standard|standards]] and methodologies for [[interoperability]] and facilitation of knowledge exchange; tools to enable information management specialists to process data; information and knowledge exchange across countries. Common [[interoperability]] criteria were thus adopted in its implementation, and the AGRIS AP [[metadata]] was accordingly created in order to allow exchange and retrieval of Agricultural information Resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/008/ae909e/ae909e00.htm |title=The AGRIS Application Profile for the International Information System on Agricultural Sciences and Technology Guidelines on Best Practices for Information Object Description |publisher=Fao.org |date= |accessdate=2013-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== AGRIS 2.0 ==
AGRIS covers the wide range of subjects related to agriculture science and technology, including forestry, animal husbandry, aquatic sciences and fisheries, human nutrition, and extension. Its content includes unique grey literature such as unpublished scientific and technical reports, theses, conference papers, government publications, and more. A growing number (around 20%) of bibliographical records have a corresponding full text document on the web which can easily be retrieved by Google.

On 5 December 2013 AGRIS 2.0 was released. AGRIS 2.0 is at the same time:

# A collaborative network of more than 150 institutions from 65 countries, maintained by FAO of the UN, promoting free access to agricultural information.
# A multilingual bibliographic database for agricultural science, fuelled by the AGRIS network, containing more than 8 million records largely enhanced with AGROVOC, FAO’s multilingual thesaurus covering all areas of interest to FAO, including food, nutrition, agriculture, fisheries, forestry, environment etc.
# A mash-up web application that links the bibliographic AGRIS knowledge to related resources on the web using the [[Linked Open Data]] methodology. An AGRIS mashup page (e.g. http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=QM2008000025 ) is a web page where an AGRIS resource is displayed together with relevant knowledge extracted from external data sources (as the World Bank, DBPedia, and Nature). The availability of external data sources is not under AGRIS control. Thus, if an external data source is temporary unreachable, it won’t be displayed in AGRIS mashup pages.

Access to the AGRIS Repository is provided through the AGRIS Search Engine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://agris.fao.org/ |title=agris.fao.org |publisher=agris.fao.org |date= |accessdate=2013-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As such, it:
# enables retrieval of bibliographic records contained in the AGRIS Repository,
# allows users to perform either full-text or fielded, parametric and assisted queries.

AGRIS data was converted to RDF and the resulting linked dataset created some 200 million triples.
AGRIS is also registered in the Data Hub at http://thedatahub.org/dataset/agris{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}

The AGRIS partners contributing to the AGRIS Database use several formats for exchanging data, including simple DC, from [[OAI-PMH]] systems.
The AGRIS AP format is anyway adopted directly by:
# Open Archive Initiative (OAI) partners: Scielo, Viikki Science Library
# BIBSYS, Norway, National Library of Portugal, Wageningen UR Library.
# ''National networks'': NARIMS&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arc.sci.eg/ arc.sci.eg]&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Egypt]], [[PhilAgriNet]] in [[Philippines]], [[KAINet]] in [[Kenya]], NAC in [[Thailand]], GAINS in [[Ghana]].
# ''National institutional repositories'': Russia, Belarus, Uruguay, Spain, Iran.
# ''Information service providers'': [[Wolters Kluwer]], [[NISC]], CGIR, [[CGIAR]], [[Agriculture Network Information Center|AgNIC]], GFIS.
# ''Database systems/tools'': AgriOceanDspace,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aims.fao.org/agriocean-dspace |title=AgriOcean DSpace &amp;#124; Agricultural Information Management Standards (AIMS) |publisher=Aims.fao.org |date= |accessdate=2013-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; NewGenlib, WebAGRIS, NERAKIN, AgriDrupal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aims.fao.org/tools/agridrupal |title=AgriDrupal &amp;#124; Agricultural Information Management Standards (AIMS) |publisher=Aims.fao.org |date= |accessdate=2013-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== AGRIS under the CIARD umbrella ===
Falling under the umbrella of CIARD,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ciard.net |title=What is CIARD? &amp;#124; Coherence in Information for Agricultural Research for Development |publisher=Ciard.net |date= |accessdate=2013-07-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130725223232/http://www.ciard.net/ |archive-date=25 July 2013 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; a joint initiative co-led by the CGIAR,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rijsberman |first=Frank |url=http://www.cgiar.org |title=CGIAR Home |publisher=Cgiar.org |date=2013-07-04 |accessdate=2013-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; GFAR&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.egfar.org |title=EGFAR web Site |publisher=Egfar.org |date= |accessdate=2013-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[FAO]], the new AGRIS aims to promote the sharing and management of agricultural science and technology information through the use of common [[Technical standard|standards]] and methodologies. These will incorporate [[Web 2.0]] features, in order to make the search experience as comprehensive, intuitive and far-reaching as possible for users of the new AGRIS.

Furthermore, the new AGRIS will also leverage the data and infrastructure of one of CIARD's projects: the CIARD RING. An acronym standing for Routemap to Information Nodes and Gateways (RING), the CIARD RING project is led by [[Global Forum on Agricultural Research|GFAR]] and it aims to:

* give an overview of the current offer of information services in ARD; as well as
* support those who want to implement new services.

A directory of ARD (Agricultural Research for Development) information services will allow the monitoring, describing and classifying of existing services, whilst benchmarking them against [[interoperability]] criteria, to ensure for maximum outreach and global availability.

[[File:Ammonium nitrate-fuel oil (ANFO) explosive.jpg|thumb|300px|Ammonium nitrate prills used in ANFO at a [[potash|potash mine]].]]
[[File:Anfoa.jpg|thumb|300px|{{convert|25|kg|abbr=on}} sacks containing ANFO]]

'''ANFO''' (or '''AN/FO''', for '''ammonium nitrate/fuel oil''') is a widely used bulk industrial [[explosive]]. Its name is commonly pronounced as "an-fo".

It consists of 94% porous [[prill]]ed [[ammonium nitrate]] (NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) (AN), which acts as the oxidizing agent and absorbent for the fuel, and 6% number 2 [[fuel oil]] (FO).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Cook |first=Melvin A. |title=The Science of Industrial Explosives |publisher=IRECO Chemicals |year=1974 |page=1 |asin=B0000EGDJT}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ANFO has found wide use in [[coal mining]], [[quarrying]], metal [[mining]], and civil construction in applications where its low cost and ease of use may outweigh the benefits of other explosives, such as water resistance, oxygen balance, higher detonation velocity, or performance in small-diameter columns. ANFO is also widely used in avalanche hazard mitigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Cook |first=Melvin A. |title=The Science of Industrial Explosives |publisher=IRECO Chemicals |year=1974 |page=2 |asin=B0000EGDJT}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It accounts for an estimated 80% of the {{convert|6|e9lb|kg|abbr=on|order=flip}} of explosives used annually in North America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Edward M. Green|date=June 2006|title=Explosives regulation in the USA|url=http://www.crowell.com/documents/DOCASSOCFKTYPE_ARTICLES_408.pdf|journal=Industrial Materials|issue=465|page=78|accessdate=3 March 2013}}&lt;!--This isn't a peer-reviewed journal, but a trade journal; is {{cite journal}} correct?--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The press and other media have used the term ANFO loosely and imprecisely in describing [[improvised explosive device]]s (IEDs), in cases of '''fertilizer bombs''' (see [[#Malicious use|Malicious use]] below).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author = Jo Thomas |title = Jury to Be Picked in 2d Oklahoma Bomb Trial |work = [[The New York Times]] |date = 29 September 1997 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/09/29/us/jury-to-be-picked-in-2d-oklahoma-bomb-trial.html |accessdate=3 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of ANFO originated in the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/198577/explosive/82378/Ammonium-nitrate-fuel-oil-mixtures Encyclopædia Britannica]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chemistry==
The chemistry of ANFO detonation is the reaction of ammonium nitrate with a long-chain [[alkane]] (C&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2n+2&lt;/sub&gt;) to form [[nitrogen]], [[carbon dioxide]], and [[water]]. In an ideal [[stoichiometric]]ally balanced reaction, ANFO is composed of about 94.3% AN and 5.7% FO by weight. In practice, a slight excess of fuel oil is added, as underdosing results in reduced performance while overdosing merely results in more post-blast fumes.&lt;ref name="pothole" /&gt; When detonation conditions are optimal, the aforementioned gases are the only products. In practical use, such conditions are impossible to attain, and blasts produce moderate amounts of toxic gases such as [[carbon monoxide]] and [[nitrogen oxide]]s ([[NOx|NO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;]]).

The fuel component of ANFO is typically diesel, but [[kerosene]], coal dust, racing fuel, or even [[molasses]] have been used instead. Finely powdered aluminium in the mixture will sensitise it to detonate more readily.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Singh|first=R. D. |title=Principles and Practices of Modern Coal Mining|year=2005|publisher=New Age International|isbn=9788122409741|page=532}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ANFO is classified as a blasting agent, meaning that it decomposes through [[detonation]] rather than [[deflagration]] at a velocity higher than the speed of sound in the material but cannot be detonated with a No. 8 blasting cap without a sensitizer. ANFO has a moderate [[velocity of detonation|velocity]] compared to other industrial explosives, measuring 3,200&amp;nbsp;m/s in {{convert|5|in|mm| abbr=on|order=flip}} diameter, unconfined, at ambient temperature.

ANFO is a [[tertiary explosive]], meaning that it cannot be set off by the small quantity of primary explosive in a typical blasting cap. A larger quantity of secondary explosive, known as a primer or a [[explosive booster|booster]], must be used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |publisher=E. I. du Pont de Nemours &amp; Company |title=Blasters' Handbook 15th Edition |year=1969 |pages=64–68 |asin=B000JM3SD0}}&lt;/ref&gt; One or two sticks of [[dynamite]] were historically used; current practice is to use [[Tovex]] or [[cast booster]]s of [[pentolite]] (TNT/[[PETN]] or similar compositions).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/systems/munitions/explosives-anfo.htm |title=Explosives - ANFO (Ammonium Nitrate - Fuel Oil) |publisher=GlobalSecurity.org |accessdate=3 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Industrial use==
[[File:Charging with anfo.jpg|thumb|Charging a hole with ANFO for rock blasting]]

In the mining industry, the term ANFO specifically describes a mixture of solid ammonium nitrate prills and diesel fuel. Other explosives based on the ANFO chemistry exist; the most commonly used are [[emulsion]]s. They differ from ANFO in the physical form the reactants take. The most notable properties of emulsions are water resistance and higher bulk density.

While the density of pure crystalline ammonium nitrate is 1700&amp;nbsp;kg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, individual prills of explosive-grade AN measure approximately 1300&amp;nbsp;kg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. Their lower density is due to the presence of a small spherical air pocket within each prill: this is the primary difference between AN sold for blasting and that sold for agricultural use. These voids are necessary to sensitize ANFO: they create so-called "hot spots".&lt;ref&gt;It was found by the IRA, in response to using low-[[brisance]] AN fertilizers, that "hot spots" can be created by blending powdered sugar into the ANFO mixture, effectively sensitizing the mixture to mining-standard [[prilled]] ammonium nitrate effectiveness in which the interaction of the detonation front with a spherical void concentrates energy. Blasting-grade AN prills are typically between 0.9 and 3.0&amp;nbsp;mm in diameter.&lt;/ref&gt; Finely powdered [[aluminium]] can be added to ANFO to increase both sensitivity and energy; however, this has fallen out of favor due to cost.

ANFO has a [[bulk density]] of about 840&amp;nbsp;kg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. In surface mining applications, it is typically augured into boreholes by dedicated trucks that mix the AN and FO components immediately before the product is dispensed. In underground mining applications, ANFO is typically blow-loaded.

AN is highly [[hygroscopic]], readily absorbing water from air. In humid environments, absorbed water interferes with its explosive function.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} AN is fully water-soluble; as such, it cannot be loaded into boreholes that contain standing water. When used in wet mining conditions, considerable effort must be taken to remove standing water and install a liner in the borehole; it is generally more productive to instead use a water-resistant explosive such as emulsion.

==Regulatory treatment==
In most jurisdictions, ammonium nitrate need not be classified as an explosive for transport purposes; it is merely an [[oxidizer]]. Mines typically prepare ANFO on-site using the same [[diesel fuel]] that powers their vehicles. While many fuels can theoretically be used, the low volatility and cost of diesel make it ideal.

ANFO under most conditions is [[blasting cap]]–insensitive, so it is classified as a [[blasting agent]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Cook |first=Melvin A. |title=The Science of Industrial Explosives |publisher=IRECO Chemicals |year=1974 |page=16 |asin=B0000EGDJT}}&lt;/ref&gt; and not a [[high explosive]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owadisp.show_document?p_id=9755&amp;p_table=STANDARDS |title=Explosives and blasting agents |publisher=Occupation Safety &amp; Health Administration |accessdate= March 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ammonium nitrate is widely used as a [[fertilizer]] in the [[agricultural industry]]. It is also found in [[instant cold pack]]s. In many countries, its purchase and use are restricted to buyers who have obtained the proper license.

==In popular culture==
{{unreferenced section|date=October 2017}}
The Discovery Channel show ''[[MythBusters]]'' commonly used ANFO (with the help of detonation professionals), especially in [[MythBusters (2005 season)|episode 26: "Salsa Escape, Cement Removal"]] and [[MythBusters (2009 season)|episode 125: "Knock Your Socks Off"]] as well as the series finale when they not only blew up a recreational vehicle, but recreated the most iconic explosion in the show's history when they used 5,001 pounds of ANFO to blow up a cement truck.

It was used by [[Jim Caviezel]]'s character in the 2006 film ''[[Déjà Vu (2006 film)|Déjà Vu]]'' in a domestic terrorism attack.

In the book ''The Third Day, The Frost'' by [[John Marsden (writer)|John Marsden]], ANFO is used to blow up Cobblers Bay.

In a sub-plot of the book ''[[Executive Orders]]'' by [[Tom Clancy]], anarchists make a [[truck bomb]] filled with ANFO but are caught before reaching their target.

In the book ''[[Battle Royale (novel)|Battle Royale]]'' by [[Koshun Takami]], students who attempt to bomb a school use ANFO.

In the movie ''[[The Dark Knight (film)|The Dark Knight]]'' by [[Christopher Nolan]], [[The Joker (The Dark Knight)|The Joker]] uses the compound to hold two ferries hostage, and tries to make the people on each ferry detonate the other ferry.

In [[Stephen King]]'s novel ''[[Desperation (novel)|Desperation]]'', novelist Johnny Marinville prevents the rest of the group from going forward, and proceeds to blow up the Pit and the ''ini'' inside with the ANFO, sacrificing himself.

It is often mentioned and used by the protagonist Vic in ''[[NOS4A2]]'' by [[Joe Hill (writer)|Joe Hill]].

==Disasters==
{{main|Ammonium nitrate disasters}}
Unmixed ammonium nitrate can decompose explosively and has been responsible for several industrial disasters, including the 1922 [[Oppau explosion]] in Germany, the 1947 [[Texas City disaster]] in [[Texas City, Texas]], the 2004 [[Ryongchon disaster]] in [[North Korea]], and the 2013 [[West Fertilizer Company explosion]] in [[West, Texas]]. Environmental hazards include [[eutrophication]] in confined waters and nitrate/gas oil contamination of ground or surface water.&lt;ref&gt;P. Cosgrove. Ammogex Material Safety Data Sheet, Document No: HS-MSDS-03, [[Irish Industrial Explosives Ltd]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Malicious use==
ANFO was first used maliciously in 1970 when protests by students became violent at the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]], who learned how to make and use ANFO from a Wisconsin Conservation Department booklet entitled ''Pothole Blasting for Wildlife'',&lt;ref name="pothole"&gt;{{cite book |author=Mathiak, Harold A. |title=Pothole Blasting for Wildlife |page=11 |publisher=Wisconsin Conservation Department, Madison, Wisconsin 53701 |year=1965}}&lt;!--Not in LOC catalog--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Mike Davis |title=Buda's Wagon: A Brief History of the Car Bomb |publisher=Verso |location=New York |year=2007 |page=53 |lccn=2007274127 |isbn=1844671321}}.&lt;/ref&gt; resulting in the [[Sterling Hall bombing]].

ANFO used to be widely used by the FLNC ([[National Liberation Front of Corsica]]) in Corsica, along with f15 explosive, in order to fight against French colonists and symbols. Five containers of 500 kilos each were used to blow up the Tax Office building in Bastia on 28 February 1987.

The ANFO [[car bomb]] was adopted by the [[Provisional IRA]] in 1972 and, by 1973, [[the Troubles]] were consuming 47,000&amp;nbsp;lb of ammonium nitrate for the majority of bombs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Henry Stanhope |title=The will to blow the lid off Ulster still remains strong |newspaper=The Times |location=London |&lt;!--url: Archive starts in 2000--&gt; |date=8 November 1974}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Ulster Volunteer Force]] (UVF) also made use of ANFO bombs, often mixing in [[gelignite]] as a booster.&lt;ref&gt;https://balaclavastreet.wordpress.com/tag/bombs/&lt;/ref&gt; The IRA [[Bishopsgate bombing|detonated an ANFO truck bomb on Bishopsgate]] in London in 1993, killing one and causing £350 million in damage. It has also seen use by groups such as the [[Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia]] and [[ETA (separatist group)|ETA]]. In 1992, [[Shining Path]] perpetrated the [[Tarata bombing]] in [[Lima, Peru]], using two ANFO truck bombs.

A more sophisticated variant of ANFO (ammonium nitrate with [[nitromethane]] as the fuel, called ANNM) was used in the 1995 [[Oklahoma City bombing]].

The [[Shijiazhuang bombings]] (Chinese: 靳如超爆炸案 or 石家庄"3·16"特大爆炸案) rocked the city of Shijiazhuang, China, on 16 March 2001. A total of 108 people were killed, and 38 others injured when, within a short time, several ANFO bombs exploded near four apartment buildings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=3 April 2001 |title=石家庄九名制贩爆炸物的嫌犯被刑事拘留 |trans-title=Shijiazhuang nine suspects of the sale of explosives were detained in criminal detention |url=http://news.sina.com.cn/c/222078.html&amp;usg=ALkJrhgOJfTK3ZhEpPY9V8vwNL_TK_SjRA |language=Chinese |location=Beijing |access-date=12 August 2017 }}{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Improvised bombs made with agricultural-grade AN are less sensitive and less efficient than the explosive-grade variety. In November 2009, a ban on [[ammonium sulfate]], ammonium nitrate, and [[calcium ammonium nitrate]] fertilizers was imposed in the former [[Malakand Division]] – comprising the [[Upper Dir]], [[Lower Dir]], [[Swat, Pakistan|Swat]], [[Chitral]] and [[Malakand District|Malakand]] districts of the [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa|North West Frontier Province]] (NWFP) of [[Pakistan]] – by the NWFP government, following reports that those chemicals were used by militants to make explosives.

In April 2010, police in Greece confiscated 180&amp;nbsp;kg of ANFO and other related material stashed in a hideaway in the Athens suburb of Kareas. The material was believed to be linked to attacks previously carried out by the "Revolutionary Struggle" terrorist group.

In January 2010, President [[Hamid Karzai]] of [[Afghanistan]] also issued a decree banning the use, production, storage, purchase, or sale of ammonium nitrate, after an investigation showed militants in the [[Taliban insurgency]] had used the substance in bomb attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesunion.com/ASPStories/story.asp?StoryID=720948 |newspaper=Times Union |location=Albany, N.Y. |title=Afghanistan bans chemical used to make bombs; protesters denounce killings |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100607130249/http://www.timesunion.com/AspStories/story.asp?storyID=720948 |archivedate=7 June 2010 }}&lt;!--There are several different stories on archive.org matching this URL but none of them have anything close to this title--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/feedarticle/8910984 |agency=AP Foreign |date=22 January 2010 |newspaper=The Guardian | title=Afghanistan bans chemical used to make bombs |accessdate=3 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Dexter Filkins |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/11/world/asia/11afghan.html |title=Bomb Material Cache Uncovered in Afghanistan |newspaper=The New York Times |date=11 November 2009 |access-date=3 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 22 July 2011, an aluminium powder-enriched ANNM explosive, with total size of 950&amp;nbsp;kg (150&amp;nbsp;kg of aluminium powder), increasing demolition power by 10–30% over plain ANFO, was used in the [[2011 Norway attacks|Oslo bombing]].&lt;ref name=nrk950kg&gt;{{cite news |author=Stina Åshildsdatter Grolid |author2=Unni Eikeseth |url=http://www.nrk.no/nyheter/1.7726208 | title=Slik virket trykkbølgen etter bomben |language=Norwegian |trans-title=Such seemed the shock wave after the bomb |date=25 July 2011| publisher = NRK| access-date=28 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-07-27/norway-police-spreads-breivik-terror-probe-europe-wide-after-twin-attacks.html | work=Bloomberg | first1=Marianne | last1=Stigset | first2=Josiane | last2=Kremer | first3=Stephen | last3=Treloar | title=Police in Norway Extend Terror Probe Across Europe After Breivik Attacks | date=27 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 13 April 2016, two suspected [[Irish Republican Army|IRA]] members were stopped in Dublin with 67&amp;nbsp;kg of ANFO.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Daniel Hickey |title=Two men appear in court charged with possession of 150kg of homemade explosives |newspaper=Irish Independent |location=Dublin|url=http://www.independent.ie/irish-news/courts/two-men-appear-in-court-charged-with-possession-of-150kg-of-homemade-explosives-34631186.html|access-date=16 April 2016 |date=13 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 6 March 2018, 8 members of the extreme right [[Neo-Nazism|neo-Nazi]] group «[[Combat 18]] Hellas» arrested in Athens, Greece accused for multiple attacks on immigrants and activists with 50&amp;nbsp;kg of ANFO in their possession.&lt;ref&gt;http://news247.gr/eidiseis/koinonia/o-tsamp-ths-combat-18-kai-o-lukos-ths-xryshs-ayghs-epivevaiwnoyn-th-logikh-twn-sygkoinwnountwn-doxeiwn.5111561.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==ANNM==
Ammonium nitrate and [[nitromethane]] (ANNM) is one of the most powerful improvised types of AN-based explosives. The [[relative effectiveness factor]] of ANNM varies depending on the mix, but does not exceed 1.0 (ANNM+AL = R.E.F. of 1.0–1.1). ANNM usually contains a 60:40 (kinepak) mix of AN and NM (60% ammonium nitrate, 40% nitromethane by mass), though this results in a wet slurry. Sometimes, more AN is added to reduce liquidity and make it easier to store and handle, as well as providing an oxygen-balanced mix. ANNM is also more sensitive to shock than standard ANFO and is therefore easier to detonate. When ANNM [[detonate]]s, the primary products are H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, but NO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; and other toxic gases are inevitably formed because of a negative oxygen balance. The balanced equation is as follows:

3NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + 2CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; -&gt; 4N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 2CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 9H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

Depending on the detonation impetus (for example a #6 versus a #10 [[detonator]]), the products of the detonation can be decidedly [[stoichiometric|unstoichiometric]].

'''Muhammad Ahmad Abbud Pasha''' ({{Lang-ar|محمد أحمد عبود باشا}}) (1899–1963) was an [[Egypt]]ian [[entrepreneur]] and [[business magnate]].

Abbud established a construction firm in the early 1920s, which went on to become the most successful business group in Egypt of that era. By the 1940s, he owned the Sugar Company, the Khedival Mail Line as well as the Egyptian General Omnibus Company. In addition, he was the largest shareholder of [[Banque Misr]], and obtained a seat on its board of directors in 1950. In the same year, he became the first Egyptian director of the [[Suez Canal Company]], which was then owned by foreigners.

Abbud received the noble title of ''[[Pasha]]'' on 14 February 1931.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=List of Pashas 1915–52 |url=http://www.egy.com/historica/pashalst.htm |publisher=Egy.com |accessdate=2009-04-10 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090505083109/http://www.egy.com/historica/pashalst.htm |archivedate=5 May 2009 |deadurl=yes |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt; He was also active in politics. He became a parliamentary deputy in 1926, representing the [[Wafd Party]] which he supported financially until [[Mustafa el-Nahhas]] became its leader in 1927. Abbud later reconciled with the party and started supporting it once again during its final years in power, and was close to party strongman [[Fuad Siraj al-Din]].

Abbud Pasha died in [[London]] in 1963, and was reported to be among the ten richest men in the world at the time of his death.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3531">'''Acetogenesis''' is a process through which [[acetate]] is produced from CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and an [[electron donor|electron source]] (e.g., [[Hydrogen|H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[Carbon monoxide|CO]], [[formate]], etc.) by [[anaerobic bacteria]] via the reductive acetyl-CoA or [[Wood-Ljungdahl pathway]]. The different bacterial species that are capable of acetogenesis are collectively termed [[acetogen]]s. Some acetogens can synthesize acetate autotrophically from carbon dioxide and hydrogen gas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Singleton | first1 = Paul | name-list-format = vanc | title = Dictionary of microbiology and molecular biology | date = 2006 | publisher = John Wiley | location = Chichester | isbn = 978-0-470-03545-0 | edition = 3rd | chapter = Acetogenesis }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Discovery == 
In 1932, organisms were discovered that could convert hydrogen gas and carbon dioxide into [[acetic acid]]. The first acetogenic bacterium species, '' [[Clostridium aceticum]]'', was discovered in 1936 by Klaas Tammo Wieringa. A second species, ''[[Moorella thermoacetica]]'', attracted wide interest when it was first isolated because of its ability to convert glucose into three moles of acetic acid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ragsdale SW, Pierce E | title = Acetogenesis and the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway of CO(2) fixation | journal = Biochimica et Biophysica Acta | volume = 1784 | issue = 12 | pages = 1873–98 | date = December 2008 | pmid = 18801467 | pmc = 2646786 | doi = 10.1016/j.bbapap.2008.08.012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biochemistry==
The precursor to acetic acid is the [[thioester]] [[acetyl CoA]]. The key aspects of the acetogenic pathway are several reactions that include the reduction of [[carbon dioxide]] to [[carbon monoxide]] and the attachment of the carbon monoxide to a [[methyl group]]. The first process is catalyzed by enzymes called [[carbon monoxide dehydrogenase]]. The coupling of the methyl group (provided by [[methylcobalamin]]) and the CO is catalyzed by acetyl CoA synthetase.&lt;ref name="pmid16895330"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ragsdale SW | title = Metals and their scaffolds to promote difficult enzymatic reactions | journal = Chemical Reviews | volume = 106 | issue = 8 | pages = 3317–37 | date = August 2006 | pmid = 16895330 | doi = 10.1021/cr0503153 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  
:2 CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 4 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  →  CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;COOH + 2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

==Applications== 
The unique metabolism of acetogens has significance in biotechnological uses. In carbohydrate fermentations, the decarboxylation reactions involved result in the loss of carbon into [[carbon dioxide]]. This loss is an issue with an increased requirement of minimization of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions, as well as successful competition for fossil fuels with biofuel production being limited by monetary value. Acetogens can ferment glucose without any CO &lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  emissions and convert it to 3 acetates, which can theoretically increase product yield by 50%. Acetogeneis does not replace glycolysis with a different pathway, but is rather used by capturing CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; from glycolysis and placing it through acetogenesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Schuchmann K, Müller V | title = Energetics and Application of Heterotrophy in Acetogenic Bacteria | journal = Applied and Environmental Microbiology | volume = 82 | issue = 14 | pages = 4056–69 | date = July 2016 | pmid = 27208103 | doi = 10.1128/AEM.00882-16 | pmc = 4959221 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4829">'''All-Star Orchestra''' is an [[orchestral music]] project created by [[Gerard Schwarz]], former [[music director]] and [[laureate|conductor laureate]] of [[Seattle Symphony]]. It is a television and DVD project, filmed by 18 [[high-definition video|high definition video cameras]] without an audience for [[PBS]], the [[Khan Academy]], educators, students, "and enthusiasts."  Mr Schwarz assembled 95 leading orchestral musicians, of major [[symphony orchestra]]s, from across the United States. The assembled players performed over a four-day period. In 2014, the program consisted of eight episodes. The second season began broadcast in the fall of 2015. The organization's web site provides detail of the second season's programs.

The first part of the program consists of [[Igor Stravinsky|Stravinsky]]'s ''[[The Firebird]]'', [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]]'s [[Symphony No. 5 (Beethoven)|Fifth Symphony]], [[Maurice Ravel|Ravel]]'s ''[[Daphnis et Chloé]]'' Suite No. 2, [[Dmitri Shostakovich|Shostakovich]]'s [[Symphony No. 5 (Shostakovich)|Symphony No. 5]] and [[Johannes Brahms|Brahms]]'s [[Six Pieces for Piano, Op. 118 (Brahms)|Intermezzo in A]].&lt;ref name=wakin&gt;

'''Analytic applications''' are a type of business [[application software]], used to measure and improve the performance of business operations. More specifically, analytic applications are a type of [[business intelligence]]. As such they use collections of historical data about business operations to provide business users with information and tools that allow them to make improvements in business functions.

The maturity levels for business intelligence are:
* [[operational reporting]]
* analytic reporting
* [[dashboards (management information systems)|business dashboards]]
* analytic applications

It may extend further to predictive analytics, or predictive analysis may form part of the analytic application - depending on both the subject matter under analysis, and the nature of the analysis required. 

Analytic applications are typically described as a subset of performance management. They specifically relate to the analysis of a business process (such as sales pipeline analysis, accounts payable analytics, or risk adjusted profitability analysis) in support of decision making.

To qualify as an application (rather than simply as a data warehousing tool), these tools should promote some form of automation. The maturity level of this automation is as follows:
* reading data from a nominated operational system (ERP, CRM, SCM, etc.) into a data warehouse optimized for analysis (data led automation),
* reports, dashboards and scorecards based on that data structure (reporting led automation),
* what-if analysis and scenario-modeling (predictive or analytic led automation).
In most cases, these three levels are discrete functions, loosely banded together as a single product, and there is little automation of the process from end to end.

==History of atmospheric mining==
Atmospheric mining of [[outer planets]] has not yet begun. There is some consensus that gas should be mined from gas planets, but this would be difficult with current technology; however Uranus &amp; Neptune would be the easiest planets to mine for gas. Jupiter &amp; Saturn are closer, but Jupiter has a lot of gravity to contend with, and it could be difficult navigating through the rings of Saturn. Also, Earth's atmosphere can be mined for carbon dioxide to produce fuel and to reduce the levels of greenhouse gas in the atmosphere.

==Types of atmospheric mining==
===Hydrogen mining===

[[Hydrogen]] may fuel chemical and [[nuclear propulsion]].&lt;ref name="NASA"/&gt;

===Helium mining===

[[Helium]]-[[Helium-3|3]] may fuel nuclear propulsion.&lt;ref name="NASA"/&gt;

===Methane mining===

[[Methane]] may fuel chemical propulsion.&lt;ref name="NASA"/&gt;

===Carbon dioxide mining===

[[Carbon dioxide]] mining on earth will reduce the level of greenhouse gases &amp; can also produce fuel.

==Exploration for atmospheric mining==
Hydrogen and helium are abundant in outer planets.

The '''Australian International Design Awards''' is an industry body established by the [[Industrial Design Council of Australia]] (IDCA), founded in 1958. The awards are [[Australia|Australia's]] only national design awards for [[industrial design]]. Since 1991, the Australian International Design Awards has been a division of [[Standards Australia]].

In 2007 the Australian Design Awards expanded its entry criteria to include all professionally designed products on the Australian market, including products designed in Australia. From 2007, the Australian Design Awards became known as the Australian International Design Awards to reflect the global nature of the awards.

The Australian International Design Awards has been recognised by the [[Government of Australia|Commonwealth Government]] and the International Council of Societies of Industrial Design&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icsid.org ICSID] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090906041307/http://www.icsid.org/ |date=6 September 2009 }}.org&lt;/ref&gt; as a promotional body for the Australian design industry.

== Awards ==
There are three types of accolades issued by the Australian International Design Awards,&lt;ref&gt;[http://designawards.com.au/accolades.jsp Designawards.com.au] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090912113443/http://designawards.com.au/accolades.jsp |date=12 September 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; they are:
* Australian International Design Mark (recognising Good Design)
* Australian International Design Award (recognising Design Excellence)
* Australian International Design Award of the Year (recognising the best product of the year)

Special Awards include:
* Award for Excellence in Sustainable Design&lt;ref&gt;[http://designawards.com.au/sustainable_design.jsp Sustainable design] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090912140502/http://designawards.com.au/sustainable_design.jsp |date=12 September 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Powerhouse Museum Design Award and Selection&lt;ref&gt;[http://designawards.com.au/powerhouse_museum_selection.jsp Powerhouse museum selection] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090912124235/http://designawards.com.au/powerhouse_museum_selection.jsp |date=12 September 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Wheels Automotive Design Award&lt;ref&gt;[http://designawards.com.au/wheels.jsp Wheels] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090912140422/http://designawards.com.au/wheels.jsp |date=12 September 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
{{refimprove section|date=April 2013}}
In 1958 the Industrial Design Council of Australia (IDCA) was established&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.powerhousemuseum.com/collection/database/?irn=362218|title=Industrial Design Council of Australia Archive|website=www.powerhousemuseum.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  funded by the Commonwealth Government. The goal was to educate [[Manufacturer|manufacturers]] and consumers on the value of design, encourage and promote high standards of design in [[Manufacturing|manufactured]] goods.

From 1964 Good Design Labels began to appear on products and the Australian Design Index became a register of the best designed products in Australia. A panel of experts reviewed items for inclusion in the Index. Products meeting the criteria received the Good Design Label and other manufacturers were given constructive criticism on how to improve their products.

In 1964, the IDCA opened the first Australian Design Centre in [[Melbourne]] with a special exhibition of selected products from the Australian Design Index. Federal and state government funding helped establish a new Design Centre in [[Sydney]], with more centres to follow in other cities. 

In 1967 the Prince Philip Prize for Australian Design was set up, supported by [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh]], with the aim of promoting greater awareness of good design in Australian [[engineering]]. The inaugural Prince Philip Prize was awarded in 1968.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wong|first1=Ian|title=Prince Philip Prize - STILL Winners|url=http://ianwongresearch.blogspot.com.au/2011/10/prince-phillip-design-prize-still.html|website=Industrial Design in Victoria|accessdate=10 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over 90 entries were received and the winning entry was a self-propelled grain header, designed by Kenneth Gibson. The Prince Philip Prize continued for twenty years.

The IDCA faced funding difficulties in the mid-1970s and was forced to close temporarily in 1976. A new funding injection from the Commonwealth Government helped the Council reopen and a new 'innovation' recognition program was introduced.

Recognising not only high quality but innovative Australian designed products, the Australian Design Award (ADA) program became a valuable promotional tool for manufacturers and designers and provided a source of revenue for the IDCA to continue its operations. The Prince Philip Prize continued to be awarded, but only to products which had received the ADA.

During this time, publicity was at an all-time high. Televised coverage of the Awards presentation on [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC TV]] reached audiences of over four million and in 1979, the first annual yearbook of ADA winners was published. 

For the next two decades, however, continuing funding issues, dwindling industry support and a lack of clear direction plagued the IDCA. In 1987 in an effort to reinvigorate the movement, the government re-launched the IDCA as the Australian Design Council and the Prince Philip Prize was folded, leaving the ADA as Australia's top design accolade.

In 1991, control of the Australian Design Council and the ADA program moved to [[Standards Australia]]. Under Standards Australia, the ADA program continued to run, but the Australian Design Council was disbanded in 1993. New formats and incentives for the ADA program such as the Australian Design Mark certification scheme were trialled during the second half of the '90s without success. In 1997 a revamped format was introduced to the Awards, using an online application form and first round internet shortlisting. It attracted more than one hundred applications. The first Presentation Night was held at the [[The Metro Theatre|Metro Theatre]] in Sydney. In 1998, profession-based categories were introduced.

However, the program was threatened by significant [[operating costs]]. The 1999 program was put on hold while Standards Australia explored other options to secure the future of the awards. The majority of staff was made redundant and for the first time in many years, no Design Awards were presented in Australia. The Design Institute of Australia was approached to take over the program but the financial commitment to posed too great a risk. 

Armed with a new business plan and financial model, the Board of Standards Australia approved another year for the awards. For the next few years, the ADA continued to grow in standing and support, buoyed by financial stability. A student design category was launched in 2002 supported by [[Dyson (company)|Dyson Appliances]] Australia and in 2004, product-focused categories were introduced.

In 2008, on the 50th anniversary of rewarding design and innovation excellence in Australia, internationally designed products available for sale in Australia were allowed to enter the awards for the first time. This bold move was aimed at raising the stakes for good design once again, allowing Australian design to be benchmarked against the best in the world. With the ongoing support of the design industry and Standards Australia, this opens the door to the next chapter in the history of the Design Awards.&lt;ref&gt;[http://designawards.com.au/retrospective.jsp 50 Year Retrospective of the Australian International Design Awards 1958–2008] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091003130032/http://designawards.com.au/retrospective.jsp |date=3 October 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wilson|publisher=Newnes|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Capacitive displacement sensors are used in a wide variety of applications including [[semiconductor]] processing, assembly of precision equipment such as [[disk drive]]s, precision thickness measurements, [[machine tool]] [[metrology]] and [[assembly line]] testing. These types of sensors can be found in [[machining]] and [[manufacturing]] facilities around the world.

[[File:Pepperl+Fuchs capacitive sensor CJ8-18GM-E2-V1.jpg|thumb|Industrial capacitive sensor]]

==Basic capacitive theory==
[[Capacitance]] is an electrical property which is created by applying an [[electrical charge]] to two conductive objects with a gap between them. A simple demonstration is two parallel conductive plates of the same profile with a gap between them and a charge applied to them. In this situation, the Capacitance can be expressed by the [[equation]]:
:&lt;math&gt; C = \dfrac{\varepsilon_0 K A}{d} &lt;/math&gt; &lt;ref name="Physics"&gt;{{cite book|isbn=0-87901-135-1|title=Physics Second Edition|author=Paul Allen Tipler|pages=653–660|publisher=Worth Publishers|year=1982}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Where ''C'' is the capacitance, ε&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[permittivity of free space]] constant, ''K'' is the [[dielectric constant]] of the material in the gap, ''A'' is the area of the plates, and ''d'' is the distance between the plates.

There are two general types of capacitive displacement sensing systems. One type is used to measure thicknesses of conductive materials. The other type measures thicknesses of non conductive materials or the level of a fluid.

A capacitive sensing system for conductive materials uses a model similar to the one described above, but in place of one of the conductive plates, is the [[sensor]], and in place of the other, is the conductive target to be measured.  Since the area of the probe and target remain constant, and the [[dielectric]] of the material in the gap (usually air) also remains constant, "any change in capacitance is a result of a change in the distance between the probe and the target." &lt;ref name="LionCapTheory"&gt;[http://www.lionprecision.com/tech-library/technotes/cap-0020-sensor-theory.html Capacitive Sensor Operation and Optimization How Capacitive Sensors Work and How to Use Them Effectively], An in depth discussion of capacitive sensor theory from Lion Precision.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the equation above can be simplified to:
:&lt;math&gt;C \propto \dfrac{1}{d} &lt;/math&gt;
Where α indicates a proportional relationship.
Due to this proportional relationship, a capacitive sensing system is able to measure changes in capacitance and translate these changes into distance measurements.

The operation of the sensor for measuring thickness of non-conductive materials can be thought of as two capacitors in series, with each having a different dielectric (and dielectric constant). The sum of the thicknesses of the two dielectric materials remains constant but the thickness of each can vary. The thickness of the material to be measured displaces the other dielectric.  The gap is often an air gap, (dielectric constant = 1) and the material has a higher dielectric. As the material gets thicker, the capacitance increases and is sensed by the system.

A sensor for measuring fluid levels works as two capacitors in parallel with constant total area. Again the difference in the dielectric constant of the fluid and the dielectric constant of air results in detectable changes in the capacitance between the conductive probes or plates.

==Applications==

===Precision positioning===
One of the more common applications of capacitive sensors is for precision positioning. Capacitive displacement sensors can be used to measure the position of objects down to the [[nanometer]] level. This type of precise positioning is used in the semiconductor industry where [[silicon wafer]]s need to be positioned for exposure. Capacitive sensors are also used to pre-focus the [[electron microscope]]s used in testing and examining the wafers.

===Disc drive industry===
In the disc drive industry, capacitive displacement sensors are used to measure the runout (a measure of how much the axis of rotation deviates from an ideal fixed line) of disc drive [[Hard disk drive#Spindle|spindle]]s. By knowing the exact runout of these spindles, disc drive manufacturers are able to determine the maximum amount of data that can be placed onto the drives. Capacitive sensors are also used to ensure that disc drive platters are [[orthogonal]] to the spindle before data is written to them.

===Precision thickness measurements===
Capacitive displacement sensors can be used to make very precise thickness measurements. Capacitive displacement sensors operate by measuring changes in position. If the position of a reference part of known thickness is measured, other parts can be subsequently measured and the differences in position can be used to determine the thickness of these parts.&lt;ref name="LionCapThickness"&gt;[http://www.lionprecision.com/tech-library/appnotes/app-flash/f-cap-0030-thickness.html Capacitive Thickness Measurements], A tutorial on capacitive thickness measurements.&lt;/ref&gt; In order for this to be effective using a single probe, the parts must be completely flat and measured on a perfectly flat surface. If the part to be measured has any [[curvature]] or [[deformity]], or simply does not rest firmly against the flat surface, the distance between the part to be measured and the surface it is placed upon will be erroneously included in the thickness measurement. This error can be eliminated by using two capacitive sensors to measure a single part. Capacitive sensors are placed on either side of the part to be measured. By measuring the parts from both sides, curvature and deformities are taken into account in the [[measurement]] and their effects are not included in the thickness readings.

The thickness of plastic materials can be measured with the material placed between two electrodes a set distance apart. These form a type of capacitor. The plastic when placed between the electrodes acts as a dielectric and displaces air (which has [[dielectric constant]] of 1, different from the plastic). Consequently the capacitance between the electrodes changes. The capacitance changes can then be measured and correlated with the material's thickness.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lionprecision.com/tech-library/appnotes/dual-0010-film-thick.html Film thickness gauge]&lt;/ref&gt;

Capacitive sensors circuits can be constructed that are able to detect changes in capacitance on the order of a 10&lt;sup&gt;−5&lt;/sup&gt; [[Farad|picofarads]] (10 attofarads).

===Non-conductive targets===
While capacitive displacement sensors are most often used to sense changes in position of conductive targets, they can also be used to sense the thickness and/or density of non-conductive targets as well.&lt;ref name="LionCapTheory"/&gt; A non-conductive object placed in between the probe and conductive target will have a different dielectric constant than the air in the gap and will therefore change the Capacitance between probe and target. (See the first equation above) By analyzing this change in capacitance, the thickness and density of the non-conductor can be determined.

===Machine tool metrology===
Capacitive displacement sensors are often used in metrology applications. In many cases, sensors are used “to measure shape errors in the part being produced. But they also can measure the errors arising in the equipment used to manufacture the part, a practice known as machine tool metrology”.&lt;ref name="LLNL"&gt;[https://www.llnl.gov/str/Blaedel.html Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory: Engineering Precision into Laboratory Projects], Examples of advances made by LLNL in the field of precision measurement.&lt;/ref&gt; In many cases, the sensors are used to analyze and optimize the rotation of spindles in various machine tools, examples include [[surface grinder]]s, [[lathe]]s, [[milling machine]]s, and [[air bearing]] spindles.&lt;ref name="PrecisionSpindleMetrology"&gt;{{cite book|isbn=1-60595-003-3|title=Precision Spindle Metrology|author=Eric R. Marsh|publisher=Destech Pubns Inc|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; By measuring errors in the machines themselves, rather than simply measuring errors in the final products, problems can be dealt with and fixed earlier in the manufacturing process.

===Assembly line testing===
Capacitive displacement sensors are often used in assembly line testing. Sometimes they are used to test assembled parts for uniformity, thickness or other design features. At other times, they are used to simply look for the presence or absence of a certain component, such as [[glue]].&lt;ref name="LionGlue"&gt;[http://www.lionprecision.com/tech-library/appnotes/app-flash/f-cap-0040-glue.html Sensing Glue on Paper], A tutorial on using capacitive sensors for glue sensing.&lt;/ref&gt; Using capacitive sensors to test assembly line parts can help to prevent quality concerns further along in the production process.

==Comparison to eddy current displacement sensors==
Capacitive displacement sensors share many similarities to [[eddy current]] (or inductive) displacement sensors; however capacitive sensors use an [[electric field]] as opposed to the [[magnetic field]] used by eddy current sensors &lt;ref name="CapVEddy"&gt;[http://www.lionprecision.com/tech-library/technotes/tech-flash/cve/f-article-0011-cve.html Lion Precision Capacitive Eddy Current Comparison], A comparison between capacitive and eddy current sensing technology from Lion Precision.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Siemens"&gt;[http://www.tech-pedia.com/Electrical_Engineering/Circuit%20Components/proximity%20sensors/capacitive/snrs_3.pdf Users Manual for Siemens Capacitive Sensors p.54]&lt;/ref&gt; This leads to a variety of differences between the two sensing technologies, with the most notable differences being that capacitive sensors are generally capable of higher resolution measurements, and eddy current sensors work in dirty environments while capacitive sensors do not.&lt;ref name="CapVEddy"/&gt;

==History==
The CIRC was conceived in 2000 by Professor John Robinson and designed by Peter Busby who excelled in green building designs.&lt;ref name="history"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cirs.ubc.ca/building/history |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-02-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121221063617/http://cirs.ubc.ca/building/history |archivedate=2012-12-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Together, they organized and talked to potential partners which led to Alberto Cayuela, formally an employee of Stantec and now associate director responsible for CIRS, joining the team as program manager.&lt;ref name="history" /&gt;

Once funding and concept was decided, the location was chosen.  Originally, it was to be built on the UBC Point Grey campus, but, because CIRS was an inter-instituational project (UBC leads the project in conjunction with Simon Fraser University, BC Institute of Technology, and Emily Carr University of Art + Design) it was felt that the Great Northern Way campus would be a better position.&lt;ref name="history" /&gt;  In line with the idea of an inter-institutional project, the new position would expand its scope and breadth.&lt;ref name="history" /&gt;

In 2008, the decision to move CIRS back to UBC Point Grey campus was made due to delays to the project timeline brought on by the complexity of building on the Great Northern Campus.&lt;ref name="history" /&gt; Although, now only one institution (UBC) owned CIRS, other institutions continued to participate through other means.&lt;ref name="history" /&gt;

Construction began in 2009 with excavation and foundation work for the first six months with the building being complete in August 2011.&lt;ref name="history" /&gt;

==Building Benefits==

===Structural Systems===
The CIRS is constructed of wood and allows for various benefits such as reducing ecological impact, sequestering carbon, helping the mitigation of an ecological problem, bringing warmth to the building interiors, and also maximizing daylight and views.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://cirs.ubc.ca/building/building-manual/structural-systems# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2013-02-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121221132359/http://cirs.ubc.ca/building/building-manual/structural-systems# |archive-date=2012-12-21 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Building Materials===
The primary exterior material is white brick, clear glazing, wood, and neutral colored concrete.  The benefits are the reduction of 'red list' materials, improvement of indoor air quality, reduction of material waste, and reduction of carbon emissions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://cirs.ubc.ca/building/building-manual/building-materials# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2013-02-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130216140017/http://cirs.ubc.ca/building/building-manual/building-materials# |archive-date=2013-02-16 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Energy Systems===
The CIRS achieves a net-positive energy performance and reduces UBC's overall energy consumption by over 1 million kilowatt hours per year. The energy system benefits the project by providing a comparison between energy modelling processes, allows for more opportunities for research and system testing, inspire a new approach to energy supply/consumption, reduce heat demand and carbon emissions of neighboring buildings, and provide opportunities for continued learning.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://cirs.ubc.ca/building/building-manual/energy-systems# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2013-02-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130216140005/http://cirs.ubc.ca/building/building-manual/energy-systems# |archive-date=2013-02-16 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rainwater System===
CIRS is entirely water self-sufficient by harvesting rainwater and stored in a 100-cubic-meter cistern underneath the building.  Around 1,226,000 litres of rainwater is harvested throughout the year, and average demand is 2000 litres per day.  The benefits of a rainwater potable water system is that it creates awareness, educates the public on water supply/consumption, reduces potable water demand, promotes stormwater management, and provides an onsite water source for fire suppression.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://cirs.ubc.ca/building/building-manual/rainwater-system# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2013-02-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130216135941/http://cirs.ubc.ca/building/building-manual/rainwater-system# |archive-date=2013-02-16 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reclaimed Water===
All the reclaimed water originates either from the CIRS building or sewer system which is treated onsite using a Solar Aquatics wastewater treatment system and reused in the building for toilet flushing and to irrigate the living roof, landscaped areas and the living wall.  The main benefit of this treatment system is awareness and engaging the public in viewing sustainability as a possibility.  &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://cirs.ubc.ca/building/building-manual/reclaimed-water# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2013-02-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130216135953/http://cirs.ubc.ca/building/building-manual/reclaimed-water# |archive-date=2013-02-16 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lighting===
Narrow floor plates allowed for daylight penetration and light to enter the building from both sides.  The benefits is that it improves the inhabitant health and comfort, creates a friendly space, reduces energy consumption and cost, and provides a surface for photovoltaic cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://cirs.ubc.ca/building/building-manual/lighting# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2013-02-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121221132349/http://cirs.ubc.ca/building/building-manual/lighting# |archive-date=2012-12-21 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ventilation===
The CIRS uses a mixed mode system utilizing mostly passive natural ventilation.  There are two mechanical air handling units that supply fresh filtered air: one to the large auditorium and the other to the rest of the building.  In addition, there are manual operable windows that allows for airflow and temperature control.  This system reduces energy consumption, connects the inhabitants with nature, and improve their health.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://cirs.ubc.ca/building/building-manual/ventilation# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2013-03-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121221132404/http://cirs.ubc.ca/building/building-manual/ventilation# |archive-date=2012-12-21 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public Recognition==
The CIRS has been publicly recognized by many as "North America's Greenest Building" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.thomasnet.com/green_clean/2011/12/05/university-of-british-columbia-claims-credit-for-north-americas-greenest-building/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-03-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130317110349/http://news.thomasnet.com/green_clean/2011/12/05/university-of-british-columbia-claims-credit-for-north-americas-greenest-building/ |archivedate=2013-03-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and one of the greenest buildings in the world.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.awaken.com/2012/09/five-of-the-greenest-buildings-in-the-world/&lt;/ref&gt; Most recently in 2013, the CIRS won the Green Building Award awarded by the Wood WORKS! BC Wood Design Awards.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.canadianarchitect.com/news/2013-bc-wood-design-awards-announced/1002120145/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Contesting the Future of Nuclear Power: A Critical Global Assessment of Atomic Energy''''' is a 2011 book by [[Benjamin K. Sovacool]], published by [[World Scientific]]. Sovacool’s book addresses the current status of the global nuclear power industry, its fuel cycle, nuclear accidents, environmental impacts, social risks, energy payback, nuclear power economics, and industry subsidies. There is a postscript on the Japanese 2011 [[Fukushima nuclear disaster]].&lt;ref name=diesrev/&gt; Based on detailed analysis, Sovacool concludes "that a global nuclear renaissance would bring immense technical, economic, environmental, political, and social costs". He says that it is [[renewable energy]] technologies which will enhance [[Energy security and renewable technology|energy security]], and which have many other advantages.&lt;ref name=diesrev&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ies.unsw.edu.au/sites/all/files/MD%20BookReview_EnergyPolicy2013.pdf |title=Book review: Contesting the future of nuclear power |author=[[Mark Diesendorf]] |date=2013 |work=Energy Policy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.worldscibooks.com/etextbook/7895/7895_chap08.pdf |title=The "Self-Limiting" Future of Nuclear Power |author=Benjamin K.

The book says the marginal levelized cost for "a 1,000-MWe facility built in 2009 would be 41.2 to 80.3 cents/kWh, presuming one actually takes into account construction, operation and fuel, reprocessing, waste storage, and decommissioning."&lt;ref&gt;Sovacool, p. 126.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a review by author [[Mark Diesendorf]] the book "reviews the little-known research which shows that the [[Life-cycle greenhouse-gas emissions of energy sources|life-cycle CO2 emissions of nuclear power]] may become comparable with those of fossil power as high-grade uranium ore is used up over the next several decades and low-grade uranium is mined and milled using fossil fuels".&lt;ref name=diesrev/&gt;  Diesendorf says that one weakness of the book is the limited coverage of [[nuclear weapons proliferation]]. He says that governments of several countries (e.g., France, India, North Korea, Pakistan) have used nuclear power and/or research reactors to assist nuclear weapons development or to contribute to their supplies of nuclear explosives from military reactors.&lt;ref name=diesrev/&gt;

[[Image:DIY DAC IMG 1229 061231 134836.jpg|thumb|An example of DIY audio: a functioning [[Battery (electricity)|battery]]-operated DAC ([[Digital-to-analog converter]]) before installation in a box case]]
'''DIY Audio''' means "[[do it yourself]]" [[sound reproduction|audio]].  Rather than buying a piece of possibly expensive audio equipment, such as a [[high-end audio]] amplifier or speaker, the person practicing DIY Audio will make it him/herself. Alternatively, a DIYer may take an existing manufactured item of vintage era and update or modify it. The benefits of doing so include the satisfaction of creating something enjoyable, the possibility that the equipment made or updated is of higher quality than commercially available products and the pleasure of creating a custom-made device for which no exact equivalent is marketed. Other motivations for DIY audio can include getting audio components at a lower cost, the entertainment of using the item, and being able to ensure quality of workmanship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zero-distortion.com/techno/diy1/diy1.htm |title=DIY Pros and Cons |author=Veselinovic, Dejan V. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071223192445/http://www.zero-distortion.com/techno/diy1/diy1.htm |archivedate=December 23, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Audio DIY came to prominence in the 1950s to 1960s, as audio reproduction was relatively new and the technology "complex," audio reproduction equipment, and in particular high performance equipment, was not offered at the retail level.  Kits and designs were available for consumers to build their own equipment.  Famous [[vacuum tube]] kits from [[Dynaco]], [[Heathkit]], and [[McIntosh Laboratory|McIntosh]], as well as solid state ([[transistor]]) kits from Hafler allowed for consumers to build their own hi fidelity systems.  Books and magazines were published which explained new concepts regarding the design and operation of vacuum tube and (later) transistor circuits.

While audio equipment has become easily accessible in the current day and age, there still exists an interest in building and repairing one's own equipment including, but not limited to; pre-amplifiers, amplifiers, speakers, cables, CD players and [[phonograph|turntables]].  Today, a network of companies, parts vendors, and on-line communities exist to foster this interest.  DIY is especially active in loudspeaker and in tube amplification.  Both are relatively simple to design and fabricate without access to sophisticated industrial equipment.  Both enable the builder to pick and choose between various available parts, on matters of price as well as quality, allow for extensive experimentation, and offer the chance to use exotic or highly labor-intensive solutions, which would be expensive for a manufacturer to implement, but only require personal labor by the DIYer, which is a source of satisfaction to them.

==Construction issues==
Since the 1960s, [[integrated circuit]]s make construction of DIY audio systems easier, but the proliferation of [[surface mount technology|surface mount]] components (which are very small and difficult to solder with a [[soldering iron]]) and fine pitch [[printed circuit board]]s (PCBs) arguably make the physical act of construction more difficult. Nevertheless, surface mounting is often used, as are conventional PCBs and electronic components, while some enthusiasts insist on using old-style perforated cardboard onto which individual components are "hardwired" and soldered. [[electronic test equipment|Test equipment]] is readily available for purchase and enables convenient testing of parts and systems.  Specifications of parts and components are readily accessible through the Internet including data sheets and equipment designs.

It has become easier to make audio components from "scratch" rather than from "kits" due to the availability of [[computer-aided design|CAD]] software for [[printed circuit board]] (PCB) layouts and electronic circuit [[simulation]].  Such software can be free, and a trial version may also be used.  PCB vendors are more accessible than ever, and can manufacture PCBs in small quantities for the do-it-yourselfer. In fact, kits and chemicals for self-manufacturing one's own PCB can be obtained. Electronic parts and components are accessible online or in specialty shops, and various "high-end" parts vendors exist.  On the other hand, a wide variety of kits, designs and premanufactured PCBs are available for almost any type of audio component.

To construct a device takes more than knowledge of [[electrical network|circuits]], many would urge that the mechanical aspects of cabinets, cases and chassis' are the most time consuming aspects of audio DIY.  [[Drill]]ing, [[metalworking]] and physical [[measurement]]s are critical to constructing almost any DIY audio project, especially speakers.  Measuring equipment such as a [[Caliper#Vernier caliper|Vernier caliper]] is often essential.  Woodworking skills are required to construct wooden enclosures (e.g. for speakers), with some enthusiasts going beyond traditional woodworking to [[CNC]] turning, and luxurious [[Wood veneer|veneer]]s and [[lacquer]]s.  Room acoustics solutions are also popular among DIYers, as they can be made with inexpensive and readily available insulating materials, and can be dimensioned to fit each particular room in a precise and aesthetically pleasing way.

DIY audio involves "projects" directed to audio.  Many DIY audio people fancy themselves to be [[audiophile]]s.  These people use rare and expensive parts and components in their projects.  Examples are the use of [[silver]] wire, expensive [[capacitor]]s, non-standard [[solder]]s of various alloys, and use of parts that have been [[cryogenics|cryogenically cooled]].

[[vacuum tube|Vacuum tube or "valve"]] projects are common in audio DIY.  While, for mass market audio components, the vacuum tube has been replaced in modern times with the [[transistor]] and IC, the vacuum tube remains prominent in specialty high end audio equipment.  Thus, interest exists in building components using vacuum tubes, and the vacuum tube is still widely available.  There is a wide variety of tubes manufactured nowadays, and many tubes on the market are advertised as "NOS" ("new, old stock", meaning unused stock of old manufacture); not all of the latter being genuinely NOS.  Circuits utilizing tubes often are far less complicated than those utilizing transistors or op-amps.  Tube enthusiasts often use transformers, sometimes custom-made ones, or even hand-wind their own transformers using cores and wire of their own choice.  Note that vacuum tube projects almost always use [[High voltage|dangerously high voltages]] and should be undertaken with due care.

In case [[Solder#Lead solder|lead-containing solder]] is used instead of [[Solder#Lead-free solder|RoHS-compliant solder]], appropriate environmental precautions with regard to lead and lead products should be taken.

==Tweaking and tweakers==
[[Image:DIY Rebuilt Vintage Magnavox Speakers.jpg|thumb|Rebuilt and refinished [[Magnavox]] wood speaker using a Dayton 2 way crossover, Peerless 6 1/2 inch woofer, and Usher Audio 1 1/8 inch [[tweeter]].]]
DIY audio can also involve "tweaking" of mass market components.  It is thought that mass market audio components are compromised by the use of cheap or inferior internal parts that can be easily replaced with high quality substitutes.  As a result, an audio component of improved characteristics may be obtained for relatively low cost. Some common changes include replacing [[opamp]]s, replacing capacitors (recap), or even replacing resistors in order to increase [[signal-to-noise ratio]]. Changing an audio component in this way is similar to what a [[tweaking|tweaker]] or [[modding|modder]] does with a personal computer.

==Circuit bending==
[[Circuit bending]] is the creative customization of the circuits within electronic devices such as low [[voltage]], battery-powered [[guitar effects]], and small digital [[synthesizer]]s to create new musical or visual instruments and sound generators.  Emphasizing spontaneity and randomness, the techniques of circuit bending have been commonly associated with [[noise music]], though many more conventional contemporary musicians and musical groups have been known to experiment with "bent" instruments. Circuit bending usually involves dismantling the machine and adding components such as switches and [[potentiometer]]s that alter the circuit.

==Cloning and cloners==
Another common practice in the DIY audio community is to attempt to "clone" or copy a preexisting design or component from a commercial manufacturer.  This involves obtaining a lawful public version of, or lawfully [[reverse engineering]], the circuit [[schematic]]s for the design, and/or even the publicly available PCB layouts.  Such a "clone" will not be a perfect copy since different brands and types of parts (often newer parts) will be used, and mechanical aspects of construction will likely differ.  However, the circuit or other distinguishing features should be close to the original.

There are many reasons for wanting to recreate an existing design.  The design might be historically important and/or out of production, so the only way to obtain the component is to build it.  The design might be very simple so copying it is easily done.  The commercial product might be very expensive but its design known, so it may be  built for far less than it cost to be purchased.  The original design may have some sentimental value to the person building the recreation, and the design built for the memories in one's past.  The copy may be made to test or evaluate design concepts or principles in the original.

As an example, a well known "clone" includes amplifiers using high power integrated circuits, such as the [[National Semiconductor]] [[LM3875]] and LM3886.  The use of a high power IC as part of a quality audio amplifier was popularized by the [[47 Labs]] [[Gaincard]] amplifier, and thus the DIY amplifiers using power ICs are often called "chipamps" or "[[Gainclone]]s."

Usually cloning additionally involves improving or tweaking (see above) the original design, potentially by using more modern components (in the case of discontinued designs,) higher quality parts, or more efficient board layout.

==Operational amplifier swapping==
{{reliable sources|section|date=June 2016}}

[[Operational amplifier]] (op-amps) swapping is the process of replacing an [[operational amplifier]] in audio equipment with a different one, in an attempt to improve performance or change the perceived sound quality. Op-amps are used in most audio devices, and most op-amps have the same pinouts, making replacement fairly simple.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.techpowerup.com/52563/Auzentech_Now_Offers_Swappable_OPAMPs.html Auzentech Now Offers Swappable OPAMPs]&lt;/ref&gt; If the new device's parameters sometimes do not match it can lead to problems like [[high-frequency oscillation]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.diyaudio.com/forums/analog-line-level/191389-swapping-op-amps-you-have-checked-see-its-stable-havent-you.html Swapping Op-Amps... you have checked to see it's stable haven't you ?]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Open deaerator plant.jpg|thumb|Deaerator plant]]

A '''deaerator''' is a device that removes oxygen and other dissolved [[gas]]es from water, such as [[feedwater]] for steam-generating [[boiler]]s. Dissolved [[oxygen]] in feedwater will cause serious corrosion damage in a boiler by attaching to the walls of metal piping and other equipment and forming [[oxide]]s (rust). Dissolved [[carbon dioxide]] combines with water to form [[carbonic acid]] that causes further corrosion. Most deaerators are designed to remove oxygen down to levels of 7 [[Parts per billion|ppb]] by weight (0.005&amp;nbsp;cm³/L) or less, as well as essentially eliminating carbon dioxide.&lt;ref name="Sterling"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.sterlingdeaerator.com/principle.htm| title=The Deaerating Principle| publisher=Sterling Deaerator Company}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Stork"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.stork.com/en/products-services/power-services-products/stork-thermeq/deaerators| title=Deaerators| publisher=Stork}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Deaerator Working Principle'''

Deaeration relies on the principle that the solubility of a gas in water decreases as the water temperature increases and approaches [[boiling point|saturation temperature]]. In the deaerator, water is heated up to close to saturation temperature with a minimum pressure drop and minimum vent. Deaeration is done by spraying the feedwater to provide a large surface area, and may involve flow over multiple layers of trays. This scrubbing (or stripping) steam is fed to the bottom of the deaeration section of the deaerator. When steam contacts the feedwater, it heats it up to saturation temperature and dissolved gases are released from the feedwater and vented from the deaerator through the vent. The treated water falls to the storage tank below the deaerator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://boilersinfo.com/deaerator-working-principle/| title=Deaerator working principle| publisher=Boilers Info}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sterling" /&gt;

==Types of deaerators==
There are many different horizontal and vertical deaerators available from a number of manufacturers, and the actual construction details will vary from one manufacturer to another. Figures 1 and 2 are representative schematic diagrams that depict each of the two major types of deaerators.

There are two basic types of deaerators, the Termochimica spray&amp;tray-type and the Stork spray-type:&lt;ref name="Stork" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Robert Thurston Kent]] (Editor in Chief)|title=Kents’ Mechanical Engineers’ Handbook|edition=Eleventh edition (Two volumes)|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons (Wiley Engineering Handbook Series)|year=1936|id=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Babcock &amp; Wilcox Co.|title=Steam: Its Generation and Use|edition=41st|year=2005|isbn=0-9634570-0-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Thomas C. Elliott, Kao Chen, Robert Swanekamp (coauthors)|title=Standard Handbook of Powerplant Engineering|edition=2nd|publisher=McGraw-Hill Professional|year=1997|isbn=0-07-019435-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The ''Termochimica spray&amp;tray-type'' (also called the ''cascade-type'') includes a vertical or horizontal domed [[wikt:deaeration|deaeration]] section mounted on top of a horizontal cylindrical vessel which serves as the deaerated boiler feedwater  storage tank.
* The ''Stork spray-type'' consists only of a horizontal (or vertical) cylindrical vessel which serves as both the deaeration section and the storage tank for boiler feedwater.

===Termochimica Spray&amp;Tray-type Deaerator===
[[File:Deaerator.png|thumb|391 px|right|Figure 1: A schematic diagram of a typical tray-type deaerator.]]

The typical spray&amp;tray-type deaerator in Figure 1 has a vertical domed deaeration section mounted above a horizontal boiler feedwater storage vessel. Boiler feedwater enters the vertical deaeration  section through spray valves above the perforated [[Theoretical plate|trays]] and then flows downward through the perforations. Low-pressure deaeration steam enters below the perforated trays and flows upward through the perforations. Combined action of spray valves &amp; trays guarantees very high performance (as confirmed by HEI std ) because of longer contact time between steam and water. Some designs use various types of [[packed bed]], rather than perforated trays, to provide good contact and mixing between the steam and the boiler feed water.

The steam strips the dissolved gas from the boiler feedwater and exits via the vent valve at the top of the domed section. Should this vent valve not be opened sufficiently the deaerator will not work properly, causing high oxygen content in the feed water going to the boilers. Should the boiler not have an oxygen-content analyser, a high level in the boiler chlorides may indicate the vent valve not being far enough open. Some designs may include a vent condenser to trap and recover any water [[Entrainment (engineering)|entrained]] in the vented gas. The vent line usually includes a valve and just enough steam is allowed to escape with the vented gases to provide a small visible telltale plume of steam.

The deaerated water flows down into the horizontal storage vessel from where it is pumped to the steam generating boiler system. Low-pressure heating steam, which enters the horizontal vessel through a ''sparger pipe'' in the bottom of the vessel, is provided to keep the stored boiler feedwater warm. External [[Thermal insulation|insulation]] of the vessel is typically provided to minimize heat loss.

=== Stork Spray-type deaerator ===

[[Image:SprayDeaerator.png|right|thumb|287px|Figure 2: A schematic diagram of a typical spray-type deaerator.]]

As shown in Figure 2, the typical spray-type deaerator is a horizontal vessel which has a preheating section (E) and a deaeration section (F). The two sections are separated by a baffle (C). Low-pressure steam enters the vessel through a sparger in the bottom of the vessel.

The boiler feedwater is sprayed into section (E) where it is preheated by the rising steam from the sparger. The purpose of the feedwater spray nozzle (A) and the preheat section is to heat the boiler feedwater to its [[Boiling point#Saturation temperature and pressure|saturation temperature]] to facilitate stripping out the dissolved gases in the following deaeration section.

The preheated feedwater then flows into the deaeration section (F), where it is deaerated by the steam rising from the sparger system. The gases stripped out of the water exit via the vent at the top of the vessel. Again, some designs may include a vent condenser to trap and recover any water entrained in the vented gas. Also again, the vent line usually includes a valve and just enough steam is allowed to escape with the vented gases to provide a small and visible telltale plume of steam.

The deaerated boiler feedwater is pumped from the bottom of the vessel to the steam generating boiler system.

== Deaeration steam ==

The deaerators in the steam generating systems of most [[thermal power plant]]s use low pressure steam obtained from an extraction point in their [[steam turbine]] system. However, the steam generators in many large industrial facilities such as [[Oil refinery|petroleum refineries]] may use whatever low-pressure steam is available.

== Oxygen scavengers ==
Oxygen scavenging chemicals are very often added to the deaerated boiler feedwater to remove any last traces of oxygen that were not removed by the deaerator.
The type of chemical added depends on whether the location uses a volatile or non-volatile water treatment program. Most lower pressure systems (&lt;650psi) use a non-volatile program. Most higher pressure systems (&gt;650psi) and all systems where certain highly alloyed materials are present, are now using volatile programs as the old phosphate-based programs are phased out.
Volatile programs are further broken down into oxidizing or reducing programs [(AVT(O) or AVT(R)] depending whether the waterside environment requires an oxidizing or reducing environment to reduce the incidence of flow-accelerated corrosion (FAC) which is a highly debated topic within the industry today. FAC-related failures have caused numerous accidents in which significant loss of property and life has occurred.

The most commonly used oxygen scavenger for lower pressure systems is [[sodium sulfite]] (Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;). It is very effective and rapidly reacts with traces of oxygen to form [[sodium sulfate]] (Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) which is non-scaling.  Another widely used oxygen scavenger is [[hydrazine]] (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;), used for locations using volatile programs.

Other scavengers include [[1,3-diaminourea]] (also known as [[carbohydrazide]]), [[diethylhydroxylamine]] (DEHA), [[nitrilotriacetic acid]] (NTA), [[ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid]] (EDTA), and [[hydroquinone]].

'''Dell Technologies Inc.''' is an American [[multinational corporation|multinational]] information technology corporation based in [[Round Rock, Texas]]. It was formed as a result of the acquisition of [[Dell]] and EMC Corporation (which later became [[Dell EMC]]).&lt;ref name="6things"&gt;{{cite news | title=The new Dell Technologies: 6 things you need to know | url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/3117631/hardware/the-new-dell-technologies-6-things-you-need-to-know.html | | last=Shah | first=Agam | publisher=[[PC World]] | date=September 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dell's products include personal computers, [[Server (computing)|servers]], [[smartphones]], televisions, computer software, [[computer security|computer]] and [[network security]], as well as [[information security]] services.&lt;ref name=6things/&gt; Dell ranked No. 35 on the 2018 [[Fortune 500]] rankings of the largest United States corporations by total revenue.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://fortune.com/fortune500/list/|title=Fortune 500 Companies 2018: Who Made the List|website=Fortune|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current operations==
As of 2016, approximately 50% of the company's revenue is derived in the United States.&lt;ref name=10K/&gt;

Dell operates under 3 divisions as follows:&lt;ref name=10K/&gt;

* [[Dell EMC]] Infrastructure Solutions Group (35% of 2016 revenues) – storage solutions
* [[VMware]] (5% of 2016 revenues) – a publicly traded company focused on virtualization and cloud infrastructure 

Dell also owns 4 separate businesses: [[RSA_Security|RSA]], [[Pivotal Software]], [[SecureWorks]], and Boomi, Inc.&lt;ref name=10K/&gt;

==History==
[[File:Dell EMC logo.svg|thumb|right|Dell–EMC merger wordmark introduced in 2016]]
On October 12, 2015, [[Dell]] announced its intent to acquire the enterprise software and storage company EMC Corporation in a $67&amp;nbsp;billion transaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20151012005487/en/CORRECTING-REPLACING-Michael-S.-Dell-MSD-Partners | title=Michael S.

On September 7, 2016, Dell Inc. completed the merger with EMC Corp., which involved the issuance of $45.9&amp;nbsp;billion in debt and $4.4&amp;nbsp;billion common stock.&lt;ref name=10K/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | url=http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20160907005946/en/Historic-Dell-EMC-Merger-Complete-Forms-World%E2%80%99s | title=Historic Dell and EMC Merger Complete; Forms World's Largest Privately-Controlled Tech Company | publisher=[[Business Wire]] | date=September 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Dell Services]], [[Dell Software]] Group, and the Dell EMC Enterprise Content Divisions were sold shortly thereafter for proceeds of $7.0&amp;nbsp;billion, which was used to repay debt.&lt;ref name=10K/&gt;In October 2017, It was reported that Dell would be investing $1 billion in IoT research and development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.businessreviewusa.com/technology/6079/Dell-Technologies-creates-new-IoT-division-as-part-of-three-year-1bn-investment|title=Dell Technologies creates new IoT division as part of three-year, $1bn investment|website=www.businessreviewusa.com|access-date=2017-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://fortune.com/2017/10/10/dell-technologies-new-iot-division/|title=Michael Dell Vows to Invest $1 Billion over Three Years to Fund Internet of Things Business|work=Fortune|access-date=2017-10-19|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/patrickmoorhead/2017/10/17/dell-technologies-iqt-doubling-down-on-the-internet-of-things/#ef4d67048e9b|title=Dell Technologies IQT: Doubling Down On The Internet Of Things|last=Moorhead|first=Patrick|work=Forbes|access-date=2017-10-19|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dell acquisition of EMC===
The announcement came two years after Dell Inc. returned to private ownership, claiming that it faced bleak prospects and would need several years out of the public eye to rebuild its business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | newspaper = [[The Wall Street Journal]] | title=Dell Makes Case to Go Private in Grim Filing | url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887323501004578390692268605644 | date=March 29, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It's thought that the company's value has roughly doubled since then.&lt;ref name="WSJ-2015-10-12"&gt;{{cite news | newspaper=[[Wall Street Journal]] | author=David Benoit| title=Dell's Value and the 'Falling Knife' | url=https://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2015/10/12/dells-value-and-the-falling-knife/ | date = October 12, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; EMC was being pressured by [[Elliott Management Corporation|Elliott Management]], a hedge fund holding 2.2% of EMC's stock, to reorganize their unusual "Federation" structure, in which EMC's divisions were effectively being run as independent companies. Elliott argued&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20141008005668/en/Elliott-Management-Sends-Letter-Board-Directors-EMC# | title=Elliott Management Sends Letter to Board of Directors of EMC Corporation | publisher=[[Business Wire]] | date=October 8, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; this structure deeply undervalued EMC's core "EMC II" data storage business, and that increasing competition between EMC II and VMware products was confusing the market and hindering both companies. ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' estimated that in 2014 Dell had revenue of $27.3&amp;nbsp;billion from personal computers and $8.9&amp;nbsp;billion from servers, while EMC had $16.5&amp;nbsp;billion from EMC II, $1bn from [[RSA Security]], $6bn from [[VMware]], and $230&amp;nbsp;million from [[Pivotal Software]].&lt;ref name="WSJ-2015-10-13"&gt;{{cite news | newspaper=[[Wall Street Journal]] | title=EMC Takeover Marks Return of Michael Dell | url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/dell-to-buy-emc-for-67-billion-1444649012 | date = October 13, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; EMC owns around 80% of the stock of VMware.&lt;ref name="FT-Lex-2015-10-12"&gt;{{cite news | title=Dell-EMC: The empty shop | newspaper=[[Financial Times]] | date=October 12, 2015 | url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/3/abfd601e-7102-11e5-ad6d-f4ed76f0900a.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; The proposed acquisition will maintain VMware as a separate company, held via a new [[tracking stock]], while the other parts of EMC will be rolled into Dell.&lt;ref name="FT-2015-10-12"&gt;{{cite news | title=Dell agrees $63bn acquisition of EMC | newspaper=[[Financial Times]] | date=October 12, 2015 | url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/170fa5f2-708a-11e5-9b9e-690fdae72044.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; Once the acquisition closes Dell will again publish quarterly financial results, having ceased these on going private in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-10-21/dell-cfo-reluctantly-accepts-public-disclosures-with-emc-deal | title=Dell CFO Reluctantly Accepts Public Disclosures With EMC Deal | date=October 21, 2015 | author=Brian Womack}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Vap-Liq Separator.png|thumb|right|246px|A typical, large-scale, [[vapor-liquid separator]] as used in [[Oil refinery|oil refineries]], [[petrochemical]] and [[chemical plant]]s]]
A '''demister''' is a device often fitted to [[vapor–liquid separator]] vessels to enhance the removal of liquid droplets [[Entrainment (engineering)|entrained]] in a vapor stream. Demisters may be a mesh-type [[coalescer]], vane pack or other structure intended to aggregate the mist into droplets that are heavy enough to separate from the vapor stream. 

Demisters can reduce the residence time required to separate a given liquid droplet size by reducing the volume and associated cost of separator equipment.  Demisters are often used where [[vapor quality]] is important in regard to entrained liquids, particularly where separator equipment costs are high (e.g., high-pressure systems) or where space or weight savings are advantageous.

For example, in the process of [[brine]] [[water desalination|desalination]] on marine vessels, [[brine]] is [[flash evaporation|flash-heated into vapor]].  In flashing, vapor carries over droplets of brine, which have to be separated before condensing, otherwise the [[distillate]] vapor would be contaminated with [[salt]]. This is the role of the demister. Demisted vapor condenses on tubes in the desalination plant, and product water is collected in the [[distillate]] tray.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3043">[[File:Drilling_Riser.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Drilling riser joints with buoyancy modules]]
A '''drilling riser''' is a conduit that provides a temporary extension of a [[subsea]] [[oil well]] to a surface drilling facility. Drilling risers are categorised into two types: '''marine drilling risers''' used with subsea [[blowout preventer]] (BOP) and generally used by floating drilling vessels; and '''tie-back drilling risers''' used with a surface BOP and generally deployed from [[Fixed Platform|fixed platforms]] or very stable floating platforms like a [[Spar (platform)|spar]] or [[tension leg platform]] (TLP).&lt;ref&gt;Oilfield glossary – [http://www.glossary.oilfield.slb.com/Display.cfm?Term=drilling%20riser Drilling riser]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marine drilling riser==
A marine drilling riser has a large diameter, low pressure main tube with external auxiliary lines that include high pressure choke and kill lines for circulating fluids to the subsea [[blowout preventer]] (BOP), and usually power and control lines for the BOP.
The design and operation of marine drilling risers is complex, and the requirement for high reliability means an extensive amount of engineering analysis is required.&lt;ref&gt;Fundamentals of Marine Riser Mechanics: Basic Principles and Simplified Analysis, Charles P. Sparks, {{ISBN|978-1-59370-070-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When used in water depths greater than about 20 meters, the marine drilling riser has to be tensioned to maintain stability. A [[marine riser tensioner]] located on the drilling platform provides a near constant tension force adequate to maintain the stability of the riser in the offshore environment. The level of tension required is related to the weight of the riser equipment, the buoyancy of the riser, the forces from waves and currents, the weight of the internal fluids, and an adequate allowance for equipment failures.

To reduce the amount of tension required to maintain stability of the riser, buoyancy modules, known in the industry as 'buoyancy cakes', are added to the riser joints to make them close to neutrally buoyant when submerged.


The international standard ISO 13624-1:2009 covers the design, selection, operation and maintenance of marine riser systems for floating drilling operations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iso.org/iso/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=22426 ISO 13624-1 Design and operation of marine drilling riser equipment – 22426]&lt;/ref&gt; Its purpose is to serve as a reference for designers, for those who select system components, and for those who use and maintain this equipment. It relies on basic engineering principles and the accumulated experience of offshore operators, contractors, and manufacturers.

==Tie-back drilling riser==
A tie-back riser can be either a single large-diameter high pressure pipe, or a set of concentric pipes extending the casing strings in the well up to a surface BOP.{{cn|date=November 2018}}

{{Contains Tibetan text}}
'''Dzong architecture''' is a distinctive type of fortress ({{bo|w=rdzong}}, {{IPA-all|tz&lt;sup&gt;ɦ&lt;/sup&gt;oŋ˩˨}}) [[architectural style|architecture]] found mainly in [[Bhutan]] and [[Tibet]]. The architecture is massive in style with towering exterior walls surrounding a complex of [[courtyard]]s, temples, administrative offices, and monks' accommodation.

==Characteristics==
Distinctive features include:
* High inward sloping walls of brick and stone painted white with few or no windows in the lower sections of the wall
* Use of a surrounding red ochre stripe near the top of the walls, sometimes punctuated by large gold circles.
* Use of unique style flared roofs atop interior temples.
* Massive entry doors made of wood and iron
* Interior courtyards and temples brightly colored in Buddhist-themed art [[Motif (visual arts)|motifs]] such as the [[ashtamangala]] or [[swastika]], for example.

==Regional differences==

===Bhutan===
{{See also|History of Bhutan}}
Dzongs serve as the religious, military, administrative, and social centers of their district. They are often the site of an annual ''[[tsechu]]'' or religious festival.

The rooms inside the dzong are typically allocated half to administrative function (such as the office of the ''[[penlop]]'' or governor), and half to religious function, primarily the temple and housing for monks. This division between administrative and religious functions reflects the idealized [[dual system of government|duality of power]] between the religious and administrative branches of government.

===Tibet===
{{Further|List of administrative divisions of the Tibet Autonomous Region}}
Tibet used to be divided into 53 prefecture districts also called ''dzongs''.&lt;ref name=Tibet&gt;''Le Tibet'', Marc Moniez, Christian Deweirdt, Monique Masse, Éditions de l'Adret, Paris, 1999, {{ISBN|2-907629-46-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were two [[dzongpen|dzongpöns]] for each dzong, a [[lama]] and a layman. They were entrusted with both civil and military powers and are equal in all respects, though subordinate to the generals and the Chinese [[amban]] in military matters,&lt;ref&gt;[[Sarat Chandra Das|Das, Sarat Chandra]]. (1902). ''Lhasa and Central Tibet''. Reprint (1988): Mehra Offset Press, Delhi, p. 176.&lt;/ref&gt; until the expulsion of the ambans following the [[Xinhai Revolution]] in 1912.&lt;ref name=Tibet/&gt; Today, 71 [[List of administrative divisions of the Tibet Autonomous Region|counties]] in the [[Tibet Autonomous Region]] are called ''dzong''s in the [[Tibetic languages]].

==Siting of dzongs==
[[Image:TrongsaDzong.jpg|thumb|left|250px|[[Trongsa Dzong]], the largest dzong fortress in [[Bhutan]].]]
Bhutanese dzong architecture reached its zenith in the 17th century under the leadership of [[Ngawang Namgyal]], the 1st [[Zhabdrung Rinpoche]]. The Zhabdrung relied on visions and omens to site each of the dzongs. Modern military strategists would observe that the dzongs are well-sited with regard to their function as defensive fortresses. [[Wangdue Phodrang]] dzong, for instance, is set upon a spur overlooking the confluence of the [[Sankosh River|Sankosh]] (Puna Tsang) and [[Tang Chuu|Tang]] Rivers, thus blocking any attacks by southern invaders who attempted to use a river route to bypass the trackless slopes of the middle Himalayas in attacking central Bhutan. [[Drukgyel]] Dzong at the head of the [[Paro, Bhutan|Paro]] valley guards the traditional [[Tibet]]an invasion path over the passes of the high Himalayas.
[[Image:Wangdue Phodrang Dzong.jpg|thumb|230px|right|Dzong at [[Wangdue Phodrang]], Bhutan.]]
Dzongs were frequently built on a hilltop or mountain spur. If the dzong is built on the side of a valley wall, a smaller dzong or watchtower is typically built directly uphill from the main dzong with the purpose of keeping the slope clear of attackers who might otherwise shoot downward into the courtyard of the main dzong below (see image at head of article).

[[Punakha Dzong]] is distinctive in that it is sited on a relatively flat spit of land at the confluence of the [[Mo Chhu|Mo]] and [[Pho Chhu|Pho]] Rivers. The rivers surround the dzong on three sides, providing protection from attack. This siting proved inauspicious, however, when in 1994 a glacial lake 90 kilometers upstream burst through its [[Ice jam|ice dam]] to cause a massive flood on the Pho Chhu, damaging the dzong and taking 23 lives.

==Construction==
[[Image:Bhutan architecture dzong roof.jpg|thumb|upright|Roof construction at Tongsa dzong.]]
By tradition, dzongs are constructed without the use of architectural plans. Instead construction proceeds under the direction of a high [[lama]] who establishes each dimension by means of spiritual inspiration.

In previous times the dzongs were built using [[corvée]] labor which was applied as a tax against each household in the district. Under this obligation each family was to provide or hire a decreed number of workers to work for several months at a time (during quiet periods in the agricultural year) in the construction of the dzong.

Dzongs comprise heavy [[masonry]] curtain walls surrounding one or more courtyards. The main functional spaces are usually arranged in two separate areas: the administrative offices; and the religious functions - including temples and monks' accommodation. This accommodation is arranged along the inside of the outer walls and often as a separate stone tower located centrally within the courtyard, housing the main temple, that can be used as an inner defensible citadel. The main internal structures are again built with stone (or as in domestic architecture by rammed clay blocks), and whitewashed inside and out, with a broad red [[ochre]] band at the top on the outside. The larger spaces such as the temple have massive internal timber columns and beams to create galleries around an open central full height area. Smaller structures are of elaborately carved and painted timber construction.

The roofs are massively constructed in [[hardwood]] and [[bamboo]], highly decorated at the [[eaves]], and are constructed traditionally without the use of nails. They are open at the eaves to provide a ventilated storage area. They were traditionally finished with timber [[Roof shingle|shingle]]s weighted down with stones; but in almost all cases this has now been replaced with [[corrugated galvanised iron]] roofing. The roof of Tongsa Dzong, illustrated, is one of the few shingle roofs to survive and was being restored in 2006/7.

The courtyards, usually stone-flagged, are generally at a higher level than the outside and approached by massive staircases and narrow defensible entrances with large wooden doors. All doors have thresholds to discourage the entrance of spirits. Temples are usually set at a level above the courtyard with further staircases up to them.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Modern architecture in the dzong style==
Larger modern buildings in Bhutan often use the form and many of the external characteristics of dzong architecture in their construction, although incorporating modern techniques such as a concrete frame.

===University of Texas at El Paso===
The campus architecture of the [[University of Texas at El Paso]] (UTEP) is a rare example of dzong style seen outside the Himalayas. Initial phases were designed by El Paso architect [[Trost &amp; Trost|Henry Trost]], and later phases have continued in the same style.&lt;ref&gt;For more details see the ''[http://admin.utep.edu/Default.aspx?PageContentMode=1&amp;tabid=30289 UTEP Handbook of Operations] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120210043029/http://admin.utep.edu/Default.aspx?PageContentMode=1&amp;tabid=30289 |date=2012-02-10 }}''.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

==UNESCO Tentative Listing==
In 2012, the Butanese government listed five dzongs to its tentative list for [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]] inscription in the future. The five dzongs are Punakha Dzong, Wangdue Phodrang Dzong, Paro Dzong, Trongsa Dzong and Dagana Dzong.&lt;ref&gt;https://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/5695/&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Energen Wave Power''' device is a generator that uses the motion of near shore ocean surface waves to create electricity.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=XpGToXVcyi8C&amp;pg=PA238&amp;lpg=PA238&amp;dq=%22Energen+Wave+Power%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=poxEfkNDP9&amp;sig=SzumafIyjrrgj7e7ihUaBca1SGI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi0t8nj6p_YAhVHy2MKHdWQBqIQ6AEIVDAL#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Energen%20Wave%20Power%22&amp;f=false Crises of the 21st Century: Start Drilling-the Year 2020 Is Coming Fast By John Durbin Husher P238&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.theenvironmentalist.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=71&amp;Itemid=9&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ewp.rpi.edu/hartford/~ernesto/S2013/ET/MaterialsforStudents/Ott/Wave%20Energy%20Sources-Ott/Wave%20Zones%20and%20Locations/ForecastingoceanwaveenergyTestsoftime%20seriesmodels.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  It is an attenuating wave device designed for extracting energy available from a single wave over a large surface area. It has a simple robust design that will enable it to withstand harsh sea conditions. The design of the generator allows for single or modular installations. Modular installations will reduce costs making power generating sites more financially viable. The size of each generator can be changed to accommodate regional wave conditions to maximise power output and reduce energy unit costs. All power generating equipment is housed in the parallel floating pontoons, providing protection from the harsh corrosive sea conditions. 

==Operation==
The Energen device consists of a series of semi-submerged cylindrical pivoting torque tubes connected to two large cylindrical pontoons. The wave-induced movement of these torque tubes is resisted by a [[hydraulic]] system which pumps high pressure oil through [[hydraulic motor]]s. The hydraulic motors drive [[electrical generator]]s to produce electricity. 

A 50th scale model has been tested at the [[Council for Scientific and Industrial Research]] in [[Stellenbosch]] and using actual wave data off the [[South Africa]]n coast it is estimated that a single device will produce 1.4&amp;nbsp;MW of power, or 979&amp;nbsp;GW hours of electricity per annum.

'''Fenton, Murray and Jackson''' was an engineering company at the [[Round Foundry]] off Water Lane in [[Holbeck]], [[Leeds]], [[West Yorkshire]], England.

== Fenton, Murray and Wood ==
'''Fenton Murray and Wood''' was founded in the 1790s by [[Iron founder|ironfounder]] [[Matthew Murray]] and textile machine engineer David Wood to [[Machine tool builder|build machine tools]] (mainly for the [[Textile manufacturing|textile industry]]) and [[stationary steam engine]]s. The company was capitalised by [[colliery]] owner [[James Fenton (1754–1834)|James Fenton]] (1754–1834) as the main financier, and [[millwright]] William Lister, a [[sleeping partner]].&lt;ref&gt;Sources:

The partnership was approached to design a locomotive that would exploit the [[Rack railway#Blenkinsop|rack-and-pinion patent granted to Blenkinsop in 1811]]. Their 1812 product, [[Salamanca (locomotive)|''Salamanca'']] was successful, and a total of six engines were built before Murray's death in 1826.

==Fenton, Murray and Jackson==
After Wood's death in 1820, the company became '''Fenton, Murray and Jackson'''.

In 1824 the company supplied a 60[[Horsepower|hp]] [[beam engine]] to the commissioners of [[Deeping Fen]] as one of two erected at [[Pode Hole]].  The other engine was supplied by the [[Butterley Company]] as were the scoop wheels for both.  Although the Butterley engine was purchased outright (for £3,300), it appears that the Fenton and Murray engine was not.  The accounts for 1825 showed a payment of only £127/6/- for the Fenton engine.  It was not uncommon for beam engines to be leased, purchased 'on terms', or paid for in other novel ways such as a share of the earnings.  The engine was named ''[[Kesteven]]'' and worked until 1925.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| title = Machines, mills and uncountable costly necessities: a short history of the drainage of the fens| author =  R.L. Hill| publisher = Goose &amp; Son| year= 1967}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1831, work began building engines to [[Robert Stephenson]]'s designs, both [[2-2-0]] "[[Planet (locomotive)|Planets]]" and [[2-2-2]] [[Patentee locomotive|"Patentees"]], many of them under subcontract. Many were exported, and twenty of [[Daniel Gooch]]'s [[GWR Firefly Class|''Firefly'' class]] for the [[Great Western Railway]]. By 1840, they were turning out up to twenty engines a year.

The company's name appears on cast iron bollards still in situ at [[Victoria Lock (River Shannon)|Victoria Lock]] (built 1843) on the [[River Shannon]] in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]  as Fenton, Murray and Jackson Engineers of Leeds.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.buildingsofireland.ie/niah/search.jsp?type=record&amp;county=OF&amp;regno=14929013&lt;/ref&gt;

However, by 1843, the boom was over and the company closed down.

'''iCE''' is the brand name used for a family of low-power [[FPGA]]s produced by [[Lattice Semiconductor]]. Parts in the family are marketed with the "world's smallest FPGA" tagline, and are intended for use in portable and battery-powered devices (such as [[mobile phone]]s),&lt;ref name="lattice_ice_ultra-ultralite_201603"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latticesemi.com/en/Products/FPGAandCPLD/iCE40Ultra.aspx |title=iCE40 Ultra / UltraLite - Lattice Semiconductor |publisher=Lattice Semiconductor |accessdate=5 April 2016 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160308182806/http://www.latticesemi.com/en/Products/FPGAandCPLD/iCE40Ultra.aspx |archivedate=March 8, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; where they would be used to [[Computation offloading|offload]] tasks from the device's main [[Central processing unit|processor]] or [[System on chip|SoC]]. By doing so, the main processor and its [[peripheral]]s can enter a low-power state or be powered off entirely, potentially increasing battery life.

Lattice received the iCE brand as part of its 2011 acquisition of SiliconBlue Technologies.

The iCE brand was originally used by '''SiliconBlue Technologies Corporation''', a former [[Santa Clara, California]]-based [[fabless]] designer of [[integrated circuit]]s. SiliconBlue was a [[start-up company|start-up]] founded in 2005 by former employees of [[Actel]], [[Advanced Micro Devices|AMD]], Lattice, [[Monolithic Memories]], and [[Xilinx]].&lt;ref name="siliconblue_business-entity-info" /&gt;&lt;ref name="siliconblue_team"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.siliconbluetech.com/team.htm | title=SiliconBlue Team | publisher=SiliconBlue Technologies | date=2006 | accessdate=13 May 2016 | archive-date=6 December 2006 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061206215956/http://www.siliconbluetech.com/team.htm | dead-url=usurped}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most notable among the founders was [[John Birkner]], one of the inventors of [[programmable array logic]].&lt;ref name="computer-history-museum_pal-introduced"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.computerhistory.org/siliconengine/pal-user-programmable-logic-devices-introduced/ | title=1978: PAL User-Programmable Logic Devices Introduced | publisher=Computer History Museum | work=The Silicon Engine - A Timeline of Semiconductors in Computers | accessdate=13 May 2016 | archive-date=1 April 2016 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160401034348/http://www.computerhistory.org/siliconengine/pal-user-programmable-logic-devices-introduced/ | dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, SiliconBlue was funded with [[US Dollar|$]]16 million in [[Series A round|"Series A"]] capital,&lt;ref name="siliconblue_series-b-funding"&gt;{{cite press release | url=http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20081022005376/en/SiliconBlue-Secures-24-Million-Series-B-Funding | title=SiliconBlue Secures $24 Million in Series-B Funding | publisher=SiliconBlue Technologies | date=22 October 2008 | accessdate=13 May 2016 | archive-date=13 May 2016 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160513161404/http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20081022005376/en/SiliconBlue-Secures-24-Million-Series-B-Funding | dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in June 2008 announced the iCE65 L series of devices. The devices were to be [[Semiconductor fabrication|fabricated]] on [[TSMC]]'s [[65 nanometer|65{{thinsp}}nm]] [[CMOS]] [[Semiconductor node|process node]], which SiliconBlue claimed would provide reduced power consumption compared to contemporary FPGAs from other manufacturers.&lt;ref name="siliconblue_pr_ice65-announce" /&gt; In October 2008, SiliconBlue raised a further $24 million in [[Series B]] capital.&lt;ref name="siliconblue_series-b-funding"/&gt;

In 2009, the first iCE65 L devices were shipped to customers.&lt;ref name="siliconblue_pr_ice65l-ship"/&gt; SiliconBlue also registered ''SiliconBlue Technologies (Hong Kong) Limited'', which remains as a [[subsidiary]] of Lattice Semiconductor.&lt;ref name="siliconblue_hk-business-entity-info"&gt;{{URL|https://www.icris.cr.gov.hk/csci/cps_criteria.jsp|Company Particulars Search - ICRIS CSC Companies Registry}}, CR number 1330814.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lattice_sec_2016_10-k_exhibit-21.1"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/855658/000085565816000180/ex-211201510xk.htm | title=Exhibit 21.1 - Subsidiaries of the Registrant | publisher=US Securities and Exchange Commission | date=2 March 2016 | accessdate=13 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, the lowest-end of the iCE65 P devices was announced by SiliconBlue. The devices were claimed to be as much as 30% faster than iCE65 L devices while maintaining similar power consumption.&lt;ref name="siliconblue_pr_ice65p-announce"/&gt;&lt;ref name="siliconblue_ice65p-announce_eetimes"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.eetimes.com/document.asp?doc_id=1313688 | title=SiliconBlue unveils new series of FPGAs targeting mobile apps | work=EETimes | date=17 February 2010 | accessdate=13 May 2016 | archive-date=13 May 2016 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160513175945/http://www.eetimes.com/document.asp?doc_id=1313688 | dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the June of the same year, SiliconBlue closed a $15 million Series C funding round.&lt;ref name="siliconblue_series-c-funding"&gt;{{cite press release | url=http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20100607006486/en/SiliconBlue-Completes-15M-Series-Preferred-Stock-Financing | title=SiliconBlue Completes $15M Series C Preferred Stock Financing | publisher=BusinessWire | date=7 June 2010 | accessdate=13 May 2016 | archive-date=13 May 2016 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160513180330/http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20100607006486/en/SiliconBlue-Completes-15M-Series-Preferred-Stock-Financing | dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2011, SiliconBlue announced that it was to release new product families, code-named "Los Angeles" and "San Francisco," using a TSMC [[40 nanometer|40{{thinsp}}nm]] process node.&lt;ref name="siliconblue_ice40-preannounce"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.eetimes.com/document.asp?doc_id=1270781 | title=SiliconBlue tips FPGA move to 40-nm | work=EETimes | date=5 April 2011 | accessdate=13 May 2016 | author=Clarke, Peter | archive-date=13 May 2016 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160513181135/http://www.eetimes.com/document.asp?doc_id=1270781 | dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The production of devices on a 40{{thinsp}}nm process node was further confirmed in June 2011, when SiliconBlue received $18 million in Series D funding to bring 40{{thinsp}}nm devices to market.&lt;ref name="siliconblue_series-d-funding"&gt;{{cite press release | url=http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20110629005541/en/SiliconBlue-Raises-18-Million-Series-Funding | title=SiliconBlue Raises $18 Million in Series D Funding | publisher=BusinessWire | date=29 June 2011 | accessdate=13 May 2016 | archive-date=7 May 2012 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120507071631/http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20110629005541/en/SiliconBlue-Raises-18-Million-Series-Funding | dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="siliconblue_series-d-funding_techcrunch"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://techcrunch.com/2011/06/29/siliconblue-scores-18-million-in-series-d-funding/ | title=SiliconBlue Scores $18 Million in Series D Funding | work=TechCrunch | date=29 June 2011 | accessdate=13 May 2016 | author=Wauters, Robin | archive-date=10 March 2016 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160310073750/http://techcrunch.com/2011/06/29/siliconblue-scores-18-million-in-series-d-funding/ | dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The iCE40 product family was officially released in July 2011.&lt;ref name="siliconblue_ice40_launch"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.eetimes.com/document.asp?doc_id=1316702 | title=SiliconBlue launches 40nm mobileFPGA family (code name "Los Angeles") | work=EETimes | date=11 July 2011 | accessdate=13 May 2016 | author=Maxfield, Clive | archive-date=13 May 2016 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160513184640/http://www.eetimes.com/document.asp?doc_id=1316702 | dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 9 December 2011, SiliconBlue Technologies was acquired by Lattice Semiconductor in a $63.2 million cash buyout. As part of this buyout, Lattice received the iCE brand, manufacturing capabilities with TSMC, and a licence for various patents from Kilopass Technologies, including for its XPM [[one-time programmable]] (OTP) memory technology.&lt;ref name="lattice_sec_2012_10-k"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/855658/000085565812000035/a201110-k12x31x2011.htm | title=Form 10-K - Lattice Semiconductor Corporation | publisher=US Securities and Exchange Commission | year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|15, 8, 11}}

In April 2012, Lattice announced that the iCE65 families would be discontinued.&lt;ref name="lattice_pcn_08b-12" /&gt; The iCE40 LP and HX device families entered volume production the following month.&lt;ref name="lattice_pr_ice40-launch" /&gt; The iCE40 LP family won the [[Electronics Weekly#Elektra Awards|Elektra]] ''Digital Semiconductor Product of the Year'' award for 2012.&lt;ref name="elektra-awards_winners_2012" /&gt;

In July 2014, the iCE40 Ultra family was announced.&lt;ref name="lattice_pr_ice40-ultra-launch" /&gt;

In February 2015, Lattice launched the iCE40 UltraLite device family. The devices in this family are claimed to operate at 30% less power than those of unspecified competitors, and are claimed to be the world's smallest FPGAs, being available in 1.4×1.4{{thinsp}}mm [[Semiconductor package|packages]].&lt;ref name="lattice_pr_ice40-ultralite-launch" /&gt; The family won the 2015 Elektra ''Digital Semiconductor Product of the Year'' award.&lt;ref name="elektra-awards_winners_2015" /&gt;

In December 2016, Lattice launched the iCE40 UltraPlus device family. UltraPlus devices provide additional memory, additional processing elements, and support for newer interfaces and protocols compared to previous iCE40 Ultra/UltraLite devices.&lt;ref name="lattice_pr_ice40-ultraplus-launch"/&gt;&lt;ref name="eetimes_ice40-ultraplus-launch"/&gt;

== Architecture ==

[[File:Lattice iCE40LP-HX1K arch.png|235x225px|thumb|The architecture of iCE40 LP and HX1K devices.]]

{{seealso|FPGA#Technical design|FPGA#Architecture}}

iCE65 and iCE40 devices are constructed as an array of ''programmable logic blocks'' (PLBs), where a PLB is a block of eight [[Logic block|logic cells]]. Each logic cell consists of a four-input [[lookup table]] (sometimes called a 4-LUT or LUT4) with the output connected to a [[Flip-flop (electronics)#D flip-flop|D flip-flop]] (a 1-[[bit]] storage element). Within a PLB, each logic cell is connected to the following and preceding cell by carry logic, intended to improve the performance of constructs such as [[Adder (electronics)|adders]] and [[subtractor]]s. Interspersed with PLBs are blocks of [[Random access memory|RAM]], each four [[kilobit]]s in size. The number of RAM blocks varies depending on the device.&lt;ref name="lattice_ds_1040-v3.2" /&gt;{{rp|pages=. 2-1 to 2-3}}&lt;ref name="lattice_ds_ice65l-v2.42" /&gt;{{rp|pages=. 5–9}}

Compared to LUT6-based architectures (such as [[Xilinx]] 7-series devices and [[Altera]] [[Stratix]] devices), a LUT4-based device is unable to implement as-complex [[logic function]]s with the same number of logic cells. For example, a logic function with seven inputs could be implemented in eight LUT4s or two LUT6s.

iCE devices use volatile [[Static random-access memory|SRAM]] to store configuration data. As a result, the data must be loaded onto the device each time power is lost. All iCE devices support loading configuration data from a [[Programmer (hardware)|programmer]], from an external [[flash memory]] chip, or, with the exception of iCE40 ''LM'' devices,&lt;ref name="lattice_ice-lp-hx-lm_201603" /&gt; from a so-called NVCM, or non-volatile configuration memory. The NVCM is a one-time-programmable (OTP) memory integrated into the FPGA to negate the need for an external memory chip. Lattice claims that using the NVCM can improve design security by making [[reverse engineering]] more difficult.&lt;ref name="lattice_tn_1248-v2.8"&gt;{{cite book | title=Lattice TN1248 - iCE40 Programming and Configuration v2.8 | publisher=Lattice Semiconductor | year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[GPIO|I/O pins]] on iCE devices are separated into up to four banks. On some devices each bank has its own [[IC power-supply pin|power-supply pin]] (labelled V&lt;sub&gt;CCIO&lt;/sub&gt;), allowing the [[Logic level|logic-high]] voltage level of the I/O bank to be adjusted.&lt;ref name="lattice_ds_1040-v3.2" /&gt;{{rp|2-7}} Configurable I/O voltage levels are used by iCE devices to allow support for multiple interface standards with voltage levels between 1.8{{thinsp}}V and 3.3{{thinsp}}V, such as [[LVDS]].&lt;ref name="lattice_ds_1040-v3.2" /&gt;{{rp|3-1}} iCE65 devices also listed being able to support [[Stub Series Terminated Logic|SSTL]] through this method.&lt;ref name="lattice_ds_ice65l-v2.42" /&gt;{{rp|11}}

== Development ==

{{mainarticle|Hardware description language|Design flow (EDA)}}

iCE FPGAs, as with most FPGAs and [[CPLD]]s, are typically designed for using a hardware description language (or HDL), which describes an electronic circuit. Lattice Diamond, the [[integrated development environment|IDE]] provided by Lattice for developing on their FPGAs, supports the [[VHDL]] and [[Verilog]] languages, as well as the [[EDIF]] format.&lt;ref name="lattice_diamond_201603"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://latticesemi.com/en/Products/DesignSoftwareAndIP/FPGAandLDS/LatticeDiamond.aspx |title=Lattice Diamond - Lattice Semiconductor |publisher=Lattice Semiconductor |accessdate=8 April 2016 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160325211520/http://latticesemi.com/en/Products/DesignSoftwareAndIP/FPGAandLDS/LatticeDiamond.aspx |archivedate=March 25, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The details of a specific FPGA's [[bitstream]] format (which defines how the internal elements of the FPGA are connected and interact with each other) are not usually published by FPGA vendors. This means that, generally, an engineer creating a design for an FPGA must use the tools provided by the FPGA's manufacturer. 

In December 2015, at [[32C3]],&lt;ref name="32c3_icestorm"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://events.ccc.de/congress/2015/Fahrplan/events/7139.html |title=Schedule 32.

The toolchain is notable for being one of, if not the only, fully open-source toolchains for FPGA development. At the same December 2015 presentation, Wolf also demonstrated a [[RISC-V]] SoC design built using the open-source toolchain and running on an iCE40 ''HX8K'' device. As of April 2016, the toolchain supports iCE40 ''LP1K'', ''LP4K'', ''LP8K'', and ''HX'' devices.&lt;ref name="cliffordwolf_icestorm_201603"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clifford.at/icestorm/ |title=Project IceStorm |publisher=Clifford Wolf |date=17 January 2016 |accessdate=8 April 2016 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304202757/http://www.clifford.at/icestorm/ |archivedate=March 4, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== List of iCE devices ==

=== iCE65 (65 nm) ===

The ''iCE65'' name was used by SiliconBlue Technologies for the devices it designed for a 65{{thinsp}}nm process node. Following the acquisition of SiliconBlue in 2011, the name was used by Lattice Semiconductor until the family was discontinued in April 2012.&lt;ref name="lattice_pcn_08b-12"&gt;{{cite book | title=PCN# 08B-12: Notification of Intent to Discontinue the iCE65 Product Family | publisher=Lattice Semiconductor | year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''iCE65 L''' series of devices was intended for low-power applications and handheld devices. The series was first announced in mid 2008,&lt;ref name="siliconblue_pr_ice65-announce"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUS123525+02-Jun-2008+BW20080602 |title=SiliconBlue Pioneers New FPGA Technology for Handheld, Ultra-Low Power Applications |publisher=SiliconBlue Technologies |date=2 June 2008 |accessdate=9 April 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160409075954/https://www.reuters.com/article/idUS123525%2B02-Jun-2008%2BBW20080602 |archivedate=9 April 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and first shipped to volume customers in early 2009.&lt;ref name="siliconblue_pr_ice65l-ship"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eetimes.com/document.asp?doc_id=1311490 |title=SiliconBlue announces volume production shipments of iCE65 ultra-low-power FPGAs |publisher=EETimes |date=9 February 2009 |accessdate=6 April 2016 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160406165932/http://www.eetimes.com/document.asp?doc_id=1311490 |archivedate=April 6, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Information about a larger device in the series, the ''iCE65L16'', was listed on the SiliconBlue website in 2010,&lt;ref name="siliconblue_ice65l_product-page"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.siliconbluetech.com/products/devices/pro_iCE65_L_Series_mobileFPGA.aspx |title=SiliconBlue Technologes: iCE65 L-Series |publisher=SiliconBlue Technologies |accessdate=6 April 2016 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100220211548/http://www.siliconbluetech.com/products/devices/pro_iCE65_L_Series_mobileFPGA.aspx |archivedate=February 20, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but no mention is made in a 2012 revision of the L-series datasheet.&lt;ref name="lattice_ds_ice65l-v2.42"&gt;{{cite book | title=iCE65™ Ultra Low-Power mobileFPGA™ Family Datasheet v2.42 | publisher=Lattice Semiconductor | year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is unclear whether the device was ever produced commercially.

==== iCE65 P ====

The '''iCE65 P'''-series devices were marketed as a higher-performance version of the ''L-series'' devices, intended for use in display, memory, and [[SerDes|SERDES]] applications,&lt;ref name="lattice_ice65-product-table"&gt;{{cite book | title=The iCE65 mobileFPGA Family Product Table v1.1 | publisher=Lattice Semiconductor }}&lt;/ref&gt; and were announced in early 2010.&lt;ref name="siliconblue_pr_ice65p-announce"&gt;{{cite press release|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUS42638+15-Feb-2010+BW20100215 |title=SiliconBlue Enables Differentiated Mobile Broadband Products with New P-Series mobileFPGA Devices |publisher=Reuters |date=15 February 2010 |accessdate=6 April 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101117204221/https://www.reuters.com/article/idUS42638%2B15-Feb-2010%2BBW20100215 |archivedate=17 November 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="siliconblue_ice65p-announce_eetimes"/&gt; Three devices were listed as being part of the series but only one device, the lowest-end ''iCE65P04'', was fully specified. The latest datasheet for the family, published in 2011, lists the other two parts but does not give specifications.&lt;ref name="siliconblue_ds_ice65p-v1.31"&gt;{{cite book | title=iCE65™ P-Series Ultra Low-Power mobileFPGA™ Family v1.31 | publisher=SiliconBlue Technologies | date=22 April 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Whether these other two devices were ever commercially produced is unclear.

=== iCE40 (40 nm) ===

Lattice uses the ''iCE40'' name for its iCE-branded devices produced on a 40{{thinsp}}nm process node. The company has also used the codename ''"Los Angeles"'' in press releases. The iCE40 family was launched in July 2011 with iCE40 LP and HX parts,&lt;ref name="siliconblue_ice40_launch"/&gt; and was updated in July 2014 with the iCE40 Ultra parts&lt;ref name="lattice_pr_ice40-ultra-launch" /&gt;, in February 2015 with the iCE40 UltraLite parts,&lt;ref name="lattice_pr_ice40-ultralite-launch" /&gt; and in December 2016 with the iCE40 UltraPlus parts.&lt;ref name="lattice_pr_ice40-ultraplus-launch"/&gt;

The '''iCE40 Ultra''', '''UltraLite''', and '''UltraPlus''' devices are intended for applications with especially low limits on available space and power, such as in [[wearable technology]] and [[smart watches]].&lt;ref name="lattice_pr_ice40-ultra-launch"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://latticesemi.com/en/About/Newsroom/PressReleases/2015/20151201iCE40UltraWearable.aspx |title=Lattice Semiconductor Launches iCE40 Ultra™ Platform for Wearable Device Development |publisher=Lattice Semiconductor |date=1 December 2015 |accessdate=5 April 2016 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160331093934/http://latticesemi.com/en/About/Newsroom/PressReleases/2015/20151201iCE40UltraWearable.aspx |archivedate=March 31, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They are offered in [[Chip-scale package|chip-scale]], [[Ball grid array|BGA]], and [[Quad Flat No-leads package|QFN]] packages, with dimensions from 1.4×1.4{{thinsp}}mm to 7×7{{thinsp}}mm. All devices in family integrate one or two [[I²C]] hard cores, with ''Ultra'' and ''UltraPlus'' devices also including hard [[Serial peripheral interface|SPI]] bus cores and [[Digital signal processor|DSP]] blocks. ''UltraLite'' devices are claimed to operate at half the static current draw of ''Ultra'' devices (35{{thinsp}}μA compared to 71{{thinsp}}μA). Most devices in the family also include a [[Pulse-width modulation|PWM]] controller, intended to be used to drive [[Infrared lamp|IR]] or [[Light-emitting diode#RGB|RGB LED]]s.&lt;ref name="lattice_tn_1288-v1.1"&gt;{{cite book | title=TN 1288 - iCE40 LED Driver Usage Guide | publisher=Lattice Semiconductor | year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|5}}

Lattice launched the ''Ultra'' family in mid 2014,&lt;ref name="lattice_pr_ice40-ultra-launch" /&gt; and the ''UltraLite'' family in early 2015.&lt;ref name="lattice_pr_ice40-ultralite-launch"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://latticesemi.com/en/About/Newsroom/PressReleases/2015/201502UltraLite.aspx |title=Lattice Semiconductor’s New iCE40 UltraLite Device Enables OEMs to Accelerate Time-to-Market of Feature-Rich Mobile Devices |publisher=Lattice Semiconductor |date=3 February 2015 |accessdate=5 April 2016 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160331095525/http://latticesemi.com/en/About/Newsroom/PressReleases/2015/201502UltraLite.aspx |archivedate=March 31, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, the ''UltraLite'' family won the Elektra ''Digital Semiconductor Product of the Year'' award.&lt;ref name="elektra-awards_winners_2015"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elektraawards.co.uk/elektraawards2016/2015-winners |title=2015 Winners :: Elektra Awards |publisher=Electronics Weekly |accessdate=5 April 2016 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160405194156/http://www.elektraawards.co.uk/elektraawards2016/2015-winners |archivedate=April 5, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''iCE40 LP''' (low power) and '''LM''' (low power with [[Semiconductor intellectual property core#Hard cores|hard IP]]) parts are intended for use in battery-powered devices as [[hardware accelerator]]s and I/O [[port expander]]s, and for use in the same applications as ''iCE40 Ultra'' and ''UltraLite'' parts. Compared to the ''Ultra'' parts, ''LP'' and ''LM'' parts are available in a wider range of [[Footprint (electronics)|footprints]], offer a greater number of resources (I/O pins, embedded RAM, and logic elements), but consume more power.&lt;ref name="lattice_ice-lp-hx-lm_201603"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://latticesemi.com/Products/FPGAandCPLD/iCE40.aspx |title=iCE40 LP/HX/LM - Lattice Semiconductor |publisher=Lattice Semiconductor |accessdate=6 April 2016 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160325005933/http://latticesemi.com/Products/FPGAandCPLD/iCE40.aspx |archivedate=March 25, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''LP'' devices differ from the ''Ultra'' devices in that they do not include hard IP cores. Instead, any interface logic must be implemented in the FPGA fabric. This is generally less preferable, as so-called "soft cores" are less power-efficient than hard cores, and often are unable to operate at the same [[Clock rate|frequencies]]. A soft core also reduces the number of logic cells available to the application. ''LM'' devices integrate two I²C and two SPI hard cores, as well as two strobe generators. Most ''LP'' and ''LM'' devices integrate one or two phase-locked loops.

The families were launched in mid 2011 and entered volume production in mid 2012.&lt;ref name="siliconblue_ice40_launch"/&gt;&lt;ref name="lattice_pr_ice40-launch"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://latticesemi.com/en/About/Newsroom/PressReleases/2012/201205ProductionReleaseOfiCE40LosAngeles.aspx |title=Lattice Announces Production Release Of iCE40 Los Angeles LP-Series And HX-Series mobileFPGA Device Families |publisher=Lattice Semiconductor |date=8 May 2012 |accessdate=5 April 2016 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160331092704/http://latticesemi.com/en/About/Newsroom/PressReleases/2012/201205ProductionReleaseOfiCE40LosAngeles.aspx |archivedate=March 31, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They won the Elektra ''Digital Semiconductor Product of the Year'' award for 2012.&lt;ref name="elektra-awards_winners_2012"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elektraawards.co.uk/elektraawards2016/2012-winners |title=2012 Winners :: Elektra Awards |publisher=Electronics Weekly |accessdate=6 April 2016 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160406113851/http://www.elektraawards.co.uk/elektraawards2016/2012-winners |archivedate=April 6, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, it was announced that [[ZTE]] would use ''LM'' devices to provide [[sensor hub]] and infrared [[remote control]] functionality in its Star 2 smartphone.&lt;ref name="lattice_pr_zte-ice40-use"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/or-lattice-semiconductor-idUKnBw235326a+100+BSW20150623 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160406114428/http://uk.reuters.com/article/or-lattice-semiconductor-idUKnBw235326a+100+BSW20150623 | dead-url=yes | archive-date=6 April 2016 | title=ZTE Chooses Lattice Semiconductor for Feature Differentiation and Integration on Star 2 Smartphone | publisher=Reuters | date=23 June 2015 | accessdate=6 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''iCE40 HX''' devices are intended for high-performance applications. Compared to ''iCE40 LP'' and ''Ultra'' devices, they offer lower maximum [[Propagation delay#Electronics|propagation delay]] (7.30{{thinsp}}[[Nanosecond|ns]] versus 9.00–9.36{{thinsp}}ns),&lt;ref name="lattice_ds_1040-v3.2"&gt;{{cite book | title=DS1040 - iCE40 LP/HX Family Data Sheet v3.2 | publisher=Lattice Semiconductor | year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|3-13,3-15}} and more I/O pins. ''HX'' series devices consume significantly more static power and are available only in significantly larger footprints compared to ''Ultra'' and ''LP'' parts (7×7{{thinsp}}mm to 2×2{{thinsp}}cm). Similarly to the ''LP'' devices, ''HX'' parts do not provide hard IP cores, but do provide one or two phase-locked loops. Unlike other ''iCE40'' devices, the ''HX'' parts are also available in [[Quad Flat Package|QFP]] footprints.&lt;ref name="lattice_ice-lp-hx-lm_201603" /&gt;

The ''HX'' parts were launched in mid 2011 alongside the ''LP'' parts,&lt;ref name="siliconblue_ice40_launch"/&gt; and entered volume production in mid 2012.&lt;ref name="lattice_pr_ice40-launch" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2460">'''IEC Technical Specification 62700: DC Power supply for notebook computer''' is an [[International Electrotechnical Commission|IEC]] specification of a common standard for external [[laptop]] computer [[AC adapter]]s. Laptops and AC adapters following this standard will have interchangeable [[Power supply unit (computer)|power supplies]], which will enable easy reuse of used power supplies (thereby reducing [[electronic waste]]) and make buying a new compatible power supply for a laptop simpler.&lt;ref name="iec_news"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iec.ch/newslog/2013/nr2713.htm|title=Major milestone: single charger for notebook computers will significantly reduce e-waste|publisher=IEC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2013/12/one-charger-to-power-nearly-every-laptop-coming-from-standards-group/|title=IEC presses for single charger specification for notebook computers|publisher=EDN Europe}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The specification was published on {{date|2014-02-06}}.&lt;ref&gt;http://webstore.iec.ch/webstore/webstore.nsf/artnum/049207&lt;/ref&gt;

== Alternatives ==
Despite being an industry open organization with open participation, the standard has been criticized by some for not being openly available for review. Some alternatives include:
* IEEE has a proposed standard [[Universal Power Adapter for Mobile Devices]] for laptops and other devices.
* The USB Promoters Group's [[Universal Serial Bus#PD|USB Power Delivery]] ("PD") specification supports up to 100&amp;nbsp;W, and is intended to be able to power laptops.
* [[EmPower (aircraft power adapter)]] is intended for passenger aircraft.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3367">ISO 24617-1:2009, '''ISO-TimeML''' is the [[International Organization for Standardization]] [[ISO/TC37]] standard for time and event markup and annotation.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tc37sc4.org/new_doc/iso_tc37_sc4_N385_wg2_iso-timeml_provo2007_beamer_utf8.pdf. Retrieved 2010-5-3.&lt;/ref&gt; The scope is standardization of principles and methods relating to the annotation of temporal events in the contexts of electronic documentation and language.

==Objectives of ISO-TimeML==
The goals of ISO-TimeML are to provide a common model for the creation and use of temporal and event annotation, as a means of managing time-related data within documents, and to enable later categorization and data extraction with use of this meta-data.

==History of ISO-TimeML==
ISO-TimeML was presented to the ISO for consideration as a standard in August 2007. In this presentation, the preliminaries of ISO-TimeML were outlined, and potential applications were examined.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tc37sc4.org/new_doc/iso_tc37_sc4_N385_wg2_iso-timeml_provo2007_beamer_utf8.pdf. Retrieved 2010-5-15.&lt;/ref&gt; In the following year, revisions were made to ISO-TimeML as the standard transitioned from a New Project (NP) to a Working Project (WP).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tc37sc4.org/new_doc/iso_tc37_sc4_N471_rev01_SemAFTime_meetingNotes_Marrakech2008.pdf|title=Invincible Internet Security - Internet Addiction|author=|date=|website=www.tc37sc4.org|accessdate=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ISO-TimeML voting period began in October 2008 and was approved as an international standard by March 2009.

==Current stage==
{{Empty section|date=July 2010}}

==ISO-TimeML as one of the members of the ISO/TC37 family of standards==

The ISO/TC37 standards are currently elaborated as high level [[specifications]] and deal with [[word segmentation]] (ISO 24614), [[annotations]] (ISO 24611 a.k.a. MAF, ISO 24612 a.k.a. LAF, ISO 24615 a.k.a. SynAF, and ISO 24617-1 a.k.a. SemAF/Time), [[feature structures]] (ISO 24610), multimedia containers (ISO 24616 a.k.a. MLIF), and [[lexicons]] (ISO 24613 a.k.a. [[Lexical Markup Framework|LMF]]). These standards are based on low level specifications dedicated to constants, namely data categories (revision of [[ISO 12620]]), [[language codes]] ([[ISO 639]]), [[scripts codes]] ([[ISO 15924]]), [[country codes]] ([[ISO 3166]]) and [[Unicode]] ([[ISO 10646]]).

The two level organization forms a coherent family of standards with the following common and simple rules:
* the high level specification provides structural elements that are adorned by the standardized constants;
* the low level specifications provide standardized constants as metadata.

==Work group members==
Joint work between ISO/TC 37/SC 4/WG 2 (TDG 3) and the TimeML
Working Group that was agreed on at the TDG 3 and LIRICS Working Group
Meeting, USC/ISI, Marina del Rey, CA, U.S.A., 2006-04-20/21/22.

'''Igor Aleksander''' [[Royal Academy of Engineering|FREng]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=List of Fellows|url=http://www.raeng.org.uk/about-us/people-council-committees/the-fellowship/list-of-fellows}}&lt;/ref&gt; (born 26 January 1937) is an [[emeritus professor]] of Neural Systems Engineering in the Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering at [[Imperial College London]]. He worked in [[artificial intelligence]] and [[neural networks]] and designed the world's first neural pattern recognition system in the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.npg.org.uk/live/search/person.asp?LinkID=mp10120 Igor Aleksander 1937–), Head of Intelligent and Interactive Systems at Imperial College], retrieved 17 April 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and work==
Aleksander was educated in [[Italy]] and graduated from the [[University of the Witwatersrand]] in [[South Africa]], arriving in the UK in the late 1950s, intending to become a research student under [[Colin Cherry]]. Instead he found work with [[Standard Telephones and Cables]], later joining [[Queen Mary, University of London|Queen Mary College]] where he gained a PhD, subsequently becoming a lecturer there in 1961. He moved to the [[University of Kent]] in 1968 as a reader in Electronics and then to [[Brunel University]] as professor in 1974. In 1984 he became professor at [[Imperial College London]] as professor of the Management of Information Technology.&lt;ref name="imh" /&gt; He was Head of Electrical Engineering and Gabor Professor of Neural Systems Engineering at Imperial College from 1988 to his retirement in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/pls/portallive/docs/1/548014.PDF | title = Council: Staff Matters | publisher = Imperial College London | date = 2002-10-18 | accessdate = 2009-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was elected Fellow of the [[Royal Academy of Engineering]] (1988), and he served as Pro-rector of External Relations at Imperial College (1997). In 2005 he presented the [[Bernard Price Memorial Lecture]].

His work centred on the modelling capability of [[artificial neural network]]s. He devised neuromodels of the [[visual system]] in primates, visuo-verbal system in humans, the effect of anaesthetics on [[awareness]], and [[artificial consciousness]]. He inspired the engineering design  of one of the first stand alone neural pattern recognition systems, the WISARD (anonym for Wilkie Stonham Aleksander’s Recognition Device) which was named after the co-inventors Bruce Wilkie, John Stonham and Igor Aleksander. This Brunel University prototype WISARD was commercially developed and marketed by Computer Recognition Systems, Wokingham, under the trade name of ’CRS WISARD’ in 1984. After this, the further developments of this system do not appear to have been documented. A popular link for WISARD is that of “the wisard pattern recognition machine” at the Winton Gallery, British Science Museum.

Aleksander received an honorary degree in Computer Engineering from [[University of Palermo]] in Jul 2011.

The '''International Nuclear Library Network (INLN)''', coordinated by the [http://www.iaea.org/OurWork/ST/NE/Library/ IAEA Library], i.e. the Library of the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]], is a consortium of nuclear libraries and knowledge centres. The Network seeks to promote the exchange of nuclear information and to strengthen strategic partnerships amongst members. The underlying strategy is twofold: first, whenever a new partner joins the network, the shared information base is enlarged; and second, the larger the information base becomes, the more attractive the network is. The 37 nuclear libraries coming from 27 countries that participate in the coalition have managed to enhance their information pool and extend their services to cover nuclear information and knowledge needs on a global scale.

== History ==

The International Nuclear Library Network was founded in 2005 by the IAEA Library and the [[Atomic Energy of Canada Limited]] (AECL) Library. In its initial years, it counted a total of five members (in addition to the initiators, the [[National Atomic Energy Commission]] of Argentina, the [[Turkish Atomic Energy Agency]] and the [[Institute of Nuclear Physics of Uzbekistan Academy of Science]]. In 2006, the [[Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation]] (ANSTO) also joined the network. In 2007, the INLN welcomed four new members: the [[China Nuclear Information Centre]], the [[Nigerian Nuclear Regulatory Authority]], the [[Obninsk State Technical University for Nuclear Power Engineering]] in the Russian Federation, and the [[Russian Association of Nuclear Science and Education]] (RANSE), thus increasing the membership to ten participants. In 2008, at the meeting of INLN Members and prospective members, during the 34th [[International Nuclear Information System]] (INIS) Liaison Officers Meeting in Vienna, a large number of nuclear libraries from around the world expressed their interest and subsequently joined the INLN: the [[Belarus INIS Center, Chair of Ecological Information Systems]], the [[Nuclear Research Institute Rez plc of Czech Republic]], the [[Egyptian Atomic Energy Authority]] (EAEA), the [[Ghana Atomic Energy Commission Library]], the [[Bhabha Atomic Research Centre]] (BARC) of India, the [[Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland]], the [[Japan Atomic Energy Agency]] (JAEA), the [[Instituto Nacional de Investigaciones Nucleares]] (ININ), [[Centro de Información y Documentación Nuclear]] (CIDN) of Mexico, the [[Centre National de l' Energie des Sciences et des Techniques Nucléaires]] (CNESTEN) of Morocco, the Korea Atomic Energy Research Institute (KAERI) at the [[University of Science and Technology (South Korea)]], the [[Vinca Nuclear Institute]] of Serbia,  the Centre National des Sciences et Technologies Nucléaires [http://www.cnstn.rnrt.tn (CNSTN)] of Tunisia. In November of the same year, the Library Network of the [[National Nuclear Energy Commission|Brazilian Nuclear Energy Commission]] (Comissão Nacional de Energia Nuclear – CNEN), consisting of seven nuclear libraries, became an INLN official member. In January 2009, the [[Commissariat à l'Énergie Atomique]] (CEA) - Centre de Saclay - Centre de Ressources Documentaires joined the Network, while in 2010, the [[National Atomic Energy Commission]], the [[Norwegian Radiation Protection Authority]], and the [[Pakistan Institute of Nuclear Science &amp; Technology]] decided to become INLN members. The Nuclear Energy Regulatory Agency of Indonesia - [[Badan Pengawas Tenaga Nuklir]] and the New Zealand [[Institute of Environmental Science and Research]] – National Radiation Laboratory are the newest members, raising the total number of Nuclear Libraries/Information Centres participating in the INLN to 37.

== Structure and function ==

The International Nuclear Library Network (INLN) represents a coalition of nuclear libraries. It is designed to be an Internet-based [[library]] and [[information system]]. Its information portal is hosted by the IAEA Library and it is supported by nuclear libraries and knowledge centres worldwide; it is developed and maintained in a decentralized manner, in accordance with agreed standards. It links not only bibliographic information to full-text and audio-visual information, but also librarians, library clients and researchers to the appropriate information. Moreover, the network links nuclear information workers to each other, forming a strong community of practice, sharing knowledge, best practices and lessons learned. Among the services that INLN members provide to each other are: research services, [[interlibrary loans]], document delivery, current awareness services and any other services participating libraries wish to provide other libraries. The website offers a landing page hosting access to members' online catalogues. 
The success of INLN is based on its democratic structure: all participating libraries are equal partners, valued according to what they bring as practitioners in terms of information and their willingness to share, rather than on predetermined hierarchical or status levels. The actual work of the network focuses on concrete actions, bringing the right information in the right format at the right time to the right place.

== Membership ==

[[Image:Inlnservices.jpg|thumb|right|INLN services]]
Membership in the INLN is open to States who are Members of the [[IAEA]] and to [[UN]] organizations. Other interested international, intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations may also join, subject to agreement of the INLN Members. Each INLN Member has the same rights and responsibilities.
To apply for INLN membership, an official request is to be made by the appropriate library to the [https://www.iaea.org/resources/library/ IAEA Library], which is the coordinating library of the Network. If the requesting library is located in an IAEA Member State or belongs to an UN organization, the IAEA Library as the coordinating library will make modifications to the INLN website and inform the applicant and other participants about a new member. 
For other prospective participants, the coordinating library will seek approval from all existing member libraries/knowledge centres. The Coordinator, after receiving the approval from current members, will inform the applicant and the members of the outcome, and proceed with updating the INLN website.

The '''International Safety Equipment Association''' (ISEA) is a [[trade association]] of manufacturers of [[personal protective equipment]] and other safety equipment, with its offices in [[Arlington, Virginia]].  More than 100 companies are members. The ISEA is the secretariat organization for several [[American National Standards Institute]] [[technical standards]] for products such as [[high visibility clothing]], eye protection, [[hard hat]]s, chemical and dust protection, [[Glove|hand protection]], and others; formerly this role was filled by the [[American Society of Safety Engineers]].

The organization was founded in 1933 as the '''Industrial Safety Equipment Association'''. It adopted its current name in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;The Tube &amp; Pipe Journal: TPJ., Volume 11 Croydon Group, 2000, page 17&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2002 it has had a Web site accessible to the public and member organizations.&lt;ref&gt;ENR, Volume 249 Issue 13-19, McGraw Hill, 2002, page 309&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to technical standards development and market research, the organization also provides representation of the safety products industry to the American government.

A '''jockey box''' is an insulated container containing ice and water, as well as a long coil of hollow tubing. The device is used to cool [[Drink|beverages]] being served on tap in temporary locations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Outdoor Dispensing, Jockey Box, Foam|url=https://www.homebrewtalk.com/forum/threads/outdoor-dispensing-jockey-box-foam.413435/|website=HomeBrewTalk.com - Beer, Wine, Mead, &amp; Cider Brewing Discussion Community.|accessdate=28 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One end of the coiled tube in the box is fitted to the external supply of the beverage to be served (often moved from the supply container by [[Partial pressure|gas pressure]], as in the case of [[Keg beer|beer in kegs]], and the other end is attached to taps for serving the beverage, which are often integrated into the box itself. Filling the jockey box with ice and water cools the coiled tubing, and when the beverage flows through the tube, the beverage is cooled to a temperature just above [[Freezing|freezing]], even if it was at [[room temperature]] before it entered the box. This allows cold drinks to be served on tap in temporary and outdoor venues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=All About Jockey Boxes|url=https://www.micromatic.com/draft-keg-beer-edu/about-jockey-boxes-aid-118.html|website=www.micromatic.com|accessdate=28 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Apart from the coil and taps, the jockey box resembles a [[cool box]]. Some jockey boxes force the liquid through a solid cold plate rather than a coil of tubing&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Build an Electric Draft Jockey Box: Projects - Brew Your Own|url=https://byo.com/project/build-an-electric-draft-jockey-box-projects/|website=Brew Your Own|accessdate=28 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; (see Alternative Portable Cooler Dispensers below).

A [[glove compartment]] is also sometimes referred to as a "jockey box," especially in the U.S. Upper Rocky Mountain states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jockey Box|url=https://www.waywordradio.org/jockey-box/|website=A Way with Words|accessdate=28 January 2018|date=25 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alternative Portable Cooler Dispensers==

In the coil cooler, a stainless steel coil is covered with water and ice, in which the liquid is made run through. At the contact with the cold coil, the beverage becomes cold.  
On the flip side, the cold plate works making the beverage run across an ice covered aluminum cold plate. When the plate makes contact with the ice, the plate become cold provoking the liquid that runs over it becomes cold too.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cold Plate Coolers vs. Coil Coolers|url=https://www.micromatic.com/beer-questions/party-cooler-coil-cold-plate|website=www.micromatic.com|accessdate=28 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A portable ice maker and water dispenser is a device that produces ice, and release chill water by a small in-house generator. Depending on the size, some of them require a water line connection, but most of them only needs to have water deposited in its container.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Portable Ice Makers|url=https://chillicemaker.com/%20portable%20ice%20maker/|accessdate=28 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is a '''list of megaprojects'''. "Megaprojects are temporary endeavours (i.e. projects) characterized by: large investment commitment, vast complexity (especially in organizational terms), and long-lasting impact on the economy, the environment, and society".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brookes|first=Naomi J.|last2=Locatelli|first2=Giorgio|date=2015-10-01|title=Power plants as megaprojects: Using empirics to shape policy, planning, and construction management|url=http://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/90267/|journal=Utilities Policy|volume=36|pages=57–66|doi=10.1016/j.jup.2015.09.005}}&lt;/ref&gt; The number of such projects is so large that the list may never be fully completed.

==Definitions==
[[Megaprojects]] may be defined as:
* Projects that cost more than US$1 billion and attract a large amount of public attention because of substantial impacts on [[communities]], [[Natural environment|environment]], and [[budgets]].
* Projects can also be "initiatives that are physical, very expensive, and public".&lt;ref name="altshuler"&gt;{{cite book |last=Altshuler |first=Alan |last2=Luberoff |first2=David |title=Mega-Projects: The Changing Politics of Urban Public Investment |publisher=Brookings Institution Press |date=30 April 2003 |isbn=978-0-8157-0129-3 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UZY5vCO06NQC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Megaprojects require care in the project development process to reduce any possible [[optimism bias]] and [[strategic misrepresentation]]. Examples of megaprojects include bridges, tunnels, highways, railways, airports, seaports, power plants, dams, wastewater projects, [[Special Economic Zone]]s (SEZ), oil and natural gas extraction projects, public buildings, information technology systems, aerospace projects, and weapons systems.

This list identifies a wide variety of examples of major historic and contemporary projects that meet one or both megaproject criteria identified above.

==Aerospace projects==

* [[Airbus A380]], a [[Double-deck aircraft|double-deck]], [[wide-body]], four-engine jet airliner manufactured by [[Airbus]].
* [[Antonov An-225]] is the longest and heaviest aircraft in service. Only one unit was ever completed.
* [[Boeing B-29 Superfortress]], the first nuclear bomber, which cost 50% more than the development of the bombs in the [[Manhattan Project]].
* [[Boeing B-52 Stratofortress]], with 6 decades of service as a strategic nuclear bomber, it is one of the largest military aircraft ever built. Every other bomber produced in the US after the B-52 have been megaprojects; however, it has not been replaced nor will it be in the foreseeable future.
* [[Boeing 2707]] and [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]] [[Lockheed L-2000|L-2000]] [[supersonic aircraft]] projects, initiated in 1963 via a US government-funded competition to build the United States' first Supersonic Transport (SST), prototypes never built, ultimately canceled due to political, environmental and economic reasons in 1971.
* [[Boeing 747]], a [[wide-body aircraft|wide-body]] commercial airliner first produced in 1970, often referred to by the nickname ''[[Wide-body aircraft|Jumbo Jet]]'',&lt;ref name="bbcnews_747house"&gt;{{cite news|title=Woman to build house out of 747|work=BBC News|date=20 April 2006|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/4926216.stm|accessdate=30 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sutter"&gt;{{cite book|last=Sutter|first=Joe|last2=Spenser|first2=Jay|title=747: Creating the World's First Jumbo Jet and Other Adventures from a Life in Aviation|publisher=Collins|date=1 May 2007|isbn=0-06-088242-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; is among the world's most recognizable aircraft with uses for long distance passenger transport, cargo, the [[Air Force One|US President's official shuttle plane]], and as NASA's [[Shuttle Carrier Aircraft]].
* [[Boeing 787]], made in the United States with local and globally sourced parts, is the first major aircraft to be made largely out of [[composite materials]]&lt;ref name="787_flyingredef"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Norris, G. |author2=Thomas, G. |author3=Wagner, M. |author4=Forbes Smith, C.  |lastauthoramp=yes|title=Boeing 787 Dreamliner – Flying Redefined|publisher=Aerospace Technical Publications International|year=2005|isbn=0-9752341-2-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Concorde]], a supersonic passenger airliner, a product of an Anglo-French government treaty that combined the manufacturing efforts of [[Aérospatiale]] and the [[British Aircraft Corporation]], first flown in 1969, Concorde entered service in 1976 and continued commercial flights for twenty-seven years.
* [[Convair B-58 Hustler]], an all-weather, high altitude supersonic bomber with a fixed delta wing and 4 engines. The Hustler was operational from 1960 to 1970 in the US Air Force's [[Strategic Air Command]] for the deployment of up to 5 gravity nuclear weapons.
* [[Eurofighter Typhoon]], a twin-engine [[canard (aeronautics)|canard]]–[[delta wing]] [[multirole combat aircraft|multirole]] [[fighter aircraft]] designed and built by a consortium of three separate partner companies -- [[Alenia Aeronautica]], [[BAE Systems]], and [[Airbus Defence and Space]]—working through a holding company, [[Eurofighter GmbH]], that was formed in 1986.&lt;ref name="eurofighter_history"&gt;{{cite web|title=A History of the Programme| publisher=EuroFighter.com|url=http://www.eurofighter.com/eurofighter-typhoon/programme/history.html|accessdate=30 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[General Dynamics F-111 Aardvark]], a twin [[turbofan]], multi-role supersonic fighter-bomber. It was active from 1967 to 2010 in the US and Australia with various roles, including [[nuclear deterrence]] and [[electronic warfare]]. Initially, it was meant to replace a wide breadth of aircraft in the US Navy and Air Force, but due to cost and suitability issues, it only was ever used as a bomber and jammer aircraft, though it performed very well in these roles.
* [[General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon]], a single seat, single turbofan, high performance, multi-role fighter. It is by far one of the most popular and most common jet fighters in the world, active from 1978 to present with [[General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon operators|operators in 26 countries]].
* [[Lockheed C-5 Galaxy]] was the largest and heaviest aircraft of any kind for over a decade (1970 to 1982). This military cargo plane has the dubious distinction of being the first development program with a billion dollar cost overrun.&lt;ref name="Irving"&gt;Irving, Clive.

* [[Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II|F-35 Lightning II]], a fifth-generation, single-seat, single-engine [[Stealth aircraft|stealth]] [[Multirole combat aircraft|multirole fighter]] manufactured by Lockheed Martin. Variants of the F-35 are planned to replace five classes of combat aircraft that are presently in use with roles as varied as [[close air support]], [[tactical bombing]], and [[Aerial warfare|air defense]] missions.
* [[Northrop Grumman B-2 Spirit]], also known as the ''Stealth Bomber'', a US [[heavy bomber]] with "low observable" [[stealth aircraft|stealth]]. Total program cost including development, engineering, and testing averaged $2.1&amp;nbsp;billion per aircraft in 1997.&lt;ref name=Gao&gt;[https://fas.org/man/gao/nsiad97181.htm "B-2 Bomber: Cost and Operational Issues Letter Report, 14 August 1997, GAO/NSIAD-97-181."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150408233322/https://fas.org/man/gao/nsiad97181.htm |date=8 April 2015 }} ''United States General Accounting Office'' (GAO).

* [[Tupolev Tu-160]], the world's largest and heaviest combat aircraft, the world's largest supersonic aircraft, and the largest variable-sweep aircraft ever built. (The [[North American XB-70 Valkyrie]] had a higher empty weight and maximum speed but never entered production.)
* [[Chengdu J-20]], a [[Fifth generation jet fighter|fifth-generation]], stealth, twin-engine fighter aircraft prototype developed by Chengdu Aircraft Industry Group for the Chinese People's Liberation Army Air Force (PLAAF).

==Disaster cleanup==
[[File:Construction of the new sarcophagus in Chernobyl.jpg|thumb|Construction of the [[Chernobyl New Safe Confinement|new confinement structure]] for the nuclear reactor that [[Chernobyl disaster|melted down at Chernobyl]] in [[Ukraine]].]][[File:Valdez Trash Pile.jpg|thumb|Bags of oily waste are piled up during the cleanup of the [[Exxon Valdez oil spill]] in 1989.]]
While most megaprojects are planned and undertaken with careful forethought, some are undertaken out of necessity after a [[natural disaster]] occurs. There have also been a few [[Anthropogenic hazard|man-made disasters]].
* The [[Chernobyl New Safe Confinement]] is being built to enclose the #4 reactor that was destroyed in the [[Chernobyl disaster]] of 1986.
* The [[Fukushima disaster cleanup]] is ongoing, and includes the removal of spent nuclear fuel stored at the site of the [[Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster|2011 Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster]].
* Cleaning up the [[Deepwater Horizon oil spill|''Deepwater Horizon'' oil spill]], [[Exxon Valdez oil spill|''Exxon Valdez'' oil spill]], and [[AZF (factory)|AZF chemical factory explosion]] were megaprojects.
* Storing nuclear waste at [[Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository]] is designed to prevent a disaster from leaking nuclear waste.
* Many [[hurricane]]s and [[typhoon]]s have caused extensive damage and required large cleanup efforts, the largest of which included projects that targeted the damaged infrastructure. The [[list of costliest Atlantic hurricanes]] covers the ones in the Atlantic region, including [[Hurricane Katrina]] from 2005.
* Many earthquakes (and resultant [[tsunami]]s) have caused enough damage to infrastructure that enormous projects were undertaken. The [[1994 Northridge earthquake]], the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami]], and the [[2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami]] are some of the most notorious and recent events that led to a megaproject.
* [[List of floods|Flooding]] is the cause of many disasters. Some have caused enough damage that a megaproject would be used to recover. The [[Great Mississippi Flood of 1927]] and the [[2011 Mississippi River floods]] are examples.
* Volcano eruptions rarely affect major industrial area, but the cleanup and recovery from the [[1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens]] in rural [[Washington (state)|Washington State]] was of megaproject proportions.
* The [[rescue and recovery effort after the September 11 attacks]] on the [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|World Trade Center]].
* Major restoration was necessary after the destruction caused by [[World War I]] and [[World War II|II]], some of which was paid for by [[World War I reparations|German reparations for World War I]] and for [[German reparations for World War II|World War II]].

These construction standards will be applied for the two-way four-lane highway, with the speed of 100&amp;nbsp;km/h according to the design, and the construction period of 4 years. The highway stretches from south to the north across the mountains. In technical terms it is very demanding, and the construction is very challenging. Bridges and tunnels make up to about 60% of the entire route. In recent years, it is the largest infrastructure project in Montenegro, and the implementation of the project is very challenging.

The '''Motorola A910''' is a [[Flip (form)|clamshell]] mobile phone from [[Motorola]], which uses MontaVista [[Linux]] as the [[operating system]].

Motorola started selling this phone in the first quarter of the year 2006. Utilizing a balanced Linux-[[Java (software platform)|Java]] operating system and [[Wi-Fi]] connectivity, the Motorola A910 surpasses its predecessors with user-friendly features, everything from text messaging to email management. It is also the only clamshell phone from Motorola with Wi-Fi, as well as the only non-touchscreen Motorola with Wi-Fi in [[Europe]].

== Features ==
The phone is supplied with a number of applications including a [[Post Office Protocol|POP]] and [[IMAP]] email client, Opera web browser, calendar and a viewer for PDF and Microsoft Office files. Calendar and address book can be synchronized with a [[Microsoft Exchange Server|Microsoft Exchange]] or [[SyncML]] server. The phone has a 1.3 [[megapixel]] camera with Self Portrait Viewfinder External Display and photo lighting, recording still and video images. [[RealPlayer]] is included to play sound audio files and streamed audio and video. The phone has 48 [[megabyte]]s of internal flash memory for storing user data and a slot for a [[microSD]] card, which supports additional 2 GB of storage. Both [[Bluetooth]] and USB are provided for communication with another computer. Character entry is made by the keypad interface.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gsmarena.com/motorola_a910-1233.php GSM Arena] Full phone specifications&lt;/ref&gt;

==Linux enthusiasts==
This phone is popular with Linux enthusiasts. It is able to establish an Ethernet connection between the phone and another computer over [[USB]], [[Bluetooth]] or [[Wi-Fi]]. One can then [[telnet]] to the phone and be presented with a [[Bash (Unix shell)|bash]] prompt. From the prompt one can, for example, mount a NFS drive(s) on the phone. The underlying operating system, Motorola EZX is Linux based, its kernel is open source. With the source code hosted on ''opensource.motorola.com'', it is possible to recompile and replace the kernel for this operating system. However Motorola did not publish a software development kit for native applications. Instead, they are expecting third party programs to be written in [[Java Platform, Micro Edition|Java ME]]. The [[OpenEZX]] website is dedicated to providing free opensource software for this phone and others using the same OS.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6988">{{Nanoelec}}A '''nanoradio''' (also called carbon nanotube radio) is a nanotechnology acting as a radio transmitter and receiver by using [[carbon nanotube]]s. One of the first nanoradios was constructed in 2007 by researchers under [[Alex Zettl]] at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] where they successfully transmitted an audio signal.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.berkeley.edu/news/media/releases/2007/10/31_NanoRadio.shtml|title=10.31.2007 - Single nanotube makes world's smallest radio|website=www.berkeley.edu|access-date=2016-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the small size, nanoradios can have several possible applications such as radio function in the bloodstream.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Regis|first=Ed|date=2009-01-01|title=The World's Smallest Radio|url=http://www.nature.com/scientificamerican/journal/v300/n3/full/scientificamerican0309-40.html|journal=Scientific American|language=en|volume=300|issue=3|pages=40–45|doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0309-40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The first observation of a nanoradio can be accredited to a Japanese physicist [[Sumio Iijima]] in 1991 who saw a "a luminous discharge of electricity" coming from a carbon nanotube on a graphite electrode.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; On October 31, 2007, a team of researchers under Alex Zettl at the University of California, Berkeley created one of the first nanoradios.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Their experiment consisted of placing a multilayered nanotube placed on a silicon electrode and connecting it to a counter electrode through a wire and a DC battery. Both the electrode and nanotube were also put in a vacuum of about 10&lt;sup&gt;−7&lt;/sup&gt; Torr.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www2.lbl.gov/tt/publications/2431.pdf|title=Nanotube Radio|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=K. Jensen, J. Weldon, H. Garcia, and A. Zettl|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; They then placed the apparatus into a [[High-resolution transmission electron microscopy|high-resolution transmission electron microscope]] to document the movement of the nanotube. They observed the nanoradio vibrating and transmitted a song called "Layla" by Eric Clapton.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Chemistry World|title=Real single nanotube radio plays Layla|date=2007-11-01|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htpCovoRtn0|accessdate=2016-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; After some minor adjustments, the team was able to transmit and receive signals from a couple meters across the laboratory;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; however, the initial audio receptions from the radio were scratchy which Zettl believed was due to the lack of a better vacuum.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Properties ==
The small size, roughly 10 nanometers wide and hundreds of nanometers long, and composition of nanoradios provide several distinct properties. The small size of nanoradios enables electrons to pass through without much friction, making nanoradios efficient conductors. Nanoradios can also come in different sizes; they can be double-walled, tripled-walled and multi-walled. Aside from the different sizes, nanoradios can also take different shapes such as bent, straight or [[toroid]]al. Common among all nanoradios is how relatively strong they are. The resistance can be attributed to the strength of the bonds between carbon atoms.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Function ==
The fundamental parts of a radio are the antenna, tuner, demodulator and amplifier. Carbon nanotubes are special in that they can function as these parts without the need of extra circuitry.

=== Antenna ===
The nanoradio is small enough for electromagnetic signals to mechanically vibrate the nanoradio. The nanoradio essentially acts as an antenna by vibrating with the same frequency as the signal from incoming electromagnetic waves; this is in contrast with traditional radio antennas, which are generally stationary.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The nanotube can vibrate in high frequencies, from "thousands to millions of times per second." &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Tuner ===
The nanoradio can also function as a tuner by extending or reducing the length of the nanotube; doing so changes the resonance frequency at which it vibrates, enabling the radio to tune into specific frequencies. The length of the nanotube can be extended by pulling the tip with a positive electrode and can be shortened by removing atoms off the tip.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Consequently, changing the length is permanent and can't be reversed; however, the method of varying the electric field can also affect the frequency that the nanoradio responds without being permanent.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Amplifier ===
As a benefit of the microscopic size and needle-like shape, the nanoradio functions naturally as an [[amplifier]]. The nanoradio exhibits [[Field electron emission|field emission]], in which a small voltage emits a flow of electrons; due to this, a small electromagnetic wave would produce a large flow of electrons, amplifying the signal.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Demodulator ===
[[Demodulation]] is essentially the separation of the information signal from the carrier wave.  When the nanoradio vibrates in sync with the carrier wave, the nanoradio responds only to the information signal and ignores the [[carrier wave]]; and so, the nanoradio can act as a demodulator without the need of circuitry.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Medical Application ==
Currently, chemotherapy uses chemicals that harm not only cancerous cells, but also healthy ones since they are put into the blood stream. Nanoradios can be used to prevent damage to healthy cells by remotely communicating with the radio to release drugs and specifically target cancerous cells. Nanoradios can also be injected into individual cells to release certain chemicals, enabling repair of specific cells.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Nanoradios can also be used to monitor insulin levels of diabetes patients and use that information to release a drug or chemical.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www2.technologyreview.com/news/409595/tr10-nanoradio/2/|title=TR10: NanoRadio - MIT Technology Review|last=Service|first=Robert F.|newspaper=MIT Technology Review|access-date=2016-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Complications ==
The implanting of nanoradios in the body are currently not feasible due to power dissipation. The nanoradio radiates about 4.5 x 10&lt;sup&gt;−27&lt;/sup&gt;  W of electromagnetic power; however, much of this power would be loss when passing through the body. The amount of energy input can be increased, but would generate too much heat in the body, posing a safety risk. Other issues include the difficulty of constructing a nanoradio due to its nanoscale size, requiring quantum models and precision to manufacture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Diaz|first=R.

'''Online hotel reservations''' are a popular method for booking [[hotel]] rooms. [[Travel]]ers can book rooms on a computer by using [[Transport Layer Security|online security]] to protect their privacy and financial information and by using several online [[travel agent]]s to compare prices and facilities at different hotels.

Prior to the [[Internet]], travelers could write, telephone the hotel directly, or use a travel agent to make a reservation. Nowadays, online travel agents have pictures of hotels and rooms, information on prices and deals, and even information on local [[resorts]].  Many also allow [[review]]s of the traveler to be recorded with the online travel agent.

Online hotel reservations are also helpful for making last minute travel arrangements. Hotels may drop the price of a room if some rooms are still available. There are several [[websites]] that specialize in searches for deals on rooms.

==Connections to air travel==
Large hotel chains typically have direct connections to the airline national distribution systems ([[Computer reservations system|GDS]]) ([[Sabre (computer system)|Sabre]], [[Galileo (computer system)|Galileo]], [[Amadeus (computer system)|Amadeus]], and [[Worldspan]]).  These in turn provide hotel information directly to the hundreds of thousands of travel agents that align themselves with one of these systems. Individual hotels and small hotel chains often cannot afford the expense of these direct connections and turn to other companies to provide the connections.&lt;ref name="hotel-online.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hotel-online.com/News/PR2001_1st/Mar01_ResvSvcs.html|title=Choosing a Reservation Representation Company|accessdate=2010-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Large-scale travel sites==
Several large online travel sites are, in effect, travel agencies. These sites send the hotels' information and rates downstream to literally thousands of online travel sites, most of which act as travel agents. They can then receive commission payments from the hotels for any business booked on their websites.

==Individual hotel websites==
An increasing number of hotels are building their own websites to allow them to market their hotels directly to consumers. Non-franchise chain hotels require a "booking engine" application to be attached to their website to permit people to book rooms in real time. One advantage of booking with the hotel directly is the use of the hotel's full cancellation policy as well as not needing a deposit in most situations.&lt;ref name="hotel-online.com"/&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hotel Reservations|url=http://www.reservations.com/stay|accessdate=23 June 2016|work=reservations}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The online booking engine applications are supported by [[Content management system]](CMS).

==Database systems==
To improve the likelihood of filling rooms, hotels tend to use several of the above systems. The content on many [[hotel reservation systems]] is becoming increasingly similar as more hotels sign up to all the sites. Companies thus have to either rely on specially negotiated rates with the hotels and hotel chains or trust in the influence of search engine rankings to draw in customers.

[[File:plastic hinges.jpg|thumb|300px|Diagram of a structure featuring plastic hinges]]

In the [[structural engineering]] [[beam theory]] term, plastic hinge, is used to describe the deformation of a section of a [[Beam (structure)|beam]] where [[plastic bending]] occurs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[earthquake engineering]] '''plastic hinge''' is also a type of energy [[damping]] device allowing [[Plasticity (physics)|plastic]] rotation [deformation] of an otherwise rigid column connection.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mceer.buffalo.edu/education/reu/04Proceedings/12Long_Bergad.pdf Analysis of Rotational Column with Plastic Hinge] Michael Long and Corey Bergad, retrieved November 5, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plastic behaviour==
In plastic [[Limit state design|limit analysis]] of structural members subjected to bending, it is assumed that an abrupt transition from elastic to ideally plastic behaviour occurs at a certain value of moment, known as [[Plastic Moment|plastic moment]] (M&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;). Member behaviour between M&lt;sub&gt;yp&lt;/sub&gt; and M&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; is considered to be elastic.  When M&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; is reached, a plastic hinge is formed in the member. In contrast to a [[friction]]less hinge permitting free rotation, it is postulated that the plastic hinge allows large rotations to occur at constant plastic moment M&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;.

Plastic hinges extend along short lengths of beams. Actual values of these lengths depend on cross-sections and load distributions. But detailed analyses have shown that it is sufficiently accurate to consider beams rigid-plastic, with plasticity confined to plastic hinges at points. While this assumption is sufficient for [[Limit state design|limit state analysis]], finite element formulations are available to account for the spread of plasticity along plastic hinge lengths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9445(2006)132:2(244) | volume=132 | title=Plastic Hinge Integration Methods for Force-Based Beam–Column Elements | year=2006 | journal=Journal of Structural Engineering | pages=244–252 | last1 = Scott | first1 = Michael H. | last2 = Fenves | first2 = Gregory L.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By inserting a plastic hinge at a plastic limit load into a statically determinate beam, a kinematic mechanism permitting an unbounded displacement of the system can be formed. It is known as the collapse mechanism. For each degree of static indeterminacy of the beam, an additional plastic hinge must be added to form a collapse mechanism

Sufficient number of plastic hinges(N) required to make a collapse mechanism (unstable structure):

N=Degree of static indeterminacy + 1

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1553">The '''Scanning Multichannel Microwave Radiometer (SMMR)''' [pronounced ''simmer''] was a five-frequency [[microwave radiometer]] flown on the [[Seasat]] and [[Nimbus program|Nimbus 7]] satellites. Both were launched in 1978, with the Seasat mission lasting less than six months until failure of the primary [[Electrical cable|bus]]. The Nimbus 7 SMMR lasted from 25 October 1978 until 20 August 1987. It measured dual-polarized microwave radiances, at 6.63, 10.69, 18.0, 21.0, and 37.0&amp;nbsp;GHz, from the Earth's atmosphere and surface. Its primary legacy has been the creation of areal [[sea-ice]] climatologies for the Arctic and Antarctic.

The final few months of operation was considerably fortuitous as it allowed the calibration of the radiometers and their products with the first results from the [[Special Sensor Microwave/Imager|SSMI]].

[[File:Climing anchor.JPG|thumb|right|A [[Anchor (climbing)|climbing anchor]] equalized using dyneema slings.]]

A '''sling''' or '''runner''' is an item of [[climbing equipment]] consisting of a tied or sewn loop of [[webbing]].  These can be wrapped around sections of rock, [[hitch knot|hitched]] to other pieces of equipment, or tied directly to a tensioned line using a [[Prusik]] style knot.  They may be used as  [[Climbing_equipment#Protection_devices|anchors]], to extend an anchor to reduce [[rope drag]], in anchor equalization, or to climb a rope.&lt;ref name="freedom"&gt;{{cite book | edition = 7 | editor = Cox, Steven M. |editor2=Kris Fulsaas, ed. | title = [[Mountaineering: The Freedom of the Hills]] | publisher = The Mountaineers | ISBN = 0-89886-828-9| location = Seattle | year = 2003-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
[[File:Conn - The versatile runner - Summit Nov 1957.pdf|thumb|left|Early article on use of slings by [[Jan and Herb Conn]].]]
Slings come both sewn to length and assembled from loose webbing knotted as desired.  Common sewn lengths include {{Convert|10|cm}}, {{Convert|30|cm}}, {{Convert|60|cm}}, {{Convert|120|cm}} and {{Convert|240|cm}}. They are available in widths of {{Convert|6|–|20|mm}}. Webbing for slings, also known as ''tape'', is sold off the reel, cut to length with a hot knife to prevent fraying, and tied as desired with a [[water knot]].

Sewn slings have a rated breaking strength of at least {{Convert|22|kN}}. Short sewn slings are a component of [[quickdraw]]s, sometimes known as ''dogbones''.

Traditionally, slings have been made of [[nylon]].  Increasingly, [[ultra high molecular weight polyethylene]] sold under the brand names Dyneema, Dynex and Spectra is used. These have much lower melting points than nylon, making them a potentially poor choice where high rope friction may occur. However this specialty polyethylene is lighter, smaller, and absorbs less water than nylon, and therefore has become popular.

==Gear sling==
A '''gear sling''' is a loop of webbing used to organize or carry equipment.  These can be custom items meant only to carry light gear, fully load-bearing manufactured gear racks capable of doubling for a sling, or simply a regular sling used to rack gear.

&lt;!-- [[File:Spiling 115239.JPG|thumb|Spiling seen in the outer moat (now drained) of [[Tilbury Fort]]]] --&gt;
'''Spiling''' is a traditional technique used in temperate regions of the world for the prevention of erosion to river and stream banks.

[[Willow]] spiling is currently used in the United Kingdom; live willow rods are woven between live willow uprights and the area behind is filled with soil for the willow to root into.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://evidence.environment-agency.gov.uk/FCERM/en/SC060065/MeasuresList/M5/M5T6.aspx?pagenum=2|title=Managing bank instability and erosion|publisher=Environment Agency (UK)|accessdate=20 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Rudyard Kipling|Kipling]]'s poem ''The Land'' mentions it: "They spiled along the water-course with trunks of willow-trees, And planks of elms behind 'em and immortal oaken knees."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.kipling.org.uk/poems_land.htm |title=The Land |first=Rudyard |last=Kipling |year=1917 |publisher=The Kipling Society |accessdate=3 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The species of [[willow]] used are riparian (associated with rivers); the posts, {{convert|10|cm|in|0}} in diameter, are usually ''[[Salix alba]]'' or ''[[Salix fragilis|S. fragilis]]'', and ''[[Salix viminalis|S. viminalis]]'' varieties are used for the interwoven rods. The living willow posts are driven into the bank, to a depth of {{convert|30|cm|ft|0}} or more, at {{convert|60|cm|ft|0|adj=on}} intervals and the thinner rods are woven in between, the rods are best woven at an angle slightly above horizontal to ensure good survival rates. A row of stones, gabions or wooden planks held by posts can be added to the bottom of each "spile" to prevent undercutting when the willow is establishing itself. All works should be done during the dormant period, winter in temperate zones. A layer of seeded [[coir]] matting can be pegged  onto the soil on top of the spiles to prevent the soil being washed out during flood events. This method is an example of [[soft engineering]], techniques which tend to be less expensive and more sustainable than others. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Manual of River Restoration Techniques |url=http://www.therrc.co.uk/rrc_manual.php |publisher=River Restoration Centre |accessdate=3 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before GIS (a computerized method that helps to determine suitability analysis) was widely used in the mid to late 20th century, city planners communicated their suitability analysis ideas by laying transparencies in increasing darkness over maps of the present conditions. This technique's descendant is used in a GIS application called multicriteria decision analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Malczewski|first=Jacek|date=2004-07-01|title=GIS-based land-use suitability analysis: a critical overview|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305900603000801|journal=Progress in Planning|volume=62|issue=1|pages=3–65|doi=10.1016/j.progress.2003.09.002}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1960s, a mechanism called the ecological inventory process was developed to document existing surrounding land conditions to help inform the analysis for the land in question. These mechanisms were computerized upon the advent of computers due to inefficiencies in the methods, such as the inability to overlay a large number of transparencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Collins|first=Michael G.|last2=Steiner|first2=Frederick R.|last3=Rushman|first3=Michael J.|date=2001-11-01|title=Land-Use Suitability Analysis in the United States: Historical Development and Promising Technological Achievements|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s002670010247|journal=Environmental Management|language=en|volume=28|issue=5|pages=611–621|doi=10.1007/s002670010247|issn=0364-152X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to feed a growing population that is pushing on the ability to extensively farm, suitability analysis is becoming more necessary to utilize the most productive land to its fullest potential, matching the needs of the plants more carefully to the existing assets in the environment. This technique is known as precision farming.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.itc.nl/library/Papers_2003/msc/gfm/prakash.pdf|title=Land Suitability Analysis for Agricultural Crops: A Fuzzy Multicriteria Decision Making Approach|last=Prakash|first=T. N.|date=2003|website=University of Twente|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Suitability analysis can also be used to track and label potential hazards, like earthquakes, contamination, or even crime. It can also be used to locate advantageous locations for commercial centers.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hopkins|first=Lewis D.|date=1977-10-01|title=Methods for Generating Land Suitability Maps: A Comparative Evaluation|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01944367708977903|journal=Journal of the American Institute of Planners|volume=43|issue=4|pages=386–400|doi=10.1080/01944367708977903|issn=0002-8991}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Suitability in GIS context ==

'''Suitability analysis''' in a GIS context is a geographic, or [[Geographic information system|GIS]]-based process used to determine the appropriateness of a given area for a particular use. The basic premise of GIS suitability analysis is that each aspect of the landscape has [[Intrinsic and extrinsic properties|intrinsic]] characteristics that are to some degree either suitable or unsuitable for the activities being planned. Suitability is determined through systematic, multi-factor analysis of the different aspects of the terrain.&lt;ref&gt;Michael D. Murphy (2005) ''[http://www.public.iastate.edu/~fridolph/images/la567/MichaelDMurphy_2005_LandscapeArchitecturalTheory_Suitability3.pdf Landscape Architectural Theory]''&lt;/ref&gt; Model inputs include a variety of physical, cultural, and economic factors. The results are often displayed on a map that is used to highlight areas from high to low suitability.&lt;ref&gt;James A. LaGro ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=ro11E5Cv-n0C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_v2_summary_r&amp;cad=0 Site Analysis]''&lt;/ref&gt;

A GIS suitability model typically answers the question, "Where is the best location?" — whether it involves finding the best location for a new road or pipeline, a new housing development, or a retail store. For instance, a commercial developer building a new retail store may
take into consideration distance to major highways and any competitors' stores, then combine the results with [[land use]], population density, and consumer spending data to decide on the best location for that store.
&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.esri.com/library/brochures/pdfs/spatialanalystbro.pdf Spatial Analyst]''&lt;/ref&gt;

=== GIS Applications ===

* '''Land use analysis''': Land-use suitability analysis requires the use of GIS (Geographic Information Systems) in order to survey geographical suitability. This process can be viewed through the techno-positivist and the socio-political, public engagement perspectives. Within the analysis of suitability there are also needed factors regarding economic opportunity costs and social implications within particular areas of land. There has been critique in the role that both of these aspects of careful spatial planning entail.&lt;ref&gt;Malczewski, Jacek. "GIS-based land-use suitability analysis: a critical overview." Progress in planning 62.1 (2004): 3-65. Suitability analysis for enhancing wildlife habitat in the Yolo Basin Jones &amp; Stokes Associates.; Central Valley Habitat Joint Venture.; California Wetlands Foundation.1994&lt;/ref&gt;The instrumental approach to spatial analysis can either be seen as a tool, or as a main plan when it comes to suitability. This brings up the theoretical questions of space, place, and the social construction of both. Land-Use suitability requires a multicriteria analysis, which is allows assumptive and theoretical mapping to become actualized.&lt;ref&gt;Ascough, J. C., Rector, H. D., Hoag, D. L., McMaster, G. S., Vandenberg, B. C., Shaffer, M. J., Weltz, M. A., and Ahuja, L. R., “Multicriteria Spatial Decision Support Systems: Overview, Applications, and Future Research Directions,” Proc. Integrated Assessment and Decision Support, 175 (2002).&lt;/ref&gt;Most jurisdictions use land suitability analysis for site selection, impact studies, and land use planning.&lt;ref&gt;Edward J. Kaiser, David R. Godschalk, and F. Stuart Chapin, Jr.
''[https://books.google.com/books?id=3vvEYWMtcMYC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_v2_summary_r&amp;cad=0 Urban land use planning]''&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Retail site selection''': Suitability analysis is critical for both marketing and merchandising purposes, as well as for choosing new retail locations.&lt;ref&gt;Ela Dramowicz (2005) ''[http://www.directionsmag.com/article.php?article_id=896 Retail Trade Area Analysis Using the Huff Model]''&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Agriculture'''
* '''Defense'''
* '''Crime analysis'''
* '''Town Planning'''
* '''Wildlife''': The identification of physical structuresnatural habitats, and the relationship between the two and the environmental impacts of that. This allows for the optimization between the relationship of enhancing wildlife while also allowing for man made development.&lt;ref&gt;Malczewski, Jacek. "GIS-based land-use suitability analysis: a critical overview." Progress in planning 62.1 (2004): 3-65. Suitability analysis for enhancing wildlife habitat in the Yolo Basin Jones &amp; Stokes Associates.; Central Valley Habitat Joint Venture.; California Wetlands Foundation.1994&lt;/ref&gt;

== Possibility Space ==

'''The Possibility Space''' is a framework that allows for the analysis of all possible consequences and benefits of a suitability analysis. This is created through geometrical data analysis conducted in real time with technological land mapping, allowing for the development of multiple combinations of suitability. Physically it is a visual interactive database that allows for a holistic composition of suitability.&lt;ref&gt;Wutthigrai Boonsuk ; Chris Harding; Possibility space for GIS suitability analysis. Proc. SPIE 9017, Visualization and Data Analysis 2014, 90170R (December 23, 2013); doi:10.1117/12.2040165.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Methods ==
* '''Gestalt method:''' The area is mapped and similar regions are identified. Additional maps are drawn for each homogeneous location representing each possible land use, which are compared and analyzed to ascertain the best possible land use. However, this method is not very commonly used because it requires intense knowledge of the place in question, usually only acquired when the planner has the opportunity to live in the space and dedicate an ample amount of time to it.

== Results ==
When suitability analyses are done, several different usability options may be found for the same section of land. This can be advantageous or limiting. If the land is found suitable for two or more uses that can be combined, the land uses are found compatible. An example of this may be a building with businesses on the bottom floor with residences on upper floors. Compatible land uses result in a win-win development; a need for more commerce is met while meeting a need for more housing, while also keeping people on the street all day, thereby reducing the probability of crime. Conflicting land use occurs when a piece of land can be used only for one use or the other. This is exemplified by a piece of land that can either be used as agricultural land or developed into a housing tract--should the land be developed, it can no longer be used for agriculture. The suitability analysis comes back into play here by helping planners prioritize which need is greater (in the case of the example, is housing or agricultural land more necessary in light of economic or demand pressure).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nrs.fs.fed.us/pubs/gtr/other/gtr-nc205/pdffiles/p31.PDF|title=A GIS-BASED MULTICRITERIA APPROACHES TO LAND USE SUITABILITY ASSESSMENT AND ALLOCATION|last=Mendoza|first=Guillermo A.|date=June 1, 2017|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''TICOM''' ('''Target Intelligence Committee''') was a secret [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] project formed in [[World War II]] to find and seize German [[Military intelligence|intelligence]] assets, particularly in the field of [[cryptology]] and [[signals intelligence]].{{sfn|Rezabek|2017|loc=I Introduction}}

It operated alongside other Western Allied efforts to extract German scientific and technological information and personnel during and after the war, including [[Operation Paperclip]] (for rocketry), [[Operation Alsos]] (for nuclear information) and [[Operation Surgeon]] (for avionics).  Competition with the [[Soviet Union]] for these same spoils of war was intense, with direct payoffs including [[Intercontinental ballistic missile|missile technology]] that led both to a heightened [[Cold War]] stalemate and landing a [[Apollo program|man on the Moon]].

==History==
The project was initiated by the British, but when the US Army Chief of Staff General [[George Marshall]] learnt of it, it soon became Anglo-American. The aim was to seek out and capture the cryptologic secrets of Germany. The concept was for teams of cryptologic experts, mainly drawn from the code-breaking center at [[GCHQ#Government Code and Cypher School (GC&amp;CS)|Bletchley Park]], to enter Germany with the front-line troops and capture the documents, technology and personnel of the various German signal intelligence organizations before these precious secrets could be destroyed, looted, or captured by the Soviets.{{sfn|Parrish|1986|p=276}}{{sfn|Rezabek|2017|loc=I Introduction: Origin of TICOM}} There were six such teams.{{sfn|Rezabek|2017|loc=III The Teams}}
*Team 1 was tasked to capture German ''Geheimschreiber'' (secret writer) machines whose enciphered traffic was code named [[Fish (cryptography)|Fish]]
*Team 2 was to assist Team 1 with transporting Field Marshal [[Albert Kesselring|Kesselring's]] communications train to Britain (the so-called "Jellyfish Convoy"){{sfn|Razabek|2012|loc=IV Case Studies: FISH and the Jellyfish Convoy}}
*Team 3 was to investigate an intact German Signals intelligence unit called "[[Pers Z S]]"
*Team 4 was to investigate in more detail the places in southern Germany that the Team 1 search had passed over quickly
*Team 5: Following the serendipitous discovery of a waterproof box containing some of the archives of the [[Cipher Department of the High Command of the Wehrmacht]] (OKW/''Chi'') on the bed of Lake [[Schliersee (lake)|Schliersee]], this team was tasked with recovering anything else of value from that lake
*Team 6 aimed to capture and exploit material from the German Naval Intelligence Center and the German SIGINT headquarters 
 
===OKW/''Chi'' (High Command)===
The Allied supposition that the Supreme Command of the German Armed Forces, the ''Oberkommando der Wehrmacht Chiffrierabteilung'' (abbreviated OKW/Chi) was the German equivalent of Bletchley Park, was found to be incorrect. Despite it being the top SIGINT agency in the German military, it did not set policy and did not co-ordinate or direct the signal intelligence work of the different services. It concentrated instead on employing the best cryptanalysts to design Germany's own secure communications systems, and to assist the individual services organisations.{{sfn|Razabek|2012|loc=II The Targets: OKW/Chi (High Command)}} These were:
* The Army (''Heer'') OKH/GdNA, the ''Oberkommando ders Heeres/General der Nachrichten Autklaerung''{{sfn|Razabek|2012|loc=II The Targets: GdNA (Army)}}
* Air Force (''Luftwaffe'') ''Chi Stelle''{{sfn|Razabek|2012|loc=II The Targets: Chi Stelle (Air Force)}}
* Navy (''Kriegsmarine'') ''Beobachtungsdienst'' or ''B-Dienst''{{sfn|Razabek|2012|loc=II The Targets: B-Dienst (Navy)}}
* Foreign Office ''Pers ZS''{{sfn|Razabek|2012|loc=II The Targets: Pers ZS (Foreign Office)}}
* Nazi Party ''Forschungsamt'' or ''FA''{{sfn|Razabek|2012|loc=II The Targets: FA (Nazi Party)}}

Drs Huttenhain and Fricke of OKW/''Chi'' were requested to write about the methods of solution of the German machines.{{sfn|Huttenhain|Fricke|1945}} This covered the un-steckered [[Enigma (machine)|Enigma]], the [[Enigma (machine)#Plugboard|steckered]] Enigmas; [[C-36 (cipher machine)|Hagelin]] B-36 and BC-38; the cipher teleprinters [[Siemens and Halske T52]] a/b, T52/c; the Siemens SFM T43; and the Lorenz [[Lorenz cipher|SZ 40]], SZ42 a/b. They assumed [[Kerckhoffs's principle]] that how the machines worked would be known, and addressed only the solving of keys, not the breaking of the machines in the first place. This showed that, at least amongst the cryptographers, the un-steckered Enigma was clearly recognized as solvable. The Enigmas with the plugboard (''Steckerbrett'') were considered secure if used according to the instructions, but were less secure if stereotyped beginnings or routine phrases were used, or during the period of what they described as the "faulty indicator technique" - used up until May 1940. It was their opinion, however, that the steckered Enigma had never been solved.{{sfn|Huttenhain|Fricke|1945|pp=4,5}}

===FA Discovery===
The discovery in May 1945 of the [[Nazi Party]]'s top secret [[Research Office of the Reich Air Ministry|FA]] [[signals intelligence]] and cryptanalytic agency at the [[Kaufbeuren Air Base]] in southern [[Bavaria]] came as a total surprise.{{sfn|Razabek|2012|loc=II The Targets: FA (Nazi Party)}} The province of [[Luftwaffe]] chief [[Hermann Göring]], it has been described as "the richest, most secret, the most Nazi, and the most influential" of all the German cryptanalytic intelligence agencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last = Kahn |first = David |author-link = David Kahn (writer)|title = Hitler's Spies: German Military Intelligence In World War II |place= Cambridge, MA |publisher = Da Capo Press |year = 2000 |p= 178 |isbn = 978-0306809491 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Russian "FISH" Discovery===
[[File:Russian Fish.jpg|thumb|German prisoners prepare the "Russian [[Fish (cryptography)|Fish]]" for loading and shipment to England, June 1945.]]
The greatest success for TICOM was the capture of the "Russian Fish", a set of German wide-band receivers used to intercept Soviet high-level radio teletype signals. In May 21, 1945, a party of TICOM Team 1 received tip that a German [[Prisoner of war|POW]] had knowledge of certain signals intelligence equipment and documentation relating Russian traffic. After identifying the remaining members of the unit, they were all taken back to their previous base at Rosenheim.  The prisoners recovered about 7 ½ tons of equipment. One of the machines was re-assembled and demonstrated. TICOM officer 1st Lt. Paul Whitaker later reported. "They were intercepting Russian traffic right while we were there…pretty soon they had shown us all we needed to see."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title = TICOM Team 1 Report Appendix 14: Baudot Equipment Report on Gen Der Nach.

In [[Operation Stella Polaris]] the [[Finland|Finnish]] signals intelligence unit was evacuated to [[Sweden]] following the end of the Finland/Soviet cease-fire in September 1944. The records, including cryptographic material, ended up in the hands of Americans.

The '''TN 60''' was a [[France|French]] nuclear missile warhead.

The 1 megaton TN 60 missile warhead entered service in early 1977 as an interim warhead for the MSBS [[M20 SLBM]]. The TN 60 was the first French warhead "hardened" to penetrate the Russian ABM defenses around Moscow. The TN 60 was replaced with the [[TN 61]] starting in late 1977.

[[File:GreenwayPlazaTowers.JPG|thumb|[[Greenway Plaza]], the location of Transocean's [[Houston]] offices]]

'''Transocean Ltd.''' is the world's largest [[offshore drilling]] contractor and is based in [[Vernier, Switzerland]]. The company has offices in 20 countries, including Switzerland, Canada, United States, Norway, Scotland, India, Brazil, Singapore, Indonesia and Malaysia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.deepwater.com/about-transocean/offices Transocean: Offices]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, Transocean was implicated in the [[Deepwater Horizon oil spill]] resulting from the explosion of one of its oil rigs in the [[Gulf of Mexico]].

==Current operations==
The company provides quarterly updates on the status of its fleet on its website.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.deepwater.com/investor-relations/fleet-status-report Transocean: Fleet Status Report]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, [[Chevron Corporation]] accounted for 14% of the company's revenues and [[Royal Dutch Shell]] accounted for 10% of the company's revenues.&lt;ref name=10K/&gt;

==History==

Transocean was formed as a result of the merger of Southern Natural Gas Company, later [[Sonat]], with many smaller drilling companies.

In 1953, the [[Birmingham, Alabama]]-based Southern Natural Gas Company created '''The Offshore Company''' after acquiring the joint drilling operation DeLong-McDermott from DeLong Engineering and [[J. Ray McDermott]]. In 1954, the company launched Rig 51, the first mobile [[jackup rig]], in the Gulf of Mexico. In 1967, the Offshore Company went public. In 1978, SNG turned it into a wholly owned subsidiary. In 1982, it was changed to '''Sonat Offshore Drilling Inc.''', reflecting a change in its parent's name. In 1993, Sonat spun it off.&lt;ref name=fundinguniverse&gt;{{cite book | last=Pederson | first=Jay P.  | chapter=Transocean Sedco Forex Inc. | title=International Directory of Company Histories | volume=vol. 45 | location=Detroit | url=http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/Transocean-Sedco-Forex-Inc-Company-History.html | publisher=St. James Press| year=2002 | isbn=978-1-55862-686-7  | accessdate=23 May 2010| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120528195312/http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/Transocean-Sedco-Forex-Inc-company-History.html| archivedate=28 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996, the company acquired Norwegian group Transocean ASA for US$1.5 billion. Transocean started in the 1970s as a [[whaling]] company and expanded through a series of mergers. The new company was called '''Transocean Offshore.'''  The new company began building massive drilling operations with drills capable of going to 10,000&amp;nbsp;feet (as opposed to 3,000&amp;nbsp;feet at the time) and operating two drill operations on the same ship. Its first ship, ''[[Discoverer Enterprise]]'', cost nearly US$430 million and was {{convert|834|ft|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=The Fleet: ''Discoverer Enterprise'' | url=http://www.deepwater.com/fw/main/Discoverer-Enterprise-141.html | publisher=Transocean | year=2010 | accessdate=23 May 2010| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131225110933/http://www.deepwater.com/fw/main/Discoverer-Enterprise-141.html| archivedate=25 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Enterprise [[Ship class|class]] [[drillship]] is the largest of the drilling ships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Richard O. | last=Aichele  | title=Drill-Ship Technologies Create Ultra-Deep Solutions | url=http://www.professionalmariner.com/ME2/dirmod.asp?sid=420C4D38DC9C4E3A903315CDDC65AD72&amp;nm=Archives&amp;type=Publishing&amp;mod=Publications%3A%3AArticle&amp;mid=8F3A7027421841978F18BE895F87F791&amp;tier=4&amp;id=CBFD64D555804D7DB9EFD24DACE91582 | work=Professional Mariner | date=September 2007 | accessdate=21 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, Transocean merged with Sedco Forex, the offshore drilling subsidiary of [[Schlumberger]] in a $3.2 billion stock transaction in which Schlumberger shareholders received shares of Transocean.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/transocean-offshore-and-schlumberger-combine-forces-to-create-the-leading-offshore-drilling-company-73542642.html | title=Transocean Offshore and Schlumberger Combine Forces to Create The Leading Offshore Drilling Company | publisher=[[PRNewswire]] |date=12 July 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sedco Forex had been formed from a merger of two drilling companies, the '''S'''outh'''e'''astern '''D'''rilling '''Co'''mpany (Sedco), founded in 1947 by [[Bill Clements]] and acquired by Schlumberger in 1985 for $1 billion &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.slb.com/about/history/1980s.aspx Schlumberger History: 1980s]&lt;/ref&gt; and French drilling company Forages et Exploitations Pétrolières (Forex) founded in 1942 in [[German occupation of France during World War II|German-occupied France]] for drilling in North Africa.&lt;ref name=fundinguniverse/&gt; Schlumberger first got a foothold in the company in 1959 and then assumed total control in 1964, and renamed it Forex Neptune Drilling Company.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.slb.com/about/history/1980s.aspx Schlumberger History: 1960s]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, Transocean acquired R&amp;B Falcon Corporation, owner of 115 drilling rigs, in a deal valued at $17.7 billion. With the acquisition, Transocean gained control of what at the time was the world's largest offshore operation. Among R&amp;B Falcon's assets was the ''[[Deepwater Horizon]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/transocean-sedco-forex-signs-definitive-agreement-to-acquire-rb-falcon-corporation-72924152.html | title=Transocean Sedco Forex Signs Definitive Agreement To Acquire R&amp;B Falcon Corporation | publisher=[[PRNewswire]] | date=21 August 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; R&amp;B Falcon had acquired Cliffs Drilling Company in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/rb-falcon-corporation-and-cliffs-drilling-company-announce-execution-of-definitive-merger-agreement-76288217.html | title=R&amp;B Falcon Corporation and Cliffs Drilling Company Announce Execution of Definitive Merger Agreement | publisher=[[PRNewswire]] | date=21 August 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, the company's ''[[Discoverer Spirit]]'' rig set a world record for the deepest offshore oil and gas well of {{convert|34189|ft|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="record"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.contractorsunlimited.co.uk/news/090902-transocean.shtml | title=Transocean's Ultra-Deepwater Semisubmersible Rig Deepwater Horizon Drills World's Deepest Oil and Gas Well | publisher=Contractors Unlimited | date=2 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, the US Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission filed a case against Transocean, alleging violations of the [[Foreign Corrupt Practices Act]]. The case alleged that Transocean paid bribes through its freight forwarding agents to Nigerian customs officials. Transocean later admitted to approving the bribes and agreed to pay USD $13,440,000 to settle the matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url=http://www.justice.gov/criminal-fraud/case/united-states-v-transocean-inc-court-docket-number-10-cr-768 | publisher=United States Department of Justice | title=United States v.

In 2007, the company merged with [[GlobalSantaFe Corporation]] in a transaction that created a company with an enterprise value of $53 billion. Shareholders of [[GlobalSantaFe Corporation]] received $15 billion of cash as well as stock in the new company for their shares. Robert E. Rose, who was non-executive chairman of GlobalSantaFe, was made Transocean's chairman.

==Controversies==

===Accidents and incidents===
Transocean was rated as a leader in its industry for many years. However, since the company's 2007 [[merger]] with GlobalSantaFe, Transocean's reputation has suffered considerably, according to EnergyPoint Research, an independent oil service industry rating firm. From 2004 to 2007, Transocean was the leader or near the top among deep-water drillers in "job quality" and "overall satisfaction." In 2008 and 2009, surveys ranked Transocean as last among deep-water drillers for "job quality" and next to last in "overall satisfaction." In 2008 and 2009, Transocean ranked first for in-house safety and environmental policies, and in the middle of the pack for perceived environmental and safety record.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Rig owner had rising tally of accidents | url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704307804575234471807539054?mod=WSJ_hpp_MIDDLETopStories | work=The Wall Street Journal | date=10 May 2010 | accessdate=30 May 2010 | first=Ben | last=Casselman | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121110161019/http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704307804575234471807539054.html?mod=WSJ_hpp_MIDDLETopStories | archivedate=10 November 2012 }}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Deepwater Horizon'' explosion and massive oil spill, starting in April 2010, further hurt its reputation. "Transocean is dominant, but the accident has definitely tarnished its reputation for worker safety and for being able to manage and deliver on extraordinarily complex deepwater projects," said Christopher Ruppel, an energy expert and managing director of capital markets at Execution Noble, an [[investment bank]].&lt;ref name=zeller&gt;{{cite news | first=Tom | last=Zeller | first2=Clifford | last2=Krauss | title=Transocean Finds itself caught in the spotlight | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/25/business/energy-environment/25transocean.html | publisher=[[The New York Times]] | date=25 May 2010 | page=B1  | accessdate=30 May 2010 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130413054816/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/25/business/energy-environment/25transocean.html | archivedate=13 April 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====''Deepwater Horizon'' drilling rig explosion (2010)====
{{main|Deepwater Horizon drilling rig explosion}}
On 20 April 2010, a fire was reported on a Transocean-owned [[semisubmersible]] [[Oil platform|drilling rig]], ''[[Deepwater Horizon]]''. ''Deepwater Horizon'' was a RBS8D design of Reading &amp; Bates Falcon, a firm that was acquired by Transocean in 2001. The fire broke out at 10:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. CDT [[Central Time Zone (Americas)|UTC−5]] in US waters of Mississippi Canyon 252 in the [[Gulf of Mexico]]. The rig was {{convert|41|mi|km|abbr=on}} off the [[Louisiana]] coast. The [[US Coast Guard]] launched a rescue operation after the explosion which killed 11 workers and critically injured seven of the 126-member crew.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.cnn.com/2010/US/04/21/oil.rig.explosion/index.html?hpt=T1 | title=At least 11 missing after blast on oil rig in Gulf | publisher=CNN | date=21 April 2010 | access-date=21 April 2010| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121108040102/http://www.cnn.com/2010/US/04/21/oil.rig.explosion/index.html?hpt=T1 | archivedate=8 November 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | title=Transocean Ltd.

''Deepwater Horizon'' was completely destroyed and subsequently sank.

As the ''Deepwater Horizon'' sank, the riser pipe that connected the well-head to the rig was severed. As a result, oil began to spill into the [[Gulf of Mexico]]. Estimates of the leak were about 80,000 barrels per day – for 87 days.

Louisiana Governor [[Bobby Jindal]] declared a state of emergency on 29 April, as the oil slick grew and headed toward the most important and most sensitive wetlands in North America, threatening to destroy wildlife and the livelihood of thousands of fishermen. The head of BP Group told [[CNN]]'s Brian Todd on 28 April that the accident could have been prevented and focused blame on Transocean, which owned and partly manned the rig.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | publisher=[[CNN]] | url=http://www.cnn.com/2010/US/04/29/louisiana.oil.rig | title=Oil slick just a few miles from Louisiana coast | date=29 April 2010 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121108040125/http://www.cnn.com/2010/US/04/29/louisiana.oil.rig/ | archivedate=8 November 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Transocean came under fire from lawyers, representing the fishing and tourism businesses that were hit by the oil spill, and the [[United States Department of Justice]] for seeking to use a [[Limitation of Liability Act of 1851]] to restrict its liability for economic damages to $26.7 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Sherwell | first=Philip |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/energy/oilandgas/7806200/Gulf-of-Mexico-oil-spill-Transocean-silent-as-BP-bears-the-brunt-of-anger.html | title=Gulf of Mexico oil spill: Transocean silent as BP bears the brunt of anger |work=The Daily Telegraph | date=5 June 2010 | access-date=31 July 2010 | location=London | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130302093827/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/energy/oilandgas/7806200/Gulf-of-Mexico-oil-spill-Transocean-silent-as-BP-bears-the-brunt-of-anger.html | archivedate=2 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During Congressional testimony, Transocean and BP blamed each other for the disaster. It emerged that a "heated argument" broke out on the platform 11&amp;nbsp;hours before the accident, in which Transocean and BP personnel disagreed on an engineering decision related to the closing of the well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Miguel |last=Bustillo | url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704717004575268302434395796 | title=Big Spat on Rig Preceded Explosion | newspaper=[[The Wall Street Journal]] | date=27 May 2010 | access-date=21 July 2010 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130109064144/http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704717004575268302434395796.html | archivedate=9 January 2013 }}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 14 May 2010, US President [[Barack Obama]] commented, "I did not appreciate what I considered to be a ridiculous spectacle… executives of BP and Transocean and Halliburton [the firm responsible for cementing the well] falling over each other to point the finger of blame at somebody else. The American people could not have been impressed with that display, and I certainly wasn't."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.oilmarketer.co.uk/2010/05/16/obama-condemns-"finger-of-blame"-over-oil-spill/ | first=Kay | last=Murchie | date=16 May 2010 | title=Obama condemns 'finger of blame' over oil spill | publisher=Oil Marketer | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140515001349/http://www.oilmarketer.co.uk/2010/05/16/obama-condemns-%E2%80%9Cfinger-of-blame%E2%80%9C-over-oil-spill/ | archivedate=15 May 2014 | accessdate=29 September 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Transocean later claimed that 2010, the year in which the disaster occurred, was "the best year in safety performance in our company’s history". In a regulatory filing, Transocean said, "Notwithstanding the tragic loss of life in the Gulf of Mexico, we achieved an exemplary statistical safety record as measured by our total recordable incident rate and total potential severity rate."  They used this justification to award employees about two-thirds of the maximum possible safety bonuses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/e2b81ec4-5cca-11e0-ab7c-00144feab49a.html?ftcamp=rss#axzz1ITuJKEjF | title=Transocean awards bonuses 'for safety' in 2010 | accessdate=3 April 2011 | last=McNulty | first=Sheila | date=2 April 2011 | work=[[Financial Times]] | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110828142026/http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/e2b81ec4-5cca-11e0-ab7c-00144feab49a.html?ftcamp=rss | archivedate=28 August 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/2011/04/03/2011-04-03_transocean_executives_get_bonuses_despite_massive_gulf_spill_company_lauds_best_.html?r=news/national | title=Transocean executives get bonuses, despite massive Gulf spill; company lauds 'best year in safety' | access-date=3 April 2011 | last=Caulfield | first=Philip | date=3 April 2011 | work=[[New York Daily News]] | location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to broad criticism, including from Interior Secretary [[Ken Salazar]], the company announced that its executives would donate the safety portion of the bonuses to a fund supporting the victims' families.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-04-05/transocean-to-donate-safety-bonus-awards-after-criticism-1-.html | title=Transocean to Donate Safety Bonus Awards After Criticism | accessdate=8 April 2011 | last=Carroll | first=Joe | date=5 April 2011 | newspaper=[[Bloomberg News]] | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121105032728/http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-04-05/transocean-to-donate-safety-bonus-awards-after-criticism-1-.html | archivedate=5 November 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Offshore drilling leak off the Brazilian coast (2011)====
The offshore drilling facility "Sedco 706", operated by Transocean under contract from [[Chevron Corporation|Chevron]], began to leak in November 2011 while working on the "Frade" oil field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.offshoreenergytoday.com/brazil-chevron-needs-to-indemnify-transocean-for-frade-spill-claims/|title=Brazil: Chevron Needs to Indemnify Transocean for Frade Spill Claims?|website=Offshore Technology|date=26 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oil began leaking from the seabed at a depth of approximately 1100 to 1200m. Damage included an oil slick (oil floating on the ocean surface) covering an area of approximately 80&amp;nbsp;km2 and growing. This put the oil at a distance of about 370&amp;nbsp;km from Rio de Janeiro, but other beautiful beaches are much closer (estimated 140&amp;nbsp;km). The Brazilian government sued Transocean and attempted to force the company to cease operations in Brazil, but a settlement was reached without a finding of fault or liability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.upi.com/Business_News/Energy-Industry/2013/09/18/Transocean-cleared-in-Brazilian-oil-spill-case/92971379507769/ | title=Transocean cleared in Brazilian oil spill case | publisher=[[United Press International]] | date=18 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====''Transocean Winner'' grounding on the Isle of Lewis, Scotland (2016)====

In the early hours of Monday 8 August 2016, the [[Semi-submersible|semi-submersible drilling rig]] ''Transocean Winner'' ran aground near [[Dail Mòr|Dalmore]] in the Carloway district of the [[Isle of Lewis]] in the [[Outer Hebrides]], [[Scotland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Drilling rig blown ashore in storms off Western Isles|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-north-east-orkney-shetland-37007656|accessdate=17 August 2016|publisher=BBC News|date=8 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rig had been under tow by the tug [http://www.alpmaritime.com/fleet/218-mt-alp-forward Alp Forward] in winds of galeforce, when the tow line broke. The rig subsequently drifted ashore at Dalmore and became stuck fast on rocks at 07.30 BST. Continuing poor weather meant that a damage inspection by salvors has been practically impossible, as personnel require to be airlifted on to the rig, in spite of it being close to the shore.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Full assessment of Transocean Winner still to be made|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-highlands-islands-37057507|accessdate=17 August 2016|publisher=BBC News|date=12 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rig was carrying approximately 280 tons of diesel, to power its generators, of which 53 tons is thought to have leaked into the sea, and dispersed or evaporated in rough conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Diesel oil leak from grounded rig Transocean Winner|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-highlands-islands-37038714|accessdate=17 August 2016|publisher=BBC News|date=10 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Environmental monitoring of plant and animal life is on-going, particularly in view of the economically important fish farming operations in nearby [[Loch Ròg]].

===Environmental record===
In early April 2015, six activists with the environmental group Greenpeace boarded the ship Blue Marlin while at sea, which was carrying one of Transocean's rigs, the 120 meter (400&amp;nbsp;ft.) tall Polar Pioneer, and camped out in superstructure of the rig. The activists promised to continuing their protests as the rig undergoes final outfitting while it is anchored in the Port Angeles harbor in Washington State and then later in Puget Sound.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Coast Guard decides against plans to accommodate protests of giant oil rig’s visit to Port Angeles|url=http://www.peninsuladailynews.com/article/20150415/NEWS/304159973/update-coast-guard-decides-against-plans-to-accommodate-protests-of | accessdate=15 April 2015 | publisher=Peninsula Daily News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Trinitroethylorthocarbonate''' also known as '''TNEOC''' is an [[oxidizer]] with excellent chemical stability.{{Citation needed|reason=exellent chemical stability is a subjective term and any statement of stability needs to have contextual information given the statement later in the page about the highly explosive nature of this compound|date=May 2017}} Its explosion point is 238 °C, and it begins to be decomposed at 200 °C. Its explosion heat is 5.797 J/g and specific volume is 694 L/kg.&lt;ref name="Liquid Explosives"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Liu|first1=Jiping|title=Liquid Explosives|date=2015|publisher=Springer|isbn=9783662458471|pages=5, 6, 8, 136, 309|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=NGYiBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA8|accessdate=26 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its structure is closely related to that of [[trinitroethylorthoformate]] (TNEOF). Both are highly explosive and very shock-sensitive, and may be dissolved in nitroalkanes to reduce their shock-sensitivity.&lt;ref name="Liquid Explosives" /&gt;

==Synthesis==

[[Trinitroethanol]] reacts with [[carbon tetrachloride]] under a catalyst of FeCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.
:&lt;chem&gt;\underset{Carbon\ tetrachloride}{CCl4} + \underset{Trinitroethanol}{4HOCH2C(NO2)3} -&gt;[\ce{FeCl3}] {TNEOC} + 4HCl&lt;/chem&gt;

The '''UK Payments Administration Ltd''' ('''UKPA''') is a [[United Kingdom]] service company that provides people, facilities and expertise to the UK payments industry.

UKPA was created on 6 July 2009, as a successor of the '''Association for Payment Clearing Services''' ('''APACS''') to support the systems behind UK payments, such as [[BACS|Bacs]], [[CHAPS]] and the [[Cheque and Credit Clearing Company]]. APACS had been created in 1985&lt;ref name="APACS"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wood|first1=Frank|last2=Sangster|first2=Alan|title=Frank Wood's business accounting UK GAAP|date=2008|publisher=FT Prentice Hall|location=Harlow, England|isbn=9780273718765|page=128|edition=1st }}&lt;/ref&gt; to oversee the majority of UK payment clearing systems and keep their operational efficiency and integrity in order.
