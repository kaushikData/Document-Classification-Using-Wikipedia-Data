      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6387">The '''Advertising Hall of Fame''', operated by the [[American Advertising Federation|American Advertising Federation (AAF)]], began in 1948 as a result of a proposal by the New York Ad Club and its president, Andrew Haire, to the Advertising Federation of America, the predecessor organization to the American Advertising Federation. The plan provided that the Advertising Hall of Fame be administered by the Advertising Federation of America on behalf of the entire advertising industry. It honors those men and women who have best served the cause of advertising. Since then, 191 extraordinary individuals have been elected to this illustrious group.

The council of judges and its executive committee are appointed each year by the president of the American Advertising Federation and chair of the Advertising Hall of Fame. These distinguished industry executives are chosen from the ranks of advertisers, agencies, media organizations and academic institutions in the United States. The council of judges considers the election of either living or deceased persons whose record of advertising and service must be accomplished in the United States or with an American company abroad. To be eligible, individuals must be retired from their primary careers.&lt;ref&gt;http://advertisinghall.org/history/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1929">'''Archives management'''  is the area of management concerned with the maintenance and use of archives. It is concerned with acquisition,  care, arrangement,  description and retrieval of records once they have been transferred from an organisation to the archival repository.  Once records have been selected and transferred to archival custody, they become [[archive|archives]].&lt;ref&gt;https://library.unm.edu/cswr/docs/archives-and-records-management.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www2.archivists.org/glossary/terms/a/archives-management&lt;/ref&gt;

== Managing archives==
The steps involved in managing archives include acquiring and receiving from the office of the origin, arranging and describing according to archival principles and practices, providing easy retrieval and access to archives.  &lt;ref&gt;https://www.hw.ac.uk/services/docs/ArchivesManagement.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.archives.gov/research/alic/reference/archives-resources/terminology.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Archives and Accessibility==
An increasingly relevant aspect of archives management is ensuring the accessibility of archives and archive materials to all users regardless of physical ability. Most archivist and library associations now include resources on educating archivists on how to manage their archives to be more accessible.&lt;ref&gt;https://www2.archivists.org/groups/amrtrmrt-working-group-on-accessibility/a-quick-guide-to-accessibility-and-archives&lt;/ref&gt; Both archivists and [[special collections]] librarians are faced with the issue of making their resources more accessible to the public, as their items were created prior to the consideration of accessibility.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.oclc.org/content/dam/research/publications/2015/oclcresearch-making-special-collections-accessible-2015.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Asiatown''', also spelled '''AsiaTown''' and formerly known as '''Chinatown''', is a [[Chinatown]] located in [[Cleveland]], [[Ohio]], in the United States. [[Chinese people]], brought to the country as railroad workers, established the area in the 1860s. The area became known as Chinatown in the 1920s, and was then centered at Rockwell Avenue and E. 22nd Street. Large numbers of non-Chinese people from Asia settled in the area in the 1960s and 1970s, leading to the enclave's expansion eastward. The expanded enclave was named Asiatown in 2006, with that portion on Rockwell Avenue often being referred to as "Old Chinatown" or "Historic Chinatown".

Asiatown straddles the boundary between the [[Downtown Cleveland]] and [[Goodrich–Kirtland Park]] neighborhoods.

==Chinatown==
===Rise of Chinatown===
Cleveland's first Asian residents were Chinese, who came to the United States to work on the railroads. These individuals came to Cleveland to escape the [[racism]] and anti-Chinese sentiments of white people on the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]].{{sfn|Williams|2007|pages=320-321}} Their numbers were initially small, and numbered only 23 in 1880. By 1900, the number had risen to 96.{{sfn|Dutka|2014|page=12}} Initially, these Chinese settled on Ontario Street between Lakeside and St. Clair Avenues, north of [[Public Square, Cleveland|Public Square]], and the enclave consisted of small retail shops like clothing stores, grocery stores, laundries, and restaurants.{{sfn|Fugita|1977|page=24}} By the 1890s, however, the enclave was dissolving, with Chinese-run shops scattered throughout the downtown area.{{sfn|Dutka|2014|page=15}}

Rapid development of Cleveland's downtown, particularly the [[Terminal Tower]] complex (which began construction in 1926), displaced these residents and shops and drove them eastward.&lt;ref name=snook&gt;{{cite news|last=Snook|first=Debbi|title=Cleveland's Defunct Chinatown|work=The Plain Dealer|date=September 20, 2011|accessdate=September 24, 2017|url=http://www.cleveland.com/taste/index.ssf/2011/09/clevelands_defunct_chinatown_o.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the 1920s, a much larger and more permanent enclave had formed around the intersection of Rockwell Avenue and E. 22nd Street&lt;ref name=asiatown&gt;{{cite web|title=Asiatown|website=Encyclopedia of Cleveland History|date=2017|accessdate=September 24, 2017|url=https://case.edu/ech/articles/a/asiatown/}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the name "Chinatown" began to be used in the 1920s to describe the area.&lt;ref name=smithname&gt;{{cite news|last=Smith|first=Robert L.|title=Retailers, groups debate name for city's Asian-flavored streets|work=The Plain Dealer|date=November 3, 2006|page=B2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Heyday: 1930s to 1960s===
Cleveland's Chinatown was largely confined to Rockwell Avenue between E. 21st and E. 24th Streets.&lt;ref name=petkovic /&gt;&lt;ref name=trattner&gt;{{cite news|last=Trattner|first=Douglas|title=The Many Flavors of Cleveland's Asiatown, One of the City's Most Delicious and Diverse Dining Neighborhoods |work=Cleveland Scene|date=December 15, 2016|accessdate=September 24, 2017|url=https://www.clevescene.com/cleveland/the-many-flavors-of-clevelands-asiatown-one-of-the-citys-most-delicious-and-diverse-dining-neighborhoods/Content?oid=4998809}}&lt;/ref&gt; On Leong Tong, a merchant association, which had begun construction on its new building at 2138-2136 Rockwell Avenue in 1926, formally opened its retail, office, and residential space on January 4, 1931. This two-story structure contained ground-floor retail and restaurant space and second-story office and residential units.{{sfn|Dutka|2014|page=57}} The enclave thrived in the 1930s,&lt;ref name=trattner /&gt; as popular and now-locally famous restaurants like Shanghai Restaurant (which opened in 1931),{{sfn|Dutka|2014|page=59}} Red Dragon Café (which opened in 1932),{{sfn|Dutka|2014|page=84}} and Golden Gate (which opened in 1933){{sfn|Dutka|2014|page=59}} drew large numbers of white Americans. Dishes such as [[chow mein]] and [[chop suey]], which had taste and texture similar to Western European cooking, were mainstays of these establishments.&lt;ref name=trattner /&gt; Most Chinatown restaurants stayed open until 4 A.M. on weekends.&lt;ref name=trattner /&gt;

The number of Chinese living in Chinatown rose significantly during the next four decades. A major influx of new Chinese residents occurred in the 1950s, after the [[History of the People's Republic of China|Communist revolution in China in 1949]].&lt;ref name=asiatown /&gt; Chinatown remained a popular dining destination throughout the 1940s and 1950s.&lt;ref name=trattner /&gt; A new restaurant, the Three Chinese Sisters, opened in 1949{{sfn|Dutka|2014|page=65}} and quickly became a Cleveland dining landmark.&lt;ref name=snook /&gt;

===Decline===
Chinatown entered a sharp decline in the 1970s. In part, this was caused by the influx of non-Chinese Asians into the area.{{sfn|Dutka|2014|page=68}} Shared cultural values, which encouraged Chinese to support other Chinese businesses and families, broke down as pluralism increased.{{sfn|Dutka|2014|page=68}} Another factor was the lessening of racial barriers, which allowed more Asians to obtain a college degree or a better job and leave Chinatown.{{sfn|Dutka|2014|page=68}} A final factor was the improved financial condition of second- and third-generation immigrant families, many of whom left downtown for larger homes in the suburbs.{{sfn|Dutka|2014|page=68}} Although the very popular&lt;ref name=snook /&gt; Golden Coins restaurant opened in 1976 in the former Rockwell Restaurant building,{{sfn|Dutka|2014|page=66}} by 1985 only two businesses (both restaurants) remained in Cleveland's historic Chinatown.{{sfn|Dutka|2014|page=68}}

An early 1990 crime wave and the opening of Asia Plaza (a shopping mall catering to Asian businesses and consumers) in nearby Asiatown worsened the economic decline of historic Chinatown.{{sfn|Dutka|2014|page=68}} The last Asian restaurant on Rockwell Avenue&lt;ref name=snook /&gt; was Shanghai Wu's Cuisine, which took over the Shanghai Restaurant space in December 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Crea|first=Joe|title=New owners bring promise to old locale|work=The Plain Dealer|date=December 13, 2006|page=F3}}&lt;/ref&gt; It closed in February 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hunnicutt|first=Trevor|title=Taiwanese immigrants opening vegetarian restaurant, temple at former Shanghai Restaurant|work=The Plain Dealer|date=June 3, 2009|accessdate=September 24, 2017|url=http://blog.cleveland.com/metro/2009/06/taiwanese_immigrants_opening_v.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Asiatown==
[[File:Bo Loong restaurant - Asiatown Cleveland.jpg|thumb|Bo Loong opened in 1986, helping to anchor the new Asiatown.]]

===Rise of a "new" Chinatown===
Cleveland saw a major influx of [[Koreans]] from 1960 to 1970, many of whom lived in Chinatown. Significant numbers of [[Vietnamese people|Vietnamese]] took up residence in the enclave from 1980 to 2000.&lt;ref name=asiatown /&gt; As these and other Asian immigrant groups settled in greater numbers in Cleveland, the Asian enclave began to expand beyond its original boundaries to the east. By the early 1990s, a new enclave had emerged, bounded by St. Clair and Payne Avenues and E. 30th and E. 40th Streets.&lt;ref name=trattner /&gt;

In 1986, a Chinese restaurant, Bo Loong, opened in a newly constructed building at 3922 St. Clair Avenue. Attracting both Asian and non-Asian customers,{{sfn|Dutka|2014|page=88}} it proved to be a groundbreaking establishment which anchored the emerging Asiatown.{{sfn|Dutka|2014|page=97}} In 1991,{{sfn|Dutka|2014|page=68}} Asia Plaza opened on the northwest corner of E. 30th Street and Payne Avenue. This modern shopping mall, which featured extensive parking space, not only provided a more comfortable indoor shopping experience for consumers but also drew new diners. It was anchored by Li Wah, the second in a chain of restaurants (all featuring the "Wah" name) which catered to both Asian and non-Asian palates. New Asian grocery stores, stocking items for a wide range of Asian cuisines, also opened.&lt;ref name=trattner /&gt;

===Asiatown: 2006 to present===
[[File:Erhu player - Asian Fest 2016 (28523535036).jpg|thumb|An erhu player performs at the 2016 Cleveland Asian Festival.]]
By 2002, a distinct Asian enclave had emerged in the "new Chinatown".&lt;ref name=trattner /&gt; In 2006, merchants and developers began using the term "Asiatown" to the describe the area,&lt;ref name=smithname /&gt;&lt;ref name=trattner /&gt; a term which better reflected the cultural diversity of the enclave.&lt;ref name=petkovic&gt;{{cite news|last=Petkovic|first=John|title=Cleveland's AsiaTown becoming a melting pot for the larger community|work=The Plain Dealer|date=March 25, 2011|accessdate=September 24, 2017|url=http://www.cleveland.com/entertainment/index.ssf/2011/03/clevelands_asiatown_becoming_a.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name was formally adopted by local residents and merchants and by the St. Clair-Superior Development Corporation in August 2007.&lt;ref name=smithnewname&gt;{{cite news|last=Smith|first=Robert L.|title=East Side neighborhood unveils new name: AsiaTown|work=The Plain Dealer|date=August 10, 2007|page=B2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A second major shopping mall, Asian Town Center, opened in Asiatown in 2008.{{sfn|Dutka|2014|page=96}} Located at Superior Avenue and E. 38th Street, tenants included Korean and Vietnamese restaurants and a large Asian grocery store. The mall also included non-traditional businesses, such a dance studio, homeopathic medicine "pharmacy", martial arts studio, and the Negative Space Gallery. The art gallery, which opened in 2010, featured artist workspaces, a performance area, coffee bar, and exhibition space.&lt;ref name=gronym /&gt;

Asiatown merchants inaugurated the Cleveland Asian Festival in 2011. The one-day festival drew more than 10,000 people its first year.&lt;ref name=petkovic /&gt; By 2015, the festival had expanded to two days and drew more than 45,000 people—making it one of Cleveland's most popular spring events.&lt;ref name=gronym&gt;{{cite news|last=Groynom|first=Rebecca|title=A perfect slice of Cleveland: AsiaTown|work=Freshwater Cleveland|date=May 19, 2016|accessdate=September 24, 2017|url=http://www.freshwatercleveland.com/features/PerfectSliceAsiatown051916.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt; The revitalization of the enclave led to a major renovation of the historic Chinatown Building on Rockwell Avenue in 2011.&lt;ref name=snook /&gt;

In 2015, Asiatown merchants inaugurated the first of the Night Market events. Held on Rockwell Avenue and designed to help bring life to Old Chinatown, the Night Market (held during evening hours once a month in the summer)&lt;ref name=gronym /&gt;&lt;ref name=demarco&gt;{{cite news|last=DeMarco|first=Laura|title=Night Market Cleveland announces 2017 schedule for Old Chinatown events|work=The Plain Dealer|date=May 2, 2017|accessdate=September 24, 2017|url=http://www.cleveland.com/entertainment/index.ssf/2017/05/night_market_cleveland_announc.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; featured live music, dance performances, and the sale of alcoholic beverages, art, food, and soft drinks.&lt;ref name=gronym /&gt; The first few Night Markets attracted only a few hundred people, but by 2016 some nights had more than 10,000 people patronize the event. Night Market has since become an economic mainstay of Asiatown, along with the Cleveland Asian Festival.&lt;ref name=demarco /&gt;

==Boundaries==
The name of the enclave is spelled both "Asiatown"&lt;ref name=snook /&gt;&lt;ref name=trattner /&gt; and "AsiaTown".&lt;ref name=smithnewname /&gt;&lt;ref name=gronym /&gt;{{sfn|Dutka|2014|page=10}}

Asiatown consists of two sections.&lt;ref name=petkovic /&gt; That portion known as "Historic Chinatown"{{sfn|Dutka|2014|page=69}} or "Old Chinatown"&lt;ref name=demarco /&gt; runs on either side of Rockwell Avenue between E. 21st and E. 24th Streets.&lt;ref name=petkovic /&gt; The remainder of Asiatown is bounded by E. 30th and E. 40th Streets between St. Clair and Perkins Avenues.&lt;ref name=petkovic /&gt;

The population of Asiatown was approximately 1,200 in 2011.&lt;ref name=petkovic /&gt;

'''Clarence Seward Darrow''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|d|ær|oʊ}}; April 18, 1857 – March 13, 1938) was an American lawyer, a leading member of the [[American Civil Liberties Union]], and a prominent advocate for [[Georgist]] economic reform. He defended high-profile clients in many famous trials of the early 20th century, including teenage [[thrill killing|thrill killers]] [[Leopold and Loeb]] for murdering 14-year-old Robert "Bobby" Franks (1924); teacher [[John T. Scopes]] in the [[Scopes Trial|Scopes "Monkey" Trial]] (1925), in which he opposed statesman and orator [[William Jennings Bryan]]; and [[Ossian Sweet]] in a racially charged self-defense case (1926). Called a "sophisticated country lawyer",&lt;ref name="Linder1997"&gt;Linder, Douglas O. (1997).

==Early life==
Clarence Darrow was born in the small town of [[Kinsman, Ohio]], on April 18, 1857,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Darrow|first=Clarence|title=The Story of My Life|year=1932|publisher=Grosset and Dunlap|location=New York|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; the fifth son of Amirus and Emily Darrow (née Eddy). Both the Darrow and Eddy families had deep roots in colonial [[New England]], and several of Darrow's ancestors served in the [[American Revolution]]. Darrow's father was an ardent [[abolitionism|abolitionist]] and a proud iconoclast and religious freethinker. He was known throughout the town as the "village infidel".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Darrow|first=Clarence|title=The Story of My Life|year=1932|publisher=Grosset and Dunlap|location=New York|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Emily Darrow was an early supporter of [[female suffrage]] and a [[women's rights]] advocate.

The young Clarence attended [[Allegheny College]] and the [[University of Michigan Law School]], but did not graduate from either institution. He attended Allegheny College for only one year before the [[Panic of 1873]] struck, and Darrow was determined not to be a financial burden to his father any longer. Over the next three years he taught in the winter at the district school in a country community. While teaching, Darrow started to [[Reading law|study the law]] on his own, and by the end of his third year of teaching, his family urged him to enter the law department at Ann Arbor. Darrow only studied there a year when he decided that it would be much more cost-effective to work and study in an actual law office. When he felt that he was ready, he took the Ohio bar exam and passed.&lt;ref name="Darrow 1932"&gt;{{cite book|last=Darrow|first=Clarence|title=The Story of My Life|year=1932|publisher=Grosset and Dunlap|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was admitted to the Ohio bar in 1878. The [[Clarence Darrow Octagon House]], his childhood home in Kinsman, contains a memorial to him.

===Marriages and child===
Darrow married Jessie Ohl in April 1880. They had one child, Paul Edward Darrow, in 1883. They were divorced in 1897. Darrow later married Ruby Hammerstrom, a journalist 16 years his junior, in 1903. They had no children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Clarence Darrow- Early Life and Law Career|url=http://law.jrank.org/pages/12186/Darrow-Clarence-Early-life-law-career.html|website=jrank|accessdate=April 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal career==

Darrow opened his first little law office in [[Andover, Ohio]], a small farming town just ten miles from Kinsman. Having little to no experience, he started off slowly and gradually built up his career by dealing with the everyday complaints and problems of a farming community. After two years Darrow felt he was ready to take on new and different cases and moved his practice to [[Ashtabula, Ohio]], which had a population of 5,000 people and was the largest city in the county.&lt;ref name="Darrow 1932"/&gt; There he became involved in Democratic Party politics and served as the town counsel.

In 1880, he married Jessie Ohl, and eight years later he moved to Chicago with his wife and young son, Paul. He did not have much business when he first moved to Chicago, and spent as little as possible. He joined the Henry George Club and made some friends and connections in the city. Being part of the club also gave him an opportunity to speak for the Democratic Party on the upcoming election. He slowly made a name for himself through these speeches, eventually earning the standing to speak in whatever hall he liked. He was offered work as an attorney for the city of Chicago. Darrow worked in the city law department for two years when he resigned and took a position as a lawyer at the Chicago and North-Western Railway Company.&lt;ref name="Darrow 1932"/&gt; In 1894, Darrow represented [[Eugene V. Debs]], the leader of the [[American Railway Union]], who was prosecuted by the federal government for leading the [[Pullman Strike]] of 1894. Darrow severed his ties with the railroad to represent Debs, making a financial sacrifice. He saved Debs in one trial but could not keep him from being jailed in another.

Also in 1894, Darrow took on the first murder case of his career, defending [[Patrick Eugene Prendergast]], the "mentally deranged drifter" who had confessed to murdering Chicago mayor [[Carter Harrison, Sr.]]&lt;ref name="answers.com"&gt;[http://www.answers.com/topic/clarence-darrow Clarence Darrow: Biography and Much More from Answers.com&lt;!-- bot-generated title --&gt;] at www.answers.com&lt;/ref&gt; Darrow's "insanity defense" failed and Prendergast was executed that same year. Among fifty defenses in murder cases throughout the whole of Darrow's career, the Prendergast case would prove to be the only one resulting in an execution, though Darrow did not join the defense team until after Prendergast's conviction and sentence, in an effort to spare him the noose.&lt;ref name="answers.com"/&gt;

===From corporate lawyer to labor lawyer===

Darrow soon became one of America's leading labor attorneys. He helped organize the [[People's Party (United States)|Populist Party]] in Illinois and then ran for U.S. Congress as a Democrat in 1895 but lost to [[Hugh R. Belknap]]. In 1897, his marriage to Jessie Ohl ended in divorce. He joined the [[American Anti-Imperialist League|Anti-Imperialist League]] in 1898 in opposition to the [[Governor-General of the Philippines#United States Military Government (1898–1901)|U.S. annexation of the Philippines]]. He represented the woodworkers of Wisconsin in a notable case in Oshkosh in 1898 and the [[United Mine Workers of America|United Mine Workers]] in Pennsylvania in the [[coal strike of 1902|great anthracite coal strike of 1902]]. He flirted with the idea of running for mayor of Chicago in 1903 but ultimately decided against it. The following year, in July, Darrow married Ruby Hammerstrom, a young Chicago journalist.&lt;ref&gt;Passport application, accessed through familysearch.org&lt;/ref&gt; His former mentor, Governor [[John Peter Altgeld]], joined Darrow's firm following his Chicago mayoral electoral defeat in 1899 and worked with Darrow until his death in 1902.

[[File:ClarenceDarrow1902.PNG|thumb|Clarence Darrow in 1902&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Donovan|first1=Henry|title=Chicago Eagle|url=http://idnc.library.illinois.edu/cgi-bin/illinois?a=d&amp;d=CHE19021220&amp;e=-------en-20--1--txt-txIN-------#|website=Illinois Digital Newspaper Collections|accessdate=July 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
From 1906 to 1908, Darrow represented the [[Western Federation of Miners]] leaders [[William "Big Bill" Haywood]], [[Charles Moyer]], and [[George Pettibone]] when they were arrested and charged with conspiring to murder former Idaho Governor [[Frank Steunenberg]] in 1905. Haywood and Pettibone were found not guilty in separate trials, and the charges against Moyer were then dropped.

In 1911, the [[American Federation of Labor]] (AFL) called on Darrow to defend the [[McNamara brothers]], John and James, who were charged in the [[Los Angeles Times bombing|Los Angeles ''Times'' bombing]] on October 1, 1910, during the bitter struggle over the [[open shop]] in Southern California. The bomb had been placed in an alley behind the building, and although the explosion itself did not bring the building down, it ignited nearby ink barrels and natural gas main lines. In the ensuing fire, 20 people were killed. The AFL appealed to local, state, regional and national unions to donate 25 cents per capita to the defense fund, and set up defense committees in larger cities throughout the nation to accept donations.

In the weeks before the jury was seated, Darrow became increasingly concerned about the outcome of the trial and began negotiations for a plea bargain to spare the defendants' lives. During the weekend of November 19–20, 1911, he discussed with pro-labor journalist [[Lincoln Steffens]] and newspaper publisher [[E.W. Scripps]] the possibility of reaching out to the ''Times'' about the terms of a plea agreement. The prosecution had demands of its own, however, including an admission of guilt in open court and longer sentences than the defense proposed.&lt;ref name="Darrow"&gt;Darrow, Clarence. ''The Story of My Life'', 1932. [http://gutenberg.net.au/ebooks05/0500951h.html Project Guttenberg.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Foner"&gt;Foner, Phillip S. ''History of the Labor Movement in the United States: The AFL in the Progressive Era, 1910–1915'', 1980.&lt;/ref&gt;

The defense's position weakened when, on November 28, Darrow was accused of orchestrating to bribe a prospective juror. The juror reported the offer to police, who set up a sting and observed the defense team's chief investigator, Bert Franklin, delivering $4,000 to the juror two blocks away from Darrow's office. After making payment, Franklin walked one block in the direction of Darrow's office before being arrested right in front of Darrow himself, who had just walked to that very intersection after receiving a phone call in his office. With Darrow himself on the verge of being discredited, the defense's hope for a simple plea agreement ended.&lt;ref name="Farrell"&gt;Farrell, John A. "[http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history-archaeology/Clarence-Darrow-Jury-Tamperer.html Darrow in the Dock]". ''Smithsonian Magazine'', December 2011, Volume 42, Number 8, pp. 98–111.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cowan"&gt;Cowan, ''The People v. Clarence Darrow: The Bribery Trial of America's Greatest Lawyer'', 1994&lt;/ref&gt; On December 1, 1911, the McNamara brothers changed their pleas to guilty, in open court. The plea bargain Darrow helped arrange earned John fifteen years and James life imprisonment. Despite sparing the brothers the death penalty, Darrow was accused by many in organized labor of selling the movement out.

Two months later, Darrow was charged with two counts of attempting to bribe jurors in both cases. He faced two lengthy trials. In the first, defended by [[Earl Rogers]], he was acquitted. Rogers became ill during the second trial and rarely came to court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cowan|first=Geoffrey|title=The People V. Clarence Darrow: The Bribery Trial of America's Greatest Lawyer|year=1993|publisher=Random House|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; Darrow served as his own attorney for the remainder of the trial, which ended with a [[hung jury]]. A deal was struck in which the district attorney agreed not to retry Darrow if he promised not to practice law again in California.&lt;ref&gt;see in "Clarence Darrow: A Sentimental Rebel" by Arthur and Lila Weinberg.&lt;/ref&gt; Darrow's early biographers, [[Irving Stone]] and Arthur and Lila Weinberg, asserted that he was not involved in the bribery conspiracy, but more recently, Geoffrey Cowan and John A. Farrell, with the help of new evidence, concluded that he almost certainly was.&lt;ref name="Farrell" /&gt; In the biography of Earl Rogers by his daughter [[Adela Rogers St. Johns|Adela]], she wrote: "I never had any doubts, even before one of my father's private conversations with Darrow included an admission of guilt to his lawyer."&lt;ref&gt;Adela Rogers St. Johns: ''Final Verdict'', (Doubleday, 1962) 457.&lt;/ref&gt;

===From labor lawyer to criminal lawyer===

[[File:Clarence Darrow cph.3b31130.jpg|thumb|upright|Darrow in 1913]]

As a consequence of the bribery charges, most labor unions dropped Darrow from their list of preferred attorneys. This effectively put Darrow out of business as a labor lawyer, and he switched to civil and criminal cases. He took the latter because he had become convinced that the criminal justice system could ruin people's lives if they were not adequately represented.&lt;ref name="Riggenbach"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Riggenbach|first=Jeff|title=Clarence Darrow on Freedom, Justice, and War |journal=Mises Daily |publisher=[[Ludwig von Mises Institute]] |date=March 25, 2011|url=https://mises.org/daily/5147/Clarence-Darrow-on-Freedom-Justice-and-War}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout his career, Darrow devoted himself to opposing the [[capital punishment in the United States|death penalty]], which he felt to be in conflict with [[Humanitarianism|humanitarian]] progress. In more than 100 cases, Darrow only lost one murder case in Chicago. He became renowned for moving juries and even judges to tears with his eloquence. Darrow had a keen intellect often hidden by his rumpled, unassuming appearance.

A July 23, 1915, article in the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' describes Darrow's effort on behalf of J.H. Fox, an [[Evanston, Illinois]], landlord, to have Mary S. Brazelton committed to an insane asylum against the wishes of her family. Fox alleged that Brazelton owed him rent money, although other residents of Fox's boarding house testified to her sanity.

===National renown===

====Leopold and Loeb====

In the summer of 1924, Darrow took on the case of [[Leopold and Loeb|Nathan Leopold Jr. and Richard Loeb]], the teenage sons of two wealthy Chicago families who were accused of kidnapping and killing [[Bobby Franks]], a 14-year-old boy, from their stylish southside [[Kenwood, Chicago|Kenwood]] neighborhood. Leopold was a law student at the [[University of Chicago]] about to transfer to [[Harvard Law School]], and Loeb was the youngest graduate ever from the University of Michigan; they were 18 and 17, respectively, when they were arrested.&lt;ref name="Darrow 1932"/&gt; When asked why they committed the crime, Leopold told his captors: "The thing that prompted Dick to want to do this thing and prompted me to want to do this thing was a sort of pure love of excitement... the imaginary love of thrills, doing something different... the satisfaction and the ego of putting something over."

Chicago newspapers labeled the case the "[[Trial of the Century]]"&lt;ref&gt;[http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/trials5.htm JURIST – The Trial of Leopold and Loeb] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101103143040/http://www.jurist.law.pitt.edu/trials5.htm |date=November 3, 2010 }}, Prof. Douglas Linder. Retrieved November 2, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; and Americans around the country wondered what could drive the two young men, blessed with everything their society could offer, to commit such a depraved act. The killers had been arrested after a passing workman spotted the victim's body in an isolated nature preserve near the Indiana border just half a day after it was hidden, before they could collect a $10,000 ransom. Nearby were Leopold's eyeglasses with their distinctive, traceable frames, which he had dropped at the scene.

Leopold and Loeb made full confessions and took police on a hunt around Chicago to collect the evidence that would be used against them. The state's attorney told the press that he had a "hanging case" for sure. Darrow stunned the prosecution when he had his clients plead guilty in order to avoid a vengeance-minded jury and place the case before a judge. The trial, then, was actually a long sentencing hearing in which Darrow contended, with the help of expert testimony, that Leopold and Loeb were mentally diseased.

Darrow's closing argument lasted 12 hours. He repeatedly stressed the ages of the "boys" (before the Vietnam War, the age of majority was 21) and noted that "never had there been a case in Chicago where on a plea of guilty a boy under 21 had been sentenced to death." His plea was designed to soften the heart of Judge John Caverly, but also to mold public opinion, so that Caverly could follow precedent without too huge an uproar. Darrow succeeded. Caverly sentenced Leopold and Loeb to life in prison plus 99 years. Darrow's closing argument was published in several editions in the late 1920s and early 1930s, and was reissued at the time of his death.&lt;ref name="Riggenbach" /&gt;

The Leopold and Loeb case raised, in a well-publicized trial, Darrow's lifelong contention that psychological, physical, and environmental influences—not a conscious choice between right and wrong—control human behavior. Darrow's psychiatric expert witnesses testified that both boys "were decidedly deficient in emotion". Darrow later argued that emotion is necessary for the decisions that people make. When someone tries to go against a certain law or custom that is forbidden, he wrote, he should feel a sense of revulsion. As neither Leopold nor Loeb had a working emotional system, they did not feel revolted.&lt;ref name="Darrow 1932"/&gt;

During the trial, the newspapers claimed that Darrow was presenting a "million dollar defense" for the two wealthy families. Many ordinary Americans were angered at his apparent greed. He had the families issue a statement insisting that there would be no large legal fees and that his fees would be determined by a committee composed of officers from the [[Chicago Bar Association]]. After trial, Darrow suggested $200,000 would be reasonable. After lengthy negotiations with the defendants' families, he ended up getting some $70,000 in gross fees, which, after expenses and taxes, netted Darrow $30,000, worth over $375,000 in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;''See'', A. Weinberg, ed., ''Attorney for the Damned'', pp. 17–18, n. 1 (Simon &amp; Schuster, 1957)); Hulbert papers, Northwestern University.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Scopes Trial====

[[File:Clarence S Darrow.jpg|thumb|right|Clarence Darrow circa 1925]]

In 1925, Darrow defended [[John T. Scopes]] in the ''[[Scopes Trial|State of Tennessee v. Scopes]]'' trial. It has often been called the "Scopes Monkey Trial," a title popularized by author and journalist [[H.L. Mencken]]. The trial, which was deliberately staged to bring publicity to the issue at hand, pitted Darrow against [[William Jennings Bryan]] in a court case that tested Tennessee's [[Butler Act]], which had been passed on March 21, 1925. The act forbade the teaching of "the [[evolution|Evolution Theory]]" in any state-funded educational establishment. More broadly, it outlawed in state-funded schools (including universities) the teaching of "any theory that denies the story of the [[creationism|Divine Creation]] of man as taught in the [[Bible]], and to teach instead that man has descended from a lower order of animals."

During the trial, Darrow requested that Bryan be called to the stand as an expert witness on the [[Bible]]. Over the other prosecutor's objection, Bryan agreed. Popular media{{cn|date=August 2018}} at the time portrayed the following exchange as the deciding factor that turned public opinion against Bryan in the trial:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
:Darrow: "You have given considerable study to the Bible, haven't you, Mr. Bryan?"
:Bryan: "Yes, sir; I have tried to.... But, of course, I have studied it more as I have become older than when I was a boy."
:Darrow: "Do you claim then that everything in the Bible should be literally interpreted?"
:Bryan: "I believe that everything in the Bible should be accepted as it is given there; some of the Bible is given illustratively. For instance: 'Ye are the salt of the earth.' I would not insist that man was actually salt, or that he had flesh of salt, but it is used in the sense of salt as saving God's people."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;!--  Commented out: [[Image:scopes trial.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Clarence Darrow and [[William Jennings Bryan]] chat in court during the [[Scopes Trial]].{{Deletable image-caption|date=March 2012}}]] --&gt;
After about two hours, Judge [[John T. Raulston]] cut the questioning short and on the following morning ordered that the whole session (which in any case the jury had not witnessed) be expunged from the record, ruling that the testimony had no bearing on whether Scopes was guilty of teaching evolution. Scopes was found guilty and ordered to pay the minimum fine of $100.

A year later, the [[Tennessee Supreme Court]] reversed the decision of the Dayton court on a procedural technicality—not on constitutional grounds, as Darrow had hoped. According to the court, the fine should have been set by the jury, not Raulston. Rather than send the case back for further action, however, the Tennessee Supreme Court dismissed the case. The court commented, "Nothing is to be gained by prolonging the life of this bizarre case."

The event led to a change in public sentiment and an increased discourse on the creation claims of religious teachers versus those of secular scientists {{mdash}} i.e., [[creationism]] compared to [[evolutionism]] {{mdash}} that still exist. It also became popularized in a play based loosely on the trial, ''[[Inherit the Wind (play)|Inherit the Wind]]'', which has been adapted several times on film and television.

====Ossian Sweet====
On September 9, 1925, a [[white people|white]] mob in Detroit attempted to drive a black family out of the home they had purchased in a white neighborhood. During the struggle, a white man was killed, and the eleven black men in the house were later arrested and charged with murder. [[Ossian Sweet]], a doctor, and three members of his family were brought to trial, and after an initial deadlock, Darrow argued to the [[all-white jury]]: "I insist that there is nothing but prejudice in this case; that if it was reversed and eleven white men had shot and killed a black man while protecting their home and their lives against a mob of blacks, nobody would have dreamed of having them indicted. They would have been given medals instead...." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=B. J.|first=Widick|title=Detroit: City of Race and Class Violence |edition=Revised|date=May 1, 1989|publisher=[[Wayne State University Press]]|location=Detroit, MI|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following a mistrial, it was agreed that each of the eleven defendants would be tried individually. Darrow, alongside Thomas Chawke, would first defend Ossian's brother Henry, who had confessed to firing the shot on Garland Street. Henry was found not guilty on grounds of [[Right of self-defense|self-defense]], and the prosecution determined to [[nolle prosequi|drop]] the charges on the remaining ten. The trials were presided over by [[Frank Murphy]], who went on to become [[Governor of Michigan]] and an [[Associate Justice]] of the [[Supreme Court of the United States]].&lt;ref&gt;*[[Kevin Boyle (historian)|Boyle, Kevin]], ''[[Arc of Justice]]: A Saga of Race, Civil Rights and Murder in the Jazz Age'' (Henry Holt &amp; Company, New York: 2004) ([[National Book Award]] Winner) {{ISBN|978-0-8050-7933-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
Darrow's closing statement, which lasted over seven hours, is seen as a landmark in the [[Civil Rights]] movement and was included in the book ''Speeches that Changed the World'' (given the name "I Believe in the Law of Love"). The two closing arguments of Clarence Darrow, from the first and second trials, show how he learned from the first trial and reshaped his remarks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= |url=http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/sweet/Summpage.html |title=Darrow's Summations in the Sweet Trials (1925 &amp;1926) |publisher=Law.umkc.edu |date=May 11, 1926 |accessdate=October 20, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100624025813/http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/FTrials/sweet/Summpage.html |archive-date=June 24, 2010 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Massie Trial====
The Scopes Trial and the Sweet trial were the last big cases that Darrow took on before he retired from full-time practice at the age of 68. He still took on a few cases such as the 1932 [[Massie Trial]] in Hawaii.

In his last headline-making case, the Massie Trial, Darrow, devastated by the [[Great Depression]], was hired by Eva Stotesbury, the wife of Darrow's old family friend [[Edward T. Stotesbury]], to come to the defense of [[Grace Fortescue]], [[Edward J. Lord]], Deacon Jones, and Thomas Massie, Fortescue's son-in-law, who were accused of murdering [[Joseph Kahahawai]]. Kahahawai had been accused, along with four other men, of raping and beating [[Thalia Massie]], Thomas's wife and Fortescue's daughter; the resulting 1931 case ended in a hung jury (though the charges were later dropped and repeated investigation has shown them to be innocent). Enraged, Fortescue and Massie then orchestrated the murder of Kahahawai in order to extract a confession and were caught by police officers while transporting his dead body.

Darrow entered the racially charged atmosphere as the lawyer for the defendants. Darrow reconstructed the case as a justified [[honor killing]] by Thomas Massie. Considered by ''[[The New York Times]]'' to be one of Darrow's three most compelling trials (along with the Scopes Trial and the Leopold and Loeb case), the case captivated the nation and most of white America strongly supported the honor killing defense. In fact, the final defense arguments were transmitted to the mainland through a special radio hookup. In the end, the jury came back with a unanimous verdict of guilty, but on the lesser crime of manslaughter.&lt;ref&gt;David Stannard.[http://the.honoluluadvertiser.com/article/2001/Oct/14/op/op03a.html "The Massie case: Injustice and courage"]. ''The Honolulu Advertiser'', October 14, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; As to Darrow's closing, one juror commented, "[h]e talked to us like a bunch of farmers. That stuff may go over big in the Middle West, but not here."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Stannard | first = David E. | authorlink = David Stannard | title = Honor Killing: Race, Rape, and Clarence Darrow's Spectacular Last Case | origyear = First published 2005 | year = 2006 | publisher = Penguin Group | isbn = 978-0-14-303663-0 | page = 382}}&lt;/ref&gt; Governor [[Lawrence Judd]] later commuted the sentences to one hour in his office.&lt;ref&gt;Page 86 {{cite web |url=http://darrow.law.umn.edu/Clarence_Darrow_Timeline.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=February 3, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131008005846/http://darrow.law.umn.edu/Clarence_Darrow_Timeline.pdf |archivedate=October 8, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Years later Deacon admitted to shooting Kahahawai; Massie was found "not Guilty" in a [[posthumous trial]].{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

==Religious beliefs==
==="Why I Am An Agnostic"===
As part of a public symposium on belief held in Columbus, Ohio, Darrow delivered a speech, later titled "Why I Am An Agnostic", on [[agnosticism]], skepticism, belief, and religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = The Essential Words and Writings of Clarence Darrow | year = 2007 | publisher = [[Modern Library]] | isbn = 978-0812966770 | page = 20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the speech, Darrow thoroughly discussed the meaning of being an agnostic and questioned the doctrines of [[Christianity]] and the [[Bible]]. He concluded that "the fear of God is not the beginning of wisdom. The fear of God is the death of wisdom. Skepticism and doubt lead to study and investigation, and investigation is the beginning of wisdom."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://darrow.law.umn.edu/documents/why_I_am_an_agnostic.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=October 15, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160221235533/http://darrow.law.umn.edu/documents/why_I_am_an_agnostic.pdf |archivedate=February 21, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mecca Temple Debate===
In January 1931 Darrow had a debate with English writer [[G. K. Chesterton]] during the latter's second trip to America. This was held at New York City's Mecca Temple. The topic was "Will the World Return to Religion?". At the end of the debate those in the hall were asked to vote for the man they thought had won the debate.

==Legacy==
Today, Clarence Darrow is remembered for his reputation as a fierce litigator who, in many cases, championed the cause of the underdog; because of this, he is generally regarded as one of the greatest criminal defense lawyers in American history.

According to legend, before he died, Darrow declared that if there was an [[afterlife]], he would return on the small bridge (now known as the Clarence Darrow Memorial Bridge) located just south of the [[Museum of Science and Industry (Chicago)|Museum of Science and Industry]] in [[Hyde Park, Chicago]] on the date of his death. Darrow was skeptical of a belief in life after death (he is reported to have said: "Every man knows when his life began... If I did not exist in the past, why should I, or could I, exist in the future?") but he made this promise to dissuade [[mediums]] from charging people money to "talk" to his spirit. People still gather on the bridge in the hopes of seeing his ghost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kogan|first1=Rick|title=Clarence Darrow's Words, if Not His Ghost, Still Linger in Jackson Park|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/ct-clarence-darrow-bridge-chicago-ae-0306-20160303-column.html|accessdate=November 16, 2016|date=March 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Plays===
* ''[[Clarence Darrow (film)|Darrow]]'', a full-length one-man play created after his death, featuring Darrow's reminiscences about his career. Originated by [[Henry Fonda]], many actors (including [[Leslie Nielsen]] and [[David Canary]]) have since taken on the role of Darrow in this play, which was adapted as ''[[Darrow (film)|Darrow]]'', a film starring [[Kevin Spacey]] and released by American Playhouse in 1991.
* ''[[Inherit the Wind (play)|Inherit the Wind]]'', a play (later adapted to the screen) which is a broadly fictionalized account of the [[Scopes Trial]]. Though the authors note that the 1925 trial was "clearly the genesis" of their play, they insist that the characters had "life and language of their own." They also mention that the issues raised in the play "have acquired new dimension and meaning", a possible reference to the political controversies of the 1950s. Still, they finish their foreword by inviting a more universal reading of the play:  "It might have been yesterday. It could be tomorrow."&lt;ref&gt;Jerome Lawrence and Robert E. Lee. ''Inherit the Wind''. Bantam, 1955.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Spencer Tracy]] played the Darrow character ("Henry Drummond") in the film, and Jason Robards too in a TV's remake in 1988.

On 11 April 1996, [[Lim Guan Eng]] had lodged, at the Sentul police headquarters, a police report titled “First Report On Financial Malpractices, Abuse Of Power, Corruption And Fraud In Perwaja Terengganu Sdn Bhd (Perwaja).”

On 2 January 2002, Chia filed a defamation suit against Lim, claiming that Lim had pictured him as corrupt and not qualified to serve the company. In his statement of claim he said the report had severely damaged his reputation as a well-known businessman and sought general and aggravated damages and other relief deemed fit by the court.

On 1 March 2002, Lim entered his statement of defence stating that he relied on qualified privilege.

On 22 April 2009, Jega Kumar &amp; Associates filed a notice of discontinuance of Chia’s suit.

On 27 April 2009, almost a year after Chia died, High Court Deputy Registrar, Norazlin Othman, in chambers, granted the application by counsel for the late Tan Sri Eric Chia Eng Hock to withdraw a defamation suit against DAP secretary-general Lim Guan Eng.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2009/4/27/nation/20090427163051&amp;sec=nation Withdrawn: Eric Chia suit vs Guan Eng], The Star Monday 27 April 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eric Chia wthdraws defamation suit ..., The New Straits Times, 27 April 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Esta Henry''' or '''Esther Henry''' (1883–1963) was an antique dealer in [[Edinburgh, Scotland]]. Born in [[Newcastle-upon-Tyne]], in her time she was the subject of news stories in many countries and known for her eccentric behavior. Sometimes called "Mrs. Scotland"&lt;ref name="Sydney"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1301&amp;dat=19580803&amp;id=oHdWAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=8OQDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4118,881090 | title='Mrs Scotland' has an eye for a royal bargain | date=3 August 1958 | agency=The Sydney Morning Herald | accessdate=2013-04-12 | author=Kitchener, Pamela | location=Sydney | pages=39}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the press, she had ties to a number of notable people and events, including British queens and the auction of the collections of [[Farouk of Egypt|King Farouk of Egypt]].

==Henry's shop==
[[File:Moubray House and John Knox's House, High Street Edinburgh.jpg|thumb|Moubray House (to the left) and [[John Knox House]] on the High Street, near the [[Netherbow Port]], on the [[Royal Mile]], Edinburgh.]]
Henry ran an antiques business out of a shop called ''The Luckenbooth''&lt;ref name="Divided"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ITasAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22esther+henry%22&amp;dq=%22esther+henry%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Z-1tUdOyBYfiiAKDmoHQBA&amp;ved=0CE4Q6AEwBjgo | title=Edinburgh divided: John Cormack and no popery in the 1930's | publisher=Polygon | author=Gallagher, Tom | year=1987 | pages=111, 147 | isbn=9780948275401}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Campbell"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=cfaW7pkoPioC&amp;pg=PA235&amp;lpg=PA235&amp;dq=1953+%22esther+henry%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=QH5FWAeM0H&amp;sig=T3f99jf5CumsUTL_DHdHSqZFyZc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=0qFtUciBAarCigL33IG4DQ&amp;ved=0CE8Q6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=1953%20%22esther%20henry%22&amp;f=false | title=Edinburgh: A Cultural and Literary History | publisher=Signal Books | author=Campbell, Donald | year=2003 | pages=277 | isbn=9781902669731}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Moubray House]], the oldest building on the [[Royal Mile]] in Edinburgh. A [[luckenbooth]] is a heart-shaped Scottish brooch named for the shops in the [[Luckenbooths]] tenements where jewelry was once sold. Moubray House is next to the [[John Knox House]]&lt;ref name="Sydney" /&gt; and is the oldest occupied building in the city. Most records state that [[Moubray House#The Moubrays|Robert Moubray]] built the original house in 1477. The property itself has gone through many rebuilds and renovations and was gifted to [[Historic Scotland]], the association responsible for historic monuments, in 2012.&lt;ref name="Gifted"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-edinburgh-east-fife-19378911 | title=Edinburgh's Moubray House to be gifted to Historic Scotland | publisher=BBC | date=25 August 2012 | accessdate=2013-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The antique shop on the Royal Mile was "a favourite haunt" of [[Mary of Teck|Queen Mary (Mary of Teck)]], and visited by [[Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother|the Queen (Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother)]] and [[Princess Margaret, Countess of Snowdon|Princess Margaret]], in 1948. During the visit, Esta Henry took them to see the flat above the shop in Moubray House, where the Queen Mother said she "would like to live on the Royal Mile".&lt;ref name="Royal"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2507&amp;dat=19480706&amp;id=J2pAAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=hJgMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6280,3433103 | title=Royal Family Leave Edinburgh | date=6 July 1948 | agency=The Glasgow Herald | accessdate=2013-04-12 | location=Glasgow, Scotland | pages=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jewelry theft==
On 1 May 1953, £650 of the "Hungarian crown jewels collection" was stolen from Henry's shop. The gems were later found at 22 St. Stephen's road in [[Canterbury]]. Henry agreed to pay £15 to the owner of the shop, Barnett Lee, to recover her property. The [[Aquamarine (gemstone)#Aquamarine and maxixe|aquamarine]], diamond and [[platinum]] brooch was sold to Lee (in parts) for £60, by one of two men who had been sentenced at the [[High Court of Justiciary|High Court in Edinburgh]] for the theft.&lt;ref name="Recovered"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2507&amp;dat=19531219&amp;id=rkdAAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=vYgMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2799,4983477 | title=£15 To Recover Stolen Gems | date=19 December 1953 | agency=The Glasgow Herald | accessdate=2013-04-14 | location=Glasgow | pages=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is possible that these items were stolen from Henry by [[Archibald Hall]], alias Roy Fontaine. Although he was caught and jailed for his crimes, Hall used the proceeds of his thefts in Scotland to move to London. In England he became infamous for infiltrating high class society, committing robberies, and killing a number of his targets. In 1978, Hall was found guilty of murder and sentenced to two life-terms. He died in [[Kingston Prison]], Portsmouth in 2002. A screenplay for a film about Hall, called ''[[Monster Butler]]'', was written by [[Peter Bellwood]].&lt;ref name="Monster"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.scotsman.com/lifestyle/film/shortage-of-cash-proves-fatal-for-serial-killer-film-monster-butler-1-2643212 | title=Shortage of cash proves fatal for serial killer film ‘Monster Butler’ | publisher=Scotsman | date=17 November 2012 | accessdate=2013-04-14 | author=McGinty, Stephen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to A. M. Nicol in the 2011 book, ''The Monster Butler'', Hall claimed that he planned the theft that was Scotland's biggest jewel robbery. He devised a scheme with his accomplice, John Wootton, whom he met in prison. Together they took approximately £100,000 in goods from a tin box at the back of Henry's shop and went to [[Torquay]]. After hiding some of the jewels, they were arrested and sent to Edinburgh. Nicol writes, "the prosecution offered them a deal which involved the true value of the jewels not being made public". Nicol posits that Hall's story is a fabrication and the actual was an "opportunistic sneak theft" for a great deal less value.&lt;ref name="Nicol"&gt;{{cite book | url=http://www.peoplesbookprize.com/Extracts/i662.extract.pdf | title=The Monster Butler | publisher=Black &amp; White Publishing | author=Nicol, A.M. | year=2011 | pages=10–11, 69–74 | isbn=9781845023362}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==King Farouk's auction==
[[Farouk of Egypt|Farouk I of Egypt]] was the king of Egypt and Sudan, following his father Fuad I of Egypt, in 1936. He was known for his extensive collection including decorated [[horological]] instruments, coins and pornographic art. In 1952, Farouk was deposed by the Egyptian government. His collections were auctioned in February 1954&lt;ref name="Numismatist"&gt;{{cite press release | url=http://www.pcgs.com/books/abekosoff/Chapter8-001.aspx | title=Cairo | publisher=The Numismatist | date=January 1954 | accessdate=2013-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; to return the money spent by Farouk to Egypt's treasury. News of the auction was reported throughout the world, and Henry was the subject of a number of these articles.&lt;ref name="Auld"&gt;{{cite journal | url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=qZjmAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22esta+henry%22+edinburgh&amp;dq=%22esta+henry%22+edinburgh&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=3O5tUZLwGuTrigKfs4CQCw&amp;ved=0CE8Q6AEwBA | title='Auld Reekie' | author=British Broadcasting Corporation | journal=London Calling | year=1962 | volume=2 | issue=240–303 | pages=239}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sotheby's"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=2LqfAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22esta+henry%22+edinburgh&amp;dq=%22esta+henry%22+edinburgh&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=3O5tUZLwGuTrigKfs4CQCw&amp;ved=0CEAQ6AEwAQ | title=Sotheby's, portrait of an auction house | publisher=Chatto &amp; Windus | author=Herrmann, Frank | year=1980}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The auction was run by the new government, not professional auctioneers, which resulted in unusual circumstances. During the auction, Henry protested that she could not see and left the salesroom; the supervisors followed her to make amends. Two days earlier, Henry insisted that they conduct the auction in English as well as French and Eqyptian, and they complied.&lt;ref name="Straits"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://newspapers.nl.sg/Digitised/Page/straitstimes19540313-1.1.3.aspx | title=They chased her around Cairo to sell her Farouk's antiques | date=13 March 1954 | agency=The Straits Times | accessdate=2013-04-21 | pages=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; At one point Henry grabbed a clock from the stand in the middle of bidding,&lt;ref name="Time"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article27202224?searchTerm=esta%20henry&amp;searchLimits= | title=She took her time | date=15 March 1954 | agency=Australian Associated Press | accessdate=2013-04-21 | pages=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; "When I saw it I rushed up and shouted, lay off—this is for Scotland. If any twister breaks my bid I'll break his neck."&lt;ref name="Sydney" /&gt;

Henry spent over 10,000 pounds sterling at the auction held at the [[Koubbeh Palace]] in Cairo,&lt;ref name="Sydney" /&gt; and purchased some items made in Britain; "It gives me pleasure to see rare treasures in their rightful places", she said. One of these was a star shaped watch made by [[David Ramsay (watchmaker)|David Ramsay]] in the 17th century.&lt;ref name="Sydney" /&gt;

During the trip, Henry spoke to a group of women who were holding a starvation strike at the Cairo Press Club to gain the right to vote. The women were members of Daughters of the Nile ([[Feminism in Egypt#Egyptian feminism after World War II|Bint El Nil]]), led by 36-year-old [[Doria Shafik]].&lt;ref name="DoN"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article49622934 | title=Pep Talk | date=16 March 1954 | agency=The West Australian | accessdate=2013-04-14 | location=Perth | pages=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Henry claimed to have started in the antique business 'shoving a hawker's barrow out of Jane Street'&lt;ref name="Field"&gt;{{cite journal | url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ohgiAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22esta+henry%22+edinburgh&amp;dq=%22esta+henry%22+edinburgh&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=3O5tUZLwGuTrigKfs4CQCw&amp;ved=0CFwQ6AEwBw | title=Edinburgh | author=Holmes McDougall | journal=Scottish Field | year=1985 | volume=131}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the age of 9, "I started with a pushbike and 30 bob, I lived in one room which was also the shop."&lt;ref name="Sydney" /&gt;

Henry performed secret acts of charity to local families, and was elected councillor to Edinburgh of one of the [[The Canongate|Canongate]] wards in 1936. Although she was Jewish, Henry had campaigned under a [[Protestant Action Society|Protestant Action]] banner, supporting Protestant leader John Cormack.&lt;ref name="Campbell" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Uneasy"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Xxy8AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA165&amp;dq=%22esther+henry%22+edinburgh&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=WO5tUc2vCoKoigLihoDICg&amp;ved=0CDwQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=%22esther%20henry%22%20edinburgh&amp;f=false | title=Glasgow: The Uneasy Peace : Religious Tension in Modern Scotland, 1819–1914 | publisher=Manchester University Press | author=Gallagher, T. | year=1987 | pages=165 | isbn=9780719023965}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Modern"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=x55nAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22esther+henry%22&amp;dq=%22esther+henry%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ju1tUZHGFImIiwKl4oGIBw&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwATg8 | title=Readings 1850 to the Present Volume 4 of Modern Scottish History 1707 to the Present | publisher=Tuckwell Press, in association with the Open University in Scotland and the University of Dundee |author1=Cooke, Anthony  |author2=Donnachie, Ian | year=1998 | pages=186 | isbn=9781862320833}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Shortly after her election Cormack announced he and Henry would stand for Parliament [[United Kingdom general election, 1945|at the next UK general election]], but in fact Henry soon left Protestant Action.&lt;ref name="Parliament"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Kenneth Baxter|editor1-last=Macdonald|editor1-first=Stuart|editor2-last=MacLeod|editor2-first=Daniel|title=Keeping the Kirk Scottish Religion at Home and in the Diaspora|date=2014|publisher=Centre for Scottish Studies, University of Guelph|location=Guelph|page=205|chapter=Gender, Militant Protestantism and Local Politics in Interwar Scotland}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tom Gallagher believes Henry was not anti-Catholic, but joined Protestant Action as a means to become a councillor. Kenneth Baxter concurs with this view noting among other evidence the facts that she had previously sought election to Edinburgh Council as 'Moderate/Progressive' candidate without success on five previous occasions and in October 1936 had been intending to stand as an 'Independent Progressive'.&lt;ref name="Gallagher&amp;Baxter"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Kenneth Baxter|editor1-last=Macdonald|editor1-first=Stuart|editor2-last=MacLeod|editor2-first=Daniel|title=Keeping the Kirk Scottish Religion at Home and in the Diaspora|date=2014|publisher=Centre for Scottish Studies, University of Guelph|location=Guelph|page=219|chapter=Gender, Militant Protestantism and Local Politics in Interwar Scotland}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Henry was widowed in 1947 at the age of 64, and left with 2 daughters and 3 sons.&lt;ref name="Love"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://newspapers.nl.sg/Digitised/Article/freepress19530108-1.2.54.aspx | title=Widow of 70, and Her 'Love for Paul' | date=8 January 1953 | agency=The Singapore Free Press | accessdate=2013-04-14 | location=Singapore | pages=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1953, a Romanian art dealer named Pinchas Haimovici was held in [[HM Prison Edinburgh|Saughton Prison]], Edinburgh, pending deportation for entering the country on a false passport with the name Paul Eugene Dillon (a Belgian named Paul Dijon in other sources&lt;ref name="Campbell" /&gt;).&lt;ref name="Love" /&gt; Esta Henry previously met Haimovici, who was 20 years her junior, when he came into her shop in Moubray House. She did not believe his claims and determined to help him, after which he surrendered voluntarily to the court.&lt;ref name="Campbell" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Love" /&gt; After his release by the Sheriff Court, he was arrested again as an alien to be deported. Haimovici appealed the order made by the [[Home Secretary]], claiming that he would be put to death as [[anti-Communist]] if he was returned to Romania.&lt;ref name="Glasgow"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2507&amp;dat=19530425&amp;id=fEtAAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=jVkMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3629,6006733 | title=Roumanian (sic) Art Dealer Freed | date=25 April 1953 | agency=The Glasgow Herald | accessdate=2013-04-12 | location=Glasgow | pages=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Henry declared that she "loved Paul" and she would marry him and take care of all his financial needs (presumably to legalize his position in Scotland).&lt;ref name="Love" /&gt; They married shortly after his second release and Haimovici changed his name to Paul Henry.&lt;ref name="Gaol"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://newspapers.nl.sg/Digitised/Article.aspx?articleid=freepress19530505-1.2.66&amp;sessionid=cc6932646bb84dcf87cafc1c929f1eea&amp;keyword=%22esta+henry%22&amp;token=henry%2cesta | title=He quits gaol-and finds his bride | date=5 May 1953 | agency=The Singapore Free Press | accessdate=2013-04-16 | location=Singapore | pages=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Italic title}}
The '''''exceptio non adimpleti contractus''''' is a [[Defense (legal)|defence]] that can be raised in the case of a reciprocal [[contract]]. In essence, it is a remedy that allows a party to withhold his own performance, accompanied by a right to ward off a claim for such performance until the other party has duly performed his or her [[obligations]] under the contract.

==Requirements for the ''exceptio non adimpleti contractus''==
Two requirements must be met in order for the ''exceptio non adimpleti contractus'' to be available. The two performances must be reciprocal to one another; and the other party must be obliged to perform first.

The '''ExxonMobil Building''' (formerly the '''Humble Building''') was built in 1963 in [[Houston]]. At that time it was the tallest building west of the [[Mississippi River]] at {{convert|606|ft|m|abbr=on}}, surpassing the [[Sheraton Dallas Hotel|Southland Center]] in [[Dallas]] (the previous record holder). It remained the tallest building west of the Mississippi only until 1965, when [[The Drever|Elm Place]] was built in Dallas.

As of 2011, [[ExxonMobil]] is the owner of the building.&lt;ref name="Connelly"&gt;Connelly, Richard.

Retrieved on March 4, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most distinctive features of the building is the [[cantilever]]ed seven-foot-wide shades ({{convert|7|ft|disp=output only}}) on each floor that protrude from the side of the building to provide shade from the daytime sun.

Currently, the [[JPMorgan Chase Tower (Houston)|JPMorgan Chase Tower]], completed in 1982 is [[List of tallest buildings in Houston|Houston's tallest building]], and the tallest building in Texas, at {{convert|1002|ft|m|abbr=on}}.

The building is two blocks east of [[1500 Louisiana Street]]; a parking lot is between the two buildings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Nancy Sarnoff| title=ExxonMobil may be frontrunner for Enron Center South building | url=http://www.bizjournals.com/houston/stories/2002/02/11/newscolumn3.html | work=The Houston Business Journal | date=February 8, 2002 | accessdate=18 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The architect of the [[International style (architecture)|International style]] structure was [[Welton Becket|Welton Becket and Associates]].

During the [[Houston Astros]]' 2004 NLCS run (playoffs), the top of the building was crowned by hundreds of tiny blue lights while an enormous Astros star (logo) made of white lights was hung on the south side of the building.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author= | title=ExxonMobil Building 800 Bell St Houston, TX | url=http://www.thesquarefoot.com/buildings/tx/houston/77002/downtown/800-bell-street/exxon-mobil-building | publisher=TheSquareFoot | year=2013 | accessdate=19 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011 the company announced that all employees in the ExxonMobil building are moving to the new ExxonMobil office in [[Spring, Texas|Spring]]. ExxonMobil did not state what it plans to do with the building after the employees leave.&lt;ref name="Connelly"/&gt;

In January 2013, Shorenstein Properties announced it had closed on the property for an undisclosed amount. ExxonMobil immediately leased back the entire building into 2015. Shorenstien Properties plans to undertake significant improvements following ExxonMobil's departure.&lt;ref&gt;http://highrisefacilities.com/shorenstein-properties-completes-purchase-of-800-bell-street-in-houston/&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015 [[Mayor of Houston]] [[Annise Parker]] proposed moving municipal court and [[Houston Police Department]] operations into the ExxonMobil building. Charles McClelland, the head of HPD, stated that having so many law enforcement and public safety agencies concentrated in a single building may be a safety risk, citing the [[1995 Oklahoma City bombing]].&lt;ref&gt;Morris, Mike.

'''Feasibility Study''' is an assessment of the practicality of a proposed project or system.

== Overview ==
A feasibility study aims to objectively and rationally uncover the strengths and weaknesses of an existing business or proposed venture, opportunities and threats present in the [[natural environment]], the [[resources]] required to carry through, and ultimately the prospects for success.&lt;ref name="Justis"&gt;Justis, R. T. &amp; Kreigsmann, B. (1979). The feasibility study as a tool for venture analysis. ''Business Journal of Small Business Management'' 17 (1) 35-42.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Georgakellos, D. A. &amp; Marcis, A. M. (2009). Application of the semantic learning approach in the feasibility studies preparation training process. ''Information Systems Management'' 26 (3) 231-240.&lt;/ref&gt; In its simplest terms, the two criteria to judge feasibility are [[cost]] required and [[value (economics)|value]] to be attained.&lt;ref&gt;Young, G. I. M. (1970). Feasibility studies. ''Appraisal Journal'' 38 (3) 376-383.&lt;/ref&gt;

A well-designed feasibility study should provide a historical background of the business or project, a description of the [[Product (business)|product]] or [[Service (economics)|service]], accounting statements, details of the [[Business operations|operations]] and [[management]], [[marketing research]] and policies, financial data, legal requirements and tax obligations.&lt;ref name="Justis"/&gt; Generally, feasibility studies precede technical development and [[project]] implementation.

A feasibility study evaluates the project's potential for success; therefore, perceived objectivity is an important factor in the credibility of the study for potential investors and lending institutions.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}&lt;ref&gt;Feasibility studies as a tool for successful co-operative business enterprises {{Cite web|title = (A case study of the importance of Feasibility students to co-operative investment)|url = https://www.grossarchive.com/project/1796/FEASIBILITY-STUDIES-AS-A-TOOL-FOR-SUCCESSFUL-COPERATIVE-BUSINESS-INTERPRISES--A-CASE-STUDY-OF-THE-IMPORTANCE-OF-FEASIBILITY-STUDENTS-TO-CO-OPERATIVE-INVESTMENT-.html|website =grossarchive.com|accessdate = 2015-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; It must therefore be conducted with an objective, unbiased approach to provide information upon which decisions can be based.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

==Formal definition==

A project feasibility study is a comprehensive report that examines in detail the five frames of analysis of a given project. It also takes into consideration
its four Ps, its risks and POVs, and its constraints (calendar, costs, and norms of quality). The goal is to determine whether the project should go ahead, be redesigned, or else abandoned altogether.&lt;ref&gt; Mesly, Olivier. (2017). ''Project feasibility – Tools for uncovering points of vulnerability.'' New York, NY: Taylor and Francis, CRC Press. 546 pages. ISBN 9 781498 757911. See page 130.&lt;/ref&gt;. 

The five frames of analysis are: The frame of definition; the frame of contextual risks; the frame of potentiality; the parametric frame; the frame of dominant and contingency strategies.

The four Ps are traditionally defined as Plan, Processes, People, and Power. The risks are considered to be external to the project (e.g., weather conditions) and are divided in eight categories: (Plan) financial and organizational (e.g., government structure for a private project); (Processes) environmental and technological; (People) marketing and sociocultural; and (Power) legal and political. POVs are Points of Vulnerability: they differ from risks in the sense that they are internal to the project and can be controlled or else eliminated.

The constraints are the standard constraints of calendar, costs and norms of quality that can each be objectively determined and measured along the entire project lifecycle. Depending on projects, portions of the study may suffice to produce a feasibility study; smaller projects, for example, may not require an exhaustive environmental assessment.

== Common factors ==
The acronym [[TELOS (project management)|TELOS]] refers to the five areas of feasibility -  Technical, Economic, Legal, Operational and Scheduling.

===Technical feasibility===  
This assessment is based on an outline design of system requirements, to determine whether the company has the technical expertise to handle completion of the project.&lt;ref&gt;Blecke, Curtis. Financial Analysis for Decision making. Englewood Cliffs, N.J.: prentice-Hall, 1966&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Caiden, Naomi, and Aaron Wildovsky. planning and Budgeting in Poor Countries. New York: John Wiley and Sons, 1974&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pouliquen, Louis Y. Risk Analysis in Project Appraisal. World Bank Staff Occasional Papers, no. 11. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1970.&lt;/ref&gt; When writing a feasibility report, the following should be taken to consideration:
* A brief description of the business to assess more possible factors which could affect the study
* The part of the business being examined
* The human and economic factor
* The possible solutions to the problem    

At this level, the concern is whether the proposal is both ''technically'' and ''[[legally]]'' feasible (assuming moderate cost).{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

The technical feasibility assessment is focused on gaining an understanding of the present technical resources of the organization and their applicability to the expected needs of the proposed system.
It is an evaluation of the hardware and software and how it meets the need of the proposed system&lt;ref name="Management Information Systems 10e"&gt;O'Brien, J. A., &amp; Marakas, G. M. (2011). Developing Business/IT Solutions. In Management Information Systems (pp. 488-489). New York, NY: McGraw-Hill/Irwin.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Method of production ====
The selection among a number of methods to produce the same commodity should be undertaken first. Factors that make one method being preferred to other method in agricultural projects are the following:
* Availability of inputs or raw materials and their quality and prices. 
* Availability of markets for outputs of each method and the expected prices for these outputs.
* Various efficiency factors such as the expected increase in one additional unit of fertilizer or productivity of a specified crop per one dunum.

==== Production technique ====
After we determine the appropriate method of production of a commodity, it is necessary to look for the optimal technique to produce this commodity. 
 
==== Project requirements ====
Once the method of production and its technique are determined, technical people have to determine the projects' requirements during the investment and operating periods. These include:
* Determination of tools and equipment needed for the project such as drinkers and feeders or pumps or pipes …etc.
* Determination of projects' requirements of constructions such as buildings, storage, and roads …etc. in addition to internal designs for these requirements.
* Determination of projects' requirements of skilled and unskilled  labor and managerial and financial labor.
* Determination of construction period concerning the costs of designs and consultations and the costs of constructions and other tools.
* Determination of minimum storage of inputs, cash money to cope with operating and contingency costs.

==== Project location ====
The most important factors that determine the selection of project location are the following:
* Availability of land (proper acreage and reasonable costs). 
* The impact of the project on the environment and the approval of the concerned institutions for license.
* The costs of transporting inputs and outputs to the project's location (i.e., the distance from the markets).
* Availability of various services related to the project such as availability of extension services or veterinary or water or electricity or good roads ...etc.

===Legal feasibility===
It Determines whether the proposed system conflicts with legal requirements, e.g., a data processing system must comply with the local data protection regulations and if the proposed venture is acceptable in accordance to the laws of the land.

===Operational feasibility study===
Operational feasibility is the measure of how well a proposed system solves the problems, and takes advantage of the opportunities identified during scope definition and how it satisfies the requirements identified in the requirements analysis phase of system development.&lt;ref name="SAD-Global_Enterprise"&gt;Bentley, L &amp; Whitten, J (2007). ''System Analysis &amp; Design for the Global Enterprise''. 7th ed. (p. 417).&lt;/ref&gt;

The operational feasibility assessment focuses on the degree to which the proposed development project fits in with the existing business environment and objectives with regard to development schedule, delivery date, [[corporate culture]] and existing business processes.

To ensure success, desired operational outcomes must be imparted during design and development. These include such design-dependent parameters as reliability, maintainability, supportability, usability, producibility, disposability, sustainability, affordability and others. These parameters are required to be considered at the early stages of design if desired operational behaviours are to be realised. A system design and development requires appropriate and timely application of engineering and management efforts to meet the previously mentioned parameters. A system may serve its intended purpose most effectively when its technical and operating characteristics are engineered into the design. Therefore, operational feasibility is a critical aspect of systems engineering that needs to be an integral part of the early design phases.&lt;ref name="SE_and_Analysis"&gt;[[Benjamin S. Blanchard]] &amp; [[Wolt Fabrycky]] (uk). ''Systems Engineering &amp; Analysis ''. 5th ed. (p. 361).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Time feasibility===
A time feasibility study will take into account the period in which the project is going to take upto its completion. A project will fail if it takes too long to be completed before it is useful. Typically this means estimating how long the system will take to develop, and if it can be completed in a given time period using some methods like payback period. Time feasibility is a measure of how reasonable the project timetable is. Given our technical expertise, are the project deadlines reasonable? Some projects are initiated with specific deadlines. It is necessary to determine whether the deadlines are mandatory or desirable.

==Other feasibility factors==


===Resource feasibility===
Describe how much time is available to build the new system, when it can be built, whether it interferes with normal business operations, type and amount of resources required, dependencies,
and developmental procedures with company revenue prospectus.

===Financial feasibility===
In case of a new project, financial viability can be judged on the following parameters:

* Total estimated cost of the project
* Financing of the project in terms of its capital structure, debt to equity ratio and promoter's share of total cost
* Existing investment by the promoter in any other business
* Projected cash flow and profitability

The financial viability of a project should provide the following information:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.finance.gov.au/procurement/procurement-policy-and-guidance/buying/contract-issues/assessing-financial-viability/practice.html|title=ASSESSING FINANCIAL VIABILITY|first=Department of|last=Finance|date=30 October 2013|website=www.finance.gov.au}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Full details of the assets to be financed and how liquid those assets are.
* Rate of conversion to cash-liquidity (i.e., how easily the various assets can be converted to cash).
* Project's funding potential and repayment terms.
* Sensitivity in the repayments capability to the following factors:
** Mild slowing of sales.
** Acute reduction/slowing of sales.
** Small increase in cost.
** Large increase in cost.
** Adverse economic conditions.
In 1983 the first generation of the Computer Model for Feasibility Analysis and Reporting (COMFAR), a computation tool for financial analysis of investments, was released. Since then, this United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO) software has been developed to also support the economic appraisal of projects.
The COMFAR III Expert is intended as an aid in the analysis of investment projects. The main module of the program accepts financial and economic data, produces financial and economic statements and graphical displays and calculates measures of performance. Supplementary modules assist in the analytical process. Cost-benefit and value-added methods of economic analysis developed by UNIDO are included in the program and the methods of major international development institutions are accommodated. The program is applicable for the analysis of investment in new projects and expansion or rehabilitation of existing enterprises as, e.g., in the case of reprivatisation projects. For joint ventures, the financial perspective of each partner or class of shareholder can be developed. Analysis can be performed under a variety of assumptions concerning inflation, currency revaluation and price escalations.&lt;ref&gt;COMFAR III Expert Reference Manual United Nations Industrial Development Organisation.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Market research studies==
This is one of the most important sections of the feasibility study as it examines the marketability of the product or services and convinces readers that there is a potential market for the product or services.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} If a significant market for the product or services cannot be established, then there is no project.

Typically, market studies will assess the potential sales of the product, absorption and market capture rates and the project's timing.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

The feasibility study outputs the ''feasibility study report'', a report detailing the evaluation criteria, the study findings, and the recommendations.&lt;ref name="fsr"&gt;{{Citation| author=Michele Berrie|date=September 2008|url=http://www.pmhut.com/initiating-phase-feasibility-study-request-and-report| title=Initiating Phase - Feasibility Study Request and Report}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==As owner of Panathinaikos F.C.==
In the summer of 2000, the President of [[Panathinaikos FC|Panathinaikos]], [[Yiorgos Vardinogiannis]], resigned from his duties and sold his share to his nephew Giannis Vardinogiannis, who changed the style of management into the club. On 22 April 2008, main shareholder Vardinogiannis gave a press conference in which he announced the decision of his family to reduce their share in the club to 50% – after 30 years of full ownership – through a €800 million increase of the company's capital stock. After the negotiations and the share capital increase, the Vardinogiannis family would hold 56% of the club, Panathinaikos Athlitikos Omilos 10% and the rest shareholders 34%. The Vardinogiannis family finally withdrew from Panathinaikos in 2012. The team had the following successes as an owner of Panathinaikos:

- Quarter-finals in Champions League: 2001-02

- Quarter-finals in Uefa Cup: 2002-03

- Greek Championship: 2004, 2010

- Greek Cup: 2004, 2010

In February 2015 Vardinogiannis said in a statement to [[Reuters]] that the new Prime Minister of Greece [[Alexis Tsipras]] had a valid point in attacking the corrupted Greek oligarchs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Grey |first=Stephen |url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2015/02/17/uk-eurozone-greece-corruption-insight-idUKKBN0LL13K20150217 |title=Insight - PM Tsipras declares war at home on Greece's 'oligarchs' &amp;#124; Reuters |publisher=Uk.reuters.com |date=2015-02-17 |accessdate=2015-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the exhibition hosted by [[Katara (cultural village)|Katara]] in Ramadan 1434 A.H.(2013 A.D.), Al Fakhro took the opportunity to explain the strong association between the evolution of [[Islamic calligraphy|Arabic calligraphy]] and the spread of the [[Quran]]. The exhibition showcased copies of the Qur'an that were several hundred years old. The exhibition started with displaying the birth of Arabic calligraphy, followed by the appearance of innovative scripts, the addition of artistic finishes and gilding, and finally, printing. The exhibition ended with Mushaf Qatar and a few of the most beautiful printed copies of the Qur'an. Al Fakhro indicated that through his exhibition Arabic Calligraphy and Qur'an, a Shared Journey, he was keen to showcase a diversity of concepts represented by each and every displayed piece. He said that he wanted to tell the visitors different stories through these pieces.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.qatar-tribune.com/viewnews.aspx?n=0C8E7AD4-D01A-4FAC-A4AC-416676916A7B&amp;d=20130713 Qatar Tribune, 13/07/13, Arabic calligraphy &amp; Holy Quran expo begins.]&lt;/ref&gt;

This exhibition was held at [[Qatar Foundation]] convention center in September 2014. It included a rare assortment of artistic masterpieces from Engineer Ibrahim Al Fakhro's personal collection that portray the beauty of Arabic script.
The exhibition was staged in three main categories: the start of Arabic calligraphy, the evolution stage, and the modern stage. The exhibition shed the light on the diverse uses of the Arabic script, ranging from manuscripts and textiles to ceramics and coins. In display were coins dated back to the ninth and tenth centuries, including some that featured the works of prominent calligraphers such as [[Sheikh Hamdullah|Sheikh Hamdullah al-Amasi]] and [[Hâfiz Osman]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gulf-times.com/qatar/178/details/408173/qatar-foundation-exhibits-beauty-of-arabic-calligraphy Gulf Times, 14/09/14, Qatar Foundation exhibits beauty of Arabic calligraphy.]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3901">'''Institutional research''' is a broad category of work done at schools, colleges and universities to inform campus decision-making and planning in areas such as admissions, financial aid, curriculum assessment, enrollment management, staffing, student life, finance, facilities, athletics, and alumni relations.

Institutional researchers collect, analyze, report, and warehouse quantitative and qualitative data about their institution's students, faculty, staff, curriculum, course offerings, and learning outcomes. They are involved in collecting and reporting information to government bodies (for example, in the USA, the [[United States Department of Education]]'s [[Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System]]), to the public (e.g., [[Common Data Set]], the [[National Association of Independent Colleges and Universities]]'s  [http://www.ucan-network.org/ University-College Accountability Network]), and various college guide publishers (e.g., [[U.S. News &amp; World Report]] and [[College Board]]). On occasion, institutional researchers share data with one another to compare their own practices and outcomes against those of similar institutions. Institutional research is the source of much of the information provided to regional and national accreditation bodies to document how institutions fulfill the standards for accreditation.

In addition to reporting, institutional researchers often engage in data analysis, ranging from simply testing whether differences in reported data are statistically significant to developing and using causal and predictive statistical models.  Such models are often used in support of [[Educational assessment|assessment]] and [[Strategic Enrollment Management|strategic enrollment management]].

== Becoming an Institutional Researcher ==
Due to the need to provide data to the federal government and other entities, nearly every post-secondary institution has offices that fulfill the institutional research function. At some colleges and universities this function is centralized in a single office of institutional research, while at others it is more de-centralized. There is no single academic degree that qualifies one to be an institutional researcher, but suggested strengths include a knowledge of [[statistics]], [[research methods]] (e.g., [[survey research]] and [[focus groups]]), and computer-based reporting and data visualization tools (e.g., [[SPSS]], [[SAS System|SAS]], [[R_(programming_language)|R]], [[STATA]], [[Microsoft Access]], [[Microsoft Excel]], [[MicroStrategy]], and [[SQL]]). Other important assets are strong written and oral communications skills, attention to detail, and knowledge about how institutions of higher education operate. Several American universities offer graduate certificate programs in institutional research,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.airweb.org/Careers/GraduateEducation/Pages/default.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; including Ball State University, Florida State University, Humboldt State University,&lt;ref&gt;http://humboldt.edu/dee/ircertificate/&lt;/ref&gt; North Dakota State University, Penn State University, Indiana University, University of Missouri, University of Illinois, the University of Wisconsin - Stout &lt;ref&gt;http://www.uwstout.edu/programs/pdc/es.cfm&lt;/ref&gt;, and the University of California San Diego Extension. &lt;ref&gt;https://extension.ucsd.edu/courses-and-programs/institutional-research,&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Level 5 leader ===
Collins often discusses a "Level 5 leader" in his writings.  This refers to the peak of a five-tier hierarchy of [[leadership]] characteristics presented in the books.  A Level 5 Leader is someone who embodies a “paradoxical mix of personal humility and professional will&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/level-5-leadership.htm|title=Level 5 Leadership: Achieving "Greatness" as a Leader|access-date=2018-05-30|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;.”

Hovnanian''' (1923 – September 24, 2009) was an [[Armenia]]n-[[United States|American]] [[businessperson|businessman]] and [[home builder]], who founded [[Hovnanian Enterprises]] in 1959. He remained the president and [[chief executive officer]] of Hovnanian Enterprises until his retirement in 1997.&lt;ref name=app&gt;{{cite news|first=David P. |last=Willis |title=Homebuilder leaves legacy of philanthropy |url=http://www.app.com/article/20090925/BUSINESS/909250363/1003 |work=[[Asbury Park Press]] |publisher= |date=2009-09-24 |accessdate=2009-10-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130117065036/http://www.app.com/article/20090925/BUSINESS/909250363/1003 |archivedate=2013-01-17 |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt; Despite some recent financial difficulties due to the 2008-2009 recession and financial crisis, Hovnanian Enterprises remains the sixth largest American homebuilder and the largest homebuilder in [[New Jersey]], as of September 2009.&lt;ref name=app/&gt;

==Biography==
Kevork Hovnanian was born in [[Kirkuk]], present-day [[Iraq]], in 1923. He was the oldest of four sons born to Stepan K. Hovnanian, a refugee from [[Armenia]] who had settled in [[Iraq]].&lt;ref name=app/&gt; Stepan Hovnanian operated a [[construction]] business in Kirkuk which held contracts with [[oil companies]] in the region.&lt;ref name=app/&gt;

===Career===
Hovnanian took over the family's construction business after his father became ill.  The company eventually employed more than 12,000 people in Iraq.&lt;ref name=app/&gt; However, Hovnanian fled to the [[United States]] in the aftermath of the 1958 [[14 July Revolution|Iraqi Revolution]], which overthrew the [[monarchy]] of [[Faisal II of Iraq]].&lt;ref name=app/&gt; Most of his family also moved to the United States.

In 1959, Kevork and his three brothers - [[Hirair Hovnanian]], [[Jirair Hovnanian]] and [[Vahak Hovnanian]] - each contributed $1,000 dollars, in addition to $20,000 which they borrowed from Peter S. Vosbikian (d.1971), to found [[Hovnanian Enterprises, Inc.]] in a trailer in [[Toms River, New Jersey]].&lt;ref name=app/&gt;&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;{{cite news|first=Barry |last=Meier |title=Kevork S. Hovnanian, Construction Company Founder, Dies at 86 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/26/business/26hovnanian.html |work=[[New York Times]]|publisher=|date=2009-09-25 |accessdate=2009-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hirair, Jirair and Vahak left the company by 1969 to found their own enterprises.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt; Hovnanian and his company earned a reputation to selling low cost [[condos]] and [[townhouse]]s, many to first time young homewowners and families.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt; A typical two-[[bedroom]], two [[bathroom]] Hovnanian home built in the early 1980s cost approximately $30,000 because Hovnanian eliminated [[amenities]] such as communal [[swimming pool]]s, which other builders used to attract potential buyers.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt; In a New York Times interview in 1983, Hovnanian explained his reasoning for marketing low cost homes in developments without community amenities, "There are limited [[recreation]] facilities going in because people have little time for [[socialization]]."&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt;

Hovnanian Enterprises had built and sold more than 30,000 homes and condos by 1989.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt; An additional 200,000 residences were sold between 1989 and 2009, as the company expanded its construction to include [[Luxury real estate|luxury]] homes, mid-priced homes and [[retirement communities]].&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt; It remains one the United States' largest builders of "active adult homes", which are sold under the name of Four Seasons communities.&lt;ref name=app/&gt;

Kevork Hovnanian stepped down as president of Hovnanian Enterprises in 1989, and was succeeded by his son, [[Ara K. Hovnanian]].&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt; He remained [[chief executive]] until his retirement in 1997, and was also replaced as CEO by Ara Hovnanian.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt; However, he remained the chairman of the company's [[board of directors]] until his death in 2009.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt;

The company relocated its [[corporate headquarters]] to a new building on the banks of the [[Navesink River]] in [[Red Bank, New Jersey]], in 2006.&lt;ref name=app/&gt;

===Philanthropy===
[[File:St. Stepanos Armenian Church - Elberon, NJ.jpg|thumb|right|210px|Hovnanian helped to construct St. Stepanos Armenian Church in the [[Elberon, New Jersey]] in memory of his mother.]]
Hovnanian left a number of philanthropic contributions during his life, especially in support of [[New Jersey]], [[Armenia]] and the [[Armenian diaspora]]. Much the focus of his philanthropy focused on medical facilities and hospitals. His contributions included the  K. Hovnanian Pavilion at the Alton A. Hovnanian Emergency Care Center at [[Riverview Medical Center]] in Red Bank and the K. Hovnanian Children's Hospital at [[Jersey Shore University Medical Center]] in [[Neptune Township, New Jersey|Neptune, New Jersey]].&lt;ref name=app/&gt; He also contributed donations to [[New York Presbyterian Hospital]] in [[New York City]], which honored its [[benefactor (law)|benefactor]] by naming its [[cardiology]] practice unit for the K. Hovnanian family.&lt;ref name=app/&gt;

Hovnanian donated a [[townhouse]] in New York City for use as the official Armenian Mission to the [[United Nations]].&lt;ref name=app/&gt; Hovnanian also constructed homes for [[earthquake]] victims in Armenia.&lt;ref name=app/&gt;

In 1986, Hovnanian constructed the St. Stepanos Armenian Church in the [[Elberon, New Jersey|Elberon]] section of [[Long Branch, New Jersey|Long Branch]] in honor of his mother.&lt;ref name=app/&gt;&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt; The construction of the church fulfuilled a promise he had made to himself when he fled Iraq in the late-1950s.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt;

===Later life===
Hovnanian resided in [[Rumson, New Jersey]].&lt;ref name=app/&gt;

Kevork Hovnanian died on September 24, 2009, at [[New York Presbyterian Hospital]] in [[New York City]] at the age of 86.&lt;ref name=app/&gt;&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt; His [[funeral|memorial service]] was held at [[St. Vartan Cathedral]] in [[Manhattan]] on October 3, 2009.&lt;ref name=app/&gt; The service was presided over by Archbishop [[Khajag Barsamian]].&lt;ref name=ar&gt;{{cite news|first=|last=|title=Memorial service held for Kevork Hovnanian at St. Vartan Cathedral|url=http://www.reporter.am/go/article/2009-10-06-memorial-service-held-for-kevork-hovnanian-at-st--vartan-cathedral|work=[[Armenian Reporter]]|publisher=|date=2009-10-06|accessdate=2009-10-19|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091010094110/http://www.reporter.am/go/article/2009-10-06-memorial-service-held-for-kevork-hovnanian-at-st--vartan-cathedral|archivedate=2009-10-10|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2009, [[United Airlines]] expressed interest in using the CS100 and CS300 for replacing its aging 737–300 and 737-500 aircraft,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://blog.seattlepi.com/aerospace/2009/12/10/united-to-consider-bombardier-cseries/ |title= United to consider Bombardier CSeries |work= Boeing and aerospace news |publisher= Seattle PI |date= 10 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; however a future order is unlikely as airline has made orders for the [[Airbus A319]]-100 and the [[Boeing 737]]-800.

In March 2010, [[easyJet]] stated that the company was having "ongoing discussions with Bombardier regarding its CSeries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/news/2010-03-19/airbus-weighs-costs-rivals-advances-in-engine-upgrade-choice.html |title=Airbus Weighs Costs, Rivals’ Advances in Engine Upgrade Choice |work=Businessweek |date=March 19, 2010 |publisher=Bloomberg |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100326182513/http://www.businessweek.com/news/2010-03-19/airbus-weighs-costs-rivals-advances-in-engine-upgrade-choice.html |archivedate=26 March 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; But the airline has since ordered the Airbus A320-200 and A320neo.

In March 2018, it was stated that Garuda Indonesia wanted to order the CS300 as a replacement for the Bombardier CRJ-1000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aviatren.com/2018/03/10/garuda-indonesia-ganti-atr72-dan-crj1000-dengan-bombardier-cs300/|title=Garuda Indonesia Ganti ATR72 dan CRJ1000 dengan Bombardier CS300?trans-title=Garuda Indonesia to replace ATR72 and CRJ1000 with Bombardier CS300?|date=March 10, 2018|access-date=8 May 2018|language=Indonesian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Little Tokyo''', also known as '''Little Tokyo Historic District''',  is an ethnically [[Japanese American]] [[district]] in [[downtown Los Angeles]] and the heart of the largest Japanese-American population in North America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/07/travel/travel-advisory-correspondent-s-report-la-s-little-tokyo-perseveres.html | work=The New York Times | first=Todd S. | last=Purdum | title=TRAVEL ADVISORY: CORRESPONDENT'S REPORT; L.A.'s Little Tokyo Perseveres | date=February 7, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the largest and most populous of only three official [[Japantown]]s in the United States, all of which are in [[California]] (the other two are [[Japantown, San Francisco]] and [[Japantown, San Jose, California|Japantown, San Jose]]).  Founded around the beginning of the 20th century, the area, sometimes called '''Lil' Tokyo''', '''J-Town''', '''小東京''' ('''Shō-tōkyō'''), is the cultural center for [[Japanese Americans]] in [[Southern California]]. It was declared a [[National Historic Landmark District]] in 1995.&lt;ref name="nhlsum"/&gt;

==History==

In 1905 the area of "Little Tokyo" was described as "bounded by [[San Pedro Street|San Pedro]], [[1st Street, Los Angeles|First]] and Requena streets and [[Central Avenue, Los Angeles|Central avenue]]. The ''Los Angeles Times'' added: "It has a population of about 3500 Japanese, with quite a colony of Jews and Russians and a few Americans. . . . there are 10,000 Japanese in the city who make this section their rendezvous."&lt;ref name=JapsShake&gt;[http://search.proquest.com/hnplatimes/docview/159321758/19A753BC14AF495EPQ/7?accountid=6749# "Japs Shake in Their Shoes," ''Los Angeles Times,'' June 15, 1909, page II-1]&lt;/ref&gt;

The area was a magnet for immigrating Japanese until the [[Exclusion Act of 1924]] halted any further migration. Shops were along First Street, and vegetable markets were along Central Avenue to the south. Japanese Americans were a significant ethnic group in the vegetable trade, due to the number of successful Japanese American truck farms across Southern California. In 1941, there were approximately 30,000 Japanese Americans living in Little Tokyo.&lt;ref name=Nakagawa&gt;Nakagawa, Martha. [http://encyclopedia.densho.org/Little%20Tokyo%20/%20Bronzeville,%20Los%20Angeles,%20California/ "Little Tokyo / Bronzeville, Los Angeles,"] ''Densho Encyclopedia''. Retrieved July 15, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Japanese American internment|incarceration of Japanese Americans]] during [[World War II]] emptied Little Tokyo. For a brief time, the area became known as ''[[Bronzeville (Los Angeles)|Bronzeville]]'' as [[African American]]s and also [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] and [[Latinos]] moved into the vacated properties and opened up nightclubs, restaurants, and other businesses. Beginning in 1942, after the city's Japanese population was rounded up and "evacuated" to [[Internment of Japanese Americans|inland concentration camps]], a large number of African Americans moved to Los Angeles to find work in the labor-starved defense industry. Its share in the [[Second Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]] almost tripled Little Tokyo's pre-war population, with some 80,000 new arrivals taking up residence there. Prohibited from buying and renting in most parts of the city by [[Covenant (law)#Exclusionary covenants|restrictive covenants]], the area soon became severely overcrowded. A single bathroom was often shared by up to 40 people and one room could house as many as 16; people frequently shared "hot beds," sleeping in shifts. Poor housing conditions helped spread communicable illnesses like tuberculosis and venereal disease. Crimes like robberies, rapes, and hit-and-run accidents increased, and in May and June 1943 Latino and some African American residents of Bronzeville were attacked by whites in the [[Zoot Suit Riots|Zoot Suit race riots]]. In 1943, officials bowed to pressure from frustrated residents and proposed building temporary housing in nearby [[Willowbrook, California|Willowbrook]], but the majority-white residents of the unincorporated city resisted the plans. In 1944, 57 Bronzeville buildings were condemned as unfit for habitation and 125 ordered repaired or renovated; approximately 50 of the evicted families were sent to the [[Jordan Downs]] housing complex. In 1945, many defense industry jobs disappeared and the workers moved elsewhere in search of new employment. Others were pushed out when Japanese Americans began to return and white landlords chose not to renew leases with their wartime tenants.&lt;ref name=Nakagawa/&gt;

After the war, due to lack of housing in Little Tokyo, many Japanese Americans returning from the camps moved into neighborhoods surrounding the downtown area, into apartments and boarding houses. Notably, [[Boyle Heights, Los Angeles, California|Boyle Heights]], just east of Little Tokyo, had a large Japanese American population in the 1950s (as it had before the [[internment]]) until the arrival of [[Mexican people|Mexican]] and [[Latino (demonym)|Latino]] immigrants replaced most of them.

In the late 1970s, a redevelopment movement started as Japanese corporations expanded overseas operations and many of them set up their US headquarters in the [[Greater Los Angeles area|Los Angeles area]]. Several new shopping plazas and hotels opened, along with branches of some major Japanese banks. Although this redevelopment resulted in many new buildings and shopping centers, there are still some of the original Little Tokyo buildings and restaurants, especially along First Street.

During the 1970s and 1980s, artists began to move into nearby aging warehouse spaces in the area, forming a hidden community in the industrialized area. Al's Bar, Gorky's, the Atomic Cafe, and [[LA Contemporary Exhibitions]] (LACE) are some well-known sites.&lt;ref name=Zahniser&gt;Zahniser, David (March 15, 2014) [http://articles.latimes.com/2014/mar/15/local/la-me-0316-little-tokyo-history-20140316 "Buildings slated for tear-down were rich part of Little Tokyo history"] ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Land use]] has been a contentious issue in Little Tokyo due to its history, the proximity to the Los Angeles Civic Center, the role of Los Angeles as a site of business between Japan and America, and the increasing influx of residents into the [[Arts District, Los Angeles|Arts District]]. Unlike a [[ethnic enclave|traditional ethnic enclave]], there are relatively few Japanese residents in the area because of evacuation and [[internment]]. Consequently, Little Tokyo, like other ethnic urban enclaves, is constantly threatened with development that could eradicate it. Conversely, because the Japanese American community was politicized by the [[internment]] and subsequent Redress and Reparations effort, and because of the global and local growth of overseas Japanese investment, Little Tokyo has resisted eradication and has continued to exist as a tourist attraction, community center, and home to Japanese American senior citizens and others.

The current site of [[Parker Center]], the [[Los Angeles Police Department]]'s former headquarters, was the original site of the Nishi Hongwanji Buddhist temple. The south edge of the block  where Parker Center stands was part of the First Street business strip of shops. The warehouses and new condominiums to the east of Little Tokyo were once residential areas of the district. The Weller Court mall was opposed by some people in the community because it redeveloped a strip of family-owned small businesses. Community activists established First Street as a historic district in 1986. In 2004, they helped reopen the Far East Cafe, an acknowledged community hub.

In 1959, Los Angeles entered a sister city relationship with the city of [[Nagoya]]. Nagoya is Los Angeles' oldest sister city, along with [[Eilat, Israel]].

==Description==
[[File:Japanese American National Museum.jpg|thumb|left|[[Japanese American National Museum]]]]

At its peak, Little Tokyo had approximately 30,000 Japanese Americans living in the area. Little Tokyo is still a cultural focal point for Los Angeles's Japanese American population. It is mainly a work, cultural, religious, restaurant and shopping district, because Japanese Americans today are likely to live in nearby cities such as [[Torrance, California|Torrance]], [[Gardena, California|Gardena]], and [[Monterey Park, California|Monterey Park]], as well as the [[Sawtelle, Los Angeles|Sawtelle]] district in the [[Westside (Los Angeles County)|Westside]] of Los Angeles. However, the recent boom in downtown residential construction is changing the nature of Little Tokyo.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://planning.lacity.org/complan/othrplan/pdf/Little%20Tokyo/LittleTokyo_CDO/DraftProposedLittleTokyoCDO_DesignGuidelines.pdf LITTLE TOKYO COMMUNITY DESIGN OVERLAY (CDO) DISTRICT"] (December 31, 2013) ''Los Angeles Department of City Planning''&lt;/ref&gt;

What is left of the original Little Tokyo can be found in roughly five large city blocks. It is bounded on the west by Los Angeles Street, on the east by Alameda Street, on the south by [[3rd Street (Los Angeles)|3rd Street]], and on the north by First Street, but also includes a substantial portion of the block north of First and west of Alameda, location of the [[Japanese American National Museum]], the [[Go For Broke Monument]], and a row of historic shops which lines the north side of First Street.  A timeline has been set into the concrete in front of these shops, using bronze lettering, showing the history of each of the shops from the early 20th Century until the renovation of the district in the late 1980s. More broadly, Little Tokyo is bordered by the [[Los Angeles River]] to the east, downtown Los Angeles to the west, [[Los Angeles City Hall|L.A. City Hall]] and the [[Parker Center]] to the north, and the newly named Arts District (made up of warehouses converted into live-work lofts) to the south.{{citation needed|date=September 2011}}

Across from the building is the [[Japanese American National Museum]] opened in 1992—50 years after [[President of the United States|President]] [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] ordered the [[Japanese American internment|forcible removal and incarceration of people of Japanese descent]].]]
The Japanese American Cultural &amp; Community Center is located in Little Tokyo, as well as the [[Japanese American National Museum]]. The extension of the [[Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles|Museum of Contemporary Art]], formerly called the Temporary Contemporary and now known as the [[Geffen Contemporary]] (named after [[David Geffen]]), is also in Little Tokyo. [[East West Players]], one of the nation's first [[Asian American]] theater companies, specializing in live theater written and performed by Asian American artists, is located in Little Tokyo, performing in the [[David Henry Hwang]] Theater. There is also the Aratani/Japan America Theater, which features plays and musical performances. [[Visual Communications (VC)|Visual Communications]], an [[Asian Pacific American]] media arts organization, has its offices in Little Tokyo, and each May, annually presents [[VC FilmFest]] (Los Angeles Asian Pacific Film Festival), in several venues around Little Tokyo. Additionally, the visual arts are represented by the 30-year-old arts non-profit, [http://www.laartcore.org LAArtcore] which devotes itself to creating awareness of the visual arts through 24 exhibitions each year along with educational programming.

The [[Nisei Week]] festival is held every August, and includes a large parade, a pageant, athletic events, exhibits of Japanese art and culture, a [[taiko]] drum festival, the Japanese Festival Street Faire, a car show, and other events. A queen and court will be selected.

Little Tokyo has quite a few public sculptures and artwork, including a monument to Astronaut [[Ellison S. Onizuka]], a Japanese American from [[Hawaii|Hawai{{okina}}i]] who was a mission specialist on the [[Space Shuttle Challenger]] when it disintegrated during [[STS-51-L|takeoff]] in 1986 and another monument to [[Chiune Sugihara]], [[Japan]]ese consul to [[Lithuania]] before [[World War II]] and [[Righteous among the Nations]].&lt;ref name = "APN121602"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Sugihara+statue+dedicated+in+L.A.'s+Little+Tokyo.-a095463043 | title =  Sugihara statue dedicated in L.A.'s Little Tokyo | publisher = Kyodo News International | date = December 13, 2002 |  accessdate = June 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "ArtinLA"&gt;{{cite web | last = Velazco | first = Ramon G. | title = Chiune Sugihara Memorial, Hero of the Holocaust | url = http://www.publicartinla.com/Downtown/Little_Tokyo/sugihara.html  | year = 2002 | accessdate =  June 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also two [[Japanese garden]]s in the area open to the public—one is next to the Japanese American Cultural and Community Center and the other is a rooftop garden in the [[Kyoto Grand Hotel &amp; Gardens|Kyoto Grand Hotel and Gardens]], formerly the [[New Otani Hotel and Garden|New Otani Hotel]]. The [[Go For Broke Monument]] commemorates Japanese Americans who served in the [[United States Military]] during [[World War II]].

===Shopping and dining===
[[File:Little Tokyo Watchtower.jpg|thumb|left|The Little Tokyo Watchtower]]
There are numerous Japanese restaurants, catering to both Japanese and non-Japanese clientele. Many of them specialize in one type of [[Japanese cuisine]], such as [[donburi]], Japanese [[noodles]] ([[soba]], [[ramen]] and [[udon]]), [[shabu-shabu]] (which translated from Japanese means 'swish-swish', referring to the motion of dipping meat and vegetables in a communal bowl of boiling water), Japanese curry, sushi, or yakitori. There are also a number of [[yakiniku]] restaurants, where meat is often cooked on a small grill built into the center of the table.  Little Tokyo is the birthplace of the [[California roll]], invented by a chef named Ichiro Mashita at the Tokyo Kaikan sushi restaurant.

Two ''[[wagashi]]'' (Japanese sweets) shops located in Little Tokyo are among the oldest food establishments in Los Angeles.  Fugetsu-do, founded in 1903,&lt;ref name ="Fugetsu-do"&gt;{{cite web | last = Kikuchi | first = Nancy | title = A History of Fugetsu-Do | url = http://www.fugetsu-do.com/history.htm | accessdate = June 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; appears to be the oldest still-operating food establishment in the city and the first one to celebrate a centennial; its best-known offerings include [[mochi]] and [[manjū]], and it claims to be an inventor of the [[fortune cookie]].  [[Mikawaya]] was founded in 1910, but is now well known as the company that introduced [[mochi ice cream]] to the United States in 1994.&lt;ref name= "aboutmikawaya"&gt;{{cite web |title=Mikawaya History |url=http://www.mochiicecream.com/mikawaya-history/ |accessdate=April 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Little Tokyo has several shops that specialize in Japanese-language [[Videotape|videos]] and [[DVD]]s, while other shops specialize in Japanese [[Consumer electronics|electronics]] and [[video game]]s. These are a great way to find Japanese video games that were either never translated into English, or were never domestically released in North America. There are also several stores that sell manga and anime related products.

The Weller Court shopping mall has several restaurants, karaoke clubs, and a [[Bubble Tea]] cafe. For tourists visiting from Japan, there are a number of shops specializing in expensive [[brand|name brand]] products such as [[Coach (corporation)|Coach]] handbags. There is also a large bookstore, [[Kinokuniya]], that is part of a well-known Japanese chain. They have a large selection of Japanese-language books, magazines, music CDs, [[manga]], and [[anime]], as well as a selection of English-language books on Japanese subjects and translated manga and anime.

[[File:20140622-0132 Little Tokyo LA.JPG|right|thumb|200px|[[Nijiya Market]] in Little Tokyo's Japanese Village Plaza]]
The Japanese Village Plaza is located roughly in the center of Little Tokyo. There are several restaurants in the plaza, plus a number of shops geared towards tourists.  First Street and Second Street border Japanese Village Plaza and have a number of restaurants that are open later than those in the court.

[[File:Koyasan Buddhist Temple Little Tokyo Los Angeles.jpg|thumb|210px|Koyasan Buddhist temple in Little Tokyo]]
There are several [[Buddhist]] temples in the area, mostly [[Jodo Shinshu]], [[Jodo Shu]], [[Shingon]], and [[Soto Zen]] temples, including [[Zenshuji]] Soto Mission (the first [[Soto Zen]] temple in North America), Nishi Honganji (Los Angeles Betsuin), Higashi Honganji, [[Koyasan Buddhist Temple]] (the first Shingon temple in North America), and a few Japanese [[Christian]] churches.

One of the roots of [[Pentecostalism]] started in Little Tokyo. Where the Japanese American Cultural and Community Center Plaza is now located was once the home of the First Pentecostal Church, a multiracial congregation called the Azusa Street Mission. This is where the [[Azusa Street Revival]] started in 1906. Earlier, it was also the site of the First [[African Methodist Episcopal Church|AME]] Church.

St. Francis Xavier Chapel is the center of the Japanese Catholic community in Little Tokyo. Father Albert Breton, a Japanese-speaking missionary of the Paris Foreign Mission Society (M.E.P.) with the support of Bishop Thomas Conaty of the [[Archdiocese of Los Angeles|Diocese of Los Angeles]], established the community on December 25, 1912 with the first Japanese mass celebrated at the Bronson House on Jackson Street near the current Fukui Mortuary on Temple Street. The center formerly housed the Maryknoll School administered by the Maryknoll Fathers from the early 1920s until the mid-1990s. Currently, masses are offered in Japanese and English each Sunday.

The former [[Roman Catholic|Catholic]] [[Cathedral of Saint Vibiana]] is just to the west of Little Tokyo. After being heavily damaged in the 1994 [[Northridge earthquake]], the Archdiocese moved to a new site (now the [[Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels]]) and the old site was redeveloped with the former cathedral converted into a performing arts space and non-historic buildings on the site demolished and replaced with a new Little Tokyo Branch of the [[Los Angeles Public Library]].

==Transportation==
{{refimprove section | date = March 2015}}
The community is served by the [[Metro Gold Line (LACMTA)|Metro Gold Line]] at [[Little Tokyo/Arts District (LACMTA station)|Little Tokyo/Arts District]] station at the northeastern perimeter of Little Tokyo and is also walkable from the [[Metro Red Line (LACMTA)|Metro Red]] and [[Metro Purple Line (LACMTA)|Purple]] subway lines at either [[Civic Center (LACMTA station)|Civic Center]] station or [[Union Station (Los Angeles)|Union Station]] – with connections to [[Amtrak]], [[Metrolink (Southern California)|Metrolink]], [[Metro Silver Line (LACMTA)|Metro Silver Line]] BRT, and [[Foothill Transit|Foothill Transit's]] [[Silver Streak (bus)|Silver Streak]] BRT services. When the [[Blue Line (Los Angeles Metro)|Blue]] and [[Expo Line (Los Angeles Metro)|Expo Lines]] connect to the Gold Line, via the [[Regional Connector (Los Angeles Metro)|Regional Connector]], the Little Tokyo/Arts District station will be moved underground and across the street. This required demolition of two modest, one-story brick buildings. The two structures played an important role in the cultural life of the neighborhood for decades with one of the structures dating back at least to 1898.&lt;ref name=Zahniser/&gt;
[[Metro Local]] lines 30 and 330 serve Little Tokyo.

'''Mohsen Rafighdoost''' (also '''Rafiqdoost''', {{lang-fa|محسن رفیقدوست}}) is an Iranian [[Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps|Revolutionary Guards]] military officer and politician. He is a member of the [[Islamic Coalition Party]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title =JAMʿIYAT-E MOʾTALEFA-YE ESLĀMI i. Hayʾathā-ye Moʾtalefa-ye Eslāmi 1963-79|encyclopedia=[[Encyclopædia Iranica]]|date=February 20, 2013|orig-year=December 15, 2008|publisher=Bibliotheca Persica Press|location=New York City|url =http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/jamiyat-e-motalefa-i|volume= XIV|last1= Rahnema|first1=Ali|access-date=March 15, 2016|series=Fasc. 5|pages=483–500|chapter-url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/jamiyat-e-motalefa-ii|chapter=ii. Jamʿiyat-e Moʾtalefa and the Islamic Revolution}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Rafighdoost's background is that of a ''[[bazaari]]'', the traditional class of people who work in the [[bazaar]].&lt;ref name="Kaplan, 1996 p.201"&gt;Kaplan,  ''The Ends of the Earth, (1996), p.201&lt;/ref&gt; His father was a vegetable and fruit merchant at the Tehran bazaar.&lt;ref name="Klebnikov"&gt;[https://www.forbes.com/forbes/2003/0721/056_3.html Millionaire mullahs] by Paul Klebnikov. ''Forbes'', July 7, 2003, accessed 15-May-2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Military career==
Mohsen Rafighdoost was the chief of [[Ruhollah Khomeini]]'s security detail in 1979 during the [[Iranian Revolution]], and helped found the [[Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps|Revolutionary Guards]] who helped [[Consolidation of the Iranian Revolution#Suppression of opposition|eliminate opposition]] to theocratic rule in the [[Islamic Republic]].

He is noted for having driven Ayatollah [[Ruhollah Khomeini]], the leader of the Revolution, from the [[Tehran]] international airport into Tehran, during Khomeini's triumphant return to Iran from exile, while millions of Iranians crowded the road to welcome Khomeini back. He has told journalists this was the most important day of his life and "crowds were all over the car, touching and hanging on to it."&lt;ref&gt;Kaplan, ''The Ends of the Earth'', (1996), p.200&lt;/ref&gt;

He served from 1982 to 1989 as Minister of the Revolutionary Guards&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iricrimes.org/wanted.asp Islamic Republic of Iran Crimes] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061026212758/http://www.iricrimes.org/wanted.asp |date=2006-10-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; where he quashed internal dissent and obtained weapons from abroad for the [[Iran–Iraq War]].

Rafighdoost said in a 2014 interview that he twice suggested to Khomeini that Iran develop [[weapons of mass destruction]] to counter their [[Iraqi chemical weapons program#Use in the Iran–Iraq War, 1983–1988|use by Saddam Hussein]]. Rafighdoost claimed that both times Khomeini rejected the idea, reasoning that it would be against Islam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Porter|first1=Gareth|title=When the Ayatollah Said No to Nukes|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/articles/2014/10/16/when_the_ayatollah_said_no_to_nukes_iran_khomeini|work=Foreign Policy|date=17 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Business career==
With the election of [[Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani]] he was appointed head of the Mostazafan Foundation or ''[[Bonyad-e Mostazafen va Janbazan]]'' (Foundation of the Oppressed), "the second-largest commercial enterprise" in Iran behind the state-owned [[National Iranian Oil Company]]&lt;ref name="Klebnikov"/&gt; where he remained until 1999.

Since 1999, Mohsen Rafighdoost has been the Director of the Noor Foundation. The Foundation reportedly owns apartment blocks and "makes an estimated $200 million importing pharmaceuticals, sugar and construction materials."&lt;ref&gt;http://rand.org/pubs/monographs/2008/RAND_MG821.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
In 1995, Mohsen Rafighdoost's brother, Morteza Rafighdoost, was sentenced to ten years imprisonment for a bank fraud.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iran-press-service.com/articles/bonyad_2379923.html THE CHANGE AT THE DEPRIVED FOUNDATION A CONCESSION TO KHATAMI?]&lt;/ref&gt; After this, Supreme Leader [[Ali Khamenei]] appointed a board of trustees and made the Bonyad-e Mostazafen va Janbazan subject to [[Majlis|parliamentary]] scrutiny.&lt;ref&gt;[http://iranpoliticsclub.net/library/english-library/lori%27s-song1/index.htm#On%20Mohammad%20Forouzandeh On Mohammad Forouzandeh]&lt;/ref&gt;

Rafighdoost's personal fortune is said to be worth the equivalent of many millions of dollars.&lt;ref name="Kaplan, 1996 p.201" /&gt; When asked about his personal wealth, Rafighdoost has responded: "I am just a normal person, with normal wealth, but if Islam is threatened, I will become big again."&lt;ref name="Klebnikov" /&gt;

'''Pendulum arbitration''', otherwise known as final offer arbitration (or "FOA"), is a type of [[interest arbitration]] in which the [[arbitrator]] chooses one of the parties' proposals on each (or perhaps all) disputed issues. For example, in the case of [[labor union|labor]] [[collective bargaining]], a trade union may demand a wage increase of 7% and the management may offer 3%. The arbitrator's decision has to choose between awarding a 3% or a 7% increase. This procedure is opposed to conventional interest arbitration, in which the parties present evidence and the arbitrator acts as fact-finder and crafts an award. In disputes over labor contracts, this [[dispute resolution]] procedure is known to be a common type of [[contract arbitration]]. Perhaps the most well-known instance is [[Major_League_Baseball_transactions#Free_agency_and_salary_arbitration|salary arbitration]] in [[Major League Baseball]], where a certain class of players may elect to arbitrate their salary instead of accepting their team's salary offer. Final-offer arbitration is widely used to determine public union contracts in the United States, either as a substitute for collective bargaining or as a mechanism to determine the contract when bargaining has failed. 

A primary purpose and effect of FOA is to encourage the parties to arrive at a settlement by introducing uncertainty into the arbitration procedure.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dir.ca.gov/chswc/BasebalArbFfinal.htm California Department of Labor Relations, Commission on Health and Safety and Workers' Compensation: literature review – Final Offer Arbitration]&lt;/ref&gt; Parties who fail to compromise during negotiations risk a total loss on some or all arbitrated issues under FOA. This uncertainty is considered a "cost" of arbitration that the parties can avoid by settling. By contrast, in conventional arbitration, parties are more likely to call on the arbitrator to decide disputed issues, giving the arbitrator the power to craft a "reasonable" award. In addition to promoting settlement, use of FOA leads parties to adopt reasonable positions during the arbitration, because an unreasonable position will almost certainly be rejected in favor of a more reasonable competing proposal. 

== Pendulum arbitration outside the U.S. ==

Chile's Secretary of Labor and Social Security [[José Piñera]] pioneered the introduction in a national law utilizing this mechanism. In fact, Chile's 1979 Labor Reform mandates pendulum arbitration for special collective bargaining cases. The Chilean law also required the parties to pay the full cost of the arbitrator, another incentive to try to avoid the arbitration and reach bilateral agreements. The law created a register of private arbitrators (economists and lawyers with a solid reputation for expertise and fairness), some or all of whom the parties shall agree to select, to decide conclusively the terms of the contract. There is consensus among experts that this system in Chile has proved very successful, and it has not been disturbed by subsequent governments.{{fact|date=August 2016}}

'''Playbour''' (sometimes spelled '''playbor''') is a term used to describe a hybrid form of play and labour, specifically in the digital games industry. The term was coined by Julian Kücklich in 2005 in his article ''Precarious playbour: Modders and the digital games industry.'' Kücklich describes playbour as a type of free labour that fits neither traditional definitions of work nor the categories of play or leisure.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://journal.fibreculture.org/issue5/kucklich_print.html|title=Precarious Playbour: Modders and the Digital Games Industry|last=Kücklich|first=Julian|date=|website=journal.fibreculture.org|access-date=2018-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, forms of playbour are often incorrectly perceived as being just an extension of play. Playbour is also sometimes categorized as a part of the [[gamification]] of society in general.

== History ==
While the term playbour itself is a relatively new invention, the phenomena it concerns – those of productive leisure and free labour in the digital games industry – have been around at least since the late 1990s. Kücklich states that since the early 1990s, the relationship between the players of digital games and the digital games industry has changed substantially. He attributes the alteration to the rise of computer [[game modification]], or "modding", as a widespread practice among players.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Modding ===
Creating [[Mod (video gaming)|mods]] for digital games is the perfect example of playbour: a growing number of consumers of digital games are not satisfied with just playing the game, but prefer to enhance their playing experience by creating content for the game themselves. In modding we can see the very essence of playbour, or free labour: while the work of creating a modification can be seen as playful and enjoyable, it is still work. In this respect modding can be fairly similar to another form of collaborative digital production; [[Open-source software|open-source]] software development. The first game to gain a modder base of considerable size is widely agreed to be [[Doom (1993 video game)|Doom]] (1993).&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sotamaa|first=Olli|date=3 September 2007|title=On modder labour, commodification of play, and mod competitions|url=http://journals.uic.edu/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/2006|journal=First Monday|language=en-US|volume=12|issue=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The emergence of Doom mods is usually attributed to the fact that the game's code was deliberately designed to facilitate player-created content.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The most famous modder creation is probably [[Counter-Strike]], originally a team-based mod for [[Half-Life (video game)|Half-Life]] (1998). It later also became the first commercially released mod.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Controversy around playbour and modding ==
Not only is modding a big part of [[Video game culture|gaming culture]], but it is also an increasingly important source of value for the digital games industry. Game companies usually retain the [[Intellectual property|intellectual property rights]] of the modifications. Since players need to have a copy of the original game to run the modifications, mods may add to the shelf-life of the product.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In addition to that, mods may help with establishing [[brand]]s (e.g. Counter-Strike), thus saving companies a significant amount of money. Marketing costs often take up a large percentage of a game's budget, but successfully established brands require less marketing. Mods also increase customer loyalty and are an important source of innovation in the digital games industry.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Another way that game companies can benefit from the modding culture is that they can recruit modders as employees who are already trained at no cost to the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ephemerajournal.org/contribution/playbour-farming-and-labour|title=Playbour, farming and labour|last=Goggin|first=Joyce|date=|website=www.ephemerajournal.org|access-date=2018-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While game companies may benefit economically from playbour, the players doing the work are not entirely uncompensated: they may obtain virtual in-game rewards or social capital such as followers on [[social media]]. The experience of play also has value in itself.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://thesocietypages.org/cyborgology/2012/10/15/gamification-playbor-exploitation-2/|title=Gamification, Playbor &amp; Exploitation|last=Patella-Rey|first=PJ|date=16 October 2012|work=The Society Pages|access-date=2018-02-24|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Playbour is a voluntary activity and players don't usually view modding as labour. Nevertheless, it has been suggested that playboures are exploited by the games industry.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

===Contributions to theology===
[[File:Jensen_in_office_for_Reflections.jpg|thumb|right|Jensen in his office for ''Reflections.'']]
In the late 1960s the [[charismatic movement]] was causing a controversies in the Lutheran church. Jensen had become a leading scholar on the application of a Lutheran theological understanding of [[neo-Pentecostalism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Oh |first1=Sung Choon |title=A Critical Understanding of the Modern Glossolalia Phenomena of Pastoral Perspective |url=ftp://210.102.253.7/image01/ii100039.pdf |publisher=Chicago Theological Seminary |accessdate=August 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jensen wrote his first book in 1974, ''Touched by the Spirit'', developing a Lutheran perspective on his personal experiences, and attempting to embrace the [[charismatic movement]] rather than condemn it.&lt;ref&gt;ftp://210.102.253.7/image01/ii100039.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://brage.bibsys.no/xmlui/bitstream/handle/11250/162031/2012_biniel%20mallyo.pdf?sequence=1&lt;/ref&gt; Jensen's research was met some skepticism, but ultimately received positive reception from parish pastors, theologians, and college professors.{{elucidate|date=July 2014}}

Although, Jensen's Ph.D was in systematic theology, he developed a story-based preaching technique that emphasized preaching as an oral art of communication rather than written discourse memorized or read to listeners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Boden |first1=Jan |title=The Rev. Dr. Richard A. Jensen Presents "Thinking in Pictures," July 5–6 During ACTS Preaching Residency at LSTC |url=http://www.lstc.edu/communications/news/?a=article&amp;id=142 |website=lstc.edu |publisher=Evangelical Lutheran Church of America |accessdate=August 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1993, Jensen published ''Thinking in Story''. This was followed by three books that understood the Gospels of Matthew, Mark, and Luke as oral narratives from which the preacher used bibilical narrative to enable the listener to participate more holistically in the stories of Jesus. Jensen further expanded his understanding of preaching to incorporate the use of art and visual images in the sermon and worship experience. This thinking culminated in the book published in 2005, ''Envisioning the Word: The Use of Visual Images in Preaching.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Preaching in Post-Literate with Dr. Richard Jensen |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Thinking_in_Story.html?id=Lb3FDnc6tR4C |website=books.google |accessdate=August 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In later years, they were joined by brothers, [[Sulaiman Abdul Aziz Al Rajhi|Sulaiman]], [[Abdullah Abdul Aziz Al Rajhi|Abdullah]] and [[Mohammed Abdul Aziz Al Rajhi|Mohammed]] and diversified their into real estate, trading, construction, manufacturing, etc. although banking and finance remain their primary source of family wealth.

[[File:Detroit Photographic Company (0724).jpg|thumb|right|The Cuyahoga County Soldiers' and Sailors' Monument, circa 1900]]
The '''Cuyahoga County Soldiers' and Sailors' Monument''' is a monument to [[American Civil War|Civil War]] soldiers and sailors from [[Cuyahoga County, Ohio|Cuyahoga County]], [[Ohio]]. Located in the southeast quadrant of [[Public Square, Cleveland|Public Square]] in [[Downtown Cleveland|downtown]] [[Cleveland, Ohio|Cleveland]], it opened July 4, 1894.&lt;ref name="gifts"&gt;{{cite news| title=Gifts to renovate Soldiers and Sailors Monument sit in bank while county awaits repayment| author=Dave Davis| work=[[The Plain Dealer]]| publisher=cleveland.com| date=6 April 2011| url=http://blog.cleveland.com/metro/2011/04/county_waiting_on_renovation_f.html| accessdate=2011-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was designed by architect [[Levi Scofield]] (1842–1917), who also created the monument's [[sculpture]]s. F.F. Schnitzer was the supervising architect who oversaw the creation of the structure. The monument is regularly open to the public free of charge.

==History and Construction==
The monument consists of a 125-foot black Quincy [[granite]] shaft erected on a square base constructed of rough-hewn granite blocks trimmed in sandstone and housing a memorial building. The shaft divided by six carved bands which list the names of battles in which Cuyahoga soldiers fought and is topped with a bronze statue of the "Goddess of Liberty" signifying loyalty to United States.&lt;ref name="Love"&gt;{{cite news| title= Historic emblems restored in the gardens of Cleveland's Soldiers and Sailors Monument| date=2 June 2010| author=Susan Love| work=The Plain Dealer| url=http://www.cleveland.com/insideout/index.ssf/2010/06/post_28.html| publisher=cleveland.com| accessdate=2011-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Designed by Levi Scofield, a Captain in the 103rd Ohio Volunteer Infantry, the monument consists of an elevated base, surmounted by a column capped with a 15' high a statue of Freedom, defended by the shield of Liberty. He also created the monument's magnificent sculptures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gleason|first1=William J.|title=History of Cuyahoga County soldiers' and sailors' monument. Scenes and incidents from its inception to its completion.|date=1894|publisher=The Monument Commission|location=Cleveland|page=615|accessdate=20 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scofield is also known for his design of the [[Ohio State Reformatory]], located in [[Mansfield, Ohio]] and site of the film, [[The Shawshank Redemption]], as well as Cleveland's Schofield Building, known today as [[The Kimpton Schofield Hotel]].

The larger than life bronzes, viewed in the proper sequence, tell of the war’s deadly progression. The south side features the Navy, as sailors load a giant mortar at the low casualties, 48 hour [[Battle of Island Number Ten]]. The bronze features an African American, in one of the first monuments showing blacks and whites fighting side-by-side. Moving counter-clockwise (on purpose. Scofield shows that war is contrary to human nature.) the next bronze is the Artillery. The cannoneers aim and fire, but there are losses – two artillerists have been killed. 

On the north side is Infantry, during a battle at Resaca, GA. where Scofield was present.  Of the nine figures, three are dead. The rest have been wounded. Finally, to the west, the Cavalry statue shows all the horrors of war in ferocious, hand-to-hand combat – in frightening realism. The only rebel soldier is shot at point blank range, in a very accurate sculptural portrayal of war.

The interior provides peace and tranquility. Bronze panels mark the beginning and end of the war, as well as Lincoln’s freeing of the slaves. Another panel shows the names of 100 women of the Northern Ohio Soldiers and Sailors Relief Society. In the corner of the panel sits a Catholic nun, from the Ursuline order, who still run Cleveland’s St. Vincent Charity Medical Center. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Notarianni|first1=Nancy|title=Hidden in Plain Site: The Soldiers and Sailors Monument|journal=Cleveland Visitor|date=July 2011|publisher=City Visitor, Inc.|location=Independence, Ohio}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Inside the memorial building are a series of marble tablets listing 9,000 Civil War veterans that served with Cuyahoga County [[regiment]]s or were from Cuyahoga County.&lt;ref name="wtam"/&gt;  Also inside the base are four bronze relief sculptures depicting the Soldiers' Aid Society, [[Abolitionism|Emancipation of the Slaves]], Beginning of the War in Ohio and the End of the War, as well as busts of Col. James Barnett, Scofield, and several Ohio officers who were killed in action during the war.&lt;ref name="Caniglia"/&gt;

==Restoration==
[[File:Color Guard Grouping.jpg|thumb|right|One of the four sculptural groupings on the monument's exterior]]
Restoration of the monument began October 26, 2008, and was expected to last approximately nine months with a cost [[US$|$]]1.5 million.  Funds came from federal, state and local governments, veterans' and community groups.&lt;ref name="wtam"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.wtam.com/cc-common/mainheadlines3.html?feed=122520&amp;article=4472551 |title=Soldiers' and Sailors' Monument to be restored |publisher=wtam.com |author=Ted Klopp| work=[[WTAM]]-AM 1100| location=Cleveland, Ohio |date=2008-10-26 |accessdate=2009-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Work included cleaning interior and exterior stonework, structural repairs and painting, restoring chandeliers, installing upgraded heating and lighting, repairs to stained glass windows, installing air conditioning and making the monument accessible to disabled visitors.  When the marble tablets were created, names were etched with acid, then inked.  Over time, the dyes from the ink leached into the marble and discolored it.  Workers cleaned each name and restored the marble's original patina.&lt;ref name="Caniglia"&gt;{{cite news |first=John |last=Caniglia |title=Making Soldiers' and Sailors' Monument like new |url=http://blog.cleveland.com/metro/2009/03/making_soldiers_and_sailors_mo.html |work=The Plain Dealer |publisher=cleveland.com |date=20 March 2009 |accessdate=2009-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The renovated monument opened June 5, 2010,&lt;ref name="reopen"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://blog.cleveland.com/metro/2010/06/soldiers_and_sailors_monument.html| title=Cleveland's Soldiers and Sailors Monument reopens| author=Evelyn Theiss| work=The Plain Dealer| date=5 June 2010| publisher=cleveland.com| accessdate=2011-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; with $2 million spent on work.&lt;ref name="gifts"/&gt;

From the time of dedication until the 1940s, plantings around the monument depicted 24 army corps badges and 5 badges of Civil War organizations.  After construction work finished, volunteer gardeners used over 16,000 plants to recreate the 5 organization badges plus two based on illustrations in the memorial room and one for the Daughters of Union Veterans.  The plants cost $6,500 and were specially cultivated for the project.  The 24 army badges could not be recreated because of budget constraints.&lt;ref name="Love"/&gt;

In 2011, researchers discovered that the names of 140 black soldiers from the area were omitted from the tablets.  The commission overseeing the monument said it will add the names and others they discover through additional research.&lt;ref name="newsnet"&gt;{{cite news| title=Black Civil War veterans to be added to Cleveland's Soldiers &amp; Sailors Monument, honored on Memorial Day| publisher=cleveland.com| first=Dale| last=Davis| work=The Plain Dealer| url=http://blog.cleveland.com/metro/2011/05/black_civil_war_vets_to_be_add.html| date=28 May 2011| accessdate=2011-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Oy Moomin Characters, Ltd==
Growing up in the center of the collaboration of efforts between her aunt and father, Jansson gained an intimate window into the creative processes behind the [[Moomin comic strips|''Moomin'' comic strip series]]. As Tove's efforts became directed more at writing and the strip's production became more the effort of her father, Jansson became an active help in management of the visual aspects of ''[[Moomin]]'' as an intellectual property.

In 1979, Lars Jansson founded the [[limited liability company]], Oy Moomin Characters, Ltd, now headed by Christer Timgren.&lt;ref name="turunsanomat" /&gt;  According to a 2004 article in the Finnish business magazine ''Talouselämä'', Oy Moomin Characters, Ltd is [[Finland]]'s most cost-effective business, with some 80 Moomin [[licence]]s in Finland and almost 300 abroad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last = Räihä|first = Soile|title = Tove Jansson, The Moomin Business and Finnish Children|publisher = [[University of Tampere|Finnish Institutions Research Paper, University of Tampere]]|date = 2005-12-18|url = http://www.uta.fi/FAST/FIN/CULT/sr-moom.html|accessdate = 2008-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been listed as among the top [[Creative industries|Creative Export Companies]] of Finland in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.digibusiness.fi/portal/content_business_channel/top_30_finnish_international_companies_in_creative_export/|title = TOP 30 Finnish International Companies in Creative Export|accessdate = 18 September 2008|last = Blomqvist|first = Irina|year = 2007|work = Digibusiness.fi|location = [[Finland]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1993, Jansson, together with her father, has managed the production of a new series of Moomin strips which Jansson now manages solely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Maria |last=Ånger |title=När Mumin Erövrade Världen |url=http://www.nytid.fi/arkiv/artikelnt-684-1577.html |work=[[Ny Tid (Finland)|Ny Tid]] |publisher=Tigertext Ab |location=Finland |date=1 December 2000 |accessdate=2008-09-18 |language=Swedish |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927073203/http://www.nytid.fi/arkiv/artikelnt-684-1577.html |archivedate=September 27, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006 Jansson took the role of director in the release of the [[Compact Disc|CD]], ''Muumipeikko ja Pyrstötähti''.&lt;ref&gt;Poijärvi, Timo.

In 2008, the rediscovery by Jansson of the [[Screenplay|manuscript]] for "The King in Moominland" (a TV script written by Tove and Lars in the late 60s) made news as the resulting [[Musical theatre|musical]] performed at the [[Åbo Svenska Teater]] represented the first performance of this "lost episode" in decades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first = Sirpa|last = Pääkkönen|title = Kansallisteatterissa kotimaisten syksy|url = http://www.hs.fi/kulttuuri/artikkeli/Kansallisteatterissa+kotimaisten+syksy/1135238534011|work = [[Helsingin Sanomat]]|location = [[Helsinki]], [[Finland]]|date = 11 August 2008|accessdate = 2008-09-18|language = Finnish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.svenskateatern.fi/sve/kungenimumindalen |title=Urpremiär 28 augusti 2008: Kungen i Mumindalen |accessdate=18 September 2008 |work=The Swedish Theatre in Helsinki |location=[[Helsinki]], [[Finland]] |language=Swedish |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090202043843/http://svenskateatern.fi/sve/kungenimumindalen |archivedate=2 February 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2003, [[Diplomatic missions of finland#Europe|The Finnish Embassy]] in [[London]] arranged for events to surround the recent translation of Tove Jansson's 1972 ''[[The Summer Book|Sommarboken]]'', a novel which featured the fictionalized life of the young Sophia on an island.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last = Jansson|first = Tove|authorlink = Tove Jansson|title = Sommarboken|publisher = Schildts/Albert Bonniers Förlag|year = 1972|isbn = 951-50-0018-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; During this event, publishers presented works by Sophia Jansson and [[Johanna Sinisalo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=Brittilehdet suosittelevat Tove Janssonin ja Johanna Sinisalon kirjoja |publisher=[[Diplomatic missions of Finland#Asia|Finnish Embassy in Tokyo]] |date=2003-07-16 |language=Finnish |url=http://www.finland.or.jp/article.asp?intNWSAID=16208&amp;LAN=FI&amp; |accessdate=2008-09-18 }}{{dead link|date=May 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Jansson was later interviewed in June 2003 by ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' where she explained the details surrounding the story presented in ''[[The Summer Book|Sommarboken]]'' and the relationship shared between Jansson and her aunt, [[Tove Jansson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first = Maya|last = Jaggi|authorlink=Maya Jaggi|title = Helsinki diary: Runes of song|url = https://www.theguardian.com/books/2005/sep/03/featuresreviews.guardianreview|work = [[The Guardian]]|location =London|date = 3 September 2005|accessdate = 2008-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title = Suomalainen kirjallisuus hyvässä nosteessa Britanniassa|publisher = [[Diplomatic missions of Finland#Europe|Ministry for Foreign Affairs of Finland, London]]|date = 2003-06-04|language = Finnish|url = http://www.finemb.org.uk/public/?contentid=98095&amp;contentlan=1&amp;culture=fi-FI|accessdate = 2008-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; She would write in more detail about this topic in 2006 in the Scandinavian Review,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last = Jansson|first = Sophia|authorlink = Sophia Jansson|year = 2006|title = Tove Jansson and Her Lovable Moomins|journal = Scandinavian Review|url = http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3760/is_200610/ai_n19197999?tag=content;col1|accessdate = 2008-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; and again in 2010 for ''The Guardian'', when she explained the nature of her relationship with the rest of the family including her grandmother [[Signe Hammarsten-Jansson|Signe]] and Tove's partner, [[Tuulikki Pietilä|Tuulikki]].&lt;ref name=guardian3july10/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19939">Traditionally, [[market orientation]] (MO) focuses on [[Microenvironment (business)|microenvironment]] and the functional management of an organisation. However, contemporary organisations have widened their focus to incorporate more roles, functions and emphasis on the macro environment.&lt;ref name=Elliot&gt;Elliot, G.R.(1990)The marketing concept- Necessary but sufficient? An environmental view. European Journal of Marketing., 24 , 20-30.&lt;/ref&gt; Firms have been concerned with short run success and often not taken into account the long-run ecological, social and economic effects from their activities. Despite growth in the MO concept, there is still a need to reconceptualise the concept with a greater emphasis on external factors that influence a firm.&lt;ref name=Mitchell&gt;Mitchell, R.W., Wooliscroft, B., &amp; Higham, J.  (2010) Sustainable Market Orientation: A New Approach to Managing Marketing Strategy. Journal of Macromarketing. 30 (2) 160-170&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sustainable market orientation''' ('''SMO''') combines the principles of MO with a macro marketing systems management approach, a stakeholder approach to integrated corporate social responsibility and marketing strategy, and the use of the sustainability management concept. SMO will serve to move corporate management beyond the micro economic and functional management prescribed by MO and provide a more comprehensive, stakeholder based approach. Mitchell et al.&lt;ref name=Mitchell/&gt; believe an avenue for the reformulation of MO  to create SMO lies in the synthesis of MO, macromarketing, [[corporate social responsibility]] (CSR), and [[sustainable development]] management concepts.

==Background==

Unsustainable practices using traditional ideas have a number of consequences with detrimental effects to the external environment. [[Creative destruction]] implies destruction is essential for sustained [[economic growth]]. Whilst this may be economically beneficial, in many instances it can have overarching negative impacts on the social and ecological [[:wikt:environment|environment]].&lt;ref&gt;Tonts, M. &amp; Greive, S. (2002) Commodification and creative destruction in the Australian rural landscape: the case of Bridgetown, Western Australia. Australian Geographical Studies, 40, 58-70.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Marshall Berman]]'s take on creative destruction identifies that everything is built to be later torn down.&lt;ref&gt;Berman, M. 1983. All that is solid melts into air: The experience of modernity, Verso.&lt;/ref&gt; This capitalistic approach relates to the idea [[tragedy of the commons]]. When firms and individuals only think about their own self-interest as opposed to society as a whole, it will result in [[over exploitation]] of finite resources with long term consequences.&lt;ref&gt;Daniels, B. (2007) Emerging Commons and Tragic Institutions. Envtl. L., 37, 515.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rise of sustainable marketing concepts===

The issues raised in these traditional self-motivated approaches pave the way for a new wave of concepts and theory.

[[Ecological economics]] promotes preserving [[natural capital]] with emphasis on [[sustainability]] and sustainable development.&lt;ref&gt;Soderbaum, P. (2004) Politics and ideology in ecological economics. Online Encyclopaedia of Ecological Economics.&lt;/ref&gt; The potential negative impacts of creative destruction and tragedy of the commons are central to what ecological economics addresses, specifically the earth's [[carrying capacity]].&lt;ref&gt;Harris, J. M. (2002) Environmental &amp; natural resource economics. Recherche, 67, 02.&lt;/ref&gt; Self invested firms without sustainable practices no longer have a place in the modern corporate world.

In terms of marketing, this shift has led to the development of concepts trying to promote and incorporate these ideas see: [[green marketing]], [[triple bottom line]], [[sustainability marketing]], [[sustainability brand]],and CSR. This shift towards adopting sustainable practices is both consumer and company driven.&lt;ref&gt;Mendleson, N &amp; Polonsky, M.J. (1995) Using strategic alliances to develop credible green marketing. Journal of Consumer Marketing, 12, 4-18.&lt;/ref&gt; Governments are also looking for more long run approaches towards the achievement of sustainability.&lt;ref&gt;Dabholkar, U. (1989). Environmental perspective to the year 2000 and beyond: A framework for world development. Environmental Conservation, 16, 49-53.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Brundtland Commission]] or [[Our Common Future]] which was published in 1987 from the [[United Nations]] [[World Commission on Environment and Development]]. It is crucially important to the conceptualisation of SMO and is commonly seen as defining sustainable development. It has been the catalyst for the emergence of work on sustainability. It signaled the surfacing of issues regarding sustaining the environment as critical to international governance.&lt;ref&gt;Sneddon, C., Howarth, R. B. &amp; Norgaard, R. B. (2006) Sustainable development in a post-Brundtland world. Ecological Economics, 57, 253-268.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==

SMO differentiates from other sustainable business strategies by focusing on the institutional [[marketing management]] aspects of the firm and taking a more [[Stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholder]] based approach to corporate management. Through the use of sustainable management principles the firm is able to:
*Achieve objectives such as market competitiveness and [[profit (accounting)|profit]]ability through the application of economically, socially, and environmentally responsible value systems;
*Use [[marketing strategies]] that anticipate and meet customer needs through the effective integration of comprehensive environmental intelligence with operational and marketing systems;&lt;ref name=Mitchell/&gt;
*Generate positive, long-run outcomes in economic, social, and environmental terms that are acceptable for primary stakeholders who derive direct financial benefits from the firms and secondary stakeholders who gain indirect economic, social, and environmental benefits.&lt;ref name=Mitchell/&gt;

===Theoretical foundations===

Theoretical foundations for SMO have come from three prior sustainable marketing models.

"Socio-ecological market orientation" is the first theory that has led to the conceptualisation of SMO.&lt;ref name=Sheth&gt;Sheth, J.N. &amp; Parvatiyar, A. (1995) Ecological imperatives and the role of marketing. Environmental marketing: Strategies, practice, theory, and research, 3-20.&lt;/ref&gt; Social and ecological  problems that arise from a [[free market]] approach could be mitigated by developing a framework  of social, political, economic and ecological norms agreed upon corporations and society that govern the marketing based economy. However, it has a focus on corporate environmental marketing management, as opposed to sustainability and this concept relies on government regulation to ensure compliance.

A second, academically popular, approach  relates to green corporate marketing strategies and lifecycle ecological management of product and service management.&lt;ref&gt;Fuller, D. A. (1999) Sustainable marketing: managerial-ecological issues, Sage Publications Thousand Oaks, CA.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, this approach, whilst recognising the importance of incorporating environmentally responsible management fails to incorporate social, economic and environmental management aspects that are paramount to sustainable development.&lt;ref name=Mitchell/&gt;

A third approach to sustainable marketing is using a macro marketing approach to sustainable corporate marketing. This criticises the  traditional micro and short term economic strategies and its lack  of consideration for [[externalities]] and costs associated with environmental deterioration. What is fundamental to this approach is that despite company restraints, sustainable marketing practices can improve [[efficiency]] within corporations and looks to trade off between commercial and environmental concerns.&lt;ref name=VAN&gt;

{{cite journal |last=Van Dam |first=Y.K. |last2=Apeldoorn |first2=P.A.C. |date=1996 |title= Sustainable marketing|journal=Journal of Macromarketing |volume=16|issue=2 |pages=45–56 |doi=10.1177/027614679601600204}}

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Framework==

===Synthesis of market orientation and sustainability===

Market orientation has several definitions; Narver and Slater&lt;ref name=Narver&gt;
Narver, J. &amp; Slater, S. (1990) The Effect of a Market Orientation on Business Profitability. Journal of Marketing, 54 (4), 20-35.&lt;/ref&gt; discuss MO in terms of [[culture]] and the fundamental characteristics of the organisation. Kohli and Jaworski,&lt;ref&gt;Kohili, A. &amp; Jaworski, B. (1990) Market orientation: The construct, research propositions and managerial implications. Journal of Marketing, 54 (2), 1-18.&lt;/ref&gt; 1990 refer to MO as the organisation wide information generation and distribution and the appropriate responses to this information considering current and future customer needs. Key components of MO include market intelligence gathering and synthesis of market information to develop and implement competitive profitable marketing strategies.&lt;ref name=Cano&gt;Cano, C., Carrillat, F. &amp; Jaramillio, F. (2004) A meta-analysis of the relationship between market orientation and business performance: Evidence from five continents. International Journal of Research in Marketing, 21, 179-200.&lt;/ref&gt; A market oriented business knows that to maximise its long-run performance it must build and maintain long-running mutually beneficial relationships and be effective in creating sustainable competitive value for their [[customers]].&lt;ref name=Narver/&gt;

It has been noted MO has a need to address the interests of a spectrum of social, political and business (environmental) stakeholders by corporate management.&lt;ref name=Cano/&gt; Its current emphasis places internal corporate dynamics as the way to achieve efficiency and profitability. The combination of MO's emphasis on internal corporate dynamics with an added reliance on long-term external social and ecological interactions creates the concept of SMO. SMO allows companies to build on advantages gained through an MO strategy to create a greater alignment of long-term commercial performance with the interests of a wider range of stakeholders.&lt;ref name=Mitchell/&gt; The model of corporate SMO provides for a more comprehensive, stakeholder based approach to corporate management.

===Macromarketing===

An early version of sustainable marketing was proposed by van Dam and Apeldoorn&lt;ref name=VAN/&gt; through the combination of ecological marketing, green marketing and sustainable marketing, resulting in the concept 'environmental marketing'. Furthermore, Kilbourne, McDonagh and Prothero&lt;ref&gt;Kilbourne, W., &amp; McDonagh, P. (1997) Sustainable consumption and the quality of life: A macromarketing challenge to the dominant social paradigm. Journal of Macromarketing, 17 (4), 4-23.&lt;/ref&gt; recognised the dilemma of corporate reliance on the dominant social paradigm and [[micromarketing]]. A new marketing [[paradigm]] in which macromarketing takes the central role was suggested with the emphasis placed upon business embeddedness in social relationships.&lt;ref name=Mitchell/&gt; It was said corporate marketing management should manage economic, social, cultural and environmental considerations, however marketing practitioners focused on green marketing and overlooked these broader social and environmental responsibilities required.&lt;ref name=Mitchell/&gt;&lt;ref name=VAN/&gt; This is where macromarketing literature distinguishes MO from SMO. SMO combines the pursuit for economic benefits with the alignment of corporate marketing activity with social and environmental norms&lt;ref&gt;Varman, R. &amp; Costa, J. A. (2008) Embedded Markets, Communities, and the Invisible Hand of Social Norms. Journal of Macromarketing, 28, 141-156.&lt;/ref&gt; and offers a more comprehensive framework for sustainable marketing.&lt;ref name=Mitchell/&gt; The framework is supported by social, environmental and economic responsibilities.&lt;ref name=Mitchell/&gt;

===Corporate social responsibility===

As early as 1969, Lazer&lt;ref&gt;Lazer, W. (1969) Marketing's changing social relationships. Journal of Marketing, 33 (3), 3-9.&lt;/ref&gt; recognised a need to bridge the gap between the [[profit motive]] and [[social responsibility]]. Orlitzky, Schmidt, and Rynes&lt;ref&gt;Orlitzky, M., Schmidt, F. L. &amp; Rynes, S. L. (2003) Corporate Social and Financial Performance: A Meta-analysis. Organization Studies, 24 93), 403-441.&lt;/ref&gt; found corporate social performance and corporate financial performance are interlinked. MO holds little commitment for corporations to meet the social and environmental expectations of society. The importance of the combination of corporate social and economic responsibility with environmental responsibility is accounted for in the SMO model thus providing a more holistic approach to corporate marketing management.&lt;ref name=Mitchell/&gt;

===Sustainable development===

The MO paradigm guides corporate management with narrow ecological and environmental prescriptions. Sustainable development literature extends MO's parameters with less observance towards the dominant social paradigm and economic performance.&lt;ref name=Mitchell/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kilbourne, W., Beckmann, S. &amp; Thelen, E. (2002) The role of the dominant social paradigm in environmental attitudes: A multinational examination. Journal of Business Research, 55, 193-204.&lt;/ref&gt; In the past conceptualisations of sustainable corporate management and sustainable marketing have often focused on the micromanagement of ecological issues. This only recently has been developed past these views.&lt;ref name=Sheth/&gt;&lt;ref name=VAN/&gt; SMO moves towards corporate marketing meeting market expectations of the responsible application of resources, environmental and social responsibility.&lt;ref name=Mitchell/&gt;

==Benefits==

If a firm applies SMO to their corporate management strategy it offers them a more socially and environmentally responsible business framework for profitable marketing activity to more effectively sustain long term competitiveness and survival. A firm that utilises SMO are hypothesised to gain enhancement of both brand and firm reputation based on the ability for them to have both efficient and competitive products and services.&lt;ref name=Mitchell/&gt; This is also complemented by societal and market recognition of the firm holding superior social and environmental management. The critical driver for these benefits to the firm will be the integration of organisational intelligence systems, [[innovation]] and continuous learning that inform and proactive marketing strategy.&lt;ref name=Mitchell/&gt;
 
Looking beyond the market place, adopting the SMO perspective will bring forth a greater understanding of societal issues and concerns. Also as SMO becomes a more integrated part of political development, it will highlight potential areas of business risk and areas where new business opportunities may lie.&lt;ref name=VAN/&gt;  
 
SMO is a new systematic approach to marketing management that will ensure value to a diverse range of stakeholders by applying management criteria that will add value and assessing to internationally recognised [[Economic indicator|indicator]]s.

==Evaluation==

SMO firms will be evaluated at a [[company]], [[local community]], or regional level due to the employment of a macromarketing systems approach.Firms can no longer simply focus on the micro or internal environment of their organisations.
 
When evaluating SMO both proven MO indicators and sustainable development indicators should be used as a starting point.&lt;ref name=Mitchell/&gt; A firm must have capabilities in intelligence generation, organisation coordination, customer orientation, competitor orientation, [[responsiveness]] and profit orientation in response to a range of internal (including employees, [[investors]], customers, and [[business partners]]) and external (including [[special interest groups]], local communities, government, [[regulator (economics)|regulator]]s, and the [[News media|media]]) stakeholders.&lt;ref&gt;Dobscha, S., Mentzer, J. &amp; Littlefield, J. (1994)  Do external factors play an antecedent role to market orientation? Developments in marketing science, 17, 333-37.&lt;/ref&gt; Alignment of corporate marketing management to recognise sustainable management principles such as [[sustainable consumption]] and brand management should also be incorporated when assessing a firm's commitment to SMO.&lt;ref name=Mitchell/&gt;

==Later developments==

===Hult and Tomas===
Hult and Tomas have developed further the issue of sustainability, with regards to market orientation. They highlight that in order for an organisation to achieve market-based sustainability they must strategically align themselves with both the consumers wants and needs of a market-orientated product and the interests of the multiple stakeholders concerned about the social responsibility issues involving economic, environmental (ecological), and social dimensions.&lt;ref&gt;Hult, G., Tomas. M. (2010) Market-focused sustainability: market orientation plus! Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science, 39(1): 1-6.&lt;/ref&gt; There is also great emphasis on the importance of the Bruntland Report as the underlying backdrop for both academic and managerial work on sustainability.

==Industry application==

===Tourism===
SMO is becoming increasingly prevalent in the [[tourism]] industry with a shift from economic profit priorities towards sustainability and a sustainable tourism marketing model.&lt;ref name=Jamrozy&gt;Jamrozy, U. (2007) Marketing of tourism: a paradigm shift toward sustainability. International Journal of Culture, Tourism and Hospitality Research, 1 (2), 117-130.&lt;/ref&gt; The emergence of this shift towards sustainability includes the concept of sustainable development put forward by the Brundtland Commission and the preservation of the environment for future use.&lt;ref&gt;Berry, S. &amp; Ladkin, A. (1997) Sustainable tourism: a regional perspective. Tourism Management, 18 (7), 433-440.&lt;/ref&gt; The sustainability approach adopts an integrated view of marketing, the consideration of [[social equity]], environmental protection, and economic liveability. This paradigm shift traces the evolution of marketing approaches from a consumer oriented basis towards societal, causal, green, relationship marketing alongside the consideration of the triple bottom line.&lt;ref name=Jamrozy/&gt; Empirical research into the practical application of the SMO as a management model in the New Zealand tourism sector \found alignment of the SMO model alignment in the strategy management of a government conservation agency and tourism SMEs. The researchers recommended replication research and evaluation in other sectors and countries.&lt;ref name = Mitchell2&gt;Mitchell,R.W.&amp; Wooliscroft, B., Higham, J.(2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Forestry===
Alongside tourism, the [[forestry]] industry is adapting to the paradigm shift and moving towards the embodiment of the principles of sustainable forest management. This industry recognises its responsibility to future generations and the environment. There are many other industries that could benefit from sustainable practices demonstrated in the forestry industry.&lt;ref&gt;Nambiar, S. E. K. (1997) Pursuit of Sustainable Plantation Forestry. The Southern African Forestry Journal, 184 (1), 45-62.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Agriculture===
Climate change is already affecting the agriculture sector.
The net effect of climate change on world agriculture is likely to be negative, although some regions and crops will benefit, most will not. Adaptation play a significant role in reducing the climate change negative impact on agriculture and increase benefit from climate change (Easterling 1996). Producers can adapt by changing seeding dates, Dynamic fertilization and irrigation applications, and switching one crop to another according to climate changes
(Barklacich and Stewart 1995).

'''ToolBank''' is a registered term or 'word mark' registered with the U.S. Patent &amp; Trademark Office used to identify the nonprofit tool lending program model created by the [http://atlanta.toolbank.org Atlanta Community ToolBank]. Each ToolBank increases the impact of its local charitable sector by lending tools to organizations for use in the fulfillment of their missions. The available inventory of a typical ToolBank includes tools for landscaping, carpentry, plumbing, masonry as well as power tools, ladders, wheelbarrows, and others. The Atlanta Community ToolBank is currently the largest ToolBank in existence, with over 200 tool types in its lending inventory. The available inventory of the Atlanta Community ToolBank can be found [http://atlanta.toolbank.org/Portals/18/TRF.pdf here]{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}. Nine ToolBanks are currently lending tools in Atlanta GA, Baltimore MD, Charlotte NC, Cincinnati OH, Houston TX, Phoenix AZ, Portland OR, Richmond VA, and Chicago, IL. The national network of ToolBanks is administered by the parent organization [http://www.toolbank.org ToolBank USA], which was founded in 2008 to replicate the impact of the Atlanta ToolBank in cities beyond Atlanta. In 2014, ToolBank USA launched ToolBank Disaster Services, a program to deliver tools to communities affected by disaster. ToolBanks loaned $5.8M worth of tools and equipment to charitable organizations in 2015.   

The ToolBank program model differs from the more common [[tool library]] model in that ToolBanks loan tools exclusively to other charitable organizations; ToolBank tools are not available to individuals. The ToolBank inventory is designated for the purpose of increasing the impact of the nonprofit sector and less formalized grassroots organizations. Typical borrowers of ToolBank tools include faith-based organizations, public schools, neighborhood organizations, public/private partnerships with community-oriented missions, social clubs with a service mission, gardening clubs, and others. Proof of charitable intent is verified prior to accessing ToolBank tools.

The ToolBank performs three primary functions:

1. '''Tool Lending:''' The ToolBank lends tools of all kinds for use in volunteer projects, facility maintenance and improvement projects, community improvement events, and special events.

2. '''Tool Advocacy:''' ToolBank staff advocates for the complete and timely return of all borrowed tools, to guarantee the long-term sustainability of available inventory. Staff also seeks compensation for lost tools and tools returned late.

3. '''Tool Maintenance:''' The ToolBank performs [[Planned maintenance|routine maintenance]] and repairs on all equipment to ensure good condition and to extend the lifespan of the inventory. This function is typically performed by volunteers and community service workers.

Through these three functions, local community organizations may benefit by:&lt;br /&gt;
ensuring that all participating volunteers are properly equipped;&lt;br /&gt;

'''ToolBank''' is a registered mark of the Atlanta Community ToolBank.&lt;ref&gt;{{US servicemark|78934493}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Atlanta Community ToolBank granted a Right to License to [http://www.toolbank.org ToolBank USA] in 2008. ToolBank USA is a nonprofit organization created in February 2008, charged with the successful nationwide replication of the ToolBank program model. ToolBank USA was launched by a founding grant from [http://www.homedepotfoundation.org/ The Home Depot Foundation].

== History ==

The '''Atlanta Community ToolBank''' originated in Atlanta GA as an offshoot of a charitable no-cost home repair program known as Community Reinvestment Inc (CRI), founded in 1990.  CRI's tool inventory grew organically as a result of volunteers donating equipment in support of the program.  Local neighborhood associations and churches periodically borrowed CRI's tools for their own cleanup days and volunteer events, giving rise to the core concept of the ToolBank.  The specific origin of the term ToolBank is unknown; CRI began offering the ToolBank as a formal program in 1992.

The '''United Artists Theatre Building''' is a [[vacant]] [[high-rise]] tower in downtown [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]], standing at 150 Bagley Avenue. It was built in 1928 and stands 18 stories tall. The building was designed by architect [[C. Howard Crane]] in the [[renaissance revival]] architectural style, and is made mainly of [[brick]]. Until December 29, 1971, it was a first-run movie house and office space, and then after that, the theatre saw sporadic usage until 1973. The [[United Artists]] Theatre, designed in a [[Spanish Gothic architecture|Spanish-Gothic design]], sat 2,070 people, and after closing served from 1978 to 1983 as the [[Detroit Symphony Orchestra]]'s recording theater. After the theater closed, the office block struggled as tenants moved to suburbs. It finally closed in 1984. An original 10-story, vertical UA sign was replaced in the 1950s with a [[marquee (sign)|marquee]] that remained until 2005. The building once shared a lot with the now demolished [[Hotel Tuller]].

In preparation for the [[Super Bowl XL|2006 NFL Super Bowl]], graffiti was removed from all the windows of the building, and the lower levels received a coat of black paint to hide the [[graffiti]] work at the base of the building. The old theater marquee was also removed.

In 2006, [[Ilitch Holdings, Inc.|Ilitch Holdings]] announced it would market the building.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Lisa M.

Usman Boie Kamara unsuccessfully sought the nomination of the SLPP for the [[Sierra Leone presidential election, 2012|2012 presidential election]], placing second behind former [[Military dictatorship|military ruler]] [[Julius Maada Bio]], who won the SLPP nomination at the party's convention held on 31 July 2011 at the miatta hall in Freetown.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.sierraexpressmedia.com/archives/27181 |title=Archived copy |access-date=17 November 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120527150221/http://www.sierraexpressmedia.com/archives/27181 |archive-date=27 May 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After losing the election to Julius Maada Bio on 31 July 2011, there were great division among SLPP supporters and within the SLPP party itself. [http://www.sierraleoneview.com/news174.html] Some SLPP officials, including the SLPP chairman of the [[Western Area]] branch [[Lansana Fadika]], the party's young generation leader [[Blamoh Robert]] and regional Secretary [[Alpha Mohamed Alghali]] resigned from the party in protest at Bio's nomination.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cocorioko.net/?p=16735|title=DSC01227 – Cocorioko|website=www.cocorioko.net|language=en-US|access-date=2018-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of Usman Boie's supporters called for him to leave the SLPP and form his own party to challenge President [[Ernest Bai Koroma]].

However, on 4 September 2011 Usman Boie delivered a speech in front of 15,000 of his supporters and senior members of the SLPP at the Attouga Stadium in Freetown.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sierraexpressmedia.com/archives/17745&lt;/ref&gt; In his speech, he called for unity within the SLPP and gave his full support to Maada Bio ahead of the 2012 presidential election. Usman Boie stated that nothing would stop the SLPP from winning the 2012 elections and party members should be focused on how to win the 2012 elections.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thenewpeople.com/front-page/item/1214-usman-boie-kamara-is-still-slpp&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sierraexpressmedia.com/archives/29027&lt;/ref&gt; Osman Boie focused his speech on criticising President Koroma's government.

In June 2012, Usman Boie Kamara surprisingly defected from the SLPP and joined the ruling APC. He was officially welcomed and given an APC membership card by President Koroma himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thepatrioticvanguard.com/spip.php?article6559|title=Freetown: Usman Boie Kamara and YD Kamara Join APC|last=Vanguard|first=The Patriotic|date=2012-06-11|work=The Patriotic Vanguard|access-date=2018-06-25|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2013, Usman Boie Kamara was chosen by President Koroma to serve as Minister of Trade and Industry in his new second term cabinet. He was approved by the [[Sierra Leone House of Parliament]] on 15 January 2013&lt;ref&gt;http://en.starafrica.com/news/sleone-mps-give-nod-to-12-govt-appointees.html&lt;/ref&gt; and was sworn in as Minister of Trade and Industry on 16 January 2013 at [[State House (Sierra Leone)|State House]] in Freetown.

In 1882, in [[Bordeaux]], France, Bacon married [[Virginia P. Bacon|Virginia Purdy Barker]], the youngest granddaughter of business magnate, [[Cornelius Vanderbilt]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Standard'', Friday March 10, issue 1785 (London: 1882), p. 1. Accessed through ''19th Century British Library Newspapers Part II''&lt;/ref&gt; Bacon and his wife spent most of their time abroad, particularly in London and at Netherdale Estate, their Manor house in [[Turriff]], Scotland. However, after the outbreak of [[World War I]] travel to Europe became more difficult and the Bacons remained in New York.&lt;ref name="jstor.org"&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/25589459?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents ''American Art News'', April 12, 1919]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="jstor.org"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Social Register, Summer ...: Contains the Summer Addresses of Residents of New York, Washington, Philadelphia, Chicago, Boston and Baltimore|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ffZBAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA15|year=1913|publisher=Social Register Association|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Walter, with his brother [[Edward R. Bacon]], a lawyer, acted as president of the Knickerbocker Apartments at 247 Fifth Avenue, where the two lived with Walter's wife.&lt;ref&gt;[http://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1917/11/15/102650638.html?pageNumber=13 ''New York Times'' November 15, 1917]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/ldpd_5767518_000#page/n23/mode/2up| ''The Elite of New York, Society List and Club' Register'', New York, 1915, pg. 17&lt;/ref&gt; The Knickerbocker apartments, in William B. Duncan's former mansion, were sold to the newly formed gentlemen's club, the [[Knickerbocker Club]]. The Knickerbocker club was formed out of the [[Union Club of the City of New York]], by a group of members exasperated with the admittance of younger, less traditional members.&lt;ref&gt;[http://daytoninmanhattan.blogspot.com/2012/09/the-lost-1882-knickerbocker-apartments.html Tom Miller, ''The Lost 1882 Knickerbocker Apartments'', September 3, 2012]&lt;/ref&gt; Walter was also a member of [[Racquet and Tennis Club]], in New York and The [[Reform Club]], in London.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ZJVYAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=walter+rathbone+bacon+reform+club&amp;dq=walter+rathbone+bacon+reform+club&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCcQ6wEwAGoVChMI4YKinK-mxwIVAVc-Ch22GQDk| D.
