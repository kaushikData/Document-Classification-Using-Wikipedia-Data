The '''2009 Sulawesi superbolide''' was an atmospheric [[Meteoroid#Fireball|fireball]] blast over Indonesia on October 8, 2009, at approximately 03:00 UTC, near the coastal city of [[Watampone]] (colloquially named ''Bone'') in [[South Sulawesi]], island of [[Sulawesi]]. The [[meteorite|meteoritic]] impactor broke up at an estimated height of 15–20&amp;nbsp;km. The impact energy of the [[bolide]] was estimated in the 10 to 50 kiloton [[TNT]] equivalent range with the higher end of this range being more likely. The likely size of the impactor was 5–10 m diameter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://neo.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news165.html | publisher=[[NASA]] | title=Asteroid Impactor Reported over Indonesia | work= | date=23 October 2009 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091102151757/http://neo.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news165.html | archivedate=2009-11-02 | deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/space/6444895/Asteroid-explosion-over-Indonesia-raises-fears-about-Earths-defences.html | work=The Telegraph | title=Asteroid explosion over Indonesia raises fears about Earth's defences | publisher= | date=27 October 2009 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091029051403/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/space/6444895/Asteroid-explosion-over-Indonesia-raises-fears-about-Earths-defences.html | archivedate=2009-10-29 | deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/33540411/ns/technology_and_science-space | work=NBC News | title=Asteroid explosion was a whopper for Earth | publisher= | date=29 October 2009 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130825142803/http://www.nbcnews.com/id/33540411/ns/technology_and_science-space | archivedate=2013-08-25 | deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.space.com/7464-huge-explosion-biggest-space-rock-strike-earth-1994.html | work=Space.com | title=Huge Explosion Was Biggest Space Rock to Strike Earth Since 1994 | publisher= | date=29 October 2009 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110130064252/http://www.space.com/7464-huge-explosion-biggest-space-rock-strike-earth-1994.html | archivedate=2011-01-30 | deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background and purpose ==
Citing the home site:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The International Arctic Research Center (IARC) at the University of Alaska Fairbanks (UAF) was established in 1999 as a cooperative research institute supported by both the U.S. and Japanese governments. Funding comes from the National Science Foundation and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in the U.S. and from the Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology, and Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency.

IARC serves as a focal point of excellence for international collaboration and provides the Arctic research community with an unprecedented opportunity to share knowledge about science in the Arctic, with an emphasis on global change research. The primary mission of the IARC is to nurture, integrate and synthesize research being conducted internationally by individuals and groups in order to identify natural and man-made changes. More than 20 international groups and more than 60 scientists are collaborating with IARC, allowing the institute to meet the UAF mission and goals in a concrete way.

IARC is devoting specific effort to answering the following three questions: (1) Is climate change due to natural or man-made causes? (2) What parameters, processes and interactions are needed to understand and predict future climate change? and (3) What are the likely impacts of climate change?
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Caipora.jpg|thumb]]
'''Caipora''' {{IPA-pt|kajˈpɔɾɐ}} is an entity of the [[Tupi people|Tupi]]-[[Guarani people|Guarani]] mythology in [[Brazil]]. The word "Caipora" comes from tupi and means "inhabitant of the forest".

It is represented as a dark-skinned, small Indian, naked with a very long black mane, smoking a cigar and very mischievous. Sometimes Caipora is depicted as a girl and other times as a boy. The representation of the creature varies among the different regions of Brazil, and is sometimes confused with [[Curupira]], which is another mythological creature who protects the forest. Curupira is often depicted as a boy with red hair, who has his feet turned backwards in order to deceive trackers.

In some regions, the indigenous tribes believed that the Caipora was afraid of the light. For this reason, they would walk around the forest protecting themselves using firebrands.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.suapesquisa.com/folclorebrasileiro/lenda_caipora.htm|title=Lenda do Caipora - origem, história, folclore, imagem|last=Digital|first=CacauLimão Comunicação|website=www.suapesquisa.com|access-date=2017-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some say it rides a great [[peccary]] holding a stick. In some other areas of Brazil, the Caipora is considered to be a cannibal and would eat anything, even the smallest insects.

The Caipora is known as a forest dweller, as a king of the animals of sorts, and is very vengeful of hunters who do not respect the rules of "fair-play" when hunting. It is told that it scares away prey and "hides" animal tracks or makes hunters lose their way in the jungle. It disorients the hunters by simulating animal noises and by leaving fake tracks.

According to a popular belief, his activity intensifies on those days in which hunting is not supposed to take place, therefore on Fridays, Sundays and the religious days. Religious beliefs prohibited hunting on certain days, but there are claims about ways to trick the protector of the forest. It is known that the Caipora likes smoke, so on Thursday nights, the hunters would leave smoke by the trunk of a tree and say "Toma, Caipora, deixa eu ir embora" &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.mundoporterra.com.br/educacional/quem-e-a-caipora/|title=Quem é a caipora?|date=2014-10-03|work=Mundo por Terra|access-date=2017-03-26|language=pt-BR}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://nuhtaradahab.wordpress.com/category/folclore-brasileiro/page/7/|title=Folclore Brasileiro {{!}} Oceano de Letras {{!}} Página 7|website=nuhtaradahab.wordpress.com|language=pt-BR|access-date=2017-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;(which means "Here you go, Caipora, let me leave" in Portuguese). The good luck of hunters is also due to the propitiatory gifts that were offered to the creature.

==Pop culture references==
In the children's TV series ''[[Castelo Rá-Tim-Bum]]'', Caipora is a regular character.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://entretenimento.r7.com/famosos-e-tv/fotos/volta-caipora-ao-completar-20-anos-de-castelo-ra-tim-bum-atriz-comemora-com-parte-do-elenco-18072014|title=Volta, Caipora! Ao completar 20 anos de Castelo Rá Tim Bum, atriz comemora com parte do elenco - Fotos - R7 TV e Entretenimento|author=|date=|website=entretenimento.r7.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this version is characterized as a female creature with a big red fur and a black mask. She has the ability to teleport when hear whistles and sometimes demonstrates wild aspects. The character has also made an appearance in a TV adaptation of [[Sítio do Picapau Amarelo (novel series)|Sítio do Picapau Amarelo]], but being a male creature.

In ''Harry Potter'', the Caipora protect the magical school Castelobruxo in Brazil. They are described as small, furry, and extremely mischievous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pottermore.com/writing-by-jk-rowling/castelobruxo|title=Castelobruxo - Pottermore|author=|date=|website=pottermore.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses of the word "Caipora" and its derivatives==
In the northeast area of Brazil, they say that being Caipora means that you are going through tough times, with bad luck and unhappiness.

Some Brazilian writers, which include [[Machado de Assis]] and [[Aluísio Azevedo|Aluísio de Azevedo]], used the words "Caipora" and "Caiporism" to identify a state of misfortune.

The word "Caipora" has also been used to describe the slaves who had escaped into the forests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Radunoz|first1=Roberto|last2=Giron|first2=Loraine|title="Invisíveis: negros nas memórias dos brancos."|journal=Revista Brasileira de História &amp; Ciências Sociais|date=July 2012|volume=7|issue=4|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6065">'''Carbon-based fuel''' is any [[fuel]]   principally from the [[oxidation]] or burning of [[carbon]].   Carbon-based fuels are of two main kinds, [[biofuel]]s &lt;!-- or [[biomass]] --&gt; and [[fossil fuel]]s. Whereas biofuels are derived from recent-growth organic matter&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1016/j.apenergy.2009.04.036| title = Political, economic and environmental impacts of biofuels: A review| year = 2009| last1 = Demirbas | first1 = A. .| journal = Applied Energy| volume = 86| pages = S108–S117 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and are typically harvested, as with logging of forests and cutting of corn, fossil fuels are of prehistoric origin&lt;ref&gt;Paul Mann, Lisa Gahagan, and Mark B. Gordon, "Tectonic setting of the world's giant oil and gas fields," in [[Michel T. Halbouty]] (ed.) [https://books.google.com/books?id=mrghwzjeU-AC&amp;pg=PA50&amp;lpg=PA50&amp;dq=%22precambrian+oil%22+halbouty&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=xGS8yx9cUn&amp;sig=kAQvoCdognlM-k0bDI2ZLCj5ri4&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=bo8_SoSNJZPCsQPYgvS6Dw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1 ''Giant Oil and Gas Fields of the Decade, 1990-1999''], Tulsa, Okla.: [[American Association of Petroleum Geologists]], p.50, accessed 22 June 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; and are extracted from the ground, the principal fossil fuels being [[Petroleum|oil]], [[coal]], and [[natural gas]].

From an economic policy perspective, an important distinction between biofuels and fossil fuels is that only the former is [[sustainable energy|sustainable]] or [[renewable energy|renewable]]. 

Whereas we can continue to obtain energy from biofuels indefinitely in principle, the Earth's reserves of fossil fuels was determined millions of years ago&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Dr. Irene Novaczek|title=Canada's Fossil Fuel Dependency|url=http://www.elements.nb.ca/theme/fuels/irene/novaczek.htm|publisher=Elements.nb.ca |accessdate =2007-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is therefore fixed as far as our foreseeable future is concerned.  The great variability in the ease of extraction of fossil fuels however makes its endgame scenario one of increasing prices over one or more centuries rather than of abrupt exhaustion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.netl.doe.gov/publications/others/pdf/Oil_Peaking_NETL.pdf |title=Microsoft Word - NETL Final Report, 2-05.doc |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2009-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the perspective of climate and [[ecology]], biofuels and fossil fuels have in common that they contribute to the production of [[atmospheric carbon dioxide]], which has emerged in recent decades as the fastest-changing [[greenhouse gas]], whose principal impacts are [[global warming]] and [[ocean acidification]].  However biofuels actively participate in the [[carbon cycle]] today by photosynthesizing carbon dioxide, unlike fossil fuels whose participation was long ago, and can therefore in principle bring atmospheric CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; into an equilibrium not possible with the continued use of fossil fuel.  But in practice [[photosynthesis]] is a slow process, and the additional fuel produced by artificial methods of accelerating it such as application of fertilizer tends to be offset by the energy consumed by the accelerating processes,&lt;ref&gt;[http://petroleum.berkeley.edu/papers/Biofuels/NRRethanol.2005.pdf Pimentel-Patzek report] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070809024158/http://petroleum.berkeley.edu/papers/Biofuels/NRRethanol.2005.pdf |date=2007-08-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; to a degree currently under active debate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eerc.ra.utk.edu/etcfc/docs/pr/PimentelStudy-NBBDetailedResponse~July05.pdf  National Biodiesel Board response to Pimentel] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080518055658/http://eerc.ra.utk.edu/etcfc/docs/pr/PimentelStudy-NBBDetailedResponse~July05.pdf |date=May 18, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In contrast the speed of photosynthesis is immaterial for fossil fuels because they had millions of years in which to accumulate. Burning of both fossil fuels and biofuels usually also produces [[carbon monoxide]], which is toxic and can kill a person after mixing with the haemoglobin of the blood, increasing its concentration in the body. Biofuels and fossil fuels may also produce many other [[Air pollution|air pollutants]] depending on the contents of the fuel.

[[Image:Caissa.jpg|thumb|An early illustration of [[William Jones (philologist)|Jones's]] ''Caïssa'' ([[Domenico Maria Fratta|Fratta]])]]

'''Caïssa''' is a fictional [[Thrace|Thracian]] [[dryad]] portrayed as the goddess of [[chess]], as invented during the Renaissance by Italian poet [[Marco Girolamo Vida|Hieronymus Vida]].

==Vida's poem==
Caïssa originated in a 658-line poem called ''Scacchia Ludus'' published in 1527 by [[Marco Girolamo Vida|Hieronymus Vida]] (Marco Girolamo Vida), which describes in Latin Virgilian [[hexameter]]s a chess game between [[Apollo]] and [[Mercury (god)|Mercury]] in the presence of the other gods. In it, to avoid unclassical words such as ''rochus'' (chess rook) or ''alfinus'' (chess bishop), the [[Rook (chess)|rooks]] are described as towers (armored [[howdah]]s) on [[elephant]]s' backs, and the [[Bishop (chess)|bishops]] as [[Archery|archer]]s:

{{poemquote| 
Tum geminae velut extremis in cornibus arces      
hinc atque hinc altis stant propugnacula muris,       
quae dorso immanes gestant in bella Elephanti.

"Then twin, as if at the ends, citadels in the corners,
here and here stand ramparts with high walls,
which, immense, are carried into war on the back by elephants."}}

A leaked unauthorized 742-line draft version was published in 1525. Its text is very different, and in it Caïssa is called Scacchia, the chess rook is a [[cyclops]], and the chess bishop is a [[centaur]] archer.

This led to the modern name "castle" for the chess rook, and thus the term "castling", and the modern shape of the European rook chesspiece. Also for a time, some chess players in Europe called the rook "elephant" and the bishop "archer". In German, ''Schütze'' ("archer") became a general word for a chess bishop until displaced by ''Läufer'' ("runner") in the 18th century.&lt;ref name=Murray&gt;{{Citation | last=Murray | first=H. J. R. | authorlink=H. J. R. Murray | title=[[A History of Chess]]|publisher=Benjamin Press (originally published by Oxford University Press)| year=1913 | isbn=0-936317-01-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==William Jones's poem==
The young English orientalist [[Sir William Jones|William Jones]] re-used the idea of a Chess poem in 1763, in his own poem ''Caïssa Or The Game at Chess''&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.de/books?id=b0LVAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA450&amp;lpg=PA450&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=_iOm0UWrby&amp;sig=vUgpCLg8kY1jHoMMMrPmqFXwh1o&amp;hl=de&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=wP8xVe7GEYzraIq1gKAE&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;f=false The Works of the English Poets, from Chaucer to Cowper; … edited … by Dr. Samuel Johnson … Vol. XVIII. London: … 1810.]&lt;/ref&gt; written in English [[hexameter]]s. In his poem, Caïssa initially repels the advances of the god of war, [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]]. Spurned, Mars seeks the aid of the god Euphron (Jones's invention), brother of [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]], who creates the game of chess as a gift for Mars to win Caïssa's favor.

It is an unproven assumption that Jones's name "Caïssa" (ka-is-sa) is an equivalent to Vida's name "Scacchia" (ska-ki-a).

The English version of Philidor's Introduction to Chess&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=[[François-André Danican Philidor|Philidor, F.A.]]|year=1777|title=Systematic introduction to the game and the analysis of chess (L’analyze des échecs)|publisher=London|edition=Fifth|pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=o5UCAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA12 12]–20}}&lt;/ref&gt; contained Jones's poem. In 1851 the poem was translated into French by Camille Théodore Frédéric Alliey.&lt;ref&gt;Poèmes sur le jeu des Échecs ... traduits en français par Frédéric Alliey, Magistrat. ... Paris. ... 1851.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern use==
Caïssa is referred to in chess commentary.
* [[Garry Kasparov]] uses this reference now and again, especially in his five-volume work ''[[My Great Predecessors]]''. It is used as a substitute for being fortunate – "Caïssa was with me" – especially in unclear situations, for example in [[sacrifice (chess)|sacrifices]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=[[Garry Kasparov|Kasparov, Garry]]|title=Garry Kasparov on My Great Predecessors, Part 1|publisher=Everyman Chess|edition=First|isbn=1-85744-330-6|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The book ''The March of Chess Ideas'' by [[Anthony Saidy]] extensively uses Caïssa as well.
* [[Thomas Rayner Dawson|T. R. Dawson]] extensively used Caïssa, both as a character to provide literary narrative to accompany his problem collections,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Dawson | first = Thomas Rayner | authorlink = Thomas Rayner Dawson | year = 1947 | title = Caissa's Fairy Tales | publisher = Privately published by the author | location = Croydon, England | pages = 31-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; or merely as a convenient anthropomorphism of chess.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | first = Thomas Rayner | last = Dawson | authorlink = Thomas Rayner Dawson | title = Caissa's Playthings | url = http://www.theproblemist.org/trd-cplay.html | work = Cheltenham Examiner | date = 1913-07-10 | accessdate = 2013-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Caïssa as a concept has also been explored by some who seek the evidence of the [[sacred feminine]] in chess.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}

The first computer program that won the [[World Computer Chess Championship]] (in 1974) was named [[Kaissa]].

The card game [[Android: Netrunner]] features a program type named Caïssa, which are modeled after chess pieces.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4293">A '''double diode triode''' is a type of electronic [[vacuum tube]] once widely used in [[radio]] receivers.  The tube has a [[triode]] for amplification, along with two diodes, one typically for use as a detector and the other as a rectifier for [[automatic gain control]], in one envelope. In practice the two diodes usually share a common cathode. Multiple tube sections in one envelope minimized the number of tubes required in a radio or other apparatus.

In [[Mullard–Philips tube designation|European nomenclature]] a first letter "E" identifies tubes with heaters to be connected in parallel to a transformer winding of 6.3&amp;nbsp;V; "A" identifies similar 4&amp;nbsp;V; "U" identifies tubes with heaters to be connected in series across the mains supply, drawing 100&amp;nbsp;mA; "H" identifies similar 150&amp;nbsp;mA, "C" identifies similar 200&amp;nbsp;mA, and "P" identifies similar 300&amp;nbsp;mA series-connected tubes. Following the voltage letter, "A" stands for a low-current (signal) diode section, "B" for a double diode with common cathode section, "C" for a triode section, "F" for a pentode section, "H" for a hexode or heptode section, and "L" for a power tetrode or pentode section. The first number identified the base type, for example '''3''' for Octal base; '''9''' for B7G sub-miniature 7 pin. The remaining numbers identified a particular tube type; tubes with all characters except the first identical had identical electrodes but a different heater; e.g. the EBC81 and UBC81. Generally, odd numbers identified tubes / valves with variable mu characteristics and even numbers straight, or sharp cut-off types.  

American nomenclature, also used in Europe, used a number to identify the heater voltage, then one or two sequentially assigned letters, then a number specifying the total number of electrodes plus one. The 6.3V EABC80 has 7 electrodes; the US equivalent are 6AK8 and 6T8, where the "AK" and "T" have no particular meaning; the 6N8 (EBF80) is a dual diode+pentode with 7 electrodes.

There are many double diode triode tubes, including EBC81 (6BD7), EBC90 (6AT6), EBC91 (6AV6) and the older EBC1, EBC2, EBC11, EBC21, EBC33, EBC41 (identical to EBC81 but Rimlock (B8A) socket instead of noval), ABC1 (EBC1 with a 4&amp;nbsp;V heater), CBC1 (EBC1 with a 200&amp;nbsp;mA heater). The commoner tube line-ups of an AM-only radio set with mains transformer having a double diode-triode were one of the following: ECH11+EF11+EBC11+EL11 Y8A Base -''or''- ECH42(or 41)+EF42(or 41)+ EBC41+ EL41(or 42) Rimlock Base -''or''- ECH81+EF80(or 85 or 89)+ EBC81(or 91)+ EL84 (noval Socket) + rectifier and magic eye indicator (depending on the radio class and manufacturer). AC/DC sets without mains transformer would use "U" tubes of the same types, e.g. UCH42+UF41+UBC41+UL41+UY41 rectifier.

There was also a tube with a double diode and a triode sharing a common cathode, and an additional, independent single diode section, named EABC80 or 6AK8 or 6T8 (with a shorter glass envelope) and its versions for AC/DC transformerless receivers with series heater chains, named PABC80 (9AK8, 300&amp;nbsp;mA for TV sets), HABC80 (19T8, 150&amp;nbsp;mA for radios) and UABC80 (27AK8, 100&amp;nbsp;mA for radios). This tube was designed for early AM/FM (MW/VHF) radio sets and was widely used until the end of the tube era; the double diode was used for [[Foster–Seeley discriminator|FM demodulation]], the third, independent diode for [[Detector (radio)#Envelope detector|AM detection]] and/or [[automatic gain control]] (AGC).

The main configurations for an early tube AM/FM set using EABC80 in the 1950s and '60s were:

EC92+EF80(or 85 or 89)+ECH81+EF80(or 85 or 89)+EABC80+EL84(or 95) -''or''- ECC85+EF80(or 85 or 89)+ECH81+EABC80+EL84(or 95)+ rectifier (tube or solid state) and indicator, depending on the radio class and manufacturer. For AC/DC radios, UCC85+UCH81+UF80(or 85 or 89)+UABC80+UL84+ rectifier and indicator. These configurations were kept until semiconductor (germanium) diodes became available, making this type of tube obsolete.

The '''Energy Efficiency Directive 2012/27/EU''' (abbreviated '''EED''') is a [[European Union directive]] which mandates [[efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] improvements within the [[European Union]].&lt;ref name="directive-2012-27-ec"&gt;
{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|2}}  The directive introduces legally binding measures to encourage efforts to use energy more efficiently in all stages and sectors of the supply chain.  It establishes a common framework for the promotion of energy efficiency within the EU in order to meet its energy efficiency headline target of 20% by 2020.  It also paves the way for further improvements thereafter.&lt;ref name="build-up-2012"&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

The directive provides for the establishment of indicative national energy efficiency targets for 2020.  [[member states of the European Union|Member states]] were to have submitted their National Energy Efficiency Action Plans (NEEAP) by 30 April 2014, outlining the measures they have implemented to improve energy efficiency and their expected and/or achieved energy savings.  In addition, member states are required to report annually on progress toward their national targets.  The policy requirements in the directive are minimum obligations and member states may introduce more stringent measures.&lt;ref name="build-up-2012"/&gt;

The Energy Efficiency Directive 2012/27/EU was preceded by the Energy Services Directive 2006/32/EC.&lt;ref name="national-energy-efficiency-action-plans"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; This earlier directive contained a target of a 9% reduction in energy usage within 9{{nbsp}}years of the directive coming into force.  The earlier directive also required EU members to submit National Energy Efficiency Action Plans, with the first plan to be lodged by 30 June 2007.

On 23 July 2014 the [[European Commission]] announced a new target of a 30% improvement in energy efficiency by 2030.&lt;ref name="harvey-2013"&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

== Development ==

Documents leaked in {{nowrap|mid-2012}} show that the United Kingdom repeatedly fought to water down key measures during the development of the directive and forced some measures to become voluntary rather than mandatory.&lt;ref name="harvey-2012-a"&gt;
{{cite news

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;  As a result, a new version of the directive allows member states to set their own energy efficiency targets, instead of the original requirement of a mandatory {{nowrap|EU-wide}} target of 20% improvement.&lt;ref name="harvey-2012-b"&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

== Measures ==

The directive promotes rules to remove [[barriers to entry|barriers]] in energy markets and to overcome [[market failure]]s that may impede the uptake of energy efficiency.  Under the directive, the public sector is to play an exemplary role and consumers will have a right to know how much energy they consume.&lt;ref name="build-up-2012"/&gt;

The following categories are covered by the directive:&lt;ref name="build-up-2012"/&gt;

* energy efficiency targets
* building renovation
* an exemplary role for public buildings
* energy efficiency obligation schemes
* [[energy audit]]s and [[energy management]] systems
* metering and billing information systems and the right to access this data
* consumer information and empowerment
* promotion of efficiency in heating and cooling
* energy transformation, transmission, and distribution
* availability of qualification, accreditation, and certification schemes
* information and training
* energy services
* an energy efficiency national fund, financing, and technical support
* other measures to promote energy efficiency

== National Energy Efficiency Action Plans and Annual Reports ==

Individual National Energy Efficiency Action Plans (NEEAP) for 2014 and Annual Reports for 2016 are available for download.&lt;ref name="national-energy-efficiency-action-plans"/&gt; Some national action plans have Wikipedia articles as well:

* [[German National Action Plan on Energy Efficiency]]

== Reception and effectiveness ==

A 2014 study finds that, despite the directive being technically complex and lacking binding targets, it is an improvement over earlier European Union policy on energy efficiency.  Notwithstanding, the document is weakened by the number of exemptions and the number of passages it contains requiring interpretation.  The process of implementation is also subject to problems.&lt;ref name="zgajewski-2014"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|3–4}}

A 2016 study examines the treatment of article{{nbsp}}7 of the directive{{nnbsp}}&lt;ref name="directive-2012-27-ec"/&gt;{{rp|15}} by each of the 28 member states.  Titled ''Energy efficiency obligation schemes'', this key article requires that countries "implement energy efficiency obligations and/or alternative policy instruments in order to reach a reduction in final energy use of 1.5% per year".&lt;ref name="rosenow-etal-2016"/&gt;{{rp|1}}  To fulfill this requirement, the member states have proposed very different policy measures and adopted very different calculation methods and monitoring and verification schemes.  The study analyses each national action plan and estimates whether the projected savings are likely to materialise and whether these will be sufficient to meet the article{{nbsp}}7 target.&lt;ref name="rosenow-etal-2016"&gt;

'''Ekachakra''' is a small village, located 20&amp;nbsp;km away from the town of [[Rampurhat]] in the [[Birbhum District]] of [[West Bengal]].&lt;ref name="vedabase.net"&gt;[http://vedabase.net/cc/adi/13/61/en1 Chaitanya Charitamrita Adi-lila,13.61, purport]&lt;/ref&gt; Within [[Hinduism|Hindu]] tradition, the five [[Pandavas]] from the epic, [[Mahabharata]] are described as staying in Ekachakra during their years in exile.&lt;ref name= omalley&gt;O’Malley, L.S.S., ICS, ''Birbhum'', Bengal District Gazetteers, p. 128, first published 1910, 1996 reprint, Government of West Bengal&lt;/ref&gt;  It is also famous as the birthplace of [[Nityananda|Nityananda Rama]]&lt;ref name="vedabase.net"/&gt; (b 1474 CE), a principal religious figure in the [[Gaudiya Vaishnava]] tradition.

The village extends north and south for an area of about eight miles. Other villages, namely Viracandra-pura and Virabhadra-pura, are situated within the area of the village of Ekacakra. In honor of [[Virachandra Goswami]] (the son of Nityananda), these places are renowned as Viracandra-pura and Virabhadra-pura.

==Toponym==
The origin of the name Ekachakra is associated with the legend of the [[Pandavas]]. In the battle of Kurukshetra when [[Krishna]] broke his vow of not taking any sides in the war to save his devotee [[Arjuna]], he has rushed with a wheel to hit Bhishmadeva who had been fighting with Arjuna. When Bhishmadeva satisfied him with many beautiful prayers, Krishna lost his anger and tossed aside the wheel. The wheel fell on this tract of land and therefore got the name ''Ekachakra''. ''Eka'' means one, and ''chakra'' means wheel.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

In the [[Mahabharata]], it is also believed to be the place where Demon [[Bakasura]] lived who was later slain by [[Bhima]]. However, there are several places all over India which contest as ancient Ekachakra.

==Garbhavasa==
This is said to be the actual birthplace of [[Nityananda]].{{citation needed|date=January 2011}} In the Janmasthan [[Mandir]] there is a deity of Nitai (Nityananda) worshipped by a local [[brahmin]] family. Hadai Pandita Bhavan is the site of the original house of Nityananda’s father. The small white temple next to Nitai Kund marks the exact spot where Nityananda was born. There are two [[banyan]] trees by this temple that are said to have existed since the time of Nityananda.

In the center of the main altar of the temple is a [[deity]] of Lord Nityananda. To his left, with his hands raised, is [[Chaitanya Mahaprabhu]]. On Nityananda’s right is [[Advaita Acharya]]. The side altar has deities of [[Radha]]-Radhakanta and Radha-Srikanta, a large dancing [[Gouranga]] in the center, and ten brass sakhis at the bottom. The temple was constructed by Prasannakumara Karapharma.

==Mala Tala==
There is an old [[Sacred fig|Pippala]] tree here called 'Mala Tala'. Just before Nityananda departed the village in his youth, Hadai Pandita came here and chanted [[japa]] under this tree. Mala means "[[japa mala|japa beads]]" and tala means "tree." When Nitai was about to depart Hadai Pandita left his japa beads here due to anxiety.

Chaitanya Mahaprabhu came to Ekacakra many years after Nityananda left. It is said that at that time Chaitanya left his flower [[garland]] on a branch of this tree. Mala also means "garland." Therefore, also for this reason this tree was called Mala Tala.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

==Hantugada Tirtha==
(Also known as Jahnu Kund) It is said that Nitai brought all the sacred waters from all the holy places to this [[temple tank|kunda]] to save the local residents from having to journey to the [[Ganges]] to take a sacred bath. It is named Hantugada because Nityananda Prabhu used to perform the Dadhi-cida festival of distributing chipped rice with yogurt [[prasadam]] here and He would take the prasada while kneeling down.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

==Pandava Tala==
This place is a five-minute walk (400m) into the fields, southeast of Nityananda’s birthplace. It is surrounded by a group of Keli-[[kadamba tree]]s. The [[Pandavas]] are said to have lived here with their mother, [[Kunti]], when they were exiled to the forest.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

==Bankima Raya Mandira==
The current [[deity]] within the Bankima Raya temple was found by Nityananda himself, within the Yamuna river of Ekachakra.
The deity was then installed in a temple that is now submerged within Jahnu kunda.
Nityananda is believed to have merged within this deity at the time of his disappearance.
The present temple of Bankima Raya is also an old one.
The deity of Jahnava Mata (Nityananda's wife) was placed beside him.
In this temple there is also a small samadhi of [[Virachandra Goswami]].

'''Energetics''' (also called '''energy economics''') is the study of energy under [[energy transformation|transformation]]. Because energy flows at all scales, from the [[quantum physics|quantum]] level to the [[biosphere]] and [[cosmos]], energetics is a very broad discipline, encompassing for example [[thermodynamics]], [[chemistry]], [[Biological thermodynamics|biological energetics]], [[biochemistry]] and [[ecological energetics]]. Where each branch of energetics begins and ends is a topic of constant debate. For example, Lehninger (1973, p.&amp;nbsp;21) contended that when the science of thermodynamics deals with energy exchanges of all types, it can be called energetics.

==Aims==
In general, energetics is concerned with defining relationships to describe the tendencies of [[energy transfer|energy flows]] and [[energy storage|storages]] under transformation, defined here as phenomena which behave like historical invariants under repeated observations. When some critical number of people have observed such invariance, such a principle is usually then given the status of a '[[Physical law|fundamental law]]' of science. As in all scientific inquiry, whether a theorem or principle is considered a fundamental law appears to depend on how many people agree to the proposition. The ultimate aim of energetics therefore is the description of fundamental laws. Philosophers of science have held that the fundamental [[laws of thermodynamics]] can be treated as laws of energetics, (Reiser 1926, p.&amp;nbsp;432). By continuing to more accurately describe these laws, energetics aims to produce reliable predictions about energy flow and storage transformations at any scale.

==History==
Energetics has a controversial history. Some authors maintain that the its origins may be found in the work of the ancient Greeks, but that the mathematical formalisation began with the work of [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]]. [[Richard de Villamil]] (1928) said that [[William John Macquorn Rankine|Rankine]] formulated the science of energetics in his paper ''Outlines of the Science of Energetics'' published in the Proceedings of the Philosophical Society of Glasgow in 1855. W. Ostwald and E. Mach subsequently developed the study, and by the late 1800s energetics was understood to be incompatible with the atomic view of the atom forwarded by [[Ludwig Boltzmann|Boltzmann]]'s gas theory. Proof of the atom settled the dispute but not without significant damage. In the 1920s [[Lotka]] attempted to build on Boltzmann's views through a mathematical synthesis of energetics with biological evolutionary theory. Lotka proposed that the selective principle of evolution was one which favoured the maximum useful energy flow transformation. This view subsequently influenced the further development of ecological energetics, especially the work of [[Howard T. Odum]].

De Villamil attempted to clarify the scope of energetics with respect to other branches of physics by positing a system that divides [[mechanics]] into two branches; energetics (the science of [[energy]]), and "pure", "abstract" or "rigid" [[dynamics (mechanics)|dynamics]] (the science of [[momentum]]). According to Villamil energetics can be mathematically characterised by scalar equations, and rigid dynamics by vector equations. In this division the dimensions for dynamics are ''space'', time and mass, and for energetics, ''length'', time and mass (Villamil 1928, p.&amp;nbsp;9). This division is made according to fundamental suppositions about the properties of bodies, e.g.:

# Are the particles comprising the system rigidly fixed together?
# Is there any machinery for stopping moving bodies?

In Villamil's classification system, dynamics says yes to 1 and no to 2, whereas energetics says no to 1 and yes to 2. Therefore, in Villamil's system, dynamics assumes that particles are rigidly fixed together and cannot vibrate, and consequently must all be at zero kelvin. The [[conservation of momentum]] is a consequence of this view, however it is considered valid only in logic and not to be a true representation of the facts (Villamil, p.&amp;nbsp;96). In contrast energetics does not assume that particles are rigidly fixed together, and thus are free to vibrate, and consequently can be at non-zero temperatures.

==Theories==
[[Image:Genomics GTL Program Payoffs.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Ecological analysis of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in an [[ecosystem]]]]
As a general statement of energy flows under transformation, the principles of energetics include the first four [[laws of thermodynamics]] which seek a rigorous description. However the precise place of the laws of thermodynamics within the principles of energetics is a topic currently under debate. If the ecologist [[Howard T. Odum]] was right, the principles of energetics take into consideration a hierarchical ordering of energy forms, which aims to account for the concept of [[energy quality]], and the evolution of the universe. [[Albert Lehninger]] (1973, p.&amp;nbsp;2) called these hierarchical orderings the

{{quote|... successive stages in the flow of energy through the biological macrocosm}}

Odum proposed 3 further energetic principles and one corollary that take [[Energy quality#Ranking_energy_quality|energy hierarchy]] into account. The first four principles of energetics are related to the same numbered laws of [[thermodynamics]], and are expanded upon in that article.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11831">The environmental benefits of [[renewable energy]] technologies are widely recognised, but the contribution that they can make to [[energy security]] is less well known. Renewable technologies can enhance energy security in [[electricity generation]], heat supply, and [[transportation]].&lt;ref name=IEA&gt;[http://www.iea.org/publications/freepublications/publication/so_contribution.pdf Contribution of Renewables to Energy Security]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Energy security==
Access to cheap energy has become essential to the functioning of modern economies. However, the uneven distribution of [[fossil fuel]] supplies among countries, and the critical need to widely access energy resources, has led to significant vulnerabilities. Threats to global [[energy security]] include political instability of energy producing countries, manipulation of energy supplies, competition over energy sources, attacks on supply infrastructure, as well as accidents and [[natural disaster]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aspi.org.au/publications/publication_details.aspx?ContentID=142&amp;pubtype=5  Power plays: Energy and Australia's security] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100811072715/http://www.aspi.org.au/publications/publication_details.aspx?ContentID=142&amp;pubtype=5 |date=2010-08-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Energy security, therefore, has become fundamental from many perspectives, and is being therefore increasingly at the centre of legal and policy issues linked to social, economic, and development matters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Farah|first1=Paolo Davide|last2=Rossi|first2=Piercarlo|title=Energy: Policy, Legal and Social-Economic Issues Under the Dimensions of Sustainability and Security|journal=World Scientific Reference on Globalisation in Eurasia and the Pacific Rim|date=2015|ssrn=2695701|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Fukushima I nuclear accidents]] in Japan have brought new attention to how national energy systems are vulnerable to natural disasters, with climate change already bringing more weather and climate extremes. These threats to our old energy systems provide a rationale for investing in renewable energy. Shifting to renewable energy "can help us to meet the dual goals of reducing greenhouse gas emissions, thereby limiting future extreme weather and climate impacts, and ensuring reliable, timely, and cost-efficient delivery of energy". Investing in renewable energy can have significant dividends for our energy security.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/rea/news/article/2011/04/yet-another-reason-to-choose-renewable-energy |title=Climate Risk: Yet Another Reason to Choose Renewable Energy |author=Amanda Staudt |date=20 April 2011  |work=Renewable Energy World }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transportation==

The [[International Energy Agency]]'s ''World Energy Outlook 2006'' concludes that rising petroleum demand, if left unchecked, would accentuate vulnerability to a severe supply disruption and resulting sudden price increases, in consuming countries. Renewable biofuels for transport represent a key source of diversification from [[petroleum products]]. Biofuels from grain and beet in [[temperate region]]s have a role, but they are relatively expensive and their energy efficiency and carbon dioxide savings, vary. Biofuels from sugar cane and other highly productive tropical crops are much more competitive and beneficial. But all first generation biofuels ultimately compete with the production of food for land, water, and other resources. More effort is required to develop and commercialize second generation biofuel technologies, such as biorefineries and [[cellulosic ethanol]], enabling the flexible production of biofuels and related products from non-edible parts of the plant.&lt;ref name=IEA /&gt;

According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), [[cellulosic ethanol commercialization]] could allow [[ethanol fuel]]s to play a much larger role in the future than previously thought.&lt;ref&gt;International Energy Agency (2006). [http://www.worldenergyoutlook.org/summaries2006/English.pdf ''World Energy Outlook 2006''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928041451/http://www.worldenergyoutlook.org/summaries2006/English.pdf |date=September 28, 2007 }} p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; Cellulosic ethanol can be made from plant matter composed primarily of inedible cellulose fibers that form the stems and branches of most plants. Dedicated [[energy crop]]s, such as switchgrass, are also promising cellulose sources that can be produced in many regions of the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Biotechnology Industry Organization (2007). [https://web.archive.org/web/20060212025744/http://www.bio.org/ind/biofuel/CellulosicEthanolIssueBrief.pdf ''Industrial Biotechnology Is Revolutionizing the Production of Ethanol Transportation Fuel''] pp. 3-4.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Heating==

In those countries where growing dependence on imported gas is a pressing energy security issue, renewable energy technologies can provide alternative sources of electric power production as well as displacing electricity demand through production of direct heat.  The IEA suggests that the direct contribution that renewable energy can make to domestic or commercial [[space heating]] and industrial process heat should be examined more closely. Heat from solar, geothermal sources, and [[heat pump]]s, is increasingly economic but is often overlooked in government programmes that promote public acceptance and provide incentives for renewable electricity and [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]].&lt;ref name=IEA /&gt;

[[Solar heating]] systems are a well known technology and generally consist of solar thermal collectors, a fluid system to move the heat from the collector to its point of usage, and a reservoir or tank for heat storage. The systems may be used to heat domestic hot water, swimming pools, or homes and businesses.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rmi.org/sitepages/pid705.php Solar water heating] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070220210911/http://www.rmi.org/sitepages/pid705.php |date=2007-02-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The heat can also be used for industrial process applications or as an energy input for other uses such as cooling equipment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iea-shc.org/task25/index.html Solar assisted air-conditioning of buildings] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121105091415/http://www.iea-shc.org/task25/index.html |date=November 5, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In many warmer climates, a solar heating system can provide a very high percentage (50 to 75%) of domestic hot water energy.

==Electricity generation==
As the electricity grid becomes increasingly vulnerable to faults from equipment failure, willful attack or even sunspot activity, the risk of a major national scale grid failure is rising. The deployment of renewable technologies usually increases the diversity of electricity sources and, through local generation, contributes to the flexibility of the system and its resistance to central shocks. The IEA suggests that attention in this area has focused too much on the issue of the [[Variable renewable energy|variability]] of renewable electricity production.&lt;ref name=IEA /&gt; However, this only applies to certain renewable technologies, mainly [[wind power]] and [[solar photovoltaics]], and its significance depends on a range of factors which include the market penetration of the renewables concerned, the balance of plant and the wider connectivity of the system, as well as the demand side flexibility. Variability will rarely be a barrier to increased renewable energy deployment. But at high levels of market penetration it requires careful analysis and management, and additional costs may be required for back-up or system modification.&lt;ref name=IEA /&gt;

Renewable electricity supply in the 20-50+% penetration range has already been implemented in several European systems, albeit in the context of an integrated European grid system:&lt;ref name=Lovins11&gt;[[Amory Lovins]] (2011). ''[[Reinventing Fire]]'', Chelsea Green Publishing, p. 199.&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
In 2010, four German states, totaling 10 million people, relied on wind power for 43-52% of their annual electricity needs. Denmark isn't far behind, supplying 22% of its power from wind in 2010 (26% in an average wind year). The Extremadura region of Spain is getting up to 25% of its electricity from solar, while the whole country meets 16% of its demand from wind. Just during 2005-2010, Portugal vaulted from 17% to 45% renewable electricity.&lt;ref name=Lovins11/&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Minnkota Power Cooperative, the leading U.S. wind utility in 2009, supplied 38% of its retail sales from the wind.&lt;ref name=Lovins11/&gt;

Physicist [[Amory Lovins]] has said that following hundreds of blackouts in 2005, Cuba reorganized its electricity transmission system into networked microgrids and cut the occurrence of blackouts to zero within two years, limiting damage even after two hurricanes.&lt;ref name=al12/&gt; Networked island-able microgrids describes Lovins’ vision where energy is generated locally from [[solar power]], [[wind power]] and other resources and used by super-efficient buildings. When each building, or neighborhood, is generating its own power, with links to other “islands” of power, the security of the entire network is greatly enhanced.&lt;ref name=al12&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.greenbiz.com/blog/2012/03/16/amory-lovins-reinventing-fire-convergence-and-innovation?page=full |title=Amory Lovins on 'Reinventing Fire' with convergence and innovation |author=Adam Aston |date=March 16, 2012  |work=Greenbiz }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Combined Power Plant==
The Combined Power Plant, a project linking 36 wind, solar, biomass, and hydroelectric installations throughout Germany, has demonstrated that a combination of renewable sources and more-effective control can balance out short-term power fluctuations and provide reliable electricity with 100 percent renewable energy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldwatch.org/files/pdf/SOW09_chap4.pdf An Enduring Energy Future] p. 139.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kombikraftwerk.de/index.php?id=27 The Combined Power Plant]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact of Foreign Investor Dispute Rights==
It has been argued that investor-state dispute settlement rights may grant investors in carbon-intensive industries a mechanism to inhibit government policies promoting renewable energy technologies.&lt;ref&gt;Faunce TA. Will a new government hand control of our energy to overseas investors. The Conversation August 6, 2013 https://theconversation.com/will-a-new-government-hand-control-of-our-energy-to-overseas-investors-15383 (accessed 6 August 2013)&lt;/ref&gt; The impact of dispute settlement through international arbitration or negotiation, however, is also deemed to be a useful tool to foster investment in [[sustainable energy]] and tackle connected issues linked to security, environmental threats, and sustainable development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Farah|first1=Paolo Davide|title=Sustainable Energy Investments and National Security: Arbitration and Negotiation Issues|journal=JOURNAL OF WORLD ENERGY LAW AND BUSINESS|date=2015|volume=8|issue=6|ssrn=2695579|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Gilgamesh flood myth''' is a [[flood myth]] in the ''[[Epic of Gilgamesh]]''. Many scholars believe that the flood myth was added to Tablet XI in the "standard version" of the Gilgamesh Epic by an editor who utilized the flood story from the [[Atra-Hasis|Epic of Atrahasis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Tigay|1982}}&lt;/ref&gt; A short reference to the flood myth is also present in the much older Sumerian Gilgamesh poems, from which the later Babylonian versions drew much of their inspiration and subject matter.

== History ==
[[Gilgamesh]]’s supposed historical reign is believed to have been approximately [[2700 BCE]],&lt;ref&gt;Georges Roux, ''Ancient Iraq'', pages 123, 502&lt;/ref&gt; shortly before the earliest known written stories. The discovery of artifacts associated with [[Aga of Kish|Aga]] and [[Enmebaragesi]] of [[Kish (Sumer)|Kish]], two other kings named in the stories, has lent credibility to the historical existence of Gilgamesh.&lt;ref&gt;[[Stephanie Dalley|Dalley, Stephanie]], ''Myths from Mesopotamia'', Oxford University Press (1989), p. 40–41&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest [[Sumer]]ian Gilgamesh poems date from as early as the [[Third dynasty of Ur]] (2100–2000 BCE).&lt;ref&gt;Andrew George, page xix&lt;/ref&gt; One of these poems mentions Gilgamesh’s journey to meet the flood hero, as well as a short version of the flood story.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://etcsl.orinst.ox.ac.uk/cgi-bin/etcsl.cgi?text=t.1.8.1.3# |title=The Electronic Text Corpus of Sumerian Literature; The death of Gilgameš (three versions, translated)}}&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] versions of the unified epic are dated to ca. 2000–[[1500 BCE]].&lt;ref&gt;Andrew George, page 101, “Early Second Millennium BCE” in Old Babylonian&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the fragmentary nature of these Old Babylonian versions, it is unclear whether they included an expanded account of the flood myth; although one fragment definitely includes the story of Gilgamesh’s journey to meet [[Utnapishtim]]. The “standard” Akkadian version included a long version of the story and was edited by [[Sin-liqe-unninni]] sometime between 1300 and 1000 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew George, pages xxiv–xxv&lt;/ref&gt;

== Tablet XI ==
{{main|Utnapishtim}}
The Gilgamesh flood tablet XI contains additional story material besides the flood. The flood story was included because in it the flood hero Utnapishtim is granted [[immortality]] by the gods and that fits the immortality theme of the epic. The main point seems to be that Utnapishtim was granted eternal life in unique, never-to-be-repeated circumstances. As if to demonstrate this point, Utnapishtim challenges Gilgamesh to stay awake for six days and seven nights. However, as soon as Utnapishtim finishes speaking Gilgamesh falls asleep. Utnapishtim instructs his wife to bake a loaf of bread for every day he is asleep so that Gilgamesh cannot deny his failure. Gilgamesh, who wants to overcome death, cannot even conquer sleep.

As Gilgamesh is leaving, Utnapishtim's wife asks her husband to offer a parting gift. Utnapishtim tells Gilgamesh of a [[boxthorn]]-like plant at the very bottom of the ocean that will make him young again. Gilgamesh obtains the plant by binding stones to his feet so he can walk on the bottom of the sea. He recovers the plant and plans to test it on an old man when he returns to Uruk. Unfortunately, when Gilgamesh stops to bathe it is stolen by a [[serpent (symbolism)|serpent]] that sheds its skin as it departs, apparently reborn. Gilgamesh, having failed both chances, returns to Uruk, where the sight of its massive walls provokes him to praise this enduring work of mortal men. The implication may be that mortals can achieve immortality through lasting works of civilization and culture.

==Flood myth section==
Lines 1-203, Tablet XI &lt;ref&gt;Kovacs, ''The Epic of Gilgamesh'', Tablet XI, p. 95-103. (Lines 1-203)&lt;/ref&gt; (note: with ''supplemental sub-titles and line numbers added for clarity'')

===Ea leaks the secret plan===
#Utnapishtim tells Gilgamesh a secret story that begins in the old city of Shuruppak on the banks of the Euphrates River.
#The "great gods" Anu, Enlil, Ninurta, Ennugi, and Ea were sworn to secrecy about their plan to cause the flood.
#But the god Ea (Sumerian god Enki) repeated the plan to Utnapishtim through a reed wall in a reed house.
#Ea commanded Utnapishtim to demolish his house and build a boat, regardless of the cost, to keep living beings alive.
#The boat must have equal dimensions with corresponding width and length and be covered over like Apsu boats.
#Utnapishtim promised to do what Ea commanded.
#He asked Ea what he should say to the city elders and the population.
#Ea tells him to say that Enlil has rejected him and he can no longer reside in the city or set foot in Enlil's territory.
#He should also say that he will go down to the Apsu "to live with my lord Ea". 
#Note: 'Apsu' can refer to a fresh water marsh near the temple of Ea/Enki at the city of Eridu.&lt;ref&gt;"Literary tradition depicts Eridu as a city of the marshes and tells of a large body of fresh water, the Abzu, in the immediate vicinity of Eridu." ''Eridu in Sumerian Literature'', Margaret Whitney Green, PhD dissertation, University of Chicago, August 1975, page 6.&lt;/ref&gt;
#Ea will provide abundant rain, a profusion of fowl and fish, and a wealthy harvest of wheat and bread.

===Building and launching the boat===
#Carpenters, reed workers, and other people assembled one morning. 
#[missing lines]
#Five days later, Utnapishtim laid out the exterior walls of the boat of 120 [[cubit]]s.
#The sides of the superstructure had equal lengths of 120 cubits. He also made a drawing of the interior structure.
#The boat had six decks [?] divided into seven and nine compartments. 
#Water plugs were driven into the middle part.
#Punting poles and other necessary things were laid in.
#Three times 3,600 units of raw bitumen were melted in a kiln and three times 3,600 units of oil were used in addition to two times 3,600 units of oil that were stored in the boat.
#Oxen and sheep were slaughtered and ale, beer, oil, and wine were distributed to the workmen, like at a new year's festival.
#When the boat was finished, the launching was very difficult. A runway of poles was used to slide the boat into the water.
#Two-thirds of the boat was in the water.
#Utnapishtim loaded his silver and gold into the boat.
#He loaded "all the living beings that I had."
#His relatives and craftsmen, and "all the beasts and animals of the field" boarded the boat.
#The time arrived, as stated by the god Shamash, to seal the entry door.

===The storm===
#Early in the morning at dawn a black cloud arose from the horizon.
#The weather was frightful.
#Utnapishtim boarded the boat and entrusted the boat and its contents to his boatmaster Puzurammurri who sealed the entry.
#The thunder god Adad rumbled in the cloud and storm gods Shullar and Hanish went over mountains and land.
#Erragal pulled out the mooring poles and the dikes overflowed.
#The Annunnaki gods lit up the land with their lightning.
#There was stunned shock at Adad's deeds which turned everything to blackness. The land was shattered like a pot.
#All day long the south wind blew rapidly and the water overwhelmed the people like an attack.
#No one could see his fellows. They could not recognize each other in the torrent.
#The gods were frightened by the flood, and retreated up to the Anu heaven. They cowered like dogs lying by the outer wall.
#Ishtar shrieked like a woman in childbirth.
#The Mistress of the gods wailed that the old days had turned to clay because "I said evil things in the Assembly of the Gods, ordering a catastrophe to destroy my people who fill the sea like fish."
#The other gods were weeping with her and sat sobbing with grief, their lips burning, parched with thirst.
#The flood and wind lasted six days and six nights, flattening the land.
#On the seventh day, the storm was pounding [intermittently?] like a woman in labor.

===Calm after the storm===
#The sea calmed and the whirlwind and flood stopped. All day long there was quiet. All humans had turned to clay.
#The terrain was as flat as a roof top. Utnapishtim opened a window and felt fresh air on his face.
#He fell to his knees and sat weeping, tears streaming down his face. He looked for coastlines at the horizon and saw a region of land.
#The boat lodged firmly on mount Nimush which held the boat for several days, allowing no swaying.
#On the seventh day he released a dove which flew away, but came back to him. He released a swallow, but it also came back to him.
#He released a raven which was able to eat and scratch, and did not circle back to the boat.
#He then sent his livestock out in various directions.

===The sacrifice===
#He sacrificed a sheep and offered incense at a mountainous ziggurat where he placed 14 sacrificial vessels and poured reeds, cedar, and myrtle into the fire. 
#The gods smelled the sweet odor of the sacrificial animal and gathered like flies over the sacrifice.
#Then the great goddess arrived, lifted up her flies (beads), and said 
#"Ye gods, as surely as I shall not forget this lapis lazuli [amulet] around my neck, I shall be mindful of these days and never forget them! The gods may come to the sacrificial offering. But Enlil may not come, because he brought about the flood and annihilated my people without considering [the consequences]." 
#When Enlil arrived, he saw the boat and became furious at the Igigi gods. He said "Where did a living being escape? No man was to survive the annihilation!"
#Ninurta spoke to Enlil saying "Who else but Ea could do such a thing? It is Ea who knew all of our plans."
#Ea spoke to Enlil saying "It was you, the Sage of the Gods. How could ''you'' bring about a flood without consideration?"
#Ea then accuses Enlil of sending a disproportionate punishment, and reminds him of the need for compassion. 
#Ea denies leaking the god's secret plan to Atrahasis (= Utnapishtim), admitting only sending him a dream and deflecting Enlil's attention to the flood hero.

===The flood hero and his wife are granted immortality and transported far away===
#He then boards a boat and grasping Utnapishtim's hand, helps him and his wife aboard where they kneel. Standing between Utnapishtim and his wife, he touches their foreheads and blesses them. "Formerly Utnapishtim was a human being, but now he and his wife have become gods like us. Let Utnapishtim reside far away, at the mouth of the rivers."
#Utnapishtim and his wife are transported and settled at the "mouth of the rivers".

==Material altered or omitted==
The Epic of Atrahasis provides additional information on the flood and flood hero that is omitted in Gilgamesh XI and other versions of the Ancient Near East flood myth. According to Atrahasis III ii, lines 40–47 the flood hero was at a banquet when the storm and flood began: "He invited his people&amp;nbsp;... to a banquet&amp;nbsp;... He sent his family on board. They ate and they drank. But he (Atrahasis) was in and out. He could not sit, could not crouch, for his heart was broken and he was vomiting gall."&lt;ref&gt;Lambert &amp; Millard, page 93&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Tigay, Atrahasis tablet III iv, lines 6–9 clearly identify the flood as a local river flood: "Like dragonflies they [dead bodies] have filled the river. Like a raft they have moved in to the edge [of the boat]. Like a raft they have moved in to the riverbank." The sentence "Like dragonflies they have filled the river." was changed in Gilgamesh XI line 123 to "Like the spawn of fishes, they fill the sea."&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Tigay|1982|pp=220, 225}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tigay holds that we can see the mythmaker's hand at work here, changing a local river flood into an ocean deluge.

Most other authorities interpret the Atrahasis flood as universal. A. R. George, and Lambert and Millard make it clear that the gods' intention in Atrahasis is to "wipe out mankind".&lt;ref&gt;Andrew George, p. xliv.; Lambert and Millard p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; The flood destroys "all of the earth".&lt;ref&gt;Frymer-Kensky, Tikva Simone (2006), ''Studies in Bible and feminist criticism'', Philadelphia: Jewish Publication Society. p. 354&lt;/ref&gt; The use of a comparable metaphor in the Gilgamesh epic suggests that the reference to "dragonflies [filling] the river" is simply an evocative image of death rather than a literal description of the flood&lt;ref&gt;George, Andrew (2003), ''The Babylonian Gilgamesh epic: introduction, critical edition and cuneiform texts'', New York: Oxford University Press, pp. 506, 875-876. Apparently, the appearance of large numbers of drowned dragonflies—or mayflies according to George—was a common phenomenon associated with Mesopotamian river floods.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the local river flood in Atrahasis could accomplish destruction of all "mankind" and "all of the earth" if the scope of "mankind" is limited to all of the people living on "all of the land" of the flood plains in the lower river valley known to the Atrahasis writer.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

Other editorial changes were made to the Atrahasis text in Gilgamesh to lessen the suggestion that the gods may have experienced human needs. For example, Atrahasis OB III, 30–31 "The Anunnaki, the great gods [were sitt]ing in thirst and hunger" was changed in Gilgamesh XI, line 113 to "The gods feared the deluge." Sentences in Atrahasis III iv were omitted in Gilgamesh, e.g. "She was surfeited with grief and thirsted for beer" and "From hunger they were suffering cramp."&lt;ref name="Tigay, page 226"&gt;{{harv|Tigay|1982|p=226}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These and other editorial changes to Atrahasis are documented and described in the book by Prof. Tigay (see below) who is associate professor of Hebrew and Semitic languages and literature in the University of Pennsylvania. Prof. Tigay comments: "The dropping of individual lines between others which are preserved, but are not synonymous with them, appears to be a more deliberate editorial act. These lines share a common theme, the hunger and thirst of the gods during the flood."&lt;ref name="Tigay, page 226"/&gt;

Although the 18th century BC copy of the Atrahasis (Atra-Hasis) epic post-dates the early Gilgamesh epic, we do not know whether the Old-Akkadian Gilgamesh tablets included the flood story, because of the fragmentary nature of surviving tablets. Some scholars argue that they did not.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Tigay|1982|p=244}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tigay, for example, maintains that three major additions to the Gilgamesh epic, namely the prologue, the flood story (tablet XI), and tablet XII, were added by an editor or editors, possibly by Sin-leqi-unninni, to whom the entire epic was later attributed. According to this view, the flood story in tablet XI was based on a late version of the Atrahasis story.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Tigay|1982|p=245}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alternative translations==
As with most translations, especially from an ancient, dead language, scholars differ on the meaning of ambiguous sentences.

For example, line 57 in Gilgamesh XI is usually translated (with reference to the boat) "ten rods the height of her sides",&lt;ref&gt;Andrew George, page 90&lt;/ref&gt; or "its walls were each 10 times 12 cubits in height".&lt;ref&gt;Kovacs, page 99&lt;/ref&gt; A rod was a dozen cubits, and a Sumerian cubit was about 20 inches. Hence these translations imply that the boat was about 200 feet high, which would be impractical&lt;ref&gt;''Ships and Seafaring in Ancient Times'', Lionel Casson, page 86.&lt;/ref&gt; with the technology in Gilgamesh's time (about 2700 BC).&lt;ref&gt;''Ancient Iraq'', Georges Roux, page 502 Table II&lt;/ref&gt; There is no Akkadian word for "height" in line 57. The sentence literally reads "Ten dozen-cubits each I-raised its-walls."&lt;ref&gt;Parpola, page 109&lt;/ref&gt; A similar example from an unrelated house building tablet reads: "he shall build the wall [of the house] and raise it four ninda and two cubits." This measurement (about 83 feet) means wall length not height.&lt;ref&gt;''The Assyrian Dictionary'', John Brinkman et al. (editors), University of Chicago, 1980, vol. I–J under igaru, page 36.&lt;/ref&gt;

Line 142 in Gilgamesh XI is usually translated "Mount Niṣir held the boat, allowing no motion." Niṣir is often spelled ''Nimush'',&lt;ref&gt;Rene Labat, ''Manuel D'Épigraphie Akkadienne'', 1988, sign 374.&lt;/ref&gt; which is described as the newer reading.&lt;ref name="AitkenDellMastin2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Day, John|editors=James K. Aitken, Katharine Julia Dell, and Brian A. Mastin|title=The Flood and the Ten Antediluvian Figures|work=On Stone and Scroll: Essays in Honour of Graham Ivor Davies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-WBYsiLkGosC&amp;pg=PA213|year=2011|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|isbn=978-3-11-022805-2|page=213}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Akkadian words translated "Mount Niṣir" are "KUR-ú KUR ni-ṣir".&lt;ref&gt;Parpola, page 111, line 142&lt;/ref&gt; The word KUR could mean hill or country; it is capitalized because it is a Sumerian word.&lt;ref&gt;''The Assyrian Dictionary'', Brinkman et al. (editors), vol. Š part 1, pages 58–59 under šadú.&lt;/ref&gt; The first KUR is followed by a [[phonetic complement]] ''-ú'' which indicates that KUR-ú is to be read in Akkadian as ''šadú'' (hill) and not as ''mātu'' (country). Since ''šadú'' (hill) could also mean ''mountain'' in Akkadian, and scholars knew the Biblical expression ''Mount Ararat'', it has become customary to translate ''šadú'' as ''mountain'' or ''mount''. The flood hero was Sumerian, according to the WB-62 [[Sumerian King List]],&lt;ref&gt;S. Langdon, "The Chaldean Kings Before the Flood", ''Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 1923, pages 251–259.&lt;/ref&gt; and in Sumerian the word KUR meant ''hill'' or ''country'', not ''mountain''. The second KUR lacks a phonetic complement and is therefore read in Akkadian as ''mātu'' (country). Hence, the entire clause reads "The hill/mound country niṣir held the boat".

Lines 146-147 in Gilgamesh XI are usually translated "I&amp;nbsp;... made sacrifice, incense I placed on the peak of the mountain."&lt;ref&gt;Andrew George, page 94&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly "I poured out a libation on the peak of the mountain."&lt;ref&gt;Heidel page 87&lt;/ref&gt; But Kovacs&lt;ref&gt;Kovacs, page 102, at 12th line from the top.&lt;/ref&gt; provides this translation of line 156: "I offered incense in front of the mountain-ziggurat." Parpola provides the original Akkadian for this sentence: "áš-kun sur-qin-nu [[aš (cuneiform)|ina]] UGU ziq-qur-rat KUR-i"&lt;ref&gt;Parpola, page 111&lt;/ref&gt; Áš-kun means I-placed; sur-qin-nu means offering; ina-(the preposition) means on-(upon); UGU means top-of; [[ziggurat|ziq-qur-rat]] means temple tower; and KUR-i means hilly. Parpola's glossary (page 145) defines ziq-qur-rat as "temple tower, ziggurat" and refers to line 157 so he translates ziq-qur-rat as temple tower in this context. The sentence literally reads "I placed an offering on top of a hilly ziggurat." A ziggurat was an elevated platform or temple tower where priests made offerings to the temple god. Most translators of line 157 disregard ziq-qur-rat as a redundant metaphor for peak. There is no authority for this other than previous translations of line 157.&lt;ref&gt;''The Assyrian Dictionary'', Brinkman et al. (editors), vol. Z, page 131.&lt;/ref&gt; Kovacs' translation retains the word ziggurat on page 102.

One of the Sumerian cities with a ziggurat was [[Eridu]] located on the southern branch of the Euphrates River next to a large swampy low-lying depression known as the [[apsû]].&lt;ref&gt;''Eridu in Sumerian Literature'', Margaret Whitney Green, pages 8, 169.&lt;/ref&gt; The only ziggurat at Eridu was at the temple of the god Ea (Enki), known as the apsû-house.&lt;ref&gt;Green, pages 201–202&lt;/ref&gt; In Gilgamesh XI, line 42 the flood hero said "I will go down [the river] to the apsû to live with Ea, my Lord."&lt;ref&gt;Green, page 98, at 21st line from top.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lines 189–192 (lines 198–201) in Gilgamesh XI are usually translated "Then &lt;sup&gt;god&lt;/sup&gt;Enlil came aboard the boat. He took hold of my hand and brought me on board. He brought aboard my wife and made her kneel at my side. Standing between us, he touched our foreheads to bless us."&lt;ref&gt;Andrew George, page 95.&lt;/ref&gt; In the first sentence "Then dingir-kabtu came aboard the boat" the Akkadian determinative [[dingir]] is usually translated as "god", but can also mean "priest"&lt;ref&gt;Margaret Whitney Green, ''Eridu in Sumerian Literature'', PhD dissertation, University of Chicago (1975), p. 224.&lt;/ref&gt; Dingir-kabtu literally means "divine important-person".&lt;ref&gt;Parpola, page 128&lt;/ref&gt; Translating this as Enlil is the translator's conjecture.

Global HealthShare® initiative (GHS) is a program launched in June 2010 by the [[University of California, Davis]] Center of Excellence for [[Nutritional genomics|Nutritional Genomics]]. The program plans to share resources to improve the health in [[developing countries]]. Alliances with other research institutions, humanitarian organizations and private companies around the world have been made to meet this goal.

The organization will use a multidisciplinary approach against [[Chronic (medicine)|chronic]] and [[Infectious disease|infectious]] disease, breaking down their efforts into two main research "cores": the Nutrition Core and Mucosal Immunity Core. The former focuses on fighting [[malnutrition]] and the latter on developing new ways to deliver [[vaccines]] more effectively to developing countries. The program differentiates itself from others like it by focusing on the delivery of the beneficial product to the end-user rather than the academic research process.

'''Global Precipitation Measurement''' ('''GPM''') or '''Global Precipitation Index''' ('''GPI''') is a joint mission between [[JAXA]] and [[NASA]] as well as other international space agencies to make frequent (every 2–3 hours) observations of Earth’s [[precipitation]]. It is part of NASA's Earth Systematic Missions program and works with a [[satellite constellation]] to provide full global coverage. The project provides global precipitation maps to assist researchers in improving the forecasting of extreme events, studying global climate, and adding to current capabilities for using such satellite data to benefit society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Global Precipitation Measurement Mission|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/GPM/overview/index.html|publisher=NASA|accessdate=2014-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; GPM builds on the notable successes of the [[Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission]] (TRMM), which was also a joint NASA-JAXA activity.

The project is managed by NASA's [[Goddard Space Flight Center]], and consists of a GPM Core Observatory satellite assisted by a constellation of spacecraft from other agencies and missions.&lt;ref name="Constellation Partners"&gt;{{cite web|title=Constellation Partners|url=http://pmm.nasa.gov/GPM/constellation-partners|publisher=NASA|accessdate=2014-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Core Observatory satellite measures the two and three dimensional structure of Earth’s precipitation patterns and provides a new calibration standard for the rest of the satellite constellation. The GPM Core Observatory was assembled and tested at Goddard Space Flight Center, and launched from [[Tanegashima Space Center]], Japan, on a [[Mitsubishi Heavy Industries]] [[H-IIA]] rocket. The launch occurred on February 28, 2014 at 3:37am JST on the first attempt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=GPM Launch Information|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/GPM/launch/index.html|publisher=NASA|accessdate=2014-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Agencies in the United States, [[Japan]], [[India]] and [[France]] (together with [[Eumetsat]]) operate the remaining satellites in the constellation for agency-specific goals, but also cooperatively provide data for GPM.&lt;ref name="Constellation Partners"/&gt;

===Dual-Frequency Precipitation Radar (DPR)===
The DPR is a spaceborne radar, providing three-dimensional maps of storm structure across its swath, including the intensity of rainfall and snowfall at the surface. The DPR has two frequencies, allowing researchers to estimate the sizes of precipitation particles and detect a wider range of precipitation rates. The Ku-band radar, similar to the PR on TRMM, covers a 245&amp;nbsp;km (152 mile) swath. Nested inside that, the Ka-band radar covers a 120&amp;nbsp;km (74.5 mile) swath.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|title=GPM Spacecraft and Instruments|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/GPM/spacecraft/index.html|publisher=NASA|accessdate=2014-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Data from the DPR is sent to the ground via a single-access link with [[TDRSS]] relay satellites.&lt;ref name="NASA Core observatory page"&gt;[https://pmm.nasa.gov/gpm/flight-project/core-observatory "Global Precipitation Measurement Mission Core Observatory"].

===GPM Microwave Imager (GMI)===
The GMI is a passive sensor that observes the microwave energy emitted by the Earth and atmosphere at 13 different frequency/polarization channels. These data allow quantitative maps of precipitation across a swath that is 885&amp;nbsp;km (550 miles) wide. This instrument continues the legacy of TRMM microwave observations, while adding four additional channels, better resolution, and more reliable calibration.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; Data from the GMI is continuously sent to the ground via a multiple-access link with TDRSS relay satellites.&lt;ref name="NASA Core observatory page"/&gt;

==Precipitation data sets==
GPM produces and distributes a wide variety of precipitation data products. Processing takes place at the Precipitation Processing System (PPS) at NASA [[Goddard Space Flight Center]], as well as at the JAXA facility in Japan. Data is provided at multiple "levels" of processing, from raw satellite measurements to best-estimate global precipitation maps using combinations of all the constellation observations and other meteorological data. All data from the mission is made freely available to the public on NASA websites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Explanation of Data Products|url=http://pmm.nasa.gov/data-access/data-products|publisher=NASA|accessdate=2014-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Precipitation data is made available in a variety of formats, spatial and temporal resolutions, and processing levels which are accessible on the Precipitation Measurement Missions "Data Access" webpage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://pmm.nasa.gov/data-access|title=Data Access {{!}} Precipitation Measurement Missions|website=pmm.nasa.gov|access-date=2017-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several data visualization and analysis tools have been made available to provide easy access for the science and applications communities, which include the in-browser Earth science data analysis tool Giovanni,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://giovanni.gsfc.nasa.gov/giovanni/|title=Giovanni|website=giovanni.gsfc.nasa.gov|access-date=2017-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; a web API,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://pmm.nasa.gov/precip-apps|title=Precipitation and Applications Viewer {{!}} Precipitation Measurement Missions|website=pmm.nasa.gov|access-date=2017-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a 3D near-realtime global precipitation viewer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://pmm.nasa.gov/data-access/global-viewer|title=Global Precipitation Viewer {{!}} Precipitation Measurement Missions|website=pmm.nasa.gov|access-date=2017-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2380">A '''Heavy snow warning''' was a weather warning issued by the [[National Weather Service]] of the [[United States]] during times when a high rate of [[snow]]fall was occurring or was forecast.  Generally, the warning was issued for snowfall rates of {{convert|6|in|cm}} or more in 12&amp;nbsp;hours, or {{convert|8|in|cm}} or more in 24&amp;nbsp;hours.

This warning was discontinued beginning with the 2008-09 winter storm season, replaced by the [[Winter Storm Warning]] for Heavy Snow.

A similar warning is issued by [[Environment Canada]]'s [[Meteorological Service of Canada]]

==Example of a heavy snow warning==

On June 8, 1997, he became the first Korean to sail around the world single-handedly, when he completed a [[circumnavigation]] on a 30-foot (9.2-meter) [[sailboat]] ''Pioneer 2'' (선구자 2), covering over 70,000 kilometers in 3 years and 5 months.&lt;ref name="Donga1"&gt;{{cite news|last=Jun|first=Chang|title=[스포츠종합] 강동석, 41개월간 한국인 최초 '단독 요트 세계일주'|trans-title=Sports News - First Korean solo-Circumnavigator Kang Dong-suk sailing for 41 months|url=http://news.donga.com/3/all/20041130/8134012/1|accessdate=2017-08-05|work=[[The Dong-a Ilbo]]|date=2004-11-30| language=Korean|location=Seoul}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hankook"&gt;{{cite news|last=Lee|first=Chang-Ho|title=People 강동석 - 내 인생의 8할은 도전과 모험이었이었다|trans-title=My Life was mostly Challenges and Adventures|url=http://sports.hankooki.com/lpage/people/201012/sp20101217170132106610.htm|work=Sports [[Hankook Ilbo]] Daily|date=2010-12-17|accessdate=2017-08-05|language=Korean|location=Seoul}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1991, he completed the first [[single-handed sailing]] voyage of the [[Pacific]] by a Korean in his first sailboat ''Pioneer 1'' (선구자 1), a 29-foot (8.7-meter) boat, travelling the distance of 11,700 kilometers in 7 months.  After arriving in Korea, he donated the Pioneer 1 to the [[Korea Naval Academy]].&lt;ref name="Hankook" /&gt;

'''Karl Bushby''' (born 30 March 1969) is a [[United Kingdom|British]] ex-[[paratrooper]], walking [[adventurer]] and author, currently attempting to be the first person to completely walk an unbroken path around the world. Bushby's trek is known as the '''Goliath Expedition'''.

==Early life==
Bushby was born 30 March 1969 in [[Kingston upon Hull|Hull]], [[England]]. He attended a local comprehensive school and joined the [[British Army]] at the age of 16. Bushby served with the 3rd Battalion [[Parachute Regiment (United Kingdom)|The Parachute Regiment]] for 11 years.

==Goliath Expedition==
[[File:Goliatexpeditionmap.jpg|thumb|right|The planned route for the expedition]]
The '''Goliath Expedition''' is Bushby's attempt to walk around the world "with unbroken footsteps", from [[Punta Arenas]], [[Chile]], to his home in [[Kingston upon Hull|Hull]], [[England]]. He began his journey on 1 November 1998 and originally expected to finish the over-{{convert|36000|mi}} trek in 8 years, though numerous delays ensure it will not be completed until sometime after 2018.

Bushby set off from [[Punta Arenas]], [[Chile]], on 1 November 1998, and had completed over {{convert|17000|mi}} as of 2006, walking through South, Central, and North America. With over {{convert|19000|mi}} to walk, and maintaining his current speed, he then estimated he would return home to Hull, England, by 2012.

In March 2006, Bushby and French adventurer [[Dimitri Kieffer]] crossed the [[Bering Strait]] on foot, having to take a roundabout 14-day route across a frozen {{convert|150|mi|adj=on}} section to cross the {{convert|58|mi|adj=on}} wide strait from Alaska to Siberia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/humber/4872348.stm Epic explorer crosses frozen sea] BBC News, 3 April 2006. URL accessed on 13 June 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; They were detained by Russian border troop officers while they were crossing the Russian border near the [[Chukotka Autonomous Okrug|Chukotkan]] village of [[Uelen]], for not entering Russia at a correct port-of-entry. They were threatened to be banned from Russia, which would stop the journey.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4905160.stm Judge to decide explorer's fate] BBC News, 12 April 2006. URL accessed on 13 June 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; It was announced on 5 May 2006, that the Russian appeal court had upheld Bushby's application and his walk would continue.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/england/humber/4975988.stm Explorer's world trek continues] BBC News, 5 May 2006. URL accessed on 13 June 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; This was reported to be the result of consultation between [[John Prescott]], the then British [[Deputy Prime Minister]] (and [[Member of Parliament|MP]] in Bushby's home town of Hull), and [[Roman Abramovich]], the then Governor of Chukotka.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/russia/article/0,,1768582,00.html Russia lifts ban on British trekker] Guardian Unlimited, 5 May 2006. URL accessed on 13 June 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 16 March 2007, it was announced that Bushby has successfully obtained the required permission from the Russian authorities, and began to prepare for the second half of his Goliath Expedition. Bushby would walk the first leg of this stage to [[Yakutsk]], along with Kieffer. He had a difficult struggle with the Russian authorities to get a visa and a visit permit (the entire area is a military area, and a special visit permit is needed). During 2007, he managed to walk more than {{convert|1000|km|disp=flip}} from [[Uelen]] to Dvoynoye (not far from [[Bilibino]]), returning to Alaska when his visa ran out in November.

In 2008 he only walked for three weeks, reaching [[Bilibino]]. He started very late, since the visa approval was delayed, and when the snow disappeared in May he could not continue because the area is filled with swamps and rivers, impossible to penetrate on foot when not frozen. He is only allowed to be in Russia for 90 days out of every 180 days per visa, and he must leave the country before each visa expires.

From late 2008 to 2010, he spent his time in Mexico for cost reasons and was unable to travel to Russia. This was both because of trouble getting a visa and permits, and because of financial trouble; Bushby lost several of his sponsors as a result of the [[Late-2000s financial crisis]].&lt;ref name="homepage"&gt;[http://www.odysseyxxi.com/ Goliath Expedition home page.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090911064959/http://odysseyxxi.com/ |date=11 September 2009 }}  URL accessed on 28 June 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  After Bushby secured new sponsors in 2010, the Russian government issued him another visa, and he resumed walking across Russia in the spring of 2011.&lt;ref name="homepage" /&gt;

In addition to the 90-day time restraint imposed by Russian visas, Bushby has been hampered by the [[tundra]] conditions. Because his route takes him through an area that can only be traveled on foot via frozen rivers and ice roads, he can only walk during the late winter and early spring.&lt;ref&gt;[http://askyakutia.com/2011/05/karl-bushby-uk-explorer-walk-expedition-odyssey-bilibino-chukotka-srednekolymsk-yakutsk-yakutia-siberia-russia-arctic-tundra/ Karl Bushby, the UK explorer, about his walking from Bilibino (Chukotka) &amp; Srednekolymsk (Sakha-Yakutia), Russia’s Far East.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111005072214/http://askyakutia.com/2011/05/karl-bushby-uk-explorer-walk-expedition-odyssey-bilibino-chukotka-srednekolymsk-yakutsk-yakutia-siberia-russia-arctic-tundra/ |date=5 October 2011 }} Ask Yakutia, 5 May 2011. URL accessed on 28 June 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  On 25 April 2011, after walking approximately {{convert|1100|km|disp=flip}}, Bushby reached the town of [[Srednekolymsk]], completing his leg for 2011.&lt;ref name="homepage" /&gt;  Beginning his 2012 leg, he  only needed to travel an additional {{convert|900|km|disp=flip}} before reaching improved roads, meaning  his travel will only be limited by the Russian visa rules. On 12 April 2012, Bushby reported on his site that the Russian authorities had denied him a visa for 2012. He will continue to try to obtain a visa at some point in the future.&lt;ref name="homepage" /&gt;

In March 2013 Russia banned Bushby from re-entering Russia for five years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hulldailymail.co.uk/Russia-ban-Hull-s-round-world-walker-Karl-Bushby/story-18460279-detail/story.html|title=Russia ban for Hull's round-the-world walker Karl Bushby|last=Shoesmith|first=Kevin|date=19 March 2013|website=Hull Daily Mail|access-date=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140203182708/http://www.hulldailymail.co.uk/Russia-ban-Hull-s-round-world-walker-Karl-Bushby/story-18460279-detail/story.html|archivedate=3 February 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With help from [[National Geographic Society|National Geographic]] Bushby walked over 3,000 miles from [[Los Angeles]] to [[Washington DC]]. His destination was the Russian Embassy. At the end of the adventure Bushby's visa ban was overturned and he was granted a letter of invitation from the Russian government. He was granted a visa in 2014, at the embassy, marking the end of his year long journey.

Bushby crossed Russia-Mongolia border in 2017, and as of 08 August 2017 he is in [[Ulaanbaatar]], Mongolia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.hulldailymail.co.uk/news/hull-east-yorkshire-news/hull-adventurer-karl-bushby-camels-295155|title=How Karl Bushby plans to use camels on latest leg of 36,000-mile trek|last=Shoesmith|first=Kevin|date=2017-08-08|work=hulldailymail|access-date=2017-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Giant Steps==
Bushby wrote a book about his walk entitled ''Giant Steps'', first published in 2005. The latest edition (2007) includes events up to 31 March 2006, and his [[Bering Strait]] crossing.

'''''Kaya''''' (plural ''makaya'' or kayas) is a [[sacred grove|sacred forest]] of the [[Mijikenda peoples|Mijikenda people]] in the former [[Coast Province]] of [[Kenya]]. The ''kaya'' forest is considered to be an intrinsic source of ritual power and the origin of cultural identity;{{sfn|Parkin|2006|p=37}} it is also a place of prayer for members of the particular ethnic group.&lt;ref name=Nyamweru1996&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nyamweru|first=Celia|title=Sacred Groves Threatened by Development: The Kaya Forests of Kenya|journal=Cultural Survival Quarterly|date=Fall 1996|volume=20|series="Who's Local Here?"

Many ''kaya'' were originally fortified villages of the various ethnic groups, the [[Digo people|Digo]], [[Chonyi]], [[Kambe]], [[Duruma]], [[Kauma]], [[Ribe (ethnic group)|Ribe]], [[Rabai]], [[Jibana]], and [[Giriama]] people. The villages have lowland tropical forest areas in their surrounds and were reached via paths through the forest. The forest flora was used solely for the collection of medicinal herbs. The practices of tree cutting, livestock grazing, and farmland clearing were not permitted within a ''kaya''.&lt;ref name=Nyamweru1996 /&gt;

In the present day, intensive deforestation for agricultural use and logging necessitated declaring 38 ''kaya'' forest areas legally as national monuments. Local communities manage these areas.{{sfn|Zeppel|2006|p=136}}

==Wildlife and conservation==
Wildlife in the Kaya Kinodao area has been identified which can be visited as part of ecotourism project. While plant species identified are 187 plant, bird species are 48, and butterflies 45 species.[[Colobus monkey]] and [[Golden-rumped elephant shrew]] are also reported.{{sfn|Zeppel|2006|p=136}}

Entry into the forest was dictated by the traditional rules set by a governing body called the ''ngambi'' formed by elderly members of the community. This governing body was primarily concerned with its management, conservation and utilization of the biological resources in adherence to the traditional beliefs about the sacredness of the forest. However, the creation of central governing body has affected the role of the local elders.{{sfn|Trosper|2011|p=58}}

An Eco Tourism project was launched in 2001 with funds provided by [[Ford Foundation]] with the objective of generating income for the local people and also encourage ecotorism and concurrently help preserve the sacredness of the forests.{{sfn|Zeppel|2006|p=136}}  Eleven Mijikenda ''kaya'' were grouped together and inscribed as the Sacred Mijikenda Kaya Forests, a World Heritage Site, in 2008 under criteria (iii), (v), and (vi).&lt;ref name=Unesco&gt;{{cite web|title=Sacred Mijikenda Kaya Forests|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1231|publisher=UNESCO|accessdate=14 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Culture==
[[Fingo (talisman)|''Fingo'']] (protective talismans) are buried in the ''kaya'' and are cared for by ''kaya'' elders who protect the traditions of the Mijikenda.{{sfn|Njogu|Middleton|2009|pp=296-297}} Mijikenda believe that they brought the ''fingo'' charms from their ancestral home of [[Shungwaya]], a [[myth of origin]]. In the present day, many ''fingo'' are lost or stolen, considered to be [[objet d'art]].{{sfn|Trillo|2013|p=551}}

There are many myths and beliefs narrated by the local women of the area which relate to the sacredness of these forests. It is the general belief that the forests are inhabited by [[spirits]]. Some of them believe that cutting a tree with a [[machete]] could result in the machete rebounding and causing injury to the leg which could be healed only by offering cloth to village elders in a ceremony. It is also believed that food cooked using wood from these sacred forest could cause sickness, and also that a dwelling built with timber drawn from the forest would collapse. The conservation of  the sacredness of the forest was aimed at preserving its darkness.{{sfn|Eaton|Lorentzen|2004|p=48}}

The '''Kjartansson constant Q model''' uses [[mathematical Q models]] to explain how the earth responds to [[seismic wave]]s and is widely used in seismic geophysical applications. Because these models satisfies the [[Kramers–Kronig relations|Krämers–Krönig relations]] they should be preferable to the [[The Kolsky basic model and modified model for attenuation and dispersion|Kolsky model]] in [[seismic inverse Q filtering]]. Kjartanssons model is a simplification of the first of [[Azimi Q models]] &lt;ref name="Azimi1968"&gt;Azimi S.A.Kalinin A.V. Kalinin V.V and Pivovarov B.L.1968. Impulse and transient characteristics of media with linear and quadratic absorption laws. Izvestiya – Physics of the Solid Earth 2. pp. 88–93&lt;/ref&gt; (1968).

==Kjartansson constant Q model==

Kjartanssons model is a simplification of the first of [[Azimi Q models]].&lt;ref name="Azimi1968"/&gt; Azimi proposed his first model together with &lt;ref&gt;Strick E. The determination of Q, dynamic viscosity and transient creep curves from wave propagation measurements. Geophysical Journal of the Royal Astronomical Society 13, pp. 197–218&lt;/ref&gt; Strick (1967) and has the attenuation proportional to |''w''|&lt;sup&gt;1 − ''γ''|&lt;/sup&gt; and is:

:&lt;math&gt; \alpha (w)=a_1|w|^{1-\gamma} \quad (1.1)&lt;/math&gt;

The phase velocity is written:

:&lt;math&gt; \frac {1}{c(w)} = \frac {1}{c_\infty} +a_1|w|^{-\gamma} \cot(\frac{\pi \gamma}{2}) \quad (1.2)&lt;/math&gt;

If the phase velocity goes to infinity in the first term on the right, we simply has:

:&lt;math&gt; \frac {1}{c(w)} = a_1|w|^{-\gamma} \cot(\frac{\pi \gamma}{2}) \quad (1.2)&lt;/math&gt;

This is Kjartansson constant Q model.

==Computations==

Studying the attenuation coefficient and phase velocity, and compare them with Kolskys Q model we have plotted the result on fig.1. The data for the models are taken from Ursin and Toverud.&lt;ref&gt;Ursin B. and Toverud T. 2002 Comparison of seismic dispersion and attenuation models. Studia Geophysica et Geodaetica 46, 293–320.&lt;/ref&gt;

Data for the Kolsky model (blue):

''c''&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt; = 2000&amp;nbsp;m/s, ''Q''&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt; = 100, ''w''&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt; = 2{{pi}}100

Data for Kjartansson constant Q model (green):

''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = 2.5 × 10 &lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt;, ''γ'' = 0.0031

[[File:B60227df7efed11ec27fc3628b239efe 500.jpg|thumb|ancient postcard representing Korrigans]]
In [[Brittany|Breton]] [[Celtic mythology|folklore]], a '''Korrigan''' ({{IPA-br|kɔˈriːɡɑ̃n|}} is a [[fairy]] or [[dwarf (Germanic mythology)|dwarf]]-like spirit. The word ''korrigan'' means "small-dwarf" (''korr'' means dwarf, ''ig'' is a [[diminutive]] and the [[Affix|suffix]] ''an'' is a [[hypocorism|hypocoristic]]). It is closely related to the [[Cornish language|Cornish]] word ''korrik'' which means ''gnome''. The name changes according to the place. Among the other names, there are ''korrig'',&lt;ref name="Theresa Bane"&gt;Theresa Bane, ''Encyclopedia of Fairies in World Folklore and Mythology'', p205, 2013, [[McFarland &amp; Company]], {{ISBN|978-0-7864-7111-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''korred'',&lt;ref name="Theresa Bane"/&gt; ''korrs'',&lt;ref name="Theresa Bane"/&gt; ''kores'',&lt;ref name="Theresa Bane"/&gt; ''couril'',&lt;ref name="Theresa Bane"/&gt; ''crion'',&lt;ref name="Theresa Bane"/&gt; ''goric'',&lt;ref name="Theresa Bane"/&gt; ''kornandon'', ''ozigan'', ''nozigan'', ''torrigan'', ''viltañs'', ''poulpikan'', ''paotred ar sabad''...{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

==As fairies and dwarves==
The term is used variously by writers on Breton folklore. [[Théodore Claude Henri, vicomte Hersart de la Villemarqué|Théodore de Villemarqué]] in ''[[Barzaz Breiz]]'' uses the term interchangeably with "fairy" and distinguishes them from dwarves ("nains"). In contrast [[Walter Evans-Wentz]] in ''The Fairy Faith in Celtic Countries'' argued that in the mythology of [[Morbihan]] there is no clear distinction between korrigans and nains: "Very often corrigans regarded as nains, equally with all kinds of ''lutins'', are believed to be evil spirits or demons condemned to live here on earth in a penitential state for an indefinite time."&lt;ref&gt;W. Y. Evans-Wentz, ''The Fairy Faith in Celtic Countries'', p.212.&lt;/ref&gt; They like to dance around fountains. However, they give themselves away when they cannot enumerate the full list of the days of the week (because of the sacredness of the full week).

==As siren water-sprites==
Other authors use the term only to refer to siren-like female fairies who inhabit springs and rivers, "lovely lustful golden-haired women who tried to lure men into their beds – and into a watery death".&lt;ref name = "pat"&gt;Patricia Monaghan, ''The encyclopedia of Celtic mythology and folklore'', Infobase Publishing, 2004, p.275.&lt;/ref&gt; These creatures are very beautiful when seen at dusk or night, but by day their eyes are red, their hair white, and their skin wrinkled; thus they try to avoid being seen by day.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.celtic-twilight.com/otherworld/fairy_mythology/brittany.htm The Fairy Mythology – Brittany]&lt;/ref&gt;

Korrigans have beautiful [[hair]] and red flashing [[eye]]s. They are sometimes described as important princesses or [[druid]]esses who were opposed to [[Christianity]] when the [[Apostle (Christian)|Apostles]] came to convert [[Brittany]]. They hate priests, churches, and especially the [[Veneration of Mary in Roman Catholicism|Virgin Mary]].&lt;ref name = "pat"/&gt; They can predict the future, change shape, and move at lightning speed. Like [[siren (mythology)|siren]]s and [[mermaid]]s, they sing and comb their long hair, and they haunt [[fountain]]s and [[water well]]s. They have the power of making men fall in love with them, but they then kill the ones who do. In many popular tales, they are eager to deceive the imprudent mortals who see them dancing or looking after a treasure, and fond of stealing human children, substituting them with [[changeling]]s. On the night of 31 October ([[Samhain]]), they are said to be lurking near [[dolmen]]s, waiting for victims.

According to the Breton poem, Ar-Rannou, there are 9 korrigans, "who dance, with flowers in their hair, and robes of white wool, around the fountain, by the light of the full moon."&lt;ref&gt;Keightley, 2000, pp. 420–422.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Local Nature Reserve]]s (LNRs) are designated by local authorities under the [[National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949]]. The local authority must have a legal control over the site, by owning or leasing it or having an agreement with the owner. LNRs are sites which have a special local interest either biologically or geologically, and local authorities have a duty to care for them. They can apply local [[Byelaws in the United Kingdom|bye-laws]] to manage and protect LNRs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/protected-or-designated-areas|title=Protected or Designated Areas|date=9 April 2013|publisher=Department for Environment, Food &amp; Rural Affairs and Natural England|accessdate=29 July 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150504145328/https://www.gov.uk/protected-or-designated-areas|archivedate=4 May 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/create-and-manage-local-nature-reserves|title=Local Nature Reserves: Setting up and Management|date=2 October 2014|publisher=Department for Environment, Food &amp; Rural Affairs and Natural England|accessdate=29 July 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150704111109/https://www.gov.uk/create-and-manage-local-nature-reserves|archivedate=4 July 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are at least '''45 named [[oil field]]s in [[Montana]]''' according to the [[U.S. Geological Survey]], Board of Geographic Names. The USGS defines ''oil field'' as: "Area where petroleum is or was removed from the Earth."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://geonames.usgs.gov/pls/gnispublic/f?p=154:8:2386825790526740 |title=U.S. Geographic Names Information System-Feature Class Definition |publisher=U.S. Geological Survey |accessdate=2011-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''oil field''' is a region with an abundance of [[oil well]]s extracting [[petroleum]] (crude oil) from below ground. Because the [[oil reservoir]]s typically extend over a large area, possibly several hundred kilometres across, full exploitation entails multiple wells scattered across the area. In addition, there may be exploratory wells probing the edges, pipelines to transport the oil elsewhere, and support facilities.

The [[Schlumberger]] Oilfield Glossary defines ''oil field'' as: "An accumulation, pool or group of pools of oil in the subsurface. An oil field consists of a reservoir in a shape that will trap hydrocarbons and that is covered by an impermeable or sealing rock. Typically, industry professionals use the term with an implied assumption of economic size."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.glossary.oilfield.slb.com/ |title=Schlumberger Oil Glossary |accessdate=2011-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''magnetic weapon''' is one that uses magnetic fields to accelerate or stop projectiles, or to focus charged particle beams. There are many hypothesised magnetic weapons, such as the [[railgun]] and [[coilgun]] which accelerate a [[magnetic]] (in the case of railguns; non-magnetic) mass to a high velocity, or [[ion cannon]]s and [[Plasma cannon (disambiguation)|plasma cannon]]s which focus and direct charged particles using magnetic fields.

[[Railgun]]s use two parallel metal rails connected to a power supply. When a conductive projectile is placed between the rails, the circuit is completed and a magnetic field is created down the rails up to the point of the projectile. This creates a force which pushes the projectile along the track, accelerating it to great speeds until it leaves the rails and the circuit is broken.

[[Coilgun]]s, on the other hand, have a barrel made up of coils of magnetic material. The projectile is placed between the coils, which have a pulse of electricity passed through them. This pulls the projectile into the centre of the coil. The coils further down the track are then pulsed in sequence at specific times, accelerating the projectile until it leaves the barrel. 

[[Ion cannon]]s are [[directed-energy weapon|beam weapon]]s that fire beams of [[ion]]s (particles, i.e. [[atom]]s that have been affected in some way as to cause them to gain an [[electrical]] charge). Ion cannons are actually [[particle cannon]]s; only the particles used are ionized. Due to their electrical charges, the fired ions also have the potential to disable electronic devices, vehicles, and anything else that has an electrical or similar power source. The inspiration for this effect arises from the [[electromagnetic pulse]] generated by nuclear detonations, which can be devastating to electronic devices.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3565">'''Medical cybernetics''' is a branch of [[cybernetics]] which has been heavily affected by the development of the [[computer]],&lt;ref&gt;Brian H. Rudall (2000). "Cybernetics and systems in the 1980s". In: ''Kybernetes''. Vol 29. Issue 5/6 p.595-611.&lt;/ref&gt; which applies the concepts of cybernetics to [[medical research]] and practice. It covers an emerging working program for the application of [[systems theory|systems]]- and [[communication theory]], [[connectionism]] and [[decision theory]] on biomedical research and health related questions.

== Overview ==
Medical cybernetics searches for quantitative descriptions of biological dynamics.&lt;ref name="JWD04"&gt;J.W. Dietrich (2004), [http://www.medical-cybernetics.de/definition.html ''Medical Cybernetics – A Definition''], Medizinische Kybernetik, 2004. Released under creative commons 2.0 attribution licence.&lt;/ref&gt; It investigates intercausal networks in [[human biology]], [[Decision-making|medical decision making]] and [[information processing]] structures in the [[living organism]].

Topics in medical cybernetics:
* [[Systems theory]] in medical sciences: The scope of  systems theory in the medical sciences is searching for and modelling of physiological dynamics in the intact and diseased organism to gain deeper insights into the organizational principles of life and its perturbations.&lt;ref name="JWD04"/&gt;
* Medical information and [[communication theory]]: Motivated by the awareness of information as an essential principle of life the application of communication theory to biomedicine aims to mathematically describe signalling processes and information storage in different physiological layers.&lt;ref name="JWD04"/&gt;
* [[Connectionism]]: Connectionistic models describe information processing in neural networks – thus forming a bridge between biological and technological research.&lt;ref name="JWD04"/&gt;
* Medical decision theory (MDT): The Goal of MDT is to gather evidence based foundations for decision making in the clinical setting.&lt;ref name="JWD04"/&gt;

[[Image:Paléotéthys.jpg|thumb|Location of the Paleo-Tethys Ocean circa 280 million years ago]]
The '''Paleo-Tethys''' or '''Palaeo-Tethys Ocean''' was an [[ocean]] located along the northern margin of the [[paleocontinent]] [[Gondwana]] that started to open during the [[Middle Cambrian]], grew throughout the [[Paleozoic]], and finally closed during the Late [[Triassic]]; existing for about 400 million years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Zhai|Jahn|Wang|Hu|2015|loc=Abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Paleo-Tethys was a precursor to the [[Tethys Ocean]] (also called the Neo-Tethys) which was located between Gondwana and the [[Hunic terranes]] (continental fragments that broke-off Gondwana and moved north).  It opened as the [[Proto-Tethys Ocean]] subducted under these terranes and closed as the [[Cimmeria (continent)|Cimmerian terranes]] (that also broke-off Gondwana and moved north) gave way to the Tethys Ocean.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Muttoni|Gaetani|Kent|Sciunnach|2009|loc=Fig. 2, p. 19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Confusingly, the Neo-Tethys is sometimes defined as the ocean south of a hypothesised mid-ocean ridge separating Greater Indian from Asia, in which case the ocean between Cimmeria and this hypothesised ridge is called the Meso-Tethys, i.e. the "Middle-Tethys".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Müller|Seton|2015|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The so-called Hunic terranes are divided into the ''European Hunic'' (today the [[Crust (geology)|crust]] under parts of Europe – called [[Armorican terrane|Armorica]] – and [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberia]]) and ''Asiatic Hunic'' (today the crust of parts of southern Asia). A large [[transform fault]] separated the two [[terrane]]s.

The role the Paleo-Tethys played in the [[supercontinent cycle]], and especially the break-up of [[Pangaea]], is unresolved.  Some geologists argue that the opening of the North Atlantic was triggered by the subduction of [[Panthalassa]] under the western margins of the Americas while other argue that the closure of the Paleo-Tethys and Tethys resulted in the break-up.  In the first scenario, [[mantle plume]]s caused the opening of the Atlantic and the break-up of Pangaea and the closure of the Tethyan domain was one of the consequences of this process; in the other scenario, the longitudinal forces that closed the Tethyan domain were transmitted latitudinally in what is today the Mediterranean region, resulting in the initial opening of the Atlantic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Keppie|2015a|loc=Abstract}}; {{Harvnb|Keppie|2015b|loc=Abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Image:290 global.png|right|200px|thumb|Image of Paleo-Tethys Ocean, before the Cimmerian Plate moves north, which made the ocean closed, the Paleo-Tethys Ocean closed off about 180 mya. ~290 mya (Early Permian).]]
[[Image:249 global.png|right|200px|thumb|The Cimmerian plate starts to move northward, closing the Paleo-Tethys Ocean, while the Tethys Ocean begins to open from the south. ~249 mya (Permian-Triassic boundary).]]

The Paleo-Tethys Ocean began to form when [[Back-arc basin|back-arc]] spreading separated the European Hunic terranes from Gondwana in the late [[Ordovician]], to begin moving toward [[Euramerica]] (also known as the Old Red Sandstone Continent) in the north.  In the process, the plate under the [[Rheic Ocean]] between Euramerica and the European Hunic terranes subducted and [[rift]]s in this plate resulted in the formation of a small [[Rhenohercynian Basin|Rhenhercynian Ocean]] which lasted until Late Carboniferous time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Stampfli|von Raumer|Borel|2002|loc=Middle Devonian Phase, p. 272}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Stampfli-etal-2002-fig3"&gt;{{Harvnb|Stampfli|von Raumer|Borel|2002|loc=Fig. 3, pp. 268–629}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Early [[Devonian]], the eastern part of Paleo-Tethys opened up, when the Asiatic Hunic terranes, including the [[North China (continent)|North]] and [[South China (continent)|South China]] microcontinents, moved northward.&lt;ref name="Stampfli-etal-2002-fig3" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Stampfli|von Raumer|Borel|2002|loc=Hun Superterrane, p. 267}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These events caused [[Proto-Tethys Ocean]], a precursor of Paleo-Tethys, to shrink, until the Late [[Carboniferous]], when the Chinese blocks collided with [[Siberia (continent)|Siberia]].&lt;ref name="Stampfli-etal-2002-fig3" /&gt;  In the Early Carboniferous however, a [[Subduction|subduction zone]] developed south of the European Hunic terranes consuming Paleo-Tethys [[oceanic crust]].
&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Stampfli|von Raumer|Borel|2002|loc=European Hunic active margin in Armorica (''sensu lato''), p. 273}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Gondwana started moving north, in the process the western part of the Paleo-Tethys would close.&lt;ref name="Stampfli-etal-2002-fig3" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Stampfli|von Raumer|Borel|2002|loc=Fig. 4e, p. 270}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Carboniferous [[continental collision]] took place between the Old Red Sandstone Continent and the European Hunic terrane, in [[North America]] this is called the [[Alleghenian orogeny]], in [[Europe]] the [[Variscan orogeny]]. The [[Rheic Ocean]] had completely disappeared, and the western Paleo-Tethys was closing.

By the Late [[Permian]], the small elongated [[Cimmerian plate]] (today's crust of [[Turkey]], [[Iran]], [[Tibet]] and parts of [[South-East Asia]]) broke away from Gondwana (now part of [[Pangaea]]). South of the Cimmerian continent a new ocean, the [[Tethys Ocean]], was created. By the Late [[Triassic]], all that was left of the Paleo-Tethys Ocean was a narrow seaway.

In the Early [[Jurassic]] epoch, as part of the [[Alpine Orogeny]], the oceanic crust of the Paleo-Tethys subducted under the Cimmerian plate, closing the ocean from west to east. A last remnant of Paleo-Tethys Ocean might be an oceanic crust under the [[Black Sea]].  ([[Anatolia]], to the sea's south, is a part of the original Cimmerian continent that formed the southern boundary of the Paleo-Tethys.)

The Paleo-Tethys Ocean sat where the [[Indian Ocean]] and [[Southern Asia]] are now located. The [[Equator]] ran the length of the sea, giving it a tropical climate. The shores and islands probably supported dense [[coal forest]]s.

'''Peter Anthony Rose''' [[Order of the British Empire|MBE]] (music) and '''Anne Conlon''' [[Order of the British Empire|MBE]] (words) are award-winning writers best known for their environmental musicals for children. They were both teachers in [[Lancashire]], England, for the majority of their creative achievements and most of their works have been written specially for [[St Augustine's RC High School, Billington]]. At the time Peter Rose was their head of music.

== Notable works ==
Rose and Conlon's first collaboration was ''The Conversion Job'' (1980–1); a currently unpublished musical which told the story of Augustine and his monks as they tried to convert Britain to Christianity. This was first performed at St Augustine's RC High School. Their second collaboration was the choral piece ''The Kestrel Song'' (1982), which was later published by their publishers [[Josef Weinberger]] (1995). This piece describes

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"the thoughts of a [[kestrel]] as it hovers above the motorway… From the safety of the sky, the Kestrel watches "all the madness of these men rushing blindly onwards". The fog descends, but the traffic rushes on, until the inevitable disaster happens&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;"
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

''The Kestrel Song'' won them the ''1982 BBC Pebble Mill – WWF Sounds Natural'' competition, which brought the writers to the attention of Ivan Hattingh, Head of Development at [[World Wide Fund for Nature|WWF]]-UK at the time. Shortly after this, Ivan Hattingh called the writers and asked them to write an extended musical, similar to ''The Kestrel Song'', but about the [[Amazon Basin|Amazon]] [[Rainforest]]. Although it seemed an impossible task, they accepted and penned the first half of ''Yanomamo'' (1983), which described the beauties of the Amazon rainforest. By the second half, which contrasts the lighter first, the writers explore the human problems that existed in the Amazon basin at the time, and ask strong questions about western attitudes to tribal societies and our role in protecting such important and sensitive natural balances.

''Yanomamo'' is a 90-minute work for chorus, soloists, narrator and stage band, and the original production, performed by the choir and musicians of St Augustine's RC High School, was narrated by [[David Attenborough|Sir David Attenborough]] and premiered at the Royal Institute, London, before appearing at the [[Edinburgh Festival]]. They later performed ''Yanomamo'' in America, narrated by [[Sting (musician)|Sting]], which production was recorded for television and later broadcast (on Easter Sunday, 1989) on [[Channel 4]] under the title of ''Song of the Forest''. The TV version was commercially released by WWF. Since its publication the musical has seen performances by thousands of children throughout the world. This interest was also helped by the inclusion of ''Yanomamo'' as part of the [[BBC Radio]] Music Workshop series for schools (1991), including a short dramatic script specially written for the series by Conlon. After the TV adaption was broadcast, the school was officially recognised when two of the young soloists were presented to the [[Duke of Edinburgh]] and presented with the Ford European Conservation Award in the [[Royal Opera House]], [[Covent Garden]].

Rose and Conlon's next collaboration was in 1985 with ''Daughters of Pendle''. This fully dramatic musical explores 16th-century witchcraft in Lancashire, and was first performed by St Augustine's RC High School. The show is currently unpublished.

After the highly successful ''Yanomamo'', Ivan Hattingh commissioned Rose and Conlon to write another musical, outlining the severe problems of migration from the countryside to the cities in developing countries. ''African Jigsaw'' (1986) was written and first performed by the choir and musicians of St Augustine's RC High School at the [[Barbican Centre|Barbican Concert Hall]], London, narrated by actress [[Mary Miller (actress)|Mary Miller]] and winning a Henry Ford Conservation Award&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. ''African Jigsaw'' was also performed by the school at the [[Royal Festival Hall]] in 1987, this time with Sir [[Charles Groves]] and the Philharmonic Orchestra at a Royal Gala charity performance for the homeless. Again, this musical is a 90-minute work for chorus, soloists, narrator and stage band. ''African Jigsaw'' was later transmitted as a Splash Special by [[ITV Network|ITV]] in 1987, and also part of the ITV Middle English series. Conlon's narration explores the thoughts of one central character; an African mother who has stayed in the countryside whilst her son has started a new life for himself in the city.

Three years later saw their third WWF commission, ''Ocean World'' (1990). This time they focused on the problems that threaten the existence of the sea. ''Ocean World'' tells the story of a female [[humpback whale]] as she journeys to her northern feeding grounds. We are with her at the birth to her first calf, and along her journey we meet other creatures of the deep who have their own problems to contend with. Ocean World premiered at the Royal Festival Hall by the choir and musicians of St Augustine's RC High School and was narrated by Sir David Attenborough. A television version, currently available from WWF-UK, was made and transmitted in 1991 as part of Channel 4's ''Fragile Earth'' series. The work follows the same pattern as their previous WWF commissions, and is a 90-minute work for chorus, soloists, narrator and stage band.

Rose and Conlon are also known for writing work with a Christian message. In 1987, they were commissioned to write a Harvest Festival Anthem, "Care for your World", which was performed on BBC's ''[[Songs of Praise]]''. Two years later, in March 1989 their hymns were featured in ''[[The Daily Service]]'' on [[BBC Radio 4]]. 
 
Rose and Conlon did not collaborate after this until 1996, with the publication of their hymn book ''Hymns for a Caring World'', and their fourth WWF-UK commission ''Arabica'', inspired by a conference Conlon attended about world economics. ''Arabica'' is a musical about the coffee industry and the people involved in the growing, producing and selling of it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wwf.org.uk/about_wwf/working_with_schools/resources_hub/musicals/ "Musicals for schools"], WWF.&lt;/ref&gt; This was premiered at the [[Queen Elizabeth Hall]], London, by the choir and musicians of St Augustine's RC High School with narration by actor [[Burt Caesar]]. ''Arabica'' is arguably the most musically complex of their shows, and most controversial, and has never been broadcast.

There was question whether they would write another large-scale musical after ''Arabica'', but in 2000 they wrote ''Song of Creation''  to celebrate the millennium. ''Song of Creation'', unlike their WWF musicals, was written for the catholic charity [[CAFOD]], and premiered at the Royal Festival Hall, London. However, they kept their regular blueprint of writing for chorus, soloists, narrator and stage band. The original production of ''Song of Creation'' was narrated by Mary Miller, who also narrated their ''African Jigsaw'' in 1986.

By contrast to their WWF musicals, ''Song of Creation'' has no story as such, yet explores the wonders of creation and of human initiative, at the same time addressing the question of human responsibility for this human drive. Effectively, Rose and Conlon's latest work completes their cycle of environmental musicals by exploring the whole of the world in which we live; the natural balances that occur (which are also explored particularly in ''Yanomamo'' with regards to the rainforest), and the linking together of Western and Developing cultures (which is a theme that runs throughout their work, especially in ''African Jigsaw'').

Two new works by Rose and Conlon premiered in 2009. The first, commissioned by Children's International Voices of Enfield, is a smaller piece, ''Caledonian Shadows'', and was performed in London on Sunday 15 March. The second work is a full-length WWF-Commission, ''One Sun, One World'' and was performed at the [[Royal Albert Hall]] at the end of the year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wwf.org.uk/about_wwf/working_with_schools/resources_hub/musicals/one_sun_one_world_musical/about_one_sun__one_world_musical/ "About One Sun One World musical"], WWF.&lt;/ref&gt;

They were both appointed [[Member of the Order of the British Empire]] (MBE) in the [[2016 New Year Honours]] for services to musical education and conservation.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=61450|supp=y|pages=N18–N23|date=30 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Piezoelectricity''' is the [[electric charge]] that accumulates in certain solid materials (such as [[crystal]]s, certain [[ceramic]]s, and biological matter such as bone, [[DNA]] and various [[protein]]s)&lt;ref name='InstrumentAnalysis'&gt;{{cite book

The piezoelectric effect results from the linear electromechanical interaction between the mechanical and electrical states in crystalline materials with no [[Centrosymmetry|inversion symmetry]].&lt;ref name='Piezoelectric Sensorics'&gt;{{cite book |title=Piezoelectric Sensorics: Force, Strain, Pressure, Acceleration and Acoustic Emission Sensors, Materials and Amplifiers|isbn=978-3-662-04732-3|doi=10.1007/978-3-662-04732-3|year=2002 |first=G. |last=Gautschi |publisher=Springer}}&lt;/ref&gt; The piezoelectric effect is a [[reversible process (thermodynamics)|reversible process]]: materials exhibiting the piezoelectric effect (the internal generation of electrical charge resulting from an applied mechanical [[force]]) also exhibit the reverse piezoelectric effect, the internal generation of a mechanical strain resulting from an applied electrical field. For example, [[lead zirconate titanate]] crystals will generate measurable piezoelectricity when their static structure is deformed by about 0.1% of the original dimension. Conversely, those same crystals will change about 0.1% of their static dimension when an external electric field is applied to the material. The inverse piezoelectric effect is used in the production of ultrasonic sound waves.&lt;ref name='UT of Materials'&gt;{{cite book

Piezoelectricity is exploited in a number of useful applications, such as the production and detection of sound, piezoelectric [[inkjet printing]], generation of high voltages, electronic frequency generation, [[microbalance]]s, to drive an [[ultrasonic nozzle]], and ultrafine focusing of optical assemblies. It forms the basis for a number of scientific instrumental techniques with atomic resolution, the [[scanning probe microscopy|scanning probe microscopies]], such as [[scanning tunneling microscopy|STM]], [[atomic force microscopy|AFM]], [[microthermal analysis|MTA]], and [[scanning near-field optical microscopy|SNOM]]. It also finds everyday uses such as acting as the ignition source for [[lighters|cigarette lighters]], and push-start [[Barbecue#Natural gas and propane|propane barbecues]], as well as being used as the time reference source in [[Quartz clock|quartz watches]].

==History==

===Discovery and early research===
The [[pyroelectricity|pyroelectric effect]], by which a material generates an [[electric potential]] in response to a temperature change, was studied by [[Carl Linnaeus]] and [[Franz Aepinus]] in the mid-18th century. Drawing on this knowledge, both [[René Just Haüy]] and [[Antoine César Becquerel]] posited a relationship between mechanical stress and electric charge; however, experiments by both proved inconclusive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Erhart |first=Jiří |url=https://moodle.fp.tul.cz/nano/pluginfile.php/2476/mod_resource/content/3/FPM_Piezo_lecture1.pdf |title=Piezoelectricity and ferroelectricity: Phenomena and properties |publisher=Department of Physics, Technical University of Liberec |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140508030117/https://moodle.fp.tul.cz/nano/pluginfile.php/2476/mod_resource/content/3/FPM_Piezo_lecture1.pdf |archivedate=May 8, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first demonstration of the direct piezoelectric effect was in 1880 by the brothers [[Pierre Curie]] and [[Jacques Curie]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Jacques|last1=Curie|author1-link=Jacques Curie |first2=Pierre |last2=Curie|author2-link=Pierre Curie |date=1880 |title=Développement par compression de l'électricité polaire dans les cristaux hémièdres à faces inclinées |trans-title=Development, via compression, of electric polarization in hemihedral crystals with inclined faces |journal=Bulletin de la Société Minérologique de France |volume=3 |pages=90–93}}&lt;br&gt;

Quartz and Rochelle salt exhibited the most piezoelectricity.

[[Image:SchemaPiezo.gif|thumb|A piezoelectric disk generates a voltage when deformed (change in shape is greatly exaggerated)]]

The Curies, however, did not predict the converse piezoelectric effect. The converse effect was mathematically deduced from fundamental thermodynamic principles by [[Gabriel Lippmann]] in 1881.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first=G.|last=Lippmann|title=Principe de la conservation de l'électricité|trans-title=Principle of the conservation of electricity|journal=[[Annales de chimie et de physique]]|volume=24|page=145|url=http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k348640|year=1881|language=French|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160208081244/http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k348640|archivedate=2016-02-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Curies immediately confirmed the existence of the converse effect,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Jacques|last1=Curie|author1-link=Jacques Curie|first2=Pierre|last2=Curie|author2-link=Pierre Curie|date=1881|url=http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k3049g/f1131.image|title=Contractions et dilatations produites par des tensions dans les cristaux hémièdres à faces inclinées|trans-title=Contractions and expansions produced by voltages in hemihedral crystals with inclined faces|journal=Comptes Rendus|volume=93|pages=1137–1140|language=French|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121205084840/http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k3049g/f1131.image|archivedate=2012-12-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and went on to obtain quantitative proof of the complete reversibility of electro-elasto-mechanical deformations in piezoelectric crystals.

For the next few decades, piezoelectricity remained something of a laboratory curiosity. More work was done to explore and define the crystal structures that exhibited piezoelectricity. This culminated in 1910 with the publication of [[Woldemar Voigt]]'s ''Lehrbuch der Kristallphysik'' (''Textbook on Crystal Physics''),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Woldemar |last=Voigt |author-link=Woldemar Voigt |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SvPPAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PR1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Lehrbuch der Kristallphysik |location=Berlin |publisher=B. G. Teubner |date=1910 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140421051401/http://books.google.com/books?id=SvPPAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PR1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |archivedate=2014-04-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; which described the 20 natural crystal classes capable of piezoelectricity, and rigorously defined the piezoelectric constants using [[tensor analysis]].

===World War I and post-war===
The first practical application for piezoelectric devices was [[sonar]], first developed during [[World War I]]. In [[France]] in 1917, [[Paul Langevin]] and his coworkers developed an [[ultrasound|ultrasonic]] [[submarine]] detector.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url= http://rsnr.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/early/2012/03/06/rsnr.2011.0049.full |title= Who knew piezoelectricity? Rutherford and Langevin on submarine detection and the invention of sonar |last= Katzir |first= S. |journal= Notes Rec. R. Soc. |date= 2012 |volume= 66 |issue= 2 |pages= 141–157 |doi= 10.1098/rsnr.2011.0049 |deadurl= no |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20151117120955/http://rsnr.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/early/2012/03/06/rsnr.2011.0049.full |archivedate= 2015-11-17 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The detector consisted of a [[transducer]], made of thin quartz crystals carefully glued between two steel plates, and a [[hydrophone]] to detect the returned [[Echo (phenomenon)|echo]]. By emitting a high-frequency pulse from the transducer, and measuring the amount of time it takes to hear an echo from the sound waves bouncing off an object, one can calculate the distance to that object.

The use of piezoelectricity in sonar, and the success of that project, created intense development interest in piezoelectric devices. Over the next few decades, new piezoelectric materials and new applications for those materials were explored and developed.

Piezoelectric devices found homes in many fields. Ceramic [[phonograph]] cartridges simplified player design, were cheap and accurate, and made record players cheaper to maintain and easier to build. The development of the ultrasonic transducer allowed for easy measurement of viscosity and elasticity in fluids and solids, resulting in huge advances in materials research. Ultrasonic [[time-domain reflectometer]]s (which send an ultrasonic pulse through a material and measure reflections from discontinuities) could find flaws inside cast metal and stone objects, improving structural safety.

===World War II and post-war===
During [[World War II]], independent research groups in the [[United States]], [[Russia]], and [[Japan]] discovered a new class of synthetic materials, called [[ferroelectricity|ferroelectrics]], which exhibited piezoelectric constants many times higher than natural materials. This led to intense research to develop [[barium titanate]] and later lead zirconate titanate materials with specific properties for particular applications.

One significant example of the use of piezoelectric crystals was developed by Bell Telephone Laboratories. Following World War I, Frederick R. Lack, working in radio telephony in the engineering department, developed the “AT cut” crystal, a crystal that operated through a wide range of temperatures. Lack's crystal didn't need the heavy accessories previous crystal used, facilitating its use on aircraft. This development allowed Allied air forces to engage in coordinated mass attacks through the use of aviation radio.

Development of piezoelectric devices and materials in the United States was kept within the companies doing the development, mostly due to the wartime beginnings of the field, and in the interests of securing profitable patents. New materials were the first to be developed&amp;nbsp;— quartz crystals were the first commercially exploited piezoelectric material, but scientists searched for higher-performance materials. Despite the advances in materials and the maturation of manufacturing processes, the United States market did not grow as quickly as Japan's did. Without many new applications, the growth of the United States' piezoelectric industry suffered.

In contrast, Japanese manufacturers shared their information, quickly overcoming technical and manufacturing challenges and creating new markets. In Japan, a temperature stable crystal cut was developed by [[Issac Koga]]. Japanese efforts in materials research created piezoceramic materials competitive to the United States materials but free of expensive patent restrictions. Major Japanese piezoelectric developments included new designs of piezoceramic filters for radios and televisions, piezo buzzers and audio transducers that can connect directly to electronic circuits, and the [[piezo ignition|piezoelectric igniter]], which generates sparks for small engine ignition systems and gas-grill lighters, by compressing a ceramic disc. Ultrasonic transducers that transmit sound waves through air had existed for quite some time but first saw major commercial use in early television remote controls. These transducers now are mounted on several [[automobile|car]] models as an [[Acoustic location|echolocation]] device, helping the driver determine the distance from the car to any objects that may be in its path.

==Mechanism==
[[File:Piezo bending principle.jpg|thumb|Piezoelectric plate used to convert [[audio signal]] to sound waves]]
The nature of the piezoelectric effect is closely related to the occurrence of [[electric dipole moment]]s in solids. The latter may either be induced for [[ions]] on [[crystal lattice]] sites with asymmetric charge surroundings (as in [[BaTiO3|BaTiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]] and [[PZT]]s) or may directly be carried by molecular groups (as in [[cane sugar]]). The dipole density or [[Polarization density|polarization]] (dimensionality [C·m/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;] ) may easily be calculated for [[crystals]] by summing up the dipole moments per volume of the crystallographic [[unit cell]].&lt;ref name=ZPB1995a&gt;{{cite journal|author = M. Birkholz|title = Crystal-field induced dipoles in heteropolar crystals&amp;nbsp;– II. physical significance|journal = Z. Phys. B|volume = 96|pages = 333–340|year = 1995|doi = 10.1007/BF01313055|bibcode = 1995ZPhyB..96..333B|url = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/226272268|issue = 3|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20161030075927/https://www.researchgate.net/publication/226272268_Crystal-field_induced_dipoles_in_heteropolar_crystals_II_physical_significance|archivedate = 2016-10-30|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; As every dipole is a vector, the dipole density '''''P''''' is a [[vector field]]. Dipoles near each other tend to be aligned in regions called Weiss domains. The domains are usually randomly oriented, but can be aligned using the process of ''poling'' (not the same as [[magnet#Magnetizing ferromagnets|magnetic poling]]), a process by which a strong electric field is applied across the material, usually at elevated temperatures. Not all piezoelectric materials can be poled.&lt;ref name="PAMTA"&gt;{{Cite book|author = S. Trolier-McKinstry|editor1=A. Safari |editor2=E.K.

Of decisive importance for the piezoelectric effect is the change of polarization '''''P''''' when applying a [[mechanical stress]]. This might either be caused by a reconfiguration of the dipole-inducing surrounding or by re-orientation of molecular dipole moments under the influence of the external stress. Piezoelectricity may then manifest in a variation of the polarization strength, its direction or both, with the details depending on: 1. the orientation of '''''P''''' within the crystal; 2. [[crystal symmetry]]; and 3. the applied mechanical stress. The change in '''''P''''' appears as a variation of surface [[charge density]] upon the crystal faces, i.e. as a variation of the [[electric field]] extending between the faces caused by a change in dipole density in the bulk. For example, a 1&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; cube of quartz with 2&amp;nbsp;kN (500&amp;nbsp;lbf) of correctly applied force can produce a voltage of 12500 [[Volt|V]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://machinedesign.com/article/sensor-sense-piezoelectric-force-sensors-0207 Sensor Sense: Piezoelectric Force Sensors] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100413205918/http://machinedesign.com/article/sensor-sense-piezoelectric-force-sensors-0207 |date=2010-04-13 }}. Machinedesign.com (2008-02-07). Retrieved on 2012-05-04.&lt;/ref&gt;

Piezoelectric materials also show the opposite effect, called the '''converse piezoelectric effect''', where the application of an electrical field creates mechanical deformation in the crystal.

===Mathematical description===
Linear piezoelectricity is the combined effect of
* The linear electrical behavior of the material:
: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{D} = \boldsymbol{\varepsilon}\,\mathbf{E} \quad \implies \quad D_i = \varepsilon_{ij}\,E_j \;&lt;/math&gt;
: where ''D'' is the electric charge density displacement ([[electric displacement]]), ''ε'' is [[permittivity]] (free-body dielectric constant), ''E'' is [[electric field strength]], and &lt;math&gt; \nabla\cdot\mathbf{D} = 0 \,\,,\, \nabla \times \mathbf{E} = \mathbf{0} &lt;/math&gt;.
* [[Hooke's Law]] for linear elastic materials:
:&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{S}=\mathsf{s}\,\boldsymbol{T} \quad \implies \quad S_{ij} = s_{ijkl}\,T_{kl}\;&lt;/math&gt;
: where ''S'' is [[Strain (materials science)|strain]], ''s'' is [[Compliance (mechanics)|compliance]] under short-circuit conditions, ''T'' is [[Stress (physics)|stress]], and
:&lt;math&gt; \nabla \cdot \boldsymbol{T} = \mathbf{0} \,\,,\, \boldsymbol{S} = \frac{\nabla \mathbf{u} + \mathbf{u} \nabla}{2} &lt;/math&gt;.

These may be combined into so-called ''[[coupled equation]]s'', of which the '''strain-charge form''' is:&lt;ref name=ikeda&gt;{{cite book|title=Fundamentals of piezoelectricity|last=Ikeda|first=T.|year=1996|publisher=Oxford University Press}}{{ISBN missing}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
 \begin{align}
 \boldsymbol{S} &amp;= \mathsf{s}\,\boldsymbol{T} + \mathfrak{d}^t\,\mathbf{E} \quad \implies \quad
 S_{ij} = s_{ijkl}\,T_{kl} + d_{kij}\,E_k \\
 \mathbf{D} &amp;= \mathfrak{d}\,\boldsymbol{T} + \boldsymbol{\varepsilon}\,\mathbf{E} \quad \implies \quad
 D_i = d_{ijk}\,T_{jk} + \varepsilon_{ij}\,E_j \,.
 \end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
In matrix form,
:&lt;math&gt;
 \begin{align}
 \{S\} &amp;= \left [s^E \right ]\{T\}+[d^\mathrm{t}]\{E\} \\
 \{D\} &amp;= [d]\{T\}+\left [ \varepsilon^T \right ] \{E\} \,,
 \end{align}

where [''d''] is the matrix for the direct piezoelectric effect and [''d''{{i sup|t}}] is the matrix for the converse piezoelectric effect. The superscript ''E'' indicates a zero, or constant, electric field; the superscript ''T'' indicates a zero, or constant, stress field; and the superscript t stands for [[Transpose|transposition]] of a [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrix]].

Notice that the third order tensor &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{d}&lt;/math&gt; maps vectors into symmetric matrices. There are no non-trivial rotation-invariant tensors that have this property, which is why there are no isotropic piezoelectric materials.

The strain-charge for a material of the [[Tetragonal crystal system|4mm]] (C&lt;sub&gt;4v&lt;/sub&gt;) [[crystal system|crystal class]] (such as a poled piezoelectric ceramic such as tetragonal PZT or BaTiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) as well as the [[Hexagonal crystal system#Hexagonal crystal system|6mm]] crystal class may also be written as (ANSI IEEE 176):

where the first equation represents the relationship for the converse piezoelectric effect and the latter for the direct piezoelectric effect.&lt;ref name="DD1998"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Damjanovic |first=Dragan |year=1998 |title=Ferroelectric, dielectric and piezoelectric properties of ferroelectric thin films and ceramics |journal=Reports on Progress in Physics |volume=61 |pages=1267–1324 |doi=10.1088/0034-4885/61/9/002|bibcode = 1998RPPh...61.1267D |issue=9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the above equations are the most used form in literature, some comments about the notation are necessary. Generally, ''D'' and ''E'' are [[Vector (geometric)|vectors]], that is, [[Cartesian tensor]]s of rank 1; and permittivity ''ε'' is a Cartesian tensor of rank 2. Strain and stress are, in principle, also rank-2 [[tensors]]. But conventionally, because strain and stress are all symmetric tensors, the subscript of strain and stress can be relabeled in the following fashion: 11&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;1; 22&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;2; 33&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;3; 23&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;4; 13&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;5; 12&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;6. (Different conventions may be used by different authors in literature. For example, some use 12&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;4; 23&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;5; 31&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;6 instead.) That is why ''S'' and ''T'' appear to have the "vector form" of six components. Consequently, ''s'' appears to be a 6-by-6 matrix instead of a rank-3 tensor. Such a relabeled notation is often called [[Voigt notation]]. Whether the shear strain components ''S''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, ''S''&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;, ''S''&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; are tensor components or engineering strains is another question. In the equation above, they must be engineering strains for the 6,6 coefficient of the compliance matrix to be written as shown, i.e., 2(''s''{{su|b=11|p=''E''}}&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''s''{{su|b=12|p=''E''}}). Engineering shear strains are double the value of the corresponding tensor shear, such as ''S''&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2''S''&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; and so on. This also means that ''s''&lt;sub&gt;66&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;{{sfrac|1|''G''&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;}}, where ''G''&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; is the shear modulus.

In total, there are four piezoelectric coefficients, ''d&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''e&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''g&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt;'', and ''h&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt;'' defined as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
d_{ij} &amp;= \left ( \frac{\partial D_i}{\partial T_j} \right )^E
&amp;&amp;= \left ( \frac{\partial S_j}{\partial E_i} \right )^T \\
e_{ij} &amp;= \left ( \frac{\partial D_i}{\partial S_j} \right )^E
&amp;&amp;= -\left ( \frac{\partial T_j}{\partial E_i} \right )^S \\
g_{ij} &amp;= -\left ( \frac{\partial E_i}{\partial T_j} \right )^D

h_{ij} &amp;= -\left ( \frac{\partial E_i}{\partial S_j} \right )^D
&amp;&amp;= -\left ( \frac{\partial T_j}{\partial D_i} \right )^S \\

where the first set of four terms corresponds to the direct piezoelectric effect and the second set of four terms corresponds to the converse piezoelectric effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kochervinskii |first=V. |year=2003 |title=Piezoelectricity in Crystallizing Ferroelectric Polymers |journal=Crystallography Reports |volume=48 |issue= 4 |pages=649–675|doi=10.1134/1.1595194|bibcode = 2003CryRp..48..649K }}&lt;/ref&gt; For those piezoelectric crystals for which the polarization is of the crystal-field induced type, a formalism has been worked out that allows for the calculation of piezoelectrical coefficients ''d&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt;'' from electrostatic lattice constants or higher-order [[Madelung constant]]s.&lt;ref name="ZPB1995a"/&gt;

==Crystal classes==

[[Image:Capacitor schematic with dielectric.svg|thumb|Any spatially separated charge will result in an [[electric field]], and therefore an [[electric potential]]. Shown here is a standard dielectric in a [[capacitor]]. In a piezoelectric device, mechanical stress, instead of an externally applied voltage, causes the charge separation in the individual atoms of the material.]]

Of the 32 [[crystal class]]es, 21 are non-[[centrosymmetric]] (not having a centre of symmetry), and of these, 20 exhibit direct piezoelectricity&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Piezoelectric Crystal Classes|url=https://www.staff.ncl.ac.uk/j.p.goss/symmetry/PP_Piezo.html|publisher=Newcastle University, UK|accessdate=8 March 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402160441/https://www.staff.ncl.ac.uk/j.p.goss/symmetry/PP_Piezo.html|archivedate=2 April 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; (the 21st is the cubic class 432). Ten of these represent the polar crystal classes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pyroelectric Crystal Classes|url=https://www.staff.ncl.ac.uk/j.p.goss/symmetry/PP_Pyro.html|publisher=Newcastle University, UK|accessdate=8 March 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402183459/https://www.staff.ncl.ac.uk/j.p.goss/symmetry/PP_Pyro.html|archivedate=2 April 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which show a spontaneous polarization without mechanical stress due to a non-vanishing electric dipole moment associated with their unit cell, and which exhibit [[pyroelectricity]]. If the dipole moment can be reversed by applying an external electric field, the material is said to be [[ferroelectric]].
*Polar crystal classes: 1, 2, m, mm2, 4, {{Not a typo|4mm}}, 3, 3m, 6, {{Not a typo|6mm}}.
*Piezoelectric crystal classes: 1, 2, m, 222, mm2, 4, {{overline|4}}, 422, {{Not a typo|4mm}}, {{overline|4}}2m, 3, 32, 3m, 6, {{overline|6}}, 622, {{Not a typo|6mm}}, {{overline|6}}2m, 23, {{overline|4}}3m.

For polar crystals, for which '''''P'''''&amp;nbsp;≠&amp;nbsp;0 holds without applying a mechanical load, the piezoelectric effect manifests itself by changing the magnitude or the direction of '''''P''''' or both.

For the nonpolar but piezoelectric crystals, on the other hand, a polarization '''''P''''' different from zero is only elicited by applying a mechanical load. For them the stress can be imagined to transform the material from a nonpolar crystal class ('''''P'''''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0) to a polar one,&lt;ref name="ZPB1995a"/&gt; having '''''P'''''&amp;nbsp;≠&amp;nbsp;0.

Many materials, both natural and synthetic, exhibit piezoelectricity:

===Naturally occurring crystals===
*[[Quartz]]
*[[Berlinite]] (AlPO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;), a rare [[phosphate]] [[mineral]] that is structurally identical to quartz
*[[Sucrose]] (table sugar)
*[[Potassium sodium tartrate|Rochelle salt]]
*[[Topaz]]
*[[Tourmaline|Tourmaline-group minerals]]
*[[Lead titanate]] (PbTiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;). Although it occurs in nature as mineral macedonite,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Radusinović |first1=Dušan |last2=Markov |first2=Cvetko |lastauthoramp=yes |year=1971 |title=Macedonite – lead titanate: a new mineral |journal=American Mineralogist |volume=56 |pages=387–394 |url=http://www.minsocam.org/ammin/AM56/AM56_387.pdf |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305091225/http://www.minsocam.org/ammin/AM56/AM56_387.pdf |archivedate=2016-03-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Burke |first1=E.

The action of piezoelectricity in Topaz can probably be attributed to ordering of the (F,OH) in its lattice, which is otherwise centrosymmetric: orthorhombic bipyramidal (mmm). Topaz has anomalous optical properties which are attributed to such ordering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Akizuki |first1=Mizuhiko |first2=Martin S. |last2=Hampar |first3=Jack |last3=Zussman |year=1979|title=An explanation of anomalous optical properties of topaz|journal= Mineralogical Magazine |volume=43|pages= 237–241|url=http://rruff.geo.arizona.edu/doclib/MinMag/Volume_43/43-326-237.pdf|doi=10.1180/minmag.1979.043.326.05|issue=326|bibcode=1979MinM...43..237A}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bone===
Dry [[bone]] exhibits some piezoelectric properties. Studies of Fukada ''et al.'' showed that these are not due to the [[apatite]] crystals, which are centrosymmetric, thus non-piezoelectric, but due to [[collagen]]. Collagen exhibits the polar uniaxial orientation of molecular dipoles in its structure and can be considered as bioelectret, a sort of dielectric material exhibiting quasipermanent space charge and dipolar charge. Potentials are thought to occur when a number of collagen molecules are stressed in the same way displacing significant numbers of the charge carriers from the inside to the surface of the specimen. Piezoelectricity of single individual collagen fibrils was measured using piezoresponse force microscopy, and it was shown that collagen fibrils behave predominantly as shear piezoelectric materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |volume=20 |year=2009|page=085706|last1=Minary-Jolandan |first1=M. |last2=Yu |first2=Min-Feng |lastauthoramp=yes |journal=Nanotechnology |doi=10.1088/0957-4484/20/8/085706 |pmid=19417467 |title=Nanoscale characterization of isolated individual type I collagen fibrils: Polarization and piezoelectricity |issue=8|bibcode = 2009Nanot..20h5706M }}&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Tooth enamel|Enamel]]
*[[Dentin]]
*[[DNA]]

===Synthetic crystals===

===Synthetic ceramics===
[[Image:Perovskite.svg|thumb|Tetragonal unit cell of lead titanate]]
Ceramics with randomly oriented grains must be ferroelectric to exhibit piezoelectricity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=B. |last1=Jaffe |first2=W. R. |last2=Cook |first3=H. |last3=Jaffe |title=Piezoelectric Ceramics |location=New York |publisher=Academic |date=1971}}{{ISBN missing}}&lt;/ref&gt; The macroscopic piezoelectricity is possible in textured polycrystalline non-ferroelectric piezoelectric materials, such as AlN and ZnO. 
The family of ceramics with [[Perovskite (structure)|perovskite]], [[tungsten]]-[[bronze]] and related structures exhibits piezoelectricity:
*[[Barium titanate]] (BaTiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)—Barium titanate was the first piezoelectric ceramic discovered.
*[[Lead zirconate titanate]] ([[Lead|Pb]]&lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;{{zirconium|''x''}}{{titanium|1−''x''}}&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;{{oxygen|3}} with 0&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;''x''&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;1)—more commonly known as PZT, lead zirconate titanate is the most common piezoelectric ceramic in use today.
*[[Potassium niobate]] (KNbO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)
*[[Sodium tungstate]] (Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;WO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)
*Ba&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;NaNb&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;
*Pb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;KNb&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;15&lt;/sub&gt;
*[[Zinc oxide]] (ZnO)–[[Wurtzite crystal structure|Wurtzite structure]]. While single crystals of ZnO are piezoelectric and pyroelectric, polycrystalline (ceramic) ZnO with randomly oriented grains exhibits neither piezoelectric nor pyroelectric effect. Not being ferroelectric, polycrystalline ZnO cannot be poled like barium titanate or PZT. Ceramics and polycrystalline thin films of ZnO may exhibit macroscopic piezoelectricity and pyroelectricity only if they are [[Texture (crystalline)|textured]] (grains are preferentially oriented), such that the piezoelectric and pyroelectric responses of all individual grains do not cancel. This is readily accomplished in polycrystalline thin films.&lt;ref name="DD1998" /&gt;

===Lead-free piezoceramics===
More recently, there is growing concern regarding the toxicity in lead-containing devices driven by the result of [[restriction of hazardous substances directive]] regulations. To address this concern, there has been a resurgence in the compositional development of lead-free piezoelectric materials.
*Sodium potassium niobate ((K,Na)NbO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;). This material is also known as NKN. In 2004, a group of Japanese researchers led by Yasuyoshi Saito discovered a sodium potassium niobate composition with properties close to those of PZT, including a high ''T''&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Lead-free piezoceramics |first=Yasuyoshi |last=Saito |last2=Takao |first2=Hisaaki |last3=Tanil |first3=Toshihiko |last4=Nonoyama |first4=Tatsuhiko |last5=Takatori |first5=Kazumasa |last6=Homma |first6=Takahiko |last7=Nagaya |first7=Toshiatsu |last8=Nakamura |first8=Masaya |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |volume=432 |issue=7013 |pages=81–87 |doi=10.1038/nature03028 |pmid=15516921 |date=2004-11-04 |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v432/n7013/abs/nature03028.html |bibcode=2004Natur.432...84S |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081226225654/http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v432/n7013/abs/nature03028.html |archivedate=2008-12-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Certain compositions of this material have been shown to retain a high mechanical quality factor (''Q''&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;≈&amp;nbsp;900) with increasing vibration levels, whereas the mechanical quality factor of hard PZT degrades in such conditions. This fact makes NKN a promising replacement for high power resonance applications, such as piezoelectric transformers.&lt;ref name="GurdalUral2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gurdal|first1=Erkan A.|last2=Ural|first2=Seyit O.|last3=Park|first3=Hwi-Yeol|last4=Nahm|first4=Sahn|last5=Uchino|first5=Kenji|title=High Power (Na&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt;K&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt;)NbO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-Based Lead-Free Piezoelectric Transformer|journal=Japanese Journal of Applied Physics|volume=50|issue=2|year=2011|page=027101|issn=0021-4922|doi=10.1143/JJAP.50.027101|bibcode = 2011JaJAP..50b7101G }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Bismuth ferrite]] (BiFeO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) is also a promising candidate for the replacement of lead-based ceramics.
*Sodium niobate NaNbO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
*[[Barium titanate]] (BaTiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)—Barium titanate was the first piezoelectric ceramic discovered.
*[[Bismuth titanate]] Bi&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Ti&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;
*[[Sodium bismuth titanate]] NaBi(TiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
So far, neither the environmental effect nor the stability of supplying these substances have been measured.

===III–V and II–VI semiconductors===
A piezoelectric potential can be created in any bulk or nanostructured semiconductor crystal having non central symmetry, such as the Group III–V and II–VI materials, due to polarization of ions under applied stress and strain. This property is common to both the [[zincblende]] and [[wurtzite]] crystal structures. To first order, there is only one independent piezoelectric coefficient in [[zincblende]], called e&lt;sub&gt;14&lt;/sub&gt;, coupled to shear components of the strain. In [[wurtzite]], there are instead three independent piezoelectric coefficients: ''e''&lt;sub&gt;31&lt;/sub&gt;, ''e''&lt;sub&gt;33&lt;/sub&gt; and ''e''&lt;sub&gt;15&lt;/sub&gt;.
The semiconductors where the strongest piezoelectricity is observed are those commonly found in the [[wurtzite]] structure, i.e. GaN, InN, AlN and ZnO. ZnO is the most used material in the recent field of [[piezotronics]].

Since 2006, there have also been a number of reports of strong [[non linear piezoelectric effects in polar semiconductors]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=A Review of Non Linear Piezoelectricity in Semiconductors |first=Max |last=Migliorato |journal=AIP Conf Proc|volume=1590 |issue=N/A |pages=32–41 |doi=10.1063/1.4870192|display-authors=etal|series=AIP Conference Proceedings |year=2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Such effects are generally recognized to be at least important if not of the same order of magnitude as the first order approximation.

===Polymers===

The piezo-response of [[Polymer|polymers]] is not as high as the response for ceramics; however, polymers hold properties that ceramics don't. Over the last few decades, non-toxic, piezoelectric polymers have been studied and applied due to their flexibility and smaller [[Acoustic impedance|acoustical impedance]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/304563111|title=Piezoelectricity : evolution and future of a technology|date=2008|publisher=Springer|others=Heywang, Walter., Lubitz, Karl., Wersing, Wolfram.|isbn=9783540686835|location=Berlin|oclc=304563111}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other properties that make these materials significant include their [[biocompatibility]], [[Biodegradation|biodegradability]], low cost, and low power consumption compared to other piezo-materials (ceramics, etc.).&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sappati|first=Kiran|last2=Bhadra|first2=Sharmistha|last3=Sappati|first3=Kiran Kumar|last4=Bhadra|first4=Sharmistha|date=2018|title=Piezoelectric Polymer and Paper Substrates: A Review|url=https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/18/11/3605|journal=Sensors|language=en|volume=18|issue=11|pages=3605|doi=10.3390/s18113605}}&lt;/ref&gt; Piezoelectric polymers and non-toxic polymer composites can be used given their different physical properties.

Piezoelectric polymers can be classified by bulk polymers, voided charged polymers, and polymer composites. A piezo-response observed by bulk polymers is mostly due to its molecular structure. There are two types of bulk polymers: [[Amorphous solid|amorphous]] and [[Semi-crystalline polymer|semi-crystalline]]. Examples of semi-crystalline polymers are [[Polyvinylidene fluoride|Polyvinylidene Fluoride]] (PVDF) and its [[Copolymer|copolymers]], [[Polyamide|Polyamides]], and Paralyne-C. Non-crystalline polymers, such as [[Polyimide]] and [[Polyvinylidene chloride|Polyvinylidene Chloride]] (PVDC), fall under amorphous bulk polymers. Voided charged polymers exhibit the piezoelectric effect due to charge induced by poling of a porous polymeric film. Under an electric field, charges form on the surface of the voids forming dipoles. Electric responses can be caused by any deformation of these voids. The piezoelectric effect can also be observed in polymer composites by integrating piezoelectric ceramic particles into a polymer film. A polymer doesn’t have to be piezo-active to be an effective material for a polymer composite.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In this case, a material could be made up of an inert matrix with a separate piezo-active component.

PVDF exhibits piezoelectricity several times greater than quartz. The piezo-response observed from PVDF is about 20-30 pC/N. That is an order of 5-50 times less than that of piezoelectric ceramic lead zirconate titanate (PZT).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The thermal stability of the piezoelectric effect of polymers in the PVDF family (ie. vinylidene fluoride co-poly trifluoroethylene) goes up to 125°C. Some applications of PVDF are pressure sensors, hydrophones, and shock wave sensors.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Due to their flexibility, piezoelectric composites have been proposed as energy harvesters and nanogenerators. In 2018, it was reported by Zhu et al. that a piezoelectric response of about 17 pC/N could be obtained from PDMS/PZT nanocomposite at 60% porosity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ma|first=Si Wei|last2=Fan|first2=You Jun|last3=Li|first3=Hua Yang|last4=Su|first4=Li|last5=Wang|first5=Zhong Lin|last6=Zhu|first6=Guang|date=2018-09-07|title=Flexible Porous Polydimethylsiloxane/Lead Zirconate Titanate-Based Nanogenerator Enabled by the Dual Effect of Ferroelectricity and Piezoelectricity|url=https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsami.8b06696|journal=ACS Applied Materials &amp; Interfaces|language=en|volume=10|issue=39|pages=33105–33111|doi=10.1021/acsami.8b06696|issn=1944-8244}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another PDMS nanocomposite was reported in 2017, in which BaTiO3 was integrated into PDMS to make a stretchable, transparent nanogenerator for self-powered physiological monitoring.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chen|first=Xiaoliang|last2=Parida|first2=Kaushik|last3=Wang|first3=Jiangxin|last4=Xiong|first4=Jiaqing|last5=Lin|first5=Meng-Fang|last6=Shao|first6=Jinyou|last7=Lee|first7=Pooi See|date=2017-11-20|title=A Stretchable and Transparent Nanocomposite Nanogenerator for Self-Powered Physiological Monitoring|url=https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsami.7b13767|journal=ACS Applied Materials &amp; Interfaces|language=EN|volume=9|issue=48|pages=42200–42209|doi=10.1021/acsami.7b13767|issn=1944-8244}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, polar molecules were introduced into a polyurethane foam in which high responses of up to 244 pC/N were reported.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Moody|first=M. J.|last2=Marvin|first2=C. W.|last3=Hutchison|first3=G.

In 2000, it was shown that an actuator can be made of paper. The wood fibers, called [[Cellulose fiber|cellulose fibers]], are aligned so that there is a dipolar orientation. This allows the material to become piezoelectric. To enhance the effect, the material can be poled for further alignment.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; D33 responses for cellular polypropylene are around 200 pC/N. Some applications of cellular polypropylene are musical key pads, microphones, and ultrasound-based echolocation systems.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Organic nanostructures===
A strong shear piezoelectric activity was observed in self-assembled diphenylalanine peptide nanotubes (PNTs), indicating electric polarization directed along the tube axis. Comparison with LiNbO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and lateral signal calibration yields sufficiently high effective piezoelectric coefficient values of at least 60&amp;nbsp;pm/V (shear response for tubes of ≈200&amp;nbsp;nm in diameter). PNTs demonstrate linear deformation without irreversible degradation in a broad range of driving voltages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Strong Piezoelectricity in Bioinspired Peptide Nanotubes |first=Andrei |last=Kholkin |last2=Nadav |first2=Amdursky |last3=Igor |first3=Bdikin |last4=Ehud |first4=Gazit |last5= Gil |first5=Rosenman |journal=ACS Nano |volume=4 |issue=2 |pages=610–614 |doi=10.1021/nn901327v|pmid=20131852 |year=2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Application==

Currently, industrial and manufacturing is the largest application market for piezoelectric devices, followed by the automotive industry. Strong demand also comes from medical instruments as well as information and telecommunications. The global demand for piezoelectric devices was valued at approximately US$14.8&amp;nbsp;billion in 2010. The largest material group for piezoelectric devices is piezoceramics, and piezopolymer is experiencing the fastest growth due to its low weight and small size.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Market Report: World Piezoelectric Device Market | publisher = Market Intelligence | url = http://www.acmite.com/market-reports/materials/world-piezoelectric-device-market-report.html | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110703061231/http://www.acmite.com/market-reports/materials/world-piezoelectric-device-market-report.html | archivedate = 2011-07-03 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Piezoelectric crystals are now used in numerous ways:

===High voltage and power sources===

Direct piezoelectricity of some substances, like quartz, can generate [[potential difference]]s of thousands of volts.

* The best-known application is the electric [[Lighter|cigarette lighter]]: pressing the button causes a spring-loaded hammer to hit a piezoelectric crystal, producing a sufficiently high-voltage electric current that flows across a small [[spark gap]], thus heating and igniting the gas. The portable sparkers used to ignite [[gas stove]]s work the same way, and many types of gas burners now have built-in piezo-based ignition systems.
* A similar idea is being researched by [[DARPA]] in the United States in a project called ''[[Energy Harvesting]]'', which includes an attempt to power battlefield equipment by piezoelectric generators embedded in [[soldier]]s' boots. However, these energy harvesting sources by association affect the body. DARPA's effort to harness 1–2&amp;nbsp;watts from continuous shoe impact while walking were abandoned due to the impracticality and the discomfort from the additional energy expended by a person wearing the shoes. Other energy harvesting ideas include harvesting the energy from human movements in train stations or other public places&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.treehugger.com/files/2006/08/japan_ticket_gates.php | title = Japan: Producing Electricity from Train Station Ticket Gates | last = Richard | first = Michael Graham | website = TreeHugger | publisher = Discovery Communications, LLC | date = 2006-08-04 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070709200844/http://www.treehugger.com/files/2006/08/japan_ticket_gates.php | archivedate = 2007-07-09 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/2007/crowdfarm-0725.html | title = MIT duo sees people-powered "Crowd Farm" | last = Wright | first = Sarah H. | date = 2007-07-25 | website = MIT news | publisher = [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070912201419/http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/2007/crowdfarm-0725.html | archivedate = 2007-09-12 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; and converting a dance floor to generate electricity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://abcnews.go.com/International/story?id=5358214&amp;page=1 | title = How to Save the World One Dance at a Time | last = Kannampilly | first = Ammu | publisher = ABC News | date = 2008-07-11 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20101031010929/http://abcnews.go.com/International/story?id=5358214&amp;page=1 | archivedate = 2010-10-31 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Vibrations from industrial machinery can also be harvested by piezoelectric materials to charge batteries for backup supplies or to power low-power microprocessors and wireless radios.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.linear.com/docs/29984 |title=True Grid Independence: Robust Energy Harvesting System for Wireless Sensors Uses Piezoelectric Energy Harvesting Power Supply and Li-Poly Batteries with Shunt Charger |last=Barbehenn |first=George H. |page=36 |date=October 2010 |journal=Journal of Analog Innovation}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A piezoelectric [[transformer]] is a type of AC voltage multiplier. Unlike a conventional transformer, which uses magnetic coupling between input and output, the piezoelectric transformer uses [[acoustic coupling]]. An input voltage is applied across a short length of a bar of piezoceramic material such as [[Lead zirconate titanate|PZT]], creating an alternating stress in the bar by the inverse piezoelectric effect and causing the whole bar to vibrate. The vibration frequency is chosen to be the [[resonance|resonant]] frequency of the block, typically in the 100&amp;nbsp;[[kilohertz]] to 1&amp;nbsp;megahertz range. A higher output voltage is then generated across another section of the bar by the piezoelectric effect. Step-up ratios of more than 1,000:1 have been demonstrated.{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}} An extra feature of this transformer is that, by operating it above its resonant frequency, it can be made to appear as an [[inductor|inductive]] load, which is useful in circuits that require a controlled soft start.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.eetimes.com/electronics-news/4197064/Piezoelectric-Technology-A-Primer | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20101006002651/http://www.eetimes.com/electronics-news/4197064/Piezoelectric-Technology-A-Primer | archivedate = 2010-10-06 | title = Piezoelectric Technology: A Primer | last = Phillips | first = James R. | date = 2000-08-10 | website = eeProductCenter | publisher = TechInsights }}&lt;/ref&gt; These devices can be used in DC–AC inverters to drive [[cold cathode fluorescent lamp]]s. Piezo transformers are some of the most compact high voltage sources.

===Sensors===

{{main article|Piezoelectric sensor}}
The principle of operation of a piezoelectric [[sensor]] is that a physical dimension, transformed into a force, acts on two opposing faces of the sensing element. Depending on the design of a sensor, different "modes" to load the piezoelectric element can be used: longitudinal, transversal and shear.

Detection of pressure variations in the form of sound is the most common sensor application, e.g. piezoelectric [[microphone]]s (sound waves bend the piezoelectric material, creating a changing voltage) and piezoelectric [[Pick up (music technology)|pickup]]s for [[acoustic-electric guitar]]s. A piezo sensor attached to the body of an instrument is known as a [[contact microphone]].

Piezoelectric sensors especially are used with high frequency sound in ultrasonic transducers for medical imaging and also industrial [[nondestructive testing]] (NDT).

For many sensing techniques, the sensor can act as both a sensor and an actuator&amp;nbsp;– often the term ''transducer'' is preferred when the device acts in this dual capacity, but most piezo devices have this property of reversibility whether it is used or not. Ultrasonic transducers, for example, can inject ultrasound waves into the body, receive the returned wave, and convert it to an electrical signal (a voltage). Most medical ultrasound transducers are piezoelectric.

In addition to those mentioned above, various sensor applications include:

*Piezoelectric elements are also used in the detection and generation of sonar waves.
*Piezoelectric materials are used in single-axis and dual-axis tilt sensing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Moubarak | first1 = P. | display-authors = etal | year = 2012 | title = A Self-Calibrating Mathematical Model for the Direct Piezoelectric Effect of a New MEMS Tilt Sensor | url = | journal = IEEE Sensors Journal | volume = 12 | issue = 5| pages = 1033–1042 | doi=10.1109/jsen.2011.2173188| bibcode = 2012ISenJ..12.1033M}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Power monitoring in high power applications (e.g. medical treatment, [[sonochemistry]] and industrial processing).
*[[Piezoelectric microbalance]]s are used as very sensitive chemical and biological sensors.
*Piezos are sometimes used in [[strain gauge]]s.
*A piezoelectric transducer was used in the penetrometer instrument on the [[Huygens Probe]].
*Piezoelectric [[transducers]] are used in [[electronic drum|electronic drum pads]] to detect the impact of the drummer's sticks, and to detect muscle movements in medical [[acceleromyography]].
*Automotive [[Engine Control Unit|engine management systems]] use piezoelectric transducers to detect Engine knock (Knock Sensor, KS), also known as detonation, at certain hertz frequencies. A piezoelectric transducer is also used in fuel injection systems to measure manifold absolute pressure (MAP sensor) to determine engine load, and ultimately the fuel injectors milliseconds of on time.
*Ultrasonic piezo sensors are used in the detection of acoustic emissions in [[acoustic emission testing]].

===Actuators===

[[Image:2007-07-24 Piezoelectric buzzer.jpg|thumb|Metal disk with piezoelectric disk attached, used in a [[buzzer]].]]

As very high electric fields correspond to only tiny changes in the width of the crystal, this width can be changed with better-than-[[micrometre|µm]] precision, making piezo crystals the most important tool for positioning objects with extreme accuracy&amp;nbsp;— thus their use in [[actuators]].
Multilayer ceramics, using layers thinner than {{nowrap|100 µm}}, allow reaching high electric fields with voltage lower than {{nowrap|150 V}}. These ceramics are used within two kinds of actuators: direct piezo actuators and [[Amplified piezoelectric actuator]]s. While direct actuator's stroke is generally lower than {{nowrap|100 µm}}, amplified piezo actuators can reach millimeter strokes.
* [[Piezoelectric loudspeaker|Loudspeaker]]s: Voltage is converted to mechanical movement of a metallic diaphragm.
* [[Piezoelectric motor]]s: Piezoelectric elements apply a directional force to an [[axle]], causing it to rotate. Due to the extremely small distances involved, the piezo motor is viewed as a high-precision replacement for the [[stepper motor]].
* Piezoelectric elements can be used in [[laser]] mirror alignment, where their ability to move a large mass (the mirror mount) over microscopic distances is exploited to electronically align some laser mirrors. By precisely controlling the distance between mirrors, the laser electronics can accurately maintain optical conditions inside the laser cavity to optimize the beam output.
* A related application is the [[acousto-optic modulator]], a device that scatters light off soundwaves in a crystal, generated by piezoelectric elements. This is useful for fine-tuning a laser's frequency.
* [[Atomic force microscope]]s and [[scanning tunneling microscope]]s employ converse piezoelectricity to keep the sensing needle close to the specimen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter=The scanning mechanism for ROSETTA/MIDAS from an engineering model to the flight model |last=Le Letty|first=R.; Barillot, F.; Lhermet, N.; Claeyssen, F.; Yorck, M.; Gavira Izquierdo, J.; Arends, H. |bibcode=2001ESASP.480...75L |pages=75–81 |isbn=978-92-9092-761-7 |year=2001 |title=Proceedings of the 9th European Space Mechanisms and Tribology Symposium, 19–21 September 2001, Liège, Belgium |journal=9Th European Space Mechanisms and Tribology Symposium|editor-first=R.

* [[Crystal earpiece]]s are sometimes used in old or low power radios.
* [[High-intensity focused ultrasound]] for localized heating or creating a localized [[cavitation]] can be achieved, for example, in patient's body or in an industrial chemical process.
* [[Refreshable braille display]] A small crystal is expanded, by applying a current, that moves a lever to raise individual braille cells.

===Frequency standard===

The piezoelectrical properties of quartz are useful as a [[Frequency standard|standard of frequency]].

*[[Quartz clock]]s employ a [[crystal oscillator]] made from a quartz crystal that uses a combination of both direct and converse piezoelectricity to generate a regularly timed series of electrical pulses that is used to mark time. The quartz crystal (like any [[elasticity (physics)|elastic]] material) has a precisely defined natural frequency (caused by its shape and size) at which it prefers to [[oscillator|oscillate]], and this is used to stabilize the frequency of a periodic voltage applied to the crystal.
*The same principle is used in some [[radio]] [[transmitter]]s and [[receiver (radio)|receivers]], and in [[computer]]s where it creates a [[clock pulse]]. Both of these usually use a [[frequency multiplier]] to reach gigahertz ranges.

===Piezoelectric motors===
[[File:Slip-stick actuator operation.svg|thumb|A slip-stick actuator.]]
{{Main article|Piezoelectric motor}}
Types of piezoelectric motor include:
*The [[traveling-wave motor]] used for [[auto-focus]] in [[single lens reflex|reflex cameras]]
*[[Inchworm motor]]s for linear motion
*Rectangular four-quadrant motors with high power density (2.5&amp;nbsp;[[watt|W]]/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) and speed ranging from 10&amp;nbsp;nm/s to 800&amp;nbsp;mm/s.
*Stepping piezo motor, using [[stick-slip]] effect.

Aside from the stepping stick-slip motor, all these motors work on the same principle. Driven by dual orthogonal vibration modes with a [[phase (waves)|phase]] difference of 90°, the contact point between two surfaces vibrates in an [[ellipse|elliptical]] path, producing a [[friction]]al force between the surfaces. Usually, one surface is fixed, causing the other to move. In most piezoelectric motors, the piezoelectric crystal is excited by a [[sine wave]] signal at the resonant frequency of the motor. Using the resonance effect, a much lower voltage can be used to produce a high vibration amplitude.

A stick-slip motor works using the inertia of a mass and the friction of a clamp. Such motors can be very small. Some are used for camera sensor displacement, thus allowing an anti-shake function.

===Reduction of vibrations and noise===

Different teams of researchers have been investigating ways to reduce vibrations in materials by attaching piezo elements to the material. When the material is bent by a vibration in one direction, the vibration-reduction system responds to the bend and sends electric power to the piezo element to bend in the other direction. Future applications of this technology are expected in cars and houses to reduce noise. Further applications to flexible structures, such as shells and plates, have also been studied for nearly three decades.

In a demonstration at the Material Vision Fair in [[Frankfurt]] in November 2005, a team from [[Darmstadt University of Technology|TU Darmstadt]] in [[Germany]] showed several panels that were hit with a rubber mallet, and the panel with the piezo element immediately stopped swinging.

Piezoelectric ceramic fiber technology is being used as an electronic damping system on some [[Head (company)|HEAD]] [[tennis racket]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.head.com/tennis/technology.php?region=eu&amp;tag=intelligence |title=Isn't it amazing how one smart idea, one chip and an intelligent material has changed the world of tennis? |accessdate=2008-02-27 |publisher=HEAD |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070222224436/http://www.head.com/tennis/technology.php?region=eu&amp;tag=intelligence |archivedate=February 22, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Infertility treatment===
In people with previous [[total fertilization failure]], piezoelectric activation of oocytes together with [[intracytoplasmic sperm injection]] (ICSI) seems to improve fertilization outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The effectiveness of intracytoplasmic sperm injection combined with piezoelectric stimulation in infertile couples with total fertilization failure |journal=Fertil.

===Surgery===
A recent application of piezoelectric ultrasound sources is piezoelectric surgery, also known as [[piezosurgery]].&lt;ref name="Manbachi, A. and Cobbold R.S.C. 2011 187–196"/&gt; Piezosurgery is a minimally invasive technique that aims to cut a target tissue with little damage to neighboring tissues. For example, Hoigne ''et al.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hoigne |first1=D.J. |last2=Stubinger |first2=S. |last3=von Kaenel |first3=O. |last4=Shamdasani |first4=S. |last5=Hasenboehler |first5=P. |title=Piezoelectric osteotomy in hand surgery: first experiences with a new technique |journal=BMC Musculoskelet.

===Potential applications===
In 2015, Cambridge University researchers working in conjunction with researchers from the National Physical Laboratory and Cambridge-based dielectric antenna company Antenova Ltd, using thin films of piezoelectric materials found that at a certain frequency, these materials become not only efficient resonators, but efficient radiators as well, meaning that they can potentially be used as antennas. The researchers found that by subjecting the piezoelectric thin films to an asymmetric excitation, the symmetry of the system is similarly broken, resulting in a corresponding symmetry breaking of the electric field, and the generation of electromagnetic radiation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first1=Dhiraj|last1=Sinha|first2=Gehan|last2=Amaratunga|title=Electromagnetic Radiation Under Explicit symmetry Breaking|journal=Physical Review Letters|volume=114|issue=14|page=147701|year=2015|doi=10.1103/physrevlett.114.147701|pmid=25910163|bibcode = 2015PhRvL.114n7701S }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New understanding of electromagnetism could enable 'antennas on a chip'|url=http://www.cam.ac.uk/research/news/new-understanding-of-electromagnetism-could-enable-antennas-on-a-chip|website=cam.ac.uk|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304113152/http://www.cam.ac.uk/research/news/new-understanding-of-electromagnetism-could-enable-antennas-on-a-chip|archivedate=2016-03-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This working condition may eventually lead to low power generation efficiency.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Li|first1=Xiaofeng|last2=Strezov|first2=Vladimir|title=Modelling piezoelectric energy harvesting potential in an educational building|journal=Energy Conversion and Management|volume=85|pages=435–442|doi=10.1016/j.enconman.2014.05.096|year=2014|url=http://www.researchonline.mq.edu.au/vital/access/services/Download/mq:33352/DS01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In this case, locating high traffic areas is critical for optimization of the energy harvesting efficiency, as well as the orientation of the tile pavement significantly affects the total amount of the harvested energy. A density flow evaluation is recommended to qualitatively evaluate the piezoelectric power harvesting potential of the considered area based on the number of pedestrian crossings per unit time.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; In X. Li's study, the potential application of a commercial piezoelectric energy harvester in a central hub building at Macquarie University in Sydney, Australia is examined and discussed. Optimization of the piezoelectric tile deployment is presented according to the frequency of pedestrian mobility and a model is developed where 3.1% of the total floor area with the highest pedestrian mobility is paved with piezoelectric tiles. The modelling results indicate that the total annual energy harvesting potential for the proposed optimized tile pavement model is estimated at 1.1&amp;nbsp;MW&amp;nbsp;h/year, which would be sufficient to meet close to 0.5% of the annual energy needs of the building.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; In Israel, there is a company which has installed piezoelectric materials under a busy highway. The energy generated is adequate and powers street lights, billboards and signs.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

Tire company [[Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company|Goodyear]] has plans to develop an electricity generating tire which has piezoelectric material lined inside it. As the tire moves, it deforms and thus electricity is generated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Goodyear Is Trying to Make an Electricity-Generating Tire|url=https://www.wired.com/2015/03/goodyear-trying-make-electricity-generating-tire/|website=WIRED|accessdate=14 June 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160511070323/http://www.wired.com/2015/03/goodyear-trying-make-electricity-generating-tire|archivedate=11 May 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Photovoltaics====
The efficiency of a hybrid [[photovoltaic cell]] that contains piezoelectric materials can be increased simply by placing it near a source of ambient noise or vibration. The effect was demonstrated with organic cells using [[zinc oxide]] nanotubes. The electricity generated by the piezoelectric effect itself is a negligible percentage of the overall output. Sound levels as low as 75 decibels improved efficiency by up to 50%. Efficiency peaked at 10&amp;nbsp;kHz, the resonant frequency of the nanotubes. The electrical field set up by the vibrating nanotubes interacts with electrons migrating from the organic polymer layer. This process decreases the likelihood of recombination, in which electrons are energized but settle back into a hole instead of migrating to the electron-accepting ZnO layer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gizmag.com/vibration-sound-efficient-hybrid-solar-cell-arrays/29679/ |title=Good vibrations lead to efficient excitations in hybrid solar cells |publisher=Gizmag.com |accessdate=2013-11-11 |author=Heidi Hoopes |date=November 8, 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131111193548/http://www.gizmag.com/vibration-sound-efficient-hybrid-solar-cell-arrays/29679/ |archivedate=November 11, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Shoaee | first1 = S. | last2 = Briscoe | first2 = J. | last3 = Durrant | first3 = J.

==Early years==
Kline was born in the town of [[New Ringgold, Pennsylvania]] to Rev. Raymond Adam Kline and Marie (Herb). He, and his three sisters, were raised by their mother after their father died in 1936 from respiratory complications brought on by [[mustard gas]] exposure in [[World War I]]. Economic circumstances after Rev. Kline's death compelled the family to move to the [http://www.diakon.org/about-us/history/the-lutheran-home-at-topton/ Lutheran Orphans Home] in [[Topton, Pennsylvania|Topton, PA]]. Kline, along with his mother Marie and three sisters, Helen, Marguerite and Yvonne, lived for two years at the orphanage from 1938 to 1940. Kline attended [http://www.lebanon.k12.pa.us/high-school/ Lebanon High School] in [[Lebanon, Pennsylvania|Lebanon, PA]] from 1941 to 1944 where he was actively involved in academic clubs and sports. After graduating high school, Kline attended the [[Virginia Military Institute]] in the [http://www.vmi.edu/archives/genealogy-biography-alumni/vmi-alumni-in-the-military/vmi-and-world-war-ii/astp-during-world-war-ii/ Army Specialized Training Program] in 1944.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://archivesweb.vmi.edu/rosters/name.php?letter=K&amp;page=4|title=VMI Archives Historical Rosters: Browse by Name|last=TERMINALFOUR|website=archivesweb.vmi.edu|access-date=2017-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then volunteered in the [[U.S. Army]] during [[World War II]], serving in active duty as Staff Sergeant and platoon leader, 1st Division, [[26th Infantry Regiment]] in the European theater from 1944 to 1946.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://aad.archives.gov/aad/record-detail.jsp?dt=893&amp;mtch=19&amp;tf=F&amp;q=raymond+kline&amp;bc=&amp;sort=24983%20asc&amp;rpp=10&amp;pg=1&amp;rid=784970&amp;rlst=223382,1115467,784970,4400948,3099936,3891456,5973778,7134939,3724886,7094204|title=WWII Army Enlistment|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.fold3.com/page/83862661-raymond-a-kline|title=Raymond A Kline: person, pictures and information - Fold3.com|work=Fold3|access-date=2017-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://governmentattic.org/3docs/NPRC_VIP_List_2009.pdf|title=National Archives Military Records, Raymond A.

Bill]] and graduated with an A.B. degree in political science ([[Pi Gamma Mu]]). Kline was later recalled back to the U.S. Army during the [[Korean War]] and served in the [[Military Police Corps (United States)|Military Police Corps]] from 1950 to 1951. After his years in military service, Kline took on various jobs including working as a police officer in [[Ocean City, Maryland]]. Kline attended [https://www.programs.gwu.edu/graduate/public-administration George Washington University School of Public Administration] at night from 1952 to 1954 and fell short of his master's degree when he learned that his thesis topic had already been taken. His work and [[law school]] superseded efforts to complete the thesis. From 1954 to 1957, Kline attended [[George Washington University Law School]] and graduated with a LLB degree ([[Phi Delta Phi]]). The law degree fulfilled a promise that Kline made to his father just prior to his death. Kline was admitted to the [http://www.dcbar.org/ Bar of the District of Columbia] in 1958. In 1959, he was admitted to [[Federal Bar Association]]. He later received Honorary Doctor of Laws degrees from both [[George Washington University]] (1982) and Lebanon Valley College (1990).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/valleylebanon821990leba|title=Valley: Lebanon Valley College Magazine|last=Lebanon Valley College|date=1990|publisher=Lebanon Valley College|others=Vernon and Doris Bishop Library Lebanon Valley College}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Shala''' was an ancient [[Sumer]]ian goddess of grain and the emotion of compassion. The symbols of grain and compassion combine to reflect the importance of agriculture in the [[Sumerian mythology|mythology of Sumer]], and the belief that an abundant harvest was an act of compassion from the deities.&lt;ref name="Farrar"&gt;{{cite book |author=Stewart and Janet Farrar|title=''The Witches' Goddess: The Feminine Principle of Divinity''|publisher=Phoenix Publishing|year=1987|ISBN=978-0919345911|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=42EOOAAACAAJ&amp;dq=The+Witches%27+Goddess:+The+Feminine+Principle+of+Divinity+1987&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=AmmgVPHvIsmy7Qae6oD4Dg&amp;ved=0CCAQ6AEwAA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditions identify Shala as wife of the fertility god [[Dagon]], or consort of the storm god [[Hadad]]' also called Ishkur.&lt;ref name="Symbols"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jeremy Black and Anthony Green|title=''Gods, Demons and Symbols of Ancient Mesopotamia''|publisher=University of Texas Press|year=1992|ISBN=978-0-292-70794-8|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=pr8-i1iFnIQC&amp;dq=Gods,+Demons+and+Symbols+of+Ancient+Mesopotamia&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=RGugVJIhiJTtBritgNAO&amp;ved=0CCcQ6AEwAQ|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150103022312/https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=pr8-i1iFnIQC&amp;dq=Gods,+Demons+and+Symbols+of+Ancient+Mesopotamia&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=RGugVJIhiJTtBritgNAO&amp;ved=0CCcQ6AEwAQ|archivedate=2015-01-03|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ancient depictions, she carries a double-headed mace or scimitar embellished with lion heads.&lt;ref name="Jordan"&gt;{{cite book |author=Michael Jordan|title=''Encyclopedia of Gods''|publisher=Kyle Cathie Limited|year=2002|ISBN=978-1-85626-131-9|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ftUENQAACAAJ&amp;dq=Michael+Jordan,+Encyclopedia+of+Gods+2002&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=rmugVLWHAsGf7gaotYGwDg&amp;ved=0CCAQ6AEwAA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes she is depicted as being borne atop one or two lionesses.

'''Shell Processing Support''' ('''SPS''') is a set of formatted files used for exchanging Land 3D seismic data. They can also be used for 2D.

==History==
Shell Processing Support data format was initially defined and used by Shell Internationale Petroleum for transferring of seismic and positioning data to the processing centres. In 1993 [[Society of Exploration Geophysicists|SEG]] Technical standards committee on ancillary data formats adopted SPS as the standard format for exchanging Geophysical positioning data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1190/1.1443799 | title=Shell Processing Support Format for Land 3-D Surveys | author=Shell Internationale Petroleum Maatschappij B.V., The Hague, The Netherlands | journal=Geophysics |date=March–April 1995 | volume=60 | pages=596 | doi=10.1190/1.1443799}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==SPS Format==
SPS format is a set of three files called Receiver file, Source file, Cross reference file and an optional fourth file for comments. In addition to the comment file comments can be entered in each of the three files as part of the header and is indicated by starting with the letter H.

'''Receiver file''':
Receiver file contains the information about the geophones their type, position ([[Easting]], [[Northing]], [[Elevation]]) and their ID.

'''Source file''':
Source file contains the information about the [[Seismic source]] its position and their ID.

'''Cross reference file''':
Cross reference file (also known as relational file) or in short, X file, is basically a relational file relating the source and the receiver when the shot occurred. It contains the details about the Shot ID, Source and receivers associated with that particular shot ID.

'''Comment file''':
This file is an optional file. Any other information regarding the seismic acquisition can be provided in this file for the processing center. 

==Versions==
* The first version of SPS adopted by SEG is now referred to as SPS rev0
* The recent version of SPS is SPS rev2.1

'''Shittah tree'''&lt;ref&gt;Isaiah 41:19&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]: שטה) or the plural "[[shittim (disambiguation)|shittim]]" &lt;ref&gt;Exodus 25:10 &amp; 23, 26:15&lt;/ref&gt; was used in the [[Tanakh]] to refer to trees belonging to the genus ''[[Vachellia]]'' and the genus ''[[Faidherbia]]''. ''[[Faidherbia albida]]'', ''[[Vachellia seyal]]'', ''[[Vachellia tortilis]]'', and ''[[Vachellia gerrardii]]'' can be found growing wild in the [[Sinai peninsula|Sinai]] desert and the [[Jordan River|Jordan]] valley.

[[File:Trees and shrubs. Shittim tree at Engedi. (Ancacia Seyal Del.) LOC matpc.14961.tif|thumb|right|450|A Shittah tree]]

In [[the Exodus]], the ancient [[Israelites]] were commanded to use '''shittah wood''' to make various parts of the [[Tabernacle (Judaism)|Tabernacle]] and of the [[Ark of the Covenant]]. This was most likely the ''[[Acacia seyal]]''.{{fact|date=July 2017}}

"The wild acacia (''[[Vachellia nilotica]]''), under the name of ''sunt'', everywhere represents the ''seneh'', or ''senna'', of the [[burning bush]]. A slightly different form of the tree, equally common under the name of ''[[Vachellia seyal|seyal]]'', is the ancient ''shittah'', or, as more usually expressed in the plural form, the ''shittim'', of which the Tabernacle was made."&lt;ref&gt;[[Arthur Penrhyn Stanley]], ''Sinai and Palestine''.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{About|the current and future tropical cyclone lists|the history of naming|History of tropical cyclone naming|previously named storms|List of historical tropical cyclone names{{!}}Historical tropical cyclone names}}
{{Tropicalcyclone}}
[[Tropical cyclone]]s and [[subtropical cyclone]]s are named by various warning centers to provide ease of communication between forecasters and the general public regarding forecasts, watches, and warnings. The names are intended to reduce confusion in the event of concurrent storms in the same [[Tropical cyclone basins|basin]]. Generally once storms produce sustained wind speeds of more than {{convert|33|kn|km/h mph}}, names are assigned in order from predetermined lists depending on which basin they originate. However, standards vary from basin to basin: some tropical depressions are named in the Western Pacific, while tropical cyclones must have a significant amount of [[gale]]-force winds occurring around the centre before they are named in the [[Southern Hemisphere]].

Before the formal start of naming, tropical cyclones were named after places, objects, or saints' feast days on which they occurred. The credit for the first usage of personal names for weather systems is generally given to the [[Queensland Government]] Meteorologist [[Clement Wragge]], who named systems between 1887 and 1907. This system of naming weather systems subsequently fell into disuse for several years after Wragge retired, until it was revived in the latter part of [[World War II]] for the Western Pacific. Formal naming schemes and naming lists have subsequently been introduced and developed for the [[Pacific hurricane|Eastern, Central]], [[Typhoon|Western]] and [[South Pacific tropical cyclone|Southern Pacific]] basins, as well as the [[Australian region tropical cyclone|Australian region]], [[Atlantic Ocean]] and [[Indian Ocean]].

==Eastern Pacific Ocean==
{{see|List of retired Pacific hurricane names}}
[[File:Lane_2018-08-21_2350Z.jpg|thumb|180px|right|[[Hurricane Lane (2018)|Hurricane Lane]] near peak intensity in August 2018]]
Within the Eastern Pacific Ocean, there are two warning centers that assign names to tropical cyclones on behalf of the World Meteorological Organization when they are judged to have intensified into a tropical storm with winds of at least {{convert|34|kn|mph km/h|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="ATL/EPAC TCOP"/&gt; Tropical cyclones that intensify into tropical storms between the coast of Americas and 140°W are named by the National Hurricane Center (NHC/RSMC Miami), while tropical cyclones intensifying into tropical storms between 140°W and 180° are named by the Central Pacific Hurricane Center (CPHC/RSMC Honolulu).&lt;ref name="ATL/EPAC TCOP"/&gt; Significant tropical cyclones have their names retired from the lists and a replacement name selected at the next World Meteorological Organization Hurricane Committee.&lt;ref name="ATL/EPAC TCOP"/&gt;

The current naming scheme began with the [[1978 Pacific hurricane season|1978 season]], one year before the Atlantic basin (and which anomalously used the list that will be used next in 2018, rather than the one for 2020). As with the Atlantic basin, it uses alternating women's and men's names, and also includes some Spanish and a few French names. Before then, only women's names were used. Because Eastern Pacific hurricanes mainly threaten western Mexico and Central America, the lists contain more Spanish names than the Atlantic lists.

===North Pacific east of 140°W===
When a tropical depression intensifies into a tropical storm to the north of the Equator between the coastline of the Americas and 140°W, it will be named by the NHC. There are six lists of names which rotate every six years and begin with the letters A—Z used, skipping Q and U, with each name alternating between a male or a female name.&lt;ref name="ATL/EPAC TCOP"/&gt; The names of significant tropical cyclones are [[List of retired Pacific hurricane names|retired]] from the lists, with a replacement name selected at the next World Meteorological Organization's Hurricane Committee.&lt;ref name="ATL/EPAC TCOP"/&gt; If all of the names on a list are used, storms are named using the letters of the Greek alphabet.&lt;ref name="ATL/EPAC TCOP"/&gt;

[[File:Mangkhut_2018-09-12_0150Z.png|thumb|180px|right|[[Typhoon Mangkhut|Typhoon Mangkhut]]  at peak intensity in September 2018]]
Tropical cyclones that occur within the Northern Hemisphere between the [[180th meridian|anti-meridian]] and [[100th meridian east|100°E]] are officially named by the Japan Meteorological Agency when they become tropical storms.&lt;ref name="WPAC TCOP"/&gt; However, [[PAGASA]] also names tropical cyclones that occur or develop into tropical depressions within their self-defined area of responsibility between 5°N–25°N and 115°E-135°E.&lt;ref name="GMA"/&gt; This often results in tropical cyclones in the region having two names.&lt;ref name="GMA"/&gt;

===International names===
{{see|List of retired Pacific typhoon names}}
Tropical cyclones within the Western Pacific are assigned international names by the JMA when they become a tropical storm with 10-minute sustained winds of at least {{convert|34|kn|mph km/h|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="WPAC TCOP"/&gt; The names are used sequentially without regard to year and are taken from five lists of names that were prepared by the ESCAP/WMO Typhoon Committee, after each of the 14 members submitted 10 names in 1998.&lt;ref name="WPAC TCOP"/&gt; The order of the names to be used was determined by placing the English name of the members in alphabetical order.&lt;ref name="WPAC TCOP"/&gt; Members of the committee are allowed to request the [[List of retired Pacific typhoon names#Background|retirement or replacement]] of a system's name if it causes extensive destruction or for other reasons such as number of deaths.&lt;ref name="WPAC TCOP"/&gt; Unlike other basins, storms are also named after plants, animals, objects, and mythological beings.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4327">A '''tylosis''' (plural: '''tyloses''') is a bladder-like distension of a parenchyma cell into the lumen of adjacent vessels in wood. Less certainly, the term '''tylosis'''  is in use to summarise the physiological process and the resulting occlusion in the [[xylem]] of woody plants as response to injury or as protection from decay in heartwood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://encarta.msn.com/dictionary_561509079/tylosis.html|title=MSN online dictionary|accessdate=19 February 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100421031737/http://encarta.msn.com/dictionary_561509079/tylosis.html|archivedate=21 April 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
It is a key process in wall one of the [[Compartmentalization Of Decay In Trees]] (CODIT) and other woody plants.

==Anatomy==
Observed in section under a microscope, tyloses appear as balloon-like protrusions emanating from axial paratracheal [[parenchyma]] cells into xylem vessels through pits linking the two. In some types, there may be a distinct barrier between the tyloses emanating from the pits into the vessels, while they may be barely distinguishable in other cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Shigo|first=Alex L.|authorlink=Alex Shigo|title=Modern Arboriculture- A systems approach to the care of trees and their associates|edition=third (2003)|year=1991|isbn=0943563097 |pages=56–57}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role in compartmentalization==
Tylosis in [[Flowering plant|narrow vesseled plant]] vessels counteracts the axial spread of fungal [[hypha]]e and other pathogens by slowing down their vertical spread with a physical barrier. A similar process occurs in [[gymnosperm]]s, which block access to [[tracheid]]s by closing the pits that join them to each other.&lt;ref name=Weber&gt;{{cite book|last1=Weber|first1=K.|last2=Mattheck|first2=C.|title=Manual of wood decays in trees|year=2003|publisher=The Arboricultural Association|location=Romsey, Hampshire|isbn=0-900978-35-X|pages=27–28}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The blocked vessels also provide a defense against the radial spread of pathogens, limiting their horizontal spread through the plant stem. Protection is stronger at the boundaries where [[Dendrochronology|annual rings]] meet.

The effectiveness of both vertical and horizontal barriers is affected by the speed at which they are established by tyloses, being typically faster in healthier plants.&lt;ref name=Weber/&gt;

==Role in heartwood formation==
As a tree grows, its [[Cambium (botany)|cambium]] adds an annual increment (or ring) of new wood, and in many species of trees the older wood towards the centre of the tree becomes less important for physiological processes like water and nutrient transportation, and this is converted by the tree to [[heartwood]]. This [[heartwood]] has no active defenses against infection, but is protected from infection and decay by the blockage of the xylem vessels with tyloses and various substances such as gums, [[resin]]s and waxes containing high concentrations of [[volatile organic compound]]s such as [[terpene]]s that are toxic to insect larvae and tree pathogens such as bacteria and fungi. These products are produced by the cambium and transported to the centre of the stem by cellular structures called [[Medullary ray (botany)|medullary rays]] radiating from the center of the stem &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Page |first=Jake|author2=Editors of Time-Life Books |title=Forest|series=Planet Earth|year=1983|publisher=Time-Life Books, Amsterdam|isbn=0 7054 0752 7|page=176}}&lt;/ref&gt; and then enter living axial paratracheal [[parenchyma]] cells. As the wood ages, the contents of the parenchyma cell burst into the dead vessel through the pit linking the two. The parenchyma cell then dies as its contents are disgorged into the empty space of the dry vessel and highly effective decay-inhibiting substances, notably tannin, are formed and absorbed by the adjacent vessel walls.
