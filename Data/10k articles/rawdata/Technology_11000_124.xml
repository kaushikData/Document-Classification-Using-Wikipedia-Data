      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19580">'''Acoustical engineering''' (also known as '''acoustic engineering''') is the branch of [[engineering]] dealing with [[sound]] and [[oscillation|vibration]]. It is the application of [[acoustics]], the science of sound and vibration, in technology. Acoustical engineers are typically concerned with the design, analysis and control of sound.

One goal of acoustical engineering can be the reduction of unwanted noise, which is referred to as [[noise control]]. Unwanted noise can have significant impacts on animal and human health and well-being, reduce attainment by pupils in schools, and cause hearing loss.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite book|last=World Health Organisation|title=Burden of disease from  environmental noise|year=2011|publisher=WHO|isbn=978 92 890 0229 5|url=http://www.euro.who.int/__data/assets/pdf_file/0008/136466/e94888.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Noise control]] principles are implemented into technology and design in a variety of ways, including control by redesigning sound sources, the design of noise barriers, sound absorbers, suppressors, and buffer zones, and the use of hearing protection ([[earmuffs]] or [[earplug]]s).

[[Image:Hamer Hall equipment detail.jpg|right|thumb|The transparent [[sound baffle|baffle]]s inside this auditorium were installed to optimise sound projection and reproduction, key factors in acoustical engineering.]]

But acoustical engineering is not just about [[noise control]]; it also covers positive uses of sound, from the use of [[ultrasound]] in medicine to the programming of digital sound [[synthesizer]]s, and from designing a concert hall to enhance the sound of an orchestra&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Barron|first=Michael|title=Auditorium Acoustics and Architectural Design|year=2009|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-0419245100}}&lt;/ref&gt; to specifying a railway station's sound system so announcements are [[Intelligibility (communication)|intelligible]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ahnert|first=Wolfgang|title=Sound Reinforcement Engineering: Fundamentals and Practice|year=2000|isbn=978-0415238700}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Acoustic engineer (professional) {{anchor|acoustic engineer}} ==

Acoustic engineers usually possess a [[bachelor's degree]] or higher qualification in [[acoustics]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last= Education in acoustics |title= MSc Engineering Acoustics, DTU |url=http://www.dtu.dk/english/Education/msc/Programmes/engineering_acoustics|accessdate=9 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[physics]] or another [[engineering]] discipline. Practicing as an acoustic engineer usually requires a [[bachelor's degree]] with significant scientific and mathematical content. Acoustic engineers might work in acoustic consultancy, specializing in particular fields, such as [[architectural acoustics]], [[environmental noise]] or [[vibration control]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=National Careers Service|title=Job profiles: Acoustics consultant|url=https://nationalcareersservice.direct.gov.uk/advice/planning/jobprofiles/Pages/acousticsconsultant.aspx|accessdate=13 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other industries, acoustic engineers might: design [[automobile]] sound systems; investigate human response to sounds, such as urban soundscapes and domestic appliances; develop audio signal processing software for mixing desks, and design loudspeakers and microphones for mobile phones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=University of Salford|title=Graduate Jobs in Acoustics|url=http://www.acoustics.salford.ac.uk/careers/index.php?content=roles|accessdate=13 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Acoustical Society of America|title=Acoustics and You|url=http://acousticalsociety.org/education_outreach/careers_in_acoustics|accessdate=13 May 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170308225726/http://acousticalsociety.org/education_outreach/careers_in_acoustics|archive-date=2017-03-08|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Acousticians are also involved in researching and understanding sound scientifically. Some positions, such as [[faculty (academic staff)|faculty]] require a [[Doctor of Philosophy]].

In most countries, a degree in [[acoustics]] can represent the first step towards [[professional certification]] and the degree program may be certified by a [[professional body]]. After completing a certified degree program the engineer must satisfy a range of requirements before being certified. Once certified, the engineer is designated the title of [[Chartered Engineer]] (in most [[Commonwealth]] countries).

==Subdisciplines==

The listed subdisciplines are loosely based on the PACS ([[Physics and Astronomy Classification Scheme]]) coding used by the [[Acoustical Society of America]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Acoustical Society of America|title=PACS 2010 Regular Edition—Acoustics Appendix|url=http://www.aip.org/pacs/pacs2010/individuals/pacs2010_regular_edition/reg_acoustics_appendix.htm|accessdate=22 May 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130514111126/http://www.aip.org/pacs/pacs2010/individuals/pacs2010_regular_edition/reg_acoustics_appendix.htm|archive-date=2013-05-14|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aeroacoustics===
{{main|Aeroacoustics}}

[[Aeroacoustics]] is concerned with how noise is generated by the movement of air, for instance via turbulence, and how sound propagates through the fluid air. Aeroacoustics plays an important role in understanding how noise is generated by [[aircraft]] and [[wind turbine]]s, as well as exploring how [[wind instrument|wind]] [[musical instrument]]s work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=da Silva|first=Andrey Ricardo|title=Aeroacoustics of Wind Instruments: Investigations and Numerical Methods|year=2009|publisher=VDM Verlag|isbn=978-3639210644}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Audio signal processing===
{{main|Audio signal processing}}

[[Audio signal processing]] is the electronic manipulation of audio signals using [[Analog signal processing|analog]] and [[digital signal processing]].

[[Audio signal processing]] is done for a variety of reasons such as:
* to enhance a sound, for instance by applying an audio effect such as [[reverberation]];
* to remove unwanted noises from a signal, for instance [[echo cancellation]] on [[Skype]];
* to compress an audio signal to allow efficient transmission, e.g. perceptual coding in [[MP3]] and [[Opus (audio format)|Opus]], and 
* to understand the content of the signal, e.g. [[music information retrieval]] to allow the identification of music tracks via [[Shazam (service)]].&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite book|last=Pohlmann|first=Ken|title=Principles of Digital Audio, Sixth Edition|year=2010|publisher=McGraw Hill Professional|isbn=9780071663472|page=336}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Audio engineers]] develop and use [[audio signal processing]] algorithms.

===Architectural acoustics===

[[Image:Disney Concert Hall by Carol Highsmith.jpg|right|thumb|[[Walt Disney Concert Hall|Disney's Concert Hall]] was meticulously designed for superior acoustical qualities.]]
[[File:Heichal Hatarbut1.jpg|thumb|Ceiling of [[Culture Palace (Tel Aviv)]] concert hall is covered with [[perforated metal]] panels]]
Architectural acoustics (also known as '''building acoustics''') is the science and engineering of achieving a good sound within a building.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Morfey|first=Christopher|title=Dictionary of Acoustics|year=2001|publisher=Academic Press|pages=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; Architectural acoustics can be about achieving good speech intelligibility in a theatre, restaurant or railway station, enhancing the quality of music in a concert hall or recording studio, or suppressing noise to make offices and homes more productive and pleasant places to work and live.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Templeton|first=Duncan|title=Acoustics in the Built Environment: Advice for the Design Team|year=1993|publisher=Architectural Press|isbn=978-0750605380}}&lt;/ref&gt; Architectural acoustic design is usually done by acoustic consultants.&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;{{cite web|last=National Careers Service|title=Job profiles Acoustics consultant|url=https://nationalcareersservice.direct.gov.uk/advice/planning/jobprofiles/Pages/acousticsconsultant.aspx}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bioacoustics===
{{main|Bioacoustics}}

Bioacoustics usually concerns the scientific study of sound production and hearing in animals. It can include: acoustic communication and associated animal behaviour and evolution of species; how sound is produced by animals; the auditory mechanisms and neurophysiology of animals; the use of sound to monitor animal populations, and the effect of man-made noise on animals.&lt;ref name= "bioacoustics"&gt;{{cite web|publisher=ASA|url=http://www.animalbioacoustics.org/bioacoustics.html |title= Acoustical Society of America Animal Bioacoustics Technical Committee.

{{See also|Audio engineering|Sound reinforcement system}}
This branch of acoustic engineering deals with the design of headphones, microphones, loudspeakers, sound systems, sound reproduction and recording.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Acoustical Society of America|title=Acoustics and You (A Career in Acoustics?)|url=http://asaweb.devcloud.acquia-sites.com/education_outreach/careers_in_acoustics|accessdate=21 May 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150904010934/http://asaweb.devcloud.acquia-sites.com/education_outreach/careers_in_acoustics|archive-date=2015-09-04|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There has been a rapid increase in the use of portable electronic devices which can reproduce sound and rely on electroacoustic engineering, e.g. [[mobile phone]]s, [[portable media player]]s, and [[tablet computer]]s.

===Environmental noise===
{{main|Environmental noise}}
{{see also|Noise pollution|Noise control}}
[[Image:Woodstock 2007.jpg|right|thumb|At outdoor concerts like [[Woodstock Festival (Poland)|Woodstock]], acoustic analysis is critical to creating the best experience for the audience and the performers.]]
Environmental acoustics is concerned with the control of noise and vibrations caused by traffic, aircraft, industrial equipment, recreational activities and anything else that might be considered a nuisance.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Acoustical engineers concerned with environmental acoustics face the challenge of measuring or predicting likely noise levels, determining an acceptable level for that noise, and determining how the noise can be controlled. Environmental acoustics work is usually done by acoustic consultants or those working in [[environmental health]].&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt; Recent research work has put a strong emphasis on [[soundscape]]s, the positive use of sound (e.g. fountains, bird song), and the preservation of [[tranquility]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kang|first=Jian|title=Urban Sound Environment|year=2006|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-0415358576}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Musical acoustics===
{{main|Musical acoustics}}

Musical acoustics is concerned with researching and describing the physics of music and its perception – how [[sound]]s employed as [[music]] work. This includes: the function and design of [[musical instrument]]s including electronic [[synthesizers]]; the human voice (the [[physics]] and [[neurophysiology]] of [[singing]]); computer analysis of music and composition; the clinical use of music in music therapy, and the perception and cognition of [[music]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Technical Committee on Musical Acoustics (TCMU) of the Acoustical Society of America (ASA)|url=http://www.public.coe.edu/~jcotting/tcmu/|title=ASA TCMU Home Page|accessdate=22 May 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010613120620/http://www.public.coe.edu/~jcotting/tcmu/|archive-date=2001-06-13|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Noise control===
{{main|Noise control}}

Noise control is a set of strategies to reduce [[noise pollution]] by reducing noise at its source, by inhibiting sound propagation using [[noise barrier]]s or similar, or by the use of ear protection ([[earmuffs]] or [[earplug]]s).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bies|first=David|title=Engineering Noise Control: Theory and Practice|year=2009|isbn=978-0415487078}}&lt;/ref&gt; Control at the source is the most cost-effective way of providing noise control. Noise control engineering applied to cars and trucks is known as [[noise, vibration, and harshness]] (NVH). Other techniques to reduce product noise include [[vibration isolation]], application of acoustic absorbent and acoustic enclosures. Acoustical engineering can go beyond noise control to look at what is the best sound for a product,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=University of Salford|title=Making products sound better|url=http://www.acoustics.salford.ac.uk/res/cox/sound_quality/}}&lt;/ref&gt; for instance, manipulating the sound of door closures on [[automobile]]s.

===Psychoacoustics===
{{main|Psychoacoustics}}

[[Psychoacoustics]] tries to explain how humans respond to what they hear, whether that is an annoying noise or beautiful music. In many branches of acoustic engineering, a human listener is a final arbitrator as to whether a design is successful, for instance, whether [[sound localisation]] works in a [[surround sound]] system. "Psychoacoustics seeks to reconcile acoustical stimuli and all the scientific, objective, and physical properties that surround them, with the physiological and psychological responses evoked by them."&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

===Speech===
{{main|Speech}}

Speech is a major area of study for acoustical engineering, including the production, processing and perception of speech. This can include [[physics]], [[physiology]], [[psychology]], [[audio signal processing]] and [[linguistics]]. [[Speech recognition]] and [[speech synthesis]] are two important aspects of the machine processing of speech. Ensuring [[speech transmission index|speech is transmitted intelligibly]], efficiently and with high quality; in rooms, through public address systems and through telephone systems are other important areas of study.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Speech Communication Technical Committee|title=Speech Communication|url=http://acosoc.org/TechComm/SCTC/|publisher=Acoustical Society of America|accessdate=22 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ultrasonics===
{{main|Ultrasound}}
[[File:CRL Crown rump lengh 12 weeks ecografia Dr. Wolfgang Moroder.jpg|thumb|right|Ultrasound image of a fetus in the womb, viewed at 12 weeks of pregnancy (bidimensional-scan)]]Ultrasonics deals with sound waves in solids, liquids and gases at frequencies too high to be heard by the average person. Specialists areas include medical ultrasonics (including [[medical ultrasonography]]), [[sonochemistry]], [[nondestructive testing]], material characterisation and [[underwater acoustics]] ([[sonar]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ensminger|first=Dale|title=Ultrasonics: Fundamentals, Technologies, and Applications|year=2012|publisher=CRC Press|pages=1–2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Underwater acoustics===
{{main|Underwater acoustics}}

Underwater acoustics is the scientific study of sound in water. It is concerned with both natural and man-made sound and its generation underwater; how it propagates, and the perception of the sound by animals. Applications include [[sonar]] to locate submerged objects such as [[submarines]], underwater communication by animals, observation of sea temperatures for climate change monitoring, and marine biology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=ASA Underwater Acoustics Technical Committee |title=Underwater Acoustics |url=http://www.apl.washington.edu/projects/ASA-UATC/index.php |accessdate=22 May 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130730104616/http://www.apl.washington.edu/projects/ASA-UATC/index.php |archivedate=30 July 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vibration and dynamics===
{{main|Vibration}}

Acoustic engineers working on [[vibration]] study the motions and interactions of mechanical systems with their environments, including measurement, analysis and control. This might include: [[ground vibrations]] from railways and construction; [[vibration isolation]] to reduce noise getting into recording studios; studying the effects of vibration on humans ([[vibration white finger]]); [[vibration control]] to protect a bridge from [[earthquakes]], or modelling the propagation of structure-borne sound through buildings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Structural Acoustics &amp; Vibration Technical Committee |title=Structural Acoustics &amp; Vibration Technical Committee |url=http://fubini.swarthmore.edu/~bbard/savtc.html |accessdate=22 May 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131103180745/http://fubini.swarthmore.edu/~bbard/savtc.html |archivedate=3 November 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fundamental science==

Although the way in which sound interacts with its surroundings is often extremely complex, there are a few ideal sound wave behaviours that are fundamental to understanding acoustical design.  Complex sound wave behaviors include [[Absorption (acoustics)|absorption]], [[reverberation]], [[diffraction]], and [[refraction]]. Absorption is the loss of energy that occurs when a sound wave reflects off of a surface. Just as light waves reflect off of surfaces, sound waves also reflect off of surfaces, and every reflection results in a loss of energy.  Absorption refers both to the sound that transmits through and the energy that is dissipated by a material.&lt;ref&gt;Barron, 2002, ch. 7.1.&lt;/ref&gt; Reverberation is the persistence of sound that is caused by repeated boundary reflections after the source of the sound stops. This principle is particularly important in enclosed spaces.  In addition to reflecting off of surfaces, sound waves also bend around surfaces in the path of the waves.  This bending is known as diffraction.  Refraction is another kind of sound wave bending.  This type of bending, however, is caused by changes in the medium through which the wave is passing and not the presence of obstacles in the path of a sound wave.  Temperature gradients, for example, cause bending in sound waves.&lt;ref&gt;Hemond, 1983, pp. 24–44.&lt;/ref&gt; Acoustical engineers apply these fundamental concepts, along with complex mathematical analysis, to control sound for a variety of applications.

'''Agribusiness''' is the [[business]] of agricultural production. The term was coined in 1957 by Goldberg and Davis. It includes [[agrichemical]]s, [[Animal husbandry|breeding]], [[crop]] production ([[farming]] and [[contract farming]]), distribution, [[agricultural machinery|farm machinery]], [[processed food|processing]], and [[seed]] supply, as well as [[marketing]] and [[retail]] sales. All agents of the food and fiber value chain and those institutions that influence it are part of the agribusiness system.

Within the agriculture [[industry]], "agribusiness" is used simply as a [[portmanteau]] of agriculture and business, referring to the range of activities and disciplines encompassed by modern food production. There are [[academic degrees]] in and departments of agribusiness, agribusiness [[trade associations]], agribusiness [[publications]], and so forth, worldwide. 

In the context of agribusiness management in academia, each individual element of agriculture production and distribution may be described as agribusinesses. However, the term "agribusiness" most often emphasizes the "interdependence" of these various sectors within the production chain.&lt;ref name = Ng&amp;Siebert&gt;{{cite journal| title = Toward Better Defining the Field of Agribusiness Management| first1 = Desmond| last1 = Ng |first2 = John W. | last2 = Siebert| journal = International Food and Agribusiness Management Review| volume = 12| issue= 4| year = 2009|url = http://ageconsearch.umn.edu/bitstream/92566/2/20091014_Formatted.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among critics of large-scale, industrialized, [[vertical integration|vertically integrated]] food production, the term ''agribusiness'' is used negatively, synonymous with ''[[corporate farming]]''. As such, it is often contrasted with smaller [[family farm|family-owned farms]].  Although recent trends have seen Agribusiness firms with an ethical drive, such as [http://caspian-farming.com/ Caspian Farming] who's goal is to push towards low impact farming and sustainable development.

== Examples ==
Examples of agribusinesses include seed and agrichemical producers like [[Dow AgroSciences]], [[DuPont]], [[Monsanto]], and [[Syngenta]]; AB Agri (part of [[Associated British Foods]]) animal feeds, biofuels, and micro-ingredients, [[Archer Daniels Midland|ADM]], grain transport and processing; [[John Deere]], farm machinery producer; [[Ocean Spray (cooperative)|Ocean Spray]], farmer's cooperative; and [[Purina Farms]], [[agritourism]] farm.

As concern over [[global warming]] intensifies, [[biofuels]] derived from crops are gaining increased public and scientific attention. This is driven by factors such as [[Oil price increases since 2003|oil price spikes]], the need for increased [[energy security]], concern over [[greenhouse gas]] emissions from [[fossil fuel]]s, and support from [[Ethanol fuel in the United States#Tax credits|government subsidies]]. In Europe and in the US, increased research and production of [[biofuels]] have been mandated by law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wild.org/blog/backpedaling-on-biofuels/ |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120919065908/http://www.wild.org/blog/backpedaling-on-biofuels/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-09-19 |title=Backpedaling on Biofuels |publisher=Wild.org |date=2008-08-01 |accessdate=2013-05-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Studies and reports ==

Studies of agribusiness often come from the academic fields of [[agricultural economics]] and [[management studies]], sometimes called agribusiness management.&lt;ref name=Ng&amp;Siebert/&gt; To promote more development of food economies, many government agencies support the research and publication of economic studies and reports exploring agribusiness and agribusiness practices. Some of these studies are on foods produced for export and are derived from agencies focused on food exports.

Ray A. Goldberg coined the term agribusiness together with coauthor [[John H. Davis (diplomat)|John H. Davis]]. They provided a rigorous economic framework for the field in their book A Concept of Agribusiness (Boston: Division of Research, Graduate School of Business Administration, Harvard University, 1957).  That seminal work traces a complex value-added chain that begins with the farmer's purchase of seed and livestock and ends with a product fit for the consumer's table. Agribusiness boundary expansion is driven by a variety of [[transaction cost]]s.{{fact|date=April 2015}}

Manuel Alvarado Ledesma (CEMA University, Argentina) and Peter D. Goldsmith (University of Illinois) explain the implications of weak institutions on agribusiness investment. According to them weak institutions lead to policy development and enforcement grounded in the moment, rather than based on precedent and deliberative processes over time.{{cn|date=December 2017}}

'''Automatic milking''' is the [[milking]] of [[dairy]] animals, especially of [[dairy cattle]], without human labour. '''Automatic milking systems''' (AMS), also called '''voluntary milking systems''' (VMS), were developed in the late 20th century. They have been commercially available since the early 1990s. The core of such systems that allows complete automation of the milking process is a type of [[agricultural robot]]. Automated milking is therefore also called '''robotic milking'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.omafra.gov.on.ca/english/livestock/dairy/robotic/index.html |title=Robotic Milking of Dairy Cows |publisher=[[Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, Food, and Rural Affairs]] |date=2012-05-16 |accessdate=2012-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Common systems rely on the use of [[computer]]s and special herd management [[Computer software|software]].

==Automated Milking==
[[File:Leitevaca.JPG|thumb|A cow and a [[milking machine]] – partial automation compared to [[Milking|hand milking]]]]
[[File:Dairy NSW.JPG|thumb|A [[rotary milking parlor]] – higher efficiency compared to stationary milking parlors, but still requiring manual labour with milking machines etc.]]

===Basics – milking process and milking schedules ===
The milking process is the collection of tasks specifically devoted to extracting [[milk]] from an animal (rather than the broader field of dairy [[animal husbandry]]). This process may be broken down into several sub-tasks: collecting animals before milking, routing animals into the parlour, inspection and cleaning of [[Nipple|teats]], attachment of milking equipment to teats, and often massaging the back of the udder to relieve any held back milk, extraction of milk, removal of milking equipment, routing of animals out of the parlour.

Maintaining milk yield during the [[lactation]] period (approximately 300 days) requires consistent milking intervals, usually twice daily and with maximum time spacing between milkings. In fact all activities must be scheduled around the milking process on the [[dairy farming|dairy farm]]. Such a milking routine imposes restrictions on time management and personal life of an individual [[farmer]], as the farmer is committed to milking in the early morning and in the evening for seven days a week regardless of personal health, family responsibilities or social schedule. This time restriction is exacerbated for lone farmers and farm families if extra labour cannot easily or economically be obtained, and is a factor in the decline in small-scale dairy farming. Techniques such as once-a-day milking and voluntary milking (see below) have been investigated to reduce these time constraints.

===Automation progress in the 20th century===
To alleviate the labour involved in milking, much of the milking process has been automated during the 20th century: many farmers use semi-automatic or automatic [[cow]] traffic control (powered gates, etc.), the [[milking machine]] (a basic form was developed in the late 19th century) has entirely automated milk extraction, and automatic cluster removal is available to remove milking equipment after milking. Automatic teat spraying systems are available, however, there is some debate over the cleaning effectiveness of these.

The final manual labour tasks remaining in the milking process were cleaning and inspection of teats and attachment of milking equipment (milking cups) to teats. Automatic cleaning and attachment of milking cups is a complex task, requiring accurate detection of teat position and a dextrous mechanical manipulator. These tasks have been automated successfully in the voluntary milking system (VMS), or automatic milking system (AMS).

==Automatic milking systems (AMS)==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Dairy]] --&gt;
[[File:Laser guided milking station.jpg|thumb|An older Lely ''Astronaut'' AMS unit at work (milking)]]
Since the 1970s, much research effort has been expended in investigating methods to alleviate time management constraints in conventional dairy farming, culminating in the development of the automated voluntary milking system. There is a [http://www.ecow.co.uk/publications/robotic-milking/ video] of the historical development of the milking robot at Silsoe Research Institute.

Voluntary milking allows the cow to decide her own milking time and interval, rather than being milked as part of a group at set milking times. AMS requires complete automation of the milking process as the cow may elect to be milked at any time during a 24-hour period.

The milking unit comprises a [[milking machine]], a teat position sensor (usually a [[laser]]), a [[robotic arm]] for automatic teat-cup application and removal, and a gate system for controlling cow traffic. The cows may be permanently housed in a barn, and spend most of their time resting or feeding in the free-stall area. If cows are to be grazed as well, using a selection gate to allow only those cows that have been milked to the outside [[pasture]]s has been advised by some AMS manufacturers.

When the cow elects to enter the milking unit (due to highly palatable feed that she finds in the milking box), a cow ID sensor reads an identification tag ([[transponder]]) on the cow and passes the cow ID to the control system. If the cow has been milked too recently, the automatic gate system sends the cow out of the unit. If the cow may be milked, automatic teat cleaning, milking cup application, milking, and teatspraying takes place. As an incentive to attend the milking unit, concentrated feedstuffs needs to be fed to the cow in the milking unit.

[[File:VMS Layout.GIF|thumb|Typical VMS stall layout (''forced cow traffic'' layout)]]
The barn may be arranged such that access to the main feeding area can only be obtained by passing the milking unit. This layout is referred to as ''forced cow traffic''.  Alternatively, the barn may be set up such that the cow always has access to feed, water, and a comfortable place to lie down, and is only motivated to visit the milking system by the palatable feed available there.  This is referred to as ''free cow traffic''.

The innovative core of the AMS system is the robotic manipulator in the milking unit. This robotic arm automates the tasks of teat cleaning and milking attachment and removes the final elements of manual labour from the milking process. Careful design of the robot arm and associated sensors and controls allows robust unsupervised performance, such that the farmer is only required to attend the cows for condition inspection and when a cow has not attended for milking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.linuxdevices.com/articles/AT8308307720.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090214194607/http://linuxdevices.com/articles/AT8308307720.html|archivedate=2009-02-14|deadurl=yes|title=Device Profile: DeLaval Voluntary Milking System|date=2005-10-21|publisher=LinuxDevices.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Typical capacity for an AMS is 50–70 cows per milking unit. AMS usually achieve milking frequencies between 2 and 3 times per day, so a single milking unit handling 60 cows and milking each cow 3 times per day has a capacity of 7.5 cows per hour. This low capacity is convenient for lower-cost design of the robot arm and associated control system, as a window of several minutes is available for each cow and high-speed operation is not required.

AMS units have been available commercially since the early 1990s, and have proved relatively successful in implementing the voluntary milking method. Many of the research and developments have taken place in the [[Netherlands]]. The most farms with AMS are located in the Netherlands, and [[Denmark]].

A new variation on the theme of robotic milking includes a similar robotic arm system, but coupled with a rotary platform, improving the number of cows that can be handled per robot arm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.futuredairy.com.au/media/robotic_rotary11Nov2010/FD-Robotic%20Rotary%20Fact%20Sheet%20Web.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120322164042/http://www.futuredairy.com.au/media/robotic_rotary11Nov2010/FD-Robotic%20Rotary%20Fact%20Sheet%20Web.pdf|archivedate=2012-03-22|deadurl=yes|title=Robotic Rotary Fact Sheet|publisher=FutureDairy|date=November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; A mobile variation of robotic milking, adapted to tie-stall configuration (stanchion barns), is used in Canada. In this configuration, the AMS travels in the centre isle of the barn approaching cows from behind to milk them in their stalls.   

===Advantages===
[[File:Melkroboter bei der Säuberung mit Bürsten.JPG|thumb|An AMS unit at work (teat cleaning)]]
* '''Elimination of labour''' - The farmer is freed from the milking process and associated rigid schedule, and labour is devoted to supervision of animals, feeding, etc.
* '''Milking consistency''' – The milking process is consistent for every cow and every visit, and is not influenced by different persons milking the cows.  The four separate milking cups are removed individually, meaning that an empty quarter does not stay attached while the other three are finishing, resulting in less threat of injury.  The newest models of automatic milkers can vary the pulsation rate and vacuum level based on milk flow from each quarter.
* '''Increased milking frequency''' – Milking frequency may increase to three times per day, however typically 2.5 times per day is achieved. This may result in less stress on the [[udder]] and increased comfort for the cow, as on average less milk is stored. Higher frequency milking increases milk yield per cow, however much of this increase is water rather than solids.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}
* '''Perceived lower stress environment''' – There is a perception that elective milking schedules reduce cow stress.
* '''Herd management''' – The use of [[computer]] control allows greater scope for data collection. Such data allows the farmer to improve management through analysis of trends in the herd, for example response of milk production to changes in feedstuffs. Individual cow histories may also be examined, and alerts set to warn the farmer of unusual changes indicating illness or injury. Information gathering provides added value for AMS, however correct interpretation and use of such information is highly dependent on the skills of the user or the accuracy of computer algorithms to create attention reports.

===Considerations and disadvantages===
* '''Higher initial cost''' – AMS systems cost approximately €120,000 ($190,524) per milking unit as of 2003 (presuming barn space is already available for loose-stall housing). Equipment costs decreased from $175,000 for the first stall to $158,000. Equipment costs decreased from $10,000/stall for a double-six parlor to $9000/stall for a double-ten parlor with a cost of $1200/stall for pipeline milking. Initial parlor cost was increased $5000/stall to represent a high cost parlor.&lt;ref name="RotzCoiner2003"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rotz|first1=C.A.|last2=Coiner|first2=C.U.|last3=Soder|first3=K.J.|title=Automatic Milking Systems, Farm Size, and Milk Production|journal=Journal of Dairy Science|volume=86|issue=12|year=2003|pages=4167–4177|doi=10.3168/jds.S0022-0302(03)74032-6|url=https://naldc.nal.usda.gov/naldc/download.xhtml?id=13062&amp;content=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whether it is economically beneficial to invest in an AMS instead of a conventional milking parlor depends on constructions costs, investments in the milking system and costs of labour. Besides costs of labour, the availability of labour should also be taken into account. In general, an AMS is economically beneficial for smaller scale farms, and large dairies can usually operate more cheaply with a milking parlor.
* '''Increased electricity costs''' - to operate the robots, but this can be more than outweighed by reduced labour input.

[[File:Lely Astronaut Display.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Touchscreen]] display of a milking robot]]
* '''Increased complexity''' – While complexity of equipment is a necessary part of technological advancement, the increased complexity of the AMS milking unit over conventional systems, increases the reliance on manufacturer maintenance services and possibly increasing operating costs. The farmer is exposed in the event of total system failure, relying on prompt response from the service provider. In practice AMS systems have proved robust and manufacturers provide good service networks. Because all milking cows have to visit the AMS voluntarily, the system requires a high quality of management. The system also involves a central place for the computer in the daily working routines.
* '''Difficult to apply in pasture systems''' – as a continuous animal is pediment for an optimal utilization of the AMS unit, AMS works at their best in zero-grazing systems, in which the cow is housed indoors for most of the lactation period. Zero-grazing suits areas (e.g. the Netherlands) where land is at a premium, as maximum land can be devoted to feed production which is then collected by the farmer and brought to the animals in the barn. In pasture systems, cows graze in fields and are required to walk to the milking parlour. It has been found that it can be challenging to make cows maintain a high milking frequency if the distance to walk between pasture and milking unit is too great. Maintaining production on pasture has, however, been shown to be possible in amongst others the [http://autograssmilk.dk/ AUTOGRASSMILK] project.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://autograssmilk.dk/results/|title=Results and deliverables|last=|first=|date=|website=autograssmilk.dk|language=en-UK|access-date=2017-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are currently research projects at the [[Dexcel facility]] in [[New Zealand]], [[University of Sydney]]'s FutureDairy site, [[Michigan State University]]'s [[Kellogg Biological Station]] and the [[Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences]]'s research facility [https://www.slu.se/en/faculties/vh/departments/the-swedish-livestock-research-center/ Lövsta Livestock Research Center], where cattle are on pasture and milked by AMS.
* '''Lower milk quality''' –With automatic milking, the total number of bacteria in whole milk, the number of anaerobic spores, somatic cell technology and freezing point increase, the frequency of milk quality failure almost doubles, which fully reflects the quality of milk caused by automatic milking. Although the automatic milking machine cleans the cow's teat and tests the pre-squeezed milk, there is still a phenomenon that the infected milk is not transferred, and the device itself is also lack of cleaning, and the milk is not handled properly. This situation was also confirmed in 2002 when investigating nearly 98 farms in Denmark with automatic milking systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2002-11-01|title=Milk Quality on Danish Farms with Automatic Milking Systems|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022030202743749|journal=Journal of Dairy Science|language=en|volume=85|issue=11|pages=2869–2878|doi=10.3168/jds.S0022-0302(02)74374-9|issn=0022-0302}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Possible increase in stress for some cows''' – Cows are social animals, and it has been found that due to dominance of some cows, others will be forced to milk only at night.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}  Such behaviour is inconsistent with the perception that AM reduces stress by allowing "free choice" of milking time.
* '''Decreased contact between farmer and herd''' – Effective animal husbandry requires that the farmer be fully aware of herd condition. In conventional milking, the cows are observed before milking equipment is attached, and ill or injured cows can be earmarked for attention. Automatic milking removes the farmer from such close contact with the animal, with the possibility that illness may go unnoticed for longer periods and both milk quality and cow welfare suffer. In practice, milk quality sensors at the milking unit attempt to detect changes in milk due to infection, and farmers inspect the herd frequently. However this concern has meant that farmers are still tied to a seven-day schedule.  Modern automatic milking systems attempt to rectify this problem by gathering data that would not be available in many conventional systems including milk temperature, milk conductivity, milk color including infrared scan, change in milking speed, change in milking time or milk letdown by quarter, cow's weight, cow's activity (movements), time spent ruminating, etc.
* '''Dependence on the robotics company''' – maintenance becomes significantly more time critical and may put the farmer at greater risk. For example, one farm in Estonia reported losses of over 1 million euros, when the robots from BouMatic Robotics performed below promised standards and the company failed to provide maintenance.&lt;ref&gt;Urmo Andressoo: [https://www.aripaev.ee/uudised/2017/11/28/miljon-vastu-taevast-streikivate-lupsirobotite-lugu "Miljon vastu taevast: streikivate lüpsirobotite lugu"].

The '''Centre for Ultrahigh bandwidth Devices for Optical Systems''' (or '''CUDOS''') is a collaboration of Australian and international researchers in optical science and photonics technology. CUDOS is an [[Australian Research Council]] Centre of Excellence and was formally launched in 2003.

==Funding History==
CUDOS commenced operation in 2003 as one of the first Australian Research Council Centres of Excellence,&lt;ref&gt;ARC Centres of Excellence Selection Report for funding commencing in 2003, Retrieved 2013-07-04&lt;/ref&gt; and began with 4 research programs across 7 groups. 

It continued through 2007 when ARC renewed funding for another 3 years. 

The latest incarnation is based on new ARC funding from 2011-2017, with Australian and international researchers collaborating on 6 new Flagship projects.  &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.arc.gov.au/news-media/media-releases/kudos-cudos|title=Kudos for CUDOS|last=|first=|date=2011-04-06|website=www.arc.gov.au|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Participants ==
CUDOS is a research consortium between 8 groups at 6 Australian Universities: The [[University of Sydney]] (CUDOS headquarters), [[Australian National University]], [[Macquarie University]], [[University of Technology Sydney]], [[RMIT University]] and [[Monash University]].

The Research Director is Professor [[Ben Eggleton]], with Professor [[Yuri Kivshar]] as Deputy Director and Professor Martijn de Sterke as Associate Director.

== Aims ==
CUDOS aims to be the world-leader in research in on-chip photonics, for all-optical signal processing. The centre conducts research to create a world-best on-chip photonic platform for information transfer and processing technologies. CUDOS aims to translate the intellectual capital, which the researchers create to build a community of professionals which can drive wealth creation in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sydney.edu.au/news/science/397.html?newsstoryid=6795|title=CUDOS launch|last=|first=|date=|website=sydney.edu.au|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
CUDOS brings together a powerful team of Australian and international researchers in optical science and photonics technology, and has played a pivotal role in demonstrating ground-breaking integrated photonic signal processors that can massively increase the information capacity of the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/catalyst/stories/2675781.htm|title=Catalyst: Photonic Chip - ABC TV Science|website=www.abc.net.au|language=en-au|access-date=2017-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The centre currently has six Flagship Projects.

[[Photonic metamaterials|Functional Metamaterials and Metadevices]]: Metamaterials are synthesised on the sub-wavelength scale to have optical properties (refractive index, dispersion) that can differ dramatically from those of bulk materials: perfect lenses, cloaking, and negative refractive index materials are examples. CUDOS aims to develop metamaterials that will enable entirely new ways to control photons.

[[Surface plasmon polaritons|On-chip Nanoplasmonics]]: The refractive index of metals is very high, so the wavelength of the optical modes is very short. CUDOS is developing novel techniques to fabricate nano-structured composites of metals and optically transmitting materials. They are investigating novel modes of light propagation in these materials and use them to create ultracompact devices like transmission lines and antennae. The vision of this project is to develop three- and two-dimensional nanoplasmonic structures that can allow unprecedented control of light at the sub wavelength scale.

Hybrid integration: As metamaterials, nanoplasmonic materials and new kinds of nonlinear optical materials are developed, they need to be integrated with existing optical platforms of silicon or chalcogenide, so that light can pass from one material to another on the same ‘chip’. This project aims to develop novel designs for integrating such hybrid materials, and novel fabrication techniques.

Mid-Infrared Photonics: The [[mid-infrared]] region of the spectrum (3 – 10&amp;nbsp;µm) has enormous potential for highly efficient sensing of molecules significant in agriculture, natural resource management, homeland security, and others. CUDOS developed photonic platforms and novel sources for this region.

Nonlinear Quantum Photonics: This research focuses on highly compact approaches based on nonlinear optics to generate single photons. The aim is to achieve this on a chip and create a fully integrated flexible platform to generate these single photons and use them to perform quantum-based processing operations.

Terabit per second Photonics: All-optical processing has the potential to replace electronics in many areas of ultrahigh bandwidth communications systems. CUDOS is developing all-optical processors, using nonlinear optics, and investigating new approaches to enable much higher volumes of data to be carried per unit of optical bandwidth.

CUDOS research has been working towards optical circuitry which could result in much faster speeds for data transmission.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/ra/innovations/stories/s1772254.htm Radio Australia – Innovations – Slow Light Data.

A '''chute''' is a vertical or [[inclined plane]], channel, or passage through which objects are moved by means of [[gravity]].

==Landform==
A chute, also known as a race, [[flume]], cat, or river canyon, is a steep-sided passage through which water flows rapidly.

Akin to these, man-made chutes, such as the [[timber slide]] and [[log flume]], were used in the [[logging]] industry to facilitate the downstream transportation of timber along rivers. These are no longer in common use. Man-made chutes may also be a feature of [[spillway]]s on some [[dam]]s.  Some types of water supply and irrigation systems are gravity fed, hence chutes.  These include [[aqueduct (water supply)|aqueducts]], [[puquios]], and [[acequia]]s.

==Building chute==
Chutes are in common use in tall buildings to allow the rapid transport of items from the upper floors to a central location on one of the lower floors or basement. Chutes may be round, square or rectangular at the top and/or the bottom.

* '''[[Laundry]] chutes''' in [[hotel]]s are placed on each floor to allow the expedient transfer and collection of dirty laundry to the hotel's laundry facility without having to use [[elevator]]s or stairs. In stories, laundry chutes are commonly used as means for the [[protagonist]] to quickly escape, the laundry at the chute's base often serving to cushion the hero's fall.  These chutes are generally aluminized steel and welded together to avoid any extruding parts that may rip or damage the materials.

: Home laundry chutes are placed on each floor of multistory [[home]]s allow the collection of all household members' dirty laundry to one location, conveniently next to the laundry facilities, without the constant transport of laundry bins from story-to-story or room-to-room or up and down stairs. Home laundry chutes may be less common than previously due to building codes or concern regarding [[fireblocking]], the prevention of fire from spreading from floor-to-floor,&lt;ref&gt;Dru Sefton, Sunday, January 23, 2005. .&lt;/ref&gt; as well as child safety.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.checkthishouse.com/laundry-chutes-a-convenient-way-to-a-disaster.html "Laundry Chutes - a Convenient Way to a … Disaster"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090802021555/http://www.checkthishouse.com/laundry-chutes-a-convenient-way-to-a-disaster.html |date=2009-08-02 }}, ''Check This House, Inc.''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;January 21, 2009. [http://www.oneprojectcloser.com/fixtures_furnishings/laundry-chute-pros-cons/comment-page-1/#comment-32685 "Laundry Chutes: Pros &amp; Cons"], ''One Project Closer''.&lt;/ref&gt; However, construction including cabinets, doors, lids, and [[Child safety lock|locks]] may make both risks significantly less than with simple [[stairwell]]s.

* '''Garbage chutes''' are common in high-rise [[apartment building]]s and are used to collect all the building's garbage in the one place. Often the bottom end of the chute is placed directly above a large [[waste receptacle]]. This makes garbage collection more efficient.
* '''[[Mail chute]]s''' are used in some buildings to collect the occupants' mail.  A notable example is the [[Asia Insurance Building]].
* '''[[Escape chute]]s''' are used and proposed for use in evacuation of mining equipment and high-rise buildings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ingstromescapechute.com.au |title=Ingstrom Escape Chute - Building Evacuation Chute |publisher=Ingstromescapechute.com.au |date= |accessdate=2008-11-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080718212321/http://www.ingstromescapechute.com.au/ |archivedate=2008-07-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lifechute.com/index2.html |title=Baker Life Chute - Rapid, Mass Evacuation from High Rise Structures during Life Threatening Emergencies |publisher=Lifechute.com |date= |accessdate=2008-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Construction chutes''' are used to remove [[rubble]] and similar demolition materials safely from taller buildings.  These temporary structures typically consist of a chain of cylindrical or conical plastic tubes, each fitted into the top of the one below and tied together, usually with [[chain]]s.  Together they form a long flexible tube, which is hung down the side of the building.  The lower end of this tube is placed over a [[Skip (container)|skip]] or other receptacle, and waste materials are dropped into the top.  Heavy duty steel chutes may also be used when the debris being deposited is heavy duty and in cases of particularly high buildings.

An [[elevator]] is not a chute since it does not operate by means of gravity.

== Chutes in transportation ==
[[Goust]], a hamlet in southwestern [[France]], is notable for its mountainside chute that is used to transport [[coffin]]s.

Chutes are also found in:
* [[Hopper car]]s
* [[Hopper barge]]s

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6063">'''Construction collaboration technology''' refers to software applications used to enable effective sharing of project-related information between geographically dispersed members of a [[construction]] project team, often through use of a web-based [[software as a service]] platform.

==History==
The terms "[[Construction Communication|construction collaboration]]" and "construction collaboration software" were coined in Australia by Aconex in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;"Aconex Products and services brochure, 9 May 2001"&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}} It was later adopted in 2003 in the UK when seven [[United Kingdom|UK]]-based vendors joined together to form the Network for Construction Collaboration Technology Providers (NCCTP), to promote the benefits and use of collaborative technologies in the [[architecture]], [[engineering]], construction (AEC) and related industries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnplus.co.uk/news/software-body/845778.article "Eight construction software providers are joining forces to form a representative body", ''Construction News'' 16 January 2003]&lt;/ref&gt;

The phrase was taken on in the UK as it was preferred to the then commonly used term 'project [[extranet]]' which was felt might exclude use of the platforms for multi-project programmes of work, or for post-construction collaboration - e.g.: for [[facilities management]].&lt;ref&gt;Wilkinson, P. (2005) ''Construction Collaboration Technologies: The Extranet Evolution'' Taylor &amp; Francis, London, pp.6-7.&lt;/ref&gt; It also supported progressive moves within the UK construction industry to promote more collaborative or integrated approaches following the 1994 [[Latham Report|Latham]] and 1998 [[Egan Report]]s. For example, Sir John Egan's follow-up report, ''Accelerating Change'' in 2002, recommended:

:'Integrated teams, created at the optimal time in the process and ''using an integrated IT approach'', that fully release the contribution each can make and equitably share risk and reward in a non-adversarial way.' (p.10, emphasis added)&lt;ref&gt;Egan, J. (2002) ''Accelerating Change'': Consultation Paper by Strategic Forum for Construction, London: HMSO.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other descriptions such as 'construction [[project management]]' or 'construction [[document management]]' were seen as confusing or misleading, being associated more with scheduling tools (e.g.: [[Microsoft Project]]) or with generic electronic document management systems (e.g.: [[Documentum]]) that could not easily handle AEC-oriented requirements for dispersed teams.

==Characteristics==
Essentially, construction collaboration technologies are deployed to support the requirements of a multi-disciplinary construction project team. This is typically drawn from multiple companies, all based in different locations with their own IT systems, and is brought together – usually temporarily – to plan, design, construct and, in some cases, to operate and maintain the resulting built asset.&lt;ref&gt;http://ncctp.constructingexcellence.org.uk/about_ct.jsp Collaboration Technologies Explained (NCCTP)&lt;/ref&gt; It is common for construction collaboration technology to be cloud based, or hosted as a centralised database. These platforms enable information to be shared and accessed in real-time by all team members.

Construction collaboration technologies replace localised sets of data held by individual team members or companies. A centralised repository or data store is created that can be accessed by all authorised team members, usually using a lowest common denominator technology: a computer equipped with an internet browser and a telecommunications link to the internet. The platforms' functionality also reflects the industry's extensive use of graphical information - most notably design drawings - and the need to be able to access, view, mark-up and comment on designs.

The core characteristics of construction collaboration technologies can be summarised&lt;ref&gt;Wilkinson, P. (2005), pp.65-94.&lt;/ref&gt; as:
* Organisation features (i.e.: security settings, user administration, information administration)
* Communication features (i.e.: file publication, management, feedback)
* Management features (i.e.: management of specific workflows, teams, work packages, multiple projects, standards)
* Sharing, viewing and working with [[Computer-aided design|CAD]]-based drawings (including use of viewing tools)

Reflecting the need to encourage take-up and active use of their platforms, the leading UK construction collaboration technology vendors all adopted a similar charging structure. Rather than charging companies per-user or [[per-seat license]]s, the applications were typically licensed per-project, with customers paying a single subscription (typically monthly or quarterly) for the duration of the planning, design and construction process, and allowing use by all companies in the project's supply chain.

==Vendors==
The founder members of the NCCTP were:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ciria.org.uk/pdf/ciria_news%204.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; 4Projects (Since Acquired by Viewpoint Construction Software){{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}, [[BIW Technologies]], BuildOnline,&lt;ref&gt;BuildOnline merged with Citadon in 2006 to form CTSpace (later [[Sword CTSpace]]), which was acquired by IDOX Software in November 2011 - London Stock Exchange announcement (15 November 2011) ''Acquisition of engineering and construction document management and control business for £11.6m'', http://www.londonstockexchange.com/exchange/news/market-news/market-news-detail.html?announcementId=11034150.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cadweb]], [[Causeway Technologies]] and [[Sarcophagus Ltd|Sarcophagus]]. Business Collaborator and [[Aconex]] joined shortly afterwards.{{cn|date=February 2012}} The NCCTP was initially managed by [[CIRIA]] before becoming a membership forum within [[Constructing Excellence]] in August 2007.{{cn|date=February 2012}}

[[File:CirrusLogicCS4282-AB.jpg|thumb|right|200px|8-channel [[Cirrus Logic]] CS4382 digital-to-analog converter as used in a [[sound card]].]]

In [[electronics]], a '''digital-to-analog converter''' ('''DAC''', '''D/A''', '''D2A''', or '''D-to-A''') is a system that converts a [[Digital signal (signal processing)|digital signal]] into an [[analog signal]]. An [[analog-to-digital converter]] (ADC) performs the reverse function.

There are several DAC [[hardware architecture|architectures]]; the suitability of a DAC for a particular application is determined by [[figures of merit]] including: [[resolution (audio)|resolution]], maximum [[sampling frequency]] and others.  Digital-to-analog conversion can degrade a signal, so a DAC should be specified that has insignificant errors in terms of the application. 

DACs are commonly used in [[digital audio player|music players]] to convert digital data streams into analog audio signals. They are also used in [[television]]s and [[mobile phone]]s to convert digital video data into analog video signals which connect to the screen drivers to display monochrome or color images. These two applications use DACs at opposite ends of the frequency/resolution trade-off. The audio DAC is a low-frequency, high-resolution type while the video DAC is a high-frequency low- to medium-resolution type. 

Due to the complexity and the need for precisely matched [[electronic components|components]], all but the most specialized DACs are implemented as [[integrated circuits]] (ICs). Discrete DACs would typically be extremely high speed low resolution power hungry types, as used in military [[radar]] systems. Very high speed test equipment, especially sampling [[oscilloscope]]s, may also use discrete DACs.

==Overview==
[[File:Sampled.signal.svg|thumb|Ideally sampled signal.]]
[[File:Zeroorderhold.signal.svg|thumb|Piecewise constant output of a conventional DAC lacking a [[reconstruction filter]].  In a practical DAC, a filter or the finite bandwidth of the device smooths out the step response into a continuous curve.]]
A DAC converts an [[abstract object|abstract]] finite-precision number (usually a [[fixed-point arithmetic|fixed-point]] [[binary number]]) into a  physical quantity (e.g., a [[voltage]] or a [[pressure]]). In particular, DACs are often used to convert finite-precision [[time series]] data to a continually varying physical [[signal]].

An ''ideal'' DAC converts the abstract numbers into a conceptual sequence of [[Dirac delta function|impulse]]s that are then processed by a [[reconstruction filter]] using some form of [[interpolation]] to fill in data between the impulses. A conventional ''practical'' DAC converts the numbers into a [[piecewise constant function]] made up of a sequence of [[rectangular function]]s that is modeled with the [[zero-order hold]]. Other DAC methods (such as  those based on [[delta-sigma modulation]]) produce a [[pulse-density modulation|pulse-density modulated]] output that can be similarly filtered to produce a smoothly varying signal.

As per the [[Nyquist&amp;ndash;Shannon sampling theorem]], a DAC can reconstruct the original signal from the sampled data provided that its bandwidth meets certain requirements (e.g., a [[baseband]] signal with [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] less than the [[Nyquist frequency]]). Digital sampling introduces [[quantization error]] that manifests as low-level noise in the reconstructed signal.

==Applications==
[[File:8 bit DAC.svg|thumb|A simplified functional diagram of an 8-bit DAC]]
DACs and ADCs are part of an [[enabling technology]] that has contributed greatly to the [[digital revolution]]. To illustrate, consider a typical long-distance telephone call. The caller's voice is converted into an analog electrical signal by a [[microphone]], then the analog signal is converted to a digital stream by an ADC. The digital stream is then divided into [[network packet]]s where it may be sent along with other [[digital data]], not necessarily audio. The packets are then received at the destination, but each packet may take a completely different route and may not even arrive at the destination in the correct time order. The digital voice data is then extracted from the packets and assembled into a digital data stream. A DAC converts this back into an analog electrical signal, which drives an [[audio amplifier]], which in turn drives a [[loudspeaker]], which finally produces sound.

===Audio===
Most modern audio signals are stored in digital form (for example [[MP3]]s and [[Compact disc|CDs]]) and, in order to be heard through speakers, they must be converted into an analog signal. DACs are therefore found in [[CD player]]s, [[digital music player]]s, and PC [[sound card]]s.

Specialist standalone DACs can also be found in high-end [[hi-fi]] systems. These normally take the digital output of a compatible [[CD player]] or dedicated [[Transport (recording)|transport]] (which is basically a CD player with no internal DAC) and convert the signal into an analog  [[line-level]] output that can then be fed into an [[amplifier]] to drive speakers.

Similar digital-to-analog converters can be found in [[digital speakers]] such as [[Universal Serial Bus|USB]] speakers, and in [[sound card]]s.

In [[voice over IP]] applications, the source must first be digitized for transmission, so it undergoes conversion via an ADC, and is then reconstructed into analog using a DAC on the receiving party's end.

[[File:Cd-player-top-loading-and-DAC.jpg|thumb|right|Top-loading CD player and external digital-to-analog converter.]]

===Video===

Video sampling tends to work on a completely different scale altogether thanks to the highly nonlinear response both of cathode ray tubes (for which the vast majority of digital video foundation work was targeted) and the human eye, using a "gamma curve" to provide an appearance of evenly distributed brightness steps across the display's full dynamic range - hence the need to use [[RAMDAC]]s in computer video applications with deep enough colour resolution to make engineering a hardcoded value into the DAC for each output level of each channel impractical (e.g. an Atari ST or Sega Genesis would require 24 such values; a 24-bit video card would need 768...). Given this inherent distortion, it is not unusual for a television or video projector to truthfully claim a linear contrast ratio (difference between darkest and brightest output levels) of 1000:1 or greater, equivalent to 10 bits of audio precision even though it may only accept signals with 8-bit precision and use an LCD panel that only represents 6 or 7 bits per channel.

Video signals from a digital source, such as a computer, must be converted to analog form if they are to be displayed on an analog monitor.  As of 2007, analog inputs were more commonly used than digital, but this  changed as [[flat panel display]]s with [[Digital Visual Interface|DVI]] and/or [[High-Definition Multimedia Interface|HDMI]] connections became more widespread.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}} A video DAC is, however, incorporated in any digital video player with analog outputs.  The DAC is usually integrated with some [[computer storage|memory]] ([[random-access memory|RAM]]), which contains conversion tables for [[gamma correction]], contrast and brightness, to make a device called a [[RAMDAC]].

A device that is distantly related to the DAC is the [[digitally controlled potentiometer]], used to control an analog signal digitally.

===Mechanical===
[[File:Selectric.ogv|thumb|IBM Selectric typewriter uses a mechanical digital-to-analog converter to control its typeball.]]

A one-bit mechanical actuator assumes two positions: one when on, another when off. The motion of several one-bit actuators can be combined and weighted with a [[Whippletree (mechanism)|whiffletree]] mechanism to produce finer steps. The [[IBM Selectric]] typewriter uses such a system.&lt;ref&gt;Joachim Duebbers, [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTjxwVfx8GA IBM Selectric Typewriter Learning Program 10-3A: Input] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160316201123/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTjxwVfx8GA |date=2016-03-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
The most common types of electronic DACs are:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.analog.com/media/en/training-seminars/design-handbooks/Data-Conversion-Handbook/Chapter3.pdf |work=Data converter Architectures |title=Analog-Digital Conversion |publisher=Analog Devices |accessdate=2017-08-30 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170830032212/http://www.analog.com/media/en/training-seminars/design-handbooks/Data-Conversion-Handbook/Chapter3.pdf |archivedate=2017-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[pulse-width modulation|pulse-width modulator]] where a stable [[current (electricity)|current]] or [[voltage]] is switched into a low-pass [[analog filter]] with a duration determined by the digital input code. This technique is often used for electric motor speed control and other applications.&lt;!--[[User:Kvng/RTH]]--&gt;
* Oversampling DACs or interpolating DACs such as the delta-sigma DAC, use a pulse density conversion technique. The [[oversampling]] technique allows for the use of a lower resolution DAC internally. A simple [[1-bit DAC]] is often chosen because the oversampled result is inherently linear. The DAC is driven with a [[Pulse-density modulation|pulse-density modulated]] signal, created with the use of a [[low-pass filter]], [[Sign function|step nonlinearity]] (the actual 1-bit DAC), and [[negative feedback]] loop, in a technique called [[delta-sigma modulation]]. This results in an effective [[high-pass filter]] acting on the [[quantization noise]], thus steering this noise out of the low frequencies of interest into the megahertz frequencies of little interest, in a process called [[noise shaping]]. The quantization noise at these high frequencies is removed or greatly attenuated by use of an analog low-pass filter at the output (sometimes a simple [[RC circuit|RC low-pass circuit]] is sufficient). Most very high resolution DACs (greater than 16 bits) are of this type due to its high [[linearity]] and low cost. Higher oversampling rates can relax the specifications of the output low-pass filter and enable further suppression of quantization noise. Speeds of greater than 100 thousand samples per second (for example, 192&amp;nbsp;kHz) and resolutions of 24 bits are attainable with delta-sigma DACs. A short comparison with pulse-width modulation shows that a 1-bit DAC with a simple first-order [[integrator]] would have to run at 3&amp;nbsp;THz (which is physically unrealizable) to achieve 24 meaningful bits of resolution, requiring a higher-order low-pass filter in the noise-shaping loop. A single integrator is a low-pass filter with a [[frequency response]] inversely proportional to frequency and using one such integrator in the noise-shaping loop is a first order delta-sigma modulator. Multiple higher order topologies (such as [[MASH (modulator)|MASH]]) are used to achieve higher degrees of noise-shaping with a [[BIBO stability|stable topology]].
* The binary-weighted DAC, which contains individual electrical components for each bit of the DAC connected to a summing point. This summing point can a summing [[Operational amplifier|op-amp]]. Each input resistor in the summing [[Operational amplifier|op-amp]] would have values powers of two with most current at [[Most-significant bit|MSB]] since they have the same resistor voltage source.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.electronics-tutorial.net/analog-integrated-circuits/data-converters/binary-weighted-resistor-dac/index.html|title=Binary Weighted Resistor DAC|website=Electronics Tutorial|language=en-US|access-date=2018-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; These precise voltages or currents sum to the correct output value. This is one of the fastest conversion methods but suffers from poor accuracy because of the high precision required for each individual voltage or current. Such high-precision components are expensive, so this type of converter is usually limited to 8-bit resolution or less.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}
** Switched [[resistor]] DAC contains a parallel resistor network.  Individual resistors are enabled or bypassed in the network based on the digital input.
** Switched [[current source]] DAC, from which different current sources are selected based on the digital input.
** Switched [[capacitor]] DAC contains a parallel capacitor network.  Individual capacitors are connected or disconnected with switches based on the input.
* The [[resistor ladder|R-2R ladder]] DAC which is a binary-weighted DAC that uses a repeating cascaded structure of resistor values R and 2R. This improves the precision due to the relative ease of producing equal valued-matched resistors (or current sources).
* The Successive-Approximation or Cyclic DAC,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.analog.com/media/en/training-seminars/design-handbooks/Data-Conversion-Handbook/Chapter3.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-08-30 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170830032212/http://www.analog.com/media/en/training-seminars/design-handbooks/Data-Conversion-Handbook/Chapter3.pdf |archivedate=2017-08-30 |df= }} p.&amp;nbsp;3.29&lt;/ref&gt; which successively constructs the output during each cycle.  Individual bits of the digital input are processed each cycle until the entire input is accounted for.
* The [[Thermometer code|thermometer-coded]] DAC, which contains an equal resistor or current-source segment for each possible value of DAC output. An 8-bit thermometer DAC would have 255 segments, and a 16-bit thermometer DAC would have 65,535 segments. This is perhaps the fastest and highest precision DAC architecture but at the expense of high cost. Conversion speeds of &gt;1 billion samples per second have been reached with this type of DAC.
* Hybrid DACs, which use a combination of the above techniques in a single converter. Most DAC integrated circuits are of this type due to the difficulty of getting low cost, high speed and high precision in one device.
** The segmented DAC, which combines the thermometer-coded principle for the most significant bits and the binary-weighted principle for the least significant bits. In this way, a compromise is obtained between precision (by the use of the thermometer-coded principle) and number of resistors or current sources (by the use of the binary-weighted principle). The full binary-weighted design means 0% segmentation, the full thermometer-coded design means 100% segmentation.
* Most DACs, shown earlier in this list,  rely on a constant reference voltage to create their output value. Alternatively, a ''multiplying DAC''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.analog.com/static/imported-files/overviews/AnalogMultiplyingDACs.pdf |title=Multiplying DACs, flexible building blocks |format=PDF |year=2010 |publisher=Analog Devices inc. |accessdate=29 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; takes a variable input voltage for their conversion. This puts additional design constraints on the bandwidth of the conversion circuit.

==Performance==

DACs are very important to system performance. The most important characteristics of these devices are:{{cn|date=August 2016}}
;Resolution: The number of possible output levels the DAC is designed to reproduce. This is usually stated as the number of [[bit]]s  it uses, which is the base two [[logarithm]] of the number of levels. For instance a 1 bit DAC is designed to reproduce 2 (2&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;) levels while an 8 bit DAC is designed for 256 (2&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;) levels. Resolution is related to the [[effective number of bits]] which is a measurement of the actual resolution attained by the DAC. Resolution determines [[color depth]] in video applications and [[audio bit depth]] in audio applications.
;Maximum [[sampling rate]]: A measurement of the maximum speed at which the DACs circuitry can operate and still produce the correct output. As stated above, the [[Nyquist–Shannon sampling theorem]] defines a relationship between this and the [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] of the sampled signal.
;[[monotonic function|Monotonicity]]: The ability of a DAC's analog output to move only in the direction that the digital input moves (i.e., if the input increases, the output doesn't dip before asserting the correct output.) This characteristic is very important for DACs used as a low frequency signal source or as a digitally programmable trim element.
;[[Total harmonic distortion]] and noise (THD+N): A measurement of the distortion and noise introduced to the signal by the DAC. It is expressed as a percentage of the total power of unwanted [[harmonic]] [[distortion]] and noise that accompany the desired signal. This is a very important DAC characteristic for dynamic and small signal DAC applications.
;[[Dynamic range]]: A measurement of the difference between the largest and smallest signals the DAC can reproduce expressed in [[decibel]]s. This is usually related to resolution and [[noise floor]].

Other measurements, such as [[phase distortion]] and [[jitter]], can also be very important for some applications, some of which (e.g. wireless data transmission, composite video) may even ''rely'' on accurate production of phase-adjusted signals.

Linear PCM audio sampling usually works on the basis of each bit of resolution being equivalent to 6 decibels of amplitude (a 2x increase in volume or precision).

Non-linear PCM encodings (A-law / μ-law, ADPCM, NICAM) attempt to improve their effective dynamic ranges by a variety of methods - logarithmic step sizes between the output signal strengths represented by each data bit (trading greater quantisation distortion of loud signals for better performance of quiet signals)

==Figures of merit==

* Static performance:
** [[Differential nonlinearity]] (DNL) shows how much two adjacent code analog values deviate from the ideal 1&amp;nbsp;LSB step.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maxim-ic.com/appnotes.cfm/appnote_number/641/ ADC and DAC Glossary - Maxim&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070308223113/http://www.maxim-ic.com/appnotes.cfm/appnote_number/641 |date=2007-03-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
** [[Integral nonlinearity]] (INL) shows how much the DAC transfer characteristic deviates from an ideal one.  That is, the ideal characteristic is usually a straight line; INL shows how much the actual voltage at a given code value differs from that line, in LSBs (1&amp;nbsp;LSB steps).
** Gain
** Offset
** Noise is ultimately limited by the [[Johnson-Nyquist noise|thermal noise]] generated by passive components such as resistors.  For audio applications and in room temperatures, such noise is usually a little less than 1 [[μV]] (microvolt) of [[white noise]]. This limits performance to less than 20~21 bits even in 24-bit DACs.
* Frequency domain performance
** [[Spurious-free dynamic range]] (SFDR) indicates in dB the ratio between the powers of the converted main signal and the greatest undesired spur.
** Signal-to-noise and distortion ratio (SNDR) indicates in dB the ratio between the powers of the converted main signal and the sum of the noise and the generated harmonic spurs
** i-th harmonic distortion (HDi) indicates the power of the i-th harmonic of the converted main signal
** [[Total harmonic distortion]] (THD) is the sum of the powers of all HDi
** If the maximum DNL error is less than 1 LSB, then the {{nowrap|D/A}} converter is guaranteed to be monotonic. However, many monotonic converters may have a maximum DNL greater than 1 LSB.
* Time domain performance:
** Glitch impulse area (glitch energy)
** Response uncertainty
** Time nonlinearity (TNL)

{{Manufacturing}}
A '''distributed control system''' ('''DCS''') is a computerised [[control system]] for a process or plant usually with a large number of [[control loop]]s, in which autonomous controllers are distributed throughout the system, but there is central operator supervisory control.  This is in contrast to systems that use centralized controllers; either discrete controllers located at a central control room or within a central computer. The DCS concept increases reliability and reduces installation costs by localising control functions near the process plant, with remote monitoring and supervision.  

Distributed control systems first emerged in large, high value, safety critical process industries, and were attractive because the DCS manufacturer would supply both the local control level and central supervisory equipment as an integrated package, thus reducing design integration risk. Today the functionality of [[SCADA]] and DCS systems are very similar, but DCS tends to be used on large continuous process plants where high reliability and security is important, and the control room is not geographically remote. 

==Structure==
[[File:Functional levels of a Distributed Control System.svg|thumb|500px|Functional levels of a manufacturing control operation]]
The key attribute of a DCS is its reliability due to the distribution of the control processing around nodes in the system. This mitigates a single processor failure. If a processor fails, it will only affect one section of the plant process, as opposed to a failure of a central computer which would affect the whole process. This distribution of computing power local to the field Input/Output (I/O) connection racks also ensures fast controller processing times by removing possible network and central processing delays. 

The accompanying diagram is a general model which shows functional manufacturing levels using computerised control.  

Referring to the diagram;

* Level 0 contains the field devices such as flow and temperature sensors, and final control elements, such as [[control valve]]s
* Level 1 contains the industrialised Input/Output (I/O) modules, and their associated distributed electronic processors.   
* Level 2 contains the supervisory computers, which  collect information from processor nodes on the system, and provide the operator control screens. 
* Level 3 is the production control level, which does not directly control the process, but is concerned with monitoring production and monitoring targets
* Level 4 is the production scheduling level. 

Levels 1 and 2 are the functional levels of a traditional DCS, in which all equipment are part of an integrated system from a single manufacturer. 

Levels 3 and 4 are not strictly [[process control]] in the traditional sense, but where production control and scheduling takes place.

===Technical points===
[[File:Smart current loop positioner.png|thumb|Example of a continuous flow control loop. Signalling is by industry standard 4–20&amp;nbsp;mA current loops, and a "smart" [[control valve|valve positioner]] ensures the [[control valve]] operates correctly.]]
The processor nodes and operator [[graphical user interface|graphical displays]] are connected over proprietary or industry standard networks, and network reliability is increased by dual redundancy cabling over diverse routes. This distributed topology also reduces the amount of field cabling by siting the I/O modules and their associated processors close to the process plant. 

The processors receive information from input modules, process the information and decide control actions to be signalled by the output modules. The field inputs and outputs can be [[analog signal|analog signals]] e.g. [[current loop|4–20&amp;nbsp;mA DC current loop]] or 2 state signals that switch either "on" or "off", such as relay contacts or a semiconductor switch.  

DCSs are connected to sensors and actuators and use [[Setpoint (control system)|setpoint control]] to control the flow of material through the plant.  A typical application is a [[PID controller]] fed by a flow meter and using a [[control valve]] as the final control element. The DCS sends the setpoint required by the process to the controller which instructs a valve to operate so that the process reaches and stays at the  desired setpoint. (see 4–20&amp;nbsp;mA schematic for example).

Large oil refineries and chemical plants have several thousand I/O points and employ very large DCS.  Processes are not limited to fluidic flow through pipes, however, and can also include things like [[paper machine]]s and their associated quality controls, [[Adjustable-speed drive|variable speed drives]] and [[Motor controller|motor control centers]], [[cement kiln]]s, [[Mining|mining operations]], [[Extractive metallurgy|ore processing]] facilities, and [[Et cetera|many others]]. 

DCSs in very high reliability applications can have dual redundant processors with "hot" switch over on fault, to enhance the reliability of the control system. 

Although 4–20&amp;nbsp;mA  has been the main field signalling standard, modern DCS systems can also support [[fieldbus]] digital protocols, such as Foundation Fieldbus, profibus, HART, Modbus, PC Link etc., and other digital communication protocols such as [[modbus]].

Modern DCSs also support [[Artificial neural network|neural networks]] and [[fuzzy logic]] applications. Recent research focuses on the synthesis of optimal distributed controllers, which optimizes a certain [[H-infinity methods in control theory|H-infinity]] or the H 2 control criterion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Distributed Control Design for Spatially Interconnected Systems|last = D'Andrea|first = Raffaello |date = 9 September 2003|journal = IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control|doi = 10.1109/tac.2003.816954 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Distributed Control for Identical Dynamically Coupled Systems: A Decomposition Approach|last = Massiaoni|first = Paolo|date = 1 January 2009|journal = IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control|doi = 10.1109/tac.2008.2009574 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Kontrollrom Tyssedal.jpg|thumb|A pre-DCS era central control room. Whilst the controls are centralised in one place, they are still discrete and not integrated into one system.]] 
[[File:Leitstand 2.jpg|thumb|A DCS control room where plant information and controls are displayed on computer graphics screens. The operators are seated as they can view and control any part of the process from their screens, whilst retaining a plant overview.]]

===Evolution of process control operations===
Process control of large industrial plants has evolved through many stages. Initially, control would be from panels local to the process plant. However this required a large manpower resource to attend to these dispersed panels, and there was no overall view of the process. The next logical development was the transmission of all plant measurements to a permanently-manned central control room. Effectively this was the centralisation of all the localised panels, with the advantages of lower manning levels and easier overview of the process. Often the controllers were behind the control room panels, and all automatic and manual control outputs were transmitted back to plant. However, whilst providing a central control focus, this arrangement was inflexible as each control loop had its own controller hardware, and continual operator movement within the control room was required to view different parts of the process. 

With the coming of electronic processors and graphic displays it became possible to replace these discrete controllers with computer-based algorithms, hosted on a network of input/output racks with their own control processors. These could be distributed around plant, and communicate with the graphic display in the control room or rooms. The distributed control system was born. 

The introduction of DCSs allowed easy interconnection and re-configuration of plant controls such as cascaded loops and interlocks, and easy interfacing with other production computer systems. It enabled sophisticated alarm handling, introduced automatic event logging, removed the need for physical records such as chart recorders, allowed the control racks to be networked and thereby located locally to plant to reduce cabling runs, and provided high level overviews of plant status and production levels.

===Origins===
Early [[minicomputer]]s were used in the control of industrial processes since the beginning of the 1960s.  The [[IBM 1800 Data Acquisition and Control System|IBM 1800]], for example, was an early computer that had input/output hardware to gather process signals in a plant for conversion from field contact levels (for digital points) and analog signals to the digital domain.

The first industrial control computer system was built 1959 at the Texaco Port Arthur, Texas, refinery with an [[TRW Inc.#Semiconductors and computers|RW-300]] of the [[TRW Inc.|Ramo-Wooldridge]] Company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

In 1975, both [[Honeywell]] and Japanese electrical engineering firm [[Yokogawa]] introduced their own independently produced DCS's - TDC 2000 and CENTUM systems, respectively. US-based Bristol also introduced their UCS 3000 universal controller in 1975. In 1978 [[Valmet]] introduced their own DCS system called Damatic (latest generation named Valmet DNA&lt;ref name="Valmet"&gt;[http://www.valmet.com/products/automation/valmet-dna-dcs/] Valmet DNA&lt;/ref&gt;). In 1980, Bailey (now part of ABB&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abb.com/controlsystems] INFI 90&lt;/ref&gt;) introduced the NETWORK 90 system,  Fisher Controls (now part of [[Emerson Electric]]) introduced the PROVoX system, [[Fischer &amp; Porter Company]] (now also part of ABB&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abb.com/product/us/9AAC115762.aspx] DCI-4000&lt;/ref&gt;) introduced DCI-4000 (DCI stands for Distributed Control Instrumentation).

The DCS largely came about due to the increased availability of microcomputers and the proliferation of microprocessors in the world of process control.  Computers had already been applied to process automation for some time in the form of both [[direct digital control]] (DDC) and setpoint control. In the early 1970s [[Taylor Instrument Company]], (now part of ABB) developed the 1010 system, Foxboro the FOX1 system, Fisher Controls the DC&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; system and [[Bailey Controls]] the 1055 systems.  All of these were DDC applications implemented within minicomputers ([[Digital Equipment Corporation|DEC]] [[PDP-11]], [[Varian Data Machines]], [[MODCOMP]] etc.) and connected to proprietary Input/Output hardware. Sophisticated (for the time) continuous as well as batch control was implemented in this way. A more conservative approach was setpoint control, where process computers supervised clusters of analog process controllers. A workstation provided visibility into the process using text and crude character graphics. Availability of a fully functional graphical user interface was a way away.

===Development===
Central to the DCS model was the inclusion of control function blocks. Function blocks evolved from early, more primitive DDC concepts of "Table Driven" software. One of the first embodiments of object-oriented software, function blocks were self-contained "blocks" of code that emulated analog hardware control components and performed tasks that were essential to process control, such as execution of PID algorithms.  Function blocks continue to endure as the predominant method of control for DCS suppliers, and are supported by key technologies such as Foundation Fieldbus&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fieldbus.org] Foundation Fieldbus&lt;/ref&gt; today.

[[Midac]] Systems, of Sydney, Australia, developed an objected-oriented distributed direct digital control system in 1982. The central system ran 11 microprocessors sharing tasks and common memory and connected to a serial communication network of distributed controllers each running two Z80s. The system was installed at the University of Melbourne.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

Digital communication between distributed controllers, workstations and other computing elements (peer to peer access) was one of the primary advantages of the DCS.  Attention was duly focused on the networks, which provided the all-important lines of communication that, for process applications, had to incorporate specific functions such as determinism and redundancy. As a result, many suppliers embraced the IEEE 802.4 networking standard. This decision set the stage for the wave of migrations necessary when information technology moved into process automation and IEEE 802.3 rather than IEEE 802.4 prevailed as the control LAN.

===The network-centric era of the 1980s===
In the 1980s, users began to look at DCSs as more than just basic process control. A very early example of a [[Direct Digital Control]] DCS was completed by the Australian business [[Midac]] in 1981–82 using R-Tec Australian designed hardware. The system installed at the [[University of Melbourne]] used a serial communications network, connecting campus buildings back to a control room "front end". Each remote unit ran two [[Z80]] microprocessors, while the front end ran eleven Z80s in a parallel processing configuration with paged common memory to share tasks and that could run up to 20,000 concurrent control objects.

It was believed that if openness could be achieved and greater amounts of data could be shared throughout the enterprise that even greater things could be achieved. The first attempts to increase the openness of DCSs resulted in the adoption of the predominant operating system of the day: ''UNIX''.  UNIX and its companion networking technology TCP-IP were developed by the US Department of Defense for openness, which was precisely the issue the process industries were looking to resolve.

As a result, suppliers also began to adopt Ethernet-based networks with their own proprietary protocol layers.  The full TCP/IP standard was not implemented, but the use of Ethernet made it possible to implement the first instances of object management and global data access technology.  The 1980s also witnessed the first [[programmable logic controller|PLCs]] integrated into the DCS infrastructure.  Plant-wide historians also emerged to capitalize on the extended reach of automation systems.  The first DCS supplier to adopt UNIX and Ethernet networking technologies was Foxboro, who introduced the I/A Series&lt;ref&gt;[http://iom.invensys.com/UK/Pages/Foxboro_DCSIASeries.aspx] Foxboro I/A Series Distributed Control System&lt;/ref&gt; system in 1987.

===The application-centric era of the 1990s===
The drive toward openness in the 1980s gained momentum through the 1990s with the increased adoption of [[commercial off-the-shelf]] (COTS) components and IT standards.  Probably the biggest transition undertaken during this time was the move from the UNIX operating system to the Windows environment.  While the realm of the real time operating system ([[RTOS]]) for control applications remains dominated by real time commercial variants of UNIX or proprietary operating systems, everything above real-time control has made the transition to Windows.

The introduction of Microsoft at the desktop and server layers resulted in the development of technologies such as [[OLE for process control|OLE for process control (OPC)]], which is now a de facto industry connectivity standard.  Internet technology also began to make its mark in automation and the  world, with most DCS HMI supporting Internet connectivity.  The 1990s were also known for the "Fieldbus Wars", where rival organizations competed to define what would become the IEC [[fieldbus]] standard for digital communication with field instrumentation instead of 4–20 milliamp analog communications.  The first fieldbus installations occurred in the 1990s.  Towards the end of the decade, the technology began to develop significant momentum, with the market consolidated around Ethernet I/P, Foundation Fieldbus and Profibus PA for process automation applications.  Some suppliers built new systems from the ground up to maximize functionality with fieldbus, such as [[Rockwell Automation|Rockwell]] PlantPAx System, [[Honeywell]] with [[Experion]] &amp; Plantscape [[SCADA]] systems, [[ABB Group|ABB]] with System 800xA,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abb.com/product/us/9AAC115756.aspx|title=ABB System 800xA - process, electrical, safety, telecoms in one system|website=www.abb.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Emerson Process Management&lt;ref&gt;[http://easydeltav.com] [[Emerson Process Management]]&lt;/ref&gt; with the [[Emerson Process Management]] [[DeltaV]] control system, [[Siemens]] with the SPPA-T3000&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.energy.siemens.com/hq/en/automation/power-generation/sppa-t3000.htm] SPPA-T3000&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Simatic PCS 7]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pcs.khe.siemens.com/index.aspx?nr%3D1075 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-03-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070329065215/http://pcs.khe.siemens.com/index.aspx?nr=1075 |archivedate=2007-03-29 |df= }} Simatic PCS 7&lt;/ref&gt; Forbes Marshall&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.forbesmarshall.com/fm_micro/DCS/Products1.aspx?flag=1&amp;id=dcs&amp;pid=551&amp;prodName=Microcon+%20Distributed%20Control%20System(DCS)] [[Forbes Marshall]]&lt;/ref&gt; with the Microcon+ control system and [[Azbil Corporation]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.azbil.com] Azbil Corporation&lt;/ref&gt; with the [[Harmonas-DEO]] system. Fieldbus technics have been used to integrate machine, drives, quality and [[condition monitoring]] applications to one DCS with Valmet DNA system.&lt;ref name="Valmet" /&gt;

The impact of COTS, however, was most pronounced at the hardware layer.  For years, the primary business of DCS suppliers had been the supply of large amounts of hardware, particularly I/O and controllers.  The initial proliferation of DCSs required the installation of prodigious amounts of this hardware, most of it manufactured from the bottom up by DCS suppliers.  Standard computer components from manufacturers such as Intel and Motorola, however, made it cost prohibitive for DCS suppliers to continue making their own components, workstations, and networking hardware.

As the suppliers made the transition to COTS components, they also discovered that the hardware market was shrinking fast.  COTS not only resulted in lower manufacturing costs for the supplier, but also steadily decreasing prices for the end users, who were also becoming increasingly vocal over what they perceived to be unduly high hardware costs. Some suppliers that were previously stronger in the [[programmable logic controller|PLC]] business, such as Rockwell Automation and Siemens, were able to leverage their expertise in manufacturing control hardware to enter the DCS marketplace with cost effective offerings, while the stability/scalability/reliability and functionality of these emerging systems are still improving. The traditional DCS suppliers introduced new generation DCS System based on the latest Communication and IEC Standards, which resulting in a trend of combining the traditional concepts/functionalities for PLC and DCS into a one for all solution—named "[[Process Automation System]]" (PAS). The gaps among the various systems remain at the areas such as: the database integrity, pre-engineering functionality, system maturity, communication transparency and reliability. While it is expected the cost ratio is relatively the same (the more powerful the systems are, the more expensive they will be), the reality of the automation business is often operating strategically case by case. The current next evolution step is called [[Collaborative Process Automation Systems]].

To compound the issue, suppliers were also realizing that the hardware market was becoming saturated.  The life cycle of hardware components such as I/O and wiring is also typically in the range of 15 to over 20 years, making for a challenging replacement market.  Many of the older systems that were installed in the 1970s and 1980s are still in use today, and there is a considerable installed base of systems in the market that are approaching the end of their useful life.  Developed industrial economies in North America, Europe, and Japan already had many thousands of DCSs installed, and with few if any new plants being built, the market for new hardware was shifting rapidly to smaller, albeit faster growing regions such as China, Latin America, and Eastern Europe.

Because of the shrinking hardware business, suppliers began to make the challenging transition from a hardware-based business model to one based on software and value-added services.  It is a transition that is still being made today.  The applications portfolio offered by suppliers expanded considerably in the '90s to include areas such as production management, model-based control, real-time optimization, plant asset management (PAM), Real-time performance management (RPM) tools, [[alarm management]], and many others.  To obtain the true value from these applications, however, often requires a considerable service content, which the suppliers also provide.

===Modern systems (2010 onwards)===
The latest developments in DCS include the following new technologies:

# [[Wireless]] systems and protocols
# [[Remote data transmission|Remote transmission]], logging and data historian
#  Mobile interfaces and controls
# [[Embedded HTTP server|Embedded web-servers]]

Increasingly, and ironically, DCS are becoming centralised at plant level, with the ability to log into the remote equipment. This enables operator to control both at enterprise level ( macro ) and at the equipment level (micro) both within and outside the plant as physical location due to interconnectivity primarily due to wireless and remote access has shrunk.

As wireless protocols are developed and refined, DCS increasingly includes wireless communication. DCS controllers are now often equipped with embedded servers and provide on-the-go web access. Whether DCS will lead IIOT or borrow key elements from remains to be established.

Many vendors provide the option of a mobile HMI, ready for both [[Android (operating system)|Android]] and [[iOS]]. With these interfaces, the threat of security breaches and possible damage to plant and process are now very real.

'''Dolby Digital''' is the name for audio compression technologies developed by [[Dolby Laboratories]]. Originally named '''[[Dolby Stereo]] Digital''' until [[1994 in film|1994]], except for Dolby TrueHD, the audio compression is [[lossy compression|lossy]]. The first use of Dolby Digital was to provide digital sound in cinemas from 35mm film prints; today, it is now also used for other applications such as TV broadcast, radio broadcast via satellite, [[DVD]]s,  [[Blu-ray]] discs and game consoles.

== In the cinema ==
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2011}}
''[[Batman Returns]]'' was the first film to use Dolby Digital technology when it premiered in theaters in the summer of 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/08/12/business/company-news-a-sound-idea-dolby-theater-format-adapted-to-home-uses.html?ref=dolbylaboratoriesinc |title=
COMPANY NEWS: A Sound Idea; Dolby Theater Format Adapted to Home Uses |publisher=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dolby Digital cinema soundtracks are optically recorded on a [[35 mm]] [[release print]] using sequential data blocks placed between every perforation hole on the sound track side of the film. A constant bit rate of 320 kbit/s is used. A [[charge-coupled device]] (CCD) scanner in the [[image projector]] picks up a scanned video image of this area, and a processor correlates the image area and extracts the digital data as an AC-3 [[bitstream]]. The data is then decoded into a 5.1 channel audio source. All film prints with Dolby Digital data also have [[Dolby Stereo]] analogue soundtracks using Dolby SR noise reduction and such prints are known as Dolby SR-D prints. The analogue soundtrack provides a fall-back option in case of damage to the data area or failure of the digital decoding; it also provides compatibility with projectors not equipped with digital soundheads. Almost all current release cinema prints are of this type and may also include [[Sony Dynamic Digital Sound|SDDS]] data and a timecode track to synchronize CD-ROMs carrying [[DTS (sound system)|DTS]] soundtracks.
[[File:Dolby Digital track reader.jpg|thumb|left|A Dolby Digital Penthouse Soundhead mounted on a mid-1950s vintage Kalee model 20 projector]]
[[File:35mm film audio macro.jpg|thumb|right|A photo of a 35 mm film print featuring all four audio formats (or ''quad track'')- from left to right: [[Sony Dynamic Digital Sound]] (SDDS) (blue area to the left of the sprocket holes), Dolby Digital (grey area between the sprocket holes labelled with the Dolby ''Double-D'' logo in the middle), analog optical sound (the two white lines to the right of the sprocket holes), and the [[DTS (sound system)|DTS]] [[time code]] (the dashed line to the far right.)]]

The simplest way of converting existing projectors is to add a so-called ''penthouse'' digital soundhead above the projector head. However, for new projectors it made sense to use dual analogue/digital soundheads in the normal optical soundhead position under the projector head. To allow for the dual-soundhead arrangement the data is recorded 26 frames ahead of the picture. If a penthouse soundhead is used, the data must be delayed in the processor for the required amount of time, around 2 seconds. This delay can be adjusted in steps of the time between perforations, (approximately 10.4 ms).

{{As of|2018}}, Dolby Digital in film sound mixing is being gradually replaced with [[Dolby Surround 7.1]], with the more advanced [[Dolby Atmos]] technology also gaining in popularity. While majority of movie theaters currently utilize Dolby Digital, virtually all films released today are mixed in Dolby Surround 7.1 and Dolby Atmos.

===Dolby Digital===
[[File:Dolbytrailerdvd07.png|thumb|right|Dolby Digital logo that is sometimes shown at the start of broadcasts, feature films, and video games]]
[[File:Dolby Digital old logo.svg|thumb|The former Dolby Digital logo]]
Dolby Digital is the common version containing up to six discrete channels of sound. The most elaborate mode in common use involves five channels for normal-range speakers ({{nowrap|20 Hz – 20,000 Hz}}) (right, center, left, right surround, left surround) and one channel ({{nowrap|20 Hz – 120 Hz}} allotted audio) for the [[subwoofer]] driven [[low-frequency effects]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.dolby.com/uploadedFiles/Assets/US/Doc/Professional/42_DDFAQ.pdf|title=Dolby-Frequently Asked Questions |publisher=[[Dolby Laboratories]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[monaural|Mono]] and [[stereophonic sound|stereo]] modes are also supported. AC-3 supports audio sample-rates up to 48&amp;nbsp;kHz.

This format has different names:
* Dolby Digital
* DD (an abbreviation for Dolby Digital, often combined with channel count; for instance, DD 2.0, DD 5.1)
* AC-3 (Audio Codec 3, Advanced Codec 3, Acoustic Coder 3. [These are [[backronym]]s. [[ATRAC3|Adaptive Transform Acoustic Coding 3]] is a separate format developed by [[Sony]].])&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.sony.com/ |title=Sony USA |publisher=[[Sony]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[ATSC (standards)|ATSC]] A/52 (name of the standard)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.atsc.org/cms/index.php/standards/published-standards/48-atsc-a52-standard |title=A/52B: Digital Audio Compression (AC-3) (E-AC-3) Standard, Rev.

In 1991, a limited experimental release of ''[[Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country]]'' in Dolby Digital played in 3 US theatres.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In 1992, ''[[Batman Returns]]'' is the first movie to be released in Dolby Digital.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.dolby.com/us/en/about/history.html|title=History: 50 YEARS OF INNOVATION|last=|first=|date=|website=Dolby Laboratories|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1992-05-13/features/9202120272_1_batman-returns-format-analog|title=`Batman Returns` To Try Double Dolby|last=|first=|date=May 13, 1992|work=The Chicago Tribune|access-date=2017-03-22|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995, the [[LaserDisc]] version of ''[[Clear and Present Danger (film)|Clear and Present Danger]]'' featured the first [[home cinema|home theater]] Dolby Digital mix, quickly followed by ''[[True Lies]]'', ''[[Stargate (film)|Stargate]]'', ''[[Forrest Gump]]'', and ''[[Interview with the Vampire (film)|Interview with the Vampire]]'' among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lddb.com/list.php?format=ld&amp;list=ac3&amp;start=75&amp;sort=date,asc|title=Laserdisc Database Search By Date|last=|first=|date=|website=Laserdisc Database|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lddb.com/laserdisc/21521/LV-32463-2WS/Clear-and-Present-Danger|title=LaserDisc Database Clear and Present Danger|last=|first=|date=|website=LaserDisc Database|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Dolby Digital EX ===
Dolby Digital EX is similar in practice to Dolby's earlier [[Dolby Pro Logic|Pro-Logic]] format, which utilized [[matrix (sound recording)|matrix]] technology to add a [[center surround channel]] and single rear surround channel to stereo soundtracks. EX adds an extension to the standard [[5.1]] channel Dolby Digital codec in the form of matrixed rear channels, creating [[Surround sound|6.1]] or 7.1 channel output.

===Dolby Digital Surround EX ===
It provides an economical and backwards-compatible means for 5.1 soundtracks to carry a sixth, center back surround channel for improved localization of effects. The [[extra surround channel]] is matrix encoded onto the discrete ''left surround'' and ''right surround'' channels of the 5.1 mix, much like the front [[center channel]] on Dolby Pro Logic encoded stereo soundtracks. The result can be played without loss of information on standard 5.1 systems, or played in 6.1 or 7.1 on systems with Surround EX decoding and added speakers.
Dolby Digital Surround EX has since been used for the ''[[Star Wars]]'' prequels on the DVD versions and also the remastered original ''Star Wars'' trilogy. A number of DVDs have a Dolby Digital Surround EX audio option.

The cinema version of ''Dolby Digital EX'' was introduced in 1999, when Dolby and [[Skywalker Sound]], a division of [[Lucasfilm Ltd.]], codeveloped ''Dolby Digital Surround EX''™ for the release of ''[[Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace]]''.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://investor.dolby.com/ReleaseDetail.cfm?releaseid=164165|title=Dolby Launches Dolby Digital Cinema in Theatres Worldwide with Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith|last=|first=|date=|website=Dolby Investor Relations|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dolby Digital Surround EX has since been used for the ''Star Wars'' prequels on the DVD versions and also the remastered original ''Star Wars'' trilogy.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
[[File:Dolby Near.JPG|thumb|upright|A Dolby home theater badge on a laptop]]

=== Dolby Digital Live ===
Dolby Digital Live (DDL) is a real-time encoding technology for interactive media such as video games. It converts any audio signals on a PC or game console into a 5.1-channel 16-bit/48&amp;nbsp;kHz Dolby Digital format at 640 kbit/s and transports it via a single [[S/PDIF]] cable.&lt;ref name=DDL&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.dolby.com/consumer/technology/dolby_live.html |title=Dolby Digital Live |publisher=[[Dolby Laboratories]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar technology known as [[DTS (sound system)#DTS Connect|DTS Connect]] is available from competitor [[DTS (sound system)|DTS]]. An important benefit of this technology is that it enables the use of digital multichannel sound with consumer sound cards, which are otherwise limited to digital [[Pulse-code modulation|PCM]] stereo or analog multichannel sound because S/PDIF over RCA, BNC, and TOSLINK can only support two-channel PCM, Dolby Digital multichannel audio, and DTS multichannel audio. [[HDMI]] was later introduced, and it can carry uncompressed multichannel PCM, lossless compressed multichannel audio, and lossy compressed digital audio. However, Dolby Digital Live is still useful with HDMI to allow transport of multichannel audio over HDMI to devices that are unable to handle uncompressed multichannel PCM.

Dolby Digital Live is available in sound cards using various manufacturers' audio chipsets. The [[SoundStorm]], used for the [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]] game console and certain [[nForce2]] motherboards, used an early form of this technology. DDL is available on motherboards with codecs such as [[Realtek]]'s ALC882D,&lt;ref name=ddl882&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.anandtech.com/printarticle.aspx?i=2773 |title=Nvidia nForce 500: Biostar and MSI Aim for the Gold |publisher=[[AnandTech]]| first=Gary | last=Key| date=June 8, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; ALC888DD and ALC888H. Other examples include some [[C-Media]] PCI sound cards and Creative Labs' X-Fi and Z series sound cards, whose drivers have enabled support for DDL.

NVIDIA later decided to drop DDL support in their motherboards due to the cost of involved royalties, leaving an empty space in this regard in the sound cards market.
Then in June 2005 came [[Auzentech]], which with its X-Mystique PCI card, provided the first consumer sound card with Dolby Digital Live support.

Initially no Creative X-Fi based sound cards supported DDL (2005~2007) but a collaboration of Creative and [[Auzentech]] resulted in the development of the Auzentech Prelude, the first X-Fi card to support DDL. Originally planned to extend DDL support to all X-Fi based sound cards (except the 'Xtreme Audio' line which is incapable of DDL hardware implementation), the plan was dropped because Dolby licensing would have required a royalty payment for all X-Fi cards and, problematically, those already sold.&lt;ref name="DDL license issue of X-Fi"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.parkoz.com/zboard/view.php?id=dm_audio_qna&amp;no=15261 |title=A Korean reply comment (the fifth), which explains Dolby license royalty issue of X-Fi.

In 2008, Creative released the X-Fi Titanium series of sound cards which fully supports Dolby Digital Live while leaving all PCI versions of Creative X-Fi still lacking support for DDL.

Since September 2008, all Creative X-Fi based sound cards support DDL (except the 'Xtreme Audio' and its based line such as Prodigy 7.1e, which is incapable of DDL in hardware). [[X-Fi (audio chip)|X-Fi]]'s case differs.

While they forgot about the plan, programmer Daniel Kawakami made a hot issue by applying Auzentech Prelude DDL module back to Creative X-Fi cards by disguising the hardware identity as Auzentech Prelude.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.parkoz.com/zboard/view.php?id=dm_audio_qna&amp;no=12661 |title=What Daniel_K wrote to the public is "This utility was written from scratch and does not contain any copyrighted code. Creative's director of developer relations, George Thorn told me, in a chat session, that is OK to provide mods as patches. It does not modify any executable or DLL, so it is NOT a crack." Daniel_K's driver MOD itself did not include any DDL module, until it began to support Creative's official DDL pack. Daniel_K's 'DDLUnlocker.exe' merely used disguise to install Auzentech Prelude DDL module}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Creative Labs alleged Kawakami violated their intellectual property and demanded he cease distributing his modified drivers.

Eventually Creative struck an agreement with Dolby Laboratories regarding the Dolby license royalty by arranging that the licensing cost be folded into the purchase price of the Creative X-Fi PCI cards rather than as a royalty paid by Creative themselves.&lt;ref name="DDL license issue of X-Fi"/&gt; Based on the agreement, in September 2008 Creative began selling the ''Dolby Digital Live'' packs enabling Dolby Digital Live on Creative's X-Fi PCI series of sound cards.

=== Dolby Digital Plus ===
{{Main|Dolby Digital Plus}}
E-AC-3 (Dolby Digital Plus) is an enhanced coding system based on the AC-3 [[codec]]. It offers increased [[bitrate]]s (up to 6.144 Mbit/s), support for even more [[audio channel]]s (up to 15.1 discrete channels&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.dolby.com/us/en/technologies/dolby-digital-plus-audio-coding-tech-paper.pdf|title=Dolby Digital Plus Audio Coding Tech Paper|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the future), and improved coding techniques (only at low data rates) to reduce [[compression artifacts]], enabling lower data rates than those supported by AC-3 (e.g. 5.1-channel audio at 256 kbit/s). It is not backward compatible with existing AC-3 hardware, though E-AC-3 [[codec]]s generally are capable of [[transcoding]] to AC-3 for equipment connected via [[S/PDIF]]. E-AC-3 decoders can also decode AC-3 bitstreams. The fourth generation Apple TV supports E-AC-3.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.apple.com/tv/specs/|title=Apple TV - Tech Specs|publisher=|accessdate=1 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The discontinued [[HD DVD]] system directly supported E-AC-3. [[Blu-ray Disc]] offers E-AC-3 as an option to [[wikt:graft|graft]] added channels onto an otherwise [[5.1 surround sound|5.1]] AC-3 stream, as well as for delivery of secondary audio content (e.g. director's commentary) that is intended to be mixed with the primary audio soundtrack in the Blu-ray Disc player.

=== Dolby AC-4 ===
{{main|Dolby AC-4}}

Dolby AC-4 is an audio compression standard supporting multiple audio channels and/or audio objects. Support for 5.1 channel audio is mandatory and additional channels up to 7.1.4 are optional.&lt;ref name=DolbyAC4ServicesJune2015Dolby&gt;{{cite news |title=Dolby AC-4: Audio Delivery for Next-Generation Entertainment Services |publisher=[[Dolby Laboratories]] |url=http://www.dolby.com/us/en/technologies/ac-4/Next-Generation-Entertainment-Services.pdf |format=PDF |date=2015-06-01 |accessdate=2016-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; AC-4 provides a 50% reduction in bit rate over AC-3/[[Dolby Digital Plus]].&lt;ref name=DolbyAC4ServicesJune2015Dolby/&gt;

=== Dolby TrueHD ===
{{Main|Dolby TrueHD}}
Dolby TrueHD, developed by Dolby Laboratories, is an advanced lossless audio codec based on [[Meridian Lossless Packing]]. Support for the codec was mandatory for HD DVD and is optional for [[Blu-ray Disc]] hardware. Dolby TrueHD supports 24-bit bit depths and sample rates up to 192 kHz. Maximum bitrate is 18 MBit/s while it supports up to 16 audio channels (HD DVD and Blu-ray Disc standards currently limit the maximum number of audio channels to eight). It supports metadata, including dialog normalization and Dynamic Range Control.

== Channel configurations ==
Although commonly associated with the 5.1 channel configuration, Dolby Digital allows a number of different channel selections. The options are:

* Dolby Digital 1/0 - Mono (center only)
* Dolby Digital 2/0 - 2-channel stereo (left + right), optionally carrying matrixed Dolby Surround
* Dolby Digital 3/0 - 3-channel stereo (left, center, right)
* Dolby Digital 2/1 - 2-channel stereo with mono surround (left, right, surround)
* Dolby Digital 3/1 - 3-channel stereo with mono surround (left, center, right, surround)
* Dolby Digital 2/2 - 4-channel quadraphonic (left, right, left surround, right surround)
* Dolby Digital 3/2 - [[5.1 surround sound|5-channel surround]] (left, center, right, left surround, right surround)

These configurations optionally include the extra [[low-frequency effects]] (LFE) channel. The last two with stereo surrounds optionally use Dolby Digital EX matrix encoding to add an extra Rear Surround channel.

Many Dolby Digital decoders are equipped with [[downmixing]] to distribute encoded channels to speakers. This includes such functions as playing surround information through the front speakers if surround speakers are unavailable, and distributing the [[center channel]] to left and right if no center speaker is available. When outputting to separate equipment over a 2-channel connection, a Dolby Digital decoder can optionally encode the output using Dolby Surround to preserve surround information.

The '.1' in 5.1, 7.1 etc. refers to the LFE channel, which is also a discrete channel.

== Applications ==
Dolby Digital audio is used on DVD-Video and other purely digital media, like home cinema. In this format, the AC-3 bitstream is interleaved with the video and control bitstreams.

The system is used in bandwidth-limited applications other than DVD-Video, such as digital TV. The AC-3 standard allows a maximum coded bit rate of 640&amp;nbsp;kbit/s. 35mm film prints use a fixed rate of 320&amp;nbsp;kbit/s, which is the same as the maximum bit rate for 2-channel [[MP3]]. DVD-Video discs are limited to 448&amp;nbsp;kbit/s, although many players can successfully play higher-rate bitstreams (which are non-compliant with the DVD specification). HD&amp;nbsp;DVD limits AC-3 to 448&amp;nbsp;kbit/s. [[ATSC Standards|ATSC]] and digital cable standards limit AC-3 to 448&amp;nbsp;kbit/s. Blu-ray Disc, the PlayStation 3 and the Xbox game console can output an AC-3 signal at a full 640 kbit/s. Some Sony PlayStation 2 console games are able to output AC-3 standard audio as well, primarily during pre-rendered cutscenes.

Dolby is part of a group of organizations involved in the development of [[Advanced Audio Coding|AAC]] (Advanced Audio Coding), part of MPEG specifications, and considered the successor to MP3.

Dolby Digital Plus (DD-Plus) and TrueHD are supported in HD DVD, as mandatory codecs, and in Blu-ray Disc, as optional codecs.

==Technical details==
The data layout of AC-3 is described by simplified "[[C (programming language)|C]]-like" language in official specifications. An AC-3 stream is a series of frames; The frame size code is used along with the sample rate code to determine the number of (2-byte)
words before the next syncword. Channel blocks can be either long, in which case the entire block is processed as single [[modified discrete cosine transform]] or short, in which case two half length transforms are performed on the block. Below is a simplified AC-3 header.

Audio codec AC3 is covered by patents (though these are now expired&lt;ref&gt;https://ac3freedomday.org/&lt;/ref&gt;). Patents are used to ask to pay a commercial license to publish an application that decodes AC3.

An '''electronic speed control''' or '''ESC''' is an [[electronic circuit]] that controls and regulates the speed of an [[electric motor]]. It may also provide reversing of the motor and [[dynamic brake|dynamic braking]].
Miniature electronic speed controls are used in electrically powered [[radio controlled model]]s.  Full-size electric vehicles also have systems to control the speed of their drive motors.  


== Function ==
An electronic speed control follows a speed reference signal (derived from a throttle lever, joystick, or other manual input)  and varies the switching rate of a network of [[field effect transistor]]s (FETs)   .&lt;ref&gt;http://www.stefanv.com/electronics/escprimer.html&lt;/ref&gt;   By [[Pulse-width modulation|adjusting the duty cycle]] or switching frequency of the transistors, the speed of the motor is changed. The rapid switching of the transistors is what causes the motor itself to emit its characteristic high-pitched whine, especially noticeable at lower speeds. 

Different types of speed controls are required for [[brushed DC motor]]s and [[brushless DC motor]]s.  A brushed motor can have its speed controlled by varying the voltage on its armature. (Industrially, motors with electromagnet field windings instead of permanent magnets can also have their speed controlled by adjusting the strength of the motor field current.)  A brushless motor requires a different operating principle.  The speed of the motor is varied by adjusting the timing of pulses of current delivered to the several windings of the motor. 

[[File:ESC 35A.jpg|thumb|A generic ESC module rated at 35 amperes with an integrated [[Battery eliminator circuit|BEC]]]]

Brushless ESC systems basically create [[Three-phase electric power|three-phase ]] AC power, as in a [[variable frequency drive]] , to run [[brushless motor]]s.  Brushless motors are popular with  [[radio controlled airplane]] hobbyists because of their efficiency, power, longevity and light weight in comparison to traditional brushed motors.  Brushless AC motor controllers are much more complicated than brushed motor controllers.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rcmodelswiz.co.uk/electronic-speed-controllers-esc/ RC Models Wiz: Essential Guide to Electric Speed Control Systems.&lt;/ref&gt;

The correct phase varies with the motor rotation, which is to be taken into account by the ESC:  Usually, [[back EMF]] from the motor is used to detect this rotation, but variations exist that use magnetic ([[Hall effect]]) or optical detectors.  Computer-programmable speed controls generally have user-specified options which allow setting low voltage cut-off limits, timing, acceleration, braking and direction of rotation.  Reversing the motor's direction may also be accomplished by switching any two of the three leads from the ESC to the motor.

== Classification ==
ESCs are normally rated according to maximum [[electric current|current]], for example, 25 [[ampere]]s or 25&amp;nbsp;A. Generally the higher the rating, the larger and heavier the ESC tends to be which is a factor when calculating mass and balance in airplanes. Many modern ESCs support [[nickel metal hydride]], [[lithium ion polymer]] and [[lithium iron phosphate]] batteries with a range of input and cut-off voltages. The type of battery and number of cells connected is an important consideration when choosing a [[battery eliminator circuit]] (BEC), whether built into the controller or as a stand-alone unit. A higher number of cells connected will result in a reduced power rating and therefore a lower number of servos supported by an integrated BEC, if it uses a linear voltage regulator. A well designed BEC using a switching regulator should not have a similar limitation.

== Vehicle applications ==

===Electric cars===
Large, high-current ESCs are used in electric cars, such as the [[Nissan Leaf]], [[Tesla Roadster (2008)]], [[Tesla Model S|Model S]], [[Tesla Model X|Model X]], [[Tesla Model 3|Model 3]], and the [[Chevrolet Bolt]]. The energy draw is usually measured in kilowatts (the Nissan Leaf, for instance, uses an 80 kilowatt motor that produces 210 foot-pounds of torque). Most mass-produced electric cars use AC motors, which allow the ESC to capture energy when the car coasts, using the motor as a generator and slowing the car down. The captured energy is used to charge the batteries and thus extend the driving range of the car (this is known as [[Regenerative brake|regenerative braking]]). In some vehicles, such as those produced by Tesla, this can be used to slow down so effectively that the car's conventional brakes are only needed at very low speeds (the motor braking effect diminishes as the speed is reduced). In others, such as the Nissan Leaf, there is only a slight "drag" effect when coasting, and the ESC modulates the energy capture in tandem with the conventional brakes to bring the car to a stop.
[[File:President Rouhani driving an electronic car 03.jpg|100 * 100px|thumb|right|Electronic car]]

Some custom-built electric cars (usually built by enthusiasts using the chassis, body and transmission of an existing vehicle) use DC motors instead of AC, because of their lower cost and simpler wiring. However, DC motors cannot be used for regenerative braking, so these vehicles cannot travel as far on the same battery, all other factors being equal. DC motors also cannot safely run at RPMs as high as AC motors can, so many custom-built electric cars retain a multi-speed transmission of some kind. Since electric motors have full torque from zero RPM, the vehicle can still start off in a high gear, but starting in a lower gear allows for quicker acceleration, lower current draw and less wear and tear on the motor. This is a limited view of the system; in fact the current and the proportional torque is limited by the batteries and / or the power devices used to control the motor so that a transmission could be beneficial to increase torque at low vehicle speeds just like a gasoline fueled one. However it is usually easier to increase the motor size so that the maximum torque is acceptable since the weight of a transmission can be equal to the motor. 

ESCs used in mass-produced electric cars with AC motors usually have reversing capability, allowing the motor to run in both directions. The car has only one gear ratio, and the motor simply runs in the opposite direction to make the car go in reverse. Some custom-built electric cars with DC motors also have this feature, using an electrical switch to reverse the direction of the motor, but others run the motor in the same direction all the time and use a traditional manual or automatic transmission to reverse direction (usually this is easier, since the vehicle used for the conversion already has the transmission, and the electric motor is simply installed in place of the original engine).

===Electric bicycles ===
[[File:Datteln - KF2011 - Hafenstraße 21 ies.jpg|100*100px|thumb|right|Electronic bicycle]]

A motor used in an [[electric bicycle]] application requires high initial torque and therefore uses Hall sensor commutation for speed measurement. Electric bicycle controllers generally use brake application sensors, pedal rotation sensors and provide  potentiometer-adjustable motor speed, [[Control theory#Closed-loop transfer function|closed-loop]] speed control for precise speed regulation, protection logic for over-voltage, over-current, and thermal protection. Sometimes pedal torque sensors are used to enable motor assist proportional to applied torque and sometimes support is provided for [[Regenerative brake|regenerative braking]] but infrequent braking and the low mass of bicycles limits recovered energy. An implementation is described in an &lt;ref&gt;&lt;/font&gt;

'''P.A.S''' or '''PAS''' may appear within the list of components of electric conversion kits for bicycles which implies ''Pedal Assistance Sensor'' or sometimes ''Pulse Pedal Assistance Sensor''. Pulse usually relates to a magnet and sensor which measures the rotational velocity of the crank. Pedal pressure sensors under the feet are possible but not common.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.docstoc.com/docs/51547130/Pedal-Power-Sensor-And-Human-Powered-Vehicle-Drive-Augmentation-Responsive-To-Cyclic-Pedal-Power-Input---Patent-5992553 USA Patent 5992553&lt;/ref&gt;



== Remote control applications ==


An ESC can be a stand-alone unit which plugs into the receiver's throttle control channel or incorporated into the receiver itself, as is the case in most toy-grade R/C vehicles.  Some R/C manufacturers that install proprietary hobby-grade electronics in their entry-level vehicles, vessels or aircraft use onboard electronics that combine the two on a single [[circuit board]].


Electronic speed controls for model RC vehicles  may incorporate a [[battery eliminator circuit]]  to regulate voltage for the [[receiver (radio)|receiver]], removing the need for separate receiver batteries. The regulator may be  [[linear regulator|linear]] or [[Switching regulator|switched mode]]. ESCs, in a broader sense, are [[Pulse-width modulation|PWM]] controllers for electric motors. The ESC generally accepts a nominal 50&amp;nbsp;Hz PWM servo input signal whose pulse width varies from 1&amp;nbsp;ms to 2 ms. When supplied with a 1 ms width pulse at 50&amp;nbsp;Hz, the ESC responds by turning off the motor attached to its output. A 1.5&amp;nbsp;ms pulse-width input signal drives the motor at approximately half-speed. When presented with 2.0&amp;nbsp;ms input signal, the motor runs at full speed.

=== Cars ===
ESCs designed for sport use in [[Radio-controlled car|cars]] generally have reversing capability; newer sport controls can have the reversing ability overridden so that it can not be used in a race.  Controls designed specifically for racing and even some sport controls have the added advantage of dynamic braking capability.  The ESC forces the motor to act as a [[Electrical generator|generator]] by placing an electrical load across the armature.  This in turn makes the [[armature (electrical engineering)|armature]] harder to turn, thus slowing or stopping the model.  Some controllers add the benefit of [[regenerative braking]].

=== Helicopters ===

[[File:Remote controlled flying machine with four helicopter blades.jpg|20*20px|thumb|right|Drone]]

ESCs designed for radio-control helicopters do not require a braking feature (since the one way bearing would render it useless anyhow) nor do they require reverse direction (although it can be helpful since the motor wires can often be difficult to access and change once installed).

Many high-end  helicopter ESCs provide a "[[Governor (device)|Governor]] mode" which fixes the motor RPM to a set speed, greatly aiding [[Cyclic/collective pitch mixing|CCPM]]-based flight. It is also used in quadcopters.

=== Airplanes ===
ESCs designed for radio-control airplanes usually contain a few safety features. If the power coming from the battery is insufficient to continue running the electric motor the ESC will reduce or cut off power to the motor while allowing continued use of [[ailerons]], [[rudder]] and [[Elevator (aircraft)|elevator]] function. This allows the [[Aviator|pilot]] to retain control of the [[airplane]] to [[glide (flight)|glide]] or fly on low power to safety.

=== Boats ===
ESCs designed for boats are by necessity waterproof. The watertight structure is significantly different from that of non-marine type ESCs, with a more packed air trapping enclosure. Thus arises the need to cool the motor and ESC effectively to prevent rapid failure. Most marine-grade ESCs are cooled by circulated water run by the motor, or negative propeller vacuum near the drive shaft output. Like car ESCs, boat ESCs have braking and reverse capability.

===Quadcopters===
'''Electronic Speed Controllers''' (ESC) are an essential component of modern quadcopters (and all multirotors) that offer high power, high frequency, high resolution 3-phase AC power to the motors in an extremely compact miniature package. These craft depend entirely on the variable speed of the motors driving the propellers. This wide variation and fine RPM control in motor/prop speed gives all of the control necessary for a quadcopter (and all multirotors) to fly.

Quadcopter ESCs usually can use a faster update rate compared to the standard 50&amp;nbsp;Hz signal used in most other RC applications. A variety of ESC protocols beyond PWM are utilized for modern-day multirotors, including, Oneshot42, Oneshot125, Multishot, and DShot. DShot is a digital protocol that offers a certain advantages over classical analog control, such as higher resolution, CRC checksums, and a lack of oscillator drift (removing the need for calibration).  Modern day ESCs protocols can communicate at speeds of 37.5KHz or greater, with DSHOT2400 frame only taking 6.5μs.&lt;ref&gt;https://oscarliang.com/dshot/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.flyduino.net/en_US/shop/product/pr2200-kiss-esc-2-6s-32a-32bit-brushless-motor-ctrl-2961&lt;/ref&gt;

== ESC firmware ==
Most modern ESC contain a microcontroller interpreting the input signal and appropriately controlling the motor using a built-in program, or firmware. In some cases it is possible to change the factory built-in firmware for an alternate, publicly available, open source firmware. This is done generally to adapt the ESC to a particular application. Some ESCs are factory built with the capability of user upgradable firmware. Others require soldering to connect a programmer.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7555">A '''floating landing platform''' is a large [[marine environment|marine]] floating structure used to land [[launch vehicle]] [[booster (rocketry)|booster stages]].  

This is a fairly new phenomena after 2013 as all early [[orbital spaceflight|orbital]] launch vehicle stages were [[Expendable launch system|expended]], with booster stages returning through the atmosphere to certain destruction on contact with either land or sea.  Since that time, two [[private spaceflight|private]] companies are developing reusable launch vehicle technology and using, or planning to use, floating landing platforms.

== History == 

After attempts to land orbital rocket booster stages by [[parachute]] failed in the late 2000s, [[SpaceX]] began to [[New product development|develop]] [[reusable launch system|reusable technology]] in the early 2010s.  By mid-decade, [[Blue Origin]] was following, with a commitment to land the booster of a large launch vehicle on a moving ship.

=== Fixed location floating platforms ===

{{main|Autonomous spaceport drone ship}}&lt;!-- the ASDS is the first and only example of a floating landing platform used at a fixed location --&gt;

In the 2010s, [[Space Exploration Technologies]] (SpaceX) contracted with a [[Louisiana]] [[shipyard]] to build a floating landing platform for [[reusable launch vehicle|reusable]] [[orbital spaceflight|orbital]] [[launch vehicle]]s. The platform had an approximately {{convert|90|x|50|m|sp=us}} landing pad surface and was capable of precision [[Dynamic positioning|positioning]] with [[Diesel engine|diesel-powered]] [[azimuth thruster]]s&lt;ref name=tm20141122&gt;{{cite web|title=SpaceX Announces Spaceport Barge Positioned by Thrustmaster’s Thrusters|url=http://www.thrustmaster.net/spacex-announces-spaceport-barge-positioned-thrustmasters-thrusters/|publisher=Thrustmaster|accessdate=23 November 2014|date=22 November 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141207091326/http://www.thrustmaster.net/out-drive-propulsion-unit/portable-dynamic-positioning-system/|archivedate=7 December 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; so the platform can hold its position for launch vehicle landing.

SpaceX CEO [[Elon Musk]] first displayed a photograph of the newly designated "[[autonomous spaceport drone ship]]" in November 2014. The ship is designed to hold position to within {{convert|3|m|sp=us}}, even under storm conditions.&lt;ref name=musk20141122&gt;{{cite web|last1=Musk|first1=Elon|title=Autonomous spaceport drone ship|url=https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/536262624653365248|publisher=SpaceX|accessdate=23 November 2014|date=22 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 8 April 2016, the first stage of the rocket that launched the [[SpaceX Dragon|Dragon]] [[SpaceX CRS-8|CRS-8]] spacecraft, successfully landed on the drone ship named ''Of Course I Still Love You,'' the first successful landing of a rocket booster on a floating platform.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://phenomena.nationalgeographic.com/2016/04/08/spacex-rocket-makes-spectacular-landing-on-drone-ship/ |title=SpaceX Rocket Makes Spectacular Landing on Drone Ship |website=Phenomena |access-date=10 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
By early 2018, SpaceX had two operational drone ships and had a third under construction.  By September 2018, sea platform landings had become routine for the SpaceX [[Falcon (rocket family)|Falcon launch vehicles]], with over 23 attempted and 17 successful recoveries.&lt;ref name=nsf20180719&gt;

=== Underway ship landing platforms ===

{{main|Blue Origin landing platform ship}}&lt;!-- the Blue ship currently being refit is the first and only example of a floating landing platform intended to be used while the ship is underway, after 2020 --&gt;

{{asof|2018}}, [[Blue Origin]] is intending to make the first stage boosters of [[New Glenn]] be [[reusable launch vehicle|reusable]], and recover launched boosters on the [[Atlantic Ocean]], downrange of their [[Blue Origin Florida launch facility|Florida launch site]], via a stabilized [[Blue Origin landing platform ship|ship]] that is [[underway]], acting as a moving floating landing platform.  The [[Stabilizer (ship)|hydrodynamically-stabilized]] ship is projected to increase the likelihood of successful recovery in [[sea state|rough seas]].  The first recovery from an orbital launch by Blue is expected around 2020.&lt;ref name=nsf20180920&gt;

A '''gyrocompass''' is a type of non-magnetic [[compass]] which is based on a fast-spinning disc and the rotation of the [[Earth]] (or another planetary body if used elsewhere in the universe) to find geographical [[Direction (geometry)|direction]] automatically. The use of a gyrocompass can be considered to be one out of seven fundamental ways to determine the heading of a vehicle.&lt;ref name=”JournalOfNavigation2016”&gt;{{cite journal |last= Gade |first= Kenneth |year= 2016 |title= The Seven Ways to Find Heading |journal= The Journal of Navigation |publisher= Cambridge University Press |volume= 69 |issue= 5 |pages=955–970 |url=http://www.navlab.net/Publications/The_Seven_Ways_to_Find_Heading.pdf | format=PDF |doi= 10.1017/S0373463316000096 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although one important component of a gyrocompass is a [[gyroscope]], these are not the same devices; a gyrocompass is built to use the effect of [[gyroscopic precession]], which is a distinctive aspect of the general [[gyroscopic effect]].&lt;ref name=an&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VJ3WCpegQxwC|title=The Anschutz Gyro-Compass and Gyroscope Engineering|pages=7–24|isbn=978-1-929148-12-7|author1=Elliott-Laboratories|date=2003|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170304174125/https://books.google.com/books?id=VJ3WCpegQxwC|archivedate=2017-03-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=l&gt;{{cite journal|title=The gyroscope pilots ships &amp; planes|journal=Life|date=Mar 15, 1943|pages=80–83|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YlEEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA82|author=Time Inc.|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170227154326/https://books.google.com/books?id=YlEEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA82|archivedate=2017-02-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Gyrocompasses are widely used for [[navigation]] on [[ship]]s, because they have two significant advantages over [[magnetic compass]]es:&lt;ref name=l /&gt;
* they find [[true north]] as determined by the axis of the [[Earth's rotation]], which is different from, and navigationally more useful than,  [[Magnetic North Pole#Magnetic north and magnetic declination|''magnetic'' north]], and
* they are unaffected by [[ferromagnetic]] materials, such as in a ship's [[steel]] [[hull (watercraft)|hull]], which distort the [[magnetic field]].

Aircraft commonly use gyroscopic instruments (but not a gyrocompass) for navigation and altitude monitoring; for details, see [[Flight instruments]] and [[Gyroscopic autopilot]].

== Operation ==
A [[gyroscope]], not to be confused with gyrocompass, is a spinning wheel mounted on a set of [[gimbals]] so that its axis is free to orient itself in any way.&lt;ref name=l /&gt; When it is spun up to speed with its axis pointing in some direction, due to the law of conservation of [[angular momentum]], such a wheel will normally maintain its original orientation to a fixed point in [[outer space]] (not to a fixed point on Earth). Since our planet rotates, it appears to a stationary observer on Earth that a gyroscope's axis is completing a full rotation once every 24 hours.&lt;ref group=note&gt;Although the effect is not visible in the specific case when the gyroscope's axis is precisely parallel to the Earth's rotational axis.&lt;/ref&gt; Such a rotating gyroscope is used for navigation in some cases, for example on aircraft, where it is known as  [[heading indicator]] or directional gyro, but cannot ordinarily be used for long-term marine navigation. The crucial additional ingredient needed to turn a gyroscope into a gyrocompass, so it would automatically position to true north,&lt;ref name=an /&gt;&lt;ref name=l /&gt; is some mechanism that results in an [[torque|application of torque]] whenever the compass's axis is not pointing north.

One method uses [[friction]] to apply the needed torque:&lt;ref name="maritime.org"&gt;[http://www.maritime.org/fleetsub/elect/chap17.htm Gyrocompass, Auxiliary Gyrocompass, and Dead Reckoning Analyzing Indicator and Tracer Systems] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130601030840/http://www.maritime.org/fleetsub/elect/chap17.htm |date=2013-06-01 }}, San Francisco Maritime National Park Association.&lt;/ref&gt; the gyroscope in a gyrocompass is not completely free to reorient itself; if for instance a device connected to the axis is immersed in a viscous fluid, then that fluid will resist reorientation of the axis. This friction force caused by the fluid results in a [[torque]] acting on the axis, causing the axis to turn in a direction orthogonal to the torque (that is, to [[precess]]) along a [[line of longitude]].  Once the axis points toward the celestial pole, it will appear to be stationary and won't experience any more frictional forces. This is because true north (or true south) is the only direction for which the gyroscope can remain on the surface of the earth and not be required to change. This axis orientation is considered to be a point of minimum [[potential energy]].

Another, more practical, method is to use weights to force the axis of the compass to remain horizontal (perpendicular to the direction of the center of the Earth), but otherwise allow it to rotate freely within the horizontal plane.&lt;ref name=an /&gt;&lt;ref name=l /&gt; In this case, gravity will apply a torque forcing the compass's axis toward true north.  Because the weights will confine the compass's axis to be horizontal with respect to the Earth's surface, the axis can never align with the Earth's axis (except on the Equator) and must realign itself as the Earth rotates.  But with respect to the Earth's surface, the compass will appear to be stationary and pointing along the Earth's surface toward the true North Pole.

Since the gyrocompass's north-seeking function depends on the rotation around the axis of the Earth that causes [[Gyroscopic precession#Torque-induced|torque-induced gyroscopic precession]], it will not orient itself correctly to true north if it is moved very fast in an east to west direction, thus negating the Earth's rotation. However, aircraft commonly use [[Heading indicator|heading indicators or directional gyros]], which are not gyrocompasses and do not align themselves to north via precession, but are periodically aligned manually to magnetic north.&lt;ref&gt;NASA [http://asrs.arc.nasa.gov/publications/callback/cb_304.htm NASA Callback: Heading for Trouble] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716165805/http://asrs.arc.nasa.gov/publications/callback/cb_304.htm |date=2011-07-16 }}, NASA Callback Safety Bulletin website, December 2005, No. 305.

== Mathematical model ==
We consider a gyrocompass as a gyroscope which is free to rotate about one of its symmetry axes, also the whole rotating gyroscope is free to rotate on the horizontal plane about the local vertical. Therefore there are two independent local rotations. In addition to these rotations we consider the rotation of the Earth about its north-south (NS) axis, and we model the planet as a perfect sphere. We neglect friction and also the rotation of the Earth about the Sun.

In this case a non-rotating observer located at the center of the Earth can be approximated as being an inertial frame. We establish cartesian coordinates &lt;math&gt;\textstyle (X_{1},Y_{1},Z_{1})&lt;/math&gt; for such an observer (whom we name as 1-O), and the barycenter of the gyroscope is located at a distance &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; from the center of the Earth.

=== First time-dependent rotation ===
Let us consider another (non-inertial) observer (the 2-O) located at the center of the Earth but rotating about the NS-axis by &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\Omega&lt;/math&gt;. We establish coordinates attached to this observer as

:&lt;math&gt;
\left(\begin{array}{c}
X_{2}\\
Y_{2}\\
Z_{2}
\end{array}\right)=\left(\begin{array}{ccc}
\cos\Omega t &amp; \sin\Omega t &amp; 0\\
-\sin\Omega t &amp; \cos\Omega t &amp; 0\\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1
\end{array}\right)\left(\begin{array}{c}
X_{1}\\
Y_{1}\\
Z_{1}
\end{array}\right),
&lt;/math&gt;

so that the unit &lt;math&gt;\hat{X}_{1}&lt;/math&gt; versor &lt;math&gt;(X_{1}=1,Y_{1}=0,Z_{1}=0)^{T}&lt;/math&gt; is mapped to the point &lt;math&gt;(X_{2}=\cos\Omega t,Y_{2}=-\sin\Omega t,Z_{2}=0)^{T}&lt;/math&gt;. For the 2-O neither the Earth nor the barycenter of the gyroscope is moving. The rotation of 2-O relative to 1-O is performed with angular velocity &lt;math&gt;\vec{\Omega}=(0,0,\Omega)^{T}&lt;/math&gt;. We suppose that the &lt;math&gt;X_{2}&lt;/math&gt; axis denotes points with zero longitude (the prime, or Greenwich, meridian).

=== Second and third fixed rotations ===
We now rotate about the &lt;math&gt;\textstyle Z_{2}&lt;/math&gt; axis, so that the &lt;math&gt;\textstyle X_{3}&lt;/math&gt;-axis has the longitude of the barycenter. In this case we have

:&lt;math&gt;\left(\begin{array}{c}
X_{3}\\
Y_{3}\\
Z_{3}
\end{array}\right)=\left(\begin{array}{ccc}
\cos\Phi &amp; \sin\Phi &amp; 0\\
-\sin\Phi &amp; \cos\Phi &amp; 0\\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1
\end{array}\right)\left(\begin{array}{c}
X_{2}\\
Y_{2}\\
Z_{2}
\end{array}\right).&lt;/math&gt;

With the next rotation (about the axis &lt;math&gt;\textstyle Y_{3}&lt;/math&gt; of an angle &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \delta&lt;/math&gt;, the co-latitude) we bring the &lt;math&gt;\textstyle Z_{3}&lt;/math&gt; axis along the local zenith (&lt;math&gt;\textstyle Z_{4}&lt;/math&gt;-axis) of the barycenter. This can be achieved by the following orthogonal matrix (with unit determinant)

:&lt;math&gt;\left(\begin{array}{c}
X_{4}\\
Y_{4}\\
Z_{4}
\end{array}\right)=\left(\begin{array}{ccc}
\cos\delta &amp; 0 &amp; -\sin\delta\\
0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0\\
\sin\delta &amp; 0 &amp; \cos\delta
\end{array}\right)\left(\begin{array}{c}
X_{3}\\
Y_{3}\\
Z_{3}
\end{array}\right),&lt;/math&gt;

so that the &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\hat{Z}_{3}&lt;/math&gt; versor &lt;math&gt;\textstyle (X_{3}=0,Y_{3}=0,Z_{3}=1)^{T}\,&lt;/math&gt; is mapped to the point &lt;math&gt;\textstyle (X_{4}=-\sin\delta,Y_{4}=0,Z_{4}=\cos\delta)^{T}\,&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Constant translation ===
We now choose another coordinate basis whose origin is located at the barycenter of the gyroscope. This can be performed by the following translation along the zenith axis

:&lt;math&gt;\left(\begin{array}{c}
X_{5}\\
Y_{5}\\
Z_{5}
\end{array}\right)=\left(\begin{array}{c}
X_{4}\\
Y_{4}\\
Z_{4}
\end{array}\right)-\left(\begin{array}{c}
0\\
0\\
R
\end{array}\right)\,,&lt;/math&gt;

so that the origin of the new system, &lt;math&gt;(X_{5}=0,Y_{5}=0,Z_{5}=0)^{T}&lt;/math&gt; is located at the point &lt;math&gt;(X_{4}=0,Y_{4}=0,Z_{4}=R)^{T}&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is the radius of the Earth. Now the &lt;math&gt;X_{5}&lt;/math&gt;-axis points towards the south direction.

=== Fourth time-dependent rotation ===
Now we rotate about the zenith &lt;math&gt;Z_{5}&lt;/math&gt;-axis so that the new coordinate system is attached to the structure of the gyroscope, so that for an observer at rest in this coordinate system, the gyrocompass is only rotating about its own axis of symmetry. In this case we find

:&lt;math&gt;\left(\begin{array}{c}
X_{6}\\
Y_{6}\\
Z_{6}
\end{array}\right)=\left(\begin{array}{ccc}
\cos\alpha &amp; \sin\alpha &amp; 0\\
-\sin\alpha &amp; \cos\alpha &amp; 0\\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1
\end{array}\right)\left(\begin{array}{c}
X_{5}\\
Y_{5}\\
Z_{5}
\end{array}\right).&lt;/math&gt;

The axis of symmetry of the gyrocompass is now along the &lt;math&gt;X_{6}&lt;/math&gt;-axis.

=== Last time-dependent rotation ===
The last rotation is a rotation on the axis of symmetry of the gyroscope as in

:&lt;math&gt;\left(\begin{array}{c}
X_{7}\\
Y_{7}\\
Z_{7}
\end{array}\right)=\left(\begin{array}{ccc}
1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\
0 &amp; \cos\psi &amp; \sin\psi\\
0 &amp; -\sin\psi &amp; \cos\psi
\end{array}\right)\left(\begin{array}{c}
X_{6}\\
Y_{6}\\
Z_{6}
\end{array}\right).&lt;/math&gt;

=== Dynamics of the system ===
Since the height of the gyroscope's barycenter does not change (and the origin of the coordinate system is located at this same point), its gravitational potential energy is constant. Therefore its Lagrangian &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}&lt;/math&gt; corresponds to its kinetic energy &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; only. We have

:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}=K=\frac{1}{2}\,\vec{\omega}^{T}I\vec\omega+\frac{1}{2}\,M \vec{v}_{\rm CM}^{\,2}\,,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is the mass of the gyroscope, &lt;math&gt;\vec{v}_{\rm CM}^{\,2}=\Omega^2 R^2 \sin^2\delta={\rm constant}&lt;/math&gt; is the squared inertial speed of the origin of the coordinates of the final coordinate system (i.e. the center of mass). This constant term does not affect the dynamics of the gyroscope and it can be neglected. On the other hand, the tensor of inertia is given by

:&lt;math&gt;I=\left(\begin{array}{ccc}
I_{1}&amp;0&amp;0\\
0 &amp; I_{2}&amp;0\\
0 &amp;0  &amp; I_{2}
\end{array}\right)\,,&lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\vec{\omega}&amp;=\left(\begin{array}{ccc}
1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\
0 &amp; \cos\psi &amp; \sin\psi\\
0 &amp; -\sin\psi &amp; \cos\psi
\end{array}\right)\left(\begin{array}{c}
\dot{\psi}\\
0\\
0
\end{array}\right)+\left(\begin{array}{ccc}

\Omega(-\sin\delta\sin\alpha\sin\psi+\cos\delta\cos\psi)
\end{array}\right).\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore we find

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\mathcal{L}&amp;=\frac{1}{2}\,[I_{1}\omega_{1}^{2}+I_{2}(\omega_{2}^{2}+\omega_{3}^{2})]\\
 &amp;= \frac{1}{2}\, I_{1}(\dot{\psi}-\Omega\sin\delta\cos\alpha)^{2}
  {}+\frac{1}{2}\, I_{2}\{[\dot{\alpha}\sin\psi+\Omega(\sin\delta\sin\alpha\cos\psi+\cos\delta\sin\psi)]^{2}
  {}+[\dot{\alpha}\cos\psi+\Omega(-\sin\delta\sin\alpha\sin\psi+\cos\delta\cos\psi)]^{2}\}\\
 &amp;= \frac{1}{2}\, I_{1}(\dot{\psi}-\Omega\sin\delta\cos\alpha)^{2}+\frac{1}{2}\, I_{2}\{\dot{\alpha}^{2}+\Omega^{2}(\cos^{2}\delta+\sin^{2}\alpha\sin^{2}\delta)
  {}+2\dot{\alpha}\Omega\cos\delta\}.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The Lagrangian can be rewritten as

:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}=\mathcal{L}_{1}+\frac{1}{2}\, I_{2}\Omega^{2}\cos^{2}\delta+\frac{d}{dt}(I_{2}\alpha\Omega\cos\delta)\,,&lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}_{1}=\frac{1}{2}\, I_{1}(\dot{\psi}-\Omega\sin\delta\cos\alpha)^{2}+\frac{1}{2}\, I_{2}\,(\dot{\alpha}^{2}+\Omega^{2}\sin^{2}\alpha\sin^{2}\delta)&lt;/math&gt;

is the part of the Lagrangian responsible for the dynamics of the system. Then, since &lt;math&gt;\partial \mathcal{L}_1/\partial\psi=0&lt;/math&gt;, we find

:&lt;math&gt;L_{x}\equiv\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}_{1}}{\partial\dot{\psi}}=I_{1}(\dot{\psi}-\Omega\sin\delta\cos\alpha)=\mathrm{constant}.&lt;/math&gt;

Since the angular momentum &lt;math&gt;\vec L&lt;/math&gt; of the gyrocompass is given  by &lt;math&gt;\vec L=I\vec\omega&lt;/math&gt;, we see that the constant &lt;math&gt;L_x&lt;/math&gt; is the component of the angular momentum about the axis of symmetry. Furthermore, we find the equation of motion for the variable &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; as

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dt}\!\left(\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}_{1}}{\partial\dot{\alpha}}\right)=\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}_{1}}{\partial\alpha}\,,&lt;/math&gt;

or

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
I_{2}\ddot{\alpha} &amp;=I_{1}\Omega(\dot{\psi}-\Omega\sin\delta\cos\alpha)\sin\delta\sin\alpha+\frac{1}{2}\, I_{2}\,\Omega^{2}\sin^{2}\delta\sin2\alpha\\
&amp;=L_{x}\Omega\sin\delta\sin\alpha+\frac{1}{2}\, I_{2}\,\Omega^{2}\sin^{2}\delta\sin2\alpha\,.\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

==== Particular case: the poles ====
At the poles we find &lt;math&gt;\sin\delta=0&lt;/math&gt;, and the equations of motion become

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
L_{x} &amp;=I_{1}\dot{\psi}=\mathrm{constant}\\
I_{2}\ddot{\alpha}&amp;=0\,.\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

This simple solution implies that the gyroscope is uniformly rotating with constant angular velocity in both the vertical and symmetrical axis.

==== The general and physically relevant case ====
Let us suppose now that &lt;math&gt;\sin\delta\neq0&lt;/math&gt; and that &lt;math&gt;\alpha\approx0&lt;/math&gt;, that is the axis of the gyroscope is approximately along the north-south line, and let us find the parameter space (if it exists) for which the system admits stable small oscillations about this same line. If this situation occurs, the gyroscope will always be approximately aligned along the north-south line, giving direction. In this case we find

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
L_{x}&amp;\approx I_{1}(\dot{\psi}-\Omega\sin\delta)\,,\\
I_{2}\ddot{\alpha}&amp;\approx (L_{x}\Omega\sin\delta+I_{2}\,\Omega^{2}\sin^{2}\delta)\,\alpha\,.\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Let us consider the case that

:&lt;math&gt;
L_{x}&lt;0\,,&lt;/math&gt;

and, further, we allow for fast gyro-rotations, that is

:&lt;math&gt;|\dot{\psi}|\gg\Omega\,.&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore, for fast spinning rotations, &lt;math&gt;L_x&lt;0&lt;/math&gt; implies &lt;math&gt;\dot\psi&lt;0&lt;/math&gt;. In this case, the equations of motion further simplify to

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
L_{x}&amp;\approx -I_{1}|\dot{\psi}|\approx\mathrm{constant}\,,\\
I_{2}\ddot{\alpha}&amp;\approx -I_{1}|\dot{\psi}|\Omega\sin\delta\,\alpha\,.\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore we find small oscillations about the north-south line, as &lt;math&gt;\alpha\approx A\sin(\tilde\omega t+B)&lt;/math&gt;, where the angular velocity of this harmonic motion of the axis of symmetry of the gyrocompass about the north-south line is given by

:&lt;math&gt;\tilde\omega=\sqrt{\frac{I_{1}\sin\delta}{I_{2}}}\,\sqrt{|\dot{\psi}|\Omega}\,,&lt;/math&gt;

which corresponds to a period for the oscillations given by

:&lt;math&gt;T=\frac{2\pi}{\sqrt{|\dot{\psi}|\Omega}}\,\sqrt{\frac{I_{2}}{I_{1}\sin\delta}}\,.&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore &lt;math&gt;\tilde\omega&lt;/math&gt; is proportional to the geometric mean of the Earth and spinning angular velocities. In order to have small oscillations we have required &lt;math&gt;\dot{\psi}&lt;0&lt;/math&gt;, so that the North is located along the right-hand-rule direction of the spinning axis, that is along the negative direction of the &lt;math&gt;X_7&lt;/math&gt;-axis, the axis of symmetry. As a side result, on measuring &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; (and knowing &lt;math&gt;\dot{\psi}&lt;/math&gt;), one can deduce the local co-latitude &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt;.

The company is today Raytheon Anschütz GmbH.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ihk-schleswig-holstein.de/news/ihk_kiel12955/Hermann-Anschuetz-Kaempfe/3405026 Chambers of Commerce and Industry in Schleswig-Holstein] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170222061044/https://www.ihk-schleswig-holstein.de/news/ihk_kiel12955/Hermann-Anschuetz-Kaempfe/3405026 |date=2017-02-22 }} Retrieved on February 22, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; The gyrocompass was an important invention for nautical navigation because it allowed accurate determination of a vessel’s location at all times regardless of the vessel’s motion, the weather and the amount of steel used in the construction of the ship.&lt;ref name="maritime.org" /&gt; 

In the United States, [[Elmer Ambrose Sperry]] produced a workable gyrocompass system (1908: patent #1,242,065), and founded the [[Sperry Corporation|Sperry Gyroscope Company]]. The unit was adopted by the U.S. Navy (1911&lt;ref name=l /&gt;), and played a major role in World War I. The Navy also began using Sperry's "Metal Mike": the first gyroscope-guided autopilot steering system. In the following decades, these and other Sperry devices were adopted by steamships such as the [[RMS Queen Mary]], airplanes, and the warships of World War II. After his death in 1930, the Navy named the [[USS Sperry|USS ''Sperry'']] after him.

Meanwhile, in 1913, C. Plath (a Hamburg, Germany-based manufacturer of navigational equipment including sextants and magnetic compasses) developed the first gyrocompass to be installed on a commercial vessel.  C. Plath sold many gyrocompasses to the Weems’ School for Navigation in Annapolis, MD, and soon the founders of each organization formed an alliance and became Weems &amp; Plath.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.weems-plath.com/weems-and-plath-story.php The Invention of Precision Navigational Instruments for Air and Sea Navigation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718024746/http://www.weems-plath.com/weems-and-plath-story.php |date=2011-07-18 }}, Weems &amp; Plath.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:1889 Gymnote Gyroscope.jpg|thumb|The 1889 Dumoulin-Krebs gyroscope]]
Before the success of the gyrocompass, several attempts had been made in Europe to use a gyroscope instead. By 1880, [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|William Thomson]] (Lord Kelvin) tried to propose a gyrostat (tope) to the British Navy. In 1889, [[Arthur Krebs]] adapted an electric motor to the Dumoulin-Froment marine gyroscope, for the French Navy. That gave the ''Gymnote'' submarine the ability to keep a straight line while underwater for several hours, and it allowed her to [http://rbmn.free.fr/Gymnote_Blocus_1890.jpg force a naval block] in 1890.

In 1923 [[Max Schuler]] published his paper containing his observation that if a gyrocompass possessed [[Schuler tuning]] such that it had an oscillation period of 84.4 minutes (which is the orbital period of a notional satellite orbiting around the Earth at sea level), then it could be rendered insensitive to lateral motion and maintain directional stability.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Introduction to avionics systems |first=R.

== Errors ==
A gyrocompass is subject to certain errors. These include steaming error, where rapid changes in course, speed and [[latitude]] cause [[Magnetic deviation|deviation]] before the gyro can adjust itself.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.navis.gr/navaids/gyro.htm Gyrocompass: Steaming Error] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081222083129/http://www.navis.gr/navaids/gyro.htm |date=2008-12-22 }}, Navis.

'''Sir Herbert Henry Merrett''' (1886 – 3 October 1959) was a Welsh [[Business magnate|industrialist]].

==Career==
Herbert Merrett grew up and was educated in [[Cardiff]]. He began his career in the [[Cardiff Docks]] with [[Cory Brothers]], initially a junior, though be later became the company's general chairman and director when it merged with [[PD Ports|Powell Duffryn Ltd]] in 1947 as a result of [[Nationalization|nationalisation]]. Herbert was a director of Powell Duffryn from 1940, having previously been director of [[Clydach Vale|Blaenclydach]] Colliery (c.1923-1937), Troedyrhiw Coal (c.1923-1933) Company and D.R. Llewellyn &amp; Sons (c. 1923-1933) and chairman of Graigola Merthyr Company (c.1923-1933). His other positions include chairman and managing director of [[Crynant]] Colliery (c.1933-1940) and director of North's Navigation Collieries (c.1940-1950). By 1930, he also was managing director of his own company, Gueret, Llewellyn &amp; Merrett Ltd.

In 1932, Herbert published a book entitled ''I fight for coal'', describing his early experiences in the Welsh coal industry. Herbert was [[Justice of the peace|Justice of the Peace]] for [[Glamorgan]]shire and [[High Sheriff of Glamorgan|High Sheriff]] 1934-35. In 1935-36, he served as president of Cardiff Incorporated Chamber of Commerce. He later became president of the British Coal Exporters' Federation 1946-49. In 1950 he was knighted and in that same year received an award from France of [[Legion of Honour|Chevalier de la Légion d'Honneur]], having established associations within Europe.

==Sports==
Merrett was an avid footballer in his youth and played for the amateur team the [[Cardiff Corinthians F.C.|Cardiff Corinthians]]. He became a qualified referee and was chairman of the [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City Association Football Club]] 1939-1957, barring one short break. He was also president of the [[Glamorgan County Cricket Club]].

==Personal life==
Merrett was born in [[Canton, Cardiff|Canton]] parish, Cardiff on 18 December 1886, the son of Lewis and Elizabeth Merrett. In 1911, he married Marion Linda Higgins who bore him two daughter and a son. Merrett's grandson is Alan Chalmers, who ran security at Wimbledon for 40 years.

Merrett died on 3 October 1959.

[[File:Different Hexcentrics.jpg|thumb|Different kinds of hexes]]
A '''hex''' is an item of rock [[climbing equipment]] used to protect climbers from falls.  They are intended to be wedged into a crack or other opening in the rock, and do not require a hammer to place.  They were developed as an alternative to [[piton]]s, which are hammered into cracks and are more prone to damage the rock.  Most commonly, a [[carabiner]] will be used to join the hex to the climbing rope by means of a loop of webbing, cord or a cable which is part of the hex.

Hexes are a type of [[nut (climbing)|nut]], a hollow eccentric hexagonal prism with tapered ends, usually threaded with [[webbing]], a [[swaged]] cable, or a cord. They are manufactured by several firms, with a range of sizes varying from about {{convert|10|-|100|mm|in|sigfig=1}} wide. Climbers select a range of sizes to use on a specific climb based on the characteristics of the cracks in the rock encountered on that particular climb.  Sides may be straight or curved although the functioning principles remain the same no matter which shape is selected; the lack of sharp corners on curved models may make them easier to remove from the rock.&lt;ref name="freedom"&gt;{{cite book |edition=7 |editor=Cox, Steven M. |editor2=Kris Fulsaas, ed. |title=[[Mountaineering: The Freedom of the Hills]] |publisher=The Mountaineers |isbn = 0-89886-828-9 |location=Seattle |date=September 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hexes may be placed either as passive or active protection. When placed passively they work like chock stones in flared cracks, like other climbing nuts, just larger and with a different shape. Active protection is achieved by orienting the webbing so that a pull causes a camming action against the rock similar to [[Tricam]]s, allowing for placement in parallel cracks. They are often preferred by alpine mountaineers over [[spring-loaded camming device]]s because of their lack of moving parts and overall lower weight for the same size crack.

The original hexes were invented by [[Yvon Chouinard]] and [[Tom Frost]], and called ''Hexentrics''.  The "polycentric" hexentric was designed by Swedish/Norwegian climber Tomas Carlstrom and given to Chouinard Equipment in 1973. They applied for a U. S. patent in 1974 and it was granted on April 6, 1976.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/patents?id=DMQvAAAAEBAJ&amp;pg=PA1&amp;lpg=PA1&amp;dq=U.+S.+Patent+3,948,485&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=8nyYTjrmT5&amp;sig=vn8JlkCwCF3ai7ctH_0jPrMI59g&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=ooctS5qxGI-wsgPe8vmJBA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=8&amp;ved=0CCIQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=U.%20S.%20Patent%203%2C948%2C485&amp;f=false|title=Irregular, Polygonal Mountaineering Chock 3,948,485|last=Chouinard|first=Yvon|author2=Frost, Tom|date=April 6, 1976|publisher=United States Patent Office|accessdate=20 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hexes were produced by Chouinard Equipment, Ltd until 1989, when it was sold as a design to [[Black Diamond Equipment]].

'''''History of the Kinetograph, Kinetoscope, and Kinetophonograph''''' is a book written by siblings [[William Kennedy Dickson]] and Antonia Dickson about the history of film. The brother Dickson wrote from his experiences working for [[Thomas Edison]] at his "[[Edison's Black Maria|Black Maria]]" studio in [[West Orange, New Jersey|West Orange]], New Jersey; Edison himself prefaced the book. Emphasis is placed on the eponymous devices: the [[kinetograph]], the [[kinetoscope]], and the [[The Dickson Experimental Sound Film|kinetophonograph]]. Dickson helped to develop these devices, which facilitate the capturing and [[Film distribution|exhibition]] of motion pictures.

Considered the first book of history on the subject of film, it was published in 1895 as a [[monograph]]. The [[Museum of Modern Art]] acquired the book in 1940 and later reprinted it in 1970 and 2000. The book has been received positively by literary critics and film scholars, who saw it as a valuable primary source and early look at the film industry. 

==Conception and contents==
''History of the Kinetograph, Kinetoscope, and Kinetophonograph'' is a collection of essays on the history of film, written by the motion picture pioneer [[William Kennedy Dickson]] and his sister Antonia Dickson.{{Sfn|Anonymous|2002}} The brother Dickson had lived in England before moving to the United States in 1879. In 1883, at age 23, Dickson earned the employment of [[Thomas Edison]] at his [[Edison Machine Works|Machine Works]] company in New York City.{{Sfn|Dickson|1895|p=55}} In 1888, Edison commissioned Dickson for the development of what would become the [[kinetoscope]], an early means of playing back motion picture film.{{Sfn|Marcus|2010|p=45}} Dickson moved later to Edison's "[[Edison's Black Maria|Black Maria]]" film production studio in [[West Orange, New Jersey|West Orange]], New Jersey; the bulk of ''History'' recounts his experiences working at this studio.{{Sfn|Jacobs|1971|p=78}}

The 55-page [[monograph]] contains 54 illustrations rendered by William.{{Sfn|Anonymous|2002}} The mechanics of primordial [[Movie camera|motion picture camera]]s and [[Film distribution|exhibition]] are explained,{{Sfn|Jacobs|1971|p=78}} with eponymous emphasis given to the [[kinetograph]], the kinetoscope, and the [[The Dickson Experimental Sound Film|kinetophonograph]]. Dickson worked with Edison on the development of these devices, which respectively capture pictures on film, play films back, and combine picture with sound.{{Sfn|Côté|2001|p=89}} Antonia and William give credit to the other architects of film and their works, as well as the performers and subjects who star in those works.{{Sfn|Jacobs|1971|p=78}} A preface penned by Edison appears at the book's start.{{Sfn|Anonymous|2002}}

==Reception==
''History'' was published first in 1895.{{Sfn|Jacobs|1971|p=78}} An early version of the book's contents appeared in the June 1894 issue of ''[[The Century Magazine]]''.{{Sfn|Marcus|2010|p=45}} That year, the siblings had published a biography of Edison.{{Sfn|Marcus|2010|p=53}} For the time of its publishing, the book served as not only a history of film but also as advertisement and a directory pertaining to the subjects in the films addressed in it.{{Sfn|Marcus|2010|p=46}} The book fell out of knowledge since until the [[Museum of Modern Art]] acquired a copy in 1940. The museum's Film Library division gave it a [[reprint]]ing thirty years later, in 1970; Arno Press published this reprinting in association with the [[The New York Times Company|New York Times Company]].{{Efn|The book was included in the publisher's ''Literature of Cinema'' series {{Harvard citation|Côté|2001|p=88}}.}}{{Sfn|Jacobs|1971|p=78}} The book received another reprinting in 2000, this time published by the museum itself.{{Efn|The museum captured William's illustrations using the [[duotone]] printing process {{Harvard citation|Anonymous|2002}}.}}{{Sfn|Anonymous|2002}}

The book is considered by scholars of the medium the first published history on the subject of film,{{Sfnm|1a1=Bawden|1y=1976|1p=193|2a1=Côté|2y=2001|2p=88}} with the art critic [[Nancy Mowll Mathews]] calling it unprecedented.{{Sfn|Mathews|2005|p=148}} The historian [[Lewis Jacobs]] called the book important as a [[primary source]] for the history of early film. From the authors' combined tone, Jacobs perceived the Dicksons' excitement at having the privilege to observe popular film actors and to have worked in his industry at its infancy.{{Sfn|Jacobs|1971|p=78}} Jacobs defined the book as "intimate" and its closing words as an "eloquent prediction" on the expansion of kinetograph technology.{{Sfn|Jacobs|1971|pp=78–79}} Jacobs recommended the book for film scholars and historians for its wisdom and its emphasis on the beginning of film as both a technology and as an art form.{{Sfn|Jacobs|1971|p=79}} The literary critic Laura Marcus found the book's scientific approach in tension with its purpose to market but conceded that the eponymous devices had a psychic nature intrinsically.{{Sfn|Marcus|2010|p=46}} Marcus noted the harmony of the Dicksons' view of film as both uncanny and natural and of their opinion of the "Black Maria" as both a nursery and a laboratory like that depicted in ''[[Frankenstein]]''.{{Sfn|Marcus|2010|pp=46–47}} Despite the book's promotional tone, Marcus called its imagery and motifs influential in shaping subsequent publications about film.{{Sfn|Marcus|2010|p=52}}

Stéphanie Côté of the ''[[Journal of Film Preservation]]'' recommended the book for its importance as well but noted the difficulty of the brother Dickson's writing. Côté called the sister Dickson's style similarly flamboyant.{{Sfn|Côté|2001|p=89}} The film critic [[David Thomson (film critic)|David Thomson]] regarded the book's prose as "plummy" from the brother Dickson's admiration for the film industry.{{Sfn|Thomson|2001|p=43}} Mathews called Dickson's front cover illustration mediocre but convincing.{{Sfn|Mathews|2005|p=148}}

The '''in vivo bioreactor (IVB)''' is a [[regenerative medicine]] paradigm where bone is grown in vivo. The IVB has basic elements:
# Creation of a confined environment in vivo that is adjacent to a tissue locality rich in pluripotent cells,
# Injection of a Hydrogel Biomaterial with the appropriate physicochemical and biophysical characteristics in this confined environment so as to predictably alter the signaling environment or trigger a process within this confined environment leading to recapitulation of developmental processes and de novo formation of a functional tissue mass, and
# The harvest of the tissue from the confined site and transplantation of this tissue into another site within the patient, leading to a complete autologous tissue engineering strategy.

An example of the implementation of the IVB approach was in the engineering of autologous [[bone]] by injecting calcium [[alginate]] in a sub-periosteal location.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Stevens |first1=Molly M. |last2=Marini |first2=Robert P. |last3=Schaefer |first3=Dirk |last4=Aronson |first4=Joshua |last5=Langer |first5=Robert |last6=Shastri |first6=V.

This membrane contains an endogenous population of pluripotent cells called the periosteal cells, which are a type of [[mesenchymal stem cells]] (MSC), which reside in the [[cambium]] layer, i.e., the side facing the bone. A key step in the procedure is the elevation of the periosteum without damaging the cambium surface and to ensure this a new technique called hydraulic elevation was developed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Marini |first1=Robert P. |last2=Stevens |first2=Molly M. |last3=Langer |first3=Robert |last4=Shastri |first4=V. Prasad |title=Hydraulic Elevation of the Periosteum: A Novel Technique for Periosteal Harvest |journal=Journal of Investigative Surgery |year=2004 |volume=17 |issue=4 |pages=229–233 |doi=10.1080/08941930490472073 |url=http://informahealthcare.com/doi/abs/10.1080/08941930490472073 |accessdate=19 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The choice of the sub-periosteum site is used because stimulation of the cambium layer using transforming growth factor–beta resulted in enhanced [[chondrogenesis]], i.e., formation of [[cartilage]]. In development the formation of bone can either occur via a Cartilage template initially formed by the MSCs that then gets ossified through a process called [[endochondral ossification]] or directly from MSC [[Cellular differentiation|differentiation]] to bone via a process termed ''[[Intramembranous ossification|intra-membranous ossification]]''.  Upon exposure of the periosteal cells to calcium from the alginate gel, these cells become bone cells and start producing bone matrix through the intra-membranous ossification process, recapitulating all steps of bone matrix deposition.  The extension of the IVB paradigm to engineering autologous [[hyaline]] cartilage was also recently demonstrated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Emans |first1=Pieter J. |author2=Lodewijk W. van Rhijn |author3=Welting, Tim J. M. |author4=Cremers, Andy |author5=Wijnands, Nina |author6=Spaapen, Frank |author7=J. Voncken, Willem |author8=Shastri, V. Prasad |title=Autologous engineering of cartilage |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, USA |date=January 7, 2010 |volume=107 |issue=8 |pages=3418–3423 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0907774107 |url=http://www.pnas.org/content/107/8/3418.abstract |accessdate=19 February 2014|pmc=2840469 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In this case, [[agarose]] is injected and this triggers local [[Agarose|hypoxia]], which then results in the differentiation of the periosteal MSCs into articular chondrocytes, i.e. cells similar to those found in the joint cartilage. Since this processes occurs in a relative short period of less than two weeks and cartilage can remodel into bone, this approach might provide some advantages in treatment of both cartilage and bone loss. The IVB concept needs to be however realized in humans and this is currently being undertaken.

==Protocol==
Every message received by an Insteon compatible device undergoes error detection and correction and is then retransmitted to improve reliability. All devices retransmit the same message simultaneously so that message transmissions are synchronous to the powerline frequency, thus preserving the integrity of the message while strengthening the signal on the powerline and erasing RF dead zones. Insteon powerline messaging uses [[phase-shift keying]]. Insteon RF messaging uses [[frequency-shift keying]].

Each message contains a two-bit "[[hop (networking)|hops]]" field that is initialized to 3 by the originating node and decremented each time a node in the network repeats the message. Individual Insteon messages can also carry up to 14 [[byte]]s of arbitrary user data for custom applications.

==Network topology==
Insteon is an integrated dual-mesh (formerly referred to as "dual-band") network that combines wireless [[radio frequency]] (RF) and a building's existing electrical wiring. The electrical wiring becomes a backup transmission medium in the event of RF/wireless [[Interference (communication)|interference]]. Conversely, RF/wireless becomes a backup transmission medium in the event of powerline interference. As a [[peer-to-peer]] network, devices do not require network supervision, thus allowing optional operation without central controllers and [[routing table]]s.

Insteon devices can function without a central controller.  Additionally, they may be managed by a central controller to implement functions such as control via smartphones and tablets, control scheduling, event handling, and problem reporting via email or text messaging. A computer can be used as a central controller by connecting it to an Insteon USB/[[serial port|serial]] PowerLinc modem, which serves as a communication bridge between the computer and the Insteon device network.

==Security==
Insteon network security is maintained via ''linking control'' to ensure that users cannot create links that would allow them to control a neighbors’ Insteon devices, and via encryption within extended Insteon messages for applications such as door locks and security applications, should those applications choose to implement encryption.&lt;ref name=details&gt;{{cite web | url= http://cache.insteon.com/documentation/insteon_details.pdf | title= Insteon The Details | date= 2013 | format= PDF | publisher= Insteon}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|53}}

Insteon enforces linking control by requiring users to have physical possession of devices, or knowledge of their unique Insteon IDs in order to create links. Firmware in Insteon devices prohibits them from identifying themselves to other devices unless a user either physically presses a button on the device during the installation process or explicitly addresses the device via a central controller. Linking to a device by sending Insteon messages (e.g., from a central controller) requires knowledge of the address of the target Insteon device. As these addresses are unique for each device and assigned at the factory (and displayed on a printed label attached to each device), users must have physical access to the device to read the device address from the label and manually enter it when prompted during installation.

The security of Insteon RF devices was criticized in a [[DEF CON]] presentation in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Shipley|first1=Peter|title=Insteon: False Security and Deceptive Documentation|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dy1LTQLmPtM|website=Youtube|accessdate=18 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Installation==
Insteon devices are configured by applying a sequence of "taps" (button presses) to a pushbutton on each device to establish direct device-to-device links. Alternatively, a central controller may be used to configure devices.

Each Insteon device has its own unique identifier code, similar to a [[MAC address]], and the technology allows directly linked devices to manage their identifiers.

==Compatibility==
Older Insteon chip sets manufactured by Smartlabs can transmit, receive, and respond to (but not repeat) [[X10 (industry standard)|X10]] power line messages, thus enabling X10 networks to interoperate with Insteon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=X10 Programming for Insteon Devices|url=http://www.smarthome.com/insteon-x10-programming.html|website=Smarthome|publisher=Smarthome Inc.|accessdate=15 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Home Control 101: Insteon vs. X10|url=http://www.electronichouse.com/daily/smart-home/home-control-101-insteon-vs-x10/|website=EH Network|publisher=EH Publishing|accessdate=15 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, Insteon released a home automation system compatible with the touch-enabled [[Metro (design language)|Metro interface]], with devices appearing as [[Windows Phone 8.1#Live tiles|"live tiles"]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hachman|first1=Mark|title=Microsoft teams with Insteon to sell connected-home kits|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/2155343/microsoft-teams-with-insteon-to-sell-connected-home-kits.html|website=pcworld.com|publisher=IDG Consumer &amp; SMB|accessdate=29 December 2014|date=15 May 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141221221550/http://www.pcworld.com/article/2155343/microsoft-teams-with-insteon-to-sell-connected-home-kits.html|archivedate=21 December 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later added voice control via [[Cortana (software)|Microsoft Cortana]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ochs|first1=Susie|title=Insteon's Cortana integration will let Windows Phone users talk to their house|url=http://www.techhive.com/article/2454273/insteons-cortana-integration-will-let-windows-phone-users-talk-to-their-house.html|website=techhive.com|publisher=IDG Consumer &amp; SMB|accessdate=29 December 2014|date=16 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Darryl Taft, [http://www.eweek.com/mobile/insteon-taps-microsoft-cortana-for-windows-phone-8.1-home-automation-app.html#sthash.xCMnyVzM.dpuf "Insteon Taps Microsoft Cortana for Windows Phone 8.1 Home Automation App"], ''eWeek'', July 16, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:JP Seeburg B-2 Intervalometer.jpg|thumb|J.P. Seeburg B-2 Intervalometer]]

An '''intervalometer''' is a [[Machine|device]] that counts intervals of [[time]]. Such devices are commonly used to signal, in accurate time intervals, the operation of some other device. For instance, an intervalometer might activate something every 30 [[second]]s. Other names for such a device include '''interval meter''' and '''interval timer'''.

==Photography==
[[File:A-26 Invader City of Santa Rosa intervalometer.JPG|thumb|An intervalometer for a reconnaissance camera on a [[Douglas A-26 Invader]] aircraft]]
{{see also|Long-exposure photography|Time-lapse photography|Multiple exposure}}

In [[photography]], intervalometers are used to trigger [[exposure (photography)|exposure]]s. This is often done for a [[time-lapse]] series. It may also be used to take, or begin taking, picture(s) after a set delay.

Examples of intervalometer use in [[aerial photography]] include delaying the start of picture taking by an unattended camera until some time after takeoff and separating multiple exposures in time, and thus distance as the vehicle containing the camera travels, to obtain the 3D effect ([[stereoscopy]]). To obtain the 3D effect each image should have about 60% of the surface in common with either the preceding or following image. The interval is calculated as a function of the altitude and speed of the vehicle; shorter intervals for low altitude and high speed.

Often the purpose of a photographic intervalometer is to reduce the resources required either to take the pictures or post-process them as similar images could be obtained by having the camera continuously take pictures as rapidly as possible.  Using an intervalometer permits restricting the pictures taken to only those with the desired content.  This reduces the requirements for resources such as power and storage media (e.g. film or memory card space).

Most [[digital single-lens reflex]] (DSLR) cameras are limited to 30 second or shorter exposures. An intervalometer can be used to take long (&gt;30 seconds) or very [[long-exposure photography|long exposures]] (minutes or hours) using the "[[Bulb (photography)|Bulb]]" setting. Long and very long exposures taken at night can be combined to create time-lapse animations, including [[star trail]]s. [[astrophotography|Astrophotographers]] can use processing techniques with such exposures to create images of [[deep-sky object]]s in the [[night sky]], like [[nebulae]] and [[galaxies]].

Most modern cameras include the most basic intervalometer functionality, the "self-timer". This delays the shutter release for a short time, allowing the photographer to get into the picture, for example.

In the past, intervalometers were external devices which interfaced to a camera to trigger taking a picture, or series of pictures, at a set time.  These sometimes used existing [[shutter (photography)|remote shutter]] features on cameras.  Later, standalone products commonly referred to as intervalometers have added capabilities far beyond the basics of just measuring, and signaling, a time interval.  One of the first features that was added to intervalometers was the ability to use an external event to signal the start of the time interval(s).  The ability to sense an external event is such a common feature of intervalometer products that many people do not distinguish between the sensing of the event and the measuring of time intervals.

What is meant when someone refers to an "intervalometer" must be determined from context.  Some possibilities are: time-lapse capability (strictly an intervalometer function), sensing of a remote event, a time delay longer than what most consider the "self-timer" range, etc.  Strictly speaking, an intervalometer only measures, and/or signals, time intervals.

Almost all digital cameras have the basic hardware capability required for intervalometer functions: knowing the current and elapsed times.  The implementation of more advanced functions is a matter of what the manufacturer chooses to implement in the camera's firmware.  Functions beyond the self-timer are beginning to be seen in some digital cameras, and are used in some cases to distinguish models within a camera line.

==Military application==
The ALE-39 [[countermeasures]] system uses intervalometers manufactured by Ledex Inc. (now part of [[Johnson Electric]]) of Dayton, Ohio.  The ALE-39 can fire [[Flare (countermeasure)|flare]]s in a synchronized pattern, very rapidly and with great reliability. The intervalometer used in the ALE-39 is essentially a [[solenoid]]-actuated [[rotary switch]] driven by a separate programmer which gives timing intervals and channel enabling to either of one or two channels. Intervalometers that contain internal interval clocks include the Lau-68, Suu-13 and similar electromechanically sequenced switches. Safety is provided to unfired outputs by maintaining a ground connection to all except the output being selected for firing; i.e., providing an electrical pulse to the firing squib.

[[Bomber aircraft]] can release all of their bombs at one time ("salvo") or drop individual bombs at intervals. If the bombardier selects the latter, he can program an intervalometer to control the pace at which the bombs are released. This, of course, determines how far apart they will land in the target area.

==Home==
One of the more common types of intervalometers is the timer that is used to turn lights on and off at set times, or that of an [[automatic sprinkler]] system.  These are commonly used by people when they leave their home for an extended period of time to make it appear the home is occupied.  There are also a large number of commercial and industrial applications for even such basic intervalometers.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13545">&lt;!-- [File:Keele valley dump power plant and main station.jpg|right|thumb|A power station run on landfill gas.]]--&gt;
'''Landfill gas''' is a complex mix of different gases created by the action of [[microorganism]]s within a [[landfill]].  Landfill gas is approximately forty to sixty percent [[methane]], with the remainder being mostly [[carbon dioxide]].  Trace amounts of other volatile organic compounds (VOCs) comprise the remainder (&lt;1%).  These trace gases include a large array of species, mainly simple [[hydrocarbon]]s.&lt;ref name=Ullmann&gt;Hans-Jürgen Ehrig, Hans-Joachim Schneider and Volkmar Gossow "Waste, 7. Deposition" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, 2011, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. {{DOI|10.1002/14356007.o28_o07}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Landfill gases have an influence on [[climate change]]. The major components are [[CO2|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] and [[methane]], both of which are [[greenhouse gas]]. Methane in the atmosphere is a far more potent [[greenhouse gas]], with each molecule having twenty five times the effect of a molecule of carbon dioxide. Methane itself however accounts for less composition of the atmosphere than does carbon dioxide ..  Landfills are the third largest source of methane in the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www3.epa.gov/climatechange/ghgemissions/gases/ch4.html|title=Methane Emissions|publisher=Environmental Protection Agency|accessdate=13 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production==
Landfill gases are the result of three processes:&lt;ref name=Ullmann/&gt;
*evaporation of volatile organic compounds (e.g., solvents)
*[[chemical reaction]]s between waste components
*[[microbe|microbial action]], especially [[methanogenesis]]. 
The first two depend strongly on the nature of the waste.  The dominant process in most landfills is the third process whereby [[Anaerobic organism|anaerobic bacteria]] decompose organic waste to produce biogas, which consists of methane and carbon dioxide together with traces of other compounds.&lt;ref name="EIA Landfill Gas"&gt;{{cite web|title = Landfill Gas and Biogas|publisher = U.S. Energy Information Administration|url = http://www.eia.gov/Energyexplained/?page=biomass_biogas|accessdate = 2015-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite the heterogeneity of waste, the evolution of gases follows well defined [[chemical kinetics|kinetic pattern]].  Formation of methane and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; commences about six months after depositing the landfill material.  The evolution of gas reaches a maximum at about 20 years, then declines over the course of decades.&lt;ref name=Ullmann/&gt;

==Monitoring==
{{Main article|Landfill gas monitoring}}
Because gases produced by landfills are both valuable and sometimes hazardous, monitoring techniques have been developed. Flame ionization detectors can be used to measure methane levels as well as total VOC levels. Surface monitoring and sub-surface monitoring as well as monitoring of the ambient air is carried out.  In the U.S., under the Clean Air Act of 1990, it is required that many large landfills install gas collection and control systems, which means that at the very least the facilities must collect and [[gas flare|flare the gas]].

U.S. Federal regulations under Subtitle D of RCRA formed in October 1979 regulate the siting, design, construction, operation, monitoring, and closure of MSW landfills. Subtitle D now requires controls on the migration of methane in landfill gas. Monitoring requirements must be met at landfills during their operation, and for an additional 30 years after. The landfills affected by Subtitle D of RCRA are required to control gas by establishing a way to check for [[methane emissions]] periodically and therefore prevent off-site migration. Landfill owners and operators must make sure the concentration of methane gas does not exceed 25% of the LEL for methane in the facilities' structures and the LEL for methane at the facility boundary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Landfill Gas Control Measures|publisher=Agency for Toxic Substances &amp; Disease Registry|url=http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/hac/landfill/html/ch5.html|accessdate=2010-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A United States [[Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) report indicates that as of 2016, counts of operational municipal solid waste landfills range between 1,900 and 2,000. In a nation-wide study done by the Environmental Research and Education Foundation in 2013, only 1,540 operational municipal solid waste landfills were counted throughout the United States. Decomposing waste in these landfills produce landfill gas, which is a mixture of about half methane and half carbon dioxide. Landfills are the third largest source of methane emissions in the United States, with municipal solid waste landfills representing 95 percent of this fraction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.epa.gov/lmop/basic-information-about-landfill-gas|title=Basic Information about Landfill Gas - US EPA|first=US|last=EPA,OAR,OAP,CCD|date=|website=US EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2017-02/documents/2017_complete_report.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}

The gases produced within a landfill can be collected and used in various ways. The landfill gas can be utilized directly on site by a boiler or any type of combustion system, providing heat. Electricity can also be generated on site through the use of microturbines, steam turbines, or fuel cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sullivan|first=Patrick|title=The Importance of Landfill Gas Capture and Utilization in the U.S|url=http://www.scsengineers.com/Papers/Sullivan_Importance_of_LFG_Capture_and_Utilization_in_the_US.pdf|publisher=SUR|accessdate=27 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The landfill gas can also be sold off site and sent into natural gas pipelines. This approach requires the gas to be processed into pipeline quality, e.g., by removing various contaminants and components.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Landfill Gas Power Plants|url=http://www.energy.ca.gov/biomass/landfill_gas.html|publisher=California Energy Commission|accessdate=27 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The efficiency of gas collection at landfills directly impacts the amount of energy that can be recovered - closed landfills (those no longer accepting waste) collect gas more efficiently than open landfills (those that are still accepting waste). A comparison of collection efficiency at closed and open landfills found about a 17 percentage point difference between the two.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Estimates of solid waste disposal rates and reduction targets for landfill gas emissions|url = http://www.nature.com/nclimate/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nclimate2804.html|journal = Nature Climate Change|date = 2015-09-21|issn = 1758-6798|volume = advance online publication|doi = 10.1038/nclimate2804|language = en|first = Jon T.|last = Powell|first2 = Timothy G.|last2 = Townsend|first3 = Julie B.|last3 = Zimmerman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Landfill gas can also be used to evaporate leachate, another byproduct of the landfill process. This application displaces another fuel that was previously used for the same thing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Landfill Methane Outreach program|url=http://www.epa.gov/lmop/basic-info/index.html|publisher=EPA|accessdate=27 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the U.S., the number of landfill gas projects increased from 399 in 2005, to 594 in 2012&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Landfill Gas to Energy|publisher=EPA|url=http://www.biosphereplastic.com/landfill-gas-to-energy/methane-to-energy/|accessdate=2012-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; according to the [[Environmental Protection Agency]]. These projects are popular because they control energy costs and reduce [[greenhouse gas]] emissions. These projects collect the methane gas and treat it, so it can be used for electricity or upgraded to pipeline-grade gas. (Methane gas has twenty-one times the [[global warming potential]] of carbon dioxide).&lt;ref name="Koch"&gt;{{cite news|title=Landfill Projects on the rise|publisher=USA Today|url=https://www.usatoday.com/money/industries/energy/2010-02-24-landfill-energy_N.htm|accessdate=2010-04-25 | first=Wendy | last=Koch | date=2010-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in the U.S., [[Waste Management, Inc|Waste Management]] uses landfill gas as an energy source at 110 landfill gas-to-energy facilities. This energy production offsets almost two million tons of coal per year, creating energy equivalent to that needed by four hundred thousand homes. These projects also reduce greenhouse gas emissions into the atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thinkgreen.com/landfill-gas-to-energy|title=Landfill Gas to Energy|publisher=Waste Management|accessdate=2010-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The EPA, which estimates that hundreds of landfills could support gas to energy projects, has also established the Landfill Methane Outreach Program. This program was developed to reduce methane emissions from landfills in a cost-effective manner by encouraging the development of environmentally and economically beneficial landfill gas-to-energy projects.&lt;ref name="Landfill Gas"&gt;{{cite web|title = Landfill Gas|publisher = Gas Separation Technology LLC|url = http://www.gassep.com/lfg.htm|accessdate = 2010-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Opposition===
Capture and use of landfill gas can be expensive. Some environmental groups claim that the projects do not produce "renewable power" because trash (their source) is not renewable. The [[Sierra Club]] opposes government subsidies for such projects.&lt;ref name="Koch"/&gt;  The [[Natural Resources Defense Council]] (NRDC) argues that government incentives should be directed more towards solar, wind, and energy-efficiency efforts.

==Microbial oxidation==
When landfill gas permeates through a soil cover, a fraction of the [[methane]] in the gas is oxidized microbially to [[CO2|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]].&lt;ref&gt;Scheutz, C., Kjeldsen, P., Bogner, J.E., De Visscher, A., Gebert, J., Hilger, H.A. &amp; Spokas, K. (2009) Microbial methane oxidation processes and technologies for mitigation of landfill gas emissions. Waste Manage. Res. 27:409-455.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Safety==
Landfill gas emissions can lead to [[Natural environment|environmental]], [[hygiene]] and [[security]] problems in the landfill.&lt;ref&gt;Brosseau, J. (1994) Trace gas compound emissions from municipal landfill sanitary sites; Atmospheric-Environment 28 (2), 285-293&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Christensen, T. H., Cossu, R. &amp; Stegmann, R. (1999) Landfilling of waste: Biogas&lt;/ref&gt; Several accidents have occurred, for example at [[Loscoe]], England in 1986,&lt;ref&gt;Williams and Aitkenhead (1991) Lessons from Loscoe: The uncontrolled migration of landfill gas; The Quarterly Journal of Engineering Geology 24 (2), 191-207&lt;/ref&gt; where migrating landfill gas accumulated and partially destroyed a property. An accident causing two deaths occurred from an explosion in a house adjacent to Skellingsted landfill in Denmark in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.mst.dk/common/Udgivramme/Frame.asp?pg=http://www2.mst.dk/Udgiv/publikationer/2001/87-7944-831-3/html/kap30.htm|title=Danish EPA|author=|date=|website=mst.dk}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the risk presented by landfill gas, there is a clear need to monitor gas produced by landfills. In addition to the risk of fire and explosion, gas migration in the subsurface can result in contact of landfill gas with [[groundwater]]. This, in turn, can result in contamination of groundwater by organic compounds present in nearly all landfill gas.&lt;ref&gt;Kerfoot, H.B., Chapter 3.5 In Christensen, T. H., Cossu, R. &amp; Stegmann, R. (1999)Landfilling of waste: Biogas&lt;/ref&gt;

Although usually evolved only in trace amounts, landfills do release some [[aromatic hydrocarbon|aromatics]] and [[chlorocarbon]]s.

[[Landfill gas migration]], due to pressure differentials and diffusion, can occur. This can create an explosion hazard if the gas reaches sufficiently high concentrations in adjacent buildings.

[[Image:Homemade lip balm.jpg|thumb|Homemade lip balms]]
'''Lip balm''' or '''lip salve''' is a [[wax]]-like substance applied topically to the lips of the [[mouth]] to moisturize and relieve [[Chapped lips|chapped]] or dry lips, [[angular cheilitis]], [[stomatitis]], or [[Herpes labialis|cold sores]]. Lip balm often contains  [[beeswax]] or [[carnauba wax]], [[camphor]], [[cetyl alcohol]], [[lanolin]], [[Paraffin wax|paraffin]], and [[Petroleum jelly|petrolatum]], among other ingredients. Some varieties contain dyes, flavor, fragrance, [[phenol]], [[salicylic acid]], and [[sunscreen]]s.

The primary purpose of lip balm is to provide an occlusive layer on the lip surface to seal moisture in lips and protect them from external exposure. Dry air, cold temperatures, and wind all have a drying effect on skin by drawing moisture away from the body. Lips are particularly vulnerable because the skin is so thin, and thus they are often the first to present signs of dryness. Occlusive materials like waxes and [[petroleum jelly]] prevent moisture loss and maintain lip comfort while flavorants, colorants, sunscreens, and various medicaments can provide additional, specific benefits.

Lip balm can be applied where a finger is used to apply it to the lips, or in a [[lipstick]]-style tube from which it can be applied directly.

Lip balm was first marketed in the 1880s by [[Charles Browne Fleet]],&lt;ref name="history"&gt;{{cite web | title=The History of Chapstick - The History of Carmex | publisher=About.com | url=http://inventors.about.com/od/cstartinventions/a/chapstick.htm | accessdate=2010-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source?|date=August 2010}} though its origins may be traced to [[earwax]].&lt;ref name="wax"&gt;{{cite journal |journal= [[European Journal of Clinical Microbiology &amp; Infectious Diseases]] |volume= 30 |issue= 8  |year= 2011 |pages= 997–1004 |doi= 10.1007/s10096-011-1185-2 |pmid= 21298458 |last1= Schwaab |first1= M |last2= Gurr |first2= A |last3= Neumann |first3= A |last4= Dazert |first4= S |last5= Minovi |first5= A |title= Human antimicrobial proteins in ear wax}}&lt;/ref&gt; More than 40 years prior to the commercial introduction of lip balm by [[Charles Browne Fleet|Fleet]], [[Lydia Maria Child]] recommended earwax as a treatment for cracked lips in her highly-popular book, {{cite book |title=The American Frugal Housewife}}  [[Lydia Maria Child|Child]] observed that, "Those who are troubled with cracked lips have found this earwax remedy successful when others have failed. It is one of those sorts of cures, which are very likely to be laughed at; but I know of its having produced very beneficial results."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Lydia Maria Francis Child|title=The American Frugal Housewife|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=D3AEAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA116#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|year=1833|publisher=S.S. &amp; W.

== Dependency ==
Some physicians have suggested that certain types of lip balm can be addictive or contain ingredients that actually cause drying.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/video/watch/?id=3606001n|title=Avoiding Lip Balm Addiction|publisher=[[CBS]]|accessdate=1 October 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110126012707/http://www.cbsnews.com/video/watch/?id=3606001n|archive-date=26 January 2011|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lip balm manufacturers sometimes state in their FAQs that there is nothing addictive in their products or that all ingredients are listed and approved by the FDA. [[Snopes]] found the claim that there are substances in [[Carmex]] that are irritants necessitating reapplication, such as ground glass, to be false.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.snopes.com/business/secret/carmex.asp Lip Balm entry] on [[snopes]].com&lt;/ref&gt;

As of February 2016, 72 [[Global Positioning System]] [[navigation satellites]] have been launched, 31 of which are operational, 9 in reserve, 30 have been retired and 2 were lost at launch.  The constellation requires a minimum of 24 operational satellites, and the official target count is 33.&lt;ref name="GPS.gov advice"&gt;{{cite web|last1=US Government|title=GPS.gov|url=http://www.gps.gov/support/faq/#gap1|website=GPS.gov|publisher=US Govt.|accessdate=21 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

SVNs are "space vehicle numbers" which are serial numbers assigned to each GPS satellite. PRNs are the "pseudo-random noise" sequences, or [[Gold code]]s, that each satellite transmits to differentiate itself from other satellites in the active constellation.

Numbers in parentheses refer to non-operational satellites.

Once launched, GPS satellites do not change their plane assignment but slot assignments are somewhat arbitrary and are subject to change.

=== Cross reference of PRNs to satellite blocks ===
The following table is for the purpose of making it possible to determine the block associated with a PRN by looking at one column in one table rather than having to search through all rows of three tables.  Thus this table can be used to quickly and easily determine the number of satellites in orbit and health associated with each block.

=== PRN to SVN history ===
This section is for the purpose of making it possible to determine the PRN associated with a SVN at a particular epoch. For example, SVN 049 had been assigned PRNs 01, 24, 27, and 30 at different times of its lifespan, whereas PRN 01 had been assigned to SVNs 032, 037, 049, 035, and 063 at different epochs. This information can be found in the [http://www.igs.org IGS] [https://web.archive.org/web/20131013225217/http://igscb.jpl.nasa.gov/igscb/station/general/antex14.txt ANTEX] [ftp://igs.org/pub/station/general/igs08.atx file], which uses the convention "GNN" and "GNNN" for PRNs and SVNs, respectively. For example, SVN 049 is described as:
&lt;pre&gt;BLOCK IIR-M         G01                 G049      2009-014A TYPE / SERIAL NO

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7931">{{short description|one of a finite number of states that a digital signal can inhabit}}
In [[digital circuit]]s, a '''logic level''' is one of a finite number of [[State (computer science)|states]] that a [[Digital signal (electronics)|digital signal]] can inhabit. Logic levels are usually represented by the [[voltage]] difference between the signal and [[Ground (electricity)|ground]], although other standards exist. The range of voltage levels that represents each state depends on the [[logic family]] being used.

==2-level logic==
In binary logic the two levels are '''logical high''' and '''logical low''', which generally correspond to [[binary number]]s 1 and 0 respectively. Signals with one of these two levels can be used in [[boolean algebra]] for digital circuit design or analysis.

===Active state===
The use of either the higher or the lower voltage level to represent either logic state is arbitrary. The two options are '''active high''' and '''active low'''. Active-high and active-low states can be mixed at will: for example, a [[read only memory]] integrated circuit may have a chip-select signal that is active-low, but the data and address bits are conventionally active-high. Occasionally a logic design is simplified by inverting the choice of active level (see [[De Morgan's theorem]]).

{|class="wikitable"

! Logic level
! Active-high signal
! Active-low signal
|-
| Logical high

|-
| Logical low

| 1
|}

The name of an active-low signal is historically written with a bar above it to distinguish it from an active-high signal.  For example, the name &lt;span style=text-decoration:overline&gt;Q&lt;/span&gt;, read "Q bar" or "Q not", represents an active-low signal.  The conventions commonly used are:
* a bar above ({{overline|Q}})
* a leading slash (/Q)
* a lower-case n prefix or suffix (nQ or Q_n)
* a trailing [[Number sign|#]] (Q#), or
* an "_B" or "_L" suffix (Q_B or Q_L).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://wiki.electroniciens.cnrs.fr/images/Xilinx_HDL_Coding_style.pdf |title=Coding Style Guidelines |publisher=[[Xilinx]] |access-date=2017-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many control signals in electronics are active-low signals &lt;ref name='Complete digital design'&gt;{{cite book | last = Balch | first = Mark | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Complete Digital Design: A Comprehensive Guide To Digital Electronics And Computer System Architecture | publisher = McGraw-Hill Professional | year = 2003 | location = | pages = 430 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=uFSRT-OIxyoC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_v2_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false | doi = | id = | isbn = 978-0-07-140927-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (usually reset lines, chip-select lines and so on). Logic families such as [[Transistor-transistor logic|TTL]] can sink more current than they can source, so [[fanout]] and [[noise immunity]] increase.  It also allows for [[wired-OR]] logic if the logic gates are [[open-collector]]/[[open-drain]] with a pull-up resistor.  Examples of this are the [[I²C]] bus and the [[Controller Area Network]] (CAN),and the [[Conventional PCI|PCI Local Bus]]. [[RS232]] signaling, as used on some [[serial port]]s, uses active-low signals.

Some signals have a meaning in both states and notation may indicate such.  For example, it is common to have a read/write line designated R/&lt;span style=text-decoration:overline&gt;W&lt;/span&gt;, indicating that the signal is high in case of a read and low in case of a write.

===Logic voltage levels===
The two logical states are usually represented by two different voltages, but two different [[Electric current|currents]] are used in some logic families. High and low thresholds are specified for each logic family. When below the low threshold, the signal is "low". When above the high threshold, the signal is "high". Intermediate levels are undefined, resulting in highly implementation-specific circuit behavior.

It is usual to allow some tolerance in the voltage levels used; for example, 0 to 2 volts might represent logic 0, and 3 to 5 volts logic 1.  A voltage of 2 to 3 volts would be invalid and occur only in a fault condition or during a logic level transition.  However, few logic circuits can detect such a condition, and most devices will interpret the signal simply as high or low in an undefined or device-specific manner.  Some logic devices incorporate [[Schmitt trigger]] inputs, whose behavior is much better defined in the threshold region and have increased resilience to small variations in the input voltage. The problem of the circuit designer is to avoid circumstances that produce intermediate levels, so that the circuit behaves predictably.

Nearly all digital circuits use a consistent logic level for all internal signals. That level, however, varies from one system to another. Interconnecting any two logic families often required special techniques such as additional [[pull-up resistor]]s or purpose-built interface circuits known as level shifters. A [[level shifter]] connects one digital circuit that uses one logic level to another digital circuit that uses another logic level. Often two level shifters are used, one at each system: A [[line driver]] converts from internal logic levels to standard interface line levels; a line receiver converts from interface levels to internal voltage levels.

For example, [[Transistor–transistor logic|TTL]] levels are different from those of [[CMOS]]. Generally a TTL output does not rise high enough to be reliably recognized as a logic 1 by a CMOS input, especially if it is only connected to a high-input-impedance CMOS input that does not source significant current. This problem was solved by the invention of the 74HCT family of devices that uses CMOS technology but TTL input logic levels. These devices only work with a 5&amp;nbsp;V power supply.

==3-level logic==
{{main article|Three-state logic}}

In [[three-state logic]], an output device can be in one of three possible states: 0, 1, or Z, with the last meaning [[high impedance]]. This is not a logic level, but means that the output is not controlling the state of the connected circuit.

==4-level logic==
{{main article|Four valued logic}}

4-level logic adds a fourth state, X ("don't care"), meaning the value of the signal is unimportant and undefined.  It means that an input is undefined, or an output signal may be chosen for implementation convenience (see {{slink|Karnaugh map|Don't cares}}).

==9-level logic==

[[IEEE 1164]] defines 9 logic states for use in [[electronic design automation]]. The standard includes strong and weakly driven signals, high impedance and unknown and unitialized states.

'''Loongson''' ({{zh|s=龙芯|t=龍芯|first=s|p=Lóngxīn|l=Dragon Core}})&lt;ref&gt;[http://tech.sina.com.cn/it/2006-11-20/00141245061.shtml 龍芯處理器英文品牌定名Loongson]&lt;/ref&gt; is a family of general-purpose [[MIPS architecture|MIPS64]] [[central processing unit|CPU]]s developed at the ''Institute of Computing Technology'' (ICT), [[Chinese Academy of Sciences]] (CAS) in  [[China]].&lt;ref name="chinamoneynetwork"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Wu |first1=Yimian |title=China Supports Local Semiconductor Firms By Adding Them To Government Procurement List |url=https://www.chinamoneynetwork.com/2018/05/23/china-supports-local-semiconductor-firms-by-adding-them-to-government-procurement-list |accessdate=31 May 2018 |publisher=China Money Network |date=23 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The chief architect is Professor {{Interlanguage link multi|Hu Weiwu|zh|3=胡伟武}}. It was formerly called '''Godson'''.

Loongson is the result of a [[public–private partnership]]. ''BLX IC Design Corporation'' was founded in 2002 by ICT and Jiangsu Zhongyi Group. Based in [[Beijing]], BLX focuses on designing the [[64-bit]] Loongson general-purpose and [[embedded system|embedded]] processors, together with developing software tools and reference platforms.

[[STMicroelectronics]] fabricates and markets Loongson chips for BLX, which is [[Fabless manufacturing|fabless]].

==MIPS patent issues==
The current Loongson instruction set is a [[MIPS architecture|MIPS64]], but the internal [[microarchitecture]] is independently developed by [[Institute of Computing Technology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences|ICT]]. Early implementations of the family lacked four instructions patented by [[MIPS Technologies]] to avoid legal issues.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mdronline.com/mpr/h/2006/0626/202602.html China's Microprocessor Dilemma]{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.linleygroup.com/newsletters/newsletter_detail.php?num=4264&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, a deal was reached by MIPS Technologies and ICT. STMicroelectronics bought a MIPS license for Loongson, and thus the processor can be promoted as ''MIPS-based'' or ''MIPS-compatible'' instead of ''MIPS-like''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mips.com/news-events/newsroom/release-archive-2007/3_28_07.dot MIPS Technologies Licenses MIPS64 Architecture to STMicroelectronics] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130119122701/http://www.mips.com/news-events/newsroom/release-archive-2007/3_28_07.dot |date=19 January 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.st.com/stonline/stappl/cms/press/news/year2007/t2154.htm China’s Institute of Computing Technology and STMicroelectronics announce their cooperation on the Loongson processors] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201114754/http://www.st.com/stonline/stappl/cms/press/news/year2007/t2154.htm |date=1 December 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mdronline.com/mpr/h/2008/1103/224401.html Godson-3 Emulates x86]&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2009, ICT licensed the MIPS32 and MIPS64 architectures directly from ''MIPS Technologies''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mips.com/news-events/newsroom/?i=43093 China’s Institute of Computing Technology Licenses Industry-Standard MIPS Architectures] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120707163711/http://www.mips.com/news-events/newsroom/?i=43093 |date=7 July 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2011, Loongson Technology Corp. Ltd. licensed the MIPS32 and MIPS64 architectures from MIPS Technologies, Inc. for continued development of MIPS-based Loongson CPU cores.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mips.com/news-events/newsroom/newsindex/index.dot?id=42163 Loongson Licenses MIPS32® and MIPS64® Architectures for Embedded and Computing Applications] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130704115436/http://mips.com/news-events/newsroom/newsindex/index.dot?id=42163 |date=4 July 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=andnpz5dILv0&lt;/ref&gt;

The first revision of the Loongson architecture, the Loongson1 (Godson-232 core) is a pure [[32-bit]] CPU running at a clock speed of 266 [[MHz]]. It is fabricated with 0.18 micron CMOS process, has 8&amp;nbsp;KB of data cache, 8&amp;nbsp;KB of instruction cache and a 64-bit floating-point unit, capable of 200 double-precision MFLOPS.&lt;ref&gt;[http://uptime.christianlederer.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=1638&amp;sid=aa7742a330d67e84e163d3d4c1a1d8b4 cpu-museum.de Forum: Godson-1 and 2 Microprocessor Chips, 2005-Apr-20] {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is intended for embedded applications, such as [[point of sale]] (POS) systems, where a high performance 64-bit architecture is not needed.

===Loongson 2===
The Loongson 2 adds 64-bit ability to the Loongson architecture. Initially running at 500 [[MHz]], later revisions to Godson 2E were produced that run up to 1 [[GHz]]. The Godson 2F, released to market in early 2008, ran at 1.2 [[GHz]].

===Loongson 3===
The 65&amp;nbsp;nm Loongson 3 (Godson-3) is able to run at a clock speed near 1 [[GHz]], with [[Multi-core processor|4 CPU cores]] (~15 W) first and 8 cores later (40&amp;nbsp;W). In April 2010, Loongson 3A was released with DDR2/3 DRAM support. In 2017, Loongson released latest version of 3A cpu, 3A3000. As one of the domestic CPU of China, Loongson 3A3000 is being commercialized, and in the recently exhibition in Nanjing (2017), based on the Loongson 3A3000 motherboard developers computer quietly debut. 3A3000 is Loongson latest CPU model (2017), it is using a LoongISA instruction set and designed with quad-core 64-bit and clocked at 1.5&amp;nbsp;GHz, power consumption is only 30W. For the performance, because the frequency is only 1.5Ghz, 3A3000 single-threaded performance is significantly behind to intel or AMD products. 3A3000 is only about one-third of Intel i5 4460 (3.2G).

====Loongson 3B====

There are two versions of the Loongson-3B (Godson-3B), the first&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1st version: 32nm 6-core processor |url=http://www.loongson.cn/news_info.php?id=259 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140604053026/http://www.loongson.cn/news_info.php?id=259 |archivedate=4 June 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; featuring a 32&amp;nbsp;nm 6-core processor, and the second version&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2nd version: 28nm 8-core processor |url=http://www.loongson.cn/product_info.php?id=50 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140621110307/http://www.loongson.cn/product_info.php?id=50 |archivedate=21 June 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; having a 28&amp;nbsp;nm 8-core processor. Each version can be clocked from 1.2&amp;nbsp;GHz to 1.5&amp;nbsp;GHz. Loongson-3B has exceptional energy efficiency in terms of [[performance per watt]] - executing 192 GFLOPS using 40 watts. Each CPU core has 64&amp;nbsp;KB L1 cache and 128&amp;nbsp;KB L2 cache. All the cores share a common 8&amp;nbsp;MB L3 cache, which helps to reduce the cache miss rate.

ICT has launched a Loongson-3B-based six-core desktop solution.{{when|date=July 2018}} Technical specifications:
* [[Mini-ITX]] motherboard with Loongson-3B CPU
* [[AMD 700 chipset series#780E|ATI RS780E (AMD 780E)]] southbridge with 128&amp;nbsp;MB integrated graphics
* ATI SBx00 Azalia on-board audio
* up to 16 GB DDR3 memory
* Intel 82574L gigabit network interface
* PCI, PCIe, 4 SATA ports, USB and other peripheral interfaces
* Can optionally be equipped with [[Radeon HD 6000 Series#Radeon HD 6700|AMD HD6770]] discrete graphics, and HDD or SSD hard drive

This desktop solution uses an optimized version of Fedora 13, with a lot of software ported and available, such as [[Kingsoft Office|Kingsoft (WPS) office]] suite. The manufacturer states that the user experience of the desktop solution has been significantly improved over its Loongson-3A based predecessor. Results of a benchmark test, conducted in April 2014, are available&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Results of benchmark test of Loongson-3B six-core desktop solution|url=http://openbenchmarking.org/result/1404098-SO-3B1W2703307}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Hardware-assisted x86 emulation====
The Loongson 3 adds over 200 new instructions over Loongson 2. Their addition has the specific benefit of  speeding up Intel x86 CPU  emulation at a cost of 5% of the total [[die (integrated circuit)|die]] area. The new instructions help with emulation performance, for example [[QEMU]] (the only known example). The new instructions reduce the impact of executing x86/[[complex instruction set computer|CISC]]-style instructions in the MIPS pipeline. With added improvements in QEMU from ICT, Loongson-3 achieves an average of 70% the performance of executing native binaries when running x86 binaries from nine benchmarks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/MM.2009.30 |title=Godson-3: A Scalable Multicore RISC Processor with x86 Emulation |publisher=[[IEEE]] |accessdate=16 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Supported software==
Unlike processors from [[Intel Corporation|Intel]], [[Advanced Micro Devices]] or [[VIA Technologies]], Loongson does not directly support the [[x86 instruction set]]. The processor's main [[operating system]] is [[Linux]], while in theory any OS with MIPS support should also work. For example, [[Windows CE]] was ported to a Loongson-based system with minimal effort.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bbs.lemote.com/bbs/viewthread.php?tid=8970 福瓏電腦WinCE 5.0 圖片] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927233842/http://bbs.lemote.com/bbs/viewthread.php?tid=8970 |date=27 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, Lemote ported an [[Android (operating system)|Android]] distribution to the Loongson platform.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9165678/Company_puts_Android_on_laptop_with_China_backed_chips Company puts Android on laptop with China-backed chips]&lt;/ref&gt;

Many operating systems work on Loongson:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=linux-loongson/community (社区版龙芯Linux)|url=http://dev.lemote.com/code/linux-loongson-community|website=dev.lemote.com|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140725174038/http://dev.lemote.com/code/linux-loongson-community|archivedate=25 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Fulong-MiniPC.jpg|thumb|right|Lemote's Fulong MiniPC on top of a CD-ROM drive as reference]]

In March 2006, a [[euro|€]]100 Loongson II computer design called ''Longmeng'' (Dragon Dream) was announced by [[Lemote]].

In June 2006 at Computex'2006, YellowSheepRiver announced the ''Municator YSR-639'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.linuxfordevices.com/c/a/News/Chinese-150-Linux-miniPC-races-OLPC-to-market/|title=LinuxDevices article about the Municator|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060423143832/http://www.linuxdevices.com/news/NS6301677114.html|archivedate=23 April 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; a [[small form factor]] computer based on the 400&amp;nbsp;MHz Loongson 2.

===Loongson 3A laptop===
Loongson insiders&lt;ref&gt;[http://video.sina.com.cn/v/b/50914026-1831431393.html 2011 Godson and the open source community development forum (Shanghai Station) extend the campus of Shanghai University Loongson 3A Mini-ITX motherboards &amp; laptops introduced, configuration, spy photos]&lt;/ref&gt; revealed a new model based on the Loongson 3A quad-core [[laptop]] has been developed and is expected to launch in August 2011. With a similar design to the [[MacBook Pro]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sigma.me/2011/05/13/loongson-3a-laptop.html Loongson 3A Laptop Prototype Photos]&lt;/ref&gt; from [[Apple Inc.]], it will carry a [[Linux]] operating system by default.

In September 2011, Lemote announced the Yeeloong-8133 13.3" laptop featuring 900&amp;nbsp;MHz, quad-core Loongson-3A/2GQ CPU.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lemote.com/products/computer/yilong/312.html |title=Lemote Announced Yeeloong-8133 Laptop |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110915095048/http://www.lemote.com/products/computer/yilong/312.html |archivedate=15 September 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Supercomputers===
On 26 December 2007, China revealed its first Loongson based [[supercomputer]] with performance 1 [[tera-|tera]][[FLOPS]] of peak performance, and about 350 [[GFLOPS]] measured by [[LINPACK]] in [[Hefei]], designated as '''KD-50-I'''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://kd50.ustc.edu.cn/ KD-50-I Home page] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081029181958/http://kd50.ustc.edu.cn/ |date=29 October 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This supercomputer was designed by a joint team led by [[Chen Guoliang]] at the computer science technology department of the [[University of Science and Technology of China]] and ICT (the secondary contractor).  KD-50-I is the first Chinese built supercomputer to utilize domestic Chinese CPUs, with a total of more than 336 Loongson-2F CPUs, and nodes are interconnected by Ethernet.  The size of the computer was roughly equivalent to a household refrigerator and the cost was less than [[Renminbi|RMB]] 800,000 (approximately US$120,000, [[Euro|EUR]] 80,000).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnbeta.com/articles/47215.htm 中国“龙芯2F”国产万亿次高性能计算机研制成功]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 20 April 2010, [[University of Science &amp; Technology of China|USTC]] announced successful development of Loongson 3A based '''KD-60-1'''. The new supercomputer is a cluster of standard [[blade server]]s with a total of over 80 quad-core Loongson processors, providing theoretical peak performance of 1 TFLOPS and reduces power consumption by 56% compared to the KD-50-I system that has similar performance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.360doc.com/content/10/0421/16/180702_24179571.shtml 中国“龙芯3A”国产万亿次高性能计算机研制成功]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 26 December 2012, [[University of Science &amp; Technology of China|USTC]] announced successful development of Loongson 3B based '''KD-90-1'''. The new supercomputer is a cluster of standard [[blade server]]s with a total of over 10 octo-core Loongson processors, providing theoretical peak performance of 1 TFLOPS, and reduces power consumption by 62% compared to the KD-60 system that has similar performance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.360doc.com/content/12/1230/15/8509355_257162962.shtml 中国“龙芯3B”国产万亿次高性能计算机研制成功]&lt;/ref&gt;

Microneedles are microscopic applicators used to deliver [[Vaccine|vaccines]] or other drugs through  [[transdermal]] application. Microneedles are constructed through various methods usually involving [[Photolithography|photolithographic]] processes or micromolding.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kim YC, Park JH, Prausnitz MR | title = Microneedles for drug and vaccine delivery | journal = Advanced Drug Delivery Reviews | volume = 64 | issue = 14 | pages = 1547–68 | date = November 2012 | pmid = 22575858 | pmc = 3419303 | doi = 10.1016/j.addr.2012.04.005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These methods involve [[Etching (microfabrication)|etching]] microscopic structure into resin or silicon in order to cast microneedles. Microneedles are made from a variety of material ranging from [[silicon]], [[titanium]], [[stainless steel]], and [[Polymer|polymers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Park JH, Allen MG, Prausnitz MR | title = Biodegradable polymer microneedles: fabrication, mechanics and transdermal drug delivery | journal = Journal of Controlled Release | volume = 104 | issue = 1 | pages = 51–66 | date = May 2005 | pmid = 15866334 | doi = 10.1016/j.jconrel.2005.02.002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Some microneedles are made of a drug to be delivered to the body but are shaped into a needle so they will penetrate the skin. The microneedles range in size, shape, and function but are all used as an alternative to other delivery methods like the conventional [[hypodermic needle]] or other [[Injection (medicine)|injection]] apparatus. 

Microneedles are usually applied through small arrays. The arrays used are a collection of microneedles, ranging from only a few microneedles to several hundred, applied to an applicator sometimes a patch or other solid stamping device. The arrays are applied to the skin of patients and are given time to allow for the effective administration of drugs. Microneedles are an easier method for physicians as they require less training to apply and because they are not as hazardous as other needles, making the administration of drugs to patients safer and less painful while also avoiding some of the drawbacks of using other forms of [[drug delivery]], such as risk of infection, production of hazardous waster, or cost. 

== Background ==
Microneedles were first mentioned in a 1998 paper on [[Transdermal|transdermal drug delivery]] demonstrating that microneedles could penetrate human skin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Henry S, McAllister DV, Allen MG, Prausnitz MR | title = Microfabricated microneedles: a novel approach to transdermal drug delivery | journal = Journal of Pharmaceutical Sciences | volume = 87 | issue = 8 | pages = 922–5 | date = August 1998 | pmid = 9687334 | doi = 10.1021/js980042+ }}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent research into microneedle drug delivery has explored the medical and cosmetic applications of this technology through its design. This early paper sought to explore the possibility of using microneedles in the future for vaccination. Since then researchers have studied microneedle delivery of [[Insulin (medication)|insulin]], vaccines, anti-inflammatories, and other pharmaceuticals. In dermatology, microneedles are used for scarring treatment with skin rollers.    

The major goal of any microneedle design is to penetrate the outmost layer of the skin the [[stratum corneum]] (10-15μm).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;    

Research has shown that there is a limit on the type of drugs that can be delivered through microneedles. Only compounds with a relatively low molecular weight, like the common allergen nickel (130 [[Relative atomic mass|Da]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bos JD, Meinardi MM | title = The 500 Dalton rule for the skin penetration of chemical compounds and drugs | journal = Experimental Dermatology | volume = 9 | issue = 3 | pages = 165–9 | date = June 2000 | pmid = 10839713 | doi = 10.1034/j.1600-0625.2000.009003165.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;, can penetrate the skin. Compounds that weigh more than 500 Da cannot penetrate the skin.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Jeong HR, Lee HS, Choi IJ, Park JH | title = Considerations in the use of microneedles: pain, convenience, anxiety and safety | journal = Journal of Drug Targeting | volume = 25 | issue = 1 | pages = 29–40 | date = January 2017 | pmid = 27282644 | doi = 10.1080/1061186x.2016.1200589 }}&lt;/ref&gt;    

== Types of Microneedles ==

=== Solid ===
This type of array is designed as a two part system; the microneedle array is first applied to the skin to create microscopic wells just deep enough to penetrate the outermost layer of skin, and then the drug is applied via [[transdermal patch]]. Solid microneedles are already used by dermatologists in [[collagen induction therapy]], a method which uses repeated puncturing of the skin with microneedles. 

=== Hollow ===
Hollow microneedles are similar to solid microneedles in material. They contain reservoirs that deliver the drug directly into the site. Since the delivery of the drug is dependent on the flow rate of the microneedle, there is a possibility that this type of array could become clogged by excessive swelling or flawed design.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This design also increases the likelihood of buckling under the pressure of application, and therefore failing to deliver any drugs.  

=== Coated ===
Just like solid microneedles, coated microneedles are usually designed from polymers or metals. In this method the drug is applied directly to the microneedle array instead of being applied through other patches or applicators. Coated microneedles are often covered in other [[Surfactant|surfactants]] or thickening agents to assure that the drug is delivered properly.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Some of the chemicals used on coated microneedles are known irritants. While there is risk of local inflammation to the area where the array was, the array can be removed immediately with no harm to the patient.

=== Dissolvable ===
In a more recent adaptation of the microneedle design, dissolvable microneedles encapsulate the drug in a nontoxic polymer which dissolves once inside the skin.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This polymer would allow the drug to be delivered into the skin and could be broken down once inside the body. Pharmaceutical companies and researchers have begun to study and implement polymers such as [[Fibroin]], a silk-based protein that can be molded into structures like microneedles and dissolved once in the body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mottaghitalab F, Farokhi M, Shokrgozar MA, Atyabi F, Hosseinkhani H | title = Silk fibroin nanoparticle as a novel drug delivery system | journal = Journal of Controlled Release | volume = 206 | pages = 161–76 | date = May 2015 | pmid = 25797561 | doi = 10.1016/j.jconrel.2015.03.020 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Advantages ==
There are many advantages to the use of microneedles, the most prominent being the improved comfort of patients. [[Fear of needles|Needle phobia]] can affect both adults and children, and sometimes can lead to fainting. The benefit of microneedle arrays is that they reduce anxiety that patients have when confronted with a hypodermic needle. In addition to improving psychological and emotional comfort, microneedles have been shown to be substantially less painful than conventional injections.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Some studies recorded children's views on blood sampling with microneedle and found patients were more willing when prompted with a less painful procedure than traditional sampling with needles. Microneedles are beneficial to physicians as well since they produce less hazardous waste than needles and are generally easier to use. Microneedles are also less expensive than needles as they require less material and the material used is cheaper than the materials in hypodermic needles. 

Microneedles present a new opportunity for home and community based healthcare. One of the biggest drawbacks of traditional needles is the hazardous waste that they produce, making disposal a serious concern for doctors and hospitals. For patients who require regular administration of medication at home, disposal can become an environmental concern is needles are placed in the trash.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Microneedles would provide those who are limited in their ability to seek hospital care with the ability to safely administer drugs in the comfort of their homes. 

One of the benefits of microneedles are their lower rates of [[Microorganism|microbial]] invasion into delivery sites.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Traditional injection methods can leave puncture wounds for up to 48 hours post-treatment. This leaves a large window of opportunity for harmful bacteria to enter into the skin. Microneedles only damage the skin to a depth of 10-15μm making it difficult for bacteria to enter the bloodstream, and giving the body a smaller wound to repair.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Further research is required to determine the types of bacteria able to breach the shallow puncture site of microneedles. 

== Disadvantages ==
There are some concerns about how physicians can be sure that all of the drug or vaccine has entered the skin when microneedles are applied. Hollow and coated microneedles both possess the risk that the drug will not properly enter the skin and will not be effective. Both of these types of microneedles can leak&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rzhevskiy AS, Singh TR, Donnelly RF, Anissimov YG | title = Microneedles as the technique of drug delivery enhancement in diverse organs and tissues | journal = Journal of Controlled Release | volume = 270 | pages = 184–202 | date = January 2018 | pmid = 29203415 | doi = 10.1016/j.jconrel.2017.11.048 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; onto a person's skin either by damage of the microneedle or incorrect application by the physician. This is why it is essential that physicians are trained how to properly apply the arrays.  

Another concern is that incorrectly applied arrays could leave foreign material in the body. Although there is a lower risk of infection associated with microneedles, the arrays are more fragile than a typical hypodermic needle due to their small size and thus have a chance of breaking off and remaining in the skin. Some of the material used to construct the microneedles, such as titanium, cannot be absorbed by the body and any fragments of the needles would cause irritation.  

There is a limited amount of literature available on the subject of microneedle drug delivery as current research is still exploring how to make effective needles.

The platform has been recognized by the [https://sloan.org/ Alfred P. Sloan Foundation], [[Online Learning Consortium]] &amp; by [[U.S. News &amp; World Report|US News and World Report.]]

==History==
The “e-Poly” story began back in 2006, as the online learning wing of the then Polytechnic University. The department was initially designed for its on-campus students to blend and accelerate their time to degree completion by taking some courses online. The first program offered entirely online was the Cybersecurity master's degree. By 2009, e-Poly program offerings included 3 master’s degrees and 2 advanced certificates. In 2009, e-Poly was renamed NYU-ePoly, in recognition of the university’s affiliation with NYU. Following the School's name change in October, 2015, the department was renamed NYU Tandon Online.&lt;ref name = "NYU Tandon Online: A New Name in Digital Education"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://engineering.nyu.edu/news/2015/12/10/nyu-tandon-online-new-name-digital-education |title = NYU Tandon Online: A New Name in Digital Education |date = |website = | accessdate = December 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; As growth remains constant, today NYU Tandon Online offers over 65 online courses in diverse technology and management fields.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23836">'''Network functions virtualization''' (also '''network function virtualization''' or '''NFV''')&lt;ref&gt;http://www.etsi.org/technologies-clusters/technologies/nfv&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[network architecture]] concept that uses the technologies of IT [[virtualization]] to virtualize entire classes of [[network node]] functions into building blocks that may connect, or chain together, to create communication services.

NFV relies upon, but differs from, traditional server-[[virtualization]] techniques, such as those used in enterprise IT. A virtualized network function, or VNF, may consist of one or more [[virtual machines]] running different software and processes, on top of standard high-volume servers, switches and storage devices, or even [[cloud computing]] infrastructure, instead of having custom hardware appliances for each network function.

For example, a virtual [[session border controller]] could be deployed to protect a network without the typical cost and complexity of obtaining and installing physical network protection units. Other examples of NFV include virtualized [[Network Load Balancing|load balancers]], [[Firewall (computing)|firewalls]], [[Intrusion detection system|intrusion detection devices]] and [[WAN optimization|WAN accelerators]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Network Functions Virtualisation (NFV); Use  NFV is present and SDN is future.Cases|url=http://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_gs/NFV/001_099/001/01.01.01_60/gs_NFV001v010101p.pdf|accessdate=6 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Product development within the telecommunication industry has traditionally followed rigorous standards for stability, protocol adherence and quality, reflected by the use of the term [[carrier grade]] to designate equipment demonstrating this reliability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/insights/2013/03/how-low-cost-telecom-killed-five-9s-in-cloud-computing/ |title=How Low-Cost Telecom Killed Five 9s in Cloud Computing |publisher=wired.com |date= |accessdate=2016-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While this model worked well in the past, it inevitably led to long product cycles, a slow pace of development and reliance on proprietary or specific hardware, e.g., bespoke [[application-specific integrated circuit]]s (ASICs). The rise of significant competition in communication services from fast-moving organizations operating at large scale on the public Internet (such as [[Google Talk]], [[Skype]], [[Netflix]]) has spurred service providers to look for ways to disrupt the status quo.

==History==
In October 2012, a specification group, "Network Functions Virtualisation",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Network Functions Virtualisation |work= ISG web portal |url= http://portal.etsi.org/portal/server.pt/community/NFV/367 |accessdate= 20 June 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
published a [[white paper]]&lt;ref name="white"&gt;{{cite web |title=Network Functions Virtualisation— Introductory White Paper |publisher= ETSI |date= 22 October 2012 |url= http://portal.etsi.org/NFV/NFV_White_Paper.pdf |accessdate= 20 June 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; at a conference in [[Darmstadt, Germany]], on [[software-defined networking]] (SDN) and [[OpenFlow]].  The group, part of the [[European Telecommunications Standards Institute]] (ETSI), was made up of representatives from the telecommunication industry from Europe and beyond.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title= Tier 1 Carriers Tackle Telco SDN |date= 22 October 2012 |author= Ray Le Maistre |work= Light Reading |url= http://www.lightreading.com/software-defined-networking/tier-1-carriers-tackle-telco-sdn/240135217 |accessdate= 20 June 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Latest Agenda at SDN &amp; OpenFlow World Congress |publisher= Layer123.com |deadurl=yes |url= http://www.layer123.com/sdn-agenda/ |archivedate= October 14, 2012 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20121014053339/http://www.layer123.com/sdn-agenda/ |accessdate= 20 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the publication of the white paper, the group has produced several more in-depth materials, including a standard terminology definition&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mulligan|first=Ultan|title=ETSI Publishes First Specifications for Network Functions Virtualisation|url=http://www.etsi.org/news-events/news/700-2013-10-etsi-publishes-first-nfv-specifications|accessdate=5 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and use cases for NFV that act as references for vendors and operators considering to adopt Network Virtualization.

==Framework==
The NFV framework consists of three main components:&lt;ref&gt;Network-Functions Virtualization (NFV) Proofs of Concept; [http://www.etsi.org/technologies-clusters/technologies/nfv Framework], GS NFV-PER 002 v1.1.1 (2013-10),&lt;/ref&gt;
# Virtualized network functions (VNFs) are software implementations of network functions that can be deployed on a network functions virtualization infrastructure (NFVI).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.datapath.io/network-function-virtualization-nfv|title=What is Network Function Virtualization (NFV)|work=blog.datapath.io}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Network functions virtualization infrastructure (NFVI) is the totality of all hardware and software components that build the environment where VNFs are deployed. The NFV infrastructure can span several locations. The network providing connectivity between these locations is considered as part of the NFV infrastructure.
# Network functions virtualization management and [[Orchestration_(computing)|orchestration]] architectural framework (NFV-MANO Architectural Framework) is the collection of all functional blocks, data repositories used by these blocks, and reference points and interfaces through which these functional blocks exchange information for the purpose of managing and orchestrating NFVI and VNFs.

The building block for both the NFVI and the NFV-MANO is the NFV platform. In the NFVI role, it consists of both virtual and physical processing and storage resources, and virtualization software. In its NFV-MANO role it consists of VNF and NFVI managers and virtualization software operating on a [[Controller (computing)|hardware controller]]. The NFV platform implements carrier-grade features used to manage and monitor the platform components, recover from failures and provide effective security&amp;nbsp;– all required for the public carrier network.

==Practical aspects==
A service provider that follows the NFV design implements one or more virtualized network functions, or ''VNFs''.  A VNF by itself does not automatically provide a usable product or service to the provider's customers.  To build more complex services, the notion of ''service chaining'' is used, where multiple VNFs are used in sequence to deliver a service.

Another aspect of implementing NFV is the ''orchestration'' process. To build highly reliable and scalable services, NFV requires that the network be able to instantiate VNF instances, monitor them, repair them, and (most important for a service provider business) bill for the services rendered. These attributes, referred to as carrier-grade&lt;ref name="CG"&gt;Don’t Confuse ‘High Availability’ with [http://embedded.communities.intel.com/community/en/blog/2014/04/04/don-t-confuse-high-availability-with-carrier-grade Carrier Grade], Embedded Community, Charlie Ashton, April, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; features, are allocated to an orchestration layer in order to provide high availability and security, and low operation and maintenance costs. Importantly, the orchestration layer must be able to manage VNFs irrespective of the underlying technology within the VNF.  For example, an orchestration layer must be able to manage an [[Session border controller|SBC]] VNF from vendor X running on [[VMware]]  [[vSphere]] just as well as an [[IP Multimedia Subsystem|IMS]] VNF from vendor Y running on KVM.

==Distributed NFV==
The initial perception of NFV was that virtualized capability should be implemented in data centers. This approach works in many – but not all – cases. NFV presumes and emphasizes the widest possible flexibility as to the physical location of the virtualized functions.

Ideally, therefore, virtualized functions should be located where they are the most effective and least expensive. That means a service provider should be free to locate NFV in all possible locations, from the data center to the network node to the customer premises. This approach, known as distributed NFV, has been emphasized from the beginning as NFV was being developed and standardized, and is prominent in the recently released NFV ISG documents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title= Is "Distributed NFV" Teaching Us Something? |date= 18 September 2013 |author= Tom Nolle |work= CIMI Corporation's Public Blog |url= http://blog.cimicorp.com/?p=1453# |accessdate= 2 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For some cases there are clear advantages for a service provider to locate this virtualized functionality at the customer premises. These advantages range from economics to performance to the feasibility of the functions being virtualized.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title= RAD Rolls Out Distributed NFV Strategy |date= 3 October 2013 |author= Carol Wilson |work= Light Reading |url= http://www.lightreading.com/carrier-sdn/nfv-(network-functions-virtualization)/esdn-rad-rolls-out-distributed-nfv-strategy/d/d-id/705938 |accessdate= 2 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first ETSI NFV ISG-approved public multi-vendor [[Proof of concept#Engineering|proof of concept (PoC)]] of D-NFV was conducted by [[Cyan, Inc.]], [[RAD Data Communications|RAD]], [[Fortinet]] and Certes Networks in [[Chicago]] in June, 2014, and was sponsored by [[CenturyLink]]. It was based on RAD’s dedicated customer-edge D-NFV equipment running Fortinet’s Next Generation Firewall (NGFW) and Certes Networks’ virtual encryption/decryption engine as Virtual Network Functions (VNFs) with Cyan’s Blue Planet system orchestrating the entire ecosystem.&lt;ref name=poc&gt;{{cite news|last= |first= |title=4 Vendors Bring Distributed NFV to BTE|url=http://www.lightreading.com/4-vendors-bring-distributed-nfv-to-bte/d/d-id/709403|publisher=Light Reading|date=June 11, 2014|accessdate=March 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; RAD's D-NFV solution, a [[Data link layer|Layer 2]]/[[Network layer|Layer 3]] [[Network interface device|network termination unit (NTU)]] equipped with a D-NFV [[X86]] server module that functions as a [[virtualization engine]] at the customer edge, became commercially available by the end of that month.&lt;ref name=commerciallyavailable&gt;{{cite news|last= |first= |title=RAD launches customer-edge distributed NFV solution based on ETX NTU platform|url=http://www.opticalkeyhole.com/eventtext.asp?ID=121877&amp;pd=6/17/2014&amp;bhcp=1|work=Optical Keyhole|date=June 16, 2014|accessdate=March 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; During 2014 RAD also had organized a D-NFV Alliance, an ecosystem of vendors and international [[systems integrator]]s specializing in new NFV applications.&lt;ref name=dnfvalliance&gt;{{cite news|last= |first= |title=RAD adds new partners to D-NFV Alliance|url=http://www.telecompaper.com/news/rad-adds-new-partners-to-d-nfv-alliance--1054140|work=Telecompaper|date=December 9, 2014|accessdate=March 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==NFV modularity benefits==
When designing and developing the software that provides the VNFs, vendors may structure that software into software components (implementation view of a software architecture) and package those components into one or more images (deployment view of a software architecture). These vendor-defined software components are called VNF Components (VNFCs). VNFs are implemented with one or more VNFCs and it is assumed, without loss of generality, that VNFC instances map 1:1 to VM Images.

VNFCs should in general be able to [[Scalability|scale up and/or scale out]]. By being able to allocate flexible (virtual) CPUs to each of the VNFC instances, the network management layer can scale up (i.e., scale ''vertically'') the VNFC to provide the throughput/performance and scalability expectations over a single system or a single platform. Similarly, the network management layer can scale out (i.e., ''scale horizontally'') a VNFC by activating multiple instances of such VNFC over multiple platforms and therefore reach out to the performance and architecture specifications whilst not compromising the other VNFC function stabilities.

Early adopters of such architecture blueprints have already implemented the NFV modularity principles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=

SDN, or [[software-defined networking]], is a concept related to NFV, but they refer to different domains.&lt;ref name = Stalling2016&gt;{{cite journal|last=William|first=Stalling,|title= Foundations of Modern Networking: SDN, NFV, QoE, IoT, and Cloud |journal=  Pearson Education, |date= 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;.  
Network functions virtualization (NFV) and Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) could efficiently complement the SDN functions &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rowayda|first=A. Sadek,|title= An Agile Internet of Things (IoT) based Software Defined Network (SDN) Architecture |journal=  Egyptian Computer Science Journal, |date=May 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

In essence, software-defined networking (SDN) is an approach to build data networking equipment and software that separates and abstracts elements of these systems. It does this by decoupling the control plane and data plane from each other, such that the control plane resides centrally and the forwarding components remain distributed. The control plane interacts both [[Northbound interface|northbound]] and [[Southbound interface|southbound]]. In the northbound direction the control plane provides a common abstracted view of the network to higher-level applications and programs using APIs. In the southbound direction the control plane programs the forwarding behavior of the data plane, using device level APIs of the physical network equipment distributed around the network.

Thus, NFV is not dependent on SDN or SDN concepts. It is entirely possible to implement a virtualized network function (VNF) as a standalone entity using existing networking and orchestration paradigms. However, there are inherent benefits in leveraging SDN concepts to implement and manage an NFV infrastructure, particularly when looking at the management and orchestration of VNFs, and that's why multivendor platforms are being defined that incorporate SDN and NFV in concerted ecosystems.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cisco.com/go/esp Platform to Multivendor Virtual and Physical Infrastructure]&lt;/ref&gt;

An NFV infrastructure needs a central orchestration and management system that takes operator requests associated with a VNF, translates them into the appropriate processing, storage and network configuration needed to bring the VNF into operation. Once in operation, the VNF potentially must be monitored for capacity and utilization, and adapted if necessary.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://eu.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-1118900286.html|title=Software Defined Mobile Networks (SDMN): Beyond LTE Network Architecture.|last=Liyanage|first=Madhusanka|publisher=John Wiley|year=2015|isbn=978-1-118-90028-4|location=UK|pages=1–438|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All these functions can be accomplished using SDN concepts and NFV could be considered one of the primary SDN use cases in service provider environments. It is also apparent that many SDN use-cases could incorporate concepts introduced in the NFV initiative. Examples include where the centralized controller is controlling a distributed forwarding function that could in fact be also virtualized on existing processing or routing equipment.

==Industry impact==
NFV has proven a popular standard even in its infancy. Its immediate applications are numerous, such as virtualization of [[mobile base station]]s, [[platform as a service]] (PaaS), [[content delivery network]]s (CDN), fixed access and home environments.&lt;ref&gt;Network Functions Virtualization (NFV) [http://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_gs/NFV/001_099/001/01.01.01_60/gs_NFV001v010101p.pdf Use Cases], ETSI GS NFV 001 v1.1.1 (2013-10)&lt;/ref&gt; The potential benefits of NFV is anticipated to be significant. Virtualization of network functions deployed on general purpose standardized hardware is expected to reduce capital and operational expenditures, and service and product introduction times.&lt;ref name="benefits"&gt;What’s [http://www.sdncentral.com/whats-network-functions-virtualization-nfv/ NFV] – Network Functions Virtualization?, SDN Central&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carrier Network [http://carriernetworkvirtualization.com/company/network-functions-virtualisation-isg-nfv-etsi/ Virtualization], ETSI news&lt;/ref&gt; Many major network equipment vendors have announced support for NFV.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title= Openwave Exec Discusses the Benefits, Challenges of NFV &amp; SDN |work= Article |url= http://www.sdnzone.com/topics/software-defined-network/articles/359936-openwave-exec-discusses-benefits-challenges-nfv-sdn.htm |date= 12 November 2013 |accessdate= 22 November 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This has coincided with NFV announcements from major software suppliers who provide the NFV platforms used by equipment suppliers to build their NFV products.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.serviceprovideritreport.com/author.asp?section_id=3098 Middleware] for the NFV Generation, Service, Lee Doyle&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.policychargingcontrol.com/1643-wind-river-s-launches-nfv-ecosystem-program-with-initial-five-industry-leaders Wind River Launches] NFV Ecosystem Program with Five Industry Leaders, PCC Mobile Broadband, Ray Sharma&lt;/ref&gt;

However, to realize the anticipated benefits of virtualization, network equipment vendors are improving IT virtualization technology to incorporate carrier-grade attributes required to achieve [[high availability]], scalability, performance, and effective network management capabilities.&lt;ref&gt;'Carrier-Grade Reliability—A “[http://electronicdesign.com/communications/carrier-grade-reliability-must-have-nfv-success Must-Have]” for NFV Success', Electronic Design, Charlie Ashton, January 2015&lt;/ref&gt; To minimize the total cost of ownership (TCO), carrier-grade features must be implemented as efficiently as possible. This requires that NFV solutions make efficient use of redundant resources to achieve five-nines availability (99.999%),&lt;ref&gt;'5 [http://www2.alcatel-lucent.com/techzine/5-must-attributes-nfv-platform/ must-have attributes] of an NFV platform', Techzine, Alcatel-Lucent, Andreas Lemke, November 2014&lt;/ref&gt; and of computing resource without compromising performance predictability.

The NFV platform is the foundation for achieving efficient carrier-grade NFV solutions.&lt;ref&gt;'Why Service Providers

The NFV platform software is responsible for dynamically reassigning VNFs due to failures and changes in traffic load, and therefore plays an important role in achieving high availability. There are numerous initiatives underway to specify, align and promote NFV carrier-grade capabilities such as ETSI NFV Proof of Concept,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etsi.org/technologies-clusters/technologies/nfv/nfv-poc NFV Proof of Concept]&lt;/ref&gt; ATIS&lt;ref&gt;'New [http://www.lightreading.com/nfv/nfv-strategies/new-nfv-forum-focused-on-interoperability/d/d-id/710874 NFV Forum] Focused on Interoperability', Light Reading, Carol Wilson, September 16, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Open Platform for NFV Project,&lt;ref&gt;OPNFV, Linux Foundation Collaborative Projects Foundation webpage&lt;/ref&gt;  Carrier Network Virtualization Awards&lt;ref&gt;[http://carriernetworkvirtualization.com/carrier-network-virtualization-awards/ Carrier Network Virtualization Awards] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150607213250/http://carriernetworkvirtualization.com/carrier-network-virtualization-awards/ |date=2015-06-07 }} 2014, December 2015&lt;/ref&gt; and various supplier ecosystems.&lt;ref&gt;'Wind River’s Ecosystemic Solution to NFV and Orchestration', CIMI Corporation Public Blog, Tom Nolle, June 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

The vSwitch, a key component of NFV platforms, is responsible for providing connectivity both VM-to-VM (between VMs) and between VMs and the outside network. Its performance determines both the bandwidth of the VNFs and the cost-efficiency of NFV solutions. The standard [[Open vSwitch]]'s (OVS) performance has shortcomings that must be resolved to meet the needs of NFVI solutions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://networkheresy.com/2014/11/13/accelerating-open-vswitch-to-ludicrous-speed/ 'Accelerating Open vSwitch] to "Ludicruos Speed", Network Heresy: Tales of the network reformation, Justin D Pettit, November 13, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;  Significant performance improvements are being reported by NFV suppliers for both OVS and Accelerated Open vSwitch (AVS) versions.&lt;ref&gt;'Wind River Delivers Breakthrough Performance for [http://www.windriver.com/news/press/pr.html?ID=12801 Accelerated vSwitch] Optimized for NFV' Wind River News Room, May, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'6WIND Announces [http://www.prweb.com/releases/2014/04/prweb11768622.htm Open vSwitch Acceleration] for Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform', PRweb, April, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

Virtualization is also changing the way [[availability]] is specified, measured and achieved in NFV solutions. As VNFs replace traditional function-dedicated equipment, there is a shift from equipment-based availability to a service-based, end-to-end, layered approach.&lt;ref&gt;'NETWORK FUNCTIONS [http://www.tmcnet.com/tmc/whitepapers/documents/whitepapers/2013/9377-network-functions-virtualization-challenges-solutions.pdf VIRTUALIZATION] CHALLENGES AND SOLUTIONS', TMCNET webpage, Alcatel-Lucent Strategic paper, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'NFV: The Myth of Application-Level High [http://www.windriver.com/whitepapers/nfv-myth-app/ Availability]', Wind River White Paper, May 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Virtualizing network functions breaks the explicit coupling with specific equipment, therefore availability is defined by the availability of VNF services. Because NFV technology can virtualize a wide range of network function types, each with their own service availability expectations, NFV platforms should support a wide range of fault tolerance options. This flexibility enables CSPs to optimize their NFV solutions to meet any VNF availability requirement.

==Management and orchestration (MANO)==
[[ETSI]] has already indicated that an important part of controlling the NFV environment be done through automation and orchestration. There is a separate stream MANO within NFV outlining how flexibility should be controlled.&lt;ref&gt;[http://network-functions-virtualization.com/mano.html Mano at network-functions-virtualization.com ]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Performance study==
Recent performance study on NFV focused on the throughput, latency and jitter of virtualized network functions (VNFs), as well as NFV scalability in terms of the number of VNFs a single physical server can support.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7781548/?reload=true Toward High-Performance and Scalable Network Functions Virtualization]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15716">{{redirect|PNR}}
In the airline and travel industries, a '''passenger name record''' ('''PNR''')  is a record in the database of a [[computer reservation system]] (CRS)  that consists of the personal information for a passenger and also contains the itinerary for the passenger, or a group of passengers travelling together. The concept of a PNR was first introduced by [[airline]]s that needed to exchange reservation information in case passengers required flights of multiple airlines to reach their destination (“[[interlining]]”). For this purpose, [[IATA]] and [[Air Transport Association|ATA]] defined standards for interline messaging of PNR and other data through the "ATA/IATA Reservations Interline Message Procedures - Passenger" (AIRIMP). There is no general industry standard for the layout and content of a PNR. In practice, each CRS or hosting system has its own proprietary standards, although common industry needs, including the need to map PNR data easily to AIRIMP messages, has resulted in many general similarities in data content and format between all of the major systems.

When a passenger books an itinerary, the travel agent or travel website user will create a PNR in the CRS, which may be an airline's database or typically one of the [[global distribution system]]s (GDSs), such as [[Amadeus CRS|Amadeus]], [[Sabre (computer system)|Sabre]], or [[Travelport]] (Apollo, Galileo, and Worldspan). If a booking is made directly with of the airline's CRS, the PNR is called the Master PNR for the passenger and the associated itinerary. The PNR is identified in the CRS by a [[record locator]]. If portions of the travel itinerary are not to be provided by the holder of the Master PNR, then copies of the PNR information are sent to the CRSs of the airlines that will be providing transportation. These CRSs will open copies of the Master PNR in their own database to manage the portion of the itinerary for which they are responsible. Many airlines have their CRS hosted by one of the GDSs, which allows sharing of the PNR. The record locators of the copied PNRs are communicated back to the CRS that holds the Master PNR, so all records remain tied together. This enables exchanging updates of the PNR when the status of the trip changes in any of the CRSs.

Although PNRs were originally introduced for air travel airlines systems, they can also be used for bookings of [[hotel]]s, [[car rental]], airport transfers, and [[railways|train]] trips.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} PNRs are now routinely shared with government agencies, such as customs and security or [[law enforcement agencies]].

==Parts==
{{unreferenced section|date=June 2009}}
From a technical point, there are five parts of a PNR required before the booking can be completed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Guidelines on Passenger Name Record (PNR) Data|url=https://www.iata.org/iata/passenger-data-toolkit/assets/doc_library/04-pnr/New%20Doc%209944%201st%20Edition%20PNR.pdf|website=IATA|accessdate=12 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are:
* the name of the passenger
* contact details for the travel agent or airline office.
* ticketing details, either a ticket number or a ticketing time limit.
* itinerary of at least one segment, which must be the same for all passengers listed.
* name of the person providing the information or making the booking.

Other information, such as a timestamp and the agency's [[pseudo-city code]], will go into the booking automatically. All entered information will be retained in the "history" of the booking.

Once the booking has been completed to this level, the CRS will issue a unique all alpha or alpha-numeric record locator, which will remain the same regardless of any further changes made (except if a multi-person PNR is split). Each airline will create their own booking record with a unique record locator, which, depending on service level agreement between the CRS and the airline(s) involved, will be transmitted to the CRS and stored in the booking. If an airline uses the same CRS as the travel agency, the record locator will be the same for both. 

A considerable amount of other information is often desired by both the airlines and the travel agent to ensure efficient travel, including:

* fare details, (although the amount may be suppressed, the type of fare will be shown), and any restrictions that may apply to the ticket.
* tax amounts paid to the relevant authorities involved in the itinerary. 
* the form of payment used, as this will usually restrict any refund if the ticket is not used.
* further contact details, such as agency phone number and address, additional phone contact numbers at passenger address and intended destination.
* age details if it is relevant to the travel, e.g., unaccompanied children or elderly passengers requiring assistance.
* frequent flyer data.
* seat allocation (or seat type request). 
* special Service Requests (SSR) such as meal requirements, wheelchair assistance, and other similar requests.
* "Optional Services Instruction" or "Other Service Information" (OSI) -  information sent to a specific airline, or all airlines in the booking, which enables them to better provide a service.  This information can include ticket numbers, local contacts details (the phone section is limited to only a few entries), airline staff onload and upgrade priority codes, and other details such as a passenger's language or details of a disability.
* vendor remarks, which are comments made by the airline, typically generated automatically once the booking or request is completed. These will normally include the airline's record locator, replies to special requests, and advice on ticketing time limits. While normally sent by the airlines to an agent, it is also possible for an agent to send a VR to an airline.

In more recent times, many governments now require the airline to provide further information included to assist investigators tracing criminals or terrorists.
These include:
*Passengers' gender
*Passport details - nationality, number, and date of expiry
*Date and place of birth
*Redress number, (if previously given to the passenger by the US authorities).
*All available payment/billing information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=EU: European Commission to propose EU PNR travel surveillance system|url=http://www.statewatch.org/news/2007/jul/03eu-pnr.htm|accessdate=14 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The components of a PNR are identified internally in a CRS by a one character code. This code is often used when creating a PNR via direct entry into a terminal window (as opposed to using a graphical interface). The following codes are standard across all CRSs based on the original PARS system:
* - Name
* 0 Segment (flight) information, including number of seats booked, status code (for example HK1 - confirmed for 1 passenger) and fare class
* 1 Related PNR record ids.
* 2 PNR owner identification (airline, CRS user name and role)
* 3 Other airline Other Service Information (OSI) or Special Service Request (SSR) items
* 4 Host airline OSI or SSR items
* 5 Remarks
* 6 Received from
* 7 Ticketing information (including ticket number)
* 8 Ticketing time limit
* 9 Contact phone numbers

==Storage==
The majority of airlines and travel agencies choose to host their PNR databases with a computer reservations system (CRS) or global distribution system (GDS) company such as [[Sabre (computer system)|Sabre]], [[Galileo CRS|Galileo]], [[Worldspan]] and [[Amadeus CRS|Amadeus]].&lt;ref&gt;Strauss, Michael (2010): Value Creation in Travel Distribution, https://www.amazon.com/dp/0557612462&lt;/ref&gt;

==Privacy concerns==
Some privacy organizations are concerned at the amount of personal data that a PNR might contain.  While the minimum data for completing a booking is quite small, a PNR will typically contain much more information of a sensitive nature.
This will include the passenger’s full name, date of birth, home and work address, telephone number, e-mail address, credit card details, IP address if booked online, as well as the names and personal information of emergency [https://ec.europa.eu/home-affairs/what-we-do/policies/police-cooperation/information-exchange/pnr_en contacts].  The PNR data in part can be accessed through the airline website by using a 6-character [https://ourdataourselves.tacticaltech.org/posts/50-booking-flights/?mc_cid=f9c87f977d&amp;mc_eid=828caddd2a alphanumeric] record locator code.  This code can also be found in boarding pass [https://red-goat.com/social-engineering/boarding_passes/ barcodes].

Designed to “facilitate easy global sharing of PNR data,” the CRS-GDS companies “function both as data warehouses and data aggregators, and have a relationship to travel data analogous to that of credit bureaus to financial data.”.&lt;ref&gt;Electronic Privacy Information Center, Privacy &amp; Human Rights – An International Survey of Privacy Laws and Developments 2004, 81.&lt;/ref&gt;   A canceled or completed trip does not erase the record since “copies of the PNRs are ‘purged’ from live to archival storage systems, and can be retained indefinitely by CRSs, airlines, and travel agencies.”&lt;ref&gt;Privacy &amp; Human Rights, 81.&lt;/ref&gt; Further, CRS-GDS companies maintain web sites that allow almost unrestricted access to PNR data – often, the information is accessible by just the reservation number printed on the ticket.

Additionally, “[t]hrough billing, meeting, and discount eligibility codes, PNRs contain detailed information on patterns of association between travelers. PNRs can contain religious meal preferences and special service requests that describe details of physical and medical conditions (e.g., “Uses wheelchair, can control bowels and bladder”) – categories of information that have special protected status in the European Union and some other countries as [[sensitive information|“sensitive” personal data.”]]&lt;ref name="Privacy &amp; Human Rights, 80"&gt;Privacy &amp; Human Rights, 80.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the sensitive character of the information they contain, PNRs are generally not recognized as deserving the same privacy protection afforded to medical and financial records.  Instead, they are treated as a form of commercial transaction data.&lt;ref name="Privacy &amp; Human Rights, 80"/&gt;

==European Union==
After years of debate, the [[European Parliament]] approved on 14 April 2016 the PNR [[European directive|directive]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?pubRef=-//EP//TEXT+TA+P8-TA-2016-0127+0+DOC+XML+V0//EN Texts adopted], European Parliament&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/nl/news-room/20150123BKG12902/eu-passenger-name-record-(pnr)-directive-an-overview EU Passenger Name Record (PNR) directive: an overview] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170104090908/http://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/nl/news-room/20150123BKG12902/eu-passenger-name-record-(pnr)-directive-an-overview |date=2017-01-04 }}, European Parliament&lt;/ref&gt; This directive 2016/681 will oblige [[airline]]s to collect their passengers' data and hand them over to the EU member states.

The Belgian [[Chamber of Representatives (Belgium)|Chamber of Representatives]] approved on 22 December 2016 a draft law to [[Transposition (law)|transpose]] the European directive in a Belgian legislative framework.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dekamer.be/kvvcr/showpage.cfm?section=/flwb&amp;language=nl&amp;cfm=/site/wwwcfm/flwb/flwbn.cfm?legislat=54&amp;dossierID=2069 Wetsontwerp betreffende de verwerking van passagiersgegevens], Chamber of Representatives&lt;/ref&gt; This law goes further and aims the recording of train passengers' data as well.

==International PNR sharing agreements==

===European Union to United States===

See [[United States–European Union Agreement on Passenger Name Records]].

===European Union to Australia===
On January 16, 2004, the [[Article 29 Working Party]] released their ''Opinion 1/2004 (WP85)'' on the level of PNR protection ensured in Australia for the transmission of Passenger Name Record data from airlines.
:''Customs applies a general policy of non retention for these data. For those 0.05% to 0.1% of passengers who are referred to Customs for further evaluation, the airline PNR data are temporarily retained, but not stored, pending resolution of the border evaluation. After resolution, their PNR data are erased from the PC of the Customs PAU officer concerned and are not entered into Australian databases.''

In 2010 the European Commission's [[Directorate-General for Justice, Freedom and Security]] was split in two.  The resulting bodies were the [[Directorate-General for Justice (European Commission)]] and the [[Directorate-General for Home Affairs (European Commission)]]&lt;!-- note: freedom apparently fell off the radar! --&gt;.

On the 4th of May 2011, [[Stefano Manservisi]], Director-General at the [[Directorate-General for Home Affairs (European Commission)]] wrote to the [[European Data Protection Supervisor]] (EDPS) with regards to a PNR sharing agreement with Australia,&lt;ref name=0420d845&gt;{{cite web|title=Letter 0420 D845|url=http://www.asktheeu.org/en/request/information_on_pnr_agreements#incoming-588|publisher=European Data Protection Supervisor|accessdate=19 September 2012|date=2011-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; a close ally of the US and signatory to the [[UKUSA Agreement]] on [[signals intelligence]].

The EDPS responded on the 5th of May in ''[http://www.asktheeu.org/en/request/information_on_pnr_agreements#incoming-588 Letter 0420 D845]'':
:''I am writing to you in reply to your letter of 4 May concerning the two draft Proposals for Council Decisions on (i) the conclusion and (ii) the signature of the Agreement between the European Union and Australia on the processing and transfer of Passenger Name Record (PNR) data by air carriers to the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service.''
:''We understand that the consultation of the EDPS takes place in the context of a fast track procedure. However, '''we regret that the time available for us to analyse the Proposal is reduced to a single day. Such a deadline precludes the EDPS from being able to exercise its competences in an appropriate way''', even in the context of a file which we have been closely following since 2007.''

===European Union to Canada===
The [[Article 29 Working Party]] document ''[http://ec.europa.eu/justice/policies/privacy/docs/wpdocs/2005/wp103_en.pdf Opinion 1/2005 on the level of protection ensured in Canada for the transmission of Passenger Name Record and Advance Passenger Information from airlines (WP 103)]'', 19 January 2005, offers information on the nature of agreements with [[Canada]].

It is a blue-domed structure that is situated on top of a hill in the Lake Gardens at [[List of roads in Kuala Lumpur#Other roads|Jalan Perdana]], [[Kuala Lumpur]]. It is about {{convert|120000|sqft|m2}} in area.

==History==
The National Planetarium started as the Planetarium Division in the Prime Minister's Department in 1989. The construction of the National Planetarium complex began in 1990 and was completed in 1993. A soft launch to the public began in May 1993 and it was officially opened by the [[Prime Minister of Malaysia]], [[Mahathir bin Mohamad]], on 7 February 1994. In July 1995, the Division was transferred to the Ministry of Science, Technology and the Environment, which is also the owner of this planetarium until now.

==Exhibits and attractions==
One of the major attractions of this planetarium includes a space theatre which screens space shows and large format film.

In the main hall are permanent exhibits related to space science. Among them is Arianne IV space engine, which is also one of the engines used to launch [[MEASAT#MEASAT-1 and MEASAT-2|MEASAT 1]], Malaysia's first satellite into space. A {{convert|14|in|mm|sing=on}} telescope is located in the observatory.

The National Planetarium extends to a space theme park where replicas of ancient observatories are sited. It is connected by an overhead pedestrian bridge to the [[National Museum (Malaysia)|National Museum of Malaysia]].

==Operating hours==
The planetarium is opened daily from 9.00 am to 4.30 pm (except on Monday, Hari Raya Puasa holiday, Hari Raya Haji holiday and public holidays as stated by the Planetarium Negara). The planetarium shows will be aired every one hour starting at 10am and the last show will be at 4pm. The entrance to the gallery is free and the shows ticket is RM 12 for adult (per person) and RM 8 for children (per person).

==Transportation==
The planetarium is accessible within walking distance west of [[Kuala Lumpur railway station]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5165">[[File:Principle of plunger lift.jpg|thumb|300px|The stages of operation of a plunger lift.]]
A '''plunger lift''' is an [[artificial lift]] method of [[gas well deliquification|deliquifying a natural gas well]]. A [[plunger]] is used to remove contaminants from productive [[natural gas]] wells, such as water (in liquid, mist, or ice forms), sand, oil and wax.

The basics of the plunger is to open and close the well shutoff valve at the optimum times, to bring up the plunger and the contaminants and maximize natural gas production. A well without a deliquification technique will stop flowing or slow down and become a non-productive well, long before a properly deliquified well.&lt;ref&gt;http://blogs.mail.ru/mail/v_sh38/&lt;/ref&gt;

The plunger lift has low energy cost, low environmental impact, low capital [[investment]] and low maintenance cost. Modern wellhead controllers offer a variety of criteria to control the [[plunger]]. The original controllers were just timers, with fixed open and close cycles.

Measuring the various pressures in the system allows intelligent and reactive control. The pressures often measured are casing, tubing, line, and differential (DP). The other items measured are plunger arrival times, flow rates, [[temperature]]s and status of various auxiliary equipment: oil tank level, [[Gas compressor|compressor]] status.

==Open Well Criteria==
* Plunger Drop Timer - Minimum close time to allow the Plunger to reach the bottom.
* Tube - Line Pressure
* Casing - Line Pressure
* Casing - Tubing Pressure
* Load Ratio (Casing-Tubing) / (Casing - Line)
* Foss and Gaul Equation&lt;ref&gt;Foss, D.L., and Gaul, R.B., "Plunger Lift Performance Criteria with Operating Experience - Ventura Avenue Field", (API Drilling and Production Practice,) 1965.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Tubing Pressure
* Casing Pressure
* Static Pressure
* External Variables

==Close Well Criteria==
* Flow Time
* After Flow Timer
* Turner/Coleman Flow Rate
* Load Ratio
* DP ([[Differential (mechanical device)|Differential]])
* Flow Rate
* Tubing - Line Pressure
* Casing - Tubing Pressure
* Casing Pressure
* Static Pressure
* Tubing Pressure
* Line Pressure

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2581">[[File:Large roasting pan with rack.jpg|thumb|A large roasting pan with a removable rack and a non-stick surface coating.]]
A '''roasting pan''' is a piece of cookware used for [[roasting]] meat in an oven, either with or without vegetables or other ingredients. A roasting pan may be used with a rack that sits inside the pan and lets the meat sit above the fat and juice drippings.

A shallow roasting pan is normally used for roasting small cuts of meat, but large-size roasting pans are also used for cooking large poultry such as turkey or goose, or for larger cuts of meat. A deep roasting pan can hold vegetables and other ingredients that meat can sit on rather than a rack, letting the vegetables absorb the fat and juice from the meat while cooking. A deep roasting pan can also be used as a baking dish or basin, holding smaller baking dishes that must be surrounded by boiling water.&lt;ref name=ffc&gt;{{cite book|last=Cunningham|first=Marion|title=The Fannie Farmer Cookbook|year=1996|publisher=Alfred A. Knopf|location=New York|isbn=0-679-45081-5|pages=30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Materials==
Roasting pans are made in several materials that offer their own unique benefits:
* Aluminum foil: inexpensive and disposable after one use
* Stainless steel: may have a non-stick coating
* Coated [[enamelware]]: has a non-stick surface
* Cast iron: [[cast-iron cookware]] conducts heat well and can be used to brown meat on the stovetop before placing into the oven for roasting
* Clay cooker: a covered clay pot can brown food if the temperature of the oven is raised toward the end of cooking &lt;ref name=ffc /&gt;

==Covered or uncovered roasting pans==
Covering or uncovering a roasting pan will depend upon the type of meat being roasted, or the recipe being followed. Generally, meat that is high in fat content, such as duck, has no need of being covered during roasting. A lean cut of meat, however, will benefit from being covered during a long roasting time, to retain juices and soften the meat (for example, in using a [[tajine]] for roasting meat).

==Roasting racks==
A roasting rack may be an accessory part of the roasting pan. A rack may be horizontal and lay flat on the roasting pan, or it may be a standing rack that sits vertically in the pan. A standing rack is most commonly used for roasting poultry. A variation of the roasting pan standing rack is the [[beer can chicken]] recipe.

'''Shaker furniture''' is a distinctive style of [[furniture]] developed by the United Society of Believers in Christ's Second Appearing, commonly known as [[Shakers]], a religious sect that had guiding principles of [[Testimony of Simplicity|simplicity]], utility and honesty. Their beliefs were reflected in the well-made furniture of minimalist designs.&lt;ref name="Met" /&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Shaker communities were largely self-sufficient: in their attempt to separate themselves from the outside world and to create a heaven-on-earth, members grew their own food, constructed their own buildings, and manufactured their own tools and household furnishings.—[[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]&lt;ref name="Met"&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/shak/hd_shak.htm ''Shaker furniture''.] Metropolitan Museum of Art. Retrieved March 23, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Furniture was made thoughtfully, with functional form and proportion. Rather than using  ornamentation — such as [[inlay]]s, [[carving]]s, metal pulls, or [[wood veneer|veneers]] — which was seen as prideful or deceitful, they developed "creative solutions such as asymmetrical drawer arrangements and multipurpose forms to add visual interest." Furniture was made of cherry, maple or pine lumber, which was generally stained or painted with one of the colors which were dictated by the sect, typically blue, red, yellow or green. Drawer pulls for dressers or other furniture were made of wood.&lt;ref name="Met" /&gt;

A core business for the [[Mount Lebanon Shaker Society|New Lebanon Shaker community]] by the 1860s was the production of well-made "ladder" back or turned post chairs. The minimalist design and woven seats were fast and easy to produce. Furniture built and used by the New Lebanon "believers" is exhibited in the Shaker Retiring Room at the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in [[New York City]], which originated from the [[Shaker Museum and Library|North Family]] Shakers' 1818 First Dwelling House. The furniture, acquired in the 1970s, and Shaker textiles are considered among the finest Shaker collections in the world.&lt;ref name="Met" /&gt;

Many examples of Shaker furniture survive and are preserved today, including such popular forms as Shaker tables, chairs, rocking chairs (made in several sizes), and cabinets. Collections of Shaker furniture are maintained by many art and historical museums in the United States and the United Kingdom, as well as in numerous private collections including the [[Shaker tilting chair]]. The underlying principles of Shaker design have given inspiration to some of the finest designers of modern furniture. Shaker ladder back chairs, for instance, deeply influenced the work of an entire generation of postwar Danish designers. &lt;ref&gt;Taft, Maggie, "Morphologies and Genealogies: Shaker Furniture and Danish Design," Design and Culture, 7:3, 313-334.&lt;/ref&gt; Also many ideals of furniture formed around the common Shaker furniture construction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Krogh|first=Frank|title=The Thesis of Comfort|year=1994|publisher=Peguin|location=Reno, Nevada|pages=287}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''stand guidance system''' is a system which gives information to a pilot attempting to park an aircraft at an airport stand, usually via visual methods, leading to the term '''''Visual Docking Guidance System''''' (VDGS) and also ''A-VDGS'' (the A standing for advanced) This allows them to remain clear of obstructions and ensures that [[jetways]] can reach the aircraft.

==AGNIS VDGS==
'''Azimuth Guidance for Nose-In Stand''' is one of the most popular forms of stand guidance. It consists of two coloured lights mounted side by side.

If the pilot is on the stand centreline they will see two green lights. If they are off centreline, one of the lights will appear red and the pilot then steers towards the green one. AGNIS alone provides only azimuth guidance, it does not inform pilots when they should stop. It is relatively imprecise but cheap to implement and reliable.

===PAPA===
[[Image:AGNIS-PAPA.svg|thumb|240px|'''AGNIS''' is shown on the left, in this example the aircraft is right of the centreline.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; On the right is a prototypical '''PAPA''', which features no moving parts or electronics.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; The two systems are not shown to scale, an AGNIS lightbox is many times smaller than a PAPA box]]
The '''Parallax Aircraft Parking Aid''' is frequently combined with an AGNIS system, informing flight crews when to stop. The device features no electronics or moving parts; it consists simply of a large grey box (usually with one or more sides missing) with a large rectangular slot cut into the front.

Inside the box, towards the rear, is a white stick or fluorescent tube, which appears to move from one side of the slot to the other as the viewer moves closer, although it is in fact fixed and the effect is merely due to perspective (see [[parallax]]).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.caa.co.uk/docs/33/CAP637.PDF CAP637 Visual Aids Handbook; CAA Issue 2, May 2007; Chapter 4, Figure 4.2.&lt;/ref&gt; Above and/or below this slot will be markings in white or yellow, indicating where different types of plane should stop.

As this system relies on the position of the viewer, it will not give accurate distance information to aircraft which have deviated significantly from the stand centreline.

===Stop light===
This is a simple two phase [[traffic light]] with red and green lights, mounted to the side of the AGNIS lights. Typically these are round and mounted vertically, in order to avoid confusion to AGNIS lights which are also red and green but mounted side by side and usually square.

===Mirror===
Used in combination with AGNIS at stands which can only accept smaller airliners, it features one or two mirrors, allowing the flightcrew to see ground markings in relation to their nose wheel, when it is within the area they need to stop. Typically two mirrors are used, angled differently to suit the various heights of cockpits from the ground.

==A-VDGS==
'''Advanced Visual Docking Guidance Systems''' feature electronic displays which perform the functions of an AGNIS/PAPA installation, although with much greater accuracy. They may also provide collision avoidance from static objects.
An infrared high definition camera is scanning the entire area for possible objects, affecting the safety of the aircraft. 
The usual distance is from 8–50 meters . The A-VGDS, is equipped with a low visibility function allowing aircraft to park in extremely poor visibility conditions .

A-VDGS systems usually have emergency stop buttons located both on the stand and in the jetway/gate area, which causes the stop indication to appear immediately.

===RLG===
[[File:RLG Site.jpg|thumb|253x253px|RLG GIS 206-2 at klia2, Malaysia]]
'''RLG GIS-206''' product line which utilizes cutting-edge laser technology to reduce error margins, enhance ease-of-use and installation. Accommodate all aircraft types without the error factors resulting from variations in aircraft height and gross weight. All RLG docking systems comply with ICAO Annex 14 recommendations.

===FMT===

'''The Aircraft Positioning and Information System (APIS++)''' is manufactured by FMT.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fmt.se/index.php?id=85 FMT VDGS page, accessed 27 Feb 09&lt;/ref&gt; The left side of the unit displays Azimuth guidance; providing the pilot with vital information when as far as 200 meters from the stand and while the aircraft is still perpendicular to the stand centreline. The right side of the unit gives the pilot precise information concerning closing rate as well as instructions when to stop.

The azimuth guidance, based on the [[ Moiré pattern | Moiré Pattern]] works independently of the laser that calculates distance to stop and is unaffected by weather conditions.

The laser, which has a pulse frequency of 9.6&amp;nbsp;kHz and a resolution of 1&amp;nbsp;cm, ensures that the pilot can stop in the exact stopping position. The system can be connected with the passenger boarding bridge, apron management system or other airport systems via TCP/IP or Ethernet connections. It can also be equipped with a back-up traffic light system.

Red and yellow arrows indicate in which direction the pilot needs to manoeuvre to be on the centreline. Each model has an S variant (e.g. T1S), which also indicates the position of the aircraft relative to the centreline. In either variant, a central yellow column disappears from bottom to top as the aircraft approaches the stop point.

==Marshaller==
{{main|Aircraft marshalling}}
Marshallers use a variety of arm signals to indicate where aircraft are in relation to both the stop line and the centreline. Signals used by marshallers can vary between countries and services (for example, some may be specific to aircraft carriers).

'''Switching circuit theory''' is the mathematical study of the properties of networks of idealized switches. Such networks may be strictly [[combinational logic]], in which their output state is only a function of the present state of their inputs; or may also contain [[Sequential logic|sequential elements]], where the present state depends on the present state and past states; in that sense, sequential circuits are said to include "memory" of past states. An important class of sequential circuits are [[state machine]]s. Switching circuit theory is applicable to the design of telephone systems, computers, and similar systems. Switching circuit theory provided the mathematical foundations and tools for [[Digital electronics|digital system]] design in almost all areas of modern technology.&lt;ref name="nakashima"/&gt;

From 1934 to 1936, [[NEC]] engineer Akira Nakashima published a series of papers showing that the [[Two-element Boolean algebra|two-valued Boolean algebra]], which he discovered independently, can describe the operation of switching circuits.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/ieejfms/124/8/124_8_720/_article History of Research on Switching Theory in Japan], ''IEEJ Transactions on Fundamentals and Materials'', Vol. 124 (2004) No. 8, pp. 720-726, [[Institute of Electrical Engineers of Japan]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://museum.ipsj.or.jp/en/computer/dawn/0002.html Switching Theory/Relay Circuit Network Theory/Theory of Logical Mathematics], IPSJ Computer Museum, [[Information Processing Society of Japan]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="historical"&gt;Radomir S.

Ideal switches are considered as having only two exclusive states, for example, open or closed. In some analysis, the state of a switch can be considered to have no influence on the output of the system and is designated as a "don't care" state. In complex networks it is necessary to also account for the finite switching time of physical switches; where two or more different paths in a network may affect the output, these delays may result in a [[Hazard (logic)|"logic hazard"]]  or "[[race condition]]" where the output state changes due to the different propagation times through the network.

The Biosphere Rules is a framework for implementing closed loop production in business. They emerged from a 2005 research project at [[IE Business School]] that identified the principles that facilitate circular processes in nature but interpreted for&amp;mdash;and translated to&amp;mdash;industrial production systems. The research indicated that adopting the principles allowed businesses to establish economically and environmentally sustainable [[Closed loop manufacturing|closed-loop]] manufacturing systems.

The five principles that constitute the Biosphere Rules are briefly:

'''1. Materials parsimony.'''

Minimize the types of materials used in products with a focus on materials that are life-friendly and economically recyclable.

'''2. Value cycle.'''

Recover and reincarnate materials from end-of-use goods into new value-added products.

'''3. Power autonomy.'''

Maximize the power autonomy of products and processes so they can function on renewable energy.

'''4. Sustainable product platforms.'''

Leverage value cycles as product platforms for profitable scale, scope, and knowledge economies.

'''5. Function over form.'''

Fulfill customers’ functional needs in ways that sustain the value cycle.

This [[Biomimicry|biomimetic]] framework contends that these principles facilitate the transition of human manufacturing systems business towards a functioning circular economy.

== Origins ==
The Biosphere Rules emerged from a research program established through a 2005 partnership between the renowned eco-designer William McDonough and the [https://web.archive.org/web/20060206061342/http://www.ceim.ie.edu/ Center for Eco-Intelligent Management] at [http://www.ie.edu/business-school/ IE Business School], a top-ranked European management institute.  The research program identified the attributes of natural systems that allowed for the closed-loop production of organisms in the biosphere. These attributes were then used as a framework for analyzing concrete company examples in the program’s second phase.  Case studies of first mover companies adopting [[Closed loop manufacturing|closed loop]] or [[cradle-to-cradle design]] for product development found common elements that made closed-loop systems viable in a business context. Importantly, the identified elements were similar to the principles seen in natural systems, mapped onto human manufacturing approaches.

The principles were first published in the February 2008 issue the [[Harvard Business Review]] in an article entitled “The Biosphere Rules.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Unruh|first=Gregory|year=2008|title=The Biosphere Rules|url=|journal=Harvard Business Review|volume=86.2|pages=111–117|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were later expanded upon in a book entitled “Earth, Inc.: Using Nature’s Rules to Build Sustainable Profits”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Earth, Inc.: Using nature's rules to build sustainable profits|last=Unruh|first=Gregory|publisher=Harvard Business Press|year=2013|isbn=1422127176|location=USA|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; published in 2010 by the Harvard Business School Press.

== The Five Biosphere Rules ==

'''Rule #1: Materials Parsimony'''

The Materials Parsimony rule deals with constraining the number of '''types''' of materials used in product design and manufacturing. This is not to be confused with the sustainable business strategy of [[eco-efficiency]] which seeks to reduce the '''amount''' of materials used in production.

The parsimony rule comes instead from applying a biomimicry perspective to materials in the biosphere. The [[Periodic table|Periodic Table of the Elements]] encompass the 88 naturally occurring elements from arsenic to xenon. Yet despite this diversity of options, the biosphere relies on four elements—carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen ([[CHON]])—as the foundation of every living thing on earth. Adding trace amounts of sulfur, phosphorus and calcium we can account for the weight of 99 percent of every living thing on the planet. Parsimony in the biosphere makes it possible break down an organism like a rabbit locally and reassemble its constituent materials into a tree, mushroom or even another rabbit.

The functional benefit of materials parsimony for circular economy is that it dramatically simplifies the logistics and transaction costs of recycling, while producing scale economies through supply concentration.  Applying the Materials Parsimony rule to industry requires simplifying of the number and types of materials used in products. While expecting business to use the same four elements as nature is currently impractical, businesses can dramatically reduce the number of materials employed in manufacture, with a small number doing the yeoman’s work. For special isolated applications, a smaller set of select materials could be reserved and designed to be easily separated from the bulk of the product.  By making these choices, business could absorb a large percent of production within a [[Circular economy|circular materials economy]].

A first step towards materials parsimony that some companies are using is the materials sourcing strategy known as “green screening,” which seeks to exclude potentially hazardous materials from products. Limiting the “materials palette” to environmentally benign inputs at the design stage makes dealing with product and process waste much easier. It also can have the effect of dramatically reducing the number of materials in the product designer’s pallet. Beyond green screening, the emerging strategy of uni-materialization or monomateriality takes the material parsimony approach to its logical extreme by seeking to design products from a single material.

'''Rule #2: Value Cycling'''

The second principle - Value Cycling - refers to the actual cyclical reuse of materials from one high value use to another. It is called a “value cycle” to differentiate from the “[[value chain]]” model that is typical of current production approaches, whereby raw materials are converted into products and then into waste in a linear stepwise process.

In the biosphere, value cycling occurs at the atomic and molecular levels. The same materials that compose a leaf can be decomposed and incorporated into a new tree, a worm or other organisms. Technological limitations generally constrain human manufacturing system’s ability to mimic natural molecular cycling, but the approach can be applied analogously at different levels. Materials in products can be value cycled in “shallow loops” or “deep loops”.

With “shallow-loop” cycling, manufacturers adopt recycling at the “components level” through the [[Remanufacturing|remanufacture]],  refurbishment or reuse of product parts and components. In contrast, “deep-loop” recycling refers to the regeneration at the material level. Currently a limited number of materials can be deep-loop value cycled, such as metals, glass and some plastics. As [[green chemistry]] research results in new polymers that can be recycled at the materials level, greater adoption of deep-loop value cycling approaches can be implemented.

'''Rule #3: Power Autonomy'''

Every transformation of materials in nature - from turtle to tree - requires energy. In nature, the energy source is solar power captured biologically through [[photosynthesis]]. A tree’s captured energy can then be transferred throughout ecosystems through the [[Trophic level|trophic pyramid]] to herbivores and carnivores. Plants and animals also have inherent biological processes that absorb energy and store it in chemical form for later use. [[Solar energy]] therefore serves as the basis of the biosphere’s transformations of material.

Human manufacturing, in contrast, has relied primarily on [[fossil fuel]]s like oil, gas and coal to extract and transform materials. Fossil fuels cannot be considered a sustainable energy solution for many reasons, including the fact that they are finite and their exploitation is reversing important planetary biogeochemical processes producing unwanted climatic and ecosystem impacts. The power autonomy rule applied to human manufacturing requires that products and production processes run on solar-motivated renewable energy sources as in the biosphere.

The power autonomy approach sees this occurring in a two step process.  The first step is to increase the [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] products and production processes. As energy efficiency increases new options for generation and energy storage open up because less total energy is needed. The [[renewable energy]] technologies and energy storage technologies can be adopted that move the business towards a state of autonomous power generation.

Power autonomy can be seen from a [[fractal]] perspective in that it can occur at many levels. Power autonomy at the product level would be implemented by designing products that can capture and store their own energy. At the corporate level, a power autonomous company could be one that generates all its energy use from renewable sources. And power autonomy can be considered at the city or state level as in the concept of [[United States energy independence|energy independence]].

'''Rule #4: Sustainable Product Platforms'''

It is estimated that there 8.7 million [[Global biodiversity|species]] on the planet, yet all this diversity is built upon a single materials and energy platform consisting of a solar powered value cycle and a parsimonious materials pallet (CHON).   Nature’s platform allows economies of scale, scope and knowledge that drive the proliferation of species into every habitable niche on the planet. [[Economies of scale|Scale economies]] occur through reproduction and the duplicative growth of species population. [[Economies of scope|Scope economies]], on the other hand, come through speciation, the evolutionary emergence of new species, based on the same platform as individual species. Finally, knowledge economies arise through the accumulative encoding, refining and sharing of survival information genetically overtime in DNA.

The Sustainable Production Platform principle allows businesses to emulate nature’s platform approach in manufacturing and generate similar economies. A sustainable product platform consists of a parsimonious materials palette and associated processing technologies that are assembled into a power autonomous value cycle that is flexible enough to produce a wide variety of products. If managers only use this system to produce a single product, the realized increasing returns would come solely from scale economies (spreading the fixed costs over an increasing unit output). Henry Ford exploited economies of scale by efficiently [[Mass production|mass-producing]] a single car, the Model-T. But by treating the materials-process combination as a fundamental design platform and leveraging it across an entire family of products, managers can foster the scale, scope, and knowledge economies that will continually optimize the value cycle and build larger and more durable returns for their business and society.  In the 1920s, General Motors began exploiting an economy of scope by offering a variety of vehicle designs and brands built on a single automobile design platform.

Sustainable Product Platforms can be built across a spectrum of governance options. At one end manufacturers can [[Vertical integration|vertically integrate]] all the stages of the value cycle retaining full ownership of their materials and product components. At the other extreme, value cycles can be completely open source where materials are value cycled through market forces. This is the case for most commodity recycling today such as steel and aluminum.

'''Rule #5: Function Over Form'''

Throughout the geological record, there is evidence of nature’s constant evolutionary experimentation with life forms. Over billions of years, nature has produced innumerable species in an effort to take advantage of every ecological opportunity. But despite this evident diversity of forms, there are clear patterns in the ecological functions organisms fulfill.  Classes of organisms – producers, predators, pollinators, parasites – serve specific ecosystem functions. The form and its function are encoded in the genes of species, which allow the distributed local manufacturing of organisms necessary to fulfill needed ecosystem functions within the context of a globally integrated system.

In contrast, human manufacturing has tended to emphasize the commercialization of a specific product form rather than the underlying function that the product is intended to serve. Implementing the Biosphere Rules requires that engineers to shift design thinking towards providing a desired function, using the capabilities of the sustainable product platform as a design constraint on form. This approach logically leads to [[Service economy|servicization]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rothenberg|first=Sandra|year=2007|title=Sustainability through servicizing|url=|journal=MIT Sloan management review|volume=48.2|pages=83|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and product of service strategies.

== Implementation ==
Implementing the Biosphere Rules at an established company require longterm strategic commitments and investment and there are many organizational and other barriers to adopting circular economy practices. The Biosphere Rules, however, were designed in a modular fashion that allows for stepwise implementation. A company can take action to review its input sourcing decisions and move towards greater materials parsimony without having to implement all the other rules simultaneously. Other rules can be implemented in a similar sequential manner which eases the disruption to existing systems and helps facilitate a smooth transition towards a circular business model. However, the ultimate goal is an integrated sustainable business system.

== Description ==
Through-the-lens metering is most often associated with [[single-lens reflex camera|single-lens reflex]] (SLR) cameras.

In most film and digital SLRs, the light sensor(s) for exposure metering are incorporated into the [[pentaprism]] or [[pentamirror]], the mechanism by which a SLR allows the viewfinder to see directly through the lens. As the mirror is flipped up, no light can reach there during exposure, the necessary amount of exposure needs to be determined before the actual exposure. Consequently, these light sensors could traditionally be used for ambient light TTL metering only. In newer SLRs as well as in almost all DSLRs, they can also be utilized for preflash TTL metering, where the metering is carried out before the mirror flips up using a small preflash of known intensity and the necessary amount of flash light is extrapolated from the reflected flash light measured by the metering cells in the roof of the camera and is then applied during the exposure without any possible real-time feedback.

There were a few particularly sophisticated film SLRs including the [[Olympus OM-2]], the [[Pentax LX]], the [[Nikon F3]], and the [[Minolta 9000]], where metering cells located at the bottom of the mirror box were used for ambient light metering, depending on model either instead or in addition to metering cells in the roof of the camera. Depending on model, the light was reflected down there either by a secondary mirror behind the half-transparent main mirror, a special reflective coating of the first shutter curtain, the surface of the film itself, or combinations thereof. One of the advantages of this approach is that the measuring result requires no adjustments when changing focusing screens or viewfinders. Also, some of the cameras using this configuration (f.e. the Minolta 9000) are virtually immune against measurement errors caused by light reaching the metering cells at larger angles, for example with shift/tilt lenses.

Metering cells located at the bottom of the mirror box using light reflected off the film are also used in all film SLRs supporting the classical form of real-time TTL flash metering.

Some early Pentax DSLRs could use this same configuration for TTL flash metering as well, but since the reflectance properties of image sensors differ significantly from those of film, this method proved to be unreliable in practice.&lt;!-- TBD. Some early DSLRs of other vendors like the Minolta MS-C1100 or RD-175/Agfa ActionCam might have used similar methods. --&gt; Therefore, digital SLR cameras typically don't support any real-time TTL flash metering and must use preflash metering instead. The ambient and flash light metering is then carried out by a metering module located in the roof of the camera (see above).

Digital SLRs supporting live view or video will use the read out of the image sensor itself for exposure metering in these modes. This also applies to [[Sony|Sony's]] [[Sony SLT camera|SLT]] digital cameras, which use the image sensor for exposure metering all the time.
Up to the time of this writing (2012), no digital SLR or SLT camera on the market supported any form of real-time TTL flash metering using the image sensor. However, it can be expected that such methods will be introduced as image sensor technology progresses, given the advantages of metering with real-time feedback and without preflash.

TTL metering systems have been incorporated into other types of cameras as well. Most digital "[[point-and-shoot camera]]s" use TTL metering, performed by the imaging sensor itself.

In many advanced modern cameras multiple 'segments' are used to acquire the amount of light in different places of the picture. Depending on the mode the photographer has selected, this information is then used to correctly set the exposure. With a simple spot meter, a single spot on the picture is selected. The camera sets the exposure in order to get that particular spot properly exposed. On some modern SLR systems the spot metering area or zone can be coupled to the actual focusing area selected offering more flexibility and less need to use exposure lock systems. With multiple segment metering (also known as matrix or honeycomb metering), the values of the different segments are combined and weighted to set the correct exposure. Implementations of these metering modes vary between cameras and manufacturers, making it difficult to predict how a scene will be exposed when switching cameras.

== Off the film metering ==
In the 1970s Olympus marketed the [[Olympus OM-2|OM-2]] camera, which measured the exposure directly off the film (OTF). In OTF metering used by Olympus, metering was performed in one of two ways — or a combination of both — depending upon the shutter speed in use.&lt;ref name="mir"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mir.com.my/rb/photography/hardwares/classics/olympusom1n2/shared/flash/|title=Olympus OM Flash Photography - Part 1|author=|date=|website=www.mir.com.my|accessdate=23 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the OM-2's '''Auto Dynamic Metering''' ('''ADM''') system the first shutter curtain had the lens-facing side coated with a computer generated pattern of white blocks to emulate an average scene. As the mirror flipped-up the metering cell in the base of the mirror box measured the light reflected from the subject bouncing off this pattern of blocks. The timing of the release of the second curtain was adjusted in real time during the actual exposure. As the shutter speed increased, the actual light reflecting off the film surface was measured and the timing of the second curtain's release adjusted accordingly. This gave cameras equipped with this system the ability to adjust to changes in lighting during the actual exposure which was useful for specialist applications such as photomicrography and astronomical photography.

[[Leica Camera|Leica]] later used a variation of this system, as did [[Pentax]] with their '''Integrated Direct Metering''' ('''IDM''') in the [[Pentax LX|LX]] camera.
A variation of this "OTF" system was used on early Olympus E-Series digital cameras to fine-tune the exposure just before the first curtain was released; for this to work, the first curtain was coated in a neutral grey colour.

==Through the lens flash metering==
The process of calculating the correct amount of flash light can also be done 'through the lens'. This is being done in a significantly different way than non-flash 'through the lens' metering. The actual metering itself happens in two different ways, depending on the medium. Digital TTL works differently than analog TTL.

The analog version of TTL works as follows: when the incoming light hits the film, a part of it is reflected towards a sensor. This sensor controls the flash. If enough light is captured, the flash is stopped.&lt;ref name="mir" /&gt; During early testing of this system by Minolta and Olympus it was found that not all brands and types of film reflect the light to the same amount although the actual difference between brands was less than half a stop. The one exception was Polaroid's instant slide film which had a black surface and could not be used in TTL flash mode. Nevertheless, for most applications analogue TTL flash exposure metering was more advanced and accurate than systems used previously and permitted far more flexibility - with bounced flash exposures in particular being more accurate than manually calculated equivalents.

With digital, this way of direct reflection metering is not possible any more since a CMOS or CCD chip, used to collect the light, is not reflective enough. There are a few older digital cameras which still use the analog technique, but these are getting rare. The [[Fujifilm]] S1 and S3 are the most known to use this technique.

Digital TTL works as follows: Before the actual exposure one or more small flashes, called "preflashes", are emitted. The light returning through the lens is measured and this value is used to calculate the amount of light necessary for the actual exposure. Multiple pre-flashes can be used to improve the flash output. Canon refers to this technique as "E-TTL" and has later improved the system with "E-TTL II". The first form of digital TTL by Nikon, called "D-TTL", was used in a few early models. Since then, the superior "i-TTL" system has been used.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imaging-resource.com/ACCS/NIKONCLS/NIKONCLSA.HTM The Nikon Creative Lighting System: Wireless, Remote, Through-the-Lens Metered (iTTL) Flash!] Imaging Resource&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://photo.net/equipment/nikon/guide-to-ttl-flashes/ Guide to Nikon TTL Flashes] photo.net&lt;/ref&gt;

When using front-curtain flash (when the flash fires immediately after the shutter opens), the preflashes and main flash appear as one to the human eye, since there is very little time between them. When using rear-curtain flash (when the flash fires at the end of the exposure) and a slow shutter speed, the distinction between the main flash and the preflashes is more obvious.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://users.telenet.be/beertjesfotosite/Beertjessite/flitsen-voorflitsen.html|title=voorflitsen|author=|date=|website=users.telenet.be|accessdate=23 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some cameras and flash units take more information into account when calculating the necessary flash output, including the distance of the subject to the lens. This improves the lighting when a subject is placed in front of a background. If the lens is focused on the subject, the flash will be controlled to allow for proper exposure on the subject, thus leaving the background underexposed. Alternatively, if the lens is focused on the background, the background will be properly exposed, leaving the subject in the foreground typically overexposed. This technique requires both a camera capable of calculating the distance information, as well as the lens being capable of communicating the focal distance to the body. Nikon refers to this technique as "3D matrix metering", although different camera manufacturers use different terms for this technique. Canon incorporated this technique in E-TTL II.

More advanced TTL flash techniques include off-camera flash lighting, where one or more flash units are located at different locations around the subject. In this case a 'commander' unit (which can be integrated in the camera body) is used to control all of the remote units. The commander unit usually controls the remote flashes by using flashes of visible or infrared light, although TTL-capable radio triggering systems are available. The photographer can normally vary the light ratios between the different flashes. The technique of using preflashes to get a proper exposure is still used in automatic flash modes.

==History==
The first camera to feature through-the-lens light metering was by Japanese company [[Nikon]], with a prototype rangefinder camera, the SPX. The camera used Nikon 'S' type rangefinder lenses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.cameraquest.com/nrfstory.htm|title = Nikon Shibata Book|accessdate = 2008-06-08|last = Stephen|first = Gandy|work = Stephen Gandy's CameraQuest}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Japanese company [[Pentax]] was the first manufacturer to show an early prototype 35&amp;nbsp;mm behind-the-lens metering [[SLR camera]], which was named the [[Pentax Spotmatic]]. The camera was shown at the [[photokina 1960|1960 photokina]] show. The first TTL [[light meter]]ing SLR was the 1963 [[Topcon RE Super]], which had the CdS metering cell placed behind the reflex mirror.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20622">According to the [[Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore]] (CAAS), an [[unmanned aircraft]] (UA), commonly known as a drone, is operated without a pilot on board. An unmanned aircraft system (UAS) comprises the UA and associated elements such as the remote control equipment.&lt;ref name=caas-unmanned-aircraft-systems&gt;{{Cite web|title=Unmanned Aircraft Systems|url=https://www.caas.gov.sg/public-passengers/unmanned-aircraft-systems | website = www.caas.gov.sg | accessdate = 2018-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to Singapore’s busy airspace and densely populated urban environment, the UA must be operated safely and responsibly to avoid risks to aviation and public safety.&lt;ref name=caas-unmanned-aircraft-systems/&gt; The CAAS requires operators to understand and abide by regulations, including recreational or research uses of the UA.&lt;ref name=caas-unmanned-aircraft-systems/&gt; More information on the regulations can be found on Air Navigation Order, paragraph 80.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.caas.gov.sg/docs/default-source/pdf/air-navigation-order.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Regulations of Unmanned Aircraft==

===Unmanned Aircraft (Public Safety and Security) Bill===
The Unmanned Aircraft (Public Safety and Security) Act provides clear guidelines for the safe use of unmanned aircraft.&lt;ref name=drone-laws-in-singapore&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/drone-laws-in-singapore|title=Drone Laws in Singapore|date=19 April 2016|accessdate=26 March 2018|publisher=[[The Straits Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Laws were passed in Parliament in May 2015 to allay concerns over safety, security and privacy surrounding unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). The Unmanned Aircraft (Public Safety and Security) Bill outlines regulations for the safe flying of drones and enforcement action against errant users. For instance, permits are required to fly drones above 7&amp;nbsp;kg, or within a 5&amp;nbsp;km radius of an aerodrome.&lt;ref name=laws-governing-drones-should-be-reviewed-more-frequently-say-industry-players&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.todayonline.com/singapore/laws-governing-drones-should-be-reviewed-more-frequently-say-industry-players|title=High time for laws to catch up on drones: Experts|date=16 October 2016|accessdate=26 March 2018|publisher=[[Today Online]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before conducting any outdoor activities, operators should ensure that the UA is flown within the permitted areas. The CAAS website provides a map delineating prohibited areas, danger and restricted areas, areas within 5&amp;nbsp;km of an airport or an airbase and protected areas.&lt;ref name=caas-unmanned-aircraft-systems /&gt;

===Public Order Act===
In 2017, the [[Singapore National Day Parade]] was gazetted as a “special event” under the [[Public Order Act]]. The order, which was in effect for 24 hours on 9 August 2017, prohibited the unauthorised flying of unmanned aerial vehicles (AUV) such as drones in the area without a permit. The boundaries of the special event area included [[Marina Boulevard]], Victoria Street, Middle Road, Beach Road and the [[Marina Barrage]] carpark.&lt;ref name=ndp-gazetted-as-special-event&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/ndp-gazetted-as-special-event-stricter-security-measures-in-place-on-aug-9|title=Drone Laws in Singapore|date=2 August 2017|accessdate=25 March 2018|publisher=[[The Straits Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also an offence to fly a UAV outside of the special event area in a manner that “disrupts, interferes with, delays or obstructs” with the National Day Parade.&lt;ref name=police-media-release&gt;{{Cite web|title=Declaration Of National Day Parade 2017 As A Special Event|url=https://www.police.gov.sg/news-and-publications/media-releases/20170802_event_ndp2017_others | website = www.police.gov.sg | accessdate = 2018-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Offenders may be arrested and upon conviction, be liable to an imprisonment term for up to 12 months, a fine of up to $20,000, or to both. The UAV will be seized.&lt;ref name=police-media-release /&gt;

The 32nd Asean summit held at the Istana on 27 April 2018 and the Shangri-La Hotel on 28 April was declared an enhanced security special event under the Public Order Act by the [[Ministry of Home Affairs (Singapore)| Ministry of Home Affairs]].&lt;ref name=32ndaseansummit&gt;{{Cite web|title=Tighter security around Istana, Shangri-La Hotel during Asean summit on April 27-28|url=https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/tighter-security-around-istana-shangri-la-hotel-during-asean-summit-on-april-27-28?xtor=CS3-18| website = The Straits Times | accessdate = 2018-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is an offence to bring or fly drones in the area or outside of the area that disrupts, interferes with, delays or obstructs the conduct of the event.

===Personal Data Protection Act===
The Data Protection Provisions do not impose any obligation on an individual acting in his personal or domestic capacity.&lt;ref name=pdpa-guidelines&gt;{{Cite web|title=Advisory Guidelines|url=https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/-/media/Files/PDPC/PDF-Files/Advisory-Guidelines/finaladvisoryguidelinesonpdpaforselectedtopics28march2017.pdf | website = www.pdpc.gov.sg | accessdate = 2018-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Organisations will need to consider whether the drones they deploy are likely to capture personal data of individuals, and may wish to evaluate whether any exception under the [[Personal Data Protection Act]] (PDPA) applies in respect of its particular circumstances.&lt;ref name=pdpa-guidelines /&gt;

Organisations using UAs for photography, video or audio recording activities that capture personal data should refer to the Personal Data Protection Commission’s (PDPC) advisory guidelines.&lt;ref name=imda-uas&gt;{{Cite web|title=Operation of Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS)|url=https://www.imda.gov.sg/regulations-licensing-and-consultations/frameworks-and-policies/spectrum-management-and-coordination/frequency-allocation-and-assignment/operation-of-unmanned-aircraft-systems-uas | website = www.imda.gov.sg | accessdate = 2018-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among other obligations, the Data Protection Provisions require organisations to
inform individuals of the purposes for which their personal data will be collected, used and disclosed in order to obtain their consent.&lt;ref name=pdpa-guidelines /&gt; An organisation must therefore provide notification of the purposes for the collection, use or disclosure of personal data captured by its drones, in order to fulfil the obligation to obtain consent.&lt;ref name=pdpa-guidelines /&gt; The notifications should specify if photography, video and/or audio recording is occurring and should generally be placed so as to enable individuals to have sufficient awareness that drones are in operation in the general locale. For example, it may be appropriate to place a notice at points of entry to the area of operation, where individuals are able to read the notice prior to entry.&lt;ref name=pdpa-guidelines /&gt;

===Telecommunications Act===
Users with UAs that contain short range devices that conform to the approved operating radio frequencies and corresponding power limits will be exempted from [[Info-communications Media Development Authority]]'s (IMDA) licensing requirements.&lt;ref name=imda-uas /&gt; For UAs with radio frequencies or power limits that are not in the IMDA’s guidelines, equipment dealers have to apply for the relevant license and register their equipment with the IMDA.&lt;ref name=imda-uas /&gt; Under the Telecommunications (Dealers) Regulations, an equipment dealer may only sell IMDA-registered telecommunication equipment for use in Singapore.&lt;ref name=imda-uas /&gt;

==Types of UA Usage==
In general, permits are not required for recreational or research uses of UA in Singapore, as long as the operation of the UA is in line with CAAS’ operating conditions.

Situations where recreational or research uses of UA require a permit is where:
* The total mass of UA including payload exceeds 7&amp;nbsp;kg (Operator permit and Class 1 Activity Permit required)
* UA is flown higher than 200 feet above mean sea level (Class 2 Activity Permit required)
* Within restricted, danger, protected, prohibited areas and within 5&amp;nbsp;km of an aerodrome / airbase (Class 2 Activity Permit required)&lt;ref name=caas-unmanned-aircraft-systems /&gt;

===Recreational Uses===
CAAS defines recreational activities as “any pursuit or activity engaged in for enjoyment, relaxation or leisure”.

Activities that are not considered recreational uses include:

*A sporting activity that forms part of an organised group activity or organised competition or tournament (such as a flying display); 
*A recreational activity provided by a business, or in the course of business.&lt;ref name=caas-unmanned-aircraft-systems /&gt;

===Research Uses===
According to CAAS, any activity falling within the following categories are considered research in nature: 
*Any lecture, tutorial, seminar, demonstration, class or similar activity on unmanned aircraft provided by an educational institution, referred to in section 72 of the Private Education Act; or
* Any research and development activity carried on by an educational institution, referred to in section 72 of the Private Education Act, with the object of acquiring knowledge that may be of use for the purpose of devising or developing a new or substantially improved product that is an unmanned aircraft.&lt;ref name=caas-unmanned-aircraft-systems /&gt;

===Other Uses===
Regardless of UA weight or location of UA operations, an operator permit and Class 1 Activity Permit is required for operations that are non-recreational or non-research in nature.

Examples of applicable uses include:
*Business providing aerial surveying or photography services
*Company's public communications department using an UA to take event photographs for its own internal newsletter
*Competitive UA races by a private organiser
*Training courses with a practical element, that is, a UA is deployed as part of the course syllabus&lt;ref name=caas-unmanned-aircraft-systems /&gt;

==UA Permits==
===Operator Permit===
CAAS grants an operator permit to an applicant who is able to ensure safe operation of UA, taking into account the applicant’s organisational set-up, competency of the personnel especially those flying the UA, procedures to manage safety including the conduct of safety risk assessments, and the airworthiness of each of the aircraft. The permit is valid for up to one year.&lt;ref name=caas-unmanned-aircraft-systems /&gt;

===Activity Permit===
An activity permit is granted by CAAS to an applicant for a single activity or a block of repeated activities to be carried out by a UA at a specific area of operation, and which are of specific operational profiles and conditions.

A Class 1 Activity permit is required for purposes that are not recreational or research in nature; or if the UA used is over 7&amp;nbsp;kg in total mass (including payload). A Class 1 Activity Permit is not valid without a UA Operator Permit.

A Class 2 Activity permit is required for UA activities for recreational or research purposes, and which meets any of these conditions:
* Operating altitude higher than 200&amp;nbsp;ft (approx. 60m) above mean sea level (AMSL);
* Within 5&amp;nbsp;kg of a civil/military aerodrome; or
* Within any Restricted Area, Danger Area or Protected Area

== Issues Surrounding UAs ==

===Accidents involving UAs===
Before the Act was introduced in 2015, then Transport Minister [[Lui Tuck Yew]] said in Parliament that there had been more than 20 reported incidents involving drones between April 2014 and May 2015, two of which involved the drones falling onto MRT tracks.&lt;ref name=laws-governing-drones-should-be-reviewed-more-frequently-say-industry-players /&gt;

In 2016, the [[Singapore government]] received a report of a remote control aeroplane that damaged the roof of a housing block in [[Bishan, Singapore|Bishan]]. However, the operator had yet to be located, according to Transport Minister [[Khaw Boon Wan]] in a written parliamentary response.&lt;ref name=laws-governing-drones-should-be-reviewed-more-frequently-say-industry-players /&gt;

===Breaches of regulations===
In 2015, a 27-year-old man who flew a drone at the War Memorial Park on National Day was given a stern warning by the police. He was believed to have been trying to take photographs of the NDP fireworks.&lt;ref name=ndp-gazetted-as-special-event /&gt;

Between June 2015 and May 2017, the CAAS recorded 103 violations.&lt;ref name=spore-joins-global-panel-to-regulate-drone-use&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/spore-joins-global-panel-to-regulate-drone-use|title=Singapore joins global panel to regulate drone use|date=22 May 2017|accessdate=26 March 2018|publisher=[[The Straits Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mr Tan Kah Han, senior director for safety regulation and director for airworthiness and flight operations at the CAAS, said that such incidents typically involve flying within 5&amp;nbsp;km of aerodromes, which is not allowed, and flying within restricted and security-sensitive areas without a permit.&lt;ref name=spore-joins-global-panel-to-regulate-drone-use /&gt;

In 2017, there were 12 breaches involving UAs during the National Education and preview shows according to a police statement.&lt;ref name=ndp-gazetted-as-special-event /&gt;

On 9 August 2017, a 53-year-old man was arrested on National Day for flying a drone at Marina Barrage, which was marked within the Special Events Area. Unauthorised flying of unmanned aerial vehicles is not allowed for 24 hours on National Day.&lt;ref name=53-year-old-man-arrested&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/53-year-old-man-arrested-for-flying-drone-at-marina-barrage-on-national-day|title=53-year-old man arrested for flying drone at Marina Barrage on national day|date=9 August 2017|accessdate=26 March 2018|publisher=[[The Straits Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Opinions by industry players===
Experts highlight the risks of increasingly sophisticated drone technology being "accessible to the man on the street at brick-and-mortar shops or online", such as high-definition video capabilities making it easier for surveillance to be carried out covertly.&lt;ref name=laws-governing-drones-should-be-reviewed-more-frequently-say-industry-players /&gt;

In 2015, The [[Workers' Party (Singapore)|Workers' Party]]’s [[Gerald Giam]], a [[Non-Constituency Member of Parliament]], proposed fitting drones above a certain weight and size with geo-fencing capabilities, to prevent them from entering prohibited spaces.&lt;ref name=laws-governing-drones-should-be-reviewed-more-frequently-say-industry-players /&gt; Government Parliamentary Committee (Home Affairs and Law) member [[Desmond Choo]] felt that it was important to conduct education campaigns to educate both users and companies that bring in drones.&lt;ref name=laws-governing-drones-should-be-reviewed-more-frequently-say-industry-players /&gt;

Dr Foong Shaohui, a [[Singapore University of Technology and Design]] assistant professor with an interest in robotics and unmanned systems, highlighted how without proper training, even a drone weighing just 1 kilograms can cause property damage and serious injuries.”&lt;ref name=laws-governing-drones-should-be-reviewed-more-frequently-say-industry-players /&gt;

Mr Mohamed Faisal Mohamed Salleh, deputy director of [[Nanyang Technology University]]'s Air Traffic Management Research Institute, said that it can be "almost impossible" to find the pilot after UA-related accidents. To counter this issue, he suggested the use of aircraft surveillance technology to trace the positions of all UAs, which could potentially involve the use of telco or wireless networks, or by creating an "Electronic Road Pricing system in the sky".&lt;ref name=laws-governing-drones-should-be-reviewed-more-frequently-say-industry-players /&gt;

While Mr Yue Keng Mun, from [[Temasek Polytechnic]]'s School of Engineering, proposed having indoor or fenced-up outdoor spaces for operators to practice their flying skills, Mr Khaw responded in his parliamentary reply that "promoting shared used of space in land-scarce Singapore was preferable to setting aside special flying parks."&lt;ref name=laws-governing-drones-should-be-reviewed-more-frequently-say-industry-players /&gt;

According to an article by [[The Straits Times]] in January 2018, more private condominiums are banning the use of drones within their estates, citing concerns over privacy and safety.&lt;ref name=condos-not-seeing-buzz&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/housing/condos-not-seeing-the-buzz-in-drones|title=Condos not seeing the buzz in drones|date=20 January 2018|accessdate=26 March 2018|publisher=[[The Straits Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Developments in UA regulations and initiatives==
In 2017, Singapore joined the Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) Advisory Group, a 15-member group set up by the United Nations’ civil aviation arm to draw up global rules and regulations for the safe use of UAs.&lt;ref name=spore-joins-global-panel-to-regulate-drone-use /&gt;

In 2018, [[one-north]] was designated as Singapore’s first drone estate, to provide companies and research institutions with an urban environment for test-bedding innovative unmanned aircraft systems.&lt;ref name=one-north-to-be-designated&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/transport/one-north-to-be-designated-as-singapores-first-drone-estate|title=One-north to be designated as Singapore's first drone estate|date=5 February 2018|accessdate=23 March 2018|publisher=[[The Straits Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the drone estate initiative, approved operators and research users can carry out their trials and operations at one-north without compromising safety and security.&lt;ref name=five-projects-to-kick-off&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/transport/five-projects-to-kick-off-unmanned-aircraft-system-trials-at-singapores-first|title=Five projects to kick off unmanned aircraft system trials at Singapore's first drone estate|date=7 February 2018|accessdate=23 March 2018|publisher=[[The Straits Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Singapore Armed Forces]] have invested in new technologies such as drones that can home in and catch errant drones. Counter-drone systems are among the features of smart airbases of the future.&lt;ref name=SAF-announces-plans&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/saf-announces-plans-to-tap-tech-consolidate-bmt|title=SAF announces plans to tap tech, consolidate BMT|date=3 March 2018|accessdate=24 March 2018|publisher=[[The Straits Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Women's Trade Union League''' ('''WTUL''') was a [[United States|U.S.]] organization of both working class and more well-off women formed in 1903 to support the efforts of women to organize [[labor unions]] and to eliminate [[sweatshop]] conditions. The WTUL played an important role in supporting the massive strikes in the first two decades of the twentieth century that established the [[International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union]] and [[Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America]] and in campaigning for [[women's suffrage]] among men and women workers.

==Origins==

The roots of the WTUL come from [[Women's Trade Union League (United Kingdom)|a British organization of the same name]] founded thirty years earlier. The British League had originally supported the creation of a separate women's labor movement but, by the 1890s, merged its own aims with the mainstream British labor movement and functioned as an umbrella organization of women's trade unions. Its first American supporter was the socialist [[William English Walling]] who met with British WTUL leaders in 1902. He returned to the United States and began to generate support for a similar American organization.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}

Organized in 1903 at the [[American Federation of Labor]] convention, the WTUL spent much of its early years trying to cultivate ties with the AFL leadership. Its first president was [[Mary Morton Kehew]], a labor and social reformer from Boston.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Commire|editor1-first=Anne|editorlink=Anne Commire|chapter=Kehew, Mary Morton (1859–1918)|title=Women in World History: A Biographical Encyclopedia|publisher=Yorkin Publications, Gale Group|location=Waterford, CT|date=1999|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G2-2591304863.html|isbn=0787640808|website=HighBeam Research|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By 1907, the WTUL saw its purpose as supporting the AFL and encouraging women's membership in the organization. In its constitution that year, the WTUL defined its purpose in assisting "in organizing women into trade unions...such unions to be affiliated, where practicable, with the American Federation of Labor."  In response, the AFL leadership generally ignored the League. When the WTUL decided to hold its annual conference at a different location than the AFL in 1905, [[Samuel Gompers]] was furious and refused to attend.  Still, the League did push the AFL towards a pro-[[Women's suffrage|suffrage]] position and did manage to organize more women into the Federation than at any previous time.

It also drew on the earlier work of activists in the [[Settlement movement|settlement house movement]], such as [[Jane Addams]] and [[Florence Kelley]], and budding unions in industries with a large number of women workers, such as garments and textiles. The WTUL leadership comprised both upper-class philanthropists and working-class women with experience organizing unions, including a significant portion of the most important female labor leaders of the day, including [[Mary Kenney O'Sullivan]] and [[Rose Schneiderman]].

But the heyday of the League came between 1907 and 1922 under the presidency of [[Margaret Dreier Robins]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Womens-Trade-Union-League|title=Women's Trade Union League (WTUL) {{!}} American organization|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2017-08-24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; During that period, the WTUL led the drive to organize women workers into unions, secured protective legislation, and educated the public on the problems and needs of working women.&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Anne Payne, ''Reform, Labor, and Feminism: Margaret Dreier Robins and the Women's Trade Union League.'' Chicago: University of Illinois Press, 1988; pp. 1-3. See also: Robin Miller Jacoby, ''The British and American Women's Trade Union Leagues, 1890-1925.'' New York: Carlson Publishing, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Support for union organizing==
[[Image:1908-WTUL-laborday.jpg|thumb|right|400px|WTUL float, Labor Day parade, New York, 1908]]

The League supported a number of strikes in the first few years of its existence, including the 1907 telegrapher's strike organized by the [[Commercial Telegraphers Union of America]]. The WTUL played a critical role in supporting the [[New York shirtwaist strike of 1909|Uprising of the 20,000]], the [[New York City]] and [[Philadelphia]] shirtwaist workers' strike, by providing a headquarters for the strike, raising money for relief funds, soup kitchens and bail for picketers, providing witnesses and legal defense for arrested picketers, joining the strikers on the picket line, and organizing mass meetings and marches to publicize the shirtwaist workers' demands and the sweatshop conditions they were fighting. Some observers made light of the upper-class women members of the WTUL who picketed alongside garment workers, calling them the "[[mink brigade]]". These distinctions split strikers from their upper-class benefactors as well: a contingent of strikers challenged [[Alva Belmont]] concerning her reasons for supporting the strike.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}

The strike was, however, less than wholly successful: [[Italy|Italian]] workers crossed the picket lines in large numbers and the strikers lacked the resources to hold out longer than the employers. In addition, although activists within the WTUL, including [[William English Walling|William E. Walling]] and [[Lillian D. Wald]], were also among the founders of the [[NAACP]] that year and fought the employers' plan to use [[African-American]] strikebreakers to defeat the strike, others in the black community actively encouraged black workers to cross the picket lines. Even so, the strike produced some limited gains for workers, while giving both the WTUL and women garment workers a practical education in organizing.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}

[[File:1st International Congress of Working Women called by the National Womens' Trade Union League of America, Washington, D.C., October 28, 1919 LCCN2007661733.tif|thumb|right|400px|1st International Congress of Working Women called by the National Women's Trade Union League of America, Washington, D.C., October 28, 1919]]

The WTUL played a similar role in the strike of mostly male cloakmakers in New York City and men clothing workers in [[Chicago]] in 1910, in the 1911 garment workers strike in [[Cleveland]] and in many other actions in Iowa, Massachusetts, Missouri and Wisconsin. By 1912, however, the WTUL began to distance itself from the labor movement, supporting strike action selectively when it approved of the leadership's strategy and criticizing the male-dominated leadership of the ILGWU that it saw as unrepresentative of women workers. The WTUL's semi-official relationship with the [[American Federation of Labor]] was also strained when the [[United Textile Workers]], an AFL affiliate, insisted that it stop providing relief for [[Lawrence, Massachusetts]] textile workers who refused to return to work during the [[Lawrence textile strike|strike]] led by the [[Industrial Workers of the World]]; some WTUL leaders complied, while others refused, denouncing both the AFL and the WTUL for its acquiescence in strikebreaking activities.

The League had a closer relationship with the Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America, the union formed by the most militant locals of mostly immigrant workers in the men's [[clothing industry]] in Chicago, New York and other eastern urban centers, which was outside the AFL. The WTUL trained women as labor leaders and organizers at its school founded in Chicago in 1914 and played a key role in bringing Italian garment workers into the union in New York.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}

==Support for legislative reforms==

At this time the WTUL also began to work for legislative reforms, in particular the [[eight-hour day]], the minimum wage and protective legislation. Because of the hostility of the [[United States Supreme Court]] toward economic legislation at the time, only legislation that singled out women and children for special protections survived challenges to its constitutionality. Ironically, [[Samuel Gompers]] and the conservative leadership of the AFL also viewed such legislation with hostility, but for a different reason: they believed by that point that legislation of this sort interfered with [[collective bargaining]], both by usurping the role of unions in obtaining better wages and working conditions and in setting a precedent for governmental intrusion into the area.

The WTUL was also active in demanding safe working conditions, both before and after the [[Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire]] in 1911 in which 146 workers were killed. That fire, which had been preceded by a similar fire in [[Newark, New Jersey]] in which twenty-five garment workers were killed, not only galvanized public opinion on the subject, but also exposed the fissures between the League's well-heeled supporters and its working class militants, such as [[Rose Schneiderman]]. As Schneiderman said in her speech at the memorial meeting held in the Metropolitan Opera House on April 2, 1911:

:I would be a traitor to these poor burned bodies if I came here to talk good fellowship. We have tried you good people of the public and we have found you wanting. The old Inquisition had its rack and its thumbscrews and its instruments of torture with iron teeth. We know what these things are today; the iron teeth are our necessities, the thumbscrews are the high-powered and swift machinery close to which we must work, and the rack is here in the firetrap structures that will destroy us the minute they catch on fire.

:This is not the first time girls have been burned alive in the city. Every week I must learn of the untimely death of one of my sister workers. Every year thousands of us are maimed. The life of men and women is so cheap and property is so sacred. There are so many of us for one job it matters little if 146 of us are burned to death.

:We have tried you citizens; we are trying you now, and you have a couple of dollars for the sorrowing mothers, brothers and sisters by way of a charity gift. But every time the workers come out in the only way they know to protest against conditions which are unbearable the strong hand of the law is allowed to press down heavily upon us.

:Public officials have only words of warning to us&amp;nbsp;– warning that we must be intensely peaceable, and they have the workhouse just back of all their warnings. The strong hand of the law beats us back, when we rise, into the conditions that make life unbearable.

:I can't talk fellowship to you who are gathered here. Too much blood has been spilled. I know from my experience it is up to the working people to save themselves. The only way they can save themselves is by a strong working-class movement.

The WTUL also began to work actively for women's suffrage, in close coalition with the [[National American Woman Suffrage Association]], in the years before passage of the [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] in 1920. The WTUL saw suffrage as a way to gain protective legislation for women and to provide them with the dignity and other less tangible benefits that followed from political equality. Schneiderman coined an evocative phrase in campaigning for suffrage in 1912:

:What the woman who labors wants is the right to live, not simply exist&amp;nbsp;— the right to life as the rich woman has the right to life, and the sun and music and art. You have nothing that the humblest worker has not a right to have also. The worker must have bread, but she must have roses, too. Help, you women of privilege, give her the ballot to fight with.

Her phrase "bread and roses", recast as "We want bread and roses too", became the slogan of the largely immigrant, largely women workers of the [[1912 Lawrence textile strike]].

The WTUL was, on the other hand, mistrustful of the [[National Woman's Party]], with its more individualistic, rights-oriented approach to woman's equality. The WTUL was strongly opposed to the [[Equal Rights Amendment]] drafted by the NWP after the passage of the Nineteenth Amendment on the ground that it would undo the protective legislation that the WTUL had fought so hard to obtain.

The WTUL focused increasingly on legislation in the 1920s and thereafter. Its leadership, in particular Schneiderman, were supporters of the [[New Deal]] and had a particularly close connection to the [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt|Roosevelt]] administration through [[Eleanor Roosevelt]], a member of the WTUL since 1923. The WTUL dissolved in 1950.

A related organization was the Women's Education and Industrial Union (WEIU), which employed female researchers such as [[Louise Marion Bosworth]] to research the working conditions of women.
