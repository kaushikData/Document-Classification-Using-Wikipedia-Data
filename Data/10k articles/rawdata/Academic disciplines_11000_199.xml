      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6929">The '''Aconcagua mummy''' is an Incan ''[[capacocha]]'' mummy of a seven-year-old boy, dated to around 500 [[Before Present|BP]].{{sfn|Gómez-Carballa|Catelli|2015}} The mummy is well-preserved, due to the extreme cold and dry conditions of its high altitude burial location.{{sfn|Wade|2015}} The frozen mummy was discovered by hikers in 1985 at {{convert|5300|m|abbr = on}} on [[Aconcagua]] in [[Mendoza, Argentina]].{{sfn|Gómez-Carballa|Catelli|2015}}{{sfn|Wade|2015}}

==Discovery==
The Aconcagua mummy was buried inside a semicircular stone structure{{sfn|Ceruti|2015}} and found covered in vomit, red pigment, and fecal remains.{{sfn|Faux|2012}} The body was wrapped in textiles in a style derived from central coastal Peru.{{sfn|Cassman|2007|p=144}} Six statuettes were also found buried with the body.{{sfn|Gómez-Carballa|Catelli|2015}}

An analysis shows that the boy's diet consisted primarily of maize, quinoa, capsicum, potatoes, and terrestrial meat. A year and a half before his death, his diet became more marine-based.{{sfn|Faux|2012}} The presence of [[achiote]] was also found inside his stomach and colon.{{sfn|Cassman|2007|p=144}}

==Archaeogenetics==
In 2015, DNA was extracted from a {{convert|350|mg|abbr = on}} sample from one of his lungs.{{sfn|Gómez-Carballa|Catelli|2015}} His mtDNA lineage belongs to a subgroup of [[Haplogroup C (mtDNA)|Haplogroup C1b]], the previously unidentified C1bi (''i'' for Inca).{{sfn|Gómez-Carballa|Catelli|2015}} His mtDNA lineage contains 10 distinct mutations from C1b.{{sfn|Gómez-Carballa|Catelli|2015}} The researchers determined that Haplogroup C1bi likely arose around 14,300 years ago.{{sfn|Gómez-Carballa|Catelli|2015}} An individual from the [[Wari Empire]] was found to be a match for this previously unidentified haplogroup.{{sfn|Gómez-Carballa|Catelli|2015}}{{sfn|Wade|2015}} In 2018, researchers sequenced the [[genome]] of the Aconcagua mummy from a {{convert|100|mg|abbr = on}} sample from one of his lungs.{{sfn|Moreno-Mayar|Vinner|de Barros Damgaard|de la Fuente|2018|p=12 (Supplementary)}} His Y-DNA lineage belongs to [[Haplogroup Q-M3]].{{sfn|Salas|Catelli|Pardo-Seco|Gómez-Carballa|2018}} His specific Y-DNA haplogroup is closest matched by the Choppca people from [[Huancavelica]], a [[Quechua people|Quechua speaking population]], and clusters closer to modern Quechua speaking peoples than [[Aymara people|Aymara speaking peoples]].{{sfn|Salas|Catelli|Pardo-Seco|Gómez-Carballa|2018}} Overall, the genome of the Aconcagua mummy clusters with modern Andean populations.{{sfn|Moreno-Mayar|Vinner|de Barros Damgaard|de la Fuente|2018|p=21 (Supplementary)}}

}}

'''Alfred Mann''' (April 28, 1917 – September 21, 2006), was a writer in [[musical theory]] and Professor of [[Musicology]]&lt;ref name="bio" /&gt; at the [[Eastman School of Music]], [[University of Rochester]].

==Biography==

Alfred Mann left Germany before [[World War II]] and moved to Italy where he only could stay shortly. In 1938, Mann had to leave Italy, because of a [[Benito Mussolini|Mussolini]] mandate, and Mann moved to the USA. After a long career, Mann became Professor of Musicology at the Eastman School in 1980, retiring and becoming [[Professor Emeritus]] in 1987.

==Important Writings==

In 1943, Mann made the first translation&lt;ref name="gradus" /&gt; of [[Johann Joseph Fux]]'s ''[[Gradus ad Parnassum]]'' into English. The translation contained the preface, pages 41 – 139 and page 279 of the original work.

In 1958, Mann translated&lt;ref name="fugue1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="fugue2" /&gt; into English, the part of ''Gradus ad Parnassum'' that concerned the composition of a [[fugue]], pages 140 – 217 of the original work.

'''Amusia''' is a [[music-specific disorders|musical disorder]] that appears mainly as a defect in processing [[pitch (music)|pitch]] but also encompasses musical memory and recognition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Pearce J. M. S. | year = 2005 | title = Selected observations on amusia." [Article] | url = | journal = European Neurology | volume = 54 | issue = 3| pages = 145–48 | doi=10.1159/000089606}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two main classifications of amusia exist: acquired amusia, which occurs as a result of [[brain damage]], and congenital amusia, which results from a music-processing anomaly present since birth.

Studies have shown that congenital amusia is a deficit in fine-grained pitch discrimination and that 4% of the population suffers from this disorder.&lt;ref name=Insights&gt;{{cite journal | author = Peretz I., Hyde K. L. | year = 2003 | title = What is specific to music processing? Insights from congenital amusia." [Review] | url = | journal = Trends in Cognitive Sciences | volume = 7 | issue = 8| pages = 362–67 | doi=10.1016/s1364-6613(03)00150-5 | pmid=12907232}}&lt;/ref&gt; Acquired amusia, on the other hand, may take several forms. Patients with brain damage may experience the loss of ability to produce musical sounds while sparing [[speech]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Peretz I., Zatorre R. | year = 2005 | title =  Brain Organization for Music Processing| url = | journal = Annual Review of Psychology | volume = 56 | issue = | pages = 89–114 | doi=10.1146/annurev.psych.56.091103.070225| pmid = 15709930 }}&lt;/ref&gt; much like [[aphasia|aphasics]] lose speech selectively but can sometimes still [[singing|sing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Hébert S., Racette A., Gagnon L., Peretz I. | year = 2003 | title = Revisiting the dissociation between singing and speaking in expressive aphasia | url = http://www.brams.umontreal.ca/plab/publications/articles | journal = Brain | volume = 126 | issue = 8 | pages = 1838–50 | doi = 10.1093/brain/awg186 | pmid = 12821526 | access-date = 17 June 2009 | archive-url = https://archive.is/20120721222425/http://www.brams.umontreal.ca/plab/publications/articles | archive-date = 21 July 2012 | dead-url = yes | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dorgueille, C. 1966. Introduction à l'étude des amusies.
Unpublished doctoral dissertation, Université de la Sorbonne, Paris.&lt;/ref&gt; Other forms of amusia may affect specific sub-processes of music processing. Current research has demonstrated [[dissociation (neuropsychology)|dissociations]] between [[rhythm]], [[melody]], and emotional processing of music,&lt;ref&gt;Sacks, Oliver. (2007). ''Musicophilia'', New York: Random House. pp. 3–17, 187–258, 302–03.&lt;/ref&gt; and amusia may include impairment of any combination of these skill sets.

==Basics of music processing==
Neurologically intact individuals appear to be born musical. Even before they are able to talk, infants show remarkable musical abilities that are similar to those of adults in that they are sensitive to [[musical scale]]s and a regular [[tempo]].&lt;ref name=Insights/&gt; Also, infants are able to differentiate between [[Consonance and dissonance|consonant and dissonant]] intervals. These perceptual skills indicate that music-specific predispositions exist.&lt;ref name=Insights/&gt;

Prolonged exposure to music develops and refines these skills. Extensive musical training does not seem to be necessary in the processing of [[Chord (music)|chords]] and [[key (music)|keys]].&lt;ref name=Insights/&gt; The development of musical competence most likely depends on the encoding of pitch along musical scales and maintaining a regular [[pulse (music)|pulse]], both of which are key components in the structure of music and aid in perception, memory, and performance.&lt;ref name=Insights/&gt; Also, the encoding of pitch and temporal regularity are both likely to be specialized for music processing.&lt;ref name=Insights/&gt; Pitch perception is absolutely crucial to processing music. The use of scales and the organization of scale tones around a central tone (called the [[Tonic (music)|tonic]]) assign particular importance to notes in the scale and cause non-scale notes to sound out of place. This enables the listener to ascertain when a wrong note is played. However, in individuals with amusia, this ability is either compromised or lost entirely.&lt;ref name=Insights/&gt;

Music-specific neural networks exist in the brain for a variety of music-related tasks. It has been shown that [[Broca's area]] is involved in the processing of musical syntax.&lt;ref&gt;Burkhard Maess, Stefan Koelsch, Thomas C. Gunter and Angela D. Friederici. "Musical syntax is processed in Broca’s area: an MEG study" (2001) ''Nature Publishing Group''.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, brain damage can disrupt an individual's ability to tell the difference between [[tonality|tonal]] and [[atonality|atonal]] music and detect the presence of wrong notes, but can preserve the individual's ability to assess the distance between pitches and the direction of the pitch.&lt;ref name=Insights/&gt; The opposite scenario can also occur, in which the individual loses pitch discrimination capabilities, but can sense and appreciate the tonal context of the work. Distinct neural networks also exist for music memories, singing, and music recognition. Neural networks for music recognition are particularly intriguing. A patient can undergo brain damage that renders them unable to recognize familiar melodies that are presented without words. However, the patient maintains the ability to recognize spoken lyrics or words, familiar voices, and environmental sounds.&lt;ref name=Insights/&gt; The reverse case is also possible, in which the patient cannot recognize spoken words, but can still recognize familiar melodies. These situations overturn previous claims that speech recognition and music recognition share a single processing system.&lt;ref name=Insights/&gt; Instead, it is clear that there are at least two distinct processing modules: one for speech and one for music.&lt;ref name=Insights/&gt;

==Symptoms==
Symptoms of amusia are generally categorized as receptive, clinical, or mixed. Symptoms of receptive amusia, sometimes referred to as "musical deafness", include the inability to recognize familiar [[melodies]], the loss of ability to read [[musical notation]], and the inability to detect wrong or out-of tune notes.&lt;ref name=Neuroanatomy&gt;http://amusia-brain.blogspot.com/2008/02/definition_25.html Hutchings, Tiffany, Seth Hayden, Mandy Politziner, and Erina Kainuma. "Amusia." Web log post. Amusia: Definition, Welcome to Amusia..., Congenital and Acquired Amusia, Neural Overview. 25 Feb. 2008. Web. 10 Oct. 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Clinical, or expressive, symptoms include the loss of ability to sing, write [[musical notation]], and/or play an instrument.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Bautista R., Ciampetti M. | year = 2003 | title = Expressive Aprosody and Amusia as a Manifestation of Right Hemisphere Seizures | url = | journal = Epilepsia | volume = 44 | issue = 3| pages = 466–67 | doi=10.1046/j.1528-1157.2003.36502.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; A mixed disorder would be a combination of expressive and receptive impairment.

Clinical symptoms of acquired amusia are much more variable than those of congenital amusia and are determined by the location and nature of the lesion.&lt;ref name=Neuroanatomy/&gt; Brain injuries may afflict motor or expressive functioning, including the ability to sing, whistle, or hum a tune (oral-expressive amusia), the ability to play an instrument (instrumental amusia or musical apraxia), and the ability to write music (musical agraphia). Additionally, brain damage to the receptive dimension affects the faculty to discriminate tunes (receptive or sensorial amusia), the ability to read music (musical alessia), and the ability to identify songs that were familiar prior to the brain damage (amnesic amusia).

Research suggests that patients with amusia also have difficulty when it comes to spatial processing.&lt;ref name=nature&gt;{{cite journal | author = Douglas K. M., Bilkey D.K. | year = 2007 | title = Amusia is Associated with Deficits in Spatial Processing | url = | journal = Nature Neuroscience | volume = 10 | issue = 7| pages = 915–21 | doi=10.1038/nn1925}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amusics performed more quickly than normal individuals on a combined task of both spatial and musical processing tasks, which is most likely due to their deficit. Normal individuals experience interference due to their intact processing of both musical and spatial tasks, while amusics do not.&lt;ref name=nature/&gt; Pitch processing normally depends on the cognitive mechanisms that are usually used to process spatial representations.&lt;ref name=nature/&gt;

Those with congenital amusia show impaired performance on discrimination, identification and imitation of sentences with [[Intonation (linguistics)|intonational]] differences in pitch direction in their final word.

==Classifications==
There are two general classifications of amusia: congenital amusia and acquired amusia.

===Congenital amusia===
'''Congenital amusia''', commonly known as '''tone deafness''',&lt;ref name=Family/&gt; refers to a musical disability that cannot be explained by prior brain lesion, hearing loss, cognitive defects, or lack of environmental stimulation,&lt;ref name="Fine-grained"/&gt; and it affects about 4% of the population.&lt;ref name=Insights/&gt; Individuals who suffer from congenital amusia seem to lack the musical predispositions with which most people are born.&lt;ref name=Time&gt;{{cite journal | author = Hyde K. L., Peretz I. | year = 2004 | title = Brains that are out of tune but in time." [Article] | url = | journal = Psychological Science | volume = 15 | issue = 5| pages = 356–60 | doi=10.1111/j.0956-7976.2004.00683.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are unable to recognize or hum familiar tunes even if they have normal [[audiometry]] and above-average intellectual and memory skills. Also, they do not show sensitivity to dissonant chords in a melodic context, which, as discussed earlier, is one of the musical predispositions exhibited by infants. The hallmark of congenital amusia is a deficit in fine-grained pitch discrimination, and this deficit is most apparent when congenital amusics are asked to pick out a wrong note in a given melody.&lt;ref name=Insights/&gt; If the distance between two successive pitches is small, congenital amusics are not able to detect a pitch change. As a result of this defect in pitch perception, a lifelong musical impairment may emerge due to a failure to internalize musical scales. A lack of fine-grained pitch discrimination makes it extremely difficult for amusics to enjoy and appreciate music, which consists largely of small pitch changes.&lt;ref name=Time/&gt;

Tone-deaf people seem to be disabled only when it comes to music as they can fully interpret the [[Prosody (linguistics)|prosody]] or [[Intonation (linguistics)|intonation]] of human speech.  Tone deafness has a strong negative [[correlation]] with belonging to societies with [[tonal language]]s.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}} This could be evidence that the ability to reproduce and distinguish between notes may be a learned skill; conversely, it may suggest that the genetic predisposition towards accurate pitch discrimination may influence the linguistic development of a population towards tonality. A correlation between [[allele frequencies]] and linguistic typological features has been recently discovered, supporting the latter hypothesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dediu |first=Dan |author2=D. Robert Ladd |title=Linguistic tone is related to the population frequency of the adaptive haplogroups of two brain size genes, ASPM and Microcephalin |journal=[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences]] |volume=104 |issue=26 |pages=10944–49 |date=June 2007 |pmid=17537923 |pmc=1904158 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0610848104 |url=http://www.pnas.org/content/104/26/10944 |accessdate=18 July 2008|bibcode=2007PNAS..10410944D }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tone deafness is also associated with other musical-specific impairments such as the inability to keep time with music ([[beat deafness]], or the lack of [[rhythm]]), or the inability to remember or recognize a song. These disabilities can appear separately, but some research shows that they are more likely to appear in tone-deaf people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first=Julie |last=Ayotte |author2=Isabelle Peretz |author3=Krista Hyde |title=Congenital amusia: a group study of adults afflicted with a music-specific disorder |journal=[[Brain (journal)|Brain]] |volume=125 |issue=2 |pages=238–51 |date=February 2002 |pmid=11844725 |doi=10.1093/brain/awf028 |url=http://brain.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/125/2/238 |accessdate=18 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Experienced musicians, such as [[W.

A. |title=Tone-Deaf Choir |url=http://ListeningBookAudio.com/tonedeaf.htm |accessdate=26 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Acquired amusia===
'''Acquired amusia''' is a musical disability that shares the same characteristics as congenital amusia, but rather than being inherited, it is the result of brain damage.&lt;ref name= Stroke&gt;{{cite journal | author = Sarkamo T., Tervaniemi M., Soinila S., Autti T., Silvennoinen H. M., Laine M. ''et al.'' | year = 2009 | title = Cognitive deficits associated with acquired amusia after stroke: A neuropsychological follow-up study." [Article] | url = | journal = Neuropsychologia | volume = 47 | issue = 12| pages = 2642–2651 | doi=10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2009.05.015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also more common than congenital amusia.&lt;ref name=Stroke/&gt; While it has been suggested that music is processed by music-specific neural networks in the brain, this view has been broadened to show that music processing also encompasses generic cognitive functions, such as memory, attention, and executive processes.&lt;ref name=Stroke/&gt; A recent study was conducted to investigate the neural and cognitive mechanisms that underlie acquired amusia and contribute to its recovery.&lt;ref name=Stroke/&gt; The study was performed on 53 stroke patients with a left or right hemisphere [[middle cerebral artery]] (MCA) infarction one week, three months, and six months after the stroke occurred.&lt;ref name=Stroke/&gt; Amusic subjects were identified one week following their stroke, and over the course of the study, amusics and non-amusics were compared in both brain lesion location and their performances on neuropsychological tests.

Results showed that there was no significant difference in the distribution of left and right hemisphere lesions between amusic and non-amusic groups, but that the amusic group had a significantly higher number of lesions to the [[frontal lobe]] and [[auditory cortex]].&lt;ref name=Stroke/&gt; [[Temporal lobe]] lesions were also observed in patients with amusia.  Amusia is a common occurrence following an [[ischemic]] MCA stroke, as evidenced by the 60% of patients who were found to be amusic at the one-week post-stroke stage.&lt;ref name= Stroke/&gt; While significant recovery takes place over time, amusia can persist for long periods of time.&lt;ref name=Stroke/&gt; Test results suggest that acquired amusia and its recovery in the post-stroke stage are associated with a variety of cognitive functions, particularly attention, executive functioning, and working memory.&lt;ref name=Stroke/&gt;

==Neuroanatomy==
{{Infobox medical condition |Name=Music Processing and the Brain |Image= |Alt=A diagram showing the different sections of the brain and how they relate to music processing. |Caption=An image depicting the different sections of the brain and specific areas that relate to music processing in particular.}}

===Overview===
Many research studies of individuals with amusia show that a number of cortical regions appear to be involved in processing music. Some report that the [[primary auditory cortex]], secondary auditory cortex, and [[limbic system]] are responsible for this faculty, while more recent studies suggest that lesions in other cortical areas, abnormalities in cortical thickness, and deficiency in neural connectivity and brain plasticity may contribute to amusia. While various causes of amusia exist, some general findings that provide insight to the brain mechanisms involved in music processing are discussed below.&lt;ref name=Neuroanatomy/&gt;

===Pitch relations===
Studies suggest that the analysis of pitch is primarily controlled by the right temporal region of the brain. The right secondary auditory cortex processes pitch change and manipulation of fine tunes; specifically, this region distinguishes the multiple pitches that characterize melodic tunes as [[Pitch contour|contour]] (pitch direction) and interval (frequency ratio between successive notes) information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Zatorre R.J., Berlin P. | year = 2001 | title = Spectral and temporal processing in human auditory cortex | url = | journal = Cerebral Cortex | volume = 11 | issue = 10| pages = 946–53 | doi=10.1093/cercor/11.10.946}}&lt;/ref&gt; The right superior temporal gyrus recruits and evaluates contour information, while both right and left temporal regions recruit and evaluate interval information.&lt;ref name=Agnosia&gt;{{cite journal | author = Ayotte J., Peretz I., Rousseau I., Bard C., Bojanowski M. | year = 2000 | title = Patterns of music agnosia associated with middle cerebral artery infarcts | url = | journal = Brain | volume = 123 | issue = 9| pages = 1926–38 | doi=10.1093/brain/123.9.1926 | pmid=10960056}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the right anterolateral part of Heschl's gyrus (primary auditory cortex) is also concerned with processing pitch information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Tramo M., Shah G.D., Braida L.D. | year = 2002 | title = Functional role of auditory cortex in frequency processing and pitch perception | url = | journal = Journal of Neurophysiology | volume = 87 | issue = | pages = 122–39 | doi=10.1152/jn.00104.1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Temporal relations===
The brain analyzes the temporal (rhythmic) components of music in two ways: (1) it segments the ongoing sequences of music into temporal events based on duration, and (2) it groups those temporal events to understand the underlying beat to music. Studies on rhythmic discrimination reveal that the right temporal auditory cortex is responsible for temporal segmenting, and the left temporal auditory cortex is responsible for temporal grouping.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Di Pietro M., Laganaro M., Leeman B., Schnider A. | year = 2004 | title = Receptive amusia: temporal auditory deficit in a processional musician following a left temporo-parietal lesion | url = | journal = Neuropsychologia | volume = 42 | issue = 7| pages = 868–977 | doi=10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2003.12.004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Wilson S.J., Pressing J., Wales R.J. | year = 2002 | title = Modeling rhythmic function in a musician post-stroke | url = | journal = Neuropsychologia | volume = 40 | issue = 8| pages = 1494–505 | doi=10.1016/s0028-3932(01)00198-1 | pmid=11931954}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other studies suggest the participation of motor cortical areas in rhythm perception and production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Halsband U., Tanji J. Feund | year = 1993 | title = The role of premotor cortex and the supplementary motor area in the temporal control of movement in man | url = | journal = Brain | volume = 116 | issue = | pages = 243–46 | doi=10.1093/brain/116.1.243}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, a lack of involvement and networking between bilateral temporal cortices and neural motor centers may contribute to both congenital and acquired amusia.&lt;ref name= Neuroanatomy/&gt;

===Memory===
Memory is required in order to process and integrate both melodic and rhythmic aspects of music. Studies suggest that there is a rich interconnection between the right temporal gyrus and frontal cortical areas for working memory in music appreciation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Zatorre R.J., Samson S. | year = 1991 | title = Role of the right temporal neocortex in retention of pitch in auditory short-term memory | url = | journal = Brain | volume = 114 | issue = 6| pages = 2403–17 | doi=10.1093/brain/114.6.2403}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gaab, N., Gaser, C., Zaehle, T., Jancke, L., Schlaug, G. (2003). Functional anatomy of pitch memory-an fMRI study with sparse temoral sampling. NeuroLmage. 19:1417-1426.&lt;/ref&gt; This connection between the temporal and frontal regions of the brain is extremely important since these regions play critical roles in music processing. Changes in the temporal areas of the amusic brain are most likely associated with deficits in pitch perception and other musical characteristics, while changes in the frontal areas are potentially related to deficits in cognitive processing aspects, such as memory, that are needed for musical discrimination tasks.&lt;ref name=Stroke/&gt; Memory is also concerned with the recognition and internal representation of tunes, which help to identify familiar songs and confer the ability to sing tunes in one's head. The activation of the superior temporal region and left inferior temporal and frontal areas is responsible for the recognition of familiar songs,&lt;ref name=Agnosia/&gt; and the right auditory cortex (a perceptual mechanism) is involved in the internal representation of tunes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Zatorre R.J., Halpern R. | year = 1993 | title = Effect of unilateral temporal-lobe excision on percention and imagery of songs | url = | journal = Neuropsychologia | volume = 31 | issue = 3| pages = 221–32 | doi=10.1016/0028-3932(93)90086-f| pmid = 8492875 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These findings suggest that any abnormalities and/or injuries to these regions of the brain could facilitate amusia.

===Other regions of the brain possibly linked to amusia===
* Lesions (or the absence of) in associations between the right temporal lobe and inferior frontal lobe. In nine of ten tone-deaf people, the superior [[arcuate fasciculus]] in the right hemisphere could not be detected, suggesting a disconnection between the posterior superior temporal gyrus and the posterior inferior frontal gyrus. Researchers suggested the posterior superior temporal gyrus was the origin of the disorder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Loui | first1 = P. | last2 = Alsop | first2 = D. | last3 = Schlaug | first3 = S. | year = 2009 | title = Tone Deafness: A New Disconnection Syndrome? | journal = Journal of Neuroscience | volume = 29 | issue = 33| pages = 10215–120 | doi = 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1701-09.2009 | pmid=19692596 | pmc=2747525}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Cortical thickness and reduced [[white matter]] – in a recent study, [[voxel-based morphometry]], an imaging technique used to explore structural differences in the brain, revealed a decrease in white matter concentration in the right [[inferior frontal gyrus]] of amusic individuals as compared to controls.&lt;ref name=Morphometry&gt;{{cite journal | author = Hyde K. L., Zatorre R. J., Griffiths T. D., Lerch J. P., Peretz I. | year = 2006 | title = Morphometry of the amusic brain: a two-site study." [Article] | url = | journal = Brain | volume = 129 | issue = 10| pages = 2562–70 | doi=10.1093/brain/awl204}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lack of extensive exposure to music could be a contributing factor to this white matter reduction.&lt;ref name=Morphometry/&gt; For example, amusic individuals may be less inclined to listen to music than others, which could ultimately cause reduced [[myelination]] of connections to the frontal areas of the brain.&lt;ref name=Morphometry/&gt;
* Involvement of the parahippocampal gyrus (responsible for the emotional reaction to music)&lt;ref name=Neuroanatomy/&gt;

==Discovery==
In 1825, [[Franz Joseph Gall|F. Gall]] mentioned a "musical organ" in a specific region of the human brain that could be spared or disrupted after a traumatic event resulting in brain damage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://content.karger.com/produktedb/produkte.asp?typ=fulltext&amp;file=000206851. Alossa, Nicoletta; Castelli, Lorys, "Amusia and Musical Functioning", ''Eur Neurol'', Vol. 61, No. 5, pp. 269–77 (2009)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713135718/http://content.karger.com/produktedb/produkte.asp?typ=fulltext&amp;file=000206851. |date=July 13, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1865, [[Jean-Baptiste Bouillaud]] described the first series of cases that involved the loss of music abilities that were due to brain injury. Later, during the late nineteenth-century, several influential neurologists studied language in an attempt to construct a [[theory of cognitive development|theory of cognition]]. While not studied as thoroughly as language, music and visual processing were also studied. In 1888–1890, [[August Knoblauch]] produced a cognitive model for music processing and termed it amusia. This model for music processing was the earliest produced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/S0278-2626(02)00527-4 | volume=51 | title=August Knoblauch and amusia: A nineteenth-century cognitive model of music | journal=Brain and Cognition | pages=102–14 | year=2003 | author=Johnson Julene K}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Case studies==

===First documented case of congenital amusia===
While the possibility that certain individuals may be born with musical deficits is not a new notion, the first documented case of congenital amusia was published relatively recently.&lt;ref name=Fine-grained/&gt; The study was conducted with a female volunteer, referred to as Monica, who declared herself to be musically impaired in response to an advertisement in the newspaper.&lt;ref name=Fine-grained/&gt; Monica had no psychiatric or neurological history, nor did she have any hearing loss. MRI scans showed no abnormalities. Monica also scored above average on a standard intelligence test, and her working memory was evaluated and found to be normal. However, Monica suffers from a lifelong inability to recognize or perceive music, which has persisted even after involvement with music through church choir and band during her childhood and teenage years.&lt;ref name=Fine-grained/&gt; Monica even admits that she does not enjoy listening to music because, to her, it sounds like noise and evokes a stressful response.

In order to determine if Monica's disorder is amusia, she was subjected to the MBEA series of tests. One of the tests dealt with Monica's difficulties in discriminating pitch variations in sequential notes. In this test, a pair of melodies was played, and Monica was asked if the second melody in the pair contained a wrong note.&lt;ref name=Fine-grained/&gt; Monica's score on this test was well below the average score generated by the control group.&lt;ref name=Fine-grained/&gt; Further tests showed that Monica struggles with recognizing highly familiar melodies, but that she has no problems in recognizing the voices of well-known speakers. Thus, it appears that Monica's deficit seems limited to music.&lt;ref name=Fine-grained/&gt; A later study showed that not only do amusics experience difficulty in discriminating variations in pitch, but they also exhibit deficits in perceiving patterns in pitch.&lt;ref name=Tone-deaf&gt;{{cite journal | author = Foxton J. M., Dean J. L., Gee R., Peretz I., Griffiths T. D. | year = 2004 | title = Characterization of deficits in pitch perception underlying 'tone deafness'." [Article] | url = | journal = Brain | volume = 127 | issue = 4| pages = 801–10 | doi=10.1093/brain/awh105}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This finding led to another test that was designed to assess the presence of a deficiency in pitch perception.&lt;ref name=Fine-grained/&gt; In this test, Monica heard a sequence of five piano tones of constant pitch followed by a comparison sequence of five piano tones in which the fourth tone could be the same pitch as the other notes in the sequence or a completely different pitch altogether. Monica was asked to respond "yes" if she detected a pitch change on the fourth tone or respond "no" if she could not detect a pitch change.  Results show that Monica could barely detect a pitch change as large as two [[semitone]]s ([[whole tone]]), or half steps.&lt;ref name=Fine-grained/&gt; While this pitch-processing deficit is extremely severe, it does not seem to include speech intonation.&lt;ref name=Fine-grained/&gt; This is because pitch variations in speech are very coarse compared with those used in music.&lt;ref name= Insights/&gt; In conclusion, Monica's learning disability arises from a basic problem in pitch discrimination, which is viewed as the origin of congenital amusia.&lt;ref name=Fine-grained/&gt;

===Family aggregation study===
Another interesting question posed about congenital amusia is if it has a genetic origin.&lt;ref name=Family/&gt; A study was conducted to test for the presence of a genetic origin by studying family aggregation of congenital amusia.&lt;ref name=Family/&gt; Family members of amusics were studied, as well as family members of a control group. The study yielded interesting results. Amusia cannot be attributed solely to family environment due to the presence of at least one unaffected sibling in each tested family in the amusic group.&lt;ref name=Family/&gt; Also, music was found to be present to a lesser extent, but not absent, in the environment of the amusic subjects than in that of the musically intact control group.&lt;ref name=Family/&gt; This supports the claim that the occurrence of congenital amusia cannot be explained by a lack of environmental stimulation. Another interesting finding was that the next generation, or the offspring of those with congenital amusia, was more musical.&lt;ref name=Family/&gt; A reason for this might be that musical stimulation for the offspring probably started early in life when their brains were more plastic.&lt;ref name=Family/&gt;

Overall, test results support the view that congenital amusia is hereditary.&lt;ref name=Family/&gt; It is likely to be influenced by several genes that interact to increase an individual's susceptibility to its development.&lt;ref name=Family/&gt; However, the fact that the offspring have a lower risk of developing congenital amusia shows that it can be less prevalent when the musical environment is enriched.&lt;ref name=Family/&gt; This stresses the importance that experience-dependent tuning has in the musical pitch system.&lt;ref name=Family/&gt;

===Singing in congenital amusia===
While it is known that congenital amusia is a disorder characterized by poor pitch perception, a recent study sought to discover to what extent this pitch deficit may compromise singing.&lt;ref name=Singing&gt;{{cite journal | author = Bella S. D., Giguere J. F., Peretz I. | year = 2009 | title = Singing in congenital amusia | doi = 10.1121/1.3132504 | journal = Journal of the Acoustical Society of America | volume = 126 | issue = 1| pages = 414–24 | bibcode = 2009ASAJ..126..414D }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this study, eleven amusic individuals and eleven controls were asked to sing a familiar song using the lyrics first, and then using the syllable "la". Results showed that individuals with congenital amusia were poor singers.&lt;ref name=Singing/&gt; They could not maintain a stable pitch, nor could they sing the correct pitch intervals that were written in the music. However, many of the amusic testing subjects were able to sing with the correct rhythm.&lt;ref name=Singing/&gt; The results confirmed that the amusics' ability to detect pitch changes influences their level of singing proficiency.&lt;ref name=Singing/&gt; The subjects who struggled the most with pitch perception were the most unstable in producing the correct pitch and made several pitch interval and contour errors. However, there were some remarkable exceptions. A couple of amusic individuals were able to sing proficiently despite extremely impaired pitch perception.&lt;ref name=Singing/&gt;

The results of singing with the lyrics and singing on the syllable "la" can also be compared. Although most of the amusic subjects struggled with maintaining the correct pitch when singing with lyrics, they were able to complete the task. However, when singing the same song on the syllable "la", more than half of the amusic subjects could only sing a few notes.&lt;ref name=Singing/&gt; This is due to a poor memory of the musical component of songs.&lt;ref name=Singing/&gt; Overall, it was concluded that singing deficiency in amusic individuals might be a result of their pitch perception deficit.&lt;ref name=Singing/&gt; However, the existence of amusic individuals who are able to sing proficiently suggests that there may be separate neural pathways for auditory perception and action.&lt;ref name=Singing/&gt;

Amusia has recently been classified as a learning disability that affects musical abilities.&lt;ref name=Congenital&gt;{{cite journal | author = Ayotte Julie, Peretz Isabelle, Hyde Krista | year = 2002 | title = Congenital Amusia | url = | journal = Brain | volume = 125 | issue = 2| pages = 238–51 | doi=10.1093/brain/awf028 | pmid=11844725}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research suggests that in congenital amusia, younger subjects can be taught tone differentiation techniques. This finding leads researchers to believe that amusia is related to [[dyslexia]] and other similar disorders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Peretz Isabelle, Brattico Elvira, Tervaniemi Mari | year = 2002 | title = Abnormal Electrical Brain Responses to Pitch in Congenital Amusia | url = http://www.bio-medicine.org/medicine-news/Brain-Patterns-In-Amusia-May-Be-Related-To-Other-Disorders-4751-1/ | journal = Annals of Neurology | volume = 58 | issue = 3| pages = 478–82| doi = 10.1002/ana.20606 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Research has been shown that amusia may be related to an increase in size of the [[cerebral cortex]], which may be a result of a malformation in cortical development. Diseases such as dyslexia and [[epilepsy]] are due to a malformation in cortical development and also lead to an increase in cortical thickness, which leads researchers to believe that congenital amusia may be caused by the identical phenomenon in a different area of the brain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Hyde Krista, Lerch Jason, Zatorre Robert J | year = 2007| title = Cortical Thickness in Congenital Amusia: When Less Is Better Than More. | url = | journal = The Journal of Neuroscience | volume = 27 | issue = 47| pages = 13028–32 | doi=10.1523/jneurosci.3039-07.2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Amusia is also similar to [[aphasia]] in that they affect similar areas of the [[human brain|brain]] near the [[temporal lobe]]. Most cases of those with amusia do not show any symptoms of aphasia. However, a number of cases have shown that those who have aphasia can exhibit symptoms of amusia, especially in acquired aphasia. The two are not mutually exclusive and having one does not imply possession of the other.&lt;ref name=Congenital/&gt; In acquired amusia, inability to perceive music correlates with an inability to perform other higher-level functions. As musical ability improves, so too do the higher cognitive functions which suggests that musical ability is closely related to these higher-level functions, such as [[memory]] and [[learning]], mental flexibility, and semantic fluency.&lt;ref name=Stroke/&gt;

Amusia can also be related to [[aprosody]], a disorder in which the sufferer's speech is affected, becoming extremely monotonous. It has been found that both amusia and aprosody can arise from seizures occurring in the non-dominant hemisphere.&lt;ref name=aprosody&gt;{{cite journal | author = Bautista R.E., Ciampetti M.Z. | year = 2003 | title = Expressive Aprosody and Amusia as a Manifestation of Right Hemisphere Seizures | url = | journal = Epilepsia | volume = 44 | issue = 3| pages = 466–67 | doi=10.1046/j.1528-1157.2003.36502.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; They can also both arise from lesions to the brain, as can Broca's aphasia come about simultaneously with amusia from injury.&lt;ref name=aprosody/&gt; There is a relation between musical abilities and the components of speech, however, they are not understood very well.&lt;ref name=aprosody/&gt;

==Social and emotional impact==
Other than their inability to hear music, which is most likely due to a [[genetic disorder|genetic defect]], the rest of an amusic's brain remains normal. The only effect is on the ability to tell different notes apart due to the separation of two key areas in the brain. Most sufferers of amusia describe music as unpleasant. Others simply refer to it as noise and find it annoying. This can have social implications because amusics often try to avoid music, which in many social situations is not an option. In China and other countries in which identical words have different meanings based on pitch, amusia may have a much more pronounced social and emotional impact: difficulty in speaking and understanding the language.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gold.ac.uk/media/2005_BBC_Music_Magazine.pdf Stewart, Lauren, "Pitch Fever", BBC Music Magazine, pp. 36–38, (October 2005)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120406231451/http://www.gold.ac.uk/media/2005_BBC_Music_Magazine.pdf |date=April 6, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Treatment==
Currently, no forms of treatment have proven effective in treating amusia. One study has shown tone differentiation techniques to have some success, however future research on treatment of this disorder will be necessary to verify this technique as an appropriate treatment.&lt;ref name=Congenital/&gt;

==Future research==
Over the past decade, much has been discovered about amusia. However, there remains a great deal more to learn. While a method of treatment for people with amusia has not been defined, tone differentiation techniques have been used on amusic patients with some success. It was found with this research that children reacted positively to these tone differentiation techniques, while adults found the training annoying.&lt;ref name=Congenital/&gt; However, further research in this direction would aid in determining if this would be a viable treatment option for people with amusia. Additional research can also serve to indicate which processing component in the brain is essential for normal music development.&lt;ref name=Fine-grained/&gt; Also, it would be extremely beneficial to investigate musical learning in relation to amusia since this could provide valuable insights into other forms of learning disabilities such as [[dysphasia]] and dyslexia.&lt;ref name=Music-specific/&gt;&lt;ref name=Fine-grained/&gt;

[[Image:Animal Research Institute, Headquarters.jpg|thumb|Animal Research Institute, Headquarters.]]
'''Animal Research Institute''' is a research institute in [[Greece]]. It is part of the [[National Agricultural Research Foundation]].

==History==
[[Image:Alfalfa hay collection.jpg|thumb|Alfalfa hay collection.]]
[[Image:Florina (Pelagonia) sheep breed.jpg|thumb|Florina (Pelagonia) sheep breed.]]
[[Image:Chios sheep breed.jpg|thumb|Chios sheep breed.]]
The Animal Research Institute (ARI) was founded in 1952 as a unit of the Ministry of Agriculture and under the name ‘Animal Research Station’. In 1961 it became ‘Institute of Animal Breeding and Nutrition’ and in 1977 it took its present name. ARI has been part of the National Agricultural Research Foundation (N.AG.RE.F.) since 1990 and it is located on 3.5 square kilometres of farmland in Paralimni-[[Giannitsa]], Northern Greece.

==Objective==
The ARI is an institute oriented toward research on general and special zootechnics and includes a specialized scientific staff. The ARI promotes research and technological activities aiming at an integrated approach to deal with rural problems within the framework of national agricultural policy and the agricultural policy of the [[European Union]] (EU). The ARI supports and coordinates initiatives for development suggested by the [[Ministry of Rural Development and Food]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.minagric.gr Ministry of Rural Development and Food]&lt;/ref&gt; [[List of universities in Greece|Greek Universities]] and Institutions, the agricultural cooperatives, product distributors, producers’ groups etc.

==Activities==
ARI’s activities cover cross-sectional scientific disciplines related to the animal production with ARI being responsible for their development. ARI is engaged in the research on animal production, especially in the spheres of animal nutrition and physiology, feeding techniques, nutrition and growth, technological systems of farm animal husbandry, genetics and breeding of farm animals, physiology of reproduction (in collaboration with the [[Veterinary Research Institute of Thessaloniki]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vri.gr Veterinary Research Institute of Thessaloniki]&lt;/ref&gt;), ethology of farm animals, improvement in the quality of animal products with respect to food safety and quality in human nutrition.

==Farm, facilities and animals==
Purpose–oriented farming serves as a base for experimental activities. The ARI’s area is 3.5 square kilometres of agricultural land, out of it 3.2&amp;nbsp;km² of arable land with cropping plan focused on preferential provisions of experiments and 0.3&amp;nbsp;km² with facilities for experiments with cattle, sheep, pigs and poultry. Today in ARI there are farmed cattle and sheep. The average number of animals is as follow: cattle in total 200, out of it 70 dairy cows, 1000 sheep in total, out of it 550 sheep of Chios breed and 450 sheep of Florina (Pelagonia) breed.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9935">The [[ethologist]] [[John B. Calhoun]] coined the term "'''behavioral sink'''" to describe the collapse in behavior which resulted from [[overcrowding]].  Over a number of years, Calhoun conducted over-population experiments on [[Norway rat]]s (in 1958&amp;ndash;1962) and [[mice]] (in 1968&amp;ndash;1972).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Calhoun coined the term "behavioral sink" in his February 1, 1962 report in an article titled ''Population Density and Social Pathology'' in ''Scientific American'' &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Population Density and Social Pathology|url = http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/population-density-and-social-patho/|website = Scientific American|accessdate = 2015-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; on the rat experiment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

 | pmid= 13875732
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Calhoun's work became used as an animal model of [[societal collapse]], and his study has become a touchstone of [[urban sociology]] and [[psychology]] in general.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1962 study, Calhoun described the behavior as follows:

{{bquote|Many [female rats] were unable to carry pregnancy to full term or to survive delivery of their litters if they did. An even greater number, after successfully giving birth, fell short in their maternal functions. Among the males the behavior disturbances ranged from sexual deviation to cannibalism and from frenetic overactivity to a pathological withdrawal from which individuals would emerge to eat, drink and move about only when other members of the community were asleep. The social organization of the animals showed equal disruption. ...

The common source of these disturbances became most dramatically apparent in the populations of our first series of three experiments, in which we observed the development of what we called a behavioral sink. The animals would crowd together in greatest number in one of the four interconnecting pens in which the colony was maintained. As many as 60 of the 80 rats in each experimental population would assemble in one pen during periods of feeding. Individual rats would rarely eat except in the company of other rats. As a result extreme population densities developed in the pen adopted for eating, leaving the others with sparse populations.

... In the experiments in which the behavioral sink developed, infant mortality ran as high as 96 percent among the most disoriented groups in the population.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

| year = 1970 
| pmid = 18730425 
| pmc = 1501789
}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Calhoun would continue his experiments for many years, but the publication of the 1962 article put the concept in the public domain, where it took root in popular culture as an analogy for human behavior.

Calhoun retired from [[National Institute of Mental Health|NIMH]] in 1984, but continued to work on his research results until his death on September 7, 1995.&lt;ref name="NLM Announces the Public Release of the Papers of John B. Calhoun"&gt;[https://www.nlm.nih.gov/news/calhoun_papers_released.html NLM Announces the Public Release of the Papers of John B. Calhoun], U.S. National Library of Medicine, 2013-10-13.&lt;/ref&gt;

== The experiments ==
Calhoun's early experiments with rats were carried out on farmland at [[Rockville, Maryland]], starting in 1947.&lt;ref name=cabinet2011&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cabinetmagazine.org/issues/42/wiles.php|title=The Behavioral Sink|publisher=Cabinet Magazine|date=Summer 2011|accessdate=2012-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While Calhoun was working at NIMH in 1954, he began numerous experiments with rats and mice. During his first tests, he placed around 32 to 56 rodents in a 10 x 14-foot case in a barn in Montgomery County. He separated the space into four rooms. Every room was specifically created to support a dozen matured brown Norwegian rats. Rats could maneuver between the rooms by using the ramps. Since Calhoun provided unlimited resources, such as water, food, and also protection from predators as well as from disease and weather, the rats were said to be in "rat utopia" or "mouse paradise", another psychologist explained.&lt;ref name="Medical Historian Examines NIMH Experiments in Crowding"&gt;[http://nihrecord.od.nih.gov/newsletters/2008/07_25_2008/story1.htm Medical Historian Examines NIMH Experiments in Crowding] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130327132421/http://nihrecord.od.nih.gov/newsletters/2008/07_25_2008/story1.htm |date=2013-03-27 }}, nih record, 2013-10-13.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following his earlier experiments with rats, in 1972 Calhoun would later create his "Mortality-Inhibiting Environment for Mice": a 101-inch square cage for [[mice]] with food and water replenished to support any increase in population,&lt;ref name ="deathsquared"/&gt; which took his experimental approach to its limits. In his most famous experiment in the series, "Universe 25", population peaked at 2,200 mice and thereafter exhibited a variety of abnormal, often destructive behaviors. By the 600th day, the population was on its way to extinction.&lt;ref name=cabinet2011/&gt;

== Influence of the concept ==
{{expand section|date=August 2012}}
The 1962 ''Scientific American'' article came at a time at which [[human overpopulation|overpopulation]] had become a subject of great public interest, and had a considerable cultural influence.&lt;ref name=ramsdenadams2009&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study was directly referenced in some works of fiction,&lt;ref name=ramsdenadams2009/&gt; and may have been an influence on many more.

Controversy exists over the implications of the experiment. Psychologist Jonathan Freedman's experiment recruited high school and university students to carry out a series of experiments that measured the effects of density on behavior. He measured their stress, discomfort, aggression, competitiveness, and general unpleasantness. He declared to have found no appreciable negative effects in 1975. Researchers argued that "Calhoun's work was not simply about density in a physical sense, as number of individuals-per-square-unit-area, but was about degrees of social interaction."&lt;ref&gt;Garnett, Carla.

{{Political anthropology|expanded=Basic concepts}}

A '''big man''' is a highly influential individual in a [[tribe]], especially in [[Melanesia]] and [[Polynesia]]. Such a person may not have formal tribal or other authority (through for instance material possessions, or inheritance of rights), but can maintain recognition through skilled persuasion and wisdom. The big man has a large group of followers, both from his [[clan]] and from other clans. He provides his followers with protection and economic assistance, in return receiving support which he uses to increase his status.

==Big man "system"==

The [[United States|American]] anthropologist [[Marshall Sahlins]] has studied the big man phenomenon. In his much-quoted&lt;ref&gt;
James Whitley ("Social Diversity in Dark Age Greece", ''The Annual of the British School at Athens'' '''86''' (1991:341-365) applied Sahlins' ethnographic model to instability in settlement patterns during the [[Greek Dark Age]], 10th-8th centuries BCE.
&lt;/ref&gt; 
1963 article  "Poor Man, Rich Man, Big Man, Chief: Political Types in [[Melanesia]] and [[Polynesia]]", Sahlins uses analytically constructed ideal-types of hierarchy and equality to compare a larger-scale Polynesian-type hierarchical society of chiefs and sub-chiefs with a Melanesian-type big-man system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |URL=http://tapera.info/textos/sahlins,hrhp.pdf |author=Marshall Sahlins |title=Poor Man, Rich Man, Big Man, Chief; Political Types in Melanesia and Polynesia |journal=Comparative Studies in Society and History |volume=5 |number=3 |pages=285-303 |date=April 1963 |archive-date=1 January 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140101000000/http://tapera.info/textos/sahlins,hrhp.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The latter consists of segmented lineage groups, locally held together by faction-leaders who compete for power in the social structure of horizontally arranged and principally equal groupings (factions). Here, leadership is not ascribed, but rather gained through action and competition "with other ambitious men".

==Position==
{{main|Moka exchange}}
A big man's position is never secured in an inherited position at the top of a hierarchy, but is always challenged by the different big-men who compete with one another in an ongoing process of [[reciprocity (cultural anthropology)|reciprocity]] and re-distribution of material and political resources. As such the big man is subject to a [[Transactional analysis|transactional]] order based on his ability to balance the simultaneously opposing pulls of securing his own renown through distributing resources to other big man groups (thereby spreading the word of his power and abilities) ''and'' redistributing resources to the people of his own faction (thereby keeping them content followers of his able leadership).

The big man concept is relatively fluid, and formal authority of such figures is very low to nonexistent. His position is not inherently heritable.

In the Island of Malaita in Solomon Islands the big man system is dying away as westernization is influencing the people,{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} but the big man system can be seen at the political level. Every four years in [[Solomon Islands]]' National Elections the system can be clearly seen among the people, especially in the Melanesian Islands.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}

==System in Papua New Guinea==
The first use of the term may be found in the English-translation of Dreissig Jahre in der Sudsee (1907) by [[Richard Parkinson (explorer)|Richard Parkinson]]. The term may be often found in many historical works dealing with Papua New Guinea. Andrew J. Strathern&lt;ref&gt;Strathern, ''The Rope of Moka: big-men and ceremonial exchange in Mount Hagen, Papua New Guinea'' (Cambridge, 1971)&lt;/ref&gt; applies the concept of big-men to a community in [[Mount Hagen]], Papua New Guinea.

Traditionally, among peoples of non-[[Austronesian]]-speaking communities, authority was obtained by a man (the so-called "big man") recognised as "performing most capably in social, political, economic and ceremonial activities".&lt;ref&gt;Waiko, John D. (1993). ''A Short History of Papua New Guinea'', Melbourne: Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|0-19-553164-7}}, p.9&lt;/ref&gt; His function was not to command, but to influence his society through his example. He was expected to act as a negotiator with neighbouring groups, and to periodically redistribute food (generally produced by his wives). In this sense, he was seen as ensuring the well-being of his community.

Such a system is still found in many parts of [[Papua New Guinea]], and other parts of [[Melanesia]].

==Trans-Himalayan Region==

The Himalayan ranges immediately north of the Great Himalayan range are called the Trans- Himalayas. The Trans-Himalayan region with its sparse vegetation has the richest wild sheep and goat community in the world. The snow leopard is found here, as is the migratory black-necked crane.

==Himalayas==
[[File:Himalayas Map.png|alt=Bio-geographical representation of himalayas.|thumb|234x234px|Bio-geographical representation of himalayas.]]
The Himalayas consist of the youngest and loftiest mountain chains in the world. The Himalayas have attained a unique personality owing to their high altitude, steep gradient and rich temperate flora.

The forests are very dense with extensive growth of grass and evergreen tall trees. Oak, chestnut, conifer, ash, pine, deodar are abundant in Himalayas. There is no vegetation above the snowline. Several interesting animals live in the Himalayan ranges. Chief species include wild sheep, mountain goats, ibex, shrew, and tapir. Panda and snow leopard are also found here.

==Semi-Arid Areas==

Adjoining the desert are the semi-arid areas, a transitional zone between the desert and the denser forests of the Western Ghats. The natural vegetation is thorn forest. This region is characterized by discontinuous vegetation cover with open areas of bare soil and soil-water deficit throughout the year.

Thorny shrubs, grasses and some bamboos are present in some regions. A few species of xerophytic herbs and some ephemeral herbs are found in this semi-arid tract. Birds, jackals, leopards, eagles, snakes, fox, buffaloes are found in this region.

==Western Ghats==

The mountains along the west coast of peninsular India are the Western Ghats, which constitute one of the unique biological regions of the world. The Western Ghats extend from the southern tip of the peninsula (8°N) northwards about 1600&amp;nbsp;km to the mouth of the river Tapti (21°N).

The mountains rise to average altitudes between 900 and 1500 m above sea level, intercepting monsoon winds from the southwest and creating a rain shadow in the region to their East.

The varied climate and diverse topography create a wide array of habitats that support unique sets of plant and animal species. Apart from biological diversity, the region boasts of high levels of cultural diversity, as many indigenous people inhabit its forests.

The Western Ghats are amongst the 25 biodiversity hot-spots recognized globally. These hills are known for their high levels of endemism expressed at both higher and lower taxonomic levels. Most of the Western Ghat endemic plants are associated with evergreen forests.

The region also shares several plant species with Sri Lanka. The higher altitude forests were, if at all, sparsely populated with tribal people. Rice cultivation in the fertile valley proceeded gardens of early commercial crops like areca nut and pepper. The original vegetation of the ill-drained valley bottoms with sluggish streams in elevations below 100m would be often a special formation, the Myristica swamp.

Expansion of traditional agriculture and the spread of particularly rubber, tea, coffee and forest tree plantations would have wiped out large pockets of primary forests in valleys. The Western Ghats are well known for harboring 14 endemic species of caecilians (i.e., legless amphibians) out of 15 recorded from the region so far.

==North-West Desert Regions==

This region consists of parts of Rajasthan, Kutch, Delhi and parts of Gujarat. The climate is characterised by very hot and dry summer and cold winter. Rainfall is less than 70&amp;nbsp;cm. The plants are mostly xerophytic. Babul, Kikar, wild palm grows in areas of moderate rainfall. Indian Bustard, a highly endangered bird is found here. Camels, wild asses, foxes, and snakes are found in hot and arid parts of the desert.

==Deccan Plateau==

Beyond the Ghats is Deccan Plateau, a semi-arid region lying in the rain shadow of the Western Ghats. This is the largest unit of the Peninsular Plateau of India. The highlands of the plateau are covered with different types of forests, which provide a large variety of forest products.the Deccan plateau includes the region lying south of the Satpura range.it extends up to the southern tip of peninsular India.Anai mudi is the highest peak of this region.The Deccan plateau is surrounded by the western and the eastern ghats.These ghats meet each other at the Nilgiri hills. The western ghats includes the Sahyadri, Nilgiris, Anamalai, and cardamom hills.many rivers such as Mahanadi, Godavari, krishna, and kaveri originates from western ghats and flow toward the east.The eastern ghats are broken into small hill rangesby river coming from the western ghats.Most of these rivers fall into the bay of bengal.The Godavari is the longest river in the Deccan plateau .the Narmada and the Tapi flow westwards and fall into the Arabian sea.

==Gangetic Plain==

In the North is the Gangetic plain extending up to the Himalayan foothills. This is the largest unit of the Great Plain of India. Ganga is the main river after whose name this plain is named. The aggradational Great Plains cover about 72.4mha area with the Ganga and the Brahmaputra forming the main drainage axes in the major portion.

The thickness in the alluvial sediments varies considerably with its maximum in the Ganga plains. The physiogeographic scenery varies greatly from arid and semi-arid landscapes of the Rajasthan Plains to the humid and per-humid landscapes of the Delta and Assam valley in the east.

Topographic uniformity, except in the arid Western Rajasthan is a common feature throughout these plains. The plain supports some of the highest population densities depending upon purely agro-based economy in some of these areas. The trees belonging to these forests are teak, sal, shisham, mahua, khair etc.

==North-East India==

North-east India is one of the richest flora regions in the country. It has several species of orchids, bamboos, ferns and other plants. Here the wild relatives of cultivated plants such as banana, mango, citrus and pepper can be grown

==Islands==

The two groups of islands, i.e., the Arabian Sea islands and Bay Islands differ significantly in origin and physical characteristics. The Arabian Sea Islands (Laccadive, Minicoy, etc.) are the foundered remnants of the old land mass and subsequent coral formations. On the other hand, the Bay Islands lay only about 220&amp;nbsp;km.

Away from the nearest point on the main land mass and extend about 590&amp;nbsp;km. With a maximum width of 58&amp;nbsp;km the island forests of Lakshadweep in the Arabian Sea have some of the best-preserved evergreen forests of India. Some of the islands are fringed with coral reefs. Many of them are covered with thick forests and some are highly dissected.

==Coasts==

India has a coastline extending over 7,516. 4&amp;nbsp;km. The Indian coasts vary in their characteristics and structures. The west coast is narrow except around the Gulf of Cambay and the Gulf of Kutch. In the extreme south, however, it is somewhat wider along the south Sahyadri.

The backwaters are the characteristic features of this coast. The east coast plains, in contrast are broader due to depositional activities of the east-flowing rivers owing to the change in their base levels.

Extensive deltas of the 
, Godavari, Krishna and Kaveri are the characteristic features of this coast. Mangrove vegetation is characteristic of estuarine tracts along the coast for instance, at Ratnagiri in Maharashtra.

Larger parts of the coastal plains are covered by fertile soils on which different crops are grown. Rice is the main crop of these areas. Coconut trees grow all along the coast.
    
       Coconut and rubber are the main vegetation of coastal area.
       Main states of coastal areas are- Gujarat, Maharashtra, Goa, Karnataka, Kerala, west Bengal, Odisha, Andra pradesh, Tamil nadu and Puducherry.

'''The Center for Jewish–Christian Understanding and Cooperation''' or '''CJCUC''' is an educational institution at which Christians who tour Israel can study the [[Hebrew Bible]] with [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] rabbis and learn about the Hebraic roots of Christianity. The center was established in [[Efrat]] in 2008 by Rabbi Dr. [[Shlomo Riskin]], who has been described as "the most prominent rabbinic spokesperson to Christian Zionists".&lt;ref name=jesus&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/14755610.2011.633537|title=The Messiah and Rabbi Jesus: Policing the Jewish–Christian border in Christian Zionism|journal=Culture and Religion: An Interdisciplinary Journal|first=Faydra L.|last=Shapiro|year=2012|volume=12|issue=4|pages=463–477|doi=10.1080/14755610.2011.633537}}&lt;/ref&gt; CJCUC partners with major Christian interfaith organizations such as [[Christians United for Israel]] and the [[International Christian Embassy Jerusalem]].&lt;ref name=jesus/&gt;

== History ==
The ideological groundwork, which led to the eventual establishment of CJCUC in 2008, began to take shape almost 50 years beforehand. In 1964, Rabbi [[Joseph B. Soloveitchik]], the teacher and mentor of CJCUC's Chancellor and Founder, [[Shlomo Riskin]], published an essay entitled "Confrontation"&lt;ref&gt;''Confrontation'', Tradition 6:2 p5-9, 1964. Reprinted in "A Treasury of Tradition", Hebrew Publishing Co, NY, 1967. – {{OCLC|1974913}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which he expounded his views on interfaith dialogue and carefully drew out guidelines which permitted such a dialogue and, in the view of Riskin, not only permitted it but rendered it necessary.

At around the same time, fundamental ideological shifts were forming within the ranks of the Catholic Church, and a year after Soloveitchik's essay was published, [[The Holy See]] issued ''[[Nostra aetate]]'', the Declaration on the Relation of the Church with Non-Christian Religions. ''Nostra aetate'' absolved the Jews from the [[crucifixion of Jesus]], and admitted that religious antisemitism had a significant role in laying the foundation for the atrocities perpetrated against the Jewish people.

Riskin's academic plunge into Jewish–Christian relations began in the early 1960s when he attended seminars, held by Professor [[David Flusser]], about the Christian Gospels at The [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]]. As an [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox Jew]], he could pinpoint the parallels for Jesus' teachings within the Hebrew scripture.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://www.scribd.com/doc/93213735/gadol-2 Shabat HaGadol]'' – translated from Hebrew – page 15&lt;/ref&gt;

After settling in Efrat, Riskin began to engage with the Christian world. Most of the Christian visitors to Efrat, those who came to hear and learn, were [[Evangelicalism|Evangelicals]]. He formed relations with Rev. Robert Stearns of Eagles' Wings and with Pastor [[John Hagee]].&lt;ref&gt;''[https://www.scribd.com/doc/93213735/gadol-2 Shabat HaGadol]'' – translated from Hebrew – page 18&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="shabbat-gadol"&gt;{{cite web|language=he|url=https://musaf-shabbat.com/2012/05/17/%D7%93%D7%99%D7%90%D7%9C%D7%95%D7%92-%D7%99%D7%94%D7%95%D7%93%D7%99-%D7%A0%D7%95%D7%A6%D7%A8%D7%99-%D7%97%D7%A9%D7%99%D7%91%D7%94-%D7%9E%D7%97%D7%95%D7%93%D7%A9%D7%AA-%D7%A9%D7%9C%D7%9E%D7%94/|title=Jewish–Christian Dialogue: Rethinking|first=Zur|last=Erlich|publisher=[[Makor Rishon]]|date=17 May 2012|access-date=25 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The unprecedented statement, entitled ''"To Do the Will of Our Father in Heaven: Toward a Partnership between Jews and Christians"'', was initially signed by over 25 prominent Orthodox rabbis in Israel, United States, and Europe,&lt;ref name="vaticanradio" /&gt; and now has over 60 signatories.&lt;ref name="orthodox-rabbinic-statement-on-christianity"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cjcuc.com/site/2015/12/03/orthodox-rabbinic-statement-on-christianity/|title=Orthodox Rabbinic Statement on Christianity – To Do the Will of Our Father in Heaven – Toward a Partnership between Jews and Christians|website=CJCUC|date=3 December 2015|access-date=16 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{pull quote|The real importance of this Orthodox statement is that it calls for fraternal partnership between Jewish and Christian religious leaders, while also acknowledging the positive theological status of the Christian faith.

The [[Banque de France]] has announced the opening of the '''Cité de l'économie et de la monnaie''' during a press conference held by Governor [[Christian Noyer]], on May 25, 2011. Its opening is programmed for the end of 2014.

This educational place aims at explaining the economy and its concepts to the general public; it will be hosted in the [[Hotel Gaillard]], located at 1, Place du General Catroux, in the 17th district in [[Paris]].

==The project==

[[File:Cité de l'économie et de la monnaie.jpg|thumb|alt=Grand lobby of the future Cité de l'économie et de la monnaie|Grand Lobby of the future Cité de l'économie et de la monnaie, architectural and museographic contest, 2011.]]

This place will invite the general public to discover economics, to tackle issues often met in everyday life, or to allow a better understanding of worldwide events.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.citedeleconomie.fr/IMG/pdf/Discours_C_Noyer_conf_presse_2505.pdf Banque de France Governor Christian Noyer's speech]{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, Press conference, May 25th, 2011 : Launching of the Cité de l'économie et de la monnaie project&lt;/ref&gt;

The Cité de l'économie et de la monnaie will inter alia address teachers and their students, to help illustrate concepts studied at school (indeed half of the 100 000 annual visitors expected should be of school age).&lt;ref&gt;Banque de France press release [http://www.banque-france.fr/fr/instit/communiques/2011/cite-economie-monnaie.htm "''Un grand projet pour un lieu unique : Cité de l'économie et de la monnaie'']", May 25th, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The project is launched by the [[Banque de France]], which collaborates with several partners.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.banque-france.fr/fr/instit/telechar/communiques/dossier-presse-CEM.pdf Press kit: Cité de l'économie et de la monnaie.]&lt;/ref&gt; Among those partners:

* The [[Ministry of National Education (France)]] supports the project and has delegated several teachers to help on the content of the Cité de l'économie et de la monnaie.
* The museums of other Central Banks which already exist, like those of the [[European Union]] or the [[Interactive Museum of Economics]] (MIDE), in Mexico.
* Universcience, and especially the [[Cité des Sciences et de l'Industrie]] : [[Christian Noyer]], Governor of the [[Banque de France]], and [[Claudie Haigneré]], head of Universcience, have signed a cooperation agreement on the museography of the future Cité de l'économie et de la monnaie.
* The ''Institut pour l'Education Financière du Public'', with whom a partnership has been concluded in late 2010.
* The [[Bibliothèque nationale de France]](BnF) : Governor [[Christian Noyer]] and President of the [[Bibliothèque nationale de France]] [[Bruno Racine]] have signed a cooperation agreement on January 3, 2012, regarding the presentation of coin and banknote collections in the future Cité de l'économie et de la monnaie.
* The Rencontres des SES : initiative developed by the [[:fr:Académie de Paris|Académie de Paris]], where 11th grade students studying Economics and Social Sciences are invited to meet economists, in order to discuss themes linked to current issues.
* The Little Conferences of the [[:fr:Nouveau Théâtre de Montreuil|Nouveau Théâtre de Montreuil]] : a partnership with the Cité de l'économie et de la monnaie was announced on February 11, 2012, during [[Jean-Claude Trichet]] (former [[Banque de France]] Governor and former President of the [[European Central Bank]])'s conference on the history of money. The partnership is developed around their shared objective of increasing young people's access to knowledge.

==The building==

The Cité de l'économie et de la monnaie will be hosted in the [[Hotel Gaillard]], located at 1, Place du Général Catroux, in the 17th district in [[Paris]].

This neo-gothic mansion has been realized by architect Jules Février at request of Emile Gaillard, banker from the city of [[Grenoble]] and amateur and collector of [[Middle Ages]] and [[Renaissance]] art. The [[Hotel Gaillard]] was sold to the [[Banque de France]] in 1919.

From 1919 to 1921, architectural works have been directed by architect Alphonse Defrasse for the [[Banque de France]], especially the building of a steel structure which housed the cashier's desks and other services to the visitors. He also imagined the impressive strong room which could be accessed by a lift bridge, over two-meters-deep moats.&lt;ref&gt;Historical study on the Hotel Gaillard, led by the ''Groupe de Recherche Art Histoire Architecture et Littérature'' (GRAHAL), on request of the Banque de France.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hôtel Gaillard - Cité de l'économie et de la monnaie - travaux Grand Hall 2.jpg|thumb|alt=Grand Lobby construction|Grand Lobby construction works, conceived by the architect Alphonse Defrasse, 1921]]

Listed as a historic monument in 1999, this branch closed in 2006, as a consequence of the plan to close half of the [[Banque de France]]'s branches on the French territory.

==The architectural contest==

The project of the Cité de l'économie et de la monnaie was the object of an architectural contest. Over 100 teams of architects and museographers have participated in this contest which aimed at transforming this former branch of the Banque de France in an educational Cité, while respecting the architecture of the building which is listed as historic monument.

The team of architects – museographers was selected by the [[Banque de France]] amongst the six final projects chosen by the jury of the contest. The team is made of Ateliers Lion for the architecture, François Confino for the museography, and Eric Pallot as architect in charge of historic monuments.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.banque-france.fr/fr/instit/telechar/communiques/dossier-presse-CEM.pdf Press kit: Cité de l'économie et de la monnaie.]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Climate ethics''' is an area of research that focuses on the ethical dimensions of climate change (also known as [[global warming]]), and concepts such as [[climate justice]].

Human-induced climate change raises many profound [[Ethics|ethical]] questions, yet many {{Who||date=February 2012}} believe that these ethical issues have not been addressed adequately in climate change policy debates or in the scientific and economic literature on climate change; and that, consequently, ethical questions are being overlooked or obscured in climate negotiations, policies and discussions . It has been pointed out that those most responsible for climate change are not the same people as those most vulnerable to its effects.

Terms such as [[climate justice]] and ecological justice ('eco justice') are used worldwide, and have been adopted by various organizations.

== Overview ==

An article in the scientific journal ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' (Patz, 2005)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]|title=Impact of regional climate change on human health|volume=438|pages=310–317|date=17 November 2005|doi=10.1038/nature04188|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v438/n7066/full/nature04188.html|first1=Jonathan A|last1=Patz|first2=Diarmid|last2=Campbell-Lendrum|first3=Tracey|last3=Holloway|first4=Jonathan A|last4=Foley|bibcode=2005Natur.438..310P}}&lt;/ref&gt; concluded that the human-induced warming that the world is now experiencing is already causing 150,000 deaths and 5 million incidents of disease each year from additional [[malaria]] and [[diarrhea]], mostly in the poorest nations.  Death and disease incidents are likely to soar as warming increases. Facts such as this demonstrate that climate change is compromising rights to life, liberty and personal security.  Hence, ethical analysis of climate change policy must examine how that policy  impacts on those basic rights.

Climate change raises a number of particularly challenging ethical issues about [[distributive justice]], in particular concerning how to fairly share the benefits and burdens of climate change policy options. Many of the policy tools often employed to solve environmental problems such as [[cost-benefit analysis]] usually do not adequately deal with these issues because they often ignore questions of just distribution.

== ''Collaborative Program on the Ethical Dimensions of Climate Change'' ==

In December 2004 in Buenos Aires, Argentina, the ''Collaborative Program on the Ethical Dimensions of Climate Change'' was launched at the 10th Conference of Parties to the [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change]].  The major outcome of this meeting was the Buenos Aires Declaration on the Ethical Dimensions of Climate Change.

===Objectives===
The program on the Ethical Dimensions of Climate Change seeks to:
*Facilitate express examination of ethical dimensions of climate change particularly for those issues entailed by specific positions taken by governments, businesses, NGOs, organizations, or individuals on climate change policy matters;
*Create better understanding about the ethical dimensions of climate change among policy makers and the general public;
*Assure that people around the world, including those most vulnerable to climate change, participate in any ethical inquiry about responses to climate change;
*Develop an interdisciplinary approach to inquiry about the ethical dimensions of climate change and support publications that examine the ethical dimensions of climate change;
*Make the results of scholarship on the ethical dimensions of climate change available to and accessible to policy makers, scientists, and citizen groups;
*Integrate ethical analysis into the work of other institutions engaged in climate change policy including the Intergovernmental Program on Climate Change and the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Conference on Climate Change.

===Position===
Given the severity of impact to be expected and given the likelihood that some level of important disruptions in living conditions will occur for great numbers of people due to climate change events, this group contends that there is sufficient convergence among ethical principles to make a number of concrete recommendations on how governments should act, or identify ethical problems with positions taken by certain governments, organizations, or individuals.

Facts about climate change and fundamental human rights provide the starting point for climate ethics.

'''Coal pollution mitigation''', often referred to by the term '''clean coal''', is a series of systems and technologies that seek to mitigate the pollution and other environmental effects normally associated with the burning (though not the [[coal mining|mining]] or processing) of [[coal]], which is widely regarded as the dirtiest of the common fuels for industrial processes and power generation.&lt;ref name="NatGeoMyth"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2014/04/coal/nijhuis-text|title=Can Coal Ever Be Clean?|last=Nijhuis|first=Michelle|date=April 2014|publisher=[[National Geographic Society|National Geographic]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Approaches attempt to mitigate emissions of [[carbon dioxide]] (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and other [[greenhouse gas]]es, and [[naturally occurring radioactive material|radioactive material]]s, that arise from the use of coal, mainly for electrical power generation, using [[Coal pollution mitigation technology|various technologies]]. Historical efforts to reduce coal pollution focused on [[flue-gas desulfurization]] starting in the 1850s and clean burn technologies.  These efforts have been very successful in countries with strong environmental regulation, such as the US, where emissions of acid-rain causing compounds and particulates have been reduced by up to 90%&lt;ref&gt;https://www3.epa.gov/airmarkets/progress/reports/index.html&lt;/ref&gt; since 1995. More recent developments include [[carbon capture and storage]], which pumps and stores CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions underground, and [[integrated gasification combined cycle]] (IGCC) involve [[coal gasification]], which provides a basis for increased efficiency and lower cost in capturing CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2009/TECH/07/13/carbon.capture.storage/ |title=Countries betting tech can clean up coal  – IB89005: Global Climate Change |publisher=CNN International |date=July 13, 2009 |accessdate=2009-07-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090718230924/http://edition.cnn.com/2009/TECH/07/13/carbon.capture.storage/ |archivedate=July 18, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ibtimes.com/articles/20090716/daily-wrap-july-16-energy.htm |publisher= International Business Times |title= Daily Wrap Up for July 16 – Energy |date= July 16, 2009 |accessdate=2009-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.theage.com.au/environment/divided-views-over-clean-coal-pilot-project-20090708-ddf5.html |publisher= The Age |title= Divided views over 'clean coal' pilot project |date= July 9, 2009 |accessdate=2009-07-17 | location=Melbourne | first=Adam | last=Morton}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,25738096-11949,00.html |publisher= The Australian |title= Make-or-break summit as G8 gamble on climate and economy  |date= July 6, 2009 |accessdate=2009-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.fossil.energy.gov/programs/powersystems/cleancoal/86-93program.html |title= The 1986–93 Clean Coal Technology Program |publisher= US Department of Energy|date= 21 April 2011 |accessdate=2011-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Of the 22 clean coal demonstration projects funded by the U.S. Department of Energy since 2003, none are in operation as of February 2017, having been abandoned or delayed due to capital budget overruns or discontinued because of excessive operating expenses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Clean Coal Power Initiative|url=https://energy.gov/fe/science-innovation/clean-coal-research/major-demonstrations/clean-coal-power-initiative|website=Energy.gov|publisher=U.S. Department of Energy Office of Fossil Energy|accessdate=26 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Regulations==
Since the 1970s, various policy and regulatory measures have driven coal pollution mitigation.  In the US, the [[Clean Air Act (United States)|Clean Air Act]] was the primary driving force in reducing particulate emissions and acid rain from coal combustion. As regulations have increased the demand for coal pollution mitigation technologies, costs have fallen and performance has improved.&lt;ref name=IEA_Coal&gt;{{cite web|title=Clean Coal Technologies: Accelerating Commercial and Policy Drivers for Deployment|url=https://www.iea.org/publications/freepublications/publication/Clean_Coal_CIAB_2008.pdf|website=www.iea.org|publisher=International Energy Agency}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The widespread deployment of pollution-control equipment to reduce [[sulphur dioxide]], NO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; and dust emissions is just one example that brought cleaner air to many countries. The desire to tackle rising CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions to address [[climate change]] later introduced [[Carbon capture and storage|Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS)]].&lt;ref name=IEA_Coal/&gt;

Within the United States, [[Carbon Capture and Storage]] technologies, also sometimes referred to as carbon capture and sequestration, are mainly being developed in response to regulations by the [[Environmental Protection Agency]]—most notably the [[Clean Air Act (United States)|Clean Air Act]]—and in anticipation of legislation that seeks to mitigate [[climate change]].

[[Loan guarantees]] and [[tax incentives]] have a long history of use in [[Australia]], [[Member state of the European Union|EU countries]] and the US to encourage the introduction of coal pollution mitigation and other technologies to reduce environmental impact.&lt;ref name=IEA_Coal/&gt;

==Environmental impact of coal==
{{See also|Environmental impact of the coal industry}}

=== Greenhouse gasses ===
{{main|Greenhouse gas}}

Combustion of coal--which is mostly carbon--produces carbon dioxide as a product of combustion.  According to the [[United Nations]] [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]], the burning of coal, a [[fossil fuel]], is a significant contributor to [[global warming]]. (See the UN [[IPCC Fourth Assessment Report]]). For 1 ton of coal burned, 2.86 tons of carbon dioxide is created.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eia.gov/coal/production/quarterly/co2_article/co2.html|title= Carbon Dioxide Emission Factors for Coal, Energy Information Administration, Quarterly Coal Report, January–April 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Carbon sequestration]] technology has yet to be tested on a large scale and may not be safe or successful. Sequestered CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; may eventually leak up through the ground, may lead to unexpected geological instability or may cause contamination of aquifers used for drinking water supplies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.awwa.org/publications/MainStreamArticle.cfm?itemnumber=39815 | title=AWWA warns Congress about {{CO2}} injection concerns | publisher=American Water Works }}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As 25.5% of the world's electrical generation in 2004 was from coal-fired generation (see [[world energy consumption]]), reaching the carbon dioxide reduction targets of the [[Kyoto Protocol]] will require modifications to how coal is used.&lt;ref name="ncseonline.org"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ncseonline.org/NLE/CRSreports/Climate/clim-2.cfm?&amp;CFID=1255395&amp;CFTOKEN=96369856 |title= CRS Issue Brief for Congress – IB89005: Global Climate Change |publisher= National Council for Science and the Environment |date= August 13, 2001 |accessdate= 2008-09-13 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081226020613/http://www.ncseonline.org/NLE/CRSreports/Climate/clim-2.cfm?&amp;CFID=1255395&amp;CFTOKEN=96369856 |archivedate= December 26, 2008 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Combustion By-products===
By-products of coal combustion are compounds which are released into the atmosphere as a result of burning coal.  Coal includes contaminants such as sulfur compounds and non-combustible minerals.  When coal is burned, the minerals become ash (i.e [[particulate matter]] or PM) and the sulfur forms sulfur dioxide (SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;).  Since air is mostly [[nitrogen]], combustion of coal often leads to production of [[nitrogen oxide]]s. [[Sulfur  dioxide]] and [[nitrogen oxide]]s are primary causes of [[acid rain]].  For many years--before greenhouse gasses were widely understood to be a threat-- it was thought that these by-products were the only drawback to using coal.  These by-products are still a problem, but they have been greatly diminished in most advanced countries due to clean air regulations.
It is possible to remove most of the sulfur dioxide (SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), [[nitrogen oxide]]s (NO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;), and [[Particulates|particulate matter]] (PM) emissions from the coal-burning process.   For example, various techniques are used in a [[coal preparation plant]] to reduce the amount of non-combustible matter (i.e. ash) in the coal prior to burning.  During combustion, [[fluidized bed combustion]] is used to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions.  After burning, particulate matter (i.e. ash and dust) can be reduced using an [[electrostatic precipitator]] and sulfur dioxide emissions can be further reduced with [[Flue-gas desulfurization]].  Trace amounts of [[radionuclide]]s are more difficult to remove.{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}}

Coal-fired power plants are the largest aggregate source of the toxic heavy metal [[mercury (element)|mercury]]: 50 tons per year come from coal power plants out of 150 tons emitted nationally in the USA and 5000 tons globally. However, according to the United States Geological Survey, the trace amounts of mercury in coal by-products do not pose a threat to public health.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ornl.gov/info/ornlreview/rev26-34/text/colmain.html |publisher=Oak Ridge National Laboratory |title=Coal Combustion: Nuclear Resource or Danger? |author=Alex Gabbard |accessdate=2008-08-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070205103749/http://www.ornl.gov/info/ornlreview/rev26-34/text/colmain.html |archivedate=2007-02-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A study in 2013 found that Mercury found in the fish in the Pacific Ocean could possibly be linked to coal-fired plants in Asia.

==Potential financial impact==
Whether carbon capture and storage technology is adopted worldwide will “…depend less on science than on economics. Cleaning coal is very expensive.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB123751110892790871|title=Coal Hard Facts: Cleaning It Won't Be Dirt Cheap|last=Ball|first=Jeffrey|date=2009-03-20|website=The Wall Street Journal|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cost of converting a single coal-fired power plant===
Conversion of a conventional coal-fired power plant is done by injecting the {{CO2}} into [[ammonium carbonate]] after which it is then transported and deposited underground (preferably in soil beneath the sea).&lt;ref name="Can coal ever be clean"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2014/04/coal/nijhuis-text|title=Can Coal Ever Be Clean?|last=Nijhuis|first=Michelle|date=April 2014|website=National Geographic|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This injection process however is by far the most expensive. Besides the cost of the equipment and the ammonium carbonate, the coal-fired power plant also needs to use 30% of its generated heat to do the injection (parasitic load). A test-setup has been done in the American Electric Power Mountaineer coal-burning power plant.

One solution to reduce this thermal loss/parasitic load is to burn the pulverised load with [[pure oxygen]] instead of air.&lt;ref name="Can coal ever be clean"/&gt;

===Cost implications for new coal-fired power plants===
Newly built coal-fired power plants can be made to immediately use gasification of the coal prior to combustion. This makes it much easier to separate off the {{CO2}} from the exhaust fumes, making the process cheaper. This gasification process is done in new coal-burning power plants such as the coal-burning power plant at [[Tianjin]], called "[[GreenGen]]".

===Costs for US-wide conversion===
The projected nationwide costs for the implementing of carbon capture and storage (CCS) in coal-fired power plants in the USA (presumably using a conventional tactic, see above) can be found in the Wall Street Journal article. Credit Suisse Group says $15 billion needs to be invested in CCS over the next 10 years for it to play an important role in climate change. The [[International Energy Agency]] says $20 billion is needed. The [[Pew Center on Global Climate Change]] says the number is as high as $30 billion. Those figures dwarf the actual investments to date.

In the US, the Bush administration spent about $2.5 billion on [[Coal pollution mitigation technology|a range of mitigation technologies]] — a large amount, but far less than the amounts previously suggested. CCS proponents say both the government and the private sector need to step up their investments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.usnews.com/articles/news/energy/2009/03/17/why-clean-coal-is-years-away.html?PageNr=1|title=US News, Why clean coal is years away|last=|first=|date=2009-03-17|newspaper=US News|access-date=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090329044452/http://www.usnews.com/articles/news/energy/2009/03/17/why-clean-coal-is-years-away.html?PageNr=1|archive-date=2009-03-29|dead-url=yes|work=|via=|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Potential financial benefits ===
The coal industry in the US has the potential to make billions of dollars if clean coal technologies are pursued. It is estimated that from 2000 to 2020 the industry could make up to $15 billion in reduced fuel costs, $25 billion in avoided environmental costs, and $32 billion from exporting the equipment and licensing for use in other countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bezdek|first=Roger H.|last2=Wendling|first2=Robert M.|date=2013-03-01|title=The return on investment of the clean coal technology program in the USA|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301421512009615|journal=Energy Policy|series=Decades of Diesel|volume=54|pages=104–112|doi=10.1016/j.enpol.2012.10.076}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political support==
{{Expand section|cover more countries' viewpoints|date=February 2017}}

=== Australia ===
In Australia, carbon capture and storage was often referred to by then [[Prime Minister of Australia|Prime Minister]] [[Kevin Rudd]] as a possible way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. (The previous [[Prime Minister of Australia|Prime Minister]] [[John Howard]] had stated that [[nuclear power]] was a better alternative, as CCS technology may not prove to be economically feasible.)

=== Canada ===
In 2014 SaskPower a provincial-owned electric utility finished renovations on Boundary Dam’s boiler number 3 making it the worlds first post-combustion carbon capture storage facility.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://energyblog.nationalgeographic.com/2014/10/02/worlds-first-full-scale-clean-coal-plant-opens-in-canada/|title=World’s First Full-Scale ‘Clean’ Coal Plant Opens in Canada|last=Danko|first=Pete|date=2014-10-02|access-date=2017-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The renovation project ended up costing a little over $1.2 billion and can scrub out CO2 and other toxin from up to 90 percent of the flue gas that it emits.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Since 2006, China keeps releasing more {{CO2}} than [[List of countries by carbon dioxide emissions|any other country]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/25/business/china-davos-climate-change.html|title=China’s Emissions: More Than U.S. Plus Europe, and Still Rising|website=[[The New York Times]]|language=en|date=2018-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/chinese-coal-fuels-rise-in-global-carbon-emissions-2j0kvrd2z|title=Chinese coal fuels rise in global carbon emissions|website=[[The Times]]|language=en|date=2017-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/rrapier/2017/10/24/yes-the-u-s-leads-all-countries-in-reducing-carbon-emissions/#69229dfc3535|title=Yes, The U.S. Leads All Countries In Reducing Carbon Emissions|website=[[Forbes]]|language=en|date=2017-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2011/jan/31/world-carbon-dioxide-emissions-country-data-co2|title=World carbon dioxide emissions data by country: China speeds ahead of the rest|website=[[The Guardian]]|language=en|date=2011-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pbl.nl/en/dossiers/Climatechange/Chinanowno1inCO2emissionsUSAinsecondposition|title=China now no. 1 in CO2 emissions; USA in second position|website=PBL [[Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency]]|language=en|date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers in China are focusing on increasing efficiency of burning coal so they can get more power out of less coal.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/2101780-chinas-drive-to-clean-up-its-coal-power-one-plant-at-a-time/|title=China’s drive to clean up its coal power, one plant at a time|work=New Scientist|access-date=2017-05-04|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is estimated that new high efficiency power plants could reduce CO2 emission by 7% because they won't have to burn as much coal to get the same amount of power.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Japan ===
Following the [[Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster|catastrophic failure of the Fukushima I Nuclear Power Plant]] in Japan that resulted from the [[2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami]], and the [[Japanese reaction to Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster|subsequent widespread public opposition against nuclear power]], high energy, lower emission (HELE) coal power plants were increasingly favored by the [[Shinzō Abe]]-led government to recoup lost energy capacity from the partial shutdown of nuclear power plants in Japan and to replace aging coal and oil-fired power plants, while meeting 2030 emission targets of the [[Paris Agreement]]. 45 HELE power plants have been planned, purportedly to employ [[integrated gasification fuel cell cycle]], a further development of integrated gasification combined cycle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-01-31/japan-coal-power-plants/8224302|title=Japanese government planning to build 45 new coal fired power stations to diversify supply|last=McHugh|first=Babs|date=2017-02-23|access-date=2017-02-23|location=|newspaper=ABC Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-11-10/want-to-burn-coal-and-save-the-planet-japan-touts-a-solution|title=Want to Burn Coal and Save the Planet?

Japan had adopted prior pilot projects on IGCC coal power plants in the early-1990s and late-2000s.

=== United States ===
In the United States, "clean coal" was mentioned by former President [[George W. Bush]] on several occasions, including his 2007 [[State of the Union Address]]. Bush's position was that carbon capture and storage technologies should be encouraged as one means to reduce the country's dependence on foreign oil.

During the [[United States presidential election, 2008|US Presidential campaign for 2008]], both candidates [[John McCain]] and [[Barack Obama]] expressed interest in the development of CCS technologies as part of an overall comprehensive energy plan. The development of pollution mitigation technologies could also create export business for the United States or any other country working on it.

The [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009|American Reinvestment and Recovery Act]], signed in 2009 by President Obama, allocated $3.4 billion for advanced carbon capture and storage technologies, including demonstration projects.

Former Secretary of State [[Hillary Clinton]] has said that "we should strive to have new electricity generation come from other sources, such as clean coal and renewables,” and former Energy Secretary [[Steven Chu|Dr. Steven Chu]] has said that “It is absolutely worthwhile to invest in carbon capture and storage", noting that even if the U.S. and Europe turned their backs on coal, developing nations like India and China would likely not.

During the first [[United States presidential election debates, 2012|2012 United States presidential election debate]], [[Mitt Romney]] expressed his support for clean coal, and claimed that current federal policies were hampering the coal industry.&lt;ref name="npr2012-10-03"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/2012/10/03/162258551/transcript-first-obama-romney-presidential-debate|title=Transcript And Audio: First Obama-Romney Debate|date=2012-10-03|publisher=[[Federal News Service]]|website=[[NPR]]|accessdate=2013-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism of the approach==
Environmentalists such as [[Dan Becker]], director of the [[Sierra Club]]'s Global Warming and Energy Program, believes that the term "clean coal" is misleading: "There is no such thing as clean coal and there never will be. It's an [[oxymoron]]." The Sierra Club's Coal Campaign has launched a site refuting the clean coal statements and advertising of the coal industry.

Complaints focus on the environmental impacts of [[coal mining|coal extraction]], high costs to [[carbon capture and storage|sequester carbon]], and uncertainty of how to manage end result [[air pollution|pollutants]] and [[radionuclide]]s. In reference to sequestration of carbon, concerns exist about whether geologic storage of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in reservoirs, aquifers, ''etc.'', is indefinite/permanent.

The palaeontologist and influential environmental activist [[Tim Flannery]] made the assertion that the concept of clean coal might not be viable for all geographical locations.

Critics also believe that the continuing construction of coal-powered plants (whether or not they use carbon sequestration techniques) encourages unsustainable mining practices for coal, which can strip away mountains, hillsides, and natural areas. They also point out that there can be a large amount of energy required and pollution emitted in transporting the coal to the power plants.

[[The Climate Reality Project|The Reality Coalition]], a US non-profit climate organization composed of the Alliance for Climate Protection, the [[Sierra Club]], the [[National Wildlife Federation]], the [[Natural Resources Defense Council]] and the [[League of Conservation Voters]], ran a series of television commercials in 2008 and 2009. The commercials were highly critical of attempts to mitigate coal's pollution, stating that without capturing CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions and storing it safely that it cannot be called "clean coal".

[[Greenpeace]] is a major opponent of the concept, because they view emissions and wastes as not being avoided but instead transferred from one [[waste stream]] to another. According to [[Greenpeace USA]]'s Executive Director [[Phil Radford]] speaking in 2012, "even the industry figures it will take 10 or 20 years to arrive, and we need solutions sooner than that. We need to scale up renewable energy; “clean coal” is a distraction from that."

== Clean coal ==
The term Clean Coal in modern society often refers to the [[carbon capture and storage]] process. The term has been used by advertisers, lobbyists, and politicians such as  [[Donald Trump]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Conditt|first=Jessica|date=March 30, 2017|title=Dear Donald Trump: 'Clean coal' doesn't exist|url=https://www.engadget.com/2017/03/30/clean-coal-myth-trump-carbon-capture-energy-no/|accessdate=2017-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prior terminology===
The industry term "clean coal" is increasingly used in reference to carbon capture and storage, an advanced theoretical process that would eliminate or significantly reduce carbon dioxide emissions from coal-based plants and permanently sequester them. More generally, the term has been found in modern usage to describe technologies designed to enhance both the efficiency and the environmental acceptability of coal extraction, preparation, and use.

U.S. Senate Bill 911 in April, 1987, defined clean coal technology as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"The term clean coal technology means any technology...deployed at a new or existing facility which will achieve significant reductions in air emissions of sulfur dioxide or oxides of nitrogen associated with the utilization of coal in the generation of electricity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://behindtheplug.americaspower.org/2009/03/the-definition-of-clean-coal.html|title=The definition of clean coal «  Behind The Plug|publisher=|access-date=2012-08-28|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130221052204/http://behindtheplug.americaspower.org/2009/03/the-definition-of-clean-coal.html|archive-date=2013-02-21|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Before being adopted in this fashion, historically "clean coal" was used to refer to clean-burning coal with low levels of impurities, though this term faded after rates of domestic coal usage dropped. The term appeared in a speech to mine workers in 1918, in context indicating coal that was "free of dirt and impurities."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://atomicinsights.com/2007/03/clean-coal-history-lesson.html |title="Clean coal" history lesson |access-date=2012-08-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120831064249/http://atomicinsights.com/2007/03/clean-coal-history-lesson.html |archive-date=2012-08-31 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 20th century, prior to World War II, clean coal (also called "smokeless coal") generally referred to [[anthracite]] and high-grade [[bituminous coal]], used for cooking and home heating.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wva-usa.com/history/mthope/smokeless.php "Smokeless Coal,"] WVa-USA.com, accessed May 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26289">In [[cognitive linguistics]], '''conceptual metaphor''', or '''cognitive metaphor''', refers to the understanding of one idea, or [[Conceptual framework|conceptual domain]], in terms of another. An example of this is the understanding of [[quantity]] in terms of [[Direction (geometry)|directionality]] (e.g. "the price of peace is ''rising''") or the understanding of time in terms of money (e.g. "I ''spent'' time at work today").

A conceptual domain can be any coherent organization of human experience. The regularity with which different languages employ the same metaphors, which often appear to be perceptually based, has led to the hypothesis that the mapping between conceptual domains corresponds to neural mappings in the brain.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. Feldman, J. and Narayanan, S. (2004). Embodied meaning in a neural theory of language. ''Brain and Language'', 89(2):385–392&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=du Castel|first1=Bertrand|title=Pattern Activation/Recognition Theory of Mind|journal=Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience|volume=9|issue=90|publisher=EPFL|location=Lausanne|date = 15 July 2015|url=http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fncom.2015.00090/full|doi=10.3389/fncom.2015.00090|ref=neuroscience}}&lt;/ref&gt; This theory has gained wide attention, although some researchers question its empirical accuracy.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. Madsen, M.W. (2016). Cognitive Metaphor Theory and the Metaphysics of Immediacy. ''Cognitive Science'', 40(4):881–908&lt;/ref&gt; 

This idea, and a detailed examination of the underlying processes, was first extensively explored by [[George Lakoff]] and [[Mark Johnson (professor)|Mark Johnson]] in their work ''Metaphors We Live By'' in 1980. Since then, the field of metaphor studies within the larger discipline of [[Cognitive linguistics|Cognitive Linguistics]] has increasingly developed, with several, annual academic conferences, scholarly societies, and research labs contributing to the subject area. Some researchers, such as Gerard Steen, have worked to develop empirical investigative tools for metaphor research, including the [[Metaphor identification procedure|Metaphor Identification Procedure]], or MIP.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/650090590|title=A method for linguistic metaphor identification : from MIP to MIPVU|date=2010|publisher=John Benjamins Pub. Co|others=Steen, Gerard.|isbn=9789027288158|location=Amsterdam|oclc=650090590}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Psychology, [[Raymond W. Gibbs Jr.|Raymond W. Gibbs, Jr.]], has investigated conceptual metaphor and [[Embodied cognition|embodiment]] through a number of psychological experiments. Other [[Cognitive science|cognitive scientists]], for example [[Gilles Fauconnier]], study subjects similar to conceptual metaphor under the labels "[[analogy]]", "[[conceptual blending]]" and "[[ideasthesia]]".

Conceptual metaphors are seen in language in our everyday lives. Conceptual metaphors shape not just our communication, but also shape the way we think and act. In George Lakoff and Mark Johnson's work, ''Metaphors We Live By'' (1980), we see how everyday language is filled with metaphors we may not always notice. An example of one of the commonly used conceptual metaphors is "argument is war".&lt;ref&gt;Lakoff and Johnson, Ch.1-3&lt;/ref&gt;  This metaphor shapes our language in the way we view argument as war or as a battle to be won. It is not uncommon to hear someone say "He won that argument" or "I attacked every weak point in his argument". The very way argument is thought of is shaped by this metaphor of arguments being war and battles that must be won. Argument can be seen in other ways than a battle, but we use this concept to shape the way we think of argument and the way we go about arguing.

Conceptual metaphors are used very often to understand theories and models. A conceptual metaphor uses one idea and links it to another to better understand something. For example, the conceptual metaphor of viewing communication as a [[Conduit metaphor|conduit]] is one large theory explained with a metaphor. So not only is our everyday communication shaped by the language of conceptual metaphors, but so is the very way we understand scholarly theories. These metaphors are prevalent in communication and we do not just use them in language; we actually perceive and act in accordance with the metaphors.

== Historical accounts of metaphor ==

=== In antiquity ===
In the Western philosophical tradition, [[Aristotle]] is often situated as the first commentator on the nature of metaphor, writing in the ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'', "A 'metaphorical term' involves the transferred use of a term that properly belongs to something else,"&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle. ''Poetics''.English text: D.A. Russell and M. Winterbottom (eds.), in ''Ancient Literary Criticism: The Principal Texts in New Translation.'' Oxford: Oxford UP, 1972.&lt;/ref&gt; and elsewhere in the ''[[Rhetoric (Aristotle)|Rhetoric]]'' he says that metaphors make learning pleasant; "To learn easily is naturally pleasant to all people, and words signify something, so whatever words create knowledge in us are the pleasantest."&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, W. Rhys Roberts, Ingram Bywater, and Friedrich Solmsen. Rhetoric. New York: Modern Library, 1954. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle's writings on metaphor constitute a "substitution view" of metaphor, wherein a metaphor is simply a decorative word or phrase substituted for a more ordinary one. This has been sometimes called the "Traditional View of Metaphor"&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Soskice, Janet. ''Metaphor and Religious Language''. Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1985.&lt;/ref&gt; and at other times the "Classical Theory of Metaphor".&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Lakoff, George and Mark Johnson. ''Metaphors We Live By''. Chicago: Chicago UP, 1980.&lt;/ref&gt; Later in the first century A.D., the Roman rhetorician [[Quintilian]] builds upon Aristotle's earlier work  of metaphor by focusing more on the comparative function of metaphorical language. In his work ''[[Institutio Oratoria]],'' Quintilian states," In totum autem metaphora brevior est similitudo" or "on the whole, metaphor is a shorter form of simile".&lt;ref&gt;Quintilian. ''Institutio Oratoria''. Trans. H.E. Butler. London: William Heinemann, 1921. Vol. III.&lt;/ref&gt; Modern interpretations of these early theories have also been intensely debated. [[Janet Soskice]], Professor of [[Philosophical theology|Philosophical Theology]] at the [[University of Cambridge]], writes in summary that "it is certain that we shall taste the freshness of their insights only if we free them from the obligation to answer questions that were never theirs to ask".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; George Lakoff and Mark Johnson, although originally taking a hard-line interpretation of these early authors&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wood, Matthew S. "Aristotle's Theory of Metaphor Revisited." ''Mouseion: Journal of the&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Classical Association of Canada'', 14.1 (2017): 63-90. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; later concede that Aristotle was working within a different philosophical framework from what we engage with today and that critical interpretations should take this in to account.&lt;ref&gt;Lakoff, George, and Mark Johnson. ''Philosophy in the Flesh: The Embodied Mind and Its Challenge to Western Philosophy''. New York: Basic Books, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mappings ==
There are two main roles for the conceptual domains posited in conceptual metaphors:
*'''Source domain''': the conceptual domain from which we draw metaphorical expressions (e.g., love is a ''journey'').
*'''Target domain''': the conceptual domain that we try to understand (e.g., ''love'' is a journey).

A '''mapping''' is the systematic set of correspondences that exist between constituent elements of the source and the target domain. Many elements of target concepts come from source domains and are not preexisting.  To know a conceptual metaphor is to know the set of mappings that applies to a given source-target pairing. The same idea of mapping between source and target is used to describe [[analogy|analogical]] reasoning and inferences.&lt;ref&gt;Kövecses, Zoltan (2010) ''Metaphor: A Practical Introduction''&lt;/ref&gt;

A primary tenet of this theory is that metaphors are matter of thought and not merely of language: hence, the term ''conceptual metaphor''.  The metaphor may seem to consist of words or other linguistic expressions that come from the terminology of the more concrete conceptual domain, but conceptual metaphors underlie a system of related metaphorical expressions that appear on the linguistic surface.  Similarly, the mappings of a conceptual metaphor are themselves motivated by [[image schema]]s which are pre-linguistic schemas concerning space, time, moving, controlling, and other core elements of embodied human experience.

Conceptual metaphors typically employ a more abstract concept as target and a more concrete or physical concept as their source.  For instance, metaphors such as 'the days [the more abstract or target concept] ahead' or 'giving my time' rely on more concrete concepts, thus expressing time as a path into physical space, or as a substance that can be handled and offered as a gift.  Different conceptual metaphors tend to be invoked when the speaker is trying to make a case for a certain point of view or course of action.  For instance, one might associate "the days ahead" with leadership, whereas the phrase "giving my time" carries stronger connotations of bargaining.  Selection of such metaphors tends to be directed by a subconscious or implicit habit in the mind of the person employing them.

The principle of unidirectionality states that the metaphorical process typically goes from the more concrete to the more abstract, and not the other way around.  Accordingly, abstract concepts are understood in terms of prototype concrete processes.  The term "concrete," in this theory, has been further specified by Lakoff and Johnson as more closely related to the developmental, physical neural, and interactive body (see [[embodied philosophy]]).  One manifestation of this view is found in the [[cognitive science of mathematics]], where it is proposed that mathematics itself, the most widely accepted means of abstraction in the human community, is largely metaphorically constructed, and thereby reflects a [[cognitive bias]] unique to humans that uses embodied prototypical processes (e.g. counting, moving along a path) that are understood by all human beings through their experiences.

== Conduit metaphor ==
The [[conduit metaphor]] is a dominant class of figurative expressions used when discussing communication itself ([[metalanguage]]). It operates whenever people speak or write as if they "insert" their [[Mental content|mental contents]] (feelings, meanings, thoughts, concepts, etc.) into "containers" (words, phrases, sentences, etc.) whose contents are then "extracted" by listeners and readers. Thus, language is viewed as a "conduit" conveying mental content between people.

Defined and described by linguist Michael J. Reddy, PhD, his proposal of this conceptual metaphor refocused debate within and outside the linguistic community on the importance of metaphorical language.&lt;ref&gt;Reddy, M. J. (1979). The conduit metaphor: A case of frame conflict in our language about language. In A. Ortony (Ed.), ''Metaphor and Thought''(pp. 284–310). Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|0-521-29626-9}} paperback&lt;/ref&gt;

== Language and culture as mappings ==

In their 1980 work, [[George Lakoff|Lakoff]] and [[Mark Johnson (philosopher)|Johnson]] closely examined a collection of basic conceptual metaphors, including:

*{{Smallcaps|{{lc:Love is a journey}}}}
*{{Smallcaps|{{lc:Life is a journey}}}}
*{{Smallcaps|{{lc:Social organizations are plants}}}}
*{{Smallcaps|{{lc:Love is war}}}}

The latter half of each of these phrases invokes certain assumptions about concrete experience and requires the reader or listener to apply them to the preceding abstract concepts of love or organizing in order to understand the sentence in which the conceptual metaphor is used.

There are numerous ways in which conceptual metaphors shape human perception and communication, especially in mass media and in public policy.

Lakoff and Johnson focus on English, and cognitive scholars writing in English have tended not to investigate the discourse of foreign languages in any great detail to determine the creative ways in which individuals negotiate, resist, and consolidate conceptual metaphors. [[Andrew Goatly]] in his book ''Washing the Brain'' (2007)&lt;ref name="washing the brain"&gt;{{cite book|title=Washing the Brain Metaphor and Hidden Ideology|last1=Goatly|first1=Andrew|date=January 17, 2007|publisher=[[John Benjamins Publishing Company]]|isbn=978-9027227133|authorlink1=Andrew Goatly}}&lt;!--| accessdate = 2012-06-04 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; considers ideological conceptual metaphors as well as Chinese conceptual metaphors.

James W. Underhill, a modern Humboldtian scholar, attempts to reestablish [[Wilhelm von Humboldt]]'s concern for the different ways languages frame reality, and the strategies individuals adopt in creatively resisting and modifying existing patterns of thought. Taking on board the Lakoff-Johnson paradigm of conceptual metaphor, he investigates the way in which Czech communists appropriated the concept of the people, the state and struggle, and the way German Communists harnessed concepts of eternity and purity. He also reminds us that, as Klemperer, the main critic of Hitlerdeutsch, demonstrates, resisting patterns of thought means engaging in conceptual metaphors and refusing the logic that ideologies impose upon them. In multilingual studies (based on Czech, German, French &amp; English), Underhill considers how different cultures reformulate key concepts such as truth, love, hate and war.&lt;ref&gt;'Ethnolinguistics and Cultural Concepts', Cambridge University Press 2012, and 'Creating Worldviews', Edinburgh University Press 2011.  {{ISBN|978-0748643158}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Family roles and ethics ==

A less extreme, but similar, claim is made by [[George Lakoff]] in his book ''[[Moral Politics]]'' and his later book on [[framing (social sciences)|framing]], ''[[Don't Think of an Elephant!]].'' Lakoff claims that the public political arena in America reflects a basic conceptual metaphor of '[[family|the family]].'  Accordingly, people understand political leaders in terms of 'strict father' and 'nurturant mother' roles.  Two basic views of [[political economy]] arise from this desire to see the nation-state act 'more like a father' or 'more like a mother.'  He further amplified these views in his latest book, ''[[The Political Mind]].''

Urban theorist and ethicist [[Jane Jacobs]] made this distinction in less gender-driven if not wholly desexualizing terms by differentiating between a 'Guardian Ethic' and a 'Trader Ethic'.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, J. 'Systems of Survival', Hodder and Stoughton, London, 1993. {{ISBN|0340591773}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  She states that guarding and trading are two concrete activities that human beings must learn to apply metaphorically to all choices in later life.  In a society where guarding children is the primary female duty and trading in a market economy is the primary male duty, Lakoff posits that children assign the 'guardian' and 'trader' roles to their mothers and fathers, respectively.

Both of these theories suggest that there may be a great deal of [[social conditioning]] and pressure to form specific [[cognitive bias]]. Anthropologists observe that all societies tend to have roles assigned by age and gender, which supports this view.

== Linguistics and politics ==

Lakoff and Jacobs both devote a significant amount of time to current events and political theory, suggesting that respected linguists and theorists of conceptual metaphor may tend to channel their theories into political activism.

Critics of this ethics-driven approach to language tend to accept that [[idiom]]s reflect underlying conceptual metaphors, but that actual grammar, and the more basic cross-cultural concepts of [[scientific method]] and [[mathematical practice]] tend to minimize the impact of metaphors.  Such critics tend to see Lakoff and Jacobs as 'left-wing figures,' and would not accept their politics as any kind of crusade against an [[ontology]] embedded in language and culture, but rather, as an idiosyncratic pastime, not part of the science of linguistics nor of much use.  And others further, such as [[Deleuze]] and [[Guattari]], [[Michel Foucault]] and, more recently, [[Manuel de Landa]] would criticize both of these two positions for mutually constituting the same old ontological ideology that would try to separate two parts of a whole that is greater than the sum of its parts.

Lakoff's 1987 work, ''[[Women, Fire, and Dangerous Things]],'' answered some of these criticisms before they were even made: he explores the effects of cognitive metaphors (both culturally specific and human-universal) on the grammar per se of several languages, and the evidence of the limitations of the classical logical-positivist or [[Analytic philosophy|Anglo-American School]] philosophical concept of the category usually used to explain or describe the scientific method. Lakoff's reliance on empirical scientific evidence, ''i.e.'' specifically [[falsifiability|falsifiable]] predictions, in the 1987 work and in ''[[Philosophy in the Flesh]]'' (1999) suggests that the cognitive-metaphor position has no objections to the scientific method, but instead considers the scientific method a finely developed reasoning system used to discover phenomena which are subsequently understood in terms of new conceptual metaphors (such as the metaphor of fluid motion for conducted electricity, which is described in terms of "current" "flowing" against "impedance," or the gravitational metaphor for static-electric phenomena, or the "planetary orbit" model of the atomic nucleus and electrons, as used by [[Niels Bohr]]).

Further, partly in response to such criticisms, Lakoff and [[Rafael E. Núñez]], in 2000, proposed a [[cognitive science of mathematics]] that would explain mathematics as a consequence of, not an alternative to, the human reliance on conceptual metaphor to understand abstraction in terms of basic experiential concretes.

==Literature==
The Linguistic Society of America has argued that "the most recent [[Linguistics|linguistic]] approach to [[literature]] is that of cognitive metaphor, which claims that metaphor is not a mode of language, but a mode of thought. Metaphors project structures from source domains of schematized bodily or enculturated experience into abstract target domains. We conceive the abstract idea of life in terms of our experiences of a journey, a year, or a day. We do not understand [[Robert Frost]]'s '[[Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening]]' to be about a horse-and-wagon journey but about life. We understand [[Emily Dickinson]]'s '[[Because I could not stop for Death]]' as a [[poem]] about the end of the human life span, not a trip in a carriage. This work is redefining the critical notion of [[imagery (literature)|imagery]]. Perhaps for this reason, cognitive metaphor has significant promise for some kind of rapprochement between [[linguistics]] and [[literary study]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lsadc.org/info/ling-fields-lit.cfm |title=LSA: About Linguistics |publisher=Lsadc.org |date= |accessdate=2012-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
Teaching thinking by analogy (metaphor) is one of the main themes of [[The Private Eye Project]].

The work of political scientist Rūta Kazlauskaitė examines metaphorical models in school-history knowledge of the controversial Polish-Lithuanian past. On the basis of Lakoff and Johnson's conceptual metaphor theory, she shows how the implicit metaphorical models of everyday experience, which inform the abstract conceptualization of the past, truth, objectivity, knowledge, and multiperspectivity in the school textbooks, obstruct an understanding of the divergent narratives of past experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://urn.fi/URN:ISBN:978-951-51-4181-1 |title="Towards an Embodied History: Metaphorical Models in Textbook Knowledge of the Controversial Polish-Lithuanian Past". Rūta Kazlauskaitė. Doctoral dissertation. University of Helsinki |date=2018-05-18 |accessdate=2018-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Language learning==
There is some evidence that an understanding of underlying conceptual metaphors can aid the retention of vocabulary for people learning a [[foreign language]].&lt;ref&gt;Boers, F. 'Metaphor awareness and vocabulary retention', Applied Linguistics 21(4) 2000: 553-571&lt;/ref&gt; To improve learners' awareness of conceptual metaphor, one [[monolingual learner's dictionary]], the [[Macmillan English Dictionary for Advanced Learners|Macmillan English Dictionary]] has introduced 50 or so 'metaphor boxes'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.macmillandictionaries.com/about/med/key-features-of-the-macmillan-english-dictionary-second-edition/#8 |title=MED Second Edition - Key features &amp;#124; Macmillan |publisher=Macmillandictionaries.com |date= |accessdate=2012-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; covering the most salient Lakoffian metaphors in English.&lt;ref&gt;Moon, R. 'On specifying metaphor: an idea and its implementation'. International Journal of Lexicography, 17(2) 2004: 195-222&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bejoint, H. The Lexicography of English, Oxford University Press 2010: 189&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the dictionary entry for ''conversation'' includes a box with the heading: 'A conversation is like a '''journey''', with the speakers going from one place to another', followed by vocabulary items (words and phrases) which embody this metaphorical schema.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.macmillandictionary.com/dictionary/british/conversation |title=conversation - definition of conversation by Macmillan Dictionary |publisher=Macmillandictionary.com |date= |accessdate=2012-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Language teaching experts are beginning to explore the relevance of conceptual metaphor to how learners learn and what teachers do in the classroom.&lt;ref&gt;Holme, Randal, Mind, Metaphor and Language Teaching. London: Palgrave 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conceptual metaphorical mapping in animals==
A current study showed a natural tendency to systematically map an abstract dimension, such as social status, in our closest and non-linguistic relatives, the chimpanzees.&lt;ref&gt;Dahl, C. D. and Adachi, I. 'Conceptual metaphorical mapping in chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes)', eLife 2013;2:e00932. DOI: 10.7554/eLife.00932&lt;/ref&gt; In detail, discrimination performances between familiar conspecific faces were systematically modulated by the spatial location and the social status of the presented individuals, leading to discrimination facilitation or deterioration. High-ranked individuals presented at spatially higher position and low-ranked individuals presented at lower position led to discrimination facilitation, while high-ranked individuals at lower positions and low-ranked individuals at higher position led to discrimination deterioration. This suggests that this tendency had already evolved in the common ancestors of humans and chimpanzees and is not uniquely human, but describes a conceptual metaphorical mapping that predates language.

In The [[United States]] [[criminal justice system]], a '''Courtroom Workgroup''' is an informal arrangement between a criminal [[prosecutor]], [[criminal defense attorney]], and the [[judicial officer]]. This foundational concept in the academic discipline of [[criminal justice]] recharacterizes the seemingly adversarial courtroom participants as collaborators in "doing justice." The courtroom workgroup was proposed by Eisenstein and Jacob in 1977 to explain their observations of the ways courts, especially lower level courts, actually come to decisions.

Because the courtroom workgroup deviates from the public consensus of how justice works, it has developed a deviant set of rules to continue its work and facilitate daily life for its participants. The academic theory of the courtroom workgroup has four cornerstone concepts that recognize this fact: Speed, Pragmatic Cynicism, Collegiality, and Secrecy. Efficient courtroom workgroups seek to process cases rather than dispense justice. This has been confirmed to greater and lesser extents in different courts.  [[Defendant]]s are assumed to be guilty. The procedural merits of the case are the true determinative factors of an outcome. Prosecutors and defense attorneys engage in a comparison of charges against possible procedural flaws and possible defenses to arrive at the going rate for a crime.  These factors are used to determine how much punishment the plea bargain will offer.  For example, group relationships and the desire to "maintain" a healthy working relationship are important to group members. The workings of the courtroom group and the "going rate" for given crimes are not matters for public disclosure. Estimates can be given to clients, but usually couched in terms of the prosecution's willingness to negotiate. (Summarized by O'Connor, T.R., 2005)

The courtroom workgroup is a mechanism for [[prosecutorial discretion]].  Various techniques are used to convince the defendant that the evidence against him or her is overwhelming.  “Charge stacking” is a process by which police and prosecutors create a case with numerous charges or numerous instances of the same charge to convince the defendant that the risk of not pleading guilty is intolerable.  The defendant may be convinced to plead guilty to a few of the charges in return for not being prosecuted for the remaining charges.

The courtroom workgroup is, in some sense, a response to a lack of resources for public defenders.  Defense attorneys in public defender offices often do not have sufficient time to prepare a case in detail for all of their clients.  Further, they often do not have the budget to fully investigate the facts of a case through either staff or private investigators.  They often must rely solely on police reports for such information.  In some jurisdictions, clients do not meet their attorneys until they are in court.  Typically, public defenders will meet briefly with clients in holding facilities or jails.  The defense attorney defends his or her client by seeking less punishment.  Huemann (1977) indicates that many defense attorneys feel pressured to keep up with their caseloads.  This pressure can manifest in the courtroom through rebukes by the judge for delays.  Many subtle pressures combine to encourage participation in the courtroom workgroup.

The concept of a courtroom workgroup is associated with plea bargaining. The courtroom workgroup shows remarkable explanatory power in overburdened courts dealing with large caseloads.  The courtroom workgroup model is best suited to explain jurisdictions where defense attorneys are more or less permanently assigned, but even occasionally appointed lawyers can participate in these practices. While many of the higher level prosecutions still follow the adversarial model, there is evidence that lower-level proceedings follow the courtroom workgroup model. Boland, Brady, Tyson, &amp; Bassler (1983) indicate that approximately 90 percent of criminal cases are settled by plea bargain. This figure appears to be stable over the last twenty years (Rainville &amp; Reaves, 2003). Some collaborative efforts on the part of the courtroom workgroup simply must be present to facilitate this high percentage of pleas.

A '''density matrix''' is a [[matrix (math)|matrix]] that describes the statistical state of a system in [[quantum mechanics]]. The density matrix is especially helpful for dealing with ''mixed states'', which consist of a [[statistical ensemble]] of several different quantum systems. The opposite of a mixed state is a [[pure state]]. [[Quantum state|State vectors]], also called [[bra-ket notation|kets]], describe only pure states, whereas a density matrix can describe both pure and mixed states.

Describing a quantum state by its density matrix is a fully general alternative formalism to describing a quantum state by its ket (state vector) or by its statistical ensemble of kets. However, in practice, it is often most convenient to use density matrices for calculations involving mixed states, and to use kets for calculations involving only pure states.

The density matrix is the quantum-mechanical analogue to a [[phase space|phase-space]] [[probability measure]] (probability distribution of position and momentum) in classical [[statistical mechanics]].

Mixed states arise in situations where the experimenter does not know which particular states are being manipulated. Examples include a [[canonical ensemble|system in thermal equilibrium]] at a temperature above [[absolute zero]], or a system with an uncertain or randomly varying preparation history (so one does not know which pure state the system is in). Also, if a quantum system has two or more subsystems that are [[Quantum entanglement|entangled]], then each subsystem must be treated as a mixed state even if the complete system is in a pure state.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Hall |first = B.C. |title = Quantum Theory for Mathematicians |volume = 267 | page = 419 | year = 2013|doi=10.1007/978-1-4614-7116-5|isbn=978-1-4614-7115-8|series=Graduate Texts in Mathematics|publisher=Springer}}&lt;/ref&gt; The density matrix is also a crucial tool in [[quantum decoherence]] theory.

The density matrix is a representation of a [[linear operator]] called the '''density operator'''. The density matrix is obtained from the density operator by choice of [[basis (linear algebra)|basis]] in the underlying space. In practice, the terms ''density matrix'' and ''density operator'' are often used interchangeably. Both matrix and operator are [[self-adjoint]] (or [[Hermitian matrix|Hermitian]]),  [[positive-semidefinite matrix|positive semi-definite]], of [[trace class|trace]] one, and  may
be [[Dimension (vector space)|infinite-dimensional]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last =  Fano | first = Ugo | authorlink = Ugo Fano | year = 1957 | title = Description of States in Quantum Mechanics by Density Matrix and Operator Techniques | journal =  Reviews of Modern Physics | volume = 29 | pages = 74–93| doi =10.1103/RevModPhys.29.74 | postscript =  . | bibcode=1957RvMP...29...74F}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Pure and mixed states ==
In [[mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics#Mathematical structure of quantum mechanics|quantum mechanics]], the state of a quantum system is represented by a [[quantum state|state vector]], denoted &lt;math&gt;| \psi \rangle &lt;/math&gt; (and pronounced ''[[bra–ket notation|ket]]''). A quantum system with a state vector &lt;math&gt;| \psi \rangle &lt;/math&gt; is called a ''pure state''. However, it is also possible for a system to be in a [[statistical ensemble]] of different state vectors: For example, there may be a 50% probability that the state vector is &lt;math&gt;| \psi_1 \rangle &lt;/math&gt; and a 50% chance that the state vector is &lt;math&gt;| \psi_2 \rangle &lt;/math&gt;. This system would be in a ''mixed state''. The density matrix is especially useful for mixed states, because any state, pure or mixed, can be characterized by a single density matrix.

A mixed state is different from a [[quantum superposition]]. The probabilities in a mixed state are classical probabilities (as in the probabilities one learns in classic probability theory / statistics), unlike the quantum probabilities in a quantum superposition.  In fact, a quantum superposition of pure states is another pure state, for example &lt;math&gt;| \psi \rangle = (| \psi_1 \rangle + | \psi_2 \rangle)/\sqrt{2} &lt;/math&gt;. In this case, the coefficients &lt;math&gt;1/\sqrt{2}&lt;/math&gt; are not probabilities, but rather [[probability amplitude]]s.

=== Example: light polarization ===
[[File:vertical polarization.svg|right|thumb|200px|The incandescent light bulb (1) emits completely random polarized  photons (2)  with mixed state density matrix&lt;br /&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix}
 0.5 &amp; 0  \\
 0 &amp; 0.5  \\
\end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt; &lt;span style="vertical-align:bottom"&gt;。&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After passing through vertical plane polarizer (3), the remaining photons are all vertically polarized (4) and have pure state density matrix&lt;br /&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix}
 1 &amp; 0  \\
 0 &amp; 0  \\
\end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt; &lt;span style="vertical-align:bottom"&gt;。&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/center&gt;]]
An example of pure and mixed states is [[light polarization]]. Photons can have two [[circular polarization|helicities]], corresponding to two orthogonal quantum states, &lt;math&gt;|R\rangle&lt;/math&gt; (right [[circular polarization]]) and &lt;math&gt;|L\rangle&lt;/math&gt; (left [[circular polarization]]). A photon can also be in a superposition state, such as &lt;math&gt;(|R\rangle+|L\rangle)/\sqrt{2}&lt;/math&gt; (vertical polarization) or &lt;math&gt;(|R\rangle-|L\rangle)/\sqrt{2}&lt;/math&gt; (horizontal polarization). More generally, it can be in any state &lt;math&gt;\alpha|R\rangle+\beta|L\rangle&lt;/math&gt; (with &lt;math&gt;|\alpha|^2+|\beta|^2=1&lt;/math&gt;), corresponding to [[linear polarization|linear]], [[circular polarization|circular]], or [[elliptical polarization]]. If we pass &lt;math&gt;(|R\rangle+|L\rangle)/\sqrt{2}&lt;/math&gt; polarized light through a [[circular polarizer]] which allows either only &lt;math&gt;|R\rangle&lt;/math&gt; polarized light, or only &lt;math&gt;|L\rangle&lt;/math&gt; polarized light, intensity would be reduced by half in both cases. This may make it ''seem'' like half of the photons are in state &lt;math&gt;|R\rangle&lt;/math&gt; and the other half in state &lt;math&gt;|L\rangle&lt;/math&gt;. But this is not correct: Both &lt;math&gt;|R\rangle&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;|L\rangle&lt;/math&gt; photons are partly absorbed by a vertical [[linear polarizer]], but the &lt;math&gt;(|R\rangle+|L\rangle)/\sqrt{2}&lt;/math&gt; light will pass through that polarizer with no absorption whatsoever.

However, [[unpolarized light]] (such as the light from an [[incandescent light bulb]]) is different from any state like &lt;math&gt;\alpha|R\rangle+\beta|L\rangle&lt;/math&gt; (linear, circular, or elliptical polarization). Unlike linearly or elliptically polarized light, it passes through a polarizer with 50% intensity loss whatever the orientation of the polarizer; and unlike circularly polarized light, it cannot be made linearly polarized with any [[wave plate]] because randomly oriented polarization will emerge from a wave plate with random orientation. Indeed, unpolarized light cannot be described as ''any'' state of the form &lt;math&gt;\alpha|R\rangle+\beta|L\rangle&lt;/math&gt; in a definite sense. However, unpolarized light ''can'' be described with ensemble averages, e.g. that each photon is either &lt;math&gt;| R \rangle &lt;/math&gt; with 50% probability or &lt;math&gt;| L \rangle &lt;/math&gt; with 50% probability. The same behavior would occur if each photon was either vertically polarized with 50% probability or horizontally polarized with 50% probability.

Therefore, unpolarized light cannot be described by any pure state, but can be described as a [[statistical ensemble]] of pure states in at least two ways (the ensemble of half left and half right circularly polarized, or the ensemble of half vertically and half horizontally linearly polarized). These two ensembles are completely indistinguishable experimentally, and therefore they are considered the same mixed state. One of the advantages of the density matrix is that there is just one density matrix for each mixed state, whereas there are many statistical ensembles of pure states for each mixed state. Nevertheless, the density matrix contains all the information necessary to calculate any measurable property of the mixed state.

Where do mixed states come from? To answer that, consider how to generate unpolarized light. One way is to use a system in [[thermal equilibrium]], a statistical mixture of enormous numbers of [[Microstate (statistical mechanics)|microstates]], each with a certain probability (the [[Boltzmann factor]]), switching rapidly from one to the next due to [[thermal fluctuations]]. Thermal randomness explains why an [[incandescent light bulb]], for example, emits unpolarized light. A second way to generate unpolarized light is to introduce uncertainty in the preparation of the system, for example, passing it through a [[birefringent crystal]] with a rough surface, so that slightly different parts of the beam acquire different polarizations. A third way to generate unpolarized light uses an [[EPR paradox|EPR]] setup: A radioactive decay can emit two photons traveling in opposite directions, in the quantum state &lt;math&gt;(|R,L\rangle+|L,R\rangle)/\sqrt{2}&lt;/math&gt;. The two photons ''together'' are in a pure state, but if you only look at one of the photons and ignore the other, the photon behaves just like unpolarized light.

More generally, mixed states commonly arise from a statistical mixture of the starting state (such as in thermal equilibrium), from uncertainty in the preparation procedure (such as slightly different paths that a photon can travel), or from looking at a subsystem entangled with something else.

== Definition ==
For a finite-dimensional function space, the most general density operator is of the form

:&lt;math&gt; \rho = \sum_j p_j |\psi_j \rangle \langle \psi_j| &lt;/math&gt;

where the coefficients ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; are non-negative and add up to one, and &lt;math&gt;\textstyle |\psi_j \rangle \langle \psi_j |&lt;/math&gt; is an [[outer product]] written in [[bra-ket notation]].  This represents a mixed state, with probability ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; that the system is in the pure state &lt;math&gt;\textstyle |\psi_j \rangle&lt;/math&gt;.

For the above example of unpolarized light, the density operator is

:&lt;math&gt;\rho ={\tfrac {1}{2}}|R\rangle \langle R|+{\tfrac {1}{2}}|L\rangle \langle L|.&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\textstyle |L \rangle&lt;/math&gt; is the left-circularly-polarized photon state and &lt;math&gt;\textstyle |R \rangle&lt;/math&gt; is the right-circularly-polarized photon state.

=== Different statistical ensembles with the same density matrix ===

An earlier section gave an example of two statistical ensembles of pure states that have the same density operator: unpolarized light can be described as both 50% right-circular-polarized and 50% left-circular-polarized, or 50% horizontally-polarized and 50% vertically-polarized. Such equivalent ensembles or mixtures cannot be distinguished by any measurement. This equivalence can be characterized precisely. Two ensembles ψ,  ψ' define the same density operator [[if and only if]] there is a [[Unitary operator]] U with

:&lt;math&gt; | \psi_i'\rangle \sqrt {p_i'} = \sum_{j} u_{ij} | \psi_j\rangle \sqrt {p_j}~.&lt;/math&gt;

This is simply a restatement of the following fact from linear algebra: for two square matrices {{mvar|M}} and {{mvar|N}}, ''M M''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; = ''N N''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; if and only if ''M'' = ''NU'' for some unitary {{mvar|U}}. (See [[square root of a matrix]] for more details.) Thus there is a unitary freedom in the ket mixture or ensemble that gives the same density operator.  However, if the kets making up the mixture are restricted to be a specific [[orthonormal]] basis, then the original probabilities ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; are uniquely recoverable from that basis, as the eigenvalues of the density matrix.

=== Mathematical properties and purity condition ===

In operator language, a density operator is a [[positive-definite matrix|positive semidefinite]], [[Hermitian matrix|Hermitian]] operator  of [[trace class operator|trace 1]] acting on the state space.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Hall |first = B.C. |title = Quantum Theory for Mathematicians |volume = 267 | page = 423 |publisher = Springer | year = 2013|doi=10.1007/978-1-4614-7116-5|isbn=978-1-4614-7115-8|series=Graduate Texts in Mathematics}}&lt;/ref&gt; A density operator describes a [[Purity (quantum mechanics)|pure]] state if it is a [[Rank (linear algebra)|rank]] one projection. Equivalently, a density operator ρ describes a [[Purity (quantum mechanics)|pure]] state if and only if
: &lt;math&gt; \rho = \rho^2&lt;/math&gt;,
i.e. the state is [[idempotent]]. This is true regardless of whether {{mvar|H}} is finite-dimensional or not.

Geometrically, when the state is not expressible as a [[convex combination]] of other states, it is a pure state.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Hall |first = B.C. |title = Quantum Theory for Mathematicians |volume = 267 | page = 439 |publisher = Springer | year = 2013|doi=10.1007/978-1-4614-7116-5|isbn=978-1-4614-7115-8|series=Graduate Texts in Mathematics}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The family of mixed states is a convex set and a state is pure if it is an [[extremal point]] of that set.

It follows from the [[compact operator on Hilbert space|spectral theorem for compact self-adjoint operators]] that every mixed state is a countable convex combination of pure states.  This representation is not unique. Furthermore, a theorem of [[Andrew Gleason]] states that certain functions defined on the family of projections and taking values in [0,1] (which can be regarded as quantum analogues of probability measures) are determined by unique mixed states. See [[Quantum logic#Statistical structure|quantum logic]] for more details.

== Measurement ==
Let ''A'' be an [[observable]] of the system, and suppose the ensemble is in a mixed state such that each of the pure states &lt;math&gt;\textstyle |\psi_j\rangle&lt;/math&gt; occurs with probability ''p&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;''. Then the corresponding density operator is:

:&lt;math&gt;\rho = \sum_j p_j |\psi_j \rangle \langle \psi_j| .&lt;/math&gt;

The [[Expectation value (quantum mechanics)|expectation value]] of the measurement can be calculated by extending from the case of pure states (see [[Measurement in quantum mechanics]]):

:&lt;math&gt; \langle A \rangle = \sum_j p_j \langle \psi_j|A|\psi_j \rangle = \sum_j p_j \operatorname{tr}\left(|\psi_j \rangle \langle \psi_j|A \right) = \sum_j  \operatorname{tr}\left(p_j |\psi_j \rangle \langle \psi_j|A\right)  =   \operatorname{tr}\left(\sum_j p_j |\psi_j \rangle \langle \psi_j|A\right) = \operatorname{tr}(\rho A),&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{tr}&lt;/math&gt; denotes [[trace (linear algebra)|trace]]. Thus, the familiar expression &lt;math&gt;\langle A\rangle=\langle\psi|A|\psi\rangle&lt;/math&gt; for pure states is replaced by
:&lt;math&gt; \langle A \rangle = \operatorname{tr}(\rho A)&lt;/math&gt;
for mixed states.

Moreover, if ''A'' has spectral resolution

:&lt;math&gt;A = \sum_i a_i |a_i \rangle \langle a_i| = \sum _i a_i P_i,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;P_i = |a_i \rangle \langle a_i|&lt;/math&gt;, the corresponding density operator after the measurement is given by:

:&lt;math&gt;\; \rho ' = \sum_i P_i \rho P_i.&lt;/math&gt;

Note that the above density operator describes the full ensemble after measurement. The sub-ensemble for which the measurement result was the particular value ''a&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' is described by the different density operator

:&lt;math&gt;\rho_i' = \frac{P_i \rho P_i}{\operatorname{tr}[\rho P_i]}.&lt;/math&gt;

This is true assuming that &lt;math&gt;\textstyle |a_i\rangle&lt;/math&gt; is the only eigenket (up to [[phase factor|phase]]) with [[eigenvalue]] ''a&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''; more generally, ''P&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' in this expression would be replaced by the [[projection operator]] into the [[eigenspace|eigen''space'']] corresponding to eigenvalue ''a&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''.

More generally, suppose &lt;math&gt;\Phi&lt;/math&gt; is a function that associates to each observable ''A''  a number &lt;math&gt;\Phi(A)&lt;/math&gt;, which we may think of as the "expectation value" of ''A''. If &lt;math&gt;\Phi&lt;/math&gt; satisfies some natural properties (such as giving positive values on positive operators), then there is a unique density matrix &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; such that
:&lt;math&gt;\Phi(A)=\operatorname{tr}(\rho A)&lt;/math&gt;
for all ''A''.&lt;ref&gt;See Theorem 19.9 in {{citation | last = Hall |first = B.C. |title = Quantum Theory for Mathematicians |volume = 267 | year = 2013|doi=10.1007/978-1-4614-7116-5|isbn=978-1-4614-7115-8|series=Graduate Texts in Mathematics|publisher=Springer}}&lt;/ref&gt; That is to say, any reasonable "family of expectation values" is representable by a density matrix. This observation suggests that density matrices are the most general notion of a quantum state.

== Entropy ==
The [[von Neumann entropy]] &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; of a mixture can be expressed in terms of the eigenvalues of &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; or in terms of the [[Trace (linear algebra)|trace]] and [[Matrix logarithm|logarithm]] of the density operator &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt;. Since &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; is a positive semi-definite operator, it has a [[spectral theorem|spectral decomposition]] such that &lt;math&gt;\rho = \textstyle\sum_i \lambda_i |\varphi_i\rangle \langle\varphi_i|&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;|\varphi_i\rangle&lt;/math&gt; are orthonormal vectors, &lt;math&gt;\lambda_i &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \sum \lambda_i = 1&lt;/math&gt;. Then the entropy of a quantum system with density matrix &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; is

:&lt;math&gt;S = -\sum_i \lambda_i \ln\lambda_i = -\operatorname{tr}(\rho \ln\rho).&lt;/math&gt;

This entropy can increase, but never decrease, with a projective measurement. However, generalised measurements can decrease entropy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1=Nielsen | first1=Michael | last2=Chuang | first2=Isaac | title=Quantum Computation and Quantum Information | publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] | isbn=978-0-521-63503-5 | year=2000}}.

"Monotone decrease of information for stochastic processes"  | pages=128–129}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The entropy of a pure state is zero, while that of a proper mixture is always greater than zero.  Therefore, a pure state may be converted into a mixture by a measurement, but a proper mixture can ''never'' be converted into a pure state.  Thus the act of measurement induces a fundamental [[irreversible process|irreversible]] change on the density matrix; this is analogous to the "collapse" of the state vector, or [[wavefunction collapse]]. Perhaps counterintuitively, the measurement actually ''decreases information'' by erasing quantum interference in the composite system, see [[quantum entanglement]], [[einselection]], and [[quantum decoherence]].

A subsystem of a larger system can be turned from a mixed to a pure state, but only by increasing the von Neumann entropy elsewhere in the system. This is analogous to how the entropy of an object can be lowered by putting it in a refrigerator: The air outside the refrigerator's heat exchanger warms up, gaining even more entropy than was lost by the object in the refrigerator. See [[second law of thermodynamics]]. See [[Entropy in thermodynamics and information theory]].

== Systems and subsystems==
Another motivation for considering density matrices comes from consideration of systems and their subsystems.
Suppose we have two quantum systems, described by Hilbert spaces &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{H}_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{H}_2&lt;/math&gt;. The composite system is then the [[tensor product]] &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{H}_1\otimes\mathcal{H}_2&lt;/math&gt; of the two Hilbert spaces. Suppose now that the composite system is in a pure state &lt;math&gt;\psi\in\mathcal{H}_1\otimes\mathcal{H}_2&lt;/math&gt;. If &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt; happens to have the special form &lt;math&gt;\psi=\psi_1\otimes\psi_2&lt;/math&gt;, then we may reasonably say that the state of the first subsystem is &lt;math&gt;\psi_1&lt;/math&gt;. In this case, we say that the two systems are not entangled. In general, however, &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt; will not decompose as a single tensor product of vectors in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{H}_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{H}_2&lt;/math&gt;. If &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt; cannot be decomposed as a single tensor product of states in the component systems, we say that the two systems are entangled. In that case, there is no reasonable way to associate a pure state &lt;math&gt;\psi_1\in\mathcal{H}_1&lt;/math&gt; to the state &lt;math&gt;\psi\in\mathcal{H}_1\otimes\mathcal{H}_2&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;See Sections 19.1 and 19.5 in {{citation | last = Hall |first = B.C. |title = Quantum Theory for Mathematicians |volume = 267 | year = 2013|doi=10.1007/978-1-4614-7116-5|isbn=978-1-4614-7115-8|series=Graduate Texts in Mathematics|publisher=Springer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If, for example, we have a wave function &lt;math&gt;\psi(x_1,x_2)&lt;/math&gt; describing the state of two particles, there is no natural way to construct a wave function (i.e., pure state) &lt;math&gt;\psi_1(x_1)&lt;/math&gt; that describes the states of the first particle—unless &lt;math&gt;\psi(x_1,x_2)&lt;/math&gt; happens to be a product of a function &lt;math&gt;\psi_1(x_1)&lt;/math&gt; and a function &lt;math&gt;\psi_2(x_2)&lt;/math&gt;.

The upshot of the preceding discussion is that even if the total system is in a pure state, the various subsystems that make it up will typically be in mixed states. Thus, the use of density matrices is unavoidable.

On the other hand, whether the composite system is in a pure state or a mixed state, we can perfectly well construct a density matrix that describes the state of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{H}_1&lt;/math&gt;. Denote the density matrix of the composite system of two systems by &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt;. Then the state of, say, &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{H}_1&lt;/math&gt;, is described by a [[Reduced density matrix#Reduced density matrices|reduced density operator]], given by taking the "partial trace" of &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; over &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{H}_2&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;See Theorem 19.13 in {{citation | last = Hall |first = B.C. |title = Quantum Theory for Mathematicians |volume = 267 | year = 2013|doi=10.1007/978-1-4614-7116-5|isbn=978-1-4614-7115-8|series=Graduate Texts in Mathematics|publisher=Springer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If the state of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{H}_1\otimes\mathcal{H}_2&lt;/math&gt; happens to be a density matrix of the special form &lt;math&gt;\rho=\rho_1\otimes\rho_2&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\rho_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\rho_2&lt;/math&gt; are density matrices on &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{H}_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{H}_2&lt;/math&gt;, then the partial trace of &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; with respect to &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{H}_2&lt;/math&gt; is just &lt;math&gt;\rho_1&lt;/math&gt;. A typical &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; will not be of this form, however.

{{See also|Liouville's theorem (Hamiltonian)#Quantum Liouville equation}}
Just as the [[Schrödinger equation]] describes how pure states evolve in time, the '''von Neumann equation''' (also known as the '''Liouville–von Neumann equation''') describes how a density operator evolves in time (in fact, the two equations are equivalent, in the sense that either can be derived from the other.) The von Neumann equation dictates that&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=The theory of open quantum systems|last1= Breuer |first1=Heinz|last2= Petruccione|first2=Francesco|page=110|isbn=978-0-19-852063-4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0Yx5VzaMYm8C&amp;pg=PA110 |year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=o-HyHvRZ4VcC&amp;pg=PA16 |title=Statistical mechanics|last=Schwabl|first=Franz|page=16|isbn=978-3-540-43163-3|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; i \hbar \frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t} = [H,\rho]~, &lt;/math&gt;

where the brackets denote a [[commutator]].

Note that this equation only holds when the density operator is taken to be in the [[Schrödinger picture]], even though this equation seems at first look to emulate the Heisenberg equation of motion in the [[Heisenberg picture]], with a crucial sign difference:

:&lt;math&gt; i \hbar \frac{dA^{(H)}}{dt}=-[H,A^{(H)}] ~,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;A^{(H)}(t)&lt;/math&gt; is some ''Heisenberg picture'' operator; but in this picture the density matrix is ''not time-dependent'', and the relative sign ensures that the time derivative of the expected value &lt;math&gt;\langle A \rangle&lt;/math&gt; comes out ''the same as in the Schrödinger picture''.&lt;ref&gt;See Axiom 8 and the discussion that follows in Section 19.4 of {{citation | last = Hall |first = B.C. |title = Quantum Theory for Mathematicians |volume = 267 | year = 2013|doi=10.1007/978-1-4614-7116-5|isbn=978-1-4614-7115-8|series=Graduate Texts in Mathematics|publisher=Springer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Taking the density operator to be in the Schrödinger picture makes sense, since it is composed of 'Schrödinger' kets and bras evolved in time, as per the Schrödinger picture.
If the Hamiltonian is time-independent, this differential equation can be easily solved to yield

:&lt;math&gt;\rho(t) = e^{-i H t/\hbar} \rho(0) e^{i H t/\hbar}.&lt;/math&gt;

For a more general Hamiltonian, if &lt;math&gt;G(t)&lt;/math&gt; is the wavefunction propagator over some interval, then the time evolution of the density matrix over that same interval is given by

:&lt;math&gt; \rho(t) = G(t) \rho(0) G(t)^\dagger.&lt;/math&gt;

However,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|arxiv=cond-mat/0303290|last1=Grandy|first1=W. T|title=Time Evolution in Macroscopic Systems.

== "Quantum Liouville", Moyal's equation ==
The density matrix operator may also be realized in [[phase space]]. Under the [[Wigner quasi-probability distribution#The Wigner–Weyl transformation|Wigner map]], the density matrix transforms into the equivalent [[Wigner quasi-probability distribution|Wigner function]],
:&lt;math&gt; W(x,p) \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=} \frac{1}{\pi\hbar} \int_{-\infty}^\infty \psi^*(x + y) \psi(x - y) e^{2ipy/\hbar} \,dy.&lt;/math&gt;
The equation for the time evolution of the Wigner function is then the Wigner-transform of the above von Neumann equation,
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial W(q, p, t)}{\partial t} = -\{\{W(q, p, t), H(q, p)\}\},&lt;/math&gt;
where ''H''(''q'', ''p'') is the Hamiltonian, and &lt;nowiki&gt;{{•, •}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; is the [[Moyal bracket]], the transform of the quantum [[commutator]].

The evolution equation for the Wigner function is then analogous to that of its classical limit, the [[Liouville's theorem (Hamiltonian)#Liouville equations|Liouville equation]] of [[classical physics]].  In the limit of vanishing Planck's constant ''ħ'', ''W''(''q'', ''p'', ''t'') reduces to the classical Liouville probability density function in [[phase space]].

The classical Liouville equation can be solved using the [[method of characteristics]] for partial differential equations, the characteristic equations being [[Hamilton's equations]]. The Moyal equation in quantum mechanics similarly admits formal solutions in terms of [[method of quantum characteristics|quantum characteristics]], predicated on the [[Moyal product|∗−product]] of phase space, although, in actual practice, solution-seeking follows different methods.

== Example applications ==
Density matrices are a basic tool of quantum mechanics, and appear at least occasionally in almost any type of quantum-mechanical calculation. Some specific examples where density matrices are especially helpful and common are as follows:
* [[Quantum decoherence]] theory typically involves non-isolated quantum systems developing entanglement with other systems, including measurement apparatuses. Density matrices make it much easier to describe the process and calculate its consequences.
* Similarly, in [[quantum computation]], [[quantum information theory]], and other fields where state preparation is noisy and decoherence can occur, density matrices are frequently used.
** [[Quantum tomography]] is the process of experimentally measuring the density matrix of a system.
* When analyzing a system with many electrons, such as an [[atom]] or [[molecule]], an imperfect but useful first approximation is to treat the electrons as [[electronic correlation|uncorrelated]] or each having an independent single-particle wavefunction. This is the usual starting point when building the [[Slater determinant]] in the [[Hartree–Fock]] method. If there are N electrons filling the N single-particle wavefunctions &lt;math&gt;|\psi_i\rangle&lt;/math&gt;, then the collection of N electrons together can be characterized by a density matrix &lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=1}^N |\psi_i\rangle \langle \psi_i|&lt;/math&gt;.

== C*-algebraic formulation of states ==
It is now generally accepted that the description of quantum mechanics in which all self-adjoint operators represent observables is untenable.&lt;ref&gt;See appendix,  {{Citation | last1=Mackey | first1=George Whitelaw | author1-link=George Mackey | title=Mathematical Foundations of Quantum Mechanics | publisher=[[Dover Publications]] | location=New York | series=Dover Books on Mathematics | isbn=978-0-486-43517-6 | year=1963}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1=Emch | first1=Gerard G. | title=Algebraic methods in statistical mechanics and quantum field theory | publisher=[[Wiley-Interscience]] | isbn=978-0-471-23900-0 | year=1972}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For this reason, observables are identified with elements of an abstract [[C*-algebra]] ''A'' (that is one without a distinguished representation as an algebra of operators) and [[state (functional analysis)|states]] are positive [[linear functional]]s on ''A''. However, by using the [[GNS construction]], we can recover Hilbert spaces which realize ''A'' as a subalgebra of operators.

Geometrically, a pure state on a C*-algebra ''A''  is a state which is an extreme point of the set of all states on ''A''.  By properties of the GNS construction these states correspond to [[irreducible representation]]s of ''A''.

The states of the C*-algebra of [[compact operator]]s ''K''(''H'') correspond exactly to the density operators, and therefore the pure states  of ''K''(''H'') are exactly the pure states in the sense of quantum mechanics.

The C*-algebraic formulation can be seen to include both classical and quantum systems. When the system is classical, the algebra of observables become an abelian C*-algebra.  In that case the states become probability measures, as noted in the introduction.

The '''Department of Zoology''' is the [[zoology]] department of the [[University of Oxford]], England, which is part of the university's [[Mathematical, Physical and Life Sciences Division, University of Oxford|Mathematical, Physical and Life Sciences Division]].

==Overview==
The department has several institutes and a Research Unit in and around the [[Radcliffe Observatory Quarter]], [[Science Area, Oxford|Science Area]] and [[Oxford]]:&lt;ref name="oxford15"&gt;{{cite book| title=Oxford University Pocket Diary | year=2014–15 | publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] | chapter=Zoology, Dept of | page=175 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Biodiversity Institute]]
* [[Edward Grey Institute of Field Ornithology]]
* [[Institute for Emerging Infections]]
* [[Wildlife Conservation Research Unit]] (WildCRU – in [[Tubney]], [[Oxfordshire]])

Research in the Department focuses on the themes of [[Animal behaviour|behaviour]], [[disease]], [[ecology]], and [[evolution]]. The Department is within the Mathematical, Physical and Life Sciences Division of Oxford University. The main building, the [[Tinbergen Building]] (named after [[Niko Tinbergen]]), is on the corner of [[South Parks Road]] and [[St Cross Road]], with [[Linacre College, Oxford|Linacre College]] and an entrance to the [[University Parks]] opposite.

In February 2017, officials announced that the Tinbergen Building would be closed for two years and all research and teaching activities of the Zoology Department would be moved elsewhere in the university due to the discovery of [[asbestos]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.oxfordmail.co.uk/news/15084594.Oxford_University_to_close_buildings_and_relocate_hundreds_of_staff_after_asbestos_discovery/ | title=Oxford University Zoology and experimental psychology buildings to close for two years due to asbestos | newspaper=[[Oxford Mail]] | accessdate=11 February 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-oxfordshire-38934959 | title=Asbestos find closes Oxford University building for two years | publisher=[[BBC]] | work=[[BBC News]] | date=10 February 2017 | accessdate=1 May 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Echinobase''' is a  web information system that catalogs diverse genomic and biological data for the echinoderm [[clade]].  The system provides a  gene search engine, genomics browser and other bioinformatics tools to explore genomic and transcriptomic data. The Echinobase information system  focuses on information from eight echinoderm research models: ''[[Strongylocentrotus purpuratus]]'', ''[[Red sea urchin|Strongylocentrotus fransciscanus]], [[Strongylocentrotus fragilis|Allocentrotus fragilis]]'', ''[[Lytechinus variegatus]]'', ''[[Bat star|Patiria miniata]]'', ''[[Parastichopus parvimensis]]'' and ''Ophiothrix spiculata'', ''[[Eucidaris tribuloides]]''. The goal of Echinobase is to support molecular biological science including developmental processes and gene regulatory networks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kudtarkar|first=Parul|last2=Cameron|first2=R.

'''Education 2030 Agenda''' refers to the global commitment of the [[Education For All|Education for All]] movement to ensure access to basic education for all.  It is an essential part of the [[Sustainable Development Goals|2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development]]. The roadmap to achieve the Agenda is the Education 2030 [[Incheon declaration|Incheon Declaration]] and Framework for Action, which outlines how countries, working with [[UNESCO]] and global partners, can translate commitments into action.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0024/002472/247234e.pdf|title=Education Transforms Lives|last=UNESCO|first=|publisher=Paris, UNESCO|year=2017|isbn=|location=|pages=6, 8–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Education 2030 Agenda stretches from early childhood learning to youth and adult education and training; Emphasizes the acquisition of skills for work; Underlines the importance of citizenship education; Focuses on inclusion, equity and gender equality; And aims to ensure quality learning outcomes for all, throughout their lives.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

While the main responsibility for implementing the agenda lies with governments, UNESCO and partners provide support through coordinated policy advice, technical assistance, capacity development and monitoring of progress at global, regional and national levels.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Ten targets to achieve the Education 2030 Agenda ==
The 10 targets of [[Sustainable Development Goals|Sustainable Development Goal]] 4 encompass many different aspects of education. Seven targets are of expected outcomes and three are means of achieving these targets.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[File:Blast Area Security.webm|thumb|A video on safety when using explosives in the workplace]]
'''Explosives safety''' originated as a formal program in the [[United States]] in the aftermath of [[World War I]] when several ammunition storage areas were destroyed in a series of mishaps. The most serious occurred at [[Picatinny Arsenal Ammunition Storage Depot]], New Jersey, in July, 1926 when an electrical storm led to fires that caused explosions and widespread destruction. The severe property damage and 19 fatalities led Congress to empower a board of Army and Naval officers to investigate the Picatinny Arsenal disaster and determine if similar conditions existed at other ammunition depots. The board reported in its findings that this mishap could recur, prompting [[United States Congress|Congress]] to establish a permanent board of colonels to develop explosives safety standards and ensure compliance beginning in 1928. This organization evolved into the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] Explosives Safety Board (DDESB) and is chartered in Title 10 of the US Code. Today, the DDESB authors DOD Manual 6055.9, Ammunition and Explosives Safety Standards. It also evaluates scientific data which may adjust those standards, reviews and approves all explosives site plans for new construction, and conducts worldwide visits to locations containing US title munitions.

==US Air Force==
The [[United States Air Force]] counterpart to the DDESB is the [[Air Force Safety Center]] (AFSEC/SEW). Similarly safety functions are found at major command headquarters, intermediate command headquarters and at unit level as the weapons safety office. Quantity-Distance (QD) has evolved into the foundation of DOD 6055.9-STD, Ammunition and Explosives Safety Standards.  The current Air Force regulation governing explosives safety is Air Force Manual (AFMAN) 91-201.  AFMAN 91-201 was written using DODI 6055.9 as a parent regulation, and in most cases will follow the limitations set forth in the DODI (excluding mission specific requirements).  The Air Force deviates from DODI 6055.9 using AFMAN 91-201 as their primary source document to allow for deviation from many of the requirements of the DODI as long as the risks of doing so are accepted at the appropriate level.

==US Army==
The [[United States Army]] counterpart to the DDESB is the U.S. Army Technical Center for Explosives Safety (USATCES). The USATCES is located with the [[Defense Ammunition Center (United States)|Defense Ammunition Center]] on [[McAlester Army Ammunition Plant]], near McAlester, Oklahoma . USATCES is responsible for providing ammunition and explosives (A&amp;E) safety worldwide by acting as the field office of the Department of Army Safety responsible for A&amp;E safety. The USATCES also acts as the Army agency having safety oversight of clean-up of [[Formerly Used Defense Sites|Former Used Defense Sites (FUDS)]]&lt;ref&gt;1 [http://www.azdeq.gov/environ/waste/sps/download/state/fuds.pdf azdeq.gov] retrieved 2011-11-23&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;2 [https://environment.usace.army.mil/what_we_do/fuds/ U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE).] retrieved 2011-11-23&lt;/ref&gt; and Former Toxic Chemical Agent Sites where munitions from all branches of service disposed of A&amp;E by burial or dumping up until the end of the [[Vietnam War]]. The USATCES acts as the Army’s safety watchdog for disposal of chemical ammunition at the Army’s Chemical Disposal Facilities. As part of Army's Ordinance Corps under TRADOC Specially trained Civilian Explosives Safety Personnel [Quality Assurance Specialist (Ammunition Surveillance) (QASAS)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.apd.army.mil/pdffiles/r702_12.pdf apd.army.mil] retrieved 2011-11-23&lt;/ref&gt;]  and Safety Specialist that have received specialized training in A&amp;E Safety) from the USATCES are deployed worldwide, wherever the U.S. Army has A&amp;E. Their mission is to provide A&amp;E safety to the soldier, the public, and the environment making sure the Army’s A&amp;E is not only stored safely but ready, reliable, and lethal when the U.S. military needs it.

==Net Explosives Weight (NEW)==
The net explosives weight (NEW) (or TNT Equivalence) is based on explosives compounds that are equal to one  expressed by the value of “K,” using the terminology K9, K11, K18, to mean K = 9, K = 11, and K = 18.

==Blast Wave Phenomena==
A Blast Wave Phenomenon is an incident involving the violent release of energy created by detonation of an explosive device. The sudden and intense pressure disturbance is termed the “blast wave.” The blast wave is characterized by an almost instantaneous rise from ambient pressure to a peak incident pressure (Pi). This pressure increase or “shock front,” travels radially outward from the detonation point, with a diminishing velocity that is always in excess of the speed of sound in that medium. Gas molecules making up the front move at lower velocities. This velocity, which is called the “particle velocity,” is associated with the “dynamic pressure,” or the pressure formed by the winds produced by the shock front. As the shock front expands into increasingly larger volumes of the medium, the incident pressure decreases and, generally, the duration of the pressure-pulse increase. If the shock wave strikes a rigid surface (e.g., a building) at an angle to the direction of the wave’s propagation, a reflected pressure is instantly developed on the surface and this pressure rises to a value that exceeds the incident pressure. This reflected pressure is a function of the incident wave’s pressure and the angle formed between the rigid surface and the plane of the shock front.

==Fragments==
An important consideration in the analysis of the hazards associated with an explosion is the effect of any fragments produced. Fragmentation most commonly occur in high explosives events, fragmentation may occur in any incident involving ammunition and explosives (A&amp;E). Depending on their origin, fragments are referred to as “primary” or “secondary” fragments.

Primary fragments result from the shattering of a container (e.g., shell casings, kettles, hoppers, and other containers used in the manufacture of explosives and rocket engine housings) in direct contact with the explosive. These fragments usually are small, initially travel at thousands of feet per second, and may be lethal at long distances from an explosion.

Secondary fragments are debris from structures and other items in close proximity to the explosion. These fragments, which are somewhat larger in size than primary fragments and initially travel at hundreds of feet per second, do not normally travel as far as primary fragments.

==Thermal Hazards==
Generally, thermal hazards from explosives events are of less concern than blast and fragment hazards. With the release of energy from an explosion is heat. The amount of heat varies with the energetic compound (explosive). All explosives compound molecules are potentially unstable held together with weak bonds in their outer shell. When this weak bond is broken heat and energy is violently released. It normally takes longer for the thermal blast to incur. Injury from thermal effects follows the blast and fragmentation effects which happen almost instantaneously.  This does not imply that there is a time lapse between blast and fragmentation effects of explosives; in fact it happens so fast that humans cannot notice the delay without specialized equipment.  The time available to react to a thermal event does increases survivability by rapid equipment designed to react in a fragment of a second. The primary effect of the thermal effect from an explosive detonation on structures, material, and ammunition and explosives (A&amp;E) is their partial or total destruction by fire. The primary concern for explosives safety with a fire involving A&amp;E is that it may transition to a more severe reaction, causing detonations of additional or more hazardous explosives devises and placing more people or property at a greater degree of risk of damage, destruction, injury, or death.

==Susan Test==
{{redirect|Susan Test|the ''Johnny Test'' character|List of Johnny Test characters#Susan and Mary Test}}
Following the [[1966 Palomares B-52 crash]] and the [[1968 Thule Air Base B-52 crash]], accident investigators concluded that the conventional explosives used at the time in nuclear weapons were not [[Chemical stability|stable]] enough to withstand the forces involved in an [[aircraft]] accident.  The finding triggered research by scientists in the United States into safer conventional explosives that could be used in nuclear weapons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=l77rP6LA8TEC|title=Explosive Effects and Applications|author=Jonas A. Zukas, William P. Walters|pages=305–307|isbn=0-387-95558-5|publisher=Springer|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]] developed the "Susan Test" — a standard test that uses a special projectile whose design simulates an aircraft accident by squeezing and nipping explosive material between metal surfaces.  The test projectile is fired under controlled conditions at a hard surface to measure the reactions and thresholds of different explosives to an impact.

==Explosives Safety Specialist==
This is a highly trained and skilled civilian professional usually a QASAS or a Safety Specialist that has been trained to evaluate risk and hazards involved with conventional, guided missiles and toxic chemical ammunition operations. Department of Defense Standards requires that only trained and certified personnel are permitted to participate in operations involving ammunition, explosives, and/or explosive components, guided missiles, and toxic chemicals. They are responsible for providing protection from the effects of ammunition and explosives by evaluation of a set of standards developed by the Department of Defense and reinforced by additional regulations by the branch of military service responsible for the explosives item. 
They develop safety programs to minimize losses due to injuries and property damage. They try to eliminate unsafe practices and conditions on sites where ammunition and explosives (A&amp;E) are used or stored. Military explosives safety specialist are deployed along with U.S. Military forces to maintain safe storage and use of A&amp;E.   They are responsible to recommend to military command ways to store A&amp;E that reduce the risk of injury or death to service men and women in case of an accidental detonation or if the A&amp;E supply is hit by enemy attack.  
 
Much of the work of military explosives safety specialist is identical to their civilian counterparts. They have offices where they analyze data and write reports to upper commands on the storage of A&amp;E.  Much of their time is spent reviewing or preparing explosives safety site plans. An explosives site plan (ESS) is the composite risk management (CRM) process associated with explosives/toxic chemical activities to ensure the minimum risk to personnel, equipment, and assets, while meeting mission requirements. The damage or injury potential of explosions is determined by the separation distance between potential explosion sites (PES) and exposed sites (ES); the ability of the PES to suppress blast overpressure, primary and secondary fragments; and the ability of the ES to resist explosion effects. Planning for the proper location and construction of A&amp;E facilities and surrounding facilities exposed to A&amp;E facilities is a key element of the explosives/toxic chemical site planning process. This management process also ensures that risks above those normally accepted for A&amp;E activities are identified and approved at the proper level of command.

Explosives Safety Specialist must often travel to different storage sites to verify that the military installation is meeting the service explosives safety regulations.

Explosives Safety Specialist often works with other safety professionals. They are required to know OSHA, EPA, NFPA and other consensus standards when looking at safety and if these regulations are stricter than their service regulation they must apply these standards and regulations. They must also know Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (ATF) regulations dealing with A&amp;E and apply those standards if it is required.  They must be able to convince people the need for following prescribes explosives safety standards/regulations. They must also work with ammunition cleanup sites insuring that safety laws and regulations as well as industry standards are followed. They should be good at solving problems.

The military is not the only industry to use explosives safety specialist but are by far the largest employer.  Mining and construction also use explosives safety specialist to evaluate hazard and risk from explosives and blasting operations. Ammunition and explosives manufactures also use these professionals. Outside the military explosives safety specialist must apply and be knowledgeable of ATF, OSHA, EPA, NFPA, as well as state and local regulations dealing with safety of A&amp;E.

[[Image:Wiki-facial.png|thumb|alt=artist's illustration of dark-haired woman with right hand holding man's penis, left hand rubbing semen from her eye|An illustration of a man ejaculating onto a woman's face]]
A '''facial''' is a [[Human sexual activity|sexual activity]] in which a man [[ejaculation|ejaculates]] [[semen]] onto the face of one or more [[sexual partner]]s.&lt;ref name="Sex for Dummies"/&gt; A facial is a form of [[non-penetrative sex]], though it is generally performed after some other means of [[sexual stimulation]], such as [[Sexual intercourse|vaginal sex]], [[anal sex]], [[oral sex]] or [[masturbation]]. Facials are currently regularly portrayed in [[pornographic]] films and videos, often as a way to close a scene.&lt;ref name="tinynibbles.com"&gt;[[Violet Blue (author)|Violet Blue]], (Sep 2001) [http://www.tinynibbles.com/firstpr0n A First Timer's Guide to Watching Porn], "Facial ejaculation (men ejaculating on women's faces) is pretty much a standard."&lt;/ref&gt;

The performance of a facial is typically preceded by activities that result in the [[sexual arousal]] and stimulation of the ejaculating participant. After the prerequisite level of sexual stimulation has been achieved, and ejaculation becomes imminent, the male will position his [[Human penis|penis]] so that the semen discharged will be deposited onto his partner's face.

The volume of semen that is ejaculated depends on several factors, including the male's health, age, degree of sexual excitement, and the time since his last ejaculation.&lt;ref name="focus"&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://www.focusonfertility.org/resource_swimming_conception.htm |title=Swimming Toward Conception: The Semen Analysis | publisher=Focus on Fertility, American Infertility Association and Organon Pharmaceuticals USA Inc|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080112144449/http://www.focusonfertility.org/resource_swimming_conception.htm |archivedate=12 January 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Normal quantities of ejaculate range from 1.5 to 5.0 milliliters (1 [[teaspoon]]). Seconds after being deposited onto the face, the semen thickens, before liquefying 15–30 minutes later.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Gallup | first1 = G. G. | last2 = Burch | first2 = R.

==Health risks==

===Transmission of disease===
Any sexual activity that involves contact with the [[bodily fluid]]s of another person contains the risk of transmission of [[Sexually transmitted disease|sexually transmitted infections]] (STIs/STDs).&lt;ref name="Em &amp; Lo's"&gt;{{cite book|title=Em &amp; Lo's Rec Sex: An A-Z Guide to Hooking Up|year=2006|publisher=Chronicle Books|isbn=978-0-8118-5212-8|last=Taylor|first1=Emma|last2=Sharkey|first2=Lorelei|page=60}}&lt;/ref&gt; Semen is in itself generally harmless on the skin or if swallowed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Mann | first = Thaddeus | title = Male Reproductive Function and Semen | publisher = Springer | isbn = 978-0-387-10383-9 | year = 1981 | origyear = 1981}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Scheit | first = Karl H. | title = Proteins of Seminal Plasma | publisher = John Wiley &amp; Sons | isbn = 978-0-471-84685-7 | year = 1990 | origyear = 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, semen can be the vehicle for many sexually transmitted infections, such as HIV and [[hepatitis]]. The [[California Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] categorizes semen as "other potentially infectious material" or OPIM.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://www.dir.ca.gov/DOSH/AdultFilmIndustry.html#hh |title = Cal/OSHA Health Hazards in the Adult Film Industry |accessdate=25 July 2008 |publisher=State of California}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The risks incurred by the giving and receiving partner during the facial sexual act are drastically different. For the ejaculating partner there is almost no risk of contracting an STI. For the receiving partner, the risk is higher.&lt;ref name = Moore/&gt; Since potentially infected semen could come into contact with broken skin or sensitive [[mucous membrane]]s (eyes, lips, mouth), there is a risk of contracting an infectious disease.

===Allergic reactions===
In rare cases, people have been known to experience [[allergic reaction]]s to seminal fluids, known as human seminal plasma [[hypersensitivity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Guillet G, Dagregorio G, Guillet M | title = [Vulvar contact dermatitis due to seminal allergy: 3 cases] | journal = Ann Dermatol Venereol | volume = 132 | issue = 2 | pages = 123–5 | year = 2005 | pmid = 15798560 | doi=10.1016/S0151-9638(05)79221-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Symptoms can be either localized or systemic, and may include itching, redness, swelling, or blisters within 30 minutes of contact. They may also include [[hives]] and even difficulty breathing.

Treatment options for semen allergy include avoiding exposure to seminal fluid by use of condoms and attempting [[desensitization (medicine)|desensitization]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Weidinger S, Ring J, Köhn F | title = IgE-mediated allergy against human seminal plasma | journal = Chem Immunol Allergy | volume = 88 | pages = 128–138 | year = 2005| pmid = 16129942 | doi = 10.1159/000087830| series = Chemical Immunology and Allergy, 2005| isbn = 3-8055-7951-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural depictions==
Predating the modern age of pornography, facials were described in literature. As an example, the French aristocrat [[Marquis de Sade]] wrote about performing facials in his work ''[[The 120 Days of Sodom]]'', written in 1785. One passage of the novel reads "… I show them my prick, then what do you suppose I do? I squirt the fuck in their face… That's my passion my child, I have no other… and you're about to behold it."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Seaver| first = Richard| title = The 120 Days of Sodom and Other Writings| publisher = Grove Press| page=268| isbn = 978-0-8021-3012-9| year = 1987| origyear = 1987}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

===In pornography===
In the 1970s, the [[hardcore pornography]] genre introduced the stereotypical [[cumshot]] (also known as the [[money shot]]) scene as a central element ([[leitmotif]]) of the hardcore film, in which the male actor ejaculates in a way ensuring maximum visibility of the act itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Williams | first = Linda | author-link = Linda Williams (film scholar) | contribution = Fetishism and hard core: Marx, Freud, and the "money shot" | editor-last = Williams | editor-first = Linda | editor-link = Linda Williams (film scholar) | title = Hard core: power, pleasure, and the "frenzy of the visible" | pages = 93–94 | publisher = University of California Press | location = Berkeley | year = 1989 | isbn = 9780520066526 | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=OMa96WrLnhQC&amp;pg=PA93 Preview.]&lt;/ref&gt; These scenes may involve the female actor "calling for" the shot to be directed at some specific part of her body.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Williams | first = Linda | author-link = Linda Williams (film scholar) | contribution = Fetishism and hard core: Marx, Freud, and the "money shot" | editor-last = Williams | editor-first = Linda | editor-link = Linda Williams (film scholar) | title = Hard core: power, pleasure, and the "frenzy of the visible" | page = 101 | publisher = University of California Press | location = Berkeley | year = 1989 | isbn = 9780520066526 | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=OMa96WrLnhQC&amp;pg=PA101 Preview.]&lt;/ref&gt; Now facial cumshots are regularly portrayed in pornographic films, videos, magazines and internet web sites.&lt;ref name="tinynibbles.com"/&gt; Hugo Ohira, director of marketing for Silvercash, [[Rhetorical question|rhetorically]] asks "Who doesn't like spewing their [[semen|load]] on a pretty young face?"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Silvercash releases new solo-girl, tranny and facial sites | url=http://business.avn.com/articles/Silvercash-Releases-New-Solo-Girl-Tranny-and-Facial-Sites-46492.html | website = business.avn.com | publisher = AVN Online |accessdate=10 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to mainstream pornography, the popularity of facials has led to creation of its own niche market,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=The final (niche) frontier | url=http://business.avn.com/articles/The-Final-Niche-Frontier-26019.html | website = business.avn.com |publisher=AVN Online |accessdate=26 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; like video series that specialize in showing the act. Psychologist [[Ana J. Bridges|Ana Bridges]] and colleagues conducted a [[content analysis]] of best-selling heterosexual pornographic videos showing that over 96% of all scenes concluded with a male performer ejaculating onto the body of his female partner.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Bridges | first = Ana J. | author-link = Ana J.

==Criticisms and responses==

===Criticisms===
There are a variety of views ranging from facials being an act of degradation and elicit humiliation to being grounded in mutual respect and elicit pleasure.&lt;ref name="Hess 2009-08-24"&gt;{{cite web|last=Hess |first=Amanda|title=Semen Facials Are Like Weddings|url=http://www.washingtoncitypaper.com/blogs/sexist/2009/08/24/semen-facials-are-like-weddings/|work=[[Washington City Paper]]|date=24 August 2009|accessdate=8 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sex therapist]] [[Ruth Westheimer]] believes facials are humiliating and not sexy. She advises the average person contemplating oral sex to not think that a facial is a necessary

In one of her weekly articles she wrote "But let's give credit where credit is due: The money shot, by itself, is great for a number of reasons. Blowing it on someone's face is like a change-up pitch – if you've been throwing the heat for a while, maybe you should consider hooking the curve ball." She continues with "Also, being on the receiving end of the shot can satisfy the secret porn star in everyone and it's minor kink for beginners".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://www.dailynexus.com/2005-11-09/ejaculate-maturely/|title=Ejaculate Maturely: A Little Man Cream Never Went This Far|publisher=Daily Nexus |accessdate=2 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Semfac01.png|thumb|left|A woman receiving a facial]]
[[Feminist]] views of the depiction of male-on-female facials are primarily critical. Sociologists [[Gail Dines]], [[Robert W. Jensen|Robert Jensen]] and Russo echo these sentiments in the book ''Pornography: The Production and Consumption of Inequality''. It asserts "In pornography, ejaculating onto a woman is a primary method by which she is turned into a slut, something (not really someone) whose primary, if not only, purpose is to be sexual with men."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Dines | first = G |author2=Jensen R |author3=Russo A | title = Pornography: The Production and Consumption of Inequality | publisher = Routledge | pages= [https://books.google.com/books?id=0i7dw9CwUe4C&amp;pg=PA78 78] | isbn = 978-0-415-91812-1 | year = 1998 | origyear = 1997 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Radical feminist and noted critic of pornography [[Andrea Dworkin]] said "it is a convention of pornography that the sperm is on her not in her. It marks the spot, what he owns and how he owns it. The ejaculation on her is a way of saying (through showing) that she is contaminated with his dirt; that she is dirty."&lt;ref name="Moore"/&gt;

In Padraig McGrath's review of Laurence O'Toole's book ''Pornocopia – Porn, Sex, Technology and Desire'', he rhetorically asks whether "…women enjoy having men ejaculate on their faces?" He suggests that the role of such a scene is to illustrate that "…it doesn’t matter what the woman likes – she’ll like whatever the man wants her to like because she has no inner life of her own, in turn because she’s not a real person". McGrath argues that there is a "power-aspect" to depictions such as cum shots. He suggests that the "…central theme [of pornography] is power…[,] implicitly violent… eroticized hatred."&lt;ref name="Review"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.threemonkeysonline.com/review_pornocopia_laurence_otoole_review.htm |title=Pornocopia – Porn, Sex, Technology and Desire – by Laurence O'Toole|author=Padraig McGrath |publisher=Three Monkeys Online|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080611070220/http://www.threemonkeysonline.com/review_pornocopia_laurence_otoole_review.htm|archivedate=11 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gail Dines]], writing in ''Pornland: How Porn Has Hijacked Our Sexuality'', describes the money shot of a man ejaculating on the face or body of a woman as "one of the most degrading acts in porn".&lt;ref name="Dines2010xxiv"&gt;{{cite book|author=Gail Dines|title=Pornland: How Porn Has Hijacked Our Sexuality|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2ZOjb8Sk1bUC&amp;pg=PR26|accessdate=18 February 2011|date=1 July 2010|publisher=Beacon Press|isbn=978-0-8070-4452-0|page=xxiv}}&lt;/ref&gt; To Dines, the ejaculate on the female performer's body "marks the woman as used goods", conveying a sense of ownership, and she quotes veteran porn actor and producer [[Bill Margold]] as saying, "I'd like to really show what I believe the men want to see: violence against women. I firmly believe that we serve a purpose by showing that. The most violent we can get is the cum shot in the face. Men get off behind that because they get even with the women they can't have."&lt;ref name="Dines2010xxiv" /&gt; She adds that at least for some posters on adult forums discussing such scenes, the pleasure is derived from watching a woman suffer.&lt;ref name="Dines2010xxiv" /&gt;

Another critic of "cum shot" scenes in heterosexual pornography is the US pornography actress-turned writer, director and producer [[Candida Royalle]]. She produced pornography films aimed at women and their partners that avoid the "misogynous predictability" and depiction of sex in "…as grotesque and graphic [a way] as possible." Royalle also criticizes the male-centredness of the typical pornography film, in which scenes end when the male actor ejaculates.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2004/06/15/1087244912619.html Girls on top]" by Lilly Bragge, ''[[The Age]]'', 16 June 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Responses===
Author [[Lisa Moore (writer)|Lisa Moore]] suggests that Dworkin's explanation does not take into account that it is the pleasure the actresses exhibit that the male partners enjoy, and that it is more accurate to think men want their semen to be wanted.&lt;ref name="Moore"&gt;{{Cite book| last = Moore | first = LJ | title = Sperm Counts: Overcome by Man's Most Precious Fluid | publisher = [[New York University Press]] | pages= [https://books.google.com/books?id=tpiyGxq92RwC&amp;pg=PA84 84] | isbn = 978-0-8147-5718-5 | year = 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Women's activist [[Beatrice Faust]] argued, "since ejaculating into blank space is not much fun, ejaculating over a person who responds with enjoyment sustains a lighthearted mood as well as a degree of realism."

[[Sexology|Sexologist]] Peter Sándor Gardos argues that his research suggests that "… the men who get most turned on by watching cum shots are the ones who have positive attitudes toward women" (on the annual meeting of the Society for the Scientific Study of Sex in 1992).&lt;ref name="nearbycafe.com"&gt;[http://www.nearbycafe.com/loveandlust/steinberg/erotic/cn/cn2.html Bruce Herschensohn; Bill Clinton; Sexologists in San Diego; Future Sex 2] by Bruce Herschensohn.&lt;/ref&gt; Later, on The World Pornography Conference in 1998, he reported a similar conclusion, namely that "no pornographic image is interpretable outside of its historical and social context. Harm or degradation does not reside in the image itself".&lt;ref name=Labash&gt;[http://www.nerve.com/Dispatches/voicebox/MenOnPorn/Labash_excerpt.asp Excerpt] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090808193947/http://www.nerve.com/Dispatches/voicebox/MenOnPorn/Labash_excerpt.asp |date=8 August 2009 }} from "Among the Pornographers", Matt Labash's coverage of the 1998 World Pornography Conference for ''The Weekly Standard''.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cindy Patton]], activist and scholar on human sexuality, claims that in western culture male sexual fulfillment is synonymous with orgasm and that the male orgasm is an essential punctuation of the sexual narrative. No orgasm, no sexual pleasure. No cum shot, no narrative closure. In other words, the cum shot is the period at the end of the sentence.&lt;ref name="Moore"/&gt; In her essay "Speaking Out: Teaching In", Patton reached the conclusion that critics have devoted too little space to discovering the meaning that viewers attach to specific acts such as cum shots.&lt;ref name=slade/&gt;&lt;ref name=Patton&gt;{{Cite book| last = Fuss | first = Diana | title = Inside/Out: Lesbian Theories, Gay Theories | publisher = Routledge | pages= 373–386 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0cbuW1iQVIwC&amp;pg=PA373 | isbn = 978-0-415-90237-3 | year = 1991 | origyear = 1 September 1991 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gonocyte''' is a term created in 1957 by scientists Yves Clermont and Bernard Perey. Gonocytes relate to both fetal and neonatal germ cells from the point at which they enter the testis primordia until they reach the base membrane at the seminiferous cords and differentiate. It is responsible for [[gametogenesis]], which is [[spermatogenesis]] in males and [[oogenesis]] in females. Gonocytes include gametogonia (spermatogonia and oogonia), oocytes, ootids, and ova. The overall structures of fetal and postnatal gonocytes are described as large and spherical, with a prominent nucleus and two nucleoli.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8479">'''Green tree reservoirs''' ('''GTR'''s) consist of [[bottomland hardwood forest]] land which is shallowly flooded in the fall and winter.

Prior to modern industrialization and commercial farming, the Southeastern United States was home to more than 10 million hectares of bottomland hardwood forest. Today, there is only about 2.8 million hectares remaining (King et al. 2008).&lt;ref&gt;King, S. L., D. J. Twedt, and R. R. Wilson. 2006. The role of the wetland reserve program in conservation efforts in the Mississippi river alluvial valley. Wildlife Society Bulletin. 34: 914-920.&lt;/ref&gt; Not only are southeastern hardwood forests disappearing, but there has been a huge effort to control water flow so that natural forest flooding is less frequent. 
Bottomland hardwood forest is an important wetland habitat for many species of waterfowl, as well as other animals. In order to support migrating waterfowl, both private land managers and public agencies implement green tree reservoirs. In a GTR, a forest stand is flooded to create a seasonal wetland.  These seasonal wetlands provide habitat and food for [[waterfowl]], [[amphibians]], and many other species.

== Management ==
The water level on green tree reservoirs are manipulated by flooding and “draw down,” a process in which water is drained off of the reservoir. There are many methods for flooding a forest stand (Fredrickson and Batema 1992),&lt;ref&gt;Fredrickson. L. H. and D. L. Batema. 1992. Greentree reservoir management handbook. Gaylord Memorial Laboratory, University of Missouri.&lt;/ref&gt; many of which use levees or dykes. Water is either diverted from a natural source or pumped onto the landscape. This usually occurs in early winter, when trees are dormant and less likely to be damaged by standing water. The water should be drawn down before the tree dormancy stage has ended. This dormant season coincides with waterfowl migration, providing habitat for migrating birds.

In most cases, GTRs are flooded to a depth of 2-10 inches. Waterfowl in the order [[Anatinae]] are dabbling ducks that require only a shallow water depth. Diving ducks are less common on the [[Mississippi Flyway]], but they also can utilize a water depth of only 10 inches.
The water depth in a GTR will likely not be uniform. Various water depths allow for different types of food to be available at one time (Fredrickson and Reid 1988).&lt;ref&gt;Fredrickson, L. H. and F. A. Reid. 1988. Waterfowl management handbook. USFWS Fish and Wildlife Leaflet 13.2.1. Washington D. C.&lt;/ref&gt; Every species of animal that uses a GTR has slightly different food and habitat needs. Knowing the life history of the target species is critical to proper manipulation of a GTR.

There are plant and tree species specifically beneficial to waterfowl (discussed below), and the abundance of these species and forest composition can be managed by adjusting flood and draw down on the reservoir (Young et al. 1995).&lt;ref&gt;Young, G. L., B. L. Karr, B. D. Leopold, J. D. Hodges. Effects of greentree reservoir management on Mississippi bottomland hardwoods. Wildlife Society Bulletin. 23: 525-531.&lt;/ref&gt; Bottomland hardwood forests can also be effectively manipulated by removing timber; in some cases it is required to maintain viable forest stands (Kellison and Young 1997).&lt;ref&gt;Kellison, R. C. and M. J. Young. 1997. The bottomland hardwood forest of the southern United States. Forest Ecology and Management. 90: 101-115.&lt;/ref&gt;

Older research reflects the view that standing water in GTRs permanently damages trees and acorn production. (Young et al. 1995, Wigley and Filer 1989). However, more current research (King et al. 2006)&lt;ref&gt;King, S. L., D. J. Twedt, and R. R. Wilson. 2006. The role of the wetland reserve program in conservation efforts in the Mississippi river alluvial valley. Wildlife Society Bulletin. 34: 914-920.&lt;/ref&gt; shows that when managed properly, green tree reservoirs can be very productive. Many researchers have found that production in GTRs is highest when managers try to emulate natural hardwood wetlands (Fredrickson and Reid 1988,&lt;ref&gt;Fredrickson, L. H. and F. A. Reid. 1988. Waterfowl management handbook. USFWS Fish and Wildlife Leaflet 13.2.1. Washington D. C.&lt;/ref&gt; King and Allen 1996).&lt;ref&gt;King, S. L. and J. A. Allen. 1996. Plant succession and greentree reservoir management and restoration of bottomland hardwood wetlands. Wetlands. 16:503-511.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1985, 95% of GTRs were flooded annually and for longer than the dormancy season of the forest (Wigley and Filer 1989).&lt;ref&gt;Wigley, T. B. and T. H. Filer. 1989. Characteristics of greentree reservoirs: a survey of managers. Wildlife Society Bulletin. 17:136-142.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many plant species are adapted to a higher water tolerance; working with those plants rather than trying to force a dry-adapted plant to function in a wetland has increased GTR success. For example, [[pin oak]]s are a wetland oak and have small acorns suitable for waterfowl. In one study, researchers found that pin oak acorns even suffered less insect infestation (and therefore produced more usable food items for waterfowl) in flooded areas than in non-flooded forests (McQuilkin and Musbach 1977).&lt;ref&gt;McQuilkin, R. A. and R. A. Musbach. 1977. [[Pin oak]] acorn production on green tree reservoirs in southeastern Missouri. 41: 218-225.&lt;/ref&gt; Encouraging wetland plants suited for seasonally flooded areas supports the natural wetland model and results in better food sources.
In another example, it was found that fall flooding decreases grain availability for spring-migrating waterfowl (Greer et al. 2007).
Now that more research has emerged detailing the natural life history of wetland plants and trees, GTR managers are better prepared to manipulate the resource.

== Waterfowl production ==
The main use of GTRs is to increase production of waterfowl. This is especially true in the southeastern United States, where the Mississippi Flyway encourages duck hunting. Waterfowl that use the [[Mississippi Flyway]] include [[American black duck]] (''Anas rupribes''), [[blue-winged teal]] (''Anas discors''), [[green-winged teal]] (''Anas crecca''), [[gadwall]] (''Anas strepera''), [[northern shoveler]] (''Anas clypeata''), [[northern pintail]] (''Anas acuta''), [[mallard]] (''Anas platyrhynchos''), [[wood duck]] (''Aix sponsa''), and many others.  Migrating waterfowl have high energy needs and require stopover points on their migration route (Martin and Finch 1995).&lt;ref&gt;Martin, T. E. and D. M. Finch. 1995. Ecology and Management of Neotropical Migratory Birds. Oxford University Press, Oxford, United Kingdom.&lt;/ref&gt; With much of the bottomland hardwood forest in the southeast US destroyed, GTRs provide food and habitat for waterfowl during migration.

During a migration stopover, studies have shown that a duck’s diet may consist of 60% acorns or mast (Allen 1980).&lt;ref&gt;Allen, C. E. 1980. Feeding habits of ducks in a green-tree reservoir in eastern Texas. Journal of Wildlife Management. 44:232-236.&lt;/ref&gt; Migrating waterfowl require good sources of carbohydrates and protein.

Acorns are an important food source for waterfowl, but not every acorn is an acceptable food. Acorns must be small enough for a duck to swallow comfortably. Oak species that produce small acorns includes willow oak(''[[Quercus phellos]]''), water oak (''[[Quercus nigra]]''), pin oak (''[[Quercus palustris]]''), Nutall’s oak (''[[Quercus texana]]''), among several others. When a GTR is flooded, these acorns float to the surface; herbaceous vegetation is also available. Invertebrates common in the leaf litter “bloom” and provide protein for breeding waterfowl.

According to the Waterfowl Management Handbook (Fredrickson and Reid 1988), there are three criteria for foods to be available to waterfowl. 
:
:	“Foods are accessible if: 
:1.	Appropriate water depths are maintained during critical time periods.
:2.	Habitats are protected from disturbance
:3.	Habitats that provide protein and energy are close to one another”&lt;ref&gt;Fredrickson, L. H. and F. A. Reid. 1988. Waterfowl management handbook. USFWS Fish and Wildlife Leaflet 13.2.1. Washington D. C.&lt;/ref&gt;
:
According to Fredrickson and Reid (1988), disturbance from any source is detrimental to waterfowl during their stopover. Proper water depths and the juxtaposition of protein and energy contribute to waterfowl success.

'''Healthism''', sometimes called '''public-healthism''', is a [[neologism]] to describe a variety of [[ideology|ideological]] constructs concerning health and medicine. The term "healthism" was most likely first used by the political economist [[Robert Crawford (political economist)|Robert Crawford]], whose article "Healthism and the medicalization of everyday life"&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Robert Crawford, ''Healthism and the medicalization of everyday life''. (Health:, Vol. 10, No. 4, 401-420 (2006))&lt;/ref&gt; was published in 1980. In this article Crawford describes how the new political ideology, which emerged in the US during the 1970s, "[situated] the problem of health and disease at the level of the individual." The term is also known for its use in the 1994 book ''The Death of Humane Medicine and the Rise of Coercive Healthism'' by [[Petr Skrabanek]]. Skrabanek's use of "healthism", and most subsequent uses, are [[pejorative]] in intent. However, there is also a growing movement in the 21st century which see healthism as a positive empowering phenomenon which is not inherently coercive. This is exemplified through its popular uptake in the form of preventive medicine, yoga, meditation, fitness regimes, diets and the emphasis on lifestyle changes in Western society.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10152">In [[evolutionary developmental biology]], '''homeosis''' is the transformation of one [[organ (anatomy)|organ]] into another, arising from [[mutation]] in or misexpression of certain developmentally critical [[gene]]s, specifically homeotic genes. In animals, these developmental genes specifically control the development of organs on their anteroposterior axis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Beyond homeosis—HOX function in morphogenesis and organogenesis|url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1046/j.1432-0436.2003.7108004.x/abstract|journal = Differentiation|date = 2003-10-01|issn = 1432-0436|pages = 461–476|volume = 71|issue = 8|doi = 10.1046/j.1432-0436.2003.7108004.x|first = James Castelli-Gair|last = Hombría|first2 = Bridget|last2 = Lovegrove}}&lt;/ref&gt; In plants, however, the developmental genes affected by homeosis may control anything from the development of a [[stamen]] or petals to the development of chlorophyll.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sattler|first=Rolf|date=October 1998|title=Homeosis in Plants|jstor=2444710|journal=American Journal of Botany|volume=75|pages=1606–1617|doi=10.2307/2444710|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Homeosis may be caused by mutations in [[Hox genes]], found in animals, or others such as the [[MADS-box]] family in plants. Homeosis is a characteristic that has helped [[insect]]s become as successful and diverse as they are.&lt;ref&gt;Lodish et al., 2003. ''Molecular Cell Biology, 5th Edition''. W.H. Freeman and Company, New York.{{Page needed|date=June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Homeotic mutations work by changing segment identity during development. For example, the ''[[Ultrabithorax]]'' [[genotype]] gives a [[phenotype]] wherein metathoracic and first [[abdominal]] segments become mesothoracic segments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/287795a0 |title=Mutations affecting segment number and polarity in [[Drosophila]] |year=1980 |last1=Nüsslein-Volhard |first1=Christiane |last2=Wieschaus |first2=Eric |journal=Nature |volume=287 |issue=5785 |pages=795–801 |pmid=6776413|bibcode=1980Natur.287..795N }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another well-known example is ''[[Antennapedia]]'': a [[gain-of-function]] [[allele]] causes legs to develop in the place of [[Antenna (biology)|antennae]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/325816a0 |title=Redesigning the body plan of [[Drosophila]] by ectopic expression of the homoeotic gene Antennapedia |year=1987 |last1=Schneuwly |first1=Stephan |last2=Klemenz |first2=Roman |last3=Gehring |first3=Walter J. |journal=Nature |volume=325 |issue=6107 |pages=816–818 |pmid=3821869|bibcode=1987Natur.325..816S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Plant morphology|botany]], [[Rolf Sattler]] has revised the concept of homeosis (replacement) by his emphasis on partial homeosis in addition to complete homeosis; this revision is now widely accepted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |jstor=2444710 |pages=1606–1617 |last1=Sattler |first1=R. |title=Homeosis in Plants |volume=75 |issue=10 |journal=American Journal of Botany |year=1988 |doi=10.2307/2444710}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Homeotic mutants in [[angiosperms]] are thought to be rare in the wild: in the annual plant ''[[Clarkia]]'' ([[Onagraceae]]), homeotic mutants are known where the petals are replaced by a second whorl of sepal-like organs, originating via a mutation governed by a single recessive gene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/358671a0 |title=Bicalyx is a natural homeotic floral variant |year=1992 |last1=Ford |first1=V. S. |last2=Gottlieb |first2=L. D. |journal=Nature |volume=358 |issue=6388 |pages=671–673|bibcode=1992Natur.358..671F }}&lt;/ref&gt; The absence of lethal or deleterious consequences in floral mutants resulting in distinct morphological expressions has been a factor in the evolution of Clarkia, and perhaps also in many other plant groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |jstor=2461245 |pages=681–709 |last1=Gottlieb |first1=L. D. |title=Genetics and Morphological Evolution in Plants |volume=123 |issue=5 |journal=The American Naturalist |year=1984 |doi=10.1086/284231}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Homeotic mechanisms in animals==
Following the work on homeotic mutants by [[Edward B. Lewis|Ed Lewis]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=A gene complex controlling segmentation in [[Drosophila]] |year=1978 |last1=Lewis |first1=EB |journal=Nature |volume=276 |issue=5688 |pages=565–570 |pmid=103000 |doi=10.1038/276565a0|bibcode=1978Natur.276..565L }}&lt;/ref&gt; the phenomenology of homeosis in [[Metazoa|animals]] was further elaborated by discovery of a conserved DNA binding sequence present in many  homeotic proteins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=A conserved DNA sequence in homoeotic genes of the [[Drosophila]] Antennapedia and bithorax complexes |year=1984 |last1=McGinnis |first1=W |last2=Levine |first2=MS |last3=Hafen |first3=E |last4=Kuroiwa |first4=A |last5=Gehring |first5=WJ  |journal=Nature |volume=308 |issue=5958 |pages=428–433 |pmid=6323992 |doi=10.1038/308428a0|bibcode=1984Natur.308..428M }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Thus, the 60 amino acid DNA binding protein domain was named the [[homeodomain]], while the 180 bp nucleotide sequence encoding it was named the [[homeobox]]. The homeobox gene clusters studied by Ed Lewis were named the [[Hox genes]], although it should be noted that many more homeobox genes are encoded by animal [[genome]]s than those in the Hox gene clusters.

The homeotic-function of certain proteins was first postulated to be that of a "selector" as proposed by [[Antonio Garcia-Bellido]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Genetic control of wing disc development in [[Drosophila]]. |year=1975 |last1=Garcia-Bellido |first1=A |journal=Ciba Found. Symp |volume=0 |pages=161–-182 |pmid=1039909}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
By definition selectors were imagined to be ([[transcription factor]]) proteins that stably determined one of two possible cell fates for a cell and its cellular descendants in a [[Tissue (biology)|tissue]].   
While most animal homeotic functions are associated with homeobox-containing factors, not all homeotic proteins in animals are encoded by homeobox genes, and further not all homeobox genes are necessarily associated with homeotic functions or ([[mutant]]) phenotypes.
The concept of homeotic selectors was further elaborated or at least qualified by [[Michael Akam]] in a so-called "post-selector gene" model that incorporated additional findings and "walked back" the "orthodoxy" of selector-dependent stable binary switches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Hox genes, homeosis and the evolution of segment identity: no need for hopeless monsters.|year=1998 |last1=Akam |first1=M |journal=International Journal of Developmental Biology |volume=42 | pages=445–451 |pmid=9654030}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of [[Compartment (development)|tissue compartments]] is deeply intertwined with the selector model of homeosis because the selector-mediated maintenance of cell fate can be restricted into different organizational units of an animal's [[body plan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Signals and mechanics shaping compartment boundaries in [[Drosophila]] |year=2015 |last1=Umetsu |first1=D |last2=Dahmann |first2=C |journal=Wiley Interdiscip Rev Dev Biol |volume=4 |pages=407–417 |pmid=25755098 |doi=10.1002/wdev.178}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In this context, newer insights into homeotic mechanisms were found by [[Albert Erives]] and colleagues by focusing on [[Enhancer (genetics)|enhancer DNAs]] that are co-targeted by homeotic selectors and different combinations of developmental signals.&lt;ref name=Stroebele/&gt;
This work identifies a protein biochemical difference between the [[transcription factor]]s that function as homeotic selectors versus the [[transcription factor]]s that function as effectors of developmental signaling pathways, such as the [[Notch signaling pathway]] and the [[Transforming growth factor beta superfamily|BMP signaling pathway]].&lt;ref name="Stroebele"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Integration of Orthogonal Signaling by the Notch and Dpp Pathways in Drosophila |year=2016 |last1=Stroebele |first1=E |last2=Erives |first2=A |journal=Genetics |volume=203 |pages=219–240 |pmid=26975664 |doi=10.1534/genetics.116.186791 |pmc=4858776}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This work proposes that homeotic selectors function to "license" [[Enhancer (genetics)|enhancer DNAs]] in a restricted [[Compartment (development)|tissue compartment]] so that the enhancers are enabled to read-out developmental signals, which are then integrated via [[Polyglutamine tract|polyglutamine]]-mediated aggregation.&lt;ref name=Stroebele/&gt;

==Homeotic mechanisms in plants==
Like the complex [[Multicellular organism|multicellularity]] seen in [[animals]], the multicellularity of [[land plants]] is developmentally organized into [[Tissue (biology)|tissue]] and [[Organ (anatomy)|organ]] units via [[transcription factor]] genes with homeotic effects.&lt;ref name="Sablowski"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Control of patterning, growth, and differentiation by floral organ identity genes. |year=2015 |last1=Sablowski |first1=R |journal=Journal of Experimental Botany |volume=66 |issue=4 |pages=1065–1073 |pmid=25609826 |doi=10.1093/jxb/eru514}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Although plants have homeobox-containing genes, plant homeotic factors tend to possess [[MADS-box]] DNA binding domains.
Animal genomes also possess a small number [[MADS-box]] factors.
Thus, in the independent evolution of [[Multicellular organism|multicellularity]] in plants and animals, different [[Eukaryote|eukaryotic]] transcription factor families were [[Exaptation|co-opted]] to serve homeotic functions. 
MADS-domain factors have been proposed to function as co-factors to more specialized factors and thereby help to determine organ identity.&lt;ref name=Sablowski/&gt;
This has been proposed to correspond more closely to the interpretation of animal homeotics outlined by [[Michael Akam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Hox genes: From master genes to micromanagers |year=1998 |last1=Akam |first1=M |journal=Current Biology |volume=8 |pages=R676 |pmid=9768351 |doi=10.1016/s0960-9822(98)70433-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Institute for a Broadband-Enabled Society''' (IBES) is an [[Australia]]n research institute focusing on the development of [[broadband]]-enabled applications and technologies. The Institute is based in the Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering at [[The University of Melbourne]] in [[Victoria (Australia)]]. Research in the centre is clustered around five research themes:
* Education and Learning
* Health and Wellbeing
* Network Deployment and Economics
* Service and Business Transformation
* Social Infrastructure and Communities

== History ==
The Institute was established in 2009 with funding from the University of Melbourne and the State Government of Victoria. The Institutes aim is to develop research that will be able to exploit the [[Government of Australia|Australian Government']]s [[National Broadband Network]]. IBES is one of a number of research institutes developed by the University of Melbourne to increase interdisciplinary research activity. 
The Institute's Director is Laureate Professor Rod Tucker.

== Organisation ==
The Institute was established in 2009. IBES is jointly funded by the University of Melbourne and the [[Government of Victoria|Victorian State Government]], through the Department of Business and Innovation.

=== Advisory Board ===

The Advisory Board provides advice on matters relating to research directions, business strategies, and industry linkages. The members of the Advisory Board include:
* Steve Wood, CEO [[Tennis Australia]]
* [[Genevieve Bell]], Intel Fellow
* Chris Hancock, CEO [[AARNet]]

== Centres ==
Two centres are associated with the Institute for a Broadband-Enabled Society these are:

== Research ==
There are currently 144 researchers engaged in 40 research projects supported by IBES. Projects are supported through seed funding.

=== Test Bed ===
The Test Bed is a core part of IBES' research. The Test Bed consists of end user, access, aggregation and transport components. These interconnect with typical retail service provider equipment. The equipment can be configured in a variety ways to allow almost any network topology and architecture to be simulated.

The end user component consists of passive optical network (PON) optical network termination devices - the customer end points of the [[fibre to the premises]] network. The Test Bed also houses examples of end user devices found in the home or office, such as 3D televisions, iPads, computers, notebooks and smart phones. Wireless routers, IPTV set top boxes and media servers have been donated by Netgear.  Cisco has donated Telepresence video conferencing equipment.
There are a number of different passive optical network systems in the test-bed which have been donated by Huawei, Allied Telesis and NEC. The aggregation and transport network consists of Huawei equipment. The service edge component provides connectivity to the Internet and co-located applications such as video on demand media servers, as well as connectivity to off-site hardware and applications.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13950">In [[toxicology]], the '''lethal dose''' ('''LD''') is an indication of the lethal [[toxicity]] of a given substance or type of [[radiation]]. Because resistance varies from one individual to another, the "lethal dose" represents a dose (usually recorded as dose per kilogram of subject body weight) at which a given ''percentage'' of subjects will die. The lethal concentration is a lethal dose measurement used for gases or particulates. The LD may be based on the [[standard person]] concept, a theoretical individual that has perfectly "normal" characteristics, and thus not apply to all sub-populations.

==&lt;span id="LD50"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Median lethal dose (LD&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;)==
{{Main article|Median lethal dose}}
The median lethal dose, LD&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; (abbreviation for "lethal dose, 50%"), LC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; (lethal concentration, 50%) or LCt&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; (lethal concentration and time) of a [[toxin]], [[radiation]], or [[pathogen]] is the [[Dose (pharmacology)|dose]] required to kill half the members of a tested population after a specified test duration. LD&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; figures are frequently used as a general indicator of a substance's [[acute toxicity]].  A lower LD&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; is indicative of increased toxicity.

The test was created by J.W. Trevan in 1927.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ccohs.ca/oshanswers/chemicals/ld50.html What is an LD50 and LC50] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150626013647/http://www.ccohs.ca/oshanswers/chemicals/ld50.html |date=2015-06-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The term "semilethal dose" is occasionally used with the same meaning, in particular in translations from non-English-language texts, but can also refer to a ''sub''lethal dose; because of this ambiguity, it is usually avoided. LD&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; is usually determined by tests on animals such as [[laboratory mice]]. In 2011 the US [[Food and Drug Administration]] approved alternative methods to LD&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; for testing the cosmetic drug [[Botox]] without animal tests.&lt;ref&gt;

LD values for humans are best estimated by extrapolating results from human [[cell culture]]s. One form of measuring LD is to use animals like mice or rats, converting to dosage per kilogram of biomass, and extrapolating to human norms. The degree of error from animal-extrapolated LD values is large. The biology of test animals differs in important aspects to that of humans. For instance, mouse tissue is approximately fifty times less responsive than human tissue to the venom of the [[Sydney funnel-web spider]]{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}. The [[square-cube law]] also complicates the scaling relationships involved. Researchers are shifting away from animal-based LD measurements in some instances.  The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has begun to approve more non-animal methods in response to animal welfare concerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The LD&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; is usually expressed as the mass of substance administered per unit mass of test subject, typically as milli[[gram]]s of substance per [[kilogram]] of body mass, but stated as nanograms (suitable for [[botulinum]]), micrograms, milligrams, or grams (suitable for [[paracetamol]]) per kilogram. Stating it this way allows the relative toxicity of different substances to be compared, and normalizes for the variation in the size of the animals exposed, although toxicity does not always scale simply with body mass.

The choice of 50% lethality as a benchmark avoids the potential for ambiguity of making measurements in the extremes and reduces the amount of testing required. However, this also means that LD&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; is ''not'' the lethal dose for all subjects; some may be killed by much less, while others survive doses far higher than the LD&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;. Measures such as "LD&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;" and "LD&lt;sub&gt;99&lt;/sub&gt;" (dosage required to kill 1% or 99%, respectively, of the test population) are occasionally used for specific purposes.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/pdfs/97-119-a.pdf REGISTRY OF TOXIC EFFECTS OF CHEMICAL SUBSTANCES (RTECS)&lt;br&gt;COMPREHENSIVE GUIDE TO THE RTECS] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130516165953/http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/pdfs/97-119-a.pdf |date=2013-05-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lethal dosage often varies depending on the method of [[Drug administration|administration]]; for instance, many substances are less toxic when administered orally than when [[Intravenous therapy|intravenously]] administered. For this reason, LD&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; figures are often qualified with the mode of administration, e.g., "LD&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; i.v."

The related quantities LD&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;/30 or LD&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;/60 are used to refer to a dose that without treatment will be lethal to 50% of the population within (respectively) 30 or 60 days. These measures are used more commonly with [[radiation]], as survival beyond 60 days usually results in recovery.

=== Median infective dose ===
The median infective dose (ID&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;) is the number of organisms received by a person or test animal qualified by the route of administration (e.g., 1,200 org/man per oral).  Because of the difficulties in counting actual organisms in a dose, infective doses may be expressed in terms of biological assay, such as the number of LD&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;'s to some test animal.  In [[biological warfare]] infective dosage is the number of infective doses per minute for a cubic meter (e.g., ICt&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; is 100 medium doses - min/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;).)

==&lt;span id="LDLo"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Lowest lethal dose==
The lowest lethal dose (LD&lt;sub&gt;Lo&lt;/sub&gt;) is the least amount of drug that can produce death in a given animal species under controlled conditions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ccohs.ca/oshanswers/chemicals/ld50.html What is an LD50 and LC50] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150626013647/http://www.ccohs.ca/oshanswers/chemicals/ld50.html |date=2015-06-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dosage is given per unit of bodyweight (typically stated in [[milligram]]s per [[kilogram]]) of a substance known to have resulted in fatality in a particular species. When quoting an LD&lt;sub href="toxicology"&gt;Lo&lt;/sub&gt;, the particular species and method of administration (''e.g.'' ingested, inhaled, [[intravenous]]) are typically stated.

==&lt;span id="LC50"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Median lethal concentration==
For gases and aerosols, lethal concentration (given in mg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; or ppm, parts per million) is the analogous concept, although this also depends on the duration of exposure, which has to be included in the definition. The term incipient lethal level is used to describe a LC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; value that is independent of time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Fish Physiology: Euryhaline Fishes, Volume 32|last=Schultz|first=Eric|publisher=Academic Press|year=2013|isbn=978-0-12-396951-4|location=|pages=481–482}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A comparable measurement is LCt&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;, which relates to lethal dosage from exposure, where C is concentration and t is time. It is often expressed in terms of mg-min/m&lt;sup&gt;3.&lt;/sup&gt; LCt&lt;span style="font-size:100%;"&gt;&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/span&gt; is the dose that will cause incapacitation rather than death. These measures are commonly used to indicate the comparative efficacy of [[chemical warfare]] agents, and dosages are typically qualified by rates of breathing (e.g., resting = 10&amp;nbsp;l/min) for inhalation, or degree of clothing for skin penetration.  The concept of Ct was first proposed by [[Fritz Haber]] and is sometimes referred to as [[Haber's Law]], which assumes that exposure to 1 minute of 100&amp;nbsp;mg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; is equivalent to 10 minutes of 10&amp;nbsp;mg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; (1 × 100 = 100, as does 10 × 10 = 100).{{Citation needed|reason=A citation for what? 
There is a Wikipedia article about Haber''s law clearly linked to on the paragraph - please elaborate or remove this citation needed somebody, as I am not sure which to do.   Thank you.  date=April 2016|date=June 2017}}

Some chemicals, such as [[hydrogen cyanide]], are rapidly detoxified by the human body, and do not follow Haber's Law.  So, in these cases, the lethal concentration may be given simply as '''LC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;''' and qualified by a duration of exposure (e.g., 10 minutes). The [[Material Safety Data Sheet]]s for toxic substances frequently use this form of the term even if the substance does follow Haber's Law.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}

==&lt;span id="LCLo"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Lowest lethal concentration==
The LC&lt;sub&gt;Lo&lt;/sub&gt; is the lowest concentration of a chemical, given over a period of time, that results in the fatality of an individual animal. LC&lt;sub&gt;Lo&lt;/sub&gt; is typically for an acute (&lt;24 hour) exposure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title = Encyclopedia of Genetics, Genomics, Proteomics and Informatics |year = 2008 |url = https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007%2F978-1-4020-6754-9_9257 |isbn = 978-1-4020-6754-9 |publisher = Springer |doi = 10.1007/978-1-4020-6754-9_9257}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.utexas.edu/safety/ehs/msds/glossary/?page=l |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-05-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150621230708/http://www.utexas.edu/safety/ehs/msds/glossary/?page=l |archivedate=2015-06-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is related to the LC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;, the median lethal concentration. The LC&lt;sub&gt;Lo&lt;/sub&gt; is used for gases and aerosolized material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ilpi.com/msds/ref/lclo.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-05-31 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150619091119/http://www.ilpi.com/msds/ref/lclo.html |archivedate=2015-06-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Limitations ==
As a measure of toxicity, lethal dose is somewhat unreliable and results may vary greatly between testing facilities due to factors such as the genetic characteristics of the sample population, animal species tested, environmental factors and mode of administration.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Ernest Hodgson (2004). ''A Textbook of Modern Toxicology''. Wiley-Interscience (3rd ed.).{{page needed|date=January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There can be wide variability between species as well; what is relatively safe for rats may very well be extremely toxic for humans (''cf.'' [[paracetamol toxicity]]), and vice versa. For example, chocolate, comparatively harmless to humans, is known to be [[Health effects of chocolate#Potential toxicity in animals|toxic to many animals]]. When used to test [[venom]] from venomous creatures, such as [[snakes]], LD&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; results may be misleading due to the physiological differences between mice, rats, and humans. Many [[venomous snakes]] are specialized predators of mice, and their venom may be adapted specifically to incapacitate mice; and [[mongoose]]s may be exceptionally resistant. While most [[mammals]] have a very similar physiology, LD&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; results may or may not have equal bearing upon every mammal species, including humans.

== Animal rights concerns ==
[[Animal rights|Animal-rights]] and [[Animal welfare|animal-welfare]] groups, such as Animal Rights International,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ari-online.org/main.html Thirty-Two Years of Measurable Change] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070211201203/http://www.ari-online.org/main.html |date=2007-02-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; have campaigned against LD&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; testing on animals in particular as, in the case of some substances, causing the animals to die slow, painful deaths. Several countries, including the [[United Kingdom|UK]], have taken steps to ban the oral LD&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;, and the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD) abolished the requirement for the oral test in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title = Death of LD50 |journal = Trends in Pharmacological Sciences |volume = 22 |date = February 1, 2001 |first = David |last = Cutler |doi = 10.1016/S0165-6147(00)01627-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Robert N.

==Background==
=== Donald Trump ===
In 2012, [[Donald Trump]] referred to [[climate change]] as a hoax.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Alcorn |first=Chauncey |url=https://mic.com/articles/174536/march-for-science-dc-what-to-know-about-the-april-2017-march-on-washington |title=March for Science DC: What to know about the April 2017 march on Washington |work=Mic |date=April 19, 2017 |accessdate=April 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a presidential candidate,&lt;ref name="Lucky Tran"&gt;{{YouTube|ngD8l-n6Jck|Lucky Tran and the March for Science}} published on Apr 21, 2017 [[The National (TV program)|The National]] - [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]]&lt;/ref&gt; he promised to resume construction of the [[Keystone XL Pipeline]] and roll back [[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) regulations adopted by the [[Obama administration]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first1=Ashley |last1=Parker |first2=Coral |last2=Davenport |date=May 26, 2016 |title=Donald Trump's Energy Plan: More Fossil Fuels and Fewer Rules |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/27/us/politics/donald-trump-global-warming-energy-policy.html |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=February 21, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Trump's election, his [[Presidential transition of Donald Trump|transition team]] sought out specific [[U.S. Department of Energy]] (DOE) employees who had worked on climate change during the Obama administration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2016/12/09/trump-transition-team-for-energy-department-seeks-names-of-employees-involved-in-climate-meetings/ |title=Trump transition team for Energy Department seeks names of employees involved in climate meetings |work=Washington Post |accessdate=February 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to Trump's inauguration, many climate scientists began downloading climate data from government websites that they feared might be deleted by the Trump administration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2016/12/13/scientists-are-frantically-copying-u-s-climate-data-fearing-it-might-vanish-under-trump/ |title=Scientists are frantically copying U.S. climate data, fearing it might vanish under Trump |work=Washington Post |accessdate=February 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other actions taken or promised by the [[Trump administration]] inspired the march, including pulling out of the [[Paris Agreement]],&lt;ref name=NetburnFrontier&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.latimes.com/science/sciencenow/la-sci-scientists-politics-trump-20170209-story.html |title=Science entering a new frontier: Politics |first=Deborah |last=Netburn |work=Los Angeles Times |date=February 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; the stances of his [[Cabinet of Donald Trump|Cabinet nominees]], the freezing of research grants,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/scientists-are-planning-the-next-big-washington-march/ |title=Scientists Are Planning the Next Big Washington March: In just two days, more than 300,000 people join a Facebook planning group |first=Brian |last=Kahn |work=Scientific American |date=January 26, 2017 |accessdate=January 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a [[gag order]] placed on scientists in the EPA regarding dissemination of their research findings.&lt;ref name="TWPGoingToProtest"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/speaking-of-science/wp/2017/01/24/are-scientists-going-to-march-on-washington/ |title=Are scientists going to march on Washington? |first=Sarah |last=Kaplan |work=[[The Washington Post]] |date=January 25, 2017 |accessdate=January 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/316023-scientists-are-planning-their-own-march-on-washington |title=Scientists are planning their own march on Washington |first=Paulina |last=Firozi |work=[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]] |date=January 25, 2017 |accessdate=January 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theverge.com/2017/1/25/14382514/scientists-march-on-washington-donald-trump-science-gag-order-epa |title=Scientists plan to march on Washington and run for office to fight Trump |first=Loren |last=Grush |work=[[The Verge]] |date=January 25, 2017 |accessdate=January 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2017, [[William Happer]], a possible Trump science advisor with [[List of scientists opposing the mainstream scientific assessment of global warming|skeptical views on human caused global warming]], described an area of climate science as "really more like a cult" and its practitioners "glassy-eyed".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/feb/15/trump-science-adviser-william-happer-climate-change-cult |title=Trump's likely science adviser calls climate scientists 'glassy-eyed cult' |author=Hannah Devlin |date=February 15, 2017 |work=The Guardian |accessdate=February 20, 2017 |via=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[ScienceInsider]]'' reported Trump's first budget request as "A grim budget day for U.S. science" because it contained major funding cuts to [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|NOAA]]'s research and satellite programs, the EPA's Office of Research and Development, the DOE's [[Office of Science]] and energy programs, the [[United States Geological Survey|U.S. Geological Survey]], the [[National Institutes of Health]], and other science agencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2017/03/trumps-first-budget-analysis-and-reaction |title=A grim budget day for U.S. science: analysis and reaction to Trump's plan |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |publisher=[[American Association for the Advancement of Science|AAAS]] |date=March 16, 2017 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===International solidarity===
International sister marches were planned for countries around the world. These both supported American scientists and climate scientists more generally, and protested against other impingements on academic freedom internationally, such as government action against the [[Central European University]] in Hungary and the [[List of educational institutions closed in the 2016 Turkish purges|closure of educational institutes]] and dismissal of academics in the [[2016–17 Turkish purges]], as well as local issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2017/04/marchers-around-world-tell-us-why-theyre-taking-streets-science |title=Marchers around the world tell us why they're taking to the streets for science |date=13 April 2017 |accessdate=24 April 2017 |newspaper=Science}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before April, enthusiasts found existing knitting patterns for a hat shaped like a brain and proposed it as a symbol of solidarity for the march in analogy with the [[pussyhat]] project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.racked.com/2017/4/11/15166094/march-for-science-hat-pussyhat-brain-resistor-dna |title=The March for Science searches for its pussyhat |first=Elizabeth |last=Preston |publisher=Racked |date=April 11, 2017 |accessdate=April 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
[[File:Lydia Villa-Komaroff.jpg |thumb |[[Lydia Villa-Komaroff]]]]Professor [[Robert N. Proctor|Robert Proctor]] of [[Stanford University]] said that the March for Science was similar to other efforts by scientists such as [[Physicians for Social Responsibility]]; however, the scale was larger because "there's a broader perception of a massive attack on sacred notions of truth that are sacred to the scientific community."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.idahostatesman.com/news/politics-government/article146169319.html |title=Historians say the March for Science is 'pretty unprecedented' |work=idahostatesman |access-date=April 22, 2017 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:March_for_Science_2017_El_Paso.jpg |thumb|Organizers and some participants of the El Paso March for Science, April 22, 2017 |alt=Organizers and some participants of the El Paso March for Science, April 22, 2017]]

===Support===
On January 26, 2017, U.S. Senator [[Bernie Sanders]] of Vermont expressed his support for the march, congratulating "those scientists and researchers who are fighting back".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Firozi |first1=Paulina |title=Sanders applauds scientists 'fighting back' with planned DC march |url=http://thehill.com/homenews/senate/316453-sanders-backs-scientists-fighting-back-with-planned-march-in-dc-science-is |work=The Hill |date=January 27, 2017 |accessdate=February 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; U.S. Representative Bill Foster of Illinois, a physicist and the only current member of Congress with a Ph.D. in a [[natural sciences]] field, will join the march, "not as a Democratic member of Congress, but as a scientist."&lt;ref name="Gacher"&gt;Lev Gacher, [https://www.statnews.com/2017/04/05/bill-foster-scientist-congress-march/ Congress's one PhD-trained scientist will join march on Washington], ''[[Stat (website)|Stat]] (April 5, 2017).&lt;/ref&gt; Foster said that he viewed the march as political, but not partisan, saying, "if you see a specific policy that is inconsistent with the known principles of science, every citizen who is also a scientist should speak out."&lt;ref name="Gacher"/&gt;

In February the AAAS and other science groups announced their support for the march.&lt;ref name="KaplanNye"/&gt; [[Rush Holt Jr.]], the chief executive officer of the AAAS, expressed support for scientist involvement in politics.&lt;ref name="Ghosh"/&gt; Holt also emphasizes the importance of "appreciation for and understanding of science in the general population".&lt;ref name="Distillations"/&gt;

===Criticism===
The march received a torrent of criticism from [[conservatism in the United States|conservative]] publications for the perceived [[left-wing politics|left-wing]] bias and orientation of the event.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/apr/21/march-science-comes-under-microscope-over-left-til/]&lt;/ref&gt; A number of scientists voiced concerns over the march. [[Sylvester James Gates]] warned that "such a politically charged event might send a message to the public that scientists are driven by ideology more than by evidence".&lt;ref name=BLOOMsome&gt;{{cite news |last1=Flam |first1=Faye |authorlink1=Faye Flam |title=Why Some Scientists Won't March for Science |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2017-03-07/why-some-scientists-won-t-march-for-science |accessdate=March 8, 2017 |work=[[Bloomberg View]] |date=March 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Climate change denier [[William Happer]]&lt;ref&gt;Hannah Devlin, [https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/feb/15/trump-science-adviser-william-happer-climate-change-cult Trump's likely science adviser calls climate scientists 'glassy-eyed cult'], ''The Guardian'', February 15, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; stated that "there's no reason to assume the president is against science" while regarding the march.&lt;ref name=BLOOMsome/&gt; Writing in the ''[[New York Times]]'', [[Robert S. Young]] argued that the march will "reinforce the narrative from skeptical conservatives that scientists are an interest group and politicize their data, research and findings for their own ends" and that it would be better for scientists to "march into local civic groups, churches, county fairs and, privately, into the offices of elected officials."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Young |first1=Robert S. |authorlink1=Robert S.

In his opinion this will mean that the March will only deepen "partisan differences, while jeopardizing trust and impartiality and credibility of scientists". Regardless of assurances by the March's organizers that this would be non-political, it clearly was. Nisbet feels that confidence in scientists is strong, and they should "use this capital wisely and effectively".&lt;ref name="Nisbet 2017"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Nisbet |first1=Matthew |title=The March for Science: Partisan Protests Put Public Trust in Scientists at Risk |journal=Skeptical Inquirer |date=2017 |volume=41 |issue=4 |pages=18–19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Responding to criticism surrounding the political nature of the march, meteorologist and columnist [[Eric Holthaus]] wrote that the scientific field "has always been political" and referred to the example of Galileo Galilei's [[Galileo affair|confrontation with the political order]]. Holthaus wrote that the scientists must also protest when "truth itself is being called into question".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Holthaus |first1=Eric |title=The March for Science Isn't 'Political'—It's a Defense of Basic Truth |url=https://psmag.com/the-march-for-science-isnt-political-it-s-a-defense-of-basic-truth-4aaf89ebbd4b#.lkbs4lmc6 |accessdate=March 9, 2017 |work=Pacific Standard |date=February 1, 2017 }}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Discussing science’s role in policy and government, Rush Holt points out a [[fallacy]] in viewing science and politics as philosophically incompatible: "The ethic in the profession is that you stick to your science, and if you’re interested in how science affects public policy or public questions, just let the facts speak for themselves. Of course, there’s a fallacy there, too. Facts are, by themselves, voiceless."&lt;ref name="Distillations"/&gt;

San Francisco Lead Organizer Kristen Ratan debated [[Jerry Coyne]] on [[KQED |KQED's]] Forum&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://ww2.kqed.org/forum/2017/04/20/scientists-across-the-nation-trade-in-lab-coats-for-protest-signs |title=Scientists Across the Nation Trade in Lab Coats for Protest Signs |author= |date= |work=kqed.org |accessdate=April 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.podtrac.com/pts/redirect.mp3/www.kqed.org/.stream/mp3splice/radio//2017/04/Forum20170422a.mp3&lt;/ref&gt; regarding his criticism of the March and remarked that the millennial generation is just finding its feet with regard to activism and should be encouraged. Ratan also distinguished between being political and being partisan and suggested that while the March for Science is a political act, it is by no means partisan, which implies blind allegiance to one party over another. Ratan reiterated that the March For Science supports evidence-based policy-making regardless of party or affiliation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="29145">A '''microbeam''' is a narrow beam of [[radiation]], of [[micrometre|micrometer]] or sub-micrometer dimensions. Together with integrated imaging techniques, microbeams allow precisely defined quantities of damage to be introduced at precisely defined locations. Thus, the microbeam is a tool for investigators to study intra- and inter-cellular mechanisms of damage [[signal transduction]].

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:microbeam-schematic.jpg|frame|right|Schematic of a microbeam.]] --&gt;A schematic of microbeam operation is shown on the right. Essentially, an automated imaging system locates user-specified targets, and these targets are sequentially irradiated, one by one, with a highly-focused radiation beam. Targets can be [[cell (biology)|single cells]], [[organelle|sub-cellular locations]], or precise locations in 3D tissues. Key features of a microbeam are throughput, [[accuracy and precision|precision, and accuracy]]. While irradiating targeted regions, the system must guarantee that adjacent locations receive no energy deposition.

== History ==
The first microbeam facilities were developed in the mid-90s. These facilities were a response to challenges in studying radiobiological processes using broadbeam exposures. Microbeams were originally designed to address two main issues:&lt;ref name="Michael94"&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 7908938 | volume=65 | title=Meeting report: microbeam probes of cellular radiation response, 4th L.H. Gray Workshop, 8-10 July 1993 | date=April 1994 | journal=Int. J. Radiat. Biol. | pages=503–8 | last1 = Michael | first1 = BD | last2 = Folkard | first2 = M | last3 = Prise | first3 = KM | doi=10.1080/09553009414550581}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# The belief that the radiation-sensitivity of the [[cell nucleus|nucleus]] was not uniform, and
# The need to be able to hit an individual cell with an exact number (particularly one) of particles for low dose risk assessment.

Additionally, microbeams were seen as ideal vehicles to investigate the mechanisms of radiation response.

=== Radiation-sensitivity of the cell ===
At the time it was believed that radiation damage to cells was entirely the result of damage to [[DNA]]. Charged particle microbeams could probe the radiation sensitivity of the nucleus, which at the time appeared not to be uniformly sensitive. Experiments performed at microbeam facilities have since shown the existence of a [[bystander effect]]. A bystander effect is any biological response to radiation in cells or tissues that did not experience a radiation traversal. These "bystander" cells are neighbors of cells that have experienced a traversal. The mechanism for the bystander effect is believed to be due to cell-to-cell communication. The exact nature of this communication is an area of active research for many groups.

=== Irradiation with an exact number of particles ===
At the low doses of relevance to environmental radiation exposure, individual cells only rarely experience traversals by an ionizing particle and almost never experience more than one traversal. For example, in the case of domestic [[radon]] exposure, [[cancer]] risk estimation involves epidemiological studies of uranium miners. These miners inhale radon gas, which then undergoes [[radioactive decay]], emitting an [[alpha particle]] This alpha particle traverses the cells of the bronchial epithelium, potentially causing cancer.  The average lifetime radon [[Radiation poisoning|exposure]] of these miners is high enough that cancer risk estimates are driven by data on individuals whose target bronchial cells are subjected to multiple alpha particle traversals. On the other hand, for an average house occupant, about 1 in 2,500 target bronchial cells will be exposed per year to a single alpha particle, but less than 1 in 10&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; of these cells will experience traversals by more than one particle. Therefore, in order to extrapolate from miner to environmental exposures, it is necessary to be able to extrapolate from the effects of multiple traversals to the effects of single traversals of a particle.

Due to the [[Poisson distribution|random distribution]] of particle tracks, the biological effects of an exact number (particularly one) of particles cannot practically be simulated in the laboratory using conventional broadbeam exposures. Microbeam techniques can overcome this limitation by delivering an exact number (one or more) of particles per cell nucleus. True single-particle irradiations should allow measurement of the effects of exactly one alpha particle traversal, relative to multiple traversals. The application of such systems to low frequency processes such as [[oncogenic]] transformation depends very much on the technology involved. With an irradiation rate of at least 5,000 cells per hour, experiments with yields of the order of 10&lt;sup&gt;−4&lt;/sup&gt; can practically be accomplished. Hence, high throughput is a desired quality for microbeam systems.

== Charged particle microbeam ==
The first microbeam facilities delivered charged particles. A charged particle microbeam facility must meet the following basic requirements:&lt;ref name="Gerardi"&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 17132660 | doi=10.1093/rpd/ncl444 | volume=122 | title=A comparative review of charged particle microbeam facilities | year=2006 | journal=Radiat Prot Dosimetry | pages=285–91 | last1 = Gerardi | first1 = S}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# The beam spot size should be on the order of a few micrometres or smaller, corresponding to cellular or sub-cellular dimensions.
# Irradiations of living cells should take place at atmospheric pressure.
# Beam current must be reduced to levels such that targets may be irradiated with an exact number of particles with high [[reproducibility]].
# An imaging system is required to visualize and register cellular targets.
# Cell positioning must have high spatial resolution and [[reproducibility]] in order that the ion beam hit the target with a high degree of [[accuracy]] and [[Accuracy and precision|precision]].
# A [[particle detector]] with high efficiency must count the number of particles per target and switch off the beam after the desired number of particles have been delivered.
# Environmental conditions (humidity, for example) for cells must be maintained such that cells are under little or no [[stress (mechanics)|stress]].

=== ''Beam spot size'' ===
Beam spots with diameter down to about two micrometres can be obtained by [[collimator|collimating]] the beam with pinhole apertures or with a drawn capillary. Sub-micrometre beam spot sizes have been achieved by focusing the beam using various combinations of electrostatic or magnetic lenses. Both methods are used at present.

=== ''Vacuum window'' ===
A vacuum window is necessary in order to perform microbeam experiments on living cells. Generally, this is accomplished with the use of a vacuum-tight window of a [[polymer]] a few micrometres thick or 100-500&amp;nbsp;nm thick [[Silicon nitride]].

=== ''Cell registration and positioning'' ===
Cells must be identified and targeted with a high degree of accuracy. This can be accomplished using cell staining and [[fluorescence microscopy]] or without staining through the use of techniques such as quantitative phase microscopy or phase contrast microscopy. Ultimately, the objective is to recognize cells, target them, and move them into position for irradiation as fast as possible. Throughputs of up to 15,000 cells per hour have been achieved.

=== ''Particle counters'' ===
Particles must be counted with a high degree of detection efficiency in order to guarantee that a specific number of [[ions]] are delivered to a single cell. Generally, detectors can be placed before or after the target to be irradiated. If the detector is placed after the target, the beam must have sufficient energy to traverse the target and reach the detector. If the detector is placed before the target, the detector must have a minimal effect on the beam. When the desired number of particles are detected, the beam is either deflected or shut off.

=== ''Other considerations'' ===
Living cells must be maintained under conditions that do not [[stress (biological)|stress]] the cell, causing an unwanted biological response. Normally, cells must be attached to a [[Substrate (biology)|substrate]] so that their position can be determined by the imaging system. Recent advancements in beam position control and high speed imaging have made flow through systems possible ([[RARAF#Flow and Shoot|Flow and Shoot]]).

== X-ray microbeam ==
Some facilities have developed or are developing soft x-ray microbeams. In these systems, [[zone plate]]s are used to focus [[characteristic x-ray|characteristic x rays]] generated from a target hit by a charged particle beam.  When using synchrotron x-rays as a source, x-ray microbeam can be obtained by cutting the beam with a precise slit system due to high directionality of [[synchrotron radiation]].

== Biological endpoint ==
Many biological endpoints have been studied including [[oncogenic]] transformation, [[apoptosis]], [[mutations]], and [[chromosomal aberrations]].

== Microbeam Workshops ==
There have been nine international workshops, held approximately once every two years, on Microbeam Probes of Cellular Radiation Response. These workshops serve as an opportunity for microbeam personnel to come together and share ideas. The proceedings of the workshops serve as an excellent reference on the state of microbeam-related science.

[[Image:NAlogo.jpg|thumb|300px|The logo of Nicolas Appert]]

'''Nicolas Appert''' is a [[The Netherlands|Dutch]] study association for [[Food Technology]] students at [[Wageningen University]]. The association is named after the [[France|French]] inventor [[Nicolas Appert]], who can be seen as the first food technologist. The chef Nicolas Appert was researching ways to preserve food for a longer period of time and discovered that heating food products in a closed glass jar would greatly increase its shelflife. A process, nowadays called appertisation.

On September 6, 1962, during a foreign study trip, the study association Nicolas Appert was founded. Nowadays the association is still very active, having good relations with food companies and organising a lot of activities for its members.

Examples of these activities are lectures and excursions from and to food companies, but also social activities such as a sporting or drinks with the departments of Food Processing, Food Chemistry, Food Microbiology, Food Physics and Product Design and Quality Management. All these activities are made possible by the participation of a large group of active, enthusiastic students in committees and the board.

The '''no-observed-adverse-effect level (NOAEL)''' denotes the level of exposure of an [[organism]], found by [[experiment]] or [[observation]], at which there is no biologically or statistically [[Statistical significance|significant]] increase in the frequency or severity of any adverse effects (e.g. alteration of [[Morphology (biology)|morphology]], functional capacity, [[Human development (biology)|growth]], development or life span) in the exposed population when compared to its appropriate control. In non-clinical assessment, NOAEL plays a pivotal role. It is determined or proposed by qualified personnel (pharmacologist or toxicologist) depending on the study, drug indications and its pharmacological therapeutics side/adverse effects. NOAEL could be defined as "the highest experimental point that is without adverse effect," meaning that under laboratory conditions, it is the level where there is no side-effects. It either does not provide the effects of drug with respect to duration and dose, or it does not address the interpretation of risk based on toxicologically relevant effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Engelhardt JA|first1=Dorato MA|title=The no-observed-adverse-effect-level in drug safety evaluations: Use, issues, and definition(s)|journal=Regul Toxicol Pharmacol|date=August 2005|volume=42|issue=3|pages=265–274|doi=10.1016/j.yrtph.2005.05.004|pmid=15979222}}&lt;/ref&gt;
To say detail the NOAEL does not describe the duration, dose, or risk involved and is therefore more of a threshold marker. This is also known as highest no-effect level, or HNEL.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Marie |editor1-first=S. |editor2-last=Piggott | editor2-first=J.R. |date=July 2013| edition=1991 |title=Handbook of Sweeteners |url=https://www.springer.com/us/book/9781475753820 |access-date=February 5, 2018 |location=New York, New York, USA |publisher=Springer |page=279 |isbn= 978-1475753820 |archive-date=February 5, 2018 |archive-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-UP2BwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA279&amp;lpg=PA279&amp;dq=HNEL+highest+level&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=25JLOIE2H6&amp;sig=rUuML3qwEC_yMWOR1dodNxMCJ8I&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiUxZbRno_ZAhWHSBQKHW0jCo0Q6AEINDAC#v=onepage&amp;q=HNEL%20highest%20level&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bisphenol A.svg|thumb|right|[[Bisphenol A]] found in food and beverage packaging is an obesogen showing up in the bodies of about 95% of the human population.&lt;ref name = "Calafat_2005" /&gt;]]
'''Obesogens''' are foreign [[chemical compound]]s that disrupt normal [[human development (biology)|development]] and balance of [[lipid]] [[metabolism]], which in some cases, can lead to [[obesity]].&lt;ref name="Grün_2007"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid16690801"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Begley_2009"/&gt; Obesogens may be functionally defined as chemicals that inappropriately alter lipid [[Homeostasis#Biological|homeostasis]] and fat storage, change metabolic setpoints, disrupt energy balance or modify the regulation of [[appetite]] and [[satiety]] to promote fat accumulation and [[obesity]].&lt;ref name="Kirchner_2010"/&gt;

There are many different proposed mechanisms through which obesogens can interfere with the body's [[adipose tissue]] biology. These mechanisms include alterations in the action of metabolic sensors; dysregulation of [[sex steroid]] synthesis, action or breakdown; changes in the central integration of energy balance including the regulation of appetite and satiety; and reprogramming of metabolic setpoints.&lt;ref name="Grün_2009a"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Grün_2009b"/&gt; Some of these proposed pathways include inappropriate modulation of [[nuclear receptor]] function which therefore allows the compounds to be classified as [[endocrine disruptor|endocrine disrupting chemicals]] that act to mimic hormones in the body, altering the normal homeostasis maintained by the endocrine system.&lt;ref name="Diamanti-Kandarakis_2009"/&gt;

Obesogens have been detected in the body both as a result of intentional administration of obesogenic chemicals in the form of [[pharmaceutical drugs]] such as [[diethylstilbestrol]], [[selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor]], and [[thiazolidinedione]] and as a result of unintentional exposure to environmental obesogens such as [[tributyltin]], [[bisphenol A]], [[Bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate|diethylhexylphthalate]], and [[perfluorooctanoic acid|perfluorooctanoate]].&lt;ref name="Grün_2009a"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Grün_2009b"/&gt;

The term obesogen was coined in 2006 by Felix Grün and Bruce Blumberg of the [[University of California, Irvine]].&lt;ref name="pmid16690801"/&gt; The topic of this proposed class of chemical compounds and how to counteract their effects is explored at length in the book ''[[The New American Diet]]''. Paula Baillie-Hamilton,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.downtoearth.org.in/content/new-obesity Down To Earth: The new obesity]&lt;/ref&gt; a naturopath in the UK, hypothesized that obesogens make it difficult to [[weight loss|lose weight]] in the ''Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine'' in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ibarguchi.ca/teaching-CHEO/Baillie-Hamilton-Chems%20and%20obesity.pdf Chemical Toxins: A Hypothesis to Explain the Global Obesity Epidemic.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mechanisms of action ==

There are many ways in which obesogenic drugs and chemicals can disrupt the body's adipose tissue biology. The three main mechanisms of action include
* alterations in the action of metabolic sensors in which obesogens mimic metabolic [[Ligand (biochemistry)|ligands]] acting to either block or upregulate [[hormone receptors]]
* dysregulation of sex steroid synthesis, in which they alter the ratio of sex hormones leading to changes in their control of lipid balance
* changes in the central integration of [[energy balance (biology)|energy balance]] including the regulation of appetite and satiety in the brain and the reprogramming of metabolic setpoints.&lt;ref name="Grün_2009a"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Grün_2009b"/&gt;

=== Metabolic sensors ===

Obesogenic drugs and chemicals have been shown to target transcription regulators found in gene networks that function to control [[intracellular]] lipid homeostasis and proliferation and differentiation on adipocytes. The major group of regulators that is targeted is a group of nuclear hormone receptors known as [[peroxisome proliferator activated receptors]] (PPARα, δ, and γ). These hormone receptors sense a variety of metabolic ligands including lipophilic hormones, dietary fatty acids and their metabolites, and, depending on the varying levels of these ligands, control transcription of genes involved in balancing the changes in lipid balance in the body.&lt;ref name="Grün_2009a"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Grün_2009b"/&gt; To become active and properly function as metabolic sensors and transcription regulators, the PPAR receptors must [[heterodimerize]] with another receptor known as the 9-cis [[retinoic acid receptor]] (RXR). The RXR receptor itself is the second major target of obesogens next to the PPAR receptors.&lt;ref name="Grün_2009a"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Grün_2009b"/&gt;

The PPARα receptor, when complexed with RXR and activated by the binding of a lipid, promotes [[peroxisome]] proliferation leading to increased fatty acid β-oxidation.&lt;ref name="Ferré_2004"/&gt; Substances, such a [[xenobiotics]] that target and act as agonists of PPARα, typically act to reduce overall serum concentrations of lipids. In contrast, the PPARγ receptor, when complexed with RXR and activated by the binding of fatty acids or their derivatives, promotes lipid biosynthesis and storage of lipids is favored over fatty acid oxidation. In addition, activation promotes differentiation of [[preadipocytes]] and the conversion of mesenchymal [[progenitor cells]] to preadipocytes in adipose tissues. Substances that target and act as agonists of PPARγ/RXR complex typically act to increase overall serum concentrations of lipids.&lt;ref name="Rosen_1999"/&gt;

Obesogens that target the PPARγ/RXR complex mimic the metabolic ligands and activate the receptor leading to upregulation of lipid accumulation which explains their obesogenic effects. However, in the case of obesogens that target the PPARα/RXR complex, which when stimulated reduces adipose mass and body weight, there are a few explanations as to how they promote obesity.&lt;ref name="Grün_2009a"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Grün_2009b"/&gt;

The ligand binding pockets of PPARs are very large and unspecified, allowing for different [[isoforms]] of the receptor (PPARα, δ, and γ) to be activated by the same agonist ligands or their metabolites. In addition, fatty acid oxidation stimulated by [[PPARα]] requires continuous stimulation while only a single activation event of [[PPARγ]] is required to permanently increase adipocyte differentiation and number.&lt;ref name="Grün_2009a"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Grün_2009b"/&gt; Therefore, it may be the case that metabolites of PPARα targeting obesogens are also activating PPARγ, providing the single activation event needed to potentially lead to a pro-adipogenic response.&lt;ref name="Hurst_2003"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Feige_2007"/&gt;

A second explanation points to specific PPARα targeters that have been shown to additionally cause abnormal transcriptional regulation of testicular [[steroidogenesis]] when introduced during fetal development. This abnormal regulation leads to a decreased level of [[androgen]] in the body which, itself, is obesogenic.&lt;ref name="Parks_2000"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jarfelt_2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Braga-Basaria_2006"/&gt;

Finally, if PPARα activation occurs during critical periods of development, the resulting decrease in lipid concentration in the developing fetus is recognized by the fetal brain as undernourishment. In this case, the developing brain makes what will become permanent changes to the body's metabolic control, leading to long-term upregulation of lipid storage and maintenance.&lt;ref name="Levin_2006"/&gt;

=== Sex steroid dysregulation ===

Sex steroids normally play a significant role in lipid balance in the body. Aided by other peptide hormones such as [[growth hormone]], they act against the lipid accumulation mediated by insulin and cortisol by mobilizing lipid stores that are present. Exposure to obesogens often leads to a deficiency or change in the ratio between androgen and estrogen sex steroid levels, which modifies this method of lipid balance resulting in lowered growth hormone secretion, hypocortisolemia (low levels of circulating cortisol), and increased resistance to insulin effects.&lt;ref name="Bjorntorp_1997"/&gt;

This alteration in sex steroid levels due to obesogens can vary enormously according to both the sex of the exposed individual as well as the timing of the exposure.&lt;ref name="Grün_2009a"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Grün_2009b"/&gt; If the chemicals are introduced at critical windows of development, the vulnerability of an individual to their effects is much higher than if exposure occurs later in adulthood. It has been shown that obesogenic effects are apparent in female mice exposed to both phytoestrogens and DES during their neonatal periods of development, as they, though born with a lower birth weight, almost always developed obesity, high leptin levels, and altered glucose response pathways.&lt;ref name="Ruhlen_2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Newbold_2007a"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Newbold_2007b"/&gt; Both phytoestrogen and DES exposed male mice did not develop obesity and, rather, showed decreased body weights with increased exposure confirming the role of gender differences in exposure response.&lt;ref name="Newbold_2007a"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Newbold_2007b"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Penza_2006"/&gt; Further studies have shown positive correlations for serum BPA levels with obese females in the human population, along with other xenoestrogen compounds suggesting the parallel roles that these effects may be having on humans.&lt;ref name="Takeuchi_2004"/&gt;

=== Central balance of energy ===

While hormone receptors tend to be the most obvious candidates for targets of obesogens, central mechanisms that balance and regulate the body's nutritional changes on a day-to-day basis as a whole cannot be overlooked. The [[HPA axis]] (hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal) is involved in controlling appetite and energy homeostasis circuits which are mediated by a large number of monoaminoergic, peptidergic (use of hormones as neurotransmitters), and [[endocannabinoid]] signals that come from the digestive tract, adipose tissues, and from within the brain. It is these types of signals that provide a likely target for obesogens that have shown to have weight altering effects:&lt;ref name="Grün_2009a"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Grün_2009b"/&gt;

==== Neuroendocrine effects ====

Neurological disorders may enhance the susceptibility to develop the [[metabolic syndrome]] that includes obesity.&lt;ref name="Casey_2005"/&gt; Many neuropharmaceuticals used to alter behavioral pathways in patients with neurological disorders have shown to have metabolic altering side-effects leading to obesogenic phenotypes as well. These findings give evidence to conclude that an increase in lipid accumulation can result from the targeting of neurotransmitter receptors by foreign chemicals.&lt;ref name="Grün_2009a"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Grün_2009b"/&gt; (''See also:'' [[#Central integration of energy balance|section "Central integration of energy balance"]].)

==== Peptidergic hormones ====

Several peptidergic hormone pathways controlling appetite and energy balance —such as those involving [[ghrelin]], [[neuropeptide Y]], and [[agouti-related peptide]] — are particularly sensitive to changes in nuclear receptor signaling pathways and can therefore be easily altered by the introduction of [[endocrine disruptor]]s. Such an alteration can lead to induced feelings of hunger and decreased feelings of fullness causing an increase in food intake and inability to feel satisfied, both characteristic of obesity.&lt;ref name="Grün_2009a"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Grün_2009b"/&gt;

Some xenoestrogens such as [[Bisphenol A|BPA]], [[nonylphenol]], and [[DEHP]] have all shown to act is this way, altering [[NPY]] expression and significantly shifting the feeding behaviors of exposed mice.&lt;ref name="Masuo_2004a"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Masuo_2004b"/&gt; In addition, [[organotin]]s such as trimethyltin (TMT) triethyltin (TET), and [[tributyltin]] (TBT) compounds can exert their effects through similar pathways. TBT can locally disrupt [[aromatase]] regulation in the [[hypothalamus]] causing the responses of the HPA axis to hormones to become abnormal. TMT works in a similar but unique way, inducing [[NPY]] and NPY2 receptor expression initially which later is counteracted by neuronal degeneration in lesions causing decrease in signaling ability.&lt;ref name="Ishikura_2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sadamatsu_1998"/&gt;

While an increase in food intake is often the case after exposure, weight gain involves the body's maintenance of its metabolic setpoint as well. Given this information, it is particularly important to note that exposure during development and initial programming of these setpoints can be extremely significant throughout the remainder of life.&lt;ref name="Grün_2009a"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Grün_2009b"/&gt;

==== Endocannabinoid signaling ====

A wide range of environmental organotins that mimic petidergic hormones in the HPA axis as mentioned before, additionally mimic lipid activators of the [[cannabinoid]] system and inhibit [[AMP-activated protein kinase|AMPK]] activity.&lt;ref name="Grün_2009a"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Grün_2009b"/&gt; Endocannaboid levels are high in those suffering from obesity due to hyperactivity of cannaboid signalling pathways. It is these high levels that have been found to be closely associated with increased fat stores linking the lipid activator mimics to the actual disease.&lt;ref name="Engeli_2005"/&gt;

==== Programming of metabolic set points ====

Regions in the [[hypothalamus]] control the responses that establish an individuals metabolic setpoint and metabolic efficiency. These responses are adaptive in that they vary according to the individual's needs, always working to restore the metabolic setpoint through the increase or decrease of metabolic functions depending on varying energy needs. Since it is adapted, it is expected that it would be able to achieve equilibrium if the lipid balance was altered by hormones via the mechanisms mentioned above. However, since obesogenic phenotypes persist, it can be concluded that adaptive response components of the hypothalamus may be a target of obesogens as well.&lt;ref name="Grün_2009a"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Grün_2009b"/&gt;

A person's body composition is very much predetermined before birth and changes rarely occur in adulthood. Adipocyte numbers increase during development and come to a plateau over time. After the plateau adipocytes become restricted to mostly [[hypertrophic]] growth and don't seem to change much in terms of cell number. This is demonstrated by the difficulty in altering [[somatotypes]] or more simply by the difficulty that goes along with trying to lose weight past a certain point.&lt;ref name="Janesick_2011"/&gt;

A particular study on [[PBDEs]], a commonly used chemical in flame retardants, made its role in altering the functions of the [[thyroid]] hormone axis apparent.&lt;ref name="Ellis-Hutchings_2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kuriyama_2007"/&gt; This finding leads to increased concern as neonatal thyroid status plays a large role in the integration of maternal environmental signals during development in the womb that is used for long-term body weight programming.&lt;ref name="Grün_2009a"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Grün_2009b"/&gt;

== Pharmaceutical obesogens ==

Obesogens detection in the body and resulting obesogenic effects can result as side effects from intentional administration of obesogenic chemicals in the form of pharmaceutical drugs. These pharmaceutical obesogens can show their effects through a variety of targets.

=== Metabolic sensors ===

[[Thiazolidinediones]] (TZD), [[rosiglitazone]], and [[pioglitazone]] are all used to treat [[diabetes]]. These drugs act as agonists of the PPAR-γ receptor leading to [[insulin]] sensitizing effects that can improve [[glycemic]] control and serum [[triglyceride]] levels.&lt;ref name="Goldberg_2007"/&gt; Despite the positive effects these chemicals can have in treating diabetes patients, administration also lead to unwanted PPAR-γ mediated side effects such as peripheral [[edema]] which can be followed by persistent weight gain if the drug is used over a long period of time. These side effects are particularly prominent in diabetes 2 patients, a disease that tends to result from an overabundance of adipose tissue.&lt;ref name="Larsen_2003"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rubenstrunk_2007"/&gt;

=== Sex steroid dysregulation ===

[[Diethylstilbestrol|DES]] is a synthetic estrogen that was once prescribed to women to decrease the risk of miscarriage until it was found to be causing abnormalities in exposed offspring. This same chemical has been shown to cause weight gain in female mice when exposed during neonatal development. While exposure didn't lead to an abnormal birth weight, significant weight gain occurred much later in adulthood.&lt;ref name="Newbold_2007a"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Newbold_2007b"/&gt;

=== Central integration of energy balance ===

[[SSRI]] (e.g. [[paroxetine]]), [[tricyclic antidepressants]] (e.g. [[amitriptyline]]), [[tetracyclic antidepressants]] (e.g. [[mirtazapine]]) and atypical [[antipsychotics]] (e.g. [[clozapine]]) are all neuropharmaceuticals that target neurotransmitter receptors that are involved with brain circuits that regulate behavior. Often the function of these receptors overlaps with metabolism regulation, such as that of the [[Histamine H1 receptor|H1 receptor]] which when activated decreases AMPK activity.&lt;ref name="Kim_2007"/&gt; As a result, the administration of these drugs can have side effects including increased lipid accumulation that can result in obesity.

=== Metabolic setpoints ===

The mechanisms behind SSRI, tricyclic antidepressants, and atypical antipsychotics function allow them all to have potential roles in the alteration of metabolic setpoints. TZD, in particular has been linked to regulatory function in the HPT axis, however, no conclusive evidence has been determined thus far and further research is required to confirm these hypotheses.&lt;ref name="Grün_2009a"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Grün_2009b"/&gt;

== Environmental obesogens ==

While obesogens can be introduced to the body intentionally via administration of obesogenic pharmaceuticals, exposure can also occur through chemical exposure to obesogens found in the environment such as organotins and xenobiotics.

=== Organotins ===

Particular members of the organotin class of [[persistent organic pollutants]] (POPs), namely [[tributyltin]] (TBT) and [[Triphenyltin compounds|triphenyltin]] (TPT) are highly selective and act as very potent agonists of both the retinoid X receptors (RXR α,β, and γ) and PPARγ.&lt;ref name="Kanayama_2005"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Grün_2006b"/&gt; This ability to target both receptors at the same time, is more effective than single receptor activation, as  adopogenic signaling can be mediated through both components of the heterodimer complex. This highly effective activation mechanism can pose detrimental, long-term adipogenic effects especially if exposure occurs during development and early life.

[[Organotin chemistry|Organotins]] (tin-based chemicals), used in marine anti-fouling paints, wood catalysts, plasticizers, slimicides, in industrial water systems, and fungicides on food have recently been linked to obesogenic properties when introduced in the body.&lt;ref name="Nath_2008"/&gt; Human exposure to these major environmental sources most commonly occurs through ingestion of contaminated seafood, agricultural products, and drinking water as well as from exposure to leaching from plastics.&lt;ref name="Tsuda_1995"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Guerin_2007"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ohno_2002"/&gt;

Although studies that have directly measured organotin levels in human tissue and blood are limited, it has been determined that vulnerability of a portion of the general population to organotin exposure at levels high enough to activate RXRs and PPARγ receptors is very probable. The high usage of organotins in both plastics and agricultural maintenance as well as the high affinity of the chemicals further confirms this conclusion.&lt;ref name="Grün_2009a"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Grün_2009b"/&gt;

Liver samples from the late 1990s in Europe and Asia contained on average 6 and 84&amp;nbsp;ng/g wet wt respectively for total organotin levels, while later studies found levels of total organotins in US blood samples averaged around 21&amp;nbsp;ng/mL with TBT comprising around 8&amp;nbsp;ng/mL (~ 27 nM).&lt;ref name="Kanaan_1999"/&gt; Even more recent analyses of European blood samples found the predominant species to be TPT rather than TBT at 0.09 and 0.67&amp;nbsp;ng/mL (~0.5-2 nM). Only occasional trace amounts of TBT were found.&lt;ref name="Rantakokko_2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lo_2003"/&gt; These results indicate that organtin exposure to humans, while found to be present among many different populations, can vary in terms of type of organatin and level of exposure from region to region.

=== Other xenobiotics ===

Other common [[xenobiotics]] found in the environment have been shown to have PPAR activity, posing even further threats to dysregulated metabolic balance. [[Bisphenol A|BPA]] from [[polycarbonate]] plastics, [[phthalate]] plasticizers used to soften PVC plastics, and various perfluoroalkyll compounds (PFCs) that are widely used surfactants and surface repellents in consumer products are all potentially obesogenic when introduced in the body.&lt;ref name="Grün_2009a"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Grün_2009b"/&gt; Phthalates and PFCs in particular have been found to function as agonists for one or more of the PPARs &lt;ref name="Bell_1982"/&gt; Additionally, metabolites of DHEP such as MEHP also activate PPARγ leading to a proadipogenic response.&lt;ref name="Hurst_2003"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Feige_2007"/&gt;

==Public health implications==

Although research on endocrine disruptors or "obesogens" is still emerging, the public health implications so far have mainly surrounded obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease.

Obesity has [[Epidemiology of obesity|become a global epidemic]], increasing for all population groups. From 1980 to 2008, the rates of obesity have doubled for adults and [[Epidemiology of childhood obesity|tripled for children]].&lt;ref name="urlObesity and Overweight for Professionals: Data and Statistics: Facts - DNPAO - CDC"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.cdc.gov/obesity/data/facts.html | title = Obesity and Overweight for Professionals: Data and Statistics: Facts - DNPAO - CDC | author = Centers for Disease Control and Prevention | date =  | publisher = U.S. Department of Health and human Services  }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the U.S. alone, it has been estimated that almost 100 million individuals in are obese&lt;ref name="pmid9813653"&gt;{{cite journal | title = Clinical Guidelines on the Identification, Evaluation, and Treatment of Overweight and Obesity in Adults--The Evidence Report.

The chronic burden of obesity doesn't stop with weight gain. It can also lead to potentially debilitating chronic diseases such as diabetes, and certain environmental exposures, or obesogens, have been directly linked to Type II diabetes mellitus (T2DM).&lt;ref name="Thayer_2012"/&gt; An estimated 25.8 million people, or 8.3% of the population in the US, have diabetes, and the crude prevalence of diagnosed diabetes increased by 176%, from 1980 through 2010.&lt;ref name="urlCDC - 2011 National Diabetes Fact Sheet - Publications - Diabetes DDT"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.cdc.gov/diabetes/pubs/factsheet11.htm | title = CDC - 2011 National Diabetes Fact Sheet - Publications - Diabetes DDT | author = Centers for Disease Control and Prevention | date = | publisher = U.S. Department of Health and human Services }}&lt;/ref&gt; The disease and economic burden of diabetes, which is the seventh leading cause of death in the United States costing approximately $174 billion annually, is being addressed by organizations such as Healthy People 2020 which has diabetes listed as one of their 42 objectives.&lt;ref name="urlwww.cdc.gov"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.cdc.gov/diabetes/statistics/prev/national/figage.htm | title = Crude and Age-Adjusted Percentage of Civilian, Noninstitutionalized Population with Diagnosed Diabetes, United States, 1980–2010 | author = Centers for Disease Control and Prevention | date =  | work = | publisher = U.S. Department of Health and human Services }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, diabetes is a major obstacle to overcome especially when obesogens might be the uncontrolled, unsuspected cause.

=== Potential obesogens in everyday life ===
Obesogens can be found everywhere, from water bottles to microwaveable popcorn, and from nonstick pans to shower curtains. People interact with them on a daily basis, both intentionally and unintentionally, at work, school and home. They are an unnecessary and mostly preventable potential hazard to health, which can have a large impact on how individuals gain and lose weight.

[[Bisphenol-A]] (BPA) is an industrial chemical and organic compound that has been used in the production of plastics and resins for over a half-century. It is used in products such as toys, medical devices, plastic food and beverage containers, shower curtains, dental sealants and compounds, and register receipts.&lt;ref name="pmid20517192"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Zeratsky K | title = What are the health concerns about BPA? | journal = Mayo Clinic Women's Healthsource | volume = 14 | issue = 7 | pages = 8 | date = Jul 2010 | pmid = 20517192 | doi =  | url = http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/bpa/AN01955 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  BPA has been shown to seep into food sources from containers or into the body just by handling products made from it. Certain researchers suggest that BPA actually decreases the fat cell count in the body, but at the same time increasing the size of the ones remaining; therefore, no difference in weight is shown, and an individual is even likely to gain more.&lt;ref name="pmid22249005"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Vom Saal FS, Nagel SC, Coe BL, Angle BM, Taylor JA | title = The estrogenic endocrine disrupting chemical bisphenol A (BPA) and obesity | journal = Molecular and Cellular Endocrinology | volume = 354 | issue = 1–2 | pages = 74–84 | date = May 2012 | pmid = 22249005 | doi = 10.1016/j.mce.2012.01.001 | pmc=3306519}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[High-fructose corn syrup]] (HFCS) is found in many food products on grocery store shelves: by 2004, for example, it accounted for 40% of caloric sweeteners added to foods and beverages sold in the United States, and was the only caloric sweetener used in soft drinks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last = Bray | first = GA |author2=Nielsen SJ |author3=Popkin BM | title = Consumption of high-fructose corn syrup in beverages may play a role in the epidemic of obesity | journal = American Journal of Clinical Nutrition | volume = 79 | issue = 4 | pages = 537–543 |  url = http://www.ajcn.org/cgi/content/full/79/4/537 | pmid = 15051594 | year = 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is used as a food and drink sweetener and is an obesogen. Acting on insulin and leptin in the body, HFCS potentially increases appetite and fat production.&lt;ref name="pmid22034869"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Stanhope KL | title = Role of fructose-containing sugars in the epidemics of obesity and metabolic syndrome | journal = Annual Review of Medicine | volume = 63 | issue =  | pages = 329–43 | year = 2012 | pmid = 22034869 | doi = 10.1146/annurev-med-042010-113026 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nicotine]] is the chemical found in tobacco products and certain insecticides. As an obesogen, nicotine mostly acts on prenatal development after [[Smoking and pregnancy|maternal smoking]] occurs. A strong association has been made between maternal smoking and childhood overweight/obesity, with nicotine as the single causal agent.&lt;ref name="Thayer_2012"/&gt;

[[Arsenic]] is a [[metalloid]] (''i.e.'', an element with some metallic properties) found in and on most naturally occurring substances on Earth. It can be found in the soil, ground water, air, and in small concentrations in food. Arsenic has many applications such as in the production of insecticides, herbicides, pesticides and electronic devices.&lt;ref name="epa_arsenic"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.epa.gov/teach/chem_summ/Arsenic_summary.pdf | title = Inorganic Arsenic | author = | date = 2007-08-01 | format = pdf | work = TEACH Chemical Summary | publisher = United States Environmental Protection Agency | pages = 20  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid21864395"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Del Razo LM, García-Vargas GG, Valenzuela OL, Castellanos EH, Sánchez-Peña LC, Currier JM, Drobná Z, Loomis D, Stýblo M | title = Exposure to arsenic in drinking water is associated with increased prevalence of diabetes: a cross-sectional study in the Zimapán and Lagunera regions in Mexico | journal = Environmental Health | volume = 10 | issue =  | pages = 73 | year = 2011 | pmid = 21864395 | pmc = 3169452 | doi = 10.1186/1476-069X-10-73 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The development of diabetes has been linked to arsenic exposure from drinking water and occupational contact.

[[Pesticides]] are substances used to prevent, destroy, repel or mitigate pests, and they have been used throughout all of recorded history. Some pesticides persist for short periods of time and some for long periods of time which are considered [[persistent organic pollutants]] (POPs). Several cross-sectional studies have shown pesticides as obesogens, linking them to obesity, diabetes and other morbidities.&lt;ref name="Thayer_2012"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid22372998"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lind L, Lind PM | title = Can persistent organic pollutants and plastic-associated chemicals cause cardiovascular disease? | journal = Journal of Internal Medicine | volume = 271 | issue = 6 | pages = 537–53 | date = Jun 2012 | pmid = 22372998 | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2796.2012.02536.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pharmaceutical drugs are also potentially obesogens. From 2005-2008, 11% of Americans aged 12 and over took antidepressant medications.&lt;ref name="pmid22617183"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Pratt LA, Brody DJ, Gu Q | title = Antidepressant use in persons aged 12 and over: United States, 2005-2008 | journal = NCHS Data Brief | volume =  | issue = 76 | pages = 1–8 | date = Oct 2011 | pmid = 22617183 | doi =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Certain antidepressants, known as [[SSRI|selectively serotonin reuptake inhibitors]] (SSRIs), are potentially adding to the almost 100 million obese individuals in the U.S.&lt;ref name="pmid9813653"/&gt; A key function of SSRI antidepressants is to regulate serotonin reuptake transporter (SERT) which can affect food intake and lipid accumulation leading to obesity.&lt;ref name="pmid22412882"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Chen X, Margolis KJ, Gershon MD, Schwartz GJ, Sze JY | title = Reduced serotonin reuptake transporter (SERT) function causes insulin resistance and hepatic steatosis independent of food intake | journal = PLOS ONE | volume = 7 | issue = 3 | pages = e32511 | year = 2012 | pmid = 22412882 | pmc = 3297606 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0032511 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Organotins]] such as [[tributyltin]] (TBT) and [[triphenyltin]] (TPT) are [[endocrine disruptors]] that have been shown to increase triglyceride storage in [[adipocytes]]. Although they have been widely used in the marine industry since the 1960s, other common sources of human exposure include contaminated seafood and shellfish, fungicides on crops and as antifungal agents used in wood treatments, industrial water systems and textiles. Organotins are also being used in the manufacture of PVC plastics and have been identified in drinking water and food supplies.&lt;ref name="pmid16690801" /&gt;
	
[[Perfluorooctanoic acid|Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA)]] is a surfactant used for reduction of friction, and it is also used in nonstick cookware. PFOA has been detected in the blood of more than 98% of the general US population.&lt;ref name="pmid22003309"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Shankar A, Xiao J, Ducatman A | title = Perfluoroalkyl chemicals and elevated serum uric acid in US adults | journal = Clinical Epidemiology | volume = 3 | issue =  | pages = 251–8 | year = 2011 | pmid = 22003309 | pmc = 3191115 | doi = 10.2147/CLEP.S21677 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a potential endocrine disruptor.&lt;ref name="pmid21397692"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = White SS, Fenton SE, Hines EP | title = Endocrine disrupting properties of perfluorooctanoic acid | journal = The Journal of Steroid Biochemistry and Molecular Biology | volume = 127 | issue = 1–2 | pages = 16–26 | date = Oct 2011 | pmid = 21397692 | pmc = 3335904 | doi = 10.1016/j.jsbmb.2011.03.011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Animal studies have shown that prenatal exposure to PFOA is linked to obesity when reaching adulthood.&lt;ref name="pmid19433254"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hines EP, White SS, Stanko JP, Gibbs-Flournoy EA, Lau C, Fenton SE | title = Phenotypic dichotomy following developmental exposure to perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) in female CD-1 mice: Low doses induce elevated serum leptin and insulin, and overweight in mid-life | journal = Molecular and Cellular Endocrinology | volume = 304 | issue = 1–2 | pages = 97–105 | date = May 2009 | pmid = 19433254 | doi = 10.1016/j.mce.2009.02.021 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Future research==

Most of the environmental obesogens currently identified are either classified into the category of chemical mimics of metabolic hormones throughout the body or of neurotransmitters within the brain. Because they fall into these two categories, extensive opportunities for complex interactions and varied sites of action as well as multiple molecular targets are open for consideration. Changing dose ranges tend to result in varying phenotypes and timing of exposure, gender, and gender predisposition introduce even more levels of complexity in how these substances effect the human body.&lt;ref name="Grün_2009a"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Grün_2009b"/&gt;

Because the mechanisms behind the different effects of obesogens are so complex and not well understood, the extent to which they play in the current obesity epidemic may be greater than once thought. [[Epigenetic]] changes due to obesogen exposure must also be considered as a possibility, as they open up the potential for misregulated metabolic functions to be passed on from generation to generation. Epigenetic processes via [[hypermethylation]] of regulatory regions could lead to overexpression of different proteins, and therefore, amplification of acquired environmental effects. Research will be required in order to gain a better understanding of the mechanism of action these chemicals are involved in before the extent of the risk of exposure can be determined and methods of prevention and removal from the environment can be established.&lt;ref name="Grün_2009a"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Grün_2009b"/&gt;

[[Image:Musicfirstaudioclassicpreamplifier.jpg|thumb|right|An example of a typical high-end [[Stereophonic sound|stereo]] preamplifier.]]

A '''preamplifier''' (preamp or "pre") is an [[electronic amplifier]] that converts a weak electrical [[Signalling (telecommunication)|signal]] into an output signal strong enough to be noise-tolerant and strong enough for further processing, or for sending to a [[power amplifier]] and a [[loudspeaker]]. Without this, the final signal would be noisy or distorted. They are typically used to amplify signals from analog sensors such as [[microphone]]s and [[pickup (guitar)|pickups]]. Because of this, the preamplifier is often placed close to the [[sensor]] to reduce the effects of [[Noise (electronics)|noise]] and [[Electromagnetic interference|interference]].

==Description==
An ideal preamp will be linear (have a constant [[Gain (electronics)|gain]] through its operating range), have high [[input impedance]] (requiring only a minimal amount of current to sense the input signal) and a low [[output impedance]] (when current is drawn from the output there is minimal change in the output voltage).  It is used to boost the signal strength to drive the cable to the main instrument without significantly degrading the [[signal-to-noise ratio]] (SNR). The noise performance of a preamplifier is critical. According to [[Friis formulas for noise|Friis's formula]], when the gain of the preamplifier is high, the SNR of the final signal is determined by the SNR of the input signal and the [[noise figure]] of the preamplifier.

Three basic types of preamplifiers are available:
* current-sensitive preamplifier
* [[parasitic capacitance|parasitic-capacitance]] preamplifier
* [[charge amplifier|charge-sensitive preamplifier]].

==Audio systems==
In an audio system, they are typically used to amplify signals from analog sensors to [[line level]]. The second amplifier is typically a [[power amplifier]] (power amp).  The preamplifier provides [[voltage]] gain (e.g., from 10 mV to 1 V) but no significant [[Electric current|current]] gain. The power amplifier provides the higher voltage necessary to drive [[loudspeaker]]s. For these systems some common sensors are [[microphone]]s, [[pickup (music technology)|instrument pickups]], and [[phonograph]]s. Preamplifiers are often integrated into the audio inputs on [[mixing console]]s, [[DJ mixer]]s, and [[sound card]]s. They can also be stand-alone devices.

==Misnomer== 
In a home [[audio system]], the term 'preamplifier' may sometimes be used to describe equipment which merely [[switch]]es between different [[line level]] sources and applies [[attenuation|volume control]] and possibly [[tone control circuit]]s. Such equipment prepares the signal before amplification but, in fact, no actual amplification circuitry may be involved.

== Examples ==
* The integrated preamplifier in a foil [[electret microphone]].
* The first stages of an [[instrument amplifier]], which is then sent to the power amplifier. With instrument amplifiers, the preamp is often designed to produce [[distortion (music)|overdrive]] or distortion effects.
* A stand-alone unit for use in [[live music]] and [[recording studio]] applications.
* As part of a stand-alone [[channel strip]] or channel strip built into an audio [[mixing desk]].
* A [[Radio masts and towers|masthead]] amplifier used with [[television]] receiver [[antenna (electronics)|antenna]] or a [[satellite]] [[Receiver (radio)|receiver]] dish.
* The circuit inside of a hard drive connected to the magnetic heads or the circuit inside of CD/DVD drive which connects to the [[photodiode]]s.
* A [[switched capacitor]] circuit used to null the effects of mismatch offset in most [[CMOS]] comparator-based flash [[analog-to-digital converter]]s

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13763">'''Predictability''' is the degree to which a correct [[prediction]] or [[forecasting|forecast]] of a [[system]]'s [[Classical mechanics|state]] can be made either qualitatively or quantitatively&lt;ref&gt;Simandan, D., 2018. Wisdom and foresight in Chinese thought: sensing the immediate future. Journal of Futures Studies. 22(3), pp. 35-50. https://doi.org/10.6531/JFS.2018.22(3).00A35 &lt;/ref&gt;.

==Predictability and Causality==
 
[[Causal determinism]] has a strong relationship with predictability&lt;ref&gt;Vespignani, A., 2012. Modelling dynamical processes in complex socio-technical systems. Nature physics, 8(1), p.32.&lt;/ref&gt;. Perfect predictability implies strict determinism, but lack of predictability does not necessarily imply lack of determinism&lt;ref&gt;Simandan D. 2010. Beware of contingency. Environment and planning. D: Society and Space, 28(3), pp. 388-396. https://doi.org/10.1068/d2310 
&lt;/ref&gt;. Limitations on predictability could be caused by factors such as a lack of information or excessive complexity&lt;ref&gt;Vespignani, A., 2009. Predicting the behavior of techno-social systems. Science, 325(5939), pp.425-428.&lt;/ref&gt;. 
 
In experimental physics, there are always observational errors determining variables such as positions and velocities. So perfect prediction is ''practically'' impossible. Moreover, in modern [[quantum mechanics]], [[Werner Heisenberg]]'s [[indeterminacy principle]] puts limits on the accuracy with which such quantities can be known. So such perfect predictability is also ''theoretically'' impossible. &lt;!-- [To the author: please, take care that the indeterminacy principle defines the state of a particle to be indetermined until it is observed and, therefore, if it is not observed it cannot be measured. It has nothing to do with the accuracy of measurement.] --&gt;

=== Laplace's Demon ===
[[Laplace's Demon]] is a supreme intelligence who could completely predict the one possible future given the Newtonian dynamical laws of classical physics and perfect knowledge of the positions and velocities of all the particles in the world. In other words, if it were possible to have every piece of data on every atom in the universe from the beginning of time, it would be possible to predict the behavior of every atom into the future. Laplace’s determinism is usually thought to be based on his mechanics, but he could not prove mathematically that mechanics is deterministic. Rather, his determinism is based on general philosophical principles, specifically on the principle of sufficient reason and the law of continuity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=van Strien|first=Marij|date=2014-03-01|title=On the origins and foundations of Laplacian determinism|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0039368113001325|journal=Studies in History and Philosophy of Science Part A|volume=45|issue=Supplement C|pages=24–31|doi=10.1016/j.shpsa.2013.12.003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In statistical physics==
Although the [[second law of thermodynamics]] can determine the [[equilibrium state]] that a system will evolve to, and [[steady state]]s in [[dissipative system]]s can sometimes be predicted, there exists no general rule to predict the [[time evolution]] of systems distanced from equilibrium, e.g. [[chaotic system]]s, if they do not approach an equilibrium state.  Their predictability usually deteriorates with time and to quantify predictability, the rate of divergence of system [[trajectory|trajectories]] in [[phase space]] can be measured ([[Kolmogorov–Sinai entropy]], [[Lyapunov exponent]]s).&lt;ref name="Boeing2016Systems"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Boeing, G.|title=Visual Analysis of Nonlinear Dynamical Systems: Chaos, Fractals, Self-Similarity and the Limits of Prediction|journal=Systems|date=2016|volume=4|issue=4|pages=37|doi=10.3390/systems4040037}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In mathematics==
In [[stochastic analysis]] a [[stochastic process|random process]] is a [[predictable process]] if it is possible to know the next state from the present time.

The branch of mathematics known as [[Chaos theory|Chaos Theory]] focuses on the behavior of systems that are highly sensitive to initial conditions. It suggests that a small change in an initial condition can completely alter the progression of a system. This phenomenon is known as the [[butterfly effect]], which claims that a butterfly flapping its wings in Brazil can cause a tornado in Texas.&lt;ref&gt;Boeing (2015). [http://geoffboeing.com/2015/03/chaos-theory-logistic-map/ "Chaos Theory and the Logistic Map"]. Retrieved 2015-07-16.&lt;/ref&gt; The nature of chaos theory suggests that the predictability of any system is limited because it is impossible to know all of the minutiae of a system at the present time. In principal, the deterministic systems that chaos theory attempts to analyze can be predicted, but uncertainty in a forecast increases exponentially with elapsed time.&lt;ref&gt; ''Sync: The Emerging Science of Spontaneous Order'', Steven Strogatz, Hyperion, New York, 2003, pages 189-190.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In human–computer interaction==
In the study of [[human–computer interaction]], predictability is the property to forecast the consequences of a user action given the current state of the system.

A contemporary example of human-computer interaction manifests in the development of computer vision algorithms for collision-avoidance software in self-driving cars. Researchers at NVIDIA Corporation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The AI Car Computer for Autonomous Driving|url=http://www.nvidia.com/object/drive-px.html|publisher=NVIDIA|accessdate=27 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Princeton University,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Chen|first1=Chenyi|title=Deep Learning for Self -driving Car|url=http://www.princeton.edu/~alaink/Orf467F14/Deep%20Driving.pdf|publisher=Princeton University|accessdate=27 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other institutions are leveraging deep learning to teach computers to anticipate subsequent road scenarios based on visual information about current and previous states.

Another example of human-computer interaction are computer simulations meant to predict human behavior based on algorithms. For example, MIT has recently developed an incredibly accurate algorithm to predict the behavior of humans. When tested against television shows, the algorithm was able to predict with great accuracy the subsequent actions of characters. Algorithms and computer simulations like these show great promise for the future of artificial intelligence.&lt;ref&gt;http://news.mit.edu/2016/teaching-machines-to-predict-the-future-0621&lt;/ref&gt;

==In human sentence processing==
{{Main |Prediction in language comprehension}}
Linguistic prediction is a phenomenon in [[psycholinguistics]] occurring whenever information about a word or other linguistic unit is activated before that unit is actually encountered. Evidence from [[eyetracking]], [[event-related potentials]], and other experimental methods indicates that in addition to integrating each subsequent word into the context formed by previously encountered words, language users may, under certain conditions, try to predict upcoming words. Predictability has been shown to affect both text and speech processing, as well as speech production. Further, predictability has been shown to have an effect on syntactic, semantic and pragmatic comprehension.

==In biology==
In the study of biology – particularly [[genetics]] and [[neuroscience]] – predictability relates to the prediction of biological developments and behaviors based on inherited genes and past experiences.

Significant debate exists in the scientific community over whether or not a person's behavior is completely predictable based on their genetics. Studies such as the one in Israel, which showed that judges were more likely to give a lighter sentence if they had eaten more recently.&lt;ref&gt;http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/notrocketscience/2011/04/11/justice-is-served-but-more-so-after-lunch-how-food-breaks-sway-the-decisions-of-judges/#.WcrXEq2ZP_Q&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to cases like this, it has been proven that individuals smell better to someone with complementary immunity genes, leading to more physical attraction.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/science/2009/may/24/genes-human-attraction&lt;/ref&gt; Genetics can be examined to determine if an individual is predisposed to any diseases, and behavioral disorders can most often be explained by analyzing defects in genetic code. Scientist who focus on examples like these argue that human behavior is entirely predictable. Those on the other side of the debate argue that genetics can only provide a predisposition to act a certain way and that, ultimately, humans possess the free will to choose whether or not to act.

Animals have significantly more predictable behavior than humans. Driven by natural selection, animals develop mating calls, predator warnings, and communicative dances. One example of these engrained behaviors is the Belding's ground squirrel, which developed a specific set of calls that warn nearby squirrels about predators. If a ground squirrel sees a predator on land it will elicit a trill after it gets to safety, which signals to nearby squirrels that they should stand up on their hind legs and attempt to locate the predator. When a predator is seen in the air, a ground squirrel will immediately call out a long whistle, putting himself in danger but signaling for nearby squirrels to run for cover. Through experimentation and examination scientists have been able to chart behaviors like this and very accurately predict how animals behave in certain situations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1007/BF00293209|title = Alarm calls of Belding's ground squirrels to aerial predators: Nepotism or self-preservation?|journal = Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology|volume = 17|issue = 4|pages = 313–323|year = 1985|last1 = Sherman|first1 = Paul W}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In popular culture ==
The study of predictability often sparks debate between those who believe humans maintain complete control over their free-will and those who believe our actions are predetermined. However, it is likely that neither [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] nor [[Pierre-Simon Laplace|Laplace]] saw the study of predictability as relating to determinism.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.informationphilosopher.com/freedom/predictability.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Techniques==
One example of prediction techniques is tarot cards. Tarot cards have been used for hundreds of years to help in determining the future. "Fortune tellers" have been traced through history back to the Ancient Egyptians, however the earliest complete record dates only to the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;http://science.howstuffworks.com/science-vs-myth/extrasensory-perceptions/tarot-card6.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Tasseography is a divination method, typically utilizing tea leaves or coffee grounds. Western tasseography first started in medieval Europe, where fortune tellers would interpret splatters of wax, lead, and various other molten substances. When the Dutch brought tea from China in the seventeenth century, this evolved into tea tasseography. Tasseography is typically performed in a bright colored cup to contrast with the dark tea leaves or coffee grounds. The bright colors symbolize good fortunes while the dark color symbolizes misfortunes.&lt;ref&gt;Guiley, Rosemary. "tasseomancy." The encyclopedia of witches, witchcraft, and wicca. 3rd ed.

==In climate==
As [[climate change]] and other weather phenomenon become more common, the predictability of climate systems becomes more important. The [[IPCC]] notes that our ability to predict future detailed climate interactions is difficult, however, long term climate forecasts are possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Predictability of the Climate System|url=https://www.ipcc.ch/ipccreports/tar/wg1/265.htm|website=Working Group I: The Scientific Basis|publisher=IPCC|accessdate=26 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Spring Predictability Barrier===
The Spring Predictability Barrier refers to a period of time early in the year when making summer weather predictions about the [[El Niño–Southern Oscillation]] is difficult. It is unknown why it is difficult, although many theories have been proposed. There is some thought that the cause is due to the [[ENSO]] transition where conditions are more rapidly shifting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=L'Heureux|first1=Michelle|title=The Spring Predictability Barrier: we'd rather be on Spring Break|url=https://www.climate.gov/news-features/blogs/enso/spring-predictability-barrier-we’d-rather-be-spring-break|website=Climate.gov|publisher=NOAA|accessdate=26 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In macroeconomics ==
Predictability in macroeconomics refers most frequently to the degree to which an economic model accurately reflects quarterly data and the degree to which one might successfully identify the internal propagation mechanisms of models. Examples of US macroeconomic series of interest include but are not limited to Consumption, Investment, Real GNP, and Capital Stock. Factors that are involved in the predictability of an economic system include the range of the forecast (is the forecast two years "out" or twenty) and the variability of estimates. Mathematical processes for assessing the predictability of macroeconomic trends are still in development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Diebold|first1=Francis X.|title= Measuring Predictability: Theory and Macroeconomic Applications|url=https://www.jstor.org.ezp-prod1.hul.harvard.edu/stable/pdf/2678520.pdf?refreqid=search%3Aedbefab250df2fc366425cd574f0d998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Process duct work''' conveys large volumes of hot, dusty air from [[Process engineering|processing equipment]] to mills, baghouses to other process equipment. Process [[Duct (industrial exhaust)|duct work]] may be round or rectangular. Although round duct work costs more to fabricate than rectangular duct work, it requires fewer stiffeners and is favored in many applications over rectangular ductwork.

The air in process duct work may be at ambient conditions or may operate at up to {{convert|900|°F}}. Process ductwork varies in size from 2&amp;nbsp;ft diameter to 20&amp;nbsp;ft diameter or to perhaps 20&amp;nbsp;ft by 40&amp;nbsp;ft rectangular.

Large process ductwork may fill with dust, depending on slope, to up to 30% of cross section, which can weigh 2 to 4 tons per linear foot.

Round ductwork is subject to duct suction collapse, and requires stiffeners to minimize this, but is more efficient in material than rectangular duct work.

There are no comprehensive, design references for process duct work design. The ASCE reference for the design of power plant duct design gives some general guidance on duct design, but does not specifically give designers sufficient information to design process duct work.

==Structural process ductwork==
Structural process ductwork carries large volumes of high temperature, dusty air, between pieces of process equipment. The design of this ductwork requires an understanding of the interaction of heat softening of [[metal]]s, potential effects of dust buildup in large ductwork, and [[structural design]] principles. There are two basic shapes for structural process ductwork: rectangular and round. Rectangular ductwork is covered by the [[American Society of Civil Engineers|ASCE]] "The Structural Design of Air &amp; Gas Ducts for Process Power Stations and Industrial Applications".

In the practical design of primarily round structural process ductwork in the [[cement]], [[Lime (material)|lime]] and [[lead]] industries, the duct size involved ranges from 18&amp;nbsp;inches (45&amp;nbsp;cm) to 30&amp;nbsp;feet (10&amp;nbsp;m). The air temperature may vary from ambient to 1000&amp;nbsp;°F (515&amp;nbsp;°C). Process ductwork is subject to large loads due to dust buildup, fan suction pressure, wind, and [[earthquake]] forces. {{As of|2009}} 30&amp;nbsp;ft diameter process ductwork may cost $7,000 per ton. Failure to properly integrate design forces may lead to catastrophic duct collapse. Overdesign of ductwork is expensive.

===Round and rectangular duct structural design===
The structural design of ductwork plate is based on buckling of the plate element. Round ductwork plate design is based on diameter to duct plate thickness ratios, and the allowable stresses are contained in multiple references such as ''US Steel Plate'', ASME/ANSI STS-1,SMNACA, ''Tubular Steel Structures'', and other references. In actuality round ductwork bent in bending is approximately 30% stronger than a similar shape in compression, however one uses the same allowable stresses in bending as we do for compression.

Round ducts require typical stiffeners at roughly 3 diameter spacing, or roughly 20&amp;nbsp;ft. O.C. for wind ovaling and fabrication and truck shipping requirements. Round ducts, larger than {{convert|6|ft|6|in}} in diameter (1/4" plate) require support ring stiffeners. Smaller-diameter ducts may not require support ring stiffeners, but may be designed with saddle supports. When stiffener rings are required they are traditionally designed based on "Roark", although this reference is quite conservative.

Round duct elbow allowable stresses are lower than the allowable stresses for straight duct  by a K factor = 1.65/(h 2/3power) where [h = t (duct) * R (elbow) /(r(duct)*r (duct). This equation, or similar equations is found in ''Tubular Steel Structures'' section 9.9.

Rectangular ductwork design properties is based on width-to-thickness ratios. This is simplified, normally to width=t/16, from corner elements or corner angle stiffeners, although in reality, the entire duct top &amp; side plate does participate, somewhat in duct section properties.

===Duct logic===

Duct logic is the process of planning for duct thermal movement, combined with planning to minimize duct dust dropout.

Ducts move with changes in internal temperature. Ducts are assumed to have the same temperature as their internal gasses, which may be up to 900&amp;nbsp;°F. If the internal duct temperature exceeds 1000&amp;nbsp;°F, refractory lining is used to minimize the duct surface temperature. At 1000&amp;nbsp;°F, ducts may grow approximately 5/8 inch per 10 feet of length. This movement must be carefully planned for, with cloth (or metal) expansion joints at each equipment flange, and one joint per each straight section of ductwork.

Sloping ductwork at or above the duct dust angle of repose will minimize dust buildup. Therefore many ducts carrying high dust loads slope at 30 degrees, or steeper.

===Duct elbow geometry===

To minimize pressure loss in duct elbows, the typical elbow radius is 1&amp;nbsp;1/2 times the duct diameter. In cases where this elbow radius is not feasible, turning vanes are added to the duct.

[[File:Stack Inlet Transition.jpg|thumbnail|Stack transition at concrete stack]]
===Duct transition and elbow layout===

Process ductwork is often large (6-foot diameter to 18-foot diameter), carrying large volumes of hot dirty gasses, at velocities of 3000 to 4500 feet per minute. The fans used to move these gasses are also large, 250 to 4000 horsepower. Therefor minimizing duct pressure drop by minimizing turbulence at elbows and transitions is of importance. Duct elbow radius is usually 1&amp;nbsp;1/2 to 2 times the duct size. The side slopes of transitions are typically 10 to 30 degrees.

Note: the duct gas velocity is chosen to minimize duct dust dropout. Cement and lime plant duct velocity at normal operations is 3000 to 3200 foot per minute, lead plant velocities are 4000 to 4500 foot per minute, as the dust is heavier. Other industries, such as grain have lower gas velocities. Higher duct gas velocity may require more powerful fans than lower duct velocities.

===Duct support types===
* Fixed supports typically are designed to resist lateral movement of the duct. Depending on the support geometry, fixed supports may also resist rotation of the duct art the support.
* Sliding supports are typically supported on Teflon, (or other material) pads, isolated from the duct so that temperature and dust does not damage the sliding surface.
* Link supports  are often "bents", or braced frames down from the duct support ring (frame) to a foundation or support plane. if the bent is long enough, hinges are not required to allow for duct thermal growth.
* Rod or hanger supports are similar to link supports, but due to the flexibility of the rod supports, that are easier to design and detail.
* Guide supports: Often rings inside a structural frame, with angle guides, that allow the duct to grow vertically while restraining the duct laterally for wind loads.
* Unusual "support" conditions (details):
** Hinges at expansion joints
** Tension ties across dual fixed supports
** Designs that allowing duct elbows to flex under unusual support conditions
** Other unusual design models.

===Duct design loads===

For cement plant and Lime plant process ductwork, duct loads are a combination of:
# Duct dead loads: are often simplified (in Cement plant usage) by using duct plate weight, multiplied by 1.15 as a stiffener allowance, as duct stiffeners usually weigh less than 15% times the duct plate weight. Duct stiffener allowance for rectangular power plants ductwork may be 50% to 100% of the duct plate weight.
# Duct internal dust loads (bottom of duct): which vary considerably with duct slope. These loads need to be approved by the client, but are often used as follows:
For duct sloping 0 degrees to 30 degrees, duct internal dust is 25% of duct cross section. For duct sloping 30 degrees to  45 degrees duct dust loads are reduced to 15% of cross section, plus internal duct coating loads. For ducts sloping 45 degrees to 85 degrees,duct internal dust is 5% of duct cross section, plus internal duct coating loads. For ducts sloping over 85 degrees.
Because of the potential for high dust loading, most process ductwork is run at a 30 to 45 degree slope.

2a) Duct dust loading in non-process ducts (2-foot diameter and smaller), such as conveyor venting ducts are sometimes run horizontally and can be filled to 100% of cross section.

2b) Power plant internal duct dust loads are coordinated with the client, and are sometimes used at 1 to 2 foot of internal ash loadings.

3) Duct internal, coating dust loads, which sometimes are used as a 2" (50&amp;nbsp;mm) coating of dust on the internal perimeter.

4) Duct suction pressure loads. Most process duct loads have design pressures of 25 inches (600&amp;nbsp;mm) to 40 inches (1000&amp;nbsp;mm) of water pressure. This suction pressure operates to cause suction pressure collapse on the duct side walls. Also this pressure operates perpendicular to the duct "expansion joints" to create an additional load on the duct supports that adds to dead, and live loads. Please note: duct pressure loads vary with temperature, as the gas density varies with temperature. A duct pressure of 25 inches of H2O, at room temperature may become 12 inches to 6 inches at duct operating pressures.

5) Duct wind loads

6) Duct Seismic loads

7) Duct Snow loads, normally inconsequential, as snow will melt quickly unless the plant is in shutdown mode.

8) Top of duct dust loads, often used as zero, since plant dust generation is much less now, than in the past.

9) Duct suction pressure loads, act perpendicular to end of duct cross section, and can be significant. For a duct designed for 25" of water at a startup temperature of 70 degree F, on an 8 foot in diameter duct, this is equal to 8000 pounds at each end of the duct.

[[File:Copy of Duct Fixed Suport.jpg|thumbnail|Duct fixed support]]

==Round ductwork==

The majority of cement plant process ductwork is round. This is because the round duct shape does not bend between circumferential stiffeners. Therefor bending stiffeners are not required, and round ductwork requires fewer and lighter intermediate stiffeners than rectangular ductwork. Round cement plant duct stiffeners are sometimes about 5% duct plate weight. Rectangular cement plant duct stiffeners are 15 to 20% times duct plate weight. Power plant ductwork is often larger. power plant ductwork is usually rectangular, with stiffener weights of 50% (or more) times duct plate weight. (this is based on personal experience, and my vary with loads, duct size, and industry standards)

Large, round process ductwork is usually [[Fabrication (metal)|fabricated]] from 1/4-inch (6&amp;nbsp;mm) mild steel plate, with ovaling stiffening rings at 15 to 20&amp;nbsp;ft (5 to 6 M) on center, regardless of diameter. These lengths allow for resistance to wind ovaling and resistance to out of round when shipping by truck. This also works well with fabricator equipment.

The typical intermediate rings are designed for wind bending [[Stress (mechanics)|stresses]], reduced as required by the [[Yield (engineering)|yield stress]] reduction at working temperatures. The typical rings are fabricated from rolled steel plate, angles or tees's welded together to create the ring cross section required. Rings are fabricated from any combination of plate, tee or W shape that the shop can roll. Rings are usually mild carbon steel, ASTM A36 plate, or equivalent. The location of ring butt welds should preferably be offset 15 degrees(+/-)from point of maximum stress to minimize the effect of weld porosity on weld allowable stress.

See [[U.S. Steel|US Steel]] Plate, volume II for empirical ring spacing, and wind bending stress:
Spacing = Ls = 60 sqrt [Do (ft) * t plate (in) /wind pressure (psf)]
Section = p * L (spacing, ft) * Do (ft) * Do (ft)/Fb (20,000 at ambient T)
This reference is older, but a good starting point for duct design.

SMACNA, (2ND Edition) chapter 4 has many useful formulas for round ducts, allowable stresses, ring spacing, effect of dust, ice,and live loads. The basic factor of safety for SMACNA, 3, is larger than typically used on typical structural engineering projects, of 1.6.
Under SMACNA the critical ring spacing for rings is L = 1.25 * D (ft) sqrt (D(ft)/t(inches)), which is similar to tubular steel structures, L = 3.13 * R sqrt (R/t). In effect, using Spacing = 60 sqrt [Do (ft) * t plate (in) /wind pressure (psf)] is conservative.

Allowable bending and compression stress in ducts can come from several sources.

See API 560 for design of wind ovaling stiffeners

See Tubular Steel structures, chapter 2, 9 &amp; 12 for the allowable stresses for thin, round ducts, their allowable stresses, elbows, elbow softening coefficients, and some procedures for the design of duct support rings. These allowable stresses can be verified with select review of chapters of US Steel Plate, Blodgett Design of plate structures, Roark &amp; Young, or API 650.

Round duct support rings are spaced, often at three diameters, or as require at up to about 50&amp;nbsp;ft centers (14 m). At this spacing the main support rings are designed for the sum of [[suction pressure]] stresses &amp; support bending moments.

Round ductwork allowable compressive stress is = 662 /(d/t) +339 * Fy (tubular steel structures, chapter 2). Other reference use similar equations.

Ductwork typical cement plant pressure drops are: 60% to 80% of high temperature process duct work [[pressure drop]] occurs in the process equipment, baghouses, mills and cyclones. Since motor 1 (one) horsepower cost roughly $1000/year (US$) (2005), duct efficiency is important. Minimizing duct pressure drop can reduce plan operating costs. most ductwork, non-equipment pressure drop occurs at transitions and changes of directions (elbows). The bests way to minimize duct pressure drop or to minimize plant operating costs, is to use elbows with an elbow radius to duct radius exceeding 1.5. (For a 15-foot duct, the elbow radius would therefore equal, or exceed, 22.5&amp;nbsp;ft.)

Process duct pressure drops (US practice) are usually measured in inches of water. A typical duct operates at about - 25 inches (160 psf.) total suction pressure, with roughly 75% of the pressure loss in the bag house, and 10% of pressure lost in duct friction, and 15% (nominal)lost in elbow turbulence. A major consideration of duct design is to minimize duct pressure losses, turbulence, as poor duct geometry, increases turbulence, and increases plant electrical usage.

Round duct work suction pressure collapse, in ducts over 6 feet in diameter, is prevented with rings at supports, and roughly 3 diameter centers.

Round duct support rings are traditionally designed from the formula's found in Roark &amp; Young. However this reference is based on point loads on rings, while actual duct ring loads are based on almost uniform bottom dust. Therefore these formulars can be shown with Ram, or other analysis methods to have conservatism factor of roughly 2 above the stresses given In Roark. The duct ring force dead, live and dust forces need to be combined with suction pressure stresses. Suction pressure forces concentrate on the rings, as they are the stiffest element present.

Round ductwork elbow allowable stresses are reduced due to the elbow curvature. Various references give similar results for this reduction. Tubular steel structures, Section 9.9 gives the (Beskin) reduction factor of K= 1.65/(h (2/3 power)) where h= t (plate) *R(elbow)/ r (duct) (where suction pressures are smaller). This K reduces the I factor of the duct  I effective = I/K.

Round duct rings are fabricated from rolled tees, angles, or plates, welded into the shape required. Typically these are designed with ASTM A-36 properties.

===Factors of safety===

Typical duct round plate factor of safety (traditional factor of safety) should be 1.6, because duct plate bending, and buckling is mostly controlled by typical intermediate ring design.

Typical intermediate ring factor of safety should be 1.6, because there is ample evidence in various codes, (API 360, etc.) that intermediate rings designed for wind ovaling and suction pressure combinations are safe.

Typical main support ring factor of safety, if designed by "Roark" formulas should be 1.6, (If constructed to the Roark normal 1% out of round standard tolerance) because it can be shown by various methods that these formulas are at least a factor of two, above three D duct ring analysis results etc..

Typical duct elbow factor of safety should be above 1.6, because it can be difficult to show that shipping out of round for elbows corresponds to the normal 1% out of round standard tolerance. (various code and reference notes).

==Round structural conveyor tubes==

Round structural tubes are sometimes used to support and contain conveyors transporting coal, lead concentrate, or other dusty material over county roads, plant access roads, or river barge loading facilities. When tubes are used for these purposes they may be 10'-6" to 12 foot diameter, and up to 250 foot long, using up to 1/2" plate and ovaling ring stiffeners at 8 foot (to 20 foot centers). On one such project My firm added L8x8x3/4  at the top 45 degree  location to stiffen the plate near the point of maximum stress for tubes (as per Timoshenko, and others).

Some vendor provide conveyor galleries for the same purpose.

==Rectangular ductwork==

Rectangular cement plant ductwork is often 1/4" (6&amp;nbsp;mm) duct plate, with stiffeners spaced at about 2'-6", depending on suction pressure and temperature. Thinner plate requires a closer stiffener spacing. The stiffeners are usually considered pinned end. Power plant ductwork can be 5/16" thick duct plate, with "fixed end" W stiffeners at roughly 2'-5" spacing. Because rectangular duct plate bends, stiffeners are required at reasonably close spacing. Duct plate 3/16", or thinner, may dishpan, or make noise, and should be avoided.

Rectangular duct section properties are calculated from the distance between the upper to lower duct corners of the ductwork The flanges areas are based on the size of corner angles plus duct plate width based on the plate thickness ratio of 16*t. (see AISC structural duct design below) For section properties the "web" plate is ignored.

The typical stiffener spacing for cement plant duct work is usually based on duct plate bending M = W * L * L / 8. This is because using a fixed-fixed condition requires difficult to design plate attachments. Power plant, and other larger ductwork,  usually goes thru the expense of creating "fixed End" corner moment. all stiffeners for rectangular ductwork requires consideration of lateral torsional bracing stiffeners.

==Effect of temperature on duct yield stress==
Ducts are usually designed as if the duct plate and stiffener temperatures match the internal duct gas temperatures. For mild carbon steels (ASTM A36) temperatures, the design yield stress ratio at 300°F is 84% of room temperature stress. At 500°F, the design yield stress ratio is 77% of room temperature stress. At 700°F, the design yield stress ratio is about 71% of room temperature stress. Temperatures above 800°F may cause mild carbon steel to warp. This is because, in this temperature range, the crystal lattice structure of mild carbon steel changes with temperatures above about 800 degrees F (reference, US Steel Plate, elevated temperature steel).

For ductwork operating above 800 degrees F, duct plate material should resist warping. Either Core-ten or ASTM A304 stainless steel may be used for duct plate between 800°F and 1200°F, Core-ten plate is less expensive than stainless steel.

Corten steels have essentially the same yield stress ratios as Corten through 700°F. At 900°F, the yield stress ratio is 63%. At 1100°F, the yield stress ratio is 58% (AISC tables). Corten steels should not be used above 1100°F.

Unless the duct and its stiffeners are insulated, the stiffeners can be designed in ASTM A36 steels, even at a duct temperature of 1000°F. This is because the stiffener temperature is cooler than the duct gas temperature by several hundred degrees (F). Duct stiffener temperatures are assumed to drop about 100°F per inch of depth (when uninsulated) (no reference available).

==Corrosion and wear resistance==

===Corrosion===
As reducing the loss of heat at plants has changed over the years, ductwork now connects more pieces of equipment than ever before. Care needs to be taken to avoid condensation of moisture in plant ductwork. Once condensation occurs, the condensation may absorb CO2, other components in the gas stream, and become corrosive on low carbon steel. Methods to avoid this problem may include
# Duct insulation
# specialty steels, such as COR-10 steels or A304 SS or A316L SS,
# Duct internal coatings. Duct internal coatings are expensive, and may cost more than the stack plate they protect. Uncoated stacks cement plant stacks, with condensation, have been noted to last less than two years.

Sulfuric acid attack may require stainless steel ducts, fiberglass ducts, etc.

===Wear resistance===
Many plant exhaust gasses contain dusts with high wear potential. Typically wear resistant steels are not useful in resisting duct wear, particularly at higher temperatures. Wear resistant steel ducts are hard to fabricate, and refractory coatings are usually less expensive than wear resistant steel ductwork. Each industry may have different approaches to resist duct wear.

Cement plant clinker dust is more abrasive than sand. In high temperature ducts, or ducts with wear potential, 2 1/2-inch refractory, is often anchored to the duct plate with V anchors at 6" O.C. (+/-) to resist a) temperature, or b) wear at elbows or a combination of these effects. Occasionally ceramic tiles or ceramic mortars are anchored to ductwork to resist temperature and wear.

Grain plant hulls are also very abrasive. Sometimes plastic liners are used to resist wear in grain facilities, where temperatures are lower than in mineral processing facilities.

==Expansion joint types==

Duct segments are typically separated with metal or fabric expansion joints. These joints are designed and detailed for the duct suction pressure, temperatures, and movements between duct segments. Fabric joints are often chosen to separate the duct segments because they usually cost 40% less than metal joints. Also metal joints place an additional loads onto duct segments. Metal joints prefer axial movements, and provide significant lateral loads onto duct segments.  fabric joints cost $100 to $200 per square foot of joint (2010). Metal joints can cost twice this amount.

fabric expansion duct forces are assumed to be 0 #/inch. Metal expansion joint forces for metal joints a 24-inch diameter duct are on the order of 850#/ inch of movement for axial spring rate, and 32,500 #/inch for lateral movement. These coefficients will vary with duct size, joint thickness, and becomes larger for rectangular ducts (based on one recent job).

Fabric expansion joint life is about 5 years under field conditions. Many plants prefer access platforms near the joints for replacing the joint fabric.

==Finite element software==

Currently software is available to model ductwork in 3D. This software needs to be used with care, as the design rules for width to thickness and elbow softening coefficients, etc., may not be input into the design program.

[[File:Duct Y Split &amp; reinforcing.jpg|thumbnail|Duct transition and reinforcing]]

==Drawing presentation and dimensioning==
{{unreferenced|date=September 2018|section}}

It is easy to draw ducts in 3D without correct dimensioning. Drawings should be laid out with:

* Work points, with elevations, and plan dimensioning.
* Elbow radius, duct diameters, or width and thickness dimensions, elbow tangent dimensions (true view and plan and elevation views)
* Column grids, dimensions between supports, showing work points
* Lack of dimensions in 3D generated drawings makes drawings hard to follow.
* supports need to be coordinated with elevations.

==Special duct loading conditions==

Special duct loading conditions may occur outside of dead, live, dust and temperature conditions. Ductwork associated with coal mills, coke grinding facilities, and to some extent grain processing facilities, may be subject to explosive dusts. Ductwork designed for explosive dust is typically designed for 50 psi internal pressure, and will typically have one explosion relief one vent per duct section. the likelihood of a dust explosion on an indirect coal mill system is 100%, over time. This can generate a plum of fire 5&amp;nbsp;ft. to 15&amp;nbsp;ft. in diameter, and 20&amp;nbsp;ft. to 30&amp;nbsp;ft. long. Therefore access to areas surrounding explosion vents shall limit personal access with locked access.

==Duct details==

Ducts are shipped from fabricating facility to job sites on trucks, by rail, or on barges in lengths accommodating the mode of transport, often in 20 foot sections. These sections are connected with flanges, or weld straps. Flanges are provided at expansion joints, or to join low stress duct sections. Flanges may be difficult to design for the duct plate forces. Flange gaskets add flexibility to the flanges that make their ability to carry forces problematic. Therefore, weld straps (short steel straps) are commonly used for higher stress duct plate connections.

==Various duct photos==
A close look at the fixed duct support photo shows several properties or round ring supports. There are stiffeners at roughly 60 degrees on center. This duct ring is fabricated from two rolled WTs, welded at the center. This is a smaller duct, with light loads, so that the bottom flange was slightly modified by support clearance requirements. A small gap is shown for placing the duct PTFE slide bearing, although a fixed support could also be inserted in this gap. In the background of this photo is a duct flange. The duct flange normally has 3/4" bolts at 6" nominal; spacing. Duct flange angle thickness needs to be designed for duct plate tensile stresses, as flanges will bend. 5/16" or 3/8" angle thicknesses are common.    
  
See above photo of round duct elbows, transitions, and stiffeners. The duct elbow radius is from 1 1/2 to 2 times the duct diameter. The round duct has ovaling, and shipping rings at 20 foot nominal spacing, and larger support rings at supports. The Y split has suction stiffeners at the duct intersection. Note the 3000 HP fan inlet transition and stack inlet transition also shown in this photo. 

The adjacent photo also shows several principles of process ductwork. It shows a large baghouse inlet ductwork. The inlet duct is tapered to minimize dust dropout. A shallow taper such at this also reduces pressure losses when changing duct diameters. Note the rectangular duct ring spacing is roughly 2'-6" on center. The round duct is stiffened near each branch duct.

There are several references for process duct work. These references are worked together to review duct design processes. Other references are often used for duct design, but they give similar results. Finite element design of process duct work is possible, but a requirement of design theory and allowable stresses is required to properly interpret the finite element model.

Cement, lime and lead industry accepted dust loads (for structural loading) are:
Process ductwork is intended to convey large volumes of dust. some of this dust will settle to the bottom of the duct during power outages and normal operation.

The percentage of duct cross section filled with dust is often assumed to be as follows:

* Duct slopes level to 30 degrees, 25% of cross section.
* Duct slopes, 30 degrees to 45 degrees, 15% of cross section
* Duct Slopes, 45 degrees to 85 Degrees, 5%
* Above 85 degrees, a 2&amp;nbsp;in (50&amp;nbsp;mm) interior coating of dust.
* These loads are always confirmed with the client, before use, but the above in US common practice

To minimize the buildup of dust, each material has a minimum carrying velocity, lime = about 2800 fpm., cement about 3200 fpm, and lead dust about 4200 fpm.

Dust density depends on industry, Normally these are: cement dust density = 94 pcf, lime industry = 50 pcf, lead oxide dust = 200 pcf.

Duct Wear: High temperature ductwork often carries large volumes of hot abrasive dust. Often the design temperature of the duct, or the abrasiveness of the dust, prevents the use of abrasive resisting steels. In these cases refractory can be anchored inside the duct, or abrasive resisting tiles, with weld nuts, are welded to the inside of the ductwork.
 
Duct Thermal Movement

Duct steels expand with temperature. Each type of steel may have a different coefficient of thermal expansion, typical mild carbon steels expand with the coefficient of 0.0000065 (See AISC).

'''Retaining walls''' are relatively rigid walls used for supporting the soil mass laterally so that the soil can be retained at different levels on the two sides.
Retaining walls are structures designed to restrain soil to a slope that it would not naturally keep to (typically a steep, near-vertical or vertical slope). They are used to bound soils between two different elevations often in areas of terrain possessing undesirable slopes or in areas where the landscape needs to be shaped severely and engineered for more specific purposes like hillside farming or roadway overpasses.

==Definition==
A retaining wall is a structure designed and constructed to resist the lateral pressure of soil, when there is a desired change in ground elevation that exceeds the [[angle of repose]] of the soil.&lt;ref&gt;Ching, F. D., Faia., R., S., &amp; Winkel, P. (2006). ''Building Codes Illustrated: A Guide to Understanding the 2006 International Building Code'' (2 ed.). New York, NY: Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt;

A basement wall is thus one kind of retaining wall.  But the term usually refers to a cantilever retaining wall, which is a freestanding structure without lateral support at its top.&lt;ref&gt;Ambrose, J. (1991). ''Simplified Design of Masonry Structures''. New York: John Wiley and Sons, Inc. pp. 70–75. {{ISBN|0471179884}}.&lt;/ref&gt; These are cantilevered from a footing and rise above the grade on one side to retain a higher level grade on the opposite side. The walls must resist the lateral pressures generated by loose soils or, in some cases, [[hydrostatic pressure|water pressures]].&lt;ref&gt;Crosbie, M. &amp; Watson, D. (Eds.). (2005). ''Time-Saver Standards for Architectural Design.'' New York, NY: McGraw-Hill.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Terminology.jpg|thumb]]

Every retaining wall supports a "wedge" of [[soil]]. The wedge is defined as the soil which extends beyond the failure plane of the soil type present at the wall site, and can be calculated once the [[angle of repose|soil friction]] angle is known. As the setback of the wall increases, the size of the sliding wedge is reduced. This reduction lowers the pressure on the retaining wall.&lt;ref&gt;(2011) Commercial Installation Manual for Allan Block Retaining Walls (p. 13)&lt;/ref&gt;

The most important consideration in proper design and installation of retaining walls is to recognize and counteract the tendency of the retained material to move downslope due to [[gravity]]. This creates [[lateral earth pressure]] behind the wall which depends on the [[angle]] of internal [[friction]] (phi) and the cohesive strength (c) of the retained material, as well as the direction and magnitude of movement the retaining structure undergoes.

Lateral earth pressures are zero at the top of the wall and – in homogenous ground – increase proportionally to a maximum value at the lowest depth. Earth pressures will push the wall forward or overturn it if not properly addressed. Also, any [[groundwater]] behind the wall that is not dissipated by a [[drainage]] system causes [[hydrostatic pressure]] on the wall. The total pressure or thrust may be assumed to act at one-third from the lowest depth for lengthwise stretches of uniform height.&lt;ref name="retaining-wall-tests"&gt;
{{cite book| last = Terzaghi| first = K.| author-link = Karl von Terzaghi| title = Large Retaining Wall Tests| publisher = Engineering News Record Feb. 1, March 8, April 19 | year = 1934}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unless the wall is designed to retain water, It is important to have proper drainage behind the wall in order to limit the pressure to the wall's design value. Drainage materials will reduce or eliminate the hydrostatic pressure and improve the stability of the material behind the wall. [[Drystone]] retaining walls are normally self-draining.

As an example, the [[International Building Code]] requires retaining walls to be designed to ensure stability against overturning, sliding, excessive [[Foundation (engineering)|foundation]] pressure and water uplift; and that they be designed for a [[safety factor]] of 1.5 against lateral sliding and overturning.&lt;ref&gt;2006 International Building Code Section 1806.1.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==

[[File:Retaining Wall Type Function.jpg|840px|thumb|center|Various types of retaining walls]]

===Gravity===

[[File:Gravity Walls.jpg|thumb|Construction types of gravity retaining walls]]

Gravity walls depend on their mass (stone, concrete or other heavy material) to resist pressure from behind and may have a &lt;!-- "batter" is NOT A TYPO --&gt;'batter' setback to improve stability by leaning back toward the retained soil. For short landscaping walls, they are often made from [[Mortar (masonry)|mortar]]less stone or segmental concrete units (masonry units).&lt;ref name="SEG"&gt;{{cite web| title = Segmental Retaining Walls| publisher = [[National Concrete Masonry Association]]| url = http://www.ncma.org/use/srw.html| accessdate = 2008-03-24 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080304073923/http://www.ncma.org/use/srw.html |archivedate = 2008-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dry-stacked gravity walls are somewhat flexible and do not require a rigid footing.

Earlier in the 20th century, taller retaining walls were often gravity walls made from large masses of concrete or stone. Today, taller retaining walls are increasingly built as composite gravity walls such as: geosynthetics such as geocell cellular confinement earth retention  or with precast facing; [[gabion]]s (stacked steel wire baskets filled with rocks); crib walls (cells built up log cabin style from precast concrete or timber and filled with granular material); or soil-nailed walls (soil reinforced in place with steel and concrete rods).&lt;ref name="soil-mechanics"&gt;{{cite book| last = Terzaghi| first = K.| author-link = Karl von Terzaghi| title = Theoretical Soil Mechanics| place = New York| publisher = John Wiley and Sons| year=1943}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cantilevered===

[[File:Counterfort.jpg|thumb|Counterfort/Buttress on Cantilevered Wall]]
Cantilevered retaining walls are made from an internal stem of steel-reinforced, cast-in-place concrete or mortared masonry (often in the shape of an inverted T). These walls cantilever loads (like a [[beam (structure)|beam]]) to a large, structural footing, converting horizontal pressures from behind the wall to vertical pressures on the ground below. Sometimes cantilevered walls are buttressed on the front, or include a [[Buttress|counterfort]] on the back, to improve their strength resisting high loads. Buttresses are short [[wing wall]]s at right angles to the main trend of the wall. These walls require rigid concrete footings below seasonal frost depth.  This type of wall uses much less material than a traditional gravity wall.

===Sheet piling===
{{anchor|Sheet piling}}

[[File:Spundwand.jpg|thumb|Sheet pile wall]]
Sheet pile retaining walls are usually used in soft soil and tight spaces. Sheet pile walls are made out of steel, vinyl or wood planks which are driven into the ground. For a quick estimate the material is usually driven 1/3 above ground, 2/3 below ground, but this may be altered depending on the environment. Taller sheet pile walls will need a tie-back [[Earth anchor|anchor]], or "dead-man" placed in the soil a distance behind the face of the wall, that is tied to the wall, usually by a cable or a rod. [[Earth anchor|Anchors]] are then placed behind the potential failure plane in the soil.

===Bored pile ===

Bored pile retaining walls are built by assembling a sequence of [[bored pile]]s, proceeded by excavating away the excess soil.  
Depending on the project, the bored pile retaining wall may include a series of [[earth anchor]]s, reinforcing beams, soil improvement operations and [[shotcrete]] reinforcement layer.
This construction technique tends to be employed in scenarios where sheet piling is a valid construction solution, but where the vibration or noise levels generated by a [[pile driver]] are not acceptable.

===Anchored===

{{See also|Tieback (geotechnical)}}

[[File:Anchored wall.jpg|thumb|Anchored wall in the mountainous region of [[Rio de Janeiro (state)|Rio de Janeiro state]], Brazil]]
An anchored retaining wall can be constructed in any of the aforementioned styles but also includes additional strength using cables or other stays anchored in the rock or soil behind it. Usually driven into the material with boring, anchors are then expanded at the end of the cable, either by mechanical means or often by injecting [[Shotcrete|pressurized concrete]], which expands to form a bulb in the soil. Technically complex, this method is very useful where high loads are expected, or where the wall itself has to be slender and would otherwise be too weak.

==Alternative retaining techniques==

===Soil nailing===

{{main|Soil nailing}}
Soil nailing is a technique in which soil slopes, [[Earthworks (engineering)|excavations]] or retaining walls are reinforced by the insertion of relatively slender elements – normally steel reinforcing bars. The bars are usually installed into a pre-drilled hole and then [[grout]]ed into place or drilled and grouted simultaneously. They are usually installed untensioned at a slight downward inclination. A rigid or flexible facing (often sprayed concrete) or isolated soil nail heads may be used at the surface.

===Soil-strengthened===
A number of systems exist that do not consist of just the wall, but reduce the earth pressure acting directly on the wall. These are usually used in combination with one of the other wall types, though some may only use it as facing, ''i.e.'', for visual purposes.

====Gabion meshes====
{{Main|Gabion}}
This type of soil strengthening, often also used without an outside wall, consists of [[wire]] [[mesh]] "boxes", which are filled with roughly cut stone or other material. The mesh cages reduce some internal movement and forces, and also reduce erosive forces. 
Gabion walls are free-draining retaining structures and as such are often built in locations where ground water is present. However, management and control of the ground water in and around all retaining walls is important.

===Mechanical stabilization===

{{main|Mechanically stabilized earth}}

Mechanically stabilized earth, also called MSE, is soil constructed with artificial reinforcing via layered horizontal mats ([[geosynthetics]]) fixed at their ends. These mats provide added internal shear resistance beyond that of simple gravity wall structures. Other options include steel straps, also layered. This type of soil strengthening usually needs outer facing walls (S.R.W.'s – Segmental Retaining Walls) to affix the layers to and vice versa.&lt;ref&gt;
[http://geostone.com/CAD/8vs4-16ft_batter.jpg JPG image]. geostone.com&lt;/ref&gt;

The wall face is often of precast concrete units&lt;ref name="SEG"/&gt; that can tolerate some differential movement. The reinforced soil's mass, along with the facing, then acts as an improved gravity wall. The reinforced mass must be built large enough to retain the pressures from the soil behind it. Gravity walls usually must be a minimum of 50 to 60 percent as deep or thick as the height of the wall, and may have to be larger if there is a slope or surcharge on the wall.

[[Cellular confinement systems|Cellular confinement systems (geocells)]] are also used for steep earth stabilization in gravity and reinforced retaining walls with geogrids. Geocell retaining walls are structurally stable under self- weight and externally imposed loads, while the flexibility of the structure offers very high seismic resistance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Leshchinsky, D. |year=2009|url=http://geosyntheticsmagazine.com/2009/08/01/research-and-innovation-seismic-performance-of-various-geocell-earth-retention-systems/|title=Research and Innovation: Seismic Performance of Various Geocell Earth-retention Systems|journal=Geosysnthetics|volume= 27|issue= 4|pages= 46–52}}&lt;/ref&gt; The outer fascia cells of the wall can be planted with vegetation to create a [[green wall]].

[[file:School_of_irish_learning_1913_-_copy.jpg|thumb|School of Irish Learning in 1913]]
The '''School of Irish Learning''' was a center for Irish studies in [[Dublin]] founded in 1903 by [[Kuno Meyer]], who talked of "the necessity of bringing the [Irish revivalist] movement into direct and intimate relations with scholarship, to provide an avenue for every student of Irish to the higher regions of study and research, to crown the whole edifice by a revival of native scholarship, and thus to bring about a second golden age of Irish learning."&lt;ref&gt;''Celtia'', May/June 1903, p. 83)&lt;/ref&gt; The School's Honorary Secretary was [[R. I. Best]], and among the first students were [[Osborn Bergin]] and [[T. F. O'Rahilly]]. The School published books on language and history which remain standard textbooks for undergraduate courses in Irish, and in 1904 it instituted the scholarly journal ''[[Ériu (journal)|Ériu]]'', of which Meyer was the editor.&lt;blockquote&gt;The principal object of the School was to provide a thorough professional grounding in linguistics, philology, and textual studies for students who had an advanced competence in Irish and Celtic languages. Instruction was for the most part organized in the form of intensive Summer Schools which were conducted by distinguished scholars invited from overseas, e.g. by [[Holger Pedersen (linguist)|Holger Pedersen]], [[Henry Sweet]], and [[Rudolf Thurneysen]]. [[John Strachan (Celticist)|John Strachan]] had a more central rôle, almost equal to that of Kuno Meyer himself. Because its activities were organized in this way, and because it had to depend on uncertain sources of funding, the School from the outset had the character of a temporary expedient... Inevitably, the School would become largely redundant once effective undergraduate and postgraduate training in Irish and Celtic languages had been properly established in Irish Universities...&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.celt.dias.ie/publications/cat/k/k3/hist2.html History of the School of Irish Learning]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;The Governors and Trustees applied to have the School incorporated into the [[Royal Irish Academy]]; the terms of incorporation were agreed on in 1925, the Academy undertaking to maintain the School's publications in print, and in 1926 the School ended its existence.

'''[[China]]''' is the top producer of '''sex toys''' in the world, with 70% of the world's [[sex toy]]s being manufactured there.&lt;ref name="China biggest sex toy" /&gt; The sex toy industry in the country is estimated at [[US$]]2 billion, with over 1,000 manufacturers nationwide. 

According to a report by the China Market Research Centre, the revenue from this industry for January to May, 2010, reached US$940 million. The report noted the best selling items are products that enhance [[sexual arousal]], such as stimulus [[condom]]s, which constitute 21.5% of the market.&lt;ref name="China biggest sex toy"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asiaone.com/News/Latest+News/Asia/Story/A1Story20100711-226332.html |title=China is world's biggest sex toy producer |publisher=[[AsiaOne|Asiaone.com]] |date=2010-07-11 |accessdate=2011-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the deputy director of China Sexology Association, China has come a long way in terms of sexual culture since the opening of the first sex shop in [[Beijing]] in 1993.&lt;ref name="China biggest sex toy"/&gt; From a time when adult products, including condoms, were not even allowed to be imported into China, the sex toy industry has rapidly grown to become the world's biggest manufacturers. China is the world leader in labour-intensive manufacturing in general.&lt;ref name="China emerges"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ndtv.com/article/world/china-emerges-as-top-exporter-of-sex-toys-report-36709 |title=China emerges as top exporter of sex toys: Report |publisher=[[NDTV|ndtv.com]] |date=2010-07-10 |accessdate=2011-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the reports in the ''[[People's Daily]]'', the biggest export market is to [[South Africa]] (almost 20%), with South Korea and Russia being the second and third largest importers, and the [[United States|US]] accounting for only 2% of the market.&lt;ref name="Nation becomes"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/90001/90778/90860/7060276.html |title=Nation becomes world's biggest sex-toy producer |newspaper=[[People's Daily]] |date=2010-07-10 |accessdate=2011-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other reports have described much greater export volumes to the US and Europe.&lt;ref name="China biggest sex toy"/&gt; Most of the sex toys exported are manufactured in the factories in [[Guangdong]], in the country's south, and [[Zhejiang]], in eastern China.&lt;ref name="Nation becomes"/&gt;

There are also a number of foreign sex toy manufacturing companies that have invested in China. These companies have invested in either the production, trading or marketing of their products in the Chinese market.

'''''The Lost Books of the Bible and the Forgotten Books of Eden''''' (1926) is a collection of 17th-century and 18th-century English translations of some [[Old Testament Pseudepigrapha]] and [[New Testament Apocrypha]], some of which were assembled in the 1820s, and then republished with the current title in 1926.

==History of the translations==
Rutherford Hayes Platt, in the preface to his 1963 reprint of ''The Lost Books of the Bible and the Forgotten Books of Eden'' states:
:"First issued in 1926, this is the most popular collection of apocryphal and pseudepigraphal literature ever published."
The translations were first published, under this title, by an unknown editor in ''The Lost Books of the Bible'' Cleveland 1926, but the translations had previously been published many times. 

The book is, essentially, a combined reprint of earlier works.  The first half, ''Lost Books of the Bible'', is an unimproved reprint of a book published by [[William Hone]] in 1820, titled ''The Apocryphal New Testament'', itself a reprint of a translation of the [[Apostolic Fathers]] done in 1693 by [[William Wake]], who later became the Archbishop of Canterbury, and a smattering of medieval embellishments on the New Testament, from a book  by [[Jeremiah Jones (tutor)|Jeremiah Jones]] (1693-1724), posthumously published in 1736. In the three centuries since these were originally published, a great deal more is known about the [[Apostolic Fathers]] (including a good deal of the original text that was not available in 1693) and New Testament apocrypha.

The second half of the book, ''The Forgotten Books of Eden'', includes a translation originally published in 1882 of the "First and Second Books of Adam and Eve", translated first from ancient Ethiopic to German by [[Ernest Trumpp]] and then into English by [[Solomon Caesar Malan]], and a number of items of Old Testament pseudepigrapha, such as reprinted in the second volume of [[Robert Charles (scholar)|R.H. Charles]]'s ''Apocrypha and Pseudepigrapha of the Old Testament'' (Oxford, 1913).

More modern translations of these works include [[James H. Charlesworth|J. H. Charlesworth]], ed. ''Old Testament Pseudepigrapha''; [[Wilhelm Schneemelcher|W. Schneemelcher]], ed. ''New Testament Apocrypha''; and [[M. R. James]],  ''The Apocryphal New Testament''.

This '''timeline of cosmological theories''' and discoveries is a [[Chronology|chronological]] record of the development of humanity's understanding of the [[cosmos]] over the last two-plus millennia. Modern [[Cosmology|cosmological]] ideas follow the development of the [[science|scientific discipline]] of [[physical cosmology]].

==Pre-1900==
* ca. '''16th century BCE'''&amp;nbsp;— Mesopotamian cosmology has a [[Flat Earth|flat, circular Earth]] enclosed in a [[cosmic ocean]].&lt;ref&gt;Horowitz (1998), p.xii&lt;/ref&gt;
* ca. '''12th century BCE'''&amp;nbsp;— The ''[[Rigveda]]'' has some cosmological hymns, particularly in the late [[Mandala 10|book 10]], notably the  [[Nasadiya Sukta]] which describes the origin of the [[universe]], originating from the [[monistic]] ''[[Hiranyagarbha]]'' or "Golden Egg".
* '''6th century BCE'''&amp;nbsp;— The [[Babylonian world map]] shows the Earth surrounded by the cosmic ocean, with seven islands arranged around it so as to form a seven-pointed star. Contemporary [[Biblical cosmology]] reflects the same view of a flat, circular Earth swimming on water and overarched by the solid vault of the [[firmament]] to which are fastened the stars.

* '''1992'''&amp;nbsp;— Further [[Cosmic Background Explorer|COBE]] measurements discover the very small [[anisotropy]] of the [[cosmic microwave background]], providing a "baby picture" of the seeds of large-scale structure when the universe was around 1/1100th of its present size and 380,000 years old.

* '''1999'''&amp;nbsp;— Measurements of the [[cosmic microwave background radiation]] with finer resolution than COBE, (most notably by the [[BOOMERanG experiment]] see Mauskopf et al., 1999, Melchiorri et al., 1999, de Bernardis et al. 2000) provide evidence for oscillations (the first acoustic peak) in the [[anisotropy]] angular spectrum, as expected in the standard model of cosmological structure formation. The angular position of this peak indicates that the geometry of the universe is close to flat.

==Since 2000==
* '''2001'''&amp;nbsp;— The [[2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey]] (2dF) by an Australian/British team gave strong evidence that the matter density is near 25% of critical density. Together with the CMB results for a flat universe, this provides independent evidence for a [[cosmological constant]] or similar [[dark energy]]. 
* '''2002'''&amp;nbsp;— The [[Cosmic Background Imager]] (CBI) in [[Chile]] obtained images of the cosmic microwave background radiation with the highest angular resolution of 4 arc minutes. It also obtained the anisotropy spectrum at high-resolution not covered before up to l ~ 3000. It found a slight excess in power at high-resolution (l &gt; 2500) not yet completely explained, the so-called "CBI-excess".
* '''2003'''&amp;nbsp;— NASA's [[Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe]] (WMAP) obtained full-sky detailed pictures of the cosmic microwave background radiation. The images can be interpreted to indicate that the universe is 13.7 billion years old (within one percent error), and are very consistent with the [[Lambda-CDM model]] and the density fluctuations predicted by [[cosmic inflation|inflation]].
* '''2003'''&amp;nbsp;— The [[Sloan Great Wall]] is discovered.
* '''2004'''&amp;nbsp;— The Degree Angular Scale Interferometer (DASI) first obtained the E-mode polarization spectrum of the cosmic microwave background radiation.
* '''2005'''&amp;nbsp;— The [[Sloan Digital Sky Survey]] (SDSS) and [[2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey|2dF]] redshift surveys both detected the [[baryon acoustic oscillation]] feature in the galaxy distribution, a key prediction of cold [[dark matter]] models. 
* '''2006'''&amp;nbsp;— The long-awaited three-year [[WMAP]] results are released, confirming previous analysis, correcting several points, and including [[Cosmic microwave background radiation#Polarization|polarization]] data.
* '''2006–2011'''&amp;nbsp;— Improved measurements from [[WMAP]], new supernova surveys ESSENCE and SNLS, and baryon acoustic oscillations from [[Sloan Digital Sky Survey|SDSS]] and [[Astronomical survey#List of sky surveys|WiggleZ]], continue to be consistent with the standard [[Lambda-CDM model]]. 
* '''2014'''&amp;nbsp;— On March 17, 2014, astrophysicists of the [[BICEP and Keck Array|BICEP2]] collaboration announced the detection of inflationary [[gravitational waves]] in the [[B-modes|B-mode]] [[power spectrum]], which if confirmed, would provide clear experimental evidence for the [[Inflation (cosmology)|theory of inflation]].&lt;ref name="BICEP2-2014"&gt;{{cite web |author=Staff |title=BICEP2 2014 Results Release |url=http://bicepkeck.org |date=March 17, 2014 |work=[[National Science Foundation]] |accessdate=March 18, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NASA-20140317"&gt;{{cite web |last=Clavin |first=Whitney |title=NASA Technology Views Birth of the Universe |url=http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?release=2014-082 |date=March 17, 2014 |work=[[NASA]] |accessdate=March 17, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT-20140317"&gt;{{cite news |last=Overbye |first=Dennis |authorlink=Dennis Overbye |title=Space Ripples Reveal Big Bang’s Smoking Gun |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/18/science/space/detection-of-waves-in-space-buttresses-landmark-theory-of-big-bang.html |date=March 17, 2014 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=March 17, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT-20140324"&gt;{{cite news |last=Overbye |first=Dennis |authorlink=Dennis Overbye |title=Ripples From the Big Bang |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/25/science/space/ripples-from-the-big-bang.html |date=March 24, 2014 |work=[[New York Times]] |accessdate=March 24, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PRL-20140619"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.math.columbia.edu/~woit/wordpress/?p=6865&lt;/ref&gt; However, on June 19, 2014, lowered confidence in confirming the [[cosmic inflation]] findings was reported.&lt;ref name="PRL-20140619"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ade, P.A.R. |author2=BICEP2 Collaboration |title=Detection of B-Mode Polarization at Degree Angular Scales by BICEP2 |url=http://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.112.241101 |date=June 19, 2014 |journal=[[Physical Review Letters]] |volume=112 |page=241101 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.112.241101 |format=[http://journals.aps.org/prl/pdf/10.1103/PhysRevLett.112.241101 PDF]|accessdate=June 20, 2014 |arxiv = 1403.3985 |bibcode = 2014PhRvL.112x1101B |pmid=24996078}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT-20140619"&gt;{{cite news |last=Overbye |first=Dennis |authorlink=Dennis Overbye |title=Astronomers Hedge on Big Bang Detection Claim |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/20/science/space/scientists-debate-gravity-wave-detection-claim.html |date=June 19, 2014 |work=[[New York Times]] |accessdate=June 20, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC-20140619"&gt;{{cite news |last=Amos |first=Jonathan |title=Cosmic inflation: Confidence lowered for Big Bang signal |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-27935479 |date=June 19, 2014 |work=[[BBC News]] |accessdate=June 20, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1556">'''Timing''' in music refers to the ability to "keep time" accurately and to synchronise to an ensemble,&lt;ref&gt;http://dbic.dartmouth.edu/grafton/papers/Janata.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; as well as to [[expressive timing]]&amp;mdash;subtle adjustment of [[Musical note|note]] or [[beat (music)|beat]] duration, or of [[tempo]], for [[aesthetic]] effect.

Research in [[music cognition]] has shown that time as a subjective structuring of events in music differs from the concept of time in physics.&lt;ref&gt;Michon, J.A. &amp; Jackson, J.L. (1985) ''Time, Mind, and Behavior''. Berlin: Springer&lt;/ref&gt; Listeners to music do not perceive rhythm on a continuous scale, but recognise rhythmic categories that function as a reference relative to which the deviations in timing can be appreciated.&lt;ref&gt;Clarke, E. F. (1999) Rhythm and Timing in Music, in: Diana Deutsch (ed.), ''Psychology of Music'', second edition, University of California, San Diego, pp.473-500&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Honing, H.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6749">The '''trinomial tree''' is a [[Lattice model (finance)|lattice based]] [[computational model]] used in [[financial mathematics]] to price [[option (finance)|options]]. It was developed by [[Phelim Boyle]] in 1986. It is an extension of the [[binomial options pricing model]], and is conceptually similar. It can also be shown that the approach is equivalent to the [[Finite_difference_method#Explicit_method|explicit]] [[finite difference methods for option pricing|finite difference method for option pricing]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070622150346/http://www.in-the-money.com/pages/author.htm Mark Rubinstein]&lt;/ref&gt; For [[fixed income]] and [[interest rate derivative]]s see [[Lattice model (finance) #Interest rate derivatives]].

==Formula==
Under the trinomial method, the [[underlying]] stock price is modeled as a recombining tree, where, at each node the price has three possible paths: an up, down and stable or middle path.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sitmo.com/article/binomial-and-trinomial-trees/ Trinomial Tree, geometric Brownian motion] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721155149/http://www.sitmo.com/article/binomial-and-trinomial-trees/ |date=2011-07-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These values are found by multiplying the value at the current node by the appropriate factor &lt;math&gt; u\,&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt; d\,&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt; m\,&lt;/math&gt; where
:&lt;math&gt; u = e^{\sigma\sqrt {2\Delta t}}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; d = e^{-\sigma\sqrt {2\Delta t}} = \frac{1}{u} \,&lt;/math&gt; (the structure is recombining)
:&lt;math&gt; m = 1 \,&lt;/math&gt;

and the corresponding probabilities are: 
:&lt;math&gt; p_u = \left(\frac{e^{(r - q)  \Delta t / 2}- e^{-\sigma\sqrt {\Delta t/2}}}{e^{\sigma\sqrt {\Delta t/2}}- e^{-\sigma\sqrt {\Delta t/2}}}\right)^2 \,&lt;/math&gt; 
:&lt;math&gt; p_d = \left(\frac{e^{\sigma\sqrt {\Delta t/2}}-e^{(r - q)  \Delta t / 2}}{e^{\sigma\sqrt {\Delta t/2}}- e^{-\sigma\sqrt {\Delta t/2}}}\right)^2 \,&lt;/math&gt; 
:&lt;math&gt; p_m = 1 - (p_u + p_d) \,&lt;/math&gt;.

In the above formulae: &lt;math&gt; \Delta t \,&lt;/math&gt; is the length of time per step in the tree and is simply time to maturity divided by the number of time steps; &lt;math&gt; r\,&lt;/math&gt; is the [[risk-free interest rate]] over this maturity; &lt;math&gt; \sigma\,&lt;/math&gt; is the corresponding [[volatility (finance)|volatility of the underlying]]; &lt;math&gt; q\,&lt;/math&gt; is its corresponding [[dividend yield]].&lt;ref name="JHull"&gt;[[John C. Hull|John Hull]] presents alternative formulae; see: {{cite book | last = Hull
| first = John C. | edition = 5th | title = Options, Futures and Other Derivatives | year = 2002 | publisher = [[Prentice Hall]] | isbn = 0-13-009056-5 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

As with the binomial model, these factors and probabilities are specified so as to ensure that the price of the [[underlying]] evolves as a [[Martingale (probability theory)|martingale]], while the [[Moment (mathematics)|moments]] - considering node spacing and probabilities - are matched to those of the [[log normal distribution]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/maths/people/staff/oleg_zaboronski/fm/trinomial_tree_2008.pdf Pricing Options Using Trinomial Trees]&lt;/ref&gt; (and with increasing accuracy for smaller time-steps).  Note that for &lt;math&gt; p_u &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt; p_d &lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt; p_m &lt;/math&gt; to be in the interval &lt;math&gt; (0,1) &lt;/math&gt; the following condition on &lt;math&gt; \Delta t &lt;/math&gt; has to be satisfied &lt;math&gt; \Delta t &lt; 2\frac{\sigma^2}{(r-q)^2} &lt;/math&gt;.

Once the tree of prices has been calculated, the option price is found at each node largely [[Binomial_options_pricing_model#Methodology|as for the binomial model]], by working backwards from the final nodes to today. The difference being that the option value at each non-final node is determined based on the three - as opposed to ''two'' - later nodes and their corresponding probabilities. The model is best understood visually - see, for example [http://www.hoadley.net/options/binomialtree.aspx?tree=T Trinomial Tree Option Calculator] (Peter Hoadley).

If the length of time-steps &lt;math&gt; \Delta t &lt;/math&gt; is taken as an exponentially distributed random variable and interpreted as the waiting time between two movements of the stock price then the resulting stochastic process is a [[birth-death process]]. The resulting [[Korn-Kreer-Lenssen Model|model]] is soluble and there exist analytic pricing and hedging formulae for various options.

==Application==
The trinomial model is considered&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hoadley.net/options/calculators.htm On-Line Options Pricing &amp; Probability Calculators]&lt;/ref&gt; to produce more accurate results than the binomial model when fewer time steps are modelled, and is therefore used when computational speed or resources may be an issue. For [[vanilla option]]s, as the number of steps increases, the results rapidly converge, and the binomial model is then preferred due to its simpler implementation. For [[exotic option]]s the trinomial model (or adaptations) is sometimes more stable and accurate, regardless of step-size.

Women have engaged in [[philosophy]] throughout the field's history. While there were women [[philosopher]]s since ancient times, and a relatively small number were accepted as philosophers during the [[ancient philosophy|ancient]], [[Medieval philosophy|medieval]], [[Modern philosophy|modern]] and [[Contemporary philosophy|contemporary]] eras, particularly during the 20th and 21st century, almost no woman philosophers have entered the philosophical [[Western canon]].&lt;ref name="Duran, Jane 2005"&gt;Duran, Jane. Eight women philosophers: theory, politics, and feminism. University of Illinois Press, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="read.hipporeads.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://read.hipporeads.com/why-i-left-academia-philosophys-homogeneity-needs-rethinking/#|title=Why I Left Academia: Philosophy’s Homogeneity Needs Rethinking - Hippo Reads|author=|date=|website=read.hipporeads.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[ancient philosophy]] in the West, while academic philosophy was typically the domain of male philosophers such as [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]], female philosophers such as [[Hipparchia of Maroneia]] (active ca. 325 BC), [[Arete of Cyrene]] (active 5th–4th century BC) and [[Aspasia of Miletus]] (470–400 BC) were active during this period. Notable [[medieval philosophy|medieval philosophers]] include [[Hypatia]] (5th century), [[St. Hildegard of Bingen]] (1098-1179) and [[St. Catherine of Sienna]] (1347-1380). Notable [[Modern philosophy|modern philosophers]] included [[Mary Wollstonecraft]] (1759-1797) and [[Sarah Margaret Fuller]] (1810-1850). Influential [[Contemporary philosophy|contemporary philosophers]] include [[Susanne Langer]] (1895–1985), [[Hannah Arendt]] (1906–1975), [[Simone de Beauvoir]] (1908–1986), [[Mary Midgley]] (born 1919), [[Mary Warnock]] (born 1924), [[Julia Kristeva]] (born 1941), [[Patricia Churchland]] (born 1943) and [[Susan Haack]] (born 1945).

In the early 1800s, some colleges and universities in the UK and US began [[Mixed-sex education#Higher-education institutions|admitting women]], giving rise to new generations of female academics. Nevertheless, [[U.S. Department of Education]] reports from the 1990s indicate that [[philosophy]] is one of the least proportionate fields in the [[humanities]] with respect to gender.&lt;ref name="Salary, Promotion 1997"&gt;"Salary, Promotion, and Tenure Status of Minority and Women Faculty in U.S. Colleges and Universities."National Center for Education Statistics, Statistical Analysis Report, March 2000; U.S. Department of Education, Office of Education Research and Improvement, Report # NCES 2000–173;1993 National Study of Postsecondary Faculty (NSOPF:93). See also "Characteristics and Attitudes of Instructional Faculty and Staff in the Humanities." National Center For Education Statistics, E.D. Tabs, July 1997. U.S. Department of Education, Office of Education Research and Improvement, Report # NCES 97-973;1993 National Study of Postsecondary Faculty (NSOPF-93).&lt;/ref&gt; Women make up as little as 17% of philosophy faculty in some studies.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;U.S. Department of Education statistics in above-cited reports seem to put the number closer to 17%, but these numbers are based on data from the mid-1990s. [[Margaret Urban Walker]]'s more recent article (2005) discusses the data problem and describes more recent estimates as an "(optimistically projected) 25–30 percent."&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, ''[[Inside Higher Education]]'' described the philosophy "...discipline’s own long history of [[misogyny]] and [[sexual harassment]]" of women students and professors.&lt;ref name="insidehighered.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2014/05/19/unofficial-internet-campaign-outs-professor-alleged-sexual-harassment-attempted|title=Unofficial Internet campaign outs professor for alleged sexual harassment, attempted assault|author=|date=|website=insidehighered.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jennifer Saul]], a professor of philosophy at the [[University of Sheffield]], stated in 2015 that women are "...leaving philosophy after being harassed, assaulted, or retaliated against."&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/2015/jan/05/philosophy-is-for-posh-white-boys-with-trust-funds-why-are-there-so-few-women|title=Philosophy is for posh, white boys with trust funds' – why are there so few women?|first1=Rebecca|last1=Ratcliffe|first2=Claire|last2=Shaw|date=5 January 2015|website=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1990s, the [[Canadian Philosophical Association]] claimed that there is gender imbalance and [[gender bias]] in the academic field of philosophy.&lt;ref name="nas.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nas.org/articles/women_in_philosophy_problems_with_the_discrimination_hypothesis|title=Women in Philosophy: Problems with the Discrimination Hypothesis - National Association of Scholars|author=|date=|website=www.nas.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2013, a US sociology professor stated that "out of all recent citations in four prestigious philosophy journals, female authors comprise just 3.6 percent of the total." The editors of the [[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]] have raised concerns about the underrepresentation of women philosophers, and they require editors and writers to ensure they represent the contributions of women philosophers.&lt;ref name="nas.org"/&gt; According to Eugene Sun Park, "[p]hilosophy is predominantly white and predominantly male. This homogeneity exists in almost all aspects and at all levels of the discipline."&lt;ref name="read.hipporeads.com"/&gt; Susan Price argues that the philosophical "...canon remains dominated by white males—the discipline that...still hews to the myth that genius is tied to gender."&lt;ref name="theatlantic.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2015/05/reviving-the-female-canon/393110/|title=Reviving the Female Canon|first=Susan|last=Price|date=13 May 2015|website=theatlantic.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Saul, "[p]hilosophy, the oldest of the [[humanities]], is also the malest (and the whitest).  While other areas of the humanities are at or near gender parity, philosophy is actually more overwhelmingly male than even mathematics."&lt;ref name="salon.com"/&gt;

==Representation and working climate==
[[File:Martha Nussbaum wikipedia 10-10.jpg|thumb|right|200px|American philosopher [[Martha Nussbaum]], who completed a PhD in philosophy at [[Harvard University]] in 1975, alleges that she encountered a tremendous amount of discrimination at Harvard, including sexual harassment and problems getting childcare.&lt;ref name="berkeley.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://globetrotter.berkeley.edu/people6/Nussbaum/nussbaum-con1.html|title=Conversation with Martha C. Nussbaum, p. 1 of 6|work=berkeley.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; ]]
In the early 1990s, the [[Canadian Philosophical Association]] claimed that "...there is compelling evidence" of "...philosophy’s gender imbalance" and "bias and partiality in many of its theoretical products." In 1992, the association recommended that "fifty percent of [philosophy]...positions should be filled by women.”&lt;ref name="nas.org"/&gt; In a 2008 article “Changing the Ideology and Culture of Philosophy: Not by Reason (Alone),” MIT philosophy professor [[Sally Haslanger]] stated that the top twenty graduate programs in philosophy in the US have from 4 percent to 36 percent women faculty.&lt;ref name="nas.org"/&gt; In June 2013, Duke University professor of sociology Kieran Healy stated that "out of all recent citations in four prestigious philosophy journals, female authors comprise just 3.6 percent of the total." The editors of the [[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]] have raised concerns about the underrepresentation of women philosophers; as such, the encyclopedia “encourage[s] [their] authors, subject editors, and referees to help ensure that SEP entries do not overlook the work of women or indeed of members of underrepresented groups more generally.”&lt;ref name="nas.org"/&gt;

In 2014, philosophy professors Neven Sesardic and Rafael De Clercq published an article entitled "Women in Philosophy: Problems with the Discrimination Hypothesis." The article states that a "...number of philosophers attribute the underrepresentation of women in philosophy largely to [[gender bias|bias against women]] or some kind of wrongful [[discrimination]]". Evidence cited includes "gender disparities that increase along the path from undergraduate student to full-time faculty member"; "anecdotal accounts of discrimination in philosophy"; "research on gender bias in the evaluation of manuscripts, grants, and curricula vitae in other academic disciplines"; "psychological research on implicit bias"; "psychological research on [[stereotype threat]]" and the "...relatively small number of articles written from a feminist perspective in leading philosophy journals".&lt;ref name="nas.org"/&gt; Sesardic and De Clercq argue that "proponents of the discrimination hypothesis, who include distinguished philosophers ...have tended to present evidence selectively."&lt;ref name="nas.org"/&gt;

American philosopher [[Sally Haslanger]] stated in 2008 that "...it is very hard to find a place in philosophy that isn’t actively hostile towards women and minorities, or at least assumes that a successful philosopher should look and act like a (traditional, white) man.”&lt;ref name="theguardian.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jul/25/philosphy-women-warnock-baggini-debate|title=Does philosophy have a problem with women?|first1=Mary|last1=Warnock|first2=Julian|last2=Baggini|date=25 July 2015|website=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Haslanger states that she experienced “occasions when a woman’s status in graduate school was questioned because she was married, or had a child (or had taken time off to have a child so was returning to philosophy as a ‘mature’ student), or was in a long-distance relationship". American philosopher [[Martha Nussbaum]], who completed a PhD in philosophy at [[Harvard University]] in 1975, alleges that she encountered a tremendous amount of discrimination during her studies at Harvard, including sexual harassment and problems getting childcare for her daughter.&lt;ref name="berkeley.edu"/&gt;

In July 2015, British philosopher [[Mary Warnock]] addressed the issue of the representation of women in British university philosophy departments, where 25% of faculty are women. Warnock stated she is "... against intervention, by [[Hiring quota|quota]]s or otherwise, to increase women’s chances of employment" in philosophy.&lt;ref name="theguardian.com"/&gt; She also argues that "... there is nothing intrinsically harmful about this imbalance" and she states that she does not "...believe it shows a conscious bias against women." &lt;ref name="theguardian.com"/&gt; Philosopher [[Julian Baggini]] states that he believes that there is "...little or no conscious discrimination against women in philosophy". At the same time, Baggini states that there may be a "...great deal of unconscious bias" against women in philosophy, because philosophy generally does not address issues of gender or ethnicity.&lt;ref name="theguardian.com"/&gt;

===Allegations of sexual harassment===
In 2014, ''[[Inside Higher Education]]'' described the philosophy "...discipline’s own long history of misogyny and sexual harassment."&lt;ref name="insidehighered.com"/&gt; On March 28, 2011, the blog ''New APPS'' published a post examining the allegations of persistent [[sexual harassment]] faced by women professors in philosophy, due largely to "serial harassers" continuing to work in the field despite widespread knowledge of their actions. The post proposed that, since institutional procedures seemed to have been ineffective at removing or punishing harassers, philosophers should socially shun known offenders.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newappsblog.com/2011/03/what-is-to-be-done-about-sexual-harassment-in-the-philosophy-profession.html What is to be done about sexual harassment in the philosophy profession? – New APPS: Art, Politics, Philosophy, Science].

According to Heidi Lockwood, an associate professor of philosophy at [[Southern Connecticut State University]], there is a "...power “asymmetry” between professors and students – even graduate students"; as well, she noted that "...even when colleges and universities have blanket prohibitions against professor-student sexual relationships, as does Yale,...institution-specific policies leave students vulnerable [to sexual advances from faculty] at conferences."&lt;ref name="insidehighered.com"/&gt;
 
According to an August 2013 article in ''Salon'', a tenured male University of Miami philosopher resigned after allegedly "...sending emails to a [female] student in which he suggested that they have sex three times."&lt;ref name="salon.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/2013/08/15/philosophy_has_a_sexual_harassment_problem/|title=Philosophy has a sexual harassment problem|author=|date=15 August 2013|website=salon.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jennifer Saul]], a professor of philosophy at the [[University of Sheffield]], set up a blog for women philosophers in 2010. She received numerous allegations of [[sexual harassment]] by male philosophy faculty, including a "job candidate who said she was sexually assaulted at the annual APA meeting where job interviews take place", an "undergraduate whose professor joked publicly about dripping hot wax on her nipples" and a "... lesbian who found herself suddenly invited, after she came out, to join in the sexualizing of her female colleagues." Saul states that philosophy departments failed to deal with the allegations.&lt;ref name="salon.com"/&gt; In 2013, the [[American Philosophical Association]] formed a committee to study the allegations of sexual harassment of women students and professors by male philosophy faculty.&lt;ref name="insidehighered.com"/&gt; Saul states that one of the allegations was regarding a "...distinguished visiting speaker whose first words are: “Show me a grad student I can fuck”." &lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; Saul states that women are "...leaving philosophy after being harassed, assaulted, or retaliated against." &lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; In 2014, ''Inside Higher Education'' reported allegations that a [[Yale University]] philosophy professor had sexually harassed a woman; the "alleged victim says she reported the professor to Yale, with no real result".&lt;ref name="insidehighered.com"/&gt;
In an interview with ''Inside Higher Ed'', the alleged victim stated that she "...suffers from [[post-traumatic stress disorder]] that impedes everyday life, not only from the alleged attack but also from the “browbeating” she endured as she attempted to report the professor, again and again, to Yale officials."&lt;ref name="insidehighered.com"/&gt;

In 1993, the [[American Philosophical Association]]'s sexual harassment committee set out guidelines for addressing this issue in philosophy departments. The APA guidelines, which were revised in 2013, stated that:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apaonline.org/?harassment|title=Statement on Sexual Harassment - The American Philosophical Association|author=|date=|website=www.apaonline.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*"Sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, or sexually directed remarks constitute sexual harassment when submission to such conduct is made a condition of academic or employment decisions, or when such conduct persists despite its rejection."
*"Sexual harassment is a serious violation of professional ethics, and should be regarded and treated as such by members of the profession. Sexual harassment is a form of prohibited discrimination when an institution or individual employee is aware of a sexually hostile environment and condones, tolerates or allows that environment to exist. Colleges and universities should supply clear, fair institutional procedures under which charges of sexual harassment on campus can be brought, assessed, and acted on."
*"Complaints of sexual harassment at APA-sponsored activities should be brought to the chair of the committee for the defense of professional rights of philosophers or, if they arise in the context of placement activities, to the APA ombudsperson. Complaints of sexual harassment by or against APA staff members should be brought to the chair of the board."

===Black women===
[[File:Angela Davis en Bogotá, Septiembre de 2010.jpg|thumb|right|160px|[[Angela Davis]] (born 1944) is an American [[Activism|political activist]], philosopher and author. Her research interests include [[African-American studies]] and the philosophy of punishment and prisons.]]
There are few black women philosophers, which includes women of African and Caribbean ancestry, [[African-American]]s and other individuals from the [[African diaspora]]. According to philosopher [[Sally Haslanger]], the "numbers of philosophers of color, especially women of color, is even more appalling"; in a 2003 study, there "...was insufficient data for any racial group of women other than white women to report." &lt;ref name="opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/09/02/women-in-philosophy-do-the-math/?_r=0|title=Women in Philosophy? Do the Math|first=Sally|last=Haslanger|date=|website=nytimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, the "...representation of scholars of color is plausibly worse than in any other field in the academy, including not only physics, but also engineering."&lt;ref name="opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com"/&gt;  According to professor L.K. McPherson, there is a "gross underrepresentation of blacks in philosophy."&lt;ref name="newappsblog.com"&gt;L.K. McPherson. On Black Underrepresentation and Progress in the Profession. December 12, 2011. http://www.newappsblog.com/2011/12/new-apps-on-black-underrepresentation-and-progress-in-the-profession.html&lt;/ref&gt;  McPherson states that there is a "...willful, not necessarily a conscious, preference among many members of the philosophy profession largely to maintain the status quo in terms of: the social group profiles of members; the dynamics of prestige and influence; and the areas and questions deemed properly or deeply 'philosophical.' None of this is good for black folk."&lt;ref name="newappsblog.com"/&gt;

The first black woman in the US to do a PhD in philosophy was [[Joyce Mitchell Cook]], who obtained her degree in 1965 from [[Yale University]]. LaVerne Shelton was also one of the earliest black women to receive a PhD in philosophy. Other notable women include [[Angela Davis]], a political activist who specializes in writing about [[feminism]], [[critical theory]], [[Marxism]], [[popular music]], [[social consciousness]], and the philosophy of punishment and prisons; [[Kathryn Gines]], the founding director of the Collegium of Black Woman Philosophers, who specializes in [[continental philosophy]], [[Africana philosophy]], [[Race theory|philosophy of race]] and Black [[feminist philosophy]]; [[Anita L. Allen]], the first African-American woman to complete both a JD and a PhD in philosophy, who focuses on political and legal philosophy, and who in 2010 was appointed by [[President Obama]] to sit on the Presidential Commission for the Study of Bioethical Issues; and [[Adrian Piper]], an analytical philosopher who received a PhD in philosophy from Harvard; Jaqueline Scott, who received a PhD in philosophy from [[Stanford University]], and who specializes in [[Nietzsche]], nineteenth-century philosophy, race theory and [[African-American philosophy]].

=== Asian women ===
Few Asian women are recognized in contemporary Western philosophy. In a [[The New York Times|New York Times]] interview&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/04/06/asian-american-woman-philosopher/|title=Asian, American, Woman, Philosopher|last=Yancy|first=George|last2=Lee|first2=Emily S.|date=2015-04-06|website=Opinionator|language=en-US|access-date=2018-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; with [[George Yancy]], Korean-American philosopher Emily S. Lee, assistant professor of philosophy at [[California State University, Fullerton]], states, "I wonder if some of my experiences occur from being Asian-American, in the ways people stereotypically assume that I must specialize in certain areas of philosophy or behave in specific ways, such as being quiet and subdued." She postulates that the social forces that stereotype and encourage Asian-Americans to enter more lucrative and secure fields (such as engineering or medicine) combined with influences within the field of philosophy discouraging Asian-American youths from continuing their study in the field has led to the extremely small population of Asian-American female philosophers. [[University of Washington]] philosophy professor Carole Lee's report in the [[American Philosophical Association]]'s newsletter on Asian and Asian-American Philosophers and Philosophies suggests&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://c.ymcdn.com/sites/www.apaonline.org/resource/collection/2EAF6689-4B0D-4CCB-9DC6-FB926D8FF530/AsianV14n1.pdf|title=Asian Americans, Positive Stereotyping, and Philosophy|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; that Asian women face conflicting stereotypes, making it difficult for them to fit into the field of philosophy: "Women are stereotyped as submissive rather than aggressive and as being bad at math: they lack both characteristics associated with philosophy." On the other had, "Asian Americans are stereotyped as being mathematical; however, they are characterized in ''passive'' rather than aggressive terms." Philosopher David Kim offers the explanation that a lack of Asian American mentors in philosophy and "derogation of philosophical thought that resonates with their identity" may also contribute to the wide disparity.

==Reports from the US ==
[[U.S. Department of Education]] reports indicate that [[philosophy]] is one of the least proportionate fields in the [[humanities]] with respect to gender.&lt;ref name="Salary, Promotion 1997"/&gt; Although reports indicate that philosophy as a professional field is disproportionately male, no clear, unequivocal data exists on the number of women currently in philosophy, or indeed, on the number of men in philosophy, and it is debatable how to define what it means to be ‘in philosophy.’ This can variously be defined as the current number of Ph.D. holders in philosophy, the current number of women teaching philosophy in two- and four- year institutions of higher learning either/both full-time and/or part-time (no one [[data set]] exists which measures these), or the current number of living women with publications in philosophy. The lack of clear data makes it difficult to establish gender proportions, but the consensus among those who have tried to arrive at an estimate is that women make up between 17% and 30% of academically employed philosophers.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

The [[National Center for Education Statistics]]' 2000 report, "Salary, Promotion, and Tenure Status of Minority and Women Faculty in U.S. Colleges and Universities," estimates in Table 23 that the total number of "History and Philosophy" U.S. citizens and full-time faculty who primarily taught in 1992 was 19,000, of which 79% were men (i.e. 15,010 men in history and philosophy), 21% were women (3,990). They add, "In fact, men were at least twice as likely as women to teach history and philosophy."&lt;ref&gt;NCES (2000), previously cited.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Anita L Allen.JPG|thumb|left|180px|[[Anita L. Allen]] (born 1953) is a professor of law and professor of philosophy at the [[University of Pennsylvania Law School]].]]
In their 1997 report, "[http://nces.ed.gov/pubs97/97973.pdf Characteristics and Attitudes of Instructional Faculty and Staff in the Humanities]," NCES notes, that about "one-half of full-time instructional faculty and staff in 4-year institutions in English and literature (47 percent) and foreign languages (50 percent) were female in the fall of 1992, compared with less than one-half of instructional faculty and staff in history (24 percent) and philosophy and religion (13 percent) (table 4)." In this report they measure Philosophy and Religion in the same data set, and estimate the total number of full-time instructional Philosophy and Religion faculty and staff in 4-yr institutions to be 7,646. Of these, 87.3% are male (6675 men),
12.7 are female (971 women).&lt;ref&gt;NCES (1997), previously cited.&lt;/ref&gt; The 1997 report measures History Full-time instructional faculty and staff in 4-yr institutions to be 11,383; male:76.3 (8,686 men);
female: 23.7 (2,697 women). The numbers of women in philosophy from the two studies are not easily comparable, but one rough method may be to subtract the number of women in history in the 1997 report from the number of women estimated to be in 'history and philosophy' in the 2000 report. Doing so suggests that as a rough estimate, 1,293 women are employed as instructors of philosophy.

The 1997 report indicates that a large portion of all humanities instructors are part-time.&lt;ref&gt;NCES (1997): "Forty-two percent of all instructional faculty and staff were employed part time by their institution in the fall of 1992. Forty-five percent of [all U.S.] humanities faculty were employed part time."&lt;/ref&gt; Part-time employees are disproportionately female but not majority female.&lt;ref&gt;NCES (1997): "Part-time faculty members were more likely to be female (45 percent) than full-time faculty (33 percent), although the majority of both part- and full-time faculty were male (55 percent and 67 percent, respectively)."&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, considerations of full-time employees only necessarily leave out data on many women working part-time to remain active in their field. In 2004, the percentage of Ph.D.s in philosophy, within the U.S., going to women reached a record high percentage: 33.3%, or 121 of the 363 doctorates awarded.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.norc.uchicago.edu/issues/sed-2004.pdf Hoffer, T.B., V. Welch, Jr., K. Williams, M. Hess, K. Webber, B. Lisek, D. Loew, and I. Guzman-Barron. 2005. Doctorate Recipients from United States Universities: Summary Report 2004.

Minorities and Philosophy&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mapforthegap.com/|title=Home|website=Minorities and Philosophy|language=en|access-date=2018-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; (MAP) is an international movement of graduate and undergraduate students and faculty members in philosophy working on issues related to “the underrepresentation of women an minorities in philosophy.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.marcsandersfoundation.org/programs/minorities-and-philosophy/|title=Minorities and Philosophy {{!}} Marc Sanders Foundation|work=Marc Sanders Foundation|access-date=2018-05-01|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; MAP consists of chapters at universities around the world, and the format can vary from school to school. However, all chapters focus broadly on issues minorities face in the profession, philosophical issues regarding minorities, and work done by minority philosophers, as well as issues that are specific to that school’s philosophy department. MAP’s short-term goals include providing a space for students to discuss and work on these issues, and long-term goals include contributing to the culture of academic philosophy and increasing participation and recognition of minorities in philosophy. In recent years, MAP has fostered collaborative work between chapters, establishing "connections between chapters that benefit both members and departments long-term,"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mapforthegap.com/uploads/2/2/3/2/22328318/eoy_report_.pdf|title=Minorities and Philosophy End of Year Report|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; increased work on inclusive pedagogy, and organized efforts to bring philosophy into communities outside of university campuses, such as prisons and elementary schools.

===APA committee on the status of women in philosophy===

The Committee on the Status of Women is a committee of the [[American Philosophical Association]] devoted to the assessment and reporting on the status of women in philosophy.&lt;ref name="apaonlinecsw.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apaonlinecsw.org/mission|title=Mission - APA Committee on the Status of Women|author=|date=|website=www.apaonlinecsw.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is currently chaired by [[Hilde Lindemann]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apaonlinecsw.org/members|title=Committee Members - APA Committee on the Status of Women|author=|date=|website=www.apaonlinecsw.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2007, the Committee on the Status of Women co-sponsored a session on the central question "Why Are Women Only 21% of Philosophy".&lt;ref name="lemmingsblog.blogspot.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lemmingsblog.blogspot.com/2007/04/apa-report-status-of-women-in.html|title=APA Report: the Status of Women in Philosophy|author=|date=|website=lemmingsblog.blogspot.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; At this session, Sharon Crasnow suggested that the low numbers of women in philosophy may be due to:
* Differential treatment: male and female university students may be treated differently in the  classroom.
* Vicious circle: female students do not feel inclined to study philosophy because of a lack of contact with female philosophy professors. 
* Misleading statistics: university administrators focus on gender representation in the humanities overall, which obscures the disparity in philosophy.&lt;ref name="lemmingsblog.blogspot.com"/&gt;

===Society for Women in Philosophy===
The [[Society for Women in Philosophy]] is a group created in 1972 that seeks to support and promote women in philosophy. It has a number of branches around the world, including in New York, the American Pacific, the United Kingdom and Canada.&lt;ref&gt;SWIP Website http://www.uh.edu/~cfreelan/SWIP/hist.html&lt;/ref&gt; Each year, the society names one philosopher the distinguished woman philosopher of the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://leiterreports.typepad.com/blog/2013/03/call-for-nominations-distinguished-woman-philosopher-2013-kukla.html|title=Call for Nominations: Distinguished Woman Philosopher 2013 (Kukla)|author=|date=|website=Leiter Reports:  A Philosophy Blog}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gendered conference campaign===
The blog [[Jennifer Saul#Distinguished Woman Philosopher Award|Feminist Philosophers]] hosts the Gendered Conference Campaign, which works toward increasing the representation of women at philosophy conferences and in edited volumes. The blog states that "all-male events and volumes help to perpetuate the stereotyping of philosophy as male. This in turn to contributes to implicit bias against women in philosophy...."&lt;ref&gt;[http://feministphilosophers.wordpress.com/gendered-conference-campaign/ Gendered Conference Campaign " Feminist Philosophers].

==History==
While there were women philosophers since the earliest times, and some were accepted as philosophers during their lives, almost no woman philosophers have entered the philosophical [[Western canon]].&lt;ref name="Duran, Jane 2005"/&gt;  Historians of philosophy are faced with two main problems. The first being the exclusion of women philosophers from history and philosophy texts, which leads to a lack of knowledge about women philosophers among philosophy students. The second problem deals with what the canonical philosophers had to say about philosophy and women's place in it. In the past twenty-five years there has been an exponential increase in feminist writing about the history of philosophy and what has been considered the philosophical canon.&lt;ref&gt;Witt, Charlotte and Shapiro, Lisa, "Feminist History of Philosophy", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Spring 2015 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL = &lt;http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2015/entries/feminism-femhist/&gt;.
  http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/feminism-femhist/&lt;/ref&gt; According to Eugene Sun Park, "[p]hilosophy is predominantly white and predominantly male. This homogeneity exists in almost all aspects and at all levels of the discipline." &lt;ref name="read.hipporeads.com"/&gt; According to [[Jennifer Saul]], a professor of philosophy at the University of Sheffield, "[p]hilosophy, the oldest of the humanities, is also the malest (and the whitest).  While other areas of the humanities are at or near gender parity, philosophy is actually more overwhelmingly male than even mathematics."&lt;ref name="salon.com"/&gt;
[[File:Emilie_Chatelet_portrait_by_Latour.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Émilie du Châtelet]] (1706-1749)]]
In the May 13, 2015 issue of ''The Atlantic'', Susan Price notes that even though Kant's first work in 1747 cites [[Emilie du Chatelet|Émilie Du Châtelet]], a philosopher who was a "...scholar of Newton, religion, science, and mathematics", "her work won’t be found in the 1,000-plus pages of the new edition of The Norton Introduction to Philosophy." &lt;ref name="theatlantic.com"/&gt; The Norton Introduction does not name a female philosopher until the book begins to cover the mid-20th century. Scholars argue that women philosophers are also absent from the "...other leading anthologies used in university classrooms." &lt;ref name="theatlantic.com"/&gt; Price states that university philosophy anthologies do not usually mention 17th century women philosophers such as [[Margaret Cavendish]], [[Anne Conway (philosopher)|Anne Conway]], and [[Lady Damaris Masham]].&lt;ref name="theatlantic.com"/&gt; Price argues that the philosophical "...canon remains dominated by white males—the discipline that some say still hews to the myth that genius is tied to gender."&lt;ref name="theatlantic.com"/&gt; Amy Ferrer, executive director of the American Philosophical Association, states that “...women have been systematically left out of the canon, and that women coming in have not been able to see how much influence women have had in the field."&lt;ref name="theatlantic.com"/&gt; ''The Encyclopedia of Philosophy'', which as published in 1967, had "...articles on over 900 philosophers, [but it] did not include an entry for [[Mary Wollstonecraft|Wollstonecraft]], [[Hannah Arendt|Arendt]] or [[Simone de Beauvoir|de Beauvoir]]. "[T]hese women philosophers were scarcely even marginal" to the canon set out at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2017/entries/feminism-femhist/|title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|first1=Charlotte|last1=Witt|first2=Lisa|last2=Shapiro|editor-first=Edward N.|editor-last=Zalta|date=11 July 2018|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|via=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Explaining the very small number of women philosophers, American academic and social critic [[Camille Paglia]] (born 1947) argues that "...women in general are less comfortable than men in inhabiting a highly austere, cold, analytical space, such as the one which philosophy involves. Women as a whole ...are more drawn to practical, personal matters. It is not that they inherently lack a talent or aptitude for philosophy or higher mathematics, but rather that they are more unwilling than men to devote their lives to a frigid space from which the natural and the human have been eliminated."&lt;ref name="independent.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/this-britain/ten-great-female-philosophers-the-thinking-womans-women-299061.html|title=Ten great female philosophers: The thinking woman's women|author=|date=|website=independent.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paglia claims that "[t]oday's lack of major female philosophers is not due to lack of talent but to the collapse of philosophy", because, in her view, philosophy "... as traditionally practised may be a dead genre" that "belongs to a vanished age of much slower and rhetorically formal inquiry."&lt;ref name="independent.co.uk"/&gt;

===Ancient philosophy===

[[File:Hipparchia of Maroneia Villa Farnesina.jpg|thumb|right|200px| [[Hipparchia of Maroneia]]. Detail from a Roman wall painting in the [[Villa Farnesina]] in [[Rome]].]]
Some of the earliest philosophers were women, such as [[Hipparchia of Maroneia]] (active ca. 325 BC), [[Arete of Cyrene]] (active 5th–4th century BC) and [[Aspasia of Miletus]] (470–400 BC). Aspasia appears in the philosophical writings of [[Plato]], [[Xenophon]], Aeschines Socraticus and [[Antisthenes]]. Some scholars argue that Plato was impressed by her intelligence and wit and based his character [[Diotima of Mantinea|Diotima]] in the ''[[Symposium (Plato)|Symposium]]'' on her.&lt;ref name="Wider1986"&gt;K. Wider, "Women philosophers in the Ancient Greek World", 21–62&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sykoutris"&gt;I. Sykoutris, ''Symposium (Introduction and Comments)'', 152–153&lt;/ref&gt; [[Socrates]] attributes to the (possibly fictional) [[Diotima of Mantinea]] his lessons in the art of Eros (or philosophical searching). [[Plato]]'s final views on women are highly contested, but the ''Republic'' suggests that women are equally capable of education, intellectual vision, and rule of the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Garside|first1=Christine|title=Plato on Women|journal=Feminist Studies|date=1975|pages=131–138|jstor=3177773|volume=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='Jacobs, William "Platon on Female Emancipation and the Traditional Family"'&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jacobs|first1=William|title=Plato on Female Emancipation and the Traditional Family|journal=Apeiron|date=June 1978|volume=12|issue=1|pages=29–31|doi=10.1515/apeiron.1978.12.1.29|jstor=40913404}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other notable philosophers include:
*[[Theano of Croton]] (6th century BC)
*[[Aristoclea of Delphi]] (6th century BC)
*[[Sosipatra of Ephesus]] (4th century BC)
*[[Nicarete of Megara]] (flourished around 300 BC)
*[[Catherine of Alexandria]] (282-305)
*[[Ptolemais of Cyrene]] (3rd century BC)
*[[Aesara of Lucania]] (3rd century BC)
*[[Diotima of Mantinea]] (appears in [[Symposium (Plato)|Plato's ''Symposium'']])
*[[Ban Zhao]] (c. 35–100){{ref|D2|D2}}
*[[Xie Daoyun]] (before 340 - after 399)
*[[Gargi Vachaknavi]] (7th century BC)

===Medieval philosophy===
[[File:Mort de la philosophe Hypatie.jpg|thumb|right|210px|"Death of the philosopher [[Hypatia]], in Alexandria" (she was killed by an angry mob) - artwork by [[Louis Figuier]] (1866).]] 
[[Medieval philosophy]] dates from the fall of the Western Roman Empire in the 5th century AD to the Renaissance in the 16th century. [[Hypatia]] (AD 350 – 370 to 415) was a [[Greeks|Greek]] [[mathematician]], astronomer, and philosopher in [[Roman Egypt|Egypt]], then a part of the [[Eastern Roman Empire]].&lt;ref name="socrates"&gt;{{Cite book|title= Ecclesiastical History|last= Scholasticus|first= Socrates |authorlink= Socrates Scholasticus |year= |publisher= |location= |isbn= |url = http://cosmopolis.com/alexandria/hypatia-bio-socrates.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was the head of the [[Neoplatonic]] school at [[Alexandria]], where she taught [[philosophy]] and [[astronomy]].&lt;ref&gt;Krebs, ''Groundbreaking Scientific Experiments, Inventions, and Discoveries''; ''The Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy, 2nd edition, Cambridge University Press, 1999: ''"Greek Neoplatonist philosopher who lived and taught in Alexandria."''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title= Women of Mathematics: A Biobibliographic Sourcebook |last1=Mueller |first1=I. |authorlink= |author2=L.S.

*[[Catherine of Siena]] (1347-1380)
*[[Tullia d'Aragona]] (c. 1510-1556)
*[[Moderata Fonte]] (1555–1592), critic of religion, feminist

===Modern philosophy===
The 17th century marks the beginning of the [[modern philosophy]] era, which ended in the early 20th century. During the 17th century, various women philosophers argued for the importance of education for women and two women philosophers influenced [[René Descartes]] and during the early part of the 18th century, two women philosophers commented on [[John Locke]]’s philosophy. [[Laura Bassi]] (1711–1778) was the first woman to earn a university chair in a scientific field. [[Olympe de Gouges]] (1748–1793) demanded that French women be given the same rights as men, a position also taken by [[Judith Sargent Murray]] (1751–1820) in her essay "[[On the Equality of the Sexes]]" and [[Mary Wollstonecraft]] in her essay ''[[A Vindication of the Rights of Woman]]'' (1792). During the 19th century, [[Harriet Martineau]] (1802–1876)  criticized the state of women's education and [[Harriet Taylor Mill]] (1807–1858), [[Sarah Margaret Fuller]] (1810-1850) and [[Antoinette Brown Blackwell]] (1825–1921) called for [[women's rights]]. [[Charlotte Perkins Gilman]] (1860–1935) argued that women were oppressed by an [[androcentrism|androcentric]] culture. Near the start of the 20th century, [[Mary Whiton Calkins]] (1863–1930) was the first woman to become president of the [[American Philosophical Association]]. Women thinkers such as [[Emma Goldman]] (1869–1940), an [[anarchism|anarchist]], and
[[Rosa Luxemburg]] (1871–1919), a [[Marxist theory|Marxist theorist]], are known for their political views.

====17th century====
*[[Marie de Gournay]] (1565–1645) was a critic of religion, proto-feminist, translator and novelist who insisted that women should be educated.
*[[Anna Maria van Schurman]] (1607–1678) was a multilinguist known for her defense of [[female education]]. 
*[[Elisabeth of the Palatinate|Elisabeth of Bohemia]] (1618–1680) influenced many key figures and philosophers, most notably [[René Descartes]], who she corresponded with. She questioned Descartes' idea of [[Mind-body dualism|dualism]], or the mind being separate from the body, and his theories regarding communication between the mind and body. 
*[[Margaret Cavendish, Duchess of Newcastle-upon-Tyne|Margaret Cavendish]] (1623–1673) was a philosopher and writer who addressed gender, power, manners, scientific methods, and philosophy.
*[[Anne Conway (philosopher)|Anne Conway]] (1631-1679) was an [[English people|English]] [[philosopher]] whose work, in the tradition of the [[Cambridge Platonists]], was an influence on [[Gottfried Leibniz|Leibniz]]. Conway's thought is original as it is [[rationalist philosophy]], with hallmarks of gynocentric concerns and patterns, and in that sense it was unique among seventeenth-century systems.&lt;ref name="Duran2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jane Duran|title=Eight Women Philosophers: Theory, Politics, And Feminism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aIzVEF6J6SYC&amp;pg=PA73|accessdate=13 January 2013|year=2006|publisher=University of Illinois Press|isbn=978-0-252-03022-2|pages=73–}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Damaris Cudworth Masham]] (1659–1708) was an English philosopher, [[proto-feminist]], and advocate for women's education. 
*[[Mary Astell]] (1666–1731) was an English [[feminism|feminist]] writer and [[rhetorician]] known for advocacy of equal [[educational opportunities for women]], which earned her the title of "first English feminist."&lt;ref name="litencyc"&gt;Batchelor, Jennie. "[http://www.litencyc.com/php/speople.php?rec=true&amp;UID=168 Mary Astell]". ''The Literary Encyclopedia''. 21 March 2002. Accessed 6 July 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Her most well known books outline her plan to establish a new type of educational institution for women.

====18th century====

[[File:FullerDaguerreotype.jpg|thumb|right|180px|The only known [[daguerreotype]] of [[Margaret Fuller]] (by [[John Plumbe]], 1846).]]
*[[Catharine Trotter Cockburn]] (1679–1749) published her first major philosophical work, ''A Defence of Mr. Lock[e]'s [[An Essay Concerning Human Understanding]]'' in 1702, at the age of 23. Much of the scholarly interest in her writing centres on [[gender studies]]. 
*[[Émilie du Châtelet]] (1706–1749) was a [[France|French]] mathematician, [[physicist]], and author during the [[Age of Enlightenment]]. She translated and commented on [[Isaac Newton]]'s work ''[[Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica]]''. She criticized [[John Locke]]’s philosophy and emphasizes the necessity of the verification of knowledge through experience. She also theorized about [[free will]] and on the way to do [[metaphysics]].&lt;ref&gt;Hagengruber (2011: 8-12,24,53,54)&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Laura Bassi]] (1711–1778) was an Italian philosopher and physicist who was the first woman in the world to earn a university chair in a scientific field of studies. She received a doctoral degree from the [[University of Bologna]] in May 1732,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Laura Bassi| work = MacTutor Biography| publisher = University of St Andrews| url = http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Biographies/Bassi.html| accessdate = 30 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; the third academic qualification ever bestowed on a woman by a university,&lt;ref name="Findlen, Paula"&gt;Findlen, Paula.

*[[Catharine Macaulay]] (1731–1791) was an English historian and writer. She attacked [[Edmund Burke]]'s ''[[Thoughts on the Cause of the Present Discontents]]'', calling it "a poison...".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hill|1992|p=74}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In her 1790 ''Letters on Education'', she argued along the lines that [[Mary Wollstonecraft]] would do in 1792, that the apparent weakness of women was due to their mis-education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Walters, Margaret|year=2006|title=Feminism: A Very Short Introduction|location=USA|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0-19-280510-X|page=30}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Olympe de Gouges]] (1748–1793) was a French playwright and political [[activism|activist]] whose [[feminism|feminist]] and [[Abolitionism in France|abolitionist]] writings reached a large audience. She was an early feminist who demanded that French women be given the same rights as French men. In her ''[[Declaration of the Rights of Woman and the Female Citizen]]'' (1791), she challenged the practice of [[patriarchy|male authority]] and the notion of male–female inequality. 
*[[Judith Sargent Murray]] (1751–1820) was an early [[United States|American]] advocate for women's rights, an essayist, [[playwright]], [[poet]], and letter writer. She was one of the first American proponents of the idea of the equality of the sexes—that women, like men, had the capability of intellectual accomplishment and should be able to achieve economic independence. Among many other influential pieces, her landmark essay "[[On the Equality of the Sexes]]" paved the way for new thoughts and ideas proposed by other [[Feminism|feminist]] writers of the century. The essay predated [[Mary Wollstonecraft]]'s ''[[A Vindication of the Rights of Woman]]'' which was published in 1792.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hughes|first1=Mary|title=An Enlightened Woman: Judith Sargent Murray and the Call to Equality|journal=[[Pittsburgh Undergraduate Review|Undergraduate Review]]|date=2011|volume=7|issue=21|url=http://vc.bridgew.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1196&amp;context=undergrad_rev|accessdate=25 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*[[Mary Wollstonecraft]] (1759-1797) was an English writer, philosopher, and advocate of [[women's rights]]. She is regarded as one of the founding [[feminist philosophy|feminist philosophers]]. In ''[[A Vindication of the Rights of Woman]]'' (1792), her most famous and influential work,&lt;ref&gt;Tomalin, 144–155; Wardle, 115ff; Sunstein, 192–202.&lt;/ref&gt; she argues that women are not naturally inferior to men, but appear to be only because they lack education. She suggests that both men and women should be treated as rational beings and imagines a [[social order]] founded on reason.

====19th century====
*[[Harriet Martineau]] (1802–1876) was an English [[social theorist]] and political writer, often cited as the first female [[sociologist]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated2002"&gt;Hill, Michael R. (2002) [https://books.google.com/books?id=qyzyUpMfh24C&amp;printsec=frontcover ''Harriet Martineau: Theoretical and Methodological Perspectives'']. Routledge. {{ISBN|0-415-94528-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; She wrote books and essays from a sociological, holistic, religious, domestic, and feminine perspective.  In ''Society in America'', she criticised the state of women's education, stating that the "intellect of women is confined by an unjustifiable restriction" of access to education; she urged women to become well-educated and free.
*[[Harriet Taylor Mill]] (1807–1858) was a philosopher and [[women's rights]] advocate. In [[John Stuart Mill]]'s autobiography, he claimed she was the joint author of most of the books and articles published under his name. He stated that "when two persons have their thoughts and speculations completely in common it is of little consequence, in respect of the question of originality, which of them holds the pen." Together, they wrote "Early Essays on Marriage and Divorce", published in 1832.&lt;ref name=Tong&gt;{{cite book|author=Tong, Rosemarie|title=Feminist Thought: A More Comprehensive Introduction|year=2009|publisher=Westview Press (Perseus Books)|isbn=978-0-8133-4375-4|page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The debate about the nature and extent of her collaboration is ongoing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/search/searcher.py?query=harriet+taylor+mill|title=Search (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)|author=|date=|website=plato.stanford.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Sarah Margaret Fuller]] (1810-1850) was an American journalist, critic, philosopher and [[women's rights]] advocate. Her book ''[[Woman in the Nineteenth Century]]'' is considered the first major [[feminism|feminist]] work in the United States. She was an advocate of women's rights and, in particular, women's education and the right to employment. Many other advocates for women's rights and feminism, including [[Susan B. Anthony]], cite Fuller as a source of inspiration.
*[[Antoinette Brown Blackwell]] (1825–1921) was the first woman to be ordained as a mainstream Protestant minister in the [[United States]]. She was a well-versed public speaker on controversial issues such as [[abolition of slavery]] and she sought to expand [[women's rights]]. In 1873 Blackwell founded the Association for the Advancement of Women.
*[[Victoria, Lady Welby]] (1837–1912) was a self-educated English [[philosopher of language]]. She was published articles in the leading English language academic journals of the day, ''[[Mind (journal)|Mind]]'' and ''[[The Monist]]''. She published her first philosophical book, ''What Is Meaning?  Studies in the Development of Significance'' in 1903, following it with ''Significs and Language: The Articulate Form of Our Expressive and Interpretive Resources'' in 1911. Welby's concern with the problem of meaning included (perhaps especially) the everyday use of language, and she coined the word ''significs'' for her approach. Welby's theories on signification anticipated contemporary [[semantics]], [[semiotics]], and [[semiology]]. 
*[[Bertha von Suttner]] (1843–1914) was a [[Czechs|Czech]]-[[Austrians|Austrian]] [[Pacifism|pacifist]] and novelist. In 1905 she was the first woman to be awarded the [[Nobel Peace Prize]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/lists/women.html|title=Nobel Prize Awarded Women|author=|date=|website=www.nobelprize.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Suttner's pacifism was influenced by the writings of [[Immanuel Kant]], [[Henry Thomas Buckle]], [[Herbert Spencer]], [[Charles Darwin]] and [[Leo Tolstoy]] (Tolstoy praised ''Die Waffen nieder!'').&lt;ref name="weop"&gt;''Bertha von Suttner'' by [[Irwin Adams]].

*[[Helene von Druskowitz]] (1856–1918) was an Austrian philosopher, writer and music critic. She was the second woman to obtain a Doctorate in Philosophy, which she obtained in [[Zürich]]. She usually published under a male alias because of the predominant [[sexism]] of the era.
*[[Charlotte Perkins Gilman]] (1860–1935) was an American [[feminist]], [[sociologist]], novelist, writer and [[social reform]]er. Her short story "[[The Yellow Wallpaper]]" became a bestseller. The story is about a woman who suffers from mental illness after three months of being closeted in a room by her husband.

Lane, ''To Herland and Beyond'', 230.&lt;/ref&gt; Gilman argued that women's contributions to civilization, throughout history, have been halted because of an [[androcentrism|androcentric]] culture.

====Early 20th century====
*[[Mary Whiton Calkins]] (1863–1930) was an American [[philosopher]] and [[psychologist]]. She was also the first woman to become president of the [[American Psychological Association]] and the [[American Philosophical Association]]. Calkins studied psychology under [[William James]] and studied at [[Harvard University]], which allowed her to attend courses but refused to register her as a student, because she was a woman. She published her doctoral dissertation in 1896, and Harvard's Department of Philosophy and Psychology recommended that she be granted her PhD, but Harvard's President and board refused, as she was a woman. The President believed women should not study with men.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Furumoto | first1 = L | year = 1980 | title = Mary Whiton Calkins (1863-1930) | url = | journal = Psychology of Women Quarterly | volume = 5 | issue = | pages = 55–68 | doi=10.1111/j.1471-6402.1981.tb01033.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Furumoto | first1 = L | year = 1979 | title = Mary Whiton Calkins (1863-1930) fourteenth president of the American Psychological Association | url = | journal = Journal of the History of the Behavioral Sciences | volume = 15 | issue = | pages = 346–356 | doi=10.1002/1520-6696(197910)15:4&lt;346::aid-jhbs2300150408&gt;3.0.co;2-z}}&lt;/ref&gt; James was astonished at the university's decision, as he described her performance as "the most brilliant examination for the Ph.D. that we have had at Harvard." &lt;ref name="Hilgard, E.

*[[Emma Goldman]] (1869–1940) was an [[anarchism|anarchist]] known for her political activism, writing and speeches. She played a pivotal role in the development of [[anarchist political philosophy]] in the first half of the 20th century. She was viewed as a [[free-thinking]] "rebel woman" by admirers, and denounced by critics as an advocate of violent revolution.&lt;ref name="Voices"&gt;{{cite book |last=Streitmatter|first=Rodger|title=Voices of Revolution: The Dissident Press in America|publisher=[[Columbia University Press]]|year =2001|location=New York|pages=122–134|isbn=0-231-12249-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her writing and lectures spanned a wide variety of issues, including [[atheism]], [[freedom of speech]], [[militarism]], [[capitalism]], marriage, [[free love]], and homosexuality. Although she distanced herself from [[first-wave feminism]] and its efforts toward [[women's suffrage]], she developed ways of incorporating gender politics into anarchism. 
*[[Rosa Luxemburg]] (1871–1919) was a [[Marxist theory|Marxist theorist]], [[Philosophy|philosopher]], [[Economics|economist]] and [[Revolutionary socialism|revolutionary socialist]] of [[Polish-Jewish]] descent. While Luxemburg defended Marx's materialism dialectics and his conception of history, she called for spontaneous [[grass roots]]-based [[class struggle]].

===Contemporary philosophy===
[[File:Hannah_arendt-150x150.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Hannah Arendt]] (1906–1975) considered herself a political theorist, but she is often described as a philosopher.]]
[[Contemporary philosophy]] is the present period in the history of [[Western philosophy]] beginning at the end of the 19th century with the [[professionalization]] of the discipline and the rise of [[Analytic philosophy|analytic]] and [[continental philosophy]]. Some influential women philosophers from this period include:
*[[Ayn Rand]] (1905-1982) developed a philosophical system she named [[Objectivism (Ayn Rand)|Objectivism]], which affirms [[objective reality]] and advocates holding [[reason]] as absolute.&lt;ref&gt;http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/objectivity.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/reason.html&lt;/ref&gt; In [[ethics]], Rand championed [[rational egoism]] and [[individualism]].&lt;ref&gt;http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/self-interest.html&lt;/ref&gt; In [[politics]], she advocated for [[individual rights]] and [[capitalism]].&lt;ref&gt;http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/individual_rights.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/capitalism.html&lt;/ref&gt; In [[esthetics]],  she upheld [[romanticism]].&lt;ref&gt;http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/romanticism.html&lt;/ref&gt; Rand regards [[Aristotle]] as her sole major philosophical influence.&lt;ref&gt;http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/aristotle.html&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Susanne Langer]] (1895–1985) was an American [[philosopher]] of [[philosopher of mind|mind]] and of [[philosopher of art|art]], who was influenced by [[Ernst Cassirer]] and [[Alfred North Whitehead]]. She was one of the first women to achieve an academic career in [[philosophy]] and the first woman to be popularly and professionally recognized as an American philosopher. Langer is best known for her 1942 book entitled ''[[Philosophy in a New Key]]''. It argued that there is a basic and pervasive human need to symbolize, to invent meanings, and to invest meanings in one’s world.&lt;ref name="gardner1"&gt;{{Citation|author=[[Howard Gardner]]|title=Art, Mind, and Brain: A Cognitive Approach to Creativity|chapter=Philosophy in a New Key Revisited: An Appreciation of Susanne Langer |publisher=Basic Books|pages=48–54|location=New York|url=http://www.anthonyflood.com/gardnerlanger.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Hannah Arendt]] (1906–1975) was a [[Germany|German]]-born [[Americans|American]] [[Jewish assimilation|assimilated]] [[Jews|Jewish]] [[political theory|political theorist]]. Though often described as a philosopher, she rejected that label on the grounds that philosophy is concerned with "man in the singular" and instead described herself as a political theorist because her work centers on the fact that "men, not Man, live on the earth and inhabit the world."&lt;ref&gt;Arendt, Hannah. ''The Human Condition''. 2nd ed. Chicago: University of Chicago, 1998.&lt;!-- isbn needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Her works deal with the nature of [[power (sociology)|power]], and the subjects of politics, [[direct democracy]], [[authority]], and [[totalitarianism]]. The [[Hannah Arendt Prize]] is named in her honor.
[[File:Simone de Beauvoir.jpg|thumb|right|160px|[[Simone de Beauvoir]] (1908–1986) was a French writer, intellectual, [[Existentialism|existentialist philosopher]], political activist, [[feminist]] and [[social theorist]].]]
*[[Simone de Beauvoir]] (1908–1986) was a French writer, intellectual, [[Existentialism|existentialist philosopher]], political activist, [[feminist]] and [[social theorist]]. Though she did not consider herself a philosopher, she had a significant influence on both [[feminist existentialism]] and [[feminist theory]].&lt;ref name="plato.stanford"&gt;Bergoffen, Debra, "Simone de Beauvoir", ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' (Fall 2010 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL = &lt;http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2010/entries/beauvoir/&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; De Beauvoir wrote novels, essays, biographies, autobiography and [[monograph]]s on philosophy, politics and social issues. She is known for her 1949 treatise ''[[The Second Sex]]'', a detailed analysis of women's oppression and a foundational tract of contemporary [[feminism]].
*[[Elizabeth Anscombe]] (1919–2001), usually cited as G. E. M. Anscombe, was a British [[analytic philosophy|analytic philosopher]]. Anscombe's 1958 article "[[Modern Moral Philosophy]]" introduced the term "[[consequentialism]]" into the language of analytic philosophy, and had a seminal influence on contemporary [[virtue ethics]]. Her monograph ''[[Intention (book)|Intention]]'' is generally recognised as her greatest and most influential work, and the continuing philosophical interest in the concepts of [[Intention (philosophy)|intention]], [[Action (philosophy)|action]] and [[practical reasoning]] can be said to have taken its main impetus from this work.  [[Mary Warnock]] described her in 2006 as "the undoubted giant among women philosophers" while [[John Joseph Haldane|John Haldane]] said she "certainly has a good claim to be the greatest woman philosopher of whom we know".&lt;ref name="Haldane"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Haldane|first=John|title=In Memoriam: G. E. M. Anscombe (1919–2001)|journal=The Review of Metaphysics|date=June 2000|volume=53|issue=4|pages=1019–1021|jstor=20131480}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Mary Midgley]] (born 1919) is an English [[ethics|moral philosopher]]. A senior lecturer in philosophy at [[Newcastle University]], she is known for her work on science, ethics and [[animal rights]]. Midgley strongly opposes [[reductionism]] and [[scientism]], and any attempts to make science a substitute for the humanities—a role for which it is, she argues, wholly inadequate. She has written extensively about what philosophers can learn from nature, particularly from animals. ''The Guardian'' has described her as a fiercely combative philosopher and the UK's "foremost scourge of 'scientific pretension.'"&lt;ref name=brown2001&gt;{{cite web|last=Brown|first=Andrew|title=Mary, Mary, quite contrary|url=https://www.theguardian.com/saturday_review/story/0,3605,421561,00.html|work=The Guardian|date=13 January 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Mary Warnock]] (born 1924) is a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[philosopher]] of [[ethics|morality]], [[philosophy of education|education]] and [[philosophy of mind|mind]], and writer on [[existentialism]]. From 1984 to 1991, she was [[Master (college)|Mistress]] of [[Girton College, Cambridge]]. Warnock studied at [[Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford|Lady Margaret Hall]], [[University of Oxford|Oxford]], and was made an Honorary Fellow in 1984. She delivered the [[Gifford Lectures]], entitled "Imagination and Understanding," at the [[University of Glasgow]] in 1992. She has written extensively on [[ethics]], [[existentialism]] and [[philosophy of mind]].&lt;ref name=Honderich&gt;{{cite book|last=Honderich|first=Ted|title=The Oxford Companion to Philosophy|year=1995|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=0-19-866132-0|page=907|edition=1. publ.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Philippa Foot]] (1920-2010) was a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Philosophy|philosopher]], most notable for her works in [[ethics]]. She was one of the founders of contemporary [[virtue ethics]], inspired by the ethics of [[Aristotle]]. Her later career marked a significant change in view from her work in the 1950s and '60s, and may be seen as an attempt to modernize [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] ethical theory, to show that it is adaptable to a contemporary world view, and thus, that it could compete with such popular theories as modern [[deontology|deontological]] and [[utilitarianism|utilitarian]] ethics.  Some of her work was crucial in the re-emergence of [[normative ethics]] within [[analytic philosophy]], especially her critique of [[consequentialism]] and of [[non-cognitivism]]. A familiar example is the continuing discussion of an example of hers referred to as the [[trolley problem]]. Foot's approach was influenced by the later work of [[Wittgenstein]], although she rarely dealt explicitly with materials treated by him.
*[[Patricia Churchland]] (born 1943) is a Canadian-American [[philosopher]] noted for her contributions to [[neurophilosophy]] and the [[philosophy of mind]]. She is UC President's professor of philosophy emerita at the [[University of California, San Diego]] (UCSD), where she has taught since 1984. Educated at the [[University of British Columbia]], the [[University of Pittsburgh]], and the [[University of Oxford]], she taught philosophy at the [[University of Manitoba]] from 1969 to 1984.
*[[Susan Haack]] (born 1945) is distinguished professor in the humanities, professor of philosophy, and professor of law at the University of Miami. She earned her PhD at [[Cambridge University]]. She has written on [[logic]], the [[philosophy of language]], [[epistemology]], and [[metaphysics]]. Her [[pragmatism]] follows that of [[Charles Sanders Peirce]]. Haack's major contribution to philosophy is her [[epistemology|epistemological]] theory called [[foundherentism]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Aune | first1 = B. | title = Haack's ''Evidence and Inquiry''| journal = Philosophy and Phenomenological Research | volume = 56 | issue = 3 | pages = 627–632 | doi = 10.2307/2108389 | year = 1996 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Flage | first1 = D.

The '''World Checklist of Selected Plant Families''' (usually abbreviated to '''WCSP''') is an "international collaborative programme that provides the latest peer reviewed and published opinions on the accepted [[Botanical nomenclature|scientific names]] and [[Synonym (taxonomy)#Botany|synonyms]] of selected plant families."&lt;ref name=WCSP_home/&gt; Maintained by the [[Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew]], it is available online, allowing searches for the names of families, genera and species, as well as the ability to create checklists. 

The project traces its history to work done in the 1990s by Kew researcher [[Rafaël Govaerts]] on a checklist of the genus ''[[Quercus]]''. Influenced by the [[Global Strategy for Plant Conservation]], the project expanded. {{Asof|2013|January}}, 173 families of [[seed plant]]s were included.&lt;ref name=WCSP_home/&gt; Coverage of [[monocotyledon]] families is complete; other families are being added.&lt;ref name=WCSP_about/&gt;

There is a complementary project called the [[International Plant Names Index]] (IPNI), in which Kew is also involved. The IPNI aims to provide details of publication and does not aim to determine which are accepted species names. After a delay of about a year, newly published names are automatically added from the IPNI to the WCSP.&lt;ref name=WCSP_about/&gt; The WCSP is also one of the underlying databases for [[The Plant List]], created by Kew and the [[Missouri Botanical Garden]], which was unveiled in 2010.&lt;ref name="Discovery"&gt;{{Citation | url=http://news.discovery.com/earth/plant-database-library-101229.html | title=World's Largest Plants Database Assembled | date=2010 | publisher=Discovery News}}&lt;/ref&gt;
