The '''Alabama International Trade Center''' was created in 1979 as one of the first ''international SBDCs''.  Since its inception, the AITC has provided export trade research, education, finance, and training throughout [[Alabama]].  

==History &amp; Personnel==

Dr. William R. Bennett, Emeritus Professor of Marketing and International Business at [[the University of Alabama]], founded the Trade Center in 1979.  AITC was one of the first university-based small business development centers in the country that focused specifically on international trade.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.asbdc-us.org/About_Us/aboutus_history.html ASBDC History&lt;/ref&gt;  Following Dr. Bennett's retirement in 1983, Ms. Nisa Miranda, who had helped Bennett establish the Center while completing her MBA, was promoted to Director.  Miranda would oversee the Center's growth and development for the next 21 years, helping the Center become designated as SBA's State Model of Excellence in International Trade.&lt;ref&gt;[http://aitc.ua.edu/aitc-history Official Website]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sba.gov/advo/models.pdf SBA Office of Advocacy]&lt;/ref&gt; (Miranda has since moved on to become Director of the University of Alabama's Center for Economic Development.

In 2004, Mr. Brian Davis, who had served as the Trade Center's Associate Director since 1985, took over as Director.  Davis is the former president of the Alabama World Trade Association (AWTA) and [[NASBITE International]].  In addition to serving on the University's Advisory Board for International Business, Davis also teaches an import-export class at the Culverhouse College of Commerce &amp; Business Administration.

AITC currently employs several consultants:
*Michael J. Brooks, Assistant Director - Research &amp; Training
*Carolyn Turner, International Trade Specialist
*Pablo Diaz, Export Trade Consultant
*Deborah van der Toorn, Export Trade Consultant
*Amber Summers, Project Accountant
*Karla Jordan, Administrative Assistant

In addition to the professional staff, AITC employs up to 20 Research Fellows as part of its research staff.  The Research Fellows are hired on a competitive basis, and consist of graduate and undergraduate students with expertise in market research, business strategy, foreign relations, political science, and foreign languages.&lt;ref&gt;[http://aitc.ua.edu/student-success Official Website]&lt;/ref&gt;  Mr. Brooks has been in charge of hiring and training the research staff since 1998; Brooks also serves as the Center's Senior International Trade Specialist.

The Trade Center is part of the Alabama Small Business Development Center Network, a statewide network of 10 management and technical assistance centers.

The '''Small Business Administration''' ('''SBA''') is a United States government agency that provides support to small businesses.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sba.gov/aboutsba/index.html Small Business Administration]&lt;/ref&gt; The SBA was created by way of the '''Small Business Act''' of July 30, 1953.

==Export Alabama Trade Alliance==

Export Alabama is a group of government agencies, business and professional associations, and economic development entities in Alabama that share the fundamental goal of helping Alabama companies to grow their business internationally.&lt;ref&gt;[http://exportalabama.com/ Export Alabama]&lt;/ref&gt; The list of Export Alabama partners includes:

The '''Alex. Brown &amp; Sons building''' is a historical structure located at 135 East [[Baltimore Street]] in [[Baltimore, Maryland]]. During the 20th century it served as the [[corporate headquarters]] for the banking firm [[Alex. Brown &amp; Sons]], the oldest in the United States when it was purchased by [[Bankers Trust]] in 1997.  The two story building, completed in 1901 and designed by the partnership of J. Harleston Parker and Douglas H. Thomas. Jr., survived the 1904 [[Great Baltimore Fire|Baltimore fire]]. The building was modified on the [[Calvert Street (Baltimore)|Calvert Street]] side and in the interior by the firm Beecher, Friz, and Gregg in 1905.&lt;ref&gt;Dorsey, John &amp; Dilts, James D., ''Guide to Baltimore Architecture'' (1997) p. 151-2.

Keys, III|publisher=Maryland Historical Trust}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The building was sold to [[Chevy Chase Bank]] in 1997. A plaque on the side of the building states:

&lt;blockquote&gt;A thorough historical renovation of the building was completed in 1996 when it was reopened as a traditional retail bank branch. The beautiful stained glass dome, probably the work of Baltimore artist Gustave Baumstark (who studied under both [[Louis Comfort Tiffany|Louis C. Tiffany]] and [[John LaFarge]]) was cleaned and refurbished. The marble columns and the plaster moldings of the great banking hall were restored to their original designs. During the renovation the original [[Bank teller|teller]] line was reconstructed. Even such details as the design and placement of the freestanding furniture now in existence in the bank branch were designed to mimic the original furniture.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Alex. Brown &amp; Sons Building was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1982.&lt;ref name="nris"/&gt;

==Biography==
===Childhood and youth===
[[Image:Alfredo De Angelis - ruralista.jpg|thumb|left|Alfredo de Angeli, small farmer and businessman, rural leader, member of the [[Federación Agraria Argentina]] (Argentinian Agricultural Federation) of [[Entre Ríos Province|Entre Ríos]].]]
One of nine brothers, he was born and spent his early years in the [[Paraná, Entre Ríos|Paraná]] department. In July 1980, he settled in Gualeguaychú, in a town named [[Arroyo El Sauce]]. 
He has an identical [[twin]] named Atilio, with whom he is usually confused, and who is also his partner in their business society. His twin is the one who dedicates all his time to the agricultural activity, while Alfredo splits his time between his job and his role as rural leader.
Their society rents between 675 and 1,100 hectares (according to different sources) to different owners. 
&lt;ref&gt;''“I've been a settler with the Yabrán family for 10 years.”, says De Angeli'', [http://www.diarioperfil.com.ar/edimp/0255/articulo.php?art=7054&amp;ed=0255] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080525110113/http://www.diarioperfil.com.ar/edimp/0255/articulo.php?art=7054&amp;ed=0255 |date=2008-05-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
They cultivate [[soybean]], [[maize|corn]], [[sunflower]] and [[crop]]. Nowadays he lives in a house near the beach of [[El Ñandubaysal]] at Gualeguaychú.

He is a member of the famous industrialist [[Agnelli family]]. He is also a board member of [[FIAT]] and [[Exor (company)|Exor]].

==Early life==
Agnelli is the son of late Juventus F.C. chairman and [[Italian Senate|senator]] of the [[Italian Republic]] [[Umberto Agnelli]], [[chief executive officer|CEO]] of [[Fiat]] from 1970–1976, and Donna Allegra [[Caracciolo]] di Castagneto, first cousin of [[Marella Agnelli]], born Donna Marella Caracciolo di Castagneto and daughter of Filippo Caracciolo, 8th Prince di Castagneto, 3rd Duke di Melito, and a hereditary [[Patrician (post-Roman Europe)|Patrician]] of Naples (1903-1965). Marella, widow of Agnelli's uncle [[Gianni Agnelli|Gianni]], and Allegra and, therefore, Andrea, are both members of and old [[Naples|Neapolitan]] [[Nobility|noble]] family that hold the titles of Prince of Castagneto and Duke of Melito, among others.

Andrea was the last male member of the family to carry the [[Agnelli]] surname until the birth of his son Giacomo. He studied at [[St Clare's, Oxford|St Clare's]] in [[Oxford]], England and then at [[Bocconi University]] in [[Milan]].

==Career==
After university, Agnelli started his career in the business world  in England and France at companies including [[Iveco]] and [[Auchan|Auchan Hypermarché]]. He also spent several years in [[Switzerland]] working in [[marketing]] and development for [[Ferrari]] Idea S.A. and [[Lausanne]]-based [[Philip Morris International]].

===Juventus F.C.===
In May 2010 he was appointed Chairman of the board of directors of [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]] by his first cousin [[John Elkann]], becoming the fourth member of the [[Agnelli family]] to run the football club after his father, his uncle and his grandfather.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lastampa.it/sport/cmsSezioni/quijuve/201004articoli/26580girata.asp |title=Juve, John Elkann disegna il futuro "Andrea Agnelli sarà il presidente" |language=Italian |trans-title=Juve, John Elkann marks the future: "Andrea Agnelli will be the chairman" |publisher=[[La Stampa]] |date=28 April 2010 |accessdate=1 June 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120130065347/http://www.lastampa.it/sport/cmsSezioni/quijuve/201004articoli/26580girata.asp |archivedate=30 January 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Elkann had come under criticism from Juventus fans for the club's poor results during the [[2009–10 Serie A|2009–10 season]] and many [[Juventus Ultras|ultras]] saw Agnelli as the "rightful" heir due to his family's long-time association with the club. Despite entering the job during a period when the club was still dealing with the aftermath of the infamous ''[[Calciopoli]]'' scandal, he is credited with overseeing the club's transition into the [[Juventus Stadium|new stadium]] and balancing their finances in wake of the [[Late-2000s recession in Europe#Italy|ongoing recession]] ravaging Italy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Stadio, Vinovo, marchio e rosa: la Juve vale di più|url=http://www.tuttosport.com/calcio/serie_a/juventus/2011/10/10-148539/Stadio,+Vinovo,+marchio+e+rosa%3A+la+Juve+vale+di+pi%C3%B9|publisher=[[Tuttosport]]|date=10 October 2011|language=Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=La Juventus e il nuovo stadio, "29" scudetti nello spogliatoio|url=http://www.repubblica.it/rubriche/spycalcio/2011/10/05/news/la_juventus_e_il_nuovo_stadio-22724162/|publisher=[[La Repubblica]]|date=5 October 2011|language=Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of his first acts as new chairman was to appoint [[U.C. Sampdoria|Sampdoria]] duo [[Giuseppe Marotta]] as Director of Sport and [[Luigi Delneri]] as new coach.

On 22 May 2011, Agnelli appointed former captain and fan favourite [[Antonio Conte]] as the new manager of Juventus, replacing Delneri.

The road, in its present form, took shape during the time of [[George Macartney, 1st Earl Macartney|Charles Macartney]] who served as [[Governor of Madras]]. With the construction of Marmalong Bridge in 1724, the road started gaining prominence. In the following years, the road became part of the city's central business district which originally covered only [[George Town, Chennai|George Town]].&lt;ref name="CMDA_StructureOfChennai"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, most of Chennai's business and corporate offices are located on Anna Salai.

By the 1800s, Mount Road has become the traders' area of the city of Madras while First Line Beach in Georgetown remained the seat of processing, shipping and manufacturing businesses. However, the business activities of Mount Road was responsible for the city's economic growth. Several giant firms had beginnings on Mount Road, from the Amalgamations group to the TVS group. The road's proximity to the Government House, the home of the Governor, and the palaces of the Nawabs of Arcot resulted in several firms selling cars and other luxury goods setting up shops on the road. Simpson &amp; Co, which moved to its current location opposite Government Estate after 1875, began building carriages and coaches and then cars. In 1903, the first steam-driven car was taken for its debut drive on Mount Road. To overcome the Great Depression of the 1930s, Simpon's introduced the [[hire purchase]] system for cars and trucks. In the 1930s, the TVS group, which was a travel operator in mofussil areas, was established in Madras by acquiring the Madras Auto Service property. In the 1940s, Anantharamakrishnan helped with the formation of Amalgamations &amp; Co. The city's first skyscraper, the LIC Building, was built in 1959. Several major firms were then established, namely, Spencers &amp; Co, Victoria Family Hotel (the present location of the Indian Overseas Bank Headquarters) and Higginbothams.&lt;ref name="takeovertycoons" /&gt;

==The Stretch==
[[File:Thomas Munro classic.jpg|thumb|200px|Statue of [[Sir Thomas Munro, 1st Baronet|Thomas Munro]] in [[The Island, Chennai]]]]
Anna Salai starts from the [[Parktown]] area of Chennai city where [[Chennai Central]] railway terminus is situated. It, then, traverses [[The Island, Chennai|the Island]] with its statue of Sir Thomas Munro to the other side of the Coovum before entering the neighbourhoods of [[Thousand Lights]] and [[Teynampet]] areas. From Teynampet, it continues straight southwards to [[Nandanam]] and [[Saidapet]] before traversing the [[Maraimalai Adigal Bridge]] across the [[Adyar River]] to [[Little Mount]] and finally, [[Guindy]]. Anna Salai is maintained by the [[Highways of Tamil Nadu|Tamil Nadu Highways Department]]. The road extends for a total of 11 kilometres and traverses the heart of the city.

By the 2010s, the stretch between [[Parry's Corner]] and [[Nandanam]] was used by over 16,000 vehicles during rush hour. Anna Salai is used by over 0.183 million vehicles every day.&lt;ref name="FlyoverWallMended"&gt;{{cite news

'''Anthony Joseph Drexel Biddle Jr.''' (December 17, 1897 - November 13, 1961) was a wealthy socialite who became a diplomat of the [[United States]], and served in the [[United States Army]] during [[World War I]] and after [[World War II]], reaching the rank of [[major general (United States)|major general]].&lt;ref name="NYT Obituary"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1961/11/14/archives/anthony-j-drexel-biddle-dead-ambassador-to-spain-was-64-envoy-and.html |title=Anthony J. Drexel Biddle Dead; Ambassador to Spain Was 64; Envoy and Officer in World War II -- Tributes Paid by Kennedy and Eisenhower |date=November 14, 1961 |work=The New York Times |access-date=July 8, 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Biddle was the son of millionaire [[Anthony Joseph Drexel Biddle Sr.]]  (1874–1948), and Cordelia Rundell Bradley (1873–1947). A member of the [[Biddle family]], he was born in [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]] on December 17, 1897.
His father, grandson of banker [[Anthony Joseph Drexel]] and great-grandson of banker [[Nicholas Biddle (banker)|Nicholas Biddle]], was an eccentric boxing fan. When he was ten years old, the younger Biddle was in an exhibition match with [[Bob Fitzsimmons]], who knocked him into a wall with a punch traveling about two inches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Letters to the editor |work= [[Life (magazine)|Life magazine]] |date= October 25, 1943 |page= 2 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=BVcEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA2  |accessdate= March 21, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He graduated from [[St. Paul's School (Concord, New Hampshire)|St. Paul's School]] in [[Concord, New Hampshire]] but never attended college.&lt;ref name="life"&gt;{{cite news |title=Ambassador Biddle: As multiple envoy to governments-in-exile, he is foremost U.S. expert on postwar plans and problems of Europe's courageous little nations |author= Noel F. Busch |work= [[Life (magazine)|Life magazine]] |date= October 4, 1943 |pages= 106–114, 117–120 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=PlcEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA107 |accessdate= March 21, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
In [[World War I]], he first enlisted as a private, and was promoted to rank of [[captain (United States)|captain]]. In the 1920s he engaged in several business ventures, which were known as social successes but financial failures. For example, he managed Belgian boxer René deVos, and invested in the [[St. Regis Hotel#St. Regis|St. Regis Hotel]]. A party he held for the boxer at the hotel was marked by the loss of many bottles of fine champagne (at great expense due to [[prohibition in the United States]]). "Guests" even tried to wheel out the piano before it was retrieved.&lt;ref name="life"/&gt;

Biddle also made a deal to rent part of [[Central Park]] in [[New York City]] and open an expensive nightclub called The Casino.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= The 1920s: The Casino |work= Central Park History web site |url= http://centralparkhistory.com/timeline/timeline_1920_casino.html |accessdate= March 21, 2011 }} Excerpt from ''The Park and the People: A History of Central Park'', Roy Rosenzweig and Elizabeth Blackmar {{ISBN|978-0-8014-9751-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
After the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929]] many of his investments failed. The Casino was raided and shut down.
In 1931 he and other directors of the bankrupt Sonora Products Corporation of America (formerly Acoustic Products Company, in the phonograph and radio business) were sued by the Irving Trust Company. The directors were accused of diverting profits from stock sales into their own accounts. A district court dismissed the claims against the defendants, but the dismissal of Biddle and several others was reversed on appeal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Business &amp; Finance: Suits |work= [[Time (magazine)|Time magazine]] |date= July 20, 1931 |url= http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,742073-1,00.html |accessdate= March 21, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Irving Trust Co. v.

===Diplomatic career===
After Biddle was appointed [[United States Ambassador to Norway|Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary to Norway]] on July 22, 1935, he settled the Irving case out of court to avoid a bond required before leaving the country to assume the post.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Foreign Service: Athletic Christian |work= [[Time (magazine)|Time magazine]] |date= August 5, 1935 |url= http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,711672,00.html |accessdate= March 20, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He presented his credentials on September 7, 1935. It was widely suspected he was a political appointee resulting from his support of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] and  [[George Howard Earle III]], its 1934 successful candidate for [[Governor of Pennsylvania]]. However, his social skills made him and his wife ideally suited to being a diplomat.&lt;ref name="life"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Do you know these U.S. Ambassadors? |work= [[Life (magazine)|Life magazine]] |date= November 28, 1938 |page= 25 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=Yk0EAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA25 |accessdate= March 21, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 4, 1937, he was promoted to [[United States Ambassador to Poland|Ambassador to Poland]] and presented his credentials in [[Warsaw, Poland]] on June 2, 1937.&lt;ref name="state"&gt;{{cite web |title= Anthony Joseph Drexel Biddle (1897–1961) |work= Biography by office of the Historian |publisher= US Department of State |url= https://history.state.gov/departmenthistory/people/biddle-anthony-joseph-drexel-jr |accessdate= March 20, 2011 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110319205320/http://history.state.gov/departmenthistory/people/biddle-anthony-joseph-drexel-jr| archivedate= 19 March 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In September 1939 [[German invasion of Poland|Germany invaded Poland]], which was a major cause of [[World War II]]. After Biddle's house was hit with bomb fragments, his family and embassy staff fled to various temporary quarters.&lt;ref name="Poland"/&gt; After the escape, he joined the [[Polish government in exile]] in France until June 1940, when he returned to the US after France was invaded.

On February 11, 1941, he also commissioned to the governments-in-exile of [[United States Ambassador to Belgium|Belgium]], [[United States Ambassador to Czechoslovakia|Czechoslovakia]], [[United States Ambassador to Greece|Greece]], [[United States Ambassador to Luxembourg|Luxembourg]], the [[United States Ambassador to the Netherlands|Netherlands]], [[United States Ambassador to Norway|Norway]], and [[United States Ambassador to Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]].  Biddle arrived in [[London]] on March 14, 1941, and continued as ambassador through 1943.&lt;ref name="state"/&gt;

===Later career===
In January 1944, Biddle resigned from the State Department and joined the Army as lieutenant colonel to serve on the staff of [[Dwight Eisenhower]].  His contacts with "underground" movements and free military units in occupied nations provided intelligence for the planning of [[Operation Overlord]], the Allied invasion of France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.nytimes.com/1944/01/23/archives/biddle-resigns-as-envoy-to-exiles-to-take-post-with-invasion-army-a.html |title= Biddle Resigns as Envoy to Exiles To Take Post With Invasion Army |newspaper= New York Times |date= January 23, 1944 |accessdate= March 20, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He continued on Eisenhower's staff supervising European reconstruction after the war ended.

In April 1955, he resigned from the Army to become Adjutant General of the [[Pennsylvania National Guard]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.nytimes.com/1955/04/14/archives/biddle-to-retire-as-ridgway-aide-general-former-ambassador-slated.html |title= Biddle to Retire as Ridgway Aide: General, Former Ambassador, Slated to Head National Guard in Pennsylvania  |newspaper= New York Times |date= April 14, 1955 |author= Tony Leviero  |accessdate= March 20, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, as an member of the [[United States Army Reserve|Army Reserve]], he was promoted to [[Major general (United States)|major general]] in August.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1955/08/02/archives/reserve-officers-approved-by-senate.html |title=RESERVE OFFICERS APPROVED BY SENATE |date=August 2, 1955 |work=The New York Times |access-date=July 8, 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1961, Biddle became the [[United States Ambassador to Spain]], though he did not speak Spanish fluently;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1961/02/25/archives/energetic-envoy-anthony-joseph-drexel-biddle-jr.html |title=Energetic Envoy; Anthony Joseph Drexel Biddle Jr. |date=February 25, 1961 |work=The New York Times |access-date=July 8, 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which he served until shortly before his death.&lt;ref name="NYT Obituary"/&gt;

==Personal life==
[[File:Mary Duke Biddle in 1916.jpg|thumb|Mary Duke Biddle in 1916]]
On June 16, 1915, Biddle married [[Mary Duke Biddle|Mary Lillian Duke]] (1887–1960), a tobacco heiress who was the daughter of [[Benjamin Newton Duke]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Miss Duke's bridal party: Plans for Her Marriage to A.

His second wife, whom he married in 1931, was Margaret Thompson Schulze (d. 1956), the only child of mining magnate [[William Boyce Thompson]] and recent divorcee of Theodore M. Schultze, a New York banker.&lt;ref name="MBObit1956"/&gt;  Through this marriage he had two stepchildren, (Margaret) Boyce Schulze and Theodore Schulze Jr, as well as a son before their divorce in 1945:&lt;ref name="MBObit1956"&gt;{{cite news |title=MARGARET BIDDLE IS DEAD IN PARIS; American Heiress Wrote for U.S., French Publications --Shared in $85,000,000 Opened Home to Notables Honored in Yonkers Special to The New York Times. |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1956/06/09/archives/margaret-biddle-is-dead-in-paris-american-heiress-wrote-for-us.html |accessdate=4 June 2018 |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=9 June 1956}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legacy===
His sister Cordelia Drexel Biddle wrote a book with Kyle Crichton about the family, focusing on her marriage with [[Angier Buchanan Duke]] who was the brother of Anthony's first wife. It was made into a play and the 1967 musical film ''[[The Happiest Millionaire]]''.
He was portrayed by [[Paul Petersen]] in the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title |id=0061749 |title=The Happiest Millionaire}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''chief technology officer''' ('''CTO'''), sometimes known as a '''chief technical officer''' or '''chief technologist''', is an executive-level position in a company or other entity whose occupation is focused on scientific and technological issues within an organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Smith|first1=Roger D.|title=The Chief Technology Officer: Strategic Responsibilities and Relationships|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/08956308.2003.11671574}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
After World War II, large corporations established research laboratories at locations separate from their headquarters. Their goal was to hire scientists and offer them facilities to research on behalf of the company without the burdens of day-to-day office work. 

At that time, the director of the laboratory was a corporate vice president who did not participate in the company’s corporate decisions. Instead, this technical director was the responsible for attracting new scientists, do research, and develop products.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=F.|first=Larson, Charles|date=2001-11-01|title=Management for the New Millennium-The Challenge of Change. (One Point of View)|url=https://www.questia.com/library/journal/1G1-80346387/management-for-the-new-millennium-the-challenge-of|journal=Research-Technology Management|language=en|volume=44|issue=6|issn=0895-6308}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the '80s, the role of these research directors changed substantially. Since technology was becoming a substantial part of most products and services, companies needed an operational executive who could understand the product’s technical side and provide advice on ways to improve and develop it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lewis|first=W.W.|last2=Lawrence|first2=H.L.|date=1990|title=A new mission for corporate technology|url=|journal=A new mission for corporate technology. Sloan Management Review, 31(4).|volume=31|pages=57-67|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==

A chief technology officer (CTO) "examines the short and long term needs of an organization, and utilizes capital to make investments designed to help the organization reach its objectives... [the CTO] is the highest technology executive position within a company and leads the technology or engineering department".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/chief-technology-officer.asp|title=Chief Technology Officer - CTO|last=Staff|first=Investopedia|date=2011-07-11|work=Investopedia|access-date=2017-12-12|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The role became prominent with the ascent of the [[information technology]] (IT) industry, but has since become prevalent in technology-based industries of all types—including computer based technologies (such as [[Video game developer|game developer]], [[e-commerce]], and [[social networking service]]) and other/non-computer-focused technology (such as [[Biotechnology|biotech]]/[[Pharmaceutical industry|pharma]], [[Defense industry|defense]], and [[Automotive industry|automotive]]). In non-technical organizations as a corporate officer position, the CTO typically reports directly to the [[chief information officer]] (CIO) and is primarily concerned with long-term and "big picture" issues (while still having deep technical knowledge of the relevant field). In technology-focused organizations, the CIO and CTO positions can be at the same level, with the CIO focused on the information technology and the CTO focused on the core company and other supporting technologies.

Depending on company structure and hierarchy, there may also be positions such as director of R&amp;D and vice president of engineering whom the CTO interacts with or oversees. The CTO also needs a working familiarity with regulatory (e.g. U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]], [[Environmental Protection Agency]], [[Consumer Product Safety Commission]], as applicable) and intellectual property (IP) issues (e.g. [[patent]]s, [[trade secret]]s, license contracts), and an ability to interface with legal counsel to incorporate those considerations into strategic planning and inter-company negotiations.

In many older industries (whose existence may predate IT automation) such as manufacturing, shipping or banking, an executive role of the CTO would often arise out of the process of automating existing activities; in these cases, any CTO-like role would only emerge if and when efforts would be made to develop truly novel technologies (either for facilitating internal operations or for enhancing products/services being provided), perhaps through "[[intrapreneur]]ing".

A '''corporate accelerator''' is a specific form of [[seed accelerator]] which is sponsored by an established for-profit corporation. Similar to seed accelerators they support early-stage [[Startup company|startup companies]] through [[mentorship]] and often capital and office space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Accelerating Entrepreneurs and Ecosystems: The Seed Accelerator Model |journal=Innovation Policy and the Economy |date=2015 |last=Hochberg |first=Yael |volume=16 |page=24|accessdate=2015-06-17 |url=https://www.nber.org/chapters/c13584.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to regular programs, though, corporate accelerators derive their objectives from the sponsoring organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://corporate-accelerators.net/2015/06/15/what-is-a-corporate-accelerator.html |title=What are Corporate Accelerators? |last=Heinemann |first=Florian |date=2015-06-15 |accessdate=2015-06-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These objectives can include the wish to stay close to emerging trends or to establish a funnel for corporate [[venture capital]] investments.

According to [https://corporate-accelerators.net/database/index.html Corporate Accelerator DB] there are 70+ such programs in existence as of December 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://corporate-accelerators.net/database/index.html |title=Corporate Accelerator Database |last=Heinemann |first=Florian |accessdate=2015-06-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Notable companies include [[Microsoft]], [[Citrix]], and [[Telefónica]] who were among the first companies to offer such programs in the early 2010s. More recently, corporate accelerators have faced criticism as they might be less effective as regular seed accelerators. For example, the startup could be too focused on solving the problems of the sponsoring firm rather than finding external customers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://techcrunch.com/2014/08/25/corporate-accelerators-are-an-oxymoron/ |title=Corporate Accelerators Are An Oxymoron |last=Crichton |first=Danny |date=2014-08-25 |accessdate=2015-06-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Corporate accelerators differ from [[Business incubators]], which usually have a continuous intake, due to their fixed-term, cohort-based organization (similar to seed accelerators) and are distinct to [[corporate venture capital]] which is a direct, targeted investment.

'''Data vault modeling''' is a [[database]] modeling method that is designed to provide long-term historical storage of [[data]] coming in from multiple operational systems. It is also a method of looking at historical data that deals with issues such as auditing, tracing of data, loading speed and resilience to change as well as emphasizing the need to trace where all the data in the database came from. This means that every [[Row (database)|row]] in a data vault must be accompanied by record source and load date attributes, enabling an auditor to trace values back to the source.

Data vault modeling makes no distinction between good and bad data ("bad" meaning not conforming to business rules).&lt;ref&gt;[[#dvsuper|Super Charge your data warehouse]], page 74&lt;/ref&gt; This is summarized in the statement that a data vault stores "a single version of the facts" (also expressed by Dan Linstedt as "all the data, all of the time") as opposed to the practice in other data warehouse methods of storing "a [[single version of the truth]]"&lt;ref&gt;[[#rdamhof1|The next generation EDW]]&lt;/ref&gt; where data that does not conform to the definitions is removed or "cleansed".

The modeling method is designed to be resilient to change in the business environment where the data being stored is coming from, by explicitly separating structural information from descriptive attributes.&lt;ref&gt;[[#dvsuper|Super Charge your data warehouse]], page 21&lt;/ref&gt; Data vault is designed to enable parallel loading as much as possible,&lt;ref&gt;[[#dvsuper|Super Charge your data warehouse]], page 76&lt;/ref&gt; so that very large implementations can scale out without the need for major redesign.

== History and philosophy ==

In [[data warehouse]] modeling there are two well-known competing options for modeling the layer where the data are stored. Either you model according to [[Ralph Kimball]], with conformed dimensions and an enterprise data bus, or you model according to [[Bill Inmon]] with the database [[normal forms|normalized]]. Both techniques have issues when dealing with changes in the systems feeding the data warehouse. For conformed dimensions you also have to cleanse data (to conform it) and this is undesirable in a number of cases since this inevitably will lose information. Data vault is designed to avoid or minimize the impact of those issues, by moving them to areas of the data warehouse that are outside the historical storage area (cleansing is done in the data marts) and by separating the structural items (business keys and the associations between the business keys) from the descriptive attributes.

Dan Linstedt, the creator of the method, describes the resulting database as follows:
{{quotation | "The Data Vault Model is a detail oriented, historical tracking and uniquely linked set of normalized tables that support one or more functional areas of business. It is a hybrid approach encompassing the best of breed between 3rd normal form (3NF) and [[star schema]]. The design is flexible, scalable, consistent and adaptable to the needs of the enterprise"&lt;ref&gt;[[#dved2|The New Business Supermodel]], glossary, page 75&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Data vault's philosophy is that all data is relevant data, even if it is not in line with established definitions and business rules. If data are not conforming to these definitions and rules then that is a problem for the business, not the data warehouse. The determination of data being "wrong" is an interpretation of the data that stems from a particular point of view that may not be valid for everyone, or at every point in time. Therefore the data vault must capture all data and only when reporting or extracting data from the data vault is the data being interpreted.

Another issue to which data vault is a response is that more and more there is a need for complete auditability and traceability of all the data in the data warehouse. Due to [[Sarbanes-Oxley]] requirements in the USA and similar measures in Europe this is a relevant topic for many business intelligence implementations, hence the focus of any data vault implementation is complete traceability and auditability of all information.

''Data Vault 2.0'' is the new specification, it is an [[open standard]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#dvos2|A short intro to#datavault 2.0]]&lt;/ref&gt; The new specification contains components which define the implementation best practices, the methodology (SEI/CMMI, Six Sigma, SDLC, etc..), the architecture, and the model. ''Data Vault 2.0'' has a focus on including new components such as Big Data, NoSQL - and also focuses on performance of the existing model. The old specification (documented here for the most part) is highly focused on data vault modeling.  It is documented in the book: Building a Scalable Data Warehouse with Data Vault 2.0.

It is necessary to evolve the specification to include the new components, along with the best practices in order to keep the EDW and BI systems current with the needs and desires of today's businesses.

=== History ===
Data vault modeling was originally conceived by Dan Linstedt in 1990 and was released in 2000 as a public domain modeling method. In a series of five articles on The Data Administration Newsletter the basic rules of the Data Vault method are expanded and explained. These contain a general overview,&lt;ref&gt;[[#tdan1|Data Vault Series 1 – Data Vault Overview]]&lt;/ref&gt; an overview of the components,&lt;ref&gt;[[#tdan2|Data Vault Series 2 – Data Vault Components]]&lt;/ref&gt; a discussion about end dates and joins,&lt;ref&gt;[[#tdan3|Data Vault Series 3 – End Dates and Basic Joins]]&lt;/ref&gt; link tables,&lt;ref&gt;[[#tdan4|Data Vault Series 4 – Link tables]], paragraph 2.3&lt;/ref&gt; and an article on loading practices.&lt;ref name="DataVault_a"&gt;[[#tdan5|Data Vault Series 5 – Loading Practices]]&lt;/ref&gt;

An alternative (and seldom used) name for the method is "Common Foundational Integration Modelling Architecture."&lt;ref&gt;[[#dwdummy|Data Warehousing for Dummies]], page 83&lt;/ref&gt;

''Data Vault 2.0''&lt;ref&gt;[[#dvos2|A short intro to #datavault 2.0]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#dvspec2|Data Vault 2.0 Being Announced]]&lt;/ref&gt; has arrived on the scene as of 2013 and brings to the table Big Data, NoSQL, unstructured, semi-structured seamless integration, along with methodology, architecture, and implementation best practices.

=== Alternative interpretations ===
According to Dan Linstedt, the Data Model is inspired by (or patterned off) a simplistic view of neurons, dendrites, and synapses – where neurons are associated with Hubs and Hub Satellites, Links are dendrites (vectors of information), and other Links are synapses (vectors in the opposite direction). By using a data mining set of algorithms, links can be scored with confidence and strength ratings. They can be created and dropped on the fly in accordance with learning about relationships that currently don't exist. The model can be automatically morphed, adapted, and adjusted as it is used and fed new structures.&lt;ref&gt;[[#dvsuper|Super Charge your Data Warehouse]], paragraph 5.20, page 110&lt;/ref&gt;

Another view is that a data vault model provides an [[ontology]] of the Enterprise in the sense that it describes the terms in the domain of the enterprise (Hubs) and the relationships among them (Links), adding descriptive attributes (Satellites) where necessary.

Another way to think of a data vault model is as a graph model. The data vault model actually provides a "graph based" model with hubs and relationships in a relational database world. In this manner, the developer can use SQL to get at graph based relationships with sub-second responses.

== Basic notions ==

[[File:Data Vault Example.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Simple data vault model with two hubs (blue), one link (green) and four satellites (yellow)]]

Data vault attempts to solve the problem of dealing with change in the environment by separating the business keys (that do not mutate as often, because they uniquely identify a business entity) and the associations between those business keys, from the descriptive attributes of those keys.

The business keys and their associations are structural attributes, forming the skeleton of the data model. The data vault method has as one of its main axioms that real business keys only change when the business changes and are therefore the most stable elements from which to derive the structure of a historical database. If you use these keys as the backbone of a data warehouse, you can organize the rest of the data around them. This means that choosing the correct keys for the hubs is of prime importance for the stability of your model.&lt;ref&gt;[[#dvsuper|Super Charge your data warehouse]], page 61, why are business keys important&lt;/ref&gt; The keys are stored in tables with a few constraints on the structure. These key-tables are called hubs.

=== Hubs ===
Hubs contain a list of unique business keys with low propensity to change. Hubs also contain a surrogate key for each Hub item and metadata describing the origin of the business key. The descriptive attributes for the information on the Hub (such as the description for the key, possibly in multiple languages) are stored in structures called Satellite tables which will be discussed below.

The Hub contains at least the following fields:&lt;ref name="DataVault"&gt;[[#dvforum1|Data Vault Forum, Standards section]], section 3.0 Hub Rules&lt;/ref&gt; 
* a surrogate key, used to connect the other structures to this table. 
* a business key, the driver for this hub. The business key can consist of multiple fields.
* the record source, which can be used to see what system loaded each business key first.
* optionally, you can also have metadata fields with information about manual updates (user/time) and the extraction date.

A hub is not allowed to contain multiple business keys, except when two systems deliver the same business key but with collisions that have different meanings.

Hubs should normally have at least one satellite.&lt;ref name="DataVault" /&gt;

==== Hub example ====
This is an example for a hub-table containing cars, called "Car" (H_CAR). The driving key is [[vehicle identification number]].

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Fieldname !! Description !! Mandatory? || Comment
|-
| H_CAR_ID || Sequence ID and surrogate key for the hub || No || Recommended but optional&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;[[#dvrules1|Data Vault Modeling Specification v1.0.9]]&lt;/ref&gt;
|-
| VEHICLE_ID_NR || The business key that drives this hub. Can be more than one field for a composite business key || Yes
|-
| H_RSRC || The recordsource of this key when first loaded || Yes
|-
| LOAD_AUDIT_ID || An ID into a table with audit information, such as load time, duration of load, number of lines, etc. || No
|}

=== Links ===
Associations or transactions between business keys (relating for instance the hubs for customer and product with each other through the purchase transaction) are modeled using link tables. These tables are basically many-to-many join tables, with some metadata.

Links can link to other links, to deal with changes in granularity (for instance, adding a new key to a database table would change the grain of the database table). For instance, if you have an association between customer and address, you could add a reference to a link between the hubs for product and transport company. This could be a link called "Delivery". Referencing a link in another link is considered a bad practice, because it introduces dependencies between links that make parallel loading more difficult. Since a link to another link is the same as a new link with the hubs from the other link, in these cases creating the links without referencing other links is the preferred solution (see the section on loading practices for more information).

Links sometimes link hubs to information that is not by itself enough to construct a hub. This occurs when one of the business keys associated by the link is not a real business key. As an example, take an order form with "order number" as key, and order lines that are keyed with a semi-random number to make them unique. Let's say, "unique number". The latter key is not a real business key, so it is no hub. However, we do need to use it in order to guarantee the correct granularity for the link. In this case, we do not use a hub with surrogate key, but add the business key "unique number" itself to the link. This is done only when there is no possibility of ever using the business key for another link or as key for attributes in a satellite. This construct has been called a 'peg-legged link' by Dan Linstedt on his (now defunct) forum.

Links contain the surrogate keys for the hubs that are linked, their own surrogate key for the link and metadata describing the origin of the association. The descriptive attributes for the information on the association (such as the time, price or amount) are stored in structures called ''satellite tables'' which are discussed below.

==== Link example ====
This is an example for a link-table between two hubs for cars (H_CAR) and persons (H_PERSON). The link is called "Driver" (L_DRIVER).

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Fieldname !! Description !! Mandatory? !! Comment
|-
| L_DRIVER_ID || Sequence ID and surrogate key for the Link || No  || Recommended but optional&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;
|-
| H_CAR_ID || surrogate key for the car hub, the first anchor of the link || Yes ||
|-
| H_PERSON_ID || surrogate key for the person hub, the second anchor of the link || Yes ||
|-
| L_RSRC || The recordsource of this association when first loaded || Yes ||
|-
| LOAD_AUDIT_ID || An ID into a table with audit information, such as load time, duration of load, number of lines, etc. || No ||
|}

=== Satellites ===
The hubs and links form the structure of the model, but have no temporal attributes and hold no descriptive attributes. These are stored in separate tables called ''satellites''. These consist of metadata linking them to their parent hub or link, metadata describing the origin of the association and attributes, as well as a timeline with start and end dates for the attribute. Where the hubs and links provide the structure of the model, the satellites provide the "meat" of the model, the context for the business processes that are captured in hubs and links. These attributes are stored both with regards to the details of the matter as well as the timeline and can range from quite complex (all of the fields describing a clients complete profile) to quite simple (a satellite on a link with only a valid-indicator and a timeline).

Usually the attributes are grouped in satellites by source system. However, descriptive attributes such as size, cost, speed, amount or color can change at different rates, so you can also split these attributes up in different satellites based on their rate of change.

All the tables contain metadata, minimally describing at least the source system and the date on which this entry became valid, giving a complete historical view of the data as it enters the data warehouse.

==== Satellite example ====
This is an example for a satellite on the drivers-link between the hubs for cars and persons, called "Driver insurance" (S_DRIVER_INSURANCE). This satellite contains attributes that are specific to the insurance of the relationship between the car and the person driving it, for instance an indicator whether this is the primary driver, the name of the insurance company for this car and person (could also be a separate hub) and a summary of the number of accidents involving this combination of vehicle and driver. Also included is a reference to a lookup- or reference table called R_RISK_CATEGORY containing the codes for the risk category in which this relationship is deemed to fall.

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Fieldname !! Description !! Mandatory? || Comment
|-
| S_DRIVER_INSURANCE_ID || Sequence ID and surrogate key for the satellite on the link || No || Recommended but optional&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;
|-
| L_DRIVER_ID || (surrogate) primary key for the driver link, the parent of the satellite || Yes
|-
|-
| S_SEQ_NR || Ordering or sequence number, to enforce uniqueness if there are several valid satellites for one parent key || No(**) || This can happen if, for instance, you have a hub COURSE and the name of the course is an attribute but in several different languages. 
|-
| S_LDTS || Load Date (startdate) for the validity of this combination of attribute values for parent key L_DRIVER_ID || Yes
|-
| S_LEDTS || Load End Date (enddate) for the validity of this combination of attribute values for parent key L_DRIVER_ID || No
|-
| IND_PRIMARY_DRIVER || Indicator whether the driver is the primary driver for this car || No (*)
|-
| INSURANCE_COMPANY || The name of the insurance company for this vehicle and this driver || No (*)
|-
| NR_OF_ACCIDENTS || The number of accidents by this driver in this vehicle || No (*)
|-
| R_RISK_CATEGORY_CD || The risk category for the driver. This is a reference to R_RISK_CATEGORY || No (*)
|-
| S_RSRC || The recordsource of the information in this satellite when first loaded || Yes
|-
| LOAD_AUDIT_ID || An ID into a table with audit information, such as load time, duration of load, number of lines, etc. || No
|}

(*) at least one attribute is mandatory.
(**) sequence number becomes mandatory if it is needed to enforce uniqueness for multiple valid satellites on the same hub or link.

=== Reference tables ===
Reference tables are a normal part of a healthy data vault model. They are there to prevent redundant storage of simple reference data that is referenced a lot. More formally, Dan Linstedt defines reference data as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;''Any information deemed necessary to resolve descriptions from codes, or to translate keys in to (sic) a consistent manner. Many of these fields are "descriptive" in nature and &lt;strong&gt;describe&lt;/strong&gt; a specific state of the other more important information. As such, reference data lives in separate tables from the raw Data Vault tables''.&lt;ref&gt;[[#dvsuper|Super Charge your Data Warehouse]], paragraph 8.0, page 146&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Reference tables are referenced from Satellites, but never bound with physical foreign keys. There is no prescribed structure for reference tables: use what works best in your specific case, ranging from simple lookup tables to small data vaults or even stars. They can be historical or have no history, but it is recommended that you stick to the natural keys and not create surrogate keys in that case.&lt;ref&gt;[[#dvsuper|Super Charge your Data Warehouse]], paragraph 8.0, page 149&lt;/ref&gt; Normally, data vaults have a lot of reference tables, just like any other Data Warehouse.

==== Reference example ====
This is an example of a reference table with risk categories for drivers of vehicles. It can be referenced from any satellite in the data vault. For now we reference it from satellite S_DRIVER_INSURANCE. The reference table is R_RISK_CATEGORY.

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Fieldname !! Description !! Mandatory?
|-
| R_RISK_CATEGORY_CD || The code for the risk category || Yes
|-
| RISK_CATEGORY_DESC || A description of the risk category || No (*)
|}

(*) at least one attribute is mandatory.

== Loading practices ==

The [[Extract,_transform,_load|ETL]] for updating a data vault model is fairly straightforward (see [[#tdan5|Data Vault Series 5 – Loading Practices]]). First you have to load all the hubs, creating surrogate IDs for any new business keys. Having done that, you can now resolve all business keys to surrogate ID's if you query the hub. The second step is to resolve the links between hubs and create surrogate IDs for any new associations. At the same time, you can also create all satellites that are attached to hubs, since you can resolve the key to a surrogate ID. Once you have created all the new links with their surrogate keys, you can add the satellites to all the links.

Since the hubs are not joined to each other except through links, you can load all the hubs in parallel. Since links are not attached directly to each other, you can load all the links in parallel as well. Since satellites can be attached only to hubs and links, you can also load these in parallel.

The ETL is quite straightforward and lends itself to easy automation or templating. Problems occur only with links relating to other links, because resolving the business keys in the link only leads to another link that has to be resolved as well. Due to the equivalence of this situation with a link to multiple hubs, this difficulty can be avoided by remodeling such cases and this is in fact the recommended practice.&lt;ref name="DataVault_a" /&gt;

Data are never deleted from the data vault, unless you have a technical error while loading data.

== Data vault and dimensional modelling ==

The data vault modelled layer is normally used to store data. It is not optimized for query performance, nor is it easy to query by the well-known query-tools such as [[Cognos]], [[SAP Business Objects]], [[Pentaho]] et al.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} Since these end-user computing tools expect or prefer their data to be contained in a dimensional model, a conversion is usually necessary.

For this purpose, the hubs and related satellites on those hubs can be considered as dimensions and the links and related satellites on those links can be viewed as fact tables in a dimensional model. This enables you to quickly prototype a dimensional model out of a data vault model using views. For performance reasons the dimensional model will usually be implemented in relational tables, after approval.

Note that while it is relatively straightforward to move data from a data vault model to a (cleansed) dimensional model, the reverse is not as easy, given the denormalized nature of the dimensional model's fact tables, fundamentally different to the third normal form of the data vault.

== Data vault methodology ==

The data vault methodology is based on SEI/CMMI Level 5 best practices. It includes multiple components of CMMI Level 5, and combines them with best practices from [[Six Sigma]], [[Total quality management|TQM]], and SDLC. Particularly, it is focused on Scott Ambler's agile methodology for build out and deployment. Data vault projects have a short, scope-controlled release cycle and should consist of a production release every 2 to 3 weeks.

Teams using the data vault methodology should readily adapt to the repeatable, consistent, and measurable projects that are expected at CMMI Level 5. Data that flow through the EDW data vault system will begin to follow the TQM (total quality management) life-cycle that has long been missing from BI (business intelligence) projects.

'''David Milwyn Duggan''' (May 5, 1879 – May 4, 1942) was a Welsh-born Canadian politician who was the [[Mayor of Edmonton]] from 1920 to 1923, a member of the [[Legislative Assembly of Alberta]], and a leader of the [[Progressive Conservative Association of Alberta|Conservative Party of Alberta]].

==Early life==

David Duggan was born in [[Builth]], [[Wales]] May 5, 1879.  In 1893 he entered the dry goods business, in which he would remain until leaving Wales.  In 1902 he married Marian Price; the pair would have four children.

Duggan immigrated to Canada in 1905 to farm near [[Nanton, Alberta]].  He moved to Edmonton in 1912 and founded Duggan Investments, Ltd., a firm handling bonds and investments.

==Municipal politics==

Duggan ran for mayor in the [[Edmonton municipal election, 1920|1920 Edmonton election]] when, despite lacking any previous experience, he defeated incumbent [[Joseph Clarke (Canadian politician)|Joseph Clarke]].  Clarke had become unpopular with the city's Board of Trade and both of its newspapers owing to what they perceived as anti-business policies, and these groups supported Duggan aggressively.  While Duggan was mayor, Alberta's first radio station, [[CJCA]], began operations, and Duggan himself concluded its inaugural broadcast by boasting "Edmonton leads the way in all Alberta. Calgary and others follow. That is all. Goodnight."  He was re-elected in [[Edmonton municipal election, 1921|1921]] and [[Edmonton municipal election, 1922|1922]], but did not seek re-election after his last term expired.

==Provincial politics==

His attentions turned to provincial politics, and he was elected to the [[Legislative Assembly of Alberta]] in the [[Alberta general election, 1926|1926 election]] as a [[Progressive Conservative Association of Alberta|Conservative]] in the riding of [[Edmonton (provincial electoral district)|Edmonton]].  Duggan succeeded [[Alexander McGillivray (Alberta politician)|Alexander McGillivray]] as leader in 1930, and led the party into [[Alberta general election, 1930|that year's election]].  In this election, the Conservatives picked up a seat in Edmonton (taking three of the city's six seats), but were shut out of seats outside of Edmonton and [[Calgary (provincial electoral district)|Calgary]], as they had been in 1926.  Moreover, they lost ground to the rival [[Alberta Liberal Party]] in the race to form the official opposition to the governing [[United Farmers of Alberta]].  Duggan easily retained his own seat.

The situation worsened for the Conservatives in the [[Alberta general election, 1935|1935 election]], when the [[Social Credit Party of Alberta]] swept the province, reducing the Conservatives to two members, Duggan and Calgary [[Member of the Legislative Assembly|MLA]] [[John Irwin (politician)|John Irwin]] (the other parties fared no better - the Liberals lost six of the eleven seats they had won in 1930, while the UFA, owners of a majority government before the writ was dropped, were eliminated from the legislature completely).  In response to this catastrophe, Duggan's Conservatives formed an alliance with the Liberals, the Unity League, whereby candidates of the parties would not run against each other, these were identified as Independents on election results as the Unity League did not have official party status.  In the [[Alberta general election, 1940|1940 election]], there were nineteen independents elected, including Duggan.

During his last full term in the legislature, Duggan was involved in the [[Bankers' Toadies incident]].  He brought to the house's attention a government-sponsored leaflet that named him and eight other men ([[William Antrobus Griesbach]] among them) as "Banker's Toadies" and urged readers to "exterminate them".  This incident saw two men, including Social Credit MLA [[Joseph Unwin]], prosecuted for criminal [[libel]] and counselling murder.

==Personal life, death, and legacy==

Duggan was active with the [[Baptist]] Church, the [[Rotary International|Rotary Club]], the Edmonton Chamber of Commerce, and the [[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement|Red Cross]].  He died May 4, 1942 while still an MLA. He was buried in Mt. Pleasant Cemetery in Edmonton.

In 2004, [[Edmonton City Council]] passed a motion directing its Names Advisory Committee to strike a subcommittee whose purpose would be, among other things, to honour Duggan by naming a city feature after him.

''' Event management''' is the application of [[project management]] to the creation and development of large-scale events such as [[festival]]s, conferences, ceremonies, weddings, formal parties, concerts, or [[convention (meeting)|conventions]]. It involves studying the brand, identifying its [[target audience]], devising the event concept, and coordinating the technical aspects before actually launching the event.&lt;ref&gt;Ramsborg, G.C.; B Miller, D Breiter, BJ Reed &amp; A Rushing (eds), ''Professional meeting management: Comprehensive strategies for meetings, conventions and events'', 2008, 5th ed, Kendall/Hunt Publishing, Dubuque, Iowa. {{ISBN|0-7575-5212-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The process of planning and coordinating the event is usually referred to as '''event planning''' and which can include budgeting, scheduling, site selection, acquiring necessary [[License|permit]]s, coordinating transportation and parking, arranging for speakers or entertainers, arranging decor, event security, [[catering]], coordinating with third party vendors, and emergency plans. Each event is different in its nature so process of planning &amp; execution of each event differs on basis of type of event. 

The events industry now includes events of all sizes from the [[Olympics]] down to business breakfast meetings. Many industries, [[charitable organization]]s, and interest groups hold events in order to market themselves, build business relationships, raise money, or celebrate achievement.

==Marketing tool==

Event management might be a tool for [[Marketing strategy|strategic marketing]] and communication, used by companies of every size. Companies can benefit from promotional events as a way to communicate with current and potential customers.  For instance, these advertising-focused events can occur as press conferences, promotional events, or product launches.

Event managers may also use traditional news media in order to target their audience, hoping to generate media coverage which will reach thousands or millions of people. They can also invite their audience to their events and reach them at the actual event.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

==Event manager==

The '''event manager''' is the person who plans and executes the event, taking responsibility for the creative, technical, and logistical elements.  This includes overall event design, brand building, marketing and communication strategy, [[audio-visual]] production, script writing, logistics, budgeting, negotiation, and client service.

==Event venue==
An event venue may be an onsite or offsite location. The event manager is usually not responsible for operations at rented event or entertainment venues, but will monitor all aspects of the event on site. Some of the tasks listed in the introduction may pass to the venue, but usually at a cost.

Corporate event managers book event venues to host corporate meetings, conferences, networking events, trade shows, product launches, team building retreats or training sessions in a more tailored environment.

== Sustainability ==
[[Sustainable event management]] (also known as event greening) is the process used to produce an event with particular concern for environmental, economic, and social issues.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.iso.org/iso/home/standards/management-standards/iso20121.htm ISO 20121 - Sustainable events]", ISO (www.iso.org), retrieved 2014-30-05&lt;/ref&gt; Sustainability in event management incorporates socially and environmentally responsible decision making into the planning, organization and implementation of, and participation in, an event. It involves including sustainable development principles and practices in all levels of event organization, and aims to ensure that an event is hosted responsibly. It represents the total package of interventions at an event, and needs to be done in an integrated manner. Event greening should start at the inception of the project, and should involve all the key role players, such as clients, organizers, venues, sub-contractors, and suppliers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wwf.panda.org/get_involved/live_green/at_the_office/green_events/|title=Organizing a Green Event|publisher=[[World Wide Fund for Nature|WWF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Technology ==

[[Event management software]] companies provide [[event planning|event planners]] with software tools to handle many common activities such as delegate registration, hotel booking, travel booking, or allocation of exhibition floorspace.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

A recent trend in event technology is the use of mobile apps for events. Event mobile apps have a range of uses. They can be used to hold relatively static information such as the agenda, speaker biographies, and general FAQs. They can also encourage audience participation and engagement through interactive tools such as live voting/polling, submitting questions to speakers during Q&amp;A, or building live interactive "word clouds". Mobile event apps can also be used by event organisers as a means of communication. Organisers can communicate with participants through the use of alerts, notifications, and push messages. They can also be used to collect feedback from the participants through the use of surveys in app. Going a step further, some mobile event apps can also help participants to engage with each other, with sponsors, and with the organisers with built-in networking functionality.

==Education==
There are an increasing number of [[universities]] which offer courses in event management, including diplomas and graduate degrees. In addition to these academic courses, there are many associations and societies that provide courses on the various aspects of the [[industry]]. Study includes organizational skills, technical knowledge, [[public relations]], [[marketing]], [[advertising]], [[catering]], [[logistics]], [[Interior design|decor]], glamor identity, human relations, study of law and licenses, risk management, budgeting, and the study of allied industries like television, other media, and several other areas. Certification can be acquired from various sources to obtain designations such as 
*Certified Trade Show Marketer (CTSM)
*Certified in Exhibition Management (CEM)
*Global Certification in Meeting Management (CMM)
*[[Certified Meeting Professional]] (CMP)
*Global Certificate in Event Design (EDC) 
*Certified Special Event Professional (CSEP) 
*Certified Quality Event Planner (CQEP)

The '''Executive [[MBA]] Council''' is an [[educational accreditation]] council formed in 1981 to accredit [[business school|schools of business]] offering EMBA degrees worldwide. The council was formed with the assistance of the [[Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business]] (AACSB International).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.emba.org/about_member_list.html EMBA Council Members]&lt;/ref&gt;

The council's stated [[Mission statement|mission]] is to promote the advancement of executive MBA worldwide through its partnerships, conference, and research and outreach activities.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.efmd.org/index.php/blog/view/219-executive-mba-council-reports-on-key-trends EFMD] EFMD Executive MBA Council Reports on Key Trends, Retrieved April 14, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; The EMBA Council is governed by a Board of Trustees, which consists mainly of the Deans or Program Directors of its business school members and sets goals on council initiatives.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.emba.org/about_whoweare_board.htm Executive Council Board of Trustees]&lt;/ref&gt;

The council is headquartered in Beckman Hall, [[Orange, California|Orange]], [[California]], [[United States]].

As of May 2010, the Executive MBA Council has accredited 237 full business schools on six continents and 18 corporate members.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

'''Export hay''' is [[hay]] that is produced for export markets. In [[Australia]], hay needs to meet a number of quality standards before it can be exported. Because hay in standard round and large square bales is not dense enough to be economically exported to overseas markets, export hay is normally processed to increase the density of the product and improve its suitability for [[containerization]]. This form of processing was pioneered by [[ACX Pacific Northwest]], and is often referred to as double compression.{{fact|date=March 2015}} This process allows forage and roughage exporters to inspect and package the hay prior to shipping. 

In Australia, [[Oat]]en hay is the most common type of export hay. [[Alfalfa]] (also known as lucerne in Australia) is also grown for export hay, often under irrigation, and is the most common type of export hay in the U.S.

{{refimprove|date=May 2014}}
{{Capitalism|Concepts}}
A '''free price system''' or '''free price mechanism''' (informally called ''the price system'' or ''the price mechanism'') is a mechanism of resource allocation that relies upon [[Money|monetary prices]] set by the interchange of [[supply and demand]]. The resulting prices serve as ''[[price signal|signal]]s'' communicated between producers and consumers which serve to guide the production and distribution of resources. Through the free price system, supplies are rationed, income is distributed, and resources are allocated. 

A free price system contrasts with a [[Administered price|fixed price system]] where prices are administered by [[government]] in a [[controlled market]]. The price system, whether ''free'' or controlled, contrasts with physical and non-monetary [[economic planning]].

==Mechanics of a free price system==
[[Image:PriceFreedom.svg|thumb|left|300px|A diagram presenting the argument for free prices]]
Rather than prices being set by the state, as in a [[command economy]] with a ''fixed price system'', prices are determined in a decentralized fashion by trades that occur as a result of sellers' ''asking prices'' matching buyers' ''bid prices'' as a result of [[subjective theory of value|subjective value judgement]] in a [[market economy]]. Since resources of consumers are limited at any given time, consumers are relegated to satisfying wants in a descending hierarchy and bidding prices relative to the urgency of a variety of wants. This information on relative values is communicated, through ''[[price signal]]s'', to producers whose resources are also limited. In turn, relative prices for the productive services are established. The interchange of these two sets of prices establish market value, and serve to guide the rationing of resources, distributing income, and allocating resources.

Those goods which command the highest prices (when summed among all individuals) provide an incentive for businesses to provide these goods in a corresponding descending hierarchy of priority. However, the ordering of this hierarchy of wants is not constant. Consumer preferences change. When consumer preferences for a good increase, then bidding pressure raises the price for a particular good as it moves to a higher position in the hierarchy. As a result of higher prices for this good, more productive forces are applied to satisfying the demand driven by the opportunity for higher profits in satisfying this new consumer preference. In other words, the high price sends a ''price signal'' to producers. This causes producers to increase supply, either by the same firms increasing production or new businesses coming into the market, which eventually lowers the price and the profit incentive to increase supplies. Hence, the now lower price provides a price signal to producers to decrease production and, as a result, a surplus is prevented. Since resources are scarce (including labor and capital), supplies of other goods will be diminished as the productive resources are taken from other areas of production to be applied toward increasing output of the good that has risen in the hierarchy of consumer preferences. Also, as resources become more scarce the price increases, which signals to consumers to reduce consumption thereby ensuring that the quantity demanded does not exceed the quantity supplied. It is in this way that the free price system persuades consumers to ration dwindling resources. Hence, supply and demand affect price, while at the same time price affects supply and demand. If prices remain high because increases in supply cannot keep pace with demand, then this also signals other business to provide substitute goods in order to take advantage of profit opportunities.

Individual employments and incomes are also guided by the price system. Employment will move toward those goods and services that consumers value and away from those with declining importance to consumers as a result of changes in prices.

{{Unreferenced|date=July 2009}}

A '''general union''' is a [[trade union]] (called ''[[labor union]]'' in [[American English]]) which represents [[worker]]s from all industries and companies, rather than just one organisation or a particular sector, as in a [[craft union]] or [[industrial union]]. A general union differs from a [[union federation]] or [[trades council]] in that its members are individuals, not unions. The creation of general unions, from the early nineteenth century in the United Kingdom and somewhat later elsewhere, occurred around the same time as efforts began to unionise workers in new industries, in particular those where employment could be irregular.

Proponents of general unions claim that their broader range of members allows more opportunities for [[solidarity action]] and better coordination in [[general strike]]s and the like. Detractors claim that the broader remit means they tend to be more [[bureaucracy|bureaucratic]] and respond less effectively to events in a single industry.

In the United Kingdom, general unions include the [[GMB (trade union)|GMB]] and the [[Transport and General Workers' Union]]. In Australia a good example of a general union is the [[Australian Workers' Union]].

'''George Oliver May''' (May 22, 1875 – May 25, 1961) was a British American accountant. He led a joint study by the [[American Institute of Certified Public Accountants]] and the [[New York Stock Exchange]] that was impetus for the stock exchange requiring its listed firms to undergo independent annual audits.  The study also is credited for causing the new [[Securities and Exchange Commission]] to allow the accounting profession to define accounting principles, rather than taking on that responsibility itself.

He rose to senior partnership in Price Waterhouse &amp; Co. and wrote more than 100 articles in professional journals.

In 1941 he was elected as a [[Fellow of the American Statistical Association]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amstat.org/awards/fellowslist.cfm View/Search Fellows of the ASA], accessed 2016-07-23.&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1944, he received the AICPA's Gold Medal Award.
In 1950, he was named with two others to the [[Accounting Hall of Fame]], in its first year.

Lynn Turner, chief accountant of the SEC credits George O. May with contributing to the development of stronger authorities on accounting, noting in 1952 that May commented "'accounting income was on its way to becoming a political, not an economic concept'".[https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/spch428.htm]

'''John L. Gokongwei Jr.''' ({{zh|t=吳奕輝|s=吴奕辉|p=Wú Yìhuī|poj=Gô͘ E̍k-hui|first=t}}; is a Filipino business magnate, investor, and philanthropist. He has holdings in telecommunications, financial services, petrochemicals, power generation, aviation, food, beverage, and livestock farming.

==Early life ==
John Gokongwei Jr. was born in China to a Filipino-Chinese father who was a scion of a wealthy [[Cebu Province|Cebu]]-based family, with ancestral ties to China's [[Fujian]] province. His great grandfather was Pedro Gotiaco, a young peddler from China who became one of the Philippine's most prominent Filipino-Chinese&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gokongwei|first=Lisa and Lance|date=August 2001|title=Mr. John's Life and Times|url=|journal=I Did It My Wei|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The family fortune was lost when his affluent father died. John was 13 years old at this time. He initially supported his family by peddling items along the streets of [[Cebu]] from his bicycle.&lt;ref name=speech&gt;{{cite web|title=Speech delivered last March 1, 2002 during the launch of the Ateneo de Manila University John Gokongwei School of Management|url=http://www.jgsummit.com.ph/speech-jgkw-ateneo-som-20020301.html|publisher=JG Summit Holdings Inc webpage|accessdate=6 January 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140404224017/http://www.jgsummit.com.ph/speech-jgkw-ateneo-som-20020301.html|archivedate=4 April 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the age of 17 to 19, he traded using a wooden boat, taking items to [[Dalahican, Lucena]] by sea, and then to [[Manila]] by truck.

==Business career==
===Early career===
After the [[Second World War]], he started his own company called Amasia Trading, which imported flour, onions, fruits, used clothing, old newspapers and magazines from the United States. During this time, he courted a young girl, Elizabeth, who would later become his wife. In the early 1950s, along with his brothers and sisters who returned from China, he started to import cigarettes and whiskey too.

In 1957, seeing that trading would always have low margins&lt;ref name=speech/&gt; and would always be dependent on government policies, the family concern entered the era of manufacturing. With a loan of 500 thousand pesos from [[Washington SyCip|Albino Sycip]], then chairman of [[China Bank]], and DK Chiong, he started a corn milling plant producing glucose and corn starch. The company was named Universal Corn Products and later expanded into [[Universal Robina|Universal Robina Corporation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Our History|url=http://www2.urc.com.ph/company_history.html|publisher=Universal Robina corporation|accessdate=6 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[San Miguel Corporation]] was a big customer of theirs.

In 1961, as his company started to launch brands such as Blend 45 (an instant coffee brand, to compete with [[Nestle]]'s [[Nescafe]]), John returned to school to study and obtain an [[MBA]] at the [[De La Salle University]]. A decade later, he underwent a 14-week advanced management program at [[Harvard]].&lt;ref name=speech/&gt;

===Later career===
He is the chairman of [[JG Summit Holdings]], one of the largest conglomerates in the Philippines. In 2010, his company signed a $3 billion order with Airbus for re-fleeting of his airline, [[Cebu Pacific Air]]. From 2003  his telecom company [[Digital Telecommunications Philippines]] spent nearly $800 million for its mobile carrier, [[Sun Cellular]] which is the 3rd largest mobile operator in the Philippines at that time before selling to the PLDT group for $1.7 billion. He attempted a $1 billion takeover of [[United Industrial Corporation Ltd]] (UIC), a property giant from Singapore of which he owned in excess of 30%. UIC controls [[Singapore Land]], one of the biggest property landlords in Singapore.

In 2013, his company bought the stake of San Miguel Corporation in MERALCO, the largest power distributor in the country, for close to $1.8 billion.

Gokongwei also owns [[Universal Robina Corporation]], one of the largest manufacturer of snacks in Southeast Asia. In July 2014, URC acquired [[Griffin's Foods]] from [[Pacific Equity Partners]], a New Zealand food company for $609 million.

He also controls [[Robinsons Malls|Robinsons]] Land, one of the biggest property developers in the Philippines, which also operates  a chain of [[Robinsons Malls|malls]]. The Gokongwei Family controls over $20 billion of combined market capitalization for all the companies they own.

In February 2008, [[Forbes]] Asia magazine’s first Heroes of [[Philanthropy]] list included 4 Filipinos – [[Jaime Zobel de Ayala]], John Gokongwei, Ramón del Rosario Jr., and Óscar López.The list is composed of 4 philanthropists each from 13 selected countries and territories in Asia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/storypage.aspx?StoryId=110683 www.abs-cbnnews.com, 4 Filipinos in New Forbes Heroes List]{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publications==
On August 29, 2007, at the [[Ateneo de Manila University]], Gokongwei’s  biography, ''John L. Gokongwei Jr.: The Path of Entrepreneurship'', by the University’s Dr. Marites A. Khanser,  was launched,  and it narrated the "riches-to-rags-to-riches" story of the [[tai-pan]]. Gokongwei stated that [[entrepreneurship]] is a way out of [[poverty]]. Khanser's book also enumerated the Nine Rules of business success&lt;ref&gt;[http://mightyrasing.com/nine-rules-of-business-success-of-john-gokongwei-jr/ Gokongwei's Nine Rules of Business Success] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131109041845/http://mightyrasing.com/nine-rules-of-business-success-of-john-gokongwei-jr/ |date=2013-11-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; that Gokongwei followed since he was still a young businessman. In 2002 Gokongwei donated P200-million to the undergraduate school of management. He also gave donations to [[University of San Carlos]], [[Xavier School]], [[De La Salle University]], Sacred Heart School and Immaculate Conception Academy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://business.inquirer.net/money/breakingnews/view_article.php?article_id=86043 Inquirer.net,  A way out of poverty, according to ‘Mr. John’] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070904053256/http://business.inquirer.net/money/breakingnews/view_article.php?article_id=86043 |date=2007-09-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
He is married to Elizabeth Yu, and has six children (1 son and 5 daughters) - Lisa, Robina, Lance, Faith, Hope and Marcia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Gonzalez|first=Bianca|title=Publishing mogul Lisa Gokongwei-Cheng’s dream: To own a tiny bookstore|url=http://www.philstar.com/sunday-life/2013/09/01/1156041/publishing-mogul-lisa-gokongwei-chengs-dream-own-tiny-bookstore|accessdate=6 January 2014|newspaper=The Philippine Star|date=1 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; All his children play an active role in the Gokongwei empire and companies owned by [[Robinson Group|JG Holdings]]. His only son, [[Lance Gokongwei]], is now in charge of the Gokongwei Empire, serving as president and CEO while John serves as the Chairman Emeritus.

'''Labour law''' (also known as '''labor law''' or '''employment law''') mediates the relationship between workers, employing entities, [[trade union]]s and the government. Collective labour law relates to the tripartite relationship between [[employee]], [[employer]] and union. Individual labour law concerns employees' rights at work and through the [[contract]] for work. {{Visible anchor|Employment standards}} are social norms (in some cases also technical [[standardization|standards]]) for the minimum socially acceptable conditions under which employees or contractors are allowed to work. Government agencies (such as the former US [[Employment Standards Administration]]) enforce labour law (legislative, regulatory, or judicial).

==History==
{{main|History of labour law}}
Labour law arose in parallel with the [[Industrial Revolution]] as the relationship between worker and employer changed from small-scale production studios to large-scale factories. Workers sought better conditions and the right to join (or avoid joining) a [[labour union]], while employers sought a more predictable, flexible and less costly workforce. The state of labour law at any one time is therefore both the product of, and a component of struggles between various social forces.

As England was the first country to industrialise, it was also the first to face the often appalling consequences of industrial revolution in a less regulated economic framework. Over the course of the late 18th and early to mid-19th century the foundation for modern labour law was slowly laid, as some of the more egregious aspects of working conditions were steadily ameliorated through legislation. This was largely achieved through the concerted pressure from [[social reform]]ers, notably [[Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 7th Earl of Shaftesbury]], and others.

===Child labour===
A serious outbreak of fever in 1784 in [[cotton mills]] near [[Manchester]] drew widespread public opinion against the use of children in dangerous conditions. A local inquiry, presided over by Dr [[Thomas Percival]], was instituted by the [[Justice of the peace|justices of the peace]] for [[Lancashire]], and the resulting report recommended the limitation of children's working hours.&lt;ref&gt;From an " Essay on Trade " (1770), quoted in ''History of Factory Legislation,'' by [[B. Leigh Hutchins]] and [[Amy Harrison (author)|Amy Harrison]] (1903), pp. 5, 6.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1802, the first major piece of labour legislation was passed − the [[Health and Morals of Apprentices Act 1802|Health and Morals of Apprentices Act]]. This was the first, albeit modest, step towards the protection of labour. The act limited working hours to twelve a day and abolished night work. It required the provision of a basic level of education for all apprentices, as well as adequate sleeping accommodation and clothing.

The rapid industrialisation of manufacturing at the turn of the 19th century led to a rapid increase in child employment, and public opinion was steadily made aware of the terrible conditions these children were forced to endure. The [[Factory Acts#Cotton Mills, etc. Act 1819|Factory Act of 1819]] was the outcome of the efforts of the industrialist [[Robert Owen]] and prohibited [[child labour]] under nine years of age and limited the working day to twelve. A great milestone in labour law was reached with the [[Factory Acts#Labour of Children, etc., in Factories Act 1833|Factory Act of 1833]], which limited the employment of children under eighteen years of age, prohibited all night work and, crucially, provided for inspectors to enforce the law. Pivotal in the campaigning for and the securing of this legislation were [[Michael Thomas Sadler|Michael Sadler]] and the [[Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 7th Earl of Shaftesbury|Earl of Shaftesbury]]. This act was an important step forward, in that it mandated skilled inspection of workplaces and a rigorous enforcement of the law by an independent governmental body.

A lengthy campaign to limit the working day to ten hours was led by Shaftesbury, and included support from the [[Anglican Church]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=The Ten Hours' Bill |newspaper=The Times |url=http://infotrac.galegroup.com/itw/infomark/126/803/158807039w16/purl=rc1_TTDA_0_CS117603378&amp;dyn=3!xrn_5_0_CS117603378&amp;hst_1?sw_aep=mclib |date=18 January 1847 |page=7 |issue=19449 |accessdate=19 August 2011}} {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many committees were formed in support of the cause and some previously established groups lent their support as well.&lt;ref&gt;Yale University Library holds full text versions of the Ten Hours' Advocate in its microfilm department&lt;/ref&gt; The campaign finally led to the passage of the [[Factory Act 1847|Factory Act of 1847]], which restricted the working hours of women and children in British factories to effectively 10 hours per day.&lt;ref&gt;Bloy, Marjorie http://www.historyhome.co.uk/peel/factmine/factory.htm "The Factory Question" accessed 20&amp;nbsp;March 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

===Working conditions===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Colliery.jpg|thumb|left|Men leaving the [[History of coal mining|pit]], before the start of [[World War I]]. The average [[life expectancy]] of a [[Liverpool]] mineworker was 30 years in 1900.]] --&gt;
These early efforts were principally aimed at limiting child labour. From the mid-19th century, attention was first paid to the plight of [[working conditions]] for the workforce in general. In 1850, systematic reporting of fatal accidents was made compulsory, and basic safeguards for health, life and limb in the mines were put in place from 1855. Further regulations, relating to ventilation, fencing of disused shafts, signalling standards, and proper gauges and valves for steam-boilers and related machinery were also set down.

A series of further Acts, in 1860 and 1872 extended the legal provisions and strengthened safety provisions. Steady development of the coal industry, increasing association among miners, and increased scientific knowledge paved the way for the Coal Mines Act of 1872, which extended the legislation to similar industries. The same Act included the first comprehensive code of regulation to govern legal safeguards for health, life and limb. The presence of a more certified and competent management and increased levels of inspection were also provided for.

By the end of the century, a comprehensive set of regulations was in place in England that affected all industries. A similar system (with certain national differences) was implemented in other industrializing countries in the latter part of the 19th century and the early 20th century.

==Individual labour law==

===Employment terms===
{{Main|Employment contract|At-will employment}}
The basic feature of labour law in almost every country is that the rights and obligations of the worker and the employer are mediated through a [[contract of employment]] between the two. This has been the case since the collapse of [[feudalism]]. Many contract terms and conditions are covered by [[legislation]] or [[common law]]. In the US for example, the majority of [[State law (United States)|state laws]] allow for [[At-will employment|employment to be "at will"]], meaning the employer can terminate an employee from a position for any reason, so long as the reason is not explicitly prohibited,{{efn|For example, an employee's refusal to violate law or an employee's assertion of rights.}} and, conversely, an employee may quit at any time, for any reason (or for no reason), and is not required to give notice.

One example of employment terms in many countries&lt;ref&gt;e.g. In the European Union, Directive 91/533&lt;/ref&gt; is the duty to provide written particulars of employment with the ''[[essentialia negotii]]'' ([[Latin]] for "essential terms") to an employee. This aims to allow the employee to know concretely what to expect and what is expected. It covers items including [[Compensation and benefits|compensation]], [[Annual leave|holiday]] and [[sick leave|illness rights]], notice in the [[Termination of employment|event of dismissal]] and [[job description]].

The contract is subject to various legal provisions. An employer may not legally offer a contract that pays the worker less than a minimum wage. An employee may not agree to a contract that allows an employer to [[Wrongful dismissal|dismiss them for illegal reasons]].{{efn|In the US, under the [[National Labor Relations Act]], a worker has no right to organize where he is considered a manager, see ''NLRB v. Kentucky River Community Care'', [http://www.lawmemo.com/nlrb/kyrivercases.htm 532 U.S. 706] (2001)}}

===Minimum wage===
{{Main|Minimum wage}}
Many jurisdictions define the minimum amount that a worker can be paid per hour. Algeria, Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Greece, Hungary, India, Ireland, Japan,South Korea, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Paraguay, Portugal, Poland, Romania, Spain,Taiwan, the United Kingdom, the United States, Vietnam, Germany (in 2015&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Minimum Wage Act in Germany with effect from 01-01-2015|url=http://www.mayer-kuegler.de/#!minimum-wages-law-germany/mov20|website=Dr. Mayer &amp; Kügler Rechtsanwälte PartG mbB - Arbeitsrecht|publisher=Lawyer Michael Kügler|accessdate=27 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and others have laws of this kind.{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}} The minimum wage is set usually higher than the lowest wage as determined by the forces of [[supply and demand]] in a [[free market]] and therefore acts as a [[price floor]]. Each country sets its own [[minimum wage law]]s and regulations, and while a majority of industrialized countries has a minimum wage, many developing countries do not.

Minimum wages are regulated and stipulated in some countries that lack explicit laws. In Sweden minimum wages are negotiated between the [[Labour economics|labour market]] parties (unions and employer organizations) through [[collective agreements]] that also cover non-union workers at workplaces with collective agreements. At workplaces without collective agreements there exist no minimum wages. Non-organized employers can sign substitute agreements directly with trade unions but far from all do. The Swedish case illustrates that in countries without statutory regulation will part of the labour market do not have regulated minimum wages, as self-regulation only applies to workplaces and employees covered by collective agreements (in Sweden about 90 per cent of employees).&lt;ref name="portal.research.lu.se"&gt;Anders Kjellberg (2017) [https://web.archive.org/web/20170418083350/http://portal.research.lu.se/ws/files/23904978/Kjellberg_FSNumhauserHenning_Self_Regulation_State_Regulation.pdf ”Self-regulation versus State Regulation in Swedish Industrial Relations”] In Mia Rönnmar and Jenny Julén Votinius (eds.)

===Living wage===
{{Main|Living wage}}

The living wage is higher than the minimum wage and is designed that a full-time worker would be able to support themselves and a small family at that wage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Clain, S.|year=2008|title=How Living Wage Legislation Affects U.S. Poverty Rates|journal=Journal of Labor Research|volume=29|issue=3|pages=205–218|doi=10.1007/s12122-007-9028-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hours===
{{See also|Eight-hour day}}
The maximum number of hours worked per day or other time interval are set by law in many countries. Such laws also control whether workers who work longer hours must be paid additional compensation.

Before the Industrial Revolution, the workday varied between 11 and 14 hours. With the growth of [[industrialism]] and the introduction of machinery, longer hours became far more common, reaching as high as 16 hours per day.

The [[eight-hour day|eight-hour movement]] led to the first law on the length of a working day, passed in 1833 in England. It limited miners to 12 hours and children to 8 hours. The 10-hour day was established in 1848, and shorter hours with the same pay were gradually accepted thereafter. The 1802 [[Factory Act]] was the first labour law in the UK.

Germany was the next European country to pass labour laws; Chancellor [[Otto von Bismarck]]'s main goal was to undermine the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]]. In 1878, Bismarck instituted a variety of anti-socialist measures, but despite this, socialists continued gaining seats in the [[Reichstag (German Empire)|Reichstag]]. To appease the working class, he enacted a variety of [[paternalistic]] social reforms, which became the first type of [[social security]]. In 1883 the Health Insurance Act was passed, which entitled workers to health insurance; the worker paid two-thirds and the employer one-third of the premiums. Accident insurance was provided in 1884, while old age pensions and disability insurance followed in 1889. Other laws restricted the employment of women and children. These efforts, however, were not entirely successful; the working class largely remained unreconciled with Bismarck's conservative government.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}

In France, the first labour law was voted in 1841. It limited under-age miners' hours. In the [[French Third Republic|Third Republic]] labour law was first effectively enforced, in particular after [[Waldeck-Rousseau]] 1884 law legalising [[trade unions]]. With the [[Matignon Accords (1936)|Matignon Accords]], the [[Popular Front (France)|Popular Front]] (1936–38) enacted the laws mandating 12 days each year of [[annual leave|paid vacations]] for workers and the law limiting the standard workweek to 40 hours.

===Health and safety===

{{Main|Occupational safety and health}}
Other labour laws involve safety concerning workers. The earliest English [[Factory Acts#Factory Act 1802|factory law]] was passed in 1802 and dealt with the safety and health of [[child labour|child]] [[textile]] workers.

===Discrimination===
{{Main|Anti-discrimination law}}
Such laws prohibited [[discrimination]] against employees as morally unacceptable and illegal, in particular [[racial discrimination]] or [[sexism|gender discrimination]].

===Dismissal===
{{Main|Unfair dismissal|Wrongful dismissal|At-will employment}}
[[Termination of Employment Convention, 1982|Convention no. 158]] of the [[International Labour Organization]] states that an employee "can't be fired without any legitimate motive" and "before offering him the possibility to defend himself". Thus, on April 28, 2006, after the unofficial repeal of the French [[First Employment Contract]], the [[Longjumeau]] ([[Essonne]]) ''conseil des prud'hommes'' (labour law court) judged the [[New Employment Contract]] contrary to [[international law]] and therefore "illegitimate" and "without any juridical value". The court considered that the two-years period of "fire at will" (without any legal motive) was "unreasonable", and contrary to convention.&lt;ref name="Reuters"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Un contrat en CNE jugé contraire au droit international |date=April 28, 2006 |accessdate=2006-05-05 |publisher=Reuters |url=http://today.reuters.fr/news/newsArticle.aspx?type=topNews&amp;storyID=2006-04-28T165412Z_01_TOU860781_RTRIDST_0_OFRTP-FRANCE-EMPLOI-CNE-TRIBUNAL-20060428.XML |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060524110508/http://today.reuters.fr/news/newsArticle.aspx?type=topNews&amp;storyID=2006-04-28T165412Z_01_TOU860781_RTRIDST_0_OFRTP-FRANCE-EMPLOI-CNE-TRIBUNAL-20060428.XML |dead-url=yes |archive-date=May 24, 2006 |language=fr |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title=Bernard Thibault au plus haut |date=April 28, 2006 | accessdate=2006-05-05 | work=[[L'Express (France)|L'Express]] | url=http://www.lexpress.fr/info/quotidien/actu.asp?id=3591 | archiveurl=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20091001054905/http://www.lexpress.fr/info/quotidien/actu.asp?id=3591 | archivedate=2009-10-01 |language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Child labour===
{{Main|Child labour}}
[[File:Abolish child slavery.jpg|thumb|right|Two girls wearing banners in Yiddish and English with the slogan "Abolish child slavery!!" at the 1909 [[International Workers' Day]] parade in New York City]]
Child labour was not seen as a problem throughout most of history, only disputed with the beginning of universal [[education|schooling]] and the concepts of [[labor rights|labourers']] and [[children's rights]]. Use of [[child labour]] was commonplace, often in factories. In England and Scotland in 1788, about two-thirds of persons working in water-powered [[textile]] factories were children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.galbithink.org/child.htm |title=Child Labor and the Division of Labor in the Early English Cotton Mills |publisher=Galbi Think! |date=13 June 1994 |author=Galbi, Douglas A.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Child labour can be factory work, mining or quarrying, agriculture, helping in the parents' business, operating a [[small business]] (such as selling food), or doing odd jobs. Children work as guides for [[tourism|tourists]], sometimes combined with bringing in business for shops and [[restaurant]]s (where they may also work). Other children do jobs such as assembling boxes or polishing shoes. However, rather than in factories and [[sweatshop]]s, most child labour in the twenty-first century occurs in the informal sector, "selling on the street, at work in [[agriculture]] or [[child domestic work|hidden away in houses]]&amp;nbsp;— far from the reach of official inspectors and from media scrutiny."&lt;ref name="unicef"&gt;{{cite web | title=The State of the World's Children 1997 | work=UNICEF | url=http://www.unicef.org/sowc97/report/ | accessdate=2007-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Collective labour law==
{{main|Freedom of association}}
Collective labour law concerns the relationship between employer, employee and [[trade unions]]. Trade unions (also "labor unions" in the US) are organizations which generally aim to promote the interests of their members.

===Trade unions===
{{Main|Trade union}}
Trade unions are organized groups of workers who engage in [[collective bargaining]] with employers. Some countries require unions and/or employers to follow particular procedures in pursuit of their goals. For example, some countries require that unions poll the membership to approve a strike or to approve using members' dues for political projects. Laws may govern the circumstances and procedures under which unions are formed. They may guarantee the right to join a union (banning employer discrimination), or remain silent in this respect. Some legal codes allow unions to obligate their members, such as the requirement to comply with a majority decision in a strike vote. Some restrict this, such as "[[right to work]]" legislation in parts of the United States.

In the different organization in the different countries trade union discuses with the employee on behalf of employer. At that time trade union discussed or talk with the manpower of the organization. At that time trade union perform his role like a bridge between the employee and employer.

===Workplace participation===
{{Main|Co-determination|Industrial democracy}}
A legally binding right for workers as a group to participate in workplace management is acknowledged in some form in most developed countries. In a majority of EU member states (for example, Germany, Sweden, and France) the workforce has a right to elect directors on the board of large corporations. This is usually called "codetermination" and currently most countries allow for the election of one third of the board, though the workforce can have the right to elect anywhere from a single director, to just under a half in Germany. 
However, [[German company law]] uses a split board system, in which a "supervisory board" appoints an "executive board". Under the [[Mitbestimmunggesetz 1976]], shareholders and employees elect the supervisory board in equal numbers, but the head of the supervisory board with a casting vote is a shareholder representative. The first statutes to introduce board level codetermination were in Britain, however most of these measures, except in universities, were removed in 1948 and 1979. The oldest surviving statute is found in the United States, in the Massachusetts Laws on manufacturing corporations, introduced in 1919, however this was always voluntary.

In the United Kingdom, similar proposals were drawn up, and a command paper produced named the [[Bullock Report (Industrial democracy)]] was released in 1977 by the [[James Callaghan]] [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] government. Unions would have directly elected half of the board. An "independent" element would also be added. However, the proposal was not enacted. The [[European Commission]] offered proposals for worker participation in the "fifth company law directive", which was also not implemented.

In Sweden, participation is regulated through the "Law on board representation". The law covers all private companies with 25 or more employees. In these companies, workers (usually through unions) have a right to appoint two board members and two substitutes. If the company has more than 1,000 employees, this rises to three members and three substitutes. It is common practice to allocate them among the major union coalitions.

===Information and consultation===
Workplace statutes in many countries require that employers consult their workers on various issues.

===Collective bargaining===
{{main|Collective bargaining}}

===Collective action===
{{Main|Strike action|Picketing (protest)}}
[[File:Tyldesley miners outside the Miners Hall during the 1926 General Strike.jpg|right|thumb|Strikers gathering in [[Tyldesley, Greater Manchester]] in the 1926 [[General Strike]] in the U.K.]]

[[Strike action]] is the worker tactic most associated with industrial disputes. In most countries, strikes are legal under a circumscribed set of conditions. Among them may be that:
* The strike is decided on by a prescribed democratic process ([[wildcat strikes]] are illegal).
* [[Sympathy strike]]s, against a company by which workers are not directly employed, may be prohibited.
* [[General strike]]s may be forbidden for example, among public safety workers, to maintain [[public order]].

A [[boycott]] is a refusal to buy, sell, or otherwise trade with an individual or business. Other tactics include [[go-slow]], [[sabotage]], [[work-to-rule]], [[sit-in]] or en-masse not reporting to work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.af-north.org/lordstown.html |title=The Lordstown Struggle and the Real Crisis in Production |author=Weller, Ken |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060213065526/http://www.af-north.org/lordstown.html |archivedate=February 13, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some labour law explicitly bans such activity, none explicitly allows it.

[[Picketing (protest)|Picketing]] is often used by workers during strikes. They may congregate near the business they are striking against to make their presence felt, increase worker participation and dissuade (or prevent) [[strikebreaker|strike breakers]] from entering the workplace. In many countries, this activity is restricted by law, by more general law restricting demonstrations, or by injunctions on particular pickets. For example, labour law may restrict [[Picketing (protest)|secondary picketing]] (picketing a business connected with the company not directly with the dispute, such as a supplier), or [[flying picket]]s (mobile strikers who travel to join a picket). Laws may prohibit obstructing others from conducting lawful business; outlaw obstructive pickets allow court orders to restrict picketing locations or behaving in particular ways (shouting abuse, for example).

==International labour law==
{{Clist global labour}}
{{see also|International Labour Organization|World Trade Organization|Private international law}}
The labour movement has long been concerned that economic [[globalization]] would weaken worker bargaining power, as their employers could hire workers abroad to avoid domestic labour standards. [[Karl Marx]] said:
{{quote|The extension of the principle of free trade, which induces between nations such a competition that the interest of the workman is liable to be lost sight of and sacrificed in the fierce international race between capitalists, demands that such organizations [unions] should be still further extended and made international.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/iwma/documents/1869/basle-report.htm|author=Marx, Karl|authorlink=Karl Marx|title=Report of the General Council to the Fourth Annual Congress|location=[[Basle, Switzerland]]|date=September 1869}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
The International Labour Organization and the World Trade Organization have been a primary focus among international bodies for regulating labour markets. Conflicts arise when people work in more than one country. EU law has a growing body of workplace rules.

===International Labour Organization===
{{main|International Labour Organization|ILO Conventions}}
Following [[World War One]], the [[Treaty of Versailles]] contained the first constitution of a new [[International Labour Organization]] (ILO) founded on the principle that "labour is not a commodity", and for the reason that "peace can be established only if it is based upon social justice".&lt;ref&gt;[[Treaty of Versailles]] (1919) [[s:Constitution of the International Labour Office|Part XIII]], Section I, and Article 427&lt;/ref&gt; ILO's primary role has been to coordinate international labour law by issuing Conventions. ILO members can voluntarily adopt and ratify the Conventions. For instance, the first [[Hours of Work (Industry) Convention, 1919]] required a maximum of a 48-hour week, and has been ratified by 52 out of 185 member states. The UK ultimately refused to ratify the Convention, as did many current EU members, although the [[Working Time Directive]] adopts its principles, subject to individual opt-out.{{efn|Two further general working time conventions are the [[Forty-Hour Week Convention, 1935|Forty-Hour Week Convention]] (No. 51) and the [[Holidays with Pay Convention, 1936|Holidays with Pay Convention]] (No. 52). For general information, see {{cite book|last=Ewing|first=Keith|title=Britain and the ILO|year=1994|publisher=Institute of Employment Rights|location=London|isbn=9781873271339|edition=2nd|page=16}} }} ILO's constitution comes from the 1944 [[Declaration of Philadelphia]] and under the 1998 [[Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work]] classified eight conventions{{efn|There are 189 Conventions, however some have been superseded by others. For instance, Conventions No. 2, 34, 96, and 181 all concern [[private employment agencies]], but only Convention 181 is in force.}} as core.

These require freedom to join a union, bargain collectively and take action (Conventions No. [[Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention|87]] and [[Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention|98]]), abolition of forced labour ([[Forced Labour Convention|29]] and [[Abolition of Forced Labour Convention|105]]), abolition of labour by children before the end of compulsory school ([[Minimum Age Convention, 1973|138]] and [[Worst Forms of Child Labour Convention|182]]), and no discrimination at work (No. [[Equal Remuneration Convention|100]] and [[Discrimination (Employment and Occupation) Convention|111]]). Member compliance with the core Conventions is obligatory, even if the country has not ratified the Convention in question. To ensure compliance, the ILO is limited to gathering evidence and reporting on member states' progress, relying on publicity to create pressure to reform. Global reports on core standards are produced yearly, while individual reports on countries who have ratified other Conventions are compiled on a bi-annual or less frequent basis.

[[File:Wto logo.svg|thumb|left|As one of the only [[international organizations]] with real enforcement power through trade sanctions, the [[WTO]] has been the target for calls by labour lawyers to incorporate global standards of the [[International Labour Organization]].]]
Because the ILO's enforcement mechanisms are weak,{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} incorporating [[labour standards in the World Trade Organization]]'s (WTO) operation has been proposed. WTO oversees, primarily, the [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]] treaty aimed at reducing [[customs]], [[tariff]]s and other barriers to import and export of goods, services and capital between its 157 member countries. Unlike for the ILO, contravening WTO rules as recognized by the [[Dispute settlement in the World Trade Organization|dispute settlement procedures]] opens a country to retaliation through [[trade sanctions]]. This could include reinstatement of targeted tariffs against the offender.

Proponents have called for a "[[social clause]]" to be inserted into the GATT agreements, for example, by amending Article XX, which provides an exception that allows imposition of sanctions for breaches of human rights. An explicit reference to core labour standards could allow comparable action where a WTO member state breaches ILO standards. Opponents argue that such an approach could undermine labour rights, because industries, and therefore workforces could be harmed with no guarantee of reform. Furthermore, it was argued in the 1996 Singapore Ministerial Declaration 1996 that "the [[comparative advantage]] of countries, particularly low-age developing countries, must in no way be put into question."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Singapore Ministerial Declaration|publisher=World Trade Organization|url=http://www.wto.org/english/thewto_e/minist_e/min96_e/wtodec_e.htm|date=13 December 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some countries want to take advantage of low wages and fewer rules as a comparative advantage to boost their economies. Another contested point is whether business moves production from high wage to low wage countries, given potential differences in worker productivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Elliot, Kimberly Ann|editor-first=Richard B.|editor-last=Freeman|title=Can Labor Standards Improve Under Globalization?|year=2003|publisher=Institute for International Economics|location=Washington, DC|isbn=9780881323320|editor-link=RB Freeman}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since GATT, most trade agreements have been bilateral. Some of these protect core labour standards.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}&lt;!--reason="many"--&gt;{{efn|e.g. [[European Union–South Korea Free Trade Agreement]] (14 May 2011) OJ 2011 L127, Article 13. }} Moreover, in domestic tariff regulations, some countries give preference to countries that respect core labour rights, for example under the EC Tariff Preference Regulation, articles 7 and 8.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/customs/customs_duties/rules_origin/preferential/article_781_en.htm Tariff Preference Regulation (EC) No. 732/2008 Articles 7, 8, 15, and Annex II and III]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Work in multiple countries===
{{main|Conflict of laws}}
[[Conflicts of laws]] (or [[private international law]]) issues arise where workers work in multiple jurisdictions. If a US worker performs part of her job in Brazil, China and Denmark (a "peripatetic" worker) an employer may seek to characterize the employment contract as governed by the law of the country where labour rights are least favourable to the worker, or seek to argue that the most favourable system of labour rights does not apply. For example, in a [[UK labour law]] case, ''[[Ravat v Halliburton Manufacturing and Services Ltd]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Ravat v Halliburton Manufacturing and Services Ltd |vol= |reporter= |opinion= |pinpoint= |court=[[United Kingdom Supreme Court]] |date=8 February 2012 |url=http://www.bailii.org/cgi-bin/markup.cgi?doc=/uk/cases/UKSC/2012/1.html&amp;query=ravat&amp;method=boolean |accessdate= |quote=}} ([2012] UKSC 1)&lt;/ref&gt; Ravat was from the UK but was employed in Libya by a German company that was part of [[Halliburton]]. He was dismissed by a supervisor based in [[Egypt]]. He was told he would be hired under UK law terms and conditions, and this was arranged by a staffing department in Aberdeen. Under the UK [[Employment Rights Act 1996]] he would have a right to claim unfair dismissal, but the Act left open the question of the statute's territorial scope. The UK Supreme Court held that the principle would be that an expatriate worker, would be subject to UK rules if the worker could show a "close connection" to the UK, which was found in Rabat's case.{{efn|See also ''[[Lawson v Serco Ltd]]'' ([http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/2006/3.html 2006 UKHL 3]) and ''[[Duncombe v Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families]]'' ([http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKSC/2011/36.html 2011 UKSC 36]) }}

This fits within the general framework in the EU. Under EU [[Rome I Regulation]] article 8,&lt;ref&gt;[[Rome I Regulation]] (Regulation (EC) No 593/2008) [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2008:177:0006:0006:en:PDF Full text]&lt;/ref&gt; workers have employment rights of the country where they habitually work. They may have a claim in another country if they can establish a close connection to it. The Regulation emphasises that the rules should be applied with the purpose of protecting the worker.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2008:177:0006:0006:en:PDF Rome I], recital 23 and [http://europa.eu/legislation_summaries/justice_freedom_security/judicial_cooperation_in_civil_matters/l33054_en.htm Brussels I], recital 13&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also necessary that a court has jurisdiction to hear a claim. Under the [[Brussels I Regulation]] article 19,&lt;ref&gt;[http://europa.eu/legislation_summaries/justice_freedom_security/judicial_cooperation_in_civil_matters/l33054_en.htm Brussels I Regulation (EC) No 44/2001]&lt;/ref&gt; this requires the worker habitually works in the place where the claim is brought, or is engaged there.

===EU law===
{{more citations needed|date=October 2013|section}}
{{main|EU law|European labour law|Directive on services in the internal market}}
The European Union has extensive labour laws that officially exclude (according to the [[Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union]]) matters around direct wage regulation (e.g. setting a minimum wage), fairness of dismissals and collective bargaining. A series of Directives regulate almost all other issues, for instance the [[Working Time Directive]] guarantees 28 days of paid holiday, the [[Equality Framework Directive]] prohibits all forms of discrimination and the [[Collective Redundancies Directive]] requires that proper notice is given and consultation takes place on decisions about economic dismissals.

However, the [[European Court of Justice]] has recently extended the Treaties provisions via [[case law]]. Trade unions have sought to organize across borders in the same way that [[multinational corporations]] have organized production globally. Unions have sought to take collective action and strikes internationally. However, this coordination was challenged in the [[European Union]] in two controversial decisions. In ''[[Laval Ltd v Swedish Builders Union]]''&lt;ref&gt;''[[Laval Ltd v Swedish Builders Union]]'' C-319/05 (2008) [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:62005J0341:EN:HTML Case text]&lt;/ref&gt; a group of Latvian workers were sent to a construction site in Sweden. The local union took industrial action to make Laval Ltd sign up to the local collective bargaining agreement. Under the [[Posted Workers Directive]], article 3 lays down minimum standards for foreign workers so that workers receive at least the minimum rights that they would have in their home country in case their place of work has lower minimum rights. Article 3(7) says that this "shall not prevent application of terms and conditions of employment which are more favourable to workers". Most people thought this meant that more favourable conditions could be given than the minimum (e.g., in Latvian law) by the host state's legislation or a collective agreement. However the [[European Court of Justice]] (ECJ) said that only the local state could raise standards beyond its minimum for foreign workers. Any attempt by the host state, or a collective agreement (unless the collective agreement is declared universal under article 3(8)) would infringe the business' freedom under [[TFEU]] article 56. This decision was implicitly reversed by the European Union legislature in the [[Rome I Regulation]], which makes clear in recital 34 that the host state may allow more favourable standards. However, in ''[[The Rosella]]'', the ECJ held that a blockade by the [[International Transport Workers Federation]] against a business that was using an [[Estonia]]n [[flag of convenience]] (i.e., saying it was operating under Estonian law to avoid labour standards of Finland) infringed the business' right of free establishment under [[TFEU]] article 49. The ECJ said that it recognized the workers' "right to strike" in accordance with ILO Convention 87, but said that its use must be proportionately to the right of the business' establishment.

The [[:fr:Accords de Grenelle|Grenelle accords]] negotiated on May 25 and 26th in the middle of the May 1968 crisis, reduced the working week to 44 hours and created trade union sections in each enterprise.&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} ''[[:fr:section syndicale d'entreprise|Section syndicale d'entreprise]]''  December 27, 1968 law&lt;/ref&gt; The minimum wage was increased by 25%.&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} [[:fr:Salaire minimum interprofessionnel garanti|SMIG]]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, [[Lionel Jospin]]'s government enacted the [[35-hour workweek]], reduced from 39 hours.

Despite the 40-hour standard maximum work week,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deskinlawfirm.com/working_more_than_72_hours_in_a_week_cannot_be_required |title=Working More than 72 Hours in a Week Cannot be Required |publisher=Deskin Law Firm |date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; some lines of work require more than 40 hours. For example, farm workers may work over 72 hours a week, followed by at least 24 hours off.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}} Exceptions to the break period exist for certain harvesting employees, such as those involved in harvesting grapes, tree fruits and cotton.

Professionals, clerical (administrative assistants), technical, and mechanical employees cannot be terminated for refusing to work more than 72 hours in a work week.&lt;ref&gt;Aguilar, Victoria. [http://theargroup.com/remember-exemptions-flsa/ "Remember Exemptions to the FLSA"], ''[[The AR Group, LLP]]'', Colorado, 13 January 2015. Retrieved on 15 January 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;
These ceilings, combined with a competitive job market, often motivate American workers to work more hours. American workers on average take the fewest days off of any developed country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0922052.html |title=Paid Vacation Around the World |work=infoplease |publisher=Pearson Education}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments of the [[United States Constitution]] limit the power of the [[Federal government of the United States|federal]] and [[U.S. state|state]] governments to [[discriminate]]. The private sector is not directly constrained by the Constitution, but several laws, particularly the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]], limit the private sector discrimination against certain groups. The [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment]]&lt;ref name=us-amendments&gt;{{cite web|url=http://finduslaw.com/us_constitution_5th_and_14th_amendments#1 |title=US Constitution&amp;nbsp;– 5th and 14th Amendments |publisher=findUSlaw}}&lt;/ref&gt; has an explicit requirement that the Federal Government not deprive individuals of "life, liberty, or property", without due process of law and an implicit guarantee that each person receive equal protection of the law. The [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]]&lt;ref name=us-amendments /&gt; explicitly prohibits states from violating an individual's rights of [[due process]] and [[equal protection]]. Equal protection limits the State and Federal governments' power to [[discriminate]] in their employment practices by treating employees, former employees, or job applicants unequally because of membership in a group, like a race, religion or sex. [[Due process]] protection requires that employees have a fair procedural process before they are terminated if the termination is related to a "liberty", like the right to [[free speech]], or a property interest.

The [[National Labor Relations Act]], enacted in 1935 as part of the [[New Deal]] legislation, guarantees workers the right to form unions and engage in collective bargaining.

The [[Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967]] prohibits employment discrimination based on age with respect to employees 40 years of age or older.

Title VII of the Civil Rights Act is the principal federal statute with regard to [[employment discrimination]], prohibiting unlawful employment discrimination by public and private employers, [[trade union|labour organizations]], training programmes and employment agencies based on race or colour, religion, sex and national origin. Retaliation is also prohibited by Title VII against any person for opposing any practice forbidden by statute, or for making a charge, testifying, assisting, or participating in a proceeding under the statute. The [[Civil Rights Act of 1991]] expanded the damages available to Title VII cases and granted Title VII plaintiffs the right to jury trial.&lt;ref name="Finduslaw.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://finduslaw.com/civil_rights_act_of_1964_cra_title_vii_equal_employment_opportunities_42_us_code_chapter_21|title=Civil Rights Act of 1964 |publisher=findUSlaw}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Halakhah (Jewish religious law) ===
The beginnings of halakhic labour law are in the Bible, in which two commandments refer to this subject: The law against delayed wages (Lev. 19:13; Deut. 24:14-15) and the worker's right to eat the employer's crops (Deut. 23:25-26). The Talmudic law—in which labour law is called "laws of worker hiring"—elaborates on many more aspects of employment relations, mainly in Tractate Baba Metzi'a. In some issues the Talamud, following the Tosefta, refers the parties to the customary law: "All is as the custom of the region [postulates]". 
Modern halakhic labour law developed very slowly. Rabbi Israel Meir Hacohen (the Hafetz Hayim) interprets the worker's right for timely payment in a tendency that clearly favours the employee over the employer, but does not refer to new questions of employment relations. Only in the 1920s we find the first halakhic authority to tackle the questions of trade unions (that could easily be anchored in Talmudic law) and the right of strike (which is quite problematic in terms of Talmudic law). Rabbis [[Abraham Isaac Kook|A.I Kook]] and [[Ben-Zion Meir Hai Uziel|B.M.H. Uziel]] tend to [[corporatism|corporatist]] settling of labour [[conflict (process)|conflict]]s, while Rabbi [[Moshe Feinstein]] clearly adopts the liberal democratic [[collective bargaining]] model. Since the 1940s the halakhic literature on labour law was enriched by books and articles that referred to growing range of questions and basically adopted the liberal democratic approach.

'''Lehmann Bernheimer''' (27 December 1841 - 29 May 1918) was a German antique dealer, who built the [[Bernheimer-Haus]] in Munich.

He was born on 27 December 1841 in Buttenhausen in Münsingen, Württemberg, the third child of Meier Bernheimer (1801-1870) and his wife Sarah, née Kahn (1803-1881).

In 1887, Bernheimer bought a small coffee house and beer garden, owned and run by an Englishman, and called the ''English Café''. In its place was built the [[Bernheimer-Haus]], which was opened in December 1889 by [[Luitpold, Prince Regent of Bavaria|Prince Regent Luitpold]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1=Bauer | first1=Richard |last2=Brenner | first2=Michael Brenner |date=2006 | title=Jüdisches München |language=German | location= |publisher=C.H. Beck | page=129 | isbn=978-3-406-54979-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially the focus was on high-quality textiles, with the manufacture of luxury goods being slowly added. After a fire in 1897, the building was extended and antiques, tapestries and carpets were added. On his death in 1918, his son, [[Otto Bernheimer]] took over.

In this list, founders of a company which [[merged]] with other companies to form a new company are counted as founders of the new company. However, founders of a company which later dissolved into several successor companies are ''not'' counted as founders of those successor companies; this same rule applies to [[Spin-off (corporate)|spin-off companies]]. Finally, a defunct company is a company that stopped functioning completely (e.g., [[Bankruptcy|bankrupt]]) without dissolving, merging or being [[Acquisitions|acquired]].

      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4040">In the [[United Kingdom]], a form of company structure has evolved known as a '''managed service company''' (MSC). Largely born from the [[IR35]] legislation in 1999 which came into force in 2000, this form of corporate structure places workers and contractors typically into a group of between five and eight people as shareholders in a limited company owned and run by the service provider. Sometimes the workers will be appointed as directors but always shareholders. As shareholders they can then receive minimum salary payments and the balance of income as [[dividends]]. Usually the service provider would perform administrative and [[company secretary]] duties and offer basic taxation advice.

These forms became popular with independent contractors and were used as a way of earning high net returns (up to 85% of gross){{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} compared to [[PAYE]], with little corporate responsibilities. In return, the providers charge a fee for delivering the service. To work within this form, workers must usually pass [[IR35]] tests to ensure they are able to take dividend payments.

In December 2006 the UK Treasury/[[HMRC]] introduced draft legislation "Tackling Managed Service Legislation" which sought to address the use of "composite" structures to avoid Income Tax and National Insurance on forms of trading that the Treasury deemed as being akin to "employed". After a period of consultation and re-draft, the new legislation became law in April 2007 with additional aspects coming into force in August 2007 and fully in January 2008. A PAYE [[umbrella company]] is effectively exempted from the legislation, which also seeks to pass the possible burden of unpaid debt (should a provider "collapse" a structure) to interested parties e.g. A recruitment agency that has been deemed to encourage or facilitate the scheme.

A number of MSC providers have since withdrawn from the market and have either converted to [[PAYE]] operations or sought to become seen as true accountants rather than scheme promoters.

Managed service companies (MSC) differ from personal service companies (PSC) as it's the MSC that manages and controls the affairs of the business, not the contractor.

The 2007 Budget legislated against MSCs by removing the associated tax advantages for contractors working through them. Prior to the government's action, there were several varieties of a managed service company. 

One of the most common forms was the composite company, where typically up to twenty contractors became non-director shareholders. The contractors received a low salary and expenses with the remainder payable as a dividend. This method of remuneration provided many financial benefits, since it avoided the payment of national insurance and income tax that would otherwise be payable if the contractor was paid entirely under PAYE (salary).

HMRC grew increasingly frustrated with the use of MSCs which, when investigated, were able to liquidate (as they had no assets) and start trading under a new company the next day. Following the MSC legislation, it is now the responsibility of a MSC provider to correctly operate PAYE and deduct the necessary tax and NI on all income payable to a subcontractor. 

To reinforce this law, the government have permitted the recovery of any underpaid taxes from appropriate third parties; principally those behind the MSC as well as connected or controlling parties.

Some companies still offer variations on these schemes so it can be confusing to a contractor to know what is legal and what is not. The simplest way to operate compliantly is if you decide to work via your own PSC then you must run it yourself, do not delegate control or key decisions to a third party supplier.

'''Máximo Eduardo Lanusse''' (born October 11, 1973) is an [[Argentina|Argentinian]] lawyer and banker who is the Administration Manager of [[Macro Bank]]. He has been investigated by the Argentinian judiciary for his involvement in the "Boudougate" scandal.

==Early life and education==
Born on October 11, 1973, Lanusse received his law degree from the [[University of Buenos Aires]].&lt;ref name=forbes&gt;{{cite web| title =Maximo Eduardo Lanusse| work =Forbes| url =https://www.forbes.com/profile/maximo-eduardo-lanusse/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

===Macro Bank===
He was the Administration Manager of Macro Bank beginning in February 2007.&lt;ref name=forbes/&gt; According to ''La Nacion'', Macro Bank distanced itself from Lanusse as the Boudougate scandal grew in 2012. He was forced to leave the bank, although his brother, Javier, continued to run a branch of the bank in the province of Jujuy.&lt;ref name=lanac&gt;{{cite web| last =Mon| first =Hug Alconada| title =Ciccone: otro aporte extraño y millonario| work =La Nacion| date =Sep 5, 2012| url =http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1505494-ciccone-otro-aporte-extrano-y-millonario}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Boudougate==
{{Main|Boudougate}}

Lanusse was Vice President of the shell company The Old Fund, chaired by [[Alejandro Vandenbroele]], which purchased 70% of the shares of the printing firm Ciccone Calcografica. Ciccone Calcografica later changed its name to the Compañía de Valores Sudamericana (American Securities Company), or CVS, upon the naming of Lanusse and Nicolas Ciccone Tadeo as members of its board in July 2011. The purpose of the acquisition of Ciccone Calcografica was to profit from federal government contracts for the production of currency.&lt;ref name=perf&gt;{{cite web| last =Agular| first =Natalia| title =Máximo Lanusse y los indicios en el expediente que apuntan a Brito| work =Perfil| date =Jun 22, 2014| url =http://www.perfil.com/politica/Maximo-Lanusse-y-los-indicios-en-el-expediente-que-apuntan-a-Brito-20140621-0091.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=lapol&gt;{{cite web| title =El fiscal De Lello pidió la indagatoria de Boudou| work =La Politica Online| date =Feb 6, 2014| url =http://www.lapoliticaonline.com/nota/78298/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''La Nacion'' reported on September 5, 2012, that Lanusse had deposited a total of about $5.4 million in an account in Santandar Rio bank in the name of The Old Fund several weeks before the Boudougate scandal broke. These deposits raised concerns at the bank, which sent a "suspicious transaction report" to the Financial Intelligence Unit. They occurred at a time when The Old Fund was making money, earning $13 million from the Front for Victory (FPV) for the printing of election ballots and contracting with the National Mint for the printing of $100 banknotes at a price of $9.6 million per month. Because of the need to pay wages as well as the debts of the former incarnation of Ciccone Calcografica, the funds Lanusse deposited in the bank were crucial for the firm's survival.&lt;ref name=lanac/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =Argentina: La UIF suma reportes por actividades sospechosas| work =Antilavado De Dinero| date =Sep 5, 2012| url =http://www.antilavadodedinero.com/news_det.php?id=5183}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An October 2012 news story in ''Clarin'' revealed that Vandenbroele had earned 38,000 pesos a month as president of CVS, while Lanusse had earned 48,000 pesos as the same firm's vice president, according to a new government report. ''Clarin'' noted that it is unheard of for the salary of a company's vice president to exceed that of its president, and described this "inexplicable" situation as "one more of the many curiosities about the Ciccone scandal."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last =Moores| first =Lucio Fernandez| title =Vandenbroele presidía Ciccone, pero ganaba menos que su vice| work =Clarin| date =Oct 1, 2012| url =http://www.clarin.com/politica/Vandenbroele-presidia-Ciccone-ganaba-vice_0_784721560.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 2, 2014, prosecutor Jorge Di Lello asked Judge Ariel Lijo to order an investigation of Lanusse, in addition to Jose Maria Nunez Carmona, Alejandro Vandenbroele, and others, for their involvement in "different stages" of the irregular activity surrounding The Old Fund's purchase of Ciccone Calcografica SA. Lijo ordered the investigation shortly thereafter. Allegedly, Lanusse had deposited large sums of money into the firm's accounts in Banco Macro. Reports stated that The Old Fund was financed principally by the Cooperativa de Crédito Marítima del Sur, managed by Cirilo Zavalía, who was linked to the Macro Group. Another firm that partially financed The Old Fund was Facimex Bursátil Sociedad de Bolsa, which placed $620 million in government securities into an account that Dusbel, a subsidiary of The Old Fund, opened at Facimex. These securities, converted into pesos, were deposited into The Old Fund's account in Macro Bank.&lt;ref name=perf/&gt;&lt;ref name=lapol/&gt;

It was reported on June 12, 2014, that Lanusse was the real CEO of CVS, with Alejandro Vandenbroele being only a front man.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last =Cherashny| first =Guillermo| title =Máximo Lanusse, gerente del Banco Macro, era el CEO real de la ex Ciccone| work =Informador Publico| date =Jun 12, 2014| url =http://informadorpublico.com/2014/06/12/maximo-lanusse-gerente-del-banco-macro-era-el-ceo-real-de-la-ex-ciccone/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A report on June 30, 2014, in the political journal ''Letra P'' stated that prosecutor Jorge Di Lello, since three days earlier, had had "an obsession," namely ensuring the investigation of Lanusse. The report stated that Lanusse, according to many who had encountered him over the course of his banking career, had never been particularly bright, but "no one denies that he moved like a lynx" when selling anything and making a profit off of it.

==Personal life==
As of September 2012, Lanusse lived in a rented apartment in Recoleta.&lt;ref name=lanac/&gt;

{{Nihongo|'''Osamu Suzuki'''|鈴木 修|Suzuki Osamu|born January 30, 1930}} is a [[Japanese people|Japanese]] businessman and the current Chairman of [[Suzuki Motor Corporation]].&lt;ref name="Suzuki Global"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.globalsuzuki.com/corporate/outline/ | title=Suzuki Global | accessdate=August 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wall Street Journal"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://topics.wsj.com/person/S/osamu-suzuki/6385 | title=Wall Street Journal | accessdate=August 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Government of India]] honored him in 2007 with the [[Padma Bhushan]], the third highest civilian award, for his services to the [[India]]n motor industry.&lt;ref name="Padma announcement"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.rediff.com/news/report/padma/20070323.htm | title=Padma announcement | accessdate=August 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life ==

Osamu Matsuda was born in [[Gero, Gifu]], a Japanese city on the banks of [[Hida River|River Hida]], to Toshiki S. Matsuda and Shunzo, on January 30, 1930. After graduating from the Chuo University in 1953,&lt;ref name="Wall Street Journal" /&gt; Osamu started his career as a loan officer in a local bank. His life took a turn when he married Shoko Suzuki, the granddaughter of the patriarch of [[Suzuki Motor Corporation]], [[Michio Suzuki (inventor)|Michio Suzuki]]. As Suzuki family did not have a male heir, Osamu was married into the family, and following the Japanese custom, Osamu took up the family name of Suzuki, to become Osamu Suzuki.&lt;ref name="Reference for Business"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.referenceforbusiness.com/biography/S-Z/Suzuki-Osamu-1930.html | title=Reference for Business | accessdate=August 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hirotaka Ono" /&gt; He is the fourth adopted son to run the company.&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-19505088 | title=Adult adoptions: Keeping Japan's family firms alive |publisher=BBC | accessdate=August 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shoko and Osamu Suzuki have three children and the family lives in [[Hamamatsu]] city in the Prefecture of [[Shizuoka Prefecture|Shizuoka]], in Japan.&lt;ref name="Reference for Business" /&gt;

==Career==

Osamu Suzuki joined [[Suzuki Motor Corporation]] in 1958, worked through various positions including junior management posts and rose to the rank of the Director, in 1963. He became the Junior Managing Director in 1967 and was promoted to the post of the Senior Managing Director, in 1972. In 1978, Osamu became the President and the Chief Executive Officer of the Corporation and, in 2000, he stepped down from the post of the CEO to take up the Chairmanship of the Suzuki Motor Corporation.&lt;ref name="Reference for Business" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hirotaka Ono" /&gt;

With more than three decades as the head of Suzuki Motor Corporation, Osamu Suzuki is reported to be one of the longest serving leaders in the global auto industry.&lt;ref name="Reference for Business" /&gt; Recently, concerns are afloat regarding the successor to Osamu Suzuki, which started taking rounds since the death of Hirotaka Ono, Osamu's son in law, who was being groomed for the take over. Hirotaka Ono died in 2007, at the age of 52, succumbing to pancreatic cancer.&lt;ref name="Hirotaka Ono"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/news/article.cfm?c_id=3&amp;objectid=11284732 | title=Hirotaka Ono | accessdate=August 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Magnetti Marelli"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.magnetimarelli.com/pt/focus-on-automotive/suzuki-lack-clarity-over-who-will-succeed-osamu-suzuki | title=Magnetti Marelli | accessdate=August 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career highlights==
Osamu Suzuki is credited to have transformed Suzuki Corporation into one of the largest small car manufacturers in the world. Instead of taking the major automakers head-on, Osamu expanded the company by finding new markets for its small cars, a strategy, often termed as marketing by diplomacy. He traveled around the globe to find prospective markets for his low priced cars and used diplomacy to penetrate them by forging new alliances.&lt;ref name="Reference for Business" /&gt;

The market run of Suzuki started in the late sixties when they started setting up satellite manufacturing units abroad. The first of such plants was in Thailand in 1967 which was followed by another one in Indonesia, in 1974. The next year saw Suzuki's entry into the Philippines. In 1980, Suzuki started a plant in Australia and another one in Pakistan, in 1982.&lt;ref name="Reference for Business" /&gt; He was also successful in forming an alliance with [[General Motors]], which gained Suzuki Corporation, an entry into the European market.&lt;ref name="Hirotaka Ono" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Auto news"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.autonews.com/article/20140628/OEM02/306289995/suzukis-84-year-old-ceo-causes-concern-over-lack-of-succession-plan | title=Auto news | accessdate=August 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most notable achievements of Osamu Suzuki is his entry into the Indian market in the early eighties. In 1982, Suzuki formed a partnership with the Government of India to launch [[Maruti Udyog Limited]] and transformed the market which, until then, was dominated by old fashioned automobiles which ran on outdated technology. In the next decade, the factory turned into the hub of Suzuki manufacturing for the [[Indian subcontinent]] and [[East European]] markets, producing around 200,000 units a year.&lt;ref name="Reference for Business" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hirotaka Ono" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Auto news" /&gt;

Suzuki entered the [[New Zealand]] market in 1984 and five years later, in 1989, extended its reach to [[Canada]] while maintaining the service to the markets of [[Nepal]] and [[Bangladesh]] through its Indian manufacturing unit, to take the total production to 10 million units. By 1993, Suzuki was selling 3 out of 4 and 2 out of 3 cars sold in India and Pakistan respectively and was selling more cars than any other Japanese manufacturer. The nineties also saw Suzuki entering the Asian markets of Korea and Vietnam as well as Egypt and Hungary.&lt;ref name="Reference for Business" /&gt;

Brisk overseas expansion tailored by Osamu Suzuki made the company grow to such levels that by the start of the 21st century, it had 60 plants in 31 countries and with a sales reach in 190 countries. It even experienced a one-year growth of 33.7 per cent in 2003 with the sales turn over reaching {{USD}}16.8157 billion. The next year saw Suzuki becoming the largest small car manufacturer in Japan, The two wheeler division, the third behind [[Honda]] and [[Yamaha Motor Company|Yamaha]] and the outboard engine division making rapid strides.&lt;ref name="Reference for Business" /&gt;

Suzuki Corporation made a record profit of {{JPY}}107.5 billion and its shares rose 13 per cent against the 3.5 percent decline experienced by the market.&lt;ref name="Hirotaka Ono" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Auto news" /&gt;

==Legacy==

Osamu Suzuki built the Suzuki empire, in a conservative way, by looking across the globe for prospective buyers and by cutting costs sharply. He is stated to be concerned about wasteful spending and always on the look-out for ways to save costs. It is reported that once, during a routine factory inspection, he cited 215 cases of wasteful expenditure such as removing 1900 [[light bulbs]] to save {{USD}}40,000 in [[electricity]] costs,&lt;ref name="Librarum"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://librarum.org/book/16010/169 | title=Librarum | accessdate=August 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; asking the executives to take split trip railway tickets, rather than direct fare tickets, thereby saving {{USD}}2 per ticket and changing the color of the factory floor to save paint.&lt;ref name="Reference for Business" /&gt;

During his reign as the [[Chief Executive Officer]], Suzuki Corporation was transformed into a global [[conglomerate (company)|conglomerate]]. He was successful in spreading the Suzuki message in 190 countries where the auto giant is having significant presence. He had the vision to avoid a direct fight with the other global auto manufacturers who were competing with each other using cutting edge technology.&lt;ref name="Reference for Business" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Librarum" /&gt; Instead, he looked out for unexplored markets with small but modern cars which changed the automobile trends in the countries he entered. In [[India]], for example, he introduced small modern cars when the market was dominated by old fashioned, outdated cars, there by, reportedly, revolutionizing the auto industry.&lt;ref name=unconvincing&gt;{{cite journal | title = Automobile Industry: Unconvincing Explanations | journal = Economic and Political Weekly | number = 16 | volume = XX | location = Mumbai, India | publisher = Sameeksha Trust | page = 669 | date = 1985-04-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Osamu Suzuki's fiscal prudence is reported to be one of the reasons behind the rise of Suzuki Motor Corporation to the status of an auto giant by selling small low priced cars, still making a profit.&lt;ref name="Reference for Business" /&gt;

Murphy served as the [[United States Ambassador to Germany]] from 2009 to 2013, during which time he dealt with fallout from the [[United States diplomatic cables leak]]. He served as finance chairman for the [[Democratic National Committee]] in the mid-late 2000s under [[Howard Dean]]. Before that Murphy had a 23-year career at [[Goldman Sachs]], where he held several high-level positions and accumulated considerable wealth before retiring in 2006. He is additionally involved in many civic organizations and philanthropic pursuits. While planning to run for governor, Murphy launched New Way for New Jersey, a [[Progressivism in the United States|liberal]] organization intended to increase his political visibility in the state.

===Personal wealth===
Murphy's position at Goldman Sachs when the firm had its [[IPO]] brought his net worth above $50 million.&lt;ref name=nwfnj&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politico.com/story/2015/07/murphy-likely-nj-gubernatorial-candidate-gets-a-super-pac-120575|title=Phil Murphy, likely N.J. gubernatorial candidate, gets a super PAC|publisher=|accessdate=September 29, 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161008030639/http://www.politico.com/story/2015/07/murphy-likely-nj-gubernatorial-candidate-gets-a-super-pac-120575|archivedate=October 8, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; By one estimate, reported in ''[[Der Spiegel]]'' in 2009, his wealth after leaving the firm was in the range of several hundred million dollars.&lt;ref name=second/&gt;

Murphy moved to [[Middletown Township, New Jersey]], in the late 1990s.&lt;ref name=winners&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.app.com/story/news/local/elections/2017/06/07/phil-murphy-kim-guadagno-new-jersey-gubernatorial-election-2017/374941001/|title=NJ's next governor: Phil Murphy or Kim Guadagno|publisher=|accessdate=August 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He and his family live in a riverside estate with a $200,000 annual property tax bill.&lt;ref name="bloom" /&gt; Murphy also owns homes in Berlin and Italy.&lt;ref name="taxes"/&gt;

In 2016, Murphy released five years' worth of federal tax returns. In 2014 he earned about $6 million, paid about $2 million in taxes for an effective tax rate of 34%, and directly or indirectly donated 24% of his income to charity.&lt;ref name="taxes" /&gt; The returns for the other years showed effective tax rates ranging between 32% and 39%.&lt;ref name=obstacles&gt;{{cite web|url=http://observer.com/2016/05/phil-murphy-releases-tax-returns-from-past-five-years/|title=Phil Murphy Releases Tax Returns from Past Five Years|date=May 23, 2016|publisher=|accessdate=August 19, 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170819233834/http://observer.com/2016/05/phil-murphy-releases-tax-returns-from-past-five-years/|archivedate=August 19, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Murphy's charitable donations during these five years averaged about $980,000 a year.&lt;ref name=obstacles/&gt; Due to his wealth and the complicated nature of his holdings, his federal tax filings have been known to exceed 300 pages in length.&lt;ref name="taxes"/&gt;

===Finance career===
====Goldman Sachs====
Murphy began his career with a summer associate internship at [[Goldman Sachs]] in 1982.&lt;ref name = irish/&gt;&lt;ref name=allgov /&gt; He was hired after graduating in 1983.&lt;ref name=nation/&gt; He rose in the ranks quickly, later attributing that success to his ability to make deals: "Two people may not like each other and can't work together. Their mutual dislike is their problem. I don't let it become mine. I'll be the man in the middle and the three of us can work out something everybody is happy with."&lt;ref name=wui/&gt;

From 1993 to 1997, Murphy headed the firm's [[Frankfurt]] office.&lt;ref name=jamb/&gt;&lt;ref name=polly/&gt; His business responsibilities were later expanded to encompass Germany, Switzerland, and Austria, as well as in the emerging post-Warsaw Pact economies of Central Europe.&lt;ref name=amb/&gt; In this role he engaged in a number of transactions with the German government's [[Treuhandanstalt]] agency, whose purpose was to conduct the privatization of formerly state-owned enterprises within the boundaries of no-longer-extant [[East Germany]]. Murphy was also active in the [[Atlantik-Brücke]] organization, including co-founding its International Advisor Council.&lt;ref name=first/&gt;

From 1997 to 1999, Murphy served as the President of Goldman Sachs (Asia).&lt;ref name=polly/&gt; In that capacity, he was officed in [[Hong Kong]].&lt;ref name=penny&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nj.gov/benefitsreview/members.html|title=Benefits Review Task Force|publisher=|accessdate=September 29, 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081203001828/http://www.nj.gov/benefitsreview/members.html|archivedate=December 3, 2008|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this time Goldman Sachs profited from its investment in [[Yue Yuen Industrial Holdings]], a shoe manufacturer that became notorious for its harsh labor practices.&lt;ref name=yy&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nj.com/politics/index.ssf/2017/06/jim_johnson_hits_phil_murphy_over_goldman_sach_asi.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-06-04 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170605213427/http://www.nj.com/politics/index.ssf/2017/06/jim_johnson_hits_phil_murphy_over_goldman_sach_asi.html |archivedate=June 5, 2017 |df=mdy-all }} Research by NJ Advance Media&lt;/ref&gt; The $55 million investment was made the year before Murphy took the Asia post and it is unclear to what extent Murphy was aware of the firm's operational characteristics.&lt;ref name =yy/&gt; In 1998, Murphy told the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' that "We [at Goldman Sachs] are elite in the sense the Marine Corps is elite".&lt;ref name="nation"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thenation.com/article/can-a-sanders-democrat-win-the-new-jersey-governors-race/|title=Can a Sanders Democrat Win the New Jersey Governor's Race?|last=|first=|date=|work=The Nation|access-date=June 27, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170529211218/https://www.thenation.com/article/can-a-sanders-democrat-win-the-new-jersey-governors-race/|archive-date=May 29, 2017|dead-url=no|issn=0027-8378|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, Murphy secured a spot on the firm's Management Committee.&lt;ref name=irish/&gt; There his colleagues included [[Hank Paulson]] and [[Gary Cohn (investment banker)|Gary Cohn]], both of whom later served at highest levels of the federal government.&lt;ref name=nation/&gt; This coincided with the [[Glass–Steagall: aftermath of repeal]] and made a profound change in how Murphy and his colleagues made their profits, with much greater use of leverage than before.&lt;ref name=nation/&gt;

In 2001, Murphy became global co-head of the firm's Investment Management Division.&lt;ref name = irish/&gt;&lt;ref name = fort/&gt;&lt;ref name=nation/&gt; This unit oversaw the investments of foundations, pensions, hedge funds, and wealthy personages, and by 2003 had amassed $373 billion in holdings.&lt;ref name=nation/&gt; Hedge funds in particular received large lines of credit from Murphy's unit.&lt;ref name=nation/&gt; Another company initiative that Murphy helped to undertake was the unit that did major business in the emerging markets within the [[EMEA]] region.&lt;ref name= penny/&gt;

In 2003, Murphy's day-to-day responsibilities at the firm ended, and he became a Senior Director of the firm.&lt;ref name=nation/&gt; He retired in 2005-06.&lt;ref name=jamb/&gt;&lt;ref name=tough/&gt; In all, Murphy spent 23 years at Goldman Sachs.&lt;ref name=jamb/&gt;

====Democratic Party finance chair====
After leaving Goldman Sachs, Murphy served from 2006 to 2009 as the National Finance Chair of the [[Democratic National Committee]] (DNC), where he worked with DNC Chair [[Howard Dean]].&lt;ref name=blue&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bluejersey.com/2014/11/howard-deans-guy/|title=Howard Dean's guy|publisher=|accessdate=September 29, 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160611053628/http://www.bluejersey.com/2014/11/howard-deans-guy/|archivedate=June 11, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Murphy liked both Dean's vision for the party and the discipline Dean brought to the task, and the two became close friends.&lt;ref name=irish/&gt;

It was Murphy who financed Dean's "[[50-state strategy]]".&lt;ref name=blue/&gt; The strategy was opposed by powerful Democrats in Congress such as [[Charles Schumer]] and [[Rahm Emanuel]],&lt;ref name=fort&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.fortune.com/2007/10/10/news/newsmakers/murphy_dnc.fortune/index.htm|title=Philip Murphy goes to Washington - Oct. 11, 2007|first=By Nina Easton, Fortune Washington bureau|last=chief|publisher=|accessdate=September 29, 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160927090318/http://archive.fortune.com/2007/10/10/news/newsmakers/murphy_dnc.fortune/index.htm|archivedate=September 27, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; but Murphy refused to visibly engage in this dispute, saying, "I'm a sucker for the view that you have it out in the locker room, not in public."&lt;ref name=fort/&gt;  Former Goldman Sachs colleague and [[U.S. Secretary of the Treasury]] [[Robert Rubin]] said of Murphy's ability to handle the new position, "He has very substantial technical expertise from his corporate finance work, but he combines that with a wonderful facility for dealing with people."&lt;ref name=fort/&gt; Dean later said that Murphy well learned the lesson not all such figures of commerce understand: that while in business you can command people to do things, in politics things are never so simple.&lt;ref name=rooted/&gt;

During his first year Murphy focused on gaining donations from his contacts from his university years and Goldman Sachs; within that year he was able to substantially reduce the DNC's gap with the [[Republican National Committee]].&lt;ref name=fort/&gt; In all, Murphy says he raised $300 million for the DNC.&lt;ref name=jamb/&gt;

Murphy was also a big donor to Democratic candidates, giving them almost $1.5 million by 2009.&lt;ref name=open&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opensecrets.org/news/2009/07/phillip-murphy-new-ambassador/|title=Philip Murphy, New Ambassador to Germany, Gave Big to Democrats|date=July 10, 2009|publisher=|accessdate=September 29, 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170201162838/http://www.opensecrets.org/news/2009/07/phillip-murphy-new-ambassador/|archivedate=February 1, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; This included modest contributions to individual candidates and several six-figure sums to party committees.&lt;ref name=open/&gt; During the hotly contested [[Democratic presidential primaries, 2008|2008 Democratic presidential primaries]] he was a [[superdelegate]] but remained uncommitted for most of the contest.&lt;ref name=allgov/&gt;

Murphy has helped lead local charities to support troubled teens and domestic abuse survivors.

====New Jersey Benefits Task Force chair====
In May 2005,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nj.gov/benefitsreview/executive_order.html|title=Benefits Review Task Force|publisher=|accessdate=September 29, 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180324132739/http://www.nj.gov/benefitsreview/executive_order.html|archivedate=March 24, 2018|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Acting Governor [[Richard Codey]] named Murphy to chair the New Jersey Benefits Task Force on public sector employee benefits in response to the New Jersey pension crisis, a particularly long-running instance of the [[pensions crisis#U.S. State-level issues|state-level pensions crises taking place nationwide]].&lt;ref name=na/&gt;&lt;ref name=jamb/&gt;&lt;ref name=nation/&gt;

As chair, Murphy recommended the sale of publicly owned assets. For the most part that did not happen, but some of his other suggestions, such as raising the age of retirement and recalculating how pensions related to salary earned, were taken.&lt;ref name=7facts/&gt; Labor unions opposed the recommendations, with leader [[Carla Katz]] saying, "We will fight vigorously and loudly against any cuts to our pensions or health benefits proposed by the task force."&lt;ref name=nation/&gt; The ''[[New York Times]]'' wrote that "no matter what happens, the report's legacy may well be that it tried to tackle the issues head-on."&lt;ref name=tough/&gt;

[[File:Secretary_Kerry_Arrives_in_Berlin,_Germany.jpg|thumb|200px|Ambassador Murphy greeting Secretary of State [[John Kerry]] upon arrival in Berlin early in 2013]]
Regarding the [[European debt crisis]], Murphy said in 2013, "The big debate in Europe, which I think is a false debate, is either fiscal consolidation or growth. And the reality is that Europe needs both: it needs fiscal consolidation and growth."&lt;ref name=polly/&gt; Regarding economic differences between the nations, he said, "Germany believes strongly that the first order of business is to cut your debts and deficits and from that, good things will come. We're more likely to say a little bit of stimulus will jump-start things, even if it means incurring more debt. But you work your way through those issues."&lt;ref name=wall/&gt;

===Entry into New Jersey politics===
Murphy was mentioned as a potential candidate in the [[New Jersey gubernatorial election, 2013|2013 New Jersey gubernatorial election]], but did not run.&lt;ref name=jamb/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thirteen.org/metrofocus/2011/08/op-ed-handicapping-the-2013-nj-gubernatorial-race/|title=Op-Ed: Handicapping the 2013 NJ Gubernatorial Race|date=August 31, 2011|publisher=|accessdate=September 29, 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160504093134/http://www.thirteen.org/metrofocus/2011/08/op-ed-handicapping-the-2013-nj-gubernatorial-race/|archivedate=May 4, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rather, upon returning to the United States he returned to Murphy Endeavors LLC, a business management consultancy firm, of which he was the principal, with offices in [[Red Bank, New Jersey]].&lt;ref name=wall&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.app.com/story/news/local/monmouth-county/2014/11/02/philip-murphy-berlin-wall-anniversary-middletown-red-bank/18393551/|title=Berlin Wall anniversary resonates with Middletown's Murphy|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He started the firm in 2009 after leaving the DNC position, but it was soon put on hold due to his ambassadorial nomination.&lt;ref name=allgov/&gt; He also gave speeches about his experiences in Germany, especially in connection with the 25th anniversary of the [[fall of the Berlin Wall]].&lt;ref name = wall /&gt;

====New Start New Jersey====
In 2014, Murphy created New Start New Jersey, a nonprofit progressive policy think tank that held a number of events around New Jersey.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nsnj.org] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160515021805/http://www.nsnj.org/|date=May 15, 2016}} New Start New Jersey&lt;/ref&gt; His wife Tammy was co-founder, chair, and secretary.&lt;ref name="tammy"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.andover.edu/About/AdministrationGovernance/Pages/CharterTrusteeTammySnyderMurphy83.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-11-09 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100528134059/https://www.andover.edu/About/AdministrationGovernance/Pages/CharterTrusteeTammySnyderMurphy83.aspx |archivedate=May 28, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization said it would neither endorse nor fund political candidates, as it was barred from doing so,&lt;ref name=tout/&gt;&lt;ref name=nwfnj/&gt; but it did serve to raise Murphy's political visibility. Its events included an appearance by singer [[Jon Bon Jovi]].&lt;ref name=nwfnj/&gt; One of its goals was to help displaced workers back into the work force.&lt;ref name = irish /&gt; (Making reference to visibility, in 2016 [[Podesta emails|hacked Podesta emails]] revealed that Murphy was already seriously considering a run for governor when the organization was founded, telling Podesta that his ambitions were "''very'' serious but not yet committed" and that the new entity would improve his name recognition.&lt;ref name=pod&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wnyc.org/story/wikileaks-emails-small-look-dark-money-group-new-jersey/|title=In Wikileaks Emails, a Glimpse of Phil Murphy's Campaign for Governor|publisher=|accessdate=August 19, 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170819234520/http://www.wnyc.org/story/wikileaks-emails-small-look-dark-money-group-new-jersey/|archivedate=August 19, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

====New Way for New Jersey====
In September 2015, Murphy launched a progressive organization named New Way for New Jersey, which held a number of town halls, including some by telephone on Sunday evenings, and encouraged Democrats to sign petitions critical of incumbent Governor [[Chris Christie]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nj.com/politics/index.ssf/2015/09/likely_democratic_candidate_for_nj_governor_touts.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-05-17 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160629124852/http://www.nj.com/politics/index.ssf/2015/09/likely_democratic_candidate_for_nj_governor_touts.htm |archivedate=June 29, 2016 |df=mdy-all }} New Way for New Jersey&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike New Start New Jersey, New Way for New Jersey was an explicitly political organization.&lt;ref name=polfold/&gt;

====Criticism of Chris Christie====
During this time and making reference to [[Chris Christie presidential campaign, 2016|Christie's presidential campaign]] and his subsequent support and travel on behalf of [[Donald Trump presidential campaign, 2016|Donald Trump's presidential campaign]], Murphy implored Christie, "Do your job or quit."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mobile.bergendispatch.com/default.aspx?p=articles&amp;news=37755719&amp;title=Murphy-Calls-On-Governor-Christie-to-Do-His-Job-Or-Quit|title=Murphy Calls On Governor Christie to Do His Job Or Quit - Bergen Dispatch|publisher=|accessdate=September 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Murphy supported [[Hillary Clinton presidential campaign, 2016|Hillary Clinton in the 2016 Democratic primary]] and fundraised for her.&lt;ref name=7facts/&gt;

After Murphy announced his candidacy for governor, New Way for New Jersey folded.&lt;ref name=polfold&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politico.com/states/new-jersey/story/2016/05/phil-murphy-becomes-first-major-candidate-to-declare-run-for-governor-101750|title=Phil Murphy becomes first major candidate to declare run for governor|publisher=|accessdate=September 29, 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161005063714/http://www.politico.com/states/new-jersey/story/2016/05/phil-murphy-becomes-first-major-candidate-to-declare-run-for-governor-101750|archivedate=October 5, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; New Start New Jersey continued, albeit without Murphy on its board.&lt;ref name=polfold/&gt;

====2016 developments====
Murphy was the first declared Democratic candidate for governor, although several other candidates were expected to run. Mayor of Jersey City [[Steven Fulop]], Assemblyman [[John Wisniewski]] of [[Sayreville]], State Senator [[Raymond Lesniak]], and State Senate President [[Stephen M. Sweeney]] of [[Gloucester County, New Jersey|Gloucester County]] were often mentioned in news media along with other candidates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nj.com/hudson/index.ssf/2015/06/christie_announcement_means_little_for_fulops_gove.html|title=Christie news means little for Fulop's 2017 ambitions, experts say|publisher=|accessdate=September 29, 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160308132240/http://www.nj.com/hudson/index.ssf/2015/06/christie_announcement_means_little_for_fulops_gove.html|archivedate=March 8, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=shock/&gt;&lt;ref name=observer8&gt;{{cite web|url=http://observer.com/2016/08/into-the-bowels-of-2017-the-unfolding-dem-party-gov-race-back-drama/|title=Into the Bowels of 2017: The Unfolding NJ Dem Party Gov.

If Fulop or Sweeney stumbles, Murphy could rocket from zero to 100 overnight."&lt;ref name=observer8/&gt;

On September 28, 2016, Fulop announced he would not run for governor and endorsed Murphy.&lt;ref name=shock&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nj.com/politics/index.ssf/2016/09/fulop_wont_run_for_nj_governor_shifting_2017_race_to_succeed_christie.html|title=Fulop won't run for N.J. governor, a 'game-changer' for 2017 race to succeed Christie|publisher=|accessdate=September 29, 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161001053952/http://www.nj.com/politics/index.ssf/2016/09/fulop_wont_run_for_nj_governor_shifting_2017_race_to_succeed_christie.html|archivedate=October 1, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; On October 6, Sweeney announced he too would not run, citing apparent party support for Murphy, whom he endorsed.&lt;ref name="nj10"&gt;{{cite web|title=Sweeney says he won't run for Governor|url=http://www.nj.com/politics/index.ssf/2016/10/sweeney_says_he_wont_run_for_nj_governor.html|website=nj.com|accessdate=7 October 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161009120307/http://www.nj.com/politics/index.ssf/2016/10/sweeney_says_he_wont_run_for_nj_governor.html|archivedate=October 9, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The move came as Murphy was corralling dozens of endorsements, including all of those from North Jersey county party committees and the most populous Central Jersey county committees.&lt;ref name="cp10"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.courierpostonline.com/story/news/local/south-jersey/2016/10/06/murphy-racks-endorsements-sweeney-exits-race-governor/91705850/|title=Murphy racks up endorsements; Sweeney exits race for governor|publisher=|accessdate=August 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of these withdrawals Murphy became the clear front-runner for the nomination,&lt;ref name="nj10" /&gt; but Wisniewski and Lesniak, the two best-known remaining potential candidates, both said they still intended to run.&lt;ref name="app10"&gt;"Sweeney drops his bid for governor as Murphy rides high", ''Asbury Park Press'', October 7, 2016, pp. 1A, 2A.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the unexpected result of the [[United States presidential election, 2016|2016 United States presidential election]], Murphy noted that the fortunes of the state Democratic Party had improved in the election, saying, "As with so many, I am disappointed by the [presidential] results from Tuesday. But I refuse to be discouraged. And I won't be dissuaded from working to make New Jersey a fairer, more just place for all of us."&lt;ref&gt;Emailcast from Phil Murphy, "I Refuse to be Discouraged", November 10, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Murphy subsequently drew criticism from the [[New Jersey Lieutenant Governor]] and Republican candidate for governor, [[Kim Guadagno]], for seeming to draw a comparison between the Trump campaign and the early years of the [[rise of Nazi Germany|Nazi rise to power in Germany]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nj.com/politics/index.ssf/2017/02/lt_gov_guadagno_accuses_murphy_of_comparing_trump.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-03-05 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170321084656/http://www.nj.com/politics/index.ssf/2017/02/lt_gov_guadagno_accuses_murphy_of_comparing_trump.html |archivedate=March 21, 2017 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://mobile.nytimes.com/2017/02/23/us/democrats-dnc-chairman-trump-keith-ellison-tom-perez.html?referer=https://www.bing.com/news/search?q=phil+murphy+criticized+new+york+times&amp;FORM=HDRSC4&amp;PC=APPL|title=Trump campaign|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180103072420/https://mobile.nytimes.com/2017/02/23/us/democrats-dnc-chairman-trump-keith-ellison-tom-perez.html?referer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bing.com%2Fnews%2Fsearch%3Fq%3Dphil+murphy+criticized+new+york+times&amp;FORM=HDRSC4&amp;PC=APPL |archivedate=January 3, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 15, Wisniewski, who gained visibility as a leader of the [[Fort Lee lane closure scandal]] investigations, announced his run for governor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/local/NJ-Governor-Race-Announcement-401323006.html|title=Bridgegate Crusader John Wisniewski to Run For NJ Governor|publisher=|accessdate=August 19, 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170820033006/http://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/local/NJ-Governor-Race-Announcement-401323006.html|archivedate=August 20, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his message he implicitly criticized Murphy, saying "I'm not a Wall Street executive.

====2017 developments====
In January 2017, Murphy was endorsed by New Jersey's two U.S. senators, [[Bob Menendez]] and [[Cory Booker]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://observer.com/2017/01/nj-senators-menendez-and-booker-endorse-murphy-for-governor/|title=NJ Senators Menendez and Booker Endorse Murphy for Governor|date=January 9, 2017|publisher=|accessdate=August 19, 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170820033250/http://observer.com/2017/01/nj-senators-menendez-and-booker-endorse-murphy-for-governor/|archivedate=August 20, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also had the endorsements of all 21 county party organizations.&lt;ref name=stile&gt;Charles Stile, "For gubernatorial hopefuls, a chance to flex new identities," Asbury Park Press, May 30, 2017, page 1.&lt;/ref&gt; In statewide races, these designations offer favorable ballot position, which some voters pick by default, and are often central to success.&lt;ref name=stile/&gt;&lt;ref name =tunedout/&gt;

By February 2017, Murphy was leading by a solid margin in a [[Quinnipiac Poll]] both for the Democratic nomination and in a putative general election matchup against Guadagno.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nj1015.com/who-candidates-to-be-nj-governor-all-but-anonymous-poll-finds/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-02-11 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170212093038/http://nj1015.com/who-candidates-to-be-nj-governor-all-but-anonymous-poll-finds/ |archivedate=February 12, 2017 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another poll was less certain, showing most voters undecided.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.phillyvoice.com/latest-poll-reveals-uncertainty-race-new-jersey-governor/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-02-11 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170212164012/http://www.phillyvoice.com/latest-poll-reveals-uncertainty-race-new-jersey-governor/ |archivedate=February 12, 2017 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two debates with his main Democratic rivals, including former U.S. Treasury official [[Jim Johnson (New Jersey politician)|Jim Johnson]] along with Wiesiewski and Lesniak, were held within a short span of time in May; during the second Murphy found himself under sustained attack by his rivals, but defended himself by staking out very progressive positions.&lt;ref name=span&gt;{{cite web|url=http://observer.com/2017/05/winners-and-losers-the-week-of-the-primary-debate-deluge/|title=Winners and Losers: The Week of the Primary Debate Deluge|date=May 12, 2017|publisher=|accessdate=August 19, 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170819234120/http://observer.com/2017/05/winners-and-losers-the-week-of-the-primary-debate-deluge/|archivedate=August 19, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Politico]]'' wrote, "Underdogs Jim Johnson, Ray Lesniak and John Wisniewski savaged the front-runner, Phil Murphy, accusing him during the 90-minute televised contest of buying off party bosses and being disingenuous on environmental issues."&lt;ref name=savaged&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politico.com/states/new-jersey/story/2017/05/11/three-against-one-democratic-rivals-pile-on-murphy-112015|title=Three against one: Democratic rivals pile on Murphy during second debate|publisher=|accessdate=August 19, 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170819233010/http://www.politico.com/states/new-jersey/story/2017/05/11/three-against-one-democratic-rivals-pile-on-murphy-112015|archivedate=August 19, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent campaigning by those three continued to emphasize that Murphy was "buying" the election.&lt;ref name=winners/&gt; Nonetheless, polls continued to show Murphy with a sizable lead over all rivals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://stockton.edu/news/2017/poll-gubernatorial-race-may-2017.html|title=Stockton Poll: Murphy, Guadagno Lead in Primary Races for New Jersey Governor - News - Stockton University|website=stockton.edu|accessdate=August 19, 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170820033128/https://stockton.edu/news/2017/poll-gubernatorial-race-may-2017.html|archivedate=August 20, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.burlingtoncountytimes.com/news/local/election/poll-kim-guadagno-phil-murphy-still-leading-in-primaries/article_f034792a-4171-11e7-b13c-6bb3f7cff5ce.html|title=Poll: Kim Guadagno, Phil Murphy still leading in primaries|first=David Levinsky, staff|last=writer|publisher=|accessdate=August 19, 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170623021538/http://www.burlingtoncountytimes.com/news/local/election/poll-kim-guadagno-phil-murphy-still-leading-in-primaries/article_f034792a-4171-11e7-b13c-6bb3f7cff5ce.html|archivedate=June 23, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With $19 million raised, of which $15 million was his own money, Murphy continued to spend the most of all the candidates; his spending was more than twice that of all the other Democratic and Republican candidates for governor combined.&lt;ref name=savaged/&gt; He also donated $1.5 million to the various county party organizations as well as to some candidates for local offices.&lt;ref name=stile/&gt; Murphy captured the endorsement of the first major national figure to inject himself into the race, former Vice President [[Joe Biden]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nj.com/politics/index.ssf/2017/05/joe_biden_to_campaign_for_phil_murphy_in_nj_govern.html|title=Joe Biden to visit N.J. to campaign for Phil Murphy|publisher=|accessdate=August 19, 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170729033709/http://www.nj.com/politics/index.ssf/2017/05/joe_biden_to_campaign_for_phil_murphy_in_nj_govern.html|archivedate=July 29, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, he was endorsed by former Vice President [[Al Gore]], which helped solidify Murphy's environmentalist credentials after some attacks on his role as a financier investing in [[fracking]] operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://observer.com/2017/05/al-gore-endorses-murphy-for-nj-governor/|title=Al Gore Endorses Murphy for NJ Governor|date=May 17, 2017|publisher=|accessdate=August 19, 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170819233957/http://observer.com/2017/05/al-gore-endorses-murphy-for-nj-governor/|archivedate=August 19, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also had the fundraising support of wealthy entertainment figures [[Jon Bon Jovi]] and [[Whoopi Goldberg]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailyrecord.com/story/news/2017/05/31/bon-jovi-whoopi-back-phil-murphy-morristown/358372001/|title=Bon Jovi, Whoopi back Phil Murphy in Morristown|publisher=|accessdate=August 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most, though not all, of the key labor unions in the state, also supported Murphy.&lt;ref name=stile/&gt; Nevertheless, there was still a sense of apathy about the election on the part of the state's voters; as the ''New York Times'' stated shortly before the primary vote, "a majority of voters still say they 'don't know' who to vote for and are not doing much to find out."&lt;ref name = tunedout &gt;Nick Corasaniti, "New Jersey's Primary Nears With Many Voters Tuned Out," New York Times, June 5, 2017, p.

Murphy faced Guadagno, the Republican nominee, in the November general election.&lt;ref name=mountie/&gt; As that general campaign was underway, Guadagno ran as a moderate, attempting to avoid association with both Christie, who held a record-low approval rating for a governor, and [[Donald Trump]].&lt;ref name=moderate&gt;{{cite web |url=https://mobile.nytimes.com/2017/06/25/nyregion/rare-gop-species-runs-for-new-jersey-governor-a-moderate.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-06-26 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170626153150/https://mobile.nytimes.com/2017/06/25/nyregion/rare-gop-species-runs-for-new-jersey-governor-a-moderate.html |archivedate=June 26, 2017 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead she sought to focus on Murphy's Goldman Sachs background.&lt;ref name=moderate/&gt;

====Policy proposals====
*State bank: Murphy's campaign has suggested a [[Bank of North Dakota|North Dakota-style]] statewide investment bank as a way of boosting New Jersey's economy.&lt;ref&gt;"Phil Murphy's opening bid: A promising plan on economy", Tom Moran, ''Star-Ledger'', September 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; The bank would supply loans to not just businesses but also college students.&lt;ref name=stile/&gt; Moreover, it would have the effect of eliminating Wall Street firms&amp;nbsp;– including his own former one&amp;nbsp;– from participating in state financial activities.&lt;ref name=stile/&gt;
*Pensions: Regarding the state's still-troubled pension system, Murphy has said that there are no easy answers but that "the state has to stand up for its side of the bargain. Period. If the state doesn't, there is no use having the second-paragraph discussion."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trentonian.com/government-and-politics/20161017/nj-guv-hopeful-phil-murphy-engages-folks-at-tcnj|title=NJ guv hopeful Phil Murphy engages folks at TCNJ|publisher=|accessdate=August 19, 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170819233522/http://www.trentonian.com/government-and-politics/20161017/nj-guv-hopeful-phil-murphy-engages-folks-at-tcnj|archivedate=August 19, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Affordable housing/builder's remedy debate: In summer 2017, amid heavy local outcry over overdevelopment of apartment complexes and concerns about wealthy developers exploiting the [[Mount Laurel doctrine]] to overbuild small towns, Murphy proposed a solution that would not require more forced building. "With smart investments, we can create thousands of units of much-needed affordable housing without building a single new building," he said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nj.com/politics/index.ssf/2017/03/phil_murphy_has_a_plan_to_make_wall_st_pay_to_clea.html|title=Phil Murphy just unveiled a plan to make Wall St. clean up N.J. home foreclosures|publisher=|accessdate=August 19, 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170820000029/http://www.nj.com/politics/index.ssf/2017/03/phil_murphy_has_a_plan_to_make_wall_st_pay_to_clea.html|archivedate=August 20, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tenure===

{{Main Article|Governorship of Phil Murphy}}

Murphy was sworn in as Governor of New Jersey on January 16, 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Johnson|first1=Brett|title=Phil Murphy sworn in, replaces Chris Christie as N.J. governor|url=http://www.nj.com/politics/index.ssf/2018/01/phil_murphy_sworn_in_as_njs_new_governor.html|accessdate=17 January 2018|publisher=NJ.com|date=16 January 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180116225051/http://www.nj.com/politics/index.ssf/2018/01/phil_murphy_sworn_in_as_njs_new_governor.html|archivedate=January 16, 2018|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Investigation into hiring decisions===

On October 15, 2018, an independent investigation into Murphy's hiring of former Schools Development Authority Chief of Staff Al Alvarez was commissioned. The next day, the New Jersey Legislature announced it would form an investigative panel regarding Murphy's hiring decisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.northjersey.com/story/news/new-jersey/governor/2018/10/17/guide-phil-murphy-scandal-investigations/1662561002/|title=Phil Murphy scandal: What's happening, who's involved and what it means}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Murphy first faced questions about his hiring practices when he selected Marcellus Jackson as an aide in the Department of Education. Jackson had served prison time for taking bribes as a councilman in Passaic County and thus was not allowed to hold public positions. Murphy stood by Jackson, but Jackson was forced to resign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.northjersey.com/story/news/new-jersey/governor/2018/10/17/guide-phil-murphy-scandal-investigations/1662561002/|title=Phil Murphy scandal: What's happening, who's involved and what it means}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Murphy also faces questions about Al Alvarez, who was accused of sexual assault&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-sexual-assault-accusation-in-new-jersey-exposes-a-national-dilemma-1539542172?mod=hp_lead_pos5|title=A Sexual-Assault Accusation in New Jersey Spotlights a National Dilemma}}&lt;/ref&gt; by Katie Brennan, now chief of staff at the state’s housing agency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-sexual-assault-accusation-in-new-jersey-exposes-a-national-dilemma-1539542172?mod=hp_lead_pos5|title=A Sexual-Assault Accusation in New Jersey Spotlights a National Dilemma}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brennan alleged that Alvarez sexually assaulted her in April 2017, after a gathering of Murphy campaign staffers at a bar in Jersey City.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-sexual-assault-accusation-in-new-jersey-exposes-a-national-dilemma-1539542172?mod=hp_lead_pos5|title=A Sexual-Assault Accusation in New Jersey Spotlights a National Dilemma}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alvarez had offered to drive Brennan home and asked to go inside Brennan's home to use the bathroom. Once inside, Alvarez allegedly pushed her on a couch, forced himself on top of her, pulled down Brennan's shirt and put his mouth on her breasts, and shoved his hand down her pants, putting his fingers in her vagina.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-sexual-assault-accusation-in-new-jersey-exposes-a-national-dilemma-1539542172?mod=hp_lead_pos5|title=A Sexual-Assault Accusation in New Jersey Spotlights a National Dilemma}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brennan claims she kicked Alvarez off and locked herself in a bathroom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-sexual-assault-accusation-in-new-jersey-exposes-a-national-dilemma-1539542172?mod=hp_lead_pos5|title=A Sexual-Assault Accusation in New Jersey Spotlights a National Dilemma}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brennan claims she brought her allegations to the Murphy camp three times. The first time was when she alerted the transition team after Murphy won the election in November 2017 while Brennan was working for the transition team. Next, Brennan brought the complaint in March 2018 to Matt Platkin, chief counsel to the governor, who referred the matter to an ethics official in the governor's office. Brennan finally emailed Murphy and his wife on June 1, 2018, saying she wanted to discuss a "sensitive matter." No discussion ever occurred, but Brennan said a campaign attorney told her Alvarez would no longer have a state government job.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nj.com/politics/index.ssf/2018/10/woman_accusing_murphy_staffer_of_sexual_assault_te.html|title=Woman accusing Murphy staffer of rape says she 'received no justice'}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alvarez stayed at his job for about four months after Brennan was told he would be out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nj.com/politics/index.ssf/2018/10/murphy_staffer_accused_of_sexual_assault_remain_on.html|title=Murphy staffer accused of sexual assault stayed in job for months after accuser was told he would be out}}&lt;/ref&gt;

New Jersey Supreme Court Justice Peter Verniero will lead an independent investigation into a "systemic review of the hiring and vetting practices of the governor-elect’s transition office."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.northjersey.com/story/news/new-jersey/governor/2018/10/17/guide-phil-murphy-scandal-investigations/1662561002/|title=Phil Murphy scandal: What's happening, who's involved and what it means}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, New Jersey Senate President Stephen Sweeney will form a six-member, bipartisan committee to investigate the handling of sexual assault allegations against Alvarez, among other issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.northjersey.com/story/news/new-jersey/governor/2018/10/17/guide-phil-murphy-scandal-investigations/1662561002/|title=Phil Murphy scandal: What's happening, who's involved and what it means}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nj.com/politics/index.ssf/2018/10/now_nj_lawmakers_will_investigate_murphy_staffer_sex_assault_scandal.html#incart_push|title=N.J.

==Awards and honors==

'''Qasim Ibrahim''' (also known as ''Buruma Qasim'') is a Maldivian business magnate, [[philanthropist]] and politician. In 1986, Ibrahim founded Villa Shipping and Trading Company Pvt. Ltd, the Maldives largest private conglomerate company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.villahotels.com/About-Villa-Hotels/Company-Profile |title=Company Profile - Villa Hotel Group |publisher=Villahotels.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.villaprojects.net |title=Villa Projects |publisher=Villa Projects |date= |accessdate=2012-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ibrahim is the chairman, and largest shareholder of [[Villa Group]], and is one of the wealthiest businessman in the country. He does his philanthropic activity through Villa Foundation, an philanthropic organisation, which helps Maldivians with health and educational difficulties by offering medical assistance and scholarships.

He ran as the presidential candidate of the [[Jumhooree Party]] in the [[Maldivian presidential election, 2013|2013 elections]], losing the first round.

==Business career==
Ibrahim began his career in 1969 as a clerk at the government hospital in [[Malé]]. In 1973 he left the hospital to work as a manager at M/S Alia Furniture Mart. Subsequently, he worked for Crescent, a trading organisation of the Government, for a short period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.villa.mv |title=Villa - The Leading Business Initiative in Maldives |publisher=Villa.mv |date=2003-02-19 |accessdate=2012-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1974 he joined an outlet of the Maldivian government's Bodu Store, now known as the State Trading Organisation. Two years later, he set up his own trading business in commodities such as rice, tobacco, diesel and kerosene, which proved to be profitable and the business experienced rapid growth. He later expanded his business with a small loan of US$2,000 from [[State Bank of India]] (SBI), which is still his primary banker.

After four years, Ibrahim was able to purchase his first shipping vessel, an old fishing vessel converted to carry cargo and oil, to facilitate oil imports. By April 14, 1986, Ibrahim's business was registered under the name of [[Villa Shipping and Trading Company]] Limited (Villa). Since then, the company has diversified its business with substantial national share in diverse industries such as tourism, transport, construction, manufacturing, Gas, Cement trade, Media and Communication, in addition to general trading, with Sole Distributorships of international products. [[Royal Dutch Shell|Shell]] and [[Agfa]] are among the brand names represented by Villa in the Maldives.&lt;ref name="VillaG" /&gt;

The shareholders of the holding company, Villa Shipping &amp; Trading Company Private Limited (VSTC) are Qasim Ibrahim and one of his wives, Rabia Hussain, holding 95% and 5% respectively. For strategic reasons, Villa Shipping (Singapore) Pte Limited was incorporated in Singapore on December 19, 1991, a 100% subsidiary. The paid up capital by Villa Shipping (Singapore) now stands at S$500,000.&lt;ref name="VillaG"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.villa.mv/industries.html |title=Industries - Villa - The Leading Business Initiative in Maldives |publisher=Villa.mv |date= |accessdate=2012-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 23 July 1997, with the primary objective of promoting Villa resorts. Villa Holidays Touristik GmbH  opened in [[Frankfurt am Main|Frankfurt]], [[Germany]] and was incorporated with a paid-up capital of DM500,000. The company acts as a wholesaler for holiday packages to the Maldives, an agent for sales of hotel rooms, sale of air tickets, and a vehicle for acquiring and trading of tourism related properties and real estate such as hotels and resorts worldwide. It has since become a major subsidiary to promote the Group's own resorts, Fun Island, Paradise Island, Sun Island, Holiday Island and Royal Island.&lt;ref name="Villa Hotels &amp; Resorts"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.villahotels.com |title=Villa Hotels &amp; Resorts |publisher=villahotels.com |date= |accessdate=2012-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Villa Hotels, Tokyo and Villa Hotels, Hong Kong were established in 2001 and 2002 respectively.

Ibrahim has also funded many infrastructure projects in several islands across the archipelago, most notably in developing harbours, construction of schools and mosques. He is currently working on setting up of  a full-fledge General Hospital in Maamigili Island, which will have the first cancer treatments facility in the country.

He also resigned from his position as the Deputy Leader of the [[Dhivehi Rayyithunge Party]] (DRP) on the same day.&lt;ref name="Qasim quits DRP "&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.miadhu.com/2008/07/local-news/qasim-quits-drp-7083|title=Miadhu New (Maldives)|author=|date=2008-07-04|publisher=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://doreview.blogspot.com/2008/07/deputy-leader-of-drp-resigns-from-party.html |title=Dhivehi Observer |publisher=Doreview.blogspot.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ibrahim joined the MDP-led coalition in the second round of the elections, helping [[Mohamed Nasheed]] to secure a historic victory and bring an end to the thirty-year one-man rule of Maumoon Abdul Gayoom. Ibrahim initially joined President Nasheed's government as Minister for Home Affairs but resigned 20 days later,&lt;ref name="Resignation "&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.miadhu.com/2008/12/local-news/resignation-not-shameful-gasim-8650/|title=Miadhu News (Maldives)|author=|date=2008-07-04|publisher=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; citing indifferences in governing policies, especially in relation to Mr. Nasheed's privatisation policies. He since became a vocal opposition to Mr. Nasheed's government and is accused of having funded the anti-Nasheed protests that began in early 2012, ultimately leading to his resignation, after pressure from mutinying police and the army on 7 February 2012.

==Political Activism &amp; Imprisonment==
Ibrahim has been imprisoned on politically motivated cases during Gayoom's regime as well as during Nasheed's brief reign.

He was arrested in 2009 on the suspicion that he was bribing MPs to vote against the government of President Nasheed. He was later released without charge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maldivestoday.com/2010/06/29/hon-qasim-ibrahim-taken-to-dhoonidhoo-detaining-centre/ |title=(Hon) Qasim Ibrahim (MP) has been taken to Dhoonidhoo Detaining Centre |publisher=Maldivestoday.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is currently representing Maamigilee Constituency in [[Parliament of the Maldives|Maldives Parliament]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://minivannews.com/news-in-brief/maamigili-mp-opens-first-private-airport-with-personal-airline-flyme-26370 |title=Maamigili MP opens first private airport with personal airline Flyme  |publisher=[[Minivan News]] |date=2011-10-02 |accessdate=2012-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;
===Imprisonment===
 
Qasim Ibrahim was arrested for speaking against the government on rally held by the ''Maldives United Opposition''. He was  accused of leading a failed bid in March to impeach Speaker [[Abdulla Maseeh Mohamed]], a close ally of president [[Abdulla Yameen]].

==Controversies==
In July 2010, the State Minister for Finance Ahmed Assad stated in a Presidents Office Press Brief that Maldives was facing hurdles in borrowing money because a specific Majlis member was borrowing a large sum of money which in turn was lowering the country’s credit rating. It was stated that this Member has made a request to the government to give him a ‘letter of no objection’ to borrow a further large sum, he said. Though the Minister refused to name the Majlis member at the conference but it is widely assumed in the Maldivian media that the Majlis member is Qasim Ibrahim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://minivannews.com/politics/single-private-borrower-lowers-maldives-credit-rating-assad-8832 |title=Single private borrower lowers Maldives credit rating, and wants to borrow more: Assad |publisher=[[Minivan News]] |date= |accessdate=2013-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2008, the Auditor General submitted a report to the People’s Majlis and issued on the website of the Auditor General’s office, to the effect that Villa Group have been found to be involved in illicit trading of shares.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.miadhu.com/2008/09/local-news/auditor-general-wants-to-prosecute-people-involved-in-mtdc-fraud-7886/ |title=Miadhu News – Auditor General wants to prosecute people involved in MTDC fraud |publisher=Miadhu.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2013, Qasim Ibrahim who is the Parliament’s representative to the Judicial Service Commission (JSC), accused UN Special Rapporteur on Independence of Judges and Lawyers Gabriela Knaul of lying and joking about the state of the Maldivian judiciary. Knaul’s highlighted that the JSC – mandated with the appointment, transfer and removal of judges – was unable to perform its constitutional duty adequately in its current form. Her comment was among a number of preliminary observations on the Maldives’ judiciary and wider legal ecosystem, following an eight-day fact-finding mission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://minivannews.com/politics/jsc-memberpresidential-candidate-gasim-ibrahim-accuses-un-special-rapporteur-of-lying-joking-53790 |title=JSC member/presidential candidate Gasim Ibrahim accuses UN Special Rapporteur of lying, joking |publisher=[[Minivan News]] |date= |accessdate=2013-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Qasim Ibrahim was Finance Minister, controversy reigned regarding the tourism investment by EIB. The European Investment Bank (EIB) has invested €50million to support tourism development 
after the tsunami. According to the ECD in Colombo, there was no co-ordination between EIB  and ECD during the design stage for the loans. Only after ECD reported on indications of misuse of money to EIB were some consultations were held. Overall co-ordination between EIB and ECD is very limited.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oecd.org/countries/maldives/47234192.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Rafic Baha El Deen Al Hariri''' ({{lang-ar|رفيق بهاء الدين الحريري}};  {{IPA-ar|rafiːq ħariːriː}}  1 November 1944 – 14 February 2005) was a [[Lebanon|Lebanese]] business tycoon and the [[Prime Minister of Lebanon]] from 1992 to 1998 and again from 2000 until his resignation on {{end date|2004|10|20|df=yes}}.
&lt;!--Life: Political and business action --&gt;
He headed five cabinets during his tenure. Hariri dominated the country's post-war political and business life and is widely credited with reconstructing the capital [[Beirut]] after the [[Lebanese Civil War|15-year civil war]].

&lt;!-- Assassination --&gt;
Hariri was assassinated on 14 February 2005 by a suicide truck bomb in Beirut. Four Hezbollah members were indicted for the assassination and are currently being tried ''[[Trial in absentia|in absentia]]'' by the [[Special Tribunal for Lebanon]], but others have linked the assassination to the [[Syria]]n government.

&lt;!-- Consequences --&gt;
[[Assassination of Rafic Hariri|Hariri's assassination]] was a catalyst for dramatic political change in Lebanon. The massive protests of the [[Cedar Revolution]] helped achieve the withdrawal of Syrian troops and security forces from Lebanon, and a change in governments.

==Early life and education==
Hariri was born on 1 November 1944 to a modest [[Sunni Islam in Lebanon|Sunni Muslim]] family in the Lebanese port city of [[Sidon]]. He had two siblings (brother Shafic and sister [[Bahia Hariri|Bahia]])&lt;ref name=Foundation/&gt; He attended elementary and secondary school in Sidon,&lt;ref name=Foundation/&gt; and graduated in business administration from [[Beirut Arab University]].&lt;ref name="Rafik Hariri NYT"/&gt;

==Career==

In 1965, Hariri went to [[Saudi Arabia]] to work.&lt;ref name="Rafik Hariri NYT"/&gt; There, he taught for a short period of time before shifting to the construction industry.&lt;ref name="Rafik Hariri, Ex-Premier of Lebanon, Dies at 60"/&gt; In 1978, he gained [[Saudi Arabian nationality law|Saudi Arabian citizenship]],&lt;ref name="Rafik Hariri NYT"/&gt;&lt;ref name=gary2001july&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gambill|first=Gary C.|author2=Ziad K. Abdelnour |title=Dossier: Rafiq Hariri|journal=[[Middle East Intelligence Bulletin]]|date=July 2001|volume=3|issue=7|url=http://www.meforum.org/meib/articles/0107_ld1.htm|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140508004255/http://www.meforum.org/meib/articles/0107_ld1.htm|archivedate= {{Date|2014-5-8}} }}&lt;/ref&gt; in addition to his [[Lebanese nationality law|Lebanese citizenship]].

In 1969, Hariri established Ciconest, a small subcontracting firm, which soon went out of business. He then went in business with the French construction firm Oger for the construction of a hotel in [[Ta’if]], [[Saudi Arabia]], the timely construction of which earned praise from [[King Khaled]]. Hariri took over Oger, forming [[Saudi Oger]], which became the main construction firm used by the [[Saudi Royal family]] for all their important developments. As a result, a few years after his first contract with King Khaled, Hariri had become a multi-billionaire.

{{Politics of Lebanon}}
Having accumulated his wealth, Hariri started a number of philanthropic projects, including the building of educational facilities in Lebanon. His first initiative in Lebanon was the Islamic Association for Culture and Education, which he founded in 1979.&lt;ref name=mermay&gt;{{cite journal|title=Lebanon’s Politics: The Sunni Community and Hariri’s Future Current|journal=[[Middle East Report]]|date=26 May 2010|issue=96|url=http://www.crisisgroup.org/~/media/Files/Middle%20East%20North%20Africa/Iraq%20Syria%20Lebanon/Lebanon/96%20Lebanons%20Politics%20-%20The%20Sunni%20Community%20and%20Hariris%20Future%20Current.ashx|accessdate=22 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The association was later renamed the Hariri Foundation.&lt;ref name=mermay/&gt; Hariri became progressively more embroiled in politics. His appeals to the United Nations and services as an emissary to the Saudi Royal family won him international recognition on the political stage for his humanitarian efforts.

In 1982, Hariri donated $12 million to Lebanese victims of the [[1978 South Lebanon conflict]] and helped clean up Beirut's streets with his company's money and contributed to early reconstruction efforts during lulls in the Lebanon war. Said to have heavily financed opposing militias during the war, his former deputy [[Najah Wakim]] later accused him of helping to destroy downtown Beirut in order to rebuild it again and make billions of dollars in the process.&lt;ref name=gary2001july/&gt; After the conflict, he acted as an envoy of the [[House of Saud|Saudi royal family]] to Lebanon. He laid the groundwork that led to the 1989 [[Taif Accord]], which Saudi Arabia organised to bring the warring factions together. Taif put an end to the [[Lebanese civil war|civil war]], building goodwill for Hariri politically. While acting as the Saudi envoy to Lebanon, he spent more time in Damascus than in Beirut where he ingratiated himself with the [[Assad regime]]; he had a new presidential palace built in Damascus as a gift to the Syrian dictator but Assad didn't use it personally.&lt;ref name=gary2001july/&gt;

==Political career==
Hariri returned to Lebanon in the early 1980s as a wealthy man and began to build a name for himself by making large donations and contributions to various groups in Lebanon. However, he continued to serve as a political advisor to [[Prince Bandar bin Sultan]] in 1983.&lt;ref name=saad9july&gt;{{cite news|last=Mehio|first=Saad|title=Prime Minister Alwaleed bin Talal?

As a former Saudi diplomatic representative, he played a significant role in constructing [[Taif Agreement|the 1990 Taif Agreement]] that ended Lebanon's sixteen-year civil war.&lt;ref name=neal&gt;{{cite journal|last=Neal|first=Mark W.|author2=Richard Tansey |title=The dynamics of effective corrupt leadership: Lessons from Rafik Hariri's political career in Lebanon|journal=The Leadership Quarterly|year=2010|volume=21|pages=33–49|url=http://www.democracyinlebanon.com/Documents/CDL-World/CorruptEffectiveLeadership(HaririinLebanon).pdf|accessdate=10 June 2012|doi=10.1016/j.leaqua.2009.10.003}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1992, Hariri became the first post-civil war prime minister of Lebanon under president [[Elias Hrawi]].&lt;ref name=mer&gt;{{cite book|title=Middle East Review|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NYszJtC66FAC&amp;pg=PA113|accessdate=19 March 2013|publisher=Kogan Page Publishers|isbn=978-0-7494-4066-4|pages=113}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=are2007&gt;{{cite journal|last=Knudsen|first=Are|title=The Law, the Loss and the Lives of Palestinian Refugees in Lebanon|journal=CMI|year=2007|volume=1|url=http://bora.cmi.no/dspace/bitstream/10202/24/1/WP%202007-1.pdf|accessdate=20 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hariri put the country back on the financial map through the issuing of [[Eurobond]]s and won plaudits from the [[World Bank]] for his plan to borrow reconstruction money as the country's debt grew to become the largest per capita in the world. His first premiership lasted until 1998, and Hariri was replaced by [[Salim Hoss]] as prime minister.&lt;ref name=gary2001july/&gt;&lt;ref name=mer/&gt; In fact, as a result of the power struggle between Hariri and newly elected president [[Émile Lahoud]], he left office.&lt;ref name=fakih23feb&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fakih|first=Mohalhel|title=A city mourns|journal=Al Ahram Weekly|date=17–23 February 2005|volume=730|url=http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2005/730/re21.htm|accessdate=15 April 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130325062137/http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2005/730/re21.htm|archivedate=25 March 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== 1992–1998 economic political policies ==
[[File:Rafiq Hariri's former residence in Paris, 2011.jpg|thumbnail|Rafic Hariri's former residence in Paris]]
Hariri implemented an aggressive new economic policy. Perhaps Hariri's most important creation in the beginning of his career was "Horizon 2000" the government's name for its new rejuvenation plan. A large component of "Horizon 2000" was [[Solidere]], the privately owned&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.solidere.com/solidere.html |title='&amp;#39;About Solidere'&amp;#39; |publisher=Solidere.com |accessdate=4 July 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130116054209/http://www.solidere.com/solidere.html |archivedate=16 January 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; construction company that was established to reconstruct post-war Lebanon. Solidere was owned by the government and private investors. Solidere was largely focused on redeveloping Beirut's downtown and turning it into a new urban center as quickly as possible as one aspect of the various infrastructure redevelopment plans that would be implemented by "Horizon 2000". Another aspect of the decade-long plan was the privatization of major industries. Numerous contracts were awarded in important industries such as energy, telecommunications, electricity, airports and roads.

The last and perhaps most significant aspect of "Horizon 2000" was economic stimulus via foreign direct investment. Specifically, Hariri supported foreign firms and individuals taking an interest in Lebanon's developmental potential. Hariri simplified tax codes and provided tax breaks to foreign investors. Due to his previous successes in the private sector and the numerous resulting international connections, Hariri was able to garner a significant amount of low-interest loans from foreign investors. Hariri also pursued aggressive macroeconomic policy such as maintaining strict regulations on bank reserves and inter-bank interest rates to curb inflation and raise the value of the Lebanese pound relative to the dollar.

Hariri's economic policies were a remarkable success during his first year in office. From 1992 to 1993 there was a 6 percent increase in real national income, the capital base of commercial banks effectively doubled, the budgetary earnings hovered at around a billion dollars, and commercial banks’ consolidated balance sheets increased about 25%. By 1998, however, real GDP growth was around 1%, a year later it would be -1%, national debt had skyrocketed 540% from two to eighteen billion dollars, Lebanon's economy was in a miserable state.

== Hariri and Lebanon's political environment ==

Amid the political crisis brought on by the extension of President [[Émile Lahoud]]'s term, Hariri resigned as Prime Minister, saying: "I have... submitted the resignation of the government, and I have declared that I will not be a candidate to head the (next) government."

During a BBC interview in 2001,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/article8295.htm|title=BBC Interview With Rafiq Hariri'|work=Information clearing house|accessdate=4 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/hardtalk/4270601.stm|title=Rafiq Hariri'|work=BBC News|date=16 February 2005|accessdate=4 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Harīrī was asked by [[Tim Sebastian]] why he refused to hand over members of [[Hezbollah]] that were accused by America of being terrorists. He responded that Hezbollah were the ones protecting Lebanon against the Israeli occupation and called for implementation of passed United Nations resolutions against Israel. He was further accused of making the American coalition in the [[War on Terrorism|war on terrorism]] worthless and asked if he was ready for the consequences of his refusal, reminding him that [[George W. Bush]] had said: "Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.iran-press-service.com/articles_2001/sep_2001/bush_congress_address_21901.htm|title="You Are Either With Us Or With The Terrorists", President Bush Warns|work=Iran press service|accessdate=4 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He replied that he had hoped there would be no consequences, but would deal with them if they arrive. Hariri further said that he opposed the killing of all humans – Israeli, Palestinian, Syrian or Lebanese – and believed in dialogue as a solution. He further went on to say that Syria would have to stay in Lebanon for protection of Lebanon until they are no longer needed and Lebanon asks them to leave.

Lebanese [[Druze]] leader [[Walid Jumblatt]], a recent recruit of the anti-Syrian opposition, emboldened by popular anger and civic action now being called Lebanon's [[Cedar Revolution]], alleged in the wake of the assassination that on 26 August 2004 Syrian President [[Bashar al-Assad]] threatened Hariri, saying "&lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;President of Lebanon&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; Lahoud is me. ...

On 22 June 2005, Beirut International Airport was renamed [[Beirut–Rafic Hariri International Airport|Rafic Hariri International Airport]].&lt;ref name= "Foundation"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rhf.org.lb/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=9&amp;Itemid=12|title=Rafiq Al Hariri's biography|work=Rafiq Hariri Foundation|accessdate=1 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, Beirut General University hospital was renamed Rafiq Hariri Hospital.&lt;ref name = "Foundation"/&gt; Rafic Hariri was succeeded by his son [[Saad Hariri]] as leader of the Future Party.

===Corruption===
Hariri was considered as the principal actor in the widespread corruption that plagued Lebanon during the [[Syrian occupation of Lebanon|Syrian occupation]]. His wealth grew from less than $1 billion when he was appointed prime minister in 1992, to over $16 billion when he died. The Company for the Development and Reconstruction of Beirut's Central District, known as [[Solidere]], in which Hariri is the primary shareholder, expropriated most property in the [[Beirut Central District|central business district]] of Beirut, compensating each owner with shares in the company, were worth as little as 15% of the property's value. That Hariri and his business associates profited immensely from this project was an open secret.&lt;ref name="Lebanon's vast web of corruption unravels"/&gt;&lt;ref name="corruption-nation"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thenation.com/doc/20070305/ciezadlo|archiveurl=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20090701151610/http%3A//www%2Ethenation%2Ecom/doc/20070305/ciezadlo |archivedate= 1 July 2009 |title=Sect Symbols|last=Ciezadlo|first=Annia|date=24 February 2007|newspaper=The Nation|accessdate=25 June 2011|location=New York City}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hariri and his protégés were not the only beneficiaries of this spending spree. In order to secure support from militia chieftains, and pro-Syrian ideologues that Damascus had installed in the government, Hariri allowed kickbacks from public spending to enrich all major government figures. Contracts for the import of petroleum were awarded to the two sons of President [[Elias Hrawi]].&lt;ref name="Lebanon's vast web of corruption unravels"/&gt;&lt;ref name="corruption-nation"/&gt;	

As result of the growing criticism and popular discontent with Hariri's policies, the government banned public demonstrations in 1994 and relied upon the [[Lebanese Army|Army]] to enforce the decree.&lt;ref name="Lebanon's vast web of corruption unravels"/&gt;&lt;ref name="corruption-nation"/&gt; In return for a relatively free hand in economic matters, Hariri cooperated with Syria's drive to consolidate its control over Lebanon. Under the guise of "regulating" the audiovisual media, the government placed control of all major television and radio stations in the hands of pro-Syrian elites. Supporters of [[Michel Aoun]] were also perpetually harassed and detained.&lt;ref name="Lebanon's vast web of corruption unravels"/&gt;&lt;ref name="corruption-nation"/&gt;

==Personal life==
Hariri married twice. He had seven children. In 1965, he married an Iraqi woman, Nidal Bustani, who is the mother of his three sons; [[Bahaa Hariri|Bahaa]] (born 1967), who is a businessman, [[Saad Hariri|Saad]], who succeeded his father as leader of the future movement, and Houssam—who died in a traffic accident in the US in the late 1980s.&lt;ref name=medpol/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last= Fisk|first= Robert| authorlink =Robert Fisk|title= Syria mourns death of a 'golden son'|url= https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/syria-mourns-death-of-a-golden-son-basil-assads-fatal-car-crash-throws-open-the-question-of-who-will-succeed-the-president-writes-robert-fisk-in-beirut-1408555.html|archiveurl= https://archive.is/20130826221018/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/syria-mourns-death-of-a-golden-son-basil-assads-fatal-car-crash-throws-open-the-question-of-who-will-succeed-the-president-writes-robert-fisk-in-beirut-1408555.html|archivedate=26 August 2013|newspaper=The Independent|date=22 January 1994|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; They divorced.

From 1982 until his death Hariri owned [[2–8a Rutland Gate]] a large house in [[London]]'s [[Knightsbridge]] district. The house was gifted to the [[Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia]], [[Sultan bin Abdulaziz]], after Hariri's assassination.&lt;ref name=FTSep12&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/d6f7ea5a-fcca-11e1-9dd2-00144feabdc0.html|title=Hyde Park mansion on sale for £300 million|author=Ed Hammond and Sally Gainsbury|date=12 September 2012|work=[[The Financial Times]]|accessdate=28 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 14 February 2005, Hariri was killed when explosives equivalent to around {{convert|1800|kg}} of [[trinitrotoluene|TNT]] concealed inside a parked [[Mitsubishi]] van were detonated&lt;ref name="erikmitzi"/&gt; as his [[motorcade]] drove near the St. George Hotel in Beirut.&lt;ref name=edge&gt;{{cite web|last=Edge|first=Tim|title=Death of a Martyr|url=http://www2.gwu.edu/~uwp/fyw/euonymous/2005-2006/06-edgefinal.pdf|publisher=GWU|accessdate=24 March 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6IJGu6l0i?url=http://www2.gwu.edu/~uwp/fyw/euonymous/2005-2006/06-edgefinal.pdf|archivedate=22 July 2013|df=dmy-all}}&amp;nbsp;&lt;/ref&gt; Another 22 people lost their lives in the explosion.&lt;ref name="Anniversary of Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri's Assassination"/&gt; Among the dead were several of Hariri's bodyguards and his friend and former Minister of the Economy [[Bassel Fleihan]]. Hariri was buried along with his bodyguards, who died in the bombing, in a location near [[Mohammad Al-Amin Mosque]].

A 2006 report by [[Serge Brammertz]] indicated that [[DNA]] evidence collected from the crime scene suggests that the assassination might be the act of a young male [[suicide bomber]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UN probe into murder of former Lebanese leader nears sensitive stage – inquiry chief|publisher=UN|date={{Date|2006-12-18}}|url=https://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=21034&amp;Cr=leban&amp;Cr1=|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6IJH4qcEX?url=http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=21034&amp;Cr=leban&amp;Cr1=|archivedate=22 July 2013|deadurl=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
{{Main|Cedar Revolution}}
Hariri was well regarded among international leaders, for example, he was a close friend of [[French President]] [[Jacques Chirac]]. Chirac was one of the first foreign dignitaries to offer condolences to Hariri's widow in person at her home in Beirut. [[Special Tribunal for Lebanon|The Special Tribunal for Lebanon]] was also created at his instigation. Syria was initially accused of the assassination, which led to the withdrawal of Syrian troops from Lebanon following widespread protests.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

Hezbollah accused Israel of the assassination of Hariri. According to Hezbollah officials, the assassination of Hariri was planned by the Mossad as a means of expelling the Syrian army from Lebanon. In August 2010, Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah presented evidence, consisting of intercepted Israeli spy-drone video footage, which he said implicated Israel in the assassination of Hariri.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.cnn.com/2010-08-09/world/lebanon.nasrallah.israel_1_hezbollah-leader-hassan-nasrallah-israelis?_s=PM:WORLD Hezbollah chief: Israel killed Hariri] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130116235714/http://articles.cnn.com/2010-08-09/world/lebanon.nasrallah.israel_1_hezbollah-leader-hassan-nasrallah-israelis?_s=PM%3AWORLD |date=16 January 2013}}, CNN&lt;/ref&gt; After an altercation between male Tribunal staff and women at a gynecology clinic in October 2010, Hezbollah demanded that the Lebanese government stop all cooperation with the [[Special Tribunal for Lebanon|Special Tribunal]], claiming the tribunal to be an infringement on Lebanese sovereignty by western governments. On 1 November 2010, a report was leaked by ''[[Al-Akhbar (Lebanon)|Al Akhbar]]'', a local secular, leftist newspaper, stating that Hezbollah drafted plans for a quick takeover of the country in the case an indictment against its members is issued by the [[Special Tribunal for Lebanon|UN Special Tribunal]].&lt;ref&gt;* [http://www.stratfor.com/memberships/175137/analysis/20101102_hezbollah_threatens_explosion_beirut_over_tribunal Hezbollah Threatens an 'Explosion' in Beirut Over Tribunal] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101106081720/http://www.stratfor.com/memberships/175137/analysis/20101102_hezbollah_threatens_explosion_beirut_over_tribunal |date=6 November 2010 }}, Stratfor Global Intelligence.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1378">{{Refimprove|date=September 2011}}'''Real-time enterprise''' (commonly abbreviated to '''RTE''') is a concept in business systems design focused on ensuring organisational responsiveness that was popularised in the first decade of the 21st century. It is also referred to as on-demand enterprise. Such an enterprise must be able to fulfill orders as soon as they are needed.

Though not particularly well defined, generally accepted goals of an RTE include:
*Reduced response times for partners and customers
*Increased transparency, for example sharing or reporting information across an enterprise instead of keeping it within individual departments
*Increased automation, including communications, accounting, supply chains and reporting
*Increased competitiveness
*Reduced costs.

'''Robert L. Genillard''', (15 June 1929 – 18 September 2016), was a Swiss businessman.  His activities spanned both the fields of finance and industry. After graduate studies in economics and finance, he started a financial career in [[New York City]]. In 1954, he joined [[White Weld &amp; Co.]], one of the oldest and leading American investment banking firms, acquired by [[Merrill Lynch]] in 1977. He became a general partner of White, Weld &amp; Co.in 1958 and a member of its Management Committee in 1964. He moved to Europe to establish in the early 1960s, as chairman and chief executive, the firm of Credit Suisse White Weld which was to become [[Credit Suisse First Boston]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.finews.ch/news/banken/24520-credit-suisse-white-weld-investmentbanking-robert-genillard-rainer-e-gut-rudloff-gruebel|title=Investmentbanker Robert Genillard verstorben|work=finews.ch|accessdate=22 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Genillard was born in born in [[Lausanne]] in 1929&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.ca/books?id=AM0JW06Ek7EC&amp;q=%22Genillard,+RObert%22+1929&amp;dq=%22Genillard,+RObert%22+1929&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwil56Sro6TPAhWM44MKHUHpB4QQ6AEIIDAB]&lt;/ref&gt; He is regarded as one of the main architects and developers of the Eurocapital market( [[Eurobond]]) in which the firm he led played a dominant role. His professional writings and accomplishments have been widely published.

He forecast that the Eurobond market would become the Supranational Capital market. This was again demonstrated in 2016 when an international syndicate of Banks floated a $42billion issue of bonds for Anheuser Bush Inbev. A private company, for which they received $112billion in subscritions. No single Capital market could have competed. 

During the last twenty years,  Genillard has also been quite active in industry, notably with ties to the [[Thyssen-Bornemisza Group]], an industrial employing some 20.000 people worldwide at the time, having led the parent company, TBG Holdings N.V. as its Chief Executive from 1977 to 1983,  and having served as Deputy Chairman of its Supervisory Board between 1971 and 1994.
Since 1983, his principal activity has been as an independent corporate director and investor. He has served as a director or advisor on the boards of various companies of international significance, among which [[Alusuisse]] (Vice-Chairman), [[American Express]]{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} 
Company, Cabot Corporation International Board, Clariden Bank ( Later Clariden Leu) (Founder-Chairman – Honorary Chairman), Compagnie des Machines Bull, Credit Suisse Group (Vice-Chairman), Credit Suisse[2] (Vice-Chairman), Credit Suisse First Boston (Vice-Chairman), Corning Inc. (now Director Emeritus), Honeywell International, Novartis, and Société des Bains de Mer (SBM). Geinllard died on 18 September 2016 at the age of 87.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.finews.ch/news/banken/24520-credit-suisse-white-weld-investmentbanking-robert-genillard-rainer-e-gut-rudloff-gruebel&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Solomon Loeb''' (June 29, 1828 – December 12, 1903) was a [[Germany|German]]-born American banker and businessman. He was a [[merchant]] in [[textiles]] and later a [[banker]] with [[Kuhn, Loeb &amp; Co.]]

==Biography==
His father, a devout [[Ashkenazi Jew|Jew]], had been a small corn- and wine-dealer in Worms, which belonged to the [[Grand Duchy of Hesse and by Rhine]]. Solomon Loeb immigrated to the United States in 1849.  He settled in [[Cincinnati]] with the textiles merchant Kuhn, Netter &amp; Co. He moved to [[New York City]] in 1865 and with his partner, [[Abraham Kuhn (banker)|Abraham Kuhn]], started the banking house of [[Kuhn, Loeb and Co.]]  His second born son, [[James Loeb]], joined the bank in 1888 (and left in 1901). Solomon Loeb gradually retired from running the business but left Kuhn, Loeb &amp; Co. only in 1899. He then started to move into the real estate business. In addition, he was also a generous [[philanthropist]].

Among his donations was the Hebrew Charities Building that formerly stood at Second Avenue and 21st Street in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;"Hebrew Charities Building&amp;mdash;The Gift of Solomon Loeb to Jewish Charity Dedicated&amp;mdash;Mr. Rice Appeals for Endowment Fund", ''New York Times'', May 19, 1899, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1450">A '''strike suit''' is a [[lawsuit]] brought by a single person or group of people with the purpose of gaining a private settlement before going to court that would be less than the cost of the defendant's legal costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;  Such suits frequently appear where the [[defendant]] is a considerably larger entity than the [[plaintiff]], such as a corporation or an estate.

==Strike suits in Securities Law==
Company shareholders sometimes use strike suits as a means of addressing perceived failures by or discontentment with the company while avoiding becoming embroiled in litigation themselves.

*A minor shareholder sues a company for falling short on projected earnings.  The lawsuit makes multiple technical claims of incompetence by the company.
*A minor shareholder sues a company for failure to follow bylaws set by the company.  The lawsuit makes multiple technical claims of bylaw infractions by the company.

==Base of the pyramid and the William Davidson Institute==

London is vice president of the Scaling Impact Initiative and a senior research fellow at the [[William Davidson Institute]]. The Scaling Impact Initiative champions innovative ways of thinking about building better enterprises for BoP markets, with a particular focus on developing strategies and frameworks that enable enterprise leaders better navigate the journey to sustainability at scale.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wdi.umich.edu/people/ted-london/ William Davidson Institute]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academic experience and research==

London received his [[PhD]] in [[strategic management]] from the [[Kenan-Flagler Business School]] at the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]] (UNC). He was also an assistant professor of entrepreneurship, teaching strategic management, international business and poverty alleviation, and sustainable enterprise at UNC.

At UNC, London was the director of the BoP Learning Laboratory a consortium of companies, nonprofit organizations, multilateral institutions and academics that explores the opportunities and challenges associated with entering Base of the Pyramid markets.

London’s research interests center on business and development strategies in low income markets, assessment of poverty alleviation impacts, and capability development for cross-sector collaborations.   He has received awards and recognition for his research, teaching, and case writing, including winning the oikos Sustainability Case Writing Competition in 2005 and 2008, the Page Prize in 2011, the Samsung Best Paper Award in 2010, and the Doug Nigh Award in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://oikos-international.org/publications/building-a-sustainable-venture-from-the-ground-up-the-mountains-institutes-earth-brick-machine/ Oikos Case Programme Site 2005]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://oikos-international.org/publications/scojo-foundation/ Oikos Case Programme Site 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://moore.sc.edu/about/sustainableenterprisedevelopment/pageprize/pageprize2011.aspx Page Prize Award]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://divtest.aom.org/im/recent-awards-winners/ Samsung Best Paper Award]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://divtest.aom.org/im/recent-awards-winners/ Doug Nigh Award]&lt;/ref&gt;

London’s work has been published in a number of academic and practitioner journals, and he has written several book chapters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://michiganross.umich.edu/faculty-research/faculty/ted-london University of Michigan: Ted London Biographical Page]&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2009, the Harvard Business Review published London's paper entitled "Making Better Investments at the Base of the Pyramid". The article introduces London's Base of the Pyramid Impact Assessment Framework, a tool used to explore how ventures influence the well-being of local buyers, sellers, and communities. The Impact Assessment Framework guides managers through a detailed look at an organization's effects on those constituencies in three areas: economics, capabilities, and relationships.&lt;ref&gt;[https://hbr.org/2009/05/making-better-investments-at-the-base-of-the-pyramid Harvard Business Review Article]&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 2010, ''Next Generation Business Strategies for the Base of the Pyramid: New Approaches for Building Mutual Value'' was published.&lt;ref&gt;[https://nextgenerationbop.com/ Next Generation Business Strategies Book Site]&lt;/ref&gt;  Co-editors, London and [[Stuart L. Hart]], along with nine other leading BoP thought and practice leaders, focus on second-generation BoP innovations, techniques and business models that create value with the BoP. They identify ways to conceptualize opportunities, create sustainable business ecosystems, design new technologies with BoP in mind, and even transform entire sectors through collaborative entrepreneurship.

In 2012, WDI team members London and Ravi Anupindi published an article entitled "Using the base-of-the-pyramid perspective to catalyze interdependence-based collaborations." This article argues that in order for both donor- and enterprise-led value chain initiatives to be both scalable and sustainable, a BoP perspective must be taken so that development and business efforts are better integrated.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pnas.org/content/109/31/12338.full.pdf 2012 London and Anupindi Article]&lt;/ref&gt; The article’s research was funded by [[USAID]] and the [[Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation]].

In 2015, London wrote a book entitled  ''The Base of the Pyramid Promise'', which was published in early 2016.

London also has consulted for a variety of companies, non-profit organizations, and multilateral institutions in Africa, Asia, Latin America, Europe, and the U.S.. This has involved exploring entry into base of the pyramid markets, examining cross-sector alliances between companies and non-profit organizations, and assessing poverty alleviation implications of BoP ventures.  He also serves on advisory boards for [[VisionSpring]] (formerly Scojo Foundation),  NextBillion, the [[United Nations Development Programme]] (UNDP), and the Sasakawa Peace Foundation.

==Professional experience==
London was a [[design engineer]] for [[General Motors]] after graduating from [[Lehigh University]] in 1985 with a [[Bachelor of Science|BS]] in [[Mechanical Engineering]]. A few years later he received his MBA from the Peter Drucker Graduate Management Center at [[Claremont Graduate University]] and went to work for Deloitte, Haskins &amp; Sells as a senior consultant in [[business valuation]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://wdi.umich.edu/people/ted-london/ William Davidson Institute]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989 London joined the [[Peace Corps]] in Africa and co-managed a regional business development program in [[Malawi]].{{cn|date=July 2016}} Three years later, he was in Asia serving as general manager for an [[Indonesia]]n joint venture operated by McCormick Spices.{{cn|date=July 2016}}

In 1993, London served as a director of a multi-country initiative in the Asia/Pacific Region that linked income generation and environmental protection for Conservation International.{{cn|date=July 2016}}

Three years later, London became executive director of a non-profit providing business development services to companies in Northern Virginia before pursuing his [[PhD]] at [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://michiganross.umich.edu/faculty-research/faculty/ted-london See CV at University of Michigan Ross School of Business Site]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Uriel Lynn''' ({{lang-he|אוריאל לין}}, born 2 April 1935) is an [[Israel]]i lawyer, former civil servant and politician. Currently president of the Federation of the Israeli Chambers of Commerce and the Tel Aviv and Central Israel Chamber of Commerce, he served as a member of the [[Knesset]] for [[Likud]] between 1984 and 1992.

==Biography==
Lynn was born '''Uriel Asulin''' in [[Jerusalem]] during the [[Mandatory Palestine|Mandate era]]. His father, Yehonatan Asulin was from [[Morocco]], while his mother, Margalit Hazan, was born in Palestine. His grandfather, rabbi Ben-Zion Mordechai Hazan, was one of the founders of the [[Porat Yosef Yeshiva]] in [[Jerusalem]], and officially handed over the [[Old City (Jerusalem)|Old City]] of Jerusalem to the Jordanians during the Israeli surrender there in the [[1948 Arab-Israeli War]]. Lynn attended the Nautical School in [[Haifa]]. He served in the [[7th Armored Brigade (Israel)|7th Armored Brigade]] of the [[Israel Defense Forces]], and fought as a reservist in the [[Suez Crisis]], [[Six-Day War]], and [[Yom Kippur War]]. and afterwards studied law at the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]] and [[University of California, Berkeley]],&lt;ref name=P&gt;[https://www.knesset.gov.il/mk/eng/mk_eng.asp?mk_individual_id_t=484 Uriel Lynn: Particulars] Knesset website&lt;/ref&gt; earning an LLM from both universities. He was certified as a lawyer devoting two years in litigation of cases related to traffic accidents and from 1965 until 1970 worked as secretary and legal advisor at the ATA textile company.&lt;ref name=PA&gt;[https://www.knesset.gov.il/mk/eng/mk_eng.asp?mk_individual_id_t=484 Uriel Lynn: Public activities] Knesset website&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1969 and 1971 he worked as deputy general manager at Isranyl, a textile factory, which later on was transformed to Jerusalem Jersey Textile where he continued working as managing director between 1972 and 1979.&lt;ref name=PA/&gt;

In 1973 Lynn joined the [[Liberal Party (Israel)|Liberal Party]], which was part of the [[Likud]] alliance. He was placed 56th on the Likud list for the [[Israeli legislative election, 1977|1977 Knesset elections]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.idi.org.il/media/513522/%D7%9B%D7%A0%D7%A1%D7%AA%209-%20%D7%94%D7%9C%D7%99%D7%9B%D7%95%D7%93.pdf Likud list (1977)] Israel Democracy Institute&lt;/ref&gt; but failed to win a seat. In 1978, following Likud's election victory, Lynn became a civil servant after being appointed Director of the North American Investment Authority. In 1982 he became Director General of the [[Ministry of National Infrastructures, Energy and Water Resources|Ministry of Energy and Infrastructure]].&lt;ref name=PA/&gt;

In [[Israeli legislative election, 1984|1984]] Lynn was elected to the Knesset on the Likud list. He was appointed chairman of the Subcommittee on Energy and of the Subcommittee for Road Safety, and also chaired the Parliamentary Inquiry Committee for Traffic Accidents.&lt;ref name=KA&gt;[https://www.knesset.gov.il/mk/eng/mk_eng.asp?mk_individual_id_t=484 Uriel Lynn: Knesset activities] Knesset website&lt;/ref&gt;

He was re-elected in the [[Israeli legislative election, 1988|1988 elections]] after being placed 23rd on the Likud list.&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.idi.org.il/media/512130/%D7%9B%D7%A0%D7%A1%D7%AA%2012-%20%D7%94%D7%9C%D7%99%D7%9B%D7%95%D7%93.pdf Likud list (1988)] Israel Democracy Institute&lt;/ref&gt; In his second term in the Knesset he chaired the Constitution, Law and Justice Committee till 1992.&lt;ref name=KA/&gt;

In 1992 he decided not to run again as candidate to the Israeli Knesset, and established again his own law firm,&lt;ref name=PA/&gt; specializing in arbitration and  government.

At the end of 2002 he was elected President of the Tel Aviv &amp; Central Israel Chamber of Commerce and of the Federation of Israeli Chambers of Commerce. He also became a member of the board of the [[Eurochambres]] and was elected a member of the council of the World Chambers Federation (WCF), a worldwide organization of National Chambers of Commerce.

'''Vaughan Metropolitan Centre''' is the {{convert|125|acre|ha|adj=on|order=flip}} [[central business district]], currently being developed at the intersection of [[Ontario Highway 400|Highway 400]] and [[York Regional Road 7|Highway 7]], in [[Vaughan, Ontario]], Canada, in the area often seen as being part of the historic communities of either [[Edgeley, Ontario|Edgeley]] or [[Concord, Ontario|Concord]]. It is served by the [[Vaughan Metropolitan Centre station|Vaughan Metropolitan Centre subway station]], which is the northern terminus of the western leg of [[Line 1 Yonge–University]] of the [[Toronto subway]] system, which connects to [[York Region Transit]] (YRT) and [[Viva Rapid Transit|Viva]] bus rapid transit services.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = First Look: New TTC Map - Vaughan Metropolitan Centre|url = http://www.vaughanmetrocentre.ca/ttc-map/|website = Vaughan Metropolitan Centre|accessdate = 2015-12-03|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Name==
In the summer of 2009, Vaughan's city council announced that they wanted public submissions to suggest a new name for Vaughan's new downtown core. At the time, it was known as "Vaughan Corporate Centre", but the name change was suggested so that the name would "better reflect the true vision and future of this key hub".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120117064807/http://www.vivanext.com/blog/2009/09/09/and-the-new-name-is%E2%80%A6/|title=And the new name is… « vivaNext|date=2012-01-17|access-date=2018-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nearly 1,600 entries were submitted; the subcommittee (chaired by Ward 4 Councillor Sandra Yeung Racco) decided on the name of "Vaughan Metropolitan Centre" for the area.

==Background==
[[File:Wal-Mart Supercenter in Vaughan, Ontario, Canada, Jan 2008.jpg|thumb|left|This Wal-Mart Supercenter will eventually be absorbed into the VMC]]
Mitch Goldhar has owned the 100-acre site since the mid-1990s; 40 acres of it are now owned by developers Rudy Bratty and Silvio DeGasperis, and the remainder by Goldhar’s firms, including [[SmartCentres]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/rob-magazine/mr-smartcentres-mitch-goldhar-gives-canadians-what-they-want/article559464/?page=all|title=Mr. SmartCentres, Mitch Goldhar, gives Canadians what they want|access-date=2018-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Prominent businesses having property in the Centre include Toromont, [[Wal-Mart]], [[AMC Theatres]], [[Lowe's]], and [[Future Shop]]. [[Sam's Club]] had been located there before it closed down in March 2009. Two hotels operated by [[Marriott International|Marriott]] and one by [[Hilton Hotels Corporation|Hilton]], are also located at the Centre, as well as a Monte Carlo Inn. The core of the centre is approximately 1 km long (west to east) and 400m wide (north to south), although the plans for the Centre also include lands immediately outside this core zone.

==Development==
[[File:VMC KPMG building 2018.jpg|thumb|left|100 New Park Place was opened in 2017 as the first major commercial development on the site. The grounds were designed by [[Claude Cormier]].]][[File:Vaughan_station_exterior.jpg|thumb|Main entrance building of Vaughan Metropolitan Centre subway station]] 
 

Vaughan plans to build a city centre from scratch around the Vaughan Metropolitan Centre subway station in a 179 hectare site that prior to the station's opening was low density featuring big box stores such as Walmart. By 2012, the city had already purchased land around VMC Station for development. Vaughan projects that by 2031, the new downtown will have 25,000 residents and employment for more than 11,000 people.&lt;ref name=TheStar-2012-04-06&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2012/04/06/torontos_subway_brings_downtown_vision_to_vaughan.html |title=Toronto’s subway brings downtown vision to Vaughan |newspaper=[[Toronto Star]] |author=Noor Javed |date={{date|2012-04-06}} |accessdate=2016-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2012, proposed developments at VMC include the five-building, 37-storey Expo City condos, and Liberty Developments' proposed office building plus four condo buildings on the south corner of Jane Street and Highway 7.&lt;ref name=TheStar-2012-04-06/&gt;

Pino DiMascio, an urban planner who helped create the official plan for Vaughan, said that the new city centre would need cultural spaces, retail, civic spaces and green space to be successful in attracting people to take the subway north to Vaughan as relying on just condos and office buildings that is claimed to have failed to make North York Centre a success.&lt;ref name=TheStar-2012-04-06/&gt;

Two traffic circles will be constructed on Highway 7 at Commerce Street and Maplecrete Road; these will intersect a ring road that will represent the border of this core. Parts of this ring road already exist as Commerce Street, and portions of Doughton Road, Maplecrete Road, and Applemill Road. The new Vaughan Metropolitan Centre TTC subway station is located at the intersection of Highway 7 and Millway Avenue at the centre of the core. Inside the core, the average block will be 100m by 100m (330&amp;nbsp;ft. by 330&amp;nbsp;ft.). Thus the theoretical maximum number of blocks is 40, but the Black Creek Valley and the non-perpendicular Jane Street will lower that number somewhat.

These blocks will be separated by small roads, alleys, or pedestrian walkways. One of the first buildings built with the small block size taken into account was the two-storey Future Shop, which has since closed. At ground level, this building has small shop-sized units facing Highway 7 and Millway Drive that are currently vacant.

In late 2015, a community website was launched in an effort to raise awareness, provide resources, engage members of the community, and highlight the progress of the Vaughan Metro Centre development.

Further details of the City of Vaughan's plans for expansion and development are included as part of the council's secondary plan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.vaughanmetrocentre.ca/secondaryplan/|title=Secondary Plan - Vaughan Metropolitan Centre|date=2015-10-08|work=Vaughan Metropolitan Centre|access-date=2018-02-18|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public transit==

VMC is served by both [[York Region Transit|York Region Transit (YRT)]] and [[Brampton Transit]] buses, and the [[Toronto Transit Commission|Toronto Transit Commission (TTC)]] subway.

[[Vaughan Metropolitan Centre station]] is located at the intersection of Highway 7 and Millway Avenue, just west of Jane Street. It is the northwestern terminus of [[Line 1 Yonge-University]]. The area is also served by YRT (which includes [[Viva (bus rapid transit)|Viva]]) and [[Brampton Transit]]'s [[Züm]] buses on Highway 7 and Jane Street. Viva and [[501 Züm Queen]] buses travel along the [[Highway 7 Rapidway]], which features a covered [[Vaughan Metropolitan Centre station#Vivastation|Vivastation]] in its centre for transferring to the subway. Conventional YRT buses currently connect with the station on-street, but will (with the exception of Route 77) be moved to the under-construction [[Vaughan Metropolitan Centre station#SmartCentres Place Bus Terminal|SmartCentres Place Bus Terminal]] upon its completion.

The subway station is part of the TTC Toronto fare zone and no extra fare is charged to enter and exit. However, there are no free transfers to and from the subway and YRT or Züm buses, and the appropriate system's fare is charged when transferring.

'''William Brownie Garden''' (December 2, 1869 – 1960) was a Scottish inventor and entrepreneur. He is probably best known for his invention of the "revolving blackboard". Up until his death at age 90, in 1960, the ‘Inventor’ still worked at his own bench in the factory, from which came innovations like an improved saw which cut ten times quicker than any other, and an eight-wheeled car for faster cornering.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} For relaxation he produced scores of beautifully carved walking sticks, which he presented free to the older townspeople.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} His mind roamed the entire mechanical firmament. He was a dreamer with the most practical of brains, who, even in his youth, foresaw the future by drawing tentative plans for a vertical take-off aero engine.{{says who?|date=February 2011}}

‘Wullie Gairden’ as he was known locally had six children, two sons and four daughters of which two sons William and John and daughter Mary joined the firm. As well as being a Master Joiner he was a genius for invention.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

== Business ==
William Brownie Garden was a [[Joiner|Master Joiner]] and in 1904 he set up his own joinery business. His company, Wilson &amp; Garden, Ltd., was founded in Kilsyth, Scotland. The main product was the rollerboard.&lt;ref name=space&gt;{{cite web|title=Company History|url=http://www.spacerighteurope.com/about-spaceright-europe-store/#answer1|publisher=Spaceright, Ltd.|accessdate=24 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wilson &amp; Garden became a limited company in 1923 as ‘Builders and Joiners’. At this time they were also the local undertakers. As the demand for the roller boards increased in the early 1950s the focus of the company switched from property building to the manufacture of the roller boards and by the late 1950s the building side ceased altogether.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

The company was taken over by Ultralon Holdings in 2005. In 2008 the company became Spaceright Europe, Ltd.&lt;ref name=space /&gt;

== Inventions ==
=== Infinitely variable gear box ===
In 1955 he decided that cars didn’t need a [[clutch]], a gear lever, or brakes, and took out a provisional patent on what he described as his ‘[[Automatic transmission|Infinitely variable gear Box]]’. Motor engineers, who checked the plans, pronounced the invention foolproof and gave their opinion that it could be mass-produced quite cheaply.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

The method was that, on the movement of a lever, the car would glide away from rest to full speed. Moving the lever back would bring the car to a halt, the engine acting as a brake; the lever moved further back would put the car in reverse.

=== Skid proofing vehicles ===
At one time he set his mind to the problem of combating the hazards of driving on icy roads, and patented a device to make vehicles skid proof. It was fitted to one of the firm’s Lorries and tried out on the severest of days. It was a complete success, the vehicle just refused to lose adhesion, but having proved his point, his interest waned and the project wasn’t pursued. Having successfully solved one problem, he couldn’t wait to get to the next.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

=== Totalisator ===
Around 1929 another of his inventions was the ‘[[Totalisator]]’ for racetracks.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} This ‘Tote’ was an automatic system for registering bets, and working out the odds on winners according to the extent to which they have been backed.

=== Revolving Blackboard ===
Perhaps his most practical invention was the Revolving Surface Writing Board, or rollerboard, in 1911.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BESA member news: Centenary of Scottish invention still ‘ Writing History ’|url=http://www.besa.org.uk/besa/news/view.jsp?item=2460|publisher=British Educational Suppliers Association (BESA)|accessdate=24 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Garden|first=William Brownie|title=ORIGINAL PATENT APPLICATION NUMBER 21,140 FOR AN IMPROVED BLACK-BOARD OR LIKE APPARATUS FOR SCHOLASTIC AND LIKE PURPOSES (KILSYTH)|year=1909|publisher=HSMO}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=US Patent|url=http://www.google.com/patents/about?id=ubV5AAAAEBAJ|publisher=Google|accessdate=23 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally instigated by Mr. McCubbin the rector of Kilsyth Academy, who had drawn ‘Wullie Gairden’s attention to the limitations of the old slate blackboard with its necessity for constant cleaning.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} Small teachers had to stand on boxes to reach the top of the slate board and tall teachers had to stoop to reach the bottom of the board. “Couldn’t you do something about that?” he asked, and the challenge was enough for him.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

Using the roller towel principle, and substituting a specially treated fabric for slate, the first of the now internationally known revolving boards was created. The original prototype is still in use today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=McIlvean|first=John|title=End of the line?|url=http://www.cumbernauld-news.co.uk/news/local-headlines/end_of_the_line_1_355818|accessdate=24 February 2011|newspaper=Cumbernauld News|date=6 April 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The largest board of all is in [[Oxford University]] in the [[Clarendon Laboratory]], a giant over 20 feet high.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}
