== Background ==

The [[University of Pretoria Faculty of Education]], [[South Africa]], took the initiative in 2013 to establish a platform for African deans of education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.up.ac.za/en/programmes/StudyLevel/13/Faculty/F6/mod/postgrad/year/2017|title=Study Programmes - University of Pretoria|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; An informal structure under the leadership of Prof Irma Eloff ([[University of Pretoria]] Dean at the time) was established, with the [[University of Pretoria]] hosting the Secretariat of the Forum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deta.up.ac.za/adef_facilitator_cvs.htm|title=African Deans of Education Forum Facilitator CV's|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
  
The ADEF was launched in July 2013 at the DETA 2013 Conference in [[Nairobi]], [[Kenya]].

Prof Irma Eloff will be stepping down as the lead facilitator of ADEF on 31 December 2018.

Prof Antonio Cipriano Goncalves, the Dean of Education at Eduardo Mondlane University in Mozambique (http://www.uem.mz/) will be the lead facilitator of ADEF from 1 January 2019.

== Purpose ==

The purpose of the Forum is to facilitate dialogue on critical issues in teacher education among the leadership of African faculties of education.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.deta.up.ac.za/adef.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

== Meetings ==

The first meeting was held at the launch of the Forum during the DETA 2013 Conference, co-hosted by the [[University of Pretoria]], [[South Africa]], and the [[University of Nairobi]], [[Kenya]]. The deans of the Faculty of Education of these two institutions, Prof Irma Eloff ([[University of Pretoria]]) and Prof Henry Mutoro ([[University of Nairob]]i) co-facilitated the Forum.  Deans from Anglophone, Francophone, Lusophone and Arabic Africa were present at the founding meeting.  Prof Bob Moon, professor of Education at the [[Open University]] ([[United Kingdom]]) and founding director of the Teacher Education in Sub-Saharan Africa (TESSA) Programme, served as distinguished guest at the founding meeting.  26 signatories accompanied the founding meeting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archivedpublicwebsite.up.ac.za/pdfs/14055_Africa%20Deans%20of%20Education%20Forum%20established%20in%20Nairobi%252C%20Kenya.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-04-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160928010754/http://archivedpublicwebsite.up.ac.za/pdfs/14055_Africa%20Deans%20of%20Education%20Forum%20established%20in%20Nairobi%2C%20Kenya.pdf |archivedate=2016-09-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second meeting of ADEF was hosted by the Faculty of Education, [[University of Pretoria]], [[South Africa]] in July 2014. Prof Irma Eloff hosted and facilitated the meeting.

The third meeting was held during the DETA 2015 Conference, July 2015, hosted by the Mauritius Institute of Education. The meeting was co-facilitated by Dr Oomandra Varma, Director of the Mauritius Institute of Education, and Prof Irma Eloff, Dean of the Faculty of Education, [[University of Pretoria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.teachersforefa.unesco.org/v2/index.php/en/newss/item/486-the-6th-deta-conference|title=Africa Prepares to Implement the Teacher Target|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
At the meetings, participants mapped out critical issues for teacher education and development in [[Africa]], shared their experiences and suggested an agenda for future communication and discussion amongst deans of Education in [[Africa]].

In June 2016 ADEF met at the African Union in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Various deans presented innovative approaches in which teacher education was addressed within their respective contexts {http://www.deta.up.ac.za/}.  The growing role of technology in teacher education featured prominently during the presentations.  An Interim Steering Committee, representing the regional African deans, was constituted.

In August 2017 ADEF met at the University of Rwanda in Kigali.  The role of ADEF as a focal point of the UNESCO Teacher Task Force 

(http://www.teachersforefa.unesco.org/v2/index.php/en/) was discussed.  Ideas for a cohesive project that would leverage the expertise and capacity of ADEF to support Sustainable Development Goal 4 (https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/sdg4) was discussed.  The idea to create a doctoral network with a focus on teacher education in Africa received the full support of the meeting.  The Steering Committee was mandated to explore and develop the idea of a doctoral network in teacher education.

In February 2018 regional representatives from ADEF met at the Cradle of Humankind in South Africa to discuss the potential of a doctoral network in teacher education.  The Doctoral Network in Teacher Education in Africa (DNTEA) was conceptualized and the preliminary framework for DNTEA was designed.  The founding members of the DNTEA was Irma Eloff (South Africa), Antonio Cipriano Goncalves (Mozambique), Amani Ibrahim Abed Elgafar (Sudan), Therese Tchombe (Cameroon), Alois Chiromo (Zimbabwe) and Hyleen Mariaye (Mauritius).

The founding members of DNTEA were invited to present a symposium at the WERA World Congress (World Education Research) in Cape town in August 2018 (http://www.wera2018.co.za/).  Subsequently, the group was also invited to present the development of DNTEA at the 11th Policy Dialogue Forum of the International Task Force on Teachers for Education 2030 in Jamaica, November 2018 (http://www.teachersforefa.unesco.org/v2/index.php/en/).

== UNESCO recognition ==

At the third ADEF meeting, participants decided that the ADEF needed to establish a more formal structure to represent all the regions of Africa.
Since the meeting, Dr Edem Adubra (Head of the Secretariat, International Task Force on Teachers for Education for All (EFA, UNESCO) has informed Prof Eloff that the ADEF has been accepted as a recognised member of the [[UNESCO]] International Teachers Task Force ([[Education for All]]),&lt;ref&gt;http://www.teachersforefa.unesco.org/v2/index.php/en/&lt;/ref&gt; and to serve as the voice of African deans on the platform. An interim steering committee has now been initiated with representatives from all the regions of Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.teachersforefa.unesco.org/v2/index.php/en/|title=Teachers Task Force for EFA|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.teachersforefa.unesco.org/v2/images/Final_2_TTF_Newsletter_June_2015_English.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

At the 8th Policy Dialogue Forum of the Teacher Task Force for Education ADEF presented views on teacher education from Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ttfmx16.wordpress.com/|title=8th Policy Dialogue Forum of the Teacher Task Force for Education 2030|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The goal of this Policy Dialogue Forum, which took place in [[Mexico City]] in March 2016, was to share policies and practices in teacher education from around the globe.  ADEF was represented at the 9th Policy Dialogue Forum in Cambodia by prof Deena Boraie from Egypt and prof Antonio Cipriano Goncalves from Mozambique.  At the 10th Policy Dialogue Forum in Lome, Togo, ADEF was represented by Irma Eloff and the initial idea of a doctoral network for teacher education in Africa was shared during informal networking opportunities.  A formal presentation on DNTEA (Doctoral Network for Teacher Education in Africa) was made at the 11th Policy Dialogue Forum in Montego Bay, Jamaica in November 2018.

[[File:Alec Young Grave.jpg|thumb|right|The grave of Alec David Young in [[Cambridge City Cemetery]]]]
'''Alec David Young''' (15 August 1913&amp;nbsp;– 27 January 2005)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Clarke | first1 = J. F. | last2 = Riley | first2 = N. | doi = 10.1098/rsbm.2007.0004 | title = Alec David Young. 15 August 1913 -- 27 January 2005: Elected FRS 1973 | journal = [[Biographical Memoirs of Fellows of the Royal Society]] | volume = 53 | pages = 401 | year = 2007 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[Great Britain|British]] [[aeronautical engineer]].

Alec Young was the son of refugees from Russia who raised him in [[Shepley]], [[West Yorkshire]]. He attended [[Central Foundation Boys' School]] for his secondary education. He first noticed his future wife Dora Caplan when they were both studying at a public library.

In December 1931 he sat for examination at [[Cambridge University]] and was successful at winning an [[Exhibition (scholarship)|Exhibition]] to [[Gonville and Caius College]]. He was obliged to make an intense study of [[Latin]] for admission.

Beyond his studies at Cambridge, Alec played tennis, swam, was cox of a boat, and courted Dora. After graduation he continued study with [[Melvill Jones]] who had written "The Streamline Aeroplane" for the [[Royal Aeronautical Society]] in 1929. Their study aimed to reduce [[parasitic drag]] of an aircraft. Alec published his findings with the [[Aeronautical Research Council]].

In 1936 he went to the Aerodynamics Department of the [[Royal Aircraft Establishment]] at [[Farnborough, Hampshire]]. There he became a member of the [[Civil Service (United Kingdom)|Civil Service]] and was able to marry his sweetheart Dora. They were to have two sons, Robert and Johnathan. Minimization of drag was his focus, even measuring drag of rivet heads, lap joints, gaps and paint. He was able to give corrective instructions for the [[Hampden bomber]] and some [[trainer (aircraft)|trainer]]s.

In 1942 he began to work with a [[wind tunnel]] and [[William Hawthorne]] in development of [[jet engine]]s. The work sought to determine high-speed flow characteristics in inlets, curved and straight ducts, and diffusers. He also worked with [[Sydney Goldstein]] of the National Physical Laboratory to extend the [[Prandtl-Glauert transformation]] from two to three dimensions.

In July 1946 Alec became Senior Lecturer at the [[College of Aeronautics, Cranfield]]. One of Alec's collaborations there was with [[Abraham Robinson]] on 3D flows approaching the [[speed of sound]]. Another project attempted [[noise control]] of jet engines by modification of the efflux nozzle to improve mixing with external flow. He was awarded a [[patent]] and collected some royalties.

Daughter Judith arrived in 1949, and the following year Alec became [[Professor]] at Cranfield. In 1951 he was elected Fellow of the [[Royal Aeronautical Society]]. In 1954 he became Chair of Aeronautical Engineering, [[Queen Mary University of London]]. In 1962 he was elected Dean of the Faculty of  Engineering. A bachelor's degree in [[avionics]] was pioneered in collaboration with [[Marconi Electronic Systems]]. In 1966 he became Vice-Principle at the College.

Dora Young developed a brain tumor in 1968 and died in 1970. The following year daughter Judith married [[Herman Waldmann]]. His mother, a widow, then married Alec the widower. He formally retired in 1978 but continued with some collaborations.

He was awarded an [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]] in 1964, and elected a Fellow of the [[Royal Society]] in 1973. He was awarded the [[Ludwig-Prandtl-Ring]] from the [[Deutsche Gesellschaft für Luft- und Raumfahrt]] (German Society for Aeronautics and Astronautics) for "outstanding contribution in the field of aerospace engineering" in 1976.

He is buried in the Jewish Section of [[Cambridge City Cemetery]].

'''American Siren''' is a [[beauty contest]] started November 2010.  It is an [[Urban area|urban]] pageant offering a yearly cash prize, entertainment contracts, and scholarship assistance to the winners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prlog.org/11209370-invision-filmworks-launches-american-siren-beauty-pageant.pdf|title=American Siren info|accessdate=2011-01-25|publisher=prlog.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pageant's focus is to spotlight the modern urban woman and to promote [[women in business]].

==History==
American Siren was launched by Invision Filmworks in January 2011&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ecplaza.net/news/09/67355/american_siren_pageant.html |title=Invision Filmworks Launches American Siren |accessdate=2011-01-25 |publisher=ecplaza.net |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723105312/http://www.ecplaza.net/news/09/67355/american_siren_pageant.html |archivedate=2011-07-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; as a recruiting tool for new faces in the [[entertainment industry]], keeping inline with the principles of presenting more positive images of [[minorities]] and urban life.  The pageant was created as a solution to the exploitation and [[controversy]] of hip hop models and so called [[video vixen]]s;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/video/#/video/living/2008/07/24/bia.obrien.video.vixens.cnn?iref=allsearch|title=Black in America: Video Vixens Too Revealing?|accessdate=2011-01-25|publisher=cnn.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; providing positive representations of the [[morals]] and [[values]] of minority and urban women instead of the more common negative, degrading, subservient, or [[misogynistic]] images popularly portrayed.  The pageant's intention is to showcase the "urban woman" in a new light by combining the world of entertainment with the world of business thus giving young women not just positive new role models but educating them of the many career options available despite the preconceived [[prejudices]] toward [[beauty]].

==Competition==
The competition is open to all women over the age of 18.  Entry requires contestants to submit an essay and to sign an honor pledge see [[honor code]].  Not a traditional pageant accepting contestants representing their respective [[U.S. state|State]], the contestants instead represent a business or similar sponsor as Ms._____________(Sponsor/Business Name).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kosmix.com/topic/the_american_pageant/Opinions-and-Discussions |title=discussion forum |accessdate=2011-01-25 |publisher=Americanconsumernews.com }}{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;  American Siren licences the ability of Sponsors to conduct their own preliminaries for entry into the pageant.

==Judging==
The judging is conducted during the following events where contestants display their individuality, poise, and grace:

'''1) T-shirt and Stilettos:'''  In the T-shirt and Stilettos portion of the pageant the contestants wear a T-shirt promoting their sponsor, their favorite cause, or charity.

'''''Breakaway'''''  is a soccer [[browser game]] developed by the Emergent Media Center at [[Champlain College]] and released during the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]] as part of the [[United Nations Development Programme]]. The game is [[educational game|intended to educate]] children about gender issues: when the player makes gender equality-positive choices, the game enables the player's character to play better soccer.

Over 150 student developers have worked on the game since the Emergent Media Center began development in 2008. The students chose soccer because of the United Nations [[requirement]]s. The developers found that the game had a positive impact on players's gender attitude; the game has also enabled mixed-gender soccer camps in multiple regions of the world.

== Gameplay ==
The player can access the game after creating an account.&lt;ref name="tech times"/&gt; The [[player character]] plays on a [[association football|soccer]] team with the goal of reaching the finals.&lt;ref name="polygon 2015"/&gt; In each level, the player makes a number of choices related to [[gender equality]], including a girl's abuse and abduction.&lt;ref name="polygon 2015"/&gt; The player who makes choices sympathetic to gender equality wins,&lt;ref name="vg"/&gt; while the player who interacts with negative [[non-player character]]s is designed to lose the game.&lt;ref name="cnet 2010"/&gt; Interspersed with the plot-focused levels are mini-games, where the player's character learns better skills from the more-positive characters, such as [[Samuel Eto'o]].&lt;ref name="cnet 2010"/&gt;

== Development and release ==
The Emergent Media Center at [[Champlain College]] developed the game in response to a United Nations campaign to teach children "a healthy, equal attitude towards girls and women."&lt;ref name="cnet 2010"/&gt;&lt;ref name="tc 2016"/&gt; The game is co-developed with the Population Media Center,&lt;ref name="cnet 2010"/&gt; and has been funded by the [[United Nations Population Fund]] and the United Nations Development Programme.&lt;ref name="polygon 2015"/&gt;&lt;ref name="tc 2016"/&gt; It took the team of approximately 100 students two years to develop the game (5 "episodes"),&lt;ref name="cnet 2010"/&gt; with a further eight "episodes" fully completed by 2013.&lt;ref name="polygon 2015"/&gt; Over 150 students had helped with the game by 2016.&lt;ref name="tc 2016"/&gt;

The developers traveled to [[South Africa]] to understand the "social conditions that can lead to abuse", such as physical abuse, date rape, sex slavery, and honor killing.&lt;ref name="cnet 2010"/&gt; The development of the game was challenging as a result of United Nations requirements, "including that the game show no real violence and appeal to a global population."&lt;ref name="gr 2015"/&gt; Soccer was chosen because of its universality.&lt;ref name="polygon 2015"/&gt; The game was targeted at boys ages 9 to 14.&lt;ref name="gamasutra"/&gt; The negative team captain was strongly-modeled after a person with [[borderline personality disorder]]; play-testers did not empathize with the initial design and so he was scaled back.&lt;ref name="gr 2015"/&gt; The developers employed [[Sabido methodology]], attempting to provide 70% entertainment and 30% educational message, which the director Ann DeMarle believes may have influenced the game's success.&lt;ref name="gr 2015"/&gt; The game has been translated to four languages,&lt;ref name="tech times"/&gt; and the development team provides a supplementary educator's guide for post-game activities.&lt;ref name="theatre"/&gt;

The game was released during the 2010 FIFA World Cup and was later demonstrated to a number of UN officials.&lt;ref name="cnet 2010"/&gt;

In 2016, the developers were seeking an award which would enable the team to develop a mobile version, localize the game to South Africa, run camps, and provide computer equipment.&lt;ref name="tc 2016"/&gt; They were also attempting to raise money for a Mandarin translation.&lt;ref name="tech times"/&gt;

== Reception ==
''CNET'' thought the graphics were "colorful" and the music "lively".&lt;ref name="cnet 2010"/&gt;

The developers found that 90% of players make positive decisions.&lt;ref name="cnet 2010"/&gt; Young boys initially thought the concept of girls playing soccer controversial; after playing the game, nearly 90% "agreed that girls can play soccer".&lt;ref name="polygon 2015"/&gt; Research by [[State University of New York at Buffalo]] "demonstrated that the game had a profound impact on participants' awareness and attitudes, and also indicated behavioral change."&lt;ref name="tc 2016"/&gt;

The game has been played in 185 countries, and led to mixed-gender youth soccer camps in [[El Salvador]] and the [[Palestinian territories]] ([[Hebron]]&lt;ref name="tech times"/&gt;), the latter "[challenging] social norms."&lt;ref name="tc 2016"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="825">The '''Dar al-Tabligh''' was a Shiite seminary in [[Qom]]. It was established in the mid-1960s by eminent grand ayatollah [[Mohammad Kazem Shariatmadari]] and soon emerged as one of the most popular [[hawza]] for Iranian and foreign students, with a prolific publishing outlet.&lt;ref name="fischer"&gt;Michael M. J. Fischer, ''Iran: From Religious Dispute to Revolution'', Wisconsin: University of Wisconsin Press, 2003, p.84ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1973, Dar al-Tabligh opened a women's section, called [[Dar al-Zahra]], which by 1975 counted 150 female students, taught by male teachers from behind a curtain.&lt;ref name="fischer" /&gt;

With the fall-out between [[Mohammad Kazem Shariatmadari]] and Khomeini, the seminary was closed and Shariatmadari was placed under house arrest.

'''Donald Ervin Knuth''' ({{IPAc-en|k|ə|ˈ|n|uː|θ}}&lt;ref name="faq"/&gt; {{respell|kə|NOOTH|'}}; born January 10, 1938) is an American [[computer science|computer scientist]], [[mathematician]], and [[professor emeritus]] at [[Stanford University]].

He is the author of the multi-volume work ''[[The Art of Computer Programming]]''. He contributed to the development of the rigorous analysis of the computational complexity of algorithms and systematized formal mathematical techniques for it. In the process he also popularized the [[Big O notation|asymptotic notation]]. In addition to fundamental contributions in several branches of [[theoretical computer science]], Knuth is the creator of the [[TeX]] computer typesetting system, the related [[METAFONT]] font definition language and rendering system, and the [[Computer Modern]] family of typefaces.

As a writer and scholar, Knuth created the [[WEB]] and [[CWEB]] computer programming systems designed to encourage and facilitate [[literate programming]], and designed the [[MIX]]/[[MMIX]] [[instruction set|instruction set architectures]]. Knuth strongly opposes granting [[software patent]]s, having expressed his opinion to the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office]] and [[European Patent Organisation]].

==Biography==
===Early life===
Knuth was born in [[Milwaukee]], [[Wisconsin]], to German-Americans Ervin Henry Knuth and Louise Marie Bohning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nndb.com/people/571/000023502/ |title=Donald E. Knuth |publisher= |accessdate=October 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father had two jobs: running a small printing company and teaching bookkeeping at [[Milwaukee Lutheran High School]].&lt;ref name="Raskin2013"&gt;{{cite book |author=Molly Knight Raskin |title=No Better Time: The Brief, Remarkable Life of Danny Lewin--the Genius who Transformed the Internet |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Pi79AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA61 |year=2013 |publisher=Da Capo Press, Incorporated |isbn=978-0-306-82166-0 |pages=61–62}}&lt;/ref&gt; Donald, a student at Milwaukee Lutheran High School, received academic accolades there, especially because of the ingenious ways that he thought of solving problems.&lt;ref name="Raskin2013"/&gt; For example, in eighth grade, he entered a contest to find the number of words that the letters in "Ziegler's Giant Bar" could be rearranged to create. Although the judges only had 2,500 words on their list, Donald found 4,500 words, winning the contest. As prizes, the school received a new television and enough candy bars for all of his schoolmates to eat.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |year=1998 |title=Out of their minds: the lives and discoveries of 15 great computer scientists |first1=Dennis Elliott |last1=Shasha |first2=Cathy A |last2=Lazere |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-0-387-98269-4 |page=90 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=-0tDZX3z-8UC&amp;pg=PA90}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Raskin2013"/&gt;

===Education===

In 1956, Knuth received a scholarship to the [[Case Western Reserve University|Case Institute of Technology]] (now part of [[Case Western Reserve University]]) in Cleveland, Ohio. He also joined Beta Nu Chapter of the [[Theta Chi fraternity]]. While studying physics at the Case Institute of Technology, Knuth was introduced to the [[IBM 650]], one of the early [[mainframe computer|mainframes]]. After reading the computer's manual, Knuth decided to rewrite the assembly and compiler code for the machine used in his school, because he believed he could do it better.&lt;ref name="Koshy2004"&gt;{{Cite book |first=Thomas |last=Koshy |title=Discrete mathematics with applications |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=90KApidK5NwC&amp;pg=PA244 |accessdate=July 30, 2011 |year=2004 |publisher=Academic Press |isbn=978-0-12-421180-3 |page=244}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1958, Knuth created a program to help his school's basketball team win their games. He assigned "values" to players in order to gauge their probability of getting points, a novel approach that ''[[Newsweek]]'' and ''[[CBS Evening News]]'' later reported on.&lt;ref name= "Koshy2004"/&gt;

Knuth was one of the founding editors of the ''Engineering and Science Review'', which won a national award as best technical magazine in 1959.&lt;ref name = "Beta Nu Chapter"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://greeklife.case.edu/org/thetachi/Our_History |title=Theta Chi |author=History of Beta Nu Chapter |publisher=CWRU}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then switched from physics to mathematics, and in 1960 he received his bachelor of science degree, simultaneously being given a master of science degree by a special award of the faculty who considered his work exceptionally outstanding.&lt;ref name = "Koshy2004" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "Turing Award"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://amturing.acm.org/award_winners/knuth_1013846.cfm |title=A.M. Turing Award; Donald ("Don") Erwin Knuth |publisher=[[Association for Computing Machinery|ACM]] |year=1974}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1963, with mathematician [[Marshall Hall (mathematician)|Marshall Hall]] as his adviser,&lt;ref name=mathgene/&gt; he earned a PhD in mathematics from the [[California Institute of Technology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |publisher=Caltech |year=1963 |url=http://thesis.library.caltech.edu/2441/1/Knuth_de_1963.pdf |title=Finite Semifields and Projective Planes |first=Donald Ervin |last=Knuth |postscript=PhD dissertation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early work===
After receiving his PhD, Knuth joined Caltech's faculty as an associate professor.

He accepted a commission to write a book on computer [[programming language]] [[compiler]]s. While working on this project, Knuth decided that he could not adequately treat the topic without first developing a fundamental theory of computer programming, which became ''[[The Art of Computer Programming]]''. He originally planned to publish this as a single book. As Knuth developed his outline for the book, he concluded that he required six volumes, and then seven, to thoroughly cover the subject. He published the first volume in 1968.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://cs.stanford.edu/~knuth/taocp.html |title=The Art of Computer Programming |publisher=Stanford University}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Just before publishing the first volume of ''The Art of Computer Programming'', Knuth left Caltech to accept employment with the [[Institute for Defense Analyses#Center for Communications and Computing|Institute for Defense Analyses' Communications Research Division]], then situated on the [[Princeton University]] campus, which was performing mathematical research in [[cryptography]] to support the [[National Security Agency]].

Knuth then left this position to join the [[Stanford University]] faculty, where he is now Fletcher Jones Professor of Computer Science, Emeritus.&lt;ref name="homepage"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://cs.stanford.edu/~knuth/ |title=Home page |last=Knuth |first=Donald Ervin |publisher=[[Stanford University]] |accessdate=2005-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://profiles.stanford.edu/donald-knuth&lt;/ref&gt;

== Writings ==
Knuth is a writer, as well as a computer scientist.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://cs.stanford.edu/~knuth/vita.html |last=Knuth |first=Donald Ervin |title=Curriculum vitae |publisher=Stanford University}}&lt;/ref&gt; Knuth has been called the "father of the [[analysis of algorithms]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Karp |first=Richard M. |authorlink=Richard M. Karp |date=February 1986 |doi=10.1145/5657.5658 |issue=2 |journal=Communications of the ACM |location=New York, NY, USA |pages=98–109 |publisher=ACM |title=Combinatorics, Complexity, and Randomness |volume=29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''The Art of Computer Programming'' (''TAOCP'') ===
{{main |The Art of Computer Programming}}

In the 1970s, Knuth described computer science as "a totally new field with no real identity. And the standard of available publications was not that high. A lot of the papers coming out were quite simply wrong.&amp;nbsp;... So one of my motivations was to put straight a story that had been very badly told."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fbbva.es/TLFU/tlfu/ing/microsites/premios/fronteras/galardonados/2010/informacion.jsp |title=BBVA Foundation Frontiers of Knowledge Awards |publisher= |accessdate=October 15, 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160819042332/http://www.fbbva.es/TLFU/tlfu/ing/microsites/premios/fronteras/galardonados/2010/informacion.jsp |archivedate=August 19, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2011, the first three volumes and part one of volume four of his series had been published.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Knuth |first=Donald Ervin |title=The Art of Computer Programming (TAOCP) |url=http://cs.stanford.edu/~knuth/taocp.html |accessdate=February 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Concrete Mathematics|Concrete Mathematics: A Foundation for Computer Science]]'' 2nd ed., which originated with an expansion of the mathematical preliminaries section of Volume 1 of ''TAoCP'', has also been published.

[[Bill Gates]] has praised the difficulty of the subject matter in ''The Art of Computer Programming'', stating, "If you think you're a really good programmer&amp;nbsp;... You should definitely send me a résumé if you can read the whole thing."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.businessinsider.com/bill-gates-loves-donald-knuth-the-art-of-computer-programming-2016-4 |title=Bill Gates once said 'definitely send me a résumé' if you finish this fiendishly difficult book' |last=Weinberger |first=Matt |date=26 April 2016 |website=BusinessInsider.com  | access-date=13 June 2016 |quote="If you think you're a really good programmer&amp;hellip; read (Knuth's) Art of Computer Programming&amp;hellip; You should definitely send me a résumé if you can read the whole thing," read a quote from Bill Gates on the cover of the third edition of the first volume.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other works ===
Knuth is also the author of ''[[Surreal Numbers (book)|Surreal Numbers]]'',&lt;ref name=surreal/&gt; a mathematical novelette on [[John Horton Conway|John Conway]]'s [[set theory]] construction of an alternate system of numbers. Instead of simply explaining the subject, the book seeks to show the development of the mathematics. Knuth wanted the book to prepare students for doing original, creative research.

In 1995, Knuth wrote the foreword to the book ''A=B'' by [[Marko Petkovšek]], [[Herbert Wilf]] and [[Doron Zeilberger]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.math.rutgers.edu/~zeilberg/DEK.html |title=DEK |last=Zeilberg |publisher=Rutgers}}&lt;/ref&gt; Knuth is also an occasional contributor of language puzzles to ''[[Word Ways: The Journal of Recreational Linguistics]]''.

Knuth has also delved into [[recreational mathematics]].  He contributed articles to the ''[[Journal of Recreational Mathematics]]'' beginning in the 1960s, and was acknowledged as a major contributor in [[Joseph Madachy]]'s ''Mathematics on Vacation''.&lt;ref&gt;Madachy, Joseph S.,''Mathematics on Vacation'', Thomas Nelson &amp; Sons Ltd. 1966&lt;/ref&gt;

Knuth has also appeared in a number of [[Numberphile]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.numberphile.com/team/index.html&lt;/ref&gt; and Computerphile videos on [[YouTube]] where he has discussed topics from writing Surreal Numbers to why he doesn't use email.

===Works regarding Knuth's religious beliefs===
In addition to his writings on computer science, Knuth, a [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]],{{Sfn | Platoni | 2006}} is also the author of ''3:16 Bible Texts Illuminated'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Knuth |first=Donald Ervin |title=3:16 : Bible texts illuminated |year=1991 |place=Madison, [[Wisconsin|WI]] |publisher=A-R Eds |isbn=978-0-89579-252-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which he examines the Bible by a process of [[systematic sampling]], namely an analysis of chapter 3, verse 16 of each book.  Each verse is accompanied by a rendering in calligraphic art, contributed by a group of calligraphers under the leadership of [[Hermann Zapf]]. Subsequently, he was invited to give a set of lectures on his 3:16 project, resulting in another book, ''[[Things a Computer Scientist Rarely Talks About]]'', where he published the lectures ''"God and Computer Science"''.

===Opinion on software patents===
As a member of the academic and scientific community, Knuth is strongly opposed to the policy of granting [[software patent]]s for trivial solutions that should be obvious, but has expressed more nuanced views for nontrivial solutions such as the [[interior-point method]] of [[linear programming]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://www.ams.org/notices/200203/fea-knuth.pdf |title=All Questions Answered |date=March 2002 |type=article |journal=Notices |publisher=The American Mathematical Society}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has expressed his disagreement directly to both the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office]] and [[European Patent Organisation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.groklaw.net/images/G308Knuth.pdf |last=Knuth |first=Donald Ervin |postscript=Letter |title=Against software patents}} to the patent offices in the USA and Europe.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Computer Musings ==
Knuth gives informal lectures a few times a year at [[Stanford University]], which he titled "Computer Musings". He is a visiting professor at the [[Oxford University Department of Computer Science]] in the United Kingdom and an Honorary Fellow of [[Magdalen College, Oxford|Magdalen College]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Professor Donald Knuth |publisher=Magdalen College |url=http://www.magd.ox.ac.uk/whos-here/fellows-and-lecturers/fellows/knuthd |accessdate=December 6, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110104142353/http://www.magd.ox.ac.uk/whos-here/fellows-and-lecturers/fellows/knuthd |archivedate=January 4, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Notices |url=https://www.ox.ac.uk/gazette/2014-2015/30october2014-no5075/notices/ |work=[[Oxford University Gazette]] |date=October 30, 2014 |accessdate=May 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Programming==

===Digital Typesetting===
In the 1970s the publishers of [[TAOCP]] abandoned [[Monotype_System| Monotype]] in favor of [[phototypesetting]]. Knuth became so frustrated with the inability of the latter system to approach the quality of the previous volumes, typeset using the older system, that he took time out to work on digital typesetting and created [[TeX]] and [[Metafont]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.kyotoprize.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/12kA_lct_EN.pdf |title=Digital Typography (Kyoto Prize Lecture, 1996) |last=Knuth| first=Donald Erwin| orig-year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Literate Programming===
While developing TeX, Knuth created a new methodology of programming, which he called [[Literate Programming]], because he believed that programmers should think of programs as works of literature. "Instead of imagining that our main task is to instruct a computer what to do, let us concentrate rather on explaining to human beings what we want a computer to do."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.literateprogramming.com/knuthweb.pdf |title=Literate Programming |last=Knuth| first=Donald Erwin| orig-year=1984}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Knuth embodied the idea of literate programming in the [[WEB]] system. The same WEB source is used to ''weave'' a TeX file, and to ''tangle'' a [[Pascal_programming_language|Pascal]] source file. These in their turn produce a readable description of the program and an executable binary respectively. A later iteration of the system, [[CWEB]], replaces Pascal with [[C_(programming_language)|C]].

Knuth used WEB to program TeX and METAFONT, and published both programs as books.

==Personal life==
Donald Knuth married Nancy Jill Carter on 24 June 1961, while he was a graduate student at the California Institute of Technology. They have two children: John Martin Knuth and Jennifer Sierra Knuth.&lt;ref name="OConnerEtRobertson"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Knuth.html |title=Donald Ervin Knuth |publisher=[[University of St Andrews]] |first1=J. J. |last1=O'Connor |first2=E. F. |last2=Robertson |date=2015 |accessdate=October 20, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chinese name===
Knuth's [[Chinese name]] is Gao Dena ({{zh|s=高德纳|t=高德納|p=Gāo dé nà}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |issn=0896-3207 |journal=[[TUGboat]] |author-last=Reutenauer |author-first=Arthur |pages=68–72 |title=A brief history of TeX, volume II}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="faq"/&gt; In 1977, he was given this name by [[Frances Yao]], shortly before making a 3-week trip to [[China]].&lt;ref name="faq"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cs.stanford.edu/~knuth/faq.html |title=Frequently Asked Questions |last=Knuth |first=Donald Ervin |work=Home page |publisher=[[Stanford University]] |accessdate=2010-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The Art of Computer Programming"/&gt; In his 1980 volume of ''The Art of Computer Programming'' ({{zh|s=计算机程序设计艺术|t=電腦程式設計藝術|p=Jìsuànjī chéngxù shèjì yìshù}}), Knuth explains that he embraced his Chinese name because he wanted to be known by the growing numbers of computer programmers in China at the time. In 1989, his Chinese name was placed atop the ''Journal of Computer Science and Technology''{{'s}} header, which Knuth says "makes me feel close to all Chinese people although I cannot speak your language".&lt;ref name="The Art of Computer Programming"&gt;{{cite book |author-last=Knuth |author-first=Donald Ervin |trans-title=The Art of Computer Programming |translator1-last=Guan |translator1-first=JiWen |translator2-last=Su |translator2-first=Yunlin |title=计算机程序设计技巧 (Ji suan ji cheng xu she ji ji qiao) |publisher=Defense Industry Publishing Co. |date=1980 |location=Beijing |quote=I fondly hope that many Chinese computer programmers will learn to recognize my Chinese name Gao Dena, which was given to me by Francis Yao just before I visited your country in 1977. I still have very fond memories of that three-week visit, and I have been glad to see Gao Dena on the masthead of the ''Journal of Computer Science and Technology'' since 1989. This name makes me feel close to all Chinese people although I cannot speak your language.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Health concerns===
In 2006, Knuth was diagnosed with [[prostate cancer]]. He underwent surgery in December that year and started "a little bit of radiation therapy&amp;nbsp;... as a precaution but the prognosis looks pretty good", as he reported in his video autobiography.&lt;ref name = cancer&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.webofstories.com/people/donald.knuth/85 |title=Donald Knuth: 85 – Coping with cancer |work=[[Web of Stories]] |date=April 2006 |accessdate=May 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Humor===
[[File:knuth-check2.png|thumb|right|One of [[Knuth reward check|Knuth's reward checks]]]]
[[File:Jacob Appelbaum and Donald Knuth.jpg|thumb|right|"Nested [[parentheses|parens]]"—Donald Knuth (on [[Jacob Appelbaum]]'s shirt within the two parentheses), Jacob Appelbaum, and Donald Knuth]]
Knuth used to pay a [[finder's fee]] of $2.56 for any typographical errors or mistakes discovered in his books, because "256 pennies is one [[hexadecimal]] dollar", and $0.32 for "valuable suggestions". According to an article in the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]]'s ''Technology Review'', these [[Knuth reward check]]s are "among computerdom's most prized trophies". Knuth had to stop sending real checks in 2008 due to bank fraud, and instead now gives each error finder a "certificate of deposit" from a publicly listed balance in his fictitious "Bank of [[San Serriffe]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://www.technologyreview.com/featuredstory/400456 |title=Rewriting the Bible in 0s and 1s |journal=[[Technology Review]] |publisher=[[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He once warned a correspondent, "Beware of bugs in the above code; I have only proved it correct, not tried it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cs.stanford.edu/~knuth/faq.html |title=Frequently Asked Questions |last=Knuth |first=Donald Ervin |work=Home page |publisher=[[Stanford University]] |accessdate=November 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Knuth published his first "scientific" article in a school magazine in 1957 under the title "The [[Potrzebie]] System of Weights and Measures". In it, he defined the [[fundamental unit]] of [[length]] as the thickness of ''[[Mad (magazine)|Mad]]'' No. 26, and named the fundamental unit of [[force]] "whatmeworry". ''Mad'' published the article in issue No. 33 (June 1957).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Knuth |first=Donald Ervin |title=The Potrzebie System of Weights &amp; Measures |url=http://madcoversite.com/mad033.html |journal=Mad Magazine |date=June 1957 |issue=33}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kidder"&gt;{{cite book |title=A Truck Full of Money |last=Kidder |first=Tracy |authorlink=Tracy Kidder |publisher=[[Random House]] |page=68 |date=2016 |isbn=9780812995244}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To demonstrate the concept of [[recursion]], Knuth intentionally referred "Circular definition" and "Definition, circular" to each other in the index of ''[[The Art of Computer Programming]], Volume 1''.

The preface of ''[[Concrete Mathematics]]'' has the following paragraph:&lt;blockquote&gt;When DEK taught Concrete Mathematics at Stanford for the first time, he explained the somewhat strange title by saying that it was his attempt to teach a math course that was hard instead of soft.  He announced that, contrary to the expectations of his colleagues, he was ''not'' going to teach the Theory of Aggregates, nor [[Stone's representation theorem for Boolean algebras|Stone's Embedding Theorem]], nor even the [[Stone–Čech compactification]]. (Several students from the civil engineering department got up and quietly left the room.)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

At the TUG 2010 Conference, Knuth announced a satirical [[XML]]-based successor to TeX, titled "iTeX" ({{IPA-all|iː˨˩˦tɛks˧˥|pron}}, performed with a bell ringing), which would support features such as arbitrarily scaled irrational units, [[3D printing]], input from seismographs and heart monitors, animation, and stereophonic sound.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://river-valley.zeeba.tv/media/conferences/tug-2010/Don-Knuth/ |title=TUG |year=2010 |author=Don Knuth |publisher=Zeeba TV |postscript=conference}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |postscript=video recording |last=Knuth |first=Donald Ervin |url=http://river-valley.zeeba.tv/an-earthshaking-announcement/ |publisher=Zeeba TV |title=An Earth‐shaking announcement}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Knuth |first=Donald Ervin |year=2010 |journal=[[TUGboat]] |volume=31 |title=An Earthshaking Announcement |pages=121–24 |issue=2 |issn=0896-3207 |url=http://tug.org/TUGboat/tb31-2/tb98knut.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards and honors==
In 1971, Knuth was the recipient of the first [[Association for Computing Machinery|ACM]] [[Grace Murray Hopper Award]]. He has received various other awards including the [[Turing Award]], the [[National Medal of Science]], the [[John von Neumann Medal]], and the [[Kyoto Prize]].

Knuth was elected a Distinguished Fellow of the British Computer Society (DFBCS) in 1980 in recognition of Knuth's contributions to the field of computer science.

In 1990 he was awarded the one-of-a-kind academic title of ''Professor of The Art of Computer Programming'', which has since been revised to ''Professor [[Emeritus]] of The Art of Computer Programming''.

Knuth was elected to the [[National Academy of Sciences]] in 1975. In 1992, he became an associate of the [[French Academy of Sciences]]. Also that year, he retired from regular research and teaching at [[Stanford University]] in order to finish ''[[The Art of Computer Programming]]''. He was elected a [[List of Fellows of the Royal Society elected in 2003|Foreign Member of the Royal Society (ForMemRS) in 2003]].&lt;ref name=formemrs/&gt;

Knuth was elected as a Fellow (first class of Fellows) of the [[Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics]] in 2009 for his outstanding contributions to mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://fellows.siam.org/index.php?sort=year&amp;value=2009 |title=Fellows |year=2009 |publisher=Siam}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is a member of the [[Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dnva.no/c26849/artikkel/vis.html?tid=40116 |title=Gruppe 1: Matematiske fag |publisher=[[Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters]] |language=Norwegian |accessdate=October 7, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131110152102/http://www.dnva.no/c26849/artikkel/vis.html?tid=40116 |archivedate=November 10, 2013 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, he became a fellow of the [[American Mathematical Society]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ams.org/profession/fellows-list List of Fellows of the American Mathematical Society], retrieved 2013-01-27.&lt;/ref&gt; Other awards and honors include:

The '''Dubai Initiative''' (DI) was a joint venture between the [[Dubai School of Government]] (DSG) and the [[John F. Kennedy School of Government]] at [[Harvard University]]. Established in 2004, it was based at the Kennedy School's [[Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs]]. The Dubai Initiative was closed on 31 December 2011.

DI ran an annual fellowship program for [[doctoral]] candidates, [[post-doc]]s, and practitioners in policy-relevant fields related to the Middle East. It had an internship program for students and sponsors research by faculty, students, and scholars on the Middle East. DI held an annual conference and public events aimed at generating ideas and debate on relevant policy issues.

'''Education in Brazil''' has had many changes. Education in Brazil first began with Jesuit missions.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; They controlled education for a long time, then, two hundred years after their arrival, their powers were limited by Marquis de Pombal.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Shortly after the Jesuits' power was limited, the Brazilian government took over education and it is now is run by the Brazilian government through the [[Ministry of Education (Brazil)|Ministry of Education]].&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

Issues in education are now seen through PISA, the [[Programme for International Student Assessment]], and the Idep assessment now used by the Ministry. They have historically tested below average on all topics but are improving in mathematics.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Brazil uses both public and private school systems. They have the traditional primary, secondary, tertiary and technical school levels.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

{{See also|Society of Jesus|Education in Portugal|Colonization of the Americas}}
When [[Kingdom of Portugal]]'s explorers arrived in Brazil in the 15th century and started to colonize their new possessions in the [[New World]], the territory was inhabited by [[Indigenous peoples of Brazil|indigenous peoples and tribes]] who had no writing system or school education.

The [[Society of Jesus]] (Jesuits) was, since its beginnings in 1540, a [[missionary order]]. [[Evangelisation]] was one of the main goals of the Jesuits and they were committed to teaching and education, in Europe and overseas. The missionary activities, in the cities and in the countryside, were complemented by a strong commitment to [[Education in Portugal|education]]. This took the form of the opening of schools for boys, first in Europe but rapidly extended to America and Asia. The foundation of [[Mission (Christian)|Catholic mission]]s, schools, and [[seminary|seminaries]] was another consequence of the Jesuit involvement in education. As the spaces and cultures where the Jesuits were present varied considerably, their evangelising methods were very often quite different from one place to another. However, the society's engagement in trade, architecture, science, literature, languages, arts, music and religious debate corresponded to the same main purpose of Christianisation. By the middle of the 16th century the Jesuits were present in West Africa, South America, Ethiopia, India, China, and Japan. This enlargement of their missionary activities took shape to a large extent within the framework of the [[Portuguese Empire]].

In a period when the world had a largely illiterate population, the Portuguese Empire was home to one of the first universities founded in Europe — the [[University of Coimbra]], which is one of the oldest universities in continuous operation. Throughout the centuries of Portuguese rule, Brazilian students, mostly graduated of the Jesuit missions and seminaries, were allowed and even encouraged to enroll at [[higher education in Portugal|higher education]] in [[mainland Portugal]].
[[Image:Faculdade direitoSP1.jpg|thumb|left|College of Law.]]
The Jesuits, a religious order founded to promote the cause and teachings of [[Catholicism]], had gained influence with the [[Portuguese crown]] and over education, and had begun missionary work in Portugal's overseas possessions, including the colony of Brazil. By 1700, and reflecting a larger transformation of the [[Portuguese Empire]], the Jesuits had decisively shifted from the [[East Indies]] to Brazil. In the late 18th century, Portuguese minister of the kingdom [[Marquis of Pombal]] attacked the power of the privileged nobility and the church, and expelled the Jesuits from Portugal and its overseas possessions. Pombal seized the Jesuit schools and introduced education reforms all over the empire.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://library.brown.edu/create/fivecenturiesofchange/chapters/chapter-2/the-jesuits/|title=The Jesuit Order in Colonial Brazil {{!}} Brazil: Five Centuries of Change|website=library.brown.edu|access-date=2018-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Brazil, the reforms were noted.

In 1772, before the establishment of the [[Science Academy of Lisbon]] (1779), one of the first learned societies of Brazil and the Portuguese Empire was founded in [[Rio de Janeiro]]: the Sociedade Scientifica. In 1797, the first botanic institute was founded in [[Salvador, Brazil|Salvador]], [[Bahia]]. During the late 18th century, the Escola Politécnica (Polytechnic School) was created, then the Real Academia de Artilharia, Fortificação e Desenho (Royal Academy for Artillery, Fortifications and Design) was created in Rio de Janeiro, 1792, through a decree issued by the Portuguese authorities as a higher education school for the teaching of the sciences and engineering. Its legacy is shared by the [[Instituto Militar de Engenharia]] (Military Engineering Institute) and the Escola Politécnica da Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro (Polytechnic School of the [[Federal University of Rio de Janeiro]]) — the oldest engineering school of Brazil and one of the oldest in the world.

A royal letter of November 20, 1800 by the King [[John VI of Portugal]] established the Aula Prática de Desenho e Figura (Practice Class for Design and Form) in [[Rio de Janeiro]]. It was the first institution in Brazil systematically dedicated to teaching the arts. During [[Colonial Brazil|colonial times]], the arts were mainly religious or utilitarian and were learnt in a system of [[apprenticeship]]. A decree on August 12, 1816 created the Escola Real de Ciências, Artes e Ofícios (Royal School of Sciences, Arts and Crafts), which established an official education in the fine arts and built the foundations of the current [[Escola Nacional de Belas Artes]] (School of Fine Arts).
[[Image:EscolaMusica-UFRJ-1.jpg|thumb|right|Music school of Federal University of Rio de Janeiro.]]
In the 19th century, the Portuguese royal family, headed by [[John VI of Portugal|D. João VI]], arrived in Rio de Janeiro, escaping from the [[Napoleon]]'s army invasion of Portugal in 1807. D. João VI gave impetus to the expansion of European civilization to Brazil. In the short period between 1808 and 1810, the [[Portuguese government]] founded the Academia Real dos Guarda Marinha (Royal Naval Academy), the Real Academia Militar (Royal Military Academy), the Biblioteca Nacional ([[National Library of Brazil]]), the Jardim Botânico do Rio de Janeiro ([[Rio de Janeiro Botanical Garden]]), the Academia Médico-Cirúrgica da [[Bahia]] (Medic-Cirurgical Academy of Bahia), now known as Faculdade de Medicina (Med School) in the Universidade Federal da Bahia ([[Federal University of Bahia]]) and the Academia Médico-Cirúrgica do Rio de Janeiro (Medic-Cirurgical Academy of Rio de Janeiro) which is now the medical school of the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro.

Brazil achieved [[Independence of Brazil|independence in 1822]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://library.brown.edu/create/fivecenturiesofchange/chapters/chapter-3/pedro-i-and-pedro-ii/|title=Pedro I and Pedro II {{!}} Brazil: Five Centuries of Change|website=library.brown.edu|access-date=2018-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Brazil Reader|last=Crocitti|first=John J.|last2=LeVine|first2=Robert A.|publisher=Duke University Press|year=1999|isbn=|location=Durham|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Until the 20th century, it was a large rural nation with low social and economic standards comparing to the average North American and European standards. Its economy was based on the [[primary sector]], possessing an unskilled and increasingly larger workforce, composed of free people (including slave owners) and [[Slavery in Brazil|slaves]] or their direct descendants. Among the first [[law school]]s founded in Brazil were the ones in [[Recife]] and [[São Paulo]] in 1827. But for decades to come, most Brazilian lawyers studied at European universities, such as in the ancient [[University of Coimbra]], in Portugal, which had awarded degrees to generations of Brazilian students since the 16th century.

In 1872 there were 9,930,478 inhabitants (84.8% free and 15.2% slave). According to the national census made in this year, among the free inhabitants (8,419,672 people), 38% were white, 39% mulattoes (white and black mix), 11% black and 5% caboclos (white and Indian mix). Only 23.4% of the free men and 13.4% of the free women could read and write. In 1889, six decades after independence, only 20% of the total population could read and write. In the former colonial power, Portugal, about 80% of the population was classified as illiterate.

With the massive [[Economic history of Brazil|post-war expansion]] that lasts to date, the government focused on strengthening Brazil's [[tertiary education]], while simultaneously neglecting assistance to primary and secondary education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mre.gov.br/cdbrasil/itamaraty/web/port/polsoc/educa/apresent/apresent.htm|title=Educação|website=Mre.gov.br|accessdate=2017-08-29|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061128080411/http://www.mre.gov.br/CDBRASIL/ITAMARATY/WEB/port/polsoc/educa/apresent/apresent.htm|archive-date=2006-11-28|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The problems of primary and secondary education were compounded by significant quality differences across regions, with the northeast suffering dramatically.&lt;ref&gt;Ralph Harbison and [[Eric Hanushek]], ''Educational performance of the poor: lessons from rural northeast Brazil'' (New York: Oxford University Press, 1992).&lt;/ref&gt; In the aftermath of [[Brazilian military government|Brazilian military rule]], education became seen as a way to create a fairer society. "Citizen schools" emerged, designed to promote critical thinking, incorporation of marginalized people, and curiosity (over rote memorization and obedience).&lt;ref&gt;Ignoramuses Academy, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, Brazil struggles to improve the public education offered at earlier stages and maintain the high standards that the population has come to expect from public universities. The choice on public funding is an issue. In particular, the [[Millennium Development Goals|U.N. Development Goal]] of [[Universal Primary Education]] and a larger offer of [[Special education|education for students with special needs]] are pursued by Brazilian policy-makers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://portal.mec.gov.br/seesp/arquivos/pdf/plano1.pdf|title=Plano Nacional de Educação Especial - Ministry of Education|website=Portal.mec.gov.br|accessdate=2017-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite its shortcomings, Brazil has progressed substantially since the 1980s. The nation witnessed an increase in school enrollment for children age 7–14, from 80.9% in 1980 to 96.4% in the year 2000. In the 15-17 age demographic, in the same period, this rate rose from 49.7% to 83%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edudatabrasil.inep.gov.br/|title=Edudata Brasil|website=Edudatabrasil.inep.gov.br|accessdate=2017-08-29|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061224064700/http://www.edudatabrasil.inep.gov.br/|archive-date=2006-12-24|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Literacy rates rose from 75% to 90.0%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ipea.gov.br/pub/td/td_99/td_639.pdf|format=PDF|title=COELHO DE SOUZA, Marcos Medeiros.

[[File:Constituição 1824 f 04.tif|thumb|213x213px|Constitution of 1824]]
Voting has been mandatory for all citizens of Brazil since the first [http://pdba.georgetown.edu/Constitutions/Brazil/brazil.html Constitution of 1824]. However, people who are illiterate have, historically, not been able to be registered to vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://pdba.georgetown.edu/Constitutions/Brazil/brazil.htm|title=Republica Federativa do Brasil/Federative Republic of Brazil: Constituições/Constitutions.|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=March 2018}}{{dead link|date=November 2018|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.constituteproject.org/constitution/Brazil_2014.pdf|title=Brazil’s Constitution of 1988 with Amendments through 2014|last=Rosenn|first=Keith S.|date=17 January 2018|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Constitution of Brazil|Constitution of 1988]] changed this, stating that those who are illiterate have the option to vote but it is not compulsory for those.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The Constitution of 1824 also stated that those who made less than 100,000 reis were not able to vote.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Throughout the 20th century, in response to campaigns occurring in other Latinoamérican countries, Brazilian states began their own literacy campaigns.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Paulo Freire &amp; the Cold War Politics of Literacy|last=Kirkendall|first=Andrew J.|publisher=The University of North Carolina Press|year=2010|isbn=|location=Chapel Hill, North Carolina|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Led by educators like [[Paulo Freire]], the campaigns hoped to combat the high amounts of illiteracy in the countryside. Beginning in 1963, the campaigns were centered in rural areas.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Paulo Freire’s methods were widely popular due to the immediacy in which they seemed to work: as he claimed, a student could learn to read and write in 40 hours.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The growing fear of [[communism]] and the rising power of the military led to the end of the campaigns in 1964 and the exile of Freire and others like him.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The [[Brazilian military regime|military government]] began new campaigns in the late 1970s to questionable improvements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/10/20/weekinreview/education-watch-illiteracy-resists-treatment-in-brazil.html|title=ILLITERACY RESISTS TREATMENT IN BRAZIL|last=Riding|first=Alan|date=1985|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Issues ==
According to PISA, the [[Programme for International Student Assessment]], Brazil, on average, underperforms. Brazilian students score lower than the average in reading, mathematics, and science, the three categories of testing.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.compareyourcountry.org/pisa/country/BRA|title=Brazil|last=|first=|date=|website=PISA 2015.|access-date=28 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their scores have improved since 2000, the first year the test was taken.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Since 2000, Brazil has started the [[Brazil Literate Program]] to lower the rate of illiteracy in those ages 15 and older.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://portal.mec.gov.br/programa-brasil-alfabetizado|title=Brazil Literate Program|last=|first=|date=|website=MInistry of Education|access-date=28 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brazil has also implemented the IDEP, the [[Index of Basic Education Development]], which evaluates school flow and performance rates in the test.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://portal.inep.gov.br/ideb|title=Ideb|last=|first=|date=20 October 2015|website=INEP|access-date=28 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the website, the index is used to tell whether the educational system should be improved.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The program is important in deciding public policy of the educational system.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; IDEP also led to the creation of the [[Mass mobilization|Social Mobilisation]] program which works to involve the entire community in the educational system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mse.mec.gov.br/index.php/92-destaque-principal/destaque/164-o-que-e-mobilizacao-social-pela-educacao|title=Social Mobilization for Education|last=|first=|date=2009|website=Ministry of Education|access-date=28 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several other committees have created programs in individual municipalities in order to curb the IDEP findings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=UNESCO|first=|date=2008|title=Youth and Adult Literacy in Brazil: Learning from Practice|url=|journal=|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It takes an extra three years to finish elementary school for low-income students, [http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/993851468014439962/pdf/656590REPLACEM0hieving0World0Class0.pdf PNAD], the national household survey, shows.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Achieving World-Class Education in Brazil: The Next Agenda|last=Bruns|first=Barbara|last2=Evans|first2=David|last3=Luque|first3=Javier|publisher=The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development|year=2012|isbn=|location=Washington D.C.|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Costs of finishing school rise each year until it is impossible to attend, meaning that low-income students also have the lowest rates for completing school.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Rio de Janeiro began a program in 2009 called the [[Reforço Escolar]] testing all students in the beginning of the school year to discover all who are not yet at grade level.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Those who are not receive two weeks of in-depth tutoring.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; [[São Paulo]] and [[Paraná (state)|Paraná]] have also created programs to help those who are behind, either due to being low-income or for other reasons.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

== Organization and structure ==
[[File:Educação no Brasil.png|thumb|Table showing how the education system is organized in Brazil]]
Education is divided into three levels, with grades in each level: 
* Pre-school education (educação infantil) is found in public institutions and private institutions.
* Basic education (ensino básico) is found in public institutions and private institutions, and mandatory for those between the ages of 6 and 17.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/leis/L9394.htm|title=L9394|website=Planalto.gov.br|access-date=2016-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|url=http://portal.mec.gov.br/dmdocuments/passo_a_passo_versao_atual_16_setembro.pdf|publisher=Ministério da Educaçao (Ministry of Education)|title=Ensino fundamental de nove anos: Passo a passo do processo de implementação|trans-title=Nine years secondary school: Implementation step by step|accessdate=2017-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; It consists of Elementary school (ensino fundamental) and High school (ensino médio)
* Higher education (ensino superior) (including graduate degrees) is found in public institutions and private institutions.

=== Pre-school education (educação infantil) ===
Pre-school education is optional and exists to aid in the development of children under 6. It aims to assist in all areas of child development, including motor skills, cognitive skills, and social skills while providing fertile ground for the later acquisition of knowledge and learning. There are day nurseries for children under 2, kindergartens for 2- to 3-year-olds, and preschools for children 4 and up. Public preschools are provided by city governments.

=== Elementary school (ensino fundamental) ===
Elementary school is mandatory for children ages 6–14. There are nine "years" (as opposed to the former eight "grades").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/folha/educacao/ult305u18335.shtml|title=Folha Online - Educação - Ensino fundamental de 9 anos beneficia estudantes mais pobres, diz Lula - 06/02/2006|website=Folha.uol.com.br|accessdate=2017-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The current "first year" broadly corresponds to the former pre-school last year of private institutions, and its aim is to achieve literacy. Generally speaking, the only prerequisite for enrolling in first year is that a child should be 6 years old, but some education systems allow children younger than 6 to enroll in first year (as long as they turn 6 during the first academic semester). Older students who have not completed their elementary education are allowed to attend, though those over 18 are separated from the younger children.

The National Council of Education (''Conselho Nacional de Educação'') establishes a core curriculum consisting of [[Portuguese language]], [[history]], [[geography]], [[science]], [[mathematics]], [[arts]] and [[physical education]] (for years 2, 3, 4 and 5). As for years 6, 7, 8 and 9, one or two foreign languages are also compulsory (usually English and an optional language).

Each education system supplements this core curriculum with a diversified curriculum defined by the needs of the region and the abilities of individual students.

Elementary education is divided in two stages, called ''Ensino Fundamental I'' (years 1–5) and ''Ensino Fundamental II'' (years 6–9). During ''Ensino Fundamental I'' each group of students is usually assisted by a single teacher. In ''Ensino Fundamental II'', there are as many teachers as subjects.

The length of the school year is set by the National Education Bases and Guidelines Law (''Lei de Diretrizes e Bases da Educação'') to at least 200 days. Elementary schools must provide students with at least 800 hours of activities per year. The school calendar is set by individual schools which, in rural areas, often organize their calendars according to planting and harvesting seasons.

Public elementary schools are funded by municipal and state governments. The education is similar to the British.

===High school (ensino médio){{anchor|High}}===
Students must have finished their elementary school before they enroll in high school. [[Secondary education]] takes three years. The minimum is 2,200 hours of teaching over four years. Secondary education [[core curriculum]] comprises Portuguese (including Portuguese language, essay studies, [[Brazilian literature|Brazilian]] and [[Portuguese literature]]s), foreign language (usually [[English language|English]], also [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and very rarely [[French language|French]]), [[History]], [[Geography]], [[Mathematics]], [[Physics]], [[Chemistry]] and [[Biology]]. [[Philosophy]] and [[Sociology]], which were banned during the [[Brazilian military dictatorship|military dictatorship]] (1964–1985), have become compulsory again.

High school education is provided by all levels of government.

===Technical education (ensino técnico)===
The movement of the eleventh or twelfth grade of high school or the end of those grades is mandatory for those wishing to pursue [[technical education]],&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://global.britannica.com/topic/technical-education|title=Technical education|website=Britannica.com|accessdate=2017-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; through courses in several areas of knowledge. In addition, students must pass a entrance examination for their specific course. These institutions usually have a greater number of hours per week. The instruction of the technical course lasts from one year and a half to two years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://agenciabrasil.ebc.com.br/educacao/noticia/2014-03/dilma-destaca-importancia-do-ensino-para-desenvolvimento-do-pais|title=Dilma destaca importância do ensino técnico para desenvolvimento do país|website=Ebc.com.br|accessdate=2017-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Higher education (ensino superior)===

In addition, students must pass a competitive entrance examination (known as ''[[vestibular]]'') for their specific course of study. The number of candidates per available place in the [[freshman]] class may be in excess of 30 or 40 to one in the not so competitive courses at the top public universities. The most competitive ones excess 80 or 150. In some courses with small number of vacancies, this number can be as high as 200 (medical school, for example).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cvu.uem.br/concorrencia.html|title=UEM/CVU - Cursos, Turnos e Vagas|website=Cvu.uem.br|accessdate=2017-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As is the case in many nations, higher education in Brazil can be divided into [[undergraduate]] and [[graduate school|graduate]] work. In addition to providing education, universities promote research and provide separate classes to the community. The Brazilian standard for [[technology]], [[Licentiate (degree)|licentiate]] or [[Bachelor's degree|bachelor's]] degree is awarded in most areas of the [[arts]], [[humanities]], [[social sciences]], [[exact sciences]], or [[natural sciences]], and lasts two to three years for technology courses, three to four years for licenciate and bachelor's courses in general and five to six years for special bachelor's courses such as [[law]], [[architecture]], [[engineering]], [[human medicine]] and [[veterinary medicine]].

After graduation students can take postgraduate courses being these latu sensu or stricto sensu. Latu sensu graduate degrees are specializations and refinements lasting one to two years and do not confer academic title. At the end of the course the student must present a course completion work. (Example of latu sensu: MBA, specialization, medical residency, among others). Graduate degrees stricto sensu are courses that confer academic title. After graduation, the student must do a master's degree with a duration of two years and after that period present a master's thesis. If it is approved by the examining board, it will receive the master's degree. The doctorate course in Brazil is the most academic degree course. In order to study this postgraduate course it is necessary to have the title of Master. The doctorate has a duration of four years and must be unpublished. After four years of course the student will present the doctoral thesis to an assessment bank, if approved will receive the title of Doctor.

There are more than 2,600 universities in Brazil, between private and public, according to MEC.

Researchers in this area may link basic findings in cognitive neuroscience with educational technology to help in [[curriculum]] implementation for [[mathematics education]] and [[reading education]]. The aim of educational neuroscience is to generate [[basic research|basic]] and [[applied research]] that will provide a new transdisciplinary account of [[learning]] and [[teaching]], which is capable of informing education. A major goal of educational neuroscience is to bridge the gap between the two fields through a direct dialogue between researchers and educators, avoiding the "middlemen of the brain-based learning industry". These middlemen have a vested commercial interest in the selling of "neuromyths" and their supposed remedies.&lt;ref name = Goswami2006 /&gt;

The potential of educational neuroscience has received varying degrees of support from both cognitive neuroscientists and educators. Davis&lt;ref name = Davis04&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Davis | first1 = A | year = 2004 | title = The credentials of brain-based learning | journal = Journal of the Philosophy of Education | volume = 38 | issue = 1 | pages = 21–36 | publisher = Wiley Interscience | doi = 10.1111/j.0309-8249.2004.00361.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; argues that medical models of cognition, "...have only a very limited role in the broader field of education and learning mainly because learning-related intentional states are not internal to individuals in a way which can be examined by brain activity". Pettito and Dunbar&lt;ref name = PetittoDunbar04&gt;{{cite conference | last1 = Petitto | first1 = LA | last2 = Dunbar | first2 = K | year = 2004 | title = New findings from educational neuroscience on bilingual brains, scientific brains, and the educated mind. | editor1-last = Fischer | editor1-first = K | editor2-last = Katzir | editor2-first = T | booktitle = Building Usable Knowledge in Mind, Brain, &amp; Education | publisher = Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; on the other hand, suggest that educational neuroscience "provides the most relevant level of analysis for resolving today’s core problems in education". Howard-Jones and Pickering&lt;ref name = DfESReport&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Howard-Jones | first1 = P |last2 = Pickering | first2 = S. |last3 = Diack | first3 = A | year = 2007 | title = Perception of the role of neuroscience in education.

Some researchers take an intermediate view and feel that a direct link from neuroscience to education is a "bridge too far",&lt;ref name=Bruer1997&gt;{{cite journal | last = Bruer | first = JT | year = 1997 | title = Education and the brain: A bridge too far | journal = Educational Researcher | volume = 26 | pages = 4–16 | doi=10.3102/0013189x026008004}}&lt;/ref&gt; but that a bridging discipline, such as cognitive psychology or educational psychology&lt;ref name = Mason2009&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.cortex.2008.06.003 | last = Mason | first = L. |year = 2009 | title = Bridging neuroscience and education: A two-way path is possible | journal = Cortex | publisher = Elsevier Science | volume = 45 | issue = 4 | pages = 548–549 | pmid = 18632093}}&lt;/ref&gt; can provide a neuroscientific basis for educational practice. The prevailing opinion, however, appears to be that the link between education and neuroscience has yet to realise its full potential, and whether through a third research discipline, or through the development of new neuroscience research paradigms and projects, the time is right to apply neuroscientific research findings to education in a practically meaningful way.&lt;ref name = AnsariCoch /&gt;&lt;ref name = Goswami2006 /&gt;&lt;ref name = MeltzoffScience09 /&gt;

Several academic institutions around the world are beginning to devote resources and energy to the establishment of research centres focused on educational neuroscience research. For example, the Centre for Educational Neuroscience in London UK is an inter-institutional project between [[University College, London]], [[Birkbeck, University of London|Birkbeck]] and the [[Institute of Education]]. The centre brings together researchers with expertise in the fields of emotional, conceptual, attentional, language and mathematical development, as well as specialists in education and learning research with the aim of building a new scientific discipline (Educational Neuroscience) in order to ultimately promote better learning.

==The need for a new discipline==
The emergence of educational neuroscience has been born out of the need for a new discipline that makes scientific research practically applicable in an educational context. Addressing the broader field of "mind, brain and education", Kurt Fischer states, "The traditional model will not work. It is not enough for researchers to collect data in schools and make those data and the resulting research papers available to educators",&lt;ref name = Fischer2009&gt;{{cite journal | last = Fischer | first = KW | year = 2009 | title = Mind, Brain, and Education:Building a scientific groundwork for learning and teaching | journal = Mind, Brain and Education | publisher = Wiley Periodicals | volume = 3 | issue = 1 | pages = 3–16 | url = http://gseweb.harvard.edu/~ddl/articlesCopy/FischerGroundwork.MBE2009.3.1.pdf | doi = 10.1111/j.1751-228X.2008.01048.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; as this method excludes teachers and learners from contributing to the formation of appropriate research methods and questions.

Learning in cognitive psychology and neuroscience has focused on how individual humans and other species have evolved to extract useful information from the natural and social worlds around them.&lt;ref name = Frith2007&gt;{{cite book | last = Frith |first = C | year = 2007 | title = Making Up the Mind: How the Brain Creates Our Mental World |publisher = Oxford: Blackwell | isbn = 978-1-4051-6022-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, education, and especially modern formal education, focuses on descriptions and explanations of the world that learners cannot be expected to acquire by themselves. In this way, learning in the scientific sense, and learning in the educational sense can be seen as complementary concepts. This creates a new challenge for cognitive neuroscience to adapt to the real world practical requirements of educational learning. Conversely, neuroscience creates a new challenge for education, because it provides new characterizations of the current state of the learner – including brain state, genetic state, and hormonal state - that could be relevant to learning and teaching. By providing new measures of the effects of learning and teaching, including brain structure and activity, it is possible to discriminate different types of learning method and attainment. For example, neuroscience research can already distinguish learning by rote from learning through conceptual understanding in mathematics.&lt;ref name = Ischebeck2006&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ischebeck | first1 = A. | last2 = Zamarian | year = 2006 | first2 = L | last3 = Siedentopf | first3 = C | last4 = Koppelstätter | first4 = F | last5 = Benke | first5 = T | last6 = Felber | first6 = S | last7 = Delazer | first7 = M | title = How specifically do we learn?

The [[United States National Academy of Sciences]] published an important report, stressing that, "Neuroscience has advanced to the point where it is time to think critically about the form in which research information is made available to educators so that it is interpreted appropriately for practice—identifying which research findings are ready for implementation and which are not."&lt;ref name = HowPeopleLearn&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Bransford | first1 = JD | last2 = Brown | first2 = AL | last3 = Cocking |first3 = RR | year = 2000 | title = How people learn : brain, mind, experience, and school (Expanded edition) | url = http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=6160 | publisher = Washington, DC: National Academy of Sciences: Committee on Developments in the Science of Learning and Committee on Learning Research and Educational Practice | isbn = 0-309-07036-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In their book ''The Learning Brain'', researchers from London’s "Centre for Educational Neuroscience", Blakemore &amp; Frith outline the developmental neurophysiology of the human brain that has given rise to many theories regarding educational neuroscience.&lt;ref name = BlakemoreFrithPrecis&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-7687.2005.00434.x | last1 = Blakemore |first1 = SJ |last2 = Frith |first2 = U |year = 2005 |title = The learning brain: lessons for education: a precis |journal = Developmental Science | volume = 8 | issue = 6 | pages = 459–465 | pmid = 16246234}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the fundamental pillars supporting the link between education and neuroscience is the ability of the brain to learn. Neuroscience is developing and increasing our understanding of early brain development, and how these brain changes might relate to learning processes.

==Early brain development==
{{main|Neural development}}

Almost all of the neurons in the brain are generated before birth, during the first three months of pregnancy, and the newborn child’s brain has a similar number of neurons to that of an adult. Many more neurons form than are needed, and only those that form active connections with other neurons survive. In the first year after birth the infant brain undergoes an intense phase of development, during which excessive numbers of connections between neurons are formed, and many of these excess connections must be cut back through the process of [[synaptic pruning]] that follows. This pruning process is just as important a stage of development as the early rapid growth of connections between brain cells. The process during which large numbers of connections between neurons are formed is called [[synaptogenesis]]. For vision and hearing (visual and auditory cortex), there is extensive early synaptogenesis. The density of connections peaks at around 150% of adult levels between four and 12 months, and the connections are then extensively pruned. Synaptic density returns to adult levels between two and four years in the visual cortex. For other areas such as prefrontal cortex (thought to underpin planning and reasoning), density increases more slowly and peaks after the first year. Reduction to adult levels of density takes at least another 10–20 years; hence there is significant brain development in the frontal areas even in adolescence. Brain metabolism (glucose uptake, which is an approximate index of synaptic functioning) is also above adult levels in the early years. Glucose uptake peaks at about 150% of adult levels somewhere around four to five years. By the age of around ten years, brain metabolism has reduced to adult levels for most cortical regions. Brain development consists of bursts of synaptogenesis, peaks of density, and then synapse rearrangement and stabilisation. This occurs at different times and different rates for different brain regions, which implies that there may be different sensitive periods for the development of different types of knowledge. Neuroscience research into early brain development has informed government education policy for children under three years old in many countries including the USA and the United Kingdom. These policies have focused on enriching the environment of children during nursery and preschool years, exposing them to stimuli and experiences thought to maximise the learning potential of the young brain.

==Can neuroscience inform education?==
Although an increasing number of researchers are seeking to establish educational neuroscience as a productive field of research, debate still continues with regards to the potential for practical collaboration between the fields of neuroscience and education, and whether neuroscientific research really has anything to offer educators.

He draws attention to the fact that behavioural research alone was not decisive in determining whether developmental dyslexia was a disorder of primarily visual or phonological origin.

While John Bruer&lt;ref name = Bruer1997 /&gt; suggests that the link between neuroscience and education is essentially impossible without a third field of research to link the two, other researchers feel that this view is too pessimistic. While acknowledging that more bridges must be built between basic neuroscience and education, and that so called neuromyths (see below) must be deconstructed, Usha Goswami&lt;ref name = Goswami2004&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Goswami | first1 = U | year = 2004 | title = Neuroscience and education | pages = 1–14 | journal = British Journal of Educational Psychology |volume = 74 | issue = 1 | doi = 10.1348/000709904322848798 | pmid = 15096296}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggests that cognitive developmental neuroscience has already made several discoveries of use to education, and has also led to the discovery of ‘neural markers’ that can be used to assess development. In other words, milestones of neural activity or structure are being established, against which an individual can be compared in order to assess their development.

For example, [[event-related potential]] (ERP) research has uncovered several neural signatures of language processing, including markers of semantic processing (e.g. N400), phonetic processing (e.g. mismatch negativity) and syntactic processing (e.g. P600). Goswami&lt;ref name = Goswami2004 /&gt; points out that these parameters can now be investigated longitudinally in children, and that certain patterns of change may indicate certain developmental disorders. Furthermore, the response of these neural markers to focused educational interventions may be used as a measure of the intervention’s effectiveness. Researchers such as Goswami assert that cognitive neuroscience has the potential to offer various exciting possibilities to education. For special education, these include the early diagnosis of special educational needs; the monitoring and comparison of the effects of different kinds of educational input on learning; and an increased understanding of individual differences in learning and the best ways to suit input to learner.&lt;ref name = Goswami2004 /&gt;

A potential application of neuroimaging highlighted by Goswami&lt;ref name = Goswami2004 /&gt; is in differentiating between delayed development and atypical development in learning disorders. For instance, is a given child with dyslexia developing reading functions in a totally different way from typical readers, or is he/she developing along the same trajectory, but just taking longer to do so? Indeed, evidence already exists to suggest that in children with specific language impairments and dyslexia the development of the language system is delayed rather than fundamentally different in nature.&lt;ref name = McArthur2004&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = McArthur | first1 = GM | last2 = Bishop |first2 = DVM | year = 2004 | title = Which people with specific language impairment have auditory processing deficits? |journal = Cognitive Neuropsychology | publisher = Psychology Press | pmid = 21038192 |volume = 21 |issue = 1 |pages = 79–94 | doi = 10.1080/02643290342000087}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = Thomson2005&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Thomson |first1 = J | last2 = Baldeweg | first2 = T | last3 = Goswami |first3 = U. | year = 2005 | title = Amplitude envelope onsets and dyslexia: a behavioural and electrophysiological study | journal = ISCA}}&lt;/ref&gt; In disorders such as autism however, brain development may be qualitatively different, showing a lack of development in brain regions associated with a "theory of mind".&lt;ref name = Frith1998&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Frith | first1 = U | last2 = Happe | first2 = F | year = 1998 | title = Why specific developmental disorders are not specific: On-line and developmental effects in autism and dyslexia | journal = Developmental Science | publisher = Blackwell Publishing | volume = 1 | issue = 2 | pages = 267–272 | doi = 10.1111/1467-7687.00041}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Goswami&lt;ref name = Goswami2004 /&gt; also suggests that neuroimaging could be used to assess the impact of particular training programmes, such as the Dore, an exercise based programme based on the cerebellar deficit hypothesis that aims to improve reading through a series of balance exercises. Some brain imaging research is beginning to show that for children with dyslexia who receive targeted educational interventions, their brain activation patterns begin to look more like those of people without reading disorders, and in addition, that other brain regions are acting as compensatory mechanisms.&lt;ref name = Shaywitz2003&gt;{{cite journal |last1 = Shaywitz |first1 = SE | last2 = Shaywitz | first2 = BA | last3 = Fulbright |first3 = RK | last4 = Skudlarski | first4 = P | last5 = Mencl |first5 = WE | last6 = Constable| first6 = RT | last7 = Pugh | first7 = KR | last8 = Holahan | first8 = JM | last9 = Marchione | first9 = KE | last10=Fletcher | first10=JM | last11=Lyon | first11=GR | last12=Gore | first12=JC | year = 2003 | title = Neural systems for compensation and persistence: Young adult outcome of childhood reading disability | journal = Biological Psychiatry | publisher = Elsevier Science | volume = 54 |pages = 25–33 | issue = 1 | doi = 10.1016/S0006-3223(02)01836-X | pmid = 12842305}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = Temple2003&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Temple | first1 = E | last2 = Deutsch | first2 = GK | last3 = Poldrack | first3 = RA | last4 = Miller | first4 = SL | last5 = Tallal | first5 = P | last6 = Merzenich | first6 = MM | last7 = Gabrieli | first7 = JD | year = 2003 | title = Neural deficits in children with dyslexia ameliorated by behavioral remediation: Evidence from functional MRI |journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |volume = 100 | issue = 5 |pages = 2860–2865 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0030098100 | pmc = 151431 | pmid = 12604786}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such findings may help educators understand that, even if dyslexic children show behavioural improvement, the neural and cognitive mechanisms by which they process written information may still be different, and this may have practical implications for the ongoing instruction of these children.&lt;ref name = Katzir2006&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Katzir | first1 = T | last2 = Pare-Blagoev | first2 = J | year = 2006 | title = Applying cognitive neuroscience research to education: The case of literacy | pages = 53–74 | journal = Educational Psychologist |volume = 41 | issue = 1 | doi = 10.1207/s15326985ep4101_6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Neuroscience research has evidenced its ability to reveal ‘neural markers’ of learning disorders, most notably in the case of dyslexia. EEG studies have revealed that human infants at risk of dyslexia (i.e. with immediate family members who suffer from dyslexia) show atypical neural responses to changes in speech sounds, even before they are able to understand the semantic content of language.&lt;ref name = Guttorm2005&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Guttorm | first1 = TK | last2 = Leppänen | first2 = PH | last3 = Poikkeus | first3 = AM | last4 = Eklund | first4 = KM | last5 = Lyytinen | first5 = P | last6 = Lyytinen | first6 = H | title = Brain event-related potentials (ERPs) measured at birth predict later language development in children with and without familial risk for dyslexia | journal = Cortex | publisher = Elsevier Science | volume = 41 | issue = 3 | year = 2005 | pages = 291–303 | doi = 10.1016/S0010-9452(08)70267-3 | pmid = 15871595}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not only does such research allow for the early identification of potential learning disorders, but it further supports the phonological hypothesis of dyslexia in a manner unavailable to behavioural research.

Many researchers advocate a cautious optimism with regards to the marriage between education and neuroscience, and believe that to bridge the gap between the two, the development of new experimental paradigms is necessary and that these new paradigms should be designed to capture the relationships between neuroscience and education across different levels of analysis (neuronal, cognitive, behavioural).&lt;ref name = Katzir2006 /&gt;

Mathematical skills are important not only for the national economy but also for an individual’s life chances: low numeracy increases the probability of arrest, depression, physical illnesses, unemployment.&lt;ref name = Parsons&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Parsons | first1 = S | last2 = Bynner | first2 = J | year = 2005 | title = Does numeracy matter more? | url = http://www.nrdc.org.uk/download.asp?f=2979&amp;e=pdf | publisher = National Research and Development Centre for Adult Literacy and Numeracy, Institute of Education, UK | postscript = &lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

As the Foresight report on Mental Capital and Wellbeing puts it, "Developmental dyscalculia – because of its low profile but high impacts, its priority should be raised. Dyscalculia relates to numeracy and affects between 4-7% of children. It has a much lower profile than dyslexia but can also have substantial impacts: it can reduce lifetime earnings by £114,000 and reduce the probability of achieving five or more [[GCSE]]s (A*-C) by 7–20 percentage points. Home and school interventions have again been identified by the Project. Also, technological interventions are extremely promising, offering individualised instruction and help, although these need more development."

This suggestion that dyscalculia is caused by a deficits in a core deficit in number sense is analogous to the theory that dyslexia is due to a core deficit in phonological processing. Despite these similarities in terms of the scientific progress, public awareness of dyscalculia is much lower than it is for dyslexia. The [[Chief Scientific Adviser to HM Government|UK's Chief Scientific Advisor]], [[John Beddington]], notes that, "developmental dyscalculia is currently the poor relation of dyslexia, with a much lower public profile.

The application of neuroscience to understanding mathematical processing has already resulted in understanding beyond the early cognitive theories. Cognitive neuroscience research has revealed the existence of an innate ‘number sense’ system, present in animals and infants as well as adults, that is responsible for basic knowledge about numbers and their relations. This system is located in the parietal lobe of the brain in each hemisphere.&lt;ref name = Dehaene2003 /&gt;&lt;ref name = Dehaene1998&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dehaene | first1 = S | last2 = Dehaene-Lambertz | first2 = G | last3 = Cohen | first3 = L | title = Abstract representations of numbers in the animal and human brain | url = http://www.unicog.org/publications/Dehaene_ReviewNumbersAnimalsInfants_TINS1998.pdf | journal = Trends in Neurosciences | publisher = Elsevier Science | volume = 21 | pages = 355–361 | year = 1998 | issue = 8 | doi = 10.1016/S0166-2236(98)01263-6 | pmid = 9720604}}&lt;/ref&gt; This parietal system is active in children and adults during basic numerical tasks,&lt;ref name = Temple1998&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1073/pnas.95.13.7836 | last1 = Temple | first1 = E | last2 = Posner | first2 = MI | year = 1998 | title = Brain mechanisms of quantity are similar in 5-year-old children and adults | url = http://www.pnas.org/content/95/13/7836.full.pdf | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the USA | volume = 95 | issue = 13 | pages = 7836–7841 | pmid = 9636237 | pmc = 22775}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = Ansari2005&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1097/01.wnr.0000183905.23396.f1 | last1 = Ansari | first1 = D | last2 = Garcia | first2 = N | last3 = Lucas | first3 = E | last4 = Hamon | first4 = K | last5 = Dhital | first5 = B | year = 2005 | title = Neural correlates of symbolic number processing in children and adults | journal = NeuroReport | volume = 16 | issue = 16 | pages = 1769–1773 | pmid = 16237324}}&lt;/ref&gt; but over the course of development it appears to become more specialised.

While many arithmetic problems are so over learned that they are stored as verbal facts, other more complex problems require some form of visuo-spatial mental imagery.&lt;ref name = Zago2001&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Zago | first1 = L | last2 = Pesenti | first2 = M | last3 = Mellet | first3 = E | last4 = Crivello | first4 = F | last5 = Mazoyer | first5 = B | last6 = Tzourio-Mazoyer | first6 = N | year = 2001 | title = Neural correlates of simple and complex mental calculation | journal = NeuroImage | publisher = Elsevier Science 2001 | volume = 13 | issue = 2 | pages = 314–327 | doi = 10.1006/nimg.2000.0697 | pmid = 11162272}}&lt;/ref&gt; Showing that these subsets of arithmetic skills are supported by different brain mechanisms offers the opportunity for a deeper understanding of the learning processes required to acquire arithmetic proficiency.

Neuroimaging studies of mathematical learning disabilities are still rare but dyscalculia is an area of increasing interest for neuroscience researchers. Since different neural mechanisms contribute to different elements of mathematical performance, it may be that children with dyscalculia show variable patterns of abnormality at the brain level. For example, many children with dyscalculia also have dyslexia, and those that do may show different activation of the verbal networks that support maths, while those who have dyscalculia only, may show impairments of the parietal number sense system. Indeed, the few studies carried out on children with dyscalculia only point to a brain level impairment of the number sense system.&lt;ref name = Price2007 /&gt;&lt;ref name = Kucian2006&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kucian | first1 = K | last2 = Loenneker | first2 = T | last3 = Dietrich | first3 = T | last4 = Dosch | first4 = M | last5 = Martin | first5 = E | last6 = von Aster | first6 = M | year = 2006 | title = Impaired neural networks for approximate calculation in dyscalculic children: a functional MRI study | url = http://www.behavioralandbrainfunctions.com/content/2/1/31 | journal = Behavioral and Brain Functions | publisher = BioMed Central Ltd. | volume = 2 | page = 31 | doi = 10.1186/1744-9081-2-31 | pmc = 1574332 | pmid = 16953876 | issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Such evidence is beginning to contribute to a theoretical debate between researchers who believe that dyscalculia is caused by a brain level deficit of the number sense and those who believe that the disorder stems from a problem in using numerical symbols to access the number sense information. With the continued development of theoretical models of dyscalculia that generate explicit testable hypotheses, progress should be rapid in developing research which investigates the link between mathematical learning disorders and their neural correlates.&lt;ref name = Willingham2009 /&gt;

===Social and emotional cognition===
{{Main|Social neuroscience}}

In the last 10 years, there has been an explosion of interest in the role of emotional abilities and characteristics in contributing to success in all aspects of life. The concept of [[Emotional Intelligence]] (EI)&lt;ref&gt;Salovey, P. and D.J. Sluyter, Emotional development and emotional intelligence: Educational implications. 1997: Basic Books.&lt;/ref&gt; has gained wide recognition and is featured in the Foresight report on Mental Capital and Wellbeing. Some have made influential claims that EI is more important than conventional cognitive intelligence, and that it can more easily be enhanced.&lt;ref&gt;Goleman, D., Emotional intelligence. New York, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; Systematic research has yet to provide much support for these claims, although EI has been found to be associated with academic success&lt;ref name = Goswami2006 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Petrides, K.V., N. Frederickson, and A. Furnham, The role of trait emotional intelligence in academic performance and deviant behavior at school. Personality and individual differences, 2004. 36(2): p. 277-293.&lt;/ref&gt; and there is some evidence that it may be of particular importance for groups at-risk of academic failure and social exclusion. In spite of the weak evidence base, there has been a focus on promoting the social and emotional competence, mental health and psychological wellbeing of children and young people,&lt;ref&gt;Appleby, L., S. Shribman, and N. Eisenstadt, Promoting the mental health and psychological wellbeing of children and young people. Report on the Implementation of Standard, 2006. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; particularly in schools as the result of the investment in universal services, prevention and early intervention (e.g., the Social and Emotional Aspects of Learning (SEAL) project in the UK [DfES, 2005, 2007]).

The neural basis of emotional recognition in typically developing children&lt;ref&gt;Herba, C. and M. Phillips, Annotation: Development of facial expression recognition from childhood to adolescence: Behavioural and neurological perspectives. Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry, 2004. 45(7): p. 1185-1198.&lt;/ref&gt; has been investigated, although there is little neuroimaging work on atypically developing children who process emotions differently.&lt;ref name = Goswami2006 /&gt; Males are commonly over-represented in these atypically developing populations and a female advantage is commonly reported both on EI measures and on most areas of emotion processing. In processing facial expressions the female advantage appears best explained by an integrated account considering both brain maturation and social interaction.&lt;ref&gt;McClure, E.B., A meta-analytic review of sex differences in facial expression processing and their development in infants, children, and adolescents. Psychological Bulletin, 2000. 126(3): p. 424-453.&lt;/ref&gt;

Prefrontal brain damage in children affects social behavior, causing insensitivity to social acceptance, approval or rejection.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, S.W., et al., Impairment of social and moral behavior related to early damage in human prefrontal cortex. Foundations of Social Neuroscience, 2002: p. 333–343.&lt;/ref&gt; These brain areas process social emotions such as embarrassment, compassion and envy. Moreover, such damage impairs cognitive as well as social decision making in real world contexts&lt;ref name = Kucian2006/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Damasio, A.R., The neurobiological grounding of human values. Changeux JP, et al (ed) Neurobiology of human values, in Neurobiology of human values J.P. Changeux, et al., Editors. 2005, London: Springer-Verlag. p. 47-56.&lt;/ref&gt; supporting the Vygotskian view that social and cultural factors are important in cognitive learning and decision making. This view emphasizes the importance of bringing together neuroscientific and [[social constructionist]] perspectives, in this case in examining the influence of emotion on transferable learning.&lt;ref&gt;Immordino-Yang, M.H. and A. Damasio, We feel, therefore we learn: The relevance of affective and social neuroscience to education. Mind, Brain, and Education, 2007. 1(1): p. 3-10.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, there are currently many gaps in the attempt to bring together developmental science and neuroscience to produce a more complete understanding of the development of awareness and empathy.&lt;ref&gt;Decety, J. and M. Meyer, From emotion resonance to empathic understanding: A social developmental neuroscience account. Development and Psychopathology, 2008. 20(04): p. 1053-1080.&lt;/ref&gt; Educational research relies on pupil's accurate self-report of emotion, which may not be possible for some pupils, e.g., those with alexithymia—a difficulty in identifying and describing feelings, which is found in 10% of typical adults. Emotional awareness can be measured using neuroimaging methods&lt;ref&gt;Silani, G., et al., The neurophysiological bases of inner emotional experience in autism spectrum disorders: an fMRI investigation. Social Neuroscience, 2008. 3(2): p. 97-112.&lt;/ref&gt; that show that differing levels of emotional awareness are associated with differential activity in amygdala, anterior insular cortex, and the medial prefrontal cortex. Studies of brain development in childhood and adolescence show that these areas undergo large-scale structural changes.&lt;ref&gt;Lenroot, R.K. and J.N. Giedd, Brain development in children and adolescents: insights from anatomical magnetic resonance imaging. Neuroscience and Biobehavioral Reviews, 2006. 30(6): p. 718-729.&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, the degree to which school-age children and young adults are aware of their emotions may vary across this time period, which may have an important impact on classroom behaviour and the extent to which certain teaching styles and curriculum approaches might be effective.

Neuroimaging work is also beginning to help in the understanding of social conduct disorders in children. For example, callous-unemotional traits in children are a particularly difficult problem for teachers to deal with, and represent a particularly serious form of conduct disturbance. Jones et al. (2009)&lt;ref&gt;Jones, A.P., et al., Amygdala hypoactivity to fearful faces in boys with conduct problems and callous-unemotional traits. American Journal of Psychiatry, 2009. 166(1): p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt; showed that children with callous-unemotional traits revealed less brain activation in the right amygdala in response to fearful faces, suggesting that the neural correlates of that type of emotional disturbance are present early in development.

Researchers from the Centre for Educational Neuroscience in London have been instrumental in developing a research body that investigates how social cognition develops in the brain. In particular, Sarah-Jayne Blakemore, co-author of "The Learning Brain", has published influential research on brain development related to social cognition during adolescence. Her research, suggests that activity in brain regions associated with emotional processing undergo significant functional changes during adolescence.&lt;ref&gt;Blakemore, S.J., The social brain in adolescence. Nature Reviews Neuroscience, 2008. 9(4): p. 267-277.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Attention and executive control===
Attention refers to the brain mechanisms that allow us to focus on particular aspects of the sensory environment to the relative exclusion of others. Attention modulates [[sensory processing]] in "top-down" fashion. Maintaining selective attention toward a particular item or person for a prolonged period is clearly a critical underpinning skill for the classroom. Attention is the key cognitive skill impaired in ADHD resulting in difficulty in completing tasks or attending to details.&lt;ref&gt;Ronald, A., et al., Evidence for overlapping genetic influences on autistic and ADHD behaviours in a community twin sample. Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry, 2008. 49(5): p. 535-542.&lt;/ref&gt; Aspects of attention may also be atypical in children showing anti-social behaviour and conduct disorders. From the perspective of basic neuroscience, recent evidence suggests that attention skills may be one of the human brain functions that respond best to early intervention and training (e.g.&lt;ref&gt;Holmboe, K. and M.H. Johnson, Educating executive attention. 2005, National Acad Sciences. p. 14479-14480.&lt;/ref&gt;).

Further, from a [[Neuroconstructivism|neuroconstructivist]] perspective attention is a vital mechanism through which the child can actively select particular aspects of their environment for further learning. Executive functions include the abilities to inhibit unwanted information or responses, to plan ahead for a sequence of mental steps or actions, and to retain task-relevant and changing information for brief periods (working memory).&lt;ref&gt;Kirkham, N.Z. and A. Diamond, Sorting between theories of perseveration: performance in conflict tasks requires memory, attention and inhibition. Developmental Science, 2003. 6(5): p. 474-476.&lt;/ref&gt; Like attention, executive function abilities provide a critical platform for the acquisition of domain-specific knowledge and skills in an educational context. Further, recent studies show that preschool training of executive skills may prevent early school failure.&lt;ref&gt;Diamond, A., et al., Preschool program improves cognitive control. Science, 2007. 318(5855): p. 1387-1388.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Blair, C. and A. Diamond, Biological processes in prevention and intervention: The promotion of self-regulation as a means of preventing school failure. Development and psychopathology, 2008. 20(03): p. 899-911.&lt;/ref&gt; Children with ADHD, anti-social behaviour, conduct disorders and autism can all show atypical patterns of executive function. Basic neuroscience studies have identified the primary brain structures and circuits involved in executive functions, including the prefrontal cortex, in adults. However, much research remains to be done to understand the development of this circuitry, and the genetic and neural bases of individual differences in executive function.&lt;ref&gt;Blakemore, S.J. and S. Choudhury, Development of the adolescent brain: implications for executive function and social cognition. Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry, 2006. 47(3-4): p. 296-312.&lt;/ref&gt; Foresight Mental Capital and Wellbeing Project specifically identifies and highlights the importance of attention and executive function skills in the future challenges for difficulties in learning (sections 2.2.4 and 2.4 in "Learning Difficulties: Future Challenges").

==Neuroscience and education: A bridge too far?==
{{original synthesis|date=October 2013}}
Despite optimism from many who believe that neuroscience can make a meaningful contribution to education and that the potential exists for the establishment of a research field of educational neuroscience, some researchers believe that the differences between the two disciplines are too great for them to ever be directly linked in a practically meaningful way. In 1997 John Bruer published a major critique of what he called the "Neuroscience and education argument".&lt;ref name = Bruer1997 /&gt;

The ‘neuroscience and education argument’ as Bruer defines it, stems from three major findings in developmental neurobiology.
# Early childhood is characterised by rapid growth in the number of synapses in the brain (synaptogenesis), and this expansion is followed by a pruning period.
# There are so called experience dependant critical periods during which the developing brain is best suited to develop certain sensory and motor skills.
# A stimulus rich environment causes greater synaptogenesis. The essential argument is that children are capable of learning more at an early age when they have an excess of synaptic growth and peak brain activity.

The knowledge of early brain development afforded by neurobiology has been used to support various arguments with regards to education. For example, the idea that any subject can be taught to young children in some intellectually honest form, due to the great adaptability and learning potential of the young brain.&lt;ref&gt;Hirsch, E.D., The schools we need and why we don't have them. 1996: Doubleday Books.&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, the idea that critical periods exist for learning certain skills or knowledge sets appeals to the fact that in animal studies, if the developing brain is deprived of certain sensory inputs, the brain areas responsible for processing those inputs fail to develop fully later in development, and thus "if you miss the window, you are playing with a handicap".&lt;ref&gt;Begley, S., Your child's brain. NEWSWEEK-AMERICAN EDITION-, 1996. 127: p. 54-57.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of Bruer’s major points of contention with reports in favour of neuroscience and education is the lack of actual neuroscience evidence. Reports such as Years of Promise: A Comprehensive Learning Strategy for America's Children (Carnegie Corporation of New York, 1996) cite many cognitive and behavioural psychology studies, but no more than a handful of brain based studies, and yet draws dramatic inferences with regards to the role of the brain in learning.

Bruer argues that behavioural science can provide a basis for informing educational policy, but the link to neuroscience is "a bridge too far", and the limitations of the application of neuroscience to education stem from the limitations of neuroscience knowledge itself. Bruer supports his critique by arguing the limitations of current knowledge regarding the three key tenets of the neuroscience and education argument. See Neuromyths.

Another problem is the discrepancy between spatial resolution of imaging methods and the spatial resolution of synaptic changes that are suggested to underlie learning processes. A similar problem is true with regards to the temporal resolution. This makes it hard to relate subcomponents of cognitive skills to brain function. However, the primary flaw of the education neuroscience argument in Bruer’s opinion is that it attempts to link what happens at the synaptic level to higher order learning and instruction.
The terminology, "Mind, brain and education" alludes to the idea that if we cannot bridge education and neuroscience directly, then we can use two existing connections to inform education. These are the link between cognitive psychology and education, and between cognitive psychology and neuroscience.

Bruer contends that neuroscience in its current form has little to offer educators at the practical level. Cognitive science on the other hand, can serve as a basis for the development of an applied science of learning and education. Other researchers have suggested alternative bridges to the cognitive psychology suggested by Bruer.&lt;ref name = Bruer1997 /&gt; Mason&lt;ref name = Mason2009 /&gt; suggests that the gap between education and neuroscience can be best bridged by educational psychology, which she outlines as being concerned with "developing descriptive, interpretive and prescriptive models of student learning and other educational phenomena".

===Challenges to educational neuroscience===
Despite Willingham’s assertion&lt;ref name = Willingham2009 /&gt; that the potential for neuroscience to contribute to educational practice and theory is already beyond doubt, he highlights three challenges that must be overcome to marry the two disciplines effectively.

The '''Goals Problem''': Willingham suggests that education is a so-called "artificial science" that seeks to construct an ‘artifact’, in this case a set of pedagogic strategies and materials. Neuroscience, on the other hand is a so-called "natural science", concerned with the discovery of natural principles that describe neural structure and function. This difference means that some goals set by education are simply impossible to answer using neuroscience research, for example, the building of character or aesthetic sense in children.

The '''Vertical Problem''': Levels of analysis: Willingham suggests that the highest level of analysis employed by neuroscientists is the mapping of brain structure and activity onto cognitive function, or even the interaction of cognitive functions (i.e. the impact of emotion on learning). Within neuroscience research these functions are studied in isolation for the sake of simplicity, and the nervous system as a whole, functioning in its entirety with all its huge composition of functional interactions, is not considered. For educators, on the other hand, the lowest level of analysis would be the mind of a single child, with levels increasing to incorporate the classroom, neighborhood, country etc.

Thus, importing research about a single cognitive factor in isolation, into a field in which context is essentially important creates an inherent difficulty. For example, while rote learning may be shown to improve learning in the research laboratory, the teacher cannot implement that strategy without considering the impact on the child’s motivation. In return, it is difficult for neuroscientists to characterize such interactions in a research setting.

The '''Horizontal Problem''': Translating research findings: While education theory and data are almost exclusively behavioral, findings from neuroscience research can take on many forms (e.g. electrical, chemical, spatial, temporal etc.). The most common form of data taken from neuroscience to education is the spatial mapping of brain activation to cognitive function. Willingham (2009) highlights the difficulty in applying such spatial information to educational theory. If a certain brain region is known to support a cognitive function relevant for education, what can actually be done with that information? Willingham suggests that this ‘horizontal problem’ can be solved only when a rich body of behavioral data and theories already exist,&lt;ref&gt;Willingham, D.T. and J.W. Lloyd, How educational theories can use neuroscientific data. Journal Compilation. 1(3): p. 140-149.&lt;/ref&gt; and points out that such methods have already been successful in identifying subtypes of dyslexia (e.g.&lt;ref name='Heim'&gt;{{Cite journal |vauthors=Heim S, Tschierse J, Amunts K |title=Cognitive subtypes of dyslexia |journal=Acta Neurobiologiae Experimentalis |volume=68 |issue=1 |pages=73–82 |year=2008 |pmid=18389017 |url=http://www.ane.pl/linkout.php?pii=6809 |issn=0065-1400}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shaywitz, B.A., G.R. Lyon, and S.E. Shaywitz, The role of functional magnetic resonance imaging in understanding reading and dyslexia. Developmental Neuropsychology, 2006. 30(1): p. 613-632.&lt;/ref&gt;).

Willingham suggests that what is essential for a successful union of neuroscience and education is that both fields have realistic expectations of one another. For example, educators should not expect that neuroscience will provide prescriptive answers for educational practice, answers for educational goals that are incompatible with neuroscientific methods (e.g. aesthetic training), or levels of analysis beyond the individual level. Finally Willingham suggests that neuroscience will only be useful to educators when targeted at a specific problem at a fine grained level of analysis, such as how people read, but that these data will only be useful in the context of well developed behavioral theories.

Other researchers, such as Katzir &amp; Pareblagoev&lt;ref name = Katzir2006 /&gt; have pointed out that neuroimaging methodology as it stands may not be suitable for the examination of higher level cognitive functions, because it relies primarily on the ‘subtraction method’. By this method, brain activity during a simple control task is subtracted from that of a ‘higher order’ cognitive task, thus leaving the activation that is related specifically to the function of interest. Katzir &amp; Pareblagoev suggest that while this method may be very good for examining low level processing, such as perception, vision and touch, it is very hard to design an effective control task for higher order processing, such as comprehension in reading and inference making. Thus, some researchers&lt;ref&gt;Palmer, E.D., et al., Investigation of the functional neuroanatomy of single word reading and its development. Scientific Studies of Reading, 2004. 8(3): p. 203-223.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Caplan, D., Functional neuroimaging studies of written sentence comprehension. Scientific Studies of Reading, 2004. 8(3): p. 225-240.&lt;/ref&gt; argue that functional imaging technologies may not be best suited for the measurement of higher order processing. Katzir &amp; Pareblagoev, suggest that this may not be a deficit of the technology itself, but rather of the design of experiments and the ability to interpret the results. The authors advocate using experimental measures in the scanner for which the behavioural data is already well understood, and for which there exists a strong theoretical framework.

===Transforming challenges into opportunities===
Another recent review of the educational neuroscience debate by Varma, McCandliss and Schwartz&lt;ref&gt;Varma, S., B.D. McCandliss, and D.L. Schwartz, Scientific and pragmatic challenges for bridging education and neuroscience. Educational Researcher, 2008. 37(3): p. 140.&lt;/ref&gt; focuses on eight primary challenges, divided into scientific challenges and practical challenges, facing the field, and attempts to transform those challenges into opportunities.

====Scientific challenges====
'''Methods''': Neuroscience methods create artificial environments and thus cannot provide useful information about classroom contexts. Furthermore, the concern is that if neuroscience begins to influence educational practice too heavily, there may be a de-emphasis of contextual variables, and solutions to educational problems may become primarily biological rather than instructional. However, Varma et al. argue that novel experimental paradigms create the opportunity to investigate context, such as brain activation following different learning procedures&lt;ref&gt;Delazer, M., et al., Learning by strategies and learning by drill--evidence from an fMRI study. Neuroimage, 2005. 25(3): p. 838-49.&lt;/ref&gt; and that neuroimaging can also allow for the examination of strategic/mechanistic developmental changes that cannot be tapped by reaction time and behavioural measures alone. Furthermore, Varma et al. cite recent research that shows that the effects of cultural variables can be investigated using brain imaging (e.g.&lt;ref&gt;Tang, Y., et al., Arithmetic processing in the brain shaped by cultures. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 2006. 103(28): p. 10775-80.&lt;/ref&gt;), and the results used to draw implications for classroom practice.

'''Data''': Knowing the brain region that supports an elementary cognitive function tells us nothing about how to design instruction for that function. However, Varma et al. suggest that neuroscience provide the opportunity for a novel analyses of cognition, breaking down behaviour into elements invisible at the behavioural level. For example, the question of whether different arithmetic operations show different speed and accuracy profiles is the result of different efficiency levels within one cognitive system versus the use of different cognitive systems.

'''Reductionist Theories''': Applying neuroscience terminology and theory to educational practice is a reduction and is of no practical use to educators. Nothing is gained be redescribing a behavioural deficit in neuroscientific terms. Varma et al. point out that reductionism is a mode by which sciences are unified, and that the co-opting of neuroscience terminology does not necessitate the elimination of education terminology, it simply provides the opportunity for interdisciplinary communication and understanding.

'''Philosophy''': Education and neuroscience are fundamentally incompatible, because attempting to describe behavioural phenomena in the classroom by describing physical mechanisms of the individual brain is logically wrong. However, neuroscience may help to resolve internal conflicts within education resulting from differing theoretical constructs and terminologies used within subfields of education by providing a measure of uniformity with regards to results reporting.

====Pragmatic concerns====
'''Costs''': Neuroscience methods are highly expensive, and the expected outcomes do not justify the costs. However, Varma et al. point out that educationally relevant neuroscience may attract addition funding to education research rather than usurping resources. The essential claim of educational neuroscience is that the two fields are interdependent and that a portion of the funding allocated collectively to the two fields should be directed towards shared questions.

'''Timing''': Neuroscience, while expanding rapidly, is still in relative infancy with regards to the non-invasive study of healthy brains, and thus education researchers should wait until more data is collected and distilled into succinct theories. Contrary to this, Varma et al. argue that some success is already evident. For example, studies examining the success of dyslexia remediation programmes&lt;ref&gt;Eden, G.F., et al., Neural changes following remediation in adult developmental dyslexia. Neuron, 2004. 44(3): p. 411-22.&lt;/ref&gt; have been able to reveal the impact of these programmes on the brain networks supporting reading. This in turn leads to the generation of new research questions.

'''Control''': If education allows neuroscience in the door, theories will increasingly be cast in terms of neural mechanisms and debates will rely increasingly on neuroimaging data. Neuroscience will cannibalise resources and education research will lose its independence. Varma et al. argue that the assumption of an asymmetric relationship between the two fields is unnecessary. Education has the potential to influence neuroscience, directing future research into complex forms of cognition and education researchers can help Educational Neuroscience to avoid naïve experiments and repetition of earlier mistakes.

'''Neuromyths''': Thus far most of the neuroscience findings applied to education have turned out to be neuromyths, irresponsible extrapolations of basic research to education questions. Furthermore, such neuromyths have escaped beyond academia and are being marketed directly to teachers, administrators and the public. Varma et al. respond that the existence of neuromyths reveals a popular fascination with brain function. Appropriate translation of educational neuroscience results and well established collaborative research can decrease the likelihood of neuromyths.

===A bidirectional relationship===
Researchers such as Katzir &amp; Pareblagoev&lt;ref name = Katzir2006 /&gt; and Cacioppo &amp; Berntson (1992)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Cacioppo, J.T. and G.G. Berntson|title=Social psychological contributions to the decade of the brain. Doctrine of multilevel analysis|journal=The American Psychologist|year=1992|volume=47|issue=8|pages=1019–28|url=http://psychology.uchicago.edu/people/faculty/cacioppo/jtcreprints/cb92.pdf|format=PDF|pmid=1510329|doi=10.1037/0003-066x.47.8.1019}}&lt;/ref&gt; argue that as well as neuroscience informing education, the educational research approach can contribute to the development of new experimental paradigms in neuroscience research. Katzir and Pareblagoev (2006) suggest the example of dyslexia research as a model of how this bidirectional collaboration might be achieved. In this case, theories of reading processes have guided both the design and interpretation of neuroscience research, but the existing theories were developed primarily from behavioural work. The authors suggest that the establishment of theories, which delineate required skills and subskills for educationally relevant tasks, is an essential requirement for educational neuroscience research to be productive. Furthermore, such theories need to suggest empirically testable connections between educationally relevant behaviours and brain function.

===The role of educators===
Kurt Fischer, director of Harvard University’s Mind, Brain and Education graduate program states "One of the reasons there is so much junk out there is that there are so few people who know enough about education and neuroscience to put the thing together".&lt;ref&gt;Strauss, V., Starting where science meets education., in Washington Post. 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; Educators have been reliant upon others’ expertise for the interpretations from Neuroscience hence have not been able to discern whether the claims made are valid or invalid representations of the research. Without a direct access to the primary research educators may be at risk of misusing results from neuroscience research.&lt;ref&gt;Greenwood, R., Where are the educators? What is our role in the debate? Cortex, 2009. 45: p. 552-554.&lt;/ref&gt; The need for so called ‘middlemen’ in the translation of research to practice has led to a situation where the application of cognitive neuroscience research findings is running ahead of the research itself.

In order to negate the need for middlemen, some researchers have suggested the need to developed a group of ''neuro-educators'', a specially trained class of professionals whose role would be to guide the introduction of cognitive neuroscience into educational practice in a ''sensible and ethical manner''. Neuro-educators would play a pivotal role in assessing the quality of evidence purporting to be relevant to education, assessing who is best placed to employ newly developed knowledge, and with what safeguards, and how to deal with unexpected consequences of implemented research findings.&lt;ref&gt;Sheridan, K., E. Zinchenko, and H. Gardner, Neuroethics in Education. Unpublished Manuscript, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

Byrnes &amp; Fox (1998)&lt;ref&gt;Byrnes, J.P. and N.A. Fox, The educational relevance of research in cognitive neuroscience. ''[[Educational Psychology Review]]'', 1998. 10(3): p. 297-342.&lt;/ref&gt; have suggested that developmental psychologists, educational psychologists and teachers generally fall into one of four orientations with respect to neuroscientific research "(1) those who readily accept (and sometimes over interpret) the results of neuroscientific studies; (2) those who completely reject the neuroscientific approach and consider the results of neuroscientific studies meaningless; (3) those who are unfamiliar with and indifferent toward, neuroscientific research; and (4) those who cautiously accept neuroscientific findings as being a proactive part of the total pattern of findings that have emerged from different corners of the cognitive and neural sciences". Greenwood (2009)&lt;sup&gt;[85]&lt;/sup&gt; suggests that as the body of knowledge available to educators increases, and the ability to be expert in all areas diminishes, the most productive standpoint would the fourth outlined by,&lt;sup&gt;[87]&lt;/sup&gt; that of cautious acceptance of neuroscientific findings and proactive collaboration.

Bennett &amp; Rolheiser-Bennett (2001)&lt;ref&gt;Bennett, B.B. and N.C. Rolheiser-Bennett, Beyond Monet: The artful science of instructional integration. 2001: Bookation.&lt;/ref&gt; point out that "teachers must be aware of and act on the science within the art of teaching". They suggest that educators must become aware of other methods and incorporate them into their practice. Furthermore, Bennett and Rolheiser-Bennett suggest that specific bodies of knowledge will play an important role in informing educators when making important decisions with regards to the "design of learning environments". The bodies of knowledge discussed include multiple intelligences, emotional intelligences, learning styles, the human brain, children at risk and gender. As the authors explain these and other areas are just "lenses designed to extend teachers’ understanding of how students learn, and from that understanding, to make decisions about how and when to select, integrate, and enact items in the … list".&lt;sup&gt;[88]&lt;/sup&gt;

Mason&lt;ref name = Mason2009 /&gt; supports calls for a two-way constructive collaboration between neuroscience and education, whereby, rather than neuroscience research simply being applied to education, findings from neuroscience research would be used to constrain educational theorizing. In return, education would influence the types of research questions and experimental paradigms used in neuroscience research. Mason also gives the example that while pedagogical practice in the classroom may give rise to educational questions regarding the emotional bases of performance on school tasks, neuroscience has the potential to reveal the brain basis of higher-order thinking processes and thus may help to understand the role that emotion plays in learning and open new areas of study of emotional thought in the classroom.

==Neuromyths==
The term "[[wikt:neuromyth|neuromyths]]" was first coined by an OECD report on understanding the brain.&lt;ref&gt;OECD, Understanding the Brain: Towards a New Learning Science, OECD, Editor. 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; The term refers to the translation of scientific findings into misinformation regarding education. The OECD report highlights three neuromyths for special attention, although several others have been identified by researchers such as Usha Goswami.

# The belief that hemispheric differences relate to different types of learning (i.e. left brain versus right brain).
# The belief that the brain is plastic for certain types of learning only during certain "critical periods", and therefore that learning in these areas must occur during these periods.
# The belief that effective educational interventions have to coincide with periods of synaptogenesis. Or in other words, children's environments should be enriched during the periods of maximal synaptic growth.

===Left versus right brain===
{{main|Lateralization of brain function}}
The idea that the two hemispheres of the brain may learn differently has virtually no grounding in neuroscience research.&lt;ref name = Goswami2006 /&gt; The idea has arisen from the knowledge that some cognitive skills appear differentially localised to a specific hemisphere (e.g., language functions are typically supported by left hemisphere brain regions in healthy right handed people). However, massive amount of fibre connections link the two hemispheres of the brain in neurologically healthy individuals. Every cognitive skill that has been investigated using neuroimaging to date employs a network of brain regions spread across both cerebral hemispheres, including language and reading, and thus no evidence exists for any type of learning that is specific to one side of the brain.

===Critical periods===
{{main|Critical period}} 
The critical periods neuromyth is an overextension of certain neuroscience research findings (see above) primarily from research into the visual system, rather than cognition and learning. Although sensory deprivation during certain time periods can clearly impede the development of visual skills, these periods are sensitive rather than critical, and the opportunity for learning is not necessarily lost forever, as the term "critical" implies. While children may benefit from certain types of environmental input, for example, being taught a second language during the sensitive period for language acquisition, this does not mean that adults are unable to acquire foreign language skills later in life.

The idea of critical periods comes primarily from the work of Hubel and Wiesel.&lt;ref&gt;Wiesel, T.N. and D.H. Hubel, Extent of recovery from the effects of visual deprivation in kittens. Journal of Neurophysiology, 1965. 28(6): p. 1060-1072.&lt;/ref&gt; Critical periods generally coincide with periods of excess synapse formation, and end at around the same time that synaptic levels stabilise. During these periods of synaptic formation, some brain regions are particularly sensitive to the presence or absence of certain general types of stimuli. There are different critical periods within specific systems, e.g. visual system has different critical periods for ocular dominance, visual acuity and binocular function&lt;ref&gt;Kuhl, P.K., Learning and representation in speech and language. Current Opinion in Neurobiology, 1994. 4(6): p. 812.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as different critical periods between systems, for example, the critical period for the visual system appears to end around the age of 12 years, while that for acquiring syntax ends around 16 years.

Rather than talking of a single critical period for general cognitive systems, neuroscientists now perceive sensitive periods of time during which the brain is most able to be shaped in a subtle and gradual fashion. Furthermore, critical periods themselves may be divided into three phases. The first, rapid change, followed by continued development with the potential for loss or deterioration, and finally a phase of continued development during which the system can recover from deprivation.

Although there is evidence for sensitive periods, we do not know whether they exist for culturally transmitted knowledge systems such as educational domains like reading and arithmetic. Further, we do not know what role synaptogenesis plays in the acquisition of these skills.

===Enriched environments===
The [[Environmental enrichment (neural)|enriched environment]] argument is based on evidence that rats raised in complex environments perform better on maze tasks and have 20-25% more synaptic connections than those raised in austere environments.&lt;ref name="Greenough, W.T. 1987. p. 539-559"&gt;Greenough, W.T., J.E. Black, and C.S. Wallace, Experience and brain development. Child development, 1987. 58(3): p. 539-559.&lt;/ref&gt; However, these enriched environments were in laboratory cages, and did not come close to replicating the intensely stimulating environment a rat would experience in the wild. Furthermore, the formation of these additional connections in response to novel environmental stimuli occurs throughout life, not just during a critical or sensitive period. For example, skilled pianists show enlarged representations in the auditory cortex relating specifically to piano tones,&lt;ref&gt;Pantev, C., et al., Increased auditory cortical representation in musicians. Nature, 1998. 392: p. 811-814.&lt;/ref&gt; while violinists have enlarged neural representations for their left fingers.&lt;ref&gt;Elbert, T., et al., Increased cortical representation of the fingers of the left hand in string players. Science, 1995. 270(5234): p. 305.&lt;/ref&gt; Even London taxi drivers who learn the London street map in intense detail develop enlarged formations in the part of the brain responsible for spatial representation and navigation.&lt;ref&gt;Maguire, E.A., et al., Navigation-related structural change in the hippocampi of taxi drivers. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 2000. 97(8): p. 4398-403.&lt;/ref&gt; These results show that the brain can form extensive new connections as the result of focused educational input, even when this input is received solely during adulthood. Greenough’s work suggests a second type of brain plasticity. Whereas synaptogenesis and critical periods relate to experience-expectant plasticity, synaptic growth in complex environments relates to "experience-dependent" plasticity. This type of plasticity is concerned with environment specific learning, and not to features of the environment that are ubiquitous and common to all members of the species, such as vocabulary.

Experience dependent plasticity is important because it does potentially link specific learning and brain plasticity, but it is relevant throughout the lifetime, not just in critical periods. "Experience-expectant plasticity",&lt;ref name="Greenough, W.T. 1987. p. 539-559"/&gt; suggests that the environmental features necessary for fine tuning [[sensory systems]] are ubiquitous and of a very general nature. These kinds of stimuli are abundant in any typical child's environment. Thus, experience-expectant plasticity does not depend on specific experiences within a specific environment, and therefore cannot provide much guidance in choosing toys, preschools, or early childcare policies. The link between experience and brain plasticity is intriguing. No doubt learning affects the brain, but this relationship does not offer guidance on how we should design instruction.

Bruer also warns of the dangers of enriching environments on the basis of socio-economic value systems, and warns of a tendency to value typically middle class pursuits as more enriching than those associated with a working class lifestyle, when there is no neuroscientific justification for this.

===Synaptogenesis===
{{main|Synaptogenesis}}
In addition some critics of the Educational Neuroscience approach have highlighted limitations in applying the understanding of early physiological brain development, in particular synaptogenesis to educational theory.

Synaptogenesis research has primarily been carried out on animals (e.g. monkeys and cats). Measures of synaptic density are aggregate measures, and it is known that different types of neuron within the same brain region differ in their synaptic growth rates [70]. Secondly, the purported "critical period" of birth to three years is derived from research on rhesus monkeys, who reach puberty at the age of three, and assumes that the period of synaptogenesis in humans exactly mirrors that of monkeys. It may be more reasonable to assume that this period of neural growth actually lasts until puberty, which would mean until early teenage years in humans.

Periods of intense synaptogenesis are typically correlated with the emergence of certain skills and cognitive functions, such as visual fixation, grasping, symbol use and working memory. However, these skills continue to develop well after the period that synaptogenesis is thought to end. Many of these skills continue to improve even after synaptic density reaches adult levels, and thus the most we can say is that synaptogenesis may be necessary for the emergence of these skills, but it cannot account entirely for their continued refinement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Goldman-Rakic | first1 = P.S. | year = 1987 | title = Development of cortical circuitry and cognitive function | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-8624.1987.tb01404.x | journal = Child Development | volume = 58| issue = | pages = 601–622 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some other form of brain change must contribute to ongoing learning.

Additionally, the types of cognitive changes usually seen to correlate with synaptogenesis revolve around visual, tactile, movement and working memory. These are not taught skills but rather skills that are usually acquired independent of schooling, even though they may support future learning. How these skills relate to later school learning is, however, unclear. We know that synaptogenesis occurs, and that the pattern of synaptogenesis is important for normal brain function. However, what is lacking is the ability of neuroscience to tell educators what sort of early childhood experiences might enhance children’s cognitive capacities or educational outcomes.

===Male versus female brain===
{{main|Neuroscience of sex differences}}
The idea that a person can have a "male" brain or "female" brain is a misinterpretation of terms used to describe cognitive styles by&lt;ref&gt;Baron-Cohen, S., The essential difference: Men, women and the extreme male brain. 2003: Allen Lane.&lt;/ref&gt; when attempting to conceptualise the nature of cognitive patterns in people with autism spectrum disorder. Baron-Cohen suggested that while men were better "systemisers" (good at understanding mechanical systems), women were better "empathisers" (good at communicating and understanding others), therefore he suggested that autism could be thought of as an extreme form of the "male brain". There was no suggestion that males and females had radically different brains or that females with autism had a male brain.

===Learning styles===
A common myth in the field of education is that individuals have different [[learning styles]], such as 'visual' or 'kinesthetic'. Many individuals will state preferences for the way in which they want to learn, but there is no evidence that matching a teaching technique to a preferred style will improve learning, despite this hypothesis being tested multiple times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Learning Styles: Concepts and Evidence|url=http://psi.sagepub.com/content/9/3/105.short|authors=Pashler, Harold; McDaniel, Mark; Rohrer, Doug; and Bjork, Robert|journal=Psychological Science in the Public Interest|year=2008|volume=9|number=3|pages=105–119|doi=10.1111/j.1539-6053.2009.01038.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Rohrer, Doug and Pashler, Harold|title=Learning styles: where’s the evidence?|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2923.2012.04273.x/abstract;jsessionid=8616753A83D4CC2618A48D549D89F8E9.f04t04?userIsAuthenticated=false&amp;deniedAccessCustomisedMessage=|journal=Medical Education|volume=46|issue=7|pages=634–635|year=2012|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2923.2012.04273.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; There may even be harms associated with the use of learning styles, wherein learners become 'pigeonholed', perceiving that they may not be suited to types of learning that are not matched to their 'learning style'&lt;ref name= Newton &gt;{{cite journal|title=The Learning Styles Myth is Thriving in Higher Education|author=Newton, Philip M.|journal=Frontiers in Psychology|url=http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fpsyg.2015.01908/full|year=2015|volume=6|page=1908|doi=10.3389/fpsyg.2015.01908|pmc=4678182|pmid=26696947}}&lt;/ref&gt; (e.g. so-called visual learners may not wish to learn music). Despite this lack of evidence, a 2012 study demonstrated that a belief in the use of learning styles is widespread amongst teachers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Neuromyths in education: Prevalence and predictors of misconceptions among teachers|author=Dekker, Sanne|url=http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fpsyg.2012.00429/full|journal=Frontiers in Psychology|year=2012|volume=3|page=429|doi=10.3389/fpsyg.2012.00429|displayauthors=etal|pmc=3475349|pmid=23087664}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a 2015 study showed that the majority of research papers in [[higher education]] research mistakenly endorse the use of learning styles.&lt;ref name=Newton/&gt;

The '''Even Start Program''' is a federally funded program in the United States that gives families access to training and support to create a literate home environment and enhance the academic achievement of their children. The program was first authorized in 1988, and administration was moved to individual states in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.ed.gov/programs/evenstartformula/index.html Even Start]&lt;/ref&gt; The program aims to:

*Help children to reach their full potential as learners (early childhood education)
*Provide literacy training for parents (adult education)
*Help parents to become full partners in education of their children (parenting education)

In May 2009, President [[Barack Obama]] proposed eliminating the program.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/05/06/AR2009050603454.html Lori Montgomery and Amy Goldstein, "Obama's Budget Knife Yields Modest Trims", Washington Post, May 7, 2009.]&lt;/ref&gt; As of June 2010, the program is still funded.

==Early childhood education==
The components of early childhood are for children that are at least 6 weeks to 3 years of age. The children learn different things according to their age, while parents are attending adult education classes.

==Adult education==
Adults can complete their high school education, work towards their GED, participate in Adult Basic Education classes, and participate in English as a Second Language.

==Parenting education==
The Even Start Parenting Education Program helps to educate and inform parents on topics that relate to being a parent. The Parenting Education Class is a requirement of the Even Start program. Parents receive credit for attending these sessions. Lunch is usually provided on the days the parenting classes are scheduled.

==Parents and Children Together (PACT)==
The child and parent interaction takes place in the infant, younger toddler, and older toddler classrooms. It gives the child and the parent a chance to spend quality time together. Learning is what both the parents and the children do at this time to become true partners in their education. Activities are provided for the child and the parent on these daily occasions.

==Home visits==
The Home Visitor Program is provided to support families in transferring learning from the classroom to their daily lives. The home visits provide literacy-based activities in the home. The visitor brings a book and/or an activity and discusses with the parents the importance of literacy in the home. These visits are once a month and the day and parent, child and the home visitor mutually agree upon time. This is also an Even Start requirement.

'''''Excellence Without A Soul: How a Great University Forgot Education''''' (reissued as ''Excellence Without a Soul: Does Liberal Education Have a Future?'') is a 2006 book by [[Harry R. Lewis]] (Gordon McKay Professor of Computer Science at [[Harvard University]]'s School of Engineering and Applied Sciences) examining the state of American higher education, with particular reference to Harvard. It attracted considerable attention for its trenchant analysis of [[undergraduate education]], much of it based on his experience as dean of [[Harvard College]] (1995{{ndash}}2003).

It has been translated into [[Standard Chinese|Chinese]] and [[Korean language|Korean]].

'''The Finnish Education Evaluation Centre (FINEEC)''' is an independent government agency that evaluates education in Finland and the work of Finnish education providers from early childhood education to higher education, and produces information for education policy decision-making and the development of education. FINEEC carries out audits of quality systems, evaluations of learning outcomes (in basic education and [[Secondary school|upper secondary education]]), as well as thematic and system evaluations. FINEEC also supports education providers and higher education institutions in matters pertaining to evaluation and quality management, as well as works to develop the evaluation of education.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://karvi.fi/en/fineec/|title=FINEEC - FINEEC|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.uta.fi/laatujarjestelma/en/in_Finland.html|title=University of Tampere - The Quality Assurance of Finnish Higher Education|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tasks and organisation of FINEEC are specified in [[legislation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://karvi.fi/app/uploads/2016/05/3-Act-on-FINEEC.pdf|title=FINEEC - Act on the Finnish Education Evaluation Centre|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
FINEEC began operating in May 2014 when the evaluation activities of the Finnish Higher Education Evaluation Council, the Finnish Education Evaluation Council and the Finnish National Board of Education were combined.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

It has been proposed that the Matriculation Examination Board and FINEEC should be incorporated into the new Finnish National Agency for Education in 2018. The two would nevertheless continue to operate as independent bodies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://yle.fi/uutiset/3-8355900|title=Yle - Opetushallitus ja CIMO yhdistyvät uudeksi virastoksi (In Finnish)|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Juhannus-helsinki-2007-034.jpg|thumb|The main office of FINEEC is located in Postitalo in Helsinki.]]

== Organisation ==
FINEEC comprises the Evaluation Council, the Higher Education Evaluation Committee and three competence units: the [[Secondary education|General Education]] and [[Early Childhood Education]] Unit, the [[Vocational Education]] Unit, and the [[Higher Education]] and Liberal [[Adult Education]] Unit. FINEEC has a staff of about 50, with offices in [[Helsinki]] and [[Jyväskylä]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://karvi.fi/en/contact/|title=FINEEC - Contact|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* '''The Evaluation Council''' monitors and develops FINEEC’s work and prepares the strategic guidelines for the agency. The Finnish government appoints the members of the Evaluation Council for four years at a time. The Evaluation Council submits a proposal for an evaluation plan to the Ministry of Education and Culture.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* '''The Higher Education Evaluation Committee''' decides on the project plans for evaluations of higher education institutions, planning and evaluation teams, as well as on the outcomes of the quality system audits. FINEEC may also appoint committees and other divisions.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Evaluations ==
FINEEC implements system and thematic evaluations, learning outcome evaluations and field-specific evaluations.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Examples of evaluations carried out by FINEEC at different educational levels:
* '''Basic education''' 
** The evaluation of learning outcomes in mother tongue and literature showed that in the ninth grade, girls produce better summer job applications than boys.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.karjalainen.fi/uutiset/uutis-alueet/kotimaa/item/74548-9-luokkalaiset-pojat-tekivat-heikkoja-kesatyohakemuksia-tytot-vahvoilla|title=Karjalainen - 9-luokkalaiset pojat tekivät heikkoja kesätyöhakemuksia - tytöt vahvoilla (In Finnish)|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** Of the pupils in the ninth grade studying Finnish as second language, a total of 87 per cent achieved a good competence level, whereas 13 per cent of the pupils only mastered the basics of Finnish.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hs.fi/kotimaa/art-2000002894756.html|title=Helsingin Sanomat - Selvitys: Suomi luistaa ysiluokkalaisilta toisena kielenä – kaikilla kielitaito ei riitä kuitenkaan lukioon (In Finnish)|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://karvi.fi/en/2016/04/05/finnish-as-a-second-language-syllabus-learning-outcomes-in-the-9th-grade-of-basic-education-in-2015/|title=FINEEC - Finnish as a second language syllabus learning outcomes in the 9th grade of basic education in 2015|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
** There are differences in the evaluations of mathematics competence of ninth-grade pupils: In some schools, pupils faring equally well in the evaluations received different grades, and the gaps could be as much as two whole grades.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hs.fi/kotimaa/art-2000002898045.html|title=Helsingin Sanomat - Ysiluokkalaisten matematiikan osaaminen ei enää heikentynyt – moni ei silti osaa laskea, mitä maksaa 30 prosentin alennuksessa oleva paita (In Finnish)|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://yle.fi/uutiset/osasto/news/study_two-thirds_of_ninth_graders_unable_to_calculate_percentages/8835412|title=Yle - Study: Two-thirds of ninth graders unable to calculate percentages|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** Girls fare significantly better than boys in home economics, in both knowledge and skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hs.fi/kotimaa/art-2000002811165.html|title=Helsingin Sanomat - Tyttöjen ja poikien erot kotitaloustaidoissa ovat suuret (In Finnish)|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* '''General upper secondary education''' 
** There are major differences between general upper secondary schools in the way in which mathematics skills are graded: In a school with high requirement levels, a student receiving a grade of 5 may possess the same skills as a student receiving a grade of 9 in another school.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ksml.fi/kotimaa/Lukion-matematiikan-arvosanoista-paljastui-hurjaa-heittely%C3%A4-Arvosana-5-voi-olla-toisessa-lukiossa-9/947753|title=Keskisuomalainen - Lukion matematiikan arvosanoista paljastui hurjaa heittelyä: Arvosana 5 voi olla toisessa lukiossa 9 (In Finnish)|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Vocational education''' 
** Individuals possessing the Vocational Qualification in Business Information Technology are doing extremely well in information and communication technology competence tests. However, their job prospects are not as good as before because more specialised skills are now required.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ts.fi/uutiset/kotimaa/3013486/Datanomit+osaavat+mutta+tyollisyystilanne+on+heikentynyt|title=Turun Sanomat - Datanomit osaavat, mutta työllisyystilanne on heikentynyt (In Finnish)|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://karvi.fi/en/2016/12/05/new-publication-announcement-vocational-competence-in-the-vocational-qualification-in-information-and-communications-technology/|title=FINEEC - Vocational competence in the Vocational Qualification in Information and Communications Technology|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
** Finland produces highly competent textile industry professionals, but the employment situation in the sector is weak.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.karjalainen.fi/uutiset/uutis-alueet/kotimaa/item/122442-suomessa-valmistuu-osaavia-ompelijoita-vain-tyopaikat-puuttuvat|title=Karjalainen - Suomessa valmistuu osaavia ompelijoita - vain työpaikat puuttuvat (In Finnish)|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** Most of the providers of vocational education have a properly functioning quality management system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ts.fi/uutiset/kotimaa/826268/Selvitys+Ammatillisen+koulutuksen+laadunhallinta+toimii|title=Turun Sanomat - Selvitys: Ammatillisen koulutuksen laadunhallinta toimii (In Finnish)|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
FINEEC is responsible for the evaluation of education provided by universities and universities of applied sciences in Finland. The three key evaluation types are the audits of higher education institutions' quality systems, thematic evaluations of the education system and accreditations of engineering degree programmes. Higher education institutions passing the audits carried out by FINEEC receive a quality label, which shows that the quality system used in the organisation in question is in accordance with European principles and recommendations, and that it also meets the national criteria for quality management in higher education institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://karvi.fi/en/higher-education/|title=FINEEC - Higher education|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The quality label is valid for six years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://karvi.fi/en/higher-education/audits-quality-systems/audit-register/|title=FINEEC - Audit register|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The National Educational Goals known as Goals 2000 were set by the U.S. Congress in the 1990s to set goals for [[standards-based education reform]]. The intent was for certain criteria to be met by the millennium (2000). Many of these goals were based on the principles of [[outcomes-based education]], and not all of the goals were attained by the year 2000 as intended. Many see this as the predecessor to the [[No Child Left Behind]] program, which mandated measurable improvement in student achievement across all groups. '''Goals 2000''' established a framework in which to identify world-class academic standards, to measure student progress, and to provide the support that students may need to help meet the standards.

==Goals&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?path=&amp;req=granuleid%3AUSC-prelim-title20-section5812&amp;f=&amp;fq=&amp;num=0&amp;hl=false&amp;edition=prelim|title=20 USC 5812: National Education Goals|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;==

The goals stated in the Summary of Goals 2000 include:

;By the Year 2000...

==History==

"The Goals 2000: Educate America Act (P.L. 103-227)" was signed into law on March 31, 1994 by President [[Bill Clinton]]. The Act provides resources to states and communities to ensure that all students reach their full potential.

It is based on the premise of [[outcomes-based education]] that students will reach higher levels of achievement when more is expected of them. Congress appropriated $105 million for fiscal year 1994. States submitted applications to develop school improvement plans, and make subgrants to local schools, and awards for pre-service and professional development.

In 1996, President Clinton introduced a competitive grant entitled the Technology Literacy Challenge Fund (TLCF). The president allocated 2 million dollars to ensure that every child in every school utilize technology to achieve high standards by the dawn of the 21st century. The president urged a variety of stakeholders from the private sector, schools, teachers, students, community groups, state and local governors and the federal government to work in a partnership toward achieving high levels of technology in schools.

In a 1996 letter to school Chief Operating Officers, President Clinton urged states and local school districts to work together in achieving the following four goals:
# All teachers will have the training and support they need to help all students learn through computers the [[information superhighway]]
# All teachers and students will have modern computers in their classrooms
# Every classroom will be connected to the information superhighway
# Effective and engaging software and on-line resources will be an integral part of every school curriculum

The overarching problem behind ensuring that every child in every school utilize an equal level of technology is the TLCF was a competitive grant. The issue with the competitive grant notion is that not all schools and therefore children could receive equal levels of technological assistance.

==National Standards for Arts Education==

With the passage of Goals 2000, the first National Standards for Arts Education were created. There are content standards for dance, theater, music, and the visual arts. Every content standard is followed by several achievement standards describing how students are to demonstrate mastery of the content standards. The goals are not intended to be a curriculum. Instead, curriculum is to be developed locally on the basis of the goals. Standards are grouped in four divisions—creation and performance; cultural and historical context; perception and analysis; and the nature and value of the arts.

The Music Content Standards for each level are as follows:

# Singing, alone and with others, a varied repertoire of music
# Playing instruments, alone and with others, a varied repertoire of music
# Improvising melodies, variations, and accompaniments
# Composing and arranging music within specified guidelines
# Reading and notating music
# Listening to, analyzing, and describing music
# Evaluating music and music performance
# Understanding relationships between music, the other arts, and disciplines outside the arts
# Understanding music in relation to history and culture

== End of Goals 2000 ==

With the final language of President George Bush's 2001 [[No Child Left Behind Act]] (H.R. 1) came the withdrawal of all authorization for Goals 2000. However, even though Congress had withdrawn its authorization for Goals 2000, if funding was not also withdrawn, the crippled, but alive Goals 2000 program would stagger on. Then, just before leaving town on December 21, 2001, Congress passed the Fiscal Year 2002 Education Appropriations Conference Committee report which eliminated spending on Goals 2000. Goals 2000 was no longer authorized or funded.

Additionally, in an article by Kenneth J. Cooper from ''[[The Washington Post]]'' dated December 3, 1999, he stated the following:

:"The nation has not met any of the eight educational goals for the year 2000 set a decade ago by President Bush and the governors of all 50 states, although measurable progress has been made toward the goals pertaining to preschoolers and student achievement in math and reading, a national panel announced yesterday.

:The National Education Goals Panel’s final report before the 2000 deadline showed that more children were 'ready to learn'—healthier and better prepared through preschool or parental reading—when they entered kindergarten. Students also demonstrated higher math proficiency, particularly in elementary and middle school, and a slight improvement in reading proficiency in middle school."&lt;ref&gt;“’89 Education Summit's Goals Still Unmet.” ''The Washington Post''. (December 3, 1999, Friday, Final Edition).&lt;/ref&gt;

In the case of two goals, teacher quality and school safety, the panel reported the nation has actually gone backward. The percentage of teachers holding a college degree in the main subject they teach dropped from 66 percent to 63 percent, and there was a significant increase in student use of illicit drugs, from 24 percent to 37 percent in 10th grade.

The '''Hayward teachers strike''' was an April 2007 ten-day [[Strike action|strike]] of teachers in the [[Hayward Unified School District]] in [[Hayward, California]]. 

==Teacher demands==
The teachers, counselors and nurses, represented by the Hayward Education Association (HEA), were upset over a 16% raise given to two district administrators in summer 2006. Negotiations broke down, with the HEA asking for an 8.08% retroactive raise initially, reaching 16% after 2 years, and the district offering a one time 5.5% raise (one source stating 7%) with possible subsequent increases of 1.6%, which was rejected. The district offered an additional one time 3% bonus, which was also rejected. The district had come out of receivership in 2005, and the administration was concerned about the district going back into the red. Teachers cited the administrator's raises as evidence the district undervalued teachers and might be hiding money that could be applied to teacher salaries.

==Strike==
The strike commenced on 5 April 2007, with only 45 of approximately 900 teachers showing up to work, with the balance appearing in picket lines.&lt;ref&gt;Nanette Asimov, "[http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2007/04/06/BAG5QP448Q1.DTL Hayward Teachers' strike jolts schools on its first day]", ''San Francisco Chronicle'', 6 April 2007 (accessed 15 September 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; District administrator Dale Vigil initially dismissed the strike effects, but after a week of the strike, Vigil looked to file an injunction against the HEA, to force the teachers back into classrooms. Vigil was confronted at one point by angry strikers, who pounded on his car and pushed him.

==Impact on schools==
Only 4,100 of approximately 22,000 district students showed up for classes the first day of the strike. 29 schools were affected initially.

==Community and media response==
[[United Farm Workers|Farm Workers Union]] founder and activist [[Dolores Huerta]] showed up to support the striking teachers. Local TV and newspaper outlets covered the story.

==Conclusion==
The Hayward Teachers strike ended in a tentative agreement on 25 April 2007, when Vigil announced the settlement during a regular school board meeting. Teachers voted to pass the agreement detailing an 11% raise over the next two years, the following day, as classes resumed.

'''Home education'''  in the UK is often termed "elective home education" (EHE) to signify the independent nature of practice from state provisions such as education for children with ill-health provided by the local authority in the family home.  EHE is a collective term used in the UK to describe education provided other than through the schooling system.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/Parents/Schoolslearninganddevelopment/ChoosingASchool/DG_4016124 Educating your child at home] [[Directgov]]&lt;/ref&gt; Parents have a duty to ensure their children are educated but the [[Education Act#United Kingdom and predecessor states|education legislation]] in England and Wales does not differentiate between school attendance or education otherwise than at school.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opsi.gov.uk/ACTS/acts1996/ukpga_19960056_en_2#pt1-ch1-pb3-l1g7 Education Act (1996): Section 7] (covering England and Wales. Similar wording is included in legislation for Northern Ireland)&lt;/ref&gt; Scots education legislation on the other hand differentiates between public (state) school provision and education “by other means”, which includes both private schooling and home education.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opsi.gov.uk/RevisedStatutes/Acts/ukpga/1980/cukpga_19800044_en_6#pt2-pb3-l1g49 Education (Scotland) Act (1980): Section 30]&lt;/ref&gt; The numbers of families retaining direct responsibility for the education of their children has steadily increased since the late 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Rothermel |first1=Paula |title=International perspectives on home education : do we still need schools? |isbn=978-1137446848}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Myers |first1=Martin |title=Record numbers of children are now homeschooled, but who's keeping an eye on the parents? |url=https://theconversation.com/record-numbers-of-children-are-now-homeschooled-but-whos-keeping-an-eye-on-the-parents-88449 |website=The Conversation |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; This increase has coincided with the formation of support groups such as [[Education Otherwise]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/education/2002/aug/27/schools.uk2 Opting out] [[The Guardian]], 27 August 2002&lt;/ref&gt;  Home education may involve an informal style of education described as [[unschooling]], [[informal learning]], natural or [[Homeschooling#Autonomous_learning|autonomous learning]].&lt;ref&gt;Educating your child at home, Alan Thomas, Harriet Pattison, Continuum,  {{ISBN|0-8264-7999-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Others prefer to retain a structured school at home approach sometimes referred to as [[homeschooling]]  (a term more popular in the US) although the terms are often interchanged.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/education/2009/jun/11/home-education-parents-face-tighter-regulation Government moves to tighten regulation of home education ] [[The Guardian]] Thursday 11 June 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==England and Wales==

===History===
With the [[Elementary Education Act 1870]] came attempts to formalise and regulate what had been an ad-hoc schooling system.&lt;ref&gt;The evolution of the nursery-infant school: a history of infant and nursery education in Britain, 1800-1970, Nanette Whitbread, Routledge, {{ISBN|0-7100-7291-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Campaigners to establish a school system such as the [[National Education League]] had argued that schools were for children "not otherwise receiving education" and the 1870 act specified "a reasonable excuse for non-attendance at school : 1. That the child is under efficient instruction in some other manner".&lt;ref&gt;Elementary Education Act, 1870, Introduction XXVI&lt;/ref&gt;

In England and Wales, the law states that all children between the ages of 5 and 16 must receive a full-time suitable education as per their age, ability and aptitude and any special needs they may have must be met, either by regular attendance at school or otherwise&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opsi.gov.uk/ACTS/acts1996/ukpga_19960056_en_2#pt1-ch1-pb3-l1g7 Education Act (1996): Section 7]&lt;/ref&gt;.

With the growth of the schooling system came fresh theories and philosophies of education such as those of [[Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi]] who would influence the likes of [[Herbert Spencer]] who in his essays on education (1854 and 1859) argued against the traditional authoritative classical form of education that disregarded the natural wishes, tendencies, and motives of the child&lt;ref&gt;Essays on Education and Kindred Subjects, Introduction by Charles W. Eliot, Dent, 1911&lt;/ref&gt; In turn there were many further pioneers such as [[Charlotte Mason]], [[Caroline Southwood Hill]] and [[Susan Sutherland Isaacs]].

The twentieth century saw the opening of schools such as [[Summerhill School|Summerhill]] and [[Dartington Hall#Dartington Hall School|Dartington]] and the establishment of [[The Peckham Experiment]]. The government had set up consultative committees chaired by [[William Henry Hadow]]. The Hadow reports (1923–1933) with their suggestions such that "a good school 'is not a place of compulsory instruction, but a community of old and young, engaged in learning by cooperative experiment'.&lt;ref&gt;Gillard, D. 'The Hadow Reports: an introduction', the encyclopaedia of informal education, http://www.infed.org/schooling/hadow_reports.htm&lt;/ref&gt; laid the foundations for the [[Education Act 1944|1944 Education act]] which required that each child be educated according to their individual aptitude and ability either at school or otherwise. The plans for a liberal communal based education system incorporating schools, village halls and community centres&lt;ref&gt;The Times, Friday, 22 December 1944; pg. 5; Issue 50023; col C&lt;/ref&gt; floundered against local bureaucracy and finance and offered little more than a [[Tripartite System|tripartite school system]] which itself would be abandoned as ineffectual in favour of [[comprehensive school]]s later to be dismissed as "bog standard"&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/1175791.stm Blunkett rejects 'bog standard' tag] [[BBC News]] 18 February 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

During the early 1950s Joy Baker became one of the first parents to abandon the school based education system in favour of the otherwise path. She would spend ten years battling with the authorities who insisted her children should attend school.&lt;ref&gt;Joy Baker: Trailblazer for Home-based Education and Personalised Learning, Chris Shute, {{ISBN|1-900219-35-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the early 1970s Dartington school ran a scheme, known as The Terrace, with Yorkshire County Council overseen by [[Alec Clegg]] to provide education to pupils who were required to stay on at school due to the raising of the leaving age. The scheme was run by [[Dick Kitto]] who had been working at Dartington. Kitto set up an informal democratic system and was impressed by how well the pupils responded to such opportunities.&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Duane (head teacher)|Duane, Michael]] (1995). The Terrace: An Educational Experiment in a State School. London: Freedom Press. {{ISBN|0-900384-78-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kitto planned to expand his ideas to cover more schools but he discovered that some parents had already moved beyond his ideas and had decided to abandon schooling for their children altogether. A meeting for these families was organised in the late 70's/early eighties (check date) which would lead to the establishment of Education Otherwise. The meeting included Iris and Geoff Harrison whose fight with the authorities to home educate their five dyslexic children was widely publicised in the media at that time. Education Otherwise is now a charity and organisation that helps families and children with queries relating to home education and resource-related issues. Other organisations such as AHED also exist.

====Badman Review====
{{main|Badman Review}}
In 2009, [[Ed Balls]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090611/wmstext/90611m0001.htm Elective Home Education] [[Hansard]] 11 June 2009 : Column 44WS&lt;/ref&gt; the Secretary of State for [[DCSF|Children, Schools and Families]], commissioned Graham Badman, the former Director of Children's Services at [[Kent County Council]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/education/2009/jun/11/home-education-parents-register Parents who home educate children to be forced to register] [[The Guardian]], 11 June 2009&lt;/ref&gt; to review current practice of local authorities in relation to home educators, and to investigate if home education was used as a cover for some forms of child abuse.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dcsf.gov.uk/pns/DisplayPN.cgi?pn_id=2009_0013 Action To Ensure Children’s Education &amp; Welfare] DCSF Press Release, January 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

When published in June 2009, the response was mixed. Balls himself accepted much of the review's recommendations in relation to [[safeguarding]], however many home educators were extremely angry at the recommendation to force all to register.&lt;ref name="bbc-he-resp"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/8095864.stm Home educators made to register]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Children, Schools and Families Select Committee]] announced its own inquiry into the handling of the Badman Review.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parliament.uk/parliamentary_committees/csf/csfpn220709.cfm Children, Schools and Families Committee Press Notice] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100126144058/http://www.parliament.uk/parliamentary_committees/csf/csfpn220709.cfm |date=26 January 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It criticised both the Department and the Badman Review and made a number of recommendations against the thrust of the original report.

Although the Department framed legislation to implement much of the review,&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/8365163.stm  Queen's Speech: Bill-by-bill] [[BBC News]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmbills/008/10008.38-44.html#m01s  Children, Schools and Families Bill] Schedule 1 - Home education, England (draft legislation)&lt;/ref&gt; due to a lack of cross-party support and intense campaigning by home education advocacy groups it was  dropped by the Labour administration in the run-up to the 2010 General Election.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01425692.2017.1406337|title=Muslims, home education and risk in British society|last=Myers|first=Martin|date=19 April 2018|website=10.1080/01425692.2017.1406337|archive-url=|archivedate=|dead-url=|accessdate=19 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/8607677.stm Ed Balls drops key education reforms] [[BBC News]] 7 April 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Roles and responsibilities of parents and local authorities==
The government recognises that education is a fundamental right for every child and that parents have the right to choose to educate their child at home rather than at school.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/288135/guidelines_for_las_on_elective_home_educationsecondrevisev2_0.pdf Elective home education: guidelines for local authorities 13 August 2013]&lt;/ref&gt; The roles and responsibilities of parents and local authorities in this regard are covered by a document called Elective Home Education: Guidelines For Local Authorities and is published by the Department for Education.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/elective-home-education Department for Education&lt;/ref&gt; These guidelines have statutory standing and following these guidelines is obligatory on local authorities.

The guidelines quote section 7 of The Education Act 1996:

"The parent of every child of compulsory school age shall cause him to receive efficient full-time education suitable
(a) to his age, ability and aptitude, and
(b) to any special educational needs he may have,  
either by regular attendance at school or otherwise."

The mention of "otherwise" is what covers education outside of school, including home education. The guidelines go on to explain that an efficient education is one that achieves what it sets out to achieve.  It needs to prepare the child for adult life in the community of which the child is a member. Emphasis is placed (section 2.3) on the fact that the education does not need to prepare the child for life in the country as a whole but for life in the community of which the child is a member.

There is no definition of what constitutes a full-time education, but the guidelines accept that education at home may not follow the rigid hours of the school structure and it is difficult to impossible to measure exact hours devoted to it.

Home educating parents are not required to teach the National Curriculum; provide a broad and balanced education; have a timetable; have premises equipped to any particular standard; set hours during which education will take place; have any specific qualifications; make detailed plans in advance; observe school hours, days or terms; give formal lessons; mark work done by their child; formally assess progress or set development objectives; reproduce school type peer group socialisation or match school-based, age-specific standards (section 3.13).

Local authorities have no duty to monitor the quality of home education (section 2.7), have no right to enter the homes of home educators or otherwise see children for the purpose of monitoring their education (section 2.14 - 2.16) and are required to leave home educators to just get on with the job (various sections) unless the LA already has information that the parents are not delivering a suitable education (section 3.4).

Except where the child is registered at a school for children with [[special needs]] no permission is required from the school or local authority to deregister the child (section 2.4). Parents can deregister a child from the school system by the simple means of notifying the school in writing (section 3.8). There is no action, notification or deregistration process for those children who have never been to school. When a child reaches the age of five parents can choose to register the child at a school or continue to educate the child at home as they have been doing since the child's birth.

==Regulation and monitoring==
The law on education otherwise i.e. outside of school, taken together with the "Elective Home Education: Guidelines For Local Authorities" gives local authorities no responsibility, rights or control over home educators. Local authorities cannot require home educators to register, cannot demand regular inspection of the provision or access to the children and cannot seek to control or approve the education provided by parents at home. The only exceptions to some of the above are certain cases of children with [[special needs]] where the local authority is charged with providing support.

While local authorities have very little authority over home educators they do have a responsibility to identify children in their locality who are not receiving an education. Many local authorities find this a frustrating conflict and have often complained about their lack of power over home educators. They have done so in their feedback&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.education.gov.uk/consultations/downloadableDocs/PDF%20FINAL%20HOME%20ED.pdf]|Graham Badman Report&lt;/ref&gt; to the [[Badman Review|Graham Badman]] review of home education, in their submissions to the All Party Parliamentary Group for Home Education and in other surveys and inquiries. Many claim that unless they can require all home educators to register, and regularly inspect the provision of every home educator, they are unable to effectively deliver on the identification of children not receiving an adequate education. Local authorities sometimes attempt to circumvent the law and force compulsory registration on to home educators and/or otherwise deprive home educators of their legal rights under the pretext of identifying children missing education, according to the Education Select Committee's Fifth Report to Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;[https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmselect/cmeduc/559/559.pdf]|Education Committee's fifth report to Parliament&lt;/ref&gt; On numerous occasions, as with Kent County Council, [https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-kent-28265850] home educators have had to fight back to avoid local authority interference.

Home educators respond to local authority frustrations on identifying children missing an education by pointing to the fact that the law and guidelines give local authorities the option to intervene only when it has already come to the attention of the local authority that a child is not receiving an adequate education, that it was not the intention of the legislators to give local authorities the power to go on "fishing trips" that would impose on all home educators, that any regime of regular inspection of home educators would be hugely expensive while delivering very little value and that local authorities would achieve far more using their resources to improve schools that are not delivering an adequate education. Further, as local authority funding is related to the number of children in school local authorities have a [[perverse incentive]] to force home educated children into schools. That local authorities often act outside the law when dealing with home educators and given that the "large majority" of local authorities (all except 30) provide misleading information on their websites in relation to home education (page 23 of The Education Committee's report to Parliament), home educators remain wary of and opposed to any additional powers being awarded to local authorities who many see as anti-home education.

==Qualifications, higher education, college==
Just as school is not compulsory, exams and qualifications are not compulsory either. Home educated children often go directly into higher education or vocational courses without first passing through [[Gcse|GCSEs]] and [[A levels]]. However, many institutions require proof of secondary level or pre-university level qualifications before admitting a student or providing employment. To meet those requirements home educated children take GCSE or [[iGCSE]] exams privately. This option is also available for A levels. While some GCSE subjects require "controlled assessment" at a school, others don't. There is no controlled assessment for iGCSE or A level qualifications.

==Organisations and events==

Across the UK, including in Scotland and Northern Ireland, local groups of home educating parents run regular meets, events, trips, picnics and camps. At the national level there are organisations and charities such as [[Education Otherwise]] and the [[Schoolhouse Home Education Association]] advising on matters related to home education.

There are other meets such as the annual [[HESFES|HESFES event]] and Wild! Gathering where home educators gather for a combination of education, co-operation and entertainment.

===Scotland===

The situation in Scotland is slightly different in that if a child is already in school the parent needs to get permission from the local authority to deregister the child, which permission should be granted fairly quickly.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.schoolhouse.org.uk/home-education-and-the-law/how-your-local-authority-should-respond-to-your-request]|Getting Permission From the Local Authority in Scotland&lt;/ref&gt; No such permission is needed if the child has never attended school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.educationscotland.gov.uk/parentzone/yourchildatschool/choosingaschool/homeeducation/index.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=24 August 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141001153601/http://www.educationscotland.gov.uk/parentzone/yourchildatschool/choosingaschool/homeeducation/index.asp |archivedate=1 October 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Home education in Scotland is governed by the Scottish Government's Statutory Guidance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2007/12/17133313/0]| Scotland Statutory Guidance on Home Education&lt;/ref&gt;

===Northern Ireland===

Elective Home Education is legal in Northern Ireland under Section 45 of the Education and Libraries Northern Ireland Order 1986 SI 1986/594 which models English legislation in requiring the education of children of school age "by regular attendance at school or otherwise." There are approximately 500-1000 home educated children in Northern Ireland, but exact numbers are difficult to determine due to the lack of registration. Currently there is no legal requirement for parents to register their children with the Education Board, but a consultation by the Department of Education that started in April 2014 has proposed mandatory registration, home visits, inspection of premises &amp; approval of curriculum. This draft policy by the Department of Education has alarmed home educators by requiring what the law does not, therefore creating the potential for confusion. The consultation is due to end on 27 June 2014. The largest Home Education group in Northern Ireland, HEDNI is actively involved in opposing this change in policy.

'''''I'm a Teacher, Get Me Out of Here''''' is a novel by [[Francis Gilbert]]. It was first published in hardback, in 2003 by Short Books.

A parody of the TV show ''[[I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here! (UK TV series)|I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!]]'', it is set around a teacher's trials and tribulations, in an [[inner city]] school, from training to teaching. Gilbert bases this book on his own teaching experiences, much of the content being close to fact with only names and locations changed.

Well received by critics, the novel was released in paperback in 2005 ({{ISBN|978-1904095682}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/reviews/im-a-teacher-get-me-out-of-here-by-francis-gilbert-558543.html |title=I'm A Teacher, Get Me Out Of Here, by Francis Gilbert|location=London |work=The Independent|author=Bill Greenwell|date=2 April 2004 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091127190940/http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/reviews/im-a-teacher-get-me-out-of-here-by-francis-gilbert-558543.html |archivedate=2009-11-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Francis Gilbert |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2004/feb/29/biography.schools |title=I've learnt my lesson |publisher=Guardian |date=29 February 2004 |accessdate={{date| 9 dec 2014}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epolitix.com/mpwebsites/mparticles/mparticledetails/newsarticle/a-class-act-im-a-teacher-get-me-out-of-here-francis-gilbert-short-books///mpsite/clare-short/?no_cache=1 ] {{dead link|date=July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Mo Serruya |url=http://www.thisisull.com/reviews/books/cathyteacher.html |title=Hull Local Book Reviews - I'm a Teacher Get Me Out of Here by Francis Gilbert (Short Books) Reviewed By Cathy Walker |publisher=Thisisull.com |date={{date|07 jun 2005 }}|accessdate={{date| 9 dec 2014}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=John Mannion |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2004/apr/10/featuresreviews.guardianreview1 |title=Review: I'm a Teacher, Get Me Out of Here! by Francis Gilbert &amp;#124; Books |publisher=The Guardian |date=2013-10-06 |accessdate=2013-10-12 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Blum |first=Hester |url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-21045311_ITM |title=Article: The hard school of education.(I'm A Teacher, Get Me Out Of Here)(Book... &amp;#124; AccessMyLibrary - Promoting library advocacy |publisher=AccessMyLibrary |date= |accessdate=2013-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''International Journal of Play''''' ('''''IJP''''') is a tri-annual [[peer-reviewed]] [[academic journal]] published by [[Taylor &amp; Francis]].  ''IJP'' is co-edited by Michael Patte ([[Bloomsburg University of Pennsylvania]]), Fraser Brown ([[Leeds Beckett University]]), Anna Beresin ([[University of the Arts (Philadelphia)|The University of the Arts]]), and Dr Sylwyn Guilbaud (book review editor).

==History==
The ''International Journal of Play'' is the official journal of [[The Association for the Study of Play]].  The Journal emerged from conversations between a Professor of Playful Learning, Pat Broadhead (Leeds Metropolitan University), and Katie Peace at Taylor and Francis at an early-years education conference in the UK.  Elizabeth Wood and David Whitebread joined the discussions along with Michael Patte (formerly president of [[The Association for the Study of Play]]), who was visiting Leeds on a Fulbright scholarship at the time.  June Factor (University of Melbourne) joined shortly afterwards.  The Association for the Study of Play (TASP) adopted the journal, supporting it through membership subscriptions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Broadhead|first1= Pat|date=2014 |title= Editorial |url= http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/21594937.2014.908527|journal= International Journal of Play|volume= 3|issue= 1|pages= 1-3|doi= 10.1080/21594937.2014.908527|access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The first issue of the ''International Journal of Play'' was released in March of 2012.&lt;ref name =broadhead2012&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Broadhead|first1= Pat|last2= Factor|first2= June|last3= Patte |first3= Michael|date=2012 |title= Editorial|url= http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/21594937.2012.659858?redirect=1 |journal=International Journal of Play |volume= 1|issue=1 |pages= |doi=10.1080/21594937.2012.659858 |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''International Journal of Play'' publishes research reports, theoretical reviews and position papers, policy critiques, essays, memoir, and book reviews.  It has a section titled ''The State of Play'', where [[Playwork|playworkers]], other practitioners, and scholars reflect on current perspectives and future possibilities, and ''Books Worth (Re)Reading'', which explores classic and overlooked books about play.&lt;ref name =broadhead2012/&gt;

==Abstracting and indexing==
The journal is abstracted and indexed in the Australian Education Index (AEI) by the [[Australian Council for Educational Research]].&lt;ref name=&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tandfonline.com/action/journalInformation?journalCode=rijp20 |title= Journal Information |publisher= Taylor &amp; Francis|work= |accessdate= November 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The STS '''''Kaisei''''' (海星), meaning ''“Sea Star”'' in the [[Japanese language]], is a [[steel]]-hulled [[brigantine]] designed by designed by [[Poland|Polish]] [[Naval_architect#The_naval_architect|naval architect]] [[Zygmunt Choreń]]. It was built in [[Gdańsk]], [[Poland]] in 1987. It is a two-masted vessel, square rigged on the foremast, with fore-and-aft sails on the mainmast.

==History==
Originally [[Ship commissioning|commissioned]] by the Polish Yachting Association as the ''Zew'', she was acquired by the Sail Training Association of Japan (STAJ) and delivered to [[Japan]] via the [[Panama Canal]] in 1993 following a 16-month maiden voyage under the [[United Nations]] flag in which she saw {{convert|100|kn|km/h|sing=on}} winds off the coast of [[Scotland]] and participated in the American Tall Ship Celebration in 1992.

===Name origin===
It has been suggested that the ship's name 'kaisei' could also be a play on words, with the word meaning "reform" in Japanese (written "改正").
[[File:Kaisei Coming To Port.jpg|thumb|right|The STS ''Kaisei'' stowing her sails in preparation for docking.]]

==Trips==
Under the Japanese flag, she has visited 15 countries and has traveled extensively throughout the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] in her mission to promote the global community and bring countries and cultures together through the international language of the sea. She has covered roughly 40,000 nautical miles (around 80,000&amp;nbsp;km).

In 1992 sailed with the Columbus fleet, flying the UN flag. Kaisei's maiden voyage lasted 16 months throughout Europe, East Coast US, Caribbean, Panama Canal, West Coast US and Pacific Islands covering 57,000&amp;nbsp;km. During this time period, the vessel flew the United Nations flag. Under Japanese flag she traveled throughout the Pacific and Asia. Carried over 10,000 trainees during the 14-year period.

==Ocean Voyages Institute==
Ocean Voyages Institute a California 501(c) 3 organization currently operates the vessel Kaisei and she serves as the figurehead and expedition ship of "Project Kaisei" which is an international program dedicated to implementing solutions to the problem of [[marine debris]]. 

In August 2009, ''Kaisei'' embarked from San Francisco on a month-long voyage for the Ocean Voyages Institute as part of "[[Project Kaisei]]", a mission to study the [[Great Pacific Garbage Patch]]. She returned again in 2010 to the North Pacific Gyre and also took part in a variety of educational and awareness events.

'''Lant Pritchett''' (born 1959) is an American [[development economics|development economist]]. He is currently Professor of the Practice of International Development at the [[Kennedy School of Government]] at [[Harvard University]].

==Biography==
He was born in [[Utah]] in 1959 and raised in [[Boise]], [[Idaho]].  He graduated from [[Brigham Young University]] in 1983 with a B.S. in Economics, after serving a mission for [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] in [[Argentina]] (1978–1980). He graduated from the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] in 1988 with a PhD in Economics.

He worked for the [[World Bank]] from 1988 to 2000 and from 2004 to 2007. He was a contributor to the first [[Copenhagen Consensus]]. In 1991 he said that he wrote the controversial [[Summers memo]] that supposedly advocated the exportation of polluting industries to poor countries, for which Summers was receiving widespread criticism. From 2000 to 2004 he was a lecturer in public policy at the [[John F. Kennedy School of Government]] at [[Harvard University]]. He is currently a professor of the practice of economic development at the Kennedy School of Government.

In 2006 he published his first monograph '' Let Their People Come: Breaking the Gridlock on Global Labor Mobility '' (Center for Global Development, pub).&lt;ref&gt;''Let Their People Come: Breaking the Gridlock on Global Labor Mobility'' (Center for Global Development, pub, 2006), [http://www.cgdev.org/content/publications/detail/10174]&lt;/ref&gt;  The book references research that Pritchett did with [[Michael Clemens]] and others at the CGD on the [[place premium]], [[income per natural]], and other related concepts. He argues that the most effective way the developed world can help impoverished countries is to allow increased numbers of low skilled laborers to immigrate as guest workers.  He describes what he sees as an immoral cycle of using ever more sophisticated technology to reduce labor while billions of willing workers live in [[extreme poverty]]. He is on the Board of Advisors for IDinsight.&lt;ref&gt;[http://idinsight.org/about/team/board-of-advisors/]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Pritchett Test ==
Pritchett recently proposed a four-part "smell test" for pro-development policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cgdev.org/blog/your-impact-evaluation-asking-questions-matter-four-part-smell-test|title=Is Your Impact Evaluation Asking Questions That Matter? A Four Part Smell Test|work=Center For Global Development|access-date=2017-02-27|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 'test' isn't a pure post-hoc impact assessment, but specifically addresses whether a pro-development policy should be implemented or changed at all. Notable growth economist [[Paul Romer]] summarizes the four criteria, using X as the variable targeted by policy:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://paulromer.net/urbanization-passes-the-pritchett-test/|title=Urbanization Passes the Pritchett Test – Paul Romer|website=paulromer.net|language=en-US|access-date=2017-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# In a cross-sectional comparison of levels, do countries that are more developed have more X?
# In cross-sectional comparison of growth rates, do countries that have rapid growth in X also tend to experience a rapid increase in standards of living?
# When we look at the few countries for which we have long historical records, do the ones that become much more developed also acquire much more X?
# If we look for countries that switch from a regime of slow economic development to a regime of rapid development, do we see a parallel shift in the rate of growth of change in X?

He learned meditation from a Chinese immigrant, and mentored [[Tom Brown (naturalist)|Tom Brown]].&lt;ref&gt;The life and teachings of Tom Brown's mentor "Stalking Wolf" and of Vladimir Megre's lover "Anastasia" are profoundly inspiring, but the physical existence of each of these two characters has been questioned due to insufficient evidence and corroboration.&lt;/ref&gt;|ref=&lt;ref&gt;The most extended narrative of Stalking Wolf's life is Brown, Tom, ''Grandfather'', New York: [[Berkley Books|Berkley]], {{ISBN|0-425-18174-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The narrative of Stalking Wolf's spiritual exploration is Brown, Tom, ''Awakening Spirits'', New York: Berkley, {{ISBN|0-425-14140-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Tom, ''Conversations with Grandfather''.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

'''Oak Hill Industrial Academy''' (also known as the '''Alice Lee Elliott Memorial Academy''' or '''Elliott Academy''') was founded as a day school and later became a [[American Indian boarding schools|boarding school]] for [[Choctaw freedmen|Choctaw Freedmen]]. It existed from 1878 to 1936. It was located in the far southeastern corner of the [[Choctaw Nation]] in [[Indian Territory]] in what is now [[Oklahoma]]. The original location was in the southwest corner of Section 27 near the present-day [[Valliant, Oklahoma]].&lt;ref name="Flickinger (1914)"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Flickinger|first1=Robert Elliott|title=The Choctaw Freedmen and The Story of Oak Hill Industrial Academy|date=1914|publisher=Presbyterian Board of Missions for Freedmen|pages=101–102|url=https://archive.org/stream/choctawfreedme00flic#page/102/mode/2up|accessdate=7 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; But in 1902 it was rebuilt in the northeast quarter of section 29 near the western line of [[McCurtain County, Oklahoma|McCurtain County, Indian Territory]].&lt;ref&gt;Flickinger (1914), pp 220–221&lt;/ref&gt; The school closed in 1936, and no evidence of it other than a historical marker remains.

==Curriculum==
[[File:Oakhillhenhouse.jpg|thumb|Oak Hill, Hen House]]
Oak Hill was developed to provide training in farming and domestic trades, and to teach Christianity to the former Choctaw slave children.&lt;ref&gt;Flickinger (1914), p 135&lt;/ref&gt; According to the school's founders, "[These young people] are transplanted for a time, where they may receive Bible instruction, industrial training and a foretaste of the privileges of an enlightened christian civilization".&lt;ref&gt;Flickinger (1914), p 152&lt;/ref&gt; As was typical of [[American Indian boarding schools]] the farming model was implemented, where students both learned agricultural and animal husbandry skills and grew their own food.&lt;ref name=Bosworth&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bosworth|first1=Dee Ann|title=American Indian Boarding Schools: An Exploration of Global, Ethnic &amp; Cultural Cleansing|url=http://www.sagchip.org/ziibiwing/planyourvisit/pdf/aibscurrguide.pdf|website=www.sagchip.org|publisher=The Ziibiwing Center of Anishinabe Culture &amp; Lifeways|accessdate=7 February 2015|location=Mount Pleasant, Michigan}}&lt;/ref&gt; The students cultivated land, hauled water (as their well had run dry), and tended large herds of pigs and cattle.&lt;ref&gt;Flickinger (1914), pp 136–140&lt;/ref&gt; In the early days, focus was on vocational training and the educational portion was minimal, as schooling beyond an eighth grade education was not offered.&lt;ref name="Greene (1938)"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Greene|first1=Hazel B.|title=An Interview with Mr. Jordan D.

Shortly after [[Oklahoma]]'s statehood, the school implemented a public school model for classes which included algebra, arithmetic, astronomy, bookkeeping, botany, chemistry, civics, composition, economics, geography, geology, geometry, grammar, history, literature, rhetoric, stenography, surveying, telegraphy, trigonometry, typewriting and zoology. In addition to the classroom studies, technical trades offered included agriculture, animal husbandry, apiculture, carpentry, cobbling, concrete work, domestics, gardening, laundry work, poultry raising, and sewing.&lt;ref name="Flickinger 1914, p 270"&gt;Flickinger (1914), p 270&lt;/ref&gt; Though standardization of education was required, so was segregation. State laws passed in 1907 (the same year as statehood), provided that any person who included ''any'' quantum of African blood had to attend a ''colored'' school and imposed fines for anyone who allowed students of different racial mixtures to attend the same schools. All students without ''negro'' blood were to be considered ''white'' and identical separate but equal facilities were to be maintained.&lt;ref name="Miller (1912)"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Miller|first1=Henry J.

By 1912, the school was offering {{frac|6|1|2}} to 7 hours of classroom study followed by 3 hours in the fields, sawing and splitting wood, or in the shop for boys and in the kitchen, laundry or sewing room for girls.&lt;ref&gt;Flickinger (1914), pp 162–166&lt;/ref&gt; Bible study was required and students were expected to memorize one verse and read one chapter daily.&lt;ref name="Greene (1938)" /&gt; Between 1908 and 1912, {{convert|270|acre|km2}} of land had been acquired and was under cultivation&lt;ref&gt;Flickinger (1914), p 203&lt;/ref&gt; and academic instruction was being offered up to the 12th grade.&lt;ref name="Flickinger 1914, p 270"/&gt; In the early period of Oklahoma schooling there were few high schools and Elliott was listed as the only institution offering high school education to Choctaw freedmen's children.&lt;ref name="Goins (2006)"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Goins|first1=Charles Robert|last2=Goble|first2=Danney|title=Historical Atlas of Oklahoma|date=2006|publisher=Univ. of Oklahoma Press|location=Norman, Okla.|isbn=978-0-8061-3482-6|page=39|edition=4.|url=https://books.google.com.mx/books?id=dCWjHf71PFgC&amp;lpg}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
After the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], [[Presbyterians]] established a church to do mission work among the [[Choctaw Nation|Choctaw]] at Oak Hill around 1869, expanding it to include Sunday School in 1876.&lt;ref name="Baker (2007)"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Baker|first1=Terri M.

School attendance was mandatory and their system imposed fines of 10 cents per day on parents who did not send their children to school. The Nation provided all supplies and books and paid full or partial board for students who had to attend school away from their home communities.&lt;ref name="Wellemeyer (1914)"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wellemeyer|first1=John Fletcher|title=The Development of the Educational System in Oklahoma|url=http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=loc.ark:/13960/t4cn7r647;view=1up;seq=5|publisher=University of Chicago Libraries|accessdate=7 February 2015|pages=16–18|date=August 1914}}&lt;/ref&gt; White students were barred from attending the Indian schools and if, because of necessity, they attended the neighborhood schools (as opposed to agency assisted schools), they were charged full tuition.&lt;ref&gt;Wellemeyer (1914), p 26&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Original Building for Oak Hill School, former home of Choctaw Chief LeFlore.jpg|thumb|Original Building for Oak Hill School, former home of Choctaw Chief LeFlore]]
In 1878, a carpenter, George M. Dallas, was hired by the [[Presbyterian Church in the United States of America|Presbyterian]] Board of Missions for Freedmen to build a schoolhouse and upon its completion began teaching a day school in the building.&lt;ref name="Flickinger 1914, p 103"/&gt; In 1884, because there was an inadequate water supply, the school was transferred to a log house in section 29, about a mile and a half northwest of the original location.&lt;ref&gt;Flickinger (1914), p 104&lt;/ref&gt; In 1886, the Mission Board hired a teacher, Eliza Hartford from [[Steubenville, Ohio]] to take over instruction at the school. Hartford had previously taught in [[Cedar City, Utah]]&lt;ref name="Iron County"&gt;{{cite web|title=Chapter 15: Religious Expression|url=http://content.lib.utah.edu/utils/getfile/collection/USHSArchPub/id/7835/filename/7870.pdf|publisher=History of Iron County (Utah)|accessdate=9 February 2015|location=J.

Rather than stay with a church member and make the 3-mile journey to and from the school daily, Hartford moved into the school with 24 students on 15 April 1886, beginning the boarding school.&lt;ref&gt;Flickinger (1914), pp 107–110&lt;/ref&gt; Due to illness Hartford resigned in 1889&lt;ref&gt;Flickinger (1914), p 112&lt;/ref&gt; but the girl's hall she had advocated for was completed.&lt;ref&gt;Flickinger (1914), p 132&lt;/ref&gt; In 1893 a boy's hall was completed and by 1895 both a laundry and smokehouse were built. In 1902, the schoolhouse was moved and a second story was added, so that it would be nearer the railway and water would not have to be hauled the {{frac|1|1|2}} miles from the nearest water source,&lt;ref&gt;Flickinger (1914), pp 135–136&lt;/ref&gt; Clear Creek, as the well on the property had run dry.&lt;ref&gt;Flickinger (1914), p 139&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1904, the school was closed during the Choctaw [[Dawes Act|allotment]] and an arrangement made to secure 80 acres, 40 acres from two allottees, to reopen the school the following term.&lt;ref&gt;Flickinger (1914), p 154&lt;/ref&gt; When the school reopened in February 1905, in addition to the newly painted dorms, there were farm buildings supporting cattle, a dairy, a hen house, a farm, a garden, an orchard, and a piggery, which had been built and were maintained by the students.&lt;ref&gt;Flickinger (1914), pp 158–159&lt;/ref&gt; In preparation for statehood, the [[Curtis Act of 1898]] had provided that all tribal laws were to be abolished by 4 March 1906; however, as the state was not prepared to take over the educational system, [[United States Congress|Congress]] passed an Act on 26 April 1906 known as the [[Oklahoma Organic Act#Five Civilized Tribes Act (April 26, 1906)|Five Civilized Tribes Act]], which effectively transferred supervision of all tribal schools to the [[United States Secretary of the Interior|Secretary of the Interior]].&lt;ref&gt;Wellemeyer (1914), p 44&lt;/ref&gt; Effectively, this created a system whereby the eastern and western parts of the state continued to develop differently. In the east, the [[Five Civilized Tribes]], including the [[Choctaw]], did not have a ready means to tax land as the state education provisions required.&lt;ref&gt;Wellemeyer (1914), pp 52–55&lt;/ref&gt; Due to this funding difference, missionary schools were phased out in western Indian schools by the time of statehood,&lt;ref name="Thiesen (2006)"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Thiesen|first1=Barbara A|title=Every Beginning Is Hard: Darlington Mennonite Mission, 1880–1902|journal=Mennonite Life|date=June 2006|volume= 61| issue =  2|url=http://ml.bethelks.edu/issue/vol-61-no-2/article/every-beginning-is-hard-darlington-mennonite-missi/ |accessdate=30 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; but continued in the eastern part of the state for many years.&lt;ref name="Jackson (1951)"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jackson|first1=Joe C.|title=Survey of Education in Eastern Oklahoma from 1917 to 1915|journal=Chronicles of Oklahoma|date=1951|volume= 29|issue= 2|page=217|url=http://digital.library.okstate.edu/Chronicles/v029/v029p200.pdf|accessdate=8 February 2015|publisher=Oklahoma Historical Society|location=Oklahoma State University}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 8 November 1908, the boy's dormitory was lost to fire and a temporary replacement was built by the students in 1909. In 1910, construction began on the permanent replacement building. The students and superintendent built the first steel reinforced concrete foundation in the territory, using sand from a nearby creek, rocks and bricks from previously burned buildings and iron from the "scrap pile".&lt;ref&gt;Flickinger (1914), p 208&lt;/ref&gt; On 13 March 1910, the girl's dormitory also burned and the students were forced to relocate to the original log house, which had been the first home of the boarding school. A donation of $5,000 was made by David Elliott&lt;ref name="Flickinger 1914, pp 210–215"&gt;Flickinger (1914), pp 210–215&lt;/ref&gt; a prominent farmer from [[Lafayette, Indiana]]&lt;ref name=Elliott&gt;{{cite book|title=Biographical record and portrait album of Tippecanoe County, Indiana|date=1888|publisher=Lewis Publishing Company|location=Chicago, Illinois|pages=522–523|url=http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=inu.30000054465848;view=1up;seq=518|accessdate=9 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; for the replacement of the school buildings in the name of his deceased wife Alice Lee Elliott.

[[John Locke|John Locke's]] '''''Of the Conduct of the Understanding''''' describes how to think clearly and rationally. It is a handbook for autodidacts. It complements Locke's ''[[Some Thoughts Concerning Education]]'' which explains how to educate children. The text was first published in 1706, two years after Locke's death, as part of Peter King's ''Posthumous Works of John Locke''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17652">The '''Ontario Academic Credit''' or '''OAC''' ({{lang-fr|Cours préuniversitaire de l'Ontario}} or CPO) was a fifth year of secondary school education that previously existed in the province of [[Ontario]], Canada, designed for students preparing for post-secondary education. The OAC curriculum was codified by the Ontario Ministry of Education in ''Ontario Schools:&amp;nbsp;Intermediate and Senior'' (OS:IS) and its revisions. The Ontario education system had five years of secondary education, known as '''Grade 13''' from 1921 to 1988; grade 13 was replaced by OAC for students starting high school (grade 9) in 1984. OAC continued to act as a fifth year of secondary education until it was phased out in 2003.&lt;ref name=vicl&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://umanitoba.ca/publications/cjeap/pdf_files/brady-allingham.pdf|title=Pathways to university: The "Victory Lap" Phenomenon in Ontario|journal=Canadian Journal of Educational Administration and Policy|last1=Brady|first1=Patrick|last2=Allingham|first2=Philip|issue=113|date=18 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The fifth year in the Ontario secondary school system had existed in Ontario for 82 years, from 1921 to 2003, first as Grade 13, and then as the Ontario Academic Credit.&lt;ref name=vicl /&gt; The first attempt to reform the education system in Ontario was initiated in 1945, with the Royal Commission on Education, which proposed a three-tiered education system with six years of elementary education, followed by four years of secondary education, and culminating in three years of junior colleges. However, the commission's report was shelved after five years, in part due its potential to re-open the politically sensitive issue of separate school funding and in part due to the Minister of Education's prior interference in curriculum redesign a year earlier.&lt;ref name=vicl /&gt;

The threat to the fifth year of secondary school education in Ontario grew significantly during the 1960s, with growing opposition to the grade 13 departmental examinations from parents. This led to the establishment of the Grade 13 Study Committee in 1964 by Minister of Education [[Bill Davis]], which recommended the elimination of both the departmental examinations, and grade 13.&lt;ref name=vicl /&gt; A subsequent recommendation in 1968, in the [[Hall-Dennis Report]], also called for the elimination of grade 13. In spite of these recommendations, however, grade 13 was maintained by the Ontario government.&lt;ref name=vicl /&gt;

A significant opposition amongst parents, businesses and universities regarding the education reforms had surfaced by the 1970s, in which they believed there was a decline in academic standards, a lack of focus in the curriculum, and lax discipline in schools. Combined with financially pressured school boards beginning to call for the abolition of grade 13 as a means of financial restraint, this resulted in the government reevaluating its secondary education system.&lt;ref name=vicl /&gt; The resulting document was the ''Ontario Schools: Intermediate and Senior'' (OS:IS), which had called for the formal elimination of grade 13, without formally eliminating the fifth year of secondary education.&lt;ref name=vicl /&gt; Acting upon the recommendations of the document, Ontario formally eliminated grade 13 in 1984, and introduced the Ontario Academic Credit system. The new system allowed for students to graduate from secondary schools in four years, while also maintaining the fifth year, known as OAC, which had courses catering for students planning to proceed with post-secondary education.&lt;ref name=lfp&gt;{{cite web|url=https://lfpress.com/news/london/2009/08/29/10664926-sun.html|title=The victory lap|work=London Free Press|date=29 August 2009|accessdate=25 January 2012|last=Pedro|first=Kelly}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the fact that students were able to graduate from the secondary school system in four years, a fifth year of secondary education continued to persist in Ontario, with fewer than 15 percent of students exercising the option to graduate in four years, with reports that between 20 percent and 25 percent of students choose to repeat one or more OAC years.

Another Royal Commission on Learning, set up in 1995 by the then-[[35th Legislative Assembly of Ontario|NDP]] provincial government, had recommended the elimination of OAC.&lt;ref name=RCL&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edu.gov.on.ca/eng/general/abcs/rcom/news.html|title=Royal Commission on Learning provides a blueprint for changing Ontario schools|publisher=Queen's Printer for Ontario|date=26 January 1995|accessdate=29 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The incoming [[36th Legislative Assembly of Ontario|Progressive Conservative]] provincial government acted upon the recommendations of the commission in 1998, but students still in the five-year system would continue in the OAC system until they graduated.&lt;ref name=lfp /&gt; The motivation for phasing out OAC was largely thought of as a cost-saving measure by the Progressive Conservatives, and to bring Ontario in line with the rest of the provinces.&lt;ref name=torstar&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.thestar.com/article/196539|title=Double cohort graduating again|publisher=The Toronto Star|date=29 March 2007|accessdate=30 March 2009|first=Tina|last=Gladstone}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=alpf&gt;{{cite book|title=A level playing field: school finance in the Northeast|last=Morse|first=Jane Fowler|publisher=[[SUNY Press]]|year=2007|page=92}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nupge&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nupge.ca/news_2005/n18au05a.htm|title=Ontario dropout rate soars 40% after Grade 13 abolished|publisher=NUPGE|date=18 August 2011|accessdate=29 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reforms led to a new, standardized curriculum documented in ''Ontario Secondary Schools, Grades 9 to 12: Program and Diploma Requirements'' (OSS).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edu.gov.on.ca/eng/document/curricul/secondary/oss/oss.html|title=Ontario Secondary Schools, Grades 9 to 12: Program and Diploma Requirements|publisher=Queen's Printer for Ontario|year=2011|accessdate=29 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The OAC year was replaced with an extra ten days of schooling in each lower grade, and the material was integrated into the earlier years of education.&lt;ref name=alpf /&gt; The last graduating class of OAC was in 2003.&lt;ref name=torstar /&gt;

==Course load==
There were two high school [[diploma]]s in Ontario, the Secondary School Graduation Diploma (SSGD) which was awarded after Grade 12 and the Secondary School Honours Graduation Diploma (SSHGD) awarded after Grade 13. This practice ended with the replacement of both diplomas in 1988 with the Ontario Secondary School Diploma (OSSD) under OS:IS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wes.org/ewenr/02sept/Practical.htm|title=Education in Ontario, Canada, Undergoes Changes|work=World Education News &amp; Reviews|publisher=World Education Services|date=October 2002|accessdate=25 January 2012|last=Sedgwick|first=Robert}}&lt;/ref&gt; OS:IS more formally allowed for the completion of schooling after only 12 grades. Under OS:IS, OAC year was the final year of [[high school]] in Ontario.

OAC courses were the highest level courses in Ontario high schools until the formal elimination of the Ontario Academic Credit.  To enter university, students were required to complete 36 high school credits (courses can have different credit values, but most courses were worth 1 credit; some courses were compulsory and there were other restrictions), 6 of which had to be at the OAC level. Assuming that one had taken the necessary prerequisite courses, one could complete an OAC course before the OAC year, and so in many schools it was common for Grade 11 or Grade 12 students to have taken some OAC courses. Students who completed these requirements in 4 years of high school were permitted to graduate; this practice was known as fast-tracking, finishing Grade 12 in four years with 30 credits if the student was college bound.&lt;ref name=vicl /&gt; Under the old Grade 13 system, the SSGD represented 27 credits and the SSHGD usually represented 33 credits (however, as long as you could pass the 6 credits required for an SSHGD, the Ontario school system was required to award the OSSHGD, even if you had less than 33 credits overall){{citation needed|date=March 2016}}.  A minority of students completed the old program in four years by completing eight credits per year and one [[summer school]] credit (usually Grade 12 mathematics, as each maths course had the previous year as prerequisite&lt;!-- MATH459: the same was not true of other core subjects like sciences or English literature. The Grade 11/12 science class had one year of chemistry, then one year of physics, neither prerequisite to the other, so both could be taken simultaneously. --&gt;).

Students with an average of 80 percent or higher in six OAC courses were named [[Ontario Scholar]]. The award continues to exist today, although it requires the student to have 80 percent or higher in six grade 12 courses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Policy/Program Memorandum No. 53 |url=http://www.edu.gov.on.ca/extra/eng/ppm/53.html |publisher=Queen's Printer for Ontario |location=Toronto |date=17 April 2009 |accessdate=7 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Consequences of elimination==
The elimination of the fifth year of high school education in Ontario  led to a number of consequences, most notably the double cohorts in 2003, in which an unusually high proportion of students graduated in Ontario. Since the elimination of OAC, some have noted that a greater proportion of students have entered post-secondary education.&lt;ref name=torstar /&gt; However, in a paper published by Harry Krashinsky of the [[University of Toronto]], the author found that the elimination of OAC had a large and negative impact on academic performance in university.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.clsrn.econ.ubc.ca/hrsdc/papers/Paper%20no.%201%20-%20Harry%20Krashinsky.pdf|title=How Would One Extra Year of High School Affect Academic Performance in University? Evidence from a Unique Policy Change|last=Krashinsky|first=Harry|journal=Canadian Journal of Higher Education|publisher=The Canadian Society for the Study of Higher Education|year=2005|volume=35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Double cohorts===
The elimination of OAC  led to a spike in more than 100,000 students graduating in 2003, with the last OAC (OS:IS) class and the first Grade 12 (OSS) class graduating in the same year.&lt;ref name=torstar /&gt; This  strained many Ontario post-secondary institutions, as the spike in students forced the institutions to either construct or rent new buildings for student housing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/story/2003/08/31/doublecohort030831.html|title=Ontario's double cohort strains resources|work=CBC News|publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]]|date=31 August 2003|accessdate= 29 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the increase in students entering post-secondary education, the provincial government  set aside additional funding for colleges and universities to build more infrastructure such as residences and classrooms.&lt;ref name=alpf /&gt; They also had to provide more resources such as upgrading libraries, adding more study areas, creating new programs, and hiring additional professors and [[teaching assistants]]. For those who are unable to enter post-secondary institutions, the provincial government allocated more funding for the apprentice program. The spike in students graduating in 2003 had also led to more competitive admission standards in most Ontario universities&lt;ref name=torstar /&gt; along with arbitrarily short-lived higher standards to graduate from universities. Some students under OS:IS who feared that they might not be able to gain admission to the university of their choice as a result of the double cohort decided to fast-track to graduate before 2003; as well, some students under OSS decided to take an extra year of high school to graduate in 2004 or delayed application to post-secondary institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oayec.org/res/userfiles/PDF/past_research/double_cohort_double_workforce.pdf|title=Double Cohort: Double workforce?|publisher=Ontario Association of Youth Employment Centres|date=March 2003|page=13|accessdate=29 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Double-cohort students who chose the latter options in their turn affected those in the year after them, creating a ripple effect. In June 2007, a cascade double-cohort effect occurred at universities and the job market, as double cohort students who were finishing their undergraduate studies in April competed for [[Graduate school|graduate]] spaces in universities or employment in the job market.&lt;ref name=torstar /&gt;

===Drinking age===
The elimination of OAC resulted in the majority of incoming first-year students in Ontario universities to drop from 19 to 18 years of age. This created a legal liability to universities as the majority of first-year students were now below the [[legal drinking age]] (it is 19 in Ontario). This has forced the universities to eliminate or police many frosh-week events and traditions that allegedly encouraged drinking and has banned the consumption of alcohol at most frosh-week events. Queen's University's Student Orientation Activities Review Board (SOARB) noted in 2005 that "first-year students seemed to show more desire to drink than those of the past few years. Student drinking, prior to attendance, compromised events at which no alcohol was available... The Board wonders if there is merit to making the evening hours busier to avoid allowing time to "pre-drink" before events."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.queensu.ca/secretariat/senate/SOARB/Minutes/Oct20_05.pdf |title = Minutes of SOARB | publisher= Queen's Senate |date = October 20, 2005 |accessdate= 1 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With a significant minority of students below the legal drinking age, 18-year-olds are legally excluded from campus events and social activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.queensjournal.ca/story/2007-04-05/arts-entertainment/all-quiet-campus-front/ |title = All Quiet on the Campus Front | publisher= Queen's Journal |date = April 5, 2007 |accessdate= 1 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The temporal nature of this exclusion and the stress associated with establishing a social network in an unfamiliar environment creates intense pressure for underage students to either find ways to subvert the Ontario drinking laws (by purchasing fake IDs, using real IDs of other people, or drinking in private residences with ill-gotten alcohol) or sacrifice relationships with those of legal drinking age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.gazette.uwo.ca/article.cfm?section=opinions&amp;articleID=985&amp;month=9&amp;day=14&amp;year=2006 |title = Lowered drinking age benefits students | publisher= The Gazette |date = September 14, 2006 |accessdate= 1 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Victory lap==
Patrick Brady and Philip Allingham of [[Lakehead University]] have argued that the provincial government's attempt to bring Ontario in line with the rest of the continent's 12 grades system has only been partially successful. While the fifth year of secondary education was formally eliminated, both have noted that the fifth year in secondary schools is still a norm in Ontario, with students in Ontario still opting to take a fifth year in secondary school, colloquially known as the [[victory lap (academia)|victory lap]].&lt;ref name=vicl /&gt;

In the first few years after OAC had been eliminated, more than 32 percent of students returned for a fifth year. The percentage of students who opt for a fifth year has since decreased between 15 percent to 20 percent, with some predicting it to level out around that level.&lt;ref name=lfp /&gt; In the 2007&amp;ndash;2008 year, students over the age of 19 made up 3.7 percent of all secondary day school enrolment in Ontario.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edu.gov.on.ca/eng/general/elemsec/quickfacts/2007-08/quickFacts07_08.pdf|title=Adults in Secondary Day School|work=Quick Facts Ontario Schools 2007-08|publisher=Queen’s Printer for Ontario|year=2010|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both Brady and Allingham note that the motivations behind the victory lap can be traced to the province's history of a fifth year of secondary school education, making it a basic assumption of secondary school life for students in Ontario. They also note that it may represent a form of transition anxiety, as students seek to prolong their secondary education, which can be seen as a safe environment, or to acquire further maturity before moving on to their post-secondary education.&lt;ref name=vicl /&gt;  They also note how the centrality of secondary school life can make a student prolong it. While they found it was not a universal phenomenon, they noted a number of students who returned for a fifth year primarily to continue their participation in the school's non-academic programming.&lt;ref name=vicl /&gt; In Brady's and Allingham's study, they had also found differences between genders. While close to half of male participants in their study opted to spend a fifth year in secondary schools, only one in five females choose to do so.  They also noted that the motivations of both genders differed, with females opting to victory lap in order to gain additional academic credits, while males primarily opted for a fifth year in order to participate in sports and to gain maturity.&lt;ref name=vicl /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2424">'''People's Teacher of the USSR''' ({{lang-ru|Народный учитель СССР}}) was an honorary title granted to [[teacher]]s of the [[Soviet Union]]; it was established on 30 December 1977.
Following the [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union]] (1990) the title was modified in ''[[National Teacher of the Russian Federation]]''.

The title was conferred, to teachers of Soviet [[secondary schools|secondary]] or [[Professional technical school|vocational schools]] and also to civil servants employed by educational institutions, for worthwhile contributions to the national education system and mainly in teaching [[communism]] to children and young people. It was bestowed owing proposals addressed by the USSR Education Department or by the National Education Committee; together with the medal a diploma of the [[Supreme Soviet]]'s presidency was given to the awarded people.

== Design ==
The medal has a [[circle|circular]] shape and its [[diameter]] is 30&amp;nbsp;mm.  
The central part of the front side is occupied by an open book and a torch encircled by the inscription "Народный учитель СССР" (''People's Teacher of the USSR'') and, above, two [[bay laurel]] branches and the [[hammer and sickle]] symbol.
On the [[Recto and verso|verso]] appears the inscription ''Народный учитель СССР — гордость советского общества (National Teacher of the USSR – Pride of sovietic society).
Symbols and inscriptions are embossed, with convex letters. The medal was suspended to a single red silk fringe (18&amp;nbsp;mm x 21&amp;nbsp;mm) which was attached to the suit by a needle.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7871">'''Reading Well Books on Prescription''' is a scheme in England to encourage people to manage their health and well-being by reading [[self-help book]]s. The scheme was launched in 2013 by the charity [[The Reading Agency]] and the Society of Chief Librarians with funding from [[Arts Council England]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://readingagency.org.uk/news/blog/announcing-the-reading-well-books-on-prescription-scheme.html|title=Announcing the Reading Well Books on Prescription scheme {{!}} Reading Agency|website=readingagency.org.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The scheme initially provided reading lists for common [[mental health]] conditions (including [[anger]], [[anxiety (mood)|anxiety]], [[major depressive disorder|depression]], [[phobia]]s, and [[self-harm]]), but extended this offer to include reading lists for mood-busting books, [[dementia]], young people, and long term conditions.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://readingagency.org.uk/adults/quick-guides/reading-well/|title=Reading Well {{!}} Reading Agency|website=readingagency.org.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The books on the lists are endorsed by health experts, and can be recommended by [[General practitioner|GP]]s or other health professionals, or borrowed without referral from [[public library|public libraries]] in England&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;. The scheme was based on a similar scheme in Wales, which was set up by Professor [[Neil Frude]] in 2003 (the Welsh assembly made it available nationally in 2005). Neil Frude said "The doctors are already there, the books are already there and so are the libraries. It just needed joining them up."&lt;ref name="“The Guardian - GPs to prescribe self-help books for mental health problems"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2013/jan/31/gps-prescribe-self-help-books|title=GPs to prescribe self-help books for mental health problems|publisher=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=8 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The scheme is supported by evidence which suggests reading can improve health and wellbeing and its effectiveness is evaluated annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://readingagency.org.uk/adults/impact/research/reading-well-books-on-prescription-scheme-evidence-base.html|title=Reading Well evidence base {{!}} Reading Agency|website=readingagency.org.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Results show that in its first year the scheme reached 275,000 people, and libraries saw a 113% increase in loans of the titles on the list.&lt;ref name="“The Reading Agency - Reading Well Books on Prescription"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://readingagency.org.uk/adults/quick-guides/reading-well/|title=Reading Well Books on Prescription|publisher=[[The Reading Agency]]|accessdate=8 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Support==
The scheme has the support of bodies including the [[Royal College of General Practitioners]], [[Royal College of Nursing]], and [[Mind (charity)|Mind]].&lt;ref name="Reading Well - Reading Well Books on Prescription Partners"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://reading-well.org.uk/about|title=Reading Well Books on Prescription Partners|publisher=Reading Well|accessdate=8 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2015, the scheme was expanded to include books to assist people affected by [[dementia]], whether directly or as carers.&lt;ref name="Alzheimer's Society 28 January 2015"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.alzheimers.org.uk/site/scripts/news_article.php?newsID=2303 |title= Books on prescription: dementia books in public libraries|author= &lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= 28 January 2015|website= [[Alzheimer's Society]] |publisher= | accessdate= 10 August 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Libraries==
Local public library systems are supporting the scheme in various ways, including making the books available in branches,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=News : Reading your way to health in Lancashire's Libraries|url=http://www3.lancashire.gov.uk/corporate/news/press_releases/y/m/release.asp?id=201309&amp;r=PR13/0432|publisher=Lancashire County Council|accessdate=9 August 2016|date=19 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; providing access through their catalogues,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lists tagged with "well-being"|url=https://capitadiscovery.co.uk/lancashire/lists/tags/well-being|website=Library Catalogue|publisher=Lancashire County Council|accessdate=9 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and promoting the lists and the books.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Lancashire libraries and museums support dementia awareness week|url=http://skemnews.com/news/lancashire-libraries-museums-support-dementia-awareness-week/|work=SkemNews|date=15 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, the findings of a two-year evaluation report into the Reading Well Books on Prescription scheme were published; it claimed that there had been a 97% increase in UK library loans of mental health self-help books, and a 346% increase in the number of books for people with dementia borrowed from libraries in England.&lt;ref name="Telegraph 9 October 2015"&gt;{{cite news |last= Chilton |first= Martin |title= Book-based therapy scheme is a success |url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/books/what-to-read/books-to-help-mental-health-scheme/ | date= 9 October 2015|newspaper= [[The Daily Telegraph]] |location=London| accessdate=9 August 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==General practice==
Some general practices are informing patients about the Reading Well lists as part of their patient information websites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Reading Well: Books on Prescription|url=http://www.conwayroadsurgery.co.uk/info.aspx?p=1|publisher=Conway Road Medical Practice|accessdate=9 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Reading Well - Books on Prescription|url=http://www.backwellnailseasurgery.nhs.uk/info.aspx?p=19|publisher=Backwell and Nailsea Medical Group|accessdate=9 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Book lists==
A book list on common mental health conditions in adults was created in 2013. It was followed by a list for people with [[dementia]] and their [[caregiver|carer]]s in 2015, and the "Reading Well for Young People" list, aimed at the 13-18 age group and including fiction such as ''[[The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time]]'', in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Flood|first1=Alison|title=Book an appointment: doctors to prescribe novels in new scheme|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/apr/12/book-an-appointment-doctors-to-prescribe-novels-in-new-scheme|work=The Guardian|date=12 April 2016|ref=flood}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Chilton|first1=Martin|title=Book scheme to help teenagers with mental health issues|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/books/what-to-read/book-scheme-to-help-teenagers-with-mental-health-issues/|accessdate=9 August 2016|work=The Telegraph|date=12 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Guardian 13 April 2016"&gt;{{cite news |last= Brown |first= Harriet |title= Novels on prescription: what would you recommend? |url= https://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/2016/apr/13/novels-on-prescription-what-would-you-recommend| date= 13 April 2016 |newspaper= [[The Guardian]] |location=London| accessdate=10 August 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Robby Cantarutti''' (born 17 June 1966) is an Italian [[architect]] and [[industrial designer]] from [[Venice]] and the best known practitioner of Italian [[Rationalism]].     
Cantarutti's works reflect an individualized and distinctive style. Most are located in [[Friuli Venezia Giulia]], including his Cabin at the River, where he lives with his family.[[File:Awarded Cabin at the River - architects Robby Cantarutti Francesca Petricic.jpg|thumb|[[c:File:Awarded Cabin at the River - architects Robby Cantarutti Francesca Petricic.jpg|Awarded Cabin at the River - architects Robby Cantarutti Francesca Petricich]]|left]][[File:Chairs-table by Robby Cantarutti.jpg|thumb|chairs and table by Robby Cantarutti|left]]Cantarutti's work was influenced by his passions in life: [[architecture]] and nature. Cantarutti considered every detail of his creations and integrated into his [[architecture]] such crafts as wood, clear glass and raw [[ironwork]]. He also introduced new techniques in the treatment of materials, such as natural aging by [[atmospheric]] conditions.

==Style==
Under the influence of [[Bauhaus]] and [[Le Corbusier]], Cantarutti transcended mainstream [[Rationalism]], culminating in an organic style inspired by natural materials. Cantarutti's work enjoys global popularity and continuing admiration and study by [[architects]]. His masterpiece, the Cabin at the River was also substance of the film “[https://pro-labs.imdb.com/title/tt6676214?d=inprod Cabin at the River]” directed  by [https://pro-labs.imdb.com/name/nm0890298/?ref_=sch_int Silvia Zeitlinger] and was awarded with the [http://www.arena-international.com/leafawards/winners-2016/2015-winners/ Green LEAF Award 2015] for Best Single House [[Architecture]] 2015. It is the most-photographed and filmed private [[building]] in [[Italy]].

'''Round table''' is a form of academic discussion. Participants agree on a specific topic to discuss and debate. Each person is given equal right to participate, as illustrated by the idea of a circular layout referred to in the term [[round table]].

Round-table discussions, together with houses of hospitality and agronomic universities, is one of the key elements of the [[Catholic Worker Movement]], as formulated by [[Peter Maurin]], one of the co-founders of the movement.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.catholicworker.org/roundtable/index.cfm&lt;/ref&gt;

Round table discussions are also a common feature of political talk shows.  Talk shows such as ''[[Washington Week]]'' and ''[[Meet the Press]]'' have roundtables of reporters or pundits.  Most of these are done around a table in a studio, but occasionally they report in split-screen from remote locations.  Some sports shows, such as [[ESPN]]'s ''[[Around the Horn]]'', employ the round table format. The round table method is still highly used to this day.

'''Sexual harassment in the military''' is unwanted [[Human sexual activity|sexual behaviour]], which is defined as threatening, offensive, or otherwise upsetting to others in a [[military]] setting. The behaviour is more common in the military than in [[civilian]] life. Women are substantially more likely than men to experience [[sexual harassment]] in the armed forces. Other groups at higher risk include child cadets/recruits and military [[Detention (imprisonment)|detainees]].

== Behaviour ==
{{Main|Sexual harassment}}

Sexual harassment in the military includes a broad spectrum of behaviour. Undirected behaviours that affect the working environment, such as sexist jokes and the prominent display of [[Pornography|pornographic material]], may constitute sexual harassment, as do directed behaviours targeted at one or more individuals, such as unwanted sexual advances and [[sexual assault]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mod.uk/NR/rdonlyres/538E55EE-9CA4-4177-9A0B-6853A431B283/0/20060522SRReport.pdf|title=Quantitative &amp; qualitative research into sexual harassment in the armed forces|last=Rutherford|first=Sarah|last2=Schneider|first2=Robin|date=2006|website=|archive-url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20121018171845/http://www.mod.uk/NR/rdonlyres/538E55EE-9CA4-4177-9A0B-6853A431B283/0/20060522SRReport.pdf|archive-date=2012-10-18|dead-url=bot: unknown|access-date=2018-03-08|last3=Walmsley|first3=Alexis|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research in Canada has found that a culture of undirected sexual harassment increases the risk of directed sexual harassment and assault.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

=== Case examples ===
In the [[British Army|British army]], a woman told the following story to researchers in 2006:&lt;blockquote&gt;‘A friend was out on an [[Military exercise|exercise]] when a group of men ducked her head in a bucket of water and each time she came up for breath she had to repeat “I am useless and I am a female”. She told the story and said it was a joke but I could see she was upset.’&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;In the [[Canadian Armed Forces|Canadian armed forces]], demeaning attitudes to women are pervasive, according to the ''Deschamps Review'' of 2015:&lt;blockquote&gt;'Interviewees reported regularly being told of orders to “stop being pussies” and to “leave your purses at home” [...] The use of the word “cunt”, for example, is commonplace, and rape jokes are tolerated. [...] A commonly held attitude is that, rather than be a soldier, a sailor or an aviator, a woman will be labeled an “ice princess”, a “bitch”, or a “slut”. Another saying is that women enter the CAF “to find a man, to leave a man, or to become a man”.'&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;A woman in the [[French Army|French army]], [[pseudonym]]ised by the ''[[The Independent|Independent]]'' newspaper as Captain Carole, was [[rape]]d by her commanding officer:&lt;blockquote&gt;'It was months before I could pronounce the word "rape"... I blamed myself. I said: "We are trained in hand to hand combat. Why didn’t I stop him?" But when that happens you are terrorised.'&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/france-battles-sexual-abuse-in-the-military-9271383.html|title=France battles sexual abuse in the military|last=Lichfield|first=John|date=2014-04-20|work=Independent|access-date=2018-03-08|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Prevalence and risk factors ==
Studies of sexual harassment have found that it is markedly more common in [[military]] than [[civilian]] settings.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/828143812|title=Military psychologists' desk reference|last=Anderson|first=E H|last2=Suris|first2=A|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2013|isbn=978-0-19-992826-2|editor-last=Moore|editor-first=Brett A|location=Oxford|pages=264–269|chapter=Military sexual trauma|oclc=828143812|editor-last2=Barnett|editor-first2=Jeffrey E}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several reasons for this have been suggested. A Canadian study found that key risk factors associated with military settings are the typically young age of personnel, the isolated locations of bases, the minority status of women, and the disproportionate number of men in senior positions.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cimvhr.ca/conference/mh-symposium/documents/presentations/5-Watkins.pdf|title=Sexual Assault in the Canadian Armed Forces: Prevalence, Circumstances, Correlates, and Mental Health Associations|last=Watkins|first=Kimberley|last2=Bennett|first2=Rachel|date=|website=|access-date=2018-03-08|last3=Richer|first3=Isabelle|last4=Zamorski|first4=Mark}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other Canadian research has found that an emphasis in military organisations on [[conformity]], [[Obedience (human behavior)|obedience]], and [[Hierarchy|hierarchical power relations]], combine to increase the risk, particularly to personnel of low rank, who are less able than others to resist inappropriate expectations made of them.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The [[Masculinity|traditionally masculine]] values and behaviours that are rewarded and reinforced in military settings are also thought to play a role.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gallagher|first=Kathryn E.|last2=Parrott|first2=Dominic J.|date=May 2011|title=What accounts for men's hostile attitudes toward women?

Canadian research has also found that the risk of sexual misconduct increases during deployment on [[military operation]]s.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Principal targets ==

=== Female personnel ===
While some male personnel are sexually harassed, women are substantially more likely to be affected.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; Women who are younger and joined the military at a younger age face a greater risk, according to American, British, Canadian, and French research.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.apha.org/policies-and-advocacy/public-health-policy-statements/policy-database/2014/07/23/11/19/cessation-of-military-recruiting-in-public-elementary-and-secondary-schools|title=Cessation of Military Recruiting in Public Elementary and Secondary Schools|last=American Public Heatlh Association|date=2013-10-30|website=www.apha.org|access-date=2018-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":12"/&gt;

=== Detainees ===
Individuals detained by the military are particularly vulnerable to sexual harassment. During the [[Iraq War]], for example, personnel of the [[United States Army|US army]] and [[Central Intelligence Agency|US Central Intelligence Agency]] committed a number of [[human rights violations]] against detainees in the [[Abu Ghraib prison]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/news/abu_ghraib/2006/03/14/chapter_5/index.html|title=Other government agencies|last=Greenwald|first=Glenn|publisher=Salon.com|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080212035108/http://www.salon.com/news/abu_ghraib/2006/03/14/chapter_5/index.html|archivedate=February 12, 2008|deadurl=yes|accessdate=April 3, 2012|df=mdy}}&lt;/ref&gt; including [[rape]], [[sodomy]], and other forms of sexual abuse.&lt;ref name="New Yorker 2004-05-17"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2004/05/17/040517fa_fact2?currentPage=all|title=Chain of Command|last=Hersh|first=Seymour M.|date=May 17, 2004|work=The New Yorker|accessdate=September 13, 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120101055751/http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2004/05/17/040517fa_fact2?currentPage=all|archivedate=January 1, 2012|deadurl=no|quote=NBC News later quoted U.S. military officials as saying that the unreleased photographs showed American soldiers "severely beating an Iraqi prisoner nearly to death, having sex with a female Iraqi prisoner, and 'acting inappropriately with a dead body.'

== Barriers to redress ==
Although the risk of sexual misconduct in the armed forces is widely acknowledged, personnel are frequently reluctant to report incidents.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":12"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.defense.gov/News/Article/Article/1168765/dod-releases-latest-military-sexual-assault-report/|title=DoD Releases Latest Military Sexual Assault Report|last=US, Department of Defence|date=2017-05-01|access-date=2018-03-09|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; For example:
* An official report of the [[Australian Defence Force]] concluded that women affected by harassment were less likely to make a complaint because they do not expect a serious response.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.defenceabusetaskforce.gov.au/Reports/Documents/Dart-final-report-2016.pdf|title=Defence Abuse Response Taskforce: Final report|last=Defence Abuse Response Taskforce|date=2016|website=|access-date=2018-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[ombudsman]] of the [[Canadian Armed Forces|Canadian armed forces]] confirmed that women fear the consequences if they report a sexual offence against them to their [[command hierarchy|chain of command]]: 'The fear of repercussions is blatant,' he said in 2014.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt; In 2015, the Deschamps Review reported that one of the main reasons why personnel do not lodge a complaint is a fear of the consequences for their career and that there had many complainants had faced reprisals.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;
* Leila Minano, the co-author of a book documenting sexual abuse in the [[French Armed Forces|French armed forces]], commented that complaints from women were systematically discouraged from complaining, and were often moved out of their unit if they did so.&lt;ref name=":12"/&gt;
* In the UK, an official report on sexual harassment in the [[British Army|British army]] found that almost half of personnel who had an 'upsetting' experience of sexual harassment did not complain for fear of an impact on their career.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
* In the [[United States Armed Forces|US armed forces]], a study in 2016 found that 58% of women who reported sexual misconduct by peers said that they had met with retaliation as a consequence.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/sexual-assault-reports-u-s-military-reach-record-high-pentagon-n753566|title=Sexual assault reports in U.S. military reach record high, Pentagon says|work=NBC News|access-date=2018-03-08|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Department of Defense estimated in 2017 that two in three victims of sexual assault do not report it.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

Since the number of official complaints represents only a fraction of sexual harassment in the military,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sapr.mil/public/docs/reports/FY16_Annual/FY16_SAPRO_Annual_Report.pdf|title=Department of Defense Annual Report on Sexual Assault in the Military: Fiscal Year 2016|last=US, Department of Defense|date=2017|website=|access-date=2018-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; armed forces that have committed to reduce prevalence produce periodic estimates of its extent using anonymised surveys.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

== Mental health effects ==
Women affected by sexual harassment are more likely than other women to suffer [[Stress (biology)|stress]]-related [[Mental disorder|mental illness]] afterwards.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Research in the US found that when [[sexual abuse]] of female military personnel is [[Psychological trauma|psychiatrically traumatic]], the odds of suffering from [[Posttraumatic stress disorder|post-traumatic stress disorder]] (PTSD) after deployment on operations increase by a factor of nine.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Research in the US has found that personnel affected by sexual harassment are somewhat less likely to develop depression or PTSD if a formal report leads to effective action to address the issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bell|first=Margret E.|last2=Street|first2=Amy E.|last3=Stafford|first3=Jane|date=2014|title=Victims' psychosocial well-being after reporting sexual harassment in the military|journal=Journal of trauma &amp; dissociation: the official journal of the International Society for the Study of Dissociation (ISSD)|volume=15|issue=2|pages=133–152|doi=10.1080/15299732.2014.867563|issn=1529-9740|pmid=24410254}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The military leadership in some countries has begun to acknowledge a culture of sexual misconduct in the armed forces. For example:
* The British armed forces co-commissioned their first formal study of the problem in 2006, and in 2016 the head of the [[British Army|British army]] noted the ‘overly sexualised’ soldier culture and committed to reducing the extent of sexual misconduct.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/06/14/army-has-overly-sexualised-heavy-drinking-culture-head-of-armed/|title=Army has 'overly-sexualised' heavy drinking culture, Chief of General Staff admits|last=Farmer|first=Ben|date=2016-06-14|work=The Telegraph|access-date=2018-03-08|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 2016, after a major study uncovered widespread sexual harassment and assault in the Canadian armed forces, [[Jonathan Vance|General Jonathan Vance]], Chief of the Defence Staff, acknowledged: 'Harmful sexual behaviour is a real problem in our institution.'&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/sexual-misconduct-military-survey-1.3868377|title=960 soldiers reported being sexually assaulted in the past year|last=Harris|first=Kathleen|date=2016-11-28|work=CBC News|access-date=2018-03-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The US established the Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office in 2005, which reports annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sapr.mil/index.php/about/mission-and-history|title=Mission &amp; History|last=US, Department of Defense|date=2018|website=|language=en-us|access-date=2018-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sexual harassment in the military, by country ==

=== Australia ===
Widespread reports of sexual harassment in the [[Australian Defence Force|Australian armed forces]] led to the establishment of the [[Defence Abuse Response Taskforce]] to investigate complaints from women between 1991 and 2011. It received 2,439 complaints, of which it deemed 1,751 to be plausible.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

A [[Royal Commission]] into institutional [[child sexual abuse]] was established in 2012, which investigated widespread allegations of historical abuse in the navy.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; The Commission took evidence from 8,000 individuals&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.childabuseroyalcommission.gov.au/private-sessions|title=Private sessions|last=Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse|date=2017-05-30|access-date=2018-03-09|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and reported in 2017 that many recruits of both sexes and from the age of 15 had been repeatedly sexually abused by older recruits between 1967 and 1971, including by anal [[gang rape]], and in some cases young recruits had been forced to rape each other.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; The practice was ‘tolerated’ by senior staff, according to the Commission.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/aug/22/navy-staff-tolerated-widespread-child-sexual-abuse-of-recruits-royal-commission-says|title=Navy staff tolerated widespread child sexual abuse of recruits, royal commission says|last=Australian Associated Press|date=2017-08-22|website=Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Further|Defence Abuse Response Taskforce|Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse}}

=== Canada ===
{{Main|Sexual assault in the Canadian Forces}}According to official statistics gathered by [[Maclean's|''Maclean's'' magazine]], the Canadian military police received an average of 178 complaints of sexual assault between 2000 and 2014, representing an estimated 10% of all cases.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt;

In 2014, the [[ombudsman]] of the Canadian armed forces described sexual harassment in the institution as 'a huge problem'.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt;

In 2015, after widespread allegations of sexual misconduct in the military, a major official report, the ''External Review into Sexual Misconduct and Sexual Harassment in the Canadian Armed Forces'' (the ''Deschamps Review''), was published.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; It found that sexual harassment was commonplace and embedded in military culture, and that pervasive degrading attitudes to women and LGBTQ personnel were jeopardising their safety.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The ''Deschamps Review'' also criticised the armed forces for a culture of dismissiveness.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; One male interview told the Review, for example: "Girls that come to the Army know what to expect." It stated that senior [[Non-commissioned officer|NCOs]] are frequently seen as tolerating sexual harassment and discouraging the individuals affected from making a complaint.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

The following year, in 2016, a major study of 43,000 [[Canadian Armed Forces|Canadian armed forces]] personnel reported that 27% of female personnel reported at least one incident of sexual assault since they joined the military, and 5% of female regular armed forces personnel reported the same in the previous 12 months (equivalent to approximately 960 women per year).

=== France ===
The extent of sexual harassment in the [[French Armed Forces|French armed forces]] first came to light in 2014 when 35 cases of sexual harassment and assault were detailed in ''La Guerre Invisible'', a book by Leila Minano and Julia Pascual.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/871236655|title=La guerre invisible: révélations sur les violences sexuelles dans l'armée française|last=Leila|first=Miñano|last2=Pascual|first2=Julia|publisher=Les Arènes|others=|year=2014|isbn=2352043026|location=Paris|pages=|language=fr|oclc=871236655}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the ''[[The Independent|Independent]]'' newspaper, the armed forces had not been required to report incidents or to keep statistics, and an official report acknowledged that awareness of the problem had been institutionally suppressed.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

=== United Kingdom ===
Following concerns expressed in 2004 by the UK Equal Opportunities Commission (now the [[Equality and Human Rights Commission]]) about persistent sexual harassment in the British armed forces,&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; a number of anonymised, official surveys have been undertaken. The first, in 2006, found that a male-dominated culture sexualised women and diminished their military competence.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Among the comments made to researchers by male personnel about their female counterparts were: ‘Ok there are a few exceptions but on the whole they [women] shouldn’t be here.’; 'They're all [[lesbian]]s or [[slut]]s.'; and 'They are emotionally unstable.'&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The report found that 15% of women had had a 'particularly upsetting' experience of sexual harassment in the previous 12 months; the proportion rose to 20% in the youngest age group.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; A similar survey in 2009 found the 8% of women in the army had had a ‘particularly upsetting’ experience in the previous 12 months, and the most recent survey, in 2015, found that 13% of women reported the same.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In 2017, a [[Panorama (TV series)|BBC ''Panorama'']] documentary found multiple cases of the sexual abuse of cadets from age 11 during the 1980s, and reported that the victims and their parents were discouraged from making a formal complaint or contacting the police.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; The [[Ministry of Defence]] paid £2 million in 2012 and 2013 to settle allegations of the child sexual abuse of military cadets,&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; and between 2012 and 2017 recorded a further 363 allegations, of which 282 were referred to the police.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt;

=== United States ===
{{Main|Military sexual trauma|Sexual assault in the United States military}}In 2017, the Department of Defense reported that an estimated 14,900 military personnel were sexually assaulted in 2016,&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; of whom 6,172 made an official complaint.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; According to an article published in ''[[Medscape]]'', up to 80% of women in the armed forces have been sexually harassed, and 25% have experienced a sexual assault.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/781380_3|title=Mission Critical: Getting Vets With PTSD Back to Work|last=Meade|first=Barbara J|last2=Glenn|first2=Margaret K|date=2013-03-29|website=www.medscape.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160315173801/http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/781380_3|archive-date=2016-03-15|dead-url=yes|access-date=2018-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3901">'''Stanley Williams''' (1925–1997) was a [[dance]]r and, later, a renowned [[ballet]] instructor.

==Early days==

Stanley Williams was born in [[England]] but grew up in [[Copenhagen]], and was enrolled at the Royal Danish School of Ballet.&lt;ref name="NYTObit"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C00E1D7103EF937A15753C1A961958260|title=Stanley Williams, 72, Teacher Of Top Male Ballet Dancers|last=Dunning|first=Jennifer|date=1997-10-24|publisher=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=2008-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; His instruction was steeped in the [[August Bournonville|Bournonville]] tradition, training with [[Harald Lander]], although he also studied with [[Vera Volkova]], a disciple of [[Agrippina Vaganova]]. In 1943, Williams joined the [[Royal Danish Ballet]], becoming a [[principal dancer]] six years later, and by 1950 he had begun teaching at the Royal Danish School of Ballet in [[Copenhagen]].

In the 1950s, Stanley Williams was performing as a principal dancer with [[George Krista]]'s [[Ballet Comique]] in London, where he also stood as [[balletmaster]].

By 1964, Williams's reputation had reached [[George Balanchine]], who invited him to instruct at the [[School of American Ballet]] in [[New York City]].&lt;ref name="NYTObit"/&gt;

==New York==
From 1964 until his death in 1997, Stanley Williams was first among instructors at the [[School of American Ballet]]. 
As a teacher, he was soft-spoken. {{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

His original teaching style relied a lot on exercises to develop speed, foot work and petit allegro (small jumps), in the tradition of the [[Bournonville]] and [[Balanchine]] [[ballet]] styles. Williams contrasted slow movement with sudden, almost spastic moves, and spoke in vague terms that some students found hard to understand. One of his famous phrases was "You're going out, you have to go in," which he constantly repeated to correct many different types of movements and steps without being too specific.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

Williams often stressed his dislike of certain features of the [[Russian ballet]] style, which in his opinion, lacked the movement flow, continuity and contrast he was seeking.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

He smoked a pipe&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Barnes|first=Clive|date=Jan 1998|title=Stanley Williams, magisterial teacher - ballet teacher|journal=Dance Magazine|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1083/is_n1_v72/ai_20183153/pg_1?tag=artBody;col1|accessdate=2008-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was the only person allowed to smoke in the Rose building, where [[School of American Ballet|SAB]] and [[NYCB]] are situated. He apparently accepted the job as a teacher on the condition that he be allowed to smoke in the building. The smell of his pipe, which often pervaded the SAB corridors, became associated with him and SAB.

In 1992 he was awarded the Mae L. Wien Award of [[US Dollar|$]]10,000 by the [[School of American Ballet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE2D8123FF93BA35755C0A964958260|last=Brozan|first=Nadine|date=1992-06-08|title=Chronicle|publisher=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=2008-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Institute for Language and Folklore''', ({{lang-sv|Institutet för språk och folkminnen}}, but commonly referred to by the [[acronym]] '''SOFI'''), is a [[Government agencies in Sweden|Swedish government agency]] with the purpose of studying and collecting materials concerning dialects, folklore and [[onomastics]].

In June 2006 the Swedish government decided to centralize the Swedish language preservation institutes, starting on the July 1, 2006. The former name, Swedish Institute for Dialectology, Onomastics and Folklore Research ({{lang-sv|Språk- och folkminnesinstituet}}) was changed to the current name.

The institute consists of several, originally independent, units, located in different Swedish university towns. The central unit of the institute is located in [[Uppsala]], with other departments located to [[Lund]], [[Gothenburg]], [[Umeå]] and [[Stockholm]].

The institute is, among other things, responsible for the ongoing publication of ''Sveriges ortnamn'' (a dictionary of all Swedish placenames) and ''Sveriges medeltida personnamn'' (a dictionary of medieval Swedish personal names).

'''Talis Group Ltd.''' is a software company based in [[Birmingham]], England that develops software for Higher Education. They were previously involved in development of library management software and a [[Semantic Web]] application platform. In 2005 Talis was voted one of the top [[Information and Communications Technology|ICT]] Employers in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.computingcareers.co.uk/top-it-employers/talis| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070306060612/http://www.computingcareers.co.uk/top-it-employers/talis| dead-url=yes| archive-date=2007-03-06| title=Computing Careers| accessdate=2008-03-13| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

In 1969 a number of libraries founded a small co-operative project, based in Birmingham, to provide services that would help the libraries become more efficient. The project was known as the Birmingham Libraries Co-operative Mechanisation Project, or BLCMP, and included the library of the [[University of Birmingham]]. At this time the concept of [[library automation]] was so new that the term ''mechanisation'' was often used in its place.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

BLCMP began a co-operative catalogue of bibliographic data at the start of its work, a database that now contains many millions of records. For this an adaptation of UKMARC coding was used. This shared approach to creating metadata is the forefather of later, Internet-based, community ventures such as [[Internet Movie Database|IMDb]], [[Freebase (database)|Freebase]] and others. But this was back in 1969 when shipping this data around involved printing cards and putting boxes on trucks. More libraries became members of BLCMP, e.g. many of the academic libraries of Manchester and [[Salford, Greater Manchester|Salford]].

BLCMP moved into using microfiche and later [[IBM]] mainframes with dedicated terminals at libraries in the mid-seventies and was one of the first library automation vendors to provide a [[GUI]] on top of [[Microsoft Windows]] to provide a better interface for end-users. The [[integrated library system]] (ILS) was first called Talis after 'The Automated Library And Information System'.  Talis became the name of the company during re-structuring&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | year = 1999 | title = BLCMP to Become Talis Information Ltd. | journal = Library Systems | volume = 19 | issue = 1 | pages = 4 | issn = 0277-0288 | oclc = 94137446}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the ILS became known as Alto. In 1995 Talis was the first library systems vendor to produce a web-enabled public access catalogue.

During the first decade of the 3rd millennium, much of Talis's work focused on the transition of information to the web, specifically the [[Semantic Web]], and Talis has led much of the debate about how [[Web 2.0]] attitudes affect traditional libraries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Miller | first = Paul |date=October 2005 | title = Web 2.0: Building the New Library | journal = Ariadne | issue = 19 | url = http://www.ariadne.ac.uk/issue45/miller/ | accessdate = 2008-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alongside semantic web developments Talis launched Talis Education Ltd, a business focused on products in Higher Education learning, and Kasabi, a data marketplace.

In March 2011 Talis sold its library management division to [[Capita Group]].  The division was sold for a reported £18.5 million plus a further £2.5 million depending on the company’s profitability in the following financial year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.information-age.com/channels/information-management/news/1607743/capita-acquires-uk-semantic-web-trailblazer-talis.thtml]&lt;/ref&gt;  The company moved its headquarters from [[Solihull]] to central [[Birmingham]].

Following the sale of its library management business Talis experimented with a semantic web and data marketplace business alongside the rapidly establishing education business. A tough economic climate required Talis to focus its investment, therefore they announced in July 2012 that investment in the semantic web and data marketplace areas would cease. All efforts are now concentrated on the education business.

Talis Aspire, the company's enterprise teaching and learning platform, is now in use by over 1 million students at 93 universities across 8 countries, including over 65% of all UK universities.

Talis was acquired by [[SAGE Publications]] in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=SAGE buys technology company Talis |first=Benedicte |last=Page |url= https://www.thebookseller.com/news/sage-buys-technology-company-talis-847456 |newspaper=The Bookseller |date=16 August 2018 |accessdate=17 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Quantum Vacuum: An Introduction to Quantum Electrodynamics''''' is a [[physics]] [[textbook]] authored by [[Peter W. Milonni]] in 1993. The book provides a careful and thorough treatment of [[zero-point energy]], [[spontaneous emission]], the [[Casimir Force|Casimir]], [[van der Waals forces]], [[Lamb shift]] and [[Electron magnetic moment|anomalous magnetic moment of the electron]] at a level of detail not found in other introductory texts to [[quantum electrodynamics]].

The first chapter, ''Zero‐Point Energy in Early Quantum Theory'', was originally published in 1991 in the ''[[American Journal of Physics]]''.

In 2008 Milonni received the [[Max Born Award]] "For exceptional contributions to the fields of theoretical optics, laser physics and quantum mechanics, and for dissemination of scientific knowledge through authorship of a series of outstanding books".

A '''University College Entrance Program''' (UCEP) is an education program in Canada, designed for adults who were unable to successfully complete [[Grade 12]] level [[Course (education)|course]]s, but wish to go into a [[Higher education|post secondary education]]. Many schools offer such a program, which allows a student to gain the necessary prerequisite courses.

UCEP programs helps students get the [[matriculation|matriculation courses]] they need to go on to [[college]] and [[university]] study, giving them the skills, experience and knowledge that are essential for post-secondary success. Students may also enjoy [[field trip]]s, [[theater|theatre productions]], and exposure to different area colleges and universities to become familiar with post-secondary education. 

Similarly, UCEP students may receive individualized counseling support to help them work through any barriers to reaching their academic potential. Often, this means overcoming obstacles that prevented these individuals from completing their Grade 12 level courses in the first place.

'''Workbooks''' in the American education system are [[paperback]] [[textbooks]] issued to students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| accessdate = 2011-05-16
| location = http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/workbook
| publisher = Merriam-Webster Dictionary
| title = workbook
| quote = 4. a student's book of problems to be solved directly on the pages

| accessdate = 2011-05-16
| location = http://oxforddictionaries.com/
| publisher = Oxford dictionaries
| title = workbook
| quote = a student's book containing instruction and exercises relating to a particular subject.
| url = http://oxforddictionaries.com/view/entry/m_en_gb0959950#m_en_gb0959950}}&lt;/ref&gt; Workbooks are usually filled with practice problems, where the answers can be written directly in the book.

==Advantages==
Workbooks are often used in schools for younger students, either in [[middle school]] or [[elementary school]]. They are favored because students can work directly in their books, eliminating the need for [[looseleaf]] and copying questions from a textbook. In industry, they may be customized interactive manuals which are used to help provide structure to an otherwise [[Complexity|complex]] problem.

Workbooks also hold an advantage because they are usually smaller and lighter than textbooks, which equates to less trouble when the student brings the book home to complete their [[homework]].

The term workbook is also used to describe other compilations of questions that require the reader to complete [[scratch-work]] when dealing with higher-level mathematics. It can also be used as a training tool for certain job positions.

More recently, electronic workbooks have permitted interactive and customized learning. Such workbooks may be used on computers, laptops, PDAs, and may be web-based.
