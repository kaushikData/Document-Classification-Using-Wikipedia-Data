'''''Australia's Naughtiest Home Videos''''' is an Australian television comedy programme which was broadcast on [[Nine Network]] on 4 September 1992. It was a one-off special spin-off of ''[[Australia's Funniest Home Video Show]]'', depicting videos of sexual situations and other sexually explicit content. The programme was notably taken off the air partway through the broadcast of its [[List of television series canceled after one episode|first and only episode]] on the order of network owner [[Kerry Packer]].

== Background ==
''Australia's Funniest Home Video Show'' premiered in 1990, and was similar in concept to the 1989 American special (and later series) ''[[America's Funniest Home Videos]]:'' viewers would send in amateur-shot videos that were unintentionally humorous, and the video deemed the "funniest" by the studio audience was awarded a prize at the end of the show. 

The [[Television producer|producers]] often received racy or risqu√© videos that couldn't be included into the programme due to its family-friendly nature, and since the show's policy stated that videos sent in by viewers couldn't be sent back, videos that didn't make it to the program were still kept by the [[Television station|station]].&lt;ref name="aus1"&gt;{{cite news|last=Casey|first=Marcus|title=The moment Kerry Packer blew his stack |url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/the-moment-kerry-packer-blew-his-stack/story-e6frf0a0-1111117239870|accessdate=30 December 2010|publisher=The Daily Telegraph|date=20 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The producers decided to compile these videos into a one-off special aimed at an adult audience.

It differed from ''Australia's Funniest Home Video Show'' in more than just the content of the videos. It had a different opening, a modified version of the ''Australia's Funniest Home Video Show'''s theme song, and a slightly modified set. It was hosted by Australian radio personality [[Doug Mulray]]. Due to the difference in content, the show aired at 8:30&amp;nbsp;PM&lt;ref name="aus1" /&gt; and was preceded by a short message warning viewers of the show's content, and informing them that it was a one-off special that was different from ''Australia's Funniest Home Video Show''.

== Content ==
[[File:Naughtyvideosscreenshot.png|thumb|A child grabbing a [[kangaroo's scrotum]] in one of the videos featured in the special.]]
The show followed the same structure of ''Australia's Funniest Home Video Show'', in which the videos were shown in short blocks, interspersed with humorous monologues written and delivered by Mulray.&lt;ref name="aus2" /&gt; Mulray often poked fun at the content of the videos, which he described as "The most sensational collection of home videos since [[Rodney King#Incident|Rodney King nicked out for a pizza recently]]." Mulray also did humorous voice overs as the videos were shown, similar to Lisa Patrick's on ''Australia's Funniest Home Video Show''.

The content of the videos included shots of animal [[genitalia]], humans or animals humorously engaging in [[sexual intercourse]], people who get accidentally and humorously [[disrobe]]d, and other situations that often relied on [[Ribaldry|ribald]] humour, including a child grabbing a [[kangaroo]]'s testicles, a man lifting a [[barbell]] with his penis, a man getting his head squeezed between an [[Exotic dancer|erotic dancer]]'s large breasts, an elderly woman removing an envelope from a stripper's undergarments with her [[dentures]], two people running into water with flaming pieces of [[toilet paper]] hanging from their [[buttocks]], and two people filmed having sex in the middle of a park.

== Cancellation ==

{{quote box |width=30em | bgcolor=transparent |align=left|quote=We apologise for this interruption. Unfortunately, a technical problem prevents us continuing our scheduled programme for the moment. In the meantime, we bring you a brief, alternative programme.|salign=right |source=‚ÄîAn announcement made after the show was pulled and just before a rerun of ''Cheers'' aired.}}

[[Kerry Packer]], the owner of the [[Nine Network]] at the time, was informed of the show's content by friends while having dinner. He tuned in to watch the show, which was being transmitted on [[TCN]]-9, and was so offended by its content that he phoned the studio operators and angrily shouted, "Get that shit off the air!" 

Within minutes, [[List of television series canceled after one episode|the series was pulled]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://bulletin.ninemsn.com.au/article.aspx?id=141718|title=Worst of TV|accessdate =14 November 2007|publisher=NineMSN|work=The Bulletin |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080110130901/http://bulletin.ninemsn.com.au/article.aspx?id=141718 |archivedate=10 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the break, the Nine Network announced that it failed to continue airing the show, purportedly due to technical difficulties, and aired reruns of the American sitcom ''[[Cheers]]'' immediately afterwards to fill in the remaining airtime. In 2008, Bert Newton justified the broadcast explanation: "It's ''technically'' very ''difficult'' to keep a show on air with Mr. Packer on the phone, yelling at you."{{cn|date=September 2018}}

Although the same bumper and announcement interrupted the show during every broadcast across Australia, it occurred in different parts of the programme depending on the area it was airing in, due to time differences: In the eastern states, the station simply started airing an episode of ''Cheers'' after a scheduled commercial break, but in other areas, the last part of the show broadcast was of Mulray giving a monologue about "[[bosoms]]" or the aforementioned clip of a child grabbing a kangaroo's scrotum. The show was cancelled before it was scheduled to air in [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]], and thus its Nine Network affiliate showed a brief message mentioning that the special wouldn't be aired before beginning an episode of ''Cheers''.

Despite Packer's objections to the series' content, it was popular among viewers. The special was recorded to a record studio audience. After the announcement, Nine reportedly received "thousands" of phone calls from viewers, with 65 percent of callers upset with the programme being pulled,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ebroadcast.com.au/enews/nine/AUSTRALIA-S-NAUGHTIEST-HOME-VIDEOS---THURSDAY-AUGUST-28-AT-8-30PM-ON-NINE-200808.html|title=Nine Press Release|accessdate=20 August 2008|publisher=eBroadcast|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080823070329/http://www.ebroadcast.com.au/enews/nine/AUSTRALIA-S-NAUGHTIEST-HOME-VIDEOS---THURSDAY-AUGUST-28-AT-8-30PM-ON-NINE-200808.html|archivedate=23 August 2008|deadurl=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; in contrast to the 60 callers who called in during the show's broadcast, complaining about the show.&lt;ref name="aus2" /&gt; Viewers were generally bewildered by the sudden interruption and the cut to ''Cheers'', not knowing about the show's cancellation until it was widely reported by the Australian media outlets the next day.&lt;ref name="aus2" /&gt;

The day after the special aired, a furious Packer showed up at Nine's headquarters and held meetings in which he loudly berated Nine's managers and censors, referring to the program as "disgusting and offensive shit." After these meetings, Mulray and many of the staff who were involved with the creation of the special were fired, with Mulray being banned for life from Channel Nine. 

On his radio show the next day, Mulray commented, "I am the first man in Australian history to be pulled off by Kerry Packer."&lt;ref name="aus1" /&gt; 

Mulray returned to Nine to be a judge on the 2005 series ''[[StarStruck (2005 TV series)|StarStruck]]'' shortly after Packer's death on December 26 of that year.

In 2008, a full copy of the show was located by Nine's head of factual television. 

It was aired in its entirety at 8:30&amp;nbsp;PM on 28 August 2008, one week short of sixteen years after the original special, and at the same time. Promoted as "the show Kerry Packer didn't want you to see", it featured commentary from [[Bert Newton]]; Packer had died in December 2005, and Mulray refused Nine's request to host the special.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|date=30 August 2008 |url=http://www.news.com.au/dailytelegraph/story/0,22049,24261915-5001030,00.html |title=Kerry wouldn't have aired 's&amp;#t' |accessdate=31 August 2008 |publisher=[[News Limited]] |work=[[The Daily Telegraph (Sydney)|The Daily Telegraph]] |first=Mal |last=Holland |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080918094914/http://www.news.com.au/dailytelegraph/story/0%2C22049%2C24261915-5001030%2C00.html |archivedate=18 September 2008 |deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The special was interrupted by the Channel Nine bumper and "technical difficulties" announcement 36 minutes in, cutting to the ''Cheers'' opening credits before resuming to a monologue by Newton, and the latter part of the special that never aired. The re-airing was censored, with portions of Mulray's monologues (including jibes about "fat kids") being cut from the special as they were deemed to be "no longer acceptable".&lt;ref name="aus2" /&gt;

'''''Candle Cove''''' is a [[creepypasta]] online horror story written by webcartoonist and author [[Kris Straub]] in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PP_OCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT636&amp;dq=%22Candle+Cove%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjo5YWM1bbOAhVS9GMKHQliCUEQ6AEIJjAC#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Candle%20Cove%22&amp;f=false|title=The Ashgate Research Companion to Paranormal Cultures|last=Jenzen|first=Olu|date=2016-03-23|publisher=Routledge|year=|isbn=9781317042181|location=|pages=|language=en|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The story centers on a fictional television series, also titled &lt;em&gt;Candle Cove&lt;/em&gt;, that could only be viewed by a small group of people, predominantly children, who later recall the disturbing show on a web forum.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.crushable.com/2011/06/25/entertainment/creepy-things-that-seem-real-but-arent-candle-cove/|title=Creepy Things That Seem Real But Aren‚Äôt: Candle Cove|last=Peters|first=Lucia|date=|website=Crushable|publisher=|access-date=2016-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Straub has stated that he was inspired to write the creepypasta after reading "Area 36-Year-Old Still Has Occasional ''[[Lidsville]]'' Nightmare", an article published via the satirical news outlet ''[[The Onion]]''.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.blumhouse.com/2016/08/25/creepypasta-revisiting-candle-cove-the-scariest-childrens-show-of-all-time/|title=CREEPYPASTA: Revisiting CANDLE COVE ‚Äî The Scariest Children‚Äôs Show of All Time?|last=Burkart|first=Gregory|date=2016-08-25|website=Blumhouse.com|access-date=2016-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Straub's story quickly became popular, inspiring numerous [[YouTube]] videos, and fan-fictions.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/do-you-remember-candle-cove|title=Do You Remember Candle Cove?|last=Grundhauser|first=Eric|date=2016-10-07|work=|newspaper=Atlas Obscura|access-date=2016-10-19|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015 Straub self-published ''Candle Cove'' in a collection of short stories entitled ''Candle Cove and Other Stories''. [[The Verge]] commented that ''Candle Cove'' differed from other creepypastas in that while most creepypasta have an "anonymous folkloric quality", ''Candle Cove''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'s originated from a known source and author.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2015/7/1/8879963/syfy-channel-zero-candle-cove-max-landis|title=SyFy is making a TV series based on one of the internet's best scary stories|last=Robertson|first=Adi|date=2015-07-01|website=The Verge|access-date=2016-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A television adaptation, ''[[Channel Zero: Candle Cove]]'', premiered on [[Syfy]] on October 11, 2016.

==Synopsis==
The story is told via a thread on a forum called the "NetNostalgia Forums", where a group of users discuss an unusual  television show, ''Candle Cove''. The show is about a young girl named Janice, who imagines herself to be friends with pirates. The pirate characters are said to be portrayed by puppets. 

As the users continue to reminisce they begin to recall more disturbing details about the show, such as a character known as the "Skin-Taker", a skeleton pirate who wears clothing made out of children's skin, and an episode that consisted entirely of the puppets flailing and screaming. The story closes with a user stating that they had recently visited their mother, who revealed that during the times the user said they were watching ''Candle Cove'', all the mother saw on the TV was [[Noise (video)|static]].

==Television adaptation==
{{Main article|Channel Zero (TV series)}}

In 2015 the [[Syfy|SyFy Channel]] announced their intent to adapt the ''Candle Cove'' story as the first season of a newly announced series, ''Channel Zero''.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deadline.com/2015/11/channel-zero-syfy-series-greenlight-candle-cove-1201628879/|title=‚ÄòChannel Zero‚Äô Anthology Series Gets Greenlight From Syfy For 2-Season Run|website=Deadline.com|last1=Hipes|first1=Patrick|accessdate=28 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The season, named after the creepypasta, expands on the story and centers on a child psychologist who has returned home in order to investigate the 1980s disappearances of his brother and other children.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/syfy-prepping-anthology-based-web-806074|title=Syfy Prepping Anthology Based on Web Horror Phenomenon 'Creepypasta'|last=Goldberg|first=Leslie|date=June 30, 2015|website=The Hollywood Reporter|publisher=|access-date=2016-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Channel Zero: Candle Cove'' stars [[Paul Schneider (actor)|Paul Schneider]] and [[Fiona Shaw]], and premiered on October 11, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/article/2016/08/03/syfy-incorporated-z-nation-premiere-dates|title=Syfy sets premiere dates for 'Incorporated,' 'Van Helsing,' more|last=Abrams|first=Natalie|date=August 3, 2016|website=Entertainment Weekly|publisher=|access-date=2016-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
Will Wiles of ''[[Aeon (digital magazine)|Aeon]]'' wrote that ''Candle Cove'' was "among the best creepypastas out there" and a good example of using the messageboard and forum format as a storytelling tactic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://aeon.co/essays/creepypasta-is-how-the-internet-learns-our-fears|title=‚ÄòCreepypasta‚Äô is how the internet learns our fears|last=Wiles|first=Will|date=|website=Aeon|publisher=|access-date=2016-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://io9.gizmodo.com/is-creepypasta-a-form-of-folklore-1495902436|title=Has Creepypasta Reinvented Classic Folklore?|last=Newitz|first=Annalee|date=|website=io9|publisher=|language=en-US|access-date=2016-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Verge has written praise for the creepypasta, stating that it was "a perfectly dark spin on our nostalgia for the half-remembered stories of our childhood, that realization that the things we liked as kids were much, much creepier than we thought."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The '''Congress of the People (COPE)''' is a South African political party formed in 2008 by former members of the [[African National Congress]] (ANC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7784763.stm|publisher=BBC News|title=New party to challenge ANC rule|date=16 December 2008|accessdate=21 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The party was founded by former ANC members [[Mosiuoa Lekota]], [[Mbhazima Shilowa]] and [[Mluleki George]] to contest the [[South African general election, 2009|2009 general election]]. The party was announced following a national convention held in [[Sandton]] on 1 November 2008, and was founded at a congress held in [[Bloemfontein]] on 16 December 2008. The name echoes the 1955 [[Congress of the People (1955)|Congress of the People]] at which the [[Freedom Charter]] was adopted by the ANC and other parties, a name strongly contested by the ANC in a legal move dismissed by the [[Pretoria]] High Court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thetimes.co.za/News/Article.aspx?id=904235|title=Cope wins name battle|work=The Times|location=UK|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081221011535/http://www.thetimes.co.za/News/Article.aspx?id=904235|archivedate=21 December 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2009 general election, the party received 1,311,027 votes and a 7.42% share of the vote. Following the 2009 elections, COPE experienced a leadership dispute between factions supporting Mosiuoa Lekota and others supporting Mbhazima Shilowa,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sowetanlive.co.za/news/2011/05/13/infighting-necessary---cope|title='Infighting necessary' - Cope|date=13 May 2011|website=www.sowetanlive.co.za}}&lt;/ref&gt; that led to a 2013 court battle,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.iol.co.za/news/shilowa-row-goes-back-to-court-1598059|title=Shilowa row goes back to court|publisher=IOL News|author=Shanti Aboobaker|date=27 October 2013|accessdate=21 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and continued into 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bdlive.co.za/national/politics/2014/01/07/cope-factions-headed-for-court-battle|author=Khulekani Magubane|title=COPE factions headed for court battle|website=www.bdlive.co.za|date=7 January 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140114000244/http://www.bdlive.co.za/national/politics/2014/01/07/cope-factions-headed-for-court-battle|archivedate=14 January 2014|deadurl=yes|accessdate=7 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[South African general election, 2014|2014 election]], COPE was left with only three seats in the National Assembly, down from 30 seats in 2009.&lt;ref name=bdlive&gt;{{cite web|title=Only COPE has lost more seats than ANC|publisher=BDlive|url=http://www.bdlive.co.za/national/politics/2014/05/09/only-cope-has-lost-more-seats-than-anc|date=9 May 2014|accessdate=11 May 2014|deadurl=yes|archivedate=11 May 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140511030029/http://www.bdlive.co.za/national/politics/2014/05/09/only-cope-has-lost-more-seats-than-anc}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite its reduced stature, the party has joined with the much larger [[Democratic Alliance (South Africa)|Democratic Alliance]] (DA) and several other smaller parties to co-govern [[Nelson Mandela Bay Metropolitan Municipality|Nelson Mandela Bay]], [[City of Johannesburg Metropolitan Municipality|Johannesburg]] and [[City of Tshwane Metropolitan Municipality|Tshwane]] after the 2016 municipal elections. 

==History==

===52nd ANC national conference===
{{Main|52nd National Conference of the African National Congress}}
The birth of the party can be traced back to the 52nd ANC national conference held at Polokwane in December 2007. The conference resulted in the election of [[Jacob Zuma]] and his supporters, ahead of [[Thabo Mbeki]] and his supporters, to the ANC's governing body, the [[National Executive Committee]]. Zuma was elected ANC president ahead of Mbeki. The conference highlighted the different factions within the ANC and brought to the fore the diametrically opposed philosophies between Mbeki and Zuma. This included differences in both style and economic policy ‚Äì the former pursued [[neoliberal]] economic policies and was known for an aloof personality and plotting against his political opponents,&lt;ref name=burn&gt;{{cite news|title=Hundreds burn ANC cards in Paarl|author=Lynnette Johns|url=https://www.iol.co.za/news/politics/hundreds-burn-anc-cards-in-paarl-421807|publisher=Independent Online (IOL)|date=26 October 2008|accessdate=21 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; while his successor is more left-wing and populist, and has a closer relationship with the [[South African Communist Party]] and [[Congress of South African Trade Unions]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Plaut, Martin|accessdate=21 November 2018|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7627882.stm|publisher=BBC News|title=Why Mbeki had to go|date=21 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The split also revealed underlying ethnic tensions between [[Zulu language|Zulu]] and [[Xhosa language|Xhosa]] speakers, represented by Jacob Zuma and Thabo Mbeki respectively, as they jostled for political predominance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Plaut, Martin|accessdate=21 November 2018|title=S Africa's ANC on brink of split|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7695492.stm|publisher=BBC News|date=31 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Zuma corruption trial and recall of Mbeki===
Jacob Zuma, now elected president of the ANC and ANC candidate for President in the South Africa at the 2009 election, was facing corruption charges in relation to a [[South African Arms Deal|multi-billion rand arms deal]] with French manufacturer [[Thint]]. Zuma had previously been dismissed by Mbeki as South Africa's vice-president at the start of the arms deal trial.

In 2008 a landmark ruling by high court judge [[Christopher Robert Nicholson|Chris Nicholson]] found that the re-charging of Zuma by the [[National Prosecuting Authority]] was illegal and was unduly influenced by Mbeki due to political motives. The case against Zuma was thus dismissed. As a consequence of the judge's findings of political interference, the ANC's National Executive Committee requested the recall of Mbeki as the country's president. Mbeki tendered his resignation on 21 September 2008 and the resignation became official on 25 September. Many members of Mbeki's cabinet resigned their posts at the same time in solidarity, including vice-president [[Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka]] and other senior cabinet ministers.

The recall of Mbeki brought to the fore simmering tensions within the ANC. On 23 September Mosiuoa Lekota announced that he had served the ANC with "divorce papers" and on 8 October announced that a national convention would be held to discuss the future of South African politics and the possible formation of a new political movement.

Lekota's call resounded with many Mbeki supporters who started handing in their resignations to the ANC to join Lekota's movement. Notable resignations include those of former [[Gauteng]] premier [[Mbhazima Shilowa]], former [[Western Cape]] minister of safety and security [[Leonard Ramatlakane]] and [[Mluleki George]]. Across the country many regular ANC members also handed in their resignations in public demonstrations, burning their ANC membership cards.&lt;ref name=burn/&gt; The resignation movement resounded particularly in provinces in which there were already splits in the ANC structure, such as the [[Western Cape]].

===Convention and formation of new party===
The convention called by Lekota was held in [[Sandton]] on 1 November 2008. Planned for 4,000 delegates over two days, the conference eventually hosted over 5,000, with some people not able to get into the venue, and was shortened to one day to avoid inconvenience to those delegates who had nowhere to stay overnight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.iol.co.za/news/politics/shikota-convention-oversubscribed-422704|title='Shikota' convention oversubscribed|publisher=IOL News|date=1 November 2008|accessdate=21 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The conference was attended by major political figures, including delegates from other political parties. The ANC did not send a delegation to the conference.

Following the conference Lekota announced that a new party would be formed on 16 December. In Western Cape municipal by-elections on 11 December 2008, COPE won 10 of 27 wards (with its candidates running as independents, as it was not yet registered); the ANC won only three wards, with twelve of its candidates disqualified due to missing the registration deadline. The DA won nine seats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7777998.stm|publisher=BBC News|title=ANC breakaway scores poll upset|date=11 December 2008|accessdate=21 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The party was formally launched at a three-day conference from 14 to 16 December 2008,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/12/16/AR2008121600130.html?wprss=rss_world|title=New Party Formally Launched in South Africa|work=The Washington Post}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; at which Lekota was named president.

The president and provincial premiers and mayors (after municipal elections) are subsequently elected by the members of the relevant assembly.

On 20 February 2009, they announced clergyman [[Mvume Dandala]] as their presidential candidate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://mg.co.za/article/2009-02-20-bishop-elbows-aside-lekota-shilowa|title=Bishop elbows aside Lekota, Shilowa|work=[[Mail &amp; Guardian]]|author1=Mandy Rossouw|author2=Mmanaledi Mataboge|date=20 February 2009|accessdate=21 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A COPE official was murdered in the Eastern Cape,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.canberratimes.com.au/news/world/world/general/politician-killed-as-south-africans-vote/1495225.aspx|title=Politician killed as South Africans vote|work=Canberra Times|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091014090009/http://www.canberratimes.com.au/news/world/world/general/politician-killed-as-south-africans-vote/1495225.aspx|archivedate=14 October 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and COPE supporters, from the Eastern Cape, were driven out of their shacks in Durban.&lt;ref&gt;[http://reconciliationbarometer.org/?page_id=2884 Political tolerance on the wane in South Africa], Imraan Buccus, University of KwaZulu-Natal, ''SA Reconciliation Barometer''. Retrieved 21 November 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; The party achieved the leadership of the opposition in the legislatures of Eastern Cape, Free State, Limpopo and Northern Cape and representation in all nine provinces.

==Reactions==

===Reaction from the ANC and alliance partners===
The ANC leadership reacted by offering a reconciliation meeting between treasurer [[Mathews Phosa]] and Lekota and his former deputy defense minister Mluleki George on 13 October. However, the meeting ended without resolution. On 14 October, Lekota and George were suspended from membership in the ANC by the [[National Executive Committee (African National Congress)|National Executive Committee]], with threats of suspension against any other members who sought to join Lekota and George. Both Zuma and then [[ANC Youth League]] president [[Julius Malema]] ridiculed Lekota for the announcement.&lt;!-- The [[South African Communist Party]] and its Young Communist League also ridiculed Lekota and George, referring to them as "right-wing beasts".&lt;ref&gt;SA National Convention http://www.sanationalconvention.com/27.html&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt;

===Support from within the ANC===
On 15 October, former [[Gauteng]] premier [[Mbhazima Shilowa]], who resigned from his position soon after Mbeki and the cabinet resigned, announced that he had resigned his membership from the ANC and thrown his support behind Lekota's convention, which he announced would be held on 2 November.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7671292.stm|title=ANC heavyweight joins rebellion|publisher=BBC News|date=15 October 2008|accessdate=21 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The partnership between Lekota and Shilowa led the press to nickname the proposed new party "Shikota". Former Western Cape community safety minister [[Leonard Ramatlakane]] resigned from the ANC on 22 October to join Lekota's initiative. On 3 November, former Eastern Cape premier [[Nosimo Balindlela]] announced her resignation from the ANC in order to join the proposed new party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/Politics/Balindlela-resigns-from-ANC-20081103|title=Balindlela resigns from ANC|publisher=News24|date=3 November 2008|accessdate=21 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 13 November 2008, [[Smuts Ngonyama]], the former head of communications for ANC, joined the breakaway movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7727278.stm|publisher=BBC News|title=S Africa's ANC loses top official|date=13 November 2008|accessdate=21 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reaction from other parties===
[[Helen Zille]] of the [[Democratic Alliance (South Africa)|Democratic Alliance]], [[Bantu Holomisa]] of the [[United Democratic Movement]] and [[Mangosuthu Buthelezi]] of the [[Inkatha Freedom Party]] all welcomed the announcement, saying that a new party in opposition to the ANC would diversify the political landscape and pull South Africa from being an effectively [[dominant-party system]].

==Prominent supporters==
COPE has attracted the support of a wide range of well-known South Africans from various sectors, including Sipho Ngwema, former head of communications for the [[Scorpions (South Africa)|Scorpions]] who is now the party's media liaison chief,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Fiona Forde|url=https://www.iol.co.za/news/politics/ex-scorpion-bigwig-joins-cope-info-team-427415|title=Ex-Scorpion bigwig joins COPE info team|publisher=Independent Online|date=1 December 2008|accessdate=21 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and cleric [[Allan Boesak]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.iol.co.za/news/politics/boesak-joins-cope-429091|title=Boesak joins COPE|publisher=Independent Online|date=16 December 2008|accessdate=21 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; who ran in the 2009 election as COPE's Western Cape premier candidate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.iol.co.za/news/politics/boesak-for-western-cape-premier-429173|author=Gaye Davis|author2=Andisiwe Makinana|title=Boesak for Western Cape premier?|publisher=Independent Online|date=17 December 2008|accessdate=21 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other prominent supporters include the wife of [[Vusi Pikoli]], the former head of the National Prosecuting Authority, and [[Simon Grindrod]], former deputy president of the [[Independent Democrats]].

[[Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka]], former deputy president under [[Thabo Mbeki]], and [[Saki Macozoma]], a prominent South African billionnaire and close ally of Mbeki, joined COPE in late February 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.mg.co.za/article/2009-03-01-phumzile-macozoma-throw-lot-in-with-cope|title=Phumzile, Macozoma defect to Cope|work=Mail &amp; Guardian|date=1 March 2009|accessdate=21 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Macozoma's affiliation to the party was accidentally leaked by Mbhazima Shilowa himself in London, United Kingdom, in the third week of January 2009&lt;ref&gt;[http://152.111.1.87/argief/berigte/dieburger/2009/01/22/SK/13/vryburger22jan.html Onkundige kundiges en kansvatters ‚Äì Media24 Archive] (in Afrikaans) ''Die Burger''. 22 January 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Mlambo-Ngcuka who is best known for her statement that South Africa could learn from Zimbabwe with regard to land reform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://mg.co.za/article/2005-08-10-land-reform-sa-should-learn-from-zimbabwe|title=Land reform: SA should 'learn from Zimbabwe'|work=Mail &amp; Guardian|date=10 August 2005|accessdate=21 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Policy==
In an interview with ''The Sunday Times'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/mosiuoa-terror-lekota-threatens-to-topple-the-anc-wmt7ttt3fgz|title=Mosiuoa 'Terror' Lekota threatens to topple the ANC|author=RW Johnson|work=The Sunday Times|location=London|date=19 October 2008|accessdate=21 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lekota stated that the ideology of the party will be one that embraces multiracial and multicultural participation in governance, promoting of the free market and disavowed themselves from any connection to [[Marxism]]. He has also indicated that the party would be willing to ally itself with the Democratic Alliance, a historically liberal party, in the case that the DA ever enters government.

According to the party's manifesto flyer,&lt;ref name="party manifesto"&gt;http://www.copewebsite.co.za/documents/cope_manifesto.pdf {{Dead link|date=July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; COPE's campaign topics for the 2009 elections are maintaining the constitutional status quo, unemployment, job satisfaction, poverty, the environment, secondary and tertiary education, health care in general, crime, women empowerment, youth development, family values, and future [[non-racialism]].

A main distinction between COPE and the ruling ANC party is that COPE favours a system in which top-level government officials are elected directly, by public election, and officials can be removed only by courts of justice, whereas the current situation in South Africa is that top-level government officials are appointed and can be removed from office by the political parties themselves.&lt;ref name="party manifesto"/&gt;

==Controversies==

===Party name===
Before settling on the name ''Congress of the People'' and the abbreviation ''COPE'', several possible names were used or suggested by the party founders themselves and through speculation in the media.

During a public meeting on 12 October 2008 in Langa, where Lekota was the speaker, membership forms for a possible new party, bearing the name ''African National Congress of South Africa (ANCSA)'', were distributed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://152.111.1.87/argief/berigte/dieburger/2008/10/13/KS/5/sslekota.html ANC-afstigters maak stem dik, kry naam, organiseer ‚Äì Media24 Archive] (in Afrikaans) ''Die Burger'' {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110529061959/http://152.111.1.87/argief/berigte/dieburger/2008/10/13/KS/5/sslekota.html |date=29 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 31 October 2008, one day prior to the new party's convention in Sandton, the ANC made an urgent application to the high court to prevent the new party from using names such as ''South Africa National Convention'', ''South Africa National Congress'', ''SANC'' or any other name or trademark that is similar to its own.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://stage.dieburger.com/Stories/News/18.0.1035528913.aspx|title=Nasionale konvensie vandag: Dis ANC teen (S)ANC|work=Die Burger|author=Verslagspan Pretoria|language=Afrikaans|date=31 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The judge ruled that the convention may go ahead, but did make a ruling on the names issue until 6 November.&lt;ref name="nov-15-2008"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jv.dieburger.com//Stories/Opinion/18.0.1077588798.aspx|title=As partye naam wil maak|work=Die Burger|author=Carien du Plessis|language=Afrikaans|date=14 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the new party's Sandton convention, the name ''South African Democratic Congress (SADC)'' was also proposed,&lt;ref&gt;[http://152.111.1.87/argief/berigte/dieburger/2008/11/04/KS/6/SSshikota.html Party soek nog naam ‚Äì Media24 Archive] ''Die Burger'' (in Afrikaans){{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110529062006/http://152.111.1.87/argief/berigte/dieburger/2008/11/04/KS/6/SSshikota.html|date=29 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it was later discovered by them that this was already being used by [[South African Democratic Congress|another party]] that was due to contest the 2009 election.&lt;ref name=nameproblems&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.iol.co.za/news/politics/name-problems-for-shikota-422832|title=Name problems for Shikota|publisher=Independent Online|date=3 November 2008|accessdate=21 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 15 November, the name ''Congress of the People'' was chosen,&lt;ref name="nov-15-2008"/&gt; and its official abbreviation was chosen to be ''COPE'', not ''COP''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://jv.dieburger.com//Stories/News/18.0.1067100773.aspx|title=Nuwe party kan nog struikel op pad na registrasie|author=Pieter du Toit|work=Die Burger|language=Afrikaans|date=12 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the name settled on was the ''Congress of the People'', the ANC announced they would challenge this name as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=ANC takes issue with COP over name|url=https://mg.co.za/article/2008-11-11-anc-takes-issue-with-cop-over-name|work=Mail &amp; Guardian|date=11 November 2008|accessdate=21 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ANC's application to the Pretoria Provincial Division of the High Court for an interdict to prevent COPE from using the name Congress of the People, cited that the ANC itself was affiliated to the [[Congress of the People (1955)|1955 Congress of the People]], held in [[Kliptown]]. On 12 December 2008, the court ruled that COPE would not be barred from using its present name.

===Allan Boesak===
The elevation of Boesak to the COPE leadership, given his record as a convicted malefactor, drew considerable censure from press and public alike. It was intimated that the party's self-projection as a morally pure alternative had been sullied. On 5 February 2009, on his [[Facebook]] page, Lekota urged supporters:

&lt;blockquote&gt;We should also not be distracted now by who serves in the interim leadership, because ultimately the people's voice will be heard. They will vote for their leaders, and everyone else will apply for a job and be interviewed to obtain any position. So, you see, I am not bothered by who joins COPE, or if the individual has a criminal record, or not. Is it not so, that if a gangster goes to church, he expects to dance to [[gospel music]], not [[kwaito]]? He's fully aware of what music determines the song and dance in church. No-one is forced to join COPE ‚Äì people join voluntarily, fully aware of what the organisation stands for. So, why worry about who joins? Let them; they'll dance to our music!&lt;ref&gt;Lekota, Mosiuoa. "[http://www.facebook.com/topic.php?uid=39661395138&amp;topic=6331&amp;ref=mf What does COPE need to do, to win the coming elections?]", [[Facebook]]. 5 February 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7067">'''Daniel Arlon Vogel''' (born 1955)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Indian origins and the Book of Mormon : religious solutions from Columbus to Joseph Smith / Dan Vogel. |work= |publisher=[[Signature Books]] |url=http://signaturebookslibrary.org/scripture-test/ |accessdate=2017-09-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is an independent researcher, writer, and author on a number of works that include ''[[Joseph Smith: The Making of a Prophet]].'' and is most known for his work on Early Mormon Documents. 

== Joseph Smith biography ==

Vogel was awarded the Best Book award in September 2004 by the [[John Whitmer Historical Association]] and the Turner-Bergera Best Biography award by the [[Mormon History Association]] in May 2005 for his biography ''[[Joseph Smith: The Making of a Prophet]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jwha.info/awards/default.asp "JWHA Awards"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090421120747/http://www.jwha.info/awards/default.asp |date=2009-04-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mhahome.org/awards/2004.php "MHA 2005 Award Winners"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090421073225/http://www.mhahome.org/awards/2004.php |date=2009-04-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vogel argues in the biography that Joseph Smith was a [[pious fraud]]‚Äîthat Smith essentially invented his religious claims for what he believed were noble, faith-promoting purposes. Vogel identifies the roots of the pious fraud in the conflict between members of the Smith family, who were divided between the skepticism and universalism of [[Joseph Smith, Sr.]], and the more mainstream Protestant faith of [[Lucy Mack Smith]]. Vogel interweaves the history of [[Joseph Smith]] with interpretation of the [[Book of Mormon]], which is read as springing from the young man's psychology and experiences.

== Reception ==

Vogel's scholarship on the topic has been debated by [[Mormon apologists]] and scholars who have stated that he is critical of Mormon faith claims.&lt;ref&gt;[http://farms.byu.edu/publications/review/?reviewed_books&amp;vol=17&amp;num=2&amp;id=588 "Dan Vogel's Family Romance and the Book of Mormon as Smith Family Allegory"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.mormoninterpreter.com/book-of-mormon-minimalists-and-the-nhm-inscriptions-a-response-to-dan-vogel/#rf7-4578|title=Book of Mormon Minimalists and the NHM Inscriptions: A Response to Dan Vogel|first1=Rappleye,|last1=Neal|first2=Smoot, Stephen|last2=O.|date=6 November 2018|publisher=|journal=Interpreter: A Journal of Mormon Scripture|volume=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://josephsmithspolygamy.org/dialogues/hales-vogel-2/|title=Hales - Vogel - Joseph Smith's Polygamy|author=|date=|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has also been criticized by [[ex-Mormon]]s{{who|date=March 2013}} and [[anti-Mormonism|anti-Mormons]]{{who|date=September 2017}} for not being sufficiently critical of Joseph Smith. Larry Morris praised his efforts to produce the multi-volume ''Early Mormon Documents''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Morris | first=Larry | title= Joseph Smith and "Interpretive Biography" | url= http://farms.byu.edu/publications/review/?vol=18&amp;num=1&amp;id=611 |quote=Dan Vogel has made a significant and lasting contribution to Mormon studies, and he deserves to be thanked for his bibliographic work. I sincerely appreciate his prodigious research.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vogel has also edited volumes skeptical of the possibility of receiving the future through the word of God.  

Many of Vogel's books have been critically reviewed by members of [[FARMS]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.farmsresearch.com/publications/review/?reviewed_author=74|title=FARMS reviews of Dan Vogel's works|author=|date=|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in 1991, Mormon religion professor and FARMS scholar [[Stephen E. Robinson]] suggested that Vogel's arguments closely resemble those of [[Korihor]], an atheist polemicist in the ''Book of Mormon''.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen E. Robinson, "Review of The Word of God: Essays on Mormon Scripture by Dan Vogel," FARMS Review of Books 3/1 (1991): 312‚Äì318.

'''Daniel Angelocrator''' (1569 ‚Äì 1635), real surname Engelhardt, was a German [[Reformed]] [[minister (Christianity)|minister]].

==Life==
He was born on 19 October 1569 in [[Korbach]]. He studied theology at the [[University of Marburg]] and [[University of Franeker]] from 1588 to 1589. Angelocrater then took a job accompanying two young aristocrats to the Universities of Marburg and [[Helmstedt]]. In 1594 he clashed with his father over his Calvinism, moved to [[Geneva]] and stayed with a former pupil. 

Angelocrater then was employed in the High School of [[Stade]]. From 1597 to 1606 he was a prominent minister in [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Kassel|Hesse-Kassel]], in various cities. [[Maurice, Landgrave of Hesse-Kassel]] in 1607 made him Archdeacon of Marburg, and 1614 the Superintendent. He was one of the delegates to the [[Synod of Dort]] in 1618.

In the [[Thirty Years' War]] the neighbouring [[Lutheran]] state of [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Darmstadt|Hesse-Darmstadt]] was opposed to Hesse-Kassel, and in 1624 Angelocrator had to leave to escape its troops.  As minister of [[Gudensberg]], and supervising [[Obervorsch√ºtz]], he then lost everything in 1626 to the pillaging Imperial troops of [[Johann Tserclaes, Count of Tilly]]. He was appointed to the [[Consistory (Protestantism)|consistory]] at [[Kassel]], and then went in 1627 to [[K√∂then]], where he died on 30 July 1635.

==Works==
He is known, as well as a minister, as a [[chronologist]] for his ''Chronologia Autoptica'' (1601),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sfb-frueheneuzeit.uni-muenchen.de/projekte/zusatz/HistorischeTabellenwerke/Engelhardt.html |title=Historische Tabellenwerke - Engelhardt |website=Sfb-frueheneuzeit.uni-muenchen.de |date=2005-04-25 |accessdate=2016-02-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304185333/http://www.sfb-frueheneuzeit.uni-muenchen.de/projekte/zusatz/HistorischeTabellenwerke/Engelhardt.html |archivedate=2016-03-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; which placed reliance on the works of the forger [[Annius of Viterbo]],&lt;ref&gt;[[:fr:s:Page:Michaud - Biographie universelle ancienne et moderne - 1843 - Tome 1.djvu/710]]&lt;/ref&gt; and cartographer for a map in his ''Doctrina de ponderibus, monetis, et mensuris''.

''''deFENCE'''' is an [[interactive]] [[conceptual art]] project for freedom of cohabitation, designed in such a way as to include each beholder personally. In tradition of [[Marcel Duchamp]], the ''two main roles'' of this exhibit are the work itself, and the person watching it. Only here, the subjective role of the beholder is not the only one. They are personally drawn into the exhibit, by way of a [[mirror]]. &lt;br /&gt;
The work represents a house, with its door wide open, inviting and welcoming every visitor. Except, a certain visitor is watching this house over a barbed wire fence. On the other hand, this visitor is being watched from the window of the house. The author's intention was to combine these two persons into one, so that people who had never had the chance to be on the other side of the barbed wire, can benefit in two ways: Firstly, they can see how it is to be looking over a barbed wire into a house inviting you, which you cannot reach. And secondly, they can see themselves passively looking from the house at the person outside the fence, doing nothing to remove this segregation.

The concept of this project is to bring to the attention of people living in the 'free' world that many of the boundaries that segregate others in a 'non free' world, are created by themselves. Or, at least, they do nothing to remove these boundaries.&lt;br /&gt;
The wish of the author is to help remove all boundaries that separate people and worlds.

''Note:'' 'deFENCE' project was created by Gregor Markoviƒá from [[Serbia]], in January 2006. It has been selected to take part at the International Design Biennial in St. Etienne, in 2006.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5737">{{About|the narrative device|other uses of "epilogue" and "epilog"|Epilogue (disambiguation)}}
An '''epilogue''' or '''epilog''' (from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] ·ºêœÄŒØŒªŒøŒ≥ŒøœÇ ''ep√≠logos'', "conclusion" from ·ºêœÄŒØ ''epi'', "in addition" and ŒªœåŒ≥ŒøœÇ ''logos'', "word") is a piece of writing at the end of a work of literature, usually used to bring closure to the work.&lt;ref name="EpiDevice"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://literarydevices.net/epilogue/ | title=Literary Devices: Definition and Examples of Literary Terms: Epilogue|date=2014| publisher=Literary Devices | work=Literary Devices Website | accessdate=19 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is presented from the perspective of within the story. When the author steps in and speaks indirectly to the reader, that is more properly considered an [[afterword]]. The opposite is a [[prologue]]&amp;mdash;a piece of writing at the ''beginning'' of a work of literature or drama, usually used to open the story and capture interest.&lt;ref name="ProDevice"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://literarydevices.net/epilogue/ | title=Literary Devices: Definition and Examples of Literary Terms: Prologue|date=2014| publisher=Literary Devices | work=Literary Devices Website | accessdate=19 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some genres, for example [[television programs]]&lt;nowiki/&gt; and [[video games]], call the epilog an "outro" patterned on the use of "intro" for "introduction".

==In literature==
[[Image:Grandville, Autre Monde, Epilog.jpg|thumb|right|240px|Illustration from ''Un Autre Monde'' epilogue, by [[Jean Ignace Isidore G√©rard Grandville|Grandville]].]]

An epilogue is the final [[chapter (books)|chapter]] at the end of a [[narrative|story]] that often serves to reveal the fates of the [[Character (arts)|character]]s. Some epilogues may feature [[Scene (drama)|scenes]] only tangentially related to the subject of the story. They can be used to hint at a sequel or wrap up all the loose ends. They can occur at a significant period of time after the main [[plot (narrative)|plot]] has ended. In some cases, the epilogue is used to allow the main character a chance to "speak freely".

An epilogue can continue in the same narrative style and perspective as the preceding story, although the form of an epilogue can occasionally be drastically different from the overall story. It can also be used as a [[sequel]].

==In film==
In [[film]]s, the final scenes may feature a montage of images or clips with a short explanation of what happens to the characters. A few examples of such films are ''[[9 to 5 (film)|9 to 5]]'', ''[[American Graffiti]]'', ''[[National Lampoon's Animal House]]'', ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows ‚Äì Part 2]]'', ''[[Four Weddings and a Funeral]]'', ''[[Remember the Titans]]'', and ''[[Changeling (film)|Changeling]]''.

There are many films which do not only include a few glimpses of the character's future, but also are based on an epilogue. Most epilogues in films are shown in a dramatic fashion, usually in silence, to commemorate an important happening, for example, the fate of a character in the film.

The epilogue of ''[[La La Land (film)|La La Land]]'' shows a happy ending, an alternative to the actual ending. 

In many [[documentaries]] and [[biopics]], the epilogue is text-based, explaining what happened to the subjects after the events covered in the film.

==In video gaming==
In [[Video game|video gaming]], epilogues can occur at the end of the story, usually after the [[Credit (creative arts)|credits]] have rolled. An epilogue in a game functions similarly to an epilogue in [[film]] and [[literature]], providing closure to the end of a story.

However, the way in which an epilogue is interacted with in a video game can then determine how a story ends, in works of fiction that contain [[Types of fiction with multiple endings#Video games|multiple endings]]. For example, there are four possible endings to ''[[Spec Ops: The Line]]'', and three of the endings are chosen by what the player does in the epilogue.

In games that feature the [[Permadeath|permanent death]] of [[Player character|playable characters]], an epilogue can chronicle what has happened to the various characters that have survived the events of the game, depicting how their situation has changed after the story has come to a conclusion. For example, the 2015 video game ''[[Until Dawn]]'' features those who survived recounting their experiences to the Police after being rescued. This system can also be expanded on. In most games of the ''[[Fire Emblem]]'' series, relationships can be built between characters, allowing for unique outcomes to happen for characters depending on the actions of the player throughout the campaign.

A [[visual novel]] can also feature a type of epilogue, which will wrap up all of the scenarios encountered by a player, most often after the game has been fully completed by reaching all of the multiple endings; as is the case with ''[[Tsukihime]]'', featuring an epilogue that expands on the endings of all completable routes, as well as providing context for the rest of the game by explaining events in the prologue.

==In television==
For many years ''[[The Epilogue]]'', a reflective 5-minute [[sermonette]], was the last programme of the day broadcast on a Sunday evening by [[BBC]] radio and later television. The format was picked up by the independent broadcaster [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] in 1956 and was adopted across its various franchises until 1988.

'''''Existenz''''' is an on-line biannual [[academic journal]] covering research in [[philosophy]], [[religion]], [[politics]], and [[the arts]]. Established in 2006 by its founding editors [[Alan M. Olson]] and [[Helmut Wautischer]] and is sponsored by the [[Karl Jaspers Society of North America]]. Its title, ''Existenz'', derives from an essential feature of the philosophy of [[Karl Jaspers]], namely, the notion of ''[[Dasein#Karl Jaspers' Dasein and Existenz|m√∂gliche Existenz]]'' or "possible self-being" for which Jaspers became famous as one of the world's leading [[Existentialism|existentialist philosophers]] in the 20th century.

The journal serves as a publication outlet for Jaspers scholarship, cooperates with various international Jaspers societies, including those in the United States, Japan, Poland, Germany, Austria, Italy, and Croatia, and also considers direct submissions of articles for online publication. ''Existenz'' is indexed by [[Philosopher's Information Center|The Philosopher's Index]] and included in the [[EBSCO Information Services|EBSCO]] database.

'''Float glass''' is a sheet of [[glass]] made by floating molten glass on a bed of molten metal, typically [[tin]], although [[lead]] and various low [[melting point]] alloys were used in the past. This method gives the sheet uniform thickness and very flat surfaces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Step-by-step Manufacturing of Float Glass|url=http://www.pilkington.com/pilkington-information/about+pilkington/education/float+process/step+by+step.htm|publisher=Pilkington|accessdate=18 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Modern [[window]]s are made from float glass. Most float glass is [[soda-lime glass]], but relatively minor quantities of specialty [[borosilicate]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.schott.com/hometech/english/products/borofloat/index.html|title=Borosilikatglas BOROFLOAT¬Æ {{!}} SCHOTT AG|website=www.schott.com|language=en|access-date=2017-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[flat panel display]] glass are also produced using the float glass process.&lt;ref&gt;Not all flat panel display glass is produced by the float glass process. The company [[Corning Incorporated|Corning]] is using the [[Overflow downdraw method|overflow downdraw technique]], while [[Schott Glass|Schott]] uses the float glass technique (see [http://www.schott.com/fpd/english/lcd_glass/index.html Schott website]).&lt;/ref&gt; The float glass process is also known as the '''Pilkington process''', named after the British glass manufacturer [[Pilkington]], which pioneered the technique (invented by Sir [[Alastair Pilkington]]) in the 1950s at their production site in [[St Helens, Merseyside]].

== History ==
[[File:windowfloatnofloat.jpg|thumb|right|Old [[window]] containing a single sheet of float glass in the upper left section, [[Jena]], [[Germany]]. The remaining sections are possibly not float glass as indicated by the distorted reflections of a tree.]]
Until the 16th century, window glass or [[flat glass]] was generally cut from large discs (or rondels) of [[crown glass (window)|crown glass]]. Larger sheets of glass were made by [[glassblowing|blowing]] large [[Cylinder blown sheet|cylinders]] which were cut open and flattened, then cut into panes. Most window glass in the early 19th century was made using the [[cylinder method]]. The 'cylinders' were {{convert|6|to|8|ft|cm}} long and {{convert|10|to|14|in|cm}} in diameter, limiting the width that panes of glass could be cut, and resulting in windows divided by transoms into rectangular panels.

The first advances in automating glass manufacturing were patented in 1848 by [[Henry Bessemer]], an [[England|English]] [[engineer]].&lt;ref&gt;Bessemer, Henry ; British patent no. 12,101 (issued: Sept. 22, 1848).&lt;/ref&gt; His system produced a continuous ribbon of flat glass by forming the ribbon between rollers. This was an expensive process, as the surfaces of the glass needed polishing. If the glass could be set on a perfectly smooth, flat body, like the surface of an open pan of calm liquid, this would reduce costs considerably. Attempts were made to form flat glass on a bath of molten tin‚Äîone of the few liquids denser than glass that would be calm at the high temperatures needed to make glass‚Äîmost notably in the US. Several patents were granted,&lt;ref&gt;See:

Before the development of float glass, larger sheets of plate glass were made by casting a large puddle of glass on an [[iron]] surface, and then polishing both sides, a costly process. From the early 1920s, a continuous ribbon of plate glass was passed through a lengthy series of inline grinders and polishers, reducing glass losses and cost.

Glass of lower quality, drawn glass, was made by drawing upwards from a pool of molten glass a thin sheet, held at the edges by rollers. As it cooled the rising sheet stiffened and could then be cut. The two surfaces were of lower quality i.e. not as smooth or uniform as those of float glass. This process continued in use for many years after the development of float glass.

Between 1953 and 1957, Sir [[Alastair Pilkington]] and Kenneth Bickerstaff of the UK's Pilkington Brothers developed the first successful commercial application for forming a continuous ribbon of glass using a molten [[tin]] bath on which the molten glass flows unhindered under the influence of gravity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1098/rspa.1969.0212 | title = Review Lecture.

In 1964, CH3 Tank, the first purpose-built float line in the world, was built after the conversion of CH4 Tank. CH1 Tank closed down in 1977 as CH2 Float Line started up. The Pilkington's production line at Cowley Hill, St Helens, the birthplace of float glass, is no longer in operation as of 2014 although Pilkington continue to operate other float glass facilities within the town.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Pilkington boss on Cowley Hill : 'Float glass production losing tens of millions' |url=http://www.sthelensstar.co.uk/news/10794410.Pilks_boss___Float_glass_production_losing_tens_of_millions_/?ref=rl |newspaper=St Helens Star |location=St Helens |date=7 November 2013 |access-date=8 September 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Manufacture==
[[File:Floatglasanlage.jpg|thumb|Float glas line]]
Float glass uses common glass-making [[Glass#Glass ingredients|raw materials]], typically consisting of [[sand]], soda ash ([[sodium carbonate]]), [[dolomite]], [[limestone]], and salt cake ([[sodium sulfate]]) etc. Other materials may be used as colourants, [[refining (glass)|refining]] agents or to adjust the physical and chemical properties of the glass. The raw materials are mixed in a [[glass batch|batch]] process, then fed together with suitable [[cullet]] (waste glass), in a controlled ratio, into a furnace where it is heated to approximately 1500&amp;nbsp;¬∞C. Common flat glass furnaces are 9&amp;nbsp;m wide, 45&amp;nbsp;m long, and contain more than 1200&amp;nbsp;tons of glass. Once molten, the temperature of the glass is stabilised to approximately 1200&amp;nbsp;¬∞C to ensure a homogeneous [[specific gravity]].

The molten glass is fed into a "tin bath", a bath of molten [[tin]] (about 3‚Äì4&amp;nbsp;m wide, 50&amp;nbsp;m long, 6&amp;nbsp;cm deep), from a delivery canal and is poured into the tin bath by a ceramic lip known as the spout lip.&lt;ref name=ullmann&gt;B. H. W. S. de Jong, "Glass"; in ''Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry''; 5th edition, vol. A12, VCH Publishers, Weinheim, Germany, 1989, {{ISBN|3-527-20112-2}}, pp. 365‚Äì432.&lt;/ref&gt; The amount of glass allowed to pour onto the molten tin is controlled by a gate called a ''tweel''.

Tin is suitable for the float glass process because it has a high specific gravity, is cohesive, and is [[immiscible]] with molten glass. Tin, however, [[Redox|oxidises]] in a natural atmosphere to form [[tin dioxide]] (SnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). Known in the production process as dross, the tin dioxide adheres to the glass. To prevent oxidation, the tin bath is provided with a [[positive pressure]] protective atmosphere of [[nitrogen]] and [[hydrogen]].

The glass flows onto the tin surface forming a floating ribbon with perfectly smooth surfaces on both sides and of even thickness. As the glass flows along the tin bath, the temperature is gradually reduced from 1100&amp;nbsp;¬∞C until at approximately 600&amp;nbsp;¬∞C the sheet can be lifted from the tin onto rollers. The glass ribbon is pulled off the bath by rollers at a controlled speed. Variation in the flow speed and roller speed enables glass sheets of varying thickness to be formed. Top rollers positioned above the molten tin may be used to control both the thickness and the width of the glass ribbon.

Once off the bath, the glass sheet passes through a [[lehr (glassmaking)|lehr kiln]] for approximately 100&amp;nbsp;m, where it is cooled gradually so that it [[Annealing (glass)|anneals]] without strain and does not crack from the temperature change. On exiting the "cold end" of the kiln, the glass is cut by machines.

[[File:Green color of float glass.jpg|thumb|A float glass light fitting. Ordinary float glass is green in thicker sheets due to [[Fe2+]] impurities.]]
Today, float glass is the most widely used form of glass in consumer products. Due to both its high quality with no additional polishing required and its structural flexibility during production, it can easily be shaped and bent into a variety of forms while in a heated, syrupy state. This makes it ideal for a variety of applications such as

* Automobile glass (e.g. windshields, windows, mirrors)
* Mirrors
* Furniture (e.g. in tables and shelves)
* Insulated glass
* Windows and doors

Most forms of specialized glass such as [[toughened glass]], [[frosted glass]], laminated safety glass and soundproof glass consist of standard float glass that has been further processed.

==Market==
As of 2009, the world float glass market, not including China and Russia, is dominated by the four companies: [[Asahi Glass]], [[Nippon Sheet Glass|NSG]]/[[Pilkington]], [[Saint-Gobain]], and [[Guardian Industries]]. Other companies include Sise Cam AS, [[PPG Industries|PPG]], Central Glass, Hankuk (HanGlas), Zeledyne, and Cardinal Glass Industries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.constructiondigital.com/Flat-glass-market-be-39-million-tons-2010_811 "Flat glass market to be 39 million tons by 2010"]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
He was born in [[Brittany]], [[France]]. In 1901 he arrived in [[Tonkin]] after having joined the [[Soci√©t√© des Missions-Etrang√®res de Paris]] (MEP).&lt;ref name=Michaudp209/&gt; He was 25 years old at the time.&lt;ref name=Culasp114&gt;Culas, Christian. ''Le messianisme hmong aux 19e et 20e si√®cles. La dynamique religieuse comme instrument politique'' (Chemins de l'ethnologie, ISSN 1257-9947). [[Les Editions de la MSH]] ([[:fr:Fondation Maison des sciences de l'homme|FR]]), 2005. p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=Ny-H_JjlLFEC&amp;pg=PA114 114]. {{ISBN|2735116670}}, 9782735116676.&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially Savina worked with Hmong in [[L√†o Cai]], [[Vietnam]].&lt;ref name=Culasp114/&gt; From 1906 to 1925 Savina worked with the [[Hmong people]] in [[Yunnan]], China,&lt;ref name=Tappp67/&gt;&lt;ref name=Culasp114/&gt; and also with Hmong in northern [[French Indochina]].&lt;ref name=Tappp67/&gt; From 1918 to 1921 Savina had an official assignment in Laos. Beginning in 1925 he worked as an ethnographic field research representative of the [[√âcole fran√ßaise d'Extr√™me-Orient]] (EFEO). During that assignment he was based in Hainan and made frequent trips to [[Hong Kong]] where he interacted with a printing house of the MEP. This assignment ended in 1928.&lt;ref name=Michaudp209/&gt;

He resumed his missionary activities in 1939 and moved to [[Ha Giang]] in Upper Tonkin. He was hospitalized in [[Hanoi]] after he came down with [[pneumonia]] in March 1941. At age 65 he died on July 23 of that year.&lt;ref name=Michaudp209/&gt;

==Publications==
Savina collected his own data to build eight dictionaries of languages of Southeast Asia, including those in highland and lowland areas. The dictionaries and four [[lexicons]] he wrote combined have a total of over 5,000 pages; these were published from 1911 to 1939.&lt;ref name=Michaudp209/&gt; Savina also wrote histories and ethnographic texts.&lt;ref name=KeithCharlesp123/&gt; Many of his works are about the Hmong people.&lt;ref name=Tappp67/&gt; Savina's publications discuss the [[Ao language|Ao]], [[Be language|Be]], Chinese, [[Day language|Day]], [[Hiai language|Hiai]], [[Hokkien|Hoklo]], [[Miao language|Miao]], [[Nung language (Tai)|Nung]], [[Tay language|Tay]], and Vietnamese languages.&lt;ref name=Michaudp209/&gt; His works appeared in academic journals of the era.&lt;ref name=KeithCharlesp123/&gt;

Savina wrote ''[[Histoire des Miao]]'', published in 1924, and ''Monographie de [[Hainan]]'' ("Monograph of Hainan Island"), published in 1929. Of Savina's writings, ''Histoire des Miao'' is the most well-known and the most often cited.&lt;ref name=Michaudp209/&gt; He wrote a 1920 confidential report titled "Rapport politique sur la r√©volte des M√©os au Tonkin et au Laos."&lt;ref name=Culasp114/&gt;

William |title=Presidential Address: The Structure of Chinese History |journal=The Journal of Asian Studies |date=February 1985 |volume=44 |issue=2 |pages=271 |doi=10.2307/2055923}}&lt;/ref&gt; He often referred to his approach as "regional analysis," and taught the use of maps as a key class of data in [[ethnography]].

==Early life==
Skinner was born on February 14, 1925, in [[Oakland, California]]. His father, [[John James Skinner]] was a pharmacologist and his mother, [[Eunice Engle Skinner]], taught music and became the director of music education for the Berkeley school system. Skinner spent two years at [[Deep Springs College]], a small college founded to educate small cohorts of young men into the life of the mind in a self-sufficient, disciplined manner. After Deep Springs, he joined the Navy [[V-12 Navy College Training Program|V-12 Program]] in 1943, then attended the U.S. [[Navy Oriental Language School]] for 18 months at the [[University of Colorado, Boulder]], where he studied Chinese. In 1946, Skinner headed for [[Cornell University]] to complete his B.A. degree. He graduated in the following year with his B.A. (with distinction) in [[Far Eastern Studies]], and remained there for his Ph.D. in anthropology (1954) under the supervision of [[Lauriston Sharp]].

==Academic career==
Skinner‚Äôs first job was as instructor in sociology at Cornell in 1949. Late in that year he flew to [[Chengdu]], in China's Sichuan province, to conduct doctoral dissertation research on the structure of markets in the Chengdu Plain. Skinner's research was cut short by the arrival of the [[People's Liberation Army]], which confiscated his notes, but the experience became the basis of his later work on spatial modelling. Skinner proceeded to Bangkok, Thailand, where he researched a substitute doctoral topic, the social structure of the Chinese community in Thailand. This research was published in his first two books, ''Chinese Society in Thailand'' (1957) and ''Leadership and Power in the Chinese Community of Thailand'' (1958) {{sfnp|Harrell|2009|p=454}}

Between 1951 and 1955, he was field director of the [[Cornell Southeast Asia Program]], then a research associate at Cornell. He became assistant professor of anthropology at [[Columbia University]] in 1958. Two years later, Skinner was hired back at Cornell as associate professor and then promoted to full professor in 1962 ‚Äî an unusually fast track to that status. In 1965, he left for [[Stanford University]], moving again in 1990 to the [[University of California, Davis]], which had hired his wife, China historian [[Susan L. Mann]]. Skinner retired from teaching in 2005 but maintained an active research program until his death three years later.{{sfnp|Verdery|Smith|2009}}

==Research==
Perhaps his best-known influence on Chinese Studies was his delineation of the [[Physiographic macroregions of China]].&lt;ref&gt;G.W. Skinner (ed.) (1977) "The City in Late Imperial China."

[http://www.asian-studies.org/publications/cart/Members.aspx?Action=ServiceDetail&amp;productID=407]&lt;/ref&gt;  In later years he was instrumental in the establishment of the China Historical Geographic Information Systems project at Harvard and [[Fudan]] Universities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fas.harvard.edu/~chgis CHGIS Project]&lt;/ref&gt;  His papers and maps are archived in the library collections of Harvard, Cornell,&lt;ref&gt;[http://rmc.library.cornell.edu/ead/htmldocs/RMA02778.html Guide to the G.

'''Giugliano in Campania''' {{IPA-it|d íu éÀà éaÀêno i≈ã kamÀàpaÀênja|}}, also known simply as '''Giugliano''', is a city and ''[[comune]]'' in the [[Metropolitan City of Naples]], [[Campania]], [[Italy]]. {{As of|2017}}, it had some 124,000 inhabitants,&lt;ref name="istat"&gt;{{it icon}} [http://demo.istat.it/pop2016/index.html Source]:  [[National Institute of Statistics (Italy)|Istat]] 2016&lt;/ref&gt; making it the [[List of cities in Italy by population|most populated Italian city]] that is not a provincial capital.

==History==
In 5th-4th century BCE the territory of Giugliano was settled by the [[Osci]]. According to a tradition, the city was founded by a group of colonists from [[Cumae|Cuma]] in 421 BCE, who called it ''Lilianum'' ("Land of the lilies"). 

Near "Lake Patria", there was the ancient city of [[Liternum]]. In 194 BC it became a [[Roman colony]]. The town is mainly famous as the residence of the [[Scipio Africanus|elder Scipio Africanus]], who withdrew from Rome and died there&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=AA. |first=VV. |title=A new guide of Naples, its environs, Procida, Ischia and Capri |publisher= |date=1826 |page=384 |url= https://books.google.it/books?id=4R4TAAAAQAAJ&amp;hl=it&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s}}&lt;/ref&gt;. His tomb and villa are described by [[Seneca the Younger]]&lt;ref&gt;Seneca, Epistulae Morales 86&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Livy 48.52&lt;/ref&gt;. In 455, the town was pillaged and destroyed by [[Genseric]] and his [[Vandals]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=AA. |first=VV. |title=A new guide of Naples, its environs, Procida, Ischia and Capri |publisher= |date=1826 |page=386 |url= https://books.google.it/books?id=4R4TAAAAQAAJ&amp;hl=it&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The surviving population migrated to the present historical center of Giugliano.

The city remained a small center until 1207, when Cuma was destroyed by the [[Naples|Neapolitans]]; some of the citizens from that town, including the clergy and the cathedral capitular, took shelter in Giugliano. The first documents mentioning a fief in Giugliano dates from 1270.

Lords of the city were, in sequence, the Vulcano, Filomarino, [[Pignatelli]], [[D'Aquino]], Pinelli and [[Colonna family|Colonna]].

==Geography==
It is located in a fertile coastal plain north of Naples, thus serving as a market for agricultural products to the city. The plain on which it sits was known in ancient Roman times as the Campania Felix.

===Neighboring communes===
Giugliano in Campania borders the following municipalities: [[Aversa]], [[Casapesenna]],   [[Castel Volturno]], [[Lusciano]], [[Melito di Napoli]], [[Mugnano di Napoli]], [[Parete]], [[Pozzuoli]], [[Qualiano]], [[Quarto]], [[San Cipriano d'Aversa]], [[Sant'Antimo]], [[Trentola-Ducenta]], [[Villa Literno]] and [[Villaricca]].&lt;ref&gt;{{OSM|r|40849|Giugliano}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Main sights==
*''Palazzo Pinelli'', built in 1545 by architect [[Giovanni Francesco di Palma]]. It had a side tower, which was later demolished.
*Church of ''Santa Sofia'' (17th century), designed by [[Domenico Fontana]]. It was finished in 1730-1745 by the Neapolitan architect [[Domenico Antonio Vaccaro]]. It houses the tomb of [[Giovan Battista Basile]].
*Church of the ''Annunziata'', known from the 16th century. It is home to several canvasses by Neapolitan artists such as [[Massimo Stanzione]] and [[Carlo Sellitto]]. it has a nave with [[apse]] and [[transept]]; the [[pulpit]] is in Roccoco style, while the rest of the interior is decorated in Baroque style. Notable are also the large wooden organ (late 16th century), the Chapel of ''Madonna della Pace'' and early 16th ''Stories of the Virgin' in the left transept.
*Church of ''Sant'Anna''. Of the original building, existing in the 14th century, the bell tower remains. It houses 16th-century paintings by [[Fabrizio Santafede]] and [[Pietro Negroni]].
*Church of ''Madonna delle Grazie'', with a 14th-century bell tower and a 16th-century portal. The interior has a 15th-century Gothic ''Incoronation of the Virgin'' and early 16th-century frescoes.
*Church of ''Santa Maria della Purit√†'' or of ''the Souls of Purgatory''(18th century). It was designed by [[Domenico Antonio Vaccaro]], who also designed the internal stuccos and the covering of the dome, made as fish scales. The structure is an octagonal plant and has four altars, besides the greater one.
*Ancient town of ''[[Liternum]]''. The excavations brought to light, between 1930 and 1936, some elements of the city center ([[Forum (Roman)|forum]] with a temple, a basilica and a small theater) dating from the beginning of the Roman Empire. Outside the city walls, the remains of the [[amphitheater]] and the [[necropolis]] have been identified.
*Lake Patria, in the [[frazione]] of the same name, it was called by ancient Roman "Literna Palus". It is part of the Natural Reserve "Foce Volurno - Costa di Licola".

==Transportation==
Giugliano is served by [[Naples‚ÄìAversa railway]], a railway suburban train connection to the [[Naples Metro]]. Another station, Giugliano-[[Qualiano]], is located some kilometers outside the city. It is part of the [[Villa Literno‚ÄìNapoli Gianturco railway|Villa Literno‚ÄìNaples line]], a branch of the [[Rome‚ÄìFormia‚ÄìNaples railway]].

The '''Harifian''' is a specialized regional cultural development of the [[Epipaleolithic (Levant)|Epipalaeolithic]] of the [[Negev Desert]]. It corresponds to the latest stages of the [[Natufian]] culture. Like the Natufian, it is characterized by semi-subterranean houses. These are often more elaborate than those found at Natufian sites. For the first time arrowheads are found among the stone tool kit. 

Andy Burns states "The Harifian dates to between approximately 10,800/10,500bp and 10,000/10,200bp. It is restricted to the Sinai and Negev, and is probably broadly contemporary with the [[Natufian Culture|Late Natufian]] or [[Pre-Pottery Neolithic A]]. 

[[Microlith]]ic points are a characteristic feature of the industry, with the Harif point being both new and particularly diagnostic ‚Äì Bar-Yosef (1998) suggests that it is an indication of improved hunting techniques. Lunates, isosceles and other triangular forms were backed with retouch, and some [[Helwan retouch|Helwan lunates]] are found. This industry contrasts with the Desert Natufian which did not have the roughly triangular points in its assemblage.

There are two main groups within the Harifian. One group consists of ephemeral base camps in the north of Sinai and western Negev, where stone points comprise up to 88% of all microliths, accompanied by only a few lunates and triangles. The other group consists of base camps and smaller campsites in the Negev and features a greater number of lunates and triangles than points. These sites probably represent functional rather than chronological differences. The presence of [[Khiam]] points in some sites indicates that there was communication with other areas in the Levant at this time."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.near-east.historians.co.uk/html/epipalaeolithic.html Burns, Andy "Epipaeleolithic"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080411053240/http://www.near-east.historians.co.uk/html/epipalaeolithic.html |date=2008-04-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Harifian has close connections with the late Mesolithic cultures of [[Fayyum]] and the Eastern Deserts of Egypt, whose tool assemblage resembles that of the Harifian. Fusion with animal domestication elements of the Pre-Pottery Neolithic B ([[PPNB]]) culture is hypothesised by [[Juris Zarins]], to have led to the Circum Arabian Nomadic Pastoral Complex, a group of cultures that invented [[nomadic pastoralism]], and may have been the original culture which spread [[Proto-Semitic]] languages throughout the region.&lt;ref&gt;Zarins Juris (1990), "Early Pastoral Nomadism and the Settlement of Lower Mesopotamia" (Bulletin of the American Schools of Oriental Research), No. 280 (Nov., 1990), pp. 31-65&lt;/ref&gt;

==Creation==

===Introduction===
With the arrival of [[Sebastian von Lahnstein]] in November 2007, it is mentioned that he had two other siblings. They are referred to as the twins, without letting the audience know their gender. The twins get mentioned several times over two years, when Helena arrives at Castle K√∂nigsbrunn and gives one of the twins a face and a name. With her appearance it has been declared that she has a twin brother named [[Tristan von Lahnstein|Tristan]] ([[Jens Hartwig]]). Before Helena comes to K√∂nigsbrunn a box with Asian art has been sent to the Lahnstein family. While wondering what is in the box, Helena opens the door and is welcomed by her brother Sebastian and younger sister [[Rebecca von Lahnstein|Rebecca]]. When the butler of the aristocratic family looks a little bit lost at the situation [[Elisabeth von Lahnstein]] is the first to introduce Helena as Sebastian and Rebecca's sibling.

===Personality===
Helena is described as a happy and cheerful person.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.daserste.de/verboteneliebe/darsteller_dyn~darsteller,996~cm.asp Character trait]&lt;/ref&gt; She studies archeology at the [[University of Heidelberg]] and comes after a long time abroad to meet her siblings at K√∂nigsbrunn. From the beginning it is mentioned that she is extremely close to her twin brother Tristan and cannot be anywhere long  without him.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.daserste.de/verboteneliebe/darsteller_dyn~darsteller,996~cm.asp Feelings about Tristan]&lt;/ref&gt; The relationship between brother and sister seems almost incestuous. It is mentioned by Rebecca that Tristan and Helena can not be without each other and that they forget the world around them when they are together. Not long after Helena's arrival she has to call Tristan and tell him that she misses and loves him. When it is mentioned that Tristan is spending time with [[Tanja von Lahnstein|Tanja]], Helena seems almost jealous and tells Rebecca that it will not last for long anyway.

==Storyline==

===Background===
Helena was born to Ludwig von Lahnstein and is one of his five children. Ludwig married a maid, Madeleine, which upset his father deeply. This leads to Ludwig being disowned and his brother [[Johannes von Lahnstein|Johannes]] becoming the heir to the Lahnstein fortune. Ludwig, his wife and his children leave K√∂nigsbrunn, while Johannes tries to stop his brother and giving him his heritage. But an angry Ludwig leaves and breaks off contact with his family. It has been mentioned that Ludwig and his family moved abroad. When Ludwig and his wife both die, Ludwig's good friend [[Adrian Degenhardt]] takes care of his children. He finances their education and becomes a surrogate father to them. Helena and Tristan travel abroad, while Sebastian and Rebecca have been staying in the [[United States]], before the family reunite after years at Castle K√∂nigsbrunn.

===The Arrival===
Helena has not been to K√∂nigsbrunn since she was a little girl. She's welcome by Rebecca and Sebastian, and wants to spend as much time as possible with her sister since it has been a long time since they last saw each other. Helena discovers that Rebecca has been lying about her job,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.daserste.de/verboteneliebe/folge_dyn~folge,3480~cm.asp Recap of episode 3479]&lt;/ref&gt; and actually she has money troubles and is unemployed. Helena tries to comfort Rebecca, when Elisabeth mentions an article about Helena's latest success in her career; leading Rebecca to be jealous of her sister's success.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.daserste.de/verboteneliebe/folge_dyn~folge,3481~cm.asp Recap of episode 3481]&lt;/ref&gt;

Helena quickly falls in love with [[Andi Fritzsche]] and they become a couple. Their relationship survives several tests, behind of most of which is Tristan, who can't accept that his sister is close to another man. However, they break up for good after Helena discover Andi had a drunk one-night stand with [[Verbotene Liebe minor characters#Jessica Stiehl|Jessica Stiehl]], who had previously accused him of rape trying to break them up.

Later, Helena hits [[Philipp zu Hohenfelden]] with her car and is sentenced to do community service in a D√ºsseldorf hospital, where she meets Andi's brother [[Daniel Fritzsche|Daniel]], and they start a relationship. After several months, however, Daniel falls in love with Jessica and breaks up with Helena, who decides to return to Cambodia and resume her archaeological studies. It's been hinted that after Daniel breaks up with Jessica and leaves D√ºsseldorf they reunite in Cambodia.

This is a [[bibliography]] of works by American writer [[John W. Campbell, Jr.]]

The bibliography is in chronological order of first publication of the books.  In most cases only first editions are shown for each title, with the following exceptions.  Both British and US editions are shown for ''Who Goes There?'' as the title was changed.  ''The Moon is Hell'' was released both as a novel and a short story collection; both versions are shown.  Some confusing variants are shown in full for the ''Astounding Science Fiction Anthology'' and its derivatives; the situation is explained more fully in that section.  Some other variant titles are listed separately, with notes indicating what the original titles were.

The main bibliographic sources are footnoted from this paragraph and provided much of the information in the following sections.&lt;ref name=Nicholls&gt;{{cite book | editor= [[John Clute|Clute, John]] |editor2=[[Peter Nicholls (writer)|Nicholls, Peter]]| title= The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction| year= 1993| publisher= [[St. Martin's Press|St. Martin's Press, Inc.]]| location= New York|isbn=0-312-09618-6| page= 199}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;sup&gt;,&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;ref name=Tuck&gt;{{cite book | first=Donald H. | last=Tuck |authorlink= Donald H.

==Novels and fixups==
*''[[The Mightiest Machine]]''. Providence, Rhode Island: [[Hadley Publishing Company]], 1947; hardcover.  Originally serialized over five issues in Astounding, starting in December 1934.
*''[[The Incredible Planet]]''. Reading: Pennsylvania: [[Fantasy Press]], 1949; hardcover.  Three linked novellas: "The Incredible Planet", "The Interstellar Search", and "The Infinite Atom", originally written as sequels to ''The Mightiest Machine'' but rejected by Tremaine for publication in Astounding.  This is their first publication, so the book is not a [[Fix-up|fixup]] in the usual sense, although the stories were not originally intended for publication as a novel.
*''[[The Moon is Hell]]''.  London: New English Library, 1975; paperback.  See the entry in the short story collection section below.
*''[[The Black Star Passes]]''.  Reading, Pennsylvania: Fantasy Press, 1953; hardcover.  Fixup of three stories in Campbell's "Arcot, Morey and Wade" series, all from 1930: "Piracy Preferred", "Solarite", and "The Black Star Passes".
*''[[Islands of Space]]''. Reading, Pennsylvania: Fantasy Press, 1956; hardcover.  Originally published in Amazing Stories Quarterly, Spring 1931.
*''[[Invaders from the Infinite]]''. Hicksville, New York: [[Gnome Press]], 1961; hardcover simultaneous with: Reading, Pennsylvania: [[Fantasy Press]], 1961; hardcover.  Originally published in Amazing Stories Quarterly, Spring/Summer 1932.  Note that the Gnome Press and Fantasy Press editions were very limited in release.  The Reginald Index&lt;ref name=Reginald /&gt; lists the Fantasy Press as the first edition but this is apparently incorrect.  Both the Tuck Encyclopedia&lt;ref name=Tuck /&gt; and the Chalker-Owings History&lt;ref name=Chalker&gt;{{cite book | last=Chalker | first=Jack L. | authorlink=Jack L. Chalker |author2=Mark Owings | title=The Science-Fantasy Publishers: A Bibliographic History, 1923-1998 | location=Westminster, MD and Baltimore | publisher=Mirage Press, Ltd.| pages=237‚Äì238, 240‚Äì241, 308 | year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; list the editions as simultaneous.  It was to have been a Fantasy Press project, but was handed off to Gnome when the Fantasy Press folded.  [[Lloyd Eshbach]] of Fantasy Press printed the copies for both editions, including 100 that he did for longtime customers.&lt;ref name=Chalker/&gt;
*''The Ultimate Weapon''.  New York: [[Ace Books]], Inc., 1966; paperback.  Bound dos-a-dos with Campbell's ''The Planeteers'', as Ace Double G-585; see below.  Originally serialized in the October and November 1936 Astoundings as ''Uncertainty''.
* "Who Goes There?" Novellete originally published in Astounding, August 1938.

The Nicholls Encyclopedia&lt;ref name=Nicholls /&gt; mentions a 1952 chapbook, published in Australia, as the first edition of ''Who Goes There?'' as a standalone novel, but provides no bibliographic details.  The story itself first saw book form in the 1948 Shasta collection; see below.

==Short story collections and omnibus editions==
*''[[Who Goes There? (collection)|Who Goes There?]]''.  Chicago: [[Shasta Publishers]], 1948; hardcover.  Collection of seven stories.
*''[[The Moon is Hell]]''.  Reading, Pennsylvania: [[Fantasy Press]], 1951; hardcover.  Contains ''The Moon Is Hell'' and also "The Elder Gods", which was originally published in the October 1939 [[Unknown (magazine)|Unknown]] as by Don A. Stuart, but which was actually a collaboration between John Campbell and [[Arthur J. Burks]] according to Contento.&lt;ref name=Contento /&gt;  Chalker reports that Campbell purchased the story from Burks in order to use the concept.&lt;ref name=Chalker/&gt;  Note that this same title is listed above as a novel, since all later editions dropped this short story.  The Tuck Encyclopedia&lt;ref name=Tuck /&gt; and the Chalker History&lt;ref name=Chalker/&gt; give the first edition as "Fantasy, 1950", whereas the Currey bibliography gives the first edition as "Fantasy Press, 1951".&lt;ref name=Currey /&gt;  There does not seem to be support for the Tuck/Chalker date in other sources.
*''[[Cloak of Aesir]]''.  Chicago: [[Shasta Publishers]], 1952; hardcover.  Collection of seven stories.
*''The Thing and Other Stories''. London: Fantasy Books, 1952; paperback.  Reprint of the 1948 Shasta edition of ''Who Goes There?''.

*''The Planeteers''.  New York: Ace Books, Inc., 1966; paperback.  Bound dos-a-dos with Campbell's ''The Ultimate Weapon'', as Ace Double G-585; see above.  This contains all five "Penton and Blake" stories, published in [[Thrilling Wonder Stories]] between 1936 and 1938.
*''The Best of John W. Campbell''.  London: [[Sidgwick &amp; Jackson]], 1973; hardcover.  Five stories, compiled by George Hay; with an introduction by [[James Blish]].

Three previously unpublished stories ‚Äì  "Marooned", "All", and "The Space Beyond"  ‚Äì plus an introduction by Isaac Asimov and an afterword by [[George Zebrowski]].  "All" formed the basis for [[Robert A. Heinlein]]'s novel ''[[Sixth Column]]''.&lt;ref name=Nicholls /&gt;
*''The Best of John W. Campbell''.  Garden City: Nelson Doubleday, Inc., 1976; hardcover.  Note contents differ from 1973 volume with the same title; this selection was edited by [[Lester del Rey]] and contains eleven stories and one article, with an introduction by del Rey and an afterword by Campbell's wife.  All but one story from the 1973 volume is included in this version.
*''The Thing''.  London: [[Tandem Books]] Limited, 1976; paperback.  Retitling of the 1952 Shasta edition of ''Who Goes There?''

==Other==
*''Empire''. New York: World Editions, 1951; paperback.  Written (and bylined) by [[Clifford D. Simak|Clifford Simak]] from Campbell's plot.  The book was apparently written by Campbell as a teenager; he was unable to find a publisher for it and turned it over to Simak to rewrite it for Astounding.  Simak said of the book that "''Empire'' was essentially a rewrite of John's plot.  I may have taken a few of the ideas and action, but I didn't use any of his words.  And I certainly tried to humanize his characters".  Simak's version was, ironically, rejected by Campbell, and finally appeared in the Galaxy Novel series from World Editions.&lt;ref name=Currey /&gt; Currey indicates here that the quote from Simak is "via Muriel Becker", without giving more details.  There is a Simak bibliography by Muriel R. Becker, which may be the source: ''Clifford D. Simak: A Primary and Secondary Bibliography''; Boston, [[G.K. Hall &amp; Co.]]; 1980.

The situation with regard to ''The Astounding Science Fiction Anthology'' and its reprints is confusing enough to warrant a separate discussion.  The original anthology, published by Simon &amp; Schuster in 1952, contained 23 stories, and an introduction by Campbell.  There have been three separate reissues of these stories in two volumes.  The first was done by Grayson &amp; Grayson, in 1954, as ''The First Astounding Science Fiction Anthology'' (seven stories) and ''The Second Science Fiction Anthology'' (eight stories).  This selection omitted the introduction (as did all the later editions) and also omitted eight of the stories.  Then in 1956 and 1957 Berkley issued two paperback selections.  The first, with serial number G-41, had the same title as the original, 'The Astounding Science Fiction Anthology', but included only eight stories.  This was re-released in 1967 under the title ''Selections From the Astounding Science Fiction Anthology''.  The second Berkley anthology, which had serial number G-47, was ''Astounding Tales of Space and Time''; this selected another seven stories; again eight stories were omitted, although not the same eight as omitted by the Grayson books: Berkley included five stories not printed in the Grayson versions of the anthology, and omitted five that Grayson did print.  Finally, in 1964 and 1965, Four Square printed a third version, again in two volumes, and with the same titles as the Grayson books: ''The First Astounding Science Fiction Anthology'' and ''The Second Astounding Science Fiction Anthology''.  The first volume contained eleven stories, and the second twelve stories; this version reprinted everything from the original 1952 one-volume edition except for Campbell's introduction.

It is the area given where the second Copper Scroll, containing a more detailed list, is buried.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jewishchristianlit.com/Texts/StudTxts/3Q15.html#fn6|title=Hack &amp; Carey: The Copper Scroll: 3Q15|publisher=|date=November 23, 1998|accessdate=17 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kohlit is also an area east of the Jordan River where [[Alexander Jannaeus]] had military campaigns. It is unknown whether this is the same Kohlit as the city.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14996">'''Language deprivation''' is associated with the lack of linguistic stimuli that are necessary for the [[language acquisition]] processes in an individual. Research has shown that early exposure to a first language will predict future language outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cummins|first1=Jim|title=The Relationship between American Sign Language and English|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/267559246_The_Relationship_between_American_Sign_Language_Proficiency_and_English_Academic_Development_A_Review_of_the_Research_1|website=Research Gate|accessdate=12 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Experiments involving language deprivation are very scarce due to the ethical controversy associated with it. Roger Shattuck, an American writer, called language deprivation research "The Forbidden Experiment" because it required the deprivation of a normal human.&lt;ref&gt;Shattuck, Roger (1994) [1980]. ''The Forbidden Experiment: The Story of the Wild Boy of Aveyron''. Kodansha International.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, experiments were performed by depriving animals of social stimuli to examine [[psychosis]].  Although there has been no formal experimentation on this topic, there are several cases of language deprivation. The combined research on these cases has furthered the research in the [[critical period hypothesis]] in language acquisition.

==Cases of language deprivation==

===Genie===
The most well-documented case of a language-deprived child was that of [[Genie (wild child)|Genie]]. Genie was discovered in 1971 in the family home, where she was recognized as highly abnormal. A social [[welfare agency]] took her into custody and admitted Genie into a hospital. Before discovery, Genie had lived strapped and harnessed into a chair. Genie, 13 years of age upon discovery, was malnourished, insensitive to tactile senses, and silent even upon being evoked; however she had proper social skills and she was able to maintain [[eye contact]] with caregivers, giving the impression that she understood instruction. After being discharged from the hospital she was put in [[foster care]] where she received "informal" training.

The first tests of language were taken three years after her discovery. She was given a variety of language test measures to test her sound skills, comprehension skills, and grammatical skills. She was able to discriminate between initial and final consonants.  However, she lacked pitch and volume control, her speech was described as high pitched and breathy with sound distortions, [[consonant cluster]]s, neutralizing vowels, dropping final consonants, and reducing consonants. She was able to comprehend instructions but was dependent on [[pantomime]] and gesture.  Genie was capable of discriminating affirmation from negative, [[comparative adjective]]s, and colour words. After four years of language stimulation, her linguistic performance was similar to that of a normal two-year-old infant. She had poor performance in complex sentences, interchangeably used the pronouns "you" and "me", and lacked the question form of sentence structure. Further studies were conducted focusing on the physiological state of Genie. She was right-handed but neurological tests showed that she processed her language in the right hemisphere. Normally right-handed people process language in the left hemisphere. She excelled in right-hemisphere processed tasks, such as [[face perception]], holistic recall of unrelated objects, and number perception.  Genie's language skills were deemed as poor, and this was linked to the notion that she began to learn language when she was 13¬Ω.&lt;ref&gt;Tartter, V. C. (1998). Language Processing in Atypical Populations. California: SAGE publications. pp. 113‚Äì121&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pines, M. (1981). The Civilizing of Genie. ''Psychology Today'', 15(9), 28. Accessed 3/11/2012&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kaspar Hauser===
Another case of language deprivation was of [[Kaspar Hauser]], who was kept in a dungeon in Germany until the age of 17. He did have some contact with humans during his isolation. Sources stated that he had a small amount of language; other sources state that upon discovery he spoke a garbled sentence. He was able to learn enough language to attempt to write an [[autobiography]] and to also become a legal clerk. However, five years after discovery he was stabbed to death.&lt;ref&gt;Tartter, V. C. (1998). Language Processing in Atypical Populations. California: SAGE publications. pp. 111‚Äì112&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anna===
Anna was born March 6, 1932, and was an [[illegitimate child]]. She was put in isolation by her mother because of this. Anna was kept tied to a chair and was malnourished due to being fed [[milk]] only. Upon discovery on February 6, 1938, she was sent to a county home. Further examination of Anna determined that she was very poor physiologically but that her senses were intact. During her stay at the county, she gained some [[body weight]] and began to build [[muscle]] in her body. She lived at the county home for nine months until she was moved to a foster home. Upon leaving she was still very unsocial, because there was no predetermined caregiver in the county home, which consisted of over 300 inmates and one nurse; often she was taken care of by inmates. The caregiver at the foster home used the same method to talk to Anna by which a mother would talk to their infant. During her tenure at the foster home she underwent some mental development and was similar to a one-year-old. After a year at the foster home she was sent to a school for defective children. Although she could not speak at the time, she had a comprehension of instructions.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, K. (1940) The Extreme Isolation of a Child. ''American Journal of Sociology'', 45(4), 554‚Äì565. Accessed 3/9/2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Isabelle===
Another case of a child deprived at a young age is that of Isabelle. Confined to a room with a [[deaf]] and [[muteness|mute]] mother, she spent 6¬Ω years in silence without any language stimulation. Upon discovery she was sent to a hospital where she was monitored for her apathetic behaviour. Now in a ward with children, she began to imitate other children in the ward to request attention. She had also begun language training. Eighteen months into her training her repertoire of words was estimated to be 1500‚Äì2500 words; she was also able to produce complex sentence structures. Throughout her training she began to use correct inflectional [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]], [[pronoun]]s, and [[preposition]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Tartter, V. C. (1998). Language Processing in Atypical Populations. California: SAGE publications. p. 113.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Feral children==
[[Feral child]]ren are children discovered by society to be living in the wild with the assumption that they were raised by animals. It is stated that such children are deprived of human associations and are too strongly conditioned with animal behaviours, such that the human development is permanently inhibited and the animal inhibitions are never lost throughout life. There are several known cases of feral children relearning language, the most well-known is Victor.&lt;ref&gt;Dennis, W. (1941) The Significance of a Feral Man. The American Journal of Psychology, 54(3), 425‚Äì432.&lt;/ref&gt; Victor was found at the age of 13 and was given to Dr. Itard, who "experimented" on the child. Victor was also known as the "[[Victor of Aveyron|wild boy of Aveyron]]". He was characterized to be insensitive to temperature, uncivilized and to run on all fours. Dr. [[Jean Marc Gaspard Itard]] conducted training over a period of 5 years, during which time Victor was able to recover some speech.&lt;ref&gt;Tartter, V. C. (1998). Language Processing in Atypical Populations. California: SAGE publications. p.104-111&lt;/ref&gt;

==Deaf Children==
Scientists suggest that the best guarantee of good language outcomes for Deaf children is to establish Sign Language as a secure first language before a cochlear implant program (CIP) is considered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmc=4201085 | pmid=25368567 | doi=10.3389/fnhum.2014.00834 | volume=8 | title=Cochlear implantation (CI) for prelingual deafness: the relevance of studies of brain organization and the role of first language acquisition in considering outcome success | year=2014 | journal=Front Hum Neurosci | page=834 | last1 = Campbell | first1 = R | last2 = MacSweeney | first2 = M | last3 = Woll | first3 = B}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because new hearing parents of deaf children are frequently{{when|date=May 2018}} advised by professionals without training in the field of [[Language acquisition by deaf children|language acquisition in deaf children]]{{dubious|date=May 2018}}, they are often{{weasel inline|date=May 2018}} advised to use sign as a last resort, only after the child has failed to learn spoken language{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}. This subjects these children to language deprivation in the time before they are exposed to accessible language input{{dubious|date=May 2018}}, which has been shown to increase the likelihood of permanent, irreversible effects to their brains. These effects include not only a detrimental impact on [[language acquisition]], but other cognitive and mental health difficulties as well&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hall|first=Wyatte C.|date=May 2017|title=What You Don't Know Can Hurt You: The Risk of Language Deprivation by Impairing Sign Language Development in Deaf Children |journal=Maternal and Child Health Journal|volume=21|issue=5|pages=961‚Äì965|doi=10.1007/s10995-017-2287-y |pmc=5392137|pmid=28185206|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

The effects of language deprivation in deaf children, like hearing children, can include permanently affecting their ability to ever achieve proficiency in a language. Deaf children who do not learn to sign until later in life are more likely to process signed languages not as linguistic input, but as visual input, contrasting with children exposed from birth, who process signed language in the same region of the brain in which hearing people process spoken language&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;. Additionally, studies show a notable decrease in sign language grammar skills of deaf adults who were not exposed to sign until after age 5 when compared to those exposed from birth, and an even greater decrease in those who were not exposed until after age 8, in some cases being so poor as to have near-coincidence levels of accuracy&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mayberry|first=Rachel I.|date=July 2007|title=When timing is everything: Age of first-language acquisition effects on second-language learning|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/applied-psycholinguistics/article/when-timing-is-everything-age-of-firstlanguage-acquisition-effects-on-secondlanguage-learning/3B1A8327FF0E7926F858FE995BEC3074|journal=Applied Psycholinguistics|language=en|volume=28|issue=3|pages=537‚Äì549|doi=10.1017/s0142716407070294|issn=1469-1817|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

This effect extends to spoken language as well. One study comparing [[English as a second or foreign language|English-as-a-second-language]] speakers showed that while deaf children who are signed to from birth have similar proficiency in spoken English to hearing ESL speakers, Deaf children who were not exposed to sign until entering school show a marked reduction in English proficiency. Note that this last group had been exposed to spoken English from birth; however, since auditory input was inaccessible to them, they failed to acquire spoken English as their first language, and therefore did not acquire language at all until learning ASL upon entering school&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;.{{Verify source|reason=deaf children who use listening and spoken language have English skills on par with their hearing peers, as cited above -- this assertion appears to be only about the small subset of deaf children who do not successfully use listening and spoken language, but the reference is unclear|date=May 2018}}

[[File:Farr.DE672.foley.webm|thumb|Dan Foley shares his personal experience of being deprived of language.]]
While [[Cochlear implant|Cochlear implants]] may help in making spoken first language acquisition more possible, this effect is unreliable; children with Cochlear implants exposed only to spoken language can still show a serious lack of spoken language ability when compared to hearing peers. In contrast, implanted children exposed to signing from birth, a more accessible medium of language, do not show this deficiency, despite having spoken language as their second language. This suggests that even when implanted, the period of language deprivation prior to implantation is enough to seriously impact a child's [[language development]]&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;.

=== Personal experiences ===
[[File:Farr.DE672.timothyskaggs.webm|thumb|Timothy Skaggs shares his personal experience of being deprived of language.]]
To further understand the language deprivation within the deaf and hard-of-hearing community, two personal videos collected based on two Deaf people's experiences with being deprived of language have been included on this page with subtitles. In one video, Dan Foley explains how he was deprived of language outside of his immediate family members, especially at school. It was not until later when he had access to a language that he could understand and apply to his education. His story helps us to get a better perspective on where language deprivation can happen, even at school. In another video, Timothy Skaggs explains his experience being deprived of language at home and school. He explains how deprived he was from incidental learning because he had no direct communication with anyone except for his interpreters at school. He missed out on family gatherings, social cues, and a normal childhood in general because he was always the last to know everything because of his limited access to spoken English. For more extended information on both stories, refer to the videos on this page. If you want to learn more about language deprivation in deaf and hard-of-hearing children, refer to this page: [[Language deprivation in deaf and hard of hearing children]].

==Research==

The "critical period of learning" hypothesis states that a person must be exposed to language by a certain age to acquire language. It is said to be associated with a period of increased [[neuroplasticity]]. It is also thought to end around the onset of puberty.&lt;ref&gt;Lenneberg, E.H. (1967) Biological Foundations of  Language. New York: Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fromkin, V., Krashen, S., Curtiss, S., Rigler, D., &amp; Rigler, M. (1974).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22171">The '''100 Books of the Century''' ({{lang-fr|Les cent livres du si√®cle}}) is a list of the one hundred best books of the 20th century, according to a poll conducted in the spring of 1999 by the French retailer [[Fnac]] and the Paris newspaper ''[[Le Monde]]''.

Starting from a preliminary list of 200 titles created by bookshops and journalists, 17,000 French voters responded to the question, "Which books have remained in your memory?" (''Quels livres sont rest√©s dans votre m√©moire ?'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.lemonde.fr/cgi-bin/ACHATS/acheter.cgi?offre=ARCHIVES&amp;type_item=ART_ARCH_30J&amp;objet_id=46796 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120527083227/http://www.lemonde.fr/cgi-bin/ACHATS/acheter.cgi?offre=ARCHIVES&amp;type_item=ART_ARCH_30J&amp;objet_id=46796 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=27 May 2012 |title=√âcrivains et choix sentimentaux |trans-title=Authors and sentimental choices |first=Josyane |last=Savigneau |author-link=Josyane Savigneau |newspaper=Le Monde |language=French |date=15 October 1999 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The list of acclaimed titles mixes great novels with poetry and theatre, as well as the [[Asterix the Gaul |Asterix]] comic book. The list includes many [[French novels]] because of the demographics of the surveyed group. However, similar lists by English language sources include US and UK authors only (for example, the [[Modern Library 100 Best Novels]] published in 1998, with two lists, one by the Board of the Modern Library and the other by readers who responded).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4589">'''Matth√§us Pr√§torius''' (c.1635&amp;ndash;c.1704) was a Protestant pastor, later a Roman Catholic priest, a historian and ethnographer.

Pr√§torius is thought to have been born in [[Klaipƒóda|Memel]] (Klaipƒóda).  He probably grew up speaking both [[German language|German]] and [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]], which helped him when preaching to the [[Prussian Lithuanians|ethnic Lithuanians]] in [[Ducal Prussia]]. His work about Prussia and its culture, ''Deliciae Prussicae, oder Preussische Schaub√ºhne'', resembles the work of [[Christoph Hartknoch]], with whom he collaborated. Pr√§torius' work provides much more ethnographic information regarding local Lithuanians and [[Old Prussians]]. It was only published partially, in 1871. A complete edition, in seven volumes, with original German text and Lithuanian translation, is under preparation in Lithuania.&lt;ref&gt;Jurate Rosales, Los godos, Barcelona: Ariel (2004), p√°g 26,32,328&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1701, having converted from [[Protestantism]] to [[Roman Catholicism]], he appealed against an ongoing case of [[witch-hunt]].  He died in [[Wejherowo]] (Weyherststadt).

In ''Orbis Gothicus'' and ''Mars Gothicus'' sustained that Prussia was the original land of [[Goths]] and that Goths can be identified as being "[[Old Prussians|prussians]], [[lithuanians]], [[samogitians]] and [[curonians]] [latvians]".&lt;ref&gt;Jurate Rosales, Los godos, Barcelona: Ariel (2004), p√°g 26,32,328&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[literature]], '''mood''' is the atmosphere of the narrative.  Mood is created by means of [[Setting (narrative)|setting]] (locale and surroundings in which the [[narrative]] takes place), [[Tone (literature)|attitude]] (of the narrator and of the [[Character (arts)|characters]] in the narrative), and [[description]]s.  Though atmosphere and setting are connected, they may be considered separately to a degree.  Atmosphere is the aura of mood that surrounds the story.  It is to [[fiction]] what the sensory level is to [[poetry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Turco|1999|p=50}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Mood is established in order to affect the reader emotionally and psychologically and to provide a feeling for the narrative.

==Elements==
Mood is generally created through several different things.
Setting, which provides the physical location of the story, is used in order to create a background in which the story takes place. Different settings can affect the mood of a story differently, and usually supports or conflicts with the other content of the story in some way. For example, the desert may be a setting for a [[cowboy]] story, and may generate a mood of solitude, desolation, and struggle, among other possible associations.
The attitude of the [[narrator]] is another element that helps generate mood. As the reader is dependent on the narrator's perspective of the story, they see the story through their lenses, feeling the way the narrator feels about what happens or what is being described. Embedded in the attitude of a narrator are the feelings and emotions which make it up. A similar element that goes into generating mood is [[diction]], that is, the choice and style of words the writer uses. Diction conveys a sensibility as well as portrays the content of a story in specific colors, thus affecting the way the reader feels about it.

==Difference from tone== 
[[Tone (literature)|Tone]] and mood are not the same. The tone of a piece of literature is the speaker's or narrator's attitude towards the subject, rather than what the reader feels, as in mood. Mood is the general feeling or atmosphere that a piece of writing creates within the reader.  Mood is produced most effectively through the use of setting, theme, [[Writer's voice|voice]] and tone. Tone can indicate the narrator's mood, but the overall mood comes from the totality of the written work, even in [[first-person narrative]]s. The effect a literary work has upon the reader is subjective and produces different associations, while the text made by the author is presented to the reader as an objective thing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.english-literature.org/essays/reader-response.php |title=The Author, the Text, and the Reader  |last=Lee Ai Ling |first=Clarissa |publisher=London School of Journalism |date=October 2002|website=English Literature |access-date=26 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mood is suggested by the elements utilized by the author, but relies on the subjective response from the reader.

[[File:Ruba'is by Hafiz - Nasta'liq script.jpg|thumb|some verses in Persian [[nasta'liq]] script, probably always a single page meant for a ''muraqqa''; 16-17th century]]

A '''Muraqqa''' ({{lang-tr|Murakka}}, {{lang-ar|ŸÖŸàÿ±ŸëŸÇÿ©}}, {{lang-fa|ŸÖŸèÿ±ŸéŸÇŸëÿπ}}) is an album in book form containing Islamic miniature paintings and specimens of [[Islamic calligraphy]], normally from several different sources, and perhaps other matter.  The album was popular among collectors in the Islamic world, and by the later 16th century became the predominant format for miniature painting in the Persian [[Safavid]], [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] and [[Ottoman empire]]s, greatly affecting the direction taken by the painting traditions of the [[Persian miniature]], [[Ottoman miniature]] and [[Mughal miniature]].&lt;ref&gt;Froom. (2001), 1.; Rizvi, 800&lt;/ref&gt;  The album largely replaced the full-scale illustrated manuscript of classics of [[Persian poetry]], which had been the typical vehicle for the finest miniature painters up to that time.  The great cost and delay of commissioning a top-quality example of such a work essentially restricted them to the ruler and a handful of other great figures, who usually had to maintain a whole workshop of calligraphers, artists and other craftsmen, with a librarian to manage the whole process.  An album could be compiled over time, page by page, and often included miniatures and pages of calligraphy from older books that were broken up for this purpose, and allowed a wider circle of collectors access to the best painters and calligraphers, although they were also compiled by, or presented to, shahs and emperors.  The earliest ''muraqqa'' were of pages of calligraphy only; it was at the court in [[Herat]] of the [[Timurid dynasty|Timurid]] prince [[Baysunghur]] in the early 15th century that the form became important for miniature painting.  The word ''muraqqa'' means "that which has been patched together" in [[Farsi|Persian]].&lt;ref&gt;Froom, 1-2; Thackston, vii&lt;/ref&gt;

The works in an album, typically of different original sizes, were trimmed or mounted on standard size pages, often with new border decoration being added. When the compilation was considered complete it was bound, often very luxuriously, with an [[Islamic book-cover]] that might be highly decorated with [[lacquer]]ed paint, gold stamping on leather, or other techniques.  Other ''muraqqa'' might be bound in a special [[concertina]]-like form.  Many were arranged with pages of calligraphy facing miniatures, the matching of verse to image allowing some scope for the creativity of the compiler.&lt;ref&gt;A regular theme of prefaces - see Roxburgh, 111-112&lt;/ref&gt;  Albums containing only calligraphy tended to be arranged chronologically to show the development of a style.  The bindings of many albums allowed items to be added and removed, or they were just removed from the centre of the page, and such changes were often made; some albums had marks which allow changes to be traced.&lt;ref&gt;Froom, 5-6&lt;/ref&gt; The grandest albums had specially written prefaces which are the source of a high proportion of surviving contemporary writing on the arts of the book, and the biographies of painters and calligraphers; these tended to be written by calligraphers.  For calligraphers too the single page for an album became the "bread and butter" source of income,&lt;ref&gt;Canby, quote on 47&lt;/ref&gt; using mostly texts from poetry, whether extracts from a long classic or [[ghazal]] lyrics, but sometimes an extract from the [[Qur'an]], perhaps given the place of honour at the start of the album.  Album pages often have areas of [[Ottoman illumination|decorated illumination]] (as in the illustration) that share their motifs with other media, notably book-covers and carpet designs, the best of which were in fact probably mostly produced by the same type of artist at court, and sent to the weavers.&lt;ref&gt;Canby, 42-49, 45 on Qur'an, 83 on carpets.&lt;/ref&gt;

While the classic Islamic [[illuminated manuscript]] tradition had concentrated on rather crowded scenes with strong narrative content as illustrations in full texts of classic and lengthy works like the ''[[Shahnameh]]'' and the ''[[Khamsa of Nizami]]'', the single miniature intended from the start for a ''muraqqa'' soon developed as a simpler scene with fewer, larger, figures, often showing idealized beauties of either sex in a garden setting, or genre figures from nomadic life, usually with no real or fictional identities attached to them.  In Mughal India realistic portraiture, nearly always of rulers or courtiers, became a very common feature, and in Ottoman Turkey portraits of the Sultans, often very stylised, were a particular speciality.  Fully coloured scenes tended to give way to part-drawn and part-painted ones, or to figures with little or no background.  The album to some extent overlaps with the anthology, a collection of different pieces where the main emphasis is on the texts, but which can also include paintings and drawings inserted from different sources.

==Shift to the album==

===Persia===
The dominant tradition of miniature painting in the late [[Middle Ages]] was that of [[Persia]], which had a number of centres, but all usually dependent on one key patron, whether the shah himself, or a figure either governing a part of the country from a centre such as [[Herat]], where Baysunghur was an important patron in the early 15th century, or the ruler of a further part of the [[Persianate]] world in a centre like [[Bukhara]].  As the [[Safavid dynasty]] centralized Persian rule in the 16th century the number of potential partrons of a full-size atelier declined, but the atelier of the shah expanded and produced a number of superb illustrated books, using a variety of very talented artists on each.  However, in the 1540s Shah [[Tahmasp I]], previously a keen patron, lost interest in commissioning books, and thereafter the Persian miniature painting tradition lacked a steady source of commissions for books in the old style.  After a gap of some years, Tahmasp's nephew [[Ibrahim Mirza]] established an atelier at [[Mashad]], which produced the [[Freer Jami]] in the 1560s, and which Shah [[Ismail II of Persia|Ismail II]] took over after having its former patron killed in 1577.  But Ismail's reign was very brief, and thereafter consistent large-scale patronage was lacking.  It was in this period that the single miniature designed for inserting in an album came to be dominant; such works had long been produced, but now they became the main source of income for many artists, who probably often produced them speculatively with no commission, and then looked to sell them (little is known about the market for album miniatures).&lt;ref&gt;Titley, 113-114; Riza; Brend, 165-166&lt;/ref&gt;

The artist who epitomises the Persian album miniature is [[Riza Abbasi]], active from the 1580s until his death in 1635, whose early single miniatures of groups are somewhat like those in narrative scenes, but lacking any actual narrative attached to them.  He soon turned to, and developed, subjects mostly of one or two figures, often portrait-like, although very few identities are given or were probably ever intended to be recognised. There are a large number of beautiful youths, to whose clothes great attention is paid.&lt;ref&gt;Riza&lt;/ref&gt;

===Turkey===
[[File:Sarayi Album 145ba.jpg|thumb|15th century portrait of [[Mehmet II]] (1432-1481), showing Italian influence]]
The best Ottoman painting was heavily concentrated in the capital, which from 1453 was [[Istanbul]], and the most important patron was always the Sultan.  The royal library remains very largely intact in Turkey, mostly at [[Topkapi Palace]], and was greatly enriched by Persian manuscripts, initially taken during the several Ottoman invasions of eastern Persia, and later, after a treaty in 1555, often received as [[diplomatic gift]]s.  Many of these manuscripts were broken up to use the miniatures in albums.&lt;ref&gt;Titley, 133-135&lt;/ref&gt;  Persian artists were imported from virtually the start of the Ottoman tradition, but especially in the 16th century; sixteen artists were brought back just from the brief Ottoman conquest of [[Tabriz]] in 1514, though by 1558 the palace records list only nine foreign artists of all kinds, against twenty-six Turks. But a distinctively Ottoman style can be seen from the start of the 16th century, with pictures showing simpler landscape backgrounds, more sea and ships, neatly tented army camps, distant cityscapes, more individual characterization of faces, but also a less refined technique.  There was strong European influence, mostly from [[Venice]], but this was restricted to portraiture.&lt;ref&gt;Titley, 136-142&lt;/ref&gt;

Turkish albums include mixtures of collected miniatures similar to those in Persia, and often including Persian pieces, with the addition of rather more greatly elaborated pen drawings of an essentially decorative nature, of a foliage motif, or a bird or animal treated largely as such.  Albums dedicated to the sultans, with portraits and laudatory pieces of text, are a distinctive Turkish type, and there were also albums of scenes of Turkish life, showing the relatively uniform costume of different ranks in society, methods of torture and execution, and other scenes of interest to the mostly Western foreigners they were produced for, matching similar [[Old master print|prints]] made in contemporary Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Titley, 151, 157-158&lt;/ref&gt;

One very distinctive type of miniature is found only in Ottoman albums, though they may have been brought from Persia as booty, and perhaps were not intended for albums originally.  These are eighty or so the mysterious and powerful images grouped under the name of [[Siyah Qalam]], meaning "Black Pen" (or drunk or evil pen), full of demons and scenes which suggest nomadic life in Central Asia, though it has also been suggested that they come from a single Persian court artist letting himself go.  They are perhaps from the early 15th century, reaching Turkey in the 16th.&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, 37; Walther &amp; Wolf, 254-255&lt;/ref&gt;

Another distinctive type of Ottoman work is the [[d√©coupage]] or cut paper miniature, where different colours of paper, cut with minute detail then pasted together, are used to create the image.  This technique was used for book-covers in Timurid Persia, which were then varnished over for protection, but in Turkey the images were treated as miniatures and went inside albums; the technique was also much used for page border decoration.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/me/a/a_lion_attacking_a_deer.aspx ''A lion attacking a deer'', stencilled scene of d√©coupage paper shapes] British Museum; Titley, 158, 229, 242&lt;/ref&gt;

===Indian subcontinent===

The [[Mughal dynasty]] in the [[Indian subcontinent]] was rather later in establishing a large court atelier, which did not begin until after the exile in Persia of the second emperor, [[Humayun]], who on his return was joined from about 1549 by Persian artists including [[Abd as-Samad]].  The Mughal style developed under the next emperor, [[Akbar]], who commissioned some very large illustrated books, but his artists produced single miniatures for albums as well.  In the case of the [[Jahangirnama]], the emperor [[Jahangir]] kept a diary and commissioned paintings separately, which were most likely held in the [[Kitabkhana]] (‡§ï‡§ø‡§§‡§æ‡§¨‡§ñ‡§æ‡§®‡§æ), until his official contribution to the court chronicle genre could be assembled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=T_QNAQAAMAAJ|title=The Jahangirnama|last=Freer Gallery of Art and the Arthur M.

For a long time portraits were always of men, often accompanied by generalized female servants or [[concubine]]s; but there is scholarly debate about the representation of female court members in portraiture. Some scholars claim there are no known extant likenesses of figures like [[Jahanara Begum]] and [[Mumtaz Mahal]], and others attribute miniatures, for example from the [[Dara Shikoh]] album or the [[Freer Gallery of Art]] mirror portrait, to these famous noblewomen.&lt;ref&gt;Crill and Jariwala, 23-30&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=BDl3MAEACAAJ&amp;dq=the+mughal+empire,+art+culture+and+empire|title=Mughal India: Art, Culture and Empire Manuscripts and Paintings in the British Library|last=Losty|first=J.P.|last2=Roy|first2=Malini|publisher=The British Library|year=2012|isbn=9780712358705|location=London|pages=132‚Äì133}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Abid.

F2005.4 [http://www.asia.si.edu/collections/edan/object.php?q=fsg_F2005.4&amp;bcrumb=true]&lt;/ref&gt; Another popular subject area was realistic studies of animals and plants, mostly flowers; from the 17th century equestrian portraits, mostly of rulers, became another popular borrowing from the West.&lt;ref&gt;Crill and Jariwala, 68&lt;/ref&gt;  The single idealized figure of the Riza Abbasi type was less popular, but fully painted scenes of lovers in a palace setting became popular later.  Drawings of genre scenes, especially showing holy men, whether Muslim or Hindu, were also popular.

Akbar had an album, now dispersed, consisting entirely of portraits of figures at his enormous court which had a practical purpose; according to chroniclers he used to consult it when discussing appointments and the like with his advisors, apparently to jog his memory of who the people being discussed were.  Many of them, like medieval European images of saints, carried objects associated with them to help identification, but otherwise the figures stand on a plain background.&lt;ref&gt;Crill and Jariwala, 66&lt;/ref&gt; There are a number of fine portraits of Akbar, but it was under his successors [[Jahangir]] and Shah Jahan that the portrait of the ruler became firmly established as a leading subject in Indian miniature painting, which was to spread to both Muslim and Hindu princely courts across India.&lt;ref&gt;Crill and Jariwala, 27-39, and catalogue entries&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 18th and 19th centuries Indian artists working in the hybrid Indo-European [[Company style]] produced albums of miniatures for Europeans living in India as part of the [[British Raj]] and its French and Portuguese equivalents.  Some Europeans collected or were given earlier Indian miniatures; the Large and Small Clive albums were presented to [[Lord Clive]], and are now in the [[Victoria &amp; Albert Museum]] in London.&lt;ref&gt;[https://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O86414/painting-a-flower-study/ Small Clive album] [[Victoria &amp; Albert Museum]].&lt;/ref&gt;  Others created albums of new work, tending to concentrate on animal portraits and the houses, horses and other possessions of this wealthy group.  In the 19th century images of Indians and their costumes, often categorized by regional and ethnic type, or occupation, became very popular.  Large-scale patrons included Colonel [[James Skinner (soldier)|James Skinner]] of Skinner's Horse fame, who had a [[Rajput]] mother, and for natural history paintings, [[Mary Impey]], wife of [[Elijah Impey]], who commissioned over three hundred, and the [[Richard Wellesley, 1st Marquess Wellesley|Marquess Wellesley]], brother of the [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|first Duke of Wellington]], who had over 2,500 miniatures.

==Use of albums==

Albums were often presented as gifts to mark a milestone in life.  Chroniclers record that when the Persian Prince [[Ibrahim Mirza]] was killed in 1577, on the orders of Shah [[Tahmasp I]], his wife, Tahmasp's sister, destroyed artworks including an album containing miniatures by [[KamƒÅl ud-Dƒ´n BehzƒÅd|Behzad]] among others, which her husband had compiled and given her for their wedding, washing the miniatures in water.&lt;ref&gt;Titley, 105&lt;/ref&gt;  Perhaps she did not want anything to fall into the hands of her brother, who had ordered his death, and who did take over the prince's atelier.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.akdn.org/museum/detail.asp?artifactid=1731 Aga Khan Museum] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724231354/http://www.akdn.org/museum/detail.asp?artifactid=1731 |date=2011-07-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Albums were often presented to rulers on their accession, or in Turkey at New Year. They could also be given as diplomatic gifts between rulers.&lt;ref&gt;Tanidi, 1&lt;/ref&gt;

A muraqqa was created for Sultan [[Murad III]] in 1572 when he ascended to the throne, which is unusual because the dedication is very detailed, including the date and place of creation, namely Istanbul, 980 AH/1572-73 AD.&lt;ref&gt;A. E.Froom, (2001). "Collecting Tastes: A Muraqqa‚Äô for Sultan Murad III". Electronic Journal of Oriental Studies IV: 19, pp. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; The dedication is to Murad III, also naming his compiler Mehmed Cenderecizade. The Murad III muraqqa was designed much more extravagantly than other Islamic muraqqa and with original nakkashane (Ottoman painting studio) border paintings.&lt;ref&gt;Emine F. Fetvaci, (2005). "Viziers to Eunuchs: Transitions in Ottoman Manuscript Patronage, 1566--1617." Unpublished PhD Dissertation, Harvard University. pp. 28.&lt;/ref&gt; This muraqqa contained miniature paintings, ink drawings, and calligraphy, including [[ghazals]].  The Murad III muraqqa has twenty-four miniatures created in the cities of [[Bukhara]] to the east of Persia, [[Tabriz]], [[Isfahan]], and [[Qazvin]] in Persia, and [[Istanbul]] between the late fifteenth and seventeenth centuries.&lt;ref&gt;A. E.Froom, (2001). "Collecting Tastes: A Muraqqa‚Äô for Sultan Murad III". Electronic Journal of Oriental Studies IV: 19, p. 2, 7.&lt;/ref&gt;  It has a two-page introduction written in Persian, which is similar in structure to [[Timurid dynasty|Timurid]] and [[Safavid]] album prefaces, and indicates that this muraqqa was compiled in Istanbul less than two years before Murad III became Sultan.&lt;ref&gt;E.Froom, (2001).

Another album in the Ottoman royal collection contains only Western images, mostly [[old master print|prints]] but including a drawing in pen of an ''Ornamental Scroll with [[Putti]] and Penises'', "for the merriment of adult guests at a dinner in [[Beyoƒülu|Pera]]".  The collection was probably assembled for a [[Florence|Florentine]] in the late 15th century, probably a merchant living in Istanbul (where Pera was the quarter for Westerners).  The other 15 images are a mixed group of Florentine [[engraving]]s, mostly unique impressions (i.e. otherwise unknown), with some religious subjects and a coloured print of [[Mehmet II]], who apparently acquired the album.  It is of interest to art historians because only a small handful of early albums of Western prints survive anywhere, having been broken up by later collectors or dealers; they were probably common among collectors in Europe at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Landau &amp; Parshall, 91-95; one might query the title, as the "putti" are rather rough-looking adults.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Examples from the Mughal Court ===

* ''The Salim album'', produced in the reign of [[Akbar the Great]], contains both Christian images and portraits of Hindu courtiers.
* ''The Minto Albums'', from the reign of [[Shah Jahan]], contains miniatures depicting royal courtiers, gardens, and images of wildlife, surrounded by elaborate floral borders.
* ''The Shah Jahan Album'', now dispersed, as it was split up by Demotte, a European dealer.

== In modern times  ==
[[Abdur Rahman Chughtai]] was a painter who was responsible for the revival of the muraqqa in [[Pakistan]] in 1928 after publishing his Muraqqa-I Chughtai. When he started painting in the 1910s his major influence was [[Hindu mythology]], but by the 1920s he was inspired by Islamic artwork including the muraqqa, [[ghazals]], and [[Ottoman miniature]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Iftikhar Dadi, (2006). "Miniature Painting as Muslim Cosmopolitanism" ISIM Review: International Institute for the Study of Islam in the Modern World. No. 18 pp. 53. 
&lt;/ref&gt;

Using the emergent tools of [[digital humanities]], Sumathi Ramaswamy at [[Duke University]] has recreated the form of a Mughal muraqqa‚Äô to track the itineraries of the [[terrestrial globe]] in early modern [[India]].&lt;ref&gt;Sumathi Ramaswamy, ‚ÄòGoing Global in Mughal India‚Äô (http://sites.duke.edu/globalinmughalindia/)&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''parody religion''' or '''mock religion''' is a [[belief system]] that challenges spiritual convictions of others, often through humor, [[satire]], or [[burlesque]] (literary ridicule). Often created to achieve a specific purpose related to another belief system, a parody religion can be a parody of several religions, [[sect]]s, [[guru]]s, [[cult]]s, or [[new religious movement]]s at the same time or even a parody of no particular religion, instead parodying the concept of [[religious belief]] itself. In some parody religions, the emphasis is on having fun; the faith may be a convenient excuse for pleasant social interaction among the like-minded.

One approach to parody religion aims to highlight deficiencies in particular pro-religious arguments ‚Äî the thinking being that if a given argument can also be used to support a clear parody, then the original argument is [[proving too much|clearly flawed]]. An example of this is the [[Flying Spaghetti Monster]], which parodies the equal time argument employed by [[intelligent design]] and [[creationism]].&lt;ref name=FSM&gt;{{cite news|title='Spaghetti Monster' is noodling around with faith|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/books/2006-03-26-spaghetti-monster_x.htm|accessdate=2013-10-03|newspaper=USA Today|date=26 March 2006|author=Dan Vergano}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Occasionally, a parody religion may offer [[ordination mill|ordination by mail or on-line]] at a nominal fee, seeking equal recognition for this clergy under [[freedom of religion]] provisions, including the [[First Amendment|1st]] and [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|14th]] amendments to the [[United States Constitution]]. A few US states have permitted [[The Church of the Latter-Day Dude]]&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/29/fashion/weddings/david-kantor-michael-hampton.html&lt;/ref&gt; or Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.startribune.com/local/east/280267352.html|title=Atheists sue Washington County over denial to perform marriages|publisher=Star-Tribune}}&lt;/ref&gt; officiants to legally solemnise marriage. Parody religions also have sought the same [[reasonable accommodation]] legally afforded to mainstream religions, including religious-specific garb or headgear.&lt;ref name=FSM_official/&gt;

Several religions that are classified as parody religions have a number of relatively serious followers who embrace the perceived absurdity of these religions as spiritually significant, a decidedly [[post-modern]] approach to religion. For instance, in [[Discordianism]], it can be hard to tell whether even these "serious" followers are not just taking part in an even bigger joke.

| [[Church of Euthanasia]]
| The Church of Euthanasia is a "non-profit educational foundation devoted to restoring balance between Humans and the remaining species on Earth." The Church uses sermons, music, culture jamming, publicity stunts and direct action to highlight Earth's unsustainable population. The Church is notorious for its conflicts with Pro-life Christian activists.

| [[Church of the SubGenius]]
| Founded in 1979. Often regarded as a parody of religion in general, with elements of fundamentalist Christianity, Zen, Scientology, new-age cults, pop-psychology, and motivational sales techniques amongst others, it has become a movement in its own right, inspiring several books, art exhibits, rock albums, conventions, and novelty items.

|-
| [[Dinkoism]]
| Dinkoism is a parody religion that places [[Dinkan]], a comic character from [[Malayalam]] Children's magazine [[Balamangalam]], as the one true God and the creator of the Universe. It is very similar to Pastafarianism that worships [[The Flying Spaghetti Monster]]. Dinkoism was organized by some independent social welfare groups of [[Kerala]], India as a means to mock blind faith and creatively criticise religious intolerance. It had its origins in the social media. Its principal deity is also Dinkan.

|-
| [[Epicureanism]]
| The philosophical school founded by [[Epicurus of Samos]] often behaves like a parody religion. Ancient Epicureans celebrated a feast on the twentieth of each month as a philosophical alternative to the common devotions of the day, and frequently pitied and mocked the beliefs of common folk. In ''[[A True Story]]'', Epicurean satirist [[Lucian of Samosata]] imitated the common religious convention of reserving right to entry into heaven when he invented a paradise called "Isle of the Blessed" where only Epicureans and their allies were allowed, and comically explained how members of other philosophical schools failed to find their way to it.

Many atheists, including [[Richard Dawkins]], use parody religions such as those of the [[Flying Spaghetti Monster]] and the [[Invisible Pink Unicorn]] ‚Äî as well as ancient gods like [[Zeus]] and [[Thor]] ‚Äî as modern versions of [[Russell's teapot]] to argue that the burden of proof is on the believer, not the atheist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | last = Dawkins| first = Richard| authorlink = Richard Dawkins| title = The God Delusion  | year = 2006| publisher = Bantam| location = London| isbn = 978-0-593-05548-9| chapter = Chapter 2: The God Hypothesis}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dawkins also created a parody of the criticism of atheism, coining the term ''athorism'', or the firm belief that the [[Norse mythology|Norse]] deity [[Thor]] does not exist. The intention is to emphasize the claim that [[atheism]] is not a form of religious creed, but instead merely denial of beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Dawkins |last=Richard |authorlink=Richard Dawkins |title=Let's Hope It's A Lasting Vogue |work=On Faith |publisher=Newsweek |url=http://www.faithstreet.com/onfaith/2007/01/01/athorism-is-enjoying-a-certain/5693 |accessdate=2016-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A common challenge against atheism is the idea that atheism is itself a form of "faith", a belief without proof. The theist might say [[Falsifiability|"No one can ''prove'' that God ''does not'' exist, therefore an atheist is exercising faith by asserting that there is no God."]] Dawkins argues that by replacing the word "God" with "Thor" one should see that the assertion is fallacious. The burden of proof, he claims, rests upon the believer in the supernatural, not upon the non-believer who considers such things unlikely. Athorism is an attempt to [[argumentum ad absurdum|illustrate through absurdity]] that there is no logical difference between disbelieving particular religions.

The '''Plain of Jars''' ([[Laotian language|Lao]]: ‡∫ó‡∫ª‡ªà‡∫á‡ªÑ‡∫´‡∫´‡∫¥‡∫ô {{IPA-lo|t ∞≈ç≈ã h«éj h«ên|}}) is a [[megalithic]] archaeological landscape in [[Laos]]. It consists of thousands of stone jars scattered around the upland valleys and the lower foothills of the central plain of the [[Xiangkhoang Plateau]]. The jars are mostly arranged in clusters ranging in number from one to several hundred.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Marwick |first1=Ben |last2=Bouasisengpaseuth |first2=Bounheung |title=The History and Practice of Archaeology in Laos |journal=Handbook of East and Southeast Asian Archaeology |date=2017 |pages=89‚Äì95 |doi=10.1007/978-1-4939-6521-2_8 |url=https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/75zhc/ |publisher=Springer New York |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Xieng Khouang Plateau is located at the northern end of the [[Annamese Cordillera]], the principal mountain range of [[Indochina]]. French researcher [[Madeleine Colani]] concluded in 1930 that the jars were associated with prehistoric burial practices. Excavation by Lao and Japanese archaeologists in the intervening years has supported this interpretation with the discovery of human remains, burial goods and ceramics around the jars. The Plain of Jars is dated to the [[Iron Age#Southeast Asia|Iron Age]] (500 BC to AD 500) and is one of the most important prehistoric sites in Southeast Asia.

==The jar sites==

More than 90 jar sites have been identified within [[Xiangkhouang Province]]. Each site has from one to 400 stone jars. The jars vary in height and diameter between 1m and 3m and are all [[Hewing|hewn]] from rock. Their shape is cylindrical with the bottom always wider than the top.&lt;ref&gt;Sayavongkhamdy, T., Bellwood, P., &amp; Bulbeck, D. (2000). Recent archaeological research in Laos. Bulletin of the Indo-Pacific Prehistory Association, 19,&lt;/ref&gt; The stone jars are undecorated, with the exception of a single jar at Site 1. This jar has a human "frogman" bas-relief carved on the exterior. Parallels between the "frogman" and the rock painting at [[Rock Paintings of Hua Mountain|Huashan]] in Guangxi, China have been drawn. The Chinese paintings, which depict large full-frontal images of humans with arms raised and knees bent, are dated to 500 BC‚Äì200 AD.

Since most of the jars have lip rims, it is thought that the jars originally supported lids, although few stone lids have been recorded; this may suggest that the bulk of lids were fashioned from perishable materials. Stone lids with animal carvings have been found at few sites such as Ban Phakeo (Site 52). The bas-relief carvings are thought to depict monkeys, tigers and frogs. 
[[File:PoJ-site_1-3.JPG|PlainOfJarsView3|thumb|300px|left|Plain of Jars ‚Äì Jar with lid]]

Stone discs have also been found. The discs, which differ from the lids, have at least one flat side and are grave markers which were placed on the surface to cover or mark a burial pit. These grave markers appear more infrequently than jars, but are found in close proximity. Similar are stone grave markers; these stones are unworked, but have been placed intentionally to mark a grave. To the north of Xieng Khouang an extensive network of intentionally placed largely unworked stones marking elaborate burial pits and chambers are known as "standing stones of [[Houaphanh Province|Huaphan]]". These have been dated to the [[Bronze Age]].

The jars lie in clusters on the lower footslopes and mountain ridges of the hills surrounding the central plateau and upland valleys. Several quarry sites have been recorded, usually close to the jar sites. Five rock types have been identified: [[sandstone]], [[granite]], [[conglomerate (geology)|conglomerate]], [[limestone]] and [[breccia]].

The majority of the jars are sandstone. It is assumed that Plain of Jars' people used iron chisels to manufacture the jars, although no conclusive evidence for this exists. Regional differences in jar shape have been noted. While the differences in most cases can be attributed to choice and manipulation of rock source, some differences in form (such as variations in the placement of jar apertures) appear to be unique to specific sites.

A cave located at Site 1 is a natural limestone formation with an opening to the northwest and two man-made holes at the top. These holes are thought to be chimneys for a crematorium. French geologist and amateur archaeologist [[Madeleine Colani]] excavated inside the cave in the early 1930s and found material to support a crematorium theory. Colani also recorded and excavated at 12 Plain of Jars sites and published two volumes with her findings in 1935. Colani concluded that the Plain of Jars was an Iron Age burial site. Inside the jars she found, embedded in black organic soil, coloured [[Glass beadmaking|glass beads]], burnt teeth and bone fragments, sometimes from more than one individual. Around the stone jars, she found human bones, pottery fragments, iron and bronze objects, glass and stone beads, ceramic weights and charcoal. The bone and teeth inside the jars show signs of [[cremation]], while the burials surrounding the jars yield unburnt secondary burial bones.

[[File:PlainOfJarsView.JPG|PlainOfJarsView2|thumb|300px|left|Plain of Jars ‚Äì Site One]]
No further archaeological research was conducted until November 1994, when Professor Eiji Nitta of the [[Kagoshima University]] and Lao archaeologist Thongsa Sayavongkhamdy surveyed and mapped Site 1. Nitta claimed that the surrounding burial pits were contemporaneous to the jars, as they had been cut into the surface on which the jars had been placed. Nitta believed the jars were symbolic monument to mark the surrounding burials. He dated the Plain of Jars to the late second or early first millennium B.C. based on the burial urn and associated [[grave goods]]. Sayavongkhamdy undertook surveys and excavations between 1994 and 1996, supported by the [[Australian National University]]. Sayavongkhamdy and [[Peter Bellwood]] interpreted the stone jars as a central person's primary or secondary burial, surrounded by secondary burials of family members. Archaeological data collected during bomb clearance operations supervised by [[UNESCO]] archaeologist Julie Van Den Bergh in 2004‚Äì2005 and again in 2007 provided similar archaeological results. Like Nitta, Van Den Bergh concluded that the jars and surrounding burials were contemporaneous.

Variations in the practices of cremation inside jars and secondary burial outside jars, as noted by Colani, have proven difficult to explain. The cremated remains seem to mainly belong to adolescents. While the bomb clearance operations did not involve emptying of jars and thus no additional evidence could be gathered, Van Den Bergh claimed that the stone jars initially may have been used to distil the dead bodies and that the cremated remains within the jars represent the most recent phase in Plain of Jars. The jars with smaller apertures may reflect the diminishing need to place an entire body inside.

The suggestion that the jars, in a similar fashion to traditional Southeast Asian Royal mortuary practices, functioned as 'distilling vessels', was put forward by R. Engelhardt and P. Rogers in 2001. In contemporary funerary practices followed by Thai, Cambodian and Laotian royalty, the corpse of the deceased is placed into an urn during the early stages of the funeral rites, at which time the soul of deceased is believed to be undergoing gradual transformation from the earthly to the spiritual world. The ritual decomposition is later followed by cremation and secondary burial.

Incidentally, the megalithic Dravidians of South India used giant burial urns called Mudhumakkal Thazhi (burial-pots-of-the-old-people) or EemaThazhi.  These funerary urns were buried with the bodies of the deceased or soon-to-die in a sitting posture, along with their personal goods and ornaments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Sumathi, Saigan Connection |url=http://www.saigan.com/heritage/swaminathan/sittannavasal/megalith.html |title=Indian Heritage - Swmainathan - Sittannavasal - The Megalithic burial sites |website=Saigan.com |date= |accessdate=2016-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This practice was in vogue until 200 AD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phenomenalplace.com/2014/05/mudhumakkal-thazhi-ancient-funeral.html |title=Mudhumakkal Thazhi - The Ancient Funeral System Of Tamils ~ Places on the planet you must see |website=Phenomenalplace.com |date= |accessdate=2016-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The royal burials are located across watercourses from the habitation areas in a geographically high, prominent area. Among the [[Black Thai]] people who have been in the region at least since the 11th century, the upper classes are cremated in the belief that it will release their spirits to heaven, while commoners are buried, leaving their spirits to remain on Earth.

Colani connected the location of the jars sites to ancient trade routes, in particular with the [[salt trade]]. She assumed that salt was a commodity sought after by the Plain of Jars people, which brought traders to the Xieng Khouang Plateau. The Xieng Khouang area is rich in metallic minerals, mainly due to granite intrusions and associated hydrothermal activity.

Two principal iron ore deposits exist in Laos, both in Xieng Khouang. The presence and locations of the numerous jar sites in Xieng Khouang may relate to trading and mining activities. History has shown that Xieng Khouang, at the northern end of the [[Annamite Range]], provides relative easy passage from the north and east to the south and west.

Within the geographic setting of Xieng Khouang, the jar sites may reflect a network of intercultural villages, whereby the locations of the jars are associated with long-distance overland routes which connect the [[Mekong]] basin and the [[Gulf of Tonkin]] System. The jar sites show superficial regional differences, such as jar form, material, and the number of jars per site. But all share common setting characteristics such as burial practices, elevated locations, and commanding views over the surrounding area.

The most investigated and visited Jar site is located close to the town of [[Phonsavan]], and is known as Site 1. Seven jar sites have now been cleared of unexploded bombs and are open to visitors. These are currently sites 1, 2 and 3, and Site 16 near the Old Capital Xieng Khouang; Site 23, near the big hot spring in [[Muang Kham, Laos|Muang Kham]]; Site 25 in the largely unvisited [[Phou Kout District]]; and Site 52, the largest known jar site to date with 392 jars near a traditional [[Hmong people|Hmong]] village only accessible by foot.

==Legends and local history==
[[Image:plainofjars 1.jpg|thumb|[[Hmong people|Hmong]] girls climbing on one of the jars at Site 1]]
Lao legends tell of a race of giants who inhabited the area and who were ruled by a king, named [[Khun Cheung]], who fought a long and ultimately victorious battle against an enemy. He supposedly created the jars to brew and store huge amounts of ''[[lau hai]]'' ("lau" means "alcohol", "hai" means "jar"‚ÄîSo "lau hai" means [[rice beer]] or [[rice wine]] in the jars) to celebrate his victory. Another local story states that the jars were molded from natural materials including clay, sand, sugar, and animal products in a type of stone mix. This led the locals to believe the cave at Site 1 was actually a kiln, and that the jars were fired there and are not actually hewn from stone.

Another suggested explanation for the jars' use is to collect [[monsoon]] rainwater for caravan travelers along their journey at times when rain may have been seasonal and water was not readily available on the easiest footpaths. Rainwater would then be boiled, even if stagnant, to become potable again, a practice long understood in Eastern [[Eurasia]]. The trade caravans that camped around these jars could have placed beads inside them as offerings, accompanying prayers for rain. Or the beads might simply have been unassociated lost items.

==Current situation==
Between 1964 and 1973, the Plain of Jars was heavily bombed by the U.S. Air Force (see [[Laotian Civil War|Secret War]]) operating against North Vietnamese and [[Pathet Lao]] communist forces. The U.S. Air Force dropped more bombs on Laos, primarily the Plain of Jars, than it dropped during the whole of [[World War II]]. This included 262 million anti-personnel [[cluster bomb]]s. An estimated 80 million of these did not explode and remain a deadly threat to the population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Ian MacKinnon |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/dec/03/laos-cluster-bombs-uxo-deaths |title=Forty years on, Laos reaps bitter harvest of the secret war &amp;#124; World news |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date= |accessdate=2016-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20081003124143/http://www.maginternational.org/laopdr ]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20101126193110/http://maginternational.org/where-we-work/mag-lao-visitors-centres/ ]&lt;/ref&gt;

The large quantity of unexploded bombs in the area, especially [[cluster munitions]], limits free movement. Evidence of the bombing raids can be seen in the form of broken or displaced jars and bomb craters. Sightseeing on the Plain of Jars can only be done safely on cleared and marked pathways.

The [[Mines Advisory Group]], a [[non-governmental organization]], in collaboration with UNESCO and funded by the New Zealand government ([[NZAID]]), cleared unexploded bombs from the three most visited sites from July 2004&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090202185502/http://www.unescobkk.org/culture/our-projects/safeguarding-world-heritage-sites/the-plain-of-jars-important-but-imperiled/phase-iii/ ]&lt;/ref&gt; until July 2005. A second phase of bomb clearance at the sites also funded by NZAID was undertaken in 2007; four more jar sites were made safe.

The Lao PDR government and [[NZAID]] built a visitors centre that was opened on 13 August 2013 at the Plain of Jars Site 1. It is at the bottom of a hill 200m before a car park. The centre provides English language information panels on the history of the Plain of Jars culture, as well as its modern history during the 1964‚Äì1975 conflict.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en-gb.facebook.com/GovernorGeneralNewZealand/posts/507443095996408 |title=The Governor-General, Sir Jerry... - Governor-General of New Zealand &amp;#124; Facebook |website=En-gb.facebook.com |date=2013-08-12 |accessdate=2016-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20131217013947/http://www.kpl.net.la/english/E-newspaper/2013/August/14.pdf] &lt;/ref&gt;

The Lao PDR government is considering applying for status as a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage site]] for the Plain of Jars. The Lao-UNESCO Program for "Safeguarding the Plain of Jars"&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20121127023615/http://www.unescobkk.org/culture/wh/asia-pacific-world-heritage-site-projects/plain-of-jars/] &lt;/ref&gt; has been an ongoing effort by UNESCO and the Lao government to document and rehabilitate the Plain of Jars. Clearing the remaining bomb hazards must be done before the sites can be further studied and developed for tourism. One of the main objectives is community-based involvement in the management and conservation of the jar sites, which has been largely successful. However, tourism at the most visited sites has resulted in damage to some of the jars.

'''Political history''' is the narrative and analysis of political events, ideas, movements, organs of government, voters, parties and leaders.&lt;ref&gt;[http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/hi/DicHist/analytic/anaV.html Politics: The historical development of economic, legal, and political ideas and institutions, ideologies and movements.] In ''The Dictionary of the History of Ideas''.&lt;/ref&gt; It is interrelated to other fields of history, especially [[diplomatic history]], as well as constitutional history and [[public history]].

Political history studies the organization and operation of power in large societies. By focusing on the elites in power, on their impact on society, on popular response, and on the relationships with the elites in other [[social history]], which focuses predominantly on the actions and lifestyles of ordinary people,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historycooperative.org/journals/jsh/39.3/parthasarathi.html/facts.about.me Parthasarathi, Prasannan, "The State and Social History]{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[people's history]], which is historical work from the perspective of the common people.

In two decades from 1975 to 1995, the proportion of professors of history in American universities identifying with [[social history]] rose from 31% to 41%, and the proportion of political historians fell from 40% to 30%.&lt;ref&gt;Diplomatic dropped from 5% to 3%, economic history from 7% to 5%, and cultural history grew from 14% to 16%. Based on full-time professors in U.S. history departments. [[Stephen H. Haber]], David M. Kennedy, and Stephen D. Krasner, "Brothers under the Skin: Diplomatic History and International Relations," ''International Security,'' Vol. 22, No. 1 (Summer, 1997), pp. 34-43 at p. 4 2; [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2539326 online at JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt; In the history departments of British and Irish universities in 2014, of the 3410 faculty members reporting, 878 (26%) identified themselves with [[social history]], and political history came next at 841 (25%) faculty members.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.history.ac.uk/history-online/teachers "History Online:Teachers of History"] accessed 1/21/2014&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political world history ==
{{main|history of political thinking}}

The [[political history of the world]] is the history of the evolution of the political events, ideas, movements, leaders and entities, and the way these elements shape society as a whole; Special importance is their crystallisation into political entities such as republics, empires and so on; and the study of [[Diplomatic history|the international relations between them]].  Together with this descriptive analysis, the [[history of political thinking]] narrates the evolution of the political ideas and philosophy, and goes back to antiquity. Political history, and thus the history of political thinking throughout human existence stretches though up to Medieval period and the Renaissance. In the Age of Enlightenment, political entities expanded from basic systems of self-governance and monarchy to the complex democratic and communist systems that exist of the Industrialied and the Modern Era, in parallel, political systems have expanded from vaguely defined frontier-type boundaries, to the definite boundaries existing today.

==Aspects of political history==
The first "scientific" political history was written by [[Leopold von Ranke]] in Germany in the 19th century.  His methodologies profoundly affected the way historians critically examine sources; see [[historiography]] for a more complete analysis of the methodology of various approaches to history. An important aspect of political history is the study of [[ideology]] as a force for historical change. One author asserts that "political history as a whole cannot exist without the study of ideological differences and their implications."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historycooperative.org/journals/cp/vol-02/no-02/author/ Freeman, Joanne B., "Founding Bothers"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070629093305/http://www.historycooperative.org/journals/cp/vol-02/no-02/author/ |date=2007-06-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies of political history typically centre around a single [[nation]] and its political change and development. Some historians identify the growing trend towards narrow specialization in political history during recent decades: "while a college professor in the 1940s sought to identify himself as a "historian", by the 1950s "American historian" was the designation."&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard J. Jensen]], Historiography of American Political History. In Jack Greene, ed., ''Encyclopedia of American Political History'' (New York: Scribner's, 1984), vol 1. pp 1-25&lt;/ref&gt;

From the 1970s onwards, new movements challenged traditional approaches to political history. The development of [[social history]]  shifted the emphasis away from the study of leaders and national decisions, and towards the role of ordinary people, especially outsiders and minorities. Younger scholars shifted to different issues, usually focused on race, class and gender, with little room for elites. After 1990 social history itself began to fade, replaced with postmodern and cultural approaches that rejected grand narrative.

===United States: The new political history===
Traditional political history focused on major leaders and had long played a dominant role among academic historians in the United States. These studies accounted for about 25% of the scholarly books and articles written by American historians before 1950, and about 33% into the 1960s, followed by diplomacy. The arrival in the 1960s and 1970s of a new interest in [[social history]] led to the emergence of the "new political history" which saw young scholars put much more emphasis on the voters' behavior and motivation, rather than just the politicians.&lt;ref&gt;Allan G. Bogue, "United States: The 'new' political history." ''Journal of Contemporary History'' (1968) 3#1 pp: 5-27. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/259964 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Allan G. Bogue, "The new political history in the 1970s." in Michael G. Kammen, ed., ''The Past Before Us: Contemporary Historical Writing in the United States'' (1980) pp: 231-251.&lt;/ref&gt;  It relied heavily on quantitative methods to integrate social themes, especially regarding ethnicity and religion.&lt;ref&gt;Robert P. Swierenga, "Ethnocultural political analysis: a new approach to American ethnic studies," ''Journal of American Studies'' (1971) 5#1 pp: 59-79.&lt;/ref&gt; The new social science approach was a harbinger of the fading away of interest in Great Men. The eclipse of traditional political approaches during the 1970s was a major shock, though diplomatic history fell even further. It was upstaged by social history, with a race/class/gender model. The number of political articles submitted to the ''Journal of American History'' fell by half from 33% to 15%. Patterson argued that contemporary events, especially the Vietnam War and Watergate, alienated younger scholars away from the study of politicians and their deeds.  Political history never disappeared, but it never recovered its dominance among scholars, despite its sustained high popularity among the reading public.&lt;ref&gt;James T. Patterson,  "The Persistence of Political History" in  Richard S. Kirkendall, ed. ''The Organization of American Historians and the Writing and Teaching of American History'' (2011)  pp 67-74; his statistical estimates appear on pp 70, 72&lt;/ref&gt;  Some political historians made fun of their own predicament, as when [[William Leuchtenburg]] wrote, "the status of the political historians within the profession has sunk to somewhere between that of a faith healer and a chiropractor.  Political historians were all right in a way, but you might not want to bring one home to meet the family."&lt;ref&gt;William Leuchenburg, "The Pertinence of Political History: Reflection on the Significance of the State In America," ''Journal of American History''  (Dec. 1986) 73:585-600 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1902978 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;  Others were more analytical, as when Hugh Davis Graham observed:
:The ranks of traditional political historians are depleted, their assumptions and methods discredited, along with the Great White Man whose careers they chronicled.&lt;ref&gt;Hugh Davis Graham, "The stunted career of policy history: a critique and an agenda." ''The Public Historian'' (1993): 15-37. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3377943 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Britain===
Readman (2009) discusses the historiography of British political history in the 20th century. He describes how British political scholarship mostly ignored 20th century history due to temporal proximity to the recent past, the unavailability of primary sources, and the potential for bias. The article explores how transitions in scholarship have allowed for greater interest in 20th century history among scholars, which include less reliance on archival sources, methodological changes in historiography, and the flourishing of new forms of history such as oral history.&lt;ref&gt;Readman (2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Germany===
In the course of the 1960s, however, some German historians (notably [[Hans-Ulrich Wehler]] and his cohort) began to rebel against this idea, instead suggesting a "Primacy of Domestic Politics" (''Primat der Innenpolitik''), in which the insecurities of (in this case German) domestic policy drove the creation of foreign policy.  This led to a considerable body of work interpreting the domestic policies of various states and the ways this influenced their conduct of foreign policy.

===France===
The French ''[[Annales School]]'' had already put an emphasis on the role of geography and economics on history, and of the importance of broad, slow cycles rather than the constant apparent movement of the "history of events" of high politics.  It downplayed politics and diplomacy. The most important work of the ''Annales'' school, [[Fernand Braudel]]'s ''The Mediterranean and the Mediterranean World in the Age of Philip II'', contains a traditional Rankean diplomatic history of Philip II's Mediterranean policy, but only as the third and shortest section of a work largely focusing on the broad cycles of history in the ''longue dur√©e'' ("long term").  The ''Annales'' were broadly influential, leading to a turning away from political history towards an emphasis on broader trends of economic and environmental change.

===Social history===
{{main|Social history}}
In the 1960s and 1970s, an increasing emphasis on giving a voice to the voiceless and writing the history of the underclasses, whether by using the quantitative statistical methods of [[social history]] or the more postmodern assessments of [[cultural history]], also undermined the centrality of politics to the historical discipline. Leff noted how social historians, "disdained political
history as elitist, shallow, altogether passe, and irrelevant to the drama of everyday lives."&lt;ref&gt;Mark H. Leff, "Revisioning US political history." ''American Historical Review'' (1995) 100#3 pp: 829-853, quote p 829. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2168607 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;


===History of political regimes and institutions===
*MaxRange data is a project that defines and shows in detail the political status and development of institutional regimes of all states in the world from 1789. MaxRange also describes the background, development, external sources and major causes behind all political changes.
MaxRange is a dataset defining level of democracy and institutional structure(regime-type) on a 100-graded scale where every value represents a unique regimetype. Values are sorted from 1-100 based on level of democracy and political accountability. MaxRange defines the value (regimetype) corresponding to all states and every month from 1789 to 2015 and updating. MaxRange is created and developed by Max Range, and is now associated with the university of Halmstad, Sweden &lt;ref&gt;http://www.hh.se/english/schoolofeducationhumanitiesandsocialsciences/research/maxrange.65441985_en.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The SDP was founded on 26 March 1981 by four senior [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] moderates, dubbed the  "Gang of Four":&lt;ref&gt;This name was a tongue-in-cheek reference to the Maoist [[Gang of Four]]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roy Jenkins]], [[David Owen]], [[Bill Rodgers (politician)|Bill Rodgers]] and [[Shirley Williams]], who issued the [[Limehouse Declaration]].&lt;ref name="CookStevenson2000"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Chris Cook|author2=John Stevenson|title=The Longman Companion to Britain Since 1945|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rLsucAXlGy4C&amp;pg=PA95|year=2000|publisher=Longman|isbn=978-0-582-35674-0|page=95}}&lt;/ref&gt; Owen and Rodgers were sitting Labour [[Member of Parliament|Members of Parliament]] (MPs); Jenkins had left Parliament in 1977 to serve as [[President of the European Commission]], while Williams had lost her seat in the [[United Kingdom general election, 1979|1979 general election]].  The four left the Labour Party as a result of the January 1981 Wembley conference which committed the party to unilateral [[nuclear disarmament]] and withdrawal from the [[European Economic Community]].  They also believed that Labour had become too [[Left-wing politics|left-wing]], and had been infiltrated at [[Constituency Labour Party|constituency party]] level by [[Trotskyism|Trotskyist]] factions whose views and behaviour they considered to be at odds with the [[Parliamentary Labour Party]] and Labour voters.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

For the [[United Kingdom general election, 1983|1983]] and [[United Kingdom general election, 1987|1987 General Elections]], the SDP formed a [[Political coalition|political and electoral alliance]] with the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]], the [[SDP‚ÄìLiberal Alliance]]. The party merged with the Liberal Party in 1988 to form the [[Social and Liberal Democrats]], now the Liberal Democrats,&lt;ref name="BarberisMcHugh2000"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Peter Barberis|author2=John McHugh|author3=Mike Tyldesley|title=Encyclopedia of British and Irish Political Organizations: Parties, Groups and Movements of the 20th Century|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qps14mSlghcC&amp;pg=PA360|accessdate=26 July 2013|year=2000|publisher=Continuum|isbn=978-0-8264-5814-8|page=360}}&lt;/ref&gt; although a minority left to form a [[Social Democratic Party (UK, 1988)|continuing SDP]] led by David Owen.

==History==

===Origins===
The origin of the party can be traced back to the ideological divisions in the Labour Party in the 1950s (with its forerunner being the [[Campaign for Democratic Socialism]] established to support the [[Gaitskellism|Gaitskellites]]), but publicly lies in the 1979 [[Richard Dimbleby Lecture|Dimbleby Lecture]] given by [[Roy Jenkins]] as he neared the end of his [[President of the European Commission|presidency]] of the [[European Commission]]. Jenkins argued the necessity for a realignment in British politics, and discussed whether this could be brought about from within the existing [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]], or from a new group driven by European principles of [[social democracy]].{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}

There were long-running claims of corruption and administrative decay within Labour at local level (the North East of England was to become a cause c√©l√®bre),{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}  and concerns that experienced and able Labour MPs could be deselected (i.e., lose the Labour Party nomination) by those wanting to put into a safe seat their friends, family or members of their own Labour faction. In some areas, the [[Militant tendency]] were held to be systematically targeting weak local party branches in safe seat areas in order to have their own candidates selected, and thus become MPs.

[[Eddie Milne]] at [[Blyth Valley (UK Parliament constituency)|Blyth]] (Northumberland) and [[Dick Taverne]] in [[Lincoln (UK Parliament constituency)|Lincoln]] were both victims of such intrigues during the 1970s, but in both cases there was enough of a local outcry by party members ‚Äì and the electorate ‚Äì for them to fight and win their seats as independent candidates against the official Labour candidates.

===March 1973 Lincoln by-election===
{{main article|Lincoln by-election, 1973}}

In Taverne's case, he had been fighting efforts by the Lincoln [[Constituency Labour Party]] to deselect him largely over his support for British membership of the [[European Union|European Communities]]. In October 1972 he resigned his seat to force a [[Lincoln by-election, 1973|by-election]] in which he fought as a [[Democratic Labour]] candidate against the official party candidate. Taverne won by an unexpectedly large margin.&lt;ref name="Lincoln by-election"&gt;John Ramsden and Richard Jay, "Lincoln: Background to Taverne's Triumph" in "By-elections in British Politics", Macmillan, 1973, pp. 264-315.&lt;/ref&gt; He founded the short lived [[Campaign for Social Democracy]] (CFSD) thereafter, and wrote a book about events surrounding the by-election called ''The Future of the Left ‚Äì Lincoln and After'' (1972). But the CFSD failed to gain nationwide support, and Taverne lost the seat at the October 1974 General Election. Some independent Social Democrats contested the October 1974 and 1979 General Elections, but none were elected.

Taverne's Lincoln by-election campaign was also helped to a lesser degree by problems with the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative and Unionist Party]] candidate, [[Conservative Monday Club]] chairman [[Jonathan Guinness]]. His suggestion during the by-election that murderers should have razor blades left in their cells so they could decently commit suicide resulted in him being nicknamed "Old Razor Blades" during the campaign. This, combined with considerable Conservative grassroots disquiet over the Monday Club's links to the [[National Front (UK)|National Front]], persuaded some Conservative voters to switch to Taverne in protest as much as tactically to ensure Labour suffered an embarrassing loss. (Guinness had been elected as Chairman specifically to eradicate such links.)

==The Manifesto Group and the split from Labour==
===Creation of the SDP===
On 25 January 1981, leading figures from the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] ([[Roy Jenkins]], [[David Owen]], [[Shirley Williams]] and [[William Rodgers, Baron Rodgers of Quarry Bank|Bill Rodgers]], known collectively as the "Gang of Four") launched the Council for Social Democracy, which later became the Social Democratic Party in March, after outlining their policies in what became known as the [[Limehouse Declaration]]. The "Gang of Four" were [[centrists]], who had defected from the Labour Party due to what they perceived to be the influence of the [[Militant tendency]] and the "[[hard left]]" within the party,&lt;ref name="ChildsStorry2013"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Peter Childs|author2=Michael Storry|title=Encyclopedia of Contemporary British Culture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tlsKXeRt0wgC&amp;pg=PA485|date=13 May 2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=1-134-75555-4|page=485}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sassoon2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Donald Sassoon|title=One Hundred Years of Socialism: The West European Left in the Twentieth Century|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IUkBAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA698|date=30 July 2010|publisher=I.B.Tauris|isbn=978-0-85771-530-2|page=698}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Democratic", "Democratic Labour", and "Radical" were all mentioned as possible names for the new party, as well as "New Labour" (which future [[Leader of the Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party leader]] and eventual [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[Tony Blair]] would use to successfully promote the Labour Party more than a decade later)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-10518842 | work=BBC News | title=The rise and fall of New Labour | date=3 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; but eventually "Social Democratic" was settled on because the "Gang of Four" consciously wanted to mould the philosophy and ideology of the new party on the social democracy practised on mainland Europe.

The opening statement of principles contained in the preamble of the party's constitution stated that: "The SDP exists to create and defend an open, classless and more equal society which rejects prejudices based upon sex, race, colour or religion". The constitution set out the establishment of a "Council for Social Democracy" (CSD) which was, in effect, the party's standing conference. Each area party was entitled to elect delegates to the CSD. A number of internal groups flourished within the new party, the most notable of which was the [[Tawney Society]] (mirroring the function of the Fabian Society within the Labour Party).

Twenty-eight Labour MPs eventually joined the new party, along with one member of the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]], [[Christopher Brocklebank-Fowler]], MP for [[North West Norfolk (UK Parliament constituency)|North West Norfolk]]. Williams and Jenkins were not at the time Members of Parliament, but were elected to the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] at by-elections in [[Crosby by-election, 1981|Crosby]] and [[Glasgow Hillhead by-election, 1982|Glasgow Hillhead]] respectively.

{{div col end}}

Much of the party's initial membership came from the [[Social Democratic Alliance (UK)|Social Democratic Alliance]]. The party also received a boost with the recruitment of former student leaders from outside the Labour Party. These included former Communist Party of Great Britain member [[Sue Slipman]] as well as Conservative Party members including: [[Adair Turner, Baron Turner of Ecchinswell|Adair Turner]] and [[Tom Hayhoe]].{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

Although the SDP was seen as being largely a breakaway from the [[right-wing politics|right-wing]] of the Labour Party, an internal party survey found that 60% of its members had not belonged to a political party before, with 25% being drawn from Labour, 10% from the Conservatives and 5% from the Liberals.

The party enjoyed a considerable honeymoon period with the press, who made much mileage out of their quirk for proffering [[Bordeaux wine|claret]] at their functions. Claret is an "agreeable" wine, and a metaphor for the party's harmonious internal relations compared to those of the strife-torn Labour Party of the period.

The policies of the SDP emphasised a middle position between perceived extremes of [[Thatcherism]] and the Labour Party. Its constitution argued for "the fostering of a strong public sector and a strong private sector without frequent frontier changes". The SDP favoured some [[Neoliberalism|neoliberal]] Thatcherite reforms during the 1980s, such as legislation aimed at reforming the trade unions (although the parliamentary SDP actually split three ways on Norman Tebbit's 1982 Industrial Relations Bill, most voting for, some against, and others abstaining), but took a more welfarist position than the Conservative Party, being more sceptical of Conservative welfare reforms (particularly regarding the National Health Service).{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

At the party's first electoral contest, Jenkins narrowly failed to win a [[Warrington by-election, 1981|by-election at Warrington]] in July 1981, describing it as his "first defeat, but by far (his) greatest victory". At the [[Glasgow Hillhead by-election, 1982|Glasgow Hillhead by-election]] in March 1982, another candidate called Douglas Parkin, nominated by a party called the Social Democratic Party which had been formed in [[Manchester]] in 1979, changed his name to Roy Harold Jenkins to contest the seat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Craig |first=F. W. S. |authorlink=F. W. S. Craig |title=British Parliamentary Election Results 1974‚Äì1983 |publisher=Parliamentary Research Services |year=1984 |page=311}}&lt;/ref&gt; SDP polling agents were given special dispensation by the Returning Officer to have placards outside of polling stations to state which one on the ballot papers was the real Roy. Ultimately, the SDP's Jenkins was elected.

A [[Social Democratic Party (UK) leadership election, 1982|leadership election]] was held later in the year, Jenkins beating Owen in the ballot to become the first leader of the new party. Later in the year, Shirley Williams defeated Bill Rodgers in the ballot to become SDP president.

===The Alliance===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:SDP-Liberal Alliance.png|thumb|right|The symbol of the SDP‚ÄìLiberal Alliance, combining the yellow and black diamond of the Liberals with the typeface of the Social Democrats.]] --&gt;
The SDP formed the [[SDP‚ÄìLiberal Alliance]] with the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] in June 1981, under the joint leadership of Roy Jenkins (SDP) and Liberal leader [[David Steel]]. The Liberal Party, and in particular its leader, [[David Steel]], had applauded the formation of the SDP from the sidelines from the very start. Senior Liberal MP for [[Rochdale (UK Parliament constituency)|Rochdale]] [[Cyril Smith]] caused some embarrassment, however, by publicly stating that the SDP "should be strangled at birth".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2010/sep/03/sir-cyril-smith-obituary|title=Sir Cyril Smith obituary |publisher=The Guardian|date=3 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; During an era of public disillusionment with the two main parties  ‚Äì Labour and the Conservatives ‚Äì and widescale unemployment, the Alliance achieved considerable success at parliamentary by-elections. At one point in late-1981, the party had an opinion poll rating of over 50%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/1136223.stm | work=BBC News | title=SDP: Breaking the mould | date=25 January 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 1981, David Steel was able to address the Liberal Party conference with the phrase "Go back to your constituencies, and prepare for government!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/3185313.stm | work=BBC News | title=Conference season's greatest hits | date=10 September 2003 | accessdate=7 April 2010 | first=Ollie | last=Stone-Lee}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early-1982, after public disagreements over who could fight which seats in the forthcoming election, the poll rating dipped, but the party remained ahead of both Labour and the Conservatives. However, following the outbreak of the [[Falklands War]] on 2 April 1982, the Conservative government of [[Margaret Thatcher]] soared from third to first place in the public opinion polls. The standing of the SDP‚ÄìLiberal Alliance and Labour Party declined. By this stage, however, the SDP‚ÄìLiberal Alliance already 30 MPs in parliament - virtually all of them defectors from Labour, joined by just the one Conservative MP.

Labour lost [[Bermondsey (UK Parliament constituency)|Bermondsey]], one of their ten safest seats, at a [[Bermondsey by-election, 1983|by-election in February 1983]] to Liberal candidate [[Simon Hughes]]: the sitting Labour MP [[Bob Mellish, Baron Mellish|Robert Mellish]] resigned to work for the [[London Docklands Development Corporation]] but, being opposed to the selection by his left-wing [[Constituency Labour Party]] of [[Peter Tatchell]], supported the former leader of [[London Borough of Southwark|Southwark council]] John O'Grady as "[[Real Bermondsey Labour]]" giving an impression of Labour division and in-fighting.

At the [[United Kingdom general election, 1983|1983 general election]], the SDP‚ÄìLiberal Alliance won more than 25% of the national vote, close behind Labour's 28%, but well behind the 44% secured by the Conservatives. However, because of the limitations of the [[First-past-the-post voting|first-past-the-post electoral system]] used in the United Kingdom, only 23 Alliance MPs were elected, six of whom were members of the SDP. The party's leader, Roy Jenkins, managed to retain his seat at [[Glasgow Hillhead]], but SDP President Shirley Williams was defeated at Crosby (which she had won at a by-election in November 1981) as a result of unfavourable boundary changes. Labour Party leader [[Michael Foot]], who resigned within days of the election, was critical of the SDP‚ÄìLiberal Alliance for siphoning support away from Labour, allowing the Conservatives to win more seats and secure a triple-digit majority, while Labour was left with 209 seats in Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/june/9/newsid_2500000/2500847.stm |title=1983: Thatcher wins landslide victory |publisher=BBC News |date=1970-06-09 |accessdate=2016-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The MP for [[Plymouth Devonport (UK Parliament constituency)|Plymouth Devonport]], Dr. David Owen (who had been a Labour Government Minister under [[Harold Wilson]] and [[James Callaghan]] between 1974-79), took over as SDP leader after the 1983 general election. He was more sceptical about close relations with the Liberals than his predecessor Roy Jenkins, and favoured retaining the party's distinct identity. Owen's influence ensured that proposals for a merger between the two parties were shelved after a lengthy debate at the 1983 SDP conference.

During the 1983-87 parliament, some SDP members started to become unsettled at what appeared to be the increasingly right-wing course taken by SDP leader David Owen. This resulted in some members launching the Limehouse Group in an attempt to keep the party on the centre-left course that was first propounded in the [[Limehouse Declaration]].

Two more SDP MPs were elected at [[by-election]]s during the 1983-87 parliament, but at the [[United Kingdom general election, 1987|1987 general election]], the Alliance's share of the vote fell to 23%, and the SDP's parliamentary party was reduced from eight members to five. Roy Jenkins was among those who lost their seats. [[Mike Hancock (UK politician)|Mike Hancock]] had won a [[Portsmouth South by-election, 1984|by-election at Portsmouth South in 1984]] from the Conservatives which was lost in 1987, but [[Rosie Barnes]], who had won the bitterly contested [[Greenwich by-election, 1987|Greenwich by-election]] in February 1987 from Labour; managed to hold on at the general election in June that year.

From the outset, the formation of the Alliance had raised questions as to whether it would lead to a merged party, or the two parties were destined to compete with each other. This in turn led to grassroots tensions in some areas between Liberal and SDP branches that impaired their ability to mount joint campaigns successfully. Such cross-party feuding was part of the reason for Jenkins losing his Glasgow Hillhead seat to [[George Galloway]] of the Labour Party in 1987.

Liberal pride was further damaged by the sustained lampooning of the Alliance by ITV's popular ''[[Spitting Image]]'' satirical puppet comedy programme, which portrayed Steel as the craven lickspittle of Owen;  One sketch had Owen proposing to a simpering Steel that the parties merged under a new name: "and for our side we'll take 'Social Democratic', and from your side, we'll take ‚ÄòParty'"; and indeed a new leader "from your side we will take 'David' and from ours 'Owen'", to which a hesitant Steel agreed.

===Merger, disestablishment and splits===
After the disappointment of 1987, Steel proposed a formal merger of the two parties.  Jenkins and Steel had believed this to be eventually inevitable after the party failed to break through at the 1983 election.  The proposal, also supported by Williams and Rodgers, was fiercely opposed by Owen, who argued that such a merger would not be accepted by the electorate, and would not reverse their declining share of the vote.  Jenkins denied that a merger had been his original intent.&lt;ref name=royjenkins-autobio&gt;{{cite book |page=535 |title=A Life at the Centre |first=Roy |last=Jenkins |isbn=978-1-84275-177-0 |publisher=Politico's |quote=The case for merger arose only once the partnership had been tried on the ground ... At the beginning, while I was committed in my mind to a close partnership, I had no set view either for or against eventual merger.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

But the majority of the SDP's membership (along with those of the Liberals) voted in favour of the union. Owen resigned as leader and was replaced by [[Robert Maclennan, Baron Maclennan of Rogart|Robert Maclennan]]. Steel and Maclennan headed the new "Social and Liberal Democrats" party from 3 March 1988. An interim working name for the party, the "Democrats", was adopted by conference on 26 September 1988. This proved to be unpopular, and the party was renamed the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]] in October 1989, as had been originally proposed at the September 1988 conference by the party's [[Tiverton, Devon|Tiverton]] branch.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}

Most SDP members, including SDP MP and future Liberal Democrat leader [[Charles Kennedy]], joined Maclennan in the merged party, but Owen created a [[Social Democratic Party (UK, 1988)|continuing SDP]], along with two other MPs, [[John Cartwright (UK politician)|John Cartwright]] and [[Rosie Barnes]]. This party performed poorly at the [[Bootle by-election, May 1990|May 1990 by-election]] in [[Bootle]], behind the [[Monster Raving Loony Party]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Lib Dem meltdown: Five other humiliating by-election defeats|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/lib-dem-meltdown-five-other-humiliating-byelection-defeats-9500624.html|publisher=The Independent|date=6 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It subsequently disbanded, although a [[Social Democratic Party (UK, 1990‚Äìpresent)|third SDP]] was formed, though currently operates on a much less influential scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Philpot|first=Robert|title=The SDP lives on - in Bridlington|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/node/195459|work=[[New Statesman]]|date=16 January 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was also a continuing [[Liberal Party (UK, 1989)|Liberal Party]], led by [[Michael Meadowcroft]] and David Morrish, mainly based on Liverpool and West Country Liberals who feared a dilution by the former SDP members of the Liberal tradition within the merged party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Liverpool elected mayor candidates: Steve Radford, Liberal|url=http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/liverpool-elected-mayor-candidates-steve-3348321|publisher=Liverpool Echo|date=8 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
Following the dissolution of the SDP, a number of members endorsed [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[John Major]] for the [[1992 UK general election|1992 general election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.johnmajor.co.uk/page4356.html|title=Social Democrats Press Release - Supporting John Major|publisher=John Major official|date=17 February 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Starhawk''' ('''Stakar of the House of Ogord''')&lt;ref&gt;Stakar was kidnapped at the moment of birth and his mother did not know what his name was. If there were any records of the incident at his birthplace, planet Vesper, they could have mentioned his biological father's surname, 'Vaughn'. He received his given name, 'Stakar', from his adoptive father, Ogord. Arcturian computer records depicted in ''Marvel Presents'' referred to him as 'Stakar of the House of Ogord' rather than 'Stakar Ogord'. He was evidently still legally considered to be part of Ogord's 'House', despite turning against it.&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[fictional character]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. He was created by [[Steve Gerber]] (writer) and [[Sal Buscema]] (artist). He is an [[antihero]] in the [[Earth-691]] [[timeline]] of the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]].

Stakar was fated to eventually re-inhabit his infant body, reliving his life over countless times. Because of the knowledge of things to come, he manipulated events to affect what he felt would be the best outcome, referring to himself as "'''One Who Knows'''". He made many enemies in doing so, but his tampering and guidance also led to the formation of the [[Guardians of the Galaxy (1969 team)|Guardians of the Galaxy]] in the 31st Century.&lt;ref&gt;''Guardians of the Galaxy'' v1 #26&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon receiving his power from the Hawk God, Starhawk identified himself and summarized his purpose by saying "I am the wisdom and the glory of your ancestors. I am the light and the giver of light. I am your heritage and your destiny! I am the POWER that was Arcturus!"&lt;ref&gt;''Marvel Presents #10&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sylvester Stallone]] plays Stakar in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]],&lt;ref name="screencrush.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://screencrush.com/kurt-russell-and-sylvester-stallone-will-return-for-more-marvel-movies/|title=Russell and Stallone Will Make Marvel Movies After ‚ÄòGotG2‚Äô|website=ScreenCrush|accessdate=15 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; with his first appearance being in ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2]]''.

==Publication history==
{{Expand section|date=December 2012}}
A character called Starhawk appeared in an advertisement on the last page of ''[[Marvel Super-Heroes (comics)|Marvel Super-Heroes]]'' #20 (May, 1969) as the feature that would appear in the next issue. That next issue, though, and all subsequent issues of the title, were reprints of older Marvel material. The unused cover of the Starhawk feature from ''Marvel Super-Heroes'' was used as the cover of the third issue of ''[[Marvelmania]]'', Marvel's in-house fanzine, and the first part of the unused story itself, by [[Roy Thomas]] and [[Dan Adkins]], was printed in ''Marvelmania'' #6. Though the serialization was to continue in the next issue, the title was cancelled before that happened.&lt;ref&gt;{{Marvunapp|http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix3/starhawkmsh.htm|John Kaminski's profile of the character}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The in-continuity Starhawk first appeared in a cameo appearance in ''[[The Defenders (comic book)|The Defenders]]'' #27 (Sep 1975),with his first full appearance in ''[[The Defenders (comic book)|The Defenders]]'' #28 (Oct 1975). The character was created by [[Steve Gerber]] and [[Sal Buscema]]. It is unclear whether this Starhawk has any connection to the ''Marvel Super-Heroes'' character.

Starhawk appeared along with the rest of the original Guardians of the Galaxy team in the 2014 series ''[[Guardians 3000]]''. Writer [[Dan Abnett]] described him as "the soul" of the team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsarama.com/21436-marvels-old-guardians-up-to-new-tricks-in-guardians-3000.html|title=Marvel‚Äôs Old Guardians Up To New Tricks in GUARDIANS 3000|publisher=|accessdate=15 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fictional character biography==
===Origin===
A male child was born to the superheroes [[Quasar (Wendell Vaughn)|Quasar]] and [[Kismet (Marvel Comics)|Kismet]] in about the year 2002 of the [[Earth-691]] [[alternate timeline|timeline]].&lt;ref&gt;Kismet discovered she was pregnant during War of the Worlds, which commenced in June 2001, according to ''Marvel Graphic Novel'' #7.&lt;/ref&gt; As such, he was half [[human]] and half-artificially created being. Just as soon as he was born on the planet Vesper, he was kidnapped and deposited on the planet [[Arcturus]] IV. The baby was discovered by an Arcturian couple who were among the last of their planet's [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutants]]; for much of his life, Stakar would believe that these mutants were his birth parents. The mutants were found and slain by the Reavers of Arcturus, Arcturian military cadres dedicated to eradicating the mutants of their race. The Reaver Ogord discovered the infant and, assuming him to be a normal Arcturian, adopted the child and raised him as his own with his wife Salaan, naming the boy Stakar.&lt;ref&gt;''Marvel Presents'' #9&lt;/ref&gt;

Stakar cultivated an interest in [[science]] and [[archaeology]] and explored ruins containing the Hawk God. Around the year 2020,&lt;ref&gt;Stakar was approaching the Arcturian age of manhood, which would have been at least 18 years after 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; he and his adoptive sister [[Aleta Ogord]] reanimated the dormant deity and were physically transformed. They took turns occupying the same physical space, while the other stayed in a type of "limbo". They were given extraordinary power and left Arcturus IV for the stars; when dominant, Stakar adopted the costumed identity of Starhawk. Developing romantic feelings for one another, Stakar and Aleta petitioned the Hawk God to temporarily separate them. During this time, they had three children together: Sita, John and Tara.&lt;ref&gt;''Marvel Presents'' #9‚Äì10&lt;/ref&gt;

===Guardians of the Galaxy===
As an adventurer and protector, Starhawk revealed himself to the Guardians of the Galaxy and the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]] in the year 3014. He aided them in overthrowing the [[Badoon]] occupation of Earth.&lt;ref&gt;''Defenders'' #27&lt;/ref&gt; Starhawk joined the Guardians of the Galaxy in a space mission, and helped defeat the [[Topographical Man]].&lt;ref&gt;''Marvel Presents'' #3‚Äì7&lt;/ref&gt; It is later revealed he manipulated events to bring the Guardians together; for example, when Charlie-27 teleported from Jupiter to escape the Badoon, Starhawk caused him to be transported to Pluto where he met Martinex.&lt;ref&gt;''Guardians of the Galaxy'' #26, cover-dated July 1992&lt;/ref&gt;

During this time, Stakar's three children (Tara, John and Sita) were changed into energy vampires by Aleta's father and sent to kill Stakar. They died of accelerated old age. Aleta thereafter blamed Stakar (rather than her father) for the deaths of their children, and their relationship never recovered.&lt;ref&gt;''Marvel Presents'' #9-11&lt;/ref&gt;

Starhawk teamed with the time-traveling [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]], and battled [[Korvac]] and his Minions of Menace.&lt;ref&gt;''Thor Annual'' #6&lt;/ref&gt; Starhawk later traveled to the 1970s alongside his fellow Guardians, and assisted the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] in battle against [[Korvac]].&lt;ref&gt;''Avengers'' #167‚Äì168, 170, 173, 175‚Äì177&lt;/ref&gt; Alongside the Guardians, the [[Fantastic Four]], [[Thor (Marvel Comics)#Dargo Ktor|Dargo]], and [[Silver Surfer|Keeper]], Starhawk battled manifestations of Korvac's power in various eras.&lt;ref&gt;''Fantastic Four Annual'' #24; ''Thor Annual'' #16; ''Silver Surfer Annual'' #4; ''Guardians of the Galaxy Annual'' #1&lt;/ref&gt;

In 3017, Starhawk accompanied the Guardians on a quest to find the lost [[Captain America's shield|shield]] of [[Captain America]]. He battled [[Taserface]] and the Stark, and was physically separated from Aleta in an accident.&lt;ref&gt;''Guardians of the Galaxy'' #1‚Äì4&lt;/ref&gt; Aleta was the stronger of the pair, and Stakar forcibly reabsorbed her to sustain himself. The two struggled for dominance of their physical space, and Stakar metemorphosed into a 'dark' version of himself, projecting 'black light'.

Because of Stakar's assault on their teammate, the Guardians chose to expel him from the team. Eventually, Aleta became dominant, and reverted Stakar's body to an infant state. Aware of his destiny, she sent him back in time to begin his life cycle again.&lt;ref&gt;''Guardians of the Galaxy'' #32‚Äì33&lt;/ref&gt;

===Freed from rebirth===
When the Guardians traveled back in time to the 20th century of [[Earth-616]], their native timeline was altered ‚Äì to the extent that Starhawk had lived his entire life over again and was waiting for their arrival. Stakar and Aleta had harsh words for each other, and the Hawk God appeared and intervened, attaching the two ex-lovers by bonding their fingers together.&lt;ref&gt;''Guardians of the Galaxy'' #45&lt;/ref&gt; After being forced to work together for a time, the Hawk God again granted them audience, allowing them to plead their cases. He separated them and allowed only Stakar to retain his power, while Aleta was given back her former power to manipulate light.&lt;ref&gt;''Guardians of the Galaxy'' #50&lt;/ref&gt;

Aleta then chose to stay with the Guardians, while the Hawk God told Stakar the truth about his ancestry.&lt;ref&gt;''Guardians of the Galaxy'' #51&lt;/ref&gt; He then went on a quest to learn more. During this quest he found the wounded Silver Surfer, whom he healed and equipped his Quantum Bands for a short time. Eon then reveals to Stakar that his biological father Quasar once wore the bands. Starhawk is then consumed by Abrogate, a place where all former Quantum-Band wielders go after death. Quasar tells him about his lover and Stakar's mother [[Kismet (Marvel Comics)|Kismet]]. Stakar finds her alive and living in a secluded religious retreat on the planet Vesper.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;''Guardians of the Galaxy #62&lt;/ref&gt; After that, a creature who called himself Era, the son of [[Eon (comics)|Eon]], revealed himself. It admitted having kidnapped Stakar at birth, along with other vile deeds.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

With the encouragement of the Hawk God, Starhawk and Kismet dedicated themselves to locating and confronting Era.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

===Return===
Using some technology from his timeline, Starhawk teleports himself into the 21st century of the [[Earth-616]] timeline, to meet up with that era's equivalent of the [[Guardians of the Galaxy (2008 team)|Guardians of the Galaxy]] on [[Knowhere]]. [[Vance Astro]], aka Major Victory, was found by this new squad of Guardians, and Starhawk fights him before teleporting away.&lt;ref name="GotGv2_3"&gt;''Guardians of the Galaxy'' vol. 2, #3 (Sept. 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; Starhawk again ventures to Knowhere, but this time appears as a woman. Claiming that there is not meant to be a Guardians of the Galaxy at this point in the timeline, and that Major Victory's appearance there has put the entire future in flux, she again attempts to kill Astro and the Guardians.&lt;ref name="GotGv2_5"&gt;''Guardians of the Galaxy'' vol. 2, #5 (Nov. 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; She is detained by the Guardians,&lt;ref name="GotGv2_6"&gt;''Guardians of the Galaxy'' vol. 2, #6 (Dec. 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; and held captive for a time, until [[Moondragon]] released her.&lt;ref name="GotGv2_15"&gt;''Guardians of the Galaxy'' vol. 2, #15 (Aug. 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; She discovers that the anomaly that is disturbing the time stream is not Astro or the Guardians, but instead [[Black Bolt]] activating a bomb that will cause time and space to collapse. Starhawk sacrifices her life to save the Guardians, and instructs [[Star-Lord]] to stop Black Bolt, at any cost.&lt;ref name="GotGv2_16"&gt;''Guardians of the Galaxy'' vol. 2, #16 (Sept. 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Powers and abilities==
The true extent of Starhawk's powers is unknown, but they are said to be immense in nature. He has an incredibly long lifespan, possibly inherited from his mother or due to his empowerment by the Hawk God.

Starhawk can manipulate light to create concussive force blasts of [[photon]]ic energy, heat, and solid-light constructs. He can also fly at the speed of light by tapping anti-gravitons, and survive in the vacuum of space. By tapping into Aleta's powers (when merged with her), he can also generate solid constructs of light; it is unknown if he can do so since their separation. His natural senses, especially eyesight, are enhanced to a superhuman degree; in addition, his powers give him extrasensory sensitivity to energy patterns and fluctuations in his environment, and he can track energy trails across intergalactic distances.

He has superhuman strength and durability, and he can enhance these further by reinforcing his body with light energy; on one occasion, he was able to engage in hand-to-hand combat with the thunder god [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]. He has an immunity to most known diseases and radiation sickness.

He seemingly has [[precognition]], designating himself as "One-Who-Knows", but this is actually an effect of remembering what happened in his previous life cycle. However, due to Starhawk's efforts to change events for the better in each cycle, as well as the manipulations of beings with greater understanding of the universe (such as [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]]), these memories can become unreliable; the overall thrust of events may be the same, but vital details might differ from his previous incarnation.

When he forced Aleta to re-merge with him after their second separation, Starhawk's power changed from light to dark, and he was able to create constructs out of solid darkness, and fire blasts of shadowy force. Valentino had initially decided to call him [[Shadowhawk]], but [[Tom DeFalco]] convinced him to save the name for a brand new character.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.imagecomics.com/messageboard/viewtopic.php?t=144&amp;postdays=0&amp;postorder=asc&amp;start=15&amp;sid=fd50fa9bc46f3072e79db765589e9e5a |title=View topic ‚Äì Guardians thread |publisher=Image Comics |date= |accessdate=2011-04-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110516161522/http://www.imagecomics.com/messageboard/viewtopic.php?t=144&amp;postdays=0&amp;postorder=asc&amp;start=15&amp;sid=fd50fa9bc46f3072e79db765589e9e5a |archivedate=2011-05-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stakar has knowledge of the archaeology of the planet Arcturus IV. He also has extensive knowledge of various civilizations throughout the Milky Way Galaxy.

His costume is made of alien materials, including a retracting transparent facemask and life support system, and retractable solar wind collector wings.

{{Italic title}}
'''''The Knight of the Burning Pestle''''' is a play in five acts by [[Francis Beaumont]], first performed at [[Blackfriars Theatre]] in 1607&lt;ref name="Whitted"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Whitted|first1=Brent E.|title=Staging Exchange: Why "The Knight of the Burning Pestle" Flopped at Blackfriars in 1607|journal=Early Theatre|date=2012|volume=15|issue=2|pages=111‚Äì130|jstor=43499628}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Smith"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Smith|first1=Joshua S.|title=Reading Between the Acts: Satire and the Interludes in The Knight of the Burning Pestle|journal=Studies in Philology|date=Summer 2012|volume=109|issue=4|pages=474‚Äì495|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/481431/pdf|accessdate=12 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Billington"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Billington|first1=Michael|title=The Knight of the Burning Pestle review|url=https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/feb/27/the-knight-burning-pestle-adele-thomas-review|accessdate=12 November 2017|work=The Guardian|date=27 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and published in a [[book size|quarto]] in 1613.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Patterson|editor1-first=Michael|title=The Oxford Dictionary of Plays|date=2005|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-860417-4|page=224}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is the earliest whole [[parody]] (or [[pastiche]]) play in English. The play is a satire on [[romance (poetry)|chivalric romances]] in general, similar to ''[[Don Quixote]]'', and a parody of [[Thomas Heywood]]'s ''[[The Four Prentices of London]]'' and [[Thomas Dekker (poet)|Thomas Dekker]]'s ''[[The Shoemaker's Holiday]]''. It breaks the [[fourth wall]] from its outset.

==Text==
[[File:Francis-Beaumont.jpg|thumb|right|[[Francis Beaumont]], circa 1600]]
It is most likely that the play was written for the child actors at [[Blackfriars Theatre]], where [[John Marston (poet)|John Marston]] had previously had plays produced. In addition to the textual history testifying to a Blackfriars origin, there are multiple references within the text to Marston, to the actors as children (notably from the Citizen's Wife, who seems to recognise the actors from their school), and other indications that the performance took place in a house known for biting satire and sexual double entendre. Blackfriars specialised in satire, according to Andrew Gurr (quoted in Hattaway, ix), and Michael Hattaway suggests that the dissonance of the youth of the players and the gravity of their roles combined with the multiple internal references to holiday revels because the play had a [[Shrovetide]] or midsummer's day first production (Hattaway xxi and xiii). The play is certainly carnivalesque, but the date of the first performance is purely speculative. The second quarto publication came in 1635, with a third the same year. The play was omitted from the [[Beaumont and Fletcher folios|first Beaumont and Fletcher folio]] of 1647 but included in the second folio of 1679. The play was later widely thought to be the joint work of Beaumont and [[John Fletcher (playwright)|John Fletcher]].&lt;ref&gt;It was so credited in the London revivals of 1904, 1920, 1932, 1975 and 1981 detailed in the "Staging" section&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
Scene: London and the neighbouring Country, except Act IV Scene ii, set in Moldavia.

As a play called "The London Merchant" is about to be performed, a Citizen and his Wife "in the audience" of the play interrupt to complain that the play will misrepresent the middle-class citizens of the city. The Citizen, who identifies himself as a grocer, climbs onto the stage, and he brings his Wife up to sit with him on the stage next to some Gentlemen of the audience. The Citizen and his Wife demand that the players put on a play of their own choosing and suggest that one of them‚Äîin fact, their apprentice, Rafe&lt;ref&gt;In mid-20th century revivals the name was usually rendered as "Ralph": see "A Jacobean Romp", ''The Times'', 25 November 1920, p. 10 and "The Old Vic: 'The Knight Of The Burning Pestle'.", ''The Times'', 5 January 1932, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;‚Äîshould have a part in the play.  Rafe demonstrates his dramatic skills by quoting some lines of Shakespeare (Hotspur in [[Henry IV, Part 1]]). He then has a part created for him as a [[knight errant]]. He refers to himself as the "Grocer Errant" and has a burning [[pestle]] on his shield as a [[heraldic device]].

This meta-fictional plot is intercut with the main plot of the interrupted play, "The London Merchant", where Jasper Merrythought, the merchant's apprentice, is in love with his master's daughter, Luce, and must elope with her to save her from the arranged marriage with Humphrey, a "swell" or City man of fashion. Humphrey is portrayed as a gullible weakling who often speaks in [[malapropism]]s indicating that his pretensions to learning and breeding are false. Luce pretends to Humphrey that she has made an unusual vow: she will only marry a man who has the spirit to run away with her. She knows that Humphrey will immediately inform her father of this plan. She intends to pretend to elope with Humphrey, knowing that her father will allow this to happen, but will then ditch him and meet up with Jasper.

Meanwhile, Jasper's mother has decided to leave her husband Old Merrythought, who, in an apparent mid-life crisis, has spent all his savings in drinking and partying. Whenever he appears he turns every conversation into a song. When Jasper seeks his mother's aid, she rejects him in favour of his younger brother Michael. She tells Michael that she has kept jewellery they can use to live on while he learns a trade. They leave Merrythought, but they get lost in a wood where she loses her jewellery. Jasper arrives in the same wood to meet Luce and finds the jewels. Luce and Humphrey appear. Jasper, as planned, knocks over Humphrey and runs off with Luce. Rafe the "grocer errant" arrives. He believes he has met a damsel in distress when he sees the distraught Mrs Merrythought. He takes the Merrythoughts to an inn, expecting the Host to put them up for free because of a chivalric code of service. When the Host demands payment for the room and meal Rafe is perplexed. The host decides to tell Rafe there are more people in distress he must save from an evil barber named Barbaroso (in fact a barber surgeon who is attempting cures on various people with venereal diseases). Rafe effects a daring rescue of Barbaroso's patients.

The Citizen and his Wife demand more chivalric and exotic adventures for Rafe, so a scene is created in which Rafe must go to Moldavia, where he meets the Princess of Moldavia, who falls in love with him. But he says he has already plighted troth to his lady, Susan "a cobbler's maid in Milk Street". The Princess reluctantly lets him go, lamenting that she cannot come to England because she has always dreamed of tasting English beer.

Things go awry for Jasper when he decides to "test" Luce's love by pretending he intends to kill her because of the way her father has treated him. She is shocked, but declares her devotion to him. At this point Humphrey and her father arrive with other men. They beat up Jasper, and drag Luce away from him. The merchant locks Luce in her room. Jasper decides to pretend he has died. He writes a letter, supposedly a dying apology for his behaviour. It is sent with the news of his death to the merchant. Jasper's coffin is carried to the merchant's house (as the merchant is responsible for his apprentice). Luce laments his death, but he gets up from the coffin and explains that he intends to save her from marriage to Humphrey. She is carried out in the coffin while Japser remains in the house. When the merchant enters Jasper pretends to be his [[Banquo|own ghost]] and frightens the merchant into expelling Humphrey from the house and helping Jasper's near-bankrupt father. A chastened Mrs Merrythought
returns to her husband and by this point Luce has been delivered to the house in the coffin. Jasper appears and reveals he is still alive. Then the merchant also appears and asks for Old Merrythought's forgiveness. The merchant gives consent to Jasper's match with Luce. The Citizen and the Wife demand that Rafe's part of the drama should also have an appropriate ending, so Rafe is given a heroic chivalric dying scene, and everyone is satisfied.

==Satire==
The play hits a number of satirical and parodic points. The audience is satirised, with the interrupting grocer, but the domineering and demanding merchant class is also satirised in the main plot. Beaumont makes fun of the new demand for stories of the middle classes for the middle classes, even as he makes fun of that class's actual taste for an exoticism and a chivalry that is entirely hyperbolic. The Citizen and his Wife are bombastic, sure of themselves, and certain that their prosperity carries with it mercantile advantages (the ability to demand a different play for their admission fee than the one the actors have prepared).

The broader humour of the play derives from innuendo and sexual jokes, as well as joking references to other dramatists. The players, for example, plant a winking joke at the Citizen's expense, as the pestle of Rafe's herald is a phallic metaphor, and a burning pestle/penis implies [[syphilis]], on the one hand, and sexual bravado, on the other. The inability of the Citizen and Wife to comprehend how they are satirised, or to understand the main plot, allows the audience to laugh at itself, even as it admits its complicity with the Citizen's boorish tastes.

==Staging==
If written for Blackfriars, ''The Knight of the Burning Pestle'' would have initially been produced in a small private theatre, with minimal stage properties. However, the private theatres were first to introduce the practice of having audience members seated on the stage proper (according to Gurr, ''op cit.'' in Hattaway ix), which is a framing device for this play's action. Additionally, the higher cost of a private theatre (sixpence, compared to a penny at some public theatres) changed the composition of the audience and would have suggested a more critically aware (and demanding) crowd. The play makes use of several "interludes," which would have been spare entertainments between the acts (but which are integrated into the performance in this case), again emphasising the smallness and spareness of the initial staging (as interludes would have allowed for technicians to arrange the lights and scenery and to put actors in place).
Revivals of the play are largely undocumented, but some are attested. Hattaway suggests that it was performed in the [[Cockpit Theatre]] in [[Drury Lane]] in 1635, at court the next year, and then after the Restoration at the [[Theatre Royal Drury Lane]] in 1662 and again in 1665 and 1667 (Hattaway xxix). The play "has proved popular with amateur and university groups," according to Hattaway, but not with professional troupes.

==Reception==
The play was a failure when it was first performed, though it won approval over the next generation or two. In [[Richard Brome]]'s ''[[The Sparagus Garden]]'' (1635), the character Rebecca desires to see it "above all plays." Beaumont's comedy was performed at Court by [[Queen Henrietta's Men]] on 28 February 1636 ([[Old Style and New Style dates|new style]]).&lt;ref&gt;See Zitner's edition, pp. 42‚Äì3.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Theatre techniques''' are procedures that facilitate a successful presentation of a play. They also include any practices that advance and enhance the understanding the audience brings to the action and the acting by the cast
on stage.

==The playwright's craft==
Theatre technique is part of the [[playwright]]'s creative writing of drama, as a kind of [[mimesis]] rather than mere [[illusion]] or [[imitation]] of life, in that the playwright is able to present a reality to the audience that is different, yet recognisable to that which they usually identify with in their everyday lives.&lt;br&gt; Another aspect of this is that of creating the kind of [[dialogue]] that makes the playwright's characters come alive and allows for their development in the course of his dramatization.

The playwright's art also consists in the ability to convey to the audience the ideas that give essence to the drama within the frame of its structure. 
Finally, the feeling for the natural divisions of a play‚Äîincluding [[act (theater)|act]]s, [[scene (fiction)|scene]]s, and changes of place‚Äîits entries and exits, and the positioning of the [[cast member|cast]] are integral to playwriting technique.

One of the playwright‚Äôs functions is that concerned with [[adaptation]]s of existing traditional drama, such as [[Charles Marowitz]]‚Äôs [[collage]]s of ''[[Hamlet]]'' and ''[[Macbeth]]'' and other re-interpretations of [[Shakespeare]]'s works, as well as [[Tom Stoppard]]‚Äôs approaches in ''[[Rosencrantz &amp; Guildenstern Are Dead]]'', ''[[Dogg's Hamlet]]'', and ''[[Cahoot's Macbeth]]''.

==The director‚Äôs craft==
The director these days is responsible for the actual production of a play, as opposed to earlier days when it was the producer who, at least in Britain until the 1950s, had this task. In earlier centuries it was the author, an actor-manager, or a leading actor with whom the responsibilities of staging a drama were invested.

The director produces the play in the way he envisages how it ought to be seen as he interprets what the playwright intended within the drama; he takes care of the effectiveness of the rehearsals of the actors; and coordinates the work of designers and technicians in the production. 
 
However, the playwright‚Äôs work is still reflected in the director‚Äôs [[Prompter (theatre)|prompt copy]], a separate form of stage instructions worked out in detail by the director, in which each actor is given details as to what is happening onstage, where exactly he has to be in relation to the back, front, left, or right of the stage, and what he is to do at any one time during the play.

== Stage management and stagecraft ==
The [[stage manager]] has to work with the director, and ascertain whether both the director‚Äôs objectives and the perceptions of the [[stage designer]]s are compatible and realistic. They are usually the link between the director and the rest of the company, and are responsible for the director‚Äôs visions being passed down to each [[actor]] and member of the [[running crew]]. They are also responsible for [[safety]] and running an orderly backstage area. They maintain the prompt book and the [[call board]], to which [[rehearsal]] schedule notes are affixed for the cast.

[[Stagecraft]] overall has to address the various shortcomings of the stage‚Äôs spatial and physical limitations. For example, the stage alone cannot be expected to provide wide and distant [[Panorama|vista]]s, or vast spaces where armies gather or huge masses of people congregate. Natural phenomena such as [[thunderstorm]]s or [[wind]]s, that are often part of the drama, cannot be recreated in their original form. Furthermore, because of the distance involved, it is difficult for actors to portray the feelings, tensions and passions of their characters to the [[audience]] with much distinctiveness.

It is for these reasons that special technologies and techniques have been developed from classical times onward to supplement and augment the effects that are to be realised. Technical specialists help to implement these techniques by providing expertise in various areas of the production. The stage manager and their team must ultimately draw all these separate techniques together to create an effective and successful stage production.

*[[Theatrical scenery|Sets and sceneries]] have to be designed and created in the [[workshop]]. They include outdoor and indoor scenes, or special types of constructions, and must also usually achieve the appearance of depth and distance within the spatial limitations of the [[Stage (theatre)|stage]].
*[[Stage lighting]] has to be provided to set the moods and sensitivities of the play, and to permit the showing of the emotional charge in the face of the actors, possibly reinforcing the pallor or vividness of their faces.
*[[Costume design|Costumes]] have to typify characters from the moment they appear on stage and signify the period or the social milieu in which the characters are to be seen. They can also indicate the characters' circumstances (whether they should appear rich or poor) or even whether they should be seen as [[comedy|comic]] or [[tragedy|tragic]] personae.
*[[Sound design|Sound effect]]s have to convey natural phenomena, such as wind or storm. However, it is also their function to call forth moods and feelings the audience will recognise.
*[[Special effect]]s have to deliver the imitations of physical actions on stage, such as explosions, fireworks, fog, or even earthquakes that are often part of the story.
*'''Rigging''' is an important aspect that is not often visible. All sound and lighting features and their cabling and wiring have to be held in a safe position, above both the stage and the auditorium, and therefore require specialist temporary and permanent fittings to be installed.
*The [[technical director]], especially in larger theatres, has the responsibility of overseeing the rigging and construction of the stage scenery. They create working drawings from the scenic designer‚Äôs drawings in order to pass on the designs to the scene shop.

==Trends and movements==

===The three unities===
The ''[[Classical unities]]'' of time, action and place were the main principles of French [[neoclassicism|neo-classical]] [[drama]] during part of the 17th century.&lt;br&gt;They were introduced by [[Jean Mairet]] after a misreading of [[Aristotle]]'s ''Poetics'', and the critic [[Lodovico Castelvetro|Castelvetro]] insisted that playwrights and directors adhere to the unities. In the ''Poetics'' Aristotle had merely  recommended that action should consist only of the main [[Plot (narrative)|plot]] without any [[subplot]]s, and that the time represented by action should not stretch beyond the length of one day. Time merely entered into his recommendations as a hint as to the limits of the [[attention]] span the audience could be expected to have. The unity of place, that of the confinement of the action in a play to one locality only, was not mentioned at all.&lt;br&gt;The effect of the three unities on French drama during this period was that their presentation became very restrictive, and it was only when later dramatists began to avoid mentioning specific times and places that the presentation of plays became more creative again.

==Theatre presentation==

Some [[dramatist]]s and dramaturgists try to achieve particular effects that are not normally sought in a theatre presentation.

===Defamiliarization effect (Verfremdungseffekt)===
[[Bertolt Brecht]] coined the term "defamiliarization effect" (sometimes called "estrangement effect" or "alienation effect"; German ''[[Verfremdungseffekt]]'') for an approach to theater that focused on the central ideas and decisions in the play, and discouraged involving the audience in an illusory world and in the emotions of the characters. Brecht thought the audience required an emotional distance to reflect on what is being presented. See [[epic theater]].

==Teichoscopy==

One of the oldest techniques that has been used often, is that of ''[[teichoscopy]]'' or the "viewing from the wall", in which actors observe events beyond the confines of the stage, such as a distant battle, and discuss it on stage while the battle is taking place, as opposed to the event being reported by messengers at a later time after the event has happened. [[Shakespeare]] uses this technique in the final scenes of the play Julius Ceasre''[[Julius Caesar (play)|Julius Caesar]]''.

The United States '''anti-abortion movement''' (or the '''pro-life movement''' or '''right-to-life movement''') contains elements opposing elective or therapeutic abortion on both moral and sectarian grounds and supports its legal prohibition or restriction. Advocates generally argue that human life begins at [[Fertilisation|conception]] and that the human [[zygote]] (or [[embryo]] or [[fetus]]) is a [[person]] and therefore has a [[right to life]]. The anti-abortion movement includes a [[List of anti-abortion organizations in the United States|variety of organizations]], with no single centralized decision-making body.&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia of women in American politics"/&gt; There are diverse arguments and rationales for the anti-abortion stance. Some anti-abortion activists concede arguments for permissible abortions, including therapeutic abortions, in exceptional circumstances such as incest, rape, severe fetal defects or when the woman's health is at risk.

Before the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] 1973 decisions in ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'' and ''[[Doe v. Bolton]]'', anti-abortion views predominated and found expression in [[U.S. state|state]] laws which prohibited or restricted abortions in a variety of ways. (See [[Abortion in the United States]].) The anti-abortion movement became politically active and dedicated to the reversal of the ''Roe v. Wade'' decision, which struck down most state laws restricting abortion in the first trimester of pregnancy.&lt;ref name=Staggenborg&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3oRBOuEvz30C&amp;pg=PA188 |page=188 |title=The Pro-Choice Movement: Organization and Activism in the Abortion Conflict |first=Suzanne |last=Staggenborg |publisher=Oxford University Press US |year=1994 |isbn=0-19-508925-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.brennancenter.org/blog/archives/Greenhouse_and_Reva_B._Siegel |page= |title=Before Roe v.

In the United States, the movement is associated with several Christian religious groups, especially the [[Catholic Church and abortion in the United States|Catholic Church]], and is frequently, but not exclusively, allied with the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Mc1bdEtBWRYC&amp;pg=PA150 |page=150 |title=Understanding American Government |publisher=Cengage Learning |year=2009 |edition=12 |isbn=0-495-56839-2 |author1=Susan Welch |author2=John Gruhl |author3=John Comer |author4=Susan M.

Wade'' and to promote legislative changes or constitutional amendments, such as the [[Human Life Amendment]], that prohibit or at least broadly restrict abortion.&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia of women in American politics"/&gt;

On the other side of the [[Abortion in the United States|abortion debate in the United States]] is the [[United States abortion-rights movement|abortion-rights movement]] (also called the pro-choice movement), which argues that pregnant women should have the right to choose whether or not to have an abortion.

==History==
In the late 1960s, a number of [[List of anti-abortion organizations in the United States|organizations]] were formed to mobilize opinion against the legalization of abortion. In the United States, the [[National Right to Life Committee]] was formed in 1968, while in Australia, the [[Cherish Life Queensland|National Right to Life]] formed in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=We need your help|url=http://www.cherishlife.org.au/about-us/help-needed|publisher=[[Cherish Life Queensland]]|accessdate=31 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The description "pro-life" was adopted by the [[Right to life|right-to-life]] (anti-abortion) movement in the United States following the Supreme Court 1973 decision ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'',&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia of women in American politics"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LOzfQEP3H8AC&amp;pg=PA195 |page=195 |title=Encyclopedia of women in American politics |first1= Jeffrey D. |last1=Schultz |first2=Laura A. |last2=Van Assendelft |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group |year=1999 |isbn=1-57356-131-2 |series=The American political landscape |edition=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; which held that a woman may terminate her pregnancy prior to the viability of the fetus outside of the womb and may also terminate her pregnancy "subsequent to viability&amp;nbsp;... for the preservation of the life or health of the mother."&lt;ref name="Roe v Wade"&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/historics/USSC_CR_0410_0113_ZS.html ''Roe v. Wade'' (98‚Äì1856) 410 U.S. 113 (1973)]. Retrieved April 29, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The term "pro-life" was adopted instead of "anti-abortion" to highlight their proponents' belief that abortion is the taking of a human life, rather than an issue concerning the restriction of women's [[reproductive rights]].&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia of women in American politics"/&gt; The first organized action was initiated by U.S. Catholic bishops who recommended in 1973 that the U.S. Constitution should be amended to ban abortion.&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia of women in American politics"/&gt;

''Roe v. Wade'' was considered a major setback by anti-abortion campaigners. The case and the overturning of most anti-abortion laws spurred the growth of a largely religious-based anti-abortion political and social movement, even as Americans were becoming, in the 1970s and 1980s, increasingly pro-choice. The first major anti-abortion success since ''Roe's case'' came in 1976 with the passing of the [[Hyde Amendment]] prohibiting the use of certain federal funds for abortions.  In ''[[Harris v. McRae]]'', anti-abortion advocates won a 1980 challenge to the Hyde Amendment. That same year, the anti-abortion movement gained control of the Republican Party's [[Party platform|platform]] committee, adding anti-abortion planks to the Republican position, and calling for a Human Life Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, banning abortion.&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia of women in American politics"/&gt; Four anti-abortion U.S. Presidents&amp;nbsp;‚Äì [[Ronald Reagan]], [[George H. W. Bush]], [[George W. Bush]], and [[Donald Trump]]&amp;nbsp;‚Äì were elected.

Some in the media have noted a revitalization of the anti-abortion movement in the 21st century. In 2011, [[Fred Barnes (journalist)|Fred Barnes]] of ''[[The Weekly Standard]]'' wrote:

{{blockquote|That the pro-life movement is bigger is a given. It's also younger, increasingly entrepreneurial, more strategic in its thinking, better organized, tougher in dealing with allies and enemies alike, almost wildly ambitious, and more relentless than ever. Pro-lifers have captured the high moral ground, chiefly thanks to advances in the quality of [[Medical ultrasonography|sonograms]]. Once fuzzy, sonograms now provide a high-resolution picture of the unborn child in the womb. Fetuses have become babies.&lt;ref name="TWS"/&gt;}}

Barnes also discussed the rise in opposition to abortion among the younger generations, especially the [[Generation Y|millennials]], the prevalence of crisis pregnancy centers, and the rejuvenation of old anti-abortion groups, such as [[Students for Life]], and the rise of new ones, such as [[40 Days for Life]] and [[Live Action (organization)|Live Action]].&lt;ref name="TWS"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.weeklystandard.com/articles/hidden-persuaders_604174.html?page=1 |title=Hidden Persuaders |publisher=Weeklystandard.com |date=2011-11-07 |accessdate=2011-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lisa Miller of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' wrote about the younger, more feminine face of the anti-abortion movement with the rise of leaders such as [[Lila Rose]] of Live Action, [[Marjorie Dannenfelser]] of the [[Susan B. Anthony List]], [[Charmaine Yoest]] of [[Americans United for Life]], Penny Nance of [[Concerned Women for America]], and Kristan Hawkins of [[Students for Life]], all "youngish Christian working mothers with children at home" who seek to combat the image of the anti-abortion movement as made up of "old white men" who cannot relate to the experience of pregnant women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/on-faith/a-feminine-face-for-the-anti-abortion-movement/2011/11/02/gIQAwd7kiM_story.html |title=A feminine face for the anti-abortion movement |publisher=Washingtonpost.com |date=2011-10-24 |accessdate=2011-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The anti-abortion movement has been successful in recent years in promoting new laws against abortion within the states. The [[Guttmacher Institute]] said eighty laws restricting abortion were passed in the first six months of 2011, "more than double the previous record of 34 abortion restrictions enacted in 2005‚Äîand more than triple the 23 enacted in 2010".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guttmacher.org/media/inthenews/2011/07/13/index.html |title=States Enact Record Number of Abortion Restrictions in First Half of 2011 |publisher=Guttmacher.org |date=2011-07-13 |accessdate=2011-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
{{See also|Abortion debate|Ethical aspects of abortion|Emergency contraception}}
The anti-abortion movement includes a [[List of anti-abortion organizations in the United States|variety of organizations]], with no single centralized decision-making body.&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia of women in American politics"/&gt; There are diverse arguments and rationales for the anti-abortion stance.

There are many socially conservative organizations in the U.S. that support the anti-abortion movement. Some groups focus solely on promoting the anti-abortion cause, such as [[American Life League]], the [[Susan B. Anthony List]], [[National Right to Life Committee]], [[Americans United for Life]], and [[Live Action (organization)|Live Action]], among many others. Other groups support not only the anti-abortion cause but the broader [[family values]] cause, such as [[Family Research Council]], [[Focus on the Family]], [[American Family Association]], and [[Concerned Women for America]], among many others.

Abortion opponents generally believe that human life should be valued either from [[fertilization]] or [[implantation (human embryo)|implantation]] until natural death. The contemporary anti-abortion movement is typically, but not exclusively, influenced by [[Christian right|conservative Christian]] beliefs, especially in the United States, and has influenced certain strains of bioethical utilitarianism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Holland, S. |year=2003 |title=Bioethics: a Philosophical Introduction |location=Cambridge |publisher=Polity Press }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{vague|reason=Both uses of "influence" in this sentence provide little actual information.|date=July 2018}} From that viewpoint, any action which destroys an [[embryo]] or [[fetus]] kills a [[person]]. Any deliberate destruction of human life is considered ethically or morally wrong and is not considered to be mitigated by any benefits to others, as such benefits are coming at the expense of the life of what they believe to be a person. In some cases, this belief extends to opposing abortion of fetuses that would almost certainly expire within a short time after birth, such as [[anencephaly|anencephalic]] fetuses.

Some abortion opponents also oppose certain forms of [[birth control]], particularly [[hormonal contraception]] such as [[emergency contraception]] (ECPs), and copper IUDs which prevent the [[implantation (human embryo)|implantation]] of an embryo. Because they believe that the term "[[Beginning of pregnancy controversy|pregnancy]]" should be defined so as to begin at fertilization, they refer to these [[contraceptive]]s as [[abortifacients]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Finn |first=J.T. |title="Birth Control" Pills cause early Abortions |work=Pro-life America ‚Äî Facts on Abortion |publisher=prolife.com |date=2005-04-23 |url=http://www.prolife.com/BIRTHCNT.html |accessdate=2009-01-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; because they cause the embryo to starve. An embryo gets its nourishment off the uterine wall and dies if not attached. The Catholic Church endorses this view,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Emergency 'Contraception' and Early Abortion |publisher=United States Conference of Catholic Bishops |date=1998-08-01 |url=http://www.usccb.org/prolife/issues/abortion/fact1098.shtml |accessdate=2009-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the possibility that hormonal contraception has post-fertilization effects is disputed within the scientific community, including some anti-abortion physicians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Susan A. |last=Crockett |author2=Donna Harrison |author3=Joe DeCook |author4=Camilla Hersh  |title=Hormone Contraceptives Controversies and Clarifications |publisher=American Association of Pro Life Obstetricians and Gynecologists |date = April 1999|url=http://www.aaplog.org/position-and-papers/oral-contraceptive-controversy/hormone-contraceptives-controversies-and-clarifications/ |accessdate=2011-02-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Attachment to an anti-abortion position is often but not exclusively connected to religious beliefs about the [[sanctity of life]] (see also [[culture of life]]). Exclusively [[secular humanism|secular-humanist]] positions against abortion tend to be a minority viewpoint{{citation needed|reason=While the majority of self-identified pro-lifers are religious, that doesn't mean they justify their opposition to abortion using religious grounds.|date=July 2018}} among anti-abortion advocates; these groups say that their position is based on human rights and biology, rather than religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.godlessprolifers.org/home.html |title=Atheist and Agnostic Pro-Life League Homepage |accessdate=November 4, 2006 |last=Wallace |first=James Matthew}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://secularprolife.org/ |title=Secular ProLife |accessdate=2010-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catholicworldreport.com/Item/1909/atheist_secular_and_prolife.aspx]"Atheist, Secular, and Pro-life"&lt;/ref&gt; Some holding the anti-abortion position also hold a [[complementarianism|complementarian]] view of [[gender roles]], though there is also a self-described [[feminism|feminist]] element inside the movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Feminists for Life  |url=http://www.feministsforlife.org/who/aboutus.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Views in opposition to abortion==
{{See also|Religion and abortion|Sanctity of life|Culture of life}}
The variety in opinion on the issue of abortion is reflected in the diverse views of religious groups. For example, the Catholic Church considers all procured abortions morally evil,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p3s2c2a5.htm ''Catechism of the Catholic Church''] para.2271, "Since the first century the Church has affirmed the moral evil of every procured abortion. This teaching has not changed and remains unchangeable. Direct abortion, that is to say, abortion willed either as an end or a means, is gravely contrary to the moral law: 'You shall not kill the embryo by abortion and shall not cause the newborn to perish'". Vatican website. Accessed 2011-02-05.&lt;/ref&gt; while traditional Jewish teaching sanctions abortion if necessary to safeguard the life and well-being of the pregnant woman.&lt;ref name=PewForum&gt;{{cite web|author=ANALYSIS September 30, 2008 |url=http://pewforum.org/docs/?DocID=351 |title=Pew Forums |publisher=Pewforum.org |date=2008-09-30 |accessdate=2011-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The only coordinated opposition to abortion in the United States during the early 1970s  before the ''Roe v. Wade'' decision was from the [[United States Conference of Catholic Bishops]] and its Family Life Bureau. Mobilization of a wide-scale anti-abortion movement began immediately after in 1973 with the creation of the [[National Right to Life Committee]] (NRLC).&lt;ref name="Munson2008"&gt;{{cite book|last=Munson|first=Ziad W. |title=The making of pro-life activists: how social movement mobilization works|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UFaCtYtIAjgC&amp;pg=PA85|accessdate=31 December 2011|year=2008|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-55120-3|page=85}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before 1980, the [[Southern Baptist Convention]] officially advocated for loosening of abortion restrictions.&lt;ref name=balmer2&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=LSO5YDifWz8C&amp;pg=PA209&amp;vq=history+baptist+abortion&amp;sig=KZgjPsS22v-Yl0bLPRrl6eu-Etk#PPA12,M1 ''They Kingdom Come''] pg. 12, a book by Randall Herbert Balmer, Professor of Religion and History at [[Columbia University]].&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1971 and 1974 Southern Baptist Conventions, Southern Baptists were called upon "to work for legislation that will allow the possibility of abortion under such conditions as rape, incest, clear evidence of severe fetal deformity, and carefully ascertained evidence of the likelihood of damage to the emotional, mental, and physical health of the mother."&lt;ref name=balmer2 /&gt; W. Barry Garrett wrote in the ''[[Baptist Press]]'', "Religious liberty, human equality and justice are advanced by the &lt;nowiki&gt;[Roe v. Wade]&lt;/nowiki&gt; Supreme Court abortion decision."&lt;ref name=balmer2 /&gt; By 1980, conservative Protestant leaders became vocal in their opposition to legalized abortion,&lt;ref name=balmer&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=LSO5YDifWz8C&amp;pg=PA209&amp;vq=history+baptist+abortion&amp;sig=KZgjPsS22v-Yl0bLPRrl6eu-Etk#PPA12,M1 ''They Kingdom Come'']  a book by Randall Herbert Balmer, Professor of Religion and History at [[Columbia University]].&lt;/ref&gt; and by the early 1990s [[Pat Robertson]]'s [[Christian Coalition of America]] became a significant anti-abortion organization.&lt;ref name=mckee&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = McKeegan | first1 = M | year = 1993 | title = The politics of abortion: A historical perspective | url = | journal = Women's Health Issues | volume = 3 | issue = 3| pages = 127‚Äì131 | doi=10.1016/s1049-3867(05)80245-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, [[Richard Land]], president of the Southern Baptist Convention's [[Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission]], said that making abortion illegal is more important than any other issue.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bpnews.net/bpnews.asp?ID=22064 Baptist Press] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110615032610/http://www.bpnews.net/bpnews.asp?ID=22064 |date=2011-06-15 }}"Sparks fly in Land's appearance at black columnists' meeting"&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of the anti-abortion movement in the United States and around the world finds support in the [[Catholicism and abortion|Roman Catholic Church]], the [[Christian right]], the [[Lutheran Church‚ÄìMissouri Synod]] and the [[Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod]], the [[Church of England]], the [[Anglican Church in North America]], the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]], and [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R9UNAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA509 |title=Mapping the Social Landscape|publisher=|accessdate=28 June 2015|isbn=9780767406161|author1=Ferguson|first1=Susan J|year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=info:sZdDDkTKT_EJ:scholar.google.com/&amp;output=viewport&amp;pg=1&amp;hl=en Sex, Politics, and Religion: The Clash Between Poland and the European Union over Abortion] by Alicia Czerwinski in the ''Denver Journal of International Law and Policy'', 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mospat.ru/index.php?mid=192 |title=–û—Ñ–∏—Ü–∏–∞–ª—å–Ω—ã–π —Å–∞–π—Ç –†—É—Å—Å–∫–æ–π –ü—Ä–∞–≤–æ—Å–ª–∞–≤–Ω–æ–π –¶–µ—Ä–∫–≤–∏ |publisher=Mospat.ru |accessdate=2011-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://library.lds.org/nxt/gateway.dll/Curriculum/home%20and%20family.htm/true%20to%20the%20faith%20a%20gospel%20reference.htm/abortion.htm?f=templates$fn=document-frame.htm$3.0$q=$x= True to the Faith (LDS) article on abortion]. Retrieved 2006-05-06.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the anti-abortion teachings of these denominations vary considerably.  The Eastern Orthodox Church and Roman Catholic Church consider abortion to be immoral in all cases, but may in some cases permit an act {{citation needed|date=June 2012}}&lt;!-- Murder is allowable only if the aggressor is unjustly attacking and there is no other way to survive --&gt; which indirectly and without intent results in the death of the fetus in a case where the mother's life is threatened. In Pope John Paul II's Letter to Families he simply stated the Roman Catholic Church's view on abortion and [[euthanasia]]: "Laws which legitimize the direct killing of innocent human beings through abortion or euthanasia are in complete opposition to the inviolable right to life proper to every individual; they thus deny the equality of everyone before the law."

The [[National Association of Evangelicals]] has adopted a number of resolutions stating its opposition to abortion, but "recognizes that there might be situations in which terminating a pregnancy is warranted ‚Äì such as protecting the life of a mother or in cases of rape or incest."&lt;ref name=pew&gt;[http://pewforum.org/docs/?DocID=351 Religious Groups' Official Positions on Abortion], [[Pew Research Center]] (January 16, 2013).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nae.net/abortion-2/|title=Resolution on Abortion|date=2010 |publisher=[[National Association of Evangelicals]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The position of the [[Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church) is that "elective abortion for personal or social convenience is contrary to the will and the commandments of God" but that abortion may be justified where the pregnancy endangers life of the mother, or where the pregnancy is the outcome of rape or incest.&lt;ref name=pew/&gt; The [[Taskforce of United Methodists on Abortion and Sexuality]] (TUMAS) was formed in 1987 to further the anti-abortion ministry in [[The United Methodist Church]].&lt;ref name="Thomas C. Oden"&gt;{{cite book|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=pB6BrgQRjbQC&amp;pg=PA143 | title = The rebirth of orthodoxy: signs of new life in Christianity|publisher = [[HarperCollins]]|accessdate = 2009-01-04|isbn = 978-0-06-009785-1|date = 2002-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Southern Baptist Convention]] believes that abortion is allowable only in cases where there is a direct threat to the life of the woman.&lt;ref name=pew/&gt;

Among [[Mainline Protestant]] denominations, the [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America|Episcopal Church]] recognizes a right of a pregnant woman to terminate a pregnancy, but opposes "abortion as a means of birth control, family planning, sex selection or any reason of mere convenience."&lt;ref name=pew/&gt; The [[United Church of Christ]] supports abortion rights, viewing it as a matter of reproductive health and justice.&lt;ref name=pew/&gt; The [[Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.)]] adopts the view that abortion is a personal choice, but acknowledges "diverse conclusions and actions" within the church on the issue.&lt;ref name=pew/&gt; The [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in America]]'s position is that abortion prior to the point of viability "should not be prohibited by law or by lack of public funding" but that "abortion after the point of fetal viability should be prohibited except when the life of a mother is threatened or when fetal abnormalities pose a fatal threat to a newborn."&lt;ref name=pew/&gt;

===Consistent life ethic===
Supporters of the [[consistent life ethic]] also oppose abortions as one of the acts that end human life. In 1979, [[Juli Loesch]] linked anti-abortion and anti-nuclear weapons arguments to form the group Pro Lifers for Survival. In 1987 this group defined an ethic of the sanctity of all life, and formed the group Seamless Garment Network. This group was against abortion, euthanasia, [[capital punishment]], militarism, poverty and racism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=z5V9t5b79TwC&amp;pg=PA216 |page=216 |title=Catholic Social Teaching and Movements |first=Marvin L. |last=Krier Mich |publisher=Twenty-Third Publications |year=1998 |isbn=9780896229365}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in 1983, American [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Catholic Cardinal]] [[Joseph Bernardin]] argued that abortion, euthanasia, capital punishment, and unjust war are all related, and all wrong. He said that "to be truly 'pro-life,' you have to take all of those issues into account."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wNjQaPGdlaMC&amp;pg=PA148 |page=148 |title=The Edge of Life: Human Dignity and Contemporary Bioethics |first=Christopher Robert |last=Kaczor |publisher=Springer |year=2006 |isbn=9781402031564 |series=Philosophy and Medicine |volume=85}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paul M.

''[[The New York Times]]'' reported in 2011 that the anti-abortion movement in the United States has been undergoing a disagreement over tactics. Since ''Roe v. Wade'' was decided in 1973, the movement has usually focused on chipping away at ''Roe'' through incremental restrictions such as laws requiring parental consent or women to see sonograms, restricting late-term abortions, etc., with the goal of limiting abortions and changing "hearts and minds" until there is a majority on the Supreme Court to overturn ''Roe''. However, some activists are calling for "an all-out legal assault on ''Roe. v. Wade''", seeking the enactment of laws defining legal personhood as beginning at fertilization or prohibiting abortions after a fetal heartbeat is detectable at six to eight weeks in the hope that court challenges to such laws would lead the Supreme Court to overturn ''Roe v. Wade''. They believe that Justice [[Anthony Kennedy]], who nearly decided to overturn ''Roe'' in ''[[Planned Parenthood v. Casey]]'', is open to rethinking ''Roe''. Others fear that the Court would not only strike down the laws in question but other state laws as well, and take the opportunity to solidify the ruling in ''Roe''. Evangelical Christian groups tend to be in the former camp and Catholic groups in the latter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |work=The New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/05/health/policy/fetal-heartbeat-bill-splits-anti-abortion-forces.html |title=Anti-Abortion Groups Are Split on Legal Tactics |date=December 4, 2011 |first=Erik |last=Eckholm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Demographics==
Studies indicate that activists within the American anti-abortion movement are predominantly white and educated, with a majority of anti-abortion activism constituted by women. Scholars continue to dispute the primary factors that cause individuals to become anti-abortion activists. While some have suggested that a particular moral stance or worldview leads to activism, others have suggested that activism leads individuals to develop particular moral positions and worldviews.

A 1981 survey of dues paying members of the National Right to Life Committee (NRLC) by sociologist Donald O. Granberg found that survey respondents held conservative views on sex, sex education, and contraception. Additionally, Granberg's survey provided basic demographic characteristics of his sample: 98% of survey respondents were white, 63% were female, 58% had a college degree, and 70% were Catholic.  Granberg concluded that conservative personal morality was the primary mechanism for explaining an individual's involvement in the anti-abortion movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|jstor=2134620 | volume=13 | pages=157‚Äì163}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2002 study by Carol J.C. Maxwell drawing on decades of survey and interview data of direct-action activists within the anti-abortion movement found that 99% of the sample was white, 60% was female, 51% had a college degree, and 29% were Catholic.  Like Granberg's 1981 study, Maxwell concluded that anti-abortion and pro-choice activists held two different worldviews which in turn are formed by two different moral centers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Maxwell|first=Carol J.C.|title=Pro-life activists in America |publisher=Cambridge University Press |date=2002 |isbn=0521660440}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, sociologist Ziad Munson studied the characteristics of both activists and non-activists who considered themselves anti-abortion. The anti-abortion activists of Munson's sample were 93% white, 57% female, 66% Catholic, and 71% had a college degree. Of non-activists who considered themselves anti-abortion, Munson found that 83% were white, 52% were female, 45% were Catholic, and 76% had a college degree.  In Munson's analysis personal moralities and worldviews are formed as a consequence of participation in anti-abortion activism.  Munson's analysis differs from previous scholarly work in its assertion that beliefs result from activism rather than causing activism. For Munson, life course factors make an individual more or less likely to become an activist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Munson|first=Ziad |title=The making of pro-life activists |publisher=University of Chicago Press |date=2008 |isbn=0226551202}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a 2013 Gallup poll, fifteen percent of Americans with no religious identity are anti-abortion and slight majorities of Catholics, Protestants, Southerners, seniors and nonwhites reported as anti-abortion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/162548/americans-misjudge-abortion-views.aspx|title=Americans Misjudge U.S. Abortion Views|first=Gallup,|last=Inc.|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversies over terminology ==
{{Main|Abortion debate#Terminology}}
Anti-abortion advocates tend to use terms such as "unborn baby", "unborn child", or "pre-born child",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Chamberlain | first1 = Pam | last2 = Hardisty | first2 = Jean | year = 2007 | title = The Importance of the Political 'Framing' of Abortion | url = http://www.publiceye.org/magazine/v14n1/ReproPatriarch-07.html | journal = The Public Eye Magazine | volume = 14 | issue = 1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/05/weekinreview/05greenhouse.html?scp=1&amp;sq=infanticide "The Roberts Court Takes on Abortion".] ''New York Times.''

Both "pro-choice" and "pro-life" are examples of terms labeled as [[framing (social sciences)|political framing]]: they are terms which purposely try to define their philosophies in the best possible light, while by definition attempting to describe their opposition in the worst possible light. "Pro-choice" implies that the alternative viewpoint is "anti-choice", while "pro-life" implies the alternative viewpoint is "pro-death" or "anti-life".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rnclife.org/reports/2009/spring/RNC-Spring09.pdf |title=Example of "anti-life" terminology |format=PDF |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727221643/http://www.rnclife.org/reports/2009/spring/RNC-Spring09.pdf |archive-date=2011-07-27 |accessdate=2011-11-16 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some right-to-lifers use the term "pro-abort" to refer to pro-choice organizations and individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lifesitenews.com/news/horror-mob-of-topless-pro-abort-feminists-attacks-rosary-praying-men-defend|title=Horror: Violent mob of topless pro-abort feminists attacks praying men defending cathedral (VIDEO)|work=LifeSiteNews|accessdate=28 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Associated Press]] encourages journalists to use the terms "abortion rights" and "anti-abortion".&lt;ref&gt;Goldstein, Norm, ed. The Associated Press Stylebook. Philadelphia: Basic Books, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2009 [[Gallup Poll]], a majority of U.S. adults (51%) called themselves "pro-life" on the issue of abortion‚Äîfor the first time since Gallup began asking the question in 1995‚Äîwhile 42% identified themselves as "pro-choice",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Lydia|last=Saad|title=More Americans "Pro-Life" Than "Pro-Choice" for First TimeAlso, fewer think abortion should be legal "under any circumstances"|date=May 15, 2009|publisher=Gallup, Inc|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/118399/More-Americans-Pro-Life-Than-Pro-Choice-First-Time.aspx|accessdate=2011-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; although pro-choice groups noted that acceptance of the "pro-life" label did not in all cases indicate opposition to legalized abortion, and that another recent poll had indicated that an equal number were pro-choice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/30771408/ns/us_news-life/ |agency=Associated Press |title=Majority of Americans now ‚Äòpro-life,‚Äô poll says |date=May 15, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; A March 2011 [[Rasmussen Reports]] poll concluded that Americans are "closely divided between those who call themselves pro-life" and those who consider themselves as "pro-choice".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Americans Think New State Laws Will Reduce Number of Abortions|date=March 10, 2011|publisher=Rasmussen Reports, LLC|url=http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/current_events/abortion/americans_think_new_state_laws_will_reduce_number_of_abortions|accessdate=2011-03-15|quote=While the country remains closely divided between those who call themselves pro-life and those who view themselves as pro-choice, the majority of Likely U.S. Voters think abortion is morally wrong in most cases.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a February 2011 Rasmussen Reports poll of "Likely U.S. Voters", fifty percent view themselves as

== Methods and activities ==

===Demonstrations and protests===
* '''Mass demonstrations''': every year, American anti-abortion advocates hold a [[March for Life (Washington, D.C.)|March for Life]] in Washington, D.C., on 22 January, the anniversary date of the ''Roe v. Wade'' Supreme Court decision legalizing abortion in the United States. The event typically draws tens of thousands of attendees&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Frank Somerville|author2=Richard O'Mara|title=Keeler exhorts March for Life crowd|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1995-01-24/news/1995024019_1_abortion-march-for-life-keeler|accessdate=12 July 2018|work=[[The Baltimore Sun]]|date=January 24, 1997|quote=The U.S. Park Police estimated 45,000 people marched, about 10,000 more than last year.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Keyes|first1=Allison|title=Anti-Abortion 'March For Life' Draws Thousands In Washington|url=https://www.npr.org/2013/01/25/170299274/anti-abortion-march-for-life-draws-thousands-in-washington|accessdate=12 July 2018|date=January 25, 2013|quote=Tens of thousands of anti-abortion protesters gathered on the National Mall on Friday to mark the 40th anniversary of the Roe v. Wade decision that legalized abortion.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, since 2003, frequently features notable politicians as speakers. Similar events take place on a smaller scale in other U.S. cities, such as the [[Walk for Life West Coast|Walk for Life]] in [[San Francisco]], California.
* '''The [[Life Chain|life chain]]:''' The "Life Chain" is a public demonstration technique that involves standing in a row on sidewalks holding signs bearing anti-abortion messages. Messages include "Abortion Kills Children", "Abortion stops a beating heart" or "Abortion Hurts Women". Participants, as an official policy, do not yell or chant slogans and do not block pedestrians or roadways.  Many [[Right to Life]] chapters hold Life Chain events yearly&lt;ref&gt;http://nationallifechain.org Retrieved 25 September 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; and the annual worldwide [[40 Days For Life|40 Days for Life]] campaigns also use this technique.
* '''The rescue''': A "rescue operation" involves anti-abortion activists blocking the entrances to an [[abortion clinic]] in order to prevent anyone from entering. The stated goal of this practice is to force the clinic to shut down for the day. Often, the protesters are removed by law enforcement. Some clinics were protested so heavily in this fashion that they closed down permanently. "The rescue" was first attempted by [[Operation Save America|Operation Rescue]]. Ever since President [[Bill Clinton]] signed the [[Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act]] into law, the rescue has become prohibitively expensive, and has rarely been attempted.
* '''The truth display''': Involves publicly displaying large pictures of aborted fetuses. Some anti-abortion groups believe that showing the graphic results of abortion is an effective way to dissuade and prevent others from choosing abortion. The [[Pro-life Action League]] has used this form of activism in its ''Face the Truth'' displays. Members of one group, [[Survivors of the Abortion Holocaust]], are known for setting up truth displays on [[university]] campuses.  This group has faced legal battles over the use of such graphic imagery, and they have generated debate regarding the protection of such displays, by freedom of speech. "Truth displays" are controversial, even within the anti-abortion movement.&lt;ref&gt;Pavone, Frank A.[http://www.priestsforlife.org/articles/shouldweuse.htm "Should We Use Graphic Images?"] ''Priests for Life'' Retrieved September 7, 2007. Quote: "Even among those who oppose abortion, answers to this question [Should we use graphic images?] vary".&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Picketing (protest)|Picketing]]''': The majority of the facilities that perform abortions in the United States experience some form of protest from anti-abortion demonstrators every year, of which the most common form is picketing. In 2007, 11,113 instances of picketing were either reported to, or obtained by, the [[National Abortion Federation]].&lt;ref name="naf"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.prochoice.org/pubs_research/publications/downloads/about_abortion/violence_statistics.pdf |title=NAF Violence and Disruption Statistics |format=PDF |accessdate=2008-07-28 |publisher=National Abortion Federation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Counseling===
* '''[[Sidewalk counseling]]''': "Sidewalk counseling" is a form of anti-abortion advocacy which is conducted outside of [[abortion clinic]]s. Activists seek to communicate with those entering the building, or with passersby in general, in an effort to persuade them not to have an [[abortion]] or to reconsider their position on the [[abortion debate|morality of abortion]].&lt;ref name="hillvcolorado"&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/98-1856.ZO.html#FN2 Hill v. Colorado (98-1856) 530 U.S. 703 (2000)]. Retrieved December 13, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; They do so by trying to engage in conversation, displaying signs, distributing [[Pamphlet|literature]], or giving directions to a nearby [[crisis pregnancy center]].&lt;ref name="hillvcolorado" /&gt; 
** The "Chicago Method" is an approach to sidewalk counseling that involves giving those about to enter an abortion facility copies of [[lawsuit]]s filed against the facility or its [[physician]]s. The name comes from the fact that it was first used by [[Pro-life Action League]] in [[Chicago]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prolifeaction.org/news/2002v21n2/controversy.htm "Controversy in the Activist Movement", ''Pro-Life Action News'', August 2000] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070618210651/http://www.prolifeaction.org/news/2002v21n2/controversy.htm |date=2007-06-18 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; The intent of the Chicago Method is to turn the woman away from a facility that the protesters deem "unsafe", thus giving her time to reconsider her choice to abort.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.priestsforlife.org/articles/chicagomethod.html "The "Chicago Method": Sidewalk Counseling that appeals to the Mother's concerns for her own well-being," Priests for Life].&lt;/ref&gt;{{primary source inline|date=October 2012}}

===Specialty license plates===
In the United States, some states issue [[Vehicle registration plates of the United States#Vanity and specialty plates|specialty license plates]] that have an anti-abortion theme. [[Choose Life (organization)|Choose Life]], an advocacy group founded in 1997, was successful in securing an anti-abortion automobile tag in Florida. Subsequently, the organization has been actively helping groups in other states pursue "Choose Life" license plates.&lt;ref&gt;Burge, Kathleen: [http://www.boston.com/news/local/articles/2006/05/05/driving_force/ "Driving force"] Boston Globe, May 5, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Madigan, Erin: [http://www.stateline.org/live/ViewPage.action?siteNodeId=136&amp;languageId=1&amp;contentId=15079 "Choose Life Car Tags Spark Debate"] Stateline.org, November 25, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

==Violence==
{{Main|Anti-abortion violence}}

Violent incidents directed against abortion providers have included [[arson]] and [[bomb]]ings of [[abortion clinic]]s, and [[murder]]s or [[attempted murder]]s of physicians and clinic staff, especially the doctors that provide abortions. Acts of violence against abortion providers and facilities in North America have largely subsided following a peak in the mid-1990s&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.religioustolerance.org/abo_viol.htm Violence at US Abortion Clinics].&lt;/ref&gt; which included the murders of Drs. [[David Gunn (doctor)|David Gunn]], [[John Britton (doctor)|John Britton]], and [[Barnett Slepian]] and the attempted murder of Dr. [[George Tiller]]. Tiller was [[assassination of George Tiller|murdered]] in his church in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/26/us/26tiller.html?ref=georgertiller "An Abortion Battle, Fought to the Death" NYT 25 July 2009], New York Times 25 July 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 1995, nearly all anti-abortion leaders said that they condemned the use of violence in the movement, describing it as an aberration and saying that no one in their organizations was associated with acts of violence.&lt;ref name=vio&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/national/longterm/abortviolence/stories/salvi3.htm |title=Clinic Killings Follow Years of Antiabortion Violence |publisher=Washingtonpost.com |date=1995-01-17 |accessdate=2011-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.cbn.com/cbnnews/us/2009/may/pro-life-community-condemns-tiller-shooting/ |title= Pro-life Leaders Respond to Tiller Shooting |publisher= cbn.com |date= 2009-06-01 |accessdate= 2014-10-13 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20141018135234/http://www.cbn.com/cbnnews/us/2009/may/pro-life-community-condemns-tiller-shooting/ |archivedate= 2014-10-18 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is, however, a small extremist fringe element of the right-to-life movement in the USA, which supports, raises money for, and attempts to justify anti-abortion violence, including murders of abortion workers, which the fringe element calls "justifiable homicides".&lt;ref&gt;James Risen and Judy L. Thomas: ''Wrath of Angels: The American Abortion War'', Basic Books, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.splcenter.org/get-informed/intelligence-report/browse-all-issues/1998/summer/anti-abortion-violence/the-signers&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/1944874/Anti-Abortion_Extremism_and_Violence_in_the_United_States|title=Anti-Abortion Extremism and Violence in the United States|author=Aaron Winter|publisher=|accessdate=28 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anti-abortion activists have been the targets of criminal intimidation{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} and violence, including the [[murder of Jim Pouillon]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/17/us/17abortion.html?_r=0 Memorial Held for Slain Anti-Abortion Protester] Damien Cave; New York Times Sept 16, 2009 ''His killing is believed to be the first of someone protesting abortion''&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Uwe Gustafsson''' (born 1938) is a [[Canadians|Canadian]] [[Missionary]], [[Scholar]], [[Linguist]] and [[social worker]] who stayed at [[Araku Valley]] of [[Vishakhapatnam District|Vishakhapatnam]] district, [[Andhra Pradesh]], [[South India]] for more than 43 years and changed the lives of more than 250,000 indigenous primitive tribal population (PTG) of [[Paderu]] [[Paderu (ST) (Assembly constituency)|Agency]] areas. Gustafsson compiled and written an Aadivasi Oriya-Telugu-English Dictionary and few scholastic and resourceful books and contributed to the work on Bible translation into Adivasi Oriya language. He worked primarily living at Araku Valley, Vishakhapatnam, [[Andhra Pradesh]], [[South India]]. He also was a social reformer and activist who lived with the primitive tribes (then, now they are not to be called by the name ‚Äúprimitive‚Äù) and changed them positively towards development, income, livelihood and empowerment in many life-basics and [[MDG]] indicators. He was associated with [[Summer Institute of Linguistics]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sil.org/system/files/reapdata/13/60/57/136057656517330160702897844358204091371/26473.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early years==
Uwe Gustafsson spent his early years of childhood in [[Canada]] where he completed his both secular and [[theological]] studies. He was ambitious and enthusiastic for social reform and learning the indigenous [[culture]], [[language]] and doing gospel works. His passion brought him to India; especially to the border areas of the states Andhra Pradesh and Orissa (now [[Odisha]]) where there were deep forests part of [[Eastern Ghats]] and forest dwelling/depending [[primitive tribes]].  There is still primitive-natured people living in the forests and the fringe villages and thus one can understand the situation some 43 years back and the same also exemplifies his dedication towards his passion.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rediff.com/news/2002/oct/02spec.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Journey to India==
In the first half of the 1960s Gustafsson came to India along with a team of social reformers and missionaries. Finding the backwardness, pathetic conditions and need of the forest-dwelling and depending tribal populations and their habitations, the team travelled to the forest areas of [[Araku Valley|Aaraku Valley]] and [[Paderu]] in [[Vishakhapatnam District|Vishakhapatnam]]. Owing to the hardships of living in the forest areas and the difficulties arisen, almost all the companions and members in the team had returned to their own hometowns. But he had stayed back and decided to work among the tribes and to help them in to have development in their [[Social|socio]]-[[education]]al, health, [[livelihood]] and [[economical]] backwardness.

==In Aaraku Valley==
In Aaraku Valley, he, along with his family (His wife Elke and son Andrew) stayed in one of the tribal families‚Äô house and started to study the culture, nature and language of the [[Tribes of India|tribes]]. His principle intension in staying at Aaraku Valley with the tribals, was to script the [[Indo-Aryan languages|oral languages of the tribes]]. There are over a 13 types of tribes occupying the Agency areas of Aaraku Valley extending to Paderu and the borders of Odisha state like [[Khonds]], [[Koya (tribe)|Koya]] and almost all of them speak the [[Adivasi Oriya language|Adivasi Oriya]] dialect.&lt;ref&gt;http://workspace.unpan.org/sites/internet/Documents/political%20ecy%20cess.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  During his stays‚Äô initial years the tribal population was experiencing a lot of issues and problems in [[Health care|health]], income, basic needs, food, livelihood, illiteracy, ignorance and social struggles too. He and his wife used to help the people in many ways; Mrs. Gustafsson ran a 24-hour medical clinic in their home to help the people even in the night. As his book of study ''Can Literacy Lead to Development?: A Case Study in Literacy, Adult Education, and Economic Development in India'' says, he started a mobile schooling programme; a bilingual literacy programme.&lt;ref&gt;http://bookvistas.com/BookDetails.aspx?BOOKID=40917/aboutbook&lt;/ref&gt; Under the programme, every year, they trained 100 Adivasi Oriya-speaking people to give night classes in 100 villages in and around the Araku Valley and thus both the Gustafssons‚Äô effort reached a coverage of 5000&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; area and total population of more than 12,000 men and women making them literate. Such activities became routine in both the Gustafssons‚Äô life and along with that he separated time to study the [[Odia languages|Adivasi Oriya Language]].

Though the Adivasi Oriya-Telugu Language was the language for the tribes for thousands of years had been spoken and the other languages of the states in which they live have scripts; [[Telugu language|Telugu]] and [[Oriya (language)|Oriya]], but they had no even [[Scripting language|script]]. So his next effort was to find a script for the Adivasi Oriya language, which is an [[Indo-Aryan languages|Indo-Aryan language]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sil.org/system/files/reapdata/13/60/57/136057656517330160702897844358204091371/26473.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; So he studied the script and sounds of another local language to re-apply to Adivasi Oriya. With a vision to help the tribal peoples to coalescence with the wider population, he chose [[Telugu language|Telugu]], the state language of [[Andhra Pradesh]] and [[Telangana]], in which states most of the [[Odia language|Adivasi ‚Äì Oriya language spoken tribes]] live.  Thus it took 20 years of tremendous and hard work even without computers or any such advanced devices, but using only two old type writers and with the help of two tribal people to assist him.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sil.org/system/files/reapdata/13/60/57/136057656517330160702897844358204091371/26473.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; By 2002 he had written, compiled and published a variety of scholarly books including ''Adivasi Oriya Language Script (Using Telugu Script)'', ''Adivasi Oriya-Telugu-English Dictionary'', English‚ÄìAdivasi Oriya vocabularies, and ''Kotiya‚ÄìOriya Phonetic Summary''. Among them the ''Adivasi Oriya-Telugu-English dictionary, a 1,047-page opus is the great work of Gustafsson in India, for it is the only basic for the tribal children and others‚Äô study and reference and is the written preservation of a language or an oral tongue, spoken over thousands years as mother tongue of one of the major tribal populations in Andhra Pradesh and Odisha.

Finding the need for an exclusive participation, oneness, social bonding and common platform and the [[literacy]], [[livelihood]] and other developmental activities further, it was he and his wife established the [http://indiaonwheel.blogspot.in/2012/03/araku-valley-culture-and-shopping.html AASSAV] (Aadivasi Abhivrudhi Samskrithika Sangam Aaraku Valley). Though the [[Non-governmental organization|society]] AASSAV was started in the late 1980s, the income generation and livelihood activities of AASSAV was started much earlier onwards by Gustafssons. Major income generation activities introduced and carried out by ASSAV includes [https://www.fivesenses.com.au/shop/coffee/category/single-origins/india-araku-valley-FTO coffee cultivation], [[Black pepper|black pepper cultivation]], [[cardamom]], [[beekeeping]], printing press etc. and a variety of additional activities too having a headquarters at Humbriguda, [[Araku valley]] over an eight-acre campus, where it has all basic infrastructure, shops and machineries too. It was he who introduced coffee and black pepper cultivation over the Agency areas and AASSAV's coffee-growing ventures expanded staff enrolling 1,000 tribal farmers in 80 different villages to use their one-acre plots to grow organic coffee thus restoring Aaraku Valley to once blanketed by lush green jungle. Besides providing jobs, the annual profit of the society is being shared among the tribal population. It also helped to develop and safe-guard the degraded, dessertified and eroded lands due to the ‚Äúcut &amp; carry‚Äù destruction of [[forests]], [[trees]], [[Wild animals|animals]] by the tribal population in ignorance. Now Aaraku Valley ranks as one of the main coffee-pepper growing areas in the south as well as the whole India &lt;ref&gt;http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/tribal-people-reap-profits-from-organic-coffee/article4364068.ece.&lt;/ref&gt; AASSAV now directly provides works, income and livelihood to more than 900 tribal people through its income generation projects. And later AASSAV invited another organization (Naandi) to tie-up with them in coffee production, processing and marketing.&lt;ref&gt;https://cdm.unfccc.int/filestorage/0/Y/I/0YICNV5TLO2QH9FA7MX4DJG6RWSUBE/2011-07-01%20Araku%20Naandi%20PDD-Final.pdf?t=SXl8bnlzY3NpfDCPb8cjrDr3xVt0331XzMWv.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Walter Clay Lowdermilk''' (July 1, 1888 ‚Äì May 6, 1974) was a [[soil conservation]]ist who worked in countries throughout the world to help protect and [[Land reclamation|reclaim lands]] in order to better feed their population. Lowdermilk worked with the [[Committee for Relief in Belgium|Belgian Relief Effort]] (B.R.E., active 1914-16 in Belgium and France) after World War I,{{dubious|Ltext says DURING the war|date=October 2016}} in China in the 1920s to help avert famine, with the [[Natural Resources Conservation Service|Soil Conservation Service]], in fascist Italy in the 1930s,  in the United States, and in [[Mandatory Palestine]] planning land and water use.

In the latter he was impressed by the advanced techniques that the [[Zionist]] settlers, and later the [[State of Israel]], took to develop water efficient [[agriculture]] and [[land use]]. A 1944 outline of local water development became known as the "Lowdermilk plan" and was of importance for the later [[National Water Carrier of Israel]].

== Education and career ==
Walter Clay Lowdermilk was named a [[Rhodes Scholarship|Rhodes Scholar]] in 1911,&lt;ref&gt;Schaeper, T, J., and K, Schaeper. Rhodes Scholars, Oxford, and the Creation of an American Elite. New York: Berghahn Books, 2007. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; attending [[Oxford]] after his undergraduate education at the [[University of Arizona]]. He married Inez Marks in August 1922.  They had two children: Winifred Esther Lowdermilk (married [[Wilmot N. Hess]]) and William Francis Lowdermilk (deceased).  Lowdermilk received his PhD from the [[University of California]] in 1929.&lt;ref name="agu.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.agu.org/inside/pastpres_bios_1941-1961.html|title=AGU - American Geophysical Union|website=AGU}}&lt;/ref&gt;
He served in World War I as an engineer and in the Belgian Relief Commission (1917 - 1918).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oac.cdlib.org/view?docId=tf6z09n8fc;developer=local;dsc.position=2501;style=oac4;view=dsc#c01-1.7.6.47|title=Register of the Commission for Relief in Belgium Records, 1914-1930|website=www.oac.cdlib.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{dubious|Lead says AFTER the war|date=October 2016}} He has been active as [[Flood control]] engineer and scientist in China and was Assistant Chief of the U.S. Soil Conservation Service, US Department of Agriculture. He served as a President of the [[American Geophysical Union]] (1941-1944).&lt;ref name="agu.org"/&gt;

== Positions and style ==
Lowdermilk's assumptions about soil conservation had a strong focus on cultural background. He was a conservationist influenced by [[George Perkins Marsh]].&lt;ref name=eq&gt;Earth Repair: A Transatlantic History of Environmental Restoration, [[Marcus Hall]] University of Virginia Press, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

His public speeches and popular books contained various allegation to religious and historical evidence and legends.&lt;ref name=eq/&gt;  Compare:

"Thou shalt inherit the holy earth as a faithful steward conserving its resources and productivity from generation to generation. Thou shalt safeguard thy fields from soil erosion, thy living waters from drying up, thy forests from desolation, and protect thy hills from overgrazing by the herds, that thy descendants may have abundance forever.  If any shall fail in this stewardship of the land, thy fruitful fields shall become sterile stony ground or wasting gullies, and thy descendants shall decrease and live in poverty or perish from off the face of the earth.

''The Eleventh Commandment'' written and broadcast over the radio by Dr. Lowdermilk in Jerusalem during June 1939 was dedicated to the Palestinian Jewish villages whose good stewardship of the earth inspired this idea."&lt;ref&gt;Lowdermilk, Walter C. Palestine, Land of Promise. New York: Greenwood, 1968.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Conquest of the Land Through Seven Thousand Years by W. C. Lowdermilk U. S. Department of Agriculture Soil Conservation Service February 1948 S.C.S. MP-32&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Palestine, Land of Promise]]'' (1944) is one of his books. One of his pamphlets, ''Conquest of the Land Through Seven Thousand Years'', was copied in the millions.&lt;ref name=eq/&gt;

He was quite positive about the Italian (fascist) land reclamation projects in the [[Pontine Marshes]] in Italy, which was, in the early stages of the [[New deal]] and before [[Italy‚ÄìUnited States relations]] degradeted, rather common for especially democratic leaning Americans.&lt;ref&gt;compare Three New Deals: Reflections on Roosevelt's America, Mussolini's Italy, and Hitler's Germany, 1933-1939. By [[Wolfgang Schivelbusch]]. Metropolitan Books, 2006. 242 pgs.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1940 he provided a rather critical review of the [[White Paper of 1939]]. He cited the dire fate of mostly Christian [[Assyrians in Iraq]] (compare [[Iraq Levies]]) after the British left the former mandate. Lowdermilk assumed, that the Jews in the then [[Mandatory Palestine|Palestine Mandate]] region 'would be massacred' similarly by Muslims, if left as a minority.&lt;ref&gt;Tracing Land Use Across Ancient Boundaries: Letters on the Use of Land in the Old World To: H.H. Bennett, Chief, Soil Conservation Service, Walter Clay Lowdermilk, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Soil Conservation Service, 1940 p.106 \&lt;/ref&gt; Lowdermilk and his wife Inez, themselves gentiles, supported the Zionist cause and Jewish settlements in Palestine. He was quite optimistic about the absorptive capacity of the region for enhanced settlements.

A water development project outlined by him became later known as the "Lowdermilk plan"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.passia.org/publications/bulletins/water-eng/pages/water08.pdf Major Early Plans on the Jordan River], [[Palestinian Academic Society for the Study of International Affairs]] website&lt;/ref&gt; The Plan was recommended by the United States in 1944 and is still of  importance for the later [[National Water Carrier of Israel]]. Parts of it, as the use of the [[Litani River]] to irrigate the [[Negev desert]] have been controversial. As early as 1946 the [[Church of Scotland]] presbytery in Jerusalem submitted a memorandum against the plan, as they feared it would spoil the sanctity of the [[Sea of Galilee]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jta.org/1946/03/21/archive/lowdermilk-plan-would-violate-sacred-places-in-palestine-inquiry-committee-told Lowdermilk Plan Would Violate Sacred Places in Palestine, Inquiry Committee Told, March 21, 1946] [[Jewish Telegraphic Agency]] website&lt;/ref&gt; The suggestion of refilling the Dead Sea through a [[Mediterranean‚ÄìDead Sea Canal]] was based on earlier approaches and is still of importance.&lt;ref&gt;Journal of Israeli History: Politics, Society, Culture   Volume 30,  Issue 1, 2011, Americans in Haifa: The Lowdermilks and the American-Israeli relationship, DOI: 10.1080/13531042.2011.553066, by Amir Man√©&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Warrior of Capestrano''''' is a tall [[limestone]] statue of a [[Picentes|Picene]] warrior, dated to around the 6th century BC. The statue stands at around 2.09 m. It was discovered accidentally in 1934 by a labourer ploughing the field in the Italian town of [[Capestrano]], along with a female statue in civilian attire, called ''Lady of Capestrano''.&lt;ref name="Basile"&gt;{{cite web | url =https://www.academia.edu/959298/The_Capestrano_Warrior_and_Related_Monuments_of_the_Seventh_to_Fifth_Centuries_B.C| title =The Capestrano Warrior and Related Monuments of the Seventh to Fifth Centuries B.C. |author=Joe Basile|website=Revue des arch√©ologues et historiens d‚Äôart de Louvain|publisher=[[Academia.edu]]|date=1993| accessdate =30 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
''The Warrior'' statue has traces of pink paint, and features a warrior wearing a hat with a huge brim, and a disk-type armor (''[[kardiophylax]]'') protecting his chest and back,&lt;ref name="Basile"/&gt; a wide belt, necklace, and armlets. Additionally, the warrior bears a short sword, knife, axe, and a defensive device known to the Greeks as ''mitra'' (a short apron covering the back).

A [[South Picene language|South Picene]] inscription incised on the pillar standing to the right of the warrior reads: "''Makupri koram ops√∫t aninis rakinev√≠i pomp[√∫ne]√≠''" ("Aninis had this statue made most excellently for Rakinewis, the Pomp[onian]").{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

Investigation subsequent to the statue's discovery revealed that the vineyard where the statue was found was situated above an [[Iron Age]] cemetery.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="28227">'''Zbynƒõk Zbyslav Str√°nsk√Ω''' (26 October 1926- 21 January 2016), was a Czech [[Museology|museologist]], considered the ‚Äúfather of scientific museology‚Äù. Between the years 1960 and 1970, he was responsible for one of the first attempts to structure a theoretical basis for museology, when directing the Department of Museology of the [[Moravsk√© zemsk√© muzeum|Moravian Museum]], in [[Brno]]. With the support of the museum director, Jan Jel√≠nek, he founded a School of museological thinking in Brno, aiming to connect museum practice to a specific theoretical system. Zbynƒõk Z. Str√°nsk√Ω, as he used to sign his texts, was the pioneer in the construction of a museology that is conceived as [[social science]], creating an autonomous system of thought based on specific concepts.

== Biography ==

Born in [[Kutn√° Hora]], the old [[Czechoslovakia]], in 26 October 1926, Zbynƒõk Z. Str√°nsk√Ω studied history and philosophy at [[Charles University]], in [[Prague]], from 1946 to 1950. During the 1950s, he worked in several Czech museums and in 1962 he was appointed the head of the innovative Department of Museology of the Moravian Museum and the J. E. Purkynƒõ University, in Brno, in which he has established, under the influence of Jan Jel√≠nek&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Jan Jel√≠nek is a Czech museologist and anthropologist, ICOM president from 1971 to 1977 and the first president of ICOFOM in 1977. He directed the Moravian Museum, in Brno.&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;nbsp;(1926-2004), the museum director, the first teaching school of museology devoted to museological theory in the world. Already in the 1960s and 1970s, Str√°nsk√Ω was considered the leading person of the Central-European museological school.

=== Role in the international community ===
Between 1980 and 1990, Str√°nsk√Ω was an active participant of the [[International Committee for Museology]] ‚Äì ICOFOM, of the [[International Council of Museums]] ‚Äì ICOM, being in charge, from 1985, of the terminological project that aimed to create a Treaty of Museology and a ''Dictionarium Museologicum''.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Publication of a dictionary with the translation for twenty different languages of essential museological terms. See Dictionarium Museologicum. Budapest National Center of Museums, 1983.&lt;/ref&gt; Until the beginning of the 1990s, ICOFOM has expressed its mission to ‚Äúestablish museology as a scientific discipline‚Äù.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;ICOFOM ‚Äì International Committee for Museology, Museological News, Semi-Annual Bulletin of the International Committee of ICOM for Museology, n. 15, June, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; Str√°nsk√Ω has continually influenced this committee and participated in several of its meetings, becoming an elected member of its executive board in 1986.

=== The training in museology and the "Brno school" ===
Throughout his whole career, Zbynƒõk Z. Str√°nsk√Ω worked to establish a complete and coherent training in museology,&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Str√°nsk√Ω was not the only one to develop a course in museology in the second half of the 20th century. We may recall the examples of the courses created by Raymond Singleton and later by Geoffrey Lewis, in Leicester, or the course created by Georges Henri Rivi√®re, in France, in 1970, or even the programs of Toron, in Poland, the one in Zagreb, Yugoslavia (now in Croatia) or the one from the American Association of Museums in the United States.&lt;/ref&gt; aiming to secure a place for museologists as thinkers and researchers. In 1962, a few professionals from the Moravian Museum created the Department of Museology, institutionally connected both to the museum and to J. E. Purkynƒõ University, establishing a line of museological training that was going to be characterized as the ‚ÄúBrno School‚Äù.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;Cer√°volo, Suely Moraes. Da palavra ao termo: um caminho para compreender a museologia. 2004. 218 f. Tese (Doutorado em Biblioteconomia e Documenta√ß√£o) ‚Äì Escola de Comunica√ß√£o e Artes, Universidade de S√£o Paulo, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; The craved transformation envisaged ‚Äúmaking a real profession of museum work‚Äù.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;Jel√≠nek, Jan, in Str√°nsk√Ω, Zbynƒõk Z., ‚ÄúBrno: Education in Museology‚Äù, Museological Papers V, Supplementum 2, Brno: J. E. Purkynƒõ University and Moravian Museum, 1974, p.10.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 20 June 1968, the students of the first class of museology received their university diplomas in Brno.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;Str√°nsk√Ω, Zbynƒõk Z., ‚ÄúThe first museology graduates in Brno‚Äù, ICOM ‚Äì International Council of Museums, ICOM News / Nouvelles de l‚ÄôICOM, vol. 22, n. 2, June 1969, pp.61-62.&lt;/ref&gt; As reported by Str√°nsk√Ω, most of them were museum directors or professionals who already had a degree in another disciplinary field. The museology course had the duration of two years, with four sessions composed of one hundred lessons each, including theoretical courses and practical lessons. The themes of the classes were divided between general museology and special museology.

In the year of 1986, his training program in museology, in Brno, would gain an increasing number of new followers from every part of the world, with the creation of his International Summer School of Museology ‚Äì ISSOM. Inside the structure of the so-called [[Masaryk University]]&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;The Masaryk University was founded in Brno in 1919 and it is currently the second largest university in the Czech Republic. In 1960, the university was renamed Jan Evangelista Purkynƒõ University, taking the name of the Czech biologist. In 1990, following the Velvet Revolution it regained its original name.&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;nbsp;and with the support of [[UNESCO]], the ISSOM lasted until the year 1999, disseminating the theoretical knowledge of Museology. In 1998, Str√°nsk√Ω leaves the city of Brno to live in [[Bansk√° Bystrica]], a city of [[Slovakia]], where he has created the Department of Ecomuseology, which he would coordinate.

Str√°nsk√Ω continued to teach Museology at the [[Matej Bel University|University of Matej Bel]], in Bansk√° Bystrica, until the year 2002. In the following years, he returned to Brno as an invited lecturer. Str√°nsk√Ω continued to publish texts on the Theory of Museology, trying to reaffirm and adapt his structured system for this science until the first decade of this century. He passed away in Bansk√° Bystrica, on the 21 January 2016.

== Points of view on Museology ==

Museology, a term that acquired different connotations throughout the 20th century and even before,&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;On the history of the term until the 20th century, see Aquilina, 2011; and Desvall√©es &amp; Mairesse, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; thanks to the attempt to obtain academic legitimacy by some Czech museum professionals, it would gain a new dimension, from the 1960s, either as a science or as an autonomous disciplinary field, providing the necessary bases for museum work.

In his structural theory, Str√°nsk√Ω was committed to the investigation of essential points considered by him as indispensable for the constitution of a scientific discipline:

# first, a science must have defined a specific subject of study;
# then, a science must use its own set of methods;
# a science must have a specific terminology, a language;
# and, at last, it must be based on a theoretical system.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;Str√°nsk√Ω, Zbynƒõk Z., ‚ÄúMuseology as a Science (a Thesis)‚Äù, Museologia, n.15, XI, 1980, pp. 33-39.&lt;/ref&gt;

The search for scientific legitimation, thus, should be followed by the concomitant construction of a theoretical system of museology accordingly to the framework of contemporary sciences.

=== Metamuseology ===
In the context of the 1960s, Str√°nsk√Ω has appointed that there were objective reasons for the ‚Äúbirth of museology as a science‚Äù,&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;Idem, p.26.&lt;/ref&gt; however, its internal prerequisite, i.e., the logical structure, was inexistent. His question on the character of museology, then, made him think on the theoretical base of the very theory.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;Stransk√Ω, Zbynƒõk Z., ‚ÄúPredmet muzeologie‚Äù, in Stransk√Ω, Zbynƒõk Z., (ed.), Sborn√≠k materi√°lu prv√©ho muzeologick√©ho symposia, Brno: Moravian Museum, 1965, p.31.&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, Str√°nsk√Ω has built a metatheoretical problematic as the starting point for structuring the scientific discipline, introducing the notion of metamuseology.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;Stransk√Ω, Zbynƒõk Z., Introduction √† l‚Äô√©tude de la mus√©ologie, Destin√©e aux √©tudiants de l‚Äô√âcole Internationale d‚Äô√ât√© de Mus√©ologie ‚Äì EIEM, Brno : Universit√© Masaryk, 1995, p.15.&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;nbsp;The term designates ‚Äúthe theory whose subject is museology in itself‚Äù, in a certain way being strictly bound to museology, but also related to philosophy, to history and to the theory of science and culture.

In his metamuseological approach, the first problem raised concerned museology's subject of study. Str√°nsk√Ω proposed some disconcerting questions for the field under development. With his initial declaration, in which he denies the museum as the scientific subject,&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;Stransk√Ω, Zbynƒõk Z., ‚ÄúPredmet muzeologie‚Äù, in Stransk√Ω, Zbynƒõk Z., (ed.), Sborn√≠k materi√°lu prv√©ho muzeologick√©ho symposia, Brno: Moravian Museum, 1965, pp. 30-33.&lt;/ref&gt; the author opens the way towards a long process of self-reflection that marked museology in its bases in Eastern Europe.

By stating that the ‚Äúsubject of museology is not and cannot be the museum‚Äù,&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;Stransk√Ω, Zbynƒõk Z., ‚ÄúPredmet muzeologie‚Äù, in Stransk√Ω, Zbynƒõk Z., (ed.), Sborn√≠k materi√°lu prv√©ho muzeologick√©ho symposia, Brno: Moravian Museum, 1965, p.33.&lt;/ref&gt; Str√°nsk√Ω intended to separate the ‚Äúinstrument‚Äù ‚Äì or the means, i.e., the museum ‚Äì and the ‚Äúend‚Äù to which it serves. He alleges, in effect, what could have been considered obvious in the context of post-war museums, which is the fact that the museum, as an institution that serves to a certain end, could not be the study subject of a science. Nevertheless, and in a tautological approach, according to some of his critics,&lt;ref name=":16"&gt;See Desvall√©es, Andr√© &amp; Mairesse, Fran√ßois, Dictionnaire encyclop√©dique de mus√©ologie, Paris : Armand Colin, 2011. 722p.&lt;/ref&gt; he would propose that museology's subject of study should be searched in the very museum work, in the ‚Äúsystematic and critical‚Äù task of producing the museum object or ''musealia'', in Stranskian terminology.

===Museality===

This thinker was, then, responsible for the dislocation of museology's subject from the museum, as a historic institution, to museality ‚Äì understood as a ‚Äúspecific documentary value‚Äù.&lt;ref name=":17"&gt;Str√°nsk√Ω, Zbynƒõk Z., ‚ÄúBrno: Education in Museology‚Äù, Museological Papers V, Supplementum 2, Brno: J. E. Purkynƒõ University and Moravian Museum, 1974, p.28.&lt;/ref&gt; This last concept, central to his theory, would lead Str√°nsk√Ω to conceive the cognitive intention of museology as the scientific interpretation of an ‚Äúattitude of man to reality‚Äù. In his opinion, this seizing of the museum character of things, which he called ‚Äúmuseality‚Äù, must be ‚Äúin the center of the gnoseological intention of museology‚Äù&lt;ref name=":18"&gt;Str√°nsk√Ω, Zbynƒõk Z., ‚ÄúMuseology and Museums‚Äù, ICOFOM Study Series ‚Äì ISS, n. 12, Stockholm, ICOM International Committee for Museology, 1987, p.289.&lt;/ref&gt; as this discipline's scientific task, delimiting its position within the system of sciences.

Hence, the concept of museality (''‚Äúmuzealita‚Äù''), understood as the ‚Äúquality‚Äù or ‚Äúvalue‚Äù of musealia, appeared in Str√°nsk√Ω's works in 1970,&lt;ref name=":19"&gt;Str√°nsk√Ω, Zbynƒõk Z., ‚ÄúM√∫zejnictvo v rel√°cii te√≥rie a praxe‚Äù, M√∫zeum, 1970, roƒç. XV, ƒç. 3, pp. 173-183.&lt;/ref&gt; being proposed as museology's true subject of study. The first attempts to define the term, however, have presented logical problems.

The museologist from the ancient [[German Democratic Republic]], Klaus Schreiner, for instance, hasn‚Äôt conceived museality as the property of an object as such but as something that is attributed to the object only in the context of a particular, specialized discipline. According to Schreiner, there cannot be a value ‚Äúin itself‚Äù and the concept of museality in the Stranskian sense is the product of a ‚Äúbourgeois-imperialist axiology‚Äù. He considers that the philosophical value propagated is ‚Äútimeless, classness and generally not human‚Äù and that, as such, it ‚Äúabsolutizes the bourgeois class interests‚Äù.&lt;ref name=":20"&gt;Schreiner, Klaus, ‚ÄúForschungsgegenstand der Museologie und Disziplingenese‚Äù, Neue Museumskunde, vol. 23, n. 1, 1987, pp.4-8, passim.&lt;/ref&gt; As noted by [[Peter van Mensch|Peter Van Mensch]], Str√°nsk√Ω would modify the concept of museality over the years, changing its sense from a value category to the ‚Äúspecific value orientation‚Äù itself.&lt;ref name=":21"&gt;van Mensch, Peter, Towards a Methodology of Museology, PhD Thesis. University of Z√°greb, Z√°greb, 1992. Available at: &lt;http://:www.muuseum.ee/en/erialane_areng/museoloogiaalane_ki /p_van_mensch_towar/mensch04&gt;. Access in: 27 July 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Influences ==
There can be appointed several influences to the work of Zbynƒõk Z. Str√°nsk√Ω. However, not all of them can be attested with direct citation in his texts. Some authors will suppose, for instance, that the knowledge of studies by the Belgian [[Paul Otlet]] on [[Bibliology]] would have influenced Stranskian thinking on scientific museology. In his theoretical texts, it is possible to note, among the most quoted authors, the Czechs [[Ji≈ô√≠ V. Neustupn√Ω|Ji≈ôi Neustupn√Ω]] and [[Josef Bene≈°]], as well as the Russian Awraam M. Razgon.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, Stransk√Ω, Zbynƒõk Z., Introduction √† l‚Äô√©tude de la mus√©ologie, Destin√©e aux √©tudiants de l‚Äô√âcole Internationale d‚Äô√ât√© de Mus√©ologie ‚Äì EIEM, Brno : Universit√© Masaryk, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; It must be acknowledged, still, the fundamental support of the Czechs Jan Jel√≠nek and [[Vino≈° Sofka]] who have contributed to the dialogues established between Str√°nsk√Ω and the international context of museology through his insertion in ICOFOM and the creation of ISSOM.

== Influenced authors ==
The referencial thinking of Str√°nsk√Ω for Central and Eastern Europe would be cited in publications mainly since the 1970s, by authors such as the Russian [[A. M.

In the years 1990, several museology authors, from the connection with Str√°nsk√Ω and his works in ICOFOM and ISSOM, would take his own interpretations from the reflections he initiated assimilating their own ideas to the thinking in their respective countries; this would be the case, for instance, of Bernard Deloche,&lt;ref&gt;Deloche, Bernard.&amp;nbsp;''Le mus√©e virtuel''. Vers une √©thique des nouvelles images. Questions actuelles. Paris: Presses universitaires de France, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; in France, and Tereza Scheiner,&lt;ref&gt;Scheiner, Tereza Cristina M. Apolo e Dion√≠sio no templo das musas ‚Äì Museu: g√™nese, id√©ia e representa√ß√µes na cultura ocidental. Rio de Janeiro: Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro/ECO. 1998.&amp;nbsp; 
&lt;/ref&gt; in Brazil.

In general, even if some Anglo-Saxon museologists try to reduce the discipline to a set of techniques, those from the countries located in the ancient Eastern Europe, such as Anna Gregorov√° and Klaus Schreiner, define it as a science under construction. In effect, the first critics to this conception are [[Kenneth Hudson]] (UK) and [[George E. Burcaw]] (United States), so that the more theoretical approach to museology, from Str√°nsk√Ω, was followed by authors in countries with a bigger tendency to theorization: the German and Latin schools, as well as Latin America.

Authors such as the Dutch Peter van Mensch proposed to structure the discipline based on the model initiated by Str√°nsk√Ω. He understood museology according to five aspects: general museology, theoretical museology (or matamuseology, for Str√°nsk√Ω), special museology, historic museology and applied museology.&lt;ref&gt;van Mensch, Peter, ''Towards a Methodology of Museology'', PhD thesis. University of Z√°greb, Z√°greb, 1992. Available at: &lt;&lt;nowiki&gt;http://:www.muuseum.ee/en/erialane_areng/museoloogiaalane_ki&lt;/nowiki&gt; /p_van_mensch_towar/mensch04&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;  To these five aspects Str√°nsk√Ω would propose to include social museology, to study the phenomenon of musealization in current societies. Furthermore, Peter van Mensch would amplify his reflection on the professionalization of museology. He proposes the PRC model (Preservation, Research and Communication), based on the recognition of the discipline as a true science.&lt;ref&gt;The PRC model is close to the model established by Str√°nsk√Ω and also adopted by Georges Henri Rivi√®re, of selection, thesaurization and presentation. This is a trinomial model that founded the pillars of museum activity. These activities are dependent one of the other but in a non-hierarchical way. Desvall√©es &amp; Mairesse, p. 363-364.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The influence in ICOFOM LAM ===
According to the de spirit of the Declaration of Santiago of Chile (1972), and with the goal to decentralize the action of the International Committee for Museology, it is created in 1986, the Regional Subcommittee of ICOFOM for Latin America and the Caribbean ‚Äì ICOFOM LAM, conceived by [[Nelly Decarolis]] (Argentina) and [[Tereza Scheiner]] (Brazil). The scientific profile of the field and the theoretical reflections would be reaffirmed, considered as central matters for the Region. However, Tereza Scheiner and [[Luciana Menezes de Carvalho]] (Brazil) pointed out that, differentiating itself from Str√°nsk√Ω, ‚Äúmuseology has the character of a theory, but not of a science‚Äù.&lt;ref&gt;Scheiner, Tereza &amp; Carvalho, Luciana M. Constituci√≥n y consolidaci√≥n de la museologia como campo disciplinario. ICOFOM Study Series, n. 43a, 2015, p. 183. Dispon√≠vel em: &lt;nowiki&gt;http://network.icom.museum/icofom/publications/our-publications/&lt;/nowiki&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/ref&gt;

Particularly in the context of Brazil, the theoretical perspective developed by Str√°nsk√Ω was introduced in the country in the 1980s, mainly in the works of Waldisa R√∫ssio (in S√£o Paulo) and Tereza Scheiner (in Rio de Janeiro), both responsible for the creation of ‚Äúschools‚Äù based on this author's thinking and marked by the configuration of museology as a science.&lt;ref&gt;Regarding this influence in the context of museology teaching in Rio de Janeiro, see {{cite journal|doi=10.1111/muse.12094 | volume=68 | title=UNIRIO: A Model of Evolving Museology Teaching in Brazil | journal=Museum International | pages=29‚Äì42 | last1 = Brulon Soares | first1 = Bruno}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Recognition by the field ===
In 1993, with the work ‚ÄúDe museologica‚Äù (manuscript), Str√°nsk√Ω received the title of Associated Professor (in the Czech language, Docent).

In 1996, getting the title of regular professor, he rejected it with the justification that museology is not an official credential Science.

In 2006, Str√°nsk√Ω was given the Silver medal of Masaryk University from the hands of the rector [[Petr Fiala]].

In Brazil, with the support of ICOFOM, an homage for Str√°nsk√Ω was organized by the [[Federal University of the State of Rio de Janeiro|Universidade Federal do Estado do Rio de Janeiro]] ‚Äì UNIRIO, in the III Debates Cicle of the Museology School, organized in October, 2015, in celebration of the 50th anniversary of Str√°nsk√Ω's declaration on museology's study subject, in 1965.

In 2015, the Regional Subcommittee of ICOFOM to Latin America and the Caribbean ‚Äì ICOFOM LAM has dedicated the year for the work of Str√°nsk√Ω and his influence in the Region, in the occasion of the XXIII Annual Meeting of ICOFOM LAM, in [[Panama City]].

After his death, in 2016, the Czech journal Museologica Brunensia is organizing a special issue dedicated to Zbynƒõk Z. Str√°nsk√Ω.
