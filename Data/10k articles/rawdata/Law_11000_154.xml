A '''constitutional referendum''' was held in the [[Central African Republic]] on 5 December 2004. The new constitution would change the system of government from [[Presidential system|presidential]] to [[semi-presidential system|semi-presidential]], as well as putting a limit of two terms on the President.&lt;ref&gt;[http://africanelections.tripod.com/cf.html Elections in the Central African Republic] African Elections Database&lt;/ref&gt; It was approved by 91.37% of voters with a 77.1% turnout.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1093">'''[[Greece]]''', as a civil law country has [[administrative court]]s. The establishment of those courts can be found in article 94 of the [[Constitution of the Hellenic Republic]] 1975, as revised in 2001. The '''administrative courts''' are composed from districts Courts of First Instance, district [[Courts of Appeal]] and a [[Council of State (Greece)|Supreme Administrative Court]] that is called the '''"[[Council of State (Greece)|Council of State]]"'''. The Council of State is also the Court of first and last instance in some important cases. The Greek administrative courts have jurisdiction upon litigations between the State and the civilians. The most important of them are tax cases, social security cases, tort liability of the State cases, illegal immigration cases etc.

In [[public administration]], '''administrative discretion''' refers to the flexible exercising of judgment and decision making allowed to public administrators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=Administrative Discretion |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of public administration and public policy |year=2003 |page=35 |publisher=Dekker |location=New York |last=Rabin |first=J.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Cann&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cann|first1=Steven|title=The Administrative State, the Exercise of Discretion, and the Constitution|journal=Public Administration Review|date=July 2007|volume=67|issue=4|pages=780–782|doi=10.1111/j.1540-6210.2007.00760.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regulatory agencies have the power to exercise this type of discretion in their day-to-day activities, and there have been cases where regulatory agencies have abused this power. Administrative law can help these agencies get on the path of following regulations, serve the public, and in turn, a reflection of the public's values and beliefs.

There's a need for administrative discretion because the public’s interest could be at risk if several agencies were not following laws and regulations. Administrative discretion is important because without it, it could lead to arbitrary and unreasonable use of such discretion, which may lead to destruction of basic principles of administrative law.&lt;ref name=Vaishnav&gt;{{cite journal |last=Vaishnav |first=S. |last2=Marwaha |first2=K. |year=2015|title=Judiciary: A Ladder between Inevitable Administrative Discretion and Good Governance |journal=International Journal of Multidisciplinary Approach &amp; Studies |volume=2 |issue=2 |pages=63–72}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although this type of discretion isn't laid out in the job-description of a bureaucrat/public servant, it is necessary because citizens use these bureaucratic institutions every day; such as the D.M.V. , public schooling, and numerous others. [[street-level bureaucracy|Street-level bureaucrats]] have to deal with the provision of service as well as translating vaguely worded mandates into specific cohesive and comprehensive language to organize protocol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sowa|first1=Jessica E.|last2=Selden|first2=Sally Coleman|title=Administrative Discretion and Active Representation: An Expansion of the Theory of Representative Bureaucracy|journal=Public Administration Review|date=November 2003|volume=63|issue=6|pages=700–710|doi=10.1111/1540-6210.00333}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Administrative discretion allows agencies to use professional expertise and judgment when making decisions or performing official duties, as opposed to only adhering to strict regulations or statuses. For example, a public official has administrative discretion when he or she has the freedom to make a choice among potential courses of action. The failure to exercise reasonable judgment or discretion is abuse of discretion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=Administrative Discretion |encyclopedia=West's Encyclopedia of American Law |year=2005 |accessdate=21 April 2015 |url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G2-3437700153.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"I think that in our system of government, where law ends, tyranny need not begin. Where law ends, discretion begins, and the exercise of discretion may mean either beneficence or tyranny, either justice or injustice, either reasonableness or arbitrariness."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Discretionary Justice: A preliminary inquiry |last = Davis|first = Kenneth C.|publisher = LSU Press|year = 1969|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;—Kenneth Culp Davis

==History==

The idea of administrative discretion dates back as far as the time of widely known Greek philosopher [[Socrates]] in his quest to lay the foundation for philosophical ethics. Socrates determined a general ranking of "universal morals" in order to piece together certain criterion that could test what course of action to take in any immediate situation. He assigned value orders as well as certain "means to ends" that would determine alternatives for ethical philosophical generalization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Leys|first1=Wayne A. R.|title=Ethics and Administrative Discretion|journal=Public Administration Review|date=Winter 1943 |volume=3|issue=1|pages=10|doi=10.2307/973098|jstor=973098}}&lt;/ref&gt; In doing so, Socrates was creating the first type of basis for administrative discretion. 
[[File:Andrew Jackson 1873 Issue-2c.jpg|thumb|Andrew Jackson 1873 Postage Stamp—US Postal Service]]
When [[Andrew Jackson]] took office in 1829, the country was going through radical changes—the scale of government grew extensively which caused the need for an increase in the administrative activity. Jackson brought the bureaucratization of administration.&lt;ref name=Mashaw&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mashaw|first1=Jerry L.|title=Administration and "The Democracy": Administrative Law from Jackson to Lincoln, 1829-1861|journal=The Yale Law Journal|date=1 June 2008|volume=117|issue=8|pages=1568|doi=10.2307/20454693|jstor=20454693}}&lt;/ref&gt; He appointed his close friends to office to work in administered processes. This was known as the "spoils system", in which was a system was in place where presidential administrations had the power of hiring or firing federal workers; this brought a constant change in demands and routines for personnel. Of his additions to the administrative discretion and of bureaucracy as we know it today, one in particular, the creation of [[History of United States patent law#Patent Act of 1836|The Patent Reform Act of 1836]] brought about the creation of new offices and adjudicatory administrative boards.  Although, perhaps unknowingly, Jackson brought a new age to administrative discretion. Another president who has come in contact with administrative discretion is Madison. Known as Madison's Managers, drafted in 1787, some argue that early public administration literature had it right.&lt;ref name=Cann/&gt;

After Jackson, many presidents followed suit of his example—appointing members to administrative processes. In some cases, officials appointed by the presidents abused their powers in administration. There were attempts to control administrative discretion throughout the 19th century, but those attempts overall, failed. Political appointees believed they indeed were law themselves—Jesse Hoyt and his successor Samuel Swartwout for example, notoriously did not comply with the rule to return funds they had collected on behalf of the Federal Government.&lt;ref name=Mashaw/&gt; However, within the 20th century, substantial changes occurred that better formed the concept of administrative discretion as we know it today.

[[Franklin Roosevelt]]’s New Deal brought much needed relief to the public by implementing welfare programs in a dire time of crisis. There was a type of bureaucratic "sprawl": this era saw the creation of numerous agencies and boards. The birth of such a large bureaucracy, not only helped in aiding the public, but Roosevelt’s programs also answered important question of who would be part of the bureaucracy and govern future welfare programs. The New Deal emphasized the importance of administrative discretion in government and their processes by expanding the staff of the White House and creating new managerial techniques for the executive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Morone |first=J. A. |year=1998 |title=The Democratic Wish: Popular participation and the limits of American government |publisher=Yale University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Administrative Procedure Act (United States)|The Administrative Procedure Act of 1946]] was created to govern the internal procedures of administrative agencies and how those agencies interact with the public. The act came about after the Attorney General appointed a committee to investigate the need for procedural reform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Marble |first=R. D. |year=1948 |title=Federal Administrative Procedure Act of 1946 |journal=Mississippi Law Journal |volume=20 |page=62}}&lt;/ref&gt; The notion of the time (not too far off-base of popular public notion today) was that various agencies were created by Congress over a long period of time in a piece-mail, haphazard manner. The view was that there was no uniformity in the chaotic bodies to administer anything. The 1946 act places policies on agencies’ rule-making, adjudications, and licensing behavior. The intention was to make sure that the public is protected and safe, with secured proper entitlements.

==Examples of administrative discretion in law==
[[File:Compiègne Justice.jpg|thumb|Compiègne Justice]]
''[[Goldberg v. Kelly]]''—In this 1970 case, City officials were administrating and terminating public assistance benefits under the federally assisted program of Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) and/or under New York State’s Home Relief Program in New York City. The problem arose as residents receiving financial aid claimed that the New York City officials overseeing and administering these programs terminated their aid without notifying them or holding a hearing. Recipients alleged that this was unconstitutional on the Administration's part because it denying them due process of law guaranteed under the Due Process Clause in the Fourteenth Amendment (Case Briefs). In this case, Administrative Discretion resulted in individualized parameters of what was deemed necessary to convey a termination of aid, instead of a federal standard. The Holding of Chief Justice Warren Burger and the court sided with the appellants' view: a full hearing of evidence is required before a recipient can be denied/deprived of certain types of government benefits. In other words, a recipient must receive some sort of notice should their aid be changed/terminated; whether in writing or orally.

''[[Industrial Union Department v. American Petroleum Institute|Industrial Union Department v. American Petroleum Institute-]]-''In this 1980, [[Occupational Safety and Health Act (United States)|Under the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970]] (or OSHA), The Secretary of Labor was required to explicitly state exposure risks/limits at the lowest level of carcinogens that won't impair viability of the industries regulated. However, this failed to happen. The Secretary did not say or record anywhere that exposure to the substance benzene at 10 ppm (parts per million) would cause leukemia and exposure to 1 ppm would not (Oyez cases). The holding of the Supreme Court, under Justice Warren Burger, concluded that there was a statute for a requirement of significant risk, and the Secretary and agency had failed to uphold the statue of workers' health at risks.&lt;ref name=Shapiro&gt;{{cite journal |last=Shapiro |first=M. |title=Administrative Discretion: The Next Stage |journal=Yale Law Journal |volume=92 |page=1487 |year=1982 |url=https://scholarship.law.berkeley.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2706&amp;context=facpubs}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this case, Administrative Discretion under the Secretary of Labor had not understood the "extent feasible" .

''[[Citizens to Preserve Overton Park v. Volpe|Citizens To Preserve Overton Park, Inc. v Volpe]]--''In this 1971 case, in Memphis, Tennessee, a group of citizens claimed that The Secretary of Transportation made the decision to have construction of a highway where Overton Park was located and violated statutes enacted by the congress.&lt;ref name=Shapiro/&gt; The court holding under justice Burger upheld the "feasible and prudent" clause: wherein an alternative exists to circumvent building the proposed highway through the park. Furthermore, the Secretary's decision to use federal money for the highway did not comply with the Department of Transportation Act of 1966.

''[[IRS targeting controversy|The IRS Tea Party Controversy]]'': The IRS must exercise discretion in administering the tax law. The IRS oversees a vast system that affects nearly everyone. Since the law is complex and often difficult to interpret, the IRS must draw fine lines in order to properly interpret, apply, and enforce the law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kahng |first=L.|year=2013 |title=The IRS Teas Party Controversy and Administrative Discretion |journal= Cornell Law Review Online |url=http://cornelllawreview.org/files/2013/09/99CLRO411.pdf  |volume=99 |pages=41–55}}&lt;/ref&gt; The IRS claims it gave extra scrutiny to Tea Party-affiliated groups based solely on the name and goals of the groups. The IRS asked those groups invasive questions that were not normally asked of other groups: about their donor lists, affiliations and contacts with the media .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Korte |first=G. |date=13 May 2013 |title=Q&amp;A: The IRS-Tea Party scandal explained |accessdate=2015-04-13 |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2013/05/13/irs-tea-party-scandal-explained/2156009/ |work=USA Today}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Administrative Discretion in Criminal Law Enforcement''--'' When a government official of law enforcement uses their own sense of ethical discretion such as not to or to invoke in criminal process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Goldstein|first1=Judith|title=International law and domestic institutions: reconciling North American "unfair" trade laws|journal=International Organization|date=22 May 2009|volume=50|issue=4|pages=541|doi=10.1017/s0020818300033506}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are two major situational motivations of police discretion; whether police response is internally invoked or citizen initiated and whether it is a law enforcement of order maintenance situation. The two situational motivations combine to create four types of discretionary situations for law enforcement officials. The four different situations are proactive and reactive law enforcement and proactive and reactive order maintenance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Reiss|first1=Albert J.|title=Consequences of Compliance and Deterrence Models of Law Enforcement for the Exercise of Police Discretion|journal=Law and Contemporary Problems|date=Autumn 1984|volume=47|issue=4|pages=83|doi=10.2307/1191688|jstor=1191688|url=https://scholarship.law.duke.edu/lcp/vol47/iss4/5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern day administrative discretion==
{{OR section|date=May 2015}}
In today’s administrative discretion, some issues affect the way organizations function and the way the public feels towards administrations/agencies as a whole. In this way public administrators are seen as "moral agents"; they are given the task to exercise discretion, and reflect the society’s values.  In theory, the public expects administrators to be the exemplary role models of society and follow laws and regulations. [[File:Shimer College dialogue transparency 2010.jpg|thumb|Shimer College dialogue transparency 2010
"We want dialogue and transparency."
]]In reality, some do not think the administrators play fair and the public feels distrusts towards them. In a poll done by Gallup.com, the public showed an increase in the mistrust in government. People were asked if corruption was widespread throughout the government. The results recorded from 2006 to 2013 rose significantly; from 56% to 79%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Clifton|first1=Jon|title=Americans Less Satisfied With Freedom|url=http://news.gallup.com/poll/172019/americans-less-satisfied-freedom.aspx|publisher=Gallup|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt; The public may know little to nothing about the administration or their responsibilities, yet approval is very low. Some{{who|date=May 2015}} attribute this mistrust to a lack of transparency, where corruption can occur.&lt;ref name=Vaishnav/&gt; The lack of transparency can mean that an administration is not completely honest, secretly keeping hidden agendas: withholding information from public view. It can also simply mean that the administration does not attempt to make their information easy to access or understand for the public.

The '''Aliens Act 1905''' was an [[Act of Parliament|Act]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] of the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]].&lt;ref name="MH"&gt;Moving Here&lt;/ref&gt; The Act for the first time introduced [[immigration]] controls and registration, and gave the [[Home Secretary]] overall responsibility for immigration and nationality matters.&lt;ref name="MH"/&gt;

While the Act was ostensibly designed to prevent [[pauper]]s or [[criminal]]s from entering the country and set up a mechanism to deport those who slipped through, one of its main objectives was to control [[Jew]]ish immigration from Eastern Europe.&lt;ref name="C4"&gt;Channel 4&lt;/ref&gt; Jewish immigration from Eastern Europe saw a significant increase after 1880&lt;ref&gt;Bernard Gainer, The Alien Invasion: The Origins of the Aliens Act of 1905, (London, Heinemann Educational books LTD, 1972) Preface.&lt;/ref&gt; which served as some basis for the creation of the Aliens Act 1905. Although it remained in force, the 1905 Act was effectively subsumed by the Aliens Restriction Act 1914, which introduced far more restrictive provisions. It was eventually repealed by the [[Aliens Restriction (Amendment) Act 1919]].

In the 19th century, the [[Russian Empire]] was home to about five million [[Jews]], at the time, the "largest Jewish community in the world".&lt;ref name="C4"&gt;Channel 4&lt;/ref&gt; Subjected to religious persecution, they were obliged to live in the [[Pale of Settlement]], on the Polish-Russian borders, in conditions of great [[poverty]].&lt;ref name="C4"/&gt; About half left, mostly for the [[United States]], but many – about 150,000 – arrived in the United Kingdom mostly in England.&lt;ref name="C4"/&gt; This reached its peak in the late 1890s, with "tens of thousands of Jews&amp;nbsp;... mostly poor, semi-skilled and unskilled" settling in the [[East End of London]].&lt;ref name="C4"/&gt;

By the turn of the century, a popular and media backlash had begun.&lt;ref name="C4"/&gt; The [[British Brothers League]] was formed, with the support of prominent politicians, organising marches and petitions.&lt;ref name="C4"/&gt; At rallies, its speakers said that Britain should not become "the dumping ground for the scum of Europe".&lt;ref name="C4"/&gt; In 1905, an editorial in the ''[[Manchester Evening Chronicle]]''&lt;ref&gt;Quoted by Channel 4: Immigration&lt;/ref&gt; wrote "that the dirty, destitute, diseased, verminous and criminal foreigner who dumps himself on our soil and rates simultaneously, shall be forbidden to land". Anti-semitism broke out into violence in South Wales in 1902 and 1903 where Jews were assaulted.&lt;ref&gt;David Cesarani, ''The Jewish Chronicle and Anglo-Jewry 1841-1991'', (Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, 1994) p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt;

Aside from anti-semitic sentiments, the act was also driven by the economic and social unrest in the East End of London where most immigrants settled. Work was difficult to come by and families required all members to contribute.&lt;ref&gt;Bernard Gainer, ''The Alien Invasion: The Origins of the Aliens Act of 1905'', (London, Heinemann Educational books LTD, 1972) pp. 19-20.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Banco Convention of 1905''', between the United States and Mexico, was negotiated and signed in 1905&lt;ref name="C1905"/&gt; and ratified by both nations in 1907.  It resulted in 247 exchanges of [[bancos]] (land surrounded by bends in the river that became segregated by a cutoff, often due to rapid erosion of the river channel) between the two nations over the period from 1910 to 1976.&lt;ref name="ibwc"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibwc.state.gov/Treaties_Minutes/treaties.html |title=Treaties between the U.S. and Mexico |publisher=International Boundary and Water Commission |accessdate=2015-06-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150601081248/http://www.ibwc.state.gov/Treaties_Minutes/treaties.html |archivedate=2015-06-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Most of these were in the [[Lower Rio Grande Valley]], the [[Presidio Valley]] and the El Paso-Juarez Valley.  In 1927 the convention was applied to the short international border on the Colorado River.&lt;ref name="DOI"/&gt;

==Background==
[[File:Kanuti River October 2011.jpg|thumb|300px|An example of a banco, created when a meander is cut off by a new, shorter channel, leaving a cut-off section of land surrounded by a U-shaped (oxbow) lake.]]
[[File:Los Indios Banco -98 81959 W 26 36393 N.jpg|thumb|300px|Aerial photo of Ringgold Banco, opposite Rio Grande City, Texas; exchanged from the United States to Mexico on September 26, 1949.]]
In 1884, a further treaty set out to clarify the 1848 [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]].  The [[Convention between the United States of America and the United States of Mexico touching the international boundary line where it follows the bed of the Rio Colorado|Convention of November 12, 1884]] established the rules for determining the location of the US-Mexico boundary when the meandering rivers of the international border transferred tracts of land from one bank of the river to the other.&lt;ref name="Lee"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ibwc.state.gov/Files/TREATY_OF_1884.pdf|title=Convention Between the United States of America and the United States of Mexico, Touching the International Boundary Line where it follows the Bed of the Rio Colorado |date=November 12, 1884|accessdate=2015-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The treaty stated that if the river changed course gradually through a process of [[soil erosion]], then the boundary should follow the new course of the river.  However, a sudden change of course, for example one caused by a flood, would not affect the boundary. Nevertheless, the clarifications established in the treaty of 1884 did not resolve the question of land ownership.&lt;ref name="Lee"/&gt;

The [[Convention to avoid the difficulties occasioned by reason of the changes which take place in the beds of the Rio Grande and Colorado River|Convention of March 1, 1889]] established the [[International Boundary and Water Commission|International Boundary Commission]] (IBC) to apply the rules in the 1884 Convention.&lt;ref name="ibwc"/&gt;  It was modified by the Banco Convention of March 20, 1905 to retain the courses of the Rio Grande and the Colorado River as international boundaries in the event of sudden changes.&lt;ref name="ibwc"/&gt;

Because the course of the Rio Grande was not static, to maintain the location of the river as the international boundary presented diplomatic and practical challenges.  The river changed course frequently where it flowed through areas of relatively loose [[alluvial soil]], doubling back on itself as it wound its way through the Lower Rio Grande Valley.  Especially in times of flooding, tracts of land called "bancos" were created by [[Avulsion (legal term)|avulsive changes]] that cut off entire oxbow-shaped meanders.

The result of these cut-offs was often confusion regarding sovereignty, land ownership, and law enforcement.&lt;ref name="Lee"&gt;{{cite book |title =Mexico and the United States |editor-last= Stacy| editor-first=Lee |publisher= Marshall Cavendish |page=146 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=DSzyMGh8pNwC&amp;pg=PA146&amp;dq=Mexico+United+States+treaty+of+1884&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CB4Q6AEwAGoVChMIxMvSw9-RxgIVkaKICh04rwA5#v=onepage&amp;q=Mexico%20United%20States%20treaty%20of%201884&amp;f=false|year=2003| isbn= 9780761474029 |accessdate= 2015-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The purpose of the 1905 convention was to eliminate these bancos from the effects of Article II of the US-Mexico Convention of 1884, to which they otherwise would have been subject, and to establish a more definitive means to settle matters.  Any bancos larger than {{convert|250|ha}} or with a population over 200 were excluded from the 1905 convention.&lt;ref name="C1905"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibwc.state.gov/Files/Convention_of_1905.pdf |title=Convention between the United States and Mexico for the Elimination of the Bancos in the Rio Grande from the Effects of Article II of the Treaty of November 12, 1884 (35 Stat.1863) |date=March 20, 1905 |accessdate=2015-06-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151009042029/http://www.ibwc.state.gov/Files/Convention_of_1905.pdf |archivedate=October 9, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effects==
The [[International Boundary and Water Commission]] was charged with implementing the convention.  Under the treaty, the following transfers involving [[Texas]] occurred from 1910–1976:&lt;ref name="Mueller"&gt;{{cite book |title=Restless River, International Law and the Behavior of the Rio Grande |publisher=Texas Western Press |author=Mueller, Jerry E. |year=1975 |pages=64 |isbn=9780874040500}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1927 under this convention, the U.S. acquired two bancos from Mexico at the [[Colorado River]] border with [[Arizona]]. Farmers Banco, covering {{cvt|583.4|acre|km2}}, a part of the [[Cocopah Indian Reservation]], was ceded to the U.S. with controversy.&lt;ref name="DOI"&gt;{{cite book| url=http://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015084910804| publisher=United States.

{{Close Relationships}}
A '''relationship breakup''', often referred to simply as a '''breakup''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/breakup?s=t|title=Breakup|publisher=Dictionary.com|accessdate=2012-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the termination of an [[intimate relationship]] by any means other than death. The act is commonly termed "dumping [someone]" in slang when it is initiated by one partner.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}} The term is less likely to be applied to a [[marriage|married couple]], where a breakup is typically called a [[Legal separation|separation]] or [[divorce]]. When a couple engaged to be married breaks up, it is typically called a "broken engagement".

[[Susie Orbach]] (1992) has argued that the dissolution of dating and cohabiting relationships can be as painful as or more painful than divorce because these nonmarital relationships are less socially recognized.&lt;ref&gt;John H. Harvey, ''Perspectives on Loss'' (1998) p. 106&lt;/ref&gt;

Kamiar-K. Rueckert argues with the works of [[Donald Winnicott]] that the ability to separate is an essentially healthy sign of emotional development and maturity. Once, a child has obtained closeness and attachment by his early caregivers, he or she is able to develop autonomy and identity. If children have not introjected the good and protective qualities of their parents, they will fear separation and break-ups.&lt;ref&gt;Kamiar-K. Rückert, Essay on Separation |url=https://www.theviennapsychoanalyst.at/index.php?wbkat=8&amp;wbid=1105&lt;/ref&gt;

==Models==
Several [[psychological]] models have been proposed to explain the process of a relationship breakup, many suggesting that 'relationship dissolution occurs in stages'.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, p. 106&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stages leading to a breakup===
L. Lee&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Lee, L. |url=http://spr.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/1/1/49 |title=Sequences in Separation: A Framework for Investigating Endings of the Personal (Romantic) Relationship |journal=Journal of Social and Personal Relationships |year=1984 |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=49–73 |doi=10.1177/0265407584011004 |access-date=2009-08-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061025051321/http://spr.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/1/1/49 |archive-date=2006-10-25 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; proposes that there are five stages ultimately leading up to a breakup.
{{Columns-list|colwidth=30em|
# '''Dissatisfaction''' – one or both partners grow dissatisfied with the relationship
# '''Exposure''' – both partners mutually become aware of the problems in the relationship
# '''Negotiation''' – both partners attempt to negotiate a solution to problems
# '''Resolution and transformation''' – both partners apply the outcome of their negotiation
# '''Termination''' – proposed resolution fails to rectify issues and no further solutions are accepted or applied
}}

===Cycle of a breakup===
Steve Duck outlines a six-stage cycle of relationship breakup,&lt;ref&gt;Steve Duck et al, ''The Basics of Communications'' (2011) p. 151 Table 6.2&lt;/ref&gt; including
{{Columns-list|colwidth=30em|
# '''Dissatisfaction''' with the relationship
# '''Social withdrawal'''
# '''Discussion''' of the reasons for the discontentment
# '''Going public'''
# '''Tidying up''' the memories
# '''Recreating''' sense of one's own social value
}}

===Factors that predict a breakup before marriage===

# '''Unequal involvement in the relationship
# '''Age difference'''
# '''Different educational aspirations'''
# '''Difference in intelligence'''
# '''Difference in physical attractiveness'''
}}

==Uncoupling theory==
In 1976, sociologist [[Diane Vaughan]] proposed an "uncoupling theory," where there exists a "turning point" in the dynamics of relationship breakup – 'a precise moment when they "knew the relationship was over," when "everything went dead inside"' – followed by a transition period in which one partner unconsciously knows the relationship is going to end, but holds on to it for an extended period, even for years.&lt;ref name="Vaughan"&gt;{{cite book |last=Vaughan |first=Diane  |title=Uncoupling – Turning Points in Intimate Relationships |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1986 |isbn=0-679-73002-8}} p. 81 and p. 218n&lt;/ref&gt;

Vaughan considered that the process of breakup was asymmetrical for initiator and respondent: the former 'has begun mourning the loss of the relationship and has undertaken something tantamount to a rehearsal, mentally and, to varying degrees, experientially, of a life apart from the partner'.&lt;ref&gt;Vaughan, p. 60&lt;/ref&gt; The latter then has to play catch-up: 'to make their own transition out of the relationship, partners must redefine initiator and relationship negatively, legitimating the dissolution'.&lt;ref&gt;Vaughan, p. 154&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result, for Vaughan 'getting out of a relationship includes a redefinition of self at several levels: in the private thoughts of the individual, between partners, and in the larger social context in which the relationship exists'.&lt;ref name="Vaughan, p. 6"&gt;Vaughan, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; She considered that 'uncoupling is complete when the partners have defined themselves and are defined by others as separate and independent of each other – when being partners is no longer a major source of identity'.&lt;ref name="Vaughan, p. 6"/&gt;

== Consequences ==

Breakups are extremely stressful, unpleasant, and traumatic events, regardless of whether the individual in question is the one who actively made the decision to end the relationship.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Eastwick|first=P.W.|last2=Finkel|first2=E.J.|last3=Krishnamurti|first3=T.|last4=Lowenstein|first4=G.|date=2008|title=Mispredicting distress following romantic breakup: Revealing the time course of the affective forecasting error|url=|journal=Journal of Experimental Social Psychology|volume=44 |issue=3|pages=800–807|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Collins|first=T.J.|last2=Gillath|first2=O.|date=2012|title=Attachment, breakup strategies, and associated outcomes: The effects of security enhancement on the selection of breakup strategies|url=|journal=Journal of Research in Personality|volume=46 |issue=2|pages=210–222|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both parties feel a large number of negative effects as a result of the relationship’s dissolution, and these events often gain the reputation for being some of the worst events in people’s lives.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tashiro|first=T.Y.|last2=Frazier|first2=P.|date=2003|title="I’ll never be in a relationship like that again": Personal growth following romantic relationship breakups|url=|journal=Personal Relationships|volume=10 |issue=1|pages=113–128|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=del Palacio-González|first=A.|last2=Clark|first2=D.A.|last3=O'Sullivan|first3=L.F.|date=2017|title=Distress severity following a romantic breakup is associated with positive relationship memories among emerging adults|url=|journal=Emerging Adulthood|volume=5 |issue=4|pages=259–267|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These include psychological distress symptoms, grief reactions, an overall decline of psychological well-being, and potential stalking behaviors. Individuals often work hard to keep their relationships intact because of how significantly distressing and problematic these negative effects can be, even in the face of potential complications in their relationship, for as long as they can bear it.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; While the negative symptoms observed may not necessarily fit the definitions of post-traumatic stress as described by the DSM-IV from the American Psychiatric Association, there are some certain symptoms that mirror those from extreme traumatic events and disasters in a person’s life.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chung|first=M.C.|last2=Farmer|first2=S.|last3=Grant|first3=K.|last4=Newton|first4=R.|last5=Payne|first5=S.|last6=Perry|first6=M.|last7=Saunders|first7=J.|last8=Smith|first8=C.|last9=Stone|first9=N.|date=2002|title=Self-esteem, personality and post-traumatic stress symptoms following the dissolution of a dating relationship|url=|journal=Stress and Health|volume=18|pages=83–90|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, not all individuals are exposed to the same level of impact following a breakup, as a result of several mitigating factors based on the quality of the relationship before the dissolution takes place.

=== Negative Effects ===

==== ''Psychological Distress Symptoms'' ====

Individuals who had just recently experienced the dissolution of a romantic relationship reported several symptoms of acute psychological distress. These included flashback and intrusive memories associated with their partner, often triggered by important dates associated with either the relationship or the breakup.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; These intrusive distress symptoms manifested in various ways for both the individual who initiated the breakup and their partner, such as being reminded of certain aspects of their behavior or their preferences.

Another set of psychological distress symptoms that were reported by individuals who had experienced a romantic relationship breakup fell under the category of avoidance behavior.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Samios|first=C.|last2=Henson|first2=D.F.|last3=Simpson|first3=H.J.|date=2014|title=Benefit finding and psychological adjustment following a non-marital relationship breakup|url=|journal=Journal of Relationships Research|volume=5 |issue=6|pages=1–8|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Being without their partner causes their self-concept to shift as they struggle through emotional distress.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Slotter|first=E.B.|last2=Gardner|first2=W.L.|last3=Finkel|first3=E.J.|date=2010|title=Who am I without you? The influence of romantic breakup on the self-concept|url=|journal=Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin|volume=36 |issue=2|pages=147–160|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This involves an active attempt at denying or ignoring the circumstances of the current situation, or those that led to the dissolution of the relationship. In relation to this, individuals also noted feeling numb and uninterested with the world around them because of the breakup.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

The combination of this desire to engage in avoidance behaviors and the intrusive memories that may naturally come up cause individuals to feel significant emotional swings and outbursts in the form of irritation, anger, and startle responses. Individuals were noted as being far more paranoid, suspicious, and jealous, often tied towards a desire to know information about their ex-partner.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Overall, these psychological distress symptoms come together to result in a significantly lower level of self-esteem among individuals who have just underwent the dissolution of a romantic relationship.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Additionally, individuals undergo a significant redefinition of their self-concept, as they attempt to understand who they are without their ex-partner.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; This compounds upon the psychological distress symptoms that they feel from the loss of the relationship and is the most significant negative effect that people undergoing a breakup experience.

==== ''Grief Reactions'' ====

A natural effect of the loss of a relationship that an individual had hoped to keep is grief, because the desire to keep relationships intact despite problems and complications is a natural human desire.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This results in individuals undergoing a breakup displaying grief reactions that include symptoms like sleeplessness, depression, and thoughts about suicide.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mearns|first=J.|date=1991|title=Coping with a breakup: negative mood regulation expectancies and depression following the end of a romantic relationship|url=|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=60 |issue=2|pages=327–34|via=|pmid=2016673}}&lt;/ref&gt; This tendency to express grief and depression is so prevalent that researchers point to it being a significant contributor to the first onset of major depressive disorder in young adults.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

The extent of these grief reactions is not limited to the time frame immediately following the dissolution of the romantic relationship. Even some time after the breakup, people who are asked to recall depressing or negative events in their lives commonly make reference to traumatic events of this nature.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This negative effect can be attributed to the severity of the grief reaction that people who suffer through a breakup display, making a significant mark in their lives that they are unlikely to forget.

==== ''Decline in Psychological Well-being'' ====
In addition to these specific negative effects, individuals who are suffering through a breakup report a general decline in their psychological well-being. The general negative emotion that they feel often triggers other behaviors and habits that are either detrimental to their mental health or signify poor mental health conditions.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; These include:

*increased alcohol use
*weight loss
*worsening physical health
*admissions to psychiatric services
*increased criminal behavior
*increased risk of suicide
*negative emotions and feelings (such as guilt, anger, or rejection)

==== ''Stalking Behaviors'' ====
A behavior that has been noticed following some breakups is the prevalence of stalking as one partner attempts to maintain unwanted contact from another. This type of behavior exists on a scale that stretches from an amicable breakup with no unwanted harassment behaviors all the way to stalking behaviors that are threatening and distressful to the partner.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Roberts|first=K.A.|date=2002|title=Stalking following the breakup of romantic relationships: Characteristics of stalking former partners|url=|journal=Journal of Forensic Science|volume=47 |issue=5|pages=1–8|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This behavior stems from an unhappiness with the circumstances following the dissolution of the relationship, as well as a misguided belief that the stalking behavior may result in the reforming of the relationship. This is partly due to the observation that there is no clear definition of stalking behavior that differentiate it from social acceptable activities, instead focusing on the persistent and unwanted nature of the acts being committed by the individual.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

=== Positive Effects ===

Evidence shows that even in the direst of situations, there is a chance for positive emotions and growth.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Breakups are no different, giving victims opportunities for stress-related growth, improving their performance in future relationships, and providing feelings of relief and freedom.

==== ''Stress-Related Growth'' ====
Individuals that are placed under stressful situations are often faced with an opportunity for growth and development as a result of this stress. Without this push to improve, individuals are often pushed towards complacency and refuse to make the necessary efforts to progress through life. Different ways in which people have exhibited growth following a stressful life event include improvements to the way a person views themselves, the way they connect with other people around them, or their overall approach to life. Research shows that breakups are highly representative of this type of stressful situation, as individuals experience them several times throughout their lives and have been known to self-report instances of growth because of the experience.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==== ''Improved Future Relationships'' ====
Another positive outcome that has been observed to follow breakup has to do with the lessons that people may have learned from going through the painful experience. The stress-related growth that a person is forced to experience following a breakup causes improvements to their overall character, self-image, and ability to interact with others. These improvements have the potential to improve the quality of future romantic relationships with other people.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This is due to the increased level of maturity displayed by the individual as well as, to a lesser extent, insight into certain things that they must avoid in a relationship to ensure satisfaction from their partners.

==== ''Feelings of Relief and Freedom'' ====

While this may not necessarily a universal positive consequence that affects all people going through a breakup, there is significant evidence towards certain individuals experiencing feelings of relief, freedom, and happiness following the end of a relationship.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yıldırım|first=F.B.|last2=Demir|first2=A.|date=2015|title=Breakup adjustment in young adulthood|url=|journal=Journal of Counseling and Development|volume=93 |issue=1|pages=38–44|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a high likelihood that these individuals were the one who initiated the breakup in the first place, but research has shown that there have been cases where individuals that have been victims of a breakup recognize that their past relationship was sub-optimal, which allows them to display the same emotions of relief, freedom, and happiness.

=== Mitigating Factors ===
While individuals that have experienced a breakup are likely to experience a number of different positive and negative effects once the relationship has run its course, different people can be expect these to manifest in varying degrees. This is because there are several mitigating factors that can either minimize or amplify the extent to which one feels the consequences of a breakup. The list of potential factors that have been shown to moderate the effects that an individual might feel are categorized and listed below:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Smith|first=H.S.|last2=Cohen|first2=L.H.|date=1993|title=Self-complexity and reactions to a relationship breakup|url=|journal=Journal of Social and Clinical Psychology|volume=12 |issue=4|pages=367–384|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Relationship Quality
** Duration of relationship – relationships with longer durations are more likely to be more painful after the breakup
** Admission of love for ex-partner – relationships that report to be filled with love may exacerbate the consequences that victims feel following a breakup
** Satisfaction levels of both parties – relationships that report both parties feeling satisfied are more likely to suffer during breakups
** Level of investment in maintaining the relationship – high levels of relationship investment translate to a much larger loss caused by the dissolution of the romantic relationship
** Proportion of positive and negative relationship memories – individuals that had a high number of positive relationship memories were less negatively affected by the breakup when compared to those that would constantly dredge up negative memories of their ex-partner
* Romantic Situation following Breakup
** Ease of finding alternative partner – being able to find a new partner immediately following a breakup allowed the individual to better weather the negative emotions and problems associated with the dissolution of a romantic relationship
** Willingness to begin a new relationship – an openness to the formation of a new relationship was shown to translate to a lower level of victimization and negative consequences after a breakup
* Circumstances of the Breakup
** Initiator of the dissolution of the relationship – while both the initiator and the victim were shown to experience consequences following the breakup, the former displayed less of these symptoms and in some cases experienced positive effects because of the relationship ended
** Certainty of the reasons for the breakup – being unsure about the initiator’s reasons for breaking up caused higher levels of anxiety and other stress symptoms in the victim, while achieving closure was an important step for most individuals seeking to move on from a breakup
* Characteristics of the Participants
** Hardiness – individuals that displayed above average levels of hardiness were unfazed by the dissolution of their romantic relationship and were less likely to be bothered by its consequences
** Attachment style – fearful attachment styles were correlated with significantly more stressful consequences during the breakup process
** Self-esteem levels – high levels of self-esteem allow people to be less stressed during the dissolution of a relationship and alleviate the most severe negative consequences
** Mental health – individuals that display lower levels of mental health and substance abuse have reported magnified consequence levels when going through the breakup process
** Self-complexity – people that exhibit a complex self-image, which references an ability to perceive oneself as more than just who they are in their romantic relationship, are less likely to be debilitated by the consequences of a breakup
** Gender – several studies observed that females exhibited larger negative symptoms during the breakup process
* Implementation of Coping Strategies
** Distancing – avoiding the problem has been observed to translate to negative coping outcomes and a worsening of the consequences reported by the victim, while a willingness to confront the matter and engage in problem-solving has shown overall mitigative effects to breakup consequences
** Benefit-finding – the willingness to objectively assess the relationship, as well as an ability to find benefits that resulted from its ending allowed victims to display less stress symptoms during the breakup process
** Perceived social support – individuals that felt like people in their social group were on their side and would give them the support they need during this stressful time reported being less affected by the breakup and loss of a romantic relationship

'''''Brown and Davis v Galbraith''''' [1972] 1 WLR 997 is an [[English unjust enrichment law]] case, concerning to what extent enrichment of the defendant must be at the expense of the claimant.

==Facts==
Brown and Davis sued Mr Galbraith for their price in repairing Mr Galbraith’s [[Lotus Cars|Lotus]] after a collision, because his insurer had gone insolvent. Mr Galbraith's comprehensive [[insurance]] policy, said he would pay £25 on any claim, and the insurance company would cover the rest. The garage's quote was labour costs of £165, and spare parts coming up to £373, with the excess deducted. The insurers’ assessor completed a document on 21 July 1970 authorising repair only at a lower sum, though Mr Galbraith was not told. It said ‘To be collected by repairer – excess £25 and contribution £4 10s to towing’. And ‘N.B. The insured’s confirmation should be obtained concerning these items.’ The work was done, Mr Galbraith collected the car, the garage billed the insurer, but Mr Galbraith did not agree the repairs were satisfactory and so the insurers did not pay. The garage sued Mr Galbraith in the County Court. The insurance company went insolvent. The repairers agreed they had looked to the insurers for payment generally.

Croydon County Court Judge held there were two contracts, one between the insurers and the garage in the 21 July document, and two an implied contract between the garage and the owner for payment if the insurers did not come up. Therefore the owner could be liable for the full sum.

==Judgment==
Cairns LJ held there was an implied contract between the garage and Mr Galbraith. But the facts did not show the owner contracted to pay anything beyond £25. Therefore the extra £4 10s could not be recovered. It was not necessary to imply a contract, beyond the £25 excess that Mr Galbraith had undertaken to pay.

Buckley LJ gave a concurring judgment, finding there was no evidence for an inference for implying a contract to pay over the excess.&lt;ref&gt;[1972] 1 WLR 997, 1006&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Cquote|Now, the inference of such an implied contract can, in my judgment, only be drawn if it is a matter of necessary inference, that is to say, if it is an inference which the business realities of the situation really make necessary to make sense of the dealings between the parties so that they can be implemented in a sensible manner.}}

Sachs LJ gave a concurring judgment.

A '''clerical error''' is an error on the part of an [[office worker]], often a [[secretary]] or [[personal assistant]].  It is a phrase which can also be used as an excuse to deflect blame away from specific individuals, such as high-powered [[executive (management)|executives]], and instead redirect it to the more anonymous clerical staff.

A clerical error in a legal document is called a '''scrivener's error'''. 

== In law ==

{{see also|Mistake (contract law)}}

There is a considerable body of [[case law]] concerning the proper treatment of a scrivener's error.&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;See ''Barkelew v. Barkelew'' (1946, Cal App) 73 Cal App 2d 76, 166 P2d 57, for example.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, where the parties to a [[contract]] make an [[oral agreement]] that, when reduced to a writing, is mistranscribed, the [[plaintiff|aggrieved party]] is entitled to [[redress|reformation]] so that the writing corresponds to the oral agreement.&lt;ref&gt;Flemings Fundamentals of Law/Farhod Azarbaydjani&lt;/ref&gt;

A scrivener's error can be grounds for an [[appellate court]] to [[remand (court procedure)|remand]] a decision back to the [[trial court]]. For example, in ''Ortiz v. State of Florida,''&lt;ref&gt;600 So. 2d 530 (Fla. App. 3 DCA 1992)&lt;/ref&gt; Ortiz had been [[Criminal conviction|convicted]] of possession of less than 20 [[Gram|g]] of [[marijuana]], a [[misdemeanor]].&lt;ref&gt;893.13(1)(g) Fla. Stat. (1989)&lt;/ref&gt; However, Ortiz was mistakenly [[criminal conviction|adjudicated guilty]] of a [[felony]] for the count of [[drug possession|marijuana possession]]. The appellate court held that "we must remand the case to the trial court to correct a scrivener's error."

In some circumstances, courts can also correct scrivener's errors found in primary legislation.&lt;ref&gt;David M Sollors, War on Error: The Scrivener's Error Doctrine and Textual Criticism: Confronting Errors in Statutes and Literary Texts, Santa Clara Law Review, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
Over 18 minutes of the [[Watergate tapes]] were erased by [[Richard Nixon]]'s secretary in a claimed clerical error.  Some writers have suggested that this may have changed the course of American history.&lt;ref&gt;[[Time (magazine)|Time Magazine]], December 10, 1973&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A30678-2005Jan23.html |title=Rose Mary Woods Dies; Loyal Nixon Secretary |publisher=washingtonpost.com |date= |accessdate=2014-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Collection administration of copyrights''' describes the use of [[copyright collective|collective societies]] to manage [[licenses]] for copyrighted material belonging to more than one copyright owner. These collective societies are responsible for granting permission to use the works they manage and setting out what conditions users of their works must follow. Examples of collective societies in Canada include: Christian Video Licensing International (licensing audiovisual programs to religious institutions) and the Canadian Broadcasters Rights Agency (licensing of programming owned by Canadian television stations and networks.)

Reasons justifying the practice of collective administration of copyrights often pertain to debates over the [[economic efficiency]] of such policies. Collective administration of copyrights in Canada differs from collective administration policies in other [[common law]] jurisdictions such as the United States and United Kingdom. Consequently, the justifications for Canadian collective administration will not necessarily be identical to that of other systems.

==Legal Regime==

The expression "collective society" was defined in Canada by the [[Bill C-32]] amendment of the ''[[Copyright Act of Canada]]'' in 1997. Although [[Parliament of Canada|Parliament]] was dissolved before Bill C-32 made it through its second reading, Bill C-11, which contains identical language, has since been reintroduced by Parliament:

{{quote|"Collective society" means a society, association or corporation that carries on the business of collective administration of copyright or of the remuneration right conferred by section 19 or 81 for the benefit of those who, by assignment, grant of licence, appointment of it as their agent or otherwise, authorize it to act on their behalf in relation to that collective administration, and (a) operates a licensing scheme, applicable in relation to a repertoire of works, performer’s performances, sound recordings or communication signals of more than one author, performer, sound recording maker or broadcaster, pursuant to which the society, association or corporation sets out classes of uses that it agrees to authorize under this Act, and the royalties and terms and conditions on which it agrees to authorize those classes of uses, or (b) carries on the business of collecting and distributing royalties or levies payable pursuant to this Act&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite canlaw|short title  = Copyright Act of Canada|abbr=|year=1985|chapter=|section=2|wikilink=Copyright Act of Canada|link=http://laws.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-42/page-1.html|linkloc=Department of Justice|amended1=R.S.C., 1985, c. C-42}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This definition divides collective societies into four legal regimes: music and performing rights, general collective administration, particular cases (retransmissions and certain educational uses), and private copying levies.

===Music Performing Rights===

The performance or telecommunication of musical works and sound recordings of musical works is regulated in s.67 of the Copyright Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite canlaw|short title=Copyright Act of Canada|abbr=|year=1985|chapter=|section=67|wikilink=Copyright Act of Canada|link=http://laws.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-42/page-1.html|linkloc=Department of Justice|amended1=R.S.C., 1985, c. C-42}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Although authors may theoretically protect their copyrighted works without participating in a collective, in practice the [[Society of Composers, Authors and Music Publishers of Canada]] (SOCAN) holds virtually all musical works performed in Canada within its repertoire.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel J. Gervais. "A Uniquely Canadian Institution: The Copyright Board of Canada" An Emerging Intellectual Property Paradigm. Ed. Ysolde Gendreau. Cheltenham, UK: Edward Elgar, 2008. 197-223. pg 200&lt;/ref&gt;

===General Regime===

Voluntary licensing schemes that do not fall under s.67 fall instead within s.70.1 barring the existence of another applicable regulatory scheme. Nonetheless, collective management organizations under s.67 collect and distribute more funds than those under s.70.1.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite canlaw|short title=Copyright Act of Canada|abbr=|year=1985|chapter=|section=71|wikilink=Copyright Act of Canada|link=http://laws.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-42/page-1.html|linkloc=Department of Justice|amended1=R.S.C., 1985, c. C-42}}&lt;/ref&gt; In practice, the following types of copyrights are covered by the general regime:

*reprography is regulated by [[Access Copyright]] or COPIBEC
*mechanical rights
*visual arts
*sound recordings and music videos
*audiovisual and multimedia rights
*off-air program taping
*other areas

===Retransmissions and Use by Educational Institutions===

Sections 71-76 of the ''Copyright Act'' create a regime regulating involuntary licences for the retransmission of distant radio and televisions signals and the reproduction and public performance by education institutions of radio and television programs for educational or training purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite canlaw|short title=Copyright Act of Canada|abbr=|year=1985|chapter=|section=71-76|wikilink=Copyright Act of Canada|link=http://laws.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-42/page-1.html|linkloc=Department of Justice|amended1=R.S.C., 1985, c. C-42}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eight retransmission copyright management organizations are covered at least in part by this regime:

*Border Broadcasters' Inc.
*Canadian Broadcasters Rights Agency
*Canadian Retransmission Collective
*Canadian Retransmission Right Association
*Copyright Collective of Canada
*FWS Join Sports Claimants
*Major League Baseball Collective of Canada
*Society of Composers, Authors and Music Publishers of Canada

===Private Copying===

Private copying of sound recordings is dealt with by a regime established in 1998 specifically for that purpose. This regime makes an exception to copyright infringement for copies of music for private use. The regime does not involve licensing. Instead it remunerates copyright holders by collecting funds through the Canadian Private Copying Collective and sets out a share of these funds which all eligible authors, performers, and makers or record producers are entitled.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel J. Gervais. "A Uniquely Canadian Institution: The Copyright Board of Canada" An Emerging Intellectual Property Paradigm. Ed. Ysolde Gendreau. Cheltenham, UK: Edward Elgar, 2008. 197-223. pg 206&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Copyright Board==

The [[Copyright Board of Canada]] is an independent administrative tribunal consisting of at most five members appointed to five year terms by the government. A small permanent staff is provided to the Board which includes a Secretary General, General Counsel and Director of Research and Analysis. Unique among Canadian regulatory agencies, the Chairman of the Board tends to be drawn from sitting or retired judges of a superior court. The reasons for this are entirely historical.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel J. Gervais. "A Uniquely Canadian Institution: The Copyright Board of Canada" An Emerging Intellectual Property Paradigm. Ed. Ysolde Gendreau. Cheltenham, UK: Edward Elgar, 2008. 197-223. pg 210&lt;/ref&gt;

===Procedures===

Proposed tariffs must be filed before March 31 of the year before the year in which the tariff will come into effect. Proposed tariffs are published by the Board in the ''[[Canada Gazette]]''. Objections by users to this proposal must be filed within 60 days following the Gazette's publication. These objections may then be decided before a panel with the procedures and timetable issued by the Board. Although the rules of evidence are not binding for the Board, the Board does provide written reasons for its decision.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel J. Gervais. "A Uniquely Canadian Institution: The Copyright Board of Canada" An Emerging Intellectual Property Paradigm. Ed. Ysolde Gendreau. Cheltenham, UK: Edward Elgar, 2008. 197-223. pg 211&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms of Collective Administration==

===Delays and Inefficiencies===

The Copyright Board's ability to handle the volume of complaints that arise from collective administration of copyright has often been characterized as slow and expensive. Legal scholars have argued that a number of structural elements of the Canadian system contribute to these inefficiencies including mandatory filing of tariffs by collective management organizations and the Board's inability to award costs.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel J. Gervais. "A Uniquely Canadian Institution: The Copyright Board of Canada" An Emerging Intellectual Property Paradigm. Ed. Ysolde Gendreau. Cheltenham, UK: Edward Elgar, 2008. 197-223. pg 218&lt;/ref&gt;

===Formation of Unnecessary Monopolies===

It can be argued that collective administration of copyright creates monopolies that lead to economic inefficiencies. Collective management organizations, for example, are only capable of categorizing different copyrighted works into broad categories due to the limitations of regulatory specificity. Consequently, some copyrighted works will be licensed according to the average value of the works in the same category and not the value of the specific work.
&lt;ref name="Katz"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Katz |first1=Ariel |year=2005 |title= The Potential Demise of Another Natural Monopoly: Rethinking the Collective Administration of Performing Rights |journal=Journal of Competition Law and Economics |volume=1 |issue=3 |pages=541–593 |doi=10.1093/joclec/nhi018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The failure to provide a license based on the value of the specific work in question means that payments to copy copyrighted works do not reflect the actual value of the copying.

Legal scholars such as Ariel Katz have argued that these inefficiencies may be unnecessary as there exist reasonable alternatives to collective administration of copyright, especially with the immergence of new technology that might facilitate alternative systems of managing copyright licensing.&lt;ref name = "Katz"/&gt; The idea that effective administration of copyright licenses necessitates single entity monopolies may be argued against, for example, by considering copyright regimes in which licensing is regulated by multiple collective management organizations without any apparent ill-effect.&lt;ref name = "Katz"/&gt; In addition Katz cites the "[[superstar#Economics of "superstars"|superstar phenomenon]]" which recognizes that the vast majority of copyright royalties are payments for works belonging to a disproportionately small number of individuals. Given that license sales are actually not widely dispersed among copyright owners, Katz argues that there is no reason to suppose that direct transactions between licensees and copyright holders would be impractical.&lt;ref name = "Katz"/&gt;

The '''Colorado Criminal Defense Bar''' (founded May 8, 1979) is a [[professional association]] of [[Attorney at law (United States)|attorney]]s, [[Private investigator|investigator]]s, and [[paralegal]]s who represent persons accused of [[crime]].  The '''CCDB''' (as it is abbreviated) was created and established by attorneys Michael F. DiManna, Harold A. Haddon, Gary M. Jackson, Bryan Morgan, and Peter H. Ney, a Judge of the Colorado Court of Appeals — all of [[Denver, Colorado]] — and William Gray of [[Boulder, Colorado]] (CCDB website). The "President's Council" comprises "former presidents of the CCDB and is chaired by the current President of the CCDB" ("President's Council", CCDB website).

The '''Court of Cassation''' ({{lang-fr|Cour de cassation}}; {{IPA-fr|kuʁ.də.kɑ.saˈsjɔ̃}}) is one of the four [[Court of last resort|courts of last resort]] in [[France]]. It has [[jurisdiction]] over all civil and criminal matters triable in the [[Judiciary of France#Judicial Stream|judicial system]], and is the supreme [[court of appeal]] in these cases. It has jurisdiction to review the law, and to certify qestions of law, to determine miscarriages of justice. The Court is located in the [[Palais de Justice, Paris|Palace of Justice]] in [[Paris]].

The Court does not have juisdiction over cases involving claims against administrators or public bodies, which fall within the jurisdiction of [[administrative court]]s, for which the [[Council of State (France)|Council of State]] acts as the supreme court of appeal; nor over cases involving constitutional issues, which fall within the jurisdiction of the [[Constitutional Council of France|Constitutional Council]]; nor over cases involving disputes about which of these  courts has jusridiction, which are heard by the [[Judiciary of France#Jurisdictional court|Jurisdictional Disputes Tribunal]]. Collectively, these four courts form the topmost tier of the French court system.

The Court was established in 1790 under the name ''Tribunal de cassation'' during the [[French Revolution]], and its original purpose was to act as a court of error with revisory jurisdiction over lower provincial [[prerogative court]]s (''[[Parlement]]s'').&lt;ref&gt;[[Serge Guinchard]], André Varinard and Thierry Debard, ''Institutions juridictionnelles'' (= Judicials institutions), 11th edn., (Paris: Dalloz, 2011).&lt;/ref&gt; However, much about the Court continues the earlier [[Parlement|Paris Parlement]].

The Court is the seat of the [[Network of the Presidents of the Supreme Judicial Courts of the European Union]].

==Composition==
[[File:Cour de Cassation, Paris 140320 1.jpg|thumb|The building of the Court of Cassation]]
The Court is made up of justices, the [[Ministère public (France)|Office of the Prosecutor]], and an Administrative Office of Courts. In addition, a separate bar of specially certified [[barrister]]s exists for trying cases at the French Court.

===Judges and divisions===
Overall, the Court consists of nearly 85 trial judges (''conseillers'') and about 40 deputy judges&lt;ref&gt;A Canadian term; known as an associate judge in Australia and a magistrate judge in America.&lt;/ref&gt; (''conseillers référendaires''), each divided among six different divisions (''chambres''):
*First Civil Division (''première chambre civile'') deals with family law, successions (wills), child custody, professional discipline, individual rights, contractual liability
*Second Civil Division (''deuxième chambre civile'') handles divorce, [[tort]]s, and electoral matters
*Third Civil Division (''troisième chambre civile'') (or "Land Court") for immovable property (real estate), housing, city planning, leases, foreclosures
*Commercial Division (''chambre commerciale, financière et économique'') handles companies, bankruptcy, business, banking and intellectual property
*Labor Division (''chambre sociale'') handles labor disputes, worker compensation, and welfare
*Criminal Division (''chambre criminelle'') deals with criminal cases

Each division is headed by a presiding justice&lt;ref&gt;Depending on what English you speak, a presiding judge may simply be the judge trying the case or the senior-most justice on a Bench. In Canada, this position is referred to as "senior judge", though in most English-speaking countries this refers to any high-level judge and in America to a semi-retired elderly judge. In France this is the highest-ranking judge in the division&lt;/ref&gt; referred to in French as a ''président'', or President of Division. The Chief Justice bears the title of the ''premier président'', or President of the Court, who supervises the presiding justices of the various divisions. The Chief Justice is the highest-ranking judicial officer in the country and is responsible for administration of the Court and the discipline of justices. The current Chief Justice is {{Interlanguage link multi|Bertrand Louvel|fr}}. The Court also includes 12 [[Master (judiciary)|masters]] (''auditeurs''), the lowest rank of justice, who are primarily concerned with administration.

There is, in addition to the abovementioned six divisions, a separate organization known as the Divisional Court (''chambre mixte''). The Divisional Court adjudicates where the subject matter of an appeal falls within the purview of multiple divisions. The Bench of the Divisional Court seats the Chief Justice and a number of other judges from at least three other divisions relevant to a given case. Any participating division is represented by its Presiding Justice and two [[puisne]] judges.

Finally, a [[Full Court]] (''[[:wikt:assemblée|Assemblée]] [[:wikt:fr:plénière|plénière]]'') is called, presided over by the Chief Justice or, if he is absent, by the most senior presiding justice. It also seat by all divisional presiding justices and senior justices assisted by a puisne judge from each division. The Full Court is the highest level of the Court.&lt;ref&gt;Serge Braudo and Alexis Baumann, ''Dictionnaire juridique'', s.v. "Assemblée plénière" (2008): [http://www.dictionnaire-juridique.com/definition/assemblee-pleniere.php]. Retrieved 3 February 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Office of the Prosecutor===
The [[Ministère public (France)|prosecution]], or ''[[Parquet (legal)|parquet]] général'', is headed by the Chief Prosecutor (''[[procureur général]]'').&lt;ref&gt;Not completely analogous to prosecutor in [[common law]] jurisdictions, as investigations are carried out by the ''juge d'instruction''. But the prosecutor is in charge of presenting the case against a defendant.&lt;/ref&gt; The Chief Prosecutor is a judicial officer, but does not actually prosecute cases; instead, his function is to advise the Court on how to proceed, analogous to the Commissioner-in-Council's&lt;ref&gt;appears to be a Canadian advisor to the Governor-General, in Canada, ie a common law jurisdiction, so the analogy should possibly be taken with a grain of salt&lt;/ref&gt; role within the [[Conseil d'État (France)|Conseil d'État]] (lit. Council of State, but function may vary). Duties include filing originating motions to bring cases before the Court "in the name of the law" and bringing cases before the French Court of Justice (''Cour de justice de la République''), which tries government officials for crimes committed while in office. The Chief Prosecutor is assisted by two Chief Deputy Prosecutors (''premiers avocats généraux'') and a staff of about 22 deputy prosecutors (''avocats généraux''), and 2 assistant prosecutors (''substituts'').

===Supreme Court bar===
[[Barristers]] (''avocats''), though not technically officers of the Court, play an integral role in the due dispensing of justice. Except for a few types of actions, advocate counsel in the form of a barrister is mandatory for any case heard at the Court or Council of State. Barristers with exclusive rights of audience and admitted to practice law in either senior court carry the title of ''avocat au Conseil d'État et à la Cour de Cassation'', or ''avocats aux Conseils'' ("Counsel at Senior Court") for short. Admission to the Supreme Court bar&lt;ref&gt;For more (in French): [http://www.ordre-avocats-cassation.fr].&lt;/ref&gt; is particularly difficult, requiring special training and passing a notoriously stringent examination. Once admitted, bar members can advise litigants on whether their actions are justiciable, that is, issuable and exceeding [[de minimis]] requirements—an important service since the Court only hears appeals on points of law and not issues of fact. Membership is restricted to 60 total positions and is considered a public office.

==Proceedings==
The Court's main purpose is to review lower court rulings on the grounds of legal or procedural error. As the highest court of law in France, it also has other duties.

===Appeals===
The Court has inherent appellate jurisdiction for appeals (called ''pourvois en cassation'') from courts of appeal or, for certain types of small claims cases not appealable to appellate courts, from courts of record. The Supreme Court reviews the appeal on the record and may affirm or set aside lower court rulings; if set aside, the ruling is said to be ''cassé'' (French for "quashed"), hence the French name of ''Cour de cassation'', or "Quashing Court". The Court adjudicates by strict appeal, or appeal ''stricto sensu'', which is limited to review of the decision and of the decision-making process on a point of law, and may only allow the appeal in cases of serious error; fresh evidence is not admissible. The typical outcome of a successful appeal is setting aside of the lower court's decision and remittal for reconsideration.

An intermediate [[appellate court]], the [[Court of Appeal (France)|Cour d'appel]], hears general appeals ''de novo'' on points of law and procedure as well as errors of fact and reasoning. The Court of Cassation only decides matters of points of law or procedure on the record, as opposed to factual errors. Lower courts may petition the Court for an [[interlocutory]] order during the proceedings on any new and complex point of law; any such order, however, is not final or conclusive.

===Appeal procedure===
A case is heard by a bench of three or five relevant divisional justices. For either civil or criminal appeals, the bench seats by three judges unless the Chief Justice or the divisional presiding justice orders a Full Bench of five judges. Furthermore, any one of the three judges originally assigned to the Bench may order it expanded to five. If the case falls in the legal areas handled by more than one division, the Chief Justice may order the Divisional Court, rather than a Bench, to consider the case.

The Court can affirm a decision from below by dismissing the appeal (''rejet du pourvoi'') or overturn or amend the decision by allowing the appeal (''accueil du pourvoi'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dictionnaire-juridique.com/definition/pourvoi.php|title=Définition de Pourvoi|work=Dictionnaire du droit privé|author=Serge Braudo}}&lt;/ref&gt; If it finds that the lower court erred, it sets aside the lower court decision and remits the case with its opinion to an appellate court for reconsideration (''cassation avec renvoi''). If only a portion of a ruling is overturned, it is called ''cassation partielle'', or partial setting aside. Sometimes, the Court may overturn a lower court ruling and judge the case ''ex proprio motu'' without being petitioned (''cassation sans renvoi''), as long as the merits and facts of the case are on record.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

When overturned, the case is remanded to a second appellate court, in other words not the appellate court whose decision is being appealed; never to the same judges. The decision of the Bench of the Court of Cassation or Divisional Court is not binding on the lower court, and the appellate court has full discretion to decide the case, but the higher court's ruling has persuasive authority. The appellate court's ruling may again be appealed to the Court of Cassation. If so, the Full Court hears and judges the case. It may, again, uphold an earlier decision or reverse it and remand the case to another appellate court. In the latter case, the determination of the Full Court is binding; the facts, however, may be reviewed by the court retrying the case.

Published judgments are extremely brief, containing a statement of the case—citing relevant statutory authorities—and a summary of ruling. The ruling does not contain a [[ratio decidendi]] in the style of [[common law|common-law]] jurisdictions.&lt;ref&gt;The ''[[ratio decidendi]]'', which largely lays out judicial interpretation of law, is important for common-law jurisdictions because rulings are determined largely through case law whereas in civil law countries like France, procedurally speaking, courts are formally forbidden to interpret law and do not rule based on case law.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Serge Guinchard]], Cécile Chainais, Frédérique Ferrand, ''Civil procedure'', Paris, Dalloz editor, 30th edition, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, it is left to legal experts to explain the importance of rulings. The Court often drastically changes the way the [[Civil Code]] or other statutory laws are interpreted. Legal digests, such as the ''[[Recueil Dalloz]]'', and treatises written by legal scholars analyze and explain rulings through precedents. Much of this information is available through online databases.

Unlike common-law jurisdictions, there is no doctrine of binding precedent ([[stare decisis]]) in France. Therefore, previous decisions of higher courts do not bind lower courts in the same hierarchy, though they are often followed and have persuasive authority. Instead, the French legal system subscribes to the legal doctrine of ''[[jurisprudence constante]]'' according to which courts should follow a series of decisions that are in accord with each other and judges should rule on their own interpretation of the law.

====Criminal appeals====
Major [[felony|felonies]] ([[indictable offence]]s), called ''crimes'' in French, are tried by jury in a [[Departments of France|county]] [[Cour d'assises|Court of Assizes]]. In the past, their decisions were not open to appeal in an intermediate appellate court, and before 2001, could only be appealed to the Supreme Court. The Court would review the case on points of procedure and law only, and when handing down a reversal, which was uncommon except for capital punishment cases, vested a second [[Cour d'assises|Court of Assizes]] to retry the case. An argument in favor of this system was that allowing appeals to be tried by active judges after having been decided by a jury would in essence deny [[popular sovereignty]]. Since 2001, Assize court rulings may be appealed on points of fact to a Court of Assizes in another county, vested by the Court, and before a larger jury. The case is then fully retried. For procedural issues, appeals to the Supreme Court are still possible since assize courts, which operate by jury trial, would not be competent to hear them.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

====Certified questions====
Where no appeal has been made but the government disagrees with the lower court's interpretation of the law, it may order the Chief Prosecutor to "lay an appeal before the Court in the interest of law" (''former un pourvoi dans l'intérêt de la loi''), i.e., appeal to [[Certified question|certify a question]] of general public importance. The Chief Prosecutor may do so ''[[sua sponte]]'' or at the Court's behest in either civil or criminal cases. The Court will then issue an [[advisory opinion]] which has no bearing on the lower court's ruling since it was satisfactory to all parties involved and no motion was made to appeal. If the government is dissatisfied with the law as stated by the courts, it may ask Parliament to rewrite the law, as long as no constitutional issue is involved.

===Other duties===
The Court publishes an annual report on the French court system. The report includes a section with suggested changes to laws concerning the legal system, including [[criminal procedure]]. The Court awards [[damages]] to defendants exonerated after [[incarceration]]. Some high-level members of the court are [[ex officio]] members of special ad hoc courts; the investigatory commission of the High Court of Justice (''Haute Cour de Justice''), which may be convened to try the [[President of France|French President]] for [[high treason]]; the [[Cour de Justice de la République|French Court of Justice]] (''Cour de Justice de la République''), which may be convened to try current or former cabinet [[Minister (government)|ministers]] for crimes committed while in office; and the National Judicial Council (''Conseil supérieur de la magistrature''), which serves as a court of judicial discipline and disciplinary counsel. The High Court of Justice has never been convened during the [[French Fifth Republic|Fifth Republic]] and the French Court of Justice, only rarely.

==Other related courts==
The Court is not the only court of last resort in France. Cases involving claims against government bodies, local authorities, or the central government, including all [[delegated legislation]] (e.g., [[statutory instrument]]s, ministerial orders), are heard by the administrative courts, for which the court of last resort is the [[Conseil d'État (France)|Conseil d'État]]. In cases where there appears to be concurrent jurisdiction or a conflict of laws between the judicial and administrative courts, whether both retain jurisdiction ("positive dispute") or decline jurisdiction ("negative dispute"), the Jurisdictional Disputes Court (''Tribunal des Conflits'') decides the issue. The Court is composed of 4 members from both senior courts and occasionally, to break a tie, the justice minister who, if present, presides.

Neither court has the [[judicial review|power]] to strike down [[primary legislation]] such as acts of Parliament). The courts can, however, refuse to apply any statutory provision they consider inconsistent with France's international [[treaty]] obligations. Constitutional review lies in the [[Constitutional Council of France|Constitutional Council]], which can strike down any law that it deems [[Constitution of France|unconstitutional]]. Before a law is enacted, the [[President of France|French President]], the speaker of either house of Parliament, or, more commonly, 60 parliamentarians from the same house may petition the Council for review. Some laws, mostly constitutional laws (''loi organique''), come before the Constitutional Council for review without first being petitioned. Courts may adopt a restrictive approach to applying statute. A 2009 reform, effective on 1 March 2010, enables parties to a lawsuit or trial to question the constitutionality of the law that is being applied to them. The procedure, known as ''question prioritaire de constitutionnalité'', is broadly as follows: the question is raised before the trial judge and, if it has merit, it is forwarded to the appropriate supreme court (Council of State if the referral comes from an administrative court, Cour de Cassation for other courts). The supreme court collects such referrals and submits them to the Constitutional Council. If the Constitutional Council rules a law is unconstitutional, the law is struck down and no longer has legal force; this decision applies to everybody and not just the appelant in the case at hand.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.conseil-constitutionnel.fr/conseil-constitutionnel/root/bank_mm/anglais/en_ordinance_58_1067.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[European Court of Human Rights]] (ECtHR) has jurisdiction over claims of government violations in breach of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] in any ECHR member country, which includes all [[European Union|EU]] member countries. Before the ECtHR grants appeal, a claimant must have exhausted all available judicial recourse in the violating country; in France this means following the appeals process to either of the senior courts. Even so, the ECtHR has [[original jurisdiction]], not [[appellate jurisdiction]].

Additionally, French courts may petition the [[European Court of Justice]] to  [[European Court of Justice#References for a preliminary ruling|certify]] a question of law concerning [[European Union|EU]] law.

'''Direct Debit Dividend Contributions''' also known as '''3DC''' are payments made towards [[stockholder|shareholders]] for [[stock|shares]] which have been issued on credit.

Issuing stock on credit is considered appropriate when a [[Stakeholder (corporate)|Stakeholder]] (such as company's founder or other key person) wishes to retain involvement in a business but is unable to raise the capital required to pay for stock. In such circumstances the company's shareholders may agree to issue the desired level of stock against a plan where shares must be paid for through direct debit dividend contributions. '''3DC''' differs from [[Stock options]] in that the recipient is awarded shareholder status from the moment the 3DC arrangement is agreed.

'''3DC''' is often regarded as a reward for efforts achieved (usually for the groundwork required in setting up a new business). It also serves as an incentive to ensure future performance of the company's stock.

[[File:1904 Dog licence stamp.jpg|right|thumb|An Irish dog licence [[revenue stamp]] used in 1904 and showing an [[Irish Wolfhound]].]]
[[Image:DogTags license fxwb.jpg|right|thumb|The dog licence tag might be one of several [[Pet tag|dog tag]]s worn.]]
A '''dog licence''' is required in some jurisdictions to be the keeper of a [[dog]]. Usually a dog-licence identifying number is issued to the owner, along with a [[dog tag]] bearing the identifier and a contact number for the registering organization. If a stray pet is found with the tag, a rescuer can call the registering organization to get current contact information for the dog's owner.

Licensing a dog might require additional actions on the owner's part, such as ensuring that the dog has a current [[rabies]] [[vaccination]]. In many jurisdictions a fee, which is usually small, must be paid. Licences typically must be renewed annually or after some small number of years.

==Licensing information worldwide==
===Australia===
Dog licences are mandated by state and territory legislation but are issued by local governments (e.g., city or shire councils).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.caslon.com.au/registersnote3.htm#pets Australian Official Registers: Ownership and Use: pets] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110515013938/http://www.caslon.com.au/registersnote3.htm#pets |date=May 15, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence the cost of a licence and the format of the licence tag vary across the country. Some areas, such as Victoria, require cat registration and [[Microchip implant (animal)|microchipping]] also.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pets.info.vic.gov.au/community/cat_reg.htm All About Cats] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071027161454/http://www.pets.info.vic.gov.au/community/cat_reg.htm |date=October 27, 2007}} Responsible Pet Ownership Program, State Government of Victoria&lt;/ref&gt;

===[[Ireland]]===
Dog licences are required. There are three types of licences&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dog licensing in Ireland. Dog licences from An Post|url=http://www.anpost.ie/AnPost/GeneralTemplates/ProductsAndServices.aspx?NRMODE=Published&amp;NRNODEGUID={0CEF4EAB-DE73-4250-9876-69F955B3A83C}&amp;NRORIGINALURL=%2fAnPost%2fMainContent%2fPersonal%2bCustomers%2fMore%2bfrom%2bAn%2bPost%2fDog%2bLicence%2f&amp;NRCACHEHINT=Guest#Howmuch#Dog|publisher=An Post|accessdate=16 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:* Individual dog licence –  covers one dog for a period of 12 months
:* General  dog licence –  for owners of kennels for a period of 12 months
:* Lifetime of the dog licence –  for the lifetime of the dog for which the licence is issued

===Italy===
Since 2008 an identification microchip is mandatory for each dog over 2 months, and a small fee is associated with it, but it does not need to be renewed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Altalex|url=http://www.altalex.com/documents/leggi/2008/08/26/popolazione-canina-anagrafe-e-microchip-obbligatori}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Netherlands===
Dogs must be registered and a yearly tax is paid to the municipality based on the number of dogs. The amount differs between municipalities; for example in [[The Hague]] it is €112.80 for the first dog, €176.76 for the second one, and €224.16 for the third one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hondenbelasting|url=http://www.denhaag.nl/home/bewoners/loket/belastingen/to/Hondenbelasting.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other municipalities have scrapped it like Amsterdam in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hondenbelasting 2016|url=https://www.amsterdam.nl/veelgevraagd/?productid=%7B9B76E251-C7AF-4CE0-9118-0D1AFD5B3F75%7D}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New Zealand===
Under the [http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1996/0013/latest/DLM374410.html Dog Control Act 1996] all dogs over 3 months old are required to be registered with the [[Territorial authorities of New Zealand|city or district council]] the dog usually resides in. As a prerequisite, all dogs classified as dangerous or menacing, and all dogs first registered in New Zealand after 1 July 2006 must be microchipped before they can be registered.
:All dog registrations expire yearly on 30 June, and must be renewed by 31 July. Each registered dog must wear a tag specifying the council, registration expiry date, and registration number of the dog, with the colour of the tag changing every year for easy identification (e.g. tags for the 2013/14 year are red). Fees for registration differ between councils, and also differ according to factors such as whether the dog is neutered, living in an urban or rural area, classed as dangerous or menacing, and whether the owner is a responsible dog owner. Fees for working dogs (herding dogs, police dogs, drug dogs, etc.) are generally lower than for pets, and seeing-eye or hearing-ear dogs are generally free or minimal cost to register.

===United Kingdom===
In England, Wales and Scotland, dog licensing was abolished in 1987. Prior to this dog licences were mandatory, but the requirement was widely ignored, with only about half of owners having one. The final rate for a dog licence was 37 [[pence]], reduced from 37½p when the [[Halfpenny (British decimal coin)|halfpenny]] was withdrawn in 1984. This figure was an exact conversion from 7/6 (seven [[shilling]]s and [[Sixpence (British coin)|sixpence]]) on [[Decimal day|decimalisation]] in 1971. The revenue went to local authorities. In 2016 it became a requirement that all dogs in [[England and Wales]] have a microchip;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-21345730|title=Dog microchip date set for England|date=6 February 2013|publisher=|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scottish legislation was also changed to make microchipping of dogs compulsory from 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-31730726 |title=All Scottish dogs to be microchipped from next year|date=4 March 2015|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Northern Ireland]], dog licences are required under the Dogs (Northern Ireland) Order 1983. {{As of|2011|10}} dog licences cost £12.50 a year, with reductions for pensioners and owners of neutered dogs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-15143396 | work=BBC News | title=150% Increase In Price Of Dog Licence | date=3 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Crown dependencies====
;[[Bailiwick of Guernsey]]
Dog owners in Guernsey are required to obtain a licence for each dog owned and a dog tax is payable each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=GSPCA|url=http://www.gspca.org.gg/about/guernsey-dog-tax-law}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
At least some states, municipalities, and other jurisdictions require a dog license {{fact|date=June 2016}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cesarsway.com/get-involved/bringing-new-dog-home/5-reasons-to-get-your-dog-licensed|last1=Pajer|first1=Nicole|title=5 reasons to get your dog licensed|website=Cesar's Way|accessdate=16 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and rabies vaccination, and a license expires before the vaccine does. To prevent [[pet overpopulation|animal overpopulation]], some jurisdictions charge a lower licensing fee if the owner presents [[veterinarian|veterinary]] proof that the dog has been [[neutering|spayed or neutered]]. Some parts of California and Maryland require [[cat]] licenses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=PET LICENSING|url=http://animalcare.lacounty.gov/wps/portal/acc/programs/pet_licenses|publisher = Department of Animal Care &amp; Control, Los Angeles County|accessdate=27 Oct 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.co.ho.md.us/dilp/licensing/licenses_pets.htm Pet License] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090529152745/http://www.co.ho.md.us/dilp/licensing/licenses_pets.htm |date=May 29, 2009}} Department of Inspections/Licenses/Permits, Howard County Maryland Government&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Emer''' (Emmerich) '''de Vattel''' (25 April 1714 – 28 December 1767&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Vattel, Emeric de}}&lt;/ref&gt;) was an [[international law]]yer. He was born in Couvet in [[Canton of Neuchâtel|Neuchâtel]] (now [[Switzerland]]) in 1714 and died in 1767 of [[edema]]{{reference needed|date=November 2018}}.  He was largely influenced by Dutch jurist [[Hugo Grotius]]. He is most famous for his 1758 work ''[[The Law of Nations]]''. This work was his claim to fame and won him enough prestige to be appointed as a councilor to the court of [[Augustus III of Poland|Frederick Augustus II of Saxony]].

==The Law of Nations==
{{Main|The Law of Nations}}
[[File:Vattel - Le droit des gens, 1775 - 446.tiff|thumb|''Le droit des gens'', [[1775]].]]
[[Image:EmerichDeVattel-LawOfNation.png|thumb|right|The cover page from ''The Law of Nations'']]
Vattel's masterpiece was largely influenced by a book titled ''Jus Gentium Methodo Scientifica Pertractum'' (The Law of Nations According to the Scientific Method) by [[Christian Wolff (philosopher)|Christian Wolff]]. Vattel's work began, in fact, by translating Wolff's text from Latin, and adding his own thoughts. Vattel's work was also heavily influenced by [[Gottfried Leibniz]] and [[Hugo Grotius]]. Focused largely on the rights and obligations of citizens and states, Vattel's work also had ramifications for [[Just War|Just War Theory]] as it outlined international diplomacy as we now know it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Barbarians at the Gates|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/02/17/books/barbarians-at-the-gates.html|date=17 February 2002|first=Michael|last=Ignatieff|authorlink=Michael Ignatieff|work=[[The New York Times]]|postscript=|accessdate=4 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vattel elucidated the "Golden Rule of Sovereigns":

&lt;blockquote&gt;One cannot complain when he is treated as he treats others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
===English editions===
Vattel’s ''Law of Nations'' was translated into English in 1760, based on the French original of 1758.  A Dublin translation of 1787 does not include notes from the original nor posthumous notes added to the 1773 French edition. Several other English editions were based on the edition of 1760. However, an English edition from 1793 includes Vattel’s later thoughts, as did the London 1797 edition. The 1797 edition has a detailed table of contents and margin titles for subsections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

===Benjamin Franklin===
[[Charles W.F. Dumas]] sent [[Benjamin Franklin]] three original French copies of de Vattel's ''Le droit des gens'' (''The Law of Nations''). Franklin presented one copy to the [[Library Company of Philadelphia]]. On December 9, 1775, Franklin thanked Dumas:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It came to us in good season, when the circumstances of a rising State make it necessary to frequently consult the Law of Nations.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Franklin also said that this book by Vattel, "has been continually in the hands of the members of our Congress now sitting".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

===George Washington===
Two notable copies of ''The Law of Nations'' owned by the [[New York Society Library]] have been associated with [[US President]] [[George Washington]]. One copy had been borrowed by Washington on 8 October 1789, along with a copy of Vol. 12 of the ''Commons Debates'', containing transcripts from [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]]'s [[House of Commons of Great Britain|House of Commons]]. When the staff of the  Washington museum at [[Mount Vernon]] heard about the overdue books, they were unable to locate them, but purchased a second copy of the de Vattel work for [[US$]]12,000. This identical copy was ceremoniously "returned" 221 years late on 20 May 2010. The library waived the unpaid late-fees.&lt;ref&gt;[http://theweek.com/article/index/203282/george-washingtons-221-year-overdue-library-book-a-timeline "George Washington's 221-year overdue library book: A timeline"], [[The Week]], 21 May 2010, retrieved 3 May 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other works==
Vattel also published works other than his ''magnum opus''.  His last work was written in 1762 and concerned Wolff's [[natural law]] philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/questionsdedroit00vatt ''Questions de droit naturel, et observations sur le Traité du droit de la nature de M. le baron de Wolf'',  A Berne : Chez la Societé typographique (1762)] [[Internet Archive]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence==
Vattel was one of a number of 18th century European scholars who wrote on [[international law]] and were "well known in America" at the time, including [[Jean-Jacques Burlamaqui]], [[Cornelius van Bynkershoek]], [[Hugo Grotius]], [[Samuel von Pufendorf]], [[Thomas Rutherforth]], [[Niccolo Machiavelli]], and Wolff. ''The Law of Nations'' has been described as "unrivaled among such treatises in its influence on the American founders".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.state.gov/secretary/rm/2011/07/169371.htm U.S. Department of State: [[Hillary Clinton]], Secretary of State: ''America’s Founders were inspired by the ideas and values of early Swiss philosophers like Jean-Jacques Burlamaqui and Emer de Vattel, and the 1848 Swiss Constitution was influenced by our own U.S. Constitution. Swiss commitment to democracy is an example for nations and people everywhere who yearn for greater freedoms and human rights'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Law of Nations as a Constitutional Obligation|url=http://www.law.georgetown.edu/internationalhrcolloquium/documents/RamseyPaper.doc|date=14 October 2005|first=Michael D.|last=Ramsey|work=''[http://www.law.georgetown.edu/internationalhrcolloquium/archive.htm International Human Rights Colloquium]''|publisher=[[Georgetown University Law Center]]|format=[[MS Word]] [[DOC (computing)|document]]|postscript=|accessdate=4 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vattel is also cited extensively in [[Lysander Spooner|Lysander Spooner's]] ''The Unconstitutionality Of Slavery'' and appears to be a key Enlightenment thinker in Spooner's thought.

== US Department of Defense 2015 Law of War Manual==

In 2015 the United States Department of Defense published its Law of War Manual. Vattel is cited after [[Hugo Grotius]] and before [[Francis Lieber]] and [[Hersch Lauterpacht]] as a subsidiary means and an authority in determining the rules of [[law of war]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Office of General Counsel, Department of Defense |first= |author-link=|year=2016 |editor-last= |editor-first= |contribution= |title=Department of Defense Law War Manual |edition= 2nd |publisher=  |publication-date= |publication-place=Washington, DC|pages=35 |url=http://www.dtic.mil/docs/citations/AD1014128|accessdate=16 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Civil procedure (United States)}}
The '''Federal Interpleader Act of 1936'''  {{usstat|49|1096}} was [[United States]] federal legislation enacted by the [[74th United States Congress]] approved January 20, 1936.

==History ==
The Act repealed and replaced the existing federal interpleader act {{usstat|44|416}} approved May 8, 1926 and codified it as [[Judicial Code of 1911|United States Judicial Code]] §41(26), and established the modern [[Interpleader#Statutory Interpleader|statutory interpleader]]. The act was drafted by [[Zechariah Chafee]], who considered this his foremost professional accomplishment.&lt;ref&gt;West's Encyclopedia of American Law, edition 2 [http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Zechariah+Chafee Zehariah Chafee] Copyright 2008 The Gale Group, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;
The Federal Interpleader Act was enacted to overcome the ruling of the [[United States Supreme Court]] in [[New York Life v. Dunlevy]] {{ussc|241|518}}, that for a party to be bound by an interpleader that party must be served process in a way that obtains [[personal jurisdiction]] by enabling nationwide [[service of process]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cleary | first1 = James T.| title = Federal Interpleader and Some Recent Cases| journal = Georgetown Law Journal| volume = 26 | pages = 1017| url = http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?collection=journals&amp;handle=hein.journals/glj26&amp;div=70&amp;id=&amp;page=
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original act [[Federal Interpleader Act of 1917]] allowed an [[insurance company]], or [[Friendly society|fraternal benefit society]] subject to multiple claims on the same [[Insurance policy|policy]] to file a suit in [[equity (law)|equity]] by a bill of [[interpleader]] in [[United States District Courts]] and providing nationwide [[service of process]]. The policy must have a value of at least $500 is claimed or may be claimed by adverse claimants; which is less than the [[amount in controversy]] of $3,000 in Judicial Code §48(1) then required for general [[diversity jurisdiction]]. Two or more of the beneficiaries must live in different states.

The 1917 act was amended in 1925 by {{usstat|43|973}} approved February 25, 1925. This element of [[Civil procedure in the United States|civil procedure]] was subsequently in 1926 was repealed and replaced by, {{usstat|44|416}} approved May 8, 1926, which added  to those who can bring suit [[Casualty insurance|casualty]] company and [[surety]] company, empowered the court to enjoin claimant from proceeding in any state or other federal court on the same liability, adding provisions as to the proper venue for the interpleader in certain cases but required that there must be actual claims by eliminating the words "may claim" that were in the 1917 act.

When the United States Judicial Code was enacted into [[United States Code]] as [[positive law]] in 1948, {{usstat|62|931}} approved June 25, 1948, it was reconstituted as {{UnitedStatesCode|28|1335}}, {{usc|28|1397|pipe=1397}}, and {{usc|28|2361|pipe=2361}}.

'''''Ferko, et al. v. National Association for Stock Car Auto Racing, Inc., et al.''''', commonly known as the '''Ferko lawsuit''', was an [[United States|American]] lawsuit between plaintiff Francis Ferko, a resident of [[Plano, Texas]] and a minor shareholder of the publicly traded [[Speedway Motorsports, Inc.]] (SMI), and defendants [[NASCAR]] and [[International Speedway Corporation]] (ISC), which are both owned by the [[France family]].  Ferko, a racing fan not associated with the executive management team of SMI, contended that the defendants violated [[antitrust]] laws in preventing SMI's [[Texas Motor Speedway]] from obtaining a promised second NASCAR [[NEXTEL Cup]] race per racing season.&lt;ref name="Fan"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dfw.com/mld/dfw/13059399.htm |title=Fan wishes he hadn't filed suit |work=Dallas-Fort Worth Star-Telegram |accessdate=2006-12-28 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060708031401/http://www.thatsracin.com/mld/thatsracin/13059399.htm |archivedate=2006-07-08 |last=Wilson |first=Jeff}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The suit was filed in February 2002, and was settled out of court in May 2004.&lt;ref name="Fan"/&gt;  The settlement delivered a second Sprint Cup race each season to the track, but also resulted in numerous other changes to the NASCAR schedule of races and racing venues.&lt;ref name=Settlement&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sportsbusinessdaily.com/article/85164 |title=Ferko Lawsuit Settled As Texas And Phoenix Gain Cup Races|publisher=Street and Smith's SportsBusiness Daily|date=May 14, 2004|accessdate=2009-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Settlement==
As the case was preparing to go to trial in 2004, the parties settled the lawsuit as part of a larger restructuring of NASCAR's schedule.&lt;ref name="Fan"/&gt;  In the settlement, ISC sold the [[North Carolina Speedway]] in [[Rockingham, North Carolina|Rockingham]] (now known as [[Rockingham Speedway]]) to Speedway Motorsports, but Rockingham's one NEXTEL Cup race (which had been held in February) was moved to ISC's [[Auto Club Speedway]] in [[Fontana, California]].  Continuing with NASCAR's schedule realignment, Texas earned its promised second race (the reason for the lawsuit) when a November race, used for the prestigious [[Southern 500]] (renamed the Dickies 500 in Texas), was moved to Texas from ISC's [[Darlington Raceway]]. As it happens, the November date had been inherited by Darlington from Rockingham only a year earlier, when Rockingham had been reduced from two NEXTEL Cup races to one.  The November date gave Texas a race in the [[Chase for the Sprint Cup|Chase for the Nextel Cup]] and cost Darlington the more prestigious of its two race dates.&lt;ref name=Settlement/&gt;  For its part, SMI had to agree that Rockingham would be used only for non-competition NASCAR uses, such as for movie settings about the sport or for testing.&lt;ref name="Fan"/&gt;  As a result of a 2006 NASCAR testing rule change limiting testing on tracks used for NASCAR competition, testing at Rockingham has become more commonplace.  SMI sold off the Rockingham track in 2007. 

==Personal fallout==
Ferko's life fell apart as a direct result of the lawsuit.  In 2002, he lost his job in food safety, because his boss disliked the publicity that Ferko received, and he and his wife were forced to move to [[Atlanta]] for his new job.  Shortly after moving, their 20-year-old son Anthony, who remained in Texas to be with his own 6-month-old son, committed [[suicide]], which Ferko believes may have been avoided if they had stayed in Texas with him.&lt;ref name="Fan"/&gt;  After Ferko and his wife failed to win custody of their grandson, they [[divorce]]d.

The management team of SMI never rewarded Ferko, a fan and minor shareholder, for winning them a race slot worth millions of dollars.  In 2005, before the [[2005 Dickies 500|initial running]] of the [[AAA Texas 500|Dickies 500]], Ferko expressed his disappointment in SMI not asking him to wave the green flag at the race, and said that "[k]nowing what I know now, I definitely would not have pursued [the lawsuit].... I never expected those kinds of unintended consequences to occur."&lt;ref name="Fan" /&gt;

==Related litigation==
In 2005, [[Kentucky Speedway]] filed a similar suit against NASCAR and ISC, requesting a NEXTEL Cup race at their venue.  However, unlike the promise of a second race at the heart of the Ferko lawsuit, the France family had expressly told Kentucky Speedway that it would not be given even one race, and so the case was filed on antitrust grounds only.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reviewjournal.com/lvrj_home/2006/Mar-12-Sun-2006/news/6185407.html |title=Litigation on track causes caution flag|author=Jeff Wolf|publisher=''[[Las Vegas Review-Journal]]''|date=March 12, 2006|accessdate=2009-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The lawsuit was dismissed on January 7, 2008, although the track's owners appealed the dismissal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kentuckyspeedway.com/newsline/news.asp?sid=667|title=Kentucky Speedway to Appeal Antitrust Lawsuit Decision|publisher=[[Kentucky Speedway]]|date=January 7, 2008|accessdate=2009-06-01}} {{Dead link|date=November 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On May 22, 2008, Speedway Motorsports, Inc. announced it had purchased Kentucky Speedway from Kentucky Speedway, LLC and further litigation became [[mootness|moot]] as a result. The purchase was finalized on January 1, 2009. Bruton Smith, head of Speedway Motorsports Inc. who bought the racetrack, said he had plans to bring a Sprint Cup race to Kentucky Speedway. That came in 2011 when Kentucky Speedway gained a [[Quaker State 400|date]] at the expense of [[Atlanta Motor Speedway]], its sister track.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Graves|first=Will|url=http://www.kentucky.com/2010/08/02/1372812/report-kentucky-speedwaygetting.html|title=Report: Kentucky Speedway getting Sprint Cup race|newspaper=[[Lexington Herald-Leader]]|date=August 2, 2010|accessdate=2013-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Judaism|Jewish tradition]] the '''Great Assembly''' ({{lang-he-n|כְּנֶסֶת הַגְּדוֹלָה}}) or '''Anshei Knesset HaGedolah''' ({{Hebrew|אַנְשֵׁי כְּנֶסֶת הַגְּדוֹלָה}}, "The Men of the Great Assembly"), also known as the '''Great Synagogue''', or ''Synod'', was an assembly of 120 scribes, sages, and prophets, in the period from the end of the Biblical prophets since the early [[Second Temple period]] to the early [[Hellenistic period]]. It comprised such prophets as Haggai, Zechariah, Malachi (who is Ezra), Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, Azariah, Nehemiah b. Hachaliah, Mordechai and Zerubabel b. Shaaltiel, among others.&lt;ref&gt;Maimonides' Introduction to his Mishnah Commentary (ed. Nehemiah Shmuel Rot), Jerusalem 2005, p. 59 (Hebrew)&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes, the Great Assembly is simply designated as "Ezra and his court of law" (''Beit Din'').&lt;ref&gt;Maimonides' Introduction to his Code of Jewish Law (Mishne Torah).&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the developments in Judaism that are attributed to them are the fixing of the Jewish [[Biblical canon]], including the [[Book of Ezekiel]], [[Book of Daniel|Daniel]], [[Book of Esther|Esther]], and the [[Twelve Minor Prophets]]; the introduction of the Feast of [[Purim]]; and the institution of the prayer known as the "[[Amidah|Shemoneh 'Esreh]]" as well as the synagogal prayers, rituals, and benedictions.

Some modern scholars question whether the Great Assembly ever existed as an institution as such. [[Louis Jacobs]], while not endorsing this view, remarks that "references in the [later] Rabbinic literature to the Men of the Great Synagogue can be taken to mean that ideas, rules, and prayers, seen to be pre-Rabbinic but post-biblical, were often fathered upon them".&lt;ref&gt;[[Louis Jacobs]] (1995), [https://books.google.com/books?id=l1u-_VMDM80C&amp;pg=PA201 Great Synagogue, Men of], in ''The Jewish religion: a companion'', p. 201.  Oxford: Oxford University Press.  {{ISBN|0-19-826463-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Inclusion of the last Hebrew Bible prophets==
The members of the Great Assembly are designated in the [[Mishnah]] (Ab. i. 1) as those who occupied a place in the chain of tradition between the [[Prophet]]s and the [[Tanaim|earliest scholars known by name]].

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Prophets transmitted the Torah to the men of the Great Synagogue. . . . [[Simon the Just]] was one of those who survived the Great Synagogue, and Antigonus of Soko received the Torah from him. (Ab. i. 1 et seq.).&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The first part of this statement is paraphrased as follows in Ab. R. N. i.;

&lt;blockquote&gt;[[Haggai]], [[Zechariah (Hebrew prophet)|Zechariah]], and [[Malachi]] received from the Prophets; and the men of the Great Synagogue received from Haggai, Zechariah, and Malachi.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In this paraphrase the three post-[[Babylonian captivity|exilic]] prophets are separated from the other prophets, for it was the task of the former to transmit the Law to the members of the Great Synagogue. It must even be assumed that these three prophets were themselves included in those members, for it is evident from the statements referring to the institution of the [[Jewish services|prayers]] and benedictions that the Great Synagogue included prophets.

According to R. Johanan, who wrote in the third century, 
&lt;blockquote&gt;The men of the Great Synagogue instituted for Israel the benedictions and the prayers, as well as the benedictions for [[Kiddush]] and habdalah (Ber. 33a).&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This agrees with the sentence of R. Jeremiah (fourth century), who states (Yer. Ber. 4d), in reference to the "[[Amidah|Shemoneh 'Esreh]]," that

&lt;blockquote&gt;one hundred and twenty elders, including about eighty prophets, have instituted these prayers.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

These one hundred and twenty elders are undoubtedly identical with the men of the Great Synagogue. The number given of the prophets must, however, be corrected according to Meg. 17b, where the source of R. Jeremiah's statement is found:

&lt;blockquote&gt;R. Johanan said that, according to some, a baraita taught that one hundred and twenty elders, including some prophets, instituted the 'Shemoneh 'Esreh.'&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Hence the prophets were in a minority in the Great Synagogue.

Another statement regarding the activity of this institution alludes to the establishment of the Feast of [[Purim]] according to Esth. ix. 27 et seq., while the [[Babylonian Talmud]] (Meg. 2a) states, as a matter requiring no discussion, that the celebration of the Feast of Purim on the days mentioned in Meg. i. 1 was instituted by the men of the Great Synagogue. But in the [[Jerusalem Talmud]], R. Johanan (Meg. 70d; Ruth R. ii. 4) speaks of ''eighty-five elders, among them about thirty prophets.''

===Number===
These divergent statements may easily be reconciled (see Krochmal, "Moreh Nebuke ha-Zeman," p.&amp;nbsp;97) by reading, in the one passage, "beside them" instead of "among them" ; and in the other passage, "thirty" instead of "eighty."

The number eighty-five is taken from Neh. 10:2–29; but the origin of the entire number (120) is not known. It was undoubtedly assumed that the company of those mentioned in Neh. 10. was increased to one hundred and twenty by the prophets who took part in the sealing of the covenant, this view, which is confirmed by Neh. 7:7, 14, being based on the hypothesis that other prophets besides Haggai, Zechariah, and Malachi were then preaching in Israel. These passages indicate that this assembly was believed to be the one described in Neh. 9–10, and other statements regarding it prove that the [[Amoraim]] accepted this identification as a matter of course.

According to Abba b. Kahana, the well-known [[Aggadah|haggadist]] of the latter half of the third century (Shem-Tob on Ps. 36, end):

&lt;blockquote&gt;Two generations used the '[[Tetragrammaton|Shem ha-Meforesh]],' the men of the Great Synagogue and the generation of the '[[Apostasy|shemad]]' (the persecution of [[Hadrian]] and the [[Bar Kokba revolt]]).&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This reference is explained in a statement by Giddel, a pupil of Rab (Yer. Meg. iii., end; Yoma 69b):
&lt;blockquote&gt;The word in Neh. 8:6 indicates that Ezra uttered the great Tetragram in his praise of God.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Generation of Ezra==
The combination of these two passages, which evidently have the same basis, offers another instance of the general assumption that all the members of this body were regarded as belonging to one generation, which included Ezra, while Joshua b. Levi, one of the earliest amoraim, even derived the term "Great Synagogue" from Neh. 9:32. The authors of the prayers restored the triad of the divine attributes introduced by Moses (Deut. 10:17), although Jeremiah (32:18) and Daniel (9:4) had each omitted one of the three attributes from their prayers. "The Great Assembly was so called because it gave the divine attributes their ancient 'greatness' and dignity" (Yoma 69b [with other authorities]; Yer. Ber. 11c and Meg. 74c; Shem-Ṭob on Ps. 19; see also Ber. 33b); although this is merely a haggadic explanation of the old term, it indicates that the Amoraim did not think the Great Synagogue could be any other assembly or council than the one mentioned as the source of the prayers in Neh. ix.; and there are other examples in traditional literature evidencing this view. In Yer. Ber. 3a (Gen. R. 46, 78.) this objection is raised in regard to a thesis of R. Levi based on Gen. 17:5 and referring to Neh. 9:7: "Did not the men of the Great Synagogue call Abraham by his former name, Abram?" In the name of the men of the Great Synagogue, R. Abbahu (Gen. R. vi.) quotes the words "The heaven of heavens, with all their host" (Neh. 9:6) as an explanation of Gen. 1:17; and the same authority is invoked in a haggadic passage by Abin (Tan., Shemot, i.) in reference to Neh. 9:5 (ib. 2, anonymous), as well as in one by Samuel b. Naḥman (Ex. R. xli., beginning; Tan., Ki Tissa, 14) alluding to Neh. 9:18.

R. Johanan connected the following story with Neh. 10:1–2 (Ruth R. 2:4): "The men of the Great Synagogue wrote a document in which they voluntarily agreed to pay heave-offerings and tithes. This document they displayed in the hall of the Temple; the following morning they found the divine confirmation inscribed upon it." Since Nehemiah himself was a member, Samuel b. Marta, a pupil of Rab, quoted a phrase used by Nehemiah in his prayer (1:7) as originating with his colleagues (Ex. R. 41; Tan., Peḳude, beginning). Ezra was, of course, one of the members, and, according to Neh. 8, he was even regarded as the leader. In one of the two versions of the interpretation of Cant. 7:14 (Lev. R. 2:11), therefore, Ezra and his companions ("'Ezra wa-ḥaburato") are mentioned, while the other version (Cant. R. ad loc.) speaks merely of the "men of the Great Synagogue" (compare the statements made above regarding the pronunciation of the Tetragram). In the targum to Cant. 7:3, in addition to "Ezra the priest" the men mentioned in Ezra 2:2 as the leaders of the people returning from the Exile—Zerubbabel, Jeshua, Nehemiah, Mordecai, and Bilshan—are designated as "men of the Great Synagogue." In the same targum (to 6:4) the leaders of the exiles are called the "sages of the Great Synagogue."

It appears from all these passages in traditional literature that the idea of the Great Assembly was based on the narrative in Neh. 8–10, and that, furthermore, its members were regarded as the leaders of Israel who had returned from exile and laid the foundations of the new polity connected with the Second Temple. All these men were regarded in the tannaitic chronology as belonging to one generation; for this reason the "generation of the men of the Great Synagogue" is mentioned in one of the passages already cited, this denoting, according to the chronological canon of Jose b. Ḥalafta ([[Seder 'Olam Rabbah]] xxx. [ed. Ratner], p.&amp;nbsp;141); 'Ab. Zarah 86), the generation of thirty-four years during which the Persian rule lasted, at the beginning of the period of the Second Temple. As the last prophets were still preaching during this time, they also were included. That prophecy began only at the end of this period, when the reign of Alexander the Great commenced, was likewise a thesis of the tannaitic chronology, which, like the canon of the thirty-four years, was adopted by the later Jewish chronologists ([[Seder 'Olam Rabbah]] l.c.; comp. Sanh. 11a), although the view occurs as early as Josephus ("[[Contra Apionem|Contra Ap.]]" i., § 8).

==Position in Tannaitic chronology==
In view of these facts, it was natural that the Great Synagogue should be regarded as the connecting-link in the chain of tradition between the Prophets and the scholars. It may easily be seen, therefore, why [[Simeon the Just]] should be termed a survivor of this body, for, according to the tradition current in the circle of scholars, it was this high priest, and not his grandfather Jaddua, who met Alexander the Great, and received from him much honor (see Yoma 69a; Meg. Ta'an. for the 21st of Kislew; comp. Alexander the Great).

It is thus evident that, according to the only authority extant in regard to the subject, the tradition of the Tannaim and the Amoraim, the activity of this assembly was confined to the period of the Persian rule, and thus to the first thirty-four years of the Second Temple, and that afterward, when Simon the Just was its only survivor, there was no other fixed institution which could be regarded as a precursor of the academies. This statement does not imply, however, that such a body did not exist in the first centuries of the Second Temple, for it must be assumed that some governing council existed in those centuries as well, although the statements regarding the Great Synagogue refer exclusively to the first period. The term primarily denoted the assembly described in Neh. 9–10, which convened principally for religious purposes—fasting, reading of the Torah, confession of sins, and prayer (Neh. 9:1 et seq.). Since every gathering convened for religious purposes was called "keneset" (hence "bet ha-keneset" = "the synagogue"; comp. the verb "kenos," Esth. 4:16), this term was applied also to the assembly in question; but as it was an assembly of special importance it was designated more specifically as the "great assembly" (comp. Neh. 5:7, "ḳehillah gedolah").

In addition to fixing the ritual observances for the first two quarters of the day (Neh. 9:3), the Great Synagogue engaged in legislative proceedings, making laws as summarized in Neh. 10:30 et seq. Tradition therefore ascribed to it the character of a chief magistracy, and its members, or rather its leaders, including the prophets of that time, were regarded as the authors of other obligatory rules. These leaders of post-exilic Israel in the Persian period were called the "men of the Great Synagogue" because it was generally assumed that all those who then acted as leaders had been members of the memorable gathering held on the 24th of Tishri, 444 BC. Although the assembly itself convened only on a single day, its leaders were designated in tradition as regular members of the Great Synagogue. This explains the fact that the references speak almost exclusively of the members of the Great Synagogue, the allusions to the body itself being very rare, and based in part on error, as, for example, the quotation from Ab. 1:2 which occurs in Eccl. R. 12:11.

As certain institutions supposed to have been established in the first period of the Second Temple were ascribed to Ezra, so others of them were ascribed to the men of the Great Synagogue. There is, in fact, no difference between the two classes of institutions so far as origin is concerned. In some cases Ezra, the great scribe and the leader of the Great Synagogue, is mentioned as the author, in others the entire body is so mentioned; in all cases the body with Ezra at its head must be thought of as the real authors. In traditional literature, however, a distinction was generally drawn between the institutions of Ezra and those of the men of the Great Synagogue, so that they figured separately; but it is not surprising, after what has been said above, that in Tan., Beshallaḥ, 16, on Ex. 15:7, the "Tiḳḳune Soferim," called also ("Okhla we-Okhla," No. 168) "Tiḳḳune 'Ezra" (emendations of the text of the Bible by the Soferim, or by Ezra; and according to the tannaitic source [see Bacher, "Ag. Tan." ii. 205], originally textual euphemisms), should be ascribed to the men of the Great Synagogue, since the author of the passage in question identified the Soferim (i.e., Ezra and his successors) with them.

==Institutions and rulings==
The following rulings were ascribed to the men of the Great Synagogue:

#They included the books of Ezekiel, Daniel, Esther, and the Twelve Minor Prophets in the Biblical canon; this is the only possible explanation of the baraita (B. B. 15a) that they "wrote" those books. The first three books, which were composed outside Israel, had to be accepted by the men of the Great Synagogue before they could be regarded as worthy of inclusion, while the division of the Minor Prophets was completed by the works of the three post-exilic prophets, who were themselves members of that council. The same activity in regard to these books is ascribed to the men of the Great Synagogue as had been attributed to King Hezekiah and his council, including the prophet Isaiah, with regard to the three books ascribed to Solomon (see also Ab. R. N. i.) and the Book of Isaiah. In this baraita, as well as in the gloss upon it, Ezra and Nehemiah, "men of the Great Synagogue," are mentioned as the last Biblical writers; while according to the introduction to the Second Book of the Maccabees (ii. 13) Nehemiah also collected a number of the books of the Bible.
#They introduced the triple classification of the oral law, dividing the study of the Mishnah (in the larger sense) into the three branches of midrash, halakot, and aggadot, although this view, which is anonymous, conflicted with that of R. Jonah, an amora of the fourth century, who declared that the founder of this threefold division of traditional science (see Jew. Encyc. iii. 163, s.v. Bible Exegesis) was R. Akiba (Yer. Sheḳ. v., beginning). This view is noteworthy as showing that the later representatives of tradition traced the origin of their science to the earliest authorities, the immediate successors of the Prophets. The men of the Great Synagogue, therefore, not only completed the canon, but introduced the scientific treatment of tradition.
#They introduced the Feast of Purim and determined the days on which it should be celebrated (see above).
#They instituted the "Shemoneh 'Esreh," as well as the benedictions and other prayers, as already noted. The tradition in regard to this point expresses the view that the synagogal prayers as well as the entire ritual were put into definite shape by the men of the Great Synagogue.

==Other activity==
The list of Biblical personages who have no part in the future world (Sanh. x. 1) was made, according to Rab, by the men of the Great Synagogue (Sanh. 104b), and an aggadic ruling on Biblical stories beginning with the phrase "Va-yehi bayamim" (And it came to pass in those days) is designated by Johanan, or his pupil Levi, as a "tradition of the men of the Great Synagogue" (Meg. 10b). This is merely another way of saying, as is stated elsewhere (Lev. R. xi.) in reference to the same ruling, that it had been brought as a tradition from the Babylonian exile. There are references also to other aggadic traditions of this kind (see Bacher, "Ag. Tan." 2d ed., i. 192; idem, "Die Aelteste Terminologie," p.&amp;nbsp;107). Joshua b. Levi ascribes in an original way to the men of the Great Synagogue the merit of having provided for all time for the making of copies of the Bible, tefillin, and mezuzot, stating that they instituted twenty-four fasts to ensure that wealth would not be acquired by copyists, who would cease to copy if they became rich (Pes. 50b). A aggadic passage by Jose b. Ḥanina refers to the names of the returning exiles mentioned in Ezra ii. 51 et seq. (Gen. R. lxxi. et passim), one version reading "the men of the Great Synagogue" instead of "sons of the Exile," or "those that returned from the Exile" ("'ole goleh"). This shows that the men of the Great Synagogue included the first generation of the Second Temple. In Esth. R. iii. 7 the congregation of the tribes mentioned in Judges xx. 1 is apparently termed "men of the Great Synagogue." This is due, however, to a corruption of the text, for, according to Luria's skilful emendation, this phrase must be read with the preceding words "Ezra and the men of the Great Synagogue"; so that the phrase corresponds to the "bene ha-golah" of Ezra x. 16.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}

There is, finally, a passage of three clauses, which the Mishnah (Ab. i. 12) ascribes to the men of the Great Synagogue as stated above, and which reads as follows: "Be heedful in pronouncing sentence; have many pupils; put a fence about the Torah." This aphorism, ascribed to an entire body of men, can only be interpreted as expressing their spirit and tendency, yet it must have been formulated by some individual, probably one of their number. At all events, it may be regarded as a historical and authentic statement of the dominating thought of those early leaders of post-exilic Israel who were designated in the tradition of the local schools as the men of the Great Synagogue. It must also be noted that this passage, like the majority of those given in the first chapter of Abot, is addressed to the teachers and spiritual leaders rather than to the people. These three clauses indicate the program of the scholars of the Persian period, who were regarded as one generation, and evidence their harmony with the spirit of Ezra's teaching. Their program was carried out by the Pharisees: caution in pronouncing legal sentences; watchfulness over the schools and the training of pupils; assurance of the observance of the Law by the enforcement of protective measures and rulings.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}

An attempt has thus been made to assign correct positions to the texts in which the men of the Great Synagogue are mentioned, and to present the views on which they are based, although no discussions can be broached regarding the views of the chroniclers and historians, or the different hypotheses and conclusions drawn from these texts concerning the history of the period of the Second Temple. For this a reference to the articles cited in the bibliography must suffice. Kuenen especially presents a good summary of the more recent theories, while L. Löw (who is not mentioned by Kuenen) expresses views totally divergent from those generally held with regard to the Great Synagogue; this body he takes to be the assembly described in I Macc. xiv. 25-26, which made Simeon the Hasmonean a hereditary prince (18th of Elul, 140 BC)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Die Grosse Synode (from Ben Chananja, vol. i), in Gesammelte Schriften|last=Löw|first=Leopold|publisher=|year=1885|isbn=|location=Hildesheim ; New York ; Olms|pages=399-449}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1052">In '''''Henriques v Giles''''', an important case in the South African law of succession, a husband and wife had instructed their accountant to prepare each of their respective wills. The content of each of the wills varied considerably. The husband accidentally signed his wife’s will; his wife accidentally signed his will.

The husband died in 2004, and his wife the following year.

In response to a request to rectify both wills, the court held that the husband’s will was capable of being rectified, but the wife’s will was not, as the court was not satisfied that she had the requisite capacity to execute a will due to her affliction with Alzheimer’s syndrome.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11964">'''Articolo 18-bis Legge 91/1981''' (Article 18B of Law no. 91 of 1981) also known as '''Salva Calcio''' (Save Football) is an Italian law introduced in 2003&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.corriere.it/Primo_Piano/Politica/2003/08_Agosto/19/decreto.shtml|title=Approvato il decreto salva-calcio|date=19 August 2003|access-date=21 August 2017|work=Corriere della Sera|language=Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt; by Law N°27/2003, itself ratified the decree-law N°282/2002 issued by the Prime Minister [[Silvio Berlusconi]] (owner of [[A.C. Milan]]). The law allows football clubs to defer the [[amortization]] expense of intangible assets (player contracts) into 10 equal annual installments. Generally speaking, transfer fees paid to other clubs were capitalized as intangible assets. In accounting, tangible assets were depreciated and intangible assets amortized. At that time, Italian clubs had broken the world transfer record several times. Most clubs relied on player profit as a revenue source, with cash-plus-player deals the most popular method of increasing profit. For example, Juventus signed [[Gianluigi Buffon]] and [[Lilian Thuram]] for a total of 180&amp;nbsp;billion lire (€92.96&amp;nbsp;million). However, Parma also received [[Jonathan Bachini]] for an undisclosed fee and Juventus earned €10&amp;nbsp;million on Bachini.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.juventus.com/wps/wcm/connect/7665be8a-c95d-406e-91db-4de08d142c0c/28_ott_2002_eng_.pdf?MOD%3DAJPERES%26CACHEID%3D7665be8a-c95d-406e-91db-4de08d142c0c |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-05-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150607132859/http://www.juventus.com/wps/wcm/connect/7665be8a-c95d-406e-91db-4de08d142c0c/28_ott_2002_eng_.pdf?MOD=AJPERES&amp;CACHEID=7665be8a-c95d-406e-91db-4de08d142c0c |archivedate=2015-06-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some cases high-priced player trades were used to increase short-term profit, stressing future budgets. [[Vratislav Greško]], who was signed for one year by [[F.C. Internazionale Milano|Internazionale]] for [[Deutsche Mark|DM]]9.5&amp;nbsp;million (€4.857&amp;nbsp;million), was sold to Parma in 2002 for €16&amp;nbsp;million; [[Matías Almeyda]], who joined Parma with [[Hernán Crespo]], also sold from Parma to Inter for €16&amp;nbsp;million. Both Greško and Almeyda left the club after one and two years, respectively, for an undisclosed fee and free transfer. A similar situation occurred in Parma and Rome in 2001; [[Amedeo Mangone|Mangone]], [[Paolo Poggi|Poggi]] and [[Sergei Gurenko|Gurenko]] were priced at a total of [[Italian lira|₤]]65&amp;nbsp;billion (€33,569,698) in a trade with [[Diego Fuser|Fuser]], [[Raffaele Longo|Longo]] and [[Saliou Lassissi|Lassissi]]. However, Fuser played only briefly for Rome and Gurenko only briefly for Parma. Rome also traded with other clubs in June 2002 (the end of the 2001–02 financial year), including [[Luigi Sartor]] (€9.5&amp;nbsp;million) for [[Sebastiano Siviglia]] (€9&amp;nbsp;million).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/2002/novembre/07/Roma_buco_nel_bilancio_Per_co_0_0211077824.shtml|title=La Roma ha un buco nel bilancio?

After the establishment of the amortization fund, amortization was lower in general.&lt;ref name=Morrow/&gt; After the players became free agents, their deferred value was still counted as assets; this was unacceptable by [[International Financial Reporting Standards]] (IFRS) or Italian standards.&lt;ref name=rdes/&gt; The deferment was borrowing future income.

*'''Note:''' Changes in amortization may also be due to investment of player assets or player contract extensions; the amortization time frame may also affect its amount.

It was reported that 15 clubs had set-up such special amortization fund,&lt;ref name=Morrow/&gt; for example [[A.S. Roma]], [[A.C. Milan]] and [[F.C. Internazionale Milano]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.iltempo.it/sport/2003/09/09/news/cos-e-il-decreto-salva-calcio-181170/|title=COS'È IL DECRETO SALVA-CALCIO|date=9 September 2003|access-date=21 August 2017|work=Il Tempo|language=Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Aftermath ==
The [[European Union]] rejected the law in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.repubblica.it/2003/k/sezioni/sport/calcio/montiboccia/montiboccia/montiboccia.html|title=Ue, bocciato il decreto salva calcio Molte società a rischio fallimento|date=1 November 2003|access-date=21 August 2017|work=La Repubblica|language=Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt; (formal rendering in 2005&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/competition/state_aid/cases/131623/131623_615085_48_1.pdf|title=DECISIONE DELLA COMMISSIONE del 22.VI.2005 relativa alle misure previste dall’Italia a favore delle società sportive professionistiche – (Decreto ”salva calcio”)|date=22 June 2005|access-date=21 August 2017|work=European Commission|publisher=European Union|language=Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

The clubs faced another shortfall in 2007, after Decree-Law 115/2005&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ateservizi.it/Pubblicazioni/vademecum/18mesi/DL%20115-2005.htm|title=DL 115/2005|work=ateservizi.it}}&lt;/ref&gt; abolished Article 18B; they had to abolish the amortization fund by 30 June 2007, five years before the original scheduled date. [[UEFA]] required all clubs to use IFRS, and the fund was incompatible with the standard.

Before 2006, Napoli was bankrupt when its owner refused to increase share capital in 2004 but the club was revived debt-free as a new company by current owner [[Aurelio De Laurentiis]]. When Parma was under administration, most of its [[toxic asset]]s were written off and its balance sheet was transferred to new company Parma FC SpA. [[A.S. Roma]] [[Recapitalization|recapitalized]] several times during the 2003–04 season, swinging between positive and negative net equity since 2006. During the 2005–06 season Roma had a net equity of €67,808,577 in a separate balance sheet, with the special 10-year fund of €80,189,123 on the asset side;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.asroma.it/pdf/corporate/bilanci_e_relazioni/2006-11-06_bilancio_di_esercizio_al_30_giugno_2006.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; if the fund was entirely deferred amortization,&lt;ref group=nb&gt;In descending order, the €80&amp;nbsp;million included [[Gabriele Paoletti|Paoletti]] (€6.564&amp;nbsp;million), [[Davide Bombardini|Bombardini]] (€6.276&amp;nbsp;million), [[Luigi Panarelli|Panarelli]] (€5.964&amp;nbsp;million), Lassissi (€5.163&amp;nbsp;million), Sartor (€4.722&amp;nbsp;million), [[Giuseppe Cattivera|Cattivera]] (€4.317&amp;nbsp;million), Longo (€4.215&amp;nbsp;million) and [[Ivan Pelizzoli|Pelizzoli]] (€4.069&amp;nbsp;million); most had left the club.&lt;/ref&gt; the club had a negative equity of €12,380,546 on the separate balance sheet. Using IFRS in the 2006–07 financial year, on 30 June 2006 Roma had a 2005–06 negative net equity of €22,980,335 on the separate balance sheet. The club created a subsidiary, Soccer SAS di Brand Management, [[Revaluation|revaluing]] the brand at €125.122&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asroma.it/pdf/corporate/bilanci_e_relazioni/2007-12-07_bilancio_di_esercizio_e_consolidato_al_30_giugno_2007.pdf|title=2007 Bilancio |date=18 January 2008|access-date=1 September 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120608041017/http://www.asroma.it/pdf/corporate/bilanci_e_relazioni/2007-12-07_bilancio_di_esercizio_e_consolidato_al_30_giugno_2007.pdf|archivedate=8 June 2012|publisher=A.S.

In 2006–07 Lazio also changed to IFRS, with a reclassified negative net equity for the previous season of €25,406,939. The club overcome the shortfall on a separate balance sheet with subsidiary SS Lazio Marketing &amp; 
Communication, selling its brand to the subsidiary for €104.5&amp;nbsp;million; this boosted the separate balance sheet but not the consolidated one.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sslazio.it/images/stories/documenti/pdf/investor_relator/Bilancio%20S.S.%20Lazio%20s.p.a.%20separato%20e%20consolidato%20al%2030.06.2007.pdf{{dead link|date=April 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Internazionale and Milan made similar moves, despite large cash injections by the owner of both clubs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ju29ro.com/altri-scandali/716-inter-il-buco-nero.html|title=Ju29ro.com - Inter, il buco nero|work=ju29ro.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ju29ro.com/archivi/articoli/altri-scandali/34-altri-scandali/96-la-vendita-del-marchio.html|title=Ju29ro.com - La vendita del marchio|work=ju29ro.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.repubblica.it/2006/11/sezioni/sport/calcio/doping-bilanci/doping-bilanci/doping-bilanci.html|title=Il "doping" nei conti dei big del pallone perdite complessive oltre i 68 milioni|date=9 November 2006|accessdate=15 April 2013|work=la Repubblica|language=Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/2007/gennaio/31/Cessione_del_marchio_Guardia_Finanza_co_9_070131061.shtml|title=Cessione del marchio La Guardia di Finanza fa visita alla Covisoc|date=31 January 2007|accessdate=15 April 2013|work=Corriere della Sera|language=Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''John "Jack" Braithwaite''' (3 January 1885&amp;ndash;29 October 1916) was a New Zealander who served in the [[First World War]] with the [[New Zealand Expeditionary Force]]. A journalist before the war, in 1916 he was convicted of mutiny and executed by firing squad. He was posthumously pardoned in September 2000 through the passage of the [[Pardon for Soldiers of the Great War Act 2000]].

==Early life==
John Braithwaite was born in [[Dunedin]], New Zealand, on 3 January 1885, one of 16 children to a bookseller and his wife. After completing his schooling, he worked alongside his father. He later claimed to have became a journalist and lived in Sydney, Australia, for a time from 1911.&lt;ref name="DNZB Braithwaite"&gt;{{DNZB|title=John Braithwaite|first= Ian|last= McGibbon|authorlink=Ian McGibbon|id=3b44|accessdate=8 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Instead, he was actually in and out of prison in New Zealand for alcohol-related offences.&lt;ref name="Jack Braithwaite"&gt;https://robbiekiwi.wordpress.com/2018/10/29/72-jack-braithwaite/&lt;/ref&gt;

==First World War==
Braithwaite enlisted in the [[New Zealand Expeditionary Force]] (NZEF) in May 1915. Some of his brothers were already serving abroad with the NZEF, one being wounded at Gallipoli.&lt;ref name="DNZB Braithwaite"/&gt; He was posted to the 2nd Battalion of the New Zealand Rifle Brigade and embarked for the Middle East in January 1916.&lt;ref name="cenotaph"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://muse.aucklandmuseum.com/databases/Cenotaph/18458.detail | title = Private John Braithwaite | work = Auckland War Memorial Museum Cenotaph Database |accessdate=8 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within a matter of weeks of arriving in Egypt, he was transferred to 2nd Battalion, Otago Infantry Regiment. Promoted to lance corporal in April, his unit was shipped to France for service on the [[Western Front (WWI)|Western Front]]. His performance as a soldier soon deteriorated.{{sfn|Pugsley|1991|pp=139–140}}

In May 1916, shortly after his arrival in France, Braithwaite was demoted for being absent without leave. The following month, he was courtmartialed for three offences; a second period of absence without leave; lying to an officer; and falsifying a leave pass. He was sentenced to 60-days [[Field punishment|Field Punishment No. 2]] but continued to disregard military discipline. The following month he escaped confinement and on recapture, a senior NZEF officer recommended that he be returned to New Zealand to serve out his punishment. Sentenced to two years imprisonment for his escape, he was being transferred to a prison facility at [[Blargies]] when he evaded his guards and went on the run for two days before being caught. He received a further two-year term of imprisonment.{{sfn|Pugsley|1991|pp=139–140}}

===Mutiny at Blargies===
Sent to Blargies, Braithwaite appeared to settle down and accept prison life. He applied to the commandant of the prison for a suspension of his sentence so that he, and other soldiers of New Zealand and Australia, could return to the front lines. His request was passed to Lieutenant General [[William Birdwood, 1st Baron Birdwood|William Birdwood]], commanding officer of [[I ANZAC Corps]].{{sfn|Pugsley|1991|pp=139–140}} In late August 1916, Braithwaite became involved in a mutiny. Blargies had already been the scene of an earlier mutiny by British soldiers protesting at their treatment. This time, an Australian prisoner had become unruly and began resisting attempts by guards to confine him. Braithwaite intervened and dragged the Australian away from the guards and a gathering crowd of Australian prisoners, already disgruntled at their harsh treatment. He later claimed that he reminded the struggling Australian of the petition to Birdwood and not to jeopardise this and that his (Braithwaite's) actions were aimed at calming the situation. However, he, along with three others, were charged with mutiny.{{sfn|Pugsley|1991|pp=142–145}}

Braithwaite pleaded not guilty, but despite evidence from other prisoners that confirmed his side of the story, a general court martial of five [[British Army]] officers, convicted him of mutiny and conferred a sentence of death by firing squad. The three other soldiers on trial, all Australians, received the same sentence. The decision of the court martial was sent to the commander of the British Expeditionary Force, General [[Douglas Haig, 1st Earl Haig|Douglas Haig]], for approval but was accompanied by a recommendation from the convening officer that the sentences be reduced to a 10-year term of imprisonment.{{sfn|Pugsley|1991|pp=142–145}}

However, Haig, who in dealing with these matters favoured confirming the death sentence for the perceived ringleader while commuting similar sentences for other soldiers involved in the same incident, deemed Braithwaite the responsible party for the mutiny and as was his habit, confirmed the sentence of death. The sentences passed onto the Australians were commuted to two-years punishment with hard labour. Braithwaite was shot by a firing squad early in the morning of 29 October 1916.{{sfn|Pugsley|1991|pp=142–145}} The only New Zealand soldier executed for mutiny during the war, he is buried in the St Sever Cemetery Extension in the city of Rouen.&lt;ref name="cenotaph"/&gt;

==Legacy==
The execution of Braithwaite received little publicity at the time.&lt;ref name="DNZB Braithwaite"/&gt; Even immediately after the war, when the New Zealand government became aware of the severity of his treatment compared to the Australian mutineers, it decided to keep the release of information of the circumstances of his fate to a minimum.{{sfn|Pugsley|1991|p=146}} However, by the 1980s the injustice of Braithwaite's treatment was widely known&lt;ref name="DNZB Braithwaite"/&gt; and in September 2000, the New Zealand Parliament passed a bill, the ''[[Pardon for Soldiers of the Great War Act 2000]]'', that pardoned Braithwaite and four other New Zealand soldiers that were executed during the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pardon for Soldiers of the Great War Act 2000|url=http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/2000/0029/latest/whole.html|website=New Zealand Legalisation|publisher=Parliamentary Counsel Office|accessdate=8 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Justification''' is a [[Criminal defenses|defense]] in a [[criminal case]], by which a defendant who committed the crime as defined, claims he did no wrong, because committing the crime advanced some social interest or vindicated a right of such importance that it outweighs the wrongfulness of the crime.&lt;ref name=CL/&gt; Justification and [[excuse]] are related but different defenses (see [[Justification and excuse]]).&lt;ref name=CL&gt;Criminal Law Cases and Materials, 7th ed. 2012; John Kaplan, Robert Weisberg, Guyora Binder&lt;/ref&gt;

Justification is an exception to the prohibition of committing certain offenses. Justification, as in [[justifiable homicide]], vindicates and shows the justice. Justification can be a defense in a prosecution for a criminal offense. When an act is justified, a person is not criminally liable even though their act would otherwise constitute an offense. For example, to intentionally commit a homicide would be considered murder. However, it is not considered a crime if committed in [[self-defense]].

A justification is not the same as an excuse. In contrast, an [[excuse (legal)]] is a defense that recognizes a crime was committed, but that for the defendant, although committing a socially undesirable crime, conviction and punishment would be morally inappropriate because of an extenuating  personal inadequacy, such as mental defect, lack of mental capacity, sufficient age, intense fear of death, lacking the ability to control their own conduct, etc.&lt;ref name=criminal&gt;

==Definitions==
[[Robert J. Sampson|Sampson]] and Bartusch (1998) defined legal cynicism as ""[[anomie]]" about law".&lt;ref name=sb1998/&gt; Based on Sampson &amp; Bartusch's work, and on that of [[Leo Srole]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Srole |first=Leo |date=1956 |title=Social Integration and Certain Corollaries: An Exploratory Study |jstor=2088422 |journal=American Sociological Review |volume=21 |issue=6 |pages=709–716 |doi=10.2307/2088422}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alex Piquero|Piquero]] et al. (2005) defined it based on respondents' answers to a five-question survey. In the survey, respondents were asked to rank, on a four-point scale, the extent to which they agreed with each of these statements: 
{{blockquote|
# Laws are meant to be broken, 
#It is okay to do anything you want, 
#There are no right or wrong ways to make money, 
#If I have a fight with someone, it is no one else's business, and 
#A person has to live without thinking about the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=PIQUERO |first=ALEX R. |last2=FAGAN |first2=JEFFREY |last3=MULVEY |first3=EDWARD P. |last4=STEINBERG |first4=LAURENCE |last5=ODGERS |first5=CANDICE |date=2005-09-01 |title=DEVELOPMENTAL TRAJECTORIES OF LEGAL SOCIALIZATION AMONG SERIOUS ADOLESCENT OFFENDERS |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2776646/ |journal=The Journal of Criminal Law &amp; Criminology |volume=96 |issue=1 |pages=267–298 |issn=0091-4169 |pmc=2776646 |pmid=19915683}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Causes and correlates==
Legal cynicism can be exacerbated when police engage in aggressive misconduct in a community, which can lead to greater violence and less cooperation between the community's citizens and the police.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.vox.com/2016/9/30/13115224/crime-violent-reduce-ferguson-murder-fbi-ucr |title=The surge in violent crime is overblown — but here's how to combat it |last=Abt |first=Thomas |date=2016-09-30 |website=Vox |access-date=2017-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been found to be higher in neighborhoods with higher levels of [[concentrated disadvantage]], even after controlling for demographic factors and crime rates.&lt;ref name=sb1998&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Sampson |first=Robert J. |last2=Bartusch |first2=Dawn Jeglum |date=1998 |title=Legal Cynicism and (Subcultural?)

Legal cynicism and legitimacy both have significant effects on criminal offending, even after accounting for [[self-control]].&lt;ref name=cjb/&gt; Legal cynicism is also associated with lower rates of desistance from [[intimate partner violence]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Emery |first=Clifton R. |last2=Jolley |first2=Jennifer M. |last3=Wu |first3=Shali |date=2011-12-01 |title=Desistance from Intimate Partner Violence: the Role of Legal Cynicism, Collective Efficacy, and Social Disorganization in Chicago Neighborhoods |journal=American Journal of Community Psychology |language=en |volume=48 |issue=3–4 |pages=373–383 |doi=10.1007/s10464-010-9362-5 |pmid=20963479 |issn=1573-2770}}&lt;/ref&gt; higher [[homicide]] rates,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Kirk |first=David S. |last2=Papachristos |first2=Andrew V. |date=2011-01-01 |title=Cultural Mechanisms and the Persistence of Neighborhood Violence |journal=American Journal of Sociology |volume=116 |issue=4 |pages=1190–1233 |doi=10.1086/655754 |issn=0002-9602}}&lt;/ref&gt; and higher [[recidivism]] rates among released prisoners.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://webarchive.urban.org/publications/410974.html |title=Returning Home: Understanding the Challenges of Prisoner Reentry: Maryland Pilot Study: Findings from Baltimore |last=Visher |first=Christy |date=2004-01-01 |website=Urban Institute |access-date=2018-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been found to affect parents' assessments of their adolescent children's violent behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Soller |first=Brian |last2=Jackson |first2=Aubrey L. |last3=Browning |first3=Christopher R. |date=2014-07-01 |title=Legal Cynicism and Parental Appraisals of Adolescent Violence |url=https://academic.oup.com/bjc/article/54/4/568/452580 |journal=The British Journal of Criminology |volume=54 |issue=4 |pages=568–591 |doi=10.1093/bjc/azu027 |pmid=24932013 |issn=0007-0955|pmc=4055156 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Legality of bestiality in the United States''' looks at the laws prohibiting [[bestiality]] in the [[United States of America]]. The legality of sex with animals has been steadily decreasing over the past 20 years. As of February 10, 2018, 45 states and 2 territories ban sex with animals, while 5 states and the District of Columbia have decriminalized it (due to repeal of [[Sodomy laws in the United States|sodomy laws]]).&lt;ref name="Lawzoo1"&gt;{{Cite web |title=Table of State Animal Sexual Assault Laws |url = http://www.animallaw.info/topic/table-state-animal-sexual-assault-laws|website=Animallaw.info |accessdate=2016-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, five states ([[Texas]], [[Kentucky]], [[West Virginia]], [[Vermont]] and [[Nevada]]) introduced legislation to ban bestiality, with Nevada, Vermont, and Texas enacting laws banning it in 2017.&lt;ref name="TX1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://legiscan.com/TX/bill/HB1087/2017|title=Texas HB1087 - 2017-2018 - 85th Legislature|website=Legiscan.com|accessdate=13 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="KY1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://legiscan.com/KY/bill/HB480/2017|title=Kentucky HB480 - 2017 - Regular Session|website=Legiscan.com|accessdate=13 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WV1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://legiscan.com/WV/bill/HB2664/2017|title=West Virginia HB2664 - 2017 - Regular Session|website=Legiscan.com|accessdate=13 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="VT1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://legiscan.com/VT/bill/H0325/2017|title=Vermont H0325 - 2017-2018 - Regular Session|website=Legiscan.com|accessdate=13 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NV1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://legiscan.com/NV/bill/AB391/2017|title=Nevada AB391 - 2017 - 79th Legislature|website=Legiscan.com|accessdate=13 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[New Hampshire]] and [[Ohio]] also banned sex with animals in 2017 (they had 2016 bills which went into effect in 2017).&lt;ref name="Newhampshire"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ohio2016"/&gt;

In late 2017, a bill was introduced in [[Wisconsin]] which intends to make sex with animals a felony there.&lt;ref name="WI2018"&gt;https://legiscan.com/WI/bill/AB666/2017 Wisconsin Assembly Bill 666 (2017). Legiscan.com&lt;/ref&gt; In 2018, five bills were introduced to ban sex with animals: in [[California]] (the California bill would make sex with animals a felony), [[Louisiana]] (criminalizes promoting or encouraging it), [[Hawaii]], [[Kentucky]], and [[West Virginia]].&lt;ref name="HI2018"&gt;https://legiscan.com/HI/bill/SB2289/2018 Hawaii Senate Bill 2289 (2018).

Several states, including [[Oregon]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]], [[Tennessee]], [[Illinois]], [[Florida]], [[Alaska]] and [[Ohio]], criminalize [[free speech]] related to sex with animals (such as promoting or encouraging it).&lt;ref name="Lawzoo1" /&gt; These laws have all been recently enacted.

[[Ohio]] has the most lenient prison sentences among states with misdemeanor penalties prohibiting bestiality among any state, with a maximum of 90 days in prison and a $750 dollar fine. [[Michigan]] has the most lenient prison sentences among states with minimum felony penalties prohibiting bestiality among any state, with a minimum of 1 day in prison. [[Maryland]] has the harshest maximum prison sentences among states with misdemeanor penalties prohibiting bestiality among any state, with a maximum of 10 years in prison and/or a maximum of a $1,000 dollar fine. [[Rhode Island]] has the harshest minimum prison sentence among states with felony penalties prohibiting bestiality, with a minimum of 7 years in prison. [[Idaho]] and Michigan both have the harshest maximum prison sentences among states with felony penalties prohibiting bestiality among any state, with a maximum of [[life in prison]].

==Advocacy organizations in the United States==
===Pro-zoophilia organizations in the United States===
At the 1969 [[Libertarian Party (US)|Libertarian]] Conference held in [[New York City, New York]], [[Murray Rothbard]] claimed a [[Neo-Objectivisim|Neo-Randian]] group called Students of Objectivism for Rational Bestiality existed. These so-called "Bestiality Boys" promoted what they called "Rational Bestiality". Their contention was that "bestiality is illegal because humans are irrational animals and that, if humans were rational, citizens would not be arrested and jailed for engaging in sexual acts with the animals they own."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://drtomstevens.blogspot.com/2013/06/support-for-decriminalization-of.html|title=Rising Action : Support For The Decriminalization Of Bestiality Is Becoming A Key Issue For Libertarian Leaders|first=Dr Tom|last=Stevens|date=25 June 2013|website=Drtomstevens.blogspot.com|accessdate=13 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lewrockwell.com/1970/01/murray-n-rothbard/understanding-ayn-randianism/|title=Understanding Ayn Randianism - LewRockwell|website=LewRockwell.com|accessdate=13 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anti-zoophilia organizations in the United States===
[[The Humane Society of the United States]] is one of the leading American organizations to criminalize bestiality in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.browardpalmbeach.com/news/those-who-practice-bestiality-say-theyre-part-of-the-next-sexual-rights-movement-6334747|title=Those Who Practice Bestiality Say They're Part of the Next Sexual Rights Movement|first=Thomas|last=Francis|date=20 August 2009|website=Browardpalmbeach.com|accessdate=13 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legality of bestiality in the United States of America==
;Federal law
Laws against bestiality and sodomy in the United States are largely a matter of state rather than federal jurisdiction, except for laws governing the District of Columbia and the U.S. Armed Forces. There is no federal law which explicitly prohibits sex between humans and animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lectlaw.com/files/sex13.htm|title=Zoophilia &amp; The Law - Laws Around The World Affecting Zoophiles|publisher=|accessdate=14 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The only federal law prohibiting [[zoophilic pornography]], is 18 USC 2256, which prohibits distribution in [[interstate commerce]] and on [[federal property]] of child pornography of a minor under 18 years old engaging in "sexually explicit conduct" of bestiality.&lt;ref name="UScode"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2256|title=18 U.S. Code § 2256 - Definitions for chapter|publisher=|accessdate=14 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Constitutional definition of [[obscenity]] was narrowed by the [[US Supreme Court]] in the 1985 case ''[[Brockett v. Spokane Arcades, Inc.]]'', which the court endorsed the [[Model Penal Code]] of obscenity. The Model Penal Code prohibition against deviate sexual intercourse includes "sexual intercourse ''per os'' or ''per anum'' between human beings who are not husband and wife, and any form of sexual intercourse with an animal." Federal law does not ban obscenity outright; it leaves this to state and local law. Federal statutes prohibit, among other things, the transmission of obscene matter as defined by state law, in interstate commerce and on federal land.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.llrx.com/features/obscenitylaws.htm|title=Features - Constitutional, Federal and State Legal Definitions of Child Pornography, Obscenity and "Harmful to Minors" of Interest to California Libraries - LLRX.com|publisher=|accessdate=14 January 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150819000832/http://www.llrx.com/features/obscenitylaws.htm|archivedate=19 August 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;District of Columbia

In 1801, Congress enacted the [[District of Columbia Organic Act of 1801]] that continued all criminal laws of Maryland and Virginia in the now formally structured District, with those of Maryland applying to that portion of the District ceded from Maryland, and those of Virginia applying to that portion ceded from Virginia. At the time, Maryland had a sodomy law applicable only to free males with a punishment of "labor for any time, in their discretion, not exceeding seven years for the same crime, on the public roads of the said county, or in making, repairing or cleaning the streets or bason [sic] of Baltimore-town" and the death penalty for slaves committing sodomy, while Virginia had a penalty of 1–10 years for free persons committing sodomy, but had the death penalty for slaves committing sodomy. The law went into effect on February 27, 1801.&lt;ref name="DC Sodomy law" /&gt;

In 1831, Congress established penalties in the District of Columbia for a number of crimes, but not for sodomy. It specified that "every other felony, misdemeanor, or offence not provided for by this act, may and shall be punished as heretofore[.]" At the time, Maryland and Virginia had a penalty of 1–10 years for committing sodomy. It went into effect in March 2, 1831.&lt;ref name="DC Sodomy law" /&gt;

In 1892, Congress passed a law for the District of Columbia that states that "for the preservation of the public peace and the protection of property within the District of Columbia." Labeled in the law as vagrants were "all public prostitutes, and all such persons who lead a notoriously lewd or lascivious course of life[.]" All offenders had to post bond of up to $200 for good behavior for a period of six months. The law went into effect on July 29, 1892.&lt;ref name="DC Sodomy law" /&gt;

In 1898, Congress deleted the word "notoriously" from the provision concerning a lewd or lascivious course of life, thereby allowing prosecution of those without notoriety. The bond for good behavior was raised to $500, and the law was made clearly gender-neutral. The law went into effect on July 8, 1898.&lt;ref name="DC Sodomy law" /&gt;

In 1901, Congress adopting a new code for the District of Columbia that expressly recognized [[Common law offence|common-law crimes]], with a penalty for them of up to five years and/or a $1,000 fine. The law went into effect on March 3, 1901.&lt;ref name="DC Sodomy law" /&gt;

In 1935, Congress passed a law for the District of Columbia that made it a crime for "any person to invite, entice, persuade, or to address for the purpose of inviting, enticing, or persuading any person or persons...to accompany, to go with, to follow him or her to his or her residence, or to any other house or building, inclosure, or other place, for the purpose of prostitution, or any other immoral or lewd purpose." It imposed a fine of up to $100, up to 90 days in jail, and courts were permitted to "impose conditions" on anyone convicted under this law, including "medical and mental examination, diagnosis and treatment by proper public health and welfare authorities, and such other terms and conditions as the court may deem best for the protection of the community and the punishment, control, and rehabilitation of the defendant." The law went into effect on August 14, 1935.&lt;ref name="DC Sodomy law" /&gt;

In 1948, Congress enacted the first sodomy law in the District of Columbia, which established a penalty of up to 10 years in prison or a fine of up to $1,000 for sodomy. Also included with this sodomy law was a psychopathic offender law and a law "to provide for the treatment of sexual psychopaths in the District of Columbia, and for other purposes." The law went into effect on June 9, 1948.&lt;ref name="DC Sodomy law" /&gt;

In 1981, after the District of Columbia regained home rule from Congress, it enacted a law that repealed the sodomy law, as well as other consensual acts, and made the sexual assault laws gender-neutral. However, the U.S. House exercised the power that it retained to veto laws passed by the District of Columbia Council. On October 1, 1981, the House voted 281-119 to disallow the new law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/97-1981/h214|title=TO TABLE THE PHILLIP CRANE MOTION TO DISCHARGE THE HOUSE COMMITTEE ON THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA FROM FURTHER CONSIDERATION OF H.

;United States Armed Forces
On March 1, 1917, the [[Articles of War]] of 1916 are implemented. This included a revision of the Articles of War of 1806, the new regulations detail statutes governing U.S. military discipline and justice. Under the category Miscellaneous Crimes and Offences, Article 93 states that any person subject to military law who commits "assault with intent to commit sodomy" shall be punished as a court-martial may direct.&lt;ref name="usni"&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.usni.org/news-and-features/dont-ask-dont-tell/timeline |title=Key Dates in US Policy on Gay Men and Women in the United States Military |publisher=usni.org |date= |accessdate=2014-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 4, 1920, Congress modified Article 93 of the Articles of War of 1916. It was changed to make the act of sodomy itself a crime, separate from the offense of assault with intent to commit sodomy.&lt;ref name="usni" /&gt; It went into effect on February 4, 1921.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/ref/AW/index.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081004163647/http://ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/ref/AW/index.html|title=HyperWar: The Articles of War, Approved June 4, 1920|archivedate=4 October 2008|publisher=|accessdate=14 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 5, 1950, the [[Uniform Code of Military Justice|UCMJ]] was passed by Congress and was signed into law by President [[Harry S. Truman]], and became effective on May 31, 1951. Article 125 forbids sodomy among all military personnel, defining it as "any person subject to this chapter who engages in unnatural carnal copulation with another person of the same or opposite sex or with an animal is guilty of sodomy. Penetration, however slight, is sufficient to complete the offence."&lt;ref name="usni" /&gt;

On December 1, 2011, the US Senate voted 93-7 in favor of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012, which contained in it a provision repealing Article 125 of the UCMJ. The bill died in Congress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/112-2011/s218|title=S. 1867 (112th): National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012|work=GovTrack.us|accessdate=14 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 26, 2013, President Barack Obama signed the [[National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2014]] into law. The law repealed the ban on consensual sodomy found in Article 125 and added a specific provision in Article 125 of the UCMJ that specifically bans bestiality:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Johnson|first=Chris|title=Defense bill contains gay-related provisions |url=http://www.washingtonblade.com/2013/12/20/defense-bill-contains-gay-related-provisions/|accessdate=December 21, 2013|newspaper=Washington Blade|date=December 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 16, 2016, President [[Barack Obama]] signed Executive Order 13740, which included new provision under the UCMJ to apply anywhere on Earth where the United States Armed Forces military is stationed and will be on a par with states’ [[cruelty to animals|animal cruelty]] statutes.

According to Leighann Lassiter, director of animal abuse for the [[Humane Society of the United States]], the ''[[Lawrence v. Texas]]'' ruling that struck down all statutes in the United States prohibiting consensual human sexual intercourse can also block prosecution of bestiality. “Cases have been turned over on appeal because of unclear language in the law, and often times no charges are brought at all,” said Leighann. Currently, 10 states, [[Idaho]], [[Kansas]], [[Maryland]], [[Massachusetts]], [[Michigan]], [[Minnesota]], [[Mississippi]], [[North Carolina]], [[Oklahoma]], and [[South Carolina]], have a statute that prohibit both consensual human sexual intercourse and bestiality.&lt;ref&gt;[https://melmagazine.com/what-activists-are-doing-to-fight-the-rampant-growth-of-bestiality-f1fb9b7985fd What Activists Are Doing to Fight the Rampant Growth of Bestiality]&lt;/ref&gt;

His father told ''[[Dawn (newspaper)|DAWN]]'' that "Mashal was devoted to his studies and would study for 15 hours a day. He believed education was essential for a full life and encouraged his brother and sisters to study as well. His father added that Mashal was a "peaceful, tolerant person."&lt;ref name="dawn2/16april2017" /&gt; and that he wrote poetry in [[Pashto language|Pashto]].&lt;ref name="tribune1/17 april 2017" /&gt; Khan had one brother and two sisters&lt;ref name="tribune1/17 april 2017" /&gt; and was 23 years old at the time of his murder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Shah|first1=Sadia Qasim|title=Of indifference and empathy|url=https://www.dawn.com/news/1327118/of-indifference-and-empathy|accessdate=18 April 2017|work=DAWN.COM|date=15 April 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Mobsters lynch Mardan student over 'blasphemy'|url=http://dailytimes.com.pk/pakistan/14-Apr-17/mobsters-lynch-mardan-student-over-blasphemy|accessdate=18 April 2017|work=dailytimes.com.pk|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Geo News]] reported that his teacher told it "Mashal was a humanist, he was into socialism and Sufism".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Teacher says Mashal was not given chance to prove his innocence|url=https://www.geo.tv/latest/138460-Teacher-resigns-apologises-to-nation-for-failure-to-save-Mashal|accessdate=18 April 2017|work=www.geo.tv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='University admin responsible for lynching,' says Mashal Khan's teacher|url=http://nation.com.pk/national/18-Apr-2017/university-admin-responsible-for-lynching-says-mashal-khan-s-teacher|accessdate=18 April 2017|work=The Nation}}&lt;/ref&gt; A teacher described Khan as an engaged and thoughtful student.

==Incident==
===Background===
;National politics and blasphemy
In March 2017, the Prime Minister of Pakistan Nawaz Sharif [[Internet censorship in Pakistan|supported a crackdown]] on blasphemous material posted on social media and described blasphemy as an "unpardonable offence".&lt;ref name="bbc/13april2017" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Pakistani student accused of blasphemy beaten to death on campus|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-pakistan-blasphemy-idUSKBN17F1ZL|accessdate=15 April 2017|work=Reuters|date=13 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Mashal Khan criticisms of AWK University's administrators
Before his death Mashal Khan criticized the Abdul Wali Khan University but none of his comments mentioned religion or contained blasphemy. He revealed that the vice-chancellor never attended the university and students were forced to study in uncertainty of whether or not they would receive the degrees for which they were studying. He criticised teachers, accused them of bureaucracy and said that a single faculty member was in charge of multiple responsibilities. According to him "everyone in authority is a thief here." The way the university collected outstanding dues was also criticised as it charged students Rs. 25,000, while other universities only collected Rs. 5,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Mashal Khan Revealed Shocking Details About His University In An Interview Before His Death!|url=https://www.parhlo.com/mashal-khan-interview/|accessdate=24 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An eyewitness at the scene of the incident said Khan was attacked because he was believed to be promoting the Ahmadi faith on Facebook. Reports say a university administrator and several leaders of the university's student body were part of the attacking mob.&lt;ref&gt;http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/in-pakistan-journalism-student-lynched-by-screaming-mob-for-blasphemy/articleshow/58175291.cms&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dawn1/13april2017" /&gt; An unknown official at the university said "Khan was disliked by other students for his liberal and secular views."&lt;ref name="bbc/13april2017" /&gt; At least 20 police officers were present at the scene, but they were unable to control the situation.&lt;ref name="dawn1/13april2017" /&gt; The university campus was shut down following his death and its hostels were vacated to avoid a further escalation of violence.&lt;ref name="dawn1/13april2017" /&gt;

==Mashal Khan's funeral==
On the following day (14 April), Mashal Khan's funeral was led by his father, a local poet. Most neighbours kept away from the funeral, as threats made earlier by a local to anyone attending led them to fear follow-up attacks from religious mobs.&lt;ref name="Yousafzai"&gt;{{cite|title=I attended Mashal Khan's funeral prayer, when others refused: Sherin Yousafzai|last=Yousafzai|first=Sherin |url=https://www.geo.tv/latest/138922-I-attended-Mashal-Khans-funeral-prayers-when-others-refused|year=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some elders nevertheless joined, calling over neighbours to show support and a few dozen people eventually joined the procession.&lt;ref name="Yousafzai" /&gt; In the following days, as information and national support emerged, neighbours expressed regret for not being able to protect Mashal nor supporting the Khans more on the day of the funeral.&lt;ref name="KhanM0421" /&gt;

==Investigation and arrests==
Following the death of Khan, at least 45 people were arrested.&lt;ref name="dawn1/13april2017" /&gt;

===Initial Investigation===
According to police investigations, Mashal Khan had not carried out any blasphemous action. The Inspector General Police stated "We did not find any concrete evidence under which an investigation or legal action can be launched against Mashal, Abdullah or Zubair".&lt;ref name="Bangash0417"/&gt;

According to Abdullah, the AWK University's administration summoned him to the Mass Communications chairman's office, where they pressured him into accusing Mashal of blasphemy.&lt;ref name="Bangash0417" /&gt; When Abdullah refused as "Neither Mashal nor I had committed any blasphemy", the administration issued the online notification, then went to punish Abdullah by beating and Mashal by lynching.&lt;ref name="Bangash0417" /&gt;

According to the testimony of one of the prime accused, Wajahat Ullah, collected by the police, 15 to 20 persons were at the office of the chairman discussing the three students' controversial views when he was called over by fellow student Mudassar Bashir, the representative of the class.&lt;ref name="Ali04"&gt;{{cite|last=Ali|first=Arshad|year=2017|date=|title=Mardan University security incharge incited mob to murder Mashal: prime accused|url=http://khybernews.tv/76681-2/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lecturers Ziaullah Hamdard and Pir Asfandyar, clerks Anees, Saeed and Idrees, and superintendent Arshad were present and summoned him on the issue. Class representative Mudassar Bashir asked him to become a witness of the alleged blasphemy, while clerk Idrees repeated his opposition to having a communist in AWK University.&lt;ref name="Ali04" /&gt; The proposition of creating a committee of inquiry was opposed by clerk Idrees and class leader Bashir, while security in-charge Bilal Bakhsh declared his will to handle the issue quickly, occasionally stating his will to kill the student.&lt;ref name="Ali04" /&gt; The group processed toward Mashal's hostel, calling for bystanders to join and turning the expedition into an angry punitive mob.&lt;ref name="Bangash0417" /&gt;

===Arrests===
On 21 April, AWKUM's superintendent and office's assistant were imprisoned on judicial remand.&lt;ref name="Khan0421"&gt;{{cite|first=Farhan|last=Khan|date=21 April 2017|url=http://khybernews.tv/mashal-lynching-case-superintendent-awkum-imprisoned-on-judicial-remand/|title=MASHAL LYNCHING CASE: SUPERINTENDENT AWKUM SENT TO JAIL ON JUDICIAL REMAND}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the accused were sent to the Anti-Terrorism Court (ATC).&lt;ref name="Khan0421" /&gt;

It was reported that the administration of the university, through a notification dated 13 April 2017, rusticated Khan and decided to investigate Khan for alleged "blasphemous activity". A provost of the university said the notification was issued after the death of Khan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.dawn.com/news/1326944/mardan-university-takes-action-against-victims-launches-probe-into-blasphemous-activity|title=Mardan university takes action against victims; launches probe into 'blasphemous activity'|last=Akbar|first=Dawn.com {{!}} Ali|date=14 April 2017|work=DAWN.COM|accessdate=14 April 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===JIT Report===
The 13-member Joint Investigation Team (JIT) constituted by the [[Supreme Court of Pakistan]] in response to the lynching gave its final report on 3 June 2017. The report cleared Mashal of all blasphemy charges and termed his lynching a premeditated murder conducted by certain elements in the student body and the university administration. The report also cleared Mashal's two friends, Abdullah and Zubair, of any blasphemy while raising questions about the efficacy of Mardan Police's response to the incident.&lt;ref name="trib"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Firdous|first1=Iftikhar|title=Plot to 'get rid of' Mashal Khan was hatched a month before murder, concludes JIT|url=https://tribune.com.pk/story/1427069/plot-get-rid-mashal-khan-hatched-month-murder-concludes-jit/|website=The Express Tribune}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ptoday"&gt;{{cite web|title=JIT finds a student group incited mob against Mashal|url=https://www.pakistantoday.com.pk/2017/06/04/jit-finds-a-student-group-incited-mob-against-mashal/|website=Pakistan Today}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Akbar|first1=Ali|title=Mashal murder case: JIT finds group in university incited mob against student on pretext of blasphemy|url=https://www.dawn.com/news/1337373/mashal-murder-case-jit-finds-group-in-university-incited-mob-against-student-on-pretext-of-blasphemy|website=Dawn.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the report, the two prime inciters of the lynching were Sabir Mayer, president of the [[Pukhtoon Students Federation]], and Ajmal Khan, president of the university's employee union. Ajmal confessed that a month before the lynching, Sabir, along with a university employee, Asad Katlang, came to his office and told him that they had to "get rid of Mashal" as he was a "threat to the party" (the 'party' is presumed to be the leftist political party, [[Awami National Party]], whose student federation Sabir headed). The trio then proceeded to hatch a plan for Mashal's murder.&lt;ref name="trib" /&gt;

As stated in the report, the prime reason for Mashal's lynching was his constant criticism of the university's administration. A month before his lynching, he gave a television interview to [[AVT Khyber]], a regional news channel, in which he alleged that illegal and criminal activities persisted in the university hostel and female students were also exploited in the university.&lt;ref name="ptoday" /&gt;

It was further found that the university had serious management issues where top posts were filled by people of criminal background due to their political affiliation. It has been suggested in the report that strict departmental action should be taken against registrar Sher Alam, director administration Peer Asfandyar, chief security officer Inayatullah Afridi, provost Fayaz Ali Shah, chief proctor professor Idrees, director sports professor Farooq and assistant registrar Humyaun for their incompetence.&lt;ref name="trib" /&gt;

In its conclusion, the report, which will be submitted to the Supreme Court and the anti-terrorism court (ATC), has suggested severe punishments for the university employees and students involved in the crime.&lt;ref name="trib" /&gt;

'''Maine Question 1''' was a voter referendum on an initiated state statute that occurred November 6, 2012. The title of the citizen initiative is "An Act to Allow Marriage Licenses for Same-Sex Couples and Protect Religious Freedom". The question that appeared on the ballot was: "Do you want to allow the [[State of Maine]] to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples?"

The law took effect on December 29, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5h5x18bf8Ysv4kNG7YDOvlCBROHYA?docId=4bf93adb278c450391c481978e11df20 Gay marriage law goes into effect in Maine]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
In 2009, same-sex marriage legalization, "An Act To End Discrimination in Civil Marriage and Affirm Religious Freedom", was passed by the legislature and signed into law by Governor [[John Baldacci]]. A 2009 people's veto [[Maine Question 1, 2009|referendum]] to reject the law passed 53 to 47 percent, invalidating the law before it took effect.

On June 30, 2011, [[EqualityMaine]] and [[Gay &amp; Lesbian Advocates &amp; Defenders]] (GLAD) announced plans to place a voter initiative in support of same-sex marriage on Maine's November 2012 ballot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |work=Portland Press Herald |url=http://www.pressherald.com/news/maine-Gay-marriage-referendum.html |first=David |last=Sharp |title=Gay marriage supporters aiming for 2012 referendum |date=June 30, 2011 |accessdate=February 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Supporters delivered more than 105,000 petition signatures for the initiative to the Secretary of State's office on January 26, 2012, exceeding the minimum of 57,277 signatures requirement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sunjournal.com/comment/91821 |title=It's on: Same-sex marriage supporters give it another try|date=January 26, 2012 |author=Steve Mistler |work=Lewiston Sun Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |agency=Associated Press |first=Glenn |last=Adams |date=January 26, 2012 |url=http://www.timesunion.com/news/article/Maine-poised-for-2nd-public-vote-on-gay-marriage-2691837.php |title=Maine poised for 2nd public vote on gay marriage |publisher=Times-Union}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Secretary of State announced on February 23 that the office verified 85,216 signatures, qualifying the initiative for the November 2012 ballot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bangordailynews.com/2012/02/23/politics/secretary-of-state-says-same-sex-marriage-will-be-on-the-ballot/ |title=Secretary of state says same-sex marriage will be on the ballot |date=February 23, 2012 |first=Judy |last=Harrison |publisher=Bangor Daily News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under Maine's constitution a valid initiative must be sent to the voters unless enacted in the proposed form by the Legislature at the same session during which it was presented. In March 2012, the Maine Legislature voted to indefinitely postpone the initiative without debate, effectively putting it on the November ballot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wmtw.com/r/30667750/detail.html |title=Maine Same-Sex Marriage Bill Step Closer To Voters |date=March 13, 2012 |publisher=WMTV}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.onlinesentinel.com/news/Same-sex-marriage-officially-on-November-ballot.html |title=Same-sex marriage closer to November ballot |first=Susan M. |last=Cover |publisher=Morning Sentinel |date=March 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seacoastonline.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20120315/NEWS/203150397/-1/NEWSMAP Senate sends gay marriage question to Maine voters]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ballot question==
On June 14, 2012, [[Secretary of State of Maine|Maine Secretary of State]] [[Charlie Summers]], who opposed same-sex marriage,&lt;ref name=summers&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bangordailynews.com/2012/06/20/politics/more-words-needed-in-same-sex-marriage-ballot-question-supporters-say/ |title=Supporters want a wordier same-sex marriage question on November's ballot |date=June 20, 2012 |accessdate=June 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; released the draft wording of the question as it would appear on the ballot, beginning a 30-day public comment period, at the end of which he had ten days to determine the wording of the question.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bangordailynews.com/2012/06/14/politics/draft-of-gay-marriage-question-released/ |title=Draft of Maine same-sex marriage question released |date=June 14, 2012 |accessdate=June 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He proposed the following wording:

{{quote|Do you want to allow same-sex couples to marry?}}

The petitions that supporters circulated was as follows:&lt;ref name="approved"&gt;{{cite web |work=Bangor Daily News |url=http://bangordailynews.com/2011/08/17/politics/same-sex-marriage-petition-approved/ |first=Eric |last=Russell |title=Signature-gathering campaign to begin on Maine same-sex marriage initiative |date=August 17, 2011 |accessdate=February 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Do you favor a law allowing marriage licenses for same-sex couples, and that protects religious freedom by ensuring that no religion or clergy be required to perform such a marriage in violation of their religious beliefs?}}

Opponents of the initiative claimed that latter part of the circulated question is unnecessary, as the religious freedom to refuse to perform same-sex marriages is guaranteed by the [[First Amendment of the United States Constitution]]. They also criticized the wording for failing to mention redefining marriage. Supporters of the initiative said the Secretary of State's proposed wording "fails to address important parts of the initiative that will be on the ballot in November". Though they concede the First Amendment point made by the measure's opponents, they asked Summers, whose good faith they did not question,&lt;ref name=summers /&gt; to restore the reference to protecting religious freedom because they claim opponents "distort the {{sic|facts |hide=y|around}} what the approval of same-sex marriage will do, including the possibility that churches would lose their tax-exempt status by refusing to perform same-sex marriages."&lt;ref name="summers"/&gt;

The final wording Summers chose is "Do you want to allow the State of Maine to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples?" Representatives of both sides of the issue stated they had no major problems with Summers' decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |work=Bangor Daily News |url=http://bangordailynews.com/2012/07/26/politics/final-wording-of-same-sex-marriage-question-issued/ |first=Judy |last=Harrison |title=Final wording of same-sex marriage question issued |date=July 26, 2012 |accessdate=July 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Campaign==
EqualityMaine and Mainers United for Marriage began the campaign for the initiative on May 15, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bangordailynews.com/2012/05/15/news/state/same-sex-marriage-supporters-kick-off-maine-campaign-by-going-door-to-door/?ref=latest |title=Same-sex marriage supporters kick off Maine campaign by going door to door |date=May 15, 2012 |first=Judy |last=Harrison |publisher=Bangor Daily News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By June 28, Mainers United for Marriage had raised over $1 million, and 64 percent of those contributions had come from within Maine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bangordailynews.com/2012/06/28/politics/same-sex-marriage-supporters-say-theyve-raised-1-million/ |title=Same-sex marriage supporters say they've raised $1 million |date=June 28, 2012 |accessdate=June 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 23, the Maine ACLU and Mainers United for Marriage held a press conference to announce the formation of the group [[Maine Republican Party|Republican]]s United for Marriage as part of an effort to attract more Republican support of the initiative. Fifteen Republicans appeared at the conference, including three current [[Maine Legislature|state legislators]]. One of those, Rep. Stacey Fitts of [[Pittsfield, Maine|Pittsfield]], had voted against the 2009 same-sex marriage law passed by the previous Legislature but stated that he has now changed his mind after discussions with gay persons that he knows and his family. Fitts also said he felt his new views were a "perfect match" with his Republican philosophy of small government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bangordailynews.com/2012/07/23/politics/same-sex-marriage-advocates-introduce-republican-supporters/ |title=Same-sex marriage advocates introduce Republican supporters|date=July 23, 2012 |accessdate=July 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pastor Bob Emerich, a spokesman for initiative opponents, dismissed the announcement as "insignificant" and questioned "why these people even call themselves Republicans."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kjonline.com/news/Gay-marriage-group-to-unveil-Republican-supporters.html |title=Marriage equality group unveils Republican supporters|date=July 23, 2012 |accessdate=July 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[President of the United States|President]] [[Barack Obama]], through a spokesperson, endorsed the initiative on October 24.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Stone|first=Matthew|title=Obama backs Maine’s same-sex marriage measure|url=http://capitolincite.bangordailynews.com/2012/10/25/obama-backs-maines-same-sex-marriage-measure/|accessdate=25 October 2012|newspaper=Bangor Daily News|date=25 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Richard Joseph Malone|Richard Malone]], former [[Catholicism|Catholic]] Bishop of [[Portland, Maine|Portland]], stated on October 25 that supporting the initiative was "unfaithful to Catholic doctrine" and that Catholics whose conscience was formed through scripture could not justify voting for any candidate or referendum that opposes the teachings of the Church. He said that Catholics for Marriage Equality did not speak for the Catholic Church.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bangordailynews.com/2012/10/25/politics/ex-maine-bishop-says-voting-for-gay-marriage-unfaithful-to-catholic-doctrine/ |title=Former Maine bishop says voting for gay marriage 'unfaithful to Catholic doctrine'|date=October 25, 2012 |accessdate=October 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Democratic [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representatives]] [[Chellie Pingree]] and [[Mike Michaud]] both stated they intended to vote in favor of the referendum, while Republican [[United States Senate|U.S. Senators]] [[Susan Collins]] and [[Olympia Snowe]] both stated that their policy was to not comment on state level issues.  [[Governor of Maine|Governor]] [[Paul LePage]], through his spokeswoman, also declined to offer his views on the referendum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kjonline.com/politics/most-maine-top-elected-officials-steer-clear-of-gay-marriage-issue_2012-11-04.html|title=Most Maine top elected officials steer clear of gay-marriage issue|publisher=Kennebec Journal |date=November 5, 2012 |accessdate=November 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Collins and Snowe would both state their support for same-sex marriage after the referendum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2013/04/05/now-out-of-senate-snowe-supports-same-sex-marriage/|publisher=CNN |title=Now out of Senate, Snowe supports same-sex marriage|author=Lisa Desjardins|date=April 5, 2013|accessdate=April 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Susan Collins: I support same-sex marriage|url=http://bangordailynews.com/2014/06/25/politics/elections/susan-collins-i-support-same-sex-marriage/|date=June 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The referendum was declared passed on November 6, 2012 by the Associated Press, and opposition group Protect Marriage Maine conceded at 1:30 am on November 7, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Cover|first=Susan|title=Mainers vote to legalize same-sex marriage|url=http://www.pressherald.com/politics/Same-sex-marriage-question-challenges-voters-from-the-heart.html|accessdate=7 November 2012|newspaper=Portland Press Herald|date=7 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 53% of Maine voted in favor.

'''Migu''' or ''miggo'' (translation: "since") (Hebrew: מיגו) is a [[Talmudic law]] concept relating to civil law disputes. A migu is a reason that a claim that would otherwise be rejected by a Jewish civil court should be accepted based on the fact that the [[litigant]] could have prevailed in the case based on a different claim were he disposed to lie. To be effective, the logic underlying the migu must be impeccable and there are a variety of cases in which the Migu argument is invalid.

==Example of an effective Migu==

One classic example of where a Migu does work is in the area of a [[loan]] repayment dispute. Where the [[lender]] accuses an alleged borrower of [[default (law)|default]]ing on an oral loan made without witnesses, the borrower may prevail in the case by claiming that the loan did occur, but that it had already been repaid. Normally, when one makes a claim that a loan has been repaid, he would be expected to produce evidence that it had been repaid, such as a [[receipt]]. However, in this scenario the borrower would prevail under the theory that he must be telling the truth, as if he were interested in lying to the court, he could have simply said that the loan never happened. Since the lender cannot prove the existence of the loan, that claim would have prevailed. Therefore, the claim that the loan was repaid is believed as well. This is a classic Migu, although many cases of Migu exist to support a position in court.

Other cases in which Migu is invoked are cases in which witnesses might have a personal gain in testifying, which would normally disqualify the testimony. If another option can be found for the witnesses to achieve the same personal gain, some authorities rule that the testimony can be accepted.

==Exceptions to the rule==
There are exceptions to the rule of Migu, perhaps the most common one is known as "Migu in the place of witnesses" (Hebrew מיגו במקום עדים). This takes on two meanings. The first is that in a case in which the claimant has irrefutable proof - such as valid witnesses -  supporting his claim, the litigant cannot use Migu as a defense. The reasoning is that the witnesses are "stronger" than the Migu. (This means that in the order of acceptance of proofs and logic the court of law will rule based on the stronger proof/logic.) A second meaning to "Migu in the place of witnesses" is similar yet very different from the first. That is, when witnesses support the alternative claim, thereby destroying the litigant's position, as the litigant can no longer claim that if he was looking to win dishonestly he/she would have claimed the alternative. Because the alternative is no longer possible. This exception is true even if the witnesses bear testimony after the litigant made his/her claim. (see Rabbi Busel On Migu)

Another exception would be if the proposed alternative claim is considered to be an embarrassment to the defendant. Cases that would qualify are, if the story being told is embarrassing by its very nature, it is a highly unlikely story and a person would not be so brazen as to make the alternative claim (Hebrew, מיגו דהעזה לא אמרינן) or it is well known that the particular proposed fact is untrue, even if the claimant can't prove it. The logic behind this exception is elementary. The Migu lends credibility to the defendant by asking the question: "if he is lying in an effort to exempt himself from paying his dues, he should have told more believable lie". If the court can find a probable reason why he would avoid telling the harder-to-disprove story, then the entire logic falls apart.

A third rule in the non acception of Migu's is that "a Migu to extract is not said" (Hebrew מיגו להוציא לא אמרינן).&lt;ref&gt;Tosafis to Talmud, Baba metzia 2b&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;First Tosafis to Talmud, Bava Basra 32b&lt;/ref&gt; This means that the logic of Migu will not be excepted on the claimants side. ("Why did he claim that the item used to belong to the possessing party and that he had bought it from him, he could have said that the item never belonged to the possessing party?"). The predominant reason for this is that the burden of proof is on the claimant (Hebrew המוציא מחבירו עליו הראיה) and therefore even though a defendant can avoid payment using the Migu as a defense, it is not sufficient proof for the claimant. Another point is that this would open endless opportunities for con men (Many Jewish laws are designed to make con games more difficult)This is the opinion of the Tosafists.The Ramban among other Rishonim disagree with this rule and contend that it is a valid reasoning. Some explain that the root of the question lays in understanding Migu's properties as a tool in court. The Tosafists felt that a Migu is a leverage tool (Hebrew, כח הטענה), meaning that if a person chose to make a less favorable claim over a more favorable one, he is given the benefit of the doubt, although he is not necessarily believed based on his Migu, therefore his Migu can only deflect charges but not charge others. The Ramban on the other hand felt that Migu provides proof of the legitimacy of the claim, it can therefore be used as an attack tool.

==Rabbi Busel on Migu==
According to Rabbi Betzalel Busel there exists a fourth exception to the rule of Migu, and that is a stipulation that the potential claim be an alternative to the current claim and not an additional claim. ("I could have said something else instead", not "I could have added another point".) The reasoning given is that avoidinDHKH whereas giving an alternative claim gives the claim itself credence, and for a Migu to be effective it must be a boost for the claim and not for the person. (There is no rule to believe a more trustworthy person over a less trustworthy one, even though there is reason to believe one over the other.&lt;ref&gt;See Tosafis to Zevachim 103a&lt;/ref&gt;) This goes against the ruling of many leading commentators.&lt;ref&gt;Shaar Mishpat&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ramban to Baba Basra 30a&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rashba ibid.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rabbi Busel provides a rule of thumb in regards to Migu: No Migu can accomplish more than the alternative claim on which the Migu is based.&lt;ref&gt;Chidushi Harim&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rabbi Akivah Eiger to Baba Basra 31a&lt;/ref&gt; The logic is that it would be unseemly to base the value of a claim on an alternative one and thereby give the actual claim greater power than the alternative. Also in most cases the greater power that the Migu has would be a logical reason for a dishonest litigant to make the Migu claim, which would in effect disqualify the Migu itself. (In most cases the Migu claim is in place of a claim that would be effective without a Migu, which is generally favored over a claim that requires a Migu to uphold it. In addition, a Migu is not completely believed; it is no more that a law that the Migu claim must be accepted by the court.) This explains why witnesses who come after the Migu claim is invoked and accepted, disqualify the Migu, even though the logic still exists (the litigant had no idea that the witnesses would come, and still he chose to use the weaker claim), because since the alternate claim would have been rejected at this point, the Migu may no longer operate.

Rabbi Busel made a general point, that to disqualify a Migu, any gain that can be achieved by making the current claim over the alternate one will suffice to disqualify the Migu. This includes a gain that most people would not lie for, which means that even a gain that would not create doubt about a claim would disqualify the Migu.

'''Mydemocracy.ca''' is a public consultation commissioned by the [[Canadian federal government]]. It is intended to inform [[electoral reform]]. Replacing the existing [[first-past-the-post]] system with another [[voting system]], before the next election, was a [[Canadian federal election 2015|2015 election]] promise.&lt;ref name=natpost_dec6&gt;[http://news.nationalpost.com/news/canada/canadian-politics/exclusive-trudeau-government-to-mail-every-household-in-canada-questions-on-electoral-reform Exclusive: Trudeau government to mail every household in Canada questions on electoral reform | National Post&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Timeline==
The consultation was first reported publicly in early November 2016,&lt;ref name=natpost_dec6/&gt; with notices arriving by mail at the beginning of December. The survey was originally scheduled to end on December 30, but has since been extended to '''January 15, 2017'''.

A small pilot study (4,273 subjects) ran between October 23, 2016 and November 22, 2016.&lt;ref name=mydemocracy/&gt; The pilot study does not seem to have been [[trial registration|registered]] or reported.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

==Purpose==
A government official described the consultation as neither a referendum, a survey, nor a poll.&lt;ref name=natpost_dec6/&gt; The MyDemocracy.ca FAQ calls it "...more than just a survey. MyDemocracy.ca is a public engagement and education platform."&lt;ref name=mydemocracy&gt;https://www.MyDemocracy.ca&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been calls for a referendum, as [http://www.parl.gc.ca/HousePublications/Publication.aspx?DocId=8655791&amp;Language=E&amp;Mode=1&amp;Parl=42&amp;Ses=1&amp;File=408 recommended] in the [[Canadian House of Commons Special Committee on Electoral Reform]]'s [http://www.parl.gc.ca/Content/HOC/Committee/421/ERRE/Reports/RP8655791/421_ERRE_Rpt03_PDF/421_ERRE_Rpt03-e.pdf report].&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.nationalpost.com/news/canada/canadian-politics/house-of-commons-committee-recommends-referendum-on-electoral-reform Liberals call all-party electoral reform committee ‘radical’ and ‘hasty’ after it recommends referendum | National Post&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content==
The website does not ask direct questions about subjects' preferences for specific [[voting systems]]. Instead, it asks about preferences for [[Voting system#Evaluating voting systems using criteria|features of electoral systems]]. No one voting system can have all features, so it explicitly asks about trade-offs.

This approach has been criticized, particularly by proponents of proportional representation&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.nationalpost.com/news/canada/canadian-politics/dont-blame-electoral-reform-committee-for-ridiculous-survey-questions-enraged-mp-says Don’t blame electoral reform committee for ‘ridiculous’ survey questions, enraged MP says | National Post&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.nationalpost.com/full-comment/andrew-coyne-biggest-problem-with-mydemocracy-survey-is-the-questions Andrew Coyne: Biggest problem with MyDemocracy survey is the questions | National Post&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fairvote.ca/includepr/ Fair Vote Canada respectfully asks Minister Monsef to include questions about the principle of proportional representation on the Survey to Canadians], November 24, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;, with [[Fair Vote Canada]] publishing its own interpretations of the questions in terms of voting systems.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mycanadiandemocracy.ca/ This site will help you decipher the Government's new survey on electoral reform: the myths, the traps and the facts&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

MyDemocracy.ca uses answers to group the visitor into categories:

*Guardians
*Challengers
*Pragmatists
*Cooperators
*Innovators
&lt;ref name=global_crit/&gt;

These categories were derived from a [[pilot study]] of 4,273 Canadians over the age of 18.&lt;ref name=mydemocracy/&gt; [[Weighted mean|Weighted data]] from the pilot study was used to created these five categories:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Latent [[cluster analysis|clusters]] were identified using a finite [[mixture model]], where the number of [[component analysis (statistics)|components]] was determined through a dissimilarity-based partitioning method. The mixture model itself was defined such that all within-component [[covariance matrices]] were assumed to be [[diagonal matrix|diagonal]], meaning that the [eight] constitutive factors were assumed to be locally [[statistically independent|independent]]. Cluster variances were set to have equal shape, volume and orientation (an "EEI" model).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2333">The '''no-impeachment rule''' (also known as the '''non-impeachment rule''') is a rule in the [[procedural law]] of many jurisdictions. It says testimony from jurors about what occurred during [[jury deliberations]] may not be used to impeach a verdict during an [[appeal]]. The rule originated in [[common law]] and has been codified into statute in many jurisdictions.

==Definition==
The United States [[Federal Rules of Evidence]], section 606(b)&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/fre/rule_606 Federal Rules of Evidence Rule 606.] Legal Information Institute, Cornell School of Law&lt;/ref&gt; defines it as:

&lt;blockquote&gt;(1) Prohibited Testimony or Other Evidence. During an inquiry into the validity of a verdict or indictment, a juror may not testify about any statement made or incident that occurred during the jury deliberations; the effect of anything on that juror’s or another juror’s vote; or any juror’s mental processes concerning the verdict or indictment. The Court may not receive a juror’s affidavit of evidence of a juror’s statement on these matters.

(2) Exceptions. A juror may testify about whether:

    (A) extraneous prejudicial information was improperly brought to the jury’s attention;
    (B) an outside influence was improperly brought to bear on any juror; or
    (C) a mistake was made in entering the verdict on the verdict form.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Variations==
Under [[common law]], jurors were forbidden from impeaching their own verdict. Some states adopted a more limited version of the no-impeachment rule, known as the "Iowa rule" which "prevented jurors from testifying only about their own subjective beliefs, thoughts, or motives during  deliberations."&lt;ref name=Pena&gt;[https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/16pdf/15-606_886b.pdf Peña-Rodriguez v. Colorado]. United States Supreme Court&lt;/ref&gt;

==Localities==      
The Federal rule has been adopted into the law of 42 jurisdictions. The Iowa rule has been adopted in 9 jurisdictions.&lt;ref name=Pena/&gt;

==Exceptions== 
The [[United States Supreme Court]] created a [[racial bias]] exception to the rule in their decision in ''[[Peña-Rodriguez v. Colorado]]'' (2017).

The '''Parades Commission''' is a [[quasi-judicial body|quasi-judicial]] [[non-departmental public body]] responsible for placing restrictions on any [[parades in Northern Ireland]] it deems contentious or offensive. It is composed of seven members, all of whom are appointed by the [[Secretary of State for Northern Ireland]]. Restrictions it can impose include a prohibition on music being played, re-routing parades to avoid contentious areas, or banning certain participants based on previous breaches of its determinations. Its rulings are usually enforced by either parade stewards or the [[Police Service of Northern Ireland|police]], though there are disputes as to whether this is done to the [[letter and spirit of the law|letter of the law]] in certain areas. The Commission acts under the Public Processions (Northern Ireland) Act 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite legislation UK

Parade organisers and participants are liable to arrest and prosecution for breaching any of the Commission's rulings, although no-one has been charged since the Commission was established in 1998.{{citation needed|date=April 2011}} A section 6(7) offence has a maximum punishment of six months imprisonment or level five on the [[standard scale]].

The Commission was set up after the large-scale civil strife that followed the [[Drumcree conflict]] over an [[Orange Institution|Orange Order]] parade in [[Portadown]]. It has come under strong criticism from the Order. The Grand Lodge of the Order has a policy of non-engagement with the Commission, although some private and district lodges, particularly those with contentious parades, have agreed to talk to it.

'''Piratbyrån''' ({{IPA-sv|pɪ²rɑːtbʏˌroːn|lang|Piratbyrån-pronunciation.ogg}} "The Pirate Bureau") was a [[Sweden|Swedish]] organization (or [[think tank]]) established to support the free sharing of information, culture, and [[intellectual property]]. Piratbyrån provided a counterpoint to [[lobby group]]s such as the Swedish [[Svenska antipiratbyrån|Anti-Piracy Bureau]].

In 2005 Piratbyrån released an [[anthology]] entitled ''Copy Me'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | author=Piratbyrån | title=Copy Me - Samlade Texter Från Piratbyrån | year=2005 | language=Swedish | url=https://archive.org/details/CopyMeSamladeTexterFranPiratbyran}}&lt;/ref&gt; containing selected texts previously available from its website. Members of Piratbyrån participated in debates on Swedish Radio and Swedish Television and also gave several lectures in other European countries, such as at the 2005 22nd [[Chaos Communication Congress]] in Berlin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://piratbyran.org/index.php?view=articles&amp;id=107| title = Piratbyrån speech at Chaos Communication Congress 22C3 in Berlin|date=December 2005 |author=[[Palle Torsson]] and [[Rasmus Fleischer]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060206151626/http://www.piratbyran.org/index.php?view=articles&amp;id=107 |archivedate=6 February 2006 |accessdate=15 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Piratbyrån's activities might have changed over the years, partly as a result of the addition of the [[Pirate Party (Sweden)|Pirate Party]] to the Swedish political scene. During [[Walpurgis Night]] 2007, Piratbyrån burned all of their remaining copies of ''Copy Me'' in a ritual-like performance, declaring:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The file-sharing debate is hereby buried. When we talk about file-sharing from now on it's as one of many ways to copy. We talk about better and worse ways of indexing, archiving and copying—not whether copying is right or wrong. Winter is pouring down the hillside. Make way for spring!&lt;ref&gt;[http://piratbyran.org/walpurgis/ Walpurgis] Piratbyran. Retrieved 16 July 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Jonas Andersson, a Swedish researcher specialized in the politics of [[file-sharing]], gave this brief definition in October 2009:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Piratbyrån is entirely separate from The Pirate Party; it is more of a loosely organised think-tank, a website, a philosophical greenhouse or FAQ guide to digitization.&lt;ref&gt;Andersson, Jonas (13 October 2009). [http://liquidculture.wordpress.com/2009/10/13/qa-re-pirate-politics/ Q&amp;A re Pirate Politics] ''liquidculture notebook'' (Blog).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[MPAA]]-funded Svenska [[Svenska antipiratbyrån|Antipiratbyrån]] (Swedish Anti-Piracy Bureau), an agency devoted to fighting copyright infringement, was formed in 2001, before Piratbyrån. Piratbyrån humorously copied the name of their opponent, removing the "anti".&lt;ref name="torrentfreak-disband"&gt;Ernesto (23 June  2010).

In June 2010 the group disbanded following the death of co-founder and prominent member [[Ibrahim Botani]], also known as Ibi Kopimi Botani.&lt;ref name="torrentfreak-disband" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | first=Ibrahim | last=Botani | title=Untitled blog | website=Botanibladet | date=19 June 2008 | url=http://botanibladet.blogspot.nl/2008/06/botanibladets-ppnande.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several former members of Piratbyrån are now involved in [[Telecomix]]. The front page of the website was replaced with the three words {{lang|se|Stängt för eftertanke}} (Swedish for ''Closed for reflection'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.piratbyran.org/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2004-10-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041001003858/http://www.piratbyran.org/ |archivedate=2004-10-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Self-definition==
In 2008 Piratbyrån published a report titled ''Piratbyrån - The Bureau of Piracy Activities 2007''  which starts with the following description of the organisation:

{{quote|Piratbyrån (The Bureau of Piracy) is not an organization, at least not primarily. First and foremost, Piratbyrån is since its beginning in 2003 an ongoing conversation. We are reflecting over questions regarding copying, information infrastructure and digital culture. Within the group, using our own different experiences and skills, as in our daily encounters with other people. These conversations often bring about different kinds of activities.|&lt;ref name="piratbyran.org"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://piratbyran.org/PBverksamhet2007/PB%20activities%202007%20(text%20only).pdf|format=PDF| title = Piratbyrån – The Bureau of Piracy Activities 2007| year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Definition by Prix Ars Electronica jury==
As Piratbyrån received an "award of distinction" at [[Prix Ars Electronica]] in 2009,&lt;ref name="el-oso.net"&gt;oso (9 September 2009). [http://el-oso.net/blog/archives/2009/09/09/ars-electronica-digital-communities-forum/ |Ars Electronica| Communities Forum] El-Oso.net.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="aec.at"&gt;[http://www.aec.at/prix_history_en.php?year=2009 History of Prix Ars Electronica / 2009] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101025084014/http://aec.at/prix_history_en.php?year=2009 |date=2010-10-25 }} Ars Electronica, 2009. Retrieved 17 July 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; the jury statement said:

{{quote|Piratbyrån is not an organization but an on-going conversation on copyright, file-sharing and digital culture. Over the last six years Piratbyrån has been able to create a discursive space that enables individual and collective actors to be heard, and to significantly expand the range of opinions entering the public debate regarding copyright. To advance this conversation, they have been using a wide range of innovative, experimental, often humorous techniques – as well as traditional means such as public discussions, interviews and publications.

The resulting debate has been multi-layered ranging from the technological (e.g. The Pirate Bay) to the artistic (e.g. a bus tour through Europe to Manifesta 08) to the political (e.g. Pirate Party). With very limited resources, Piratbyrån has been able to galvanize a political movement that has already shaped the development of digital culture and public policy in Sweden and across Europe, pushing the boundaries of the possible.

Piratbyrån aims at nothing less than to fundamentally question the most basic categories – e.g. the distinction between the producer and the consumer – through which we understand culture in order to investigate if and how these apply to the digital condition.

Piratbyrån does not claim to offer a solution to this extremely complex issue; indeed, it questions the assumption that copyright offers a one-size-fits all solution to cultural production, which now needs to be replaced with another unified solution. All of this has been done with great dedication and under considerable personal risk, yet they never forget that humor and irony are among the strongest weapons available to cultural producers.|&lt;ref name="copyriot.se"&gt;Fleischer, Rasmus (17 September 2009).

[[Image:Rasmus Fleischer.jpg|right|thumb|[[Rasmus Fleischer]], spokesman of Piratbyrån speaking at a demonstration in [[Stockholm]] held 3 June 2006.]]
Members of Piratbyrån founded the [[BitTorrent (protocol)|BitTorrent]] tracker [[The Pirate Bay]] in 2003 as a Swedish language site. The Pirate Bay now operates independently from Piratbyrån, although a number of The Pirate Bay administrators were also active in Piratbyrån.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/science/discoveries/news/2006/03/70358 |last=Harrison |first=Ann |title=The Pirate Bay: Here to Stay? |publisher=Wired |date=13 March 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131031053808/http://www.wired.com/science/discoveries/news/2006/03/70358 |archivedate=31 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.slyck.com/story819_Slyck_Interviews_The_Pirate_Bay| last=Ingram | first=Michael | title=Slyck Interviews The Pirate Bay| publisher=[[Slyck.com]] |date=7 June 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Police raid===
On the morning of 31 May 2006, the servers of both [[The Pirate Bay]], a popular Swedish [[BitTorrent tracker]], and Piratbyrån were confiscated in a raid by Swedish police. The seizure was part of investigation into possible illegal activities on the part of The Pirate Bay. Piratbyrån and the Antipiratbyrån set up a temporary news blog during the investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://piratbyran.blogspot.com/| title = Piratbyrån Blog |accessdate=25 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.antipiratbyran.com/index.htm?id=news&amp;p=p19#19|title= Antipiratbyrån Blog|accessdate= 25 July 2008|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080806101720/http://www.antipiratbyran.com/index.htm?id=news&amp;p=p19#19|archivedate= 6 August 2008|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activities in 2007==
In ''Piratbyrån - The Bureau of Piracy Activities 2007'', published in 2008, Piratbyrån list its activities for the year 2007. Activities by Piratbyrån members include lectures at universities and conferences, the publication of reports, participation in art projects and research projects, an interview with [[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]] in February 2007, participation in the planning of [[The Oil of the 21st Century]] conference in Berlin, presentations at a Norwegian computer party (The Gathering), interviews to the media regarding the raid on [[The Pirate Bay]], opening of a webshop to sell Kopimi Klothing, participation in the organisation of protests to mark the one-year anniversary of the police raid on [[The Pirate Bay]], attendance of the BELEF07 festival in [[Belgrade]] ([[Serbia]]), and participation in the organisation of a one-day art event in [[Stockholm]] titled "Who Makes And Owns Your Work".&lt;ref name="piratbyran.org"/&gt;

In March 2007 Piratbyrån members were invited to a meeting with the executive group for the [[Swedish Film Institute]], to share their views about film and copying. According to Piratbyrån "The leadership listens with interest — only to some months later launch new anti-piracy initiatives...". In the same month Piratbyrån collaborates with the [[Norway|Norwegian]] group [[Piratgruppen]], launching the counter-campaign "Piracy frees music" (promoted via [[The Pirate Bay]]), in response to the "Piracy kills music" anti-piracy campaign by the Norwegian record industry.&lt;ref name="piratbyran.org"/&gt;

In 2007 members of Piratbyrån also contributed to the production of the film ''[[Steal This Film|Steal This Film (Part Two)]]'', which features interviews with Piratbyrån members and was released in December 2007.&lt;ref name="piratbyran.org"/&gt;

==Activities in 2009==
Piratbyrån organized the "Spectrial", a theatricalizing intervention in [[The Pirate Bay trial]] in Stockholm, early in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://trial.thepiratebay.org/ The Pirate Bay Trial website].  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090306020910/http://trial.thepiratebay.org/ |date=6 March 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

At the [[Prix Ars Electronica]] Piratbyrån received an "award of distinction" (including a prize money of 5000 euro) in the category "Digital Communities".&lt;ref name="el-oso.net"/&gt;&lt;ref name="aec.at"/&gt; The motivation of the jury underlined the Piratbyrån "never forget that humor and irony are among the strongest weapons available to cultural producers." &lt;ref name="copyriot.se"/&gt;

==Kopimi==
{{Multiple image

}}
The '''Kopimi''' symbol, also spelled '''kopimi''', was conceived in January 2005 by Piratbyrån co-founder [[Ibrahim Botani]]. The logo, pronounced "copy me", can be used to specifically request people to copy and distribute a work, for any purpose. Botani intended the logo to be the opposite of copyright, which usually restricts copying a work, and as a unifying symbol of the [[Opposition to copyright|anti-copyright]] ideas Piratbyrån stood for.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | first=Rasmus | last=Fleischer | title=Ibi Kopimi Botani | date=23 June 2010 | website=Copyriot | url=http://copyriot.se/2010/06/23/ibi-kopimi-botani/}}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, Kopimi may be considered an [[anti-copyright notice]] of sorts.

Later in 2005, the Kopimi logotype was included in the Piratbyrån book ''Copy Me''.&lt;ref&gt;Piratbyrån (2005). pp. 153, 154, 160, 164.&lt;/ref&gt; It was also put on the front page of [[The Pirate Bay]], where it remains until this day. The history section of the site stated: "''Some of you may have noticed that little symbol at the bottom of the page, the pyramid. It's a symbol called Kopimi (Copy Me) which was founded by an old friend of ours, the artist Ibi Botani. It's basically about promoting copying. Using the kopimi symbol on something not only shows that it is ok to copy it, it says it wants to be copied, mixed or manipulated!''"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | author=Unknown | title=History of 2007 | url=http://thepiratebay.org/history/2007 | website=thepiratebay.org | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090201011954/http://thepiratebay.org/history/2007 | archive-date=1 February 2009 | dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While Kopimi may appear to be a radical [[List of free content licenses|free content license]], in effect similar to [[Creative Commons license#Zero / public domain|Creative Commons Zero]], no one associated with Piratbyrån ever called Kopimi a license, instead describing it as a symbol of certain ideas. The website of Kopimi contains no terms or legal text. The [[Open Source Initiative]], [[Free Software Foundation]], or any other organisation within the [[open-source movement]], does not list Kopimi as an approved license.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | author=Open Source Initiative | title=Licenses by Name | website=Opensource.org | url=http://opensource.org/licenses/alphabetical}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | author=Free Software Foundation | title=Various Licenses and Comments about Them | website=gnu.org | url=https://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Wikimedia Commons]], a repository of free content and a sister site of Wikipedia, allows users to label their files with Kopimi.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | author=– | title=Pages that link to "Template:Kopimi" | website=Wikimedia Commons | url=https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:WhatLinksHere/Template:Kopimi&amp;hidelinks=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kopimism===
{{Main article|Missionary Church of Kopimism}}
'''Kopimism''' and '''kopimist(s)''' are terms derived from Botani's symbol. It is unclear who coined them, but they have been used since at least July 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | author=The Pirate Bay | title=TPB announces its support for ACFI against Ladonia | date=25 July 2006 | website=thepiratebay.org | url=http://thepiratebay.org/blog.php?id=34 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070323072858/http://thepiratebay.org/blog.php?id=34 | archivedate=23 March 2007 | dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | author=Unknown | title=How the Kopimists Conquered Internets – and Launched a War | date=25 July 2006 | website=Solidarity with Ladonia!

The Pirate Bay declared: "''To make sure the owners will be kopimistic and that the country won’t be governed by people that do not care about its future, we have come up with a plan. With the help of all the kopimists on Internets, we want to buy Sealand.''"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | author=The Pirate Bay | title=Buy Sealand | url=http://buysealand.com/ | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070126211851/http://buysealand.com/ | archivedate=2007-01-26 | dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | first=Tuan | last=Nguyen | title=PirateBay.org Wants to Be Own Country | website=[[DailyTech]] | url=http://www.dailytech.com/PirateBayorg+Wants+to+Be+Own+Country/article5692.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Missionary Church of Kopimism]] was founded in 2010 by Isak Gerson, a philosophy student and a member of the [[Pirate Party of Sweden]]. After two failed attempts, Kopimism was officially recognized as a religion by the Swedish government in January 2012. The Church considers copying a holy virtue, and uses various Kopimi symbols to present itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | author=Ernesto | title=File-sharing recognized as official religion in Sweden | date=4 January 2012 | website=[[TorrentFreak]] | url=https://torrentfreak.com/file-sharing-recognized-as-official-religion-in-sweden-120104/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | first=Rolle | last=Romig | title=The First Church of Pirate Bay | website=[[The New Yorker]] | date=12 January 2012 | url=http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/the-first-church-of-pirate-bay}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Copie===
[[File:Copie.svg|thumb|150px|Copie logo]]
Inspired by Kopimi, the [[Pirate Party of Brazil]] created their own version of the concept called "Copie", which plays both on the Portuguese words "copie" (meaning copy) and "co-pie" (meaning tweet together). The Copie logo shows 5 birds tweeting together.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.partidopirata.org/copie PartidoPirata] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090707074649/http://www.partidopirata.org/copie |date=2009-07-07 }} Brazilian Pirate Party website.

The '''Progressive Party''' of 1924 was a new party created as a vehicle for [[Robert M. La Follette, Sr.]] to run for president in the [[United States presidential election, 1924|1924 election]]. It did not run candidates for other offices, and it disappeared after the election. The party advocated [[progressivism in the United States|progressive]] positions such as government ownership of railroads and electric utilities, cheap credit for farmers, the outlawing of [[child labour|child labor]], stronger laws to help [[trade union|labor union]]s, more protection of civil liberties, an end to [[American imperialism]] in [[Latin America]], and a [[referendum]] before any president could lead the nation into war.

After winning election to the [[United States Senate]] in 1905, La Follette had emerged as a leader of progressives. He sought the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] presidential nomination in the [[United States presidential election, 1912|1912 election]], but many of his backers switched to [[Theodore Roosevelt]] after the former president entered the race. La Follette refused to join Roosevelt's [[Progressive Party (United States, 1912)|Progressive Party]], and that party collapsed after 1916. However, the progressives remained a potent force within both major parties. In 1924, La Follette and his followers created their own Progressive Party which challenged the conservative major party nominees, [[Calvin Coolidge]] of the Republican Party and [[John W. Davis]] of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]].

The Progressive Party was composed of La Follette supporters, who were distinguished from the earlier Roosevelt supporters by being generally more agrarian, populist, and midwestern in perspective, as opposed to urban, elite, and eastern. The party held a [[Nomination of Robert M. La Follette for President, 1924|national convention]] in July 1924 that nominated a ticket consisting of La Follette for president, and La Follete later selected Democratic Senator [[Burton K. Wheeler]] of [[Montana]] as his running mate. The ticket enjoyed support among many farmers and laborers and was endorsed by the [[Socialist Party of America]] and the [[American Federation of Labor]].

In the 1924 election, the party carried only La Follette's home state of [[Wisconsin]]. The ticket won 16.6% of the national popular vote and carried many counties in the Midwest and West with large [[German American]] elements or strong labor union movements.&lt;ref&gt;See: K.C. MacKay, ''The Progressive Movement of 1924.'' New York: Columbia University Press, 1947.&lt;/ref&gt; The party's share of the vote represents one of the best [[List of third party performances in United States presidential elections|performances by a third party]] in presidential election history. After the election, La Follette continued to serve as a Republican Senator until his death in 1925. After his death, La Follette's family founded the [[Wisconsin Progressive Party]] and briefly dominated Wisconsin politics.

Years before, La Follette had created the "Progressive" faction inside the [[Republican Party of Wisconsin]] in 1900.  In 1912 he attempted to create a [[Progressive Party (United States, 1912)|Progressive Party]] but lost control to [[Theodore Roosevelt]], who became his bitter enemy.&lt;ref&gt;Nancy Unger, ''Fighting Bob La Follette: The Righteous Reformer.'' Second edition. Madison: Wisconsin Historical Society Press, 2008; pp. 221-238.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1924 his new party (using the old 1912 name) called for public ownership of railroads, which catered to the [[Railroad brotherhoods]].  La Follette ran with Senator [[Burton K. Wheeler]], Democratic Senator from [[History of Montana|Montana]]. The party represented a farmer/labor coalition and was endorsed by the [[Socialist Party of America]], the [[American Federation of Labor]] and many railroad brotherhoods.  The party did not run candidates for other offices, and only carried one state, Wisconsin.  La Follette continued to serve in the Senate as a Republican until his death the following year, and was succeeded in a special election in 1925 by his son, [[Robert M. La Follette, Jr.]]&lt;ref&gt;Unger, ''Fighting Bob La Follette,'' pp. 281-303.&lt;/ref&gt;

The La Follette family continued his political legacy in Wisconsin, publishing ''[[The Progressive]]'' magazine and pushing for liberal reforms.  In 1934, La Follette's two sons began the [[Wisconsin Progressive Party]], which briefly held power in the state and was for some time one of the state's major parties, often ahead of the Democrats.&lt;ref&gt;Herbert F. Margulies; ''The Decline of the Progressive Movement in Wisconsin, 1890-1920.'' (State Historical Society of Wisconsin, 1968.)&lt;/ref&gt;

== California Progressives ==

[[Hiram W. Johnson]], backed by suffragette and early feminist [[Katherine Philips Edson]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Braitman|first=Jacqueline R.|title=A California Stateswoman: The Public Career of Katherine Philips Edson|jstor=25158366|work=California History|pages=82–95|date=June 1986}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a candidate for California governor in 1910, the Progressive Party vice presidential nominee in 1912, and was reelected as [[Governor of California]] on the Progressive ticket in [[California gubernatorial election, 1914|1914]]. In 1916, he was elected as a Progressive to the U.S. Senate and continued his affiliation with the state party throughout his decades in the Senate, while simultaneously winning the Republican nomination.  While Johnson was personally close to Theodore Roosevelt, he was much closer ideologically to Robert La Follette.  Johnson sat out the general election in 1924 after unsuccessfully challenging President [[Calvin Coolidge]] for the Republican nomination. Johnson personally disliked La Follette but grudgingly admired his quixotic third-party bid and generally agreed with his 1924 platform.&lt;ref&gt;See: George E. Mowry, ''The California Progressives.'' (1963).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1934, when the La Follettes founded the [[Wisconsin Progressive Party]], the [[California Progressive Party]] obtained a ballot line in California and ran seven candidates (all unsuccessful, although [[Raymond L. Haight]] got 13% of the vote for [[Governor of California]], running as a moderate against socialist and Democratic nominee [[Upton Sinclair]]). In 1936 they elected  [[Franck R. Havenner]] as [[United States House of Representatives|Congressman]] for [[California's 4th congressional district]], and garnered a significant portion of the votes in some other races.

Havenner became a Democrat before the 1938 race; Haight defeated eventual winner [[Culbert Olson]] in the Progressive primary election, but received only 2.43% of the vote in the general election as a Progressive; and by the time of the 1942 gubernatorial election, the Progressives were no longer on the California ballot. By 1944, Haight was again a Republican, a delegate to the [[1944 Republican National Convention|Republican National Convention]].&lt;ref&gt;Kevin Starr, ''Endangered Dreams: The Great Depression in California.''

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11161">A '''public access file''' (sometimes capitalized as '''Public Access File''', sometimes abbreviated as '''PAF''', and also called a '''public examination file''') is a file that needs to be maintained by any United States employer hiring people in [[H-1B visa|H-1B]], [[H-1B1 visa|H-1B1]], or [[E-3 visa|E-3]] temporary nonimmigrant worker statuses. It is intended to include more background information related to the attestations made on the [[Labor Condition Application]] used for the [[Form I-129]] and/or visa application that was used to acquire the nonimmigrant worker status. The file may be requested by any member of the public through telephone or email inquiries, that should be responded to within 3 business days. It is distinguished from a private access file that contains more sensitive and confidential employee data that must be shared with the [[U.S. Department of Labor]] if they choose to investigate. Regulations governing the public access file can be found in the [[Code of Federal Regulations]], Title 20 (Employee Benefits), or more specifically, in 20 CFR 655.760&lt;ref name=cfr&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/20/655.760|title = 20 CFR 655.760 - What records are to be made available to the public, and what records are to be retained?|publisher = [[Code of Federal Regulations]] (mirrored on the website of the [[Legal Information Institute]])}}&lt;/ref&gt; (note that that section does not itself use the term "public access file" but other sections that refer to it refer to it with that name).&lt;ref name=cfr-h-1b-dependent-willful&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/20/655.736|title = 20 CFR 655.736 - What are H-1B-dependent employers and willful violators?|publisher = [[Code of Federal Regulations]] (mirrored on the website of the [[Legal Information Institute]])|accessdate = June 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Contents of the file ==

We use the term "public access file" to refer to all the records associated with a specific LCA. In other words, to each LCA, there is one associated public access file, and different LCAs have different public access files. This holds even though much of the content of these files overlaps.&lt;ref name=cfr/&gt;

=== The Labor Condition Application itself ===

For LCAs submitted by paper, a copy of the certified LCA (Form ETA 9035E or Form ETA 9035) and cover pages (Form ETA 9035CP) must be included. If the LCA is submitted electronically, a printout of the certified application, signed by the employer, needs to be included.&lt;ref name=cfr/&gt;&lt;ref name=dol-summary&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.dol.gov/whd/immigration/h1bprsnt.ppt|title = The Employment of Non-immigrants on H-1B Visas (PPT)|publisher = [[United States Department of Labor]]|accessdate = June 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Background information on the attestations made ===

The goal of the public access file is to provide more information explaining the basis of the attestations made in the [[Labor Condition Application]]. Below, we go over the list of the attestations made and any information that must be included in the public access file for those attestations.

==== Attestation #1: Wages ====

In the LCA, the employer must specify the wage that the non-immigrant worker(s) being hired via the LCA will be paid, and attest that the non-immigrant workers on behalf of whom the application is being made will be paid at or above both these numbers:

* The '''actual wage''': This is the wage paid to other employees in the company who do the same work.
* The [[prevailing wage]]: This is the wage for that occupation in the geographical area of intended employment.

The employer must make similar attestation regarding non-wage benefits offered.

The public access file must contain four pieces of information relevant to the wage attestations:&lt;ref name=cfr/&gt;&lt;ref name=dol-summary/&gt;

* Documentation of the wage rate being paid to the non-immigrant worker(s).
* A full, clear explanation of the system the employer used to set the "actual wage" the employer has paid or will pay workers in the occupation for which the non-immigrant worker(s) is/are being sought. This should also include information on any periodic increases that the system may provide, such as a memorandum summarizing the employer's pay system or scale. Payroll records are not required in the ''public'' access file, but may be demanded by the Department of Labor in an audit.
* A full, clear explanation of the system the employer used to set the "prevailing wage" for the occupation in the intended area of employment. A general description of the source and methodolofy suffices. The underlying individual wage data relied upon is not a matter of public record, but may be demanded by the Department of Labor in an audit.
* A summary of benefits offered, as well as a statement on how differentiation in benefits is made when not all employees are offered or receive the same benefits. Where applicable, a statement that some/all of the non-immigrant workers are receiving home country benefits.&lt;ref name=cfr/&gt;&lt;ref name=cfr-lca-1&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/20/655.731#c_3|title = 20 CFR 655.731 - What is the first LCA requirement, regarding wages?|accessdate = June 12, 2016|publisher = [[Code of Federal Regulations]] (mirrored on the [[Legal Information Institute]] website)}}&lt;/ref&gt; The clause on benefits, along with the exception for home country benefits, was introduced as part of the [[American Competitiveness in the 21st Century Act]].

==== Attestation #2: Working conditions ====

In the LCA, the employer must attest that the hiring of non-immigrant workers will not adversely affect the working conditions of similarly employed workers at the company, and that the non-immigrant workers will be offered similar working conditions as native US workers. The official regulations on the public access file do not mention any information that needs to be included regarding working conditions.&lt;ref name=cfr/&gt;

==== Attestation #3: Strike, lockout, or work stoppage ====

In the LCA, the employer must attest that on the day the application is filed, there is not a strike, lockout, or work stoppage in the named occupation at the place of employment and that, if such a strike, lockout, or work stoppage occurs after the application is submitted, the employer will notify ETA within three (3) days of such occurrence and the application will not be used to file a work authorization petition until the ETA has determined that the work stoppage has ceased.

The official regulations on the public access file do not mention any information that needs to be included regarding strikes, lockouts, or work stoppages.&lt;ref name=cfr/&gt;

==== Attestation #4: Notice ====

In the LCA, the employer must attest that as of the date of application, notice of the application has been or will be provided both to workers within the company in the said application. Also, the (prospective) workers on whose behalf the application is filed must be provided a copy of the application.

The public access file must include proof of satisfying union/employee notification requirements.&lt;ref name=cfr/&gt;&lt;ref name=cfr-lca-4&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/20/655.734|title = 20 CFR 655.734 - What is the fourth LCA requirement, regarding notice?|accessdate = June 12, 2016|publisher = [[Code of Federal Regulations]] (mirrored on the [[Legal Information Institute]] website)}}&lt;/ref&gt; For non-union positions this means the posting notice.&lt;ref name=dol-summary/&gt;&lt;ref name=cfr-lca-4/&gt;

The employer must maintain additional evidence that the LCA was posted for at least ten business days (about two weeks) in two conspicuous locations. This evidence need only be included in the private access file.

=== Requirements surrounding change in corporate structure ===

When the employer undergoes a change in corporate structure, the public access file must be amended to include a sworn statement by a responsible official of the new employing entity that it accepts all obligations, liabilities and undertakings under the LCAs filed by the predecessor employing entity, together with a list of each affected LCA and its date of certification, and a description of the actual wage system and FEIN of the new employing entity.&lt;ref name=cfr/&gt;&lt;ref name=dol-summary/&gt;

=== Requirements relevant to H-1B-dependent employers and willful violators ===

The following are relevant to [[H-1B-dependent employer|H-1B-dependency]]. Employers who are H-1B-dependent, or who come close to being H-1B-dependent, may have some of these apply:&lt;ref name=cfr/&gt;&lt;ref name=cfr-h-1b-dependent-willful/&gt;&lt;ref name=dol-summary/&gt;

* Where the employer utilizes the definition of "single employer" in the IRC, a list of any entities included as part of the single employer in making the determination as to its H-1B-dependency status.
* Where the employer is H-1B-dependent and/or a willful violator, and indicates on the LCA(s) that only "exempt" H-1B nonimmigrants will be employed, a list of such "exempt" H-1B nonimmigrants.
* Where the employer is H-1B-dependent or a willful violator, a summary of the recruitment methods used and the time frames of recruitment of U.S. workers (or copies of pertinent documents showing this information). This helps provide substantiation of the additional attestations regarding recruitment and hiring that H-1B-dependent employers and willful violators need to make.

== Retention requirements ==

The PAF must be kept as long as the worker is employed in a status that depends on the corresponding LCA, and for one year after the worker is no longer in that status with the company. This one-year requirement pertains only to public access files; payroll records (that need to be maintained privately for a Department of Labor audit) need to be maintained for three years since the payment was made.&lt;ref name=cfr/&gt;

== Compliance burden and penalties ==

The employer must provide the public access file of any employee to any member of the public who requests it by phone or email. The turnaround time should be not more than three business days of the request. Failure to provide the public access file is, in and of itself, considered a compliance failure, regardless of whether there was any intent to deceive or inaccuracies in LCA attestations. However, as the [[H-1B Visa Reform Act of 2004]] clarifies, violations will not be cited in case of good faith efforts to comply, if records are corrected within 10 days, and there is no general pattern of willful violations.&lt;ref name=dol-summary/&gt;

It is generally advised not to include any information in the public access file beyond that mandated by law, since additional information can compromise the privacy of employees and of the company. The additional information that may be demanded in an audit, such as payroll records, full details of wage calculations and H-1B dependency calculations, and evidence of duration of notice posting, needs to be maintained in a private access file.

== Platform ==
The Qivicon platform has been around in the German market since the fall of 2013. It connects and combines controllable devices made by different manufacturers. Every partner company can market their product offer of its own and develop apps to control them. To date, the product portfolio consists of devices such as motion detectors, smoke detectors, water detectors, wireless adapters for power outlets, door and window contact, temperature and humidity sensors, wireless switches, carbon monoxide sensors, thermostats, cameras, household appliances (e. g. washing machines, dryers, coffee machines), weather stations, sound systems and lighting controls.&lt;ref&gt;Qivicon. [https://www.qivicon.com/assets/Products/Uploads/QIVICON-Kompatibilitaetsliste.pdf ''List of compatible products'']. qivicon.com. 18.07.2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

The platform’s technical control unit, its home base, is connected to the Internet via a broadband connection in the house or apartment.&lt;ref&gt;''Das Haus wird intelligent.'' Ratgeber bauen: Traumhäuser. 31.03.2014.&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2016, Qivicon launched a new generation of the home base focusing on international markets. The range of different models will keep up with the diverse range of wireless protocols found throughout the international market. The models all have an identical outward appearance. But they differ in terms of their pre-installed protocols. For example, the model designed for the German market, and several other markets, already includes the protocols HomeMatic, ZigBee Pro and the inclusion of HomeMatic IP and DECT ULE has also been completed. Another model includes the ZigBee Pro and Z-Wave radio modules. All versions of the new home base can be connected to home DSL routers either by cable, wirelessly, via Wi-Fi or via Deutsche Telekom´s Speedport Smart router.&lt;ref&gt;QIVICON growing – new markets, new partner offers [https://www.telekom.com/en/media/media-information/enterprise-solutions/qivicon-growing---new-markets--new-partner-offers-436236 ''QIVICON growing – new markets, new partner offers'']. 22.08.2016&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.iot-now.com/2017/05/25/62360-speedport-now-controls-deutsche-telekoms-end-user-offering-making-1-2-million-smart-routers-every-year/|title=Speedport to now control Deutsche Telekom’s end-user offering - IoT Now - How to run an IoT enabled business|date=2017-05-25|work=IoT Now - How to run an IoT enabled business|access-date=2018-07-26|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2187">'''''Qimron v. Shanks''''', (2000) is a landmark ruling by the [[Israeli Supreme Court]]. The Court ruled that an Israeli scholar had a copyright on his reconstruction of an important [[Dead Sea Scrolls|Dead Sea Scroll]] and that his right had been violated by an unauthorized early publication of his work.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/08/31/world/israeli-court-upholds-scholar-s-rights-to-dead-sea-scrolls-work.html|title=Israeli Court Upholds Scholar's Rights to Dead Sea Scrolls Work|last=Greenberg|first=Joel|date=2000-08-31|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-05-15|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
More than eight-hundred scrolls, including the oldest known copies of [[Old Testament]] books, are thought to have been written between the second century B.C. and A.D. 70 were discovered in 1947 near the [[Dead Sea]] in caves at [[Qumran Caves|Qumran]] on the [[West Bank]]. 

Thereafter they were held at a museum in [[East Jerusalem]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=MacQueen|first=Hector L.|date=2010-10-28|title=The Scrolls and the Legal Definition of Authorship|url=http://www.oxfordhandbooks.com/view/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199207237.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780199207237-e-31|language=en|doi=10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199207237.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780199207237-e-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1967, the museum came under Israeli control following the [[Six-Day War|Six‐Day War]] between [[Israel]], [[Egypt]], [[Jordan]] and [[Syria]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; While this brought the work on the scrolls under the auspices of the [[Israel Antiquities Authority|Israeli Antiquities Authority]], this did not otherwise affect the work of an international team of scholars who had been appointed in 1953/54 to transcribe, edit, and publish the fragments found in Cave 4 at Qumran. It did however lead to resentment from scholars outside the team who were denied any access to the unpublished scrolls.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Ruling ==
It was the first in which [[copyright law]] had been applied in court to a reconstruction of an ancient document.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''''SS Kalibia v Wilson''''',&lt;ref name=Kalibia&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|77|1970|litigants=SS Kalibia v Wilson |parallelcite=[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1910/77.pdf (1910) 11 {{abbr|CLR|Commonwealth Law Reports}} 689] |courtname=[[High Court of Australia|High Court]]}}.&lt;/ref&gt; was the first decision of the [[High Court of Australia]] on the extent of the power of the [[Parliament of Australia|Australian Parliament]] to make laws about shipping and navigation, including the [[Admiralty jurisdiction]] of the High Court. The High Court held that the power was limited to overseas and interstate trade and commerce. There was no separate power about navigation and shipping.&lt;ref name="ALRC"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Allsop 2007"/&gt;

==Background==
===The Constitution===
[[Section 51 of the Constitution of Australia|Section 51 of the Constitution]] provides that the Australian Parliament has the power to make laws with respect to:
:(i)  trade and commerce with other countries, and among the States;&lt;ref name="s51"&gt;{{Cite Legislation AU|Cth|act|coaca430|Constitution|51}} Legislative powers of the Parliament.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Section 98 of the Constitution of Australia|Section 98 of the Constitution]] then provides that 
: The power of the Parliament to make laws with respect to trade and commerce extends to navigation and shipping, and to railways the property of any State.&lt;ref name="s98"&gt;{{Cite Legislation AU|Cth|act|coaca430|Constitution|98}} Trade and commerce includes navigation and State railways.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Parliament can also make laws conferring [[Section 76 of the Constitution of Australia|original jurisdiction on the High Court]] in any matter of Admiralty and maritime jurisdiction.&lt;ref name="s76"&gt;{{Cite Legislation AU|Cth|act|coaca430|Constitution|76}} Additional original jurisdiction.&lt;/ref&gt;

The early drafts of the Constitution gave the Australian parliament power to make laws with respect to "navigation and shipping" as a separate head of power under section 51. In 1898 the drafting committee made two relevant changes, to remove shipping and navigation to section 98 and to make it a part of the trade and commerce power in section 51(1). It is not apparent from the debates why this was done, nor was there any apparent consideration as to the effect of the change.&lt;ref name="3 Mar 98"&gt;{{cite web |title=Official Record of the Debates of the Australasian Federal Convention, Melbourne, 3 March 1898 |url=http://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/search/display/display.w3p;query=Id%3A%22constitution%2Fconventions%2F1898-1121%22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="16 Mar 98"&gt;{{cite web |title=Official Record of the Debates of the Australasian Federal Convention, Melbourne, 16 March 1898 |url=http://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/search/display/display.w3p;query=Id%3A%22constitution%2Fconventions%2F1898-1129%22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Allsop 2007"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Allsop |first1=James |author-link1=James Allsop |title=Australian Admiralty and Maritime Law – sources and future directions |url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/journals/UQLawJl/2007/10.pdf}} (2007) 26 University of Queensland Law Journal 179.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Seamen's Compensation Act===
The ''Seamen's Compensation Act'' was a uniform law that applied to all seamen on Australian registered ships and to Australian seamen on British and foreign ships engaged in the Australian [[coasting trade]]. The coasting trade was defined as carrying cargo from one port in Australia to another, even if those ports were in the same State.&lt;ref name=Act&gt;{{Cite Legislation AU|Cth|num_act|sca1909291909249|Seamen's Compensation Act 1909}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite hansard |jurisdiction=Commonwealth of Australia |house=Senate |title=Seamen's Compensation Bill |url=http://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/download/hansard80/hansards80/1909-07-21/toc_pdf/19090721_senate_3_50.pdf |date=21 July 1909 |page_start=1405 |page_end=1413 |speaker=[[Edward Millen]] |position=[[Vice-President of the Executive Council]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite hansard |jurisdiction=Commonwealth of Australia |house=House of Representatives |title=Seamen's Compensation Bill |url=http://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/download/hansard80/hansardr80/1909-12-03/toc_pdf/19091203_reps_3_54.pdf |date=3 December 1909 |page_start=6930 |page_end=6931 |speaker=[[Paddy Glynn]] |position=[[Attorney-General for Australia|Attorney-General]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because the [[Section 51(i) of the Constitution of Australia|trade and commerce power]] is limited to overseas and inter-state trade, there needed to be some other head of federal power to support its validity in providing for intrastate trade. The Commonwealth argued this power was found in sections 76(iii) and 98 of the Constitution.&lt;ref&gt;The argument referred to {{cite book |last1=Moore |first=W H |author-link1=William Harrison Moore |title=The constitution of the commonwealth of Australia |edition=2nd |year=1910 |url=https://archive.org/details/constitutionofco00moor |page=560}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Facts===

The [[SS Kalibia (1902)|Kalibia]] was a British [[Ship registration|flagged]] [[screw steamer]] (SS) owned by the [[Clyde Shipping Company]] of Glasgow, that in 1909 had been chartered to carry cargo from New York to Australia, offloading cargo at Adelaide, Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane. The [[Chief mate|first officer]] agreed to transport a small package from Adelaide to Brisbane that had been mistakenly offloaded from another cargo ship. It was alleged that the SS Kalibia had taken horses from Melbourne to Brisbane, but this was later agreed to be wrong.

In Melbourne the crew, described as [[Lascars]], deserted the ship, complaining of being ill-treated and underfed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article10849666 |title=Kalibia's Lascars refuse to rejoin vessel |newspaper=[[The Argus (Melbourne)|The Argus]] |date=16 April 1910 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; On arrival in Sydney the men were charged with combining to disobey lawful commands and were sentenced to imprisonment for 6 weeks, being the time the vessel would be absent from Sydney, at the end of which they would be placed on the vessel for the homeward journey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article15136833 |title=Trouble on the Kalibia |newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |date=26 April 1910 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The crew were replaced for the voyage to Brisbane by an Australia crew, including Alexander Wilson.  Wilson was seriously injured on 29 April 1910 when he was knocked into the [[hold (ship)|vessel's hold]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article19632722 |title=Accident to a Seaman |newspaper=[[The Brisbane Courier]] |date=2 May 1910 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; He applied to the [[Supreme Court of New South Wales|Supreme Court of NSW]] for an order that the ship be detained until a security bond was paid to cover any compensation that might be awarded to Wilson. [[Philip Whistler Street|Justice Street]] made an order in the absence of the owners of the SS Kalibia ([[Ex parte#Australia|ex parte]]). The owners sought to have the order set aside however Justice Gordon refused, holding that there was some evidence that the ship was engaged in the coasting trade and whether this was correct was a matter to be determined at trial. If the ship was permitted to depart Australia without providing security then Wilson would have no recourse.&lt;ref&gt;''In re Wilson'' (1910) 27 [[Weekly Notes (New South Wales)|WN (NSW)]] 73, [[Supreme Court of New South Wales|Supreme Court (NSW)]].&lt;/ref&gt; The security was subsequently set by consent at £500.

==The High Court==

===Nature of the order===
It was argued for Wilson that the order of Street J was "ministerial" rather than judicial and as such Gordon J had no jurisdiction to discharge the order and there was no appeal to the High Court. Griffith CJ was the only judge to deal with this argument in detail, holding that a power conferred upon a judicial officer was judicial unless there were "clear words to show that it was dictatorial and unappealable". It was an elementary rule of justice that a party affected by an ex-parte order could apply to have the order discharged.

===The coasting trade===
Wilson had been engaged in Australia on a British ship, the critical point for the success of his application was whether the Kalibia was engaged in the coasting trade which required loading cargo in one Australian port to be unloaded at another. The only thing taken on board in Australia was the small case carried by the first officer as a favour for a shipping agent. Griffith CJ held that the essence of trade was a contract of carriage made on behalf of the ship and the case was therefore not cargo.&lt;ref name=Kalibia/&gt;{{rp|p. 696}} Barton J similarly held that gratuitous carriage was not sufficient and that trading in this context connoted payment for freight.&lt;ref name=Kalibia/&gt;{{rp|p. 700}} O'Connor J held that the isolated transaction had no trace of trade or business and was not conducted with the authority of the owners.&lt;ref name=Kalibia/&gt;{{rp|p. 706}} Isaacs J also held that the captain had no apparent authority to engage in the coasting trade.&lt;ref name=Kalibia/&gt;{{rp|p. 711}}

===The Act was unconstitutional===
The court's finding that the Kalibia was not engaged in the coasting trade meant it was unnecessary to decide the constitutional validity of the Act, and the Court would not normally do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|64|1908|link=Attorney-General for NSW v Brewery Employees Union of NSW |litigants=Union Label case |parallelcite=[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1908/94.pdf (1908) 6 {{abbr|CLR|Commonwealth Law Reports}} 469] |courtname=[[High Court of Australia|High Court]]}} at pp. 491–492 per Griffith CJ and pp. 553–554 per Isaacs J.&lt;/ref&gt; On this occasion however each of the judges felt it was appropriate to express their opinion on the validity of the Act. albeit Higgins J did so with considerable reservation. One objection was that compensation for seamen did not fall within trade and commerce.  None of the judges determined this objection. Each of the judges held that by including all coasting trade in Australia, including intrastate trade, the Act went beyond the Commonwealth power. Section 98 of the constitution explained the meaning of "trade and commence" and did not remove the need for such trade to be "with other countries, and among the States". There are echoes of the [[reserved powers doctrine]] in the judgments of Griffiths CJ, Barton and O'Connor JJ however their judgments were not based on it. Isaacs and Higgins JJ, who steadfastly rejected the reserved powers doctrine, similarly found that there was no constitutional power to regulate shipping and navigation within the limits of a State.

Where the judges differed was in applying the test from the decided cases,&lt;ref name="Railway servants"&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|94|1906|litigants=Railway servants case |link=Federated Amalgamated Government Railway &amp; Tramway Service Association v NSW Rail Traffic Employees Association |parallelcite=[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1906/94.pdf (1906) 4 {{abbr|CLR|Commonwealth Law Reports}} 488] |courtname=[[High Court of Australia|High Court]]}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="No 2"&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|33|1910|litigants=Whybrows case (No 2) |link=Australian Boot Trade Employees' Federation v Whybrow &amp; Co#R v Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration; Ex parte Whybrow &amp; Co (No 2) |parallelcite=[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1910/33.pdf (1910) 11 {{abbr|CLR|Commonwealth Law Reports}} 1] |courtname=[[High Court of Australia|High Court]]}}.&lt;/ref&gt; whether the invalid provisions could be severed. Griffith CJ held that the Act intended to apply to all ships engaged in the coasting trade without distinction and that the provisions could not therefore be severed.&lt;ref name=Kalibia/&gt;{{rp|p. 699}} Barton J held that the definition of coasting trade was unambiguous and it was not the role of the Court to re-write the definition to make it constitutional.&lt;ref name=Kalibia/&gt;{{rp|p. 702}} O'Connor J held that the provisions of the Act could not be separated, such that the entire Act was invalid.&lt;ref name=Kalibia/&gt;{{rp|p. 708}} Isaacs J held that Parliament had made no distinction between inter-State and intra-State trade and that the enactment was therefore invalid.&lt;ref name=Kalibia/&gt;{{rp|p. 715}}

Higgins J dissented on the question of severability. His Honour had no doubt the Parliament intended the Act to apply to the coasting trade within the limits of a State, but that if Parliament had understood the limits of its power, the Act would have been limited to inter-State seamen.&lt;ref name=Kalibia/&gt;{{rp|pp. 721–2}}

===s76(iii)===
The Commonwealth argued that the Act was a valid exercise of power under section 76(iii) of the Constitution, asserting that "the Parliament may make laws in any matter of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction". That is that the power to give the High Court jurisdiction with respect to admiralty and maritime matters implied a power on the part of the Commonwealth tho legislate as to those matters. Griffith CJ described the argument as quite untenable.&lt;ref name=Kalibia/&gt;{{rp|p. 699}} Barton J held that this was a matter in which the over-riding power on the subject was the Parliament of the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name=Kalibia/&gt;{{rp|pp. 703–4}} Isaacs J noted that section 76 related solely to Parliament conferring original jurisdiction on the High Court. His Honour distinguished between the interpretation and enforcement of admiralty and maritime
law and the alteration of that law.&lt;ref name=Kalibia/&gt;{{rp|p. 715}}

==Aftermath==
The effect of the decision was that the Australian Parliament did not have power to alter maritime law or to deal with maritime affairs other than by reliance upon the heads of power in s 51, importantly (but not solely) the trade and commerce power.&lt;ref name=Samson&gt;{{cite AustLII|FCAFC|182|2014|litigants=Samson Maritime Pty Ltd v Aucote |parallelcite=(2014) 229 [[Federal Court Reports|FCR]] 125 |pinpoint=[34] |courtname=[[Federal Court of Australia|Federal Court (Full Court)]]}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The decision has never been over-turned by the High Court, however doubts have been expressed about the legitimacy of the High Court's decision, with Higgins J describing the views on the reach of s 76(iii) expressed by Griffiths CJ, Barton and Isaacs JJ as [[Obiter dicta|obiter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|15|1927|litigants=R v Turner; Ex parte Marine Board of Hobart |parallelcite=[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1927/15.pdf (1927) 39 {{abbr|CLR|Commonwealth Law Reports}} 411] at pp 447–8 |courtname=[[High Court of Australia|High Court]]}}.&lt;/ref&gt; More recently [[William Gummow|Justice Gummow]], then sitting in the [[Federal Court of Australia|Federal Court]], noted that Barton J's reasoning that Australia was not, in 1910, a "separated nation of independent sovereignty in its relation to the United Kingdom" no longer represented the modern constitutional position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|FCA|499|1991|litigants=Re Empire Shipping Company Inc v the Owners of the Ship "Shin Kobe Maru" |parallelcite=(1991) 32 [[Federal Court Reports|FCR]] 78 at pp 86–7 |courtname=[[Federal Court of Australia|Federal Court]]}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

A replacement ''Seamen's Compensation Act'' was passed in 1911, which was limited in its application to ships engaged in trade and commerce with other countries or among the States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Legislation AU|Cth|num_act|sca191113o1911268|Seamen's Compensation Act 1911}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1911 Act was challenged in ''[[Australian Steamships Ltd v Malcolm]]'' on the basis that compensation for seamen did not fall within trade and commerce. The majority, Isaacs, Gavan Duffy, Powers and Rich JJ (Griffith CJ &amp; Barton J dissenting) held that the Act was a valid exercise of the trade and commerce power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|FCA|73|1914|litigants=[[Australian Steamships Ltd v Malcolm]] |parallelcite=[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1914/73.pdf (1914) 19 {{abbr|CLR|Commonwealth Law Reports}} 298] |courtname=[[High Court of Australia|High Court]]}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''Navigation Act'' 1912 (Cth) the Parliament sought to overcome the question of severability by the inclusion of a provision that the Act was to be "construed subject to the Constitution, and so as not to exceed the legislative power of the Commonwealth"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Legislation AU|Cth|num_act|na19124o1913169|Navigation Act 1912}}&lt;/ref&gt; a provision that, in 1930, would be added to the [[Acts Interpretation Act 1901|''Acts Interpretation Act'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Legislation AU|Cth|act|aia1901230|Acts Interpretation Act|15A}} Construction of Acts to be subject to Constitution.&lt;/ref&gt; There are limitations to the effectiveness of such an approach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.opc.gov.au/about/docs/drafting_series/DD3.1.pdf |title=Drafting Direction No. 3.1 Constitutional law issues |publisher=Office of Parliamentary Counsel (Cth) |date=January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Australian Law Reform Commission]] was asked to review all aspects of the Admiralty jurisdiction in Australia and chapter 5 of its report looked at both the history of the jurisdiction in Australia and made various recommendations for change, including the use of other constitutional heads of power as the foundation for Australian legislation. The report noted that the High Court had held in the [[New South Wales v Commonwealth (1975)|Sea and Submerged lands case]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|58|1975|litigants=NSW v Commonwealth ('Seas and Submerged Lands case) |link=New South Wales v Commonwealth (1975) |parallelcite=(1975) 135 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 337 |courtname=[[High Court of Australia|High Court]]}}.&lt;/ref&gt; that the territory of the States stopped at the low-water mark or at the line closing a bay, such that the [[Section 51(xxix) of the Constitution of Australia|external affairs power]] would permit the Parliament to make laws about ships voyaging from one port in Australia to another, even if those ports were in the same State.&lt;ref name="ALRC"&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[Australian Law Reform Commission]] |title=Civil Admiralty Jurisdiction |url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/other/lawreform/ALRC/1986/33.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Parliament subsequently enacted the ''Seafarers Rehabilitation and Compensation Act'' 1992 which relied upon additional heads of power, including the [[Section 51(xx) of the Constitution of Australia|corporations power]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Legislation AU|Cth|act|sraca1992381|Seafarers Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014 a Full Court of the Federal Court held that this meant the Act was effective in regulating the rights of employees of a trading corporation who worked on a vessel that was working in an area confined to the seas off Western Australia. The Court held it was unnecessary to decide the complex questions, arising from the decision in ''SS Kalibia v Wilson''  around whether the employer's business dealings were such that the ship was engaged in overseas or interstate trade or commerce.&lt;ref name=Samson/&gt;

===The referendums===
The [[Australian Labor Party|Labor Party]] twice held [[Referendums in Australia|referendums]] to consider proposed changes to the Constitution to overcome the decision of the High Court by removing the limitation on the trade and commerce power to be with other countries or among the States. Neither referendum was successful.

{{Campaignbox Indo-Pakistani Wars}}

The '''Simla Agreement''' (or Shimla Agreement) was signed between [[India]] and [[Pakistan]] on 2 July 1972 in [[Shimla|Simla]], the capital city of the Indian state of [[Himachal Pradesh]].&lt;ref name=MEA_site&gt;{{cite web|title=Simla Agreement|url=http://www.mea.gov.in/bilateral-documents.htm?dtl/5541/Simla+Agreement|work=Bilateral/Multilateral Documents|publisher=Ministry of External Affairs, Government of India|accessdate=27 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It followed from the [[Bangladesh Liberation War|Bangladesh Liberation war in 1971]] that led to the independence of [[Bangladesh]], which was earlier known as [[East Pakistan]] and was part of the territory of Pakistan. India entered the war as an ally of Bangladesh which transformed the war into an [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1971]]. The agreement was ratified by the Parliaments of both the nations in same year.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

The agreement was the result of resolve of both the countries to "put an end to the conflict and confrontation that have hitherto marred their relations". It conceived the steps to be taken for further normalisation of mutual relations and it also laid down the principles that should govern their future relations.&lt;ref name=IBN_40&gt;{{cite web|title=Indo-Pak Shimla Agreement: 40 years later |url=http://ibnlive.in.com/news/indopak-shimla-agreement-40-years-later/268913-3.html|work=IANS|publisher=IBN Live, CNN IBN|accessdate=27 September 2013|date=2 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this was not respected and aggression continued on both sides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chagla|first1=M.C.|title=Roses in December|publisher=Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan|location=Bombay}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Details of the Simla agreement ==
The treaty was signed in [[Shimla|Simla]], [[India]], by [[Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto]], the [[President of Pakistan]], and [[Indira Gandhi]], the [[Prime Minister of India]]. The agreement also paved the way for diplomatic recognition of [[Bangladesh]] by [[Pakistan]]. Technically the document was signed on 0040 hours in the night of 3 July, despite this official documents are dated 2 July 1972.&lt;ref name=IBN_40 /&gt;&lt;ref name=KSG&gt;{{cite web|title=Relevance of Simla Agreement|url=http://ksgindia.com/study-material/editorial-series/3885-relevance-of-simla-agreement.html|work=Editorial Series|publisher=Khan Study Group|accessdate=27 September 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131002132702/http://ksgindia.com/study-material/editorial-series/3885-relevance-of-simla-agreement.html|archivedate=2 October 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Few major outcomes of the Simla Agreement are:

: Both countries will "settle their differences by peaceful means through bilateral negotiations".&lt;ref name=MEA_site /&gt;&lt;ref name=Pradhanmantri&gt;{{cite episode |title=1971 Indo-Pak War |series=Pradhanmantri |date=21 September 2013 |url=http://www.newsbullet.in/video/india/45558-watch-pradhanmantri-episode-11-about-1971-indo-pak-war |network=ABP News |season=1 |number=11 |last=Kapur |first=Shekhar (Narrator)}}&lt;/ref&gt; India has, many a times, maintained that Kashmir dispute is a bilateral issue and must be settled through bilateral negotiations as per Simla Agreement, 1972 and thus, had denied any third party intervention even that of United Nations.&lt;ref name=IE&gt;{{cite web|title=India spikes Pak call for third party mediation, says Simla Agreement tops all agendas|url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/india-spikes-pak-call-for-third-party-mediation-says-simla-agreement-tops-all-agendas/1063018/0|publisher=Indian Express|accessdate=27 September 2013|author=Press Trust of India|date=22 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

: The agreement converted the cease-fire line of 17 December 1971 into the [[Line of Control]] (LOC) between India and Pakistan and it was agreed that "neither side shall seek to alter it unilaterally, irrespective of mutual differences and legal interpretations".&lt;ref name=MEA_site /&gt;&lt;ref name=KSG /&gt; Many Indian bureaucrats have later argued that a tacit agreement, to convert this LOC into international border, was reached during a one-on-one meeting between the two heads of government. However, Pakistani bureaucrats have denied any such thing.&lt;ref name=IBN_40/&gt;&lt;ref name=KSG/&gt; This identification of a new "cease-fire line" by both the states has been argued by India as making [[United Nations Military Observer Group in India and Pakistan]] insignificant. As according to India, the purpose of UNMOGIP was to monitor the cease-fire line as identified in [[Karachi Agreement|Karachi agreement of 1949]] which no longer exists. However, Pakistan have a different take on this issue and both countries still host the UN mission.&lt;ref name=IE&gt;{{cite web|title=India spikes Pak call for third party mediation, says Simla Agreement tops all agendas|url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/india-spikes-pak-call-for-third-party-mediation-says-simla-agreement-tops-all-agendas/1063018/0|publisher=Indian Express|accessdate=27 September 2013|author=Press Trust of India|date=22 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The agreement has not prevented the relationship between the two countries from deteriorating to the point of armed conflict, most recently in the [[Kargil War]] of 1999. In [[Operation Meghdoot]] of 1984 India seized all of the inhospitable [[Siachen Glacier]] region where the frontier had been clearly not defined in the agreement (possibly as the area was thought too barren to be controversial), this was considered as a violation of the Simla Agreement by Pakistan. Most of the subsequent deaths in the [[Siachen Conflict]] have been from natural disasters, e.g. avalanches in 2010, [[2012 Siachen Glacier avalanche|2012]] and [[2016 Siachen Glacier avalanche|2016]].

Simla Agreement on Bilateral Relations between India and Pakistan signed by Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, and President of Pakistan, [[Z. A. Bhutto]], in Simla on 2 July 1972.

{{quotation|
The [[Government of India]] and the [[Government of Pakistan]] are resolved that the two countries put an end to the conflict and confrontation that have hitherto marred their relations and work for the promotion of a friendly and harmonious relationship and the establishment of durable peace in the subcontinent so that both countries may henceforth devote their resources and energies to the pressing task of advancing the welfare of their people.  
&lt;p&gt;
In order to achieve this objective, the Government of India and the Government of Pakistan have agreed as follows:  
&lt;p&gt;
(i) That the principles and purposes of the Charter of the United Nations shall govern the relations between the two countries.  
&lt;p&gt;
(ii) That the two countries are resolved to settle their differences by peaceful means through bilateral negotiations or by any other peaceful means mutually agreed upon between them. Pending the final settlement of any of the problems between the two countries, neither side shall unilaterally alter the situation and both shall prevent the organization, assistance or encouragement of any acts detrimental to the maintenance of peace and harmonious relations.  
&lt;p&gt;
(iii) That the prerequisite for reconciliation, good neighborliness and durable peace between them is a commitment by both the countries to peaceful coexistence respect for each others territorial integrity and sovereignty and noninterference in each others internal affairs, on the basis of equality and mutual benefit. That the basic issues and causes of conflict which have bedeviled the relations between the two countries for the last 25 years shall be resolved by peaceful means.  
&lt;p&gt;
(v) That they shall always respect each others national unity, territorial integrity, political independence and sovereign equality.  
&lt;p&gt;
(vi) That in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations, they will refrain from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of each other. 
&lt;p&gt;
Both governments will take all steps within their power to prevent hostile propaganda directed against each other. Both countries will encourage the dissemination of such information as would promote the development of friendly relations between them.  
&lt;p&gt;
In order progressively to restore and normalize relations between the two countries step by step, it was agreed that:  
&lt;p&gt;
(i) Steps shall be taken to resume communications, postal, telegraphic, sea, land, including border posts, and air links, including over flights.  
&lt;p&gt;
(ii) Appropriate steps shall be taken to promote travel facilities for the nationals of the other country.  
&lt;p&gt;
(iii) Trade and cooperation in economic and other agreed fields will be resumed as far as possible.  
&lt;p&gt;
(iv) Exchange in the fields of science and culture will be promoted. 
&lt;p&gt;
In this connection delegations from the two countries will meet from time to time to work out the necessary details.  
&lt;p&gt;
In order to initiate the process of the establishment of durable peace, both the governments agree that:  
&lt;p&gt;
(i) Indian and Pakistani forces shall be withdrawn to their side of the [[international border]].  
&lt;p&gt;
(ii) In [[Jammu and Kashmir]], the line of control resulting from the ceasefire of December 17, 1971, shall be respected by both sides without prejudice to the recognized position of either side. Neither side shall seek to alter it unilaterally, irrespective of mutual differences and legal interpretations. Both sides further undertake to refrain from the threat or the use of force in violation of this line.  
&lt;p&gt;
(iii) The withdrawals shall commence upon entry into force of this agreement and shall be completed within a period of 30 days thereof. 
&lt;p&gt;
This agreement will be subject to ratification by both countries in accordance with their respective constitutional procedures, and will come into force with effect from the date on which the instruments of ratification are exchanged.  
&lt;p&gt;
Both governments agree that their respective heads will meet again at a mutually convenient time in the future and that in the meanwhile the representatives of the two sides will meet to discuss further the modalities and arrangements for the establishment of durable peace and normalization of relations, including the questions of repatriation of prisoners of war and civilian internees, a final settlement of Jammu and Kashmir and the resumption of diplomatic relations.

'''Soldier Field''' is an [[American football]] stadium located in the [[Near South Side, Chicago|Near South Side]] of [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]]. It opened in 1924 and is the home field of the [[Chicago Bears]] of the [[National Football League]] (NFL), who moved there in [[1971 Chicago Bears season|1971]].&lt;ref name=sold71ct&gt;{{cite news |url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1971/05/14/page/55/article/bears-find-home-its-soldier-field |newspaper=Chicago Tribune |last=Rollow |first=Cooper |title=Bears find home; it's Soldier Field |date=March 14, 1971 |page=1, part 3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mjstpsf&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=8ksaAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=fygEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7322%2C1745759 |newspaper=Milwaukee Journal |title=Bears sign to play in Soldier Field |date=March 14, 1971 |page=21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The stadium's interior was mostly demolished and rebuilt as part of a major renovation project in 2002, which modernized the facility but lowered seating capacity, while also causing it to be delisted as a [[National Historic Landmark]]. Soldier Field has served as the home venue for a number of other sports teams in its history, including the [[History of the Chicago Cardinals|Chicago Cardinals]] of the NFL, [[Notre Dame Fighting Irish football|University of Notre Dame football]], and the [[Chicago Fire Soccer Club|Chicago Fire]] of [[Major League Soccer]], as well as games from the [[1994 FIFA World Cup]], the [[1999 FIFA Women's World Cup]], and multiple [[CONCACAF Gold Cup]] championships. In 1968, it hosted the first Games of the [[Special Olympics]]. With a football capacity of 61,500, it is the [[List of current National Football League stadiums|third-smallest stadium in the NFL]].

In [[2016 Chicago Bears season|2016]], Soldier Field became the second-oldest stadium in the league when the [[Los Angeles Rams]] began playing temporarily at the [[Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum]], which opened a year earlier than Soldier Field.

==History==
[[File:Child,Mother,Father,MilitaryFamily.jpg |thumb |left |upright |Sculpture of a sailor and his family, gazing eastward, over [[Lake Michigan]]]]
Soldier Field was designed in 1919 and opened on October 9, 1924, as Municipal Grant Park Stadium. The name was changed to Soldier Field on November 11, 1925, as a memorial to U.S. soldiers who had died in combat. Its formal dedication as Soldier Field was on Saturday, November 27, 1926,&lt;ref name=htthctr&gt;{{cite news |url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1926/11/27/page/1/article/110-000-to-see-game-today |newspaper=Chicago Daily Tribune |title=110,000 to see game today |date=November 27, 1926 |page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; during the 29th annual playing of the [[Army–Navy Game]].&lt;ref name="timeline"/&gt; Its design is in the [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassical]] style, with [[Doric order|Doric]] columns rising above the East and West entrances.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chicagoarchitecture.info/Building/1082/Soldier-Field.php "Soldier Field"], Chicago Architecture Info. Retrieved January 16, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; The stadium cost $13 million to construct ($182 million in 2015 dollars), a very large sum for a sporting venue at that time (in comparison, L.A. Memorial Coliseum had cost less than $1 million in 1923 dollars).

===Early configuration===
In its earliest configuration, Soldier Field was capable of seating 74,280 spectators and was in the shape of a U. Additional seating could be added along the interior field, upper promenades and on the large, open field and terrace beyond the north endzone,&lt;ref name=chisun46&gt;{{cite news |url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1946/04/07/page/10/ |newspaper=Chicago Sunday Tribune |title=Truman telss Chicago crowd U.S. must remain strong |date=April 7, 1946 |page=10, part 1}}&lt;/ref&gt; bringing the [[seating capacity]] to over 100,000.&lt;ref name=cmachsfd&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=voVWAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=OuYDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1516%2C7547180 |newspaper=Sydney Morning Herald |location=Australia |agency=(photo)|title=Closing meeting at Chicago's Soldier Field |date=November 25, 1962 |page=64 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chicago Bears move in===
Soldier Field was used as a site for many sporting events and exhibitions. The [[1959 Chicago Cardinals season|Chicago Cardinals]] used it as their home field for their final season in Chicago in [[1959 Chicago Cardinals season|1959]]. A dozen years later in September {{nfly|1971}}, the [[1971 Chicago Bears season|Chicago Bears]] moved in, originally with a three-year commitment.&lt;ref name=sold71ct/&gt;&lt;ref name=mjstpsf/&gt; They previously played at [[Wrigley Field]], best known as the home of the [[Chicago Cubs]] baseball team, but were forced to move to a larger venue due to post-[[AFL–NFL merger]] policies requiring that stadium capacities seat over 50,000 spectators. They had intended to build a stadium in [[Arlington Heights, Illinois|Arlington Heights]]. In 1978, the Bears and the [[Chicago Park District]] agreed to a 20-year lease and renovation of the stadium. Both parties pooled their resources for the renovation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lugardo|first=Sara|url=http://chicago.cbslocal.com/2012/12/16/history-of-tailgating-in-chicago/|title=History of Tailgating in Chicago|publisher=[[WBBM-TV]]|date=2012-12-16|accessdate=2012-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The playing surface was [[AstroTurf]] from 1971 through 1987, replaced with natural grass in [[1988 Chicago Bears season|1988]].&lt;ref name=bgasfmbmv&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=19FKAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=w-kMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=962%2C3903968 |newspaper=Schenectady Gazette |location=New York |agency=Associated Press |title=Bears' games at Soldier Field may be moved |date=August 16, 1988 |page=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Replacement talks===
In 1989, Soldier Field's future was in jeopardy after a proposal was created for a "McDome", which was intended to be a domed stadium for the Bears, but was rejected by the [[Illinois Legislature]] in 1990. Because of this, Bears president [[Michael McCaskey]] considered relocation as a possible factor for a new stadium. The Bears had also purchased options in [[Hoffman Estates]], [[Elk Grove Village]], and [[Aurora, Illinois|Aurora]]. In 1995, McCaskey announced that he and Northwest Indiana developers agreed to construction of an entertainment complex called "Planet Park", which would also include a new stadium. However, the plan was rejected by the Lake County Council, and in 1998, Chicago mayor [[Richard M. Daley]] proposed that the Bears share [[Comiskey Park II|Comiskey Park]] with the [[Chicago White Sox]].&lt;ref name=BearsHistory&gt;{{cite web|last=Taylor|first=Roy|url=http://www.bearshistory.com/lore/soldierfieldhistory.aspx|title=Soldier Field History|publisher=Bearshistory.com|accessdate=July 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Renovation and landmark delisting===

[[File:Soldier-Field-01.jpg |thumb|left |Soldier Field as seen from Lake Shore Drive. The modern grandstands, added in 2003, extend well above the original Neoclassical columns.]]

Beginning in [[1978 Chicago Bears season|1978]], the plank seating was replaced by individual seats with backs and armrests. In 1982, a new press box as well as 60 skyboxes were added to the stadium, boosting capacity to 66,030. In 1988, 56 more skyboxes were added increasing capacity to 66,946. Capacity was slightly increased to 66,950 in 1992. By [[1994 NFL season|1994]], capacity was slightly reduced to 66,944. During the renovation, [[seating capacity]] was reduced to 55,701 by building a grandstand in the open end of the U shape. This moved the field closer to both ends at the expense of seating capacity. The goal of this renovation was to move the fans closer to the field.&lt;ref name="timeline"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagobears.com/tradition/soldier-field-history/historical-timeline.html|title=Historical timeline of Soldier Field|year=2009|publisher=Chicago Bears|accessdate=December 18, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222145306/http://www.chicagobears.com/tradition/soldier-field-history/historical-timeline.html|archive-date=December 22, 2015|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The front row 50-yard line seats were then now only {{convert|55|ft}} away from the sidelines, the shortest distance of all NFL stadiums, until [[MetLife Stadium]] opened in 2010, with a distance of 46 feet.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}

In 2001, the Chicago Park District, which owns the structure, faced substantial criticism when it announced plans to alter the stadium with a design by [[Benjamin T. Wood]] and Carlos Zapata of the Boston-based architecture firm Wood + Zapata. Stadium grounds were reconfigured by Chicago-based architecture firm of Lohan Associate, led by architect Dirk Lohan, the grandson of architect [[Ludwig Mies van der Rohe]]. The stadium's interior would be demolished and reconstructed while the exterior would be preserved. This is an example of [[facadism]]. A similar endeavor of constructing a new stadium within the confines of an historic stadium's exterior was completed in [[Leipzig]], Germany's [[Red Bull Arena (Leipzig)|Red Bull Arena]], which similarly build a modern stadium while persevering the exterior of the original [[Zentralstadion]].

On January 19, 2002, the night of the Bears playoff loss to the Philadelphia Eagles, demolition was begun as tailgate fires still burned in the trashcans in the parking lots. Removal of 24,000 stadium seats in 36 hours  by Archer Seating Clearinghouse, a speed record never exceeded since,  was the first step in building the new Soldier Field. Nostalgic Bears fans, recalling the glory seasons, especially 1985, along with some retired players picked up their seats in the South Parking lot.

The foremen on the job were Grant Wedding, who himself installed the seats in 1979,  and Mark Wretschko who was an executive for the factory who made the 1979 seats.

Dozens of articles by writers and columnists attacked the project as an aesthetic, political, and financial nightmare. The project received mixed reviews within the architecture community, including criticism by civic and preservation groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Chicago Journal; Soldier Field Renovation Brings Out Boo-Birds|first=David|last=Barboza|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/06/16/us/chicago-journal-soldier-field-renovation-brings-out-boo-birds.html|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=June 16, 2003|accessdate=September 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prominent American architect and Chicagoan [[Stanley Tigerman]] called it "a fiasco".&lt;ref name="field"&gt;{{cite news |title=Field of Pain|newspaper=[[Chicago Magazine]]|url=http://www.chicagomag.com/Chicago-Magazine/November-2002/Field-of-Pain/|first=Robert|last=Sharoff|date=November 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Chicago Tribune'' architecture critic [[Blair Kamin]] dubbed it the "Eyesore on the Lake Shore".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Soldier field plan: On further Review, the Play Stinks|last=Kamin|first=Blair|authorlink=Blair Kamin|newspaper=[[Chicago Tribune]]|date=April 5, 2001|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/chi-010405soldier,0,6775465.story|accessdate=February 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The Monstrosity of the Midway; Mr. Mayor: Stop the Madness and Admit That the Lakefront Is No Place for the Bears|last=Kamin|first=Blair|authorlink=Blair Kamin|newspaper=[[Chicago Tribune]]|date=June 11, 2001|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2001-06-11/features/0106110127_1_dirk-lohan-soldier-field-comiskey-park|accessdate=February 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=A tale of Hungry Bears and White Elephants|last=Kamin|first=Blair|authorlink=Blair Kamin|newspaper=[[Chicago Tribune]]|date=July 11, 2001|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2001-07-11/features/0107110020_1_comiskey-park-soldier-field-chicago-park-district|accessdate=February 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The renovation was described by some as "a spaceship landed on the stadium".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/football/bears/csac-bt-030914soldierfieldchapmancommentary,0,44019.story|title=A stadium deal that is hard to bear|last=Chapman|first=Steve|date=September 14, 2003|newspaper=[[Chicago Tribune]]|accessdate=May 21, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lohan responded,

&lt;blockquote&gt;I would never say that Soldier Field is an architectural landmark. Nobody has copied it; nobody has learned from it. People like it for nostalgic reasons. They remember the games and parades and [[tractor pull]]s and veterans' affairs they've seen there over the years. I wouldn't do this if it were the [[Parthenon]]. But this isn't the Parthenon.&lt;ref name=field/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Proponents argued the renovation was direly needed citing aging and cramped facilities. ''[[The New York Times]]'' ranked the renovated Soldier Field as one of the five best new buildings of 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/12/28/arts/architecture-the-highs-the-buildings-and-plans-of-the-year.html?scp=1&amp;sq=&amp;st=nyt|title=Architecture: The Highs; The Buildings (and Plans) of the Year|last=Muschamp|first=Herbert|date=December 23, 2003|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=May 21, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soldier Field was given an award in design excellence by the [[American Institute of Architects]] in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mayer|first=Larry|url=http://www.chicagobears.com/news/article-1/Soldier-Field-wins-prestigious-award/584E1290-7E72-4455-8A4E-3E67FB5D9764|title=Soldier Field wins prestigious award|publisher=[[Chicago Bears]]|accessdate=October 7, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131230231731/http://www.chicagobears.com/news/article-1/Soldier-Field-wins-prestigious-award/584E1290-7E72-4455-8A4E-3E67FB5D9764|archive-date=December 30, 2013|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 23, 2004, as a result of the 2003 renovation, a 10-member federal advisory committee unanimously recommended that Soldier Field be delisted as a [[National Historic Landmark]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://eculturalresources.com/news/787.html|title=Soldier Field loses National Historic Landmark status|date=April 24, 2006|work=General Cultural Resources News|publisher=eCulturalResources|accessdate=May 21, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.preservationnation.org/magazine/story-of-the-week/2006/leveling-the-playing-field.html|title=Leveling the Playing Field|last=Murray|first=Jeanne|date=October 20, 2006|work=Preservation Magazine|publisher=National Trust for Historic Preservation|accessdate=May 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The recommendation to delist was prepared by Carol Ahlgren, architectural historian at the National Park Service's Midwest Regional Office in [[Omaha, Nebraska]]. Ahlgren was quoted in Preservation Online as stating that "if we had let this stand, I believe it would have lowered the standard of National Historic Landmarks throughout the country", and, "If we want to keep the integrity of the program, let alone the landmarks, we really had no other recourse." The stadium lost the Landmark designation on February 17, 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nps.gov/history/nr/listings/20060428.HTM|title=Weekly List of Actions taken on properties: 4/17/06 through 4/21/06|date=April 28, 2006|work=National Register of Historic Places|publisher=National Park Service|accessdate=May 21, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2012, the stadium became the first NFL stadium to achieve [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design|LEED]] status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagobears.com/news/NewsStory.asp?story_id=8842|title=Soldier Field earns top building honor|publisher=Chicago Bears|date=May 31, 2012|accessdate=July 24, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120625103306/http://www.chicagobears.com/news/NewsStory.asp?story_id=8842|archive-date=June 25, 2012|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:The Army-Navy football game at Soldier's Field (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|400px|1926 Army–Navy Game]]

*The stadium hosted its first football game, on October 4, 1924, between [[Louisville Male High School]] and Chicago's [[Austin Community Academy High School]]. Louisville's team won 26–0. ([[Chicago Tribune]], October 2, 1924)
*Over 100,000 spectators attended the 1926 [[Army–Navy Game]]. It would decide the national championship, as [[1926 Navy Midshipmen football team|Navy]] entered undefeated and [[1926 Army Cadets football team|Army]] had lost only to Notre Dame. The game lived up to its hype, and even though it ended in a 21–21 tie, Navy was awarded the national championship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usna.edu/LibExhibits/Archives/Armynavy/An1926.htm |title=1926 Army-Navy Game |date=November 26, 2001 |work=Library Archives |publisher=United States Naval Academy |accessdate=May 21, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090114060018/http://www.usna.edu/LibExhibits/Archives/Armynavy/An1926.htm |archivedate=January 14, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Austin defeated Leo to win the 1937 Prep Bowl; another contender for the highest attendance ever (estimated at over 120,000 spectators). The Chicago Prep Bowl games are held at Soldier Field yearly on the day after Thanksgiving. The bowl game is older than the [[Illinois High School Association|IHSA]] state championship tournament held since the 1960s.
*The stadium was host to 41 [[College All-Star Game]]s, an exhibition between the previous year's NFL champion (or, in its final years, [[Super Bowl]] champion) and a team of collegiate all-star players prior to their reporting to their new professional teams training camps. This game was discontinued after the [[1976 NFL season]]. The final game in 1976 was halted in the third quarter when a torrential thunderstorm broke out and play was never resumed.
*In 2012, [[2012 Notre Dame Fighting Irish football team|Notre Dame]] hosted a game at Soldier Field against the [[2012 Miami Hurricanes football team|University of Miami]] as part of their [[Shamrock Series]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="29515">[[File:Tennessee Walker X-Ray.jpg|thumb|X-ray image of a "performance package" on a Tennessee Walking Horse, showing shoe, "stacks"- multiple pads, multiple extra nails placed in pads to add weight and possibly pressure (known as "pressure soring") and band across hoof to hold it all on]]
'''Soring''' is the use of chemicals, pressure or devices to cause pain to the front feet and legs of horses when they touch the ground.  This results in the horses picking up their front feet higher and faster than they would do naturally.  It is an [[Cruelty to animals|abusive]] and prohibited practice, illegal in the U.S. under the [[Horse Protection Act of 1970]] (HPA).  It is closely associated with a unique high-stepping action of the front legs called "big lick" movement in [[horse show|show ring]]  [[Tennessee Walking Horse]]s.  Under normal circumstances, "big lick" action is normally created by [[horseshoe]]s that have added pads and weight (sometimes called "stacks"), usually combined with additional weighted chains or rollers placed around the [[pastern]]s to create dramatic, high-stepping flashy action of the horse's front legs, desired in the [[horse show]] ring.  Practitioners of soring do so because they believe that the pain associated with this practice exaggerates the "big lick" to a greater degree and gives them a competitive edge over horses that are not treated in this manner.  Other breeds that have a history of soring abuses include the [[Racking Horse]] and the [[Spotted Saddle Horse]]. Both criminal and civil penalties can be assessed against individuals who engage in soring.

==History==
During the late 1940s and early 1950s, when Tennessee Walking Horses enjoyed a surge of widespread popularity with the general public, exaggerated front leg action, especially at the running walk, drew spectators to [[horse show]]s and helped increase the popularity of the breed.  This action was also rewarded by judges.  This began the rage for "big lick" movement. While "lite shod" horses with naturally good movement could comfortably perform this crowd-pleasing gait at the time, it took both natural ability and considerable time to properly train and condition the horse.

Some individuals, wishing to produce similar movement in less-talented horses or in less time, borrowed practices used by other breeds to enhance movement. This included action devices such as weighted shoes, "stacks" (stacked pads), and the use of weighted chains around the pasterns, all of which, within certain limits, were allowed.

As these methods produced horses that won in the show ring, and as ever-higher and more dramatic action was rewarded by the judges, some trainers turned to less savory methods to produce high action in a hurry. These methods include excessively heavy weighted chains, use of tacks deliberately placed under the shoe into the "white line," or [[Hyponychium|quick]], of the [[horse hoof|hoof]], trimming the sole of the hoof to the point that it bleeds or is bruised, increasing the weight of the stacked pads by driving in a large number of concealed nails and the controversial practice of "soring", which is the application of a caustic chemical agent to the pastern of the front legs to cause pain when the chains bang against the pastern with every step. The outcome of these practices is so much pain in the horse's front hooves that the horse snatches its feet off the ground as fast as possible in an attempt to alleviate the pain. Correspondingly, the horse steps under itself as far as possible with its hind legs to relieve the forelegs of weight. This results in the "squatting" body outline (hindquarters extremely lowered, forelegs flung very high) typical of the "big lick" horse. Such abuses are illegal under the Horse Protection Act of 1970, but are still practiced.

Measures have been taken to stop the practice, and many supporters of the Tennessee Walking Horse have organized to oppose soring. The HPA,&lt;ref name="HPA2016"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/ourfocus/animalwelfare/sa_hpa/ct_hpa_reg_sections |title=Horse Protection Act and Regulations|publisher=US Department of Agriculture|date=March 2016|accessdate=March 31, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; created specifically to stop such practices and to monitor the Tennessee Walking Horse in particular, prohibits the use of soring agents. The [[Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service]] (APHIS), part of the USDA, is working with the industry to enforce the law. Tennessee Walking Horse organizations send designated qualified persons (DQPs) to shows to inspect the horses, and, as funding permits, APHIS sends federally employed veterinary medical officers to work with DQPs at some shows.

Trainers who oppose soring have formed and joined alternative breed organizations, including the National Walking Horse Association (NWHA) and Friends of Sound Horses (FOSH). All of these organizations promote the sound Tennessee Walking Horse.  In addition, in 2005, the national directors of the [[Tennessee Walking Horse Breeders' and Exhibitors' Association]] (TWHBEA) voted to remove themselves from the National Horse Show Commission (NHSC), the sanctioning body closest to the soring issues. The TWHBEA formed its own sanctioning body, developed a new rule book and strict guidelines for affiliated horse shows and Horse Industry Organizations [HIO] that applied and were examined by the APHIS. The issue remains very controversial, particularly in  Kentucky and Tennessee.

==Methods and clinical signs==
Soring has been declared "cruel" and "inhumane" by the [[United States Congress]].&lt;ref name="HPA text"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/USCODE-2001-title15/pdf/USCODE-2001-title15-chap44-sec1822.pdf|title=Horse Protection Act §15 USC 1821-1831}}{{usc|15|1821}} et. seq&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the  [[American Veterinary Medical Association]] (AVMA) has described it as  "inhumane"&lt;ref name="AVMAtestimony"&gt;{{cite web|title=AVMA CEO testimony on the Prevent All Soring Tactics Act: 2013|accessdate=April 4, 2016|publisher=American Veterinary Medical Association|url=https://www.avma.org/News/PressRoom/Pages/testimony-dehaven-111313.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "unethical".&lt;ref name="AVMASoring"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.avma.org/kb/resources/reference/animalwelfare/pages/soring-horses.aspx|publisher=American Veterinary Medical Association|accessdate=April 4, 2016|title=Soring horses: Unethical practice making horses suffer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The legal definition of soring in the Horse Protection Act of 1970 is:

&lt;blockquote&gt;(A) an irritating or blistering agent has been applied, internally or externally, by a person to any limb of a horse, &lt;br&gt;(B) any burn, cut, or laceration has been inflicted by a person on any limb of a horse, &lt;br&gt;(C) any tack, nail, screw, or chemical agent has been injected by a person into or used by a person on any limb of a horse, or &lt;br&gt;(D) any other substance or device has been used by a person on any limb of a horse or a person has engaged in a practice involving a horse, and, as a result of such application, infliction, injection, use, or practice, such horse suffers, or can reasonably be expected to suffer, physical pain or distress, inflammation, or lameness when walking.&lt;ref name="USC1821"&gt;{{cite web|title=15 U.S. Code § 1821 - Definitions|accessdate=April 1, 2016|publisher=Cornell University Law School|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/15/1821}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Clinical signs of a sored horse include:
* The horse stands with its feet close together, shifting its weight to its hind legs.
* Granulation tissue or scars are visible on the pasterns or coronet band.
* Wavy hair growth or hair loss is visible in the pastern area.
* The horse's pasterns have darker hair than the rest of the horse's coat.
* The horse carries its hocks low and may twist them outward when moving.
* The horse lies down for extended periods of time, and is resistant to standing up.
* The horse resists handling of its hooves.
* The horse has difficulty walking, and may fall.

===Chemical soring and pressure shoeing===
One method of soring involves using chemical agents such as [[mustard oil]], [[kerosene]], and other caustic substances on the pasterns, bulbs of the heel, or coronary bands of the horses, causing burning or blistering of the horses' legs  to accentuate their gaits. [[Dimethyl sulfoxide]] (DMSO) is sometimes added to increase the effect. The treated area is then often wrapped in plastic while the chemicals are absorbed. The chemical agents cause extreme pain, and usually lead to [[scar]]ring. A distinctive scarring pattern is a characteristic indication of soring, so practitioners may attempt to disguise the scarring with a dye, or the horse's legs may be treated with [[salicylic acid]] to reduce scarring.  These chemicals are harmful, usually quite toxic, and sometimes [[carcinogen]]ic, such that practitioners must use a brush and wear gloves when applying them.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

Other methods of soring include pressure shoes, where the hoof is trimmed to the quick so that the sole is in direct contact with the pad or shoe.&lt;ref name="Wylie"/&gt; The horse may then be "road foundered", ridden up and down hard surfaces on the over-trimmed hooves, until they are very sore. Trainers sometimes place objects, such as metal beads, nails, or screws, under the pad, causing intense pressure, although this practice has begun to decrease with the use of fluoroscopy to detect such methods.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} Abusive use of chains (such as using them with chemical soring agents) is also a common practice.&lt;ref name="AVMA" /&gt;

===Action devices===
[[File:TWH with Stacks.jpg|thumb|Stacks are built-up pads between shoe and hoof, usually held on by a band over the front of the hoof.]]
"Action devices" include "stacks"—multiple pads between hoof and horseshoe; and "chains— bracelet-like chains or rollers placed around the [[pastern]]. Illegal use occurs if irritants have been placed on the same area of the horse's foot or leg.  The movement of a chain over a chemically traumatised area of the leg increases the painful response, resulting in the exaggerated gait.&lt;ref name="AVMA" /&gt; 
	
Soring is always illegal, but allowing use of chains varies depending on the show-sanctioning organization. The [[United States Equestrian Federation]] (USEF), the national governing body for equestrian sport in the U.S., disallows action devices in the show ring for all recognized national breed affiliates.&lt;ref name="AVMA2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.avma.org/KB/Policies/Pages/Use-of-Action-Devices-Performance-Packages-for-Tennessee-Walking-Horses.aspx|accessdate=March 31, 2016|title=Use of action devices and performance packages for Tennessee Walking Horses|author=AVMA|publisher=AVMA}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the [[Tennessee Walking Horse Breeders' and Exhibitors' Association]], which sanctions many shows, is not affiliated with the USEF and has different rules.

New legislation to update the HPA may lead to restrictions on these devices.

* '''Chains''': Bracelet-like chains are attached around the front pasterns of the horse, but to be legal, must weigh no more than {{convert|6|oz}}.&lt;ref name="AVMA" /&gt; They are intended to be used with a lubricant to allow them to slide easily along the pastern.  Users of chains do not believe they cause the horse pain, stating that it creates a similar feeling as a loose bracelet would around the wrist of a person. However, studies indicate they may be harmful above a certain weight. In 1982, a study at [[Auburn University]] examined the health effects of action devices on gaited horses through the use of thermography. The researchers conclude that chains "altered thermal patterns as early as day 2 of exercise with chains. These altered thermal patterns persisted as long as chains were used," with normal thermal patterns not seen until after 20 days of recovery. A stallion in the study developed lesions from {{convert|8|oz|adj=on}} chains, after wearing them in nine 15-minute exercise periods over 11 days. The Auburn study showed that 2-, 4-, and 6-ounce chains (55, 115, and 170&amp;nbsp;g) produced no adverse effects in the horses being studied.&lt;ref name="AVMA"&gt;{{cite web|title=Horse Soring and The Past Act, S. 1121 and H.R. 3268 |author=AVMA|publisher=American Veterinary Medical Association |url=https://www.avma.org/KB/Resources/Reference/AnimalWelfare/Documents/2015%20Soring%20Booklet%20Final_Logo.pdf|accessdate=March 31, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A {{convert|6|oz|adj=on}} chain is the legal weight of chain allowed in NHSC horse shows.

* '''Stacks''' are composed of multiple hoof-shaped pads, (wafer-like hoof-shaped objects) usually made of plastic, although they can also be made of leather, rubber or [[polyurethane]].  Ordinary pads are added under a horse's natural hoof, with a horseshoe at ground level.  While single, relatively thin pads, either flat or with a small wedge-shaped, are used with [[horseshoe]]s in many circumstances and can protect the sole of the hoof or make simple alterations to action.&lt;ref name="Smith"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Smith|first1=Bob|title=Hoof Pads 101|url=http://www.americanfarriers.com/articles/679-product-knowledge-hoof-pads-101|website=American Farrier's Journal|accessdate=March 31, 2016|date=April 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; But in this context, as an action device, stacks (also called  "performance packages") are built-up sets of multiple pads, sometimes of a combination of materials, and can even be made of wood.  They vary in height; they may be up to {{convert|4|in|cm}} thick in the heel and no more than {{convert|2|in|cm|0}} thick in the toe.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}  Pads that are built up on a horseshoe have a metal band that runs across the front of the hoof to help keep them on the horse's foot. This design is an extension of a base shoe, and can be taken off or changed without having to completely re-shoe the horse.  While the design is intended to exaggerate the horse's action, the shape of the stacks and added weight to the horse's foot cause the foot to strike with more force and at an abnormal angle.&lt;ref name="AVMA" /&gt;  Soring occurs when items are concealed between the pad and hoof such that painful pressure occurs to the sole of the hoof making the horse lift its feet faster and higher.&lt;ref name="AVMA" /&gt;  Permissible thickness` and weight vary between categories of competition.

The use of pads is controversial. Some criticize the band that holds the pad on, which they believe cuts into the hoof and may wear a slot into it. However, trainers commonly loosen the band when the horse is not being exercised, which may minimize the problem. Under normal conditions, if a pad is lost, it usually only affects the pad and not the base shoe, which remains intact.  Injuries are usually very limited from "throwing" a set of pads.  It is dangerous if a horse wearing pads pulls off a shoe, as not only will the pad come off, but the band may tear off part of the hoof wall. Horses wearing pads should not be turned out.

==Current status and legislation==

Soring has been prohibited at sales and shows for decades, but is still practiced.&lt;ref name="Equus"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://equisearch.com/horses_care/health/lameness/soring_030706/ |title=EQUUS Special Report: Why Soring Persists |publisher=Equisearch.com |date= |accessdate=2013-03-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140909111123/http://www.equisearch.com/article/soring_030706 |archivedate=2014-09-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It can be detected by observing the horse for [[Lameness (equine)|lameness]], assessing its stance, and palpating the lower legs. Some trainers can bypass inspectors by training horses not to react to the pain that palpation may cause, often by severely punishing the horse for flinching after the sored area is palpated. The practice is sometimes called "stewarding" in reference to the [[horse show steward]], who is often the first line of rule enforcement at any horse show. Trainers may also time the use of the agents so that chemicals will not be detected when the horse is examined, but will be in effect when the rider goes into the ring. Others use topical anesthetics, which are timed to wear off before the horse goes into the show ring.  Pressure shoeing is also used, eliminating use of chemicals altogether. Trainers who sore their horses leave the show grounds when they find that the more stringent federal inspectors are present.&lt;ref name="Equus"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wylie"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wylie|first1=Leslie|title=Right, Tradition or Obstinacy: A Look at 'Big Lick' By a Tennessean |url=http://www.horsenation.com/2015/09/22/right-tradition-or-obstinacy-a-look-at-big-lick-by-a-tennessean/|website=Horse Nation|accessdate=19 February 2017|date=September 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wylie"/&gt;

In 2006, due to new techniques in both soring and detection, the USDA began a larger crackdown on soring within the industry. A new device known as a "sniffer" (also used to detect the chemical presence of bombs in airport security) can now be employed, where swabbed samples are taken from the horse and then "sniffed".  At the 2006 Tennessee Walking Horse Celebration,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.twhnc.com/ |title=Tennessee Walking Horse National Celebration |publisher=Twhnc.com |date=2012-06-15 |accessdate=2013-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; the longstanding dispute between trainers and USDA inspectors came to a head.  The inspectors disqualified six of ten horses from showing on the night of Friday, August 25, 2006.  The trainers denied soring and challenged the monitoring methods.  The result was that a number of celebration championship classes were canceled, and considerable controversy over the situation still exists.  After a yearlong discussion between the industry and the USDA over the issues raised at the 2006 show, the 2007 championship went off without significant controversy.

{{anchor|ABC News}}An investigation by [[ABC News]] into the training methods of Tennessee Walking Horses revealed that many horses had been tortured and beaten to make them produce their signature high-stepping gait. In a video shot by the [[Humane Society of the United States]], high-profile trainer [[Jackie McConnell]] is seen beating horses, using electric cattle prods, and soring their hooves with caustic chemicals. Additionally, a random inspection by the Department of Agriculture at the 2011 annual championship found that all of the 52 horses inspected had a foreign substance applied to their front hooves, either to cause pain or hide it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Video Reveals Torture of Horses Trained to Win Championships|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Blotter/tennessee-walking-horses-abused/story?id=16360835|date=16 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2012, the American Association of Equine Practitioners and the [[American Veterinary Medical Association]] jointly issued a call to ban both action devices (chains, rollers, etc.) and "performance packages", e.g. stacks or pads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehorse.com/ViewArticle.aspx?ID=20171 |title=AVMA, AAEP Call for Ban on Action Devices for Tenn. Walkers |publisher=The Horse |date=2012-06-14 |accessdate=2013-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the 2013 Tennessee Walking Horse National Celebration, USDA testing showed that 67% of the horses tested positive for substances that could be used to hide soring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Barton|first1=Paul C.|title=Banned substances on horses undercut compliance claims|url=http://www.tennessean.com/story/news/politics/2014/08/17/banned-substances-horses-undercut-compliance-claims/14203755/|accessdate=22 August 2014|work=The Tennessean|date=17 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Once a prominent figure in the industry and hall of fame trainer, in 2012 McConnell pleaded guilty to 12 counts of animal cruelty and of violating the federal Horse Protection Act.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tennessean.com/article/20120524/NEWS03/305240046/Walking-Horse-board-slaps-trainer-Jackie-McConnell-lifetime-suspension&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.t-g.com/keywords/jackie_mcconnell&lt;/ref&gt; Formal sanctions were imposed on Jackie McConnell by the [[US Department of Agriculture]] pursuant to the Horse Protection Act numerous times between 1979 and 2012. According to Roy Exum of ''The Chattanoogan'', "McConnell has a known record that includes over 30 unbroken years of persistent violations of the federal Horse Protection Act, but because laws have been so lax, he has done little more than wink and continue on his way."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.humanesociety.org/assets/pdfs/horse/sherman_HPA_violations.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1986, McConnell was named Trainer of the Year by the Walking Horse Trainers Association.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.walkinghorsetrainers.com/national-champions/prior-champions/trainer-of-the-year.html “Trainers of the Year.”] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161026105218/http://walkinghorsetrainers.com/national-champions/prior-champions/trainer-of-the-year.html |date=2016-10-26 }} Walking Horse Trainers Association, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; However, he had a long history of violations:   In September 1998, McConnell entered a sored horse, Regal By Generator, in the 1998 Tennessee Walking Horse National Celebration and received a civil fine of $2,200 and a five-year disqualification from October 31, 2006, through October 30, 2011. In September 1989, McConnell was charged for exhibiting Executive Order (owned by Floyd Sherman) in the Tennessee Walking Horse National Celebration in [[Shelbyville, Tennessee|Shelbyville]] while sore. For that offense, he received a $2,000 civil fine and a two-year disqualification from March 19, 1995, through March 18, 1997. In May 1979, he entered the sored horse Threat's Black Power in the Ninth Annual Fun Show in Shelbyville, Tennessee. A USDA veterinarian classified this horse as the "sorest horse at the show," having an "exhausted, steaming, defeated appearance" and testified that the horse's front legs were covered with raised scars that when touched were found to be "very sore" causing "extreme pain." McConnell received a $750 civil penalty and a six-month disqualification from September 9, 1985, through March 8, 1986.&lt;ref&gt;In re Jackie McConnell, et al, 44 Agric.

McConnell was disqualified for a violation of the scar rule (September 6, 2005 to September 19, 2005). He was disqualified for a NHSC 5 Pt. Exam Score (August 8, 2004 to August 21, 2004). He was disqualified for a bilateral sore from August 31, 2003, to April 30, 2004. He was disqualified for a unilateral sore from October 6, 2002 to October 19, 2002.

In April and May 2011, an undercover investigator shot footage at McConnell's stable. The footage revealed two workers, Jeff Dockery and John Mays, applying caustic substances that cause soring to horses' legs and hooves and beating the animals with a wooden beam and an electric cattle prod to make them stand still during leg palpation.&lt;ref name="tennessean.com"&gt;http://www.tennessean.com/VideoNetwork/1644527149001/Humane-Society-releases-graphic-and-disturbing-video-of-soring-at-TN-Walking-Horse-barn&lt;/ref&gt;  Soon after the undercover footage was released, state authorities raided McConnell's barn.&lt;ref name="commercialappeal"&gt;{{cite web|last=Garlington |first=Lela |title=Collierville horse trainer gets house arrest, $25,000 fine |url=http://www.commercialappeal.com/news/2013/jul/09/collierville-horse-trainer-gets-house-arrest/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130711064338/http://www.commercialappeal.com/news/2013/jul/09/collierville-horse-trainer-gets-house-arrest/| archive-date=July 11, 2013 |website=Commercial Appeal| date= July 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; After ABC News aired the footage, McConnell was banned for life from the Tennessee Walking Horse organization's biggest event and stricken from its hall of fame.&lt;ref&gt;[http://usnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2012/09/19/13955200-horse-trainer-jackie-mcconnell-fined-for-caustic-chemical-cruelty?lite “Horse trainer Jackie McConnell fined for caustic chemical cruelty”] September 9, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

He pleaded guilty to a single charge of animal cruelty in an agreement with prosecutors. US District Judge [[Harry Sandlin Mattice Jr.]] accepted McConnell's plea. McConnell faced up to five years in prison if the agreement had not been accepted. He was required by the court to write a letter about the soring of horses, the pain it causes, the long-term effects, and its widespread use.&lt;ref name="tennessean.com"/&gt;

McConnell also pleaded guilty in state court to 12 of 22 counts of animal cruelty in 2012. He was sentenced to one year of house arrest and a $25,000 fine. The [[United States circuit court|Circuit]] Judge Weber McGraw sentenced Jackie McConnell and two co-defendants in July 2013. Jeff Dockery pleaded guilty to three counts of animal cruelty and John K. Mays to fourteen. Dockery was sentenced to three years of probation and Mays to four years of probation.&lt;ref name="commercialappeal" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.humanesociety.org/news/press_releases/2012/05/horse_soring_investigation_051712.html “Tennessee Walking Horse Trainer.”] Press Release from The HSUS.

The judge gave McConnell 120 days to sell his two remaining horses. According to ''[[The Commercial Appeal]]'', "This is the second time all three men have pleaded guilty rather than face trial."&lt;ref name="commercialappeal" /&gt;

The Tennessee Walking Horse Celebration, held each August in Shelbyville, Tennessee, banned McConnell from entering its grounds "for any and all events, regardless of the event's affiliation or ownership," according to a statement from the board. "This action is the strongest we can take and it clearly reflects our disgust with the actions of Mr. McConnell," said Doyle Meadows, CEO of Celebration.{{cn|date=September 2018}}

In 2013 Lee and Mike McGartland entered a horse named The Royal Dollar in the 74th annual Red Carpet Show of the South. The Royal Dollar placed third in its class, but during a post-show inspection, a veterinary officer of the U.S. Department of Agriculture determined that The Royal Dollar was sore.  From 2013 to 2016, the McGartlands received further official warnings and were identified as "violators" on the USDA web site. They sued the USDA, on the grounds that "the enforcement program denies due process to those accused of violations and breaks privacy laws by publishing personal information." {{As of|March 2017}} their case remains pending, but their lawsuit may be linked to the removal of records of animal welfare cases from the USDA's web site.&lt;ref name=washpost1&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/animalia/wp/2017/02/09/usda-animal-welfare-records-purge-may-have-been-triggered-by-horse-industry-lawsuit/?postshare=1711487353203645&amp;tid=ss_tw "USDA removed animal welfare reports from its site.

A '''substitution of attorney''' is a legal document that may be created during a [[lawsuit]] if a party wishes to replace its [[Lawyer|attorney]] with another one. Both attorneys must sign the document (which is otherwise [[void (law)|void]]).

A '''void marriage''' is a [[marriage]] which is [[Law|unlawful]] or invalid under the laws of the jurisdiction where it is entered.  A [[Void (law)|void]] marriage is "one that is void and invalid from its beginning.  It is as though the marriage never existed and it requires no formality to terminate."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lectlaw.com/def2/u040.htm|title=Legal Definition of Void Marriage|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A marriage, however, which can be canceled at the option of one of the parties is merely [[voidable marriage|voidable]], meaning it is subject to cancellation if contested in court. A marriage that is entered into in [[good faith]], but which is subsequently found to be void, may be recognized as a [[putative marriage]] and the spouses as putative spouses, with certain rights granted by statute or common law, notwithstanding that the marriage itself is void.

==History==
According to Paul J. Goda the distinction between void and voidable marriages arose in the context of a jurisdictional dispute between the civil and ecclesiastical courts. The civil courts held jurisdiction over property matters, while the church retained jurisdiction over the validity of marriages. There was an overlap in cases of inheritance where it was necessary to determine the legitimacy of putative heirs. With the Reformation the focus shifted from marriage as a religious matter to that of a civil contract. "Early American courts accepted the distinction between canonical
and civil disabilities as the rationale for void (civilly disabled) and voidable (canonically disabled) marriages."&lt;ref name=Goda&gt;[http://digitalcommons.law.scu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1491&amp;context=facpubs Goad, Paul J., "The Historical Evolution of the Concepts of Void and Voidable Marriages", 7 J. Fam. L. 297]&lt;/ref&gt; Colonial courts followed the Common Law view in looking to the capacity of the parties to enter into a legally binding contract. 

==Generally==
In general, a marriage is void (as opposed to voidable) if:

* The parties' degree of [[consanguinity]] is too close{{snd}}for example, a brother and sister or a parent and a child.  Different jurisdictions have different lists of prohibited [[incest|incestuous relationship]].
* A party to the marriage is forbidden to marry as a result of losing their civil rights, such as for conviction of a crime.
* The form of the marriage is forbidden by statute{{snd}}such as [[same-sex marriage]] (in some jurisdictions) or [[group marriage]]. Attempts to espouse a [[Ford Mustang|Ford motorcar]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://amarillo.com/stories/030699/usn_mancar.shtml "Man wants to marry his car, clerks say no", ''Amarillo Globe-News'', March 6, 1999]&lt;/ref&gt; or a "porn-filled [[Apple Macintosh|Apple computer]]"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailydot.com/lifestyle/florida-gay-marriage-troll/|title=This dude is actually trying to marry his porn-filled computer|work=The Daily Dot}}&lt;/ref&gt; have been dismissed as void.
* There is a pre-existing marriage by at least one of the parties, and the subsequent marriage may also constitute a crime of [[bigamy]].

Most jurisdictions recognise the validity of marriages performed in another jurisdiction. However, a jurisdiction where the parties to the marriage normally reside may not recognise a "foreign" marriage. Common reasons for a court to find a marriage void ''ab initio'' are that the marriage is incestuous, polygamous, a same-sex marriage,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/void_marriage "Void Marriage", ''Wex Legal Dictionary'']&lt;/ref&gt; or a [[group marriage]].

==New York law==
Under the Domestic Relations Law of [[New York (state)|New York]] State, all incestuous marriages are void, but this does '''not''' include cousin marriages ''of any degree'':

:§  5. Incestuous and void marriages. A marriage is incestuous and void whether the relatives are legitimate or illegitimate between either:
:1. An ancestor and a descendant;
:2. A brother and sister of either the whole or the half blood;
:3. An uncle and niece or an aunt and nephew.
:If a marriage prohibited by the foregoing provisions of this section be solemnized it shall be void...|N.Y. D.R.L., §5, found at.&lt;ref name="leginfo"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://public.leginfo.state.ny.us/menugetf.cgi?COMMONQUERY=LAWS|title=Legislative Information - LBDC|publisher=}}{{dead link|date=March 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

:§  6. Void marriages. A marriage is absolutely void if contracted by a person whose husband or wife by a former  marriage is living, unless either:
:1. Such former marriage has been annulled or has been dissolved for a cause other than the adultery of such person; provided, that if such former marriage has been dissolved for the cause of the adultery of such person,  he or she may marry again in the cases provided for in section eight of this chapter and such subsequent marriage shall be valid;
:3. Such former marriage has been dissolved pursuant to section seven-a of this chapter. (''This is regarding annulment of a [[voidable marriage]]''.)| N.Y. D.R.L., §6, found at.&lt;ref name="leginfo"/&gt;

==Law of England and Wales==

Under the law of [[England and Wales]], a void marriage is "one that is considered never to have taken place, whatever procedure may have been followed by the people concerned."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1973/18/part/I/crossheading/nullity Matrimonial Causes Act 1973]&lt;/ref&gt; The relevant legislation is sections 11 to 16 of the [[Matrimonial Causes Act 1973]]&lt;ref name=farrer&gt;[http://www.farrer.co.uk/Global/1/When_is_marriage_not_a_marriage.pdf Harrigin, Flora. "When is marriage not a marriage?", ''The Review'', issue 162, January/February 2013]&lt;/ref&gt; which has been amended by the [[Divorce (Religious Marriages) Act 2002]] and the [[Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Act 2013]] among others. 

Grounds for determining a marriage void as against public policy include consanguinity, one of the parties is under the age of sixteen, or that at the time of the marriage either party was already lawfully married. If a marriage was not legally valid, the law says that it never existed.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gov.uk/how-to-annul-marriage/when-you-can-annul-a-marriage "Void Marriages", Gov.UK]&lt;/ref&gt;
