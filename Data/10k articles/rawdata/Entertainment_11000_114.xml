'''Asian Aerospace''' ('''AA''') is an international [[trade fair]] for the [[aerospace]] business. Currently based in [[Hong Kong]], it was held in [[Singapore]] since 1981 until disagreements between co-organisers [[Reed Exhibitions]] and [[ST Engineering|Singapore Technologies]] in 2006 forced its relocation from 2007.

==History==
Asian Aerospace was held at the old Paya Lebar Airport in Singapore when it was first hosted in 1981. Organised by ITF, a British organiser, it grew to become the third largest [[airshow]] in the world, and was touted by its organisers as the "world’s second most influential airshow" [http://www.asianaerospace.com/pr_latest.asp?latest_pr_id=39]. ITF was subsequently acquired by Reed Exhibitions in 1982. Held once every two years, it boasted 759 exhibiting companies from 37 countries, a total of 26,814 trade visitors from 81 countries recorded, and trade deals amounting to USD3.52 billion were concluded in the 2004 event.

The largest edition of the show was held from 21 February to 24 February 2006, the 13th and final show in Singapore. Held jointly with several conferences including the Asia Pacific Security Conference (APSEC), the C4I Asia Conference (C4i Asia), the [[CAT (magazine)#Events|Asia Pacific Airline Training Symposium (APATS)]], the Asian Aerospace UAV Asia-Pacific Conference and the IATA/Asian Aerospace Aviation Summit, it featured a rebranded Asian Defense Technology military component. At show's end, it drew 940 exhibitors from 43 countries, 34,300 trade participants from 89 countries&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atwonline.com/magazine/article.html?articleID=1587 Asian Aerospace 2006- A Quiet Departure&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080219062626/http://www.atwonline.com/magazine/article.html?articleID=1587 |date=February 19, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and concluded a record US15.2 billion in sales.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.forbes.com/home/feeds/afx/2006/02/26/afx2553812.html Asian Aerospace clinches record 15 bln usd in deals - Forbes.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relocation===
From 2008, the show moved from [[Singapore]] as Reed Exhibitions could not agree with the [[Government of Singapore]] over development plans for a new 24-hectare permanent exhibition site in [[Changi]]. While Reeds was still in negotiations to source for a new location, the Singapore government announced its intentions to organise the [[Singapore Airshow]] from 2008 in the absence of Asian Aerospace. It was revealed on February 13, 2006 [http://www.rthk.org.hk/rthk/news/englishnews/newsframe.htm?20060214&amp;56&amp;287880] that Reed has chosen [[AsiaWorld-Expo]] at [[Hong Kong International Airport]] [[Chek Lap Kok|island]], [[Lantau Island]], [[Hong Kong]] as the new site, with the first relocated show to be held in 2007 to avoid clashing with the [[Singapore Airshow]] the following year.

On September 3, 2007 the 4-day Asian Aerospace International [[Trade fair|Expo]] and Congress kicked off in [[Hong Kong]] with 500 companies from 20 countries participating. The [[Airbus A380]] was allowed to do a special [[flypast]] twice over the [[Victoria Harbour]] as part of the show.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/eastasia/view/297707/1/.html [[Channel NewAsia]], Asia's largest air show kicks off in Hong Kong]&lt;/ref&gt; The Aircraft Interiors EXPO ASIA was held concurrently with the airshow, but the scaled-down show was without its military-related businesses due to political sensitivities in relation to [[China]]. Immediately prior to the event's commencement, Reeds announced over 500 [[exhibitor]]s from over 20 countries and around 10,000 pre-registered trade visitors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hongkongairport.com/eng/pr/pr_901.html Hong Kong International Airport - Media Centre - Press Release - The World's Leading Civil Aerospace Exhibition Debuts in Hong Kong]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Plot ==
Emelie is greatly annoyed by her significant other Jack. After she leaves to ride her bicycle along a trail, Jack gets into his car with a box and drives to the trail. As Emelie is riding her bike, she is startled by a bear, and accidentally falls off a cliff. Behind the bear, there are colourful birthday decorations. The bear, revealed to be Jack in a bear costume, rushes down the cliff to Emelie's side. After reconciling with the injured Emelie, he jokingly puts the bear mask back on, and is shot by a [[Bear hunting|bear hunter]].

==Cast==
*[[Nash Edgerton]] as Jack
*[[Teresa Palmer]] as Emelie
*[[Warwick Thornton]] as Ranger

==Reception==

===Critical response===
The film earned mainly positive reviews from critics. Ivan Kander of ''short of the week'' gave film the positive review said "Edgerton isn’t trying to surprise you—he already pulled off that magic trick once with Spider. Instead, he’s reveling a bit in a sort of misanthropic playground. Our protagonist is a cartoon character of sorts—the Wile E. Coyote of cinematic schadenfreude. He’s always getting himself, and his loved ones, into the darndest, deadliest situations. And, all the while, we can’t help but laugh at his misfortune."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bear:JACK HAS THE PERFECT BIRTHDAY SURPRISE PLANNED FOR EMELIE. SOMETIMES, THOUGH, PLANS GO HORRIFICALLY WRONG.

Predictable of course for this reason, but still funny and well produced."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CELLULOID SCREAMS SHORTS 2011|url=http://blueprintreview.co.uk/2011/11/celluloid-screams-shorts-2011/|accessdate=18 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another critic in his review said that "Reviewing a film this short is going to be fairly similar to reviewing an advert, because and with so little time to build character or a world, it essentially comes down to did you did or did you didn’t like the punch. In this case, I did, it gave me a legitimate ‘ I didn’t see that coming’ moment, upon the fact that it was coolly put together and even pulls of a very impressive stunt. Not one I’ll remember for the rest of my days for sure, but an amusing distraction, which is exactly what I think it was designed to be."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bear Review|url=http://battleroyalewithcheese.com/2013/02/bear-review/|accessdate=18 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bikutsi''' is a [[musical genre]] from [[Cameroon]]. It developed from the traditional styles of the [[Beti-Pahuin|Beti]],&lt;ref name="bible"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Drummer's Bible: How to Play Every Drum Style from Afro-Cuban to Zydeco |author1=Mick Berry |author2=Jason Gianni |year=2003 |publisher=See Sharp Press |location= |isbn=978-1-884365-32-4 |page=74 |url=https://books.google.com/books?accessdate=2010-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; or Ewondo, people, who live around the city of [[Yaoundé]]. It was popular in the middle of the 20th century in West Africa.&lt;ref name="bible"/&gt; It is primarily [[dance music]].&lt;ref name="bible"/&gt;

==Etymology==
The word 'bikutsi' literally means 'beat the earth' or 'let's beat the earth' (''bi''- indicates a plural, -''kut''- means 'to beat' and -''chi'' means 'earth'.) The name indicates a dance that is accompanied by stomping the feet on the ground.

==Description==
Bikutsi is characterised by an intense {{music|time|6|8}} rhythm (3+3, with a strong "two" feel), though it is occasionally [[9/8|{{music|time|9|8}}]]&lt;ref name="bible"/&gt; and its tempo is usually [[quarternote]].&lt;ref name="bible"/&gt; it is played at all sorts of Beti gatherings, including parties, funerals and weddings.

Beti gatherings fall into two major categories:

* Ekang phase: the time when imaginary, mythological and spiritual issues are discussed
* Bikutsi phase: when real-life issues are discussed

A double sided harp with [[calabash]] amplification called the ''mvet'' is used during these ceremonies, by Beti storytellers, who are viewed as using the ''mvet'' as an instrument of God to educate the people. The Ekang phase is intensely musical, and usually lasts all night. There are poetic recitations accompanied by clapping and dancing, with interludes for improvised and sometimes obscene performances on the [[balafon]] (a type of xylophone). These interludes signal the shift to the bikutsi phase, which is much less strictly structured than Ekang. During bikutsi, women dance and sing along with the balafon, and lyrics focus on relationships, sexuality and the lives of famous people.&lt;ref name="entertaining"/&gt; These female choruses are an integral part of bikutsi, and their intense dancing and screams are characteristic of the genre. Traditional bikutsi was often ironic in its content, as many modern bikutsi songs still are.

In its modern form, bikutsi is very popular, and rivals [[makossa]] as the country's most renowned style.

==History==
Popular bikutsi first appeared in the 1940s with the recording of [[Anne-Marie Nzie]]. Some twenty years later, the style was electrified with the addition of [[Keyboard instrument|keyboards]] and [[guitar]]s. The most popular performer of this period was [[Messi Me Nkonda Martin]], frontman for [[Los Camaroes]] and known as "the father of modern bikutsi music".&lt;ref name="entertaining"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=NYAMNJOH |first1=FRANCIS B. |last2=FOKWANG |first2=JUDE |year=2005 |title=ENTERTAINING REPRESSION:MUSIC AND POLITICS IN POSTCOLONIAL CAMEROON |journal=African Affairs |publisher=Oxford University Press on behalf of Royal African Society |volume= 104|issue= 415|pages=251–274 |url=http://afraf.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/reprint/104/415/251 |doi=10.1093/afraf/adi007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In an effort to translate the sound and spirit of traditional bikutsi music to more modern terms, Messi incorporated the sound of a balafon into the electric guitar by linking together the guitar strings with lengths of cotton cord. Played in this way, the electric guitar sounded similar to the balafon. The music itself, then, was only slightly altered, while the image and outside perception of bikutsi music was changed enormously. Other bands during this time, such as [[Les Vétérans]], were also popular.

International acclaim began in 1987 with the formation of [[Les Têtes Brûlées]] by [[Jean Marie Ahanda]]. The late guitarist of Les Têtes Brulées, [[Zanzibar (musician)|Zanzibar]], invented the trick of damping the strings of his guitar with a strip of foam rubber to produce the music's characteristic balafon-like thunk. (The [[balafon]] is a marimba-like instrument that is widely used in African folk music.) More modern performers include [[Jimmy Mvondo Mvelé]] and [[Mbarga Soukous]].

Present-day bikutsi as performed by artists like [[Lady Ponce]], [[K-Tino]], [[Racine Sagath]] and [[Natascha Bizo]] is sometimes regarded as controversial. It has been criticised for the perceived sexual content of its lyrics and dancing style. In this respect bikutsi resembles [[mapouka]] from [[Côte d'Ivoire]], which is also considered indecent by many Africans. The main difference is that present day bikutsi is still often performed by female artists who use it as a means of self-expression in a traditionally male-dominated society.

Thus a singer like K-Tino, self-styled ''femme du peuple'' (''woman of the people'') sees herself as having an important part to play in the emancipation and liberation of the women of Cameroon.

Among the current crop of artists are [[Patou Bass]] and [[Ovasho Bens]], the promoter of a dance and philosophy called "[[zig zag]]". His first album is composed not only of Cameroonian traditional rhythms but also West Indian [[zouk]] and Jamaican-style [[reggae]].

Bikutsi has influenced Western musicians such as [[Paul Simon]] on his 1990 album ''[[The Rhythm of the Saints]]''.&lt;ref name="bible"/&gt;

In 2004, he was honored by being inducted into the [[International Bluegrass Music Museum]]'s Hall of Fame.  He died on November 20, 1996 in Rocky Mount.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2535">The '''Canadian Comic Book Creator Awards Association''' was formed in 2004 as a means to honour [[Canadians|Canadian]] creators, publishers and retailers in the medium of [[comic books]].

With permission of the estate of [[Joe Shuster]], the Canadian-born co-creator of [[Superman]] the creator and publisher awards are named the [[Joe Shuster Awards]] for Canadian Comic Book Creators. The JSA's honour excellence in Canadian comic book writing, art, cartooning, publishing and more. There is also a Hall of Fame that honours veteran creators. An additional award, the Outstanding Canadian retailer award is named after [[Harry Kremer]] the late owner of [[Now &amp; Then Books]] in [[Kitchener, Ontario]].

==Overview==
The organization consists of an administrative (or executive) committee, a series of nominating committees and juries.

The only provision for active membership in any of the nominating committees or the administrative committee is that the member not be actively creating or publishing comic books, webcomics or graphic novels that could be eligible for consideration for any of the existing categories during the judging period. Eligible publishers and creators may participate in the special judging committee for the Harry Kremer comic book retailer award.

The Association is a not-for-profit organization. Funds for the [[Joe Shuster Awards]] are raised from donations, sponsorship and eBay auctions of prints and other specialty items.

In late 2007, the CCBCAA membership ratified an organizational charter, the position of Executive Director and Associate Director were created (supplanting Chairperson and Assistant). Directors of the CCBCAA are voted into their positions for two award seasons, unless they vacate the position prior to the end of term.

In 2008 a new fundraising initiative was launched entitled "Visions of an Icon". The Visions project involves the donation of original art interpretations of a single comic book character by Canadian artists and cartoonists. The pieces are displayed on a few occasions and then auctioned off on eBay to raise funds for the next year's awards. In 2008 the subject was [[Superman]] and in 2009 the subject was [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]]. The Visions program was suspended in 2010.

[[File:Dr. Seuss WikiWorld.png|thumb|300px|Example of a modern cartoon. The text was excerpted by cartoonist Greg Williams from the Wikipedia article on [[Dr. Seuss]]|alt=A cartoon shows a bearded man with a red bow tie holding numerous items. He holds the hat from Dr. Seuss's "The Cat in the Hat" and balances a fishbowl on his left index finger.]]
A '''cartoon''' is a type of [[illustration]], possibly animated, typically in a non-[[realism (arts)|realistic]] or semi-realistic style. The specific meaning has evolved over time, but the modern usage usually refers to either: an image or series of images intended for [[satire]], [[caricature]], or [[humor]]; or a motion picture that relies on a sequence of illustrations for its animation. Someone who creates cartoons in the first sense is called a ''[[cartoonist]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[[Webster's Dictionary|Merriam-Webster's Dictionary]].&lt;/ref&gt; and in the second sense they are usually called an ''[[animator]]''.

The concept originated in the [[Middle Ages]], and first described a preparatory drawing for a piece of art, such as a painting, [[fresco]], [[tapestry]], or [[stained glass]] window. In the 19th century, beginning in ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'' magazine in 1843, cartoon came to refer – ironically at first – to humorous illustrations in magazines and newspapers. In the early 20th century, it began to refer to [[Animated cartoon|animated]] films which resembled print cartoons.&lt;ref name=Becker&gt;{{harvnb|Becker|1959}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fine art==
{{Main article|Modello}}
A cartoon (from {{Lang-it|cartone}} and {{Lang-nl|karton}}—words describing strong, heavy paper or pasteboard) is a full-size drawing made on sturdy [[paper]] as a study or ''[[modello]]'' for a [[painting]], [[stained glass]], or [[tapestry]]. Cartoons were typically used in the production of [[fresco]]es, to accurately link the component parts of the composition when painted on damp [[plaster]] over a series of days (''giornate'').{{sfn|Constable|1954|page=115}}

Such cartoons often have pinpricks along the outlines of the design so that a bag of soot patted or "pounced" over a cartoon, held against the wall, would leave black dots on the plaster ("pouncing"). Cartoons by [[Painting|painter]]s, such as the [[Raphael Cartoons]] in London, and examples by [[Leonardo da Vinci]], are highly prized in their own right. Tapestry cartoons, usually colored, were followed with the eye by the [[weaving|weavers]] on the [[loom]].&lt;ref name=Becker/&gt;{{sfn|Adelson|1994|page=330}}

==Print media==
&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Stoke-on-Trent]] --&gt;
[[File:SubstanceandShadow.jpg|left|250px|thumb|[[John Leech (caricaturist)|John Leech]], ''Cartoon no.1: Substance and Shadow'', 1843, satirized preparatory cartoons for frescoes in the Palace of Westminster, creating the modern meaning of "cartoon"|alt=A detailed black-and-white illustration is vignetted in the center showing people of various sizes looking at pictures framed on the left and back walls.]]

In print media, a cartoon is an illustration or series of illustrations, usually humorous in intent. This usage dates from 1843, when ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'' magazine applied the term to satirical drawings in its pages,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Punch.co.uk|title=History of the Cartoon|url=http://punch.co.uk/cartoonhistory02.html|access-date=2007-11-01|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071111013522/http://www.punch.co.uk/cartoonhistory02.html|archive-date=2007-11-11|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; particularly sketches by [[John Leech (caricaturist)|John Leech]].{{sfn|Adler|Hill|2008|p=30}} The first of these parodied the preparatory cartoons for grand historical frescoes in the then-new [[Palace of Westminster]]. The original title for these drawings was ''Mr Punch's face is the letter Q'' and the new title "cartoon" was intended to be ironic, a reference to the self-aggrandizing posturing of Westminster politicians.

Cartoons can be divided into gag cartoons, which include editorial cartoons, and comic strips.

Modern single-panel [[gag cartoon|''gag cartoons'']], found in magazines, generally consist of a single drawing with a typeset caption positioned beneath, or—less often—a [[speech balloon]].{{sfn|Bishop|2009|p=92}} Newspaper syndicates have also distributed single-panel gag cartoons by [[Mel Calman]], [[Bill Holman (cartoonist)|Bill Holman]], [[Gary Larson]], [[George Lichty]], [[Fred Neher]] and others. Many consider ''[[The New Yorker|New Yorker]]'' cartoonist [[Peter Arno]] the father of the modern gag cartoon (as did Arno himself).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Maslin |first1=Michael |title=The Peter Arno Cartoons That Help Rescue The New Yorker |url=https://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/the-peter-arno-cartoons-that-helped-rescue-the-new-yorker |publisher=The New Yorker |accessdate=2018-09-16 |date=May 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The roster of magazine gag cartoonists includes [[Charles Addams]], [[Charles Barsotti]], and [[Chon Day]].

[[Bill Hoest]], [[Jerry Marcus]], and [[Virgil Partch]] began as magazine gag cartoonists and moved to syndicated [[comic strips]]. [[Richard Thompson (cartoonist)|Richard Thompson]] is noteworthy in the area of newspaper cartoon illustration; he illustrated numerous feature articles in ''[[The Washington Post]]'' before creating his ''[[Cul de Sac (comic strip)|Cul de Sac]]'' comic strip. The sports section of newspapers usually featured cartoons, sometimes including syndicated features such as Chester "Chet" Brown's ''[[All in Sport]]''.

''[[Editorial cartoons]]'' are found almost exclusively in news publications and news websites. Although they also employ humor, they are more serious in tone, commonly using [[irony]] or [[satire]]. The art usually acts as a visual metaphor to illustrate a point of view on current social or political topics. Editorial cartoons often include speech balloons and sometimes use multiple panels. [[Editorial cartoonist]]s of note include [[Herblock]], [[David Low (cartoonist)|David Low]], [[Jeff MacNelly]], [[Mike Peters (cartoonist)|Mike Peters]], and [[Gerald Scarfe]].&lt;ref name=Becker/&gt;

''Comic strips'', also known as ''cartoon strips'' in the United Kingdom, are found daily in newspapers worldwide, and are usually a short series of cartoon illustrations in sequence. In the United States, they are not commonly called "cartoons" themselves, but rather "comics" or "[[Sunday comics|funnies]]". Nonetheless, the creators of comic strips—as well as [[comic book]]s and [[graphic novel]]s—are usually referred to as "[[cartoonist]]s". Although humor is the most prevalent subject matter, adventure and drama are also represented in this medium. Some noteworthy cartoonists of humorous comic strips are [[Scott Adams]], [[Steve Bell (cartoonist)|Steve Bell]], [[Charles Schulz]], [[E. C. Segar]], [[Mort Walker]] and [[Bill Watterson]].&lt;ref name=Becker/&gt;

===Political cartoons===
{{main article|Editorial cartoon}}

Political cartoons are like illustrated editorial that serve visual commentaries on political events. They offer subtle criticism which are cleverly quoted with humour and satire to the extent that the criticized does not get embitered.

The pictorial satire of [[William Hogarth]] is regarded as a precursor to the development of political cartoons in 18th century England.{{sfn|Press|1981|page=34}} [[George Townshend, 1st Marquess Townshend|George Townshend]] produced some of the first overtly political cartoons and caricatures in the 1750s.{{sfn|Press|1981|page=34}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Birth+of+England%27s+pocket+cartoon%3B+LOCAL+HISTORY+Smile+awhile+through...-a0153110971| title=Birth of England's pocket cartoon|author=Chris Upton|publisher=The Free Library}}&lt;/ref&gt; The medium began to develop in the latter part of the 18th century under the direction of its great exponents, [[James Gillray]] and [[Thomas Rowlandson]], both from London. Gillray explored the use of the medium for lampooning and [[caricature]], and has been referred to as the father of the political cartoon.{{sfn|Rowson|2015}} By calling the king, prime ministers and generals to account for their behaviour, many of Gillray's satires were directed against [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]], depicting him as a pretentious buffoon, while the bulk of his work was dedicated to ridiculing the ambitions of [[revolutionary France]] and [[Napoleon]].{{sfn|Rowson|2015}} [[George Cruikshank]] became the leading cartoonist in the period following Gillray, from 1815 until the 1840s. His career was renowned for his social caricatures of English life for popular publications.

[[File:Tammany Ring, Nast crop.jpg|thumb|250px|Nast depicts the [[Tweed Ring]]: "Who stole the people's money?" / "'Twas him."|alt=A cartoon showing a circle of men pointing their fingers at the man to their right with grimaces on their faces.]]

By the mid 19th century, major political newspapers in many other countries featured cartoons commenting on the politics of the day. [[Thomas Nast]], in New York City, showed how realistic German drawing techniques could redefine American cartooning.{{sfn|Adler|Hill|2008|p=24}} His 160 cartoons relentlessly pursued the criminal characteristic of the [[William M. Tweed|Tweed machine]] in New York City, and helped bring it down. Indeed, Tweed was arrested in Spain when police identified him from Nast's cartoons.{{sfn|Adler|Hill|2008|pp=49–50}} Sir [[John Tenniel]] was the toast of London.{{sfn|Morris|Tenniel|2005|p=344}}

Political cartoons can be humorous or satirical, sometimes with piercing effect. The target of the humor may complain, but they can seldom fight back. Lawsuits have been very rare; the first successful lawsuit against a cartoonist in over a century in Britain came in 1921, when [[J. H. Thomas]], the leader of the [[National Union of Railwaymen]] (NUR), initiated libel proceedings against the magazine of the [[British Communist Party]]. Thomas claimed defamation in the form of cartoons and words depicting the events of "Black Friday", when he allegedly betrayed the locked-out [[Miners' Federation of Great Britain|Miners' Federation]]. To Thomas, the framing of his image by the far left threatened to grievously degrade his character in the popular imagination. Soviet-inspired communism was a new element in European politics, and cartoonists unrestrained by tradition tested the boundaries of libel law. Thomas won the lawsuit and restored his reputation.&lt;ref&gt;Samuel S.  Hyde, "'Please, Sir, he called me “Jimmy!' Political Cartooning before the Law: 'Black Friday,' J.H. Thomas, and the Communist Libel Trial of 1921," ''Contemporary British History'' (2011) 25#4 pp 521-550&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scientific cartoons===
Cartoons such as ''[[xkcd]]'' have also found their place in the world of [[science]], [[mathematics]], and [[technology]]. Cartoons related to [[chemistry]] are, for example, the ''Wonderlab'', which looked at daily life in the lab.  In the U.S., one well-known cartoonist for these fields is [[Sidney Harris (cartoonist)|Sidney Harris]]. Not all, but many of [[Gary Larson]]'s cartoons have a scientific flavor.

===Comic books&lt;!--'Humor comics' and 'Humour comics' redirect here--&gt;===
{{Main|Comic book}}
 
Books with cartoons are usually magazine-format "comic books," or occasionally [[Comics collection|reprints of newspaper cartoons]].

In Britain in the 1930s adventure magazines became quite popular, especially those published by [[DC Thomson]]; the publisher sent observers around the country to talk to boys and learn what they wanted to read about. The story line in magazines, comic books and cinema that most appealed to boys was the glamorous heroism of British soldiers fighting wars that were exciting and just.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ernest Sackville Turner]], ''Boys Will Be Boys: The Story of Sweeney Todd, Deadwood Dick, Sexton Blake, Billy Bunter, Dick Barton et al.'' (3rd ed. 1975).&lt;/ref&gt;  D.C. Thomson issued the first [[The Dandy|''The Dandy Comic'']] in December 1937. It had a revolutionary design that broke away from the usual children's comics that were published broadsheet in size and not very colourful.  Thomson capitalized on its success with a similar product ''[[The Beano]]''  in 1938.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=M. Keith Booker|title=Comics through Time: A History of Icons, Idols, and Ideas &amp;#91;4 volumes&amp;#93;: A History of Icons, Idols, and Ideas|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hnuQBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA74|year=2014|page=74}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On some occasions, new gag cartoons have been created for book publication, as was the case with ''[[Think Small]]'', a 1967 promotional book distributed as a giveaway by [[Volkswagen]] dealers. [[Bill Hoest]] and other cartoonists of that decade drew cartoons showing Volkswagens, and these were published along with humorous automotive essays by such humorists as [[H. Allen Smith]], [[Roger Price (comedy)|Roger Price]] and [[Jean Shepherd]]. The book's design juxtaposed each cartoon alongside a photograph of the cartoon's creator.

==Animation==
[[File:Animhorse.gif|thumb|200px|An [[animated cartoon]] horse, drawn by [[rotoscoping]] from [[Eadweard Muybridge]]'s 19th-century photos|alt=a running horse (animated)]]
{{Main article|Animated cartoon}}
Because of the stylistic similarities between comic strips and early animated movies, ''cartoon'' came to refer to [[animation]], and the word ''cartoon'' is currently used in reference to both animated cartoons and gag cartoons.{{sfn|Walasek|2009|p=116}}  While ''animation'' designates any style of illustrated images seen in rapid succession to give the impression of movement, the word "cartoon" is most often used as a descriptor for television programs and short films aimed at children, possibly featuring [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphized]] animals,{{sfn|Wells|2008|p=41}} [[superhero]]es, the adventures of child protagonists or related themes.

In the 1980s, ''cartoon'' was shortened to ''toon'', referring to characters in animated productions. This term was popularized in 1988 by the combined live-action/animated film ''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]'', followed in 1990 by the animated TV series ''[[Tiny Toon Adventures]]''.

Cliffjumper's bio indicates that he compensates for his small size by being the first to rush into any dangerous situation, desiring only to beat up "Decepti-creeps." Although this trait has his fellow Autobots' respect, occasionally it ensnares him into situations he cannot handle. His motto is "Let me at 'em!" &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seibertron.com/database/character.php?view=&amp;char_id=18 Cliffjumper (Autobot Mini-Bots, Transformers G1)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Cliffjumper's weapon is his glass gas gun, which fires a gas that turns metal as brittle as glass for a short time. In the episode "Fire In the Sky," he mentions his gun has a "defrost cycle" to melt ice.

According to original tech spec notes written by [[Bob Budiansky]] found at [[Iacon One]] in 2006 the original name for Cliffjumper was [[Blow-Out]], a name later used for a ''Generation 2'' Autobot.

Hasbro registered the name Cliffjumper for U.S. [[Trademark]] in October 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.seibertron.com/transformers/news/hasbro-registers-names/1668/ |title=Hasbro Registers Names |publisher=Seibertron.com |date=2012-10-29 |accessdate=2012-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Animated series ===
In ''[[The Transformers (TV series)|The Transformers]]'' animated series, Cliffjumper was part of the original Autobot crew of the [[Ark (Transformers)|Ark]]. When the Autobots and Decepticons were reawakened, Cliffjumper was given the alternate mode of an Earth car. He and [[Hound (Transformers)|Hound]] were sent to scout out the location of the Decepticons. Although ordered not to engage the Decepticons, Cliffjumper took the opportunity to try to shoot [[Megatron (Transformers)|Megatron]], revealing their existence to the Decepticons. Because of this, Hound was blown off the road by [[Laserbeak]] – something that made Cliffjumper regret his impulsiveness. Hound, however, did not blame him, quipping that he was only sorry he missed.

Cliffjumper's bravery was often a boon to the Autobots – as well as a problem. In the episode "Changing [[Gears (Transformers)|Gears]]", Cliffjumper's rash actions helped the Autobots get past a Decepticon force field and stop their Solar Needle device from destroying the sun. However, Cliffjumper survived the blast but he ended up having a temporary concussion which he was able to recover quickly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/230787/The-Transformers-Changing-Gears/overview | work=The New York Times | title=Error - - New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cliffjumper's most prominent appearance came in the season 2 episode "Traitor", where he developed the belief that [[Mirage (Transformers)|Mirage]] had sold them out to the Decepticons after missing a Decepticon power plant while on patrol. Mirage then devised a scheme to prove he was not a traitor, setting the Decepticons and [[Insecticons]], who were in a feud, against each other. However, Cliffjumper had followed him, and misinterpreted his actions. Reporting back to base, Cliffjumper told [[Optimus Prime]] what he saw and then believed he must be stopped. But Prime decided to go back to the power plant to stop the Decepticons and then find Mirage so they can hear his side of the story with [[Ratchet (Transformers)|Ratchet]] accompanying them. Once they got to the power plant they saw no one there until Mirage shows up, who led them into an ambush by the Decepticons and Insecticons. The reason for the setup soon became apparent, as Mirage had been implanted by one of [[Bombshell (Transformers)|Bombshell]]'s cerebro shells which Ratchet removed, after Cliffjumper knocked him out. Cliffjumper did realize that Mirage didn't betray the Autobots, along with realizing that Mirage was telling him the truth of not seeing them while he was on patrol, when he heard both Prime and Ratchet sum up as to why Mirage set them up. After the Decepticon plant's destruction, Cliffjumper apologized to Mirage for not believing him.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.anime.com/Transformers/ Transformers Season Two Box Set, Part 1 by Brian Cirulnick, February 2003] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101119132401/http://www.anime.com/Transformers/ |date=November 19, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In "Starscream's Brigade", Cliffjumper and [[Jazz (Transformers)|Jazz]] were invited as guest of honor for an unveiling of a statue for their leader Prime but were under attack when [[Starscream (Transformers)|Starscream]] showed up, after he broke off from [[Megatron (Transformers)|Megatron]], along with his newly created [[Combaticons]]. During the scuffle Cliffjumper suggested to Jazz into calling headquarters for help but were captured before they can make the call, as Starscream wanted their Energy absorber for the Combaticons. Cliffjumper with Jazz were chained up at a water and power plant but they did get rescued by the other Autobots when they found their location.

During ''[[The Transformers: The Movie]]'', Cliffjumper, with Jazz again is stationed on Moonbase 1, from which try unsuccessfully to escape when attacked by [[Unicron]]. After their apparent consumption by the planet-eater, they are ultimately saved by [[Witwicky family#Daniel Witwicky|Daniel Witwicky]].

By season 3, Cliffjumper was reduced to a background character, a result of voice actor [[Casey Kasem]]'s objection to the portrayal of Arab characters as stereotypical villains&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ameu.org/page.asp?iid=108&amp;aid=152&amp;pg=6 ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041106013245/http://www.ameu.org/page.asp?iid=108&amp;aid=152&amp;pg=6 |date=November 6, 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and eventual departure from the show.

His last appearance in the original U.S. cartoon was in "Five Faces of Darkness, Part 1", the first episode of the third season.

===Comics===

==== Devil's Due Publishing ====
Cliffjumper reappeared in the third G.I. Joe vs. the Transformers crossover series from [[Devil's Due Publishing]] as part of the combined Autobot/G.I. Joe force trying to rescue Optimus Prime.

==== Dreamwave Productions ====
When civil war broke out on the planet Cybertron between the Autobots and Decepticons, Cliffjumper joined the Autobot cause.
When Decepticon Military Operations Commander [[Shockwave (Transformers)|Shockwave]] led a force of Decepticons against the Autobot capitol of Iacon, Cliffjumper was among the Autobots who defended the capitol (Transformers: War Within #3).

When Decepticon leader Megatron and Autobot leader Optimus Prime disappeared in an accident with a space bridge, the Autobot and Decepticon forces splintered into smaller factions. Cliffjumper stayed with the Autobots under the leadership of [[Prowl (Transformers)|Prowl]]. Learning that the Decepticons were testing a new mobile command base at the Praetorus Wharf, Prowl led Cliffjumper, [[Gears (Transformers)|Gears]], Jazz, [[Skids (Transformers)|Skids]] and [[Sideswipe (Transformers)|Sideswipe]] to investigate. What they discovered was [[Trypticon]]. The giant Decepticon easily routed them, and Prowl's team were only saved by Shockwave's calling him away to battle against the [[Fallen (Transformers)|Fallen]] and [[Chaos Trinity]]. (Transformers: The War Within - The Dark Ages #3).

Six million years ago, [[Ultra Magnus]] united the Autobot factions and lead them to victory over Decepticons and [[Ultracons]]. Megatron returned to Cybertron in command of the clone forces of the Aerospace Extermination Squadron and took over Cybertron. Cliffjumper was among the Autobots enslaved and forced to labor tunneling into Cybertron's core (Transformers: War Within - The Age of Wrath #2). Eventually Optimus Prime returned to Cybertron and helped free the enslaved Autobots.

Cliffjumper was among the Autobots who followed Optimus Prime on his mission on board the Ark and crash landed on Earth.
In 1984, when the Ark's computer re-activated, it reformatted Cliffjumper as in the form of an Earth car. Eventually the combined forces of the Autobots on Earth, and their human allies were able to capture the Decepticons. A ship called the Ark II was built to take the Cybertronians back to Cybertron, along with some human companions, but the ship exploded shortly after takeoff. The human allies were killed, but the Cybertronians were lost in the ocean, again in stasis lock.

Cliffjumper traveled to Cybertron along with Optimus Prime and a number of Autobots when arrested by Ultra Magnus.

[[Bumblebee (Transformers)|Bumblebee]] was placed in command of the Autobot supply shuttle Orion, with [[Powerglide (Transformers)|Powerglide]], [[Warpath (Transformers)|Warpath]], [[Seaspray (Transformers)|Seaspray]], [[Cosmos (Transformers)|Cosmos]], Cliffjumper, Bumper and the [[Powerdashers]] assigned to him. Their mission was to aid the Autobots on Earth. Upon arriving in the Earth system from transwarp space, they witnessed the arrival of [[Sunstorm (Transformers)|Sunstorm]] (Transformers: Generation One III #1). After [[Omega Supreme]] was damaged in the fight with Sunstorm, Cliffjumper was reluctantly assigned the duty of protecting him until he recovered. Dreamwave would go out of business at this point, preventing any further tales of Cliffjumper from being told.

==== Fun Publications ====
The ''Classics'' storyline by [[Fun Publications]] is set in a sequel to the Marvel Comics story, ignoring the events of the U.K. and ''Generation 2'' comics. It is revealed that Cliffjumper had been in stasis since the attack by the Underbase powered Starscream in the Marvel Comics story, and was only recently revitalized on Cybertron. [[Optimus Prime]] then returns to Earth commanding a small groups of Autobots including Cliffjumper when they learn Megatron has returned.

In ''[[Crossing Over (Transformers)|Crossing Over]]'' the mysterious [[Skyfall (Transformers)|Skyfall]] allies himself with the Autobots as they investigate a strange energy reading in South America. Cliffjumper is assigned to watch over Skyfall by Optimus Prime. Skyfall, Cliffjumper and the Decepticon Landquake arrive in an underground energon pool together and meet the Autobot [[Breakaway (Transformers)|Breakaway]], who is guarding the pool, but has little memory of why. Together Breakaway, Landquake and Skyfall feel they are somehow connected. Cliffjumper refuses to leave Skyfall as they are sent through a dimensional portal by Breakaway's Caretaker computer to find their "fourth".

In the ''Transformers: Timelines'' story "[[Shattered Glass (Transformers)|Shattered Glass]]" Cliffjumper is separated in dimensional transit and ends up by himself on a mirror universe Cybertron where the tyrant Optimus Prime and his evil Autobots are opposed by Megatron and the heroic Decepticons. After being shot by Optimus Prime for being a traitor, he is recovered by the Decepticons and joins their cause. He and his glass gas is key to the destruction of the launch pad to the Ark - a space ship the Autobots plan to use to conquer Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite comic |colorist=Espen Grundetjern |date=Botcon 2008 |editor=Pete Sinclair &amp; Brian Savage |inker=[[Don Figueroa]] |issue=3 |letterer=Jesse Wittenrich |penciller=Don Figueroa |publisher=Fun Publications |story=Shattered Glass |title=Transformers Timelines |volume=2 |writer=Pete Sinclair &amp; Benson Yee}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cliffjumper appears in the fiction ''[[Dungeons &amp; Dinobots]]'', a text based story. He defends the [[Arch-Ayr]] fuel dump with the Decepticons from an Autobot attack. He later captures the [[Dinobots]] [[Slugfest (Transformers)|Slugfest]] and [[Goryu]] for the Decepticons to reprogram as Dinocons. Cliffjumper, [[Sideswipe (Transformers)|Sideswipe]], [[Blurr]] and [[Rodimus]] then track [[Grimlock]] through a maze of traps and discover the [[Omega Terminus]]. A trap separates him with Sideswipe, leaving him to survive with Rodimus. Cliffjumper refuses to be part of Rodimus' plan to use the Terminus to create an army to take over Cybertron. After a run-in with Grimlock and zombified versions of Cliffjumper's evil counterpart and Sideswipe's old commander Drench, they escape the maze.

Cliffjumper appears in the story ''[[Do Over (Transformers)|Do Over]]''. When Megatron is captured by the Autobot Targetmasters led by Ricochet, it is Cliffjumper who warns Starscream not to send a large force to rescue him, but instead send a small group of [[Micromasters]]. He is among the crew of the [[Nemesis (Transformers)|Nemesis]], which follows the Autobot's [[Ark (Transformers)|Ark]] to Earth before being shot down by human defenses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[S. Trent Troop]] and [[Greg Sepelak]]|title=Do Over |publisher=[[Fun Publications]]|others= Illustrator [[Yuki Oshima]]|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cliffjumper appears in ''[[Eye in the Sky (Transformers)|Eye in the Sky]]''. After meeting the Decepticons new human allies Cliffjumper warns that the Autobots probably survived the crash to Earth. He helps recover the stasis pod of Crasher and gets her back online. Cliffjumper, Crasher, [[Frenzy (Transformers)|Frenzy]], Heatwave, [[Ravage (Transformers)|Ravage]] and [[Soundwave (Transformers)|Soundwave]] are sent on a mission to [[Burpleson Air Force Base]] to stop the Autobots from controlling the Global Orbital Defense System. Heatwave uses his powers to convince the GODS transmitter to fire the weapon on itself and stop the Autobots from taking control.

Cliffjumper appears in ''Reunification'' having returned to Cybertron where he was reunited with Landquake, Skyfall and Breakaway just before [[Cyclonus]] attempts to kill Megatron at the command of [[Alpha Trion]].

==== IDW Publishing ====
Cliffjumper made his first [[IDW Publishing]] appearance in issue #3 of ''[[The Transformers: Megatron Origin]]'', mourning [[Bumper (Transformers)|Bumper]] alongside Bumblebee and [[Hubcap (Transformers)|Hubcap]].

When he next appears in Spotlight: Cliffjumper, he successfully engages an entire platoon of Decepticons single handed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Transformers Spotlight: Cliffjumper|publisher= Comic Bulletin|date=|url= http://www.comicsbulletin.com/reviews/124538492022808.htm|accessdate=2010-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Marvel Comics ====
Events specific to the Marvel U.K. Transformers comics are in ''italics''.

Cliffjumper appears in the Marvel Comics ''[[The Transformers (Marvel Comics)|Transformers]]'' comic, where his role is much the same as in the animated series. The earlier comic stories feature Cliffjumper prominently, deploying his 'glass gas' gun against unfortunate Decepticons.

''Cliffjumper works with [[Windcharger]] and [[Gears (Transformers)|Gears]] on the ''Dinobot Hunt'', charged with bringing in the [[Mental illness|mentally incapacitated]] Dinobot [[Sludge (Transformers)|Sludge]]. Unfortunately the party were victims of an ambush set up by [[Soundwave (Transformers)|Soundwave]].''

Cliffjumper returns in "Totaled!" to fight alongside hundreds of Autobots and Decepticons against the Underbase-empowered [[Starscream (Transformers)|Starscream]], and was one of the many casualties of his rampage.

===Games===
Cliffjumper is one of eight playable characters in the 1986 [[Commodore 64]] video game ''[[Transformers: The Battle to Save the Earth]]''.

=== Toys ===
*'''''Generation 1'' Mini-Car Cliffjumper''' (1984)
:One of the retroactively-called 'Pre-Transformer' toys, the Cliffjumper mold was originally designed and released in 1983 in Japan by [[Takara]] as part of the [[Micro Change]] subset of their [[Microman]] line.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | title=Totally Tubular '80s | last=Bellomo | first=Mark | year=2010 | publisher=Krause Publications| ISBN=1-4402-1282-1 | pages=112, 116}}&lt;/ref&gt; The toy was designated simply `1981 'Porsche 924' (MC-01). Its "stubby" vehicle mode proportions were designed to resemble Takara's [[Choro-Q]] toyline ([[Penny Racer]]s in the US). Following Hasbro's licensing of Takara toys for sale in the US, 'Cliffjumper' was released with the first wave of Transformers in 1984. A second side effect of the use of Takara overstock was that of a similar MicroChange mold (MC-02 Mazda Familia 1500 XG in yellow) being placed on Cliffjumper packaging. This toy was sometimes also found on [[Bumblebee (Transformers)|Bumblebee]] cards, leading to fans referring to the character as [[Bumblejumper]] (BUMBLEbee + cliffJUMPER). The name was later officially shortened by Transformer fiction to simply [[Bumper (Transformers)|Bumper]]. Cliffjumper was later remolded into the Series 3 mini-bot [[Hubcap (Transformers)|Hubcap]].
:In 1985 a special ''Listen 'N Fun'' edition of Cliffjumper was sold that included a cassette with the audio story ''Sun Raid''.
:Cliffjumper was released under a number of names in different countries ('''Carrera''' in [[Mexico]], '''Cliff''' in [[Japan]], '''Matamore''' in [[Canada]], '''Grillo''' in [[Italy]], etc) and was available in a variety of additional colors including blue, green, orange, white, gold, and silver.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tfu.info/1985/Autobot/Carerra/carerra.htm |title=Carerra (1985) - Autobot Warrior |publisher=www.tfu.info |date= |accessdate=2012-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''''Generation 1'' Mini-Car Yellow Cliffjumper''' (1984)
:Owing to Hasbro using leftover toy stock bought from the Microman line, some Cliffjumper toys were yellow (its alternate MicroChange color) instead of red.

*'''''Generation 1'' McDonald's Cliffjumper''' (1985)
:One of the four original McDonald's Happy Meal Transformers toy from 1985, this toy was just a solid blue statue of the character in robot mode.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.transformerland.com/store/show_item_froogle.php?action=show_item&amp;id=137625 |title=Complete Transformers® G1 Cliffjumper (blue and purple) |publisher=TransFormerLand}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''''Generation 1'' Keychain Cliffjumper'''
:Cliffjumper was reissued (with the addition of a keychain attachment) in his traditional red. This mold was later recolored into the convention-exclusive Transformers: Universe [[Tap-Out (Transformers)|Tap-Out]] figure.

*'''''Generation 1'' Black Keychain Cliffjumper'''
:A variant all-black color was blind packaged in Japan.

:The mold for this figure was also used for the [[BotCon]] exclusive Decepticon [[Bug Bite (Transformers)|Bugbite]].

*'''''Titanium'' 3&amp;nbsp;inch Cliffjumper''' (unreleased)
:Cliffjumper, a redeco of Bumblebee, was to be released as a 3-inch non-transforming figure in the ''Transformers: Titanium'' line in early 2007. This version of Cliffjumper does carry a gun.

*'''''Titanium'' 6&amp;nbsp;inch War Within Cliffjumper''' (unreleased)
:A prototype of a 6-inch-tall War Within Bumblebee/Cliffjumper figure was seen at a Hasbro factor tour in 2007. This figure had two different head sculpts, one for Bumblebee and one for Cliffjumper. This figure has yet to be released and seems to have been canceled.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tfw2005.com/gallery/showphoto.php/photo/18710/cat/1806 Botcon 2007 Hasbro tour - Transformers Images&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The name '''Cliffjumper''' was given to a female [[Mini-Con]] in ''[[Transformers: Armada]]''. She does not appear in any cartoon or comic-book series, although she did receive a biography in the [[Dreamwave Productions|Dreamwave]] ''More Than Meets The Eye'' comics.

Cliffjumper's bio described her as almost the polar opposite of the Generation 1 Cliffjumper - where he was brash and always ready to fight, she is quiet and reserved, seeking an end to the war so she can return to her scientific career. Sadly for her, she was stuck with [[Cheetor#Transformers: Armada|Cheetor]], her polar opposite, as a partner. A cocky type always seeking adventure, he often teased her about her name, unaware of the damage it did to her self-esteem. After he was taken as one of [[Unicron#Unicron Trilogy|Unicron]]'s four horsemen, she felt slightly relieved - almost immediately feeling guilty at the mere thought of it.

The name Cliffjumper (Overdrive in Japan) was used again in the ''[[Transformers: Energon]]'' line.

In the ''Transformers: Energon'' animated series, Cliffjumper's name was frequently swapped with fellow Autobot [[Downshift]], as they were originally mistaken for one another when they first appeared. His vehicle mode was a dune racer.

This Cliffjumper is more reminiscent of the original, as he is described as loving high-risk situations, although not the battle fervour of the original. Cliffjumper loves stunt driving, with the more risk and speed involved the better. While he is a skilled warrior, his unnecessary risk-taking has earned him more than one reprimand from [[optimus Prime (Unicron Trilogy)|Optimus Prime]].&lt;ref&gt;Figure King Magazine #74, June 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Animated series ===
Cliffjumper appeared in the ''Transformers: Energon'' series as one of the inexperienced soldiers under the command of [[Bulkhead (Transformers)#Transformers: Energon|Bulkhead]] sent into the rift caused by the collision of [[Unicron]]'s head with his body. They eventually succeeded in bringing [[Optimus Prime (Unicron Trilogy)|Optimus Prime]]'s team back to the normal universe. In the final battle, he gave his [[Spark (Transformers)|spark]] energy to empower Optimus Supreme against the Unicron-possessed [[Galvatron#Unicron Trilogy|Galvatron]].

=== Dreamwave Productions ===
Cliffjumper also appeared in the accompanying ''Energon'' comics by [[Dreamwave Productions]]. He originally came to Earth to battle the [[Terrorcon]]s, and became part of the Autobot forces permanently stationed there.

Later, he was knocked out by a surprise attack from [[Tidal Wave (Transformers)|Tidal Wave]], who further threatened his life to get [[Ironhide#Transformers: Energon|Ironhide]] to do what he wanted.

He was part of the Autobot forces in [[Los Angeles]], battling against the horde of [[Insecticons|Insecticon]] clones - until they were surprisingly bailed out by [[Megatron (Unicron Trilogy)|Megatron]]. Dreamwave's closure prevented this story from ever being completed.

Cliffjumper is the name of a character from the 2007 ''[[Transformers (film)|Transformers]]'' movie [[Transformers: The Movie toy line|toy line]].

Cliffjumper is impatient and is considered the opposite of the composed Autobot [[Bumblebee (other incarnations)#Transformers|Bumblebee]]. He'd rather take down a Decepticon by force and then try to get information from their smoldering wreckage than spy on them.&lt;ref&gt;The Reign of Starscream, Page 133 by Chris Mowry, Chris Ryall, Alex Milne, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

The Legends 2-pack with Cliffjumper and Recon [[Barricade (Transformers)#Transformers|Barricade]] says that Cliffjumper and Barricade are old rivals. Cliffjumper often taunts Barricade into making mistakes. Most of the time his taunts lead to victory.

=== IDW Publishing ===
In ''[[Transformers: Defiance]]'' #1 by [[IDW Publishing]], back on ancient Cybertron, Bumblebee and Cliffjumper were tasked to watch over the [[AllSpark#Transformers|All Spark]] at the temple at Simfur. In issue #3, [[Megatron (Transformers)#Transformers|Megatron]] learns that [[Optimus Prime (other incarnations)#The Transformers|Optimus Prime]] has broken into his room so he sends Bumblebee, Camshaft, Cliffjumper, [[Jazz (Transformers)#Transformers|Jazz]], [[Prowl (Transformers)#Transformers|Prowl]] and [[Smokescreen (Transformers)#Transformers|Smokescreen]] to arrest Optimus for treason. Optimus demands to speak directly to Megatron, but when the group is traveling to Megatron's location, they are ambushed by [[Barricade (Transformers)#Transformers|Barricade]], [[Brawl (Transformers)#Transformers (film)|Brawl]], [[Crankcase (Transformers)#Transformers|Crankcase]], [[Frenzy (Transformers)#Transformers: Prime|Frenzy]], [[Starscream]], [[Skywarp#Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen|Skywarp]] and [[Thundercracker#Transformers|Thundercracker]] - who have orders to kill the lot of them. Smokescreen is able to cover Optimus and his group's retreat in the confusion of an explosion. In issue #4 Arcee, Bumbelbee, Cliffjumper, Jazz and Smokescreen ambush Ironhide, who they believed works for Megatron, but Ironhide instead joins Optimus Prime's Autobots.

Cliffjumper is among the Autobot forces who witness the launching of the Decepticon ship Nemesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic| writer = [[John Barber (comics)|John Barber]]| penciller =[[Andrew Griffith]] | inker = [[Priscilla Tramontano]] | title = Transformers: Foundation| volume = 1| issue = 3| date = April 2011| publisher = [[IDW Publishing]] | page = 14| panel = 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Transformers: The Reign of Starscream]]'', the Decepticon Starscream barely makes it to the ''[[Nemesis (Transformers)|Nemesis]]'' on Mars before he runs out of power. His return is noted by the Autobot [[Cosmos (Transformers)#Transformers|Cosmos]], who alerts [[Arcee#Transformers|Arcee]], Cliffjumper, Smokescreen, Camshaft and [[Air Raid (Transformers)#Transformers|Air Raid]]. Aided by Thundercracker on the ''Nemesis'', Starscream recovers and sends the information on the Allspark Frenzy had gathered back to Cybertron just as Hardtop spots the Autobots closing on the ''Nemesis''. In issue #3, Cliffjumper is shot in the back by Starscream.

Unlike the other Autobots who were clearly shown to have been killed, Cliffjumper's status was ambiguous in the actual fiction. [[Chris Mowry]] says he survived, however.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tfw2005.com/boards/members/mowry-73165.html#vmessage168039&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Barber (comics)|John Barber]] sneakily alluded to it years later for "Convergence".

*'''''Transformers'' 3D Battle Card Game Cliffjumper''' (2007)
:Cliffjumper is among the characters which appeared in the 1st wave of [[Transformers 3D Battle Card Game]] by [[Wizards of the Coast]]. Unlike most versions of Cliffjumper for the movie, where he is a red repaint of movie 2007 Bumblebee. The Cliffjumper card looks nearly identical to Alternators Swerve, with the addition of 2007 movie style exposed facial robotics and joints. His vehicle mode is a [[Chevrolet Corvette C6]]. Oddly, a Swerve card was released, which was a red redeco of Bumblebee - leading some to think their cards were swapped.

*'''''Transformers'' Deluxe Class Cliffjumper''' (2008)
:A red repaint of Concept Camaro Bumblebee. This Deluxe toy features Automorph technology and a complex transformation. Comes with a laser cannon that opens to become a clear blue blade. This toy is about 14 centimeters long in vehicle mode. With a real Concept Camaro being 473 centimeters long this toy has a scale of about 1/34. With the toy standing 16 centimeters tall in robot mode, the real robot would stand about 18 feet tall. Curiously, the toy has been misprinted on promotional images: it depicts Cliffjumper with splodges of All Spark blue on his thighs, when there is none there. Also, it has something similar to Bumblebee: the front end of his feet are black; however, there is no black. Like Megatron, the promo images have errors overall.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hasbro.com/transformers/default.cfm?page=News/Item&amp;newsid=5D9D9C04-D56F-E112-439E9813AA28B47F transformers-fr_FR - default&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011003342/http://www.hasbro.com/transformers/default.cfm?page=News%2FItem&amp;newsID=5D9D9C04-D56F-E112-439E9813AA28B47F |date=2007-10-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of his temper, Cliffjumper has never been much of a spy. Even though he works in Intelligence, he does not interact much with the enemy. Instead, he collects information from field agents and finds the important bits for his superiors. Of course, knowing everything there is to know about the Decepticons makes him a little tense, which is why he's always ready for a fight.

=== Animated series ===
In the ''[[Transformers Animated]]'' episode "Autoboot Camp", an Autobot similar in appearance to [[Bumblebee (Transformers Animated)|Bumblebee]], but taller, and with longer horns and a red and gray color scheme, is featured. Although not named, series artist [[Derrick J. Wyatt]] confirmed that the character is Cliffjumper.

He makes a reappearance in the season 3 opener, "Transwarped", where he gets to speak. He speaks when telling [[Longarm (Transformers)#Transformers Animated|Longarm Prime]]/[[Shockwave (Transformers)#Transformers Animated|Shockwave]] that, per Ultra Magnus's orders, the Space Bridge Nexus is to be shut down due to the Decepticons trying to transwarp to Cybertron. He then appears outside Longarm/Shockwave's office, told by Longarm to dispose of a cube that was once [[Blurr#Transformers Animated|Blurr]], being told it was "sensitive materials."

Cliffjumper appeared again in "Five Servos of Doom" where he is contacted by [[Optimus Prime (other incarnations)#Transformers Animated|Optimus Prime]], [[Sentinel Prime#Transformers Animated|Sentinel Prime]], [[Jetfire#Transformers: Animated|Jetfire]], and [[Jetstorm#Transformers Animated|Jetstorm]]. He told the Earth bound Autobots that about "50 megacycles ago, [[Ultra Magnus (other incarnations)#Transformers Animated|Ultra Magnus]] was attacked by the Decepticon traitor Shockwave." He then goes on to say that Ultra Magnus is "... in recovery, but Shockwave got away with his Magnus hammer and did a number on the communications systems." He then gets told that [[Prowl (Transformers)#Transformers Animated|Prowl]] has captured many of [[Megatron (Transformers)#Transformers Animated|Megatron's]] top soldiers. He later appears alongside Alpha Trion and Preceptor in a transmission to Sentinel Prime concerning the laters return to Cybertron. Cliffjumper taunts Sentinel by saying that "he thought it was Prowl" when Sentinel attempts to take credit for capturing Megatron's soldiers. He was also seen in "Endgame Part 2" when Optimus Prime and his team captured Megatron, Shockwave, and Lugnut.

This Cliffjumper is the counterpart of ''Generation 1'' Cliffjumper in the ''Shattered Glass'' mirror-universe storyline. He is blue instead of red, and well as being evil like the Autobots in this timeline. His friends described him as being overly trusting. He died before the ''Generation 1'' Cliffjumper arrived on his world, and G1 Cliffjumper was mistaken for his counterpart until the truth became known.

Cliffjumper appeared in the 2010 computer animated series ''[[Transformers: Prime]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tfw2005.com/transformers-news/transformers-prime-39/botcon-2010-transformers-prime-panel-coverage-170054/ TFW2005.com - BotCon 2010 ''Transformers: Prime'' Panel Coverage]&lt;/ref&gt; His Earth form is a red second-generation [[Dodge Challenger#First generation (1970–1974)|Dodge Challenger]] decorated with bull horns on the hood. Unlike the previous versions of Cliffjumper he is not a recolor of Bumblebee, however he was in the ''War for/Fall of Cybertron'' video games, however in the animated series when the Autobots change into Earth-based vehicles their appearance changes completely except for Cliffjumper, whose Cybertronian robot mode remained when he was a Dodge Challenger for unknown reasons.

===Animated series===
Cliffjumper first appears in the first two episodes of the ''Transformers: Prime'' 5-part mini-series ''Darkness Rising.'' Outside of Jasper, Nevada, Cliffjumper tells [[Arcee#Transformers: Prime|Arcee]] how he got a [[Wheel clamp|boot]] from human police officers for being parked illegally, and scared the officers by kicking it off and driving by. He soon discovers a deposit of Energon and is attacked by Vehicons, destroying the Energon during the one-sided fight before being captured. He is taken before [[Starscream (Transformers)#Transformers: Prime|Starscream]], who fatally stabs the Autobot in the chest when Cliffjumper asks where Starscream's master is. Cliffjumper's lifeless body is later used by [[Megatron (Transformers)#Transformers: Prime|Megatron]] to test the Dark Energon he obtained, reanimating the Autobot into a mindless beast before being sliced in half and later falling to his death.&lt;ref&gt;Transformers Prime episodes #1 and 2 "Darkness Rising Parts 1 and 2"&lt;/ref&gt;

In "Predatory", Airachnid mentioned to Arcee the deaths of Cliffjumper and [[Tailgate (Transformers)|Tailgate]], whom were both her partners and suggested Arcee was the reason they died. Also Cliffjumper is seen in one of the flashback's rescuing Arcee with Bumblebee as they saved her from Airachnid on Cybertron. In "Partners", Arcee discovers that it was Starscream who killed Cliffjumper, and attempts to take revenge by forcing Starscream into a fight despite his surrender. In "Stronger, Faster", Cliffjumper was mentioned by Ratchet, as he blamed Optimus's beliefs in protecting humanity for causing Cliffjumper's demise, infuriating Arcee.

In "Out of the Past," a flashback showed that Cliffjumper and Arcee had been captured by Starscream in his plot to force them into decoding a cryptic Autobot message at the time when Arcee didn't know Cliffjumper. Upon being imprisoned, Cliffjumper is asked by Arcee about how he got captured. Cliffjumper states that he intercepted some Decepticon message where Starscream was delivering Energon to Shockwave. In order to get the encryption from Arcee and Cliffjumper, Starscream brings them to Kaon to let Shockwave extract it from them. When Shockwave plans to dispose of Cliffjumper, Starscream tells Shockwave the Cliffjumper is his. Shockwave acknowledges Starscream's orders and leaves. Before Starscream can finish off Cliffjumper, Arcee breaks free and frees Cliffjumper while trapping Starscream. Arcee and Cliffjumper learn from Starscream that Shockwave is using the Energon to build a Space Bridge. While heading towards Shockwave, Cliffjumper tells Arcee that he knows what Airachnid did to Tailgate. Arcee and Cliffjumper take out two Vehicon guards at the Space Bridge where the Decepticons can use the Space Bridge to get to Earth before Autobot reinforcements can arrive. Cliffjumper distracts two more Vehicons while Arcee sabotages the Space Bridge. After knocking out Shockwave, Arcee and Cliffjumper are attacked. Arcee and Cliffjumper escape into the Space Bridge before it explodes. When Shockwave tries to follow them, Arcee manages to shoot Shockwave in the head as Arcee and Cliffjumper successfully arrive on Earth. Before leaving to find Optimus Prime, Arcee and Cliffjumper are left wondering if Shockwave survived the Space Bridge's explosion.

'''''Codex Seraphinianus''''',&lt;ref&gt;as it were "the book (or manuscript) of Serafini";
the Latin noun ''[[codex]]'' referred to a book with pages (as opposed to a scroll), and is often applied in modern usage to a [[manuscript]] with pages, especially an [[antiquarian]] one. ''Seraphinianus'' is a [[Latinisation of names|Latinisation]] of the author's surname, Serafini (which in Italian, refers to the [[seraph]]s).&lt;/ref&gt; originally published in 1981, is an illustrated [[encyclopedia]] of an imaginary world, created by Italian artist, architect and industrial designer [[Luigi Serafini (artist)|Luigi Serafini]] during 30 months from 1976 to 1978.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Corrias, Pino |url=http://download.repubblica.it/pdf/domenica/2006/05022006.pdf |title=L'enciclopedia dell'altro mondo |publisher=''La Repubblica'' |date=February 5, 2006 |page= 39 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is approximately 360 pages (depending on edition) and written in a cipher alphabet&lt;ref name=hidden&gt;{{cite book |last=Berloquin |first=Pierre |title=Hidden Codes &amp; Grand Designs: Secret Languages from Ancient Times to Modern Day |publisher=[[Sterling Publishing]] |year=2008 |pages=300–302 |chapter=Chapter 10: The Cipher Gallery |isbn=1-4027-2833-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; in a [[constructed language]].&lt;ref name=ttot&gt;{{cite book |title=The Tears of Things: Melancholy and Physical Objects |year=2006 |publisher=University of Minnesota Press |isbn=0-8166-4631-7 |author=Peter Schwenger |chapter=Museal |pages=119–124}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally published in Italy, it has been released in several countries.&lt;ref name=ttot /&gt;

==Description==

The '''''Codex''''' is an encyclopedia in [[manuscript]] with copious hand-drawn, colored-pencil illustrations of bizarre and fantastical [[flora]], [[fauna]], anatomies, fashions, and foods.&lt;ref name=enfic&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Fictional and Fantastic Languages |title=Codex Seraphinianus |author=Tim Conley |author2=[[Stephen Cain (poet)|Stephen Cain]] |year=2006 |publisher=[[Greenwood Publishing Group]] |isbn=0-313-33188-X |pages=30–31}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been compared to the still undeciphered [[Voynich manuscript]],&lt;ref name=hidden /&gt; the story "[[Tlön, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius]]" by [[Jorge Luis Borges]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Codex Seraphinianus |url=http://fictive.arts.uci.edu/codex_seraphinianus |author=Antoinette LaFarge |publisher=[[University of California, Irvine]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the artwork of [[M. C. Escher#Works|M. C. Escher]]&lt;ref name=searles /&gt; and [[Hieronymus Bosch]].&lt;ref name=ttot /&gt;&lt;ref name=enfic /&gt;

The illustrations are often [[Surrealism|surreal]]&lt;ref name=enfic /&gt;&lt;ref name=searles /&gt;&lt;ref name=wildb /&gt; [[parody|parodies]] of things in the real world, such as a bleeding fruit, a plant that grows into roughly the shape of a chair and is subsequently made into one, a copulating couple that metamorphoses into an [[alligator]]. Others depict odd, apparently senseless machines, often with delicate appearances and bound by tiny filaments. Some illustrations are recognizable as maps or human faces; while others (especially in the "physics" chapter) are mostly or totally abstract.&lt;ref name=ttot /&gt; Nearly all of the illustrations are brightly coloured and highly detailed.

==Writing system==

The writing system (possibly a [[false writing system|false one]]) appears modeled on Western writing systems, with left-to-right writing in rows and an alphabet with [[majuscule letter|uppercase]] and [[minuscule letter|lowercase]] letters, some of which double as numerals. Some letters appear only at the beginning or end of words, similarly to [[Semitic languages|Semitic]] writing systems. The [[curvilinear]] letters are rope- or thread-like, with loops and even knots,&lt;ref name=hidden /&gt; and are somewhat reminiscent of [[Sinhalese script]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Lost Classics |year=2003 |publisher=[[Bloomsbury Publishing]] |isbn=0-7475-6175-3 |author=[[Christian Bök]] |editor=[[Michael Ondaatje]] |chapter=Codex Seraphinianus}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book's "language" has defied analysis for decades. The page-numbering system, however, has been cracked (apparently independently) by Allan C. Wechsler&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/rec.arts.books/iZjm-ndNW30/HTyQcXdb5SUJ |title=rec.arts.books: Codex Seraphinianus |publisher=Groups.google.com |accessdate=2014-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Bulgarian linguist Ivan Derzhanski,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.math.bas.bg/~iad/serafin.html |author=Ivan A. Derzhanski |title=Codex Seraphinianus: Some Observations |publisher=Math.bas.bg |date=2004-09-29 |accessdate=2014-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; among others, and is a variation of [[Positional notation#Base of the numeral system|base 21]].&lt;ref name=hidden /&gt;

In a talk at the [[Oxford University Society of Bibliophiles]] on 11 May 2009, Serafini stated that there is no meaning behind the ''Codex''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'s script, which is [[asemic writing|asemic]]; that his experience in writing it was similar to [[automatic writing]]; and that what he wanted his alphabet to convey was the sensation children feel with books they cannot yet understand, although they see that the writing makes sense for adults.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://repository.lib.ncsu.edu/ir/bitstream/1840.16/6460/1/etd.pdf |author=Jeff Stanley |title=To Read Images Not Words: Computer-Aided Analysis of the Handwriting in the Codex Seraphinianus (MSc dissertation) |location=North Carolina State University at Raleigh |year=2010 |pages=8–9 |accessdate=9 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contents==

The book is in eleven chapters, in two sections. The first section appears to describe the natural world of flora, fauna and physics. The second deals with various aspects of human life, including garments, history, cuisine and architecture. Each chapter seems to address a general encyclopedic topic, as follows:

# Types of flora: strange flowers, trees that uproot themselves and migrate, etc.
# Fauna (animals), including surreal variations of the [[horse]], [[hippopotamus]], [[rhinoceros]] and [[bird]]s
# An apparently separate [[Kingdom (biology)|kingdom]] of odd [[bipedal]] creatures
# [[Physics]] and [[chemistry]] (generally considered the most abstract, enigmatic chapter)
# Bizarre machines and vehicles
# The humanities:  biology, sexuality, [[Indigenous peoples|aboriginal]] peoples, including some examples with plant life and tools (e.g. pens, wrenches) grafted onto the human body
# History: people (some only vaguely human) of unknown significance, with their times of birth and death; scenes of historical and possibly religious significance; burial and funereal customs
# The history of the Codex's writing system
# Food, dining practices, garments
# Bizarre games, including cards, board games and athletic sports
# [[Architecture]]

After the last chapter is a table of contents or index, followed by an apparent [[afterword]] whose writing is more casually rendered.&lt;ref name=ttot /&gt;

Two plates in the sixth chapter contain lines of French text, a quote from [[Marcel Proust]]'s "[[In Search of Lost Time|A la recherche du temps perdu: Albertine disparue]]" (''In Search of Lost Time: Albertine Gone''). The words scattered on the floor of the illustration are from the same book.

==Reception==

[[Baird Searles]], in ''[[Asimov's Science Fiction]]'' (April 1984), says "the book lies in the uneasy boundary between [[surrealism]] and fantasy, given an odd literary status by its masquerade as a book of fact".&lt;ref name=searles&gt;[[Baird Searles]] (April 1984). [[Asimov's Science Fiction]].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Douglas R. Hofstadter]], in ''[[Metamagical Themas: Questing for the Essence of Mind and Pattern]]'', finds many of the illustrations "grotesque and disturbing" and others "extremely beautiful and visionary". He says the book "seems to [some people] to glorify [[entropy]], chaos, and incomprehensibility".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Douglas R. Hofstadter]] |title=[[Metamagical Themas|Metamagical Themas: Questing for the Essence of Mind and Pattern]] |publisher=[[Basic Books]] |year=1985 |page=229}}&lt;/ref&gt;

American journalist [[Jim Dwyer (journalist)|Jim Dwyer]] finds that the work is an early critique of the [[Information Age]].&lt;ref name=wildb&gt;{{cite book |title=Where The Wild Books Are: A Field Guide to Ecofiction |year=2010 |publisher=[[University of Nevada Press]] |isbn=978-0-87417-811-1 |author=[[Jim Dwyer (journalist)|Jim Dwyer]] |page=91}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If the encyclopedia tends to fix the knowledge of a certain era, in Serafini's "fantaencyclopedia" there is nothing solid. According to Italo Calvino, the skeleton is "the only nucleus of reality which endures in the same way in this world full of interchangeable shapes". For this ironic and involving variability, the Codex Seraphinianus keeps in touch with the psychic area and establish an attempt of "contradictory world's cataloguing of halfway shapes".&lt;ref&gt;Alessandro Paolo Lombardo, [http://www.artribune.com/2014/10/sul-codex-seraphinianus-di-luigi-serafini-che-ora-diventa-un-film/ ''Sul Codex Seraphinianus di Luigi Serafini.

{{Paranormal |state=collapsed}}

'''Cold reading''' is a set of techniques used by [[Mentalism|mentalists]], [[psychic]]s, [[Fortune-telling|fortune-tellers]], [[mediumship|mediums]], [[Magic (illusion)|illusionists]] (readers), and [[Confidence trick|scam artists]] to imply  that the reader knows much more about the person than the reader actually does.&lt;ref name="Dutton1988"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Dutton | first = Denis|authorlink=Denis Dutton | year = 1988 | title = The cold reading technique | journal = Experientia | volume = 44 | issue = 4 | pages = 326–32 | url = http://www.denisdutton.com/cold_reading.htm | accessdate = June 30, 2009 | doi = 10.1007/BF01961271 | pmid = 3360083 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Without prior knowledge, a practiced cold-reader can quickly obtain a great deal of information by analyzing the person's [[body language]], [[Ageing|age]], [[clothing]] or [[fashion]], [[hairstyle]], [[gender]], [[sexual orientation]], [[religion]], [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]] or [[ethnicity]], level of [[education]],  [[Idiolect|manner of speech]], place of origin, etc. Cold readings commonly employ high-probability guesses, quickly picking up on signals as to whether their guesses are in the right direction or not, then emphasizing and reinforcing chance connections and quickly moving on from missed guesses. Psychologists believe that this appears to work because of the [[Forer effect]] and due to [[Confirmation bias|confirmation biases]] within people.&lt;ref&gt;Forer, BR (1949) [http://apsychoserver.psych.arizona.edu/JJBAReprints/PSYC621/Forer_The%20fallacy%20of%20personal%20validation_1949.pdf "The fallacy of personal validation: A classroom demonstration of gullibility"]. ''Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology''. 44, 118–23&lt;/ref&gt;

== Basic procedure ==
Before starting the actual reading, the reader will typically try to elicit cooperation from the subject, saying something such as, "I often see images that are a bit unclear and which may sometimes mean more to you than to me; if you help, we can together uncover new things about you." One of the most crucial elements of a convincing cold reading is a subject eager to make connections or reinterpret vague statements in any way that will help the reader appear to make specific predictions or intuitions. While the reader will do most of the talking, it is the subject who provides the meaning.

After determining that the subject is cooperative, the reader will make a number of probing statements or questions, typically using variations of the methods noted below. The subject will then reveal further information with their replies (whether verbal or non-verbal) and the cold reader can continue from there, pursuing promising lines of inquiry and quickly abandoning or avoiding unproductive ones. In general, while revelations seem to come from the reader, most of the facts and statements come from the subject, which are then refined and restated by the reader so as to reinforce the idea that the reader got something correct.

Subtle cues such as changes in [[facial expression]] or [[body language]] can indicate whether a particular line of questioning is effective or not. Combining the techniques of cold reading with information obtained covertly (also called "[[hot reading]]") can leave a strong impression that the reader knows or has access to a great deal of information about the subject. Because the majority of time during a reading is spent dwelling on the "hits" the reader obtains, while the time spent recognizing "misses" is minimized, the effect gives an impression that the cold reader knows far more about the subject than an ordinary stranger could.

[[James Underdown]] from [[Center for Inquiry]] and [[Independent Investigations Group]] said, "In the context of a studio audience full of people, cold reading is not very impressive." Underdown explains cold-reading from a mathematical viewpoint. A typical studio audience consists of approximately 200 people, divided up into three sections. A conservative estimate assumes each person knows 150 people. Underdown says:

{{quote|This means that when John Edward or James Van Praagh asks the question "Who's Margaret?" he is hoping there is a Margaret in the 10,000 people in the database of that section. If there is no answer, they open the question up to the whole audience's database of over 30,000 people! Would it be surprising for there to be a dozen Margarets in such a large sample?&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Underdown|first1=James|authorlink=James Underdown |title=They See Dead People – Or Do They?: An Investigation of Television Mediums|url=http://www.csicop.org/si/show/they_see_dead_people_-_or_do_they_an_investigation_of_television_mediums/|website=CSI|publisher=[[Skeptical Inquirer]]|accessdate=July 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Mentalist [[Mark Edward]] relates from personal experience as a "psychic performer" how powerful a hit can be when someone in a large audience "claims" a phrase such as a "clown in a graveyard" statement. Edward describes a mental image of a clown placing flowers on graves and adds, "Does that mean anything to someone?" whereupon a woman stands up and claims that he is speaking directly to her. She remembers it as Edward specifically stating that ''she'' knew a man who dressed as a clown and placed flowers on graves in her hometown. Edward reports that it took some convincing to get her to understand that he was ''not'' directly talking to her, but had thrown the statement out to the entire audience of 300 people. She made the connection, and because it seemed so personal and the situation so odd she felt that he was talking to her directly.&lt;ref name="Graveyard"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Edward|first1=Mark|authorlink=Mark Edward|title=The Clown in the Graveyard|url=http://www.csicop.org/specialarticles/show/the_clown_in_the_graveyard|website=Skeptical Inquirer|publisher=Center for Inquiry|accessdate=22 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Specific techniques ==
=== Shotgunning ===
"Shotgunning" is a commonly used cold reading technique. This technique is named after the manner in which a [[shotgun]] fires a cluster of small projectiles in the hope that one or more of them will strike the target.

The cold reader slowly offers a huge quantity of very general information, often to an entire audience (some of which is very likely to be correct, near correct or at the very least, provocative or evocative to someone present), observes their subjects' reactions (especially their body language), and then narrows the scope, acknowledging particular people or concepts and refining the original statements according to those reactions to promote an emotional response. A majority of people in a room will, at some point for example, have lost an older relative or known at least one person with a common name like "Mike" or "John".

Shotgunning might include a series of vague statements such as:
;"I see a heart problem with a father-figure in your family."
:A vast variety of medical problems have chest pain as a symptom, and heart disease is the leading cause of death worldwide. "Father-figure" can refer to somebody's father, grandfather, uncle, cousin, or any male relative who is also a parent.
;"I see a woman with blackness in the chest, lung cancer, heart disease, breast cancer..."
:Most people will know a woman who was diagnosed with one of these problems, which are among the leading causes of illness and death.
;"I sense an older male figure in your life, who wants you to know while you may have had disagreements in your life, he still loved you."
:Nearly all people will have had such a person in their lives, and nearly all of them will have had a [[generation gap|disagreement]].

=== The Forer effect (Barnum statements) ===
The [[Forer effect]] relies in part on the eagerness of people to fill in details and make connections between what is said and some aspect of their own lives, often searching their entire life's history to find some connection, or reinterpreting statements in a number of different possible ways so as to make it apply to themselves.

"[[Barnum statements]]", named after [[P. T. Barnum]], the American showman, are statements that seem personal, yet apply to many people.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haP7Ys9ocTk&lt;/ref&gt; And while seemingly specific, such statements are often open-ended or give the reader the maximum amount of "wiggle room" in a reading. They are designed to elicit identifying responses from people. The statements can then be developed into longer and more sophisticated paragraphs and seem to reveal great amounts of detail about a person. A talented and charismatic reader can sometimes even bully a subject into admitting a connection, demanding over and over that they acknowledge a particular statement as having some relevance and maintaining that they are just not thinking hard enough, or are repressing some important memory.

Statements of this type might include:
* "I sense that you are sometimes insecure, especially with people you don't know very well."
* "You have a box of old unsorted photographs in your house."
* "You had an accident when you were a child involving water."
* "You're having problems with a friend or relative."
* "Your father passed on due to problems in his chest or abdomen."

Regarding the last statement, if the subject is old enough, his or her father is quite likely to have died, and this statement would easily apply to a large number of medical conditions. The list includes: [[heart disease]], [[pneumonia]], [[diabetes]], [[emphysema]], [[cirrhosis of the liver]], [[renal failure]], most types of [[cancer]], and, for that matter, to any cause of death in which [[cardiac arrest]] precedes death, or damage to the [[brainstem]] responsible for cardiopulmonary function.

==== Warm reading ====

Warm reading is a performance tool used by professional [[mentalists]] and psychic [[confidence trick|scam artists]].&lt;ref&gt;Huston, Peter. (2002). ''More Scams from the Great Beyond!: How to Make Even More Money Off the Creationism, Evolution, Environmentalism, Fringe Politics, Weird Science, the Occult, and Other Strange Beliefs''. Paladin Press. {{ISBN|1-58160-354-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; While hot reading is the use of foreknowledge and cold reading works on reacting to the subject's responses, warm reading refers to the judicious use of [[Barnum effect]] statements.

When these psychological tricks are used properly, the statements give the impression that the mentalist, or psychic scam artist, is intuitively perceptive and psychically gifted. In reality, the statements fit nearly all of humanity, regardless of gender, personal opinions, age, epoch, culture or nationality.

[[Michael Shermer]] gives the example of jewelry worn by those in mourning. Most people in this situation will be wearing or carrying an item of jewelry with some connection to the person they have lost, but if asked directly in the context of a psychic reading whether they have such an item, the client may be shocked and assume that the reader learned the information directly from the deceased loved one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://chem.tufts.edu/science/Shermer/E-Skeptic/JohnEdwardExposed.html | title=Deconstructing The Dead | publisher=Skeptic Magazine | date=2001 | accessdate=19 May 2016 | author=Shermer, Michael}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Todd Carroll]] notes in ''[[The Skeptic's Dictionary]]'' that some would consider this to be cold reading.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Todd Carroll. [http://skepdic.com/warmreading.html "Warm Reading"]. The Skeptic's Dictionary. Retrieved 2014-02-10.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The rainbow ruse ===
The rainbow ruse is a crafted statement which simultaneously awards the subject a specific personality trait, as well as the opposite of that trait. With such a phrase, a cold reader can "cover all possibilities" and appear to have made an accurate deduction in the mind of the subject, despite the fact that a rainbow ruse statement is vague and contradictory. This technique is used since personality traits are not quantifiable, and also because nearly everybody has experienced both sides of a particular emotion at some time in their lives.

Statements of this type include:
* "Most of the time you are positive and cheerful, but there has been a time in the past when you were very upset."
* "You are a very kind and considerate person, but when somebody does something to break your trust, you feel deep-seated anger."
* "I would say that you are mostly shy and quiet, but when the mood strikes you, you can easily become the center of attention."

A cold reader can choose from a variety of personality traits, think of its opposite, and then bind the two together in a phrase, vaguely linked by factors such as mood, time, or potential.

== Contrasting claims of performers ==
The mentalist branch of the [[Stage magic|stage-magician]] community approves of "reading" as long as it is presented strictly as an artistic entertainment and one is not pretending to be psychic.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;''The Dance'' by Brad Henderson, Brad Henderson and Henderson Productions, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Some performers who use cold reading are honest about their use of the technique. [[Lynne Kelly (science writer)|Lynne Kelly]], [[Kari Coleman]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Kari Coleman |year=2001 |title=My Psychic Adventure |journal=Swift |volume=2 |issue=3&amp;4 |url=http://www.randi.org/swift/current/psychic.html |accessdate=2006-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ian Rowland]],&lt;ref name="ian" /&gt; and [[Derren Brown]]&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/view_play_list?p=55A986E56B106611&amp;playnext=1&amp;playnext_from=PL&lt;/ref&gt; have used these techniques at either private fortune-telling sessions or open forum "talking with the dead" sessions in the manner of those who claim to be genuine [[Mediumship|mediums]]. Only after receiving acclaim and applause from their audience do they reveal that they needed no psychic power for the performance, only a sound knowledge of psychology and cold reading.

In an episode of his ''Trick of the Mind'' series broadcast in March 2006, Derren Brown showed how easily people can be influenced through cold reading techniques by repeating [[Bertram Forer]]'s famous demonstration of the ''personal validation fallacy'', or ''[[Forer effect]]''.

EDITORIAL NOTES:
We need citations of denial for the three psychics named above, and any others would be welcome.
The next paragraph:
By contrast, many famous psychics, such as [[John Edward]],{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} [[Sylvia Browne]],{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} and [[Colin Fry]],{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} deny that they are employing cold reading techniques and claim that they have [[paranormal]] abilities.

Skeptics have accused some psychics and mediums of fraud. Some have even been caught while doing so. (Colin Fry is one example who can be used.)
--&gt;

==Sitter misremembering==
In a detailed review of four sittings done by medium [[Tyler Henry]], Edward and [[Susan Gerbic]] reviewed all statements made by him on the TV show ''Hollywood Medium''. In their opinion not one statement made by Henry was accurate, yet each sitter felt that their reading was highly successful. In interviews done with each sitter afterward, all four claimed specific statements made by Henry but after reviewing the show it was shown that he had not. Each sitter had misremembered the precise statement. One of many examples of this was when Henry, during a session with celebrity [[Ross Matthews]], stated "Bambi, why am I connecting to Bambi"? Matthews stated that his father who was a hunter would not shoot deer because of the movie ''[[Bambi]]''. In the post interview, Matthews stated that "it was weird that Henry knew that my father would not shoot deer because of Bambi", demonstrating that Matthews had misremembered what Henry had said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gerbic|first1=Susan|authorlink=Susan Gerbic|first2=Mark|last2=Edward|title=Tip the Canoe of Tyler Too!|url=http://www.csicop.org/specialarticles/show/tip_the_canoe_of_tyler_too|website=Skeptical Inquirer|publisher=Center for Inquiry|accessdate=22 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gerbic has pointed out the broader issue of the human brain attempting to make connections that then make it appear that the psychic was correct. She lists this among a number of techniques or situations that psychics take advantage of.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gerbic|first1=Susan|title=Ten Tricks of the Psychics I Bet You Didn’t Know|url=https://www.csicop.org/specialarticles/show/ten_tricks_of_the_psychics_i_bet_you_didnrsquot_know|website=CSI|publisher=Committee for Skeptical Inquiry|accessdate=23 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Subconscious cold reading ==
Former [[New Age]] practitioner [[Karla McLaren]] has spoken about developing a system of cold reading without realising, saying in a 2004 interview that "I didn't understand that I had long used a form of cold reading in my own work! I was never taught cold reading and I never intended to defraud anyone; I simply picked up the technique through cultural osmosis." McLaren has said that since she was always very perceptive, she could easily figure out many of the issues that people brought into sessions with them. In order to reduce the appearance of unusual expertise that might have created a power differential, she posed her observations as questions rather than facts. This attempt to be polite, she realized, actually invited the other person, as McLaren has said, to "lean into the reading" and give her more pertinent information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Karla McLaren |date=May 2004 |title=Bridging the Chasm between Two Cultures |journal=Skeptical Inquirer |url=http://www.csicop.org/si/show/bridging_the_chasm_between_two_cultures |accessdate=2012-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After some people have performed hundreds of readings, their skills may improve to the point where they may start believing they can read minds. They may ask themselves if their success is because of psychology, intuition or a psychic ability.&lt;ref&gt;'' Paramiracles'' by Ted Lesley, Hermetic Press, 1994&lt;/ref&gt; This point of thought is known by some skeptics of the paranormal as the "transcendental temptation".&lt;ref&gt;''The Transcendental Temptation'' by Paul Kurtz, Prometheus books, 1986&lt;/ref&gt; Magic historian and occult investigator [[Milbourne Christopher]] has warned that the transcendental choice may lead one unknowingly into a belief in the occult and a deterioration of reason.&lt;ref&gt;''ESP, Seers &amp; Psychics: What the Occult Really is'' by Milbourne Christopher, Thomas Y. Crowell Co., 1970&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9134">'''Connectivity''' refers broadly to social connections forged through mediated communications systems. That is, 'since the arrival of the World Wide Web and the spread of mobile communications, mediated connectivity has been quietly normalized as central to a consolidating ‘global imaginary’&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | year=2016 | last1= James | first1= Paul | | authorlink1= Paul James (academic) | last2=

&lt;/ref&gt; One aspect of this is the ability of the [[social media]] to accumulate [[economic capital]] from the users' connections and activities on social media platforms by using certain mechanisms in their architecture.&lt;ref name="culture"/&gt; According to several scholars ([[José van Dijck|van Dijck]] and Poell) "it is a key element of social media logic, having a material and metaphorical importance in social media culture".&lt;ref name="strategy"&gt;[http://nms.sagepub.com/content/16/7/1169.full Light, B., Cassidy, E.(2014) : Strategies for the suspension and prevention of connection: Rendering disconnection as socioeconomic lubricant with Facebook. New Media &amp; Society 16(7): 1169-1184 ]&lt;/ref&gt; This concept originates from the technological term of "[[Internet access|connectivity]]" but its application to the media field has acquired additional social and cultural implications.&lt;ref name="facebook"/&gt;&lt;ref name="creative"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=van Dijck |first1=José |last2=Poell |first2=Thomas |title=Understanding social media logic |journal=Media and Communication |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=2–14 |doi=10.17645/mac.v1i1.70 |url=https://www.cogitatiopress.com/mediaandcommunication/article/view/70 |accessdate=4 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The increasing role of social media in everyday life serves as the basis of such connectivity in the 21st century. It shows the interrelations between the users activities on social media and at the same time the empowerment of the social media platforms with the data that was produced by the users and given to those services for granted.

==Notion of connectivity==
Connectivity developed with the rise of the Internet, first with the introduction Web 1.0 and later [[Web 2.0]]. New improvements in equipment, software, the advancement of speed and access have increased the level and quality of connectivity. Along with these improvements, new media such as social networking systems (e.g. [[Facebook]], [[Twitter]], [[Google+]]), websites that provide access to [[user-generated content]] (e.g. [[YouTube|Youtube]], [[Myspace]], [[Flickr]]), trading and marketing sites (e.g. [[Amazon.com|Amazon]], [[eBay]], [[Groupon]]) and also game sites (e.g. [[FarmVille]], The Sims Social) have become an essential part of everyday life of an average user:&lt;ref name="culture"/&gt; "Just as electricity in the 19th and 20th centuries transformed societies by penetrating every fibre of people’s personal and professional lives, network connectivity is probably the most powerful transformative force in early 21st-century cultures".&lt;ref name="facebook"&gt;[http://con.sagepub.com/content/19/2/141.full.pdf+html van Dijck, José.(2012) Facebook and the engineering of connectivity: A multi-layered approach to social media platforms]&lt;/ref&gt; This made a shift in the understanding of the nature of connectivity and moved the initial focus just from a technical side of the notion to its increasingly acquired techno-socio-cultural character.&lt;ref name="facebook"/&gt;&lt;ref name="creative"/&gt; 

As mentioned before, connectivity is built on the principles of [[Web 2.0]]. that promote an openness, create the vision of empowerment of the user in the generation of a new content and coordination of the information flow on the Internet. These mechanisms encourage staying in touch with each other despite distances and share as much data as possible. According to Youngs, the development of the Internet has resulted in the deeper permeation of [[Information and communications technology|ICT]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s into public and private spheres of peoples' life, their relationships and spheres of identity.&lt;ref name="creative"&gt;[https://books.google.nl/books?id=RkzEzSU4Qq4C&amp;pg=PA142&amp;lpg=PA142&amp;dq=Society+on+the+Line:+Information+Politics+in+the+Digital+Age&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=aNdC8f8nKe&amp;sig=0im9Qz48kvfyIV_XJCGIS1xC6ZY&amp;hl=ru&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CFUQ6AEwCGoVChMIj5uqnoTRyAIVwbYaCh37KQtx#v=onepage&amp;q=Society%20on%20the%20Line%3A%20Information%20Politics%20in%20the%20Digital%20Age&amp;f=false Youngs, Gillian.(2013) Digital world: Connectivity, Creativity and Rights]&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, connectivity becomes a resource of maintaining these activities. However, van Dijck notices that this connectivity is not just a neutral feature of new media, but is manufactured by the combination of human and technological resources, where the role of technologies is intransparent. Algorithms and protocols that are part of such platforms prompt users activities and online experiences on social media platforms. One of the most prominent activities on social media includes sharing and as Kennedy argues, "sharing rhetoric draws on a cultural image of connectivity. Social media platforms are not the only actors to use such imagining, mobile-based platforms do the same. Network providers, handset manufacturers, and social media platforms each promote social activities of togetherness enabled by their products which evidences a sustained cultural norm of sharing through teletechnologies for the purpose of affective connectivity".&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, J.(2011) [https://www.academia.edu/4472185/Rhetorics_of_Sharing_Imagination_data_and_desire Rhetorics of Sharing: Data, Imagination, and Desire], In: Lovink, G. and M.Rash (eds.) Unlike Us Reader. Social Media Monopolies and their Alternatives, pp. 127-136.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, such architecture creates even bigger demand in connectivity that is continuously exploited by the online market. As [[José van Dijck]] notices, connectivity quickly assumed the connotation of users accumulating social capital, while in fact this term increasingly referred to owners amassing economic capital. As the result, social media gain political and economic importance having the power at the levels of grassroots activists, governments, and corporations.&lt;ref name="culture"&gt;[https://www.dawsonera.com/abstract/9780199970797 van Dijck, José.(2013) The culture of connectivity: a critical history of social media]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Example of the application of connectivity ==
Facebook can serve as a good example how connectivity is being produced and exploited by social media. Van Dijck mentions three concepts implemented in the technological side of connectivity which result in the connective structure of the platform and in the creation of its additional social and cultural dimensions. These are platform, protocol and interface.&lt;ref name="facebook"/&gt;  

Several scholars (van Dijck, Gillespie) mention in their works the ambiguity of the term "platform" that promises to bring openness, access, to be neutral and help people build social connections and participate in online activities, but in fact implies a more complicated structure of the media, most of the time created for the profit purposes and as the enhancement of control under the users.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.mit.edu/comm-forum/mit6/papers/Gillespie.pdf Gillespie T (2010) The politics of platforms. New Media &amp; Society 12 (3): 347–364.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="facebook" /&gt; As for the protocols and interfaces, the algorithms behind the platform are intransparent and presented to the user as intermediaries for 'staying in touch', being connected, encouraging to make those connections, but at the same time the platform itself  "facilitates the cultivation of 'weak ties' as well as the fabrication of 'strong ties'".&lt;ref name="facebook" /&gt; Therefore, connectivity becomes a new type of social capital gained from the platform's working principles.

==Culture of connectivity==
{{See also|The Culture of Connectivity}}
"Culture of connectivity" is the term suggested by the Dutch scholar [[José van Dijck]] for defining the contemporary interweaving of the online and offline practices and the omnipresence of social media in modern life. The researcher explained the emergence of this culture as the process that evolved in a rather short period of time and indicated the shift from "networked communication to "performed" sociality, from a [[participatory culture]] to culture to connectivity". Moreover, the evolution of this culture was one of the parts of the changing processes that took place in private, corporate and public domains.&lt;ref name="culture"/&gt;

[[File:Freeing HK.jpg|thumbnail|right|Freeing HK]]
'''Freeing HK''' (Chinese: 逃出香港) is a [[real life escape game]] and the first [[room escape]] based game company in [[Hong Kong]] which was founded by four Post 80s and 90s in 2012. Players are given a scenario and have to break out of a locked room within 45 minutes, and each player can only enter each themed room once.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yp.scmp.com/home/website/article.aspx?id=4831 Four Hongkongers have turned a popular phone game into a real-life challenge for spirited souls] SCMP, Retrieved 2012-12-17&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Front door of Mong Kok branch.jpg|thumbnail|right|Front door of Mong Kok branch]]
Founded in 2012, Freeing HK is the city’s first room escape game. It was set up by a group of four friends, including a business student from [[The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology|HKUST]] called Raymond Sze Wai-hang and a business man called Instant Wan Sze-tang. Freeing HK aims at providing “an alternative to the usual entertainments such as shopping, karaoke or watching movies, which Hong Kong people are so tired of”. It also symbolizes escaping from boring Hong Kong.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scmp.com/magazines/post-magazine/article/1088242/something-new-great-escape The great escape] Post Magazine, Retrieved 2012-11-25&lt;/ref&gt;

==Significance==
In these years, the phenomenon “Hong Kong Kid” frequently hits the headlines stating that Hong Kong youngsters have low emotional intelligence and are vulnerable to adversity.  “The game can help participants enhance their problem-solving skills and learn to stand still when facing challenges”, said one of the founders, Raymond Sze Wai-hang.&lt;ref&gt;[http://std.stheadline.com/yesterday/edu/0911go05.html Freeing HK adopts the new 3-D technology introduced by CityU] SING TAO, Retrieved 2013-09-11&lt;/ref&gt; Amid the game, participants are locked up in a room and there is only one way to escape which is to figure out the correlation between clues and solve all the questions by themselves. Skills like the way to fire up imagination, solve problems and communicate with teammates thus can be learnt throughout the activity.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rTfXpb90KHs 20131003 BBC HONG KONG gamers escaping reality] BBC, Retrieved 2013-10-03&lt;/ref&gt;

Freeing HK is a local real-life game established by four young people. By the time they wanted to actualize their ideas, negative opinions and discouragement were from all around. Spending a half year on marketing, they finally started the business and had over 80,000 customers  within a year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hk.news.yahoo.com/%E4%B9%9D%E5%8D%81%E5%BE%8C-%E8%85%A6-%E6%90%9E%E4%BD%9C-220215036.html Post 90s, actualizing fantasies in the reality] SING TAO, Retrieved 2012-12-10&lt;/ref&gt; This case has aroused the public attention and has emboldened youngsters to be brave to set up a business. Recently, the team has adopted the new technology introduced by ALiVE, a laboratory of School of Creative Media of [[City University of Hong Kong]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://std.stheadline.com/yesterday/edu/0911go05.html Freeing HK adopts the new 3-D technology introduced by CityU] SING TAO, Retrieved 2013-09-11&lt;/ref&gt; For a long time, Hong Kong has been criticized for overlooking the importance of creativity. Regarding this, Freeing HK is considered as an encouragement to the public in achieving their dreams.

==Public Response==
Freeing HK has received a wide coverage from mass media since it has launched in 2012. They have been invited by national and international media for Interviews and news reports. National media included [[BBC News]] （UK）, [[TVB]] (Hong Kong), [[Now TV (China)|Now TV]] (Hong Kong) and [[Dragon TV]] (Shanghai) while International media included [[Agence France-Presse|AFP]] (France), [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]] (Canada) and [[CNN]] (US).&lt;ref&gt;[http://freeinghk.com/en/invest/ Join and invest] Freeing HK official website&lt;/ref&gt;

Over 100,000 people have experienced this real-life escape game so far.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nepg.com.hk/detail.aspx?nid=81026 Room escape game witnessed new generation's creativity] New Evening Post, Retrieved 2013-09-11&lt;/ref&gt; 80 percent of the customers aged from 15 to 25. Freeing HK was at first targeting mainly youngsters in Hong Kong. Gaining popularity among Hong Kong society, there is a growing trend in customers from office workers as well.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yp.scmp.com/home/website/article.aspx?id=4831 A fine bit of escapism] Young Post, SCMP, Retrieved 2012-12-17&lt;/ref&gt;

Beside typical walk-ins, collaboration with other companies and corporate training are within Freeing HK's services. It has so far organized corporate team building events for a wide range of companies, such as [[P&amp;G]] and [[Cathay Pacific]], with debriefing sections provided as well.&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.cntv.cn/program/china24/20131016/104918.shtml Room escape: New kind of entertainment gains popularity] CCTV, Retrieved 2013-10-16&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, Freeing HK have also involved in several charity events with local organizations, such as Evangelical Lutheran Church Social Service (Hong Kong) and [[Orbis International|Orbis]].  Freeing HK also has frequent commercial collaboration with other companies, such as [[LG]] and [[Acuvue]].

==Development==
[[File:A display board showing the locations of branches.jpg|thumbnail|right|A display board showing the locations of branches]]
The game had had 5,000 people visiting in the first three months after it launched.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/article/1148918/real-life-escape-games-offer-respite-daily-stresses Real-life escape games offer respite from daily stresses] SCMP, Retrieved 2013-02-13&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, Freeing HK had only one outlet located in [[Sai Yeung Choi Street]] South, [[Mong Kok]]. In 2013, outlets in [[Causeway Bay]] and [[Tsim Sha Tsui]] were opened respectively in April and May. In September 2013, the 4th outlet was based in [[Kwun Tong]], which is the first outlet that adopts [[Stereoscopy|3-D]] technology. Later, the [[Yuen Long]] and [[Tsuen Wan]] outlets and the first overseas outlets in [[Macau]] were launched. Freeing HK is now planning to extend their business to [[Guangzhou]].

In 2013, HK escape, another real-life room escape in Hong Kong was accused by Freeing HK of infringement of copyrights.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.stheadline.com/dailynews/content_hk/2013/03/21/230939.asp Freeing HK involving in a law case of infringement of copyrights] HK Headline, Retrieved 2013-03-21&lt;/ref&gt; Freeing HK demanded compensation and immediate injunction to stop HK escape's business.

In 2013, the Freeing SG was set up in [[Singapore]], being the largest "Freeing" flagship globally.

==Characteristics==
Freeing HK has 7 branches, 6 of them located in Hong Kong and 1 in Macau. All branches have different themes including adventure, technology, Hong Kong style, fantasy, riddle, dream and Macau style. These themed rooms are located in Causeway Bay, Kwun Tong, Mong Kok, Tsim Sha Tsui, Tsuen Wan, Yuen Long and Macau respectively.

[[File:Different themes offered by Mong Kok branch.jpg|thumbnail|right|Different themes offered by Mong Kok branch]]
In order to make the game as a tailor-made experience for [[Hongkongers]], riddles are based on knowledge of Hong Kong or stories, movies and places that local people are familiar with. The outlet in Mong Kok themed Hong Kong were built based on Hong Kong featured stories, sites, tools such as traditional toys and other collective memories in the city.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yp.scmp.com/home/website/article.aspx?id=4831 Four Hongkongers have turned a popular phone game into a real-life challenge for spirited souls] SCMP, Retrieved 2012-12-17&lt;/ref&gt; For example, one of the themed rooms is called Stalker’s Treachery, and players have to escape by crawling along the tunnel,like most local Gangster wars do.

Technologies such as 3-D animation, laser, projection and interactive [[inductor]] are employed to enhance the sense of reality and create tense atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.runrungotravel.com/?p=11893 Freeing Hong Kong, a real-life room escape game with 5D experience] Run Run Go Travel&lt;/ref&gt; Besides, [[Role-playing game]] (RPG) elements are added into the game. For example, in Kwun Tong branch which uses technology as the theme, players have to use laser to “kill” the monster; while in another themed room, 3 actors who dress like magicians will guide the players through the adventure. Freeing HK makes the real life room escape game into a 21st-century adventure.

==Plot==
According to the official synopsis, the miniseries will "reconnect with the basic elements of the show's first season" in which ordinary people discover that they have special abilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://comicbook.com/blog/2014/05/11/heroes-reborn-official-synopsis-released/|title=Heroes Reborn: Official Synopsis Released|work=Comic Book|date=May 11, 2014|accessdate=May 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A six-chapter prequel web-based series titled ''Dark Matters'' was released on July 9, 2015, to introduce the new characters and story lines.&lt;ref name="Heroes Reborn: Dark Matters"/&gt;

The series takes place one year after a terrorist attack in Odessa, Texas. The government blames those with extraordinary abilities ("Evolved humans", or "Evos"), who are forced into hiding when vigilantes systematically hunt and kill them. Two such killers, Luke and Joanne Collins, are seeking revenge for the son they lost at the Odessa bombing.

Noah Bennet is also in hiding, but is found by the conspiracy theorist Quentin Frady, who tries to show him the truth behind the Odessa tragedy.  Meanwhile, new characters are discovering their own unique abilities. In Illinois, Tommy tries to live a normal life with his dream girlfriend, Emily, after being forced to move and change his name to hide his powers. In Tokyo, Miko is looking for her missing father, but her quest to find him could prove deadly. A new hero is emerging in Los Angeles through Carlos, a former soldier whose brother (an Evo) tried to protect people with powers. Malina is an innocent teenager who, although inexperienced with her powers, has a great destiny. Meanwhile, in the shadows, Erica Kravid, the head of the highly successful tech conglomerate Renautas, has acquired Primatech with dark goals.

As the number of Evos grows, some heroes of the past, including Hiro Nakamura, Matt Parkman, Mohinder Suresh, The Haitian René, Angela Petrelli, Micah Sanders, and Molly Walker, cross paths with the new, emerging Evos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nbc.com/heroes/about|title=About|work=NBC|accessdate=15 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Together, they must save the world from a [[geomagnetic reversal]] that will leave the planet vulnerable to lethal solar radiation.

''Heroes'' creator Tim Kring said in interviews that, rather than a direct continuation, ''Heroes Reborn'' takes place considerably after the events of the original series. He stated that "This is not the fifth season, this is actually the 10th season".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/tv/showtracker/la-et-st-heroes-reborn-creator-tim-kring-talks-unfinished-business-20150813-story.html|title='Heroes Reborn' creator Tim Kring talks about 'unfinished' business|author=Yvonne Villarreal|work=Los Angeles Times|date=August 14, 2015|accessdate=October 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

 |ShortSummary    = On June 13, in Odessa, Texas, Primatech, the leaders in "Evo" research, are hosting a peace summit for Evos and humans to come together, when the venue is bombed. Mohinder is blamed for the bombing, and over the next year, people with powers around the world are hunted down, believed to be dangerous and untrustworthy. Tommy Clark, a high school student with powers living in Illinois, barely escapes an anonymous meeting for Evos that turns into a slaughter. Noah is working as a car salesman under the name Ted Barnes when he finds out that his memory of the bombing was tampered with. War veteran Carlos Gutierrez finds out that his brother Oscar has been fighting crime as a masked vigilante with super strength in Los Angeles, but when Oscar dies, Carlos is faced with tough responsibilities. In Tokyo, a girl named Miko Otomo finds a sword in her father's study that sends her into a video game world to save him.

Going through Oscar's notes, Carlos stumbles upon Oscar's underground railroad for evos escaping to Canada. When Luke and Joanne find themselves teleported to Tommy's old room in Primatech's Level 5, they break out, killing everyone still at the company and taking the files with every Evo's known location.

''Heroes Reborn'' received mixed-to-negative reviews from television critics, with a critic score of 53 out of 100 on [[Metacritic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/tv/heroes-reborn|title=Heroes: Reborn|website=Metacritic|access-date=2016-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[Rotten Tomatoes]] it received a 43% fresh rating, where it was criticized for overuse of special effects and melodrama.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/heroes-reborn/s01/|title=Heroes Reborn: Season 1|website=www.rottentomatoes.com|access-date=2016-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

About the show's reception, Kring said: "Well, when you make a show like that, I was adamant about that show being a thirteen-episode event series, and having a closed-ended quality to it. I had always felt that one of the issues with ''Heroes'' was the ongoing nature of it was difficult to sustain, so I really loved the idea that this was a thirteen-episode event series, and when it was over, it was over. I don’t know that the audience ever really understood that that was the initial plan from the very beginning. So I think that it got a little confusing for the audience as to whether it was a reboot of ''Heroes'', or whether it was just an event series. As much as we tried to say it every time in the press, I think that message may not have completely come through, that it was always intended to come to an end. So in terms of how it wrapped up, I feel a little remorse that I think a lot of people didn’t understand that it was supposed to wrap up when it did. We actually really felt very good about what we accomplished with the thirteen episodes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.assignmentx.com/2017/beyond-tim-kring-talks-about-new-series-and-the-end-of-heroes-reborn-exclusive-interview/|title=BEYOND: Tim Kring talks about new series and the end of HEROES REBORN - Exclusive Interview|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Hostel Dormitory.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Hostel dormitory room in [[Taiwan]].]]
[[Image:Altena-Burg1-Asio.JPG|right|thumb|250px|The world's first "youth hostel" was established in 1912 at [[Altena Castle]] in Germany.]]

'''Hostels''' provide budget, sociable [[lodging|accommodation]] where guests can rent a [[bed (furniture)|bed]], usually a [[bunk bed]], in a [[dormitory]] and share a bathroom, lounge and sometimes a kitchen. Rooms can be mixed or single-sex, and private rooms may also be available.

Hostels are often cheaper for both the operator and occupants; many hostels have long-term residents who they employ as desk agents or housekeeping staff in exchange for experience or discounted accommodation.

In [[India]], [[Pakistan]] and [[South Africa]], ''hostel'' also refers to [[boarding school]]s or student [[dormitory|dormitories]] in resident colleges and universities. In other parts of the world, the word hostel mainly refers to properties offering shared accommodation to [[travel]]lers or [[Backpacking (travel)|backpackers]].

==History==
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2018}}
[[File:Affiche-guerre Femmes-au-travail.jpg|thumbnail|This poster, dating from 1915, promotes supporting the Women's War Time Fund, which provided hostel housing to women workers during the First World War]]

In 1912, in [[Altena]] [[Castle]] in [[Germany]], [[Richard Schirrmann]] created the first permanent ''Jugendherberge'' or "Youth Hostel."{{fact|date=June 2015}} These first youth hostels were an exponent of the vision of the [[German Youth Movement]] to let poor city youngsters breathe fresh air outdoors. The youths were supposed to manage the hostel themselves as much as possible, doing chores to keep the costs down and build character, and be physically active outdoors. Because of this, many youth hostels closed during the middle part of the day.

==Differences from hotels==
{{unreferenced section|date=May 2013}}
[[Image:Hostel in Japan.jpg|right|thumb|Youth hostel in [[Japan]]]]

There are several [https://hostelgeeks.com/what-is-a-hostel-defintions/ differences between hostels and hotels], including:

# Hostels tend to be budget-oriented; rates are considerably lower, and many hostels have programs to share books, DVDs and other items.
# For those who prefer an informal environment, hostels do not usually have the same level of formality as hotels.
# For those who prefer to socialize with their fellow guests, hostels usually have more common areas and opportunities to socialize. The dormitory aspect of hostels also increases the social factor.
# Hostels are generally self-catering.
# Hostels normally close during the day to keep down cost (for the customer and the hostel).

===Communal accommodation===
[[Image:Hostel Lockers.jpg|thumb|High-tech hostel lockers with [[electronic key]] locks.]]

There is less privacy in a hostel than in a hotel. Sharing sleeping accommodation in a [[dormitory]] is very different from staying in a private room in a hotel or [[bed and breakfast]], and might not be comfortable for those requiring more privacy. Hostels encourage more social interaction between guests due to the shared sleeping areas and communal areas such as lounges, kitchens and internet cafes.

Care should be taken with personal belongings, as guests may share a common living space, so it is advisable to secure guests' belongings. Most hostels offer some sort of system for safely storing valuables, and an increasing number of hostels offer private lockers; there are other things to consider as well when choosing a safe hostel, such as whether they have a guest curfew, uphold fire codes, 24-hour security, and [[CCTV]].

Noise can make sleeping difficult on occasions, whether from [[snoring]], talking, [[Human sexual activity|sexual activity]], someone either returning late or leaving early, or the proximity of so many people. To mitigate this, some wear earplugs and/or sleeping masks.

=== Self-contained facilities and services ===
In attempts to attract more visitors, many hostels nowadays provide additional services not previously available, such as airport shuttle transfers, internet cafés, swimming pools and spas, tour booking and carfree hire. Some hostels may include a hot meal in the price.

==Types==
[[Image:Aboriginal Hostel Budapest.jpg|thumb|200px|Dormitory from a hostel in [[Budapest]], [[Hungary]]]]
[[File:060715 Passat.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The ship ''[[Passat (ship)|Passat]]'' is a floating hostel and museum]]

The traditional hostel format involved dormitory style accommodation. Some newer hostels also include en-suite accommodation with single, double or quad occupancy rooms, though to be considered a hostel they must also provide dormitory accommodation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://hostelgeeks.com/what-is-a-hostel-defintions/|title=Definition of Hostel - Hostel Geeks|website=Hostelgeeks|accessdate=24 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first= | last= | coauthors= | title=5 Star Hostels | date= | publisher=Hostelgeeks.com | url =https://hostelgeeks.com/what-is-a-hostel-defintions/ | work= | pages=12 | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years, the numbers of independent and backpackers' hostels have increased greatly to cater for the greater numbers of overland, multi-destination travellers (such as [[Gap year|gap-year]] travellers and rail-trippers).

The quality of such places has also improved dramatically. While most hostels still insist on a [[curfew]], daytime lockouts, very few require occupants to do chores apart from washing and drying up after food preparation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Ginny | last=McGrath | coauthors= | title=Whatever happened to Youth Hostels? | date=2008-04-29 | publisher=Times Online | url =http://travel.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/travel/news/article3840062.ece | work= | pages= | accessdate = | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hostelling International (HI) ===
Richard Schirrmann's idea of hostels rapidly spread overseas and eventually resulted in [[Hostelling International]], an organisation composed of more than 90 different youth hostel associations representing over 4,500 youth hostels in over 80 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hihostels.com/web/about.en.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-06-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120503200659/http://www.hihostels.com/web/about.en.htm |archivedate=2012-05-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some HI Youth Hostels cater more to school-aged children (sometimes through school trips) and parents with their children, whereas others are more for travellers intent on learning new cultures. However, while the exploration of different cultures and places is emphasised in many hostels, particularly in cities or popular tourist destinations, there are still many hostels providing accommodation for outdoor pursuits such as [[hillwalking]], [[climbing]] and [[bicycle touring]]; these are often small friendly hostels retaining much of the original vision and often provide valuable access to more remote regions.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

In the past several years, Hostelling International have increasingly added hotels and package resorts to their networks in addition to hostels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hostelmanagement.com/forums/hostelling-international-selling-hotel-rooms.html|title=Hostelling International Selling Hotel Rooms - Hostel Management Discussion|website=Hostel Management|accessdate=24 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite their name, in most countries membership is not limited to youth.

===Independent hostels===
Independent hostels are not necessarily affiliated with one of the national bodies of Hostelling International, Youth Hostel Association or any other hostel network. Often, the word ''independent'' is used to refer to non-HI hostels even when the hostels do belong to another hostelling organization such as SIH&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hostel-scotland.co.uk/|title=Hostelling in Scotland - Scottish Independent Hostels|website=www.hostel-scotland.co.uk|accessdate=24 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Backpackers Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.backpackers.ca/|title=Backpackers Hostels Canada: Canada's Best Youth Hostels|first=|last=HamiltonSeen|website=www.backpackers.ca|accessdate=24 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "youth" is less often used with these properties. Unlike a hotel chain where everything is standardised, these hostels can be very diverse, typically not requiring a membership card. There are chains of independent hostels throughout the world such as the Jazz Hostels on the East Coast and Banana Bungalow Hostels on the West Coast of the United States, or the Generator Hostels and Equity Point Hostels of Europe, or [[Zostel]] of India. Each offers their own niche of services to travellers and backpackers. For example, one independent hostel might feature a lot of in house gatherings, another might feature daily and nightly tours or events in the surrounding city, and another might have a quieter place to relax in serenity, or be located on the beach. This is an independent hostel's personality and travellers will frequent the hostels that offer the personality that they find desirable. There is frequently a distinction being a "party hostel" or not.

===Boutique hostels===
The general backpacking community is no longer exclusively typified by student travellers and extreme shoe string budgets.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.scribd.com/doc/21123996/Backpacker-Tourism ''The Global Nomad''] Greg Richards, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; In response to demand, as well as increasing competition between the rapidly growing number of hostels, the overall quality of hostels has improved across the industry. In addition to the increase in quality among all styles of hostel, new styles of hostels have developed that have a focus on a more trendy, design interior. As research shows there is also a growing segment of older remote working travelers preferring hostels or backpacker lodging that offer slightly more upmarket private rooms or generally quieter accommodation such as Blouberg Backpackers in Cape Town. Thus there is a changing trend towards hostels offering this type of service inclusive of en-suite bathrooms and more in some instances along with improved quality of service. Thus the term 'Boutique Hostel' is increasing to attract this sort of guest.

The phrase "boutique hostel"  an often-arbitrary marketing term typically used to describe intimate, luxurious or quirky hostel environments. The term has started to lose meaning because the facilities of many "boutique hostels" are often no different from hostels that are not referred to with that label. Also, marketers and online booking websites sometimes include [[boutique hotels]] in lists of "boutique hostels," further diluting any specific meaning of the phrase.

A related term, "flashpackers", often refers to hostels that target themselves as catering to a slightly older, tech-savvy clientele, but in practice, many of the new class of higher-quality hostels across the industry offer these tech-oriented facilities, and even the flashpacker websites that appeared in 2006–08 during the peak of the "flashpacker" hype are neglected or offline as of 2012 as the term has rapidly lost popularity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/world/flashpackers-do-it-in-style/2006/02/18/1140151848856.html?page=fullpage|title=Flashpackers do it in style - World - Travel - smh.com.au|website=www.smh.com.au|accessdate=24 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mobile hostels===
Though very uncommon, a mobile hostel is a hostel with no fixed location. It can exist in the form of a campsite, a temporary building, bus, van, or a short term agreement in a permanent building. Mobile hostels have sprouted up at large [[festival]]s where there exists a shortage of budget accommodation. As with regular hostels, mobile hostels generally provide dormitory accommodation for [[Backpacking (travel)|backpackers]] or travelers on a shoe string budget. The first ever (and only) commercial example of a mobile hostel is Hostival. It has sprouted up at [[Oktoberfest]], [[Carnival]], [[San Fermin]], [[Las Fallas]] and the 2010 [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]].

==Industry growth==

[[Image:Kitchen The Secret Garden Kraków hostel 2016.jpg|thumb|250px|Kitchen in a hostel in [[Kraków]].]]
The independent hostel industry is growing rapidly in many cities around the world, such as New York, Rome, Buenos Aires and Miami.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Suzette | last=Laboy | coauthors= | title=South Beach becoming backpacker hot spot | date=2009-07-27 | publisher=Associated Press | url =http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/travel/2004419334_websouthbeach16.html | work= | pages= | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is reflected in the development and expansion of dozens of hostel chains worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hostelmanagement.com/wiki/list-of-hostel-chains-1005813.html|title=List of Hostel Chains – Hostel Wiki&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|publisher=|accessdate=24 July 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120722082120/http://www.hostelmanagement.com/wiki/list-of-hostel-chains-1005813.html|archivedate=22 July 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The recent eruption in independent hostels has been called "probably the single biggest news in the world of low-cost travel and  very safe".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.frommers.com/blog/2008/06/eruption-of-low-cost-private-hostels.html|title=Frommer's|website=www.frommers.com|accessdate=24 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The development of independent backpackers hostels is a strong business model, with some cities reporting a higher average income per room for hostels than hotels. For example, in the city of [[Honolulu]], [[Hawaii]], upscale hotels are reportedly making $141 to $173 per room, while hostel rooms in the same city can bring in as much as $200 per night, due to several paying guests residing in one room.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://starbulletin.com/2006/07/09/business/story01.html|title=starbulletin.com - Business - /2006/07/09/|first=Honolulu|last=Star-Bulletin|website=starbulletin.com|accessdate=24 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Even during the [[2008 economic crisis]], many hostels are reporting increased occupancy numbers in a time when hotel bookings are down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2008/TRAVEL/getaways/12/02/hostels/index.html?iref=24hours|title=Winter 'flashpackers' prepare to invade hostels - CNN.com|first=By  Debra Alban|last=CNN|website=www.cnn.com|accessdate=24 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|Even as the city’s hotel occupancy rate has fallen to 66 percent in February, from 81 percent in the same month last year, despite steep discounts, many youth hostels are reporting banner business.|''[[New York Times]]''&lt;ref&gt;Allen Salkin, [https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/15/nyregion/15hostel.html In Hostel Basement, Newcomer Sets Sights Far Up the Ladder]," ''[[New York Times]]'', March 14, 2009. Accessed March 16, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Though in the past, hostels have been seen as low-quality accommodation for less wealthy travellers, at least one Australian study has shown that backpackers (who typically stay at hostels) spend more than non-backpackers, due to their longer stays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tra.australia.com/content/documents/Snapshots/2008/BackPacker_07_FINAL.pdf|title=Australia.com|publisher=|accessdate=24 July 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080912163034/http://www.tra.australia.com/content/documents/Snapshots/2008/BackPacker_07_FINAL.pdf|archivedate=12 September 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Backpacking (travel)|Backpackers]] in Australia contribute nearly $3.4 billion and stay on average 34.2 nights compared to the 31 nights spent by other travellers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.destinationnsw.com.au/tourism/facts-and-figures/market-segments|title=Tourism Market Segments - Destination NSW|website=www.destinationnsw.com.au|accessdate=24 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In New Zealand, backpackers hostels had a 13.5% share of accommodation guest/nights in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tourismresearch.govt.nz/Documents/Tourism%20Sector%20Profiles/TotalAccommodationSectorMay07.pdf Tourismresearch.govt.nz]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tourismresearch.govt.nz/Data--Analysis/Tourism-Sector-Profiles/Accommodation/|title=Homepage - Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment|website=www.tourismresearch.govt.nz|accessdate=24 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Youth Travel Accommodation Industry Survey ===
Annually the Association of Youth Travel Accommodation undertakes a review of the business operations of the hostel sector, to establish crucial business metrics and identify trends in this dynamic sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.staywyse.org/annual-survey/ |title=Youth Travel Accommodation Annual Survey |accessdate=2016-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study is undertaken in partnership with [[Hostelling International]] and Web Reservations International.

The findings of the 2010 study included:
* Average occupancy rates were around 56%
* Occupancy levels were highest in Oceania and Asia
* The sale of beds accounted for 70% of reported revenue. F&amp;B sales accounted for 14% of total revenue
* The average dorm bed rate varied between EUR 21 in the high season and EUR 15 in the low season
* The main cost items for hostel establishments are staff and premises, which together accounted for 45% of total expenses
* Marketing costs accounted for almost 10% of the total budget
* Only 8% of hostel operators currently participate in green certification schemes

According to the Youth Travel Accommodation's Annual Survey one of the main reasons for a relatively strong performance of the hostel sector is the tendency for operators to innovate and adapt their products to suit market conditions. The fact that hostel operators could generally sustain business levels through the downturn was one of the main reasons why overall average bed rates for 2009 rose by more than 3% compared with 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.staywyse.org/portal/page/portal/MenuSecSiteSTAYWYSE/MenuSubpageAnnual%20Industry%20Survey|title=STAY WYSE|publisher=|accessdate=24 July 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728055706/http://www.staywyse.org/portal/page/portal/MenuSecSiteSTAYWYSE/MenuSubpageAnnual%20Industry%20Survey|archivedate=28 July 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
[[Motion picture]]s have generally portrayed hostels in two ways: as fun places for young people to stay (for example, ''[[The Journey of Jared Price]]'' and ''[[A Map for Saturday]]''), or alternatively, as dangerous places where unsuspecting [[United States|Americans]] face potential horrors in [[Eastern Europe]] (see, e.g., ''[[Hostel (2005 film)|Hostel]]'', ''[[Hostel: Part II]]'', and ''[[EuroTrip]]''). There are some [[Urban legend|popular misconceptions]] that a hostel is a kind of a [[flophouse]], [[homeless shelter]] or [[halfway house]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6801">The history of '''humor on the Internet''' begins together with the [[Internet]] itself. Initially internet and its precursors, [[LAN]]s and [[Wide Area Network|WAN]]s, were used merely as another media to disseminate [[joke]]s and other kinds of [[humor]], in addition to the traditional ones ("[[word of mouth]]", [[printed media]], sound recording, radio, film, and TV).&lt;ref name=lshi&gt;Limor Shifman, [http://ijoc.org/index.php/ijoc/article/view/11 "Humor in the Age of Digital Reproduction: Continuity and Change in Internet-Based Comic Texts"],  ''International Journal of Communication'', vol. 1, 2007, ''Quote'': " A content analysis of 400 humorous texts from eight salient humorous websites shows that the Internet functions both as a ‘carrier’ of old humor types such as jokes and cartoons and as a ‘generator’ of new humor types."&lt;/ref&gt; In lockstep with the progress of [[electronic communication]] technologies, jokers took advantage of the [[ARPANET]],&lt;ref name=taoup&gt;Eric S. Raymond, ''The Art of UNIX Programming'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=H4q1t-jAcBIC&amp;pg=PA44 p. 44]. ''Quote'': "Software, ideas, slang, and a good deal of humor flowed over the experimental ARPANET links. Something like a shared culture began to form"&lt;/ref&gt; [[e-mail]],&lt;ref&gt;Trevor J. Blank, [http://digitalcommons.usu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1034&amp;context=usupress_pubs ''Folklore and the Internet: Vernacular Expression in a Digital World''], 2009, . Logan, Utah: Utah State University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Usenet]] [[newsgroup]]s (e.g., [[rec.humor]] and [[alt.humor]]),  [[bulletin board system]]s,..., and finally the Whole [[World Wide Web]]. Gradually, [[#New types of humor|new forms of humor]] evolved, based on the new possibilities delivered by electronic means of communication.&lt;ref name=lshi/&gt; A popular form of internet humour is found in the form of '[[internet meme]]s'. 'Memes' are almost akin to an inside joke among the internet, once a meme is overused to the point where no humour is gained from it, it is considered 'dead' or 'stale'.

==Impact on humor==
Internet made an impact on humor in several important ways.

Similarly to other technical innovations (from printing to TV), Internet significantly increased the speed and the extent of the propagation of humor over the world.&lt;ref name=gkui&gt;Giselinde Kuipers, "Good Humor, Bad Taste: A Sociology of the Joke", {{ISBN|1501510894}}, 2015, [https://books.google.com/books?id=LYwoCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT41 pp.41, 42]&lt;/ref&gt; The joke is a commonly transmitted type of [[internet meme]]. It is well-known that orally-transmitted jokes and other kind of [[folklore]] undergo evolution and mutations. Internet speeds up and globalizes these processes.&lt;ref&gt;Limor Shifman, Mike Thelwall, "Assessing Global Diffusion with Web Memetics: The Spread and Evolution of a Popular Joke", ''Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology'' Vol. 60, Issue 12, pp. 2567–2576 {{doi|10.1002/asi.21185}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[FAQ]] of [[rec.humor]] gave the following tongue-in-cheek description how jokes propagated in the era of newsgroups:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.laughnet.net/rechumor.htm Rec.humor FAQ] (retrieved March 6, 2017)&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
#Somebody makes up the joke.
#The joke spreads to about 50 people.
#Somebody posts it to rec.humor.
#Ten thousand people read the joke on rec.humor.
#Eight hundred of these people repeat the joke to somebody.
#Twenty of _those_ people are clueless enough to repost the joke to rec.humor, apparently lacking either the reading skills to have seen it the first time, the basic pattern-recognition capability to identify it in its last ten repetitions, or the short-term memory to realize that it's the same joke again.
#Loop back to step 4, about ten times.
#Repeat from step 3 about every two months.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On the opposite side, unlike previous technical means, internet as a whole eliminates [[censorship]] and [[self-censorship]] of humor. For example, before the Internet [[Black comedy|extremely sick jokes]], such as [[dead baby jokes]], were almost exclusively spread orally.&lt;ref name=gkui/&gt;

Internet blurred the lines between written and spoken in terms of language use and the directness of speech, between what is permitted in private and in public. Also, [[YouTube]] blurred the distinction between a spoken and recorded joke, in that the narrator is actually present.&lt;ref name=gkui/&gt;

Limor and Lemish observe that internet humor is a part of the [[participatory culture]], where the "consumers" of jokes may reciprocate by generating and transmitting humor, i.e., act as "producers" and "distributors".&lt;ref&gt;Limor Shifman, Dafna Lemish, "“Mars and Venus” in Virtual Space: Post-feminist Humor and the Internet", ''Critical Studies in Media Communication'', 28(3), 253-273. ([https://www.academia.edu/1130534/_Mars_and_Venus_in_Virtual_Space_Post-feminist_Humor_and_the_Internet preprint version])&lt;/ref&gt;

==New types of humor==
New possibilities provided by electronic means of communication gave rise to new types of humor. An early example of these is humorous [[ASCII art]]. While the precursor of the ASCII art, the "typewrite art", has been known since 19th century, &lt;!-- primary site http://www.geocities.com/SoHo/7373/history.htm#typewrite --&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last=Stark| first=Joan G.| authorlink=Joan Stark| title=The History of ASCII (Text) Art| year=2001| accessdate=5 March 2008|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5klVZl8en?url=http://www.geocities.com/SoHo/7373/history.htm|archivedate=24 October 2009|deadurl=yes|url=http://www.geocities.com/SoHo/7373/history.htm}}
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.typewritermuseum.org/lib/library_art2.html|title=Typewriter Art|last=Robert|first=Paul|date=11 May 2005|publisher=The Virtual Typewriter Museum|accessdate=5 March 2008}}
&lt;/ref&gt;  it was available to few. Whereas ASCII art, including silly one, has become ubiquitous in [[sig block]]s in discussion boards and e-mails. One may find quite a few silly examples  in the ''[[Jargon File]]'', which also mentions subgenres of ASCII art humor: puns on the letter/character names (e.g., if read "B" as "[[bee]]" and the [[caret]] character (^) as "[[carrot]]", the one may create an ASCII art [[rebus]] for a "bee in a carrot patch") and pictures of "silly cows" .&lt;ref&gt;[[Eric S. Raymond]], ''The New Hacker's Dictionary'', {{ISBN|0262680920}}, 1996, [https://books.google.com/books?id=g80P_4v4QbIC&amp;pg=PA48, pp. 48, 49]&lt;/ref&gt;

The ability to easily manipulate with images and videos combined with ease of the dissemination of them via the Internet introduced new forms of graphical humor, such as [[lolcat]]s,  [[demotivator]]s, and funny animations.

'''Ida Herion''' (1876–1959) was a female German dance teacher, who from 1912 ran a dance school in [[Stuttgart]].

In the 1920s Herion's students were the subject of two books of photographs, ''Getanzte Harmonien'' by Paul Isenfels (1926) and ''Tanzkunst und Kunsttanz'' by Max Adolphi and Arno Kettman (1927).

Herion's dance school has been regarded as providing a distinctively [[modernist]] view of [[nudity]] and the [[human body|body]]:
{{quote|Herion linked nudism and ecstatic dance not to the recovery of an atavistic, primordial state of freedom but to the achievement of an aristocratic freedom or remoteness from any familiar place, be it wilderness, the bourgeois studio, or the conventional theatre stage. Ecstasy resulted from the elegantly poised beauty of the dancing body, its ability to create its own beautiful world.&lt;ref name="Toepfer1997"&gt;{{cite book|author=Karl Eric Toepfer|title=Empire of Ecstasy: Nudity and Movement in German Body Culture, 1910-1935|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FgvYUZh75WwC&amp;pg=PA67|year=1997|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-91827-6|pages=67–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

'''''Independence Day: Resurgence''''' (also known as '''''ID: R''''') is a 2016 American [[science fiction film|science fiction]] [[action film|action]] [[disaster film]] written and directed by [[Roland Emmerich]] with co-writers [[Dean Devlin]], Nicolas Wright, James A. Woods, and [[James Vanderbilt]]. A sequel to the 1996 film ''[[Independence Day (1996 film)|Independence Day]]'', it stars an [[ensemble cast]] featuring [[Liam Hemsworth]], [[Jeff Goldblum]], [[Bill Pullman]], [[Maika Monroe]], [[Jessie Usher]], [[Travis Tope]], [[William Fichtner]], [[Charlotte Gainsbourg]], [[Judd Hirsch]], [[Brent Spiner]], and [[Sela Ward]].

The film takes place twenty years after the events of the first film, during which the [[United Nations]] has collaborated to form Earth Space Defense (ESD), an international military defense and research organization. Through [[reverse engineering]], the world has harnessed the power of alien technology and laid the groundwork to resist a second invasion.

Plans for a sequel to ''Independence Day'' began as early as 2001, with [[20th Century Fox]] eventually [[green-light]]ing the project in 2014. Principal photography began in April 2015 at locations primarily in [[New Mexico]] but also in the [[Bonneville Salt Flats]] of [[Utah]], which were featured in the original. ''Independence Day: Resurgence'' was released in the United States on June 24, 2016, twenty years after the release of ''Independence Day'', in 2D, 3D, and [[IMAX 3D]], grossing $389.7 million worldwide at the box office. The film received mixed reviews from critics, who found the plot convoluted and action sequences overblown, though some praised its overall humor and the visual effects.

Twenty years after [[Independence Day (1996 film)|the devastating alien invasion]], the [[United Nations]] has set up the Earth Space Defense (ESD), a global defense and research program that [[Reverse engineering|reverse-engineers]] alien technology and serves as Earth's [[early warning system]] against extraterrestrial threats.&lt;ref name="warof1996.com"&gt;{{cite web|title=The War of 1996|url=http://www.warof1996.com|publisher=20th Century Fox|accessdate=June 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Chitwood|first=Adam|title=Independence Day 2 Synopsis Revealed|url=http://collider.com/independence-day-2-synopsis-revealed/|website=[[Collider (website)|Collider]]|date=June 6, 2015|accessdate=June 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Independence Day: Crucible"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Keyes|first1=Greg|title=Independence Day: Crucible|date=May 24, 2016|publisher=Titan Books|isbn=1785651307|pages=320|edition=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Civilization has been restored and relative [[World peace|peace among nations]] exists following the human race's victory over the aliens' attacks.

As the twentieth anniversary of the invasion approaches, ESD Director David Levinson meets with warlord Dikembe Umbutu and Dr. Catherine Marceaux in the African state Republique Nationale d'Umbutu.&lt;ref name="Space"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.space.com/33364-spaceships-independence-day-resurgence.html|title=The Epic Spaceships of 'Independence Day: Resurgence'|date=July 7, 2016|author=Elizabeth Howell|work=''[[Space.com]]''|accessdate=July 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; They travel to an intact alien city destroyer and discover that alien survivors sent a distress call to their home world before their defeat. It is revealed that former U.S. President Thomas Whitmore, Dr. Brackish Okun, and Umbutu are [[Telepathy|telepathically]] linked to the aliens, following personal encounters, and have visions of an unidentified spherical object.

An unidentified spherical ship emerges from a wormhole near Earth's [[Moon]], and despite objections from Levinson, is destroyed on the orders of the [[United Nations Security Council]]. Defying orders, American pilots Jake Morrison and Charlie Miller then pick up Levinson, Marceaux, Umbutu, and U.S. federal controller Floyd Rosenberg on a [[space tug]]. They head for the wreckage in the [[Van de Graaff (crater)|Van de Graaff]] crater, where they recover a large container. An alien mothership suddenly appears,&lt;ref name="Space" /&gt; responding to the distress call, and proceeds to destroy much of the Earth's planetary defenses before landing over the [[North Atlantic Ocean]], where it starts to drill down toward the Earth's molten core. Narrowly escaping death, those on board the space tug are able to avoid capture and return to [[Area 51]].

Whitmore, Levinson, and U.S. General Joshua Adams' groups interrogate one of the aliens held in captivity at Area 51's prison facility from the war. They learn that the aliens exist in [[eusociality|a hivemind]] and that one of their colossal Queens is commanding the invasion. Levinson hypothesizes that if they kill the supervising Queen, her forces will cease drilling and go dormant. An ESD aerial fleet, led by Captain Dylan Hiller, stages a counterattack, but they are caught in a trap within the mothership, leaving only a few survivors, including Dylan, Jake, Charlie, and fellow ESD lieutenant and Chinese pilot Rain Lao.

In Area 51, Okun opens the rescued container and releases a giant white sphere of [[virtual intelligence]]. The sphere reveals that her mission is to evacuate survivors to a planet of refuge from worlds targeted by the aliens, whom she calls "Harvesters", and unite them in an attack on the Harvesters' planet. In the mothership, all surviving ESD pilots manage to escape by hijacking enemy craft; Dylan, Jake, Charlie, and Rain navigate two Harvester fighters to pursue the Queen's personal ship, which is heading to Area 51 to extract information from the sphere about the refugee planet.

Knowing the Harvester Queen has become aware of the sphere's location, the ESD hide her in an isolation chamber and use a decoy in Jake's space tug to lure the Harvester Queen's ship into a trap. Whitmore volunteers to pilot the transport ship on a [[suicide mission]], leading the Queen's ship into a trap before detonating a bomb, thus sacrificing himself but destroying the enemy ship. However, the Harvester Queen survives by using an [[Force field (fiction)|energy shield]] and a fight breaks out. Initially, the ESD soldiers' weapons cannot penetrate the Queen's shield, but after the Harvester Queen lowers her shield to fire her own weapon, a good shot by Whitmore's daughter Patricia disables her shield. This allows Dylan's party, which arrives just in time, to ultimately kill her before she can take the sphere.

With the Queen dead, all the remaining alien fighters are rendered inactive, while the mothership stops drilling and retreats to space. Okun reveals that the sphere has asked humanity to lead her resistance and has offered them new technology in preparation for a potential [[counterattack]] on the Harvester's home world.

=== Casting ===
Early on, both Emmerich and Devlin hoped that Smith would return.&lt;ref name=sequelideasmith /&gt; However, in June 2013, Emmerich announced that Smith would not be returning, noting that "he's too expensive."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last1 = Taylor | first1 = Drew | last2 = Sacks | first2 = Ethan | title = Will Smith won't be in 'Independence Day 2,' director confirms | publisher = [[Daily News (New York)|New York Daily News]] | date = June 22, 2013 | url = http://www.nydailynews.com/smith-won-independence-day-2-director-confirms-article-1.1379824#bmb=1 | accessdate=June 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smith later stated that he declined the role due to scheduling conflicts with ''[[Suicide Squad (film)|Suicide Squad]]'', also in production at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last1 = Bruner | first1 = Raisa | title = Here's Why Will Smith Isn't in the New Independence Day Movie | publisher = [[Time (magazine)|Time]] | date = June 24, 2016 | url = http://time.com/4382234/will-smith-independence-day-2/ | accessdate=June 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smith's absence in the movie is explained with the death of his character, Steven Hiller, who had been promoted to [[Colonel (United States)|colonel]], 11 years after the events of the first film when personally testing the first experimental prototype fighter designed with alien technology for the ESD.&lt;ref name="warof1996.com" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Independence Day: Crucible" /&gt; Later in June, it was officially confirmed that both Goldblum and Pullman would return in the sequel, and that a gay character would be featured.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Chapman|first=Glen| url = http://www.denofgeek.com/movies/independence-day/26177/jeff-goldblum-and-bill-pullman-return-for-independence-day-2 | title = Jeff Goldblum and Bill Pullman return for Independence Day 2|website=Den of Geek|date=June 27, 2013|accessdate=December 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://uk.ign.com/articles/2013/06/26/independence-day-2-will-feature-a-gay-character | title = Independence Day 2 will feature a gay character | publisher = [[IGN]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; After ''Resurgence'''s release, reviewers with an interest in LGBT issues accused the film of under-delivering on this commitment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newnownext.com/dont-expect-independence-days-gay-couple-to-kiss-or-survive-the-movie/06/2016/|title=Don't expect Independence Day's gay couple to kiss &amp;mdash; or survive the movie|first=Dan|last=Avery|publisher=New Now Next|date=2016-06-24|accessdate=2016-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Filming ===
Filming began on April 20, 2015,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Joey King on Twitter|url=https://twitter.com/JoeyKingActress/status/590277106535243779|publisher=twitter.com|accessdate=April 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dean Devlin on Twitter|url=https://twitter.com/Dean_Devlin/status/591129468728664064|publisher=twitter.com|accessdate=April 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and wrapped on August 22, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://comicbook.com/2015/08/23/independence-day-resurgence-wraps-filming/|title=Independence Day Resurgence Wraps Filming|last=Jayson|first=Jay|work=Comicbook.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Filming for additional scenes also took place in early 2016 in Los Angeles. Some scenes were also filmed in West Wendover, Nevada, [[London]], at the [[Burj Khalifa]] in Dubai, and [[Singapore]]'s [[Marina Bay Sands]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenational.ae/blogs/scene-heard/burj-khalifa-makes-cameo-in-latest-independence-day-resurgence-trailer|title=Burj Khalifa and Singapore's Marina Bay Sands make cameos in latest Independence Day: Resurgence trailer|last=Raymond|first=Jonathan}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the availability of regional filming, the producers decided to shoot the film largely in [[New Mexico]]. Moreover, the state offers a 25% movie [[tax credit]]. However, while location filming did take place in rural New Mexico and further north on the [[Utah]] and [[Nevada]] border, most of the shooting was studio-based. Albuquerque Studios was a major venue for the film in which ''[[Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials]]'' and ''[[The Lone Ranger (2013 film)|The Lone Ranger]]'' were also filmed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kftv.com/news/2016/06/27/independence-day-resurgence-used-new-mexico-filming-incentive|title=Independence Day: Resurgence filmed in adapted New Mexico studios|author=Nick Goundry|work=KFTV|date=June 27, 2016|accessdate=June 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was shot on [[Red Digital Cinema Camera Company|Red Dragon]] [[Anamorphic format|anamorphic]] cameras in 6K resolution, being later [[2D to 3D conversion|stereo converted]].&lt;ref name=fx/&gt;

Emmerich decided to return to the [[Bonneville Salt Flats]] in [[Utah]], which he said he fell in love with while looking for a unique location for shooting the first film. However, problems cropped up as Emmerich was slightly disappointed by the nature and color of the area. This was because prior to the arrival of the crew, a windstorm had occurred around the area, which blew a lot of dirt into the salt and subsequently turned it into a shade of beige.&lt;ref name="SLT"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sltrib.com/news/4046076-155/brave-viewers-will-revisit-utahs-bonneville|title=Brave viewers will revisit Utah's Bonneville Salt Flats, if not Will Smith, in 'Independence Day' sequel|author=Emma Penrod|work=[[The Salt Lake Tribune]]|date=June 24, 2016|accessdate=June 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The filmmakers refrained from shooting in [[India]] or portraying any prominent Indian monuments as being damaged to avoid potential protests and legal action from Indian religious groups and activists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.mumbaimirror.com/entertainment/bollywood/No-Taj-Gateway-for-this-alien-invasion/articleshow/52827848.cms | title=No Taj, Gateway for this alien invasion | work=[[Mumbai Mirror]] | date=June 20, 2016 | accessdate=June 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally, [[Dubai]] was planned to land on [[Paris]] in the scene depicting the mothership destroying Europe while using Asian monuments pulled out by its gravitational pull. However, following the [[November 2015 Paris attacks]], filmmakers reconsidered and instead had Dubai land on [[London]]. Emmerich said, "After the attacks, we felt it wasn't right to have the [[Burj Khalifa]] crashing on the [[Eiffel Tower]], so we dumped it on the [[London Eye]] instead. The English can take it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.empireonline.com/movies/features/independence-day-resurgence-11-things-learnt-director-roland-emmerich/|title=Independence Day: Resurgence – 11 things we learnt from Roland Emmerich|author=Phil De Semlyen|work=[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]|date=July 1, 2016|accessdate=July 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Visual effects and design===
Like the original ''Independence Day'', ''Resurgence'' had its visual effects led by supervisor [[Volker Engel]] and producer [[Marc Weigert]] from [[Uncharted Territory, LLC]].&lt;ref name="INVERSE"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.inverse.com/article/17535-the-special-effects-that-helped-independence-day-resurgence-rain-death-and-asia|title=How VFX Artists Helped 'Independence Day: Resurgence' Rain Death|author=Ian Failes|work=''[[Inverse (website)|Inverse]]''|date=June 27, 2016|accessdate=June 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like with Emmerich's ''[[White House Down]]'', the Ncam [[camera tracking]] system was used on set to provide animation previews to the cast and crew and gather data for the effects companies. While the original film relied heavily on miniatures and Engel wanted them on at least one scene, the effects were mostly computer-generated "which was pretty much less than half of the budget". Uncharted Territory, along with coordinating the overall efforts of 15 effects houses, was the leading company with 268 shots, created in a tight collaboration with the film's art department. [[Scanline VFX]] was the first vendor hired,&lt;ref name=fx/&gt; and handled the mothership landing, which included creating detailed models of London and Singapore out of thousands of reference photographs and even [[Lidar]] scans to realistically destroy both cities.&lt;ref name="INVERSE"/&gt; [[Weta Digital]] was mainly responsible for the design of the aliens and carrying out the climactic battle scene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/2016/06/design-fx-independence-day-resurgence/|title=Design FX: The Wizardry Behind Independence Day's Wild Final Battle|author=Angela Watercutter|work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]|date=June 30, 2016|accessdate=July 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Titan Books]] published several tie-in books for the film, including novels and comics. The first, an omnibus of Stephen Molstad's three ''Independence Day'' novels, ''Silent Zone'', ''War in the Desert'', and the novelization of ''Independence Day'', was released on March 19, 2016.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} The second, ''Independence Day: Crucible'', was written by Greg Keyes. ''Crucible'' serves as a prequel to the film and was published on May 24, 2016. A novelization of ''Independence Day: Resurgence'' by Alex Irvine followed on June 21 before the film's release and it differs from the film in that the character of the President survives most of the alien conflict as a prisoner of the Harvester Queen and is killed when the ship is destroyed, instead of being killed when the aliens attack the fortified bunker in Colorado and it also reveals - in POV exposition, during the scene where the Queen captures the sphere - that the sphere aliens are responsible for the creation of the Harvester aliens, who turned on them and wiped them out, though this plot device is not further explored in the book and may not be considered canon in any further films since it was not used in the final film. Titan Comics started a six issue comic book miniseries, ''Independence Day: Dark Fathom'', written by [[Victor Gischler]], with art by Tazio Bettin, which serves as a prequel set between the first and second films, and which began its run on March 23 and ended on June 15.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/independence-day-resurgence-get-comic-826664|title='Independence Day: Resurgence' To Get Comic Book Prequel (Exclusive)|work=The Hollywood Reporter|last=Kit|first=Borys|date=September 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2016, 20th Century Fox's British division collaborated with [[Manchester United]], of which 20th Century Fox is the official film partner, for a commercial featuring Jeff Goldblum and Angelababy, and guest-starring United players [[Chris Smalling]], [[Daley Blind]], [[Ashley Young]], [[Juan Mata]] and captain [[Wayne Rooney]] as fighter pilots.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YyUrlxnFww ''Independence Day: Resurgence'' – Manchester United] 20th Century Fox UK on YouTube&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception ==

=== Box office ===
''Independence Day: Resurgence'' was unable to duplicate the success of its predecessor, which grossed $817.4 million worldwide in 1996. It was not even one of the top-grossing films of 2016 or of its month of release, due to ''[[Finding Dory]]'' being the highest-grossing film of June. The film also failed to garner much support from China – the world's second biggest movie market – as the cinemagoers there complained about how little screen time there was for Chinese actress [[Angelababy]]. Moreover, the film was released in a crowded summer during the "sequelitis" where numerous major sequels underperformed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/lists/summer-box-office-winners-losers-925566/item/marvel-studios-925567|title=Summer Box-Office Winners and Losers: From 'Finding Dory' to 'Ben-Hur'|author=Pamela McClintock|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=September 4, 2016|accessdate=September 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2016/film/news/independence-day-resurgence-box-office-bombs-liam-hemsworth-will-smith-1201804315/|title=3 Reasons Why 'Independence Day: Resurgence' Bombed at the U.S. Box Office|author=Ramin Setoodeh|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=June 27, 2016|accessdate=September 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/scottmendelson/2016/06/27/box-office-6-reasons-independence-day-resurgence-flopped-in-america/#3357cf215b0f|title=Box Office: 6 Reasons 'Independence Day: Resurgence' Flopped (In America)|author=Scott Mendelson|work=[[Forbes]]|date=June 27, 2016|accessdate=September 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deadline.com/2016/09/why-movie-summer-sucked-1201813876/|title=Bart &amp; Fleming: Why Summer Movie Season Sucked|author=Mike Fleming Jr|work=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|date=September 7, 2016|accessdate=September 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film has grossed $103.1 million in the United States and Canada and $286.5 million in other territories for a worldwide total of $389.7 million (53% less than the first film), against a production budget of $165 million.&lt;ref name=BOM/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/summer-box-office-2016-hits-448-billion-revenue-cant-beat-2015-925594|title=Summer Box-Office Revenue Hits $4.48B Against the Odds: "It's Tough Out There"|author=Pamela McClintock|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=September 6, 2016|accessdate=September 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Critical response ===
On [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film has an approval rating of 30% based on 204 reviews and an average rating of 4.3/10. The site's critical consensus reads, "It's undeniably visually impressive, but like its predecessor, ''Independence Day: Resurgence'' lacks enough emotional heft to support its end-of-the-world narrative stakes."&lt;ref name="RT"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/independence_day_resurgence/ |title=Independence Day: Resurgence (2016) |website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |publisher=[[Fandango Media|Fandango]]|accessdate=April 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[Metacritic]], the film has a score of 32 out of 100 based on 40 critics, indicating "generally unfavorable reviews".&lt;ref name="Meta"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/independence-day-resurgence |title=Independence Day: Resurgence Reviews |website=[[Metacritic]]|publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |accessdate=July 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Audiences polled by [[CinemaScore]] gave the film an average grade of "B" on an A+ to F scale.&lt;ref name="Independence Day"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.15august2017speech.in/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170205065228/http://www.15august2017speech.in/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2017-02-05 |title=Independence Day Speech}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Richard Roeper]] gave the film one and a half out of four stars, writing, "The ''Resurgence'' blueprint calls for a scene in which characters have human, allegedly humorous and/or touching moments; a scene in which characters plot strategy against the aliens; and a big action sequence in which it's often difficult to tell the difference between the good-guy spaceships and the bad-guy spaceships.

Dan Jolin of ''[[Empire (film magazine)|Empire]]'' gave the film a positive review, saying it was "spectacular as you'd hope from a sequel to the 1996 planet-toaster, and as amusingly cheesy.

== Future ==
In June 2016, during an interview with ''[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]'' magazine, Emmerich stated that a third film could be made, depending on the success of the second one. He also said that audiences would not have to wait as long as they did for the second in the series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/independence-day-director-shares-plot-902399 |title= 'Independence Day' Director Shares Plot of the Movie's Original, Unmade, Sequel |last= McMillan |first= Graeme |work= [[The Hollywood Reporter]] |date=June 13, 2016 |accessdate= June 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Emmerich, the third film will depict an intergalactic journey, possibly set a year or two later since he wants to maintain the same group of people, especially the young characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.empireonline.com/movies/news/independence-day-3-will-intergalactic-journey-says-roland-emmerich/ |title= Independence Day 3 will be 'an intergalactic journey' says Roland Emmerich |last=Semlyen |first= Phil De |work= [[Empire (magazine)|Empire]] |date= June 22, 2016 |accessdate= June 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In March 2018, LRM Online reported that, after having met producer Dean Devlin at WonderCon and asking about the status of ''Independence Day 3'', Devlin told them "I don't know. I don't know. Currently, I personally have no plans of doing another one."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lrmonline.com/news/exclusive-independence-day-resurgence-producer-has-no-plans-to-do-another-film-anytime-soon/|title=EXCLUSIVE: Independence Day: Resurgence Producer Has No Plans To Do Another Film Anytime Soon|first=Joseph Jammer|last=Medina|website=lrmonline.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following this, Ryan Scott at Movie Web translated the poor reception of the second film and Devlin comments as meaning ''Independence Day 3'' will likely not happen, also noting that 21st Century Fox merging with The Walt Disney Company (meaning Disney will be in control of Fox's franchises) would make it even less likely that a third film would be pursued and that we may not see another reboot of the brand for another 15-20 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://movieweb.com/independence-day-3-no-plans-producer-dean-devlin/|title=Independence Day 3 Is Completely Dead for Now|work=MovieWeb|date=March 27, 2018|accessdate=July 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Inez Fabbri''' (26 January 1831 – 30 August 1909), ''née'' Agnes Schmidt, was an [[Austrian American]] [[soprano]], voice teacher and [[impresaria]]. She sang in Austria, Germany, England, South America and the Caribbean, making her home in San Francisco where, in the 1870s, she was the most important musical personality and ''[[prima donna|prima donna assoluta]]'' of her time, performing in more than 150 concerts and operas from 1872 to 1879, producing operas, and teaching voice to up-and-coming singers.&lt;ref name=emerson&gt;{{Cite book|first=J.|last=Emerson|year=1997|chapter=Madame Inez Fabbri, Prima Donna Assoluta, and the Performance of Opera in San Francisco during the 1870s|pages=325–354|title=Music in Performance and Society|editor1-first=M.|editor1-last=Cole|editor2-first=J.|editor2-last=Koegel|publisher=Harmonie Park Press|location=Warren, MI|isbn=0-89990-106-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early career==
She was the daughter of an impoverished Viennese textile manufacturer. She made a successful operatic debut in Kassa, Hungary, (now [[Košice]], Slovakia) as Abigail in Donizetti's ''[[Lucrezia Borgia (opera)|Lucrezia Borgia]]'' in 1847. After a few years on the road singing in [[Königsberg]] (1856–1857) and [[Potsdam]] (1857), she arrived at the [[Hamburg State Opera|Hamburgischerer Stadttheater]] where, among other roles, she received recognition for Valentine in Meyerbeer's ''[[Les Huguenots]]'' which became one of her starring roles.&lt;ref name=ost&gt;''Österreichisches Biographisches Lexikon'' (1815–1950)&lt;/ref&gt;

Here she met Richard Mulder (1822–1874), a Dutch musician and impresario whom she married in 1858.&lt;ref name=emerson/&gt; He organized a tour to South America (1858–59) during which time she sang in Argentina, Brazil and Chile.&lt;ref&gt;''New York Times'' (28 June 1858) "CHILI"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=Note&gt;"A fine opera company for the splendid new house at Santiago had arrived in Valparaiso in a French clipper. It possesses three prima donnas, Mesdames Fabbri, Wideman and Leoni Bardoni. Among the male singers are the tenor Benedetti, the bass, Domenech, and the baritone, Francolini. The company is headed by Mr. Mulder, and will open in ''[[Nabucodonosor]]''", ''NYT'' (28 June 1858)&lt;/ref&gt; From then on she would use her stage name, "Fabbri"  (Italian for "Schmidt/Smith").&lt;ref name=ost/&gt;

==American career==
[[File:Inez Fabbri portrait.jpg|thumb|Inez Fabbri]] 
In 1860, she was engaged by [[Max Maretzek]] to sing at his [[Winter Garden Theatre (1850)|Winter Garden Theatre in New York]].&lt;ref group=Note&gt;"Mr.MAX MARETZEK is expected to return to the City during the coming week; his season in Havana having terminated on the 26th of last month. The greatest anxiety prevails in musical circles concerning the new prima donna, Madame INEZ FABBRI, who is known to be great not only as a singer but as a lyric actress. Her admirers maintain that she is a new Jenny Lind, and the publics of Brazil, Peru and other South American States, even go further than that. In Rio Janteiro she was, preferred to LA GRANGE and LA GRUA, -- about whom there can be no mistake. On the 9th of April Mr. MARETZEK will commence operations, and then we shall both see and hear for ourselves. In the meantime we may satisfy public curiosity by stating that there is not the slightest doubt about Madame FABBRI being entitled to the place of honor among all the prime donne now in this country." ''NYT'' (5  March 1860)&lt;/ref&gt; Her highly acclaimed American debut was as Violetta in Verdi's ''[[La Traviata]]''.&lt;ref group=Note&gt;"Madame FABBRI is the best Violetta we have had in this City. We say this without the slightest idea of underrating the excellencies of her predecessors. LA GRANGE was finished but cold; GAZZANIGA passionate but inartistic, and soon. Each singer illuminated a page of the story by some special flash of genius. Madame FABBRI lightens up the whole. In the first act she sings with the "joyaunce of rude strength; "in the second with,  the broken accents of a sudden and stupifying calamity; in the third with the protesting vehemence of one wronged; in the fourth with the sunken tones of wretched because  retrospective despair. Her perception of the emotional phases of the part are so varied and distinct, that a person seeing her in the first act, where she is all hilarity and voice, can form no idea of what she is in the last, where by consummate management she presents the spectra! and vocal wreck of  her former self. The mezzo-voce by which this is effected is the best that we have heard in a singer of such prodigious power, and the acting with which it is accompanied, has not been surpassed in propriety, if it has even been exceeded in intensity." ''NYT'' (13 April 1860)&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly thereafter, she sang Elvira in Ernani in which ''The New York Times'' wrote  that "she was more dramatic and powerful" [than in her role as Violetta] and "a dramatic actress of the first class". "Mme. Fabbri was called out twice after each act, and the finale to the third act was encored."&lt;ref name=nyt1860&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F10910FF385B157493C5A8178FD85F448684F9|newspaper=[[New York Times]]|date=17 April 1860 |title=Amusements }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=Note&gt;The newspaper also reported a near disaster when her dress caught on fire from the footlights. The baritone was able to extinguish the fire by folding the dress over the flames. "As it is, the lesson will not, we trust be thrown away on the proprietors of the Winter Garden. No footlight should be allowed to exist without a wire guard. Madame Fabbri's courage in an emergency which would have taxed the nerves of the strongest man, was extraordinary. She did not even break the continuity of the note she was singing, until compelled to do so by a torrent of applause." ''NYT'' (17 April 1860)&lt;/ref&gt;

Her debut at the Winter Garden was followed by tours in the American Mid-West, Canada and the Caribbean Islands. She was especially well received in Puerto Rico but lost all her  possessions in a fire.&lt;ref name=emerson/&gt; In 1862–1863, she and her husband returned to Europe on a tour. From May 1863 to March 1864, she sang thirty-seven performances at the Wiener Hofoper in  roles which included Elvira and Leonore in Verdi's ''[[Ernani]]'' and ''[[Il Trovatore]]'', Raquel in Halévy's ''[[La Juive]]'', and Alice and Berthe in Meyerbeer's ''[[Robert le diable (opera)|Robert le diable]]'' and ''[[Le prophète|Le Prophète]]''.&lt;ref name=ost/&gt;

From 1864–1871 they lived in [[Frankfurt am Main]] where Fabbri was engaged to sing at the Stadttheater in roles which included Elisabeth in Wagner's ''[[Tannhäuser (opera)|Tannhäuser]]''. She was described by critics at this time as a soprano with a strong, clear voice suitable for both coloratura and dramatic roles.&lt;ref name=ost/&gt; After a guest performance at the Royal Opera, Covent Garden, she returned to New York in 1872 for an engagement with the Habelmann-Formes opera company.

===San Francisco===
[[File:Inez Fabbri 1872.jpg|thumb|Inez Fabbri in San Francisco in 1872]]

In 1872, she went to San Francisco with the company where she sang at the [[California Theatre (San Francisco)|California Theatre]]. She and her husband settled there and from 1873 to 1874 they produced forty-three operas, staging the first production of ''[[Die Zauberflöte]]'' in the city. Her husband founded a music school in San Francisco which she took over on his death in 1874. She continued to give concerts and to produce operas, many of which she performed in herself.&lt;ref name=ost/&gt; From 1875 to 1876 she directed and sang in sixty operas. Her repertoire included some forty-six different roles.&lt;ref name=emerson/&gt;

On 17 January 1876, she inaugurated the new opera house, later renamed the Grand Opera House, in ''Snow Flake! And The Seven Pigmies''.&lt;ref&gt;Max Maretzek (1860) ''Winter Garden Italian Opera''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later years==
In 1878, she married, secondly, the baritone Jacob Müller (or Muller), a former student of her late husband. In 1881, she ended her singing career but continued  her activities as an impresaria. After large financial losses she lived in Los Angeles from 1891 but later returned to San Francisco where she again lost her assets in a fire believed to be arson.&lt;ref name=ost/&gt; In 1901, her second husband died. In 1905 she produced an opera for the last time.

==Death==
She died in [[San Francisco, California]] in 1909, aged 78.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F30F15F73C5512738DDDA80B94D0405B898CF1D3|title=Obituary: Mme.

'''Jack and Jill''' is a format of competition in partner dancing, where the competing couples are the result of random matching of [[Lead and follow|leader]]s and [[Ballroom glossary#Follower|follower]]s. Rules of matching vary. 

The name and format were created by [[Jack Carey (dancer)|Jack Carey]] at Hank &amp; Stans in [[Norwalk, California]] in the early 1950s to encourage a variety of dancers to enter competitions.&lt;ref&gt;Dance Terminology Notebook. Skippy Blair. 1994. Altera. p. 37, 38. {{ISBN|0-932980-11-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.swingdancecouncil.com/halloffame2.html#carey Swing Dance Council Hall of Fame, page 2] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722000314/http://www.swingdancecouncil.com/halloffame2.html#carey |date=July 22, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The gender-ambiguous term ''Pat and Chris'' has been used, particularly in LGBT dance venues, to refer to events where the gender of lead and follow isn't specified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com/entertainment/2009/02/12/leading_the_way_one_salsa_class_at_a_time.html|title=Leading the way, one salsa class at a time|author=Sarah Barmak|work=torontostar.com|publisher=Toronto Star Newspapers Ltd|date=February 12, 2009|accessdate=May 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In dance competitions J&amp;J is included as a separate division (or divisions, with additional gradations).
J&amp;J is popular at [[Swing (dance)|Swing]] conventions, as well as at [[ballroom dance]] competitions in the US.

J&amp;J competitions are intended to test social dance skills, whereas fixed partner competitions test performance dance skills.

== Rules ==

Rules vary, depending on country and dance style.

In the UK, it is normal to randomly assign fixed couples, and then keep those couples fixed throughout the competition (for example, if there are multiple rounds). Thus, the winner is largely decided by luck of the draw, with the winning couple often being regular dance partners who were lucky enough to be paired together. As a result, DWAS competitions are not taken as seriously as fixed partner competitions.

In the US, Jack &amp; Jill contests are extremely popular in the national [[West Coast Swing]] and [[Lindy Hop]] communities.  Rules vary in events across the country but three rules seem to be standard in most Jack &amp; Jill contests:  1) no [[choreography]] is allowed, 2) no costumes are allowed, and 3) no lifts or drops are allowed.  However, at the Champion or Invitational level, event organizers will occasionally opt for an "anything goes" Jack &amp; Jill in which no rules apply. Music for each dance is selected at random without the participants' prior knowledge, though some competitions will allow them to select the tempo (speed) or a sub-style within their dance's music (e.g. Blues or contemporary within West Coast Swing). 

Although it is not the case in ''every'' Jack &amp; Jill contest, it is somewhat typical for dancers to be judged individually, then dancers who make any elimination rounds redraw for new partners.  Depending on rules specific to the event/competition, a Jack &amp; Jill competitor may or may not be allowed to dance with their regular competition partner (one that they compete with in a choreographed division).  At some events/competitions they are required to redraw; and some events that don't have the redraw rule give dancers the option to decline if they draw their regular competition partner but do not ''require'' them to do so.  Some dancers who draw their regular [choreographed division] partner see this "luck" as more of a competition handicap, feeling that the crowd and possibly the judges will more closely scrutinize them, expecting even more of their competition performance than competitors who do not draw their regular partners.

One of the key elements of a Jack &amp; Jill contest in the US West Coast Swing and Lindy Hop communities is the element of [[improvisation]], which is why choreography is not allowed.  This improv-based feature can prove to be extremely entertaining as dancers try to coordinate dancing with this new partner while dancing to the specific characteristics of a random song or "expressing [[musicality]]". Since the spirit of improvisation can possibly be dampened by the dancers having drawn their partner, it is often more difficult for the dancers to perform to the expectations of the spectators and the judges.  Some dancers, however, are able to perform at or above the expectations depending on various factors, usually unpredictable factors such as the song, the consistency of the dance floor, or even just the simple factor of how they feel at that particular time.  This can be compared to the American football adage "(on) Any Given Sunday".

'''Jungle''' or '''Dou Shou Qi''' ({{zh|t=鬥獸棋|p=dòushòuqí|l=fighting animal game}}) is a modern Chinese [[board game]] with an obscure history.{{sfnp|Parlett|1999|pp=142–43|ps=, "R. C. Bell describes this contemporary Chinese game sent him in the 1960s by a correspondent in Hong Kong, but knows nothing of its ancestry. The board design suggests some influence of Chinese Chess, and the perfection of the game—it 'plays well'—suggests a solid period of experimentation and refinement; yet the concept as a whole appears too sophisticated to have much of a history behind it."}}{{sfnp|Pritchard|2007|p=292|ps=, "Origins obscure; in the opinion of Bell, possibly a development of xiangqi."}} The game is played on a 7×9 board and is popular with children in the [[Far East]].&lt;ref name="Pritchard_FBG"&gt;Pritchard (1994), p. 163.&lt;/ref&gt; The game is also known as '''The Jungle Game''', '''Children's Chess''', '''Oriental Chess''', and '''Animal Chess'''.&lt;ref&gt;Pritchard (2007), p. 292.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Jungle is a two-player [[Abstract strategy game|strategy]] game and has been cited as resembling the [[Western world|Western]] game ''[[Stratego]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Freeman, Jon. (1979). ''[[The Playboy Winner's Guide to Board Games]]''.  New York: Playboy Press. {{ISBN|0-87216-562-0}}. Retrieved January 29, 2007 from {{cite web |url=http://edcollins.com/stratego/stratego-freeman.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-01-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080204011716/http://edcollins.com/stratego/stratego-freeman.htm |archivedate=2008-02-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; but ''Stratego'' actually has more in common with another Chinese board game known as [[Luzhanqi|Jun Qi]] ({{zh|t=軍棋|p=jūnqí|l=army game}}).

==Overview==
The Jungle gameboard represents a jungle terrain with dens, traps "set" around dens,&lt;ref name="Bell83"&gt;Bell (1983), p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt; and rivers.&lt;ref name=Parlett_p143 /&gt; Each player controls eight game pieces representing different animals of various rank. Stronger-ranked animals can capture ("eat") animals of weaker or equal rank. The player who is first to maneuver any one of their pieces into the opponent's den wins the game.&lt;ref name="Parlett_p143"&gt;Parlett (1999), p. 143.&lt;/ref&gt; An alternative way to win is to capture all the opponent's pieces.

==Board==
The Jungle {{boardgloss|gameboard}}, usually made of paper,&lt;ref name=Pritchard_FBG /&gt; consists of seven {{chessgloss|file|columns}} and nine {{chessgloss|rank|rows}} of squares (7×9 rectangle = 63 squares). Pieces move on the squares as in [[chess]], not on the grid lines as in [[xiangqi]]. Pictures of eight animals and their names appear on each side of the board to indicate initial placement of the game pieces. After initial setup, these designated squares have no special meaning in the {{boardgloss|gameplay}}.

There are several special squares and areas of the Jungle board: 
* Each player has one ''den'' ({{zh|t=獸穴|p=shòuxuè|l=lair}}) square located in the centre of their first row of the board and labeled as such in Chinese. 
* Three ''traps'' ({{zh|t=陷阱|p=xiànjǐng|l=[[Animal trapping#Snares|snare]]}}) border each den, to each side and in front. These are also labeled in Chinese. 
* Two water areas or ''rivers'' ({{zh|t=河川|pinyin=héchuān|l=river}}) are located in the centre of the board, each comprising 6 squares in a 2×3 rectangle, and labeled with the Chinese characters for "river". There are single columns of ordinary land squares on the edges of the board, and down the middle between the rivers.

==Pieces==
Each player has eight game pieces representing different animals, each with a different rank, and in their own colour (blue versus red).&lt;ref name=Bell79_p69 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Pritchard_FBG /&gt;&lt;ref name=Parlett_p143 /&gt; The animal ranking, from strongest to weakest, is:

|-

|-
|align=center|2 || [[Cat]] || {{zh|c=貓|p=māo}}
|-
|align=center|1 || [[Rat]] || {{zh|c=鼠|p=shǔ}}
|}

Pieces start on squares with pictures corresponding to their animal, which are invariably shown on the Jungle board.

==Rules==

===Movement===
Players alternate moves with Blue moving first.&lt;ref name="Bell83"&gt;Bell (1983), p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt; During their turn, a player must move. All pieces can move one square horizontally or vertically (not diagonally). A piece may not move into its own den. Animals of either side can move into and out of any trap square.&lt;ref&gt;Bell (1979), p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt; 

There are special rules related to the ''water squares'':
* The ''rat'' is the only animal that may go onto a water square. 
* The ''lion'' and ''tiger'' can jump over a river horizontally or vertically. They jump from a square on one edge of the river to the next non-water square on the other side. If that square contains an enemy piece of equal or lower rank, the lion or tiger capture it as part of their jump. A jumping move is blocked (not permitted) if a rat of either color currently occupies any of the intervening water squares.

===Capturing===
Animals capture opponent pieces by "killing/eating" them (the attacking piece {{boardgloss|displacement capture|replaces}} the captured piece on its square; the captured piece is removed from the game). A piece can capture any enemy piece that has the same or lower rank, with the following exceptions:

* The rat can "kill" (capture) an elephant, but only from a land square, not from a water square. {{parabr}}Many published versions of the game say the rat kills the elephant by "running into its ear and gnawing into its brain".&lt;ref name=Bell83 /&gt;  
* A rat in the water is invulnerable to capture by any piece on land. (Therefore a rat in the water can only be killed by another rat in the water.) 
* A piece that enters one of the opponent's trap squares is reduced in rank to 0. Thus the trapped piece may be captured by the defending side with any piece, regardless of rank. A trapped piece has its normal rank restored when it exits an opponent's trap square.

==Strategy==
{{expand section|date=July 2018}}

==Variations==
There are some commonly played {{boardgloss|ruleset}} variations, as follows:
* The elephant may not kill the rat under any circumstances.
* Some play the game with the lion and tiger being equally strong, whereby they can kill each other. This is the more modern version.
* Some versions have the tiger outranking the lion.
* The leopard may jump over the river horizontally but not vertically (due to its lesser strength than the tiger or lion). It cannot jump over a rat in the river, however.
* All traps are universal. If an animal goes into a trap in its own region, an opponent animal is able to capture it regardless of rank difference if it is beside the trapped animal.  The rules for being on one's own trap do vary.
* A variant has the wolf stronger than the dog. Also the wolf replaced by the ''fox'', in which case the dog is stronger than the fox.
* There are variations in which the lion is not able to jump across the river horizontally.
* The rules for the rat to capture either the elephant or rat from or into the water do vary.
* There is a simplified version called Animal Checkers, which has no traps or rivers, and only the rat, dog, tiger and elephant.&lt;ref&gt;Animal Checkers. (2007). Retrieved May 20, 2007 from http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~cs3411/07s1/hw3/.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Amongst the many examples shown on [[BoardGameGeek]] there is at least one where the pieces are designed so that they are no longer visible by the opponent (mounted as a card on a stand like ''Stratego'' pieces). This change alters the game from one of stochastic '[[Perfect information|full-knowledge]]' to one of partial-knowledge.
* There is a version of the game that limits which animals (rankings 1–4) can move onto the trap squares.
* Some players prefer allowing the dog to move onto water squares.

==Differences between versions==

The ''Angel'' DVD sets were released in at least three encoding formats:

* [[DVD region code#Region codes and countries|Region 1]] (United States and Canada), in [[NTSC]] format
* [[DVD region code#Region codes and countries|Region 2]] (United Kingdom and Europe), in [[PAL]] format
* [[DVD region code#Region codes and countries|Region 4]] (Australia and New Zealand), in PAL format

Unlike the [[Buffy the Vampire Slayer DVDs|''Buffy the Vampire Slayer'' DVDs]], the choice of widescreen versus standard screen does not vary by region. In all regions, season one of ''Angel'' is presented in the [[Aspect ratio (image)#4:3 standard|standard format (4:3)]], and seasons two through five are presented in [[Aspect ratio (image)#16:9 standard|widescreen (16:9)]]. This matches the way the show itself was broadcast from seasons 3-5, although in the U.S. season 2 was presented as standard format but was changed to widescreen for the DVD. This change did lead to some issues on the season 2 DVD release, such as instances where objects that would have remained outside of the broadcast image on the standard format become apparent, creating evident mistakes (e.g. Angel's usually-invisible reflection being visible in the extremities of a number of shots in the first episode).

Aside from the region encoding (and the packaging), the Region 2 and Region 4 DVDs are identical.  However, there are several content differences between the Region 1 DVDs and the Region 2 and 4 DVDs.

=== Scenes from previous episodes ===

The Region 2 and 4 DVDs (except Season 1) include the scenes from previous episodes ("Previously on ''Angel''") at the beginning of each episode; the Region 1 DVDs do not, except in Season 5.

=== Subtitles ===

In the Region 2 and 4 releases, episodes with commentaries include two English subtitles: the show itself, and the commentary. The Region 1 releases do not offer subtitles for the commentaries.

The Region 1 DVDs also offer a smaller choice of non-English languages subtitles than the Region 2 and 4 DVDs.

The '''Memphis Crisis Center''' is a 24-hour, 7-day-a-week [[crisis hotline]] serving [[Memphis, Tennessee]] and the [[Western Tennessee]] area..&lt;ref&gt;[http://kc.vanderbilt.edu/tennesseepathfinder/ServiceFinder/Agency.aspx?agency=1381 Tennessee Disability Pathfinder]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The phone number for the Crisis Center is 901-CRISIS7 (901-274-7477) &lt;ref name="crisis7.org"&gt;[http://crisis7.org/ Memphis Crisis Center website]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Crisis Center's purpose is to provide phone counseling and referrals for callers experiencing personal crises.&lt;ref name="crisis7.org"/&gt;  The Crisis Center has 150 volunteers who receive around 20,000 calls each year.&lt;ref name="uthsc.edu"/&gt; Volunteers also answer calls for SeniorBsafe, Narcotics Anonymous, and the Mid-South Sexual Assault Resource Center (MSARC) during after hours and holidays.  The Crisis Center is also the local affiliate for the [[National Suicide Prevention Lifeline]] (1-800-SUICIDE/1-800-273-TALK).&lt;ref name="crisis7.org" /&gt;

The Memphis Crisis Center was founded by Richard G. Farmer and Allen O. Battle in 1970 and was then called "Suicide Prevention Service." &lt;ref name="crisis7.org" /&gt; It was a program of Family Service of the Mid-South.

When Family Service closed in 2009, the Crisis Center submitted a proposal to the [[United Way of America]] for funding as an independent agency. &lt;ref name="crisis7.org" /&gt;   In October 2009, the Crisis Center relocated to a donated building on the campus of the [[University of Tennessee Health Science Center]] &lt;ref name="uthsc.edu"&gt;[http://www.uthsc.edu/news/ne.php?HYPER=/news/october/crisis_center_relocates_to_UTHSC.htm UTHSC: The Crisis Center Relocates to The University of Tennessee Health Science Center Memphis Campus] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101221135653/http://uthsc.edu/news/ne.php?HYPER=%2Fnews%2Foctober%2Fcrisis_center_relocates_to_UTHSC.htm |date=2010-12-21 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2016, the Crisis Center received a cash gift of $30,000 from the [[Mystic society|Mystic Krewe of Pegasus]] from New Orleans.&lt;ref name="donation"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Johnson|first1=Tierra|title=Mardi Gras Krewe reveals $30,000 donation to Memphis Crisis Center|url=http://wreg.com/2016/04/17/mardi-gras-krewe-reveals-30000-donation-to-memphis-crisis-center/|accessdate=5 January 2017|publisher=News Channel 3|date=April 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Borat in Cologne.jpg|thumb|right|200px|''[[Borat! Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan]]'' (or simply Borat) is a 2006 British-American mockumentary comedy film written and produced by British comedian Sacha Baron Cohen who also plays the title character, Borat Sagdiyev, a fictitious Kazakh journalist travelling through the United States recording real-life interactions with Americans.]]
A '''mockumentary''' (a [[portmanteau]] of mock and documentary) or '''docucomedy''' is a type of movie or television show depicting fictional events but presented as a documentary.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/mockumentary|title=the definition of mockumentary|website=Dictionary.com|access-date=2017-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These productions are often used to analyze or comment on [[current events]] and issues by using a fictional setting, or to parody the documentary form itself.&lt;ref name="Campbell"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Campbell |first1=Miranda |year=2007 |title=The mocking mockumentary and the ethics of irony |journal=Taboo: The Journal of Culture and Education |publisher= |volume=11 |issue=1 |pages=53–62 |url=http://freireproject.org/files/Taboo2007BoratIssue.pdf#page=52 |accessdate=26 July 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726065500/http://freireproject.org/files/Taboo2007BoratIssue.pdf#page=52 |archivedate=26 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; While mockumentaries are usually [[comedy|comedic]], [[pseudo-documentary|pseudo-documentaries]] are their dramatic equivalents. However, [[pseudo-documentary]] should not be confused with [[docudrama]], a fictional [[genre]] in which dramatic techniques are combined with documentary elements to depict real events. Also, [[docudrama]] is different from [[docufiction]]; a genre in which documentaries are contaminated with fictional elements.

Mockumentaries are often presented as historical documentaries, with [[B roll]] and talking heads discussing past events, or as ''[[cinéma vérité]]'' pieces following people as they go through various events. Examples emerged during the 1950s when archival film footage became relatively easy to locate.&lt;ref name=Campbell/&gt; A very early example was a short piece on the "[[Spaghetti tree|Swiss Spaghetti Harvest]]" that appeared as an [[April Fools' Day|April fools']] joke on the British television program ''[[Panorama (TV series)|Panorama]]'' in 1957.

The term "mockumentary", which originated in the 1960s, was popularized in the mid-1980s when ''[[This Is Spinal Tap]]'' director [[Rob Reiner]] used it in interviews to describe that film.&lt;ref name=Roscoe&gt;{{Cite book |last=Roscoe |first=Jane |author2=Craig Hight  |title=Faking it: Mock-documentary and the Subversion of Factuality |year=2001 |publisher=Manchester University Press |isbn=0-7190-5641-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia |title=mockumentary, ''n''. |year=2010 |encyclopedia=Oxford Dictionary |publisher=Oxford University Press |url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/american_english/mockumentary |accessdate=1 June 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lT-ONdy2ck&amp;t=1m|title=Paul Shaffer on Late Night, March 20, 1984|first=|last=Don Giller|date=26 December 2015|accessdate=17 October 2017|publisher=[[YouTube]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mockumentaries are often partly or wholly [[improvisational theatre|improvised]], as an unscripted style of acting helps to maintain the pretense of reality. Comedic mockumentaries rarely have [[laugh track]]s, also to sustain the atmosphere, although exceptions exist.

Music "is often employed to expose the ambiguities and fallacies of conventional storytelling; for instance by pointing at the paradoxes of the distinction between [[diegesis|diegetic]] and extradiegetic music"&lt;ref name=Nardi&gt;{{cite book |last= Nardi |first= Carlo |editor1-last= Giuffre |editor-first= Liz |editor2-last= Hayward |editor2-first= Philip |title=Music in Comedy Television: Notes on Laughs |publisher= Routledge |date=2017 |pages=73–87 |chapter=The Mockumentary Sitcom: The Discomfort of Fake Realism |isbn=978-1138193581 |lastauthoramp=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Early examples==
Early work, including [[Luis Buñuel]]'s 1933 ''[[Land Without Bread]]'', [[Orson Welles]]'s 1938 radio broadcast of ''[[The War of the Worlds (radio)|The War of the Worlds]]'', various [[April Fools' Day]] news reports, and ''vérité''-style film and television during the 1960s and 1970s, served as precursor to the genre.&lt;ref name=Roscoe/&gt; Early examples of mock-documentaries include ''The Connection'' (1961), ''[[A Hard Day's Night (film)|A Hard Day's Night]]'', 1964, (written by [[Alun Owen]], purporting to describe several days in the lives of [[The Beatles]], that would be the first feature-length mockumentary), ''[[David Holzman's  Diary]]'', 1967, ''[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1272023/ Pat Paulsen for President]'', 1968, ''[[Take the Money and Run]]'', 1969, ''[[I clowns|The Clowns]]'', 1970, by [[Federico Fellini]] (a peculiar [[hybridity|hybrid]] of [[documentary]] and [[fiction]], a docufiction), and ''[[All You Need Is Cash]]'', 1978. [[Albert Brooks]] was also an early popularizer of the mockumentary style with his film ''[[Real Life (1979 film)|Real Life]]'', 1979, a spoof of a [[PBS]] documentary.

[[Woody Allen]]'s ''Take the Money and Run'' is presented in documentary-style with Allen playing a fictional criminal, Virgil Starkwell, whose crime exploits are "explored" throughout the film.&lt;ref name="Trompe"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7pbJHd6i9nwC&amp;pg=PA343|title=Trompe (-)l'oeil: Imitation &amp; Falsification|last2=Sy-Wonyu|first2=Aïssatou|publisher=University of Le Havre Press|year=2002|isbn=2877753344|series=Publications de l'Université de Rouen|volume=324|page=343|first1=Philippe|last1=Romanski}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jackson Beck]], who used to narrate documentaries in the 1940s, provides the voice-over narration. Fictional interviews are interspliced throughout, especially those of Starkwell's parents who wear [[Groucho Marx]] noses and mustaches. The style of this film was widely appropriated by others and revisited by Allen himself in films such as ''[[Zelig]]'' (1983) and ''[[Sweet and Lowdown]]'' (1999).&lt;ref name=Trompe/&gt;

Early use of the mockumentary format in television comedy may be seen in several sketches from ''[[Monty Python's Flying Circus]]'' (1969–1974), such as "[[List of Monty Python's Flying Circus episodes|Hell's Grannies]]", "[[Piranha Brothers]]", and "[[The Funniest Joke in the World]]". ''[[The Hart and Lorne Terrific Hour]]'' (1970–1971) also featured mockumentary pieces which interspersed both scripted and real-life man-in-the-street interviews, the most famous likely being "The Puck Crisis" in which hockey pucks were claimed to have become infected with a form of [[Dutch elm disease]].

''[[All You Need Is Cash]]'', developed from an early series of sketches in the comedy series ''[[Rutland Weekend Television]]'', is a 1978 television film in mockumentary style about ''[[The Rutles]]'', a fictional band that parodies ''[[The Beatles]]''.

==Since 1980==
===In film===
Since the beginning of the 1980s, the mockumentary format has got considerable attention. The 1980 [[South Africa]]n film ''[[The Gods Must be Crazy]]'' (along with its [[The Gods Must Be Crazy II|1989 sequel]]) is presented in the manner of a [[nature documentary]], with documentary narrator [[Paddy O'Byrne]] describing the events of the film in the manner of a biologist or anthropologist presenting scientific knowledge to viewers. In 1982, ''[[The Atomic Cafe]]'' is a Cold-War era American "mockumentary" film that made use of archival government footage from the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NI4dBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA342&amp;lpg=PA342&amp;dq=%22atomic+cafe%22+mockumentary |title=The Oxford Handbook of Science Fiction |last=Latham |first=Rob |date=2014-09-01 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=9780199838851}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.horrorview.com/movie-reviews/atomic-cafe-the |title=The Atomic Café (1981) |website=Horrorview |quote=Straddling the fence between surrealism and pop culture is this eccentric "mockumentary," subsumed entirely by stock footage from the height of the Cold War. "The Atomic Café" is pieced together with a certain clairvoyant vision that captivates and inspires as the seamless fluency of the film builds to a denouement. In the same neighborhood as "[[Dr. Strangelove]]," this cynically festive mock-serious piece /../ Because the documentary is just that, fashioned entirely out of a seamless montage of newsreel footage, government archives, and military training films, the movie itself is just a deadpan reflection of history's charade executed with an assertive wry humor that makes us question the sanity of Cold War politics.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Woody Allen's 1983 film ''[[Zelig]]'' stars Allen as a curiously nondescript enigma who is discovered for his remarkable ability to transform himself to resemble anyone he is near, and Allen is edited into historical archive footage.&lt;ref name=Trompe/&gt; In 1984, [[Christopher Guest]] co-wrote and starred in the mockumentary ''[[This is Spinal Tap]]'', directed by [[Rob Reiner]]. Guest went on to write and direct other mockumentaries including ''[[Waiting for Guffman]]'', ''[[Best in Show (film)|Best in Show]]'', and ''[[A Mighty Wind]]'', all written with costar [[Eugene Levy]].&lt;ref name=Trompe/&gt;

[[Tim Robbins]]' 1992 film ''[[Bob Roberts]]'' was a mockumentary centered around the senatorial campaign of a right-wing stock trader and folksinger, and the unsavory connections and dirty tricks used to defeat a long-term liberal incumbent played by [[Gore Vidal]]. ''[[Man Bites Dog (film)|Man Bites Dog]]'' is a 1992 [[Belgian]] [[black comedy]] crime mockumentary written, produced, and directed by [[Rémy Belvaux]], [[André Bonzel]], and [[Benoît Poelvoorde]]. In 1995, [[Peter Jackson]] and [[Costa Botes]] directed ''[[Forgotten Silver]]'', which claimed [[New Zealand]] "director" Colin McKenzie was a pioneer in filmmaking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nzonscreen.com/person/colin-mckenzie/biography|title=Colin McKenzie - NZ On Screen|website=Nzonscreen.com|accessdate=17 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the film was later revealed to be a mockumentary, Jackson received criticism for tricking viewers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=F Is for Phony: Fake Documentary And Truth's Undoing |first1=Craig |last1=Hight |first2=Jane |last2=Roscoe |chapter=Forgotten Silver: A New Zealand Television Hoax and Its Audience |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TXaFokB-qx4C&amp;pg=PA172 |pages=171–173 |editor=[[Alexandra Juhasz]] and Jesse Lerner |publisher=U of Minnesota Press |year=2006 |isbn=0816642516 |volume=17 |series=Visible Evidence}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998, director [[Mike Clattenburg]] wrote and directed a [[short film]] titled ''[[List of Trailer Park Boys episodes#Specials|One Last Shot]],'' which was shot in black-and-white. The film followed the exploits, in [[documentary style]], of Ricky ([[Robb Wells]]) and Julian ([[John Paul Tremblay]]), two criminals doing what they did just about every day. In 1999 a sequel [[feature film]] ''[[List of Trailer Park Boys episodes#Specials|Trailer Park Boys]],'' also in black-and-white, was released. Both films serve as prequels to the ''[[Trailer Park Boys]]'' television series. In 1999, ''[[Drop Dead Gorgeous (film)|Drop Dead Gorgeous]]'' by [[Michael Patrick Jann]] used the mockumentary style to narrate a fictional small-town beauty pageant as a way to satirize [[Middle America (United States)|Middle America]].

''[[Dark Side of the Moon (film)|Dark Side of the Moon]]'' is a 2002 French mockumentary by director [[William Karel]]. The premise for the film is the theory that the television footage from the [[Apollo 11]] Moon landing was faked and actually recorded in a studio by the [[CIA]] with help from director [[Stanley Kubrick]]. ''[[FUBAR (film)|FUBAR]]'' is a 2002 Canadian mockumentary film, directed by [[Michael Dowse]], based on the lives of two lifelong friends and head-bangers living out their lives, constantly drinking beer. ''[[King of Bollywood]]'' is a 2004 film, in fact, the first Indian film in the mockumentary genre. Directed by [[Piyush Jha]] it starred the late [[Om Puri]] and British supermodel [[Sophie Dahl]]. It tells the story of an aging Bollywood Superstar and showcases the hilarity, colour, and zany-ness of his many comeback attempts.  ''[[C.S.A.: The Confederate States of America]]'' is a 2004 mockumentary presenting an [[alternative history]] in which the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] won the [[American Civil War]]. 

''[[First on the Moon]]'' (Russian: Первые на Луне, ''Pervye na Lune'') is a 2005 Russian mockumentary about a fictional 1930s Soviet landing on the Moon. ''[[Borat|Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan]]'' is a controversial yet successful film from 2006 which uses this style, as does ''[[Brüno]]'', a similar film from 2009. [[Sony Pictures Animation]] released their second animated feature, ''[[Surf's Up (film)|Surf's Up]]'' in 2007, which was the first of its kind to incorporate the mockumentary style into animation. ''[[REC (film)|REC]]'', a 2007 Spanish film by Jaume Balagueró and Paco Plaza, uses journalism aesthetics to approach a horror universe set up in a real building in [[Barcelona]]. The film was [[remake|remade]] in the [[United States]] as the 2008 film [[Quarantine (2008 film)|''Quarantine'']]. As the first installment of the ''[[REC (film series)|REC film series]]'', it was followed by three sequels; ''[[REC 2]]'' in 2009, ''[[REC 3: Genesis]]'' in 2012, and ''[[REC 4]]'' in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Exclusive: ‘[REC]4 Apocalypse’ Teaser Poster Sees Red!|url=http://bloody-disgusting.com/news/3231637/exclusive-rec4-apocalypse-teaser-poster-sees-red/|work=Bloody Disgusting|publisher=Bloody Disgusting LLC|accessdate=22 June 2013|last=Miska|first=Brad|date=6 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[On the Ropes (2011 film)|On the Ropes]]'' is a 2011 mockumentary film written and directed by [[Mark Noyce]]. The film follows a fictional martial-arts instructor and his rivalry with a local boxing gym.

Hight argues that television is a natural medium for mockumentary, as it provides "for extraordinarily rich sources of appropriation and commentary" &lt;ref&gt;Hight, Craig. 2014. "Mockumentary." In Encyclopedia of Humor Studies, Salvatore Attardo, Thousand Oaks: Sage, pp.  515-516.&lt;/ref&gt;.

The ability to create custom minigolf courses was widely praised among reviewers.

The reviewer from Game Revolution felt that the game's graphics were "very pretty for a downloadable title".&lt;ref name="gamerevolution review" /&gt;  IGN's Daemon Hatfield also felt that the character models were well done, but cited "hiccups" with the camera.&lt;ref name="ign review" /&gt;  [[Adrenaline Vault]] reviewer James Dolbeare felt that the graphics were inconsistent.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4943">'''Production babies''' are children born to anyone involved in the making of a film during its [[filmmaking|production]]. The phrase generally refers to a section of the [[closing credits]] of films, listing the babies' [[given name]]s. The custom of publishing lists of production babies began with [[animated film]]s, and is still chiefly found in that genre, reflecting the influence of family experiences on storytelling in such films.&lt;ref name=sfgate2010/&gt;

The first list of production babies was included by [[Pixar]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dawson|first=Jonathan|title=Cars|url=http://www.abc.net.au/tasmania/stories/s1664829.htm|work=Review|publisher=[[ABC Tasmania]]|accessdate=January 16, 2012|date=June 16, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the credits of their first full-length movie ''[[Toy Story]]'' in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|0114709|Toy Story}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lee Unkrich]], a film director with Pixar, explains that the production team and [[film crew]] indelibly associate the birth of each of their children with the film they were working on at the time. The listing in the end credits becomes a way for them to share these essential memories more widely. "It's like our family lives are permanently woven into the movies."&lt;ref name=sfgate2010&gt;{{cite web|last=Hartlaub|first=Peter|title=Pixar delivers, babies get credit|url=http://articles.sfgate.com/2010-06-13/entertainment/21907955_1_toy-story-john-lasseter-pixar|publisher=[[SFGate]]|accessdate=January 8, 2012|date=June 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Twists added in film credits include a list of "Chameleon Babies" at the end of the 2010 animated film ''[[Tangled]]'', born to the real-life model for the pet in the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Liu|first=Ed|title=A Virtual Roundtable with "Tangled" Co-Directors Byron Howard &amp; Nathan Greno|url=http://www.toonzone.net/news/articles/36987/a-virtual-roundtable-with-tangled-co-directors-byron-howard-amp-nathan-greno|publisher=ToonZone.net|accessdate=January 16, 2012|date=April 7, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110822013323/http://www.toonzone.net/news/articles/36987/a-virtual-roundtable-with-tangled-co-directors-byron-howard-amp-nathan-greno|archivedate=August 22, 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2011 animated film ''[[Winnie the Pooh (2011 film)|Winnie the Pooh]]'' lists the names under "Pooh Babies," with the credit knitted on a piece of fabric by the character [[Kanga (Winnie-the-Pooh)|Kanga]].

[[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] film director [[Byron Howard]] cites the listing of production babies as a pointer to the depth of personal relationships established during collaboration on an animated movie.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hucks|first=Dustin|title=Interviews: The Cast of'' 'Tangled' ''Gets Unraveled|url=http://www.filmschoolrejects.com/features/interviews-the-cast-of-tangled-gets-unraveled.php|publisher=FilmSchoolRejects.com|accessdate=January 8, 2012|date=November 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A star next to a baby's name honors a baby who passed away before production was complete.

In 2009, [[Ari Folman]] dedicated his [[Golden Globe Award for Best Foreign Language Film|Golden Globe Award]] to the eight production babies born during the making of ''[[Waltz with Bashir]]'', an animated anti-war documentary, and expressed hope that their lives would have no contact with the realities of conflict depicted in the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Israel's 'Waltz with Bashir,' on 1982 Lebanon War, wins Golden Globe for best foreign film|url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/israel-s-waltz-with-bashir-on-1982-lebanon-war-wins-golden-globe-for-best-foreign-film-1.267916|accessdate=January 8, 2012|newspaper=[[Haaretz]]|date=January 12, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reviewers have noted that "production babies" credits indicate the creativity of film people in giving some unusual names to their children.&lt;ref name=sfgate2010/&gt;

An early, isolated instance in video games occurred with an [[Easter egg (media)#Software|easter egg]] message embedded in the ROM for the 1988 game ''Spiker! Super Pro Volleyball'' for Mattel [[Intellivision]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The First Production Baby|url=http://daddytypes.com/2013/01/15/the_first_production_baby.php |date=January 15, 2013 |publisher=DaddyTypes |accessdate=January 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The modern custom spread to [[video game]] credits in the 2005 game ''[[Call of Duty 2]]'', and the 2009 game ''[[Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2]]'', which also listed the other parents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2|url=http://www.mobygames.com/game/windows/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-2/credits|work=Credits|publisher=[[MobyGames]]|accessdate=January 8, 2012|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The title of the list was changed to "Development Babies" in ''[[Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3]]''. A number of other games have since done the same.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6813">'''[[Radio]] in [[Honduras]]''' began in 1928, when the Tela Railroad Company established ''Tropical Radio''. The first commercial radio station, ''Radio HRN'', began [[broadcasting]] in 1933.

==History==
In August 1920 a group known as ''Los Chicos del Coliseo'' began broadcasting from [[Teatro Coliseo]] in [[Buenos Aires]], but it would take many years for radio to arrive in places such as the isthmus of Central America. In Honduras, radio experimentation had begun with local transmissions. American companies (known as ''bananeras'') were just a few of the companies providing employment before and after [[World War II]]. 

In 1928 the Tela Railroad Company (one of the two major railroads) had received a license to establish a radio station (known as Tropical Radio). It broadcast on the 51-meter [[Shortwave bands|shortwave band]], and HRB (''La Voz del Trópico'') was the first radio station in Honduras. HRB was not a [[Commercial broadcasting|"commercial" radio station]]. It was a medium for the Tela Railroad Company to broadcast its own bulletins. 

It also played recorded music and featured live performances by local talent (including the Sisters Cordova and pianist Guadalupe Ferrari Hartling), marimba bands, singers, poets and other artists. HRB did not last long, but it inspired several individuals to keep the broadcasting flame alive.

Rafael Ferrari Garcia, an entrepreneur with great ambitions but little money, sold everything he owned to embark on a risky plan; he received permission to install the first commercial radio station in [[Tegucigalpa]]. It was known as ''La Voz del Comercio''; to maintain its operation, he obtained commercial sponsorship from local businesses (retail and professional) and government agencies. From this HRN (''La Primera Emisora del País'') was born; Ferrari was credited as the first radio personality in Honduras. 

The station was founded on November 1, 1933. Kenneth See and Paul John were the principal technical engineers and attorney Manuel Bonilla Rodriguez, Nicholas Odeh, Rodolfo Brevé Martinez and Ferrari were the station’s staff announcers. Bonilla Rodriguez was the first to broadcast a soccer game in 1935 between a [[Costa Rica]]n team and Club Motagua, a renowned Honduran team. Assisting Bonilla as engineer was Nat Lopez Fuentes, from a family radio dynasty known nationwide.

There were only a handful of radio receivers and in order to reach a wide audience Ferrari installed loudspeakers at various locations in Tegucigalpa. This was a daily pastime, an occasion for locals to meet and enjoy the programming. At first the programming was limited to news, government bulletins and recorded music. However, during the 1940s the station acquired a more powerful transmitter, reaching [[DXing|audiences in faraway countries]] with its shortwave signal. 

HRN was important during War World II, since it rebroadcast information from the [[BBC World Service|BBC]] in London and [[NBC Red Network|NBC]] in the United States. Ferrari continued his support of local talent with broadcasts including pianists, marimba bands, orchestras, singers, poets, composers, comedians and amateur artists. After the war, Europe, Asia and North America began to rebuild their economies and Honduras enjoyed some prosperity and tranquility under the Carias Andino regime. 

HRN became one of many private enterprises which enjoyed a modest increase in business. During this time, the station replaced ''La Voz del Comercio'' for its current slogan, ''La Voz de Honduras''. Ferrari expanded the station, providing opportunity to a new generation of promising talent; some became household names, solidifying HRN's position as a powerhouse of Central American radio.

=== Radio America ===
1948 marked the birth of [[Radio America (Honduras)|Radio America]]. At that time Tegucigalpa (the capital) comprised two cities, divided by the Rio Choluteca. It was a small metropolis, both geographically and in population. Radio America broadcast with three [[Watt#Kilowatt|kW]] of power; small by later standards, but sufficient for experimentation. Soon it increased its power to 10 kW, easily reaching audiences in the twin cities of Tegucigalpa and Comayagüela. 

The station was first owned by Sergio Castellón who, within a few years, sold it to Cuban entrepreneur [[Rafael Silvio Peña]]. Peña, bringing the Cuban concept of radio as a fresh approach, began with live performances (especially ''radio-novelas'', or soap-operas). Peña brought in Emilio Díaz; the two developed programs popular in Cuba such as ''"La Tremenda Corte"'', which was known throughout Latin America. Subsequently Dr. Andonie Fernandez bought the station, maintaining its tradition while ushering in a new era.

Several changes took place, the most important of which was the addition of well-known radio personalities and the highest-rated program (''“Platicando con mi Barbero”'', after the cast left HRN). This program featured a group headed by humorist [[Herman Allan Padgett]], considered a genius for his comic range and originality. Padgett had gathered the best-known talent of the time, including Julio Lopez Fuentes, Abelardo Enrique Avendaño and Ricardo Antonio Redondo Licona. Like HRN, Radio America strives to improve; Fernandez created a conglomerate within the communications industry in [[Central America]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://radioamericahn.net/historia/ Radio America history (Spanish).] Retrieved 2011-04-02.&lt;/ref&gt;

This covers the Indian-administered regions of Jammu and Kashmir plus Pakistani-administered [[Azad Kashmir]], Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand.  Sarmal (including Sadmal or Surmal) who are predominantly [[Pahari Rajputs]] are popularly known as [[Pahari Rajputs|Pahari]] Raje  and are thought/believed to belong to [[Suryavansha|Suryavanshi]] Lineage of Hindu Kshatriya Class. These [[Pahari Rajputs]] as lived in the lower hills of Dugar Desh (also known as the [[Dogra]] [[Rajputs|Rajputs)]].  In Rajatarngini, there is mention of Thakkuras, the chiefs of the hills who acknowledged their suzerainty to strong Kashmir rulers. They are being addressed as the Lords of the country by Kalhana.  Sarmals are believed to be the offshoot of these Feudal Lords so referred to as Thakkuras.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=979BKkAiQowC&amp;pg=PA194&amp;lpg=PA194&amp;dq=Thakkuras&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Wq2xH9Y42K&amp;sig=ntttrX9KE40w_ijiDPa0T6BB2v0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwinz7SPj4rcAhVfOMAKHX3yC-UQ6AEILDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Thakkuras&amp;f=false|title=Thakkuras Reference (Published)|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contribution in Feudal set up of Kashmir==

Mohd. Habib regards them as the actual fighters in India, much like the knights of Europe. In his words, "the thakur could face death, that was easy for him, but he could not risk captivity".&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite book | title = Mohd. Habib, Introd. to Elliot &amp; Dowson, Vol. II, p.44}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were so proficient in fighting that their spirit could be successfully maintained by them until old age. They provided the sure quota of soldiers required during the wars and monarch set up of Kashmir. They were lovers of horses, archery and swords.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite book | first = John Hutchinson | last = Jean Philippe Vogel|title= History of the Panjab Hill States | place = [[New Delhi]], [[India]] | publisher = J Jately For AES | year = 1994 |edition = Reprint | isbn = 81-206-0943-3|}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Kalhana]] Rajatarngini, these Hill-Rajas or Thakurs,&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite book | first = M. A. | last = Stein | title = Kalhana's Rajatarangini: A Chronicle of the Kings of Kashmir | place = [[Srinagar]], [[India]] | publisher = Saujanya Books | year = 2007 | volume = 1-3 | edition = Reprint | isbn = 81-8339-043-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  are presented as playing a significant role in Kashmiri politics from the 11th century onward.
The Hill-Rajas allied their houses with the royal house of Kashmir through marriage. The kings of Kashmir played a correspondingly powerful role in the local politics of the Hill-Rajas. The goodwill or obedience of the Hill-Rajas must always have been a desideratum for the kings of Kashmir, in order to regulate contact between themselves and the powers of the north Indian plains.

==Vansh And Dynasty==

Sarmals belongs to Survayansha Dynasty. It is the dynasty in which Incarnation of Lord Ram took place.

*VANSH= Suryavansh
*GOTRA= Bhardwaj

Sun dynasty is oldest among the [[kshatriyas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Suryavansha|date=2018-07-06|work=Wikipedia|language=en|access-date=2018-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology== 
The societies in the Himalayan region, from Jammu to Himachal Pradesh and from Himachal to Uttrakhand have a similar pattern of history, where numerous small kingdoms were scattered over hills and small valleys.
To term it more precisely, these kingdoms was rather fortified villages of warrior—landlords known as Thakurs and Ranas.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last= Aśoka Jeratha|first=|title=Dogra Legends of Art &amp; Culture|year=1998 |publisher=Indus publishing company, New Delhi|ISBN= 81-7387-082-9 |p=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Hutchison|first=J &amp; Vogel

&lt;/ref&gt; 

These Feudal Lords were Rajputs by lineage. Most of the Rajput groups in this region originated from these kingdoms, the name of which became the name of their clan.Actually, similar for Sarmal Clan which have its origin in Sauram hills of Dugar region of Samba District of Jammu &amp; Kashmir.

'''Television in Peru''' has a history of more than fifty years.  There are 105 television broadcasters in Peru, 22 of which are in Lima.  In regard to television receivers, in 2003 there were 5,470,000 — that is 200 televisions for every thousand inhabitants.  The number of cable subscribers was 967,943 in 2011.&lt;ref name=OSIPTEL75&gt;OSIPTEL - Organismo Regulador de las Telecomunicaciones del Perú, ''[http://www.osiptel.gob.pe/WebsiteAjax/WebFormgeneral/sector/wfrm_Consulta_Informacion_Estadisticas.aspx?CodInfo=13474&amp;CodSubCat=864&amp;TituloInformacion=6.%20Indicadores%20de%20Televisi%C3%B3n%20de%20Paga&amp;DescripcionInformacion= Suscriptores de TV paga por empresa]''&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The first experimental tramnsmission of television in Peru occurred on September 21, 1939, transmitting a film and an artistic program from Nuestra Señora de Guadalupe school in Lima.  Another test transmission was made by Antonio Pereyra from the Bolivar Hotel on May 28, 1954. On January 17, 1958, the Ministry of Education and [[UNESCO]] inaugurated the State Channel 7 and conducted a test broadcast.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.resumendehistoria.com/2009/01/cuando-nacio-la-television-peruana.html Resumen de Historia: Los 51 años de la televisión peruana]&lt;/ref&gt; The first commercial television broadcast was on Channel 4 Radio América in Lima, on December 15, 1958 by Nicanor González and José Antonio Umbert.  Channel 4 Radio America's creation was possible because of an agreement with [[NBC]] and [[RCA]].

Several commercial television stations followed, including Channel 2 (Radiodifusora Victoria S.A.), Channel 13 — later changed to Channel 5 (Panamericana Televisión S.A.), Channel 9 (Compañía Peruana de Producciones Radiales y TV), Channel 11 (Bego Televisión S.A.). Many of them soon acquired — or were associated with — stations outside Metropolitan Lima.  In just two months, November and December 1959, Lima stores recorded sales of 10,000 television sets, and full page ads in newspapers and magazines announced the start of the era of television in Peru. By April 1960, there were 55,000 television sets operating in the Peruvian capital.  The growth was explosive, considering the fact that in 1958 there were only 5,000 televisions.

== Digital television ==
On March 30, 2010, Peru starts digital television transition, with [[TV Perú]] being the first television station to begin broadcast digitally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Peru begins digital TV transition process today|url=http://www.andina.com.pe/ingles/Noticia.aspx?id=RJgVCDlyJtA=|accessdate=25 January 2014|newspaper=Andina (Agencia Peruana De Noticias)|date=30 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The analog broadcast in Peru will be discontinued in 2020.

[[File:The Concise Guide To Sounding Smart At Parties cover art.jpg|thumb|''The Concise Guide to Sounding Smart at Parties'' book cover]]

'''''The Concise Guide To Sounding Smart At Parties: An Irreverent Compendium of Must Know Info From Sputnik to Smallpox and Marie Curie to Mao''''' is a humorous collection of [[Popular culture|pop-culture]] knowledge published by [[Broadway Books]], an imprint of the [[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday Broadway Publishing Group]] which is a division of [[Random House|Random House Inc]].  Authors [[David Matalon]] and [[Chris Woolsey]] are [[screenwriter]]s and [[actor]]s in [[Los Angeles]].

The book is structured so that each chapter can help the reader master a different facet of pop-culture knowledge ranging from [[art]] to [[politics]] and [[religion]] to [[business]].

The forward for the book was written by [[Michael J. Nelson]], former host and head writer of ''[[Mystery Science Theater 3000]]'' and [[author]] of ''Love Sick''.  The book was featured on ''[[Good Morning America]]'', ''[[Fox and Friends]]'', ''[[Oprah Winfrey|Oprah]] and Friends with [[Gayle King]]'', and ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]''.

The book caused some controversy when a rumor appeared on ''[[Page Six]]'' of the ''[[New York Post]]'' that suggested that [[Britney Spears]]' ex-husband, [[Kevin Federline]] showed up at the [[Hollywood]] launch party for the book and asked the authors for some pointers on how he could sound smart.

In the film, [[Maggie Simpson]] is enrolled at a new daycare facility where she squares off with the foul-tempered [[List of recurring The Simpsons characters#Baby Gerald|Baby Gerald]] when she befriends a caterpillar. The short originated with ''Simpsons'' producer [[James L. Brooks]], who enlisted long-time veteran of the series, [[David Silverman (animator)|David Silverman]], to direct the film. The picture was written by producers Brooks, [[Al Jean]], [[David Mirkin]], writers [[Michael Price (writer)|Michael Price]] and [[Joel H. Cohen]], as well as show creator [[Matt Groening]]. The events of the short film take place between the [[The Simpsons (season 23)|twenty-third]] and [[The Simpsons (season 24)|twenty-fourth]] seasons of ''The Simpsons''.

The film premiered on July 13, 2012, where it was attached to screenings of the [[20th Century Fox]] release ''[[Ice Age: Continental Drift]]''. The film is the second ''Simpsons'' theatrical release. The short was re-released on February 15, 2013 and played before the film ''[[Life of Pi (film)|Life of Pi]]'' in selected theaters in USA. Reception has been positive, praising the storytelling and animation. The film was nominated for an [[Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film]] in [[85th Academy Awards|2013]], losing to ''[[Paperman]]''.&lt;ref name="oscarnom" /&gt;

==Plot==
[[Marge Simpson]] drops off [[Maggie Simpson|Maggie]] at the [[A Streetcar Named Marge|Ayn Rand School for Tots]], where, after going through a security screening, she is classified as being of "average intelligence", by a machine manufactured by "Often-Wrong Technologies". A guard then carries her past the "Room for Gifted Babies" and puts her in the "Nothing Special" dreary corner.  The playtime items are either taken away or eaten by the other babies.  A butterfly then makes its way into the room as Maggie's nemesis, [[Baby Gerald]], squashes and kills it on the wall with a mallet and draws a box around it with a [[crayon]].  A second butterfly also meets the same fate.  Maggie finds a caterpillar and a [[pop-up book]] about the [[Butterfly#Life cycle|life cycle of the butterfly]].  Realizing that the caterpillar could also meet the fate of the first two butterflies, she tries to protect it from Gerald.  The caterpillar later encases itself in a [[chrysalis]] and starts to transform.  Once the newly formed butterfly emerges, Maggie tries to help it fly out of the window, but Gerald seemingly kills it by shutting the blinds on it as it attempts to pass through.  Maggie dramatically mourns as she falls to the floor.  Marge then arrives to pick her up, when it is revealed Maggie's scene was only a [[Ruse of war|ruse]] to cover the truth: she had slipped her hair bow onto the windowsill and wore the butterfly on her forehead in its place.  She then sets the butterfly free as Marge drives her home.

==Development==
[[File:Jameslbrooks.jpg|alt=James L. Brooks standing in a crowd being photographed|150px|thumb|left|''[[The Simpsons]]'' executive producer [[James L. Brooks]] conceived the idea of producing a short film based on the series.]]
The origins of ''The Longest Daycare'' came about when ''The Simpsons'' executive producer [[James L. Brooks]] proposed the idea of making a short film and releasing it in cinemas in front of a feature film—similar to how animation film studio [[Pixar]] creates shorts to play before their feature films.&lt;ref name="snierson" /&gt; He wanted the short to be a fun gift for the fans of ''The Simpsons'', and according to the series' [[showrunner]] [[Al Jean]], "We [the staff] just wanted to do this as a way of saying, 'We appreciate how much people have stayed with the show and watched it for 25 years.'"&lt;ref name="snierson" /&gt; Brooks picked [[David Silverman (animator)|David Silverman]], long-time veteran of the series and director of ''[[The Simpsons Movie]]'' (2007) to oversee the film.&lt;ref name="snierson" /&gt; Silverman gave credit to [[Richard Sakai]] for the idea to produce the film in stereoscopic 3-D. He considered the reasoning for employing 3-D "hard to describe," noting that was largely an experiment and its genesis was born out of "having fun."&lt;ref name="awn"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hr"/&gt;
[[File:David Silverman in 2007-cropped.JPG|150px|thumb|right|The film was directed by [[David Silverman (animator)|David Silverman]].]]
The group first gathered in March 2011—consisting of Brooks, Silverman, Al Jean, [[David Mirkin]], writers [[Joel H. Cohen|Joel Cohen]] and [[Michael Price (writer)|Michael Price]], and ''Simpsons'' creator [[Matt Groening]] via phone—to pitch ideas for a short. Early on, it was decided to keep it entirely silent and employ Maggie as the lead character, and the setting of a daycare was decided upon.&lt;ref name="hr"/&gt; Jean wrote the [[Film treatment|treatment]] for the film, and Silverman completed an [[animatic]] of early story reels in June 2011. By the following February, the team regrouped to structure the story and formulate more ideas.&lt;ref name="awn"/&gt; With the help of Brad Ableson, Erick Tran and Ben Lane, the storyboards and animatic for the short were approved and the film entered production. Silverman himself animated two shots present in the final film.&lt;ref name="am"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.animationmagazine.net/features/animated-people-matt-groening-david-silverman/|title=Animated People: Matt Groening &amp; David Silverman|author= Mercedes Milligan |date=January 28, 2013|publisher=''[[Animation Magazine]]''|accessdate=July 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Silverman and his crew began animation work on the short in March 2012, completing in May after just under ten weeks of production. He considered his crew "very experienced", noting that he worked with stereographer Eric Kurland for the 3-D shots.&lt;ref name="awn"/&gt; It was animated with ''The Simpsons''{{'s}} usual production pipeline, which involved sending shots to [[AKOM]] in [[South Korea]], but with an amplified focus on the 3-D.  The team would attempt to complete ten scenes to send to AKOM per week, which would be returned in a cleaned-up form after two weeks.&lt;ref name="am"/&gt; Shots were then composited together at Film Roman out of necessity as the backgrounds relied on the 3-D.&lt;ref name="awn"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.awn.com/animationworld/david-silverman-talks-maggie-simpson-longest-daycare|title=David Silverman Talks 'Maggie Simpson in "The Longest Daycare"|author= Dan Sarto|date=February 7, 2013|publisher=Animation World Network|accessdate=July 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most stereo elements for 3-D were picked out after shots were cleaned up, while others were manipulated in post-production with After Effects.&lt;ref name="awn"/&gt; The short was more costly than the average episode of the television show.&lt;ref name="hr"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/race/david-silverman-guiding-simpsons-oscars-422067|title=David Silverman on Guiding 'The Simpsons' to the Oscars via 'The Longest Daycare'|author= Scott Feinberg|date=February 18, 2013|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|accessdate=July 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Release==
''The Longest Daycare'' was first announced to the public in a title card at the end of the series' twenty-third-season finale "[[Lisa Goes Gaga]]" that aired on May 20, 2012.&lt;ref name="snierson" /&gt; It was revealed that the short would be shown in theaters in the United States prior to screenings of the film ''[[Ice Age: Continental Drift]]'', starting on July 13, 2012. Like ''The Simpsons'', ''Ice Age: Continental Drift'' was produced by [[20th Century Fox]].&lt;ref name="snierson" /&gt; A teaser trailer for ''The Longest Daycare'', lasting approximately five seconds, was released on July 3, 2012.&lt;ref name="trailers" /&gt; This was the second time that characters from ''The Simpsons'' appeared on the big screen, as ''[[The Simpsons Movie]]'' was released in 2007. Coincidentally, the trailer for that film was first attached to screenings of the ''Continental Drift'' predecessor ''[[Ice Age: The Meltdown]]''.&lt;ref name="snierson" /&gt;

A 2D version of the short was displayed by the producers of ''The Simpsons'' at the series' panel at [[San Diego Comic-Con International]] on July 14, 2012.&lt;ref name="snierson" /&gt;&lt;ref name="comiccon" /&gt;

It had its world television premiere on [[Network Ten]] in Australia on February 17, 2013 at 6.25pm,&lt;ref name="foxitaly" /&gt; 5 hours before it premieres on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] in the USA but 16 hours later in real time due to time zone differences, right after ''[[The Simpsons]]'' episode "[[Hardly Kirk-ing]]".&lt;ref name="foxus" /&gt; It was also aired in the UK on the same day on Sky 1 at 9.55am, 12 noon and 7.30pm and on Channel 4 at 1.30pm [[GMT]]. It also premiered on the same day, at 7.55pm on Prima COOL, in the Czech Republic and on FOX Brasil at 8.30pm.

After being nominated for an [[Academy Award]], ''The Longest Daycare'' was released along with all the other 15 Oscar-nominated short films in theaters by [[ShortsHD]].&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite web|work=[[The New York Times]]|title=Oscar Nominated Short Films 2013|year=2013|url=https://www.nytimes.com/slideshow/2013/02/01/movies/awardsseason/oscar-shorts.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NYT2&gt;{{cite web|work=[[The New York Times]]|title=The Longest Daycare|year=2013|url=https://www.nytimes.com/slideshow/2013/02/01/movies/awardsseason/oscar-shorts-2.html?_r=0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
''The Longest Daycare'' has received critical acclaim. Many film critics have said that the short was better than ''Ice Age: Continental Drift''.&lt;ref name="nypost" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Spake" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Puig"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Paatsch" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Biancolli" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Williams" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Lin" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Scott-12/07" /&gt; Claudia Puig of ''[[USA Today]]'' argued that "the brief tale is far more clever and whimsical than any sequence in ''Ice Age''."&lt;ref name=Puig&gt;{{cite news|last=Puig|first=Claudia|title=Fourth 'Ice Age' adrift in the same old story|date=2012-07-12|accessdate=2012-07-13|url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/movies/reviews/story/2012-07-12/ice-age-continental-drift/56181850/1?csp=34life|newspaper=[[USA Today]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, ''[[Sun Herald]]'' critic Leigh Paatsch said the short "displays all the wit and creativity missing from ''Continental Drift''."&lt;ref name="Paatsch"&gt;{{cite news|last=Paatsch|first=Leigh|title=Movie review: Ice Age: Continental Drift|url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/entertainment/movies/movie-review-ice-age-continental-drift/story-e6frf8r6-1226412234619|accessdate=2012-07-13|newspaper=[[Sun Herald]]|date=2012-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' writer Amy Biancolli commented that the short is "only a few minutes long, but those few minutes boast more imagination, pathos and suspense than the entire film that follows."&lt;ref name=Biancolli&gt;{{cite news|last=Biancolli|first=Amy|title='Ice Age: Continental Drift' review: mostly nutty|url=http://www.sfgate.com/movies/article/Ice-Age-Continental-Drift-review-mostly-nutty-3702988.php|accessdate=2012-07-13|newspaper=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]|date=2012-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Joe Williams of the ''[[St. Louis Post-Dispatch]]'' wrote that while the short takes place in a daycare, it ironically features more "artistic maturity" than ''Continental Drift''.&lt;ref name=Williams&gt;{{cite news|last=Williams|first=Joe|title=The latest 'Ice Age' deserves the cold shoulder|url=http://www.stltoday.com/entertainment/movies/reviews/the-latest-ice-age-deserves-the-cold-shoulder/article_7e567a3e-cac4-11e1-828a-0019bb30f31a.html|accessdate=2012-07-13|newspaper=[[St. Louis Post-Dispatch]]|date=2012-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Longest Daycare'' has been praised for being both humorous and emotional. Puig and Biancolli described the short as "hilarious".&lt;ref name=Puig/&gt;&lt;ref name=Biancolli/&gt; Bill Goodykoontz of ''[[The Arizona Republic]]'' stated that the film is "terrific—sweet, sad, funny, surprising,"&lt;ref name=Goodykoontz&gt;{{cite news|last=Goodykoontz|first=Bill|title='Ice Age: Continental Drift,' 3 stars|url=http://www.azcentral.com/thingstodo/movies/articles/2012/07/10/20120710ice-age-continental-drift-movie-review-goodykoontz.html|accessdate=2012-07-13|newspaper=[[The Arizona Republic]]|date=2012-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Kristian Lin of ''[[Fort Worth Weekly]]'' said it is "clever" and "surprisingly moving".&lt;ref name=Lin&gt;{{cite news|last=Lin|first=Kristian|title=A Fourth Ice Age|url=http://www.fwweekly.com/2012/07/11/fourth-ice-age/|accessdate=2012-07-13|newspaper=[[Fort Worth Weekly]]|date=2012-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Writing for ''[[St. Paul Pioneer Press|Pioneer Press]]'', Chris Hewitt noted that Maggie's interaction with Gerald "is hilarious and, ultimately, poignant in an animated film that covers more territory, all without dialogue, than most full-length movies."&lt;ref name=Hewitt/&gt; He went on to call the short a "triumph of storytelling, pacing and big-hearted humor."&lt;ref name=Hewitt&gt;{{cite news|last=Hewitt|first=Chris|title='Ice Age: Continental Drift' review: 'Drift' the operative word here, but some jokes are ageless|url=http://www.twincities.com/hewitt/ci_21059903/ice-age-continental-drift-review-drift-operative-word|accessdate=2012-07-13|newspaper=[[St. Paul Pioneer Press|Pioneer Press]]|date=2012-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[A. O. Scott]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' called the short a "charming 3-D cartoon" that is "witty and touching and marvelously concise".&lt;ref name="Scott-12/07"&gt;{{cite news|last=Scott|first=A.

It also upholds (more than the TV series itself) one of the golden rules of animation: no talking."&lt;ref name="Scott-12/07"/&gt; Tim Martain of ''[[The Mercury (Hobart)|The Mercury]]'' has also described the short as "touching".&lt;ref name=Martain&gt;{{cite news|last=Martain|first=Tim|title=Quite an ice touch|url=http://www.themercury.com.au/article/2012/06/30/341381_movie-reviews.html|accessdate=2012-07-13|newspaper=[[The Mercury (Hobart)|The Mercury]]|date=2012-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Boston Globe]]''{{'}}s Tom Russo thought the short was "a welcome throwback to the days when ''The Simpsons'' had more sentiment at its core, and wasn’t so much about the latest batch of newbie [[Ivy League]] writers taking their cues from ''[[Family Guy]]''."&lt;ref name=Russo&gt;{{cite news|last=Russo|first=Tom|title=Shivering their timbers in ‘Ice Age’|url=http://www.boston.com/ae/movies/2012/07/12/shivering-their-timbers-ice-age/ANBhs0NBdGp0zzlZ9vqIjL/story.html|accessdate=2012-07-13|newspaper=[[The Boston Globe]]|date=2012-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a joint review of the episode "[[Hardly Kirk-ing]]", Teresa Lopez of TV fanatic said "''The Longest Daycare'' was a beautiful piece of animation showcasing a tender story of hope in an otherwise bleak environment. I feel like the only time ''The Simpsons'' can really exercise some creativity and depth is in these shorts and during the show's opening sequence."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tvfanatic.com/2013/02/the-simpsons-review-hardly-laughing The Simpsons Review: Hardly Laughing]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Amateurhour.jpg|right|thumb|250px|1950 trade advertisement]]
'''''The Original Amateur Hour''''' is an American [[radio]] and [[television]] program. The show was a continuation of ''[[Major Bowes Amateur Hour]]'' which had been a [[old-time radio|radio]] staple from 1934 to 1945. [[Edward Bowes|Major Edward Bowes]], the originator of the program and its master of ceremonies, left the show in 1945 and died the following year.  He was ultimately succeeded by [[Ted Mack (radio-TV host)|Ted Mack]], when the show was brought into television in 1948.

The show is a progenitor of later, similar programs such as ''[[Star Search]]'', ''[[American Idol]]'' and ''[[America's Got Talent]]''.

== Format and notable contestants ==
The format was almost always the same. At the beginning of the show, the talent's order of appearance was determined by spinning a wheel. After it was announced how many episodes the current one marked (the final broadcast on CBS being the 1,651st), the wheel was spun. As the wheel spun, the words "Round and round she goes, and where she stops nobody knows" were always intoned.  (From the late 1950s forward, the wheel was gone: it was symbolized by flute arpeggios as Ted Mack invoked the traditional phrase.)

Various acts, sometimes singers or other musicians, quite often [[vaudeville]] fare such as jugglers, tap dancers, baton twirlers, and the like, would perform, with the audience being asked to vote for their favorites by postcard or telephone. The telephone number JUdson 6-7000 was on a banner at the bottom of the screen for viewers to call.

As the show gained markets outside New York, Mack would give the address ("Box 191 Radio City Station") where viewers could send their postcards; he did this after every act. The winners were invited to appear on the next week's show. Three-time winners were eligible for the annual championship, with the grand-prize winner receiving a $2000 scholarship.

Ted Mack ensured that the show was very fast-paced. Despite the program's title, it was generally only a half-hour show, the only exception to this rule being from March 1956 to June 1957 on ABC, when it was expanded to an hour.

Some contestants became minor celebrities at the time, but few ever became really big show-business stars. The two greatest successes of the show's television era were [[Gladys Knight]], then only a child, and [[Pat Boone]]. Boone's appearances on the show probably caused the closest thing that it ever had to a scandal. After he had appeared, and won, for several weeks, it was revealed that he had appeared on the rival [[CBS Television]] show ''[[Arthur Godfrey's Talent Scouts]]'', meaning that he was technically not an "amateur" singer. He was removed from the program, but by then his fame was assured. At twenty-three, Boone was hosting his own variety show on ABC, ''[[The Pat Boone Chevy Showroom]]'', which aired from 1957–1960.

Other future celebrities discovered on the show include [[Ann-Margret]] (in 1958), [[Jose Feliciano]] (in 1962), [[Irene Cara]] (in 1967) and [[Tanya Tucker]] (in 1969). [[Louis Farrakhan]] appeared in 1949 playing a violin, under his real name Louis Wolcott. Future [[child actor]] [[Roger Mobley]] appeared with an older brother and older sister in a musical trio. The greatest fame attained by anyone appearing on the show was that achieved by [[Frank Sinatra]], who appeared on the show during its radio days with "The Hoboken Four".

During [[World War II]], some in the American armed forces believed that someone involved with the program was a [[Nazism|Nazi]] sympathizer because after many episodes aired, an American naval vessel would supposedly be sunk. The claim was that  coded information was passed out in the course of the broadcast. Some accused Bowes himself, but none of these accusations could ever be proved. Bowes was one of President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]'s closest friends and was personally responsible for having the swimming pool constructed at the [[White House]] when FDR was in office. As the years went by, the audience for this program aged as well. The Sunday -afternoon version of the series, which aired on CBS in the 1960s, was invariably sponsored by [[Geritol]] and other [[patent medicine]]s manufactured by their long-time sponsor, the [[Geritol|J. B. Williams Company]].

== History ==
=== Radio years ===
Bowes started the radio show on [[WEPN (AM)#WHN|WHN]] in [[New York City]] in 1934. Bowes' field assistant was [[Ted Mack (radio-TV host)|Ted Mack]], who scouted and auditioned talent for the program. Mack brought the show back in 1948 on [[Citadel Media|ABC Radio]], where it ran until 1952. When Mack assumed the host duties, his position in the field was taken by Albert Fisher.

The official archives of ''The Original Amateur Hour'' and the rights to the original programs and related material are now owned by Fisher. Fisher has donated the radio recordings and television films and tapes to the [[Library of Congress]], and has compiled a DVD collection of highlights from the series.

=== Television debut (1948–1954) ===
The television debut came on January 18, 1948 on the [[DuMont Television Network]] with Mack as the host. The regular staff for the television show included Lou Goldberg (aka Lewis Graham); Lloyd Marx, musical director; accompanist Dotty Marx, his wife; Jack Hoins, writer/producer; and Marguerite (Dwyer) Scheid, talent scout. The show regularly traveled to other cities across the United States and made at least two trips to Europe for the [[USO]]. In the early 1950s, the show went to Washington, D.C., for a memorable benefit featuring contestants from Congress and the [[Truman administration]].

The series is one of only six shows—the others were ''[[The Arthur Murray Party]]''; ''[[Down You Go]]''; ''[[The Ernie Kovacs Show]]''; ''[[Pantomime Quiz]]''; and ''[[Tom Corbett, Space Cadet]]''—to appear on all four TV networks during the [[Golden Age of Television]]. The series was broadcast weekly, on early Sunday evenings, on DuMont until September 25, 1949, then moved to [[NBC television|NBC Television]] in October 1949 where it remained until September 1952. NBC then hosted it from April 1953 to September 1954.

''The Original Amateur Hour'' finished at #27 in the [[Nielsen ratings]] for the 1950–1951 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.classictvhits.com/tvratings/index.htm|title=ClassicTVHits.com: TV Ratings|website=www.classictvhits.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Move to other networks (1955–1970) ===
The show moved to [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] (October 1955 to June 1957), then returned to NBC (July 1957 to October 1958). It then ran from May 1959 to October 1959 on [[Columbia Broadcasting System|CBS]], before returning to ABC for a last prime-time run from March 1960 to September 26, 1960. Even then the show wasn't finished—it ran for another decade as a late-Sunday-afternoon feature on CBS, beginning on October 2, 1960.

[[Rural purge|Many long-running CBS shows were canceled in 1970–71 because they attracted viewers of an advanced age]]. However, Ted Mack beat CBS to the punch and terminated the ''Original Amateur Hour'' of his own volition. The final show was broadcast on September 27, 1970.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/faidfrquery/F?faidfr:1:./temp/~faid_Fedx::|title=Library of Congress Amateur Hour Collection|website=loc.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Revival on The Family Channel (1992) ===
In 1992 Albert Fisher revived the program (as ''The New Original Amateur Hour'') on [[cable television]]'s Family Channel (now ABC) hosted by weatherman [[Willard Scott]]. This revival lasted one season, in spite of its popularity and high ratings. This show started television talent competitions &amp; is the reason for shows today like America’s Got Talent and American Idol.

It featured the debut of highly successful and famous Backstreet Boy [[Nick Carter (musician)|Nick Carter]]. This was a catalyst for other child stars including Elizabeth Byler who starred In October Sky, Earnest Goes to Camp, Other Voices Other Rooms and Summer Pulley who went on to become a member of the Disney Channels Mickey Mouse Club, a cast member of Nickelodeon’s Clarissa Explains It All and star in the movie Parenthood with Steve Martin. The show also revived the practice of counting the number of the original episodes, with the first being show number 1,652 and the last, show number 1,664.

'''''The Spell''''' is a 1977 American [[Television film|made-for-television]] [[horror film|horror]]/[[Drama (film and television)|drama film]] which premiered on [[NBC]] as "The Big Event" Movie of the Week. It is directed by [[Lee Philips]] and stars [[Lee Grant]], Susan Myers, [[Lelia Goldoni]] and [[Helen Hunt]]. It touches on the subject of [[telekinesis]] and follows the story of an adolescent girl who seeks revenge on those who ridicule her, while her mother tries to bring an end to her evil acts. It has gained a reputation as being an imitation of the 1976 classic [[Brian De Palma]] film ''[[Carrie (1976 film)|Carrie]]'' as several similarities are present, while it has fallen somewhat under the radar over the years and is seen as a "forgotten film".

==Plot==
Rita Matchett is a shy 15-year-old girl often picked upon for being overweight. One day in particular in her high school gym, Rita is teased by her classmates, in which she attempts to defend herself. While the girls take turns at rope climbing, Rita, struggling to climb, is opposite Jackie Segall, one of her snooty classmates. Jackie climbs to the top and begins to show off in front of the other girls by doing spins. Rita's stare becomes fixated on Jackie which causes her to fall of the rope and break her neck, killing her in the process.

Rita comes from a wealthy family and her home life is unhappy. She is neither close with her father, Glenn, nor her younger sister, Kristina, who view her as fat and unattractive, and often criticize her for her looks. Her mother, Marilyn, tries to maintain a balance in the home and is constantly upset by how Rita is treated and the rivalry between her daughters. Marilyn becomes furious with Rita when her attitude begins to change. However, she grows more concerned when Rita shows signs of abnormal behavior and starts speaking in chant, following an argument.

It later becomes evident that Rita is dabbling in something dangerous as a number of "accidents" seem to occur; Glenn is almost injured in a hit-and-run incident but is unharmed, while Marilyn's friend, Kathleen, having been ill for sometime, suddenly dies due to [[spontaneous combustion]] and Kristina almost drowns in a swimming pool. Marilyn is initially not convinced that Rita is behind these attacks, but Kristina confirms her suspicions when she reveals to Marilyn that Rita has been visiting Jo Standish, the school gym teacher, and they chant together. Rita had threatened Kristina to keep quiet about it.

Glenn informs Rita that he will be leaving home to attend a private school London, much to her disapproval, resulting in her to act aggressively. Marilyn sends Glenn and Kristina away for the night so that she can spend time with Rita. That evening, Marilyn follows Rita to Jo's house where she watches in secret as the two discuss the recent events and discovers that Jo caused the accidents so that Rita could seek revenge. When Jo tells Rita that their power will extent to a new community, Rita becomes upset as she believes that she will no longer be different and unique if others were to be like her. In the disagreement, the two begin to chant, and with her new powerful strength, Rita forces Jo to the ground. Back at home, Marilyn confronts Rita and begins to chant which violently forces Rita to be thrown around the room, while Marilyn tells her that it is over and if Rita insists on hurting her father and sister that she will destroy her. It is revealed that Marilyn also has power as Rita tries to retaliate and the two begin to constantly chant until Marilyn overpowers Rita, bring it all to an end. Marilyn comforts a sobbing Rita telling her that it is all over.

==Production==
''The Spell'' went into production stages in the mid 1970s, when writer Brian Taggert developed the script and pitched it to [[Columbia Pictures]], where he intended the film to receive a theatrical release. Columbia was impressed with Taggert's writing and his take on the theme of telekinesis. However, the film was slow to get off the ground and during the pre-production process, [[Brian De Palma]]'s similarly themed ''[[Carrie (1976 film)|Carrie]]'' became acclaimed and widely successful, which resulted in the film being converted into a teleplay for a network television [[Television film|Movie of the Week]]. Taggert claimed that he completed his script for the film while [[Stephen King]] was writing ''Carrie''. Both films open with a similar scene in which the character, Rita, in ''The Spell'', is teased and picked on by her classmates, which is how ''Carrie'' opened. As ''The Spell'' premiered on NBC three months following the release of ''Carrie'', it was seen as an imitation.&lt;ref name="The Spell g"&gt;{{cite av media|title=Interview with Writer Brian Taggert|publisher=Shout Factory|year=2017|medium=Documentary|format=Blu-ray}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The Spell f"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.blu-ray.com/movies/The-Spell-Blu-ray/180519/#Review| title=A CARRIE Wannabe| publisher=Blu-ray.com| date=18 December 2017| accessdate=26 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Release==
===Premiere===
''The Spell'' was broadcast on NBC on February 20, 1977 at 8:00 pm.&lt;ref name="The Spell d" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.ultimate70s.com/seventies_history/19770220/television| title=Prime-time network TV listings for Sunday February 20, 1977| publisher=Ultimate70s.com| accessdate=4 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reception===
The film has received mixed reviews from critics.

In an early review from [[Harriet Van Horne]] from [[New York (magazine)|New York Magazine]], she said that "you will shudder at ''The Spell'', giggle in the wrong places, and, NBC hopes, and stay tuned in to learn all about telekinesis." Of actress Lee Grant, she stated, "Grant is too fine an actress for this sort of TV trash".&lt;ref name="The Spell d"&gt;Van Horne, Harriet{{cite web| url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=aeMCAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA63&amp;lpg=PA63&amp;dq=james+olson+the+spell&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Ic0heVzNEB&amp;sig=Nb-0kT7ciJwcQV6_PO103z8-1Js&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjYzorMoenaAhUvUt8KHZEaBOsQ6AEwC3oECAAQYQ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false| title=Out of the Frying Pan and into the Mire| publisher=Books.google.com (New York Magazine archive)| date=21 February 1977| accessdate=3 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an online review for The Terror Trap, it was said of the film that "overall, a little slow at times but not bad".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.terrortrap.com/reviewsdatabase/s/spell.php| title=The Spell (1977)| publisher=Theterrortrap.com| accessdate=3 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; When reviewed for The Horror Honeys website, it was stated of the film that "It's not the perfect revenge film, but it ''is'' an interesting snapshot of the era and there are far worse ways to kill an evening".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.thehorrorhoneys.com/2013/11/what-if-carrie-was-kind-of-dick.html| title=What If Carrie Was Kind of a Dick?| publisher=Thehorrorhoneys.com| accessdate=3 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chris Hartley of The Video Graveyard mentions that "''The Spell'' is pretty forgettable stuff. When taken for what it is, it's not a complete waste of time and does have some unintentional chuckles and solid performances propping it up, but it's also just another forgotten 70s TV flick."&lt;ref&gt;Hartley, Chris{{cite web| url=http://www.thevideograveyard.com/s/spell.html|title=The Spell| publisher=Thevideograveyard.com| date=10 June 2013|accessdate=3 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film has been reviewed in several blog posts; in a 2009 blog post for Final Girl, Stacie Ponder said that "This is a made-for-TV effort that's fairly tame even for its time period" and "It's little more than a pleasant 70-minute diversion".&lt;ref&gt;Ponder, Stacie{{cite web| url=http://www.finalgirl.rocks/2009/10/day-18-nothing-is-forgotten.html?m=1| title=Day 18: Nothing is forgotten| publisher=Finalgirl.rocks| date=18 October 2009| accessdate=3 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jeffery Berg of the jdbrecords commented that "it's pretty preposterous, kind of boring, and sometimes hilarious."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://dbrecords.blogspot.com/2012/10/under-your-spell.html?m=1| title=under your spell| publisher=jdbrecords.blogspot.com| date=5 October 2012| accessdate=3 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; When it film was reviewed in a blog post for Horror Movie a Day, it was said that "even as a TV Movie this thing is shockingly dull throughout."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://horror-movie-a-day.blogspot.com/2013/03/the-spell.html| title=The Spell (1977)| publisher=Horror-movie-a-day.blogspot.com| date=14 March 2013| accessdate=3 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Similarities to ''Carrie''==
With the telekinesis theme becoming increasingly popular following the release of Brian De Palma's ''Carrie'', an adaptation of Stephen King's [[Carrie (novel)|1974 novel]], many films attempted to recreate this theme, with little success; ''The Spell'' was the first to do so and although claimed that the script with written prior to King's novel,&lt;ref name="The Spell g" /&gt; many similarities appear in ''The Spell'' including the opening scene in which the character, Rita, is bullied by her classmates, family issues, and telekinetic revenge. In the final scene in the film, which concerns the showdown between Rita and her mother, Marilyn, Rita uses her power to hurl knives at Marilyn; although missing her aim, it is much like the ending to ''Carrie'' in which Carrie kills her mother by launching flying knives through the air. Many films which have been considered imitations followed this, some of which include, ''[[Jennifer (1978 film)|Jennifer]]'' (1978), ''[[Patrick (1978 film)|Patrick]]'' (1978), ''[[Evilspeak]]'' (1982), and to a lesser extent, ''[[Laserblast]]'' (1978).&lt;ref&gt;Muir, John Kenneth{{cite web| url=https://flashbak.com/compared-to-this-carrie-was-an-angel-five-unforgettable-carrie-knock-offs-25373| title=Compared to this, Carrie was an Angel: 5 Unforgettable Carrie Knock-Offs| publisher=Flashbak.com| date=12 November 2014| accessdate=4 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other films with a similar theme include ''[[The Fury (1978 film)|The Fury]]'' (1978) and ''[[Firestarter (film)|Firestarter]]'' (1984).

'''''The Warriors''''' is a [[beat 'em up]] [[video game]], developed by [[Rockstar Toronto]] and published by [[Rockstar Games]]. It was released on October 17, 2005 for [[PlayStation 2]],  [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]] and was later released for [[PlayStation Portable]].  
''The Warriors'' is based on the [[The Warriors (film)|1979 movie of the same name]] (which in turn, is based on the [[The Warriors (Sol Yurick novel)|1965 novel of the same name]]), and features large scale brawling in 3D environments interspersed with other activities such as chase sequences.&lt;ref name="warriors"&gt;Navarro, Alex, [http://uk.gamespot.com/ps2/action/warriors/review.html The Warriors Review] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090428182637/http://uk.gamespot.com/ps2/action/warriors/review.html |date=2009-04-28 }}, ''GameSpot'', Oct 21, 2005, Accessed Mar 22, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

The console versions of the game were developed at [[Rockstar Toronto]], while the PSP port was developed by [[Rockstar Leeds]]. The game was first released on PS2 and Xbox on October 17, 2005 in the United States and October 21, 2005 in Europe. The original Xbox version featured 720p resolution; marking the first Rockstar game with HD graphics for home consoles. The game was then released on the [[PlayStation 3]] on May 28, 2013 in the United States and May 29, 2013 in Europe via the [[PlayStation Network]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.rockstargames.com/newswire/article/50051/the-warriors-coming-next-week-to-psn.html | title = The Warriors Coming Next Week to the PSN | publisher = Rockstar Games | date = 2013-05-23 | accessdate = 2013-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The game was released on the [[PlayStation 4]] on July 5, 2016 in the United States and Europe via the PlayStation Network.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/07/05/rockstars-the-warriors-is-out-now-for-ps4|title=Rockstar's The Warriors Is Out Now for PS4|last=Skrebels|first=By Joe|website=IGN|access-date=2016-07-06|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160705132342/http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/07/05/rockstars-the-warriors-is-out-now-for-ps4|archivedate=2016-07-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, due to licensing restrictions, as of 2016 several songs on the soundtrack have been removed from both the PlayStation 3 and PlayStation 4 versions of The Warriors, including [[Fear (band)|Fear's]] "[[I Love Livin' in the City]], and [[Joe Walsh|Joe Walsh's]] [[In the City (Joe Walsh song)|"In the City"]] from the [[The Warriors (soundtrack)|original film's soundtrack]].

The game takes place in gritty 1970s [[New York City]]. The story follows a street gang known as the Warriors, who have been accused of a murder they didn't commit, and must return to their home turf in one night, although the game begins three months prior to the film's events. The actors from the film itself reprised their roles to perform the voices of their original characters.&lt;ref name="Voice actor"&gt;[https://m.imdb.com/title/tt0486048/fullcredits/cast "Full Cast &amp; Crew: The Warriors (2005 Video Game)"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305185101/http://m.imdb.com/title/tt0486048/fullcredits/cast |date=2016-03-05 }} ''[[Internet Movie Database]]''. Retrieved on 24 December 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Upon its release, ''The Warriors'' received a positive critical response.

==Gameplay==
''The Warriors'' is an action-adventure, survival game which focuses heavily on brawling. Like most games from Rockstar Games, several minor gameplay elements are mixed into the experience, such as the ability to use spray paint to mark turf or to insult other people. The [[playable character]]s are the Warriors leader Cleon, Cleon's lieutenant Swan, heavy muscles Ajax and Snow, Cleon and Swan's friends Vermin and Cowboy, the scout Fox, [[Harlem]] native Cochise, and Rembrandt, the Warriors [[graffiti artist]].&lt;ref name="warrior review"&gt;Navarro, Alex [http://www.gamespot.com/the-warriors/.hmtl "The Warriors delivers as a completely stand-alone work, and any fan of beat-'em-up games is certain to enjoy it on some level."]. ''[[GameSpot]]''. (2013-12-24).&lt;/ref&gt; Cleon, Swan, Ajax, and Rembrandt are the most heavily featured characters.&lt;ref name="PSP review"&gt;McCullough, Tim. (2007-06-23). [http://worthplaying.com/article/2007/6/23/reviews/42995/.html "PSP Review - 'The Warriors'"]. ''Worthplaying''. (2013-12-24).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PSP review"/&gt; An arcade game called ''Armies of the Night'' is unlocked after you complete the main storyline of the game. The playable characters are Swan and Ajax.

In this prequel segment, The Warriors' headquarters serves as a hub.&lt;ref name="Pfister"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.1up.com/do/reviewPage?cId=3144844 | title = The Warriors PS2 Review | publisher = [[1UP.com]] | first = Andrew | last = Pfister | date = 2005-10-18 | accessdate = 2008-08-05 }}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=Ost316 |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; From inside, you can train (10 ranks of physical fitness such as, sit-ups, press ups, chin ups, and heavy bag, that increase your stamina), talk to fellow gang members, play through rumble mode and other bonus material, walk outside to Coney Island for extra missions, or begin the next level of the story proper.&lt;ref name="Pfister"/&gt; The player is presented with mission objectives such as beating up a certain number of enemy gang members or stealing a certain amount of items, with more complex and creative tasks like winning a graffiti competition in [[SoHo]], stealing goods to plant on crooked cops and rival gang members, and wild chases away from baseball bat wielding members of the Baseball Furies. Fighting takes the form of gang rumble style action with the player being assisted by other Warriors at the same time (a minimum of 1 and a maximum of 8). Combos are performed with 2-3 button chains for weak attacks, strong attacks, holds and throws. Grab attacks can be used for the playable character to perform their own unique power attack that will quickly decrease the enemy's health.&lt;ref name="Pfister"/&gt; The game sees the Warriors fight their way through the ranks, building a heavy rep and getting their colors out in force, until they get an invite to a meeting of all of the gangs of [[New York City]], which is where the movie (and the last few missions of the game) begins.&lt;ref name="Pfister"/&gt;

The game progresses linearly from one mission event to the next, usually presented as a [[cutscene]]. Combat in ''The Warriors'' occurs in real time and involves pressing buttons to initiate attacks by the on-screen character. By pausing the game, the player can find combat techniques ― 2-3 combos, wall smash, grab and throws, charges, body cross attack, snap attacks, weapon attacks, and counter-attacks.&lt;ref name="warrior review"/&gt; The player can also look at the character's stats.&lt;ref name="stats"&gt;[http://lparchive.org/The-Warriors/.html "Warriors!

The playable character has a bar below their feet to determine their health level, reducing whenever the character takes damage, although it can be replenished by using flash. The circular grey bar inside the health bar represents the player's grappling stamina, draining upon grabbing or mounting an opponent. The top-left hand side represents the character rage meter, which, when filled, allows the player to pull off a variety of combos and styles. In rage, the player will become temporarily invincible, using finishing moves and inflicting serious damage on the opponent. The player's allies, if they are knocked out, the player can use flash to replenish their health. However, if the playable character loses all of their health, the mission ends and the player will be prompted to resume from the checkpoint or restart the mission from the beginning. Defeating enemies will cause items to fall from their bodies; flash to restore health; spray to spray over enemy gang territories; and money which can be used to purchase items from dealers.

===Character development===
The player can choose to help other people in Coney Island. In return for helping these people, the Warriors will learn new abilities, such as defeating policemen to receive cuffs to subdue and arrest anybody, cuff-keys that will allow the player to free Warriors with keys instead of breaking cuffs, escape from cuffs themselves with cuff-keys, increase flash capacity, and earn brass knuckles and steel-toed boots to inflict more damage to the enemy.&lt;ref name="review4tw"&gt;[http://www.warriorsmovie.co.uk/tie-ins/video-games/review.html "Review of ''The Warriors''"]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}.

==Synopsis==

===Setting===
During ''The Warriors'', there are a collection of levels, referred to as missions, which the player must progress through. Eighteen can be accessed, along with six more bonus missions, known as "[[Flashback (narrative)|Flashbacks]]", which show how the Warriors were formed, and how each member of the Warriors came to join the gang,&lt;ref name="rates"&gt;[http://www.mobygames.com/game/ps2/warriors "The Warriors"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130315053253/http://www.mobygames.com/game/ps2/warriors |date=2013-03-15 }}.

However, throughout the game, the player travels to other areas of [[New York City]] visiting other gangs' territories in the process. Completing the missions/game allows the player to replay levels, to improve on the player's score, and unlock new characters, and a game mode called Fury Mode where you play as the Baseball Furies.&lt;ref name="nextlevel"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;(2005-11-16).

The design and casting of the characters was very faithful to what was seen in ''[[The Warriors (film)|The Warriors]]''. Each character is still portrayed as their respective role from the film ― Cyrus, the Riffs leader, inhabits Van Cortlandt Park, where the meeting took place. Luther, the Rogues leader, is based out of his [[hearse]], The Baseball Furies' territory is Riverside Park, The Lizzies' their apartment, with other smaller gangs based around the city. When starting a mission, the Warriors will occasionally stay at their home turf or travel to another place via [[train]] to use as a starting point.&lt;ref name="instruction"&gt;[[Rockstar Games]]. (2005). ''The Warriors Instruction Booklet''. Rockstar Games., Limited.&lt;/ref&gt;

Missions and events normally begin at the Coney Island headquarters, which is also used as a launching point throughout the game (except after the meeting), and the player can also travel to places all across [[New York City]], including [[Tremont, Bronx|Tremont]] where the Warriors encounters the Orphans, a low-class gang, and also Riverside Park which is run by the Baseball Furies, a well-respected gang. The main players travel from one turf to another all across New York, to let the public radio station know there is a new gang in town.&lt;ref name="rates"/&gt; This sometimes results in the Warriors brawling with the rival gangs.&lt;ref name="instruction"/&gt; The Warriors' hangout features a machine resembling a [[pinball table]], the "Rumble Mode" which upon completion of missions, unlocks special stages where the player can fight all of the gangs in [[New York City]].&lt;ref name="game"&gt;[http://www.giantbomb.com/the-warriors/3030-16206/html.

===Characters===
The primary [[protagonist]] is Cleon, the Warriors leader in the first half of the game until after the meeting. Cleon's role was to increase the Warriors reputation and rid [[Coney Island]] of the Destroyers.&lt;ref&gt;'''Cleon:''' Virgil's gone way too far this time! We're going to war tonight! I want all the Destroyers stomped out. Now they know we're coming and Virgil's gonna be holed up in the hangout. If we bop right in there, we're gonna get wasted. We're gonna have to-- / '''Vermin:''' Bullshit! I'll kill 'em all! /.../ '''Cleon:''' Vermin! / '''Vermin:''' But, Warlord, they killed Ash! They-- / '''Cleon:''' Listen to me! We gotta use our heads! We gonna have to draw them out! Take 'em down bit by bit! Everyone split up into warparties. Divide and conquer! Take out everything they got! Gambling, pimping, and their stores! They won't have no choice but to send out their soldiers. It's time to end these fools! Let's do it! {{cite video game| title = The Warriors| developer = Rockstar Toronto| publisher = Rockstar Games| date = 2013-12-24| platform Playstation 2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The major protagonist is Swan, the second-in-command throughout most of the game, covering the film itself.&lt;ref name="instruction"/&gt; Swan's role was to bring the Warriors back to Coney Island from the meeting where they were set up as the murderers of Cyrus.&lt;ref&gt;'''Swan:''' We're going back. If this truce is off, anything could hit us between here and that train. If you get separated, make it back to the platform at Union Square. {{cite video game| title = The Warriors| developer = Rockstar Toronto| publisher = Rockstar Games| date = 2013-12-24| platform Playstation 2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The other Warriors feature an important role with each Warrior having a role, like the heavy muscle Ajax and Snow,&lt;ref name="instruction"/&gt; Vermin is the bread man, which means he is the one who carries the money, Cowboy keeps track of The Warriors inventory, although this is only mentioned in the film.&lt;ref name="instruction"/&gt; Fox is the scout who goes ahead of The Warriors, warning them if trouble is ahead,&lt;ref name="instruction"/&gt; [[Harlem]] native Cochise is the watchman who watches their back when walking in a group, Snow is the radio man, which is also only established in the film.&lt;ref name="instruction"/&gt; and Rembrandt is The Warriors' [[graffiti artist]].&lt;ref name="instruction"/&gt;

Mercy serves as Swan's [[love interest]] in the second half of ''The Warriors''.&lt;ref name="Voice actor"/&gt; The primary [[antagonist]] is Luther, the Rogues leader, responsible for Cyrus' murder and framing the Warriors for the crime.&lt;ref&gt;Hayes, Britt.

Other areas contain other gangs of New York City, which the player must defeat in a battle. On one occasion, gang members tend to be scouts that appear in orange dots on the radar in different areas and spaces.&lt;ref name="instruction"/&gt; Upon being spotted by the gang member, the scout will call for backup, and the orange circles up the radar ― the player can then choose either to attack or stealth kill the scout.&lt;ref name="rates"/&gt; Policemen will appear as blue dots on the radar; if the player commits a crime, the blue circles up the radar, the blue dots will flash and the crime that is committed will appear on the middle screen, prompting the officers to chase and attempt to handcuff the player―&lt;ref name="nextlevel"/&gt;&lt;ref name="rates"/&gt; the player can also assault the officers or sneak into a hide area if no-one can see the player at the time.&lt;ref name="instruction"/&gt; Civilians in local places will rat the player out to a gang member or the police when committing a crime that disturbs their inhabitants.

Throughout the Warriors endeavours, they will be aided by Flash, Spray, and Knife dealers, to help them out ― Flash dealers are there to supply the player with flash, the game's equivalent of health packs, which costs 20 dollars, Spray dealers supply the player with spray paint, which costs 5 dollars, while Knife Dealers supply the player with knives, which cost 50 dollars. However, some of the dealers tend to defraud the player and make a run for it, but the player can chase them down to recover their money. However, if the player chooses to attack the dealers, they will either retaliate or run, though they will respawn.&lt;ref name="instruction"/&gt; In "Rumble Mode", playable characters can also be other gangs that have been unlocked in the game, to compete against other gangs in a match of one's choosing.&lt;ref name="game"/&gt;

==Missions==
In the story mode of the game, there are a total of 18 missions. Missions 1-13 take place three months before the meeting and missions 14-18 cover the movie itself. The player can only control one specific character in each mission, while the others are computer-controlled. The main Warriors that are controlled by the player are Cleon, Swan, Rembrandt, Ajax, Cowboy and Cochise. The only Warrior to not have a full playable mission to themselves is Snow; the only time players assume control of him is in the second half of mission 6 Writers Block, also Fox doesn't have a mission where he leads a War party. Along with the main missions, there are 5 bonus missions called "Flashbacks", which tell how the Warriors started and how each member joined. During each mission, the Warriors will meet and face off with other gangs in New York. In most missions, they will take the [[rapid transit|subway train]] to the other gang's turf. Although they are featured and mentioned in the game, the Electric Eliminators, the Panzers and the Van Cortlandt Rangers are the only gangs that the Warriors do not meet. The Destroyers are the only gang that are not featured in the film. Completing each mission unlocks gangs, arenas and mini-games.

===Warchief commands===
During each mission, there are 6 commands that the Warchief can issue out to his fellow Warriors.

* Wreck 'Em All - The Warriors focus their efforts on attacking and getting weapons.
* Mayhem - The Warriors smash anything in sight.
* Let's Go - The Warriors follow their Warchief.
* Scatter - The Warriors separate and hide from cops or enemy gangs.
* Watch My Back - The soldiers defend their Warchief. 
* Hold Up - The Warriors stop and defend their ground.

==Plot==
The game follows the plot of the film ''[[The Warriors (film)|The Warriors]]'', focusing on a [[Coney Island]] street gang the Warriors.&lt;ref name="instruction"/&gt; Led by Cleon ninety-days prior, the Warriors dispose their long time rival gang the Destroyers after Virgil, the Destroyers leader and former friend of Cleon is defeated. Their reputation increases by humiliating a low-rank gang the Orphans, killing Chatterbox leader of the Hi-Hats, spraying on trains, allying with the Saracens and set up their rivals the Jones Street Boys, and [[corrupt]] [[NYPD]] officers. Meanwhile, Cyrus, leader of the Gramercy Riffs, the most powerful gang in [[New York City]] plans a meeting to unite the gangs as one.

On the night of the meeting in [[Van Cortlandt Park]], Cyrus proposes to the assembled crowd a permanent citywide [[truce]] that would allow the gangs to control the city. Everyone opens to Cyrus' idea, only the leader is fatally shot by the Rogues leader, Luther―in the dramatic chaos, the killer frames Cleon and the Warriors. The Riffs hold the Warriors responsible and beat down Cleon, leaving his fate ambiguous while the other Warriors escape. Swan, the Warriors "warchief" takes charge of the group and make their way home. Cyrus's death sends anger through the city and the Riffs call a hit on the Warriors on a radio DJ,&lt;ref&gt;'''Masai:''' There must be some word. I want them all. I want all the Warriors. I want them alive, if possible. If not, wasted. But I want them. Send the word. {{cite video game| title = The Warriors| developer = Rockstar Toronto| publisher = Rockstar Games| date = 2013-12-24| platform Playstation 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'''DJ:''' All right, now. For all you boppers out there in the big city, all you street people with an ear for the action, I've been asked to relay a request from the Gramercy Riffs. It's a special for the Warriors. That's that real live bunch from Coney. And I do mean the Warriors. Here's a hit with them in mind.{{cite video game| title = The Warriors| developer = Rockstar Toronto| publisher = Rockstar Games| date = 2013-12-24| platform Playstation 2}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the gang themselves remain unaware they are implicated in Cyrus' murder.

After the Turnbull AC's failure to kill the Warriors as they escape to board the train en route to Coney Island, the train is stopped by a fire on the tracks at [[Tremont, Bronx|Tremont]]. On foot, they re-encounter the Orphans―who the Warriors humiliated prior.&lt;ref&gt;'''DJ:''' Now for the latest word in the big city. Turning the break beats against the Judas Bunch, the Boppers danced back to retain their reign supreme in Harlem. Up in Riverside, the Baseball Furies continued their winning streak by knocking out some Jones Street Boys. In the minor leagues today, the Orphans report that they been making some major moves by knocking out the Warriors, that outfit from Coney. / '''Ash:''' This is bullshit, man! / '''West:''' We never even met those wimps! We oughta kick them in their lying mouths! / '''Cleon''': Yeah, you're right. We oughta. The rest of you dudes stay put. Me and Fox is taking the new blood out to see if they as tough as they talk. {{cite video game| title = The Warriors| developer = Rockstar Toronto| publisher = Rockstar Games| date = 2013-12-24| platform Playstation 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'''Sully:''' Listen good, you fucking pansies. It don't matter whether we rumbled or not. What the Orphans say goes! Heh! Who the streets gonna believe? A solid outfit like us, or some bush league rejects from the ass-end of Brooklyn? / '''Cleon:''' Hey, Sully, that's a fine-looking car you got going on! {{cite video game| title = The Warriors| developer = Rockstar Toronto| publisher = Rockstar Games| date = 2013-12-24| platform Playstation 2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Swan makes peace, and Orphans' leader Sully allows them to walk through their territory unharmed; his partner Mercy mocks him,&lt;ref&gt;'''Mercy:''' Hey, Sully, aren't these the guys who trashed your car? You just gonna let 'em army right through here any time they feel like it? Pretty soon, every gang in town is just gonna boogie right in; soldier right through. I'll tell you, some man you are. {{cite video game| title = The Warriors| developer = Rockstar Toronto| publisher = Rockstar Games| date = 2013-12-24| platform Playstation 2}}&lt;/ref&gt; instigating a confrontation. The Warriors use a [[molotov cocktail]], blowing up Sully's car and Mercy follows the Warriors.

Swan, Mercy and the Warriors arrive on the [[96th Street (IRT Broadway – Seventh Avenue Line)|96th Street and Broadway]] in [[Manhattan]], where they are detected by the police and separated. Three of them board a train to Union Square. As Mercy escapes, Fox struggles with a police officer, falls to the tracks and is killed by an oncoming train. Swan and the other three run outside, and are chased into [[Riverside Park (Manhattan)|Riverside Park]] by the Baseball Furies, where a fight ensues and the Warriors emerge victorious. After fighting, Ajax notices a lone woman in the park; he is sexually aggressive and is arrested when the woman is revealed to be an undercover cop.

In the meantime at [[14th Street - Union Square (New York City Subway)|Union Square]], Rembrandt, Vermin, and Cochise are [[seduced]] by an all-female gang the Lizzies, only to learn its a trap.&lt;ref&gt;'''Starr:''' So you're the famous Warriors. The guys that shot Cyrus! / '''Rembrandt:''' Shit, the chicks are packed! The chicks are packed! {{cite video game| title = The Warriors| developer = Rockstar Toronto| publisher = Rockstar Games| date = 2013-12-24| platform Playstation 2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The trio escape, learning the truth―that everyone believes they killed Cyrus. Swan meets with Mercy and travel to Union Square where they are stalked by the Punks but the pair reunite with the other Warriors and defeat the Punks later on in the toilets. The Riffs receive a tip-off from a gang member who attended the meeting and witnessed Luther shoot Cyrus dead.

The Warriors finally arrive at Coney Island, where the Rogues are waiting for them and decide to face them.

==Development==
Rockstar Games began working on ''The Warriors'' in 2002. The PlayStation 2 and Xbox versions of the game were developed by [[Rockstar Toronto]], who were previously known as [[Rockstar Canada]]. Promotion of the game was aided by its appearance at E3 2005.&lt;ref name="Pre-E3"&gt;Dunham, Jeremy. (2005-05-12). [http://uk.ign.com/articles/2005/05/12/pre-e3-2005-the-warriors-from-film-to-game "Pre-E3 2005: The Warriors: From Film to Game"]. [[IGN]]. (2013-12-24).&lt;/ref&gt;  The game was later ported to the [[PlayStation Portable]] platform, and developed by [[Rockstar Leeds]].&lt;ref name="The Warriors"&gt;Dunham, Jeremy. (2005-06-12). [http://uk.ign.com/articles/2005/07/13/the-warriors-4.html "See that guy over there? He's after you, and he's got some guys with him."]. IGN. Retrieved on (2013-12-24).&lt;/ref&gt; This was first announced in October 2006, and Rockstar Leeds worked with original developers Rockstar Toronto in order to make the port easier. A spokesperson had said "We have worked closely with Rockstar Toronto to maintain the extremely high standards they've set for this game," said Gordon Hall, President of Rockstar Leeds. "The PSP system allows us to deliver the experience in an entirely different way, while staying very faithful to the original source material and maintaining the high standards we set for ourselves as a developer."&lt;ref&gt;[http://ir.take2games.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=86428&amp;p=irol-newsArticle&amp;ID=917907&amp;highlight=html "TRockstar Games Announces The Warriors for the PSP(R) (PlayStation(R)Portable) System"]. ''The Warriors''. ''IR''. Retrieved on 24 December 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Promotion===
''The Warriors'' then began to look a lot like several of Rockstar's other projects such as ''[[Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas]]'', ''[[Manhunt (video game)|Manhunt]]'', and ''[[Red Dead Revolver]]''. The look and presentation are definitely familiar, despite coming from different production houses, each developer shares their toolsets and proprietary technologies with each other on a consistent basis&lt;ref name="Warrior"&gt;Dunham, Jeremy. (2005-05-12). [http://uk.ign.com/articles/2005/07/13/the-warriors-4.hmtl "The Warriors"]. [[IGN]]. (2013-12-24).&lt;/ref&gt; A combination of the company's biggest hits like ''State of Emergency and Manhunt'', ''The Warriors'' successfully mixed multi-character co-op brawling with stealth action.&lt;ref name="Hand-on"&gt;Dunham, Jeremy. (2007-01-23). [http://uk.ign.com/articles/2007/01/24/the-warriors-hands-on "The Warriors Hands-on"]. [[IGN]]. (2013-12-24).&lt;/ref&gt; Just as was the case on PlayStation 2, if there is anything that positively sticks out regarding how ''The Warriors'' plays, it's the surprising depth of its characters. All nine playable fighters, while similar, have their own unique selection of moves and strengths and offer slightly different takes on the same concept.&lt;ref name="Hand-on"/&gt; Due to the PlayStation Portable being a handheld platform, differences to gameplay came about as a result of the port, such as the control configuration receiving a drastic change.&lt;ref name="Hand-on"/&gt;

==Audio==
During the review, a spokesman had stated "the audio, on the other hand, is on the other side of the scale".&lt;ref name="warrior review"/&gt; Many of the original actors from the film have returned to voice their characters—at least, most of the ones that are "still alive". [[Michael Beck]], [[James Remar]], and [[Dorsey Wright]] once again were praised in their excellent performances (despite sounding quite a bit older than the 20-something characters they play), and the remaining voice cast delivers, too.&lt;ref name="warrior review"/&gt; The spokesman further explains "it helps that the dialogue is well written, but there's hardly a bad voice actor in the bunch; the one weird thing about the voice work, though, is that a lot of it is made up of lines directly from the film." It seems as though, in some situations, Rockstar might have been better off just taking audio directly from the film rather than rerecording it.&lt;ref name="warrior review"/&gt; Obviously, they'd want the voices to match, but there are situations in which they could have easily gotten away with it, and ultimately would've had a better piece of dialogue.&lt;ref name="warrior review"/&gt; The audio in this game is great. As the spokesperson further explained he said: "To begin with the voice acting for all characters in the game is very, very good. From all the main characters to plain NPCs, each and everyone is done amazingly. On the subject of sound effects in the game it's also very good. Every little thing makes a sound and does it well."&lt;ref&gt;(2005-10-31). [http://www.gamefaqs.com/xbox/926608-the-warriors/reviews/review-93599.html "A Surprisingly Great Game"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131225060926/http://www.gamefaqs.com/xbox/926608-the-warriors/reviews/review-93599.html |date=2013-12-25 }}. Gamefaqs. (2013-12-31).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Voice cast===
''The Warriors'' features voice actors for both the [[The Warriors (film)|1979 film]] and the game versions. The film and game version cast [[Michael Beck]] as Swan, the [[protagonist]] of ''The Warriors''. Other notable voice actors included returning actors, [[James Remar]] as Ajax, [[Deborah Van Valkenburgh]] as Mercy, [[Dorsey Wright]] as Cleon, [[Thomas G. Waites]] as Fox, and [[David Harris (American actor)|David Harris]] as Cochise.&lt;ref name="Voice actor"/&gt; A special effort was made to preserve the official voice actors of characters from ''The Warriors'' movie used in the game itself.

While the movie version featured [[David Patrick Kelly]] as Luther, [[Roger Hill (actor)|Roger Hill]] as Cyrus, and [[Marcelino Sánchez]] as Rembrandt,&lt;ref&gt;[[Lawrence Gordon (producer)|Gordon, Lawrence]]; [[Walter Hill (director)|Hill, Walter]] (1979-02-09) [[The Warriors (film)|The Warriors00]]. ''The Warriors''. Retrieved on 29 December 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; the game version featured [[Oliver Wyman (actor)|Oliver Wyman]] as Luther, Andy Senor as Rembrandt, [[Joe Lo Truglio]] as Vermin, [[Michael Potts (actor)|Michael Potts]] as Cyrus, and Kurt Bauccio as Cowboy.&lt;ref name="Voice actor"/&gt; Supporting characters involves [[Darryl McDaniels]] and [[Jordan Gelber]].&lt;ref name="Voice actor"/&gt;

==Reception==
Upon its release, ''The Warriors'' received critical acclaim from critics. Many praised the game for its deep combat and control, stating that the game helped breathe life into the brawler genre. The game was also praised for its unique seedy underbelly style, along with its story and music. Critics praised the audio as it "really shines above all else", with a replicated soundtrack and absolutely superb voice acting by many of the original actors who starred in the film. Rockstar Toronto has gained the most media coverage for its development of ''The Warriors'', which overall received positive reviews,&lt;ref name="rockstar"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-2/the-warriors | title = The Warriors for PlayStation 2 Reviews, Ratings, Credits, and More at Metacritic | publisher = [[Metacritic]] | accessdate = 2010-11-28 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100829082806/http://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-2/the-warriors | archivedate = 2010-08-29 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; and made about $37 million worldwide. "Like the best of Rockstar’s games, 'The Warriors' immerses you in a world that feels at once authentic and highly stylized, and it might just be the best game adaptation of a film ever in terms of capturing the mood of the original movie."&lt;ref name="Helgeson"/&gt; 1UP admitted "As fanservice, The Warriors is a treat for anyone who loves the movie, and as a beat-em-up, it outclasses recent efforts from competitors. Yet as a complete package, it's somewhat inconsistent. But with bonus missions, multiplayer rumbles, and a very fun 2-player co-op mode...we can most definitely dig it".&lt;ref name="Pfister"/&gt; ''The Warriors'' received a score of 7.4 for the design, the story received 8.5, while the gameplay received 7.9.&lt;ref&gt;(2007-02-26).

}}
''[[Game Informer]]'' praised the feel and style of the game, stating "''The Warriors'' immerses you in a world that feels at once authentic and highly stylized, and it might just be the best game adaptation of a film ever in terms of capturing the mood of the original movie. Fans will notice that all of the iconic scenes of the film are recreated almost shot for shot. In addition, Rockstar Toronto has gone to the trouble of creating a completely new storyline that shows players how the Warriors came together, and the events leading up to the start of the film."&lt;ref name="Helgeson"/&gt; The reviewer went on to applaud the developers, saying they "Tried to stretch the conventional formula for what's considered a "brawler". Unlike most of the genre, where you walk down single-path alleyways, The Warriors, taking cues from other popular Rockstar titles, creates the illusion that you’re in a real, living city.&lt;ref name="Helgeson"/&gt;

Although, sizewise, the levels are much closer to ''[[Manhunt (video game)|Manhunt]]'' than ''[[Grand Theft Auto]]'', there are areas to explore both on the ground and vertically, hidden items, amazing unlockables, and numerous side missions. They’ve also tried to expand the gameplay to incorporate more than just fisticuffs.&lt;ref name="Helgeson"/&gt; You can engage in all sorts of petty crime, including muggings, stealing car stereos, lockpicking, and tagging graffiti. Throw in a little more variety in the form of some cool chase and stealth sequences, and you've got something more than a typical brawler."&lt;ref name="Helgeson"/&gt;

As ''Game Informer'' further explained, they stated "The fighting engine itself is fairly deep, allowing you to pull off some very brutal moves with a modicum of button presses (including some cool co-op maneuvers). You’ll definitely feel cool kicking ass as a Warrior, whether hand-to-hand or with any of the numerous weapons. However, I found the feel of the combat to be sluggish and chaotic at times, especially when fighting large numbers of enemies.&lt;ref name="Helgeson"/&gt; He recommended that "turning on the option that makes it stay in split-screen, but even that is hampered by your very narrow field of vision."&lt;ref name="Helgeson"/&gt; Critics enjoyed the graffiti writing, which is done through an "ingenious mechanic". He stated "Although it’s certainly not a masterpiece, The Warriors gets by on style, flair, variety, and simple fun. The gameplay – while still enjoyable – isn’t nearly as polished as it could be, the story and the appeal of the world that The Warriors recreates will be enough to pull you through to the end."&lt;ref name="Helgeson"/&gt;

==Lawsuit==
In 2006, [[Roger Hill (actor)|Roger Hill]], who also played Cyrus in the movie, filed a lawsuit of [[United States dollar|USD]]$250,000 (${{inflation|US|250,000|2006|r=2|fmt=c}} when adjusted for inflation) against [[Take-Two]] for using his voice and [[depiction]] in the game without his permission. He claimed that it would not have been difficult for Take-Two to pay, since the game made $37 million (${{inflation|US|37,000,000|2006|r=2|fmt=c}} when adjusted for inflation).&lt;ref name="Jenkins"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=9867 | title = Gamasutra - Take-Two Sued By The Warriors Actor | publisher = [[Gamasutra]] | first = David | last = Jenkins | date = 2006-06-27 | accessdate = 2008-04-20 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110605121140/http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=9867 | archivedate = 2011-06-05 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Update inline|date=August 2016}}

==Other media and cancelled sequel==
A spiritual sequel was planned by Rockstar, which was to be unrelated to ''The Warriors''. The game was to be titled ''We Are The Mods'' and was to be set in 1960s England during the [[mods and rockers]] brawls.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/5792730/rockstar-had-planned-a-spiritual-successor-to-the-warriors|title=Rockstar Had Planned a ‘Spiritual Successor’ to The Warriors|publisher=[[Kotaku]]|date=2011-04-16|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110518035333/http://kotaku.com/5792730/rockstar-had-planned-a-spiritual-successor-to-the-warriors|archivedate=2011-05-18|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, later in 2009, an arcade game was released entitled ''[[The Warriors: Street Brawl]]'' which is a [[beat 'em up]] scroller [[video game]] created by CXTM and released on [[Xbox Live Arcade]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Warriors: Street Brawl Tech Info|url=http://uk.gamespot.com/the-warriors-street-brawl/techinfo/|publisher=uk.gamespot.com|accessdate=24 August 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130824180304/http://uk.gamespot.com/the-warriors-street-brawl/techinfo/|archivedate=24 August 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dabel Brothers Productions]] in 2009, began a five issue comic book adaption of the film.

'''Anthony Howard "Tony" Wilson''' (20 February 1950 &amp;ndash; 10 August 2007) was a British [[record label]] owner, radio and television presenter, [[nightclub]] manager, [[impresario]] and journalist for [[Granada Television]] and the [[BBC]].

Wilson was the man behind some of [[Manchester]]'s most successful [[List of bands from Manchester|bands]]. He was one of the five co-founders of [[Factory Records]] and the founder and manager of [[the Haçienda]] nightclub. Wilson was known as "Mr Manchester",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2007/08/11/nwilson111.xml|title='Mr Manchester' Tony Wilson dies|date=11 August 2007|accessdate=17 January 2010|work=The Daily Telegraph|author= Malkin, Bonnie|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/manchester/6941716.stm|title=Tributes paid to 'Mr Manchester'|date=11 August 2007|accessdate=17 January 2010|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; dubbed as such for his work in promoting the [[culture of Manchester]] throughout his career.

He was portrayed by [[Steve Coogan]] in [[Michael Winterbottom]]'s 2002 film ''[[24 Hour Party People]]'', and by [[Craig Parkinson]] in [[Anton Corbijn]]'s 2007 film ''[[Control (2007 film)|Control]]''.

==Early life==
Wilson was born 20 February 1950 in [[Salford Royal NHS Foundation Trust|Hope Hospital]] in the Hope area of [[Pendleton, Greater Manchester|Pendleton]], [[County Borough of Salford|Salford 6]], Lancashire, to Sydney Wilson and Doris Knupfer, and moved to [[Marple, Greater Manchester|Marple]], near [[Stockport]] in [[Cheshire]], at the age of five.&lt;!---Note to editors, we use the county of the time----&gt;&lt;ref name="Manc online"&gt;{{cite news|author=Taylor, Paul|url=http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/s/1013/1013299_wilson_put_city_on_the_map.html|title=Wilson put city on the map|work=Manchester Evening News|accessdate=17 January 2010|date=10 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; His maternal grandfather was a Jewish German immigrant. After passing his [[Eleven plus exam]], Wilson attended De La Salle Grammar School in Weaste Lane, [[Pendleton, Greater Manchester|Pendleton]], Salford. He developed a love of literature and language, ignited by a performance of ''[[Hamlet]]'' at [[Stratford upon Avon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.theguardian.com/obituaries/story/0,,2147392,00.html

==Broadcasting career==
[[Image:Tony Wilson hosting After Dark - Easter 1991.jpg|thumb|upright| ''[[After Dark (TV series)|After Dark]]'' during Easter 1991]]
After his graduation in 1971, Wilson began as a trainee news reporter for [[ITN]], before moving to Manchester in 1973, where he secured a post at [[Granada Television]]. He went on to present Granada's culture, music and events programme, [[So It Goes (TV series)|''So It Goes'']]. Through the 1970s and 1980s he was one of the main anchors on ''[[Granada Reports]]'', a regional evening news programme, where he worked with [[Richard and Judy]] among others. He continued in this line of work even at the height of his success in the music industry.

He reported for [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]]'s celebrated current affairs series, ''[[World in Action]]'' in the early 1980s and from 1987 hosted ''[[After Dark (TV series)|After Dark]]'', the UK's first open-ended, late night chat show, in which he chaired live discussions in a darkened studio, first on [[Channel 4]] and later [[BBC4]]. In 1989, Wilson hosted ''The Other Side of Midnight'', another Granada weekly regional culture slot, covering music, literature and the arts in general. Wilson co-presented the BBC's coverage of ''[[The Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert]]'' at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]] with [[Lisa I'Anson]] in 1992. He hosted the short-lived TV quiz shows ''Topranko!'' and [[MTV Europe]]'s ''[[Remote Control (game show)|Remote Control]]'' in the 1990s, as well as the [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] themed quiz, ''Masterfan'', for [[Manchester United TV|MUTV]].

In 2006 he became the regional political presenter for the [[BBC]]'s ''[[The Politics Show]]''. He presented a weekly radio show on [[Xfm Manchester]] – ''Sunday Roast'' – and a show on [[BBC Radio Manchester]]. In October he joined Blur bassist [[Alex James (musician)|Alex James]], [[Blue Peter]] presenter [[Konnie Huq]] and previously unknown presenter Emily Rose to host the 21st century version of the iconic 1980s music programme, "The Tube", for [[Channel 4 Radio]] which ran until 2 March 2007. His final music TV show was filmed in December 2006 for Manchester's [[Channel M]]. Only one episode, entitled 'The New Friday', was recorded before Wilson became ill.

==Music career==

Wilson's involvement in popular music stemmed from hosting Granada's culture and music programme [[So It Goes (TV series)|"''So It Goes''"]]. Wilson, who intensely disliked the music scene of the mid-1970s which was dominated by such genres as [[progressive rock]] and [[arena rock]], saw the [[Sex Pistols]] at Manchester's [[Free Trade Hall|Lesser Free Trade Hall]], in June 1976, an experience which he described as "nothing short of an epiphany".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Sean O'Hagan |url=http://film.guardian.co.uk/interview/interviewpages/0,6737,661059,00.html |title=Guardian interview on the release of 24 Hour Party People |publisher=Film.guardian.co.uk |date= 3 April 2002|accessdate=25 October 2010 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; He booked them for the last episode of the first series, probably the first television showing of their revolutionary British strand of [[punk rock]].

He was the manager of many bands, including [[A Certain Ratio]] and [[the Durutti Column]], and was part owner and manager of [[Factory Records]], home of [[Happy Mondays]], [[Joy Division]] and [[New Order (band)|New Order]] – the band managed by friend and business partner [[Rob Gretton]]. He also founded and managed [[the Haçienda]] nightclub and Dry Bar, together forming a central part of the music and cultural scene of Manchester. The scene was termed "[[Madchester]]" in the late 1980s and early 1990s.

He made little money from Factory Records or the Haçienda, despite the enormous popularity and cultural significance of both endeavours.&lt;ref&gt;[http://musicians.about.com/b/2008/08/06/tony-wilson.htm About.com Music Careers: Tony Wilson] Retrieved on 9 August 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Both Factory Records and the Haçienda came to an abrupt end in the late 1990s.

A semi-fictionalised version of his life and of the surrounding era was made into the 2002 film, ''[[24 Hour Party People]]'', which stars [[Steve Coogan]] as Wilson. After the film was produced, Wilson wrote a novelisation based on the screenplay. He played a minor role (playing himself) in the 2005 film, ''[[A Cock and Bull Story]]'', in which his character interviews Steve Coogan. Wilson also co-produced the 2007 [[Ian Curtis]] biopic, ''[[Control (2007 film)|Control]]'' (his character this time being played by [[Craig Parkinson]]). He died a few months before its release.

Wilson was a partner in the annual 'In the City'&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2008/oct/09/in.the.city.festival|title=Tony Wilson's spirit lives on at In the City|last=Martin|first=Daniel|date=9 October 2008|work=The Guardian|access-date=20 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 'Interactive City' &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/liverpool/capital_culture/2004/06/ic04/index.shtml|title=From Seaport to E-Port|last=O'Callaghan|first=Bren|date=9 June 2004|work=BBC|access-date=20 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;music festivals and industry conferences, and also F4 Records, the fourth version of Factory Records, which was set up to be an online distributor for Wilson's long term protégé [[Vini Reilly]], of the [[Durutti Column]].

==Politics==
Wilson identified himself as a socialist and refused to pay for private healthcare on principle.&lt;ref name="Friends fund Wilson's cancer drug"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/manchester/6293176.stm | work=BBC News | title=Friends fund Wilson's cancer drug | date=11 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wilson was also an outspoken supporter of [[Regional Assemblies in England|regionalism]].&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite news|url=http://www.liverpooldailypost.co.uk/liverpool-news/regional-news/2007/08/11/liverpool-tributes-to-tony-wilson-64375-19609563|title=Liverpool tributes to Tony Wilson|author=Shaughnessy, Jessica|date=11 August 2007|work=Liverpool Daily Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with others including [[Ruth Turner (political advisor)|Ruth Turner]], he started a campaign for [[North West England]] to be allowed a referendum on the creation of a regional assembly, called the "Necessary Group"&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.onetel.net.uk/~howardpaterson/business.htm Liverpool Links: Business] Retrieved on 9 August 2008 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080725075349/http://web.onetel.net.uk/~howardpaterson/business.htm |date=25 July 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; after a line in the [[United States Declaration of Independence]]. Although his campaign was successful, with the Government announcing that a vote would take place, this was later abandoned when [[North East England]] voted against the introduction of a regional tier of government. Wilson later spoke at several political events on this subject. He was also known for using [[Situationist International|Situationist]] ideas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://musicians.about.com/od/indielabels/p/factoryrecords.htm About.com: Factory Records Profile] Retrieved on 9 August 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Wilson's goal of a strong regional political settlement was eventually achieved in 2017, ten years after his death, with the election of a “Metro Mayor” for Greater Manchester and an equivalent for Merseyside.

==Relationships==
Wilson was married twice, first to Lindsay Reade and then to Hilary, with whom he had a son, Oliver, and a daughter, Isabel. In 1990 he started a relationship with Yvette Livesey, a former [[Miss England]] and [[Miss UK]], who was his girlfriend until his death in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1560130/Tony-Wilson.html|work=The Daily Telegraph|date=13 August 2007|title= Tony Wilson|accessdate=9 August 2008|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Livesey has since co-operated with a biography of Wilson's life, called ''You're Entitled to an Opinion&amp;nbsp;...'', written by [[David Nolan (British author)|David Nolan]] and published in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.citylife.co.uk/arts/literature/news/14017_nolan_s_truthful_tribute_to_tony|title=Nolan's truthful tribute to Tony|work=CityLife|author=Donohue, Simon|date=15 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Illness==
After Wilson developed [[renal cancer]] and had one kidney removed in 2007, doctors recommended he take the drug Sutent (a.k.a. [[sunitinib]]). Manchester Primary Care NHS Trust refused to fund the £3,500 per month cost of providing the drug, while patients being treated alongside him at the [[Christie Hospital]] and living just a few miles away in [[Cheshire]] did receive funding for the medication.&lt;ref name="Friends fund Wilson's cancer drug"/&gt;

A number of Wilson's music industry friends, including former [[Happy Mondays]] manager Nathan McGough, their current manager Elliot Rashman and TV stars Richard Madeley and Judy Finnegan, formed a fund to help pay for Wilson's medical treatment.&lt;ref name="Friends fund Wilson's cancer drug"/&gt;

Wilson said: "This [Sutent] is my only real option. It is not a cure but can hold the cancer back, so I will probably be on it until I die. When they said I would have to pay £3,500 for the drugs each month, I thought where am I going to find the money? I'm the one person in this industry who famously has never made any money. I used to say 'some people make money and some make history', which is very funny until you find you can't afford to keep yourself alive. I've never paid for private healthcare because I'm a socialist. Now I find you can get tummy tucks and cosmetic surgery on the NHS but not the drugs I need to stay alive. It is a scandal."&lt;ref name="Friends fund Wilson's cancer drug"/&gt;

==Death and legacy==
In early 2007 emergency surgery was performed to remove one of his kidneys.&lt;ref name="bbcobit"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/manchester/6941105.stm |title=Obituary: Tony Wilson |accessdate=10 August 2007 |date = 10 August 2007|work=BBC News }}&lt;/ref&gt; This forced the postponement of plans to create a [[Southern Hemisphere]] version of the In the City festival.&lt;ref name="Australian"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thewest.com.au/default.aspx?MenuID=25&amp;ContentID=20912 | title=Music showcase postponed after founder in surgery drama |accessdate=10 August 2007 | date=9 February 2007 | work=[[The West Australian]] |author= Collins, Simon |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070930023906/http://www.thewest.com.au/default.aspx?MenuID=25&amp;ContentID=20912 |archivedate = 30 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the surgery, the cancer progressed and a course of [[chemotherapy]] was not effective. Wilson died of a heart attack in Manchester's [[Christie Hospital]] on 10 August 2007 aged 57.&lt;ref name="MEN Obituary"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legacy.com/ManchesterEveningNews/DeathNotices.asp?Page=Lifestory&amp;PersonId=92426047 |title=Family Notices – Manchester Evening News |publisher=Legacy.com |date= |accessdate=25 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.side-line.com/news_comments.php?id=25201_0_2_0_C |title=Factory Records founder Anthony Wilson dies from cancer |publisher=Side-line.com |date= |accessdate=25 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the news of his death, the [[Union Flag]] on [[Manchester Town Hall]] was lowered to half mast as a mark of respect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/s/1013/1013356_wilson_extraordinary__yvette.html|title='Wilson extraordinary' – Yvette|work=Manchester Evening News|author=Crook, Amanda|date=13 August 2007|accessdate=15 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- Wilson's heart attack was not caused by his kidney cancer: only one early BBC article stated this and even that one appears to have been changed. Every other source quotes his doctor saying that the heart attack was unrelated to the cancer. --&gt;

Probate documents reveal his estate was valued at £484,747 after tax. That figure includes the value of his city centre flat on Little Peter Street. The will, signed by Wilson on 4 July 2007, gave Yvette Livesey, 39, his girlfriend of 17 years, the proceeds from their home. He also left her his share of six businesses. His son Oliver and daughter Isabel shared the rest of his estate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/s/1042126_tony_wilsons_will_revealed|title=Tony Wilson Will Revealed|accessdate=24 March 2008|author=Osuh, Chris|date=24 March 2008|work=Manchester Evening News}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
His funeral was at St Mary's RC Church, Mulberry Street, Manchester (The Hidden Gem) on 20 August 2007. As with everything else in the Factory empire, Tony Wilson's coffin was also given a [[Factory Records discography|Factory catalogue number]]: FAC 501.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lynskey|first=Dorian|title=A fitting headstone for Tony Wilson's grave|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/oct/26/fitting-headstone-tony-wilson-grave|newspaper=The Guardian|date=26 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is buried at [[Southern Cemetery, Manchester|Southern Cemetery]] in [[Chorlton-cum-Hardy]], Manchester.&lt;ref name="CR-headstone"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://creativereview.co.uk/cr-blog/2010/october/peter-saville-anthony-wilson-headstone|title=- Saville and Kelly's memorial to Tony Wilson|last=Burgoyne|first=Patrick|date=22 October 2010|accessdate=27 October 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120314081655/http://creativereview.co.uk/cr-blog/2010/october/peter-saville-anthony-wilson-headstone|archivedate=14 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; His black granite&lt;ref name="CR-headstone" /&gt; headstone, erected in October 2010,&lt;ref name="guardian-headstone"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/oct/26/fitting-headstone-tony-wilson-grave|title=A fitting headstone for Tony Wilson's grave|last=Lynskey|first=Dorian|date=26 October 2010|work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=27 October 2010|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; was designed by [[Peter Saville (graphic designer)|Peter Saville]] and [[Ben Kelly (designer)|Ben Kelly]]&lt;ref name="guardian-headstone" /&gt; and features a quotation, chosen by Wilson's family,&lt;ref name="CR-headstone" /&gt; from [[Isabella Banks|Mrs G Linnaeus Banks]]'s 1876 novel ''The Manchester Man'',&lt;ref name="CR-headstone" /&gt;&lt;ref name="guardian-headstone" /&gt; set in [[Rotis|Rotis serif]] font.&lt;ref name="CR-headstone" /&gt; The quotation reads: "Mutability is the epitaph of worlds/ Change alone is changeless/ People drop out of the history of a life as of a land though their work or their influence remains."&lt;ref name="CR-headstone" /&gt;

The main square of the [[HOME (Manchester)|HOME]]/First Street development in Manchester, which opened in 2015, is named Tony Wilson Place.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.placenorthwest.co.uk/news/archive/16700-first-street-honours-manchester-cultural-heritage.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Turboweekend''' is a [[Denmark|Danish]] [[synthesizer]] [[Rock music|rock]] band, formed in 2006 by the three childhood friends Martin Øhlers Petersen, Silas Bjerregaard and Morten Køie. Anders Stig Møller joined the live shows in 2009, and was made official member in 2011 during the recordings of their latest studio album Fault Lines.

== Early achievements and ''Night Shift'' (2006–2008) ==
Morten, Martin and Silas formed their first band in 8th grade and in the following years played together in several different constellations before forming Turboweekend in late 2005. "Into You" the band's first radio hit, was recorded in early 2006, and Turboweekend played their debut concert in April that year. During 2006 the band became increasingly popular at the [[Copenhagen]] [[Hipster (contemporary subculture)|hipster]] parties, and was eventually booked for [[Roskilde Festival 2007]]. The debut album ''[[Night Shift (Turboweekend album)|Night Shift]]'' was released October 1, 2007 on [[Copenhagen Records]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; In 2008 the band played at Danish radio award show "P3 Guld" and was nominated as ''Newcomer of the Year'' at both "P3 Guld" and "Zulu Awards". In mid-2008 the band started working on their second album Ghost Of A Chance.

== ''Ghost of a Chance'' and the ''Bound'' EP (2009–2011) ==
Turboweekend's second album ''[[Ghost of a Chance (Turboweekend album)|Ghost of a Chance]]'' was released March 23, 2009 on [[Mermaid Records]]/[[Sony Music]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://www.discogs.com/artist/Turboweekend Turboweekend Discography at Discogs&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; 
''Ghost of a Chance'' became the band's breakthrough record in their home country and nominated them for the main prize ''P3 Prisen'' at P3 Guld 2010. October 16, 2009, ''Ghost of a Chance'' was released in [[Germany]] and [[Switzerland]] and in 2010 in [[Poland]] on [[Sony Music]]. The first single "Trouble Is" reached number 1 on the German college radio playlist. In the spring of 2010 [[Dutch people|Dutch]] DJ [[Tiësto]]'s remix of "Trouble Is" was released worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tiestoblog.com/news/world-premiere-of-turboweekend-trouble-is-tiesto-remix/ World premiere of “Turboweekend – Trouble Is (Tiësto Remix)” | TIËSTOBLOG&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2010 the band played at [[Roskilde Festival 2010|Roskilde Festival]] again. At the same time "Trouble Is" hit number 1 on the Polish radio chart and at the end of the year it was the 8th most played track on the Polish radio station [[Eska Rock]].

On November 10, 2010 the band released the free EP ''[[Bound (Turboweekend album)|Bound]]'' via their webpage. Turboweekend was among the 5 nominees for [[MTV Europe Music Awards]] ''Best Danish Act'' at the show in Madrid in November 2010.

At P3 Guld on January 14, 2011 the band won the award ''P3 Breakthrough''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dr.dk/p3/temaer/p3-guld-2011 |accessdate=March 3, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101204144457/http://www.dr.dk/p3/temaer/p3-guld-2011 |archivedate=December 4, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The album ''[[Ghost of a Chance (Turboweekend album)|Ghost of a Chance]]'' was certified Gold in January 2011 in Denmark.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.presswire.dk/default.asp?o=1&amp;pid=45712 Turboweekend går guld&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; At the [[Danish Music Awards]] in November, Turboweekend won the award for ''Best Danish Live Act''. Keyboard player Anders Stig Møller, who previously only had been hired as a live musician, became a part of the band, as they started working on songs for what would become their 3rd full length studio album Fault Lines.

In February 2012, Turboweekend signed a deal with [[EMI|EMI Nordic]] (now [[Parlophone]]), for the release of their 3rd full length studio album Fault Lines. In Denmark the album went #1 in the week of its release and first single On My Side was elected Hit Of The Year (shared 1st place) by listener votes on national radio P3. 
In April the band went on a 24 date European tour through The Netherlands, Germany, Austria, Switzerland and Poland and in March they released the Shadow Sounds ep containing stripped down versions of 6 songs from previous releases, which the band had rearranged for a small mini-tour in February at a handful of intimate venues. The European tour in April was followed up by a couple of festival shows in Switzerland, The Czech Republic, Hungary and Germany, as well as gigs in Denmark at Skive, Nibe, Trailerpark and Skanderborg festivals. The band is currently working on their 4th studio album.
