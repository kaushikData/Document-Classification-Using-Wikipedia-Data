      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="47133">The '''2015 Iglesia ni Cristo leadership controversy''' is a dispute between senior  members of the [[Christian denomination]] [[Iglesia ni Cristo]] (INC) in the Philippines. In July 2015, it was reported that the INC had [[Excommunication|expelled]] some of its ministers, along with high-profile members Felix Nathaniel "Angel" and [[Cristina Villanueva Manalo|Cristina "Tenny" Manalo]]. Angel is the brother of current INC Executive Minister [[Eduardo Manalo]] and Tenny is the mother of Eduardo, and widow of former Executive Minister [[Eraño Manalo]].&lt;ref name=supporters&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gamil|first1=Jaymee|title=Supporters gather outside home of Manalo matriarch|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/707216/supporters-gather-outside-home-of-manalo-matriarch-son#ixzz3gjR4fqaK|accessdate=23 July 2015|publisher=Philippine Daily Inquirer|date=23 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Angel and Tenny were expelled from the INC for allegedly "sowing disunity" in the Church. The INC administration released a statement claiming that Eduardo had agreed to the expulsion of his brother and mother from the INC, as decided upon by its overall leadership.&lt;ref name=supporters/&gt; However, both Angel and Tenny claimed their lives were threatened by the Iglesia administration. Angel and Tenny had reportedly been illegally detained at the Iglesia's Central Office Complex in [[Tandang Sora]], [[Quezon City]], and that at least ten ministers of the Church were missing and alleged to have been abducted.&lt;ref name=coverup&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cayabyab|first1=Marc Jayson|title=Manalo kin held to cover up INC scam?|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/707184/manalo-kin-held-to-stop-them-from-exposing-inc-mess-minister|accessdate=23 July 2015|publisher=Philippine Daily Inquirer|date=23 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Former INC ministers Roel Rosal and Isaias Samson, Jr., claimed that the ''Sanggunián'' (the highest administrative council of the INC) had unlawfully abducted and detained ministers, along with members of the Manalo family, to cover up corruption surrounding the chief auditor, Glicerio "Jun" Santos, Jr.&lt;ref name=Inquirer6&gt;{{cite web|last1=Quismundo|first1=Tarra|title=SuspendedINC minister details detention|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/707291/suspended-inc-minister-details-detention|accessdate=23 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 24, 2015, INC, represented by Glicerio B.

==Overview==

===Angel and Tenny Manalo===
On July 22, 2015, a video was uploaded to [[YouTube]] featuring Felix Nathaniel "Angel" Manalo, the brother to nominal INC leader [[Eduardo V. Manalo]] and a former General Manager of GemNet (formerly the TV station of INC, replaced by [[INCTV]]), along with his mother, Cristina "Tenny" Manalo, the widow of Eraño Manalo.&lt;ref name=Youtube&gt;{{cite web|title=Bro EGM's family - Call for help|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSbDN7vEYdw|accessdate=23 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the video, they claimed their lives had been threatened by the Iglesia leadership, along with that of Angel's sister, [[Lottie Hemedez]]. Tenny Manalo also claimed that there had been a mass [[kidnapping]] of ministers who had not been accounted for, implying that their disappearance somehow traced to the INC leadership, and that she had not been able to speak to Eduardo V. Manalo.&lt;ref name=ABS-CBN&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/nation/07/23/15/iglesia-ni-cristo-expel-tenny-manalo-son-angel |title=Iglesia ni Cristo expels Tenny Manalo, son Angel |website=ABS-CBN News |date=1914-07-27 |accessdate=2015-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, INC denies the claims. Bienvenido Santiago, INC's chief evangelist, announced a few hours after the video's release that INC was expelling Cristina "Tenny" Manalo, along with Felix Nathaniel "Angel" Manalo, for allegedly causing divisions in the Church and wanting to seize power.&lt;ref name="Rappler"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Francisco |first1=Katerina  |first2=Chay F. |last2=Hofileña |url=http://www.rappler.com/nation/100225-iglesia-cristo-manalo-expel-mother-brother |title=Iglesia ni Cristo head expels mother, brother |work=[[Rappler]] |date=23 July 2015 |accessdate=23 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Santiago claimed that their video was a sympathy ploy to gather support to meddle in the leadership of the INC and that the INC administration was acting on the wishes of [[Eduardo V. Manalo]] to prevent discord in the Church. Edwil Zabala, a spokesman for the INC stated that the INC would consider having Tenny and Angel Manalo return to the Church if they would pledge to uphold and obey their teachings.&lt;ref name="Rappler 3"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Francisco|first1=Katerina|title=Iglesia ni Cristo head expels mother, brother|url=http://www.rappler.com/nation/100225-iglesia-cristo-manalo-expel-mother-brother|accessdate=23 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marco Eraño "Marc" Villanueva Manalo and Lolita "Lottie" Manalo Hemedez, the younger siblings of Eduardo and Angel, were also expelled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Iglesia Ni Cristo announces expulsion of Eduardo Manalo's mother, siblings|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/527206/news/nation/watch-iglesia-ni-cristo-announces-expulsion-of-eduardo-manalo-s-mother-siblings|accessdate=23 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the response from the INC, an unidentified individual was photographed holding a sign saying "''Tulong'', hostage ''kami''" ([[Tagalog language|Tagalog]]: ''Help, we're [held] hostage'') in a building that is part of the INC Central Office in Tandang Sora, Quezon City. An interview to Angel Manalo later confirmed that it was just a "playing child" who was the promotor of the sign and is nothing serious at all. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sign outside INC building: 'Tulong, hostage kami'|url=http://www.rappler.com/nation/100237-iglesia-cristo-help-hostage-sign|accessdate=23 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; When contacted by reporters, INC spokesman Edwil Zabala referred them to a CD recording of Santiago's statement regarding the expulsions.

In a press briefing that same afternoon, Santiago confirmed the expulsions. Santiago said in Tagalog, "Painful as it is to our brother Eduardo Manalo, they have decided to expel those who have been causing division within the Church. That is why in future worship services of the Church of Christ, from this day, the Overall Leadership will let this be known by all of our brothers".&lt;ref name="whereare"&gt;{{cite news | first1=Marc Jayson | last1=Cayabyab | url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/707189/where-are-the-missing-ministers | title=‘Where are the missing ministers?’ | publisher=Inquirer.net | date=23 July 2015 | accessdate=23 July 2015 | last2=Sauler | first2=Erika}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:JfCiudadINC9725PhilArenafvf 22.JPG|200px|thumbnail|Angel Manalo has criticized the Church's decision to build the [[Philippine Arena]] and suggested that funds used to build the sports venue could have been used to build more houses of worship.&lt;ref name=hitscorruption/&gt;]]

The [[Philippine National Police]], through its Quezon City Police District (QCPD), sent its personnel to the INC compound on July 23. They were able to contact Angel in the evening, and Angel himself talked to the reporters around 1:00 [[Philippine Standard Time|PST]], denying he was detained and saying that sign pleading for help was done by a child joking around. QCPD Joel Pagdilao said that the police is ruling out case of abduction and described the concerned persons inside as peaceful and free.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sabillo|first1=Kristine Angeli|title=Police to ensure safety amid INC dispute — Malacañang|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/707436/police-to-ensure-safety-amid-inc-dispute-malacanang|accessdate=24 July 2015|publisher=Inquirer.net|date=24 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Francisco|first1=Katerina|title=Cops rule out abduction in Iglesia compound|url=http://www.rappler.com/nation/100298-iglesia-cristo-police-tandang-sora-compound?cp_rap_source=ymlScrolly|accessdate=24 July 2015|publisher=Rappler|date=24 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Angel Manalo also spoke to the reporters and criticized the Church's Sanggunian, denied that he is challenging the leadership of his brother, [[Eduardo Manalo]]. He also advised his brother Eduardo against trusting people within the Sanggunian he alleged to be corrupt. He also criticized the decision's to build the [[Philippine Arena]] instead of more houses of worship. He lamented the situation that his Church is facing saying in Tagalog, "Why is it that these days, there are many anomalies? Others might say we're challenging our brother. No, we love our brother. But our problem is with people around him." He added "The doctrine of the Iglesia ni Cristo is now damaged. In the same way that you looked up to us before, now you can see there are many anomalies. There are many acts of corruption in the Church. That's what we want to avoid" &lt;ref name=hitscorruption&gt;{{cite news|last1=Francisco|first1=Katerina|title=Manalo brother hits Iglesia ni Cristo 'corruption'|url=http://www.rappler.com/nation/100304-manalo-brother-iglesia-cristo-corruption|accessdate=24 July 2015|publisher=Rappler|date=24 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 15, 2015, church guards prevented Manalo and his housekeepers from allowing members of the media to enter their ancestral house in Tandang Sora, following the inspection of the sheriff of the Quezon City RTC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/747894/angel-manalo-protests-illegal-fencing-off-of-inc-manalo-compound|title=Angel Manalo protests ‘illegal’ fencing off of Iglesia family compound|publisher=Philippine Daily Inquirer|last=Sauler|first=Erika|date=15 December 2015|accessdate=16 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The court inspection  was requested by church officials in order to identify the occupants of property, following reports that unknown masked and hooded persons were going in and out of the compound which is right beside the INC central office, as well as in response to several ex-Marines who tried to go inside the INC Compound, led by renegade soldier Capt. Nicanor Faeldon, and who were only stopped by INC security. INC spokesman Zabala also claimed that the #36 TS property was owned by INC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.journal.com.ph/news/top-stories/inc-cleared|title=INC cleared|publisher=Journal Online|last=Gutierrez|first=Paul M.|date=17 December 2015|accessdate=18 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Angel Manalo also protested the construction of the high fences in the compound.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.rappler.com/nation/116062-angel-manalo-eduardo-manalo-barriers-tandang-sora-residence|title=Angel Manalo to brother Eduardo: Stop building barriers in 36 Tandang Sora|publisher=Rappler|date=15 December 2015|accessdate=16 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next day, the Quezon City RTC branch 22 ordered INC to restore the electricity supply of the compound, remove and dismantle the blocking fences, and remove the guardhouse and portalet that blocked the vehicle gate #3 of the Manalo's home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rappler.com/nation/116116-court-iglesia-blockade-electricity-manalo-tandang-sora|title=Court to INC: Remove blockade, restore power at Tandang Sora|publisher=Rappler|last=Cepeda|first=Mara|date=17 December 2015|accessdate=17 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

INC planned to file an ejectment case against Manalo and Hemedez if the siblings refused to leave their residence in Tandang Sora.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://politics.com.ph/walang-kapatid-kapatid-inc-files-ejectment-case-vs-expelled-manalos/|title=Walang kapatid, kapatid: INC to file ejectment case vs. expelled Manalos|publisher=Politiko|date=January 15, 2016|accessdate=January 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On her part, Manalo-Hemedez said that she is the real owner of the #36 Tandang Sora compound, having been owned the property since 1983. She maintained that she and her household would not leave the compound.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rappler.com/nation/119209-lottie-iglesia-ni-cristo-erano-manalo|title=Lottie Manalo to Iglesia: We are heirs of 'God's Messenger'|publisher=''[[Rappler]]''|last=Francisco|first=Katarina|date=January 16, 2016|accessdate=March 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Presidential aspirant [[Roy Señeres]] visited the compound in January 2016. Guards barred Señeres from entering and refused to let him provide the occupants with food and bottled water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Señeres dinedma ng Manalo family|publisher=''Inquirer Bandera''|date=January 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ministers===
That same day, allegations from former and current INC ministers claimed that the Manalo family were hostages. Roel Rosal, a former Iglesia ni Cristo minister who stated that he and his wife were expelled from the church for trying to expose corruption,&lt;ref name=Inquirer4&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cayabyab|first1=Marc Jayson|title=Manalo kin held to cover up INC scam?|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/707184/manalo-kin-held-to-stop-them-from-exposing-inc-mess-minister#ixzz3ghmIkmLc|website=Inquirer.net|accessdate=23 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; made a public statement that ten ministers along with the Manalos were under house arrest at the INC Central Office, at the behest of INC auditor general Glicerio B. "Jun" Santos, Jr. in order to prevent the revelation of financial corruption by Santos and his staff. Rosal claims that Santos has pilfered and misused church offerings, and is holding the Manalos for "revenge."&lt;ref name=Inquirer2&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cayabyab|first1=Marc Jayson|title=Manalo kin held to cover up INC scam?|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/707184/manalo-kin-held-to-stop-them-from-exposing-inc-mess-minister#ixzz3ghmIkmLc|website=Inquirer|accessdate=23 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Supporters of Tenny and Angel Manalo gathered outside the compound demanding to know the whereabouts of the Manalos and missing ministers. [[GMA News and Public Affairs|GMA News]] reported that they saw an individual resembling Angel Manalo inside of the house, along with guards wielding long firearms.&lt;ref name=GMANews&gt;{{cite web|last1=Medina|first1=Andrei|title=Ka Angel, Ka Tenny’s supporters gather outside Manalo compound |url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/527318/news/nation/ka-angel-ka-tenny-s-supporters-gather-outside-manalo-compound |publisher=GMA News Online |accessdate=29 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Dasmariñas jf9441 13.JPG|thumbnail|[[Dasmariñas]] the city where INC minister Menorca was reported to have been arrested.]]
At least ten ministers are reported to be missing according to expelled minister Roel Rosal.&lt;ref name=coverup/&gt; One of the reported ministers, Lowell Menorca II was reported to be arrested by the [[Philippine National Police]] in [[Dasmariñas]] after two construction workers were allegedly threatened by Menorca with a grenade. Menorca's lawyer, Allen Blair Boy from the New Era University Legal Aid, questioned whether he was abducted and Boy said that Menorca told him that he was indeed arrested. It is not clear why he was in Dasmariñas, because Menorca is based in [[Sorsogon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Allegedly abducted Iglesia minister nabbed by Dasmariñas PNP|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/527330/news/nation/allegedly-abducted-iglesia-minister-nabbed-by-dasmarinas-pnp|accessdate=23 July 2015|publisher=GMA News|date=23 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 29, 2015, Rosal reiterated his claims against the INC leadership. He also stated that the Quezon City Police were taking sides in the conflict by supporting the INC administration, and denying Angel and Tenny Manalo deliveries of food and water. Rosal also claimed that the captives in the Manalo compound were running out of food and water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Araja|first1=Rio N.|title=QC cops hit for INC bias|url=http://manilastandardtoday.com/2015/07/29/qc-cops-hit-for-inc-bias/|website=Manila Standard|accessdate=30 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a press conference held July 23, INC minister Isaias Samson, Jr. cited Menorca's case alleging that the military had taken him from Sorsogon to Dasmariñas. He said that the missing ministers were held in Rosalia Compound and Caringal in Quezon City.&lt;ref name=govint/&gt;

Arnel Tumanan,&lt;ref name=supporters/&gt; Joven Sepillo of [[Tacloban]], and Nolan Olarte of [[Cebu]] are among the other reported missing ministers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Meruenas|first1=Mark|title=DOJ steps in, orders NBI to probe ‘abduction’ of Iglesia ni Cristo ministers|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/527722/news/nation/doj-steps-in-orders-nbi-to-probe-abduction-of-iglesia-ni-cristo-ministers|accessdate=24 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

INC, thru attorney Serafin Cuevas, Jr., had also filed [[libel]] charges against Samson and Joy Yuson, former administrative coordinator of GEM TV,  then the TV arm of INC, for accusing INC and its Sanggunian members of involvement in various anomalies and alleged abductions of ministers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Chavez|first1=Chito|title=INC files libel charges vs expelled minister|url=http://www.mb.com.ph/inc-files-libel-charges-vs-expelled-minister/|publisher=''Manila Bulletin''|accessdate=24 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; preliminary investigations for the said case started on September 16, 2015 at the Quezon City RTC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Francisco|first1=Katerina|title=Former Iglesia minister appears in court over libel complaint|url=http://www.rappler.com/nation/106102-iglesia-ni-cristo-isaias-samson-libel-preliminary-investigation|publisher=''Rappler''|accessdate=September 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Menorca released a video on October 23, 2015, a few days after he was allegedly rescued from abduction by the Sanggunian and the filing of writ of ''habeas corpus'' by his brother Anthony and sister-in-law Jungko Azuka. In it he supported the claim that he was abducted and illegally detained from July 25-October 21 in the Central Compound together with his wife, children  and housekeeper, and orchestrated by the Sanggunian. He further claimed that he and his family never asked to the Church to give them a house, or to be put into protective custody. The supposed rescue of the Menorca Family was first supported by attorney Trixie Cruz-Angeles, the lawyer of the INC's expelled ministers, including Jun Samson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/734041/ex-iglesia-ni-cristo-minister-lowell-menorca-confirms-abduction|title=Ex-Iglesia ni Cristo minister Lowell Menorca confirms abduction|publisher=Philippine Daily Inquirer|first=Yuji Vincent|last=Gonzales|date=2015-10-23|accessdate=2015-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the alleged illegal detention they claimed to have not been allowed to leave the premises nor had the right to accept guests. Cellphones and gadgets were also said to not be allowed in the premises. After the video was uploaded, INC expelled him and his family. The expulsion papers was signed by minister Radel Cortez.&lt;ref name=

===Isaias Samson, Jr.===
Isaias Samson, Jr., was a second-generation INC minister, former Sanggunian member and head of Foreign Department. He had been demoted due to some cases in his department to be an editor of INC's ''Pasugo'' magazine (a section of INC's Evangelism Department) and part of the Philippine government's Official Prayer Day and regular minister during prayers in SONA. He held a press conference on July 23 confirming his own detention, stating that he and his family were placed under house arrest by the INC administration, with the involvement of military and police officials. Samson stated that he was detained because of his opposition to Santos and gave a rough estimate of the amount of fund misused by Santos as in the "millions" of pesos, but he gave no evidence. Samson also stated that communication from the outside world was cut off and that passports, computers, phones and other electronic devices were confiscated. He was accused by INC leadership of being "Antonio Ebangelista," a pseudonym used by a minister who had written critical articles that reveal details on Church administration and Santos, a charge Samson denies. Samson and his family escaped by telling the guards they wanted to go to church service. Samson described his imprisonment as "unlawful detention," and called some in the INC administration "dishonest," but stated that he retained his faith in the INC.&lt;ref name="Inquirer6"/&gt; Samson later claimed corruption within the INC leadership regarding misuse of funds, such as in the "Lingap sa Mamamayan" fund, use of private planes and oil business. On July 25, 2015, INC spokesman Edwil Zabala stated that Samson and his family were expelled from the church for refusing to submit to authority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Former ‘Pasugo’ editor expelled from Iglesia Ni Cristo|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/527642/news/nation/former-pasugo-editor-expelled-from-iglesia-ni-cristo|accessdate=24 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Samson was replaced by Dennis C. Lovendino, a minister who became the new editor of ''Pasugo'' as of the June 2015 issue.

In a separate interview with [[CNN Philippines]], INC Spokesperson Zabala said that the so-called house arrest of the family of Samson, Jr. was a disciplinary act within the Church (preventive  suspension) in which Samson was under investigation, due to his connection to the group in social media that was claiming corruption issues inside the church.

In November 17, the Department of Justice dismissed the criminal raps filed by Samson and fellow expelled member Lito de Luna Fruto against the INC leaders for lack of [[probable cause]]. Both Samson and Fruto accused INC of holding them against their will.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/nation/11/17/15/doj-junks-criminal-raps-vs-iglesia-execs|title=DOJ junks criminal raps vs Iglesia execs|last=Reformina|first=Ina|publisher=ABS-CBN News|date=2015-11-17|accessdate=2015-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Investigations==
On July 24, 2015, the [[Department of Justice (Philippines)|Department of Justice]] ordered the [[National Bureau of Investigation (Philippines)|National Bureau of Investigation]] (NBI) to investigate allegations of abduction of INC members. However it added that it would not interfere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Francisco |first1=Katerina |title=DOJ orders probe into Iglesia ni Cristo 'abduction' |url=http://www.rappler.com/nation/100344-doj-probe-iglesia-cristo-abduction |accessdate=24 July 2015 |publisher=Rappler |date=24 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Loyola |first1=Jun |title=VIDEO &amp;#124; DOJ orders probe of INC 'detentions, abductions' but Angel Manalo snubs NBI team |url=http://www.interaksyon.com/article/114814/video--doj-orders-probe-of-inc-detentions-abductions-but-angel-manalo-snubs-nbi-team |accessdate=July 27, 2015 |publisher=News5 Interaksyon |date=July 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 27, 2015, in a statement by Manuel Eduarte, chief of the NBI Anti-Organized Transnational Crime Division, said that the NBI concluded that insufficient evidence showed that the Iglesia ni Cristo abducted some of its ministers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=NBI on Iglesia ni Cristo 'abduction': Case closed |url=http://www.rappler.com/nation/100695-nbi-iglesia-ni-cristo-abduction-case-closed |accessdate=27 July 2015 |publisher=Rappler |date=27 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, on July 29, 2015, Former Justice department secretary (now Senator) [[Leila de Lima]] clarified that the case had not been closed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Meruenas|first1=Mark|title=De Lima: NBI probe on Iglesia ni Cristo 'abduction' not yet closed|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/530630/news/nation/de-lima-nbi-probe-on-iglesia-ni-cristo-abduction-not-yet-closed|accessdate=7 August 2015|publisher=GMA News|date=29 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Former Vice President [[Jejomar Binay]] criticized de Lima's "unwarranted statements" asserting that the case remained open and noted her statement contradicts the reported findings of NBI Anti-Organized Transnational Crime Division. "By your actuations, you are promoting the image of disunity, discord and even corruption in the INC to its clear prejudice and detriment," Binay said that De Lima must respect the [[separation of church and state]] and "unwarranted interference" from the government in the church must not happen. Binay also describe De Lima's dealings with the Iglesia ni Cristo controversy as similar to what he describes as a "[[Character assassination|policy of demolition]]" targeted towards his own person.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=VP to de Lima: Stop meddling with INC|url=http://www.manilatimes.net/vp-to-de-lima-stop-meddling-with-inc/207132/|accessdate=7 August 2015|publisher=The Manila Times|date=6 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Protests in response to the investigation===
{{main article|2015 Iglesia ni Cristo protests}}
On late evening of August 27, about 2,000 Iglesia members led by INC spokesman Edwil Zabala held a vigil outside the [[Department of Justice (Philippines)|Department of Justice]] office and later moved to [[EDSA (road)|EDSA]]. The demonstrators protested against the government agency, led by De Lima, for allegedly persecuting their church and called for upholding the [[separation of church and state]]. They also called for the agency to prioritize more important issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Esmaquel|first1=Paterno II|title=Iglesia ni Cristo rallies flock: ‘Inaapi tayo!’|url=http://www.rappler.com/nation/104004-iglesia-ni-cristo-zabala-doj-rally-persecution|accessdate=28 August 2015|publisher=Rappler|date=28 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reactions==

===Iglesia ni Cristo===

====Religious leaders====
INC general evangelist Bienvenido Santiago on July 23, 2015, responding to allegations made by the Manalos in a July 22 video, dismissed the accusations that some INC ministers were abducted and claimed that the two were attacking the church to make it appear that it was involved in the abductions. He also added that the video was an attempt to rally support from church members and to distract the church's management. Santiago said that the church's decision to expel the two Manalos was to show that the INC is a religion that follows the teachings of God found in the Bible, not a business.&lt;ref name=whereare/&gt;

In a morning Sunday worship in July 26, INC executive minister Eduardo Manalo repeated that members should strictly follow the church's leadership and rules to attain salvation.&lt;ref name=pdievm&gt;{{cite news|last1=Reyes-Estrope|first1=Carmela|title=Manalo asks Iglesia ni Cristo members to follow church leadership|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/707847/manalo-asks-iglesia-ni-cristo-members-to-follow-church-leadership|accessdate=26 July 2015|publisher=Inquirer Central Luzon|date=26 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The media reported that an INC member said that provincial ministers issued a set of ''tagubilin'' (instructions) towards the church's members during the weekend ahead of the church's 101st anniversary celebrations to be held in July 26 in [[Ciudad de Victoria]] complex in [[Bulacan]]. Among these reported instructions were that members decline media inquiries and travel by private cars to the celebrations. During the centennial celebrations, members were provided with service vehicles. Stickers for vehicles with "One with EVM" were reportedly distributed.&lt;ref name=pdievm2&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cinco|first1=Maricar|title=Iglesia ni Cristo members told: carry ‘EVM’ tarps; shun media interviews|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/707823/inc-members-told-carry-evm-tarps-shun-media-interviews|accessdate=26 July 2015|publisher=Inquirer Southern Luzon|date=26 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The media reported an unusually high number of worshipers and vehicles at the INC church in [[Los Baños, Laguna|Los Baños]]. Several taurpalins bearing the words "One with EVM" were posted outside the building.&lt;ref name=pdievm2/&gt;

====Expelled members====
Expelled INC minister Roel and his spouse, Shirley Rosal told reporters on July 23, 2015 that at least 10 ministers were under [[house arrest]]. Roel Rosal claimed that auditor Jun Santos and his staff were using donations for the INC to purchase [[luxury car|luxury vehicles]]. He also said that Angel and Tenny Manalo were hostages. Roel said that the expulsion of the Manalos might have been influenced by a "third party" in the church administration.&lt;ref name=supporters/&gt;&lt;ref name=coverup/&gt;

Isaias Samson, Jr. at a July 23 press conference, said that government intervention in the crisis would help resolve the issue.&lt;ref name=govint&gt;{{cite news|last1=Torres-Tupas|first1=Tetch|title=INC crisis: Suspended minister urges gov’t intervention|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/707267/inc-crisis-suspended-minister-urges-govt-intervention|accessdate=23 July 2015|publisher=Inquirer.net|date=23 July 2015|language=English, Tagalog}}&lt;/ref&gt; Samson was expelled from the INC the day after his press conference.

====Other members and supporters====
Fewer than 12 supporters of the church wearing white armbands organized a vigil in support of the Manalos in front of the INC compound in Tandang Sora.&lt;ref name=supporters/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Francisco|first1=Katerina|title=Frustrated INC members back leader's kin|url=http://www.rappler.com/nation/100257-inc-members-manalo-house-rally?cp_rap_source=ymlScrolly#cxrecs_s|accessdate=24 July 2015|publisher=Rappler|date=23 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2:00 am of July 25, no INC member was seen camping outside the compound.&lt;ref name=novigil&gt;{{cite news|last1=Yee|first1=Jovic|title=No vigil outside Angel Manalo’s residence|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/707548/no-vigil-outside-angel-manalos-residence|accessdate=25 July 2015|publisher=Philippine Daily Inquirer|date=25 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some members used social media to express their support for Eduardo V. Manalo and the Sanggunian. Some members changed their profile photo to an image bearing the words  "I am one with EVM," in support of the leadership of Eduardo Manalo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Mateo|first1=Janvic|title=Iglesia rift widens online|url=http://www.philstar.com/headlines/2015/07/26/1481030/iglesia-rift-widens-online|accessdate=26 July 2015|publisher=The Philippine Star|date=26 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 25, 2015, Louie Cayabyab, the minister of the Iglesia ni Cristo locale in [[Fremont, California]], resigned his position as minister as a response to the expulsions of Samson and Tenny and Angel Manalo. Cayabyab stated "Beloved brethren, there are two circulars that are supposed to be read this morning. The first circular is about the expulsion from the Church of the wife and children of Bro. Erano G. Manalo. And another circular is the expulsion from the Church of Bro. Isaias T. Samson Jr., former editor-in-chief of the ''Pasugo''. I decided, brethren, that I won’t read those circulars. You might be asking, 'why?' Because in my heart, in my heart of hearts, I can’t take it. It is, it is just so so difficult to betray one’s heart..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/528746/news/nation/iglesia-ni-cristo-minister-in-california-quits-post |title=Iglesia ni Cristo minister in California quits post &amp;#124; News &amp;#124; GMA News Online |website=Gmanetwork.com |date= |accessdate=2015-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Cayabyab asked INC members to remain in the church, he urged them to support peaceful vigils held in their areas, and implored them to support brethren in the Philippines "who are risking their lives" to expose corruption and reform the church.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Esmaquel|first1=Paterno|title=US-based INC minister: 'Never my intention to quit'|url=http://www.rappler.com/nation/100595-iglesia-ni-cristo-minister-louie-cayabyab-quit|accessdate=27 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to Cayabyab's resignation, members of the INC in [[Northern California]], numbering in the "dozens," according to [[ABS-CBN News]], held a protest at the INC's main United States office in [[Burlingame, California]], demanding an investigation and tribunal into the corruption allegations, along with the reinstatement of Angel and Tenny Manalo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Surprising move: Iglesia ni Cristo members in California hold protest|url=http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/global-filipino/07/27/15/surprising-move-iglesia-ni-cristo-members-california-hold-protest|accessdate=27 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; About a week later those who were identified as having taken part in the protests were expelled from the church.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Conclara|first1=Rommel|title=INC expels members who joined protest in US|url=http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/global-filipino/08/06/15/inc-expels-members-who-joined-protest-us|accessdate=7 August 2015|agency=ABS-CBN North America News Bureau|publisher=ABS-CBN News|date=6 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Members of INC from 26 ecclesiastical districts picketed the Department of Justice office in [[Manila]], when Secretary Leila de Lima, on her birthday, officially announced her 2016 senatorial bid. The assembly happened a few days after former minister Samson, Jr., his wife and son, filed illegal detention charges against eight members of the Sanggunian. A respondent of the case, Bienvenido Santiago, Sr., the church's general evangelist, wanted De Lima to focus instead on the SAF 44 case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Iglesia Ni Cristo Press Statement as read during Aug. 26 press conference|url=http://www.eaglenews.ph/iglesia-ni-cristo-press-statement-as-read-during-aug-26-press-conference/|accessdate=August 27, 2015|publisher=Eagle News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Iglesia ni Cristo members: ‘Why, why, why, De Lima?’

====Net 25 TV interview with allegedly missing ministers====
In an interview with Eagle News Service/Net 25 on July 29, 2015, a broadcaster owned and operated by INC affiliate [[Eagle Broadcasting Corporation]], ministers Lowell "Boyet" Menorca II, Joel San Pedro, Jojo Nemis and Arnel Tumanan denied they were held captive or tortured. They also affirmed their loyalty to the church administration and executive minister [[Eduardo Manalo]] and that they were still church members. The ministers also stated that members should not believe the claims of abduction.&lt;ref name="Eagle News"&gt;{{cite web|title=INC ministers come out in the open to say they were not abducted, hit lies spread in media|url=http://www.eaglenews.ph/inc-ministers-come-out-in-the-open-to-say-they-were-not-abducted-hit-lies-spread-in-media/|website=Eagle News|accessdate=30 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Anthony Menorca, Boyet Menorca's brother, stated that his older brother was forced to deny his abduction because INC Sanggunian was holding Boyet Menorca's wife, Seiko Otsuka Menorca, and one year old child. Anthony stated that in a meeting with his brother, he told him "Binantaan kami ng kapatid ko na kami ay papatayin" ([[Tagalog language|Tagalog]]: ''"My brother warned us we will be killed"'') Anthony Menorca stated that he was in an undisclosed location and feared for the life of his brother.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cepeda|first1=Mara|title=Sibling of ‘abducted’ minister to INC Council: Free my brother|url=http://www.rappler.com/nation/101041-inc-lowell-menorca-brother-abduction|website=Rappler|accessdate=30 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a new video released after he was allegedly rescued from the captivity of the Sanggunian on October 21, Menorca clarified, claiming that everything he said in the interview on Net 25 were "scripted".&lt;ref name=
"Rappler 1"/&gt;

====Interview with Boyet Menorca====
On August 1, 2015, Boyet Menorca, along with his wife and child, were interviewed in person outside the INC compound, wherein he denied all allegations of his abduction and pleaded for his brother to stop making claims. He added that he and his family voluntarily decided to stay within the compound because of safety concerns. He was worried that he could potentially be attacked in order to direct the resulting blame on the INC. After the interview, he and his family returned to the INC compound.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/531300/news/nation/iglesia-minister-lowell-menorca-ii-denies-church-holding-his-family-against-their-will|title=Iglesia minister Lowell Menorca II denies church holding his family against their will|date=3 August 2015|website=gmanetwork|accessdate=29 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, Menorca stated the interview was held "under duress."&lt;ref name="rappler1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rappler.com/nation/110561-lowell-menorca-iglesia-ni-cristo-abduction-story |title=Ex-minister Lowell Menorca recounts Iglesia 'detention' ordeal |website=Rappler.com |date= |accessdate=2015-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Menorca recounts capture and being held hostage====
On October 21, 2015, Lowell Menorca's brother Anthony petitioned the Supreme Court of the Philippines to issue writs of ''habeas corpus'' and ''amparo'' against the INC administration. The request was granted and on October 25, Menorca stated that he was illegally detained by INC, kidnapped by police officers allegedly in INC's employ and had been interrogated for 17 hours. He also stated that police officials tried to kill him afterwards using a hand grenade and that he had to beg for his life, successfully convincing a police officer allegedly hired to murder him not to go through with the killing.&lt;ref name="rappler1"/&gt;

====Menorca's arrest in connection with libel charges====
On January 20, 2016, on his way to the Court of Appeals to attend a hearing on the illegal detention case, policemen wearing civilian clothes and without badges led by Supt. Ed Leonardo and INC member, arrested Menorca on libel charges filed by the SCAN International in Kapatagan, Lanao del Norte.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/551925/news/metro/manila-cops-arrest-ex-iglesia-minister-before-ca-appearance|title=Manila cops arrest ex-Iglesia minister before CA appearance|publisher=''[[GMA News]]''|date=20 January 2016|accessdate=20 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A standoff between the police, Menorca and his wife Jinky occurred along Roxas Boulevard and Quirino Avenue when Menorca refused the arrest and claimed that the court had not notified him of libel charges. After the commotion, 20 policemen in uniform showed up to arrest Menorca.&lt;ref name="Menorca 2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/757081/ex-iglesia-minister-lowell-menorca-surrenders|title=Ex-Iglesia minister Lowell Menorca surrenders|publisher=''[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]]''|date=20 January 2016|accessdate=20 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; MPD Director Chief Supt.

The church, thru its spokesman Edwil Zabala, said the INC strongly denied any involvement with the standoff and told Menorca to face the libel charges against him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rappler.com/nation/119633-iglesia-ni-cristo-lowell-menorca-arrest|title=Ex-INC minister Menorca arrested on the way to court|publisher=''Rappler''|date=20 January 2016|accessdate=20 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eaglenews.ph/iglesia-ni-cristo-official-press-statement/|title=Iglesia Ni Cristo Official Press Statement|publisher=''Eagle News''|date=20 January 2016|accessdate=20 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Menorca receives asylum in Canada====
Menorca fled to [[Vietnam]] in March 2016. Moises Tolentino Jr., a lawyer for the Iglesia ni Cristo responded that: "Beset by several libel suits and an adultery charge to boot, [Menorca] took the cowardly option. He took a hurried flight last night bound for Vietnam. He is now a fugitive from justice.." and "Menorca is supposed to be the aggrieved party. If they were sincere, if they believed that they were in the right, they should not leave the country. They should face all opportunities that should be given to respondents..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rappler.com/nation/124970-lowell-menorca-fugitive-iglesia-ni-cristo|title=INC: Menorca a 'fugitive,' robbed Iglesia of chance to expose lies|last1=Francisco|first1=Katerina|publisher=[[Rappler]]|accessdate=22 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Menorca left Vietnam two weeks later and arrived in [[Vancouver]].

[[Pandi, Bulacan|Pandi]] Mayor Enrico Roque, president of LMP Bulacan, said that the taurpalin was displayed to express their continuing friendship and respect to the church, in response to a report that a Bulacan mayor complained to church leaders that a minister from the INC attempted to extort money from the official.

'''Acedia''' ({{IPAc-en|ə|ˈ|s|iː|d|i|ə}}; also '''accidie''' or '''accedie''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|æ|k|s|ᵻ|d|i}}, from [[Latin]] ''acedĭa'', and this from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] ἀκηδία, "negligence", ἀ- "lack of" -κηδία "care") is a state of listlessness or [[torpor]], of not caring or not being concerned with one's position or condition in the world.  It can lead to a state of being unable to perform one's duties in life.  Its spiritual overtones make it related to but arguably distinct from [[Depression (mood)|depression]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author = the hermitary and Meng-hu | title  = Acedia, Bane of Solitaries | url = http://www.hermitary.com/solitude/acedia.html | year = 2004 |accessdate =22 Dec 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090103154838/http://www.hermitary.com/solitude/acedia.html| archivedate= 3 January 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Acedia was originally noted as a problem among monks and other ascetics who maintained a solitary life.

==Aquinas' definition==

The ''Oxford Concise Dictionary of the Christian Church''&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.oxfordreference.com/views/ENTRY.html?subview=Main&amp;entry=t95.e35 accidie]"  ''The Concise Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church''. Ed. E. A. Livingstone. Oxford University Press, 2006. Oxford Reference Online. Oxford University Press. 1 November 2011&lt;/ref&gt; defines acedia (or accidie) as "a state of restlessness and inability either to work or to pray". Some see it as the precursor to [[Sloth (deadly sin)|sloth]]—one of the [[seven deadly sins]]. In his sustained analysis of the vice in Q. 35 of the ''Second Part (Secunda Secundae)'' of his ''[[Summa Theologica]]'', the 13th-century theologian [[Thomas Aquinas]] identifies acedia with "the sorrow of the world" (compare ''[[Weltschmerz]]'') that "worketh death" and contrasts it with that sorrow "according to God" described by [[Saint Paul|St. Paul]] in 2 Cor. 7:10. For Aquinas, acedia is "sorrow about spiritual good in as much as it is a Divine good." It becomes a [[mortal sin]] when reason consents to man's "flight" (''fuga'') from the Divine good, "on account of the flesh utterly prevailing over the spirit."&lt;ref&gt;''Summa'', II-II, 35, 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Acedia is essentially a flight from the divine that leads to not even caring that one does not care. The ultimate expression of this is a despair that ends in [[suicide]].

Aquinas's teaching on acedia in Q. 35 contrasts with his prior teaching on charity's gifted "spiritual joy", to which acedia is directly opposed, and which he explores in Q. 28 of the ''Secunda Secundae''. As Aquinas says, "One opposite is known through the other, as darkness through light. Hence also what evil is must be known from the nature of good."&lt;ref&gt;''Summa'', I, 48, 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ancient depictions==
[[Image:Brueghel - Sieben Laster - Disidia.jpg|thumb|250px|Acedia depicted by [[Pieter Bruegel the elder]].]]
Moral theologians, intellectual historians and cultural critics have variously construed acedia as the ancient depiction of a variety of psychological states, behaviors or existential conditions: primarily [[laziness]], [[apathy]], [[ennui]] or [[boredom]].

The demon of acedia holds an important place in early monastic [[demonology]] and proto-psychology. In the late fourth century [[Evagrius Ponticus|Evagrius of Pontus]], for example, characterizes it as "the most troublesome of all" of the eight genera of evil thoughts. As with those who followed him, Evagrius sees acedia as a temptation, and the great danger lies in giving in to it. Evagrius' contemporary, the [[Desert Father]] [[John Cassian]], depicted the apathetic restlessness of ''acedia'', "the noonday demon", in the [[Cenobitic monasticism|coenobitic]] monk:

&lt;blockquote&gt;He looks about anxiously this way and that, and sighs that none of the brethren come to see him, and often goes in and out of his cell, and frequently gazes up at the sun,  as if it was too slow in setting, and so a kind of unreasonable confusion of mind takes possession of him like some foul darkness.&lt;ref&gt;John Cassian, ''The Institutes'', (Boniface Ramsey, tr.) 2000:10:2, quoted in [[Stephen Greenblatt]], ''The Swerve: how the world became modern'', 2011:26.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the medieval Latin tradition of the [[seven deadly sins]], acedia has generally been folded into the sin of sloth. The [[Benedictine Rule]] directed that a monk displaying the outward signs of ''acedia'' 
&lt;blockquote&gt;"should be reproved a first and a second time. If he does not amend he must be subjected to the [[Corporal punishment|punishment of the rule]] so that the others may have fear.&lt;ref&gt;''ut ceteri timeant'': ''The Rule of Benedict'' 48:19-20, quoted in Greenblatt 2011:26: "The symptoms of psychic pain would be driven out by physical pain".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Signs==
[[Image:Kecske-templom 22.jpg|thumb|250px|Acedia depicted as a sleeping man and a bat in the Goat Church in Sopron, Hungary.]]
Acedia is indicated by a range of signs. These signs (or symptoms) are typically divided into two basic categories: somatic and psychological. Acedia frequently presents signs somatically. Such bodily symptoms range from mere sleepiness to general sickness or debility, along with a host of more specific symptoms: weakness in the knees, pain in the limbs, and fever.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}  An anecdote attributed to the [[Desert Mothers|Desert Mother Amma Theodora]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Forgotten Desert Mothers: Sayings, Lives, and Stories of Early Christian Women|author=Laura Swan|publisher=Paulist Press|year=2001|isbn=978-0-8091-4016-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; also connects somatic pain and illness with the onset of acedia. A host of psychological symptoms can also signify the presence of acedia, which affects the mental state and behavior of the afflicted.  Some commonly reported psychological signs revolve around a lack of attention to daily tasks and an overall dissatisfaction with life. The best-known of the psychological signs of acedia is tedium, boredom or general laziness. Author [[Kathleen_Norris_(poet)|Kathleen Norris]] in her book ''Acedia and Me'' asserts that dictionary definitions such as torpor and sloth fail to do justice to this "temptation"; she believes a state of restlessness, of not living in the present and seeing the future as overwhelming is more accurate a definition than straight laziness: it is especially present in monasteries, due to the cutting off of distractions, but can invade any vocation where the labor is long, the rewards slow to appear, such as scientific research, long term marriages, etc. Another sign is a lack of caring, of being unfeeling about things, whether that be your appearance, hygiene, your relationships, your community's welfare, the world's welfare etc.; all of this, Norris relates, is connected to the hopelessness and vague unease that arises from having too many choices, lacking true commitment, of being "a slave from within". She relates this to forgetfulness about "the one thing needful": remembrance of God.

==In culture==
*Acedia plays an important role in the literary criticism of [[Walter Benjamin]].  In his study of [[baroque]] literature, ''[[The Origin of German Tragic Drama]]'', Benjamin describes acedia as a moral failing, an "indolence of the heart" that ruins great men. Benjamin considers acedia to be a key feature of many [[baroque]] tragic heroes, from the minor dramatic figures of German tragedy to Shakespeare's [[Hamlet]]: "The indecisiveness of the prince, in particular, is nothing other than saturnine ''acedia.''" It is this slothful inability to make decisions that leads baroque tragic heroes to passively accept their fate, rather than resisting it in the heroic manner of classical tragedy.&lt;ref name="BenjamínOsborne2003"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Walter Benjamín|author2=John Osborne|title=The origin of German tragic drama|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jwy7yFgFN4IC|accessdate=20 August 2011|year=2003|publisher=Verso|isbn=978-1-85984-413-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Roger Fry]] saw acedia or gloominess as a twentieth century peril to be fought by a mixture of work and of determined pleasure in life.&lt;ref&gt;H. Lee, ''Virginia Wolff'' (1996) p. 708&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Chekhov]] and [[Samuel Becket]]'s plays often have themes of acedia.
*[[Aldous Huxley]] wrote an essay on acedia called "Accidie". A non-Christian, he examines "the noon day demons" original delineation by the Desert Fathers, and concludes that it is one of the main diseases of the modern age.
*The writer David J. Cord claimed acedia can even affect an entire organization, and in [[The Decline and Fall of Nokia]] cites a culture of acedia as a prime cause for the collapse of [[Nokia]]'s mobile device unit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cord|first1=David|title=The Decline and Fall of Nokia|date=2014|publisher=Schildts &amp; Söderströms|isbn=978-951-52-3320-2|pages=244–245}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="653">The '''air-to-cloth ratio''' is the [[volumetric flow rate]] of air (m³/[[minute]]; [[Systeme International|SI]] m³/[[second]]) flowing through a [[dust collector]]'s inlet duct divided by the total cloth [[area]] (m²) in the filters. The result is expressed in units of [[velocity]].

:&lt;math&gt; v = {V / \Delta t \over {A}} &lt;/math&gt;

The air-to-cloth ratio is typically between 1.5 and 3.5 metres per [[minute]], mainly depending on the concentration of dust loading.

'''Anupadaka''', '''anupapadaka''', '''aupapaduka''' ([[Skt.]], 'parentless; self-existing,') is a philosophical term about reality such as the 'anupadaka plane'&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Webster Leadbeater]], ''A Textbook of Theosophy'', Madras, India: Theosophical Publishing House, 1912.&lt;/ref&gt; or gods or [[Dhyani]]-[[Buddhas]] that fit the definition.  Actually beyond anupadaka is '[[adi (metaphysical plane)|adi]]' (Skt., 'first,') having to do with the [[first cause]], itself from [[causeless cause]].

Hence, it does not matter if scientists think there are no gods or Dhyani-Buddhas: anupadaka is still an idea about something that is an effect of the first cause or [[causality]].  In that sense it may have to do with a scientific idea or the term can be applied to one: the term came to the West from [[Theosophy (Boehmian)|Theosophy]], which focuses on science as much as religion, and 'anupadaka' may have distinct meanings in Theosophy.

In [[Buddhism]], an '''anāgāmi''' ([[Sanskrit]] and [[Pāli]] for "non-returning")&lt;ref&gt;Rhys Davids &amp; Stede (1921-25), pp. 31, 95, entries for "Anāgāmin" (retrieved 17 November 2018 at https://dsalsrv04.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/app/pali_query.py?qs=An%C4%81g%C4%81min&amp;searchhws=yes) and "Āgāmin" (at https://dsalsrv04.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/app/pali_query.py?qs=%C4%80g%C4%81min&amp;searchhws=yes).&lt;/ref&gt; is a partially [[bodhi|enlightened]] person who has cut off the first five [[Fetter (Buddhism)|chain]]s that bind the ordinary mind. Anāgāmis are the third of the [[four stages of enlightenment|four aspirants]].

Anagamis are not reborn into the human world after death, but into the heaven of the [[Buddhist cosmology#Pure Abodes|Pure Abodes]], where only anāgāmis live. There they attain full enlightenment ([[arhat|arahant]]ship).

The Pali terms for the specific chains or fetters (Pali: {{IAST|saṃyojana}}) of which an anāgāmi is free are:
#{{IAST|[[Fetter_(Buddhism)#Identity_view_.28sakk.C4.81ya-di.E1.B9.AD.E1.B9.ADhi.29|Sakkāya-diṭṭhi]]}}: Belief in [[Ātman (Buddhism)|atmān]] or self
#[[Fetter_(Buddhism)#Attachment_to_rites_and_rituals_.28s.C4.ABlabbata-par.C4.81m.C4.81so.29|Sīlabbata-parāmāsa]]: Attachment to rites and rituals
#[[vicikitsa|Vicikicchā]]: Skeptical doubt
#Kāma-rāga: Sensuous craving
#Byāpāda: ill will&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Byāpāda|url=http://dsalsrv02.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.2:1:3399.pali|publisher=[[Pali Text Society]] Pali-English Dictionary|accessdate=November 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fetters from which an anāgāmi is not yet free are:
#Rūparāga: Craving for fine-material existence (the first 4 [[Dhyāna in Buddhism|jhana]]s)
#Arūparāga: Craving for immaterial existence (the last 4 jhanas)
#[[Māna]]: Conceit
#[[Auddhatya|Uddhacca]]: Restlessness
#[[Avidyā (Buddhism)|Avijjā]]: Ignorance

Kāmarāga and Byāpāda, which they are free from, can also be interpreted as craving for becoming and non-becoming, respectively.
Anāgāmis are at an intermediate stage between [[sakadagami]]s and arahants. Arahants enjoy complete freedom from the ten [[Fetter (Buddhism)|fetter]]s. An anāgāmi's mind is very pure.

In late 2016, following Trump's electoral victory, conflict arose between Cernovich and Gionet regarding Gionet's views on race.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Smith|first1=Allan|title=Alt-right movement descends into civil war after leading figure is booted from Trump inauguration event|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/alt-right-civil-war-twitter-cernovich-milo-alaska-2016-12|website=Business Insider|accessdate=June 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gionet was disinvited from "[[DeploraBall]]" after making anti-Semitic remarks on Twitter.

In February 2017, Gionet called for a boycott of [[Netflix]] in response to the announcement of ''[[Dear White People (TV series)|Dear White People]]'', a show Gionet said supported [[White genocide conspiracy theory|white genocide]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Alt-Right Dickheads Bravely Cancel Their Netflix Subscriptions Over 'Dear White People' |url=https://gizmodo.com/alt-right-dickheads-bravely-cancel-their-netflix-subscr-1792149955 |publisher=[[Gizmodo]] |date=February 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gionet participated in the "Freedom of Speech" rally outside the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, DC on June 25, 2017, and he was scheduled to address [[white nationalists]] at the [[Unite the Right rally]] in [[Charlottesville, Virginia]] on August 11, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Porter|first1=Tom|title=Who are the Alt-Right Leaders Addressing the White Nationalist Rally in Charlottesville?|url=http://www.newsweek.com/alt-right-leaders-are-addressing-largest-white-nationalist-rally-decades-650096|website=Newsweek|accessdate=August 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tognotti" /&gt;

As of November 15, 2017, his Twitter account has been suspended.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

Gionet supports the white supremacist [[Fourteen Words]] and has stated that there's "nothing wrong" with the slogan.

[[Image:Johann Heinrich Füssli 054.jpg|thumb|[[Henry Fuseli]]'s painting of Odysseus facing the choice between Scylla and Charybdis, 1794/6]]
Being '''between Scylla and Charybdis''' is an idiom deriving from Greek mythology, meaning "having to choose between two evils". Several other idioms, such as "on the horns of a dilemma", "[[between the devil and the deep blue sea]]", and "[[between a rock and a hard place]]" express similar  meanings.

==The myth and the proverb==
[[Scylla]] and [[Charybdis]] were mythical [[sea monsters]] noted by [[Homer]]; Greek mythology sited them on opposite sides of the [[Strait of Messina]] between [[Sicily]] and the Italian mainland. Scylla was rationalized as a rock [[shoal]] (described as a six-headed sea monster) on the Italian side of the strait and Charybdis was a [[whirlpool]] off the coast of Sicily. They were regarded as maritime hazards located close enough to each other that they posed an inescapable threat to passing sailors; avoiding Charybdis meant passing too close to Scylla and vice versa. According to Homer, [[Odysseus]] was forced to choose which monster to confront while passing through the strait; he opted to pass by Scylla and lose only a few sailors, rather than risk the loss of his entire ship in the whirlpool.

Because of such stories, having to navigate between the two hazards eventually entered idiomatic use.  Another equivalent English seafaring phrase is, "Between a rock and a hard place".&lt;ref&gt;Definition from the ''Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English'' [http://www.ldoceonline.com/dictionary/Scylla-and-Charybdis available online]&lt;/ref&gt; The Latin line ''incidit in scyllam cupiens vitare charybdim'' (he runs into Scylla, wishing to avoid Charybdis) had earlier become proverbial, with a meaning much the same as [[jumping from the frying pan into the fire]]. [[Erasmus]] recorded it as an ancient proverb in his ''[[Adagia]]'', although the earliest known instance is in the ''[[Alexandreis]]'', a 12th-century Latin [[epic poetry|epic poem]] by [[Walter of Châtillon]].&lt;ref&gt;Noted by [[Edward Charles Harington]] in [https://books.google.com/books?id=7mIEAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA10 ''Notes and Queries'' 5th Series, '''8''' (7 July 1877:14)].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural and popular references==
The myth was given an allegorical interpretation by the French poet [[Barthélemy Aneau]] in his [[emblem book]] ''Picta Poesis'' (1552). There one is advised to choose the risk of being envied for wealth or reputation rather than swallowed by the Charybdis of poverty. "Choose the lesser of these evils. A wise man would rather be envied than miserable."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.emblems.arts.gla.ac.uk/french/emblem.php?id=FANa072 French Emblems at Glasgow]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:GillrayBritannia.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.2|[[James Gillray]], ''Britannia between Scylla and Charybdis'' (1793)]]
The story was often applied to political situations at a later date. In [[James Gillray]]'s cartoon, ''Britannia between Scylla and Charybdis'' (3 June 1793),&lt;ref&gt;Published by H. Humphrey, London 8 April 1793&lt;/ref&gt; '[[William Pitt the Younger|William Pitt]] helms the ship ''Constitution'', containing an alarmed Britannia, between the rock of democracy (with the liberty cap on its summit) and the whirlpool of arbitrary power (in the shape of an inverted crown), to the distant haven of liberty'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Iain |last=Hampsher-Monk |title=The Impact of the French Revolution |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2005 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8qWwQqPeqBQC&amp;dq=%22%27William+Pitt+helms+the+ship+Constitution%2C+containing+an+alarmed+Britannia%2C+between+the+rock+of+democracy+%28with+the+liberty+cap+on+its+summit%29+and+the+whirlpool+of+arbitrary+power+%28in+the+shape+of+an+inverted+crown%29%2C+to+the+distant+haven+of+liberty%22&amp;q=Scylla#v=snippet&amp;q=Scylla&amp;f=false |isbn=0-521-57005-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was in the context of the effect of the [[French Revolution]] on politics in Britain. That the dilemma had still to be resolved in the aftermath of the revolution is suggested by [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]]'s returning to the idiom in his 1820 essay ''[[A Defence of Poetry]]'': "The rich have become richer, and the poor have become poorer; and the vessel of the state is driven between the Scylla and Charybdis of anarchy and despotism."&lt;ref&gt;The Harvard Classics, section 33; [http://www.bartleby.com/27/23.html available online]&lt;/ref&gt;

A later ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'' caricature by [[John Tenniel]], dated 10 October 1863, pictures the [[Prime Minister]] [[Henry John Temple, 3rd Viscount Palmerston|Lord Palmerston]] carefully steering the British ship of state between the perils of Scylla, a craggy rock in the form of a grim-visaged [[Abraham Lincoln]], and Charybdis, a whirlpool which foams and froths into a likeness of [[Jefferson Davis]]. A shield emblazoned "Neutrality" hangs on the ship's thwarts, referring to how Palmerston tried to maintain a strict impartiality towards both combatants in the [[American Civil War]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abrahamlincolncartoons.info/SubPages/Cartoon.php?UniqueID=415 View online]&lt;/ref&gt; American satirical magazine ''[[Puck (magazine)|Puck]]'' also used the myth in a caricature by F. Graetz, dated November 26, 1884, in which the unmarried President-elect [[Grover Cleveland]] rows desperately between snarling monsters captioned "Mother-in-law" and "Office Seekers".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historyonthenet.com/authentichistory/1865-1897/3-gilded/4-cleveland1 Scroll down on History on the Net]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Victor Hugo]] uses the equivalent French idiom (''tomber de Charybde en Scylla'') in his novel ''[[Les Miserables]]'' (1862), again in a political context, as a metaphor for the staging of two rebel barricades during the climactic uprising in Paris, around which the final events of the book culminate. The first chapter of the final volume is entitled "The Charybdis of the Faubourg Saint Antoine and the Scylla of the Faubourg du Temple".

By the time of [[Nicholas Monsarrat]]'s 1951 war novel, ''[[The Cruel Sea (novel)|The Cruel Sea]]'', however, the upper-class junior officer, Morell, is teased by his middle-class peer, Lockhart, for using such an old-fashioned phrase. Nevertheless, the idiom has since taken on new life in pop lyrics. In [[The Police]]'s 1983 single "[[Wrapped Around Your Finger]]", the second line uses it as a metaphor for being in a dangerous relationship; this is reinforced by a later mention of the similar idiom of "the devil and the deep blue sea".&lt;ref&gt;The words are [http://www.elyrics.net/read/p/police-lyrics/wrapped-around-your-finger-lyrics.html online]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{youtube|id=Gondjza0sUs}}&lt;/ref&gt; American heavy metal band [[Trivium (band)|Trivium]] also referenced the idiom in "Torn Between Scylla and Charybdis", a track from their 2008 album ''Shogun'', in which the lyrics are about having to choose "between death and doom".&lt;ref&gt;{{youtube|id=9BZByugVukA|title=The song with lyrics}} (words also available online.)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014 [[Graham Waterhouse]] composed a [[piano quartet]], ''[[Skylla and Charybdis (Waterhouse)|Skylla and Charybdis]]'', premiered at the [[Gasteig]] in [[Munich]]. According to his programme note, though its four movements "do not refer specifically to the protagonists or to events connected with the famous legend", their dynamic is linked subjectively to  images connected with it "conjoured up in the composer's mind during the writing".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.arbc.de/Waterhouse/werke.htm#skylla Composer's website]&lt;/ref&gt;

Most people appear to exhibit the bias blind spot. In a sample of more than 600 residents of the United States, more than 85% believed they were less biased than the average American. Only one participant believed that he or she was more biased than the average American. People do vary with regard to the extent to which they exhibit the bias blind spot. It appears to be a stable individual difference that is measurable (for a scale, see Scopelliti et al. 2015).&lt;ref name="Scopelliti2015"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Bias Blind Spot: Structure, Measurement, and Consequences |journal=[[Management Science (journal)|Management Science]] |volume = 61|issue = 10|pages = 2468–2486|date = 2015|doi = 10.1287/mnsc.2014.2096|language = en|first = Irene|last = Scopelliti|first2 = Carey K.|last2 = Morewedge|first3 = Erin|last3 = McCormick|first4 = H.

The bias blind spot appears to be a true blind spot in that it is unrelated to actual [[Decision-making|decision making]] ability. Performance on indices of decision making competence are not related to individual differences in bias blind spot. In other words, everyone seems to think they are less biased than other people, regardless of their actual decision making ability.&lt;ref name="Scopelliti2015" /&gt;

==Causes==
Bias blind spots may be caused by a variety of other biases and self-deceptions.&lt;ref name=page&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Page|first1=Antony|title=Unconscious Bias and the Limits of Director Independence|journal=University of Illinois Law Review|date=2009|volume=2009|issue=1|pages=237–294|url=https://illinoislawreview.org/article/unconscious-bias-and-the-limits-of-director-independence/|issn=0276-9948|SSRN=1392625|access-date=2016-06-11|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160625122910/https://illinoislawreview.org/article/unconscious-bias-and-the-limits-of-director-independence/|archive-date=2016-06-25|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Self-enhancement biases may play a role, in that people are motivated to view themselves in a positive light. Biases are generally seen as undesirable,&lt;ref name=Pronin2007&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.tics.2006.11.001|pmid=17129749|title=Perception and misperception of bias in human judgment|journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences|volume=11|issue=1|pages=37–43|year=2007|last1=Pronin|first1=Emily}}&lt;/ref&gt; so people tend to think of their own perceptions and judgments as being rational, accurate, and free of bias. The self-enhancement bias also applies when analyzing our own decisions, in that people are likely to think of themselves as better decision makers than others.&lt;ref name="page" /&gt;

People also tend to believe they are aware of "how" and "why" they make their decisions, and therefore conclude that bias did not play a role. Many of our decisions are formed from biases and cognitive shortcuts, which are unconscious processes. By definition, people are unaware of [[Unconscious cognition|unconscious processes]], and therefore cannot see their influence in the decision making process.&lt;ref name="page" /&gt;

When made aware of various biases acting on our perception, decisions, or judgments, research has shown that we are still unable to control them. This contributes to the bias blind spot in that even if one is told that they are biased, they are unable to alter their biased perception.&lt;ref name="page" /&gt;

==Role of introspection==
Emily Pronin and Matthew Kugler have argued that this phenomenon is due to the [[introspection illusion]].&lt;ref name="gilovich"/&gt; In their experiments, subjects had to make judgments about themselves and about other subjects.&lt;ref name="blindspot"&gt;{{cite journal |date= 2007 |title=Valuing thoughts, ignoring behavior: The introspection illusion as a source of the bias blind spot |journal=[[Journal of Experimental Social Psychology]] |publisher=Elsevier |volume=43 |issue=4 |pages=565–578 |doi=10.1016/j.jesp.2006.05.011|last1=Pronin |first1=Emily |last2=Kugler |first2=Matthew B. }}&lt;/ref&gt; They displayed standard biases, for example rating themselves above the others on desirable qualities (demonstrating [[illusory superiority]]). The experimenters explained cognitive bias, and asked the subjects how it might have affected their judgment. The subjects rated themselves as less susceptible to bias than others in the experiment (confirming the bias blind spot). When they had to explain their judgments, they used different strategies for assessing their own and others' bias.

Pronin and Kugler's interpretation is that, when people decide whether someone else is biased, they use overt behaviour. On the other hand, when assessing whether they themselves are biased, people [[Introspection|look inward]], searching their own thoughts and feelings for biased motives.&lt;ref name="gilovich"&gt;{{cite book |last=Gilovich |first=Thomas |author2=Nicholas Epley|author3=Karlene Hanko |title=The Self in Social Judgment |editor=Mark D. Alicke |editor2=David A. Dunning |editor3=Joachim I. Krueger |publisher=[[Psychology Press]] |location=New York |year=2005 |series=Studies in Self and Identity |page=77 |chapter=Shallow Thoughts About the Self: The Automatic Components of Self-Assessment |isbn=978-1-84169-418-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since biases operate [[unconsciously]], these [[introspection]]s are not informative, but people wrongly treat them as reliable indication that they themselves, unlike other people, are immune to bias.&lt;ref name="blindspot"/&gt;

Pronin and Kugler tried to give their subjects access to others' introspections. To do this, they made audio recordings of subjects who had been told to say whatever came into their heads as they decided whether their answer to a previous question might have been affected by bias.&lt;ref name="blindspot"/&gt; Although subjects persuaded themselves they were unlikely to be biased, their introspective reports did not sway the assessments of observers.

==Differences of perceptions==
People tend to attribute bias in an uneven way. When people reach different perceptions, they tend to label one another as biased while labelling themselves as accurate and unbiased. Pronin hypothesizes that this bias misattribution may be a source of conflict and misunderstanding between people. For example, in labeling another person as biased, one may also label their intentions cynically. But when examining one's own cognitions, people judge themselves based on their good intentions. It is likely that in this case, one may attribute another's bias to "intentional malice" rather than an unconscious process.&lt;ref name="Pronin2008"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1126/science.1154199|pmid=18511681|title=How We See Ourselves and How We See Others|journal=Science|volume=320|issue=5880|pages=1177–1180|year=2008|last1=Pronin|first1=E.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pronin also hypothesizes ways to use awareness of the bias blind spot to reduce conflict, and to think in a more "scientifically informed" way. Although we are unable to control bias on our own cognitions,&lt;ref name="page" /&gt; one may keep in mind that biases are acting on everyone. Pronin suggests that people might use this knowledge to separate other's intentions from their actions.&lt;ref name="Pronin2008" /&gt;

== Relation to actual commission of bias ==
Initial evidence suggests that the bias blind spot is not related to actual decision-making ability.&lt;ref name="Scopelliti2015" /&gt; Participants who scored better or poorer on various tasks associated with decision making competence were no more or less likely to be higher or lower in their susceptibility to bias blind spot. Bias blind spot does, however, appear to increase susceptibility to related biases. People who are high in bias blind spot are more likely to ignore the advice of other people, and are less likely to benefit from training geared to reduce their commission of other biases.

'''Biomimetics''' or '''biomimicry''' is the imitation of the models, systems, and elements of nature for the purpose of solving complex [[human]] problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Vincent|first1=Julian F. V.|title=Biomimetics: its practice and theory|journal=Journal of the Royal Society Interface|volume=3|issue=9|pages=471–482|url=http://rsif.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/3/9/471|accessdate=7 April 2015|doi=10.1098/rsif.2006.0127|pmid=16849244|pmc=1664643|date=22 August 2006|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; The terms "biomimetics" and "biomimicry" derive from {{lang-grc|βίος}} (''bios''), life, and μίμησις (''[[mimesis|mīmēsis]]''), imitation, from μιμεῖσθαι (''mīmeisthai''), to imitate, from μῖμος (''mimos''), actor. A closely related field is '''[[bionics]]'''.&lt;ref name=McCarty/&gt;

Living organisms have [[evolution|evolved]] [[adaptation (biology)|well-adapted]] structures and materials over geological time through [[natural selection]]. Biomimetics has given rise to new technologies inspired by [[biological]] solutions at macro and nanoscales. Humans have looked at nature for answers to problems throughout our existence. Nature has solved engineering problems such as self-healing abilities, environmental exposure tolerance and resistance, [[hydrophobicity]], self-assembly, and harnessing solar energy.

== History ==

One of the early examples of would-be biomimicry was the study of [[birds]] to enable [[human flight]]. Although never successful in creating a "flying machine", [[Leonardo da Vinci]] (1452–1519) was a keen observer of the anatomy and flight of birds, and made numerous notes and sketches on his observations as well as sketches of "flying machines".&lt;ref name="Romei 2008 56"&gt;{{Cite book | last=Romei | first=Francesca | title=Leonardo Da Vinci | publisher=The Oliver Press  | year=2008 | location=| page=56 | isbn=978-1-934545-00-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Wright Brothers]], who succeeded in flying the first heavier-than-air aircraft in 1903, allegedly derived inspiration from observations of pigeons in flight.&lt;ref&gt;Compare: {{Cite book | last=Howard | first=Fred | title=Wilbur and Orville: A Biography of the Wright Brothers | publisher=Dober Publications | year=1998 | location=| page=33 | isbn=978-0-486-40297-0 | quote = According to Wilbur, he and his brother discovered the birds' method of lateral control one day while observing a flight of pigeons. [...] 'Although we intently watched birds fly in a hope of learning something from them,' [Orville] wrote in 1941, 'I cannot think of anything that was first learned in that way.'}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:Leonardo Design for a Flying Machine, c. 1488.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Leonardo da Vinci]]'s [[Science and inventions of Leonardo da Vinci#Flight|design for a flying machine]] with wings based closely upon the structure of bat wings.]]During the 1950s the American [[biophysicist]] and [[polymath]] [[Otto Schmitt]] developed the concept of "biomimetics".&lt;ref name="Vincent2006"&gt;{{cite journal |last= Vincent |first= Julian F.V. |author2= Bogatyreva, Olga A. |author3= Bogatyrev, Nikolaj R. |author4= Bowyer, Adrian |author5= Pahl, Anja-Karina |title= Biomimetics: its practice and theory |journal= Journal of the Royal Society Interface |date= 21 August 2006|volume= 3|issue= 9|pages= 471–482|doi= 10.1098/rsif.2006.0127 |pmid= 16849244 |pmc= 1664643}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his doctoral research he developed the [[Schmitt trigger]] by studying the nerves in squid, attempting to engineer a device that replicated the biological system of [[nerve impulse|nerve propagation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Otto H.

{{quote|Biophysics is not so much a subject matter as it is a point of view. It is an approach to problems of biological science utilizing the theory and technology of the physical sciences. Conversely, biophysics is also a biologist's approach to problems of physical science and engineering, although this aspect has largely been neglected.|Otto Herbert Schmitt|In Appreciation, A Lifetime of Connections: Otto Herbert Schmitt, 1913 - 1998}}

In 1960 [[Jack E. Steele]] coined a similar term, ''[[bionics]]'', at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton, Ohio, where Otto Schmitt also worked. Steele defined bionics as "the science of systems which have some function copied from nature, or which represent characteristics of natural systems or their analogues".&lt;ref name="McCarty"&gt;Mary McCarty. [https://web.archive.org/web/20110604025951/http://www.daytondailynews.com/o/content/oh/story/opinions/columns/2009/01/29/ddn012909mary.html?cxntlid=inform_sr "Life of bionics founder a fine adventure"]. ''Dayton Daily News'', 29 January 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="vincent-2009"&gt;{{cite journal |last= Vincent|first= Julian F. V. |title= Biomimetics -- a review |journal= Journal of Engineering in Medicine |date= November 2009|volume= 223 |series= Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers.

{{quote|Let us consider what bionics has come to mean operationally and what it or some word like it (I prefer biomimetics) ought to mean in order to make good use of the technical skills of scientists specializing, or rather, I should say, despecializing into this area of research|Otto Herbert Schmitt|In Appreciation, A Lifetime of Connections: Otto Herbert Schmitt, 1913 - 1998}}

In 1969 Schmitt used the term “biomimetic“ in the title one of his papers,&lt;ref&gt;Schmitt O. Third Int. Biophysics Congress. 1969. Some interesting and useful biomimetic transforms. p. 297.&lt;/ref&gt; and by 1974 it had found its way into [[Webster's Dictionary]], bionics entered the same dictionary earlier in 1960 as "a science concerned with the application of data about the functioning of biological systems to the solution of engineering problems". Bionic took on a different connotation when [[Martin Caidin]] referenced Jack Steele and his work in the novel ''Cyborg'' which later resulted in the 1974 television series ''[[The Six Million Dollar Man]]'' and its spin-offs. The term bionic then became associated with "the use of electronically operated artificial body parts" and "having ordinary human powers increased by or as if by the aid of such devices".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Compact Oxford English Dictionary |year=2008 |publisher= |location= |isbn=978-0-19-953296-4|last1=Soanes |first1=Catherine |last2=Hawker |first2=Sara }}&lt;/ref&gt; Because the term ''bionic'' took on the implication of supernatural strength, the scientific community in [[english language|English]] speaking countries largely abandoned it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last =Vincent | first =JFV | title =Biomimetics — a review | journal =Proc. Inst. Mech. Eng.| volume =223 | issue=| pages=919–939 | year=2009 | url=| issn=| doi =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''biomimicry'' appeared as early as 1982.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last=Merrill | first=Connie Lange | title=Biomimicry of the Dioxygen Active Site in the Copper Proteins Hemocyanin and Cytochrome Oxidase  | location=Rice University  | year=1982  | accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Biomimicry was popularized by scientist and author [[Janine Benyus]] in her 1997 book ''Biomimicry: Innovation Inspired by Nature''. Biomimicry is defined in the book as a "new science that studies nature's models and then imitates or takes inspiration from these designs and processes to solve human problems". Benyus suggests looking to Nature as a "Model, Measure, and Mentor" and emphasizes sustainability as an objective of biomimicry.&lt;ref name="Benyus 1997"&gt;{{cite book |last=Benyus |first=Janine |title=Biomimicry: Innovation Inspired by Nature |year=1997 |publisher=[[William Morrow &amp; Company]] |location=New York, USA |isbn=978-0-688-16099-9 |ref=Benyus97}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Bio-inspired technologies ==
Biomimetics could in principle be applied in many fields. Because of the diversity and complexity of biological systems, the number of features that might be imitated is large. Biomimetic applications are at various stages of development from technologies that might become commercially usable to prototypes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bhushan|first1=Bharat|date=15 March 2009|title=Biomimetics: lessons from nature-an overview|url=http://rsta.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/367/1893/1445.full|journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society A: Mathematical, Physical and Engineering Sciences|volume=367|issue=1893|pages=1445–1486|doi=10.1098/rsta.2009.0011|pmid=19324719}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Murray's law]], which in conventional form determined the optimum diameter of blood vessels, has been re-derived to provide simple equations for the pipe or tube diameter which gives a minimum mass engineering system.&lt;ref name="williams"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Williams|first=Hugo R.|author2=Trask, Richard S.|author3=Weaver, Paul M.|author4=Bond, Ian P.|year=2008|title=Minimum mass vascular networks in multifunctional materials|url=http://rsif.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/5/18/55.full|journal=Journal of the Royal Society Interface|volume=5|issue=18|pages=55–65|doi=10.1098/rsif.2007.1022|pmc=2605499|pmid=17426011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Construction and architecture ===
Researchers studied the [[termite]]'s ability to maintain virtually constant temperature and humidity in their [[termite mound]]s in Africa despite outside temperatures that vary from 1.5&amp;nbsp;°C to 40&amp;nbsp;°C (35&amp;nbsp;°F to 104&amp;nbsp;°F).  Researchers initially scanned a termite mound and created 3-D images of the mound structure, which revealed construction that could influence human [[building design]].

Analysis of the elastic deformation happening when a pollinisator lands on the sheath-like perch part of the flower [[Strelitzia reginae|''Strelitzia reginae'']] (known as [[Strelitzia|Bird-of-Paradise]] flower) has inspired architects and scientists from the [[University of Freiburg]] and [[University of Stuttgart]] for the creation of hingeless shading systems that can react to their environment.

=== Structural materials ===
There is a great need for new structural materials that are light weight but offer exceptional combinations of [[stiffness]], strength and [[toughness]].  

Such materials would need to be manufactured into bulk materials with complex shapes at high volume and low cost and would serve a variety of fields such as construction, transportation, energy storage and conversion. In a classic design problem, strength and toughness are more likely to be mutually exclusive i.e., strong materials are brittle and tough materials are weak. However, natural materials with complex and hierarchical material gradients that span from [[Nanoscopic scale|nano]]- to macro-scales are both strong and tough. Generally, most natural materials utilize limited chemical components but complex material architectures that give rise to exceptional mechanical properties.

Marine [[Mussel|mussels]] can stick easily and efficiently to surfaces underwater under the harsh conditions of the ocean. Mussels use strong filaments to adhere to rocks in the inter-tidal zones of wave-swept beaches, preventing them from being swept away in strong sea currents. Mussel foot proteins attach the filaments to rocks, boats and practically any surface in nature including other mussels. These proteins contain a mix of [[amino acid]] residues which has been adapted specifically for [[adhesive]] purposes. Researchers from the University of California Santa Barbara borrowed and simplified chemistries that the mussel foot uses to overcome this engineering challenge of wet adhesion to create copolyampholytes,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Seo|first=Sungbaek|last2=Das|first2=Saurabh|last3=Zalicki|first3=Piotr J.|last4=Mirshafian|first4=Razieh|last5=Eisenbach|first5=Claus D.|last6=Israelachvili|first6=Jacob N.|last7=Waite|first7=J.

Most [[virus]]es have an outer capsule 20 to 300&amp;nbsp;nm in diameter. Virus capsules are remarkably robust and capable of withstanding temperatures as high as 60&amp;nbsp;°C; they are stable across the [[pH]] range 2-10.&lt;ref name="Tong" /&gt; Viral capsules can be used to create nano device components such as nanowires, nanotubes, and quantum dots. Tubular virus particles such as the [[tobacco mosaic virus]] (TMV) can be used as templates to create nanofibers and nanotubes, since both the inner and outer layers of the virus are charged surfaces which can induce nucleation of crystal growth. 

This was demonstrated through the production of [[platinum]] and [[gold]] nanotubes using TMV as a template.&lt;ref name="Dujardin"&gt;Dujardin E., Peet C. "Nano Letters" 2003. 3:413.&lt;/ref&gt;  Mineralized virus particles have been shown to withstand various pH values by mineralizing the viruses with different materials such as silicon, [[Lead(II) sulfide|PbS]], and [[Cadmium sulfide|CdS]] and could therefore serve as a useful carriers of material.&lt;ref name="Shenton"&gt;Shenton W. Douglas, Young M. "Advanced Materials" 1999. 11:253.&lt;/ref&gt;  A spherical plant virus called [[cowpea chlorotic mottle virus]] (CCMV) has interesting expanding properties when exposed to environments of pH higher than 6.5.  Above this pH, 60 independent pores with diameters about 2&amp;nbsp;nm begin to exchange substance with the environment.  The structural transition of the viral capsid can be utilized in [[Biomineralization|Biomorphic mineralization]] for selective uptake and deposition of minerals by controlling the solution pH.  Possible applications include using the viral cage to produce uniformly shaped and sized quantum dot [[semiconductor]] nanoparticles through a series of pH washes.  This is an alternative to the [[Ferritin|apoferritin]] cage technique currently used to synthesize uniform CdSe nanoparticles.&lt;ref&gt;Ischiro Yamashita, Junko Hayashi, Mashahiko Hara. "Bio-template Synthesis of Uniform CdSe Nanoparticles Using Cage-shaped Protein, Apoferritin." Chemistry Letters (2004). Volume: 33, Issue: 9. 1158–1159.&lt;/ref&gt; Such materials could also be used for targeted drug delivery since particles release contents upon exposure to specific pH levels.

'''''Book of the Civilized Man by Daniel of Beccles''''' ({{lang-la|Urbanus Magnus Danielis Becclesiensis}}, also known as '''''Liber Urbani''''', '''''Urbanus Magnus''''', or '''''Civilized Man''''') is believed to be the first English [[courtesy book]] (or book of manners), dating probably from the beginning of the 13th century. The book is significant because in the later [[Middle Ages]] dozens of such courtesy books were produced. Because this appears to be the first in English history, it represented a new awakening to [[etiquette]] and decorum in English court society, which occurred in the 13th century. As a general rule, a book of etiquette is a mark of a dynamic rather than a stable society, one in which there is an influx of "new" men, who have not been indoctrinated with the correct decorum from an early age and who are avid to catch up in a hurry.

==The poem==
''Civilized Man'' is a 3000-line [[Latin]] [[Verse (poetry)|verse]] poem that gives proper advice on a wide range of social situations that the typical medieval person might have encountered in day-to-day life.

Examples include:
*If you wish to belch, remember to look up to the ceiling.
*Do not attack your enemy while he is squatting to defecate.
*If there is something you do not want people to know, do not tell it to your wife.
*Say thank you to your host.
*Don't mount your horse in the hall.
*If visitors had already eaten, give them drink anyway.
*Loosen your reins when riding over a bridge.
*Receive gifts from great men with gratitude.
*If you are a judge, be just.
*Eating at the table of the rich, speak little.
*The book ends with "Old King Henry first gave to the uncourtly the teaching written in this book."

==The poet==
Historians believe that Daniel of Beccles may have been a member of [[Henry II of England|Henry II]]'s court. [[John Bale]] (16th century) wrote that he had seen a document showing Daniel in Henry's court for over 30 years. This, the fact that a Henry is mentioned in the text, and some of the manuscripts can be dated to the early 13th century, make it very probable the poem dates from that period. There a reference to a Daniel of Beccles in the "Seventh Regnal Year of King John" (circa 1206) secretly being given the patronage (advowson) of the church of Endgate in Beccles by the Abbot of Bury St Edmund's.

==Three themes==
There are three major recurrent themes in the poem: social hierarchy, self-control and sexual morality.

The first theme is the emphasis on [[social hierarchy]] and how to behave around those of higher or lower status (lords and servants). The poem takes the general tone of addressing the reader as someone who is a "householder". This can be seen in the opening lines of the poem "Reader, if you wish to be adorned with good manners, if you wish to be respected and lead a civilized life as a noble householder...". In other words, it addresses a very minor upper percentage of the general population who own households and have servants, the class that from the 16th century might be identified as "country [[gentry]]".

The second recurrent theme is self-control, in general holding oneself inward when it comes to speaking, eating and [[fart|bodily emissions]]. When it comes to speaking, "Be careful to whom, what, why and when you speak". He suggests it is better to keep your thoughts to yourself. When it comes to eating, he suggests small bites, not overeating, not playing with food, no using fingers to clean bowls. Also, guests and servants should not urinate in the dining hall, but the host may.

The third recurrent theme is [[sexual morality]]. The ''Civilized Man'' was clearly written for men. It offers advice on [[prostitute]]s: "If you are overcome with erotic desire when you are young and your penis drives you to go to a prostitute, do not go to a common whore; empty your testicles quickly and depart quickly." He offers advice on how to pick a wife, which includes looking at her property value and personal traits. Following a tradition inherited from antiquity, Daniel describes women as lustful and untrustworthy. The poem describes a woman lying in bed with her husband, with her thoughts on to her secret lover: "The lascivious woman throws herself around the neck of her lover, her fingers give him those secret touches that she denies to her husband in bed; one wicked act with her lover pleases the lascivious adulteress more than a hundred with her husband; women's minds always burn for the forbidden." He says she is always ready to fornicate "with a cook or a half-wit, a peasant or a ploughman, or a chaplain... what she longs for is a thick, leaping, robust piece of equipment, long, smooth and stiff... such are the things that charm and delight women". Daniel had a nearly pathological view of the promiscuity of women, but despite this he says "Whatever your wife does, do not damage your marriage" and he goes on to say "if you are jealous, do not whisper a word about it... when you are jealous, learn to look up at the ceiling." The message is clearly in the same theme of holding inward and avoiding any embarrassments at all cost.

Daniel's advice comes to a climax in what is perhaps the most difficult situation of all: the wife of one's lord makes a sexual proposition. It is a combination of the three problems: hierarchical relationships, control of bodily emissions, and sexual morality. Daniel's solution? Pretend to be ill.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11634">In contemporary philosophy, a '''brute fact''' is a fact that has no explanation.&lt;ref&gt;Ludwig Fahrbach. "Understanding brute facts," ''Synthese'' 145 (3):449 - 466 (2005).&lt;/ref&gt;  More narrowly, brute facts may instead be defined as those facts which cannot be explained (as opposed to simply having no explanation).&lt;ref&gt;John Hospers, ''An Introduction to Philosophical Analysis'' (1997) p. 211&lt;/ref&gt; To reject the existence of brute facts is to think that everything can be explained. ("Everything can be explained" is sometimes called [[the principle of sufficient reason]]). There are two ways to explain something: say what "brought it about", or describe it at a more "fundamental" level.{{cn|date=March 2016}} For example, a cat displayed on a computer screen can be explained, more "fundamentally", as there being certain voltages in bits of metal in the screen, which in turn can be explained, more "fundamentally", as certain subatomic particles moving in a certain manner. If we keep explaining the world in this way and reach a point at which no more "deeper" explanations can be given, then we would have found some facts which are brute or inexplicable, in the sense that we {{cns|text=cannot give them an ''[[Ontology|ontological]] explanation''|date=March 2016}}. As it might be put, there may exist some things that just ''are''. The same thing can be done with ''[[causal explanation]]s''. If nothing made the [[Big Bang]] expand at the velocity it did, then this is a brute fact in the sense that it lacks a causal explanation.

==Brute/scientific fact==

[[Henri Poincaré]] distinguished between brute facts and their scientific descriptions, pointing to how the conventional nature of the latter always remained constrained by the brute fact in question.&lt;ref&gt;Gary Gutting, ''French Philosophy in the Twentieth Century'' (2001) p. 32&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pierre Duhem]] argued that just as there may be several scientific descriptions of the same brute fact, so too there may be many brute facts with the same scientific description.&lt;ref&gt;Gutting, p. 34&lt;/ref&gt;

==Anscombe==
{{multiple issues|section=y|{{unclear|section|reason (editor version)=need a good rewrite; and stop "heavy-lifting" Anscombe's words without adding furthur elaboration/explanation; Anscombe's explanations has a tendency to be digressing and "naggy" (as contrasted with razor-sharp reductionism) in a confusing way|date=March 2016}}{{refimprove |section|date=March 2016}}}}
[[G. E. M. Anscombe]] wrote about how facts can be brute relative to other facts. Simply put, some facts cannot be reducible to other facts, such that if some set of facts holds true, it does not entail the fact brute relative to it.{{cn|date=March 2016}}

The example she uses is that of someone owing a grocer money for supplying them with potatoes. In such a case, the set of facts, e.g. that the customer asked for the potatoes, that the grocer supplied them with the potatoes, etc., does not necessarily entail that the customer owes the grocer money. After all, this could all have transpired on the set of a film as a bit of acting, in which case the customer would not ''actually'' owe anything.{{cn|date=March 2016}}

One might argue that if the institutional context is taken into account, putatively brute facts ''can'' be reduced to constituent facts. That is, in the context of something like the institution of a market, a customer ordering potatoes, etc. would entail that they owe the grocer compensation equal to the service that was provided. While Anscombe does acknowledge that an institutional context is necessary for a particular description to make sense, it does not necessarily follow that a particular set of facts holding true in an institutional context entails the fact brute relative to it. To wit, if the example is indeed considered in the institutional context necessary for descriptions of 'owing', it could still be the case that the customer does not owe the grocer, per the counterexample of a film production. This fundamental ambiguity is essentially what makes a fact brute relative to other facts.{{cn|date=March 2016}}

That being said, Anscombe does argue that under normal circumstance, such a fact ''is'' actually entailed. That is, if it is true that a customer requested potatoes, etc., then ''under normal circumstances'' the customer would indeed owe the grocer money. However, because such entailment is conditional on such a set of facts holding true under a particular set of circumstances, the fact entailed is still fundamentally brute relative to such facts, just that in such a case the leap in inference occurs at the level of the circumstances, not that of the facts themselves.{{cn|date=March 2016}}

Finally, if a fact brute relative to other facts holds true, it follows that some set of facts it is brute relative to is also true, e.g. if the customer owes the grocer money, then it follows that the grocer supplied them with potatoes. After all, had they not done so, then the customer would not owe them money. As such, given some fact brute relative to other facts, there is a range of facts, such that a set of them will hold if the fact brute relative to them also holds. That being said, Anscombe argues that the full range of facts that some fact can be brute relative to cannot be known exhaustively. The rough range can be sketched out with relevant, paradigmatic examples, but the full range of such facts cannot be known, as one can theoretically always suppose a new special context that changes the range.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Anscombe|first1=G.E.M.|authorlink1=On Brute Facts|title=The Collected Philosophical Papers of G. E. M. Anscombe|volume=Volume III: Ethics, Religion and Politics|date=1981|publisher=Blackwell|location=Oxford|isbn=0-631-12942-1|pages=22-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Searle==

[[John Searle]] developed Anscombe's concept of brute facts into what he called brute physical facts—such as that snow is on Mt. Everest—as opposed to social or institutional facts, dependent for their existence on human agreement.&lt;ref&gt;Searle, p. 121 and p. 1-2&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, he considered money to be an institutional fact, which nevertheless rested ultimately on a brute physical fact, whether a piece of paper or only an electronic record.

Searle thought that the pervasiveness of social facts could disguise their [[Social constructivism|social construction]] and ultimate reliance upon the brute fact: thus, we are for example trained from infancy (in his words) to see "cellulose fibres with green and gray stains, or enamel-covered iron concavities containing water...[as] dollar bills, and full bathtubs".&lt;ref&gt;Searle, p. 56 and p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;

==Opposition==
The [[principle of sufficient reason]] is sometimes understood to entail that there are no brute facts.

According to the Principle of Sufficient Reason all facts must have an explanation and this seems to exclude brute facts. But the truth of this principle is not accepted by all. After all, if no brute facts exist, how are fundamental laws possible? One could argue that the principle of sufficient reason is true a priori but that is something that has famously been disputed by David Hume.

==Vintiadis==
In 2018 Elly Vintiadis edited a collection of papers on brute facts that is the first systematic exploration of bruteness and which includes original papers by a number of philosophers and scientists. The collection focuses on physical, emergent and modal brute facts rather than social facts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1034594829|title=Brute facts|date=2018|publisher=Oxford University Press|last=Vintiadis|first=Elly|last2=Mekios|first2=Constantinos|isbn=9780191818523|edition=1st|location=New York, NY|oclc=1034594829}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vintiadis argues that a properly understood naturalistic attitude requires that we accept the existence of ontological brute facts and also, possibly, emergent brute facts.

Beyond the initial definition given above of brute facts as facts that that do not have explanations, there is a distinction drawn by Eric Barnes (1994) between epistemically brute facts and ontologically brute facts. The former are for which we do not have an explanation, they are brute for us (e.g., Vintiadis cites the fact that gases behave in a manner described by the Boyle-Charles law was an epistemologically brute fact until its explanation in terms of the kinetic theory of gases). The latter, ontologically brute facts are facts for which there is no explanation in virtue of the way the world is (e.g., the fundamental laws of physics). Which facts we accept as ontologically brute though depends on what kind of theory of explanation we accept (e.g. the properties of fundamental particles will be brute facts under a mereological view of explanation, but a fundamental law will be brute under a covering law model of explanation).

==Brute Necessities==
{{unreferenced section|date=October 2018}}
John Heil has argued that brute facts can only be contingent facts, since otherwise asking for an explanation for something that couldn’t be otherwise doesn’t make sense. Joseph Levine agrees with this since for him explanation means removing different possibilities. But not all agree, because some philosophers argue that it is a natural question to ask why some things are necessary.{{who|date=October 2018}} For instance philosopher James Van Cleve believes that brute necessities cannot be excluded.

==Infinitism==
{{unreferenced section|date=October 2018}}
According to explanatory infinitism, the chain of explanations goes on infinitely and there is no fundamental explanation. This, then, is another way of objecting to the existence of explanatory brute facts, but also metaphysical brute facts, if bruteness is understood in terms of ontological independence.

The '''bypass ratio (BPR)''' of a [[turbofan]] engine is the ratio between the mass flow rate of the bypass stream to the mass flow rate entering the core.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.britannica.com/technology/bypass-ratio&lt;/ref&gt; A 10:1 bypass ratio, for example, means that 10&amp;nbsp;kg of air passes through the bypass duct for every 1&amp;nbsp;kg of air passing through the core.

Turbofan engines are usually described in terms of bpr, which together with [[engine pressure ratio]], turbine inlet temperature and fan pressure ratio are important design parameters. In addition bpr is quoted for [[turboprop]] and [[unducted fan]] installations because their high propulsive efficiency gives them the overall efficiency characteristics of very high bypass turbofans. This allows them to be shown together with turbofans on plots which show trends of reducing sfc (specific fuel consumption) with increasing bpr. Bpr is also quoted for lift fan installations where the fan airflow is remote from the engine and doesn't physically touch the engine core.

Bypass provides a lower fuel consumption for the same thrust, measured as [[thrust specific fuel consumption]] (grams/second fuel per unit of thrust in kN using [[SI units]]). Lower fuel consumption that comes with high bypass ratios applies to [[turboprop]]s, using a [[Propeller (aeronautics)|propeller]] rather than a ducted fan.&lt;ref name=kroo/&gt;&lt;ref name=Spak/&gt;&lt;ref name=nag/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.animatedengines.com/jets.html Animated Engines]&lt;/ref&gt; High bypass designs are the dominant type for commercial passenger aircraft and both civilian and military jet transports.

Business jets use medium bpr engines.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.abcm.org.br/anais/cobem/2013/PDF/1874.pdf# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2016-12-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170516163516/http://www.abcm.org.br/anais/cobem/2013/PDF/1874.pdf# |archive-date=2017-05-16 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Combat aircraft use engines with '''low bypass''' ratios to compromise between fuel economy and the requirements of combat: high [[power-to-weight ratio]]s, supersonic performance, and the ability to use [[afterburners]].

==Principles==
If all the gas power from a gas turbine is converted to kinetic energy in a propelling nozzle, the aircraft is best suited to high supersonic speeds. If it is all transferred to a separate big mass of air with low kinetic energy, the aircraft is best suited to zero speed (hovering). For speeds in between, the gas power is shared between a separate airstream and the gas turbine's own nozzle flow in a proportion which gives the aircraft performance required. The first jet aircraft were subsonic and the poor suitability of the propelling nozzle for these speeds due to high fuel consumption was understood, and bypass proposed, as early as 1936 (U.K. Patent 471,368).  
The underlying principle behind bypass is trading exhaust velocity for extra mass flow which still gives the required thrust but uses less fuel. [[Frank Whittle]] called it "gearing down the flow".&lt;ref&gt;Gas Turbine Aerodynamics, Sir Frank Whittle, Pergamon Press 1981, p.217&lt;/ref&gt; Power is transferred from the gas generator to an extra mass of air, i.e. a bigger diameter propelling jet, moving more slowly. The bypass spreads the available mechanical power across more air to reduce the velocity of the jet.&lt;ref&gt;Aircraft Engine Design Second Edition, Mattingley, Heiser, Pratt, AIAA Education Series, {{ISBN|1-56347-538-3}}, p.539&lt;/ref&gt; The trade off between mass flow and velocity is also seen with propellers and helicopter rotors by comparing disc loading and power loading.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1964/1964%20-%202596.html&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the same helicopter weight can be supported by a high power engine and small diameter rotor or, for less fuel, a lower power engine and bigger rotor with lower velocity through the rotor.

Bypass usually refers to transferring gas power from a gas turbine to a bypass stream of air to reduce fuel consumption and jet noise. Alternatively, there may be a requirement for an afterburning engine where the sole requirement for bypass is to provide cooling air. This sets the lower limit for bpr and these engines have been called "leaky" or continuous bleed turbojets&lt;ref&gt;Jane's All The World's Aircraft 1975-1976, edited by John W.R. Taylor, Jane's Yearbooks, Paulton House, 8 Sheperdess Walk, London N1 7LW, p.748&lt;/ref&gt; (General Electric YJ-101 bpr 0.25) and low bpr turbojets&lt;ref&gt;http://proceedings.asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/proceeding.aspx?articleid=2275853&lt;/ref&gt; (Pratt &amp; Whitney PW1120). Low bpr (0.2) has also been used to provide surge margin as well as afterburner cooling for the [[Pratt &amp; Whitney J58]].&lt;ref&gt;http://roadrunnersinternationale.com/pw_tales.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
[[File:Gas turbine efficiency.png|thumb|upright=1.4|Propulsive efficiency comparison for various gas turbine engine configurations]]

In a zero-bypass (turbojet) engine the high temperature and high pressure exhaust gas is accelerated by expansion through a [[propelling nozzle]] and  produces all the thrust. The compressor absorbs all the mechanical power produced by the turbine. In a bypass design extra turbines drive a [[ducted fan]] that accelerates air rearward from the front of the engine. In a high-bypass design, the ducted fan and nozzle produce most of the thrust. Turbofans are closely related to [[turboprop]]s in principle because both transfer some of the gas turbine's gas power, using extra machinery, to a bypass stream leaving less for the hot nozzle to convert to kinetic energy. Turbofans represent an intermediate stage between [[turbojet]]s, which derive all their thrust from exhaust gases, and turbo-props which derive minimal thrust from exhaust gases (typically 10% or less).&lt;ref name=srm&gt;"[http://www.srmuniv.ac.in/downloads/turbofan-2012.pdf The turbofan engine] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150418181832/http://www.srmuniv.ac.in/downloads/turbofan-2012.pdf# |date=2015-04-18 }}", page 7. ''[[SRM Institute of Science and Technology]], Department of aerospace engineering''&lt;/ref&gt; Extracting shaft power and transferring it to a bypass stream introduces extra losses which are more than made up by the improved propulsive efficiency. The turboprop at its best flight speed gave significant fuel savings over a turbojet even though an extra turbine, a gearbox and a propeller were added to the turbojet's low-loss propelling nozzle.&lt;ref&gt;Gas Turbine Theory Second Edition, Cohen, Rogers and Saravanamuttoo, Longmans Group Limited 1972, {{ISBN|0 582 44927 8}}, p.85&lt;/ref&gt; The turbofan has additional losses from its extra turbines, fan, bypass duct and extra propelling nozzle compared to the turbojet's single nozzle.

To see the influence of increasing bpr alone on overall efficiency in the aircraft, i.e. sfc, a common gas generator has to be used, i.e. no change in Brayton cycle parameters or component efficiencies. Bennett&lt;ref&gt;Aero Engine Development for the Future, H.W. Bennett, Proc Instn Mech Engrs Vol 197A, Power Industries Division, July 1983, Fig.5&lt;/ref&gt; shows in this case a relatively slow rise in losses transferring power to the bypass at the same time as a fast drop in exhaust losses with a significant improvement in sfc. In reality increases in bpr over time come along with rises in gas generator efficiency masking, to some extent, the influence of bpr.

Only the limitations of weight and materials (e.g., the strengths and melting points of materials in the turbine) reduce the efficiency at which a turbofan gas turbine converts this thermal energy into mechanical energy, for while the exhaust gases may still have available energy to be extracted, each additional stator and turbine disk retrieves progressively less mechanical energy per unit of weight, and increasing the [[compression ratio]] of the system by adding to the compressor stage to increase overall system efficiency increases temperatures at the turbine face. Nevertheless, high-bypass engines have a high [[propulsive efficiency]] because even slightly increasing the velocity of a very large volume and consequently mass of air produces a very large change in momentum and thrust: thrust is the engine's mass flow (the amount of air flowing through the engine) multiplied by the difference between the inlet and exhaust velocities in—a linear relationship—but the kinetic energy of the exhaust is the mass flow multiplied by one-half the square of the difference in velocities.&lt;ref name=bevil&gt;[[Paul Bevilaqua]] : [http://www.dtic.mil/dticasd/sbir/sbir032/n184.doc The shaft driven Lift Fan propulsion system for the Joint Strike Fighter] page 3.

Quote: "It has better fuel consumption than a turbojet or turbofan, due to a high propulsive efficiency.., achieving thrust by a high mass flow of air from the propeller at low jet velocity. Above 0.6 Mach number the turboprop in turn becomes uncompetitive, due mainly to higher weight and frontal area."&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Rolls-Royce Limited|Rolls–Royce]] [[Rolls-Royce Conway|Conway]] [[turbofan]] engine, developed in the early 1950s, was an early example of a bypass engine. The configuration was similar to a 2-spool turbojet but to make it into a bypass engine it was equipped with an oversized low pressure compressor: the flow through the inner portion of the compressor blades went into the core while the outer portion of the blades blew air around the core to provide the rest of the thrust. The bypass ratio for the Conway varied between 0.3 and 0.6 depending on the variant&lt;ref&gt;"Rolls-Royce Aero Engines" Bill Gunston, Patrick Stevens Limited, {{ISBN|1-85260-037-3}}, p.147&lt;/ref&gt;

The growth of bypass ratios during the 1960s gave [[Jet airliner|jetliners]] fuel efficiency that could compete with that of piston-powered planes.
Today (2015), most jet engines have some bypass. Modern engines in slower aircraft, such as airliners, have bypass ratios up to 12:1; in higher-speed aircraft, such as [[fighter aircraft|fighters]], bypass ratios are much lower, around 1.5; and craft designed for speeds up to Mach 2 and somewhat above have bypass ratios below 0.5.

'''Children's use of information''' is an issue in [[ethics]] and [[child development]]. Information is learned from many different sources and '''source monitoring''' (see also [[source-monitoring error]]) is important in understanding how people use information and decide which information is [[credibility|credible]]. Consider the example of a parent whose child has been diagnosed with [[hyperactivity]]; the parent searches the internet for information, reads books, participates in an online chat room with other parents in the same situation, and consults various medical professionals. Some of these sources will be credible (contain reliable information), and others will not. To be well-informed, the parent must filter information according to the reliability of the source.

Children learn about the world in much the same way. They are told things by numerous people (e.g., teachers, parents, siblings, and friends), see things on the television or internet, and read information in books. Can children be effective consumers of information? At what age are they able to do this? How do they deal with ambiguous resources? This page will detail answers to those questions (and others) by drawing on peer-reviewed scientific research.

==The development of source monitoring==
Young children have more difficulty with understanding and recalling the sources of information than adults do.&lt;ref name="Lindsay, D. S. 1991"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lindsay | first1 = D. S. | last2 = Johnson | first2 = M. K. | last3 = Kwon | first3 = P. | year = 1991 | title = Developmental changes in memory source monitoring | url = | journal = Journal of Experimental Child Psychology | volume = 52 | issue = 3| pages = 297–318 | doi=10.1016/0022-0965(91)90065-z | pmid=1770330}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although [[episodic memory]] improves throughout childhood, development in the area of source monitoring tends to occur between the ages of 3 and 8 years.&lt;ref name = "Roberts 2002"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Roberts | first1 = K. P. | year = 2002 | title = Children's ability to distinguish between memories from multiple sources: Implications for the quality and accuracy of eyewitness statements | url = | journal = Developmental Review | volume = 22 | issue = 3| pages = 403–435 | doi = 10.1016/S0273-2297(02)00005-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At 3 years, children who are able to immediately recognize the source of the information they obtain have difficulty recalling this information after a short delay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gopnik | first1 = A. | last2 = Graf | first2 = P. | year = 1988 | title = Knowing how you know: Young children's ability to identify and remember the sources of their beliefs | url = | journal = Child Development | volume = 59 | issue = 5| pages = 1366–1371 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-8624.1988.tb01505.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The development of source monitoring is gradual, and children achieve and display competency in certain aspects of source monitoring before others.&lt;ref name = "Roberts 2002"/&gt; The developmental trajectory of source monitoring provides insight into what cognitive factors are necessary prerequisites. While there is no generally accepted unified theory for the development of source monitoring, five major theories contribute ideas about how source monitoring develops in children: source monitoring theory, [[fuzzy-trace theory]], [[schema theory]], person-based perspective, and the mental-state reasoning model.

===Source monitoring theory===
According to source monitoring theory, the source of information is attributed through a decision-making process, where source is inferred based on various characteristics inherent in the memory itself.&lt;ref name="Lindsay, D. S. 1991"/&gt; This means that the sources are not directly [[Encoding (memory)|encoded]], but rather [[Reconstructive memory|reconstructed]], when information is recalled. This decision-making process can either be through automatic, unconscious processing, or through heightened demanding and systematic processing that may require reasoning, and the retrieval of supporting memories. This theory implicates the development of episodic memory and memory strategies in the development of source monitoring more generally.

===Fuzzy-trace theory===
{{see also|Fuzzy-trace theory}}
Fuzzy-trace theory hypothesizes that the source-monitoring errors that children make are caused by problems with memory [[Storage (memory)|storage]] and [[Recall (memory)|retrieval]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Brainerd | first1 = C. J. | last2 = Reyna | first2 = V. F. | year = 1990 | title = Gist is the grist: Fuzzy-trace theory and the new intuitionism | url = | journal = Developmental Review | volume = 10 | issue = 1| pages = 3–47 | doi=10.1016/0273-2297(90)90003-m}}&lt;/ref&gt; Memories are simultaneously stored in two different formats: the "gist" level (extracted from the experience), and the "verbatim" representation (information in exact detail). It is proposed that the source of information is encoded in memory as a verbatim detail. Memories for verbatim details decay more quickly over time than gist representations, and young children demonstrate faster decay of verbatim information than older children or adults. Younger children are more likely to experience memory intrusions due to weaker memory traces, which leads to a susceptibility to misleading information replacing memory traces from a previous event.&lt;ref name="welch-ross1997"/&gt; For this reason, developmental changes in episodic memory performance are viewed as the driving factor in source monitoring development.

===Schema theory===
{{see also|Schema (psychology)}}
Schema theory, as a derivative of [[script theory]], states that after repeated exposure to similar events, individuals form a general representation of what typically happens.&lt;ref&gt;Farrar, M. J., &amp; Goodman, G. S. (1990). Developmental differences in the relation between scripts and episodic memory: Do they exist? In Knowing and remembering in young children, Fivush, Robyn, Hudson, Judith A. eds., (pp. 30-64). Cambridge University Press, New York, NY&lt;/ref&gt; Some details are the same at each instance of repeated events, and others can vary from instance to instance. In the script for what usually happens, there is a "slot" for each variable detail and the detail for a particular time is chosen from a list of possible variations. If source information is encoded as a slot, errors in source monitoring can be the result of incorrect retrieval of a specific detail. This framework allows for the storage of a large amount of detailed information about specific events, however is very cognitively demanding for children. Because of their limited cognitive resources, young children require more experience with repeated events in order to generate a schema. Details that vary from instance to instance can be lost, and children rely instead on the generalized event representation when attempting to recall a particular instance. The main assumption is that the development of source monitoring depends on an increase in cognitive processing capacity.

===Person-based perspective===
Person-based perspective emphasizes [[Prospective memory|prospective processes]]. Prospective processes relate actions to one another through operations such as sequencing and planning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ratner | first1 = H. H. | last2 = Foley | first2 = M. A. | year = 1996 | title = A unifying framework for the development of children's activity memory | url = | journal = Advances in Child Development and Behavior | volume = 25 | issue = | pages = 33–105 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These processes are affected by the perspective taken (self vs. other) or the goals and meaning to the individual. The meaning attached to the goal of an action can interfere with source monitoring by removing attention from the source details.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Foley | first1 = M. A. | last2 = Ratner | first2 = H. H. | year = 1998 | title = Distinguishing between memories for thoughts and deeds: The role of prospective processing in children's source monitoring | url = | journal = British Journal of Developmental Psychology | volume = 16 | issue = 4| pages = 465–484 | doi=10.1111/j.2044-835x.1998.tb00765.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The person-based perspective is social-cognitive in nature (more so than other theories of source monitoring) and assumes that development is reliant on socialization and [[theory of mind]] development.

===Mental-state reasoning model===
The mental-state reasoning model highlights possible mechanisms behind young children's suggestibility.&lt;ref&gt;Welch-Ross, M. (2000). A mental-state reasoning model of suggestibility and memory source monitoring. In Children's source monitoring, Roberts, Kim P., Blades, Mark, eds., (pp. 227-255). Lawrence Erlbaum Associates Publishers, Mahwah, NJ&lt;/ref&gt; Children who have difficulty with reasoning about conflicting [[mental representation]]s are likely to overwrite their original memories with misinformation because they cannot reconcile two contradicting views of what actually occurred.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bright-Paul | first1 = A. | last2 = Jarrold | first2 = C. | last3 = Wright | first3 = D. B. | year = 2008 | title = Theory of mind development influences suggestibility and source monitoring | doi = 10.1037/0012-1649.44.4.1055 | journal = Developmental Psychology | volume = 44 | issue = | pages = 1055–1068 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Source monitoring and the understanding of knowledge states, play a key role in resisting suggestions. The development of source monitoring is presumed to be based on better understanding of knowledge states, [[metacognition]] and theory of mind.

==The origins of knowledge==
Being aware of how we have acquired information is particularly difficult for young children (specifically 3 to 5 year-olds). After feeling a soft ball, 3 and 4 year-olds can correctly identify whether they know the ball is soft or hard, but cannot always say how they know. Perhaps it is because they felt the ball, saw the ball, or were told it was soft. The ability to recognize the origin of their knowledge requires the understanding of how knowledge is acquired.&lt;ref name = "O'Neill 1992"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = O'Neill | first1 = D. K. | last2 = Astington | first2 = J. W. | last3 = Flavell | first3 = J. H. | year = 1992 | title = Young children's understanding of the role that sensory experiences play in knowledge acquisition | url = | journal = Child Development | volume = 63 | issue = | pages = 474–490 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-8624.1992.tb01641.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Knowledge and justification===
When asked '''knowledge questions''' ("Do you know what is in the box?") then '''justification questions''' ("How do [or why don't] you know what is in the box?"), children who can correctly answer are able to reflect on knowledge that they have gained from a particular source and should be able to identify the source of information.&lt;ref name = "O'Neill 1992"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Wimmer 1988"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wimmer | first1 = H. | last2 = Hogrefe | first2 = | last3 = Perner | first3 = J. | year = 1988 | title = Children's understanding of informational access as source of knowledge | url = | journal = Child Development | volume = 59 | issue = | pages = 386–396 | doi=10.2307/1130318}}&lt;/ref&gt;

3 and 4 year-olds are better at answering these questions when the questions refer to themselves in comparison to referring to another person. When these children are shown a hidden object they can correctly report their perceptual access (responding correctly to "Did you look into the box?") and their knowledge access of what is in the box (responding correctly to "Do you know [not know] what is in the box?").&lt;ref name = "Wimmer 1988"/&gt; Despite their ability to answer correctly when referring to the self, 3 and 4 year-olds have difficulty responding to the "other's" knowledge, where they deny the "other" has the knowledge. 3-4 year-olds can correctly identify that the other person has in fact looked in a box, but when asked "Does [other] know what is in the box?" the child will deny that the other person knows what is in the box.&lt;ref name = "Wimmer 1988"/&gt; The key assumption is then that although children are aware that perceptual access is needed, they are unable to acknowledge that the knowledge was gained from perceptual access.&lt;ref name = "Wimmer 1988"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pratt | first1 = C. | last2 = Bryant | first2 = P. | year = 1990 | title = Young children understand that looking leads to knowing (so long as they are looking into a single barrel) | url = | journal = Child Development | volume = 61 | issue = | pages = 973–982 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-8624.1990.tb02835.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gaining knowledge through looking, touching, and asking===
Gaining knowledge is knowing how to acquire new information. The ability to recognize how specific knowledge can be gained by perceptual access (looking, feeling or smelling) is the understanding of Aspectuality. '''Aspectuality''' understanding is the awareness that an object is made up of many different properties (colour, weight, odour), which can be determined by a specific perceptual action (looking, feeling, smelling).&lt;ref name = "O'Neill 1992"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Waters 2012"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Waters | first1 = G. M. | last2 = Beck | first2 = S. R. | year = 2012 | title = How should we question young children's understanding of aspectuality? | url = | journal = The British Journal of Developmental Psychology | volume = 30 | issue = | pages = 376–392 | doi = 10.1111/j.2044-835X.2011.02044.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; Identifying the colour of a car outside the window could involve asking someone for the information or looking out the window. In most cases, adults would acquire this knowledge from simply looking out the window. However, not all information can be gained in this manner. If you were asked to find out how old the driver of the car is, simply looking would not provide accurate information; you would have to ask. These two situations are dependent on whether the information being sought out is visible or invisible (respectively).&lt;ref name = "Fitneva 2013"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fitneva | first1 = S. A. | last2 = Lam | first2 = N. H. L. | last3 = Dunfield | first3 = K. A. | year = 2013 | title = The development of children's information gathering: To look or to ask? | url = | journal = Developmental Psychology | volume = 49 | issue = | pages = 533–542 | doi = 10.1037/a0031326 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Knowledge development depends on children's ability to efficiently pursue their informational goal. Children do not always make the most effective or efficient decision when acquiring new information.&lt;ref name = "Fitneva 2013"/&gt;

====Age differences====
6 year-olds are able to distinguish when gaining knowledge requires looking (the information is visible) or when gaining knowledge requires asking (the information is invisible). However, 4 year-olds do not perform as consistently. Even with an [[expert]] present, 4 year-olds will [[estimation|overestimate]] the knowledge they can gain through looking. However, when the information to be gained is regarding a group of friends and the expert is a friend of the group, 4 year-olds tend to overestimate knowledge acquisition through asking.&lt;ref name = "Fitneva 2013"/&gt;

When given access to pairs of objects, which could either be identified by seeing (identical objects: different in colour) or by touch/feeling (identical objects: 1 soft, 1 hard), children perform relatively well, generally recognizing when they have adequate information and when they have inadequate information (i.e., knowing the object is blue after seeing it or knowing the object is soft after feeling it).&lt;ref name = "O'Neill 1992"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Robinson 2008"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Robinson | first1 = E. J. | last2 = Haigh | first2 = S. N. | last3 = Pendle | first3 = J. E. C. | year = 2008 | title = Children's working understanding of the knowledge gained from seeing and feeling | url = | journal = Developmental Science | volume = 11 | issue = | pages = 299–305 | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-7687.2008.00676.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; But, when young children are not given access (of seeing or feeling), they have difficulty predicting and identifying which mode of access would allow them to identify the object.&lt;ref name = "Robinson 2008"/&gt; In this case, 3 and 4 year-olds overestimate the knowledge that could be gained through feeling the object.&lt;ref name = "O'Neill 1992"/&gt; 3 to 4 year-olds may not understand the perceptual access needed to acquire the specific knowledge.

===Language and question phrasing===
Waters and Beck (2012) state "understanding the link between perceptual access and consequent information (knowledge access) is a crucial component in the development of [[theory of mind]]". In a typical adult population, change in the phrasing of a particular question would not affect the understanding of what action needs to occur. "What colour is the bike that is outside?" or "Is the bike red?" should not change the action of ''looking'' to gain the needed information. However, children's performance is susceptible to this type of question phrasing.&lt;ref name = "Waters 2012"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Doherty | first1 = M. J. | last2 = Perner | first2 = J. | year = 1998 | title = Metalinguistic awareness and theory of mind: Just two words for the same thing? | url = | journal = Cognitive Development | volume = 13 | issue = | pages = 279–305 | doi=10.1016/s0885-2014(98)90012-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Perner | first1 = J. | last2 = Rendl | first2 = B | last3 = Garnham | first3 = A. | year = 2007 | title = Objects of desire, thought, and reality: Problems of anchoring discourse referents in development | url = | journal = Mind &amp; Language | volume = 22 | issue = | pages = 475–513 | doi=10.1111/j.1468-0017.2007.00317.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are language effects on knowledge access through 3 different question types:&lt;ref name = "Waters 2012" /&gt;

#'''Identity''': "Find out ''which one'' is in the tunnel",
#'''Dimension''': "Find out ''what colour'' the one in the tunnel is"
#'''Aspect''': "Find out if the one in the tunnel ''is the red one'' or ''the blue one''".

4 and 5 year-olds are more likely to respond correctly to aspect and dimension questions in comparison to identity questions.&lt;ref name = "Waters 2012"/&gt; Aspect and dimension questions are more explicit, which may be why performance is better in these categories. Identity questions require more cognitive effort as one has to remember how the objects were similar and how they differed.

==Judging the credibility of sources and understanding of trust==
Much of people's knowledge about the world is not obtained from direct experience, but indirectly from what other people or sources tell them. With widespread use of the internet people have access to nearly unlimited sources of information. Some of that information might be conflicting, and different sources of information vary in their accuracy and credibility. People can also deliberately [[deception|deceive]], be misunderstood, or be mistaken.&lt;ref name="Nurmsoo2009"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Nurmsoo | first1 = E. | last2 = Robinson | first2 = E. J. | year = 2009 | title = Children's trust in previously inaccurate informants who were well or poorly informed: When past errors can be excused | url = | journal = Child Development | volume = 80 | issue = | pages = 23–27 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-8624.2008.01243.x | pmid=19236390}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is important that people develop the necessary skills to assess the accuracy of what they are being told.

===Adults' credibility judgments===
Adults make credibility judgments based on two factors: expertise and trustworthiness. For example, we might trust information from published research articles more than information from blogs because we know that anyone can write a blog, but scientists (experts) who write peer-reviewed articles are highly trained. With regards to trustworthiness, adults are less likely to believe someone who they think is trying to deceive them, and they take into account the intentions of the information-provider. For example, if someone's intention is to sell you something, you might be more skeptical of the accuracy of the information they provide because their motives cause you to question their honesty. Adults can effectively use these cues to make judgments about the credibility of different sources, but whether children can also do so is an important area for research.

===Children's ability to make credibility judgments===
Even very young children show an early sensitivity to issues of source credibility. By the age of 4, children show similar patterns to adults in a preference for perception over testimony; that is, they would rather see something with their own eyes than be told about it. Children also feel more confident in their knowledge when they have directly perceived it than if they have been told by someone else, even if the speaker is well informed.&lt;ref name="Robinson2008"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Robinson | first1 = E. J. | last2 = Haigh | first2 = S. N. | last3 = Nurmsoo | first3 = E. | year = 2008 | title = Children's working understanding of knowledge sources: Confidence in knowledge gained from testimony | url = | journal = Cognitive Development | volume = 23 | issue = | pages = 105–118 | doi=10.1016/j.cogdev.2007.05.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, children are not always able to directly perceive information, and they learn much of what they know from others. Some people are more [[credibility|credible]] sources of information than others, so children must actively evaluate information and decide whether or not to believe it. There are many factors or cues that children, by the age of 4, take into consideration when making judgements about whether or not to trust what a person says. For instance, [[knowledge]] and experience, [[trait theory|traits]], [[motivation]]s, age, and reasoning or support.

====Credibility judgments based on knowledge and experience====
Young children have a reputation for [[credulity]], or believing something without having any proof that it is true. Young children often [[Trust (social sciences)|trust]] what adults tell them, especially when they have no prior knowledge or expectations about the topic of the testimony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Jaswal | first1 = V. K. | last2 = Carrington Croft | first2 = A. | last3 = Setia | first3 = A. R. | last4 = Cole | first4 = C.

In particular, 3 year-olds tendency to believe others is based on a selective bias to trust what people tell them. This selective trust is adaptive in the early years as they are learning language and their way around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Baier | first1 = A | year = 1986 | title = Trust and anti-trust | url = | journal = Ethics | volume = 96 | issue = | pages = 231–260 | doi=10.1086/292745}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Children have difficulty disregarding information provided to them, even if the source has been unreliable in the past. 3 year-olds will often continue to believe what a person tells them even after being repeatedly deceived by that person, but 4 year-olds are far better able to disregard this unreliable information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mascaro | first1 = O. | last2 = Sperber | first2 = D. | year = 2009 | title = The moral, epistemic, and mind- reading components of children's vigilance towards deception | doi = 10.1016/j.cognition.2009.05.012| journal = Cognition | volume = 112 | issue = | pages = 367–380 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Three-year-olds are better at making trust judgments when they are able to choose between two sources of knowledge, rather than deciding whether or not to believe a single person, and in this situation they are often able to choose the more reliable of two speakers.&lt;ref name="Lane2013"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lane | first1 = J.

====Credibility judgments based on traits and motivation====
Almost all human institutions (e.g., family, community, business, government) are built on a foundation of [[Trust (social sciences)|trust]].&lt;ref name="Xu2013"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Xu | first1 = F. | last2 = Evans | first2 = A.

(1999). Selected philosophical works. Indianapolis, IN: Hackett Publishing Company, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; There are various schools of philosophical thought that posits honesty to be morally right and lying to be morally wrong. On one end of the continuum, philosophers like Bok,&lt;ref&gt;Bok, S. (1978). Lying: Moral choice in public and private life. New York, NY: Random House.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]],&lt;ref&gt;Kant, I. (1949). On a supposed right to lie from altruistic motives. In L.W. Beck (Ed.), Critical of practical reason and other writings (pp.346–350). Chicago, IL: University of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and St. Augustine&lt;ref&gt;Augustine, St. (1952). Treaties on various issues. Washington, DC: Catholic University of America Press.&lt;/ref&gt; hold a [[Deontological ethics|deontological]] view that focuses on intrinsic duties relating to the treatment of others. In other words, telling the truth is intrinsically right and lying is intrinsically wrong. On the other end of the continuum is the [[Utilitarianism|utilitarian]] view that emphasizes the greater good, specifically with respect to the outcome of one's act. Therefore, lying and its moral implications are context dependent.&lt;ref&gt;see for example, Austin, J. L. (1962). How to do things with words. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; In some situations, such as when being polite to spare another person's feelings, making a "prosocial lie" or deliberate false statement are endorsed.

Children consider motivation, as well as traits, when deciding who to seek information from and who to believe. In both Eastern and Western cultures, both adults and children adhere to the utilitarian perspective when giving moral evaluations of truths and lies in different social situations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = See | first1 = | last2 = Fu | first2 = G. | last3 = Evans | first3 = A. D. | last4 = Wang | first4 = L. | last5 = Lee | first5 = K. | year = 2008 | title = Lying in the name of collective good: A developmental study | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-7687.2008.00695.x | journal = Developmental Science | volume = 11 | issue = | pages = 495–503 | pmc = 2570108 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of people's characteristics, children tend to place trust in people who are honest, smart, or [[Kindness|kind]] over people who are dishonest, not smart, or not kind.&lt;ref name="Lane2013" /&gt; However, they also consider a person's intent or [[motivation]]. From age 7, children consider both [[honesty]] and [[wikt:benevolence|benevolence]] when making trust judgments about other people, and older children are more likely to trust people who tell prosocial lies (to avoid hurting another person's feelings or to help another person) than young children.&lt;ref name="Xu2013" /&gt; For younger children, honesty is more important than a person's intention. As children get older, they increasingly attend to motivation as a key factor. The relationship between telling the truth and trusting a person is stable, but when it comes to lying, children consider the motivation of the speaker when deciding whether or not to trust them.

====Credibility judgments based on age and reliability====
Children evaluate the [[credibility]] of a speaker by evaluating how reliable that person has been in the past and can make predictions about a speaker based on their age.&lt;ref name="Jaswal2006"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Jaswal | first1 = V. K. | last2 = Neely | first2 = L. A. | year = 2006 | title = Adults don't always know best: Preschoolers use past reliability over age when learning new words | url = | journal = Psychological Science | volume = 17 | issue = | pages = 757–758 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-9280.2006.01778.x | pmid=16984291}}&lt;/ref&gt; Children as young as 3 years-old prefer to trust an unfamiliar adult rather than an unfamiliar child.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Taylor | first1 = M. | last2 = Cartwright | first2 = B.S. | last3 = Bowden | first3 = T. | year = 1991 | title = Perspective taking and theory of mind: Do children predict interpretive diversity as a function of differences in observers' knowledge? | url = | journal = Child Development | volume = 62 | issue = | pages = 1334–1351 | doi=10.2307/1130810}}&lt;/ref&gt; When considering both age and reliability, age is often the primary cue used to determine another's credibility. For example, 3 and 4 year-olds found adults to be more trustworthy than peers, unless the peer demonstrated greater reliability (i.e., adult incorrectly mislabelled objects, whereas peer correctly labelled them).&lt;ref name="Jaswal2006" /&gt; Children also consider both the prior history of accuracy and the level of perceptual access the speaker has when they provide information. Young children spontaneously keep track of the prior history of a person's accuracy or inaccuracy (reliability) and prefer to learn from someone with a good track record.&lt;ref name="Birch2008" /&gt; Children commonly interpret the speaker's history of inaccuracy as a lasting trait and so the speaker is considered an unreliable informant, at least within the domain they have been wrong about. However, under certain conditions, children may excuse a person's past inaccuracy and later [[Trust (social sciences)|trust]] that person for information. If a speaker has limited information (e.g., lack of perceptual access) in making a claim – for example, inaccurately identifying a toy while blindfolded – then children as young as 3 years-old appropriately excuse their past inaccuracy especially when they are later well-informed.&lt;ref name="Nurmsoo2009" /&gt; On the other hand, if a speaker has full access to information while making an inaccurate claim, children continue to regard him/her as unreliable.

====Credibility judgments based on reasoning or support====
Young children appreciate that people generally think and act sensibly when reasons are present, and they can evaluate a claim by assessing the quality of the reasoning provided.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wellman | first1 = H. M. | last2 = Bartsch | first2 = K. | year = 1988 | title = Young children's reasoning about beliefs | doi = 10.1016/0010-0277(88)90021-2 | journal = Cognition | volume = 30 | issue = | pages = 239–277 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, children create an epistemic profile of a person based on the quality of the reasons they offer when making a claim.&lt;ref name="Koenig2012"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Koenig | first1 = M. A. | year = 2012 | title = Beyond semantic accuracy: Preschoolers evaluate a speaker's reasons | url = | journal = Child Development | volume = 83 | issue = | pages = 1051–1063 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-8624.2012.01742.x | pmid=22417290}}&lt;/ref&gt; As young as 3 years-old, children understand the difference between weak versus strong reasoning to support a statement. Children are more likely to [[Trust (social sciences)|trust]] someone when strong support is provided through: reliable testimony ("My teacher told me there's a book in the bag. I think that there's a book"), looking ("Before I came here, I looked and saw a ball in the bag. I think there's a ball in there"), and [[inference]] ("It's a backpack. Backpack holds books. I think there's a book in there").&lt;ref name="Koenig2012" /&gt; On the other hand, [[desire]] ("I like crayons. I want there to be crayons in the bag. I think that there are crayons in there"), pretense ("I like to pretend. I'm going to pretend that there's a sandwich in the bag. I think there's a sandwich in there"), and guessing ("I don't know. I'm going to guess that there's a toy in the bag") are not viewed as strong support for a claim.&lt;ref name="Koenig2012" /&gt; Children recognize that the mental states that they and others may hold are not always reliable means for drawing specific conclusions. 3 and 4 year-olds can also choose the more reasonable of two people and continue to seek, as well as, accept new information from the more credible person (the one who had better reasons in the past).&lt;ref name="Koenig2012" /&gt;

===Children's development of distrust===
People are not always reliable in their provision of information and it is important to be able to differentiate between good sources and bad sources. Assessing someone's reliability is based not only on the knowledgeability of the speaker, but their motives/[[intention]]s as well. People may not always be motivated to tell the [[truth]]; instead, they may potentially [[lie]] to promote their own interest,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Heyman | first1 = G. D. | last2 = Legare | first2 = C. H. | year = 2005 | title = Children's evaluation of sources of information about traits | url = | journal = Developmental Psychology | volume = 41 | issue = | pages = 636–647 | doi=10.1037/0012-1649.41.4.636 | pmid=16060810}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the interest of others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Heyman | first1 = G.

E. | last2 = Liu | first2 = D. | last3 = Heyman | first3 = G.

Beginning at 5 years-old, children use a person's prior history of deception to make reliability judgments about that person.&lt;ref name="Vanderbilt2011" /&gt;

== Metacognition ==
[[Metacognition]] is an ability that allows people to think about their own thinking process, and how to use their thinking process to help themselves learn better. Metacognition includes two separate abilities: (1) knowledge of cognition and (2) regulation of cognition.&lt;ref name="schraw1994"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schraw | first1 = G. | last2 = Dennison | first2 = R. S. | year = 1994 | title = Assessing metacognitive awareness | url = | journal = [[Contemporary Educational Psychology]] | volume = 19 | issue = | pages = 460–475 | doi=10.1006/ceps.1994.1033}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name ="brown1987"&gt;Brown, A. L. (1987). Metacognition, executive control, self-regulation, and other more mysterious mechanisms. In F. E. Weinert &amp; R. H. Kluwe (Eds.), Metacognition, motivation, and understanding (pp. 65-116). Hillsdale, New Jersey: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates.&lt;/ref&gt; Knowledge of one's thinking process is not enough to regulate an individual's behaviour, and are required to use specific strategies to help them regulate their behaviour.&lt;ref name="schraw1994" /&gt;&lt;ref name="brown1987" /&gt;

===Knowing you don't know===
An important skill children need to learn is being able to identify when a message is incomplete and they don't have enough information to make an accurate interpretation. Being aware that an ambiguous situation has arisen is difficult for young children. Children accurately "know when they know", but often overestimate when they don't know.&lt;ref name="beck2001" /&gt;&lt;ref name="robinson1982"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Robinson | first1 = E. J. | last2 = Robinson | first2 = W. P | year = 1982 | title = Knowing when you don't know enough: Children's judgments about ambiguous information | url = | journal = Cognition | volume = 12 | issue = | pages = 267–280 | doi=10.1016/0010-0277(82)90034-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Children's behaviour does not seem to match their verbal ability to acknowledge their "lack of knowledge". Despite incorrectly stating that they "know" something, children are still capable of changing their response upon hearing contradicting information to an initial interpretation and/or event.&lt;ref name="beck2001" /&gt;&lt;ref name="robinson1985"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Robinson | first1 = E. J. | last2 = Whittaker | first2 = S. J. | year = 1985 | title = Children's responses to ambiguous messages and their understanding of ambiguity | url = | journal = Developmental Psychology | volume = 21 | issue = 3| pages = 446–454 | doi=10.1037/0012-1649.21.3.446}}&lt;/ref&gt; Language plays an important role in children's accuracy in assessing their own knowledge. For children to accurately "know what they know" it is important for them to understand the various meanings of the word "know" as well as language used to describe certainty and uncertainty.&lt;ref name="mitchell1992" /&gt;&lt;ref name="moore1989"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Moore | first1 = C. Bryant | last2 = Furrow | first2 = D. | year = 1989 | title = Mental terms and the development of certainty | url = | journal = Child Development | volume = 60 | issue = 1| pages = 167–171 | doi=10.2307/1131082}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Children's judgments about ignorant and ambiguous sources===
[[Ambiguity|Ambiguous]] information is "a piece of information (word, message, or view) with multiple interpretations".&lt;ref name="beck2008"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Beck | first1 = S. R. | last2 = Robinson | first2 = E. J. | last3 = Freeth | first3 = M. M. | year = 2008 | title = Children can resist making interpretations when uncertain? | url = | journal = Journal of Experimental Child Psychology | volume = 99 | issue = | pages = 252–270 | doi=10.1016/j.jecp.2007.06.002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adults not only have the awareness to realize when ambiguity exists, but they also have strategies to deal with ambiguous input. Young children have difficulty with recognizing ambiguity and understanding how to handle it. Typically, it is not until the age of 6 or 7 that children have the ability to successfully deal with ambiguous input.&lt;ref name="beck2001"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Beck | first1 = S. R. | last2 = Robinson | first2 = E. J. | year = 2001 | title = Children's ability to make tentative interpretations of ambiguous messages | url = | journal = Journal of Experimental Child Psychology | volume = 79 | issue = | pages = 95–114 | doi=10.1006/jecp.2000.2583}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="singer1981"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Singer | first1 = J. B. | last2 = Flavell | first2 = J. H. | year = 1981 | title = Development of knowledge about communication: Children's evaluation of explicitly ambiguous messages | url = | journal = Child Development | volume = 52 | issue = 4| pages = 1211–1215 | doi=10.2307/1129508}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it seems in certain contexts with certain tasks, younger children also display some ability to deal with ambiguous information.&lt;ref name="mitchell1992"&gt;Mitchell, P . &amp; Robinson, E. J. (1992). Children's understanding of the evidential connotation of 'know' in relation to overestimation of their own knowledge, Journal of Child Language, 19, 167-182.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The role of language and prior experience===
Language can play an important role in the ability to correctly decipher ambiguous input. One can "know" someone in many different ways, for example, seeing them, talking to them, having a prior history with them, etc. This makes questions like "Do you know?" very complicated and difficult to respond to. More explicit definitions of "to know" seem to assist children in better assessing their own knowledge. Children as young as 4 years were able to make far more accurate statements about their actual knowledge when a question was phrased "Have you ''heard of''" rather than "Do you ''know''".&lt;ref name="robinson1994"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Robinson | first1 = E. J. | last2 = Mitchell | first2 = P. | year = 1994 | title = Children's judgements of ignorance on the basis of absence of experience | url = | journal = British Journal of Developmental Psychology | volume = 12 | issue = | pages = 113–129 | doi=10.1111/j.2044-835x.1994.tb00623.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the age of 6, children are typically able to accurately assess their knowledge with very little impact on their future behaviours regardless of the language used. 4-5 year-old's, on the other hand, were so susceptible to change that the phrase used altered their response to future questions. 4-5 year-old's were also less likely to overestimate their knowledge of a target person if the initial question was phrased "Have you ''heard of''" rather than "Do you ''know''".&lt;ref name="robinson1994" /&gt; Not only can responses from children be altered by the phrasing of the question, but the suggestion of lack of prior experience with the target is enough for children to change their response. In a study where children were asked if they really knew who a specific person was (between 2 pictures of people they had never seen before), they were more accurate in assessing that they ''didn't know'' when it was suggested that the target person had never been to the child's city before.&lt;ref name="robinson1994" /&gt; While experience is important, children tend not to over-rely on prior experiences and only use it when they've had significant experience that would actually assist them in assessing their knowledge.&lt;ref name= "robinson1994" /&gt;

===Partial information===
Sometimes when confronted with ambiguous information, more than one piece of information is required to make and accurate interpretation. For example, in a study where children had to pick one of four pictures presented to them after hearing ambiguous information, they were capable of making tentative interpretations and then correctly changing their interpretations upon hearing contradicting, clarifying information.&lt;ref name="beck2001" /&gt; This strategy uses multiple pieces of information and has been seen in children as young as 15 months old.&lt;ref name="ganea2007"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ganea | first1 = P. A. | last2 = Saylor | first2 = M. M. | year = 2007 | title = Infants' use of shared linguistic information to clarify ambiguous requests | url = | journal = Child Development | volume = 78 | issue = 2| pages = 493–502 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-8624.2007.01011.x | pmid=17381786}}&lt;/ref&gt; In situations where only partial information is available, young children make the best interpretation possible with the information given and go on to change this interpretation only when contradicting information emerges.&lt;ref name="robinson1982" /&gt;

===Delaying interpretation===
The presentation of clarifying information is not always immediately accessible. In these situations, adults seem to delay interpretation and seek clarifying information when appropriate. Even more difficult than acknowledging that an ambiguous situation has arisen, is children's understanding in what actions they need to take for clarification. There are 2 different types of delay in interpreting ambiguous information: one that is [[intention]]al and one that is [[instinct]]ual.&lt;ref name="beck2008" /&gt; The explicit decision to delay interpretation and seek further information is a difficult one as it involves being aware that the current information is not sufficient, and knowing how to acquire appropriate information necessary for clarification. Children are typically not successful in this process until the age of 7.&lt;ref name="beck2001" /&gt; However, when this explicit decision to delay is simplified, children aged 5 and up showed some ability in successfully choosing to delay their response.&lt;ref name="beck2008" /&gt; While the ability for intentionally delaying interpretation seems to be difficult, the ability to delay interpretation instinctively seems to be easier for young children. In one example, children were asked to stamp the correct snowman once they knew which one it was.&lt;ref name="beck2008" /&gt; Their knowledge of the correct snowman was based on a researcher slowly revealing the target snowman. The children's cards contained snowmen that differed by some feature visible on the 2nd half of the snowman only and therefore the children were required to wait until the 2nd half of the snowman was revealed in order to accurately assess which snowman was the correct one. In this scenario focusing on instinct, children as young as 5 were able to accurately delay interpretation.&lt;ref name="beck2008" /&gt; Therefore, while it is difficult for children to explicitly demonstrate their awareness of an ambiguous situation and how to resolve it, they are implicitly able to handle situations in which delaying interpretation may be beneficial.

===Referents and meaning===
It is difficult for younger children to grasp the idea that objects can be referred to in different ways and that people can have partial knowledge of the different references (i.e. a "bouncy ball" might also be referred to as a "rubber sphere"). A child might know by looking that a toy is a toy truck, but they may not be aware that the toy truck is also a present. [[Opaque context|Referential opacity]] is the concept of whether or not referring to an object changes its meaning. If something is referentially ''transparent'' (substitution insensitive), altering the [[referent]] term does not alter the meaning, and something that is referentially ''opaque'' (substitution sensitive) means that altering the referent term would alter the meaning. An example of this is a study with a puppet named Heinz.&lt;ref name="robinson2001"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Robinson | first1 = E. J. | last2 = Apperly | first2 = I. A. | year = 2001 | title = Children's difficulties with partial representations in ambiguous messages and referentially opaque contexts | url = | journal = Cognitive Development | volume = 16 | issue = | pages = 595–615 | doi=10.1016/s0885-2014(00)00035-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a ball in a box and children are told that Heinz knows that there is a ball in the box but does not know that the ball is a present. Children are then asked substitution-insensitive questions (i.e. Does Heinz know the ball is a present? – asking, "Does Heinz know the rubber sphere is a present?" ''does not'' alter the meaning of the question) and substitution sensitive questions (i.e. Does Heinz know there's a present in the box? – asking "Does Heinz know there is a rubber sphere in the box" ''does'' alter the meaning of the question). Regardless of age, substitution-''insensitive'' questions seem to be easier than substitution-''sensitive'' questions. The ability to correctly answer substitution-sensitive questions improves with age.&lt;ref name="robinson2001" /&gt; The ability to answer these types of questions is closely related to effectively evaluating ambiguous messages. Success on substitution-insensitive questions is necessary but not sufficient for success on evaluation ambiguous messages. Alternatively, success on substitution-sensitive questions is necessary and sufficient for success at evaluating ambiguous messages.&lt;ref name="robinson2001" /&gt;

=== Physical and epistemic uncertainty ===
Children can change their interpretation of information based on the context in which the interpretation is made.&lt;ref name="robinson2006"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Robinson | first1 = E. J. | last2 = Rowley | first2 = M. G. | last3 = Beck | first3 = S. R. | last4 = Carroll | first4 = D. J. | last5 = Apperly | first5 = I. A. | year = 2006 | title = Children's sensitivity to their own relative ignorance: Handling of possibilities under epistemic and physical uncertainty | url = | journal = Child Development | volume = 77 | issue = | pages = 1642–1655 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-8624.2006.00964.x | pmid=17107451}}&lt;/ref&gt; Robinson and colleagues (2006) studied children's interpretation of information in two different: physical and epistemic uncertainty. Physical uncertainty occurs when an event has not yet happened, and therefore the outcome of that event has not been determined (i.e. the dice has not yet been rolled). Epistemic uncertainty occurs when an event has already occurred, but the child is not aware of the outcome of the event (i.e. the dice have been rolled, but the dice are hidden from the participant). 4 to 8 year old children have the ability to realize multiple possibilities for an event that has not yet occurred (''physical uncertainty''), however they do not seem to acknowledge that there are exactly the same possibilities for an event that has already happened when they don't know the outcome (''epistemic uncertainty''). Under the conditions of ''epistemic uncertainty'', children simply guess one of the possibilities. Beck and colleagues (2011) propose that this happens because it is much easier to imagine the outcome during epistemic uncertainty, basically knowing that there is only one outcome.&lt;ref name="beck2011"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Beck | first1 = | last2 = McColgan | first2 = K.

J. | last2 = Pendle | first2 = J. | last3 = Rowley | first3 = M. G. | last4 = Beck | first4 = S. R. | last5 = McColgan | first5 = K. L.

=== Feeling-of-knowing (FOK) ===
Feeling-of-knowing occurs when people are unable to easily recall a memory or a fact, but they know that they learned it and are able to recognize it, such as in a multiple-choice test.&lt;ref&gt;Nelson, T.O., &amp; Narens, L. (1994). Why investigate metacognition? In J. Metcalife &amp;A.P. Shimamura (Eds.), Metacognition. Knowing about knowing (pp. 1–25). Cambridge, MA: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Adults' accuracy of feeling-of-knowing judgments is well above chance but not nearly perfect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Koriat | first1 = A | year = 1993 | title = How do we know that we know? The accessibility model of the feeling of knowing | url = | journal = Psychological Review | volume = 100 | issue = | pages = 609–639 | doi=10.1037/0033-295x.100.4.609}}&lt;/ref&gt; It seems to be the same for children as well. Lockl and Schneider (2002) did not find any developmental trends in the accuracy of feeling-of-knowing judgments. Instead, similar to adults, children's accuracy of feeling-of knowing judgments was low, but still above chance for all age groups studied (grade 1 through grade 4).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lockl | first1 = K. | last2 = Schneider | first2 = W. | year = 2002 | title = Developmental trends in children's feeling-of-knowing judgments | url = | journal = International Journal of Behavioral Development | volume = 26 | issue = | pages = 327–333 | doi=10.1080/01650250143000210}}&lt;/ref&gt; Getting a child to attend to this feeling-of-knowing (through language or prompting of prior experience) is one way to assist them in more accurately assessing their actual knowledge, allowing them to handle ambiguous situations at a much younger age.&lt;ref name="robinson1994" /&gt;

==Forensic applications==
Children are highly susceptible to a "[[suggestibility]] effect", producing "[[false memory|false memories]]" and/or "incorrect, post-event information" (see [[misinformation effect]]) when asked to engage in memory recall.&lt;ref name="welch-ross1997"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Welch-Ross | first1 = M. K. | last2 = Diecidue | first2 = K. | last3 = Miller | first3 = S. A. | year = 1997 | title = Young children's understanding of conflicting mental representation predicts suggestibility | url = | journal = Developmental Psychology | volume = 33 | issue = | pages = 43–53 | doi=10.1037/0012-1649.33.1.43}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has important implications for forensic interviewing and child witness testimony.&lt;ref name="goodman2007"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Goodman | first1 = G.S. | last2 = Melinder | first2 = A. | year = 2007 | title = Child witness research and forensic interviews of young children: A review | url = | journal = Legal and Criminological Psychology | volume = 12 | issue = | pages = 1–19 | doi=10.1348/135532506x156620}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consider the prominent case of Kelly Michael's (see [[Wee Care Nursery School abuse trial]]), where improper interviewing techniques lead to a miscarriage of justice. In order to develop reliable and age-appropriate instruments for interviewing children, it is imperative to consider their cognitive development, verbal and mental abilities.&lt;ref name="welch-ross1997" /&gt;&lt;ref name="goodman2007" /&gt;

===Forensic interviews and techniques===
====Factors that can impact disclosure====
It is critical for a forensic interviewer to recognize their power during an interview, especially with a child witness. An interviewer can impact the course of a child's testimony in numerous ways, including:
* Eliciting "false allegations" through leading and suggestive questions&lt;ref name="cronch2006" /&gt;
* Determining the amount of detail a child may disclose&lt;ref name="cronch2006" /&gt;
* Prevent a child from disclosing&lt;ref name="cronch2006" /&gt;
* Interviewer's gender may also impact the quality and details of disclosure. Children between the ages of 4 and 6 are more likely to disclose to an interviewer of the same gender.&lt;ref name="cronch2006" /&gt;

The age of a child is also an important factor during interviewing. Younger children are more likely to provide shorter, less detailed accounts of an event in comparison to older children.&lt;ref name="cronch2006" /&gt; Preschool children are more likely to disclose information in an "accidental way" through triggers and obvious cues, whereas older school children are more likely to make "intentional disclosures" based on the nature of the question they are asked.&lt;ref name="cronch2006" /&gt;

====Improper interviewing====
There are varying techniques and extraneous factors that can influence the way a child discloses an event during child witness testimony (e.g., experiences of abuse by a parent or caregiver). There are two major types of barriers in forensic interviews: (1) improper interviewing and (2) clumsy interviewing&lt;ref name="wood2000"&gt;Wood, J., &amp; Garven, S. (2000). How sexual abuse interviews go astray: Implications for prosecutors, police and child protection services. ''Child Maltreatment'', 5, 109-118.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cronch2006"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cronch | first1 = L. E. | last2 = Viljoen | first2 = J. L. | last3 = Hansen | first3 = D. J. | year = 2006 | title = Forensic interviewing in child sexual abuse cases: Current techniques and future directions | url = | journal = Aggression and Violent Behaviour | volume = 11 | issue = | pages = 195–207 | doi=10.1016/j.avb.2005.07.009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Improper interviewing'' includes forensic techniques that are considered to be "risky and ineffective".&lt;ref name="cronch2006" /&gt; Each of the following techniques can create critically negative consequences in witness testimony and result in false allegations or the potential for a reduced conviction:&lt;ref name="cronch2006" /&gt;
# Use of reinforcement: If an interviewer utilizes rewards and punishments to coerce disclosure&lt;ref name="cronch2006" /&gt;
# Social influence: If an interviewer informs a child of another child's disclosure or recollection&lt;ref name="cronch2006" /&gt;
# Asking suggestive or leading questions: This can occur when an interviewer provides a child with information that has not been previously known&lt;ref name="cronch2006" /&gt;
# Removing the child from direct experience: For example, asking a child "what ''might'' have happened"&lt;ref name="cronch2006" /&gt;

''Clumsy interviewing'' involves interviews that fail to include best practices and recommended techniques.&lt;ref name="cronch2006" /&gt; Interviewers who are not properly trained in forensic techniques can fail to follow structured interview guidelines and impact the outcome of a child's testimony and/or responses to questioning. This type of interviewing most often occurs when an interviewer lacks skill, forgets important procedures, and when there is a lack of necessary supervision.&lt;ref name="cronch2006" /&gt;

In order to prevent improper forensic interviewing, numerous methods to reduce suggestibility and the misinformation effect have been proven effective, including: taping interviews, recording transcripts, ensuring supervision by a qualified professional, experience in working with children, training in forensic interviewing, and maintaining a comfortable, safe environment.&lt;ref name="cronch2006" /&gt;

====Types of interviewing====
The '''''cognitive interview''''' utilizes cognitive theory as a focal point in its interview methodology. The cognitive interview, first developed in 1992 by researchers Fisher and Geiselman, was originally developed for adults and later modified for children. It utilizes two major perspectives from cognitive theory, including the "[[encoding specificity principle]]" and a "multi-component view of memory traces".&lt;ref name="goodman2007" /&gt;

Specifically, this method utilizes four major techniques:&lt;ref name="goodman2007" /&gt;
# Report everything: i.e., "''tell me everything you remember''"&lt;ref name="goodman2007" /&gt;
# Context reinstatement: i.e., "''think back to where you were at the time''"&lt;ref name="goodman2007" /&gt;
# Reverse order: i.e., "''now that you told me what happened, try to remember it again but this time starting at the end and recounting it in reverse chronological order''"&lt;ref name="goodman2007" /&gt;
# Change perspective: i.e., "''what would the perpetrator have seen and heard?''"&lt;ref name="goodman2007" /&gt;

'''''The National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) Protocol'''''
developed an investigative protocol in 2000 to create a structured interview technique for children, specifically those of child sexual abuse.&lt;ref name="goodman2007" /&gt;&lt;ref name="cronch2006" /&gt;&lt;ref name="lamb2007"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lamb | first1 = M. E. | last2 = Orbach | first2 = Y. | last3 = Hershkowitz | first3 = I. | last4 = Esplin | first4 = P. W. | last5 = Horowitz | first5 = D. | year = 2007 | title = A structured forensic interview protocol improves the quality and informativeness of investigative interviews with children: A review of research using the NICHD Investigative Protocol | journal = Child Abuse &amp; Neglect | volume = 31 | issue = | pages = 1201–1231 | doi=10.1016/j.chiabu.2007.03.021 | pmid=18023872 | pmc=2180422}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It uses the following techniques:&lt;ref name="goodman2007" /&gt;&lt;ref name="lamb2007" /&gt;
# Introductory phase: This is necessary for [[rapport]] building&lt;ref name="goodman2007" /&gt;
# Practice in free-recall: "''Tell me about your last birthday party''"&lt;ref name="goodman2007" /&gt;
# Information about the ground rules: "''It's okay to say "I don't know"''"&lt;ref name="goodman2007" /&gt;
# Open-ended questions: "''Tell me why you came to talk to me''"&lt;ref name="goodman2007" /&gt;

'''''Stepwise interview'''''
utilizes open-ended questions through a "funnel-like strategy".&lt;ref name="goodman2007" /&gt; It is primarily used by legal professionals, and is most often used in North America.&lt;ref name="goodman2007" /&gt; This interview begins with open-ended questions and/or free recall and slowly incorporates more focused and detailed questions.&lt;ref name="goodman2007" /&gt;

'''''Allegation blind interviews'''''
stress that an interviewer should refrain from gathering information prior to an interview in order to reduce suggestibility and increase interviewer patience and attentiveness.&lt;ref name="cronch2006" /&gt; This also enhances the interviewer's ability to be non-judgmental and objective.&lt;ref name="cronch2006" /&gt;

'''''Truth-lie discussions'''''
are most useful prior to commencing abuse-related questioning. This method allows the interviewer to create a baseline with the child about what the "truth" is and what a "lie" is.&lt;ref name="cronch2006" /&gt; The interviewer is encouraged to ask questions with general examples, such as "tell me a lie about this chair".&lt;ref name="cronch2006" /&gt; This strategy has been proven to result in a less misinformed child testimony.&lt;ref name="cronch2006" /&gt;

'''''Touch survey'''''
was developed on the basis that "touch falls on a continuum", and is beneficial to screen for child abuse.&lt;ref name="cronch2006" /&gt; It includes questions surrounding the child's experiences with touch (e.g., kissing, hugging, hitting), including where they have been touched and by whom.&lt;ref name="cronch2006" /&gt; This tool might be more useful when used in conjunction with other forensic strategies.&lt;ref name="cronch2006" /&gt;

===Recommendations for forensic interviewing===
Although there are varying suggestions for structured forensic interviewing, experts provide context into best practices that can significantly reduce suggestibility, false memories and the misinformation effect:&lt;ref name="cronch2006" /&gt;
# Interviews should be conducted in a safe, child-friendly environment.&lt;ref name="cronch2006" /&gt;
# A child's age should be considered when being interviewed, and practices should be modified accordingly.&lt;ref name="cronch2006" /&gt;
# Structured interview protocol should always be utilized.&lt;ref name="cronch2006" /&gt;
# Interviewers should engage in professional training when possible.&lt;ref name="cronch2006" /&gt;
# Ground rules are essential for the beginning of the interview so that the child is aware of the type of responses they can provide (e.g., "I don't know").&lt;ref name="cronch2006" /&gt;

The '''Civil Rights Commission''' ({{lang-es|Comisión de Derechos Civiles}}) is an official entity within the [[legislative branch of the government of Puerto Rico]] charged with investigating violations of citizens' [[civil rights]]. The commission is empowered to educate citizens about their civil rights, investigate alleged civil rights violations, and carry out studies and investigations. Amendments to its organic law also empowers it to appear as a "[[amicus curiae|friend of the court]]" in cases that the commission deems to have an important effect on civil rights in Puerto Rico.

==Overview==
{{update|section|date=December 2015}}
The commission was created in 1965 under governor [[Roberto Sánchez Vilella]] as an independent agency under the [[Department of Justice (Puerto Rico)|Department of Justice]]. But it was not until 1996 that the commission was made part of the legislative branch, due, in part, to the efforts of governor [[Pedro Rosselló]].

Structurally, the entity is composed of five members that are appointed to a six-years term by the [[governor of Puerto Rico]], subject to the [[advice and consent]] of the [[Senate of Puerto Rico|Senate]]. Its current members include its chair, Georgina Candal Segurola, Esther Vicente Rivera, Rosemary Borges Capó, Ruth Miriam Perez Maldonado and [[Hiram Meléndez Juarbe|Hiram A. Meléndez Juarbe]].&lt;ref name="fortaleza1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fortaleza.pr.gov/content/gobernador-hace-nombramientos-la-comisi-n-de-derechos-civiles |title=Gobernador hace nombramientos a la Comisión de Derechos Civiles &amp;#124; La Fortaleza |language=es |website=Fortaleza.pr.gov |date=2014-06-26 |accessdate=2015-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fortaleza1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.uprrp.edu/?p=5027 |title=Nombran catedrático de la Escuela de Derecho UPR a la Comisión de Derechos Civiles |website=Uprrp.edu |date=2015-08-18 |accessdate=2015-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other individuals that have served in the commission include former Sen. [[Luis Muñoz Rivera (senator)|Luis Muñoz Rivera]], newspaper publisher [[Antonio Luis Ferré]], former [[Resident Commissioner of Puerto Rico|Resident Commissioner]] [[Baltasar Corrada del Río]], and the late Efraín González Tejera.

In spite of complaints that the commission is chronically underfunded, the entity has had a significant influence in Puerto Rican government operations.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

The commission also annually selects the recipients of the [[Thurgood Marshall]] Award, which recognizes the commitment to civil rights of one law student from each of Puerto Rico's three law schools.

{{Classical mechanics}}
[[File:Orbital motion.gif|thumb|right|180px|alt=animation of orbital velocity and centripetal acceleration|Diagram of orbital motion of a satellite around the earth, showing perpendicular velocity and acceleration (force) vectors.]]
'''Classical mechanics''' describes the motion of [[macroscopic]] objects, from [[Projectile|projectiles]] to parts of [[Machine (mechanical)|machinery]], and [[astronomical objects]],  such as [[spacecraft]], [[planets]], [[Star|stars]] and [[galaxies]]. 

If the present state of an object is known it is possible to predict by the [[Physical law|laws]] of classical mechanics how it will move in the future (determinism) and how it has moved in the past (reversibility).

The earliest development of classical mechanics is often referred to as Newtonian mechanics. It consists of the physical concepts employed by and the mathematical methods invented by [[Isaac Newton]] and [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]] and others in the 17th century to describe the motion of [[Physical body|bodies]] under the influence of a system of [[Force|forces]].

Later, more abstract methods were developed, leading to the reformulations of classical mechanics known as [[Lagrangian mechanics]] and [[Hamiltonian mechanics]]. These advances, made predominantly in the 18th and 19th centuries, extend substantially beyond Newton's work, particularly through their use of [[analytical mechanics]]. They are, with some modification, also used in all areas of modern physics.

Classical mechanics provides extremely accurate results when studying large objects that are not extremely massive and speeds not approaching the [[speed of light]]. When the objects being examined have about the size of an atom diameter, it becomes necessary to introduce the other major sub-field of [[mechanics]]: [[quantum mechanics]]. To describe velocities that are not small compared to the speed of light, [[special relativity]] is needed. In case that objects become extremely massive,  [[general relativity]] becomes applicable. However, a number of modern sources do include relativistic mechanics into classical physics, which in their view represents classical mechanics in its most developed and accurate form.&lt;ref group=note&gt;The notion of "classical" may be somewhat confusing, since this term usually refers to the era of [[classical antiquity]] in [[European history]]. While many discoveries within the [[mathematics]] of that period are applicable today and of great use, much of the science that emerged from that time has since been superseded by more accurate models. This in no way detracts from the science of that time as most of modern physics is built directly upon those developments. The emergence of classical mechanics was a decisive stage in the development of [[science]], in the modern sense of the term. Above all, it is characterized by an insistence that more rigor be used to describe the behavior of bodies. Such an exacting foundation is only available through [[mathematical]] treatment and reliance on [[experiment]], rather than [[speculative reason|speculation]]. Classical mechanics established a way to predict the behavior of objects in a quantitative manner and ways to test these predictions through carefully designed [[measurement]]. The emerging globally cooperative endeavor provided increased scrutiny and testing of both theory and experiment. This remains a key factor in establishing certainty in knowledge and in bringing it to the service of society. History shows how closely the health and wealth of a society depend on nurturing this investigative and critical approach.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!--This view seems very useful as an aside note, as in "for further information". --&gt;

==Description of the theory==
[[File:Tir parabòlic.svg|thumb|alt=diagram of parabolic projectile motion|The analysis of projectile motion is a part of classical mechanics.]]
The following introduces the basic concepts of classical mechanics. For simplicity, it often models real-world objects as [[point particle]]s (objects with negligible size). The motion of a point particle is characterized by a small number of [[parameter]]s: its position, [[mass]], and the [[force]]s applied to it. Each of these parameters is discussed in turn.

In reality, the kind of objects that classical mechanics can describe always have a [[0 (number)|non-zero]] size. (The physics of ''very'' small particles, such as the [[electron]], is more accurately described by [[quantum mechanics]].) Objects with non-zero size have more complicated behavior than hypothetical point particles, because of the additional [[degrees of freedom (physics and chemistry)|degrees of freedom]], e.g., a [[baseball]] can [[rotation|spin]] while it is moving. However, the results for point particles can be used to study such objects by treating them as [[wikt:composite|composite]] objects, made of a large number of collectively acting point particles. The [[center of mass]] of a composite object behaves like a point particle.

Classical mechanics uses [[common-sense]] notions of how matter and forces exist and interact. It assumes that matter and energy have definite, knowable attributes such as location in space and speed. Non-relativistic mechanics also assumes that forces act instantaneously (see also [[Action at a distance]]).

The ''position'' of a [[point particle]] is defined in relation to a [[coordinate system]] centered on an arbitrary fixed reference point in [[space]] called the origin ''O''. A simple coordinate system might describe the position of a [[particle]] ''P'' with a [[Vector (geometric)|vector]] notated by an arrow labeled '''r''' that points from the origin ''O'' to point ''P''. In general, the point particle does not need to be stationary relative to ''O''.  In cases where ''P'' is moving relative to ''O'', '''r''' is defined as a function of ''t'', [[time]]. In pre-Einstein relativity (known as [[Galilean relativity]]), time is considered an absolute, i.e., the [[time interval]] that is observed to elapse between any given pair of events is the same for all observers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Elements of Newtonian Mechanics |edition=illustrated |first1=Jens M. |last1=Knudsen |first2=Poul |last2=Hjorth |publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media |year=2012 |isbn=978-3-642-97599-8 |page=30 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rkP1CAAAQBAJ}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=rkP1CAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA30 Extract of page 30]&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to relying on [[absolute time]], classical mechanics assumes [[Euclidean geometry]] for the structure of space.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/physics/8-01-physics-i-fall-2003/lecture-notes/binder1.pdf MIT physics 8.01 lecture notes (page 12)] {{webarchive|url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20130709154423/http%3A//ocw.mit.edu/courses/physics/8%2D01%2Dphysics%2Di%2Dfall%2D2003/lecture%2Dnotes/binder1.pdf |date=2013-07-09 }} (PDF)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Velocity and speed====
{{Main|Velocity|speed}}
The ''[[velocity]]'', or the [[calculus|rate of change]] of position with time, is defined as the [[derivative]] of the position with respect to time:
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v} = {\mathrm{d}\mathbf{r} \over \mathrm{d}t}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;.

In classical mechanics, velocities are directly additive and subtractive. For example, if one car travels east at 60&amp;nbsp;km/h and passes another car traveling in the same direction at 50&amp;nbsp;km/h, the slower car perceives the faster car as traveling east at {{nowrap|60 − 50 {{=}} 10 km/h}}. However, from the perspective of the faster car, the slower car is moving 10&amp;nbsp;km/h to the west, often denoted as -10&amp;nbsp;km/h where the sign implies opposite direction. Velocities are directly additive as [[Wikibooks:Physics with Calculus/Mechanics/Scalar and Vector Quantities|vector quantities]]; they must be dealt with using [[vector analysis]].

Mathematically, if the velocity of the first object in the previous discussion is denoted by the vector {{nowrap|'''u''' {{=}} ''u'''''d'''}} and the velocity of the second object by the vector {{nowrap|'''v''' {{=}} ''v'''''e'''}}, where ''u'' is the speed of the first object, ''v'' is the speed of the second object, and '''d''' and '''e''' are [[unit vector]]s in the directions of motion of each object respectively, then the velocity of the first object as seen by the second object is
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{u}' = \mathbf{u} - \mathbf{v} \, .&lt;/math&gt;

Similarly, the first object sees the velocity of the second object as
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v'}= \mathbf{v} - \mathbf{u} \, .&lt;/math&gt;

When both objects are moving in the same direction, this equation can be simplified to
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{u}' = ( u - v ) \mathbf{d} \, .&lt;/math&gt;

Or, by ignoring direction, the difference can be given in terms of speed only:
:&lt;math&gt;u' = u - v \, .&lt;/math&gt;

====Acceleration====
{{Main|Acceleration}}
The ''[[acceleration]]'', or rate of change of velocity, is the [[derivative]] of the velocity with respect to time (the [[derivative|second derivative]] of the position with respect to time):
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a} = {\mathrm{d}\mathbf{v} \over \mathrm{d}t} = {\mathrm{d^2}\mathbf{r} \over \mathrm{d}t^2}.&lt;/math&gt;

Acceleration represents the velocity's change over time.  Velocity can change in either magnitude or direction, or both. Occasionally, a decrease in the magnitude of velocity "''v''" is referred to as ''deceleration'', but generally any change in the velocity over time, including deceleration, is simply referred to as acceleration.

====Frames of reference====
{{Main|Inertial frame of reference|Galilean transformation}}
While the position, velocity and acceleration of a [[particle]] can be described with respect to any [[observer (special relativity)|observer]] in any state of motion, classical mechanics assumes the existence of a special family of [[frame of reference|reference frames]] in which the mechanical laws of nature take a comparatively simple form. These special reference frames are called [[inertial frames]]. 

An inertial frame is a frame of reference within which an object interacting with no forces (an idealized situation) appears either at rest or moving uniformly in a straight line. This is the fundamental definition of an inertial frame. These are characterized by the requirement that all forces entering the observer's [[physical law]]s{{clarify|date=October 2013}} originate from identifiable sources caused by [[field (physics)|fields]], such as electro-static field (caused by static electrical charges), electro-magnetic field (caused by moving charges), gravitational field (caused by mass), and so forth.

A key concept of inertial frames is the method for identifying them. For practical purposes, reference frames that do not accelerate with respect to [[star|distant stars]] (an extremely distant point) are regarded as good approximations to inertial frames. [[Non-inertial reference frame]]s accelerate in relation to an existing inertial frame. They form the basis for Einstein's relativity.  Due to the relative motion, particles in the non-inertial frame appear to move in ways not explained by forces from existing fields in the reference frame. Hence, it appears that there are other forces that enter the equations of motion solely as a result of the relative acceleration. These forces are referred to as [[fictitious force]]s, inertia forces, or pseudo-forces.  

Consider two [[reference frames]] ''S'' and &lt;var&gt;S'&lt;/var&gt;. For observers in each of the reference frames an event has space-time coordinates of (''x'',''y'',''z'',''t'') in frame ''S'' and (&lt;var&gt;x'&lt;/var&gt;,&lt;var&gt;y'&lt;/var&gt;,&lt;var&gt;z'&lt;/var&gt;,&lt;var&gt;t'&lt;/var&gt;) in frame &lt;var&gt;S'&lt;/var&gt;. Assuming time is measured the same in all reference frames, and if we require {{nowrap|''x'' {{=}} &lt;var&gt;x'&lt;/var&gt;}} when {{nowrap|''t'' {{=}} 0}}, then the relation between the space-time coordinates of the same event observed from the reference frames &lt;var&gt;S'&lt;/var&gt; and ''S'', which are moving at a relative velocity of ''u'' in the ''x'' direction is:
:&lt;math&gt;x' = x - u t \,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;y' = y \,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;z' = z \,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;t' = t \, .&lt;/math&gt;

This set of formulas defines a [[group transformation]] known as the [[Galilean transformation]] (informally, the ''Galilean transform''). This group is a limiting case of the [[Poincaré group]] used in [[special relativity]]. The limiting case applies when the velocity ''u'' is very small compared to ''c'', the [[speed of light]].

The transformations have the following consequences:
*'''v'''′ = '''v''' − '''u''' (the velocity '''v'''′ of a particle from the perspective of ''S''′ is slower by '''u''' than its velocity '''v''' from the perspective of ''S'')
*'''a'''′ = '''a''' (the acceleration of a particle is the same in any inertial reference frame)
*'''F'''′ = '''F''' (the force on a particle is the same in any inertial reference frame)
*the  [[speed of light]] is not a constant in classical mechanics, nor does the special position given to the speed of light in [[relativistic mechanics]] have a counterpart in classical mechanics.

For some problems, it is convenient to use rotating coordinates (reference frames). Thereby one can either keep a mapping to a convenient inertial frame, or introduce additionally a fictitious [[centrifugal force (fictitious)|centrifugal force]] and [[Coriolis force]].

===Forces; Newton's second law===
{{Main|Force|Newton's laws of motion}}
[[Isaac Newton|Newton]] was the first to mathematically express the relationship between [[force]] and [[momentum]]. Some physicists interpret [[Newton's laws of motion#Newton's second law|Newton's second law of motion]] as a definition of force and mass, while others consider it a fundamental postulate, a law of nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Thornton|first1=Stephen T.|last2=Marion|first2=Jerry B.|title=Classical dynamics of particles and systems|date=2004|publisher=Brooks/Cole|location=Belmont, Calif. [u.a.]|isbn=978-0-534-40896-1|pages=50|edition=5.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Either interpretation has the same mathematical consequences, historically known as "Newton's Second Law":
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F} = {\mathrm{d}\mathbf{p} \over \mathrm{d}t} = {\mathrm{d}(m \mathbf{v}) \over \mathrm{d}t}.&lt;/math&gt;

The quantity ''m'''''v''' is called the ([[canonical momentum|canonical]]) [[momentum]]. The net force on a particle is thus equal to the rate of change of the momentum of the particle with time. Since the definition of acceleration is {{nowrap|'''a''' {{=}} d'''v'''/d''t''}}, the second law can be written in the simplified and more familiar form:
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F} = m \mathbf{a} \, .&lt;/math&gt;

So long as the force acting on a particle is known, Newton's second law is sufficient to describe the motion of a particle. Once independent relations for each force acting on a particle are available, they can be substituted into Newton's second law to obtain an [[ordinary differential equation]], which is called the ''equation of motion''.

As an example, assume that friction is the only force acting on the particle, and that it may be modeled as a function of the velocity of the particle, for example:
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F}_{\rm R} = - \lambda \mathbf{v} \, ,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''λ'' is a positive constant, the negative sign states that the force is opposite the sense of the velocity. Then the equation of motion is
:&lt;math&gt;- \lambda \mathbf{v} = m \mathbf{a} = m {\mathrm{d}\mathbf{v} \over \mathrm{d}t} \, .&lt;/math&gt;

This can be [[antiderivative|integrated]] to obtain
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v} = \mathbf{v}_0 e^\frac{-\lambda t}{m}&lt;/math&gt;

where '''v'''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the initial velocity. This means that the velocity of this particle [[exponential decay|decays exponentially]] to zero as time progresses. In this case, an equivalent viewpoint is that the kinetic energy of the particle is absorbed by friction (which converts it to heat energy in accordance with the [[conservation of energy]]), and the particle is slowing down. This expression can be further integrated to obtain the position '''r''' of the particle as a function of time.

Important forces include the [[gravity|gravitational force]] and the [[Lorentz force]] for [[electromagnetism]]. In addition, [[Newton's third law]] can sometimes be used to deduce the forces acting on a particle: if it is known that particle ''A'' exerts a force '''F''' on another particle ''B'', it follows that ''B'' must exert an equal and opposite ''reaction force'', −'''F''', on ''A''. The strong form of Newton's third law requires that '''F''' and −'''F''' act along the line connecting ''A'' and ''B'', while the weak form does not. Illustrations of the weak form of Newton's third law are often found for magnetic forces.{{clarify|date=January 2016}}

===Work and energy===
{{Main|Work (physics)|kinetic energy|potential energy}}
If a constant force '''F''' is applied to a particle that makes a displacement Δ'''r''',&lt;ref group="note"&gt;The displacement Δ'''r''' is the difference of the particle's initial and final positions: Δ'''r''' = '''r'''&lt;sub&gt;final&lt;/sub&gt; − '''r'''&lt;sub&gt;initial&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; the ''work done'' by the force is defined as the [[scalar product]] of the force and displacement vectors:
:&lt;math&gt;W = \mathbf{F} \cdot \Delta \mathbf{r} \, .&lt;/math&gt;

More generally, if the force varies as a function of position as the particle moves from '''r'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; to '''r'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; along a path ''C'', the work done on the particle is given by the [[line integral]]
:&lt;math&gt;W = \int_C \mathbf{F}(\mathbf{r}) \cdot \mathrm{d}\mathbf{r} \, .&lt;/math&gt;

If the work done in moving the particle from '''r'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; to '''r'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is the same no matter what path is taken, the force is said to be [[Conservative force|conservative]]. [[Gravity]] is a conservative force, as is the force due to an idealized [[Spring (device)|spring]], as given by [[Hooke's law]]. The force due to [[friction]] is non-conservative.

The [[kinetic energy]] ''E''&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt; of a particle of mass ''m'' travelling at speed ''v'' is given by
:&lt;math&gt;E_\mathrm{k} = \tfrac{1}{2}mv^2 \, .&lt;/math&gt;

For extended objects composed of many particles, the kinetic energy of the composite body is the sum of the kinetic energies of the particles.

The [[work–energy theorem]] states that for a particle of constant mass ''m'', the total work ''W'' done on the particle as it moves from position '''r'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; to '''r'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is equal to the change in [[kinetic energy]] ''E''&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt; of the particle:
:&lt;math&gt;W = \Delta E_\mathrm{k} = E_\mathrm{k,2} - E_\mathrm{k,1} = \tfrac{1}{2}m\left(v_2^{\, 2} - v_1^{\, 2}\right) \, .&lt;/math&gt;

Conservative forces can be expressed as the [[gradient]] of a scalar function, known as the [[potential energy]] and denoted ''E''&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F} = - \mathbf{\nabla} E_\mathrm{p} \, .&lt;/math&gt;

If all the forces acting on a particle are conservative, and ''E''&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; is the total potential energy (which is defined as a work of involved forces to rearrange mutual positions of bodies), obtained by summing the potential energies corresponding to each force
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F} \cdot \Delta \mathbf{r} = - \mathbf{\nabla} E_\mathrm{p} \cdot \Delta \mathbf{r} = - \Delta E_\mathrm{p} \, .&lt;/math&gt;
 
The decrease in the potential energy is equal to the increase in the kinetic energy
:&lt;math&gt;-\Delta E_\mathrm{p} = \Delta E_\mathrm{k} \Rightarrow \Delta (E_\mathrm{k} + E_\mathrm{p}) = 0 \, .&lt;/math&gt;

This result is known as ''conservation of energy'' and states that the total [[energy]],
:&lt;math&gt;\sum E = E_\mathrm{k} + E_\mathrm{p} \, ,&lt;/math&gt;

is constant in time. It is often useful, because many commonly encountered forces are conservative.

===Beyond Newton's laws===
Classical mechanics also describes the more complex motions of extended non-pointlike objects. [[Euler's laws]] provide extensions to Newton's laws in this area. The concepts of [[angular momentum]] rely on the same [[calculus]] used to describe one-dimensional motion. The [[rocket equation]] extends the notion of rate of change of an object's momentum to include the effects of an object "losing mass".

There are two important alternative formulations of classical mechanics: [[Lagrangian mechanics]] and [[Hamiltonian mechanics]]. These, and other modern formulations, usually bypass the concept of "force", instead referring to other physical quantities, such as energy, speed and momentum, for describing mechanical systems in [[generalized coordinates]].

The expressions given above for momentum and kinetic energy are only valid when there is no significant electromagnetic contribution. In electromagnetism, Newton's second law for current-carrying wires breaks down unless one includes the electromagnetic field contribution to the momentum of the system as expressed by the [[Poynting vector]] divided by ''c''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, where ''c'' is the [[speed of light]] in free space.

==Limits of validity==
[[File:physicsdomains.svg|380px|thumb|alt=two by two chart of mechanics for size by speed|Domain of validity for Classical Mechanics]]
Many branches of classical mechanics are simplifications or approximations of more accurate forms; two of the most accurate being [[general relativity]] and relativistic [[statistical mechanics]]. [[Geometric optics]] is an approximation to the [[Quantum optics|quantum theory of light]], and does not have a superior "classical" form.

When both quantum mechanics and classical mechanics cannot apply, such as at the quantum level with many degrees of freedom, [[quantum field theory]] (QFT) is of use. QFT deals with small distances and large speeds with many degrees of freedom as well as the possibility of any change in the number of particles throughout the interaction. When treating large degrees of freedom at the macroscopic level, [[statistical mechanics]] becomes useful. Statistical mechanics describes the behavior of large (but countable) numbers of particles and their interactions as a whole at the macroscopic level. Statistical mechanics is mainly used in [[thermodynamics]] for systems that lie outside the bounds of the assumptions of classical thermodynamics. In the case of high [[velocity]] objects approaching the speed of light, classical mechanics is enhanced by [[special relativity]]. In case that objects become extremely heavy (i.e. their [[Schwarzschild radius]] is not negligibly small for a given application), deviations from Newtonian mechanics become apparent and can be quantified by using the [[Parameterized post-Newtonian formalism]]. In that case, [[General relativity]] (GR) becomes applicable. However, until now there is no theory of [[General relativity|Quantum gravity]] unifying GR and QFT in the sense that it could be used when objects become extremely small and heavy.[[Classical mechanics#cite note-Hamber 2009-4|[4]]][[Classical mechanics#cite note-5|[5]]]

===The Newtonian approximation to special relativity===
In special relativity, the momentum of a particle is given by
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{p} = \frac{m \mathbf{v}}{ \sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \, ,&lt;/math&gt;
where ''m'' is the particle's rest mass, '''v''' its velocity, ''v'' is the modulus of '''v''', and ''c'' is the speed of light.

If ''v'' is very small compared to ''c'', ''v''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/''c''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is approximately zero, and so
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{p} \approx m\mathbf{v} \, .&lt;/math&gt;
Thus the Newtonian equation {{nowrap|'''p''' {{=}} ''m'''''v'''}} is an approximation of the relativistic equation for bodies moving with low speeds compared to the speed of light.

For example, the relativistic cyclotron frequency of a [[cyclotron]], [[gyrotron]], or high voltage [[magnetron]] is given by
:&lt;math&gt;f = f_\mathrm{c}\frac{m_0}{m_0 + T/c^2} \, ,&lt;/math&gt;
where ''f''&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; is the classical frequency of an electron (or other charged particle) with kinetic energy ''T'' and ([[Invariant mass|rest]]) mass ''m''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; circling in a magnetic field. The (rest) mass of an electron is 511&amp;nbsp;keV. So the frequency correction is 1% for a magnetic vacuum tube with a 5.11&amp;nbsp;kV direct current accelerating voltage.

===The classical approximation to quantum mechanics===
The ray approximation of classical mechanics breaks down when the [[de Broglie wavelength]] is not much smaller than other dimensions of the system. For non-relativistic particles, this wavelength is
:&lt;math&gt;\lambda=\frac{h}{p}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''h'' is [[Planck's constant]] and ''p'' is the momentum.

Again, this happens with [[electrons]] before it happens with heavier particles. For example, the electrons used by [[Clinton Davisson]] and [[Lester Germer]] in 1927, accelerated by 54&amp;nbsp;V, had a wavelength of 0.167&amp;nbsp;nm, which was long enough to exhibit a single [[diffraction]] [[side lobe]] when reflecting from the face of a nickel [[crystal]] with atomic spacing of 0.215&amp;nbsp;nm. With a larger [[vacuum chamber]], it would seem relatively easy to increase the [[angular resolution]] from around a radian to a [[milliradian]] and see quantum diffraction from the periodic patterns of [[integrated circuit]] computer memory.

More practical examples of the failure of classical mechanics on an engineering scale are conduction by [[quantum tunneling]] in [[tunnel diode]]s and very narrow [[transistor]] [[gate (transistor)|gates]] in [[integrated circuit]]s.

Classical mechanics is the same extreme [[high frequency approximation]] as [[geometric optics]]. It is more often accurate because it describes particles and bodies with [[rest mass]]. These have more momentum and therefore shorter De Broglie wavelengths than massless particles, such as light, with the same kinetic energies.

==History==
{{Main|History of classical mechanics}}
{{See also|Timeline of classical mechanics}}
The study of the motion of bodies is an ancient one, making classical mechanics one of the oldest and largest subjects in [[science]], [[engineering]] and [[technology]],

Some [[Greek philosophers]] of antiquity, among them [[Aristotle]], founder of [[Aristotelian physics]], may have been the first to maintain the idea that "everything happens for a reason" and that theoretical principles can assist in the understanding of nature. While to a modern reader, many of these preserved ideas come forth as eminently reasonable, there is a conspicuous lack of both mathematical [[theory]] and controlled [[experiment]], as we know it. These later became decisive factors in forming modern science, and their early application came to be known as classical mechanics.

In his ''Elementa super demonstrationem ponderum'', medieval mathematician [[Jordanus de Nemore]] introduced the concept of "positional [[gravity]]" and the use of component [[forces]].&lt;!--looks like Jagged misuse of sources: An early mathematical and experimental [[scientific method]] was introduced into [[Islamic science#Mechanics|mechanics]] in the 11th century by [[al-Biruni]], who along with [[al-Khazini]] in the 12th century, unified [[statics]] and [[Analytical dynamics|dynamics]] into the [[science]] of mechanics, and combined the fields of [[hydrostatics]] with dynamics to create the field of [[hydrodynamics]].&lt;ref&gt;Mariam Rozhanskaya and I.

The first published [[causal]] explanation of the motions of [[planets]] was Johannes Kepler's ''[[Astronomia nova]],'' published in 1609. He concluded, based on [[Tycho Brahe]]'s observations on the orbit of [[Mars]], that the planet's orbits were [[ellipse]]s. This break with [[Ancient philosophy|ancient thought]] was happening around the same time that [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]] was proposing abstract mathematical laws for the motion of objects. He may (or may not) have performed the famous experiment of dropping two cannonballs of different weights from the [[Leaning Tower of Pisa|tower of Pisa]], showing that they both hit the ground at the same time. The reality of that particular experiment is disputed, but he did carry out quantitative experiments by rolling balls on an [[inclined plane]]. His theory of accelerated motion was derived from the results of such experiments and forms a cornerstone of classical mechanics.

Newton founded his principles of natural philosophy on three proposed [[Newton's laws of motion|laws of motion]]: the [[law of inertia]], his second law of acceleration (mentioned above), and the law of [[action and reaction]]; and hence laid the foundations for classical mechanics. Both Newton's second and third laws were given the proper scientific and mathematical treatment in Newton's ''[[Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica]].'' Here they are distinguished from earlier attempts at explaining similar phenomena, which were either incomplete, incorrect, or given little accurate mathematical expression. Newton also enunciated the principles of [[conservation of momentum]] and [[angular momentum]]. In mechanics, Newton was also the first to provide the first correct&lt;!--is this redundant?--&gt; scientific and mathematical formulation of [[gravity]] in [[Newton's law of universal gravitation]]. The combination of Newton's laws of motion and gravitation provide the fullest and most accurate description of classical mechanics. He demonstrated that these laws apply to everyday objects as well as to celestial objects. In particular, he obtained a theoretical explanation of [[Kepler's laws]] of motion of the planets.

Newton had previously invented the [[calculus]], of mathematics, and used it to perform the mathematical calculations. For acceptability, his book, the [[Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica|''Principia'']], was formulated entirely in terms of the long-established geometric methods, which were soon eclipsed by his calculus. However, it was [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]] who developed the notation of the [[derivative]] and [[integral]] preferred&lt;ref&gt;Jesseph, Douglas M. (1998).

[[File:WilliamRowanHamilton.jpeg|left|thumb|180px|alt=photograph of William Rowan Hamilton in looking left|[[William Rowan Hamilton|Hamilton]]'s greatest contribution is perhaps the reformulation of [[Newtonian mechanics]], now called [[Hamiltonian mechanics]].]]
Newton, and most of his contemporaries, with the notable exception of [[Christiaan Huygens|Huygens]], worked on the assumption that classical mechanics would be able to explain all phenomena, including [[light]], in the form of [[geometric optics]]. Even when discovering the so-called [[Newton's rings]] (a [[wave interference]] phenomenon) he maintained his own [[corpuscular theory of light]].

After Newton, classical mechanics became a principal field of study in mathematics as well as physics. Several re-formulations progressively allowed finding solutions to a far greater number of problems. The first notable re-formulation was in 1788 by [[Joseph Louis Lagrange]]. Lagrangian mechanics was in turn re-formulated in 1833 by [[William Rowan Hamilton]].

Some difficulties were discovered in the late 19th century that could only be resolved by more modern physics. Some of these difficulties related to compatibility with [[electromagnetic theory]], and the famous [[Michelson–Morley experiment]]. The resolution of these problems led to the [[special theory of relativity]], often still considered a part of classical mechanics.

A second set of difficulties were related to thermodynamics. When combined with [[thermodynamics]], classical mechanics leads to the [[Gibbs paradox]] of classical [[statistical mechanics]], in which [[entropy]] is not a well-defined quantity. [[Planck's law|Black-body radiation]] was not explained without the introduction of [[quantum|quanta]]. As experiments reached the atomic level, classical mechanics failed to explain, even approximately, such basic things as the [[energy levels]] and sizes of [[atoms]] and the [[photo-electric effect]]. The effort at resolving these problems led to the development of [[quantum mechanics]].

Since the end of the 20th century, classical mechanics in [[physics]] has no longer been an independent theory. Instead, classical mechanics is now considered an approximate theory to the more general quantum mechanics. Emphasis has shifted to understanding the fundamental forces of nature as in the [[Standard model]] and its more modern extensions into a unified [[theory of everything]].&lt;ref&gt;Page 2-10 of the ''[[Feynman Lectures on Physics]]'' says "For already in classical mechanics there was indeterminability from a practical point of view." The past tense here implies that classical physics is no longer fundamental.&lt;/ref&gt; Classical mechanics is a theory useful for the study of the motion of non-quantum mechanical, low-energy particles in weak gravitational fields. Also, it has been extended into the [[complex domain]] where complex classical mechanics exhibits behaviors very similar to quantum mechanics.&lt;ref&gt;[https://arxiv.org/abs/1001.0131 Complex Elliptic Pendulum], Carl M. Bender, Daniel W. Hook, Karta Kooner in [https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-88-7642-379-6_1 Asymptotics in Dynamics, Geometry and PDEs; Generalized Borel Summation vol. I]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--Messy paragraph.--&gt;

==Branches==
Classical mechanics was traditionally divided into three main branches:
*[[Statics]], the study of [[Mechanical equilibrium|equilibrium]] and its relation to [[force]]s
*[[Analytical dynamics|Dynamics]], the study of motion and its relation to forces
*[[Kinematics]], dealing with the implications of observed motions without regard for circumstances causing them

Another division is based on the choice of mathematical formalism:
*[[Newton's laws of motion|Newtonian mechanics]]
*[[Lagrangian mechanics]]
*[[Hamiltonian mechanics]]

Alternatively, a division can be made by region of application:
*[[Celestial mechanics]], relating to [[star]]s, [[planet]]s and other celestial bodies
*[[Continuum mechanics]], for materials modelled as a continuum, e.g., [[solid]]s and [[fluid]]s (i.e., [[liquid]]s and [[gas]]es).
*[[Relativistic mechanics]] (i.e. including the [[Special relativity|special]] and [[general relativity|general]] theories of relativity), for bodies whose speed is close to the speed of light.
*[[Statistical mechanics]], which provides a framework for relating the microscopic properties of individual atoms and molecules to the macroscopic or bulk [[thermodynamics|thermodynamic]] properties of materials.

The '''Classification of Instructional Programs''' ('''CIP''') is a [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]] of [[List of academic disciplines|academic disciplines]] at institutions of [[higher education]] in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]].

The CIP was originally developed by the [[National Center for Education Statistics]] (NCES) of the [[United States Department of Education]] in 1980 and was revised in 1985, 1990, 2000 and 2010. The 2010 edition (CIP 2010) is the fourth and current revision of the taxonomy. Instructional programs are classified by a six-digit CIP at the most granular level and are classified according to the two-digit and four-digit prefixes of the code. For example, "Forensic Science and Technology" has the six-digit code 43.0106, which places it in "Criminal Justice and Corrections" (43.01) and "Homeland Security, Law Enforcement, Firefighting and Related Protective Services" (two-digit CIP 43).

'''Coon songs''' were a [[Music genre|genre of music]] that presented a [[African-American stereotypes|stereotyped image of black people]]. They were popular in the [[United States]] and the [[United Kingdom]] from around 1880&lt;ref name="d452"/&gt; to 1920,&lt;ref&gt;Reublin, ''Parlor Songs'', April 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; though the earliest such songs date from [[minstrel shows]] as far back as 1848.&lt;ref&gt;Hubbard-Brown, Janet; ''Scott Joplin: Composer'';  Chelsea House; New York:  2006.  p.22.  {{ISBN|0-791-092-119}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rise and fall from popularity==
The first explicitly coon-themed song, published in 1880, may have been "The Dandy Coon's Parade" by [[J.P. Skelley]].&lt;ref name="d452"&gt;Dormon, 452.&lt;/ref&gt;  Other notable early coon songs included "The Coons Are on Parade", "New Coon in Town" (by [[J.S. Putnam]], 1883), "Coon Salvation Army" (by [[Sam Lucas]], 1884), "Coon [[Schottische]]" (by William Dressler, 1884).&lt;ref name="d452"/&gt;

By the mid-1880s, coon songs were a national [[Fad|craze]]; over 600 such songs were published in the 1890s.&lt;ref name="d453"&gt;Dormon, 453.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="l106"&gt;Lemons, 106.&lt;/ref&gt;  The most successful songs sold millions of copies.&lt;ref name="d453"/&gt;  To take advantage of the fad, composers "add[ed] words typical of coon songs to previously published songs and rags".&lt;ref name="reublin"&gt;Reublin &amp; Maine.&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Every race has a flag but the coon.jpg|Sheet music to "Every Race Has a Flag But the Coon"|thumb|180px]]
After the turn of the century, coon songs began to receive criticism for their racist content.&lt;ref name="a35"&gt;Abbott, 35.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1905, [[Bob Cole (composer)|Bob Cole]], an African-American composer who had gained fame largely by writing coon songs, made somewhat unprecedented remarks about the genre.&lt;ref name="a35"/&gt; When asked in an interview about the name of his earlier comedy ''[[A Trip to Coontown]]'', he replied, "That day has passed with the softly flowing tide of revelations."&lt;ref name="a35"/&gt; Following further criticism the use of "coon" in song titles greatly decreased after 1910.&lt;ref name="a35"/&gt;

On August 13, 1920, the [[Universal Negro Improvement Association and African Communities League]] created the [[Pan-African flag|Red, Black and Green flag]] as a response to the song "[[Every Race Has a Flag but the Coon]]" by [[Will A. Heelan|Heelan]] and [[J. Fred Helf|Helf]]. That song along with "[[Coon, Coon, Coon]]" and "[[All Coons Look Alike to Me]]" were identified by [[H.L. Mencken]] as being the songs which firmly established the derogatory term "coon" in the American vocabulary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mencken|first1=H. L.|title=Designations for Colored Folk (1944)|url=http://www.virginia.edu/woodson/courses/aas102%20(spring%2001)/articles/names/mencken.htm|website=www.virginia.edu|accessdate=18 February 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Originally in the 1830s, the term had been associated with the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]].  The Whigs used a raccoon as its emblem, but also had a more tolerant attitude towards blacks than the other political factions.  The latter opinion is likely what transformed the term "coon" from mere political slang into a racial slur.&lt;ref&gt;Sotiroupoulos, 91.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is possible that the popularity of coon songs may be explained in part by their historical timing: coon songs arose precisely as the [[popular music]] [[music industry|business]] exploded in [[Tin Pan Alley]].&lt;ref name="d453"/&gt; However, James Dormon, a former professor of history and [[American studies]] at the [[University of Louisiana at Lafayette|University of Southwestern Louisiana]], has also suggested that coon songs can be seen as "a necessary sociopsychological mechanism for justifying [[racial segregation in the United States|segregation]] and subordination."&lt;ref name="d466"&gt;Dormon, 466.&lt;/ref&gt;  The songs portrayed Blacks as posing a threat to the American social order, and implied that they had to be controlled.&lt;ref name="d466"/&gt;

==Composers==
[[File:Allcoonslookaliketome.jpg|Sheet music to [[Ernest Hogan]]'s "[[Ernest Hogan#Creation of ragtime genre|All Coons Look Alike to Me]]".|thumb|180px]][[File:Mahoneygal.jpg|Sheet music to "Ma Honey Gal". Coon songs suggested that the most common living arrangement for Blacks was a "honey" relationship (unmarried [[cohabitation]]), rather than marriage.|180px|thumb]]
At the height of their popularity, "just about every songwriter in the country" was writing coon songs "to fill the seemingly insatiable demand".&lt;ref name="reublin"/&gt;  Writers of coon songs included some of the most important [[Tin Pan Alley]] composers, including [[Gus Edwards (songwriter)|Gus Edwards]], [[Fred Fisher]] (who wrote the 1905 "If the Man in the Moon Were a Coon", which sold three million copies),&lt;ref&gt;Lemons, 108.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Irving Berlin]].&lt;ref&gt;Hamm, 145–146.&lt;/ref&gt;  Even one of [[John Philip Sousa]]'s assistants, [[Arthur Pryor]], composed coon songs.&lt;ref name="reublin"/&gt;  (This was meant to ensure a steady supply to Sousa's band, which performed the songs and popularized several coon song melodies.&lt;ref name="reublin"/&gt;)

Many coon songs were written by whites, but some were written by African-Americans.&lt;ref name="l106"/&gt;  Important black composers of coon songs include [[Ernest Hogan]] (who wrote "[[All Coons Look Alike to Me]]", the most famous coon song);&lt;ref name="d459"&gt;Dormon, 459.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lemons, 105.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sam Lucas]] (who wrote the most racist early coon songs by modern standards);&lt;ref name="d452"/&gt; minstrel and songwriter Sidney L. Perrin (who wrote "Black Annie," "Dat's De Way to Spell Chicken," "Mamma's Little Pumpkin Colored Coons," "Gib Me Ma 15 cents," and "My Dinah"); [[Bob Cole (composer)|Bob Cole]] (who wrote dozens of songs, including "I Wonder What The Coon's Game Is?" and "No Coons Allowed"); and [[Bert Williams]] and [[George Walker (vaudeville)|George Walker]].&lt;ref&gt;Lemons, 107.&lt;/ref&gt;  Even classic [[ragtime]] composer [[Scott Joplin]] wrote at least one coon song (''I Am Thinking of my Pickaninny Days''), and may have composed the music for several more, using lyrics written by others.&lt;ref&gt;Blesh, Rudi and Harris, Janet; ''They All Played Ragtime''; Alfred P. Knopf;  New York:  1950.;  p.37.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==
Coon songs almost always aimed to be funny and incorporated the [[syncopated]] rhythms of [[ragtime]] music.&lt;ref name="d453"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Dvorak"/&gt;  A coon song's defining characteristic, however, was its [[African-American stereotypes|caricature of African Americans]]. In keeping with the older [[Minstrel show|minstrel]] image of blacks, coon songs often featured "[[Watermelon stereotype|watermelon]]- and chicken-loving rural buffoon[s]".&lt;ref name="d455"&gt;Dormon, 455.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, "blacks began to appear as not only ignorant and indolent, but also devoid of honesty or personal honor, given to drunkenness and gambling, utterly without ambition, sensuous, libidinous, even lascivious."&lt;ref name="d455"/&gt;  Blacks were portrayed as making money through [[gambling]], [[theft]], and [[hustling]], rather than working to earn a living,&lt;ref name="d455"/&gt; as in the Nathan Bivins song "Gimme Ma Money":

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;Last night I did go to a big Crap game,
How dem coons did gamble wuz a sin and a shame...
I'm gambling for my Sadie,
Cause she's my lady,
I'm a hustling coon, ... dat's just what I am.&lt;ref name="d456"&gt;Dormon, 456.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Coon songs portrayed blacks as "hot", in this context meaning promiscuous and libidinous.  They suggested that the most common living arrangement was a "honey" relationship (unmarried [[cohabitation]]), rather than marriage.&lt;ref name="d458"&gt;Dormon, 458.&lt;/ref&gt;

Blacks were portrayed as inclined toward acts of provocative violence.  [[Straight razor|Razors]] were often featured in the songs and came to symbolize blacks' wanton tendencies.&lt;ref name="d455"/&gt;  However, violence in the songs was uniformly directed at blacks instead of whites (perhaps to discharge the threatening notion of black violence amongst the coon songs' predominantly white consumers).  Hence, the spectre of black-on-white violence remained but an allusion.&lt;ref name="d460"&gt;Dormon, 460.&lt;/ref&gt;  The street-patrolling "[[bullying|bully]] coon" was often used as a stock character in coon songs.&lt;ref&gt;Dormon, 460–461.&lt;/ref&gt;

The songs showed the social threats that whites believed were posed by blacks.  [[Passing (racial identity)|Passing]] was a common theme,&lt;ref&gt;Dormon, 461.&lt;/ref&gt; and blacks were portrayed as seeking the status of whites, through education and money.&lt;ref&gt;Dormon, 462.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, blacks rarely, except during [[dream sequence]]s, actually succeeded at appearing white; they only aspired to do so.&lt;ref&gt;Dormon, 463.&lt;/ref&gt;

Coon songs were popular in [[vaudeville]] theater, where they were delivered by "coon shouters", who were typically White females.&lt;ref name="reublin"/&gt;  Notable coon shouters included [[Artie Hall]],&lt;ref&gt;Abbott, 17.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sophie Tucker]], [[May Irwin]], [[Mae West]], [[Fanny Brice]], [[Fay Templeton]], [[Lotta Crabtree]],  [[Marie Dressler]], [[Emma Carus]], [[Nora Bayes]], [[Clarice Vance]], [[Elsie Janis]], [[Trixie Friganza]], [[Eva Tanguay]] and [[Julia Gerity]].&lt;ref name="reublin"/&gt; [[File:Artie Hall.jpg|Portion of sheet music cover to "Jessamine" (c) 1906 Jerome H. Remick &amp; Co. NY, NY. [[Artie Hall]] was killed in the collapse of the Orpheus Theatre at San Francisco during the great earthquake of April 18, 1906 | thumb|180px]]

As with minstrel shows earlier, a whole genre of skits and shows grew up around coon songs, and often coon songs were featured in legitimate theater productions.&lt;ref name="reublin"/&gt;

==Effects on African-American music==
Coon songs contributed to the development and acceptance of authentic [[African-American music]].&lt;ref name="d467"&gt;Dormon, 467.&lt;/ref&gt;  Elements from coon songs were incorporated into turn-of-the-century African American folk songs, as was revealed by [[Howard W. Odum]]'s 1906-1908 [[ethnomusicology]] fieldwork.&lt;ref&gt;Abbott, 25–26.&lt;/ref&gt;  Similarly, coon songs lyrics influenced the vocabulary of the [[blues]], culminating with [[Bessie Smith]]'s singing in the 1920s.&lt;ref name="d467"/&gt;

Black songwriters and performers who participated in the creation of coon songs profited commercially, enabling them to go on to develop a new type of [[African American musical theater]] based at least in part on African-American traditions.&lt;ref name="d467"/&gt; Coon songs also contributed to the mainstream acceptance of [[ragtime]] music, paving the way for the acceptance of other African-American music.&lt;ref name="d467"/&gt;  [[Ernest Hogan]], when discussing his "[[Ernest Hogan#Creation of ragtime genre|All Coons Look Alike to Me]]" shortly before his death, commented:
{{quote|(That) song caused a lot of trouble in and out of show business, but it was also good for show business because at the time money was short in all walks of life. With the publication of that song, a new musical rhythm was given to the people. Its popularity grew and it sold like wildfire... That one song opened the way for a lot of colored and white songwriters. Finding the rhythm so great, they stuck to it ... and now you get hit songs without the word 'coon.' ... [Ragtime music] would have been lost to the world if I had not put it on paper.&lt;ref name="Dvorak"&gt;Peress, 39.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==In Britain==
{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2018}}
Coon songs became tremendously popular in Britain after the 1880s. The role of racial stereotyping in Britain was different from what it was in America, in that the theatre audiences listening to the song often did not see Black people on a day-to-day basis in their lives.

In Britain, the most important stars to popularize coon songs were [[Eugene Stratton]], [[G. H. Elliott]] and [[G. H. Chirgwin]]. "Coon imitators" singing these songs were a staple part of British music-hall until at least 1920. Initially reserved to male artists; however, a small number of women and children increasingly began to sing coon songs at the beginning of the twentieth century.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1232">'''DUAL''' is a general [[cognitive architecture]] integrating the [[connectionist]] and [[symbol]]ic approaches at the micro level. DUAL is based on decentralized representation and [[emergence|emergent computation]]. It was inspired by the [[Society of Mind]] idea proposed by [[Marvin Minsky]] but departs from the initial proposal in many ways. Computations in DUAL emerge from the interaction of many micro-agents each of which is hybrid symbolic/connectionist device. The agents exchange messages and activation via links that can be learnt and modified, they form coalitions which collectively represent concepts, episodes, and facts. 

Several models have been developed on the basis of DUAL. These include: [[AMBR]] (a model of analogy-making and memory), JUDGEMAP (a model of judgment), PEAN (a model of perception), etc.

DUAL is developed by a team at the [[New Bulgarian University]] led by [[Boicho Kokinov]]. The second version was co-authored by Alexander Petrov. The third version is co-authored by Georgi Petkov and Ivan Vankov.

'''Ecological economics''' (also called '''eco-economics''', '''ecolonomy''' or '''bioeconomics''' of [[Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen|Georgescu-Roegen]]) is both a [[transdisciplinary]] and an [[interdisciplinary]] field of academic research addressing the interdependence and [[coevolution]] of human [[economy|economies]] and natural [[ecosystem]]s, both intertemporally and spatially.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Anastasios Xepapadeas |year=2008 |url=http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/search_results?q=ecological+economics&amp;edition=current&amp;button_search=GO |title=Ecological economics |work=[[The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics]] 2nd Edition |publisher=Palgrave MacMillan }}&lt;/ref&gt; By treating the economy as a subsystem of Earth's larger ecosystem, and by emphasizing the preservation of [[natural capital]], the field of '''ecological economics''' is differentiated from [[environmental economics]], which is the [[mainstream economics|mainstream economic]] analysis of the environment.&lt;!-- &lt;ref&gt;http://www.eoearth.org/article/Environmental_and_ecological_economics Lead Author: Robert Nadeau Article Topics: Ecological economics and Environmental economics Last Updated: August 26, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jeroen C.J.M. van den Bergh (2001).

Ecological economics was founded in the 1980s as a modern discipline on the works of and interactions between various European and American academics (see the section on [[#History and development|History and development]] below). The related field of [[Green economy|green economics]] is, in general, a more politically applied form of the subject.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert C. Paehlke|Paehlke R.]] (1995).

According to ecological economist [[:de:Malte Michael Faber|Malte Faber]], ecological economics is defined by its focus on nature, justice, and time. Issues of [[intergenerational equity]], [[irreversibility]] of environmental change, [[uncertainty]] of long-term outcomes, and [[sustainable development]] guide ecological economic analysis and valuation.&lt;ref name=Faber2008&gt;Malte Faber.

==History and development==
The antecedents of ecological economics can be traced back to the [[Romantics]] of the 19th century as well as some [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] political economists of that era. Concerns over population were expressed by [[Thomas Malthus]], while [[John Stuart Mill]] predicted the [[Steady-state economy #John Stuart Mill's concept of the stationary state|desirability of the ''stationary state'' of an economy]]. Mill thereby anticipated later insights of modern ecological economists, but without having had their experience of the social and ecological costs of the [[Post–World War II economic expansion]]. In 1880, [[Marxian economics|Marxian]] economist [[Sergei Podolinsky]] attempted to theorize a [[labor theory of value]] based on [[embodied energy]]; his work was read and critiqued by [[Karl Marx|Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels|Engels]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bellamy Foster|first1=John|first2=Paul|last2=Burkett|title=Ecological Economics and Classical Marxism: The "Podolinsky Business" Reconsidered|journal=Organization &amp; Environment|date=March 2004|volume=Vol. 17, No. 1|pages=32-60|url=http://johnbellamyfoster.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2014/07/OandE-2004-Foster-Burkett-32-60.pdf|accessdate=31 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The debate on energy in economic systems can also be traced back to [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry|Nobel prize]]-winning [[radiochemistry|radiochemist]] [[Frederick Soddy]] (1877–1956). In his book ''[[Wealth, Virtual Wealth and Debt]]'' (1926), Soddy criticized the prevailing belief of the economy as a perpetual motion machine, capable of generating infinite wealth—a criticism expanded upon by later ecological economists such as Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen and Herman Daly.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/12/opinion/12zencey.html Zencey, Eric. (2009, April 12). Op-ed. ''New York Times'', p. WK9.] Accessed: December 23, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

European predecessors of ecological economics include [[K. William Kapp]] (1950)&lt;ref&gt;Kapp, K. W. (1950) ''The Social Costs of Private Enterprise''. New York: Shocken.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Karl Polanyi]] (1944)&lt;ref&gt;Polanyi, K. (1944) ''The Great Transformation''. New York/Toronto: Rinehart &amp; Company Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;, and [[Romania]]n economist [[Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen]] (1971). Georgescu-Roegen, who would later mentor Herman Daly at [[Vanderbilt University]], provided ecological economics with a modern conceptual framework based on the material and energy flows of economic production and [[Consumption (economics)|consumption]]. His ''magnum opus'', ''[[Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen#Magnum opus on The Entropy Law and the Economic Process|The Entropy Law and the Economic Process]]'' (1971), is credited by Daly as a fundamental text of the field, alongside Soddy's ''Wealth, Virtual Wealth and Debt''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Georgescu-Roegen |first=Nicholas |date=1971 |title=The Entropy Law and the Economic Process. |url=https://www.scribd.com/document/267519123/The-Entropy-Law-and-the-Economic-Process-by-Nicholas-Georgescu-Roegen-pdf |format=Full book accessible at Scribd |location=Cambridge, Massachusetts |publisher=Harvard University Press |isbn=0674257804 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some key concepts of what is now ecological economics are evident in the writings of [[Kenneth Boulding]] and [[E.F. Schumacher]], whose book ''[[Small Is Beautiful]] &amp;ndash; A Study of Economics as if People Mattered'' (1973) was published just a few years before the first edition of [[Herman Daly]]'s comprehensive and persuasive ''[[Steady-state economy#Herman Daly's concept of a steady-state economy|Steady-State Economics]]'' (1977).&lt;ref&gt;Schumacher, E.F. 1973.

Washington, D.C.: Island Press.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The first organized meetings of ecological economists occurred in the 1980s. These began in 1982, at the instigation of Lois Banner,&lt;ref&gt;Røpke, I. (2004) The early history of modern ecological economics. Ecological Economics 50(3-4): 293-314.&lt;/ref&gt; with a meeting held in Sweden (including [[Robert Costanza]], [[Herman Daly]], [[Charles A S Hall|Charles Hall]], Bruce Hannon, [[H.T. Odum]], and David Pimentel).&lt;ref name=EarlyHistory/&gt; Most were ecosystem ecologists or mainstream environmental economists, with the exception of Daly. In 1987, Daly and Costanza edited an issue of ''Ecological Modeling'' to test the waters. A book entitled ''Ecological Economics'', by [[Joan Martinez Alier|Juan Martinez-Alier]], was published later that year.&lt;ref name=EarlyHistory&gt;Costanza R. (2003). [http://www.ecoeco.org/pdf/costanza.pdf Early History of Ecological Economics and ISEE]. Internet Encyclopaedia of Ecological Economics.&lt;/ref&gt; 1989 saw the foundation of the [[International Society for Ecological Economics]] and publication of its journal, ''[[Ecological Economics (journal)|Ecological Economics]]'', by [[Elsevier]]. [[Robert Costanza]] was the first president of the society and first editor of the journal, which is currently edited by Richard Howarth. Other figures include ecologists [[C.S. Holling]] and [[H.T. Odum]], biologist Gretchen Daily, and physicist [[Robert Ayres (scientist)|Robert Ayres]]. In the [[Marxian economics|Marxian]] tradition, sociologist [[John Bellamy Foster]] and CUNY geography professor [[David Harvey (geographer)|David Harvey]] explicitly center ecological concerns in [[political economy]].

== Nature and ecology ==

{{Main article|Nature|Ecology}}

[[File:Diagram of natural resource flows.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2 |Natural resources flow through the economy and end up as waste and pollution]]

A simple [[circular flow of income]] diagram is replaced in ecological economics by a more complex flow diagram reflecting the input of solar energy, which sustains natural inputs and environmental services which are then used as units of [[Production (economics)|production]]. Once consumed, natural inputs pass out of the economy as pollution and waste. The potential of an environment to provide services and materials is referred to as an "environment's source function", and this function is depleted as resources are consumed or pollution contaminates the resources. The "sink function" describes an environment's ability to absorb and render harmless waste and pollution: when waste output exceeds the limit of the sink function, long-term damage occurs.&lt;ref name=Harris2006&gt;Harris J. (2006). ''Environmental and Natural Resource Economics: A Contemporary Approach''. Houghton Mifflin Company.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|8}} Some persistent pollutants, such as some organic pollutants and nuclear waste are absorbed very slowly or not at all; ecological economists emphasize minimizing "cumulative pollutants".&lt;ref name=Harris2006/&gt;{{rp|28}} Pollutants affect human health and the health of the ecosystem.

The economic value of natural capital and [[ecosystem services]] is accepted by mainstream environmental economics, but is emphasized as especially important in ecological economics. Ecological economists may begin by estimating how to maintain a stable environment before assessing the cost in dollar terms.&lt;ref name=Harris2006/&gt;{{rp|9}} Ecological economist [[Robert Costanza]] led an attempted valuation of the global ecosystem in 1997. Initially published in ''Nature'', the article concluded on $33 trillion with a range from $16 trillion to $54 trillion (in 1997, total global [[GDP]] was $27 trillion).&lt;ref name=Costanza1998&gt;{{cite journal | author = Costanza R | year = 1998 | title = The value of the world's ecosystem services and natural capital1 | journal = Ecological Economics | volume = 25 | issue = 1 | pages = 3–15 | doi = 10.1016/S0921-8009(98)00020-2 | url = http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0921800998000202|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Half of the value went to [[nutrient cycling]]. The open oceans, continental shelves, and estuaries had the highest total value, and the highest per-hectare values went to estuaries, swamps/floodplains, and seagrass/algae beds. The work was criticized by articles in ''[[Ecological Economics (journal)|Ecological Economics]]'' Volume 25, Issue 1, but the critics acknowledged the positive potential for economic valuation of the global ecosystem.&lt;ref name=Harris2006/&gt;{{rp|129}}

The Earth's [[carrying capacity]] is a central issue in ecological economics. Early economists such as [[Thomas Malthus]] pointed out the finite carrying capacity of the earth, which was also central to the MIT study ''[[Limits to Growth]]''. [[Diminishing returns]] suggest that productivity increases will slow if major technological progress is not made. Food production may become a problem, as [[erosion]], an impending [[water crisis]], and [[soil salinity]] (from [[irrigation]]) reduce the productivity of agriculture. Ecological economists argue that [[industrial agriculture]], which exacerbates these problems, is not [[sustainable agriculture]], and are generally inclined favorably to [[organic farming]], which also reduces the output of carbon.&lt;ref name=Harris2006/&gt;{{rp|26}}

Global [[wild fisheries]] are believed to have peaked and begun a decline, with valuable habitat such as estuaries in critical condition.&lt;ref name=Harris2006/&gt;{{rp|28}} The [[aquaculture]] or [[fish farm|farming]] of [[piscivorous]] fish, like [[salmon]], does not help solve the problem because they need to be fed products from other fish. Studies have shown that [[Aquaculture of salmon|salmon farming]] has major [[Salmon farming issues|negative impacts]] on wild salmon, as well as the [[forage fish]] that need to be caught to feed them.&lt;ref name="Salmon Run"&gt;

Since [[animal]]s are higher on the [[trophic level]], they are less efficient sources of food energy.

[[Global warming]] is now widely acknowledged as a major issue, with all national scientific academies [[scientific opinion on climate change|expressing agreement]] on the importance of the issue. As the population growth intensifies and energy demand increases, the world faces an [[energy crisis]]. Some economists and scientists forecast a global ecological crisis if energy use is not contained &amp;ndash; the [[Stern report]] is an example. The disagreement has sparked a vigorous debate on issue of [[discounting]] and intergenerational equity.

== Ethics ==
{{See also|Environmental ethics}}{{Renewable energy sources}}

[[Mainstream economics]] has attempted to become a value-free '[[hard and soft science|hard science]]', but ecological economists argue that value-free economics is generally not realistic. Ecological economics is more willing to entertain alternative conceptions of [[utility]], [[efficiency]], and [[cost-benefit analysis|cost-benefits]] such as positional analysis or multi-criteria analysis. Ecological economics is typically viewed as economics for [[sustainable development]],&lt;ref&gt;Soderbaum P. (2004).

Internet Encyclopaedia of Ecological Economics.&lt;/ref&gt; and may have goals similar to [[green politics]].

=== Green economics ===
In international, regional, and national policy circles, the concept of the ''green economy'' grew in popularity as a response to the financial predicament at first then became a vehicle for growth and development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bina|first=O.|date=2011|title=Promise and shortcomings of a green turn in recent policy responses to the ‘double crisis’|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/geo2.36|journal=Ecological Economics|volume=70|pages=2308–2316|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[https://www.unenvironment.org/explore-topics/green-economy United Nations Environment Program]'' (UNEP) defines a ‘green economy’ as one that focuses on the human aspects and natural influences and an economic order that can generate high-salary jobs. In 2011, its definition was further developed as the word ‘green’ is made to refer to an economy that is not only resourceful and well-organized but also impartial, guaranteeing an objective shift to an [https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/content/documents/126GER_synthesis_en.pdf economy that is low-carbon, resource-efficient, and socially-inclusive].

The ideas and studies regarding the green economy denote a fundamental shift for more effective, resourceful, environment-friendly and resource‐saving technologies that could lessen emissions and alleviate the adverse consequences of climate change, at the same time confront issues about resource exhaustion and grave environmental dilapidation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Janicke|first=M.|date=2012|title=‘Green growth’: from a growing eco‐industry to economic sustainability|url=|journal=Energy Policy|volume=28|pages=13-21|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As an indispensable requirement and vital precondition to realizing sustainable development, the [http://www.un.org/waterforlifedecade/pdf/green_economy_in_action_eng.pdf Green Economy] adherents robustly promote good governance. To boost local investments and foreign ventures, it is crucial to have a constant and foreseeable macroeconomic atmosphere. Likewise, such an environment will also need to be transparent and accountable. In the absence of a substantial and solid governance structure, the prospect of shifting towards a sustainable development route would be insignificant. In achieving a green economy, competent institutions and governance systems are vital in guaranteeing the efficient execution of strategies, guidelines, campaigns, and programmes. 

Shifting to a Green Economy demands a fresh mindset and an innovative outlook of doing business. It likewise necessitates new capacities, skills set from labor and professionals who can competently function across sectors, and able to work as effective components within multi-disciplinary teams. To achieve this goal, vocational training packages must be developed with focus on greening the sectors. Simultaneously, the educational system needs to be assessed as well in order to fit in the environmental and social considerations of various disciplines.&lt;ref&gt;UNEP, 2012.

=== Green politics ===

== Schools of thought ==
Various competing schools of thought exist in the field. Some are close to resource and environmental economics while others are far more heterodox in outlook. An example of the latter is the ''European Society for Ecological Economics''.  An example of the former is the Swedish ''Beijer International Institute of Ecological Economics.'' [[Clive Spash]] has argued for the classification of the ecological economics movement, and more generally work by different economic schools on the environment, into three main categories.  These are the mainstream new resource economists, the new environmental pragmatists,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.clivespash.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Spash_NEP_2009_EV.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and the more radical social ecological economists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.clivespash.org/2011_Spash_AJES_Social_Ecol_Econ.pdf |title=Spash, C.L.

== Differentiation from mainstream schools ==
Some ecological economists prioritise adding natural capital to the typical [[capital asset]] analysis of land, labor, and financial capital. These ecological economists then use tools from [[mathematical economics]] as in mainstream economics, but may apply them more closely to the natural world. Whereas mainstream economists tend to be technological optimists, ecological economists are inclined to be technological sceptics. They reason that the natural world has a limited carrying capacity and that its resources may run out. Since destruction of important environmental resources could be practically irreversible and catastrophic, ecological economists are inclined to justify cautionary measures based on the [[precautionary principle]].&lt;ref&gt;Costanza R. (1989). What is ecological economics? ''Ecological Economics'' '''1''':1-7. [http://www.uvm.edu/giee/publications/Costanza_EE_1989.pdf].&lt;/ref&gt;

The most cogent example of how the different theories treat similar assets is [[tropical rainforest]] ecosystems, most obviously the Yasuni region of [[Ecuador]].  While this area has substantial deposits of [[bitumen]] it is also one of the most diverse ecosystems on Earth and some estimates establish it has over 200 undiscovered medical substances in its genomes - most of which would be destroyed by logging the forest or mining the bitumen.  Effectively, the [[instructional capital]] of the genomes is undervalued by analyses which view the rainforest primarily as a source of wood, oil/tar and perhaps food. Increasingly the [[carbon credit]] for leaving the extremely carbon-intensive ("dirty") bitumen in the ground is also valued - the government of Ecuador set a price of US$350M for an oil lease with the intent of selling it to someone committed to never exercising it at all and instead preserving the rainforest.

While this natural capital and ecosystems services approach has proven popular amongst many it has also been contested as failing to address the underlying problems with mainstream economics, growth, market capitalism and monetary valuation of the environment.&lt;ref&gt;Martinez-Alier, J., 1994. Ecological economics and ecosocialism, in: O'Connor, M. (Ed.), Is Capitalism Sustainable? Guilford Press, New York, pp. 23-36&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Spash, C.L., Clayton, A.M.H., 1997.

Ecological Economics 25, 57-60&lt;/ref&gt;  Critiques concern the need to create a more meaningful relationship with Nature and the non-human world than evident in the instrumentalism of shallow ecology and the environmental economists [[commodification]] of everything external to the market system.&lt;ref&gt;O'Neill, J.F., 1993. Ecology, Policy and Politics: Human Well-Being and the Natural World. Routledge, London&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;O'Neill, J.F. (1997) Managing without prices: On the monetary valuation of biodiversity. Ambio 26, 546-550&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vatn, A., 2000. The environment as commodity. Environmental Values 9, 493-509&lt;/ref&gt;

== Topics ==
Among the topics addressed by ecological economics are methodology, allocation of resources, weak versus strong sustainability, energy economics, energy accounting and balance, environmental services, cost shifting, and modeling.

=== Methodology ===
{{Thermodynamics|cTopic=[[Laws of thermodynamics]]}}
A primary objective of ecological economics (EE) is to ground economic thinking and practice in physical reality, especially in the laws of physics (particularly the [[laws of thermodynamics]]) and in knowledge of biological systems.  It accepts as a goal the improvement of human well-being through development, and seeks to ensure achievement of this through planning for the sustainable development of ecosystems and societies. Of course the terms development and sustainable development are far from lacking controversy. [[Richard B. Norgaard]] argues traditional economics has hi-jacked the development terminology in his book ''Development Betrayed''.&lt;ref&gt;Norgaard, R. B. (1994) Development Betrayed: The End of Progress and a Coevolutionary Revisioning of the Future. London: Routledge&lt;/ref&gt;

Well-being in ecological economics is also differentiated from welfare as found in mainstream economics and the 'new welfare economics' from the 1930s which informs resource and environmental economics.  This entails a limited preference utilitarian conception of value i.e., Nature is valuable to our economies, that is because people will pay for its services such as clean air, clean water, encounters with wilderness, etc.

Ecological economics is distinguishable from [[neoclassical economics]] primarily by its assertion that the economy is embedded within an environmental system. Ecology deals with the energy and matter transactions of life and the Earth, and the human economy is by definition contained within this system. Ecological economists argue that [[neoclassical economics]] has ignored the environment, at best considering it to be a subset of the human economy.

The neoclassical view ignores much of what the natural sciences have taught us about the contributions of nature to the creation of wealth e.g., the planetary endowment of scarce matter and energy, along with the complex and biologically diverse ecosystems that provide goods and [[ecosystem services]] directly to human communities: micro- and macro-climate regulation, water recycling, water purification, storm water regulation, waste absorption, food and medicine production, pollination, protection from solar and cosmic radiation, the view of a starry night sky, etc.

There has then been a move to regard such things as [[natural capital]] and ecosystems functions as goods and services.&lt;ref&gt;Daily, G.C. 1997. ''Nature's Services: Societal Dependence on Natural Ecosystems''. Washington, D.C.: Island Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Millennium Ecosystem Assessment. 2005. ''Ecosystems and Human Well-Being: Biodiversity Synthesis''. Washington, D.C.: World Resources Institute.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, this is far from uncontroversial within ecology or ecological economics due to the potential for narrowing down values to those found in mainstream economics and the danger of merely regarding Nature as a commodity.  This has been referred to as ecologists 'selling out on Nature'.&lt;ref&gt;McCauley, D. J. (2006) Selling out on nature. Nature 443(7): 27-28&lt;/ref&gt;  There is then a concern that ecological economics has failed to learn from the extensive literature in [[environmental ethics]] about how to structure a plural value system.

=== Allocation of resources ===
[[File:Uneconomic Growth diagram.jpg|thumb|The marginal costs of a growing economy may gradually exceed the marginal benefits, however measured.]]
[[Resource economics|Resource]] and [[neoclassical economics]] focus primarily on the efficient allocation of resources and less on the two other problems of importance to ecological economics: [[Distribution (economics)|distribution]] ([[equity (economics)|equity]]), and the scale of the economy relative to the ecosystems upon which it relies.&lt;ref name="Daly"&gt;Daly, H. and Farley, J. 2004. ''Ecological Economics: Principles and Applications''. Washington: Island Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Ecological economics makes a clear distinction between growth (quantitative increase in economic output) and development (qualitative improvement of the [[quality of life]]), while arguing that [[neoclassical economics]] confuses the two. Ecological economists point out that beyond modest levels, increased per-capita [[consumption (economics)|consumption]] (the typical economic measure of "standard of living") may not always lead to improvement in human well-being, but may have harmful effects on the environment and broader societal well-being. This situation is sometimes referred to as [[uneconomic growth]] (see diagram above).

&lt;/imagemap&gt;

Ecological economics challenges the conventional approach towards natural resources, claiming that it undervalues natural capital by considering it as interchangeable with human-made capital—labor and technology.

The impending depletion of natural resources and increase of climate-changing greenhouse gasses should motivate us to examine how political, economic and social policies can benefit from alternative energy. Shifting dependence on fossil fuels with specific interest within just one of the above-mentioned factors easily benefits at least one other. For instance, photo voltaic (or solar) panels have a 15% efficiency when absorbing the sun's energy, but its construction demand has increased 120% within both commercial and residential properties. Additionally, this construction has led to a roughly 30% increase in work demands (Chen).

The potential for the substitution of man-made capital for natural capital is an important debate in ecological economics and the economics of sustainability.
There is a continuum of views among economists between the strongly neoclassical positions of [[Robert Solow]] and [[Martin Weitzman]], at one extreme and the [[Pessimism #Entropy pessimism|'entropy pessimists']], notably [[Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen]] and [[Herman Daly]], at the other.&lt;ref&gt;Ayres, R.U. 2007. On the practical limits of substitution. Ecological Economics 61: 115-128.&lt;/ref&gt;

Neoclassical economists tend to maintain that man-made capital can, in principle, replace all types of natural capital.  This is known as the [[Strong vs Weak sustainability|weak sustainability]] view, essentially that every technology can be improved upon or replaced by innovation, and that there is a substitute for any and all scarce materials.

At the other extreme, the [[Strong vs Weak sustainability|strong sustainability]] view argues that the stock of natural resources and ecological functions are irreplaceable.  From the premises of strong sustainability, it follows that [[economic policy]] has a [[fiduciary]] responsibility to the greater ecological world, and that sustainable development must therefore take a different approach to valuing natural resources and ecological functions.

Recently, Stanislav Shmelev developed a new methodology for the assessment of progress at the macro scale based on multi-criteria methods, which allows consideration of different perspectives, including strong and weak sustainability or conservationists vs industrialists and aims to search for a 'middle way' by providing a strong neo-Keynesian economic push without putting excessive pressure on the natural resources, including water or producing emissions, both directly and indirectly.&lt;ref&gt;Shmelev, S.E. 2012.

=== Energy economics ===
[[File:Cost and exergy for heating energy in Finland.jpg|thumb|275px|Exergy analysis can be performed to find connections between economic value and the physical world.

{{Main article|Energy economics}}
A key concept of energy economics is [[net energy gain]], which recognizes that all energy requires energy to produce.  To be useful the energy return on energy invested (''[[EROEI]]'') has to be greater than one.  The net energy gain from production coal, oil and gas has declined over time as the easiest to produce sources have been most heavily depleted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Energy and Resource Quality: The ecology of the Economic Process |last1=Hall |first1=Charles A.S. |authorlink=

Ecological economics generally rejects the view of [[energy economics]] that growth in the energy supply is related directly to well being, focusing instead on [[biodiversity]] and [[creativity]] - or natural capital and [[individual capital]], in the terminology sometimes adopted to describe these economically. In practice, ecological economics focuses primarily on the key issues of [[uneconomic growth]] and [[quality of life]]. Ecological economists are inclined to acknowledge that much of what is important in human well-being is not analyzable from a strictly economic standpoint and suggests an interdisciplinary approach combining social and natural sciences as a means to address this.

[[Thermoeconomics]] is based on the proposition that the role of energy in [[biological evolution]] should be defined and understood through the [[second law of thermodynamics]], but also in terms of such economic criteria as [[productivity]], [[Economic efficiency|efficiency]], and especially the costs and benefits (or profitability) of the various mechanisms for capturing and utilizing available energy to build biomass and do work.&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter A. Corning]] 1 *, Stephen J. Kline. (2000). [http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/abstract/71007254/ABSTRACT Thermodynamics, information and life revisited, Part II: Thermoeconomics and Control information ] Systems Research and Behavioral Science, Apr. 07, Volume 15, Issue 6, Pages 453 – 482&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter Corning|Corning, P.]] (2002). “[http://www.complexsystems.org/abstracts/thermoec.html Thermoeconomics – Beyond the Second Law] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080922072349/http://www.complexsystems.org/abstracts/thermoec.html |date=2008-09-22 }}” – source: www.complexsystems.org&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, thermoeconomics is often discussed in the field of ecological economics, which itself is related to the fields of sustainability and sustainable development.

[[Exergy]] analysis is performed in the field of [[industrial ecology]] to use energy more efficiently.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://exergy.se/goran/thesis/ |title=Exergy - a useful concept |author=Wall, Göran |publisher=Exergy.se |accessdate=2012-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''exergy'', was coined by [[Zoran Rant]] in 1956, but the concept was developed by [[Josiah Willard Gibbs|J. Willard Gibbs]]. In recent decades, utilization of exergy has spread outside of physics and engineering to the fields of industrial ecology, ecological economics, [[systems ecology]], and [[energetics]].

=== Energy accounting and balance ===
{{See also|Net energy gain}}

An [[Energy accounting|energy balance]] can be used to track energy through a system, and is a very useful tool for determining resource use and environmental impacts, using the First and Second laws of [[thermodynamics]], to determine how much energy is needed at each point in a system, and in what form that energy is a cost in various environmental issues.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}&lt;!-- &lt;ref name="Cutler" /&gt; --&gt; The energy accounting system keeps track of energy in, energy out, and non-useful energy versus [[work done]], and transformations within the system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://telstar.ote.cmu.edu/environ/m3/s3/05account.shtml |title=Environmental Decision making, Science and Technology |publisher=Telstar.ote.cmu.edu |accessdate=2012-12-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100105164509/http://telstar.ote.cmu.edu/environ/m3/s3/05account.shtml |archivedate=2010-01-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scientists have written and speculated on different aspects of energy accounting.&lt;ref&gt;Stabile, Donald R. "Veblen and the Political Economy of the Engineer: the radical thinker and engineering leaders came to technocratic ideas at the same time," ''American Journal of Economics and Sociology (45:1) 1986, 43-44.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ecosystem services and their valuation ===
{{see also|Ecosystem valuation|Price of life}}
Ecological economists agree that ecosystems produce enormous flows of goods and services to human beings, playing a key role in producing well-being. At the same time, there is intense debate about how and when to place values on these benefits&lt;ref&gt; Farley, Joshua. "Ecosystem services: The economics debate." Ecosystem services 1.1 (2012): 40-49. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoser.2012.07.002 &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kallis, Giorgos, Erik Gómez-Baggethun, and Christos Zografos. "To value or not to value? That is not the question." Ecological economics 94 (2013): 97-105. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolecon.2013.07.002&lt;/ref&gt;.

A study was carried out by Costanza and colleagues&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Costanza, R. |author2=d'Arge, R. |author3=de Groot, R. |author4=Farber, S. |author5=Grasso, M. |author6=Hannon, B. |author7=Naeem, S. |author8=Limburg, K. |author9=Paruelo, J. |author10=O'Neill, R.V. |author11=Raskin, R. |author12=Sutton, P. |author13=and van den Belt, M. |year=1997 |title=The value of the world's ecosystem services and natural capital |journal=Nature |volume=387 |issue=6630 |pages=253–260 |url=http://www.esd.ornl.gov/benefits_conference/nature_paper.pdf |doi=10.1038/387253a0 |bibcode=1997Natur.387..253C |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120730185431/http://www.esd.ornl.gov/benefits_conference/nature_paper.pdf |archivedate=2012-07-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; to determine the 'value' of the services provided by the environment. This was determined by averaging values obtained from a range of studies conducted in very specific context and then transferring these without regard to that context.  Dollar figures were averaged to a per hectare number for different types of ecosystem e.g. wetlands, oceans. A total was then produced which came out at 33 trillion US dollars (1997 values), more than twice the total [[GDP]] of the world at the time of the study.  This study was criticized by pre-ecological and even some [[Environmental economics|environmental economists]] - for being inconsistent with assumptions of [[financial capital]] [[valuation (finance)|valuation]] - and ecological economists - for being inconsistent with an ecological economics focus on biological and physical indicators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Norgaard, R.B.  |author2=Bode, C. |year=1998|title= Next, the value of God, and other reactions|journal=Ecological Economics|volume= 25|pages= 37–39|doi=10.1016/s0921-8009(98)00012-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reducing human bodies to financial values is a necessary part of mainstream economics and not always in the direct terms of [[insurance]] or [[wages]].  Economics, in principle, assumes that conflict is reduced by agreeing on voluntary contractual relations and prices instead of simply fighting or coercing or tricking others into providing goods or services.  In doing so, a provider agrees to surrender time and take bodily risks and other (reputation, financial) risks.  Ecosystems are no different from other bodies economically except insofar as they are far less replaceable than typical labour or commodities.

Despite these issues, many ecologists and conservation biologists are pursuing [[ecosystem valuation]]. [[Biodiversity]] measures in particular appear to be the most promising way to reconcile financial and ecological values, and there are many active efforts in this regard.  The growing field of [[biodiversity finance]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.socialedge.org/features/opportunities/archive/2008/02/23/weblogentry.2008-02-20.6191038944 SocialEdge.org.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090215083840/http://www.socialedge.org/features/opportunities/archive/2008/02/23/weblogentry.2008-02-20.6191038944 |date=2009-02-15 }} Accessed: December 23, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; began to emerge in 2008 in response to many specific proposals such as the Ecuadoran Yasuni proposal&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sosyasuni.org/en/News/Ecuadors-Oil-Change-An-Exporters-Historic-Proposal.html] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080621054850/http://www.sosyasuni.org/en/News/Ecuadors-Oil-Change-An-Exporters-Historic-Proposal.html|date=June 21, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.multinationalmonitor.org/mm2007/092007/koenig.html Multinational Monitor, 9/2007.] Accessed: December 23, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; or similar ones in the [[Republic of the Congo|Congo]].  US news outlets treated the stories as a "threat"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cnn.com/2007/BUSINESS/12/10/ecuador.oil.ap/ |title=Ecuador threat to drill jungle oil|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081218035742/http://www.cnn.com/2007/BUSINESS/12/10/ecuador.oil.ap/|archivedate=December 18, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; to "drill a park"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory?id=3980994 |title=International News &amp;#124; World News - ABC News |publisher=Abcnews.go.com |date=4 June 2012 |accessdate=2012-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; reflecting a previously dominant view that NGOs and governments had the primary responsibility to protect ecosystems.  However [[Peter Barnes (entrepreneur)|Peter Barnes]] and other commentators have recently argued that a guardianship/trustee/commons model is far more effective and takes the decisions out of the political realm.

Commodification of other ecological relations as in [[carbon credit]] and direct payments to farmers to preserve [[ecosystem services]] are likewise examples that enable private parties to play more direct roles protecting biodiversity, but is also controversial in ecological economics&lt;ref&gt;Spash, Clive L. "The brave new world of carbon trading." New Political Economy 15.2 (2010): 169-195 &lt;/ref&gt;.  The [[United Nations]] [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] achieved near-universal agreement in 2008&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.panna.org/jt/agAssessment |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-06-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080621193253/http://www.panna.org/jt/AgAssessment |archivedate=2008-06-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; that such payments directly valuing ecosystem preservation and encouraging [[permaculture]] were the only practical way out of a food crisis.  The holdouts were all English-speaking countries that export [[GMO]]s and promote "[[free trade]]" agreements that facilitate their own control of the world transport network: The US, UK, Canada and Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/opinion/main.jhtml?xml=/opinion/2008/04/17/do1702.xml | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | title=GM crops can save us from food shortages | first=Bill | last=Emmott | date=April 17, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Not 'externalities', but cost shifting ===

Ecological economics is founded upon the view that the neoclassical economics (NCE) assumption that environmental and community costs and benefits are mutually canceling ''"[[externalities]]"'' is not warranted. [[Joan Martinez Alier]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Costanza|first=Robert|title=Getting Down to Earth: Practical Applications of Ecological Economics|year=1996|publisher=Island Press|location=Washington, D.C.|isbn=1559635037|author2=Segura, Olman |author3=Olsen, Juan Martinez-Alier }}&lt;/ref&gt; for instance shows that the bulk of consumers are automatically excluded from having an impact upon the prices of commodities, as these consumers are future generations who have not been born yet.  The assumptions behind future discounting, which assume that future goods will be cheaper than present goods, has been criticized by David Pearce&lt;ref&gt;Pearce, David "Blueprint for a Green Economy"&lt;/ref&gt; and by the recent [[Stern Report]] (although the Stern report itself does employ discounting and has been criticized for this and other reasons by ecological economists such as [[Clive Spash]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clivespash.org/EE2007_SpashonStern.pdf |title=Spash, C. L. (2007) The economics of climate change impacts à la Stern: Novel and nuanced or rhetorically restricted? Ecological Economics 63(4): 706-713 |format=PDF |accessdate=2012-12-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140202105133/http://www.clivespash.org/EE2007_SpashonStern.pdf |archivedate=2014-02-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Concerning these externalities, some like the eco-businessman [[Paul Hawken]] argue an orthodox economic line that the only reason why goods produced unsustainably are usually cheaper than goods produced sustainably is due to a hidden subsidy, paid by the non-monetized human environment, community or future generations.&lt;ref&gt;Hawken, Paul (1994) "The Ecology of Commerce" (Collins)&lt;/ref&gt;  These arguments are developed further by Hawken, Amory and Hunter Lovins to promote their vision of an environmental capitalist utopia in ''[[Natural Capitalism: Creating the Next Industrial Revolution]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Hawken, Paul; Amory and Hunter Lovins (2000) "Natural Capitalism: Creating the Next Industrial Revolution" (Back Bay Books)&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast, ecological economists, like Joan Martinez-Alier, appeal to a different line of reasoning.&lt;ref&gt;Martinez-Alier, Joan (2002) The Environmentalism of the Poor: A Study of Ecological Conflicts and Valuation. Cheltenham, Edward Elgar&lt;/ref&gt;  Rather than assuming some (new) form of capitalism is the best way forward, an older ecological economic critique questions the very idea of internalizing externalities as providing some corrective to the current system. The work by [[Karl William Kapp]] explains why the concept of "externality" is a misnomer.&lt;ref&gt;Kapp, Karl William (1963) The Social Costs of Business Enterprise. Bombay/London, Asia Publishing House.&lt;/ref&gt; In fact the modern business enterprise operates on the basis of shifting costs onto others as normal practice to make profits.&lt;ref&gt;Kapp, Karl William (1971) Social costs, neo-classical economics and environmental planning. The Social Costs of Business Enterprise, 3rd edition. K. W. Kapp. Nottingham, Spokesman: 305-318&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charles Eisenstein]] has argued that this method of privatising profits while socialising the costs through externalities, passing the costs to the community, to the natural environment or to future generations is inherently destructive.&lt;ref&gt;Eisenstein , Charles (2011), "Sacred Economics: Money, Gift and Society in an Age in Transition" (Evolver Editions)&lt;/ref&gt; As social ecological economist [[Clive Spash]] has noted, externality theory fallaciously assumes environmental and social problems are minor aberrations in an otherwise perfectly functioning efficient economic system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Spash, Clive L. |date= 16 July 2010 |title= The brave new world of carbon trading |journal= New Political Economy |volume= 15 |pages=169–195 |publisher= Taylor and Francis Online |issue= 2 |doi= 10.1080/13563460903556049 |url= http://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/19114/1/MPRA_paper_19114.pdf }} Copy also available at {{cite web|url=http://www.clivespash.org/2010_Spash_Brave_New_World_NPE.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-09-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130510185658/http://clivespash.org/2010_Spash_Brave_New_World_NPE.pdf |archivedate=2013-05-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Internalizing the odd externality does nothing to address the structural systemic problem and fails to recognize the all pervasive nature of these supposed 'externalities'.

=== Ecological-economic modeling ===

[[Mathematical model]]ing is a powerful tool that is used in ecological economic analysis. Various approaches and techniques include:&lt;ref&gt;Proops, J., and Safonov, P. (eds.) (2004), [http://www.e-elgar.co.uk/bookentry_main.lasso?id=2951 Modelling in Ecological Economics], Edward Elgar&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Faucheux, S., Pearce, D., and Proops, J. (eds.) (1995), Models of Sustainable Development, Edward Elgar&lt;/ref&gt; [[evolutionary]], [[input/output model|input-output]], neo-Austrian modeling, [[entropy]] and [[thermodynamic]] models,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Unity of Science and Economics: A New Foundation of Economic Theory|last = Chen|first = Jing|publisher = Springer|year = 2015|isbn = |location = https://www.springer.com/us/book/9781493934645|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[multi-criteria decision analysis|multi-criteria]], and [[agent-based]] modeling, the environmental [[Kuznets curve]], and [[Stock-Flow consistent model]] frameworks. [[System dynamics]] and [[GIS]] are techniques applied, among other, to spatial dynamic landscape simulation modeling.&lt;ref&gt;Costanza, R., and Voinov, A. (eds.) (2004), Landscape Simulation Modeling.  A Spatially Explicit, Dynamic Approach, Springer-Verlag New-York, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Voinov|first=Alexey|title=Systems science and modeling for ecological economics|year=2008|publisher=Elsevier Academic Press|location=Amsterdam|isbn=0080886175|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Matrix accounting methods of Christian Felber provide a more sophisticated method for identifying "the common good"&lt;ref&gt;Felber, Christian (2012), "La economia del bien commun" (Duestro)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==

Assigning monetary value to natural resources such as [[biodiversity]], and the emergent [[ecosystem services]] is often viewed as a key process in influencing economic practices, policy, and decision-making.&lt;ref&gt;Mace GM. Whose conservation? Science (80- ). 2014 Sep 25;345(6204):1558–60.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dasgupta P. Nature’s role in sustaining economic development. Philos Trans R Soc Lond B Biol Sci. 2010 Jan 12;365(1537):5–11.&lt;/ref&gt; While this idea is becoming more and more accepted among ecologists and conservationist, some argue that it is inherently false.
 
McCauley argues that ecological economics and the resulting ecosystem service based conservation can be harmful.&lt;ref&gt;McCauley D. Selling out on nature. Nature. 2006;443(September):7–8.&lt;/ref&gt; He describes four main problems with this approach:

Firstly, it seems to be assumed that all ecosystem services are financially beneficial. This is undermined by a basic characteristic of ecosystems: they do not act specifically in favour of any single species. While certain services might be very useful to us, such as [[coastal protection]] from [[hurricanes]] by [[mangrove]]s for example, others might cause financial or personal harm, such as wolves hunting [[cattle]].&lt;ref&gt;Mech LD. The Challenge and Opportunity of Recovering Wolf Populations. Conserv Biol. 1995 Apr;9(2):270–8&lt;/ref&gt; The complexity of Eco-systems makes it challenging to weigh up the value of a given species. Wolves play a critical role in regulating prey populations; the absence of such an apex predator in the Scottish Highlands has caused the over population of deer, preventing afforestation, which increases the risk of flooding and damage to property.
 
Secondly, allocating monetary value to nature would make its conservation reliant on markets that fluctuate. This can lead to [[devaluation]] of services that were previously considered financially beneficial. Such is the case of the bees in a forest near former [[coffee plantation]]s in Finca Santa Fe, [[Costa Rica]]. The [[pollination]] services were valued to over US$60,000 a year, but soon after the study, coffee prices dropped and the fields were replanted with pineapple.&lt;ref&gt;Ricketts TH, Daily GC, Ehrlich PR, Michener CD. Economic value of tropical forest to coffee production. Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2004 Aug 24;101(34):12579–82&lt;/ref&gt; Pineapple does not require bees to be pollinated, so the value of their service dropped to zero.

Thirdly, conservation programmes for the sake of financial benefit underestimate human ingenuity to invent and replace ecosystem services by artificial means. McCauley argues that such proposals are deemed to have a short lifespan as the history of [[technology]] is about how Humanity developed [[artificial]] alternatives to nature’s services and with time passing the cost of such services tend to decrease. This would also lead to the devaluation of [[ecosystem services]].

Lastly, it should not be assumed that conserving ecosystems is always financially beneficial as opposed to alteration. In the case of the introduction of the [[Nile perch]] to [[Lake Victoria]], the ecological consequence was decimation of native [[fauna]]. However, this same event is praised by the local communities as they gain significant financial benefits from trading the fish.

McCauley argues that, for these reasons, trying to convince decision-makers to conserve nature for [[monetary]] reasons is not the path to be followed, and instead appealing to morality is the ultimate way to campaign for the protection of nature.

[[Embodied cognition]] occurs when an organism’s sensorimotor capacities (ability of the body to respond to its senses with movement), body and environment play an important role in thinking. The way in which a person’s body and their surroundings interacts also allows for specific brain functions to develop and in the future to be able to act.&lt;ref name=Cowart&gt;Cowart, M. (2005, Jul. 8 ). Embodied Cognition. http://www.iep.utm.edu/embodcog/&lt;/ref&gt;  This means that not only does the mind influence the body’s movements, but the body also influences the abilities of the mind, also termed the [[Bi-directional hypothesis of language and action|bi-directional hypothesis]].   
There are three generalizations that are assumed to be true relating to embodied cognition.  A person's [[motor system]] (that controls movement of the body) is activated when (1) they observe manipulable objects, (2) process action verbs, and (3) observe another individual's movements.&lt;ref&gt;Mahon, B. Z, and A. Caramazza. (2008). A critical look at the embodied cognition hypothesis and a new proposal. Journal of Physiology - Paris, 102 pp. 59–70.&lt;/ref&gt;

Embodied [[semantics]] is one of two theories concerning the location and processing of sensory motors inputs within the human brain. The theory of embodied semantics involves the existence of specialized hubs where the meaning of a word is tied with the sensory motor processing unit associated with the word meaning. For example, the concept of kicking would be represented in the sensory motor areas that control kicking actions.&lt;ref name = Rueschemeyer&gt;Rueschemeyer, S. et al. (2010). Effects of Intentional Motor Actions on Embodied Language Processing. Experimental Psychology, 57 (4), pp. 260−66. doi:10.1027/1618-3169/a000031&lt;/ref&gt;   As a result, the theory assumes that individuals must possess a body to understand English.

== Neural Circuitry ==
The overlap between various semantic categories with sensory motor areas suggests that a common mechanism is used by neurons to process action, perception, and semantics. The correlation principle states that neurons that fire together, wire together. Also, neurons out of sync, delink. When an individual pronounces a word, the activation pattern for articulatory motor systems of the speaker leads to activation of auditory and [[Somatosensory system|somatosensory]] systems due to self-perceived sounds and movements. If a word meaning is grounded in the visual shapes of the objects, the word form circuit is active together with neural activity in the ventral-temporal visual stream related to processing of visual object information. Correlation learning links the word and object circuits, resulting in an embodied object-semantic relationship.

==Semantic Hubs==
A semantic hub represents a focal point in the brain where all semantic information pertaining to a specific word is integrated. For example, the color, shape, size, smell, and sound associated with the word “cat” would be integrated at the same semantic hub. Some candidate regions for semantic hubs include:
# Inferior Frontal Cortex: the anterior part of Broca’s area and adjacent tissue in the left Inferior Frontal Cortex including Brodmann’s areas 44, 45, and 47 are activated for semantic processing and functional changes.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
# Superior Temporal Cortex: contains Wernicke’s area which controls the classic posterior language area in and adjacent to the superior temporal gyrus and sulcus. This area is thought to be a semantic processor on the basis of lesion, perfusion, and imaging data.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
# Inferior Parietal Cortex: angular and adjacent to supramarginal gyrus in inferior parietal cortex is thought to be most strongly activated during semantic processing of cross-modal spatial and temporal configurations.
# Inferior and middle temporal cortex: a general semantic binding site between words and their meaning in left or bilateral medial/inferior temporal cortex.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
# Anterior temporal cortex: thought to be involved in semantic dementia. which is a severe and specific semantic deficit characterized by lesions to both temporal poles.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
Semantic integration mechanisms involve various hub sites listed above, which contradicts the idea that there is one center where all integration occurs. However, each individual hub is compliant with the amodal model. Collectively, all of the hubs provide evidence for the theory that there are areas within the brain where emotional, sensory, and motor information all converge in one area.

==Semantic Category Specificity==
Each potential semantic hub is activated to a specific degree according to the category that the perceived word belongs to. For example, lesions to each of the five potential hubs do not affect all words. Instead, experimental data determines that one semantic category suffers more than another as it pertains to the word.
# Left Inferior Frontal Cortex and bilateral frontocentral motor systems: these two areas are strongly activated in response to action related words or phrases. Lesions to these two areas produces impairments in the processing of action related words and action related concepts.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
# Bilateral superior temporal Cortex: this area is strongly activated in response to words related to sounds. Lesions to this area produce impairment in sound word processing.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
# Left Inferior Parietal Cortex: especially near the supramarginal gyrus, this area is activated by spatial language. Lesions to the Inferior Parietal Cortex produced impairment involving spatial language such as prepositions.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
# Medial/Inferior Temporal Cortex: this area is strongly activated by category-specific words animals, tools, person’s names, color, and form. Lesions show impairment in category-specific words for these categories as well.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
# Anterior Temporal Cortex: this area is associated with processing the differences between semantic categories.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
Some of the category differences are thought to be produced by the adjacent hubs. For example, category specificity is greatest close to the piriform and anterior insular olfactory cortex. Here, odor words such as “cinnamon” lead to greater activation than control words. In the gustatory cortex in the anterior insula and frontal operculum, taste words such as “sugar” lead to a stronger activation.

==Experiential Trace Hypothesis==
Experiential Trace Hypothesis states that each time an individual interacts with the world, traces of that particular experience are left in our brain.&lt;ref name = ZwannPecher&gt;Zwaan R.A. &amp; Pecher, D. The grounding of cognition: The role of perception and action in memory, language, and thinking. Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  These traces can be accessed again when a person thinks of words or sentences that remind them of that experience.  Additionally, these traces in our brain are linked to the action that they are related to.&lt;ref name = ZwannPecher /&gt;   Words and sentences become those cues that retrieve these traces from our mind.  Researchers have studied if the previous experience with a word, such as its location (up or down) in space, affects how people understand and then respond to that word.&lt;ref name = Lachmair&gt;Lachmair, M. et al. (2011). Root versus roof: automatic activation of location information during word processing. Psychonomic Bulletin &amp; Review, 18 pp. 1180–88. doi:10.3758/s13423-001-0158-x&lt;/ref&gt;  In one experiment, researchers hypothesized that if reading an object word also activates a location that is linked to that noun, then the following action response should be compatible with that association.&lt;ref name = Lachmair /&gt;  They found that participants were faster to push a button higher than another button when the word was associated with being "up" or "above" than when the button was lower than the other for words associated with "up" and "above".  The results of this study displayed that participants were faster to respond when the location of the word and the action they had to perform were similar.  This demonstrates that language processing and action are connected.  This research also found that the location information of a word is automatically activated after seeing the word.&lt;ref name = Lachmair /&gt;  In a similar study, it was discovered that participants were equally as fast at responding to words that were associated with either an upward or downward location when the buttons to respond to these words were horizontal – meaning that the experiential trace effect was ruled out when the responding action did not link to either of the locations that were activated.&lt;ref name="Zwann"&gt;Zwann, R. A. (2002). Language Comprehenders Mentally Represent the Shape of Objects. Psychological Science, 13 (2), pp. 168–71&lt;/ref&gt;

===Experiential-Simulation Theory of Language Understanding===
Some theorists have proposed an experiential-simulation approach of language understanding. They argue that previous experiential traces related to a word may be reactivated at a later stage when accessing the meaning of the same word. This has been highlighted through the example of encountering the word ‘airplane’ in a situation where someone points to an airplane in the sky, thus making one look upwards. These experiential traces, e.g. ‘looking upwards’ are later reactivated when accessing the meaning of the word ‘airplane'. Similarly, another example might be when a person accesses the meaning of the word ‘snail’, they might also access experiential traces associated with this word, e.g. ‘looking downwards’ (likely towards the ground).&lt;ref&gt;Zwaan, R. A., &amp; Madden, C. J. (2005). Embodied sentence comprehension. Grounding cognition: The role of perception and action in memory, language, and thinking, 224-245.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Language Comprehension and Motor Systems Involved in Action==

===Concrete verbs===
As a result of previous experience to certain words, several studies have found that the action associated with a certain word is also activated in the motor cortices when processing that same word. For example, using event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), it was discovered that exposure to concrete action verbs referring to face, arm, or leg actions (e.g., to lick, pick, kick) activated motor regions that are stimulated when making actions with the foot, hand, or mouth.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Hauk, O., Johnsrude, I., &amp; Pulvermüller, F. (2004). Somatotopic representation of action words in human motor and premotor cortex. Neuron, 41(2), 301-307.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Abstract verbs===
However, findings are not as clear cut when abstract verbs are involved. Embodied theories of language comprehension assume that abstract concepts, as well as concrete ones, are grounded in the sensorimotor system (Jirak et al., 2010).&lt;ref&gt;Jirak, D., Menz, M. M., Buccino, G., Borghi, A. M., &amp; Binkofski, F. (2010). Grasping language–A short story on embodiment. Consciousness and Cognition, 19(3), 711-720.&lt;/ref&gt; Some studies have investigated the activation of motor cortices using abstract and also concrete verbs, examining the stimulation of the motor cortices when comprehending literal action verbs (concrete) vs. the metaphorical usage of the same action verbs (abstract). One such study used fMRI to study participants whilst they viewed actions performed by the mouth, hand or foot, and read literal and metaphorical sentences related to the mouth hand or foot. This study found activation in the premotor cortex for literal action (e.g. “grasping the scissors”) but not for metaphorical usage (e.g. “grasping the idea”).&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Aziz-Zadeh, L., Wilson, S. M., Rizzolatti, G., &amp; Iacoboni, M. (2006). Congruent embodied representations for visually presented actions and linguistic phrases describing actions. Current Biology, 16(18), 1818-1823.&lt;/ref&gt; These findings suggest that the assumption of embodied theories that abstract concepts, as well as concrete ones, are grounded in the sensorimotor system may not be true.

However, in contrast, other research has found motor cortex activation for the metaphorical usage of action verbs. One such study investigated cortical activation during comprehension of literal and idiomatic sentences using Magnetoencephalography (MEG). During a silent reading task, participants were presented with stimuli which included both literal and metaphorical arm-related action verbs, e.g. “Mary caught the fish” versus “Mary caught the sun”, and also literal and metaphorical leg-related action verbs, e.g. “Pablo jumped on the armchair” versus “Pablo jumped on the bandwagon”. This study found that processing of abstract verbs (idioms in this case) did indeed activate motor regions of the brain, activating anterior fronto-temporal activity very early compared to literal verbs.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Boulenger, V., Shtyrov, Y., &amp; Pulvermüller, F. (2012). When do you grasp the idea? MEG evidence for instantaneous idiom understanding. Neuroimage, 59(4), 3502-3513.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Embodied Semantics Using fMRI for Concrete and Abstract Words===
Hauk and colleagues found that reading words associated with foot, hand, or mouth actions (examples: kick, pick, lick) activated by motor areas adjacent or overlapping with areas activated by making actions with the hand, foot, or mouth.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Additionally, neurolinguist Tettmanti and colleagues found that listening to action related sentences activated the premotor cortex in a somatotopic fashion.&lt;ref name="Rueschemeyer" /&gt; Example: leg sentences showed premotor activity dorsal to hand sentences dorsal to mouth sentences.

Aziz-Zadeh and colleagues localized foot, hand, and mouth premotor regions of interest in each subject by having subjects watch actions associated with each effector and read phrases associated with the foot, hand, and mouth. In each subject, regions most activated for watching a foot action were also most active for language related to foot actions. The same was true for the hand and mouth. Rizzolatti and colleagues have suggested that action plan (manipulating, reaching) is more important than the actual effector involved.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Other studies have investigated activation of the motor system during comprehension of concrete and abstract sentences. Using Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) and a behavioural paradigm, one study investigated whether listening to action-related sentences activated activity within the motor cortices. This was investigated using Motor Evoked Potentials (MEPs) from the TMS which were recorded from hand muscles when stimulating the hand motor area, and from foot and leg muscles when stimulating the foot motor area. Participants were presented with sentences relating to hand or foot actions. As control, participants listened to sentences containing abstract content. The study found there was indeed activation of the motor cortices whilst listening to sentences expressing foot/leg and hand/arm actions. This activation specifically concerned the areas of the motor system ‘where the effector involved in the processed sentence is motorically represented’ (pp.&amp;nbsp;360). Specifically, the results showed that listening to hand-action-related sentences prompted a decrease of MEP amplitude recorded from hand muscles and listening to foot-action-related sentences prompted a decrease of MEP amplitude recorded from foot muscle.&lt;ref&gt;Buccino, G., Riggio, L., Melli, G., Binkofski, F., Gallese, V., &amp; Rizzolatti, G. (2005). Listening to action-related sentences modulates the activity of the motor system: a combined TMS and behavioral study. Cognitive Brain Research, 24(3), 355-363.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Embodied Semantics in BA44 ==
Aziz-Zadeh found that although both action observation and reading phrases about actions caused activity in premotor and prefrontal regions in the vicinity of Broca’s area, the activated regions largely did not overlap. Activations for reading phrases were anterior and medial to activations for action observation.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Aziz-Zadeh’s research contradicts that of Hamzei who stressed the overlap of language and action observation activations in the inferior frontal gyrus. However, the difference in results most likely was due to the difference in language tasks. Hamzei used a verb generation task that caused widespread activation in the inferior frontal gyrus and the premotor cortex. The action observation task led to a small activation area within the larger activation area. Therefore, Hamzei noticed the overlap between areas. Aziz-Zadeh used a less extensive frontal activation task which allowed for areas activated by reading and by action observation to be clearly distinguished.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Action-Sentence Compatibility Effect (ACE)==
''See also:'' [[Bi-directional hypothesis of language and action|The Bi-Directional Hypothesis of Language and Action]]

Sentence processing can facilitate activation of motor systems based on the actions referred to in the sentence.  In one study, researchers asked participants to make judgments on whether a sentence was sensible or not.  For example, "You handed Courtney the notebook" versus "Courtney handed you the notebook".  They asked participants in one condition to push a button farther away from their body if the sentence was logical and a button close to their body when it wasn't logical.  The results of this study demonstrated that participants were faster at pushing the "sentence is logical" button when the action in the sentence matched the action required by them to push the correct button.&lt;ref name="Havas"&gt;Havas, D. A. et al. (2007). Emotion simulation during language comprehension. Psychonomic Bulletin &amp; Review, 14 (3), pp. 436−41.&lt;/ref&gt;  This means if the sentence read "you handed Courtney the notebook", the participants were faster to push the button that was farther away from them when this button meant the sentence was logical.   The depicted motion in these sentences affected the amount of time required to understand the sentences that described the motion that is in the same direction.  This effect has been shown to apply to sentences that describe concrete actions (putting a book on a shelf) as well as more abstract actions (you told the story to the policeman).&lt;ref name="GlenbergK"&gt;Glenberg, A. M, and M. Kaschak. (2002). Grounding Language in Action. Psychnomic Bulletin &amp; Review, 9 (3), pp. 558–65.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other studies have tried to understand the ACE phenomenon by examining the modulation of motor resonance during language comprehension. In one study participants were asked to read sentences containing a frame of between one and three words. The participants had to rotate a knob, in one direction for half of the experiment and in the other direction for the other half. Each 5° of rotation induced the presentation of a new frame. Each of the sentences described actions involving manual rotation. In these, the rotation direction would or would not match the rotation direction implied by the sentence. Earlier studies, such as that by Glenberg &amp; Kaschak (2002), examined motor resonance in responses to sentences presumably given after the sentence was read. In contrast, results of this study revealed that motor resonance had dissipated before the end of the sentence, with motor resonance occurring on the verb. This study made use of comprehension questions rather than sensibility sentences. The researchers have argued that this created a more naturalistic reading situation, so it could be argued that the results of this study are deemed more suitable because they are in regards to more naturalistic language. Overall, the researchers have concluded that motor resonance is quite immediate and short-lived and that duration of the effect is modified by linguistic context.&lt;ref&gt;Zwaan, R. A., &amp; Taylor, L. J. (2006). Seeing, acting, understanding: motor resonance in language comprehension. Journal of Experimental Psychology: General, 135(1), 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

Neurophysiological evidence has also been presented to prove an ACE. This research used a behavioural paradigm as well as Event-Related Potential (ERP) to record brain activity, allowing the researchers to explore the neural brain markers of the ACE paradigm in semantic processing and motor responses. ERP was particularly beneficial in helping the researchers to investigate the [[Bi-directional hypothesis of language and action|bi-directional hypothesis of action-sentence comprehension]], which proposes that language processing facilitates movement and movement also facilitates language comprehension. In the study participants listened to sentences describing an action that involved an open hand, a closed hand or no manual action. They were then required to press a button to indicate their understanding of the sentence. Each participant was assigned a hand-shape, either closed or open, which was required to activate the button. As well as two groups (closed or open hand-shapes), there were three different categories relating to hand-shape: compatible, incompatible and neutral. Behavioural results from the study showed that participants responded quicker when the hand-shape required to press the response-button was compatible with the hand-shape inferred by the sentence. ERP results provided evidence to support the bi-directional hypothesis, showing that cortical markers of motor processes were affected by sentence meaning, therefore providing evidence for a semantics-to-motor effect. ERP results also demonstrated a motor-to-semantics effect as brain markers of comprehension were modified by motor effects.&lt;ref&gt;Aravena, P., Hurtado, E., Riveros, R., Cardona, J. F., Manes, F., &amp; Ibáñez, A. (2010). Applauding with closed hands: neural signature of action-sentence compatibility effects. PLoS One, 5(7), e11751.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Action-Compatibility Effect also states that the brain resources used to plan and carry out actions are also used in language comprehension; therefore, if an action implied in a sentence is different from the suggested response, there is interference within these brain resources.&lt;ref name = GlenbergK /&gt;

==Word Activation== 
Other studies have demonstrated that reading an object name interferes with how a person plans on grasping that object.&lt;ref name = Fischer&gt;Fischer, M., &amp; Zwann, R. (2008). Embodied language: A review of the role of the motor system in language comprehension. The Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology, 61(6), 825–50. doi:10.1080/17470210701623605&lt;/ref&gt;  It was also found that similar words can prime similar actions.  Playing the piano and using a typewriter both utilize similar motor actions; these words prime each other in a word decision task.&lt;ref name = Fischer /&gt;  These studies have concluded that activation of motor decisions occur automatically when exposed to action-related words.&lt;ref name = Fischer /&gt;

== Metaphorical Language ==
Aziz-Zadeh investigated congruent somatotopic organization of semantic representations for metaphorical sentences in either hemisphere. Aziz-Zadeh presented subjects with stimuli such as “kick the bucket” or “bite the bullet” to read and then followed by presenting subjects with videos of hand, foot, and mouth actions. Evidence could not be found in either hemisphere to support this theory.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The metaphors used in the experiment are common in the English language however. Therefore, the argument stands that if a metaphor is heard often enough it will not activate the same network of processing that it did initially.

==Actions emphasize meaning==
Many studies have shown how body movements and speech can be combined to emphasize meaning (often called [[gesturing]]).  A person can observe the actions of another to help them comprehend what that person is saying.&lt;ref name="Gibbs"&gt;Gibbs, R. W. (2006). Language and Communication. Embodiement and Cognitive Science, pp. 158–207.&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, if a person is pointing repeatedly, it helps the listener to understand that the direction being inferred is very important; whereas if it was a casual point in the general direction, the location of the object may not be as necessary to comprehend what the speaker is saying.  Another example may be the stomping of one’s foot.  This can help the listener to understand the anger and frustration being conveyed by the speaker.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

==Implications==
Many studies have demonstrated that people’s understanding of words and sentences can influence their movements and actions as well as the opposite – peoples’ actions can influence how quickly they can comprehend a word or sentence.&lt;ref name="Paradowski2014"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Paradowski MB |title=Storytelling in language teaching – re-evaluating the weight of kinaesthetic modality for brain-compatible pedagogy |journal=Storytelling: An Interdisciplinary Journal |volume=1 |issue=2 |pages=13–52 |year=2014 |url=https://www.academia.edu/10407960/Storytelling_in_language_teaching_re-evaluating_the_weight_of_kinaesthetic_modality_for_brain-compatible_pedagogy}}&lt;/ref&gt; This knowledge is important for many reasons. One study looked at the impact of embodied cognition in a classroom setting to facilitate and enhance language learning.  For a child, there is a difference between oral language learning and reading. In oral language learning, the mapping between a symbol (word) and the object is common – often brought about by gesturing to the object.&lt;ref name = GlenbergG&gt;Glenberg, A. M, and A. Goldberg. (2011). Improving early reading comprehension using embodied CAI. Instructional Science, 39 pp. 27–39. doi:10.1007/s11251-009-9096-7&lt;/ref&gt; However, when a child is learning to read, they focus on the letter-sound combinations and the correct pronunciation of the words.  Usually, the object the words are referring to, are not immediately connected with the word so an association between the word and object isn't immediately made.&lt;ref name = GlenbergG /&gt;  The researchers of this study suggest the ''Moved by Reading'' intervention which consists of two parts – Physical Manipulation stage and an Imagined Manipulation stage.&lt;ref name = GlenbergG /&gt;  In physical manipulation, the child reads a sentence and then is instructed to act out that sentence with available toys.&lt;ref name = GlenbergG /&gt;  This forces the child to connect words with objects and their actions. In the imagined manipulation stage, the child reads the sentence and is then asked to imagine how they would interact with toys to act out the sentence.&lt;ref name = GlenbergG /&gt;  They studied this further and discovered that it is possible for these children to still benefit from the effects of embodied cognition when they manipulate objects on a computer screen.&lt;ref name = GlenbergG /&gt;  This embodied cognition software can help children facilitate language comprehension.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}} Other implications for language instruction that would enhance acquisition and retention are to offer activities which invite learners to actively use their body in the process, or at least observe the teacher doing so, thus activating their mirror neurons.&lt;ref name="Paradowski2014"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5708">'''Erich Goode''' is an [[United States|American]] [[sociologist]] specializing in the [[sociology of deviance]]. He has written a number of books on the field in general, as well as on specific deviant topics.
He is a professor at the [[State University of New York at Stony Brook]].

==Biography==
Goode received a B.A. from [[Oberlin College]] (1960) and a Ph.D. in [[sociology]] from [[Columbia University]] (1966). He has taught at Columbia University, [[New York University]], [[Florida Atlantic University]], the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]], and [[Hebrew University]] in Jerusalem, Israel. He is currently employed as a professor at the [[State University of New York at Stony Brook]]. He also teaches at the University of Maryland.

Goode takes a [[Social constructionism|constructionist]] approach to deviance. In his view, a behavior is deviant if and only if society at large considers it so. The broader social factors that go into the classification of a behavior as deviant are thus considered a valid subject of study. His research focuses on the deviant individuals (and behaviors) themselves, as well as the particular individuals and groups that play a part in classifying the behavior as deviant. 

As a sociologist, Goode makes no judgment about whether a particular is "bad" or "evil", and considers deviance as a topic to be entirely dependent on whether the society at large considers the behavior deviant. In this view, a particular behavior can be deviant in one society, but normal in another. This is in contrast to the perspective of [[essentialism]], which would say that a behavior either "really is" deviant or "really isn't", and that it is the task of the sociologist to discover and report on the truth of the matter, and what society at large believes is mostly irrelevant.

According to the constructionist framework as espoused by Goode, an instance of "deviance" can exist as a social construct exclusively, completely separate from any actual behavior. In other words, "imaginary deviance" can exist that causes a frenzy of interesting sociological behavior in response to a non-existence phenomenon. [[Satanic ritual abuse]] is an example of this in modern times, and the case of [[witch hunts]] is an example from antiquity. These are often called [[moral panic]]s, and Goode considers them a valid subject (perhaps the ideal subject) for deviance studies.

Erich Goode is known for his exploration and exposure of the "[[moral panic]]" concept. He takes a "harm reductionist" approach to studying social deviance. This commitment aims to reduce social harm without engaging in value judgments or essentialist claims about those being studied.

==Goode's Four Types of Drug Use==
1. Legal instrumental use - Taking prescribed drugs and over the counter drugs to relieve or treat symptoms. 

2. Legal recreational use - Using legal (tobacco, alcohol, caffeine) drugs to achieve a certain mental state. 

3. Illegal instrumental use - Taking non prescription drugs to accomplish a task or goal. 

4.Illegal recreational use - Taking illegal drugs for fun or pleasure to experience euphoria.&lt;ref&gt;Hanson, Glen R., Peter J. Venturelli, and Annette E. Fleckenstein. Drugs and Society. 9th ed. Sudbury: Jones and Bartlett, 2006. 19. 
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Books==

In ''[http://www.druglibrary.org/special/goode/mjsmokers.htm The Marijuana Smokers]'' (1971), Goode looked at marijuana through a sociological lens.

In ''Drugs in American Society'', Goode argued that the effect of a drug is dependent on the societal context in which it is taken. Thus, in one society (or social context) a particular drug may be a depressant, and in another it may be a stimulant.

''Deviant Behavior'' is a textbook intended for undergrad students. In it, Goode takes the position of a weak constructionist.

''Moral Panics: The Social Construction of Deviance'', written with [[Nachman Ben-Yehuda]], is a book about moral panics, from a sociological perspective. 

In ''Paranormal Beliefs: A Sociological Introduction'' (1999), Goode studies paranormal beliefs such as [[UFOs]], [[Extrasensory perception|ESP]], and [[creationism]] using the methods of the sociology of deviance. Consistent in tone with the rest of his works, he takes the position that whether the phenomenon in question is real is not important to a sociologist. Rather, sociologists should be concerned with how the paranormalist is labeled as deviant, and what effect the label has on them and society.

==Controversy==

As a sociologist, Goode relies heavily on informants for his research. For example, Goode consulted with and interviewed actual drug users for his books on drugs. In 1999, Goode admitted through the sociology journal circuit that he had engaged in sexual intercourse with many of his deviant informants, and discussed how this influenced his perspective on the subject he was studying. This caused a firestorm of articles defending or denouncing his work.&lt;ref name=sex_with_informants&gt;{{cite journal|last=Goode|first=Erich|title=sex with informants as deviant behavior: an account and commentary|journal=Deviant Behavior|date=October 1999|volume=20|issue=4|pages=301–324 http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/routledg/udbh/1999/00000020/00000004/art00001]|doi=10.1080/016396299266416}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gayane Khachaturian''' ({{lang-hy|Գայանե Խաչատրյան}}) (May 9, 1942 – May 1, 2009) was a [[Georgian people|Georgian]]-[[Armenian people|Armenian]] painter and graphic artist.

==Biography==

Gayane Khachaturian was born into an Armenian family in [[Tbilisi]], capital of Georgia, and studied art at the Nikoladze Art School. She became seriously involved in the art scene after graduating from the Secondary School of Working Youth in 1960. She met [[Sergei Parajanov]] in 1967 at [[Elene Akhvlediani]]'s house and they maintained a close friendship which lasted until his death. Some of Khachaturian’s works are permanently exhibited at the [[Yerevan]] Museum of Modern Art, the [[National Gallery of Armenia]], [[Sergei Parajanov Museum]] in Yerevan as well as are in a number of private collections, including those owned by Valerie Khanukaev, Bagrat Nikogosyan, and Artashes Aleksanyan. When she was alive, her tiny studio on Bakinskaya Street had become a tourist attraction. According to Russian art critic Vitaly Patsyukov, "Khachaturian is among those pioneers of new artistic consciousness who draw into their focus all phenomenal aspects of European 'actual view' and the radical sensuousness and natural freedom of plastic gesture." &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accea.info/images/pdf/09_05N2_Gayane_Catalog_on_A4.pdf Gayane Khachaturian's Catalog, Armenian Pavilion, 53rd International Art Exhibition la Biennale di Venezia]&lt;/ref&gt;

Khachaturian died on May 1, 2009 and is buried in the [[Armenian Pantheon of Tbilisi]] ([[Khojivank]]).

'''Hydropower''' or '''water power''' (from  {{lang-el|ύδωρ}}, "water") is [[power (physics)|power]] derived from the [[energy]] of falling water or fast running water, which may be harnessed for useful purposes. Since ancient times, hydropower from many kinds of [[watermill]]s has been used as a [[renewable energy]] source for [[irrigation]] and the operation of various mechanical devices, such as [[gristmill]]s, [[sawmill]]s, [[textile]] mills, [[trip hammer]]s, dock [[crane (machine)|cranes]], domestic [[elevator|lifts]], and [[ore]] mills. A [[trompe]], which produces compressed air from falling water, is sometimes used to power other machinery at a distance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://energy.gov/eere/water/history-hydropower|title=History of Hydropower {{!}} Department of Energy|website=energy.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.niagarafrontier.com/power.html|title=Niagara Falls History of Power|website=www.niagarafrontier.com|access-date=2017-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 19th century, hydropower became a source for generating [[electricity]]. [[Cragside]] in Northumberland was the first house powered by hydroelectricity in 1878&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/cragside/|title=Cragside Visitor Information|publisher=The National Trust|accessdate=16 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the first commercial hydroelectric power plant was built at [[Niagara Falls]] in 1879. In 1881, street lamps in the city of Niagara Falls were powered by hydropower.

Since the early 20th century, the term has been used almost exclusively in conjunction with the modern development of [[hydroelectricity|hydroelectric power]].  International institutions such as the [[World Bank]] view hydropower as a means for [[economic development]] without adding substantial amounts of carbon to the atmosphere,&lt;ref name=WP5813&gt;{{cite news|title=World Bank turns to hydropower to square development with climate change|url=https://articles.washingtonpost.com/2013-05-08/business/39105348_1_jim-yong-kim-world-bank-hydropower|accessdate=9 May 2013|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=8 May 2013|author=Howard Schneider}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

[[File: WATER-POWERED ORE MILL, TAKEN FROM SOUTH - Liberty Historic District, Water Powered Ore Mill, Route 2, Cle Elum, Liberty, Kittitas County, WA HABS WASH,19-LIB,1W-1.tif|thumb|Directly water-powered ore mill, late nineteenth century]]

In [[History of India|India]], [[water wheel]]s and [[watermill]]s were built, possibly as early as the 4th century BC, although records of that era are spotty at best.&lt;ref&gt;Terry S. Reynolds, ''Stronger than a Hundred Men: A History of the Vertical Water Wheel'', JHU Press, 2002 {{ISBN|0801872480}}, page 14&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Roman Empire]], water-powered mills produced flour from grain, and were also used for sawing timber and stone; in China, watermills were widely used since the [[Han dynasty]].  In [[China]] and the rest of the Far East, hydraulically operated "pot wheel" pumps raised water into crop or irrigation canals.{{when|date=August 2015}}

The power of a wave of water released from a tank was used for extraction of metal ores in a method known as [[hushing]]. The method was first used at the [[Dolaucothi Gold Mines]] in [[Wales]] from 75 AD onwards, but had been developed in [[Spain]] at such mines as [[Las Médulas]]. Hushing was also widely used in [[Great Britain|Britain]] in the [[Middle Ages|Medieval]] and later periods to extract [[lead]] and [[tin]] ores.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hunt|first1=Robert|title=British Mining: A Treatise in the History, Discovery, Practical Development, and Future Prospects of Metalliferous Mines of the United Kingdom|date=1887|publisher=Crosby Lockwood and Co|location=London|page=505|edition=2nd|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MQU55QQHRGcC&amp;pg=PA505&amp;lpg=PA505#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=2 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It later evolved into [[hydraulic mining]] when used during the [[California Gold Rush]].

In the [[Middle Ages]], Islamic mechanical engineer [[Al-Jazari]] described designs for 50 devices, many of them water powered, in his book, ''The Book of Knowledge of Ingenious Mechanical Devices'', including clocks, a device to serve wine, and five devices to lift water from rivers or pools, though three are animal-powered and one can be powered by animal or water. These include [[Scoop wheel|an endless belt with jugs attached]], a cow-powered [[shadoof]], and a reciprocating device with hinged valves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Al-Hassani|first1=Salim|title=800 Years Later: In Memory of Al-Jazari, A Genius Mechanical Engineer|url=http://muslimheritage.com/article/800-years-later-memory-al-jazari-genius-mechanical-engineer|website=Muslim Heritage|publisher=The Foundation for Science, Technology, and Civilisation|accessdate=30 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better ref needed|date=November 2015}}

In 1753, French engineer [[Bernard Forest de Bélidor]] published ''Architecture Hydraulique'' which described vertical- and horizontal-axis hydraulic machines. By the late nineteenth century, the [[electric generator]] was developed by a team led by [[project managers]] and prominent pioneers of renewable energy [[Jacob S. Gibbs]] and [[Brinsley Coleberd]] and could now be coupled with hydraulics.&lt;ref name="doehis"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www1.eere.energy.gov/windandhydro/hydro_history.html |title=History of Hydropower |publisher=US Department of Energy |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100126001540/http://www1.eere.energy.gov/windandhydro/hydro_history.html |archivedate=26 January 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The growing demand for the [[Industrial Revolution]] would drive development as well.&lt;ref name="watenc"&gt;{{cite web|title=Hydroelectric Power|url=http://www.waterencyclopedia.com/Ge-Hy/Hydroelectric-Power.html|publisher=Water Encyclopedia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the beginning of the Industrial Revolution in Britain, water was the main source of power for new inventions such as [[Richard Arkwright]]'s [[water frame]].&lt;ref name="kreis"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.historyguide.org/intellect/lecture17a.html|title=The Origins of the Industrial Revolution in England|last=Kreis|first=Steven|year=2001|work=The history guide|accessdate=19 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the use of water power gave way to steam power in many of the larger mills and factories, it was still used during the 18th and 19th centuries for many smaller operations, such as driving the bellows in small [[blast furnace]]s (e.g. the [[Dyfi Furnace]])&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/mid/sites/history/pages/dyfifurnace.shtml|title=Dyfi Furnace|last=Gwynn|first=Osian|work=BBC Mid Wales History|publisher=BBC|accessdate=19 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[gristmill]]s, such as those built at [[Saint Anthony Falls]], which uses the 50-foot (15&amp;nbsp;m) drop in the [[Mississippi River]].

In the 1830s, at the early peak in the US [[canal]]-building, hydropower provided the energy to transport [[barge]] traffic up and down steep hills using [[Cable railway|inclined plane railroads]].  As railroads overtook canals for transportation, canal systems were modified and developed into hydropower systems; the [[history of Lowell, Massachusetts]] is a classic example of commercial development and industrialization, built upon the availability of water power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://library.uml.edu/clh/Malone/notes_01.pdf|title=Waterpower in Lowell|publisher=University of Massachusetts|accessdate=28 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Technological advances had moved the open water wheel into an enclosed [[turbine]] or [[Water engine|water motor]]. In 1848 [[James B. Francis]], while working as head engineer of Lowell's Locks and Canals company, improved on these designs to create a turbine with 90% efficiency.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} He applied scientific principles and testing methods to the problem of turbine design. His mathematical and graphical calculation methods allowed the confident design of high-efficiency turbines to exactly match a site's specific flow conditions.  The [[Francis turbine|Francis reaction turbine]] is still in wide use today. In the 1870s, deriving from uses in the California mining industry, [[Lester Allan Pelton]] developed the high efficiency [[Pelton wheel|Pelton wheel impulse turbine]], which utilized hydropower from the high head streams characteristic of the mountainous California interior.

=== Hydraulic power-pipe networks ===
[[Hydraulic power network]]s used pipes to carry pressurized water and transmit mechanical power from the source to end users. The power source was normally a head of water, which could also be assisted by a pump. These were extensive in [[Victorian era|Victorian]] cities in the United Kingdom. A hydraulic power network was also developed in [[Geneva]], Switzerland. The world-famous [[Jet d'Eau]] was originally designed as the over-pressure relief valve for the network.&lt;ref name=geneva&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geneve-tourisme.ch/?rubrique=0000000172|title=Things to do in Geneva, Switzerland - Geneva Tourism Official Website|website=www.geneve-tourisme.ch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Compressed air hydro ===
{{See also|Trompe}}
Where there is a plentiful head of water it can be made to generate [[compressed air]] directly without moving parts. In these designs, a falling column of water is purposely mixed with air bubbles generated through turbulence or a venturi pressure reducer at the high-level intake. This is allowed to fall down a shaft into a subterranean, high-roofed chamber where the now-compressed air separates from the water and becomes trapped. The height of the falling water column maintains compression of the air in the top of the chamber, while an outlet, submerged below the water level in the chamber allows water to flow back to the surface at a lower level than the intake. A separate outlet in the roof of the chamber supplies the compressed air. A facility on this principle was built on the [[Montreal River (Timiskaming District)|Montreal River]] at Ragged Shutes near [[Cobalt, Ontario]] in 1910 and supplied 5,000 horsepower to nearby mines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Maynard|first=Frank|date=November 1910|title=Five thousand horsepower from air bubbles|journal=Popular Mechanics|pages=633|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-N0DAAAAMBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Hydropower types ==
{{Main article|Hydroelectricity}}
Hydropower is used primarily to generate [[electricity]]. Broad categories include:
* [[Hydroelectricity#Generating methods|Conventional hydroelectric]], referring to hydroelectric dams.
* [[Run-of-the-river hydroelectricity]], which captures the kinetic energy in rivers or streams, without a large reservoir and sometimes without the use of dams.
* [[Small hydro]] projects are 10 megawatts or less and often have no artificial reservoirs.
* [[Micro hydro]] projects provide a few kilowatts to a few hundred kilowatts to isolated homes, villages, or small industries.
* [[Conduit hydroelectricity]] projects utilize water which has already been diverted for use elsewhere; in a municipal water system, for example.
* [[Pumped-storage hydroelectricity]] stores water pumped uphill into reservoirs during periods of low demand to be released for generation when demand is high or system generation is low.
* [[Tidal stream generator|Off-shore Hydropower]] using energy from [[tidal power]] generated from oceans, rivers, and human-made canal systems to generating electricity&lt;ref&gt;http://www.british-hydro.org/tidal-range-off-shore/&lt;/ref&gt;.
* [[Pressure buffering hydropower]] use natural sources (waves for example) for water pumping to turbines while exceeding water is pumped uphill into reservoirs and releases when incoming water flow isn't enough.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

== Calculating the amount of available power ==
A hydropower resource can be evaluated by its available [[Power (physics)|power]]. Power is a function of the [[hydraulic head]] and [[rate of fluid flow]]. The head is the energy per unit weight (or unit mass) of water. The static head is proportional to the difference in height through which the water falls. Dynamic head is related to the velocity of moving water. Each unit of water can do an amount of work equal to its weight times the head.

The power available from falling water can be calculated from the flow rate and density of water, the height of fall, and the local acceleration due to gravity.
In SI units, the power is:

&lt;math&gt;P=\eta\rho\,Qgh\!&lt;/math&gt;

where
* P is power in watts
* η is the dimensionless efficiency of the turbine
* ρ is the density of water in kilograms per cubic metre
* Q is the flow in cubic metres per second
* g is the acceleration due to gravity
* h is the height difference between inlet and outlet in metres

To illustrate, power is calculated for a turbine that is 85% efficient, with water at 1000&amp;nbsp;kg/cubic metre (62.5 pounds/cubic foot) and a flow rate of 80 cubic-meters/second (2800 cubic-feet/second), gravity of 9.81 metres per second squared and with a net head of 145&amp;nbsp;m (480&amp;nbsp;ft).

In SI units:
:&lt;math&gt;\text{Power (W)}  = 0.85\times 1000 \times 80 \times 9.81 \times 145 &lt;/math&gt; which gives 97 MW

In English units, the density is given in pounds per cubic foot so acceleration due to gravity is inherent in the unit of weight. A conversion factor is required to change from foot lbs/second to kilowatts:
:&lt;math&gt;\text{Power (W)} = 0.85\times 62.5 \times 2800 \times 480 \times 1.356 &lt;/math&gt; which gives 97 MW (130,000 [[horsepower]])

Operators of hydroelectric stations will compare the total electrical energy produced with the theoretical potential energy of the water passing through the turbine to calculate efficiency. Procedures and definitions for calculation of efficiency are given in test codes such as [[ASME]] PTC 18 and [[International Electrotechnical Commission|IEC]] 60041. Field testing of turbines is used to validate the manufacturer's guaranteed efficiency. Detailed calculation of the efficiency of a hydropower turbine will account for the head lost due to flow friction in the power canal or penstock, rise in tail water level due to flow, the location of the station and effect of varying gravity, the temperature and barometric pressure of the air, the density of the water at ambient temperature, and the altitudes above sea level of the forebay and tailbay. For precise calculations, errors due to rounding and the number of [[significant digit]]s of constants must be considered.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

Some hydropower systems such as [[water wheel]]s can draw power from the flow of a body of water without necessarily changing its height. In this case, the available power is the [[kinetic energy]] of the flowing water. Over-shot water wheels can efficiently capture both types of energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=S. K.|first1=Sahdev|title=Basic Electrical Engineering|publisher=Pearson Education India|isbn=9789332576797|page=418|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The water flow in a stream can vary widely from season to season. Development of a hydropower site requires analysis of [[streamflow|flow records]], sometimes spanning decades, to assess the reliable annual energy supply. Dams and reservoirs provide a more dependable source of power by smoothing seasonal changes in water flow. However reservoirs have significant [[Environmental impact of reservoirs|environmental impact]], as does alteration of naturally occurring stream flow. The design of dams must also account for the worst-case, "probable maximum flood" that can be expected at the site; a [[spillway]] is often included to bypass flood flows around the dam. A computer [[Hydrological modelling|model of the hydraulic basin]] and rainfall and snowfall records are used to predict the maximum flood.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

== Sustainability ==
{{see also|Environmental impact of reservoirs}}
As with other forms of economic activity, hydropower projects can have both a positive and a negative environmental and social impact, because the construction of a dam and power plant, along with the impounding of a reservoir, creates certain social and physical changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Allure and Perils of Hydropower |url = https://undark.org/article/hydropower-dams-albania-vjosa/|website = www.undark.org|accessdate = 2017-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;These environmental and social impact are not limited to but include the removal of communities near the dam, as well as the hindrance of fish migration. Since water is being taken away, this also affects local communities access and amount of drinking water.&lt;ref&gt;https://scholarworks.uvm.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1013&amp;context=envstheses&lt;/ref&gt; There is also evidence that dams affect the soil, which then alters the ability of vegetation to grow.&lt;ref&gt;https://search-proquest-com.offcampus.lib.washington.edu/earthatmosphericaquatic/docview/761185281/fulltext/A0F81B52C7504484PQ/13?accountid=14784&lt;/ref&gt;
Hydropower projects can also have indirect consequences, contributing to [[global warming]]: reservoirs accumulate plant material, which then decomposes, emitting [[methane]] in uneven bursts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2016/09/hundreds-new-dams-could-mean-trouble-our-climate |title=Hundreds of new dams could mean trouble for our climate|work=Science |date=September 28, 2016|accessdate= 2016-10-11 |doi=10.1126/science.aah7356|publisher=AAAS}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://academic.oup.com/bioscience/article/50/9/766/269391|title=Reservoir Surfaces as Sources of Greenhouse Gases to the Atmosphere: A Global Estimate: Reservoirs are sources of greenhouse gases to the atmosphere, and their surface areas have increased to the point where they should be included in global inventories of anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases|first1=St|last1=Louis|first2=Vincent|last2=L|first3=Carol A.|last3=Kelly|first4=Éric|last4=Duchemin|first5=John W.

There are several tools to assess the impact of hydropower projects:

*Most new hydropower project must undergo an [[Environmental impact assessment|Environmental and Social Impact Assessment]]. This provides a base-line understanding of the pre-project conditions, estimates of potential impacts and puts in place management plans to avoid, mitigate, or compensate for impacts.

*The [[Hydropower Sustainability Assessment Protocol]] is another tool which can be used to promote and guide more sustainable hydropower projects. It is a methodology used to audit the performance of a hydropower project across more than twenty environmental, social, technical and economic topics. A Protocol assessment provides a rapid sustainability health check. It does not replace an environmental and social impact assessment (ESIA), which takes place over a much longer period of time, usually as a mandatory regulatory requirement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Hydropower Sustainability - Home|url = http://www.hydrosustainability.org/|website = www.hydrosustainability.org|accessdate = 2015-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hyperthecosis''' (or ovarian hyperthecosis) is [[hyperplasia]] of the [[theca interna]] of the [[ovary]].&lt;ref&gt;Taber's Cyclopedic Medical Dictionary 21st Edition&lt;/ref&gt; Hyperthecosis occurs when an area of luteinization occurs along with stromal hyperplasia. The luteinized cells produce [[androgens]], which may lead to [[hirsutism]] and [[virilization]] (or masculinization) in affected women.&lt;ref&gt;Stead, Stead, Kaufman, Suarez (2009). First Aid for the Obstretrics &amp; Gynecology Clerkship - Second Edition. McGraw-Hill&lt;/ref&gt;

The term hyperthecosis refers to the presence of nests of luteinized theca cells in the ovarian stroma due to differentiation of the ovarian interstitial cells into steroidogenically active luteinized stromal cells. These nests or islands of luteinized theca cells are scattered throughout the stroma of the ovary, rather than being confined to areas around cystic follicles as in [[Polycystic ovary syndrome|polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)]]. These luteinized theca cells result in greater production of androgens.

Seen as a severe form of PCOS, the clinical features of hyperthecosis are similar to those of PCOS.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zhang|first=Cunxian|last2=Sung|first2=C. James|last3=Quddus|first3=M.

== Cause ==
The etiology of hyperthecosis is unknown, however evidence suggests a possibility of genetic transmission. Hyperthecosis has been documented in familiar patterns.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/21998336_Hyperthecosis_an_inheritable_form_of_polycystic_ovarian_disease|title=Hyperthecosis: an inheritable form of polycystic ovarian disease|last=Wilroy|first=R.S.|date=February 1975|website=ResearchGate|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Insulin resistance]] may also play a role in the pathogenesis of hyperthecosis. Women with hyperthecosis have a significant degree of insulin resistance and insulin may stimulate the ovarian stromal androgen synthesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0002937886906769|title=Hyperinsulinemia in hyperthecosis of the ovaries |last=Nagamani M.D.|first=Manubai|date=February 1986|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-05-03|doi=10.1016/0002-9378(86)90676-9|volume=154|journal=American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology|pages=384–389}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Prognosis ==
Although no large studies showing the long term outcomes for women with hyperthecosis exist, a diagnosis of hyperthecosis may suggest an increased risk for metabolic complications of [[hyperlipidemia]] and [[type 2 diabetes]] .&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rothman|first=Micol S.|last2=Wierman|first2=Margaret E.|date=2011-08-01|title=How should postmenopausal androgen excess be evaluated?|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2265.2011.04040.x/abstract|journal=Clinical Endocrinology|language=en|volume=75|issue=2|pages=160–164|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2265.2011.04040.x|issn=1365-2265}}&lt;/ref&gt; In postmenopausal women, hyperthecosis may also contribute to the pathogenesis of endometrial polyp, endometrial hyperplasia, and endometrioid adenocarcinoma due to the association of hyperestrinism (excess estrins in the body) and hyperthecosis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zhang|first=Cunxian|last2=Sung|first2=C.

An '''information society''' is a [[society]] where the creation, distribution, use, integration and manipulation of [[information]] is a significant economic, political, and cultural activity. Its main drivers are digital [[information and communication technologies]], which have resulted in an [[information explosion]] and are profoundly changing all aspects of social organization, including the [[economy]],&lt;ref&gt;Hilbert, M. (2015).

(2015). Digital Technology and Social Change [Open Online Course at the University of California] freely available at: https://canvas.instructure.com/courses/949415&lt;/ref&gt; The people who have the means to partake in this form of society are sometimes called [[digital citizen]]s, defined by K. Mossberger as “Those who use the Internet regularly and effectively”. This is one of many dozen labels that have been identified to suggest that humans are entering a new phase of society.&lt;ref name="Beniger 1986"&gt;{{cite book |title= The Control Revolution: Technological and Economic Origins of the Information Society |last= Beniger |first=James R. |authorlink= James R. Beniger |date=1986 |location=Cambridge, Mass. |publisher=Harvard University Press|title-link= The Control Revolution }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The markers of this rapid change may be technological, economic, occupational, spatial, cultural, or some combination of all of these.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book |last=Webster |first=Frank |title=Theories of the Information Society |date=2002 |publisher=Routledge |location=Cambridge}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Information society is seen as the successor to [[industrial society]]. Closely related concepts are the [[post-industrial society]] ([[Daniel Bell]]), [[post-fordism]], [[postmodernity|post-modern]] society, knowledge society, telematic society, [[Information Revolution]], [[liquid modernity]], and [[network society]] ([[Manuel Castells]]).

==Definition==
There is currently no universally accepted concept of what exactly can be termed information society and what shall rather not so be termed. Most theoreticians agree that a transformation can be seen that started somewhere between the 1970s and today and is changing the way societies work fundamentally. Information technology goes beyond the [[internet]], and there are discussions about how big the influence of specific media or specific modes of production really is. Frank Webster notes five major types of information that can be used to define information society: technological, economic, occupational, spatial and cultural.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; According to Webster, the character of information has transformed the way that we live today. How we conduct ourselves centers around theoretical knowledge and information.&lt;ref&gt;Webster, F. (2006). Chapter 2: What is an information society? In ''Theories of the Information Society'', 3rd ed. (pp. 15-31). New York: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kasiwulaya and Gomo (Makerere University) allude{{Where|date=February 2018}}&lt;!-- Exactly where do they make this allusion (if allusions are even worth bothering with)? --&gt;{{Dubious|date=February 2018}}&lt;!-- If they don't dare say it but merely allude to it, why are we bothering with this? --&gt; that information societies are those that have intensified their use of IT for economic, social, cultural and political transformation. In 2005, governments reaffirmed their dedication to the foundations of the Information
Society in the [[Tunis Commitment]] and outlined the basis for implementation and follow-up in the Tunis Agenda for the Information Society. In particular, the Tunis Agenda addresses the issues of financing of ICTs for development and Internet governance that could not be resolved in the first phase.

Some people, such as [[Antonio Negri]], characterize the information society as one in which people do immaterial labour. By this, they appear to refer to the production of knowledge or cultural artifacts. One problem with this model is that it ignores the material and essentially industrial basis of the society. However it does point to a problem for workers, namely how many creative people does this society need to function?  For example, it may be that you only need a few star performers, rather than a plethora of non-celebrities, as the work of those performers can be easily distributed, forcing all secondary players to the bottom of the market. It ''is'' now common for publishers to promote only their best selling authors and to try to avoid the rest—even if they still sell steadily. Films are becoming more and more judged, in terms of distribution, by their first weekend's performance, in many cases cutting out opportunity for word-of-mouth development.

[[Michael Buckland]] characterizes information in society in his book ''Information and Society.'' Buckland expresses the idea that information can be interpreted differently from person to person based on that individual's experiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Buckland|first1=Michael|title=Information in Society|date=March 3, 2017|publisher=MIT Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Considering that metaphors and technologies of information move forward in a reciprocal relationship, we can describe some societies (especially the [[Japanese society]]) as an information society because we think of it as such.&lt;ref&gt;[[James Boyle (academic)|James Boyle]], 1996, 6{{Vague|date=February 2018}}&lt;!-- WHAT, published by Boyle in 1996? --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;Kasiwulaya and Walter, Makerere University. Makerere University Press.{{Vague|date=February 2018}}&lt;!-- WHAT is this? --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The word information may be interpreted in many different ways. According to Buckland in ''Information and Society'', most of the meanings fall into three categories of human knowledge: information as knowledge, information as a process, and information as a thing.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Information and Society|last=Buckland|first=Michael|publisher=MIT Press|year=2017|isbn=|location=Cambridge, MA|pages=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The growth of technologically mediated information has been quantified in different ways, including society's technological capacity to store information, to communicate information, and to compute information. It is estimated that, the world's technological capacity to store information grew from 2.6 (optimally compressed) [[exabytes]] in 1986, which is the informational equivalent to less than one 730-MB [[CD-ROM]] per person in 1986 (539 MB per person), to 295 (optimally compressed) [[exabytes]] in 2007.&lt;ref name="HilbertLopez2011"&gt;[http://www.sciencemag.org/content/332/6025/60 "The World’s Technological Capacity to Store, Communicate, and Compute Information"], Martin Hilbert and Priscila López (2011), [[Science (journal)|Science]], 332(6025), 60-65; free access to the article through here: martinhilbert.net/WorldInfoCapacity.html&lt;/ref&gt; This is the informational equivalent of 60 [[CD-ROM]] per person in 2007&lt;ref name="Hilbertvideo2011"&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIKPjOuwqHo "video animation on The World’s Technological Capacity to Store, Communicate, and Compute Information from 1986 to 2010]&lt;/ref&gt; and represents a sustained annual growth rate of some 25%. The world’s combined technological capacity to receive information through one-way [[broadcast]] networks was the informational equivalent of 174 newspapers per person per day in 2007.&lt;ref name="HilbertLopez2011"/&gt;

The world's combined effective capacity to exchange information through two-way [[telecommunication]] networks was 281 [[petabytes]] of (optimally compressed) information in 1986, 471 [[petabytes]] in 1993, 2.2 (optimally compressed) [[exabytes]] in 2000, and 65 (optimally compressed) [[exabytes]] in 2007, which is the informational equivalent of 6 newspapers per person per day in 2007.&lt;ref name="Hilbertvideo2011"/&gt; The world's technological capacity to compute information with humanly guided general-purpose computers grew from 3.0 × 10^8 MIPS in 1986, to 6.4 x 10^12 MIPS in 2007, experiencing the fastest growth rate of over 60% per year during the last two decades.&lt;ref name="HilbertLopez2011"/&gt;

[[James R. Beniger]] describes the necessity of information in modern society in the following way: “The need for sharply increased control that resulted from the industrialization of material processes through application of inanimate sources of energy probably accounts for the rapid development of automatic feedback technology in the early industrial period (1740-1830)” (p.&amp;nbsp;174)
“Even with enhanced feedback control, industry could not have developed without the enhanced means to process matter and energy, not only as inputs of the raw materials of production but also as outputs distributed to final consumption.”(p.&amp;nbsp;175)&lt;ref name="Beniger 1986"/&gt;

==Development of the information society model==
[[File:Clark's Sector Model.png|right|thumb|450px|Colin Clark (economist)|[[Colin Clark (economist)|Colin Clark]]'s sector model of an economy undergoing technological change. In later stages, the [[Quaternary sector of the economy]] grows.]]
One of the first people to develop the concept of the information society was the economist [[Fritz Machlup]]. In 1933, Fritz Machlup began studying the effect of patents on research. His work culminated in the study ''The production and distribution of knowledge in the United States'' in 1962. This book was widely regarded&lt;ref&gt;Susan Crawford: "[http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pmcentrez&amp;artid=227258 The Origin and Development of a Concept: The Information Society]". ''Bull Med Libr Assoc.'' 71(4) October 1983: 380–385.&lt;/ref&gt; and was eventually translated into [[Russian language|Russian]] and [[Japanese language|Japanese]]. The Japanese have also studied the information society (or ''jōhōka shakai'', [[:ja:情報化社会|情報化社会]]).

The issue of technologies and their role in contemporary society have been discussed in the scientific literature using a range of labels and concepts. This section introduces some of them. Ideas of a knowledge or [[information economy]], [[post-industrial society]], [[postmodernism|postmodern]] society, [[network society]], the [[information revolution]], informational capitalism, network capitalism, and the like, have been debated over the last several decades.

Fritz Machlup (1962) introduced the concept of the [[knowledge economy|knowledge industry]]. He began studying the effects of patents on research before distinguishing five sectors of the knowledge sector: education, research and development, mass media, information technologies, information services. Based on this categorization he calculated that in 1959 29% per cent of the GNP in the USA had been produced in knowledge industries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Proceedings of the 11th International Conference on Intellectual Capital, Knowledge Management and Organizational Learning|last=Rooney|first=Jim|publisher=Academic Conferences and Publishing International Limited|year=2014|isbn=978-1-910309-71-1|location=UK|pages=261}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Machlup|first1=Fritz|title=The Production and Distribution of Knowledge in the United States|date=1962|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, NJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|reason=What's the year referring to?|date=November 2009}}

=== Economic transition ===
[[Peter Drucker]] has argued that there is a transition from an economy based on material goods to one based on knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter Drucker]] (1969) ''The Age of Discontinuity''. London: Heinemann&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marc Porat]] distinguishes a primary (information goods and services that are directly used in the production, distribution or processing of information) and a secondary sector (information services produced for internal consumption by government and non-information firms) of the information economy.&lt;ref&gt;[[Marc Porat]] (1977) The Information Economy. Washington, DC: US Department of Commerce&lt;/ref&gt;

Porat uses the total value added by the primary and secondary information sector to the GNP as an indicator for the information economy. The [[OECD]] has employed Porat's definition for calculating the share of the information economy in the total economy (e.g. OECD 1981, 1986). Based on such indicators, the information society has been defined as a society where more than half of the GNP is produced and more than half of the employees are active in the information economy.&lt;ref name=deutsch1983&gt;Karl Deutsch (1983) Soziale und politische Aspekte der Informationsgesellschaft. In: Philipp Sonntag (Ed.) (1983) Die Zukunft der Informationsgesellschaft. Frankfurt/Main: Haag &amp; Herchen. pp. 68-88&lt;/ref&gt;

For [[Daniel Bell]] the number of employees producing services and information is an indicator for the informational character of a society. "A post-industrial society is based on services. (…) What counts is not raw muscle power, or energy, but information. (…) A post industrial society is one in which the majority of those employed are not involved in the production of tangible goods".&lt;ref&gt;[[Daniel Bell]] (1976) The Coming of Post-Industrial Society. New York: Basic Books, 127, 348&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alain Touraine]] already spoke in 1971 of the post-industrial society. "The passage to postindustrial society takes place when investment results in the production of symbolic goods that modify values, needs, representations, far more than in the production of material goods or even of 'services'. Industrial society had transformed the means of production: post-industrial society changes the ends of production, that is, culture. (…) The decisive point here is that in postindustrial society all of the economic system is the object of intervention of society upon itself. That is why we can call it the programmed society, because this phrase captures its capacity to create models of management, production, organization, distribution, and consumption, so that such a society appears, at all its functional levels, as the product of an action exercised by the society itself, and not as the outcome of natural laws or cultural specificities" (Touraine 1988: 104). In the programmed society also the area of cultural reproduction including aspects such as information, consumption, health, research, education would be industrialized. That modern society is increasing its capacity to act upon itself means for Touraine that society is reinvesting ever larger parts of production and so produces and transforms itself. This makes Touraine's concept substantially different from that of Daniel Bell who focused on the capacity to process and generate information for efficient society functioning.

[[Jean-François Lyotard]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Jean-François Lyotard]] (1984) ''The Postmodern Condition''. Manchester: Manchester University Press, 5&lt;/ref&gt; has argued that "knowledge has become the {{sic|principle}} force of production over the last few decades". Knowledge would be transformed into a commodity. Lyotard says that postindustrial society makes knowledge accessible to the layman because knowledge and information technologies would diffuse into society and break up Grand Narratives of centralized structures and groups. Lyotard denotes these changing circumstances as postmodern condition or postmodern society.

Similarly to Bell, Peter Otto and Philipp Sonntag (1985) say that an information society is a society where the majority of employees work in information jobs, i.e. they have to deal more with information, signals, symbols, and images than with energy and matter. [[Radovan Richta]] (1977) argues that society has been transformed into a scientific civilization based on services, education, and creative activities. This transformation would be the result of a scientific-technological transformation based on technological progress and the increasing importance of computer technology. Science and technology would become immediate forces of production (Aristovnik 2014: 55).

[[Nico Stehr]] (1994, 2002a, b) says that in the knowledge society a majority of jobs involves working with knowledge. "Contemporary society may be described as a knowledge society based on the extensive penetration of all its spheres of life and institutions by scientific and technological knowledge" (Stehr 2002b: 18). For Stehr, knowledge is a capacity for social action. Science would become an immediate productive force, knowledge would no longer be primarily embodied in machines, but already appropriated nature that represents knowledge would be rearranged according to certain designs and programs (Ibid.: 41-46). For Stehr, the economy of a knowledge society is largely driven not by material inputs, but by symbolic or knowledge-based inputs (Ibid.: 67), there would be a large number of professions that involve working with knowledge, and a declining number of jobs that demand low cognitive skills as well as in manufacturing (Stehr 2002a).

Also [[Alvin Toffler]] argues that knowledge is the central resource in the economy of the information society: "In a Third Wave economy, the central resource – a single word broadly encompassing data, information, images, symbols, culture, ideology, and values –  is actionable knowledge" (Dyson/Gilder/Keyworth/Toffler 1994).

At the end of the twentieth century, the concept of the [[network society]] gained importance in information society theory. For [[Manuel Castells]], network logic is besides information, pervasiveness, flexibility, and convergence a central feature of the information technology paradigm (2000a: 69ff). "One of the key features of informational society is the networking logic of its basic structure, which explains the use of the concept of 'network society'" (Castells 2000: 21). "As an historical trend, dominant functions and processes in the Information Age are increasingly organized around networks. Networks constitute the new social morphology of our societies, and the diffusion of networking logic substantially modifies the operation and outcomes in processes of production, experience, power, and culture" (Castells 2000: 500). For Castells the network society is the result of informationalism, a new technological paradigm.

[[Jan Van Dijk]] (2006) defines the network society as a "social formation with an infrastructure of social and media networks enabling its prime mode of organization at all levels (individual, group/organizational and societal). Increasingly, these networks link all units or parts of this formation (individuals, groups and organizations)" (Van Dijk 2006: 20). For Van Dijk networks have become the nervous system of society, whereas Castells links the concept of the network society to capitalist transformation, Van Dijk sees it as the logical result of the increasing widening and thickening of networks in nature and society. [[Darin Barney]] uses the term for characterizing societies that exhibit two fundamental characteristics: "The first is the presence in those societies of sophisticated – almost exclusively digital – technologies of networked communication and information management/distribution, technologies which form the basic infrastructure mediating an increasing array of social, political and economic practices. (…) The second, arguably more intriguing, characteristic of network societies is the reproduction and institutionalization throughout (and between) those societies of networks as the basic form of human organization and relationship across a wide range of social, political and economic configurations and associations".&lt;ref&gt;[[Darin Barney]] (2003) The Network Society. Cambridge: Polity, 25sq&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Critiques ===
The major critique of concepts such as information society, knowledge society, network society, postmodern society, postindustrial society, etc. that has mainly been voiced by critical scholars is that they create the impression that we have entered a completely new type of society. "If there is just more information then it is hard to understand why anyone should suggest that we have before us something radically new" (Webster 2002a: 259). Critics such as [[Frank Webster (sociologist)|Frank Webster]] argue that these approaches stress discontinuity, as if contemporary society had nothing in common with society as it was 100 or 150 years ago. Such assumptions would have ideological character because they would fit with the view that we can do nothing about change and have to adopt to existing political realities (kasiwulaya 2002b: 267).

These critics argue that contemporary society first of all is still a capitalist society oriented towards accumulating economic, political, and [[cultural capital]]. They acknowledge that information society theories stress some important new qualities of society (notably globalization and informatization), but charge that they fail to show that these are attributes of overall capitalist structures. Critics such as Webster insist on the continuities that characterise change. In this way Webster distinguishes between different epochs of capitalism: laissez-faire capitalism of the 19th century, [[corporate capitalism]] in the 20th century, and informational capitalism for the 21st century (kasiwulaya 2006).

For describing contemporary society based on a dialectic of the old and the new, continuity and discontinuity, other critical scholars have suggested several terms like:
* transnational network capitalism, transnational informational capitalism ([[Christian Fuchs (sociologist)|Christian Fuchs]] 2008, 2007): "Computer networks are the technological foundation that has allowed the emergence of global network capitalism, that is, regimes of accumulation, regulation, and discipline that are helping to increasingly base the accumulation of economic, political, and cultural capital on transnational network organizations that make use of cyberspace and other new technologies for global coordination and communication. [...] The need to find new strategies for executing corporate and political domination has resulted in a restructuration of capitalism that is characterized by the emergence of transnational, networked spaces in the economic, political, and cultural system and has been mediated by cyberspace as a tool of global coordination and communication. Economic, political, and cultural space have been restructured; they have become more fluid and dynamic, have enlarged their borders to a transnational scale, and handle the inclusion and exclusion of nodes in flexible ways. These networks are complex due to the high number of nodes (individuals, enterprises, teams, political actors, etc.) that can be involved and the high speed at which a high number of resources is produced and transported within them. But global network capitalism is based on structural inequalities; it is made up of segmented spaces in which central hubs (transnational corporations, certain political actors, regions, countries, Western lifestyles, and worldviews) centralize the production, control, and flows of economic, political, and cultural capital (property, power, definition capacities). This segmentation is an expression of the overall competitive character of contemporary society." (Fuchs 2008: 110+119).
* digital capitalism (Schiller 2000, cf. also [[Peter Glotz]]):&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter Glotz]] (1999) Die beschleunigte Gesellschaft. Kulturkämpfe im digitalen Kapitalismus. München: Kindler.&lt;/ref&gt; "networks are directly generalizing the social and cultural range of the capitalist economy as never before" (Schiller 2000: xiv)
* virtual capitalism: the "combination of marketing and the new information technology will enable certain firms to obtain higher profit margins and larger market shares, and will thereby promote greater concentration and centralization of capital" (Dawson/[[John Bellamy Foster]] 1998: 63sq),
* high-tech capitalism&lt;ref&gt;[[Wolfgang Fritz Haug]] (2003) High-Tech-Kapitalismus. Hamburg: Argument.&lt;/ref&gt; or informatic capitalism (Fitzpatrick 2002) – to focus on the computer as a guiding technology that has transformed the productive forces of capitalism and has enabled a globalized economy.

Other scholars prefer to speak of information capitalism (Morris-Suzuki 1997) or informational capitalism ([[Manuel Castells]] 2000, [[Christian Fuchs (sociologist)|Christian Fuchs]] 2005, Schmiede 2006a, b). Manuel Castells sees informationalism as a new technological paradigm (he speaks of a mode of development) characterized by "information generation, processing, and transmission" that have become "the fundamental sources of productivity and power" (Castells 2000: 21). The "most decisive historical factor accelerating, channelling and shaping the information technology paradigm, and inducing its associated social forms, was/is the process of capitalist restructuring undertaken since the 1980s, so that the new techno-economic system can be adequately characterized as informational capitalism" (Castells 2000: 18). Castells has added to theories of the information society the idea that in contemporary society dominant functions and processes are increasingly organized around networks that constitute the new social morphology of society (Castells 2000: 500). [[Nicholas Garnham]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Nicholas Garnham]] (2004) Information Society Theory as Ideology. In: Frank Webster (Ed.) (2004) The Information Society Reader. London: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; is critical of Castells and argues that the latter’s account is technologically determinist because Castells points out that his approach is based on a dialectic of technology and society in which technology embodies society and society uses technology (Castells 2000: 5sqq). But Castells also makes clear that the rise of a new "mode of development" is shaped by capitalist production, i.e. by society, which implies that technology isn't the only driving force of society.

[[Antonio Negri]] and [[Michael Hardt]] argue that contemporary society is an Empire that is characterized by a singular global logic of capitalist domination that is based on immaterial labour. With the concept of immaterial labour Negri and Hardt introduce ideas of information society discourse into their Marxist account of contemporary capitalism. Immaterial labour would be labour "that creates immaterial products, such as knowledge, information, communication, a relationship, or an emotional response" (Hardt/Negri 2005: 108; cf. also 2000: 280-303), or services, cultural products, knowledge (Hardt/Negri 2000: 290). There would be two forms: intellectual labour that produces ideas, symbols, codes, texts, linguistic figures, images, etc.; and [[affective labor|affective labour]] that produces and manipulates affects such as a feeling of ease, well-being, satisfaction, excitement, passion, joy, sadness, etc. (Ibid.).

Overall, neo-Marxist accounts of the information society have in common that they stress that knowledge, information technologies, and computer networks have played a role in the restructuration and globalization of capitalism and the emergence of a flexible regime of accumulation ([[David Harvey (geographer)|David Harvey]] 1989). They warn that new technologies are embedded into societal antagonisms that cause [[structural unemployment]], rising poverty, [[social exclusion]], the [[deregulation]] of the [[welfare state]] and of [[labour rights]], the lowering of wages, welfare, etc.

Concepts such as knowledge society, information society, network society, informational capitalism, postindustrial society, transnational network capitalism, postmodern society, etc. show that there is a vivid discussion in contemporary sociology on the character of contemporary society and the role that technologies, information, communication, and co-operation play in it.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} Information society theory discusses the role of information and information technology in society, the question which key concepts shall be used for characterizing contemporary society, and how to define such concepts. It has become a specific branch of contemporary sociology.

==Second and third nature==
{{One source section|date=August 2017}}
Information society is the means of getting information from one place to another.{{sfn|Wark|1997|p=22}} As technology has advanced so too has the way people have adapted in sharing this information with each other.

"Second nature" refers a group of experiences that get made over by culture.{{sfn|Wark|1997|p=23}} They then get remade into something else that can then take on a new meaning. As a society we transform this process so it becomes something natural to us, i.e. second nature. So, by following a particular pattern created by culture we are able to recognise how we use and move information in different ways. From sharing information via different time zones (such as talking online) to information ending up in a different location (sending a letter overseas) this has all become a habitual process that we as a society take for granted.{{sfn|Wark|1997|p=21}}

However, through the process of sharing information vectors have enabled us to spread information even further. Through the use of these vectors information is able to move and then separate from the initial things that enabled them to move.{{sfn|Wark|1997|p=24}} From here, something called "third nature" has developed. An extension of second nature, third nature is in control of second nature. It expands on what second nature is limited by. It has the ability to mould information in new and different ways. So, third nature is able to ‘speed up, proliferate, divide, mutate, and beam in on us from else where.{{sfn|Wark|1997|p=25}} It aims to create a balance between the boundaries of space and time (see second nature). This can be seen through the telegraph, it was the first successful technology that could send and receive information faster than a human being could move an object.{{sfn|Wark|1997|p=26}} As a result different vectors of people have the ability to not only shape culture but create new possibilities that will ultimately shape society.

Therefore, through the use of second nature and third nature society is able to use and explore new vectors of possibility where information can be moulded to create new forms of interaction.{{sfn|Wark|1997|p=28}}

==Sociological uses==

In [[sociology]], '''''informational society''''' refers to a [[postmodernity|post-modern]] type of society. Theoreticians like [[Ulrich Beck]], [[Anthony Giddens]] and [[Manuel Castells]] argue that since the 1970s a transformation from [[industrial society]] to informational society has happened on a global scale.&lt;ref&gt;[[Leonid Grinin|Grinin, L.]] 2007. Periodization of History: A theoretic-mathematical analysis. In: [http://urss.ru/cgi-bin/db.pl?cp=&amp;page=Book&amp;id=53184&amp;lang=en&amp;blang=en&amp;list=1 ''History &amp; Mathematics'']. Moscow: KomKniga/URSS. P.10-38. {{ISBN|978-5-484-01001-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

As [[steam power]] was the technology standing behind industrial society, so [[information technology]] is seen as the catalyst for the changes in work organisation, societal structure and politics occurring in the late 20th century.

In the book ''[[Future Shock]]'', [[Alvin Toffler]] used the phrase '''super-industrial society''' to describe this type of society.  Other writers and thinkers have used terms like "[[post-industrial society]]" and "post-modern industrial society" with a similar meaning.

== Related terms ==
A number of terms in current use emphasize related but different aspects of the emerging global economic order.  The Information Society intends to be the most encompassing in that an economy is a subset of a society.  The [[Information Age]] is somewhat limiting, in that it refers to a 30-year period between the widespread use of computers and the [[knowledge economy]], rather than an emerging economic order.  The knowledge era is about the nature of the content, not the socioeconomic processes by which it will be traded.  The [[computer revolution]], and knowledge revolution refer to specific revolutionary transitions, rather than the end state towards which we are evolving. The [[Information Revolution]] relates with the well known terms agricultural revolution and [[industrial revolution]].
* The [[information economy]] and the [[knowledge economy]] emphasize the [[Content (media and publishing)|content]] or [[intellectual property]] that is being traded through an information market or [[knowledge market]], respectively. [[Electronic commerce]] and [[electronic business]] emphasize the nature of transactions and running a business, respectively, using the [[Internet]] and [[World-Wide Web]].  The [[digital economy]] focuses on trading bits in [[cyberspace]] rather than atoms in physical space.  The network economy stresses that businesses will work collectively in webs or as part of business ecosystems rather than as stand-alone units. [[Social networking]] refers to the process of collaboration on massive, global scales.  The [[internet economy]] focuses on the nature of markets that are enabled by the Internet.
* Knowledge services and knowledge value put content into an economic context. Knowledge services integrates [[Knowledge management]], within a [[Knowledge organization]], that trades in a [[Knowledge market]]. In order for individuals to receive more knowledge, surveillance is used. This relates to the use of Drones as a tool in order to gather knowledge on other individuals. Although seemingly synonymous, each term conveys more than nuances or slightly different views of the same thing.  Each term represents one attribute of the likely nature of economic activity in the emerging post-industrial society.  Alternatively, the new economic order will incorporate all of the above plus other attributes that have not yet fully emerged.
* In connection with the development of the information society, appeared [[information pollution]], evolving [[information ecology]] - associated with information [[hygiene]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/240515256_Information_ecology__a_viewpoint?ev=prf_pub Eryomin A.L. Information ecology - a viewpoint]// International Journal of Environmental Studies. - 1998. - Vol. 54. - pp. 241-253.&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, It is important to selectively select the information. Due to information revolution, the amount of information is puzzling. Among these, we need to develop techniques that refine information. This is called ''data mining.'' It is an engineering term, but it is used in sociology. In other words, if the amount of information was competitive in the past, the quality of information is important today.

==Intellectual property considerations==
One of the central paradoxes of the information society is that it makes information easily reproducible, leading to a variety of freedom/control problems relating to [[intellectual property]]. Essentially, business and capital, whose place becomes that of producing and selling information and knowledge, seems to require control over this new resource so that it can effectively be managed and sold as the basis of the information economy. However, such control can prove to be both technically and socially problematic. Technically because [[copy protection]] is often easily circumvented and socially ''rejected'' because the users and citizens of the information society can prove to be unwilling to accept such absolute [[commodification]] of the facts and information that compose their environment.

Responses to this concern range from the [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]] in the United States (and similar legislation elsewhere) which make [[copy protection]] (see [[Digital Rights Management|DRM]]) circumvention illegal, to the [[free software]], [[open source]] and [[copyleft]] movements, which seek to encourage and disseminate the "freedom" of various information products (traditionally both as in "gratis" or free of cost, and liberty, as in freedom to use, explore and share).

Caveat: Information society is often used by politicians meaning something like "we all do internet now"; the sociological term information society (or informational society) has some deeper implications about change of societal structure. Because we lack political control of intellectual property, we are lacking in a concrete map of issues, an analysis of costs and benefits, and functioning political groups that are unified by common interests representing different opinions of this diverse situation that are prominent in the information society.&lt;ref&gt;Boyle, James. “A Politics of Intellectual Property: Environmentalism for the Net?” Duke Law Journal, vol. 47, no. 1, 1997, pp. 87–116.

==Etymology==
[[File:Kawaii lolita manga.jpg|thumb|left|Cute manga drawing using kawaii basis (illustration by Daya Wyrd)]]
The word ''kawaii'' originally derives from the phrase {{lang|ja|[[:wikt:顔映し|顔映し]]}} ''kao hayushi'', which literally means "(one's) face (is) aglow," commonly used to refer to flushing or blushing of the face. The second morpheme is [[cognate]] with ''-bayu'' in [https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E7%9C%A9%E3%81%84 ''mabayui''] (眩い, 目映い, or 目映ゆい) "dazzling, glaring, blinding, too bright; dazzlingly beautiful" (''ma-'' is from 目 ''me'' "eye") and ''-hayu'' in ''omohayui'' (面映い or 面映ゆい) "embarrassed/embarrassing, awkward, feeling self-conscious/making one feel self-conscious" (''omo-'' is from 面 ''omo'', an archaic word for "face, looks, features; surface; image, semblance, vestige"). Over time, the meaning changed into the modern meaning of "cute", and the pronunciation changed to {{lang|ja|かわゆい}} ''kawayui'' and then to the modern {{lang|ja|かわいい}} ''kawaii''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|script-title=ja:かわいい|work = 語源由来辞典 (Dictionary of Etymology) |language=Japanese|url=http://gogen-allguide.com/ka/kawaii.html |accessdate = 20 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|script-title=ja:可愛い|work = デジタル大辞泉 (Digital Daijisen) |language=Japanese|url=http://dictionary.goo.ne.jp/leaf/jn2/46843/m0u/%E5%8F%AF%E6%84%9B%E3%81%84/ |accessdate = 20 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|script-title=ja:可愛いとは|work = 大辞林第3版(Daijirin 3rd Ed.) |language=Japanese|url=http://kotobank.jp/word/%E5%8F%AF%E6%84%9B%E3%81%84 |accessdate = 20 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is most commonly written in [[hiragana]], {{lang|ja|かわいい}}, but the [[ateji]], {{lang|ja|可愛い}}, has also been appended. The [[kanji]] in the ateji literally translates to "able to be loved, can/may love, lovable."

==History==
===Original definition===
[[File:JapaneseSchoolGirl-Sobuline-2011.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Kogal]] girl, identified by her shortened skirt. The soft bag and teddy bear that she carries are part of ''kawaii''.]]
The original definition of ''kawaii'' came from Lady Murasaki's ''[[The Tale of Genji]]'', where it referred to pitiable qualities.&lt;ref name="Shiokawa" /&gt; During the Shogunate period under the ideology of neo-Confucianism, women came to be included under the term ''kawaii'' as the perception of women being animalistic was replaced with the conception of women as docile.&lt;ref name="Shiokawa" /&gt; However, the earlier meaning survives in the modern Standard Japanese adjectival noun かわいそう ''kawaisō'' (often written with ''ateji'' as 可哀相 or 可哀想) "piteous, pitiable, arousing compassion, poor, sad, sorry" (etymologically from 顔映様 "face / projecting, reflecting, or transmitting light, flushing, [[blushing]] / seeming, appearance"). Forms of ''kawaii'' and its derivatives ''kawaisō'' and ''kawairashii'' (with the suffix ''-rashii'' "-like, -ly") are used in modern dialects to mean "embarrassing/embarrassed, shameful/ashamed" or "good, nice, fine, excellent, superb, splendid, admirable" in addition to the standard meanings of "adorable" and "pitiable."

===Cute handwriting===
The rise of [[cuteness]] in [[Japanese culture]] emerged in the 1970s as part of a new style of writing.&lt;ref name="kinsella"&gt;Kinsella, Sharon. 1995. "Cuties in Japan" [http://www.kinsellaresearch.com/new/Cuties%20in%20Japan.pdf] accessed August 1, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Many teenage girls began to write laterally using [[mechanical pencil]]s.&lt;ref name=kinsella/&gt; These pencils produced very fine lines, as opposed to traditional [[Japanese writing]] that varied in thickness and was vertical.&lt;ref name=kinsella/&gt; The girls would also write in big, round characters and they added little pictures to their writing, such as hearts, stars, emoticon faces, and letters of the Latin alphabet.&lt;ref name=kinsella/&gt;

These pictures would be inserted randomly and made the writing difficult to read.&lt;ref name=kinsella/&gt; As a result, this writing style caused a lot of controversy and was banned in many schools.&lt;ref name=kinsella/&gt; During the 1980s, however, this new "cute" writing was adopted by [[magazines]] and [[comics]] and was put onto packaging and advertising.&lt;ref name=kinsella/&gt;

From 1984 to 1986, {{nihongo|Kazuma Yamane|山根一眞|Yamane Kazuma}} studied the development of cute handwriting, which he called Anomalous Female Teenage Handwriting, in depth.&lt;ref name=kinsella/&gt; This type of cute Japanese handwriting has also been called: {{nihongo|marui ji|[[:wikt:丸い|丸い]][[:wikt:字|字]]}}, meaning "round writing", {{nihongo|koneko ji|[[:wikt:小猫|小猫]]字}}, meaning "kitten writing", {{nihongo|manga ji|[[:wikt:漫画|漫画]]字}}, meaning "comic writing", and {{nihongo|burikko ji|[[:wikt:鰤|鰤]][[:wikt:子|子]]字}}, meaning "fake-child writing".&lt;ref&gt;Skov, L. (1995). Women, media, and consumption in [[Japan]]. Hawai'i Press, USA.&lt;/ref&gt; Although it was commonly thought that the writing style was something that teenagers had picked up from [[comics]], he found that teenagers had come up with the style themselves, spontaneously, as an underground trend. His conclusion was based on an observation that cute handwriting predates the availability of technical means for producing rounded writing in comics.&lt;ref name=kinsella/&gt;

===Cute merchandise===
[[File:Japanese kawaii doll.jpg|thumb|left|''Kawaii'' doll]]
{{nihongo|Tomoyuki Sugiyama|杉山奉文|Sugiyama Tomoyuki}}, author of Cool Japan, says cute fashion in Japan can be traced back to the [[Edo period]] with the popularity of [[netsuke]].&lt;ref name="theage"&gt;''TheAge.Com:'' "Japan smitten by love of cute" http://www.theage.com.au/news/people/cool-or-infantile/2006/06/18/1150569208424.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of this growing trend, companies such as [[Sanrio]] came out with merchandise like [[Hello Kitty]]. Hello Kitty was an immediate success and the obsession with cute continued to progress in other areas as well. More recently, Sanrio has released kawaii characters with deeper personalities that appeal to an older audience, such as [[Gudetama]] and [[Aggretsuko]]. These characters have enjoyed strong popularity as fans are drawn to their unique quirks in addition to their cute aesthetics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The New Breed of Kawaii – Characters Who Get Us|url=https://www.umamibrain.com/single-post/2017/09/18/The-New-Breed-of-Kawaii-%25E2%2580%2593-Characters-Who-Get-Us|website=UmamiBrain|accessdate=29 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1980s also saw the rise of cute idols, such as [[Seiko Matsuda]], who is largely credited with popularizing the trend. Women began to emulate Seiko Matsuda and her cute fashion style and mannerisms, which emphasized the helplessness and innocence of young girls.&lt;ref&gt;See {{cite web |url=http://www.jref.com/forum/showthread.php?t=16924 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-02-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101124094006/http://jref.com/forum/showthread.php?t=16924 |archivedate=2010-11-24 |df= }} URL accessed February 11, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The market for cute merchandise in Japan used to be driven by Japanese girls between 15 and 18 years old.&lt;ref&gt;''Time Asia'': Young Japan: She's a material girl http://www.time.com/time/asia/asia/magazine/1999/990503/style1.html&lt;/ref&gt; No longer limited to teenagers, the spread of making things as cute as possible, even common household items, is embraced by people of all ages.

==Aesthetics==
[[File:Girls in Harajuku --- Kawaii?.jpg|thumb|Kawaii styled luggage]]
{{nihongo|Soichi Masubuchi|増淵宗一|Masubuchi Sōichi}}, in his work ''Kawaii Syndrome'', claims "cute" and "neat" have taken precedence over the former Japanese aesthetics of "beautiful" and "refined".&lt;ref name="Shiokawa"&gt;Shiokawa. "Cute But Deadly: Women and Violence in Japanese Comics". ''Themes and Issues in Asian Cartooning: Cute, Cheap, Mad and Sexy''. Ed. John A. Lent. Bowling Green, Kentucky: Bowling Green State University Popular Press, 1999. 93–125. {{ISBN|0-87972-779-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; As a cultural phenomenon, [[cuteness]] is increasingly accepted in Japan as a part of [[Japanese culture]] and national identity. {{nihongo|Tomoyuki Sugiyama|杉山奉文|Sugiyama Tomoyuki}}, author of ''[[Cool Japan]]'', believes that "cuteness" is rooted in Japan's harmony-loving culture, and {{nihongo|Nobuyoshi Kurita|栗田経惟|Kurita Nobuyoshi}}, a sociology professor at [[Musashi University]] in [[Tokyo]], has stated that "cute" is a "magic term" that encompasses everything that is acceptable and desirable in Japan.&lt;ref name=ap2006&gt;Quotes and paraphrases from: {{cite news|title=Cuteness a hot-selling commodity in Japan|author=Yuri Kageyama|date=June 14, 2006|publisher=[[Associated Press]]|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/06/14/AR2006061401122.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gender performance===
Japanese women who feign kawaii behaviors (e.g., high-pitched voice, squealing giggles&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Merry White|title=The material child: coming of age in Japan and America|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vom1N-653voC&amp;pg=PA129|accessdate=19 July 2011|date=29 September 1994|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-08940-2|pages=129}}&lt;/ref&gt;) that could be viewed as forced or inauthentic are called ''[[burikko]]'' and this is considered a [[Gender performativity|gender performance]].&lt;ref name="Miller"&gt;"You are doing ''burikko''!: Censoring/scrutinizing artificers of cute femininity in Japanese," Laura Miller in ''Japanese Language, Gender, and Ideology: Cultural Models and Real People'', edited by Janet Shibamoto Smith and Shigeko Okamoto, Oxford University Press, 2004. In Japanese.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[neologism]] developed in the 1980s, perhaps originated by comedian {{nihongo|Kuniko Yamada|山田邦子|Yamada Kuniko}}.&lt;ref name="Miller" /&gt;

===Physical attractiveness===
In Japan, being cute is acceptable for both men and women. A trend existed of men shaving their legs to mimic the [[Neoteny|neotenic]] look. Japanese women often try to act cute to attract men.&lt;ref name="Bremmer" /&gt; A study by Kanebo, a cosmetic company, found that Japanese women in their 20s and 30s favored the "cute look" with a "childish round face".&lt;ref name="theage" /&gt; Women also employ a look of innocence in order to further play out this idea of cuteness. Having large eyes is one aspect that exemplifies innocence; therefore many Japanese women attempt to alter the size of their eyes. To create this illusion, women may wear large [[contact lens]]es, [[false eyelashes]], dramatic eye makeup, and even have an [[East Asian blepharoplasty]], commonly known as double eyelid surgery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=RiRi|first=Madame|title=Some Japanese customs that may confuse foreigners.|url=http://www.japantoday.com/category/lifestyle/view/some-japanese-customs-that-may-confuse-foreigners|publisher=Japan Today|accessdate=25 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Idols===
[[File:Japan Expo 2012 (3).jpg|thumb|[[Momoiro Clover Z]] performing at [[Japan Expo]]]]
{{nihongo|[[Japanese idol|Idols]]|アイドル|aidoru}} are media personalities in their teens and twenties who are considered particularly attractive or cute and who will, for a period ranging from several months to a few years, regularly appear in the mass media, e.g. as singers for [[Pop music|pop]] groups, bit-part actors, TV personalities (''[[tarento]]''), models in photo spreads published in magazines, advertisements, etc. (But not every young celebrity is considered an idol. Young celebrities who wish to cultivate a rebellious image, such as many rock musicians, reject the "idol" label.) [[Speed (Japanese band)|Speed]], [[Morning Musume]], [[AKB48]], and [[Momoiro Clover Z]] are examples of popular idol groups in Japan during the 2000s &amp; 2010s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ajw.asahi.com/article/cool_japan/culture/aj201208290008 |title=Momoiro Clover Z dazzles audiences with shiny messages of hope |work=[[The Asahi Shimbun]] |date=2012-08-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131024003154/http://ajw.asahi.com/article/cool_japan/culture/AJ201208290008 |archivedate=2013-10-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cute fashion===
====Lolita====
[[File:Pink gothlolita.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Sweet Lolita]] fashion in Japan]]
[[Lolita fashion]] is a very well-known and recognizable style in Japan. Based on Victorian fashion and the [[Rococo]] period, girls mix in their own elements along with gothic style to achieve the porcelain-doll look.&lt;ref name="Fort 2010"&gt;{{cite book|last=Fort|first=Emeline|title=A Guide to Japanese Street Fashion|year=2010|publisher=6 Degrees}}&lt;/ref&gt; The girls who dress in Lolita fashion try to look cute, innocent, and beautiful.&lt;ref name="Fort 2010"/&gt; This look is achieved with lace, ribbons, bows, ruffles, bloomers, aprons, and ruffled petticoats. Parasols, chunky Mary Jane heels, and Bo Peep collars are also very popular.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Holson|first=Laura|title=Gothic Lolitas: Demure vs. Dominatrix|newspaper=New York Times|date=13 March 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sweet Lolita]] is a subset of Lolita fashion that includes even more ribbons, bows, and lace, and is often fabricated out of pastels and other light colors. Another subset of Lolita fashion related to "sweet Lolita" is Fairy Kei. Head-dresses such as giant bows or bonnets are also very common, while lighter make-up is also used to achieve a more natural look. Curled hair extensions, sometimes accompanied by eyelash extensions, are also popular in helping with the baby doll look.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite book|last=Fort|first=Emmeline|title=A Guide to Japanese Street Fashion|year=2010|publisher=6 Degrees}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Themes such as fruits, flowers and sweets are often used as patterns on the fabrics used for dresses. Purses often go with the themes and are shaped as hearts, strawberries, or stuffed animals. ''Baby, the Stars Shine Bright'' is one of the more popular clothing stores for this style and often carries themes. Mannerisms are also important to many Sweet Lolitas. Sweet Lolita is not only a fashion, but also a lifestyle.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; This is evident in the 2004 film ''[[Kamikaze Girls]]'' where the main Lolita character, Momoko, drinks only tea and eats only sweets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mitani|first=Koki|title=Kamikaze Girls|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0416220/|publisher=IMDB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Decora====
[[File:Rainbow Decora.jpg|thumb|upright|Example of Decora fashion]]
Decora is a style that is characterized by wearing lots of "decorations" on oneself. It is considered to be self-decoration. The goal of this fashion is to become as vibrant and characterized as possible. People who take part in this fashion trend wear accessories such as multicolor hair pins, bracelets, rings, necklaces, etc. By adding on multiple layers of accessories on an outfit, the fashion trend tends to have a childlike appearance. It also includes toys and multicolor clothes.

====Kawaii men====
Although kawaii is typically a female-dominated fashion, there are men who decide to partake in this trend. Some men decide to transform themselves into women, more specifically kawaii women. They are able to transform themselves by wearing wigs, false eyelashes, applying makeup, and wearing kawaii female clothing.&lt;ref name="Suzuki"&gt;{{cite web|last=Suzuki |first=Kirin |title=Makeup Changes Men |url=http://tokyokawaiietc.com/archives/9397 |publisher=Tokyo Kawaii, Etc |accessdate=11 April 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130721100514/http://tokyokawaiietc.com/archives/9397 |archivedate=21 July 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is seen predominately in male entertainers, such as Torideta-san, a DJ who transforms himself into a kawaii woman when working at his nightclub.&lt;ref name="Suzuki"/&gt;

Japanese pop stars and actors often have longer hair, such as [[Takuya Kimura]] of [[SMAP]]. Men are also noted as often aspiring to a [[Neoteny|neotenic]] look. While it doesn't quite fit the exact specifications of what cuteness means for females, men are certainly influenced by the same societal mores - to be attractive in a specific sort of way that the society finds acceptable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bennette|first=Colette|title=It's all Kawaii: Cuteness in Japanese Culture|url=http://geekout.blogs.cnn.com/2011/11/18/its-all-kawaii-cuteness-in-japanese-culture/|publisher=CNN|accessdate=11 April 2013|date=18 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this way both Japanese men and women conform to the expectations of Kawaii in some way or another.

===Products===
The concept of ''kawaii'' has had an influence on a variety of products, including candy, such as [[Hi-Chew]], [[Koala's March]] and [[Hello Panda]]. Cuteness can be added to products by adding cute features, such as hearts, flowers, stars and rainbows. Cute elements can be found almost everywhere in Japan, from big business to corner markets and national government, ward, and town offices.&lt;ref name="Bremmer"&gt;[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2002-06-24/in-japan-cute-conquers-all ''Bloomberg Businessweek'', "In Japan, Cute Conquers All"].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cute Inc."&gt;{{cite news | url= https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/7.12/cute.html | title= Cute Inc.| publisher=WIRED|date=December 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many companies, large and small, use cute mascots to present their wares and services to the public. For example:

* [[Resona Holdings|Asahi Bank]] used [[Miffy]] (Nijntje), a character from a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] series of children's picture books, on some of its ATM and credit cards.
* The [[prefectures of Japan]], as well as many cities and cultural institutions, have cute [[mascot]] characters known as [[yuru-chara]] to promote tourism. [[Kumamon]], the [[Kumamoto Prefecture]] mascot, and [[Hikonyan]], the city of [[Hikone]] mascot, are among the most popular.&lt;ref name="Top Ten Japanese Character Mascots"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://findingfukuoka.com/2012/01/13/top-ten-japanese-character-mascots/ |title=Top Ten Japanese Character Mascots |publisher=Finding Fukuoka |date=2012-01-13 |accessdate=2013-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Japan Post]] "Yū-Pack" mascot is a stylized mailbox;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.post.japanpost.jp/navi/main.htm Japan Post site showing mailbox mascot] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060221113156/http://www.post.japanpost.jp/navi/main.htm |date=2006-02-21 }} URL accessed April 19, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; they also use other cute mascot characters to promote their various services (among them the Postal Savings Bank) and have used many such on postage stamps.
* Some [[police]] forces in Japan have their own [[moe (slang)|moe]] mascots, which sometimes adorn the front of [[kōban]] (police boxes).
* [[NHK]], the public broadcaster, has its own cute mascots. [[Domo (NHK)|Domokun]], the unique-looking and widely recognized NHK mascot, was introduced in 1998 and quickly took on a life of its own, appearing in [[Internet memes]] and fan art around the world.
* [[Sanrio]], the company behind [[Hello Kitty]] and other similarly cute characters, runs the [[Sanrio Puroland]] [[theme park]] in Tokyo, and painted on some [[EVA Air]] [[Airbus A330]] jets as well. Sanrio’s line of more than 50 characters takes in more than $1 billion a year and it remains the most successful company to capitalize on the cute trend.&lt;ref name="Cute Inc." /&gt;

====Non-''kawaii'' imports====
[[File:Kawaii goods.jpg|thumb|left|Kawaii goods outlet in 100 yen shop]]
There have been occasions in which popular Western products failed to meet the expectations of ''kawaii'', and thus did not do well in the Japanese market. For example, [[Cabbage Patch Kids]] dolls did not sell well in Japan, because the Japanese considered their facial features to be "ugly" and "grotesque" compared to the flatter and almost featureless faces of characters such as [[Hello Kitty]].&lt;ref name="Shiokawa" /&gt; Also, the doll [[Barbie]], portraying an adult woman, did not become successful in Japan compared to Takara's [[Licca-chan|Licca]], a doll that was modeled after an 11-year-old girl.&lt;ref name="Shiokawa" /&gt;

Kawaii has gradually gone from a small subculture in Japan to an important part of Japanese modern culture as a whole. There is an overwhelming amount of modern items featuring kawaii themes, not only in Japan, but worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jref.com/forum/all-things-japanese-26/research-paper-kawaii-culture-cuteness-16924/ (Research Paper) Kawaii: Culture of Cuteness&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130118001552/http://www.jref.com/forum/all-things-japanese-26/research-paper-kawaii-culture-cuteness-16924/ |date=2013-01-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; And characters associated with kawaii have an astounding popularity these days. We can see the "global cute" by the billion-dollar sellers like [[Pokémon]] and [[Hello Kitty]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Roach, Mary. "Cute Inc."

Japan has become a powerhouse in the kawaii industry and images of [[Doraemon]], [[Hello Kitty]], [[Pikachu]], [[Sailor Moon]] and [[Hamtaro]] are popular in mobile phone accessories. However, Professor Tian Shenliang says that Japan's future is dependent on how much of an impact kawaii brings to humanity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epochtw.com/6/10/27/39668.htm 卡哇伊熱潮 扭轉日本文化&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130301054943/http://epochtw.com/6/10/27/39668.htm |date=2013-03-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Japanese Foreign Ministry has also recognized the power of cute merchandise and have sent three 18-year-old women overseas in the hopes of spreading Japanese culture around the world. The women are dressed in uniforms and maid costumes that are commonplace in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chinataiwan.org/wh/sdgl/200904/t20090402_861472.htm|title=日本的"卡哇伊文化"_中国台湾网&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|publisher=|accessdate=5 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kawaii manga and magazines have brought tremendous profit to Japanese press industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://go.huanqiu.com/asia/2011-09/1969974_2.html|title=“萌文化”在日本大行其道_旅游_环球网|first=|last=王力|website=go.huanqiu.com|accessdate=5 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the worldwide revenue from the computer game and its merchandising peripherals are closing in on $5 billion, according to a [[Nintendo]] press release titled "It's a Pokémon Planet".&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

==Influence upon other cultures==
{{tone|section |date=July 2013}}
Kawaii products are seemingly gaining more popularity beyond the borders of Japan into other Asian markets, and it's seemingly becoming more popular in the [[United States|US]], especially among the young anime and manga fans as well as among those who are influenced by Japanese culture. Cute merchandise and products are especially popular in other parts of [[East Asia]], such as [[China]], [[Hong Kong]], [[South Korea]], [[Taiwan]] and [[Southeast Asian]] countries like the [[Philippines]], [[Singapore]], [[Thailand]], and [[Vietnam]].&lt;ref name="Cute Inc." /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/90086?tid=relatedcl|title=Cute Power!|date=7 November 1999|publisher=|accessdate=5 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sebastian Masuda, owner of 6%DOKIDOKI and a global advocate for kawaii influence, takes the quality from Harajuku to Western markets in his stores and artwork. The underlying belief of this Japanese designer is that "kawaii" actually saves the world.&lt;ref&gt;(Kataoka, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; The infusion of kawaii into other world markets and cultures is achieved by introducing kawaii via modern art; audio, visual, and written media; and the fashion trends of Japanese youth, especially in high school girls.&lt;ref name="ebscohost"&gt;Tadao, T.

The dissemination of Japanese youth fashion and "kawaii culture" is usually associated with the Western society and trends set by designers borrowed or taken from Japan.&lt;ref name="ebscohost"/&gt; With the emergence of China, South Korea and Singapore as economic centers in Asia, the Kawaii merchandise and product popularity has shifted back to the East. In these Asian markets, the kawaii concept takes on various forms and different types of presentation depending on the target audience.

[[Taiwanese culture]], the government in particular, has embraced and elevated kawaii to a new level of social consciousness. The introduction of the A-Bian doll was seen as the development of a symbol to advance democracy and assist in constructing a collective imagination and national identity for Taiwanese people. The A-Bian dolls are kawaii likeness of sports figure, famous individuals, and now political figures that use kawaii images as a means of self-promotion and potential votes.&lt;ref&gt;[1]A-Bian Family. http://www.akibo.com.tw/home/gallery/mark/03.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The creation of the A-Bian doll has allowed Taiwanese President Chen staffers to create a new culture where the "kawaii" image of a politician can be used to mobilize support and gain election votes.&lt;ref&gt;Chuang, Y.

Japanese popular "kawaii culture" has had an effect on Singaporean youth. The emergence of Japanese culture can be traced back to the mid-1980s when Japan became one of the economic powers in the world. Kawaii has developed from a few children's television shows to an Internet sensation.&lt;ref&gt;[2]All things Kawaii. http://www.allthingskawaii.net/links/&lt;/ref&gt; Japanese media is used so abundantly in Singapore that youths are more likely to imitate the fashion of their Japanese idols, learn the Japanese language, and continue purchasing Japanese oriented merchandise.&lt;ref&gt;Hao, X., Teh, L.L.

The Asian countries of China, Hong Kong, South Korea, and Thailand either produce kawaii items for international consumption or have websites that cater for kawaii as part of the youth culture in their country. Kawaii has taken on a life of its own, spawning the formation of kawaii websites, kawaii home pages, kawaii browser themes and finally, kawaii social networking pages. While Japan is the origin and Mecca of all things kawaii, artists and businesses around the world are imitating the kawaii theme.&lt;ref name="ibukimagazine.com"&gt;Rutledge, B. (2010, October). I love kawaii. ''Ibuki'' Magazine. 1–2. Retrieved from: http://ibukimagazine.com/lifestyle-/other-trends/212-i-love-kawaii&lt;/ref&gt;

Kawaii has truly become "greater" than itself. The interconnectedness of today's world via the Internet has taken kawaii to new heights of exposure and acceptance, producing a kawaii "movement".&lt;ref name="ibukimagazine.com"/&gt;

The Kawaii concept has become something of a global phenomenon. The aesthetic cuteness of Japan is very appealing to people globally. The wide popularity of Japanese kawaii is often credited with it being "culturally odorless". The elimination of exoticism and national branding has helped kawaii to reach numerous target audiences and span every culture, class, and gender group.&lt;ref&gt;Shearin, M. (2011, October).

Retrieved from: http://www.wm.edu/research/ideation/ideation-stories-for-borrowing/2011/triumph-of-kawaii5221.php&lt;/ref&gt; The palatable characteristics of kawaii have made it a global hit, resulting in Japan's global image shifting from being known for [[Japanese rock garden|austere rock gardens]] to being known for "cute-worship".&lt;ref name="theage" /&gt;

In 2014 the ''[[Collins English Dictionary]]'' in the [[United Kingdom]] entered "kawaii" into their then latest edition, defining as a "Japanese artistic and cultural style that emphasizes the quality of cuteness, using bright colours and characters with a childlike appearance."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat/29761389|publisher=[[BBC]]|title=Kawaii culture in the UK: Japan's trend for cute|date=24 October 2014|accessdate=26 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Kerr–Newman metric''' is a solution of the [[Einstein's field equation#Einstein–Maxwell equations|Einstein–Maxwell equations]] in [[general relativity]] that describes the spacetime geometry in the region surrounding a charged, rotating mass. This solution has not been especially useful for describing astrophysical phenomena, because observed astronomical objects do not possess an appreciable net [[electric charge]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}} The solution has instead been of primarily theoretical and mathematical interest. (It is assumed that the [[cosmological constant]] equals zero.)

==History==
In 1965, [[Ezra T. Newman|Ezra "Ted" Newman]] found the axisymmetric solution of Einstein's field equation for a black hole which is both rotating and electrically charged.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Newman |first=Ezra |last2=Janis |first2=Allen |title=Note on the Kerr Spinning-Particle Metric |journal=[[Journal of Mathematical Physics]] |volume=6 |issue=6 |pages=915–917 |date=1965 |doi=10.1063/1.1704350 |bibcode = 1965JMP.....6..915N }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Newman |first=Ezra |last2=Couch |first2=E. |last3=Chinnapared |first3=K. |last4=Exton |first4=A. |last5=Prakash |first5=A. |last6=Torrence |first6=R. |title=Metric of a Rotating, Charged Mass |journal=Journal of Mathematical Physics |volume=6 |issue=6 |pages=918–919 |date=1965 |doi=10.1063/1.1704351 |bibcode = 1965JMP.....6..918N }}&lt;/ref&gt; This formula for the [[metric tensor]] &lt;math&gt;g_{\mu \nu} \!&lt;/math&gt; is called the Kerr–Newman metric. It is a generalisation of the [[Kerr metric]] for an uncharged spinning point-mass, which had been discovered by [[Roy Kerr]] two years earlier.&lt;ref name="kerr_1963"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Kerr | first = RP | authorlink = Roy Kerr | date = 1963 | title = Gravitational field of a spinning mass as an example of algebraically special metrics | journal = Physical Review Letters | volume = 11 | pages = 237–238 | doi = 10.1103/PhysRevLett.11.237 | bibcode=1963PhRvL..11..237K | url=http://prola.aps.org/abstract/PRL/v11/i5/p237_1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Four related solutions may be summarized by the following table:

{| class="wikitable" style="margin: 1em auto"
| 
| Non-rotating (''J'' = 0)
| Rotating (''J'' ≠ 0)
|- 
| Uncharged (''Q'' = 0)
| [[Schwarzschild metric|Schwarzschild]]
| [[Kerr metric|Kerr]]
|-
| Charged (''Q'' ≠ 0)
| [[Reissner–Nordström metric|Reissner–Nordström]]
| Kerr–Newman 
|}

where ''Q'' represents the body's [[electric charge]] and ''J'' represents its spin [[angular momentum]].

==Mathematical form==
The Kerr–Newman metric describes the geometry of [[spacetime]] for a rotating charged black hole with mass ''M'', charge ''Q'' and angular momentum ''J''. The formula for this metric depends upon what coordinates or [[coordinate conditions]] are selected.  One way to express this metric is by writing down its [[line element]] in a particular set of [[Spherical coordinate system|spherical coordinates]],&lt;ref&gt;Hajicek, Petr et al.  [https://books.google.com/books?id=1vEe-8ktTJsC&amp;pg=PA243 An Introduction to the Relativistic Theory of Gravitation], page 243 (Springer 2008).&lt;/ref&gt; also called [[Boyer–Lindquist coordinates]]:

:&lt;math&gt;c^{2} d\tau^{2} = 
-\left(\frac{dr^2}{\Delta} + d\theta^2 \right) \rho^2 + \left(c \, dt - a \sin^2 \theta \, d\phi \right)^2 \frac{\Delta}{\rho^2} - \left(\left(r^2 + a^2 \right) d\phi - a c\, dt \right)^2 \frac{\sin^2 \theta}{\rho^2}&lt;/math&gt;

where the coordinates (''r'', ''θ'', ''ϕ'') are standard [[oblate spheroidal coordinate system]], and the length-scales:

:&lt;math&gt;
a = \frac{J}{Mc}\,,
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\ \rho^{2}=r^2+a^2\cos^2\theta\,,
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\ \Delta=r^2-r_sr+a^2+r_Q^2\,,
&lt;/math&gt;

have been introduced for brevity. Here ''r&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the [[Schwarzschild radius]] of the massive body, which is related to its total mass-equivalent ''M'' by

:&lt;math&gt;
r_{s} = \frac{2GM}{c^{2}}
&lt;/math&gt;

where ''G'' is the [[gravitational constant]], and ''r''&lt;sub&gt;''Q''&lt;/sub&gt; is a length-scale corresponding to the [[electric charge]] ''Q'' of the mass

:&lt;math&gt;
r_{Q}^{2} = \frac{Q^{2}G}{4\pi\epsilon_{0} c^{4}}
&lt;/math&gt;

where 1/(4π''ε''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) is [[Coulomb's law|Coulomb's force constant]].

The total mass-equivalent ''M'', which also contains the [[Electric potential energy|electric field-energy]] and the [[rotational energy]], and the irreducible mass ''M''&lt;sub&gt;irr&lt;/sub&gt; are related by&lt;ref&gt;[[Thibault Damour]]: [http://lapth.cnrs.fr/pg-nomin/chardon/IRAP_PhD/BlackHolesNice2012.pdf#page=11 Black Holes: Energetics and Thermodynamics], page 11&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Parthapratim Pradhan: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/1310.7126.pdf#page=9 Black Hole Interior Mass Formula], page 9, Eq. 57&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;M_{\rm irr} = \frac{\sqrt{2 M^2-r^2_Q c^4/G^2+2 M \sqrt{M^2-(r^2_Q +a^2) c^4/G^2}}}{2} \ \to \ M=\sqrt{\frac{16 M_{\rm irr}^4+8 M_{\rm irr}^2 \ r^2_Q c^4/G^2+r^4_Q c^8/G^4}{16 M_{\rm irr}^2-4a^2 c^4/G^2}}&lt;/math&gt;

In order to electrically charge and/or spin a neutral and static body, energy has to be applied to the system. Due to the [[mass–energy equivalence]], this energy also has a mass-equivalent; therefore ''M'' is always higher than ''M''&lt;sub&gt;irr&lt;/sub&gt;. If for example the rotational energy of a black hole is extracted via the [[Penrose process]]es&lt;ref name="mtw"&gt;[[Charles Misner]], [[Kip Thorne|Kip S. Thorne]], [[John Archibald Wheeler|John. A. Wheeler]]: ''[https://www.pdf-archive.com/2016/03/21/gravitation-misner-thorne-wheeler/ Gravitation]'', pages 877 &amp; 908&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bhat"&gt;Bhat, Dhurandhar &amp; Dadhich: [https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02715080 Energetics of the Kerr–Newman Black Hole by the Penrose Process], page 94 ([http://1oJcZf PDF]: page 11)&lt;/ref&gt;, the remaining mass-energy will always stay greater than or equal to ''M''&lt;sub&gt;irr&lt;/sub&gt;.

===Component form===
The components of the Kerr–Newman metric can be read off after a simple algebraic re-arrangement:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
c^{2} d\tau^{2} &amp; = \frac{(\Delta - a^2 \sin^2 \theta)}{\rho^2} \; c^2 \; dt^2 - \left(\frac{\rho^2}{\Delta} \right) dr^2  \\

&amp; - \rho^2 d\theta^2 + (a^2 \Delta \sin^2 \theta - r^4 - 2 r^2 a^2 - a^4) \frac{\sin^2 \theta \; d\phi^2}{\rho^2} \\
&amp; - (\Delta - r^2 - a^2) \frac{2 a \sin^2 \theta \; c \; dt \; d\phi}{\rho^2}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

===Electromagnetic field tensor===
The electromagnetic potential in Boyer–Lindquist coordinates is&lt;ref&gt;Brandon Carter: ''[https://luth.obspm.fr/~luthier/carter/trav/Carter68.pdf#page=3 Global structure of the Kerr family of gravitational fields]'' (1968)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="luongo"&gt;Orlando Luongo, Hernando Quevedo: ''[https://arxiv.org/pdf/1407.1530.pdf#page=2 Characterizing repulsive gravity with curvature eigenvalues]''&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;A_{\mu}=\left( \frac{r \ r_Q }{\rho^2},0,0,-\frac{c^2 \ a \ r \ r_Q  \sin ^2 \theta }{\rho^2 \ G \ M} \right) &lt;/math&gt;

while the Maxwell-tensor is defined by

:&lt;math&gt;F_{\mu\nu} = \frac{\partial A_\nu}{\partial x^{\mu}} - \frac{\partial A_\mu}{\partial x^{\nu}} \ \to \ F^{\mu\nu}=g^{\mu\sigma} \ g^{\nu\kappa} \ F_{\sigma \kappa}&lt;/math&gt;

In combination with the [[Christoffel symbols]] the second order [[Kerr–Newman_metric#Equations_of_motion|equations of motion]] can be derived with

:&lt;math&gt;{{\ddot x^i = - \Gamma^i_{j k} \ {\dot x^j} \ {\dot x^k} + q \ {F^{i k}} \ {\dot x^j}} \ {g_{j k}}}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; is the charge per mass of the testparticle.

===Alternative (Kerr–Schild) formulation===
The Kerr–Newman metric can be expressed in "Kerr–Schild" form, using a particular set of [[Cartesian coordinate system|Cartesian coordinates]] as follows.&lt;ref name="Debney"&gt;Debney, G. et al.  [http://link.aip.org/link/?JMAPAQ/10/1842/1 "Solutions of the Einstein and Einstein–Maxwell Equations,"] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130223203626/http://link.aip.org/link/?JMAPAQ/10/1842/1 |date=2013-02-23 }} ''Journal of Mathematical Physics'', Volume 10, page 1842 (1969).  Especially see equations (7.10), (7.11) and (7.14).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Balasin, Herbert and Nachbagauer, Herbert.  [https://arxiv.org/abs/gr-qc/9312028v1 “Distributional Energy-Momentum Tensor of the Kerr–Newman Space-Time Family.”]  (Arxiv.org 1993), subsequently published in ''Classical and Quantum Gravity'', volume 11, pages 1453–1461, [http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&amp;cpsidt=4105419 abstract] (1994).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Berman, Marcelo.  “Energy of Black Holes and Hawking’s Universe” in ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=DGwYf8cOCq4C&amp;pg=PA148&amp;dq=%22Kerr-Newman%22+and+cartesian&amp;ei=zR5cSY6EC4KEzgTUwZCQDg#PPA149,M1 Trends in Black Hole Research]'', page 148 (Kreitler ed., Nova Publishers 2006).&lt;/ref&gt; These solutions were proposed by [[Roy Patrick Kerr|Kerr]] and [[Alfred Schild|Schild]] in 1965.

:&lt;math&gt;g_{\mu \nu} = \eta_{\mu \nu} + fk_{\mu}k_{\nu} \!&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;f = \frac{Gr^2}{r^4 + a^2z^2}\left[2Mr - Q^2 \right]&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{k} = ( k_{x} ,k_{y} ,k_{z} ) = \left( \frac{rx+ay}{r^2 + a^2} , \frac{ry-ax}{r^2 + a^2}, \frac{z}{r} \right) &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;k_{0} = 1. \!&lt;/math&gt;

Notice that '''k''' is a [[unit vector]].  Here ''M'' is the constant mass of the spinning object, ''Q'' is the constant charge of the spinning object, ''η'' is the [[Minkowski space#Standard basis|Minkowski tensor]], and ''a'' is a constant rotational parameter of the spinning object.  It is understood that the vector &lt;math&gt;\vec{a}&lt;/math&gt; is directed along the positive z-axis.  The quantity ''r'' is not the radius, but rather is implicitly defined like this:

:&lt;math&gt;1 = \frac{x^2+y^2}{r^2 + a^2} + \frac{z^2}{r^2}&lt;/math&gt;

Notice that the quantity ''r'' becomes the usual radius ''R''

:&lt;math&gt;r \to R = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2}&lt;/math&gt;

when the rotational parameter ''a'' approaches zero.  In this form of solution, units are selected so that the speed of light is unity (''c'' = 1).  In order to provide a complete solution of the [[Einstein's field equation#Einstein–Maxwell equations|Einstein–Maxwell Equations]], the Kerr–Newman solution not only includes a formula for the metric tensor, but also a formula for the electromagnetic potential:&lt;ref name="Debney" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Burinskii, A.  [https://books.google.com/books?id=sCrtjHPcY3gC&amp;pg=PA321&amp;dq=%22kerr-newman%22+and+%22potential%22+and+electromagnetic&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;ei=27ReSdjSAqSsyASVxIz6Bg#PPA321,M1 “Kerr Geometry Beyond the Quantum Theory”] in ''Beyond the Quantum'', page 321 (Theo Nieuwenhuizen ed., World Scientific 2007). The formula for the vector potential of Burinskii differs from that of Debney et al. merely by a gradient which does not affect the fields.&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;A_{\mu} = \frac{Qr^3}{r^4 + a^2z^2}k_{\mu}&lt;/math&gt;

At large distances from the source (R &gt;&gt; a), these equations reduce to the [[Reissner–Nordström metric]] with:

:&lt;math&gt;A_{\mu} = \frac{Q}{R}k_{\mu}&lt;/math&gt;

In the Kerr–Schild form of the Kerr–Newman metric, the determinant of the metric tensor is everywhere equal to negative one, even near the source.&lt;ref name="Exact"&gt;Stephani, Hans et al.  ''Exact Solutions of Einstein's Field Equations'' (Cambridge University Press 2003).

with &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; for the total energy and &lt;math&gt;L_z&lt;/math&gt; for the axial angular momentum. &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Carter constant]]:

:&lt;math&gt;C = p_{\theta}^{2} + \cos^{2}\theta \left( a^{2}(1 - E^{2}) + \frac{L_z^2}{ \sin^2\theta}\right) = a^2 \ (1-E^2) \ \sin^2 \delta + L_z^2 \ \tan^2 \delta = {\rm const.}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;p_{\theta} = \dot \theta \ \rho^2&lt;/math&gt; is the poloidial component of the testparticle's angular momentum, and &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt; the orbital inclination angle.

:&lt;math&gt;L_z = \frac{v^{\phi} \ \bar R}{\sqrt{1-v^2}} = {\rm const.}&lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;E = \sqrt{\frac{\Delta \ \rho^2}{(1-v^2) \ \chi}} + \Omega \ L_z = {\rm const.}&lt;/math&gt;

are also conserved quantities. 

:&lt;math&gt;\Omega = -\frac{g_{t\phi}}{g_{\phi\phi}} = \frac{a \left(2 r-Q^2\right)}{\chi }&lt;/math&gt;

is the frame dragging induced angular velocity. The shorthand term &lt;math&gt;\chi&lt;/math&gt; is defined by

:&lt;math&gt;\chi = \left(a ^2+r^2\right)^2-a ^2 \ \sin ^2 \theta  \ \Delta&lt;/math&gt;

The relation between the coordinate derivatives &lt;math&gt;\dot r, \ \dot \theta, \ \dot \phi&lt;/math&gt; and the local 3-velocity &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; is

:&lt;math&gt;v^{r} = \dot r \ \sqrt{\frac{\rho^2 \ (1-v^2)}{\Delta}}&lt;/math&gt;

for the radial,

:&lt;math&gt;v^{\theta} = \dot \theta \ \sqrt{\rho^2 \ (1-v^2) }&lt;/math&gt;

for the poloidial, 

:&lt;math&gt;v^{\phi} = \frac{L_z \sqrt{1-v^2}}{\bar R}&lt;/math&gt;

for the axial and

:&lt;math&gt;v =  \frac{\sqrt{\dot t^2-\varsigma^2}}{\dot t} = \sqrt{\frac{\chi \ (E-L_z \ \Omega )^2 -\Delta \ \rho^2}{\chi \ (E-L_z \ \Omega )^2}}&lt;/math&gt;

for the total local velocity, where

:&lt;math&gt;\bar R = \sqrt{-g_{\phi \phi}} = \sqrt{\frac{\chi}{\rho^2}} \ \sin \theta&lt;/math&gt;

is the axial radius of gyration (local circumference divided by 2π), and

:&lt;math&gt;\varsigma = \sqrt{g^{t t}}  = \frac{\chi }{\Delta \ \rho^2}&lt;/math&gt;

the gravitational time dilation component. The local radial escape velocity for a neutral particle is therefore

:&lt;math&gt;v_{\rm esc}=\frac{\sqrt{\varsigma^2-1}}{\varsigma} &lt;/math&gt;.

== Special cases and generalizations ==
The Kerr–Newman metric is a generalization of other [[exact solutions in general relativity]]:

* [[Kerr metric]] if the charge ''Q'' is zero.
* [[Reissner–Nordström metric]] if the angular momentum ''J'' (or ''a'') is zero.
* [[Schwarzschild metric]] if the charge ''Q'' and the angular momentum ''J'' (or ''a'') are zero.
* [[Minkowski space]] if the mass ''M'', the charge ''Q'', and the rotation parameter ''a'' are all zero. Also, if gravity is intended to be removed, Minkowski space arises if the gravitational constant G is zero (with electric and magnetic fields more complicated than simply the [[Magnetic moment#Magnetic field produced by a magnetic moment|fields of a charged magnetic dipole]]).
The Kerr–Newman solution (with cosmological constant equal to zero) is also a special case of more general exact solutions of the Einstein–Maxwell Equations.&lt;ref name="Exact" /&gt;

==Some aspects of the solution==
Newman's result represents the simplest [[stationary spacetime|stationary]], [[axial symmetry|axisymmetric]], asymptotically flat solution of [[Einstein's equations]] in the presence of an [[electromagnetic field]] in four dimensions. It is sometimes referred to as an "electrovacuum" solution of Einstein's equations.

Any Kerr–Newman source has its rotation axis aligned with its magnetic axis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Punsly|first=Brian|title=High‐Energy Gamma‐Ray Emission from Galactic Kerr–Newman Black Holes. I. The Central Engine|journal=The Astrophysical Journal|date=10 May 1998|volume=498|issue=2|doi=10.1086/305561|url=http://iopscience.iop.org/0004-637X/498/2/640/|accessdate=16 May 2013 |page=646 |quote=All Kerr–Newman black holes have their rotation axis and magnetic axis aligned; they cannot pulse.|bibcode = 1998ApJ...498..640P }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, a Kerr–Newman source is different from commonly observed astronomical bodies, for which there is a substantial angle between the rotation axis and the [[magnetic moment]].&lt;ref&gt;Lang, Kenneth. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=RdCUsMy3l7EC&amp;pg=PA96&amp;dq=%22magnetic+dipole+moment%22+and+%22axis%22+and+%22the+sun%22&amp;as_brr=3&amp;ei=4DFdScHGIo6syATH6NmRAQ The Cambridge Guide to the Solar System]'', page 96 (Cambridge University Press, 2003).&lt;/ref&gt;

If the Kerr–Newman potential is considered as a model for a classical electron, it predicts an electron having not just a magnetic dipole moment, but also other multipole moments, such as an electric quadrupole moment.&lt;ref name="Kjell"&gt;Rosquist, Kjell. [https://arxiv.org/abs/gr-qc/0412064v3 "Gravitationally Induced Electromagnetism at the Compton Scale,"] Arxiv.org (2006).&lt;/ref&gt;  An electron quadrupole moment has not been detected empirically yet.&lt;ref name="Kjell" /&gt;

In the G=0 limit, the electromagnetic fields are those of a charged rotating disk inside a ring where the fields are infinite.  The total field energy for this disk is infinite, and so this G=0 limit does not solve the problem of infinite [[self-energy]].&lt;ref&gt;Lynden-Bell, D.  [https://arxiv.org/abs/gr-qc/0410109v1 "Electromagnetic Magic: The Relativistically Rotating Disk,"] ''Physical Review D'', Volume 70, 105017 (2004).&lt;/ref&gt;

Like the [[Kerr metric]] for an uncharged rotating mass, the Kerr–Newman interior solution exists mathematically but is probably not representative of the actual metric of a physically realistic [[rotating black hole]] due to stability issues.  Although it represents a generalization of the Kerr metric, it is not considered as very important for astrophysical purposes since one does not expect that realistic [[black hole]]s have an important [[electric charge]].

The Kerr–Newman metric defines a black hole with an event horizon only when the following relation is satisfied:&lt;ref&gt;[[Reinhard Meinel]]. [https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-319-20046-0_6  "A Physical Derivation of the Kerr–Newman Black Hole Solution"].&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;a^2 + Q^2 \leq M^2.&lt;/math&gt;

An electron's ''a'' and ''Q'' (suitably specified in [[geometrized units]]) both exceed its mass ''M'', in which case the metric has no event horizon and thus there can be no such thing as a [[black hole electron]] — only a [[naked singularity|naked]] spinning ring singularity.&lt;ref&gt;Burinskii, Alexander.  [https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/0507109 "The Dirac-Kerr electron,"] Arxiv.org (2005).&lt;/ref&gt;  Such a metric has several seemingly unphysical properties, such as the ring's violation of the [[cosmic censorship hypothesis]], and also appearance of causality-violating [[closed timelike curve]]s in the immediate vicinity of the ring.&lt;ref&gt;[[Brandon Carter|Carter, Brandon]].  [http://prola.aps.org/abstract/PR/v174/i5/p1559_1 Global Structure of the Kerr Family of Gravitational Fields,] ''Physical Review'' 174, page 1559 (1968).&lt;/ref&gt;

The Russian theorist Alexander Burinskii wrote in 2007: "In this work we obtain an exact correspondence between the wave function of the Dirac equation and the spinor (twistorial) structure of the Kerr geometry. It allows us to assume that the Kerr–Newman geometry reflects the specific space-time structure of electron, and electron contains really the Kerr–Newman circular string of Compton size". The Burinskii paper describes an electron as a gravitationally confined ring singularity without an event horizon. It has some, but not all of the predicted properties of a black hole.&lt;ref&gt;Burinskii, Alexander. [https://arxiv.org/abs/0712.0577 "Kerr Geometry as Space-Time Structure of the Dirac Electron,"] Arxiv.org (2007).&lt;/ref&gt;

==The electromagnetic fields==
The electric and magnetic fields can be obtained in the usual way by differentiating the four-potential to obtain the [[Electromagnetic tensor|electromagnetic field strength tensor]].  It will be convenient to switch over to three-dimensional vector notation.

:&lt;math&gt;A_{\mu} = \left(-\phi, A_x, A_y, A_z \right) \,&lt;/math&gt;

The static electric and magnetic fields are derived from the vector potential and the scalar potential like this:
:&lt;math&gt;\vec{E} = - \vec{\nabla} \phi \,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\vec{B} = \vec{\nabla} \times \vec{A} \,&lt;/math&gt;
Using the Kerr–Newman formula for the four-potential in the Kerr–Schild form yields the following concise complex formula for the fields:&lt;ref&gt;Gair, Jonathan. [http://www.ast.cam.ac.uk/~jgair/research/kerrnewman.html "Boundstates in a Massless Kerr–Newman Potential"].&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\vec{E} + i\vec{B} = -\vec{\nabla}\Omega\,&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\Omega = \frac{Q}{\sqrt{(\vec{R}-i\vec{a})^2}} \,&lt;/math&gt;

The quantity omega (&lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt;) in this last equation is similar to the [[Electric potential#Electric potential due to a point charge|Coulomb potential]], except that the radius vector is shifted by an imaginary amount.  This complex potential was discussed as early as the nineteenth century, by the French mathematician [[Paul Émile Appell]].&lt;ref&gt;Appell, Math. Ann. xxx (1887) pp. 155–156.  Discussed by Whittaker, Edmund and Watson, George.  ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=ULVdGZmi9VcC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Whittaker+Watson+and+Appell+and+1887&amp;source=gbs_book_other_versions_r&amp;cad=1_1#PPA400,M1 A Course of Modern Analysis]'', page 400 (Cambridge University Press 1927).&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7768">The '''Kuleshov effect''' is a [[film editing]] ([[Soviet montage theory|montage]]) effect demonstrated by Soviet film-maker [[Lev Kuleshov]] in the 1910s and 1920s. It is a mental phenomenon by which viewers derive more meaning from the interaction of two sequential shots than from a single shot in isolation.

==Specifics==
[[File:KuleshovEffectExample.ogv|thumb|Example of a Kuleshov sequence, with the last shot changed]]
Kuleshov edited a short film in which a shot of the expressionless face of Tsarist matinee idol [[Ivan Mosjoukine]] was alternated with various other shots (a plate of soup, a girl in a coffin, a woman on a divan).  The film was shown to an audience who believed that the expression on Mosjoukine's face was different each time he appeared, depending on whether he was "looking at" the plate of soup, the girl in the coffin, or the woman on the divan, showing an expression of hunger, grief or desire, respectively. The footage of Mosjoukine was actually the same shot each time. [[Vsevolod Pudovkin]] (who later claimed to have been the co-creator of the experiment) described in 1929 how the audience "raved about the acting... the heavy pensiveness of his mood over the forgotten soup, were touched and moved by the deep sorrow with which he looked on the dead child, and noted the lust with which he observed the woman. But we knew that in all three cases the face was exactly the same."&lt;ref&gt;Pudovkin, "Naturshchik vmesto aktera", in ''Sobranie sochinenii'', Volume I, Moscow: 1974, p. 184.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kuleshov used the experiment to indicate the usefulness and effectiveness of film editing. The implication is that viewers brought their own emotional reactions to this sequence of images, and then moreover attributed those reactions to the actor, investing his impassive face with their own feelings. Kuleshov believed this, along with montage, had to be the basis of cinema as an independent art form.&lt;ref&gt;Russel, "The Kuleshov Effect and the Death of the Auteurism", in "Forum"&lt;/ref&gt;

The effect has also been studied by [[psychologist]]s, and is well-known among modern film-makers.  [[Alfred Hitchcock]] refers to the effect in his conversations with [[François Truffaut]], using actor [[James Stewart]] as the example.&lt;ref &gt;{{cite book|author= Thomas Leitch, Leland Poague|title= A Companion to Alfred Hitchcock|url=https://books.google.fr/books?id=ePMxuoC5kTYC&amp;pg=PA60&amp;lpg=PA60&amp;dq=Hitchcock+Kuleshov+principle+Truffaut&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=CIo_YBZL6L&amp;sig=ZjjJS9Z8Tqf1iSdWSoBkAakA4JY&amp;hl=fr&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwi6hcjh8aXdAhUrAcAKHSuQDSQQ6AEwB3oECAEQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Hitchcock%20Kuleshov%20principle%20Truffaut&amp;f=false|page=60|year= 2011|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-1-444-397314}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Truffaut, Francois, ''Hitchcock Truffaut'', New York: 1983, Chapter 11, p. 216.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hitchcock, in the famous "Definition of Happiness" interview, also explains in detail many types of editing.{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}} The final form, which he calls "pure editing", is explained visually using the Kuleshov effect. In the first version of the example, Hitchcock is squinting, and the audience sees footage of a woman with a baby. The screen then returns to Hitchcock's face, now smiling. In effect, he is a kind old man. In the second example, the woman and baby are replaced with a woman in a bikini, Hitchcock explains: "What is he now? He's a dirty old man."

The experiment itself was created by assembling fragments of pre-existing film from the Tsarist film industry, with no new material.  Mosjoukine had been the leading romantic "star" of Tsarist cinema, and familiar to the audience.

Kuleshov demonstrated the necessity of considering [[Montage (filmmaking)|montage]] as the basic tool of cinema art.  In Kuleshov's view, the cinema consists of fragments and the assembly of those fragments, the assembly of elements which in reality are distinct. It is therefore not the content of the images in a film which is important, but their combination.  The raw materials of such an art work need not be original, but are pre-fabricated elements which can be disassembled and re-assembled by the artist into new juxtapositions.

The montage experiments carried out by Kuleshov in the late 1910s and early 1920s formed the theoretical basis of Soviet montage cinema, culminating in the famous films of the late 1920s by directors such as [[Sergei Eisenstein]], [[Vsevolod Pudovkin]] and [[Dziga Vertov]], among others. These films included ''[[The Battleship Potemkin]]'', ''[[October: Ten Days That Shook the World|October]]'', ''[[Mother (1926 film)|Mother]]'', ''[[The End of St. Petersburg]]'', and ''[[The Man with a Movie Camera]]''.

==Research==
The Kuleshov effect has only been studied by psychologists in recent years. Prince and Hensley (1992) recreated the original study design but did not find the alleged effect. The study had 137 participants but was a single-trial between-subject experiment, which is prone to noise in the data.&lt;ref&gt;Prince, S., &amp; Hensley, W.E. (1992). "The Kuleshov effect: Recreating the classic experiment". ''Cinema Journal'', 31, 59–75.&lt;/ref&gt; Mobbs et al. (2006) did a within-subject fMRI study and found an effect for negative, positive, or neutral valence. When a neutral face was shown behind a sad scene, it seemed sad, when it was shown behind a happy scene it seemed happy.&lt;ref&gt;Mobbs, D., Weiskopf, N., Lau, H., Featherstone, E., Dolan, R., &amp; Frith, C. (2006). "The Kuleshov Effect: The influence of contextual framing on emotional attributions". ''Social Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience'', 1, 95–106.&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, Barratt, Rédei, Innes-Ker, and van de Weijer (2016) tested 36 participants using 24 film sequences across five emotional conditions (happiness, sadness, hunger, fear, and desire) and a neutral control condition. Again, they were able to show that neutral faces were rated in accordance with the stimuli material, confirming Mobbs et al. (2006) findings.&lt;ref&gt;Barratt, D., Rédei, A.C., Innes-Ker, A., &amp; van de Weijer, J. (2016). "Does the Kuleshov effect really exist? Revisiting a classic film experiment on facial expressions and emotional contexts". ''Perception'', 45, 847–874.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Thus, despite the initial problems in testing the Kuleshov effect experimentally, researchers now agree that the context in which a face is shown has a significant effect on how the face is perceived.

To find out whether the Kuleshov effect can also be induced auditorily, Baranowski and Hecht intercut different clips of faces with neutral scenes, featuring either happy music, sad music, or no music at all. They found that the music significantly influenced participants’ emotional judgments of facial expression.&lt;ref&gt;Baranowski, A.M., &amp; Hecht, H. (2016). "The auditory Kuleshov effect: Multisensory integration in movie editing". ''Perception'', 0(0), 1–8&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8199">The '''legal system of [[Azerbaijan]]''' is based on [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/aj.html Azerbaijan], [[CIA World Factbook]]&lt;/ref&gt; As the country was a [[Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic|republic]] of the [[Soviet Union]] until 1991, its legal history has also been influenced heavily by [[socialist law]]. However, after the collapse of the [[Soviet Union]], Azerbaijan became independent by enactment of the constitutional act of national independence on October 18, 1991. 
&lt;ref name="judicialcouncil.gov.az"&gt;http://www.judicialcouncil.gov.az/Meqaleler/Fikrat_Mammadov_e11.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Azerbaijan started reformation of the legal system by the establishing of democratic reforms. This was followed by the adoption of the first [[Constitution of Azerbaijan|Constitution]] in 1995 which is the foundation of the legislative system of the modern country.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nyulawglobal.org/globalex/Azerbaijan.html#_1._The_Legal_System%20of%20the%20Republic&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Constitution of Azerbaijan|Constitution]] creates the system of presidential republic with a [[separation of powers]] among the Legislative, Executive and Judicial branches of the government in order to prevent abuse of power.&lt;ref&gt;ghttp://azerbaijan.az/portal/General/Constitution/doc/constitution_e.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Civil law==
The term civil law in Azerbaijan refers to [[private law]], which is opposed to the [[common law]] system of [[Criminal law]] and [[Civil law (common law)|Civil law]]. The major body of statutes and laws governing civil law and procedure are set out in the Civil Code of Azerbaijan, established in December 1999.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.azpromo.az/uploads/legislation/Civil_code_eng_51b1e34e863c1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criminal law==
The current Criminal Code of Azerbaijan came into force in September 2000, replacing the older Criminal Code of 1960 which had been based on the principles of [[Soviet law]].&lt;ref name="llex1"&gt;[http://www.llrx.com/features/azerbaijan.htm#legislative%20system The Basic Structure of the Azerbaijan Legislative System]&lt;/ref&gt; Article 1 of the Criminal Code states that "the Criminal legislation of the Republic of Azerbaijan consists of this Code. New laws defining criminal responsibility are subject to inclusion in this Code";&lt;ref name="llex1"/&gt; this is characteristic of [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] legal systems such as [[France]] and [[Italy]]. In 1998 Azerbaijan was the first country in the Orient to abolish the [[capital punishment]].&lt;ref name="judicialcouncil.gov.az"/&gt;

==Sources of law==
Unlike [[common law]] systems such as the [[United States]] and [[United Kingdom]], Azerbaijani courts do not rely extensively on [[case law]] and judicial [[precedent]]. Except for decisions of the [[Constitutional Court]] of Azerbaijan, decisions of the courts are not usually counted as a source of law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.llrx.com/features/azerbaijan.htm#case%20law Case Law in Azerbaijan]&lt;/ref&gt; The sources of law in the Azerbaijani legal system are:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.llrx.com/features/azerbaijan.htm#sources%20of%20law Sources of Azerbaijani law]&lt;/ref&gt;
*The [[Constitution of Azerbaijan]].
*Acts adopted via [[referendum]].
*[[Laws]] passed by the [[National Assembly of Azerbaijan]], Azerbaijan's [[legislature]].
*[[Decree]]s.
*Resolutions of the [[Cabinet of Ministers]].
*International [[treaties]] to which Azerbaijan is a party.

==Court system==
The [[Supreme court|Supreme Court]] of Azerbaijan is a supreme judicial body on civil, criminal and other cases related to the execution of general and specialized courts. The [[Constitutional Court of Azerbaijan]] is the supreme body of constitutional justice on the matters attributed to its jurisdiction by the Constitution, with authority to interpret and apply the [[Constitution of Azerbaijan]].

The 1995 constitution provides for public trials in most cases, the presumption of innocence in criminal cases, and a defendant’s right to legal counsel. Both defendants and prosecutors have the right of appeal. In practice, however, the courts are politically oriented, seeming to overlook the government’s human rights violations. In July 1993, [[Heydar Aliyev]] ousted the Supreme Court chief justice because of alleged political loyalties to the opposition. The president directly appoints lower level judges. The president also appoints the Constitutional Court and Supreme Court judges with confirmation by the legislature. Prosecutors (procurators) are appointed by the president with confirmation by the legislature. The [[minister of justice]] organizes prosecutors into offices at the district, municipal, and republic levels. The constitution provides equal status for prosecutors and defense attorneys before the courts, but in practice the arrest and investigatory powers of the prosecutors have dominant influence before the courts. Judges will often remand a case for further prosecutory investigation rather than render an innocent verdict. Investigations often rely on obtaining confessions rather than on gathering evidence.

The Azerbaijan [[Government of Azerbaijan|government’s]] [[human rights]] record is poor, although some public policy debate is allowed and human rights organizations operate. The government restricts freedom of assembly, religion, and association. Numerous cases of arbitrary arrest, beatings (some resulting in deaths), unwarranted searches and seizures, and other human rights abuses are reported. Political oppositionists are harassed and arrested, and there are dozens of political prisoners in Azerbaijan. The conflict between  [[Armenia]]ns and Azerbaijanis contributed to widespread human rights violations by both sides. Some opposition newspapers are allowed to exist.

== Legal Reforms ==
{{Main|Legal reform in Azerbaijan}}
After gaining of independence Azerbaijani legal system has undergone fundamental reforms. An important part of the legal reforms in the country is related to adoption of a new Constitution in Azerbaijan in 1995. Since that Constitution was amended three times in 2002, 2009 and 2016.  Adoption of the Constitution has been followed by reforms related to progressive legislative acts such as, "The Law on Constitutional court", "The Law on Courts and Judges", "The Law on Police", "The Law on Operational-investigational activity", Law Judicial Legal Council, Criminal and Civil Procedure Codes and etc. Moreover, there have been made a number of amendements to the Civil Code, the Code of Civil Procedure, the Criminal Code, the Code of Criminal Procedure, etc.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.judicialcouncil.gov.az/e_mehkeme_ve_huquq.php&lt;/ref&gt;

Legal reforms introduced new three stage - first instance, appelate and supreme court system in Azerbaijan and ensured its independence from other branches of power. At present, there are district (city) courts acts as the first degree of jurisdictional courts, military courts and local administrative-economic courts as territorial jurisdictional courts, also Court of Azerbaijan Republic on Felonies and Court of Azerbaijan on Grave Military Crimes.

The Supreme Court of Azerbaijan Republic is cassation degree of jurisdiction and consists of 4 chambers - Civil Chamber, Criminal Chamber, Military Chamber and Administrative-Economic Chamber. Court hearings are public, and defendants are free to choose their own attorney and have the right to appeal the verdict. In cases involving national security or other defined by law a judge may decide to hold a closed trial.

Azerbaijan as a member of the Council of Europe ratificated [[European Convention on Human Rights]] . Further, Azerbaijani ''individuals, group of individuals and non-governmental organisations'' can refer cases to the ECHR.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4104">The [[BBC]]'s '''Lonclass''' ("London Classification") is a subject classification system used internally at the BBC throughout its [[BBC Archives|archives]].&lt;ref name="vardan"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Vardan|first=Vijaylakshmi|title=Book Review : A Handbook for Media Librarians|journal=Library Management|year=2008|volume=29|issue=8/9|pages=814–819|issn=0143-5124}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lonclass is derived from the [[Universal Decimal Classification]] (UDC), itself a reworking of the earlier [[Dewey Decimal Classification]] (DDC). Lonclass dates from the 1960s,&lt;ref name="vardan" /&gt; whereas UDC was created from DDC in the late 19th century. The BBC adaptation of UDC preserves the core features that distinguish UDC from DDC: an emphasis on a compositional semantics that allows new items to be expressed in terms of relationships between known items.

Lonclass and UDC (like DDC) are expressed using codes based on decimal numbers. Unlike DDC, the Lonclass and UDC codes use additional punctuation to express patterns of relationships and re-usable qualifiers. While Lonclass makes a few structural adjustments to the UDC system to support its emphasis on TV and radio content, its main distinction is in the actual set of topics that are recorded within its authority file and within specific BBC catalogue records. Unlike UDC and DDC, which are widely used across the library community, Lonclass has remained a BBC-internal system since its creation in the 1960s.&lt;ref name="vardan" /&gt;
There are 300,000 subject terms in the Lonclass vocabulary.&lt;ref&gt;Dowman, M.; V. Tablan, H. Cunningham, C. Ursu, and
B. Popov. (2005). "Semantically Enhanced Television News through Web and Video Integration." In ''Second European Semantic Web Conference (ESWC’2005)''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==

For example, a Lonclass or UDC code may represent “Report on the environmental impact of the decline of tin mining in Sweden in the 20th century“. This would be represented as a sequence of numbers and punctuation. The complex code can be broken down into primitives such as "Sweden" or "tin mining" (which itself could be broken down to "Tin" and "Mining").

Some specific BBC Lonclass examples (with explanatory labels):

The '''Mixed Reality Simulation Platform (MIXR)''' is an open-source software project designed to support the development of robust, scalable, virtual and constructive, and stand-alone and distributed simulation applications. Its most common use case is to support the development of executable simulation applications used to assemble real-time, interactive, distributed virtual environments (DVEs).

==Abbreviated History==

The genesis of MIXR software codebase can be traced to the late 1980s when it was written in the C programming language and executed on a Commodore Amiga 1000.  Because C doesn't directly support the object-oriented (OO) programming paradigm, the codebase defined an OO-like infrastructure to support programming from this perspective.  In the early 1990's, the C-based OO system was converted to C++, where applications were developed and executed on Silicon Graphics (i.e., SGI) workstations.  The transition away from Silicon Graphics workstations to personal computers (PCs) occurred in 1997.

Initially, the codebase had no official name associated with it; that changed in 2002 when it was named the Enhanced Air-to-Air, Air-to-Ground Linked Environment Simulation (EAAGLES); later updated to mean the Extensible Architecture for the Analysis and Generation of Linked Simulations.  The update removed domain-specific terminology such as "air-to-air" and "air-to-ground" to emphasize the more general purpose modeling and simulation capabilities the software is designed to support.

In 2003, EAAGLES became more visible within the DoD community when an EAAGLES-based fighter cockpit application was demonstrated at the Interservice/ Industry Training, Simulation and Education Conference (I/ITSEC); the world's largest modeling, simulation, and training conference. Even though the fighter cockpit simulator was developed in only a few months, it performed flawlessly; a testament to both the design of the application and the underlying framework.

In July of 2006, a significant subset of the original EAAGLES codebase was released into the public domain; it became what is known as {{Smallcaps|OpenEaagles}}. At the same time, a website was set up to provide information, documentation, and releases.  In 2009, the book "Design &amp; Implementation of Virtual and Constructive Simulations Using {{Smallcaps|OpenEaagles}}" was published. Since then, a steady stream of releases has been posted.

In 2017, the previously named {{Smallcaps|OpenEaagles}} project was renamed to MIXR for a number of reasons. These include:
* providing a better alignment of the project name with domain of interest; i.e., the development of mixed reality simulation applications,
* explicitly shifting away from using the term ''framework'' in favor of ''platform'' to indicate a concerted effort to expose the functionality/capability it provides in different ways, as opposed to traditional object-oriented inheritance (i.e., subclassing),
* serve as an indication that the project is transitioning away from a ''traditional C++'' codebase in favor of a ''modern C++'' codebase to improve quality, capability, understandably, and reduce complexity.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6560">A '''modeling perspective''' in [[information system]]s is a particular way to represent pre-selected aspects of a system. Any [[Perspective (cognitive)|perspective]] has a different focus, conceptualization, dedication and visualization of what the [[scientific modelling|model]] is representing. 

The traditional way to distinguish between modeling perspectives is structural, functional and behavioral/processual perspectives. This together with rule, object, communication and actor and role perspectives is one way of classifying modeling approaches.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Krogstie]] (2003). [http://www.idi.ntnu.no/~krogstie/publications/2003/quality-book/b2-languages.pdf Conceptual modeling] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070316203713/http://www.idi.ntnu.no/~krogstie/publications/2003/quality-book/b2-languages.pdf |date=2007-03-16 }}, &lt;/ref&gt;

== Types of perspectives ==
===Structural modeling perspective===
This approach concentrates on describing the static structure. The main concept in this modeling perspective is the entity, this could be an object, phenomena, concept, thing etc. 

The data modeling languages have traditionally handled this perspective, examples of such being:	
*The [[ER model|ER-language]] (Entity-Relationship)
*[[Generic Semantic Modeling language]] (GSM)
*Other approaches including:
:*The NIAM language (Binary relationship language)
:*[[Conceptual graph]]s ([[John Sowa|Sowa]])

Looking at the ER-language we have the basic components:
*Entities:	Distinctively identifiable phenomenon.
*Relationships:	An association among the entities. 
*Attributes:	Used to give value to a property of an entity/relationship.

Looking at the generic semantic modeling language we have the basic components:
*Constructed types built by abstraction: Aggregation, generalization, and association.
*Attributes.
*Primitive types: Data types in GSM are classified into printable and abstract types.
:*Printable: Used to specify visible values.
:*Abstract: Representing entities.

===Functional modeling perspective===
The [[functional model]]ing approach concentrates on describing the dynamic process. The main concept in this modeling perspective is the process, this could be a function, transformation, activity, action, task etc. A well-known example of a modeling language employing this perspective is data flow diagrams.

The perspective uses four symbols to describe a process, these being:
*Process: Illustrates transformation from input to output.
*Store:	   Data-collection or some sort of material.
*Flow:	   Movement of data or material in the process.
*External Entity: External to the modeled system, but interacts with it.

Now, with these symbols, a process can be represented as a network of these symbols.
This decomposed process is a DFD, data flow diagram.

===Behavioral perspective===
Behavioral perspective gives a description of system dynamics. The main concepts in behavioral perspective are states and transitions between states. State transitions are triggered by events. State Transition Diagrams (STD/STM), State charts and Petri-nets are some examples of well-known behaviorally oriented modeling languages. Different types of State Transition Diagrams are used particularly within [[real-time systems]] and [[telecommunications]] systems.

===Rule perspective===
Rule perspective gives a description of goals/means connections. The main concepts in rule perspective are rule, goal and constraint. A rule is something that influences the actions of a set of actors. The standard form of rule is “IF condition THEN action/expression”. Rule hierarchies (goal-oriented modeling), Tempora and Expert systems are some examples of rule oriented modeling.

===Object perspective===
The [[object-oriented]] perspective describes the world as autonomous, communicating objects. An object is an “entity” which has a unique and unchangeable identifier and a local state consisting of a collection of attributes with assignable values. The state can only be manipulated with a set of methods defined on the object. The value of the state can only be accessed by sending a message to the object to call on one of its methods. An event is when an operation is being triggered by receiving a message, and the trace of the events during the existence of the object is called the object’s life cycle or the process of an object. Several objects that share the same definitions of attributes and operations can be parts of an object class. The perspective is originally based on design and programming of object oriented systems. [[Unified Modelling Language]] (UML) is a well known language for modeling with an object perspective.

===Communication perspective===
This perspective is based on language/action theory from [[philosophical linguistics]]. The basic assumption in this perspective is that person/objects cooperate on a process/action through communication within them.

An illocutionary act consists of five elements: Speaker, hearer, time, location and circumstances. It is a reason and goal for the communication, where the participations in a communication act is oriented towards mutual agreement. In a communication act, the speaker generally can raise three claims: truth (referring an object), justice (referring a social world of the participations) and claim to sincerity (referring the subjective world of the speaker).

===Actor and role perspective===
[[Actor]] and [[role]] perspective is a description of organisational and system structure. An actor can be defined as a phenomenon that influences the history of another actor, whereas a role can be defined as the behaviour which is expected by an actor, amongst other actors, when filling the role. Modeling within these perspectives is based both on work with [[object-oriented programming language]]s and work with intelligent agents in [[artificial intelligence]]. [[I*]] is an example of an actor oriented language.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3352">"'''Nature Farming'''" was established in 1936 by [[Mokichi Okada]], the founder of the [[Church of World Messianity]], an agricultural system originally called "no fertilizer farming" or {{nihongo|[[:ja:自然農法|自然農法]]|shizen nōhō}} in Japanese.&lt;ref&gt;Sustainable Agriculture: Definition and Terms. Special Reference Briefs Series no. SRB 99-02, September 1999. Compiled by: Mary V. Gold, Alternative Farming Systems Information Center, U.S. Department of Agriculture&lt;/ref&gt;

Offshoots such as the Sekai Kyusei Kyo, promoting ‘Kyusei nature farming’, and the Mokichi Okada Association formed after his death to continue promoting the work in Japan and South-East Asia.&lt;ref&gt;Setboonsarng, S. and Gilman, J. 1999. Alternative Agriculture in Thailand and Japan. HORIZON Communications, Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut.&lt;/ref&gt;

ZZ2, a farming conglomerate in South Africa has translated the term to [[Afrikaans]], "Natuurboerdery".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite thesis|last=Silent|first=Taurayi,|title=An investigation of natuurboerdery (natural farming) approach : a ZZ2 case study|date=March 2011|publisher=Stellenbosch : University of Stellenbosch|url=http://scholar.sun.ac.za/handle/10019.1/6694|language=en-ZA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the International Nature Farming Research Center in [[Nagano Prefecture|Nagano]], Japan,&lt;ref&gt;Scientific Proof of Mokichi Okada's Nature Farming Theories by Xu, Hui-lian. Agricultural Experiment Station, International Nature Farming Research Center, Nagano&lt;/ref&gt; it is based on the theories that:
* [[Fertilizer]]s pollute the soil and weaken its power of production.
* [[Pest (organism)|Pests]] would break out from the excessive use of fertilizers
* The difference in disease incidence between resistant and susceptible plants is attributed to nutritional conditions inside the body.
* Vegetables and fruits produced by nature farming taste better than those by [[Industrial agriculture|chemical farming]].
The term is sometimes used for an alternative farming philosophy of [[Masanobu Fukuoka]].

==Natural Farming==
{{Main|Natural Farming}}
Another Japanese farmer and philosopher, [[Masanobu Fukuoka]], conceived of an alternative farming system in the 1930s separately from Okada and used the same Japanese characters to describe it.&lt;ref name="NATURE FARMING-Xu1"&gt;{{cite book|last=Xu|first=Hui-Lian|title=NATURE FARMING In Japan|url=http://www.ressign.com/UserBookDetail.aspx?bkid=460&amp;catid=140|accessdate=6 March 2011|type=Monograph|year=2001|publisher=Research Signpost|location=T.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1865">In [[statistics]], a '''probability plot''' is a [[graphical technique]] for comparing two data sets, either two sets of empirical observations, one empirical set against a theoretical set, or (more rarely) two theoretical sets against each other. It commonly means one of:

* [[P–P plot]], "Probability-Probability" or "Percent-Percent" plot;
* [[Q–Q plot]], "Quantile-Quantile" plot, which is more commonly used.&lt;ref name="thode"&gt;{{Harv|Thode|2002|loc=Section 2.2, Methods of Probability Plotting, [https://books.google.com/books?id=gbegXB4SdosC&amp;pg=PA31#PPA18,M1 p. 18]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Gibbons|Chakraborti|2003|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=kJbVO2G6VicC&amp;pg=PA144#PPA145,M1 p. 145]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Special cases include the

In [[Dzogchen]] teaching, '''rigpa''' ({{bo|t=རིག་པ་|w=rig pa}}; Skt. [[Vidya (Knowledge)|vidyā]]; "knowledge") is the knowledge of the [[Ground (Dzogchen)|ground]].{{refn|group=note|''ghzi''; Skrt.

''Rigpa'' is the knowledge of the [[Ground (Dzogchen)|ground]].{{refn|group=note|''ghzi''; Skrt. ''ālaya''{{sfn|Schaik|2004|p=5}}}} [[Erik Pema Kunsang]] translates a text which provides basic definitions of rigpa and marigpa in a Dzogchen context:
{{quote|Unknowing (marigpa) is not knowing the nature of mind. Knowing (rigpa) is the knowing of the original wakefulness that is personal experience.{{sfn|Kunsang|2006|p=Chapter 15}}}}
In Dzogchen, a fundamental point of practice is to distinguish rigpa from sems (''[[citta]]'', (grasping) mind).{{sfn|Kunsang|2012|p=154}}

Rigpa has two aspects, namely ''kadag'' and ''lhun grub''.{{sfn|Dalai Lama|2004|p=32}} ''Kadag'' means "purity" or specifically "primordial purity".{{sfn|Rinpoche Dzogchen Ponlop|2003}}{{sfn|Dalai Lama|2004|p=30}} ''Lhun grub'' in Tibetan normally implies automatic, self-caused or spontaneous actions or processes.{{sfn|Hookham|1991|p=49-50}} As quality of ''rigpa'' it means "spontaneous presence"{{sfn|Rinpoche Dzogchen Ponlop|2003}}{{refn|group=note|name="lhun grub"|See also [http://rywiki.tsadra.org/index.php/lhun_grub rywiki, ''lhun grub'']}} It may also mean "having a self-contained origin", being primordially Existent, without an origin, self-existent.{{sfn|Hookham|1991|p=49-50}} This division is the Dzogchen-equivalent of the more common Mahayana wisdom and compassion division.{{sfn|Dalai Lama|2004|p=32}}

===Full measure of rigpa===
Citing Dodrupchen Jikme Tenpe Nyima, the 14th Dalai Lama states the full measure of rigpa occurs with the [http://www.rigpawiki.org/index.php?title=Four_visions third vision].{{sfn|Dalai Lama|2004|p=183-4}}

{{See also|Dzogchen#Main practice}}

Dzogchen practices aim to attain rigpa and integrate this into everyday life:
{{quote|The practical training of the Dzogchen path is traditionally, and most simply, described in terms of View, Meditation and Action. To see directly the Absolute state, the Ground of our being is the View; the way of stabilising that view, and making it an unbroken experience is Meditation; and integrating the View into our entire reality, and life, is what is meant by Action.&lt;ref&gt;Sogyal Rinpoche (1992), ''The Tibetan Book of Living and Dying'', p.151]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The [[Menngagde]] or 'Instruction Class' of Dzogchen teachings are divided into two parts: ''Trekchö'' and ''Tögal'' (thod rgal). Ron Garry:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2069">{{distinguish|text=Schwinger's variational principle, ''[[Schwinger variational principle]]''}}

The '''Schwinger's quantum action principle''' is a [[variational method|variational]] approach to [[quantum mechanics]] and [[quantum field theory]]. This theory was introduced by [[Julian Schwinger]]. In this approach, the '''quantum action''' is an operator. Although it is superficially different from the [[path integral formulation]] where the action is a classical function, the modern formulation of
the two formalisms are identical.

Suppose we have two states defined by the values of a [[complete set of commuting operators]] at two times. Let the early and late states be &lt;math&gt;| A \rang&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;| B \rang&lt;/math&gt;, respectively. Suppose that there is a parameter in the Lagrangian which can be varied, usually a source for a field. The main equation of '''Schwinger's quantum action principle''' is:

:&lt;math&gt; \delta \langle B|A\rangle = i \langle B| \delta S |A\rangle,\ &lt;/math&gt;

where the derivative is with respect to small changes in the parameter.

In the path integral formulation, the transition amplitude is represented by the sum
over all histories of &lt;math&gt;\exp(iS)&lt;/math&gt;, with appropriate [[boundary condition]]s representing the states &lt;math&gt;| A \rang&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;| B \rang&lt;/math&gt;. The infinitesimal change in the amplitude is clearly given by Schwinger's formula. Conversely, starting from Schwinger's formula, it is easy to show that the fields obey canonical commutation relations and the classical equations
of motion, and so have a path integral representation. Schwinger's formulation was most significant because it could treat fermionic anticommuting fields with the same formalism as bose fields, thus implicitly introducing differentiation and integration
with respect to anti-commuting coordinates.

{{essay|date=March 2012}}

A person’s '''second language''' or '''L2''' is a language that is not the [[native language]]/[[first language]]/L1 of the speaker, but is learned by the speaker after his/her native language (usually a [[foreign language]], see below). Additionally, a person’s second language can be explained as the second language in the country the speaker lives in and they may be both used in daily life. For example, [[Languages of Canada|Canada]] has two official languages (English and French) and some citizens speak and use both of them.&lt;br&gt;
A person’s dominant language, which is the language the speaker uses most or is most comfortable with, is not necessarily to be his/her first language. The second language can also be the dominant one. For example, the Canadian census defines first language for its purposes as "the first language learned in childhood and still spoken", recognizing that for some, the earliest language may be lost, a process known as [[language attrition]]. This can happen when young children move, with or without their family (because of [[immigration]] or [[international adoption]]), to a new language environment.&lt;br&gt;

==Second-language acquisition==
{{main|Second-language acquisition}}
{{Further|Theories of second-language acquisition}}
[[File:Spanish orthography.jpg|upright=1.35|right|thumb|[[Blackboard]] used in [[Class (education)|class]] at [[Harvard University|Harvard]] shows [[student]]s' efforts at placing the [[Diaeresis (diacritic)|diaeresis]] and [[acute accent]] [[diacritic]]s used in the [[Spanish orthography]].]]
The distinction between '''acquiring''' and '''learning''' was made by [[Stephen Krashen]] (1982) as part of his [[Monitor Theory]]. According to Krashen, the ''acquisition'' of a language is a '''natural''' process; whereas ''learning'' a language is a '''conscious''' one. In the former, the student needs to partake in natural communicative situations. In the latter, error correction is present, as is the study of grammatical rules isolated from natural language. Not all educators in second language agree to this distinction; however, the study of how a second language is ''learned/acquired'' is referred to as ''second-language acquisition'' (SLA).

Research in SLA "...focuses on the developing knowledge and use of a language by children and adults who already know at least one other language... [and] a knowledge of second-language acquisition may help educational policy makers set more realistic goals for programmes for both foreign language courses and the learning of the majority language by minority language children and adults." (Spada &amp; Lightbown, p.&amp;nbsp;115).

SLA has been influenced by both linguistic and [[psychology|psychological]] theories. One of the dominant linguistic theories hypothesizes that a ''device'' or ''module'' of sorts in the brain contains innate knowledge. Many psychological theories, on the other hand, hypothesize that [[Cognition#Cognition as social process|cognitive mechanisms]], responsible for much of human learning, process language.

Other dominant theories and points of research include 2nd language acquisition studies (which examine if L1 findings can be transferred to L2 learning), verbal behaviour (the view that constructed linguistic stimuli can create a desired speech response), morpheme studies, behaviourism, error analysis, stages and order of acquisition, structuralism (approach that looks at how the basic units of language relate to each other according to their common characteristics), 1st language acquisition studies, contrastive analysis (approach where languages were examined in terms of differences and similarities) and inter-language (which describes L2 learners’ language as a rule-governed, dynamic system) (Mitchell, Myles, 2004).  
  
These theories have all influenced second-language teaching and pedagogy. There are many different methods of second-language teaching, many of which stem directly from a particular theory. Common methods are the [[grammar-translation method]], the [[Direct method (education)|direct method]], the [[audio-lingual method]] (clearly influenced by audio-lingual research and the behaviourist approach), the [[Silent Way]], [[Suggestopedia]], [[community language learning]], the [[Total Physical Response method]], and the [[communicative approach]] (highly influenced by Krashen’s theories) (Doggett, 1994). Some of these approaches are more popular than others, and are viewed to be more effective. Most language teachers do not use one singular style, but will use a mix in their teaching. This provides a more balanced approach to teaching and helps students of a variety of learning styles succeed.

===Effect of age===
The defining difference between a first language (L1) and a second language (L2) is the age the person learned the language. For example, [[linguistics|linguist]] [[Eric Lenneberg]] used ''second language'' to mean [[language acquisition|a language consciously acquired]] or used by its speaker after puberty. In most cases, people never achieve the same level of fluency and comprehension in their second languages as in their first language. These views are closely associated with the [[critical period hypothesis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pratt|first=Mary|title=Arts of the Contact Zone|journal=Profession|year=1991|pages=33–40}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Beerten|first=Roeland |author2=Billiet, Jaak |author3=Bart Maddens|title=National Identity and Attitude Toward Foreigners in a Multinational State: A Replication|journal=International Society of Political Psychology|year=2003|volume=24|series=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jacob|first=Brian|title=Defining Culture in a Multicultural Environment: An Ethnography of Heritage High School|journal=American Journal of Education|date=Aug 1995|volume=103|series=4|pages=339–376|doi=10.1086/444107|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Scarcella|first=Robin |author2=Krashen, Stephen D. |author3=Michael A. Long |title=Age, Rate and Eventual Attainment in Second Language Acquisition|journal=TESOL Quarterly|date=Dec 1979|volume=13|issue=4|pages=573–582|doi=10.2307/3586451}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In acquiring an L2, Hyltenstam (1992) found that around the age of six or seven seemed to be a cut-off point for [[Multilingualism|bilinguals]] to achieve native-like proficiency. After that age, L2 learners could get ''near-native-like-ness'' but their language would, while consisting of few actual errors, have enough errors to set them apart from the L1 group. The inability of some subjects to achieve native-like proficiency must be seen in relation to the ''age of onset'' (AO). Later, Hyltenstam &amp; Abrahamsson (2003) modified their age cut-offs to argue that after childhood, in general, it becomes more and more difficult to acquire native-like-ness, but that there is no cut-off point in particular.&lt;br&gt;

As we are learning more and more about the brain, there is a hypothesis that when a child is going through puberty, that is the time that accents ''start''. Before a child goes through puberty, the chemical processes in the brain are more geared towards language and social communication. Whereas after puberty, the ability for learning a language without an accent has been rerouted to function in another area of the brain—most likely in the frontal lobe area promoting cognitive functions, or in the neural system of hormone allocated for reproduction and sexual organ growth.

As far as the relationship between age and eventual attainment in SLA is concerned, Krashen, Long, and Scarcella, say that people who encounter foreign language in early age, begin natural exposure to second languages and obtain better proficiency than those who learn the second language as an adult. However, when it comes to the relationship between age and rate [[Second-language acquisition|SLA]], “Adults proceed through early stages of syntactic and morphological development faster than children (where time and exposure are held constant)” ([[Stephen Krashen|Krashen]], Long, Scarcella 573). Also, “older children acquire faster than younger children do (again, in early stages of morphological and syntactic development where time and exposure are held constant)” (573). In other words, adults and older children are fast learners when it comes to the initial stage of foreign language education.

Gauthier and Genesee (2011) have done a research which mainly focuses on the second language acquisition of internationally adopted children and results show that early experiences of one language of children can affect their ability to acquire a second language, and usually children learn their second language slower and weaker even during the critical period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gauthier |first1=Karine |last2=Genesee |first2=Fred |title=Language Development in Internationally Adopted Children: A Special Case of Early Second Language Learning |journal=Child Development |date=March 2011 |volume=82 |issue=3 |pages=887-901 |url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1467-8624.2011.01578.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;

As for the fluency, it is better to do foreign language education at an early age, but being exposed to a foreign language since an early age causes a “weak identification” (Billiet, Maddens and Beerten 241). Such issue leads to a "double sense of national belonging," that makes one not sure of where he or she belongs to because according to Brian A. Jacob, multicultural education affects students' "relations, attitudes, and behaviors" (Jacob 364). And as children learn more and more foreign languages, children start to adapt, and get absorbed into the foreign culture that they “undertake to describe themselves in ways that engage with representations others have made” (Pratt 35). Due to such factors, learning foreign languages at an early age may incur one’s perspective of his or her native country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pratt|first=Mary|title=Arts of the Contact Zone|journal=Profession|year=1991|pages=33–40}}&lt;/ref&gt;
===Similarities and differences between learned and native proficiency===
====Speed====
Acquiring a second language can be a lifelong learning process for many. Despite persistent efforts, most learners of a second language will never become fully ''native-like'' in it, although with practice considerable fluency can be achieved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lang1234.info/2/category/accent/1.html|title=Good Accents|publisher=globe1234.com |accessdate=2013-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, children by around the age of 5 have more or less mastered their first language with the exception of [[vocabulary]] and a few [[Grammar|grammatical]] structures, and the process is relatively very fast because language is a very complex skill. Moreover, if children start to learn a second language when they are 7 years old or younger, they will also be fully fluent with their second language in a faster speed comparing to the speed of learning by adults who start to learn a second language later in their life. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Johnson |first1=Jacqueline |last2=Newport |first2=Elissa |title=Critical period effects in second language learning: The influence of maturational state on the acquisition of English as a second language |journal=Cognitive Psychology |date=January 1989 |volume=21 |issue=1 |pages=60-99 |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0010028589900030}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;

====Correction====
In the first language, children do not respond to systematic correction. Furthermore, children who have limited input still acquire the first language, which is a significant difference between input and output. Children are exposed to a language environment of errors and lack of correction but they end up having the capacity to figure out the grammatical rules. Error correction does not seem to have a direct influence on learning a second language. Instruction may affect the rate of learning, but the stages remain the same. Adolescents and adults who know the rule are faster than those who do not. &lt;br&gt;

In the learning of a second language the correction of errors remains a controversial topic with many differing schools of thought. Throughout the last century much advancement has been made in research on the correction of students’ errors. In the 1950s and 60s the viewpoint of the day was that all errors must be corrected at all costs. Little thought went to students’ feelings or self-esteem in regards to this constant correction (Russell, 2009).

In the 1970s Dulay and Burt’s studies showed that learners acquire grammar forms and structures in a pre-determined, inalterable order, and that teaching or correcting styles would not change this (Russell, 2009).

In this same decade Terrell (1977) did studies that showed that there were more factors to be considered in the classroom than the cognitive processing of the students (Russell, 2009). He contested that the affective side of students and their self-esteem were equally important to the teaching process (Russell, 2009).

A few years later in the 1980s, the strict grammar and corrective approach of the 1950s became obsolete. Researchers asserted that correction was often unnecessary and that instead of furthering students’ learning it was hindering them (Russell, 2009). The main concern at this time was relieving student stress and creating a warm environment for them. Stephen Krashen was a big proponent in this hands-off approach to error correction (Russell, 2009).

The 1990s brought back the familiar idea that explicit grammar instruction and error correction was indeed useful for the SLA process. At this time, more research started to be undertaken to determine exactly which kinds of corrections are the most useful for students. In 1998, Lyster concluded that “recasts” (when the teacher repeats a student’s incorrect utterance with the correct version) are not always the most useful because students do not notice the correction (Russell, 2009). His studies in 2002 showed that students learn better when teachers help students recognize and correct their own errors (Russell, 2009). Mackey, Gas and McDonough had similar findings in 2000 and attributed the success of this method to the student’s active participation in the corrective processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Russell|first1=Victoria|title=Corrective feedback, over a decade of research since Lyster and Ranta (1997): Where do we stand today?|journal=Electronic Journal of Foreign Language Teaching|date=2009|volume=6|issue=1|pages=21–31|url=https://varussellblog.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/russell_eflt_2009.pdf|accessdate=23 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Depth of knowledge====
According to [[Noam Chomsky]], children will bridge the gap between input and output by their innate grammar because the input (utterances they hear) is so poor but all children end up having complete knowledge of grammar. Chomsky calls it the [[Poverty of the stimulus|Poverty of Stimulus]]. And second language learners can do this by applying the rules they learn to the sentence-construction, for example. So learners in both their native and second language have knowledge that goes beyond what they have received, so that people can make correct utterances (phrases, sentences, questions, etc) that they have never learned or heard before.&lt;br&gt;

====Emotionality====
[[Bilingualism]] has been an advantage to today's world and being bilingual gives the opportunity to understand and communicate with people with different cultural backgrounds. However, a study done by Optiz and Degner in 2012 shows that sequential bilinguals (i.e. learn their L2 after L1) often relate themselves to the emotions more when they perceive these emotions by their first language/native language/L1, but feel less emotional when by their second language even though they know the meaning of words clearly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Opitz |first1=Bertram |last2=Degner |first2=Juliane |title=Emotionality in a second language: It's a matter of time |journal=Neuropsychologia |date=July 2012 |volume=50 |issue=8 |pages=1961-1967 |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0028393212001844}}&lt;/ref&gt; The emotional distinction between L1 and L2 indicates that the "effective valence" of words is processed less immediate in L2 because of the delayed vocabulary/lexical access to these two languages.&lt;br&gt;

====Success====
Success in language learning can be measured in two ways: likelihood and quality. First language learners ''will'' be successful in both measurements. It is inevitable that all people will learn a first language and with few exceptions, they will be fully successful. For second language learners, success is not guaranteed. For one, learners may become fossilized or ''stuck'' as it were with ungrammatical items. ([[Fossilization (linguistics)|Fossilization]] occurs when language errors become a permanent feature. See Canale &amp; Swain (1980), Johnson (1992), Selinker (1972), and Selinker and Lamendella (1978).) The difference between learners may be significant. As noted elsewhere, L2 learners rarely achieve complete ''native-like'' control of the second language. &lt;br&gt;
For L2 pronounciation, there are two principles that haven been put forth by Levis (2005).

Being successful in learning a second language can seem like a daunting task. Research has been done to look into why some students are more successful than others. Stern (1975), Rubin (1975) and Reiss (1985) are just a few of the researchers who have dedicated time to this subject. They have worked to determine what qualities make a "good language learner" (Mollica, Neussel, 1997). Some of their common findings are that a good language learner uses positive learning strategies, is an active learner who is constantly searching for meaning. Also a good language learner demonstrates a willingness to practice and use the language in real communication. He also monitors himself and his learning, has a strong drive to communicate, and has a good ear and good listening skills (Mollica, Neussel, 1997).&lt;br&gt;

Özgür and Griffiths have designed an experiment in 2013 about the relationship between different motivations and second language acquisition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Özgür |first1=Burcu |last2=Griffiths |first2=Carol |title=Second Language Motivation |journal=Procedia - Social and Behavioral Sciences |date=25 January 2013 |volume=70 |pages=1109-1114 |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877042813001663}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have looked at four types of motivations—intrinsic (inner feelings of learner), extrinsic (reward from outside), integrative (attitude towards learning), and instrumental (practical needs). According to the test results, the intrinsic part has been the main  motivation for these student who learn English as their second language. However, students report themselves being strongly instrumentally motivated. In conclusion, learning a second language and being successful depend on every individual.&lt;br&gt;

==Foreign language==
[[File:Ldl-wortschatz.jpg|thumb|A German student learning French. [[English language|English]] (1.5 billion learners), [[French language|French]] (82 million learners) and [[Chinese language|Chinese]] (30 million learners) are the three most commonly studied foreign languages.&lt;ref&gt;Rick Noack and Lazaro Gamio, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/worldviews/wp/2015/04/23/the-worlds-languages-in-7-maps-and-charts "The world’s languages, in 7 maps and charts"], ''[[The Washington Post]]'', 23 April 2015 (page visited on 9 June 2015).&lt;/ref&gt;]]
[[File:Spanish class.jpg|thumb|[[High school]] [[Spanish language|Spanish]] taught as a second [[language]] to a class of native [[English speakers]] at an [[United States|American]] [[private school]] in [[Massachusetts]].]]

In [[pedagogy]] and [[sociolinguistics]], a distinction is made between second language and foreign language, the latter is being learned for use in an area where that language is originally from another country and not spoken in the native country of the speakers. And in other words, foreign language is used from the perspective of countries; the second language is used from the perspective of individuals.

For example, arguably, [[English language|English]] in countries such as [[India]], [[Pakistan]], [[Bangladesh]], [[the Philippines]], the [[Nordic countries]] and the [[Netherlands]] can be considered a second language for many of its speakers, because they learn it young and use it regularly; indeed in [[southern Asia]] it is the [[official language]] of the courts, government and business. The same can be said for [[French language|French]] in [[Algeria]], [[Morocco]] and [[Tunisia]], although French is nominally not an official language in any of these [[Arabic-speaking countries]]. In practice, French is widely used in a variety of contexts in these countries, and public signs are normally printed in both Arabic and French. A similar phenomenon exists in [[post-Soviet states]] such as the [[Ukraine]], [[Uzbekistan]], [[Kyrgyzstan]] and [[Kazakhstan]], where [[Russian language|Russian]] can be considered a second language, and there are large [[Russophone]] communities there.

However, in [[China]] (with the exception perhaps of Hong Kong), English must be considered a foreign language due to the lack of opportunities for use, such as historical links, media, conversation between people, and similar vocabulary. Likewise, French would be considered a foreign language in [[Romania]] and [[Moldova]]. This is despite Romanian and French being [[Romance languages]] (unlike Chinese and English, which come from two different [[language families]]: [[Sino-Tibetan]] and [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]]). This is also despite Romania and Moldova being the only two countries in the world where Romanian is an official language at the national level, Romania's historical links to France, and both Romanian-speaking countries' membership in the [[Francophonie]].
== Benefits of Bilingualism ==
Psychological studies have found that speaking two or more languages is good for people's cognitive process and the differences between brains of bilinguals and single language speakers usually provides some mental benefits, according to an article on [[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]] in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Merritt |first1=Anne |title=Why learn a foreign language? Benefits of bilingualism |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/educationopinion/10126883/Why-learn-a-foreign-language-Benefits-of-bilingualism.html |website=The Telegraph |accessdate=19 Jun 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Including but not limited to these: &lt;br&gt;
'''Becoming smarter'''&lt;br&gt;
Speaking a second language improves the functions of the brain by thinking and using the different language systems.&lt;br&gt;
'''Building multitasking skills'''&lt;br&gt;
According to a study from the Pennsylvania State University, "juggling language can make better brains".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Juggling languages can build better brains |url=https://news.psu.edu/story/160653/2011/02/18/juggling-languages-can-build-better-brains |website=PennState |accessdate=February 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because multilingual people are usually good at switching between different language systems, they can be good multitaskers as well. &lt;br&gt;
'''Improving memory'''&lt;br&gt;
The vocabulary capacity for a high school graduate student is about 45000 words, according to Nagy and Anderson (1984)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Nagy |first1=William |last2=Anderson |first2=Richard |title=How Many Words are There in Printed School English? |journal=Reading Research Quarterly |date=Spring 1984 |volume=19 |issue=3 |pages=304-330 |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/747823.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and being a bilingual will double this number because learning a language involves memorizing rules and vocabulary.&lt;br&gt;

== Data for Further Information ==
==== Weber's Report ====
George H. J. Weber, a Swiss businessman and independent scholar, founder of the Andaman Association and creator of the encyclopedic andaman.org Web site, made a report in December 1997 about the number of secondary speakers of the world's leading languages.&lt;ref&gt;[http://faculty.ignatius.edu/turner/languages.htm The World's Most Widely Spoken Languages] (reference for entire table)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.andaman.org/BOOK/reprints/weber/rep-weber.htm The World's 10 most influential Languages] (reference for entire table)&lt;/ref&gt; Weber used the [[Fischer Weltalmanach]] of 1986 as his only source&lt;ref&gt;Fig 6. [number of secondary speakers] is based on a table given in the Fischer Weltalamanach {{sic}} 1986, p. 910. [http://www.andaman.org/BOOK/reprints/weber/rep-weber.htm Full article]&lt;/ref&gt; for the L2-speakers data, in preparing the data in the following table.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21157">In [[sociolinguistics]], a '''sociolect''' or '''social dialect''' is a [[Variety (linguistics)|variety of language]] (a [[register (sociolinguistics)|register]]) used by a socioeconomic class, a profession, an age group or other social group.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Wolfram |first=Walt |chapter=Social varieties of American English |title=Language in the USA: Themes for the Twenty-first Century |editor=E. Finegan and J.R. Rickford |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2004 |isbn=0-521-77747-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sociolects involve both passive acquisition of particular communicative practices through association with a local community, as well as active learning and choice among speech or writing forms to demonstrate [[Identification (psychology)|identification]] with particular groups.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Durrell.  Sociolect.  In: Sociolinguistics. An International Handbook of the Science of Language and Society. Edited by Ulrich Ammon, et al.  Walter de Gruyter, 2004, pp. 200–205&lt;/ref&gt;

Individuals who study sociolects are called sociolinguists. Sociolinguists study language variation. Sociolinguists define a sociolect by examining the social distribution of specific linguistic terms. For example, a sociolinguist would examine the use of the second person pronoun "you" for its use within the population. If one distinct social group used 'yous' as the plural form of the pronoun then this could indicate the existence of a sociolect. A sociolect is distinct from a [[dialect]] because [[social class]] rather than geographical subdivision substantiates the unique linguistic features.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Eifring |first=Halvor |chapter=7 Language and Variation |title=Linguistics for Students of Asian and African Languages|url=http://www.uio.no/studier/emner/hf/ikos/EXFAC03-AAS/h05/larestoff/linguistics/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
A sociolect, defined by Peter Trudgill, a leading sociolinguist and [[philosopher]], is "a variety or lect which is thought of as being related to its speakers' social background rather than geographical background".&lt;ref name=Trudgill&gt;Trudgill, Peter. A Glossary of Sociolinguistics. Oxford; New York: Oxford University Press, 2003. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|122}} This idea of sociolect began with the commencement of [[dialectology]], the study of different [[dialect]]s in relation to social society, which has been established in countries such as England for many years, but only recently has the field garnered more attention.&lt;ref name=Halliday&gt;Halliday, M. Language and Society. London;  New York: Continuum, 2007. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|26}} However, as opposed to a dialect, the basic concept of a sociolect is that a person speaks in accordance with their social group whether it is with regard to one's ethnicity, age, gender, etc. As William Labov once said, "the sociolinguistic view…is that we are programmed to learn to speak in ways that fit the general pattern of our communities".&lt;ref name=Labov&gt;Labov, William. Dialect Diversity in America : the Politics of Language Change. Charlottesville: University of Virginia Press, 2012. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|6}} Therefore, what we are surrounded with in unison with our environment determines how we speak; hence, our actions and associations.

==Distinguished from dialect==
The main distinction between a sociolect and a dialect, which are continually confused, is the settings in which it is created. A dialect's main identifier is geography: a certain region uses specific phonological, morphosyntactic or lexical rules.&lt;ref name=Trudgill/&gt;{{rp|35}} Asif Agha expands the concept by stating that "the case where the demographic dimension marked by speech are matters of geographic provenance along, such as speaker's birth locale, extended residence and the like".&lt;ref name=Agha&gt;Agha, Asif. Language and Social Relations. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2007. 135. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|135}} However, a sociolect's main identifier is a socioeconomic class, age, gender, and ethnicity in a certain speech community.

An example of a dialectal difference, based on region, is the use of the words soda or pop and coke in different parts of the United States. As Thomas E. Murray states, "coke is used generically by thousands of people, especially in the southern half of the country."&lt;ref&gt;Murray, Thomas E.. "From Trade Name to Generic: The Case of Coke." Trans. Array Names: A Journal of Onomastics. Maney Publishing, 1995. 165-86. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, pop is known to be a term that is used by many citizens in the northern half of the country.

An example of a sociolect difference, based on social grouping, is the [[zero copula]] in [[African American Vernacular English]]. It occurs in a specific ethnic group but in all areas of the United States.&lt;ref name=Labov/&gt;{{rp|48}} [[William Labov]] gives an example: "he here" instead of "he's here".&lt;ref name=Labov/&gt;{{rp|38}}

==Definitions==

'''[[Code switching]]''' is "the process whereby bilingual or bidialectal speakers switch back and forth between one language or dialect and another within the same conversation".&lt;ref name=Trudgill/&gt;{{rp|23}}

'''[[Diglossia]]''', associated with the American linguist [[Charles A. Ferguson]], which describes a sociolinguistic situation such as those that obtain in Arabic-speaking countries and in German-speaking Switzerland. In such a diglossic community, the prestigious standard of 'High'(or H) variety, which is linguistically related to but significantly different from the vernacular or 'Low' (or L) varieties, has no native speakers.&lt;ref name=Trudgill/&gt;{{rp|389}}

'''Domain''' is "different language, dialects, or styles are used in different social contexts".&lt;ref name=Trudgill/&gt;{{rp|41}}

'''Language attitudes''' are "social in origin, but that they may have important effects on language behavior, being involved in acts of identity, and on linguistic change."&lt;ref name=Trudgill/&gt;{{rp|73}}

'''[[Linguistic variable]]''' is "a linguistic unit…initially developed...in order to be able to handle linguistics variation. Variables may be lexical and grammatical, but are most often phonological". Example of British English (h) which is sometimes present and sometimes not.&lt;ref name=Trudgill/&gt;{{rp|83}}

'''[[Pragmatics]]''' is the meaning of a word in social context, while [[semantics]] has "purely linguistic meaning".&lt;ref name=Trudgill/&gt;{{rp|107}}

'''Register''' is "a language variety that is associated with a particular topic, subject, or activity...." Usually, it is defined by vocabulary, but has grammatical features as well.&lt;ref name=Trudgill/&gt;{{rp|110}}

== Examples ==

===Tamil caste system===

Example 1

The following is an example of the lexical distinction between the Mudaliyar and the Iyengar groups of the Tamil-speaking caste in India. The Iyengar group is part of the Brahmin caste which is scholarly and higher in the caste hierarchy than the non-Brahmin or Mudaliyar, caste.&lt;ref name=Agha/&gt;{{rp|136}} The Mudaliyars use many of the same words for things that are differentiated within the Iyengars' speech. For example, as you can see below, the difference between drinking water, water in general, and non-potable water is used by one word in the non-Brahmin caste and three separate words in the Brahmin caste.  Furthermore, Agha references how the use of different speech reflects a "departure from a group-internal norm".&lt;ref name=Agha/&gt;{{rp|139}} For example, if the non-Brahmin caste uses Brahmin terms in their mode of speech it is seen as self-raising, whereas if people within the Brahmin caste use non-Brahmin speech it is seen as pejoratives.&lt;ref name=Agha/&gt;{{rp|138}} Therefore, depending on which castes use certain words the pragmatics change. Hence, this speech system is determined by socioeconomic class and social context.

Example 2

In the following example, we see the difference between the national standard and the colloquial speech found in Norway where the phonology and pronunciation differ. As Agha states, "Some lexical contrasts are due to the phonological difference (e.g., R makes more consonantal and vocalic distinctions than B), while others are due to the morphological difference (e.g., difference in plural suffixes and certain verb inflections) between two varieties.&lt;ref name=Agha/&gt;{{rp|140}}

=== Diglossia ===

Example 3

The chart below gives an example of diglossia in Arab-speaking nations and where it is used. Diglossia is defined by Mesthrie as "[a] situation where two varieties of a language exist side by side".&lt;ref name=Mesthrie&gt;Mesthrie, Rajend. Introducing Sociolinguistics. 2nd ed. Philadelphia: John Benjamins Pub., 2009. 38. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; The Classical Arabic is known as [[Modern Standard Arabic|الفصحى, or al-fuṣḥā]], while the colloquial dialect depends on the country. For example, [[Levantine Arabic|شامي, or šāmi]], is spoken in Lebanon and parts of Syria. In many situations, there is a major lexical difference among words in the classical and colloquial speech, as well as pronunciation differences, such as a difference in short vowels, when the words are the same. Although a specific example of diglossia was not given, its social context is almost if not more important. For example, Halliday tells us that "in areas with Diglossia, the link between language and success is apparent as the higher, classical register is learned through formal education".&lt;ref name=Halliday/&gt;{{rp|175}}

===African American Vernacular English (AAVE)===

Example 4

Below is an example of the addition of the verbal -s not just on 3rd person singular verbs in the present tense like in SAE, but added onto infinitives, first-person present verbs, and 3rd person past perfect verbs.&lt;ref name=Labov/&gt;{{rp|49}}

# He can goes out.
# I don't know how to gets no girls.
# He'd knows that.

Further examples of the phenomenon in AAVE are provided below.

Below are examples of the lack of the possessive ending -s is usually absent in AAVE but contains a rule
As Labov shows states, "[the] use -s to indicate possession by a single noun or pronoun, but never between the possessor and the possessed."&lt;ref name=Labov/&gt;{{rp|49}}

"This is hers, This is mines, This is John's, but not in her book, my book, John book"&lt;ref name=Labov/&gt;{{rp|49}}

"Interview with Bryan A., seven years old, a struggling reader in a West Philadelphia elementary school: 
# If I don't get out my mom room, I get in trouble and when I don't get out my sister room she hit me.
# Bernicia penpal gave me one.
# That's what he did to my cousin Raymond dog at my cousin house.
# I was acting like I stole my sister food.
# At the museum, it was fun, we went in somebody heart."&lt;ref name=Labov/&gt;{{rp|49}}

==Effects==

===Code-switching===

Many times within communities that contain sociolects that separate groups linguistically it is necessary to have a process where the independent speech communities can communicate in the same register; even if the change is as simple as different pronunciation. Therefore, the act of codeswitching becomes essential. Codeswitching is defined as "the process whereby bilingual or bidialectal speakers switch back and forth between one language or dialect and another within the same conversation".&lt;ref name="Trudgill 1983"&gt;Trudgill, Peter. On Dialect : Social and Geographical Perspectives. New York: New York University Press, 1983. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|23}} At times codeswitching can be situational, depending on the situation or topical, depending on the topic. Halliday terms this the best when he defines the role of discourse stating that "it is this that determines, or rather correlates with, the role played by the language activity in the situation".&lt;ref name=Halliday/&gt;{{rp|20}} Therefore, meaning that which register is used depends on the situation and lays out the social context of the situation, because if the wrong register is used, then the wrong context is placed on the words. Furthermore, referring back to the diglossia expressed in the Arab-speaking world and the Tamil caste system in India, which words are used must be appropriate to not only the social class of the speaker, but the situation, the topic, and the need for courtesy. A more comprehensive definition is stated, "Code-switching is not only a definition of the situation but an expression of social hierarchy."&lt;ref name=Halliday/&gt;{{rp|137}}

For examples of the use of speech within certain situation refer back to the chart on Classical and Colloquial Arabic.

For examples of dialect selection based on topic, refer below:

When Albania was created in 1912, the educational rights of the Greek communities in Albanian territory were granted by the Protocol of Corfu (1914) and with the statement of Albania's representatives in the League of Nations (1921). However, under a policy of assimilation, the Greek schools (there were over 360 until 1913) were gradually forced to close and Greek education was virtually eliminated by 1934. Following the intervention by the League of Nations, a limited number of schools, only those inside the "official minority zones", were reopened.&lt;ref&gt;King, Russell; Mai, Nicola; Schwandner-Sievers, Stephanie (2005). The New Albanian Migration. Sussex Academic Press. {{ISBN|978-1-903900-78-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Greece of Tomorrow. George H. Chase. READ BOOKS, 2007. {{ISBN|1-4067-0758-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Ethnic Greeks living outside those areas were not counted as such. This has had a practical effect in the area of education: With the exception of the officially recognized Greek minority zones, where teaching was held in both the Greek and Albanian languages, in all other areas of Albania lessons were taught only in the Albanian language.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unhcr.org/refworldcountry,,,,ALB,4562d8b62,4938ef322,0.html Advisory Committee on the Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities: Second Opinion on Albania], 29 May 2008. Council of Europe: Secretariat of the Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities.&lt;/ref&gt;If a few Albanian families moved into a town or village, the minority's right to be educated in Greek and publish in Greek newspapers was revoked.&lt;ref&gt;Vance, Charles; Paik, Yongsun (2006). Managing a Global Workforce Challenges and Opportunities in International Human Resource Management. M.E. Sharpe. p. 682. {{ISBN|978-0-7656-2016-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;In accordance with the communist Albanian policy of unification and homogenization, the use of the Greek language in Himarë was forbidden in public, and many Greek-speaking people were forced to move to places in northern or central Albania.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bon|2008a|p=111}}.&lt;/ref&gt;As a consequence, Greek schools in the Himarë area were closed, and the local communities stuck to their language, which slowly became archaic when they started to emigrate to Greece (1991) in the aftermath of the communist regime's collapse.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bon|2008a|p=60}}; {{harvnb|Bon|2008b|pp=7–29}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

As Trudgill defines it, the Arvanikita is "the name given in Greece given to the language of the indigenous Albanian-speaking linguistic minority in that country".&lt;ref name="Trudgill 1983"/&gt;{{rp|10}} This community is different linguistically than the surrounding area and must use their language accordingly. For example, nowadays, Arvanitika is only used at home and other situations, such as in school during games, on the playground, or for "chatting up girls", while only Greek is spoken in class.&lt;ref name=Garrett&gt;Garrett, Peter. Investigating Language Attitudes: Social Meanings of Dialect, Ethnicity and Performance. Cardiff: University of Wales Press, 2003. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|129}} 

Therefore, it is both topical and situational in context.

===Discrimination===

Human rights in Albania are violated by the Government which have targeted the Greek-speaking population via police and secret service according to Human Rights organisations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/legacy/summaries/s.albania952.html|title=Albania: The Greek Minority|website=Hrw.org|accessdate=28 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;According to Amnesty International there were cases of mistreatment of members of the Greek-speaking minority by the authorities.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/eur11/004/1995/en/ ALBANIA: FAILURE TO END POLICE ILL-TREATMENT AND DEATHS IN CUSTODY]&lt;/ref&gt;Also, the Greek-speaking minority complained about the government’s unwillingness to recognize Greek-speaking towns outside communist-era “minority zones,” to utilize Greek in official documents and on public signs in Greek-speaking areas, or to include more ethnic Greeks in public administration.&lt;ref name="US_Department_of_State_2008"&gt;https://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/2008/eur/119064.htm ALBANIA 2008 HUMAN RIGHTS REPORT]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="US_Department_of_State_2009"&gt;https://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/2009/eur/136016.htm ALBANIA 2009 HUMAN RIGHTS REPORT]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="US_Department_of_State_2010"&gt;[https://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/2010/eur/154409.htm ALBANIA 2010 HUMAN RIGHTS REPORT]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="US_Department_of_State_2011"&gt;[https://al.usembassy.gov/wp-content/uploads/sites/140/2016/10/2011-Human-Rights-Report.pdf ALBANIA 2011 HUMAN RIGHTS REPORT]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="US_Department_of_State_2012"&gt;[https://al.usembassy.gov/wp-content/uploads/sites/140/2016/10/2012-Human-Rights-Report-Albania.pdf ALBANIA 2012 HUMAN RIGHTS REPORT]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="US_Department_of_State_2013"&gt;[https://al.usembassy.gov/wp-content/uploads/sites/140/2016/10/2013-Human-Rights-Report-Albania.pdf ALBANIA 2013 HUMAN RIGHTS REPORT]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="US_Department_of_State_2014"&gt;[https://al.usembassy.gov/wp-content/uploads/sites/140/2016/10/2014-Human-Rights-Report-Albania.pdf ALBANIA 2014 HUMAN RIGHTS REPORT]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="US_Department_of_State_2015"&gt;[https://www.state.gov/documents/organization/253027.pdf ALBANIA 2015 HUMAN RIGHTS REPORT]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="US_Department_of_State_2016"&gt;[https://www.state.gov/documents/organization/265600.pdf ALBANIA 2016 HUMAN RIGHTS REPORT]&lt;/ref&gt;
Albanian sources often use the pejorative term 'filogrek' (pro-Greek) in relation to Greeks-speaking minority groups, usually in a context disputing their Greek ancestry.&lt;ref&gt;King, Russell; Mai, Nicola; Schwandner-Sievers, Stephanie (2005). 
The New Albanian Migration. Sussex Academic Press. {{ISBN|978-1-903900-78-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;The 2012 USA annual report mention that the emergence of strident nationalist groups like the [[Red and Black Alliance]] (RBA) increased ethnic tensions with the Greek-speaking minority groups.&lt;ref name="US_Department_of_State_2012" /&gt;

The Arvanitika community also suffers from discrimination because they are cast under stereotypes by the use of their native language. As Garrett writes, "a number of Arvanites had suffered from what they regarded as discrimination, particularly during military service, and at school".&lt;ref name=Garrett/&gt;{{rp|130}} Even though, the language is the only thing that differentiates them from the surrounding Greeks, it still defines them as a distinct class and places them within a social hierarchy. 

Furthermore, within societies that maintain a diglossic state, the High ('H') and Low ('L') forms serve as a basis for discrimination. As Mesthrie writes, "Since the H form is learned via formal education, diglossia can be a means of excluding people from access to full participation in society".&lt;ref name=Mesthrie/&gt;

== Sociotropy-Autonomy Scale ==
The Sociotropy-Autonomy Scale (SAS) was introduced by [[Aaron T. Beck]] as a means of assessing two cognitive-personality constructs hypothesized as risk factors in depression. The scale focuses on the two personality traits of Sociotropy (social dependency) and Autonomy (satisfying independency). The development of the SAS was gathered through patient self-reports and patient records collected from therapists. Using psychometrics, from the sample of 378 psychiatric patients questions were placed into a two-factor structure where the final pool of items was 60-109.&lt;ref name="bieling-2000"&gt;{{cite |last1=Bieling |first1=Peter J. |last2=Beck |first2=Aaron T. |last3=Brown |first3=Gregory K. |year=2000 |title=The Sociotropy–Autonomy Scale:Structure and Implications |journal=Cognitive Therapy and Research |volume=24 |issue=6 |pages=763–780 |publisher=Kluwer Academic Publishers-Plenum Publishers |url=http://download.springer.com/static/pdf/194/art%253A10.1023%252FA%253A1005599714224.pdf?auth66=1397326819_0acc2242811435d4b75cd0911a704dca&amp;ext=.pdf |accessdate=9 April 2014 |doi=10.1023/A:1005599714224}}&lt;/ref&gt; From there each 30 items generated three factors for sociotropy: Concern About Disapproval, Attachment/Cocern About Separation, and Pleasing Others; and three for autonomy: Individualistic or Autonomous Achievement, Mobility/Freedom from Control of Others, and Preference for Solitude. The SAS has 60 items rated on a 5 point scale (ranging from 0 to 4). Scores are then totaled separately on each dimension. The scale has been modified since its development. The current SAS decomposes Sociotropy into two factors (''neediness'' and ''connectedness''). Neediness is associated with the symptoms of depression—and connectedness is a sensitivity towards others, and associated with valuing relationships.

Since the development of the SAS, many other measures of personality constructs have been developed to assess other personality traits with some overlapping with the SAS, but examining for different traits.

== Self-control ==
Sociotropic individuals react differently when faced with situations that involve [[self-control]].&lt;ref name="sato-2011" /&gt; Sociotropic individuals consume more food, or try to match a peer's eating habits when they believe doing so makes the peer more comfortable.&lt;ref name="exline-2012"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Exline |first1=Julie J. |last2=Zell |first2=Anne L. |last3=Bratslavsky |first3=Ellen |last4=Hamilton |first4=Michelle |last5=Swenson |first5=Anne |year=2012 |title=People-pleasing through eating:  Sociotropy predicts greater eating in response to perceived social pressure. |journal=Journal of Social and Clinical Psychology |volume=31 |issue=2 |pages=169–193 |doi=10.1521/jscp.2012.31.2.169}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is often hypothesized as being a result of the individual attempting to achieve social approval and avoid social rejection. The social pressure and dependence can cause a loss of self-control in an individual, especially if they are unaware of their desire for social acceptance.

== Depression ==
Much research on Sociotropy focuses on links between personality and the risk for depression. People who are very dependent are classified as sociotropic individuals, and are more prone to depression as they seek to sustain their low self-esteem by establishing secure [[interpersonal relationships]].&lt;ref name="coyne-1995"&gt;{{cite| |last1=Coyne |first1=James C. |last2=Whiffen |first2=Valerie E. |year=1995 |title=Issues in Personality as Diathesis for Depression: The Case of Sociotropy-Dependency and Autonomy-Self-Criticism |journal=Psychological Bulletin |volume=118 |issue=3 |pages=358–378 |publisher=US: American Psychological Association |url=http://psycnet.apa.org.lp.hscl.ufl.edu/journals/bul/118/3/358.pdf |accessdate=9 April 2014 |doi=10.1037/0033-2909.118.3.358}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sociotropic individuals are heavily invested into their relationships with other people and have higher desires for acceptance, support, understanding, and guidance—which is problematic when relationships fail. People who are sociotropic and going through failed relationships are likely to become depressed due to intensified feelings of abandonment and loss.  Researchers have a hard time figuring out exactly how much personality affects risk for depression, as it is hard to isolate traits for research, though they conclude that a person can either be sociotropic or independent, but not both.

== Research == 
Sociotropy has been linked to other personality traits such as [[introversion]] and lack of assertion. Lack of assertion has been hypothesized to be due to the need to please others to build interpersonal relationships. Individuals who are sociotropic avoid confrontation to prevent abandonment.&lt;ref name="sato-2006"&gt;{{cite| |last1=Sato |first1=Toru |last2=McCann |first2=Doug |year=2007 |title=Sociotropy–autonomy and interpersonal problems |journal=Depression and Anxiety |volume=24 |issue=3 |pages=153–162 |publisher=Wiley-LISS |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com.lp.hscl.ufl.edu/doi/10.1002/da.20230/pdf |accessdate=9 April 2014 |doi=10.1002/da.20230}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Along the lines of lack of assertion there has also been research studying the connection between sociotropy and shyness. The characteristic interpersonal dependence and fear of social rejection are also attributes of shyness. Research shows that many items from the SAS relate to dimensions of dependence and preoccupations for receiving approval of others, which is problematic in interpersonal relationships for people who are shy. Individuals who are shy and sociotropic have internal conflicts to want to avoid others as well as having strong motives to approach people.&lt;ref name="bruch-1999"&gt;{{cite| |last1=Bruch |first1=Monroe A |last2=Rivet |first2= Kathy M. |last3=Heimberg |first3=Richard G. |last4=Hunt |first4=Anne |last5=McIntosh |first5=Bonnie |year=1999 |title=Shyness and Sociotropy: Additive and Interactive Relations in Predicting Interpersonal Concerns |journal=Journal of Personality |volume=67 |issue=2 |pages=373–406 |publisher=Blackwell Publishers |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com.lp.hscl.ufl.edu/doi/10.1111/1467-6494.00059/pdf |accessdate=9 April 2014 |doi=10.1111/1467-6494.00059}}&lt;/ref&gt; The results from such research concludes that sociotropy predicts other symptoms of discomfort in assertive situations and in conversations.

Research on the subject also seems to connect a link between higher levels of anxiety and sociotropy. Putting excessive amounts of energy into dependent relationships increases anxiety. The behavioral disposition that causes an individual to depend on others for personal satisfaction can also have an effect on their anxiety levels.&lt;ref name="sato-2004" /&gt; The research concluded that anxiety and sociotropy are positively correlated in many situations such as Social Evaluation, Physical Danger, and Ambiguous Situations. Sociotropy and anxiety are present in these situations because they are social by definition, and therefore associated with emphasis on social relationships that are characteristic of sociotropic individuals.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4337">A '''top-lit updraft gasifier''' (also known as a '''TLUD''') is a [[micro-kiln]] used to produce charcoal, especially [[biochar]], and heat for cooking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Biochar-Producing Stoves to Benefit Climate, Health, and Soil|url=http://www.biochar-international.org/technology/stoves|publisher=International Biochar Initiative|accessdate=6 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A TLUD [[pyrolysis|pyrolyzes]] organic material, including wood or manure, and uses a reburner to eliminate volatile byproducts of pyrolization. The process leaves mostly [[carbon]] as a residue, which can be incorporated into soil to create [[terra preta]].

Dr Thomas B Reed and the Norwegian architect Paal Wendelbo independently developed the working idea of a TLUD gasifier in the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of TLUD|url=http://www.drtlud.com/tlud-technology/history/|publisher=Dr TLUD}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A TLUD gasifier takes it further from a [[rocket stove]] in more efficient way of smoke-free, highly efficient combustion of the fuel.

== The Technology ==

A TLUD gasifier stove &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BioChar Foundation|url=http://www.biochar-international.org/technology/stoves}}&lt;/ref&gt; is commonly constructed with two concentric cylindrical containers.

The inner cylinder is the fuel pot. The fuel pot has holes in the base. These holes are the primary air inlet. The fuel pot also has holes on the neck, like the skirt, serving as a secondary air inlet.

The outer cylinder has holes near the bottom on the sides. During combustion, air enters these holes, either by natural air draft or forced with a DC fan depending on requirement and construction model.

Any biomass with less than 20% water content can be used as fuel. The user fills the fuel pot up to the neck, just below the secondary air inlet holes. The user ignites the top layer of fuel for the pyrolysis to start. Air then flows in through the primary and secondary air inlets. The primary inlet helps the draft of pyrolysed wood gas flow up.

The secondary air inlet blows hot air by the time it travels around the fuel pot. The secondary inlet above the fuel layer helps burn the wood gas. 

YouTube has many instructional videos, with further explanation on other websites.

[[File:Webcam CT transmissions.OGG|thumb|225px|Animated set of X-ray images of a webcam. Images acquired using [[Industrial computed tomography scanning|industrial CT scanning]].]]
[[File:SumburghHead webcam.jpg|thumb|A webcam installed near [[Sumburgh Head]] lighthouse, ([[Shetland]])]]

A '''webcam''' is a [[video camera]] that feeds or [[Streaming media|streams]] its image in real time to or through a [[computer]] to a [[computer network]]. When "captured" by the computer, the video stream may be saved, viewed or sent on to other networks travelling through  systems such as the internet, and e-mailed as an attachment. When sent to a remote location, the video stream may be saved, viewed or on sent there. Unlike an [[IP camera]] (which connects using [[Ethernet]] or [[Wi-Fi]]), a webcam is generally connected by a [[USB]] cable, or similar cable, or built into computer hardware, such as laptops.

The term "webcam" (a [[clipped compound]]) may also be used in its original sense of a [[video camera]] connected to the [[World Wide Web|Web]] continuously for an indefinite time, rather than for a particular session, generally supplying a view for anyone who visits its [[web page]] over the Internet.  Some of them, for example, those used as online [[traffic camera]]s, are expensive, rugged [[professional video camera]]s.

== Characteristics ==
Webcams are known for their low [[manufacturing]] cost and their high flexibility,&lt;ref&gt;Solomon Negash, Michael E. Whitman. Editors: Solomon Negash, Michael E. Whitman, Amy B. Woszczynski, Ken Hoganson, Herbert Mattord. [https://books.google.com/books?id=Cz4aIXq5z8YC Handbook of Distance Learning for Real-Time and Asynchronous Information Technology Education], Idea Group Inc (IGI), 2008, p. 17, {{ISBN|1-59904-964-3}}, {{ISBN|978-1-59904-964-9}}. Note costing: "students had the option to install a webcam on their end (a basic webcam costs about $40.00) to view the class in session."&lt;/ref&gt; making them the lowest-cost form of [[videotelephony]]. Despite the low cost, the [[Image resolution|resolution]] offered at present (2015) is rather impressive, with low-end webcams offering resolutions of 320×240, medium webcams offering 640×480 resolution, and high-end webcams offering 1280×720 (aka [[720p]]) or even 1920×1080 (aka [[1080p]]) resolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ebay.com/gds/How-Much-Resolution-is-Enough-Picking-a-Webcam-/10000000177742678/g.html|title=How Much Resolution is Enough?

They have also become a source of security and privacy issues, as some built-in webcams can be remotely activated by [[spyware]].

== Uses ==
The most popular use of webcams is the establishment of [[videotelephony|video links]], permitting computers to act as [[videophone]]s or [[video conferencing|videoconference station]]s. Other popular uses include security surveillance, [[computer vision]], video broadcasting, and for recording social videos.

The video streams provided by webcams can be used for a number of purposes, each using appropriate software:

=== Health care ===
Most modern webcams are capable of [http://sourceforge.net/projects/pulsecapture/ capturing arterial pulse rate] by the use of a simple algorithmic trick. Researchers claim that this method is accurate to ±5 bpm.

=== Video monitoring ===
Webcams may be installed at places such as childcare centres, offices, shops and private areas to monitor security and general activity.

=== Commerce ===
Webcams have been used for [[augmented reality]] experiences online.  One such function has the webcam act as a "magic mirror" to allow an online shopper to view a virtual item on themselves. The [[Webcam Social Shopper]] is one example of software that utilizes the webcam in this manner.&lt;ref&gt;[http://techland.time.com/2011/08/05/augmented-reality-lets-you-try-on-clothes-from-online-shops/ "Augmented Reality Lets You Try On Clothes from Online Shops"] [[TIME]], 5 August 2011, retrieved 4 July 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Videocalling and videoconferencing ===
{{Further information|Videophone|Videoconferencing|Videotelephony}}
Webcam can be added to [[instant messaging]], text chat services such as [[AOL Instant Messenger]], and [[VoIP]] services such as [[Skype]], one-to-one live video communication over the Internet has now reached millions of mainstream [[Personal computer|PC]] users worldwide. Improved video quality has helped webcams encroach on traditional video conferencing systems. New features such as automatic lighting controls, real-time enhancements (retouching, wrinkle smoothing and vertical stretch), automatic [[Facial motion capture|face tracking]] and autofocus, assist users by providing substantial ease-of-use, further increasing the popularity of webcams.

Webcam features and performance can vary by [[computer program|program]], [[operating system|computer operating system]], and also by the computer's [[Central processing unit|processor]] capabilities. Video calling support has also been added to several [[List of video telecommunication services and product brands#Software clients –free instant messaging programs|popular instant messaging programs]].

=== Video security ===
Webcams can be used as [[security camera]]s. Software is available to allow PC-connected cameras to watch for movement and sound,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.e-consystems.com/PR/PressRelease_e-con_Announces_3MP_AutoFocus_Camera.pdf USB Camera with integrated UVC+UAC and Autofocus CMOS OV3640 CMOS Image sensor]&lt;/ref&gt; recording both when they are detected. These recordings can then be saved to the computer, e-mailed, or uploaded to the Internet. In one well-publicised case,&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/cambridgeshire/4272041.stm Serial burglar caught on webcam] [[BBC News]], February 16, 2005, retrieved January 3, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; a computer e-mailed images of the burglar during the theft of the computer, enabling the owner to give police a clear picture of the burglar's face even after the computer had been stolen.

Unauthorized access of webcams can present significant privacy issues (see "Privacy" section below).

In December 2011, Russia announced that 290,000 Webcams would be installed in 90,000 polling stations to monitor the [[Russian presidential election, 2012]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://blogs.wsj.com/emergingeurope/2012/01/16/russia-election-webcams-linked-to-site-blamed-for-piracy/ Russia Election Webcams] ''The Wall Street Journal'', January 16, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Video clips and stills===
Webcams can be used to take [[video clip]]s and [[Digital photography|still pictures]]. Various software tools in wide use can be employed for this, such as [[PicMaster]] (for use with [[Windows]] operating systems), [[Photo Booth]] ([[Mac (computer)|Mac]]), or [[Cheese (software)|Cheese]] (with [[Unix]] systems). For a more complete list see [[Comparison of webcam software]].

=== Input control devices ===
Special software can use the video stream from a webcam to assist or enhance a user's control of applications and games. Video features, including faces, shapes, models and colors can be observed and tracked to produce a corresponding form of control. For example, the position of a single light source can be tracked and used to emulate a mouse pointer, a head-mounted light would enable [[hands-free computing]] and would greatly improve [[computer accessibility]]. This can be applied to games, providing additional control, improved interactivity and immersiveness.

[[FreeTrack]] is a free webcam motion-tracking application for [[Microsoft Windows]] that can track a special head-mounted model in up to six [[Degrees of freedom (mechanics)|degrees of freedom]] and output data to mouse, keyboard, joystick and [[List of games compatible with FreeTrack|FreeTrack-supported games]]. By removing the IR filter of the webcam, IR LEDs can be used, which has the advantage of being invisible to the naked eye, removing a distraction from the user. [[TrackIR]] is a commercial version of this technology.

The [[EyeToy]] for the [[PlayStation 2]], [[PlayStation Eye]] for the [[PlayStation 3]], and the [[Xbox Live Vision]] camera and [[Kinect]] motion sensor for the [[Xbox 360]] and are color digital cameras that have been used as control input devices by some games.

Small webcam-based [[PC Games (magazine)|PC games]] are available as either standalone executables or inside web browser windows using [[Adobe Flash]].

=== Astro photography ===
With very-low-light capability, a few specific models of webcams are very popular to photograph the night sky by astronomers and astro photographers. Mostly, these are manual-focus cameras and contain an old CCD array instead of comparatively newer CMOS array. The lenses of the cameras are removed and then these are attached to telescopes to record images, video, still, or both. In newer techniques, videos of very faint objects are taken for a couple of seconds and then all the frames of the video are "stacked" together to obtain a still image of respectable contrast.

===Laser beam profiling===

A webcam's CCD response is linear proportional to the incoming light. &lt;ref&gt;Cignoli F, De Iuliis S, Zizak GA. Webcam as a light probe beam profiler. Appl. Spectrosc. 58, (2004), 1372.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, webcams are suitable to record laser beam profiles, after the lens is removed. The resolution of a [[laser beam profiler]] depends on the pixel size. Commercial webcams are usually designed to record color images. The size of a webcam's color pixel depends on the model and may lie in the range of 5 to 10µm. However, a color pixel consists of four black and white pixels each equipped with a color filter (for details see [[Bayer filter]]). Although these color filters work well in the visible, they may be rather transparent in the near infra-red. By switching a webcam into the Bayer-mode it is possible to access the information of the single pixels and a resolution below 3µm was possible. &lt;ref&gt;G. Langer et al., A webcam in Bayer-mode as a light beam profiler for the near infra-red, Optics and Lasers in Engineering 51 (2013) 571–575 &lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
{{See also|History of videotelephony}}

=== Early development ===
First developed in 1991, a webcam was pointed at the [[Trojan Room coffee pot]] in the [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge University]] Computer Science Department (initially operating over a local network instead of the web). The camera was finally switched off on August 22, 2001. The final image captured by the camera can still be viewed at its homepage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/coffee/coffee.html CoffeeCam], University of Cambridge.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/static/popup/coffeecam/cam2.html|title=Trojan Room Coffee Pot - SPIEGEL ONLINE|publisher=|accessdate=29 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, the oldest webcam still operating was FogCam at [[San Francisco State University]], which had been running continuously since 1994.&lt;ref&gt;[http://xpress.sfsu.edu/archives/life/001905.html "Happy Birthday Fogcam"] by Anjuli Elais in ''Golden Gate XPress'', September 30, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Connectix QuickCam ===
The first commercial webcam, the black-and-white [[QuickCam]], entered the marketplace in 1994, created by the U.S. computer company [[Connectix]] (which sold its product line to [[Logitech]] in 1998). QuickCam was available in August 1994 for the [[Apple Macintosh]], connecting via a [[serial port]], at a cost of $100.  Jon Garber, the designer of the device, had wanted to call it the "Mac-camera", but was overruled by Connectix's marketing department; a version with a PC-compatible parallel port and software for  [[Microsoft Windows]] was launched in October 1995.  The original QuickCam provided 320x240-pixel resolution with a grayscale depth of 16 shades at 60 frames per second, or 256 shades at 15 frames per second.&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, Benj. [http://www.pcworld.com/article/199112/victorian_scifi.html History of Video Calls: From Fantasy to Flops to Facetime], [[PC World (magazine)|PC World Magazine]], June 17, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;  These cam were tested on several Delta II launch using a variety of communication protocols including CDMA, TDMA, GSM and HF.

In 2010, [[Time Magazine]] named the QuickCam as one of the top computer devices of all time.&lt;ref&gt;Ha, Peter. [http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,2023689_2023703_2023628,00.html Computing: Connectix QuickCam], [[Time Magazine]], October 25, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Videoconferencing]] via computers already existed, and at the time [[Client–server model|client-server]] based videoconferencing software such as [[CU-SeeMe]] had started to become popular.

=== Later developments ===
One of the most widely reported-on webcam sites was [[JenniCam]], created in 1996, which allowed Internet users to observe the life of its namesake constantly, in the same vein as the [[Reality television|reality TV series]] ''[[Big Brother (TV series)|Big Brother]]'', launched four years later.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/international/story/0,,1115262,00.html "Plug pulled on live website seen by millions"] by Oliver Burkeman in ''The Guardian'', January 3, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;  Other cameras are mounted overlooking bridges, public squares, and other public places, their output made available on a public web page in accordance with the original concept of a "webcam".  Aggregator websites have also been created, providing thousands of live video streams or up-to-date still pictures, allowing users to find live video streams based on location or other criteria.

Around the turn of the 21st century, computer hardware manufacturers began building webcams directly into [[laptop]] and desktop screens, thus eliminating the need to use an external USB or [[FireWire]] camera.  Gradually webcams came to be used more for telecommunications, or [[videotelephony]], between two people, or among several people, than for offering a view on a Web page to an unknown public.

For less than US$100 in 2012, a [[three-dimensional|three-dimensional space]] webcam became available, producing videos and photos in 3D [[anaglyph image]] with a resolution up to 1280 × 480 pixels. Both sender and receiver of the images must use 3D glasses to see the effect of three dimensional image.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lanxon |first=Nate |url=http://crave.cnet.co.uk/gadgets/3d-photos-minoru-3d-webcam-hands-on-49303012/ |title=3D photos: Minoru 3D webcam hands-on &amp;#124; CNET UK |publisher=Crave.cnet.co.uk |date=2009-07-16 |accessdate=2013-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Technology ==
[[File:Sweex USB webcam PCB with without lens close up.jpg|thumb|225px|right|Webcams typically include a lens (shown at top), an image sensor (shown at bottom), and supporting circuitry]]

Webcams typically include a lens, an [[image sensor]], support electronics, and may also include a [[microphone]] for sound. Various lenses are available, the most common in consumer-grade webcams being a plastic [[Lens (optics)|lens]] that can be screwed in and out to focus the camera. [[Fixed-focus lens]]es, which have no provision for adjustment, are also available. As a camera system's [[depth of field]] is greater for small image formats and is greater for lenses with a large [[f-number]] (small aperture), the systems used in webcams have a sufficiently large depth of field that the use of a fixed-focus lens does not impact image sharpness to a great extent.

Image sensors can be [[CMOS]] or [[Charge-coupled device|CCD]], the former being dominant for low-cost cameras, but CCD cameras do not necessarily outperform CMOS-based cameras in the low-price range. Most consumer webcams are capable of providing [[Video Graphics Array|VGA]]-resolution video at a [[frame rate]] of 30 frames per second. Many newer devices can produce video in multi-[[megapixel]] resolutions, and a few can run at high frame rates such as the [[PlayStation Eye]], which can produce [[Quarter VGA|320×240]] video at 120 frames per second.

Support electronics read the image from the sensor and transmit it to the host computer. The camera pictured to the right, for example, uses a Sonix SN9C101 to transmit its image over [[Universal Serial Bus|USB]]. Typically, each frame is transmitted uncompressed in [[RGB]] or [[YUV]] or compressed as [[JPEG]]. Some cameras, such as [[camera phone|mobile-phone cameras]], use a CMOS sensor with supporting electronics "on die", i.e. the sensor and the support electronics are built on a single [[Integrated circuit|silicon chip]] to save space and manufacturing costs. Most webcams feature built-in [[microphone]]s to make [[videotelephone|video calling]] and [[videoconferencing]] more convenient.

The [[USB video device class]] (UVC) specification allows interconnectivity of webcams to computers without the need for proprietary device drivers. Microsoft [[Windows XP]] SP2, [[Linux]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kernelnewbies.org/Linux_2_6_26#head-6d4ee1ddea983f5c8ac491b8685a94ea6fa4132b|title=Linux 2 6 26|publisher=|accessdate=29 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Mac OS X]] (since October 2005) have UVC support built in and do not require extra device drivers, although they are often installed to add additional features.

== Privacy ==
Many users do not wish the continuous exposure for which webcams were originally intended, but rather prefer privacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://br.noticias.yahoo.com/jogador-esquece-webcam-ligada-transmite-sexo-namorada.html|title=Jogador esquece webcam ligada e transmite sexo com namorada|date=13 November 2012|work=Yahoo Notícias|accessdate=29 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such privacy is lost when [[malware]] allow [[Hacker (computer security)|malicious hackers]] to activate the webcam without the user's knowledge, providing the hackers with a live video and audio feed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gray|first=Leon|title=Virtual crime! : solving cybercrime|year=2009|publisher=Enslow Publishers|location=Berkeley Heights, NJ|isbn=0766033767|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=B2utHHdYJOcC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA5&amp;dq=ivacy+is+lost+when+Trojan+horse+programs+allow+malicious+hackers+to+activate+the+webcam+&amp;ots=6xUolQ_x9M&amp;sig=uUxTma9QTdwOzn1sma4bgzUAqkU#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is a particular concern on many laptop computers, as such cameras normally cannot be physically disabled if hijacked by such a [[Trojan Horse]] program or other similar [[spyware]] programs.

Cameras such as [[Apple Computer|Apple]]'s older external [[iSight]] cameras include lens covers to thwart this. Some webcams have built-in hardwired [[Light-emitting diode|LED]] indicators that light up whenever the camera is active, sometimes only in video mode{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}}. However, it is possible for [[malware]] to circumvent the indicator and activate the camera surrepticiously, as researchers demonstrated in the case of a [[MacBook]]'s built-in camera in 2013.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/06/surveillance-camera-laptop-smartphone-cover-tape|title=Why is everyone covering up their laptop cameras?|last=Yadron|first=Danny|date=2016-06-06|website=the Guardian|access-date=2016-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various companies sell sliding lens covers and stickers that allow users to retrofit a computer or smartphone to close access to the camera lens as needed.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; One such company reported having sold more than 250,000 such items from 2013 to 2016.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However, any opaque material will work. Prominent users include former FBI director [[James Comey]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The fraudulent process of attempting to hack into a person's webcam and activate it without the webcam owner's permission has been called [[camfecting]]. The remotely activated webcam can be used to watch anything within the webcam's field of vision, sometimes the webcam owner itself. Camfecting is most often carried out by infecting the victim's computer with a virus that can provide the hacker access to the victim's webcam. This attack is specifically targeted at the victim's webcam, and hence the name ''camfecting'', a [[portmanteau]] of the words ''cam'' and ''infecting''. 

In January 2005, some [[Web search engine|search engine]] queries were published in an online forum&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theregister.co.uk/2005/01/08/web_surveillance_cams_open_to_all/ "Google exposes web surveillance cams"] by Kevin Poulsen, ''The Register'', January 8, 2005, retrieved September 5, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; which allow anyone to find thousands of [[Panasonic]]- and [[Axis Communications|Axis]] high-end web cameras, provided that they have a web-based [[Interface (computing)|interface]] for remote viewing. Many such cameras are running on default configuration, which does not require any [[password]] login or [[IP address]] verification, making them viewable by anyone.

In the 2010 ''[[Robbins v.

== Effects on modern society ==
Webcams allow for inexpensive, real-time [[video chat]] and [[webcasting]], in both amateur and professional pursuits. They are frequently used in [[online dating]] and for online personal services offered mainly by women when [[camgirl]]ing. However, the ease of webcam use through the Internet for video chat has also caused issues. For example, moderation system of various video chat websites such as [[Omegle]] has been criticized as being ineffective, with sexual content still rampant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Problems with Omegle Girls and Free Chat Services|url=http://www.omeglegirlschat.com/omegle-controversy|publisher=OmegleGirlsChat|accessdate=14 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2013 case, the transmission of nude photos and videos via Omegle from a teenage girl to a schoolteacher resulted in a [[child pornography]] charge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ex-band teacher pleads guilty to porn charge with girl, 16|url=http://www.jconline.com/article/20130426/NEWS03/304260027/child-porn-former-teacher-nude-photos|publisher=jconline.com|accessdate=14 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[YouTube]] is a popular website hosting many videos made using webcams. News websites such as the [[British Broadcasting Corporation|BBC]] also produce professional live news videos using webcams rather than traditional cameras.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/london/content/webcams/bbclondon_studio_webcam.shtml|title=BBC - London - In Pictures - BBC London Radio Studio 1|publisher=|accessdate=29 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=September 2013|reason=The link says nothing about the type of camera.}}

Webcams can also encourage [[telecommuting]], enabling people to work from home via the Internet, rather than traveling to their office.

The popularity of webcams among teenagers with Internet access has raised concern about the use of webcams for [[cyber-bullying]].&lt;ref&gt;Poeter, Damon. "[https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2401701,00.asp Webcam Peeper Convicted in Rutgers Cyberbullying Case]," ''[[PC Magazine]],'' March 16, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Webcam recordings of teenagers, including underage teenagers, are frequently posted on popular Web forums and [[imageboard]]s such as [[4chan]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thesmokinggun.com/buster/4chan-reports-child-pornographer-769123 Tip From 4chan Leads To Arrest Of Site Visitor On Child Porn Charges]," ''[[The Smoking Gun]],'' February 27, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Goodin, Dan.

== Descriptive names and terminology ==
''Videophone calls'' (also: ''[[videocalls]]'' and ''[[video chat]]''),&lt;ref&gt;PC Magazine.

Pg. 291.&lt;/ref&gt; However that distinction has become increasingly blurred with technology improvements such as [[Broadband Internet access|increased bandwidth]] and sophisticated [[software client]]s that can allow for multiple parties on a call. In general everyday usage the term ''videoconferencing'' is now frequently used instead of ''videocall'' for point-to-point calls between two units. Both videophone calls and videoconferencing are also now commonly referred to as a ''video link''.

Webcams are popular, relatively low cost devices which can provide live video and audio streams via personal computers, and can be used with many [[List of video telecommunication services and product brands#Software Client brands|software clients]] for both video calls and videoconferencing.&lt;ref&gt;

A [[List of video telecommunication services and product brands#Video conferencing systems meant for multiple participants|videoconference system]] is generally higher cost than a videophone and deploys greater capabilities. A ''videoconference'' (also known as a ''videoteleconference'') allows two or more locations to communicate via live, simultaneous two-way video and audio transmissions. This is often accomplished by the use of a [[multipoint control unit]] (a centralized distribution and call management system) or by a similar non-centralized multipoint capability embedded in each videoconferencing unit. Again, technology improvements have circumvented traditional definitions by allowing multiple party videoconferencing via web-based applications.&lt;ref&gt;Lawson, Stephen.

A separate webpage article is devoted to [[videoconferencing]].

A [[Telepresence|telepresence system]] is a high-end videoconferencing system and service usually employed by [[company|enterprise-level]] corporate offices. Telepresence conference rooms use state-of-the art room designs, video cameras, displays, sound-systems and processors, coupled with high-to-very-high capacity bandwidth transmissions.

Typical use of the various technologies described above include calling or conferencing on a one-on-one, one-to-many or many-to-many basis for personal, business, educational, [[Video Relay Service|deaf Video Relay Service]] and [[telemedicine|tele-medical, diagnostic]] and [[telerehabilitation|rehabilitative]] use or services. New services utilizing videocalling and videoconferencing, such as teachers and psychologists conducting online sessions,&lt;ref name="USAToday-2010.03.31"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; personal videocalls to [[prison|inmates incarcerated in penitentiaries]], and videoconferencing to resolve [[Aircraft maintenance checks|airline engineering issues]] at [[hangar|maintenance facilities]], are being created or evolving on an ongoing basis.
