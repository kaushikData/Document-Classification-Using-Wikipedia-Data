'''4585 Ainonai''', provisional designation {{mp|1990 KQ}}, is a carbonaceous [[asteroid]] from the central region of the [[asteroid belt]], approximately 15 kilometers in diameter. It was discovered on 16 May 1990, by Japanese amateur astronomers [[Kin Endate]] and [[Kazuro Watanabe]] at the [[Kitami Observatory]] in eastern Hokkaidō, Japan.&lt;ref name="MPC-Ainonai" /&gt; It was named for the town of Ainonai located near the discovering observatory.&lt;ref name="springer" /&gt;

== Orbit and classification ==

''Ainonai'' orbits the Sun in the [[Kirkwood gap|central]] main-belt at a distance of 2.1–3.4&amp;nbsp;[[Astronomical unit|AU]] once every 4 years and 6 months (1,652 days). Its orbit has an [[orbital eccentricity|eccentricity]] of 0.24 and an [[orbital inclination|inclination]] of 11[[Degree (angle)|°]] with respect to the [[ecliptic]].&lt;ref name="jpldata" /&gt;

In 1972, it was first identified as {{mp|1972 LU}} at [[Crimea–Nauchnij]], extending the body's [[observation arc]] by 18 years prior to its official discovery observation at Kitami.&lt;ref name="MPC-Ainonai" /&gt;

== Physical characteristics ==

''Ainonai'' has been characterized as a carbonaceous [[C-type asteroid]].&lt;ref name="lcdb" /&gt;

=== Lightcurve ===

A rotational [[lightcurve]] was obtained from photometric observation made at the Via Capote Observatory, California, in June 2008. It showed a longer than-average [[rotation period]] of {{val|38.31|0.05}} hours with a brightness amplitude of 0.30 in [[Magnitude (astronomy)|magnitude]] ({{small|[[LCDB quality code|U=3-]]}})&lt;ref name="Brinsfield-2008d" /&gt;

=== Diameter and albedo ===

According to observations from the [[NEOWISE]] mission of NASA's space-based [[Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer]], ''Ainonai'' has an [[astronomical albedo|albedo]] of 0.11 with a corresponding diameter of 10.9 kilometers.&lt;ref name="WISE" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Masiero-2011" /&gt; The ''Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link'' assumes a standard albedo for carbonaceous asteroids of 0.057 and calculates a diameter of 15.3 kilometers with an [[absolute magnitude]] of 12.8.&lt;ref name="lcdb" /&gt;

== Naming ==

This [[minor planet]] was named after Ainonai, a small Japanese town located near [[Kitami, Hokkaido|Kitami]] in eastern [[Hokkaidō]]. The minor planets [[3785&amp;nbsp;Kitami]] and [[3720&amp;nbsp;Hokkaido]] are named after these two places.&lt;ref name="springer" /&gt; The official naming citation was published by the [[Minor Planet Center]] on 21 November 1991 ({{small|[[Minor Planet Circulars|M.P.C.]] 19338}}).&lt;ref name="MPC-Circulars-Archive" /&gt;

}}'''Allchar deposit''' (alternative spellings '''Alsar deposit''', '''Alšar deposit''' or '''Alshar deposit''') is a low-temperature [[hydrothermal]] [[gold]]–[[arsenic]]–[[antimony]]–[[thallium]] [[Deposition (geology)|deposit]] in [[Kavadarci Municipality]], southern [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]]. For some time, the thallium-rich part of the deposit was mined. The Crven Dol mine yielded [[thallium]] and the ore body still holds estimated amount of 500&amp;nbsp;t of thallium. The mineral [[lorandite]] from this ore deposit is being used to determine the [[solar neutrino]] flux.&lt;ref name=j1/&gt;&lt;ref name=j2/&gt;

==Geology==
The deposit is a [[Carlin–type gold deposit]], similar to those found in the [[Carlin Unconformity]], [[Nevada]].

==Minerals==
Pyrite, [[stibnite]], orpiment and realgar are the main minerals forming the ore. Lorandite – a thallium arsenic [[sulfosalt mineral]] with formula TlAsS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; – is the main thallium mineral in the deposit. Several other thallium minerals have been discovered in the mine over the years, for example, [[jankovićite]] (Tl&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;Sb&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;(As,Sb)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;22&lt;/sub&gt;, [[fangite]] (Tl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;AsS&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) and [[bernardite]] (TI(Sb,As)&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;).&lt;ref name="Janco"/&gt;

==LOREX==
LORandite EXperiment (LOREX) is using lorandite from the ore deposit to determine the [[solar neutrino]] flux. This mineral contains large amounts of [[thallium-205]] which undergoes a neutrino capturing reaction and yields [[lead-205]] in the process. The &lt;sup&gt;205&lt;/sup&gt;Tl(ν&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;,e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;205&lt;/sup&gt; process has a relatively low threshold energy of 52 [[keV]] and thus relatively high efficiency. With the age of the deposit of 4.5 to 4.2 million years, the solar neutrino flux can be estimated over the last 4 million years provided it is possible to determine the amount of lead-205 in a lorandite sample. This reaction can be induced not only by neutrino but other high energy cosmic particles, which all have different penetration depth in the crust. Therefore, a large volume of data is being accumulated during 2008–2010 from different depths of the deposit to produce reliable data.&lt;ref name=j1&gt;{{cite journal|doi = 10.1016/0168-9002(88)90171-4|title = Lorandite from Allchar — A low energy solar neutrino dosimeter|year = 1988|last1 = Pavicevic|first1 = M|journal = Nuclear Instruments and Methods in Physics Research Section A: Accelerators, Spectrometers, Detectors and Associated Equipment|volume = 271|pages = 287|issue = 2|bibcode = 1988NIMPA.271..287P }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=j2&gt;{{cite journal|doi =10.1063/1.57378|title =Status of the LOREX: Geochemical|year =1998|last1 =Subotic|first1 =K.

'''''Antarctic''''' was a [[Sweden|Swedish]] [[steamship]] built in [[Drammen]], [[Norway]] in 1871. She was used on several research expeditions to the [[Arctic]] region and to [[Antarctica]] through 1898-1903. In 1895 the first confirmed landing on the mainland of Antarctica was made from this ship.

==The ship==
''Antarctic'' was a [[barque]] with three masts and equipped with a [[steam engine]]. Built in 1871 at Holmen in [[Drammen]] under the name ''Cap Nor''.&lt;ref name=A&gt;[http://runeberg.org/polexp1898/0017.html], Alfred Nathorst, ”Två Somrar i Norra Ishafvet”, first part (in Swedish), 1900, accessdate=2010-12-10&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BB&gt;[http://www.nb.no/utlevering/contentview.jsf?&amp;urn=URN:NBN:no-nb_digibok_2008121110001#&amp;struct=DIV44], Henrik Bull, ”The cruise of the "Antarctic" to the South Polar regions”, 1896, accessdate=2010-12-10&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=B&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geo.uu.se/default.aspx?pageid=213&amp;lan=0 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-12-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725113619/http://www.geo.uu.se/default.aspx?pageid=213&amp;lan=0 |archivedate=2011-07-25 }}, Department of Earth Sciences, Uppsala University (in Swedish), accessdate=2010-12-10&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially ''Antarctic'' was used for [[seal hunting]] around [[Svalbard]], [[Jan Mayen]] and [[Greenland]],&lt;ref name=AA&gt;[http://runeberg.org/nfba/0622.html], Nordisk Familjebok, Project Runeberg, Linköping University (in Swedish), accessdate=2010-12-10&lt;/ref&gt;.  During that period the ship was captained by Gullik Jensen and among others [[Carsten Borchgrevink]] served on the ship.

In the early 1890s Norwegian ship-owner [[Svend Foyn]] wanted to expand his business to the Antarctic Ocean thereby needing capable ships. Foyn then purchased ''Cap Nor'', made extensive repairs and after completion renamed the ship ''Antarctic''.&lt;ref name=A/&gt;&lt;ref name=B/&gt;&lt;ref name=AA/&gt; From 1893 the ship was deployed to the [[Antarctic ocean]] for [[whale hunting]].

In 1897 the ship was purchased by [[Alfred Gabriel Nathorst]] for his planned expedition to Svalbard. Again extensive repairs were made prior to the expedition in 1898.&lt;ref name=A/&gt;&lt;ref name=B/&gt;&lt;ref name=AA/&gt;

In 1899 Nathorst sold the ship to [[Georg Carl Amdrup]] for his expedition to [[Tunu|East Greenland]].&lt;ref name=AA/&gt;

In 1900 Amdrup sold ''Antarctic'' to [[Otto Nordenskjöld]] who needed the ship for his [[Swedish Antarctic Expedition|Antarctic expedition]].

==The expeditions==
[[File:Antarctic 2.png|thumb|''Antarctic'' leaving Gothenburg harbor, 1901]]
In 1893 ''Antarctic'' captained by [[Leonard Kristensen]] set off on a whaling expedition to Antarctica led by [[Henrik Johan Bull]] and financed by Foyn. The ship was equipped with 11 harpoon guns, an arsenal of explosives, 8 whaleboats and 31 men and left [[Tønsberg]] on September 20, 1893. The first summer was spent around the [[Kerguelen Islands]] with winter camp in [[Melbourne]]. On September 28, 1894 the ship went off to sea heading for the [[Ross Sea]].

On January 24, 1895 a boat was put ashore at [[Cape Adare]] at the northern extremity of [[Victoria Land]] with six men including Bull, [[Carsten Borchgrevink|Borchgrevink]], Kristensen and [[Alexander von Tunzelmann|Tunzelmann]]. The party performed the first confirmed landing on the continent of Antarctica, exactly who went ashore first was never cleared as all members claimed the honor (possibly British-American sealer [[John Davis (sealer)|John Davis]] had already made a landing on the [[Antarctic Peninsula]] on February 7, 1821, this claim can, however, not be confirmed).&lt;ref name=XX&gt;[http://www.nb.no/utlevering/contentview.jsf?urn=URN:NBN:no-nb_digibok_2008121110001#&amp;struct=DIV204], Norska Nasjonalbiblioteket-National Library of Norway (in Norwegian), accessdate=2010-12-10&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=XXX&gt;[http://www.snl.no/.nbl_biografi/Henrik_Bull/utdypning_%E2%80%93_2], Norsk biografisk leksikon-Norwegian Biografical encyclopedia (in Norwegian), accessdate=2010-12-10&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=YY&gt;[http://www.south-pole.com/p0000052.htm], South-Pole.com, An Antarctic Timeline, accessdate=2010-12-10&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Y1&gt;[http://www.antarctic-circle.org/rosove.htm], Antarctic-Circle.org, Antarctic voyages and expeditions, accessdate=2010-12-10&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Y2&gt;[http://www.nzhistory.net.nz/media/photo/first-landing-antarctica], New Zealand History online, Ministry for Culture and Heritage, accessdate=2010-12-10&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Y3&gt;[http://www.norwaysforgottenexplorer.org/english/first-landing/], Norways Forgotten Ezplorer.org, Norwegian Directorate for Cultural Heritage, accessdate=2010-12-10&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Y4&gt;[http://www.antarctica.org.nz/02-history/index.html], Antarctica.org, Antarctic History, accessdate=2010-12-10&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1898 ''Antarctic'' captained by Emil Nilsson carried Nathorst’s polar expedition to [[Bear Island (Norway)|Bear Island]], [[Svalbard]] and [[Kong Karls Land]].&lt;ref name=A/&gt; Among the participating scientists were [[Axel Hamberg]], [[Otto Kjellström]], [[Gustaf Kolthoff]] and [[Henrik Hesselman]].&lt;ref name=B/&gt;

In 1899 the ship left on an expedition also under the command of Nathorst to [[Avannaa|North Greenland]] with the dual purpose of searching for survivors of the 1897 [[S. A. Andrée's Arctic Balloon Expedition of 1897|Andrée's Arctic Balloon Expedition]] and geographical mapping the area.&lt;ref name=C&gt;[http://runeberg.org/polexp1899/0020.html], Alfred Nathorst, ”Två Somrar i Norra Ishafvet”, second part (in Swedish), 1900, accessdate=2010-12-10&lt;/ref&gt;

Later the same year ''Antarctic'' carried Amdrup’s expedition to [[Tunu|East Greenland]].&lt;ref name=AA/&gt;

In 1901 the ship, then on loan from Nordenskjöld, carried the second season of the [[Swedish-Russian Arc-of-Meridian Expedition]] under the command of [[Gerard De Geer]] to [[Svalbard]].&lt;ref name=AA/&gt;&lt;ref name=T&gt;[http://gupea.ub.gu.se/dspace/bitstream/2077/10635/1/gupea_2077_10635_1.pdf], Department of Earth Sciences, Lisbeth Levander, Uppsala University (in Swedish), accessdate=2010-12-10&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 16, 1901 ''Antarctic'' now captained by [[Carl Anton Larsen]] left [[Gothenburg]] harbor on Nordenskjold’s [[Swedish Antarctic Expedition|Antarctic expedition]].&lt;ref name=X&gt;[http://www.south-pole.com/p0000091.htm], South-Pole.com, Nordenskjöld article, accessdate=2010-12-10&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Y&gt;[http://runeberg.org/hvar8dag/3/0406.html], Hvar 8 dag, Project Runeberg, Linköping University (in Swedish), accessdate=2010-12-10&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=V&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bjerrang.no/aq/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-12-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713223627/http://www.bjerrang.no/aq/ |archivedate=2011-07-13 }}, Bjerrang, Antarctic quest, accessdate=2010-12-10&lt;/ref&gt; This would become the ship's last voyage.

==The ship wrecking==
[[File:SSAntarctic.jpg|thumb|''Antarctic'' trapped in pack ice]]

After exploring parts of the [[South Shetland Islands]] the expedition continued through the [[Antarctic Sound]] towards the [[Antarctic Peninsula]]. On January 15, 1902 [[Hope Bay]] was discovered. In February Nordenskjöld chose [[Snow Hill Island]] as winter camp for part of the expedition. After all preparations were completed ''Antarctic'' left for the [[Falkland Islands]].

After the winter the ship left the Falklands on November 5 heading back to the Antarctic Peninsula by way of [[Ushuaia]] for supplies. On December 29 ''Antarctic'' was trapped in pack ice near Hope Bay, and some of the crew was put ashore.&lt;ref name=X/&gt;

''Antarctic'' later broke free and continued towards [[Paulet Island]]; on the way the ship once again was trapped in pack ice on January 3, 1903. On February 3 the ship again broke free but was now damaged and leaking. Captain Larsen now intended to beach ''Antarctic'' on Paulet Island, but the ship was too damaged and sank about {{convert|40|km|mi|abbr=on}} off the coast on February 12, 1903.&lt;ref name=T/&gt;&lt;ref name=X/&gt;&lt;ref name=V/&gt;&lt;ref name=W&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chalmers.se/HyperText/ChalmersMagasin/nr2_2003/Bodman.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-12-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717192230/http://www.chalmers.se/HyperText/ChalmersMagasin/nr2_2003/Bodman.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-17 }}, Chalmers Magazine, Chalmers University of Technology (in Swedish), accessdate=2010-12-10&lt;/ref&gt;

In November all crewmembers (including [[Carl Skottsberg]], [[Johan Gunnar Andersson]], [[José María Sobral]] and [[Frank Wilbert Stokes]]) were rescued by the Argentine [[corvette]] [[ARA Uruguay|''Uruguay'']] captained by [[Julián Irízar]].

==Epitaph==
When Nathorst heard about the ship wrecking he commented "seems to me more glorious than if she had gone to meet the usual fate of vessels to slowly rot in some port, or to be used for something far off from her designation and purposes as an icy seas and research vessel".&lt;ref name=B/&gt;

In 1944 Johan Gunnar Andersson published a commemorative book ''Antarctic :Stolt har hon levat Stolt skall hon dö – Antarctic: proud she lived proud she shall die''.

'''Auchenshoogle''' is a fictional [[Scotland|Scottish]] town, an amalgam of [[Dundee]] and [[Glasgow]], the setting (originally unnamed) of the [[comic strips]] ''[[Oor Wullie]]'' and ''[[The Broons]]'' in ''[[The Sunday Post]]''. The name was used infrequently in the early days of the comic strip, coming into more frequent use in the late 1990s.

The term has since become a generic Scottish small-town name, used for humour or as a dummy name in legal discussions&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.caledonia.org.uk/land/feudal2.htm |title=The Abolition of Feudal Tenure etc. (Scotland) Act 2000.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4835">The '''Berkeley School of Latin Americanist Geography''' was founded by the American [[geographer]] [[Carl O. Sauer]]. Sauer was a [[professor]] of [[geography]] at the [[University of California at Berkeley]] from 1923 until becoming professor [[emeritus]] in 1957 and was instrumental in the early development of the geography graduate program at Berkeley and the discipline of [[geography]] in the [[United States]]. Each generation of this research school has pursued new theoretical and methodological approaches, but their study of the peoples and places of Latin America and the Caribbean has remained the common denominator since the early 20th century. Carl O. Sauer himself did not develop a particular interest in Latin America before 1925, when [[Oskar Schmieder]], a German geographer, disciple of [[Alfred Hettner]], and expert in Latin American regional geography, arrived at Berkeley, coming from Córdoba, Argentina, to work as an Associate Professor. Obviously, his interest awoke during Schmieder's presence between 1925 and 1930. After Schmieder's departure in 1930, Carl O. Sauer began to offer seminars on the regional geography of Latin America.

==First Generation==
Sauer graduated many doctoral students, the majority completing dissertations on Latin American and Caribbean topics and thereby founding the Berkeley School of Latin Americanist Geography.&lt;ref&gt;Scott S. Brown and Kent Mathewson, "Sauer's Descent?, Or Berkeley Roots Forever?," ''APCG Yearbook'' 61 (1999): 137-57&lt;/ref&gt; Sauer's [[Ph.D.]] students who completed dissertations on Latin American and Caribbean topics are [[Fred Kniffen]] (1930), [[Peveril Meigs]] (1932), Donald Brand (1933), Henry Bruman (1940), Felix W. McBryde (1940), Robert Bowman (1941), {{Interlanguage link multi|Dan Stanislawski|nl}} (1944), [[Robert C. West (geographer)|Robert C. West]] (1946), [[James J. Parsons]] (1948), Edwin Doran (1953), Philip Wagner (1953), Brigham Arnold (1954), Homer Aschmann (1954), B. LeRoy Gordon (1954), Gordon Merrill (1957), Donald Innis (1958), Carl Johannessen (1959), Clinton Edwards (1962), and Leonard Sawatzky (1967).

==Second Generation==
Of Sauer's doctoral students, James J. Parsons became the most prolific in terms of directing Latin Americanist doctoral dissertations. He remained at the [[University of California at Berkeley]] and produced many of the [[Ph.D.]]s in the second generation of the Berkeley School of Latin Americanist Geography: Campbell Pennington (1959), [[William Denevan]] (1963), David Harris (1963), Thomas Veblen (1975), and [[Karl Zimmerer]] (1987).

==Third Generation==
One of the second generation, [[William Denevan]], became a professor at the [[University of Wisconsin-Madison]] and, in turn, produced the majority of the third generation. Denevan's [[Ph.D.]] students who completed dissertations on Latin American topics are, among others,  [[Daniel W. Gade]] (1967; co-chaired), [[Bernard Nietschmann]] (1970), Roger Byrne (1972), Roland Bergmann (1974), [[Billie Lee Turner II]] (1974), Stuart White (1981), Hildegardo Córdova (1982), Gregory Knapp (1984), [[Kent Mathewson]] (1987), John M. Treacy (1989), and Oliver Coomes (1992).

==Subsequent Generations==
A member of the fourth generation, [[William E. Doolittle]] studied with [[Billie Lee Turner II]], a prominent member of the third generation. Doolittle earned the [[Ph.D.]] in 1979, became a professor in the [[Department of Geography and the Environment at University of Texas at Austin]], and has extended the school into the fifth generation. Doolittle's [[Ph.D.]] students who completed dissertations on Latin American topics are Dean P. Lambert (1992), [[Andrew Sluyter]] (1995), Emily H. Young (1995), Eric P. Perramond (1999), Phil L. Crossley  (1999), Jerry O. (Joby) Bass (2003), Maria G. Fadiman (2003), and Matthew Fry (2008).

Several of that fifth generation hold faculty positions in university departments with doctoral programs, and a sixth generation is now emerging. They are applying new approaches and research questions to the study of the peoples and places of Latin America and the Caribbean.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.ine.gob.mx/publicaciones/libros/645/kent.pdf Kent Mathewson, "Sauer’s Berkeley School Legacy: Foundation for an Emergent Environmental Geography?,"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120415172328/http://www2.ine.gob.mx/publicaciones/libros/645/kent.pdf |date=2012-04-15 }}.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5016">'''Cindi Katz''' (born 1954 in New York City), a geographer, is Professor in Environmental Psychology, Earth and Environmental Sciences, American Studies, and Women's Studies at the [[CUNY Graduate Center]]. Her work concerns [[social reproduction]] and the production of space, place and nature; children and the environment; the consequences of global economic restructuring for everyday life; and the intertwined spatialities of homeland and home-based security.

She is a member of the [[Children's Environmental Research Group]] at the Center for Human Environments and sits on the Advisory Boards of the [[Center for Place, Culture and Politics]] and the Women's Studies Certificate Program, both at the CUNY Graduate Center. She is a member of the Solidarity Board of Community Voices Heard in New York City.

==Education==
Katz received her BA, MA, and PhD from [[Clark University]]. She is known for her work on social reproduction and everyday life, research on children's geographies, her intervention on "minor theory", and the notion of counter-topography, which is a means of recognizing the historical and geographical specificities of particular places while inferring their analytic connections to specific material social practices.&lt;ref&gt;Key Thinkers on Space and Place, Phil Hubbard and Rob Kitchen (Eds.), Sage. Chapter by Tracey Skelton, pp. 264-71.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Dictionary of Human Geography, 5th Edition. D. Gregory, R. Johnston, G. Pratt, M. Watts and S. Whatmore (Eds.) Wiley-Blackwell, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publications==
She has published widely on these themes as well as on social theory and the politics of knowledge in edited collections and in journals such as ''Environment and Planning D: Society and Space'', ''[[Social Text]]'', ''[[Signs (journal)|Signs]]'', ''Feminist Studies'', ''Annals of the Association of American Geographers'', ''Social Justice'', ''Gender, Place, and Culture'', ''Cultural Geographies'', ''[[Antipode (journal)|Antipode]]'', and ''Public Culture''. Katz was co–general editor of ''[[WSQ: Women's Studies Quarterly]]'' with [[Nancy K. Miller]] from 2004 to 2008.

==Award==
Katz and Miller were awarded the Council of Editors of Learned Journals (CELJ) 2007 Phoenix Award for Significant Editorial Achievement. This award is given to the most-improved journal that has launched an overall effort of revitalization or transformation within the previous three years. She was a founding editor of ''Social and Cultural Geography'' and the first book review editor of ''Gender, Place, and Culture,'' and has served on the editorial boards of ''Annals of the Association of American Geographers, Environment and Planning D: Society and Space, Social Text, Professional Geographer,'' and ''Antipode.''

==Editor==
Katz is the editor (with [[Janice Monk]]) of ''Full Circles: Geographies of Gender over the Life Course'' (Routledge 1993), ''Life's Work: Geographies of Social Reproduction'' (with [[Sallie A. Marston]] and [[Katharyne Mitchell]]) (Blackwell 2004), and [http://peopleplacespace.org/ ''The People, Space, and Space Reader'' (with Jen Jack Gieseking, William Mangold, Setha Low, and Susan Saegert) (Routledge 2014)]. Her 2004 book, ''Growing up Global: Economic Restructuring and Children's Everyday Lives'' (University of Minnesota Press), received the 2004 Meridian Book Award for Outstanding Scholarly Work in Geography from the Association of American Geographers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20031210025328/http://www.aag.org/Grantsawards/meridian_book_award.cfm|title=Association of American Geographers|date=10 December 2003|website=archive.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Harvard==
In 2003–4, Katz was a fellow at the [[Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study at Harvard University]], where she conducted research on US childhood as spectacle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.radcliffe.harvard.edu/people/cindi-katz|title=Cindi Katz|date=16 March 2012|website=harvard.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011–12 she was the Diane Middlebrook and Carl Djerassi Visiting Professor of Gender Studies at Cambridge University and Helen Cam Visiting Fellow at Girton College.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gender.cam.ac.uk/academicvisitors/vpfolder/vps|title=Previous Visiting Professors — University of Cambridge Centre for Gender Studies|first=|last=ld356@cam.ac.uk|website=www.gender.cam.ac.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Cities Climate Finance Leadership Alliance''' (CCFLA) is a coalition of more than forty organizations actively working to accelerate investment into sustainable infrastructure. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.citiesclimatefinance.org/about/|title=About » Cities Climate Finance Leadership Alliance|website=www.citiesclimatefinance.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Alliance brings together a wide range of public and private institutions. For example, the Swiss [[Global Infrastructure Basel Foundation]] (GIB) is a member of the CCFLA Steering Committee, and occupies the “Research/NGO/Foundations” seat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gib-foundation.org/news/|title=Global Infrastructure Basel - The Sustainable Infrastructure Financing Forum and Summit|website=www.gib-foundation.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Alliance was launched at the [[United Nations Secretary-General’s Climate Summit]] in September 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:YI0WWC-_rjEJ:www.un.org/climatechange/summit/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2014/09/CITIES-Cities-Climate-Finance-Leadership-Alliance.pdf+&amp;cd=5&amp;hl=de&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=ch&amp;client=firefox-b|title=CITIES|first=Florencia Soto|last=Nino|website=webcache.googleusercontent.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2016, [[R20 Regions of Climate Action]] was elected to lead the Secretariat of CCFLA, partnering with three other organizations: [[:fr:FMDV_-_Fonds_Mondial_pour_le_Développement_des_Villes|FMDV]], [[UNDP]], and [[UNEP]].&lt;ref&gt;regions20.org/about-us/ccfla/&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8897">A '''coupled human–environment system''' (known also as a '''coupled human and natural system''', or '''CHANS''') characterizes the dynamical two-way interactions between human systems (e.g., economic, social) and natural (e.g., hydrologic, atmospheric, biological, geological) systems.&lt;ref&gt;  [https://www.nsf.gov/geo/ere/ereweb/fundlisting.cfm?09560946044805114F1D4B14474914  Environmental Resource and Education Funding Opportunities], National Science Foundation.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Marina11"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1890/0012-9623-92.2.218 |title=Research on Coupled Human and Natural Systems (CHANS): Approach, Challenges, and Strategies |journal=Bulletin of the Ecological Society of America |volume=92 |issue=2 |pages=218–28 |year=2011 |last1=Alberti |first1=Marina |last2=Asbjornsen |first2=Heidi |last3=Baker |first3=Lawrence A |last4=Brozovic |first4=Nicholas |last5=Drinkwater |first5=Laurie E |last6=Drzyzga |first6=Scott A |last7=Jantz |first7=Claire A |last8=Fragoso |first8=José |last9=Holland |first9=Daniel S |last10=Kohler |first10=Timothy (Tim) A |last11=Liu |first11=Jianguo (Jack) |last12=McConnell |first12=William J |last13=Maschner |first13=Herbert D.

As CHANS research is relatively new, it has not yet matured into a coherent field. Some research programs draw from, and build on, the perspectives developed in trans-discplinary fields such as [[human ecology]], [[ecological anthropology]], [[environmental geography]], [[ecological economics|economics]], as well as others. In contrast, other research programs aim to develop a more quantitative theoretic framework focusing on the development of analytical and numerical models, by building on theoretical advances in [[complex adaptive systems]], [[complexity economics]], [[dynamical system]]s theory, and the [[earth science]]s. To some extent, all CHANS programs recognize the need to move beyond traditional research methods developed in the social and natural sciences, as these are not sufficient to quantify the highly nonlinear dynamics often present in CHANS. Some research into CHANS emulates the more traditional research programs that tended to separate the social from the ecological sciences.&lt;ref name="Liu07"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1579/0044-7447(2007)36[639:chans]2.0.co;2 |jstor=25547831 |pmid=18240679 |title=Coupled Human and Natural Systems |journal=AMBIO: A Journal of the Human Environment |volume=36 |issue=8 |pages=639–49 |year=2007 |last1=Liu |first1=Jianguo |last2=Dietz |first2=Thomas |last3=Carpenter |first3=Stephen R |last4=Folke |first4=Carl |last5=Alberti |first5=Marina |last6=Redman |first6=Charles L |last7=Schneider |first7=Stephen H |last8=Ostrom |first8=Elinor |last9=Pell |first9=Alice N |last10=Lubchenco |first10=Jane |last11=Taylor |first11=William W |last12=Ouyang |first12=Zhiyun |last13=Deadman |first13=Peter |last14=Kratz |first14=Timothy |last15=Provencher |first15=William }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Liu07b"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1126/science.1144004 |pmid=17872436 |title=Complexity of Coupled Human and Natural Systems |journal=Science |volume=317 |issue=5844 |pages=1513–6 |year=2007 |last1=Liu |first1=J |last2=Dietz |first2=T |last3=Carpenter |first3=S.

==History==
The phrase "coupled human–environment systems" appears in the earlier literature (dating back to 1999) noting that social and natural systems are inseparable.&lt;ref name="Sheppard04"&gt;{{cite book | editor1-last=Sheppard | editor1-first=E. | editor2-last=McMaster | editor2-first=R.

'''Downtown Port of Spain''' is the central business district of [[Port of Spain, Trinidad and Tobago]]. The largest of the city's 7 commercial districts. The Downtown district of [[Port of Spain]] is also the oldest district of the city, between South Quay (to the south), Oxford Street (to the north), the St. Ann's River (to the east), and Richmond Street (to the west).
[[File:Christopherstatuepos.JPG|thumb|Christopher Columbus Square and water fountain, Independence Square East, Port of Spain, April 2009]]

==Woodford Square==
The heart of downtown is Woodford Square - formerly Brunswick Square (renamed in the 19th century for British Governor, Sir [[Ralph James Woodford]]). On its northern side are City Hall and the Hall of Justice, seat of the Supreme Court; on its western side is the Red House, seat of [[Parliament of Trinidad and Tobago|Parliament]]; the [[Anglican]] Holy Trinity Cathedral is on its south side, and on the block south-west of the square is the National Library. A number of government offices are located in the immediate vicinity, and the blocks north and west of the Red House are home to many lawyers' chambers. Another busy area in Port Of Spain is Independence Square, located closer to the waterfront and to most of the high rise structures of the city.

Woodford Square itself is a green oasis in the heart of the city, with a late-Victorian fountain and bandstand, trees, benches, and lawns. It has famously been the site of many political rallies over the decades; former Prime Minister [[Eric Williams]] gave many public lectures here, dubbing it "the University of Woodford Square", and near the eastern gate is a spot which has become Port of Spain's Speakers' Corner.

==Independence Square==
Two blocks south of Woodford Square is [[Independence Square (Port of Spain)|Independence Square]] (formerly Marine Square), which runs along the breadth of downtown Port of Spain from Wrightson Road to the west to the Roman Catholic [[Cathedral Basilica of the Immaculate Conception (Port of Spain)|Cathedral Basilica of the Immaculate Conception]] in the east. The section of the square immediately behind the cathedral is called Columbus Square. Before extensive land reclamation in the early 19th century, the city's shoreline ran through Independence Square.

In the early 1970s, illegal vendors who had set up shop in the middle of the square were evicted and major repaving and landscaping was undertaken. The new pedestrian area in the middle of the square was named the [[Brian Lara]] Promenade in honour of Trinidad and Tobago's star [[cricket]] batsman. Where Independence Square is bisected by Frederick Street there is a roundabout with a statue of Captain [[Arthur Andrew Cipriani|A.A. Cipriani]], the early 20th-century populist politician and mayor of the city. South of the square, Frederick Street widens and becomes Broadway, which terminates at the waterfront and the Port of Spain lighthouse, no longer used as a navigational aid but considered a major landmark. (For Trinidadians born and bred in Port of Spain or its northern and north-western suburbs, "past the lighthouse"—east of the lighthouse on the Beetham Highway—means outside the city proper.)

On the southern side of Independence Square are the twin towers of the [[Eric Williams Financial Complex]] (home of the Central Bank and the Ministry of Finance) and the new [[Nicholas Tower]], a commercial office building. Recently completed was the Richmond street Government Campus Plaza and the International Waterfront Centre Towers including the Hyatt Regency Hotel, with Towers C and D standing as the tallest buildings in Trinidad and Tobago and seventh and eighth tallest in the entire Caribbean region.

==Frederick Street==
Frederick Street, which runs north through the city to the Queen's Park Savannah, is Port of Spain's major avenue, connecting the two downtown squares with the uptown park, and very approximately dividing downtown into retail (east) and office (west) districts. One block east, lower Henry Street is the location of a number of shops selling cloth, mostly owned by members of Trinidad's [[Demographics of Syria|Syrian]]-[[Lebanese people|Lebanese]] community. Another block over, Charlotte Street at its lower end is Port of Spain's [[Chinatown]] in all but name, home to dozens of general emporia known for bargain shopping.

The '''draft''' or '''draught''' of a ship's [[Hull (watercraft)|hull]] is the vertical distance between the [[waterline]] and the bottom of the hull ([[keel]]), with the thickness of the hull included; in the case of not being included the draft outline would be obtained.  Draft determines the minimum depth of water a ship or boat can safely navigate. The draft can also be used to determine the weight of the cargo on board by calculating the total displacement of water and then using [[Archimedes' principle]]. A table made by the shipyard shows the water displacement for each draft. The density of the water (salt or fresh) and the content of the ship's [[Bunkering|bunkers]] has to be taken into account.  The closely related term "trim" is defined as the difference between the forward and aft drafts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history.navy.mil/research/library/online-reading-room/title-list-alphabetically/n/nomenclature-of-naval-vessels/glossary-of-shipbuilding-terms-s-z.html|title=Glossary of Shipbuilding Terms S-Z|publisher=US Navy Naval History and Heritage Command|accessdate=2015-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* The draft aft ([[stern]]) is measured in the [[Length between perpendiculars|perpendicular of the stern]].
* The draft forward ([[bow (ship)|bow]]) is measured in the perpendicular of the bow.
* The mean draft is obtained by calculating from the averaging of the stern and bow drafts, with correction for water level variation and value of the position of F{{what|date=October 2016}} with respect to the average perpendicular.{{fact|date=October 2016}}
* The trim of a ship is the difference between the forward and aft draft. When the aft draft is greater the vessel is deemed to have a negative trim, and it has a positive trim when the forward draft is the greater.&lt;ref name="derrett-1"&gt;{{cite book|last=Derrett|first=Captain D R|title=Ship Stability for Masters and Mates|year=2006|publisher=Elsevier|location=Sixth|pages=143–144|chapter=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; In such a case it is often referred to as being ''down-by-the-head''.

In commercial ship operations, the ship will usually quote the mean draft as the vessel's draft. However in navigational situations, the maximum draft, usually the aft draft, will be known on the bridge and will be shared with the [[maritime pilot|pilot]]. 

=== Variations ===
The draft of a ship can be affected by multiple factors, not considering the rise and fall of the ship by displacement:
* Variation by trim
* Variation by [[list (watercraft)|list]]
* Variation by [[sea level|water level]] change{{Clarify|date=March 2010}}
* Allowance of fresh water draft variation by passage from fresh to sea water or vice versa
* Heat variation in navigating shallow waters{{fact|date=October 2016}}
* Variation as a result of a ship moving in shallow waters, or [[squat effect|squat]]

== Draft scale ==
The drafts are measured with a "banded" scale, from bow and to stern, and for some ships, the average perpendicular measurement is  also used.  The scale may use traditional English units or metric units.  If the English system ([[Imperial units]]) is used, the bottom of each marking is the draft in feet and markings are 6 inches high.  In metric marking schemes, the bottom of each draft mark is the draft in [[decimeters]] and each mark is one decimeter high.

==Implications==

=== Large ships ===
Larger ships try to maintain an average water draft when they are light (without [[cargo]]), in order to make a better sea crossing and reduce the effects of the wind (high center of velic force). In order to achieve this they use [[sailing ballast]]s to stabilize the ship, following the unloading of cargo.

The water draft of a large ship has little direct link with its stability because stability depends solely on the respective positions of the [[metacenter]] of the hull and the center of gravity. It is also true, however, that a "light" ship has quite high stability which can lead to implying too much rolling of the ship (due to memory). A fully laden ship (with a large draft) can have either a strong or weak stability, depending upon the manner by which the ship is loaded (height of the [[center of gravity]]).

The draft of ships can be increased when the ship is in motion in shallow water, a phenomenon known as [[squat (shipping term)|squat]] (nautical term for the hydrodynamic effect of lower pressure pulling the ship down as it moves).

Draft is a significant factor limiting navigable waterways, especially for large vessels. This includes many shallow coastal waters and reefs, but also some major shipping lanes. [[Panamax]] class ships—the largest ships able to transit the [[Panama Canal]]—do have a draft limit (and an "air draft" limit for passing under bridges) but are usually limited by [[beam (nautical)|beam]], or sometimes [[length overall]],  for fitting into [[lock (water transport)|lock]]s. However, ships can be longer, wider and higher in the [[Suez Canal]], the limiting factor for [[Suezmax]] ships is draft. Some [[supertanker]]s are able to transit the Suez Canal when unladen or partially laden, but not when fully laden.

Canals are not the only draft-limited shipping lanes. A [[Malaccamax]] ship, is the deepest draft able to transit the very busy but relatively shallow [[Strait of Malacca]]. The Strait  only allows ships to have {{convert|.4|m|ft|abbr=on}} more draft than the Suez Canal. [[Capesize]], [[Ultra Large Crude Carrier]]s and a few [[Chinamax]] carriers, are some of the ships that have too deep a draft when laden, for either the Strait of Malacca or the Suez Canal.

=== Pleasure boats ===
A ''small draft'' allows [[pleasure boat]]s to navigate through shallower water. This makes it possible for these boats to access smaller ports, to travel along rivers and even to 'beach' the boat.

A ''large draft'' ensures a good level of stability in strong wind, as the center of gravity is lower (ballast over the keel of the boat). For example: Ballasts placed very low in the keel of a boat such as a [[dragon boat]] with a draft of 1.20 m for a length of 8.90 m.

A boat like a [[catamaran]] can mitigate the problem by retrieving good stability in a small draft, but the width of the boat increases.

=== Submarines ===
For [[submarines]], which can submerge to different depths at sea, a term called [[keel depth]] is used, specifying the current distance from the water surface to the bottom of the submarine's keel.  It is used in navigation to avoid underwater obstacles and hitting the ocean floor, and as a standard point on the submarine for depth measurements.

Submarines usually also have a specified draft used while operating on the surface, for navigating in harbors and at docks.

The '''geographical centre of Switzerland''' has the coordinates {{coord|46|48|4|N|8|13|36|E|type:landmark_region:CH-OW_source:dewiki|display=inline,title}} ([[Swiss Grid]]: 660158/183641). It is located at Älggi-Alp in the municipality of [[Sachseln]], [[Obwalden]]. The point is the [[center of mass|centre of mass]] determined in 1988 by [[Swisstopo]].

As the point is difficult to access, a stone was set 500 m further south-east on Älggi Alp (1645 m). This symbolizes the centre of Switzerland and is located at {{coord|46|47|54|N|8|13|55|E|type:landmark_region:CH-OW_source:dewiki|name=Marker for the geographic centre of Switzerland}} (Swiss Grid: 660557/183338). A plaque on the stone commemorates the winner of the "[[Swiss of the Year]]" award.

The '''Gerald Durrell Endemic Wildlife Sanctuary''' is an [[animal sanctuary]] founded in 1984, in Western [[Mauritius]]. It is an area closed off to the public, in the [[Black River District, Mauritius|Black River Gorge]] region, which is densely forested, and is used for breeding rare, [[endemic (ecology)|endemic]] Mauritian species. Among the endangered species in the sanctuary is the [[Indian Ocean kestrels|Mauritius kestrel]], once the rarest bird in the world with only 4 members left. It has been successfully bred and the population has now reached the capacity of Mauritius.

The sanctuary is named after [[natural history|naturalist]] [[Gerald Durrell]], who was associated with Mauritius' conservation movement from its inception in the 1970s, and who adopted the extinct Mauritian [[dodo]] as the logo for his ''Jersey Wildlife Preservation Trust'', now [[Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust]].

The sanctuary is run jointly by the  National Parks and Conservation Service  and [[Mauritian Wildlife Foundation]], with the help of the ''Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust''.

'''GpsDrive''' is a [[computer program]] designed to act as a [[vehicle]] [[navigation system]]. The program displays its user's position, obtained from an [[National Marine Electronics Association|NMEA]]-capable [[GPS]] receiver, on a [[digital zoom|zoomable]] [[map]] drawn on a [[computer screen]]. The map file is automatically selected depending on the position and preferred [[map scale|scale]].

Currently, GpsDrive uses [[raster graphics|raster images]] of maps, but plans for its development include the utilization of [[vector graphics|vector data]] from projects such as [[OpenStreetMap]]. Speech output is supported if [[Festival Speech Synthesis System|Festival software]] is running. GpsDrive is designed to work with all [[Garmin]] GPS receivers having a [[serial port]], as well as other GPS receivers with NMEA protocol support.

GpsDrive is written in [[C (programming language)|C]], with use of the [[GTK+]] graphical [[widget toolkit]], and runs on [[Linux]], [[FreeBSD]] and other [[Unix-like]] systems. It has interface support for different languages, such as [[English language|English]], [[German language|German]] and [[French language|French]]. It is available under the [[GNU General Public License]].

'''Hydroseeding''' (or hydraulic mulch seeding, hydro-mulching, hydraseeding) is a [[planting]] process that uses a [[slurry]] of [[seed]] and [[mulch]]. It is often used as an [[erosion control]] technique on construction sites, as an alternative to the traditional process of [[broadcast seeding|broadcasting]] or [[sowing]] dry seed.

==Description==
The hydroseeding slurry is transported in a tank, either truck-mounted or trailer-mounted and sprayed over prepared ground. [[Helicopter]]s have been used to cover larger areas. Aircraft application may also be used on burned [[wilderness]] areas [[Post fire seeding|after a fire]], and in such uses may contain only soil stabilizer to avoid introducing [[Introduced species|non-native plant]] species. Hydroseeding is an alternative to the traditional process of broadcasting or sowing dry seed. A study conducted along the lower [[Colorado River]] in Arizona, the United States found that hydroseeding could be used to restore riparian vegetation in cleared land.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=R.G. |last=Matthew |author2=A.M. Michael |author3=M.K. Martin |author4=E.R. Barbara |author5=M.G. Gregg |author6=P.B. Daniel |year=2011 |title=Direct seeding for riparian tree re-vegetation: Small-scale field study of seeding methods and irrigation techniques |journal=Ecological Engineering |volume=37 |pages=864–872}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The slurry often has other ingredients including [[fertilizer]], [[Tackifier|tackifying agents]], fiber mulch, and green dye.&lt;ref&gt;California Department of Transportation (CalTrans). Sacramento, CA. [http://www.dot.ca.gov/hq/construc/stormwater/CSBMPM_303_Final.pdf "Construction Site Best Management Practices (BMP) Manual."] Section 3, BMP No. SS-4. March 2003.
&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Originating back to the USA in the 1940s, Maurice Mandell from the Connecticut Highway Department discovered that by mixing seed and water together, the resulting mulch could be spread and sprayed over the steep and otherwise inaccessible slopes of the Connecticut expressways.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of Hydroseeding|url=https://oliverbrownltd.co.uk/hydroseeding/the-history-of-hydroseeding/|website=Oliver Brown Ltd|accessdate=25 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advantages==
If planting a relatively large area, hydroseeding &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tampalandscaping.org/lawncare-tips/ |title=Lawncare via. Hydroseeding |first=Owen |last=Cook |publisher=Tampa Landscaping |date=2016-05-04 |accessdate=2016-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; can be completed in a very short period of time. It can be very effective for hillsides and sloping lawns to help with erosion control and quick planting. Hydro seeding will typically cost less than planting with sod, but more than broadcast seeding. Results are often quick with high germination rates producing grass growth in about a week and mowing maintenance beginning around 3 to 4 weeks from the date of application. Fiber mulch accelerates the growing process by maintaining moisture around the seeds thereby increasing the rate of germination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.allaboutlawns.com/lawn-maintenance-care/planting-and-repair/planting-by-hydroseeding.php |title=Planting by Hydroseeding |first=Dawn |last=West |publisher=All About Lawns |date=2006-08-21 |accessdate=2013-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''ISO 3166-2:BR''' is the entry for [[Brazil]] in [[ISO 3166-2]], part of the [[ISO 3166]] [[standardization|standard]] published by the [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO), which defines [[code]]s for the names of the principal [[country subdivision|subdivision]]s (e.g. provinces or [[state (administrative division)|state]]s) of all [[country|countries]] coded in [[ISO 3166-1]].

Currently for Brazil, ISO 3166-2 codes are defined for [[states of Brazil|1 federal district and 26 states]]. The [[Federal District (Brazil)|Federal District]] contains the capital of the country [[Brasília]] and has special status equal to the states.

Each code consists of two parts, separated by a hyphen. The first part is {{mono|BR}}, the [[ISO 3166-1 alpha-2]] code of Brazil. The second part is two letters.

==Current codes==
Current (since 1975) subdivision names are listed as in the ISO 3166-2 standard published by the ISO 3166 Maintenance Agency (ISO 3166/MA).

== Previous codes ==
The usual reference year for "past" in ISO 3166-2:BR and similar controlled names is 1889, the year of [[Proclamation of the Republic (Brazil)|Proclamation of the Republic]].  In the "recent past" there were five additional codes and names:

* ''FN''	(territory of ''[[Fernando de Noronha]]''), from 1943 to 1946, merged into PE.
* ''GU''	(territory of ''Guaporé''), from 1943 to 1946, renamed to [[Rondônia]] (RO).
* ''PP''	(territory of ''[[Ponta Porã]]''), from 1943 to 1946, merged into MS.
* ''RB''	(''Rio Branco''), from 1943 to 1946, renamed to [[Roraima]] (RR).
* ''GB''	(''[[Guanabara (state)|Guanabara]]''), from 1960 to 1975, old DF, merged as city into RJ.

In its final shape, the deal places under permanent safeguards those nuclear facilities that India has identified as "civil" and permits broad civil nuclear cooperation, while excluding the transfer of "sensitive" equipment and technologies, including civil enrichment and reprocessing items even under IAEA safeguards.

The ''[[Henry J.

The 123 agreement defines the terms and conditions for bilateral civilian nuclear cooperation, and requires separate approvals by the [[United States Congress|U.S. Congress]] and by [[Cabinet of India|Indian cabinet]] ministers.

==Background==
Parties to the [[Non-Proliferation Treaty]] (NPT) have a recognized right of access to peaceful uses of nuclear energy and an obligation to cooperate on civilian nuclear technology.  Separately, the [[Nuclear Suppliers Group]] has agreed on guidelines for nuclear exports, including reactors and fuel.  Those guidelines condition such exports on comprehensive safeguards by the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]], which are designed to verify that nuclear energy is not diverted from peaceful use to weapons programs. Though neither India, Israel, nor Pakistan have signed the NPT, India argues that instead of addressing the central objective of universal and comprehensive non-proliferation, the treaty creates a club of "nuclear haves" and a larger group of "nuclear have-nots" by restricting the legal possession of nuclear weapons to those states that tested them before 1967, who alone are free to possess and multiply their nuclear stockpiles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

India insists on a comprehensive action plan for a nuclear-free world within a specific time-frame and has also adopted a voluntary "no first use policy".

Led by the U.S., other states have set up an informal group, the [[Nuclear Suppliers Group]] (NSG), to  control exports of nuclear materials, equipment and technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://fas.org/nuke/control/nsg/index.html|title=Nuclear Suppliers Group|website=Fas.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, India was left outside the international nuclear order, which forced India to develop its own resources for each stage of the nuclear fuel cycle and power generation, including next generation reactors such as fast [[breeder reactor]]s and a [[thorium]] breeder reactor&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ans.org/pubs/journals/nt/va-133-1-1-32|title=A Thorium Breeder Reactor|website=Ans.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rediff.com/news/2005/aug/25nuke.htm|title=India unveils 'world's safest nuclear reactor'|website=Rediff.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; known as the [[Advanced Heavy Water Reactor]]. In addition to impelling India to achieve success in developing these new reactor technologies, the sanctions also provided India with the impetus to continue developing [[India and weapons of mass destruction|its own nuclear weapons technology]] with a specific goal of achieving self-sufficiency for all key components for weapons design, testing and production.

Given that India is estimated to possess reserves of about 80,000–112,369 tons of [[uranium]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.carnegieendowment.org/files/atomsforwarfinal4.pdf|format=PDF|title=Atoms for War? U.S.-Indian Civilian Nuclear Cooperation and India's Nuclear Arsenal|page=18, paragraph 1|author=Tellis, Ashley}}&lt;/ref&gt;  India has more than enough fissile material to supply its nuclear weapons program, even if it restricted Plutonium production to only 8 of the country's 17 current reactors, and then further restricted Plutonium production to only 1/4 of the fuel core of these reactors.&lt;ref name="carnegieendowment1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.carnegieendowment.org/files/atomsforwarfinal4.pdf|format=PDF|title=Atoms for War? U.S.-Indian Civilian Nuclear Cooperation and India's Nuclear Arsenal|pages=31–36|author=Tellis, Ashley}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the calculations of one of the key advisers to the US Nuclear deal negotiating team, Ashley Tellis:&lt;ref name="carnegieendowment1"/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Operating India's eight unsafeguarded PHWRs in such a [conservative] regime would bequeath New Delhi with some 12,135–13,370 kilograms of weapons-grade plutonium, which is sufficient to produce between 2,023–2,228 nuclear weapons over and above those already existing in the Indian arsenal. Although no Indian analyst, let alone a policy maker, has ever advocated any nuclear inventory that even remotely approximates such numbers, this heuristic exercise confirms that New Delhi has the capability to produce a gigantic nuclear arsenal while subsisting well within the lowest estimates of its known uranium reserves.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, because the amount of nuclear fuel required for the electricity generation sector is far greater than that required to maintain a nuclear weapons program, and since India's estimated reserve of uranium represents only 1% of the world's known uranium reserves, the NSG's uranium export restrictions mainly affected Indian nuclear power generation capacity. Specifically, the NSG sanctions challenge India's long term plans to expand and fuel its civilian nuclear power generation capacity from its current output of about 4GWe  (GigaWatt electricity) to a power output of 20GWe by 2020; assuming the planned expansion used conventional Uranium/Plutonium fueled [[heavy water]] and light water nuclear power plants.

Consequently, India's nuclear isolation constrained expansion of its civil nuclear program, but left India relatively immune to foreign reactions to a prospective nuclear test. Partly for this reason, but mainly due to continued unchecked covert nuclear and missile proliferation activities between Pakistan, China&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2008-08-28-china_N.htm?csp=34 |title=Report says China offered widespread help on nukes | work=USA Today | first=Dan | last=Vergano | date=August 29, 2008 | accessdate=May 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt; India conducted five more [[Pokhran-II|nuclear tests]] in May 1998 at [[Pokhran]].

India was subject to international sanctions after its May 1998 nuclear tests. However, due to the size of the Indian economy and its relatively large domestic sector, these sanctions had little impact on India, with Indian GDP growth increasing from 4.8% in 1997–1998 (prior to sanctions) to 6.6% (during sanctions) in 1998–1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|ssrn=365440|title=Achieving 9% Growth Rate in India: A Growth Paradigm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, at the end of 2001, the Bush Administration decided to drop all sanctions on India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Rationale behind the agreement==

===Nuclear non-proliferation===
The proposed civil nuclear agreement implicitly recognizes India's "de facto" status even without signing the NPT. The [[George W. Bush administration|Bush administration]] justifies a nuclear pact with India arguing that it is important in helping to advance the non-proliferation framework&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.indianembassy.org/US_Media/2000/pm_us/Armed%20India%20Can%20Help%20Stabilize%20Asia.htm |title=Condoleezza Rice Paks a proliferation punch |date=July 26, 2008 |work=The Economic Times |location=India |accessdate=August 3, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081119070536/http://www.indianembassy.org/US_Media/2000/pm_us/Armed%20India%20Can%20Help%20Stabilize%20Asia.htm |archivedate=November 19, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; by formally recognizing India's strong non-proliferation record even though it has not signed the [[Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty|NPT]]. The former Under Secretary of State of Political Affairs, Nicholas Burns, one of the architects of the Indo-U.S. nuclear deal said "India's trust, its credibility, the fact that it has promised to create a state-of-the-art facility, monitored by the IAEA, to begin a new export control regime in place, because it has not proliferated the nuclear technology, we can't say that about Pakistan." when asked whether the U.S. would offer a nuclear deal with Pakistan on the lines of the Indo-U.S. deal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ptinews.com/pti%5Cptisite.nsf/0/A6E003D1001C996865257497004470D2?OpenDocument]{{Dead link|date=October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibnlive.com/news/russia-hints-at-smooth-sail-for-india-at-iaea/70099-3.html |title=Russia hints at smooth sail for India at IAEA |publisher=Ibnlive.com |accessdate=October 2, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070606225427/http://www.ipcs.org/countIssueBrief.jsp?issue=31 |title=Internet Archive's Wayback Machine |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=2007-06-06 |accessdate=2018-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Mohamed ElBaradei]], former head of the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]], which would be in charge of inspecting India's civilian reactors has praised the deal as "it would also bring India closer as an important partner in the nonproliferation regime".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

While some authors praised the agreement as bringing India closer to the NPT regime, others argued that it gave India too much leeway in determining which facilities were to be safeguarded and that it effectively rewarded India for continuously refusing to accede to the Non-Proliferation Treaty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Jörn | last=Müller | title=The Signing of the U.S.-India Agreement Concerning Peaceful Uses of Nuclear Energy | year=2009 | work=Göttingen Journal of International Law | url =http://gojil.uni-goettingen.de/ojs/index.php/gojil/article/view/26/M%C3%BCller2 | pages =179–198 | accessdate =April 5, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Economic considerations===
In India, the proponents of the agreement cite economic considerations as one of the topmost factors in their support of the agreement. For example, Indian scholar [[Rejaul Karim Laskar]] argues, "the most important significance of the deal for India (is) related to the contribution it will make in meeting India's energy requirements to sustain high rate of economic growth".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Laskar|first1=Rejaul Karim|title=Significance of Indo-US Nuclear Deal|agency=The Assam Tribune|date=November 20, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Financially, the U.S. also expects that such a deal could spur India's economic growth and bring in $150 billion in the next decade for nuclear power plants, of which the U.S. wants a share.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

===Nuclear technology===
[[Siegfried Hecker|Dr. Siegfried S. Hecker, PhD.]], former Director of the [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]], observed while testifying before a U.S. Senate Committee in 2008 that the United States might benefit from access to Indian nuclear technology: "I found that whereas sanctions slowed progress in nuclear energy, they made India self-sufficient and world leaders in fast reactor technologies. While much of the world's approach to India has been to limit its access to nuclear technology, it may well be that today we limit ourselves by not having access to India's nuclear technology developments. Such technical views should help to advice the diplomatic efforts with India."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.currentscience.ac.in/Volumes/110/02/0141.pdf|format=PDF|title=The Indo-US nuclear deal – a decade after|website=Currentscience.ac.in|accessdate=22 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Strategic===
Since the end of the [[Cold War]], [[The Pentagon]], along with certain U.S. ambassadors such as [[Robert Blackwill]], has requested increased strategic ties with India and a de-hyphenization of Pakistan with India, i.e. having separate policies toward India and Pakistan rather than just an "India-Pakistan" policy. The United States also sees India as a viable counter-weight to the growing influence of China,{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} and a potential client and job creator.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

Indian opposition to the pact centers on the concessions that would need to be made, as well as the likely de-prioritization of research into a [[thorium fuel cycle]] if [[uranium]] becomes highly available given the well understood utilization of uranium in a [[nuclear fuel cycle]].

==Passing of Agreement==
On March 2, 2006 in New Delhi, [[George W. Bush]] and [[Manmohan Singh]] signed a Civil Nuclear Cooperation Agreement, following an initiation during the July 2005 summit in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]] between the two leaders over civilian nuclear cooperation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://usinfo.state.gov/sa/Archive/2006/Mar/02-806725.html |publisher=USINFO – International Information Programs |title=Bush, India's Singh Sign Civil Nuclear Cooperation Agreement |accessdate=March 2, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060306172637/http://usinfo.state.gov/sa/Archive/2006/Mar/02-806725.html |archivedate=March 6, 2006 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Heavily endorsed by the [[White House]], the agreement is thought to be a major victory to [[George W. Bush]]'s foreign policy initiative and was described by many lawmakers as a cornerstone of the new strategic partnership between the two countries.&lt;ref name="All info above"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.hindu.com/2006/07/28/stories/2006072812290100.htm|title=U.S. House votes for nuclear deal|work=The Hindu |accessdate=July 29, 2006|location=Chennai, India|date=July 28, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 3, 2007, both the countries released the full text of the 123 agreement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2007/aug/90050.htm |title = U.S. and India Release Text of 123 Agreement |accessdate =July 11, 2008 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080709111810/http://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2007/aug/90050.htm |archivedate = July 9, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nicholas Burns, the chief negotiator of the India-United States nuclear deal, said the U.S. has the right to terminate the deal if India tests a nuclear weapon and that no part of the agreement recognizes India as a nuclear weapons state (which would be contrary to the NPT).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rediff.com/news/2008/jul/31ndeal2.htm|title=US can terminate N-deal if India conducts tests|website=Rediff.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hyde Act Passage in the U.S.==
On December 18, 2006 President George W. Bush signed the Hyde Act into law.  The Act was passed by an overwhelming 359–68 in the [[United States House of Representatives]] on July 26 and by 85–12 in the [[United States Senate]] on November 16 in a strong show of bipartisan support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.america.gov/st/washfile-english/2006/November/20061117171748idybeekcm0.2382471.html |title=Bush Welcomes Senate Approval of U.S.-India Nuclear Agreement |publisher=USINFO – International Information Programs |accessdate=November 17, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080115015309/http://www.america.gov/st/washfile-english/2006/November/20061117171748idybeekcm0.2382471.html |archivedate=January 15, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.govtrack.us/congress/vote.xpd?vote=h2006-411|title=H.R. 5682: House Vote 411: Jul 26, 2006 (109th Congress)|publisher=GovTrack|accessdate=July 26, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.govtrack.us/congress/vote.xpd?vote=s2006-270|title=H.R. 5682: Senate Vote 270: Nov 16, 2006 (109th Congress)|publisher=GovTrack|accessdate=November 16, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The House version ([[#See also|H.R. 5682]]) and Senate version ([[#See also|S. 3709]]) of the bill differed due to amendments each had added before approving, but the versions were reconciled with a House vote of 330–59 on December 8 and a Senate voice-vote on December 9 before being passed on to President G.W.

In response to the language Congress used in the Act to define U.S. policy toward India, President Bush, stated "Given the Constitution's commitment to the authority of the presidency to conduct the nation's foreign affairs, the executive branch shall construe such policy statements as advisory," going on to cite sections 103 and 104 (d) (2) of the bill.  To assure Congress that its work would not be totally discarded, Bush continued by saying that the executive would give "the due weight that comity between the legislative and executive branches should require, to the extent consistent with U.S. foreign policy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibnlive.com/news/bush-seeks-to-allay-indias-concerns-over-ndeal/28903-3.html|title=Hyde Act not binding, says Bush|publisher=CNN-IBN|accessdate=December 19, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political opposition in India==
{{Main|Opposition to the Indo-US civilian agreement in India}}
The Indo-US civilian nuclear agreement was met with stiff opposition by some political parties and activists in India. Although many mainstream political parties including the [[Congress(I)]] supported the deal along with regional parties like [[Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam]] and [[Rashtriya Janata Dal]] its realization ran into difficulties in the face of stiff political opposition in India. Also, in November 2007, former Indian Military chiefs, bureaucrats and scientists drafted a letter to Members of Parliament expressing their support for the deal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.indianexpress.com/story/239308._.html |title = 'The question is can we get a better n-deal? No&amp;#x2019 |accessdate = July 11, 2008 |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080219052214/http://www.indianexpress.com/story/239308._.html |archivedate = February 19, 2008 |df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, opposition and criticism continued at political levels. The [[Samajwadi Party]] (SP) which was with the [[Left Front (West Bengal)|Left Front]] in opposing the deal changed its stand after discussing with ex-president of India and scientist Dr [[A. P. J. Abdul Kalam]]. The SP then supported the government and the deal. The Indian Government survived a vote of confidence by 275–256 after the Left Front withdrew their support to the government over this dispute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/7519860.stm |title=Indian government survives vote |date=July 22, 2008 |work=BBC News |accessdate=November 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Incidentally, results showed ten MPs belonging to the opposing [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] (BJP) cross-voting in the favor of the government.

As details were revealed about serious inconsistencies between what the Indian parliament was told about the deal, and the facts about the agreement that were presented by the Bush administration to the US Congress, opposition grew in India against the deal. In particular,  portions of the agreement dealing with guaranteeing India a fuel supply or allowing India to maintain a strategic reserve of nuclear fuel appear to be diametrically opposed to what the Indian parliament was led to expect from the agreement:
Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's statement in parliament is totally at variance with the Bush Administration's communication to the House Foreign Affairs Committee, which says India will not be allowed to stockpile such nuclear fuel stocks as to undercut American leverage to re-impose sanctions. To drive home this point, it says the 123 Agreement is not inconsistent with the Hyde Act's stipulation—the little-known 'Barack Obama Amendment' – that the supply of nuclear fuel should be "commensurate with reasonable operating requirements". The 'strategic reserve' that is crucial to India's nuclear program is, therefore, a non-starter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailypioneer.com/columnist1.asp?main_variable=Columnist&amp;file_name=KANCHAN196.txt&amp;writer=KANCHAN&amp;validit=yes |title=The Pioneer &gt; Columnists |website=The Pioneer |location=India |accessdate=October 2, 2008 }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, the agreement, as a result of its compliance with the Hyde Act, contained a direct linkage between shutting down US nuclear trade with India and any potential future Indian nuclear weapons test, a point that was factually inconsistent with explicit reassurances made on this subject by Prime Minister, Manmohan Singh, during final parliamentary debate on the nuclear deal. As professor Brahma Chellaney, an expert in strategic affairs and one of the authors of the Indian Nuclear Doctrine,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://us.rediff.com/news/2006/apr/27brahma.htm?zcc=rl |title=Brahma Chellaney a strategic affairs expert, is a professor at the Centre for Policy Research. He was one of the authors of the nuclear doctrine submitted to the government for finalisation |publisher=rediff.com |accessdate=October 10, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; explained:

&lt;blockquote&gt;While the Hyde Act's bar on Indian testing is explicit, the one in the NSG waiver is implicit, yet unmistakable. The NSG waiver is overtly anchored in NSG Guidelines Paragraph 16, which deals with the consequence of "an explosion of a nuclear device". The waiver's Section 3(e) refers to this key paragraph, which allows a supplier to call for a special NSG meeting, and seek termination of cooperation, in the event of a test or any other "violation of a supplier-recipient understanding". The recently leaked Bush administration letter to Congress has cited how this Paragraph 16 rule will effectively bind India to the Hyde Act's conditions on the pain of a U.S.-sponsored cut-off of all multilateral cooperation. India will not be able to escape from the U.S.-set conditions by turning to other suppliers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chellaney.spaces.live.com/blog/cns!4913C7C8A2EA4A30!788.entry |title=Stagecraft and Statecraft&amp;#58; India&amp;#39;s retarded nuclear deterrent |publisher=Chellaney.spaces.live.com |accessdate=2008-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Indian parliament vote==
{{Further|2008 Lok Sabha vote of confidence|Notes-for-Vote scandal}}

On July 8, 2008, [[Prakash Karat]] announced that the Left Front is withdrawing its support to the government over the decision by the government to go ahead on the United States-India Peaceful Atomic Energy Cooperation Act. The left front had been a staunch advocate of not proceeding with this deal citing national interests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/thehindu/holnus/000200807081440.htm |title=Left to withdraw support to UPA govt |work=The Hindu |accessdate=July 11, 2008 |location=Chennai, India |date=July 8, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080802233559/http://www.hindu.com/thehindu/holnus/000200807081440.htm |archivedate=August 2, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 22, 2008 the UPA faced its first [[confidence vote]] in the [[Lok Sabha]] after the [[Communist Party of India (Marxist)]] led Left Front withdrew support over India approaching the IAEA for Indo-U.S. nuclear deal.

===Versions of U.S. draft exemption===
On August 2008 U.S. draft exemption would have granted India a waiver based on the "steps that India has taken voluntarily as a contributing partner in the non-proliferation regime".&lt;ref name=AugWaiver&gt;{{cite web|url=https://carnegieendowment.org/2008/08/13/text-of-u.s.-nsg-proposal-on-india-pub-20388|title=Text of U.S. NSG Proposal on India|website=Carnegie Endowment for International Peace}}&lt;/ref&gt; Based on these steps, and without further conditions, the draft waiver would have allowed for the transfer to India of both trigger list and dual-use items (including technology), waiving the full-scope safeguards requirements of the NSG guidelines.&lt;ref name=NSGGuidelines&gt;[http://www.nuclearsuppliersgroup.org/guide.htm NSG Guidelines] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080914031411/http://www.nuclearsuppliersgroup.org/guide.htm |date=September 14, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bharatiya Janata Party]]'s [[Yashwant Sinha]], who also formerly held the post of India's External Affairs Minister, criticized the Indian government's decision to seek NSG's consensus and remarked that "India has walked into the non-proliferation trap set by the U.S., we have given up our right to test nuclear weapons forever, it has been surrendered by the government".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gulf-daily-news.com/Story.asp?Article=228340&amp;Sn=WORL&amp;IssueID=31171 |title=India nuclear deal rift ends|website=Gulf Daily News |accessdate=October 2, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, another prominent member of the same party and India's former National Security Advisor [[Brajesh Mishra]] supported the development at the NSG and said that the waiver granted made "no prohibition" on India to conduct nuclear tests in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/2008/09/07/stories/2008090754040800.htm |title=Advantage India, says Brajesh Mishra |work=The Hindu |date= September 7, 2008|accessdate=October 2, 2008 |location=Chennai, India}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Abdul Kalam]], also supported the agreement and remarked that New Delhi may break its "voluntary moratorium" on further nuclear tests in "supreme national interest".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hindustantimes.com/StoryPage/StoryPage.aspx?sectionName=&amp;id=5b7b567b-3824-47c4-908c-34d9469a8afc&amp;&amp;Headline='N-deal,%20NSG%20waiver%20good%20for%20country'&amp;strParent=strParentID]{{dead link|date=July 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} ''Hindustan Times''&lt;/ref&gt; However, analyst M K Bhadrakumar demurred. He said that the consensus at NSG was achieved on the "basis" of Pranab Mukherjee's commitment to India's voluntary moratorium on nuclear testing and by doing so, India has entered into a "multilateral commitment" bringing it within "the ambit of the CTBT and NPT".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/South_Asia/JI09Df02.html |title=Hindu gods spike Chinese dragon | author=M K Bhadrakumar|publisher=Atimes.com |accessdate=October 2, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The NSG consensus was welcomed by several major Indian companies. Major Indian corporations like [[Videocon Group]], [[Tata Power]] and [[Jindal Power]] saw a US$40 billion nuclear energy market in India in the next 10–15 years.&lt;ref name="economictimes1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/India_Inc_eyes_on_40_bn_nuclear_energy_mkt/articleshow/3460143.cms |title=India Inc sets eyes on $40 bn nuclear energy market |work=Economictimes.indiatimes.com |date=September 9, 2008 |accessdate=October 2, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080915232309/http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/India_Inc_eyes_on_40_bn_nuclear_energy_mkt/articleshow/3460143.cms |archivedate=September 15, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On a more optimistic note, some of India's largest and most well-respected corporations like [[Bharat Heavy Electricals Limited]], [[National Thermal Power Corporation]] and [[Larsen &amp; Toubro]] were eyeing a $100 billion (U.S.) business in this sector over the same time period.&lt;ref name="economictimes1"/&gt; According to ''Hindustan Times'', nuclear energy will produce 52,000 MW of electricity in India by 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2008-09-11/india/27937174_1_nuclear-power-reactors-atomic-power-plants |title=N-trade: It's a $40 billion opportunity |work=The Times of India |date= September 11, 2008|accessdate=October 2, 2008 |first1=Srinivas |last1=Laxman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other reactions over the issue===
More than 150 non-proliferation activists and anti-nuclear organizations called for tightening the initial NSG agreement to prevent harming the current global non-proliferation regime.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hindu.com/2008/08/16/stories/2008081660021200.htm "Tighten draft waiver for India"] ''The Hindu''&lt;/ref&gt; Among the steps called for were:&lt;ref name=ACALett&gt;[http://www.armscontrol.org/system/files/NSGLetterGermanyAug15.pdf "Decision Time on the Indian Nuclear Deal: Help Avert a Nonproliferation Disaster"] Arms Control Association&lt;/ref&gt;
*ceasing cooperation if India conducts nuclear tests or withdraws from safeguards
*supplying only an amount of fuel which is commensurate with ordinary reactor operating requirements
*expressly prohibiting the transfer of enrichment, reprocessing, and heavy water production items to India
*opposing any special safeguards exemptions for India
*conditioning the waiver on India stopping fissile production and legally binding itself not to conduct nuclear tests
*not allowing India to reprocess nuclear fuel supplied by a member state in a facility that is not under permanent and unconditional IAEA safeguards
*agreeing that all bilateral nuclear cooperation agreements between an NSG member-state and India explicitly prohibit the replication or use of such technology in any unsafeguarded Indian facilities
The call said that the draft Indian nuclear "deal would be a nonproliferation disaster and a serious setback to the prospects of global nuclear disarmament" and also pushed for all world leaders who are serious about ending the arms race "to stand up and be counted."&lt;ref name=ACALett /&gt;

Dr. [[Kaveh L. Afrasiabi]], who has taught political science at [[Tehran University]], has argued the agreement will set a new precedent for other states, adding that the agreement represents a diplomatic boon for Tehran.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Middle_East/JH05Ak01.html|title=Asia Times Online :: Middle East News, Iraq, Iran current affairs|website=Atimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ali Ashgar Soltanieh, the Iranian Deputy Director General for International and Political Affairs,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brad.ac.uk/acad/sbtwc/btwc/new_process/mx2004/statements/iran-E.pdf] {{dead link|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; has complained the agreement may undermine the credibility, integrity and universality of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. Pakistan argues the safeguards agreement "threatens to increase the chances of a nuclear arms race in the subcontinent."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.forbes.com/feeds/ap/2008/08/01/ap5280729.html "India moves a step closer to U.S. nuclear pact"] ''Forbes''&lt;/ref&gt; Pakistani Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi has suggested his country should be considered for such an accord,&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2008-07-24/india/27909769_1_safeguards-pact-iaea-board-arms-race "India dismisses Pak talk of arms race due to N-deal"] Press Trust of India ''Times of India'' (July 24, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; and Pakistan has also said the same process "should be available as a model for other non-NPT states".&lt;ref&gt;[http://verificationthoughts.googlepages.com/UN1908India.pdf Permanent Mission of Pakistan to the International Organizations (July 2008): Letter from Pakistan to the IAEA Board of Governors and Nuclear Suppliers Group] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080909190800/http://verificationthoughts.googlepages.com/UN1908India.pdf |date=September 9, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 19, 2010, U.S. Secretary of State [[Hillary Clinton]] countered Pakistan statements by saying that Pakistan's checkered history on nuclear proliferation "raises red flags" regarding nuclear cooperation with Pakistan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tvnz.co.nz/world-news/clinton-woos-pakistan-security-aid-3651555 "Clinton woos Pakistan on security, aid"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100810232415/http://tvnz.co.nz/world-news/clinton-woos-pakistan-security-aid-3651555 |date=August 10, 2010 }}, Reuters, July 19, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Israel is citing the Indo-U.S. civil nuclear deal as a precedent to alter Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG) rules to construct its first nuclear power plant in the Negev desert, and is also pushing for its own trade exemptions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hindustantimes.com/storypage/storypage.aspx?sectionName=&amp;id=9a7f3e9c-db05-4333-beb1-ccece17c6658&amp;&amp;Headline=Now%2c+Israel+wants+NSG+rules+changed&amp;strParent=strParentID "Now, Israel wants NSG rules changed"]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080922211657/http://www.hindustantimes.com/storypage/storypage.aspx?sectionName=&amp;id=9a7f3e9c-db05-4333-beb1-ccece17c6658&amp;&amp;Headline=Now%2C+Israel+wants+NSG+rules+changed&amp;strParent=strParentID |date=September 22, 2008 }} ''Hindustan Times''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Brahma Chellaney]], a Professor of Strategic Studies at the New Delhi-based Centre for Policy Research, argued that the wording of the U.S. exemption sought to irrevocably tether New Delhi to the nuclear non-proliferation regime. He argued India would be brought under a wider non-proliferation net, with India being tied to compliance with the entire set of NSG rules.  India would acquiesce to its unilateral test moratorium being turned into a multilateral legality. He concluded that instead of the "full" civil nuclear cooperation that the original July 18, 2005, deal promised, India's access to civil nuclear enrichment and reprocessing technologies would be restricted through the initial NSG waiver.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://in.rediff.com/news/2008/aug/15brahma.htm |title=Serious implications for India in NSG draft |publisher=In.rediff.com |accessdate=October 2, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081207210502/http://in.rediff.com/news/2008/aug/15brahma.htm |archivedate=December 7, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Consideration by U.S. Congress==
The Bush Administration told Congress in January 2008 that the United States may cease all cooperation with India if India detonates a nuclear explosive device. The Administration further said it was not its intention to assist India in the design, construction, or operation of sensitive nuclear technologies through the transfer of dual-use items.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indianexpress.com/story/356926.html "Was India misled by America on nuclear deal?"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080910011419/http://www.indianexpress.com/story/356926.html |date=September 10, 2008 }} ''Indian Express''&lt;/ref&gt; The statements were considered sensitive in India because debate over the agreement in India could have toppled the government of Prime Minister [[Manmohan Singh]]. The State Department had requested they remain secret even though they were not classified.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/09/02/AR2008090202733.html?hpid=moreheadlines "In Secret Letter, Tough U.S. Line on India Nuclear Deal"] ''Washington Post''&lt;/ref&gt; Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice also previously told the House Foreign Affairs Panel in public testimony that any agreement would "have to be completely consistent with the obligations of the Hyde Act".&lt;ref name=Rice&gt;[http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/PoliticsNation/Hyde_Act_will_haunt_nuclear_deal/articleshow/2783566.cms "Hyde Act will haunt nuclear deal at NSG too"] ''Economic Times of India''&lt;/ref&gt; [[Assistant Secretary of State for South and Central Asian Affairs]] [[Richard Boucher]] and the Former Assistant Secretary of State for Legislative Affairs [[Jeffrey Bergner]] also said the agreement would be in conformity with the Hyde Act.&lt;ref name=StateCongDisc&gt;[http://www.hcfa.house.gov/110/press090208.pdf Department of State: Answers to questions about Indo-U.S. nuclear agreement] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080904052644/http://www.hcfa.house.gov/110/press090208.pdf |date=September 4, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Howard Berman]], chair of the [[United States House Committee on Foreign Affairs|U.S. House Foreign Affairs Committee]], in a letter to U.S. Secretary of State [[Condoleezza Rice]] warned that an NSG waiver "inconsistent" with the 2006 Hyde Act would "jeopardise" the Indo-U.S. nuclear deal in the U.S. Congress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/thehindu/holnus/000200808080309.htm |location=Chennai, India |work=The Hindu |title=N-deal will be consistent with US domestic law |date=August 8, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080810132239/http://www.hindu.com/thehindu/holnus/000200808080309.htm |archivedate=August 10, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Edward J. Markey, co-chairman of the House Bipartisan Task Force on Non-proliferation, said that there needed to be clear consequences if India broke its commitments or resumed nuclear testing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/News/PoliticsNation/Congressional_approval_may_not_be_automatic_dissenters_speak_out/articleshow/3454548.cms "Congressional approval may not be automatic; dissenters speak out"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080910092909/http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/News/PoliticsNation/Congressional_approval_may_not_be_automatic_dissenters_speak_out/articleshow/3454548.cms |date=September 10, 2008 }} ''Economic Times of India''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Passage in Congress===
On September 28, 2008 the US House of Representatives voted 298–117 to approve the Indo-US nuclear deal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2008-09-28/india/27904104_1_nuclear-trade-nuclear-material-and-technology-indo-us-nuclear-deal "US House approves Indo-US nuke deal"] ''Times of India''&lt;/ref&gt; On October 1, 2008 the US Senate voted 86–13 to approve the Indo-US nuclear deal.&lt;ref name=BloomSenate&gt;[https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601091&amp;sid=a7dN2SDjU0ok&amp;refer=india "Bush Wins Approval in Congress for Priority India Atomic Accord"]{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} ''Bloomberg''&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Arms Control Association]] said the agreement fails to make clear that an Indian nuclear test would prompt the U.S. to cease nuclear trade;&lt;ref name=BloomSenate /&gt; however, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said that any nuclear test by India would result in the "most serious consequences," including automatic cut-off of U.S. cooperation as well as a number of other sanctions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hindu.com/2008/10/02/stories/2008100258820100.htm "Nuclear test will have serious consequences"] ''The Hindu''&lt;/ref&gt;

After Senate approval, US President George W. Bush said the deal would "strengthen our global nuclear nonproliferation efforts, protect the environment, create jobs, and assist India in meeting its growing energy needs in a responsible manner."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/Bush_hails_senate_passage_of_Indo-US_nuclear_deal/articleshow/3551793.cms |title=Bush hails Senate passage of Indo-US nuclear deal |work=The Times of India |accessdate=October 2, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090116182223/http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/Bush_hails_senate_passage_of_Indo-US_nuclear_deal/articleshow/3551793.cms |archivedate=January 16, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Then-US presidential candidates [[Barack Obama]] and [[John McCain]], as well as then-Vice Presidential candidate [[Joe Biden]], voted in support of the bill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/10/02/us.india.nuclear/index.html|title=Rice hails approval of India nuclear deal - CNN.com|website=Cnn.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Formal signing of the deal==
There was speculation the Indo-US deal would be signed on October 4, 2008 when U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice was in India. The deal was to be inked by Indian External Affairs Minister Pranab Mukherjee and U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice. The two leaders were to sign the deal at 2&amp;nbsp;pm at the Hyderabad House in New Delhi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deccanherald.com/Content/Oct42008/scroll2008100493498.asp?section=frontpagenews |title=N-deal faces last-minute glitch |website=Deccan Harald |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081206151557/http://www.deccanherald.com/Content/Oct42008/scroll2008100493498.asp?section=frontpagenews |archivedate=December 6, 2008 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; But Mr. Mukherjee announced that India would wait for the U.S. President to sign the 123 agreement legislation first into law and address India's concerns on fuel supply guarantees and the legal standing of the 123 agreement in the accompanying signing statement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/News/PoliticsNation/Condoleezza_Rice_leaves_without_inking_deal/articleshow/3561357.cms |title=Condoleezza Rice leaves without inking deal |work=Economic Times |location=India | date=October 5, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ms Rice was aware of the Indian decision before she left Washington. But she was very hopeful that the deal would be signed as the U.S. State Department had said that the President's signature was not prerequisite for Rice to ink the deal.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2008-10-05/india/27927688_1_pranab-mukherjee-honour-signature | work=Times of India|title=Rice is here but deal still not on table |date=October 5, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rice had earlier said that there were still a number of administrative details to be worked out even as she insisted that the US would abide by the Hyde Act on the testing issue:
[[File:Rice-Mukherjee sign US-India Civilian Nuclear Cooperation Agreement.jpg|thumb|left|220px|Secretary Rice and Indian Minister for External Affairs Pranab Mukherjee after signing the 123 agreement in Washington on October 10, 2008]]

&lt;blockquote&gt;There are a lot of administrative details that have to be worked out. This (the deal) was only passed in our Congress two days ago. The President is looking forward to signing the bill, sometime, I hope, very soon, because we'll want to use it as an opportunity to thank all of the people who have been involved in this", said Rice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ndtv.com/convergence/ndtv/story.aspx?id=NEWEN20080067616&amp;ch=10/4/2008%2012:00:00%20PM |title=Rice arrives, nuclear deal not to be signed today |publisher=NDTV.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081210114250/http://www.ndtv.com/convergence/ndtv/story.aspx?id=NEWEN20080067616&amp;ch=10%2F4%2F2008%2012%3A00%3A00%20PM |archivedate=December 10, 2008 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In Washington, a Senate Democratic aide said that such a delay was not that unusual because legislation needed to be carefully reviewed before being sent to the White House.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= https://www.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idUSTRE4930E420081004 |title=Rice in India, may not sign nuclear deal |agency=Reuters | date=October 4, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

US President George W. Bush signed the legislation on the Indo-US nuclear deal into law on October 8.&lt;ref name="whitehouse"/&gt; The new law, called the '''United States-India Nuclear Cooperation Approval and Non-proliferation Enhancement Act''', was signed by President Bush at a brief White House function in the presence of the Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, Energy Secretary Samuel Bodman, Vice-President Dick Cheney and the Indian Ambassador to the U.S. Ronen Sen besides a large gathering of other dignitaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/2008/10/10/stories/2008101060940100.htm |title=Bush signs India-U.S. nuclear bill into law |work=The Hindu  |date=October 10, 2008 |accessdate=October 13, 2008 |location=Chennai, India}}&lt;/ref&gt; The final administrative aspect of the deal was completed after Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and External Affairs Minister Pranab Mukherjee signed the bilateral instruments of the 123 Agreement in Washington on October 10 paving the way for operationalization of the deal between the two countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=David |last=Gollust |title=US, India Sign Civilian Nuclear Accord |date=October 10, 2008 |publisher=Voice of America |url=http://www.voanews.com/english/archive/2008-10/2008-10-10-voa66.cfm |accessdate=December 24, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090703160008/http://www.voanews.com/english/archive/2008-10/2008-10-10-voa66.cfm |archivedate=July 3, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''interplanetary magnetic field''' ('''IMF'''), now more commonly referred to as the heliospheric magnetic field (HMF),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Owens|first=Mathew J.|last2=Forsyth|first2=Robert J.|date=2013-11-28|title=The Heliospheric Magnetic Field|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.12942/lrsp-2013-5|journal=Living Reviews in Solar Physics|language=en|volume=10|issue=1|pages=5|doi=10.12942/lrsp-2013-5|issn=2367-3648|bibcode = 2013LRSP...10....5O }}&lt;/ref&gt; is the component of the [[solar magnetic field]] which is dragged out from the solar corona by the [[solar wind]] flow to fill the [[Solar System]].
[[Image:Heliospheric-current-sheet.gif|thumb|200px|The [[heliospheric current sheet]] is a three-dimensional form of a Parker spiral that results from the influence of the [[Sun]]'s [[rotating magnetic field]] on the [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] in the [[interplanetary medium]].&lt;ref&gt;http://wso.stanford.edu/gifs/helio.gif&lt;/ref&gt;]]

==Coronal and solar wind plasma==
The [[corona]]l and solar wind [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]]s are highly [[Conductor (material)|electrically conductive]], meaning the [[Magnetic field|magnetic field line]]s and the plasma flows are [[Alfvén's Theorem|effectively "frozen" together]] and the magnetic field cannot [[Diffusion|diffuse]] through the plasma on time scales of interest. In the solar corona, the magnetic pressure greatly exceeds the plasma pressure and thus [[Coronal loop|the plasma is primarily structured and confined by the magnetic field]]. With increasing altitude through the corona, solar wind acceleration results in the flow momentum exceeding the restraining [[magnetic tension force]] and the coronal magnetic field is dragged out by the solar wind to form the HMF.

The dynamic [[pressure]] of the wind dominates over the [[magnetic pressure]] through most of the Solar System (or [[heliosphere]]), so that the magnetic field is pulled into an [[Archimedean spiral]] pattern (the [[Parker spiral]]&lt;ref&gt;Parker, E. N., "[http://cdsads.u-strasbg.fr/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?1958ApJ...128..664P Dynamics of the Interplanetary Gas and Magnetic Fields]", (1958) ''Astrophysical Journal'', vol. 128, p.664&lt;/ref&gt;) by the combination of the outward motion and the [[solar rotation|Sun's rotation]].  In near-Earth space, the IMF nominally makes an angle of approximately 45° to the Earth-Sun line, though this angle varies with solar wind speed. The angle of the IMF to the radial direction reduces with helio-latitude, as the speed of the photospheric foot point is reduced.

Depending on the polarity of the photospheric foot point, the heliospheric magnetic field spirals inward or outward; the magnetic field follows the same shape of spiral in the northern and southern parts of the heliosphere, but with opposite field direction.  These two magnetic domains are separated by a two [[current sheet]] (an [[electric current]] that is confined to a curved plane).  This [[heliospheric current sheet]] has a shape similar to a twirled [[ballerina]] skirt, and changes in shape through the solar cycle as the Sun's magnetic field reverses about every 11 years.

==Magnetic field at the Earth==
[[File:Animati3.gif|thumb|155px|A video simulation of Earth's magnetic field interacting with the (solar) interplanetary magnetic field (IMF)]]
The [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] in the [[interplanetary medium]] is also responsible for the strength of the Sun's magnetic field at the orbit of the Earth being over 100 times greater than originally anticipated. If space were a vacuum, then the Sun's magnetic dipole field, about 10&lt;sup&gt;−4&lt;/sup&gt; [[Tesla (unit)|teslas]] at the surface of the Sun, would reduce with the inverse cube of the distance to about 10&lt;sup&gt;−11&lt;/sup&gt; teslas. But satellite observations show that it is about 100 times greater at around 10&lt;sup&gt;−9&lt;/sup&gt; teslas. [[Magnetohydrodynamic]] (MHD) theory predicts that the motion of a conducting fluid (e.g. the interplanetary medium) in a magnetic field, induces electric currents which in turn generates magnetic fields, and in this respect it behaves like a [[MHD dynamo]].

'''Jengish Chokusu''' ({{lang-ky|Жеңиш чокусу}}, ''Ceñiş çoqusu'', جەڭىش چوقۇسۇ {{IPA-ky|dʒeŋiʃ tʃoqusú|}}; {{lang-ru|Пик Победы}}, ''Pik Pobedy'' {{IPA-ru|pʲik pɐˈbʲɛdɨ|}}) is the highest [[mountain]] in the [[Tian Shan]] mountain system at {{convert|7439|m|ft|0}}. It lies on the [[Kyrgyzstan]]–[[China]] border between 
[[Ak-Suu District|the raion of Ak-Suu]], in the [[Issyk-Kul Region]] of far eastern Kyrgyzstan and [[Wensu County]], [[Xinjiang]], China. It is part of the [[Kakshaal Too]], the highest part of the Tien Shan, and located southeast of lake [[Issyk Kul]].

== Names ==
The mountain's official name in [[Kyrgyz language|Kyrgyz]] is ''Jengish Choqusu'', which means "Victory Peak"; its [[Russian language|Russian]] name is '''''Pik Pobedy''''' (or Peak Pobeda) meaning the same. In [[Uighur language|Uyghur]], it is called '''''Tömür''''', which is also the official name of the mountain in China. The [[Chinese language|Chinese]] name '''''Tuōmù'ěr Fēng''''' ({{zh|s=托木尔峰|t=托木爾峰}}) is a combination of the Uighur ''tomur'',  meaning 'iron' and Chinese ''feng'' meaning 'peak'.

== Description ==
Jengish Chokusu is a massif, with several summits along its lengthy ridge. Only its main summit breaks 7,000&amp;nbsp;m. It is located {{convert|16|km|mi|abbr=on}} southwest of [[Khan Tengri]] (7,010&amp;nbsp;m / 22,998&amp;nbsp;ft), separated by the South [[Engilchek Glacier|Engilchek]] glacier, where base camps for both mountains are usually located. The massif runs at [[Angle#Types of angles|right angles]] to the glaciers which flow from it into three alpine valleys in Kyrgyzstan on the north, all eventually running to the [[Engilchek Glacier]], the largest in the Tian Shan. Its main summit is usually approached from the Zvozdochka (Russian for "little star") glacier, which is coloured red with rocks from Jengish Chokusu.

Administratively, the Kyrgyzstan side of the mountain is in the [[Ak-Suu District]] of  [[Issyk-Kul Region]], and the Chinese side, in [[Wensu County]] of the [[Aksu Prefecture]] of [[Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region]].

==Records==
[[Image:Stamp of Kyrgyzstan 232a.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Jengish Chokusu (Pobeda Peak) on a Kyrgyzstan stamp.]]
Jengish Chokusu is the highest mountain in Kyrgyzstan. Jengish Chokusu is considered the most northerly 7,000-metre mountain in the world by geologists; the actual rock summit of [[Khan Tengri]], the Tian Shan's third highest peak, is 6,995m above sea level, though a thick layer of ice adds another 15m to its altitude, such that [[mountaineering|mountaineers]] classify it as 7,000m peak.

The South Engilchek Glacier and its side glaciers occupy the entire north side of Peak Jengish Chokusu.  This glacier, currently at 60.5&amp;nbsp;km in length, is the sixth longest outside of the world's polar regions.&lt;ref&gt;Tajikistan's Fedchenko Glacier is 77 km long, and the Karakoram's Siachen and Biafo Glaciers are 70 and 67 km long respectively.  Measurements are from recent imagery, with Russian 1:200,000 scale topographic mapping for reference as well as the 1990 ‘’Orographic Sketch Map: Karakoram:  Sheets 1 &amp; 2’’, Swiss Foundation for Alpine Research, Zurich.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Пик Победы 'Võidu mäetipp' 87.jpg|thumb|Peak seen in 1987. Photo by [[Jaan Künnap]].]]
Although Jengish Chokusu is over 400 metres higher, [[Khan Tengri]] was believed to be the highest peak in the range until Jengish Chokusu's survey in 1946. A Soviet expedition mounted in 1938 to mark the 20th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Youth movement [[Komsomol]] claimed to have climbed the highest peak in the area, the summit being reached on September 19 by L.Gutman, E.Ivanov and A.Sidorenko. They measured the altitude as 6900 meters, and named the peak ''Pik 20-ti letiya Komsomola'' (Peak of the 20th Anniversary of Komsomol). A survey by another team in 1943 found the peak to be 7439 meters high. The peak was renamed as ''Pik Pobedy'' (Victory's Peak) in 1946 to commemorate the Soviet victory in [[World War II]]. The significant difference in altitude led to the 1938 ascent being called into question, although the official Soviet stand was to uphold the 1938 ascent.&lt;ref&gt;The Great Soviet Encyclopedia , 1979&lt;/ref&gt; A large-scale attempt on the peak in 1955 was disastrous, when 11 expedition members were killed in a blizzard.&lt;ref&gt;William Garner, 'High Road to 'Victory'" Soviet and U.S. Climbers conquer Pik Pobedy, ''National Geographic Magazine'', August 1986 (p.258)&lt;/ref&gt; Jengish Chokusu's first indisputably verified ascent was in 1956 by [[Vitaly Mikhaylovich Abalakov|Vitaly Abalakov]]'s party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite summitpost|id=151896|title=Pik Pobeda}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Chinese expedition climbed the peak from the Chinese side in 1977: the expedition book makes no mention of the Russian first ascent and gives the impression that the Chinese ascent was the first climb.&lt;ref&gt;Planting the Five-Star Flag on Mount Tomur, Foreign Languages Press, Beijing, 1979&lt;/ref&gt; The first winter ascent of the peak was made by [[Valery Khrichtchatyi]] in February 1990.&lt;ref name="bonington"&gt;Chris Bonington, “Great Climbs”, p.206, {{ISBN|1-85732-573-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Karl Andree''' (20 October 1808 – 10 August 1875) was a German [[geographer]].

==Biography==
Andree was born in [[Braunschweig]].  He was educated at [[University of Jena|Jena]], [[University of Göttingen|Göttingen]], and [[University of Berlin|Berlin]].  After having been implicated in a students' political agitation he became a journalist, and in 1851 founded the newspaper ''[[Bremer Handelsblatt]]''. From 1855, however, he devoted himself entirely to geography and [[ethnography]], working successively at [[Leipzig]] and at [[Dresden]].  During the [[American Civil War]], he advocated the cause of the secessionists.  In 1862 he founded the important geographical periodical ''Globus''. He died at [[Wildungen]]. His son [[Richard Andree]] followed in his father's career.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

This is a list of [[monarchy|monarchs]] who have reigned over the Pacific island of [[Niue]]. The island today is a self-governing territory in [[Associated state|free association]] with New Zealand, and recognises the [[Queen of New Zealand]] as monarch. Before this, however, the island previously had an indigenous monarchy, established around the beginning of the 18th century.

Before that time, there appears to have been no national government or national leader in Niue. Chiefs and heads of family exercised authority over segments of the population. Around 1700, the concept and practice of [[kingship]] appears to have been introduced through contact with [[Samoa]] or [[Tonga]]. From then on, a succession of ''[[patu-iki]]'' (kings) ruled the island, the first of whom was Puni-mata. The monarch was non-hereditary; ''patu-iki'' were reportedly elected by the Niuean population, with the candidates being issued from influential families. As described by [[Percy Smith (ethnologist)|Percy Smith]] in 1903, Niue appears therefore to have been a [[democracy|democratic]] [[elective monarchy]].

|The second Christian Niuean monarch. One of his first acts as ''patu-iki'' in 1877 was to send a letter to the [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|British monarch]] [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]], requesting that Niue be made a protectorate of the [[British Empire]], to protect the island from other imperial powers, although his letter (and another sent in 1895) received no replies.

|He was the king who finally ceded Niue to the British Empire on April 21, 1900, and who welcomed a Resident representative of the imperial government on Niue on September 11, 1901. Togia-Pulu-toaki remained ''patu-iki'' in 1903, when ''Niuē-fekai (or Savage) Island and its People'' was published and the date of his death, and whether or not he was succeeded, remains unclear.

==Imperial rule and free association==

From 1900 to 1901, Niue was ruled by the United Kingdom. In 1901, the island was annexed by New Zealand, which administered it in the name of the British Empire. On 26 September 1907, New Zealand attained the status of [[British Dominions|dominion]], becoming the [[Dominion of New Zealand]], and the British monarch from then on reigned over Niue in his or her capacity as monarch of New Zealand. [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Elizabeth II]] was the first monarch to be explicitly titled [[Queen of New Zealand]], however, in 1952. Today, Niue is part of the [[Realm of New Zealand]], the successor political entity to the dominion.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4022">'''Nathanael Carpenter''' (1589–c. 1628) was an English [[author]], [[philosopher]], and [[geographer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite DNB|wstitle=Carpenter, Nathanael|volume=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==

He was son of [[John Carpenter (rector)|John Carpenter]], [[Rector (ecclesiastical)|rector]] of [[Northleigh]], [[Devon]], and was born there on 7 February 1589.&lt;ref name="ACFSA"&gt;Alexander Chalmers, F.S.A., 1813, ''The General Biographical Dictionary: Containing An Historical and Critical Account of the Lives and Writings of the Most Eminent Persons in Every Nation; Particularly the British and Irish; from the Earliest Accounts to the Present Time'', revised and enlarged; Volume VIII, p. 273, gives his birth date as 7 February 1588 and states that he was born in [[Northlew|North-Lew]], [[West Devon]] [[district]] of the county of [[Devon]], "not [[Northleigh|Northlegh]]."&lt;/ref&gt;  He matriculated at [[St. Edmund Hall, Oxford]], on 7 June 1605; but was elected, on a recommendatory letter of [[James I]], a Devonshire fellow of [[Exeter College, Oxford|Exeter College]] on 30 June 1607. A second Devonshire candidate, Michael Jermyn, obtained an equal number of votes; the vice-chancellor gave his decision in favour of Carpenter. The dates of Carpenter's degrees were: [[Bachelor of Arts]] 5 July 1610, [[Master of Arts]] 1618, [[Bachelor of Divinity]] 11 May 1620, [[Doctor of Divinity]] 1626. During his residence at Oxford he is said to have become a noted philosopher, poet, mathematician, and geographer. One of his pupils at the university was [[Sir William Morice]], secretary of state 1660–8, a politician with religious views similar to his tutor's [[Calvinism]].

[[Matthew Sutcliffe]] nominated him a member of [[Chelsea College (17th century)|Chelsea College]], and Archbishop [[James Ussher]] brought him to Ireland, where he was appointed schoolmaster of the king's wards in [[Dublin]] (wards being minors of property whose parents were Roman Catholics). Carpenter's death is said to have occurred at Dublin in the beginning of 1628, and his funeral sermon was preached by [[Robert Ussher]].

==Works==
His earliest work ''Philosophia libera triplici exercitationum decade proposita'' was an attack on the [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] system of philosophy, and appeared at [[Frankfurt]] in 1621, under the pseudonym "N. C. Cosmopolitanus." Later editions were issued under his name in 1622, 1636, and 1675. His treatise of ''Geography Delineated Forth in Two Books'' was published in 1625, and republished in 1685. Three sermons entitled ''Achitophel, or the Picture of a Wicked Politician'', preached to the [[University of Oxford]] and dedicated to [[James Ussher]], are stated to have appeared in 1627, 1628, 1629, 1638, 1638, and 1642. The first edition was called in, and the passages against [[Arminianism in the Church of England|Arminianism]] were removed. After his death there appeared (1633 and 1640) a sermon, ''Chorazin and Bethsaida's Woe'', which he had preached at [[St. Mary's, Oxford]]. The dedication by N. H. was to [[Thomas Winniffe]], and asserts that but for a kinsman the manuscript might have been lost on the Dutch shores, as Carpenter's works on optics were in the Irish Sea.

== Numbers of listings ==
The following are approximate tallies of current listings in the United States Virgin Islands on the National Register of Historic Places. These counts are based on entries in the National Register Information Database as of April 24, 2008&lt;ref name="nris"&gt;{{NRISref|2008b}}&lt;/ref&gt; and new weekly listings posted since then on the National Register of Historic Places web site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cr.nps.gov/nr/nrlist.htm |title=National Register of Historic Places: Weekly List Actions |accessdate=January 16, 2009 |publisher=National Park Service}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are frequent additions to the listings and occasional delistings and the counts here are not official. Also, the counts in this table exclude boundary increase and decrease listings which modify the area covered by an existing property or district and which carry a separate National Register reference number.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7978">The '''Port Jew''' concept was formulated by [[Lois Dubin]] and [[David Sorkin]] in the late 1990s as a [[social type]] that describes Jews who were involved in the seafaring and maritime economy of Europe, especially in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Helen Fry suggests that they could be considered to have been "the earliest modern Jews."&lt;ref name=HelenFry&gt;{{cite journal |title=Port Jews: Jewish Communities in Cosmpolitan Maritime Trading Centres, 1550-1950 |first=Helen P. |last=Fry |journal=European Judaism |volume= 36|publisher=Frank Cass Publishers |year=2002 |ISBN=0-7146-8286-1|url=https://www.questia.com/googleScholar.qst?docId=5002650793 |quote=Port Jews were a social type, usually those who were involved in seafaring and maritime trade, who (like Court Jews) could be seen as the earliest modern Jews. Often arriving as refugees from the Inquisition, they were permitted to settle as merchants and allowed to trade openly in places such as Amsterdam, London, Trieste and Hamburg. 'Their Diaspora connections and accumulated expertise lay in exactly the areas of overseas expansion that were then of interest to mercantilist governments.'}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The concept of the "Port Jew" has been suggested as an "alternate path to modernity" that was distinct from the European [[Haskalah]].  Port Jews are described as the product of what is characterized as the "liberal environment" of port towns and cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=C. S. |last=Monaco |title=Port Jews or a People of the Diaspora? A Critique of the Port Jew Concept |journal=Jewish Social Studies: History, Culture, Society |volume=15.2 |year=2009 |url=http://works.bepress.com/c_monaco/2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

David Sorkin restricts his definition of the "port Jew" to apply only to a very specific group of Sephardi and Italian-Jewish merchants who were participants in the Mediterranean and transatlantic economy of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries.&lt;ref name=Sorkin&gt;{{cite journal |first=David |last=Sorkin |title=The Port Jew: Notes Toward a Social Type |journal=Journal of Jewish Studies |location=Cambridge, England |volume=50 |number=1 |date=Spring 1999 |pages=87–97}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==

According to Helen Fry, Port Jews often arrived as "refugees from the Inquisition" and the expulsion of Jews from Iberia.  They were allowed to settle in port cities as merchants granted permission to trade in ports such as Amsterdam, London, Trieste and Hamburg.  Fry notes that their connections with the [[Jewish diaspora]] and their expertise in maritime trade made them of particular interest to the mercantilist governments of Europe.&lt;ref name=HelenFry /&gt;  Lois Dubin describes Port Jews as Jewish merchants who were "valued for their engagement in the international maritime trade upon which such cities thrived".&lt;ref&gt;Dubin p. 47&lt;/ref&gt; Sorkin and others have characterized the socio-cultural profile of these men as marked by a flexibility towards religion and a "reluctant cosmopolitanism that was alien to both traditional and "enlightened" Jewish identities."

== Port Jewish families and business in the early modern period ==
Jewish family tradition and strategy was built upon business and safety.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Davis|first=Natalie|year=1997|title=Religion and Capitalism Once Again? Jewish Merchant Culture in the Seventeenth Century|jstor=2928815|journal=University of California Press|volume=|pages=60–74|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jewish families, as in the case with the Jewish merchant Glikl, married off her children both in nearby cities as well as distant cities for the reason of business and safety.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Glikl being a business woman was not uncommon amongst the German Jews. Christian, Italy, and France all differed from Jewish life history in that it was based on ethical will, which included more of a tale of life lessons to be passed on to the children as well as direction on how to proceed after their death.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Glikl in writing her memoir focused on analyzing accounts of her life while simultaneously addressing her children.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Not only was “[[Glückel of Hameln|Memoirs of Gluckel of Hameln]]” a rich source for cultural and social history, but it also had unusual literacy structure and religious resonance.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In Jewish family culture ''koved'' was directly in tune with honesty in business which is also connected to your status, ''oysher un koved''.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Glikl prided herself on leaving Hamburg without a bad debt with any jew or non jewish person. Jewish business failure held huge weight in bringing shame and disgrace to the Jewish name.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Port Jewish widows in the early modern period ===
During the [[early modern period]], wives of [[Jewish history|Port Jew]] merchants participated in business through their approach of marriage as a business partnership.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tallan|first=Cheryl|year=1991|title=Medieval Jewish Widows: Their Control of Resources|url=|journal=Jewish History|publisher=Springer|volume=5| issue = 1|pages=63–74}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cheryl Tallan explains how earlier recordings of Jewish women partaking in their husbands’ business dealings can be witnessed in the case recorded by Rabbi Samson in 1216.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; During the seventeenth and eighteenth century, women such as [[Glückel of Hameln|Glickl of Hameln]], as read in the “[[Glückel of Hameln|Memoirs of Gluckel of Hameln]]”, (including both her mother and grandmother) participated in their husbands’ business dealings as Port Jews in Hamburg.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=acls;idno=heb01639|title=Women on the Margins|last=Zemon Davis|first=Natalie|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=1995|isbn=0674955218|location=Boston|pages=5–72|quote=|via=University of Michigan E-Book}}&lt;/ref&gt; As was common with many Jewish couples during this period, women had the opportunity to continue their family business after their husbands were deceased.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; As a widow, they received a dowry from their husbands upon their husbands’ death.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Through the dowries, Jewish widows were able to continue their husbands’ business dealings and their children’s marriage proposals through the utilization of the business networks established prior to their husbands’ death.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Expanded to include Ashkenazi merchants==

Dubin has proposed that the concept of the "port Jew" be expanded to describe "port Jewry" which she describes as a particular type of Jewish community that existed in European maritime ports and combined maritime commerce with European and Jewish culture.  This expanded definition would encompass Ashkenazi as well as Sephardi merchants living in other European ports such as Hamburg, Southampton, Portsmouth, and Odessa.

== History ==
[[File:Prosta Tower fasada.JPG|thumb|The building's facade.]]
Building permits were obtained in 2006, and construction began in 2007 and ended in September 2011. Prosta Tower has 19 floors above ground and has a 5 floor car park underground. It adjoins the northern side of [[Łucka City]], which is a pairing system unique to Poland and is rarely seen elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/934786231|title=Złota 44 i inne warszawskie niebotyki|last=).|first=Zieliński, Jarosław (1958-|date=2015|publisher=EKBIN Studio PR Ewa Kielak Ciemniewska|others=Szczawiński, Paweł., EKBIN Studio PR.|isbn=9788394094102|location=Warszawa|oclc=934786231}}&lt;/ref&gt; The building was designed by [[Stefan Kuryłowicz]]. Initially, the project was a residential building, but the investor, [[Marvipol]], made it become an office building because of the [[Financial crisis of 2007–2008|financial crisis at the time]]. Because of this decision, the building gained its characteristic [[openwork]] [[facade]], which also limits sun exposure inside the building by around 40%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.muratorplus.pl/inwestycje/inwestycje-komercyjne/biura-w-warszawie-biurowiec-prosta-tower-o-charakterystycznej-elewacji-z-betonowego-azuru_80345.html|title=Biura w Warszawie.

In [[statistics]], a '''ranklet''' is an orientation-selective non-parametric feature which is based on the computation of [[Mann–Whitney U|Mann–Whitney–Wilcoxon]] (MWW) rank-sum test statistics. Ranklets achieve similar response to [[Haar wavelet]]s as they share the same pattern of orientation-selectivity, multi-scale nature and a suitable notion of completeness.

Rank-based (non-parametric) features have become popular in the field of [[image processing]] for their robustness in detecting outliers and invariance to monotonic transformations such as brightness, contrast changes and [[gamma correction]].

The [[Mann–Whitney U|MWW]] is a combination of [[Wilcoxon signed-rank test|Wilcoxon rank-sum test]] and Mann–Whitney U-test. It is a non-parametric alternative to the [[Student's t-test|t-test]] used to test the hypothesis for the comparison of two independent distributions. It assesses whether two samples of observations, usually referred as Treatment '''''T''''' and Control '''''C''''', come from the same distribution but do not have to be normally distributed.

The Wilcoxon rank-sum statistics ''W''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt; is determined as:

: &lt;math&gt;W_s=\sum^N_{i=1}\pi_i V_i \text{ where }\pi_i = \text{rank of element }i\text{ and }V_i
= \begin{cases}
0 &amp; \text{ for }\pi_i\in C \\[3pt]
1 &amp; \text{ for }\pi_i\in T
\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;

Subsequently, let ''MW'' be the Mann–Whitney statistics defined by:

: &lt;math&gt;MW=W_s-\frac{m(m+1)}{2}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''m'' is the number of Treatment values.

A ranklet ''R'' is defined as the normalization of ''MW'' in the range [&amp;minus;1,&amp;nbsp;+1]:

: &lt;math&gt;R = \frac{MW}{mn/2}-1&lt;/math&gt;

where a positive value means that the Treatment region is brighter than the Control region, and a negative value otherwise.

==Example==
Suppose &lt;math&gt;T=\lbrace 5,9,1,10,15\rbrace &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;C=\lbrace 20,4,7,13,19,11\rbrace&lt;/math&gt; then

| &lt;center&gt;C&lt;/center&gt;
| &lt;center&gt;T&lt;/center&gt;
| &lt;center&gt;C&lt;/center&gt;

| &lt;center&gt;5&lt;/center&gt;
| &lt;center&gt;6&lt;/center&gt;
| &lt;center&gt;7&lt;/center&gt;
| &lt;center&gt;8&lt;/center&gt;
| &lt;center&gt;9&lt;/center&gt;
| &lt;center&gt;10&lt;/center&gt;
| &lt;center&gt;11&lt;/center&gt;
|}
&lt;/center&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;W_s=\Big\lbrace 1+3+5+6+9\Big\rbrace =24&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;MW=24-[5 \times (5+1)/2]=9&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;R=[9/[5 \times 6/2]]-1=-0.4&lt;/math&gt;

Hence, in the above example the Control region was a little bit brighter than the Treatment region.

==Method==
Since Ranklets are non-linear filters, they can only be applied in the spatial domain. Filtering with Ranklets involves dividing an image window ''W'' into Treatment and Control regions as shown in the image below:

[[Image:Ranklets.png|center|400px|Orientation-Selective Ranklets]]

Subsequently, Wilcoxon rank-sum test statistics are computed in order to determine the intensity variations among conveniently
chosen regions (according to the required orientation) of the samples in ''W''. The intensity values of both regions are then
replaced by the respective ranking scores. These ranking scores determine a pairwise comparison between the '''''T''''' and '''''C''''' regions. This means that a ranklet essentially counts the number of '''T'''x'''C''' pairs which are brighter in the '''''T''''' set. Hence a positive value means that the Treatment values are brighter than the Control values, and vice versa.

'''Sawa Lake'''  ({{lang-ar| بحيرة ساوة}}) is  an [[Endorheic basin]] located in the Iraqi governorate of  [[Muthanna Governorate|Muthanna]] near to the [[Euphrates]] River, some  {{convert|23|km}} to the west of [[Samawah|Al-Samawa]] city. This lake has no inlet or outlet, but it draws water from the Euphrates through a system of joint cracks and fissures which transport water to aquifers beneath it. The water's level fluctuates during dry and wet seasons but does not dry up because of the equilibrium state between water feed and evaporation.

==Description==
Lake Sawa is a unique body of water in Iraq since characterized by highest salinity value (up to 35 g/l as TDS)&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Boschetti|first=Tiziano|last2=Awadh|first2=Salih Muhammad|last3=Salvioli-Mariani|first3=Emma|date=2018|title=The Origin and MgCl2–NaCl Variations in an Athalassic Sag Pond: Insights from Chemical and Isotopic Data|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10498-018-9337-y|journal=Aquatic Geochemistry|language=en|volume=24|issue=2|pages=137–162|doi=10.1007/s10498-018-9337-y|issn=1380-6165|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; among Iraqi inland bodies water. Chemical and isotope analyses revealed its meteoric origin and a confirm a main feeding from the ascending groundwater from the lake bottom via joints, cracks, and fissure systems.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The lake has longitudinal  shape with 4.47&amp;nbsp;km, long and 1.77&amp;nbsp;km wide.The water level in the lake is one of the manifestations of the lake, which gives something of aesthetic and strangeness. Strangeness reflected the fact that the water level in the lake is higher than the adjacent land around the lake by 1–4 meters . Add to that, the water level of the lake is also higher than the water level of the Euphrates River by 5–7 meters which flow near the lake to the east side and the Shat Al-Arab and [[Persian Gulf]] by 17–20 m.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.iasj.net/iasj?func=fulltext&amp;aId=110919|title =Bull. Iraq nat. Hist. Mus.|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  A formations of gypsum are surrounding the lake, in some cases these a gypsum formations reach 6 m tall. They are formed due to evaporation of salty water and sedimentation of salt in shallow banks of lake.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.iasj.net/iasj?func=fulltext&amp;aId=86984|title = Iraqi Academic Scientific journal|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; A formations of gypsum  works as a dam prevent water flow  from the lake  on surrounding areas.

==Climate==
Sawa Lake is characterized  by arid climate. Highest  and lowest temperatures are ranges between (27.6– 44.6) °C. Mean annual rainfall is 110&amp;nbsp;mm per year, highest values of evaporation occur during July (506&amp;nbsp;mm) while  lowest values occurring in January (89&amp;nbsp;mm). Overall wind direction is a North-West  with speed of 4.1&amp;nbsp;m/s.
&lt;ref&gt;Iraqi Meteorological Organization., 2012: Climate data of recorded in Al-Sammwa station forperiod from (1990-2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Flora and fauna==
Because of its saline water, no plants grow in the lake or on its shores. [[Fish]] and [[algae]] are the most important aquatic organisms. One kind of fish lives in Sawa Lake, the [[Arabian toothcarp]] of the genus ''[[Aphanius]]'', [[Pupfish|Cyprinodontidatae]] family, characterized by its soft appearance, small size (they do not exceed 10&amp;nbsp;cm), and eyes that quickly disappear after death. Also there are  ''[[Pomatiopsis|Pomatiopsis tryon]]'' which is [[Gastropoda|Gastropoda genus]] and lives in brackish water from [[Oligocene|Oligocene age]] to recent times, particularly on the lake bottom.

Unlike its scarcity of aquatic organisms, Sawa Lake is rich with birds; 25 species of resident and immigrant birds were observed in Sawa Lake and the surrounding areas. the lake held large numbers of [[waterfowl]], mainly [[duck]]s and [[Eurasian coot|coot]] (''Fulica atra''). The endemic race of [[little grebe]] (''Tachybaptus ruficollis iraquensis'') and the [[Mesopotamian crow]] (''Corvus cornix capellanus'') occur, as well as the near-endemic [[grey hypocolius]]. Locals and hunters reported the frequent occurrence of “different kinds of raptors” especially in spring and autumn, so the site may be important as a staging area.

The desert area on the western side of the lake, the fresh wetland strip (represented by the western branch of Euphrates River including the orchards), and the flat arid/semi-desert areas over the southern parts of the lake might harbor considerable wildlife diversity,  mammals present include [[Rüppell's fox]], [[striped hyena]] (near-threatened), [[honey badger]], and [[Indian gray mongoose]] (''Herpestes edwardsii''). Reptiles found included: Water snake (maybe Natrix tessellata).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.natureiraq.org/uploads/9/2/7/0/9270858/sawa_lake_mt1_22_mar-anna.pdf|title = Sawa Lake and the surrounding area (MT1)|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Environmental Concerns==
As Sawa Lake represents a unique, closed water body in Iraq  it is an important site to protect for its scientific, educational and biodiversity value. Only human intrusion was considered a high threat because Sawa Lake is the only water body available for the city of Samawa and its surroundings. It is a popular picnic area but this has caused a great deal of garbage accumulation everywhere around the lake. There appears to be no effort by visitors or government to manage or remove garbage from the site. Because there is no plant cover on the lake (reed beds, etc.),
water birds have few places to shelter from visitors or hunters. Three threats were classified as ‘high’:urban expansion (the team was informed that the lake area was submitted for an investment project which might involve new construction around the lake); hunting, primarily represented by fishing (mainly netting) and hunting of birds, and pollution caused by the frequent visitors. Other threats (agriculture, resource extraction, transportation &amp; service corridors, and natural systems modification) were considered ‘low’.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The lake has been designated as a protected [[Ramsar site]] since 2014.&lt;ref name="RSIS"/&gt;

'''Thabana Ntlenyana''', which literally means "Beautiful little mountain" in [[Sesotho]], is the highest point in [[Lesotho]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sommer|first=Chris|title=Roof of the Maloti|url=http://www.vertical-endeavour.com/lesotho/60-peaks/84-roof-maloti-drakensberg.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and the highest [[mountain]] in southern [[Africa]]. It is situated on the [[Mohlesi]] ridge of the [[Drakensberg]]/[[Maloti Mountains]], north of [[Sani Pass]]. It stands at {{convert|3482|m|ft|0}} high.

The peak is usually climbed by groups completing a Grand Traverse of the Drakensberg, although the peak is technically in the Maloti Mountains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sommer|first=Chris|title=Grand Traverse|url=http://www.vertical-endeavour.com/drakensberg/29-grand-traverse/7-what-is-grand-traverse.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The peak is often also climbed from [[Sani Top Chalet]] or from [[Vergelegen Nature Reserve]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Geo Maps Series Map 5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Veliko Blato''' ({{lang-sr|Велико Блато}}) is a lake in [[Krnjača]],&lt;ref name="Politika"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.politika.rs/sr/clanak/355056/Jedinstvene-divlje-orhideje-u-Velikom-blatu-Palilule|author=Branka Vasiljević|title= Jedinstvene divlje orhideje u Velikkom blatu Palilule|date=15 May 2016|publisher=[[Politika]]|language=Serbian}}&lt;/ref&gt; an urban neighborhood of [[Belgrade]], [[Serbia]]. It is located in the municipality of [[Palilula, Belgrade|Palilula]].

== Location ==

The lake is located in the northern section of Krnjača, {{convert|10|km|abbr=on}}&lt;ref name="Politika"/&gt; north of downtown Belgrade. It is positioned at the tripoint of the neighborhoods of [[Borča]], [[Ovča]] and Krnjača.

==Geography==

Veliko Blato is situated in the southern part of the [[Pančevački Rit]] marshland. The lake is generally heart-shaped and covers an area of {{convert|1.8|km2|abbr=on}} or {{convert|2|km2|abbr=on}} with the adjoining fish ponds. It is the largest body of water in the Pančevački Rit, though it is shallow, as the maximum depth is only {{convert|1.5|m|abbr=on}}. The area of the entire protected zone which surrounds the lake, and includes four [[fish pond]]s to the north, is {{convert|3|km2|abbr=on}}. The lake is embedded in the depression between the [[reed (plant)|reed covered]] wet floodplains. The lake has no inflows or outflows, though the entire northern part is encircled by the [[Sebeš]] canal and another canal closely engulfs the entire lake. Water is replenished from the Danube and through the underground springs.&lt;ref name="Politika"/&gt;

The name of the lake means "great [[mudflat]]" in Serbian.

== Wildlife ==
=== Plants ===

In and around the lake there are 191 plant species, out of which 14 are protected. Since 1865, when [[Josif Pančić]] found the first specimen, 30 species of orchids have been registered on the territory of the City of Belgrade. Two of them can be found only in Veliko Blato. One is [[marsh helleborine]] (Epipactis palustris (L.) Cr.), with some 200 individual plants. It grows only up to {{convert|20|m|abbr=on}} from the canal which encircles the lake. It was discovered near the lake in 2012. The other, with only some 50 specimens, is [[Orchis palustris]] Jacq. It grows between the turfs of grass where the water has dug minute canals. It was spotted for the first time in Belgrade in 1896 on the [[Great War Island]], but was never seen again there. It has been re-discovered in the [[Makiš]] area in 1955, but by 2001 it disappeared, too.&lt;ref name="Politika"/&gt;&lt;ref name="beta"&gt;{{Citation | last = | first = | author = Beta| title = Uskoro zaštita staništa orhideja u Beogradu | newspaper = [[Politika]] | pages =  | language = Serbian | date = 29 June 2013 | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = | first = | author = Branka Vasiljević | title = Retka orhideja u Krnjači | newspaper = [[Politika]] | pages =  | language = Serbian | date = August 2012 | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Animals ===

One species of fish, [[European weatherfish]], is protected. Other of the 15 species of fish include [[carp]], [[northern pike]], [[wels catfish]], [[zander]] and [[silver carp]], though they are introduced later. There are also 9 species of amphibians and 4 species of reptiles. The lake is suitable for [[newts]], [[frogs]], [[lizards]], [[grass snakes]] and [[dice snakes]].&lt;ref name="Politika"/&gt;

Veliko Blato is inhabited by 120 species of birds. There is a mixed colony of heron species which consists of [[little egret]]s, [[squacco heron]]s, [[grey heron]]s, [[night herons]] and [[purple heron]]s. The colony was discovered only in June 2013 and is the only nesting heron colony on the urban territory of Belgrade, with several dozens of nesting couples. Other birds include [[Eurasian coot]], [[great cormorant]], [[pygmy cormorant]], [[Caspian gull]], [[black-headed gull]], [[diving duck]], [[common pochard]], [[mallard]], [[tufted duck]]. Largest European eagle, [[white-tailed eagle]], nests in the other parts of Belgrade (Great War Island, [[Ada Huja]]), but feeds in the area. The lake is an internationally important area for the bird protection.&lt;ref name="Politika"/&gt;&lt;ref name="beta"/&gt;

== Human interaction ==

"Mika Alas", carp-breeding fish pond was established in 1961, when the lake was populated with many fish species. Veliko Blato is used as a [[feedlot]] for the larger fish. Four basins (including two fry ponds ), north of the lake, are built as a part of the fish pond. The lake is used for the [[sports fishing]] and all the fish that has been caught, must be released back into the lake. Every year, after the fishing season is over, the smaller basins are being emptied.&lt;ref name="Politika"/&gt;

In the early 2010s, an [[illegal dumping]] created a landfill south of the lake, which hastened the procedure of placing the lake under protection. Veliko Blato is not suitable for swimming and bathing due to the large quantities of mud in it.&lt;ref name="Politika"/&gt;

'''Wainamah''' is one of 33 villages in the town of [[Jakiri]], [[Cameroon]].   It is the second village into Jakiri from [[Bamenda]]. It is located along the Ring Road in the North West Region of Cameroon, on a hill. It is bounded by Babessi town in Ngoketuja Division and villages like Sarkong, Ntseimban, Waarin, Limbo and Kwansoh.

==History==
The name ''Wainamah'' comes from the [[Nso language]] (lamnso).  ''Wai Namah'' is literally translated as "tobacco market".  The name stems from the first settlers of the area who were cultivating and selling tobacco.  They then became numerous that the area grew into a village.

==Education==

==Economy==

Agriculture is the backbone of the economy of Wainamah village. Though the name 'Wainamah' means 'tobacco market', it is a bit difficult to find tobacco in the area.  This is because of the decline in the price of the tobacco years back, new farms and modern methods of cultivation by the companies that used to buy the local tobacco from these villagers, thus, the new generation here does not find it worthy to cultivate the tobacco since it is mainly for export,  consumed by a very few aged people.  The abandonment of tobacco cultivation led to peasant agriculture with main crops like maize, beans, cassava, palm wine tapping and cattle rearing.  Wainamah has the second largest cattle market in Bui Division with a slaughter slap provided by the state. The villagers of Wainamah take advantage of the long rainy season which ensures continuous availability of grass and legumes for animals to rear a good number of cattle, goats and sheep.

The cold temperatures slow down agricultural activities as crops such as maize which is one of the main crops cultivated here take up to 7–8 months to mature. This forces the villagers to take up farms in the neighboring villages like Kwanso or Babessi town.

There also exist a few shops in the village. Here, bars or drinking spots of either mix of industrially brewed drinks and palm wine or exclusive palm wine spots which outnumber the industrially brewed drinks spots.
