The Bainuk are believed to have been the first inhabitants of the lower [[Casamance]].&lt;blockquote&gt;The name ''Banyun'' is attributed to the Portuguese, who derived the word from Mandinka and applied it as a collective name for a number of groups settled at strategic sites along waterways, portages, and trade paths between the Gambia and Cacheu rivers.... Possibly ''Banyun'' served as a generic term for "trader," much as ''dyula'' identifies Mande traders engaged in long-distance commerce (Map 9).&lt;ref&gt;George E. Brooks, ''Landlords and strangers: Ecology, society, and trade in Western Africa, 1000-1630'' (Westview Press, 1993; {{ISBN|0813312620}}), p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the fifteenth century, there were at least five Bainuk states including [[Bichangor]], [[Jase]], [[Foni]] and [[Buguando]].  The Bainuk were also a major component of the population of [[Kasa (kingdom)|Kasa]].

In modern times the Bambe have often become absorbed into the [[Mandé peoples|Mande]] or [[Jola people|Jola]] cultures.

It is also one of the original 17 regulatory institutions to make specific national commitments to financial inclusion under the [[The Maya Declaration|Maya Declaration]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/maya-declaration-urges-financial-inclusion-for-worlds-unbanked-populations-130887928.html|title=Maya Declaration Urges Financial Inclusion for World's Unbanked Populations|last=Inclusion|first=Alliance for Financial|website=www.prnewswire.com|language=en|access-date=2017-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; during the 2011 [[AFI Global Policy Forum|Global Policy Forum]] held in Mexico.

==History==
The central bank evolved step by step:

* [[Royal Decree of 27 July 1887]] establishes the [[franc]] as the money of account for the [[Independent State of Congo]], and Burundi is included as well.
* [[Heligoland Agreement of 1890]] puts Rwanda and Burundi within the German [[sphere of influence]] in Africa; [[German East African rupie]] is the official [[currency]]; circulation of the [[French franc]] continues nonetheless.
* As a result of [[Belgium]]'s actions, the [[Belgian Congo]] becomes a member of the [[Latin Monetary Union]] in 1908.
* [[Bank of Belgian Congo]] established in 1909.
* Bank of Belgian Congo issues its first banknotes in 1912.
* Rwanda and Burundi attached to the [[Congo Franc Zone]] following [[Germany]]'s defeat in [[World War I]]; 1927
* [[Colony of Belgian Congo]] and the [[Bank of Belgian Congo]] create a new relationship; 1927 - 1952
** [[World War II]] era: temporary involvement of the [[Bank of England]]; [[Congo franc]] is listed in London.
* [[Belgian Congo and Ruanda-Urundi Central Bank]] (BCCBRU) 1952 - 1960
* [[Banque d' Emission du Rwanda et du Burundi]] (BERB) / (Issuing Bank of Rwanda and Burundi) - 1960 - 1964
* [[Banque du Royaume du Burund]] (BRB) / [[Royal Bank of Burundi]] and the [[Banque Nationale du Rwanda]] (BNR) open in 1964.
* Banque de la République du Burundi (BRB) opens in 1966.

'''Cannabis in Finland''' is illegal. The 50th chapter of the [[Criminal Code of Finland|Criminal Code]] criminalises all dealings with illegal narcotics, including the production, import, transport, sale, possession and use of cannabis.&lt;ref name=RL&gt;{{cite web|title=39/1889: The Criminal Code of Finland|url=http://www.finlex.fi/en/laki/kaannokset/1889/en18890039|website=Finlex|accessdate=6 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=kainulainen&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kainulainen|first1=Heini|title=Huumeiden käyttäjien rikosoikeudellinen kontroll|url=http://www.haaste.om.fi/fi/index/lehtiarkisto/haaste32009/huumeidenkayttajienrikosoikeudellinenkontrolli.html|publisher=Haaste|accessdate=6 December 2016|language=Finnish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The prohibition of cannabis in Finland dates back to 1966. The criminalisation of personal use has been controversial.&lt;ref name=vks&gt;{{cite web|title=VKS:2006:1 Seuraamuksen määrääminen huumausaineen käyttörikoksesta|url=http://www.vksv.fi/fi/index/julkaisutjaohjeet/valtakunnansyyttajanyleisetohjeet/syyteharkinta/vks20061seuraamuksenmaaraaminenhuumausaineenkayttorikoksesta.html|publisher=Finnish Office of the Prosecutor General|accessdate=6 December 2016|language=Finnish}}&lt;/ref&gt; Personal use was made illegal in 1972. After a tie vote, the Grand Committee solved the issue by a [[random ballot]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Kriminologi: "Säännelty on parempi kuin laiton" - Kannabiksen kohtalosta päätettiin aikoinaan arvalla|url=http://www.ess.fi/uutiset/kotimaa/2014/09/13/kriminologi-saannelty-on-parempi-kuin-laiton---kannabiksen-kohtalosta-paatettiin-aikoinaan-arvalla|accessdate=21 January 2017|work=ESS.fi|date=13 September 2014|language=fi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal use ==
The criminal procedure regarding personal use of illegal narcotics was reformed in 2001. The goal of the change was to relieve burden of personal use cases from the courts, expedite enforcement and standardise enforcement policies – specifically by stopping cases from not being prosecuted due to lack of resources. In the reformed procedure the police issue summary fines for most personal use offences, and cases are not brought to court unless the defendant so desires. Aggravated drug offences and possession with intent to redistribute (possession for sale) are always brought to court and penalties are harsher. In practice, possession of up to 10 grams of hashish or 15 grams of marijuana is deemed personal use and carries a penalty of 10–20 [[day-fine]]s.&lt;ref name=vks /&gt;

== Medical cannabis ==
An extremely limited group of medicinal users (223 in 2014) are permitted to purchase [[Sativex]] mouth spray and/or Bedrocan, Bediol or Bedica brand herbal cannabis from one of 27 apothecaries that have the permit to sell [[medical cannabis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ita-savo.fi/uutiset/kotimaa/n%C3%A4m%C3%A4-27-apteekkia-ovat-myyneet-l%C3%A4%C3%A4kekannabista-180772|title=Nämä 27 apteekkia ovat myyneet lääkekannabista|work=Itä-Savo|accessdate=28 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url = http://yle.fi/alueet/turku/2010/03/laakekannabiksen_kaytto_puhuttaa_1571689.html |title = Lääkekannabiksen käyttö puhuttaa &amp;#124; Turku |publisher = yle.fi |date = 30 March 2010 |accessdate = 2011-02-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Silvàn|first1=Sini|title=Lääkekannabis edelleen marginaalinen lääke|url=http://yle.fi/aihe/artikkeli/2015/04/20/laakekannabis-edelleen-marginaalinen-laake|publisher=YLE|accessdate=6 December 2016|language=Finnish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== About the Organization ==
'''''Child Workers in Asia'''''(CWA) - is a small support group that developed in 1985. This small support group began working with a few [[NGOs]], but in the last fifteen years it has grown from working with 5 organizations to now over 50 different organizations and groups. These groups and organizations work together to try and reduce child labor as much as possible in 14 different countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://asiasociety.org/child-workers-asia|title=Child Workers in Asia|work=Asia Society|access-date=2018-05-02|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Child Labor  ==

=== What is Child Labor? ===
Child Labor is defined as a child who is under 18 years old (this varies from country to country), who is working in an environment that can harm them physically and mentally. This includes possibly delaying or hurting they're physical and mental development. Child labor is also defined by a child missing school in order to work, or having an excessive amount of work before or after school, which could interfere with their studies or sleep, which will ultimately effect their health.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ilo.org/ipec/facts/lang--en/index.htm|title=What is child labour (IPEC)|website=www.ilo.org|language=en|access-date=2018-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Categories of Child Labor ===

* Slavery - When a person is owned by another person or persons and made to do everything they want with no control over anything. They are made to stay with the people who ''own'' them, as soon as they are purchased or captured they have to stay with that ''owner''.
* Forced labor - When a child is forced against their will to work (Fight, Cook, Clean) often if they do not listen and do what they are told they are abused or exploited. 
* Child Trafficking - This is when offenders will take child against their own will and will illegally move them to another area to, mostly, be sold for forced labor or sexual exploitation. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ilo.org/ipec/Campaignandadvocacy/Youthinaction/C182-Youth-orientated/worstforms/lang--en/index.htm|title=The worst forms of child labour (IPEC)|website=www.ilo.org|language=en|access-date=2018-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''Maldives''' - As of 2016 this country's government made improvements to their laws to eliminate child labor. This country integrating a hotline for children who are suffering from the worst forms of child labor, it is called the National Victim Support Hotline. With these improvements &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.dol.gov/agencies/ilab/resources/reports/child-labor/maldives|title=Findings on the Worst Forms of Child Labor - Maldives|date=2016-09-30|work=United States Department of Labor|access-date=2018-05-02|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Nepal''' - In this country children are forced to work to do the following: Bricks, Carpets, Embellished Textiles, and Stones. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.dol.gov/agencies/ilab/resources/reports/child-labor/nepal|title=Findings on the Worst Forms of Child Labor - Nepal|date=2016-09-30|work=United States Department of Labor|access-date=2018-05-02|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Pakistan''' - In this country children are used as workers to do the following: Glass Bangles and Surgical Instruments. There are also some products that are made by forced child labor: Brick, Carpets and Coal. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.dol.gov/agencies/ilab/resources/reports/child-labor/pakistan|title=Findings on the Worst Forms of Child Labor - Pakistan|date=2016-09-30|work=United States Department of Labor|access-date=2018-05-02|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Sri Lanka''' - In this country they have made laws and regulations to rid their country of child labor. They increased the [https://www.ncsl.org/documents/educ/ECSCompulsoryAge.pdf compulsory age] for schooling, it went from 14 to 16. But there were loopholes in the system. There were no regulations made for domestic work so children could work as a domestic worker from the ages 14 to 18. Which leaves them defenseless against offenders of sex trafficking. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.dol.gov/agencies/ilab/resources/reports/child-labor/sri-lanka|title=Findings on the Worst Forms of Child Labor - Sri Lanka|date=2016-09-30|work=United States Department of Labor|access-date=2018-05-02|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Thailand''' - In this country children are forced to work to do the following: Pornography and Sugarcane. They also have two products that force child labor: Garments and Shrimp. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.dol.gov/agencies/ilab/resources/reports/child-labor/thailand|title=Findings on the Worst Forms of Child Labor - Thailand|date=2016-09-30|work=United States Department of Labor|access-date=2018-05-02|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These countries have come along way and in 2016 they made major advancements to try and eliminate child labor; by adding regulations and different laws. This worked for some countries but more work needs to be done. Even for Sri Lanka and Maldives, who now have decreased their level of child labor drastically, still have some flaws in the system that need to be worked on, but it is a start.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.crin.org/en/library/organisations/child-workers-asia|title=Child Workers in Asia {{!}} CRIN|website=www.crin.org|language=en|access-date=2018-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Democratic Evolution Movement of Central Africa''' ({{lang-fr|Mouvement d'Evolution Démocratique de l'Afrique Centrale}}, MEDAC) was a [[political party]] in the [[Central African Republic]] led by [[Abel Goumba]]. 

==History==
MEDAC was founded in 1960 by Goumba and [[Pierre Maleombho]], the former president of the [[National Assembly (Central African Republic)|National Assembly]] who was ousted by Dacko, after they left the [[Movement for the Social Evolution of Black Africa]].

In late 1960 MEDAC mobilized protests against the increasingly authoritarian rule of [[David Dacko]]. Goumba became more and more critical of the French backing of Dacko. At a parliamentary session, MEDAC MPs staged a walk-out following accusations by Dacko that MEDAC was supporting [[tribalism]]. On 23 December MEDAC was dissolved by the government. Goumba's parliamentary immunity was repealed, and together with seven other MEDAC leaders he was arrested.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas O'Toole (1986) ''The Central African Republic: The Continent's Hidden Heart'', Westview Press&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1441">In [[Irish mythology]], the '''fear gorta''' ([[Irish language|Irish]]: ''Man of hunger'' / ''Man of famine''; also known as the '''fear gortach''') is a [[wiktionary:phantom|phantom]] of [[hunger]] resembling an [[Emaciation|emaciated]] human.

According to Yeats' ''Fairy and Folk Tales of the Irish Peasantry'' the fear gorta walks the earth during times of [[famine]], seeking [[alms]] from passers-by. In this version the fear gorta can be a potential source of good luck for generous individuals.&lt;ref&gt;[[William Butler Yeats|Yeats, W. B.]] (ed.)

The '''flag of [[Republika Srpska]]''' was adopted on 24 November 1992&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://zeljko-heimer-fame.from.hr/descr/ba-rs.html|title=The FAME: Republic of Srpska|last=Heimer|first=Zeljko|website=zeljko-heimer-fame.from.hr|access-date=2018-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

While the Constitutional Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina declared the [[coat of arms of Republika Srpska]] unconstitutional, claiming that it did not represent the non-Serb ethnicities living in the entity, the flag was deemed to be in line with the [[Constitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina|constitution]]. The court ruled that though the combination of the colours relates to the [[Flag of Serbia|Serbian tricolor]], the use of red, blue and white are considered to be [[pan-Slavic colors|pan-Slavic colours]] as well.

[[File:Unofficial Flag of Republika Srpska.png|thumb|Flag similar to the flag of the [[Serbian Orthodox Church]] which is often used by [[Bosnian Serbs]]]]The Serbian [[tricolor (flag)|tricolor]] has been used as the basis for other flags, most notably as [[Serbia]]'s official flag. [[Montenegro]] has also used the Serbian tricolor with varying shades of blue. Under [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|communist Yugoslavia]], the republics of Serbia and Montenegro had flags of same design and colors. Montenegro changed its flag in 1993 by altering the proportion and shade of blue in its flag and used this flag until 2004.

The Serbian tricolor was also the basis for the [[Republic of Serbian Krajina]]. The Serbian tricolor defaced with a [[Serbian cross]] is used as the flag of the [[Serbian Orthodox Church]].

[[Madagascar]] is a large island in the [[Indian Ocean]] off the eastern coast of southern [[Africa]], east of [[Mozambique]]. It is the [[List of islands by area|fourth largest island in the world]]. The highest point is [[Maromokotro]], in the [[Tsaratanana]] Massif region in the north of the island, at {{convert|2876|m}}. The capital [[Antananarivo]] is in the Hauts Plateaux near the centre of the island. Madagascar has a total area of {{convert|587040|km2}} with {{convert|581540|km2}} of land and {{convert|5500|km2}} of water. Madagascar is 400 kilometres (250 miles) east of mainland Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=About Madagascar |url=http://www.air-mad.com/about_location.html |work=Cortez USA Tours &amp; Travel |date=2012 |accessdate=July 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Madagascar originated as part of the [[Gondwana]] supercontinent. Its west coast was formed when Africa broke off from Gondwana around 165 million years ago. Madagascar eventually broke off from [[India]] about 88 million years ago. It is geologically located within the [[Somali plate]].

==Geographical regions==
Madagascar can be divided into twenty-three general geographical regions: the east coast, the Tsaratanana Massif, the central highlands, the west coast, and the southwest. The highest elevations parallel the east coast.&lt;ref name=LC&gt;{{cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/madagascar/7.htm|title=Madagascar-GEOGRAPHY|website=countrystudies.us|publisher=U. S. Library of Congress|accessdate=27 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Madagascar topo.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Land coverage (left) and topographical (right) maps of Madagascar]]

===East coast===
The east coast consists of a narrow band of lowlands about one kilometer wide, formed from the sedimentation of alluvial soils, and an intermediate zone composed of steep bluffs alternating with ravines bordering an escarpment of about {{convert|500|m|ft|0}} in elevation, which gives access to the central highlands. The coastal region extends roughly from north of Baie d'Antongil, the most prominent feature on the [[Masoala National Park|Masoala]] Peninsula, to the far north of the island. The coastline is straight, with the exception of a bay, offering less in the way of natural harbors than the west coast.&lt;ref name=LC/&gt; 

The [[Canal des Pangalanes]], an {{convert|800|km|mi|0|sing=on}}-long lagoon formed naturally by the washing of sand up on the island by the Indian Ocean currents and by the silting of rivers, is a feature of the coast; it has been used both as a means of transportation up and down the coast and as a fishing area. The beach slopes steeply into deep water. The east coast is considered dangerous for swimmers and sailors because of the large number of sharks that frequent the shoreline. Madagascar also has many mountains, forests, rivers, and lakes.&lt;ref name=LC/&gt;

===Tsaratanana Massif===

The Tsaratanana Massif region at the north end of the island contains, at {{convert|2880|m|ft|0}}, the highest point on the island. Further north is the Montagne d'Ambre (Ambohitra), which is of volcanic origin. The coastline is deeply indented; two prominent features are the natural harbor at [[Antsiranana]] (Diégo Suarez), just south of the Cap d'Ambre (Tanjon' i Bobaomby), and the large island of Nosy-Be to the West limits the potential of a port at Antsiranana by impeding the flow of traffic from other parts of the island.&lt;ref name=LC/&gt;

===Central highlands===
[[File:Landscape Madagascar 01.jpg|thumb|250px|Village in the central highlands]]
{{Main|Central Highlands (Madagascar)}}
The central highlands, which range from {{convert|800|to|1800|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} in altitude, contain a wide variety of topographies: rounded and eroded hills, massive granite outcrops, extinct volcanoes, eroded peneplains, and alluvial plains and marshes, which have been converted into irrigated rice fields. The central highlands extend from the Tsaratanana Massif in the north to the Ivakoany Massif in the south. They are defined rather clearly by the escarpments along the east coast, and they slope gently to the west coast. The central highlands include the Anjafy High Plateaux; the volcanic formations of Itasy (Lake Itasy is in a volcanic crater) and the Ankaratra Massif, reaching a height of {{convert|2643|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}. The Isalo Roiniforme Massif lies between the central highlands and the west coast.&lt;ref name=LC/&gt;

Antananarivo, the national capital, is located in the northern portion of the central highlands at {{convert|1276|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} above sea level. A prominent feature of the central highlands is a rift valley running north to south, located east of Antananarivo and including [[Lake Alaotra|Lac Alaotra]], the largest body of water on the island, having a length of {{convert|40|km|mi|0|abbr=on}}. The lake is located {{convert|761|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} above sea level and is bordered by two cliffs, rising {{convert|701|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} to the west and {{convert|488|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} to the east, which form the walls of a valley. This region has experienced geological [[subsidence]], and earth tremors are frequent.&lt;ref name=LC/&gt;

===West coast===

The west coast, composed of sedimentary formations, is more indented than the east coast, thus offering a number of harbors sheltered from cyclones, such as the harbor at Mahajanga. Deep bays and well-protected harbors have attracted explorers, traders, and [[pirates]] from [[Europe]], [[Africa]], and the [[Middle East]] since ancient times; thus, the area has served as an important bridge between Madagascar and the outside world. Silting up of harbors on this coast, caused by sediment from the high levels of erosion suffered inland in Madagascar, is a major problem. The broad alluvial plains found on the coast between Mahajanga (Majunga) and Toliara (Tuléar), which are believed to have great agricultural potential, are thinly inhabited, in many places covered with swamps of [[Madagascar mangroves]], and remain largely unexplored, although they are the subject of mineral and [[hydrocarbon exploration]] activity. The giant [[Petroleum|oil]] fields of [[Tsimiroro]] (heavy oil) and [[Bemolanga]] (ultra heavy oil) lie towards the west of the island.&lt;ref name=LC/&gt;

===Southwest===

The southwest is bordered on the east by the Ivakoany Massif and on the north by the Isala Roiniforme Massif. It includes two regions along the south coast, the Mahafaly Plateau and the desert region occupied by the [[Antandroy]] people.&lt;ref name=LC/&gt;

==Rivers and lakes==
The [[Mananara River|Mananara]] and [[Mangoro River|Mangoro]] rivers flow from the central highlands to the east coast, as does the [[Maningory River|Maningory]], which flows from [[Lake Alaotra]]. Other rivers flowing east into the [[Indian Ocean]] include the [[Bemarivo River|Bemarivo]], the [[Ivondro River]], and the [[Mananjary River|Mananjary]]. These rivers tend to be short because the [[Drainage divide|watershed]] is located close to the east coast. Owing to the steep elevations, they flow rapidly, often over spectacular waterfalls.

The rivers flowing to the west coast discharging into the [[Mozambique Channel]], tend to be lengthier and flow more sluggishly due to the more gradual slope of the land. The major rivers on the west coast are the Sambirano, the [[Mahajamba river|Mahajamba]], the [[Betsiboka River|Betsiboka]] (the part of [[Mahajanga]] is located at the mouth), the [[Mania River|Mania]], the North and South Mahavavy, the [[Mangoky River|Mangoky]], and the [[Onilahy River|Onilahy]]. The [[Ikopa River|Ikopa]], which flows past [[Antananarivo]], is a tributary of the Betsiboka. The Mangoky River has a basin area of some {{convert|50000|km2|sqmi|0|sp=us}}; the Ikopa River and the Betsiboka River have basin areas of {{convert|18550|and|11800|km2|sqmi|0|sp=us}}. The Onilahy has a basin area of some {{convert|12435|km2|sqmi|0|sp=us}}, but being in the driest part of the island the Onilahy runs dry during certain months in dry years.

Important lakes, aside from Alaotra, include [[Lake Kinkony]] in the northwest, [[Lake Itasy]] in the center and [[Lake Ihotry]] in the southwest.

File:Lake Tritriva 01.jpg|[[Lake Tritiva]]
&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Soils==

Madagascar has been called the "Great Red Island" because of the prominence of red [[Laterite|lateritic]] soils. The red soils predominate in the central highlands, although there are much richer soils in the regions of former volcanic activity, [[Itasy Region|Itasy]] and [[Ankaratra]], and [[Tsaratanana]] to the north. A narrow band of [[alluvial]] soils is found all along the east coast and at the mouths of the major rivers on the west coast; clay, sand, and [[limestone]] mixtures are found in the west; and shallow or skeletal [[laterite]] and limestone are located in the south. [[Deforestation]] and grazing mean that the soils suffer from aggressive [[erosion]] in many locations.&lt;ref name=LC/&gt;

==Climate==
[[File:Madagascar map of Köppen climate classification.svg|thumb|300px|Madagascar map of Köppen climate classification]]
The climate is [[tropical]] along the coast, [[temperate]] inland, and [[arid]] in the south. The weather is dominated by the southeastern [[trade wind]]s that originate in the Indian Ocean [[anticyclone]], a center of high atmospheric pressure that seasonally changes its position over the ocean. Madagascar has two seasons: a warm, wet season from November to April; and a cooler, dry season from May to October. There is, however, great variation in climate owing to elevation and position relative to dominant winds. The east coast has an equatorial climate; being most directly [[orographic precipitation|exposed to the trade winds]] it has the highest rainfall, averaging as high as {{convert|4000|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} annually in some places depending on elevation (direction of slope on mountainsides), distance to the coast, and latitudinal location. This region is notorious for a hot, humid climate in which tropical fevers are endemic and also for the destructive cyclones that occur during the rainy season, coming in principally from the direction of the [[Mascarene Islands]]. Because rain clouds discharge much of their moisture east of the highest elevations on the island, the central highlands are drier and, owing to the altitude, also cooler. Thunderstorms are common during the rainy season in the central highlands and the eastern coastal lowlands.

Antananarivo receives practically all of its average annual {{convert|1400|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} of rainfall between November and April. The dry season is sunny, although somewhat chilly, especially in the mornings. Although frosts are rare in Antananarivo, they are common at higher elevations.

Although hail falls on many of the higher areas of the island (including Antananarivo), there is no snowfall except on the [[Ankaratra]] massif where above {{convert|2400|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} it may occasionally fall and even remain for several days.

The west coast is drier than either the east coast or the central highlands because the trade winds [[foehn effect|lose their humidity]] by the time they reach this region. The southwest and the extreme south are semidesert; as little as {{convert|330|mm|in|abbr=on}} of rain falls annually at [[Toliara]]. Overall, surface water is most abundant along the east coast and in the far north (with the exception of the area around Cap d'Ambre, which has relatively little surface water). Amounts diminish to the west and south, and the driest regions are in the extreme south.

Madagascar occasionally experiences the impact of cyclones. February 2–4, 1994, Madagascar was struck by [[Cyclone Geralda]], the worst cyclone to come ashore on the island since 1927. The cyclone killed seventy people and destroyed enough property to leave approximately 500,000 homeless, including 30,000 in Antananarivo and 80,000 in [[Toamasina]]. The cyclone also significantly damaged the country's infrastructure, most notably coastal roads, railroads, and telecommunications, as well as agriculture. Damage was estimated at US$45 million.

==Flora and fauna==
[[File:Adansonia grandidieri02.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Adansonia grandidieri|Baobabs]] near [[Morondava]]]]
{{see also|Fauna of Madagascar|Flora of Madagascar}}
The island of Madagascar has been described as an "alternate world" or a "world apart" because of the uniqueness and rarity of many of its plant and animal species. Their characteristics are believed to reflect the island's origins as a part of [[Gondwanaland]] and its many millions of years of isolation following the breakup of the landmass.

Many of the characteristic African species, large mammals as the elephant, rhinoceros, giraffe, zebra, and antelope and predators such as lions and leopards, do not exist in Madagascar. In addition, the island has been spared the great variety of venomous snakes indigenous to the African continent. Although it is assumed that most life forms on the island had an African (or South American) origin, isolation has allowed old species&amp;mdash;elsewhere extinct&amp;mdash;to survive and new species unique to the island to evolve. Thus, a great number of plant, insect, reptile, and fish species are [[endemism|endemic]] to Madagascar, and all indigenous land mammal species&amp;mdash;66 in all&amp;mdash;are unique to the island.

Madagascar was once covered almost completely by forests, but [[slash and burn]] practices for dry rice cultivation has denuded most of the landscape, especially in the central highlands. [[Rain forest]]s are concentrated on the steep hillsides along a slender north-south axis bordering the east coast, from the Tsaratanana Massif in the north to Tolagnaro in the south. Secondary growth, which has replaced the original forest and consists to a large extent of [[Ravenala madagascariensis|traveller's trees]], [[raffia palm]], and [[Adansonia|baobab]]s, is found in many places along the east coast and in the north. The vegetation of the central highlands and the west coast is for the most part savanna or steppe, and coarse prairie grass predominates where erosion has not exposed the orange-red lateritic soil. In the southwest, the vegetation is adapted to desert conditions.

The remaining rain forest contains a great number of unique plant species. The country has some 900 species of [[orchid]]. [[Banana]]s, [[mango]]es, [[coconut]], [[vanilla]], and other tropical plants grow on the coasts, and the [[eucalyptus]] tree, brought from [[Australia]], is widespread.

Wood and charcoal from the forests are used to meet 80% of domestic fuel needs. As a result, wood has become scarce. The World Bank in 1990 launched an environmental program that has increased the planting of pine and eucalyptus to satisfy fuel needs.

==Natural resources==

Madagascar has a number of natural resources, including [[graphite]], [[chromite]], [[coal]], [[bauxite]], rare Earth elements, [[salt]], [[quartz]], [[tar sands]], [[semi-precious]] stones and [[mica]]. There are also fishing areas offshore and potential for [[hydropower]]. 
In 2011, it was estimated that 5.96% of the land area was used for [[arable land]] and 1.02% had permanent crops. Twenty-six percent of the land is forested. 
The majority of the population depend on [[subsistence agriculture|subsistence farming]], largely [[rice]] and [[cattle]]. The manufacturing sector is small but growing.
It is very hard to grow plants here because of the dry land and desert climate.

==Environmental issues==

Madagascar is currently suffering in some areas from soil erosion as a result of [[deforestation]] and overgrazing, [[desertification]], and contamination of surface water with raw sewage and organic waste. Several species of flora and fauna that are unique to the islands are endangered. Regular cyclones cause flooding in low-lying coastal regions.

==Extreme points==

The tribe has a strong central authority structure and a long-established royal lineage. Bonny's development was also shaped by the tribe's close interaction with European traders. The [[Kingdom of Bonny]] was a major trading center from the 16th century onwards. The cult of the iguana (''ikuba'') also features strongly in Bonny cultural traditions. Historically, Bonny frequently engaged in wars against its nearby rivals, such as [[Elem Kalabari]] and [[Andoni people|Andoni]].&lt;ref&gt;Alagoa, Ebiegberi Joe (2005).

==Early life and education==
Mikucki earned her B.A. in 1996 at the [[University of North Carolina at Wilmington|University of North Carolina, Wilmington]], her M.S. in 2001 from [[Portland State University]], and her Ph.D in 2005 at [[Montana State University]].{{r|UT Profile}} A life-long love of cold and snow helped lead her to a career in Antarctic research.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/26/jobs/26pre.html |title=In Antarctica, the Thrill of Research Outweighs the Isolation |last=Mikucki |first=Jill |date=December 25, 2010 |newspaper=The New York Times |issn=0362-4331 |access-date=July 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mikucki conducted her Ph.D research on Blood Falls, a plume of iron-oxide rich water that flows from beneath the [[Taylor Glacier]] in the [[McMurdo Dry Valleys]] of Antarctica.

==Career and impact==
[[File:Jill Mikucki brine probe in video.png|thumb|left|Schematic of drilling to find the brine]]
[[file:Jill Milucki with brine in video larger.png|thumb|Mikucki with brine sample]]

As a postdoctoral fellow at [[Harvard University]] (2006–07) and [[Dartmouth College]] (2008), and a professor  at the University  of Tennessee,&lt;ref name="UT Profile"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://micro.utk.edu/faculty/mikucki.php |title=Dr. Jill Mikucki |website=Department of Microbiology, College of Arts &amp; Sciences, University of Tennessee |at=Click on "Education" tab |access-date=July 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mikucki continued her work at Blood Falls. Mikucki's work demonstrated that microbes can grow below ice in the absence of sunlight by using sulfate and iron  to help them metabolize organic matter.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Her continuing work at Blood Falls&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Byrd |first=Deborah |url=http://earthsky.org/earth/blood-falls-five-stories-high-seeps-from-an-antarctic-glacier |title=Origin of Antarctica's eerie Blood Falls |website=[[Earth &amp; Sky]] |access-date=July 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Gramling |first=Carolyn |title=Salty Water Lurks Beneath Antarctica |work=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |date=April 28, 2015 |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2015/04/salty-water-lurks-beneath-antarctica |access-date=August 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; led to the discovery of a network of salty groundwater beneath Antarctica's McMurdo Dry Valleys, which is likely the source of the Blood Falls outflow, and a habitat for subsurface microorganisms. The work was also the first ever use of airborne resistivity in Antarctica.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite press release |title=First-ever Use of Airborne Resistivity System in Antarctica Allows Researchers to Look Beneath Surface in Untapped Territories |date=March 12, 2012 |publisher=[[National Science Foundation]] |url=https://www.nsf.gov/news/news_summ.jsp?cntn_id=123620 |access-date=July 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mikucki was part of the first team to drill into and sample an Antarctic subglacial lake, which demonstrated the existence of life deep beneath Antarctic ice for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Schilling |first=Govert |title=Pay Dirt!

'''Karl Müller''' (1866&amp;ndash;1942) was a [[Czechs|Czech]] government official and amateur [[astronomer]].

He collaborated with [[Mary Adela Blagg]] on standardizing the nomenclature of formations on the [[Moon]] for the Lunar Commission of the newly formed [[International Astronomical Union]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The [[Impact crater|crater]] [[Müller (lunar crater)|Müller]] on the Moon is named after him.

'''"Katson sineen taivaan"''' ([[English Language|English]] translation: "I'm Looking at the Blue Sky") was the [[Finland|Finnish]] entry in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1979]], performed in [[Finnish Language|Finnish]] by [[Katri Helena]]. The song was composed by Matti Siitonen, better known under his stage name [[Fredi (singer)|Fredi]], who previously had taken part in the Contest in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1967|1967]] and [[Eurovision Song Contest 1976|1976]] as a singer, with the songs "[[Varjoon - suojaan]]" and "[[Pump-Pump]]" which finished 12th and 11th respectively.

The song was performed fifth on the night (following [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]'s [[Cathal Dunne]] with "[[Happy Man (Cathal Dunne song)|Happy Man]]" and preceding [[Monaco]]'s [[Laurent Vaguener]] with "[[Notre vie c'est la musique]]"). At the close of voting, it had received 38 points, placing 14th in a field of 19. Despite its moderate success in the Contest, the song is well remembered in Finland and counts as one of Katri Helena's signature tunes. The song has also been covered in the 2000s by other popular Finnish artists like rock band Jean S. and trance/dance act Transamerica feat. Katasha.

The song is an up-tempo track sung from the perspective of a woman singing to "the brightest star", and asking it to lead her; "''The child of the earth is looking for something - will she ever settle down?/Even a migrating bird finds a nesting tree instinctively./But the child of the earth keeps looking for something, sadness in her mind./I don't have any wings, but I must keep moving on./Will I ever find peace...? / I'm looking at the Blue Sky/the brightest star/ I ask you again/to lead me home.''" The English-language version of the song is titled "I Will Follow Starlight".

It was succeeded as [[Finland in the Eurovision Song Contest|Finnish representative]] at the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1980|1980 Contest]] by [[Vesa-Matti Loiri]] with "[[Huilumies]]". Katri Helena returned to the Contest in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1993|1993]] with "[[Tule luo]]".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="49962">The following are the Junior world records in [[Olympic weightlifting]]. They are the best results set in competition by athletes aged 15 to 20 throughout the entire calendar year of the performance. Records are maintained in each [[weight class]] for the [[snatch (weightlifting)|snatch]], [[Clean and jerk]], and total for both lifts by the [[International Weightlifting Federation]].

The recognition of the Junior classification and subsequent record keeping began in 1962 for men and 1995 for women. The first stand-alone Junior World Championships were held in 1975 for men and 1995 for women.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120128092103/http://ogv.asn.or.at/infos.htm Gottfried Schödl: ''Historisches Kalendarium''] {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2136">'''The French New Code of Civil Procedure''' is the name used to refer to the Code gathering all laws related to civil procedure in France between 1975 and 2007. It is now simply referred to as the Civil Procedure Code. 

== Adoption ==

The New Civil Procedure Code formally replaced the former Napoleonic Code of Civil Procedure of 1807 in accordance with Article 26 of the 20 December 2007 Legal Simplification Act (n 2007-1787)&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=LOI n° 2007-1787 du 20 décembre 2007  relative à la simplification du droit|date=20 December 2007|url=https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000017727195&amp;dateTexte=&amp;categorieLien=id|accessdate=2018-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The Napoleonic Civil Procedure Code had already undergone drastic changes since 1973, with the adoption of the Decree &lt;abbr&gt;n&lt;/abbr&gt; 75-1123&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Décret n° 75-1123 du 5 décembre 1975 instituant un nouveau code de procédure civile ‎Le nouveau code de procédure civile et son annexe font l'objet d'une publication spéciale  ‎‎(C.P.C. 1 à ‎‎60) annexée au Journal officiel de ce jour.‎|date=5 December 1975|url=https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000000507244&amp;categorieLien=id|accessdate=2018-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other legislative changes adopted in 2005&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Décret n° 2005-1678 du 28 décembre 2005 relatif à la procédure civile, à certaines procédures d'exécution et à la procédure de changement de nom|date=28 December 2005|url=https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000000815269&amp;categorieLien=id|accessdate=2018-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Changes introduced in the civil procedure legislation between 1973 and 2007 referred to the 'New' Civil Procedure Code as, despite the reforms, the old Napoleonic Civil Procedure Code still applied for parts and had not been officially abrogated. Since 2007 and the repealing of the Napoleonic Code, the current Civil Procedure Code is simply referred to as 'the Civil Procedure Code'.

'''Old Chang Kee''' ({{zh|c=老曾记|p=Lǎocéngjì}}) is an established [[snack]], food and beverage chain in [[Singapore]] specialising in [[curry puff]]s and other local snacks. Established in 1956, Old Chang Kee started off as a small stall outside Rex Cinema at [[McKenzie Road]] which still exists. Its current chairman, [[Han Keen Juan]] bought over the establishment which was about to fold up in 1986 and revived the business. The preparation to go [[halal]] began in 2004. On completion of all their documentation process, the Halal certification application was submitted at the end of October 2004. Old Chang Kee product, outlets and 2 central kitchens were officially certified ''Halal'' by [[Majlis Ugama Islam Singapura|MUIS]] on 7 January 2005.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

Old Chang Kee was one of the six winners of the SPBA Distinctive Brand Awards 2005 and also one of the Singapore Brand Award Heritage Award Winner 2005. Old Chang Kee is located at Woodlands Terrace(Singapore) as the only production ground necessary for Singapore.

Old Chang Kee is known for its [[curry puff]]s and introduced other types of curry puffs and snacks since 2005. That same year, the products underwent rebranding with its curry puffs renamed as Curry'O.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

There are eighty outlets operating across Singapore&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.straitstimes.com/business/companies-markets/puff-sales-lift-earnings-of-old-chang-kee|title=Puff sales lift earnings of Old Chang Kee|last=Chan|first=Dennis|date=29 May 2014|website=[[The Straits Times]]|access-date=2016-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; with three in [[China]], two in [[Malaysia]], four in [[Indonesia]] and three in the [[Philippines]].

The company was incorporated in Singapore on 16 December 2004 as a private limited company under the name Old Chang Kee Singapore Pte Ltd. On 22 November 2007, the Company changed its name to [[Old Chang Kee Ltd.]] in connection with its conversion into a public company limited. The company was listed on 16 January 2008 on Catalist-NS.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

[[Image:OpWall Logo.JPG|thumb|right|500px|Operation Wallacea logo]]

'''Operation Wallacea''' (known as '''Opwall''') is an organisation funded by tuition fees that runs a series of biological and conservation management research programmes operating in remote locations across the world. These expeditions are designed with specific wildlife conservation aims in mind—from identifying areas needing protection, through to implementing and assessing conservation management programmes. What is different about Operation Wallacea is that large teams of university academics, who are specialists in various aspects of [[biodiversity]] or social and economic studies, are concentrated at the target study sites giving volunteers the opportunity to work on a range of projects. The surveys result in a large number of publications in [[peer review|peer-reviewed journals]] each year, have resulted in 30 [[vertebrate]] species new to science being discovered, 4 '[[extinct]]' species being re-discovered and $2 million levered from funding agencies to set up best practice management examples at the study sites.

These large survey teams of academics and [[volunteering|volunteers]] that are funded independently of normal [[academia|academic]] sources have enabled large temporal and spatial [[biodiversity]] and [[socioeconomics|socio-economic]] data sets to be produced and provide information to help with organising effective [[conservation biology|conservation management]] programmes. Depending on the country, Opwall normally operates both [[marine (ocean)|marine]] and [[Landform|terrestrially]] based research expeditions, with a variety of research themes, whether they be [[biology|biological]], [[geological]], [[geographic]] or [[social science]] projects.

In 2012–2013, the expeditions are operating in 11 countries: [[Indonesia]], [[Honduras]], [[Cuba]], [[South Africa]], [[Peru]], [[Madagascar]], [[Guyana]], [[Mexico]] and [[Romania]]. In each country, a long-term agreement is signed with a partner organisation (e.g. ICF in [[Honduras]], Fund Amazonia in [[Peru]], Wildlife Ecological Investments in [[South Africa]], Fundatia ADEPT in [[Romania]]) and, over the course of this agreement, it is hoped to achieve a survey and management development programme at each of the sites. Occasionally, a competent local partner organisation is not available. In these cases, Operation Wallacea mentors the formation of a new [[Non-governmental organization|NGO]] comprising local staff who have provided successful input to the expedition surveys (e.g. Lawane Ecotone for the [[Indonesia]]n forest, Lembaga Alam for the [[Indonesia]]n marine sites and Expediciones y Servicios Ambientales de Cusuco for the [[honduras|Honduran]] [[cloud forest]]s).

==History==
Operation Wallacea first started operating expeditions to South East [[Sulawesi]], [[Indonesia]] in 1995. This region is known as the [[Wallacea]] region, after the work of the famous 19th Century naturalist [[Alfred Russel Wallace]] and the creation of [[wallace line|Wallace's line]] (the boundary separating the ecozones of Asia and Australia). It is from this scientifically important area that Operation Wallacea took its name.

This region was specifically chosen for three reasons:

'''a)''' Its high [[biodiversity]] and scientific importance, especially its high level of [[Ecoregion#Terrestrial|terrestrial]] [[endemism]], and its location in the major centre of [[biodiversity]] for [[scleractinia|Scleractinian corals]].

'''b)''' Increasing pressure and [[Human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] impact on important [[habitats]] including [[primary forest]] and [[coral reef]]s. [[Deforestation]], [[hunting]] and [[overfishing]] are important examples of these threats, and are specifically focused on by the work of Operation Wallacea.

'''c)''' The urgent need for [[Conservation movement|conservation]] to tackle these human pressures, due to a lack of existing [[Conservation movement|conservation]] and [[research]] effort in this region.

Much of Opwall's early work was concentrated in the [[Tukangbesi Islands|Tukangbesi archipelago]], conducting volunteer-led rapid assessments of large areas. This baseline data allowed the identification of key areas in need of urgent protection, and resulted in the establishment of the [[Wakatobi National Park|Wakatobi Marine National Park]] in 1996, the second largest marine park in [[Indonesia]], and protection of the Lambusango rainforests on the island of [[Buton]].

Much of this early work concentrated on establishing research bases at both the [[rainforest]] and [[Marine (ocean)|marine]] sites, and providing partner Indonesian [[Non-governmental organization|NGO]]'s with much needed data for the development of [[legislation]] and continued management of [[protected area]]s.

In 2003 Operation Wallacea's success in [[Indonesia]] attracted the attention of [[Non-governmental organization|NGO]]'s in [[Honduras]]. The result was the creation of new research sites in both the [[cloud forests]] of mainland [[Honduras]] and the [[coral reef]] clad islands of [[cayos cochinos|los Cayos Cochinos]]. Since then, expeditions have been set up in nine more countries, with the number of sites visited each year now totalling 25.

==Global research and conservation strategy==
The vast majority of science programmes that deliver key [[research]] outcomes are characterised by short-term funding with restricted aims and [[Biogeography|bio-geographical]] ranges. Long term projects covering large [[Biogeography|bio-geographical]] scales and that incorporate more than one [[ecosystem]] are rare. The Operation Wallacea programme provides the opportunity to consider [[science]] and [[Conservation movement|conservation]] of key [[ecosystems]] from a [[Earth|global]] perspective. Opwall is able to draw upon researchers from a wide range of different disciplines and academic institutions to address major issues related to the [[sustainable management]] and [[Conservation movement|conservation]] of some of the world's most diverse but threatened environments.

A global research and conservation strategy has been developed and is applied in 4 stages at each of the sites. After a site has been identified as a potential future research site, an initial assessment of the [[biology|biological]] value of the site is carried out (stage 1). If this initial assessment highlights a need for more detailed work, the site is accepted into the Opwall programme and an [[ecosystem]] monitoring programme is established to determine the direction of change (stage 2). This involves the collection of temporal data on [[ecosystem health]] and function and, if it reveals a continuing decline, a programme for monitoring [[socioeconomic|socio-economic]] change in adjacent communities is established to determine how these communities interact with the study site (stage 3). Once data from stage 2 and stage 3 are obtained, funding applications are submitted to establish a [[best practice]] example of [[Conservation movement|conservation]] management and the success of these programmes are then monitored (stage 4).

There is obviously considerable overlap between these stages and stage 1 projects can be running at the same time as a stage 4 programme in order to add data to understanding the [[ecosystem]] requirements of target species or adding to the overall species lists for previously un-worked [[taxa]].

==Example projects==
The ultimate aim of Operation Wallacea is to secure funding and implement [[Conservation movement|conservation]] programmes which are both successful and [[sustainable]]. This is a long and detailed progress, and relies heavily on the research and monitoring activities carried out at each site through the four stages of the Global Research and Conservation Strategy. A number of schemes have been implemented at several sites, and are at varying stages of completion. Some key examples of these are discussed below.

===REDD Scheme===
The [[Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation|REDD Scheme (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation in developing countries)]] is run by the [[United Nations]] in an effort to address both increasing [[greenhouse gas|carbon emissions]] and [[biodiversity]] loss through a single approach. The scheme involves payment to [[developing country|developing countries]] (with remaining intact forests) by [[developed country|developed countries]] (with high [[greenhouse gas]] emissions and high [[air pollution|reduction targets]]) to reduce [[deforestation]] and degradation rates which contribute to around 15% of global annual [[greenhouse gas|GHG emissions]]. The scheme has now attracted over US$4.5 billion in pledged funds. If successful, the donor countries can count the carbon saved towards their [[carbon budgets]].

Opwall scientists at a number of forest sites ([[Indonesia]], [[Mexico]], [[Honduras]], [[Madagascar]], [[Guyana]]) are currently collecting vital baseline data on [[carbon]] content so that [[Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation|REDD Scheme]] funding applications can be made. This will help bring much needed economic benefits to the local communities whilst also encouraging a reduction in [[deforestation]] and the associated [[biodiversity]] protection that comes with that.

===Wildlife Conservation Products===
A number of enhanced price schemes exist to boost the income for local farmers in [[developing country|developing countries]], based on various certification methods to ensure factors such as worker exploitation are upheld. However, no products exist which are qualified for based on the [[Conservation movement|conservation]] performance of the entire [[community]]. However, Operation Wallacea is supporting the [[Opwall Trust]] in developing [[trademark]]ed products under a scheme called Wildlife Conservation Products (WCP).

Communities can receive [[Fair Trade]] equivalent prices for their commodities only if they have signed a [[Conservation movement|conservation]] agreement. If there is evidence that village members are continuing to [[Hunting|hunt]] or [[deforestation|log]] the scheme is suspended until the community can exert the necessary pressure to prevent this activity. However, the payment of prices significantly above market rates in these communities provides a strong positive [[incentive]] for ensuring 'their' forest is protected.

The main benefit is that the enhanced price is paid not to a producers' [[cooperative|co-operative]], which normally comprises only a small percentage of the whole village, but to a village level [[cooperative|co-operative]] that must have 90% membership. The products are bought by the village [[cooperative|co-operatives]] from the local farmers at the normal market rates but are then sold onto the exporter at the enhanced WCP rates, which can produce a village level premium of up to 70% over the farm gate price. [[Coffee]] from the villages around the Lambusango and Cusuco sites run by Operation Wallacea were initially marketed under the Wicked Jungle Coffee brand. By cutting out middlemen and dealing directly with the farmer co-operatives, the prices paid for the products to the villages can be considerably higher than the Fair Trade rates but the final sale price in the western market can be comparable with Fair Trade. This scheme has great potential to substantially increase incomes in communities that are committed to protecting their adjacent forests and provides a market driven way of conserving forests.

==Research sites==

===Indonesia===

====Indonesia forest research====
Indonesia was the first site established by Operation Wallacea and was selected for two main reasons. Firstly, the forests of the Wallacea region of Indonesia, comprising the islands of the central part of the archipelago and which are separated from the islands to the east and west by deep ocean channels, are the most endemic-rich forests in the world.
The deep trenches prevented these islands from being joined to the main continental land masses during the lowered sea levels of the Ice ages. As a result of the long period of isolation, a large number of unique species have evolved. Moreover, the forests of central
Indonesia are one of the least studied areas biologically and one of the most likely places to discover vertebrate species new to science. Secondly, there is a triangle of reefs in eastern
Indonesia, part of which lies within the Wallacea region, that have the highest diversity of coral genera, the proxy commonly used to assess overall diversity of coral reefs.

The results of the Opwall forest surveys in central Buton Island, from where 21 vertebrate species new to science have been described, resulted in a $1 million World Bank/GEF grant being obtained to establish an example of best practice conservation management for a lowland forest. This project finished in 2008 and an assessment of the various quantifiable conservation targets showed that 90%+ of the targets had been achieved and in many cases significantly exceeded. Since the World Bank/GEF project was completed, Opwall has continued with monitoring the abundance and diversity of key taxa.

The Lambusango forests in the central part of Buton form the southern end of a continuous tract of forest that continues north through the remainder of the island and at the northern end is protected as the North Buton Nature Reserve. Despite this designation, virtually no data are available on the diversity of this Reserve and Opwall is establishing a field camp to start annual surveys from 2012 onwards in these northern forests. These data together with those from Lambusango can then be compiled into a Climate, Community and Biodiversity Alliance report that will make the Buton forests eligible for corporate sector funding under the REDD+ initiative. Corporate investors benefit by receiving Voluntary Carbon Scheme (VCS) credits and quantifiable benefits to biodiversity and poverty alleviation to surrounding communities from the annual REDD payments, which are based on performance in protecting the forests.

====Indonesia marine research====
Located in the heart of the Wakatobi Marine National Park is the Hoga Island Marine Research Centre, the most active research facility within this unique bioregion. The Coral Reef Research Unit (CRRU), based at Essex University (UK) and comprising marine biologists from universities around the world, is developing the Hoga Island Marine Research Centre as an internationally recognised centre for marine research. The CRRU has developed a thematic research programme with such research areas as coral reef dynamics, coral reef diversity, fisheries ecology and reef based economics, within which a series of research tasks are completed each year. To date, it has published nearly 50 scientific research papers within top-ranked, peer-reviewed journals and continues to attract international funding to support this research.

Recent success by Opwall in the Wakatobi has been achieved in the form of a sustainable fisheries programme (with funding from the Darwin Initiative). This took community based management and boat registration, combined with enhanced prices for existing products, to develop a method of best practice for the protection of important coral reef fisheries in Indonesia. The Wakatobi government has also recently invested £300,000 (US$460,000) to develop a marine research centre on Hoga to help improve the research activities further.

===Honduras===

====Honduras forest research====
In Honduras, the terrestrial research programme is run in conjunction with a Honduran NGO called ESAC (Expediciones y Servicios Ambientales de Cusuco). The purpose of this science programme is to provide data on socio-economics, forest structure and biodiversity (using indicator groups and population levels of key or threatened species) to assess the performance of the protected-area management. With the advent of funding mechanisms such as REDD+ (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation in Developing Countries), these annual biodiversity surveys have taken on an even more important role. The purpose of the REDD+ funding is to provide a marginal cost advantage for governments and communities to protect their forests rather than allow deforestation, thereby protecting their carbon sequestration value. The REDD+ funding is intended not just to protect the carbon value of the forests but also to protect its biodiversity and provide funds for poverty alleviation for communities surrounding or within the funded forest areas.

In recent years, general surveys and student projects have been divided across several teams, namely for plants by 'Botany', and animal teams divided into 'Birds', 'Small Mammals', 'Large Mammals', 'Herps' (reptiles and amphibians), and 'Inverts' (only insects and arachnids). In some cases, teams can merge sampling strategies for either ease of logistics, or more importantly for a more holistic understanding of ecology.
 
Data sets, such as those compiled by Opwall on the Cusuco National Park where changes in the diversity of key taxa or population levels of key species can be tracked, can be used to set additional biodiversity-related criteria for receiving REDD+ payments. There are few forests in Honduras that have the level of biodiversity data that has been collected on the Cusuco Park, which places the Park in prime position to receive such funding. The data collected to date on Cusuco have demonstrated that the Park contains 6 species of amphibian found only within the Park boundaries and a further 10 species of amphibian in the IUCN threatened category. In addition, a new genus of tree (Hondurodendron) has recently been described from the Park. In 2010, these data were compiled into a Climate, Community and Biodiversity Alliance report to make the Cusuco forests potentially eligible for REDD+ funding.

====Honduras marine research====
The marine research programme is run in conjunction with the Honduran Coral Reef Foundation (HCRF) for the Cayos Cochinos sites and the Coral View Research Centre and Bay Island Conservation Association (BICA) on Utila. Surveys are being completed on the reefs around the Cayos Cochinos Islands which are a Marine Protected Area (MPA) but where there are no mangroves to act as fish nurseries, and on the reefs and mangroves around Utila. The main research objective of this programme is to complete annual reef fish and coral community surveys using stereo video for the reef fish and video transects for the benthic communities. There are also unique reptile species found on Utila and the Cayos Cochinos Islands and long term ecological data sets are being gathered on these populations.

===South Africa===
Operation Wallacea and their South African partners, Wildlife and Ecological Investments
(WEI), are coordinating a large research programme on the impact of the expansion of elephant populations on the vegetation and associated diversity of key taxa. The South Africa research programme covers a series of reserves across the country, each using slightly different management strategies to tackle the problem of controlling their elephant populations. The majority of big game areas in South Africa are fenced in order to avoid conflicts between communities and dangerous animals. However, this restricts movement of species such as elephants, which can lead to excessive habitat damage within reserves where elephant feeding pressure is too high.

There are a number of different approaches being taken to the problem. The first question that needs addressing is how the carrying capacity of a reserve for elephants is calculated. This is not a question of how many elephants an area of land can hold before the populations starts to decline, because by the time this stage is reached, the habitat would have been almost completely destroyed by elephants. Rather, the term "carrying capacity" relates more to what the acceptable levels of damage are to a particular habitat type. In addition, it is important to consider the fact that elephants don't spread out evenly over the fenced areas but rather have preferred areas of feeding based on access to water or preferred trees, such as Marula. Thus the definition of acceptable levels of damage needs to be expressed in terms of percentage of total reserve area that has certain defined levels of serious damage. The Walker scale of elephant browsing pressure is being used by the Opwall teams to assess the levels of damage to trees and shrubs in different reserves at differing levels of elephant feeding pressure so that contours of similar levels of habitat damage can be defined for each of the reserves. Data are being gathered at a range of elephant grazing pressures so that estimates of levels of damage for a reserve with differing levels of elephant populations can be predicted.

Redefining what acceptable levels of elephant numbers are in a reserve is only one approach being used by managers of different reserves. Another approach is to expand the areas accessible to elephants. In KwaZulu Natal, a project called Space for Elephants is trying to persuade private game reserves to drop their fences to create contiguous areas. Private reserves constitute over 60% of the protected areas in South Africa, so projects such as this which encourage cooperation between the reserves through mutually beneficial practices can be hugely important for conservation management within southern Africa. In Pongola
Reserve, where parts of the reserve are subjected to huge grazing pressure, there is a move to open up an adjacent area of 1500ha to relieve the pressure on the reserve. Similarly, in
the nearby Thanda Reserve, there are parts where there have been elephants for a long period, parts where elephants gained access only in 2009 and a new area where small numbers of elephants were introduced in 2011. Dropping fences does not just allow elephants to expand their ranges, but also affects the distribution of other herbivores and predators. Long term data sets on the distribution of large mammal species in most of the study reserves are also being gathered and are revealing some interesting patterns.

Yet another approach to managing elephant populations is to control their increase in numbers by using contraception. In Pongola, the bulls have been vasectomised and there is a long term study looking at the impact this has on elephant social structure and behaviour.
Other reserves are using injections of PZP, an immunosuppressant, to provide contraception.

Changes in elephant numbers do not just affect the habitat but also, by changing the habitat, there is an effect on the diversity of other taxa. To examine this, studies on winter bird communities associated with differing levels of elephant habitat damage are being completed at 4 of the 5 reserves.

===Peru===
The Amazonian forests of Loreto, Peru are situated in the western Amazon basin and harbour some of the greatest mammalian, avian, floral and fish diversity on Earth. Operation Wallacea is joining a series of projects in this area that have been running since 1984 organised by Fund Amazonia and various conservation groups, universities and government agencies. The vision of these projects is to set up long-term biodiversity conservation using a combination of community-based and protected area strategies. The research and conservation activities use an interdisciplinary approach to find a balance between the needs of the indigenous people and the conservation of the animals and plants.

The objective for the 2012 season is to complete the annual high- and low-water season monitoring programmes for fish, caimans, turtles, macaws, exploited mammals and birds, dolphins, manatees and primates at the Pacaya Samiria National Reserve. Expeditions 1 – 2 are in the high water season when the forests are flooded, whilst those expeditions from late June are in the middle of the low water season.

The Pacaya Samiria National Reserve is the largest protected area in Peru spanning over
20,000 km2 of tropical rainforest and is a truly exceptional wilderness area. Situated deep in the rainforests of the western Amazon basin, at the point where the Amazon River begins its long journey to the Atlantic Ocean, the reserve teems with aquatic and terrestrial wildlife. The two major rivers that bind the reserve are the Ucayali and Marañon and they join to form the Amazon proper right at the point where the reserve begins. The huge floodplains of these majestic rivers have produced the low-lying flooded forests (Varzea) of the reserve, much of which is accessible on foot during the dry season surveys. The core areas of the reserve with no exploitation permitted are at the most upstream end. At the downstream end, there are communities of Cocama Indians who are involved in reserve management and managing resources in non-core zone areas sustainably.

The Samiria River that runs through the heart of the Pacaya Samiria National Reserve has a particularly large population of river dolphins and is the last remaining refuge for the Amazon manatee. Giant river otters are also returning and every year more are sighted in the rivers, lakes and channels. There are 12 species of primates in the Reserve, many of which are commonly sighted on the terrestrial and aquatic transects. Macaws and wading birds are very abundant, as are the game birds. Peccaries, deer, tapir and capybara are also on the increase and are often spotted during the terrestrial survey work, particularly when the water levels are high.

The Pacaya Samiria National Reserve is working with the local Cocama Indians to guarantee that both the natural and human worlds can co-exist in harmony. Whilst their dress has changed, the Cocama Indians still live as they did centuries ago. They fish and hunt for meat, collect forest fruits and have small slash and burn gardens. They travel in small dug out canoes and live in thatched-roof houses made from trees and palm fronds of the nearby forest. The work that the project is doing is helping to develop management plans that incorporate both the needs of the Cocama people and the conservation of wildlife in the Samiria river basin.

===Madagascar===

====Mahamavo====
As well as boasting some of the most spectacular biodiversity in the world (lemurs, tenrecs, baobabs, and over half of all known chameleon species), much of which is endemic, Madagascar has 3 very different forest ecosystem types: dry forest in the north, humid rainforest in the east, and spiny forest in the south. The Operation Wallacea surveys are currently concentrating on dry forests and associated wetlands of Mahamavo in the North, the spiny forest surrounding Ifotaka in the Mandrare Valley in the South and the dry forests and reefs of the Lokobe Reserve on Nosy Be Island.

The Mahamavo dry forest ecosystem and adjacent wetlands have exceptional biodiversity, but much remains to be discovered. Diurnal lemurs include Coquerel's Sifaka, Propithecus
coquereli and Common Brown Lemur, Eulemur fulvus with another 2 – 3 species of nocturnal lemurs. Madagascar is the global centre of diversity for chameleons. Several species can be found in Mahamavo including two spectacular large species, Furcifer oustaleti and Furcifer verrucosus. The wetlands support the critically endangered Madagascar Fish Eagle, Haliaeetus vociferoides, a flagship species for the area, and Humblot's Heron, Ardea humbloti, an endangered species.

The Mariarano forest provides livelihoods for several neighbouring communities in terms of agricultural land, fuel and construction wood as well as some wild food, hunting and medicinal plants. The wetlands in the coastal area support fisheries, which constitute the main resources for coastal communities. However, within this complex, areas of dry forest are managed for sustainable wood production in a way which is compatible with biodiversity conservation. In 2012, the Operation Wallacea teams will be completing a series of sample routes, covering the main protected forest areas and adjacent habitats. Data will be gathered on forest structure and communities of key taxonomic groups including birds, herpetofauna, small mammals such as tenrecs, rodents and bats, and lemurs. The output from this work will be used in a report submitted to the Madagascar government and will provide a baseline against which changes can be assessed in future years. The data will also be used to develop a Climate, Community and Biodiversity
Alliance report that can then be used by the Madagascar government to support an application under the REDD scheme to provide long term funding for this area.

===Guyana===
The Guiana Shield in South America is a massive granite dome that formed 2 billion years ago and forms what is now Guyana, Surinam, French Guiana and parts of Venezuela, Colombia and Brazil. Throughout most of this area there is a low human population density and as a result 2.5 million km2 of tropical rainforests still remain largely untouched along with extensive savannas and wetlands. The Operation Wallacea expeditions are working in Guyana – an English speaking country with some of the most pristine remaining forests, savannas and wetlands and where sightings of jaguar, tapirs, giant otters, harpy eagles and many other charismatic South American species are common. The expeditions to the interior of Guyana which involve trekking through undisturbed forests and lengthy river travel in canoes with temporary field camps on the river banks, are not for the faint hearted – this is true South American forest and a real expedition experience.

Operation Wallacea has formed a partnership with the Iwokrama International Centre for
Rainforest Conservation and Development (IIC) that manages one million acres (371,000ha) of undisturbed forests in the centre of the country. The IIC represents an international partnership between Guyana and the Commonwealth to demonstrate how tropical forests can be sustainably used in the interest of global scale climate change, local communities and biodiversity conservation. The Iwokrama Forest is divided into roughly half Sustainable Utilization Area (SUA), where sustainable use of forest resources are permitted and tested, and half Wilderness Preserve (WP), where there is no commercial extraction of forest resources.

Opwall have also partnered with Surama Village in the North Rupununi, is a primarily Makushi Amerindian community. Surama's vision is to develop, own and manage a community-based eco-tourism business by constructively using the natural resources and their traditional culture in a socially appropriate manner.

A monitoring programme providing equal coverage of the SUA and WP parts of the Iwokrama Forest as well as the forests surrounding Surama Village has been initiated, and is being completed annually by the Opwall survey teams. The purpose of this monitoring is to provide long-term data sets on the abundance and diversity of key biodiversity taxa so that the effects of sustainable use within Iwokrama and the forest surrounding Surama can be identified in comparison with the non-utilised wilderness areas. Over time, the effects of climate change and climate fluctuations (in particular El Niño Southern Oscillation patterns) should also be identifiable from these data sets. Additionally, these surveys provide survey coverage of parts of the Iwokrama Reserve and adjacent areas where there has been little previous survey work and may therefore provide additions to the species list for the area. There are now several derivatives of the Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation (REDD+) mechanism where biodiversity criteria are included in payments derived from REDD+ funding and these data may therefore be used for similar initiatives in Guyana

===Cuba===
The southern part of the Isle of Youth (Isla de la Juventud), the largest island off the coast of Cuba, is an area of significant biodiversity importance and is now being proposed as a Sustainable Use and Protected Area (APRM) whilst the western end has been designated as the Punta Frances National Park. The Punta Frances National Park contains mangroves, lagoons, semi-deciduous forests and coral reefs and forms an excellent example of relatively undisturbed and linked Caribbean habitats. Operation Wallacea, the Coral Reef Research
Unit at Essex University and the Centre for Marine Research at the University of Havana
(CIM-UH) have signed a long-term research collaboration agreement to develop and implement a biodiversity monitoring programme that will provide the data needed to inform conservation management practices across the whole of the southern island APRM.

In 2010, CIM-UH established a Research Centre in the Colony Marina that acts as the base for the surveys and also as a training centre for Cuban marine biology students. The survey work is based on research ships operating from the Research Centre. In 2012, the research objective is to complete fish and benthic surveys using video surveys of all the reefs of the southern Isla de la Juventud APRM and to assess the manatee populations by direct observation and side scan sonar in the mangrove channels.

===Mexico===

====Mexico forest research====
The Calakmul Biosphere Reserve in Mexico is a huge expanse of tropical forest that is continuous with the Maya Biosphere Reserve in the Peten Province of Northern Guatemala. Collectively, this forest spans over 7.5 million hectares and is the largest section of tropical forest north of the Amazon. This stretch of forest was also home to the two largest ancient Mayan cities of Tikal in Guatemala and Calakmul in Mexico during the classic period in ancient Mayan history (400AD – 900AD), plus one of the oldest ancient Mayan cities El Mirador which dates back to the pre-classic period (600BC – 300BC). Today, the extensive pyramids and ruined cities lie sprawled through the dense jungle, with some of the taller pyramids towering above the canopy at 65m in height. It is these pyramids that gave Calakmul its name. Wildlife in Calakmul includes jaguar, puma, ocelot, jaguarundi, tapir, brocket deer, peccary, howler and spider monkeys in addition to over 50 species of reptile and amphibian and 350 species of resident and migratory birds, including abundant parrots, toucans and the endemic ocellated turkey.

The Calakmul Biosphere Reserve covers an area of 723,000 hectares but is attached to two state reserves, Balam-kim and Balam-ku, which run the entire length of the western side of the biosphere. The total area covered by these connected reserves is 1.2 million hectares. Unlike the majority of forest in the Yucatán, the forest in Calakmul has not been used for timber production nor has it been burned for farming and ranching and, as such, it is one of the last remaining stands of virgin forest in Mexico. The northern parts of Calakmul contains tropical deciduous forest, where trees typically have a canopy 8–20m high and lose their leaves in the dry season (December to May), but the majority of the reserve contains tropical semi-deciduous trees. Tropical semi-deciduous forests have a canopy ranging between 15–40m in height although the majority of trees are from 20-30m. The canopy can be closed or partially open and in the dry season, 20% to 40% of the trees lose their leaves. Calakmul also contains numerous temporary lakes known as aguadas, which form during the rainy season and may last well into the dry season.

The Calakmul Biosphere Reserve forms one part of the proposed Mesoamerican Biological Corridor spanning Belize, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua and Panama. Creating such forest corridors are extremely important for ensuring gene flow between animal populations and for ensuring that populations can withstand natural disasters such as droughts, forest fires, hurricanes and floods. Seeing as Mexico and Central America experience all four of these extreme conditions, forest connectivity is extremely important. Forest connectivity is also crucial for animals with extensive ranging patterns such as jaguar.

The primary objective of the Operation Wallacea project is to quantify the carbon storage value of the forests and to produce annual data on the biodiversity of key taxa. These data are being used to draft a report using the Climate, Community and Biodiversity Alliance standards so the forests can be submitted for funding under the Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation scheme (REDD+). Another focus of the project relates specifically to the large mammals. Calakmul and the connected Mayan Biosphere Reserve in Guatemala is the largest stronghold for jaguar and tapir. However, with rapidly growing buffer zone communities, hunting of forest mammals is a major concern for the reserve. [[Pro-Natura International]] have been working with local communities to educate them about sustainable hunting of fast producing mammals that live in relatively high densities such as peccary and deer rather than slow-reproducing mammals that live in low densities such as tapir. The Opwall surveys in Calakmul are also producing annual data on population density of the large mammal species in order to calculate sustainable hunting quotas for buffer zone communities.

====Mexico marine research====
Akumal is a small coastal town located approximately 1.5 hours drive south from the major tourist destination of Cancun. The name Akumal literally means "home of the turtles" in Maya. It earned this name due to the numerous turtle nesting sites along the bays located in the Akumal area and due to the permanent presence of juvenile turtles in the sea grasses just off shore. Three species can regularly be found around Akumal. Local beaches are nesting grounds for two of these species: the Loggerhead Turtle (Caretta caretta) and the Green Turtle (Chelonia mydas). There are juvenile Green Turtles feeding in the bays year round and sometimes Hawksbill Turtles (Eretmochelys imbricate) around the reef.

Although Akumal itself is a very small town, there are a number of private residences in South Akumal and an enormous hotel that has over 2000 rooms. In addition, there are plans to build 25,000 new homes in the Akumal area but the plans do not include any provision for waste water treatment. The area has many underground rivers, due to the characteristic high permeability and porosity of the soil karst of the Yucatán Peninsula and without adequate waste water management, each of the 25,000 homes will empty their waste water directly into the underground river systems that flow into Yal Ku Lagoon and out to sea.

Centro Ecologico Akumal (CEA) is a Mexican NGO that is responsible for managing 50&amp;nbsp;km of coastline that covers some of the most important turtle nesting sites in the Caribbean and providing advice to the state of Quintana Roo on ecologically sensitive town planning. In order to do this, CEA needs to provide baseline data relating to water quality in the cenotes, lagoons and reefs, biodiversity of the reefs, the turtle population and beach erosion. Variation in these environmental factors in relation to proximity to hotels and residences will provide evidence of the effect of improperly managed tourism and human developments on the coastal ecosystem. In addition, long-term monitoring protocols of these factors need to be put in place to ensure that any future developments do not worsen conditions. The main research objective for the Opwall teams at Akumal is to establish an annual monitoring programme for the coral and reef fish communities, including data on sedimentation levels. In addition, annual monitoring of the juvenile turtle population and availability of suitable nesting sites will be conducted.

===Transylvania===
The Saxon communities of the lowland Carpathian mountains have been managing the Transylvanian landscape in a traditional manner since the 12th Century. Each of the 200 Saxon villages in the foothills of the Carpathians had a distinctive fortified church where the villagers took refuge in times of threat. The layout of these villages has remained virtually unchanged since the 18th century with village houses on either side of the valley stream and each house having a strip of land at the rear. In addition, each household traditionally has strips of arable land and damp hay meadow in the valley bottom and larger parcels of hay meadow further up the valley. Taking a cross section through the valleys of this region, the villages and arable strips of land would be found in the valley bottom with hay meadows and pasture for cattle and sheep above. Forest still blankets the steeper slopes of the valley.

Cattle and sheep are owned by different households but grazed on the common unfenced pasture areas with a cowherd and shepherds accompanying them. The cows return each night to their owners in the village and are milked in the courtyards before being turned out the following morning and grazed under the supervision of an elected cowherd on the lower pastures. Sheep are turned out in May and graze the upper pastures in large flocks with shepherds and do not return to the valley bottom until the onset of winter in November. The sheep are milked by the shepherds high in the valleys and the milk used for cheese making. At night, the sheep are fenced in sheepfolds with the shepherds sleeping at spaces around them to prevent bear or wolf attacks.

This traditional form of farming has produced a High Nature Value landscape and in 2008 the European Union declared 250,000 ha of the Carpathian valleys as the Tarnava Mare Natura 2000 site with the whole area receiving protection as a Site of Community Importance (SCI) under the Birds Directive and 85,000 ha as a Special Conservation Area (SCA) under the Habitats Directive. The objective of these designations is to protect the traditional uses of the landscape that have produced this species-rich mosaic of habitats and species. The valleys contain the last lowland population of European Brown Bears (closely related to the American grizzly and more than 4000 animals remaining) as well as Wolves and threatened bird species, such as the Lesser Spotted Eagle, Corncrake and Woodlark, whilst the mainly oak and hornbeam forest areas contain 9 species of woodpecker as well as the spectacular Ural Owl. The upland hay meadows, which have not been fertilised for centuries, contain a very diverse grassland flora and associated butterfly species whilst the wet grass areas contain Great Burnet, the host plant for the Scarce Large Blue and Dusky Large Blue butterflies.

This Saxon landscape and its associated populations of European flora and fauna, once seen over much of lowland Europe, is under significant threat. In the 1990s, many of the Saxons returned to Germany and their houses and farmsteads were allocated to other ethnic groups (Roma, Hungarians and Romanians) who were not experienced in the traditional farming techniques that had been practiced by the Saxons for centuries. Opwall is partnered with a local NGO, Fundatia ADEPT, which initially helped make the case for the Natura 2000 designation and helped the design of EU farm payments to protect this area. ADEPT and Opwall are now establishing an annual monitoring programme to assess the effectiveness of the designation and farm payments in protecting the high conservation value of the landscape.

'''The Pacific Basin Economic Council''' (PBEC) is an influential independent business association founded by [[Weldon B. Gibson]] in 1967 with the objective of facilitating business in the Asia - Pacific region. It is currently located in Hong Kong and the Chief Executive is Deborah Biber.

==History==
The [[Institute of Pacific Relations]] (IPR) was founded in 1925 as an international forum where national delegations representing a broad range of interests could meet and discuss both domestic and regional issues.
The IPR was a respected forum in the period before, during and after [[World War II]], but was disbanded in 1961 after the United States withdrew support.{{sfn|Woods|1993|p=7-8}}
The PBEC was one of the organizations that filled the void.  It was founded in 1967 by business leaders from the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and Japan. Later the founders were joined by groups of members  from other countries in the region such as South Korea, Mexico, Hong Kong, Malaysia and the Philippines.{{sfn|Woods|1993|p=8}}

The purpose of the Pacific Basin Economic Council is to create and maintain an environment that facilitates the orderly conduct of business.{{sfn|Woods|1993|p=8}}  
The organization is funded by its corporate members.{{sfn|Myers|Oksenberg|Shambaugh|2001|p=166}}
The organization is informal in the sense that it does not include official government representation.{{sfn|Noland|1990|p=139}}
At the council's 12th general meeting in Los Angeles in 1978 the Pacific Economic Community Plan was proposed, calling for an economic community to coordinate solidarity and cooperation between countries of the region at different stages of development.{{sfn|Harvard University|1986|p=102-103}}
As of 1993 the PBEC was the main non-government organization involved in economic cooperation in the Pacific region.{{sfn|Woods|1993|p=66}}

==Activities==

The Pacific Basin Economic Council promotes an improved business climate for all members in the region. It advises governments on ways to improve their business environment and to reduce trade barriers. It helps generate foreign investment and encourages new technology development and deployment while avoiding environmental degradation where possible.{{sfn|Myers|Oksenberg|Shambaugh|2001|p=166}}

Serving as the independent voice of business in the Pacific, PBEC provides a meeting place for the diversity of industries, services and professions that have made the Pacific Basin the world's growth leader. PBEC has been a driving force in the region for the past four decades, advocating environmental awareness, corporate social responsibility, and transparency though working committees, policy advocacy, and partnerships with organizations such as the [[Asian Development Bank]] (ADB) / [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] ([[OECD]]) Anti-corruption Initiative, [[Pacific Economic Cooperation Council]] ([[PECC]]), [[Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation]] ([[APEC]]), and the [[United Nations Global Compact]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pbec.org/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''RTL Radio''' is a German commercial radio station based in [[Berlin]] and the part of the [[RTL Group]]. It originated as the German language service of [[Radio Luxembourg]], which began broadcasting after [[World War II]] from [[Grand Duchy of Luxembourg|Luxembourg]]. It broadcasts [[adult contemporary music]] nationally via cable, satellite and internet and regionally via [[FM broadcasting|FM]] in Luxembourg, [[Rheinland-Pfalz]], [[Saarland]], eastern [[Belgium]], and [[Lorraine]]. 

==History==
[[File:EU_location_LUX.png|thumb|right|250px|Location of Luxembourg (circled).]]
RTL Radio began broadcasting as the German service of Radio Luxembourg on 15 July 1957. Along with the Saarland-based pirate radio Europe 1, Luxembourg interfered with the non-commercial monopoly imposed by the German states since broadcasting first started in the country. Apart from advertising reaching German radios for the first time, RTL also introduced Germans from both East and West to rock-and-roll music which contrasted to the classical repertoire that dominated mainland services.

In 1990, Radio Luxembourg was renamed RTL Hörfunk. On 1 July 2015 RTL Radio branded itself ''RTL Radio – Deutschlands Hit-Radio'' and moved its studios from the [[City of Luxembourg]] to [[Berlin]]. 

RTL Radio has slots on analog and digital cable, and transmits digital signals via the [[Astra (satellite)|Astra]] 1L satellites.

The '''U.S.-China Senior Dialogue''' (also known as the '''China-U.S. Strategic Dialogue''') was a regular, high-level strategic dialogue between the [[United States]] and the [[People's Republic of China]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/r/pa/scp/87166.htm|title=We're sorry, that page can't be found.|author=|date=|website=www.State.gov|access-date=May 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Senior Dialogue has been upgraded to the strategic track of the [[U.S.-China Strategic and Economic Dialogue|Strategic and Economic Dialogue]] in the Obama administration and will be headed by [[Hillary Clinton]] and [[Dai Bingguo]].{{Update inline|date=May 2017}}

==Purpose==
The Senior Dialogue was conceived at a 2004 [[APEC]] meeting, after a suggestion made by Chinese President [[Hu Jintao]] to U.S. President [[George H. W. Bush]] to create a forum where the global superpower and emerging global player could come together and discuss issues of mutual concern. The typically two-day rounds help establish a framework for bilateral cooperation between the two countries, and give the U.S. an opportunity to shape China's impact on the world as its economy continues to industrialize.

Integrating China into the world's security, economic and political systems continues to be the U.S.'s current policy in dealing with China's rise on the global sphere. However, China's current international economic policies are increasingly rankling American workers and businesses, among others around the world who consider China's trade practices unfair. On June 13, 2007, four U.S. senators introduced a bill that would pressure China to allow its currency to rise in value, which would help close the huge U.S. trade deficit with China, which hit a record $233 billion in 2006. However, Treasury Secretary [[Henry Paulson]] believes in pursuing a less confrontational and non-protectionist approach.

==Meetings==
* 1st round: [[Beijing]] in August 2005
* 2nd round: [[Washington, D.C.]] in December 2005
* 3rd round: Beijing in October 2006
* 4th round: Washington, DC in June 2007
* 5th round: [[Guiyang]] in January 2008
* 6th round: Washington, DC in December 2008

===1st round===
The first round, co-chaired by former Deputy Secretary of State [[Robert Zoellick]] and [[Dai Bingguo]] on August 1–2, 2005, addressed issues such as trade and economic issues, energy security, cooperation against terrorism, democracy, and human rights.

===2nd round===
The second round took place three months later, on December 7–8, 2005, between Zoellick and Dai, and addressed Iraq, Afghanistan, Iran, North Korea, Africa, terrorism, non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, energy security, and the risks of pandemic disease. Human rights, democracy, and the U.S.-China trade imbalance were also discussed.

===3rd round===
The third round of talks concluded on November 8, 2006, between former Undersecretary of State [[R. Nicholas Burns|Nicholas Burns]] and Chinese Vice Foreign Minister [[Yang Jiechi]]. Issues of discussion included North Korea, Iran, Darfur, Burma, APEC, and UN reform.

===4th round===
Chinese and U.S. diplomats met on June 20–21, 2007 in Washington, D.C. to convene the fourth round of the Senior Dialogue - bilateral talks between the U.S. and China ongoing since August 2005.

Senior Dialogue leaders Deputy Secretary of State [[John Negroponte]] and Executive Vice Foreign Minister Dai Bingguo met in 2007 for closed-session talks to discuss U.S.-China relations, and a range of global issues from Northeast Asian regional security, to Iran and Darfur.

Before the fourth round of talks began, the two leaders warmly exchanged welcomes and hopes for an optimistic outcome.

"This is part of the Senior Dialogue between ourselves and China," Negroponte began. "It's the first one that I'm having an opportunity to lead from the United States side. We look very much forward to our discussions over the next day and I'm delighted to welcome my counterpart from China, Mr. Dai Bingguo here to the Department of State."{{Cite quote|date=May 2017}}

Dai thanked the mostly Asian news organizations in attendance before replying in Chinese, "This is also the first time that I will be meeting Mr. Negroponte and I hope we achieve a satisfactory result."{{Cite quote|date=May 2017}}

'''[[Telephone tapping]] in the countries of the [[Eastern Bloc]]''' was a widespread method of the [[mass surveillance]] of the population by the [[secret police]].{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

==History==
In some countries, this was an open and legal practice. During [[martial law in Poland]], official censorship was introduced, including  open phone tapping.  In fact, the [[Służba Bezpieczeństwa|Polish secret police]] did not have resources to monitor all conversations, despite the introduction of the new censorship division.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ipn.gov.pl/portal.php?serwis=pl&amp;dzial=345&amp;id=4232&amp;poz=3 Martial Law in Poland] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071014181417/http://www.ipn.gov.pl/portal.php?serwis=pl&amp;dzial=345&amp;id=4232&amp;poz=3 |date=2007-10-14 }} {{pl icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Communist Romania|Romania]], [[telephone]] tapping was conducted by the General Directorate for Technical Operations of the [[Securitate]].  Created with [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] assistance in 1954, the outfit monitored all voice and electronic [[communication]]s in and out of Romania. They [[Covert listening device|bugged]] telephones and intercepted all [[telegraph]]s and [[teleprinter|telex]] messages, as well as placing [[microphone]]s in both public and private buildings.{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}}

==Fiction==
The 2006 film ''[[The Lives of Others]]'' concerns a [[Stasi]] man who is telephone-tapping a suspected dissident writer.

The 1991 [[Poland|Polish]] comedy film ''[[Rozmowy kontrolowane]]'' (''Monitored Conversations'')&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|0102815|Rozmowy kontrolowane}}&lt;/ref&gt; capitalizes on this fact. The title alludes to the pre-recorded phrase "Rozmowa kontrolowana" ("The talk is being monitored") a person repeatedly hears during a phone conversation.

[[File:Giovanni Boccaccio's Filocolo.gif|thumb|Illumination from a manuscript of ''Il Filocolo'' (Oxford, [[Bodleian Library]], Ms. Canon. Ital. 85, fol. 114v)]]
'''''The Filocolo''''' (orig. '' Il Filocolo'') is a [[novel]] written by [[Giovanni Boccaccio]] between 1335-36. It is considered to be the first novel of Italian literature written in prose. It is based on a very popular story of the time, ''[[Floris and Blancheflour|Florio e Biancifiore]]''.

"The Franklin's Tale" of [[Geoffrey Chaucer]]'s ''[[The Canterbury Tales]]'' is based on ''The Filocolo''.

This work dates from Boccaccio's youth; it was written during his stay in Naples in 1336.

The two protagonists are Florio, son of the King of Spain, and Biancifiore, an orphan. Having grown up together they are in love, and they are forced to undergo many adventures and misfortunes that divide them. In the end, after Florio's many journeys in search of his love under the pseudonym of Filocolo, they are reunited.

During a stay in Naples, Florio, thwarted by a tempest at sea, is walking near the tomb of Virgil, where he finds himself attracted by the melody coming from a neighbouring garden. Here he encounters Caleone (who represents Boccaccio himself), who is part of a "noble brigade" and invites Florio to join them. Another member of the group is [[Fiammetta]] (Maria d'Aquino) who is elected their queen. Each of the group in turn proposes a question of love. This section is particularly significant because it foreshadows the scheme of the ''[[The Decameron|Decameron]]''.

The material is drawn from popular tradition; the adventures of Florio and Biancifiore were as well known in Europe as those of [[Tristan and Iseult|Tristan and Isolde]]. In Italy there was a popular poem in ''[[ottava rima]]'' entitled ''Cantare di Florio e Biancifiore''. Boccaccio, however, made a distinctive version of the story, inaugurating his new prose style.

==Etymology==
{{Main|Name of Turkey}}
The English name of Turkey (from [[Medieval Latin]] ''Turchia''/''Turquia''&lt;ref name=arlen&gt;{{cite book|title=Passage to Ararat|author= Michael J. Arlen|publisher=MacMillan|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-UahAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA159|page=159|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;) means "land of the Turks". [[Middle English]] usage of ''Turkye'' is evidenced in an early work by [[Chaucer]] called ''[[The Book of the Duchess]]'' (c. 1369). The phrase ''land of Torke'' is used in the 15th-century [[The Digby Conversion of Saint Paul|Digby Mysteries]]. Later usages can be found in the [[William Dunbar|Dunbar poems]], the 16th century ''[[Manipulus Vocabulorum]]'' ("Turkie, Tartaria") and [[Francis Bacon]]'s ''Sylva Sylvarum'' (Turky). The modern spelling "Turkey" dates back to at least 1719.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite OED|Turkey}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Turkish language|Turkish]] name ''Türkiye'' was adopted in 1923 under the influence of European usage.&lt;ref name=arlen/&gt;

The Anatolian peninsula, comprising most of modern Turkey, is one of the oldest permanently settled regions in the world.

The earliest recorded inhabitants of Anatolia were the [[Hattians]] and [[Hurrians]], non-Indo-European peoples who inhabited central and eastern Anatolia, respectively, as early as ca. 2300 BC.

Starting around 1200 BC, the coast of Anatolia was heavily settled by [[Aeolians|Aeolian]] and [[Ionians|Ionian]] [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]]. Numerous important cities were founded by these colonists, such as [[Miletus]], [[Ephesus]], [[Smyrna]] (now [[İzmir]]) and [[Byzantium]] (now [[Istanbul]]), the latter founded by [[Greeks|Greek]] colonists from [[Megara]] in 657 BC. The first state that was called [[Armenia]] by neighbouring peoples was the state of the [[Armenians|Armenian]] [[Orontid dynasty]], which included parts of eastern Turkey beginning in the 6th century BC.

In the latter half of the 11th century, the Seljuk Turks began penetrating into [[medieval Armenia]] and the eastern regions of Anatolia. In 1071, the Seljuks defeated the Byzantines at the [[Battle of Manzikert]], starting the [[Turkification]] process in the area; the Turkish language and [[Islam]] were introduced to Armenia and Anatolia, gradually spreading throughout the region. The slow transition from a predominantly [[Christian]] and [[Greek language|Greek]]-speaking Anatolia to a predominantly [[Muslim]] and Turkish-speaking one was underway. The [[Mevlevi Order]] of [[dervishes]], which was established in [[Konya]] during the 13th century by [[Sufi]] poet [[Celaleddin Rumi]], played a significant role in the [[Islamization]] of the diverse people of Anatolia who had previously been [[Hellenized]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Davison|first1=Roderic H.|title=Essays in Ottoman and Turkish History, 1774–1923: The Impact of the West|date=2013|publisher=University of Texas Press|isbn=978-0292758940|pages=3–5|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NQvUAAAAQBAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Katherine Swynford Lambton|editor1-first=Ann|editor2-last=Lewis|editor2-first=Bernard|title=The Cambridge history of Islam|date=1977|publisher=Cambridge Univ.

These were initially about Ottoman territorial expansion and consolidation in southeastern and eastern Europe; but starting from the [[Russo-Turkish War (1768–74)|latter half of the 18th century]], they became more about the survival of the Ottoman Empire, which had begun to lose its strategic territories on the northern [[Black Sea]] coast to the advancing Russians.

During the "[[First Constitutional Era]]", the constitution and parliament had been suspended by Sultan [[Abdul Hamid II]]. Thirty years later, the [[Young Turk Revolution]] of 1908 [[Second Constitutional Era|restored the Ottoman constitution]] and [[General Assembly of the Ottoman Empire|parliament]], but the [[1913 Ottoman coup d'état]] effectively put the country under the control of the [[Three Pashas]], making sultans [[Mehmed V]] and [[Mehmed VI]] largely symbolic figureheads with no real political power.

The Ottoman Empire entered [[World War I]] on the side of the [[Central Powers]] and was ultimately defeated. During the war, the empire's Armenians were [[Tehcir Law|deported]] to [[Syria]] as part of the [[Armenian Genocide]].

The [[occupation of Constantinople|occupation of Istanbul]] (1918) and [[Occupation of Smyrna|Izmir]] (1919) by the Allies in the aftermath of World War I prompted the establishment of the [[Turkish National Movement]]. Under the leadership of [[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk|Mustafa Kemal]] [[Pasha]], a military commander who had distinguished himself during the [[Battle of Gallipoli]], the [[Turkish War of Independence]] (1919–1923) was waged with the aim of revoking the terms of the Treaty of Sèvres.&lt;ref name="Atatürk"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Atatürk: The Biography of the Founder of Modern Turkey|first=Andrew|last=Mango|publisher=Overlook|year=2000|isbn=978-1-58567-011-6|page=lxxviii}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 November 1922, the Turkish Parliament in [[Ankara]] formally [[Abolition of the Ottoman Sultanate|abolished the Sultanate]], thus ending 623 years of monarchical Ottoman rule.

==Administrative divisions==
{{Main|Administrative divisions of Turkey}}
{{Further|Regions of Turkey|NUTS of Turkey}}

Turkey has a [[unitary state|unitary]] structure in terms of administration and this aspect is one of the most important factors shaping the Turkish public administration. When three powers (executive, legislative and judiciary) are taken into account as the main functions of the state, local administrations have little power. Turkey doesn't have a [[federalism|federal]] system, and the provinces are subordinate to the central government in Ankara. Local administrations were established to provide services in place and the government is represented by the province governors (''vali'') and town governors (''kaymakam''). Other senior public officials are also appointed by the central government instead of the mayors (''belediye başkanı'') or elected by constituents.&lt;ref name=justice.gov.tr&gt;{{cite web|title=General Structure of Turkish Public Administration|url=http://www.justice.gov.tr/judicialsystem.pdf|website=justice.gov.tr/|publisher=Ministry of Justice|access-date=14 August 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150321203401/http://www.justice.gov.tr/judicialsystem.pdf|archivedate=21 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Turkish municipalities have local legislative bodies (''belediye meclisi'') for decision-making on municipal issues.

Within this unitary framework, Turkey is subdivided into 81 [[Provinces of Turkey|provinces]] (''il'' or ''vilayet'') for administrative purposes.

Between 1923 and 2018, Turkey was a [[parliamentary system|parliamentary]] [[representative democracy]]. A [[presidential system]] was adopted by [[Turkish constitutional referendum, 2017|referendum in 2017]]; the new system came into effect with the [[Turkish presidential election, 2018|presidential election in 2018]] and gives the President complete control of the [[executive (government)|executive]], including the power to issue decrees, appoint his own cabinet, draw up the budget, dissolve parliament by calling early elections, and pack the bureaucracy and the courts with political appointees.&lt;ref name="EconPres2018"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.economist.com/europe/2018/06/30/erdogan-inaugurates-a-new-political-era-in-turkey|title=Recep Tayyip the First: Erdogan inaugurates a new political era in Turkey|publisher=The Economist|date=28 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The office of [[Prime Minister of Turkey|Prime Minister]] has been abolished and its powers (together with those of the [[Cabinet of Turkey|Cabinet]]) have been transferred to the President, who is the [[head of state]] and is elected for a five-year term by direct elections.&lt;ref name="EconPres2018"/&gt; [[Recep Tayyip Erdoğan]] is the first president elected by direct voting. [[Constitution of Turkey|Turkey's constitution]] governs the legal framework of the country. It sets out the main principles of government and establishes Turkey as a unitary centralised state.

Executive power is exercised by the President, while the [[legislature|legislative]] power is vested in the unicameral parliament, called the Grand National Assembly of Turkey. The [[judiciary]] is nominally independent from the executive and the legislature, but the constitutional changes that came into effect with the referendums in [[Turkish constitutional referendum, 2007|2007]], [[Turkish constitutional referendum, 2010|2010]] and 2017 gave larger powers to the President and the [[ruling party]] for appointing or dismissing [[judge]]s and [[prosecutor]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-44574919|title=Turkey elections: How powerful will the next Turkish president be?|publisher=BBC|author=Chris Morris|date=22 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Constitutional Court of Turkey|Constitutional Court]] is charged with ruling on the conformity of [[Legal System in the Republic of Turkey|laws and decrees]] with the constitution.

[[Universal suffrage]] for both sexes has been applied throughout Turkey since 1933 and before most countries, and every Turkish citizen who has turned 18 years of age has the right to vote. There are 600 [[Member of Parliament|members of parliament]] who are elected for a four-year term by a [[party-list proportional representation]] system from 85 electoral districts.

Supporters of Atatürk's reforms are called [[Kemalism|Kemalists]], as distinguished from [[Islamism|Islamists]], representing the two diverging views regarding the role of religion in [[legislation]], education and public life.&lt;ref name="FleetFaroqhi2008p357"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Kate Fleet|author2=Suraiya Faroqhi|author3=Reşat Kasaba|title=The Cambridge History of Turkey|url={{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=iOoGH4GckQgC |page=357 }} |access-date=13 June 2013|date=17 April 2008|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-62096-3|pages=357–358}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Human rights in Turkey]] have been the subject of some controversy and international condemnation. Between 1998 and 2008 the [[European Court of Human Rights]] made more than 1,600 judgements against Turkey for human rights violations, particularly regarding the right to life, and freedom from torture. Other issues, such as Kurdish rights, women's rights, LGBT rights, and press freedom, have also attracted controversy.

===Law===
{{Main|Judicial system of Turkey|Law enforcement in Turkey}}
[[File:Turkish Court of Cassation.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Turkish Court of Cassation in Ankara, originally established in Istanbul in 1868]]
[[Judicial system of Turkey|Turkey's judicial system]] has been wholly integrated with the [[Law in Europe|system of continental Europe]]. For instance, the [[Turkish civil code (1926)|Turkish Civil Code]] has been modified by incorporating elements mainly of the [[Swiss Civil Code]] and [[Swiss Code of Obligations|Code of Obligations]], and the [[Law of Germany|German Commercial Code]]. The Administrative Code bears similarities with its [[Law of France|French counterpart]], and the Penal Code with its [[Italian law codes|Italian counterpart]].&lt;ref name=mymerhaba.com&gt;{{cite web|title=Turkish Legal System|url=http://www.mymerhaba.com/Turkish-Legal-System-in-Turkey-213.html|website=mymerhaba.com/|access-date=14 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Turkey has adopted the principle of the separation of powers. In line with this principle, judicial power is exercised by independent courts on behalf of the Turkish nation. The independence and organisation of the courts, the security of the tenure of judges and public prosecutors, the profession of judges and prosecutors, the supervision of judges and public prosecutors, the military courts and their organisation, and the powers and duties of the high courts are regulated by the [[Turkish Constitution]].&lt;ref name=uhdigm.adalet.gov.tr&gt;{{cite web|title=THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM OF TURKEY|url=http://www.uhdigm.adalet.gov.tr/THE_JUDICIAL_SYSTEM_OF_TURKEY_AND_ORGANISATION_OF_THE_MINISTRY_OF_JUSTICE.pdf|website=uhdigm.adalet.gov.tr/|publisher=Ministry of Justice|access-date=14 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Article 142 of the Turkish Constitution, the organisation, duties and jurisdiction of the courts, their functions and the trial procedures are regulated by law. In line with the aforementioned article of the Turkish Constitution and related laws, the court system in Turkey can be classified under three main categories; which are the Judicial Courts, Administrative Courts and Military Courts. Each category includes first instance courts and high courts. In addition, the Court of Jurisdictional Disputes rules on cases that cannot be classified readily as falling within the purview of one court system.&lt;ref name=uhdigm.adalet.gov.tr /&gt;

Law enforcement in Turkey is carried out by several departments (such as the [[General Directorate of Security]] and [[Gendarmerie General Command]]) and agencies, all acting under the command of the Prime Minister of Turkey or mostly the [[Ministry of the Interior (Turkey)|Minister of Internal Affairs]]. According to figures released by the [[Ministry of Justice (Turkey)|Justice Ministry]], there are 100,000 people in [[Turkish prisons]] as of November 2008, a doubling since 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=General Directorate of Judicial Records|url=http://www.adlisicil.adalet.gov.tr/resmiistatistik.html#|website=adlisicil.adalet.gov|access-date=25 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the years of government by the AKP and Erdoğan, particularly since 2013, the independence and integrity of the Turkish judiciary has increasingly been considered in doubt by institutions, parliamentarians and journalists both within and outside of Turkey; due to political interference in the promotion of judges and prosecutors, and in their pursuit of public duty.&lt;ref name=EU2015&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ab.gov.tr/files/5%20Ekim/2015_turkey_report.pdf|title=European Commission: Turkey 2015 report|work=European Commission|date=10 November 2015|access-date=6 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=EP2016&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?pubRef=-//EP//NONSGML+TA+P8-TA-2016-0133+0+DOC+PDF+V0//EN|title=European Parliament resolution of 14 April 2016 on the 2015 report on Turkey|work=European Parliament|date=14 April 2016|access-date=6 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=TI2016&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.transparency.org/news/pressrelease/turkeys_institutions_are_failing_to_comply_with_good_governance_principles|title=Turkey’s institutions are failing to comply with good governance principles and combat corruption|work=Transparency International|date=7 April 2016|access-date=6 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://europe.newsweek.com/zaman-newspaper-turkey-free-speech-477859|title=As ISIS attacks mount, Turkey steps up its war on free speech|publisher=Newsweek|date=6 July 2016|access-date=6 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Turkey 2015 report'' of the [[European Commission]] stated that "the independence of the judiciary and respect of the principle of separation of powers have been undermined and judges and prosecutors have been under strong political pressure."&lt;ref name=EU2015 /&gt;

[[File:EU and Turkey Locator Map.png|thumb|After becoming [[Member states of the Council of Europe|one of the first members]] of the [[Council of Europe]] in 1949, Turkey became an [[Ankara Agreement|associate member]] of the [[European Economic Community|EEC]] in 1963, joined the [[European Union Customs Union|EU Customs Union]] in 1995 and started [[Accession of Turkey to the European Union|full membership negotiations]] with the [[European Union]] in 2005.&lt;ref name="TR_EUChrono" /&gt;]]

In line with its traditional Western orientation, relations with Europe have always been a central part of Turkish foreign policy. Turkey became [[Member states of the Council of Europe|one of the first members]] of the Council of Europe in 1949, applied for associate membership of the EEC (predecessor of the European Union) in 1959 and became an associate member in 1963.

As a general trend, the inland Anatolian plateau becomes increasingly rugged as it progresses eastward.&lt;ref name="TRGeo_TRMinistryTourism"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.turizm.net/turkey/info/geography.html|title=Geography of Turkey|publisher=Turkish Ministry of Tourism|access-date=13 December 2006|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Turkey's varied landscapes are the product of complex earth movements that have shaped the region over thousands of years and still manifest themselves in fairly frequent earthquakes and occasional [[volcano|volcanic]] eruptions. The Bosphorus and the Dardanelles owe their existence to the [[geologic fault|fault lines]] running through Turkey that led to the creation of the Black Sea. The [[North Anatolian Fault|North Anatolian Fault Line]] runs across the north of the country from west to east, along which major earthquakes took place in history. The latest of those big earthquakes was the [[1999 İzmit earthquake]].

Turkey's extraordinary [[ecosystem]] and habitat diversity has produced considerable species diversity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Biodiversity in Turkey|url=http://iucn.org/about/union/secretariat/offices/europe/?9778/Biodiversity-in-Turkey|access-date=9 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anatolia is the homeland of many plants that have been cultivated for food since the advent of [[agriculture]], and the wild ancestors of many plants that now provide staples for humankind still grow in Turkey. The diversity of Turkey's [[fauna]] is even greater than that of its [[flora]]. The number of animal species in the whole of [[Europe]] is around 60,000, while in Turkey there are over 80,000 (over 100,000 counting the subspecies).&lt;ref name=allaboutturkey&gt;{{cite web|title=Turkey's flora and fauna|url=http://www.allaboutturkey.com/turkfauna.htm|website=allaboutturkey.com|access-date=12 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Northern Anatolian conifer and deciduous forests]] is an [[ecoregion]] which covers most of the Pontic Mountains in northern Turkey, while the [[Caucasus mixed forests]] extend across the eastern end of the range. The region is home to [[Eurasia]]n wildlife such as the [[Eurasian sparrowhawk]], [[golden eagle]], [[eastern imperial eagle]], [[lesser spotted eagle]], [[Caucasian black grouse]], [[red-fronted serin]], and [[wallcreeper]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Couzens|first=Dominic|title=Top 100 Birding Sites of the World|publisher=[[University of California Press]]|year=2008|isbn=978-0-520-25932-4|pages=73–75}}&lt;/ref&gt; The narrow coastal strip between the Pontic Mountains and the Black Sea is home to the [[Euxine-Colchic deciduous forests]], which contain some of the world's few [[temperate rainforest]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.karalahana.com/english/rize-travel-highlands.htm |title=Pontic Mountains and highlands |access-date=9 August 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140226144110/http://www.karalahana.com/english/rize-travel-highlands.htm |archivedate=26 February 2014  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Turkish pine]] is mostly found in Turkey and other east Mediterranean countries.

The coastal areas bordering the Sea of Marmara, which connects the Aegean Sea and the Black Sea, have a transitional climate between a temperate Mediterranean climate and a temperate oceanic climate with warm to hot, moderately dry [[summer]]s and cool to cold, wet winters.&lt;ref name=Meteo /&gt; Snow falls on the coastal areas of the Sea of Marmara and the Black Sea almost every winter, but usually melts in no more than a few days.&lt;ref name=Meteo /&gt; However snow is rare in the coastal areas of the Aegean Sea and very rare in the coastal areas of the Mediterranean Sea.&lt;ref name=Meteo /&gt;

Mountains close to the coast prevent Mediterranean influences from extending inland, giving the central Anatolian [[plateau]] of the interior of Turkey a [[continental climate]] with sharply contrasting [[seasons]].&lt;ref name=Meteo /&gt;

Completed in 1892, the Ottoman Central Bank headquarters is seen at left. In 1995 the [[Borsa Istanbul|Istanbul Stock Exchange]] moved to [[İstinye]], while numerous Turkish banks moved their headquarters to the central business districts of [[Levent]] and [[Maslak]].]]

In the early decades of the Turkish Republic, the government (or banks established and owned by the government, such as [[Türkiye İş Bankası]] (1924), Sanayi ve Maadin Bankası (1925), Emlak ve Eytam Bankası (1926), [[Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey|Central Bank of Turkey]] (1930), [[Sümerbank]] (1933), [[İlbank|İller Bankası]] (1933), [[Etibank]] (1935), [[Denizbank]] (1937), [[Halk Bankası]] (1938), etc.) had to subsidise most of the industrial projects, due to the lack of a strong [[private sector]]. However, in the period between the 1920s and 1950s, a new generation of Turkish [[entrepreneur]]s such as [[Nuri Demirağ]], [[Vehbi Koç]], [[Hacı Ömer Sabancı]] and [[Nejat Eczacıbaşı]] began to establish privately owned factories, some of which evolved into the largest industrial [[conglomerate (company)|conglomerate]]s that dominate the Turkish economy today, such as [[Koç Holding]], [[Sabancı Holding]] and [[Eczacıbaşı|Eczacıbaşı Holding]].

During the first six decades of the republic, between 1923 and 1983, Turkey generally adhered to a quasi-[[statism|statist]] approach with strict government planning of the [[government budget|budget]] and government-imposed limitations over [[foreign trade]], flow of [[foreign exchange market|foreign currency]], foreign direct investment and private sector participation in certain fields (such as [[broadcasting]], [[telecommunications]], [[energy industry|energy]], [[mining]], etc.). However, in 1983, Prime Minister Turgut Özal initiated a series of reforms designed to shift the economy from a statist, insulated system to a more private-sector, [[market economy|market]]-based model.&lt;ref name="80sLiberalization"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Economics and Politics of Turkish Liberalization|first=Tevfik F.|last=Nas|publisher=Lehigh University Press|year=1992|isbn=978-0-934223-19-5|p=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The reforms, combined with unprecedented amounts of funding from foreign loans, spurred rapid economic growth; but this growth was punctuated by sharp [[recession]]s and financial crises in 1994, 1999 (following the earthquake in Izmit that year),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/422653.stm|title=Turkish quake hits shaky economy|publisher=BBC|access-date=12 December 2006|date=17 August 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 2001;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/1800869.stm|title='Worst over' for Turkey|publisher=BBC|access-date=12 December 2006|date=4 February 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; resulting in an average of 4 percent GDP growth per annum between 1981 and 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTTURKEY/Resources/361616-1144320150009/Labor_C2.pdf|title=Turkey Labor Market Study|work=World Bank|authorlink=World Bank|format=PDF|access-date=10 December 2006|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lack of additional fiscal reforms, combined with large and growing [[public sector]] [[Government budget deficit|deficits]] and widespread corruption, resulted in high inflation, a weak [[List of banks in Turkey|banking]] sector and increased [[macroeconomics|macroeconomic]] volatility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=OECD|title=Turkey 2002: Crucial Support for Economic Recovery|url={{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=Im0G8wNb-CsC |page=23 }}|access-date=15 June 2013|date=14 November 2002|publisher=OECD Publishing|isbn=978-92-64-17601-0|page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the [[Turkish Stock Market Crash of 2001|economic crisis of 2001]] and the reforms initiated by the finance minister of the time, [[Kemal Derviş]], inflation has dropped to single-digit figures for the first time in decades (8% in 2005), investor confidence and foreign investment have soared, and unemployment has fallen (10% in 2005).&lt;ref name="WorldBank_TRStat"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldbank.org.tr/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/COUNTRIES/ECAEXT/TURKEYEXTN/0,,menuPK:361738~pagePK:141132~piPK:141109~theSitePK:361712,00.html|title=Data and Statistics for Turkey|work=World Bank|authorlink=World Bank|access-date=10 December 2006|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- currency and inflation --&gt;
In the early years of the 21st century, the chronically high inflation was brought under control; this led to the launch of a new currency, the [[Turkish lira#8th Emission group|Turkish new lira]] (''Yeni Türk Lirası'') in 2005, to cement the acquisition of the economic reforms and erase the vestiges of an unstable economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/4137469.stm |title=Turkey knocks six zeros off lira|publisher=BBC|access-date=20 July 2008|date=31 December 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, after only four years in circulation, the ''Turkish new lira'' was renamed back to the [[Turkish lira]] with the introduction of [[Turkish lira#9th Emission group|new banknotes]] and [[Turkish Lira#Coins|coins]] (and the withdrawal of the ''Turkish new lira'' banknotes and coins that were introduced in 2005), but the [[ISO 4217]] code of the ''Turkish new lira'' (TRY) remains in use for the current ''Turkish lira'' in the foreign exchange market.

Water supply and sanitation in Turkey is characterised by achievements and challenges. Over the past decades access to drinking water has become almost universal and access to adequate sanitation has also increased substantially. Autonomous utilities have been created in the 16 [[Metropolitan municipalities in Turkey|metropolitan cities]] of Turkey and cost recovery has been increased, thus providing the basis for the sustainability of service provision. Intermittent supply, which was common in many cities, has become less frequent. In 2004, 61% of the wastewater collected through sewers was being treated. Remaining challenges include the need to further increase wastewater treatment, to reduce the high level of [[non-revenue water]] hovering around 50% and to expand access to adequate sanitation in rural areas. The investment required to comply with EU standards in the sector, especially in wastewater treatment, is estimated to be in the order of €2 billion per year, more than double the current level of investment.&lt;ref name="did-cevreorman17"&gt;Ministry of Environment and Forestry: [http://www.did-cevreorman.gov.tr/indir/UCES_ENG.pdf EU Integrated Environmental Approximation Strategy] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120312222212/http://www.did-cevreorman.gov.tr/indir/UCES_ENG.pdf |date=12 March 2012 }}, 2007, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[dissolution of the Ottoman Empire]] the number of Muslims in the region that became Turkey increased relative to the Christian population as Ottoman Muslims, who were facing extermination or other forms of repression in the newly constituted Balkan states, emigrated to the country. Not all were ethnic Turks; some were Albanian, Bosnian, Greek, Serbian, Macedonian and Bulgarian. Other Turks and Circassians fleeing Russian expansion in areas like the Caucasus and the Crimea also arrived during this period. By the 1920s, Islam had become the majority religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Taylor &amp; Francis| isbn = 978-0-415-36897-1| last = Gülalp| first = Haldun| title = Citizenship and Ethnic Conflict: Challenging the Nation-state| date = 2006| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aps1ruOW0_EC&amp;pg=PA62}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[List of Turkish painters|Turkish painting]], in the Western sense, developed actively starting from the mid 19th century.

Impressionism, among the contemporary trends, appeared later on with [[Halil Pasha (painter)|Halil Pasha]]. The young Turkish artists sent to Europe in 1926 came back inspired by contemporary trends such as Fauvism, Cubism and even Expressionism, still very influential in Europe.

Other important movements in Turkish painting were the "Yeniler Grubu" (The Newcomers Group) of the late 1930s; the "On'lar Grubu" (Group of Ten) of the 1940s; the "Yeni Dal Grubu" (New Branch Group) of the 1950s; and the "Siyah Kalem Grubu" (Black Pen Group) of the 1960s.&lt;ref name=turkresmi.com&gt;{{cite web|title="10’LAR’ GRUBU", "YENİ DAL GRUBU", "SİYAH KALEM GRUBU"|url=http://www.turkresmi.com/klasorler/10lar_yenidal_siyahkalem/index.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060908221749/http://www.turkresmi.com/klasorler/10lar_yenidal_siyahkalem/index.htm|dead-url=yes|archive-date=8 September 2006|website=turkresmi.com|access-date=11 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Turkish carpet|Carpet weaving]] represents a traditional art, dating back to pre-Islamic times. During its long history, the art and craft of the woven carpet has integrated different cultural traditions. Traces of Byzantine design can be detected, [[Turkic peoples]] migrating from Central Asia, as well as Armenian people, Caucasian and Kurdic tribes either living in, or migrating to Anatolia, brought with them their traditional designs. The arrival of Islam and the development of the [[Islamic art]] also influenced Turkish carpet design. The history of its designs, motifs and ornaments thus reflects the political and ethnic history and diversity of the area of Asia minor. However, scientific attempts were unsuccessful, as yet, to attribute a particular design to a specific ethnic, regional, or even nomadic versus village tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Brueggemann |first1=Werner |last2=Boehmer |first2=Harald |title=Teppiche der Bauern und Nomaden in Anatolien = Carpets of the Peasants and Nomads in Anatolia |date=1982 |publisher=Verlag Kunst und Antiquitäten |location=Munich|isbn=3-921 811-20-1 |pages=34–39 |edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Turkish miniature]] is an art form, which can be linked to the Persian miniature tradition, as well as strong Chinese artistic influences. The words taswir or nakish were used to define the art of miniature painting in Ottoman Turkish. The studios the artists worked in were called Nakkashanes.&lt;ref name="miniature1"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barry|first1=Michael|title=Figurative art in medieval Islam and the riddle of Bihzâd of Herât (1465–1535)|isbn=978-2080304216|pages=27|url=https://books.google.com/?id=vBIVAQAAIAAJ|access-date=11 February 2017|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; The miniatures were usually not signed, perhaps because of the rejection of individualism, but also because the works were not created entirely by one person; the head painter designed the composition of the scene, and his apprentices drew the contours (which were called tahrir) with black or colored ink and then painted the miniature without creating an illusion of third dimension. The head painter, and much more often the scribe of the text, were indeed named and depicted in some of the manuscripts. The understanding of perspective was different from that of the nearby European Renaissance painting tradition, and the scene depicted often included different time periods and spaces in one picture. They followed closely the context of the book they were included in, resembling more illustrations rather than standalone works of art.&lt;ref name="turkishculture.org2"&gt;{{cite web|title=TURKISH MINIATURES|url=http://www.turkishculture.org/traditional-arts/miniatures-563.htm|website=www.turkishculture.org|access-date=11 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest examples of [[Turkish paper marbling]] are thought to be a copy of the Hâlnâme by the poet Arifî. The text of this manuscript was rendered in a delicate cut paper découpage calligraphy by Mehmed bin Gazanfer and completed in 1540, and features many marbled and decorative paper borders. One early master by the name of Şebek is mentioned posthumously in the earliest Ottoman text on the art known as the Tertib-i Risâle-i Ebrî, which is dated based on internal evidence to after 1615. Several recipes in the text are accredited to this master. Another famous 18th-century master by the name of Hatip Mehmed Efendi (died 1773) is accredited with developing motifs and perhaps early floral designs, although evidence from India appears to contradict some of these claims. Despite this, marbled motifs are commonly referred to as "Hatip" designs in Turkey today.&lt;ref name="turkishculture.org3"&gt;{{cite web|title=THE TURKISH ART OF MARBLING (EBRU)|url=http://www.turkishculture.org/traditional-arts/marbling-113.htm|website=turkishculture.org|access-date=11 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Turkish literature]] is a mix of cultural influences. Interaction between the Ottoman Empire and the Islamic world along with Europe contributed to a blend of Turkic, Islamic and European traditions in modern-day Turkish music and literary arts.&lt;ref name=ottomus&gt;{{cite web|title=OTTOMAN MUSIC|url=http://www.turkishculture.org/music/classical/ottoman-music-474.htm?type=1|website=turkishculture.org|access-date=18 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Turkish literature]] was heavily influenced by [[Persian literature|Persian]] and [[Arabic literature]] during most of the Ottoman era. The [[Tanzimat]] reforms introduced previously unknown Western genres, primarily the novel and the short story. Many of the writers in the Tanzimat period wrote in several genres simultaneously: for instance, the poet [[Namik Kemal|Nâmık Kemal]] also wrote the important 1876 novel ''İntibâh'' (Awakening), while the journalist [[İbrahim Şinasi|Şinasi]] is noted for writing, in 1860, the first modern Turkish play, the [[One act play|one-act]] comedy "''Şair Evlenmesi''" (The Poet's Marriage). Most of the roots of modern Turkish literature were formed between the years 1896 and 1923. Broadly, there were three primary literary movements during this period: the ''Edebiyat-ı Cedîde'' (New Literature) movement; the ''Fecr-i Âtî'' (Dawn of the Future) movement; and the ''Millî Edebiyat'' (National Literature) movement. The first radical step of innovation in 20th century Turkish poetry was taken by [[Nâzım Hikmet Ran|Nâzım Hikmet]], who introduced the [[free verse]] style. Another revolution in Turkish poetry came about in 1941 with the [[Garip]] movement led by [[Orhan Veli Kanık|Orhan Veli]], [[Oktay Rıfat Horozcu|Oktay Rıfat]] and [[Melih Cevdet Anday|Melih Cevdet]]. The mix of cultural influences in Turkey is dramatised, for example, in the form of the "new symbols of the clash and interlacing of cultures" enacted in the novels of [[Orhan Pamuk]], recipient of the 2006 [[Nobel Prize in Literature]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/6044192.stm|title=Pamuk wins Nobel Literature prize|publisher=BBC|access-date=12 December 2006|date=12 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The origin of [[Turkish theatre]] dates back thousands of years to ancient pagan rituals. The dances, music and songs performed during the rituals of the inhabitants of Anatolia millennia ago are the elements from which the first shows originated. These rituals later became theatrical shows. In the 10th century, a blend of traditions occurred between the Seljuk Turks and those of the inhabitants of Anatolia. The interaction between the various tribal societies paved the way for new plays. 

After the [[Tanzimat]] (Reformation) period in the 19th century, characters in Turkish theatre were modernized and plays were performed on European-style stages with the actors wearing European costumes. Following the [[Second Constitutional Era|restoration of constitutional monarchy]] with the [[Young Turk Revolution]] in 1908, theatrical activities increased and social problems began to be reflected in the theatre as well as in historical plays. A theatrical conservatoire, Darülbedayi-i Osmani, was established in Istanbul in 1914. During the years of chaos and war, the Darülbedayi-i Osmani continued its activities and attracted the younger generation. Turkish playwrights emerged. Some wrote on romantic subjects, others were interested in social problems and still others dealt with nationalistic themes. There were even those who wrote musicals. In time, Turkish women began to appear on stage and this was indeed a revolution of the time, since female roles had only been played by actresses who were members of Turkey’s ethnic minorities. Today, theatre acts are performed by numerous private theatre companies and subsidized companies such as the [[Turkish State Theatres]].&lt;ref name="turkishculture.org4"&gt;{{cite web|title=TRADITIONAL THEATRE|url=http://www.turkishculture.org/performing-arts/theatre-36.htm|website=turkishculture.org|access-date=11 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Music of Turkey]] includes mainly [[Turkic culture|Turkic]] elements as well as partial influences ranging from [[Music of Central Asia|Central Asian folk music]], [[Arabic music]], [[Greek music]], [[Ottoman music]], [[Persian traditional music|Persian music]] and [[Music of Southeastern Europe|Balkan music]], as well as references to more modern European and [[Music of the United States|American]] [[popular music]]. The roots of traditional music in Turkey span across centuries to a time when the [[Seljuk Turks]] migrated to [[Anatolia]] and [[Persia]] in the 11th century and contains elements of both Turkic and pre-Turkic influences. Much of its modern popular music can trace its roots to the emergence in the early 1930s drive for [[Westernization]].&lt;ref name="soundsofanatolia"&gt;{{cite book|author=Stokes, Martin|title=Sounds of Anatolia|publisher=Penguin Books|year=2000|isbn=978-1-85828-636-5}}, pp 396–410.&lt;/ref&gt;

With the assimilation of immigrants from various regions the diversity of musical genres and musical instrumentation also expanded. Turkey has also seen documented folk music and recorded popular music produced in the ethnic styles of [[Music of Greece|Greek]], [[Music of Armenia|Armenian]], [[Music of Albania|Albanian]], [[Music of Poland|Polish]] and [[Jewish]] communities, among others.&lt;ref name="lesartsturcs"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lesartsturcs.com/|title=History of music in Turkey|work=Les Arts Turcs |date=1 May 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many Turkish cities and towns have vibrant local music scenes which, in turn, support a number of regional musical styles. Despite this however, western-style music styles like [[pop music]] and [[Kanto (music)|kanto]] lost popularity to [[arabesque]] in the late 70s and 80s. It became popular again by the beginning of the 1990s, as a result of an opening economy and society. With the support of [[Sezen Aksu]], the resurging popularity of pop music gave rise to several international Turkish pop stars such as [[Tarkan (singer)|Tarkan]] and [[Sertab Erener]]. The late 1990s also saw an emergence of underground music producing alternative [[Turkish rock music|Turkish rock]], [[electronica]], [[Turkish hip hop|hip-hop]], [[Hip hop music|rap]] and [[dance music]] in opposition to the mainstream corporate [[pop music|pop]] and [[Arabesque music|arabesque]] genres, which many believe have become too commercial.&lt;ref name="musicscene"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tarkandeluxe.blogspot.com/2006/02/istanbul-music-scene.html|title=Istanbul Music Scene|work=Yildirim, Ali.

The [[Seljuk architecture|architecture of the Seljuk Turks]] combined the elements and characteristics of the [[Architecture of Central Asia|Turkic architecture of Central Asia]] with those of [[Persian architecture|Persian]], [[Arab architecture|Arab]], [[Armenian architecture|Armenian]] and [[Byzantine architecture|Byzantine]] architecture. The transition from Seljuk architecture to [[Ottoman architecture]] is most visible in [[Bursa]], which was the capital of the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman State]] between 1335 and 1413. Following the [[Fall of Constantinople|Ottoman conquest of Constantinople (Istanbul)]] in 1453, Ottoman architecture was significantly influenced by [[Byzantine architecture]]. [[Topkapı Palace]] in Istanbul is one of the most famous examples of classical Ottoman architecture and was the primary residence of the [[Ottoman Sultan]]s for approximately 400 years.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/08/22/travel/center-of-ottoman-power.html|title=Center of Ottoman Power|work=New York Times|last=Simons|first=Marlise|access-date=4 June 2009|date=22 August 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mimar Sinan]] (c.1489–1588) was the most important architect of the classical period in Ottoman architecture. He was the chief architect of at least 374 buildings which were constructed in various [[eyalet|provinces]] of the [[Ottoman Empire]] in the 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cadde.milliyet.com.tr/2013/12/30/HaberDetay/1656832/iSTANBUL_A_iMZASINI_ATTI|title=A list of the buildings designed by Mimar Sinan|access-date=9 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the 18th century, Turkish architecture has been increasingly influenced by European styles, and this can be particularly seen in the [[Tanzimat]] era buildings of Istanbul like the [[Dolmabahçe Palace|Dolmabahçe]], [[Çırağan Palace|Çırağan]], [[Feriye Sarayları|Feriye]], [[Beylerbeyi Palace|Beylerbeyi]], [[Küçüksu Palace|Küçüksu]], [[Ihlamur Palace|Ihlamur]] and [[Yıldız Palace|Yıldız]] [[palace]]s, which were all designed by members of the [[Balyan family]] of Ottoman court architects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A History of Ottoman Architecture|first=Godfrey|last=Goodwin|publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson|year=2003|isbn=978-0-500-27429-3|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ottoman era [[yalı|waterfront houses (''yalı'')]] on the [[Bosphorus]] also reflect the fusion between classical Ottoman and European architectural styles during the aforementioned period. The [[First National Architectural Movement]] (''Birinci Ulusal Mimarlık Akımı'') in the early 20th century sought to create a new architecture, which was based on motifs from Seljuk and Ottoman architecture. The movement was also labelled ''Turkish Neoclassical'' or the ''National Architectural Renaissance''.&lt;ref name="First"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.archmuseum.org/Gallery/Photo_6_1_the-search-for-identity-1st-national-architecture-movement.html |title=The Search for Identity: 1st National Architecture Movement |publisher=ArchMuseum.org |access-date=20 January 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110913161900/http://www.archmuseum.org/Gallery/Photo_6_1_the-search-for-identity-1st-national-architecture-movement.html |archivedate=13 September 2011  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The leading architects of this movement were [[Vedat Tek]] (1873–1942), [[Mimar Kemaleddin Bey]] (1870–1927), [[Arif Hikmet Koyunoğlu]] (1888–1982) and Giulio Mongeri (1873–1953).&lt;ref name=turkisharch&gt;{{cite web|title=TURKISH ARCHITECTURE IN THE REPUBLICAN PERIOD |url=http://www.archmuseum.org/Gallery/turkish-architecture-in-the-republican-period_6.html |website=archmuseum.org |access-date=18 February 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150318163506/http://www.archmuseum.org/Gallery/turkish-architecture-in-the-republican-period_6.html |archivedate=18 March 2015  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Notable buildings from this era are the [[Istanbul Main Post Office|Grand Post Office]] in Istanbul (1905–1909), [[Tayyare Apartments]] (1919–1922),&lt;ref name="tayyare"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atelyemim.com/mimari/ramada_eng.html|title=Tayyare Apartment Building|publisher =AtelyeMim.com|access-date=2 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Istanbul 4th Vakıf Han]] (1911–1926),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.academia.edu/7839332|publisher=Yıldız Teknik Üniversitesi-Fen Bilimleri Enstitüsü|title=XIX.

Turkish cuisine is largely the heritage of [[Ottoman cuisine]]. In the early years of the Republic, a few studies were published about regional Anatolian dishes but cuisine did not feature heavily in Turkish folkloric studies until the 1980s, when the fledgling tourism industry encouraged the Turkish state to sponsor two food symposia. The papers submitted at the symposia presented the history of Turkish cuisine on a "historical continuum" that dated back to Turkic origins in Central Asia and continued through the Seljuk and Ottoman periods.&lt;ref name=berg&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Berg| isbn = 978-0-85785-217-5| last1 = Claflin| first1 = Kyri W.| last2 = Scholliers| first2 = Peter| title = Writing Food History: A Global Perspective| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7WUDAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA1980 |date = 1 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Many of the papers presented at these first two symposia were unreferenced. Prior to the symposia, the study of Turkish culinary culture was first popularized by the publication of Süheyl Ünver's ''Fifty Dishes in Turkish History'' in 1948. This book was based on recipes found in an 18th century Ottoman manuscript. His second book was about palace cuisine during the reign of [[Mehmet II]]. Following the publication of Ünver's book subsequent studies were published, including a 1978 study by a historian named Bahaettin Ögel about the [[Central Asian cuisine|Central Asian]] origins of Turkish cuisine.&lt;ref name=berg /&gt;

Ottoman cuisine was influenced by [[Balkan cuisine|Balkan]], [[Arab cuisine|Arab]], [[Byzantine cuisine|Byzantine]], [[Kurdish cuisine|Kurdish]], [[Persian cuisine|Persian]] and [[Armenian cuisine]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = ABC-CLIO| isbn = 978-1-61069-389-9| last = Kia| first = Mehrdad| title = The Ottoman Empire: A Historical Encyclopedia [2 volumes]| date = 15 June 2017|ref=https://books.google.com/books?id=UgUmDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The country's position between the East and the [[Mediterranean Sea]] helped the Turks gain complete control of major trade routes, and an ideal environment allowed plants and animals to flourish. Turkish cuisine was well established by the mid-1400s, the beginning of the [[Ottoman Empire]]'s six hundred-year reign. [[Yogurt]] salads, fish in [[olive oil]], [[sharbat|sherbet]] and [[dolma|stuffed and wrapped vegetables]] became Turkish staples. The empire, eventually spanning from Austria to [[northern Africa]], used its land and water routes to import exotic ingredients from all over the world. By the end of the 16th century, the Ottoman court housed over 1,400 live-in cooks and passed laws regulating the freshness of food. Since the fall of the empire in World War I (1914–1918) and the establishment of the Turkish Republic in 1923, foreign food such as French hollandaise sauce and western fast food have made their way into the modern Turkish diet.&lt;ref name="foodbycountry.com"&gt;{{cite web|title=Food in Turkey – Turkish Food, Turkish Cuisine |url=http://www.foodbycountry.com/Spain-to-Zimbabwe-Cumulative-Index/Turkey.html|website=foodbycountry.com|access-date=12 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
{{Main article|List of Zatch Bell! characters}}
One hundred Demons go to Earth every 1,000 years to battle to be the king of the Demon world. Each Demon needs a human partner in order to use his or her spell book, a book that seals the powers of the Demons. When read aloud, the spells are cast by the Demon producing many effects. If the spell book is burned, the Demon is forced to return to the Demon world, and they lose all claim to the position of the Demon king. While the spells in each book typically are different for each Demon, there are Demon that share spells, like Zatch Bell and his evil twin brother, Zeno Bell. The human and their Demon gain these spells through experience and hard work. The last Demon standing without their book burnt is the new Demon king.

The story follows [[Kiyo Takamine and Zatch Bell|Kiyo Takamine]], a 14-year-old boy in junior high school. His father, Seitaro Takamine, discovers an unconscious child named [[Kiyo Takamine and Zatch Bell|Zatch Bell]] while in a forest in England, and sends Zatch to live with Kiyo. Unlike the other Mamodo, Zatch lost his memory of the Mamodo world. Kiyo learns about the spell book when he reads a spell causing Zatch to fire lightning from his mouth (the spell is mentioned in the first episode). As Kiyo and Zatch begin to encounter different Mamodos and learn more about the Mamodo battles, they discover that there are those who do not wish to fight and there are those who fight for the wrong reasons. After meeting a Mamodo named [[List of Zatch Bell! characters#Lori and Kolulu|Kolulu]] and seeing how this kind Mamodo was forced to fight due to the power of her spells, Zatch decides to become a kind king in order to stop the battle from ever happening again. As the story progresses, Zatch and Kiyo meet other Mamodos that share similar views to them and become allies. They meet allies such as [[List of Zatch Bell! characters#Megumi Oumi and Tia|Megumi Oumi and Tia]] in which they specialize in defensive spells such as different types of shields. Kiyo and Zatch meet [[List of Zatch Bell! characters#Parco Folgore and Kanchomé|Folgore and Kanchomé (Canchome)]] who are both comic relief characters and they only have transformation spells such as Kanchomé being able to turn himself really big. Zatch met [[List of Zatch Bell! characters#Kafk Sunbeam and Umagon|Kafk Sunbeam and Umagon]] earlier in England. Umagon is a Mamodo who specializes in transformation spells that can put armor around his body. [[List of Zatch Bell! characters#Sherry Belmont and Brago|Shery (Sherie) Belmont and Brago]] who was originally Zatch and Kiyo's rival in the series later becomes their allies and he has gravity type spells.

As the number of Mamodos decreases, Zatch and his allies encounter a Mamodo called [[List of Zatch Bell! characters#Koko and Zofis|Zofis]] who takes control of several Mamodos who were sealed in stone from the previous battle to decide the king. With Kiyo and Zatch needing more allies, they meet [[List of Zatch Bell! characters#Dr.Riddles and Kido|Dr. Riddles and Kido]]. They helped teach the main allies how to unlock new spells such as Zatch unlocking the sixth spell. Kiyo and Zatch with friends make their way to South America to fight off Zofis and the thousand year Mamodos. Many characters fell and got their book burned. The most notable one was Kido who was sent back to the Mamodo world after fighting Belgium E.O. Ultimately, Sherry and Brago came to help to fight Zofis. Zofis took control of Sherry's friend Koko who Zofis makes her do evil things such as burning a whole town. Sherry and Brago beat Zofis but not without the help of Kiyo and friends. Sherry gets Koko back to normal and the battle in South America is over.  After the battle against Zofis, the whole world is put in danger after a giant Mamodo named [[List of Zatch Bell! characters#Faudo|Faudo]] is brought to life by a Mamodo named Riou. Riou was looking for Mamodos that have enough strength to help activate Faudo. So he puts a curse on [[List of Zatch Bell! characters#Li-en and Wonrei|Li-en and Wonrei]] who Kiyo and Zatch befriend in the middle of the series. The protagonists make their way to Faudo to try to destroy it and to save their friends. The battle in Faudo was the toughest battle for the characters up to that point in the story. Kiyo almost died against Riou, and many of Zatch's friends got sent back to the Mamodo world such as Wonrei. Faudo is then taken over by a Mamodo that looks like Zatch, who turns out to be Zatch's twin brother [[List of Zatch Bell! characters#Dufort and Zeno Bell|Zeno Bell]]. Zatch and Zeno have a big fight inside of Faudo. Through Zeno's flashback, he resented Zatch because their Father King Bell bestowed Zatch the power of Bao, which is Zatch's strongest spell. Zeno at a young age had to train everyday and always got punished while Zatch lived with another family peacefully. Ultimately, Zeno understands Zatch also suffered too and apologizes to what he has done to Zatch. Zeno gets his book burned and is sent back to the Mamodo world.

Finally, when the number of Mamodos have decreased to ten, an evil and powerful Mamodo named [[List of Zatch Bell! characters#Vino and Clear Note|Clear Note]] appears. With Clear Note's immense strength the protagonists have to train to fight against Clear Note in the King's Festival. The King's Festival is where the final ten Mamodo have to fight to be king. Most notably before the Zatch and Kiyo fought Clear Note, Kanchome got sent back to the Mamodo world when he was ambushed by Clear Note. With Kancome gone before the big fight it Kiyo, Megumi, and Sunbeam vowed to win against Clear Note for Kanchome and Folgore's sake. Past Mamodos who Kiyo and Zatch have encountered in the past came to help out. They helped out in a form of spells because Kiyo's spell book unlocked all of the Mamodo's spells. Kiyo used Kido's strongest spell, Wonrei's strongest spell, and many more spells from their past allies  After many sacrifices, Clear Note is defeated leaving Zatch and his ally [[List of Zatch Bell! characters#Sherry Belmont and Brago|Brago]] as the remaining Mamodos. After Kiyo's graduation ceremony, Zatch and Brago battle and Zatch is crowned the Mamodo King. For the prize for helping Zatch become king. Kiyo had an option of two prizes: either getting a wish and forgetting about Zatch, or get nothing but keep his memories of Zatch. He chooses the latter option.  Three weeks later, a letter is sent from the Mamodos to their human partners. Zatch's letter reveals that all is well in the Mamodo world.

After Raiku's series in the ''[[Shōnen Sunday Super]]'' ended, Raiku looked at his old drafts he created in the past for an idea for his next series.&lt;ref name="Vol 1"&gt;{{cite book|last=Raiku|first=Makoto|script-title=ja:金色のガッシュ!!|publisher=[[Shogakukan]]|date=May 18, 2001|series=[[Zatch Bell]]|volume=Volume 1|isbn=978-4-09-126231-8|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of his ideas was a mercenary who uses a giant sword to defeat enemies. After playing with that idea for three months, Raiku decided to abandon it and go with another idea.&lt;ref name="Vol 1"/&gt; His next idea was a story where a middle school student finds an old toy and with the help of a noble knight, combats evil and after taking this up with his agent, he was advised to use a cuter character to fight and thus, [[Kiyo Takamine and Zatch Bell|Zatch]] was created.&lt;ref name="Vol 1"/&gt; After Raiku worked on the idea for a few months, it was published.&lt;ref name="Vol 1"/&gt; Raiku said that he intended to create a "passionate story about a heartwarming friendship" and that he used the concept as a "base" while adding the mamodo, book, and spell concepts. He was inspired by a western magic story that he read to create Zatch's red spell book. The reason Zatch uses lightning spells because his name had the word "Raiku" means "lightning" in Japanese. He mentions he created [[List of Zatch Bell! characters#Parco Folgore and Kanchomé|Folgore]] with the words "Invincible Italian Man" as a base.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zatch-bell.com/index3_skip.html|title=Origins, Creator Q &amp; A|publisher=Viz Media|accessdate=August 19, 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100129035235/http://www.zatch-bell.com/index3_skip.html|archivedate=January 29, 2010|deadurl=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
