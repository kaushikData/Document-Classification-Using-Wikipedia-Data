[[File:AbuGhraibAbuse-standing-on-box.jpg|thumb|This image of a prisoner, [[Ali Shallal al-Qaisi]], being tortured has become internationally famous, eventually making it onto the cover of ''[[The Economist]]'' (see "[[#Media coverage|Media coverage]]" below)]]

During the [[Iraq War|war in Iraq]] that began in March 2003, personnel of the [[United States Army]] and the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] committed a series of [[human rights violations]] against detainees in the [[Abu Ghraib prison]] in Iraq.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Greenwald |first=Glenn |url=http://www.salon.com/news/abu_ghraib/2006/03/14/chapter_5/index.html |title=Other government agencies |publisher=Salon.com |accessdate=April 3, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080212035108/http://www.salon.com/news/abu_ghraib/2006/03/14/chapter_5/index.html |archivedate=February 12, 2008 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; These violations included [[Physical abuse|physical]] and [[sexual abuse]], [[torture]], [[rape]], [[sodomy]], and [[murder]].&lt;ref name='New Yorker 2004-05-17'&gt;{{cite news | first = Seymour M. | last = Hersh | title = Chain of Command | date = May 17, 2004 | url = http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2004/05/17/040517fa_fact2?currentPage=all | work = The New Yorker | accessdate = September 13, 2011 | quote = NBC News later quoted U.S. military officials as saying that the unreleased photographs showed American soldiers "severely beating an Iraqi prisoner nearly to death, having sex with a female Iraqi prisoner, and 'acting inappropriately with a dead body.'

The [[Presidency of George W. Bush|administration of George W. Bush]] asserted that these were isolated incidents, not indicative of general U.S. policy.&lt;ref name="Brown 2005"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brown|first1=Michelle|title="Setting the Conditions" for Abu Ghraib: The Prison Nation Abroad|journal=American Quarterly|date=September 2005|volume=57|issue=3|pages=973–997|jstor=40068323}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Smeulers"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Smeulers|first1=Alette|last2=van Niekirk|first2=Sander|title=Abu Ghraib and the War on Terror-A case against Donald Rumsfeld?|journal=Crime Law Social Change|date=2009|volume=51|pages=327–349}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was disputed by humanitarian organizations such as the [[International Committee of the Red Cross|Red Cross]], [[Amnesty International]], and [[Human Rights Watch]]. These organizations stated that the abuses at Abu Ghraib were not isolated incidents, but were part of a wider pattern of torture and brutal treatment at American overseas detention centers, including those in [[Iraq]], [[Afghanistan]], and [[Guantanamo Bay Naval Base|Guantanamo Bay]].&lt;ref name="Smeulers"/&gt; Several scholars stated that the abuses constituted state-sanctioned crimes.&lt;ref name="Brown 2005"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Smeulers"/&gt;

The United States Department of Defense removed seventeen soldiers and officers from duty, and eleven soldiers were charged with [[dereliction of duty]], maltreatment, [[aggravated assault]] and [[Battery (crime)|battery]]. Between May 2004, and March 2006, these soldiers were convicted in [[courts-martial]], sentenced to military prison, and [[dishonorable discharge|dishonorably discharged]] from service. Two soldiers, Specialist [[Charles Graner]] and PFC [[Lynndie England]], were sentenced to ten and three years in prison, respectively. [[Brigadier General]] [[Janis Karpinski]], the commanding officer of all detention facilities in Iraq, was reprimanded and demoted to the rank of [[Colonel (United States)|colonel]]. Several more military personnel who were accused of perpetrating or authorizing the measures, including many of higher rank, were not prosecuted. It was reported that most inmates were innocent of the crimes they were accused of and were simply detained due to their being in the wrong place at the wrong time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sz-magazin.sueddeutsche.de/texte/anzeigen/41786/1/1|title=Spuren der Gewalt|website=sueddeutsche.de|language=German|access-date=2017-07-01|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171205042032/http://sz-magazin.sueddeutsche.de/texte/anzeigen/41786/1/1|archivedate=December 5, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Documents popularly known as the [[Torture Memos]] came to light a few years later. These documents, prepared shortly before the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]] by the [[United States Department of Justice]], authorized certain [[enhanced interrogation techniques]], generally held to involve torture of foreign detainees. The memoranda also argued that [[International law|international humanitarian laws]], such as the [[Geneva Conventions]], did not apply to American interrogators overseas. Several subsequent U.S. Supreme Court decisions, including ''[[Hamdan v. Rumsfeld]]'' (2006), have overturned Bush administration policy, and ruled that [[Geneva Conventions]] apply.

Many of the torture techniques used were developed at Guantánamo detention center, including prolonged isolation; the [[Frequent_flyer_program_(Guantanamo)|frequent flier program]], a sleep deprivation program whereby people were moved from cell to cell every few hours so they couldn't sleep for days, weeks, even months, short-shackling in painful positions; nudity; extreme use of heat and cold; the use of loud music and noise and preying on phobias.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://wikileaksdecrypted.com/guantanamo-torture-columbia-university/|title=Investigative Reporter Andy Worthington on Guantanamo Torture|website=wikileaksdecrypted.com|language=en-GB|access-date=2016-12-02|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220030351/http://wikileaksdecrypted.com/guantanamo-torture-columbia-university/|archivedate=December 20, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rs?|date=January 2018}}

==Background==

===War on terror===
The [[September 11 attacks]] in the United States led to demands from the public that U.S. president George W. Bush take actions that would prevent further attacks.&lt;ref name="Smeulers"/&gt; This pressure led to the launch of the [[War on Terror]].&lt;ref name="Smeulers"/&gt;{{Better source needed|date=August 2018}} The fact that the perceived enemies in the War on Terror were stateless individuals, and the perceived threat of extreme strategies including [[suicide bombing]], led to a pressure on the Bush administration to act decisively.&lt;ref name="Smeulers"/&gt; In addition, these tactics created the perception that the "legitimate" techniques used in the cold war would not be of much use. US vice-president [[Dick Cheney]] stated, for example, that the US "[had] to work sort of on the dark side",&lt;ref name="Smeulers"/&gt; and that it had to "use any means at [its] disposal".&lt;ref name="Smeulers"/&gt;

===Iraq War===
{{Main article|Iraq War}}

The [[Iraq War]] began in March 2003 as an invasion of [[Ba'athist Iraq]] by a force led by the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/3661134.stm|title=Iraq war illegal, says Annan|publisher=|accessdate=September 16, 2014|work=BBC News|date=September 16, 2004|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140912171408/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/3661134.stm|archivedate=September 12, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PBS-20040226"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/invasion/cron/ |title=A chronology of the six-week invasion of Iraq |date=February 26, 2004 |publisher=[[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] |accessdate=March 19, 2008 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080331235432/http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/invasion/cron/ |archivedate=March 31, 2008 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ba'athist government led by [[Saddam Hussein]] was toppled within a month. This conflict was followed by a longer phase of fighting in which an insurgency emerged to oppose [[Multi-National Force&amp;nbsp;– Iraq|the occupying forces]] and the post-invasion Iraqi government.&lt;ref name=Britannica&gt;{{cite web|title=Iraq War|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/870845/Iraq-War|work=Britannica|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=October 27, 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121016074755/http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/870845/Iraq-War|archivedate=October 16, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this insurgency, the United States was in the role of an [[Military occupation|occupying power]].&lt;ref name=Britannica/&gt;

===Abu Ghraib prison===
{{Further information|Abu Ghraib prison}}
The [[Abu Ghraib prison]] in the town of [[Abu Ghraib]] was one of the most notorious prisons in Iraq during the government of Saddam Hussein. The prison was used to hold approximately 50,000 men and women in poor conditions, and torture and execution were frequent.&lt;ref name="Hersh 2004"/&gt; The prison was located on 280 acres of land 32 kilometers west of [[Baghdad]].&lt;ref name="Fast facts"&gt;{{cite web|author=CNN Library|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2013/10/30/world/meast/iraq-prison-abuse-scandal-fast-facts/|title=Iraq Prison Abuse Scandal Fast Facts|publisher=[[CNN]]|date=2016-03-12|accessdate=2016-09-17|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160905090342/http://edition.cnn.com/2013/10/30/world/meast/iraq-prison-abuse-scandal-fast-facts/|archivedate=September 5, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the collapse of Saddam Hussein's government, the prison was looted and everything that was removable was carried away. Following the invasion, the U.S. army refurbished it and turned it into a military prison.&lt;ref name="Hersh 2004"/&gt; It was the largest of several detention centers in Iraq used by the U.S. military.&lt;ref name="ASIL 2004"/&gt; In March 2004, during the time that the U.S. military was using the Abu Ghraib prison as a detention facility, it housed approximately 7,490 prisoners.&lt;ref name="Google Books"&gt;{{cite book|last=General (Dept. of the Army)|first=Inspector|title=Detainee Operations Inspection|year=2004|publisher=DIANE Publishing|isbn=1-4289-1031-X|pages=23–24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three categories of prisoners were imprisoned at Abu Ghraib by the U.S. military. These were "common criminals," individuals suspected of being leaders of the insurgency, and individuals suspected of committing crimes against the occupational force led by the U.S.{{sfn|Hersh|2004|pp=20-21}} Although most prisoners lived in tents in the yard, the abuses took place inside cell blocks 1a and 1b.&lt;ref name="Fast facts"/&gt; The [[800th Military Police Brigade]], from [[Uniondale, New York|Uniondale]], New York, was responsible for running the prison.&lt;ref name="ASIL 2004"/&gt; The brigade was commanded by Brigadier General [[Janis Karpinski]], who was in charge of all of the U.S. run prisons in Iraq. She did not have previous experience in running a prison.{{sfn|Hersh|2004|pp=20-21}} The individuals who committed abuses at the prison were members of the [[372nd Military Police Company]], which was a constituent of the [[320th Military Police Battalion]], which was overseen by Karpinski's Brigade headquarters.{{sfn|Hersh|2004|p=22}}

The [[Fay Report]] noted that "contracting-related issues contributed to the problems at Abu Ghraib prison". Over half the interrogators working at the prison were employees of [[CACI International]], while [[Titan Corporation]] supplied linguistics personnel. In his report, General Fay notes that "The general policy of not contracting for intelligence functions and services was designed in part to avoid many of the problems that eventually developed at Abu Ghraib..."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| volume = 16| pages = 25| last = Schooner| first = Steven L| title = Contractor Atrocities at Abu Ghraib: Compromised Accountability in a Streamlined, Outsourced Government| journal = Policy Review| url=https://scholarship.law.gwu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1102&amp;context=faculty_publications |date = 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2003, [[Amnesty International]] published reports of human rights abuse by the [[U.S. military]] and its coalition partners at detention centers and prisons in Iraq.&lt;ref name="AI 2003"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.amnesty.org/download/Documents/108000/mde141362003en.pdf |title=Iraq: Human rights must be foundation for rebuilding |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=June 20, 2003 |publisher=Amnesty International |accessdate=February 6, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160207002301/https://www.amnesty.org/download/Documents/108000/mde141362003en.pdf |archivedate=February 7, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; These included reports of brutal treatment at [[Abu Ghraib prison]], which had once been used by the government of [[Saddam Hussein]], and had been taken over by the United States after the invasion. On June 20, 2003, Abdel Salam Sidahmed, Deputy Director of AI's Middle East Program, described an uprising by the prisoners against the conditions of their detention, saying "The notorious Abu Ghraib Prison, centre of torture and mass executions under Saddam Hussein, is yet again a prison cut off from the outside world. On 13 June there was a protest in this prison against indefinite detention without trial. Troops from the occupying powers killed one person and wounded seven."&lt;ref name="AI 2003"/&gt;

On July 23, 2003, Amnesty International issued a press release condemning widespread human rights abuses by U.S. and coalition forces. The release stated that prisoners had been exposed to extreme heat, not provided clothing, and forced to use open trenches for toilets. They had also been tortured, with the methods including denial of sleep for extended periods, exposure to bright lights and loud music, and being restrained in uncomfortable positions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.amnesty.nl/nieuwsportaal/pers/continuing-failure-uphold-human-rights |title=Iraq: Continuing failure to uphold human rights |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=July 23, 2003 |publisher=Amnesty International |accessdate=February 6, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160207004452/http://www.amnesty.nl/nieuwsportaal/pers/continuing-failure-uphold-human-rights |archivedate=February 7, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 1, 2003, the [[Associated Press]] presented a special report on the massive human rights abuses at Abu Ghraib. Their report began; "In Iraq's American detention camps, forbidden talk can earn a prisoner hours bound and stretched out in the sun, and detainees swinging tent poles rise up regularly against their jailers, according to recently released Iraqis." The report went on to describe abuse of the prisoners at the hands of their American captors: "'They confined us like sheep,' the newly freed Saad Naif, 38, said of the Americans. 'They hit people. They humiliated people.'" In response, U.S. Brigadier-General Janis Karpinski, at the time in charge of all U.S. detention facilities in Iraq, claimed that prisoners were being treated "humanely and fairly."&lt;ref name="AP 2003"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://legacy.utsandiego.com/news/world/iraq/20031101-0936-iraq-thecamps.html |title=AP Enterprise: Former Iraqi detainees tell of riots, punishment in the sun, good Americans and pitiless ones |last1=Hanley |first1=Charles J. |last2= |first2= |date=November 1, 2003 |website=utsandiego.com |publisher=San Diego Union Tribune |accessdate=April 22, 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140503221406/http://legacy.utsandiego.com/news/world/iraq/20031101-0936-iraq-thecamps.html |archivedate=May 3, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The AP report also stated that as of November 1, 2003, there were two legal cases pending against U.S. military personnel, one involving the beating of an Iraqi prisoner, the other about the death of a prisoner in custody.&lt;ref name="AP 2003"/&gt;

Since the beginning of the invasion, the [[International Committee of the Red Cross]] (ICRC) had been allowed to oversee the prison, and submitted reports about the treatment of the prisoners. In response to an ICRC report, Brigadier General [[Janis Karpinski]], who oversaw all US detention facilities in Iraq, stated that several of the prisoners were intelligence assets, and therefore not entitled to complete protection under the [[Geneva Convention]].&lt;ref name="ASIL 2004"&gt;{{cite journal|title=U.S. Abuse of Iraqi Detainees at Abu Ghraib Prison|journal=The American Journal of International Law|date=July 2004|volume=98|issue=3|pages=591–596|jstor=3181656}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ICRC reports led to Lieutenant General [[Ricardo Sanchez]], the commander of the Iraqi task force, appointing Major General [[Antonio Taguba]] to investigate the allegations on 1 January 2004.&lt;ref name="ASIL 2004"/&gt; Taguba submitted his findings (the [[Taguba Report]]) in February 2004, stating that "numerous incidents of sadistic, blatant, and wanton criminal abuses were inflicted on several detainees.

The scandal came to widespread public attention In April 2004, when a ''[[60 Minutes II]]'' news report was aired on April 28 by [[CBS News]], describing the abuse, including pictures showing military personnel taunting naked prisoners.&lt;ref name=Smeulers/&gt;&lt;ref name="ASIL 2004"/&gt;{{sfn|Greenberg|Dretel|2005|p=xiii}}&lt;ref name="Fast facts"/&gt; An article was published by [[Seymour M.

Shortly afterwards, U.S. President [[George W.

===Executive Order===
On December 21, 2004, the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] released copies of internal memoranda from the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] that it had obtained under the [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|Freedom of Information Act]]. These discussed torture and abuse at prisons in [[Guantanamo Bay]], [[Afghanistan]], and [[Iraq]]. One memorandum dated May 22, 2004 was from an individual described as the "On Scene Commander – Baghdad," but whose name had been redacted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.aclu.org/torturefoia/released/FBI.121504.4940_4941.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-12-04 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130309123054/http://www.aclu.org/torturefoia/released/FBI.121504.4940_4941.pdf |archivedate=March 9, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; This individual referred explicitly to an [[Executive order (United States)|Executive Order]] that sanctioned the use of extraordinary interrogation tactics by U.S. military personnel. The torture methods sanctioned included sleep deprivation, [[hooding]] prisoners, playing loud music, removing all detainees' clothing, forcing them to stand in so-called "stress positions", and the use of dogs. The author also stated that [[the Pentagon]] had limited use of the techniques by requiring specific authorization from the [[command hierarchy|chain of command]]. The author identifies "physical beatings, sexual humiliation or touching" as being outside the Executive Order. This was the first internal evidence since the Abu Ghraib prisoner abuse affair became public in April 2004 that forms of coercion of captives had been mandated by the president of the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.aclu.org/safefree/general/19913leg20050712.html |title=American Civil Liberties Union: ACLU Interested Persons Memo on FBI documents concerning detainee abuse at Guantanamo Bay |publisher=Aclu.org |date=July 12, 2005 |accessdate=April 3, 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091017092853/http://www.aclu.org/safefree/general/19913leg20050712.html |archivedate=October 17, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Authorization from Ricardo Sanchez ===

Documents obtained by ''[[The Washington Post]]'' and the ACLU showed that [[Ricardo Sanchez]], who was a Lieutenant General and the senior U.S. military officer in Iraq, authorized the use of military dogs, temperature extremes, reversed sleep patterns, and sensory deprivation as interrogation methods in Abu Ghraib.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A35612-2004Jun11.html | title=General Granted Latitude At Prison | date=June 12, 2004 | work=The Washington Post | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070808011210/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A35612-2004Jun11.html | archivedate=August 8, 2007 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; A November 2004 report by Brigadier General Richard Formica found that many troops at the Abu Ghraib prison had been following orders based on a memorandum from Sanchez, and that the abuse had not been carried out by isolated "criminal" elements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Wrong advice blamed for US abuse |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/5090372.stm |work=BBC NEWS AMERICAS |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |date=June 17, 2006 |accessdate=February 3, 2007 |quote="[...] most defendants say they were following orders." | location=London| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070104045041/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/5090372.stm| archivedate= January 4, 2007 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; ACLU lawyer Amrit Singh said in a statement from the union that "General Sanchez authorized interrogation techniques that were in clear violation of the Geneva Conventions and the army's own standards."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=US memo shows Iraq jail methods |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/4392519.stm |work=BBC NEWS AMERICAS |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |date=March 30, 2005 |accessdate=February 3, 2007 |quote="The top US general in Iraq authorised interrogation techniques including the use of dogs, stress positions and disorientation, a memo has shown." |location=London |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060526082709/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/4392519.stm |archivedate=May 26, 2006 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In an interview for her hometown newspaper ''The Signal'', Karpinski stated that she had seen unreleased documents from Defense Secretary [[Donald Rumsfeld]] which authorized the use of these tactics on Iraqi prisoners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author = Leon Worden |url= http://www.scvhistory.com/scvhistory/signal/iraq/sg070204.htm | title= Karpinski: Rumsfeld OK'd Methods at Abu Ghraib | publisher= [[Santa Clarita Valley Historical Society]] | accessdate=July 4, 2004| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20040704031819/http://www.scvhistory.com/scvhistory/signal/iraq/sg070204.htm| archivedate= July 4, 2004 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alleged authorization from Donald Rumsfeld===
A 2004 report by the ''[[The New Yorker|New Yorker]]'' stated that Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld had authorized the interrogation tactics used in Abu Ghraib, and which had previously been used by the US in Afghanistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2004-05-16/rumsfeld-approved-iraq-interrogation-methods-report/1976460 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-09-17 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161010221210/http://www.abc.net.au/news/2004-05-16/rumsfeld-approved-iraq-interrogation-methods-report/1976460 |archivedate=October 10, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2006, Janis Karpinski, who had been in charge of Abu Ghraib prison until early 2004, told Spain's ''[[El País (Madrid)|El País]]'' newspaper that she had seen a letter signed by Rumsfeld, which allowed civilian contractors to use techniques such as [[sleep deprivation]] during interrogation. "The methods consisted of making prisoners stand for long periods, sleep deprivation ... playing music at full volume, having to sit in uncomfortably ... Rumsfeld authorized these specific techniques."&lt;ref name="Reuters 2006"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-iraq-rumsfeld-idUSL2572641320061125|title=Rumsfeld okayed abuses says former U.S. general|work=Reuters|accessdate=17 September 2016|date=25 November 2006|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160917162407/http://www.reuters.com/article/us-iraq-rumsfeld-idUSL2572641320061125|archivedate=September 17, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Karpinski, the handwritten signature was above his printed name, and the comment "Make sure this is accomplished" was in the margin in the same hand-writing.&lt;ref name="Reuters 2006"/&gt; Neither the Pentagon nor U.S. Army spokespeople in Iraq commented on the accusation. In 2006, a criminal complaint was filed in a German Court against Donald Rumsfeld by eight former soldiers and intelligence operatives, including Karpinski and former army counterintelligence special agent David DeBatto. Among other things, the complaint stated that Rumsfeld both knew of and authorized enhanced interrogation techniques that he knew to be illegal under international law.&lt;ref name="Reuters 2006"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ccrjustice.org/ourcases/current-cases/german-war-crimes-complaint-against-donald-rumsfeld%2C-et-al. |title=German Criminal Complaint Against Donald Rumsfeld |publisher=CCR |accessdate=March 31, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150516075342/http://ccrjustice.org/ourcases/current-cases/german-war-crimes-complaint-against-donald-rumsfeld%2C-et-al. |archivedate=May 16, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/L25726413.htm |title=– "Rumsfeld okayed abuses says former U.S. Army general" Reuters News |publisher=Alertnet.org |date=March 30, 2012 |accessdate=April 3, 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081109025627/http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/L25726413.htm |archivedate=November 9, 2008 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.classactionworld.com/cases/german-war-crimes-litigation-against-donald-rumsfeld-et-al | title=German Court War Crimes Litigation Against Donald Rumsfeld | publisher=Class Action World | accessdate=March 31, 2014 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407070816/http://www.classactionworld.com/cases/german-war-crimes-litigation-against-donald-rumsfeld-et-al | archivedate=April 7, 2014 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ccrjustice.org/ourcases/current-cases/german-war-crimes-complaint-against-donald-rumsfeld%2C-et-al. |title=German Case Again Donald Rumsfeld filed by CCR |publisher=Center for Constitutional Rights |accessdate=March 31, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150516075342/http://ccrjustice.org/ourcases/current-cases/german-war-crimes-complaint-against-donald-rumsfeld%2C-et-al. |archivedate=May 16, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Systematic torture===
[[File:Abu Ghraib 64.jpg|thumb|A detainee handcuffed in the nude to a bed with female [[panties]] soaked in urine covering his face.]]

On May 7, 2004, [[Pierre Krähenbühl]], Operations Director for the [[International Committee of the Red Cross]] (ICRC), stated that inspection visits made by the ICRC to detention centers run by the U.S. and its allies showed that acts of prisoner abuse were not isolated acts, but were part of a "pattern and a broad system." He went on to say that some of the incidents they had observed were "tantamount to torture".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/3694521.stm | title=Red Cross saw 'widespread abuse' | date=May 8, 2004 | work=BBC News | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040722000029/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/3694521.stm | archivedate=July 22, 2004 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Armed forces in the U.S. and the UK are jointly trained in techniques known as ''[[R2I|resistance to interrogation]] (R2I)'' techniques. These R2I techniques are taught ostensibly to help soldiers cope with, or resist, torture if they are captured. On May 8, 2004, ''[[The Guardian]]'' reported that according to a former British special forces officer, the acts committed by the Abu Ghraib prison military personnel resembled the techniques used in R2I training.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://politics.guardian.co.uk/iraq/story/0,12956,1212199,00.html | location=London | title=UK forces taught torture methods | date=May 8, 2004 | work=The Guardian | first=David | last=Leigh | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040530070404/http://politics.guardian.co.uk/iraq/story/0,12956,1212199,00.html | archivedate=May 30, 2004 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian [[Alfred W.

He asserts that what he calls "the CIA's no-touch torture methods" have been in continuous use by the CIA and the U.S. military intelligence since that time.&lt;ref&gt;McCoy, Alfred W.

When the U.S. military first acknowledged the abuse in early 2004, much of the [[Media of the United States|United States media]] once again showed little initial interest. On January 16, 2004, the [[United States Central Command]] informed the media that an official investigation had begun involving abuse and [[humiliation]] of Iraqi detainees by a group of U.S. soldiers.

[[File:Abu Ghraib prison abuse.jpg|thumb|Sergeant [[Ivan Frederick]] sitting on an Iraqi detainee between two stretchers]]

In late April 2004, the U.S. television news-magazine ''[[60 Minutes II]]'', a franchise of [[CBS]], broadcast a story on the abuse. The story included photographs depicting the abuse of prisoners.&lt;ref name="main614063.shtml"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2004/04/27/60II/main614063.shtml | work=CBS News | title=Abuse Of Iraqi POWs By GIs Probed | date=April 27, 2004 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070208135011/http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2004/04/27/60II/main614063.shtml | archivedate=February 8, 2007 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The news segment was delayed by two weeks at the request of the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] and [[Richard Myers]], an air force general and [[Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff]]. After learning that ''[[The New Yorker]]'' magazine planned to publish an article and photographs on the topic in its next issue, CBS proceeded to broadcast its report on April 28.&lt;ref name="zmag itemID 7926"/&gt; In the CBS report, [[Dan Rather]] interviewed then-deputy director of Coalition operations in Iraq, Brigadier General [[Mark Kimmitt]], who said:

{{Quote|The first thing I'd say is we're appalled as well. These are our fellow soldiers. These are the people we work with every day, and they represent us. They wear the same uniform as us, and they let their fellow soldiers down [...] Our soldiers could be taken prisoner as well. And we expect our soldiers to be treated well by the adversary, by the enemy. And if we can't hold ourselves up as an example of how to treat people with dignity and respect [...] We can't ask that other nations do that to our soldiers as well. [...] So what would I tell the people of Iraq? This is wrong. This is reprehensible. But this is not representative of the 150,000 soldiers that are over here [...] I'd say the same thing to the American people ... Don't judge your army based on the actions of a few.''&lt;ref name="main614063.shtml" /&gt;''}}

Kimmitt also acknowledged that he knew of other cases of abuse during the American occupation of Iraq.&lt;ref name="main614063.shtml"/&gt; Bill Cowan, a former Marine lieutenant colonel, was also interviewed, and said: "We went into Iraq to stop things like this from happening, and indeed, here they are happening under our tutelage."&lt;ref name="main614063.shtml"/&gt; In addition, Rather interviewed Army Reserve Staff Sergeant [[Ivan Frederick]], who was party to some of the abuses. Frederick's civilian job was as a corrections officer at a Virginia prison. He said, "We had no support, no training whatsoever. And I kept asking my chain of command for certain things ... like rules and regulations, and it just wasn't happening."&lt;ref name="main614063.shtml"/&gt; Frederick's video diary, sent home from Iraq, provided some of the images used in the story. In it he listed detailed, dated, entries that chronicled abuse of CIA prisoners, as well as their names: "The next day the medics came in and put his body on a stretcher, placed a fake [intravenous drip] in his arm and took him away. This [CIA prisoner] was never processed and therefore never had a number."&lt;ref name="shane"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2004-05-01/news/0405010122_1_prisoner-military-intelligence-cells|title=Soldier's diary details wider abuse at prison - Baltimore Sun|last=Shane|first=Scott|date=May 1, 2004|work=[[The Baltimore Sun]]|accessdate=March 5, 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150610195115/http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2004-05-01/news/0405010122_1_prisoner-military-intelligence-cells|archivedate=June 10, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Frederick implicated the [[Military Intelligence Corps (United States Army)|Military Intelligence Corps]] as well, saying "MI has been present and witnessed such activity. MI has encouraged and told us great job [and] that they were now getting positive results and information."&lt;ref name="shane"/&gt;

===''New Yorker'' article, 2004===
In 2004, [[Seymour M. Hersh]] published an article in ''The New Yorker'' magazine discussing the abuses in detail, and used as its source a copy of the Taguba report. Under the direction of editor [[David Remnick]], the magazine also posted a report on its website by Hersh, along with a number of images of the torture taken by U.S. military prison guards. The article, entitled "Torture at Abu Ghraib", was followed in the next two weeks by two further articles on the same subject, "Chain of Command" and "The Gray Zone", also by Hersh.&lt;ref name="zmag itemID 7926"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zmag.org/content/showarticle.cfm?SectionID=15&amp;ItemID=7926 |archive-url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20090701041008/http://www.zmag.org/content/showarticle.cfm?SectionID=15&amp;ItemID=7926 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=July 1, 2009 |title=ZNet &amp;#124;Iraq &amp;#124; Abu Ghraib |publisher=Zmag.org |accessdate=April 3, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later coverage, 2006===
In February 2006, previously unreleased photos and videos were broadcast by [[Special Broadcasting Service|SBS]], an Australian television network, on its [[Dateline (Australian TV program)|''Dateline'']] program. The Bush administration attempted to prevent release of the images in the U.S., arguing that their publication could provoke antagonism. These newly released photographs depicted prisoners crawling on the floor naked, being forced to perform sexual acts, and being covered in feces. Some images also showed prisoners killed by the soldiers, some shot in the head and some with slit throats. BBC World News stated that one of the prisoners, who was reportedly mentally unstable, was considered by prison guards as a "pet" for torture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://smh.com.au/news/world/the-photos-america-doesnt-want-seen/2006/02/14/1139890737099.html# |title=The photos America doesn't want seen – World – |work=Sydney Morning Herald |accessdate=April 3, 2012 |date=February 15, 2006 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120412221602/http://www.smh.com.au/news/world/the-photos-america-doesnt-want-seen/2006/02/14/1139890737099.html |archivedate=April 12, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The UN expressed hope that the pictures would be investigated immediately, but the Pentagon stated that the images "have been previously investigated as part of the Abu Ghraib investigation."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.news.com.au/story/0,10117,18166472-26619,00.html Anger at Abu Ghraib photos | NEWS.com.au&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071107133700/http://www.news.com.au/story/0%2C10117%2C18166472-26619%2C00.html |date=November 7, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 15, 2006, [[Salon (website)|Salon]] published what was then the most extensive documentation of the abuse.&lt;ref name="Salon 2006"&gt;{{cite web|last=Greenwald |first=Glenn |url=http://salon.com/news/abu_ghraib/2006/03/14/introduction/index.html |title=Abu Ghraib Files – Salon.com News |publisher=Salon.com |accessdate=April 3, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110916223055/http://www.salon.com/news/abu_ghraib/2006/03/14/introduction/index.html/ |archivedate=September 16, 2011 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; A report accessed by Salon included the following summary of the material: "A review of all the computer media submitted to this office revealed a total of 1,325 images of suspected detainee abuse, 93 video files of suspected detainee abuse, 660 images of adult pornography, 546 images of suspected dead Iraqi detainees, 29 images of soldiers in simulated sexual acts, 20 images of a soldier with a Swastika drawn between his eyes, 37 images of Military Working dogs being used in abuse of detainees and 125 images of questionable acts."&lt;ref name="Salon 2006"/&gt;

The news website [[AsiaNews]] quoted Yahia Said, an Iraqi scholar at the [[London School of Economics]], as saying: "The reception [of the news about Abu Ghraib] was surprisingly low-key in Iraq. Part of the reason was that rumors and tall stories, as well as true stories, about abuse, mass rape, and torture in the jails and in coalition custody have been going round for a long time. So compared to what people have been talking about here the pictures are quite benign. There's nothing unexpected. In fact what most people are asking is: why did they come up now? People in Iraq are always suspecting that there's some scheming going on, some agenda in releasing the pictures at this particular point."&lt;ref name=iraqreaction1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asianews.it/view.php?l%3Den%26art%3D791 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-02-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929134347/http://www.asianews.it/view.php?l=en&amp;art=791 |archivedate=September 29, 2007 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[CNN]] reporter [[Ben Wedeman]] reported that Iraqi reaction to George W. Bush's apology for the Abu Ghraib abuses was "mixed": "Some people react[ed] positively, saying that he's come out, he's dealing frankly and openly with the problem and that he has said that those involved in the abuse will be punished. On the other hand, there are many others who says it simply isn't enough, that they—many people noted that there was not a frank apology from the president for this incident. And, in fact, I have a Baghdad newspaper with me right now from—it's called 'Dar-es-Salaam.' That's from the Islam Iraqi Islamic Party. It says that an apology is not enough for the torture [...] of Iraqi prisoners."&lt;ref name=cnnreaction&gt;{{cite news|url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0405/06/lad.04.html|title=''Live At Daybreak''|publisher=|accessdate=September 16, 2014|work=CNN|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150610203109/http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0405/06/lad.04.html|archivedate=June 10, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Stanley A. McChrystal|General Stanley McChrystal]], who held several command positions in the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, said that, "In my experience, we found that nearly every first-time jihadist claimed Abu Ghraib had first jolted him into action."{{sfn|McChrystal|2013|p=172}} He also said that, "mistreating detainees would discredit us. ... The pictures [from] Abu Ghraib represented a setback for America's efforts in Iraq. Simultaneously undermining U.S. domestic confidence in the way in which America was operating, and creating or reinforcing negative perceptions worldwide of American values, it fueled violence".{{sfn|McChrystal|2013|pp=200-201}}

On May 7, 2004 [[Nick Berg]], an American businessman who went to Iraq after the [[History of Iraq (2003–11)|US Invasion]], was captured and decapitated by the Islamist militant organization [[Muntada al-Ansar|al-Ansars]] in response to Abu Ghraib.&lt;ref&gt;A book on "torture doctors" stated, "Television carried the Abu Ghraib photographs on April 28, 2004.  The first of [[w:Beheading video|eleven beheadings in Iraq]] occurred twelve days later."  {{Citation | last = Miles| first = Steven H. | author-link = Steven H. Miles| year = 2009| title = Oath Betrayed:  American's Torture Doctors | publisher = U. of California Pr. | page = 162| isbn = 978-0-520-25968-3}} The Wikipedia article on [[w:Beheading video|"Beheading video"]] is a close but imperfect match for this quote from Miles.  On 2015-11-27, this Wikipedia article listed a beheading in Paikistan almost 27 months before the Abu Ghraib revelations.  It then lists 10 beheadings in the next 6 months.  The next video is just over 4 years later on Feb. 7, 2009 in Pakistan, possibly before Miles' completed his book.  This count of beheadings seems consistent with Miles' comment, even if it does not match perfectly.  Miles continues, "Pursuing justice differs from being consumed by revenge.  The former proceeds from crime to investigation, to trial, to punishment, and then to closure.  Vengeance is a whirlwind, where atrocity justifies revenge, and revenge becomes an atrocity."&lt;/ref&gt; The masked man who carried out the execution is believed to have been [[Abu Musab al-Zarqawi]].

===Response of U.S. government===
The [[Presidency of George W. Bush|Bush administration]] did not initially acknowledge the abuses at Abu Ghraib. After the pictures were published and the evidence became incontrovertible, the initial reaction from the administration characterized the scandal as an isolated incident uncharacteristic of U.S. actions in Iraq.&lt;ref name="Smeulers"/&gt; Bush described the abuses as the actions of a few individuals, who were disregarding the values of the US.&lt;ref name="Smeulers"/&gt; This view was widely disputed, notably in Arab countries. In addition, the [[International Red Cross]] had been making representations about abuse of prisoners for more than a year before the scandal broke.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.derechos.org/nizkor/us/doc/icrc-prisoner-report-feb-2004.pdf |title=Report of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) on the Treatment by the Coalition Forces of Prisoners of War and Other Protected Persons by the Geneva Conventions in Iraq During Arrest, Internment and Interrogation |publisher=ICRC |date=February 2004 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513090151/http://www.derechos.org/nizkor/us/doc/icrc-prisoner-report-feb-2004.pdf |archivedate=May 13, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars studying the abuses have stated that the abuses were part of a widespread pattern. Vice-president [[Dick Cheney]]'s office had played a central role in eliminating limits on coercion in U.S. custody, commissioning and defending legal opinions that the administration later portrayed as the initiatives of lower-ranking officials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://voices.washingtonpost.com/cheney/chapters/pushing_the_envelope_on_presi/|title=Pushing the Envelope on Presidential Power|publisher=|accessdate=September 16, 2016|work=The Washington Post|date=January 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 7, 2004, United States Secretary of Defense [[Donald Rumsfeld]] stated in a hearing before the [[Senate Armed Services Committee]]:

{{Quote|These events occurred on my watch. As Secretary of Defense, I am accountable for them. I take full responsibility. It is my obligation to evaluate what happened, to make sure those who have committed wrongdoing are brought to justice, and to make changes as needed to see that it doesn't happen again. I feel terrible about what happened to these Iraqi detainees. They are human beings. They were in U.S. custody. Our country had an obligation to treat them right. We didn't do that. That was wrong. To those Iraqis who were mistreated by members of U.S. armed forces, I offer my deepest apology. It was un-American. And it was inconsistent with the values of our nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://italy.usembassy.gov/viewer/article.asp?article=/file2004_05/alia/a4050713.htm |title=Rumsfeld Apologizes to Iraqis Abused by U.

He also commented on the very existence of the evidence of abuse:
{{Quote|We're functioning in a – with peacetime restraints, with legal requirements in a wartime situation, in the information age, where people are running around with digital cameras and taking these unbelievable photographs and then passing them off, against the law, to the media, to our surprise, when they had not even arrived in the Pentagon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Washington |first=The |url=http://www.washtimes.com/national/20040507-115901-6736r.htm |title=Washington Times – Iraq prisoner abuse 'un-American,' says Rumsfeld |publisher=Washtimes.com |date=May 7, 2004 |accessdate=April 3, 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070613172647/http://www.washtimes.com/national/20040507-115901-6736r.htm |archivedate=June 13, 2007 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Rumsfeld was careful to draw a distinction between abuse and [[torture]]: "What has been charged so far is abuse, which I believe technically is different from torture. I'm not going to address the 'torture' word."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://nytimes.com/2004/05/23/opinion/23HOCH.html|title=What's in a Word?

[[James Inhofe]], a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] member of the [[U.S. Senate Committee on Armed Services]], stated that the events were being blown out of proportion: "I'm probably not the only one up at this table that is more outraged by the outrage than we are by the treatment [...] [They] are not there for traffic violations. [...] these prisoners—they're murderers, they're terrorists, they're insurgents. [...] Many of them probably have American blood on their hands.

On May 26, 2004, [[Al Gore]] gave a sharply critical speech on the scandal and the Iraq War. He called for the resignations of Rumsfeld, [[National Security Advisor (United States)|National Security Advisor]] [[Condoleezza Rice]], CIA Director [[George Tenet]], Deputy Secretary of Defense [[Paul Wolfowitz]], Under Secretary of Defense for Policy [[Douglas J. Feith]], and Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence [[Stephen A. Cambone]], for encouraging policies that led to the abuse of Iraqi prisoners and fanned hatred of Americans abroad. Gore also called the Bush administration's Iraq war plan "incompetent" and described Bush as the most dishonest president since [[Richard Nixon]]. Gore commented; "In Iraq, what happened at that prison, it is now clear, is not the result of random acts of a few bad apples. It was the natural consequence of the Bush Administration policy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moveonpac.org/goreremarks052604.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040609101212/http://www.moveonpac.org/goreremarks052604.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=June 9, 2004 |title=MoveOn PAC |publisher=MoveOn PAC |accessdate=April 3, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rumsfeld was also criticized by both Republican and Democrat lawmakers, including Senators [[John Kerry]], and [[Joe Biden]], and [[House Minority Leader]] [[Nancy Pelosi]].

The revelations were also the impetus for the creation of the [[Fay Report]], named for its lead author [[George Fay]], as well as the [[Taguba Report]].

===United States media===
[[File:RumsfeldEconomist.jpg|thumb|upright|right|A headline from ''The Economist'', calling for Secretary Rumsfeld's resignation]]

Several periodicals, including ''The New York Times'' and ''[[The Boston Globe]]'', called for Rumsfeld's resignation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Rumsfeld must go|date=May 7, 2004|work=Boston Globe|url=http://www.boston.com/news/globe/editorial_opinion/editorials/articles/2004/05/07/rumsfeld_must_go/|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040602215537/http://www.boston.com/news/globe/editorial_opinion/editorials/articles/2004/05/07/rumsfeld_must_go/|archivedate=June 2, 2004|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cover of ''[[The Economist]]'', which had backed President Bush in the 2000 election, carried a photo of the abuse with the words "Resign, Rumsfeld."

Right-wing radio host [[Rush Limbaugh]] contended that the events were being blown out of proportion, stating that "this is no different than what happens at the [[Skull and Bones]] initiation, and we're going to ruin people's lives over it and we're going to hamper our military effort, and then we are going to really hammer them because they had a good time. You know, these people are being fired at every day. I'm talking about people having a good time, these people, you ever heard of emotional release?

==Repercussions==

===Convictions of soldiers===
[[File:Navy consolidated brig -- Mirimar CA.jpg|thumb|[[Naval Consolidated Brig, Miramar]], where [[Lynndie England|England]] and Harman served their sentences]]

Eleven soldiers were convicted of various charges relating to the incidents, with all of the convictions including the charge of [[dereliction of duty]]. Most soldiers only received minor sentences. Three other soldiers were either cleared of charges or were not charged. No one was convicted for the murders of the detainees.

* Colonel [[Thomas Pappas]] was relieved of his command on May 13, 2005, after receiving [[non-judicial punishment]] for two instances of dereliction of duty, including that of allowing dogs to be present during interrogations. He was fined $8000 under the provisions of Article 15 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice (non-judicial punishment). He also received a General Officer Memorandum of Reprimand which effectively ended his military career. He did not face criminal prosecution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2005/may/12/20050512-111801-2679r/ |title=Colonel loses command for abuses |publisher=Washington Times |date=12 May 2005 |accessdate=2016-08-08 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160809110733/http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2005/may/12/20050512-111801-2679r/ |archivedate=August 9, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal issues==

===International law===

The United States has ratified the [[United Nations Convention against Torture]] and the [[Third Geneva Convention|Third]] and [[Fourth Geneva Convention]]s. The [[Presidency of George W. Bush|Bush Administration]] took the position that: "Both the United States and Iraq are parties to the Geneva Conventions. The United States recognizes that these treaties are binding in the war for the 'liberation of Iraq'".&lt;ref&gt;Alberto Gonzales, OP-ED: "The Rule of Law and the Rules of War", ''New York Times'', May 15, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Abu Ghraib 22.jpg|thumb|A U.S. soldier beats a bleeding Iraqi detainee]]

The Convention Against Torture defines [[torture]] in the following terms:
{{Quote|For the purposes of this Convention, the term "torture" means any act by which severe pain or suffering, whether physical or mental, is intentionally inflicted on a person for such purposes as obtaining from him or a third person, information or a confession, punishing him for an act he or a third person has committed or is suspected of having committed, or intimidating or coercing him or a third person, or for any reason based on discrimination of any kind, when such pain or suffering is inflicted by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity. It does not include pain or suffering arising only from, inherent in or incidental to lawful sanctions.|[[United Nations Convention Against Torture]]|(Article 1)}}
[[File:Abu Ghraib 29.JPG|thumb|upright=0.5|A nude prisoner used as a target for shooting practice by U.S. soldiers.]]

According to [[Human Rights Watch]]:
{{quote|Al-Qaeda detainees would likely not be accorded [[Prisoner of War]] (POW) status, but the Conventions still provide explicit protections to all persons held in an international armed conflict, even if they are not entitled to POW status. Such protections include the right to be free from coercive interrogation, to receive a fair trial if charged with a criminal offense, and, in the case of detained civilians, to be able to appeal periodically the security rationale for continued detention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.hrw.org/en/node/12123/section/3 |title="The Road to Abu Ghraib", Human Rights Watch |publisher=Hrw.org |date=June 9, 2004 |accessdate=April 3, 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121011111447/http://www.hrw.org/en/node/12123/section/3 |archivedate=October 11, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The [[International Committee of the Red Cross]] (ICRC) concluded in its confidential February 2004 report to the Coalition Forces (CF) that it had documented 
{{quote|serious violations of International Humanitarian Law relating to the conditions of treatment of the persons deprived of their liberty held by the CF in Iraq. In particular, it establishes that persons deprived of their liberty face the risk of being subjected to a process of physical and psychological coercion, in some cases tantamount to torture, in the early stages of the internment process.&lt;ref name="ICRC04report"/&gt;}}

There were several major violations described in the ICRC report. These included brutality against protected persons upon capture and initial custody, sometimes causing death or serious injury; absence of notification of arrest of persons deprived of their liberty to their families causing distress among persons deprived of their liberty and their families; physical or psychological coercion during interrogation to secure information; prolonged solitary confinement in cells devoid of daylight; excessive and disproportionate use of force against persons deprived of their liberty resulting in death or injury during their period of internment.&lt;ref name="ICRC04report"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.derechos.org/nizkor/us/doc/icrc-prisoner-report-feb-2004.pdf |title=Report of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) on the Treatment by the Coalition Forces of Prisoners of War and Other Protected Persons by the Geneva Conventions in Iraq During Arrest, Internment and Interrogation (section 3.1) |publisher=ICRC |date=February 2004 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513090151/http://www.derechos.org/nizkor/us/doc/icrc-prisoner-report-feb-2004.pdf |archivedate=May 13, 2008 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some legal experts have said that the United States could be obligated to try some of its soldiers for [[war crimes]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2013}} Under the Third and Fourth Geneva Conventions, prisoners of war and civilians detained in a war may not be treated in a degrading manner, and violation of that section is a "grave breach". In a November 5, 2003 report on prisons in Iraq, the Army's provost marshal, Maj. Gen. Donald J. Ryder, stated that the conditions under which prisoners were held sometimes violated the Geneva Conventions.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

===United Nations resolution 1546===
In December 2005, John Pace, human rights chief for the United Nations Assistance Mission in Iraq (UNAMI), criticized the U.S. military's practice of holding Iraqi prisoners in Iraqi facilities such as Abu Ghraib. Pace stated that this practice was not mandated by UN Resolution 1546, according to which the U.S. government has claimed a legal mandate permitting its ongoing occupation of Iraq. Pace said, "All except those held by the Ministry of Justice are, technically speaking, held against the law because the Ministry of Justice is the only authority that is empowered by law to detain, to hold anybody in prison. Essentially none of these people have any real recourse to protection and therefore we speak ... of a total breakdown in the protection of the individual in this country."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in ''The Age'', December 6, 2005, {{cite web |url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/world/america-abusing-mandate-in-iraq/2005/12/05/1133631201911.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-06-23 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060516033839/http://www.theage.com.au/news/world/america-abusing-mandate-in-iraq/2005/12/05/1133631201911.html |archivedate=May 16, 2006 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Torture Memos===
[[Alberto Gonzales]] and other senior administration lawyers argued that detainees at the [[Guantanamo Bay detention camp]] and other similar prisons should be considered "[[unlawful combatant]]s" and were not protected by the [[Geneva Conventions]]. These opinions were issued in multiple memoranda, known today as the "[[Torture Memos]]," in August 2002, by the [[Office of Legal Counsel]] (OLC) in the [[United States Department of Justice|U.S. Justice Department]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/news/feature/2006/02/23/yoo/index_np.html |title=Walter Shapiro, "Parsing pain" |publisher= |accessdate=September 16, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080307223219/http://www.salon.com/news/feature/2006/02/23/yoo/index_np.html |archivedate=March 7, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They were written by [[John Yoo]], deputy assistant attorney-general in the OLC, and two of three were signed by his boss [[Jay Bybee|Jay S. Bybee]]. (The latter was appointed as a federal judge in 2003, starting March 21, 2003.) An additional memo was issued on March 14, 2003, after the resignation of Bybee, and just prior to the American invasion of Iraq. In it, Yoo concluded that federal laws prohibiting the use of torture did not apply to U.S. practices overseas.&lt;ref name="Haynes"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/newsweek/2008/04/05/a-top-pentagon-lawyer-faces-a-senate-grilling-on-torture.html|title=A Top Pentagon Lawyer Faces a Senate Grilling On Torture|publisher=|accessdate=September 16, 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120115012641/http://www.thedailybeast.com/newsweek/2008/04/05/a-top-pentagon-lawyer-faces-a-senate-grilling-on-torture.html|archivedate=January 15, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gonzales observed that denying coverage under the Geneva Conventions, "substantially reduces the threat of domestic criminal prosecution under the [[War Crimes Act of 1996|War Crimes Act]]."&lt;ref name="Holtzman"/&gt; Congressman [[Elizabeth Holtzman]] wrote that Gonzales's statement suggested that policy was crafted to ensure that the actions of U.S. officials could not be considered [[war crimes]].&lt;ref name="Holtzman"&gt;[http://www.thenation.com/doc.mhtml?i=20050718&amp;s=holtzman Elizabeth Holtzman, "Torture and Accountability"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070311055805/http://www.thenation.com/doc.mhtml?i=20050718&amp;s=holtzman |date=March 11, 2007 }}, ''[[The Nation]]'', posted June 28, 2005 (July 18, 2005 issue) about The Geneva Convention &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.democracynow.org/article.pl?sid=05/06/30/1333214 |title=Former NY Congress member Holtzman Calls For President Bush and His Senior Staff To Be Held Accountable for Abu Ghraib Torture |work=Democracy Now! |accessdate=September 16, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071114040412/http://www.democracynow.org/article.pl?sid=05%2F06%2F30%2F1333214 |archivedate=November 14, 2007 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://msnbc.msn.com/id/4999734/ Michael Isikoff, "Memos Reveal War Crimes Warnings"], '' Newsweek'', May 19, 2004 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100920053941/http://msnbc.msn.com/id/4999734/ |date=September 20, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalpolicy.org/security/issues/iraq/attack/law/2003/0128uslawyers.htm|title=US Lawyers Warn Bush on War Crimes|publisher=|accessdate=September 16, 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150718210406/https://www.globalpolicy.org/security/issues/iraq/attack/law/2003/0128uslawyers.htm|archivedate=July 18, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other legal proceedings===
In ''[[Hamdan v. Rumsfeld]]'' (2006), the [[Supreme Court of the United States|US Supreme Court]] ruled that Common Article Three of the Geneva Conventions applied to all detainees in the [[War on Terror]]. It said that the [[Guantanamo military commission|military tribunals]] used to try these suspects were in violation of U.S. and international law. It said that the president could not unilaterally establish such tribunals, and that Congress needed to authorize a means by which detainees could confront their accusers and challenge their detention.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/13773997/site/newsweek/ Michael Isikoff and Stuart Taylor Jr., "The Gitmo Fallout: The fight over the Hamdan ruling heats up—as fears about its reach escalate"], ''Newsweek,'' July 17, 2006 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070512175803/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/13773997/site/newsweek/ |date=May 12, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 27, 2011, the U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear the appeals of lawsuits from a group of 250 Iraqis who wanted to sue [[CACI]] International Inc. and [[Titan Corporation|Titan Corp.]] (now a subsidiary of [[L3 Technologies|L-3 Communications]]), the two private contractors at Abu Ghraib, over claims of abuse by interrogators and translators at the prison. The suits had been dismissed by the lower courts on the grounds that the companies held a derivative sovereign immunity from suits based on their status as government contractors pursuant to a battle-field preemption doctrine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.seattlepi.com/national/politico/article/SCOTUS-nixes-Iraqis-lawsuit-1441885.php | work=Seattle Post-Intelligencer | title=SCOTUS nixes Iraqis' lawsuit | date=June 27, 2011 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121018012323/http://www.seattlepi.com/national/politico/article/SCOTUS-nixes-Iraqis-lawsuit-1441885.php | archivedate=October 18, 2012 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.andyworthington.co.uk/2011/06/28/us-supreme-court-refuses-to-allow-abu-ghraib-torture-victims-to-sue-military-contractors/ |title=US Supreme Court Refuses to Allow Abu Ghraib Torture Victims to Sue Military Contractors |publisher=Andy Worthington |accessdate=April 3, 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120502195241/http://www.andyworthington.co.uk/2011/06/28/us-supreme-court-refuses-to-allow-abu-ghraib-torture-victims-to-sue-military-contractors/ |archivedate=May 2, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2014, the U.S. court of appeals in Richmond, Virginia, found that an 18th-century law known as the [[Alien Tort Statute]], allowed non-US citizens access to U.S. courts for violations of "the law of nations or a treaty of the United States". This would enable abused Iraqis to file suit against contractor CACI International. Employees of CACI International are being accused of encouraging torture and abuse as well as taking part in it as the four Iraqi's contend that they were "repeatedly shot in the head with a taser gun", "beaten on the genitals with a stick", and forced to watch the "rape [of] a female detainee", during their time at the prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/law/2014/jun/30/iraq-lawsuit-defense-contractor-torture-abu-graib|title=Abu Ghraib torture suit against contractor revived by federal court - Law - theguardian.com|author=Spencer Ackerman|work=the Guardian|accessdate=September 16, 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140805225638/http://www.theguardian.com/law/2014/jun/30/iraq-lawsuit-defense-contractor-torture-abu-graib|archivedate=August 5, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Torture Central]]'' chronicled many events previously unreported in the news media, including torture that continued at Abu Ghraib over a year after the abuse photos were published.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.torturecentral.com| title=Torture Central| author=Michael Keller|year=2007| accessdate=November 11, 2007| publisher=iUniverse| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071123092432/http://www.torturecentral.com/| archivedate= November 23, 2007 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, the last of the prisons were turned over to the Iraqi government to run. An [[Associated Press]] article said {{quote|Despite Abu Ghraib- or perhaps because of reforms in its wake- prisoners have more recently said they receive far better treatment in American custody than in Iraqi jails.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | first=Sameer | last=Yacoub | title=Changing of the guard at last U.S. run prison | url=| publisher=Burlington Free Press | location=Burlington, Vermont | pages= 8A | date=July 15, 2010 | id= }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In September 2010, [[Amnesty International]] warned in a report titled ''New Order, Same Abuses; Unlawful Detentions and Torture in Iraq'' that up to 30,000 prisoners, including many veterans of the U.S. detention system, remain detained without rights in Iraq and are frequently tortured or abused. Furthermore, it describes a detention system that has not evolved since Saddam Hussein's regime, in which human rights abuses were endemic with arbitrary arrests and secret detention common and a lack of accountability throughout the military forces. Amnesty's Middle East and North Africa director, Malcolm Smart went on to say: "Iraq's security forces have been responsible for systematically violating detainees' rights and they have been permitted. U.S. authorities, whose own record on detainees' rights has been so poor, have now handed over thousands of people detained by U.S. forces to face this catalogue of illegality, violence and abuse, abdicating any responsibility for their human rights."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Martin Chulov |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/sep/23/iraq-prisons-and-probation |title=Abuse and torture rife in Iraqi prisons |work=The Guardian |accessdate=April 3, 2012 |date=September 23, 2010 |location=London |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130917001303/http://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/sep/23/iraq-prisons-and-probation |archivedate=September 17, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 22, 2010, nearly 400,000 secret United States Army [[Iraq War documents leak|field reports and war logs]], detailing torture, summary executions and war crimes, were passed on to the British paper, ''[[The Guardian]]'', and several other international media organisations through the [[Whistleblower|whistleblowing]] website [[WikiLeaks]]. Among other things, the logs detail how U.S. authorities failed to investigate hundreds of reports of abuse, torture, rape, and even murder by Iraqi police and soldiers, whose conduct appeared to be systematic and normally unpunished, and that U.S. troops abused prisoners for years even after the Abu Ghraib scandal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Nick Davies, Jonathan Steele and David Leigh |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/oct/22/iraq-war-logs-military-leaks |title=Iraq war logs: secret files show how U.S. ignored torture |work=The Guardian |accessdate=April 3, 2012 |date=October 22, 2010 |location=London |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130730184021/http://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/oct/22/iraq-war-logs-military-leaks |archivedate=July 30, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/10/22/wikileaks-iraq-war-logs-i_n_772658.html |title=WikiLeaks' Iraq War Logs: US Troops Abused Prisoners For Years After Abu Ghraib |work=Huffington Post |accessdate=April 3, 2012 |first=Marcus |last=Baram |date=October 22, 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120910182334/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/10/22/wikileaks-iraq-war-logs-i_n_772658.html |archivedate=September 10, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, Associated Press stated that Engility Holdings, of [[Chantilly, Virginia]], paid $5.28 million in a settlement to 71 former inmates held at Abu Ghraib and other U.S.-run detention sites between 2003 and 2007. The settlement was the first successful attempt by the detainees to obtain reparations for the abuses they had experienced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=$5M PAID IRAQIS OVER ABU GHRAIB ABUSE|url=http://bigstory.ap.org/article/apnewsbreak-5m-paid-iraqis-over-abu-ghraib-abuse|work=Associated Press|accessdate=January 8, 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130111231504/http://bigstory.ap.org/article/apnewsbreak-5m-paid-iraqis-over-abu-ghraib-abuse|archivedate=January 11, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Anomie''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|æ|n|ə|ˌ|m|i}}) is a "condition in which society provides little [[Morality|moral]] guidance to individuals".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gerber |first=John J. Macionis, Linda M. |title=Sociology |year=2010 |publisher=Pearson Canada |location=Toronto |isbn=978-0-13-700161-3 |pages=97 |edition=7th Canadian}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the breakdown of social bonds between an individual and the community, e.g., under unruly scenarios resulting in fragmentation of social identity and rejection of self-regulatory [[Value (ethics)|values]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://roomfordebate.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/05/13/chinas-school-killings-and-social-despair/?ref=world NYtimes blogs]&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} 

The term is commonly understood to mean ''normlessness'', and believed to have been popularized by French sociologist [[Émile Durkheim]] in his influential book ''[[Suicide (book)|Suicide]]'' (1897). However, Durkheim first introduces the concept of anomie in his 1893 work ''The Division of Labour In Society''. Durkheim never used the term ''normlessness''; rather, he described anomie as "derangement", and "an insatiable will".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Mestrovic |first=Stjepan |title=Emile Durkheim and The Reformation of Sociology}}&lt;/ref&gt; Durkheim used the term "the malady of the infinite" because desire without limit can never be fulfilled; it only becomes more intense.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/43421884|title=Emile Durkheim : law in a moral domain|last=M.),|first=Cotterrell, Roger (Roger B.|publisher=|year=1999|isbn=0804738238|location=|pages=19|oclc=43421884|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For Durkheim, anomie arises more generally from a mismatch between personal or group standards and wider social standards, or from the lack of a social ethic, which produces moral deregulation and an absence of legitimate aspirations. This is a nurtured condition:
{{quote |Most sociologists associate the term with Durkheim, who used the concept to speak of the ways in which an individual's actions are matched, or integrated, with a system of social norms and practices … anomie is a mismatch, not simply the absence of norms. Thus, a society with too much rigidity and little individual discretion could also produce a kind of anomie ...&lt;ref name="quot0"&gt;Susan Leigh Star, Geoffrey C. Bowker, and Laura J. Neumann, "Transparency At Different Levels of Scale: Convergence between Information Artifacts and Social Worlds", Library and Information Science, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, August 1997&lt;/ref&gt;|sign=|source=}}

== History ==
In 1893 Durkheim introduced the concept of ''anomie'' to describe the mismatch of collective guild labour to evolving societal needs when the guild was homogeneous in its constituency. He equated homogeneous (redundant) skills to ''mechanical solidarity'' whose inertia retarded adaptation. He contrasted this with the self-regulating behaviour of a division of labour based on differences in constituency, equated to ''organic solidarity'', whose lack of inertia made it sensitive to needed changes.

Durkheim observed that the conflict between the evolved organic division of labour and the homogeneous mechanical type was such that one could not exist in the presence of the other.&lt;ref name="quot1"&gt;The Division of Labor in Society, The MacMillan Co. 1933, Free Press edition, 1964, pp. 182-183&lt;/ref&gt;

When solidarity is organic, anomie is impossible.&lt;ref name="quot4"&gt;The Division of Labor in Society, The MacMillan Co. 1933, Free Press edition, 1964, pp. 368-369&lt;/ref&gt; Sensitivity to mutual needs promotes evolution in the division of labour. "Producers, being near consumers, can easily reckon the extent of the needs to be satisfied. Equilibrium is established without any trouble and production regulates itself."&lt;ref name="quot4"/&gt; Durkheim contrasted the condition of anomie as being the result of a malfunction of organic solidarity after the transition to mechanical solidarity: {{quote|But on the contrary, if some opaque environment is interposed ... relations [are] rare, are not repeated enough ... are too intermittent. Contact is no longer sufficient. The producer can no longer embrace the market at a glance, nor even in thought. He can no longer see its limits, since it is, so to speak limitless. Accordingly, production becomes unbridled and unregulated.&lt;ref name="quot4"/&gt;}}

Durkheim's use of the term anomie was about the phenomenon of industrialization—mass-regimentation that could not adapt due to its own inertia—its resistance to change, which causes disruptive cycles of collective behavior e.g. economics, due to the necessity of a prolonged buildup of sufficient force or momentum to overcome the inertia.

Later in 1897, in his studies of suicide, Durkheim associated anomie to the influence of a lack of norms or norms that were too rigid. But such normlessness or norm-rigidity was a ''symptom of anomie'', caused by the lack of differential adaptation that would enable norms to evolve naturally due to self-regulation, either to develop norms where none existed or to change norms that had become rigid and obsolete.

In 1938 Robert K. Merton linked anomie with [[Robert K. Merton#Theory of deviance|deviance]] and argued that the discontinuity between culture and structure have the dysfunctional consequence of leading to deviance within society. He described 5 types of deviance in terms of the acceptance or rejection of social goals and the institutionalized means of achieving them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Merton|first=Robert K.|date=1938|title=Social Structure and Anomie|jstor=2084686|journal=American Sociological Review|volume=3|issue=5|pages=672–682|doi=10.2307/2084686}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
{{See also|Antinomianism}}
The word, "a reborrowing with French spelling of ''anomy''",&lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD|anomie}}&lt;/ref&gt; comes from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|ἀνομία}} "lawlessness",&lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD|anomy}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|a)nomi/a|ἀνομία|ref}}.&lt;/ref&gt; namely the [[privative alpha]] [[Prefix (linguistics)|prefix]] (''a-'' "without"), and ''nomos'' "law". The Greeks distinguished between ''nomos'' ({{lang|grc|νόμος}}, "law"), and ''arché'' ({{lang|grc|ἀρχή}}, "starting rule, axiom, principle"). For example, a [[monarch]] is a single ruler but he or she might still be subject to, and not exempt from, the prevailing laws, i.e. ''nomos''. In the original [[city state]] [[democracy]], the [[majority rule]] was an aspect of ''arché'' because it was a rule-based, customary system, which might or might not make laws, i.e. ''nomos''. Thus, the original meaning of ''anomie'' defined anything or anyone against or outside the law, or a condition where the current laws were not applied resulting in a state of illegitimacy or lawlessness.

The contemporary English understanding of the word ''anomie'' can accept greater flexibility in the word "[[norm (sociology)|norm]]", and some have used the idea of normlessness to reflect a similar situation to the idea of [[Anarchism|anarchy]]. But, as used by Émile Durkheim and later theorists, ''anomie'' is a reaction against or a retreat from the regulatory [[social control]]s of [[society]], and is a completely separate concept from anarchy, which consists of the absence of the roles of rulers and submitted.

== Social disorder ==

The nineteenth century [[France|French]] pioneer [[sociologist]] Émile Durkheim borrowed the word from French philosopher [[Jean-Marie Guyau]] and used it in his influential book ''[[Suicide (book)|Suicide]]'' (1897), outlining the social (and not individual) causes of [[suicide]], characterized by a rapid change of the standards or values of societies (often erroneously referred to as normlessness), and an associated feeling of [[Social alienation|alienation]] and purposelessness. He believed that ''anomie'' is common when the surrounding society has undergone significant changes in its economic fortunes, whether for better or for worse and, more generally, when there is a significant discrepancy between the ideological theories and values commonly professed and what was actually achievable in everyday life. This was contrary to previous theories on suicide which generally maintained that suicide was precipitated by negative events in a person's life and their subsequent [[clinical depression|depression]].

In Durkheim's view, traditional [[religion]]s often provided the basis for the shared values which the anomic individual lacks. Furthermore, he argued that the [[division of labor]] that had been prevalent in economic life since the [[Industrial Revolution]] led individuals to pursue [[egotism|egoistic]] ends rather than seeking the good of a larger community. [[Robert King Merton]] also adopted the idea of anomie to develop [[Strain theory (sociology)|strain theory]], defining it as the discrepancy between common social goals and the legitimate means to attain those goals. In other words, an individual suffering from anomie would strive to attain the common goals of a specific society yet would not be able to reach these goals legitimately because of the [[structuralism|structural]] limitations in society. As a result, the individual would exhibit [[deviance (sociology)|deviant behavior]]. [[Friedrich Hayek]] notably uses the word ''anomie'' with this meaning.

According to one academic survey, psychometric testing confirmed a link between anomie and [[academic dishonesty]] among university students, suggesting that universities needed to foster codes of ethics among students in order to curb it.&lt;ref&gt;"The effect of anomie on academic dishonesty among university students" by Albert Caruana, B. Ramaseshan, Michael T. Ewing. ''International Journal of Educational Management'' (2000). Volume 14, issue 1. pp. 23–30.&lt;/ref&gt; In another study, anomie was seen as a "push factor" in tourism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As an older variant, the 1913 ''[[Webster's Dictionary]]'' reports use of the word ''anomie'' as meaning "disregard or violation of the law"&lt;ref&gt;"Anomie, authoritarianism, and prejudice: A replication" by A. H. Roberts, M. Rokeach, ''American Journal of Sociology'', 1956&lt;/ref&gt; but anomie as a social disorder is not to be confused with [[anarchy]]. Proponents of [[anarchism]] claim that anarchy does not necessarily lead to anomie and that hierarchical command actually increases lawlessness. Some [[anarcho-primitivism|anarcho-primitivists]] argue that complex societies, particularly industrial and post-industrial societies, directly cause conditions such as anomie by depriving the individual of self-determination and a relatively small reference group to relate to, such as the band, clan, or tribe.

In [[Albert Camus]]'s [[existentialist novel]] ''[[The Stranger (Camus novel)|The Stranger]]'', the bored, alienated protagonist Meursault struggles to construct an individual system of values as he responds to the disappearance of the old.

In [[Sikhism]], '''{{transl|pa|chardi kala}}''' is the Punjabi term for aspiring to maintain a mental state of eternal [[optimism]] and [[joy]]. Sikhs are ideally expected to be in this positive state of mind as a sign of their contentment with the [[will of God]] (''{{transl|pa|bhana}}''), even during the times of adversity.&lt;ref name="Rebecca2012"&gt;{{cite book | author=Rebecca Sachs Norris | title=Religion and the Body: Modern Science and the Construction of Religious Meaning | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QyV1NwzcfJsC&amp;pg=PA240 | access-date=16 February 2013 | date=17 February 2012 | publisher=BRILL | isbn=978-90-04-22111-6 | pages=240–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It can be translated as "positive attitude"{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} or "ascending energy".&lt;ref name="Rebecca2012"/&gt; It is also described as being in "high spirits" or “positive, buoyant and optimistic” attitude to life and to the future. Chardi kala is the state of mind in which a person has no negative emotions like [[fear]], [[jealousy]] or [[enmity]]. Instead the mind has many positive feelings including joy, satisfaction and self-dignity.&lt;ref&gt;Dr. Harjinder Singh Majhail, 2010. Philosophy of 'Charhdi Kala' and Higher State of Mind in Sri Guru Granth Sahib. Deepak Publishers, Jallandhar.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sikhs believe in the will of God (''bhana''). They also believe that the God is without enemies (''nirvair''), and is always merciful. Hence, the humans should accept his will even at times one suffers severe hardship. Thus, chardi kala is the indicator of a Sikh’s absolute faith in the [[Akal Purakh]] (the God). This attitude allows one to face the hardships with as little harm as possible. This also involves joining and helping others in their hour of need.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4988">[[File:RandomPoints.gif|right|thumb|upright=1.5|Up to 10,000 points randomly distributed inside a square with apparent "clumps" or clusters]]
The '''clustering illusion''' is the tendency to erroneously consider the inevitable "streaks" or "clusters" arising in small samples from random distributions to be non-random. The illusion is caused by a human tendency to underpredict the amount of [[Statistical dispersion|variability]] likely to appear in a small sample of random or semi-random data.&lt;ref name="gilovich"&gt;{{cite book|last=Gilovich|first=Thomas|title=How we know what isn't so: The fallibility of human reason in everyday life|year=1991|publisher=The Free Press|location=New York|isbn=0-02-911706-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
[[Thomas Gilovich]], an early author on the subject, argued that the effect occurs for different types of random dispersions, including two-dimensional data such as  clusters in the locations of impact of [[World War II]] [[V-1 flying bomb]]s on maps of London; or seeing patterns in [[stock market]] price fluctuations over time.&lt;ref name="gilovich" /&gt;&lt;ref name="kv"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kahneman|first=Daniel|author2=Amos Tversky|title=Subjective probability: A judgment of representativeness|journal=Cognitive Psychology|year=1972|volume=3|pages=430–454|doi=10.1016/0010-0285(72)90016-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Londoners developed specific theories about the pattern of impacts within London, a statistical analysis by R. D. Clarke originally published in 1946 showed that the impacts of [[V-2 rocket]]s on London were a close fit to a random distribution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Clarke|first=R. D.|title=An application of the Poisson distribution|journal=Journal of the Institute of Actuaries|year=1946|volume=72|page=481|url=https://www.actuaries.org.uk/documents/application-poisson-distribution}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gilovich, 1991 p. 19&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mori|first=Kentaro|title=Seeing patterns|url=http://forgetomori.com/2009/skepticism/seeing-patterns/|accessdate=3 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bombing London|url=http://www.dur.ac.uk/stat.web/bomb.htm|accessdate=3 March 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120221221013/http://www.dur.ac.uk/stat.web/bomb.htm|archive-date=2012-02-21|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tierney"&gt;{{cite news|last=Tierney|first=John|title=See a pattern on Wall Street?|url=http://tierneylab.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/10/03/see-a-pattern-here/|publisher=New York Times|work=TierneyLab|accessdate=3 March 2012|format=October 3, 2008|authorlink=John Tierney (journalist)|date=3 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The clustering illusion is central to the "[[hot hand fallacy]]", the first study of which was reported by Gilovich, Robert Vallone and [[Amos Tversky]]. They found that the idea that [[basketball]] players shoot successfully in "streaks", sometimes referred to by sportcasters as having a "hot hand" and widely believed by Gilovich et al.'s subjects, was false. In the data they collected, if anything the success of a previous throw very slightly predicted a subsequent miss rather than another success.&lt;ref name="grt"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gilovich |first=Thomas |author2=Robert Vallone |author3=Amos Tversky |title=The hot hand in basketball: On the misperception of random sequences |journal=Cognitive Psychology |year=1985 |volume=17 |pages=295–314 |url=http://www.psych.cornell.edu/sec/pubPeople/tdg1/Gilo.Vallone.Tversky.pdf |doi=10.1016/0010-0285(85)90010-6 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120113003955/http://www.psych.cornell.edu/sec/pubPeople/tdg1/Gilo.Vallone.Tversky.pdf |archivedate=January 13, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Similar biases==
Using this [[cognitive bias]] in causal reasoning may result in the [[Texas sharpshooter fallacy]]. More general forms of erroneous pattern recognition are ''[[pareidolia]]'' and ''[[apophenia]]''. Related biases are the ''[[illusion of control]]'' which the clustering illusion could contribute to, and ''[[insensitivity to sample size]]'' in which people don't expect greater variation in smaller samples. A different cognitive bias involving misunderstanding of chance streams is the [[gambler's fallacy]].

==Possible causes==
[[Daniel Kahneman]] and [[Amos Tversky]] explained this kind of misprediction as being caused by the [[representativeness heuristic]]&lt;ref name="kv"/&gt; (which itself they also first proposed).

==Contrast with experience==
One may experience physical objects using the five senses. In contrast, one may counter-experience revelation, a spiritual presence, or an awareness. Feelings of [[Sublime (philosophy)|sublimity]] or awe are often indicators of counter-experience.&lt;ref&gt;Hart, Kevin (2005) [http://www.pacifica.org.au/volumes/volume18/issue03/poetry-and-revelation-hopkins-counterexperience Poetry and Revelation: Hopkins, Counter-Experience and ''Reductio''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110304144024/http://www.pacifica.org.au/volumes/volume18/issue03/poetry-and-revelation-hopkins-counterexperience/ |date=2011-03-04 }}.

'''Countering Violent Extremism Task Force''', or '''CVE''', is a US government program established under the [[Obama administration]] to counter all violent ideologies, held by groups or individuals in the US, by engaging communities in the [[counterterrorism]] effort and by education programs or counter-messaging. The program works with community groups such as local governments, police departments, universities, and non-profits.

In December 2016, the incoming [[Trump presidency|Trump]] presidential transition team planned to stop the program from targeting [[white supremacy|white supremacists]], which have committed bombings and shootings such as at a [[Charleston church shooting|black church in Charleston]]. The program was also planned to be renamed to "Countering Radical Islamic Extremism". [[US Congress|Congressional]] [[GOP|Republicans]] have criticized CVE for being [[political correctness|politically correct]], arguing that using the term "Radical Islam" would prevent violent attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ainsley|first1=Julia Edwards|last2=Volz|first2=Dustin|last3=Cooke|first3=Kristina|last4=Hosenball|first4=Mark|title=Exclusive: Trump to focus counter-extremism program solely on Islam - sources|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-extremists-program-exclusiv-idUSKBN15G5VO|accessdate=August 12, 2017|work=Reuters|date=February 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Acosta|first1=Jim|last2=Watkins|first2=Eli|title=Trump admin eyes scrapping anti-extremism program|url=http://www.cnn.com/2017/02/01/politics/trump-countering-violent-extremism/index.html|accessdate=12 August 2017|work=CNN|date=February 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gjelten|first1=Tom|title=Trump Reportedly Plans To Refocus Violent Extremism Initiative On Muslims|url=https://www.npr.org/2017/02/10/514566938/trump-reportedly-plans-to-refocus-violent-extremism-initiative-on-muslims|accessdate=August 12, 2017|work=NPR|date=February 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Evon|first1=Dan|title=Did President Trump Remove White Supremacists from the Terror Watch Program?|url=http://www.snopes.com/trump-terror-watch-program/|website=Snopes|accessdate=12 August 2017|date=February 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Beirich|first1=Heidi|title=Trump's planned changes to government's 'Countering Violent Extremism' program are politically motivated, dangerous|url=https://www.splcenter.org/news/2017/02/02/splc-trumps-planned-changes-governments-countering-violent-extremism-program-are|website=Southern Poverty Law Center|accessdate=August 12, 2017|date=February 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Community groups have had concerns that the program could be used to target [[world religions|faith groups]] for [[targeted surveillance|surveillance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Green|first1=Emma|title=What Lies Ahead for Obama's Countering Violent Extremism Program?|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/03/countering-violent-extremism/519822/|accessdate=August 12, 2017|work=The Atlantic|date=March 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Southers|first1=Erroll|title=The U.S. government’s program to counter violent extremism needs an overhaul|url=http://www.latimes.com/opinion/la-fg-global-erroll-southers-oped-20170321-story.html|accessdate=August 12, 2017|work=Los Angeles Times|date=March 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Montemayor|first1=Stephen|title=As Washington debates how to counter terrorism, Minnesota groups press ahead|url=http://www.startribune.com/as-washington-debates-how-to-counter-extremism-minnesota-groups-press-ahead/439497193/|accessdate=August 12, 2017|work=Star Tribune|date=August 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Countering Violent Extremism|url=https://www.lawfareblog.com/topic/countering-violent-extremism|website=Lawfare|accessdate=August 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Problem with “Countering Violent Extremism” Programs|url=https://www.aclu.org/other/problem-countering-violent-extremism-programs|website=American Civil Liberties Union|accessdate=August 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2017, the Trump White House proposed to cut all funding to CVE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ainsley|first1=Julia Edwards|title=White House budget slashes 'countering violent extremism' grants|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-budget-extremism-idUSKBN18J2HJ|accessdate=12 August 2017|work=Reuters|date=May 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2017, George Selim, a Republican who worked in the [[Presidency of George W.

The '''crumbling skull rule''' is a well-established [[legal doctrine]] used in some [[tort law]] systems.  It holds that where a plaintiff had a condition or injury that predates the tort and would have naturally deteriorated or worsened over time (e.g. a crumbling skull), the defendant is not responsible to the degree that the condition or injury would have naturally worsened over time.  A defendant is only liable for the degree the injury was worsened or the hastening or acceleration of the damage caused by the tort.  The crumbling skull rule should not be confused with the related [[Eggshell skull|thin skull rule]].&lt;ref&gt;''Athey v. Leonati'', [1996] 3 S.C.R. 458, at para. 34-36, online at: http://canlii.ca/t/1fr63&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept is sometimes applied without specific reference to the crumbling skull rule, instead being expressed as a non-absolute application of the thin skull rule.&lt;ref&gt;''Kavanagh v Akhtar Matter No Ca 40492/97'', [1998] NSWSC 779, online at: http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWSC/1998/779.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The Commonwealth v WL McLean: Developments Inconsistent with the Traditional Nature of the Egg Shell Scull Principle |first=Tanya |last=Jones |url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/journals/JCULawRw/2001/6.pdf |journal=James Cook University Law Review |date= 2001 |accessdate=22 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11024">The traditional [[culture of the Southern United States]] has been called a "culture of [[honor]]", that is, a culture where people avoid intentionally offending others, and maintain a [[reputation]] for not accepting improper conduct by others. A prevalent theory as to why the American South had or may have this culture is an assumed regional belief in [[Retributive justice|retribution]] to enforce one's rights and deter predation against one’s family, home and possessions. The concept was tested by social scientists [[Richard Nisbett]] and Dov Cohen in their book ''Culture of Honor''&lt;ref name="Nisbett, R.E. 1996"&gt;Nisbett, R.E., &amp; Cohen, D. (1996). ''Culture of honor: The psychology of violence in the South''. Boulder, CO: Westview Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and repopularized by a discussion in Chapter Six of ''[[Outliers (book)|Outliers]]'' by [[Malcolm Gladwell]].

==Background==

The "culture of honor" in the Southern United States is hypothesized by some social scientists&lt;ref name="Nisbett, R.E. 1996"/&gt; to have its roots in the livelihoods of the early settlers who first inhabited the region.  Unlike settlers with an agricultural heritage (mainly from the densely populated [[South East England]] and [[East Anglia]]) who settled in [[New England]], the [[Southern United States]] was settled by herders from [[Scotland]], [[Northern Ireland]], [[Northern England]] and the [[West Country]].{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}  Herds, unlike crops, are vulnerable to theft because they are mobile and there is little government wherewithal to enforce property rights of herd animals. The theory is that developing a reputation for violent retribution against those who stole herd animals was one way to discourage [[Cattle raiding|theft]].

This thesis is limited, however, by modern evidence that a culture of honor in the American South is strongest not in the hill country, where this thesis suggests it has its cultural origins, but in Southern lowlands.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-human-beast/200904/is-southern-violence-due-culture-honor Nigel Barber, "Is Southern violence due to a culture of honor?", ''[[Psychology Today]]'' (April 2, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; These observers argue that [[poverty]] or [[religion]], which has been distinctive in the American South since the [[Second Great Awakening]] in the 19th century, may be a more important source of this cultural phenomenon.

Other theories  point out that the culture of honor may have its roots in the settlement of the region by members of British aristocratic families.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=PqWR2y-FKfYC&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role of women==

The Southern culture of honor also includes a notion that [[Lady|ladies]] should not be insulted by [[gentlemen]]. Southern gentlemen are also expected to be [[Chivalry|chivalrous]] towards women, in words and deeds.

Although "culture of honor" qualities have been generally associated with men in the southern United States, women in this region have also been affected and even shown some of the same qualities. In ''Culture of Honor'', it is stated that women play a part in the culture, both "through their role in the socialization process, as well as active participation." By passing these ideas along to their children, they are taking part in [[social conditioning]].&lt;ref name="Culture of Honor p. 119"&gt;{{cite book|author=Richard E. Nisbett and Dov Cohen|title=Culture of Honor: The Psychology of Violence in the South|year=1996|publisher=Colorado: Westview Press, Inc.|pages=119|url=http://personal.tcu.edu/swoodworth/cultureofhonor.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Psychology==

Laboratory research has demonstrated that men in honor cultures perceive interpersonal threats more readily than do men in other cultures, including increases in cortisol and testosterone levels following insults.&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, D., Nisbett, R. E., Bowdle, B. F., &amp; Schwarz, N., "Insult, aggression, and the southern culture of honor: An "experimental ethnography." 70(5) ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology'' 945-960 (1996), ''available at'' http://www.simine.com/240/readings/Cohen_et_al_(2).pdf (last visited February 10, 2013).&lt;/ref&gt;   In culture-of-honor states, high school students were found to be more likely to bring a weapon to school in the past month and over a 20-year period, there were more than twice as many school shootings per capita.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Ryan P., Osterman, Lindsey L., &amp; Barnes, Collin D. "School Violence and the Culture of Honor," 20(11) ''Psychological Science'' 1400-1405 (2009), ''available at'' http://www.uta.fi/arkisto/aktk/projects/sta/Brown_Osterman_Barnes_2009_School-Violence-and-the-Culture-of-Honour.pdf (last visited February 10, 2013).&lt;/ref&gt; According to Lindsey Osterman and Ryan Brown in ''Culture of Honor and Violence Against the Self'', "[i]ndividuals (particularly Whites) living in honor states are at an especially high risk for committing suicide."&lt;ref&gt;Osterman, L. L. &amp; Brown, R. P., "Culture of Honor and Violence Against the Self," 37(12) ''Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin'' 1611-1623 (2011), ''available at'' https://www.academia.edu/1069747/Culture_of_Honor_and_Violence_Against_the_Self (last visited February 10, 2013).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sociology==
The historian [[David Hackett Fischer]], a Professor of History at [[Brandeis University]], makes a  case for an enduring genetic basis for a "willingness to resort to violence" (citing especially the finding of high blood levels of [[testosterone]] as discussed [[#Psychology|above]]) in the four main chapters of his book ''[[Albion's Seed]]''.&lt;ref&gt; particularly the chapter titled "Borderlands to the Backcountry: The Flight from Middle Britain and Northern Ireland, 1717-1775"&lt;/ref&gt; He proposes that a Southern propensity for violence is inheritable by genetic changes wrought over generations living in traditional herding societies in [[Northern England]], the [[Scottish Borders]], and Irish [[Border Region]]. He proposes that this propensity has been transferred to other ethnic groups by shared culture, whence it can be traced to different urban populations of the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[[David Hackett Fischer]], ''[[Albion's Seed: Four British Folkways in America]]'', ({{ISBN|0-19-506905-6}}), [[Oxford University Press]], 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; However, honor cultures were and are widely prevalent in Africa&lt;ref&gt;Iliffe, John. ''Honour in African History''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2005. xxiv + 404 pp. {{ISBN|978-0-521-54685-0}} (paper), {{ISBN|978-0-521-83785-9}} (cloth).&lt;/ref&gt; and many other places.

Randolph Roth, in his ''American Homicide'' (2009), states that the idea of a culture of honor is oversimplified.&lt;ref name="Roth2009"&gt;{{cite book|last=Roth|first=Randolph|title=American Homicide|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DNTu6vYe9wgC|accessdate=17 November 2016|date=30 October 2009|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-05454-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; He argues that the violence often committed by Southerners resulted from social tensions. He hypothesizes that when people feel that they are denied social success or the means to attain it, they will be more prone to commit violent acts. His argument is that Southerners were in tension, possibly due to poor Whites being marginalized by rich Whites, free and enslaved Blacks being denied basic rights, and rich and politically empowered Whites having their power threatened by Northern politicians pushing for more federal control of the South, especially over [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolition]]. He argues that issues over honor just triggered the already present hostility, and that people took their frustration out through violent acts often on the surface over issues of honor. He draws historical records of violence across the U.S. and [[Europe]] to show that violence largely accompanies perceptions of political weakness and the inability to advance oneself in society. Roth also shows that although the South was "obsessed with honor" in the mid-18th century, there was relatively little homicide. &lt;!--{{Clarify|including or excluding duels and other killings widely seen as justified?|date=October 2010}}--&gt; Barring under-reported crime against some groups, low homicide may simply have been [[Gentleman#Robert E. Lee|gentlemanly self-restraint]] at a time when social order was stable, a trend that reverses in the 19th century and later.{{efn|name=fn1}}

== War ==
A 2016 study suggests that honor culture increases the risk of war. The study found that international conflicts under Southern presidents are "twice as likely to involve uses of force, last on average twice as long, and are three times more likely to end in victory for the United States than disputes under non-Southern presidents. Other characteristics of Southern presidencies do not seem able to account for this pattern of results."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dafoe|first=Allan|last2=Caughey|first2=Devin|date=2016-04-01|title=Honor and War|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/article_S0043887115000416|journal=World Politics|volume=68|issue=02|pages=341–381|doi=10.1017/S0043887115000416|issn=1086-3338}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notes==
{{notelist|refs=
{{efn|name=fn1|In ''American Homicide'', Randolph Roth charts changes in the character and incidence of homicide in the U.S. from colonial times to the present. Roth argues that the United States is distinctive in its level of violence among unrelated adults—friends, acquaintances, and strangers. America was extraordinarily homicidal in the mid-seventeenth century, but it became relatively non-homicidal by the mid-eighteenth century, even in the slave South; and by the early nineteenth century, rates in the North and the mountain South were extremely low. But the homicide rate rose substantially among unrelated adults in the slave South after the American Revolution; and it skyrocketed across the United States from the late 1840s through the mid-1870s, while rates in most other Western nations held steady or fell. That surge—and all subsequent increases in the homicide rate—correlated closely with four distinct phenomena: political instability; a loss of government legitimacy; a loss of fellow-feeling among members of society caused by racial, religious, or political antagonism; and a loss of faith in the social hierarchy. Those four factors, Roth argues, best explain why homicide rates have gone up and down in the United States and in other Western nations over the past four centuries, and why the United States is today the most homicidal affluent nation.&lt;ref name="Roth2009" /&gt;}}

'''Dance criticism''' in the United States is the act of producing a written or spoken review of a [[performance dance|dance]] performance (often [[ballet]], [[modern dance]], or [[contemporary dance]]). The term may also refer to the report itself, which may act as an archived review, critique, or highlight. As with other topics, dance criticism may employ its own [[technical language]], and may also reflect the critic's opinions. Major newspapers cover the arts in some form and dance criticism may be included.  Dance criticism is available in other types of media as well, such as online publishing&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.blouinartinfo.com/news/story/1236568/decoding-the-phantasmagoria-of-wayne-mcgregors-tree-of-codes|title=Decoding the phantasmagoria of Wayne McGregor's 'Tree of Codes'|last=Daris|first=Gabriella|date=15 September 2015|work=Blouin Artinfo|access-date=March 3, 2018|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, through blogs, websites, and online videos. 

==Current dance critics==
Throughout the 20th century dance critiques were primarily available through newspaper and magazine writing.  With the improvement of technology criticism has become increasingly available through social media platforms and blogs.  This has heavily influenced the way the general public views dance art forms.

'''Delia Villegas Vorhauer''' (April 17 1940 – June 1, 1992) was an American [[Latina]] social worker, who successfully ran programs to assist the [[Hispanic]] communities in Illinois, Ohio and Michigan. She was awarded a presidential medal for her efforts in development. She founded Mujeres Unidas de Michigan as an advocacy group for Spanish-speaking women and as a result of their activism the group sent six delegates to the [[1977 National Women's Conference]], which was a part of the UN [[International Women's Year]] programs. Vorhauer served as vice chair of the delegation to the conference. She authored the ''Mason Miller Report'', an evaluation of minorities and higher education, which became the model for analyzing participation of minorities in colleges and universities throughout Michigan, leading to a state bi-lingual education law. When she lost her sight, due to [[diabetes]], Vorhauer became an advocate for the blind. She was inducted into the [[Michigan Women's Hall of Fame]] in 1990, the first Latina to be honored in the hall.

==Early life==
Delia Villegas was born on April 17, 1940 in [[El Paso, Texas]] to Consuelo (née Olivares) and Dr. Bernardo Villegas.{{sfn|''The Lansing State Journal''|1992|p=14}} Her father was an [[optometrist]], as had been his father, and the couple raised their two older sons and Delia, as well as their adopted daughter Rebecca in the traditions of their Mexican heritage.{{sfn|Burns|2006|pp=131–132}} Villegas attended Catholic school across the border in Juarez, Mexico. At the age of thirteen, based on the family history and her perusal of her father’s medical books, Villegas diagnosed herself with diabetes, which the family physician confirmed.{{sfn|Burns|2006|pp=132–133}} She attended [[El Paso High School]], becoming the editor of the school newspaper, ''The Tatler''.{{sfn|''The Lansing State Journal''|1992|p=14}}{{sfn|Burns|2006|p=133}} Upon her graduation, Villegas moved to [[Chicago]], where the family had relatives and enrolled [[Rosary College]], in nearby [[River Forest, Illinois]] in 1958. She graduated with a bachelor's degree in [[sociology]] in 1962.{{sfn|Burns|2006|pp=133–134}}

==Career==
Upon graduation, Villegas began her career as a [[social worker]] in the children's services department for Chicago working with adoptions and protective services. She also published a weekly column, ''Servicio Social'' in the local Spanish newspaper.{{sfn|Burns|2006|p=134}} In 1964, when the [[Manpower Development and Training Act]] (MDTA) was expanded to include training and development programs for the non-English speaking population, Villegas was hired as a director of the program by the Archdiocesan Latin American Committee (ALAC) to help them implement services in the Chicago area. Besides giving [[vocational training]] and English lessons, the ALAC provided family and financial counseling services, as well as medical referral information.{{sfn|Pinkerton|April 27, 1967|p=109}} Special programs were also provided to target Chicago's [[Puerto Ricans|Puerto Rican]] populations, providing them with adult language courses.{{sfn|Pinkerton|May 7, 1967|p=399}} In 1967, Villegas was one of five women out of fifty-two speakers called to testify before President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]]'s Cabinet Commttee Hearing on all aspects of life, except the draft and women's issues, impacting the Hispanic community in the United States.{{sfn|Pycior|1997|p=208}}{{sfn|Inter-Agency Committee on Mexican American Affairs|1967|p=1}} That same year, she was recognized with a presidential medal for directing the most successful MDTA program in the United States.{{sfn|''The Lansing State Journal''|1992|p=14}}{{sfn|Unterburger|Delgado|Peck|1991|p=414}}

On June 22, 1968, Villegas married William Federico Vorhauer and the couple relocated to [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]], where her husband was completing his graduate studies.

Completing her MA in sociology in 1974, she was hired by the [[Michigan Department of Education]] as a higher education consultant and the couple relocated to [[Lansing, Michigan]].{{sfn|Unterburger|Delgado|Peck|1991|p=414}}

In 1975, after attending a statewide conference for Latina women, Vorhauer founded Mujeres Unidas de Michigan (MUM) (United Women of Michigan) as an advocacy group to support women, and was elected its chair in 1978.{{sfn|Westfall|November 14, 1978|p=21}} That same year, she was appointed by Governor [[William Milliken]] to serve on the [[Michigan Women's Commission]],{{sfn|Lewis|2017|p=86}} becoming both a member of the planning committee for the [[United Nations]]' [[International Women's Year]] program and vice-chair of the Michigan delegation to the national conference.{{sfn|Westfall|1977|p=36}} As a result of their outreach to promote Latina women to leadership roles, MUM sent six members in the delegation of forty-eight Michigan women to attend the [[1977 National Women's Conference]] in [[Houston, Texas]].{{sfn|Burns|2006|p=137}} In 1976, Vorhauer authored the ''Mason Miller Report'', an evaluation of minorities and higher education, which became the model for analyzing participation of minorities in colleges and universities throughout Michigan.{{sfn|Burns|2006|p=138}}{{sfn|Deiters|1990|p=15}}{{sfn|Frank|1992|p=8}}{{sfn|Love|2006|p=473}} The report became the basis of a bi-lingual education law passed by the Michigan state government in 1978, and garnered Vorhauer coverage as one of eleven women "Making It Happen" in the March 1978 issue of ''[[Redbook]]''.{{sfn|Westfall|March 24, 1978|p=17}}

Vorhauer had by that time lost 90% of her sight from diabetic complications. In 1980,{{sfn|Burns|2006|p=138}}{{sfn|Collier|1990|p=51}} the same year she received a Diana Award in recognition of her community service dedication,{{sfn|Douglas|1980|p=3}} she underwent surgery in hopes of restoring some of her vision.{{sfn|Burns|2006|p=138}}{{sfn|Collier|1990|p=51}} Though the surgery was unsuccessful, she returned to work as a program coordinator at the Michigan Rehabilitation Services, which assists citizens with disabilities in attaining self-sufficiency. Vorhauer traveled the state, establishing referral offices until 1988,{{sfn|Burns|2006|p=139}} when [[kidney failure]] forced her into retirement and [[Hemodialysis|dialysis]].{{sfn|Collier|1990|p=51}} Within the year, she returned to work, accepting the vacated position of the chair of the Michigan Commission for the Blind,{{sfn|Deiters|1990|p=15}}{{sfn|Burns|2006|p=140}} the first Hispanic to hold the post.{{sfn|Love|2006|p=473}} Establishing a large-print newspaper, she also founded a support group for blind Catholics to attend Mass together,{{sfn|Collier|1990|p=51}} while heading the commission and over one hundred employees.{{sfn|Burns|2006|p=140}} In 1990, Vorhauer was inducted into the [[Michigan Women's Hall of Fame]], the first Latina the organization had honored.{{sfn|Deiters|1990|p=15}}{{sfn|Frank|1992|p=8}} Soon after the recognition, she retired and moved with her husband to [[Las Cruces, New Mexico]], where her brother lived.{{sfn|Burns|2006|p=140}}

The '''domestic pigeon''' (''Columba livia domestica'') is a [[Columbidae|pigeon]] [[subspecies]] that was derived from the [[rock dove]] (also called the [[rock pigeon]]). The rock pigeon is the world's oldest [[domesticated]] bird. [[Mesopotamia]]n [[Cuneiform script|cuneiform]] tablets mention the domestication of pigeons more than 5,000 years ago, as do [[Egypt]]ian [[hieroglyph]]ics.&lt;ref name="Blechman"&gt;{{cite book| last =Blechman | first =Andrew | title =Pigeons-The fascinating saga of the world's most revered and reviled bird. | publisher =University of Queensland Press | year =2007| location =St Lucia, Queensland | url =http://andrewblechman.com/pigeons/learn_more.html| isbn =978-0-7022-3641-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Research suggests that domestication of pigeons occurred as early as 10,000 years ago.&lt;ref name="Blechman" /&gt;

Pigeons have made contributions of considerable importance to humanity, especially in times of war.&lt;ref name="Levi"&gt;{{cite book |last=Levi |first=Wendell |title= The Pigeon|year= 1977|publisher= Levi Publishing Co, Inc|location= Sumter, S.C.|isbn=0-85390-013-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In war the homing ability of pigeons has been put to use by making them messengers. So-called [[war pigeon]]s have carried many vital messages and some have been decorated for their services. Medals such as the [[Croix de guerre]], awarded to [[Cher Ami]], and the [[Dickin Medal]] awarded to the pigeons [[G.I. Joe (pigeon)|G.I. Joe]] and [[Paddy (pigeon)|Paddy]], amongst 32 others, have been awarded to pigeons for their services in saving human lives.

==Reproduction==
Domestic pigeons reproduce in a similar way to the wild [[rock pigeon#Reproduction|rock pigeon]]. Generally humans will select breeding partners. [[Crop milk]] or [[pigeon milk]] produced by both male and female parent birds may occasionally be replaced with [[Crop milk#Hand-rearing pigeon chicks|artificial substitutes]]. Pigeons are extremely protective of their eggs, and in some cases will go to severe lengths to protect their productive eggs and have been known to seek revenge on those who interfere with their productive process. Baby pigeons are called ''squeakers'' or ''squabs''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last =Gorman | first =Kate | title =Bird lady of Haslet helps to elevate occasions | publisher =Star Telegram (Jun 15, 2008) | url =http://www.star-telegram.com/407/story/700926.html | accessdate =2008-06-25 }}{{dead link|date=April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Trained domestic pigeons are able to return to the home loft if released at a location that they have never visited before and that may be up to [[1 E6 m|1000 km]] away. A special breed, called [[homing pigeon]]s has been developed through selective breeding to carry messages and members of this variety of pigeon are still being used in the sport of [[pigeon racing]] and the [[release dove|white release dove]] ceremony at weddings and funerals.

The ability a pigeon has to return home from a strange location necessitates two sorts of information. The first, called "map sense" is their geographic location. The second, "compass sense" is the bearing they need to fly from their new location in order to reach their home. Both of these senses, however, respond to a number of different cues in different situations. The most popular conception of how pigeons are able to do this is that they are able to sense the [[Earth's magnetic field]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last= Von Middendorff|first=A.|year=1859|title=Die Isepiptesen Rußlands|journal=Mémoires de l'Académie impériale des Sciences de St. Pétersbourg, VI, Ser. Tome|volume=8|pages=1–143}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Viguier|first=C.|year=1882|title= Le sens de l’orientation et ses organes chez les animaux et chez l’homme|journal= Revne Philosophique de la France et de l'Étranger|volume=14|pages=1–36}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wiltschko | first1 = W. | last2 = Wiltschko | first2 = R. | year = 1996 | title = Magnetic Orientation in Birds | url = | journal = Journal of Experimental Biology | volume = 199 | issue = | pages = 29–38 }}&lt;/ref&gt; with tiny magnetic tissues in their head ([[magnetoception]]){{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}. This is all the more surprising as they are not a [[bird migration|migratory]] species, which is a fact used by some ornithologists to dispute this theory{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}. Another theory is that pigeons have compass sense, which uses the position of the sun, along with an internal clock, to work out direction. However, studies have shown that if magnetic disruption or clock changes disrupt these senses, the pigeon can still manage to get home. The variability in the effects of manipulations to these sense of the pigeons indicates that there is more than one cue on which navigation is based and that map sense appears to rely on a comparison of available cues&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wiltschko | first1 = W. | last2 = Wiltschko | first2 = R. | year = 2003 | title = Avian navigation: from historical to modern concepts | url = | journal = Animal Behaviour | volume = 65 | issue = | pages = 257–272 | doi=10.1006/anbe.2003.2054}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other purposes of pigeon breeding==

===For food===
{{Main|Squab}}
Pigeons are also bred for meat, generally called squab and harvested from young birds. Pigeons grow to a very large size in the nest before they are [[fledge]]d and able to fly, and in this stage of their development (when they are called squabs) they are prized as food. For commercial meat production a breed of large white pigeon, named "[[King (pigeon)|King pigeon]]," has been developed by selective breeding. Breeds of pigeons developed for their meat are collectively known as [[utility pigeons]].

===Exhibition breeds===
{{Main|Fancy pigeon}}
[[Pigeon keeping|Pigeon fanciers]] developed many exotic forms of pigeon. These are generally classed as [[fancy pigeon]]s. Fanciers compete against each other at exhibitions or shows and the different forms or [[breed]]s are judged to a [[Breed standard|standard]] to decide who has the best bird. Among those breeds are the [[English carrier pigeon]]s, a variety of pigeon with [[wattle (anatomy)|wattles]] and a unique, almost vertical, stance ([https://web.archive.org/web/20071210183002/http://members.aol.com/duiven/highlight/carrier/carrier.htm pictures]). There are many ornamental breeds of pigeons, including the "Duchess" breed, which has as a prominent characteristic feet that are completely covered by a sort of fan of feathers. The [[fantail pigeon]]s are also very ornamental with their fan-shaped tail feathers.

===Flying/Sporting===
[[File:Domestic Pigeon Flock.jpg|thumb|right|Domestic pigeons in flight]]
{{Main|Flying/Sporting pigeons}}
Pigeons are also kept by enthusiasts for the enjoyment of [[Flying/Sporting pigeons|Flying/Sporting]] competitions. Breeds such as [[tippler]]s are flown in endurance contests by their owners.

==Experimentation==
Domestic pigeons are also commonly used in laboratory experiments in biology, medicine and [[cognitive science]].

===Cognitive science===
Pigeons have been trained to distinguish between [[cubism|cubist]] and [[impressionism|impressionist]] paintings, for instance. In Project Sea Hunt, a US coast guard search and rescue project in the 1970s/1980s, pigeons were shown to be more effective than humans in spotting shipwreck victims at sea.&lt;ref name=uscg&gt;{{cite web

Pigeons are able to acquire orthographic processing skills,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Damian Scarf|author2=Karoline Boy|author3=Anelisie Uber Reinert|author4=Jack Devine|author5=Onur Güntürkün|author6=Michael Colombo|title=Orthographic processing in pigeons (Columba livia)|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|date=2016|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2016/09/13/1607870113.full|access-date=24 September 2016|doi=10.1073/pnas.1607870113|pmc=5056114}}&lt;/ref&gt; which form part of the ability to read, and basic numerical skills equivalent to those shown in primates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Damian Scarf|author2=Harlene Hayne|author3=Michael Colombo|title=Pigeons on par with primates in numerical competence|journal=Science|date=2016|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/334/6063/1664|access-date=24 September 2016|doi=10.1126/science.1213357}}&lt;/ref&gt;

 | accessdate =2007-06-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In American pigeon-related organizations, some enthusiasts have openly shared their experiences of killing hawks and falcons, although this is frowned upon by the majority of fanciers. None of the major clubs condone this practice. It is estimated that almost 1,000 birds of prey have been killed in [[Oregon]] and [[Washington (state)|Washington]], and that 1,000–2,000 are killed in southern [[California]] annually. In June 2007, three Oregon men were indicted with misdemeanour violations of the [[Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918|Migratory Bird Treaty Act]] for killing birds of prey. Seven Californians and a [[Texas|Texan]] were also charged in the case.

In the [[West Midlands (region)|West Midlands]] region of the [[United Kingdom]] pigeon fanciers have been blamed for a trap campaign to kill [[peregrine falcon]]s. Eight illegal spring-loaded traps were found close to peregrine nests and at least one of the protected birds died. The steel traps are thought to have been set as part of a "concerted campaign" to kill as many of the birds as possible in the West Midlands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last =Smith | first =Lewis | title =Pigeon fanciers blamed for trap campaign to kill peregrine falcons | publisher =Times Online  | url =http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/environment/article4029413.ece | format =Online news  | accessdate =2008-06-20  | location=London | date=2008-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pigeon related illness==
[[File:Chicago pigeon in flight 2.jpg|thumb|Chicago-native ''Columba livia domestica'' in flight.]]
Pigeon breeders sometimes suffer from an ailment known as ''[[bird fancier's lung]]'' or ''pigeon lung''. A form of [[hypersensitivity pneumonitis]], ''pigeon lung'' is caused by the inhalation of the avian proteins found in feathers and dung. It can sometimes be combated by wearing a filtered mask.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Other pigeon related pathogens causing lung disease are ''[[Chlamydophila psittaci]]'' (which causes [[psittacosis]], ''[[Histoplasma capsulatum]]'' (which causes [[histoplasmosis]] and ''[[Cryptococcus neoformans]]'', which causes [[cryptococcosis]].

==Feral pigeons==
{{Main|Feral pigeon}}
[[File:WinterPigeons02.jpg|right|thumb|Feral rock pigeons commonly show a very wide range of plumage variation.]]

Many domestic birds have escaped or been released over the years, and have given rise to the [[feral]] pigeon. These show a variety of plumages, although some look very much like pure rock pigeons. The scarcity of the pure wild species is partly due to interbreeding with feral birds. Domestic pigeons can often be distinguished from feral pigeons because they usually have a metal or plastic band around one (sometimes both) legs which shows, by a number on it, that they are registered to an owner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last =Porter | first =Cynthya | title =Goodview man finds racing pigeon | publisher =Winona Post | url =http://www.winonapost.com/stock/functions/VDG_Pub/detail.php?choice=25710&amp;home_page=1&amp;archives= | accessdate =2008-07-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legal provisions ==
The main rights granted by the DRL are (1) the right to distribute Dominion Rules, (2) the right to modify Dominion Rules, (3) the rights to create and distribute "Larger Works" and "Compatible Works".

The main right licensees grant under the DRL is the right of others to copy, modify and distribute any modifications to Dominion Rules a licensee makes.

These provisions resemble those found in many [[Open-source license|open-source licences]].

== Versions ==
Version 1.1 of the DRL is the most prominent previous version. It was under this version of the DRL that [[Dominion Rules]] 2.0 was released in 2002.

The current version of the DRL is 2.0. It closely resembles version 1.1 but has been simplified in some respects. DRL v. 2.0 is the version under which [[Dominion Rules]] 3.0 was released in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;See http://www.dominionrules.org&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7864">In [[abstract algebra]], the '''endomorphism ring''' of an [[abelian group]] ''X'', denoted by End(''X''), is the set of all [[endomorphism]]s of ''X'' (i.e., the set of all [[homomorphism]]s of ''X'' into itself) endowed with an addition operation defined by [[Pointwise#Pointwise operations|pointwise]] addition of [[Function (mathematics)|functions]] and a multiplication operation defined by [[function composition]]. Using these operations, the set of endomorphisms of an abelian group forms a (unital) [[Ring (mathematics)|ring]], with the [[zero map]] as [[additive identity]] and the [[identity map]] as   [[multiplicative identity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Fraleigh|1976|p=211}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Passman|1991|pp=4–5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The functions involved are restricted to what is defined as a homomorphism in the context, which depends upon the [[category (mathematics)|category]] of the object under consideration. The endomorphism ring consequently encodes several internal properties of the object. As the resulting object is often an [[algebra (ring theory)|algebra]] over some ring ''R,'' this may also be called the '''endomorphism algebra'''.

==Description==
Let {{nowrap|(''A'', +)}} be an abelian group and we consider the group homomorphisms from ''A'' into ''A''. Then addition of two such homomorphisms may be defined pointwise to produce another group homomorphism. Explicitly, given two such homomorphisms ''f'' and ''g'', the sum of ''f'' and ''g'' is the homomorphism {{nowrap|1=(''f'' + ''g'')(''x'') := ''f''(''x'') + ''g''(''x'')}}. Under this operation End(''A'') is an abelian group. With the additional operation of composition of homomorphisms, End(''A'') is a ring with multiplicative identity. This composition is explicitly {{nowrap|1=(''fg'')(''x'') := ''f''(''g''(''x''))}}. The multiplicative identity is the identity homomorphism on ''A''.

If the set ''A'' does not form an ''abelian'' group, then the above construction is not necessarily [[Additive map|additive]], as then the sum of two homomorphisms need not be a homomorphism.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Dummit|Foote|p=347}}&lt;/ref&gt; This set of endomorphisms is a canonical example of a [[near-ring]] that is not a ring.

== Properties ==
* Endomorphism rings always have additive and multiplicative [[identity element|identities]], respectively the [[zero map]] and [[identity function|identity map]].
* Endomorphism rings are [[associative]], but typically [[non-commutative ring|non-commutative]].
* If a module is [[simple module|simple]], then its endomorphism ring is a [[division ring]] (this is sometimes called [[Schur's lemma]]).{{sfn|Jacobson| 2009|loc=p. 118}}
* A module is [[indecomposable module|indecomposable]] if and only if its endomorphism ring does not contain any non-trivial [[idempotent element (ring theory)|idempotent element]]s.{{sfn|Jacobson|2009|loc=p. 111, Prop. 3.1}} If the module is an [[injective module]], then indecomposability is equivalent to the endomorphism ring being a [[local ring]].{{sfn|Wisbauer|1991|loc=p.163}}
* For a [[semisimple module]], the endomorphism ring is a [[von Neumann regular ring]].
* The endomorphism ring of a nonzero right [[uniserial module]] has either one or two maximal right ideals. If the module is Artinian, Noetherian, projective or injective, then the endomorphism ring has a unique maximal ideal, so that it is a local ring.
* The endomorphism ring of an Artinian [[uniform module]] is a local ring.{{sfn|Wisbauer|1991|loc=p. 263}}
* The endomorphism ring of a module with finite [[composition length]] is a [[semiprimary ring]].
* The endomorphism ring of a [[continuous module]] or [[discrete module]] is a [[clean ring]].{{sfn|Camillo|Khurana|Lam|Nicholson|2006}}
* If an ''R'' module is finitely generated and projective (that is, a [[progenerator]]), then the endomorphism ring of the module and ''R'' share all Morita invariant properties. A fundamental result of Morita theory is that all rings equivalent to ''R'' arise as endomorphism rings of progenerators.

== Examples ==
* In the category of ''R'' [[module (mathematics)|module]]s the endomorphism ring of an ''R''-module ''M'' will only use the ''R'' [[module homomorphism]]s, which are typically a proper subset of the abelian group homomorphisms.&lt;ref&gt;Abelian groups may also be viewed as modules over the ring of integers.&lt;/ref&gt; When ''M'' is a [[finitely generated module|finitely generated]] [[projective module]], the endomorphism ring is central to [[Morita equivalence]] of module categories.
* For any abelian group &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;M_n(\operatorname{End}(A))\cong \operatorname{End}(A^n)&lt;/math&gt;, since any matrix in &lt;math&gt;M_n(\operatorname{End}(A))&lt;/math&gt; carries a natural homomorphism structure of &lt;math&gt;A^n&lt;/math&gt; as follows: 
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix}\phi_{11}&amp;\cdots &amp;\phi_{1n}\\ \vdots&amp; &amp;\vdots \\ \phi_{n1}&amp;\cdots&amp; \phi_{nn}  \end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix}a_1\\\vdots\\a_n\end{pmatrix}=\begin{pmatrix}\sum_{i=1}^n\phi_{1i}(a_i)\\\vdots\\\sum_{i=1}^n\phi_{ni}(a_i) \end{pmatrix} &lt;/math&gt;. 
:One can use this isomorphism to construct a lot of non-commutative endomorphism rings. For example: &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{End}(\mathbb{Z}\times \mathbb{Z})\cong M_2(\mathbb{Z})&lt;/math&gt;, since &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{End}(\mathbb{Z})\cong \mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt;.  
:Also, when &lt;math&gt;R=K&lt;/math&gt; is a field, there is a canonical isomorphism &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{End}(K)\cong K&lt;/math&gt;, so &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{End}(K^n)\cong M_n(K)&lt;/math&gt;, that is, the endomorphism ring of a &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt;-vector space is identified with the [[matrix ring|ring of ''n''-by-''n'' matrices]] with entries in &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt;.{{sfn|Drozd|Kirichenko|1994|loc=pp. 23–31}} More generally, the endomorphism algebra of the [[free module]] &lt;math&gt;M = R^n&lt;/math&gt; is naturally &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-by-&lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; matrices with entries in the ring &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;.
*As a particular example of the last point, for any ring ''R'' with unity, {{nowrap|1=End(''R''&lt;sub&gt;''R''&lt;/sub&gt;) = ''R''}}, where the elements of ''R'' act on ''R'' by ''left'' multiplication.
*In general, endomorphism rings can be defined for the objects of any [[preadditive category]].

==History==
In Eugenics there is a focus on women as the bearers of the future “race.” In [[Francis Galton|Galton]]'s original formulation of eugenics women were seen as a mere conduit to pass "genius" from father to son, however as the movement progressed there was increasing importance placed on women as “mothers of the race”.  The emphasis of women in eugenics led eventually to eugenicist [[Caleb Saleeby]] (1878-1940) coining the term “'''eugenic feminism'''” in ''Woman and Womanhood: A Search for Principles''&lt;ref name="Saleeby"/&gt;&lt;ref name="wsuffrage"&gt;{{cite web |title=Woman suffrage, eugenics, and eugenic feminism in Canada «  Women Suffrage and Beyond |url=http://womensuffrage.org/?p=22106 |website=womensuffrage.org |accessdate=27 October 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170428163310/http://womensuffrage.org/?p=22106 |archive-date=2017-04-28 |dead-url=no |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Saleeby disagreeing with some [[sexist]] eugenic principles, in light of new research on heredity at the time notes that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
If it were true that woman is merely the vessel and custodian of the future lives of men and women, entrusted to her antenatal care by their fathers, as many creeds have supposed, then indeed it would be a question of relatively small moment how the mothers of the future were chosen.[...]

But directly we observe, under the microscope, the facts of development, we discover that each
parent contributes an exactly equal share to the making of the new individual, and all the ancient and modern ideas of the superior value of well-selected fatherhood fall to the ground. Woman is indeed half the race.[...]

And thus it matters for the future at least as much how the mothers are chosen as how the fathers are.[...]
Woman is half the race; and the leaders of the woman's movement must recognize the importance of their sex in this fundamental question of eugenics.

There is possible no Eugenic Feminism which shall satisfy those whose simple argument is that woman must have what she wants, just as man must.[...]

No one will question that the position and happiness and self-realization of women in the modern world would be vastly enhanced by the reforms for which I plead, though some men will not think that game worth the candle.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

At the turn of the 20th century as the [[Women's Suffrage]] movement began, and eugenic feminists used eugenics in the argument for being granted the right to vote.  They argued that not only must their social conditions be ameliorated in order to improve the human race, but also that they must be given power as women’s moral superiority toward social space made them uniquely suited to cleaning up corruption.&lt;ref name="wsuffrage"/&gt; Devereux characterizes Saleeby's invention of "Eugenic Feminism" as "at least partly a deceptive rhetorical strategy" whose goal was to "draw middle-class women's rights activists ''back'' to home and duty".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Devereux |first=Cecily |title=Growing a Race: Nellie L. McClung and the Fiction of Eugenic Feminism |publisher=[[McGill-Queen's University Press]] |year=2006 |isbn=9780773573048 |oclc=243600906}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Different versions of eugenic feminism arose between 1890 and 1930, but each shared in the argument that the eugenic decline of the race could be prevented only if women were granted greater political, social, sexual, and economic equality.

In the 1930s eugenic feminism began to decline as eugenic feminists began to fall out with mainstream eugenicists, and had largely failed to sway the public opinion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ziegler |first1=Mary |title=Eugenic Feminism: Mental Hygiene, the Women's Movement, and the Campaign for Eugenic Legal Reform, 1900-1935 |journal=Harvard Journal of Law and Gender |date=2008 |volume=31 |page=211 |language=en |quote=Several different visions of eugenic feminism were articulated between 1890 and 1930, but each found commonality in the argument that the eugenic decline of the race could be prevented only if women were granted greater political, social, sexual, and economic equality. This argument correlated gender equality with racial improvement: eugenic science and law had to guarantee some form of substantive gender equality in order to improve the race.  Thus, in the years between 1915 and 1935, eugenic feminism existed distinct from, and in increasing tension with, mainstream eugenic science and policy. Ultimately, leading eugenic feminists could neither change the minds of a majority of the eugenic coalition nor resolve the contradictions inherent in their own eugenic theories. While they often argued that their reforms should be supported primarily as means to achieve a eugenic end, each leader held on to the very kinds of rights and equality-based arguments that mainstream eugenicists rejected. This contradiction contributed significantly to the decline and disappearance of eugenic feminism in the early and mid-1930s.|ssrn=1646393 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Canada==
In Canada, all members of the suffragist group known as the "[[The Famous Five (Canada)|Famous Five]]" were known to support eugenics,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Feminism |url=http://eugenicsarchive.ca/discover/tree/52336b0a5c2ec50000000049 |website=The Eugenics Archives |accessdate=31 October 2018 |language=en |quote=All of the Famous Five were also involved in the race hygiene movement and supported the passage of the Sexual Sterilization Act of Alberta}}&lt;/ref&gt; including [[Emily Murphy]] and [[Nellie McClung]], the latter notably supporting the [[Sexual_Sterilization_Act_of_Alberta|1928 Sexual Sterilization Act of Alberta]] and the [[Compulsory_sterilization_in_Canada#British_Columbia|1933 Sexual Sterilization Act of British Columbia]].&lt;ref name="eu-arch"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Rosario |first1=Esther |title=Feminism |url=http://eugenicsarchive.ca/discover/tree/52336b0a5c2ec50000000049 |website=The Eugenics Archives |accessdate=27 October 2018 |language=en |date=2013-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In the United Kingdom==
&lt;blockquote&gt;British eugenicists such as [[Caleb Saleeby]], [[Karl Pearson]], and [[Havelock Ellis]], held that women were essentially reproductive agents.[...] Proponents of mainstream eugenics and some early advocates of women’s rights found common ground. Not all early feminists supported eugenic practices, but the notion of social advancement as intricately tied to reproduction was central to both eugenicists and early feminists.[...] Some suffragists advocated for staunch immigration policies and eugenic practices such as mental hygiene and the social segregation and sexual sterilization of the “feeble-minded.”&lt;ref name="eu-arch"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the United Kingdom [[Marie Stopes]] an early feminist, founded the first birth control clinic in the UK in 1921. Stopes was opposed to abortion and contraception, preferring that "unfit" children were not conceived in the first place.  In 1920 Stopes wrote “I would legislate compulsory sterilization of the insane, feeble minded… revolutionaries… half castes”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Eugenics and Feminism - A Brief History |url=http://dangerouswomenproject.org/2017/02/28/eugenics-and-feminism/ |website=Dangerous Women Project |accessdate=27 October 2018 |date=28 February 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180322223322/http://dangerouswomenproject.org/2017/02/28/eugenics-and-feminism/ |archive-date=2018-03-22 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In the United States==
{{see| Eugenics in the United States#Planned Parenthood and the African American community}}
In the United states some feminists advocated for legal reform involving some aspects of eugenics, notably ''The National Federation of Women's Clubs'', the [[Woman's Christian Temperance Union]], and the [[National League of Women Voters]] had at some point lobbied for eugenic legislation.&lt;ref name=Ziegler&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ziegler|first=Mary|title=Eugenic Feminism: Mental Hygiene, The Women's Movement, And The Campaign For Eugenic Legal Reform, 1900–1935|journal=Harvard Journal of Law &amp; Gender|year=2008|volume=31|issue=1|pages=211–236}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One of the most prominent feminists to push for eugenics was [[Margaret Sanger]], the leader of the American [[birth control]] movement.&lt;ref name=nyu&gt;[http://www.nyu.edu/projects/sanger/secure/newsletter/articles/sanger-hitler_equation.html "The Sanger-Hitler Equation"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110921080638/http://www.nyu.edu/projects/sanger/secure/newsletter/articles/sanger-hitler_equation.html |date=2011-09-21 }}, ''[[Margaret Sanger Papers Project]] Newsletter'', #32, Winter 2002/3.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5170">'''Feminist Hulk''' ('''@feministhulk''') is a parody [[Twitter]] account written from the perspective of a [[feminism|feminist]] incarnation of the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]], a [[Marvel Comics]] superhero with boundless rage and strength but a limited vocabulary.  Feminist Hulk incorporates [[feminist theory]] into tweets, notably threatening to smash the [[patriarchy]] and [[gender binary]]. Blogger Christopher Shea observed that part of the humor "comes from hearing feminist theory spouted by such a [[hypermasculinity|hypermasculine]] figure."&lt;ref name="Shea"/&gt;

==Overview==
The Feminist Hulk Twitter profile reads "HULK SAYS FUCK PATRIARCHY. HULK SMASH GENDER BINARY."&lt;ref name="NPR"/&gt; The Twitter [[Avatar (computing)|avatar]] for Feminist Hulk is an image of the Marvel Comics superhero holding a copy of philosopher and gender theorist [[Judith Butler]]'s book ''[[Gender Trouble]]''.&lt;ref name="Salon"/&gt; Feminist Hulk tweets in [[all caps]], but makes an exception for feminist author [[bell hooks]], tweeting "HULK MAKE CAPITALIZATION EXCEPTION FOR bell hooks. HULK LOVE HER ESSAY ON [[Madonna (entertainer)|MADONNA]] AND RACIST [[Cultural appropriation|APPROPRIATION]]".&lt;ref name="Salon"/&gt;

==History==
Feminist Hulk started tweeting on May 11, 2010, quickly followed by the online magazine ''[[Salon (website)|Salon]]''.&lt;ref name="Salon"&gt;{{cite news|last=Traister|first=Rebecca|title=FEMINIST HULK MAKE TWITTER FUN!|url=http://www.salon.com/2010/05/18/feminist_hulk/|newspaper=Salon|date=May 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; By June 2010, the account had gained over 15,000 followers&lt;ref name="Shea"&gt;{{cite web|last=Shea|first=Christopher|title=FEMINIST HULK SMASH SEXISM|url=http://www.boston.com/bostonglobe/ideas/brainiac/2010/06/whats_big_green.html|website=Brainiac|publisher=Boston.com|date=June 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and had been interviewed on ''[[Ms. (magazine)|Ms.]]'' magazine&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bilger|first=Audrey|title=FEMINIST HULK SMASH EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW WITH MS.!|url=http://msmagazine.com/blog/2010/06/07/feminist-hulk-smash-exclusive-interview-with-ms/|newspaper=Ms.|date=June 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Feministing blogs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Feministing Five: Feminist Hulk|url=http://feministing.com/2011/07/09/the-feministing-five-feminist-hulk/|newspaper=Feministing|date=July 9, 2011|first=Chloe|last=Angyal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2011, Feminist Hulk garnered over 40,000 followers and was included in [[Amanda Palmer]]'s "Most Amusing Tweets of the Year" song.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bilger|first=Audrey|title=FEMINIST HULK MEET MS.

She described herself as a "[[White people|white]], [[vegan]], [[queer]], [[The Woman-Identified Woman|woman-identified female]]."&lt;ref name="Ms3"&gt;{{cite news|last=Bilger|first=Audrey|title=Who’s Behind the Mask of Feminist Hulk?

By 2013, Feminist Hulk had 74,000 followers on Twitter.&lt;ref name="Huffpo"/&gt;

===WIC/Formula Resource Project===
In the wake of the [[United States federal government shutdown of 2013]], insufficient funding disrupted some [[WIC]] food and nutrition programs. Lawson, herself a single mother, set up the website feministhulk.net, using the site as a directory for women who need to find resources during the shutdown and for people who would like to make donations.&lt;ref name="Huffpo"&gt;{{cite news|last=Belkin|first=Lisa|title=Where To Find Formula And Baby Food During A WIC Shutdown|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/10/07/where-to-find-formula-baby-food-wic-shutdown_n_4059616.html|newspaper=Huffington Post|date=October 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The site includes links to lists of [[food bank]]s and a state-by-state guide to resources for [[infant formula]] and updates on the status of WIC.&lt;ref name="NPR"&gt;{{cite news|last=Woodsome|first=Kate|title=Feminist Hulk Smash Shutdown, Rescue Women On Food Aid!|url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/thesalt/2013/10/12/232306911/feminist-hulk-smash-shutdown-rescue-women-on-food-aid|newspaper=NPR|date=October 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2778">In [[abstract algebra]], the '''[[fundamental theorem]] on homomorphisms''', also known as the '''fundamental homomorphism theorem''', relates the structure of two objects between which a [[homomorphism]] is given, and of the [[Kernel (algebra)|kernel]] and image of the homomorphism.

The homomorphism theorem is used to prove the [[isomorphism theorem]]s.

== Group theoretic version ==

Given two [[group (mathematics)|group]]s ''G'' and ''H'' and a [[group homomorphism]] ''f'' : ''G''→''H'',  let ''K'' be a [[normal subgroup]] in ''G'' and φ the natural [[surjective]] homomorphism ''G''→''G''/''K'' (where ''G''/''K'' is a [[quotient group]]). If ''K'' is a subset of [[kernel (algebra)|ker]](''f'') then there exists a unique homomorphism ''h'':''G''/''K''→''H'' such that ''f'' = ''h'' φ.

In other words, the natural projection φ is [[Universal property|universal]] among homomorphisms on ''G'' that map ''K'' to the identity element.

The situation is described by the following [[commutative diagram]]:

[[File:Fundamental Homomorphism Theorem.svg]]

By setting ''K'' = ker(''f'') we immediately get the [[first isomorphism theorem]].

== Other versions ==
Similar theorems are valid for [[monoid]]s, [[vector space]]s, [[module (mathematics)|modules]], and [[ring (mathematics)|rings]].

'''Generative systems''' are technologies with the overall capacity to produce unprompted change driven by large, varied, and uncoordinated audiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Zittrain|first=Jonathan |last2= |first2= |date= May 2006|title=The Generative Internet |jstor= 4093608 |journal= Harvard Law Review|publisher= |volume= |issue= |pages= |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt; When generative systems provide a common platform, changes may occur at varying layers (physical, network, application, content) and provide a means through which different firms and individuals may cooperate indirectly and contribute to innovation.&lt;ref name="TeiglandPower2013"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Robin Teigland|author2=Dominic Power|title=The Immersive Internet: Reflections on the Entangling of the Virtual with Society, Politics and the Economy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T5mx4Ei2cHwC&amp;pg=PA204|date=25 March 2013|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=978-1-137-28302-3|pages=205}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Depending on the rules, the patterns can be extremely varied and unpredictable.  One of the more well-known examples is [[Conway's Game of Life]], a [[cellular automaton]]. Another example is [[Boids]]. More examples can be found in [[generative music]], [[generative art]], and, more recently, in video games such as [[Spore (2008 video game)|Spore]].

[[Image:Heliocentric.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Andreas Cellarius|Andreas Cellarius's]] illustration of the Copernican system, from the ''Harmonia Macrocosmica'' (1708).]]

'''Heliocentrism'''{{efn|Optionally capitalised, ''Heliocentrism'' or ''heliocentrism'', according to [[#soed|The Shorter Oxford English Dictionary (6th ed., 2007)]]. The term is a learned formation based on   [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|[[wikt:ἥλιος|ἥλιος]]}} ''[[Helios]]'' "Sun" and {{lang|grc|[[wikt:κέντρον|κέντρον]]}} ''kentron'' "center"; the adjective ''heliocentric'' is first recorded in English (as ''heliocentrick'') in 1685, after [[New Latin]] ''heliocentricus'', in use from about the same time ([[Johann Jakob Zimmermann]], ''Prodromus biceps cono ellipticæ et a priori demonstratæ planetarum theorices'', 1679, p. 28). 
The abstract noun in ''[[-ism]]'' is more recent, recorded from the late 19th century (e.g. in Constance Naden, ''Induction and Deduction: A Historical and Critical Sketch of Successive Philosophical Conceptions Respecting the Relations Between Inductive and Deductive Thought and Other Essays'' (1890), p. 76: "Copernicus started from the observed motions of the planets, on which astronomers were agreed, and worked them out on the new hypothesis of Heliocentrism"), modelled after German ''Heliocentrismus'' or ''Heliozentrismus'' (c. 1870).}} is the [[astronomy|astronomical]] model in which the [[Earth]] and planets revolve around the [[Sun]] at the center of the [[Solar System]]. Historically, heliocentrism was opposed to [[Geocentric model|geocentrism]], which placed the Earth at the center. The notion that the Earth revolves around the Sun had been proposed as early as the 3rd century BC by [[Aristarchus of Samos]],&lt;ref&gt;[[#CITEREFDreyer1953|Dreyer (1953)]], [https://archive.org/stream/historyofplaneta00dreyuoft#page/n148/mode/2up pp.135–48]; [[#CiTEREFLinton2004|Linton (2004)]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=B4br4XJFj0MC&amp;pg=PA38 pp.38–9)].  The work of Aristarchus's in which he proposed his heliocentric system has not survived.  We only know of it now from a brief passage in [[Archimedes]]'s ''[[The Sand Reckoner]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; but at least in the medieval world, Aristarchus's heliocentrism attracted little attention—possibly because of the loss of scientific works of the Hellenistic Era.&lt;ref&gt;according to [[Lucio Russo]], the heliocentric view was expounded in [[Hipparchus]]'s work on gravity.

It was not until the 16th century that a [[mathematical model]] of a heliocentric system was presented, by the [[Renaissance]]&lt;!-- do not add a nationality claim --&gt; mathematician, astronomer, and Catholic cleric [[Nicolaus Copernicus]], leading to the [[Copernican Revolution]]. In the following century, [[Johannes Kepler]] introduced [[Elliptic orbit|elliptical orbits]], and [[Galileo Galilei]] presented supporting observations made using a [[telescope]].

With the observations of [[William Herschel]], [[Friedrich Bessel]], and other astronomers, it was realized that the sun, while near the [[barycenter]] of the solar system, was not at any center of the universe.

==Ancient and medieval astronomy==
[[Image:geoz wb en.svg|thumb|250px|A hypothetical geocentric model of the solar system (upper panel) in comparison to the heliocentric model (lower panel).]]
While the [[sphericity of the Earth]] was widely recognized in Greco-Roman astronomy from at least the 3rd century BC, the Earth's [[Earth's rotation|daily rotation]] and [[Earth's orbit|yearly orbit around the Sun]] was never universally accepted until the [[Copernican Revolution]].

While a moving Earth was proposed at least from the 4th century BC in [[Pythagoreanism]], and a fully developed heliocentric model was developed by [[Aristarchus of Samos]] in the 3rd century BC, these ideas were not successful in replacing the view of a static spherical Earth, and from the 2nd century AD the predominant model, which would be inherited by medieval astronomy, was the [[Ptolemaic system|geocentric model]] described in [[Ptolemy]]'s ''[[Almagest]]''.

The Ptolemaic system was a sophisticated astronomical system that managed to calculate the positions for the planets to a fair degree of accuracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

&lt;/ref&gt; 
Ptolemy himself, in his ''[[Almagest]]'', points out that any model for describing the motions of the planets is merely a mathematical device, and since there is no actual way to know which is true, the simplest model that gets the right numbers should be used.&lt;ref&gt;
In Book 1 section 7 he admits that a model in which the earth revolves with respect to the stars would be simpler but doesn't go as far as considering a heliocentric system.&lt;/ref&gt;
However, he rejected the idea of a [[Earth rotation|spinning earth]] as absurd as he believed it would create huge winds. His [[Ptolemy#Astronomy|planetary hypotheses]] were sufficiently real that the distances of moon, sun, planets and stars could be determined by treating orbits' [[Celestial spheres#Antiquity|celestial spheres]] as contiguous realities. This made the stars' distance less than 20 [[Astronomical Units]],&lt;ref&gt;Dennis Duke, [http://people.scs.fsu.edu/~dduke/ptolemy.html Ptolemy's Universe]&lt;/ref&gt; a regression, since [[Aristarchus of Samos]]'s heliocentric scheme had centuries earlier [[#Classical Antiquity|necessarily]] placed the stars at least two orders of magnitude more distant.

Problems with Ptolemy's system were well recognized in medieval astronomy, and an increasing effort to criticize and improve it in the late medieval period eventually led to the [[Copernican heliocentrism]] developed in Renaissance astronomy.

===Classical Antiquity===

====Pythagoreans====
The non-geocentric model of the [[Universe]] was proposed by the [[Pythagoreans|Pythagorean]] philosopher [[Philolaus]] (d. 390 BC), who taught that at the center of the Universe was a "central fire", around which the [[Earth]], [[Sun]], [[Moon]] and [[planets]] revolved in uniform circular motion.  This system postulated the existence of a counter-earth collinear with the Earth and central fire, with the same period of revolution around the central fire as the Earth.  The Sun revolved around the central fire once a year, and the stars were stationary.  The Earth maintained the same hidden face towards the central fire, rendering both it and the "counter-earth" invisible from Earth.  The Pythagorean concept of uniform circular motion remained unchallenged for approximately the next 2000 years, and it was to the Pythagoreans that Copernicus referred to show that the notion of a moving Earth was neither new nor revolutionary.&lt;ref&gt;Boyer, C. ''A History of Mathematics.'' Wiley, p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt; Kepler gave an alternative explanation of the Pythagoreans' "central fire" as the Sun, "as most sects purposely hid[e] their teachings".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|author=Johannes Kepler|title=Epitome of Copernican Astronomy, Book IV, Part 1.2|year=1618–21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Heraclides Ponticus|Heraclides of Pontus]] (4th century BC) said that the [[Earth's rotation|rotation of the Earth]] explained the apparent daily motion of the celestial sphere. It used to be thought that he believed [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] and [[Venus]] to revolve around the Sun, which in turn (along with the other planets) revolves around the Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| volume = 23| issue = 4| page = 233| last = Eastwood| first = B.

====Aristarchus of Samos====
[[Image:Aristarchus working.jpg|thumb|right|[[Aristarchus of Samos|Aristarchus's]] 3rd century BC calculations on the relative sizes of the Earth, Sun and Moon, from a 10th-century AD Greek copy]]

The first person known to have proposed a heliocentric system, however, was [[Aristarchus of Samos]] (''c''. 270 BC). Like [[Eratosthenes]], Aristarchus calculated the size of the Earth, and measured the [[On the Sizes and Distances (Aristarchus)|sizes and distances of the Sun and Moon]]. From his estimates, he concluded that the Sun was six to seven times wider than the Earth, and thought the larger object would have the most attractive force.

His writings on the heliocentric system are lost, but some information about them is known from a brief description by his contemporary, [[Archimedes]], and from scattered references by later writers. Archimedes' description of Aristarchus's theory is given in the former's book, ''[[The Sand Reckoner]]''. The entire description comprises just three sentences, which [[Thomas Little Heath|Thomas Heath]] translates as follows:&lt;ref&gt;Heath ([[#CITEREFHeath1913|1913]], p.[https://archive.org/stream/aristarchusofsam00heatuoft#page/302/mode/2up 302]). The italics and parenthetical comments are as they appear in Heath's original.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!--- This is a verbatim quotation of Heath's text.  As such, it should preserve the spelling—of such words as "centre", — which he actually used.--&gt;
{{quote|You are aware ['you' being King Gelon] that "universe" is the name given by most astronomers to the sphere, the centre of which is the centre of the earth, while its radius is equal to the straight line between the centre of the sun and the centre of the earth.  This is the common account (τά γραφόμενα), as you have heard from astronomers.  But Aristarchus brought out ''a book consisting of certain hypotheses'', wherein it appears, as a consequence of the assumptions made, that the universe is many times greater than the "universe" just mentioned. His hypotheses are that ''the fixed stars and the sun remain unmoved, that the earth revolves about the sun on the circumference of a circle, the sun lying in the middle of the orbit'', and that the sphere of the fixed stars, situated about the same centre as the sun, is so great that the circle in which he supposes the earth to revolve bears such a proportion to the distance of the fixed stars as the centre of the sphere bears to its surface.|''[[The Sand Reckoner]]'' (''Arenarius'' I, 4-7)}}

Aristarchus presumably took the stars to be very far away because he was aware that their [[parallax#Stellar parallax|parallax]]&lt;ref&gt;That is, an apparent movement of the stars relative to the [[celestial pole]]s and [[celestial equator|equator]], and to each other, caused by the Earth's revolution around the Sun.&lt;/ref&gt; would otherwise be observed over the course of a year. The stars are in fact so far away that stellar parallax only became detectable when sufficiently powerful [[telescope]]s had been developed.

No references to Aristarchus's heliocentrism are known in any other writings from before the [[common era]].  The earliest of the handful of other ancient references occur in two passages from the writings of [[Plutarch]].  These mention one detail not stated explicitly in Archimedes's account—&lt;ref&gt;Although it could obviously be reasonably inferred therefrom.&lt;/ref&gt; namely, that Aristarchus's theory had the Earth rotating on an axis. The first of these reference occurs in ''On the Face in the Orb of the Moon'':&lt;ref&gt;Heath ([[#CITEREFHeath1913|1913]], p.[https://archive.org/stream/aristarchusofsam00heatuoft#page/304/mode/2up 304]). Most modern scholars share Heath's opinion that it is Cleanthes in this passage who is being held as having accused Aristarchus of impiety (see Gent &amp; Godwin [[#CITEREFPlutarch1883|1883]], p.[https://archive.org/stream/plutarchsmorals51883plut#page/240/mode/2up 240]; Dreyer [[#CITEREFDreyer1953|1906]], p.[https://archive.org/stream/historyofplaneta00dreyuoft#page/138/mode/1up 138]; Prickard, [[#CITEREFPlutarch1911|1911]], p.[https://archive.org/stream/plutarchonfacewh00plut#page/20/mode/1up 20]; Cherniss [[#CITEREFPlutarch1957|1957]], p.[https://archive.org/stream/moraliainfifteen12plutuoft#page/54/mode/2up 55]; for example). The manuscripts of Plutarch's ''On the Face in the Orb of the Moon'' that have come down to us are corrupted, however, and the traditional interpretation of the passage has been challenged by [[Lucio Russo]], who insists that it should be interpreted as having Aristarchus rhetorically suggest that ''Cleanthes'' was being impious for wanting to shift the ''Sun'' from its proper place at the center of the universe (Russo, [[#CITEREFRusso2013|
2013]], p.[https://books.google.com/books?id=ld8lBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA82 82]; Russo &amp; Medaglia, [[#CITEREFRussoMedaglia1996|1996]], pp.113-7).&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|Only do not, my good fellow, enter an action against me for impiety in the style of [[Cleanthes]], who thought it was the duty of Greeks to indict Aristarchus of Samos on the charge of impiety for putting in motion the Hearth of the Universe, this being the effect of his attempt to save the phenomena by supposing the heaven to remain at rest and the earth to revolve in an oblique circle, while it rotates, at the same time, about its own axis.|''On the Face in the Orb of the Moon'' (''De facie in orbe lunae'', c. 6, pp. 922 F - 923 A.) }}
Only scattered fragments of Cleanthes's writings have survived in quotations by other writers, but in ''[[Lives and Opinions of Eminent Philosophers]]'', [[Diogenes Laertius]] lists ''A reply to Aristarchus'' (Πρὸς Ἀρίσταρχον) as one of Cleanthes's works,&lt;ref&gt;Hicks ([[#CITEREFDiogenes Laertius1972|1972]], Bk 7, ch 5, p.[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0258:book=7:chapter=5&amp;highlight=aristarchus 281])&lt;/ref&gt; and some scholars&lt;ref&gt;Edwards ([[#CITEREFEdwards1998|1998]], p.[https://books.google.com.au/books?id=nS51_7qbEWsC&amp;pg=PA68 68] and n.104, p.[https://books.google.com.au/books?id=nS51_7qbEWsC&amp;pg=PA455 455]), for instance.&lt;/ref&gt; have suggested that this might have been where Cleanthes had accused Aristarchus of impiety.

The second of the references by Plutarch is in his ''Platonic Questions'':&lt;ref name="archive.org"&gt;Heath ([[#CITEREFHeath1913|1913]], p.[https://archive.org/stream/aristarchusofsam00heatuoft#page/305/mode/2up 305]).&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Did Plato put the earth in motion, as he did the sun, the moon, and the five planets, which he called the instruments of time on account of their turnings, and was it necessary to conceive that the earth "which is globed about the axis stretched from pole to pole through the whole universe" was not represented as being held together and at rest, but as turning and revolving (στρεφομένην καὶ ἀνειλουμένην), as Aristarchus and [[Seleucus of Seleucia|Seleucus]] afterwards maintained that it did, the former stating this as only a hypothesis (ὑποτιθέμενος μόνον), the latter as a definite opinion (καὶ ἀποφαινόμενος) ?| ''Platonic Questions'' (''Platonicae Quaestiones'' viii. I, 1006 C)}}
The remaining references to Aristarchus's heliocentrism are extremely brief, and provide no more information beyond what can be gleaned from those already cited. Ones which mention Aristarchus explicitly by name occur in [[Aetius (philosopher)|Aëtius]]'s ''Opinions of the Philosophers'', [[Sextus Empiricus]]'s ''Against the Mathematicians'',&lt;ref name="archive.org"/&gt; and an anonymous scholiast to Aristotle.&lt;ref&gt;Dreyer ([[#CITEREFDreyer1953|1906]], p.[https://archive.org/stream/historyofplaneta00dreyuoft#page/139/mode/1up 139])&lt;/ref&gt; Another passage in Aëtius's ''Opinions of the Philosophers'' reports that Seleucus the astronomer had affirmed the Earth's motion, but does not mention Aristarchus.&lt;ref name="archive.org"/&gt;

====Seleucus of Seleucia====

Since [[Plutarch]] mentions the "followers of Aristarchus" in passing, it is likely that there were other astronomers in the Classical period who also espoused heliocentrism, but whose work was lost. The only other astronomer from antiquity known by name who is known to have supported Aristarchus' heliocentric model was [[Seleucus of Seleucia]] (b. 190 BC), a [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic]] astronomer who flourished a century after Aristarchus in the [[Seleucid empire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last1=Murdin|first1=Paul|editor1-last=Murdin|editor1-first=Paul |title=Seleucus of Seleucia (c. 190 BC-?) |journal=Encyclopedia of Astronomy and Astrophysics|pages=3998|doi=10.1888/0333750888 |isbn=978-0-333-75088-9 | bibcode=2000eaa..bookE3998.|year=2000|citeseerx=10.1.1.255.9251}}&lt;/ref&gt; Seleucus was a proponent of the heliocentric system of Aristarchus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ics.forth.gr/~vsiris/ancient_greeks/hellinistic_period.html|title=Index of Ancient Greek Philosophers-Scientists|website=Ics.forth.gr|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180127034924/http://users.ics.forth.gr/~vsiris/ancient_greeks/hellinistic_period.html|archivedate=January 27, 2018|accessdate=20 November 2018|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Seleucus may have proved the heliocentric theory by determining the constants of a [[geometry|geometric]] model for the heliocentric theory and developing methods to compute planetary positions using this model.

Alternatively, his explanation may have involved the phenomenon of [[tide]]s,&lt;ref&gt;[[Lucio Russo]], ''Flussi e riflussi'', Feltrinelli, Milano, 2003, {{ISBN|88-07-10349-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; which he supposedly theorized to be caused by the attraction to the [[Moon]] and by the revolution of the [[Earth]] around the Earth and Moon's [[Barycenter|center of mass]].

====Late Antiquity====
There were occasional speculations about heliocentrism in Europe before Copernicus. In [[Carthage#Roman Carthage|Roman Carthage]], the [[pagan]] [[Martianus Capella]] (5th century A.D.) expressed the opinion that the planets Venus and Mercury did not go about the Earth but instead circled the Sun.&lt;ref&gt;William Stahl, trans., ''Martianus Capella and the Seven Liberal Arts'', vol. 2, ''The Marriage of Philology and Mercury'', 854, 857, New York: Columbia Univ.

The Ptolemaic system was also received in [[Indian astronomy]].
[[Aryabhata]] (476–550), in his magnum opus ''[[Aryabhatiya]]'' (499), propounded a planetary model in which the Earth was taken to be [[Earth's rotation|spinning on its axis]] and the periods of the planets were given with respect to the Sun.{{sfn|Thurston|1994|p=188}} He also made many astronomical calculations, such as the times of the [[solar eclipse|solar]] and [[lunar eclipse|lunar]] [[eclipse]]s, and the instantaneous motion of the Moon.{{sfn|Joseph|2000|pp=393–4, 408}} Early followers of Aryabhata's model included [[Varahamihira]], [[Brahmagupta]], and [[Bhaskara II]].

Al-Biruni discussed the possibility of whether the Earth rotated about its own axis and orbited the Sun, but in his ''Masudic Canon'' (1031),&lt;ref name="Covington 2007"&gt;{{cite web|last=Covington|first=Richard|title=Rediscovering Arabic Science|url=http://archive.aramcoworld.com/issue/200703/rediscovering.arabic.science.htm|website=Aramco World|accessdate=20 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; he expressed his faith in a geocentric and stationary Earth.&lt;ref&gt;E.

In the 12th century, non-heliocentric alternatives to the Ptolemaic system were developed by some Islamic astronomers, such as [[Nur ad-Din al-Bitruji]], who considered the Ptolemaic model mathematical, and not physical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|editor=Thomas Hockey|last=Samsó|first=Julio|title=Biṭrūjī: Nūr al‐Dīn Abū Isḥāq &amp;#91;Abū Jaʿfar&amp;#93; Ibrāhīm ibn Yūsuf al‐Biṭrūjī|encyclopedia=The Biographical Encyclopedia of Astronomers|publisher=Springer|year=2007|location=New York|pages=133–4|url=http://islamsci.mcgill.ca/RASI/BEA/Bitruji_BEA.htm|isbn=978-0-387-31022-0|ref=harv|display-editors=etal}} ([http://islamsci.mcgill.ca/RASI/BEA/Bitruji_BEA.pdf PDF version])&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=DSB /&gt; His system spread throughout most of Europe in the 13th century, with debates and refutations of his ideas continued to the 16th century.&lt;ref name=DSB&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Samsó|first=Julio|title=Al-Bitruji Al-Ishbili, Abu Ishaq|encyclopedia=[[Dictionary of Scientific Biography]]| publisher=Charles Scribner's Sons|location=New York|year=1970–80|isbn=978-0-684-10114-9|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G2-2830904829.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Maragheh observatory|Maragha]] school of astronomy in [[Ilkhanid]]-era Persia further developed "non-Ptolemaic" planetary models involving [[Earth's rotation]].

The observations of the Maragha school were further improved at the Timurid-era [[Ulugh Beg Observatory|Samarkand observatory]] under [[Ali Qushji|Qushji]] (1403–1474).

===Later medieval period===
[[Image:Nicholas of Cusa.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Nicholas of Cusa]], 15th century, asked whether there was any reason to assert that any point was the center of the universe.]]
European scholarship in the later medieval period actively received astronomical models developed in the Islamic world and by the 13th century was well aware of the problems of the Ptolemaic model. In the 14th century, bishop [[Nicole Oresme]] discussed the possibility that the Earth rotated on its axis, while Cardinal [[Nicholas of Cusa]] in his ''[[De Docta Ignorantia|Learned Ignorance]]'' asked whether there was any reason to assert that the Sun (or any other point) was the center of the universe.  In parallel to a mystical definition of God, Cusa wrote that "Thus the fabric of the world (''machina mundi'') will ''quasi'' have its center everywhere and circumference nowhere,"&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas of Cusa, ''De docta ignorantia'', 2.12, p. 103, cited in Koyré (1957), p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; recalling [[Hermes Trismegistus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ritmanlibrary.com/founder/god-is-an-infinite-sphere/|title=Favourite quote of founder Joost R.

In India, [[Nilakantha Somayaji]] (1444–1544), in his ''Aryabhatiyabhasya'', a commentary on Aryabhata's ''Aryabhatiya'', developed a computational system for a geo-heliocentric planetary model, in which the planets orbit the Sun, which in turn orbits the Earth, similar to the [[Tychonic system|system later proposed]] by [[Tycho Brahe]]. In the ''[[Tantrasamgraha]]'' (1501), Somayaji further revised his planetary system, which was mathematically more accurate at predicting the heliocentric orbits of the interior planets than both the Tychonic and [[Copernican heliocentrism|Copernican models]],{{sfn|Joseph|2000}}&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Model of planetary motion in the works of Kerala astronomers|last=Ramasubramanian|first=K.|journal=Bulletin of the Astronomical Society of India|volume=26|pages=11–31 [23–4]|bibcode=1998BASI...26...11R|year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; but did not propose any specific models of the universe.&lt;ref&gt;K.

==Renaissance-era astronomy==

Some historians maintain that the thought of the [[Maragheh observatory]], in particular the mathematical devices known as the [[Urdi lemma]] and the [[Tusi couple]],  influenced Renaissance-era European astronomy, and thus was indirectly received by Renaissance-era European astronomy and thus by [[Copernicus]].&lt;ref name="Saliba"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Roberts | first1 = V. | last2 = Kennedy | first2 = E.

The state of knowledge on planetary theory received by Copernicus is summarized in [[Georg von Peuerbach]]'s ''Theoricae Novae Planetarum'' (printed in 1472 by [[Regiomontanus]]). By 1470, the accuracy of observations by the Vienna school of astronomy, of which Peuerbach and Regiomontanus were members, was high enough to make the eventual development of heliocentrism inevitable, and indeed it is possible that Regiomontanus did arrive at an explicit theory of heliocentrism before his death in 1476, some 30 years before Copernicus.&lt;ref&gt;[[Arthur Koestler]], ''The Sleepwalkers'', Penguin Books, 1959, p. 212.&lt;/ref&gt;
While the influence of the criticism of Ptolemy by Averroes on Renaissance thought is clear and explicit, the claim of direct influence of the 
Maragha school, postulated by [[Otto E. Neugebauer]] in 1957, remains an open question.&lt;ref name="Huff" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;N.K. Singh, M.

It has been argued that Copernicus could have independently discovered the Tusi couple or took the idea from [[Proclus]]'s ''Commentary on the First Book of [[Euclid's Elements|Euclid]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Veselovsky | first1 = I.

===Copernican heliocentrism===
{{Main|Copernican heliocentrism}}

[[File:Kopernikus, Nikolaus - Reußner 1578 Portrait1.jpg|thumb|150px|Portrait of [[Nicolaus Copernicus]] (1578){{efn|The image shows a woodcut by Christoph Murer, from Nicolaus Reusner's ''Icones'' (printed 1578), allegedly after a (lost) self-portrait by Copernicus himself; the Murer portrait became the template for a number of later (17th century) woodcuts, copper engravings and paintings of Copernicus.}}]]
[[Nicolaus Copernicus]] in his ''[[De revolutionibus orbium coelestium]]'' ("On the revolution of heavenly spheres", first printed in 1543 in Nuremberg), presented a discussion of a heliocentric model of the universe in much the same way as [[Ptolemy]] in the 2nd century had presented his geocentric model in his ''[[Almagest]]''.
Copernicus discussed the philosophical implications of his proposed system, elaborated it in geometrical detail, used selected astronomical observations to derive the parameters of his model, and wrote astronomical tables which enabled one to compute the past and future positions of the stars and planets.  In doing so, Copernicus moved heliocentrism from philosophical speculation to predictive geometrical astronomy. In reality, Copernicus's system did not predict the planets' positions any better than the Ptolemaic system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Henry|first=John|title=Moving heaven and earth : Copernicus and the solar system|date=2001|publisher=Icon|location=Cambridge|isbn=978-1-84046-251-7|page=87}}&lt;/ref&gt; This theory resolved the issue of planetary [[retrograde motion]] by arguing that such motion was only perceived and apparent, rather than [[reality|real]]: it was a [[parallax]] effect, as an object that one is passing seems to move backwards against the horizon. This issue was also resolved in the geocentric [[Tychonic system]]; the latter, however, while eliminating the major [[epicycle]]s, retained as a physical reality the irregular back-and-forth motion of the planets, which Kepler characterized as a "[[pretzel]]".&lt;ref&gt;Gingerich, ([[#CITEREFGingerich2004|2004, p. 51]])&lt;/ref&gt;

Copernicus cited Aristarchus in an early (unpublished) manuscript of ''De Revolutionibus'' (which still survives), stating: "Philolaus believed in the mobility of the earth, and some even say that Aristarchus of Samos was of that opinion."&lt;ref&gt;Gingerich, O. "Did Copernicus Owe a Debt to Aristarchus?" Journal for the History of Astronomy, Vol.16, NO.1/FEB, P. 37, 1985.  As mentioned earlier in this article, Philolaus had the Earth moving round a Central Fire which was not the Sun, so Copernicus's reference to Aristarchus's model as possibly geodynamic does not necessarily imply that he thought it was heliocentric.&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the published version he restricts himself to noting that in works by [[Cicero]] he had found an account of the theories of [[Hicetas]] and that [[Plutarch]] had provided him with an account of the [[Pythagoreans]], [[Heraclides Ponticus]], [[Philolaus]], and [[Ecphantus]]. These authors had proposed a moving earth, which did not, however, revolve around a central sun.

==Reception in Early Modern Europe==
{{main|Copernican Revolution}}

===Circulation of Commentariolus (before 1515)===
The first information about the heliocentric views of [[Nicolaus Copernicus]] was circulated in manuscript completed some time before May 1, 1514.&lt;ref&gt;A library catalogue of a 16th-century historian, Matthew of Miechow, bears that date and contains a reference to the manuscript,  so it must have begun circulating before that date (Koyré, [[#CITEREFKoyré1973|1973, p.85]]; Gingerich, [[#CITEREFGingerich2004|2004, p.32]]).&lt;/ref&gt;  Although only in manuscript, Copernicus' ideas were well known among astronomers and others. His ideas contradicted the then-prevailing understanding of the Bible. In the [[King James Bible]] (first published in 1611), First Chronicles 16:30 states that "the world also shall be stable, that it be not moved." Psalm 104:5 says, "[the Lord] Who laid the foundations of the earth, that it should not be removed for ever." Ecclesiastes 1:5 states that "The sun also ariseth, and the sun goeth down, and hasteth to his place where he arose."

Nonetheless, in 1533, [[Johann Albrecht Widmannstetter]] delivered in Rome a series of lectures outlining Copernicus' theory. The lectures were heard with interest by [[Pope Clement VII]] and several Catholic [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinals]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#CITEREFSpeller2008|Speller]] (2008, [https://books.google.com/books?id=jviElHq-kEcC&amp;pg=PA51 p.51])&lt;/ref&gt; On November 1, 1536, [[Archbishop of Capua]] [[Nikolaus von Schönberg]] wrote a letter to Copernicus from Rome encouraging him to publish a full version of his theory.

However, in 1539, [[Martin Luther]] said:

{{quote|"There is talk of a new astrologer who wants to prove that the earth moves and goes around instead of the sky, the sun, the moon, just as if somebody were moving in a carriage or ship might hold that he was sitting still and at rest while the earth and the trees walked and moved. But that is how things are nowadays: when a man wishes to be clever he must . . . invent something special, and the way he does it must needs be the best! The fool wants to turn the whole art of astronomy upside-down. However, as Holy Scripture tells us, so did Joshua bid the sun to stand still and not the earth."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.astronomy.ohio-state.edu/~pogge/Ast161/Unit3/response.html|title=Religious Objections to Copernicus|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This was reported in the context of a conversation at the dinner table and not a formal statement of faith. [[Melanchthon]], however, opposed the doctrine over a period of years.&lt;ref&gt;Melanchthon, Elements of Physics, 1st. edition, 1549&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Revolution in Science, I. Bernard Cohen, page 497.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Publication of de Revolutionibus (1543)===
[[Nicolaus Copernicus]] published the definitive statement of his system in [[De Revolutionibus Orbium Coelestium|''De Revolutionibus'']] in 1543. Copernicus began to write it in 1506 and finished it in 1530, but did not publish it until the year of his death. Although he was in good standing with the Church and had dedicated the book to [[Pope Paul III]], the published form contained an unsigned preface by [[Andreas Osiander|Osiander]] defending the system and arguing that it was useful for computation even if its hypotheses were not necessarily true. Possibly because of that preface, the work of Copernicus inspired very little debate on whether it might be [[heresy|heretical]] during the next 60 years. There was an early suggestion among [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]] that the teaching of heliocentrism should be banned, but nothing came of it at the time.

Some years after the publication of ''De Revolutionibus'' [[John Calvin]] preached a sermon in which he denounced those who "pervert the order of nature" by saying that "the sun does not move and that it is the earth that revolves and that it turns".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Rosen-1995|Rosen (1995, p.159).]] Rosen disputes the earlier conclusion of another scholar that this was referring specifically to Copernicus's theory.  According to Rosen, Calvin had very likely never heard of Copernicus and was referring instead to "the traditional geokinetic cosmology".&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, Calvin is ''not'' responsible for another famous quotation which has often been misattributed to him: "Who will venture to place the authority of Copernicus above that of the Holy Spirit?" It has long been established that this line cannot be found in any of Calvin's works.&lt;ref&gt;Rosen, Edward (1960), ''Calvin’s attitude toward Copernicus'' in ''Journal of the History of Ideas'', volume 21, no. 3, July, pp.431–441. Reprinted in [[#Reference-Rosen-1995|Rosen (1995, pp.161–171)]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gingerich, Owen (2004), ''The Book Nobody Read''. New York: Walker and Co.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hooykaas, R.

===Tycho Brahe's geo-heliocentric system (c. 1587)===
{{main|Tychonic system}}
[[Image:Tychonian system.svg|thumb|In this depiction of the Tychonic system, the objects on blue orbits (the Moon and the Sun) revolve around the Earth. The objects on orange orbits (Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn) revolve around the Sun. Around all is a sphere of fixed stars, located just beyond Saturn.]]

Prior to the publication of ''De Revolutionibus'', the most widely accepted system had been proposed by [[Ptolemy]], in which the [[Earth]] was the center of the universe and all celestial bodies orbited it. [[Tycho Brahe]], arguably the most accomplished astronomer of his time, advocated against Copernicus's heliocentric system and for an alternative to the Ptolemaic geocentric system:  a geo-heliocentric system now known as the [[Tychonic system]] in which the five then known planets orbit the sun, while the sun and the moon orbit the earth.

Tycho appreciated the Copernican system, but objected to the idea of a moving Earth on the basis of physics, astronomy, and religion. The [[Aristotelian physics]] of the time (modern Newtonian physics was still a century away) offered no physical explanation for the motion of a massive body like Earth, whereas it could easily explain the motion of heavenly bodies by postulating that they were made of a different sort substance called [[Aether (classical element)|aether]] that moved naturally.  So Tycho said that the Copernican system "... expertly and completely circumvents all that is superfluous or discordant in the system of Ptolemy. On no point does it offend the principle of mathematics. Yet it ascribes to the Earth, that hulking, lazy body, unfit for motion, a motion as quick as that of the aethereal torches, and a triple motion at that."&lt;ref&gt;Owen Gingerich, ''The eye of heaven: Ptolemy, Copernicus, Kepler'', New York: American Institute of Physics, 1993, 181, {{ISBN|0-88318-863-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, Tycho took issue with the vast distances to the stars that Aristarchus and Copernicus had assumed in order to explain the lack of any visible parallax. Tycho had measured the apparent sizes of stars (now known to be illusory – see stellar [[Magnitude (astronomy)|magnitude]]), and used geometry to calculate that in order to both have those apparent sizes and be as far away as heliocentrism required, stars would have to be huge (much larger than the sun; the size of Earth's orbit or larger). Regarding this Tycho wrote, "Deduce these things geometrically if you like, and you will see how many absurdities (not to mention others) accompany this assumption [of the motion of the earth] by inference."&lt;ref&gt;Blair, Ann, "Tycho Brahe's critique of Copernicus and the Copernican system", ''Journal of the History of Ideas'', 51, 1990, 364.&lt;/ref&gt;  He also cited the Copernican system's "opposition to the authority of Sacred Scripture in more than one place" as a reason why one might wish to reject it, and observed that his own geo-heliocentric alternative "offended neither the principles of physics nor Holy Scripture".&lt;ref&gt;Gingerich, O. &amp; Voelkel, J. R., [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1998JHA....29....1G# ''J. Hist. Astron.'', Vol. 29, 1998], page 1, 24&lt;/ref&gt;

The Jesuit astronomers in Rome were at first unreceptive to Tycho's system; the most prominent, [[Christopher Clavius|Clavius]], commented that Tycho was "confusing all of astronomy, because he wants to have [[Mars]] lower than the Sun."&lt;ref&gt;Fantoli, 2003, p.&amp;nbsp;109&lt;/ref&gt; However, after the advent of the telescope showed problems with some geocentric models (by demonstrating that Venus circles the sun, for example), the Tychonic system and variations on that system became very popular among geocentrists, and the Jesuit astronomer [[Giovanni Battista Riccioli]] would continue Tycho's use of physics, stellar astronomy (now with a telescope), and religion to argue against heliocentrism and for Tycho's system well into the seventeenth century (see [[Giovanni Battista Riccioli|Riccioli]]).

===Galileo Galilei and 1616 ban against Copernicanism===
{{main|Galileo affair}}
[[Image:Galileo.arp.300pix.jpg|thumb|right|In the 17th century AD [[Galileo Galilei]] opposed the Roman Catholic Church by his strong support for heliocentrism]]Galileo was able to look at the night sky with the newly invented telescope. He published his discoveries that the Sun rotated and that Venus exhibited a full range of phases in his ''[[Letters on Sunspots]]'' (1613). These discoveries were not consistent with the Ptolemeic model of the Solar System. As the Jesuit astronomers confirmed Galileo's observations, the Jesuits moved toward Tycho's teachings.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Koestler, The Sleepwalkers (Penguin Arkana, 1989 p. 433)&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 1615 "[[Letter to the Grand Duchess Christina]]", Galileo defended heliocentrism, and claimed it was not contrary to Holy Scripture. He took [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]]'s position on Scripture: not to take every passage literally when the scripture in question is in a Bible book of poetry and songs, not a book of instructions or history. The writers of the Scripture wrote from the perspective of the terrestrial world, and from that vantage point the sun does rise and set. In fact, it is the Earth's rotation which gives the impression of the sun in motion across the sky.

In February 1615, prominent Dominicans including Thomaso Caccini and Niccolò Lorini brought Galileo's writings on heliocentrism to the attention of the Inquisition, because they appeared to violate Holy Scripture and the decrees of the [[Council of Trent]].&lt;ref name="Langford 1992, p.56-57"&gt;Langford (1992), p.56-57&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Drake-1978|Drake (1978, p.240)]], [[#Reference-Sharratt-1994|Sharratt (1994, pp.110−111)]], [[#Reference-Favaro-1890|Favaro]] [http://moro.imss.fi.it/lettura/LetturaWEB.DLL?VOL=19&amp;VOLPAG=297 (1907, 19:297−298)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208071722/http://moro.imss.fi.it/lettura/LetturaWEB.DLL?VOL=19&amp;VOLPAG=297 |date=December 8, 2015 }} {{it icon}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Cardinal and Inquisitor [[Robert Bellarmine]] was called upon to adjudicate, and wrote in April that treating heliocentrism as a real phenomenon would be "a very dangerous thing," irritating philosophers and theologians, and harming "the Holy Faith by rendering Holy Scripture as false."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Sharratt-1994|Sharratt (1994, pp.110−115)]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1616 Msgr. [[Francesco Ingoli]] addressed an essay to Galileo disputing the Copernican system. Galileo later stated that he believed this essay to have been instrumental in the ban against Copernicanism that followed in February.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Graney-2015|Graney (2015, pp. 68-69)]] Ingoli's essay was published in English translation for the first time in 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Maurice Finocchiaro, Ingoli had probably been commissioned by the Inquisition to write an expert opinion on the controversy, and the essay provided the "chief direct basis" for the ban.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Finocchiaro-2010|Finocchiaro (2010, pp. 72)]]&lt;/ref&gt; The essay focused on eighteen physical and mathematical arguments against heliocentrism.  It borrowed primarily from the arguments of Tycho Brahe, and it notedly mentioned the problem that heliocentrism requires the stars to be much larger than the sun.  Ingoli wrote that the great distance to the stars in the heliocentric theory "clearly proves ... the fixed stars to be of such size, as they may surpass or equal the size of the orbit circle of the Earth itself."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Graney-2015|Graney (2015, pp. 71)]]&lt;/ref&gt;  Ingoli included four theological arguments in the essay, but suggested to Galileo that he focus on the physical and mathematical arguments. Galileo did not write a response to Ingoli until 1624.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Graney-2015|Graney (2015, pp. 66-76, 164-175, 187-195)]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 1616, the Inquisition assembled a committee of theologians, known as qualifiers, who delivered their unanimous report condemning heliocentrism as "foolish and absurd in philosophy, and formally heretical since it explicitly contradicts in many places the sense of Holy Scripture." The Inquisition also determined that the Earth's motion "receives the same judgement in philosophy and ... in regard to theological truth it is at least erroneous in faith."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Favaro-1890|Favaro]] [http://moro.imss.fi.it/lettura/LetturaWEB.DLL?VOL=19&amp;VOLPAG=320 (1907, 19:320)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160513100630/http://moro.imss.fi.it/lettura/LetturaWEB.DLL?VOL=19&amp;VOLPAG=320 |date=May 13, 2016 }}, [http://esmateria.com/2014/02/28/una-errata-reproducida-durante-siglos-cambia-la-censura-de-la-iglesia-a-galileo/ Domínguez (2014)]; [https://arxiv.org/abs/1402.6168 arXiv:1402.6168 Original text of the decision]&lt;/ref&gt; Bellarmine personally ordered Galileo

{{quote|"to abstain completely from teaching or defending this doctrine and opinion or from discussing it... to abandon completely... the opinion that the sun stands still at the center of the world and the earth moves, and henceforth not to hold, teach, or defend it in any way whatever, either orally or in writing."|Bellarmine and the Inquisition's injunction against Galileo, 1616&lt;ref name="Heilbron 2010, p.218"&gt;Heilbron (2010), p.218&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In March, after the Inquisition's injunction against Galileo, the papal [[Theologian of the Pontifical Household|Master of the Sacred Palace]], [[Congregation of the Index]], and Pope banned all books and letters advocating the Copernican system, which they called "the false Pythagorean doctrine, altogether contrary to Holy Scripture."&lt;ref name="Heilbron 2010, p.218"/&gt;&lt;ref name=retrying&gt;{{cite book|last=Finochiario|first=Maurice|title=Retrying Galileo|date=2007|publisher=University of California Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1618 the Holy Office recommended that a modified version of Copernicus' ''De Revolutionibus'' be allowed for use in calendric calculations, though the original publication remained forbidden until 1758.&lt;ref name=retrying /&gt;

In ''[[Astronomia nova]]'' (1609), [[Johannes Kepler]] had used an elliptical orbit to explain the motion of Mars. In ''[[Epitome astronomiae Copernicanae]]'' (1617–1621) he developed a heliocentric model of the Solar System in which all the planets have elliptical orbits. This provided significantly increased accuracy in predicting the position of the planets. Kepler's ideas were not immediately accepted. Galileo for example completely ignored Kepler's work. Kepler proposed heliocentrism as a physical description of the Solar System and ''Epitome astronomia Copernicanae'' was placed on the index of prohibited books despite Kepler being a Protestant.

[[Pope Urban VIII]] encouraged Galileo to publish the pros and cons of heliocentrism. Galileo's response, ''[[Dialogue concerning the two chief world systems]]'' (1632), clearly advocated heliocentrism, despite his declaration in the preface that,

&lt;blockquote&gt;
I will endeavour to show that all experiments that can be made upon the Earth are insufficient means to conclude for its mobility but are indifferently applicable to the Earth, movable or immovable...&lt;ref name="Salusbury"&gt;''[[q:The Systeme of the World: in Four Dialogues|The Systeme of the World: in Four Dialogues]]'' (1661) Thomas Salusbury translation of ''Dialogo sopra i Due Massi Sistemi del Mondo'' (1632)&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

and his straightforward statement,
&lt;blockquote&gt;
I might very rationally put it in dispute, whether there be any such centre in nature, or no; being that neither you nor any one else hath ever proved, whether the World be finite and figurate, or else infinite and interminate; yet nevertheless granting you, for the present, that it is finite, and of a terminate Spherical Figure, and that thereupon it hath its centre...&lt;ref name="Salusbury"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Some ecclesiastics also interpreted the book as characterizing the Pope as a simpleton, since his viewpoint in the dialogue was advocated by the character [[Simplicius of Cilicia|Simplicio]]. Urban VIII became hostile to Galileo and he was again summoned to Rome.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Koestler, ''The Sleepwalkers'' (Penguin Arkana, 1989 p. 491)&lt;/ref&gt; Galileo's trial in 1633 involved making fine distinctions between "teaching" and "holding and defending as true". For advancing heliocentric theory Galileo was forced to recant Copernicanism and was put under house arrest for the last few years of his life.

According to J. L. Heilbron, informed contemporaries of Galileo's "appreciated that the reference to heresy in connection with Galileo or Copernicus had no general or theological significance."&lt;ref&gt;Heilbron ([[#CITEREFHeilbron1999|1999]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=mZWy0xPxj3EC&amp;pg=PA203&amp;#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p.203])&lt;/ref&gt;

===Age of Reason===
{{see|Age of Reason|17th-century philosophy|Scientific revolution}}
[[René Descartes]] postponed, and ultimately never finished, his treatise ''[[The World (Descartes)|The World]]'', which included a heliocentric model,&lt;ref name=Weintraub&gt;Weintraub, David A. ''Is Pluto a Planet'', p. 66, Princeton University Press, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; but the Galileo affair did little to slow the spread of heliocentrism across Europe, as Kepler's ''Epitome of Copernican Astronomy'' became increasingly influential in the coming decades.&lt;ref&gt;"Kepler's Laws of Planetary Motion: 1609–1666", J. L. Russell, British Journal for the History of Science, Vol. 2, No. 1, June 1964&lt;/ref&gt;  By 1686 the model was well enough established that the general public was reading about it in ''[[Conversations on the Plurality of Worlds]]'', published in France by [[Bernard le Bovier de Fontenelle]] and translated into English and other languages in the coming years.  It has been called "one of the first great popularizations of science."&lt;ref name=Weintraub /&gt;

In 1687, [[Isaac Newton]] published ''[[Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica]]'', which provided an explanation for Kepler's laws in terms of [[universal gravitation]] and what came to be known as [[Newton's laws of motion]]. This placed heliocentrism on a firm theoretical foundation, although Newton's heliocentrism was of a somewhat modern kind. Already in the mid-1680s he recognized the "deviation of the Sun" from the centre of gravity of the solar system.&lt;ref&gt;Curtis Wilson, "The Newtonian achievement in astronomy", pages 233–274 in [[#Reference-Taton&amp;Wilson-1989|R Taton &amp; C Wilson (eds) (1989)]], ''The General History of Astronomy'', Volume 2A, [https://books.google.com/books?id=rkQKU-wfPYMC&amp;pg=PA233 at page 233]&lt;/ref&gt; For Newton it was not precisely the centre of the Sun or any other body that could be considered at rest, but "the common centre of gravity of the Earth, the Sun and all the Planets is to be esteem'd the Centre of the World", and this centre of gravity "either is at rest or moves uniformly forward in a right line". Newton adopted the "at rest" alternative in view of common consent that the centre, wherever it was, was at rest.&lt;ref name=newt-hc&gt;(text quotations from 1729 translation of Newton ''Principia'', Book 3 (1729 vol.2) [https://books.google.com/books?id=6EqxPav3vIsC&amp;pg=PA233 at pages 232–233]).&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, the Church remained opposed to heliocentrism as a literal description, but this did not by any means imply opposition to all astronomy; indeed, it needed observational data to maintain its calendar. In support of this effort it allowed the cathedrals themselves to be used as solar observatories called ''[[Sundial#Meridian lines|meridiane]]''; i.e., they were turned into "reverse [[sundial]]s", or gigantic [[pinhole camera]]s, where the Sun's image was projected from a hole in a window in the cathedral's lantern onto a meridian line.

In 1664, [[Pope Alexander VII]] published his ''[[Index Librorum Prohibitorum]] Alexandri VII Pontificis Maximi jussu editus'' (Index of Prohibited Books, published by order of Alexander VII, [[Pontifex Maximus|P.M.]]) which included all previous condemnations of heliocentric books.&lt;ref&gt;"The Pontifical Decrees Against the Doctrine of the Earth's Movement, and the Ultramontane Defence of Them", Rev. William Roberts, 1885, London&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mid-eighteenth century the Church's opposition began to fade.  An annotated copy of Newton's ''Principia'' was published in 1742 by Fathers le Seur and Jacquier of the Franciscan Minims, two Catholic mathematicians, with a preface stating that the author's work assumed heliocentrism and could not be explained without the theory. In 1758 the Catholic Church dropped the general prohibition of books advocating heliocentrism from the ''[[Index Librorum Prohibitorum|Index of Forbidden Books]]''.&lt;ref&gt;John L.Heilbron, ''Censorship of Astronomy in Italy after Galileo'' (in McMullin, Ernan ed., ''The Church and Galileo'', 
University of Notre Dame Press, Notre Dame, 2005, p. 307, IN. {{ISBN|0-268-03483-4}})&lt;/ref&gt; 
The Observatory of the [[Roman College]] was established by [[Pope Clement XIV]] in 1774 (nationalized in 1878, but re-founded by   [[Pope Leo XIII]] as the [[Vatican Observatory]] in 1891). 
In spite of dropping its active resistance to heliocentrism, the Catholic Church did not lift the prohibition of uncensored versions of Copernicus's ''De Revolutionibus'' or Galileo's ''Dialogue''. The affair was revived in 1820, when the Master of the Sacred Palace (the Church's chief censor), [[Filippo Anfossi]], refused to license a book by a Catholic canon, Giuseppe Settele, because it openly treated heliocentrism as a physical fact.&lt;ref name="Heilbron 2005, pp.279, 312"&gt;[[#Reference-Heilbron-2005|Heilbron (2005, pp.279, 312–313)]]&lt;/ref&gt; Settele appealed to pope [[Pius VII]].  After the matter had been reconsidered by the Congregation of the Index and the Holy Office, Anfossi's decision was overturned.&lt;ref name="Heilbron 2005, pp.279, 312"/&gt; Pius VII approved a decree in 1822 by the [[Sacred Congregation of the Inquisition]] to allow the printing of heliocentric books in Rome. 
Copernicus's ''De Revolutionibus'' and Galileo's ''Dialogue'' were then subsequently omitted from the next edition of the ''Index'' when it appeared in 1835.

===Reception in Judaism===
Already in the [[Talmud]], Greek philosophy and science under general name "Greek wisdom" were considered dangerous. They were put under ban then and later for some periods. &lt;!--For example, in 13-5{{huh}} a ''[[Beth din|beit din]]'' (rabbinical court) in Barcelona forbade men younger than 25 from studying secular [[philosophy]] or the [[natural sciences]] (although an exception was made for those who studied medicine).{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} Possibly due to this the system of [[Nicolaus Copernicus]] did not cause furious resistance, although it was found to be contradicting verses of [[Tanakh]] (Jewish Bible).--&gt;

The first Jewish scholar to describe the Copernican system, albeit without mentioning Copernicus by name,  was [[Judah Loew ben Bezalel|Maharal of Prague]],  his book "Be'er ha-Golah" (1593). Maharal makes an argument of [[radical skepticism]], arguing that no scientific theory can be reliable, which he illustrates by the new-fangled theory of heliocentrism upsetting even the most fundamental views on the cosmos.&lt;ref name="efron"&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/3653968 Noah J. Efron. Jewish Thought and Scientific Discovery in Early Modern Europe.] Journal of the History of Ideas, Vol. 58, No. 4 (Oct., 1997), pp. 719–732&lt;/ref&gt;

Copernicus is mentioned in the books of [[David Gans]] (1541–1613), who worked with Tycho Brahe and [[Johannes Kepler]]. Gans wrote two books on astronomy in Hebrew: a short one "Magen David" (1612) and a full one "Nehmad veNaim" (published only in 1743). He described objectively three systems: [[Ptolemy]], [[Nicolaus Copernicus|Copernicus]] and of Tycho Brahe without taking sides.
[[Joseph Solomon Delmedigo]] (1591–1655) in his "Elim" (1629) says that the arguments of Copernicus are so strong, that only an imbecile will not accept them.&lt;ref&gt;Sefer Elim, Amsterdam, 1629, стр. 304&lt;/ref&gt; Delmedigo studied at [[Padua]] and was acquainted with [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]].&lt;ref name="neher"&gt;[[#CITEREFNeher1977|Neher (1977)]].&lt;/ref&gt;

An actual controversy on the Copernican model within Judaism arises only in the early 18th century. Most authors in this period accept Copernican heliocentrism, with opposition from   [[David Nieto]] and [[Tobias Cohn]].  Both of these authors argued against heliocentrism on grounds of contradictions to scripture. Nieto merely rejected the new system on those grounds without much passion, whereas Cohn went so far as to call Copernicus "a first-born of Satan", though he also acknowledged&lt;ref&gt;In a marginal note in his ''Massé Touvia'' (part 2, p.52b): "Remark of the author: I fear that the incredulous may draw an objection from a text of ''Midrash Bereshit Rabba'' (V,8) in which our Teachers, the Rabbis, of blessed memory, explain that if the Earth is called in Hebrew "''eretz''" it is because it hastens ("''ratseta''") before the Creator in order to accomplish His will. I acknowledge that the answer to this objection seems difficult for me to find", as translated by Neher ([[#CITEREFNeher1977|1977, p.220]]).&lt;/ref&gt; that he would have found it difficult to counter one particular objection based on a passage from the Talmud.

In the 19th century two students of the [[Moses Sofer|Hatam sofer]] wrote books that were given approbations by him even though one supported heliocentrism and the other geocentrism. The one, a commentary on Genesis ''Yafe’ah le-Ketz''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=32691&amp;st=&amp;pgnum=13&amp;hilite=|title=יפח לקץ - חלק א - שלזינגר, ישראל דוד (page 13 of 134)|website=www.hebrewbooks.org|access-date=2017-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; written by R.

Since the 20th century most Jews have not questioned the science of heliocentrism. Exceptions include [[Shlomo Benizri]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/808316428|title=New heavens and a new earth : the Jewish reception of Copernican thought|last=1964-|first=Brown, Jeremy,|date=2013|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=|isbn=9780199754793|location=Oxford|pages=262|oclc=808316428}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Menachem Mendel Schneerson|R. M.M. Schneerson]] of [[Chabad]] who argued that the question of heliocentrism vs. geocentrism is obsolete because of the [[Relative velocity|relativity of motion]].&lt;ref&gt;"on the basis of the presently accepted scientific view (in accordance with the theory of Relativity) that where two bodies in space are in motion relative to one another, it is impossible scientifically to ascertain which revolves around which, or which is stationary and the other in motion. Therefore, to say that there is, or can be, 'scientific proof' that the earth revolves around the sun is quite an unscientific and uncritical statement."{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}{{year needed|date=April 2017}}

&lt;!--this use of "theory of relativity" is unclear, as [[Galilean invariance]] is enough for the argument made, the speed of light doesn't enter into it. --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Schneerson's followers in Chabad continue to deny the heliocentric model.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/808316428|title=New heavens and a new earth : the Jewish reception of Copernican thought|last=1964-|first=Brown, Jeremy,|date=2013|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=|isbn=9780199754793|location=Oxford|pages=362|oclc=808316428}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The view of modern science==
[[Kepler's laws of planetary motion]] were used as arguments {{Citation needed|date=April 2012}} in favor of the heliocentric hypothesis. Three apparent proofs of the heliocentric hypothesis were provided in 1727 by [[James Bradley]], in 1838 by [[Friedrich Wilhelm Bessel]] and in 1851 by [[Leon Foucault|Foucault]]. Bradley discovered the stellar aberration, proving the relative motion of the earth. Bessel proved that the [[Stellar parallax|parallax]] of a star was greater than zero by measuring the parallax of 0.314 [[arcseconds]] of a star named [[61 Cygni]]. In the same year [[Friedrich Georg Wilhelm Struve]] and [[Thomas James Henderson|Thomas Henderson]] measured the parallaxes of other stars, [[Vega]] and [[Alpha Centauri]].

The thinking that the heliocentric view was also not true in a strict sense was achieved in steps. That the Sun was not the center of the universe, but one of innumerable stars, was strongly advocated by the mystic [[Giordano Bruno]]. Over the course of the 18th and 19th centuries, the status of the Sun as merely one star among many became increasingly obvious.  By the 20th century, even before the discovery that there are many galaxies, it was no longer an issue.

The concept of an absolute velocity, including being "at rest" as a particular case, is ruled out by the [[principle of relativity]], also eliminating any obvious "center" of the universe as a natural origin of coordinates. Some forms of [[Mach's principle]] consider the frame at rest with respect to the distant masses in the universe to have special properties.

Even if the discussion is limited to the [[solar system]], the Sun is not at the geometric center of any planet's orbit, but rather approximately at one [[focus (geometry)|focus]] of the [[ellipse|elliptical]] orbit. Furthermore, to the extent that a planet's mass cannot be neglected in comparison to the Sun's mass, the center of gravity of the solar system is displaced slightly away from the center of the Sun.&lt;ref name=newt-hc /&gt; (The masses of the planets, mostly [[Jupiter]], amount to 0.14% of that of the Sun.)  Therefore, a hypothetical astronomer on an [[extrasolar planet]] would observe a small "wobble" in the Sun's motion.

===Modern use of ''geocentric'' and ''heliocentric''===
In modern calculations, the terms "geocentric" and "heliocentric" are often used to refer to [[frame of reference|reference frames]].  In such systems the origin in the [[Center of mass#Barycenter in astrophysics and astronomy|center of mass]] of the Earth, of the Earth–Moon system, of the Sun, of the Sun plus the major planets, or of the entire solar system, can be selected.&lt;ref&gt;See [[center-of-mass frame]]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Right ascension]] and [[declination]] are examples of geocentric coordinates, used in Earth-based observations, while the heliocentric latitude and longitude are used for orbital calculations.  This leads to such terms as "heliocentric [[velocity]]" and "heliocentric [[angular momentum]]". In this heliocentric picture, any [[planet]] of the Solar System can be used as a source of [[mechanical energy]] because it moves relatively to the Sun. A smaller [[physical body|body]] (either [[spacecraft|artificial]] or [[astronomical object|natural]]) may gain heliocentric velocity due to [[gravity assist]]&amp;nbsp;– this effect can change the body's mechanical energy in heliocentric reference frame (although it will not changed in the planetary one). However, such selection of "geocentric" or "heliocentric" frames is merely a matter of computation. It does not have philosophical implications and does not constitute a distinct physical or scientific [[scientific model|model]]. From the point of view of [[general relativity]], [[inertial reference frame]]s do not exist at all, and any practical reference frame is only an approximation to the actual space-time, which can have higher or lower precision.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6582">[[File:George Edward Moore.jpg|thumb|George Edward Moore]]
'''Here is one hand''' is an [[Epistemology|epistemological]] [[argument]] created by [[George Edward Moore]] in reaction against [[philosophical skepticism]] and in support of [[common sense]].

The argument takes the following form:
* Here is one hand,
* And here is another.
* There are at least two external objects in the world.
* Therefore, an external world exists.

==Introduction==
G. E. Moore wrote "[[A Defence of Common Sense]]" and ''Proof of an External World''. For the purposes of these essays, he posed [[skeptical hypothesis|skeptical hypotheses]], such as "[[Dream argument|you may be dreaming]]" or "[[Five minute hypothesis|the world is 5 minutes old]]", and then provided his own response to them. Such hypotheses ostensibly create a situation where it is not possible to know that anything in the world exists. These hypotheses take the following form:

=== The skeptical argument ===
Where '''S''' is a subject, '''sp''' is a skeptical possibility, such as the [[brain in a vat]] hypothesis, and '''q''' is a knowledge claim about the world:
:* If '''S''' doesn't know that not-'''sp''', then '''S''' doesn't know that '''q'''
:* '''S''' doesn't know that not-'''sp'''
:* Therefore, '''S''' doesn't know that '''q'''

=== Moore's response ===
Moore does not attack the skeptical premise; instead, he reverses the argument from being in the form of [[modus ponens]] to [[modus tollens]]. This logical maneuver is often called a '''G. E. Moore shift''' or a '''Moorean shift.'''&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/moore/#SH2d|title=From the Ontology of Cognition to Criteriology|last=Preston|first=Aaron|year=2004|website=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|series=George Edward Moore (1873—1958)|access-date=April 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; His response takes the following form:
:* If '''S''' doesn't know that not-'''sp''', then '''S''' doesn't know that '''q'''
:* '''S''' knows that '''q'''
:* Therefore, '''S''' knows that not-'''sp'''

==Explanation==
Moore famously put the point into dramatic relief with his 1939 essay ''Proof of an External World'', in which he gave a common sense argument against skepticism by raising his right hand and saying "here is one hand," and then raising his left and saying "and here is another". Here, Moore is taking his knowledge claim ('''q''') to be that he has two hands, and without rejecting the skeptic's premise, seeks to prove that we can know the skeptical possibility ('''sp''') to be untrue.

Moore's argument is not simply a flippant response to the skeptic.  Moore gives, in ''Proof of an External World'', three requirements for a good proof: (1) the premises must be different from the conclusion, (2) the premises must be demonstrated, and (3) the conclusion must follow from the premises. He claims that his proof of an external world meets those three criteria.

In his 1925 essay "A Defence of Common Sense", Moore argues against [[idealism]] and [[skepticism]] toward the external world on the grounds that skeptics could not give reasons to accept their metaphysical premises that were more plausible to him than the reasons he had to accept the common sense claims about our knowledge of the world that skeptics and idealists must deny. In other words, he is more willing to believe that he has a hand than to believe the premises of what he deems "a strange argument in a university classroom." "I do not think it is rational to be as certain of any one of these ... propositions".&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.calvin.edu/academic/philosophy/virtual_library/articles/derose_keith/responding_to_skepticism.pdf|title=Responding to Skepticism|last=DeRose|first=Keith|year=1999|website=Introduction to 'Skepticism: A Contemporary Reader'|publisher=Oxford UP|access-date=April 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Objections and replies ==
Some subsequent philosophers (especially those inclined to skeptical doubts) have found Moore's method of argument unconvincing.&lt;ref name="podgorski"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://thegemsbok.com/art-reviews-and-articles/friday-phil-radical-skepticism-ge-moore/|title=Intuition All Alone: On G.E. Moore’s Tempting but Insufficient Answer to Radical Skepticism|last=Podgorski|first=Daniel|year=2015|website=The Gemsbok|publisher=|access-date=April 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One form of refutation contends that Moore's attempted proof fails his second criterion for a good proof (i.e. the premises are not demonstrable in the required sense) by pointing out the difference between demonstrating the [[perception]] that his hands exist and demonstrating the [[Epistemology|knowledge]] that his hands exist. Moore may be doing the former when he means to be doing the latter.&lt;ref name="podgorski" /&gt;

Another form of refutation simply points out that not everyone shares Moore's intuition. If a person finds the skeptical possibility '''sp''' more intuitively likely than the knowledge claim '''q''', then for that person Moore's own defense of [[intuition]] provides a basis for their skepticism.&lt;ref name="podgorski" /&gt;

==Legacy==
Appeals of this type are subsequently often called "Moorean facts".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; "A Moorean fact [is] one of those things that we know better than we know the premises of any philosophical argument to the contrary".&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The "here is one hand" idea deeply influenced [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], whose last writings were devoted to a new approach to Moore's argument.&lt;ref name="Sultana40"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sultana|first1=Mark|title=Self-deception and Akrasia: A Comparative Conceptual Analysis|date=2006|publisher=Gregorian Biblical BookShop|isbn=9788878390775|page=40|url=http://www.gbpress.net/it/gregorian/analecta-gregoriana/157-analecta-gregoriana-300.html|accessdate=8 August 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160808195624/http://www.gbpress.net/it/gregorian/analecta-gregoriana/157-analecta-gregoriana-300.html|archivedate=8 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; These remarks were published posthumously as ''[[On Certainty]]''.

Until the beginning of the 20th century, governmental and scholarly documents in Vietnam were written in [[classical Chinese]] (Vietnamese: ''cổ văn'' 古文 or ''văn ngôn'' 文言&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Nguyễn |first=Tri Tài |date=2002 |title=Giáo trình tiếng Hán. Tập I: Cơ sở |publisher=Nhà xuất bản Đại học Quốc gia Thành phố Hồ Chí Minh |page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;), using [[Chinese character]]s with Vietnamese approximations of [[Middle Chinese]] pronunciations.

At the same time popular novels and poetry in [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]] were written in the ''[[chữ nôm]]'' script, which used Chinese characters for [[Sino-Vietnamese vocabulary]] and an adapted set of characters for the native vocabulary.&lt;ref&gt;Asian &amp; Pacific quarterly of cultural and social affairs – Volumes 20–21 Cultural and Social Centre for the Asian and Pacific Region 1988 – Page 7 "... known script that was used by the Vietnamese, the "Southerners," to transcribe their language, in contrast to the Chinese ideographs (called chữ Hán i.e., "Chinese script," or chữ nho i.e. "Confucian script") of the "Northerners," the Chinese."&lt;/ref&gt;

The two scripts coexisted until the era of [[French Indochina]] when the Latin alphabet [[quốc ngữ]] script gradually became the written medium of both government and popular literature.&lt;ref&gt;Vietnam 10 – Page 522 Nick Ray, Yu-Mei Balasingamchow, Iain Stewart – 2009 "For centuries, the Vietnamese language was written in standard Chinese characters (chữ nho). Around the 13th century, the Vietnamese devised their own writing system called chữ nôm (or just nôm), which was created by combining two Chinese words or by using single Chinese characters for their phonetic value. Both writing systems were in use until the 20th century – official business and scholarship was conducted in chữ nho, while chữ nôm was used for popular literature. The Latin-based quốc ngữ script, widely used since WWI, was developed in the 17th century by Alexandre de Rhodes (see the boxed text, right). Quốc ngữ served to undermine the position of Mandarin officials, whose power was based on traditional scholarship in chữ nho and chữ nôm, scripts that were largely inaccessible to the masses."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Terminology==
In Vietnamese, Chinese characters are called ''chữ Hán'' (字漢 "words from [[Han Chinese]]"), ''Hán tự'' (漢字 "[[Han people|Han]] characters/words". The same characters are pronounced as [[Hanzi]] in Chinese [[Putonghua]], [[Hanja]] in [[Korean language|Korean]], and [[Kanji]] in [[Japanese language|Japanese]]), ''Hán văn'' (漢文 "Han script"), or ''chữ nho'' (字儒 "words of [[Confucians]]").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Nguyễn |first=Tài Cẩn |date=2001 |title=Nguồn gốc và quá trình hình thành cách đọc Hán Việt |publisher=Nhà xuất bản Đại học quốc gia Hà Nội |page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Hội Khai-trí tiến-đức |date=1954 |title=Việt-nam tự-điển |publisher=Văn Mới |pages=141, 228}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Đào |first=Duy Anh |date=2005 |title=Hán-Việt từ-điển giản yếu |publisher=Nhà xuất bản Văn hoá Thông tin |page=281}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Hán văn'' (漢文) (literally 'Han literature') denotes Chinese language literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Hội Khai-trí tiến-đức |date=1954 |title=Việt-nam tự-điển |publisher=Văn Mới |page=228}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Đào |first=Duy Anh |date=2005 |title=Hán-Việt từ-điển giản yếu |publisher=Nhà xuất bản Văn hoá Thông tin |pages=281, 900}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Vietnamese word ''chữ'' (character, script, writing, letter) is derived from a [[Middle Chinese]] pronunciation of 字 (Modern [[Pinyin]]: zì), meaning 'character'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Nguyễn |first=Tài Cẩn |date=1995 |title=Giáo trình lịch sử ngữ âm tiếng Việt (sơ thảo) |publisher=Nhà xuất bản Giáo dục |page=47}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sino-Vietnamese vocabulary|Sino-Vietnamese]] (Vietnamese: ''từ Hán Việt'' 詞漢越 "Sino-Vietnamese words") is a term which is used by modern scholars in relation to Vietnam's Chinese-language texts to emphasise local characteristics and particularly the [[phonology]] of the Chinese written in Vietnam, though in regard to [[syntax]] and [[vocabulary]] this Sino-Vietnamese was no more different from Chinese used in Beijing than medieval English Latin was different from the Latin of Rome.&lt;ref&gt;David G. Marr ''Vietnamese Tradition on Trial, 1920–1945'' 1984 p141 "Because the Chinese characters were pronounced according to Vietnamese preferences, and because certain stylistic modifications occurred over time, later scholars came to refer to a hybrid 'Sino-Vietnamese' (Han-Viet) language. However, there would seem to be no more justification for this term than for a Fifteenth Century 'Latin-English' versus the Latin written contemporaneously in Rome."&lt;/ref&gt;

The term [[chữ Nôm]] (字喃 "Southern characters")&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Nguyễn |first=Khuê |date=2009 |title=Chữ Nôm: cơ sở và nâng cao |publisher=Nhà xuất bản Đại học Quốc gia Thành phố Hồ Chí Minh |pages=5, 215}}&lt;/ref&gt; refers to the former transcription system for vernacular Vietnamese-language texts, written using a mixture of original Chinese characters and locally coined [[nôm]] characters not found in Chinese to phonetically represent Vietnamese sounds."&lt;ref&gt;Hugh Dyson Walker East Asia A New History -2012 Page 262 "...chu nom, Vietnamese transcription, using Chinese and nom characters for Vietnamese sounds."&lt;/ref&gt; However the character set for chữ nôm is extensive, up to 20,000, and both arbitrary in composition and inconsistent in pronunciation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hannas |first=Wm. C. |title=Asia's Orthographic Dilemma |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aJfv8Iyd2m4C&amp;pg=PA82 |page=82 |year=1997 |publisher=University of Hawai'i Press |location=Honolulu |quote=The linguistic defects are the same as those noted throughout this book for Chinese characters generally, caused by the large number of tokens (some twenty thousand in ''chữ nôm''), the arbitrariness of their composition, and the inconsistent way the units and their components connect with the sounds of the language.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Hán Nôm'' (漢喃 ‘Han and chữ Nôm characters’)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Trần |first=Văn Chánh |date=January 2012 |title=Tản mạn kinh nghiệm học chữ Hán cổ|journal=Suối Nguồn, tập 3&amp;4 |publisher=Nhà xuất bản Tổng hợp Thành phố Hồ Chí Minh |page=82}}&lt;/ref&gt; may mean either both [[Hán]] and [[Nôm]] taken together, as in the research remit of Hanoi's [[Hán-Nôm Institute]], or refer to texts which are written in a mixture of Hán and Nôm, or refer to some Hán texts with parallel Nôm translations. There is a significant orthographic overlap between Hán and Nôm and many characters are used in both Hán and Nôm with the same reading.&lt;ref&gt;Eva Hung, Judy Wakabayashi ''Asian translation traditions'' 2005 Page 174 "A large portion of the lexicon of the Vietnamese language in recent centuries derives from Hán. Consequently, there is a significant orthographic overlap between Hán and Nôm, which is to say that many characters are used in both with the same meaning. This is primarily a lexical, not a syntactic, phenomenon, although Hán grammar did influence Nôm prose to a relatively significant extent (Xtankevich 1986)"&lt;/ref&gt;

The term [[chữ quốc ngữ]] (字國語 "national language script") means Vietnamese written in romanised script.

== History ==

===Chinese domination===
No known writings in Chinese by Vietnamese writers survive from the [[Chinese domination]] period.&lt;ref name="Cœdès"/&gt;

===Imperial Vietnam===
{{main|Literary Chinese in Vietnam}}
In Imperial Vietnam (939-1919), formal writings were, in most cases, done in classical Chinese. This was true both of the language of government and administration, and also of entry into government and administration by the wholly Chinese-language [[Confucian examination system in Vietnam]]. Chinese was also the language of medicine, astrology, religion, science and high literature such as poetry. Vietnamese existed only as an oral language, before the creation of the nom script to preserve and circulate less serious poetry and narrative literature. These writings are indistinguishable from contemporaneous classical Chinese works produced in [[China]], [[Korea]], or [[Japan]] as are the first poems in chữ nho by the monk [[Khuông Việt]] (匡越) and the ''[[Nam Quốc Sơn Hà]]'' (Hán-Việt/Sino-Vietnamese) / ''[[Sông núi nước Nam]]'' (Native Vietnamese) / 南國山河 (Hán-Nôm) by general [[Lý Thường Kiệt]] (李常傑).&lt;ref name="Cœdès"&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=George Cœdès |first=George |last=Cœdès |title=The Making of South East Asia |year=1966 |translator=H.

In Vietnam, classical Chinese texts were read with the vocalization of Chinese text as such, equivalent to the Chinese [[on'yomi|On-readings]] in [[Japanese language|Japanese]] ''[[kambun]]'' ({{lang|ja|漢文}}), or the assimilated vocalizations in [[Korean language|Korean]] ''[[hanmun]]'' ({{lang|ko|한문/漢文}}).&lt;ref&gt;Bjarke Frellesvig ''A History of the Japanese Language'' 2010 – Page 258 "... the rendition of Chinese text in Japanese, which affected grammar and usage (see 9.1) and (kanbun-)ondoku, the vocalization of Chinese text as such, which paved the way for the intake of a large number of loanwords from Chinese (9.2).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nichibunken newsletter Kokusai Nihon Bunka Kenkyū Sentā 1996 – No23–36 – Page 52 "The novel was then translated from Chinese into Vietnamese by a Vietnamese revolutionist.

===Period of coexistence of two languages and two scripts===
{{main|Vietnamese literature}}
[[File:1938 Vietnamese Birth Certificate in Nôm.jpg|thumb|right|Vietnamese birth certificate in 1938 showing different scripts in descending frequency: quốc ngữ, chữ nôm, chữ nho, French]] 
From the 13th Century the dominance of Chinese writing - chữ nho - began to be challenged by a system of modified and invented characters modeled loosely on Chinese characters called ''[[chữ nôm]]'', which, unlike the system of chữ nho (or chữ Hán), allowed for the expression of purely Vietnamese words, was created in Vietnam at least as early as the 13th century.&lt;ref&gt;Laurence C. Thompson ''A Vietnamese Reference Grammar'' University of Hawaii Press 1965 revised 1987 Page 53 "Chữ nôm apparently existed for several centuries alongside the standard written Chinese of the royal court (called chữ nho 'scholar's characters' or chữ Hán 'Han [i.e., Chinese] characters')."&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Ming dynasty occupation of Vietnam]] chữ nôm printing blocks, texts and inscriptions were destroyed, so that the earliest surviving texts are from after the period.&lt;ref&gt;Mark W. McLeod, Thi Dieu Nguyen ''Culture and Customs of Vietnam'' 2001 Page 68 – "In part because of the ravages of the Ming occupation – the invaders destroyed or removed many Viet texts and the blocks for printing them – the earliest body of nom texts that we have dates from the early post-occupation era ..."&lt;/ref&gt; While designed for native Vietnamese speakers, chữ nôm required the user to have a fair knowledge of chữ Hán, and thus chữ nôm was used primarily for literary writings by cultural elites (such as the poetry of [[Nguyễn Du]] and [[Hồ Xuân Hương]]), while almost all other official writings and documents continued to be written in classical Chinese until the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Ha Minh Nguyen, Bac Hoai Tran, Tuan Duc Vuong ''Colloquial Vietnamese: The Complete Course for Beginners'' Routledge 2012 Page 3 "Because of thousands of years of Chinese domination and influence, the Vietnamese used Chinese characters known as chu nho as their official written language for many centuries. However chu nho was not easy to learn and only the ..."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;D. W. Sloper, Thạc Cán Lê ''Higher Education in Vietnam: Change and Response'' 1995 Page 45 "All teaching materials are written in Han, Chinese classical characters known as chu nho. From about the thirteenth century a Vietnamese system of writing, chu nom or simply nom, was developed. ... chu nho was used for official business and scholarship, while chu nom was used for popular literature."&lt;/ref&gt;

===French colonial period===
The use of classical Chinese, and its written form, chữ nho (or chữ Hán), died out in Vietnam early in the 20th century during the middle years of [[French Indochina]]. At this time there were briefly four competing writing systems in Vietnam; chữ nho, chữ nôm, quốc ngữ, and French.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Simpson ''Language and national identity in Asia'' 2007 Page 428 "..there existed a situation in which there were briefly four different available writing systems in Vietnam, chu nho, chu nom, quoc ngu, and Romanized French. ... (4) The acceptability of quoc ngu was then further heightened by its use to translate works of literature from Chinese and chu nom, as well as through its ..."&lt;/ref&gt; Although the first romanized script [[quốc ngữ]] newspaper, ''[[Gia Dinh Bao]]'', was founded in 1865, Vietnamese nationalists continued to use chữ nôm until after the [[First World War]] when quốc ngữ became the favoured language of the Vietnamese independence movement.&lt;ref&gt;Simon Eliot, Jonathan Rose ''A Companion to the History of the Book'' - Page 124 2009 "The first publication in quoc ngu was the first Vietnamese newspaper, Gia-dinh báo (Daily Paper, 1865), ... During World War I, the colonial administration encouraged quoc ngu journalism for propaganda purposes, and as a result journals"&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars still study it today although its application is mostly confined to the historic context of Vietnamese texts.

===Usage today===

Vietnam also has a long history of calligraphy, but in its earliest form it was called Han Nom, a way of using the Chinese characters to convey Vietnamese words."&lt;/ref&gt;

Use of [[quốc ngữ]] for education in both North and South Vietnam from 1945-1975, and then all of Vietnam since 1975, has rendered most Vietnamese unable to read earlier Vietnamese texts, whether written in Chinese chữ nho, or vernacular chữ nôm. [[Hán Nôm Institute]] is the national centre for academic research into both Hán and [[nôm]] texts. Since the mid-1990s a small resurgence in teaching of Chinese characters, both for chữ nho and the additional characters used in chữ nôm, to enable the study of Vietnam's history has emerged.&lt;ref&gt;Simon Eliot, Jonathan Rose ''A Companion to the History of the Book'' Page 124 – 2011 "Since the use of quoc ngu for education has rendered most Vietnamese now incapable of reading earlier Vietnamese ... an increasing commitment to the publication of translations from Chinese or of transcriptions from nom texts to render ..."&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, many Vietnamese study Hán tự characters as a part of learning modern Japanese and Chinese, and sometimes Korean. This allows a Vietnamese speaker to learn a word in the target language (represented by Chinese characters) in relation to the Vietnamese cognate reading. The significance of the characters has occasionally entered Western depiction of Vietnam; for instance novelist [[E. M. Nathanson]] mentions the characters in ''A Dirty Distant War'' (1987).&lt;ref&gt;E. M. Nathanson ''Dirty Distant War'' 1987 Page 121 "So they took the Chinese ideographs for those words, changed them a little to make them distinctive from the Chinese characters, and in that way developed a written language. That's the script that became what we refer to today as chữ nho."&lt;/ref&gt;

For linguists the [[Sino-Vietnamese reading]]s of Chinese characters provide data for the study of [[historical Chinese phonology]].

{{Thermodynamics|expanded=Potentials}}

In [[thermodynamics]], the '''internal energy''' of a [[thermodynamic system|system]] is the [[energy]] contained within the system, excluding the [[kinetic energy]] of motion, of the system as a whole and the potential energy of the system as a whole due to external force fields. It keeps account of the gains and losses of energy of the system that are due to changes in its internal state.&lt;ref&gt;Crawford, F. H. (1963), pp. 106–107.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Haase, R. (1971), pp. 24–28.&lt;/ref&gt;

The internal energy of a system can be changed by transfers of [[matter]] or [[heat transfer|heat]] or by doing [[Work (thermodynamics)|work]].&lt;ref name="Born 146"&gt;[[Max Born|Born, M.]] (1949), Appendix 8, [https://archive.org/stream/naturalphilosoph032159mbp#page/n157/mode/2up pp. 146–149].&lt;/ref&gt; When matter transfer is prevented by impermeable containing walls, the system is said to be [[Closed system|closed]]. Then the [[first law of thermodynamics]] states that the increase in internal energy is equal to the total heat added plus the work done on the system by its surroundings. If the containing walls pass neither matter nor energy, the system is said to be isolated and its internal energy cannot change. The first law of thermodynamics may be regarded as establishing the existence of the internal energy.

The internal energy is one of the two cardinal [[state function]]s of the state variables of a [[thermodynamic system]].

==Introduction==

The internal energy of a given state of a system cannot be directly measured. It is determined through some convenient chain of [[thermodynamic operation]]s and [[thermodynamic process]]es by which the given state can be prepared, starting with a reference state which is customarily assigned a reference value for its internal energy. Such a chain, or path, can be theoretically described by certain [[Thermodynamics#States and processes|extensive]] state variables of the system, namely, its [[entropy]], {{math|''S''}}, its volume, {{math|''V''}}, and its mole numbers, {{math|{''N&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;''}}}. The internal energy, {{math|''U''(''S'',''V'',{''N&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;''})}}, is a function of those. Sometimes, to that list are appended other extensive state variables, for example [[electric dipole moment]]. For practical considerations in thermodynamics and engineering it is rarely necessary or convenient to consider all energies belonging to the total intrinsic energy of a system, such as the energy given by the equivalence of mass. Customarily, thermodynamic descriptions include only items relevant to the processes under study. Thermodynamics is chiefly concerned only with ''changes'' in the internal energy, not with its absolute value.

The internal energy is a state function of a system, because its value depends only on the current state of the system and not on the path taken or processes undergone to prepare it. It is an [[extensive quantity]]. It is the one and only ''cardinal'' [[thermodynamic potential]].&lt;ref name ="Tschoegl 17"/&gt; Through it, by use of [[Legendre transformation|Legendre transforms]], are mathematically constructed the other thermodynamic potentials. These are functions of variable lists in which some extensive variables are replaced by their [[Conjugate variables (thermodynamics)|conjugate]] [[Thermodynamics#States and processes|intensive variables]]. Legendre transformation is necessary because mere substitutive replacement of extensive variables by intensive variables does not lead to thermodynamic potentials. Mere substitution leads to a less informative formula, an equation of state.

Though it is a [[Macroscopic scale|macroscopic]] quantity, internal energy can be explained in microscopic terms by two theoretical virtual components. One is the microscopic kinetic energy due to the microscopic motion of the system's particles ([[translation (physics)|translations]], [[rotation]]s, [[oscillation|vibrations]]). The other is the potential energy associated with the microscopic forces, including the [[chemical bonds]], between the particles; this is for ordinary physics and chemistry. If thermonuclear reactions are specified as a topic of concern, then the static [[mass-energy equivalence|rest mass energy]] of the constituents of matter is also counted. There is no simple universal relation between these quantities of microscopic energy and the quantities of energy gained or lost by the system in work, heat, or matter transfer.

The [[SI]] unit of [[energy]] is the [[joule]] (J). Sometimes it is convenient to use a corresponding density called ''specific internal energy'' which is internal energy per unit of mass ([[kilogram]]) of the system in question. The SI unit of specific internal energy is J/kg.  If the specific internal energy is expressed relative to units of [[amount of substance]] ([[Mole (unit)|mol]]), then it is referred to as ''molar internal energy'' and the unit is J/mol.

From the standpoint of [[statistical mechanics]], the internal energy is equal to the [[ensemble average]] of the sum of the microscopic kinetic and potential energies of the system.

===Cardinal functions===

The internal energy, {{math|''U''(''S'',''V'',{''N&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;''})}}, expresses the thermodynamics of a system in the ''energy-language'', or in the ''energy representation''. Its arguments are exclusively extensive variables of state. Alongside the internal energy, the other cardinal function of state of a thermodynamic system is its entropy, as a function, {{math|''S''(''U'',''V'',{''N&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;''})}}, of the same list of extensive variables of state, except that the entropy, {{math|''S''}}, is replaced in the list by the internal energy, {{math|''U''}}. It expresses the ''entropy representation''.&lt;ref name ="Tschoegl 17"&gt;Tschoegl, N.W. (2000), p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Callen Ch 5"&gt;[[Herbert Callen|Callen, H.B.]] (1960/1985), Chapter 5.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Münster, A. (1970), p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

Each cardinal function is a monotonic function of each of its ''natural'' or ''canonical'' variables. Each provides its ''characteristic'' or ''fundamental'' equation, for example {{math|''U'' {{=}} ''U''(''S'',''V'',{''N&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;''})}}, that by itself contains all thermodynamic information about the system. The fundamental equations for the two cardinal functions can in principle be interconverted by solving, for example, {{math|''U'' {{=}} ''U''(''S'',''V'',{''N&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;''})}} for {{math|''S''}}, to get {{math|''S'' {{=}} ''S''(''U'',''V'',{''N&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;''})}}.

In contrast, Legendre transforms are necessary to derive fundamental equations for other thermodynamic potentials and [[Massieu function]]s. The entropy as a function only of extensive state variables is the one and only ''cardinal function'' of state for the generation of Massieu functions. It is not itself customarily designated a 'Massieu function', though rationally it might be thought of as such, corresponding to the term 'thermodynamic potential', which includes the internal energy.&lt;ref name="Callen Ch 5"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Münster, A. (1970), Chapter 3.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bailyn, M. (1994), pp. 206–209.&lt;/ref&gt;

For real and practical systems, explicit expressions of the fundamental equations are almost always unavailable, but the functional relations exist in principle. Formal, in principle, manipulations of them are valuable for the understanding of thermodynamics.

==Description and definition==
The internal energy {{math|''U''}} of a given state of the system is determined relative to that of a standard state of the system, by adding up the macroscopic transfers of energy that accompany a change of state from the reference state to the given state:
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta U = \sum_i  E_i\,&lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|Δ''U''}} denotes the difference between the internal energy of the given state and that of the reference state,
and the {{math|''E&lt;sub&gt;i''&lt;/sub&gt;}} are the various energies transferred to the system in the steps from the reference state to the given state.
It is the energy needed to create the given state of the system from the reference state.

From a non-relativistic microscopic point of view, it may be divided into microscopic potential energy, {{math|''U''&lt;sub&gt;micro pot&lt;/sub&gt;}}, and microscopic kinetic energy, {{math|''U''&lt;sub&gt;micro kin&lt;/sub&gt;}}, components:
:&lt;math&gt;U = U_{\mathrm{micro\,pot}} + U_{\mathrm{micro\,kin}}&lt;/math&gt;

The microscopic kinetic energy of a system arises as the sum of the motions of all the system's particles with respect to the center-of-mass frame, whether it be the motion of atoms, molecules, atomic nuclei, electrons, or other particles. The microscopic potential energy algebraic summative components are those of the [[Chemical energy|chemical]] and [[Nuclear potential energy|nuclear]] particle bonds, and the physical force fields within the system, such as due to internal [[electrostatic induction|induced]] electric or [[magnetism|magnetic]] [[dipole]] [[moment (physics)|moment]], as well as the energy of [[deformation (engineering)|deformation]] of solids ([[stress (physics)|stress]]-[[strain (materials science)|strain]]). Usually, the split into microscopic kinetic and potential energies is outside the scope of macroscopic thermodynamics.

Internal energy does not include the energy due to motion or location of a system as a whole. That is to say, it excludes any kinetic or potential energy the body may have because of its motion or location in external [[gravitation]]al, [[electrostatics|electrostatic]], or [[electromagnetics|electromagnetic]] [[field (physics)|field]]s. It does, however, include the contribution of such a field to the energy due to the coupling of the internal degrees of freedom of the object with the field. In such a case, the field is included in the thermodynamic description of the object in the form of an additional external parameter.

For practical considerations in thermodynamics or engineering, it is rarely necessary, convenient, nor even possible, to consider all energies belonging to the total intrinsic energy of a sample system, such as the energy given by the equivalence of mass. Typically, descriptions only include components relevant to the system under study.  Indeed, in most systems under consideration, especially through thermodynamics, it is impossible to calculate the total internal energy.&lt;ref name=klotz&gt;I. Klotz, R. Rosenberg, ''Chemical Thermodynamics - Basic Concepts and Methods'', 7th ed., Wiley (2008), p.39&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, a convenient null reference point may be chosen for the internal energy.

The internal energy is an [[extensive variable|extensive property]]: it depends on the size of the system, or on the [[amount of substance]] it contains.

At any temperature greater than [[absolute zero]], microscopic potential energy and kinetic energy are constantly converted into one another, but the sum remains constant in an [[isolated system]] (cf. table). In the classical picture of thermodynamics, kinetic energy vanishes at zero temperature and the internal energy is purely potential energy. However, quantum mechanics has demonstrated that even at zero temperature particles maintain a residual energy of motion, the [[zero point energy]]. A system at absolute zero is merely in its quantum-mechanical ground state, the lowest energy state available. At absolute zero a system of given composition has attained its minimum attainable [[entropy]].

The microscopic kinetic energy portion of the internal energy gives rise to the temperature of the system. [[Statistical mechanics]] relates the pseudo-random kinetic energy of individual particles to the mean kinetic energy of the entire ensemble of particles comprising a system. Furthermore, it relates the mean microscopic kinetic energy to the macroscopically observed empirical property that is expressed as temperature of the system. This energy is often referred to as the ''thermal energy'' of a system,&lt;ref name=hyperphysics&gt;[http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/kinetic/eqpar.html#c2 Thermal energy] – Hyperphysics&lt;/ref&gt; relating this energy, like the temperature, to the human experience of hot and cold.

Statistical mechanics considers any system to be statistically distributed across an ensemble of ''N'' [[Microstate (statistical mechanics)|microstates]]. Each microstate has an energy ''E''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; and is associated with a probability ''p''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;. The internal energy is the [[mean]] value of the system's total energy, i.e., the sum of all microstate energies, each weighted by their probability of occurrence:
:&lt;math&gt;U = \sum_{i=1}^N p_i \,E_i\ .&lt;/math&gt;
This is the statistical expression of the [[first law of thermodynamics]].

===Internal energy changes===
{| align="right" border=0 cellpadding=5 cellspacing=0
|-
|{{table of thermodynamic systems}}
|}
Thermodynamics is chiefly concerned only with the changes, {{math|Δ''U''}}, in internal energy.

For a closed system, with matter transfer excluded, the changes in internal energy are due to heat transfer {{math|''Q''}} and due to work. The latter can be split into two kinds, pressure-volume work {{math|''W''&lt;sub&gt;pressure-volume&lt;/sub&gt;}}, and frictional and other kinds, such as [[electrical polarization]], which do not alter the volume of the system, and are called isochoric, {{math|''W''&lt;sub&gt;isochoric&lt;/sub&gt;}}. Accordingly, the internal energy change {{math|Δ''U''}} for a process may be written&lt;ref name="Born 146"/&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \Delta U = Q + W_{\mathrm{pressure-volume}} + W_{\mathrm{isochoric}}\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\mathrm{(closed\,\,system,\,\,no\,\,transfer\,\,of\,\,matter)}.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name=signconvention group=note&gt;In this article we choose the sign convention of the mechanical work as typically defined in chemistry, which is different from the convention used in physics. In chemistry, work performed by the system against the environment, e.g., a system expansion, is negative, while in physics this is taken to be positive.&lt;/ref&gt;

When a closed system receives energy as heat, this energy increases the internal energy. It is distributed between microscopic kinetic and microscopic potential energies. In general, thermodynamics does not trace this distribution.  In an ideal gas all of the extra energy results in a temperature increase, as it is stored solely as microscopic kinetic energy; such heating is said to be ''[[Sensible heat|sensible]]''.

A second mechanism of change of internal energy of a closed system is the doing of [[Work (thermodynamics)|work]] on the system, either in mechanical form by changing pressure or volume, or by other perturbations, such as directing an electric current through the system.

If the system is not closed, the third mechanism that can increase the internal energy is transfer of matter into the system. This increase, {{math|Δ''U''&lt;sub&gt;matter&lt;/sub&gt;}} cannot be split into heat and work components. If the system is so set up physically that heat and work can be done on it by pathways separate from and independent of matter transfer, then the transfers of energy add to change the internal energy:
:&lt;math&gt; \Delta U = Q + W_{\mathrm{pressure-volume}} + W_{\mathrm{isochoric}} + \Delta U_{\mathrm{matter}}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{(separate\,\,pathway\,\,for\,\,matter\,\,transfer\,\,from\,\,heat\,\,and\,\,work\,\,transfer\,\,pathways)}.&lt;/math&gt;

If a system undergoes certain phase transformations while being heated, such as melting and vaporization, it may be observed that the temperature of the system does not change until the entire sample has completed the transformation. The energy introduced into the system while the temperature did not change is called a ''latent energy'', or [[latent heat]], in contrast to sensible heat, which is associated with temperature change.

==Internal energy of the ideal gas==
Thermodynamics often uses the concept of the [[ideal gas]] for teaching purposes, and as an approximation for working systems. The ideal gas is a gas of particles considered as point objects that interact only by elastic collisions and fill a volume such that their free mean path between collisions is much larger than their diameter. Such systems are approximated by the [[monatomic]] gases, [[helium]] and the other [[noble gas]]es. Here the kinetic energy consists only of the [[translation (physics)|translational]] energy of the individual atoms. Monatomic particles do not rotate or vibrate, and are not [[energy level|electronically excited]] to higher energies except at very high [[temperature]]s.

Therefore, internal energy changes in an ideal gas may be described solely by changes in its kinetic energy. Kinetic energy is simply the internal energy of the perfect gas and depends entirely on its [[pressure]], [[volume]] and [[thermodynamic temperature]].

The internal energy of an ideal gas is proportional to its mass (number of moles) ''n'' and to its temperature ''T''
: &lt;math&gt; U = c n T, &lt;/math&gt;

where  ''c'' is the heat capacity (at constant volume) of the gas. The internal energy may be written as a function of the three extensive properties ''S'', ''V'', ''n'' (entropy, volume, mass) in the following way &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=van Gool |first1=W. |last2=Bruggink |first2=J.J.C. (Eds) |url= |title=Energy and time in the economic and physical sciences |publisher=North-Holland |year=1985 |pages=41–56 |quote= |isbn=0444877487}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Grubbström | first1 = Robert W. | doi = 10.1016/j.apenergy.2007.01.003 | title = An Attempt to Introduce Dynamics Into Generalised Exergy Considerations| journal = Applied Energy| volume = 84| pages = 701–718 | year = 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;U(S,V,n) = \mathrm{const}  \cdot  e^\frac{S}{cn}    V^\frac{-R}{c}  n^\frac{R+c}{c},&lt;/math&gt;

where ''const'' is an arbitrary positive constant and where ''R'' is the [[Gas constant|universal gas constant]]. It is easily seen that ''U'' is a linearly [[homogeneous function]] of the three variables (that is, it is ''extensive'' in these variables), and that it is weakly [[convex function|convex]]. Knowing temperature and pressure to be the derivatives 
&lt;math&gt;T = \frac{\partial U}{\partial S},&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;p = -\frac{\partial U}{\partial V},&lt;/math&gt; the [[ideal gas law]] &lt;math&gt;PV = nRT&lt;/math&gt; immediately follows.

This above summation of all components of change in internal energy assume that a positive energy denotes heat added to the system or work done on the system, while a negative energy denotes work of the system on the environment.

Typically this relationship is expressed in [[infinitesimal]] terms using the differentials of each term. Only the internal energy is an [[exact differential]]. For a system undergoing only thermodynamics processes, i.e. a closed system that can exchange only heat and work, the change in the internal energy is
:&lt;math&gt; d U = \delta Q + \delta W \, &lt;/math&gt;
which constitutes the [[first law of thermodynamics]].&lt;ref name=signconvention group=note/&gt; It may be expressed in terms of other thermodynamic parameters. Each term is composed of an [[intensive variable]] (a generalized force) and its [[Conjugate variables (thermodynamics)|conjugate]] infinitesimal [[extensive variable]] (a generalized displacement).

For example, for a non-viscous fluid, the mechanical work done on the system may be related to the [[pressure]] ''p'' and [[Volume (thermodynamics)|volume]] ''V''. The pressure is the intensive generalized force, while the volume is the extensive generalized displacement:
:&lt;math&gt;\delta W = - p \mathrm{d}V\,&lt;/math&gt;.
This defines the direction of work, ''W'', to be energy flow from the working system to the surroundings, indicated by a negative term.&lt;ref name=signconvention group=note/&gt; Taking the direction of heat transfer ''Q'' to be into the working fluid and assuming a [[Reversible process (thermodynamics)|reversible process]], the heat is
:&lt;math&gt;\delta Q = T \mathrm{d}S\,&lt;/math&gt;.
::&lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is [[temperature]]
::&lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is [[entropy]]

and the change in internal energy becomes
:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{d}U = T\mathrm{d}S-p\mathrm{d}V \!&lt;/math&gt;

===Changes due to temperature and volume===
The expression relating changes in internal energy to changes in temperature and volume is
:&lt;math&gt;dU =C_{V}dT +\left[T\left(\frac{\partial p}{\partial T}\right)_{V}  - p\right]dV\,\,\text{   (1)}.\,&lt;/math&gt;

This is useful if the [[equation of state]] is known.

In case of an ideal gas, we can derive that &lt;math&gt;dU = C_V dT&lt;/math&gt;, i.e. the internal energy of an ideal gas can be written as a function that depends only on the temperature.

{{hidden begin|border=1px solid lightgray; width: 60%;|title=Proof of pressure independence for an ideal gas}}

The expression relating changes in internal energy to changes in temperature and volume is

:&lt;math&gt;dU =C_{V}dT +\left[T\left(\frac{\partial p}{\partial T}\right)_{V}  - p\right]dV.\,&lt;/math&gt;

The equation of state is the ideal gas law

:&lt;math&gt;p V = n R T.\,&lt;/math&gt;

Solve for pressure:

:&lt;math&gt;p = \frac{n R T}{V}.&lt;/math&gt;

Substitute in to internal energy expression:

:&lt;math&gt;dU =C_{V}dT +\left[T\left(\frac{\partial p}{\partial T}\right)_{V}  - \frac{n R T}{V}\right]dV.\,&lt;/math&gt;

Take the derivative of pressure with respect to temperature:

:&lt;math&gt;\left( \frac{\partial p}{\partial T} \right)_{V} = \frac{n R}{V}.&lt;/math&gt;

Replace:

:&lt;math&gt;dU = C_{V}dT + \left[ \frac{n R T}{V}  - \frac{n R T}{V} \right] dV.&lt;/math&gt;

And simplify:

:&lt;math&gt;dU =C_{V}dT.\,&lt;/math&gt;

{{hidden end}}

{{hidden begin|border=1px solid lightgray; width: 60%;|title=Derivation of dU in terms of dT and dV}}
To express dU in terms of dT and dV, the term

:&lt;math&gt;dS = \left(\frac{\partial S}{\partial T}\right)_{V}dT + \left(\frac{\partial S}{\partial V}\right)_{T}dV \,&lt;/math&gt;

is substituted in the [[fundamental thermodynamic relation]]

:&lt;math&gt;dU = T dS - p dV.\,&lt;/math&gt;

This gives:

:&lt;math&gt;dU = T\left(\frac{\partial S}{\partial T}\right)_{V}dT +\left[T\left(\frac{\partial S}{\partial V}\right)_{T} - p\right]dV.\,&lt;/math&gt;

The term &lt;math&gt;T\left(\frac{\partial S}{\partial T}\right)_{V}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Specific heat capacity#Heat capacity of compressible bodies|heat capacity at constant volume]] &lt;math&gt;C_{V}.&lt;/math&gt;

The partial derivative of ''S'' with respect to ''V'' can be evaluated if the equation of state is known.  From the fundamental thermodynamic relation, it follows that the differential of the [[Helmholtz free energy]] A is given by:

:&lt;math&gt;dA = -S dT - p dV.\,&lt;/math&gt;

The [[symmetry of second derivatives]] of ''A'' with respect to ''T'' and ''V'' yields the [[Maxwell relation]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\left(\frac{\partial S}{\partial V}\right)_{T} = \left(\frac{\partial p}{\partial T}\right)_{V}.\,&lt;/math&gt;

This gives the expression above.
{{hidden end}}

===Changes due to temperature and pressure===
When dealing with fluids or solids, an expression in terms of the temperature and pressure is usually more useful:

:&lt;math&gt;dU = \left(C_{p}-\alpha p V\right)dT +\left(\beta_{T}p-\alpha T\right)Vdp\,&lt;/math&gt;

where it is assumed that the heat capacity at constant pressure is [[Relations between specific heats|related]] to the heat capacity at constant volume according to:

:&lt;math&gt;C_{p} = C_{V} + V T\frac{\alpha^{2}}{\beta_{T}}\,&lt;/math&gt;

{{hidden begin|border=1px solid lightgray; width: 60%;|title=Derivation of dU in terms of dT and dP}}
The partial derivative of the pressure with respect to temperature at constant volume can be expressed in terms of the [[coefficient of thermal expansion]] 
:&lt;math&gt;\alpha \equiv \frac{1}{V}\left(\frac{\partial V}{\partial T}\right)_{p}\,&lt;/math&gt;

and the isothermal [[compressibility]]

:&lt;math&gt;\beta_{T} \equiv -\frac{1}{V}\left(\frac{\partial V}{\partial p}\right)_{T}\,&lt;/math&gt;

by writing:

:&lt;math&gt;dV = \left(\frac{\partial V}{\partial p}\right)_{T}dp + \left(\frac{\partial V}{\partial T}\right)_{p} dT = V\left(\alpha dT-\beta_{T}dp \right)\,\,\text{  (2)} \,&lt;/math&gt;

and equating dV to zero and solving for the ratio dp/dT. This gives:

:&lt;math&gt;\left(\frac{\partial p}{\partial T}\right)_{V}= -\frac{\left(\frac{\partial V}{\partial T}\right)_{p}}{\left(\frac{\partial V}{\partial p}\right)_{T}}= \frac{\alpha}{\beta_{T}}\,\,\text{   (3)}\,&lt;/math&gt;

Substituting (2) and (3) in (1) gives the above expression.
{{hidden end}}

===Changes due to volume at constant temperature===
The [[internal pressure]] is defined as a [[partial derivative]] of the internal energy with respect to the volume at constant temperature:
:&lt;math&gt; \pi _T  = \left ( \frac{\partial U}{\partial V} \right )_T  &lt;/math&gt;

==Internal energy of multi-component systems==
{{unreferenced section|date=November 2015}}
In addition to including the entropy ''S'' and volume ''V'' terms in the internal energy, a system is often described also in terms of the number of particles or chemical species it contains:

:&lt;math&gt;U = U(S,V,N_1,\ldots,N_n)\,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''N''&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt; are the molar amounts of constituents of type ''j'' in the system. The internal energy is an [[extensive variable|extensive]] function of the extensive variables ''S'', ''V'', and the amounts ''N''&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;, the internal energy may be written as a linearly [[homogeneous function]] of first degree:
: &lt;math&gt;U(\alpha S,\alpha V,\alpha N_{1},\alpha N_{2},\ldots )
 = \alpha U(S,V,N_{1},N_{2},\ldots)\,&lt;/math&gt;
where &amp;alpha; is a factor describing the growth of the system. The differential internal energy may be written as
: 
&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{d} U = \frac{\partial U}{\partial S}  \mathrm{d} S  + \frac{\partial U}{\partial V} \mathrm{d} V + \sum_i\ \frac{\partial U}{\partial N_i} \mathrm{d} N_i\ = T \,\mathrm{d} S - p \,\mathrm{d} V + \sum_i\mu_i \mathrm{d} N_i\,&lt;/math&gt;

which shows (or defines) temperature ''T'' to be the partial derivative of ''U'' with respect to entropy ''S'' and pressure ''p'' to be the negative of the similar derivative with respect to volume ''V''
:
&lt;math&gt;T = \frac{\partial U}{\partial S},&lt;/math&gt;
:
&lt;math&gt;p = -\frac{\partial U}{\partial V},&lt;/math&gt;

and where the coefficients &lt;math&gt;\mu_{i}&lt;/math&gt; are the [[chemical potential]]s for the components of type i in the system. The chemical potentials are defined as the partial derivatives of the energy with respect to the variations in composition:
:&lt;math&gt;\mu_i = \left( \frac{\partial U}{\partial N_i} \right)_{S,V, N_{j \ne i}}&lt;/math&gt;
As conjugate variables to the composition &lt;math&gt;\lbrace N_{j} \rbrace&lt;/math&gt;, the chemical potentials are [[intensive and extensive properties|intensive properties]], intrinsically characteristic of the qualitative nature of the system, and not proportional to its extent. Under conditions of constant ''T'' and ''p'', because of the extensive nature of U and its independent variables, using [[Homogeneous function|Euler's homogeneous function theorem]], the differential d''U'' may be integrated and yields an expression for the internal energy:
:&lt;math&gt;U = T S - p V + \sum_i \mu_i N_i\,&lt;/math&gt;.

The sum over the composition of the system is the [[Gibbs free energy]]:
:&lt;math&gt;G = \sum_i \mu_i N_i\,&lt;/math&gt;
that arises from changing the composition of the system at constant temperature and pressure. For a single component system, the chemical potential equals the Gibbs energy per amount of substance, i.e. particles or moles according to the original definition of the unit for &lt;math&gt;\lbrace N_{j} \rbrace&lt;/math&gt;.

==Internal energy in an elastic medium==
For an [[Elasticity (physics)|elastic]] medium the mechanical energy term of the internal energy must be replaced by the more general expression involving the [[Stress (physics)|stress]] &lt;math&gt;\sigma_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; and strain &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_{ij}&lt;/math&gt;. The infinitesimal statement is:

: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{d}U=T\mathrm{d}S+V\sigma_{ij}\mathrm{d}\varepsilon_{ij}&lt;/math&gt;

where [[Einstein notation]] has been used for the tensors, in which there is a summation over all repeated indices in the product term. 
The Euler theorem yields for the internal energy:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Landau|Lifshitz|1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;U=TS+\frac{1}{2}\sigma_{ij}\varepsilon_{ij}&lt;/math&gt;

For a linearly elastic material, the stress is related to the strain by:

: &lt;math&gt;\sigma_{ij}=C_{ijkl} \varepsilon_{kl}&lt;/math&gt;
where the ''C''&lt;sub&gt;ijkl&lt;/sub&gt; are the components of the 4th-rank elastic constant tensor of the medium.

==History==
[[James Prescott Joule|James Joule]] studied the relationship between heat, work, and temperature. He observed that if he did mechanical work on a fluid, such as water, by agitating the fluid, its temperature increased. He proposed that the mechanical work he was doing on the system was converted to ''[[thermal energy]]''. Specifically, he found that 4185.5 joules of energy were needed to raise the temperature of a kilogram of water by one degree Celsius.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Joule|first=J.P.|authorlink=James Prescott Joule|title=On the Mechanical Equivalent of Heat| journal=[[Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society]] | publisher=[[Royal Society]]|year=1850| volume=140|pages=61–82| url=http://rstl.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/140/61 |accessdate=4 June 2016| doi=10.1098/rstl.1850.0004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="39892">{{Trigonometry}}
In [[mathematics]], the '''inverse trigonometric functions''' (occasionally also called '''arcus functions''',&lt;ref name="Taczanowski_1978"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hazewinkel_1994"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ebner_2005"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mejlbro_2010"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Duran_2012"/&gt; '''antitrigonometric functions'''&lt;ref name="Hall_1909"/&gt; or '''cyclometric functions'''&lt;ref name="Klein_1924"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Klein_2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Dörrie_1965"/&gt;) are the [[inverse function]]s of the [[trigonometric functions]] (with suitably restricted [[Domain of a function|domain]]s). Specifically, they are the inverses of the [[sine]], [[cosine]], [[tangent (trigonometry)|tangent]], [[cotangent]], [[secant (trigonometry)|secant]], and [[cosecant]] functions, and are used to obtain an angle from any of the angle's trigonometric ratios. Inverse trigonometric functions are widely used in [[engineering]], [[navigation]], [[physics]], and [[geometry]].

==Notation==
There are several notations used for the inverse trigonometric functions.

The most common convention is to name inverse trigonometric functions using an arc- prefix, e.g., {{math|arcsin(''x'')}}, {{math|arccos(''x'')}}, {{math|arctan(''x'')}}, etc.&lt;ref name="Hall_1909"/&gt; This convention is used throughout the article.
When measuring in radians, an angle of θ radians will correspond to an arc whose length is rθ, where r is the radius of the circle. Thus, in the [[unit circle]], "the arc whose cosine is x" is the same as "the angle whose cosine is x", because the length of the arc of the circle in radii is the same as the measurement of the angle in radians.&lt;ref name="Americana_1912"/&gt; Similarly, in computer programming languages the inverse trigonometric functions are usually called asin, acos, atan.

The notations {{math|sin&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;(''x'')}}, {{math|cos&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;(''x'')}}, {{math|tan&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;(''x'')}}, etc., as introduced by [[John Herschel]] in 1813,&lt;ref name="Cajori"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Herschel_1813"/&gt; are often used as well in British&lt;ref name="Hall_1909"/&gt; sources, and this convention complies with the notation of an [[inverse function]]. This might appear to conflict logically with the common semantics for expressions like {{math|sin&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;(''x'')}}, which refer to numeric power rather than function composition, and therefore may result in confusion between [[multiplicative inverse]] and [[Inverse function|compositional inverse]]. The confusion is somewhat ameliorated by the fact that each of the reciprocal trigonometric functions has its own name—for example, {{math|(cos(''x''))&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;}} = {{math|sec(''x'')}}. Nevertheless, certain authors advise against using it for its ambiguity.&lt;ref name="Hall_1909"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Korn_2000"/&gt; Another convention used by a few authors&lt;ref name="Bhatti_1999"/&gt; is to use a [[majuscule]] (capital/upper-case) first letter along with a &amp;minus;1 superscript, e.g., {{math|Sin&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;(''x'')}}, {{math|Cos&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;(''x'')}}, {{math|Tan&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;(''x'')}}, etc., which avoids confusing them with the multiplicative inverse, which should be represented by {{math|sin&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;(''x'')}}, {{math|cos&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;(''x'')}}, etc. Since 2009, the [[ISO_80000-2#Function_symbols_and_definitions|ISO 80000-2]] standard has removed the ambiguity by specifying solely the "arc" prefix for the inverse functions.

==Basic properties==

===Principal values===
Since none of the six trigonometric functions are [[One-to-one function|one-to-one]], they are restricted in order to have inverse functions. Therefore the [[Range (mathematics)|range]]s of the inverse functions are proper [[subset]]s of the domains of the original functions.

For example, using ''function'' in the sense of [[multivalued function]]s, just as the [[square root]] function {{math|''y'' {{=}} {{sqrt|''x''}}}} could be defined from {{math|''y''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; {{=}} ''x''}}, the function {{math|''y'' {{=}} arcsin(''x'')}} is defined so that sin(''y'') = ''x''. For a given real number ''x'', with −1 ≤ ''x'' ≤ 1, there are multiple (in fact, countably infinitely many) numbers ''y'' such that {{math|sin(''y'') {{=}} ''x''}}; for example, {{math|sin(0) {{=}} 0}}, but also {{math|sin(&amp;pi;) {{=}} 0}}, {{math|sin(2&amp;pi;) {{=}} 0}}, etc. When only one value is desired, the function may be restricted to its [[principal branch]]. With this restriction, for each ''x'' in the domain the expression {{math|arcsin(''x'')}} will evaluate only to a single value, called its [[principal value]]. These properties apply to all the inverse trigonometric functions.

The principal inverses are listed in the following table.

(Note: Some authors define the range of arcsecant to be ( 0 ≤ ''y'' &lt; {{sfrac|{{pi}}|2}} or {{pi}} ≤ ''y'' &lt; {{sfrac|3{{pi}}|2}} ), because the tangent function is nonnegative on this domain. This makes some computations more consistent. For example using this range, {{math|tan(arcsec(''x'')) {{=}} {{sqrt|''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; − 1}}}}, whereas with the range ( 0 ≤ ''y'' &lt; {{sfrac|{{pi}}|2}} or {{sfrac|{{pi}}|2}} &lt; ''y'' ≤ {{pi}} ), we would have to write {{math|tan(arcsec(''x'')) {{=}} ±{{sqrt|''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; − 1}}}}, since tangent is nonnegative on 0 ≤ ''y'' &lt; {{sfrac|{{pi}}|2}} but nonpositive on {{sfrac|{{pi}}|2}} &lt; ''y'' ≤ {{pi}}. For a similar reason, the same authors define the range of arccosecant to be −{{pi}} &lt; ''y'' ≤ −{{sfrac|{{pi}}|2}} or 0 &lt; ''y'' ≤ {{sfrac|{{pi}}|2}}.)

If ''x'' is allowed to be a [[complex number]], then the range of ''y'' applies only to its real part.

===Relationships between trigonometric functions and inverse trigonometric functions===

Trigonometric functions of inverse trigonometric functions are tabulated below. A quick way to derive them is by considering the geometry of a right-angled triangle, with one side of length 1, and another side of length ''x'' (any real number between 0 and 1), then applying the [[Pythagorean theorem]] and definitions of the trigonometric ratios. Purely algebraic derivations are longer.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

\arccos(x) &amp;= \frac{\pi}{2} - \arcsin(x) \\[0.5em]

\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Reciprocal arguments:

\arccos\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) &amp;= \arcsec(x) \\[0.3em]
\arcsin\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) &amp;= \arccsc(x) \\[0.3em]

\arcsec\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) &amp;= \arccos(x) \\[0.3em]
\arccsc\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) &amp;= \arcsin(x)
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

If you only have a fragment of a sine table:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\arccos(x) &amp;= \arcsin\left(\sqrt{1 - x^2}\right) \, , \text{ if } 0 \leq x \leq 1 \\
\arccos(x) &amp;= \frac{1}{2}\arccos\left(2x^2-1\right) \, , \text{ if } 0 \leq x \leq 1 \\
\arcsin(x) &amp;= \frac{1}{2}\arccos\left(1-2x^2\right) \, , \text{ if } 0 \leq x \leq 1 \\
\arcsin(x) &amp;= \arctan\left(\frac{x}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}}\right) \\
\arctan(x) &amp;= \arcsin\left(\frac{x}{\sqrt{1 + x^2}}\right)
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Whenever the square root of a complex number is used here, we choose the root with the positive real part (or positive imaginary part if the square was negative real).

From the [[tangent half-angle formula|half-angle formula]], &lt;math&gt;\tan\left(\tfrac{\theta}{2}\right) = \tfrac{\sin(\theta)}{1 + \cos(\theta)}&lt;/math&gt;, we get:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\arcsin(x) &amp;= 2 \arctan\left(\frac{x}{1 + \sqrt{1 - x^2}}\right) \\[0.5em]
\arccos(x) &amp;= 2 \arctan\left(\frac{\sqrt{1 - x^2}}{1 + x}\right) \, , \text{ if } -1 &lt; x \leq + 1 \\[0.5em]
\arctan(x) &amp;= 2 \arctan\left(\frac{x}{1 + \sqrt{1 + x^2}}\right)
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

===Arctangent addition formula===
:&lt;math&gt;\arctan(u) \pm \arctan(v) = \arctan\left(\frac{u \pm v}{1 \mp uv}\right) \pmod \pi \, , \quad u v \ne 1 \, .&lt;/math&gt;
This is derived from the tangent [[Angle sum and difference identities|addition formula]]
:&lt;math&gt;\tan(\alpha \pm \beta) = \frac{\tan(\alpha) \pm \tan(\beta)}{1 \mp \tan(\alpha)\tan(\beta)} \, ,&lt;/math&gt;
by letting
:&lt;math&gt;\alpha = \arctan(u) \, , \quad \beta = \arctan(v) \, .&lt;/math&gt;

==In calculus==

==={{anchor|Derivatives}}Derivatives of inverse trigonometric functions===
:{{Main|Differentiation of trigonometric functions}}

The [[derivative]]s for complex values of ''z'' are as follows:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\frac{d}{dz} \arcsin(z) &amp;{} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-z^2}} \; ;   &amp;z &amp;{}\neq -1, +1 \\
\frac{d}{dz} \arccos(z) &amp;{} = -\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-z^2}} \; ;  &amp;z &amp;{}\neq -1, +1 \\
\frac{d}{dz} \arctan(z) &amp;{} = \frac{1}{1+z^2} \; ;          &amp;z &amp;{}\neq -i, +i\\
\frac{d}{dz} \arccot(z) &amp;{} = -\frac{1}{1+z^2} \; ;         &amp;z &amp;{}\neq -i, +i \\
\frac{d}{dz} \arcsec(z) &amp;{} = \frac{1}{z^2 \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{z^{2}}}} \; ;   &amp;z &amp;{}\neq -1, 0, +1 \\
\frac{d}{dz} \arccsc(z) &amp;{} = -\frac{1}{z^2 \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{z^{2}}}} \; ;  &amp;z &amp;{}\neq -1, 0, +1
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
Only for real values of ''x'':
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\frac{d}{dx} \arcsec(x) &amp;{} = \frac{1}{|x| \sqrt{x^2-1}} \; ;  &amp; |x| &gt; 1\\
\frac{d}{dx} \arccsc(x) &amp;{} = -\frac{1}{|x| \sqrt{x^2-1}} \; ; &amp; |x| &gt; 1
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

For a sample derivation: if &lt;math&gt;\theta = \arcsin(x)&lt;/math&gt;, we get:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d \arcsin(x)}{dx} = \frac{d \theta}{d \sin(\theta)} = \frac{d \theta}{\cos(\theta)d \theta} = \frac{1}{\cos(\theta)} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-\sin^2(\theta)}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-x^2}}&lt;/math&gt;

===Expression as definite integrals===
Integrating the derivative and fixing the value at one point gives an expression for the inverse trigonometric function as a definite integral:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\arcsin(x) &amp;{}= \int_0^x \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - z^2}} \, dz \; , &amp; |x| &amp;{} \leq 1\\
\arccos(x) &amp;{}= \int_x^1 \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - z^2}} \, dz \; , &amp; |x| &amp;{} \leq 1\\
\arctan(x) &amp;{}= \int_0^x \frac{1}{z^2 + 1} \, dz \; ,\\
\arccot(x) &amp;{}= \int_x^\infty \frac{1}{z^2 + 1} \, dz \; ,\\
\arcsec(x) &amp;{}= \int_1^x \frac{1}{z \sqrt{z^2 - 1}} \, dz = \pi + \int_x^{-1} \frac{1}{z \sqrt{z^2 - 1}} \, dz\; , &amp; x &amp;{} \geq 1\\
\arccsc(x) &amp;{}= \int_x^\infty \frac{1}{z \sqrt{z^2 - 1}} \, dz = \int_{-\infty}^x \frac{1}{z \sqrt{z^2 - 1}} \, dz \; , &amp; x &amp;{} \geq 1\\
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
When ''x'' equals 1, the integrals with limited domains are [[improper integral]]s, but still well-defined.

===Infinite series===
Like the sine and cosine functions, the inverse trigonometric functions can be calculated using [[power series]], as follows. For arcsine, the series can be derived by expanding its derivative, &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-z^2}}&lt;/math&gt;, as a [[binomial series]], and integrating term by term (using the integral definition as above). The series for arctangent can similarly be derived by expanding its derivative &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{1+z^2}&lt;/math&gt; in a [[geometric series]] and applying the integral definition above (see [[Leibniz series]]).

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\arcsin(z) &amp; = z + \left( \frac{1}{2} \right) \frac{z^3}{3} + \left( \frac{1 \cdot 3}{2 \cdot 4} \right) \frac{z^5}{5} + \left( \frac{1 \cdot 3 \cdot 5}{2 \cdot 4 \cdot 6} \right) \frac{z^7}{7} + \cdots \\[5pt]
&amp; = \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{(2n-1)!!}{(2n)!!} \cdot \frac{z^{2n+1}}{2n+1} \\[5pt]
&amp; = \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{\binom{2n} n z^{2n+1}}{4^n (2n+1)} \, ; \qquad |z| \le 1
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\arctan(z)
= z - \frac{z^3}{3} +\frac{z^5}{5} - \frac{z^7}{7} + \cdots
= \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{(-1)^n z^{2n+1}}{2n+1} \, ; \qquad |z| \le 1 \qquad z \neq i,-i&lt;/math&gt;

Series for the other inverse trigonometric functions can be given in terms of these according to the relationships given above.  For example, &lt;math&gt;\arccos(x) = \pi/2 - \arcsin(x)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\arccsc(x) = \arcsin(1/x)&lt;/math&gt;, and so on.  Another series is given by:&lt;ref name="Borwein_2004"/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;2\left(\arcsin\left(\frac{x}{2}\right) \right)^2 = \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{x^{2n}}{n^2\binom {2n} n}&lt;/math&gt;

[[Leonhard Euler]] found a series for the arctangent that converges more quickly than its [[Taylor series]]:

: &lt;math&gt;\arctan(z) = \frac z {1 + z^2} \sum_{n=0}^\infty \prod_{k=1}^n \frac{2k z^2}{(2k + 1)(1 + z^2)}.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title= An elementary derivation of Euler’s series for the arctangent function|journal = The Mathematical Gazette | author = Hwang Chien-Lih | doi = 10.1017/S0025557200178404 | year = 2005 | volume = 89 | issue = 516}}&lt;/ref&gt;
(The term in the sum for ''n'' = 0 is the [[empty product]], so is 1.)

Alternatively, this can be expressed as

:&lt;math&gt;\arctan(z) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{2^{2n} (n!)^2}{(2n + 1)!} \; \frac{z^{2n + 1}}{(1 + z^2)^{n + 1}}.&lt;/math&gt;

====Continued fractions for arctangent====
Two alternatives to the power series for arctangent are these [[generalized continued fraction]]s:

: &lt;math&gt;\arctan(z) =
\frac z {1 + \cfrac{(1z)^2}{3 - 1z^2 + \cfrac{(3z)^2}{5 - 3z^2 + \cfrac{(5z)^2}{7 - 5z^2 + \cfrac{(7z)^2}{9-7z^2 + \ddots}}}}} =
\frac{z}{1 + \cfrac{(1z)^2}{3 + \cfrac{(2z)^2}{5 + \cfrac{(3z)^2}{7 + \cfrac{(4z)^2}{9 + \ddots}}}}}
&lt;/math&gt;

The second of these is valid in the cut complex plane. There are two cuts, from &amp;minus;'''i''' to the point at infinity, going down the imaginary axis, and from '''i''' to the point at infinity, going up the same axis. It works best for real numbers running from −1 to 1. The partial denominators are the odd natural numbers, and the partial numerators (after the first) are just (''nz'')&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, with each perfect square appearing once. The first was developed by [[Leonhard Euler]]; the second by [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]] utilizing the [[Gaussian hypergeometric series]].

===Indefinite integrals of inverse trigonometric functions===

For real and complex values of ''z'':
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\int \arcsin(z) \, dz &amp;{}= z \, \arcsin(z) + \sqrt{1 - z^2} + C\\
\int \arccos(z) \, dz &amp;{}= z \, \arccos(z) - \sqrt{1 - z^2} + C\\
\int \arctan(z) \, dz &amp;{}= z \, \arctan(z) - \frac{1}{2} \ln \left( 1 + z^2 \right) + C\\
\int \arccot(z) \, dz &amp;{}= z \, \arccot(z) + \frac{1}{2} \ln \left( 1 + z^2 \right) + C\\
\int \arcsec(z) \, dz &amp;{}= z \, \arcsec(z) - \ln \left[ z \left( 1 + \sqrt{ \frac{z^2-1}{z^2} } \right) \right] + C\\
\int \arccsc(z) \, dz &amp;{}= z \, \arccsc(z) + \ln \left[ z \left( 1 + \sqrt{ \frac{z^2-1}{z^2} } \right) \right] + C
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

For real ''x'' ≥ 1:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\int \arcsec(x) \, dx &amp;{}= x \, \arcsec(x) - \ln \left( x + \sqrt{x^2-1} \right) + C\\
\int \arccsc(x) \, dx &amp;{}= x \, \arccsc(x) + \ln \left( x + \sqrt{x^2-1} \right) + C
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

For all real ''x'' not between -1 and 1:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\int \arcsec(x) \, dx &amp;{}= x \, \arcsec(x) - \sgn(x) \ln\left(\left| x + \sqrt{x^2-1}\right|\right) + C\\
\int \arccsc(x) \, dx &amp;{}= x \, \arccsc(x) + \sgn(x) \ln\left(\left| x + \sqrt{x^2-1}\right|\right) + C
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The absolute value is necessary to compensate for both negative and positive values of the arcsecant and arccosecant functions. The signum function is also necessary due to the absolute values in the [[#Derivatives|derivative]]s of the two functions, which create two different solutions for positive and negative values of x. These can be further simplified using the logarithmic definitions of the [[Inverse hyperbolic functions#Logarithmic representation|inverse hyperbolic function]]s:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\int \arcsec(x) \, dx &amp;{}= x \, \arcsec(x) - \operatorname{arcosh}(|x|) + C\\
\int \arccsc(x) \, dx &amp;{}= x \, \arccsc(x) + \operatorname{arcosh}(|x|) + C\\
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The absolute value in the argument of the arcosh function creates a negative half of its graph, making it identical to the signum logarithmic function shown above.

All of these antiderivatives can be derived using [[integration by parts]] and the simple derivative forms shown above.

====Example====
Using &lt;math&gt;\int u \, dv = u v - \int v \, du&lt;/math&gt; (i.e. [[integration by parts]]), set

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
u &amp;= \arcsin(x) &amp; dv &amp;= dx \\
du &amp;= \frac{dx}{\sqrt{1-x^2}} &amp; v &amp;= x
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Then

:&lt;math&gt;\int \arcsin(x) \, dx = x \arcsin(x) - \int \frac{x}{\sqrt{1-x^2}} \, dx,&lt;/math&gt;

which by a simple [[Integration by substitution|substitution]] yields the final result:

:&lt;math&gt;\int \arcsin(x) \, dx = x \arcsin(x) + \sqrt{1-x^2} + C &lt;/math&gt;

== Extension to complex plane ==

[[File:Riemann surface for Arg of ArcTan of x.svg|thumb|A [[Riemann surface]] for the argument of the Tan[z]=x function in the complex plane of x. The orange sheet in the middle is the principal sheet representing ArcTan(x). The blue sheet above and green sheet below are displaced by 2 &amp;pi; and -2 &amp;pi; respectively.]]

Since the inverse trigonometric functions are [[analytic function]]s, they can be extended from the real line to the complex plane. This results in functions with multiple sheets and [[branch point]]s. One possible way of defining the extension is:
:&lt;math&gt;\arctan(z) = \int_0^z \frac{dx}{1 + x^2} \quad z \neq -i, +i &lt;/math&gt;
where the part of the imaginary axis which does not lie strictly between the branch points (&amp;minus;i and +i) is the [[branch cut]] between the principal sheet and other sheets. The path of the integral must not cross a branch cut. For ''z'' not on a branch cut, a straight line path from 0 to ''z'' is such a path. For ''z'' on a branch cut, the path must approach from Re[x]&gt;0 for the upper branch cut and from Re[x]&lt;0 for the lower branch cut.

The arcsine function may then be defined as:

:&lt;math&gt;\arcsin(z) = \arctan\left(\frac{z}{\sqrt{1 - z^2}}\right) \quad z \neq -1, +1 &lt;/math&gt;
where (the square-root function has its cut along the negative real axis and) the part of the real axis which does not lie strictly between &amp;minus;1 and +1 is the branch cut between the principal sheet of arcsin and other sheets;
:&lt;math&gt;\arccos(z) = \frac{\pi}{2} - \arcsin(z) \quad z \neq -1, +1 &lt;/math&gt;
which has the same cut as arcsin;
:&lt;math&gt;\arccot(z) = \frac{\pi}{2} - \arctan(z) \quad z \neq -i, i &lt;/math&gt;
which has the same cut as arctan;
:&lt;math&gt;\arcsec(z) = \arccos\left(\frac{1}{z}\right) \quad z \neq -1, 0, +1 &lt;/math&gt;
where the part of the real axis between &amp;minus;1 and +1 inclusive is the cut between the principal sheet of arcsec and other sheets;
:&lt;math&gt;\arccsc(z) = \arcsin\left(\frac{1}{z}\right) \quad z \neq -1, 0, +1 &lt;/math&gt;
which has the same cut as '''arcsec'''.

===Logarithmic forms===
These functions may also be expressed using [[complex logarithm]]s. This extends in a natural fashion their [[domain of a function|domain]] to the [[complex plane]].

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\arcsin(z) &amp;{}= -i \ln \left( iz + \sqrt{1-z^2} \right) &amp;{}= \arccsc\left(\frac{1}{z}\right) \\[10pt]
\arccos(z) &amp;{}= -i \ln \left( z + \sqrt{z^2-1} \right) = \frac{\pi}{2} \, + i \ln \left( iz + \sqrt{1-z^2} \right) = \frac{\pi}{2} - \arcsin(z) &amp;{}= \arcsec\left(\frac{1}{z}\right) \\[10pt]
\arctan(z) &amp;{}= \tfrac{1}{2} i \left[ \ln \left(1 - iz \right) - \ln \left( 1 + iz \right) \right] &amp;{}= \arccot\left(\frac{1}{z}\right) \\[10pt]
\arccot(z) &amp;{}= \tfrac{1}{2} i \left[ \ln \left(1 - \frac{i}{z} \right) - \ln \left( 1 + \frac{i}{z} \right) \right] &amp;{}= \arctan\left(\frac{1}{z}\right) \\[10pt]
\arcsec(z) &amp;{}= -i \ln \left( \sqrt{\frac{1}{z^2} - 1} + \frac{1}{z} \right) = i \, \ln \left( \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{z^2}} + \frac{i}{z} \right) + \frac{\pi}{2} = \frac{\pi}{2} - \arccsc(z) &amp;{}= \arccos\left(\frac{1}{z}\right) \\[10pt]
\arccsc(z) &amp;{}= -i \ln \left( \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{z^2}} + \frac{i}{z}\right) &amp;{}= \arcsin\left(\frac{1}{z}\right)
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Elementary proofs of these relations proceed via expansion to exponential forms of the trigonometric functions.

====Example proof====

:&lt;math&gt;\sin(\phi) = z &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\phi = \arcsin(z)&lt;/math&gt;

Using the [[Trigonometric functions#Relationship to exponential function and complex numbers|exponential definition of sine]], one obtains

:&lt;math&gt;z = \frac{e^{\phi i} - e^{-\phi i}}{2i}&lt;/math&gt;

Let

:&lt;math&gt;\xi = e^{\phi i} &lt;/math&gt;

Solving for &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;z = \frac{\xi - \frac{1}{\xi}}{2i}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;2iz = {\xi - \frac{1}{\xi}}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;{\xi - 2iz - \frac{1}{\xi}} = 0&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\xi^2 - 2i \xi z - 1 \, = \, 0&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\xi = iz \pm \sqrt{1-z^2} = e^{\phi i}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\phi i = \ln \left( iz \pm \sqrt{1-z^2} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\phi= -i \ln \left( iz \pm \sqrt{1-z^2} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

(the positive branch is chosen)

:&lt;math&gt;\phi= \arcsin(z) = -i \ln \left(iz + \sqrt{1-z^2} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

==Applications==

===General solutions===
Each of the trigonometric functions is periodic in the real part of its argument, running through all its values twice in each interval of 2{{pi}}. Sine and cosecant begin their period at 2{{pi}}''k'' − {{sfrac|{{pi}}|2}} (where ''k'' is an integer), finish it at 2{{pi}}''k'' + {{sfrac|{{pi}}|2}}, and then reverse themselves over 2{{pi}}''k'' + {{sfrac|{{pi}}|2}} to 2{{pi}}''k'' + {{sfrac|3{{pi}}|2}}. Cosine and secant begin their period at 2{{pi}}''k'', finish it at 2{{pi}}''k'' + {{pi}}, and then reverse themselves over 2{{pi}}''k'' + {{pi}} to 2{{pi}}''k'' + 2{{pi}}. Tangent begins its period at 2{{pi}}''k'' − {{sfrac|{{pi}}|2}}, finishes it at 2{{pi}}''k'' + {{sfrac|{{pi}}|2}}, and then repeats it (forward) over 2{{pi}}''k'' + {{sfrac|{{pi}}|2}} to 2{{pi}}''k'' + {{sfrac|3{{pi}}|2}}. Cotangent begins its period at 2{{pi}}''k'', finishes it at 2{{pi}}''k'' + {{pi}}, and then repeats it (forward) over 2{{pi}}''k'' + {{pi}} to 2{{pi}}''k'' + 2{{pi}}.

This periodicity is reflected in the general inverses where ''k'' is some integer:
:&lt;math&gt;\sin(y) = x \; \Leftrightarrow \; y = \arcsin(x) + 2\pi k \; \text{ or } \; y = \pi - \arcsin(x) + 2\pi k&lt;/math&gt;
:which, written in one equation, is: &lt;math&gt;\sin(y) = x \; \Leftrightarrow \; y = (-1)^k\arcsin(x) + \pi k.&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\cos(y) = x \; \Leftrightarrow \; y = \arccos(x) + 2\pi k \; \text{ or } \; y = 2\pi - \arccos(x) + 2\pi k&lt;/math&gt;
:which, written in one equation, is: &lt;math&gt;\cos(y) = x \; \Leftrightarrow \; y = \pm \arccos(x) + 2\pi k.&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\tan(y) = x \; \Leftrightarrow \; y = \arctan(x) + \pi k&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\cot(y) = x \; \Leftrightarrow \; y = \arccot(x) + \pi k&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\sec(y) = x \; \Leftrightarrow \; y = \arcsec(x) + 2\pi k \text{ or } y = 2\pi - \arcsec (x) + 2\pi k&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\csc(y) = x \; \Leftrightarrow \; y = \arccsc(x) + 2\pi k \text{ or } y = \pi - \arccsc(x) + 2\pi k&lt;/math&gt;

====Application: finding the angle of a right triangle====
[[Image:Trigonometry triangle.svg|right|thumb|A right triangle.]]
Inverse trigonometric functions are useful when trying to determine the remaining two angles of a [[right triangle]] when the lengths of the sides of the triangle are known. Recalling the right-triangle definitions of sine and cosine, it follows that

:&lt;math&gt;\theta = \arcsin \left( \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}} \right) = \arccos \left( \frac{\text{adjacent}}{\text{hypotenuse}} \right) .&lt;/math&gt;

Often, the hypotenuse is unknown and would need to be calculated before using arcsine or arccosine using the [[Pythagorean Theorem]]: &lt;math&gt;a^2+b^2=h^2&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; is the length of the hypotenuse. Arctangent comes in handy in this situation, as the length of the hypotenuse is not needed.

:&lt;math&gt;\theta = \arctan \left( \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{adjacent}} \right) \, .&lt;/math&gt;

For example, suppose a roof drops 8 feet as it runs out 20 feet. The roof makes an angle ''θ'' with the horizontal, where ''θ'' may be computed as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;\theta
= \arctan \left( \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{adjacent}} \right)
= \arctan \left( \frac{\text{rise}}{\text{run}} \right)
= \arctan \left( \frac{8}{20} \right) \approx 21.8^{\circ} \, .&lt;/math&gt;

===In computer science and engineering===

====Two-argument variant of arctangent====
{{anchor|Two-argument variant of arctangent}}
{{main|atan2}}
The two-argument [[atan2]] function computes the arctangent of ''y'' / ''x'' given ''y'' and ''x'', but with a range of (−{{pi}},&amp;nbsp;{{pi}}]. In other words, atan2(''y'',&amp;nbsp;''x'') is the angle between the positive ''x''-axis of a plane and  the point (''x'',&amp;nbsp;''y'') on it, with positive sign for counter-clockwise angles (upper half-plane, ''y''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0), and negative sign for clockwise angles (lower half-plane, ''y''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;0). It was first introduced in many computer programming languages, but it is now also common in other fields of science and engineering.
 
In terms of the standard '''arctan''' function, that is with range of (−{{sfrac|{{pi}}|2}}, {{sfrac|{{pi}}|2}}), it can be expressed as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{atan2}(y, x) = \begin{cases}
  \arctan(\frac y x) &amp; \quad x &gt; 0 \\
  \arctan(\frac y x) + \pi &amp; \quad y \ge 0 \; , \; x &lt; 0 \\
  \arctan(\frac y x) - \pi &amp; \quad y &lt; 0 \; , \; x &lt; 0 \\
  \frac{\pi}{2} &amp; \quad y &gt; 0 \; , \; x = 0 \\
  -\frac{\pi}{2} &amp; \quad y &lt; 0 \; , \; x = 0 \\
  \text{undefined} &amp; \quad y = 0 \; , \; x = 0
\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

It also equals the [[principal value]] of the [[arg (mathematics)|arg]]ument of the [[complex number]] ''x''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;'''i'''''y''.

This function may also be defined using the [[tangent half-angle formula]]e as follows:
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{atan2}(y, x) = 2\arctan\left(\frac{y}{\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} + x}\right)&lt;/math&gt;
provided that either ''x''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0 or ''y''&amp;nbsp;≠&amp;nbsp;0. However this fails if given x&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;0 and y&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 so the expression is unsuitable for computational use.

The above argument order (''y'', ''x'') seems to be the most common, and in particular is used in [[ISO standard]]s such as the [[C (programming language)|C programming language]], but a few authors may use the opposite convention (''x'', ''y'') so some caution is warranted.  These variations are detailed at [[atan2#Realizations of the function in common programming languages|atan2]].

====Arctangent function with location parameter====
In many applications{{which|date=March 2014}} the solution &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; of the equation &lt;math&gt;x=\tan(y)&lt;/math&gt; is to come as close as possible to a given value &lt;math&gt;-\infty &lt; \eta &lt; \infty&lt;/math&gt;. The adequate solution is produced by the parameter modified arctangent function 
:&lt;math&gt;
y = \arctan_\eta(x) := \arctan(x) + \pi \cdot \operatorname{rni}\left(\frac{\eta - \arctan(x)}{\pi} \right)\, .
&lt;/math&gt;
The function &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{rni}&lt;/math&gt; rounds to the nearest integer.

====Numerical accuracy====

For angles near 0 and {{pi}}, arccosine is [[ill-conditioned]] and will thus calculate the angle with reduced accuracy in a computer implementation (due to the limited number of digits).&lt;ref name="Gade_2010"/&gt; Similarly, arcsine is inaccurate for angles near &amp;minus;{{pi}}/2 and {{pi}}/2.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8781">'''Just another Perl hacker''', or '''JAPH''', typically refers to a [[Perl]] program which prints "Just another Perl hacker," (the comma is [[canon (basic principle)|canon]]ical but is occasionally omitted).  Short JAPH programs are often used as [[signature block|signatures]] in online [[Internet forum|forums]], or as [[T-shirt]] designs.  The phrase or acronym is also occasionally used (without [[Computer programming|code]]) for a signature.

JAPH programs are classically done using extremely [[obfuscated code|obfuscated]] methods, in the spirit of the [[International Obfuscated C Code Contest|Obfuscated C Contest]].  More recently, as the phenomenon has become so well known, the phrase is sometimes used in ordinary examples (without obfuscation).

The idea of using tiny Perl programs which print a signature ''as a signature'' was originated by [[Randal L. Schwartz]], in his postings to the [[newsgroup]] comp.lang.perl.&lt;ref&gt;Randal L. Schwartz in [[Usenet]] message M1HFPVH2JQ.FSF@HALFDOME.HOLDIT.COM explaining the origin of JAPH. Available through  [http://groups.google.com/group/comp.lang.perl.misc/msg/ecc405feeefc120c Google.com]&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the JAPHs below are his.

==Examples==

JAPH program without obfuscation:

&lt;source lang="perl"&gt;
print "Just another Perl hacker,";
&lt;/source&gt;

Embedding JAPH in opaque code:

&lt;source lang="perl"&gt;
$_='987;s/^(\d+)/$1-1/e;$1?eval:print"Just another Perl hacker,"';eval;
&lt;/source&gt;

Decoding JAPH from a transposed [[string literal]]:

&lt;source lang="perl"&gt;
$_="krJhruaesrltre c a cnP,ohet";$_.=$1,print$2while s/(..)(.)//;
&lt;/source&gt;

Printing out JAPH as separate processes:
&lt;source lang="perl"&gt;
for $i (0..4) { if (!fork) {
      $i == 0 or not { $SIG{INT} = sub { print "J" } } or
      $i == 1 or not { $SIG{INT} = sub { print "A" } } or
      $i == 2 or not { $SIG{INT} = sub { print "P" } } or
      $i == 3 or not { $SIG{INT} = sub { print "H" } } ;
      sleep $i; last; } } kill INT =&gt; $$;
&lt;/source&gt;

Appearing as if it does something completely unrelated to printing JAPH:

&lt;source lang="perl"&gt;
$_ = "wftedskaebjgdpjgidbsmnjgc";
tr/a-z/oh, turtleneck Phrase Jar!/; print;
&lt;/source&gt;

Forking processes to print out one letter each in the correct order:&lt;ref&gt;[http://perl.plover.com/obfuscated/ Plover.com]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;source lang="perl"&gt;
@P=split//,".URRUU\c8R";@d=split//,"\nrekcah xinU / lreP rehtona tsuJ";sub p{
@p{"r$p","u$p"}=(P,P);pipe"r$p","u$p";++$p;($q*=2)+=$f=!fork;map{$P=$P[$f^ord
($p{$_})&amp;6];$p{$_}=/ ^$P/ix?$P:close$_}keys%p}p;p;p;p;p;map{$p{$_}=~/^[P.]/&amp;&amp;
close$_}%p;wait until$?;map{/^r/&amp;&amp;&lt;$_&gt;}%p;$_=$d[$q];sleep rand(2)if/\S/;print
&lt;/source&gt;

Using only Perl [[Keyword (computer programming)|keywords]] (no [[punctuation]]):&lt;ref&gt;Originally posted at [http://www.perlmonks.org/?node_id=290607 perlmonks.org] by user blokhead&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kingsley Hall''' is a community centre, at [[Bromley-by-Bow]] in the [[East End of London]]. It dates back to the work of [[Doris Lester]] and [[Muriel Lester]], who had a nursery school in nearby Bruce Road. Their brother, Kingsley Lester, died aged 26 in 1914, leaving money for work in the local area for "educational, social and recreational" purposes, with which the Lesters bought and converted a disused chapel. The current Hall was built on Powis Road, with a stone-laying ceremony taking place on July 14, 1927. An additional Church and community centre has also been built on Parslows Ave. Dagenham. This also holds the Kingsley Hall name and is undergoing redevelopment.

During the [[General Strike]] of 1926, Kingsley Hall became a shelter and soup kitchen for workers. [[Mohandas Gandhi]] stayed in Kingsley Hall in 1931 and the building now houses the [[Gandhi Foundation]]. The room where he stayed has been preserved. In 1935, hunger marchers on the [[Jarrow March]] stayed at the Hall.

In 1965 [[R. D. Laing]] and his associates asked the Lesters for permission to use the Hall as an alternative community for treating people affected by mental health crisis. Kingsley Hall became home to one of the most radical experiments in psychology of the time. The aim of the experiment by the [[Philadelphia Association]] was to create a model for non-restraining, non-drug therapies for those people seriously affected by [[schizophrenia]].
The idea of starting this type of community was an initiative suggested by [[Mary Barnes]] a former nurse and first resident as patient.

The hall was designated a [[listed building|Grade II listed building]] in September 1973.&lt;ref&gt;{{IoE|206183 |accessdate= 9 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History of the Hall ==
===Origins===
In 1912, Doris and Muriel Lester started a Nursery School at numbers 58 and 60 Bruce Road. Children were fed, clothed and cared for at a charge of one [[shilling]] (five pence a day). When mothers could not afford fees, children were sponsored by a network of wealthier supporters. The service was soon expanded to include activities for older groups with the aim to provide for the development of the whole person – the mind, body and spirit – in an environment which brought people together regardless of class, race and religion.

Kingsley Lester died in 1914, leaving what money he had for work in Bow towards "educational, social and recreational" purposes. Doris and [[Muriel Lester]] bought an old chapel on the corner of Eagling Road in 1915, which was then re-decorated and fitted out by local volunteers. It was a "people's house", where friends and neighbours, workmen, factory girls and children of Bow came together for "worship, study, fun and friendship". The premises became known as Kingsley Hall, and operated a Nursery, as well as social events, concerts and adult school. Football, Sunday services and summer holiday schemes were also begun.

During [[World War I]], in the face of criticism, Doris and Muriel remained pacifists. Kingsley Hall ran a soup kitchen and stayed open at night for [[Air Raid Warden]]s. At the end of the war, Doris and Muriel joined a march to the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] demanding that milk be sent to [[Germany]], where people were starving. A German child was adopted by the members of Kingsley Hall who paid for her to stay with a local family for two years.

After the War, Kingsley Hall maintained strong links with the [[Suffragettes]] in east London. Activists campaigned for votes for women in the face of threats. Muriel Lester spoke on street corners and on Sunday mornings in [[Victoria Park, East London|Victoria Park]]. After her talks local people contributed towards maintaining services at Kingsley Hall. Muriel became an [[Alderman]] on the [[Metropolitan Borough of Poplar]] and fought for basic provisions such as milk for children under five.

The Lester's father, Henry Lester, was a shipbuilder. He bought a cottage in [[Loughton]], (then a countryside district of [[Essex]]), to be used as a holiday place by families from Bow. Named after his deceased wife, ''Rachel Cottage'' also served to provide holidays for nursery children.

Enough money was saved to build the Children's House on Bruce Road which was opened by [[H.G. Wells]] in 1923. The foundation stones represent: Vision, Nature, Rhythm and Music; Beauty, Health, Education, Motherhood, Internationalism and Fellowship. The ''Children's House'' continues to be run as a Nursery School.

==Powis Road==
During the [[UK General Strike of 1926|1926 General Strike]], the hall became a shelter and soup kitchen for workers. Larger accommodations were needed as the popularity of Kingsley Hall grew, and a new Kingsley Hall was built on Powis Road, with funds from people in the neighbourhood and donations from wealthy patrons. The architect was [[Charles Cowles Voysey]].

A Stone-laying ceremony took place on July 14, 1927. The following people laid stones representing different aspects.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kingsleyhall.freeuk.com/kingsleyhall.htm The History of Kingsley Hall] URL unavailable 31 July 2018 &lt;/ref&gt;

Kingsley Hall (on Powis Road) was opened on September 15, 1928. The building included residential units or cells, and also had a clubroom and dining room, kitchen, office and a space of worship. 

===Gandhi===
The new building would receive its most famous visitor just a few years after it opened. In 1931 [[Mahatma Gandhi]] accepted an invitation to stay there while on his visit to England. 
[[File:Gandhi planting a tree.jpg|thumb|Gandhi planting a tree outside Kingsley Hall on December 3, 1931. The tree was destroyed in World War II by a flash and was replanted by Lady Attenborough in 1984.]] In 1931, Lylie Valentine was a participant in activities at the hall before she became a worker at the nursery. In her pamphlet: ''Two Sisters and the Cockney Kids'', she recounts the excitement surrounding Gandhi’s stay in the East End:
&lt;blockquote&gt;''The same year (1931), Muriel told us that Mahatma Gandhi (at whose ashram she had stayed in India) was coming over for the Round Table Conference. He had refused to stay at a hotel, but would come if he could live with the working class, so he was to stay at Kingsley Hall....when he arrived, I think all the people in East London waited outside to see him.''
''...besides doing his work with the Government, he spent a lot of time with us. He visited the Nursery School and all the children called him Uncle Gandhi. At six o'clock each morning, after his prayers, he took his walk along the canal, talking to workmen on the way.... There was something about him that always lives with the people.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Gandhi lived at Kingsley Hall for 12 weeks. Stories that he was accompanied by a goat however, were pure press invention. Among Gandhi's visitors were [[Charlie Chaplin]], [[George Bernard Shaw]], the [[Pearly King|Pearly King and Queen]] of east London, many politicians including [[David Lloyd George]] and the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] [[Cosmo Gordon Lang]]. Muriel Lester later accompanied Mahatma Gandhi on his tour of earthquake-shaken regions in Bihar on his anti-untouchability tour during 1934.

===Jarrow March===
In 1935 [[Ellen Wilkinson]] led the [[Jarrow March]] to London, and some of the men were put up at Kingsley Hall. It was the poor helping the poor. They collected their pennies and opened the jumble store for them. Muriel Lester visited the Far East, USA, China, Japan and India to report to the League of Nations on drug investigations in the regions. Muriel Lester retired from full-time work in 1958 and in 1963 she became a ''Freeman of the Borough of Poplar'' on her eightieth birthday. Muriel Lester died in 1967.

===R.D. Laing and Kingsley Hall===

Following World War II, with the welfare state having undertaken much of the work advocated by the Lester sisters, Kingsley Hall continued on a quieter note as a youth hostel and community activity centre.

In 1965 [[R. D. Laing]] and his colleagues asked the Lesters for use of the Hall as a community for themselves and people in a state of psychosis. As a result Kingsley Hall became home to the [[Philadelphia Association]] and one of the most radical experiments in psychiatry.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.philadelphia-association.co.uk/Kingsley-Hall.html The Philadelphia Association: Kingsley Hall] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509060104/http://www.philadelphia-association.co.uk/Kingsley-Hall.html |date=2008-05-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Based on the notion that psychosis, a state of reality akin to living in a waking dream, is not an illness simply to be eliminated through the electric shocks favoured in the Western tradition of the time but, as in other cultures, a state of trance which could even be valued as mystical or Shamanistic, it sought to allow schizophrenic people the space to explore their madness and internal chaos.&lt;ref&gt;[http://laingsociety.org/colloquia/inperson/fhuxley.htm The Liberating Shaman of Kingsley Hall]&lt;/ref&gt; Residents (in the grip of psychosis) were often treated with kindness and respect with sincere efforts to alleviate their suffering.

One notable resident of this experiment was [[Mary Barnes]]. Along with resident psychiatrist [[Joseph Berke]], Mary later went on to write ''Two Accounts of a Journey Through Madness'', describing her stay at Kingsley Hall and use of her mental condition as a vehicle for painting and creative expression. Her account became famous in the 1970s when it was used as the basis for the play ''Mary Barnes'' by [[David_Edgar_(playwright)|David Edgar]]. Another notable resident was the renowned Norwegian author [[Axel Jensen]].

The activities of residents in the "no-holds barred" experiment made the local community largely hostile to the project, and there were regular reports of harassment. After five years (from 1965 to 1970) the project was wound up and Kingsley Hall was boarded up. During the seventies it was severely damaged.

==Recent history==

[[Image:Kingsley Hall London E3.jpg|right|thumb|Kingsley Hall]]

In the 1980s Kingsley Hall was one of the sets used in the film ''[[Gandhi (film)|Gandhi]]''. During the filming [[Richard Attenborough]] united with the Kingsley Hall Action Group to raise enough funds to carry out an extensive refurbishing. Many of the local community contributed their skills and commitment to bring Kingsley Hall back into a usable community centre.

Kingsley Hall was reopened 2 March  1985 with events in the week preceding, and has since gone on to be used for activities ranging from youth groups, holiday outings or arts and photography workshops, for advice surgeries, wedding functions and educational projects. It also houses the office of the Gandhi Foundation, which pursues interests of peace internationally, in the tradition of its namesake.

In 1995, The Hall suffered two major burglaries when vandals broke in and burnt down the offices. The committed staff and volunteers were devastated by this destruction, but continued to run youth groups, advice sessions, clubs and meetings. The management interprets its remit as serving the local community and the cause of international peace and to do so in exciting and innovatory ways.

The [[law]] of [[South America]] is one of the most unified in the world. All countries can be said to follow civil law systems, although recent developments in the [[law of Brazil]] suggest a move towards the ''[[stare decisis]]'' doctrine. Moreover, all countries have recently signed up to the [[Union of South American Nations]] agreement, which aims to establish a system of supra-national law along the lines of the [[European Union]].

'''''Linguistic Imperialism''''' is a book written by [[Robert Phillipson]], research professor at [[Copenhagen Business School]]'s Department of English, published in 1992 by [[Oxford University Press]].

In ''Linguistic Imperialism'', Phillipson argues that [[Western world|Western countries]] have used [[English language|English]] as a tool of [[imperialism]] to dominate [[Colonialism|colonies and former colonies]].  He further explores the ideologies transmitted through the English language.

The book was followed by ''Linguistic Imperialism Continued'', first published by [[Routledge]] in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Waters |first=Alan |title=Linguistic Imperialism Continued |url=http://eltj.oxfordjournals.org/content/67/1/126.extract |journal=ELT

[[File:MerchantMarkThomasHortonOfIlford.png|thumb|right|Merchant's mark of Thomas Horton (d.1530), wool merchant of Iford, Wiltshire, used on Wiltshire English woollens sent to Flanders. Engraved on a monumental brass ''circa'' 1520 in Bradford-on-Avon Church]]
A '''merchant's mark''' is an emblem or device adopted by a merchant, and placed on goods or produce sold by him in order to keep track of them, or as a sign of authentication. It may also be used as a mark of identity in other contexts.

==History==
Merchants' marks are as old as the sealings of the third millennium BCE found in [[Sumer]] that originated in the [[Indus Valley]].&lt;ref&gt;Seals were used to make impressions in wet clay as a means of sealing shipments of goods.  D. H. Kelley and B. Wells, "Recent Progress in Understanding the Indus Script", ''Review of Archaeology.'' Vol. 16, No. 1 : 15-23.(1995).&lt;/ref&gt;  Impressions of cloth, strings and other packing material on the reverse of tags with seal impressions indicate that the Harappan seals were used to control economic administration and trade.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.harappa.com/script/indusscript.html  Asko Parpola, "Study of the Indus Script", p. 52. Paper read at the 50th ICES Tokyo Session on 19 May 2005 in Tokyo.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100420012826/http://www.harappa.com/script/indusscript.html |date=20 April 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.harappa.com/seal/7.html  Geoffrey Cook, "A Unicorn Seal", ''The Ancient Indus Civilization'' (on line).]&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Amphora]]e from the [[Roman Empire]] can sometimes be traced to their sources from the inscriptions on their handles.  Commercial inscriptions in [[Latin]], known as [[Titulus pictus|Tituli picti]], appear on Roman containers used for [[trade]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=5x5AoxAYBsgC&amp;pg=PA106&amp;lpg=PA106&amp;dq=titulus+pictus&amp;source=web&amp;ots=QKKuO8MhJA&amp;sig=6a8A3voRh9fy4oVYzxGa0ed9KW4#PPA106,M1  J. Theodore Peña, ''Roman Pottery in the Archaeological Record,'' p. 106. Cambridge U. Press (2007)] {{ISBN|0-521-86541-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Symbolic merchants' marks continued to be used by [[artisan]]s and [[townspeople]] of the [[medieval]] and [[early modern]] eras&lt;ref&gt;Sylvia L. Thrupp, ''The Merchant Class of Medieval London (1300-1500).'' U. Chicago (1948).&lt;/ref&gt; to identify themselves and authenticate their goods.  These distinctive and easily recognizable marks often appeared in their [[Seal (device)|seals]]&lt;ref&gt;http://medievalwriting.50megs.com/decoration/seal6.htm Medieval Writing&lt;/ref&gt; on documents and on products made for sale.  They are often found on [[headstone]]s and in works of [[stained glass]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cvma.ac.uk/content/books/browne/browne2.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-11-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061008190449/http://www.cvma.ac.uk/content/books/browne/browne2.htm |archivedate=8 October 2006 |df=dmy-all }} Corpus Vitrearum Medii Aevi - Browne's Chapel&lt;/ref&gt; brass&lt;ref&gt;http://medievalwriting.50megs.com/decoration/seal6.htm| Medieval Writing&lt;/ref&gt; and stone, serving in place of [[heraldic]] imagery, which could not be used by the [[middle class]]es.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.houseofnames.com/xq/asp/keyword.merchant%27s+mark/qx/symbolism_details.htm "merchant's mark", House of Names]&lt;/ref&gt;  They were the precursors of [[hallmark]]s, [[printer's mark]]s&lt;ref&gt;http://spencer.lib.ku.edu/sc/ptrsmark.shtml University of Kansas Libraries. Kenneth Specer Research Library. Special Collections.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[trademark]]s.

To manage the risks of piracy or shipwreck, merchants often consigned a cargo to several vessels or caravans; a mark on a bale established legal ownership and avoided confusion.  Early travellers, voyagers and merchants displayed their merchant's marks as well to ward off evil.   Adventurous travellers and sailors ascribed the terrors and perils of their life to the wrath of the [[Devil]].  To counter these dangers merchants employed all sorts of religious and magical means to place their caravans, ships and merchandise under the protection of God and His Saints.

[[Image:The Variety of 4 Marks.jpg|thumb|right|The Mystical Sign of Four, also called the "Staff of Mercury".]]

One such symbol combined the mystical "Sign of Four" with the merchant's name or initials.  The "Sign of Four"&lt;ref&gt;D. Christison, "The Carvings and Inscriptions on the Kirkyard Monuments of the Scottish Lowlands; particularly in Perth, Fife, Angus, Mearns, and Lothian," in ''Proceedings of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland,'' Volume 36 (1901-02): Fig. 114, p. 117.&lt;/ref&gt; was an outgrowth of an ancient symbol adopted by the Romans and by Christianity, [[Chi Rho]] (XP), standing for the first two letters of Christus in Greek letters; this was simplified to a reversed "4" in Medieval times.  The evolution of this symbol is shown in M. J. Shah's  article.&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20091027143019/http://www.geocities.com/mjshah.geo/scinde/scinde.html  Scinde District Dawks - The Premier Stamps of Asia&lt;/ref&gt; The "Sign of Four" is called the "Staff of Mercury" ([[Caduceus]]) in German and Scandinavian literature on house marks.&lt;ref&gt;C. G. Homeyer: ''Die Haus- und Hofmarken'', [[Berlin]] 1870, [http://www.labarum.se/media/gudstecken.pdf Tuve Skånberg: Glömda gudstecken.

The [[joint stock company]] or limited liability company was another way to reduce a merchant's risks of loss of ships and merchandise from dangerous voyages and travel.  By [[royal charter]] a monopoly was assured and a merchant's personal liability was limited to the amount of his own investment.  If a voyage succeeded the gains accrued to all of the investors in proportion to their invested capital shares.  Modern institutions, corporations and trademarks, find some of their origins in these symbolic and legal devices for limiting physical and pecuniary [[risks]].

== The East India Company's Merchant's Mark ==
[[Image:EIC Coin 1791 Half Pice.jpg|thumb|right|Symbols on East India Company Coin: 1791 Half Pice]]
[[image:Symbols on a Blue Scinde Dawk.jpg|right|thumb|Symbols on a Blue Scinde Dawk postage stamp (1852)]]

When the [[British East India Company|East India Company]] was chartered by [[Elizabeth I]], Queen of England in 1600 it was still customary for each merchant or [[Company of Merchant Adventurers of London|Company of Merchant Adventurers]] to have a distinguishing mark which included the "Sign of Four" and served as a trademark.  The East India Company's mark was made up from a '+', a '4' and the initials EIC.

This mark forms the central emblem displayed on the [[Scinde Dawk]] postage stamps.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20091027143019/http://www.geocities.com/mjshah.geo/scinde/scinde.html  "Scinde District Dawks - The Premier Stamps of Asia", excerpted by M. J. Shah from Manik Jain and S.B. Kothari, '''The Silver Key to The Golden Treasure of Indian Philately.''']&lt;/ref&gt; Also, it was a central motif of the East India Company's coinage.&lt;ref&gt;East India Company coin 1791, half pice, as illustrated.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6112">'''Minimum distance estimation (MDE)''' is a statistical method for fitting a mathematical model to data, usually the [[Empirical distribution function|empirical distribution]].

==Definition==
Let &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle X_1,\ldots,X_n&lt;/math&gt; be an [[Independent and identically-distributed random variables|independent and identically distributed]] (iid) [[Random variable|random]] [[Random sample|sample]] from a [[Statistical population|population]] with [[Cumulative distribution function|distribution]] &lt;math&gt;F(x;\theta)\colon \theta\in\Theta&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Theta\subseteq\mathbb{R}^k (k\geq 1)&lt;/math&gt;.

Let &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle F_n(x)&lt;/math&gt; be the [[empirical distribution function]] based on the sample.

Let &lt;math&gt;\hat{\theta}&lt;/math&gt; be an [[estimator]] for &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \theta&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;F(x;\hat{\theta})&lt;/math&gt; is an estimator for &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle F(x;\theta)&lt;/math&gt;.

Let &lt;math&gt;d[\cdot,\cdot]&lt;/math&gt; be a [[Functional (mathematics)|functional]] returning some measure of [[Distance#General_case|"distance"]] between the two [[Dependent and independent variables#Mathematics|arguments]]. The functional &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle d&lt;/math&gt; is also called the criterion function.

If there exists a &lt;math&gt;\hat{\theta}\in\Theta&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;d[F(x;\hat{\theta}),F_n(x)]=\inf\{d[F(x;\theta),F_n(x)]; \theta\in\Theta\}&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;\hat{\theta}&lt;/math&gt; is called the '''minimum distance estimate''' of &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \theta&lt;/math&gt;.

==Statistics used in estimation==

Most theoretical studies of minimum distance estimation, and most applications, make use of "distance" measures which underlie already-established [[goodness of fit]] tests: the test statistic used in one of these tests is used as the distance measure to be minimised. Below are some examples of statistical tests that have been used for minimum distance estimation.

===Chi-square criterion===

The [[Pearson's chi-square test|chi-square test]] uses as its criterion the sum, over predefined groups, of the squared difference between the increases of the empirical distribution and the estimated distribution, weighted by the increase in the estimate for that group.

===Cramér–von Mises criterion===

The [[Cramér–von Mises criterion]] uses the integral of the squared difference between the empirical and the estimated distribution functions {{harv|Parr|Schucany|1980|p=616}}.

===Kolmogorov–Smirnov criterion===

The [[Kolmogorov–Smirnov test]] uses the [[supremum]] of the [[absolute difference]] between the empirical and the estimated distribution functions {{harv|Parr|Schucany|1980|p=616}}.

===Anderson–Darling criterion===

The [[Anderson–Darling test]] is similar to the Cramér–von Mises criterion except that the integral is of a weighted version of the squared difference, where the weighting relates the variance of the empirical distribution function {{harv|Parr|Schucany|1980|p=616}}.

==Theoretical results==

The theory of minimum distance estimation is related to that for the asymptotic distribution of the corresponding statistical [[goodness of fit]] tests. Often the cases of the [[Cramér–von Mises criterion]], the [[Kolmogorov–Smirnov test]] and the [[Anderson–Darling test]] are treated simultaneously by treating them as special cases of a more general formulation of a distance measure. Examples of the theoretical results that are available are: [[Consistency (statistics)|consistency]] of the parameter estimates; the asymptotic covariance matrices of the parameter estimates.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4334">[[File:Constructing nerve.png|thumb|Constructing the nerve of an open good cover containing 3 sets in the plane.]]

In [[topology]], the '''nerve of an open covering''' is a construction of an [[abstract simplicial complex]] from an [[Cover (topology)#open cover|open covering]] of a [[topological space]] ''X'' that captures many of the interesting topological properties in an algorithmic or combinatorial way. It was introduced by [[Pavel Alexandrov]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Aleksandroff|first=P. S.|author-link=Pavel Alexandrov| title=Über den allgemeinen Dimensionsbegriff und seine Beziehungen zur elementaren geometrischen Anschauung |journal=[[Mathematische Annalen]]|volume=98 |year=1928| pages=617–635|doi=   10.1007/BF01451612}}&lt;/ref&gt; and now has many variants and generalisations, among them the Čech nerve of a cover, which in turn is generalised by [[hypercovering|hypercoverings]].


==Alexandrov's definition==
Given an [[index set]] ''I'', and [[open set]]s ''U&lt;sub&gt;i''&lt;/sub&gt; contained in ''X'', the ''nerve'' ''N'' is the set of finite subsets of ''I'' defined as follows:
* a finite set ''J'' ⊆ ''I'' belongs to ''N'' if and only if the intersection of the ''U&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' whose subindices are in ''J'' is non-empty,
::&lt;math&gt;\bigcap_{j\in J}U_j \neq \varnothing.&lt;/math&gt;

Obviously, if ''J'' belongs to ''N'', then any of its subsets is also in ''N''. Therefore ''N'' is an abstract simplicial complex.

In general, the complex ''N'' need not reflect the topology of ''X'' accurately. For example we can cover any ''n''-sphere with two contractible sets ''U'' and ''V'', in such a way that ''N'' is an [[Abstract simplicial complex|abstract 1-simplex]]. However, if we also insist that the open sets corresponding to every [[Intersection (set theory)|intersection]] indexed by a set in ''N'' are also [[contractible space|contractible]], the situation changes. In particular, the nerve lemma states that if &lt;math&gt;\mathcal U = \{U_i\}_{i\in I}&lt;/math&gt; is a [[good cover]], in that for each &lt;math&gt;\sigma\subset I&lt;/math&gt;, the set &lt;math&gt;\bigcap_{i\in \sigma} U_i&lt;/math&gt; is contractible if it is nonempty, then the nerve &lt;math&gt;N(\mathcal U)&lt;/math&gt; is homotopy equivalent to &lt;math&gt;\bigcup_{i\in I} U_i&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/899283974|title=Elementary applied topology|last=1969-|first=Ghrist, Robert W.,|isbn=9781502880857|edition=Edition 1.0|location=[United States]|oclc=899283974}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

This means for instance that a circle covered by three open arcs, intersecting in pairs in one arc, is modelled by a homeomorphic complex, the [[geometrical realization]] of ''N''.

==The Čech nerve==
Given an open cover &lt;math&gt;\mathcal U=\{U_i\}&lt;/math&gt; of a topological space &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, or more generally a cover in a site, we can regard the pairwise [[Pullback_(category_theory)|fibre products]] &lt;math&gt;U_{ij}=U_i\times_XU_j&lt;/math&gt;, which in the case of a topological space is precisely the intersection &lt;math&gt;U_i\cap U_j&lt;/math&gt;. The collection of all such intersections can be referred to as &lt;math&gt;\mathcal U\times_X\mathcal U&lt;/math&gt; and the triple intersections as &lt;math&gt;\mathcal U\times_X\mathcal U\times_X\mathcal U&lt;/math&gt;. By considering the natural maps &lt;math&gt;U_{ij}\to U_i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;U_i\to U_{ii}&lt;/math&gt;, we can construct a simplicial object &lt;math&gt;C(\mathcal U)_\bullet&lt;/math&gt; defined by &lt;math&gt;C(\mathcal U)_n=\mathcal U\times_X\cdots\times_X\mathcal U&lt;/math&gt;, n-fold fibre product. This is the '''Čech nerve''', and by taking connected components we get a simplicial set, which we can realise topologically: &lt;math&gt;|C(\pi_0(\mathcal U))|&lt;/math&gt;. If the covering and the space are sufficiently nice, for instance if &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is compact and all intersections of sets in the cover are contractible or empty, then this space is weakly equivalent to &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;. This is known as ''the nerve theorem''.

The '''Nobel Prize effect''' is an observation about the adverse effects of winning the [[Nobel Prize]] on laureates and their careers. These effects include reduced productivity, constraints in areas of work, and public perception of expertise in areas unrelated to the laureate's work. The term '''Nobel effect''' is also used in those contexts, as well as in the context of the winner's longevity, and influence on international law in the case of the [[Nobel Peace Prize]].

==Productivity==
The definition of the "Nobel Prize effect" most attributed to [[Richard Hamming]] describes the effect as a reduction in productivity, making it hard for a scientist to work on small problems after winning the prize. During a speech at a seminar, Hamming described a scene at the Nobel awards ceremony as follows:{{quote|... all three winners got up and made speeches. The third one, [[Walter Houser Brattain|Brattain]], practically with tears in his eyes, said, "I know about this Nobel-Prize effect and I am not going to let it affect me; I am going to remain good old Walter Brattain." Well I said to myself, "That is nice." But in a few weeks I saw it was affecting him. Now he could only work on great problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Richard Hamming |title=You and Your Research |publisher=Bell Communications Research Colloquium Seminar |url=http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~robins/YouAndYourResearch.html |date=7 March 1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Public perception==
The Nobel Prize effect is also described as a consequence of public perception of the [[Nobel laureate]], magnified by the worldwide exposure the winner experiences. One example is for the Nobel laureate to be treated with reverence due to perception that the laureate has authoritative knowledge about any subject outside the field in which he or she won the prize. Nobel Laureate [[Klaus von Klitzing]] describes the effect as a personal burden, because other people have a tendency to believe that a Nobel Prize winner's knowledge extends to all areas. At the same time, he acknowledges that this is also a benefit, because people in positions of authority will pay attention to the views of Nobel laureates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Mike Donachie |title=Metro's guide to quantum physics: Nobel Prize winner explains all during London visit |newspaper=Metro London |date=22 September 2013 |url=http://metronews.ca/news/london/802741/metros-guide-to-quantum-physics-nobel-prize-winner-explains-all-during-london-visit/ |quote=The Nobel Prize effect: Dr. Klaus von Klitzing is treated like a rock star as he meets staff and students at Western University.}}&lt;/ref&gt; As physicist [[Hubert Curien]] described the phenomenon in a [[Natural Environment Research Council]] lecture:
{{quote|If someone wins the Nobel prize, he is immediately pounced upon by all kinds of people who ask him all kinds of questions on all kinds of subjects which he knows nothing about. It is very difficult to resist the temptation to reply&amp;nbsp;– to give any old answer on subjects which he knows nothing about. We have seen colleagues who have won a Nobel prize talking nonsense on such and such a political question, on which they really have no knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Curien, Hubert |title=The contribution of space research to knowledge and control of the environment: 1991 NERC annual lecture |journal=NERC News |volume=20 |pages=16–17 |year=1992 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=6z9MAAAAYAAJ&amp;q=%22If+someone+wins+the+nobel+prize%22}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Another example of the effect of new public perception is when the works of the Nobel Laureate suddenly become popular and in demand due to the fame that the Nobel Prize confers on the winner. Canadian author [[Alice Munro]], winner of the 2013 [[Nobel Prize in Literature]], suddenly found herself with a Chinese audience with such strong demands for her works that they quickly sold out, and two publishers in China became embroiled in a dispute over publication rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Bai Shi |title=The Nobel Prize Effect |url=http://www.bjreview.com.cn/culture/txt/2013-11/11/content_577153.htm |newspaper=Beijing Review |date=14 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Perception among colleagues in the same discipline was thought to have a measurable effect on how often the Nobel laureate's works are cited before and after winning the prize. While a simple comparison of citation counts before and after the prize does suggest an impact, a study using matched synthetic control group in the analysis suggest that there is no such effect on either citation impact or related chain reactions of citations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Rudolf Farys, Tobias Wolbring |date=26 May 2017 |title=Matched control groups for modeling events in citation data: An illustration of nobel prize effects in citation networks |journal=Journal of the Association for Information Science and Technology |volume=68 |issue=9 |pages=2201–2210 |doi=10.1002/asi.23802}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nobel Peace Prize==
In addition to the life-changing effects of winning a Nobel prize, an alternative meaning exists for the Nobel effect in the context of the [[Nobel Peace Prize]]. In this context, legal scholars have argued whether Nobel Peace Prize laureates have, as a result of winning the Prize, influenced the shaping of new norms in international law and international relations,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Roger P Alford |title=The Nobel Effect: Nobel Peace Prize Laureates as International Norm Entrepreneurs |year=2008 |journal=Notre Dame Law School Scholarly Works |number=406 |url=http://scholarship.law.nd.edu/law_faculty_scholarship/406}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |authors=Gregory Gordon, Anne Kjelling |title=Response to Roger Alford's The Nobel Effect: Nobel Peace Prize Laureates as International Norm Entrepreneurs |date=15 October 2008 |publisher=Opinio Juris |url=http://opiniojuris.org/2008/10/15/response-to-roger-alfords-the-nobel-effect-nobel-peace-prize-laureates-as-international-norm-entrepreneurs/}}&lt;/ref&gt; and suggesting that the Peace Prize can be a significant factor in encouraging peacemaking among individuals worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis|author= Lukasz Swiatek |title=Lights, Camera, Accolade: Towards and Understanding of the Nature and Impacts of the Nobel Peace Prize |url=http://hdl.handle.net/2123/7201 |year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Longevity==
An analysis of birth data on 19th century science Nobel Prize winners estimated that winning the Nobel Prize correlated with one or two years of additional longevity for the recipient, compared to being merely nominated for the prize.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Mortality and immortality: The Nobel Prize as an experiment into the effect of status upon longevity |authors=Matthew D.Rablen, Andrew J.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2194">'''Open individualism''' is the view in the philosophy of personal identity, according to which there exists only one [[Identity (philosophy)|numerically identical]] subject, which is everyone at all times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Kolak | first = Daniel | title = I Am You: The Metaphysical Foundations for Global Ethics | publisher = Springer | year = 2005 | isbn = 1-4020-2999-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a theoretical solution for the question of [[personal identity]], being contrasted with empty individualism, the view that personal identities correspond to a fixed pattern that instantaneously disappears with the passage of time, and with closed individualism, the common view that personal identities are particular to subjects and yet survive time.

The term was coined by philosopher [[Daniel Kolak]], though this view has been described at least since the time of the [[Upanishads]], in the late [[Bronze Age]]. Its sentence "[[Tat tvam asi]]," meaning "You are that," is an example. Notable people having expressed similar views (in various forms) include the [[Sufism|Sufi]] thinker Aziz al-Nasafi, [[Averroes]], German philosopher [[Arthur Schopenhauer]], Indian mystic [[Meher Baba]], [[Alan Watts]], as well as renowned physicists [[Erwin Schrödinger]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://whatislife.stanford.edu/LoCo_files/What-is-Life.pdf |title=What is life? |last=Schrödinger |first=Erwin |orig-year=First published 1944 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141113143420/http://whatislife.stanford.edu/LoCo_files/What-is-Life.pdf |archive-date=November 13, 2014 |dead-url=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Freeman Dyson]], and [[Fred Hoyle]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10677">The '''Out of Asia theory''' was a [[scientific theory]] which contended that [[modern humans]] first arose in [[Asia]]. Most [[anthropologists]] until the mid 20th century preferred Asia, over Africa, as the continent where the first [[hominids]] evolved.&lt;ref&gt;Marianne Sommer ''Bones and ochre: the afterlife of the red lady of Paviland'' Harvard University Press, 2008, p. 283 {{ISBN|978-0674024991}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[recent African origin of modern humans]] ("Out of Africa") theory is currently supported by more data.

== History ==

Because of the rise of evolutionary thought in the late 19th century the out of Asia theory gained many new proponents, many of whom believed that the [[Transitional fossil#Missing links|missing link]] would be found in Asia. Scientists such as [[Ernst Haeckel]], [[Eugene Dubois]], [[Henry Fairfield Osborn]] and [[Roy Chapman Andrews]] all thought Asia was where the major events of [[evolution]] had occurred.

Ernst Haeckel, the German [[evolutionary biologist]], believed that [[Hindustan]] (South Asia) was the actual location where the first humans had evolved.  Haeckel argued that humans were closely related to the primates of Southeast Asia and rejected Darwin's hypothesis of [[Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;Douglas Palmer, ''Prehistoric past: The four billion year history of life on earth'', University of California Press; 1 edition, 2006, p. 43 {{ISBN|978-0520248274}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brian Regal ''Human evolution, a guide to the debates'', [[ABC-CLIO]], 2004, p. 73-75 {{ISBN|978-1851094189}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Haeckel later claimed that the missing link was to be found on the [[lost continent of Lemuria]] located in the [[Indian Ocean]].  He believed that Lemuria was the home of the first humans, that Asia was the home of many of the earliest [[primates]], and thus Asia was the cradle of hominin evolution.  Haeckel also claimed that Lemuria connected Asia and Africa which allowed the migration of humans to the rest of the world.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher J Norton, David R Braun. ''Asian Paleoanthropology: From Africa to China and beyond'', Springer; 1st Edition, 2010, p. 4 {{ISBN|978-9048190935}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mario A. Di Gregorio, ''From here to Eternity: Ernst Haeckel and the scientific faith'', [[Vandenhoeck &amp; Ruprecht]], 2005  p. 480 {{ISBN|978-3525569726}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Eugène Dubois]], a Dutch [[paleoanthropologist]] and proponent of the out of Asia theory, discovered the skeletal remains of the first representative ''[[Homo erectus]]'' found in Java in 1891 on the banks of [[Solo River]], [[East Java]], [[Indonesia]]. The find later became known as [[Java man]].&lt;ref&gt;Bert Theunissen, ''Eugène Dubois and the ape-men from Java: The history of the first missing link and its discoverer'', Springer; 1 edition, 1988, {{ISBN|978-1556080814}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Peking Man Skull (replica) presented at Paleozoological Museum of China.jpg|thumb|Replica of ''Homo erectus'' ("Peking man") skull from China.]]

Later, the discovery of [[Peking man]] persuaded anthropologists up until the 1930s that Asia was most likely the cradle of the human species.&lt;ref&gt;Aedeen Cremin, ''The World Encyclopedia of Archaeology: The World's Most Significant Sites and Cultural Treasures'', Firefly Books, 2007, {{ISBN|978-1554073115}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[William Boyd Dawkins]] wrote that the tropical region of Asia was "the probable birthplace of the human race". The British anthropologist [[Alfred Cort Haddon]] wrote "There is reason to believe that mankind did not originate in Africa; but that all the main races in that continent reached it from Southern Asia".&lt;ref&gt;Raymond Corbey, [[Wil Roebroeks]]. ''Studying Human Origins: disciplinary history and epistemology'', Amsterdam University Press; 1 edition, 2001, p. 48 {{ISBN|978-9053564646}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Apart from Eugene Dubois, very few of the early human origin theorists actually visited Asia to see if their ideas were valid or not. This changed in the 1920s as a well-funded expedition was carried out in Asia called '''The Central Asiatic Expeditions'''.  The expedition, led by Roy Chapman Andrews, visited parts of Central Asia including [[China]] and [[Mongolia]] to search for the origins of humankind.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Expeditions|first=Central Asiatic|last2=Chapman,|first2=Andrews, Roy|last3=Diller,|first3=Matthew, William|date=2000-01-01|title=Central Asiatic Expeditions of the American Museum of Natural History, under the leadership of Roy Chapman Andrews :|url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/44810#page/8/mode/1up|volume=1918-1925}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Paleontologists who believed humans originated in Asia also include [[Johan Gunnar Andersson]], [[Otto Zdansky]] and [[Walter W. Granger]]. All three of these scientists were known for visiting China and for their work and discoveries by excavating the sites at [[Zhoukoudian]] that yielded remains of so-called [[Peking man]] (''Homo erectus pekinensis''). Further funding for the excavations was carried out by [[Davidson Black]] a key proponent of the out of Asia theory. Because of the finds in Zhoukoudian, such as Peking Man, the focus of paleoanthropological research moved entirely to Asia, up until 1930.&lt;ref&gt;Raymond Corbey, Wil Roebroeks. ''Studying Human Origins: disciplinary history and epistemology'', p. 48&lt;/ref&gt;

The explorer [[Roy Chapman Andrews]] along with [[Henry Fairfield Osborn]] led several expeditions to North China and Mongolia from 1922 to 1928 known as the "Central Asiatic Expeditions" setting out to try to find the earliest human remains in Asia, however Andrews and his team found many other finds, such as [[dinosaur]] bones and fossil mammals and most notably the first known dinosaur nests full of eggs. Andrews' main account of these expeditions can be found in his book ''The New Conquest of Central Asia''.&lt;ref&gt;''Horns, tusks, and flippers: the evolution of hoofed mammals'', [[Donald R. Prothero]], [[Robert M. Schoch]] p. 119, also see ''Men and dinosaurs: the search in field and laboratory'', [[Edwin Harris Colbert]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In Andrews' 1926 book ''On the Trail of the Ancient Man'', Henry Fairfield Osborn noted in the preface that the birthplace of modern humans would be found in Asia and that he had predicted it decades earlier even before the Asiatic expeditions were carried out. Another key proponent of the out of Asia theory of this era was [[William Diller Matthew]] who also took part in the Central Asiatic expeditions; Matthew was well known for his deeply influential 1915 article "Climate and evolution".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1749-6632.1914.tb55346.x |last=Matthew |first=W. D. |year=1915 |title=Climate and Evolution |journal=[[Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences]] |volume=24 |issue=1 |pages=171–318 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Matthew's theory was that climate change was how organisms came to live where we find them today in opposition to the theory of [[continental drift]]. His basic premise was that cyclical changes in global climate along with the prevailing tendency for mammals to disperse from north to south account for the odd geographic patterns of living mammals, he believed that humans and many other groups of modern mammals first evolved in the northern areas of the globe, especially central Asia because of the shifting climatic circumstances, Matthew firmly placed hominid origins in central Asia as he claimed that the high plateaux of [[Tibet]] was the forcing ground of mammalian evolution.&lt;ref&gt;Raymond Corbey, Wil Roebroeks. ''Studying human origins, disciplinary history and epistemology'', p. 48&lt;/ref&gt;

Later defenders of the out of Asia theory included Henry Fairfield Osborn, [[Davidson Black]], and William King Gregory. [[Henry Fairfield Osborn]] was best known for his [[Dawn Man theory]] of human origins which he wrote would be found in Tibet and Mongolia. Osborn firmly believed that Asia had been the cradle of humankind.&lt;ref&gt;[[K. Christopher Beard]], ''The Hunt for the Dawn Monkey: Unearthing the Origins of Monkeys, Apes, and Humans'', University of California Press; 1 edition, 2004 {{ISBN|0520233697}}&lt;/ref&gt; Davidson Black writing a paper in 1925 titled ''Asia and the dispersal of primates'' wrote that the origins of man were to be found in Tibet, British India, the [[Yung-Ling]], and the [[Tarim Basin of China]]. His last paper published in 1934 before his death argued for human origins in an Eastern Asian context. [[William King Gregory]] also wrote that the [[Tarim Desert]] is the most likely place for human origins.&lt;ref&gt;''Studying human origins, disciplinary history and epistemology'', Raymond Corbey, Wil Roebroeks, p. 49&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gustav Heinrich Ralph von Koenigswald|Von Koenigswald]] who found the first ''[[Gigantopithecus]]'' tooth in [[Hong Kong]] in 1935, continued to support the out of Asia theory.&lt;ref&gt;Schmalzer, p. 252&lt;/ref&gt;

==Decline==

The out of Asia theory later fell into decline, one of the reasons was because [[Franz Weidenreich]] merged the Asia hypothesis into the [[multiregional origin of modern humans]], extending many other regions into his theory from the Old World with [[gene flow]] between various populations which influenced many anthropologists of the time.&lt;ref&gt;Sigrid Schmalzer ''The people's Peking man, popular science and human identity in twentieth-century China'' University Of Chicago Press, 2008, p. 252 {{ISBN|978-0226738604}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Franz Weidenreich ''Apes, Giants, and Man'' Univ of Chicago Pr, 1946 {{ISBN|978-0226881478}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The last support for the out of Asia theory was due to the finds of fossils such as the ''[[Dryopithecus]]'' and ''[[Ramapithecus]]'' in Eurasia up until the early 1980s. One of the last advocates of the out of Asia theory was [[Jia Lanpo]] who argued that the cradle of humanity had been in Southwest China, up until his death in 2001. Scholar Sigrid Schmalzer in her book ''The People's Peking man'' claims the only modern advocates of the out of Asia theory have their beliefs firmly rooted in [[Chinese Nationalism]].&lt;ref&gt;Schmalzer pp. 246-286&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recent revival==
There are still claims in favor of Out of Asia from modern [[molecular genetics]] research.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yuan|first=Dejian|last2=Lei|first2=Xiaoyun|last3=Gui|first3=Yuanyuan|last4=Zhu|first4=Zuobin|last5=Wang|first5=Dapeng|last6=Yu|first6=Jun|last7=Huang|first7=Shi|date=2018-05-01|title=Modern human origins: multiregional evolution of autosomes and East Asia origin of Y and mtDNA|url=https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/05/01/101410|journal=bioRxiv|language=en|pages=101410|doi=10.1101/101410}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3528">'''''Pacta sunt servanda''''' ([[Latin]] for "agreements must be kept"&lt;ref&gt;Black's Law Dictionary (8th ed. 2004)&lt;/ref&gt;), a [[Brocard (law)|brocard]], is a basic principle of [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]], [[canon law]], and [[international law]].

In its most common sense, the principle refers to private [[contract]]s, stressing that contained [[clause]]s are [[law]] between the parties, and implies that nonfulfillment of respective obligations is a breach of the pact.
== Civil law ==
In civil law jurisdictions this principle is related to the general principle of correct behavior in commercial practice – including the assumption of ''[[good faith]]'' – is a requirement for the efficacy of the whole system, so the eventual disorder is sometimes punished by the law of some systems even without any direct penalty incurred by any of the parties.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}} However, common law jurisdictions usually do not have the principle of good faith in commercial contracts, therefore it is inappropriate to state that pacta sunt servanda includes the principle of good faith.
== International law ==
With reference to international agreements, "every [[treaty]] in force is binding upon the parties to it and must be performed by them in [[good faith]]."&lt;ref&gt;From the [[Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties]], signed at Vienna on May 23, 1969, entered into force on January 27, 1980, art. 26, and the [[Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties between States and International Organizations or between International Organizations]], signed at Vienna on March 21, 1986, ''not yet entered into force'', art. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Pacta sunt servanda'' is related to good faith, while pacta sunt servanda does not equate with good faith {{Clarify|date=March 2018}}. This entitles [[State (polity)|states]] to require that obligations be respected and to rely upon the obligations being respected. This good faith basis of treaties implies that a party to the treaty cannot invoke provisions of its [[Municipal law|municipal (domestic) law]] as justification for a failure to perform. However, with regards to the Vienna Convention and the [[UNIDROIT]] Principles it should be kept in mind that these are heavily influenced by civil law jurisdictions. To derive from these sources that pacta sunt servanda includes the principle of good faith is therefore incorrect.

The only limit to ''pacta sunt servanda'' are the [[peremptory norm]]s of general international law, called ''jus cogens'' (compelling law). The legal principle ''[[clausula rebus sic stantibus]]'', part of [[customary international law]], also allows for treaty obligations to be unfulfilled due to a compelling change in circumstances.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4293">[[File:Jacobi_UeberLehreSpinoza1789.jpg|right|thumb|Über die Lehre des Spinoza, 2nd ed. (1789)]]
The '''pantheism controversy''' ({{lang-de|Pantheismusstreit}}) was an event in German cultural history that lasted between 1785–1789 which had an effect throughout Europe.

==History==
A conversation between the German philosopher [[Friedrich Heinrich Jacobi]] and the German dramatist [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing]] in 1780 led Jacobi to a protracted study of [[Baruch Spinoza]]'s works. Lessing had avowed that he knew no philosophy, in the true sense of that word, save [[Spinozism]].

Jacobi's ''Über die Lehre des Spinozas'' (1st ed. 1785, 2nd ed. 1789) expressed sharply and clearly his strenuous objection to a dogmatic system in philosophy, and drew upon him the vigorous enmity of the [[Berlin, Germany|Berlin]] group, led by [[Moses Mendelssohn]]. Jacobi claimed that Spinoza's doctrine was pure [[materialism]], because all Nature and God are said to be nothing but extended [[Substance theory|substance]]. This, for Jacobi, was the result of [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] [[rationalism]] and it would finally end in absolute [[atheism]]. Mendelssohn disagreed with Jacobi, saying that there is no actual difference between [[theism]] and [[pantheism]]. The entire issue became a major intellectual and religious concern for European civilization at the time, which [[Immanuel Kant]] rejected, as he thought that attempts to conceive of transcendent reality would lead to [[antinomy|antinomies]] in thought.

Jacobi was ridiculed for trying to reintroduce into philosophy the antiquated notion of unreasoning belief, was denounced as an enemy of reason, as a [[pietist]], and as a [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] in disguise, and was especially attacked for his use of the ambiguous term ''Glaube'' ([[German (language)|German]]: "belief, faith"). 

Willi Goetschel argues that Jacobi's publication significantly shaped the reception of Spinoza's doctrine for centuries following its publication, obscuring the nuance of Spinoza's philosophic work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Goetschel|first1=Willi|title=Spinoza's Modernity: Mendelssohn, Lessing, and Heine|date=2004|publisher=University of Wisconsin Press|location=Madison, Wisconsin|isbn=0299190803|pages=12-13|ref=Goetschel2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Pantheism controversy is also notable for its development of and influence upon prominent philosophical terms in German culture, including the idea of [[nihilism]] and claims that [[God is dead]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Josephson-Storm | first = Jason | title = The Myth of Disenchantment: Magic, Modernity, and the Birth of the Human Sciences | location = Chicago | publisher = University of Chicago Press | date = 2017 |page = 74 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=xZ5yDgAAQBAJ | isbn = 0-226-40336-X }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jacobi's next important work, ''[[David Hume]] Über den Glauben, oder Idealismus und Realismus'' (1787), was an attempt to show not only that the term ''Glaube'' had been used by the most eminent writers to denote what he had employed it for in the ''Letters on Spinoza'', but that the nature of the cognition of facts as opposed to the construction of inferences could not be otherwise expressed. In this writing, and especially in the appendix, Jacobi came into contact with the [[critical philosophy]], and subjected the Kantian view of knowledge to searching examination.

The attraction of Spinoza's philosophy to late eighteenth-century Europeans was that it provided an alternative to materialism, atheism, and [[deism]]. Three of Spinoza's ideas strongly appealed to them:
*the unity of all that exists;
*the regularity of all that happens; and
*the identity of spirit and nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lange|first1=Frederick Albert|title=History of Materialism and Criticism of its Present Importance, Vol. II|date=1880|publisher=Houghton, Osgood, &amp; Co.|location=Boston|page=147|url=https://archive.org/details/historyofmateria02lang|accessdate=11 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Parataxic distortion''' is a [[psychiatry|psychiatric]] term first used by [[Harry Stack Sullivan|Harry S. Sullivan]] to describe the inclination to skew [[perception]]s of others based on [[fantasy]]. The "distortion" is a faulty perception of others, based not on actual experience with the other individual, but on a projected fantasy [[wikt:personality|personality]] attributed to the individual. For example, when one falls in love, an image of another person as the “perfect match” or “soul mate” can be created when in reality, the other person may not live up to these expectations or embody the imagined traits at all. 

The fantasy personality is created in part from past experiences and from expectations as to how the person 'should be', and is formulated in response to [[emotional stress]]. This stress can originate from the formation of a new relationship, or from [[cognitive dissonance]] required to maintain an existing relationship. Parataxic distortion serves as an immature cognitive [[defense mechanism]] against this psychological stress and is similar to [[Transference]].

Parataxic distortion is difficult to avoid because of the nature of human learning and interaction. Stereotyping of individuals based on social cues and the classification of people into groups is a commonplace cognitive function of the human mind. Such [[pigeonholing]] allows for a person to gain a quick, though possibly inaccurate, assessment of an interaction. The cognitive processes employed, however, can have a distorting effect on the clear understanding of individuals. In essence, one can lose the ability to 'hear the other' through one's own projected beliefs of what the other person is saying.

==Etymology==
From the Greek παράταξις, "placement side by side" 

Para - A Greek prefix which came to designate objects or activities auxiliary to or derivative of that denoted by the base word ( parody; paronomasia, paranoia) and hence abnormal or defective.
 
Taxic - indicating movement towards or away from a specified stimulus.

In this sense, Parataxic distortion, is a shift in perception away from reality.
	
==Interpersonal relationships and emotions==

Distorting one's perception of others can often interfere with interpersonal relationships. In many cases, however, it may be beneficial to do so. Humans are constantly and subconsciously stereotyping. According to Paul Martin Lester, "our brains naturally classify what we see, we can't help but notice the differences in physical attributes between one person and another."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://paulmartinlester.info/writings/stereotype.html|title=PICTORIAL STEREOTYPES IN THE MEDIA|website=paulmartinlester.info|access-date=2018-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parataxic distortion runs parallel to stereotyping while it remains in the subconscious. As we make quick judgments, we are drawing from previous experiences stored in our memory.

Parataxic distortion can be a beneficial defense mechanism for the individual, allowing the individual to maintain relationships with others with whom he or she would otherwise be unable to interact or allowing the individual to endure difficult periods in relationships. A self-imposed blindness to certain personality traits can keep a relationship healthy, or it can also prove destructive. For instance, parataxic distortion can keep one in denial of the abusive nature of a spouse.

==Attachment theory==

Parataxic distortion can begin in the early stages of development in [[infants]]. A mother’s nurturing personality and emotional warmth might be projected onto a lover later in life. This could initially generate stronger feelings for the woman than are warranted by her behavior and character alone. This example of [[attachment theory]] correlates with Parataxic Distortion.

Attachment theory would have it that the fantasy selves projected onto others in parataxic distortion are informed by our long-term attachment patterns. Not only are these imagined traits the resultant of our earliest bonds and unresolved emotional issues from past relationships, but they are recreated in these fantasy selves for the purpose of recreating that past attachment in the present.

==Negative effects==
Dealing with current situations or people that relate to a past event, or remind someone of a person from the past, can have negative effects on a human from an emotional standpoint. If the person from the past was a negative figure or the past event had a negative influence on a person, the person may create a self-sense of identity for the new individual they met. The negative emotional response happens when the individual realizes that they have been creating a fake identity for the new individual. 

Parataxic distortion is most effective in the realm of interpersonal communication. Parataxic distortion is typically used to avoid coping with past events. For example, if a child is mistreated by his or her father, the child may not only attach the fear and anger towards the father but will also relate this fear and anger to other men that look, talk or act like the father. The human mind keeps track of situations that we have encountered in the past to help us deal with future situations. The unconscious memory, without our knowing, helps us understand and deal with situations in the present that we have dealt with in the past. Parataxic distortion and our unconscious mind make us act the same way in current situations as we did in the past, even without realizing it.

==Defense mechanism==

As a [[Defence mechanisms|defense mechanism]], parataxic distortion protects one from the emotional consequences of a past event. A person may not remember a certain event, or be acting on it consciously, but will act a certain way to protect themselves from an outcome with the use of parataxic distortion. This behavior is a pathological attempt to cope with reality by using unreality.

Parataxic distortion is a commonly used psychological defense mechanism. It is not an illness or a disease, but a part of everyday, normal human psychology that can become maladaptive in certain situations. The cognitive abilities used to generate internal models of others are useful in interaction. As we can never truly internalize the full reality of another, we must interact with a shorthand version of them. It's only when we believe that the shorthand version is their reality that this ability can become maladaptive. One may also attempt to coerce or force another to 'fit the mold' and act more according to expectations, more like the idealized version they dream the other as being. This is also pathological. 

However, all humans engage in parataxic distortion to one extent or another, in one realm or another. It may be to manage emotions within their family, to facilitate communication between them and their spouse, or to imagine a relationship between them and their nation-state.

{{wiktionary}}

A '''political football''' is a topic or issue that is seized on by opposing political parties or factions and made a more political issue than it might initially seem to be. "To make a political football" [out of something] is defined in [[William Safire]]'s ''Safire's Political Dictionary'' as "To thrust a social, national security, or otherwise ostensibly non-political matter into partisan politics".  In 1953 the gangster [[Lucky Luciano]] complained in an interview to Safire that "I been a political football".&lt;ref name="saf 555"/&gt; 

A less-used meaning, is a political issue that is continually debated but left unresolved.  The term is often used during a political election [[Political campaign|campaign]] to highlight issues that have not been completely addressed, such as the [[natural environment]] and [[abortion]].{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

==History==

The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' has English examples of the use of "football" (the ball, not the game) in a figurative sense for something helplessly tossed around by others as early as the 16th century, for example, from about 1600: "I am the verye foote-ball of the starres". The phrase is used by the ''[[Bangor, Maine]] Whig and Courier'' in 1857.&lt;ref name="saf 555"&gt;Safire, 555&lt;/ref&gt; An American cartoon  from the time of [[Benjamin Harrison|President Harrison]] in 1889 shows a clear visual illustration of the metaphor, without using the actual phrase. It is now equally popular in other English-speaking countries, where the association is naturally with [[association football]] ("soccer") or the predominant local form of football.

==Other football metaphors in American politics==
Many other [[American football]] terms are in common use in the United States. Once a topic or issue has presented itself, the opposition will take the issue and "[[Rush (football)|run with it]]" and "try to score points". There may be many parties in opposition to take up the topic, and sometimes run it into the ground, which at times can "backfire" and end up hurting the opposing faction. This can happen to the point of that party being seen as "[[Fumble|fumbling]]" the issue. When a party or candidate ends up ignoring or putting off the issue, they are said to be "[[Punt (gridiron football)|punting]]" it.  In addition to the opponents of the politician or party using the subject as political fuel, the [[Mass media|media]] may also "run with it". "[[Moving the goalposts]]" is the practice of changing the criteria of something while it is in progress (such as an investigation or a hearing) in order to offer one side an inherent advantage or disadvantage. Sometimes these matters become larger, like during an election, than anyone would have thought possible during the event itself.

Other countries also use metaphors drawn from their local sport in discussing politics, such as [[association football|soccer]], [[Australian rules football]], [[baseball]], [[rugby union]]/[[rugby league]] or [[cricket]].

In the branch of [[abstract algebra]] known as [[ring theory]], a '''left primitive ring''' is a [[Ring (mathematics)|ring]] which has a faithful simple [[left module]]. Well known examples include [[endomorphism ring]]s of [[vector spaces]] and [[Weyl algebra]]s over fields of characteristic zero.

== Definition ==
A [[ring (mathematics)|ring]] ''R'' is said to be a '''left primitive ring''' if and only if it has a [[faithful module|faithful]] [[simple module|simple]] [[module (mathematics)|left ''R''-module]].  A '''right primitive ring''' is defined similarly with right ''R''-modules. There are rings which are primitive on one side but not on the other. The first example was constructed by [[George Bergman|George M. Bergman]] in {{harv|Bergman|1964}}.  Another example found by Jategaonkar showing the distinction can be found in {{harv|Rowen|1988, p.159}}

An internal characterization of left primitive rings is as follows: a ring is left primitive if and only if there is a maximal [[left ideal]] containing no nonzero two-sided [[ideal (ring theory)|ideals]]. The analogous definition for right primitive rings is also valid.

The structure of left primitive rings is completely determined by the [[Jacobson density theorem]]: A ring is left primitive if and only if it is isomorphic to a [[Jacobson density theorem#Topological characterization|dense]] subring of the [[ring of endomorphisms]] of a left [[vector space]] over a division ring.

Another equivalent definition states that a ring is left primitive if and only if it is a [[prime ring]] with a faithful left module of [[length of a module|finite length]] ({{harvnb|Lam|2001}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=2T5DAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA191 Ex.&amp;nbsp;11.19, p.&amp;nbsp;191]).

==Properties==
One sided primitive rings are both [[semiprimitive ring]]s and [[prime ring]]s.  Since the ring product of two or more nonzero rings is not prime, it is clear that the product of primitive rings is never primitive.  

For a left [[Artinian ring]], it is known that the conditions "left primitive", "right primitive", "prime", and "[[simple ring|simple]]" are all equivalent, and in this case it is a [[semisimple ring]] isomorphic to a square matrix ring over a division ring.  More generally, in any ring with a minimal one sided ideal, "left primitive"="right primitive"="prime".

A [[commutative ring]] is left primitive if and only if it is a [[field (mathematics)|field]].

Being left primitive is a [[Morita equivalence|Morita invariant property]].

== Examples ==
Every [[simple ring]] ''R'' with unity is both left and right primitive.  (However, a simple non-unital ring may not be primitive.)  This follows from the fact that [[maximal ideal#Properties|''R'' has a maximal left ideal]] ''M'', and the fact that the [[quotient module]] ''R''/''M'' is a simple left ''R''-module, and that its [[annihilator (ring theory)|annihilator]] is a proper two-sided ideal in ''R''. Since ''R'' is a simple ring, this annihilator is {0} and therefore ''R''/''M'' is a faithful left ''R''-module.

[[Weyl algebra]]s over fields with [[characteristic (algebra)|characteristic]] zero are primitive, and since they are [[domain (ring theory)|domain]]s, they are examples without minimal one-sided ideals.&lt;!-- how about positive char? --&gt;

===Full linear rings===
A special case of primitive rings is that of ''full linear rings''.  A '''left full linear ring''' is the ring of ''all'' linear transformations of an infinite dimensional left vector space over a division ring.  (A '''right full linear ring''' differs by using a right vector space instead.)  In symbols, &lt;math&gt;R=\mathrm{End}(_D V)\,&lt;/math&gt; where ''V'' is a vector space over a division ring ''D''.  It is known that ''R'' is a left full linear ring if and only if ''R'' is [[von Neumann regular]], [[Injective module#Self-injective rings|left self-injective]] with [[socle (mathematics)|socle]] soc(&lt;sub&gt;''R''&lt;/sub&gt;''R'')≠{0}. {{harv|Goodearl|1991|p=100}} Through linear algebra arguments, it can be shown that &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{End}(_D V)\,&lt;/math&gt; is isomorphic to the ring of [[matrix ring#Examples|row finite matrices]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{RFM}_I(D)\,&lt;/math&gt;, where ''I'' is an index set whose size is the dimension of ''V'' over ''D''.  Likewise right full linear rings can be realized as column finite matrices over ''D''.

Using this we can see that there are non-simple left primitive rings.  By the Jacobson Density characterization, a left full linear ring ''R'' is always left primitive. When dim&lt;sub&gt;''D''&lt;/sub&gt;''V'' is finite ''R'' is a square matrix ring over ''D'', but when dim&lt;sub&gt;''D''&lt;/sub&gt;''V'' is infinite, the set of finite rank linear transformations is a proper two-sided ideal of ''R'', and hence ''R'' is not simple.

[[Jan Arnoldus Schouten]] developed the modern notation and formalism for this mathematical framework, and made contributions to the theory, during its applications to [[general relativity]] and [[differential geometry]] in the early twentieth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schouten|first=Jan A.|title=Der Ricci-Kalkül – Eine Einführung in die neueren Methoden und Probleme der mehrdimensionalen Differentialgeometrie (Ricci Calculus – An introduction in the latest methods and problems in multi-dimmensional differential geometry)|language=german|year=1924|series=Grundlehren der mathematischen Wissenschaften|volume=10|editor= R.

A component of a tensor is a [[real number]] that is used as a coefficient of a basis element for the tensor space. The tensor is the sum of its components multiplied by their corresponding basis elements. Tensors and tensor fields can be expressed in terms of their components, and operations on tensors and tensor fields can be expressed in terms of operations on their components. The description of tensor fields and operations on them in terms of their components is the focus of the Ricci calculus. This notation allows an efficient expression of such tensor fields and operations. While much of the notation may be applied with any tensors, operations relating to a [[differential structure]] are only applicable to tensor fields.  Where needed, the notation extends to components of non-tensors, particularly [[multidimensional array]]s.

A tensor may be expressed as a linear sum of the [[tensor product]] of [[Vector (mathematics and physics)|vector]] and [[covector]] basis elements. The resulting tensor components are labelled by indices of the basis. Each index has one possible value per [[dimension]] of the underlying [[vector space]]. The number of indices equals the degree (or order) of the tensor.

For compactness and convenience, the notational convention implies summation over indices repeated within a term and [[universal quantification]] over free indices. Expressions in the notation of the Ricci calculus may generally be interpreted as a set of simultaneous equations relating the components as functions over a manifold, usually more specifically as functions of the coordinates on the manifold. This allows intuitive manipulation of expressions with familiarity of only a limited set of rules.

==Notation for indices==

{{see also|Index notation}}

===Basis-related distinctions===

====Space and time coordinates====

Where a distinction is to be made between the space-like basis elements and a time-like element in the four-dimensional spacetime of classical physics, this is conventionally done through indices as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | author=C. Møller|title=The Theory of Relativity|year=1952|page=234}} is an example of a variation: 'Greek indices run from 1 to 3, Latin indices from 1 to 4'&lt;/ref&gt;
*The lowercase [[Latin alphabet]] {{math|''a'', ''b'', ''c'', ...}} is used to indicate restriction to 3-dimensional [[Euclidean space]], which take values 1, 2, 3 for the spatial components; and the time-like element, indicated by 0, is shown separately.
*The lowercase [[Greek alphabet]] {{math|''α'', ''β'', ''γ'', ...}} is used for 4-dimensional [[spacetime]], which typically take values 0 for time components and 1, 2, 3 for the spatial components.

Some sources use 4 instead of 0 as the index value corresponding to time; in this article, 0 is used. Otherwise, in general mathematical contexts, any symbols can be used for the indices, generally running over all dimensions of the vector space.

====Coordinate and index notation====

The author(s) will usually make it clear whether a subscript is intended as an index or as a label.

For example, in 3-D Euclidean space and using [[Cartesian coordinates]]; the [[coordinate vector]] {{math|1='''A''' = (''A''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''A''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''A''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) = (''A''&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;, ''A''&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;, ''A''&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;)}} shows a direct correspondence between the subscripts 1, 2, 3 and the labels {{math|x, y, z}}. In the expression {{math|''A&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}}, {{math|''i''}} is interpreted as an index ranging over the values 1, 2, 3, while the {{math|x, y, z}} subscripts are not variable indices, more like "names" for the components. In the context of spacetime, the index value 0 conventionally corresponds to the label {{math|t}}.

====Reference to basis====

Indices themselves may be ''labelled'' using [[diacritic]]-like symbols, such as a [[Circumflex|hat]] (ˆ), [[Macron (diacritic)|bar]] (¯), [[tilde]] (˜), or prime (′) as in:

:&lt;math&gt;X_{\hat{\phi}}\,, Y_{\bar{\lambda}}\,, Z_{\tilde{\eta}}\,, T_{\mu'} &lt;/math&gt;

to denote a possibly different [[Basis (linear algebra)|basis]] for that index. An example is in [[Lorentz transformation]]s from one [[frame of reference]] to another, where one frame could be unprimed and the other primed, as in:
:&lt;math&gt; v^{\mu'} = v^{\nu}L_\nu{}^{\mu'} .&lt;/math&gt;

This is not to be confused with [[van der Waerden notation]] for [[spinor]]s, which uses hats and overdots on indices to reflect the chirality of a spinor.

===Upper and lower indices===

====[[Covariance and contravariance of vectors|Covariant tensor components]]====

A ''lower index'' (subscript) indicates covariance of the components with respect to that index:
:&lt;math&gt;A_{\alpha\beta\gamma \cdots}&lt;/math&gt;

====[[Covariance and contravariance of vectors|Contravariant tensor components]]====

An ''upper index'' (superscript) indicates contravariance of the components with respect to that index:
:&lt;math&gt;A^{\alpha\beta\gamma \cdots}&lt;/math&gt;

====[[Mixed tensor|Mixed-variance tensor components]]====

A tensor may have both upper and lower indices:
:&lt;math&gt;A_{\alpha}{}^{\beta}{}_{\gamma}{}^{\delta\cdots}.&lt;/math&gt;

Ordering of indices is significant, even when of differing variance.  However, when it is understood that no indices will be raised or lowered while retaining the base symbol, covariant indices are sometimes placed below contravariant indices for notational convenience (e.g. with the [[generalized Kronecker delta]]).

====Tensor type and degree====

The number of each upper and lower indices of a tensor gives its ''type'': a tensor with {{math|''p''}} upper and {{math|''q''}} lower indices is said to be of type {{math|(''p'', ''q'')}}, or to be a type-{{math|(''p'', ''q'')}} tensor.

The number of indices of a tensor, regardless of variance, is called the ''degree'' of the tensor (alternatively, its ''valence'', ''order'' or ''rank'', although ''rank'' is ambiguous).  Thus, a tensor of type {{math|(''p'', ''q'')}} has degree {{math|''p'' + ''q''}}.

====[[Summation convention]]====

The same symbol occurring twice (one upper and one lower) within a term indicates a pair of indices that are summed over:

:&lt;math&gt; A_\alpha B^\alpha \equiv \sum_\alpha A_{\alpha}B^\alpha \quad \text{or} \quad A^\alpha B_\alpha \equiv \sum_\alpha A^{\alpha}B_\alpha \,.&lt;/math&gt;

The operation implied by such a summation is called [[tensor contraction]]:

:&lt;math&gt; A_\alpha B^\beta \rightarrow A_\alpha B^\alpha \equiv \sum_\alpha A_{\alpha}B^\alpha \,.&lt;/math&gt;

This summation may occur more than once within a term with a distinct symbol per pair of indices, for example:

:&lt;math&gt; A_{\alpha}{}^\gamma B^\alpha C_\gamma{}^\beta \equiv \sum_\alpha \sum_\gamma A_{\alpha}{}^\gamma B^\alpha C_\gamma{}^\beta \,.&lt;/math&gt;

Other combinations of repeated indices within a term are considered to be ill-formed, such as

:&lt;math&gt; A_{\alpha\alpha}{}^{\gamma} &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; A_{\alpha\gamma}{}^{\gamma} B^\alpha C_{\gamma}{}^{\beta} \,,&lt;/math&gt;

since they are meaningless: they do not transform as tensors under a change of basis.

====[[Multi-index notation]]====

If a tensor has a list of all upper or lower indices, one shorthand is to use a capital letter for the list:&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | author=T. Frankel|page=67| title = The Geometry of Physics| publisher=Cambridge University Press|edition=3rd|year=2012|isbn=978-1107-602601}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; A_{i_1 \cdots i_n}B^{i_1 \cdots i_n j_1 \cdots j_m}C_{j_1 \cdots j_m} \equiv A_I B^{IJ} C_J &lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|1=''I'' = ''i''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ''i''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ⋅⋅⋅ ''i&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''}} and {{math|1=''J'' = ''j''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ''j''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ⋅⋅⋅ ''j&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;''}}.

====Sequential summation====

A pair of vertical bars {{math|{{!}} {{!}}}} around a set of all-upper indices or all-lower indices, associated with contraction with another set of indices:&lt;ref&gt;Gravitation, J.A. Wheeler, C. Misner, K.S. Thorne, W.H. Freeman &amp; Co, 1973, p.&amp;nbsp;91, {{isbn|0-7167-0344-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
  A_{|\alpha \beta \gamma| \cdots} B^{\alpha\beta\gamma \cdots} =
  A_{\alpha \beta \gamma \cdots} B^{|\alpha\beta\gamma| \cdots} =
  \sum_{\alpha &lt; \beta &lt; \gamma} A_{\alpha \beta \gamma \cdots} B^{\alpha\beta\gamma \cdots}
&lt;/math&gt;

means a restricted sum over index values, where each index is constrained to being strictly less than the next. The vertical bars are placed around either the upper set or the lower set of contracted indices, not both sets. Normally when contracting indices, the sum is over all values. In this notation, the summations are restricted as a computational convenience. This is useful when the expression is [[antisymmetric tensor|completely antisymmetric]] in each of the two sets of indices, as might occur on the tensor product of a {{math|''p''}}-vector with a {{math|''q''}}-form. More than one group can be summed in this way, for example:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
      &amp;A_{|\alpha \beta\gamma|}{}^{|\delta\epsilon\cdots\lambda|}
         B^{\alpha \beta\gamma}{}_{\delta\epsilon\cdots\lambda|\mu \nu \cdots\zeta|}
         C^{\mu\nu\cdots \zeta} \\[3pt]
  ={} &amp;\sum_{\alpha &lt; \beta &lt; \gamma}~\sum_{\delta &lt; \epsilon &lt; \cdots &lt; \lambda}~\sum_{\mu &lt; \nu &lt; \cdots &lt; \zeta}
         A_{\alpha \beta\gamma}{}^{\delta\epsilon\cdots\lambda}
         B^{\alpha \beta\gamma}{}_{\delta\epsilon\cdots\lambda\mu \nu\cdots\zeta}
         C^{\mu\nu\cdots\zeta}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

When using multi-index notation, an underarrow is placed underneath the block of indices:&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | author=T. Frankel| title = The Geometry of Physics|page=67| publisher=Cambridge University Press|edition=3rd|year=2012|isbn=978-1107-602601}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
  A_{\underset{\rightharpoondown}{P}}{}^{\underset{\rightharpoondown}{Q}} B^P{}_{Q\underset{\rightharpoondown}{R}} C^R =
  \sum_\underset{\rightharpoondown}{P} \sum_\underset{\rightharpoondown}{Q} \sum_\underset{\rightharpoondown}{R} A_{P}{}^{Q} B^P{}_{QR} C^R &lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;
  \underset{\rightharpoondown}{P} = |\alpha \beta\gamma|\,,\quad
  \underset{\rightharpoondown}{Q} = |\delta\epsilon\cdots\lambda|\,,\quad
  \underset{\rightharpoondown}{R} = |\mu \nu \cdots\zeta|
&lt;/math&gt;

====[[Raising and lowering indices]]====

By contracting an index with a non-singular [[metric tensor]], the [[mixed tensor|type]] of a tensor can be changed, converting a lower index to an upper index or vice versa:
:&lt;math&gt;B^{\gamma}{}_{\beta\cdots} = g^{\gamma\alpha}A_{\alpha\beta\cdots} \quad \text{and} \quad A_{\alpha\beta\cdots} = g_{\alpha\gamma}B^{\gamma}{}_{\beta\cdots}&lt;/math&gt;

The base symbol in many cases is retained (e.g. using {{math|''A''}} where {{math|''B''}} appears here), and when there is no ambiguity, repositioning an index may be taken to imply this operation.

===Correlations between index positions and invariance===

This table summarizes how the manipulation of covariant and contravariant indices fit in with invariance under a [[passive transformation]] between bases, with the components of each basis set in terms of the other reflected in the first column. The barred indices refer to the final coordinate system after the transformation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |pages=61, 202–203, 232|author1=J.A. Wheeler |author2=C. Misner |author3=K.S. Thorne | title=[[Gravitation (book)|Gravitation]]| publisher=W.H. Freeman &amp; Co| year=1973 | isbn=0-7167-0344-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Kronecker delta]] is used, [[#Notable tensors|see also below]].

==General outlines for index notation and operations==
Tensors are equal [[if and only if]] every corresponding component is equal; e.g., tensor {{math|''A''}} equals tensor {{math|''B''}} if and only if

:&lt;math&gt;A^{\alpha}{}_{\beta\gamma} = B^{\alpha}{}_{\beta\gamma}&lt;/math&gt;

for all {{math|''α'', ''β'', ''γ''}}. Consequently, there are facets of the notation that are useful in checking that an equation makes sense (an analogous procedure to [[dimensional analysis]]).

===[[Einstein notation#Introduction|Free and dummy indices]]===

Indices not involved in contractions are called ''free indices''. Indices used in contractions are termed ''dummy indices'', or ''summation indices''.

===A tensor equation represents many ordinary (real-valued) equations===

The components of tensors (like {{math|''A&lt;sup&gt;α&lt;/sup&gt;''}}, {{math|''B&lt;sub&gt;β&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;γ&lt;/sup&gt;''}} etc.) are just real numbers. Since the indices take various integer values to select specific components of the tensors, a single tensor equation represents many ordinary equations. If a tensor equality has {{math|''n''}} free indices, and if the dimensionality of the underlying vector space is {{math|''m''}}, the equality represents {{math|''m&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;''}} equations: each index takes on every value of a specific set of values.

For instance, if

:&lt;math&gt;A^\alpha B_\beta{}^\gamma C_{\gamma\delta} + D^\alpha{}_\beta{} E_\delta = T^\alpha{}_\beta{}_\delta &lt;/math&gt;

is in [[Four-dimensional space|four dimensions]] (that is, each index runs from 0 to 3 or from 1 to 4), then because there are three free indices ({{math|''α'', ''β'', ''δ''}}), there are 4&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; = 64 equations. Three of these are:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  A^0 B_1{}^0 C_{00} + A^0 B_1{}^1 C_{10} + A^0 B_1{}^2 C_{20} + A^0 B_1{}^3 C_{30} + D^0{}_1{} E_0 &amp;= T^0{}_1{}_0 \\
  A^1 B_0{}^0 C_{00} + A^1 B_0{}^1 C_{10} + A^1 B_0{}^2 C_{20} + A^1 B_0{}^3 C_{30} + D^1{}_0{} E_0 &amp;= T^1{}_0{}_0 \\
  A^1 B_2{}^0 C_{02} + A^1 B_2{}^1 C_{12} + A^1 B_2{}^2 C_{22} + A^1 B_2{}^3 C_{32} + D^1{}_2{} E_2 &amp;= T^1{}_2{}_2.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

This illustrates the compactness and efficiency of using index notation: many equations which all share a similar structure can be collected into one simple tensor equation.

===Indices are replaceable labels===

Replacing any index symbol throughout by another leaves the tensor equation unchanged (provided there is no conflict with other symbols already used). This can be useful when manipulating indices, such as using index notation to verify [[vector calculus identities]] or identities of the [[Kronecker delta]] and [[Levi-Civita symbol#Properties|Levi-Civita symbol]] (see also below). An example of a correct change is:

:&lt;math&gt;A^\alpha B_\beta{}^\gamma C_{\gamma\delta} + D^\alpha{}_\beta{} E_\delta \rightarrow A^\lambda B_\beta{}^\mu C_{\mu\delta} + D^\lambda{}_\beta{} E_\delta \,,&lt;/math&gt;

whereas an erroneous change is:

:&lt;math&gt;A^\alpha B_\beta{}^\gamma C_{\gamma\delta} + D^\alpha{}_\beta{} E_\delta \nrightarrow  A^\lambda B_\beta{}^\gamma C_{\mu\delta} + D^\alpha{}_\beta{} E_\delta \,.&lt;/math&gt;

In the first replacement, {{math|''λ''}} replaced {{math|''α''}} and {{math|''μ''}} replaced {{math|''γ''}} ''everywhere'', so the expression still has the same meaning. In the second, {{math|''λ''}} did not fully replace {{math|''α''}}, and {{math|''μ''}} did not fully replace {{math|''γ''}} (incidentally, the contraction on the {{math|''γ''}} index became a tensor product), which is entirely inconsistent for reasons shown next.

===Indices are the same in every term===

The same indices on each side of a tensor equation always appear in the same (upper or lower) position throughout every term, ''except'' for indices repeated in a term (which implies a summation over that index), for example:
:&lt;math&gt;A^\alpha B_\beta{}^\gamma C_{\gamma\delta} + D^\alpha{}_\beta{} E_\delta = T^\alpha{}_\beta{}_\delta &lt;/math&gt;

as for an erroneous expression:
:&lt;math&gt;A^\alpha B_\beta{}^\gamma C_{\gamma\delta} + D_\alpha{}_\beta{}^\gamma E^\delta. &lt;/math&gt;

In other words, non-repeated indices must be of the same type in every term of the equation. In the above identity, {{math|''α'', ''β'', ''δ''}} line up throughout and {{math|''γ''}} occurs twice in one term due to a contraction (once as an upper index and once as a lower index), and thus it is a valid expression. In the invalid expression, while {{math|''β''}} lines up, {{math|''α''}} and {{math|''δ''}} do not, and {{math|''γ''}} appears twice in one term (contraction) ''and'' once in another term, which is inconsistent.

===Brackets and punctuation used once where implied===

When applying a rule to a number of indices (differentiation, symmetrization etc., shown next), the bracket or punctuation symbols denoting the rules are only shown on one group of the indices to which they apply.

If the brackets enclose ''covariant indices'' – the rule applies only to ''all covariant indices enclosed in the brackets'', not to any contravariant indices which happen to be placed intermediately between the brackets.

Similarly if brackets enclose ''contravariant indices'' – the rule applies only to ''all enclosed contravariant indices'', not to intermediately placed covariant indices.

==Symmetric and antisymmetric parts==
===[[Symmetric tensor|Symmetric]] part of tensor===

[[Bracket#Parentheses ( )|Parentheses, (&amp;nbsp;)]], around multiple indices denotes the symmetrized part of the tensor. When symmetrizing {{math|''p''}} indices using {{math|''σ''}} to range over permutations of the numbers 1 to {{math|''p''}}, one takes a sum over the [[permutation]]s of those indices {{math|''α''&lt;sub&gt;''σ''(''i'')&lt;/sub&gt;}} for {{math|1=''i'' = 1, 2, 3, …, ''p''}}, and then divides by the number of permutations:

:&lt;math&gt;
  A_{(\alpha_1\alpha_2\cdots\alpha_p)\alpha_{p + 1}\cdots\alpha_q} =
  \dfrac{1}{p!} \sum_{\sigma} A_{\alpha_{\sigma(1)}\cdots\alpha_{\sigma(p)}\alpha_{p + 1}\cdots\alpha_{q}} \,.
&lt;/math&gt;

For example, two symmetrizing indices mean there are two indices to permute and sum over:

:&lt;math&gt;A_{(\alpha\beta)\gamma\cdots} = \dfrac{1}{2!} \left(A_{\alpha\beta\gamma\cdots} + A_{\beta\alpha\gamma\cdots} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

while for three symmetrizing indices, there are three indices to sum over and permute:

:&lt;math&gt;
  A_{(\alpha\beta\gamma)\delta\cdots} =
  \dfrac{1}{3!} \left(A_{\alpha\beta\gamma\delta\cdots}
    + A_{\gamma\alpha\beta\delta\cdots} 
    + A_{\beta\gamma\alpha\delta\cdots} 
    + A_{\alpha\gamma\beta\delta\cdots}
    + A_{\gamma\beta\alpha\delta\cdots}
    + A_{\beta\alpha\gamma\delta\cdots}
  \right)
&lt;/math&gt;

The symmetrization is [[Distributive property|distributive]] over addition;

:&lt;math&gt;A_{(\alpha} \left(B_{\beta)\gamma\cdots} + C_{\beta)\gamma\cdots} \right) = A_{(\alpha}B_{\beta)\gamma\cdots} + A_{(\alpha}C_{\beta)\gamma\cdots}&lt;/math&gt;

Indices are not part of the symmetrization when they are:

*not on the same level, for example;
*:&lt;math&gt;A_{(\alpha}B^{\beta}{}_{\gamma)} = \dfrac{1}{2!} \left(A_{\alpha}B^{\beta}{}_{\gamma} + A_{\gamma}B^{\beta}{}_{\alpha} \right)&lt;/math&gt;
*within the parentheses and between vertical bars (i.e. |⋅⋅⋅|), modifying the previous example;
*:&lt;math&gt;A_{(\alpha}B_{|\beta|}{}_{\gamma)} = \dfrac{1}{2!} \left(A_{\alpha}B_{\beta \gamma} + A_{\gamma}B_{\beta \alpha} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

Here the {{math|''α''}} and {{math|''γ''}} indices are symmetrized, {{math|''β''}} is not.

===[[Antisymmetric tensor|Antisymmetric]] or alternating part of tensor===

[[Bracket#Square brackets &amp;#91; &amp;#93;|Square brackets, &lt;nowiki&gt;[&amp;nbsp;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;]], around multiple indices denotes the ''anti''symmetrized part of the tensor. For {{math|''p''}} antisymmetrizing indices – the sum over the permutations of those indices {{math|''α''&lt;sub&gt;''σ''(''i'')&lt;/sub&gt;}} multiplied by the [[signature (permutation)|signature of the permutation]] {{math|sgn(''σ'')}} is taken, then divided by the number of permutations:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
      &amp; A_{[\alpha_1\cdots\alpha_p]\alpha_{p+1}\cdots\alpha_q} \\[3pt]
  ={} &amp; \dfrac{1}{p!} \sum_{\sigma}\sgn(\sigma) A_{\alpha_{\sigma(1)}\cdots\alpha_{\sigma(p)}\alpha_{p+1}\cdots\alpha_{q}} \\
  ={} &amp; \delta_{\alpha_1 \cdots \alpha_p}^{\beta_1 \dots \beta_p} A_{\beta_1 \cdots \beta_p\alpha_{p+1}\cdots\alpha_q} \\
\end{align} &lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''δ''{{su|b=''α''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;⋅⋅⋅''α&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;''|p=''β''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;⋅⋅⋅''β&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;''|lh=0.8em}}}} is the [[generalized Kronecker delta]] of degree {{math|2''p''}}, with scaling as defined below.

For example, two antisymmetrizing indices imply:

:&lt;math&gt;A_{[\alpha\beta]\gamma\cdots} = \dfrac{1}{2!} \left(A_{\alpha\beta\gamma\cdots} - A_{\beta\alpha\gamma\cdots} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

while three antisymmetrizing indices imply:

:&lt;math&gt;
  A_{[\alpha\beta\gamma]\delta\cdots} =
  \dfrac{1}{3!} \left(A_{\alpha\beta\gamma\delta\cdots}
    + A_{\gamma\alpha\beta\delta\cdots} 
    + A_{\beta\gamma\alpha\delta\cdots} 
    - A_{\alpha\gamma\beta\delta\cdots}
    - A_{\gamma\beta\alpha\delta\cdots}
    - A_{\beta\alpha\gamma\delta\cdots}
  \right)
&lt;/math&gt;

as for a more specific example, if {{math|''F''}} represents the [[electromagnetic tensor]], then the equation

:&lt;math&gt;
  0 = F_{[\alpha\beta, \gamma]} = \dfrac{1}{3!} \left(
    F_{\alpha\beta,\gamma}
    + F_{\gamma\alpha,\beta}
    + F_{\beta\gamma,\alpha}
    - F_{\beta\alpha,\gamma}
    - F_{\alpha\gamma,\beta}
    - F_{\gamma\beta,\alpha}
  \right) \,
&lt;/math&gt;

represents [[Gauss's law for magnetism]] and [[Faraday's law of induction]].

As before, the antisymmetrization is distributive over addition;

:&lt;math&gt;
  A_{[\alpha} \left(B_{\beta]\gamma\cdots} + C_{\beta]\gamma\cdots} \right) =
  A_{[\alpha}B_{\beta]\gamma\cdots} + A_{[\alpha}C_{\beta]\gamma\cdots}
&lt;/math&gt;

As with symmetrization, indices are not antisymmetrized when they are:

*not on the same level, for example;
*:&lt;math&gt;
  A_{[\alpha}B^{\beta}{}_{\gamma]} =
  \dfrac{1}{2!} \left(A_{\alpha}B^{\beta}{}_{\gamma} - A_{\gamma}B^{\beta}{}_{\alpha} \right)
&lt;/math&gt;
*within the square brackets and between vertical bars (i.e. |⋅⋅⋅|), modifying the previous example;
*:&lt;math&gt;
  A_{[\alpha}B_{|\beta|}{}_{\gamma]} =
  \dfrac{1}{2!} \left(A_{\alpha}B_{\beta \gamma} - A_{\gamma}B_{\beta \alpha} \right)
&lt;/math&gt;

Here the {{math|''α''}} and {{math|''γ''}} indices are antisymmetrized, {{math|''β''}} is not.

===Sum of symmetric and antisymmetric parts===

Any tensor can be written as the sum of its symmetric and antisymmetric parts on two indices:

:&lt;math&gt;A_{\alpha\beta\gamma\cdots} = A_{(\alpha\beta)\gamma\cdots}+A_{[\alpha\beta]\gamma\cdots}&lt;/math&gt;

as can be seen by adding the above expressions for {{math|''A''&lt;sub&gt;(''αβ'')''γ''⋅⋅⋅&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|''A''&lt;sub&gt;[''αβ'']''γ''⋅⋅⋅&lt;/sub&gt;}}. This does not hold for other than two indices.

==Differentiation==

{{see also|Four-gradient|d'Alembertian|Intrinsic derivative}}

For compactness, derivatives may be indicated by adding indices after a comma or semicolon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=G. Woan| title=The Cambridge Handbook of Physics Formulas| publisher=Cambridge University Press| year=2010 | isbn=978-0-521-57507-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://mathworld.wolfram.com/CovariantDerivative.html Covariant derivative] – Mathworld, Wolfram&lt;/ref&gt;

===[[Partial derivative]]===

While most of the expressions of the Ricci calculus are valid for arbitrary bases, the expressions involving partial derivatives of tensor coordinated apply only with a [[coordinate basis]]: a basis that is defined through differentiation of the coordinates.  Coordinates are typically denoted by {{math|''x''{{isup|''μ''}}}}, but do not in general form the components of a vector.  In flat spacetime with linear coordinatization, a tuple of ''differences'' in coordinates, {{math|Δ''x''{{isup|''μ''}}}}, can be treated as a contravariant vector.  With the same constraints on the space and on the choice of coordinate system, the partial derivatives with respect to the coordinates yield a result that is effectively covariant.  Aside from use in this special case, the partial derivatives of components of tensors are useful in building expressions that are covariant, albeit still with a coordinate basis if the partial derivatives are explicitly used, as with the covariant and Lie derivatives below.

To indicate partial differentiation of the components of a tensor field with respect to a coordinate variable {{math|''x''{{isup|''γ''}}}}, a ''[[comma]]'' is placed before an appended lower index of the coordinate variable.

:&lt;math&gt;A_{\alpha\beta\cdots,\gamma} = \dfrac{\partial}{\partial x^\gamma} A_{\alpha\beta\cdots}&lt;/math&gt;

This may be repeated (without adding further commas):

:&lt;math&gt;
  A_{\alpha_1\alpha_2\cdots\alpha_p\,,\,\alpha_{p+1}\cdots\alpha_q} =
  \dfrac{\partial^{q-p}}{\partial x^{\alpha_q}\cdots\partial x^{\alpha_{p+2}}\partial x^{\alpha_{p+1}}} A_{\alpha_1\alpha_2\cdots\alpha_p}.
&lt;/math&gt;

These components do ''not'' transform covariantly, unless the expression being differentiated is a scalar. This derivative is characterized by the [[product rule]] and the derivatives of the coordinates

:&lt;math&gt;x^{\alpha}{}_{, \gamma} = \delta^{\alpha}{}_\gamma ,&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''δ''}} is the [[Kronecker delta]].

===[[Covariant derivative]]===

To indicate covariant differentiation of any tensor field, a ''[[semicolon]]'' ({{math| ; }}) is placed before an appended lower (covariant) index. Less common alternatives to the semicolon include a ''[[Slash (punctuation)|forward slash]]'' ({{math| / }})&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | author=T. Frankel|page=298| title = The Geometry of Physics| publisher=Cambridge University Press|edition=3rd|year=2012|isbn=978-1107-602601}}&lt;/ref&gt; or in three-dimensional curved space a single vertical bar ({{math|&amp;nbsp;{{!}}&amp;nbsp;}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |pages=510, §21.5|author1=J.A.

For a contravariant vector, its covariant derivative is:
:&lt;math&gt;A^{\alpha}{}_{;\beta} = A^{\alpha}{}_{,\beta} + \Gamma^{\alpha} {}_{\gamma\beta}A^\gamma&lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|Γ''&lt;sup&gt;α&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;βγ&lt;/sub&gt;''}} is a [[Christoffel symbol]] of the second kind.

For a covariant vector, its covariant derivative is:
:&lt;math&gt;A_{\alpha ;\beta} = A_{\alpha,\beta} - \Gamma^{\gamma} {}_{\alpha\beta}A_\gamma \,.&lt;/math&gt;

For an arbitrary tensor:&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | author=T. Frankel|page=299| title = The Geometry of Physics| publisher=Cambridge University Press|edition=3rd|year=2012|isbn=978-1107-602601}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \begin{align}
    T^{\alpha_1 \cdots \alpha_r}{}_{\beta_1 \cdots \beta_s ; \gamma}
      &amp; \\
  = T^{\alpha_1 \cdots \alpha_r}{}_{\beta_1 \cdots \beta_s , \gamma}
      &amp;+ \, \Gamma^{\alpha_1}{}_{\delta \gamma} T^{\delta \alpha_2 \cdots \alpha_r}{}_{\beta_1 \cdots \beta_s} + \cdots + \Gamma^{\alpha_r}{}_{\delta \gamma} T^{\alpha_1 \cdots \alpha_{r-1} \delta}{}_{\beta_1 \cdots \beta_s} \\
      &amp;- \, \Gamma^\delta{}_{\beta_1 \gamma} T^{\alpha_1 \cdots \alpha_r}{}_{\delta \beta_2 \cdots \beta_s} - \cdots - \Gamma^\delta{}_{\beta_s \gamma} T^{\alpha_1 \cdots \alpha_r}{}_{\beta_1 \cdots \beta_{s-1} \delta}\,.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The components of this derivative of a tensor field transform covariantly, and hence form another tensor field. This derivative is characterized by the product rule and applied to the metric tensor {{math|''g&lt;sub&gt;μν&lt;/sub&gt;''}} it gives zero:

:&lt;math&gt;g_{\mu \nu ; \gamma} = 0 \,.&lt;/math&gt;

The covariant formulation of the [[directional derivative]] of any tensor field along a vector {{math|''v&lt;sup&gt;γ&lt;/sup&gt;''}} may be expressed as its contraction with the covariant derivative, e.g.:

:&lt;math&gt;v^\gamma A_{\alpha ;\gamma} \,.&lt;/math&gt;

One alternative notation for the covariant derivative of any tensor is the subscripted nabla symbol {{math|∇&lt;sub&gt;''β''&lt;/sub&gt;}}. For the case of a vector field {{math|''A&lt;sup&gt;α&lt;/sup&gt;''}}:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Relativity|series=Demystified|isbn=0-07-145545-0|year=2006|author=D. McMahon|publisher=McGraw Hill|page=67}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla_\beta A^\alpha = \frac{\partial A^\alpha}{\partial x^\beta} + \Gamma^\alpha{}_{\gamma\beta}A^\gamma .&lt;/math&gt;

===[[Lie derivative]]===

The Lie derivative is another derivative that is covariant, but which should not be confused with the ''covariant derivative''. It is defined even in the absence of a metric tensor.  The Lie derivative of a type {{math|(''r'', ''s'')}} tensor field {{math|''T''}} along (the flow of) a contravariant vector field {{math|''X''{{isup|''ρ''}}}} [[Lie derivative#Coordinate expressions|may be expressed as]]&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last1=Bishop|first1=R.L.|last2=Goldberg|first2=S.I.| year=1968| title = Tensor Analysis on Manifolds|page=130}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \begin{align}
  (\mathcal{L}_X T)^{\alpha_1 \cdots \alpha_r}{}_{\beta_1 \cdots \beta_s}
    &amp; \\
  = X^\gamma T^{\alpha_1 \cdots \alpha_r}{}_{\beta_1 \cdots \beta_s , \gamma}
    &amp; - \, X^{\alpha_1}{}_{, \gamma} T^{\gamma \alpha_2 \cdots \alpha_r}{}_{\beta_1 \cdots \beta_s} - \cdots - X^{\alpha_r}{}_{, \gamma} T^{\alpha_1 \cdots \alpha_{r-1} \gamma}{}_{\beta_1 \cdots \beta_s} \\
    &amp; + \, X^{\gamma}{}_{, \beta_1} T^{\alpha_1 \cdots \alpha_r}{}_{\gamma \beta_2 \cdots \beta_s} + \cdots + X^{\gamma}{}_{, \beta_s} T^{\alpha_1 \cdots \alpha_r}{}_{\beta_1 \cdots \beta_{s-1} \gamma} \,.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

This derivative is characterized by the product rule and the fact that the derivative of the given contravariant vector field {{math|''X''{{isup|''ρ''}}}} is zero.

:&lt;math&gt;(\mathcal{L}_X X)^{\rho} = [X, X]^{\rho} = 0 \,.&lt;/math&gt;

The Lie derivative of a type {{math|(''r'', ''s'')}} [[relative tensor]] field {{math|Λ}} of weight {{math|''w''}} along (the flow of) a contravariant vector field {{math|''X''{{isup|''ρ''}}}} [[Lie derivative#Coordinate expressions|may be expressed as]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last = Lovelock| first = David|author2=Hanno Rund |year= 1989|title = Tensors, Differential Forms, and Variational Principles|page=123}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \begin{align}
  (\mathcal{L}_X \Lambda)^{\alpha_1 \cdots \alpha_r}{}_{\beta_1 \cdots \beta_s}
    &amp; \\
  = X^\gamma \Lambda^{\alpha_1 \cdots \alpha_r}{}_{\beta_1 \cdots \beta_s , \gamma}
    &amp; - \, X^{\alpha_1}{}_{, \gamma} \Lambda^{\gamma \alpha_2 \cdots \alpha_r}{}_{\beta_1 \cdots \beta_s} - \cdots - X^{\alpha_r}{}_{, \gamma} \Lambda^{\alpha_1 \cdots \alpha_{r-1} \gamma}{}_{\beta_1 \cdots \beta_s} \\
    &amp; + \, X^{\gamma}{}_{, \beta_1} \Lambda^{\alpha_1 \cdots \alpha_r}{}_{\gamma \beta_2 \cdots \beta_s} + \cdots + X^{\gamma}{}_{, \beta_s} \Lambda^{\alpha_1 \cdots \alpha_r}{}_{\beta_1 \cdots \beta_{s-1} \gamma} \\
    &amp; + \, wX^{\gamma}{}_{, \gamma} \Lambda^{\alpha_1 \cdots \alpha_r}{}_{\beta_1 \cdots \beta_{s}}\,.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

==Notable tensors==
===[[Kronecker delta]]===
The Kronecker delta is like the [[identity matrix]]
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  \delta^{\alpha}_{\beta} \, A^{\beta} &amp;= A^{\alpha} \\
         \delta^{\mu}_{\nu} \, B_{\mu} &amp;= B_{\nu} \,
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

when multiplied and contracted. The components {{math|''δ''{{su|b=''β''|p=''α''|lh=1em}}}} are the same in any basis and form an invariant tensor of type {{nowrap|(1, 1)}}, i.e. the identity of the [[tangent bundle]] over the [[identity mapping]] of the [[base manifold]], and so its trace is an invariant.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last1=Bishop|first1=R.L.|last2=Goldberg|first2=S.I.| year=1968| title = Tensor Analysis on Manifolds|page=85}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Its [[Trace (linear algebra)|trace]] is the dimensionality of the space; for example, in four-dimensional [[spacetime]],
:&lt;math&gt;\delta^{\rho}_{\rho} = \delta^{0}_{0} + \delta^{1}_{1} + \delta^{2}_{2} + \delta^{3}_{3} = 4 .&lt;/math&gt;

The Kronecker delta is one of the family of generalized Kronecker deltas.  The generalized Kronecker delta of degree {{math|2''p''}} may be defined in terms of the Kronecker delta by (a common definition includes an additional multiplier of {{math|''p''!}} on the right):
:&lt;math&gt;\delta^{\alpha_1 \cdots \alpha_p}_{\beta_1 \cdots \beta_p} = \delta^{[\alpha_1}_{\beta_1} \cdots \delta^{\alpha_p]}_{\beta_p}&lt;/math&gt;
and acts as an antisymmetrizer on {{math|''p''}} indices:
:&lt;math&gt;\delta^{\alpha_1 \cdots \alpha_p}_{\beta_1 \cdots \beta_p} \, A^{\beta_1 \cdots \beta_p} = A^{[\alpha_1 \cdots \alpha_p]} .&lt;/math&gt;

===[[Metric tensor]]===

The metric tensor {{math|''g''{{sub|''αβ''}}}} is used for lowering indices and gives the length of any [[space-like]] curve
:&lt;math&gt;\text{length} = \int^{y_2}_{y_1} \sqrt{ g_{\alpha \beta} \frac{d x^{\alpha}}{d y} \frac{d x^{\beta}}{d y} } \, d y \,,&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''y''}} is any [[Smooth function|smooth]] [[Monotonic function|strictly monotone]] [[parameterization]] of the path. It also gives the duration of any [[time-like]] curve
:&lt;math&gt;\text{duration} = \int^{t_2}_{t_1} \sqrt{ \frac{-1}{c^2} g_{\alpha \beta} \frac{d x^{\alpha}}{d t} \frac{d x^{\beta}}{d t} } \, d t \,,&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''t''}} is any smooth strictly monotone parameterization of the trajectory. See also [[line element]].

The [[inverse matrix]] {{math|''g''{{sup|''αβ''}}}} of the metric tensor is another important tensor, used for raising indices:
:&lt;math&gt; g^{\alpha \beta} g_{\beta \gamma} = \delta^{\alpha}_{\gamma} \,.&lt;/math&gt;

===[[Riemann curvature tensor]]===

If this tensor is defined as
:&lt;math&gt;R^\rho{}_{\sigma\mu\nu} = \Gamma^\rho{}_{\nu\sigma,\mu}
    - \Gamma^\rho{}_{\mu\sigma,\nu}
    + \Gamma^\rho{}_{\mu\lambda}\Gamma^\lambda{}_{\nu\sigma}
    - \Gamma^\rho{}_{\nu\lambda}\Gamma^\lambda{}_{\mu\sigma} \,,
&lt;/math&gt;

then it is the [[commutator]] of the covariant derivative with itself:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Synge J.L. |author2=Schild A. |publisher=first Dover Publications 1978 edition |title=Tensor Calculus |pages=83, p. 107|year= 1949}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=P. A. M. Dirac|pages=20–21| title=General Theory of Relativity| publisher= | isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;A_{\nu ; \rho \sigma} - A_{\nu ; \sigma \rho} = A_{\beta} R^{\beta}{}_{\nu \rho \sigma} \,,&lt;/math&gt;

since the [[Connection (mathematics)|connection]] {{math|Γ''&lt;sup&gt;α&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;βμ&lt;/sub&gt;''}} is torsionless, which means that the [[torsion tensor]]
:&lt;math&gt;\Gamma^\lambda{}_{\mu\nu} - \Gamma^\lambda{}_{\nu\mu}\,&lt;/math&gt;
vanishes.

This can be generalized to get the commutator for two covariant derivatives of an arbitrary tensor as follows:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
     &amp;T^{\alpha_1 \cdots \alpha_r}{}_{\beta_1 \cdots \beta_s ; \gamma \delta}
    - T^{\alpha_1 \cdots \alpha_r}{}_{\beta_1 \cdots \beta_s ; \delta \gamma} \\
  = - &amp;R^{\alpha_1}{}_{\rho \gamma \delta} T^{\rho \alpha_2 \cdots \alpha_r}{}_{\beta_1 \cdots \beta_s}
    - \cdots
    - R^{\alpha_r}{}_{\rho \gamma \delta} T^{\alpha_1 \cdots \alpha_{r-1} \rho}{}_{\beta_1 \cdots \beta_s} \\
  {}+{} &amp;R^\sigma{}_{\beta_1 \gamma \delta} T^{\alpha_1 \cdots \alpha_r}{}_{\sigma \beta_2 \cdots \beta_s}
    + \cdots
    + R^\sigma{}_{\beta_s \gamma \delta} T^{\alpha_1 \cdots \alpha_r}{}_{\beta_1 \cdots \beta_{s-1} \sigma} \,
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
which are often referred to as the ''Ricci identities''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Lovelock| first = David|author2=Hanno Rund | year=  1989|title = Tensors, Differential Forms, and Variational Principles|page=84}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="34431">{{International opposition to Apartheid}}
'''[[Rugby union]] and [[apartheid]]''' had a complex relationship. From 1948 to 1994, international rugby relations with the country, and also the non-integrated nature of [[rugby within South Africa]] drew frequent controversy. [[South African Rugby Board|South Africa]] remained a member of the [[International Rugby Board]] (IRB) throughout the apartheid era.

[[Halt All Racist Tours]] was established in New Zealand in 1969 to oppose continued tours to and from South Africa. Though contacts were restricted after the [[Gleneagles Agreement]] in 1977, there were controversial tours in 1980 [[1980 British Lions tour to South Africa|by the British Lions]] and [[1980 France rugby union tour of South Africa|by France]], in 1981 [[1981 Ireland rugby union tour of South Africa|by Ireland]], and in 1984 [[1984 England rugby union tour of South Africa|by England]]. South Africa toured [[1981 South Africa rugby union tour of New Zealand|New Zealand in 1981]]. [[South Africa national rugby union team|South Africa]] were excluded from the first two [[Rugby World Cup]]s, in [[1987 Rugby World Cup|1987]] and [[1991 Rugby World Cup|1991]]. Racially selected New Zealand sports teams toured South Africa until the 1970 [[All Blacks]] rugby tour allowed [[Māori people|Māori]] to go under the status of '[[honorary whites]]'.

No other issue, political or otherwise has divided the rugby community so much, at least not since the great schism with [[rugby league]] over professionalism. While many rugby fans and commentators would try and body swerve politics, at least politics of a certain kind, the apartheid issue brought it right into the heart of the game, in a very direct, and often physical way. The issue particularly came to the fore in the seventies and eighties. Unlike the split in the rugby world though, the apartheid issue attracted considerable interest from outside the sporting world.

The issue affected not only black South Africans, but also [[Māori people|indigenous New Zealanders]] and to a lesser extent [[indigenous Australians]]. Many major rugby union international sides had few non-white players, but theoretically, a side such as {{nrut|Fiji}} would be frowned upon.

The famous Scottish rugby commentator, [[Bill McLaren]], devotes an entire chapter to the subject in his autobiography, ''Talking of Rugby'', called "Barred from the International Feast". Like many other rugby fans, he expresses contempt for South Africa's "''unacceptable racist policy''", but adds "''it has been a disgrace that a world Rugby Union power has been eliminated from world competition for all those years.''"&lt;ref name=mclaren&gt;McLaren, p145&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ian Robertson (rugby commentator)|Ian Robertson]], documented how the Springboks' position slowly deteriorated over the decades, but suggested that the fault lay outwith the rugby fraternity:

{{quote|The Springboks had fulfilled all of their touring commitments through the Fifties and Sixties but the oppressive, claustrophobic political pressures overwhelmed them during the Seventies. They have not been able to play in Britain, Ireland, France or Australia since 1974, and their only major tour abroad in the last ten years to New Zealand in 1981, was full of controversy, and mass demonstrations. There is no doubt that giant steps have been taken to make Rugby totally integrated in South Africa in recent years, and their supporters feel that no sooner have they fulfilled the conditions required of them by world opinion than the goalposts are moved.

Their opponents, who are against having any sporting links with a country which practises apartheid, accept that sport in South Africa has become increasingly integrated but claim it is impossible to have normal sport in an abnormal society.&lt;ref&gt;Rugby a way of life, p112-3&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Apartheid South Africa's last foreign tour was [[1981 South Africa rugby union tour of New Zealand|to New Zealand in 1981]].

==Governing bodies==
Like most other institutions in South Africa, the South African rugby bodies were divided along racial lines:

* The [[South African Rugby Board]] (SARB) for whites,&lt;ref name=Hopkins20&gt;Hopkins, p20&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[South African Rugby Football Federation|South African Rugby Federation]] (SARF) for "coloureds" i.e. people considered to be of mixed race.&lt;ref name=Hopkins20/&gt;
* The [[South African African Rugby Board|South African Rugby Association]] (SARA) (originally the South African African Rugby Board) for blacks.&lt;ref name=Hopkins20/&gt;

There was also the [[South African Rugby Union (SACOS)|South African Rugby Union]] (SARU), which was a non-racial body, with a considerable membership.&lt;ref name=Hopkins20/&gt; However, only the SARB had any say in international tours, and they alone chose the national team.

At the end of the 1970s, the SARB took over the SARF and SARA, but Abdul Abbas, leader of SARU refused to co-operate with the new board until the game was integrated at club level and certain political laws scrapped.&lt;ref name=Hopkins20/&gt;

==British and Irish Lions==
The [[British and Irish Lions]] were regular visitors to South Africa until the 1980s, and the less formally segregated colony long before that. Their fondness for South Africa no doubt stemmed from the fact that the first tour they made was to South Africa. They would alternate these tours with tours to Australia and/or New Zealand.

In the years 1948-1980, the Lions made no less than five tours to South Africa, more or less one for every decade, and half of their total ten tours in this period. Their first tour in this period was in [[1955 British Lions tour to South Africa|1955]], seven years after the formal inauguration of apartheid. They made further tours in [[1962 British Lions tour to South Africa|1962]], [[1968 British Lions tour to South Africa|1968]], [[1974 British Lions tour to South Africa|1974]] and one final one in [[1980 British Lions tour to South Africa|1980]]. The controversy caused by this matter meant that the Lions would not go back there until their [[1997 British Lions tour to South Africa|1997 tour]] when the South Africa team was ostensibly mixed.

The Lions would have toured South Africa in 1986 if the regular schedule had been kept to but in December 1985 the [[South African Rugby Board]] announced they would not be inviting the Lions side to tour South Africa the following year. Political objections to South Africa's [[apartheid]] policies including a potential boycott of the [[1986 Commonwealth Games]] and state of emergency in South Africa at the time lay behind this decision. The squad selected for this International Rugby Board centenary was the closest thing to an official 1986 British Lions side. It was managed by [[Clive Rowlands]] and coached by [[Mick Doyle (rugby union)|Mick Doyle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Griffiths|first=John|title=The Lions tour that never was, Cecil Afrika's Sevens' career and Shane Williams' try-scoring rate|url=http://www.espnscrum.com/scrum/rugby/story/155605.html#|work=espnscrum.com|accessdate=26 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 21 players selected were issued with Lions' blazers and ties and considered to be official British Lions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The History of the British and Irish Lions|year=2005|publisher=Mainstream Publishing|location=Edinburgh|isbn=1-84596-030-0|pages=202|author=Clem Thomas|author-link=Clem Thomas}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Māori and apartheid==
&lt;!-- Commented out: [[File:NoMaorisNoTour.jpg|thumb|left|Early activism over the issue of sporting contacts with apartheid South Africa]] --&gt;
New Zealand has a long history of sporting contact with [[South Africa]], especially through [[rugby union]]. Until the 1970s this resulted in discrimination against [[Māori people|Māori]] players, since the [[apartheid]] political system in South Africa for most of the twentieth century did not allow people of different races to play sport together, and therefore South African officials requested that Māori players not be included in sides which toured their country. Despite some of New Zealand's best players being Māori, this was agreed to, and Māori were excluded from tours of South Africa. Some Māori always objected to this, but it did not become a major issue until 1960, when there were several public protests at Māori exclusion from that year's tour. The protest group [[Halt All Racist Tours]] was formed in 1969. Although this was an issue in which Māori were central, and Māori were involved in the protests, the anti-tour movement was dominated by [[Pākehā]] (white New Zealanders).

In 1973 a proposed [[South Africa national rugby union team|Springbok]] (South African rugby team) tour of New Zealand was cancelled. In 1976 the South African government relented and allowed a mixed-race [[All Black]] team to tour South Africa. However, by this time international opinion had turned against any sporting contact with South Africa, and New Zealand faced significant international pressure to cut ties. Despite this, in 1981 the Springboks toured New Zealand, sparking mass protests and [[civil disobedience]]. Although Pākehā continued to dominate the movement, Māori were prominent within it, and in [[Auckland]] formed the [[patu]] squad in order to remain autonomous within the wider movement.

During and after the Tour, many Māori protesters questioned Pākehā protesters' commitment to racial equality, accusing them of focusing on racism in other countries while ignoring it within New Zealand. The majority of Pākehā protesters were not heavily involved in protest after the Tour ended, but a significant minority, including several anti-Tour groups, turned their attention to New Zealand race issues, particularly Pākehā prejudice and the [[Treaty of Waitangi]].

==1950s==
South Africa's isolation in sport began in the mid-1950s and increased throughout the 1960s. Apartheid forbade multiracial sport, which meant that overseas teams, by virtue of their having players of diverse races, could not play in South Africa. In 1956, the [[International Table Tennis Federation]] severed its ties with the all-white South African Table Tennis Union, preferring the non-racial South African Table Tennis Board. The apartheid government responded by confiscating the passports of the Board's players so that they were unable to attend international games.

In April 2010 it was revealed by [[Muru Walters]] that in 1956 [[Ernest Corbett]], [[Minister of Māori Affairs]], had told the [[New Zealand Māori rugby union team|Māori All Blacks]] to deliberately lose to the [[South Africa national rugby union team|Springboks]] "for the future of rugby". The Māori team lost 37-0. This was followed by Walters calling for the New Zealand government to apologise for the way it treated Māori rugby players.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/sport/news/article.cfm?c_id=4&amp;objectid=10638078|title=Rugby: Maori told to throw match against Boks|work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]|date=13 April 2010|accessdate=14 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==1960s==
Foreign complaints about South Africa's bigoted sports brought more isolation. In 1960, [[Hendrik Frensch Verwoerd|Verwoerd]] barred a [[Māori people|Māori]] [[Rugby union|rugby]] player from touring South Africa with the [[All Blacks]], and the tour was cancelled. [[New Zealand]] made a decision not to convey an authorised rugby team to South Africa again.

In 1961, South Africa left the Commonwealth, signifying a break with many of the major rugby playing nations.

In 1963, [[Lloyd McDermott]], the first Australian aborigine on the {{nrut|Australia}} team refused to go on a tour of South Africa, and switched to [[rugby league]] as a result.

[[B. J. Vorster]] took Verwoerd's place as PM in 1966 and declared that South Africa would no longer dictate to other countries what their teams should look like. Although this reopened the gate for sporting meets, it did not signal the end of South Africa's racist sporting policies. In 1968, Vorster went against his policy by refusing to permit [[Basil D'Oliveira]], a [[Cape Coloured|Coloured]] South African-born cricketer, to join the English cricket team on its tour to South Africa. Vorster said that the side had been chosen only to prove a point, and not on merit. After protests, however, "Dolly" was eventually included in the team. Protests against certain tours brought about the cancellation of a number of other visits, like that of an England rugby team in 1969/70.

[[Ian Robertson (rugby commentator)|Ian Robertson]] describes the scene at [[Murrayfield Stadium|Murrayfield]] in [[Edinburgh]] in 1969:

&lt;blockquote&gt;There was a huge police presence at the ground, with the terraces behind both sets of goalposts reserved exclusively for officers of the law with standing spectators restricted to just the East Terrace.&lt;ref&gt;Rugby a way of life, p112&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In March 1973, the Argentine government and the [[Union Argentina de Rugby]] had a great conflict: the government contested to UAR the permit given to [[San Isidro Club]] to visit South Africa, and forced the federal committee of UAR to resign. A new committee was elected on 24 April 1973. In November the government also forbade all visits to [[South Africa]] by any Argentine team and any visit of a South African team into Argentina. This ban remained until 1991.

South Africa was the indirect cause of the [[1976 Olympic boycott]]. A [[1976 New Zealand rugby union tour of South Africa|New Zealand rugby union tour of South Africa]] prompted African countries to demand that the [[New Zealand at the 1976 Summer Olympics|New Zealand Olympic team]] be excluded from the games. The IOC demurred on the grounds that [[rugby union]] was not an [[Olympic sport]] and the [[New Zealand Rugby Union]] was not affiliated to the [[New Zealand Olympic Committee]].&lt;ref&gt;Espy 181, pp.157–8&lt;/ref&gt; Of 28 African invitees, 26 boycotted the Games, joined by Iraq and Guyana.

In February, 1977, [[Danie Craven]] flew to London to plead for South African rugby's reintegration into the international scene, and to make a last ditch attempt to save the Springboks' scheduled tour of the British Isles in 1978, and the [[British and Irish Lions]] tour of South Africa in 1980.

&lt;blockquote&gt;For the first time I no longer have to circumvent questions, I can at long last look everybody in the face. It is really a disgrace that we in South Africa have tolerated putting the Blacks and Coloured in a place, perhaps the worst place imaginable in our rugby grounds. We are now closing a book and entering a new era. South Africa will never be the same again. You know we must make changes towards a multi-racial deal not to placate or pander to overseas opinion but because it is the right and just thing.&lt;ref name=Hopkins20/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, some, such as [[Chris Laidlaw]], later a Labour MP in New Zealand, had had enough, and believed that rugby's failure to engage with the issue properly was harming the sport:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Times have changed, however. Youth has begun to write its own rules and by the 1970s the conventions of the rugby community had begun to look a little creaky, its formalities became a bore. The cleavage was brought into sharp relief by the tragic failure of rugby to come to grips with the problem of racism in Southern Africa. The emerging reputation of the rugby player throughout the Anglo-Saxon world as an outdated, boorish oaf – a reputation derived as much from the insensitivities of the rugby community as from the intolerance of the younger generation - was given a new dimension by the quarrels over apartheid in sport. Rightly or wrongly, it has dealt the image of rugby a vicious blow, one from which it may never really recover. South Africa has now been exposed for what it really is, a malignant cancer in the corpus of rugby which has long called for the surgeon's knife. Yet the rugby community - most notably in New Zealand - still remains fatally hesitant when it comes to acting as doctor.&lt;ref&gt;[[Chris Laidlaw|Laidlaw, Chris]] ''From Twickers with Love: Rugby's Universal Message'' in Hopkins, John (ed) ''Rugby'' (1979 {{ISBN|0-304-30299-6}}), p54&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

But there were criticisms of the behaviour of some of the protesters too. [[Bill McLaren]] thought apartheid was "unacceptable", but:

{{quote|...some of the actions adopted by those aiming to stop tours were despicable.

Bette [Bill McLaren's wife] and I were referred to as 'racist scum' on our way down to Mansfield Park to see the South African Barbarians play in 1979 – a tour party comprising equal numbers of coloureds, blacks and whites. That, said the protesters, was just window dressing. When the Springboks last toured the UK, I was asked to provide commentary on their match against the Midland Counties (East) at Welford Road, [[Leicester]]. I remember having to walk the gauntlet up a narrow channel lined on each side by policemen holding back the mob. Those policemen were covered in spittle, had hats knocked off, were kicked in places where no man should be kicked, and yet took it all with stoic calm. I couldn't believe that people in the British Isles would behaved in that manner.... Constant noise outside the South Africans' hotels to try and prevent them sleeping was another unbelievable ploy that sickened decent people.&lt;ref name=Mclaren2&gt;McLaren, p137-8&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==1980s==
Though contacts were restricted after the [[Gleneagles Agreement]] in 1977, there were controversial tours in 1980 [[1980 British Lions tour to South Africa|by the British Lions]] and [[1980 France rugby union tour of South Africa|by France]], in 1981 [[1981 Ireland rugby union tour of South Africa|by Ireland]], and in 1984 [[1984 England rugby union tour of South Africa|by England]]. In 1986, though a Lions tour was cancelled, South Africans played in all-star matches [[Rest of the World XV|in Cardiff]] and [[Overseas Unions rugby union team|in London]] marking the IRB centenary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Starmer-Smith|first=Nigel|authorlink=Nigel Starmer-Smith|title=Rugby - A Way of Life, An Illustrated History of Rugby|year=1986 |publisher=Lennard Books|isbn=0-7126-2662-X|page=186}}&lt;/ref&gt;  South Africa was excluded from the first two [[Rugby World Cup]]s, in [[1987 Rugby World Cup|1987]] and [[1991 Rugby World Cup|1991]].

In 1982 the political relationship between Australia and Argentina was also damaged due to the [[Falklands War]].

The {{nrut|Soviet Union}} supposedly turned down its invitation to the [[1987 Rugby World Cup]], because of its distaste for the ''[[apartheid]]'' regime of [[South Africa]]. However, South Africa was not invited in the end. While the ''[[Great Soviet Encyclopedia]]'' states that rugby is popular in Great Britain, New Zealand, France, Romania and Australia, it tellingly makes no mention of South Africa.&lt;ref name=GSE1&gt;Sorokin, px&lt;/ref&gt; Chris Thau says that France approached the USSR before 1987 on the issue, and that the Soviets said that they would be happy to participate if South Africa was not invited.&lt;ref name=ThauSovRug2&gt;Thau, ''Soviet Rugby'', p 47&lt;/ref&gt; In the end, South Africa was not invited, but the USSR did not attend either. It has been said that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;No nation outside the Third World did more than the USSR to oppose ''apartheid'' in sport and have South Africa banned from world sports forums and arenas.&lt;ref name=Cambridge494&gt;Cambridge, p494&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Soviets leaned on other nations heavily:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Over the years, [[Albert Ferasse|Ferasse]] has resisted Eastern Bloc pressure to break with South Africa. At one point Moscow threatened to set up a rival Federation, but the Rumanians, with whom the French have long had good relationships, stood by France. Moscow tried again later by threatening to call off the {{nrut|France}} v. {{nrut|USSR}} match in [[Toulouse]] in November 1978. Once again Ferasse held firm and the Russians went to France, where they were beaten 29-7&lt;ref&gt;Hopkins, P24&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In September 1981, {{nrut|South Africa}} was due to play the Mid-West in [[Chicago]]. To avoid protestors, they drove 77 miles to [[Racine, Wisconsin|Racine]] and played in front of 247 spectators, winning 46-12. By the time they returned to Chicago, none of the protestors knew that the game had happened.&lt;ref name=RugbyDis1&gt;Cotton, p29&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989 a [[World XV]], sanctioned by the IRB and funded by [[South African Breweries]], played two tests against South Africa in 1989 in celebration of the centenary of the [[South African Rugby Board]] (SARB). The Springboks won both, by 20-19 at [[Newlands Stadium]] in [[Cape Town]] and the second test 22-16 on September 2 at Ellis Park in [[Johannesburg]] .

====South Africa in New Zealand, 1981====
{{main|1981 South Africa rugby union tour}}
[[File:1981-springbok-tour-auckland-kingsland-station.jpg|thumb|right|Police officers guarding a barbed wire perimeter around [[Eden Park]] near [[Kingsland railway station, New Zealand|Kingsland railway station]] in New Zealand.]]

The 1981 Springboks tour of New Zealand was compromised by demonstrations, and the tourists had to be kept under strict security throughout their visit.&lt;ref name=Griffiths260&gt;Griffiths, p260-1&lt;/ref&gt;

Two games had to be cancelled.&lt;ref name=Griffiths260/&gt; The game at Hamilton in the first week of the tour saw 200 protestors rip down a chain fence, sprinkle tacks all over the pitch and then staged a sit-in on the half way line. At the time, a crowd of 25,000 was watching them playing Waikato. Subsequent matches saw the arrival of barbed wire, and police with batons. The match against South Canterbury at [[Timaru]] was cancelled because the authorities thought that they would not be able to control the demonstrations there.&lt;ref name=Griffiths260/&gt;

The final test of the tour was buzzed by a Cessna aircraft - some in fact nicknamed it the "Crazy [[Biggles]] Test". The plane continually strafed the pitch, and dropped flour bombs, flares and leaflets.&lt;ref name=Griffiths260/&gt; All-Black prop [[Gary Knight (rugby player)|Gary Knight]] was temporarily stunned by a flour bomb.&lt;ref name=Griffiths260/&gt;

Musician [[Bruce Russell (musician)|Bruce Russell]] received two police convictions as a student leader of protests against the tour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wood|first=Luke|title=The Aesthetics of Distribution: a conversation with Bruce Russell|url=http://www.audiofoundation.org.nz/nat_grid1.html|work=The National Grid|accessdate=28 June 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130209182453/http://audiofoundation.org.nz/nat_grid1.html|archive-date=9 February 2013|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was at the [[University of Otago]] at the time.

It was a tight game, with [[Allan Hewson]], the New Zealand full-back kicking a long range penalty to win the game 25–22.&lt;ref name=Griffiths260/&gt; As Rod Chester and Nev McMillan described the scene:

&lt;blockquote&gt;There will probably never be another Test match like this. The tension generated by the closeness and importance of the game, combined with the efforts of the protestors inside, outside and above the ground, made for an exhilarating and yet terrifying afternoon.&lt;ref name=Griffiths260/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The role of the [[NZ police]] also became more controversial as a result of the tour.

The [[NZRFU]] constitution contained much high-minded wording about promoting the image of rugby and New Zealand, and generally being a benefit to society. In 1985 the NZRFU proposed an All Black tour of South Africa that remobilised New Zealand protesters. [[Finnigan v New Zealand Rugby Football Union|Two lawyers successfully sued it]], claiming such a tour would breach its constitution. The High Court stopped the tour.

====New Zealand Cavaliers====
A "rebel tour" not government sanctioned went ahead in 1986, but after that sporting ties were cut, and New Zealand made a decision not to convey an authorised rugby team to South Africa until the end of apartheid.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nzhistory.net.nz/culture/1981-springbok-tour The 1981 Springbok rugby tour – A country divided]. New Zealand History Online.&lt;/ref&gt; This followed the intensely controversial 1981 South African tour New Zealand which had provoked nationwide protest and world-wide condemnation. The Cavaliers tour was very controversial within New Zealand and the players found that support for their actions was far less than they had expected. This controversy meant there were no future rugby contacts until the South African apartheid regime ended.

The All Blacks did not tour South Africa until after the fall of the [[apartheid]] régime (1990–1994), although after the 1985 tour was cancelled an unofficial tour took place in 1986 by a team that included 28 out of the 30 All Blacks selected for the 1985 tour, known as the [[New Zealand Cavaliers]] but often advertised in [[South Africa]] as the All Blacks or depicted with the Silver Fern.

Of the 30 players who had been selected for the [[All Blacks|All Black]] tour, only [[David Kirk]] and [[John Kirwan (rugby)|John Kirwan]] did not join the Cavaliers. The rebel team were widely believed to have received large secret payments&amp;mdash;a controversial issue at a time when rugby union was still supposedly an amateur sport [http://www.nzhistory.net.nz/media/photo/cavaliers-rugby-tour-1985]

On their return, the NZRFU barred all the players from participating in the next two All Black tests, and instead selected a new group of players. Most of these replacement players were younger, and were quickly dubbed the "Baby Blacks". Those new All Blacks went on to form the basis of one of the most successful periods in All Black rugby, which resulted in many Cavalier players struggling to get their places back.

====[[South American Jaguars]]====
The Jaguars consisted mainly of Argentine rugby players, but also with some from Uruguay, Brazil, Paraguay and Chile.

While many of these countries suffered from dictatorships, they too had sporting bans of a sort. The Jaguars were not officially recognized by [[Union Argentina de Rugby]], a stratagem to elude the prohibition of the Argentine government that since the early 1970s forbade any official relationship between any Argentine sport federation and South African and [[Rhodesia]]n ones, due to the politics of those countries.  This ostracism started in 1971 when the Argentine government forbade the ''Pumas'' to play a match in Rhodesia during the [[1971 Argentina rugby union tour of South Africa|tour in South Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uar.com.ar/pdf/memorias/1971.pdf Union Argentina dr Rugby Memorias 1971] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121101073132/http://uar.com.ar/pdf/memorias/1971.pdf |date=2012-11-01 }} pag.9&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-apartheid era==

===[[1995 Rugby World Cup]]===
{{see also|Presidency of Nelson Mandela}}
After his election in 1994, [[Nelson Mandela]] encouraged black South Africans to get behind the previously hated national rugby team, the [[South African national rugby union team|Springboks]], as South Africa hosted the [[1995 Rugby World Cup]].

Prior to the World Cup in 1995, the Springboks were only seeded ninth and were not expected to dethrone the incumbent champions [[Australia national rugby union team|Australia]], who had not lost a game in the preceding 12 months.

During the tournament, South Africa defeated Australia, [[Romania national rugby union team|Romania]], [[Canada national rugby union team|Canada]], [[Samoa national rugby union team|Western Samoa]] and [[France national rugby union team|France]]. They then met [[New Zealand national rugby union team|New Zealand]] in the [[1995 Rugby World Cup#Final|1995 Rugby World Cup Final]] at [[Ellis Park Stadium]]. Springbok captain Francois Pienaar played on in extra-time despite a calf strain and the Springboks secured a three-point victory with a [[drop goal]] from [[Joel Stransky]].

During the remarkable post-match presentation ceremony, Nelson Mandela presented Pienaar with the [[Webb Ellis Cup]] while wearing a Springbok jersey bearing Pienaar's own number 6. During his acceptance speech, Pienaar made it clear that the team had won the trophy not just for the 60,000 fans at Ellis Park, but also for all 43,000,000 South Africans.

This was widely seen as a major step in the reconciliation of white and black South Africans; as [[F.W. de Klerk]] later put it, "Mandela won the hearts of millions of white rugby fans."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sampson|2011|p=524}}; {{harvnb|Meredith|2010|pp=525–527}}; {{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/rugby_union/rugby_world_cup/team_pages/south_africa/3167692.stm|title=Mandela rallies Springboks|date=6 October 2003|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=28 October 2008|archivedate=25 February 2013|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6EhlM6rLh?url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/rugby_union/rugby_world_cup/team_pages/south_africa/3167692.stm|deadurl=no|df=dmy-all}}; {{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/portal/main.jhtml?view=DETAILS&amp;grid=&amp;xml=/portal/2007/10/19/ftmandela119.xml |title=How Nelson Mandela won the rugby World Cup |date=19 October 2007 |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |accessdate=28 October 2008 |first=John |last=Carlin |archivedate=25 February 2013 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6EhlMWoPg?url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/features/3634426/How-Nelson-Mandela-won-the-rugby-World-Cup.html |deadurl=no |df=dmy-all }}; {{harvnb|Sampson|2011|p=516}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mandela's efforts at reconciliation assuaged the fears of whites, but also drew criticism from more militant blacks. His estranged wife, [[Winnie Mandela|Winnie]], accused the [[ANC]] of being more interested in appeasing whites than in helping blacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sampson|2011|pp=491, 496, 524}}; {{harvnb|Meredith|2010|pp=517, 536}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

These events, along with the relationship between Mandela and Pienaar, were the subject of a 2008 book by John Carlin, ''Playing the Enemy: Nelson Mandela and the Game that Made a Nation'', that spotlights the role of the 1995 Cup win in post-[[Apartheid in South Africa|apartheid South Africa]].

{{Sex differences}}

Differences in [[human intelligence]] have long been a topic of debate among researchers and scholars. With the advent of the concept of ''g'' or [[general intelligence]], many researchers have argued for no significant sex differences in [[g factor (psychometrics)|''g'' factor]] or general intelligence,&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; while others have argued for greater intelligence for males, &lt;ref name="Lynn2005"/&gt; and others for females.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The split view between these researchers depended on the methodology&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; and tests they used for their claims.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; One study found some advantage for women in later life,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.intell.2007.11.001 |title=Sex differences in latent cognitive abilities ages 6 to 59: Evidence from the Woodcock–Johnson III tests of cognitive abilities |year=2008 |last1=Keith |first1=Timothy Z. |last2=Reynolds |first2=Matthew R. |last3=Patel |first3=Puja G. |last4=Ridley |first4=Kristen P. |journal=Intelligence |volume=36 |issue=6 |pages=502–25}}&lt;/ref&gt; while another found that male advantages on some [[cognitive tests]] are minimized when controlling for socioeconomic factors.&lt;ref name="jorm"&gt;{{cite journal |doi = 10.1016/j.intell.2003.08.001|title = Gender differences in cognitive abilities: The mediating role of health state and health habits|year = 2004|last1 = Jorm|first1 = Anthony F.|last2 = Anstey|first2 = Kaarin J.|last3 = Christensen|first3 = Helen|last4 = Rodgers|first4 = Bryan|journal = Intelligence|volume = 32|pages = 7–23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some studies have concluded that there is [[Variability hypothesis|larger variability]] in male scores compared to female scores, which results in more males than females in the [[Intellectual giftedness|top]] and bottom of the IQ distribution.&lt;ref name="Deary"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WaiCacchio2010"/&gt;  Additionally, there are differences in the capacity of males and females in performing certain tasks, such as rotation of objects in space, often categorized as [[spatial ability]].

== Historical perspectives ==

Prior to the 20th century, it was a commonly held view that men were intellectually superior to women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lips|first1=Hilary M.|title=Sex &amp; Gender: An Introduction|date=1997|publisher=Mayfield|location=Mountain View, Calif.|isbn=1559346302|page=40|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Denmark|first1=Florence L.|last2=Paludi|first2=Michele A.|title=Psychology of Women: A Handbook of Issues and Theories|date=2008|publisher=Praeger|location=Westport, Conn.|isbn=0275991628|pages=7–11|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1801, [[Thomas Gisborne]] said that women were naturally suited to domestic work and not spheres suited to men such as politics, science, or business. He stated that this was because women did not possess the same level of rational thinking that men did and had naturally superior abilities in skills related to family support.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Gisborne, An enquiry into the duties of the female sex, Printed by A. Strahan for T. Cadell jun. and W. Davies, 1801{{page needed|date=June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1875, [[Herbert Spencer]] said that women were incapable of abstract thought and could not understand issues of justice and had only the ability to understand issues of care.&lt;ref name="Worell"&gt;Judith Worell, Encyclopedia of women and gender: sex similarities and differences and the impact of society on gender, Volume 1, Elsevier, 2001, {{ISBN|0-12-227246-3}}, {{ISBN|978-0-12-227246-2}}{{page needed|date=June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1925, [[Sigmund Freud]] also stated that women were less morally developed in the concept of justice and, unlike men, were more influenced by feeling than rational thought.&lt;ref name="Worell"/&gt; Early brain studies comparing mass and volumes between the sexes concluded that women were intellectually inferior because [[Brain size#Sex|they have smaller and lighter brains]].&lt;ref name="Fine"&gt;{{cite book|last=Fine|first=Cordelia|authorlink=Cordelia Fine|title = [[Delusions of Gender|Delusions of Gender: How Our Minds, Society, and Neurosexism Create Difference]]| publisher =W. W. Norton|year=2010|isbn=0-393-06838-2}}{{page needed|date=June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many believed that the size difference caused women to be excitable, emotional, sensitive, and therefore not suited for political participation.&lt;ref name="Grandner"/&gt;

In the nineteenth century, whether men and women had equal intelligence was seen by many as a prerequisite for the granting of [[suffrage]].&lt;ref name="Grandner"&gt;Margarete Grandner, Austrian women in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries: cross-disciplinary perspectives, Berghahn Books, 1996, {{ISBN|1-57181-045-5}}, {{ISBN|978-1-57181-045-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Leta Hollingworth]] argued that women were not permitted to realize their full [[potential]], as they were confined to the roles of child-rearing and [[housekeeping]].

He did, however, find "rather marked" differences on a minority of tests. For example, he found boys were "decidedly better" in arithmetical reasoning, while girls were "superior" at answering comprehension questions. He also proposed that discrimination, lack of opportunity, women's responsibilities in motherhood, or emotional factors may have accounted for the fact that few women had careers in intellectual fields.&lt;ref name="Terman"&gt;{{cite book |last=Terman |first=Lewis M. |year=1916 |title=The measurement of intelligence: an explanation of and a complete guide for the use of the Stanford revision and extension of the Binet-Simon intelligence scale |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |location=Boston |pages=68–72 |oclc=186102}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the 1994 report ''[[Intelligence: Knowns and Unknowns]]'' by the [[American Psychological Association]], "Most standard tests of intelligence have been constructed so that there are no overall score differences between females and males."

Aside from traditional IQ tests like [[Raven's Progressive Matrices|Raven's]] and [[Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale|WAIS]], researchers have also used other tests that tap more into the [[Cattell–Horn–Carroll theory|Cattell-Horn-Caroll theory]] of intelligence in relation to gender.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; For example, a 2008 study by researcher [[Timothy Z. Keith]] on 25 subtests of [[Woodcock–Johnson Tests of Cognitive Abilities|Woodcock-Johnson Tests of Cognitive Abilities]], along with a sample of 6,818 adults and children from 6 to 59, found females scoring higher on the latent [[Processing fluency|processing speed]] (Gs) factor, a small male advantage on the [[Latent variable|latent]] comprehension–knowledge (Gc) factor, higher male score on the latent visual–spatial reasoning (Gv) and higher male latent quantitative reasoning (RQ) factor.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Sex differences in latent cognitive abilities ages 6 to 59: Evidence from the Woodcock–Johnson III tests of cognitive abilities|url = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222660770_Sex_differences_in_latent_cognitive_abilities_ages_6_to_59_Evidence_from_the_WoodcockJohnson_III_tests_of_cognitive_abilities|journal = Intelligence|pages = 502–525|volume = 36|issue = 6|doi = 10.1016/j.intell.2007.11.001|first = Timothy Z.|last = Keith|first2 = Matthew R.|last2 = Reynolds|first3 = Puja G.|last3 = Patel|first4 = Kristen P.|last4 = Ridley|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study found no difference in latent [[Long-term memory|long-term retrieval]] (Glr), [[short-term memory]] (Gsm), auditory processing (Ga)  and [[Fluid and crystallized intelligence|fluid intelligence]] (Gf) factors.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; However the sex difference in [[G factor (psychometrics)|general intelligence]] (g-factor) was inconsistent in children with small higher female [[G factor (psychometrics)|''g'' factor]] during adolescence, and consistent higher female [[Latent variable|latent ''g'' factor]] during adulthood.

=== Debate and division among researchers ===
The current literature on sex differences produced inconsistent results depending on the type of testing used.&lt;ref name="Lynn2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Among the researchers who conducted studies on intelligence, many state that there are no sex differences in [[G factor (psychometrics)|g]] (Jensen 1998, Colom, Garcia, Juan-Esponiza &amp; Abad 2000, Colom, Garcia, Juan-Esponiza &amp; Abad 2002, Camarata and Woodcock 2006), some found a difference favoring males (Lynn 1999, Lynn Irwing 2004, 2008) and some found a difference favoring females (Keith, Reynolds, Patel &amp; Ridley 2006 and Reynolds, Keith, Ridley, Patel 2006).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Wiley-Blackwell Handbook of Individual Differences|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=F_SyBwAAQBAJ|publisher = John Wiley &amp; Sons|date = 2015-06-22|isbn = 9781119050308|language = en|first = Tomas|last = Chamorro-Premuzic|first2 = Sophie von|last2 = Stumm|first3 = Adrian|last3 = Furnham}}&lt;/ref&gt; The issues remains unresolved if one uses standardized tests as Jensen (1998) and Colom, Garcia (2002) agrees that there might be a small insignificant sex difference in ''intelligence in general'' (IQ) but this may not necessarily reflect a sex difference in ''general intelligence'' ([[G factor (psychometrics)|''g'' factor]]).&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; The difference between the two concepts is that IQ is a psychometric scoring system measured with standardized testing, while ''g'' factor is a [[Latent variable|latent]] scientific construct that correlates with all cognitive tests and achievements in life. Although most researchers distinguish between ''g'' and IQ, those that argue for greater male intelligence assert that IQ and ''g'' are synonymous (Lynn &amp; Irwing 2004) and so the real division comes from defining IQ in relation to ''g'' factor. However, in 2008 Lynn and Irwing proposed that since [[working memory]] ability correlate highest with ''g'' factor, researchers would have no choice but to accept greater male intelligence if differences on working memory tasks are found. As a result, a neuroimaging study published by Schmidt (2009) conducted an investigation into this proposal by measuring sex differences on an [[n-back]] working memory task. The results found no sex difference in working memory capacity and thus contradicting the position pushed forward by Lynn and Irwing (2008) and more in line with those arguing for no sex differences in intelligence.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = No gender differences in brain activation during the N-back task: an fMRI study in healthy individuals|journal = Human Brain Mapping|date = 2009-11-01|issn = 1097-0193|pmid = 19387979|pages = 3609–3615|volume = 30|issue = 11|doi = 10.1002/hbm.20783|first = Heike|last = Schmidt|first2 = Jigar|last2 = Jogia|first3 = Kristina|last3 = Fast|first4 = Tessa|last4 = Christodoulou|first5 = Morgan|last5 = Haldane|first6 = Veena|last6 = Kumari|first7 = Sophia|last7 = Frangou}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same results in the 2009 n-back working memory study have also been replicated in numerous other studies since.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Sex differences in the working memory of students in Ahmadu Bello University, Zaria, Nigeria using the N-b|url = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/272715709_Sex_differences_in_the_working_memory_of_students_in_Ahmadu_Bello_University_Zaria_Nigeria_using_the_N-b|journal = IOSR Journal of Dental and Medical Sciences|pages = 8–11|volume = 2|issue = 6|doi = 10.9790/0853-0260811|first = Tende,|last = J.

=== American Psychological Association ===
A 2012 review by researchers [[Richard E. Nisbett]], Joshua Aronson, Clancy Blair, William Dickens, [[Jim Flynn (academic)|James Flynn]], [[Diane F. Halpern]] and [[Eric Turkheimer]] discussed [[Arthur Jensen]]'s 1998 studies on sex differences in intelligence. Jensen's tests were significantly [[G factor (psychometrics)|g]] loaded but were not set-up to get rid of any sex differences (''read [[differential item functioning]]''). They summarized his conclusions as he quoted, "No evidence was found for sex differences in the mean level of g or in the variability of g. Males, on average, excel on some factors; females on others." Jensen’s results that no overall sex differences existed for ''g'' has been reinforced by researchers who analyzed this issue with a battery of 42 mental ability tests and found no overall sex difference.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The structure of human intelligence: It is verbal, perceptual, and image rotation (VPR), not fluid and crystallized|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160289605000139|journal = Intelligence|date = 2005-07-01|pages = 393–416|volume = 33|issue = 4|doi = 10.1016/j.intell.2004.12.002|first = Wendy|last = Johnson|first2 = Thomas J.|last2 = Bouchard Jr.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://psycnet.apa.org/record/2011-30298-001|title = Intelligence New Findings and Theoretical Developments|last = Nisbet|first = Richard E|date = 2012|journal = American Psychologist|doi = 10.1037/a0026699|pmid = 22233090|access-date =|volume=67|pages=130–59}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although most of the tests showed no difference, there were some that did. For example, they found female subjects performed better on verbal abilities while males performed better on visuospatial abilities.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; For verbal fluency, females have been specifically found to perform slightly better in vocabulary and reading comprehension but significantly higher in speech production and essay writing.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Women in Science and Mathematics|url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK23762/|date = 2006-01-01|first = National Academy of Sciences|last = (us)|first2 = National Academy of Engineering|last2 = (us)|first3 = and Institute of Medicine (US) Committee on Maximizing the Potential of Women in Academic Science and|last3 = Engineering}}&lt;/ref&gt; Males have been specifically found to perform better on spatial visualization, spatial perception, and mental rotation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Researchers had then recommended that general models such as [[Fluid and crystallized intelligence|fluid]] and [[Fluid and crystallized intelligence|crystallized intelligence]] be divided into [[Baddeley's model of working memory|verbal]], perceptual and [[Baddeley's model of working memory|visuospatial]] domains of [[G factor (psychometrics)|g]], because when this model is applied then females excel at verbal and perceptual tasks while males on visuospatial tasks,&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; thus evening out the sex differences on IQ tests.

=== Variability ===
{{Main|Variability hypothesis}}
Some studies have identified the degree of IQ [[variance]] as a difference between males and females. Males tend to show greater variability on many traits, for example having both highest and lowest scores on tests of cognitive abilities,&lt;ref name="WaiCacchio2010"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wai|first1=Jonathan|last2=Cacchio|first2=Megan|last3=Putallaz|first3=Martha|last4=Makel|first4=Matthew C.|title=Sex differences in the right tail of cognitive abilities: A 30year examination|journal=Intelligence|volume=38|issue=4|year=2010|pages=412–423|issn=0160-2896|doi=10.1016/j.intell.2010.04.006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lehrke, R. 1997"&gt;Lehrke, R.

=== Criticisms ===
Psychologist and psychometrician [[Steve Blinkhorn]] published a criticism in the journal ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' against [[Richard Lynn]] and [[Paul Irwing]] on their meta-analysis of sex differences, where he said they were flawed in excluding an intelligence study from Mexico that accounted for almost 45% of the data.&lt;ref name="Intelligence: A gender bender" /&gt; He said that had it not been excluded, no sex differences would have been found. He said there was a need for better research designs instead of summing up through meta-analysis.&lt;ref name="Intelligence: A gender bender" /&gt;

A 2008 study by Earl Hunt published in the journal ''[[Intelligence (journal)|Intelligence]]'' found that sex differences on tests can result from recruitment factors, so that gender differences are only representative of those that actually participate in the studies. He also contested that not only can there be individual variations that studies consistently recruit, but that these studies wouldn't be representative of the general population especially if the participants only represent college students.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Recruitment modeling: An analysis and an application to the study of male–female differences in intelligence|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160289608000251|journal = Intelligence|date = 2008-11-01|pages = 653–663|volume = 36|issue = 6|doi = 10.1016/j.intell.2008.03.002|first = Earl|last = Hunt|first2 = Tara|last2 = Madhyastha}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2009 study by researcher Dominika Dykiert published ''Intelligence'' also found that sex differences in mean IQ scores can be partly created by male variability in cognitive abilities and sample restriction.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Are apparent sex differences in mean IQ scores created in part by sample restriction and increased male variance?|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160289608000962|journal = Intelligence|date = 2009-01-01|pages = 42–47|volume = 37|issue = 1|doi = 10.1016/j.intell.2008.06.002|first = Dominika|last = Dykiert|first2 = Catharine R.|last2 = Gale|first3 = Ian J.|last3 = Deary}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dykiert highlighted the need for representative samples for studying sex differences in intelligence to eliminate skewed results created by male variance and restriction of sample.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Studies have also indicated that tests used to measure sex differences such as [[Raven's Progressive Matrices|Raven's Progressive matrices]] is not a pure indicator of general intelligence or ''g'' factor and only shares 50% of its variance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Raven's is not a pure measure of general intelligence: Implications for ''g'' factor theory and the brief measurement of g|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160289615001002|journal = Intelligence|date = 2015-09-01|pages = 71–79|volume = 52|doi = 10.1016/j.intell.2015.07.006|first = Gilles E.|last = Gignac}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tests like [[Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale|WAIS]] have also been criticized as not directly measuring ''g'' factor in a 2002 study published in ''Intelligence''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Education, Wechsler's Full Scale IQ, and g|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160289602001228|journal = Intelligence|date = 2002-09-01|pages = 449–462|volume = 30|issue = 5|doi = 10.1016/S0160-2896(02)00122-8|first = Roberto|last = Colom|first2 = Francisco J|last2 = Abad|first3 = Luis F|last3 = Garcı́a|first4 = Manuel|last4 = Juan-Espinosa}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lead researcher Roberto Colom has strongly asserted that ''g'' factor or general intelligence is the correlation among different test scores and not the summed scores on different tests, such as [[Raven's Progressive Matrices|Raven's]] or [[Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale|WAIS]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Education, Wechsler's Full Scale IQ, and g|url = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222654097_Education_Wechsler's_Full_Scale_IQ_and_g|website = ResearchGate|access-date = 2016-01-28|doi = 10.1016/S0160-2896(02)00122-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roberto Colom has also pointed out that Raven's Progressive matrices test is biased against females because of the visuospatial nature of the test which tends to favor those with stronger visuospatial skills (i.e. males) instead of ''g'' factor.

== Brain and intelligence ==
{{see also|Neuroscience of sex differences}}

Differences in brain physiology between sexes do not necessarily relate to differences in intellect. Haier et al. found in a 2004 study that "[m]en and women apparently achieve similar IQ results with different brain regions, suggesting that there is no singular underlying neuroanatomical structure to general intelligence and that different types of brain designs may manifest equivalent intellectual performance.&lt;ref name="Haier"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.neuroimage.2004.11.019 |title=The neuroanatomy of general intelligence: Sex matters |year=2005 |last1=Haier |first1=Richard J. |last2=Jung |first2=Rex E. |last3=Yeo |first3=Ronald A. |last4=Head |first4=Kevin |last5=Alkire |first5=Michael T. |journal=NeuroImage |volume=25 |pages=320–7 |pmid=15734366 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; For men, the gray matter volume in the [[frontal lobe|frontal]] and [[parietal lobe]]s correlates with IQ; for women, the gray matter volume in the frontal lobe and [[Broca's area]] (which is used in language processing) correlates with IQ.&lt;ref name="Cosgrave2007"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.biopsych.2007.03.001 |title=Evolving Knowledge of Sex Differences in Brain Structure, Function, and Chemistry |year=2007 |last1=Cosgrove |first1=Kelly P. |last2=Mazure |first2=Carolyn M. |last3=Staley |first3=Julie K. |journal=Biological Psychiatry |volume=62 |issue=8 |pages=847–55 |pmid=17544382 |pmc=2711771}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although men have bigger brain size which is partly explained by their bigger bodies, women have greater [[cortical thickness]], [[Cerebral cortex|cortical complexity]] and [[cortical surface area]] (controlling for body size) which compensates for smaller brain size.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Sex difference in the human brain, their underpinnings and implications|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=JFpq6hYQRhQC|publisher = Elsevier|date = 2010-12-03|isbn = 9780444536310|language = en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meta-analysis and studies have found that brain size explains 6–12% of variance among individual intelligence and cortical thickness explains 5%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Meta-analysis of associations between human brain volume and intelligence differences: How strong are they and what do they mean?|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S014976341500250X|journal = Neuroscience &amp; Biobehavioral Reviews|date = 2015-10-01|pages = 411–432|volume = 57|doi = 10.1016/j.neubiorev.2015.09.017|first = Jakob|last = Pietschnig|first2 = Lars|last2 = Penke|first3 = Jelte M.|last3 = Wicherts|first4 = Michael|last4 = Zeiler|first5 = Martin|last5 = Voracek|pmid=26449760}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Beyond a bigger brain: Multivariable structural brain imaging and intelligence|journal = Intelligence|date = 2015-01-01|issn = 0160-2896|pmc = 4518535|pmid = 26240470|pages = 47–56|volume = 51|doi = 10.1016/j.intell.2015.05.001|first = Stuart J.|last = Ritchie|first2 = Tom|last2 = Booth|first3 = Maria del C.|last3 = Valdés Hernández|first4 = Janie|last4 = Corley|first5 = Susana Muñoz|last5 = Maniega|first6 = Alan J.|last6 = Gow|first7 = Natalie A.|last7 = Royle|first8 = Alison|last8 = Pattie|first9 = Sherif|last9 = Karama}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, the [[National Science Foundation]] reported that, on average, girls perform as well as boys on standardized math tests, while boys are overrepresented on both ends of the spectrum.]]

A performance difference in mathematics on the [[SAT]] exists in favor of males, though differences in mathematics course performance measures favor females.&lt;ref name="Gallagher"&gt;Ann M.

In a 2008 study paid for by the [[National Science Foundation]] in the United States, researchers found that "girls perform as well as boys on standardized [[math]] tests.

Kiefer and Sekaquaptewa proposed that a source of some women's underperformance and lowered perseverance in mathematical fields is these women's underlying "implicit" sex-based stereotypes regarding mathematical ability and association, as well as their identification with their gender.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/01/070124104155.htm ''Implicit Stereotypes and Gender Identification May Affect Female Math Performance.''] Science Daily (Jan 24, 2007).&lt;/ref&gt; Some psychologists believe that many historical and current sex differences in mathematics performance may be related to boys' higher likelihood of receiving math encouragement than girls. Parents were, and sometimes still are, more likely to consider a son's mathematical achievement as being a natural skill while a daughter's mathematical achievement is more likely to be seen as something she studied hard for.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}} This difference in attitude may contribute to girls and women being discouraged from further involvement in mathematics-related subjects and careers.&lt;ref name="Wood, Samuel 2004"&gt;Wood, Samuel; Wood, Ellen; Boyd Denise (2004).

Participants in the gender salient condition were told, “males on average perform better on such tests.” Even though participants were given identical scores at the end of the task, women in the gender salient condition rated their ability on the task significantly lower than those in the gender-neutral condition, and even reported reduced interest in related occupations.&lt;ref name="autogenerated93"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Correll | first1 = S.J. | year = 2004 | title = Constraints into preferences: Gender, status, and emerging career aspirations | url = | journal = American Sociological Review | volume = 69 | issue = 1| pages = 93–113 | doi=10.1177/000312240406900106}}&lt;/ref&gt; While these two studies highlight the effect of stereotype threat on self-perception, another experiment by Rydell and colleagues found that stereotype threat can actually impair women’s ability to learn new gender-typed material. Women in the stereotype threat condition had difficulty encoding math-related information into memory and, therefore, learned fewer mathematical rules and showed poorer math performance than did controls. Stereotype threat reduced women’s, but not men’s, ability to learn abstract mathematical rules and to transfer these rules to a second, isomorphic task. The researchers concluded that negative stereotypes about women in math reduce their level of math learning, which then leads to poorer performance in negatively stereotyped domains.&lt;ref name="autogenerated883"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rydell | first1 = R.J. | last2 = Rydell | first2 = M.T. | last3 = Boucher | first3 = K.L. | year = 2010 | title = The effect of negative performance stereotypes on learning | url = | journal = Journal of Personality &amp; Social Psychology | volume = 99 | issue = 6| pages = 883–896 | doi=10.1037/a0021139}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two cross-country comparisons have found great variation in the gender differences regarding the degree of variance in mathematical ability. In most nations males have greater variance. In a few females have greater variance. Hyde and Mertz argue that boys and girls differ in the variance of their ability due to sociocultural factors.&lt;ref name="Hyde and Metz"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1073/pnas.0901265106 |title=Gender, culture, and mathematics performance |year=2009 |last1=Hyde |first1=J.

A number of studies have shown that women tend to rely more on visual information than men in a number of spatial tasks related to perceived orientation.&lt;ref&gt;Witkin, H. A., Lewis, H.

Results from studies conducted in the physical environment are not conclusive about sex differences, with various studies on the same task showing no differences.

The possibility of [[testosterone]] and other [[androgen]]s as a cause of sex differences in psychology has been a subject of study. Adult women who were exposed to unusually high levels of androgens in the [[womb]] due to [[congenital adrenal hyperplasia]] score significantly higher on tests of spatial ability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/0012-1649.22.2.191 |title=Early hormonal influences on cognitive functioning in congenital adrenal hyperplasia |year=1986 |last1=Resnick |first1=Susan M. |last2=Berenbaum |first2=Sheri A. |last3=Gottesman |first3=Irving I. |last4=Bouchard |first4=Thomas J. |journal=Developmental Psychology |volume=22 |issue=2 |pages=191–198}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many studies find positive correlations between [[testosterone]] levels in healthy males and measures of spatial ability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/0735-7044.108.2.325 |title=Testosterone influences spatial cognition in older men |year=1994 |last1=Janowsky |first1=Jeri S. |last2=Oviatt |first2=Shelia K. |last3=Orwoll |first3=Eric S. |journal=Behavioral Neuroscience |volume=108 |issue=2 |pages=325–32 |pmid=8037876}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the relationship is complex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0306-4530(91)90018-O |title=The relationship between testosterone levels and cognitive ability patterns |year=1991 |last1=Gouchie |first1=C |last2=Kimura |first2=D |journal=Psychoneuroendocrinology |volume=16 |issue=4 |pages=323–34 |pmid=1745699}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0079-6123(08)64456-8 |chapter=Performance and Intelligence in Hormonally Different Groups |title=Sex Differences in the Brain - the Relation Between Structure and Function |series=Progress in Brain Research |year=1984 |last1=Nyborg |first1=H. |isbn=978-0-444-80532-4 |volume=61 |pages=491–508 |pmid=6396713 |journal=Progress in Brain Research}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study was done to compare the relationship between mental rotation ability and gender difference, specifically in the SAT math section. Cognitive gender differences are apparent and findings of a male advantage in certain mathematical domains have been demonstrated cross-culturally. These gender differences found are largely in geometry and word problems and tend to be in countries with the highest-achieving students and with the largest gender gap in experience.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/0012-1649.31.4.697 |title=The influence of spatial ability on gender differences in mathematics college entrance test scores across diverse samples |year=1995 |last1=Casey |first1=M.

Moore and Smith say that within the United States, poorly educated female students outperform their male peers, but as the level of education increases, the male advantage in mathematics emerges.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Spatial ability may be responsible in part for facilitating gender differences in math aptitude. In 1995, Casey et al. looked at the relationship of mental rotation ability and the SAT-M among four samples. The four samples were: (1) undergraduates at two liberal arts colleges in the Northeast that were tested on their mental rotation ability in groups of 10–20; (2) a group of mathematically talented preteens participating in a summer math and science training in the Midwest, which included seventh to ninth graders who were either recruited from a national talent search program or statewide teacher selection program; (3) a high-ability group of college-bound students who were enrolled in a middle-income suburban high school in the Northeast and elected to take the SAT; and (4) a low-ability group of college-bound students who were enrolled in a middle-income suburban high school in the Northeast and elected to take the SAT. The data used were SAT math and verbal scores and mental rotation scores. Mental rotation was assessed using the Vandenberg Test of Mental Rotation.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Students were asked to match two out of four choices to a standard figure.

The study found that when mental rotation is used as a predictor of Math aptitude for female students, the correlations between mental rotation and SAT-Math scores ranged from 0.35 to 0.38 whereas males showed no consistent pattern. Male correlations ranged from −0.03 to 0.54.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; However, a finding was that in the three high ability samples, there was a significant gender difference in SAT-Math scores alone. This difference favored males. In the three high ability samples, males scored higher than females in mental rotation ability. For the verbal aptitude test on the SAT, there was a significant difference in verbal ability for the low ability college bound sample favoring girls.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

== Cognitive reflection test ==

The ability to apply analytical analysis (as opposed to making intuitive decisions, i.e. [[Thinking, Fast and Slow|System 1 and System 2]] thinking) is related to, but different from IQ.  On the [[cognitive reflection test]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://emilkirkegaard.dk/en/wp-content/uploads/Shane-Frederick-Cognitive-Re%EF%AC%82ection-and-Decision-Making.pdf|title = Cognitive Reflection Test and Decision Making|last = Frederick|first = Shane|date = 2005|journal = Journal of Economic Perspectives|volume = 19|number = 4|pages = 25–42|doi=10.1257/089533005775196732}}&lt;/ref&gt; which consists of "trick questions" where the intuitive answer is wrong, women scored on average 1.03, while men scored 1.47. Bosch-Domènecha and colleagues (2014) further found not only did men outscore women on the CRT, but that greater exposure to prenatal androgens (via a lower 2D:4D ratio) is significantly correlated with a higher score on the cognitive reflection test regardless of sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.psyneuen.2014.01.023 |title=Can exposure to prenatal sex hormones (2D:4D) predict cognitive reflection? |year=2014 |last1=Bosch-Domènecha |first1=A. |last2=Brañas-Garzab |first2=P. |last3=Espínc |first3=A.

== Sex differences in academics ==
A 2014 meta-analysis of sex differences in scholastic achievement published in the journal of ''[[Psychological Bulletin]]'' found females outperformed males in teacher-assigned school marks throughout elementary, junior/middle, high school and at both undergraduate and graduate [[university]] level.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = https://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/releases/bul-a0036620.pdf|title = Gender Differences in Scholastic Achievement: A Meta-Analysis|last = Voyeur|first = Daniel|date = 2014|journal = Psychological Bulletin|doi = 10.1037/a0036620|pmid = 24773502|access-date =|volume=140|pages=1174–1204}}&lt;/ref&gt; The meta-analysis, done by researchers Daniel Voyer and Susan D. Voyer from the [[University of New Brunswick]], drew from 97 years of 502 effect sizes and 369 samples stemming from the year 1914 to 2011. Another 2015 study by researchers Gijsbert Stoet and [[David C.

Geary|Geary]] concluded that sex differences in educational achievement are not reliably linked to [[gender equality]].&lt;ref name="Stoet 137–151"/&gt;

Beyond sex differences in academic ability, recent research has also been focusing on women’s underrepresentation in higher education, especially in the fields of natural science, technology, engineering and mathematics ([[Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics|STEM]]).&lt;ref&gt;S. J. Ceci, W. M. Williams, Why Aren’t More Women in Science? (APA Books, Washington, DC, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, 2011 data on earned doctorates in the United States by the [[National Science Foundation]] shows female representation in all of academia varies, not just in STEM subjects. For example, in 2011, women earned 54% of molecular biology PhDs but less than 20% in physics (STEM). In humanities and social sciences, women earned over 70% of psychology PhDs, but only 30% in philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;National Science Foundation, Survey of Earned Doctorates, (2011); [www.nsf.gov/statistics/srvydoctorates/]&lt;/ref&gt; A 2015 study published in the Journal of Women in Science explained these patterns of female under-representation across academic disciplines, using the ''field-specific ability beliefs hypothesis'', which claims that women are underrepresented in fields whose practitioners believe that raw, innate talent is the main requirement for success, because women are stereotyped as not possessing such talent. The study, conducted on 1820 academics from 30 different disciplines, found that the more a particular field values gifted-ness, the fewer the female PhDs in that discipline. According to the researchers, “emphasis on raw aptitude may activate negative stereotypes in women’s own minds, making them vulnerable to [[stereotype threat]]”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Leslie | first1 = S. | last2 = Cimpian | first2 = A. | last3 = Meyer | first3 = M. | last4 = Freeland | first4 = E. | year = 2015 | title = Expectations of brilliance underlie gender distributions across academic disciplines | url = | journal = Women in Science | volume = 347 | issue = 6219| pages = 262–265 | doi=10.1126/science.1261375}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Numerous studies have shown that gender stereotyping plays a big role in influencing women’s academic and career aspirations by reducing their interest in male-typed occupations like engineering, leadership and mathematics.&lt;ref name="autogenerated93"/&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated883"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Steele | first1 = J.R. | last2 = Ambady | first2 = N. | year = 2006 | title = Math is hard!"

Exposure to the stereotypic commercials resulted in women underperforming on a subsequent math test and avoiding math items in favor of verbal items. Furthermore, the women who viewed the stereotypic commercials expressed less interest in quantitative fields and more interest in verbal domains, both academically and professionally.&lt;ref name="Davies, P.G. 2002"/&gt;

== Self-fulfilling effects of scientific accounts of sex differences ==
Claims from scientific research on sex differences in intelligence, quite independently of their scientific validity, can have self-fulfilling effects and therefore sustain the very sex differences they seek to explain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fine | first1 = C | year = 2011 | title = Explaining, or Sustaining, the Status Quo? The Potentially Self-Fulfilling Effects of 'Hardwired' Accounts of Sex Differences | url = | journal = Neuroethics | volume = 5 | issue = 3| pages = 285–294 | doi=10.1007/s12152-011-9118-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Psychologist [[Barry Schwartz (psychologist)|Barry Schwartz]] extended the concept of ''idea technology'' to convey the point that the ideas and concepts produced by science and technology, just like the tangible products, can affect our lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schwartz | first1 = B | year = 1997 | title = Psychology, idea technology, and ideology | url = | journal = Psychological Science | volume = 8 | issue = 1| pages = 21–27 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-9280.1997.tb00539.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; This notion is also described as ''looping effects'' or ''feedback effects in cognition and culture'', whereby the causal understanding of a particular social group changes the very character of the group, leading to further change in the phenomenon under investigation.&lt;ref&gt;Hacking, I. (1996). The looping effects of human kinds. ''A Multidisciplinary Debate Causal Cognition'', 351–383&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Choudhury | first1 = S. | last2 = Nagel | first2 = S.K. | last3 = Slaby | first3 = J. | year = 2009 | title = Critical neuroscience: Linking neuroscience and society through critical practice | url = | journal = BioSocieties | volume = 4 | issue = | pages = 61–77 | doi=10.1017/s1745855209006437}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scientific claims about hardwired sex differences interact with people’s minds as they are communicated to the public in popular books and articles. ‘Brain facts’ have become increasingly popular and persuasive on public attitudes due to the increased fascination with [[neuroscience]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = McCabe | first1 = D.P. | last2 = Castel | first2 = A.D. | year = 2008 | title = Seeing is believing: The effect of brain images on judgments of scientific reasoning | url = | journal = Cognition | volume = 107 | issue = 1| pages = 343–352 | doi=10.1016/j.cognition.2007.07.017 | pmid=17803985}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Weisberg | first1 = D.S. | last2 = Keil | first2 = F.C. | last3 = Goodstein | first3 = J. | last4 = Rawson | first4 = E. | last5 = Gray | first5 = J.R. | year = 2008 | title = The seductive allure of neuroscience explanations | url = | journal = Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience | volume = 20 | issue = 3| pages = 470–477 | doi=10.1162/jocn.2008.20040 | pmid=18004955 | pmc=2778755}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Racine | first1 = E. | last2 = Waldman | first2 = S. | last3 = Rosenberg | first3 = J. | last4 = Illes | first4 = J. | year = 2010 | title = Contemporary neuroscience in the media | url = | journal = Social Science &amp; Medicine | volume = 71 | issue = 4| pages = 725–733 | doi=10.1016/j.socscimed.2010.05.017| pmc = 2925284 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Suggestions made in public domains that sex differences in achievement in science, mathematics or philosophy can be explained by innate brain differences can have important psychological effects. Haslam and colleagues found that emphasis on the biological causes of sex differences in intelligence suggests inevitability and fixedness, creating [[Scientific essentialism|essentialist]] beliefs about gender that deepen social divides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Haslam | first1 = N. | last2 = Rothschild | first2 = L. | last3 = Ernst | first3 = D. | year = 2000 | title = Essentialist beliefs about social categories | url = | journal = British Journal of Social Psychology | volume = 39 | issue = 1| pages = 113–127 | doi=10.1348/014466600164363}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Haslam | first1 = N | year = 2011 | title = Genetic essentialism, neuroessentialism, and stigma: Commentary on Dar-Nimrod and Heine (2011) | url = | journal = Psychological Bulletin | volume = 137 | issue = 5| pages = 819–82 | doi=10.1037/a0022386 | pmid=21859181}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research suggests that claims about psychological sex differences having biological causes underlie the negative effects of [[stereotype threat]]. Two studies in maths performance found that stereotype threat effects were only seen when it was explicitly claimed that the gender gap in performance was a result of [[Genetics|genetic factors]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dar-Nimrod | first1 = I. | last2 = Heine | first2 = S.J. | year = 2006 | title = Exposure to scientific theories affects women's math performance | url = | journal = Science | volume = 314 | issue = | page = 435 | doi=10.1126/science.1131100 | pmid=17053140}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Thoman | first1 = D.B. | last2 = White | first2 = P.H. | last3 = Yamawaki | first3 = N. | last4 = Koishi | first4 = H. | year = 2008 | title = Variations of gender-math stereotype content affect women's vulnerability to stereotype threat | url = | journal = Sex Roles | volume = 58 | issue = 9/10| pages = 702–712 | doi=10.1007/s11199-008-9390-x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, believing that males are hardwired to be better at math or any particular field reinforces the idea both that such abilities are "gifted" rather than earned, and that females need to work much harder because they do not possess this innate ability.&lt;ref&gt;Dweck, C. S. (n.d.). Is Math a Gift? Beliefs That Put Females at Risk. Why Aren't More Women in Science?: ''Top Researchers Debate the Evidence'', 47–55&lt;/ref&gt; An intervention study by [[Columbia University|Columbia]] and [[New York University|NYU]] psychologists challenged the ‘fixed’ view of intelligence and eliminated the gender gap in maths performance. Specifically, [[seventh grade]] students in the experimental conditions were encouraged either to view intelligence as malleable or to attribute academic difficulties to the novelty of [[middle school]]. Results showed that females in experimental conditions achieved significantly higher math standardized test scores than those in the control group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Good | first1 = C. | last2 = Aronson | first2 = J. | last3 = Inzlicht | first3 = M. | year = 2003 | title = Improving adolescents' standardized test performance: An intervention to reduce the effects of stereotype threat | url = | journal = Journal of Applied Developmental Psychology | volume = 24 | issue = 6| pages = 645–662 | doi=10.1016/j.appdev.2003.09.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beyond academia, the endorsement of biological explanations of sex differences in intelligence has been associated with greater modern day [[sexism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Keller | first1 = J | year = 2005 | title = In genes we trust: The biological component of psychological essentialism and its relationship to mechanisms of motivated social cognition | url = | journal = Journal of Personality &amp; Social Psychology | volume = 88 | issue = 4| pages = 686–702 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.88.4.686}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lamke | first1 = L. | last2 = Bem | first2 = S. L. | year = 1993 | title = The Lenses of Gender: Transforming the Debate on Sexual Inequality | url = | journal = Journal of Marriage and the Family | volume = 55 | issue = 4| page = 1052 | doi=10.2307/352790}}&lt;/ref&gt; In their research on the theorization of gender, Morton and colleagues found that people shown scientific claims that males and females are hardwired to be different, compared to those told that such ideas are under debate, expressed more agreement that society treats women fairly. Additionally, male participants became more supportive of [[Sexism|sex discrimination]] at work after reading the scientific facts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Morton | first1 = T.A. | last2 = Haslam | first2 = S.A. | last3 = Hornsey | first3 = M.J. | year = 2009 | title = Theorizing gender in the face of social change: Is there anything essential about essentialism? | url = | journal = Journal of Personality &amp; Social Psychology | volume = 96 | issue = 3| pages = 653–664 | doi=10.1037/a0012966}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other research indicates that shifting the focus from biological to environmental contributors of behavior can decrease endorsement of sexist hierarchies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dambrun | first1 = M. | last2 = Kamiejski | first2 = R. | last3 = Haddadi | first3 = N. | last4 = Duarte | first4 = S. | year = 2009 | title = Why does social dominance orientation decrease with university exposure to the social sciences?

As with any [[Scientific literature|scientific work]], claims about sex differences in the brain and their relation to behavior are subject to debate. Future research could be usefully targeted at exploring further the effects of believing in hardwired sex differences on society and how to reverse the negative consequences. Current research shows that believing in such claims increases gender bias in evaluations of others and backlash effects against females who violate gender norms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Eagly | first1 = A.

==Dyslexia==

[[Dyslexia]] is a learning disability that impairs a person’s fluency or comprehension accuracy in being able to read.&lt;ref name="National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke"&gt;{{cite web|title=Dyslexia Information Page|url=http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/dyslexia/dyslexia.htm|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160727234247/http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/dyslexia/dyslexia.htm|archivedate=2016-07-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The cause of this disability is associated with abnormal brain anatomy and function. Gray matter deficits have been demonstrated in dyslexics using structural magnetic resonance imaging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S1875-9572(10)60017-4 |title=Brain Imaging Findings in Dyslexia |year=2010 |last1=Sun |first1=Ying-Fang |last2=Lee |first2=Jeun-Shenn |last3=Kirby |first3=Ralph |journal=Pediatrics &amp; Neonatology |volume=51 |issue=2 |pages=89–96}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This deficit has been found in specific regions within the left hemisphere involved in language.

There is higher prevalence of dyslexia in males than in females.&lt;ref name="Evans et al 2013"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s00429-013-0552-4 |title=Sex-specific gray matter volume differences in females with developmental dyslexia |year=2013 |last1=Evans |first1=Tanya M. |last2=Flowers |first2=D. Lynn |last3=Napoliello |first3=Eileen M. |last4=Eden |first4=Guinevere F. |journal=Brain Structure and Function |volume=219 |pages=1041–1054|pmc=3775969 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, different abnormalities are found in female brains as opposed to male brains. In a study that examined gray matter volume in dyslexic females, it was found that there was less gray matter volume in the right precuneus and paracentral lobule/medial frontal gyrus.&lt;ref name="Evans et al 2013" /&gt;  In males, there was less gray matter volume in the left inferior parietal cortex.&lt;ref name="Evans et al 2013" /&gt;  This study shows that dyslexia in females does not involve the left hemisphere regions involved in language as it does in males. Instead, it affects the sensory and motor cortices such as the motor and premotor cortex and primary visual cortex.&lt;ref name="Evans et al 2013" /&gt;

{{Hinduism}}
'''Svéna''' ([[Sanskrit]]: स्वेन) is derived from the root "sva" (स्व), a reflective adjective, meaning self or one’s own or belonging to oneself; "éna" is a pronominal suffix meaning - "by" as in कालेन (kāléna) – 'by time' or 'by present time'.  "sva" +  "éna" = ''Svéna'' means – 'by your own' or 'by one’s own conditioned nature'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sanskrit Dictionary – Vedabase search|url= http://www.srimadbhagavatam.org/downloads/SanskritDictionary.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This word first appears in the [[Rig Veda]] in [[mantra]] (R.V.I.139.2) addressed to Mitravaruna –

: यद्ध त्यन्मित्रावरुणावृतादध्याददाथे अनृतं स्वेन मन्युना दक्षस्य स्वेन मन्युना |

in which mantra ''Svéna'' means - "own"; the phrase - ''anritam svena manyunā dakshasya'' means - "discard ''mithyā'' (falsity) by one’s own great fiery strength".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Rigveda with commentary by Swami Dayananda Saraswati|publisher=Arya Samaj, Jam Nagar|page=728|url=http://www.aryasamajjamnagar.org/rugveda/rugveda.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Hindu philosophy]], ''Svéna'' refers to the realization of one’s own true nature which is different from the notion of the body being the own Self.

[[Adi Shankara|Shankara]] in his commentary on the [[Chandogya Upanishad]] reminds us that only those who have renounced all desire for the external world and who have nothing else to fall back upon are able to comprehend the Supreme reality of the unity of the Self. The enlightened being recognizing his real nature as lying apart from the body renounces the notion of the body being his Self.

: एवमेवैष संप्रसादोऽस्माच्छरीरात्समुत्थाय परं ज्योतिरुपसंपद्य स्वेन रूपेणाभिनिष्पद्यते स उत्तमपुरुषः…

: " Thus indeed does this serene, happy being become manifest (or established) in its own real form (i.e. Self or nature) after having risen from this body and having reached the highest Light. That is the highest person;… " - (Chandogya Upanishad.VIII.xii.3)
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Chandogya Upanishad Part 2|pages=293, 294|url=https://archive.org/stream/ChandogyaUpanishadWithShankaraBhashya-EnglishTranslationPart2/04ChandogyaUpanishadWithSankaraBhashya-English-Part2#page/n299/mode/2up}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
[[Badarayana]] in the Sutra which reads

: संपद्याविर्भावः स्वेनशब्दात् |

: " Having reached the highest Light, the soul becomes manifest in its own real nature because of the use of the term in its own (in the Upanishad) ". – [[Brahma Sutras]] (IV.iv.1)

draws our attention to the afore-cited statement of the Chandogya Upanishad. Shankara in his Bhāśya explains that the Supreme Self, which is attributeless, can have no connection with time, space etc., and, therefore, cannot be a goal to be reached in terms of place or time. The person who has realized his own real nature becomes the fearless eternal seer of unity; for him intentions, works, sorrow and delusion cease to hold any meaning for these belong to the '' [[Anatman (Hinduism)|Anātman]] '', the body and the phenomenal world. The enlightened soul then attains liberation – मुक्तः प्रतिज्ञानात्, sheds all bonds, and established in Its own Self, the highest being, continues as the Pure Self untouched by likes and dislikes, as the immortal Light of all lights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Brahma Sutra Bhasya of Sankaracarya|author=Swami Gambhirananda|publisher=Advaita Ashrama|pages=895–897|asin=8175051051}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While advocating his concept of "''[[anatta]]''", [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] stating – "Of what is impermanent, sorrowful and liable to change, is it proper to regard it as – 'this is mine', 'this I am', 'this is my soul'?" - has followed a similar logic but without actually identifying the Self and leans towards the empirical finding of there being no evidence for its existence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Early Buddhist Theory of Knowledge|author=K.N.Jayatilleke|publisher=Routledge|pages=38–39|url=https://books.google.com/?id=6pBTAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA38&amp;dq=svena#v=onepage&amp;q=svena&amp;f=false|isbn=9781134542871|date=2013-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{InfoMaps}}
A '''topic map''' is a standard for the representation and interchange of knowledge, with an emphasis on the [[findability]] of information. Topic maps were originally developed in the late 1990s as a way to represent [[back-of-the-book index]] structures so that multiple indexes from different sources could be merged. However, the developers quickly realized that with a little additional generalization, they could create a [[Metamodeling|meta-model]] with potentially far wider application. The [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] standard is formally known as '''ISO/IEC 13250:2003'''.

A topic map represents information using
* ''topics'', representing any concept, from people, countries, and organizations to software modules, individual files, and events,
* ''associations'', representing [[hypergraph]] relationships between ''topics'', and
* ''occurrences'', representing information resources relevant to a particular ''topic''.

Topic maps are similar to [[concept map]]s and [[mind map]]s in many respects, though only topic maps are ISO standards. Topic maps are a form of [[semantic web]] technology similar to RDF.

==Ontology and merging==
Topics, associations, and occurrences can all be typed, where the types must be defined by the one or more creators of the topic map(s). The definitions of allowed types is known as the [[Ontology (computer science)|ontology]] of the topic map.

Topic maps explicitly support the concept of merging of identity between multiple topics or topic maps. Furthermore, because ontologies are topic maps themselves, they can also be merged thus allowing for the automated integration of information from diverse sources into a coherent new topic map. Features such as subject identifiers ([[Uniform Resource Identifier|URI]]s given to topics) and PSIs (''published subject indicators'') are used to control merging between differing taxonomies. Scoping on names provides a way to organise the various names given to a particular topic by different sources.

==Current standard==
The work standardizing topic maps (ISO/IEC 13250) took place under the umbrella of the [[ISO/IEC JTC1/SC34]]/WG3 committee (ISO/IEC Joint Technical Committee 1, Subcommittee 34, Working Group 3 – Document description and processing languages – Information Association).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://kikaku.itscj.ipsj.or.jp/sc34/ |title=JTC 1/SC 34 – Document Description and Processing Languages |author=ISO JTC1/SC34 |accessdate=2009-12-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140506050220/http://kikaku.itscj.ipsj.or.jp/sc34/ |archivedate=6 May 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://isotopicmaps.org |title=Home of SC34/WG3 – Information Association |date=3 June 2008 |accessdate=2009-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_technical_committee.html?commid=45374 | title=JTC 1/SC 34 – Document description and processing languages | author=ISO | publisher=ISO | accessdate=2009-12-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, WG3 was disbanded and maintenance of ISO/IEC 13250 was assigned to WG8.

'''The topic maps (ISO/IEC 13250) reference model and data model standards''' are defined independent of any specific serialization or syntax.
* [http://www.isotopicmaps.org/tmrm/ TMRM ] Topic Maps – Reference Model
* [http://www.isotopicmaps.org/sam/sam-model/ TMDM ] Topic Maps – Data Model

==Graphical notation==
[[Image:TopicMaps2Go.png|thumb|alt=Topic Map Martian Notation summary|Topic Maps Martian Notation (example)]]
There are different ways of notating topic maps graphically, in addition to GTM, listed below.  One recently developed example is '''Topic Maps Martian Notation'''.  '''TMMN''' (its acronym) is a simple graphical notation used to explain the Topic Maps data model, and map out both ontologies and representative instance data.&lt;ref&gt;https://dl.dropbox.com/u/10497886/TMMN/index.html Topic Maps Martian Notation tutorial&lt;/ref&gt;  It is designed for use on whiteboard or paper, as well as within any diagram-based software including everyday presentation tools such as [[PowerPoint]] and [[OpenOffice.org]]. '''TMMN''' uses only a very small number of symbols – "blob", "label", "line", "dotted line", and "arrow" – to represent the relationships and basic elements of the topic maps model: topics, names, associations (and roles), scope, and occurrences (including subject identifiers and subject locators).  The "Martian" refers to the archetypal "Martian Scientist",{{cn|date=January 2016}} namely, the ability to communicate knowledge across linguistic and cultural barriers, known and unknown. It was developed as part of the [[MusicDNA (database)|musicDNA]] project.&lt;ref&gt;http://beta.musicdna.info/about.aspx musicDNA&lt;/ref&gt;
'''Advanced Topic Maps Martian Notation''' is currently under development by the musicDNA community and includes shorthand notation for various types of whole-part relationships.
{{-}}

==Data format==
The specification is summarized in the abstract as follows: "This specification provides a model and grammar for representing the structure of information resources used to define topics, and the associations (relationships) between topics. Names, resources, and relationships are said to be characteristics of abstract subjects, which are called topics. Topics have their characteristics within scopes: i.e. the limited contexts within which the names and resources are regarded as their name, resource, and relationship characteristics. One or more interrelated documents employing this grammar is called a topic map."

===XML serialization formats===
* In 2000, Topic Maps was defined in an XML syntax XTM. This is now commonly known as "XTM 1.0" and is still in fairly common use.
* The ISO standards committee published an updated XML syntax in 2006, XTM 2.0 which is increasingly in use today.
''Note that XTM 1.0 predates and therefore is not compatible with the more recent versions of the (ISO/IEC 13250) standard.''

===Other formats===
Other proposed or standardized serialization formats include:
* [http://www.isotopicmaps.org/cxtm/ CXTM ] – '''C'''anonical '''X'''ML '''T'''opic '''M'''aps format (canonicalization of topic maps)
* [http://www.isotopicmaps.org/ctm/ CTM ] – a '''C'''ompact '''T'''opic '''M'''aps Notation (not based on XML)
* [http://www.isotopicmaps.org/gtm/ GTM ] – a '''G'''raphical '''T'''opic '''M'''aps Notation

The above standards are all recently proposed or defined as part of ISO/IEC 13250. As described below, there are also other, serialization formats such as LTM, AsTMa= that have not been put forward as standards.

Linear topic map notation (LTM) serves as a kind of shorthand for writing topic maps in plain text editors. This is useful for writing short personal topic maps or exchanging partial topic maps by email. The format can be converted to XTM.

There is another format called AsTMa which serves a similar purpose. When writing topic maps manually it is much more compact, but of course can be converted to XTM. Alternatively, it can be used directly with the [[Perl]] Module TM (which also supports LTM).

The data formats of XTM and LTM are similar to the W3C standards for RDF/XML or the older N3 notation.&lt;ref name=Garshol/&gt;

==Related standards==
===Topic Maps API===
A de facto [[Application programming interface|API]] standard called Common Topic Maps Application Programming Interface (TMAPI) was published in April 2004 and is supported by many Topic Maps implementations or vendors:
* [http://www.tmapi.org/ TMAPI] – Common Topic Maps Application Programming Interface
* [http://www.tmapi.org/2.0/ TMAPI 2.0] Topic Maps Application Programming Interface (v2.0)

===Query standard===
In normal use it is often desirable to have a way to arbitrarily query the data within a particular Topic Maps store. Many implementations provide a syntax by which this can be achieved (somewhat like 'SQL for Topic Maps') but the syntax tends to vary a lot between different implementations.  With this in mind, work has gone into defining a standardized syntax for querying topic maps:
* [http://www.isotopicmaps.org/tmql/ ISO 18048: TMQL] – Topic Maps Query Language

===Constraint standards===
It can also be desirable to define a set of constraints that can be used to guarantee or check the semantic validity of topic maps data for a particular domain. (Somewhat like [[database constraints]] for topic maps). Constraints can be used to define things like 'every document needs an author' or 'all managers must be human'. There are often implementation specific ways of achieving these goals, but work has gone into defining a standardized constraint language as follows:
* [http://www.isotopicmaps.org/tmcl/ ISO 19756: TMCL] – Topic Maps Constraint Language

TMCL is functionally similar to [[RDF Schema]] with [[Web Ontology Language]] (OWL).&lt;ref name=Garshol&gt;
{{cite web |url=http://www.ontopia.net/topicmaps/materials/tmrdf.html#N121 |title=Living With Topic Maps and RDF |author=Lars Marius Garshol |date=2003 |accessdate=2014-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Earlier standards===
The "Topic Maps" concept has existed for a long time. The HyTime standard was proposed as far back as 1992 (or earlier?). Earlier versions of ISO 13250 (than the current revision) also exist. More information about such standards can be found at the ISO Topic Maps site.

==RDF relationship==
Some work has been undertaken to provide interoperability between the W3C's [[Resource Description Framework|RDF]]/[[Web Ontology Language|OWL]]/[[SPARQL]] family of [[semantic web]] standards and the [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]]'s family of ''Topic Maps'' standards though the two have slightly different goals.

The semantic [[expressive power (computer science)|expressive power]] of Topic Maps is, in many ways, equivalent to that of [[Resource Description Framework|RDF]], but the major differences are that Topic Maps (i) provide a higher level of [[Semantic data model|semantic abstraction]] (providing a template of topics, associations and occurrences, while RDF only provides a template of two arguments linked by one relationship) and (hence) (ii) allow [[arity|''n''-ary]] relationships ([[hypergraph]]s) between any number of nodes, while RDF is limited to [[tuple|triplet]]s.

'''''Virtus''''' was a specific [[virtue]] in [[Ancient Rome]].  It carries connotations of valor, manliness, excellence, courage, character, and worth, perceived as masculine strengths (from [[Latin]] ''vir'', "man"). It was thus a frequently stated virtue of [[Roman emperors]], and was personified as a deity—[[Virtus (god)|Virtus]].

== Origins ==

The origins of the word ''virtus'' can be traced back to the Latin word ''vir'', "man".  The common list of attributes associated with ''virtus'' are typically perceived masculine strengths, which may indicate its derivation from ''vir''. From the early to the later days of the Roman Empire, there appears to have been a development in how the concept was understood. 

Originally ''virtus'' was used to describe specifically martial courage, but it eventually grew to be used to describe a range of Roman virtues. It was often divided into different qualities including ''prudentia'' ([[prudence]]), ''iustitia'' ([[justice (virtue)|justice]]), ''[[temperantia]]'' ([[temperance (virtue)|temperance]], self-control), and ''fortitudo'' ([[courage]]). This division of virtue as a whole into [[cardinal virtues]] is today classified as [[virtue ethics]], as described by [[Plato]]'s ''[[Republic]]'' and [[Aristotle]]'s ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]''. It implies a link between ''virtus'' and the Greek concept of ''[[arete (moral virtue)|arete]]''.

This inclusion leads to the belief that at one time ''virtus'' extended to cover a wide range of meanings that covered one general ethical ideal.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|McDonnell|2006|p=128}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The use of the word began to grow and shift to fit the new idea of what manliness meant.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|McDonnell|2006|p=141}}&lt;/ref&gt;
No longer did ''virtus'' mean that a person was a brave warrior but it could also mean that he was a good man, someone who did the right thing.  During the time of the decline of the Roman elite ''virtus'' the Roman upper class no longer thought of themselves as unmanly if they did not serve in the military.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|McDonnell|2006|p=257}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Virtue as described by Aristotle was rediscovered in the medieval age by [[Muslim]] philosopher [[Averroes]], which in turn influenced [[Thomas Aquinas]] to fuse virtue and ethics with Christianity in connection with the [[Renaissance of the 12th century]].

== In Roman political philosophy ==

''Virtus'' comes from the aristocratic tradition in which it is a specific type of public conduct. It is really only applicable in the ''[[cursus honorum]]'', certainly by the late republic at least. It is not a "private" virtue in the way that modern people might consider it. Valor, courage, and manliness are not things that can be pursued in the private sphere of the individual or the individual's private concerns. There could be no virtue in exploiting one's manliness in the pursuit of personal wealth, for example. ''Virtus'' is exercised in the pursuit of ''gloria'' for the benefit of the ''[[res publica]]'' resulting in the winning of eternal "memoria". According to D.C. Earl "Outside the service of the ''res publica'' there can be no ''magistratus'' and therefore, strictly speaking, no ''gloria'', no ''nobilitas'', no ''virtus''".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Earl|1966|p=27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the nobility ''virtus'' lies not only in one's personal "acta" but also that of one's ancestors. However Cicero, a ''[[novus homo]]'', asserted that ''virtus'' was a virtue particularly suited to the new man just as nobilitas was suited to the noble.  Cicero argued that just as young men from noble families won the favor of the people so too should the novus homo earn the favor of the people with his ''virtus''. He even extended the argument that ''virtus'' and not one’s family history should decide a man’s worthiness. ''Virtus'' is something that a man earns himself, not something that is given to him by his family, thus it is a better measure of a man’s ability.  Cicero's goal was not to impugn the noble class but widen it to include men who had earned their positions by merit.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Earl|1966|pp=47–49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term was used quite significantly by the historian [[Sallust]], a contemporary of Cicero. Sallust asserted that it did not rightfully belong to the ''nobilitas'' as a result of their family background but specifically to the ''[[novus homo]]'' through the exercise of ''ingenium'' (talent). For Sallust and Cicero alike, ''virtus'' is situated in the winning of glory by the execution of illustrious deeds (''egregia facinora'') and the observance of right conduct through ''bonae artes''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Earl|1966}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Who could have it ==

''Virtus'' was not universally applicable to just anyone – generally (although not always exclusively) only adult male Roman citizens would be thought of as possessing ''virtus''.

=== Women ===
''Virtus''  was rarely attributed to women, likely because of its association with ''vir''.  The highest regarded female virtue was ''pudicitia'': "modesty" or "chastity".  [[Cicero]], however, attributes this characteristic to females several times. He uses it once to describe Caecilia Metella when she helps a man who is being chased by assassins.{{refn|group=Note|There were several women called [[Caecilia Metella]]. Freese identifies her as the daughter of [[Quintus Caecilius Metellus Balearicus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |page=255 |author=Cicero |title=Pro Quinctio. Pro Roscio Amerino. Pro Roscio Comoedo. On the Agrarian Law. |others=Translated by J. H. Freese. Loeb Classical Library 240. |location=Cambridge, MA |publisher=[[Harvard University Press]] |year=1930}}&lt;/ref&gt; Balearicus had two daughters of that name. [[Caecilia Metella Balearica (priestess)|The elder]] was a [[Vestal Virgin]] and a priestess of [[Juno Sospita]]. [[Caecilia Metella Balearica|The younger]] was the wife of [[Appius Claudius Pulcher (consul 79 BC)|Appius Claudius Pulcher]].

Livy in Book 2 attributes it to Cloelia.

=== Children ===
''Virtus'' was not a term commonly used to describe children.  Since ''virtus'' was primarily attributed to a full grown man who had served in the military, children were not particularly suited to obtain this particular virtue.

=== Slaves ===
While a [[Slavery in ancient Rome|slave]] was able to be ''homo'' ("man") he was not considered a ''vir''. Slaves were often referred to as ''puer'' (Latin for ''boy'') to denote that they were not citizens.&lt;ref name="Myles McDonnell p.160"&gt;{{harvp|McDonnell|2006|p=160}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since a slave could not be a ''vir'' it follows that they would not be allowed to have the quality of ''virtus''. Once a slave was manumitted he was able to become a ''vir'' and he was also classified as a freedman but this did not allow him to have ''virtus''.  A good slave or freedman was said to have ''fides'', but no ''virtus''.&lt;ref name="Myles McDonnell p.160"/&gt;

=== Foreigners ===
[[Peregrinus (Roman)|Foreigners]] in the Roman world could be attributed with ''virtus'':  If they fought bravely they could be said to have ''virtus''.  ''Virtus'' could also be lost in battle.  ''Virtus'' could even be a cause to gain citizenship as in the case of Spanish cavalry men granted citizenship by Cn. Pompeius Strabo in 89 BC for their ''virtus'' in battle.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|McDonnell|2006|pp=160–161}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== How was it used ==
''Virtus'' applies exclusively to a man's behaviour in the public sphere, i.e. to the application of duty to the ''[[res publica]]'' in the ''[[cursus honorum]]''. His private business was no place to earn ''virtus'', even when it involved courage or feats of arms or other qualities associated to it if performed for the public good.

=== In private ===
While in many cultures around the world it is considered "manly" to father and provide for a family, family life was considered in the Roman world to be part of the private sphere.  During this time there was no place for ''virtus'' in the private sphere.  Most uses of ''virtus'' to describe any part of private life are ambiguous and often refer to another similar quality.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|McDonnell|2006|pp=168–172}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Roman world the oldest living patriarch of the family was called the ''[[pater familias]]'' and this title implied that he was able to make all legal and binding decisions for the family; he also owned all the money, land, and other property.  His wife, daughters, sons, and his sons’ families were all under his ''[[potestas]]''.  The only time a son was seen as separate from his father's control in the eyes of other Romans was when he assumed his public identity as a citizen. He could earn his ''virtus'' by serving in the military, and thus could only demonstrate manliness outside of the family setting. This is another reason that ''virtus'' is not often used to describe the Roman private life.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|McDonnell|2006|p=180}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In public ===
''Virtus'' was a crucial component for a political career. Its broad definition led to it being used to describe a number of qualities that the Roman people idealized in their leaders.

In everyday life a typical Roman, especially a young boy, would have been inculcated with the idea of ''virtus''.  Since military service was a part of most Roman men's life, military training would have started fairly early. Young boys would have learned how to wield weapons and military tactics starting at home with their fathers and older male relatives and later in school.  Also as a young boy one would have heard numerous stories about past heroes, battles, and wars.  Some of these stories would have surely told of the ''virtus'' of past heroes, and even family members.  Publicly it was easy to see the rewards of ''virtus''.  Public triumphs were held for victorious generals and rewards were given to brave fighters.  All of this propaganda would have encouraged young boys coming into their manhood to be brave fighters and earn the attribute of ''virtus''.  It was the duty of every generation of men to maintain the ''[[Dignitas (Roman concept)|dignitas]]'' which his family had already earned and enlarge it.  This pressure to live up to the standards of one’s ancestors was great.  In achieving ''virtus'' one could achieve ''[[Glory (religion)|gloria]]''.  By gaining ''virtus'' and ''gloria'' one could hope to aspire to high political office and great renown.

While young boys were encouraged to earn ''virtus'' there were also limits put on showing ''virtus'' in public.{{or|date=July 2012}} ''Virtus'' was often associated with being aggressive{{cn|date=July 2012}} and this could be very dangerous in the public sphere and the political world.  Displays of violent ''virtus'' were controlled through several methods.  Men seeking to hold political office typically had to follow the ''[[cursus honorum]]''.  Many political offices had an age minimum which ensured that the men filling the positions had the proper amount of experience in the military and in government.  This meant that even if a man proved himself capable of filling a position or was able to persuade people that he was capable, he would not necessarily be able to hold the position until he had reached a certain age. This also served to ensure that in elections of public offices no one had a certain advantage over another person because by the time most men went into public office they would have retired from military service. Furthermore, before any Roman soldier could partake in single combat he had to gain permission from his general. This procedure was meant to keep soldiers from putting themselves in extremely dangerous situations that they may or may not have been able to handle in order gain ''virtus''.

The concept of ''virtus'' also tended to be a concept of morality as far as politics were concerned.  This could range from the very literal definition of manliness seen in aggression and the ruthless acquisition of money, land, and power, or the lighter, more idealistic political meaning which almost took on the extended meaning of "pietas", a man who was morally upright and concerned with the matters of the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Earl|1967|pp=20–22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Plautus in ''[[Amphitruo]]'' contrasted ''virtus'' and ''ambitio''.  Virtus is seen as a positive attribute, though ''ambitio'' itself is not necessarily a negative attribute but is often associated with negative methods such as bribery.  [[Plautus]] said that just as great generals and armies win victory by ''virtus'', so should political candidates.  ''Ambitio'' “is the wrong method of reaching a good end.”  Part of ''virtus'', in the political sphere was to deal justly in every aspect of one’s life, especially in political and state matters.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Earl|1967|pp=32–34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Military ====

Although the two concepts are related, ''virtus'', for the Roman, did not necessarily emphasize the behavior that the associations of the present-day English term 'virtue' suggest. ''Virtus'' was to be found in the context of 'outstanding deeds' (''egregia facinora''), and brave deeds were the accomplishments which brought ''gloria'' ('a reputation'). This ''gloria'' was attached to two ideas: ''fama'' ('what people think of you') and ''dignitas'' ('one's standing in the community'). The struggle for ''virtus'' in Rome was above all a struggle for public office (''honos''), since it was through aspiring to high office, to which one was elected by the People, that a man could best show his manliness by means of military achievement which would in turn cultivate a reputation and votes. It was the duty of every aristocrat and would-be aristocrat to maintain the ''dignitas'' which his family had already achieved and to extend it to the greatest possible degree, through higher political office and military victories. This system resulted in a strong built-in impetus in Roman society to engage in military expansion and conquest at all times.

=== Sexuality ===
While in many cultures the virtue of manliness is also seen as being partly sexual, in the Roman world ''virtus'' apparently did not have sexual connotations.  Similar words deriving from the same stem often have sexual connotations.  In the Roman world ''virtus'' dealt with a great many areas such as martial courage, honor, and being morally upright rather than sexual manliness.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|McDonnell|2006|pp=165–167}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==

One of the most well known demonstrations of ''virtus'' was shown by [[Lucius Quinctius Cincinnatus]].  Before Cincinnatus was appointed dictator in 458 BC, Rome was in the midst of a battle with the [[Aequi]] and needed someone to take control. Messengers sent to fetch him found him plowing in his field.  Upon being informed of the appointment, he wept saying, "So my field will be unsown this year, and we shall be in danger of not having enough food to support us."&lt;ref&gt;Dionysius: ''Roman Antiquities'' 10.17.5&lt;/ref&gt;  Nevertheless, he dutifully gathered his things, kissed his wife goodbye and departed to raise an army and defeat the Aequi in a mere fifteen days. Upon returning home after the victory, Cincinnatus picked up the plough from where he left it and began plowing again.  [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]] recounts this story to illustrate the type of leaders the men of Rome were. He says that they “worked with their hands, led self-disciplined lives, did not complain about honorable poverty, and far from pursuing positions of royal power.”&lt;ref&gt;Dionysius: ''Roman Antiquities'' 10.17.6&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pompey]] is another prominent example of ''virtus''.  In 55 BC, Pompey inaugurated his grand theatre complex and dedicated several shrines to different gods, one of these being ''Virtus''.  This consecrated Pompey’s link with ''virtus''.  He gained a reputation with the public as being a man of ''virtus''.  Cicero, throughout his speech, the ''De imperio Cn. Pompei'', connects Pompey with ''"divina virtus"''.&lt;ref&gt;Cicero; ''De imperio Cn. Pompei''&lt;/ref&gt;  Pompey was so closely connected with ''virtus'' that once during a production of a play at the ''[[Ludi Apollinares]]'' one of the characters spoofed Pompey by stating ''"eandem virtutem istam veniet tempus cum graviter gemes"'': "The time will come when you bitterly resent that same ''virtus''".  The audience did not need to hear his name to know that Pompey was being referenced.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|McDonnell|2006|p=301}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marcellus and the Temple===
[[M. Claudius Marcellus]], during the battle of [[Clastidium]] in 222 BC, dedicated a temple to [[Honos]] and Virtus.  This was one of the first times that ''Virtus'' had been recognized as divine. The connection with ''Honos'' would have been obvious to most Romans as demonstrations of ''virtus'' led to election to public office and both were considered ''honos''.  The cult of ''Honos'' was already a long-standing tradition in Rome. The marriage of the two deities ensured that ''Virtus'' would also get proper respect from the Romans. But an objection by the pontiffs was that one temple could not properly house two gods because there would be no way of knowing which god to sacrifice to should a miracle happen in the temple.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

===Augustus===

During the reign of [[Augustus]], the [[Senate]] voted that a golden shield be inscribed with Augustus’ attributes and displayed in the [[Curia Iulia]], including ''virtus'', ''[[clementia]]'', ''[[iustitia]]'', and ''[[pietas]]''. These political catchwords continued to be used as propaganda by later emperors.

=== In literature ===

The comic poet Plautus made use of the concept of ''virtus'' in his play ''Trinummus'' which concerned family ''virtus'', honor and public office, and obligations to the state. He also offered commentary on the concept of ''virtus'' in ''Amphitruo'' (see above "Virtus and the Public").&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Earl|1967|pp=25–26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''wedding invitation''' is a letter asking the recipient to attend a [[wedding]]. It is typically written in formal, [[grammatical|third-person]] language and mailed five to eight weeks before the wedding date.

Like any other invitation, it is the privilege and duty of the host—historically, for younger brides in [[Western culture]], the mother of the bride, on behalf of the bride's family—to issue invitations, either by sending them herself or causing them to be sent, either by enlisting the help of relatives, friends, or her social [[secretary]] to select the guest list and address envelopes, or by hiring a service.  With computer technology, some are able to print directly on envelopes from a guest list using a [[mail merge]] with [[word processing]] and [[spreadsheet]] software.

==History==

===The Middle Ages and before===
Prior to the invention of the moveable-type [[printing press]] by [[Johannes Gutenberg]] in 1447, weddings in England were typically announced by means of a [[Town crier]]: a man who would walk through the streets announcing in a loud voice the news of the day. Traditionally, anyone within earshot became part of the celebration.

In the Middle Ages, illiteracy was widespread, so the practice of sending written wedding invitations emerged among the nobility. Families of means would commission monks, skilled in the art of [[Calligraphy]], to hand-craft their notices.

Such documents often carried the [[Coat of arms]], or personal crest, of the individual and were sealed with wax.

===From 1600 onward===
Despite the emergence of the printing press, the ordinary printing techniques of the time, in which ink was simply stamped onto the paper using lead type, produced too poor a result for stylish invitations. However, the tradition of announcing weddings in the newspaper did become established at this time.

In 1642, the invention of metal-plate engraving (or [[Mezzotint]]) by [[Ludwig von Siegen]] brought higher-quality wedding invitations within the reach of the emerging middle class.&lt;ref&gt;Griffiths, Antony (ed), ''Landmarks in Print Collecting - Connoisseurs and Donors at the British Museum since 1753'', p. 138, 1996, British Museum Press, {{ISBN|0714126098}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Engraving]], as the name implies, requires an artisan to "hand write" the text in reverse onto a metal plate using a carving tool, and the plate was then used to print the invitation. The resulting engraved invitations were protected from smudging by a sheet of tissue paper placed on top, which is a tradition that remains to this day.

At the time, the wording of wedding invitations was more elaborate than today; typically, the name of each guest was individually printed on the invitation.

===The Industrial Revolution===
Following the invention of [[Lithography]] by [[Alois Senefelder]] in 1798, it became possible to produce very sharp and distinctive inking without the need for engraving.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Lithography and Lithographers|publisher=T. Fisher Unwin Publisher|place=London|year=1915|editor=Pennel ER|url=https://archive.org/details/lithographylitho00penn}}&lt;/ref&gt; This paved the way for the emergence of a genuine mass-market in wedding invitations.

Wedding invitations were still delivered by hand and on horseback, however, due to the unreliability of the nascent postal system. A ‘double envelope’ was used to protect the invitation from damage en route to its recipient. This tradition remains today, despite advances in postal reliability.

===Modern times===
The origins of commercially printed 'fine wedding stationery' can be traced to the period immediately following World War II, where a combination of democracy and rapid industrial growth gave the common man the ability to mimic the life-styles and materialism of society's elite. About this time, prominent society figures, such as [[Amy Vanderbilt]] and [[Emily Post]], emerged to advise the ordinary man and woman on appropriate [[etiquette]].

Growth in the use of wedding stationery was also underpinned by the development of [[thermographic printing|thermography]]. Although it lacks the fineness and distinctiveness of engraving, thermography is a less expensive method of achieving raised type. This technique, often called poor man's engraving, produces shiny, raised lettering without impressing the surface of the paper (in the way traditional engraving does). As such, wedding invitations - either printed or engraved - finally became affordable for all.

More recently [[Letterpress printing]] has made a strong resurgence in popularity for wedding invitations. It has a certain boutique and [[craft]] appeal due to the deep impression or bite that can be achieved. It was not the original intent of letterpress to bite into the paper in this way, but rather to kiss it creating a flat print. The bite or deep impression is a recent aesthetic that adds the sensory experience of touch to letterpress printed wedding invitations. Many letterpress printers that specialize in wedding invitations are small start ups or artisan printers, rather than large printing companies.

Laser engraving has also been making headway in the wedding invitation market over the last few years.  Primarily used for engraving wood veneer invitations, it is also used to engrave acrylic, or to mark certain types of metal invitations.

The latest trend in wedding invitations is to order them online. Using the internet has made viewing, organising and ordering wedding invitations an easy task. There are hundreds of websites that offer wedding invitations and stationery and being online allows the customer to order from anywhere in the world.

==Text==
Etiquette regarding the text on a formal wedding invitation varies according to country, culture and language.  In Western countries, a formal invitation is typically written in formal, third-person language, saying that the [[Hospitality|host]]s wish for the recipient to attend the wedding and giving its date, time, and place. Even in countries like India, where the concept of wedding invitations was acquired through the British, the language continues to follow western traditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Bard Graduate Center|url = http://www.bgc.bard.edu/news/multimedia/academic/indian-wedding.html|website = www.bgc.bard.edu|accessdate = 2015-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the bride's parents are traditionally the hosts of the wedding, the text commonly begins with the names of the bride's parents as they use them in formal social contexts, e.g., "Mr. and Mrs. John A Smith" or "Dr. Mary Jones and Mr. John Smith". The exact wording varies, but a typical phrasing runs as follows:

[[Image:RedBumbleBeeInvitations.JPG|thumb|right|A modern wedding invitation]]
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;center&gt;
Mr. and Mrs. John A Smith&lt;br /&gt;
request the honour of your presence&lt;br /&gt;
at the wedding of their daughter&lt;br /&gt;
Jessica Marie&lt;br /&gt;
to&lt;br /&gt;
Mr. Michael Francis Miller&lt;br /&gt;
on the first of November &lt;br /&gt;
at twelve noon &lt;br /&gt;
Christchurch Hall&lt;br /&gt;
Richmond, Virginia&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Note the seemingly anglicised spelling 'honour'; this derives from a ruling laid down by [[Emily Post]] in the 1920s.

In the United States, the line "request...presence" is used when the ceremony is held in a house of worship; "pleasure of your company" is used when it is held elsewhere.

If the groom's parents are also hosts of the wedding, then their names may be added as well.  If the parents are not the hosts of the wedding, then the host's name is substituted in the first line, or, especially if the bride and groom are themselves the hosts, it may be written in the passive voice:  "The honour of your presence is requested at the wedding of..."

Formal announcements, sent after the wedding ceremony, omit the time and sometimes the place, but usually retain the same general form.

Informal invitations, appropriate to less formal weddings, are issued by word of mouth or by hand-written letter.  So long as they convey the necessary practical information about the time and place, there is no set form for these invitations.

==Printing and design==

Commercial wedding invitations are typically printed using one of the following methods: [[engraving]], [[lithography]], [[thermography]], [[letterpress printing]], sometimes blind [[Embossing (paper)|embossing]], compression plate process, or [[offset printing]].  More recently, many [[do-it-yourself]] brides are printing on their home computers using a [[laser printer]] or [[inkjet printer]].  For the artistically inclined, they can be handmade or written in [[calligraphy]].

Historically, wedding invitations were hand-written unless the length of the guest list made this impractical.&lt;ref name=Judith&gt;{{cite book
|author=Martin, Judith
|title=Miss Manners' Guide to Excruciatingly Correct Behavior
|publisher=W.W. Norton &amp; Co
|location=New York
|year=2005
|pages=390–391
|isbn=0-393-05874-3
|oclc= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  When mass-production was necessary, engraving was preferred over the only other widely available then option, which was a relatively poor quality of letterpress printing.  Hand-written invitations, in the hosts' own handwriting, are still considered most correct whenever feasible; these invitations follow the same formal third-person form as printed ones for formal weddings, and take the form of a personal letter for less formal weddings.&lt;ref name=Judith /&gt;

Tissues are often provided by manufacturers to place over the printed text.  Originally, the purpose of the tissue was to reduce smudging or blotting, especially on invitations poorly printed or hastily mailed before the ink was fully dried, but improved printing techniques mean they are now simply decorative.&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Post, ''Emily Post on Weddings'', page 65. 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;  Those who know that their original purpose has been made irrelevant by dramatic improvements in printing technology usually discard them.&lt;ref name="Martin1990"&gt;Martin, Judith. ''Miss Manners' Guide for the Turn-of-the-Millennium''. Simon and Schuster; 1990-11-15 [cited 17 September 2012]. {{ISBN|9780671722289}}. p. 662.&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern invitation design follows fashion trends.  Invitations are generally chosen to match the couple's personal preferences, the level of formality of the event, and any color scheme or planned theme.  For example, a casual beach wedding may have light, fresh colors and beach-related graphics. A formal church wedding may have more scripty [[typefaces]] and lots of ornamentation that matches the formal nature of the event. The design of the invitation is becoming less and less traditional and more reflective of the couple's personality. Some web-based print-on-demand companies now allow couples to design or customize their own wedding invitations.

The invitation is typically a note card, folded in half, or perhaps French folded (folded twice, into quarters).  Other options include a sheet of paper, a [[tri-fold]], or a trendy pocket-fold design.  The appropriate [[paper density]] depends on the design, but typically ranges from heavy paper to very stiff card stock.

==Mailing==
Traditionally, wedding invitations are mailed in double envelopes. The inner [[envelope]] may be lined, is not gummed, and fits into the outer envelope. The outer envelope is gummed for sealing and addressing.  More recently, the inner envelope is often left out in the interest of saving money, paper, and postage. In some cases, a pocketfold takes the place of an inner envelope.

In countries that issue them, the envelope may be [[franking|franked]] with [[love stamp]]s. The [[United States Postal Service|United States postal service]] issues a love stamp each year specifically denominated to cover the double weight of the invitation and reply (a rate slightly less than the cost of two regular stamps).

==Other items==

In addition to the invitation itself, sellers promote a full panoply of optional printed materials.  The ensemble may include an [[RSVP (invitations)|RSVP]] response card, a separate invitation to a [[wedding reception]], and information such as maps, directions, childcare options, and hotel accommodations.

Wedding invitations should be sent out 6–8 weeks prior to a wedding with slightly more time being given for out of town or destination weddings.  Guests should be asked to have their reply given between 3 and 2 weeks before the wedding date. Although many couples request RSVPs to be returned up to a month prior to the wedding day.

These printers also sell matching pieces intended for the day of the wedding, such as programs, menus, table cards, place cards as well as wedding favors and party favors such as napkins, coasters, cocktail stirrers and matchboxes.

==Response==
As with any invitation, the sole obligation of the person receiving it is to respond, as promptly as reasonably possible, to let the hosts know whether or not he will be able to attend.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
|author=Martin, Judith
|title=Miss Manners' guide for the turn-of-the-millennium
|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster
|location=New York
|year=1990
|page=436
|isbn=0-671-72228-X }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Receiving a wedding invitation does not obligate the recipient either to attend the wedding or to send a gift.

A proper response is written on the recipient's normal [[stationery]], following the form of the invitation.  For example, if the invitation uses formal, third-person language, then the recipient replies in formal, third-person language, saying either "Mr. Robert Jones accepts with pleasure the kind invitation to the wedding on the first of November", or "Ms. Susan Brown regrets that she is unable to attend the wedding on the first of November."

Pre-printed, pre-addressed, pre-stamped response cards are frequently sent in the hope of encouraging a greater proportion of invited people to respond to the invitation. Some American etiquette experts consider the practice incorrect and ineffective at increasing response rates.&lt;ref name="isbn0-393-06914-1"&gt;{{cite book

'''Widow chastity''' was an ideal in traditional Chinese cultural practices and beliefs that honored widowed women and discouraged their remarriage, encouraging them to instead live a life of "virtuous chastity".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Theiss, Janet. “Female Suicide, Subjectivity and the State in Eighteenth-Century China.” Gender History, vol. 16, no. 3, 2004, pp. 513–537., doi:10.1111/j.0953-5233.2004.00354.x.&lt;/ref&gt;  The cult is believed to have its origin among  [[Song dynasty]] [[Neo-Confucian]]s,&lt;ref name="hsiang"/&gt; and reached a culmination and eventual end {{citation needed|date=February 2018}} in the [[Qing dynasty|Qing era]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== History ==

===Song dynasty===
During the Song dynasty, [[Confucianism]] became the dominant belief system, and neo-Confucians such as [[Cheng Yi (philosopher)|Cheng Yi]] and [[Zhu Xi]] placed strong emphasis on chastity, with Cheng Yi believed to be responsible for the rise of the cult of widow chastity.&lt;ref name="hsiang"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yTvLQbaH81wC&amp;pg=PA133#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Confucianism and Women: A Philosophical Interpretation|authors= Li-Hsiang Lisa Rosenlee |publisher=State University of New York Press |pages=132–133 |year= 2007 |isbn=978-0791467503 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ebrey"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GDPskRXfl5cC&amp;pg=PA10&amp;lpg=PA10#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Women and the Family in Chinese History|author= Patricia Buckley Ebrey |pages=10&amp;ndash;12|publisher=Routledge |date=19 September 2002 |isbn= 978-0415288224}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Cheng Yi thought it improper for a man to marry a widow because "a marriage is a match and if one takes someone who has already lost her integrity, he would also lose his". On the question of widows who had become impoverished due to the death of their husbands, Cheng stated: "To starve to death is a small matter, but to lose one's chastity is a great matter."&lt;ref name="hsiang"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ebrey"/&gt;  While it was normal for widows to remarry in the early Song period, remarriage would become a social stigma in later eras due to the influence of Confucians, which led to hardship and loneliness for many widows.&lt;ref name=Adler&gt;{{cite web | last = Adler | first = Joseph A. | title = Daughter/Wife/Mother or Sage/Immortal/Bodhisattva?

===Ming dynasty===
During the [[Ming dynasty]], chaste widows were elevated to the role of cultural heroes.&lt;ref name=Adler/&gt;   Chaste widows were commemorated by the construction of chastity memorial [[Paifang|arches]] (貞節坊) and shrines, and honoured with commemorative writings.&lt;ref name="ropp"&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/09612029400200060 |title=Women in late imperial China: a review of recent english-language scholarship |journal=Women's History Review|volume= 3|issue=3|pages=347-383 |first=Paul S. |last=Ropp}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title= The Chaste and the Licentious: Female Sexuality and Moral Discourse in Ming and Early Qing China |first=Weijing |last=Lu|journal=Early Modern Women|volume= 5 |date=2010|pages =183-187}}&lt;/ref&gt; The state awarded 'testimonial of merit' (旌表, ''jingbiao'') to chaste women, giving approval of local chastity cults whereby commemorative arches and shrines were erected to honour the women by members of their families or communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url =https://books.google.com/books?id=svYcBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA18&amp;lpg=PA18#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title= Women and Gender in Twentieth-Century China |first= Paul J. |last=Bailey |page=18 |}}&lt;/ref&gt; Widow chastity became increasingly common, and chastity also became associated with suicide, with suicide by widows increasing dramatically during the Ming era.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YLCgu3XgOjMC&amp;pg=PR12#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false| last=T'ien|first= Ju-k'ang |date=1988|title= Male Anxiety and Female Chastity: a comparative study of Chinese ethical values in Ming-Ch'ing time |publisher= Brill |isbn=978-9004083615|pages=xii, 39&amp;ndash;69}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ropp"/&gt;

===Qing dynasty===
[[File:貞節牌坊（冰清玉潔） - panoramio.jpg|thumb|A chastity memorial arch]]
During the [[Qing Dynasty|Qing period]], the prevalence of child marriage along with a high rate of premature death among men left a substantial number of young women as widowers.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Rowe, William T. Chinas last empire: the great Qing. The Belknap Press of Harvard University Press, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Typically, a widowed woman would have been taken into her husband's familial household before his death and as a result would be unable to fulfill her intended purpose; birthing a male child to continue the husband's patriline.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; However, due to Qing-era China's higher proportion of men (mostly due to [[Female infanticide in China|female infanticide]]) a fertile woman, despite her previous marriage, could be sold and wed to another family for a substantial price.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 

The Qing court disapproved of this practice and instead regarded widow chastity as the epitome of [[filial piety]] and also as a statement of loyalty to the imperial court and the government officials.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Passionate_Women.html?id=OStF1E7pUf8C|title=Passionate Women: Female Suicide in Late Imperial China|last=Ropp|first=Paul Stanley|last2=Zamperini|first2=Paola|last3=Zurndorfer|first3=Harriet Thelma|date=2001|publisher=BRILL|isbn=9004120181|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; To promote this viewpoint the Qing court arranged to confer honors upon a family housing a chaste widow along with other measures such as the construction of a large and ornate ceremonial arch—"Chastity [[Paifang]]" or "Chastity and Filial Paifang" (節孝牌坊) —in the family's community.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Widows were also encouraged to adhere to chastity by way of legal impetuses, as according to Qing era law a widow could only inherit or act as a custodian of her husbands property if she preserved her sexuality as a statement of "loyalty" to her late husband.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In culturally dissident regions of the Chinese empire,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; government officials started "Widow Chastity" crusades to enforce orthodox Chinese culture and eliminate unconventional marriage customs, particularly the [[Levirate marriage|Levirate]], a practice in which a man marries his dead brother's widow in order to continue his patriline. &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Decline  ==
The "widow chastity" agenda began to receive controversy from the Qing court when elite families in central regions of China started using the imperial commendation of widow chastity to gain an edge in the social competition within their communities.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Authorities were particularly concerned with dubious cases in which honors had been given to families where the widow had committed suicide following her husband's death.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;Despite suicide being regarded as an honorable and virtuous course of action for a widow to take,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; the circumstances surrounding these suicides were  often very suspicious and suggested foul play on the part of the husband's family.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Eventually this issue led the imperial court to promote "Widow Chastity" with much less zeal and offer honors with more careful discretion.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;New cultural and intellectual developments in Qing China, in particular, the "Evidential Research Movement" ([[Kaozheng]]), also began to open up new conversations on the fundamental morality of "Widow Chastity".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Skeptics of neo-Confucian status quo of the time, notably [[Wang Zhong (Qing dynasty)|Wang Zhong]], condemned "Widow Chastity" as a collection of outdated rituals lacking in logic and basic human compassion.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}

'''''Wikinomics: How Mass Collaboration Changes Everything''''' ({{ISBN|1591841380}})&lt;ref&gt;{{LCCN|2006051390}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a book by [[Don Tapscott]] and [[Anthony D. Williams (author)|Anthony D. Williams]], first published in December 2006. It explores how some [[company (law)|companies]] in the early 21st century have used [[mass collaboration]] and [[open-source]] technology, such as [[wiki]]s, to be successful.

==Concepts==
According to Tapscott, Wikinomics is based on four ideas: Openness, Peering, Sharing, and Acting Globally. The use of mass collaboration in a business environment, in recent history, can be seen as an extension of the trend in business to [[Outsourcing|outsource]]: externalize formerly internal business functions to other business entities. The difference however is that instead of an organized business body brought into being specifically for a unique function, mass collaboration relies on free individual agents to come together and cooperate to improve a given operation or solve a problem. This kind of outsourcing is also referred to as [[crowdsourcing]], to reflect this difference. This can be incentivized by a reward system, though it is not required.

The book also discusses seven new models of mass collaboration, including:
* [[Peering]]: For example, page 24, "[[Marketocracy]] employs a form of peering in a mutual fund ({{mutual fund|MOFQX}}) that harnesses the collective intelligence of the investment community...Though not completely open source, it is an example of how meritocratic, peer-to-peer models are seeping into an industry where conventional wisdom favors the lone super-star stock advisor."&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=-WUhErZgmpoC&amp;pg=PA24 Wikinomics: How Mass Collaboration Changes Everything, 24.]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Ideagoras: For example, page 98, linking experts with unsolved research and development problems. The company [[InnoCentive]] is a consulting group that encapsulates the idea of ideagoras.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=-WUhErZgmpoC&amp;pg=PA24 Wikinomics: How Mass Collaboration Changes Everything, 97.]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Prosumer]]s: For example, page 125, where it discusses the social video game [[Second Life]] as being created by its customers. When customers are also the producers, you have the phenomenon: Prosumer.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=-WUhErZgmpoC&amp;pg=PA24 Wikinomics: How Mass Collaboration Changes Everything, 124.]&lt;/ref&gt;
* New Alexandrians: This idea is about the Internet and sharing knowledge.

The last chapter is written by viewers, and was opened for editing on February 5, 2007.

===Central Concepts of Wikinomics in the Enterprise===

According to Tapscott and Williams, these four principles are the central concepts of wikinomics in the enterprise:

# Openness, which includes not only open standards and content but also financial transparency and an open attitude towards external ideas and resources
# Peering, which replaces hierarchical models with a more collaborative forum. Tapscott and Williams cite the development of Linux as the "quintessential example of peering."
# Sharing, which is a less proprietary approach to (among other things) products, intellectual property, bandwidth, scientific knowledge
# Acting globally, which involves embracing globalization and ignoring "physical and geographical boundaries" at both the corporate and individual level.

===Coase's Law===

In the chapter ''The Perfect Storm'', the authors give an overview of the economic effects of the kind of transactions [[Web 2.0]] permits. According to the authors, [[Coase theorem|Coase's Law]] (see [[Ronald Coase]]) governs the expansion of a business:
&lt;blockquote&gt;A firm will tend to expand until the cost of organizing an extra transaction within the firm become equal to the costs of carrying out the same transaction on the open market.&lt;ref name='wikinomics56'&gt;Wikinomics: How Mass Collaboration Changes Everything, 56&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
However, because of the changing usage patterns of Internet technologies, the cost of transactions has dropped so significantly that the authors assert that the market is better described by an inversion of Coase's Law. That is:
&lt;blockquote&gt;A firm will tend to expand until the cost of carrying out an extra transaction on the open market become equal to the costs of organizing the same transaction within the firm.&lt;ref name='wikinomics56'/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; Thus, the authors think that with the costs of communicating dramatically dropping, firms who do not change their current structures will perish. Companies who utilize mass collaboration will dominate their respective markets.

==Reception==
A review of this book in the ''Harvard Business Review'' states "like its title, the book's prose can fall into breathless hype."&lt;ref&gt;Harvard Business Review, March 2007 v85 i3 p34(1)&lt;/ref&gt; A review of this book in ''Choice'' recommends the book for "general readers and practitioners," but cautions that the authors "present an optimistic overview of successful collaborations and business ventures", "use unique terms (e.g., [[marketocracy]], prosumption, [[knowledge commons]])", should have given "more consideration [to] the darker sides of human motivation as well as [[groupthink]] and mass mediocrity", and "primarily draw on their own observations of businesses and trends for the ideas presented".&lt;ref&gt;''Choice: Current Reviews for Academic Libraries,'' August 2007 v44 i12 p2147&lt;/ref&gt;

Tapscott and Williams released a followup to Wikinomics, titled ''Macrowikinomics: Rebooting Business and the World'', on September 28, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;http://dontapscott.com/books/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.macrowikinomics.com/&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:WPEVStartRunWires.png| thumb|upright| An automotive wiring diagram, showing useful information such as crimp connection locations and wire colors. These details may not be so easily found on a more schematic drawing.]]
A '''wiring diagram''' is a simplified conventional pictorial representation of an electrical circuit. It shows the components of the circuit as simplified shapes, and the power and signal connections between the devices. 

A wiring diagram usually gives information about the relative position and arrangement of devices and terminals on the devices, to help in building or servicing the device.  This is unlike a [[schematic diagram]], where the arrangement of the components' interconnections on the diagram usually does not correspond to the components' physical locations in the finished device. A pictorial diagram would show more detail of the physical appearance, whereas a wiring diagram uses a more symbolic notation to emphasize interconnections over physical appearance. 

A wiring diagram is often used to troubleshoot problems and to make sure that all the connections have been made and that everything is present. 

==Architectural wiring diagrams==
[[File:Ex-wiring-plan.svg|thumb|left|upright|Architectural style wiring diagram, with lamps and switches shown symbolically in their physical locations on the plan view of the building.]]'''Architectural wiring diagrams'''  show the approximate locations and interconnections of receptacles, lighting, and permanent electrical services in a building. Interconnecting wire routes may be shown approximately, where particular receptacles or fixtures must be on a common circuit. 
Wiring diagrams use standard symbols for wiring devices, usually different from those used on [[schematic diagram]]s. The electrical symbols not only show where something is to be installed, but also what type of device is being installed. For example, a surface ceiling light is shown by one symbol, a recessed ceiling light has a different symbol, and a surface fluorescent light has another symbol. Each type of switch has a different symbol and so do the various outlets. There are symbols that show the location of smoke detectors, the doorbell chime, and thermostat. On large projects symbols may be numbered to show, for example, the panel board and circuit to which the device connects, and also to identify which of several types of fixture are to be installed at that location. 

A set of wiring diagrams may be required by the electrical inspection authority to approve connection of the residence to the public electrical supply system. 

Wiring diagrams will also include panel schedules for [[circuit breaker]] panelboards, and riser diagrams for special services such as [[fire alarm]] or [[closed circuit television]] or other special services.
