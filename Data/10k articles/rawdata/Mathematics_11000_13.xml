'''125''' ('''one hundred [and] twenty-five''') is the [[natural number]] following [[124 (number)|124]] and preceding [[126 (number)|126]].

==In mathematics==
[[Image:5cube.svg|300px|top]]

125 is the [[cubic number|cube]] of [[5 (number)|5]].
It can be expressed as a sum of two squares in two different ways, 125 = 10² + 5² = 11² + 2².&lt;ref&gt;Wells, D. ''[[The Penguin Dictionary of Curious and Interesting Numbers]]'' London: Penguin Group. (1987): 136&lt;/ref&gt;

125 and 126 form a [[Ruth-Aaron pair]] under the second definition in which repeated [[prime factor]]s are counted as often as they occur.

Like many other powers of 5, it is a [[Friedman number]] in base 10 since 125 = 5&lt;sup&gt;1 + 2&lt;/sup&gt;.

      <comment>/* Adams operations in K-theory */ when the argument is a direct sum of line bundles, Adams operations produce vector bundles, not just elements of K-theory.</comment>
      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3517">In [[mathematics]], an '''Adams operation''', denoted ψ&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt; for natural numbers ''k'',  is a [[cohomology operation]] in [[topological K-theory]], or any allied operation in [[algebraic K-theory]] or other types of algebraic construction, defined on a pattern introduced by [[Frank Adams]]. The basic idea is to implement some fundamental identities in [[symmetric function]] theory, at the level of [[vector bundle]]s or other representing object in more abstract theories.

Adams operations can be defined more generally in any [[lambda ring|&amp;lambda;-ring]] over the rational numbers.

==Adams operations in K-theory==
Adams operations ψ&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt; on K theory (algebraic or topological) are characterized by the following properties.
# ψ&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt; are [[ring homomorphism]]s.
# ψ&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;(l)= l&lt;sup&gt;k&lt;/sup&gt; if l is the class of a [[line bundle]].
# ψ&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt; are [[functorial]].

The fundamental idea is that for a vector bundle ''V'' on a [[topological space]] ''X'', there is an analogy between Adams operators and [[exterior power]]s, in which

:ψ&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;(''V'') is to Λ&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;(''V'')

as

:the [[Power sum symmetric polynomial|power sum]] Σ α&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt; is to the ''k''-th [[elementary symmetric function]] σ&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;

of the roots α of a [[polynomial]] ''P''(''t''). (Cf. [[Newton's identities]].) Here Λ&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt; denotes the ''k''-th exterior power. From classical algebra it is known that the power sums are certain [[integral polynomial]]s ''Q''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; in the σ&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;. The idea is to apply the same polynomials to the Λ&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;(''V''), taking the place of σ&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;. This calculation can be defined in a ''K''-group, in which vector bundles may be formally combined by addition, subtraction and multiplication ([[tensor product]]). The polynomials here are called '''Newton polynomials''' (not, however, the [[Newton polynomial]]s of [[interpolation]] theory).

Justification of the expected properties comes from the line bundle case, where ''V'' is a [[Whitney sum]] of line bundles. In this special case the result of any Adams operation is naturally a vector bundle, not a linear combination of ones in ''K''-theory. Treating the line bundle direct factors formally as roots is something rather standard in [[algebraic topology]] (cf. the [[Leray–Hirsch theorem]]). In general a mechanism for reducing to that case comes from the [[splitting principle]] for vector bundles.

==Adams operations in group representation theory==
The Adams operation has a simple expression in [[group representation]] theory.&lt;ref name=Sn108&gt;{{cite book | title=Explicit Brauer Induction: With Applications to Algebra and Number Theory | volume=40 | series=Cambridge Studies in Advanced Mathematics | first=V.

The representation ψ&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;(ρ) has character

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17128">In [[mathematics]] and [[theoretical computer science]], an '''automatic sequence''' (also called a '''''k''-automatic sequence''' or a '''''k''-recognizable sequence''' when one wants to indicate that the base of the numerals used is ''k'') is an infinite [[sequence]] of terms characterized by a [[finite automaton]].  The ''n''-th term of an automatic sequence ''a''(''n'') is a mapping of the final state reached in a finite automaton accepting the digits of the number ''n'' in some fixed [[radix|base]]&amp;nbsp;''k''.&lt;ref name=as1&gt;Allouche &amp; Shallit (2003) p.&amp;nbsp;152&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BLRS78&gt;Berstel et al (2009) p.&amp;nbsp;78&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''automatic set''' is a set of non-negative integers ''S'' for which the sequence of values of its characteristic function χ&lt;sub&gt;''S''&lt;/sub&gt; is an automatic sequence; that is, ''S'' is ''k''-automatic if χ&lt;sub&gt;''S''&lt;/sub&gt;(''n'') is ''k''-automatic, where χ&lt;sub&gt;''S''&lt;/sub&gt;(''n'') = 1 if ''n''&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\in&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;''S'' and 0 otherwise.&lt;ref&gt;Allouche &amp; Shallit (2003) p.&amp;nbsp;168&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=PF13/&gt;

==Definition==

Automatic sequences may be defined in a number of ways, all of which are equivalent. Four common definitions are as follows.

===Automata-theoretic===
Let ''k'' be a positive [[integer]], and let ''D'' = (''Q'', Σ&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;, δ, ''q&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'', Δ, τ) be a [[deterministic finite automaton]] ''with output'', where
*''Q'' is the finite [[Set (mathematics)|set]] of states;
*the input alphabet Σ&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; consists of the set {0,1,...,''k''-1} of possible digits in [[radix|base]]-''k'' notation;
*δ : ''Q'' × Σ&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; → ''Q'' is the transition function;
*''q&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'' ∈ ''Q'' is the initial state;
*the output alphabet Δ is a finite set; and
*τ : ''Q'' → Δ is the output function mapping from the set of internal states to the output alphabet.

Extend the transition function δ from acting on single digits to acting on strings of digits by defining the action of δ on a string ''s'' consisting of digits ''s''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''s''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;...''s''&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt; as:

:δ(''q'',''s'') = δ(δ(''q&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''s''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''s''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;...''s''&lt;sub&gt;''t''-1&lt;/sub&gt;), ''s''&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt;).

Define a function ''a'' from the set of positive integers to the output alphabet Δ as follows:

:''a''(''n'') = τ(δ(''q&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'',''s''(''n''))),

where ''s''(''n'') is ''n'' written in base ''k''. Then the sequence ''a'' = ''a''(1)''a''(2)''a''(3)... is a ''k''-automatic sequence.&lt;ref name=as1/&gt;

An automaton reading the base ''k'' digits of ''s''(''n'') starting with the most significant digit is said to be ''direct reading'', while an automaton starting with the least significant digit is ''reverse reading''.&lt;ref name=PF13&gt;Pytheas Fogg (2002) p.&amp;nbsp;13&lt;/ref&gt; The above definition holds whether ''s''(''n'') is direct or reverse reading.&lt;ref name=PF15&gt;Pytheas Fogg (2002) p.&amp;nbsp;15&lt;/ref&gt;

===Substitution===
Let φ be a ''k''-[[uniform morphism]] of a [[free monoid]] Σ&lt;sup&gt;&amp;lowast;&lt;/sup&gt; and let τ be defined as in the automata-theoretic case. If ''w'' is a [[fixed point (mathematics)|fixed point]] of φ—that is, if ''w'' = φ(''w'')—then ''s'' = τ(''w'') is a ''k''-automatic sequence.&lt;ref name=AS175&gt;Allouche &amp; Shallit (2003) p.&amp;nbsp;175&lt;/ref&gt; This result is due to Cobham, and it is referred to in the literature as ''Cobham's theorem''.&lt;ref name=BLRS78/&gt;&lt;ref name=C72&gt;Cobham (1972)&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, every ''k''-automatic sequence is obtainable in this way.&lt;ref name=PF13/&gt;

===''k''-kernel===
Let ''k''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;2. The ''k-kernel'' of the sequence ''s''(''n'') is the set of subsequences
:&lt;math&gt;K_{k}(s) = \{s(k^e n + r) : e \geq 0 \text{ and } 0 \leq r \leq k^e - 1\}.&lt;/math&gt;
In most cases, the ''k''-kernel of a sequence is infinite. However, if the ''k''-kernel is finite, then the sequence ''s''(''n'') is ''k''-automatic.&lt;ref name=AS185&gt;Allouche &amp; Shallit (2003) p.&amp;nbsp;185&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ApCOw527&gt;Lothaire (2005) p.&amp;nbsp;527&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BR91&gt;Berstel &amp; Reutenauer (2011) p.&amp;nbsp;91&lt;/ref&gt;

It follows that a ''k''-automatic sequence is necessarily a sequence on a finite alphabet.

===Formal power series===
Let ''u''(''n'') be a sequence over an alphabet Σ and suppose that there is an [[injective function]] β from Σ to the [[finite field]] '''F'''&lt;sub&gt;''q''&lt;/sub&gt;, where ''q'' = ''p''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; for some prime ''p''.  The associated [[formal power series]] is 
:&lt;math&gt; \sum_{i \geq 0} \beta(u(i)) X^i . &lt;/math&gt; 
Then the sequence ''u'' is ''q''-automatic if and only if this formal power series is [[Algebraic function|algebraic]] over '''F'''&lt;sub&gt;''q''&lt;/sub&gt;(''X''). This result is due to Christol, and it is referred to in the literature as ''Christol's theorem''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first=G. | last=Christol | title=Ensembles presque périodiques ''k''-reconnaissables | journal=Theoret. Comput. Sci. | volume=9 | year=1979 | pages=141–145 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Automatic sequences were introduced by [[Julius Richard Büchi|Büchi]] in 1960,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first=J. R. | last=Büchi | title=Weak second-order arithmetic and finite automata | journal=Z. Math. Logik Grundlagen Math. | volume=6 | year=1960 | pages=66–92 | doi=10.1007/978-1-4613-8928-6_22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; although his paper took a more logico-theoretic approach to the matter and did not use the terminology found in this article. The notion of automatic sequences was further studied by Cobham in 1972, who called these sequences "uniform [[Tag system|tag sequences]]".&lt;ref name=C72/&gt;

The term "automatic sequence" first appeared in a paper of Deshouillers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first=J.-M. | last=Deshouillers | title=La répartition modulo 1 des puissances de rationnels dans l’anneau des séries formelles sur un corps fini | journal=Séminaire de Théorie des Nombres de Bordeaux | year=1979–1980 | pages=5.01–5.22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
The following sequences are automatic:

===Thue–Morse sequence===
[[File:ThueMorseAutomaton.png|thumb|DFAO generating the Thue–Morse sequence]]
The [[Thue–Morse sequence]] ''t''(''n'') ({{OEIS2C|id=A010060}}) is the [[fixed point (mathematics)|fixed point]] of the morphism 0 → 01, 1 → 10. Since the ''n''-th term of the Thue–Morse sequence counts the number of ones [[Modulo operation|modulo]] 2 in the base-2 representation of ''n'', it is generated by the two-state deterministic finite automaton with output pictured here, where being in state ''q''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; indicates there are an even number of ones in the representation of ''n'' and being in state ''q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; indicates there are an odd number of ones.
Hence, the Thue–Morse sequence is 2-automatic.

===Period-doubling sequence===
The ''n''-th term of the period-doubling sequence ''d''(''n'') ({{OEIS2C|id=A096268}}) is determined by the parity of the exponent of the highest power of 2 dividing ''n''. It is also the fixed point of the morphism 0 → 01, 1 → 00.&lt;ref name=AS176&gt;Allouche &amp; Shallit (2003) p.&amp;nbsp;176&lt;/ref&gt; Starting with the initial term ''w'' = 0 and iterating the 2-uniform morphism φ on ''w'' where φ(0) = 01 and φ(1) = 00, it is evident that the period-doubling sequence is the fixed-point of φ(''w'') and thus it is 2-automatic.

===Rudin–Shapiro sequence===
The ''n''-th term of the [[Rudin–Shapiro sequence]] ''r''(''n'') ({{OEIS2C|id=A020985}}) is determined by the number of consecutive ones in the base-2 representation of ''n''. The 2-kernel of the Rudin–Shapiro sequence&lt;ref name=AS154&gt;Allouche &amp; Shallit (2003) p.&amp;nbsp;186&lt;/ref&gt; is 
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
r(2n) &amp;= r(n), \\
r(4n+1) &amp;= r(n), \\
r(8n+7) &amp;= r(2n+1), \\
r(16n+3) &amp;= r(8n+3), \\
r(16n+11) &amp;= r(4n+3).
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
Since the 2-kernel consists only of ''r''(''n''), ''r''(2''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1), ''r''(4''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;3), and ''r''(8''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;3), it is finite and thus the Rudin–Shapiro sequence is 2-automatic.

===Other sequences===
Both the [[Baum–Sweet sequence]]&lt;ref name=AS156&gt;Allouche &amp; Shallit (2003) p.&amp;nbsp;156&lt;/ref&gt; ({{OEIS2C|id=A086747}}) and the [[regular paperfolding sequence]]&lt;ref name=BR92&gt;Berstel &amp; Reutenauer (2011) p.&amp;nbsp;92&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=AS155&gt;Allouche &amp; Shallit (2003) p.&amp;nbsp;155&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=LotIII526&gt;Lothaire (2005) p.&amp;nbsp;526&lt;/ref&gt; ({{OEIS2C|id=A014577}}) are automatic. In addition, the general paperfolding sequence with a periodic sequence of folds is also automatic.&lt;ref name=AS183&gt;Allouche &amp; Shallit (2003) p.&amp;nbsp;183&lt;/ref&gt;

==Properties==
Automatic sequences exhibit a number of interesting properties. A non-exhaustive list of these properties is presented below.

*Every automatic sequence is a [[morphic word]].&lt;ref name=LotIII524&gt;Lothaire (2005) p.&amp;nbsp;524&lt;/ref&gt;
*For ''k''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;2 and ''r''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;1, a sequence is ''k''-automatic if and only if it is ''k''&lt;sup&gt;''r''&lt;/sup&gt;-automatic.

*If ''u''(''n'') is a ''k''-automatic sequence over an alphabet Σ and ''f'' is a [[uniform morphism]] from Σ&lt;sup&gt;&amp;lowast;&lt;/sup&gt; to another alphabet Δ&lt;sup&gt;&amp;lowast;&lt;/sup&gt;, then ''f''(''u'') is a ''k''-automatic sequence over Δ.&lt;ref name=ApCoW532&gt;Lothaire (2005) p.&amp;nbsp;532&lt;/ref&gt;
*If ''u''(''n'') is a ''k''-automatic sequence, then the sequences ''u''(''k''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;) and ''u''(''k''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1) are ultimately periodic.&lt;ref name=ApCoW529&gt;Lothaire (2005) p.&amp;nbsp;529&lt;/ref&gt;  Conversely, if ''u''(''n'') is an ultimately periodic sequence, then the sequence ''v'' defined by ''v''(''k''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;) = ''u''(''n'') and otherwise zero is ''k''-automatic.&lt;ref name=BR103&gt;Berstel &amp; Reutenauer (2011) p.&amp;nbsp;103&lt;/ref&gt;

==1-automatic sequences==
''k''-automatic sequences are normally only defined for ''k''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;2.&lt;ref name=as1/&gt; The concept can be extended to ''k'' = 1 by defining a 1-automatic sequence to be a sequence whose ''n''-th term depends on the [[unary numeral system|unary notation]] for ''n''; that is, (1)&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;. Since a finite state automaton must eventually return to a previously visited state, all 1-automatic sequences are ultimately periodic.

==Generalizations==
Automatic sequences are robust against variations to either the definition or the input sequence. For instance, as noted in the automata-theoretic definition, a given sequence remains automatic under both direct and reverse reading of the input sequence. A sequence also remains automatic when an alternate set of digits is used or when the base is negated; that is, when the input sequence is represented in base −''k'' instead of in base ''k''.&lt;ref name=AS157&gt;Allouche &amp; Shallit (2003) p.&amp;nbsp;157&lt;/ref&gt; However, in contrast to using an alternate set of digits, a change of base may affect the automaticity of a sequence.

The domain of an automatic sequence can be extended from the natural numbers to the integers via ''two-sided'' automatic sequences. This stems from the fact that, given ''k''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;2, every integer can be represented uniquely in the form &lt;math&gt; \sum_{0 \leq i \leq r} a_{i}(-k)^{i} , &lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;a_{i} \in \{0, \dots, k-1\}&lt;/math&gt;. Then a two-sided infinite sequence ''a''(''n'')&lt;sub&gt;''n''&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\in \mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; is (−''k'')-automatic if and only if its subsequences ''a''(''n'')&lt;sub&gt;n ≥ 0&lt;/sub&gt; and ''a''(−''n'')&lt;sub&gt;n ≥ 0&lt;/sub&gt; are ''k''-automatic.&lt;ref name=AS162&gt;Allouche &amp; Shallit (2003) p.&amp;nbsp;162&lt;/ref&gt;

The alphabet of a ''k''-automatic sequence can be extended from finite size to infinite size via [[k-regular sequence|''k''-regular sequences]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last1 = Allouche | first1 = J.-P. | last2 = Shallit | first2 = J. | title = The ring of ''k''-regular sequences | journal = Theoret.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="820">In mathematics, especially [[several complex variables]], the '''Behnke–Stein theorem'''&lt;!--, named after [[?????? Behnke]] and [[?????? Stein]], --&gt; states that a union of an increasing sequence &lt;math&gt;G_k&lt;/math&gt; (i.e., &lt;math&gt;G_k \subset G_{k + 1}&lt;/math&gt;) of [[domain of holomorphy|domains of holomorphy]] is again a domain of holomorphy.

This is related to the fact that an increasing union of [[pseudoconvex domain]]s is pseudoconvex and so it can be proven using that fact and the solution of the [[Levi problem]]. Though historically this theorem was in fact used to solve the Levi problem.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9498">In [[complex analysis]], [[functional analysis]] and [[operator theory]], a '''Bergman space''' is a [[function space]] of [[holomorphic function]]s in a [[Domain (mathematical analysis)|domain]] ''D'' of the [[complex plane]] that are sufficiently well-behaved at the boundary that they are absolutely [[integrable]]. Specifically, for {{math|0 &lt; ''p'' &lt; &amp;infin;}}, the Bergman space {{math|''A''&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt;(''D'')}} is the space of all holomorphic functions &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; in ''D'' for which the [[Norm mathematics|p-norm]] is finite:

:&lt;math&gt;\|f\|_{A^p(D)} := \left(\int_D |f(x+iy)|^p\,dx\,dy\right)^{1/p} &lt; \infty.&lt;/math&gt;

The quantity &lt;math&gt;\|f\|_{A^p(D)}&lt;/math&gt; is called the ''norm'' of the function {{math|''f''}}; it is a true [[Norm (mathematics)|norm]] if &lt;math&gt;p \geq 1&lt;/math&gt;. Thus {{math|''A''&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt;(''D'')}} is the subspace of holomorphic functions that are in the space [[Lp space|L&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt;(''D'')]]. The Bergman spaces are [[Banach space]]s, which is a consequence of the estimate, valid on [[compact space|compact]] subsets ''K'' of ''D'':
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\sup_{z\in K} |f(z)| \le C_K\|f\|_{L^p(D)}.&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|1}}}}
Thus convergence of a sequence of holomorphic functions in {{math|''L''&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt;(''D'')}} implies also [[compact convergence]], and so the limit function is also holomorphic.

If {{math|''p'' {{=}} 2}}, then {{math|''A''&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt;(''D'')}} is a [[reproducing kernel Hilbert space]], whose kernel is given by the [[Bergman kernel]].

==Special cases and generalisations==

If the domain {{math|''D''}} is [[Bounded set (topological vector space)|bounded]], then the norm is often given by

:&lt;math&gt;\|f\|_{A^p(D)} := \left(\int_D |f(z)|^p\,dA\right)^{1/p} \; \; \; \; \; (f \in A^p(D)),&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is a normalised [[Lebesgue measure]] of the complex plane, i.e. {{math|''dA'' {{=}} ''dz''/Area(''D'')}}. Alternatively {{math|''dA'' {{=}} ''dz''/''&amp;pi;''}} is used, regardless of the area of {{math|''D''}}.
The Bergman space is usually defined on the open [[unit disk]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{D}&lt;/math&gt; of the complex plane, in which case &lt;math&gt;A^p(\mathbb{C}):=A^p&lt;/math&gt;. In the Hilbert space case, given &lt;math&gt;f(z)= \sum_{n=0}^\infty a_n z^n \in A^2&lt;/math&gt;, we have

:&lt;math&gt;\|f\|^2_{A^2} := \frac{1}{\pi} \int_\mathbb{D} |f(z)|^2 \, dz = \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{|a_n|^2}{n+1},&lt;/math&gt;

that is, {{math|''A''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} is isometrically isomorphic to the weighted [[Sequence space#.E2.84.93p spaces|''ℓ&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt;(1/(n+1))'' space]].&lt;ref name="Duren"/&gt; In particular the [[polynomial]]s are [[dense subset|dense]] in {{math|''A''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}. Similarly, if {{math|''D'' {{=}} ℂ&lt;sub&gt;+&lt;/sub&gt;}}, the right (or the upper) complex half-plane, then

:&lt;math&gt;\|F\|^2_{A^2(\mathbb{C}_+)} := \frac{1}{\pi} \int_{\mathbb{C}_+} |F(z)|^2 \, dz = \int_0^\infty |f(t)|^2\frac{dt}{t},&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;F(z)= \int_0^\infty f(t)e^{-tz} \, dt&lt;/math&gt;, that is, {{math|''A''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;(ℂ&lt;sub&gt;+&lt;/sub&gt;)}} is isometrically isomorphic to the weighted [[Lp space|''L&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1/t&lt;/sub&gt; (0,∞)'' space]] (via the [[Laplace transform]]).&lt;ref name="Duren1969"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jacob"/&gt;

The weighted Bergman space {{math|''A''&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt;(''D'')}} is defined in an analogous way,&lt;ref name="Duren"/&gt; i.e.

:&lt;math&gt;\|f\|_{A^p_w (D)} := \left( \int_D |f(x+iy)|^2 \, w(x+iy) \, dx \, dy \right)^{1/p}, &lt;/math&gt;

provided that {{math|''w'' : ''D'' &amp;rarr; [0, &amp;infin;)}} is chosen in such way, that &lt;math&gt;A^p_w(D)&lt;/math&gt; is a [[Banach space]] (or a [[Hilbert space]], if {{math|''p'' {{=}} 2}}). In case where &lt;math&gt; D= \mathbb{D}&lt;/math&gt;, by a weighted Bergman space &lt;math&gt;A^p_\alpha&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name="Cowen"/&gt; we mean the space of all analytic functions {{math|''f''}} such that

:&lt;math&gt; \|f\|_{A^p_\alpha} := \left( \frac{1}{\pi}\int_\mathbb{D} |f(z)|^p \, (1-|z|^p)^\alpha dz \right)^{1/p} &lt; \infty, &lt;/math&gt;

and similarly on the right half-plane (i.e. &lt;math&gt;A^p_\alpha(\mathbb{C}_+)&lt;/math&gt;) we have&lt;ref name="Elliott"/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \|f\|_{A^p_\alpha(\mathbb{C}_+)} := \left( \frac{1}{\pi}\int_{\mathbb{C}_+} |f(x+iy)|^p x^\alpha \, dx \, dy \right)^{1/p}, &lt;/math&gt;

and this space is isometrically isomorphic, via the Laplace transform, to the space &lt;math&gt;L^2(\mathbb{R}_+, \, d\mu_\alpha)&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;ref name="Duren2007"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gallardo"/&gt; where

:&lt;math&gt;d\mu_\alpha := \frac{\Gamma(\alpha+1)}{2^\alpha t^{\alpha+1}} \, dt&lt;/math&gt;

(here {{math|''&amp;Gamma;''}} denotes the [[Gamma function]]).

Further generalisations are sometimes considered, for example &lt;math&gt;A^2_\nu&lt;/math&gt; denotes a weighted Bergman space (often called a Zen space&lt;ref name="Jacob"/&gt;) with respect to a translation-invariant positive regular [[Borel measure]] &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt; on the closed right complex half-plane &lt;math&gt;\overline{\mathbb{C}_+}&lt;/math&gt;, that is

:&lt;math&gt;A^p_\nu := \left\{ f : \mathbb{C}_+ \longrightarrow \mathbb{C} \; \text{analytic} \; : \; \|f\|_{A^p_\nu} := \left( \sup_{\epsilon&gt;0} \int_{\overline{\mathbb{C}_+}} |f(z+\epsilon)|^p \, d\nu(z) \right)^{1/p} &lt; \infty \right\}. &lt;/math&gt;

==Reproducing kernels==

The reproducing kernel &lt;math&gt;k_z^{A^2}&lt;/math&gt; of {{math|''A''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} at point &lt;math&gt;z \in \mathbb{D}&lt;/math&gt; is given by&lt;ref name="Duren"/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; k_z^{A^2}(\zeta)=\frac{1}{(1-\overline{z}\zeta)^2} \; \; \; \; \; (\zeta \in \mathbb{D}),&lt;/math&gt;

and similarly for &lt;math&gt;A^2(\mathbb{C}_+)&lt;/math&gt; we have&lt;ref name="Elliott"/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; k_z^{A^2(\mathbb{C}_+)}(\zeta)=\frac{1}{(\overline{z}+\zeta)^2} \; \; \; \; \; (\zeta \in \mathbb{C}_+),&lt;/math&gt;.

In general, if &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; maps a domain &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; conformally onto a domain &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt;, then&lt;ref name="Duren"/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;k^{A^2(\Omega)}_z (\zeta) = k^{\mathcal{A}^2(D)}_{\varphi(z)}(\varphi(\zeta)) \, \overline{\varphi'(z)}\varphi'(\zeta) \; \; \; \; \; (z, \zeta \in \Omega).&lt;/math&gt;

In weighted case we have&lt;ref name="Cowen"/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;k_z^{A^2_\alpha} (\zeta) = \frac{\alpha+1}{(1-\overline{z}\zeta)^{\alpha+2}} \; \; \; \; \; (z, \zeta \in \mathbb{D}),&lt;/math&gt;

and&lt;ref name="Elliott"/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;k_z^{A^2_\alpha(\mathbb{C}_+)} (\zeta) = \frac{2^\alpha(\alpha+1)}{(\overline{z}+\zeta)^{\alpha+2}} \; \; \; \; \; (z, \zeta \in \mathbb{C}_+).&lt;/math&gt;

'''Bit manipulation''' is the act of [[algorithm]]ically manipulating [[bit]]s or other pieces of [[Data (computing)|data]] shorter than a [[Word (data type)|word]]. [[Computer programming]] tasks that require bit manipulation include low-level device control, [[error detection]] and [[error correction|correction]] algorithms, [[data compression]], [[encryption]] algorithms, and [[Optimization (computer science)|optimization]]. For most other tasks, modern [[programming language]]s allow the [[programmer]] to work directly with [[Abstraction (computer science)|abstractions]] instead of bits that represent those abstractions. [[Source code]] that does bit manipulation makes use of the [[bitwise operation]]s: AND, OR, XOR, NOT, and [[bitwise operation#Bit shifts|bit shifts]].

Bit manipulation, in some cases, can obviate or reduce the need to loop over a data structure and can give many-fold speed ups, as bit manipulations are processed in parallel, but the code can become more difficult to write and maintain.

== Terminology ==

''Bit twiddling'' and ''bit bashing'' are often used interchangeably with bit manipulation, but sometimes exclusively refer to clever or non-obvious ways or uses of bit manipulation, or tedious or challenging [[low-level device control]] data manipulation tasks.

The term ''bit twiddling'' dates from [[History of computing hardware|early computing hardware]], where computer operators would make adjustments by tweaking or ''twiddling'' computer controls. As computer programming languages evolved, programmers adopted the term to mean any handling of data that involved bit-level [[computation]].

== Bitwise operation ==
{{main|bitwise operation}}
A bitwise operation operates on one or more [[bit pattern]]s or [[Binary numeral system|binary numerals]] at the level of their individual [[bit]]s. It is a fast, primitive action directly supported by the [[central processing unit]] (CPU), and is used to manipulate values for comparisons and calculations.
On simple low-cost processors, typically, bitwise operations are substantially faster than division, several times faster than multiplication, and sometimes significantly faster than addition. While modern processors usually perform addition and multiplication just as fast as bitwise operations due to their longer [[instruction pipeline]]s and other [[Computer architecture|architectural]] design choices, bitwise operations do commonly use less power because of the reduced use of resources.

== Masks ==
{{main|mask (computing)}}
A mask is data that is used for [[bitwise operation]]s, particularly in a [[bit field]].

Using a mask, multiple bits in a [[Byte]], [[nibble]], [[Word (computer architecture)|word]] (etc.) can be set either on, off or inverted from on to off (or vice versa) in a single bitwise operation.

== Example of bit manipulation ==

The following two code samples, written in the programming language [[C++]], both determine if the given unsigned integer '''x''' is a [[power of two]].
&lt;source lang="cpp"&gt;
 // The obvious method
 unsigned int x = ...;
 bool isPowerOfTwo;
 if (x &gt; 0) {
     /* Divide by two as long as the next division is an integer,
     and if it isn't, check if the number is 1 (meaning the number is
     some power of two) */
     while ((x % 2) == 0) {
         x = x / 2;
     }
     isPowerOfTwo = (x==1);
 }
 else { // zero is never a power of two
     isPowerOfTwo = false;
 }
&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;source lang="cpp"&gt;
 // A method using bit manipulation
 bool isPowerOfTwo = x &amp;&amp; !(x &amp; (x - 1));
&lt;/source&gt;

The second method uses the fact that powers of two have one and only one bit set in their binary representation:
 x         == 0...0&lt;span style="color:red"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;0...0
 x-1       == 0...001...1
 x &amp; (x-1) == 0...000...0

If the number is neither zero nor a power of two, it will have '1' in more than one place:
 x         == 0...&lt;span style="color:red"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;...0&lt;span style="color:red"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;0...0
 x-1       == 0...&lt;span style="color:red"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;...001...1
 x &amp; (x-1) == 0...&lt;span style="color:red"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;...000...0

If inline [[assembly language]] code is used, then an instruction that counts the number of 1's or 0's might be available; for example, the POPCNT instruction from the x86 [[instruction set]]. Some compilers provide predefined function for that, e.g. [[GNU Compiler Collection]] has __builtin_popcount(). Such instructions may have greater latency, however, than the bit-twiddling solution.

== Bit manipulation in the C programming language ==

The programming language [[C (programming language)|C]] has direct support for bitwise operations that can be used for bit manipulation. In the following examples, &lt;code&gt;n&lt;/code&gt; is the index of the bit to be manipulated within the variable &lt;code&gt;bit_fld&lt;/code&gt;, which is an &lt;code&gt;unsigned char&lt;/code&gt; being used as a [[bit field]]. Bit indexing begins at 0, not 1. Bit 0 is the least significant bit.

;Set a bit:
&lt;source lang="c"&gt;
bit_fld |= (1 &lt;&lt; n)
&lt;/source&gt;

;Clear a bit:
&lt;source lang="c"&gt;
bit_fld &amp;= ~(1 &lt;&lt; n)
&lt;/source&gt;

;Toggle a bit:
&lt;source lang="c"&gt;
bit_fld ^= (1 &lt;&lt; n)
&lt;/source&gt;

;Test a bit:
&lt;source lang="c"&gt;
bit_fld &amp; (1 &lt;&lt; n)
&lt;/source&gt;

When using an array of bytes to represent a set of bits, i.e., a [[bit array]] or [[bitset]], the index of the byte in the array associated with a bit &lt;code&gt;n&lt;/code&gt; can be calculated using division:

&lt;source lang="c"&gt;
n / CHAR_BIT
&lt;/source&gt;

where &lt;code&gt;n&lt;/code&gt; is the index of the given bit and &lt;code&gt;CHAR_BIT&lt;/code&gt; gives the number of bits in a C &lt;code&gt;char&lt;/code&gt;.

The index of the bit within the byte indexed by the above can be calculated via a [[modulo operation]]:
&lt;source lang="c"&gt;
n % CHAR_BIT
&lt;/source&gt;

Note: &lt;code&gt;unsigned char&lt;/code&gt; is typically used in C to represent a byte and &lt;code&gt;CHAR_BIT&lt;/code&gt; is most often 8 on modern processors. &lt;code&gt;%&lt;/code&gt; is the C modulo operator.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14372">: ''For Catalan's aliquot sequence conjecture, see [[aliquot sequence]].''

'''Catalan's conjecture''' (or '''Mihăilescu's theorem''') is a [[theorem]] in [[number theory]] that was [[Conjecture|conjectured]] by the mathematician [[Eugène Charles Catalan]] in 1844 and proven in 2002 by [[Preda Mihăilescu]].  The integers 2&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; and 3&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; are two [[perfect power|power]]s of [[natural number]]s whose values (8 and 9, respectively) are consecutive. The theorem states that this is the ''only'' case of two consecutive powers.  That is to say, that the only [[Diophantine equation|solution in the natural numbers]] of
:&lt;math&gt;x^a - y^b = 1&lt;/math&gt;
for ''a'', ''b'' &amp;gt; 1, ''x'', ''y'' &amp;gt; 0 is ''x'' = 3, ''a'' = 2, ''y'' = 2, ''b'' = 3.

==History==
The history of the problem dates back at least to [[Gersonides]], who proved a special case of the conjecture in 1343 where (''x'', ''y'') was restricted to be (2, 3) or (3, 2).  The first significant progress after Catalan made his conjecture came in 1850 when [[Victor-Amédée Lebesgue]] dealt with the case ''b'' = 2.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Victor-Amédée Lebesgue | authorlink=Victor-Amédée Lebesgue | title=Sur l'impossibilité, en nombres entiers, de l'équation ''x&lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt;''=''y''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;+1 | journal=Nouvelles annales de mathématiques | series=1&lt;sup&gt;re&lt;/sup&gt; série | volume=9 | year=1850 | pages=178–181 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1976, [[Robert Tijdeman]] applied [[Baker's method]] in [[transcendental number theory|transcendence theory]] to establish a bound on a,b and used existing results bounding ''x'',''y'' in terms of ''a'', ''b'' to give an effective upper bound for ''x'',''y'',''a'',''b''. Michel Langevin computed a value of exp exp exp exp 730 for the bound.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=13 Lectures on Fermat's Last Theorem | first=Paulo | last=Ribenboim | authorlink=Paulo Ribenboim | publisher=[[Springer-Verlag]] | year=1979 | isbn=0-387-90432-8 | zbl=0456.10006 | page=236 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This resolved Catalan's conjecture for all but a finite number of cases.  Nonetheless, the finite calculation required to complete the proof of the theorem was too time-consuming to perform.

Catalan's conjecture was proven by [[Preda Mihăilescu]] in April 2002. The proof was published in the ''[[Journal für die reine und angewandte Mathematik]]'', 2004. It makes extensive use of the theory of [[cyclotomic field]]s and [[Galois module]]s.  An exposition of the proof was given by [[Yuri Bilu]] in the [[Séminaire Bourbaki]].

==Generalization==

It is a conjecture that for every natural number ''n'', there are only finitely many pairs of perfect powers with difference ''n''. The list below shows, for n ≤ 64, all solutions for perfect powers less than 10&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;, as per {{oeis|id=A076427}}.

See {{oeis|id=A103953}} for the smallest solution (&amp;gt; 0), and {{oeis|id=A076427}} for number of solutions (except 0) for a given ''n''.

==Pillai's conjecture==
{{unsolved|mathematics|Does each positive integer occur only finitely many times as a difference of perfect powers?}}
'''Pillai's conjecture''' concerns a general difference of perfect powers {{OEIS|id=A001597}}: it is an open problem initially proposed by [[S. S. Pillai]], who conjectured that the gaps in the sequence of perfect powers tend to infinity.  This is equivalent to saying that each positive integer occurs only finitely many times as a difference of perfect powers: more generally, in 1931 Pillai conjectured that for fixed positive integers ''A'', ''B'', ''C'' the equation &lt;math&gt;Ax^n - By^m = C&lt;/math&gt; has only finitely many solutions (''x'',''y'',''m'',''n'') with (''m'',''n'') ≠ (2,2).  Pillai proved that the difference &lt;math&gt;|Ax^n - By^m| \gg x^{\lambda n}&lt;/math&gt; for any λ less than 1, uniformly in ''m'' and ''n''.&lt;ref name=rnt&gt;{{ cite book | pages=253–254 | title=Rational Number Theory in the 20th Century: From PNT to FLT | series=Springer Monographs in Mathematics | first=Wladyslaw | last=Narkiewicz | publisher=[[Springer-Verlag]] | year=2011 | isbn=0-857-29531-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The general conjecture would follow from the [[ABC conjecture]].&lt;ref name=rnt/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Schmidt | first=Wolfgang M. | authorlink=Wolfgang M.

[[File:Cavalieri's Principle in Coins.JPG|thumb|250px|Two stacks of British coins with the same volume, illustrating Cavalieri's principle in three dimensions]]

In [[geometry]], '''Cavalieri's principle''', a modern implementation of the '''method of indivisibles''', named after [[Bonaventura Cavalieri]], is as follows:&lt;ref&gt;Howard Eves, "Two Surprising Theorems on Cavalieri Congruence", ''The College Mathematics Journal'', volume 22, number 2, March, 1991), pages 118&amp;ndash;124&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''2-dimensional case''': Suppose two regions in a plane are included between two parallel lines in that plane. If every line parallel to these two lines intersects both regions in line segments of equal length, then the two regions have equal areas.
* '''3-dimensional case''': Suppose two regions in three-space (solids) are included between two parallel planes. If every plane parallel to these two planes intersects both regions in [[cross section (geometry)|cross-sections]] of equal area, then the two regions have equal volumes.

Today Cavalieri's principle is seen as an early step towards [[integral calculus]], and while it is used in some forms, such as its generalization in [[Fubini's theorem]], results using Cavalieri's principle can often be shown more directly via integration. In the other direction, Cavalieri's principle grew out of the ancient Greek [[method of exhaustion]], which used limits but did not use [[infinitesimal]]s.

== History ==
[[File:Bonaventura Cavalieri.jpeg|thumb|right|140px|[[Bonaventura Cavalieri]], the mathematician the principle is named after.]]
Cavalieri's principle was originally called the method of indivisibles, the name it was known by in [[Renaissance Europe]]. Cavalieri developed a complete theory of indivisibles, elaborated in his ''Geometria indivisibilibus continuorum nova quadam ratione promota'' (''Geometry, advanced in a new way by the indivisibles of the continua'', 1635) and his ''Exercitationes geometricae sex'' (''Six geometrical exercises'', 1647).&lt;ref&gt;[[Victor J. Katz|Katz, Victor J.]] (1998), ''A History of Mathematics: An Introduction'' (2nd ed.), Addison-Wesley, p. 477.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 3rd century BC, [[Archimedes]], using a method resembling Cavalieri's principle,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britannica.com/topic/Archimedes-Lost-Method-1084593 "Archimedes' Lost Method"]&lt;/ref&gt; was able to find the volume of a sphere given the volumes of a cone and cylinder in his work ''[[The Method of Mechanical Theorems]]''. In the 5th century AD, [[Zu Chongzhi]] and his son [[Zu Gengzhi]] established a similar method to find a sphere's volume.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Calculus: Early Transcendentals |edition=3 |first1=Dennis G. |last1=Zill |first2=Scott |last2=Wright |first3=Warren S. |last3=Wright |publisher=[[Jones &amp; Bartlett Learning]] |year=2009 |isbn=0-7637-5995-3 |page=xxvii |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R3Hk4Uhb1Z0C}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=R3Hk4Uhb1Z0C&amp;pg=PR27 Extract of page 27]&lt;/ref&gt; The transition from Cavalieri's indivisibles to [[Evangelista Torricelli]]'s and [[John Wallis]]'s [[infinitesimal]]s was a major advance in the history of the [[integral calculus|calculus]]. The indivisibles were entities of [[codimension]] 1, so that a plane figure was thought as made out of an infinity of 1-dimensional lines. Meanwhile, infinitesimals were entities of the same dimension as the figure they make up; thus, a plane figure would be made out of "parallelograms" of infinitesimal width. Applying the formula for the sum of an arithmetic progression, Wallis computed the area of a triangle by partitioning it into infinitesimal parallelograms of width&amp;nbsp;1/∞.

== Examples ==

=== Spheres ===
[[Image:sphere cavalieri.svg|500px|thumb|The disk-shaped cross-section of the sphere has the same area as the ring-shaped cross-section of that part of the cylinder that lies ''outside'' the cone.]]

If one knows that the volume of a [[Cone (geometry)|cone]] is &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{3}\left(\text{base} \times \text{height}\right)&lt;/math&gt;, then one can use Cavalieri's principle to derive the fact that the volume of a [[sphere]] is &lt;math&gt;\frac{4}{3}\pi r^3&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; is the radius.

That is done as follows: Consider a sphere of radius &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; and a cylinder of radius &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; and height &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;. Within the cylinder is the cone whose apex is at the center of one base of the cylinder and whose base is the other base of the cylinder. By the [[Pythagorean theorem]], the plane located &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; units above the "equator" intersects the sphere in a circle of area &lt;math&gt;\pi\left(r^2 - y^2\right)&lt;/math&gt;. The area of the plane's intersection with the part of the cylinder that is ''outside'' of the cone is also &lt;math&gt;\pi\left(r^2 - y^2\right)&lt;/math&gt;. As we can see, the area of every intersection of the circle with the horizontal plane located at any height &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; equals the area of the intersection of the plane with the part of the cylinder that is "outside" of the cone; thus, applying Cavalieri's principle, we could say that the volume of the half sphere equals the volume of the part of the cylinder that is "outside" the cone. The aforementioned volume of the cone is &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{3}&lt;/math&gt; of the volume of the cylinder, thus the volume ''outside'' of the cone is &lt;math&gt;\frac{2}{3}&lt;/math&gt; the volume of the cylinder. Therefore the volume of the upper half of the sphere is &lt;math&gt;\frac{2}{3}&lt;/math&gt; of the volume of the cylinder. The volume of the cylinder is

:&lt;math&gt;\text{base} \times \text{height} = \pi r^2 \cdot r = \pi r^3&lt;/math&gt;

("Base" is in units of ''area''; "height" is in units of ''distance''. Area&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;distance&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;volume.)

Therefore the volume of the upper half-sphere is &lt;math&gt;\frac{2}{3} \pi r^3&lt;/math&gt; and that of the whole sphere is &lt;math&gt;\frac{4}{3} \pi r^3&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Cones and pyramids ===

The fact that the volume of any [[Pyramid (geometry)|pyramid]], regardless of the shape of the base, whether circular as in the case of a cone, or square as in the case of the Egyptian pyramids, or any other shape, is (1/3)&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;base&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;height, can be established by Cavalieri's principle if one knows only that it is true in one case. One may initially establish it in a single case by partitioning the interior of a triangular prism into three pyramidal components of equal volumes. One may show the equality of those three volumes by means of Cavalieri's principle.

In fact, Cavalieri's principle or similar infinitesimal argument is ''necessary'' to compute the volume of cones and even pyramids, which is essentially the content of [[Hilbert's third problem]] – polyhedral pyramids and cones cannot be cut and rearranged into a standard shape, and instead must be compared by infinite (infinitesimal) means. The ancient Greeks used various precursor techniques such as Archimedes's mechanical arguments or [[method of exhaustion]] to compute these volumes.

===The napkin ring problem===

{{main|Napkin ring problem}}

[[Image:sphere bands.svg|thumb|400px|If a hole of height ''h'' is drilled straight through the center of a sphere, the volume of the remaining band does not depend on the size of the sphere. For a larger sphere, the band will be thinner but longer.]]

In what is called the [[napkin ring problem]], one shows by Cavalieri's principle that when a hole is drilled straight through the centre of a sphere where the remaining band has height ''h'', the volume of the remaining material surprisingly does not depend on the size of the sphere.  The cross-section of the remaining ring is a plane annulus, whose area is the difference between the areas of two circles.  By the Pythagorean theorem, the area of one of the two circles is ''π'' times ''r''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''y''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;2&lt;/sup&gt;, where ''r'' is the sphere's radius and ''y'' is the distance from the plane of the equator to the cutting plane, and that of the other is ''π'' times ''r''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;(''h''/2)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.  When these are subtracted, the ''r''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;2&lt;/sup&gt; cancels; hence the lack of dependence of the bottom-line answer upon&amp;nbsp;''r''.

=== Cycloids ===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[visual calculus]]. --&gt;

[[Image:Folded cycloid.svg|thumb|400px|The horizontal cross-section of the region bounded by two cycloidal arcs traced by a point on the same circle rolling in one case clockwise on the line below it, and in the other counterclockwise on the line above it, has the same length as the corresponding horizontal cross-section of the circle.]]

N. Reed has shown&lt;ref&gt;N. Reed, "[[Elementary proof]] of the area under a cycloid", ''[[Mathematical Gazette]]'', volume 70, number 454, December, 1986, pages 290&amp;ndash;291&lt;/ref&gt; how to find the area bounded by a [[cycloid]] by using Cavalieri's principle. A circle of radius ''r'' can roll in a clockwise direction upon a line below it, or in a counterclockwise direction upon a line above it. A point on the circle thereby traces out two cycloids. When the circle has rolled any particular distance, the angle through which it would have turned clockwise and that through which it would have turned counterclockwise are the same. The two points tracing the cycloids are therefore at equal heights. The line through them is therefore horizontal (i.e. parallel to the two lines on which the circle rolls). Consequently each horizontal cross-section of the circle has the same length as the corresponding horizontal cross-section of the region bounded by the two arcs of cyloids.  By Cavalieri's principle, the circle therefore has the same area as that region.

Consider the rectangle bounding a single cycloid arch. From the definition of a cycloid, it has width {{math|2π''r''}} and height {{math|2''r''}}, so its area is four times the area of the circle. Calculate the area within this rectangle that lies above the cycloid arch by bisecting the rectangle at the midpoint where the arch meets the rectangle, rotate one piece by 180° and overlay the other half of the rectangle with it. The new rectangle, of area twice that of the circle, consists of the "lens" region between two cycloids, whose area was calculated above to be the same as that of the circle, and the two regions that formed the region above the cycloid arch in the original rectangle. Thus, the area bounded by a rectangle above a single complete arch of the cycloid has area equal to the area of the circle, and so, the area bounded by the arch is three times the area of the circle.

Seidner, "Vector sampling expansion," IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing.  v. 48. no. 5. 2000. p. 1401&amp;ndash;1416.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

In the sampling theorem, the uncertainty of the interpolation as measured by noise variance is the same as the uncertainty of the sample data when the noise is [[i.i.d.]]&lt;ref&gt;R.C. Bracewell, ''The [[Fourier Transform]] and Its Applications,'' McGraw Hill (1968)&lt;/ref&gt; In his classic 1948 paper founding [[information theory]], [[Claude Shannon]] offered the following generalization of the sampling theorem:&lt;ref name="CES"&gt;Claude E. Shannon, "Communication in the presence of noise", Proc. Institute of Radio Engineers, vol. 37, no.1, pp.&amp;nbsp;10&amp;ndash;21, Jan. 1949. [http://www.stanford.edu/class/ee104/shannonpaper.pdf Reprint as classic paper in: ''Proc. IEEE'', Vol. 86, No. 2, (Feb 1998)]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quotation
 | The 2''TW'' numbers used to specify the function need not be the equally spaced samples used above. For example, the samples can be unevenly spaced, although, if there is considerable bunching, the samples must be known very accurately to give a good reconstruction of the function. The reconstruction process is also more involved with unequal spacing. One can further show that the value of the function and its derivative at every other sample point are sufficient. The value and first and second derivatives at every third sample point give a still different set of parameters which uniquely determine the function. Generally speaking, any set of 2''TW'' independent numbers associated with the function can be used to describe it.
}}

Although true in the absence of noise, many of the expansions proposed by Shannon become [[ill-posed]].  An arbitrarily small amount of noise on the data renders restoration unstable. Such sampling expansions are not useful in practice since sampling noise, such as [[quantization noise]], rules out stable interpolation and therefore any practical use.

===Example===

Shannon's suggestion of simultaneous sampling of the signal and its derivative at half the Nyquist rate results in well behaved interpolation.&lt;ref&gt;Athanasios Papoulis, ''Signal Analysis,'' McGraw-Hill Companies (May 1977)&lt;/ref&gt; The Cheung&amp;ndash;Marks theorem shows counter-intuitively that interlacing signal and derivative samples makes the restoration problem ill-posed.&lt;ref name="BC" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CMT" /&gt;

The theorem also shows sensitivity increases with derivative order.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |first=M. |last=Unser |first2=J. |last2=Zerubia |title=Generalized sampling: stability and performance analysis |journal=Signal Processing, IEEE Transactions |volume=45 |issue=12 |pages=2941–2950 |year=1997 |url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=650255&amp;isnumber=14183 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The theorem==

Generally, the Cheung&amp;ndash;Marks theorem shows the sampling theorem becomes ill-posed when the area ([[integral]]) of the squared magnitude of the [[interpolation function]] over all time is not finite.&lt;ref name="BC" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CMT" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1127">In [[game theory]], a '''contingent cooperator''' is a person or agent who is willing to act in the collective interest, rather than his short-term selfish interest, if he observes a majority of the other agents in the collective doing the same. The apparent contradiction in this stance is resolved by [[game theory]], which shows that in the right circumstances, cooperation with a sufficient number of other participants will have a better outcome for cooperators than pursuing short-term selfish interests.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2676">In cryptography, a '''cryptosystem''' is a suite of cryptographic [[algorithm]]s needed to implement a particular security service, most commonly for achieving confidentiality ([[encryption]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Menezes|first1=A.|last2=Oorschot|first2=P. van|last3=Vanstone|first3=S.|title=Handbook of Applied Cryptography|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=0-8493-8523-7|edition=5th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Typically, a cryptosystem consists of three algorithms: one for [[key generation]], one for encryption, and one for decryption. The term ''[[cipher]]'' (sometimes ''cypher'') is often used to refer to a pair of algorithms, one for encryption and one for decryption. Therefore, the term ''cryptosystem'' is most often used when the key generation algorithm is important.  For this reason, the term ''cryptosystem'' is commonly used to refer to [[public key cryptography|public key]] techniques; however both "cipher" and "cryptosystem" are used for [[Symmetric-key algorithm|symmetric key]] techniques.

== Formal definition ==

Mathematically, a cryptosystem or encryption scheme can be defined as a [[tuple]] &lt;math&gt;(\mathcal{P},\mathcal{C},\mathcal{K},\mathcal{E},\mathcal{D})&lt;/math&gt; with the following properties.

#&lt;math&gt; \mathcal{P}&lt;/math&gt; is a set called the "plaintext space".  Its elements are called plaintexts.    
#&lt;math&gt; \mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt; is a set called the "ciphertext space". Its elements are called ciphertexts.  
#&lt;math&gt; \mathcal{K}&lt;/math&gt; is a set called the "key space".  Its elements are called keys.
#&lt;math&gt; \mathcal{E} = \{ E_k : k \in \mathcal{K} \} &lt;/math&gt; is a set of functions &lt;math&gt;E_k : \mathcal{P} \rightarrow \mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt;. Its elements are called "encryption functions".
#&lt;math&gt; \mathcal{D} = \{ D_k : k \in \mathcal{K} \} &lt;/math&gt; is a set of functions &lt;math&gt;D_k : \mathcal{C} \rightarrow \mathcal{P}&lt;/math&gt;. Its elements are called "decryption functions".

For each &lt;math&gt;e \in \mathcal{K}&lt;/math&gt;, there is &lt;math&gt;d \in \mathcal{K}&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;D_d(E_e(p)) = p&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;p \in \mathcal{P}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Buchmann|first1=Johannes A.|title=Introduction to Cryptography|publisher=Springer|isbn=0-387-20756-2|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Note; typically this definition is modified in order to distinguish an encryption scheme as being either a [[Symmetric-key algorithm|symmetric-key]] or [[Public-key cryptography|public-key]] type of cryptosystem.

== Examples ==

A classical example of a cryptosystem is the [[Caesar cipher]].  A more contemporary example is the [[RSA (cryptosystem)|RSA]] cryptosystem.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11702">In [[mathematics]], '''de Moivre's formula ''' (also known as '''de Moivre's theorem''' and '''de Moivre's identity'''), named after [[Abraham de Moivre]], states that for any [[real number]] {{mvar|x}} and [[integer]] {{mvar|n}} it holds that

:&lt;math&gt;\big(\cos (x) + i \sin (x)\big)^n = \cos (nx) + i \sin (nx),&lt;/math&gt;

where {{mvar|i}} is the [[imaginary unit]] ({{math|''i''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; {{=}} −1}}). While the formula was named after de Moivre, he never stated it in his works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Margaret L. |last1=Lial |first2=John |last2=Hornsby |first3=David I. |last3=Schneider |first4=Daniels |last4=Callie J. |title=College Algebra and Trigonometry|edition=4th |year=2008 |location=Boston |publisher=Pearson/Addison Wesley |isbn=9780321497444 |page=792}}&lt;/ref&gt; The expression {{math|cos(''x'') + ''i'' sin(''x'')}} is sometimes abbreviated to {{math|[[cis (mathematics)|cis]](''x'')}}.

The formula is important because it connects complex numbers and [[trigonometry]]. By expanding the left hand side and then comparing the real and imaginary parts under the assumption that {{mvar|x}} is real, it is possible to derive useful expressions for {{math|cos(''nx'')}} and {{math|sin(''nx'')}} in terms of {{math|cos(''x'')}} and {{math|sin(''x'')}}.

As written, the formula is not valid for non-integer powers {{mvar|n}}. However, there are generalizations of this formula valid for other exponents. These can be used to give explicit expressions for the {{mvar|n}}th [[Root of unity|roots of unity]], that is, complex numbers {{mvar|z}} such that {{math|''z&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;'' {{=}} 1}}.

==Derivation from Euler's formula==
Although historically proven earlier, de Moivre's formula can easily be derived from [[Euler's formula]]

:&lt;math&gt;e^{ix} = \cos x + i\sin x&lt;/math&gt;

and the [[exponentiation|exponential law]] for integer powers

:&lt;math&gt;\left( e^{ix} \right)^n = e^{inx} .&lt;/math&gt;

Then, by [[Euler's formula]],

:&lt;math&gt;e^{inx} = \cos nx + i\sin nx.&lt;/math&gt;

== Proof by induction (for integer ''{{mvar|n}}'') ==
The truth of de Moivre's theorem can be established by using mathematical induction for natural numbers, and extended to all integers from there. For an integer {{mvar|n}}, call the following statement {{math|S(''n'')}}:

:&lt;math&gt;(\cos x + i \sin x)^n = \cos nx + i \sin nx.&lt;/math&gt;

For {{math|''n'' &gt; 0}}, we proceed by [[mathematical induction]]. {{math|S(1)}} is clearly true. For our hypothesis, we assume {{math|S(''k'')}} is true for some natural {{mvar|k}}. That is, we assume

:&lt;math&gt;\left(\cos x + i \sin x\right)^k = \cos kx + i \sin kx. &lt;/math&gt;

Now, considering {{math|S(''k'' + 1)}}:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{alignat}{2}
 \left(\cos x+i\sin x\right)^{k+1} &amp; = \left(\cos x+i\sin x\right)^{k} \left(\cos x+i\sin x\right)\\
 &amp; = \left(\cos kx + i\sin kx \right) \left(\cos x+i\sin x\right) &amp;&amp;\qquad \text{by the induction hypothesis}\\
 &amp; = \cos (kx) \cos x - \sin (kx) \sin x + i \left(\cos (kx) \sin x + \sin (kx) \cos x\right)\\
 &amp; = \cos ((k+1)x) + i\sin ((k+1)x) &amp;&amp;\qquad \text{by the trigonometric identities}
\end{alignat}&lt;/math&gt;

See [[Trigonometric identities#Angle sum and difference identities|angle sum and difference identities]].

We deduce that {{math|S(''k'')}} implies {{math|S(''k'' + 1)}}. By the principle of mathematical induction it follows that the result is true for all natural numbers. Now, {{math|S(0)}} is clearly true since {{math|cos(0''x'') + ''i'' sin(0''x'') {{=}} 1 + 0''i'' {{=}} 1}}. Finally, for the negative integer cases, we consider an exponent of {{math|−''n''}} for natural {{mvar|n}}.

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
 \left(\cos x + i\sin x\right)^{-n} &amp; = \big( \left(\cos x + i\sin x\right)^n \big)^{-1} \\
 &amp; = \left(\cos nx + i\sin nx\right)^{-1} \\
 &amp; = \cos(-nx) + i\sin (-nx). \qquad (*) \\
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
The equation (*) is a result of the identity
:&lt;math&gt;z^{-1} = \frac{\bar z}{|z|^2},&lt;/math&gt;
for {{nowrap|''z'' {{=}} cos (''nx'') + ''i'' sin (''nx'')}}. Hence, {{math|S(''n'')}} holds for all integers {{mvar|n}}.

== Formulae for cosine and sine individually ==
{{See also|List of trigonometric identities}}
Being an equality of [[complex number]]s, one necessarily has equality both of the [[real part]]s and of the [[imaginary part]]s of both members of the equation. If {{mvar|x}}, and therefore also {{math|cos ''x''}} and {{math|sin ''x''}}, are [[real number]]s, then the identity of these parts can be written using [[binomial coefficient]]s. This formula was given by 16th century French mathematician [[François Viète]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\sin(nx) &amp;= \sum_{k=0}^n \binom{n}{k} (\cos x)^k\,(\sin x)^{n-k}\,\sin\frac{(n-k)\pi}{2} \\
\cos(nx) &amp;= \sum_{k=0}^n \binom{n}{k} (\cos x)^k\,(\sin x)^{n-k}\,\cos\frac{(n-k)\pi}{2}.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

In each of these two equations, the final trigonometric function equals one or minus one or zero, thus removing half the entries in each of the sums. These equations are in fact even valid for complex values of {{mvar|x}}, because both sides are [[entire function|entire]] (that is, [[Holomorphic function|holomorphic]] on the whole [[complex plane]]) functions of {{mvar|x}}, and two such functions that coincide on the real axis necessarily coincide everywhere. Here are the concrete instances of these equations for {{math|''n'' {{=}} 2}} and {{math|''n'' {{=}} 3}}:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
 \cos 2x &amp;= \left(\cos x\right)^2 +\left(\left(\cos x\right)^2-1\right) &amp;&amp;= 2\left(\cos x\right)^2-1\\
 \sin 2x &amp;= 2\left(\sin x\right)\left(\cos x\right)\\
 \cos 3x &amp;= \left(\cos x\right)^3 +3\cos x\left(\left(\cos x\right)^2-1\right) &amp;&amp;= 4\left(\cos x\right)^3-3\cos x\\
 \sin 3x &amp;= 3\left(\cos x\right)^2\left(\sin x\right)-\left(\sin x\right)^3 &amp;&amp;= 3\sin x-4\left(\sin x\right)^3.\\
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The right hand side of the formula for {{math|cos ''nx''}} is in fact the value {{math|''T''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(cos ''x'')}} of the [[Chebyshev polynomial]] {{math|''T''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}} at {{math|cos ''x''}}.

== Failure for non-integer powers, and generalization ==
De Moivre's formula does not hold for non-integer powers. The derivation of de Moivre's formula above involves a complex number raised to the integer power {{mvar|n}}. If a complex number is raised to a non-integer power, the result is [[multiple-valued]] (see [[Exponentiation#Failure of power and logarithm identities|failure of power and logarithm identities]]). For example, when {{math|''n'' {{=}} {{sfrac|1|2}}}}, de Moivre's formula gives the following results:

:for {{math|''x'' {{=}} 0}} the formula gives 1&lt;sup&gt;{{frac|1|2}}&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1, and
:for {{math|''x'' {{=}} 2{{pi}}}} the formula gives 1&lt;sup&gt;{{frac|1|2}}&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;−1.

This assigns two different values for the same expression 1&lt;sup&gt;{{frac|1|2}}&lt;/sup&gt;, so the formula is not consistent in this case.

On the other hand, the values 1 and −1 are both square roots of 1. More generally, if {{mvar|z}} and {{mvar|w}} are complex numbers, then

:&lt;math&gt;\left(\cos z + i\sin z\right)^w&lt;/math&gt;

is multi-valued while

:&lt;math&gt;\cos wz + i \sin wz&lt;/math&gt;

is not. However, it is always the case that

:&lt;math&gt;\cos wz + i \sin wz&lt;/math&gt;

is one value of

:&lt;math&gt;\left(\cos z + i\sin z\right)^w.&lt;/math&gt;

===Roots of complex numbers===
A modest extension of the version of de Moivre's formula given in this article can be used to find [[nth root|the {{mvar|n}}th roots]] of a complex number (equivalently, the power of {{math|{{sfrac|1|''n''}}}}).

If {{mvar|z}} is a complex number, written in [[polar form]] as

: &lt;math&gt;z=r\left(\cos x+i\sin x\right),&lt;/math&gt;

then the {{mvar|n}} {{mvar|n}}th roots of {{mvar|z}} are given by

: &lt;math&gt;r^\frac1n \left( \cos \frac{x+2\pi k}{n} + i\sin \frac{x+2\pi k}{n} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

where {{mvar|k}} varies over the integer values from 0 to {{math|''n'' − 1}}.

This formula is also sometimes known as de Moivre's formula.&lt;ref&gt;{{springer|title=De Moivre formula|id=p/d030300}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Analogues in other settings ==

===Hyperbolic trigonometry===

Since {{math|cosh ''x'' + sinh ''x'' {{=}} ''e&lt;sup&gt;x&lt;/sup&gt;''}}, an analog to de Moivre's formula also applies to the [[Hyperbolic function|hyperbolic trigonometry]]. For all {{math|''n'' ∈ ℤ}},
:&lt;math&gt;(\cosh x + \sinh x)^n = \cosh nx + \sinh nx.&lt;/math&gt;
Also, if {{math|''n'' ∈ ℚ}}, then one value of {{math|(cosh ''x'' + sinh ''x'')&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}} will be {{math|cosh ''nx'' + sinh ''nx''}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mukhopadhyay|first=Utpal|title=Some interesting features of hyperbolic functions|journal=Resonance|date=August 2006|volume=11|issue=8|pages=81–85|doi=10.1007/BF02855783}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Extension to complex numbers===

The formula holds for any complex number &lt;math&gt;z=x+iy&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;( \cos z + i \sin z)^n = \cos {nz} + i \sin {nz}.&lt;/math&gt;
where
: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align} \cos z = \cos(x + iy) &amp;= \cos x \cosh y - i \sin x \sinh y\, , \\
\sin z = \sin(x + iy) &amp;= \sin x \cosh y + i \cos x \sinh y\, . \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

===Quaternions===

To find the roots of a [[quaternion]] there is an analogous form of de Moivre's formula. A quaternion in the form
:&lt;math&gt;d + a\mathbf{\hat i} + b\mathbf{\hat j} + c\mathbf{\hat k}&lt;/math&gt;
can be represented in the form
:&lt;math&gt;q = k(\cos \theta + \varepsilon \sin \theta) \qquad \mbox{for } 0 \leq \theta &lt; 2 \pi.&lt;/math&gt;
In this representation,
:&lt;math&gt;k = \sqrt{d^2 + a^2 + b^2 + c^2},&lt;/math&gt;
and the trigonometric functions are defined as
:&lt;math&gt;\cos \theta = \frac{d}{k} \quad \mbox{and} \quad \sin \theta = \pm \frac{\sqrt{a^2 + b^2 + c^2}}{k}.&lt;/math&gt;
In the case that {{math|''a''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ''b''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ''c''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; ≠ 0}},
:&lt;math&gt;\varepsilon = \pm \frac{a\mathbf{\hat i} + b\mathbf{\hat j} + c\mathbf{\hat k}}{\sqrt{a^2 + b^2 + c^2}},&lt;/math&gt;
that is, the unit vector. This leads to the variation of De Moivre's formula:

:&lt;math&gt;q^n = k^n(\cos n \theta + \varepsilon \sin n \theta).&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brand|first=Louis|title=The roots of a quaternion|journal=The American Mathematical Monthly|date=October 1942|volume=49|issue=8|pages=519–520|jstor=2302858|doi=10.2307/2302858}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Example====
To find the [[cube root]]s of
:&lt;math&gt;Q = 1 + \mathbf{\hat i} + \mathbf{\hat j}+ \mathbf{\hat k},&lt;/math&gt;
write the quaternion in the form
:&lt;math&gt;Q = 2\left(\cos \frac{\pi}{3} + \varepsilon \sin \frac{\pi}{3}\right) \qquad \mbox{where } \varepsilon = \frac{\mathbf{\hat i} + \mathbf{\hat j}+ \mathbf{\hat k}}{\sqrt 3}.&lt;/math&gt;
Then the cube roots are given by:
:&lt;math&gt;\sqrt[3]{Q} = \sqrt[3]{2}(\cos \theta + \varepsilon \sin \theta) \qquad \mbox{for } \theta = \frac{\pi}{9}, \frac{7\pi}{9}, \frac{13\pi}{9}.&lt;/math&gt;
=== {{gaps|2|×|2}} matrices ===
Consider the following matrix
&lt;math&gt;A=\begin{pmatrix}\cos\phi &amp; \sin\phi \\ -\sin\phi &amp; \cos\phi \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix}\cos\phi &amp; \sin\phi \\ -\sin\phi &amp; \cos\phi \end{pmatrix}^n=\begin{pmatrix}\cos n\phi &amp; \sin n\phi \\ -\sin n\phi &amp; \cos n\phi \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;. This fact (although it can be proven in the very same way as for complex numbers) is a direct consequence of the fact that the space of matrices of type &lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix}a &amp; b \\ -b &amp; a \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt; is isomorphic to the space of complex numbers.

Burger has been honored as a leader in education and for his innovative work in developing educational and entertaining mathematics electronic textbooks. He has been a keynote speaker, invited special session speaker, or the conference chair at a number of [[American Mathematical Society]], [[Mathematical Association of America]], and the [[National Council of Teachers of Mathematics]] conferences.

During the late 1980s Burger was featured at a stand-up comedy club in Austin, Texas and also was an 'independent contractor', writing for Jay Leno. Humor is an integral tool among his teaching methods. Today he has a weekly, lively program on higher education, thinking, and learning produced by [[NPR]]'s Austin affiliate KUT. The series is aptly called [http://kut.org/topic/higher-ed/ Higher ED], and the episodes are also available on [[iTunes]].

Burger is a pioneer in rich, multimedia Internet lectures that, together with written material, form an electronic textbook. By providing students with the presence of a recorded instructor, the material is much more interactive and engaging compared to traditional text books.&lt;ref name="NYTimesMag"&gt;[[Traub, James]].

It should come as no surprise that someone so visually focused would embrace creativity as one of the cornerstones of his teaching methods:
{{quote|Creativity is a means of making new discoveries or creating new ideas or objects—a means to an end, where the end is originality. Mathematicians are both artists and explorers: artists, because they use original thinking and creativity to make new discoveries; explorers, because, unlike artists, what we create is either true or false given the axioms mathematics has as its pillars. Someone might have a result that they deem "beautiful," but if it’s not true, the mathematics community will not care.&lt;ref name="Creativity"&gt;Stern, Zelda. [http://www.williams.edu/home/focus/creativity/ Can Creativity Be Taught?] ''Williams Alumni Review''. June 2006. Retrieved May 1, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Burger feels that "math trauma" is commonly inflicted upon America's elementary and middle-school students, particularly girls, having received a seventh-grade report card stating: "Eddie is a nice boy, but he'll never do well in arithmetic."&lt;ref name="TimesUnion"/&gt; The problem is not with math, but with the way in which it is taught. "When we teach mathematics, we are not sensitive to the audience. Teachers are performers in front of an audience. Some teachers don't realize they have to reach their audience."&lt;ref name="GlobeFun"&gt;Palmer, Lisa. "[http://www.boston.com/news/globe/education/articles/2005/10/16/mathematics_made_fun/ Mathematics made fun: Williams professor takes creative approach]". ''The Boston Globe''. October 16, 2005. Retrieved May 1, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

He offers his students "challenging questions for which the solution is by no means apparent".&lt;ref name="Creativity" /&gt; For example, when teaching students about [[topology]], he asked students if it is "possible to take a cord of rope {{convert|6|ft|m}} long and tie it snugly around your right ankle and your left ankle, take off your pants, turn them inside out, and put your pants back on without ever cutting the rope?" He proceeded to demonstrate the solution to that challenge, wearing huge [[Boston Red Sox]] boxer shorts under his trousers, at the [[Boston Public Library]] in the summer of 2005.&lt;ref name="GlobeFun" /&gt; He believes that failure is closely tied to creativity:
{{quote|In all my courses, I emphasize the power of failure: learning from failed attempts and taking risks. Five percent of students’ final grades are based on their narrative of failure: how they learned from their failed attempts. I judge the quality of their failure by the size of the risk they’ve taken and the amount of insight they have generated from their mistakes. I do that as an invitation to the student to take risks, to try ideas without fear of failure.&lt;ref name="Creativity"/&gt;}}

"As a professor, I'm basically performing three times a week. I like to be funny and to make my students laugh," he said. In addition to his math courses, Burger teaches a short course in comedy writing during the winter study program at Williams. Combining math with comedy comes from his days as a stand-up comic at the [http://www.austinchronicle.com/gyrobase/Issue/story?oid=oid%3A530510 Laff Stop Comedy Club] in [[Austin, Texas|Austin]] in the late-1980s.&lt;ref name="TimesUnion" /&gt;

=== Assessment of mathematics ===
Burger states that "mathematics is basically an approach to solving difficult problems. The techniques and strategies that we can learn in mathematics are techniques and strategies we can use to solve any difficult problem."&lt;ref name="Top10"&gt;"[http://www.thefutureschannel.com/conversations_archive/burger_conversation.php Conversations - Edward Burger]". The Futures Channel. Retrieved May 1, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; In the textbook he co-authored with Michael Starbird, ''The Heart of Mathematics'', they offer their favorite top ten mathematical ways of thinking:&lt;ref name="Top10" /&gt;
# Just do it
# Make mistakes and fail but never give up
# Keep an open mind
# Explore the consequences of new ideas
# Seek the essential
# Understand the issue
# Understand simple things deeply
# Break a difficult problem into easier ones
# Examine issues from several points of view
# Look for patterns and similarities

Recently, Burger and Starbird expanded their scope beyond mathematics while distilling their "top ten" list down to just five in their book, [http://www.elementsofthinking.com ''The 5 Elements of Effective Thinking'']

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6860">'''Euler substitution''' is a method for evaluating integrals of the form

: &lt;math&gt;\int R(x, \sqrt{ax^2 + bx + c}) \,\mathrm dx,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is a rational function of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{ax^2 + bx + c}&lt;/math&gt;. In such cases, the integrand can be changed to a rational function by using the substitutions of Euler.&lt;ref&gt;N. Piskunov, ''Diferentsiaal- ja integraalarvutus körgematele tehnilistele öppeasutustele. Viies, taiendatud trukk. Kirjastus Valgus'', Tallinn (1965). Note: Euler substitutions can be found in most Russian calculus textbooks.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The first substitution of Euler==
The first substitution of Euler is used when &lt;math&gt;a &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;. We substitute
&lt;math&gt;
 \sqrt{ax^2 + bx + c} = \pm x\sqrt{a} + t
&lt;/math&gt;
and solve the resulting expression for &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;. We have that &lt;math&gt;x = \frac{c - t^2}{\pm 2t\sqrt{a} - b}&lt;/math&gt; and that the &lt;math&gt;\mathrm dx&lt;/math&gt; term is expressible rationally in &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;.

In this substitution, either the positive sign or the negative sign can be chosen.

==The second substitution of Euler==
If &lt;math&gt;c &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;, we take
&lt;math&gt;
 \sqrt{ax^2 + bx + c} = xt \pm \sqrt{c}.
&lt;/math&gt;
We solve for &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; similarly as above and find
&lt;math&gt;x = \frac{\pm 2t\sqrt{c} - b}{a - t^2}.&lt;/math&gt;

Again, either the positive or the negative sign can be chosen.

==The third substitution of Euler==
If the polynomial &lt;math&gt;ax^2 + bx + c&lt;/math&gt; has real roots &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt;, we may choose
&lt;math&gt;\sqrt{ax^2 + bx + c} = \sqrt{a(x - \alpha)(x - \beta)} = (x - \alpha)t&lt;/math&gt;. This yields 
&lt;math&gt;x = \frac{a\beta - \alpha t^2}{a - t^2},&lt;/math&gt;
and as in the preceding cases, we can express the entire integrand rationally in &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;.

==Examples==
{{Expand section|date=April 2018}}
=== Examples for the first substitution of Euler ===

==== One ====
In the integral &lt;math&gt;\int\! \frac{\mathrm dx}{\sqrt{x^2+c}}&lt;/math&gt; we can use the first substitution and set &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{x^2+c} = -x+t&lt;/math&gt;, thus
:&lt;math&gt;x = \frac{t^2-c}{2t} \quad\quad \mathrm dx = \frac{t^2+c}{2t^2}\,\mathrm dt&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\sqrt{x^2+c} = -\frac{t^2-c}{2t}+t = \frac{t^2+c}{2t}&lt;/math&gt;
Accordingly, we obtain:
:&lt;math&gt;\int \frac{\mathrm dx}{\sqrt{x^2+c}} = \int \frac{\frac{t^2+c}{2t^2}}{\frac{t^2+c}{2t}}\, \mathrm dt&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; = \int\!\frac{\mathrm dt}{t} = \ln|t|+C = \ln|x+\sqrt{x^2+c}|+C&lt;/math&gt;
The cases &lt;math&gt;c = \pm 1&lt;/math&gt;, give the formulas
:&lt;math&gt;\int \frac{\mathrm dx}{\sqrt{x^2+1}} = \mbox{arsinh}(x) + C &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\int \frac{\mathrm dx}{\sqrt{x^2-1}} = \mbox{arcosh}(x) + C \quad (x &gt; 1)&lt;/math&gt;

==== Two ====
For finding the value of &lt;math&gt;\int\frac{1}{x\sqrt{x^{2}+4x-4}}dx&lt;/math&gt;, we find &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; using the first substitution of Euler: &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{x^{2}+4x-4} = \sqrt{1}x+t = x+t&lt;/math&gt;. Squaring both sides of the equation gives us &lt;math&gt;x^{2}+4x-4 = x^{2} + 2xt +t^{2}&lt;/math&gt;, from which the &lt;math&gt;x^2&lt;/math&gt; terms will cancel out; solving for &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; yields &lt;math&gt;x=\frac{t^{2}+4}{4-2t}&lt;/math&gt;. From there, we can take derivatives of both sides of the equation, find &lt;math&gt;dx&lt;/math&gt;, and substitute &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;dx&lt;/math&gt; in the integral to find the answer.

&lt;math&gt;dx=\frac{-2t^{2}+8t+8}{(4-2t)^{2}}dt&lt;/math&gt;; &lt;math&gt;\int \frac{dx}{x\sqrt{x^{2}+4x-4}} = \int \frac{\frac{-2t^{2}+8t+8}{(4-2t)^{2}}dt}{(\frac{t^{2}+4}{4-2t})(\frac{-t^{2}+4t+4}{4-2t})} = 2\int \frac{dt}{t^{2}+4}= \tan^{-1}\left(\frac t2\right) +C&lt;/math&gt; and since &lt;math&gt;t=\sqrt{x^{2}+4x-4}-x&lt;/math&gt;, the value of the integral is &lt;math&gt;\int \frac{1}{x\sqrt{x^{2}+4x-4}}dx = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{\sqrt{x^{2}+4x-4}-x}{2}\right)+C&lt;/math&gt;

=== Examples for the second substitution of Euler ===

In the integral &lt;math&gt;\int\! \frac{\mathrm dx}{x\sqrt{-x^2+x+2}}&lt;/math&gt; we can use the second substitution and set &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{-x^2+x+2} = xt + \sqrt{2}&lt;/math&gt;, thus
:&lt;math&gt;x = \frac{1-2\sqrt{2}t}{t^2+1} \quad\quad \mathrm dx = \frac{2\sqrt{2}t^2-2t-2\sqrt{2}}{(t^2+1)^2}\,\mathrm dt&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\sqrt{-x^2+x+2} = \frac{1-2\sqrt{2t}}{t^2+1}t + \sqrt{2} = \frac{-\sqrt{2}t^2+t+\sqrt{2}}{t^2+1}&lt;/math&gt;
Accordingly, we obtain:
:&lt;math&gt;\int \frac{\mathrm dx}{x\sqrt{-x^2+x+2}} = \int \frac{\frac{2\sqrt{2}t^2-2t-2\sqrt{2}}{(t^2+1)^2}}{\frac{1-2\sqrt{2}t}{t^2+1}\frac{-\sqrt{2}t^2+t+\sqrt{2}}{t^2+1}} \mathrm dt =&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; = \int\!\frac{-2}{-2\sqrt{2}t+1}\mathrm dt = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\int\frac{-2\sqrt{2}}{-2\sqrt{2}t+1}\mathrm dt =&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\ln|2\sqrt{2}t-1|+C = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\ln|2\sqrt{2}\frac{\sqrt{-x^2+x+2}}{x}-1|+C&lt;/math&gt;

=== Examples for the third substitution of Euler ===
In the integral &lt;math&gt;\int\! \frac{x^2}{\sqrt{-x^2+3x-2}}\mathrm dx&lt;/math&gt; we can use the third substitution and set &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{-(x-2)(x-1)} = (x-2)t&lt;/math&gt;, thus
:&lt;math&gt;x = \frac{-2t^2-1}{-t^2-1} \quad\quad \mathrm dx = \frac{2t}{(-t^2-1)^2}\,\mathrm dt&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\sqrt{-x^2+3x-2} = (x-2)t = \frac{t}{-t^2-1}&lt;/math&gt;
Accordingly, we obtain:
:&lt;math&gt;\int \frac{x^2}{\sqrt{-x^2+3x-2}}\mathrm dx = \int\frac{(\frac{-2t^2-1}{-t^2-1})^2\frac{2t}{(-t^2-1)^2}}{\frac{t}{-t^2-1}}\mathrm dt = \int\frac{2(-2t^2-1)^2}{((-t^2-1)^2)^3}\mathrm dt&lt;/math&gt;
As we can see this is a rational function which can be solved using partial fractions.

==Generalizations==

The substitutions of Euler can be generalized by allowing the use of imaginary numbers. For example, in the integral &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \int \frac{\mathrm dx}{\sqrt{-x^2 + c}}&lt;/math&gt;, the substitution &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{x^2 + c} = \pm ix + t&lt;/math&gt; can be used. Extensions to the complex numbers allows us to use every type of Euler substitution regardless of the coefficients on the quadratic.

The substitutions of Euler can be generalized to a larger class of functions. Consider integrals of the form

: &lt;math&gt;\int R_1\Big(x, \sqrt{ax^2 + bx + c}\Big) \, \log\Big(R_2\Big(x, \sqrt{ax^2 + bx + c}\Big)\Big) \,\mathrm dx,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;R_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;R_2&lt;/math&gt; are rational functions of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{ax^2 + bx + c}&lt;/math&gt;. This integral can be transformed by the substitution &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{ax^2 + bx + c} = \sqrt{a} + xt&lt;/math&gt; into another integral

: &lt;math&gt;\int \tilde R_1(t) \log\big(\tilde R_2(t)\big) \,\mathrm dt,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\tilde R_1(t)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\tilde R_2(t)&lt;/math&gt; are now simply rational functions of &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;. In principle, [[factorization]] and [[partial fraction decomposition]] can be employed to break the integral down into simple terms, which can be integrated analytically through use of the [[dilogarithm]] function.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Zwillinger |first1=Daniel |title=The Handbook of Integration |publisher=Jones and Bartlett |location=1992 |isbn=978-0867202939 |pages=145–146}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2539">In [[mathematics]], especially in an area of [[abstract algebra]] known as [[representation theory]], a '''faithful representation''' ρ of a [[group (mathematics)|group]] &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; on a [[vector space]] &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is a [[linear representation]] in which different elements &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; are represented by distinct linear mappings &lt;math&gt;\rho(g)&lt;/math&gt;. 

In more abstract language, this means that the [[group homomorphism]]

&lt;math&gt;\rho: G\to GL(V)&lt;/math&gt;

is [[injective]] (or [[injective|one-to-one]]).

''Caveat:'' While representations of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; over a field &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; are ''de facto'' the same as &lt;math&gt;K[G]&lt;/math&gt;-modules (with &lt;math&gt;K[G]&lt;/math&gt; denoting the [[Group_ring#Group_algebra_over_a_finite_group|group algebra]] of the group &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;), a faithful representation of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is not necessarily a [[faithful module]] for the group algebra. In fact each faithful &lt;math&gt;K[G]&lt;/math&gt;-module is a faithful representation of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;, but the converse does not hold. Consider for example the natural representation of the [[symmetric group]] &lt;math&gt;S_n&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; dimensions by [[permutation matrices]], which is certainly faithful. Here the order of the group is &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;! while the &lt;math&gt;n\times n&lt;/math&gt; matrices form a vector space of dimension &lt;math&gt;n^2&lt;/math&gt;. As soon as &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is at least 4, dimension counting means that some linear dependence must occur between permutation matrices (since &lt;math&gt;24 &gt; 16&lt;/math&gt;); this relation means that the module for the group algebra is not faithful.

==Properties==

A representation &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; of a finite group &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; over an algebraically closed field &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; of characteristic zero is faithful (as a representation) if and only if every irreducible representation of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; occurs as a subrepresentation of &lt;math&gt;S^nV&lt;/math&gt; (the &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-th symmetric power of the representation &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;) for a sufficiently high &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;. Also, &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is faithful (as a representation) if and only if every irreducible representation of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; occurs as a subrepresentation of
: &lt;math&gt;V^{\otimes n}=\underbrace{V\otimes V\otimes \cdots\otimes V}_{n\text{ times}}&lt;/math&gt;
(the &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-th tensor power of the representation &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;) for a sufficiently high &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;.{{citationneeded|date=December 2015}}

A '''fuzzy number''' is a generalization of a regular, real number in the sense that it does not refer to one single value but rather to a connected set of possible values, where each possible value has its own weight between 0 and 1&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dijkman|first=J.G|last2=Haeringen|first2=H van|last3=Lange|first3=S.J de|title=Fuzzy numbers|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/0022-247X(83)90253-6|journal=Journal of Mathematical Analysis and Applications|language=en|volume=92|issue=2|pages=301–341|doi=10.1016/0022-247x(83)90253-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;. This weight is called the [[Membership function (mathematics)|membership function]]. A fuzzy number is thus a special case of a convex, normalized [[fuzzy set]] of the real line.&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Hanss]], 2005. ''Applied Fuzzy Arithmetic, An Introduction with Engineering Applications''. Springer, {{ISBN|3-540-24201-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Just like [[Fuzzy logic]] is an extension of [[Boolean logic]] (which uses absolute truth and falsehood only, and nothing in between), fuzzy numbers are an extension of [[real numbers]]. Calculations with fuzzy numbers allow the incorporation of [[uncertainty]] on parameters, properties, geometry, initial conditions, etc.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13769">The '''gauge covariant derivative''' is a variation of the [[covariant derivative]] used in [[general relativity]]. If a theory has [[gauge transformation]]s, it means that some physical properties of certain equations are preserved under those transformations.  Likewise, the gauge covariant derivative is the ordinary derivative modified in such a way as to make it behave like a true vector operator, so that equations written using the covariant derivative preserve their physical properties under gauge transformations.

==Overview==
There are many ways in which to understand the gauge covariant derivative. The approach taken in this article is based on the historically traditional notation used in many physics textbooks.&lt;ref&gt;L.D. Faddeev, A.A. Slavnov, ''Gauge Fields: Introduction to Gauge Theory'', (1980) Benjamin Cummings, {{ISBN|0-8053-9016-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Claude Itzykson, Jean-Bernard Zuber, ''Quantum Field Theory'' (1980) McGraw-Hill {{ISBN|0-07-032071-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Warren Siegel, ''[https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/9912205 Fields]'' (1999) ArXiv&lt;/ref&gt;  Another approach is to understand the gauge covariant derivative as a kind of [[Connection (mathematics)|connection]], and more specifically, an [[affine connection]].&lt;ref&gt;Richard S. Palais, ''[http://vmm.math.uci.edu/GeometrizationOfPhysics.pdf The Geometrization of Physics]'' (1981) Lecture Notes, Institute of Mathematics, National Tsing Hua University&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M. E. Mayer, "[http://projecteuclid.org/download/pdf_1/euclid.bams/1183550979 Review: David D. Bleecker, Gauge theory and variational principles]", ''Bull. Amer. Math. Soc. (N.S.)'' '''9''' (1983), no. 1, 83--92&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="guay"&gt;Alexandre Guay, ''[http://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/2133/1/geometrie.pdf Geometrical aspects of local gauge symmetry]'' (2004)&lt;/ref&gt; The affine connection is interesting because it does not require any concept of a [[metric tensor]] to be defined; the [[curvature]] of an affine connection can be understood as the [[field strength]] of the gauge potential.  When a metric is available, then one can go in a different direction, and define a connection on a [[frame bundle]]. This path leads directly to general relativity; however, it requires a metric, which [[particle physics]] [[gauge theory|gauge theories]] do not have.

Rather than being generalizations of one-another, affine and metric geometry go off in different directions: the [[gauge group]] of ([[Pseudo-Riemannian geometry|pseudo-]])[[Riemannian geometry]] ''must'' be the [[indefinite orthogonal group]] O(s,r) in general, or the [[Lorentz group]] O(3,1) for [[space-time]]. This is because the fibers of the [[frame bundle]] must necessarily, by definition, connect the [[tangent space|tangent]] and [[cotangent space]]s of space-time.&lt;ref name="MTW"&gt;Charles W. Misner, Kip S. Thorne, and John Archibald Wheeler, ''[[Gravitation (book)|Gravitation]]'', (1973) W. H. Freeman and Company&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, the gauge groups employed in particle physics could be (in principle) any [[Lie group]] at all (and, in practice, being only [[U(1)]], [[SU(2)]] or [[SU(3)]] in the [[Standard Model]]).  Note that Lie groups do not come equipped with a metric.

A yet more complicated, yet more accurate and geometrically enlightening, approach is to understand that the gauge covariant derivative is (exactly) the same thing as the [[exterior covariant derivative]] on a [[section (fiber bundle)|section]] of an [[associated bundle]] for the [[principal bundle|principal fiber bundle]] of the gauge theory;&lt;ref&gt;David Bleecker, "[https://zulfahmed.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/88623149-bleecker-d-gauge-theory-and-variational-principles-aw-1981-ka-t-201s-pqgf.pdf Gauge Theory and Variational Principles]" (1982) D. Reidel Publishing ''(See chapter 3'')&lt;/ref&gt; and, for the case of spinors, the associated bundle would be a [[spin bundle]] of the [[spin structure]].&lt;ref&gt;David Bleecker, ''op. cit.'' (''See Chapter 6.'')&lt;/ref&gt; Although conceptually the same, this approach uses a very different set of notation, and requires a far more advanced background in multiple areas of [[differential geometry]].

The final step in the geometrization of gauge invariance is to recognize that, in quantum theory, one needs only to compare neighboring fibers of the principal fiber bundle, and that the fibers themselves provide a superfluous extra description.  This leads to the idea of modding out the gauge group to obtain the [[Atiyah algebroid|gauge groupoid]] as the closest description of the gauge connection in quantum field theory.&lt;ref name="guay"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Meinhard E. Mayer, "Principal Bundles versus Lie Groupoids in Gauge Theory", (1990) in ''Differential Geometric Methods in Theoretical Physics'', Volume '''245''' pp 793-802&lt;/ref&gt;

For ordinary Lie algebras, the gauge covariant derivative on the space symmetries (those of the pseudo-Riemannian manifold and general relativity) cannot be intertwined with the internal gauge symmetries; that is, metric geometry and affine geometry are necessarily distinct mathematical subjects: this is the content of the [[Coleman–Mandula theorem]]. However, a premise of this theorem is violated by the [[Lie superalgebra]]s (which are ''not'' Lie algebras!) thus offering hope that a single unified symmetry can describe both spatial and internal symmetries: this is the foundation of [[supersymmetry]].

The more mathematical approach uses an index-free notation, emphasizing the geometric and algebraic structure of the gauge theory and its relationship to [[Lie algebras]] and [[Riemannian manifold]]s; for example, treating gauge covariance as [[equivariance]] on fibers of a fiber bundle. The index notation used in physics makes it far more convenient for practical calculations, although it makes the overall geometric structure of the theory more opaque.&lt;ref name="MTW"/&gt;  The physics approach also has a pedagogical advantage: the general structure of a gauge theory can be exposed after a minimal background in [[multivariate calculus]], whereas the geometric approach requires a large investment of time in the general theory of [[differential geometry]], [[Riemannian manifold]]s, [[Lie algebras]], [[representation of a Lie group|representations of Lie algebras]] and [[principle bundle]]s before a general understanding can be developed. In more advanced discussions, both notations are commonly intermixed.

This article attempts to hew most closely to the notation and language commonly employed in physics curriculum, touching only briefly on the more abstract connections.

==Fluid dynamics==
In [[fluid dynamics]], the gauge covariant derivative of a fluid may be defined as
:&lt;math&gt; \nabla_t \mathbf{v}:= \partial_t \mathbf{v} + (\mathbf{v} \cdot \nabla) \mathbf{v}&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}&lt;/math&gt; is a velocity [[vector field]] of a fluid.

==Gauge theory==
In [[gauge theory]], which studies a particular class of [[field (physics)|fields]] which are of importance in [[quantum field theory]], the [[minimal coupling|minimally-coupled]] gauge covariant derivative is defined as
:&lt;math&gt; D_\mu := \partial_\mu - i e A_\mu &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;A_\mu&lt;/math&gt; is the [[electromagnetic four potential]].

(Note that this is valid for a Minkowski [[metric signature]] &lt;math&gt;(-, +, +, +)&lt;/math&gt;, which is used in this article. For &lt;math&gt;(+, -, -, -)&lt;/math&gt; the minus becomes a plus.)

===Construction of the covariant derivative through the comparator===

===Construction of the covariant derivative through gauge covariance requirement===
Consider a generic (possibly non-Abelian) Gauge transformation, defined by a symmetry operator &lt;math&gt;U(x)= e^{i\alpha(x)}&lt;/math&gt;, acting on a field &lt;math&gt;\phi(x)&lt;/math&gt;, such that
:&lt;math&gt; \phi(x) \rightarrow \phi'(x) = U(x) \phi(x) \equiv e^{i\alpha(x)} \phi(x), &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \phi^\dagger(x) \rightarrow \phi{'}^{\dagger} = \phi^\dagger(x) U^\dagger (x) \equiv \phi^\dagger(x) e^{-i\alpha(x)}, \qquad U^\dagger = U^{-1}. &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\alpha(x)&lt;/math&gt; is an element of the [[Lie algebra]] associated with the [[Lie group]] of symmetry transformations, and can be expressed in terms of the generators of the group, &lt;math&gt;\{t^a\}_{a}&lt;/math&gt;, as &lt;math&gt;\alpha(x) = \alpha^a(x) t^a&lt;/math&gt;.

The partial derivative &lt;math&gt;\partial_\mu&lt;/math&gt; transforms, accordingly, as
:&lt;math&gt; \partial_\mu \phi(x)
\rightarrow \partial_\mu \phi'(x) = U(x) \partial_\mu \phi(x) + (\partial_\mu U) \phi(x)
\equiv e^{i\alpha(x)} \partial_\mu \phi(x) + i (\partial_\mu \alpha) e^{i\alpha(x)} \phi(x) &lt;/math&gt;
and a kinetic term of the form &lt;math&gt; \phi^\dagger \partial_\mu \phi&lt;/math&gt; is thus not invariant under this transformation.

We can introduce the covariant derivative &lt;math&gt;D_\mu&lt;/math&gt; in this context as a generalization of the partial derivative &lt;math&gt;\partial_\mu&lt;/math&gt; which transforms covariantly under the Gauge transformation, i.e. an object satisfying
:&lt;math&gt; D_\mu \phi(x) \rightarrow D'_\mu \phi'(x) = U(x) D_\mu \phi(x), &lt;/math&gt;
which in operatorial form takes the form
:&lt;math&gt; D'_\mu = U(x) D_\mu U^\dagger(x).&lt;/math&gt;
We thus compute (omitting the explicit &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; dependencies for brevity)
:&lt;math&gt; D_\mu \phi \rightarrow D'_\mu U \phi = UD_\mu \phi + (\delta D_\mu U + [D_\mu,U])\phi&lt;/math&gt;,
where
:&lt;math&gt; D_\mu \rightarrow D'_\mu \equiv D_\mu + \delta D_\mu&lt;/math&gt;.

The requirement for &lt;math&gt;D_\mu&lt;/math&gt; to transform covariantly is now translated in the condition
:&lt;math&gt; (\delta D_\mu U + [D_\mu,U])\phi = 0. &lt;/math&gt;
To obtain an explicit expression, we follow [[Quantum electrodynamics|QED]] and make the Ansatz
:&lt;math&gt; D_\mu = \partial_\mu - ig A_\mu, &lt;/math&gt;
where the vector field &lt;math&gt;A_\mu&lt;/math&gt; satisfies,
:&lt;math&gt; A_\mu \rightarrow A'_\mu = A_\mu + \delta A_\mu,&lt;/math&gt;

from which it follows that
:&lt;math&gt; \delta D_\mu \equiv -ig \delta A_\mu &lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt; \delta A_\mu = [U,A_\mu]U^\dagger -\frac{i}{g} [\partial_\mu,U]U^\dagger &lt;/math&gt;
which, using &lt;math&gt;U(x) = 1 + i \alpha(x) + \mathcal{O}(\alpha^2) &lt;/math&gt;, takes the form
:&lt;math&gt; \delta A_\mu = \frac{1}{g} ( [\partial_\mu, \alpha] - ig [A_\mu,\alpha] ) + \mathcal{O}(\alpha^2) = \frac{1}{g} [D_\mu, \alpha] + \mathcal{O}(\alpha^2)&lt;/math&gt;

We have thus found an object &lt;math&gt;D_\mu&lt;/math&gt; such that
:&lt;math&gt; \phi^\dagger(x) D_\mu \phi(x) \rightarrow \phi'^\dagger(x) D'_\mu \phi'(x) = \phi^\dagger(x) D_\mu \phi(x).&lt;/math&gt;

===Quantum electrodynamics===
If a gauge transformation is given by
:&lt;math&gt; \psi \mapsto e^{i\Lambda} \psi &lt;/math&gt;
and for the gauge potential 
:&lt;math&gt; A_\mu \mapsto A_\mu + {1 \over e} (\partial_\mu \Lambda) &lt;/math&gt;
then &lt;math&gt; D_\mu &lt;/math&gt; transforms as
:&lt;math&gt; D_\mu \mapsto \partial_\mu - i e A_\mu - i (\partial_\mu \Lambda) &lt;/math&gt;,
and &lt;math&gt; D_\mu \psi &lt;/math&gt; transforms as
:&lt;math&gt; D_\mu \psi \mapsto e^{i \Lambda} D_\mu \psi &lt;/math&gt;
and &lt;math&gt; \bar \psi := \psi^\dagger \gamma^0 &lt;/math&gt; transforms as
:&lt;math&gt; \bar \psi \mapsto \bar \psi e^{-i \Lambda} &lt;/math&gt;
so that
:&lt;math&gt; \bar \psi D_\mu \psi \mapsto \bar \psi D_\mu \psi &lt;/math&gt;
and &lt;math&gt; \bar \psi D_\mu \psi &lt;/math&gt; in the QED [[Lagrangian (field theory)|Lagrangian]] is therefore gauge invariant, and the gauge covariant derivative is thus named aptly.

On the other hand, the non-covariant derivative &lt;math&gt; \partial_\mu &lt;/math&gt; would not preserve the Lagrangian's gauge symmetry, since
:&lt;math&gt; \bar \psi \partial_\mu \psi \mapsto \bar \psi \partial_\mu \psi + i \bar \psi (\partial_\mu \Lambda) \psi &lt;/math&gt;.

===Quantum chromodynamics===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Lagrangian (field theory)|Lagrangian]] --&gt;
In [[quantum chromodynamics]], the gauge covariant derivative is&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fuw.edu.pl/~dobaczew/maub-42w/node9.html&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; D_\mu := \partial_\mu - i g \, A_\mu^\alpha \,  \lambda_\alpha /2 &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; is the [[coupling constant]], &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is the gluon [[gauge field]], for eight different gluons &lt;math&gt;\alpha=1 \dots 8&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt; is a four-component [[Dirac spinor]], and where &lt;math&gt;\lambda_\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is one of the eight [[Gell-Mann matrices]], &lt;math&gt;\alpha=1 \dots 8&lt;/math&gt;.  The Gell-Mann matricies give a [[representation of a Lie group|representation]] of the [[color symmetry]] group [[SU(3)]]. For quarks, the representation is the [[fundamental representation]], for gluons, the representation is the [[adjoint representation]].

===Standard Model===
The covariant derivative in the [[Standard Model]] can be expressed in the following form:&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. eq. 3.116 in C. Tully, ''Elementary Particle Physics in a Nutshell'', 2011, Princeton University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; D_\mu := \partial_\mu - i \frac{g_1}{2} \,  Y \, B_\mu - i \frac{g_2}{2} \,  \sigma_j \, W_\mu^j - i \frac{g_3}{2} \,  \lambda_\alpha \, G_\mu^\alpha &lt;/math&gt;

The gauge fields here belong to the [[fundamental representation]]s of the [[electroweak]] [[Lie group]] &lt;math&gt;U(1)\otimes SU(2)&lt;/math&gt; times the [[color symmetry]] Lie group [[SU(3)]].

==General relativity==
In [[general relativity]], the gauge covariant derivative is defined as
:&lt;math&gt; \nabla_j v^i := \partial_j v^i + \sum_k\Gamma^i{}_{j k} v^k &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\Gamma^i{}_{j k}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Christoffel symbol]].  More formally, this derivative can be understood as the [[Riemannian connection]] on a [[frame bundle]].  The "gauge freedom" here is the arbitrary choice of a [[coordinate frame]] at each point in [[space-time]].

==Biography==
Born March 30, 1876 to a [[New Jersey]] insurance claims adjuster and a housewife, and raised in [[Massachusetts]], her family tree included colonial settlers. Young Helen's formal education started at a high school in Massachusetts, and after graduating she went to [[Wellesley College]], where she intended to major in Greek and Latin. Unusually, the mathematics faculty at the college consisted mostly of women, including [[Ellen Hayes]], and before completing her first years, Helen Merrill had decided to major in mathematics instead of languages. In 1893 she began teaching at Wellesley while also studying and guest lecturing abroad. In 1903 she earned a PhD in mathematics at Yale under the direction of [[James Pierpont (mathematician)|James Pierpont]]. In 1920 she was appointed vice-president of the [[Mathematical Association of America]]. Upon her retirement from Wellesley, she was given the title [[Professor Emerita]].

At Wellesley, Merrill wrote two textbooks with [[Clara Eliza Smith]], ''Selected Topics in Higher Algebra'' (Norwood, 1914) and ''A First Course in Higher Algebra'' (Macmillan, 1917).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://www.agnesscott.edu/lriddle/women/smith.htm|title=Clara Eliza Smith|work=Biographies of Women Mathematicians|first=Larry|last=Riddle|publisher=Agnes Scott College|date=February 25, 2016|accessdate=2018-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Reviews of ''A First Course in Higher Algebra'':

In algebra, '''[[Hua Luogeng|Hua]]'s identity'''&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cohn|2003|loc=§9.1}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- named after --&gt; states that for any elements ''a'', ''b'' in a [[division ring]],
:&lt;math&gt;a - (a^{-1} + (b^{-1} - a)^{-1})^{-1} = aba&lt;/math&gt;
whenever &lt;math&gt;ab \ne 0, 1&lt;/math&gt;. Replacing &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;-b^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; gives another equivalent form of the identity:
:&lt;math&gt;(a+ab^{-1}a)^{-1} + (a+b)^{-1} =a^{-1}.&lt;/math&gt;

An important application of the identity is a proof of '''Hua's theorem'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cohn|2003|loc=Theorem 9.1.3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/161301/is-this-map-of-domains-a-jordan-homomorphism|title=Is this map of domains a Jordan homomorphism?|website=math.stackexchange.com|access-date=2016-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theorem says that if &lt;math&gt;\sigma: K \to L&lt;/math&gt; is a [[function (mathematics)|function]] between division rings and if &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; satisfies:
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma(a + b) = \sigma(a) + \sigma(b), \quad \sigma(1) = 1, \quad \sigma(a^{-1}) = \sigma(a)^{-1},&lt;/math&gt;
then &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; is either a [[Ring homomorphism|homomorphism]] or an [[antihomomorphism]]. The theorem is important because of the connection to the [[fundamental theorem of projective geometry]].

== Proof ==
&lt;math&gt;(a - aba)(a^{-1} + (b^{-1} - a)^{-1}) = 1 - ab + ab(b^{-1} - a)(b^{-1} - a)^{-1} = 1.&lt;/math&gt;

(Note the proof is valid in any ring as long as &lt;math&gt;a, b, ab - 1&lt;/math&gt; are [[unit (ring theory)|unit]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jacobson|loc=§ 2.2. Exercise 9.}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

[[Image:x cubed plot.svg|thumb|150px|Plot of {{math|1=''y'' = ''x''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}} with an inflection point at (0,0), which is also a [[stationary point]].]]
{{Cubic graph special points.svg}}
In [[differential calculus]], an '''inflection point''', '''point of inflection''', '''flex''', or '''inflection''' (British English: '''inflexion''') is a point on a [[continuously differentiable function|continuously differentiable]] [[plane curve]] at which the curve crosses its tangent, that is, the curve changes from being [[Concave function|concave]] (concave downward) to [[convex function|convex]] (concave upward), or vice versa.

If the curve is the [[graph of a function]] {{math|1=''y'' = ''f''(''x'')}}, of [[differentiability class]] {{math|''C''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}, this means that the [[second derivative]] of {{mvar|f}} vanishes and changes sign at the point. A point where the second derivative vanishes but does not change sign is sometimes called a '''point of undulation''' or '''undulation point'''.

In algebraic geometry an inflection point is defined slightly more generally, as a [[regular point of an algebraic variety|regular point]] where the tangent meets the curve to [[Glossary of classical algebraic geometry#O|order]] at least 3, and an undulation point or '''hyperflex''' is defined as a point where the tangent meets the curve to order at least 4.

==Definition==
Inflection points are the points of the curve where the curvature changes its sign while a tangent exists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bronshtein |last2=Semendyayev |title=Handbook of Mathematics |edition=4th |location=Berlin |publisher=Springer |year=2004 |isbn=3-540-43491-7 |page=231 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[differentiable function]] has an inflection point at (''x'', ''f''(''x'')) if and only if its [[derivative|first derivative]], ''f′'', has an [[isolated point|isolated]] [[extremum]] at ''x''. (This is not the same as saying that ''f'' has an extremum).  That is, in some neighborhood, ''x'' is the one and only point at which ''f′'' has a (local) minimum or maximum.  If all [[extremum|extrema]] of ''f′'' are [[isolated point|isolated]], then an inflection point is a point on the graph of ''f'' at which the [[tangent]] crosses the curve.

A  ''rising point of inflection'' is an inflection point where the derivative has a local minimum, and a ''falling point of inflection'' is a point where the derivative has a local maximum.

For an [[algebraic curve]], a non singular point is an inflection point if and only if the [[Multiplicity (mathematics)|multiplicity]] of the intersection of the tangent line and the curve (at the point of tangency) is odd and greater than 2.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.encyclopediaofmath.org/index.php/Point_of_inflection|title=Point of inflection|work=encyclopediaofmath.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For a curve given by [[parametric equation]]s, a point is an inflection point if its [[Curvature#Signed curvature|signed curvature]] changes from plus to minus or from minus to plus, i.e., changes [[sign (mathematics)|sign]].

For a twice differentiable function, an inflection point is a point on the graph at which the [[second derivative]] has an isolated zero and changes sign.

[[Image:Animated illustration of inflection point.gif|500px|thumb|Plot of ''f''(''x'') = sin(2''x'') from −{{pi}}/4 to 5{{pi}}/4; note ''f''’s second [[derivative]] is ''f″''(''x'') = –4sin(2''x''). Tangent is blue where the curve is [[convex function|convex]] (above its own [[tangent line|tangent]]), green where concave (below its tangent), and red at inflection points: 0, {{pi}}/2 and {{pi}}]]

==A necessary but not sufficient condition==
If ''x'' is an inflection point for ''f'' then the second derivative, ''f″''(''x''), is equal to zero if it exists, but this condition does not provide a [[Sufficient condition|sufficient]] definition of a point of inflection. One also needs the lowest-order (above the second) non-zero derivative to be of odd order (third, fifth, etc.). If the lowest-order non-zero derivative is of even order, the point is not a point of inflection, but an ''undulation point''. However, in algebraic geometry, both inflection points and undulation points are usually called ''inflection points''. An example of such an undulation point is ''x'' = 0 for the function ''f'' given by ''f''(''x'') = ''x''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;.

This definition assumes that ''f'' has some higher-order non-zero derivative at ''x'', which is not necessarily the case, But if it has one, it follows from the definition that the sign of ''f′''(''x'') is the same on either side of ''x'' in a [[neighborhood (mathematics)|neighborhood]] of ''x''.  If this is [[positive number|positive]], the point is a ''rising point of inflection''; if it is [[negative number|negative]], the point is a ''falling point of inflection''.

'''Inflection points sufficient conditions:'''

1) A sufficient existence condition for a point of inflection is:
:If ''f''(''x'') is ''k'' times continuously differentiable in a certain neighbourhood of a point ''x'' with ''k'' odd and ''k'' ≥ 3, while ''f''&lt;sup&gt;(''n'')&lt;/sup&gt;(''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 for ''n'' = 2,...,''k''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1 and ''f''&lt;sup&gt;(''k'')&lt;/sup&gt;(''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;)&amp;nbsp;≠&amp;nbsp;0 then ''f''(''x'') has a point of inflection at ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;.

2) Another sufficient existence condition requires ''f′′''(''x'' + ε) and ''f′′''(''x''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''ε'') to have opposite signs in the neighborhood of&amp;nbsp;''x'' , if also a tangent exists here. ([[Bronshtein and Semendyayev]] 2004, p.&amp;nbsp;231).

==Categorization of points of inflection==
[[Image:X to the 4th minus x.svg|250px|thumb|''y'' = ''x''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; – ''x'' has a 2nd derivative of zero at point (0,0), but it is not an 
inflection point because the fourth derivative is the first higher order non-zero derivative (the third derivative is zero as well).]]

Points of inflection can also be categorized according to whether ''f′''(''x'') is zero or not zero.
* if ''f′''(''x'') is zero, the point is a ''[[stationary point]] of inflection''
* if ''f′''(''x'') is not zero, the point is a ''non-stationary point of inflection''

A stationary point of inflection is not a [[local extremum]]. More generally, in the context of [[functions of several real variables]], a stationary point that is not a local extremum is called a [[saddle point#Mathematical discussion|saddle point]].

An example of a stationary point of inflection is the point (0,0) on the graph of ''y'' = ''x''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.  The tangent is the ''x''-axis, which cuts the graph at this point.

An example of a non-stationary point of inflection is the point (0,0) on the graph of ''y'' = ''x''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; + ''ax'', for any nonzero ''a''. The tangent at the origin is the line ''y'' = ''ax'', which cuts the graph at this point.

==Functions with discontinuities==
Some functions change concavity without having points of inflection. Instead, they can change concavity around vertical asymptotes or discontinuities. For example, the function &lt;math&gt;x\mapsto \frac1x&lt;/math&gt; is concave for negative {{mvar|x}} and convex for positive {{mvar|x}}, but it has no points of inflection because 0 is not in the domain of the function.

[[File:hyperbola E.svg|thumb|right|[[Euler's number]] '''e''' corresponds to shaded area equal to 1, introduced in chapter VII]]
'''''Introductio in analysin infinitorum''''' ('''''Introduction to the Analysis of the Infinite''''') is a two-volume work by [[Leonhard Euler]] which lays the foundations of [[mathematical analysis]]. Written in [[Latin]] and published in 1748, the ''Introductio'' contains 18 chapters in the first part and 22 chapters in the second. It has [[Eneström index|Eneström numbers]] E101 and E102.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://eulerarchive.maa.org/pages/E101.html|title=E101 -- Introductio in analysin infinitorum, volume 1|last=|first=|date=|website=The Euler Archive|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://eulerarchive.maa.org/pages/E102.html|title=E102 -- Introductio in analysin infinitorum, volume 2|last=|first=|date=|website=The Euler Archive|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Carl Benjamin Boyer|Carl Boyer]]'s lectures at the 1950 [[International Congress of Mathematicians]] compared the influence of  Euler's ''Introductio'' to that of [[Euclid]]'s ''[[Euclid's Elements|Elements]]'', calling the ''Elements'' the foremost textbook of ancient times, and the ''Introductio'' "the foremost textbook of modern times".&lt;ref name="Boyer"&gt;{{cite journal|author=[[Carl Boyer]] |title=The Foremost Textbook of Modern Times| volume= 58| issue= 4|date=April 1951|pages= 223–226 |format= |journal=[[American Mathematical Monthly]] |accessdate= |doi=10.2307/2306956 |publisher=Mathematical Association of America|jstor=2306956}}&lt;/ref&gt; Boyer also wrote:
:The analysis of Euler comes close to the modern orthodox discipline, the study of functions by means of infinite processes, especially through infinite series.
:It is doubtful that any other essentially didactic work includes as large a portion of original material that survives in the college courses today...Can be read with comparative ease by the modern student...The prototype of modern textbooks.

Frederick Rickey]].&lt;ref&gt;V. Frederick Rickey [http://fredrickey.info/hm/Euler-Introductio.pdf  A Reader’s Guide to Euler’s Introductio]&lt;/ref&gt;

Chapter 1 is on the concepts of [[variable (mathematics)|variable]]s and [[function (mathematics)|function]]s. Chapter 4 introduces [[infinite series]] through [[rational function]]s.

According to [[Henk Bos (historian)|Henk Bos]],
:The ''Introduction'' is meant as a survey of concepts and methods in analysis and analytic geometry preliminary to the study of the differential and integral calculus. [Euler] made of this survey a masterly exercise in introducing as much as possible of analysis without using differentiation or integration. In particular, he introduced the elementary transcendental functions, the logarithm, the exponential function, the trigonometric functions and their inverses without recourse to integral calculus — which was no mean feat, as the logarithm was traditionally linked to the quadrature of the hyperbola and the trigonometric functions to the arc-length of the circle.&lt;ref&gt;[[H. J. M. Bos]] (1980) "Newton, Leibnitz and the Leibnizian tradition", chapter 2, pages 49–93, quote page 76, in ''From the Calculus to Set Theory, 1630 – 1910: An Introductory History'', edited by [[Ivor Grattan-Guinness]], [[Duckworth Overlook|Duckworth]] {{ISBN|0-7156-1295-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Euler accomplished this feat by introducing [[exponentiation]] ''a''&lt;sup&gt;''x''&lt;/sup&gt; for arbitrary constant ''a'' in the [[positive real numbers]]. He noted that mapping ''x'' this way is ''not'' an [[algebraic function]], but rather a [[transcendental function]]. For ''a'' &gt; 1 these functions are monotonic increasing and form bijections of the real line with positive real numbers. Then each base ''a'' corresponds to an inverse function called the logarithm to base ''a'', in chapter 6. In chapter 7, Euler introduces e as the number whose hyperbolic logarithm is 1. The reference here is to [[Gregoire de Saint-Vincent]] who performed a [[quadrature (mathematics)|quadrature]] of the hyperbola ''y'' = 1/''x'' through description of the hyperbolic logarithm. Section 122 labels the logarithm to base e the "natural or hyperbolic logarithm...since the quadrature of the hyperbola can be expressed through these logarithms".  Here he also gives the exponential series:
: &lt;math&gt;\exp(z) = \sum_{k = 0}^{\infty} {z^k \over k!} = 1 + z + {z^2 \over 2} + {z^3 \over 6} + {z^4 \over 24} + \cdots&lt;/math&gt;

Then in chapter 8 Euler is prepared to address the classical trigonometric functions as "transcendental quantities that arise from the circle." He uses the [[unit circle]] and presents [[Euler's formula]]. Chapter 9 considers trinomial factors in [[polynomial]]s. Chapter 16 is concerned with [[partition (number theory)|partition]]s, a topic in [[number theory]]. [[Continued fraction]]s are the topic of chapter 18.

In [[mathematics]], a '''leaky integrator''' equation is a specific [[differential equation]],  used to describe a component or system that takes the [[integral]] of an input, but gradually leaks a small amount of input over time. It appears commonly in [[hydraulics]], [[electronics]], and [[neuroscience]] where it can represent either a single neuron or a local population of neurons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Eliasmith, Anderson|first=Chris, Charles|title=Neural Engineering|year=2003|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|pages=81}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{Clarify|date=July 2009}}

This is equivalent to a 1st-order [[lowpass filter]] with cutoff frequency far below the frequencies of interest.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

==Equation==
The equation is of the form

:&lt;math&gt;dx/dt = -Ax + C&lt;/math&gt;

where C is the input and A is the [[Time constant|rate of the 'leak']].

===General solution===
As the equation is a nonhomogeneous  first-order [[linear differential equation]], its general solution is 

:&lt;math&gt;x(t) = ke^{-At} + x_0(t)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; is a constant, and &lt;math&gt;x_0&lt;/math&gt; is an arbitrary solution of the equation.

[[File:Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz c1700.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Gottfried Wilhelm von Leibniz]] (1646–1716), German philosopher, mathematician, and namesake of this widely used mathematical notation in calculus.]]

In [[calculus]], '''Leibniz's notation''', named in honor of the 17th-century German [[philosophy|philosopher]] and [[mathematics|mathematician]] [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]], uses the symbols {{math|''dx''}} and {{math|''dy''}} to represent infinitely small (or [[infinitesimal]]) increments of {{math|''x''}} and {{math|''y''}}, respectively, just as {{math|Δ''x''}} and {{math|Δ''y''}} represent finite increments of {{math|''x''}} and {{math|''y''}}, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Stewart | first=James | authorlink=James Stewart (mathematician) | title=Calculus: Early Transcendentals |publisher=[[Brooks/Cole]] | edition=6th | year=2008 | isbn=0-495-01166-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Consider {{math|''y''}} as a [[function (mathematics)|function]] of a variable {{math|''x''}}, or {{math|''y''}} = {{math|''f''(''x'')}}. If this is the case, then the [[derivative (mathematics)|derivative]] of {{math|''y''}} with respect to {{math|''x''}}, which later came to be viewed as the [[Limit (mathematics)|limit]]

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{\Delta x\rightarrow 0}\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x} = \lim_{\Delta x\rightarrow 0}\frac{f(x + \Delta x)-f(x)}{\Delta x},&lt;/math&gt;

was, according to Leibniz, the [[quotient]] of an infinitesimal increment of {{math|''y''}} by an infinitesimal increment of {{math|''x''}}, or

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dy}{dx}=f'(x),&lt;/math&gt;

where the right hand side is [[Notation for differentiation#Lagrange's notation|Joseph-Louis Lagrange's notation]] for the derivative of {{math|''f''}} at {{math|''x''}}.

Leibniz's concept of infinitesimals, long considered to be too imprecise to be used as a foundation of calculus, was eventually replaced by rigorous concepts developed by [[Weierstrass]] and others. Consequently, Leibniz's quotient notation was re-interpreted to stand for the limit of the modern definition. However, in many instances, the symbol did seem to act as an actual quotient would and its usefulness kept it popular even in the face of several competing notations. In the modern rigorous treatment of [[non-standard calculus]], justification can be found to again consider the notation as representing an actual quotient.

==History==

The Newton–Leibniz approach to [[infinitesimal calculus]] was introduced in the 17th century. While Newton worked with [[fluxion]]s and fluents, Leibniz based his approach on generalizations of sums and differences.&lt;ref name="Katz524"&gt;{{harvnb|Katz|1993|loc=p. 524}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leibniz was the first to use the &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \int&lt;/math&gt; character. He based the character on the Latin word ''summa'' ("sum"), which he wrote {{serif|''ſumma''}} with the [[long s|elongated s]] commonly used in Germany at the time. Viewing differences as the inverse operation of summation,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Katz|1993|loc=p. 529}}&lt;/ref&gt; he used the symbol {{mvar|d}}, the first letter of the Latin ''differentia'', to indicate this inverse operation.&lt;ref name="Katz524" /&gt; Leibniz was fastidious about notation; spending years experimenting, adjusting, rejecting and corresponding with other mathematicians about them.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mazur|2014|loc=p. 166}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notations he used for the differential of {{mvar|y}} ranged successively from {{mvar|ω}}, {{mvar|l}}, and {{math|{{sfrac|''y''|''d''}}}} until he finally settled on {{mvar|dy}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cajori|1993|loc=Vol. II, p. 203, footnote 4}}&lt;/ref&gt; His [[integral sign]] first appeared publicly in the article "De Geometria Recondita et analysi indivisibilium atque infinitorum" (On a hidden geometry and analysis of indivisibles and infinites), published in ''[[Acta Eruditorum]]'' in June 1686,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Frank J.|last=Swetz|title=Mathematical Treasure: Leibniz's Papers on Calculus - Integral Calculus|publisher=[[Mathematical Association of America]]|url=http://www.maa.org/press/periodicals/convergence/mathematical-treasure-leibnizs-papers-on-calculus-integral-calculus|accessdate=February 11, 2017|series=Convergence}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Mathematics and its History |first=John |last=Stillwell |authorlink=John Stillwell |publisher=Springer |year=1989 |page=110 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but he had been using it in private manuscripts at least since 1675.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Early Mathematical Manuscripts of Leibniz |first=G.

W., ''Sämtliche Schriften und Briefe, Reihe VII: Mathematische Schriften, vol. 5: Infinitesimalmathematik 1674-1676'', Berlin: Akademie Verlag, 2008, pp. [http://www.gwlb.de/Leibniz/Leibnizarchiv/Veroeffentlichungen/VII5B.pdf 321–331 esp. 328] ("Methodi tangentium inversae exempla", November 11, 1675).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cajori|1993|loc=Vol. II, p. 186}}&lt;/ref&gt; it does not appear in this form in either of the above-mentioned published works. Leibniz did, however, use forms such as {{mvar|dy ad dx}} and {{math|''dy'' : ''dx''}} in print.&lt;ref name="Cajori204" /&gt;

English mathematicians were encumbered by Newton's dot notation until 1803 when [[Robert Woodhouse]] published a description of the continental notation. Later the [[Analytical Society]] at [[Cambridge University]] promoted the adoption of Leibniz's notation.

At the end of the 19th century, Weierstrass's followers ceased to take Leibniz's notation for derivatives and integrals literally.  That is, mathematicians felt that the concept of [[infinitesimal]]s contained logical contradictions in its development. A number of 19th century mathematicians (Weierstrass and others) found logically rigorous ways to treat derivatives and integrals without infinitesimals using limits as shown above, while Cauchy exploited both infinitesimals and limits (see ''[[Cours d'Analyse]]''). Nonetheless, Leibniz's notation is still in general use. Although the notation need not be taken literally, it is usually simpler than alternatives when the technique of [[separation of variables]] is used in the solution of differential equations.  In physical applications, one may for example regard ''f''(''x'') as measured in meters per second, and d''x'' in seconds, so that ''f''(''x'') d''x'' is in meters, and so is the value of its definite integral. In that way the Leibniz notation is in harmony with [[dimensional analysis]].

==Leibniz's notation for differentiation==
Suppose a [[Dependent and independent variables#Mathematics|dependent variable]] {{math|''y''}} represents a function {{math|''f''}} of an independent variable {{math|''x''}}, that is,

:&lt;math&gt;y=f(x).&lt;/math&gt;

Then the derivative of the function {{math|''f''}}, in Leibniz's [[Mathematical notation|notation]] for [[derivative|differentiation]], can be written as

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dy}{dx}\,\text{ or }\frac{d}{dx}y\,\text{ or }\frac{d\bigl(f(x)\bigr)}{dx}.&lt;/math&gt;

The Leibniz expression, also, at times, written {{math|''dy''/''dx''}}, is one of several notations used for derivatives and derived functions. A common alternative is Lagrange's notation

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dy}{dx}\, = y' = f'(x).&lt;/math&gt;

Another alternative is [[Notation for differentiation#Newton's notation|Newton's notation]], often used for derivatives with respect to time (like [[velocity]]), which requires placing a dot over the dependent variable (in this case, {{math|''x''}}):

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dx}{dt} = \dot{x}.&lt;/math&gt;

Lagrange's "[[Prime (symbol)|prime]]" notation is especially useful in discussions of derived functions and has the advantage of having a natural way of denoting the value of the derived function at a specific value. However, the Leibniz notation has other virtues that have kept it popular through the years.

In its modern interpretation, the expression {{math|{{sfrac|''dy''|''dx''}}}} should not be read as the division of two quantities {{mvar|dx}} and {{mvar|dy}} (as Leibniz had envisioned it); rather, the whole expression should be seen as a single symbol that is shorthand for

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{\Delta x \to 0} \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}&lt;/math&gt;

(note {{math|Δ}} vs. {{mvar|d}}, where {{math|Δ}} indicates a finite difference).

The expression may also be thought of as the application of the [[differential operator]] {{math|{{sfrac|''d''|''dx''}}}} (again, a single symbol) to {{mvar|y}}, regarded as a function of {{mvar|x}}. This operator is written {{mvar|D}} in [[Notation for differentiation#Euler's notation|Euler's notation]]. Leibniz did not use this form, but his use of the symbol {{mvar|d}} corresponds fairly closely to this modern concept.

While there is no division implied by the notation, the division-like notation is useful since in many situations, the derivative operator does behave like a division, making some results about derivatives easy to obtain and remember.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=D. W. |last1=Jordan |first2=P. |last2=Smith |title=Mathematical Techniques: An Introduction for the Engineering, Physical, and Mathematical Sciences |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2002 |page=58}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This notation owes its longevity to the fact that it seems to reach to the very heart of the geometrical and mechanical applications of the calculus.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cajori|1993|loc=Vol. II, p. 262}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Leibniz notation for higher derivatives===

If {{math|1=''y'' = ''f''(''x'')}}, the {{mvar|n}}th derivative of {{mvar|f}} in Leibniz notation is given by,&lt;ref name="Briggs"&gt;{{harvnb|Briggs|Cochran|2010|loc=p. 141}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;f^{(n)}(x) = \frac{d^ny}{dx^n}.&lt;/math&gt;

This notation, for the [[second derivative]], is obtained by using {{math|{{sfrac|''d''|''dx''}}}} as an operator in the following way,&lt;ref name="Briggs"/&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d^2y}{dx^2} \,=\, \frac{d}{dx}\left(\frac{dy}{dx}\right).&lt;/math&gt;

A third derivative, which might be written as,

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d \left(\frac{d \left( \frac{dy}{dx}\right)}{dx}\right)}{dx}\,,&lt;/math&gt;

can be obtained from

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d^3y}{dx^3} \,=\, \frac{d}{dx}\left(\frac{d^2y}{dx^2}\right) \,=\, \frac{d}{dx}\left( \frac{d}{dx}\left(\frac{dy}{dx}\right)\right).&lt;/math&gt;

Similarly, the higher derivatives may be obtained inductively.
 
While it is possible, with carefully chosen definitions, to interpret {{math|{{sfrac|''dy''|''dx''}}}} as a quotient of [[Differential (mathematics)|differentials]], this should not be done with the higher order forms.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Swokowski|1983|loc=p. 135}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This notation was, however, not used by Leibniz. In print he did not use multi-tiered notation nor numerical exponents (before 1695). To write {{math|''x''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}} for instance, he would write {{mvar|xxx}}, as was common in his time. The square of a differential, as it might appear in an [[arc length]] formula for instance, was written as {{mvar|dxdx}}. However, Leibniz did use his {{mvar|d}} notation as we would today use operators, namely he would write a second derivative as {{mvar|ddy}} and a third derivative as {{mvar|dddy}}. In 1695 Leibniz started to write {{math|''d''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;⋅''x''}} and {{math|''d''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;⋅''x''}} for {{mvar|ddx}} and {{mvar|dddx}} respectively, but [[Guillaume de l'Hôpital|l'Hôpital]], in his textbook on calculus written around the same time, used Leibniz's original forms.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cajori|1993|loc=pp. 204-205}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Use in various formulas===
One reason that Leibniz's notations in calculus have endured so long is that they permit the easy recall of the appropriate formulas used for differentiation and integration. For instance, the [[chain rule]]—suppose that the function {{mvar|g}} is differentiable at {{mvar|x}} and {{math|1=''y'' = ''f''(''u'')}} is differentiable at {{math|1=''u'' = ''g''(''x'')}}. Then the composite function {{math|1=''y'' = ''f''(''g''(''x''))}} is differentiable at {{mvar|x}} and its derivative can be expressed in Leibniz notation as,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Briggs|Cochran|2010|loc=p. 176}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{dy}{du} \cdot \frac{du}{dx}.&lt;/math&gt;
This can be generalized to deal with the composites of several appropriately defined and related functions, {{math|''u''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''u''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''u''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}} and would be expressed as,

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{dy}{du_1} \cdot \frac{du_1}{du_2} \cdot \frac{du_2}{du_3}\cdots \frac{du_n}{dx}.&lt;/math&gt;

Also, the [[integration by substitution]] formula may be expressed by&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Swokowski|1983|loc=p. 257}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\int y \, dx = \int y \frac{dx}{du} \, du,&lt;/math&gt;

where {{mvar|x}} is thought of as a function of a new variable {{mvar|u}} and the function {{mvar|y}} on the left is expressed in terms of {{mvar|x}} while on the right it is expressed in terms of {{mvar|u}}.

If {{math|1=''y'' = ''f''(''x'')}} where {{mvar|f}} is a differentiable function that is [[Inverse function|invertible]], the derivative of the inverse function, when it exists, can be given by,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Swokowski|1983|loc=p. 369}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dx}{dy} = \frac{1}{\left( \frac{dy}{dx} \right)},&lt;/math&gt;
where the parentheses are added to emphasize the fact that the derivative is not a fraction.

One of the simplest types of [[differential equation]]s is&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Swokoski|1983|loc=p. 895}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
:&lt;math&gt;M(x) + N(y) \frac{dy}{dx} = 0,&lt;/math&gt;
where {{mvar|M}} and {{mvar|N}} are continuous functions. Solving (implicitly) such an equation can be done by examining the equation in its [[differential form]],
:&lt;math&gt;M(x) dx + N(y) dy = 0&lt;/math&gt;
and integrating to obtain
:&lt;math&gt;\int M(x) \, dx + \int N(y) \, dy = C.&lt;/math&gt;
Rewriting, when possible, a differential equation into this form and applying the above argument is known as the ''separation of variables'' technique for solving such equations.

In each of these instances the Leibniz notation for a derivative appears to act like a fraction, even though, in its modern interpretation, it isn't one.

==Modern justification==

In the 1960s, building upon earlier work by [[Edwin Hewitt]] and [[Jerzy Łoś]], [[Abraham Robinson]] developed mathematical explanations for Leibniz's infinitesimals that were acceptable by contemporary standards of rigor, and developed [[non-standard analysis]] based on these ideas. Robinson's methods are used by only a minority of mathematicians. [[Jerome Keisler]] wrote a first-year calculus textbook, ''[[Elementary calculus: an infinitesimal approach]]'', based on Robinson's approach.

From the point of view of modern infinitesimal theory, {{math|Δ''x''}} is an infinitesimal {{math|''x''}}-increment, {{math|Δ''y''}} is the corresponding {{math|''y''}}-increment, and the derivative is the [[standard part]] of the infinitesimal ratio:
:&lt;math&gt;f'(x)={\rm st}\Bigg( \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x} \Bigg)&lt;/math&gt;.
Then one sets &lt;math&gt;dx=\Delta x&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;dy = f'(x) dx&lt;/math&gt;, so that by definition, &lt;math&gt;f'(x)&lt;/math&gt; is the ratio of {{math|''dy''}} by {{math|''dx''}}.

Similarly, although most mathematicians now view an integral

:&lt;math&gt;\int f(x)\,dx&lt;/math&gt;

as a limit

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{\Delta x\rightarrow 0}\sum_{i} f(x_i)\,\Delta x,&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|Δ''x''}} is an interval containing {{math|''x''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}}, Leibniz viewed it as the sum (the integral sign denoted summation for him) of infinitely many infinitesimal quantities {{math|''f''(''x'')&amp;nbsp;''dx''}}.  From the viewpoint of nonstandard analysis, it is correct to view the integral as the standard part of such an infinite sum.

The trade-off needed to gain the precision of these concepts is that the set of [[real number]]s must be extended to the set of [[hyperreal number]]s.

==Other notations of Leibniz==

Leibniz experimented with many different notations in various areas of mathematics. He felt that good notation was fundamental in the pursuit of mathematics. In a letter to l'Hôpital in 1693 he says:&lt;ref name="Cajori185"&gt;{{harvnb|Cajori|1993|loc=Vol. II, p. 185}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|One of the secrets of analysis consists in the characteristic, that is, in the art of skilful employment of the available signs, and you will observe, Sir, by the small enclosure [on determinants] that Vieta and Descartes have not known all the mysteries.}} He refined his criteria for good notation over time and came to realize the value of "adopting symbolisms which could be set up in a line like ordinary type, without the need of widening the spaces between lines to make room for symbols with sprawling parts."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Carjori|1993|loc=Vol. II, p. 184}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, in his early works he heavily used a [[vinculum (symbol)|vinculum]] to indicate grouping of symbols, but later he introduced the idea of using pairs of parentheses for this purpose, thus appeasing the typesetters who no longer had to widen the spaces between lines on a page and making the pages look more attractive.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mazur|2014|loc=pp. 167-168}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the over 200 new symbols introduced by Leibniz are still in use today.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mazur|2014|loc=p. 167}}&lt;/ref&gt; Besides the differentials {{mvar|dx}}, {{mvar|dy}} and the integral sign ( ∫ ) already mentioned, he also introduced the colon (:) for division, the dot (⋅) for multiplication, the geometric signs for similar (~) and congruence (≅), the use of [[Robert Recorde|Recorde's]] equal sign (=) for proportions (replacing [[William Oughtred|Oughtred's]] '''::''' notation) and the double-suffix notation for determinants.&lt;ref name="Cajori185" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5673">In [[mathematics]], in particular [[linear algebra]], the '''matrix determinant lemma'''&lt;ref name="harville"&gt;{{cite book | author = Harville, D. A. | year = 1997 | title = Matrix Algebra From a Statistician’s Perspective | publisher = Springer-Verlag | isbn= | doi = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="brookes"&gt;{{cite web | author = Brookes, M. | title = The Matrix Reference Manual (online) | url = http://www.ee.ic.ac.uk/hp/staff/dmb/matrix/intro.html | year = 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; computes the [[determinant]] of the sum of an [[inverse matrix|invertible]] [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] '''A''' and the [[dyadic product]], '''u{{thinsp}}v'''&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt;, of a column [[vector (mathematics)|vector]] '''u''' and a row vector '''v'''&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt;.  

== Statement ==
Suppose '''A''' is an [[invertible]] [[square matrix]] and '''u''', '''v''' are column [[Vector (geometric)|vectors]]. Then the matrix determinant lemma states that
:&lt;math&gt;\det\left(\mathbf{A} + \mathbf{uv}^\textsf{T}\right) = \left(1 + \mathbf{v}^\textsf{T}\mathbf{A}^{-1}\mathbf{u}\right)\,\det\left(\mathbf{A}\right)\,.&lt;/math&gt;

Here, '''uv'''&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt; is the [[outer product]] of two vectors '''u''' and '''v'''.

The theorem can also be stated in terms of the [[adjugate matrix]] of '''A''':
:&lt;math&gt;\det\left(\mathbf{A} + \mathbf{uv}^\textsf{T}\right) = \det\left(\mathbf{A}\right) + \mathbf{v}^\textsf{T}\mathrm{adj}\left(\mathbf{A}\right)\mathbf{u}\,,&lt;/math&gt;

in which case it applies whether or not the square matrix '''A''' is invertible.

== Proof ==
First the proof of the special case '''A''' = '''I''' follows from the equality:&lt;ref name="ding"&gt;{{cite journal | 
authors = Ding, J., Zhou, A. | year =  2007 | 
title = Eigenvalues of rank-one updated matrices with some applications | 
journal = Applied Mathematics Letters | volume = 20 | issue = 12 | pages = 1223–1226 | issn = 0893-9659 | 
doi = 10.1016/j.aml.2006.11.016 | 
url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/B6TY9-4N3P02W-5/2/b7f582211325150af4c44674b5e06dd1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
  \begin{pmatrix} \mathbf{I} &amp; 0 \\ \mathbf{v}^\textsf{T} &amp; 1 \end{pmatrix}
  \begin{pmatrix} \mathbf{I} + \mathbf{uv}^\textsf{T} &amp; \mathbf{u} \\ 0 &amp; 1 \end{pmatrix}
  \begin{pmatrix} \mathbf{I} &amp; 0 \\ -\mathbf{v}^\textsf{T} &amp; 1 \end{pmatrix} =
  \begin{pmatrix} \mathbf{I} &amp; \mathbf{u} \\ 0 &amp; 1 + \mathbf{v}^\textsf{T}\mathbf{u} \end{pmatrix}.
&lt;/math&gt;

The determinant of the left hand side is the product of the determinants of the three matrices.  Since the first and third matrix are triangle matrices with unit diagonal, their determinants are just 1.  The determinant of the middle matrix is our desired value.  The determinant of the right hand side is simply (1 + '''v'''&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt;'''u''').  So we have the result:

:&lt;math&gt;\det\left(\mathbf{I} + \mathbf{uv}^\textsf{T}\right) = \left(1 + \mathbf{v}^\textsf{T}\mathbf{u}\right).&lt;/math&gt;

Then the general case can be found as:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  \det\left(\mathbf{A} + \mathbf{uv}^\textsf{T}\right)
    &amp;= \det\left(\mathbf{A}\right) \det\left(\mathbf{I} + \left(\mathbf{A}^{-1}\mathbf{u}\right)\mathbf{v}^\textsf{T}\right)\\
    &amp;= \det\left(\mathbf{A}\right) \left(1 + \mathbf{v}^\textsf{T} \left(\mathbf{A}^{-1}\mathbf{u}\right)\right).
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

==Application==

If the determinant and inverse of '''A''' are already known, the formula provides a [[computationally expensive|numerically cheap]] way to compute the determinant of '''A''' corrected by the matrix '''uv'''&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt;. The computation is relatively cheap because the determinant of '''A''' + '''uv'''&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt; does not have to be computed from scratch (which in general is expensive). Using [[unit vectors]] for '''u''' and/or '''v''', individual columns, rows or elements&lt;ref name="press"&gt;{{cite book | authors = William H. Press, Brian P. Flannery, Saul A. Teukolsky, William T. Vetterling | title = [[Numerical Recipes|Numerical Recipes in C: The Art of Scientific Computing]] | pages = 73 | publisher = Cambridge University Press | year = 1992 | isbn = 0-521-43108-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; of '''A''' may be manipulated and a correspondingly updated determinant computed relatively cheaply in this way. 

When the matrix determinant lemma is used in conjunction with the [[Sherman-Morrison formula]], both the inverse and determinant may be conveniently updated together.

== Generalization ==
Suppose '''A''' is an [[invertible]] ''n''-by-''n'' matrix and '''U''', '''V''' are ''n''-by-''m'' matrices. Then
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{det}\left(\mathbf{A} + \mathbf{UV}^\textsf{T}\right) = \operatorname{det}\left(\mathbf{I_m} + \mathbf{V}^\textsf{T}\mathbf{A}^{-1}\mathbf{U}\right)\operatorname{det}(\mathbf{A}).&lt;/math&gt; 

In the special case &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}=\mathbf{I_n}&lt;/math&gt; this is [[Sylvester's determinant theorem|Sylvester's theorem for determinants]].

Given additionally an invertible ''m''-by-''m'' matrix '''W''', the relationship can also be expressed as
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{det}\left(\mathbf{A} + \mathbf{UWV}^\textsf{T}\right) = \det\left(\mathbf{W}^{-1} + \mathbf{V}^\textsf{T}\mathbf{A}^{-1}\mathbf{U}\right)\det\left(\mathbf{W}\right)\det\left(\mathbf{A}\right).&lt;/math&gt;

==Definition==
The meshedness coefficient is used to compare the general cycle structure of a connected planar graph to two extreme relevant references. In one end, there are [[Tree (graph theory)|trees]], planar graphs with no cycle.&lt;ref name="first"/&gt; The other extreme is represented by [[maximal planar graph]]s, planar graphs with the highest possible number of edges and faces for a given number of vertices. The normalized meshedness coefficient is the ratio of available face cycles to the maximum possible number of face cycles in the graph. This ratio is 0 for a tree and 1 for any maximal planar graph.

More generally, it can be shown using the [[Euler characteristic]] that all ''n''-vertex planar graphs have at most 2''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;5 bounded faces (not counting the one unbounded face)
and that if there are ''m'' edges then the number of bounded faces is ''m''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1 (the same as the [[circuit rank]] of the graph).
Therefore, a normalized meshedness coefficient can be defined as the ratio of these two numbers:
:&lt;math&gt;\alpha = \frac{m-n+1}{2n-5}.&lt;/math&gt;
It varies from 0 for trees to 1 for maximal planar graphs.

==Applications==
The meshedness coefficient can be used to estimate the redundancy of a network. This parameter along with the [[algebraic connectivity]] which measures the robustness of the network, may be used to quantify the topological aspect of network resilience in water distribution networks.&lt;ref name=Third&gt;

==Limitations==

Using the definition of the average degree &lt;math&gt;\langle k\rangle = 2m/n &lt;/math&gt;, one can see that in the limit of large graphs (number of edges {{nowrap|1=&lt;math&gt;n \gg 1&lt;/math&gt;)}} the meshedness tends to
:&lt;math&gt;\alpha \approx \frac{\langle k\rangle}{4} - \frac{1}{2}&lt;/math&gt;
Thus, for large graphs, the meshedness does not carry more information than the average degree.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1587">In [[number theory]] and [[combinatorics]], a '''multipartition''' of a positive [[integer]] ''n'' is a way of writing ''n'' as a [[summation|sum]], each element of which is in turn a [[Partition (number theory)|partition]].  The concept is also found in the theory of [[Lie algebra]]s.

==r-component multipartitions==
An ''r''-component multipartition of an integer ''n'' is an ''r''-tuple of partitions λ&lt;sup&gt;(1)&lt;/sup&gt;,...,λ&lt;sup&gt;(r)&lt;/sup&gt; where each λ&lt;sup&gt;(''i'')&lt;/sup&gt; is a partition of some ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; and the  ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; sum to ''n''.  The number of ''r''-component multipartitions of ''n'' is denoted ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt;(''n'').  Congruences for the function ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt;(''n'') have been studied by [[A. O. L. Atkin]].

[[File:Opticks.jpg|thumb|The first, 1704, edition of ''Opticks: or, a treatise of the reflexions, refractions, inflexions and colours of light.'']]
'''''Opticks: or, A Treatise of the Reflexions, Refractions, Inflexions and Colours of Light''''' is a book by [[English people|English]] natural philosopher [[Isaac Newton]] that was published in [[English language|English]] in 1704.&lt;ref name=Opticks&gt;{{cite book|last=Newton|first=Isaac|author-link=Isaac Newton |title=Opticks: or, a treatise of the reflexions, refractions, inflexions and colours of light. Also two treatises of the species and magnitude of curvilinear figures.|date=1998|publisher=Octavo|location=Palo Alto, Calif.|isbn=1-891788-04-3|edition=Octavo |others=Commentary by Nicholas Humez}} (''Opticks'' was originally published in 1704).&lt;/ref&gt; (A scholarly [[Latin]] translation appeared in 1706.) The book analyzes the fundamental nature of light by means of the [[refraction]] of light with prisms and lenses, the [[diffraction]] of light by closely spaced sheets of glass, and the behaviour of color mixtures with spectral lights or [[pigment]] powders. It is considered one of the great works of science in history. ''Opticks'' was Newton's second major book on [[physical science]]. Newton's name did not appear on the title page of the first edition of ''Opticks''.

==Overview==
The publication of ''Opticks'' represented a major contribution to science, different from but in some ways rivalling the ''[[Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica|Principia]]''. ''Opticks'' is largely a record of experiments and the [[Deductive reasoning|deduction]]s made from them, covering a wide range of topics in what was later to be known as [[physical optics]].&lt;ref name=Opticks/&gt; That is, this work is not a [[geometry|geometric]] discussion of [[catoptrics]] or [[dioptrics]], the traditional subjects of [[Reflection (physics)|reflection]] of light by [[mirror]]s of different shapes and the exploration of how light is "bent" as it passes from one [[medium (optics)|medium]], such as air, into another, such as water or glass. Rather, the ''Opticks'' is a study of the nature of light and colour and the various phenomena of [[diffraction]], which Newton called the "inflexion" of light.

In this book Newton sets forth in full his experiments, first reported to the Royal Society of London in 1672,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Newton|first=Isaac|title=Hydrostatics, Optics, Sound and Heat|url=http://cudl.lib.cam.ac.uk/view/MS-ADD-03970/|accessdate=10 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; on [[Dispersion (optics)|dispersion]], or the separation of light into a [[spectrum]] of its component colours. He demonstrates how the appearance of color arises from selective [[Absorption (optics)|absorption]], reflection, or [[Transmittance|transmission]] of the various component parts of the incident light.

The major significance of Newton's work is that it overturned the dogma, attributed to [[Aristotle]] or [[Theophrastus]] and accepted by scholars in Newton's time, that "pure" light (such as the light attributed to the Sun) is fundamentally white or colourless, and is altered into color by mixture with darkness caused by interactions with matter. Newton showed just the opposite was true: light is composed of different spectral hues (he describes seven — red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo and violet), and all colours, including white, are formed by various mixtures of these hues. He demonstrates that color arises from a physical property of light — each hue is refracted at a characteristic angle by a prism or lens — but he clearly states that color is a sensation within the mind and not an inherent property of material objects or of light itself. For example, he demonstrates that a red violet (magenta) color can be mixed by overlapping the red and violet ends of two spectra, although this color does not appear in the spectrum and therefore is not a "color of light". By connecting the red and violet ends of the spectrum, he organised all colours as a [[color circle]] that both quantitatively predicts color mixtures and qualitatively describes the perceived similarity among hues.

Newton's visionary contribution to prismatic dispersion was the first to outlined multiple-prism arrays. Multiple-prism configurations, as beam expanders, became central to the design of the tunable laser more than 275 years later and set the stage for the development of the [[multiple-prism dispersion theory]].&lt;ref&gt;[[F. J. Duarte]] and J. A. Piper, Dispersion theory of multiple-prism beam expanders for pulsed dye lasers, ''Opt. Commun.'' '''43''', 303–307 (1982).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;P. Rowlands, &lt;i&gt;Newton and Modern Physics&lt;/i&gt; (World Scientific, London, 2017).&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Opticks'' and the ''Principia''==
''Opticks'' differs in many respects from the ''Principia''. It was first published in English rather than in the [[Latin]] used by European philosophers, contributing to the development of a vernacular science literature. This marks a significant transition in the history of the English Language. With Britain's growing confidence and world influence, due at least in part to people like Newton, the English language was rapidly becoming the language of science and business. The book is a model of popular science exposition: although Newton's English is somewhat dated—he shows a fondness for lengthy sentences with much embedded qualifications—the book can still be easily understood by a modern reader. In contrast, few readers of Newton's time found the ''Principia'' accessible or even comprehensible. His formal but flexible style shows colloquialisms and metaphorical word choice.

Unlike the ''Principia'', ''Opticks'' is not developed using the geometric convention of [[proposition]]s proved by deduction from either previous propositions, [[Lemma (mathematics)|lemma]]s or [[first principle]]s (or [[axiom]]s). Instead, axioms define the meaning of technical terms or fundamental properties of matter and light, and the stated propositions are demonstrated by means of specific, carefully described experiments. The first sentence of the book declares ''My Design in this Book is not to explain the Properties of Light by Hypotheses, but to propose and prove them by Reason and Experiments.'' In an ''[[Experimentum crucis]]'' or "critical experiment" (Book I, Part II, Theorem ii), Newton showed that the color of light corresponded to its "degree of refrangibility" (angle of refraction), and that this angle cannot be changed by additional reflection or refraction or by passing the light through a coloured filter.

The work is a ''[[vade mecum]]'' of the experimenter's art, displaying in many examples how to use observation to propose factual generalisations about the physical world and then exclude competing explanations by specific experimental tests. However, unlike the ''Principia'', which vowed ''Non fingo hypotheses'' or "I make no hypotheses" outside the deductive method, the ''Opticks'' develops conjectures about light that go beyond the experimental evidence: for example, that the physical behaviour of light was due its [[Corpuscular theory of light|"corpuscular" nature as small particles]], or that perceived colours were harmonically proportioned like the tones of a diatonic musical scale.

==The Queries==
:''See main: [[The Queries]]''
''Opticks'' concludes with a set of "Queries." In the first edition, these were sixteen such Queries; that number was increased in the Latin edition, published in 1706, and then in the revised English edition, published in 1717/18. The first set of Queries were brief, but the later ones became short essays, filling many pages. In the fourth edition of 1730, there were 31 Queries, and it was the famous "31st Query" that, over the next two hundred years, stimulated a great deal of speculation and development on theories of [[chemical affinity]].

These Queries, especially the later ones, deal with a wide range of physical phenomena, far transcending any narrow interpretation of the subject matter of "optics." They concern the nature and transmission of heat; the possible cause of gravity; electrical phenomena; the nature of [[chemical reaction|chemical action]]; the way in which God created matter in "the Beginning;" the proper way to do science; and even the [[ethics|ethical]] conduct of human beings. These Queries are not really questions in the ordinary sense. They are almost all posed in the negative, as [[rhetorical question]]s. That is, Newton does not ask whether light "is" or "may be" a "body." Rather, he declares: "Is not Light a Body?" Not only does this form indicate that Newton had an answer, but that it may go on for many pages. Clearly, as [[Stephen Hales]] (a firm Newtonian of the early eighteenth century) declared, this was Newton's mode of explaining "by Query."

==Multiverse==
Newton suggests the idea of a [[multiverse]] in this passage:&lt;blockquote&gt;And since Space is divisible in infinitum, and Matter is not necessarily in all places, it may be also allow'd that God is able to create Particles of Matter of several Sizes and Figures, and in several Proportions to Space, and perhaps of different Densities and Forces, and thereby to vary the Laws of Nature, and make Worlds of several sorts in several Parts of the Universe. At least, I see nothing of Contradiction in all this.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.gutenberg.org/files/33504/33504-h/33504-h.htm pp 403-404&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Reception==
The ''Opticks'' was widely read and debated in England and on the Continent. The early presentation of the work to the Royal Society stimulated a bitter dispute between Newton and [[Robert Hooke]] over the [[Corpuscular theory of light|"corpuscular" or particle theory of light]], which prompted Newton to postpone publication of the work until after Hooke's death in 1703. On the Continent, and in France in particular, both the ''Principia'' and the ''Opticks'' were initially rejected by many natural philosophers, who continued to defend Cartesian natural philosophy and the Aristotelian version of color, and claimed to find Newton's prism experiments difficult to replicate. Indeed, the Aristotelian theory of the fundamental nature of white light was defended into the 19th century, for example by the German writer [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]] in his ''Farbenlehre''.

Newtonian science became a central issue in the assault waged by the [[philosophes]] in the [[Age of Enlightenment]] against a [[natural philosophy]] based on the authority of ancient Greek or Roman naturalists or on deductive reasoning from first principles (the method advocated by French philosopher [[René Descartes]]), rather than on the application of mathematical reasoning to experience or experiment. [[Voltaire]] popularised Newtonian science, including the content of both the ''Principia'' and the ''Opticks'', in his ''Elements de la philosophie de Newton'' (1738), and after about 1750 the combination of the experimental methods exemplified by the ''Opticks'' and the mathematical methods exemplified by the ''Principia'' were established as a unified and comprehensive model of [[Newtonianism|Newtonian]] science. Some of the primary adepts in this new philosophy were such prominent figures as [[Benjamin Franklin]], [[Antoine-Laurent Lavoisier]], and [[James Black (scientist)|James Black]].

Subsequent to Newton, much has been amended. Young and Fresnel combined Newton's particle theory with Huygens' wave theory to show that colour is the visible manifestation of light's wavelength. Science also slowly came to realise the difference between perception of colour and mathematisable optics. The German poet Goethe, with his epic diatribe ''[[Theory of Colours]]'', could not shake the Newtonian foundation - but "one hole Goethe did find in Newton's armour.. Newton had committed himself to the doctrine that refraction without colour was impossible. He therefore thought that the object-glasses of telescopes must for ever remain imperfect, achromatism and refraction being incompatible. This inference was proved by [[John Dollond|
Dollond]] to be wrong." (John Tyndall, 1880&lt;ref&gt;Popular Science Monthly/Volume 17/July 1880)http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Popular_Science_Monthly/Volume_17/July_1880/Goethe's_Farbenlehre:_Theory_of_Colors_II&lt;/ref&gt;)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6408">In the [[mathematics|mathematical]] field of [[order theory]] an '''order isomorphism''' is a special kind of [[monotone function]] that constitutes a suitable notion of [[isomorphism]] for [[partially ordered set]]s (posets). Whenever two posets are order isomorphic, they can be considered to be "essentially the same" in the sense that one of the orders can be obtained from the other just by renaming of elements. Two strictly weaker notions that relate to order isomorphisms are [[order embedding]]s and [[Galois connection]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Bloch|2011}}; {{harvtxt|Ciesielski|1997}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
Formally, given two [[Partially ordered set|posets]] &lt;math&gt;(S,\le_S)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(T,\le_T)&lt;/math&gt;, an '''order isomorphism'''  from &lt;math&gt;(S,\le_S)&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;(T,\le_T)&lt;/math&gt; is a [[bijection|bijective function]] &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; from &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; with the property that, for every &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;x \le_S y&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;f(x)\le_T f(y)&lt;/math&gt;. That is, it is a bijective [[order-embedding]].&lt;ref&gt;This is the definition used by {{harvtxt|Ciesielski|1997}}. For {{harvtxt|Bloch|2011}} and {{harvtxt|Schröder|2003}} it is a consequence of a different definition.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also possible to define an order isomorphism to be a [[surjective]] order-embedding. The two assumptions that &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; cover all the elements of &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; and that it preserve orderings, are enough to ensure that &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is also one-to-one, for if &lt;math&gt;f(x)=f(y)&lt;/math&gt; then (by the assumption that &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; preserves the order) it would follow that &lt;math&gt;x\le y&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y\le x&lt;/math&gt;, implying by the definition of a partial order that &lt;math&gt;x=y&lt;/math&gt;.

Yet another characterization of order isomorphisms is that they are exactly the [[monotone function|monotone]] [[bijection]]s that have a monotone inverse.&lt;ref&gt;This is the definition used by {{harvtxt|Bloch|2011}} and {{harvtxt|Schröder|2003}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

An order isomorphism from a partially ordered set to itself is called an '''order [[automorphism]]'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Schröder|2003}}, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

When an additional algebraic structure is imposed on the posets &lt;math&gt;(S,\le_S)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(T,\le_T)&lt;/math&gt;, a function from &lt;math&gt;(S,\le_S)&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;(T,\le_T)&lt;/math&gt; must satisfy additional properties to be regarded as an isomorphism. For example, given two [[partially ordered group]]s (po-groups) &lt;math&gt;(G, \le_G)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(H, \le_H)&lt;/math&gt;, an '''isomorphism of po-groups''' from &lt;math&gt;(G,\leq_G)&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;(H,\le_H)&lt;/math&gt; is an order isomorphism that is also a [[group isomorphism]], not merely a bijection that is an [[order embedding]].&lt;ref&gt;This definition is equivalent to the definition set forth in {{harvtxt|Fuchs|1963}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
* The [[identity function]] on any partially ordered set is always an order automorphism.
* [[Additive inverse|Negation]] is an order isomorphism from &lt;math&gt;(\mathbb{R},\leq)&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;(\mathbb{R},\geq)&lt;/math&gt; (where &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; is the set of [[real number]]s and &lt;math&gt;\le&lt;/math&gt; denotes the usual numerical comparison), since −''x'' ≥ −''y'' if and only if ''x'' ≤ ''y''.&lt;ref&gt;See example 4 of {{harvtxt|Ciesielski|1997}}, p. 39., for a similar example with integers in place of real numbers.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[open interval]] &lt;math&gt;(0,1)&lt;/math&gt; (again, ordered numerically) does not have an order isomorphism to or from the [[closed interval]] &lt;math&gt;[0,1]&lt;/math&gt;: the closed interval has a least element, but the open interval does not, and order isomorphisms must preserve the existence of least elements.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Ciesielski|1997}}, example 1, p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Order types==
If &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is an order isomorphism, then so is its [[inverse function]].
Also, if &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is an order isomorphism from &lt;math&gt;(S,\le_S)&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;(T,\le_T)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; is an order isomorphism from &lt;math&gt;(T,\le_T)&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;(U,\le_U)&lt;/math&gt;, then the [[function composition]] of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; is itself an order isomorphism, from &lt;math&gt;(S,\le_S)&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;(U,\le_U)&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Ciesielski|1997}}; {{harvtxt|Schröder|2003}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Two partially ordered sets are said to be '''order isomorphic''' when there exists an order isomorphism from one to the other.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Ciesielski|1997}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Identity functions, function inverses, and compositions of functions correspond, respectively, to the three defining characteristics of an [[equivalence relation]]: [[reflexive relation|reflexivity]], [[symmetric relation|symmetry]], and [[transitive relation|transitivity]]. Therefore, order isomorphism is an equivalence relation. The class of partially ordered sets can be partitioned by it into [[equivalence class]]es, families of partially ordered sets that are all isomorphic to each other. These equivalence classes are called [[order type]]s.

'''Parallax''' ({{etymology|grc|''παράλλαξις'' (parallaxis)|alternation}}) is a displacement or difference in the [[apparent position]] of an object viewed along two different [[sightline|lines of sight]], and is measured by the angle or semi-angle of inclination between those two lines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite dictionary | quote=Mutual inclination of two lines meeting in an angle | encyclopedia=Shorter Oxford English Dictionary | date=1968}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=oed&gt;{{cite dictionary | encyclopedia=Oxford English Dictionary | date=1989 | edition=Second | title=Parallax | quote=''Astron.'' Apparent displacement, or difference in the apparent position, of an object, caused by actual change (or difference) of position of the point of observation; spec. the angular amount of such displacement or difference of position, being the angle contained between the two straight lines drawn to the object from the two different points of view, and constituting a measure of the distance of the object. | url=http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50171114?single=1&amp;query_type=word&amp;queryword=parallax&amp;first=1&amp;max_to_show=10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to [[perspective (graphical)|foreshortening]], nearby objects show a larger parallax than farther objects when observed from different positions, so parallax can be used to determine distances.

To measure large distances, such as the distance of a planet or a [[star]] from [[Earth]], astronomers use the principle of parallax. Here, the term ''parallax'' is the semi-angle of inclination between two sight-lines to the star, as observed when Earth is on opposite sides of the Sun in its orbit.&lt;ref&gt;In the past [[#Diurnal parallax|diurnal parallax]] was also used to measure distances to celestial objects within the [[Solar System]]. This method has now been superseded by more accurate techniques.&lt;/ref&gt; These distances form the lowest rung of what is called "the [[cosmic distance ladder]]", the first in a succession of methods by which astronomers determine the distances to celestial objects, serving as a basis for other distance measurements in astronomy forming the higher rungs of the ladder.

Parallax also affects optical instruments such as rifle scopes, [[binoculars]], [[microscope]]s, and [[twin-lens reflex camera]]s that view objects from slightly different angles. Many animals, including humans, have two [[human eye|eye]]s with overlapping [[visual perception|visual fields]] that use parallax to gain [[depth perception]]; this process is known as [[stereopsis]]. In [[computer vision]] the effect is used for [[computer stereo vision]], and there is a device called a [[Coincidence rangefinder|parallax rangefinder]] that uses it to find range, and in some variations also altitude to a target.

A simple everyday example of parallax can be seen in the dashboard of motor vehicles that use a needle-style speedometer gauge. When viewed from directly in front, the speed may show exactly 60; but when viewed from the passenger seat the needle may appear to show a slightly different speed, due to the angle of viewing.

== Visual perception ==
{{main|stereopsis|depth perception|binocular vision|Binocular disparity}}
As the eyes of humans and other animals are in different positions on the head, they present different views simultaneously. This is the basis of [[stereopsis]], the process by which the brain exploits the parallax due to the different views from the eye to gain depth perception and estimate distances to objects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last=Steinman | first=Scott B. | last2=Garzia | first2=Ralph Philip | date=2000 | title=Foundations of Binocular Vision: A Clinical perspective |  publisher=McGraw-Hill Professional | isbn=0-8385-2670-5 | pages=2–5 | ref=harv | postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Animals also use ''motion parallax'', in which the animals (or just the head) move to gain different viewpoints. For example, [[pigeon]]s (whose eyes do not have overlapping fields of view and thus cannot use stereopsis) bob their heads up and down to see depth.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Steinman|Garzia|2000|loc=p. 180}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The motion parallax is exploited also in [[wiggle stereoscopy]], computer graphics which provide depth cues through viewpoint-shifting animation rather than through binocular vision.

== Astronomy ==
[[File:Parallax geo or helio static.PNG|thumb|300px|Parallax is an angle subtended by a line on a point. In the upper diagram, the earth in its orbit sweeps the parallax angle subtended on the sun. The lower diagram shows an equal angle swept by the sun in a geostatic model. A similar diagram can be drawn for a star except that the angle of parallax would be minuscule.]]

Parallax arises due to change in viewpoint occurring due to motion of the observer, of the observed, or of both. What is essential is relative motion. By observing parallax, [[measurement|measuring]] [[angle]]s, and using [[geometry]], one can determine [[distance]]. Astronomers also use the word "parallax" as a synonym for "distance measurement" by other methods: see [[parallax (disambiguation)#Astronomy]].

=== Stellar parallax ===
{{main|Stellar parallax}}

Stellar parallax created by the relative motion between the Earth and a [[star]] can be seen, in the Copernican model, as arising from the orbit of the Earth around the Sun: the star only ''appears'' to move relative to more distant objects in the sky. In a geostatic model, the movement of the star would have to be taken as ''real'' with the star oscillating across the sky with respect to the background stars.

Stellar parallax is most often measured using '''annual parallax''', defined as the difference in position of a star as seen from the Earth and Sun, i.&amp;nbsp;e. the angle subtended at a star by the mean radius of the Earth's orbit around the Sun. The [[parsec]] (3.26 [[light-year]]s) is defined as the distance for which the annual parallax is 1&amp;nbsp;[[arcsecond]]. Annual parallax is normally measured by observing the position of a star at different times of the [[year]] as the Earth moves through its orbit. Measurement of annual parallax was the first reliable way to determine the distances to the closest stars. The first successful measurements of stellar parallax were made by [[Friedrich Bessel]] in 1838 for the star [[61 Cygni|61&amp;nbsp;Cygni]] using a [[heliometer]].&lt;ref name=ZG44&gt;{{harvnb|Zeilik|Gregory|1998 | loc=p. 44}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Stellar parallax remains the standard for calibrating other measurement methods. Accurate calculations of distance based on stellar parallax require a measurement of the distance from the Earth to the Sun, now based on [[radar]] reflection off the surfaces of planets.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Zeilik|Gregory|1998|loc=&amp;sect; 22-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The angles involved in these calculations are very small and thus difficult to measure. The nearest star to the Sun (and thus the star with the largest parallax), [[Proxima Centauri]], has a parallax of 0.7687&amp;nbsp;±&amp;nbsp;0.0003&amp;nbsp;arcsec.&lt;ref name="apj118"&gt;{{cite journal

The fact that stellar parallax was so small that it was unobservable at the time was used as the main scientific argument against [[heliocentrism]] during the early modern age. It is clear from [[Euclid]]'s [[geometry]] that the effect would be undetectable if the stars were far enough away, but for various reasons such gigantic distances involved seemed entirely implausible: it was one of [[Tycho Brahe|Tycho]]'s principal objections to [[Copernican heliocentrism]] that in order for it to be compatible with the lack of observable stellar parallax, there would have to be an enormous and unlikely void between the orbit of [[Saturn]] (then the most distant known planet) and the eighth [[Celestial sphere|sphere]] (the fixed stars).&lt;ref&gt;See p.51 in ''The reception of Copernicus' heliocentric theory: proceedings of a symposium organized by the Nicolas Copernicus Committee of the International Union of the History and Philosophy of Science'', Torun, Poland, 1973, ed.

In 1989, the satellite [[Hipparcos]] was launched primarily for obtaining improved parallaxes and [[proper motion]]s for over 100,000 nearby stars, increasing the reach of the method tenfold. Even so, Hipparcos is only able to measure parallax angles for stars up to about 1,600 [[light-year]]s away, a little more than one percent of the diameter of the [[Milky Way Galaxy]]. The [[European Space Agency]]'s [[Gaia mission]], launched in December 2013, will be able to measure parallax angles to an accuracy of 10 [[microarcsecond]]s, thus mapping nearby stars (and potentially planets) up to a distance of tens of thousands of light-years from Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Soyuz ST-B successfully launches Gaia space observatory|url=http://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2013/12/soyuz-stb-launch-gaia-space-observatory/|publisher=nasaspaceflight.com|accessdate=19 December 2013|date=19 December 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131219190327/http://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2013/12/soyuz-stb-launch-gaia-space-observatory/|archivedate=19 December 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Henney | first = Paul J. | title = ESA's Gaia Mission to study stars | publisher = Astronomy Today | date =  | url = http://www.astronomytoday.com/exploration/gaia.html | accessdate = 2008-03-08 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080317052211/http://www.astronomytoday.com/exploration/gaia.html | archivedate = 2008-03-17 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2014, NASA astronomers reported that the [[Hubble Space Telescope]], by using [[Parallax#Parallax in astronomy|spatial scanning]], can now precisely measure distances up to 10,000 light-years away, a ten-fold improvement over earlier measurements.&lt;ref name="NASA-20140410"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Harrington |first1=J.D. |last2=Villard |first2=Ray |title=NASA's Hubble Extends Stellar Tape Measure 10 Times Farther Into Space |url=http://www.nasa.gov/press/2014/april/nasas-hubble-extends-stellar-tape-measure-10-times-farther-into-space |date=10 April 2014 |work=[[NASA]] |accessdate=11 April 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140412235329/http://www.nasa.gov/press/2014/april/nasas-hubble-extends-stellar-tape-measure-10-times-farther-into-space/ |archivedate=12 April 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Distance measurement ===
{{main|Distance measurement}}
[[File:Stellarparallax2.svg|thumb|175px|right|[[Stellar parallax]] motion]]

Distance measurement by parallax is a special case of the principle of [[triangulation]], which states that one can solve for all the sides and angles in a network of triangles if, in addition to all the angles in the network, the length of at least one side has been measured. Thus, the careful measurement of the length of one baseline can fix the scale of an entire triangulation network. In parallax, the triangle is extremely long and narrow, and by measuring both its shortest side (the motion of the observer) and the small top angle (always less than 1 [[arcsecond]],&lt;ref name=ZG44 /&gt; leaving the other two close to 90 degrees), the length of the long sides (in practice considered to be equal) can be determined.

Assuming the angle is small (see [[#Derivation|derivation]] below), the distance to an object (measured in [[parsec]]s) is the [[Reciprocal (mathematics)|reciprocal]] of the parallax (measured in [[arcsecond]]s): &lt;math&gt;d (\mathrm{pc}) = 1 / p (\mathrm{arcsec}).&lt;/math&gt; For example, the distance to [[Proxima Centauri]] is 1/0.7687={{convert|1.3009|pc|ly}}.&lt;ref name="apj118"/&gt;

=== Diurnal parallax ===
''Diurnal parallax'' is a parallax that varies with rotation of the Earth or with difference of location on the Earth. The Moon and to a smaller extent the [[terrestrial planet]]s or [[asteroid]]s seen from different viewing positions on the Earth (at one given moment) can appear differently placed against the background of fixed stars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

=== Lunar parallax ===&lt;!-- Other pages already link to this section hdg, please preserve it--&gt;
&lt;!-- under development: further special features of lunar px --&gt;
''Lunar parallax'' (often short for ''lunar horizontal parallax'' or ''lunar equatorial horizontal parallax''), is a special case of (diurnal) parallax: the Moon, being the nearest celestial body, has by far the largest maximum parallax of any celestial body, it can exceed 1 degree.&lt;ref name=aa1981 /&gt;

The diagram (above) for stellar parallax can illustrate lunar parallax as well, if the diagram is taken to be scaled right down and slightly modified. Instead of 'near star', read 'Moon', and instead of taking the circle at the bottom of the diagram to represent the size of the Earth's orbit around the Sun, take it to be the size of the Earth's globe, and of a circle around the Earth's surface. Then, the lunar (horizontal) parallax amounts to the difference in angular position, relative to the background of distant stars, of the Moon as seen from two different viewing positions on the Earth: one of the viewing positions is the place from which the Moon can be seen directly overhead at a given moment (that is, viewed along the vertical line in the diagram); and the other viewing position is a place from which the Moon can be seen on the horizon at the same moment (that is, viewed along one of the diagonal lines, from an Earth-surface position corresponding roughly to one of the blue dots on the modified diagram).

The lunar (horizontal) parallax can alternatively be defined as the angle subtended at the distance of the Moon by the radius of the Earth&lt;ref&gt;Astronomical Almanac, e.g. for 1981: see Glossary; for formulae see Explanatory Supplement to the Astronomical Almanac, 1992, p.400&lt;/ref&gt;—equal to angle p in the diagram when scaled-down and modified as mentioned above.

The lunar horizontal parallax at any time depends on the linear distance of the Moon from the Earth. The Earth–Moon linear distance varies continuously as the Moon follows its [[orbit of the moon|perturbed and approximately elliptical orbit]] around the Earth. The range of the variation in linear distance is from about 56 to 63.7 Earth radii, corresponding to horizontal parallax of about a degree of arc, but ranging from about 61.4' to about 54'.&lt;ref name=aa1981&gt;[[Astronomical Almanac]] e.g. for 1981, section D&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Astronomical Almanac]] and similar publications tabulate the lunar horizontal parallax and/or the linear distance of the Moon from the Earth on a periodical e.g. daily basis for the convenience of astronomers (and formerly, of navigators), and the study of the way in which this coordinate varies with time forms part of [[lunar theory]].

[[File:Lunaparallax.png|thumb|410px|right|Diagram of daily lunar parallax]]

Parallax can also be used to determine the distance to the [[Moon]].

One way to determine the lunar parallax from one location is by using a lunar eclipse. A full shadow of the Earth on the Moon has an apparent radius of curvature equal to the difference between the apparent radii of the Earth and the Sun as seen from the Moon. This radius can be seen to be equal to 0.75 degree, from which (with the solar apparent radius 0.25 degree) we get an Earth apparent radius of 1 degree. This yields for the Earth–Moon distance 60.27 Earth radii or {{convert|384399|km|mi}} This procedure was first used by [[Aristarchus of Samos]]&lt;ref name=Gutzwiller&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1103/RevModPhys.70.589 | title=Moon–Earth–Sun: The oldest three-body problem | date=1998 | author=Gutzwiller, Martin C. | journal=Reviews of Modern Physics | volume=70 | issue=2 | pages=589 | ref=harv | bibcode=1998RvMP...70..589G}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Hipparchus]], and later found its way into the work of [[Ptolemy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|contribution=3.2 Aristarchus, Hipparchus, and Ptolemy|pages=27–35|title=Measuring the Universe: The Cosmological Distance Ladder|first=Stephen|last=Webb|publisher=Springer|date=1999|isbn=9781852331061}}. See in particular p.&amp;nbsp;33: "Almost everything we know about Hipparchus comes down to us by way of Ptolemy."&lt;/ref&gt; The diagram at the right shows how daily lunar parallax arises on the geocentric and geostatic planetary model in which the Earth is at the centre of the planetary system and does not rotate. It also illustrates the important point that parallax need not be caused by any motion of the observer, contrary to some definitions of parallax that say it is, but may arise purely from motion of the observed.

Another method is to take two pictures of the Moon at exactly the same time from two locations on Earth and compare the positions of the Moon relative to the stars. Using the orientation of the Earth, those two position measurements, and the distance between the two locations on the Earth, the distance to the Moon can be triangulated:
:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{distance}_{\mathrm{moon}} = \frac {\mathrm{distance}_{\mathrm{observerbase}}} {\tan (\mathrm{angle})}&lt;/math&gt;

[[File:Lunarparallax 22 3 1988.png|thumb|right|Example of lunar parallax: Occultation of Pleiades by the Moon]]

This is the method referred to by [[Jules Verne]] in ''[[From the Earth to the Moon]]'': &lt;blockquote&gt;Until then, many people had no idea how one could calculate the distance separating the Moon from the Earth. The circumstance was exploited to teach them that this distance was obtained by measuring the parallax of the Moon. If the word parallax appeared to amaze them, they were told that it was the angle subtended by two straight lines running from both ends of the Earth's radius to the Moon. If they had doubts on the perfection of this method, they were immediately shown that not only did this mean distance amount to a whole two hundred thirty-four thousand three hundred and forty-seven miles (94,330 leagues), but also that the astronomers were not in error by more than seventy miles (≈ 30 leagues).&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Solar parallax ===
After [[Nicolaus Copernicus|Copernicus]] proposed his [[heliocentric system]], with the Earth in revolution around the Sun, it was possible to build a model of the whole Solar System without scale. To ascertain the scale, it is necessary only to measure one distance within the Solar System, e.g., the mean distance from the Earth to the Sun (now called an [[astronomical unit]], or AU). When found by [[triangulation]], this is referred to as the ''solar parallax'', the difference in position of the Sun as seen from the Earth's centre and a point one Earth radius away, i.&amp;nbsp;e., the angle subtended at the Sun by the Earth's mean radius. Knowing the solar parallax and the mean Earth radius allows one to calculate the AU, the first, small step on the long road of establishing the size and [[Age of the Universe|expansion age]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Freedman, W.L. | title=The Hubble constant and the expansion age of the Universe | journal=Physics Reports  | date=2000 | volume=333 | issue=1 | pages=13 | bibcode=2000PhR...333...13F | doi = 10.1016/S0370-1573(00)00013-2 | ref=harv | arxiv=astro-ph/9909076}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the visible Universe.

A primitive way to determine the distance to the Sun in terms of the distance to the Moon was already proposed by [[Aristarchus of Samos]] in his book ''[[Aristarchus On the Sizes and Distances|On the Sizes and Distances of the Sun and Moon]]''. He noted that the Sun, Moon, and Earth form a right triangle (with the right angle at the Moon) at the moment of [[lunar phase|first or last quarter moon]]. He then estimated that the Moon, Earth, Sun angle was 87°. Using correct [[geometry]] but inaccurate observational data, Aristarchus concluded that the Sun was slightly less than 20 times farther away than the Moon. The true value of this angle is close to 89° 50', and the Sun is actually about 390 times farther away.&lt;ref name=Gutzwiller/&gt; He pointed out that the Moon and Sun have nearly equal [[angle|apparent angular sizes]] and therefore their diameters must be in proportion to their distances from Earth. He thus concluded that the Sun was around 20 times larger than the Moon; this conclusion, although incorrect, follows logically from his incorrect data. It does suggest that the Sun is clearly larger than the Earth, which could be taken to support the heliocentric model.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Pathfinders: The Golden Age of Arabic Science|first=Jim|last=Al-Khalili|publisher=Penguin UK|date=2010|isbn=9780141965017|page=270|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ntLEUHTXxUMC&amp;pg=PT270|quote=Some have suggested that his calculation of the relative size of the earth and sun led Aristarchus to conclude that it made more sense for the earth to be moving around the much larger sun than the other way round.|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150317231828/http://books.google.com/books?id=ntLEUHTXxUMC&amp;pg=PT270|archivedate=2015-03-17|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Venus Transit &amp; Parallax.svg|thumb|right|Measuring Venus transit times to determine solar parallax]]

Although Aristarchus' results were incorrect due to observational errors, they were based on correct geometric principles of parallax, and became the basis for estimates of the size of the Solar System for almost 2000 years, until the [[transit of Venus]] was correctly observed in 1761 and 1769.&lt;ref name=Gutzwiller/&gt; This method was proposed by [[Edmond Halley]] in 1716, although he did not live to see the results. The use of Venus transits was less successful than had been hoped due to the [[black drop effect]], but the resulting estimate, 153 million kilometers, is just 2% above the currently accepted value, 149.6 million kilometers.

Much later, the Solar System was "scaled" using the parallax of [[asteroid]]s, some of which, such as [[433 Eros|Eros]], pass much closer to Earth than Venus. In a favourable opposition, Eros can approach the Earth to within 22&amp;nbsp;million kilometres.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Whipple|2007|loc=p. 47}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Both the opposition of 1901 and that of 1930/1931 were used for this purpose, the calculations of the latter determination being completed by [[Astronomer Royal]] Sir [[Harold Spencer Jones]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Whipple|2007|loc=p. 117}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Also [[radar]] reflections, both off Venus (1958) and off asteroids, like [[1566 Icarus|Icarus]], have been used for solar parallax determination. Today, use of [[spacecraft]] [[telemetry]] links has solved this old problem. The currently accepted value of solar parallax is 8".794 143.&lt;ref&gt;US Naval Observatory, [http://asa.usno.navy.mil/SecK/2010/Astronomical_Constants_2010.pdf Astronomical Constants] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720165511/http://asa.usno.navy.mil/SecK/2010/Astronomical_Constants_2010.pdf |date=2011-07-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Dynamical or moving-cluster parallax ===
{{main|Moving cluster method}}

The open stellar cluster [[Hyades (star cluster)|Hyades]] in [[Taurus (constellation)|Taurus]] extends over such a large part of the sky, 20 degrees, that the proper motions as derived from [[astrometry]] appear to converge with some precision to a perspective point north of Orion. Combining the observed apparent (angular) proper motion in seconds of arc with the also observed true (absolute) receding motion as witnessed by the [[Doppler effect|Doppler]] redshift of the stellar spectral lines, allows estimation of the distance to the cluster (151 light-years) and its member stars in much the same way as using annual parallax.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1086/307021  | title=A Precision Test of ''Hipparcos'' Systematics toward the Hyades | date=1999 | author=Vijay K. Narayanan | author2=Andrew Gould | journal=The Astrophysical Journal | volume=515 | issue=1 | pages=256 | ref=harv | arxiv=astro-ph/9808284 | bibcode=1999ApJ...515..256N}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dynamical parallax has sometimes also been used to determine the distance to a supernova, when the optical wave front of the outburst is seen to propagate through the surrounding dust clouds at an apparent angular velocity, while its true propagation velocity is known to be the [[speed of light]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1086/186164 | title=Properties of the SN 1987A circumstellar ring and the distance to the Large Magellanic Cloud | date=1991 | author=Panagia, N. | journal=The Astrophysical Journal | volume=380 | pages=L23 | display-authors=4 | last2=Gilmozzi | first2=R. | last3=MacChetto | first3=F. | last4=Adorf | first4=H.-M. | last5=Kirshner | first5=R. P. | ref=harv | bibcode=1991ApJ...380L..23P}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Derivation ===
For a [[right triangle]],
: &lt;math&gt;\tan p = \frac {1 \text{ AU}} {d} ,&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; is the parallax, {{convert|1|AU|km | abbr=on | sigfig=4 }} is approximately the average distance from the Sun to Earth, and &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; is the distance to the star.
Using [[small-angle approximation]]s (valid when the angle is small compared to 1 [[radian]]),
: &lt;math&gt;\tan x \approx x\text{ radians} = x \cdot \frac {180} {\pi} \text{ degrees} = x \cdot 180  \cdot \frac {3600} {\pi} \text{ arcseconds} ,&lt;/math&gt;
so the parallax, measured in arcseconds, is
:&lt;math&gt;p'' \approx \frac {1 \text{ AU}} {d} \cdot 180 \cdot \frac{3600} {\pi} .&lt;/math&gt;
If the parallax is 1", then the distance is
:&lt;math&gt;d = 1 \text{ AU}  \cdot 180 \cdot \frac {3600} {\pi} \approx 206,265 \text{ AU} \approx 3.2616 \text{ ly} \equiv 1 \text{ parsec} .&lt;/math&gt;
This ''defines'' the [[parsec]], a convenient unit for measuring distance using parallax. Therefore, the distance, measured in parsecs, is simply &lt;math&gt;d = 1 / p&lt;/math&gt;, when the parallax is given in arcseconds.&lt;ref&gt;Similar derivations are in most astronomy textbooks. See, e. g., {{harvnb|Zeilik|Gregory|1998|loc=&amp;sect; 11-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Error===
Precise parallax measurements of distance have an associated [[error]]. However this error in the measured parallax angle does not translate directly into an error for the distance, except for relatively small errors. The reason for this is that an error toward a smaller angle results in a greater error in distance than an error toward a larger angle.

However, an approximation of the distance error can be computed by
:&lt;math&gt;\delta d = \delta \left( {1 \over p} \right) =\left| {\partial \over \partial p} \left( {1 \over p} \right) \right| \delta p ={\delta p \over p^2}&lt;/math&gt;
where ''d'' is the distance and ''p'' is the parallax. The approximation is far more accurate for parallax errors that are small relative to the parallax than for relatively large errors. For meaningful results in [[stellar astronomy]], Dutch astronomer Floor van Leeuwen recommends that the parallax error be no more than 10% of the total parallax when computing this error estimate.&lt;ref name=van_leeuwen2007&gt;{{cite book | first1=Floor | last1=van Leeuwen | title=Hipparcos, the new reduction of the raw data | volume=350 | series=Astrophysics and space science library | publisher=Springer | date=2007 | isbn=1-4020-6341-5 | page=86 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oU72XEf_5lEC&amp;pg=PA86 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150318002121/http://books.google.com/books?id=oU72XEf_5lEC&amp;pg=PA86 | archivedate=2015-03-18 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Spatio-temporal parallax ===
From enhanced ''relativistic positioning systems'', '''spatio-temporal parallax''' generalizing the usual notion of parallax in space only has been developed. Then, eventfields in spacetime can be deduced directly without intermediate models of light bending by massive bodies such as the one used in the [[Parameterized post-Newtonian formalism|PPN formalism]] for instance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Rubin, J.L. | title=Relativistic Pentametric Coordinates from Relativistic Localizing Systems and the Projective Geometry of the Spacetime Manifold | journal=Electronic Journal of Theoretical Physics | date=2015 | volume=12 | issue=32 | pages=83–112 | url=http://www.ejtp.com/volumes.html | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150208153753/http://www.ejtp.com/volumes.html | archivedate=2015-02-08 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== {{Anchor|Parallax error}}Metrology ==
[[File:Parallax pointer error.PNG|thumb|The correct line of sight needs to be used to avoid parallax error.]]
Measurements made by viewing the position of some marker relative to something to be measured are subject to parallax error if the marker is some distance away from the object of measurement and not viewed from the correct position. For example, if measuring the distance between two ticks on a line with a ruler marked on its top surface, the thickness of the ruler will separate its markings from the ticks. If viewed from a position not exactly perpendicular to the ruler, the apparent position will shift and the reading will be less accurate than the ruler is capable of.

A similar error occurs when reading the position of a pointer against a scale in an instrument such as an analog [[multimeter]]. To help the user avoid this problem, the scale is sometimes printed above a narrow strip of [[mirror]], and the user's eye is positioned so that the pointer obscures its own reflection, guaranteeing that the user's line of sight is perpendicular to the mirror and therefore to the scale. The same effect alters the speed read on a car's speedometer by a driver in front of it and a passenger off to the side, values read from a [[Oscilloscope#Graticule|graticule]] not in actual contact with the display on an [[oscilloscope]], etc.

== Photogrammetry ==
Aerial picture pairs, when viewed through a stereo viewer, offer a pronounced stereo effect of landscape and buildings. High buildings appear to 'keel over' in the direction away from the centre of the photograph. Measurements of this parallax are used to deduce the height of the buildings, provided that flying height and baseline distances are known. This is a key component to the process of [[photogrammetry]].

== Photography ==
[[File:Contax III IMG 5349-white.JPG|thumb|Contax III rangefinder camera with [[macro photography]] setting. Because the viewfinder is on top of the lens and of the close proximity of the subject, goggles are fitted in front of the rangefinder and a dedicated viewfinder installed to compensate for parallax.]]
[[File:Parallax detalj-1.jpg|thumb|left|Failed panoramic image due to the parallax, since axis of rotation of tripod is not same of focal point.]]

Parallax error can be seen when taking photos with many types of cameras, such as [[twin-lens reflex camera]]s and those including [[viewfinder]]s (such as [[rangefinder camera]]s). In such cameras, the eye sees the subject through different optics (the viewfinder, or a second lens) than the one through which the photo is taken. As the viewfinder is often found above the lens of the camera, photos with parallax error are often slightly lower than intended, the classic example being the image of person with his or her head cropped off. This problem is addressed in [[single-lens reflex camera]]s, in which the viewfinder sees through the same lens through which the photo is taken (with the aid of a movable mirror), thus avoiding parallax error.

Parallax is also an issue in [[image stitching]], such as for panoramas.

==Sights==
Parallax affects [[sight (device)|sighting devices]] of [[ranged weapon]]s in many ways.  On sights fitted on [[small arms]] and [[Bow and arrow|bows]], etc. the perpendicular distance between the sight and the weapon's launch axis (e.g. the [[bore axis]] of a gun) — generally referred to as "''sight height''" — can induce significant aiming errors when shooting at close range, particularly when shooting at small targets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dexadine.com/bexhelp/bexhelp23.htm|title=Ballistic Explorer Help|website=www.dexadine.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928025148/http://www.dexadine.com/bexhelp/bexhelp23.htm|archivedate=2011-09-28|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This parallax error is compensated for (when needed) via calculations that also take in other variables such as [[bullet drop]], [[windage]], and the distance at which the target is expected to be.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crossbowmen.com/index.htm.trajectory.html|title=Crossbows / Arrows &amp; Bolts / Trajectory / Trajectories.|website=www.crossbowmen.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708205657/http://www.crossbowmen.com/index.htm.trajectory.html|archivedate=2011-07-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Sight height can be used to advantage when "sighting-in" rifles for field use.  A typical hunting rifle (.222 with telescopic sights) sighted-in at 75m will still be useful from 50m to 200m without needing further adjustment.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

===Optical sights===
{{further|Telescopic sight#Parallax compensation}}
[[File:Telescopic Sight Parallax Animation.gif|thumb|Simple animation demonstrating the effects of parallax compensation in telescopic sights, as the eye moves relative to the sight.]]
In some [[reticle]]d [[optical instrument]]s such as [[telescope]]s, [[microscope]]s or in [[telescopic sight]]s ("scopes") used on [[small arm]]s and [[theodolite]]s, parallax can create problems with aiming when the reticle is not [[coincident]] with the [[focal plane]] of the target image.  This is because when the reticle and the target are not at the same focus, the optically corresponded distances being projected through the [[eyepiece]] are also different, and the user's eye will register that parallax difference between the reticle and the target whenever eye position changes.  The term ''parallax shift'' refers to the resultant apparent "floating" movements of the reticle in relationship to the target when the user moves his/her head laterally (up/down or left/right) behind the sight,&lt;ref&gt;[https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:7K5DUJIWkfoJ:viriato.net/airgunning/bfta_setup_manual.pdf+%22telescopic+sight%22+distance+between+the+barrel+and+the+sight&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEESh3l7c_sNAgPEc3pbi6xyOuPivRDqgtADQhQz9jsvCIPVSSrKbgSHShbhakGmiPhSO2lOO6WpI93M9BzMb0C8D3I_a1O9t48hZxEhhYpxufb3xc1hfnI2yfeqycoYyYIg5YezT-&amp;sig=AHIEtbRaBc5RSwmyLPTzzrOTb4sGSQvTHg&amp;pli=1 Setting Up An Air Rifle And Telescopic Sight For Field Target - An Instruction Manual For Beginners, page 16]&lt;/ref&gt; i.e. it is an error where the reticle does not stay aligned with the sight's own [[optical axis]].

Some firearm scopes are equipped with a parallax compensation mechanism, which basically consists of a movable optical element that enables the optical system to shift the focus of the target image at varying distances into the exact same optical plane of the reticle.  Many low-tier telescopic sights may have no parallax compensation because in practice they can still perform very acceptably without eliminating parallax shift, in which case the scope is often set fixed at a designated parallax-free distance that best suits their intended usage.  Typical standard factory parallax-free distances for hunting scopes are 100&amp;nbsp;yd or 100&amp;nbsp;m to make them suited for hunting shots that rarely exceed 300&amp;nbsp;yd/m. Some target and military style scopes without parallax compensation may be adjusted to be parallax free at ranges up to 300&amp;nbsp;yd/m to make them better suited for aiming at longer ranges.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} Scopes for [[Rimfire ammunition|rimfires]], [[shotgun]]s, and [[muzzleloader]]s will have shorter parallax settings, commonly 50&amp;nbsp;yd/m{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} for rimfire scopes and 100&amp;nbsp;yd/m{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} for shotguns and muzzleloaders. Scopes for [[airgun]]s are very often found with adjustable parallax, usually in the form of an adjustable objective (or "AO" for short)design.  These may adjust down as far as {{convert|3|yd|m|abbr=off}}.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

Non-magnifying [[Reflector sight|reflector or "reflex" sights]] have the ability to be theoretically "parallax free." But since these sights use parallel [[collimated light]] this is only true when the target is at infinity. At finite distances eye movement perpendicular to the device will cause parallax movement in the reticle image in exact relationship to eye position in the cylindrical column of light created by the collimating optics.&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia of Bullseye Pistol"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bullseyepistol.com/dotsight.htm|title=Encyclopedia of Bullseye Pistol|website=www.bullseyepistol.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708104623/http://www.bullseyepistol.com/dotsight.htm|archivedate=2011-07-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;American rifleman: Volume 93, National Rifle Association of America - THE REFLECTOR SIGHT By JOHN B. BUTLER, page 31&lt;/ref&gt; Firearm sights, such as some [[red dot sights]], try to correct for this via not focusing the reticle at infinity, but instead at some finite distance, a designed target range where the reticle will show very little movement due to parallax.&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia of Bullseye Pistol"/&gt; Some manufactures market reflector sight models they call "parallax free,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIKH5GLpL5g|title=Aimpoint's parallax-free, double lens system...

== Artillery gunfire ==
&lt;!-- Note: see [[Talk:Parallax#Artillery]]! --&gt;Because of the positioning of [[Field artillery|field]] or [[naval artillery]] guns, each one has a slightly different perspective of the target relative to the location of the [[fire-control system]] itself. Therefore, when aiming its guns at the target, the fire control system must compensate for parallax in order to assure that [[Gunshot|fire]] from each gun converges on the target.

==Rangefinders==
[[File:Telemetre parallaxe principe.svg|thumb|right|Parallax theory for finding naval distances]]

A [[coincidence rangefinder]] or parallax rangefinder can be used to find distance to a target.

== As a metaphor ==
In a philosophic/geometric sense: an apparent change in the direction of an object, caused by a change in observational position that provides a new line of sight. The apparent displacement, or difference of position, of an object, as seen from two different stations, or points of view. In contemporary writing parallax can also be the same story, or a similar story from approximately the same time line, from one book told from a different perspective in another book. The word and concept feature prominently in [[James Joyce]]'s 1922 novel, ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]''. [[Orson Scott Card]] also used the term when referring to [[Ender's Shadow]] as compared to [[Ender's Game]].

The metaphor is invoked by Slovenian philosopher [[Slavoj Žižek]] in his work ''[[The Parallax View (book)|The Parallax View]]'', borrowing the concept of "parallax view" from the Japanese philosopher and literary critic [[Kojin Karatani]]. Žižek notes, 
{{Quote|text=The philosophical twist to be added (to parallax), of course, is that the observed distance is not simply subjective, since the same object that exists 'out there' is seen from two different stances, or points of view. It is rather that, as [[Hegel]] would have put it, subject and object are inherently mediated so that an '[[epistemological]]' shift in the subject's point of view always reflects an [[ontological]] shift in the object itself. Or—to put it in [[Jacques Lacan|Lacan]]ese—the subject's gaze is always-already inscribed into the perceived object itself, in the guise of its 'blind spot,' that which is 'in the object more than object itself', the point from which the object itself returns the gaze. Sure the picture is in my eye, but I am also in the picture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | last = Žižek  | first = Slavoj  | authorlink = Slavoj Žižek  | title = The Parallax View  | publisher = [[The MIT Press]]  | date = 2006 | pages = 17 | isbn = 0-262-24051-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; |author= Slavoj Žižek |title=The Parallax View }}

'''Patrick Colonel Suppes''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|ʊ|p|ɪ|s}}; March 17, 1922 – November 17, 2014) was an [[United States|American]] [[philosopher]] who made significant contributions to [[philosophy of science]], the theory of [[measurement]], the foundations of [[quantum mechanics]], [[decision theory]], [[psychology]] and [[educational technology]]. He was the Lucie Stern Professor of Philosophy Emeritus at [[Stanford University]] and until January 2010 was the Director of the [[Education Program for Gifted Youth]] also at Stanford.

== Early life and career ==
Suppes was born on March 17, 1922, in [[Tulsa, Oklahoma|Tulsa]], [[Oklahoma]]. He grew up as an only child, later with a half brother George who was born in 1943 after Patrick had entered the army. His grandfather, C.E. Suppes, had moved to Oklahoma from Ohio. Suppes' father and grandfather were independent oil men. His mother died when he was a young boy. He was raised by his stepmother, who married his father before he was six years old. His parents did not have much formal education.&lt;ref name="SAB"&gt;Cf. Suppes autobiography&lt;/ref&gt;

Suppes began college at the [[University of Oklahoma]] in 1939, but transferred to the [[University of Chicago]] in his second year, citing boredom with intellectual life in Oklahoma as his primary motivation. In his third year, at the insistence of his family, Suppes attended the [[University of Tulsa]], majoring in [[physics]], before entering the [[Army Reserves]] in 1942. In 1943 he returned to the University of Chicago and graduated with a B.S. in [[meteorology]], and was stationed shortly thereafter at the [[Solomon Islands]] to serve during [[World War II]].&lt;ref name="SAB"/&gt;

Suppes was discharged from the [[United States Army Air Forces|Army Air Force]] in 1946.&lt;ref name="SAB"/&gt; In January 1947 he entered [[Columbia University]] as a graduate student in philosophy as a student of [[Ernest Nagel]] and received a [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] in 1950.&lt;ref name="SAB"/&gt; In 1952 he went to [[Stanford University]], and from 1959 to 1992 he was the director of the [[IMSSS|Institute for Mathematical Studies in the Social Sciences (IMSSS)]]. He would subsequently become the Lucie Stern Professor of Philosophy, Emeritus, at Stanford.

== Work ==

=== Computer-aided learning ===
In the 1960s Suppes and [[Richard C. Atkinson]] (the future president of the [[University of California]]) conducted experiments in using computers to teach math and reading to school children in the [[Palo Alto, California|Palo Alto]] area.&lt;ref&gt;http://suppes-corpus.stanford.edu/techreports/IMSSS_174.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Stanford's [[Education Program for Gifted Youth]] and Computer Curriculum Corporation (CCC, now named Pearson Education Technologies) are indirect descendants of those early experiments.&lt;ref&gt;Kulik, James A., [https://www.nsf.gov/statistics/infbrief/nsf03301/ "School Mathematics and Science Programs Benefit From Instructional Technology"], NSF Info Brief, NSF 03-301, November 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; At Stanford, Suppes was instrumental in encouraging the development of high-technology companies that were springing up in the field of educational software up into the 1990s, (such as [[Bien Logic]]).

One computer used in Suppes and Atkinson's Computer-assisted Instruction (CAI) experiments was the specialized [[IBM 1500]] Instructional System. Seeded by a research grant in 1964 from the U.S. Department of Education to the Institute for Mathematical Studies in the Social Sciences at Stanford University, the IBM 1500 CAI system was initially prototyped at the Brentwood Elementary School (Ravenswood City School District) in [[East Palo Alto, California]] by Suppes. The students first used the system in 1966.&lt;ref&gt;Suppes, Patrick,

Canadian Journal of Educational Communication, 21(2), 153–170. (also: [http://www.cjlt.ca/index.php/cjlt/issue/view/45 full journal issue])&lt;/ref&gt;

Suppes' Dial-a-Drill program was a touchtone phone interface for CAI. Ten schools around Manhattan were involved in the program which delivered three lessons per week by telephone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Learning by phone|last=|first=|date=March 8, 1969|work=New York Amsterdam News|access-date=|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dial-a-Drill adjusted the routine for students who answered two questions incorrectly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The management of education: A systematic design for educational revolution|last=Umans|first=S|publisher=Doubleday|year=1970|isbn=|location=Garden City, N.Y|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The system went online in March 1969. Touchtone telephones were installed in the homes of children participating in the program. Field workers educated parents on the benefits of the program and collected feedback.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Final Report: An Evaluation of the Dial-A-Drill Program|last=Beech|first=R.

=== Decision theory ===
During the 1950s and 1960s Suppes collaborated with [[Donald Davidson (philosopher)|Donald Davidson]] on [[decision theory]], at Stanford. Their initial work followed lines of thinking which had been anticipated in 1926 by [[Frank P. Ramsey]], and involved experimental testing of their theories, culminating in the 1957 monograph ''[[Decision Making: An Experimental Approach]]''. Such commentators as [[Kirk Ludwig]] trace the origins of Davidson's theory of [[radical interpretation]] to his formative work with Suppes.&lt;ref&gt;http://catdir.loc.gov/catdir/samples/cam033/2002035082.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''Penrose tiling''' is an example of non-periodic [[tessellation|tiling]] generated by an [[aperiodic set of prototiles|aperiodic set]] of [[prototile]]s. Penrose tilings are named after mathematician and physicist Sir [[Roger Penrose]], who investigated these sets in the 1970s. The aperiodicity of prototiles implies that a shifted copy of a tiling will never match the original. A Penrose tiling may be constructed so as to exhibit both [[reflection symmetry]] and fivefold [[rotational symmetry]], as in the diagram at the right.

Penrose tiling is non-periodic, which means that it lacks any [[translational symmetry]]. It is [[self-similarity|self-similar]], so the same patterns occur at larger and larger scales. Thus, the tiling can be obtained through "inflation" (or "deflation") and every finite patch from the tiling occurs infinitely many times. It is a [[quasicrystal]]: implemented as a physical structure a Penrose tiling will produce [[Bragg diffraction]] and its diffractogram reveals both the fivefold symmetry and the underlying long range order.

Various methods to construct Penrose tilings have been discovered, including matching rules, [[substitution tiling|substitutions]] or [[finite subdivision rule|subdivision rule]]s, cut and project schemes and coverings.

==Background and history==

===Periodic and aperiodic tilings===

{{anchor|Figure 1}}[[File:RegularRhombs.svg|right|thumb|150px|Figure 1. Part of a periodic tiling|alt=]]
Penrose tilings are simple examples of [[aperiodic tiling]]s of the [[plane (geometry)|plane]].&lt;ref&gt;General references for this article include {{Harvnb|Gardner|1997|pp=1&amp;ndash;30}}, {{Harvnb|Grünbaum|Shephard|1987|pp=520&amp;ndash;548 &amp;amp; 558&amp;ndash;579}}, and {{Harvnb|Senechal|1996|pp=170&amp;ndash;206}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A [[tessellation|tiling]] is a covering of the plane by tiles with no overlaps or gaps; the tiles normally have a [[finite set|finite]] number of shapes, called ''[[prototile]]s'', and [[set (mathematics)|a set]] of prototiles is said to ''admit a tiling'' or ''tile the plane'' if there is a tiling of the plane using only tiles [[congruence (geometry)|congruent]] to these prototiles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gardner|1997|pp=20, 23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most familiar tilings (e.g., by squares or triangles) are [[periodic tiling|periodic]]: a perfect copy of the tiling can be obtained by [[translation (mathematics)|translating]] all of the tiles by a fixed distance in a given direction. Such a translation is called a ''period'' of the tiling; more informally, this means that a finite region of the tiling repeats itself in periodic intervals. If a tiling has no periods it is said to be ''non-periodic''. A set of prototiles is said to be ''aperiodic'' if it tiles the plane but every such tiling is non-periodic; tilings by aperiodic sets of prototiles are called aperiodic tilings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Grünbaum|Shephard|1987|p=520}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Earliest aperiodic tilings===
[[File:Wang tiles.svg|thumb|left|150px|An [[aperiodic set]] of [[Wang domino]]es.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Culik|Kari|1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;|alt=]]
The subject of aperiodic tilings received new interest in the 1960s when logician [[Hao Wang (academic)|Hao Wang]] noted connections between [[decision problem]]s and tilings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wang|1961}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, he introduced tilings by square plates with colored edges, now known as ''[[Wang domino]]es'' or ''tiles'', and posed the "''[[Domino Problem]]''": to determine whether a given set of Wang dominoes could tile the plane with matching colors on adjacent domino edges. He observed that if this problem were [[recursive set|undecidable]], then there would have to exist an aperiodic set of Wang dominoes. At the time, this seemed implausible, so Wang conjectured no such set could exist.

[[File:Robinson tiles.svg|thumb|right|Robinson's six prototiles|alt=]]
Wang's student [[Robert Berger (mathematician)|Robert Berger]] proved that the Domino Problem was undecidable (so Wang's conjecture was incorrect) in his 1964 thesis,&lt;ref&gt;{{MathGenealogy|id=114475|title=Robert Berger}}&lt;/ref&gt; and obtained an aperiodic set of 20426 Wang dominoes.&lt;ref name="AMSa"&gt;{{Harvnb|Austin|2005a}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also described a reduction to 104 such prototiles; the latter did not appear in his published monograph,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Berger|1966}}&lt;/ref&gt; but in 1968, [[Donald Knuth]] detailed a modification of Berger's set requiring only 92 dominoes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Grünbaum|Shephard|1987|p=584}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The color matching required in a tiling by Wang dominoes can easily be achieved by modifying the edges of the tiles like [[jigsaw puzzle]] pieces so that they can fit together only as prescribed by the edge colorings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gardner|1997|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Raphael Robinson]], in a 1971 paper&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Robinson|1971}}&lt;/ref&gt; which simplified Berger's techniques and undecidability proof, used this technique to obtain an aperiodic set of just six prototiles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Grünbaum|Shephard|1987|p=525}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Development of the Penrose tilings===
{{anchor|Figure 2}}[[File:Penrose Tiling (P1 over P3).svg|250px|thumb|left|Figure 2. The pentagonal Penrose tiling (P1) drawn in black on a colored rhombus tiling (P3) with yellow edges.&lt;ref name="S:173-174"&gt;{{Harvnb|Senechal|1996|pp=173–174}}&lt;/ref&gt;|alt=]]

The first Penrose tiling (tiling P1 below) is an aperiodic set of six prototiles, introduced by [[Roger Penrose]] in a 1974 paper,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Penrose|1974}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it is based on pentagons rather than squares. Any attempt to tile the plane with regular pentagons necessarily leaves gaps, but [[Johannes Kepler]] showed, in his 1619 work ''[[Harmonices Mundi]]'', that these gaps can be filled using [[pentagram]]s ([[star polygon]]s), [[decagon]]s and related shapes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Grünbaum|Shephard|1987|loc=section 2.5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traces of these ideas can also be found in the work of [[Albrecht Dürer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Luck|2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; Acknowledging inspiration from Kepler, Penrose found matching rules (which can be imposed by decorations of the edges) for these shapes, obtaining an aperiodic set. His tiling can be viewed as a completion of Kepler's finite ''Aa'' pattern.&lt;ref name="S:171"&gt;{{Harvnb|Senechal|1996|p=171}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Penrose subsequently reduced the number of prototiles to two, discovering the kite and dart tiling (tiling P2 below) and the rhombus tiling (tiling P3 below).&lt;ref name="G:6"&gt;{{Harvnb|Gardner|1997|p=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rhombus tiling was independently discovered by [[Robert Ammann]] in 1976.&lt;ref name="G:19"&gt;{{Harvnb|Gardner|1997|p=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Penrose and [[John H. Conway]] investigated the properties of Penrose tilings, and discovered that a substitution property explained their hierarchical nature; their findings were publicized by [[Martin Gardner]] in his January 1977 "[[Mathematical Games column]]" in ''[[Scientific American]]''.&lt;ref name="G1"&gt;{{Harvnb|Gardner|1997|loc=chapter 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1981, [[Nicolaas Govert de Bruijn|De Bruijn]] explained a method to construct Penrose tilings&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|de Bruijn|1981}}&lt;/ref&gt; from five families of parallel lines as well as a "cut and project method", in which Penrose tilings are obtained as two-dimensional projections from a five-dimensional cubic structure. In this approach, the Penrose tiling is viewed as a set of points, its vertices, while the tiles are geometrical shapes obtained by connecting vertices with edges.

==The Penrose tilings==
[[File:Penrose Tiling (P1).svg|thumb|right|200px|A P1 tiling using Penrose's original set of six prototiles|alt=]]

The three types of Penrose tiling, P1&amp;ndash;P3, are described individually below.&lt;ref name="P1-P3"&gt;The P1&amp;ndash;P3 notation is taken from {{Harvnb|Grünbaum|Shephard|1987|loc=section 10.3}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have many common features: in each case, the tiles are constructed from shapes related to the pentagon (and hence to the [[golden ratio]]), but the basic tile shapes need to be supplemented by ''matching rules'' in order to tile aperiodically; these rules may be described using labeled vertices or edges, or patterns on the tile faces &amp;ndash; alternatively the edge profile can be modified (e.g. by indentations and protrusions) to obtain an aperiodic set of prototiles.&lt;ref name="AMSa" /&gt;&lt;ref name="GS10.3"&gt;{{Harvnb|Grünbaum|Shephard|1987|loc=section 10.3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The original pentagonal Penrose tiling (P1)===
Penrose's first tiling uses pentagons and three other shapes: a five-pointed "star" (a pentagram), a "boat" (roughly 3/5 of a star) and a "diamond" (a thin rhombus).&lt;ref name="P:32"/&gt; To ensure that all tilings are non-periodic, there are matching rules that specify how tiles may meet each other, and there are three different types of matching rule for the pentagonal tiles. It is common to indicate the three different types of pentagonal tiles using three different colors, as in the figure above right.&lt;ref&gt;"However, as will be explained momentarily, differently colored pentagons will be considered to be different types of tiles." {{Harvnb|Austin|2005a}}; {{Harvnb|Grünbaum|Shephard|1987|loc=figure 10.3.1}}, shows the edge modifications needed to yield an aperiodic set of prototiles.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kite and dart tiling (P2)===

[[File:Step7wPaper600DPI.png|thumb|Part of the plane covered by Penrose [[tessellation|tiling]] of type P2 (kite and dart). Created by applying several deflations, see section below.]]

Penrose's second tiling uses quadrilaterals called the "kite" and "dart", which may be combined to make a rhombus. However, the matching rules prohibit such a combination.&lt;ref&gt;"The rhombus of course tiles periodically, but we are not allowed to join the pieces in this manner." {{Harvnb|Gardner|1997|pp=6&amp;ndash;7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both the kite and dart are composed of two triangles, called ''[[Golden triangle (mathematics)#Golden gnomon|Robinson triangles]]'', after 1975 notes by Robinson.&lt;ref name="GS-R"&gt;{{Harvnb|Grünbaum|Shephard|1987|pp=537&amp;ndash; 547}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{multiple image|align=left|direction=vertical|image1=Kite Dart.svg|image2=Penrose vertex figures.svg|width=225|footer=Kite and dart tiles (top) and the seven possible [[vertex figure]]s in a P2 tiling.}}

*The ''kite'' is a quadrilateral whose four interior angles are 72, 72, 72, and 144 degrees. The kite may be bisected along its axis of symmetry to form a pair of acute Robinson triangles (with angles of 36, 72 and 72 degrees).
*The ''dart'' is a non-convex quadrilateral whose four interior angles are 36, 72, 36, and 216 degrees. The dart may be bisected along its axis of symmetry to form a pair of obtuse Robinson triangles (with angles of 36, 36 and 108 degrees), which are smaller than the acute triangles.

The matching rules can be described in several ways. One approach is to color the vertices (with two colors, e.g., black and white) and require that adjacent tiles have matching vertices.&lt;ref name="S:173"&gt;{{Harvnb|Senechal|1996|p=173}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another is to use a pattern of circular arcs (as shown above left in green and red) to constrain the placement of tiles: when two tiles share an edge in a tiling, the patterns must match at these edges.&lt;ref name="G:6"/&gt;

These rules often force the placement of certain tiles: for example, the [[concave polygon|concave]] vertex of any dart is necessarily filled by two kites. The corresponding figure (center of the top row in the lower image on the left) is called an "ace" by Conway; although it looks like an enlarged kite, it does not tile in the same way.&lt;ref name="G:8"&gt;{{Harvnb|Gardner|1997|p=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly the concave vertex formed when two kites meet along a short edge is necessarily filled by two darts (bottom right). In fact, there are only seven possible ways for the tiles to meet at a vertex; two of these figures &amp;ndash; namely, the "star" (top left) and the "sun" (top right) &amp;ndash; have 5-fold [[dihedral symmetry]] (by rotations and reflections), while the remainder have a single axis of reflection (vertical in the image).&lt;ref name="G:10=11"&gt;{{Harvnb|Gardner|1997|pp=10&amp;ndash;11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from the ace and the sun, all of these vertex figures force the placement of additional tiles.&lt;ref name="G:12"&gt;{{Harvnb|Gardner|1997|p=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rhombus tiling (P3)===
[[File:Penrose rhombs matching rules.svg|right|thumb|Matching rule for Penrose rhombs using circular arcs or edge modifications|alt=]]
The third tiling uses a pair of [[rhombus]]es (often referred to as "[[wikt:rhomb|rhombs]]" in this context) with equal sides but different angles.&lt;ref name="AMSa"/&gt; Ordinary rhombus-shaped tiles can be used to tile the plane periodically, so restrictions must be made on how tiles can be assembled: no two tiles may form a parallelogram, as this would allow a periodic tiling, but this constraint is not sufficient to force aperiodicity, as [[#Figure 1|figure 1 above]] shows.

There are two kinds of tile, both of which can be decomposed into Robinson triangles.&lt;ref name="GS-R"/&gt;
*The thin rhomb '''t''' has four corners with angles of 36, 144, 36, and 144 degrees. The '''t''' rhomb may be bisected along its short diagonal to form a pair of acute Robinson triangles.
*The thick rhomb '''T''' has angles of 72, 108, 72, and 108 degrees. The '''T''' rhomb may be bisected along its long diagonal to form a pair of obtuse Robinson triangles; in contrast to the P2 tiling, these are larger than the acute triangles.

The matching rules distinguish sides of the tiles, and entail that tiles may be juxtaposed in certain particular ways but not in others. Two ways to describe these matching rules are shown in the image on the right. In one form, tiles must be assembled such that the curves on the faces match in color and position across an edge. In the other, tiles must be assembled such that the bumps on their edges fit together.&lt;ref name="AMSa"/&gt;

There are 54 cyclically ordered combinations of such angles that add up to 360 degrees at a vertex, but the rules of the tiling allow only seven of these combinations to appear (although one of these arises in two ways).&lt;ref name="S:178"&gt;{{Harvnb|Senechal|1996|p=178}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The various combinations of angles and facial curvature allow construction of arbitrarily complex tiles, such as the ''[http://www.murderousmaths.co.uk/books/BKMM7xpc.htm Penrose chickens]''.

==Features and constructions==

===The golden ratio and local pentagonal symmetry===
Several properties and common features of the Penrose tilings involve the [[golden ratio]] {{φ}} = (1+{{radic|5}})/2 (approximately 1.618).&lt;ref name="GS-R" /&gt;&lt;ref name="S:173"/&gt; This is the ratio of [[Chord (geometry)|chord]] lengths to side lengths in a [[regular pentagon]], and satisfies {{φ}} = 1 + 1/{{φ}}.

[[File:Rhomb pentagon.svg|left|thumb|Pentagon with an inscribed thick rhomb (light), acute Robinson triangles (lightly shaded) and a small obtuse Robinson triangle (darker). Dotted lines give additional edges for inscribed kites and darts.|alt=]]

Consequently, the ratio of the lengths of long sides to short sides in the ([[isosceles]]) Robinson triangles is {{φ}}:1. It follows that the ratio of long side lengths to short in both kite and dart tiles is also {{φ}}:1, as are the length ratios of sides to the short diagonal in the thin rhomb '''t''', and of long diagonal to sides in the thick rhomb '''T'''. In both the P2 and P3 tilings, the ratio of the [[Triangle#Computing the area of a triangle|area]] of the larger Robinson triangle to the smaller one is {{φ}}:1, hence so are the ratios of the areas of the kite to the dart, and of the thick rhomb to the thin rhomb. (Both larger and smaller obtuse Robinson triangles can be found in the pentagon on the left: the larger triangles at the top &amp;ndash; the halves of the thick rhomb &amp;ndash; have linear dimensions scaled up by {{φ}} compared to the small shaded triangle at the base, and so the ratio of areas is {{φ}}&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;:1.)

Any Penrose tiling has local pentagonal symmetry, in the sense that there are points in the tiling surrounded by a symmetric configuration of tiles: such configurations have fivefold [[rotational symmetry]] about the center point, as well as five mirror lines of [[reflection symmetry]] passing through the point, a [[dihedral group|dihedral]] symmetry [[group (mathematics)|group]].&lt;ref name="AMSa"/&gt; This symmetry will generally preserve only a patch of tiles around the center point, but the patch can be very large: Conway and Penrose proved that whenever the colored curves on the P2 or P3 tilings close in a loop, the region within the loop has pentagonal symmetry, and furthermore, in any tiling, there are at most two such curves of each color that do not close up.&lt;ref name="G:9"&gt;{{Harvnb|Gardner|1997|p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There can be at most one center point of global fivefold symmetry: if there were more than one, then rotating each about the other would yield two closer centers of fivefold symmetry, which leads to a mathematical contradiction.&lt;ref name="G:27"&gt;{{Harvnb|Gardner|1997|p=27}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are only two Penrose tilings (of each type) with global pentagonal symmetry: for the P2 tiling by kites and darts, the center point is either a "sun" or "star" vertex.&lt;ref name="GS:543"&gt;{{Harvnb|Grünbaum|Shephard|1987|p=543}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Inflation and deflation===
[[File:Pentagon with half dodecahedral net.svg|right|thumb|A pentagon decomposed into six smaller pentagons (half a dodecahedral net) with gaps|alt=]]
Many of the common features of Penrose tilings follow from a hierarchical pentagonal structure given by ''[[Substitution tiling|substitution rules]]'': this is often referred to as ''inflation'' and ''deflation'', or ''composition'' and ''decomposition'', of tilings or (collections of) tiles.&lt;ref name="AMSa"/&gt;&lt;ref name="G1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GS-Terms"&gt;In {{Harvnb|Grünbaum|Shephard|1987}}, the term "inflation" is used where other authors would use "deflation" (followed by rescaling). The terms "composition" and "decomposition", which many authors also use, are less ambiguous.&lt;/ref&gt; The substitution rules decompose each tile into smaller tiles of the same shape as those used in the tiling (and thus allow larger tiles to be "composed" from smaller ones). This shows that the Penrose tiling has a scaling self-similarity, and so can be thought of as a [[fractal]].&lt;ref&gt;Ramachandrarao P.,
''On the fractal nature of Penrose tiling'', Current Science '''79'''(2000) p364 [http://www.iisc.ernet.in/currsci/aug102000/rc80.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

Penrose originally discovered the P1 tiling in this way, by decomposing a pentagon into six smaller pentagons (one half of a [[Net (polyhedron)|net]] of a [[dodecahedron]]) and five half-diamonds; he then observed that when he repeated this process the gaps between pentagons could all be filled by stars, diamonds, boats and other pentagons.&lt;ref name="P:32"&gt;{{Harvnb|Penrose|1978|p=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; By iterating this process indefinitely he obtained one of the two P1 tilings with pentagonal symmetry.&lt;ref name="AMSa"/&gt;&lt;ref name="S:171"/&gt;

====Robinson triangle decompositions====
[[File:Robinson triangle decompositions.svg|left|thumb|Robinson triangles and their decompositions|alt=]]
The substitution method for both P2 and P3 tilings can be described using Robinson triangles of different sizes. The Robinson triangles arising in P2 tilings (by bisecting kites and darts) are called A-tiles, while those arising in the P3 tilings (by bisecting rhombs) are called B-tiles.&lt;ref name="GS-R"/&gt; The smaller A-tile, denoted A&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;, is an obtuse Robinson triangle, while the larger A-tile, A&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;, is acute; in contrast, a smaller B-tile, denoted B&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;, is an acute Robinson triangle, while the larger B-tile, B&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;, is obtuse.

Concretely, if A&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt; has side lengths (1, 1, {{φ}}), then A&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; has side lengths ({{φ}}, {{φ}}, 1). B-tiles can be related to such A-tiles in two ways:
* If B&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt; has the same size as A&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; then B&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; is an enlarged version {{φ}}A&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt; of A&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;, with side lengths ({{φ}}, {{φ}}, {{φ}}&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;{{φ}}) &amp;ndash; this decomposes into an A&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; tile and A&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt; tile joined along a common side of length 1.
* If instead B&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; is identified with A&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;, then B&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt; is a reduced version (1/{{φ}})A&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; of A&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; with side lengths (1/{{φ}},1/{{φ}},1) &amp;ndash; joining a B&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt; tile and a B&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; tile along a common side of length 1 then yields (a decomposition of) an A&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; tile.

In these decompositions, there appears to be an ambiguity: Robinson triangles may be decomposed in two ways, which are mirror images of each other in the (isosceles) axis of symmetry of the triangle. In a Penrose tiling, this choice is fixed by the matching rules &amp;ndash; furthermore, the matching rules ''also'' determine how the smaller triangles in the tiling compose to give larger ones.&lt;ref name="GS-R"/&gt;

{{multiple image|align=right|direction=vertical|image1=Penrose tilings P2 and P3.svg|image2=Penrose tilings P3 and P2.svg|width=200|footer=Partial inflation of star to yield rhombs, and of a collection of rhombs to yield an ace.}}
It follows that the P2 and P3 tilings are ''mutually locally derivable'': a tiling by one set of tiles can be used to generate a tiling by another &amp;ndash; for example a tiling by kites and darts may be subdivided into A-tiles, and these can be composed in a canonical way to form B-tiles and hence rhombs.&lt;ref name="S:173-174"/&gt; The P2 and P3 tilings are also both mutually locally derivable with the P1 tiling (see [[#Figure 2|figure 2 above]]).&lt;ref name="GS:546"&gt;{{Harvnb|Grünbaum|Shephard|1987|p=546}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The decomposition of B-tiles into A-tiles may be written
: B&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt; = A&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;, B&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; = A&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; + A&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;
(assuming the larger size convention for the B-tiles), which can be summarized in a ''substitution [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]]'' equation:&lt;ref name="S:157-158"&gt;{{Harvnb|Senechal|1996|pp=157&amp;ndash;158}}&lt;/ref&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix} B_L \\ B_S\end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 &amp; 1 \\ 1 &amp; 0 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} A_L \\ A_S \end{pmatrix}\, .&lt;/math&gt;
Combining this with the decomposition of enlarged {{φ}}A-tiles into B-tiles yields the substitution
: &lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix} \varphi A_L \\ \varphi A_S\end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 &amp; 1 \\ 1 &amp; 0 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} B_L \\ B_S\end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 2 &amp; 1 \\ 1 &amp; 1 \end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix} A_L \\ A_S \end{pmatrix}\, ,&lt;/math&gt;
so that the enlarged tile {{φ}}A&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; decomposes into two A&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; tiles and one A&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt; tiles. The matching rules force a particular substitution: the two A&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; tiles in a {{φ}}A&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; tile must form a kite &amp;ndash; thus a kite decomposes into two kites and a two half-darts, and a dart decomposes into a kite and two half-darts.&lt;ref name="AMSb"/&gt;&lt;ref name="S:183"&gt;{{Harvnb|Senechal|1996|p=183}}&lt;/ref&gt; Enlarged {{φ}}B-tiles decompose into B-tiles in a similar way (via {{φ}}A-tiles).

Composition and decomposition can be iterated, so that, for example
:&lt;math&gt;\varphi^n\begin{pmatrix} A_L \\ A_S\end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 2 &amp; 1 \\ 1 &amp; 1 \end{pmatrix}^n\begin{pmatrix} A_L \\ A_S \end{pmatrix}\, .&lt;/math&gt;
The number of kites and darts in the ''n''th iteration of the construction is determined by the ''n''th power of the substitution matrix:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix} 2 &amp; 1 \\ 1 &amp; 1 \end{pmatrix}^n = \begin{pmatrix} F_{2n+1} &amp; F_{2n} \\ F_{2n} &amp; F_{2n-1} \end{pmatrix}\, ,&lt;/math&gt;
where ''F''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is the ''n''th [[Fibonacci number]]. The ratio of numbers of kites to darts in any sufficiently large P2 Penrose tiling pattern therefore approximates to the golden ratio {{φ}}.&lt;ref name="G:7"&gt;{{Harvnb|Gardner|1997|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar result holds for the ratio of the number of thick rhombs to thin rhombs in the P3 Penrose tiling.&lt;ref name="AMSb"/&gt;

====Deflation for P2 and P3 tilings====

[[File:AnimSun2k.gif|thumb|Consecutive deflations of the 'sun' vertex in a Penrose [[tessellation|tiling]] of type P2]]
[[File:RectangleFill.gif|thumb|Consecutive deflations of a tile-set in a Penrose [[tessellation|tiling]] of type P2 filling a 16:9 wide rectangle]]
[[File:AnimSun 13.png|thumb|8th deflation of the 'sun' vertex in a Penrose [[tessellation|tiling]] of type P2]]

Starting with a collection of tiles from a given tiling (which might be a single tile, a tiling of the plane, or any other collection), deflation proceeds with a sequence of steps called generations. In one generation of deflation, each tile is replaced with two or more new tiles that are scaled-down versions of tiles used in the original tiling. The [[substitution tiling|substitution rules]] guarantee that the new tiles will be arranged in accordance with the matching rules.&lt;ref name="AMSb"/&gt; Repeated generations of deflation produce a tiling of the original axiom shape with smaller and smaller tiles. &lt;!--Given sufficiently many generations, the tiling will contain a scaled-down version of the axiom that does not touch the boundary of the tiling. The axiom can then be surrounded by full-size tiles corresponding to tiles that appear in the scaled-down version. This extended tiling can be used as a new axiom, producing larger and larger extended tilings and ultimately covers the entire plane.--&gt;
&lt;!--This is an example of successive generations of deflation starting from different axioms. In the case of the 'Sun' and 'Star', the scaled-down interior version of the axiom appears in generation 2. The 'Sun' also appears in the interior of its generation 3.--&gt;

This rule for dividing the tiles is a [[subdivision rule]].

====Consequences and applications====
Inflation and deflation yield a method for constructing kite and dart (P2) tilings, or rhombus (P3) tilings, known as ''up-down generation''.&lt;ref name="G:8"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AMSb"&gt;{{Harvnb|Austin|2005b}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="S:183"/&gt;

The Penrose tilings, being non-periodic, have no translational symmetry &amp;ndash; the pattern cannot be shifted to match itself over the entire plane. However, any bounded region, no matter how large, will be repeated an infinite number of times within the tiling. Therefore, a finite patch cannot differentiate between the uncountably many Penrose tilings, nor even determine which position within the tiling is being shown.&lt;ref&gt;"... any finite patch that we choose in a tiling will lie inside a single inflated tile if we continue moving far enough up in the inflation hierarchy. This means that anywhere that tile occurs at that level in the hierarchy, our original patch must also occur in the original tiling. Therefore, the patch will occur infinitely often in the original tiling and, in fact, in every other tiling as well." {{Harvnb|Austin|2005a}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This shows in particular that the number of distinct Penrose tilings (of any type) is [[uncountably infinite]]. Up-down generation yields one method to parameterize the tilings, but other methods use Ammann bars, pentagrids, or cut and project schemes.&lt;ref name="AMSb"/&gt;

===Decagonal coverings and quasicrystals===
[[File:Gummelt decagon.svg|300px|thumb|right|Gummelt's decagon (left) with the decomposition into kites and darts indicated by dashed lines; the thicker darker lines bound an inscribed ace and thick rhomb; possible overlaps (right) are by one or two red aces.&lt;ref name="LR"&gt;{{Harvnb|Lord|Ranganathan|2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;|alt=]]

In 1996, German mathematician Petra Gummelt demonstrated that a covering (so called to distinguish it from a non-overlapping tiling) equivalent to the Penrose tiling can be constructed using a single decagonal tile if two kinds of overlapping regions are allowed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gummelt|1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; The decagonal tile is decorated with colored patches, and the covering rule allows only those overlaps compatible with the coloring. A suitable decomposition of the decagonal tile into kites and darts transforms such a covering into a Penrose (P2) tiling. Similarly, a P3 tiling can be obtained by inscribing a thick rhomb into each decagon; the remaining space is filled by thin rhombs.

These coverings have been considered as a realistic model for the growth of [[quasicrystals]]: the overlapping decagons are 'quasi-unit cells' analogous to the [[unit cell]]s from which crystals are constructed, and the matching rules maximize the density of certain atomic clusters.&lt;ref name="LR"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Steinhardt|Jeong|1996}}; see also {{cite web|first=Paul J.|last=Steinhardt|title=A New Paradigm for the Structure of Quasicrystals|url=http://www.physics.princeton.edu/~steinh/quasi/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Related tilings===
[[File:Tie and Navette Tiling.png|300px|left|thumb|Tie and Navette tiling (in red on a Penrose background)]]
The three variants of the Penrose tiling are mutually locally derivable. Selecting some subsets from the vertices of a P1 tiling allows to produce other non-periodic tilings. If the corners of one pentagon in P1 are labeled in succession by ''1,3,5,2,4'' an unambiguous tagging in all the pentagons is established, the order being either clockwise or counterclockwise.
Points with the same label define a tiling by Robinson triangles while points with the numbers 3 and 4 on them define the vertices of a Tie-and-Navette tiling.&lt;ref&gt;Luck R., "Penrose Sublattices", ''Journal of Non Crystalline Solids'' 117-8 (90)832-5&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also other related unequivalent tilings, such as the hexagon-boat-star and Mikulla&amp;ndash;Roth tilings. For instance, if the matching rules for the rhombus tiling are reduced to a specific restriction on the angles permitted at each vertex, a binary tiling is obtained.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lançon|Billard|1988}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its underlying symmetry is also fivefold but it is not a quasicrystal. It can be obtained either by decorating the rhombs of the original tiling with smaller ones, or by applying substitution rules, but not by de Bruijn's cut-and-project method.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Godrèche|Lançon|1992}}; see also {{cite web|url=http://tilings.math.uni-bielefeld.de/substitution/binary|title=Binary|author= D.

The aesthetic value of tilings has long been appreciated, and remains a source of interest in them; here the visual appearance (rather than the formal defining properties) of Penrose tilings has attracted attention. The similarity with [[girih tiles|some decorative patterns]] used in the Middle East has been noted;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Zaslavskiĭ|Sagdeev|Usikov|Chernikov|1988}}; {{Harvnb|Makovicky|1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| first=Sebastian R. |last=Prange |author2=Peter J.

Art historian [[Martin Kemp (art historian)|Martin Kemp]] has observed that [[Albrecht Dürer]] sketched similar motifs of a rhombus tiling.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kemp|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Philip Herbert Cowell''' [[Fellow of the Royal Society|FRS]]&lt;ref name="Obituary-FRS" /&gt; (7 August 1870, [[Calcutta]] – 6 June 1949) was a British [[astronomer]].&lt;ref name="Obituary-MNRAS" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Obituary-The-Observatory" /&gt;&lt;ref name="PASP" /&gt;

Philip Herbert Cowell was born in Calcutta, India and educated at [[Eton College|Eton]] and [[Trinity College, Cambridge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{acad|id=CWL889PH|name=Cowell, Philip Herbert}}&lt;/ref&gt; He became second chief assistant at the [[Royal Greenwich Observatory]] in 1896 and later became the Superintendent of [[HM Nautical Almanac Office]] during 1910–1930. He worked on [[celestial mechanics]], and orbits of [[comet]]s and [[minor planet]]s in particular. He also carefully studied the discrepancy that then existed between the theory and observation of the position of the [[Moon]].

He was elected a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]] on 3 May 1906.&lt;ref name="Obituary-FRS" /&gt;&lt;ref name="FRS-list" /&gt; He won the [[Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society]] in 1911.

In 1909, he discovered [[4358 Lynn]], a 10-kilometer sized main-belt [[asteroid]] and member of the [[Eunomia family|Eunomia]].&lt;ref name="MPC-Lynn" /&gt;&lt;ref name="lcdb" /&gt;

In 1910, Cowell and Andrew Crommelin jointly received the [[Prix Jules Janssen]], the highest award of the [[Société astronomique de France]], the French astronomical society.

He died in Aldeburgh, Suffolk. The main-belt asteroid [[1898 Cowell]] is named after him.&lt;ref name="springer-1898-Cowell" /&gt;

{{short description|Cryptography that is secure against quantum computers}}
'''Post-quantum cryptography''' (sometimes referred to as '''quantum-proof''', '''quantum-safe''' or '''quantum-resistant''') refers to [[cryptographic primitive|cryptographic]] algorithms (usually [[public-key cryptosystem|public-key]] algorithms) that are thought to be secure against an attack by a [[Quantum computing|quantum computer]]. {{As of|2018}}, this is not true for the most popular public-key algorithms, which can be efficiently broken by a sufficiently strong hypothetical quantum computer. The problem with currently popular algorithms is that their security relies on one of three hard mathematical problems:  the [[integer factorization problem]], the [[discrete logarithm problem]] or the [[elliptic-curve discrete logarithm problem]]. All of these problems can be easily solved on a sufficiently powerful quantum computer running [[Shor's algorithm]].&lt;ref name=shor-algorithm&gt;{{cite journal |author=[[Peter W. Shor]] |date=1995-08-30 |title=Polynomial-Time Algorithms for Prime Factorization and Discrete Logarithms on a Quantum Computer |arxiv=quant-ph/9508027 |doi=10.1137/S0097539795293172 |volume=26 |journal=SIAM Journal on Computing |pages=1484–1509}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=djb-intro&gt;{{cite journal |author=[[Daniel J.

This work has gained greater attention from academics and industry through the PQCrypto [[academic conference|conference]] series since 2006 and more recently by several workshops on Quantum Safe Cryptography hosted by the [[ETSI|European Telecommunications Standards Institute]] (ETSI) and the [[Institute for Quantum Computing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=2009-01-01 |title=Cryptographers Take On Quantum Computers |url=http://spectrum.ieee.org/computing/software/cryptographers-take-on-quantum-computers |publisher=[[IEEE Spectrum]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ieee-jintai-ding&gt;{{cite news |date=2008-11-01 |title=Q&amp;A With Post-Quantum Computing Cryptography Researcher Jintai Ding |publisher=[[IEEE Spectrum]] |url=http://spectrum.ieee.org/computing/networks/qa-with-postquantum-computing-cryptography-researcher-jintai-ding }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.etsi.org/news-events/events/770-etsi-crypto-workshop-2014?highlight=YTozOntpOjA7czo3OiJxdWFudHVtIjtpOjE7czo0OiJzYWZlIjtpOjI7czoxMjoicXVhbnR1bSBzYWZlIjt9|title = ETSI Quantum Safe Cryptography Workshop|date = October 2014|accessdate = 24 February 2015|website = ETSI Quantum Safe Cryptography Workshop|publisher = ETSI|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast to the threat quantum computing poses to current public-key algorithms, most current [[symmetric cipher|symmetric cryptographic algorithms]] and [[hash function]]s are considered to be relatively secure against attacks by quantum computers.&lt;ref name=djb-intro /&gt;&lt;ref name=collisioncost&gt;{{cite journal |date=2009-05-17 |author=[[Daniel J. Bernstein]] |title=Cost analysis of hash collisions: Will quantum computers make SHARCS obsolete? |url=http://cr.yp.to/hash/collisioncost-20090823.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; While the quantum [[Grover's algorithm]] does speed up attacks against symmetric ciphers, doubling the key size can effectively block these attacks.&lt;ref name=djb-groverr&gt;{{cite journal |date=2010-03-03 |author=[[Daniel J. Bernstein]] |title=Grover vs. McEliece |url=http://cr.yp.to/codes/grovercode-20100303.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus post-quantum symmetric cryptography does not need to differ significantly from current symmetric cryptography. See section on symmetric-key approach below.

== Algorithms ==
Currently post-quantum cryptography research is mostly focused on six different approaches:&lt;ref name=djb-intro /&gt;&lt;ref name=ieee-jintai-ding /&gt;

=== Lattice-based cryptography ===
{{Main article|Lattice-based cryptography}}

This approach includes cryptographic systems such as [[learning with errors]], [[ring learning with errors]] ([[ideal lattice cryptography|ring-LWE]]),&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|last=Peikert|first=Chris|title=Lattice Cryptography for the Internet|url=http://eprint.iacr.org/2014/070.pdf|publisher=IACR|accessdate=10 May 2014|archiveurl=http://eprint.iacr.org|archivedate=31 January 2014|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Guneysu 2012"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://emsec.rub.de/media/sh/veroeffentlichungen/2014/06/12/lattice_signature.pdf|title=Practical Lattice-Based Cryptography: A Signature Scheme for Embedded Systems|last=Güneysu|first=Tim|last2=Lyubashevsky|first2=Vadim|last3=Pöppelmann|first3=Thomas|year=2012|publisher=INRIA|accessdate=12 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Zhang|first1=jiang|title=Authenticated Key Exchange from Ideal Lattices|url=http://eprint.iacr.org/2014/589.pdf|website=iacr.org|publisher=IACR|accessdate=7 September 2014|archiveurl=http://eprint.iacr.org/|archivedate=17 August 2014|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[ring learning with errors key exchange]] and the [[ring learning with errors signature]], the older [[NTRU]] or [[GGH encryption scheme|GGH]] encryption schemes, and the [[pqNTRUsign|newer NTRU signature]] and [[BLISS signature scheme|BLISS signatures]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Some of these schemes like NTRU encryption have been studied for many years without anyone finding a feasible attack. Others like the ring-LWE algorithms have proofs that their security reduces to a worst-case problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lyubashevsky|first=Vadim|title=On Ideal Lattices and Learning with Errors Over Rings|url=http://eprint.iacr.org/2012/230.pdf|publisher=IACR|accessdate=14 May 2013|author2==Peikert|author3= Regev|archiveurl=http://eprint.iacr.org|archivedate=22 July 2013|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Post Quantum Cryptography Study Group sponsored by the European Commission suggested that the Stehle–Steinfeld variant of NTRU be studied for standardization rather than the NTRU algorithm.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://pqcrypto.eu.org/docs/initial-recommendations.pdf|title = Initial recommendations of long-term secure post-quantum systems|date = 7 September 2015|accessdate = 13 September 2015|website = PQCRYPTO|publisher = |last = Augot|first = Daniel}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title = Making NTRUEncrypt and NTRUSign as Secure as Standard Worst-Case Problems over Ideal Lattices|url = http://eprint.iacr.org/2013/004|date = 2013-01-01|first = Damien|last = Stehlé|first2 = Ron|last2 = Steinfeld}}&lt;/ref&gt; At that time, NTRU was still patented.

=== Multivariate cryptography ===
{{Main article|Multivariate cryptography}}

This includes cryptographic systems such as the Rainbow ([[Unbalanced Oil and Vinegar]]) scheme which is based on the difficulty of solving systems of multivariate equations.  Various attempts to build secure multivariate equation encryption schemes have failed.  However, multivariate signature schemes like Rainbow could provide the basis for a quantum secure digital signature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ding|first=Jintai|author2=Schmidt|title=Rainbow, a New Multivariable Polynomial Signature Scheme|journal=Third International Conference, ACNS 2005, New York, NY, USA, June 7–10, 2005.

=== Hash-based cryptography ===

This includes cryptographic systems such as [[Lamport signature]]s and the [[Merkle signature scheme]] and the newer XMSS&lt;ref name="BuchmannDahmen2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Buchmann|first1=Johannes|last2=Dahmen|first2=Erik|last3=Hülsing|first3=Andreas|title=XMSS - A Practical Forward Secure Signature Scheme Based on Minimal Security Assumptions|journal=Lecture Notes in Computer Science|publisher=Springer Berlin Heidelberg|volume=7071|pages=117–129|issue=Post-Quantum Cryptography.

Hash based digital signatures were invented in the late 1970s by [[Ralph Merkle]] and have been studied ever since as an interesting alternative to number-theoretic digital signatures like RSA and DSA.  Their primary drawback is that for any hash-based public key, there is a limit on the number of signatures that can be signed using the corresponding set of private keys.  This fact had reduced interest in these signatures until interest was revived due to the desire for cryptography that was resistant to attack by quantum computers.  There appear to be no patents on the Merkle signature scheme{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}} and there exist many non-patented hash functions that could be used with these schemes. The stateful hash-based signature scheme XMSS is described in RFC 8391.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=RFC 8391 - XMSS: eXtended Merkle Signature Scheme|url=https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8391|website=tools.ietf.org|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Note that all the above schemes are one-time or bounded-time signatures, [[Moni Naor]] and [[Moti Yung]] invented [[UOWHF]] hashing in 1989 and designed a signature based on hashing (the Naor-Yung scheme)&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| title= Moni Naor, Moti Yung: Universal One-Way Hash Functions and their Cryptographic Applications .STOC 1989: 33-43}}&lt;/ref&gt;  which can be unlimited-time in use (the first such signature that does not require trapdoor properties).


=== Code-based cryptography ===
This includes cryptographic systems which rely on [[error-correcting code]]s, such as the [[McEliece cryptosystem|McEliece]] and [[Niederreiter cryptosystem|Niederreiter]] encryption algorithms and the related [[Niederreiter cryptosystem|Courtois, Finiasz and Sendrier Signature]] scheme. The original McEliece signature using random [[Binary Goppa code|Goppa codes]] has withstood scrutiny for over 30 years.  However, many variants of the McEliece scheme, which seek to introduce more structure into the code used in order to reduce the size of the keys, have been shown to be insecure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Overbeck|first=Raphael|author2=Sendrier|title=Code-based cryptography|journal=Post-Quantum Cryptography|date=2009|pages=95–145|doi=10.1007/978-3-540-88702-7_4|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-540-88702-7_4|accessdate=15 May 2014|editor1-first=Daniel|editor1-last=Bernstein|publisher=Springer Berlin Heidelberg}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Post Quantum Cryptography Study Group sponsored by the European Commission has recommended the McEliece public key encryption system as a candidate for long term protection against attacks by quantum computers.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

=== Supersingular elliptic curve isogeny cryptography ===
{{Main article|Supersingular isogeny key exchange}}

This cryptographic system relies on the properties of [[supersingular elliptic curve]]s and [[supersingular isogeny graph]]s to create a Diffie-Hellman replacement with [[forward secrecy]].&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite web|last=De Feo|first=Luca|title=Towards quantum-resistant cryptosystems from supersingular elliptic curve isogenies|url=http://eprint.iacr.org/2011/506.pdf|work=PQCrypto 2011|accessdate=14 May 2014|author2=Jao|author3= Plut|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This cryptographic system uses the well studied mathematics of supersingular elliptic curves to create a [[Diffie–Hellman key exchange|Diffie-Hellman]] like key exchange that can serve as a straightforward quantum computing resistant replacement for the Diffie-Hellman and [[elliptic curve Diffie–Hellman]] key exchange methods that are in widespread use today.  Because it works much like existing Diffie–Hellman implementations, it offers forward secrecy which is viewed as important both to prevent [[mass surveillance]] by governments but also to protect against the compromise of long term keys through failures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Higgins|first=Peter|title=Pushing for Perfect Forward Secrecy, an Important Web Privacy Protection|url=https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2013/08/pushing-perfect-forward-secrecy-important-web-privacy-protection|publisher=Electronic Frontier Foundation|accessdate=15 May 2014|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2012, researchers Sun, Tian and Wang of the Chinese State Key Lab for Integrated Service Networks and Xidian University, extended the work of De Feo, Jao, and Plut to create quantum secure digital signatures based on supersingular elliptic curve isogenies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sun|first1=Xi|author2=Tian|author3=Wang|title=Browse Conference Publications &gt; Intelligent Networking and Co …  Help Working with Abstracts Toward Quantum-Resistant Strong Designated Verifier Signature from Isogenies|journal=Intelligent Networking and Collaborative Systems (INCoS), 2012 4th International Conference on|date=19–21 Sep 2012|pages=292–296|doi=10.1109/iNCoS.2012.70|publisher=IEEE}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There are no patents covering this cryptographic system.

=== Symmetric key quantum resistance ===
Provided one uses sufficiently large key sizes, the symmetric key cryptographic systems like [[Advanced Encryption Standard|AES]] and [[SNOW|SNOW 3G]] are already resistant to attack by a quantum computer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Perlner|first=Ray|title=Quantum Resistant Public Key Cryptography: A Survey|url=https://www.nist.gov/manuscript-publication-search.cfm?pub_id=901595|publisher=NIST|accessdate=23 Apr 2015|author2=Cooper|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, key management systems and protocols that use symmetric key cryptography instead of public key cryptography like [[Kerberos (protocol)|Kerberos]] and the [[Network switching subsystem|3GPP Mobile Network Authentication Structure]] are also inherently secure against attack by a quantum computer.  Given its widespread deployment in the world already, some researchers recommend expanded use of Kerberos-like symmetric key management as an efficient and effective way to get Post Quantum cryptography today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Campagna|first=Matt|title=Kerberos Revisited Quantum-Safe Authentication|url=http://docbox.etsi.org/Workshop/2013/201309_CRYPTO/S03_INDUSTRY_SESSION/PITNEYBOWES_PINTSOV.pdf|publisher=ETSI|author2=Hardjono|author3= Pintsov|author4= Romansky|author5= Yu|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Security reductions ==
In cryptography research, it is desirable to prove the equivalence of a cryptographic algorithm and a known hard mathematical problem. These proofs are often called "security reductions", and are used to demonstrate the difficulty of cracking the encryption algorithm. In other words, the security of a given cryptographic algorithm is reduced to the security of a known hard problem.  Researchers are actively looking for security reductions in the prospects for post quantum cryptography.  Current results are given here:

=== Lattice-based cryptography – [[Ring learning with errors key exchange|Ring-LWE]] Signature ===
In some versions of [[Ring Learning with Errors|Ring-LWE]] there is a security reduction to the [[Lattice problem|shortest-vector problem (SVP)]] in a lattice as a lower bound on the security.  The SVP is known to be [[NP-hard]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lyubashevsky|first1=Vadim|author2=Peikert|author3=Regev|title=On Ideal Lattices and Learning with Errors Over Rings|url=https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~cpeikert/pubs/ideal-lwe.pdf|publisher=Springer|accessdate=19 June 2014|date=25 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specific ring-LWE systems that have provable security reductions include a variant of Lyubashevsky's ring-LWE signatures defined in a paper by Guneysu, Lyubashevsky, and Poppelmann.&lt;ref name="Guneysu 2012" /&gt;  The GLYPH signature scheme is a variant of the [[Ring learning with errors signature|Gunesyu, Lyubashevsky, and Poppelmann (GLP) signature]] which takes into account research results that have come after the publication of the GLP signature in 2012.  Another Ring-LWE signature is Ring-TESLA.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Akleylek|first=Sedat|last2=Bindel|first2=Nina|last3=Buchmann|first3=Johannes|last4=Krämer|first4=Juliane|last5=Marson|first5=Giorgia Azzurra|date=2016|title=An Efficient Lattice-Based Signature Scheme with Provably Secure Instantiation|url=https://eprint.iacr.org/2016/030}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Lattice-based cryptography – NTRU, BLISS ===
The security of the [[NTRUEncrypt|NTRU]] encryption scheme and the BLISS&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal|title = Lattice Signatures and Bimodal Gaussians|url = http://eprint.iacr.org/2013/383|date = 2013|access-date = 2015-04-18|first = Léo|last = Ducas|first2 = Alain|last2 = Durmus|first3 = Tancrède|last3 = Lepoint|first4 = Vadim|last4 = Lyubashevsky}}&lt;/ref&gt; signature is believed to be related to, but not provably reducible to, the [[Lattice problem#Closest vector problem .28CVP.29|Closest Vector Problem (CVP)]] in a Lattice.  The CVP is known to be [[NP-hard]]. The Post Quantum Cryptography Study Group sponsored by the European Commission suggested that the Stehle–Steinfeld variant of NTRU '''which does''' have a security reduction be studied for long term use instead of the original NTRU algorithm.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

=== [[Multivariate cryptography]] – Rainbow ===
The Rainbow Multivariate Equation Signature Scheme is a member of a class of multivariate quadratic equation cryptosystems called "Unbalanced Oil and Vinegar Cryptosystems" (UOV Cryptosystems)  Bulygin, Petzoldt and Buchmann have shown a reduction of generic multivariate quadratic UOV systems to the NP-Hard Multivariate Quadratic Equation Solving problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bulygin|first1=Stanislav|author2=Petzoldt|author3=Buchmann|title=Towards Provable Security of the Unbalanced Oil and Vinegar Signature Scheme under Direct Attacks|journal=Progress in Cryptology – INDOCRYPT 2010|date=2010|volume=6498|pages=17–32|series=Lecture Notes in Computer Science|publisher=Springer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== [[Hash-based cryptography]] – [[Merkle signature scheme]] ===
In 2005, Luis Garcia proved that there was a security reduction of [[Merkle Hash Tree]] signatures to the security of the underlying hash function. Garcia showed in his paper that if computationally one-way hash functions exist then the Merkle Hash Tree signature is provably secure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pereira|first1=Geovandro|last2=Puodzius| first2 =Cassius|last3 = Barreto|first3 = Paulo|title = Shorter hash-based signatures|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0164121215001466|website=ScienceDirect| publisher=Journal of Systems and Software|accessdate=5 May 2016|doi=10.1016/j.jss.2015.07.007|volume=116|pages=95–100}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Therefore, if one used a hash function with a provable reduction of security to a known hard problem one would have a provable security reduction of the [[Merkle tree]] signature to that known hard problem. &lt;ref&gt; {{cite web|last1 = Garcia|first1=Luis|title=On the security and the eﬃciency of the Merkle signature scheme|url=http://eprint.iacr.org/2005/192.pdf|website=Cryptology ePrint Archive|publisher=IACR|accessdate=19 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Post Quantum Cryptography Study Group]] sponsored by the [[European Commission]] has recommended use of Merkle signature scheme for long term security protection against quantum computers.&lt;ref name=":9"/&gt;

=== [[McEliece cryptosystem|Code-based cryptography – McEliece]] ===
The McEliece Encryption System has a security reduction to the Syndrome Decoding Problem (SDP). The SDP is known to be [[NP-hard]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Blaum|first1=Mario|author2=Farrell|author3=Tilborg|title=Information, Coding and Mathematics|date=31 May 2002|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-1-4757-3585-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Post Quantum Cryptography Study Group sponsored by the European Commission has recommended the use of this cryptography for long term protection against attack by a quantum computer.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

=== [[McEliece cryptosystem|Code-based cryptography – RLCE]] ===
In 2016, Wang proposed a random linear code encryption scheme RLCE
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wang|first=Yongge|title=Quantum resistant random linear code based public key encryption scheme RLCE|url=https://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.08454.pdf|journal=Proceedings of Information Theory (ISIT)|date=2016|pages=2519-2523|series=IEEE ISIT|publisher=IEEE}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is based on McEliece schemes. RLCE scheme can be constructed using any linear code such as Reed-Solomon code by inserting random columns in the underlying linear code generator matrix.

=== [[Supersingular isogeny key exchange|Supersingular elliptic curve isogeny cryptography]] ===
Security is related to the problem of constructing an isogeny between two supersingular curves with the same number of points.  The most recent investigation of the difficulty of this problem is by Delfs and Galbraith indicates that this problem is as hard as the inventors of the key exchange suggest that it is.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv|last1=Delfs|first1=Christina|author2=Galbraith|title=Computing isogenies between supersingular elliptic curves over F_p|arxiv=1310.7789}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There is no security reduction to a known NP-hard problem.

== Comparison ==
One common characteristic of many post-quantum cryptography algorithms is that they require larger key sizes than commonly used "pre-quantum" public key algorithms.  There are often tradeoffs to be made in key size, computational efficiency and ciphertext or signature size. The table lists some values for different schemes at a 128 bit post-quantum security level.

A practical consideration on a choice among post-quantum cryptographic algorithms is the effort required to send public keys over the internet. From this point of view, the Ring-LWE, NTRU, and SIDH algorithms provide key sizes conveniently under 1KB, hash-signature public keys come in under 5KB, and MDPC-based McEliece takes about 1KB.  On the other hand, Rainbow schemes require about 125KB and Goppa-based McEliece requires a nearly 1MB key.

=== Lattice-based cryptography – LWE key exchange and [[Ring learning with errors key exchange|Ring-LWE key exchange]] ===
The fundamental idea of using LWE and Ring LWE for key exchange was proposed and filed at the University of Cincinnati in 2011 by Jintai Ding. The basic idea comes from the associativity of matrix multiplications, and the errors are used to provide the security. The paper&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = A Simple Provably Secure Key Exchange Scheme Based on the Learning with Errors Problem|url = http://eprint.iacr.org/2012/688|date = 2012-01-01|first = Jintai Ding, Xiang Xie, Xiaodong|last = Lin}}&lt;/ref&gt; appeared in 2012 after a provisional patent application was filed in 2012.

In 2014, Peikert&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Lattice  Cryptography  for  the  Internet|url = http://eprint.iacr.org/2014/070|date = 2014-01-01|first = Chris|last = Peikert}}&lt;/ref&gt; presented a key transport scheme following the same basic idea of Ding's, where the new idea of sending additional 1 bit signal for rounding in Ding's construction is also utilized.  For somewhat greater than 128 [[bits of security]], Singh presents a set of parameters which have 6956-bit public keys for the Peikert's scheme.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal|title = A Practical Key Exchange for the Internet using Lattice Cryptography|url = http://eprint.iacr.org/2015/138|date = 2015|access-date = 2015-04-18|first = Vikram|last = Singh}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The corresponding private key would be roughly 14,000 bits.

In 2015, an authenticated key exchange with provable forward security following the same basic idea of Ding's was presented at Eurocrypt 2015,&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Authenticated Key Exchange from Ideal Lattices|url = https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-662-46803-6_24|publisher = Springer Berlin Heidelberg|date = 2015-04-26|isbn = 978-3-662-46802-9|pages = 719–751|series = Lecture Notes in Computer Science|first = Jiang|last = Zhang|first2 = Zhenfeng|last2 = Zhang|first3 = Jintai|last3 = Ding|first4 = Michael|last4 = Snook|first5 = Özgür|last5 = Dagdelen|editor-first = Elisabeth|editor-last = Oswald|editor-first2 = Marc|editor-last2 = Fischlin}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is an extension of the HMQV&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = HMQV: A High-Performance Secure Diffie-Hellman Protocol|url = https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/11535218_33|publisher = Springer Berlin Heidelberg|date = 2005-08-14|isbn = 978-3-540-28114-6|pages = 546–566|series = Lecture Notes in Computer Science|first = Hugo|last = Krawczyk|editor-first = Victor|editor-last = Shoup}}&lt;/ref&gt; construction in Crypto2005. The parameters for different security levels from 80 bits to 350 bits, along with the corresponding key sizes are provided in the paper.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

=== Lattice-based Cryptography – [[NTRUEncrypt|NTRU]] encryption ===
For 128 bits of security in NTRU, Hirschhorn, Hoffstein, Howgrave-Graham and Whyte, recommend using a public key represented as a degree 613 polynomial with coefficients &lt;math&gt;\bmod{\left(2^{10}\right)}&lt;/math&gt;.  This results in a public key of 6130 bits.  The corresponding private key would be 6743 bits.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{cite web|last=Hirschborrn|first=P|title=Choosing NTRUEncrypt Parameters in Light of Combined Lattice Reduction and MITM Approaches|url=https://www.securityinnovation.com/uploads/Crypto/params.pdf|publisher=NTRU|accessdate=12 May 2014|author2=Hoffstein|author3= Howgrave-Graham|author4= Whyte}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== [[Multivariate cryptography]] – Rainbow signature ===

For 128 bits of security and the smallest signature size in a Rainbow multivariate quadratic equation signature scheme, Petzoldt, Bulygin and Buchmann, recommend using equations in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{F}_{31}&lt;/math&gt; with a public key size of just over 991,000 bits, a private key of just over 740,000 bits and digital signatures which are 424 bits in length.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{cite web|last=Petzoldt|first=Albrecht|title=Selecting Parameters for the Rainbow Signature Scheme – Extended Version -|url=http://eprint.iacr.org/2010/437.pdf|accessdate=12 May 2014|author2=Bulygin|author3= Buchmann|archivedate=11 Aug 2010|archiveurl=http://eprint.iacr.org|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== [[Hash-based cryptography]] – [[Merkle signature scheme]] ===
In order to get 128 bits of security for hash based signatures to sign 1 million messages using the fractal Merkle tree method of Naor Shenhav and Wool the public and private key sizes are roughly 36,000 bits in length.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{cite web|last=Naor|first=Dalit|title=One-Time Signatures Revisited: Practical Fast Signatures Using Fractal Merkle Tree Traversal|url=http://www.eng.tau.ac.il/~yash/Naor_Shenhav_Wool.pdf|publisher=IEEE|accessdate=13 May 2014|author2=Shenhav|author3= Wool|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Code-based cryptography – [[McEliece cryptosystem|McEliece]] ===
For 128 bits of security in a McEliece scheme, The European Commissions Post Quantum Cryptography Study group recommends using a binary Goppa code of length at least &lt;math&gt;n=6960&lt;/math&gt; and dimension at least &lt;math&gt;k=5413&lt;/math&gt;, and capable of correcting &lt;math&gt;t=119&lt;/math&gt; errors.  With these parameters the public key for the McEliece system will be a systematic generator matrix whose non-identity part takes &lt;math&gt;k \times (n-k) = 8373911&lt;/math&gt; bits.  The corresponding private key, which consists of the code support with &lt;math&gt;n=6960&lt;/math&gt; elements from &lt;math&gt;GF(2^{13})&lt;/math&gt; and a generator polynomial of with &lt;math&gt;t=119&lt;/math&gt; coefficients from &lt;math&gt;GF(2^{13})&lt;/math&gt;, will be 92,027 bits in length&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

The group is also investigating the use of Quasi-cyclic MDPC codes of length at least &lt;math&gt;n=2^{16}+6 = 65542&lt;/math&gt; and dimension at least &lt;math&gt;k=2^{15}+3=32771&lt;/math&gt;, and capable of correcting &lt;math&gt;t=264&lt;/math&gt; errors.  With these parameters the public key for the McEliece system will be the first row of a systematic generator matrix whose non-identity part takes &lt;math&gt;k=32771&lt;/math&gt; bits.  The private key, a quasi-cyclic parity-check matrix with &lt;math&gt;d=274&lt;/math&gt; nonzero entries on a column (or twice as much on a row), takes no more than &lt;math&gt;d\times 16 = 4384&lt;/math&gt; bits when represented as the coordinates of the nonzero entries on the first row.

=== [[Supersingular isogeny key exchange|Supersingular elliptic curve isogeny cryptography]] ===

For 128 bits of security in the supersingular isogeny Diffie-Hellman (SIDH) method, De Feo, Jao and Plut recommend using a supersingular curve modulo a 768-bit prime. If one uses elliptic curve point compression the public key will need to be no more than 8x768 or 6144 bits in length.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=De Feo|first=Luca|title=Towards Quantum-Resistant Cryptosystems From Supersingular Elliptic Curve Isogenies|url=http://eprint.iacr.org/2011/506.pdf|accessdate=12 May 2014|author2=Jao|author3= Plut|archivedate= October 2011|archiveurl=http://eprint.iacr.org|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A March 2016 paper by authors Azarderakhsh, Jao, Kalach, Koziel, and Leonardi showed how to cut the number of bits transmitted in half, which was further improved by authors Costello, Jao, Longa, Naehrig, Renes and Urbanik resulting in a compressed-key version of the SIDH protocol with public keys only 2640 bits in size.&lt;ref name="SIDHcompressed" /&gt; This makes the number of bits transmitted roughly equivalent to the non-quantum secure RSA and Diffie-Hellman at the same classical security level.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://eprint.iacr.org/2016/229|title = Cryptology ePrint Archive: Report 2016/229|website = eprint.iacr.org|access-date = 2016-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Symmetric–key-based cryptography ===
As a general rule, for 128 bits of security in a symmetric-key-based system, one can safely use key sizes of 256 bits.  The best quantum attack against generic symmetric-key systems is an application of [[Grover's algorithm]], which requires work proportional to the square root of the size of the key space.  To transmit an encrypted key to a device that possesses the symmetric key necessary to decrypt that key requires roughly 256 bits as well.  It is clear that symmetric-key systems offer the smallest key sizes for post-quantum cryptography.

== Forward secrecy ==
A public-key system demonstrates a property referred to as perfect [[forward secrecy]] when it generates random public keys per session for the purposes of key agreement. This means that the compromise of one message cannot lead to the compromise of others, and also that there is not a single secret value which can lead to the compromise of multiple messages.  Security experts recommend using cryptographic algorithms that support forward secrecy over those that do not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ristic|first1=Ivan|title=Deploying Forward Secrecy|url=https://community.qualys.com/blogs/securitylabs/2013/06/25/ssl-labs-deploying-forward-secrecy|publisher=SSL Labs|accessdate=14 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reason for this is that forward secrecy can protect against the compromise of long term private keys associated with public/private key pairs.  This is viewed as a means of preventing mass surveillance by intelligence agencies.

Both the Ring-LWE key exchange and supersingular isogeny Diffie-Hellman (SIDH) key exchange can support forward secrecy in one exchange with the other party. Both the Ring-LWE and SIDH can also be used without forward secrecy by creating a variant of the classic [[ElGamal encryption]] variant of Diffie-Hellman.

The other algorithms in this article, such as NTRU, do not support forward secrecy as is.

Any authenticated public key encryption system can be used to build a key exchange with forward secrecy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://crypto.stackexchange.com/a/19115/12089|title=Does NTRU provide Perfect Forward Secrecy?|website=crypto.stackexchange.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implementation==
One of the main challenges in Post-quantum cryptography is considered to be the implementation of potentially quantum safe algorithms into existing systems. There are tests done, for example by [[Microsoft Research]] implementing PICNIC in a [[Public key infrastructure|PKI]] using [[Hardware security module|Hardware security modules]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://github.com/Microsoft/Picnic/blob/master/spec/design-v1.0.pdf|title=Microsoft/Picnic|website=GitHub|language=en|access-date=2018-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Test implementations for [[Google|Google's]] NewHope algorithm have also been done by [[Hardware security module|HSM]] vendors.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6859">In [[cryptography]], a '''pseudorandom function family''', abbreviated '''PRF''', is a collection of [[efficiently-computable]] [[Function (computer science)|functions]] which emulate a [[random oracle]] in the following way: no efficient algorithm can distinguish (with significant [[Advantage (cryptography)|advantage]]) between a function chosen randomly from the PRF family and a random oracle (a function whose outputs are fixed completely at random). Pseudorandom functions are vital tools in the construction of [[cryptographic primitive]]s, especially secure [[encryption|encryption schemes]].

Pseudorandom functions are not to be confused with [[pseudorandom generator]]s (PRGs). The guarantee of a PRG is that a ''single'' output appears [[random]] if the input was chosen at random. On the other hand, the guarantee of a PRF is that ''all its outputs'' appear random, regardless of how the corresponding inputs were chosen, as long as the ''function'' was drawn at random from the PRF family.

A pseudorandom function family can be constructed from any pseudorandom generator, using, for example, the "GGM" construction given by [[Oded Goldreich|Goldreich]], [[Shafi Goldwasser|Goldwasser]], and [[Silvio Micali|Micali]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Oded |last1=Goldreich |authorlink1=Oded Goldreich |first2=Shafi |last2=Goldwasser |authorlink2=Shafi Goldwasser |first3=Silvio |last3=Micali |authorlink3=Shafi Goldwasser |date=October 1986 |title=How to Construct Random Functions |journal=[[Journal of the ACM]] |volume=33 |issue=4, |pages=792&amp;ndash;807 |doi=10.1145/6490.6503 |url=http://groups.csail.mit.edu/cis/pubs/shafi/1986-jacm.pdf}}  [http://www.wisdom.weizmann.ac.il/~oded/ggm.html web page and preprint]&lt;/ref&gt;. While in practice, [[block ciphers]] are used in most instances where a pseudorandom function is needed, they do not, in general, constitute a pseudorandom function family, as block ciphers such as [[Advanced Encryption Standard|AES]] are defined for only limited numbers of input and key sizes.&lt;ref name="intromodern"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lindell|first1=Yehuda|last2=Katz|first2=Jonathan|title=Introduction to Modern Cryptography|date=2008|publisher=Chapman &amp; Hall/CRC|isbn=978-1-58488-551-1|page=88|ref=intromodern}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Motivations from random functions==

A PRF is an efficient (i.e. computable in polynomial time), deterministic function that maps two distinct sets (domain and range) and looks like a truly random function.

Essentially, a truly random function would just be composed of a lookup table filled with uniformly distributed random entries. However, in practice, a PRF is given an input string in the domain and a hidden random seed and runs multiple times with the same input string and seed, always returning the same value. Nonetheless, given an arbitrary input string, the output looks random if the seed is taken from a uniform distribution.

A PRF is considered to be good if its behavior is indistinguishable from a truly random function. Therefore, given an output from either the truly random function or a PRF, there should be no efficient method to correctly determine whether the output was produced by the truly random function or the PRF.

==Formal definition==
A family of functions, 

: ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt; : {0, 1}&lt;sup&gt;λ(|''s''|)&lt;/sup&gt; → {0, 1}&lt;sup&gt;λ(|''s''|)&lt;/sup&gt;, where ''s'' ∈ {0, 1}&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;, and λ : ℕ → ℕ,

is '''pseudorandom''' if the following conditions are satisfied:

* Given any ''s'' and ''x'' such that |''x''| = λ(|''s''|), there always exists a polynomial-time algorithm to compute ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'').
* Let ''F''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; be the distribution of functions ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt; where ''s'' is uniformly distributed over {0, 1}&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;, and let ''RF''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; denote the uniform distribution over the set of all functions from {0, 1}&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; to {0, 1}&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;. Then we require ''F''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''RF''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; are computationally indistinguishable, where ''n'' is the security parameter. That is, for any adversary that can query the oracle of a function sampled from either ''F''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; or ''RF''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, the advantage that she can tell apart which kind of oracle is given to her is negligible. &lt;ref&gt;Goldreich's FoC, vol. 1, def. 3.6.4. Pass's notes, def. 96.2&lt;/ref&gt;

==Oblivious pseudorandom functions==
In an oblivious pseudorandom function, information is concealed from two parties that are involved in a PRF.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |author1=M. Bellare |authorlink1=Mihir Bellare |author2=S. Keelveedhi |author3=T.

This enables transactions of sensitive cryptographic information to be secure even between untrusted parties.

In [[mathematics]], a '''reflection formula''' or '''reflection relation''' for a [[function (mathematics)|function]] ''f'' is a relationship between ''f''(''a''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''x'') and ''f''(''x'').  It is a special case of a [[functional equation]], and it is very common in the literature to use the term "functional equation" when "reflection formula" is meant.

Reflection formulas are useful for [[numerical analysis|numerical computation]] of [[special function]]s. In effect, an approximation that has greater accuracy or only converges on one side of a reflection point (typically in the positive half of the [[complex plane]]) can be employed for all arguments.

== Known formula ==
The [[even and odd functions]] satisfy simple reflection relations around ''a''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0. For all even functions,

:&lt;math&gt;f(-x) = f(x),&lt;/math&gt;

and for all odd functions,

:&lt;math&gt;f(-x) = -f(x).&lt;/math&gt;

A famous relationship is '''Euler's reflection formula'''

:&lt;math&gt;\Gamma(z)\Gamma(1-z) = \frac{\pi}{\sin{(\pi z)}}, \qquad z \not\in \mathbb Z&lt;/math&gt;

for the [[Gamma function]] &lt;math&gt;\Gamma(z)&lt;/math&gt;, due to [[Leonhard Euler]].

There is also a reflection formula for the general ''n''-th order [[polygamma function]] &amp;psi;&lt;sup&gt;(n)&lt;/sup&gt;(''z''),

:&lt;math&gt;\psi^{(n)} (1-z)+(-1)^{n+1}\psi^{(n)} (z) = (-1)^n \pi \frac{d^n}{d z^n} \cot{(\pi z)} &lt;/math&gt;

which springs trivially from the fact that the polygamma functions are defined as the derivatives of &lt;math&gt;\ln \Gamma&lt;/math&gt; and thus inherit the reflection formula.

The [[Riemann zeta function]] &amp;zeta;(''z'') satisfies

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\zeta(1-z)}{\zeta(z)} = \frac{2\, \Gamma(z)}{(2\pi)^{z}} \cos\left(\frac{\pi z}{2}\right),&lt;/math&gt;

and the [[Riemann Xi function]] &amp;xi;(''z'') satisfies

:&lt;math&gt;\xi(z) = \xi(1-z). &lt;/math&gt;

In [[functional analysis]] and related areas of [[mathematics]], a '''sequence space''' is a [[vector space]] whose elements are infinite [[sequence]]s of [[real number|real]] or [[complex numbers]]. Equivalently, it is a [[function space]] whose elements are functions from the [[natural numbers]] to the field '''K''' of real or complex numbers.  The set of all such functions is naturally  identified with the set of all possible [[infinite sequence]]s with elements in '''K''', and can be turned into a [[vector space]] under the operations of [[pointwise addition]] of functions and pointwise scalar multiplication. All sequence spaces are [[linear subspace]]s of this space.  Sequence spaces are typically equipped with a [[norm (mathematics)|norm]], or at least the structure of a [[topological vector space]].

The most important sequence spaces in analysis are the ℓ&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt; spaces, consisting of the ''p''-power summable sequences, with the ''p''-norm.  These are special cases of [[Lp space|L&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt; spaces]] for the [[counting measure]] on the set of natural numbers.  Other important classes of sequences like [[convergent sequence]]s or [[Sequence space#c, c0 and c00|null sequences]] form sequence spaces, respectively denoted ''c'' and ''c''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, with the [[Supremum norm|sup norm]]. Any sequence space can also be equipped with the [[topology]] of [[pointwise convergence]], under which it becomes a special kind of [[Fréchet space]] called [[FK-space]].

==Definition==

Let '''K''' denote the field either of real or complex numbers.  Denote by '''K'''&lt;sup&gt;'''N'''&lt;/sup&gt; the set of all sequences of scalars
:&lt;math&gt;(x_n)_{n\in\mathbf{N}},\quad x_n\in\mathbf{K}.&lt;/math&gt;
This can be turned into a [[vector space]] by defining [[vector addition]] as
:&lt;math&gt;(x_n)_{n\in\mathbf{N}} + (y_n)_{n\in\mathbf{N}} \stackrel{\rm{def}}{=} (x_n + y_n)_{n\in\mathbf{N}}&lt;/math&gt;
and the [[scalar multiplication]] as
:&lt;math&gt;\alpha(x_n)_{n\in\mathbf{N}} := (\alpha x_n)_{n\in\mathbf{N}}.&lt;/math&gt;
A '''sequence space''' is any linear subspace of '''K'''&lt;sup&gt;'''N'''&lt;/sup&gt;.

=== ℓ&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt; spaces===
{{see also|Lp space{{!}}L&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt; space|L-infinity}}
For 0 &lt; ''p'' &lt; ∞, ℓ&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt; is the subspace of '''K'''&lt;sup&gt;'''N'''&lt;/sup&gt; consisting of all sequences ''x'' = ('''x'''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) satisfying
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_n |x_n|^p &lt; \infty.&lt;/math&gt;
If ''p'' ≥ 1, then the real-valued operation &lt;math&gt;\|\cdot\|_p&lt;/math&gt; defined by
:&lt;math&gt;\|x\|_p = \left(\sum_n|x_n|^p\right)^{1/p}&lt;/math&gt;
defines a [[norm (mathematics)|norm]] on ℓ&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt;.  In fact, ℓ&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt; is a [[complete metric space]] with respect to this norm, and therefore is a [[Banach space]].

If 0 &lt; ''p'' &lt; 1, then ℓ&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt; does not carry a norm, but rather a [[metric space|metric]] defined by
:&lt;math&gt;d(x,y) = \sum_n |x_n-y_n|^p.\,&lt;/math&gt;

If ''p'' = ∞, then ℓ&lt;sup&gt;∞&lt;/sup&gt; is defined to be the space of all bounded sequences.  With respect to the norm
:&lt;math&gt;\|x\|_\infty = \sup_n |x_n|,&lt;/math&gt;
ℓ&lt;sup&gt;∞&lt;/sup&gt; is also a Banach space.

===''c'', ''c''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and  ''c''&lt;sub&gt;00&lt;/sub&gt;===
The space of [[Limit of a sequence|convergent sequence]]s ''c'' is a sequence space.  This consists of all ''x''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;'''K'''&lt;sup&gt;'''N'''&lt;/sup&gt; such that lim&lt;sub&gt;''n''→∞&lt;/sub&gt;''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; exists.  Since every convergent sequence is bounded, ''c'' is a linear subspace of ℓ&lt;sup&gt;∞&lt;/sup&gt;.  It is, moreover, a closed subspace with respect to the infinity norm, and so a Banach space in its own right.

The subspace of null sequences ''c''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; consists of all sequences whose limit is zero.  This is a closed subspace of ''c'', and so again a Banach space.

The subspace of eventually zero sequences ''c''&lt;sub&gt;00&lt;/sub&gt; consists of all sequences which have only finitely many nonzero elements. This is not a closed subspace and therefore is not a Banach space with respect to the infinity norm. For example, the sequence (''x''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;) where ''x''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; has 1/k for the first n entries and is zero everywhere else (i.e. ''x''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; = (1, 1/2, ..., 1/n, 0, ...)) is Cauchy w.r.t. infinity norm but not convergent (to a sequence in ''c''&lt;sub&gt;00&lt;/sub&gt;).

===Other sequence spaces===
The space of bounded [[series (mathematics)|series]], denote by [[Bs_space|bs]], is the space of sequences ''x'' for which
:&lt;math&gt;\sup_n \left\vert \sum_{i=0}^n x_i \right\vert &lt; \infty.&lt;/math&gt;
This space, when equipped with the norm
:&lt;math&gt;\|x\|_{bs} = \sup_n \left\vert \sum_{i=0}^n x_i \right\vert,&lt;/math&gt;
is a Banach space isometrically isomorphic to ℓ&lt;sup&gt;∞&lt;/sup&gt;, via the linear mapping
:&lt;math&gt;(x_n)_{n\in\mathbf{N}} \mapsto \left(\sum_{i=0}^n x_i\right)_{n\in\mathbf{N}}.&lt;/math&gt;
The subspace ''cs'' consisting of all convergent series is a subspace that goes over to the space ''c'' under this isomorphism.

The space Φ or &lt;math&gt;c_{00}&lt;/math&gt; is defined to be the space of all infinite sequences with only a finite number of non-zero terms (sequences with [[finite support]]).  This set is [[dense set|dense]] in many sequence spaces.

== Properties of ℓ&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt; spaces and the space ''c''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; ==
{{see also|c space}}
The space ℓ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is the only ℓ&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt; space that is a [[Hilbert space]], since any norm that is induced by an inner product should satisfy the [[parallelogram law]]

:&lt;math&gt;\|x+y\|_p^2 + \|x-y\|_p^2= 2\|x\|_p^2 + 2\|y\|_p^2.&lt;/math&gt;

Substituting two distinct unit vectors for ''x'' and ''y'' directly shows that the identity is not true unless ''p''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2.

Each ℓ&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt; is distinct, in that ℓ&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt; is a strict subset of ℓ&lt;sup&gt;''s''&lt;/sup&gt; whenever ''p''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''s''; furthermore, ℓ&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt; is not linearly [[isomorphic]] to ℓ&lt;sup&gt;''s''&lt;/sup&gt; when&amp;nbsp;''p''&amp;nbsp;≠&amp;nbsp;''s''.  In fact, by Pitt's theorem {{harv|Pitt|1936}}, every bounded linear operator from ℓ&lt;sup&gt;''s''&lt;/sup&gt; to ℓ&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt; is [[Compact operator|compact]] when ''p''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''s''.  No such operator can be an isomorphism; and further, it cannot be an isomorphism on any infinite-dimensional subspace of ℓ&lt;sup&gt;''s''&lt;/sup&gt;, and is thus said to be [[strictly singular]].

If 1&amp;nbsp;&lt; ''p''&amp;nbsp;&lt; ∞, then the [[dual space|(continuous) dual space]] of ℓ&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt; is isometrically isomorphic to ℓ&lt;sup&gt;''q''&lt;/sup&gt;, where ''q'' is the [[Hölder conjugate]] of ''p'': 1/''p''&amp;nbsp;+ 1/''q''&amp;nbsp;= 1.  The specific isomorphism associates to an element ''x'' of ℓ&lt;sup&gt;''q''&lt;/sup&gt; the functional
:&lt;math&gt;L_x(y) = \sum_n x_ny_n&lt;/math&gt;
for ''y'' in ℓ&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt;.  [[Hölder's inequality]] implies that ''L''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt; is a bounded linear functional on ℓ&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt;, and in fact
:&lt;math&gt;|L_x(y)| \le \|x\|_q\,\|y\|_p&lt;/math&gt;
so that the operator norm satisfies
:&lt;math&gt;\|L_x\|_{(\ell^p)^*} \stackrel{\rm{def}}{=}\sup_{y\in\ell^p, y\not=0} \frac{|L_x(y)|}{\|y\|_p} \le \|x\|_q.&lt;/math&gt;
In fact, taking ''y'' to be the element of ℓ&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt; with
:&lt;math&gt;y_n = \begin{cases}0&amp;\rm{if}\ x_n=0\\
x_n^{-1}|x_n|^q &amp;\rm{if}\ x_n\not=0
\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;
gives ''L''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;(''y'') = ||''x''||&lt;sub&gt;''q''&lt;/sub&gt;, so that in fact
:&lt;math&gt;\|L_x\|_{(\ell^p)^*} = \|x\|_q.&lt;/math&gt;
Conversely, given a bounded linear functional ''L'' on ℓ&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt;, the sequence defined by ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;= ''L''(''e''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) lies in ℓ&lt;sup&gt;''q''&lt;/sup&gt;.  Thus the mapping &lt;math&gt;x\mapsto L_x&lt;/math&gt; gives an isometry
:&lt;math&gt;\kappa_q : \ell^q \to (\ell^p)^*.&lt;/math&gt;

The map
:&lt;math&gt;\ell^q\xrightarrow{\kappa_q}(\ell^p)^*\xrightarrow{(\kappa_q^*)^{-1}}&lt;/math&gt;
obtained by composing κ&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt; with the inverse of its [[Dual space#Transpose of a continuous linear map|transpose]] coincides with the [[Reflexive space#Definitions|canonical injection]] of ℓ&lt;sup&gt;''q''&lt;/sup&gt; into its [[double dual]].  As a consequence ℓ&lt;sup&gt;''q''&lt;/sup&gt; is a [[reflexive space]]. By [[abuse of notation]], it is typical to identify ℓ&lt;sup&gt;''q''&lt;/sup&gt; with the dual of ℓ&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt;: (ℓ&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;= ℓ&lt;sup&gt;''q''&lt;/sup&gt;.  Then reflexivity is understood by the sequence of identifications (ℓ&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;**&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;= (ℓ&lt;sup&gt;''q''&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;= ℓ&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt;.

The space ''c''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is defined as the space of all sequences converging to zero, with norm identical to  ||''x''||&lt;sub&gt;∞&lt;/sub&gt;. It is a closed subspace of ℓ&lt;sup&gt;∞&lt;/sup&gt;, hence a Banach space. The [[dual space|dual]] of ''c''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is ℓ&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;; the dual of ℓ&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; is ℓ&lt;sup&gt;∞&lt;/sup&gt;. For the case of natural numbers index set, the ℓ&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt; and ''c''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; are [[separable space|separable]], with the sole exception of ℓ&lt;sup&gt;∞&lt;/sup&gt;.  The dual of ℓ&lt;sup&gt;∞&lt;/sup&gt; is the [[ba space]].

The spaces ''c''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and ℓ&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt; (for 1&amp;nbsp;≤ ''p''&amp;nbsp;&lt; ∞) have a canonical unconditional [[Schauder basis]] {''e''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;| ''i''&amp;nbsp;= 1, 2,…}, where ''e''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; is the sequence which is zero but for a 1 in the ''i''&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; entry.

The space ℓ&lt;sup&gt;''1''&lt;/sup&gt; has the [[Schur's property|Schur property]]: In ℓ&lt;sup&gt;''1''&lt;/sup&gt;, any sequence that is [[weak convergence (Hilbert space)|weakly convergent]] is also [[Weak convergence (Hilbert space)|strongly convergent]] {{harv|Schur|1921}}.  However, since the [[weak topology]] on infinite-dimensional spaces is strictly weaker than the [[strong topology]], there are [[net (mathematics)|nets]] in ℓ&lt;sup&gt;''1''&lt;/sup&gt; that are weak convergent but not strong convergent.

The ℓ&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt; spaces can be [[embedding|embedded]] into many [[Banach space]]s. The question of whether every infinite-dimensional Banach space contains an isomorph of some ℓ&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt; or of ''c''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, was answered negatively by [[Boris Tsirelson|B. S. Tsirelson]]'s construction of [[Tsirelson space]] in 1974.  The dual statement, that every separable Banach space is linearly isometric to a [[quotient space (linear algebra)|quotient space]] of ℓ&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;, was answered in the affirmative by {{harvtxt|Banach|Mazur|1933}}. That is, for every separable Banach space ''X'', there exists a quotient map &lt;math&gt;Q:\ell^1 \to X&lt;/math&gt;, so that ''X'' is isomorphic to &lt;math&gt;\ell^1 / \ker Q&lt;/math&gt;.  In general, ker ''Q'' is not complemented in ℓ&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;, that is, there does not exist a subspace ''Y'' of ℓ&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\ell^1 = Y \oplus \ker Q&lt;/math&gt;. In fact, ℓ&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; has uncountably many uncomplemented subspaces that are not isomorphic to one another (for example, take &lt;math&gt;X=\ell^p&lt;/math&gt;; since there are uncountably many such ''X'' 's, and since no ℓ&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt; is isomorphic to any other, there are thus uncountably many ker ''Q'' 's).

Except for the trivial finite-dimensional case, an unusual feature of ℓ&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt; is that it is not [[polynomially reflexive space|polynomially reflexive]].

=== ℓ&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt; spaces are increasing in ''p'' ===
For &lt;math&gt;p\in[1,+\infty]&lt;/math&gt;, the spaces &lt;math&gt;\ell^p&lt;/math&gt; are increasing in &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;, with the inclusion operator being continuous: for &lt;math&gt;1\le p&lt;q\le+\infty&lt;/math&gt;, one has &lt;math&gt;\|f\|_q\le\|f\|_p&lt;/math&gt;.  

This follows from defining &lt;math&gt;F:=\frac{f}{\|f\|_p}&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;f\in\ell^p&lt;/math&gt;, and noting that &lt;math&gt;|F(m)|\le1&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;m\in\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt;, which can be shown to imply &lt;math&gt;\|F\|_q^q\le1&lt;/math&gt;.

[[File:Set-point control.png|thumb|300px|Block diagram of a [[Negative feedback|negative feedback system]] used to maintain a setpoint in the face of a disturbance using error-controlled regulation. Positive error means feedback is too small (controller calls for an increase), and negative error means feedback is too large (controller calls for a decrease).]]
In [[cybernetics]] and [[control theory]], a '''setpoint''' (also '''set point''' or '''set-point''') is the desired or target value for an essential variable, or process value of a system.&lt;ref name=Achterbergh/&gt; Departure of such a variable from its setpoint is one basis for error-controlled regulation using negative [[feedback]] for automatic control. &lt;ref name=Ashby/&gt;.  The set point is usually abbreviated to SP, and the process value is usually abbreviated to PV.&lt;ref name= Bequette/&gt;

==Examples==

'''Cruise control'''

The SP-PV error can be used to return a system to its norm. An everyday example is the [[cruise control]] on a road vehicle; where external influences such as gradients cause speed changes (PV), and the driver also alters the desired set speed (SP). The automatic control algorithm restores the actual speed to the desired speed in the optimum way, without delay or overshoot, by altering the power output of the vehicle's engine.  In this way the SP-PV error is used to control the PV so that it equals the SP. A widespread use of SP-PV error control is the [[PID controller]].

'''Industrial applications'''

Special consideration must be given for engineering applications. In industrial systems, physical or process restraints may limit the determined set point. For example, a reactor which operates more efficiently at higher temperatures may be rated to withstand 500°C. However, for safety reasons, the set point for the reactor temperature control loop would be well below this limit, even if this means the reactor is running less efficiently.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17931">In [[psychology]], a '''social trap''' is a situation in which a group of people act to obtain short-term individual gains, which in the long run leads to a loss for the group as a whole. Examples of social traps include [[overfishing]], energy "brownout" and "blackout" [[power outage]]s during periods of extreme temperatures, the [[overgrazing]] of cattle on the [[Sahel]]ian Desert, and the destruction of the [[rainforest]] by [[logging]] interests and [[agriculture]].{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

== Origin of the concept ==

The term ''social trap'' was first introduced to the scientific community by John Platt's 1973 paper in ''[[American Psychologist]]'',&lt;ref name="Platt1973"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Platt |first=J. |year=1973 |title=Social Traps |journal=American Psychologist |volume=28 |issue=8 |pages=641–651 |doi=10.1037/h0035723 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in a book developed in an interdisciplinary symposium held at the [[University of Michigan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Cross |first=J. G. |lastauthoramp=yes |first2=M. J. |last2=Guyer |year=1980 |title=Social Traps |location=Ann Arbor |publisher=University of Michigan Press |isbn=0-472-06315-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Building upon the concept of the "[[tragedy of the commons]]" in [[Garrett Hardin]]'s pivotal article in ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' (1968),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Hardin |first=G. |year=1968 |title=The Tragedy of the Commons |journal=Science |volume=162 |issue=3859 |pages=1243–1248 |doi=10.1126/science.162.3859.1243 |pmid=5699198}}&lt;/ref&gt; Platt and others in the seminar applied behavioral [[psychology]] concepts to actions of people operating in social traps.  By applying the findings of basic research on "schedules of operant reinforcement" ([[B.F. Skinner]] 1938, 1948, 1953, 1957; Keller and Schoenfeld, 1950), Platt recognized that individuals operating for short-term positive gain ("[[reinforcement]]") had a tendency to [[over-exploit]] a resource, which led to a long-term overall loss to society.

The application of behavioral psychology terms to behaviors in the tragedy of the commons led to the realization that the same short-term/long-term cause-effect relationship also applied to other human traps, in addition to the exploitation of commonly held resources. Platt et al. also introduced the terms ''social fence'' and ''individual trap''. ''Social fence'' refers to a short-term avoidance behavior by individuals that leads to a long-term loss to the entire group.&lt;ref name="Platt1973" /&gt; An example is the anecdote of a mattress that falls from a vehicle on a two lane highway. Motorists tend to back up in a traffic jam behind the mattress, waiting for a break in the oncoming traffic to pass around the mattress. Each individual motorist avoids the opportunity to exit their stopped car and pull the mattress to the side of the road. The long-term consequence of this avoidance behavior is that all of the motorists (except for perhaps one) arrived at their destinations later than they would have if an individual had removed the mattress barrier.

An individual trap is similar to a social trap except that it involves the behavior of only a single person rather than a group of people.  The basic concept is that an individual's behavior for short-term reinforcers leads to a long-term loss for the individual.  Examples of individual traps are [[tobacco smoking]] leading to [[lung cancer]] or [[alcohol]] ingestion leading to [[cirrhosis]] of the liver.

== First empirical test and the use of superimposed schedules of reinforcement ==
The first empirical test of the concept of social traps was by Brechner at [[Arizona State University]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Brechner |first=K. C. |year=1974 |title=An experimental analysis of social traps: A laboratory analog |others=Ph.D. Dissertation |location= |publisher=Arizona State University }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Brechner |first=K. C. |year=1977 |title=An experimental analysis of social traps |journal=Journal of Experimental Social Psychology |volume=13 |issue=6 |pages=552–564 |doi=10.1016/0022-1031(77)90054-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; who [[Operationalization|operationalized]] the concepts underlying Platt et al.'s theoretical analysis. By creating a laboratory game, Brechner had groups of college students playing a game where they could accumulate points by pressing buttons for the individual short-term positive rewards of experimental credit in their introductory psychology classes. Players could see a lighted display that indicated the total quantity of points available at any given time in the experiment. Players were told that if they completely drained the pool of points, the game was over and they could not accumulate more points. By responding for points at a moderate rate all the players in the group could accumulate enough points to fulfill their entire semester's experimental requirements. But if one or more players took points for themselves at too fast a rate, the pool would be drained of points and none of the players would achieve the maximum potential experimental credit.

In building the laboratory analogy of social traps, Brechner introduced the concept of "[[superimposed schedules of reinforcement]]".  [[B.F. Skinner|Skinner]] and Ferster (1957)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Skinner |first=B. F. |first2=C. B. |last2=Ferster |year=1957 |title=Schedules of Reinforcement |isbn=0-13-792309-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; had demonstrated that reinforcers could be delivered on schedules ([[reinforcement#Schedules|schedule of reinforcement]]), and further that organisms behaved differently under different schedules.  Rather than a reinforcer, such as food or water, being delivered every time as a consequence of some behavior, a reinforcer could be delivered after more than one instance of the behavior.  For example, a [[pigeon]] may be required to peck a button switch five times before food is made available to the pigeon.  This is called a "ratio schedule".  Also, a reinforcer could be delivered after an interval of time passed following a target behavior.  An example is a [[rat]] that is given a food pellet one minute after the rat pressed a lever. This is called an "interval schedule".  In addition, ratio schedules can deliver reinforcement following fixed or variable number of behaviors by the individual organism. Likewise, interval schedules can deliver reinforcement following fixed or variable intervals of time following a single response by the organism.  Individual behaviors tend to generate response rates that differ based upon how the reinforcement schedule is created. Much subsequent research in many labs examined the effects on behaviors of scheduling reinforcers.

When an organism is offered the opportunity to choose between or among two or more simple schedules of reinforcement at the same time, the reinforcement structures are called "[[concurrent schedules of reinforcement]]".  In creating the laboratory analogy of social traps, Brechner created a situation where simple reinforcement schedules were superimposed upon each other.  In other words, a single response or group of responses by an organism led to multiple consequences. Concurrent schedules of reinforcement can be thought of as "or" schedules, and [[superimposed schedules of reinforcement]] can be thought of as "and" schedules.

To simulate social traps a short-term positive reward is superimposed upon a long-term negative consequence.  In the specific experiment, the short-term positive reinforcer was earning points that applied to class credits.  The long-term negative consequence was that each point earned by a player also drained the pool of available points.  Responding too rapidly for short-term gains led to the long-term loss of draining the resource pool. What makes the traps social is that any individual can respond in a way that the long-term consequence also comes to bear on the other individuals in the environment.

Superimposed schedules of reinforcement have many real-world applications in addition to generating social traps (Brechner and Linder, 1981; Brechner, 1987; Brechner, 2010). Many different human individual and social situations can be created by superimposing simple reinforcement schedules. For example, a human being could have simultaneous tobacco and alcohol addictions.  Even more complex situations can be created or simulated by superimposing two or more concurrent schedules. For example, a high school senior could have a choice between going to Stanford University or UCLA, and at the same time have the choice of going into the Army or the Air Force, and simultaneously the choice of taking a job with an internet company or a job with a software company. That would be a reinforcement structure of three superimposed concurrent schedules of reinforcement. An example of the use of superimposed schedules as a tool in the analysis of the contingencies of rent control can be found online in the website "Economic and Game Theory Forum", (Brechner, 2003).

== Subsequent experimentation ==
Subsequent empirical studies by other researchers explored aspects of social traps other than the underlying reinforcement structure. Studies tended to concentrate on manipulating social and cognitive variables.  Cass and Edney (1978) created a simpler game using a bowl of nuts to simulate a commonly held resource.  The Nuts Game as they called it had some distinct advantages over Brechner's electronically wired laboratory simulation.  The Nuts Game could be transported easily to any environment in or out of the laboratory.  It was simple and required no electronics.  The reinforcers used were primary food rewards rather than the secondary conditioned reinforcers of class credit used in the earlier study.

From Platt's and others' initial concept, social trap research has spread to laboratories all over the world and has expanded into the fields of sociology, economics, institutional design, and the [[nuclear arms race]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Costanza |first=R. |year=1984 |title=Review Essay: The nuclear arms race and the theory of social traps |journal=Journal of Peace Research |volume=21 |issue=1 |pages=79–86 |doi=10.1177/002234338402100106 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Summaries of the many other diverse studies of social traps can be found in Messick and McClelland (1983), Costanza (1984), Komorita and Parks (1996), and Rothstein (2005).

Social trap research continues to be an active area.  Urlacher (2008) devised an iterated version of the [[prisoner's dilemma]] game using groups of people, or "agents", pitted against other groups of agents, in a variation he termed a "two-level social trap".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Urlacher |first=B. L. |year=2008 |title=Walking out of two-level social traps (with a little help from my friends) |journal=Simulation &amp; Gaming |volume=39 |issue=4 |pages=453–464 |doi=10.1177/1046878107311379 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He reported that when using a democratic decision rule, larger groups behaved more cooperatively than smaller groups.  Chuang, Rivoire, and Liebler (2009) constructed a non-mammalian commons dilemma using colonies of the [[bacteria]] ''[[Escherichia coli]]'' composed of strains of producer and nonproducer microbes that contribute (or do not contribute) to the common resource in an examination of the statistical concept of [[Simpson's paradox]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Chuang |first=J.

In 2010, Shaimaa Lazem and Denis Gračanin, in the Department of Computer Science at [[Virginia Tech]], took social traps to a new level: Into [[cyberspace]].  They performed a replication of the original social trap experiment, but created the social trap in the internet virtual world known as [[Second Life]] (Lazem and Gračanin, 2010).  They constructed a virtual experimental laboratory with the subjects responding through [[Avatar (computing)|avatar]]s.  The findings mirrored the original study, by finding that the ability to communicate led to greater replenishment of common resources.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3558">In [[mathematics]], a '''square-integrable function''', also called a '''quadratically integrable function''', is a [[real number|real]]- or [[complex number|complex]]-valued [[measurable function]] for which the [[integral]] of the square of the [[absolute value]] is finite.  Thus, if

: &lt;math&gt; \int_{-\infty}^\infty |f(x)|^2 \, \mathrm dx &lt; \infty,&lt;/math&gt;

then ''ƒ'' is square integrable on the real line &lt;math&gt;(-\infty,+\infty)&lt;/math&gt;. One may also speak of quadratic integrability over bounded intervals such as&amp;nbsp;[0,&amp;nbsp;1].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An equivalent definition is to say that the square of the function itself (rather than of its absolute value) is [[Lebesgue integrable]]. For this to be true, the integrals of the positive and negative portions of the real part must both be finite, as well as those for the imaginary part. The vector space of square integrable functions (with respect to Lebesque measure) form the '''''L&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt; -'''''space with p = 2.

Often the term is used not to refer to a specific function, but to a set of functions that are equal [[almost everywhere]].

== Properties ==
The square integrable functions (in the sense mentioned in which a "function" actually means a set of functions that are equal almost everywhere) form an [[inner product space]] with [[inner product]] given by

: &lt;math&gt; \langle f, g \rangle = \int_A \overline{f(x)}g(x)\, \mathrm dx &lt;/math&gt;

where
* ''f'' and ''g'' are square integrable functions,
* {{overbar|''f''(''x'')}} is the [[complex conjugate]] of ''f'',
* ''A'' is the set over which one integrates&amp;mdash;in the first example (given in the introduction above), ''A'' is  &lt;math&gt;(-\infty,+\infty)&lt;/math&gt;; in the second, ''A'' is&amp;nbsp;[0,&amp;nbsp;1].

Since |''a''|&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''a&amp;nbsp;{{overbar|a}}'', square integrability is the same as saying

: &lt;math&gt; \langle f, f \rangle &lt; \infty. \, &lt;/math&gt;

It can be shown&lt;!-- cite theorem here, with an internal link?--&gt; that square integrable functions form a [[complete metric space]] under the metric induced by the inner product defined above.
A complete metric space is also called a [[Cauchy space]], because sequences in such metric spaces converge if and only if they are [[Cauchy sequence|Cauchy]].
A space which is complete under the metric induced by a norm is a [[Banach space]].
Therefore, the space of square integrable functions is a Banach space, under the metric induced by the norm, which in turn is induced by the inner product.
As we have the additional property of the inner product, this is specifically a [[Hilbert space]], because the space is complete under the metric induced by the inner product.

This inner product space is conventionally denoted by &lt;math&gt;\left(L_2, \langle\cdot, \cdot\rangle_2\right)&lt;/math&gt; and many times abbreviated as &lt;math&gt;L_2&lt;/math&gt;.
Note that &lt;math&gt;L_2&lt;/math&gt; denotes the set of square integrable functions, but no selection of metric, norm or inner product are specified by this notation.
The set, together with the specific inner product &lt;math&gt;\langle\cdot, \cdot\rangle_2&lt;/math&gt; specify the inner product space.

The space of square integrable functions is the [[Lp space|''L''&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt; space]] in which&amp;nbsp;''p''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2.

'''Sun-Ni's Law''' (or Sun and Ni's Law, also known as memory-bounded speedup), is a memory-bounded [[speedup]] model which states that as computing power increases the corresponding increase in problem size is constrained by the system’s memory capacity. In general, as a system grows in computational power, the problems run on the system increase in size. Analogous to [[Amdahl's law]], which says that the problem size remains constant as system sizes grow, and [[Gustafson's law]], which proposes that the problem size should scale but be bound by a fixed amount of time, Sun-Ni's Law states the problem size should scale but be bound by the memory capacity of the system. Sun-Ni's Law &lt;ref name="Sun-NiLaw1990"&gt;[http://www.ece.eng.wayne.edu/~sjiang/ECE7610-winter-11/scalability.pdf] Another View on Parallel Speedup, Xian-He Sun and Lionel Ni, Proceedings of [[ACM/IEEE Supercomputing Conference|IEEE Supercomputing Conference '90]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sun-Ni1993"&gt;[http://www.di.unisa.it/~vitsca/SC-2011/DesignPrinciplesMulticoreProcessors/Sun1993.pdf] Scalable Problems and Memory-Bounded Speedup, X.H. Sun, and L. Ni, Journal of Parallel and Distributed Computing, Vol. 19, p.27-37, Sept.1993.&lt;/ref&gt;  was initially proposed by Xian-He Sun and Lionel Ni at the Proceedings of [[ACM/IEEE Supercomputing Conference|IEEE Supercomputing Conference 1990]].

With the increasing disparity between CPU speed and memory data access latency, application execution time often depends on the memory speed of the system.&lt;ref name="Wulf1994"&gt;[http://www.di.unisa.it/~vitsca/SC-2011/DesignPrinciplesMulticoreProcessors/Wulf1995.pdf] Hitting the Memory Wall:Implications of the Obvious, Wm.A. Wulf and Sally A. McKee, ACM SIGARCH Computer Architecture News Vol. 23 p. 20–24 March 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; As predicted by Sun and Ni, data access has become the premier performance bottleneck for high-end computing. From this fact one can see the intuition behind Sun-Ni's Law, as system resources increase, applications are often bottlenecked by memory speed and bandwidth, thus an application can achieve a larger speedup by utilizing all the memory capacity in the system. Sun-Ni's Law can be applied to different layers of a [[memory hierarchy]] system, from [[CPU cache|L1 cache]] to main memory. Through its memory-bounded function,''W=G(M)'', it reveals the trade-off between computing and memory in algorithm and [[Computer architecture|system architecture]] design.

All three speedup models, Sun-Ni, Gustafson, and Amdahl, provide a metric to analyze speedup for [[Parallel computing]]. Amdahl’s law focuses on the time reduction for a given fixed-size problem. Amdahl’s law states that the sequential portion of the problem (algorithm) limits the total speedup that can be achieved as system resources increase. Gustafson’s law suggests that it is beneficial to build a large-scale parallel system as the speedup can grow linearly with the system size if the problem size is scaled up to maintain a fixed execution time.&lt;ref name="Sun2009"&gt;[http://www.cs.iit.edu/~scs/psfiles/Reevaluating%20Amdahl%27s%20Law.pdf] Reevaluating Amdahl's Law in the Multicore Era, Xian-He Sun and Yong Chen, Journal of Parallel and Distributed Computing, Vol. 70 p.183-188, February 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Yet as memory access latency often becomes the dominant factor in an application’s execution time,&lt;ref name="Scaling the Bandwidth Wall"&gt;[http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.158.2815&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf] Scaling the Bandwidth Wall:Challenges in and Avenues for CMP Scaling, Brian M. Rogers, Anil Krishna, Gorden B. Bell, Ken Vu, Xiaowei Jiang, and Yan Solihin, ACM SIGARCH Computer Architecture News, Vol. 37 p.371-382, June 2009&lt;/ref&gt; applications may not scale up to meet the time bound constraint.&lt;ref name="Sun-NiLaw1990" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sun-Ni1993" /&gt; Sun-Ni's Law, instead of constraining the problem size by time, constrains the problem by the memory capacity of the system, or in other words bounds based on memory. Sun-Ni's Law is a generalization of Amdahl's Law and Gustafson's Law. When the memory-bounded function ''G(M)=1'', it resolves to Amdahl's law, when the memory-bounded function ''G(M)=m'',the number of processors, it resolves to Gustafson's Law.

==Derivation of Sun-Ni's Law==

Let &lt;math&gt;\textstyle W^{*}&lt;/math&gt; be the scaled workload under a memory space constraint. The memory bounded speedup can be defined as:
 ''Sequential Time to Solve W&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;/Parallel Time to Solve W&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;''

Suppose &lt;math&gt;\textstyle f&lt;/math&gt; is the portion of the workload that can be parallelized and &lt;math&gt;\textstyle(1-f)&lt;/math&gt; is the sequential portion of the workload.

Let &lt;math&gt;\textstyle y = g(x) &lt;/math&gt; be the function that reflects the parallel workload increase factor as the memory capacity increases m times.

Let: &lt;math&gt;\textstyle W = g(M) &lt;/math&gt; and: &lt;math&gt;\textstyle W^{*} = g(m\cdot M) &lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\textstyle M&lt;/math&gt; is the memory capacity of one node.

Thus, &lt;math&gt; W^{*} = g(m\cdot g^{-1}(W)) &lt;/math&gt;

The memory bounded speedup is then:

&lt;math&gt; \frac{(1-f)W + f\cdot g(m\cdot g^{-1}(W))}{(1-f)W + \frac{f\cdot g(m\cdot g^{-1}(W))}{m}} &lt;/math&gt;

For any power function &lt;math&gt;\textstyle g(x) = ax^{b} &lt;/math&gt; and for any rational numbers ''a'' and ''b'', we have:

&lt;math&gt; g(mx) = a(mx)^{b} = m^{b}\cdot ax^{b} = m^{b}g(x) = \bar{g}(m)g(x) &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \bar{g}(m)&lt;/math&gt; is the power function with the coefficient as 1.

Thus by taking the highest degree term to determine the complexity of the algorithm, we can rewrite memory bounded speedup as:

&lt;math&gt; \frac{(1-f)W + f\cdot \bar{g}(m)W}{(1-f)W + \frac{f\cdot \bar{g}(m)W}{m}} =  \frac{(1-f) + f\cdot \bar{g}(m)}{(1-f) + \frac{f\cdot \bar{g}(m)}{m}} &lt;/math&gt;

In this equation, &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \bar{g}(m) &lt;/math&gt; represents the influence of memory change on the change in problem size.

Suppose &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \bar{g}(m) =1 &lt;/math&gt;, Then the memory-bounded speedup model reduces to [[Amdahl's law]], since problem size is fixed or independent of resource increase.

Suppose &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \bar{g}(m)=m &lt;/math&gt;, Then the memory-bounded speedup model reduces to [[Gustafson's law]], which means when memory capacity increases ''m'' times and the workload also increases ''m'' times all the data needed is local to every node in the system.

Often, for simplicity and for matching the notation of Amdahl's Law and Gustafson's Law, the letter ''G'' is used to represent the memory bound function &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \bar{g}(m) &lt;/math&gt;, and ''n'' replaces ''m''. Using this notation we get:

&lt;math&gt;Speedup_\text{memory-bounded}  = \frac{(1-f) + f\cdot G(n)}{(1-f) + \frac{f\cdot G(n)}{n}}&lt;/math&gt;

== Examples ==
Suppose one would like to determine the memory-bounded speedup of matrix multiplication. The memory requirement of matrix multiplication is roughly 
&lt;math&gt;\textstyle x = 3N^{2} &lt;/math&gt; where ''N''  is the dimension of the two ''N X N'' source matrices. And the computation requirement is &lt;math&gt; 2N^{3} &lt;/math&gt;

Thus we have:

&lt;math&gt; g(x) = 2(x/3)^{3/2} = \frac{2}{3^{3/2}}x^{3/2} &lt;/math&gt; and    &lt;math&gt;\bar{g}(x) = x^{3/2} &lt;/math&gt;

Thus the memory-bounded speedup is for matrix multiplication is:

&lt;math&gt;\frac{(1-f) + f\cdot \bar{g}(m)}{(1-f) + \frac{f\cdot \bar{g}(m)}{m}} =  \frac{(1-f) + f\cdot m^{3/2}}{(1-f) + f\cdot m^{1/2}} &lt;/math&gt;

The following is another matrix multiplication example which illustrates the rapid increase in parallel execution time.&lt;ref name="Culler book"&gt;{{cite book |author1=David Culler |author2=Jaswinder Pal Singh |author3=Anoop Gupta |title= Parallel Computer Architecture a Hardware/Software Approach |pages=206–207}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The execution time of a ''N X N'' matrix for a uniprocessor is:&lt;math&gt;O(n^{3})&lt;/math&gt;. While the memory usage is: &lt;math&gt;O(n^{2})&lt;/math&gt;

Suppose a ''10000''-by-''10000'' matrix takes ''800 MB'' of memory and can be factorized in ''1'' hour on a uniprocessor. Now for the scaled workload suppose is possible to factorize a ''320,000''-by-''320,000'' matrix in ''32'' hours. The time increase is quite large, but the increase in problem size may be more valuable for someones whose premier goal is accuracy. For example, an astrophysicist may be more interested in simulating an [[N-body problem]] with as the number of particles as large as possible.&lt;ref name="Culler book" /&gt; This example shows for computation intensive applications, memory capacity does not need to proportionally scale up with computing power.

== Applications/Effects of Sun-Ni's Law==
The memory-bounded speedup model is the first work to reveal that memory is the performance constraint for high-end computing and presents a quantitative mathematical formulation for the trade-off between memory and computing. It is based on the memory-bounded function,''W=G(n)'', where W is the work and thus also the computation for most applications. ''M'' is the memory requirement in terms of capacity, and ''G'' is the reuse rate. ''W=G(M)'' gives a very simple, but effective, description of the relation between computation and memory requirement. From an architecture viewpoint, the memory-bounded model suggests the size, as well as speed, of the cache(s) should match the CPU performance. Today, modern microprocessors such as the [[Pentium Pro]], [[Alpha 21164]], [[StrongARM|Strong Arm SA110]], and Longson-3A use 80% or more of their transistors for the on-chip cache rather than computing components. From an algorithm design viewpoint, we should reduce the number of memory accesses. That is, reuse the data when it is possible. The function ''G()'' gives the reuse rate. Today, the term [[memory bound function]]s has become a general term which refers to functions which involve extensive memory access.&lt;ref name=AlgorithmMemHierarchy&gt;U.Meyer, P.Sanders, and J.F. Sibeyn (Eds.), Algorithms for Memory Hierarchies, Vol. 2625 of LNCS Springer, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; Memory complexity analysis has become a discipline of computer algorithm analysis.

In the mathematical discipline of [[graph theory]], the '''(''m'',''n'')-tadpole graph''' is a special type of [[graph (graph theory)|graph]] consisting of a [[cycle graph]] on ''m'' (at least&amp;nbsp;3) vertices and a [[path graph]] on ''n'' vertices, connected with a [[bridge (graph theory)|bridge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=DeMaio|first1=Joe|last2=Jacobson|first2=John|title=Fibonacci number of the tadpole graph|journal=Electronic Journal of Graph Theory and Applications|date=2014|volume=2|issue=2|pages=129–138|doi=10.5614/ejgta.2014.2.2.5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[mathematics|mathematical]] field of [[graph theory]], the '''Tutte graph''' is a 3-[[regular graph]] with 46 vertices and 69 edges named after [[W. T. Tutte]].&lt;ref&gt;{{MathWorld|urlname=TuttesGraph|title=Tutte's Graph}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has [[chromatic number]] 3, [[chromatic index]] 3, girth 4 and diameter 8.

The Tutte graph is a [[cubic graph|cubic]] [[polyhedral graph]], but is non-[[hamiltonian graph|hamiltonian]]. Therefore, it is a counterexample to [[Tait's conjecture]] that every 3-regular polyhedron has a Hamiltonian cycle.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=P. G.|last=Tait|authorlink=P. G. Tait|title=Listing's ''Topologie''|journal=[[Philosophical Magazine]] |series=5th Series|volume=17|year=1884|pages=30–46}}. Reprinted in ''Scientific Papers'', Vol. II, pp. 85–98.&lt;/ref&gt;

Published by Tutte in 1946, it is the first counterexample constructed for this conjecture.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|doi=10.1112/jlms/s1-21.2.98|first=W. T.|last=Tutte|authorlink=W. T. Tutte|title=On Hamiltonian circuits|year=1946|url=http://jlms.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/reprint/s1-21/2/98.pdf|journal=Journal of the London Mathematical Society|volume=21|issue=2|pages=98–101}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Other counterexamples were found later, in many cases based on [[Grinberg's theorem]].

==Construction==
[[File:Tutte fragment.svg|thumb|left|130px|The Tutte fragment.]]
From a small planar graph called the Tutte fragment, [[W. T. Tutte]] constructed a non-Hamiltonian polyhedron, by putting together three such fragments. The "compulsory" edges of the fragments, that must be part of any Hamiltonian path through the fragment, are connected at the central vertex; because any cycle can use only two of these three edges, there can be no Hamiltonian cycle.

The resulting graph is [[graph connectivity|3-connected]] and [[planar graph|planar]], so by [[Polyhedral graph|Steinitz' theorem]] it is the graph of a polyhedron. It has 25 faces.

It can be realized geometrically from a tetrahedron (the faces of which correspond to the four large nine-sided faces in the drawing, three of which are between pairs of fragments and the fourth of which forms the exterior) by multiply truncating three of its vertices.

==Algebraic properties==
The automorphism group of the Tutte graph is '''Z'''/3'''Z''', the [[cyclic group]] of order 3.

The [[characteristic polynomial]] of the Tutte graph is :

: &lt;math&gt;(x-3)(x^{15}-22x^{13}+x^{12}+184x^{11}-26x^{10}-731x^9+199x^8+1383x^7-576x^6-1061x^5+561x^4+233x^3-151x^2+4x+4)^2&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;(x^{15}+3x^{14}-16x^{13}-50x^{12}+94x^{11}+310x^{10}-257x^9-893x^8+366x^7+1218x^6-347x^5-717x^4+236x^3+128x^2-56x+4).&lt;/math&gt;

==Related graphs==
Although the Tutte graph is the first 3-regular non-Hamiltonian polyhedral graph to be discovered, it is not the smallest such graph.

In 1965 Lederberg found the Barnette–Bosák–Lederberg graph on 38 vertices.&lt;ref&gt;Lederberg, J. "DENDRAL-64: A System for Computer Construction, Enumeration and Notation of Organic Molecules as Tree Structures and Cyclic Graphs. Part II. Topology of Cyclic Graphs." Interim Report to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. Grant NsG 81-60. December 15, 1965. [http://profiles.nlm.nih.gov/BB/A/B/I/U/_/bbabiu.pdf].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{MathWorld|urlname= Barnette-Bosak-LederbergGraph|title=Barnette-Bosák-Lederberg Graph}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1968, Grinberg constructed additional small counterexamples to the Tait's conjecture – the Grinberg graphs on 42, 44 and 46 vertices.&lt;ref&gt;Grinberg, E. J. "Plane Homogeneous Graphs of Degree Three without Hamiltonian Circuits." Latvian Math. Yearbook, Izdat. Zinatne, Riga 4, 51–58, 1968.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1974 Faulkner and Younger published two more graphs – the Faulkner–Younger graphs on 42 and 44 vertices.&lt;ref&gt;Faulkner, G. B. and Younger, D. H. "Non-Hamiltonian Cubic Planar Maps." ''[[Discrete Mathematics (journal)|Discrete Math.]]'' 7, 67–74, 1974.&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally Holton and McKay showed there are exactly six 38-vertex non-Hamiltonian polyhedra that have nontrivial three-edge cuts. They are formed by replacing two of the vertices of a [[pentagonal prism]] by the same fragment used in Tutte's example.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first1=D. A.|last1=Holton|first2=B. D.|last2=McKay|author2-link=Brendan McKay|title=The smallest non-Hamiltonian 3-connected cubic planar graphs have 38 vertices|journal=Journal of Combinatorial Theory, Series B|volume=45|issue=3|year=1988|pages=305–319|doi=10.1016/0095-8956(88)90075-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5824">In [[topology]], '''Urysohn's lemma''' is a [[lemma (mathematics)|lemma]] that states that a [[topological space]] is [[normal space|normal]] if and only if any two [[disjoint sets|disjoint]] [[closed set|closed subsets]] can be [[separated by a function|separated]] by a [[continuous function]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Willard|1970}} Section 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

Urysohn's lemma is commonly used to construct continuous functions with various properties on normal spaces. It is widely applicable since all [[metric space]]s and all [[compact space|compact]] [[Hausdorff space]]s are normal. The lemma is generalized by (and usually used in the proof of) the [[Tietze extension theorem]].

The lemma is named after the [[mathematician]] [[Pavel Samuilovich Urysohn]].

==Formal statement==
Two subsets ''A'' and ''B'' of a [[topological space]] ''X'' are said to be [[separated by neighbourhoods]] if there are [[neighbourhood (topology)|neighbourhood]]s ''U'' of ''A'' and ''V'' of ''B'' that are disjoint. In particular ''A'' and ''B'' are necessarily disjoint.

Two plain subsets ''A'' and ''B'' are said to be [[separated by a function]] if there exists a [[continuous function (topology)|continuous function]] ''f'' from ''X'' into the [[unit interval]] [0,1] such that ''f''(''a'')&amp;nbsp;= 0 for all ''a'' in ''A'' and ''f''(''b'')&amp;nbsp;= 1 for all ''b'' in ''B''. Any such function is called a '''Urysohn function''' for ''A'' and ''B''. In particular ''A'' and ''B'' are necessarily disjoint.

It follows that if two subsets ''A'' and ''B'' are [[separated by a function]] then so are their closures.&lt;br&gt;
Also it follows that if two subsets ''A'' and ''B'' are [[separated by a function]] then ''A'' and ''B'' are [[separated by neighbourhoods]].

A [[normal space]] is a topological space in which any two disjoint closed sets can be separated by neighbourhoods. Urysohn's lemma states that a topological space is normal if and only if any two disjoint closed sets can be separated by a continuous function.

The sets ''A'' and ''B'' need not be [[precisely separated by a function|precisely separated by ''f'']], i.e., we do not, and in general cannot, require that ''f''(''x'')&amp;nbsp;≠&amp;nbsp;0 and ≠&amp;nbsp;1 for ''x'' outside of ''A'' and ''B''. The spaces in which this property holds are the [[perfectly normal space]]s.

Urysohn's lemma has led to the formulation of other topological properties such as the 'Tychonoff property' and 'completely Hausdorff spaces'. For example, a corollary of the lemma is that normal [[T1 space|''T''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; spaces]] are [[Tychonoff space|Tychonoff]].

== Sketch of proof ==
[[Image:Urysohn-function01.png|thumb|250px|Illustration of Urysohn's "[[onion]]" function.]]
The procedure is an entirely straightforward application of the definition of normality (once one draws some figures representing the first few steps in the induction described below to see what is going on), beginning with two disjoint closed sets. The ''clever'' part of the proof is the indexing the open sets thus constructed by dyadic fractions.

For every [[dyadic fraction]] ''r'' ∈ (0,1), we are going to construct an [[open set|open subset]] ''U''(''r'') of ''X'' such that:
# ''U''(''r'') contains ''A'' and is disjoint from ''B'' for all ''r''
# for ''r'' &lt; ''s'', the [[closure (topology)|closure]] of ''U''(''r'') is contained in ''U''(''s'').
Once we have these sets, we define ''f''(''x'') = 1 if ''x'' ∉ ''U''(''r'') for any ''r''; otherwise ''f''(''x'') = [[infimum|inf]] { ''r'' : ''x'' ∈ ''U''(''r'') } for every ''x'' ∈ ''X''. Using the fact that the dyadic rationals are [[Dense set|dense]], it is then not too hard to show that ''f'' is continuous and has the property ''f''(''A'') ⊆ {0} and ''f''(''B'') ⊆ {1}.

In order to construct the sets ''U''(''r''), we actually do a little bit more: we construct sets ''U''(''r'') and ''V''(''r'') such that
* ''A'' ⊆ ''U''(''r'') and ''B'' ⊆ ''V(r)'' for all ''r''
* ''U''(''r'') and ''V''(''r'') are open and disjoint for all ''r''
* for ''r'' &lt; ''s'', ''V''(''s'') is contained in the complement of ''U''(''r'') and the complement of ''V''(''r'') is contained in ''U''(''s'').
Since the complement of ''V''(''r'') is closed and contains ''U''(''r''), the latter condition then implies condition (2) from above.

This construction proceeds by [[mathematical induction]]. First define ''U''(1) = ''X'' \ ''B'' and ''V''(0) = ''X'' \ ''A''. Since ''X'' is normal, we can find two disjoint open sets ''U''(1/2) and ''V''(1/2) which contain ''A'' and ''B'', respectively. Now assume that ''n''≥1 and the sets ''U''(''k''/2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;) and ''V''(''k''/2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;) have already been constructed for ''k'' = 1,...,2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;-1. Since ''X'' is normal, for any ''a'' ∈ { 0,1,...,2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;-1 }, we can find two disjoint open sets which contain ''X'' \ ''V''(''a''/2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;) and ''X'' \ ''U''((''a''+1)/2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;), respectively. Call these two open sets ''U''((2''a''+1)/2&lt;sup&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sup&gt;) and ''V''((2''a''+1)/2&lt;sup&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sup&gt;), and verify the above three conditions.

The [[Mizar system|Mizar project]] has completely formalized and automatically checked a proof of Urysohn's lemma in the [http://www.mizar.org/JFM/Vol13/urysohn3.html URYSOHN3 file].
