This article details the security measures taken in response to the [[2006 transatlantic aircraft plot]].

==United Kingdom==
Following the raids, the terror alert level was raised by Britain's [[Joint Terrorist Analysis Centre]] from 'severe' to 'critical', signalling an attack was believed to be imminent.&lt;ref name="MSNBC-plot"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/14278216/ |title=Details emerge on alleged plot to bomb airliners |publisher=[[MSNBC]] |date=10 August 2006 |accessdate=19 February 2009 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5wg3lJqrg?url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/14278216/ |archivedate=22 February 2011 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Security at all British airports was raised to the highest level, with all property having to go into the aircraft's hold, except for essentials such as travel documents and wallets. Passengers travelling with small children were permitted to carry baby food but had to taste it in front of staff.&lt;ref name="BBC-advice"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/4778771.stm |title=At-a-glance: UK airports |publisher=BBC News |date=11 August 2006 |accessdate=19 February 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090205204831/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/4778771.stm| archivedate= 5 February 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 14 August 2006, the threat level was reduced from 'Critical' to 'Severe'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=Threat level lowered to 'Severe' |publisher=[[Home Office]] |date=13 August 2006 |url=http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/about-us/news/threat-severe |accessdate=18 February 2009 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5whHlJAma?url=http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/about-us/news/threat-severe |archivedate=22 February 2011 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; An announcement was made that the hand baggage rules would shortly be relaxed to permit the carrying of one small item of hand baggage, although the ban on all liquids remained.&lt;ref name=dft20060810&gt;{{cite web |date=10 August 2006 |url=http://www.dft.gov.uk/stellent/groups/dft_about/documents/page/dft_about_612280.hcsp |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060812035241/http://www.dft.gov.uk/stellent/groups/dft_about/documents/page/dft_about_612280.hcsp |archivedate=12 August 2006 |publisher=[[Department for Transport]] |title=Airline security |accessdate=20 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hand baggage was reintroduced at some smaller airports on 14 August, but was not permitted at Heathrow and Gatwick Airports until 15 August.

Despite having made it clear in August that the security measures were "here to stay", at the end of September, under pressure from the flight industry and professional musicians, the British government relaxed the size restrictions to the aviation industry standard (56&amp;nbsp;cm × 45&amp;nbsp;cm × 25&amp;nbsp;cm) and allowed musical instruments as hand luggage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Will |last=Woodward |date=14 September 2006 |title=Relaxation of plane hand luggage restrictions delights musicians |url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2006/sep/14/terrorism.theairlineindustry |accessdate=18 February 2009 |work=The Guardian |location=London |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5whHme9FE?url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/2006/sep/14/terrorism.theairlineindustry |archivedate=22 February 2011 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=21 September 2006 |title=Hand luggage rules to be relaxed |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/5367096.stm |accessdate=18 February 2009 |publisher=BBC News |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5whHn9YIX?url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/5367096.stm |archivedate=22 February 2011 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 6 November 2006 the restrictions were relaxed once again to allow limited volumes of liquids in the cabin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4789593.stm |title=Baggage advice for UK passengers |publisher=BBC News |date=14 November 2007 |accessdate=19 February 2009 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5whHlwunZ?url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4789593.stm |archivedate=22 February 2011 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2007, Transport Secretary [[Ruth Kelly]] announced that from 8 January 2008, British airports would be able to allow more than one item of hand luggage on board. This was following criticism in October by the shadow transport secretary [[Theresa Villiers]], who said that because of the restrictive rules, Heathrow was "rapidly becoming a national embarrassment".  Chief executive of [[British Airways]] Willie Walsh was also critical, saying that they are "damaging the UK's reputation around the world from a business perspective".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7093795.stm |title=One-bag air travel rule relaxed |publisher=BBC News |date=14 November 2007 |accessdate=19 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==United States==
Following the operation, the [[United States Department of Homeland Security]] banned all liquids and gels except baby formula and prescription medications in the name of the ticket holder in carry-on luggage on all flights.&lt;ref name=fox20060810&gt;{{cite news |title=Terror Threat: New Security Measures at U.S., UK Airports |publisher=Fox News Channel |date=10 August 2006 |url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,207765,00.html |accessdate=21 February 2009 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5whHoPfLx?url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,207765,00.html |archivedate=22 February 2011 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Homeland Security Advisory System|DHS level]] in the United States was raised to 'severe' (red) for all flights from the UK. The terror level for all other domestic or non-British international flights in the United States was raised to High (orange). According to White House Press Secretary Tony Snow, President Bush was aware of the plot by 6 August and approved raising the alert on 9 August.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=Press Gaggle by Tony Snow  |publisher=[[White House Press Secretary]] |date=10 August 2006 |url=https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2006/08/20060810-2.html |accessdate=19 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other countries==

==Hand luggage restrictions==

===United Kingdom===
Passengers travelling from&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.thinkspain.com/news-spain/11647 |title=Spanish airport security controls bolstered |publisher=ThinkSpain |date=11 August 2006 |accessdate=19 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and through all other UK airports were temporarily only permitted to carry-on those items on a restricted list, and these items had to be carried in [[Transparency (optics)|transparent]] [[plastic bag]]s. No liquids could be carried on board.&lt;ref name=dft20060810/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/europe/08/10/uk.terror.baa/index.html |title=BAA outlines new security measures |publisher=CNN |date=10 August 2006 |accessdate=19 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Liquid medications, such as [[insulin]] for [[diabetic]]s, were banned, "unless verified as authentic." All [[laptop computer|laptops]], mobile phones, digital audio players and other [[Electronics|electronic]] items were also banned.&lt;ref name="DFP"&gt;{{cite news|title=Main suspects in massive plane-bombing plot arrested |work=[[Detroit Free Press]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060820185926/http://www.freep.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F20060810%2FNEWS99%2F60810019 |archivedate=20 August 2006 |accessdate=20 February 2009 |url=http://www.freep.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060810/NEWS99/60810019 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was suggested in ''[[The Times]]'' that the restrictions on hand baggage would be "enforced pending a decision from the [[National Aviation Security Committee]] following which they may be made permanent."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Jenny |last=Booth |author2=Ben Webster, Sam Lister and Angela Jameson |title=Aviation chiefs may make liquids ban permanent |date=11 August 2006 |work=The Times |location=London |accessdate=20 February 2009 |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/us_and_americas/article1084355.ece }}&lt;/ref&gt; This was confirmed by sources close to [[Douglas Alexander]], the Secretary of State for Transport, on BBC News.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4778871.stm |title=Travel chaos grips UK's airports |publisher=BBC News |date=10 August 2006 |accessdate=19 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 14 August 2006, an announcement was made that the restrictions on hand baggage for flights originating in the UK would shortly be liberalised to permit carriage of one small (45&amp;nbsp;cm × 35&amp;nbsp;cm × 16&amp;nbsp;cm) piece of hand baggage per person. Whilst electronics, books, and other dry items were again permitted on flights leaving the UK, all liquids above 100ml remained banned in hand luggage.&lt;ref name=dft20060810/&gt;

On 2 November 2014, liquid restriction rules will be eased.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-oxfordshire-16645733 Cobalt Light Systems test technology for liquid explosives]&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
Similar emergency restrictions were placed on airline passengers traveling within and from the United States. Initially, all liquids were forbidden, including beverages, hair gels, toothpaste, lipstick, sunscreen, and hand lotions, due to the suspicion that liquid chemicals were planned to be used in the attacks.&lt;ref name=fox20060810/&gt; Electronic devices (iPods, laptops, etc.) were still allowed for domestic flights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Amber |last=Hunt |title=Electronics permitted onboard for US travel |work=[[Detroit Free Press]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060822012443/http://www.freep.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F20060810%2FNEWS99%2F60810025 |archivedate=22 August 2006 |accessdate=20 February 2009 |date=10 August 2006 |url=http://www.freep.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060810/NEWS99/60810025 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====3-1-1 for carry-ons====
As of 26 September 2006, the [[Transportation Security Administration]] adjusted the ban on liquids, aerosols and gels. Travellers are permitted to carry liquids through security checkpoints in containers of 3.4&amp;nbsp;ounces (100&amp;nbsp;mL) or less that fit comfortably in one quart-size clear plastic zip-top bag. This procedure came to be known as "3-1-1 for carry-ons" (3.4&amp;nbsp;ounce containers in a 1 quart bag, 1 bag per passenger).  Items purchased in the airside zone after clearing security could be brought on board without restriction. Other exemptions to this restriction include medications and breast milk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tsa.gov/travelers/airtravel/prohibited/permitted-prohibited-items.shtm |title=Prohibited Items For Travelers |publisher=[[Transportation Security Administration]] |accessdate=19 February 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090225064012/http://www.tsa.gov/travelers/airtravel/prohibited/permitted-prohibited-items.shtm| archivedate=25 February 2009&lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===European Union===
On 10 October 2006 a [[European Union]] Regulation placed restrictions on carrying liquid materials in hand luggage across the EU.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32006R1546:EN:HTML |title=Commission Regulation (EC) No 1546/2006 of 4 October 2006 amending Regulation (EC) No 622/2003 laying down measures for the implementation of the common basic standards on aviation security Text with EEA relevance |publisher=Eur-lex.europa.eu |accessdate=19 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This restriction was eased on 2 November 2014 with new RapidScan liquid explosive detectors.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-07-18/eu-abandons-plan-to-end-liquids-curbs-in-air-travel-in-2013.html EU abandoned plan to end liquid curbs in air travel in 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Japan===

On 1 March 2007, The Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport also set out new regulations concerning the carriage of liquids in carry-on luggage for international flights.  Passengers travelling abroad from Japan are required to place liquids less than 100ml into a transparent resealable bag not exceeding 20&amp;nbsp;cm × 20&amp;nbsp;cm.  Any liquids over 100ml are forbidden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.narita-airport.jp/en/whats_new/070209.html |title=Restrictions on liquids as carry-on cabin baggage for international flights departing from Narita |publisher=[[Narita International Airport]] |date=1 March 2007 |accessdate=19 February 2009|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090225181220/http://www.narita-airport.jp/en/whats_new/070209.html |archivedate = 25 February 2009|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Singapore===
On 8 May 2007, Singapore introduced new liquid restrictions, which is limited to 100ml for all flights (excluding Seletar Airport), where [[Changi Airport]] is the biggest airport with more frequent visitors and direct services. Liquids less than 100ml must be sealed into transparent resealable bag not exceeding 20&amp;nbsp;cm x 20&amp;nbsp;cm.

This restriction was eased on 2 November 2014.

===Other Countries===
Subsequently, similar restrictions for liquids in carry on luggage were set out in many other countries worldwide including Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Vietnam, China and Singapore who all set out liquid restrictions on international flights.

==Impact==
Overall, an estimated 400,000 passengers were affected because of the alerts. It has been estimated that the first day of delays cost the airlines over £175 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Allen |first=Nick |title=Prosecutors pursued retrial to justify liquids ban |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |date=7 September 2009 |accessdate=8 September 2009 |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/terrorism-in-the-uk/6152046/WITH-LEGAL-Prosecutors-pursued-retrial-to-justify-liquids-ban.html |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5whHpQQEj?url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/terrorism-in-the-uk/6152046/WITH-LEGAL-Prosecutors-pursued-retrial-to-justify-liquids-ban.html |archivedate=22 February 2011 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; As many as 20,000 bags are believed to have been misplaced at Heathrow in the days following the flight cancellations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4797569.stm |title=BA back to normal 'in 48 hours' |publisher=BBC News |date=16 August 2006 |accessdate=19 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Flight cancellations ===
Some inbound flights to [[London Heathrow Airport]] were cancelled on the day of the arrests, most notably the Thursday short-haul flights of British Airways. Some flights to and from [[London Gatwick Airport]] were also suspended,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/4778871.stm |title=Travel chaos grips UK's airports |publisher=BBC News |date=10 August 2006 |accessdate=19 February 2009 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5whHr5bKs?url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/4778871.stm |archivedate=22 February 2011 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On Sunday 13 August 30% of flights out of Heathrow were cancelled to reduce pressure on the screeners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Nick |last=Mathiason |author2=Oliver Morgan and Rob Sharp |url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2006/aug/13/theairlineindustry.terrorism |title=BA criticises Heathrow as travel mayhem grows |work=The Observer |location=London |date=13 August 2006 |accessdate=19 February 2009 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5whHrkaCQ?url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2006/aug/13/theairlineindustry.terrorism |archivedate=22 February 2011 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; By 15 August flight cancellations had fallen to 47 flights at Heathrow, and 8 Ryanair flights from Stansted.  It was anticipated that cancellations would reduce on 16 August, with 90% of flights expected to depart as scheduled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4795821.stm |title=10,000 bags misplaced at airports |publisher=BBC News |date=15 August 2006 |accessdate=19 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Controversy over the alert===
On 12 August a public argument broke out between [[BAA plc|BAA]], the operator of Heathrow and other airports, and [[British Airways]], with [[Willie Walsh (Irish businessman)|Willie Walsh]], BA's Chief Executive, accusing BAA of not being able to cope with the increased security and baggage checks. [[Ryanair]] also called on the British government to employ police and military reservists to speed up the full body searches which were now mandated, with Chief Executive [[Michael O'Leary (Ryanair)|Michael O'Leary]] saying that:

{{quote|Ryanair and other major UK airlines cannot keep cancelling flights and disrupting the travel plans of tens of thousands of British passengers and visitors solely because the BAA cannot cope with the new body search requirements. If the British government is serious about defeating terrorism and/or not allowing the terrorists to disrupt normal everyday British life, then it must provide the additional security staffing, either police or army reserve personnel, immediately to prevent London's main airports from grinding to a halt over the coming days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Airports may 'grind to a halt' |url=http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/news/article-23363468-details/Airports+may+'grind+to+a+halt'/article.do |date=13 August 2006 |accessdate=21 February 2009 |work=[[Evening Standard]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

On 18 August Ryanair's O'Leary delivered an ultimatum to the British government demanding the resumption of normal hand baggage dimensions and hand screening one passenger in four instead of one in two within one week, otherwise Ryanair would sue the Government for compensation under section 93 of the [[Transport Act 2000]]. The government responded that the actions were taken under the Aviation Security Act 1982, and no compensation was payable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/5261908.stm |title=Ryanair issues security ultimatum |publisher=BBC News |date=18 August 2006 |accessdate=19 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several pilots have complained about the "ridiculous" luggage restrictions that was thought up by "utter morons", the [[Sunday Herald]] reported. Carolyn Evans, head of flight safety at the British Airline Pilots Association, said that "the procedures put in place are not sustainable long term, and unless the passengers are treated more reasonably we will not have an industry left".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sundayherald.com/57459 Are we really at risk from snacks on a plane?], [[Sunday Herald]], 20 August 2006  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060831211531/http://www.sundayherald.com/57459 |date=31 August 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Economic effects===
''[[The Times]]'' commented the day after the arrests, that the economic effects were minor and that the [[FTSE 100]] index showed only "mild signs of strain", suggesting that terror was already priced into assets, that the market impact will be contained, and that "what is lost on the swings may be gained on the roundabouts". It observed that the real commercial risk is that "people's behaviour is altered... change may come so subtly and subconsciously that it is hard to see, let alone measure… people may stop travelling for example, not because they are scared of being blown up, but because they are tired of complying with necessary security measures."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Terror may already be priced into values |url=http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/columnists/article606276.ece |date=11 August 2006 |accessdate=19 February 2009 |work=The Times |location=London |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5whHxCEAT?url=http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/columnists/article606276.ece |archivedate=22 February 2011 |deadurl=no |first1=Philippe |last1=Naughton |first2=Adam |last2=Sage |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Estimates have also been made of the cost to airlines of their disrupted business.

'''Adequate Yearly Progress''' ('''AYP''') is a measurement defined by the [[United States]] federal [[No Child Left Behind Act]] that allows the [[U.S. Department of Education]] to determine how every [[public education|public school]] and [[school district]] in the country is performing academically according to results on [[standardized test]]s. As defined by National Council on Measurement in Education (NCME), AYP is "the amount of annual achievement growth to be expected by students in a particular school, district, or state in the U.S. federal accountability system, No Child Left Behind (NCLB)." &lt;ref&gt;National Council on Measurement in Education http://www.ncme.org/ncme/NCME/Resource_Center/Glossary/NCME/Resource_Center/Glossary1.aspx?hkey=4bb87415-44dc-4088-9ed9-e8515326a061#anchorA {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170722194028/http://www.ncme.org/ncme/NCME/Resource_Center/Glossary/NCME/Resource_Center/Glossary1.aspx?hkey=4bb87415-44dc-4088-9ed9-e8515326a061#anchorA |date=2017-07-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
AYP has been identified as one of the sources of controversy surrounding [[George W. Bush administration]]'s [[Elementary and Secondary Education Act]].&lt;ref&gt;New York State Department of Education.

==Description==
The [[No Child Left Behind Act of 2001]], Sec. 1111 (b)(F), requires that "each state shall establish a timeline for adequate yearly progress. The timeline shall ensure that not later than 12 years after the 2001-2002 school year, all students in each group described in subparagraph (C)(v) will meet or exceed the State's standards." These timelines are developed by [[State education agency|state education agencies]] working under guidance from the federal government. The No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB) is the law used as the primary statute governing the federal government's role in education. 

The federal government's role in this area was earlier defined under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA). The ESEA stated that its purpose was to strengthen and improve educational quality and educational opportunities in the nation's elementary and secondary schools. These goals were to be achieved through financial assistance to local educational agencies for the education of children of low-income families or with disabilities.&lt;ref name="ESEA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nysl.nysed.gov/Archimages/91338.PDF |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090514222926/http://nysl.nysed.gov/Archimages/91338.PDF |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2009-05-14 |title=Elementary &amp; Secondary Education Act (ESEA)(P.L. 89-10) }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, ESEA was modified and renamed the No Child Left Behind Act.&lt;ref name="No Child Left Behind Act"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/n/no_child_left_behind_act/index.html |title=No Child Left Behind Act | work=The New York Times | first=Sam |last=Dillon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Strengthening and improving the education of elementary and secondary school students remains the goal of NCLB and the AYP measurement.

According to the Department of Education, AYP is a diagnostic tool that determines how schools need to improve and where financial resources should be allocated. Former [[U.S. Secretary of Education]] [[Rod Paige]] wrote, "The statute gives States and local educational agencies significant flexibility in how they direct resources and tailor interventions to the needs of individual schools identified for improvement... schools are held accountable for the achievement of all students, not just average student performance."&lt;ref&gt;Paige, R. (2002) [http://www.ed.gov/policy/elsec/guid/secletter/020724.html "Key Policy Letters Signed by the Education Secretary or Deputy Secretary,"]  U.S. Department of Education. 7/25/02. Retrieved 6/31/07.&lt;/ref&gt;

The NCLB makes provisions for schools that do not demonstrate adequate yearly progress. Those that do not meet AYP for two years in a row are identified as "schools in need of improvement" and are subject to immediate interventions by the [[State Education Agency]] in their state. First steps include [[technical assistance]] and then, according to the Department of Education, "more serious corrective actions" occur if the school fails to make AYP.&lt;ref&gt;(nd) [ "The Facts About...Making Gains Every Year".] U.S. Department of Education. Retrieved 6/31/07.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purpose==
The purpose of the No Child Left Behind Act is to ensure that all children have a fair, equal, and significant opportunity to obtain a high-quality education and reach. This is ensured through the use of academic assessments, teacher preparation and training, rigorous curriculum and adequate and proper instructional material that will in turn aid in performance on the challenging state academic standards that all students are to meet with proficiency. This process is meant to help meet the educational needs of low-achieving children in the nation's poverty-stricken schools, and have every school performing at a national standard level. If this is achieved, then NCLB is said to have "closed the gap". This means that the achievement gap between high- and low-performing schools and children will be less prominent and all will be achieving at the same level and standard throughout the nation. Thus, there will be no child left behind and no schools identified as "schools in need of improvement".&lt;ref name="StatementofPurpose"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2.ed.gov/policy/elsec/leg/esea02/pg1.html#sec1001 |title=Title I. SEC. 1001. Statement of Purpose}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Details==

===Requirements===
All kindergarten through twelfth grade schools are required to demonstrate AYP in the areas of [[Reading (process)|reading]]/[[language arts]], [[mathematics]], [[Graduation#United States|graduation]] rates for high schools and districts, and at least one other academic indicator.&lt;ref&gt;(nd)[http://www2.ed.gov/policy/elsec/leg/esea02/pg2.html#sec1111]. US Department of Education. Retrieved 5/14/2013&lt;/ref&gt; 
States are in charge of developing their own criteria for meeting AYP and must submit them for approval.  Upon receipt, all criteria provided will be [[peer reviewed]] by a panel including representatives, parents, teachers and state and local educational agencies.  After review, the states will receive feedback and recommendations from panelists on how to better align their criteria with the statute of No Child Left Behind.  These requirements include ten specific guidelines:

#  A single statewide accountability system which is applied to all public schools and [[local education agencies]]. 
#   The state accountability system must include all public school students.
#   A state's definition of AYP must be based on expectations for growth in student achievement that includes that all students will be proficient in reading and math by 2013-2014.
#  A state must make annual decisions about the achievement of all public schools and [[local education agencies]].  
#  All public schools and [[local education agencies]] will be held accountable for the achievement of all individual subgroups. 
#  A state's definition of AYP must be based primarily on the state's academic assessments.  
#  A state's definition of AYP must include graduation rates for high schools, as well as an additional indicator for middle and elementary schools, which may be selected by the states (such as attendance rates).
#  AYP must be based on [[Reading (process)|reading]]/[[language arts]] and [[mathematics]] achievement objectives.  
#  A state's accountability system must be statistically valid and reliable. 
#   To make AYP as a school, a state must ensure that it has assessed at least 95% of students in each subgroup (special education, English language learners, low income, race/ethnicity) enrolled.&lt;ref&gt;(nd)Key Policy Letters Signed by the Education Secretary or Deputy Secretary [http://www2.ed.gov/policy/elsec/guid/secletter/020724.html]. US Department of Education. Retrieved 10/29/11.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Currently, schools are allowed to appeal their AYP findings to their State Education Agency and/or the U.S. Department of Education, if applicable. Appeals have been made in account of [[standardized test]] results and data collected by testing companies such as [[Educational Testing Service]].&lt;ref&gt;(2006) [http://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/ay/letter080106.asp 2005-2006 Accountability Progress Reporting.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070703095326/http://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/ay/letter080106.asp |date=July 3, 2007 }} California Department of Education. Retrieved 6/29/07.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Assessment===
The NCLB requires that states use [[standardized test|standardized assessments]] in order to measure AYP. These assessments allow state education agencies to develop target starting goals for AYP. After those are developed, states must increase student achievement in gradual increments in order for 100 percent of the students to become proficient on state assessments by the 2013-14 school year.&lt;ref&gt;(nd) [http://www.michigan.gov/mde/0,1607,7-140-22709_22875---,00.html "Adequate Yearly Progress."]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070627044827/http://www.michigan.gov/mde/0%2C1607%2C7-140-22709_22875---%2C00.html |date=June 27, 2007 }} Michigan Department of Education.

The same process was used to establish starting points for reading and math." Using assessment data from 2002, the U.S. Department of Education determined what specific percentages of students each state is required to make proficient in each subject area. Special considerations were made for students with limited [[English language|English]] proficiency and individuals with disabilities. Once those percentages were determined, each State Department of Education is required to ensure the standards are the same for each public school, district and subgroup of students, irrespective of differences.&lt;ref name="isbe.state.il.us"&gt;(nd) [http://www.isbe.state.il.us/ayp/htmls/faq.htm Frequently asked questions about AYP.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071123172501/http://www.isbe.state.il.us/ayp/htmls/faq.htm |date=2007-11-23 }} Illinois State Board of Education.

===Successful progress===
Adequate Yearly Progress requires that every public school complete three requirements annually. 
Requirements for the percentage of growth is determined on a state-by-state basis.&lt;ref&gt;Popham, W.J. (2004) "Chapter 2: Annual Yearly Progress (AYP): Little letters, big impact," ''America's "Failing" Schools: How Parents and Teachers Can Cope with No Child Left Behind''. Routledge. p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; In Illinois those requirements include: 

# At least 95 percent of all students are tested for reading and mathematics.
# At least 95 percent of all students meet the minimum annual target for meeting or exceeding standards for reading and mathematics.
# At least 95 percent of all students meet the minimum annual target for attendance rate for elementary and middle schools or graduation rate for high schools.&lt;ref name="isbe.state.il.us"/&gt;

Additionally, state education agencies must determine the yearly progress of districts and identify districts in need of improvement.&lt;ref&gt;(2002) "No Child Left Behind: A desktop reference." DIANE Publishing. p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; Some states, including [[Missouri]], have lowered standards in order to assure the success of their schools and districts meeting AYP.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, C. (2004) [http://www.semissourian.com/story/143981.html "State lowers test standard to meet federal guidelines,"] ''Southeast Missourian'' 9/15/04. Retrieved 6/30/07.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Unsuccessful progress===
Every state education agency is required to determine which schools do not meet AYP every year. However, a specific designation by the U.S. Department of Education called "Federal school improvement status" applies only to schools that receive [[Title I]] funds. State education agencies are required to determine what larger goals are required of every school as they fail to perform annually.&lt;ref&gt;Case, A.G. (2004) ''How to Get the Most Reform for Your Reform Money.'' Rowman &amp; Littlefield. p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt;

If [[Elementary and Secondary Education Act|Title I schools]] do not meet AYP for two consecutive years, they are placed in "Choice" School Improvement Status, which means they must develop an improvement plan, provide students the option to transfer to a different school and provide them transportation to get there, and use part of their Title I funds for professional development for their teachers and staff.  If a school does not make AYP for three consecutive years, they will be in "Supplemental Services" School Improvement Status, which means that in addition to all the "Choice" requirements above, they must also use some of their Title I funds to support students by providing tutoring or after-school programs from a state-approved provider.  If a school fails AYP for four years in a row they enter "Corrective Action" Improvement Status, where they must provide both "Choice" and "Supplemental Services", as well as choose one of the following: replace responsible staff, implement a new curriculum, decrease a school's management authority, appoint an external expert to advise the school, or restructure the internal organization of the school.&lt;ref name=Manwaring&gt;Manwaring, Robert.(2010)[http://www.educationsector.org/usr_doc/Restructuring.pdf ''RESTRUCTURING ‘RESTRUCTURING’: Improving Interventions for Low-Performing Schools and Districts.''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402131953/http://www.educationsector.org/usr_doc/Restructuring.pdf |date=April 2, 2015 }} Retrieved 10/29/11.&lt;/ref&gt; Lastly, if a school fails AYP for five years or more, they must implement one of the following: 

* Chartering: closing and reopening as a public [[Charter schools|charter school]]
* Reconstitution: replacing school staff, including the principal, relevant to the failure in the school
* Contracting: contracting with an outside entity to operate the school
* State takeovers: turning the school operations over to the [[state education agency]]
* Any other major governance restructuring: engaging in another form of major restructuring that makes fundamental reforms&lt;ref&gt;CCSRI. (2008) {{cite web|url=http://www.centerforcsri.org/files/RestructuringGuide.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-06-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090115202626/http://www.centerforcsri.org/files/RestructuringGuide.pdf |archivedate=2009-01-15 |df= }} "School Restructuring What Works When? A Guide for Education Leaders." Retrieved 6/24/09.&lt;/ref&gt; 

These "other major governance restructuring" strategies were most popular in restructuring schools in 2007-2008, and allow schools to do a variety of things to improve their schools such as narrow the grade range, re-open as a theme school, close the school, create smaller learning communities, or create their own option that is not provided by the Department of Education. &lt;ref name="Manwaring" /&gt;

The option of extending NCLB-required sanctions to non-Title I schools does exist; however, there is little current research indicating the implementation of this practice.&lt;ref&gt;Education Commission of the States. (2004) [http://www.ecs.org/html/Special/NCLB/ReportToTheNation/docs/Indicator_2.pdf "Indicator 2: Adequate Yearly Progress (AYP)"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070804045220/http://www.ecs.org/html/Special/NCLB/ReportToTheNation/docs/Indicator_2.pdf |date=August 4, 2007 }} ''Report to the Nation''.

==Strategies for improving AYP==
State education agencies across the United States have developed numerous strategies designed to improve AYP. For instance, steps taken by the [[Georgia Department of Education]] include new and more rigorous [[curriculum]], the placement of "[[graduation]] specialists" in each [[high school]] across the state, comprehensive high school redesign focused on rigorous and relevant education, and integrated [[technology]] throughout learning, including the Georgia Virtual School and a free online [[SAT]] prep course.&lt;ref&gt;(2006) [http://public.doe.k12.ga.us/pea_communications.aspx?ViewMode=1&amp;obj=1204 Almost 100 Schools Lose Needs Improvement Label".] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071017170401/http://public.doe.k12.ga.us/pea_communications.aspx?ViewMode=1&amp;obj=1204 |date=October 17, 2007 }} Georgia Department of Education. Retrieved 6/29/07.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, outside critics and analysts continue to make their own suggestions on improvements for Adequate Yearly Progress.  One example of this is Robert Manwaring (a Senior Policy Analyst at Education Sector), who has many suggestions at the federal, state and local levels.  On the federal level, Manwaring believes that No Child Left Behind has been too "hands-off"  and that states have been avoiding hard choices such as replacing people in failing schools. He believes intervention in low-performing districts has been too slow to occur.  He believes the key is for the federal government to insist on heavier oversight from the states and to propose shorter timelines for quicker actions to be taken with consistently failing schools.  He believes the federal government should continue to invest in school improvement, but move from a "formula-driven program" to competitive grants, which will reward schools who make drastic improvement in low-performing schools. He believes that states should be in charge of approving the "other major restructuring plans" (as discussed above) for schools, in order to ensure that they are the right steps to drastically improve student performance.  Lastly, he believes Title I funding "comparability" requirements should be changed to make sure that all Title I schools receive an accurate amount of state and local funding.  

On the state level, Manwaring believes that states are reluctant to intervene in low-performing schools, and that many state departments lack the experience or capacity to facilitate school turnaround anyway.  He suggests that states should identify schools in need of improvement, and require districts to implement an intervention model, during which the state will provide support and monitor progress.  He believes they should take control of charter schools by ensuring effective charter oversight, closing low-performing charter schools and providing a fair amount of funding and facilities to successful charters.  Lastly, he states should monitor school restructuring closely and be prepared to step in when needed.  

On the local level, Manwaring believes that since local school districts are closest to the schools, and have the flexibility necessary to act immediately for students, they should change their policies to ensure that schools have an equal amount of resources, and to reinforce the fact that long-term failure is unacceptable. He suggests that districts push for collective bargaining agreements that allow for improving the staff at low-performing schools, including evaluation systems that allow for the timely removal of poor performing teachers.  He also believes that school leaders must be able to make radical changes quickly in order to turn around low-performing schools, with high teacher investment in such policies.  Lastly, he believes that school districts need to be prepared to establish new schools in order to close the lowest-performing schools over time.&lt;ref name="Manwaring" /&gt;

==Controversy==
Schools across the country have restructured according to standards dictated by the federal government, rather than local needs. A principal of one such school remarked, "Putting all of the neediest special education students in a few schools seems to create insoluble challenges under No Child Left Behind." Those determinations often come down to the performance of small numbers of students that do not reflect the progress of the whole school.&lt;ref&gt;Marshall, T. (2007) [http://www.sptimes.com/2007/06/30/Hernando/Two_views_on_school_g.shtml "Two views on school grades: Federal reports show progress, but state grades slip at several schools based on FCAT."] ''St. Petersburg Times.'' 6/30/07. Retrieved 6/30/07.&lt;/ref&gt;  As of 2006, the Program for International Student Assessment (PISA), which performs math and reading assessments of national education systems, does not include special education students as a significant portion of their assessment population.&lt;ref&gt;[https://dx.doi.org/10.1787/9789264076860-7-en "PISA 2006 and the Participation of Students with Special Educational Needs"]. OECD/Joint Research Centre- European Commission, Students with Disabilities, Learning Difficulties and Disadvantages in the Baltic States, South Eastern Europe and Malta: Educational Policies and Indicators, OECD Publishing. Retrieved 5/9/12.&lt;/ref&gt;

Criticisms are being met with a series of innovations on the state level. In 2007, the top official of the [[Ohio Department of Education]] diagnosed that NCLB "paid no attention to whether students below proficient were making strides, or (those) above proficiency." Ohio is proposing a more subtle "growth model" that would allow schools to better demonstrate progress without jeopardizing past academic accomplishments.&lt;ref&gt;Seeton, M.G. (2007) [http://www.cantonrep.com/index.php?ID=361654&amp;Category=9&amp;subCategoryID=0 "State model may change assessment of student progress"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930013148/http://www.cantonrep.com/index.php?ID=361654&amp;Category=9&amp;subCategoryID=0 |date=September 30, 2007 }}. CantonRep.com. 6/24/07. Retrieved 6/29/07.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another controversial concern of NCLB is that it produces unintended consequences on other school subjects. Since AYP is based mostly on standardized state testing on the subjects of math and reading, it is believed that this may cause schools to neglect other subjects. Also, NCLB is thought to provide teachers with the motive to focus energy in the classroom towards the types of questions that students will face on proficiency-based tests as opposed to other questions and topics that should be addressed equally.&lt;ref name="Evaluating NCLB"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://0-web.ebscohost.com.helin.uri.edu/ehost/detail?vid=4&amp;hid=9&amp;sid=6274955d-fa2a-48e4-aa86-2f06920dbaee%40sessionmgr4&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#db=eft&amp;AN=508175616 |title=Evaluating NCLB }}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[New York State Department of Education]] is among a group of [[state education agency|state education agencies]] that have voiced support for AYP.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oms.nysed.gov/legcoord/fedleg05/body.html#no%20child No Child Left Behind] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070509143713/http://www.oms.nysed.gov/legcoord/fedleg05/body.html |date=2007-05-09 }}.

==NCLB effect on teacher quality==
NCLB was not set in place just to make sure students meet proficiency, but also to encourage teachers to become more qualified and agree to working in different environments depending on need. States have developed a variety of incentives to encourage this. These include tuition benefits, loan forgiveness programs, and housing assistance, to encourage people to enter the profession in general, to better their qualifications, or to work in particular school settings. NCLB required that Illinois stop the use of unqualified teachers and in place offered more training so that teachers could come back under NCLB guidelines. After this, employment of not-fully certified teachers was much less prevalent even in the schools with highest poverty and numbers of minorities, where not-fully certified teachers are most seen.&lt;ref name="Teacher Qualifications"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://0-web.ebscohost.com.helin.uri.edu/ehost/detail?vid=4&amp;hid=9&amp;sid=e6969228-2cf1-416e-a644-9c280dd1623d%40sessionmgr11&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#db=eft&amp;AN=508134443 |title=The Changing Distribution of Teacher Qualifications Across Schools: A Statewide Perspective Post-NCLB. }}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Present state of NCLB==
On January 8, 2002, George W. Bush signed the No Child Left Behind Act. According to Arne Duncan, U.S. Secretary of Education, it has created an artificial goal of proficiency that actually encouraged states to lower their standards to make it easier for students to meet goals and bring the school to meet AYP. Duncan also believes that this kind of system narrows curriculum and mislabels schools as failing, even though they may be demonstrating academic growth in other ways other than state tests. Over the years since NCLB has been in place, 44 states have made strides in raising their standards but are now having to explain why their schools are "failing". To fix this, the secretary of state believes the law needs to be less prescriptive and allow school districts to create their own improvement plans unique to their needs. In 2015, the Obama administration offered states flexibility from NCLB in exchange for their own fair and flexible plans to raise standards. So far, 42 states have shown interest in this system and are currently working with the Department of Education. Congress's efforts to reauthorize NCLB&lt;ref name="After10Years"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ed.gov/blog/2012/01/after-10-years-it’s-time-for-a-new-nclb |title=After 10 years, it's time for a new NCLB |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150909071311/http://www.ed.gov/blog/2012/01/after-10-years-it%E2%80%99s-time-for-a-new-nclb/ |archivedate=2015-09-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; ultimately led in 2015 to the [[Every Student Succeeds Act]], which replaced it, modifying but not replacing provisions related to standardized testing.

'''''Aftermath: The Remnants of War''''' is a 2001 [[Canada|Canadian]] [[documentary film]] directed by [[Daniel Sekulich]] about the painful legacy of war, based on the [[Lionel Gelber Prize]] winning book of the same name by [[Donovan Webster]]. The film is co-written by [[Daniel Sekulich|Sekulich]] and [[Allen Abel]], and co-produced by the [[National Film Board of Canada]] and Aftermath Pictures.

Based on the award-winning book by [[Donovan Webster]], this film exposes the human remains, [[environmental damage]], and [[psychological]] [[psychological trauma|trauma]] of military conflict which remain after the fighting stops and the troops go home. The program features interviews with individuals involved with the reparation of the residual devastation - people who destroy unexploded munitions at [[Verdun]] and in [[Sarajevo]], recover and identify skeletons of battlefield casualties at [[Stalingrad]], and help victims of Agent Orange in the [[Aluoi Valley]], Vietnam. Archival footage sets each segment in its historical context.

Filmed on location in [[Russia]], [[France]], [[Bosnia]] and [[Vietnam]], the documentary features personal accounts of individuals involved in the cleanup of war: from [[De-mining|de-miners]], [[psychologists]] working with distraught soldiers, a treasure hunter turned archeologist in [[Stalingrad]], and scientists and doctors struggling with the contamination of [[2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzodioxin|dioxin]] used in the [[Vietnam War]].&lt;ref name="NFB"/&gt;

==Reception==
''Aftermath: The Remnants of War'' garnered multiple awards at film festivals around the world, including a Gold Medal for Best International Affairs Documentary at the New York Festivals Television Competition and a Gold Special Jury Award at the [[WorldFest-Houston International Film Festival]].&lt;ref name="NFB"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.onf-nfb.gc.ca/eng/collection/film/?id=50746|title=Aftermath: The Remnants of War|work=Film Collection|publisher=National Film Board of Canada Web site|accessdate=2009-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Graber associated Occupy with anarchism ideology because of Occupy’s refusal to make demands on the existing state.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bates|first=David|last2=Ogilvie|first2=Matthew|last3=Pole|first3=Emma|year=2015|title=Occupy: In Theory and Practice|url=|journal=Critical Discourse Studies|volume=13|pages=341–355|via=EBSCOHost}}&lt;/ref&gt; If Occupy had made demands, it would be reiterating the legitimacy of the people who made the demands. By refraining from making demands, Occupy is refusing to legitimize the existing political structure of the United States.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Graeber also believes that radical segments of the [[civil rights movement]], the [[anti-nuclear movement]] and the [[global justice movement]] have been based on the same principles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2011/nov/15/occupy-anarchism-gift-democracy | title=Occupy and anarchism's gift of democracy | publisher=[[The Guardian]] | date=2010-11-08 | accessdate=2012-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Media commentary==
Thai Jones, an anarchist writing for the Jewish-American weekly newspaper, ''[[The Forward]]'', asserted that the Occupy movement has demonstrated that the invigorating potential of anarchist political theory can be a feasible model of governance. According to Jones, contemporary anarchists involved in the Occupy Wall Street movement face the same dilemma as their early predecessors&amp;nbsp;— whether to use violence.&lt;ref name="forward"&gt;{{cite web | first = Thai |last=Jone | url=http://www.forward.com/articles/147124/?p=all | title=Occupy Protests Show Radical Potential | publisher=[[The Forward]] |date = December 9, 2011 | accessdate=2012-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Michael Kazin]], writing for ''[[The New Republic]]'', analyzed the composition of the Occupy Wall Street movement. He argued that Occupy members are different from political activists of the late 19th century and early 20th century counterparts, citing contemporary rejection of [[Propaganda of the deed|violent methods]] as the main difference. Kazin described the Occupy Wall Street anarchists as "ultra-[[egalitarian]], radically [[environmentalist]], effortlessly [[multicultural]] and scrupulously [[non-violent]]", describing them as the "cyber-clever progeny of [[Henry David Thoreau]] and [[Emma Goldman]]." [[Social media]] has played a vital role in the Occupy movement and Kazin noted that instead of authoring essays or promoting [[Anarcho-feminism|feminism]] and [[free love]], the Occupy Wall Street anarchists stream videos and arrange [[flash mob]]s.&lt;ref name=tnr/&gt;

== Principles and practices ==

Hammond attributes three core Occupy beliefs and practices – horizontalism, autonomy, and defiance – as also being anarchist values. He also notes that Occupy’s emphasis on the experience of occupation aligns with the principles of libertarian anarchists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pittman|first=John P.|year=2015|title=Red on Black Marxist Encounters with Anarchism|url=|journal=Science &amp; Society|volume=79|issue=2|pages=148–152|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Horizontalism, meaning an equal distribution of power, is demonstrated in the Occupy movement through the creation of a direct democracy that eliminates hierarchy and representative structures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hammond|first=John L.|year=2015|title=The Anarchism of Occupy Wall Street|url=|journal=Science &amp; Society|volume=79|issue=2|pages=288–313|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Occupy operates using mutualism and self-organization as its principles.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The General Assemblies practice direct democracy using consensus to the extent of practicality.

==Portland==
In November 2011, approximately 100 people participated in the "Anarchist General Assembly" and discussed ways to spread anarchist ideas and how to interact with police. The organizers of the assembly published a flier that read, "This is a call to the anarchist and broader anti-authoritarian community to reconvene in assembly and continue to develop ourselves as members of a larger network here in Portland."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.oregonlive.com/portland/index.ssf/2011/11/about_100_people_meet_for_anar.html | title=About 100 people meet for "Anarchist General Assembly" in preparation for Occupy Portland eviction | publisher=[[Oregon Live]] | accessdate=2012-02-26 | author=The Oregonian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Animal Protection Party of Canada'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Best|first1=Stephen|title=Why Animal Protection Party of Canada? Names matter.|url=http://www.animalprotectionparty.ca/animal-protection-party-canada-names-matter/|website=News|publisher=Animal Protection Party Of Canada|accessdate=February 19, 2017|date=November 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a minor registered political party in Canada that focuses on [[animal rights]] and [[environmentalism]]. It was formed in 2005 as the '''Animal Alliance Environment Voters Party of Canada''' by the merger of two organizations, the Animal Alliance of Canada and Environment Voters. Both parent organizations have been vocal in opposition to the [[seal hunt]] in [[Newfoundland and Labrador]], [[fur farming]], [[Trapping (Animal)|trapping]], and [[bear hunting]]. The party is led by [[Liz White (animal rights)|Liz White]], a [[Toronto]]-based animal rights advocate.

==Influence of electoral law==
Federal laws restricting political advocacy by "third parties" (i.e., organizations not registered by [[Elections Canada]] as political parties) during election campaigns led to the formation of this party. Following a [[Supreme Court of Canada]] ruling that allowed political parties to be registered by only running a single candidate, animal rights activists formed the party.&lt;ref name="registered"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.environmentvoters.org/home.html |title=About us |publisher=Animal Alliance Environmentalist Voters Party of Canada |accessdate=2008-09-25 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080802173035/http://www.environmentvoters.org/home.html |archivedate=2008-08-02 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The AAEV party provides its members and candidates the opportunity to promote its views during election periods.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.environmentvoters.org/About_us.html AAEV: About Us]&lt;/ref&gt;

The party's role in most ridings is to endorse a major-party candidate who promotes positions favourable to its own. In the 2006 general election, AAEV's free-time political ads endorsed the [[New Democratic Party]], counterbalanced by the statement that voters could also vote for AAEV party leader Liz White in [[Toronto Centre]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.environmentvoters.org/AAEV-2006-2min.wmv Political announcement (Windows Media Video)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Canadian electoral laws hinder misuse of this loophole by setting campaign spending limits for parties, proportional to the number of voters in the electoral districts where the party is running candidates. Because the AAEV was running only one candidate, it was permitted to spend $66,715.37, compared to the $18,225,260.74 limits granted to the major national parties.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elections.ca/content.asp?section=med&amp;document=jan0606b&amp;dir=pre&amp;lang=e&amp;textonly=false Chief Electoral Officer of Canada Announces Election Expenses Limits for Registered Political Parties]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, the party ran four candidates. In 2011, it ran 7 candidates with one candidate in the Western Arctic riding. In 2015, the party ran 8 candidates, with one in Victoria, British Columbia.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9745">'''Catholic Action''' was the name of many groups of [[laity|lay]] [[Catholics]] who were attempting to encourage a Catholic influence on society.

They were especially active in the nineteenth century in historically Catholic countries that fell under [[anti-clerical]] regimes such as Spain, Italy, Bavaria, France, and Belgium. [[Adolf Hitler]] ordered the murder of [[Erich Klausener]], head of a Catholic Action group in [[Nazi Germany]], during the [[Night of the Long Knives]].
Catholic Action is not a political party, although in many times and places this distinction became blurred. Since [[World War II]] the concept has often been eclipsed by [[Christian Democrat]] parties that were organised to combat [[Communist]] parties and promote Catholic social justice principles in places such as Italy and [[West Germany]].&lt;ref&gt;Tom Truman, ''Catholic Action and Politics'' (London: The Merlin Press, 1960).&lt;/ref&gt;

Catholic Action generally included various subgroups for youth, women, workers, etc.  In the postwar period, the various national Catholic Action organizations for workers formed the World Movement of Christian Workers which remains highly active today as a voice within the Church and in society for working class Catholics.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ewtn.com/library/CHISTORY/zworldmove.htm "World Movement of Christian Workers", ''Zenit'', September 10, 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Catholic Action movement had its beginnings in the latter part of the 19th century as efforts to counteract a rise in anti-clerical sentiment, especially in Europe.&lt;ref name=Nieli&gt;[http://www.uscatholic.org/articles/201506/return-catholic-action-30210 Nieli, Bruce. "A return to Catholic Action", ''US Catholic'', June 30, 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;

A variety of diverse groups formed under the concept of Catholic Action. These would include: the [[Young Christian Workers]], the [[Jeunesse Étudiante Chrétienne|Young Christian Students]]; the [[Cursillo]] movement, RENEW International; the [[Legion of Mary]]; Sodalities; the [[Christian Family Movement]]; various community organizing groups like COPS (Communities Organized for Public Service) in San Antonio, and [[Friendship House]] in Harlem, an early influence on [[Thomas Merton]].&lt;ref name=Nieli/&gt;

==Examples==
Around 1912, as a curate in a parish in Laeken, on the outskirts of Brussels, [[Joseph Cardijn]], who dedicated his ministry to aid the working class, founded for the young seamstresses a branch of the Needleworkers' Trade Union.&lt;ref name=cauthors&gt;[http://www.catholicauthors.com/cardijn.html "Canon Joseph Cardijn", Catholic Authors]&lt;/ref&gt;   
In 1919 he started the "Young Trade Unionists". In 1924, the name of the organization was changed to "Jeunesse Ouvrière Chrétienne", the Young Christian Workers.&lt;ref name=cauthors/&gt; JOC grew rapidly throughout the world; its members were often known as "Jocists" (the movement was often called "Jocism"). By 1938, there were 500,000 members throughout Europe;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=iPad iPhone Android TIME TV Populist The Page |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,788809,00.html |title=Time magazine article from 1938 |publisher=Time.com |date=26 September 1938 |accessdate=2 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1967, this had increased to 2,000,000 members in 69 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=iPad iPhone Android TIME TV Populist The Page |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,788809,00.html |title=Obituary in Time magazine, 1967 |publisher=Time.com |date=26 September 1938 |accessdate=2 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A fruit of the contemporary Catholic Action movement, the International Catholic Union of the Press [[UCIP]] was founded in Belgium in 1927. A year later the Organization Catholique Internationale du Cinéma ( [[OCIC]]) came into being in The Netherlands, and the Bureau Catholic International de Radiodiffusion (BCIR), in Germany. It became [[Unda (organization)|Unda]] in 1946.  These professional Catholic lay associations, working in the world of the professional media, wanted to unite their efforts against the [[secularization]] of society. On the one hand, they were aware that the press and the [[new media]] of radio and cinema were contributing to secularization. On the other hand, they also believed that by engaging in the secular [[media (communication)|media]], they could use them as a new means of [[evangelization]]. Efforts had to be made to evangelize the secular mass media, or at least to insert the values of the [[Gospel]] into them. As a result of the merger of the Catholic media organizations OCIC and Unda, a new organisation was founded in 2001 in Rome called [[SIGNIS]].&lt;ref&gt;Peter Malone (ed.), ''The Emergence of SIGNIS'' (Brussels:  2009).&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014 the [[Holy See|Vatican]] suggested that SIGNIS should also integrate the members of the former  International Catholic Union of the Press (UCIP), which a few years earlier had lost its recognition by the [[Holy See]] as an official  Catholic organization.

==Australia==
{{main|Democratic Labor Party (historical)}}

The [[National Civic Council]] is an Australian Catholic Action group formed in 1957 out of the Australian Catholic social studies movement under the leadership of [[B.A. Santamaria]]. Precursors to the NCC were active in the [[Australian Labor Party]], but were expelled from the party by less conservative members during the [[Australian Labor Party split of 1955|1955 Labor Split]]. The expelled members of the party went on to form the [[Australian Labor Party (Anti-Communist)]] and the subsequent [[Democratic Labor Party (historical)|Democratic Labor Party]].&lt;ref&gt;James Franklin, "Catholic Thought and Catholic Action: Dr Paddy Ryan Msc.," ''Journal of the Australian Catholic Historical Society'' (1996)  17:44-55 [http://web.maths.unsw.edu.au/~jim/ryan.pdf online].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chile==
In Chile, Catholic Action was the name of a nationwide youth movement. Under the aegis of [[Alberto Hurtado|Saint Alberto Hurtado]] it was responsible for the founding of the Chilean Trade Union Association.&lt;ref&gt;Ana Maria Bidegain, "From Catholic Action to Liberation Theology: The Historical Process of the Laity in Latin America in the Twentieth Century" (paper #48 Helen Kellogg Institute for International Studies, 1985)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brian H. Smith, ''The Church and politics in Chile: challenges to modern Catholicism'' (Princeton University Press, 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Italy==
{{main|Azione Cattolica}}

[[Azione Cattolica]] is probably the most active Catholic Action group still around today. Catholic Action was particularly well suited to Italy where Catholic party political action was impractical, firstly under the Anti-Clerical [[Kingdom of Italy (1861–1946)|Savoyard]] regime from 1870 until about 1910&lt;ref name="custodi"&gt;For example in the encyclical [[Custodi di quella fede]] [[Pope Leo XIII]] asked Catholics to become more involved in forms of Catholic Action away from the "Masonic" state: "Masonry has confiscated the inheritance of public charity; fill the void, then, with the treasure of private relief." Para 18, [http://www.ewtn.com/library/ENCYC/L13MS3.HTM Custodi di Quella Fede]&lt;/ref&gt; and later under the [[Fascist]] regime which prohibited independent political parties.

The present association ''Azione Cattolica'' was founded in 1867 by Mario Fani and Giovanni Acquaderni with the name of ''Società della Gioventù Cattolica Italiana'' (Italian Catholic Youth Society), then reformed during the Mussolini regime when the association was structured into 4 sectors and was called Azione Cattolica.&lt;ref&gt;Gianfranco Poggi, ''Catholic Action in Italy'' (Stanford University Press, 1967)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Albert C. O'Brien, "Italian Youth in Conflict: Catholic Action and Fascist Italy, 1929-1931." ''Catholic Historical Review'' (1982): 625-635. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/25021460 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Kertzer|2014|p=55-56, 101-102, 125=126, 158-169}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2290">The '''cultural mulatto''' is a concept introduced by [[Trey Ellis]] in his 1989 essay, ''The New Black Aesthetic''. While the term "[[mulatto]]" typically refers to a person of mixed black and white ancestry, a cultural mulatto is defined by Ellis as a black person who is highly educated and usually a part of the middle or [[Upper middle class|upper-middle class]], and therefore [[Cultural assimilation|assimilates]] easily into traditionally white environments.

Ellis writes, "Just as a genetic mulatto is a black person of mixed parents who can often get along fine with his white grandparents, a cultural mulatto, educated by a multi-racial mix of cultures, can also navigate easily in the white world" (235).&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.huffingtonpost.com/trey-ellis/whos-afraid-of-me_b_981005.html|title = The New Black Aesthetic Revisited|website = The Huffington Post|access-date = 2016-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cultural mulattoes are skillful code-switchers and they may be equally comfortable around blacks as around whites. Members of the New Black Aesthetic are typically cultural mulattoes. Their ability for easy interaction with both blacks and whites is what ultimately allows cultural mulattoes opportunities for class and status [[Social mobility|upward mobility]].

== Examples ==
Examples of cultural mulattoes offered by Ellis include:
* [[Bill Cosby]]'s daughters&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.huffingtonpost.com/trey-ellis/obama-cultural-mulatto_b_41576.html|title = Obama: Cultural Mulatto|website = The Huffington Post|access-date = 2016-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Measles]] is extremely contagious but infection results in lifelong immunity,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/meas.html#epi&lt;/ref&gt; so its continued circulation in a community depends on the generation of susceptible hosts by birth of children. In communities which generate insufficient new hosts the disease will die out. This concept was first recognized by Bartlett in 1957, who referred to the minimum number supporting measles as the [[critical community size]] (CCS).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bartlett|first=M.S.|title=Measles periodicity and community size|journal=J. R. Stat. Soc.|year=1957|series=Ser. A|issue=120|pages=48–70}}&lt;/ref&gt; Analysis of outbreaks in island communities suggested that the CCS for measles is c. 250,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Black FL | title = Measles endemicity in insular populations; critical community size and its evolutionary  implications | journal = Journal of Theoretical Biology | volume = 11 | issue = 2 | pages = 207–11 | year = 1966 | pmid = 5965486 | doi = 10.1016/0022-5193(66)90161-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
  
In 2011, the WHO estimated that there were about 158,000 deaths caused by measles.

Even in countries where vaccination has been introduced, vaccination rates may remain low due to parents choosing not to have their children vaccinated. In [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], vaccination was introduced in 1985. There were 99,903 cases that year. Within two years, the number of cases had fallen to 201, but this fall was not sustained. Measles is a leading cause of vaccine-preventable childhood mortality. Worldwide, the fatality rate has been significantly reduced by a vaccination campaign led by partners in the [[Measles Initiative]]: the [[American Red Cross]], the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the United Nations Foundation, UNICEF and the WHO. Globally, measles fell 60% from an estimated 873,000 deaths in 1999 to 345,000 in 2005.&lt;ref name="UNICEF"&gt;[http://www.unicef.org/media/media_38076.html UNICEF Joint Press Release]&lt;/ref&gt; Estimates for 2008 indicate deaths fell further to 164,000 globally, with 77% of the remaining measles deaths in 2008 occurring within the Southeast Asian region.&lt;ref&gt;WHO Weekly Epidemiology Record, 4th December 2009 [http://www.who.int/wer/2009/wer8449/en/index.html WHO.int]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006–07 there were 12,132 cases in 32 European countries: 85% occurred in five countries: Germany, Italy, Romania, Switzerland and the UK. 80% occurred in children and there were 7 deaths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Eradication Goal for Measles Is Unlikely, Report Says|author=McNeil, G.C.|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/13/health/13glob.html?_r=0|newspaper=New York Times|date=January 12, 2009|accessdate=May 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Five out of six WHO regions have set goals to eliminate measles, and at the 63rd World Health Assembly in May 2010, delegates agreed a global target of a 95% reduction in measles mortality by 2015 from the level seen in 2000, as well as to move towards eventual [[Eradication of infectious diseases|eradication]]. However, no specific global target date for eradication has yet been agreed to as of May 2010.&lt;ref name="WHA63_11_15"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://apps.who.int/gb/ebwha/pdf_files/WHA63/A63_18-en.pdf |title=Sixty-third World Health Assembly Agenda provisional agenda item 11.15 Global eradication of measles |accessdate=2 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WHO63_daily_notes_4"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/events/2010/wha63/journal4/en/index.html |title=Sixty-third World Health Assembly notes from day four| accessdate=2 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 22, 2014, the [[World Health Organization]] and the [[Pan American Health Organization]] declared and certified [[Colombia]] free of the measles while becoming the first [[Latin American]] country to abolish the infection within its borders.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eltiempo.com/vida-de-hoy/salud/colombia-libre-de-sarampion-y-rubeola_13396295-4 Colombia, libre de sarampión y rubéola - Noticias de Salud, Educación, Turismo, Ciencia, Ecología y Vida de hoy - ELTIEMPO.COM&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elespectador.com/noticias/salud/colombia-fue-declarada-libre-de-sarampion-y-rubeola-articulo-470243 Colombia fue declarada libre de sarampión y rubéol | ELESPECTADOR.COM&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Outbreaks==
In 2007, a large outbreak in [[Japan]] caused a number of universities and other institutions to close in an attempt to contain the disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.phac-aspc.gc.ca/tmp-pmv/2007/measjap070601_e.html|title=The Public Health Agency of Canada Travel Advisory |accessdate=2008-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Justin |last=Norrie |title=Japanese measles epidemic brings campuses to standstill |url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/world/japanese-measles-epidemic-brings-campuses-to-standstill/2007/05/27/1180205052602.html |publisher=The Sydney Morning Herald |date=May 27, 2007 |accessdate=2008-07-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in April 2009 there was a large outbreak of measles in Bulgaria, with over 24,000 cases including 24 deaths. From Bulgaria, the strain was carried to Germany, Turkey, Greece, Macedonia, and other European countries.&lt;ref name=EURPROB&gt;{{cite journal | author = Kupferschmidt K | title = Europe's Embarsssing Problem | journal = Science | volume = 336 | issue = 6080 | pages = 406–7 | date = 27 April 2012 | pmid = 22539695 | doi = 10.1126/science.336.6080.406 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in September 2009, [[Johannesburg]], [[South Africa]] reported about 48 cases of measles. Soon after the outbreak, the government ordered all children to be vaccinated. Vaccination programs were then initiated in all schools, and parents of young children were advised to have them vaccinated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.news24.com/Content/SouthAfrica/News/1059/42cd42bfbe5545f8bccdfce63c0db184/29-09-2009-11-01/Measles_outbreak_in_Joburg |title=Measles Outbreak In Joburg}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many people were not willing to have the vaccination done, as it was believed to be unsafe and ineffective. The Health Department assured the public that their program was indeed safe. Speculation arose as to whether or not new needles were being used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theinternationalonline.com/articles/98-childhood-vaccinations-peak-in-2009-but |title=Childhood Vaccinations Peak In 2009, But Uneven Distribution Persists}}&lt;/ref&gt; By mid-October, there were at least 940 recorded cases, and four deaths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news24.com/Content/SouthAfrica/News/1059/54adfc32c0904c0ba92f92b021d68b3a/21-10-2009-11-27/Measles_vaccinations_safe |title=Measles Vaccination 'safe'}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 2010, there was a serious outbreak of measles in the Philippines with 742 cases, leaving four unvaccinated children dead in the capital city of [[Manila]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Measles can be serious|author=Chua, P.S.|url=http://globalnation.inquirer.net/cebudailynews/opinion/view/20100329-261437/Measles-can-be-serious|newspaper=Inquirer Global Nation|date=March 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of May 2011, over 17,000 cases of measles have so far been reported from France between January 2008 and April 2011, including 2 deaths in 2010 and 6 deaths in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Département des maladies infectieuses

Some experts stated that the persistence of the disease in Europe could be a stumbling block to global eradication.  It has proven difficult to vaccinate a sufficient number of children in Europe to eradicate the disease, because of opposition on philosophical or religious grounds, or fears of side-effects, or because some minority groups are hard to reach, or simply because parents forget to have their children vaccinated.  Vaccination is not mandatory in some countries in Europe, in contrast to the United States and many Latin American countries, where children must be vaccinated before they enter school.&lt;ref name=EURPROB/&gt;

In March 2013, an epidemic was declared in [[Swansea]], Wales, UK with 1,219 cases and 88 hospitalizations to date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Measles outbreak: number of cases passes 1,000 in Swansea area|author=Press Association|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2013/apr/30/measles-outbreak-number-cases-swansea|newspaper=The Guardian|date=April 30, 2013|accessdate= May 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 25-year-old male had measles at the time of death and died from giant cell pneumonia caused by the disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Measles sufferer Gareth Colfer-Williams died from pneumonia|author=BBC News|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-23135464|work=BBC News|date=July 1, 2013|accessdate=July 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; There have been growing concerns that the epidemic could spread to London and infect many more people due to poor MMR uptake,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='Very large outbreak' of measles could hit London|author=Legge, J.|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/very-large-outbreak-of-measles-could-hit-london-8591561.html|work=The Independent|date=April 28, 2013|accessdate=April 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; prompting the [[Department of Health (United Kingdom)|Department of Health]] to set up a mass vaccination campaign targeted at one million school children throughout [[England]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Measles vaccination plan in England targets 1m children|author=Gallagher, J.|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-22276975|work=BBC News|date=April 25, 2013|accessdate=April 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1991 in the Philadelphia region, thousands of children were sick with measles. The epicenter of this outbreak was traced to the Faith Tabernacle Congregation, a [[Faith Healing]] church that actively discouraged parishioners from vaccinating their children. A Court Order was obtained to forcibly treat and vaccinate children whose parents would not agree to seeking medical care. Nine children eventually died as a result of this outbreak.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/health/2015/02/19/386040745/why-a-court-once-ordered-kids-vaccinated-against-their-parents-will |title=NPR Why A Court Once Ordered Kids Vaccinated Against Their Parents' Will |accessdate=2015-02-19 |format= |work=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Netherlands===
In September 2008 an outbreak occurred among [[Anthroposophy|anthroposophists']] children in the cities of [[The Hague]] and [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]]. Some 90 infections of unvaccinated children were recorded by the Dutch National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM) by September 29. It was expected the outbreak would spread to the region of the [[Veluwe]], locally known as a [[Bible Belt (Netherlands)|''bijbelgordel'']]  ("Bible Belt") with a large population of unvaccinated children on religious grounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Nederlands Dagblad |date=2008-09-29 |title=Mazelen onder antroposofen zet door (Dutch) |url=http://www.nd.nl/document.aspx?document=nd_artikel&amp;vorigDocument=&amp;id=122193 |format=&amp;nbsp;– &lt;sup&gt;[https://scholar.google.co.uk/scholar?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=intitle%3AMazelen+onder+antroposofen+zet+door+%28Dutch%29&amp;as_publication=Nederlands+Dagblad&amp;as_ylo=&amp;as_yhi=&amp;btnG=Search Scholar search]&lt;/sup&gt; }}{{dead link|date=March 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2013, another outbreak occurred in the Bible Belt in The Netherlands. According to newspaper ''[[Algemeen Dagblad]]'', there were 161 infections, of which 5 infected victims were hospitalized critically ill. 2 of the victims had [[meningitis]], two others had [[pneumonia]] and from one of them, the complications are still unknown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ad.nl/ad/nl/4560/Gezond/article/detail/3467491/2013/06/29/Vijf-kinderen-met-mazelen-in-het-ziekenhuis.dhtml|title=Vijf kinderen met mazelen in het ziekenhuis|work=AD|accessdate=7 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===

After the [[MMR vaccine controversy]] began, the MMR vaccination compliance dropped sharply in the United Kingdom, from 92% in 1996 to 84% in 2002. In some parts of London, it was as low as 61% in 2003, far below the rate needed to avoid an [[epidemic]] of measles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal= Lancet |year=2003 |volume=362 |issue=9394 |pages=1498–9 |title= Separating inflammation from speculation in autism |author= Murch S |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(03)14699-5 |pmid=14602448}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2006 coverage for MMR in the UK at 24 months was 85%, lower than the about 94% coverage for other vaccines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=McIntyre P, Leask J |title= Improving uptake of MMR vaccine |journal=BMJ |volume=336 |issue=7647 |pages=729–30 |year=2008 |pmid=18309963 |pmc= 2287215 |doi=10.1136/bmj.39503.508484.80}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After vaccination rates dropped, the incidence of two of the three diseases increased greatly in the UK. In 1998 there were 56 confirmed cases of measles in the UK; in 2006 there were 449 in the first five months of the year, with the first death since 1992.&lt;ref name="BMJ"&gt;{{cite journal |journal=BMJ |year=2006 |volume=333 |issue=7574 |pages=890–5 |title= Measles in the United Kingdom: can we eradicate it by 2010? |vauthors=Asaria P, MacMahon E |doi=10.1136/bmj.38989.445845.7C |pmid=17068034 |url=http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/333/7574/890 |pmc=1626346}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Cases occurred in inadequately vaccinated children.&lt;ref name="BMJ"/&gt;  The age group affected was too old to have received the routine MMR immunizations around the time the paper by Wakefield ''et al.'' was published, and too young to have contracted the natural disease as a child, and thus to achieve a [[herd immunity]] effect. With the decline in infection that followed the introduction of the MMR vaccine, these individuals had not been exposed to the disease, but still had no immunity, either natural or vaccine induced. Therefore, as immunization rates declined following the controversy and the disease re-emerged, they were susceptible to infection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/index.cfm?c_id=2&amp;ObjectID=10125382 |title=England and Wales in grip of mumps epidemic - 13 May 2005 - NZ Herald: World / International News |format= |work= The New Zealand Herald|accessdate=2008-07-10 |date=13 May 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hpa.org.uk/infections/topics_az/mumps/gen_info.htm |title=HPA&amp;nbsp;— Mumps |work= |accessdate=2008-07-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070502002924/http://www.hpa.org.uk/infections/topics_az/mumps/gen_info.htm |archivedate=2007-05-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Measles cases continued in 2006, at incidence rates 13 times greater than 1998 levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Confirmed cases of measles, mumps &amp; rubella |publisher= Health Protection Agency |date=2007-03-22 |url=http://www.hpa.org.uk/infections/topics_az/measles/data_mmr_confirmed.htm |accessdate=2007-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Two children were severely and permanently injured by measles [[encephalitis]] despite undergoing [[kidney transplantation]] in London.&lt;ref name=Pepys/&gt; Disease outbreaks also caused casualties in nearby countries including Ireland.

In 2008, for the first time in 14 years, measles was declared [[Endemic (epidemiology)|endemic]] in the UK, meaning that the disease was sustained within the population.  This was caused by the preceding decade's low MMR vaccination rates, which created a population of susceptible children who could spread the disease. In May 2008, a British 17-year-old with an underlying [[immunodeficiency]] died of measles.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Rebecca (20 June 2008) [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/2164002/Teenager-dies-of-measles-as-cases-of-disease-rise.html Teenager dies of measles as cases of disease rise] The Telegraph, Retrieved 21 April 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, an '''estate''' comprises the houses, outbuildings, supporting farmland, and woods that surround the gardens and grounds of a very large property, such as a [[country house]] or [[mansion]]. It is the modern term for a [[manor]], but lacks a manor's now-abolished jurisdictional authority. It is an "estate" because the profits from its produce and rents are sufficient to support the household in the house at its center, formerly known as the [[manor house]]. Thus, "the estate" may refer to all other cottages and villages in the same ownership as the mansion itself, covering more than one former manor. Examples of such great estates are [[Woburn Abbey]] in [[Bedfordshire]], [[England]], and [[Blenheim Palace]], in [[Oxfordshire]], England, built to replace the former manor house of Woodstock.

"Estate", with its "[[stately home]]" connotations, has been a natural candidate for inflationary usage during the [[20th century]]. The term ''estate properly'' alludes to estates comprising several farms, and is not well used to describe a single farm.

More generally and usually in modern times, an estate is any large packet of land in single ownership: see

* [[Council estate]]
* [[Housing estate]]
* [[Industrial estate]]

However, by the late 1940s and early 1950s, many had been demolished and [[subdivision (land)|subdivided]], in some cases resulting in [[suburb]]an villages named for the former owners, as in [[Baxter Estates, New York]].

Today large houses on at least several [[acre]]s are often referred to as "estates", in a contemporary updating of the word's usage. In some real estate ventures however, the term's application is stretched, as in [[Jamaica Estates, Queens]] and others.

Traditional American estates include:
*[[Biltmore Estate|Biltmore]], [[Asheville, North Carolina]]; estate of [[George Washington Vanderbilt II]]
*[[Hearst Castle]], [[Central Coast of California]]; estate of [[William Randolph Hearst]]
*[[Castle Hill, Ipswich, Massachusetts|Castle Hill]], [[Ipswich, Massachusetts]]; estate of Richard Teller Crane Jr.
*Meadow Farm, [[East Islip, New York]]; estate of [[H. B. Hollins]] (demolished)
*[[Westbrook, Suffolk County, New York|Westbrook]], [[Great River, New York]]; estate of [[William Bayard Cutting]]
*[[Planting Fields Arboretum State Historic Park|Coe Hall]], [[Oyster Bay (hamlet), New York|Oyster Bay, New York]]; estate of [[William Robertson Coe|William R. Coe]]
*[[Indian Neck Hall]], [[Oakdale, New York]]; estate of [[Frederick Gilbert Bourne]]
*Inisfada, [[Manhasset, New York]]; estate of Nicholas Brady
*Idle Hour, [[Oakdale, New York]]; estate of [[William Kissam Vanderbilt]]
*[[Oheka Castle]], [[Cold Spring Harbor, New York]]; estate of [[Otto Hermann Kahn]]
*[[Harold Lloyd Estate]], 'Greenacres' [[Beverly Hills, California]]; estate of [[Harold Lloyd]]
*[[Filoli]], [[Woodside, California]]; estate of the Bourne Family.
*[[Dumbarton Oaks]], [[Georgetown, Washington, D.C.]]; estate of the Woods—Bliss Family, landscape architecture by [[Beatrix Farrand]]
*Goodnight Estate, [[Stillwater, Oklahoma]], estate of the Emde family
*[[Bernice Pauahi Bishop Estate]], [[Hawaii]]

In [[American English]], the above connotation is the primary meaning of the word "estate" (when it is not prefaced by the word "real").  That is why the [[British English]] terms "trading estates" and "industrial estates" sound like [[oxymoron]]s to Americans, as few wealthy persons would deliberately choose to live next to factories.

'''Fanny Balbuk ''' (1840-1907) was a prominent [[Noongar]] [[Whadjuk]] woman who lived in [[Perth]], [[Western Australia]] during the early years of the [[Swan River Colony]]. Fanny Balbuk (sometimes recorded as 'Yooreel') was born on Matagarup ([[Heirisson Island]]) in the Derbal Yaragan ([[Swan River (Western Australia)|Swan River]])&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nma.gov.au/exhibitions/first_australians/resistance/fanny_balbuk national museum of australia First Australians]&lt;/ref&gt; and her boodja (country) included the swamps and wetland in the area currently occupied by the [[Perth Railway Station]] and [[Perth Cultural Centre]]. She is remembered for her fierce commitment to land rights, and her reactions to the buildings, fences and homes which quickly replaced her boodja (land) as the Swan River Colony expanded at the cost of Noongar peoples' land, language and lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fanny Balbuk Yooreel|url=http://www.nyoongartentembassy.com/fanny-balbuk-yooreel.html|website=Nyoongar Tent Embassy|accessdate=19 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Fanny Balbuk was born to Joojeebal (Doodyep) and Coondenung on [[Heirisson Island|Matagarup]] in 1840. Her father Coondenung was an accomplished hunter and her mother Joojeebal was known for "cheeky" sense of humour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nma.gov.au/exhibitions/first_australians/resistance/fanny_balbuk|website=National Museum of Australia|publisher=National Museum of Australia|accessdate=19 September 2015|title=First Australians: Fanny Balbuk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Fanny Balbuk was born near the [[The Causeway|causeway]] on Noongar [[Whadjuk]] country and would collect [[Cherax quinquecarinatus|Gilgies]] and vegetables from the swampy areas around Perth. She was a descendant of [[Yellagonga]] and her traditional country covers the Perth CBD area. [[File:Noongar regions map.svg|thumb|Map showing Noongar language areas]]Balbuk was well known among the colonists who had grown up around her, Balbuk at a young age had travelled around to places like Northam ,Moore River and Dandaragan and  attended a friendship ceremony where she was given the name Yooreel at Moore river ,she was remembered for her unwavering commitment to maintaining her land rights in the earliest days of the Frontier Wars in Western Australia. Balbuk would walk the track between her birth site and the Railway Station, regardless of any new obstacles, buildings or fences which would spring up in her path as the colony grew. [[Daisy Bates (Australia)|Daisy Bates]] herself wrote ''one of her favourite annoyances was to stand at the gates of Government House, reviling all who dwelt within, in that the stone gates guarded by a sentry enclosed her grandmother's burial ground.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bates|first1=Daisy|title=My natives and I|date=2004|publisher=Hesperian Press|page=65}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Noongar Elder Noel Nannup tells a similar story: ''That was her [[songline]], her [[Dreamtime|dreaming]]. She just kept going and didn’t take any notice of the new city going up. That’s a story of defiance and determination.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fighting for families, Country, rights and recognition|url=http://www.perth.wa.gov.au/sites/default/files/documents/Fighting%20for%20families,%20country,%20rights%20and%20recognition_0.pdf|website=City of Perth|publisher=City of Perth|accessdate=19 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
Fanny Balbuk died in 1907&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bates|first1=Daisy|title=Fanny Balbuk-Yooreel|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article37393844|accessdate=19 September 2015|agency=The Western Mail|date=1 June 1907|page=44}}&lt;/ref&gt; leaving no descendants.

'''Football for Peace''' is a non-governmental organisation (NGO) with its headquarters in London and supported by the [[United Nations Office on Sport for Development and Peace]]. It was co-founded internationally in 2013 by English-born Pakistani footballer [[Kashif Siddiqi]] and Chilean [[FIFA]] legend [[Elías Figueroa|Elias Figueroa]].

== History ==
Originally started by Figueroa in 2006 as a campaign known as Futbol Por la Paz in South America. Siddiqi became the co-founder of Football for Peace Global in 2013 and in the same year, the concept made the transition from "campaign" to implementing NGO status with its international incorporation. The initiative was based on what had been achieved in the Americas, and brought to Europe, Asia, the Middle East, Africa and the Far East.

== Global Football for Peace process ==
In 2015, Football for Peace Global created a peace process&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://footballforpeaceglobal.org/about-us/#approach|title=About Us – Football for Peace – Our History|newspaper=Football for Peace|language=en-US|access-date=6 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is inclusive of peace matches, legacy projects known as "City for Peace" and sports diplomacy toolkits influencing social change. The process was intended to focus on community integration, reducing tensions between different groups and creating dialogue between nations.

=== Peace process lobbying ===
Football for Peace hosted [[Joko Widodo]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.newhamrecorder.co.uk/news/president_of_indonesia_pops_by_for_kickaround_at_newham_school_1_4504798|title=President of Indonesia pops by for kickaround at Newham school|last=Burns|first=Iain|newspaper=Newham Recorder|access-date=6 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 7th president of Indonesia in East London to showcase the peace process on 20 April 2016. He was accompanied by the British government officials where they met 60 youngsters from Newham, London and three Football for Peace ambassadors from Birmingham, who participated in the day-long workshop at Chobham Academy, Newham.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.indonesia-investments.com/news/news-columns/joko-widodo-visits-europe-germany-britain-belgium-and-the-netherlands/item6748|title=Joko Widodo Visits Europe: Germany, Britain, Belgium and the Netherlands {{!}} Indonesia Investments|last=Investments|first=Indonesia|website=www.indonesia-investments.com|access-date=6 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the event, the NGO showcased educational football diplomacy toolkits which included youth leadership programs in bringing together youths from different backgrounds, religions and ethnicities.

In October 2016, co-founder of Football for Peace, Kashif Siddiqi was invited to meet [[Pope Francis]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/londonborn-footballer-kashif-siddiqi-out-to-prove-the-beautiful-game-can-do-good-on-vatican-visit-a3360071.html|title=Kashif Siddiqi out to prove football can do good on Vatican visit|date=3 October 2016|newspaper=London Evening Standard|language=en-GB|access-date=6 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and launch the first "Sport at the service of Humanity" at a press conference,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.romereports.com/2016/10/04/vatican-presents-world-conference-on-sport-and-faith|title=Vatican presents world conference on sport and faith|publisher=romereports.com|access-date=6 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was organised by the [[Pontifical Council for Culture]] under the leadership of Cardinal [[Gianfranco Ravasi]] at the [[Vatican City|Vatican]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://press.vatican.va/content/salastampa/en/bollettino/pubblico/2016/10/04/161004b.html|title=Presentation of the event 'Sport at the Service of Humanity'|website=press.vatican.va|access-date=6 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and welcomed the presence of faith leaders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://uk.news.yahoo.com/peacemaker-kashif-siddiqi-meet-pope-150413530.html|title=Peacemaker Kashif Siddiqi to meet Pope Francis and launch first 'Sport and Humanity' conference at Vatican|access-date=6 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Siddiqi spoke on the Global Peace Process and the role sport has to unite.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ibtimes.sg/kashif-siddiqi-uses-football-analogy-explain-how-he-want-bring-peace-3749|title=Football for Peace at Vatican: Kashif Siddiqi explains how sport can unite people|last=Ullal|first=Naveen|newspaper=International Business Times, Singapore Edition|language=en|access-date=6 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Peace matches and Cities for Peace ==

=== Peace Match 2015 ===
On 8 September 2015, the first international peace match was hosted with the Royal Navy in bringing together Great Britain and Afghanistan. It marked the end of war against the Taliban group in Afghanistan and promoted reconciliation between the nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://afghanistanembassy.org.uk/english/?p=218|title=Afghanistan-England football match could mark end of Taliban war {{!}} Embassy of Afghanistan in London|publisher=afghanistanembassy.org.uk|access-date=6 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was a five aside peace match, which involved members of the Afghanistan national team and Team Great Britain playing together in the same team against a Footballers for Peace side at the old Royal Naval college in London Greenwich.

The unified Afghanistan and Great Britain was led by former [[Premier League]] manager [[Harry Redknapp]], who defeated the Footballers for Peace side in front of a crowd, which included [[Prince Ali bin Hussein|Prince Ali bin al-Hussein]] of Jordan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sitecoreadmin.thepfa.com/news/2015/9/11/football-for-peace-and-her-majestys-royal-navy-peace-match-afghanistan-and-great-britain|title=Football For Peace &amp; Her Majesty's Royal Navy Peace Match – Afghanistan &amp; Great Britain|last=Peace|first=Football for|website=sitecoreadmin.thepfa.com|access-date=6 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Ulysses Grant sidebar}}
'''Grantism''' became a byword by his political opponents and ''[[Lost Cause]]'' supporters, directed at [[President of the United States|President]] [[Ulysses S. Grant]] for political incompetence, corruption and fraud during his administration in the 1870s. The 1869–1877 [[presidency of Ulysses S. Grant]] was marred by many scandals and fraudulent activities associated with persons within his [[Federal government of the United States#Executive branch|administration]], including his [[Cabinet of the United States|cabinet]], that was in continual transition, divided by the forces of political corruption and reform.&lt;ref name=Hinsdale&gt;{{cite book|last=Hinsdale|first=Mary Louise|year=1911 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=C6Re1rvM9nMC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=A+history+of+the+President's+cabinet&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false|title=A History of the President's Cabinet|location=Ann Arbor, MI|publisher=G. Wahr|pages=207, 212–213}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Among them were: [[Black Friday (1869)|Black Friday]], corruption in the [[Department of the Interior]], the [[Sanborn incident]], and the [[Whiskey Ring]]. (The [[Crédit Mobilier of America scandal|Crédit Mobilier scandal]], although exposed  during his tenure, is not considered a Grant scandal.) Some historians defend Grant noting he was the first President to establish the Civil Service Commission, had reformers on his Cabinet, and he ended the corrupt moiety system of privateer tax collectors profiteering by taking a percentage of delinquent taxes. His enemies wanted to undermine the moral integrity of his administration and for his enforcement of [[African American]] civil rights during [[Reconstruction Era|Reconstruction]].

Grant, ever trusting of associates, was himself influenced by both forces. The standards in many of his appointments were low, and charges of corruption were widespread.&lt;ref name=Hinsdale /&gt; Although not directly involved with these scandals, the president's associations with people of questionable character and his reliance on [[cronyism]], [[nepotism]], and [[political patronage]] gave rise to accusations of "Grantism". Historians agree that corruption in the Grant administration was due to Grant's unqualified appointments of close friends and family, and remain perplexed why he protected [[Orville E. Babcock]] his personal secretary.

[[Image:Charles Sumner Brady-Handy.jpg|thumb|260px|U.S. Senator [[Charles Sumner]] (1851-1874) in a photograph by [[Mathew Brady]], 1865]]
The term "Grantism" was originally coined by fellow Republican Senator [[Charles Sumner]] in a speech on May 31, 1872, a Presidential election year. It was used by Sumner to differentiate the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] from Grant. The two men had been political enemies ever since Sumner's refusal to annex [[Dominican Republic|Santo Domingo]] to the United States. Sumner accused Grant of political patronage, nepotism, and being an autocrat like [[Julius Caesar]].

Sumner charged that Grant had hindered [[African American]] [[national sovereignty]] rights in the [[Caribbean]] with the [[Annexation of Santo Domingo|annexation proposal of Santo Domingo]]. Sumner was also angry that Grant used his personal secretary to establish international relations with Santo Domingo, rather than acting through the [[U.S. State Department|State Department]] and [[U.S. Congress|Congress]]. Sumner summed up Grantism as a [[despotic]] government of "one man and his personal will".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Sumner|first=Charles|title=Republicanism vs. Grantism|url=https://archive.org/stream/republicanismvsg00sumn#page/n1/mode/2up|date=May 31, 1872}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lengthy speech was used as the political platform for the [[Liberal Republican Party (United States)|Liberal Republican Party]] and launched the political career of [[Horace Greeley]] as the party's presidential candidate in 1872.

==Grant as reformer==
{{Further|Ulysses S. Grant presidential administration reforms}}
Historian Louis Arthur Coolidge noted that although Grant had critics, including Sumner, concerning presidential patronage, he was the first president to advocate and sign into law [[United States federal civil service|civil service]] reform legislation on March 4, 1871.&lt;ref name="Coolidge pp. 399-400"&gt;Coolidge (1922), ''Ulysses S. Grant'', pp. 399-400&lt;/ref&gt; Grant said that the "elevation and purification of civil service of the government will be hailed with approval by the whole people of the United States".&lt;ref name="Coolidge pp. 399-400"/&gt; The historians H. Wayne Morgan and [[Ari Hoogenboom]] say that Grant's presidential reputation for corruption has been exaggerated.&lt;ref name="McFeely-Woodward pp. 133-134"&gt;McFeely-Woodward (1974), ''Responses of the Presidents to Charges of Misconduct'', pp. 133-134&lt;/ref&gt; Grant placed leading reformer [[George William Curtis]] as head of the civil service commission set up to establish regulations, in order to ensure the best person qualified would hold office.&lt;ref name="Coolidge pp. 399-400"/&gt; In addition to signing the civil service reform, Grant limited and finally abolished the [[wiktionary:moiety|moiety]] system in which private citizens contracted as [[U.S. Treasury|Treasury]] revenue agents and received a percentage of delinquent taxes assessed and collected.&lt;ref name="McFeely-Woodward pp. 133-134"/&gt;

==Modern definitions==
The Liberal Republicans defined "corruption in government" to mean Grantism from 1873-1875.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Reconstruction The Second Civil War|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/reconstruction/states/sf_timeline2.html|date=December 19, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Liberal Republicans ceased to exist after the reforming [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] assumed a majority in the [[U.S. House of Representatives]] from 1875-1881. After assuming control of the House, the Democrats launched a series of corruption investigations into the [[Ulysses S. Grant presidential administration|Grant Administration]] from 1875-1876.  Today, "Grantism" is defined as any political corruption and greed in government. During Grant's presidency, many of his associates took part in [[price skimming]] and [[tax evasion]].  "Grantism" also refers to big business undermining control of local and national government.

'''Zelene beretke''' (English, "'''Green Berets'''") was a paramilitary organization founded in [[Sarajevo]] in early 1992. They were founded by demobilized soldiers and conscripts from the [[Yugoslav National Army]] (JNA) who were mostly ethnic [[Bosniaks]] and supporters of [[Bosnian nationalism]]. They were integrated into a newly founded [[Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] in the second half of 1992. The Green Berets as a gear of choice and name was selected both as a reference to United States Army Special Forces (although no actual relation existed) and as a common colour brand of the predominant ethnic group that composed the unit, namely [[Bosniaks]]. Bosnian Green Berets were mostly active during the war in the early part of 1992 in northern and central Bosnia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N23MpUgJfswC&amp;pg=PA284&amp;dq=Zelene+beretke&amp;client=firefox-a | title=This was not our war: Bosnian women reclaiming the peace | accessdate=March 1, 2011 | author=Swanee Hunt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Grupo Gay da Bahia''' or simply '''GGB''' ({{IPA-pt|ˈɡɾupu ˈɡej da bɐˈiˑ.jɐ|lang}}, ''Gay Group of Bahia'', {{IPA-pt|ʒeʒeˈbe|}}) is the oldest association for the defense of the [[Human rights in Brazil|human rights]] for [[homosexual]]s functioning in [[Brazil]]. Founded in 1980 by [[Luiz Mott]], in the city of [[Salvador, Bahia]], the GGB was registered as a non-profit organization in 1983, and was declared a public service [[organization]] of the city of Salvador in 1987. It is a member of the International Lesbian and Gay Association, it forms part of the staff of the International Lesbian and Gay Human Rights Commission, the National Association of Black and White Men Together, and it is a "twin" of the RFSL of Stockholm.

Since 1989, it has been a member of the [[Ministry of Health (Brazil)|Ministry of Heath's]] National Commission to Control AIDS, and since 1995 it has been one of the coordinators of the Secretariat of Human Rights of the Brazilian Association of [[Gay]]s, [[Lesbian]]s and [[Transvestite]]s. The GGB was directly responsible for the foundation of several groups in defense of the human rights of homosexuals in other states of Brazil, and it provides a meeting space for the Lesbian Group of Bahia, the Association of Transvestites of Salvador, and the Anti-AIDS Center of Bahia, entities which are allied with yet independent from the GGB. In 1985, the GGB promoted the Third Encounter of the Brazilian Homosexual Movement and in 1994, the Sixth Encounter of Brazilian AIDS NGO's. The group publishes the GGB Bulletin two or three times a year, and has produced two dozen pamphlets and booklets about homosexuality and AIDS. Marcelo Cerqueira is the current president of the GGB.

==Objectives==
The GGB has three objectives:
*To defend the [[rights]] to full [[citizenship]] for gays, lesbians, transvestites and transsexuals of [[Bahia]] and Brazil, denouncing and fighting against all manifestations of [[homophobia]] and [[sexual discrimination]];
*To spread accurate information about homosexuality, promoting the establishment of [[sexual education]] courses in all schools, to put an end to ignorance and the conspiracy of silence against the "love that [they] dare not speak its name" through a discourse which is scientifically and politically correct;
*To promote awareness among the greatest possible number of gays, lesbians, transvestites and transsexuals about the urgent need to fight for their full [[civil rights]], as well as to give access to information and support regarding [[safe sex]], [[sexually transmitted disease]]s and [[AIDS]].

==Organization and functioning==
The Gay Group of Bahia is coordinated by six non-salaried Directors, (President, Vice-president, Treasurer, and three Coordinators), elected for three years. Any citizen can become a member of the GGB, independent of sex, [[gender]], [[sexual orientation]], [[gender identity]] or expression, [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]] or [[ethnicity]], [[religion]], or [[List of political ideologies|political ideology]]: the GGB presently has 500 regular members. The GGB has its own center, offered by one of the directors, located at Rua Frei Vicente, 24 – Pelourinho. The space is made up of a three-storey house and holds a small library, an archive and an office with a telephone, fax and computer. It houses the largest archive of [[newspaper]]s, [[magazine]]s, and other printed material on the history of homosexuality and LGBT rights in Latin America. The center is open to the public during business hours.

Since its foundation, the GGB has held two weekly meetings, every Wednesday and Friday, from 8 to 10 p.m. These meetings are coordinated by the group’s Board of Directors and are dedicated to the discussion of topics of interest to the [[gay community]]. Between 100 and 200 people visit the GGB’s center every week, making the number of visitors during the group's 32 years of existence exceed 40,000. The following subgroups form part of the GGB: the Quimbanda-Dudu Group of Black Gays of Bahia; the Gay Stamp Association of Brazil; the Brazilian Association of Parents and Friends of Homosexuals; the Center for Homosexual Studies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ggb.org.br/ggb-ingles.html Grupo Gay da Bahia - English version]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20118">[[File:Versailles Palace.jpg|thumb|right| The [[Palace of Versailles]] where the 1919 discussions concerning Germany took place.]]
The '''Heavenly Twins'''  was the name assigned to two British delegates, the Judge [[John Andrew Hamilton, 1st Viscount Sumner|Lord Sumner]] and the Banker [[Walter Cunliffe, 1st Baron Cunliffe|Lord Cunliffe]], during the 1919 [[Treaty of Versailles]] negotiations who were to set the terms of the peace to be imposed on Germany following the end of [[World War I]]. The two lords, together with the Prime Minister of Australia [[Billy Hughes]], were responsible for presenting the British and [[Dominion|British Dominions']] case concerning the amount of compensatory payments, or [[World War I reparations|war reparations]], that were to be extracted from Germany.&lt;ref name="Guilt"&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt; the phrase was first used by the American diplomat [[Norman Davis (diplomat)|Norman Davis]]. While for historian Antony Lentin,&lt;ref name = "Guilt"/&gt;  the phrase arose among younger members of the British delegation. There were three principal reasons: the  "astronomically"&lt;ref&gt;The classical reference, more obvious in 1919 than today, was to the [[Dioscuri]], twin brothers who are linked with paried stars [[Castor (star)|Castor]] and [[Pollux (star)|Pollux]]  of the [[Gemini (constellation)|constellation Gemini]].&lt;/ref&gt; large sums the Twins thought should be extracted from Germany, the "beatific smile" they would sometimes both adopt after rendering a judgement in situations where they had the upper hand in a debate, and the fact they were generally inseparable at Versailles—both at work and while enjoying the Paris nightlife. Additionally, Britons in 1919 would have been well aware of [[Sarah Grand|Sarah Grand's]] [[New Woman]] novel ''The Heavenly Twins'', a much talked-about bestseller in 1893.&lt;ref name = "Guilt"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Hope"&gt;

==The British position on reparations at Versailles==

===Pre conference dissension: the Heavenly Twins opposing Maynard Keynes===
[[File:1stViscountSumner.jpg|thumb|left|Lord Sumner, one of the Heavenly Twins.]]
In the months leading up to the Versailles Conference, economist  [[John Maynard Keynes]] had been assigned the task of defining the [[HM Treasury|British Treasuries']] position on the [[World War I reparations|amount of reparations]] Germans could be expected to pay. Keynes came up with a figure of £3,000&amp;nbsp;million, saying that in actuality receiving even a total of £2,000&amp;nbsp;million would be satisfactory.&lt;ref name = "SkidelSVol" &gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;   A power bloc composed of businessmen and representatives of the Dominions, supported by conservative politicians, felt this was far too low, but in the autumn of 1918 the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberals]] had the upper hand in the governing coalition, and key ministers generally supported Keynes's view, which he had expected to be able to present at Versailles. The balance of power shifted after the December [[United Kingdom general election, 1918|1918 coupon election]]. While the liberal [[Lloyd George]] was retained as Prime Minister, voter pressure generated by a determined press campaigning had caused him to adopt a hard line attitude towards Germany. Most of the other Liberal [[Member of parliament|MPs]] had lost their seats, including even the party leader [[H. H. Asquith]].

The new government commissioned an alternative committee to re-assess Germany's ability to pay, its members including Lord Cunliffe. The committee estimated that the Germans would be able to pay the full cost of the war at £24,000&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name = "SkidelSVol" /&gt;  While this figure was approximately eight times the annual [[Gross domestic product|GDP]] of Germany before the war, Lord Cunliffe still went on to speculate that he may have underestimated Germany's ability to pay, saying that if someone suggested Germany could pay in the region of £50,000&amp;nbsp;million he "would not disbelieve them".&lt;ref name = "Lords"&gt;

It was decided that the Heavenly Twins would present Great Britain's case at the Versailles conference, with Keynes and the Treasury formerly excluded from high level talks. Keynes still attended Versailles, as the Treasuries' chief representative, with a broad remit to decide financial aspects of the transition to peace—he would still try to influence the reparations settlement by lobbying the decision makers through back channels. Other British attendees would support Keynes' view, including [[Jan Smuts]] the [[Prime Minister of South Africa|prime minister of South Africa]],&lt;ref&gt;Modern scholars have been critical of Smuts as his idealism didn't extend to taking a more than moderately strong  line against [[apartheid]]. However at the time he was the most widely respected member of the British delegation at the council, a man who had a seminal influence on the League of Nations and later United Nations, who [[Einstein]] was later to say was one of only 12 people in the world to fully understand relativity. Smuts had called one of Keynes papers on reparations "masterly" and was a powerful supporter.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Bonar Law]] the [[Chancellor of the Exchequer|Chancellor]], and [[Edwin Samuel Montagu|Edwin Montagu]] the [[Secretary of State for India]].&lt;ref name = "SkidelSVol" /&gt;

===Debate on Reparations at the conference===
[[File:Big four.jpg|thumb|right|  The Council of Four: from left, UK Prime Minister [[David Lloyd George|Lloyd George]], Italian Prime Minister [[Vittorio Emanuele Orlando|Orlando]], French Prime Minister [[Georges Clemenceau|Clemenceau]], and US President [[Woodrow Wilson|Wilson]].]]
Leaders from [[Allies of World War I|32 allied nations]] were present at Versailles,  but major decisions were made almost entirely by the Supreme War Council—briefly the ''Council of Ten'', later condensed to the ''Council of Four''. Referring to the Council of Four, Keynes asserted in his ''[[Economic Consequences of the Peace]]''  that if the world is to understand its destiny it had a great need of light:  {{cquote|… on the complex struggle of human will and purpose, not yet finished, which, concentrated in the persons of four individuals in a manner never paralleled, made them, in the first months of 1919, the microcosm of mankind.}}  
The three principal decision makers were Britain's [[Lloyd George]], France's [[Georges Clemenceau|Clemenceau]] and America's  [[Woodrow Wilson|President Wilson]]—the fourth council member, Italy's Prime Minister [[Vittorio Emanuele Orlando|Orlando]], had little to do with settling the reparations question.&lt;ref name = "origins"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Decisions by the top level council were informed by expert commissions. The Heavenly Twins sat on the commission dedicated to reparations. This commission was itself divided into three sub committees. The first was to assess how much each allied power deserved and in what proportion the moneys would be divided, assuming Germany was unable to pay the full total amount assessed. The second subcommittee was to assess Germany's ability to pay and the third to agree on ways to guarantee payment.

A key issue for the British in the first sub-committee was the American's insistence that compensation should only be awarded for damage to civilians and their property, not for military costs. Taken strictly this would mean by far the lion's share of compensation would go to the French—Britain and her Dominions had suffered huge losses to their armed forces but the fighting had been mainly on continental Europe, with British civilians scarcely hurt at all. Lord Sumner had presented the case that pensions paid to the widows of soldiers should count as civilian costs but the Americans did not agree and so the matter was escalated to the Council of Four, where President Wilson himself was said to reject Lord Sumners argument "almost with contempt".&lt;ref name = "Guilt"/&gt;  Lloyd George then took a hand and, after several days, he was able to convince Smuts&lt;ref&gt;For Lentin one of the great mysteries of the conference,  as Smuts was very much against a harsh settlement. Perhaps he'd been persuaded that including pensions would not raise the total amount paid by Germany, only the share awarded to Britain, although it did not work out that way. In despair at the way the treaty turned out Smuts agreed with Keynes that disaster was looming, and that it was time for Grigua's prayer "The Lord to come Himself and not to send His Son, as this is not a time for children"&lt;/ref&gt; of the merits of Sumners case and got Smuts to re-approach Wilson. The same argument Wilson had roundly rejected from Lord Summer was accepted when put by Smuts who, like the President, was a Christian, a scholar, and an idealist. Other American delegates had tried to persuade Wilson that it was not logical to count pensions as civilian damages but he replied "Logic! Logic! I don't give a damn for logic. I am going to include pensions."&lt;ref name = "Guilt"/&gt; This led to an increase in the share that was to be awarded to Britain, and later would result in the total claim on Germany being increased as well.&lt;ref name = "SkidelSVol" /&gt;

Lord Cunliffe chaired the subcommittee that was to determine Germany's capacity to pay. At first the Twins continued to insist Germany could pay £25bn but the US Treasury representatives [[Thomas W. Lamont]] and [[John Foster Dulles]], supported by [[Norman Davis (diplomat)|Norman Davis]], refused to hear of this and The Twins reduced their recommended figure to £8bn. The leading French representative on the commission, [[Louis Loucheur]], had told Davis off the record that he personally doubted the Germans could afford anywhere near this amount, but that he could not publicly advocate anything less than Lord Cunliff's figure.&lt;ref name = "SkidelSVol" /&gt; The Americans still opposed the revised amount and, after an escalation to the Council of Four, a secret alternative commission was set up consisting of Lamont, Loucheur and Montagu.&lt;ref name = "SkidelSVol" /&gt; This commission recommended the total amount to be extracted to be limited to about £5bn, but Lloyd George would not accept this unless Lord Cunliffe could be persuaded. In [[Robert Skidelsky, Baron Skidelsky|Robert Skidelsky's]] view, Lloyd George was afraid the Heavenly Twins would "crucify" him at Parliament if he agreed to too small a figure—the majority of MPs now being conservative with many also being businessmen. The Heavenly Twins, together with the French delegation and support from Lloyd George, continued to pressure the Americans who progressively gave ground from their initially strong position that only limited reparations should be imposed.
 
Keynes tried to argue against the Heavenly Twins but they rebuffed him, mockingly referring to him as "Herr von K". For most of the conference, Lloyd George himself would only take limited notice of Keynes's plea for moderation. Towards the end however, the prime minister began to show signs that he had moved towards Keynes' view.&lt;ref name = "Lords"/&gt; Keynes came up with a plan that he argued would not only help Germany and other impoverished central European powers, but would also be good for the world economy as a whole. It involved the writing down of war debts which would have the effect of increasing international trade all round. Lloyd George agreed that it might be acceptable to the British electorate. America was against it however, the US then being the largest creditor and also as by this time President Wilson had started to believe in the merits of a harsh peace as a warning to future aggressors.&lt;ref name = "SkidelSVol" /&gt; At the end of the conference a compromise conceived by Dulles was agreed on where Germany accepted a theoretically unlimited "[[Article 231 of the Treaty of Versailles|war guilt]]" obligation, but in practice the amount payable would be limited.&lt;ref name = "Hope"/&gt; Lloyd George worked to insure no firm figure was set by the conference's end, in the opinion of economic history writer [[Liaquat Ahamed]] his plan was to wait until the passions after the war had cooled, and then set about ensuring that a figure well below the Twin's recommendation was agreed on.&lt;ref name = "Lords"/&gt;  By the close of the conference it was left open for the total to be far higher than Keynes's was happy about; the first firm figure recommended by the reparations committee in mid-1920 was set at $33&amp;nbsp;billion.&lt;ref name = "Lords"/&gt; He left before the very end and resigned from the Treasury, writing to Lloyd George: "The battle is lost. I leave the Twins to gloat over the devastation of Europe."&lt;ref name = "Lords"/&gt; Keynes went on to write [[The Economic Consequences of the Peace]], where he warned of the grave consequences of continuing to inflict excessive punishment on the German people. According to Ahamed&lt;ref name = "Lords"/&gt; and historian [[Carroll Quigley]], reparations remained a key global issue for the two decades after the war, consuming statesmen's energies and attention more than any other issue.&lt;ref name ="Hope"/&gt;

==Criticism==
According to civil servant [[James Wycliffe Headlam|James Headlan-Morley]], who was also present at Versailles, the Twins acted as "the two bad men of the conference … always summoned when some particularly nefarious act has to be committed". The Under Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs [[Robert Cecil, 1st Viscount Cecil of Chelwood|Lord Cecil]], referring to Lord Sumner, had said  "Some very able lawyers can be very cruel men".  For the British Prime Minister they were "singularly able men", whose help was crucial in securing an increased share of the reparations,&lt;ref name = "Guilt" /&gt; but Lloyd George was also to record in his memoirs that he had felt trapped by the Twins into pushing for higher reparations than he would have preferred.&lt;ref name = "companion"/&gt;

In the following decades, the French were often primarily blamed for the high payments imposed&lt;ref name = "origins"/&gt; and Britain second though, due to the influence of the Heavenly Twins and the intrigues at Versailles rather than intent by her leaders. An exception was in Germany, where economic writer [[James Orlin Grabbe|James Grabbe]] has stated that the common view in the 1930s was that Britain had desired to economically cripple Germany even as early as 1916, as expressed in this 1934 quote from German historian [[Oswald Spengler]]:&lt;ref name = "IFM"&gt;{{cite book

In 1916 there set in, side by side with the military war, a systematic economic war, to be carried on when the other came inevitably to an end . . . The Treaty of Versailles was not intended to create a state of peace but to organize the relation of forces in such a way that this aim could at any time be secured by fresh demands and measures. Hence the handing over of the colonies and the merchant fleet, the seizure of bank bonds, property, and patents in all countries, the severance of industrial areas like Upper Silesia and the Saar valley, the inauguration of the Republic—by which it was expected (and correctly) that industry would be undermined by the power assumed by trade unions—and finally the reparations, which England, at least, intended not as war indemnification but as a permanent burden on German industry until it should collapse.}}

In 1916 the conservative coalition that acted as the Heavenly Twins power base had yet to form. Modern historians do not endorse Spengler's view, but they have questioned whether the twin's influence at Versailles was really decisive. Were they really formidable enough that the archetypal "man of power" Lloyd George, with his "lightning ingenuity" and uncanny psychological insight,&lt;ref name = "Guilt"/&gt;  would really have been helpless before them? Antony Lentin thinks not, suggesting that Lloyd George had secretly wanted high reparations to be imposed and had set the Twins up as scapegoats. According to Lentin "He was never in thrall to the Twins: they were the obedient agents of his bidding."&lt;ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="42109">'''Housing discrimination''' is [[discrimination]] in which an individual or family is treated unequally when trying to buy, rent, lease, sell or finance a home based on certain characteristics, such as [[Race (classification of humans)|race]], [[Class (social)|class]], sex, [[religion]], [[nationality|national origin]], and familial status.&lt;ref&gt;"Laws Against Housing Discrimination". 2008. Accessed 20 November 2010. &lt;www.peoples-law.org&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; This type of discrimination can lead to [[housing inequality|housing and spatial inequality]] and [[racial segregation]] which, in turn, can exacerbate wealth disparities between certain groups. In the [[United States]], housing discrimination began after the abolition of [[slavery]] as part of a federally sponsored law, but has since been made illegal; however, studies show that housing discrimination still exists.&lt;ref name="Shapiro, Thomas and Jessica Kenty-Drane 2005"&gt;Shapiro, Thomas and Jessica Kenty-Drane. 2005.

==History==
After the end of the Civil War and the abolition of slavery, [[Jim Crow laws]] were introduced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ferris.edu/jimcrow/what.htm|title=Jim Crow Museum: Origins of Jim Crow|publisher=|accessdate=23 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; These laws led to the discrimination of racial and ethnic minorities, especially [[African American]]s. Fifteen state courts obeyed ordinances that enforced the denial of housing to African American and other minority groups in white-zoned areas. These ordinances were then made illegal in the 1917 [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] case, ''[[Buchanan v. Warley]]''. Following this decision, however, nineteen states legally supported "covenants," or agreements, between property owners to not rent or sell any homes to racial or ethnic minorities. Although the covenants, too, were made illegal in 1948, they were still allowed to be present in private deeds.&lt;ref&gt;Silver, Christopher (1997).

===Fair Housing Act===
{{main|Fair Housing Act (United States)}}
The [[Fair Housing Act]] was passed at the urging of [[President of the United States|President]] [[Lyndon B. Johnson]]. [[United States Congress|Congress]] passed the federal Fair Housing Act (codified at [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode42/usc_sup_01_42_10_45_20_I.html 42 U.S.C. 3601-3619], penalties for violation at [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/3631- 42 U.S.C. 3631]), Title VIII of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1968]], only one week after the [[assassination]] of [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]]

The primary purpose of the Fair Housing Law of 1968 is to protect the buyer/renter of a dwelling from seller/landlord discrimination. Its primary prohibition makes it unlawful to refuse to sell, rent to, or negotiate with any person because of that person's inclusion in a [[protected class]].&lt;ref name=legal-dict&gt;[http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Fair+Housing+Act+of+1968 Definition of ''Fair Housing Act of 1968'' ], Legal Dictionary at TheFreeDictionary.com, Farlex Company. Accessed 15 January 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  The goal is a unitary housing market in which a person's background (as opposed to financial resources) does not arbitrarily restrict access. Calls for open housing were issued early in the twentieth century, but it was not until after [[World War II]] that concerted efforts to achieve it were undertaken.

The Fair Housing Act (Title VIII of the Civil Rights Act of 1968) introduced meaningful federal enforcement mechanisms. It outlawed:

* Refusal to sell or rent a dwelling to any person because of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.
* Discrimination based on race, color, religion or national origin in the terms, conditions or privilege of the sale or rental of a dwelling.
*Advertising the sale or rental of a dwelling indicating preference of discrimination based on race, color, religion or national origin.
*Coercing, threatening, intimidating, or interfering with a person's enjoyment or exercise of housing rights based on discriminatory reasons or retaliating against a person or organization that aids or encourages the exercise or enjoyment of fair housing rights.

When the Fair Housing Act was first enacted, it prohibited discrimination only on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, and national origin.&lt;ref name=hud&gt;{{cite web|url=http://portal.hud.gov/hudportal/HUD?src=/program_offices/fair_housing_equal_opp/progdesc/title8|title=Title VIII: Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity - HUD|publisher=|accessdate=23 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1988, disability and familial status (the presence or anticipated presence of children under 18 in a household) were added (further codified in the [[Americans with Disabilities Act]] of 1990).&lt;ref name=hud/&gt; In certain circumstances, the law allows limited exceptions for discrimination based on sex, religion, or familial status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.craigslist.org/about/FHA.html | title = Fair Housing is Everyone's Right! | publisher = Craigslist | accessdate = October 25, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States Department of Housing and Urban Development]] is the [[United States federal executive departments|federal executive department]] with the statutory authority to administer and enforce the Fair Housing Act. The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development has delegated fair housing enforcement and compliance activities to HUD's [[Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity]] (FHEO) and HUD's Office of General Counsel.  FHEO is one of the United States' largest federal civil rights agencies.  It has a staff of more than 600 people located in 54 offices around the United States. As of June 2014, the head of FHEO is Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity Gustavo Velasquez, whose appointment was confirmed on June 19, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=PN1349 — Gustavo Velasquez Aguilar|url=https://www.congress.gov/nomination/113th-congress/1349|website=Congress.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Individuals who believe they have experienced housing discrimination can file a complaint with FHEO at no charge. FHEO funds and has working agreements with many state and local governmental agencies where "substantially equivalent" fair housing laws are in place. Under these agreements, FHEO refers complaints to the state or locality where the alleged incident occurred, and those agencies investigate and process the case instead of FHEO.  This is known as FHEO's [[Fair Housing Assistance Program]] (or "[[FHAP]]").

There is also a network of private, non-profit fair housing advocacy organizations throughout the country.  Some are funded by FHEO's [[Fair Housing Initiatives Program]] (or "[[FHIP]]"), and some operate with private donations or grants from other sources.

Victims of housing discrimination need not go through HUD or any other governmental agency to pursue their rights, however. The Fair Housing Act confers jurisdiction to hear cases on federal district courts.  The [[United States Department of Justice]] also has jurisdiction to file cases on behalf of the United States where there is a pattern and practice of discrimination or where HUD has found discrimination in a case and either party elects to go to federal court instead of continuing in the HUD administrative process.

The Fair Housing Act applies to landlords renting or leasing space in their [[primary residence]] only if the residence contains living quarters occupied or intended to be occupied by three or more other families living independently of each other, such as an owner-occupied rooming house.

====Enforcement====
The Fair Housing Act has been strengthened since its adoption in 1968, but enforcement continues to be a concern among housing advocates. According to a 2010 evaluation of Analysis of Impediments (AI) reports done by the Government Accountability Office, enforcement is particularly inconsistent across local jurisdictions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=US Government Accountability Office|title=Housing and community grants: HUD needs to enhance its requirements and oversight of jurisdictions' fair housing plans|year=2010|url=http://www.gao.gov/products/GAO-10-905}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Subsequent developments===
The federal government has passed other initiatives in addition to the [[Fair Housing Act of 1968]]. The [[Equal Credit Opportunity Act]] of 1974 and [[Community Reinvestment Act]] of 1977 helped with discrimination in mortgage lending and lenders' problems with credit needs.&lt;ref name="Justice"&gt;http://www.justice.gov/crt/about/hce/housing_coverage.php Department of Justice&lt;/ref&gt; The Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988 was passed to give the federal government the power to enforce the original Fair Housing Act to correct past problems with enforcement.&lt;ref name="Yinger, John 2001"&gt;Yinger, John. 2001. [https://books.google.com/books?id=MVP_f-RPLWcC&amp;pg=PA499 “Housing Discrimination and Residential Segregation as Causes of Poverty,”] in Sheldon H. Danzinger and Robert H. Haveman, eds. Understanding Poverty. New York: Russell Sage Foundation, {{ISBN|0-674-00876-6}} pp. 382 ff&lt;/ref&gt; The amendment established a system of administrative law judges to hear cases brought to them by the [[United States Department of Housing and Urban Development]] and to levy fines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://portal.hud.gov/hudportal/HUD?src=/program_offices/fair_housing_equal_opp/FHLaws/yourrights|title=Fair Housing -- It's Your Right - HUD|publisher=|accessdate=23 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the relationship between housing discrimination cases and private agencies, the federal government passed the two initiatives. The Fair Housing Assistance Program of 1984 was passed to assist public agencies with processing complaints, and the Fair Housing Initiatives program of 1986 supported private and public fair housing agencies in their activities, such as auditing.&lt;ref name="Yinger, John 2001"/&gt; Between 1990 and 2001 these two programs have resulted in over one thousand housing discrimination lawsuits and over $155 million in financial recovery.&lt;ref name="Yinger, John 2001"/&gt; However, the lawsuits and financial recoveries generated from fair housing discrimination cases only scratches the surface of all instances of discrimination. Silverman and Patterson concluded that the underfunding and poor implementation of federal, state and local policies designed to address housing discrimination results in less than 1% of all instances of discrimination being addressed.&lt;ref&gt;Silverman, Robert Mark and Patterson, Kelly L. 2012. "The Four Horsemen of the Fair Housing Apocalypse: A Critique of Fair Housing Policy in the USA." Critical Sociology 38(1): 123-140.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, they found that local nonprofits and administrators responsible for enforcing fair housing laws had a tendency to downplay discrimination based on family status and race when designing implementation strategies.&lt;ref&gt;	Patterson, Kelly L. and Robert Mark Silverman. 2011. "How Local Public Administrators, Nonprofit Providers and Elected Officials Perceive Impediments to Fair Housing in the Suburbs: An Analysis of Erie County, New York," Housing Policy Debate 21(1): 165-188.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States Census]] has shown that ethnic and racial minorities living in concentrated, high-poverty areas had actually increased following the passage of the Fair Housing Act from 1970 to 1990.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.census.gov/ U.S. Census&lt;/ref&gt; African-Americans residing in these areas rose from 16 percent to 24 percent, and Hispanics living in these areas have increased from 10 percent to 15 percent.&lt;ref name="Massey, Douglas S 2004"&gt;Massey, Douglas S. 2004. "The New Geography of Inequality in Urban America," in C.Michael Henry, ed. Race, Poverty, and Domestic Policy. New Haven: Yale University Press {{ISBN|0-300-09541-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; While this does not necessarily point to evidence of housing discrimination, it does mirror the phenomenon of white flight—the mass exodus during the 1970s and '80s of European-Americans from cities to the suburbs that left only one-fourth of the Anglo population still living in metropolitan areas. American sociologist [[Douglas Massey]], in his essay, "The New Geography of Inequality in Urban America", argues that this new racial geography in the United States has laid the foundation for housing discrimination to occur in order to keep up the status quo.&lt;ref name="Massey, Douglas S 2004"/&gt;

==Types==
Sociologists Vincent J. Roscigno, Diana L. Karafin, and Griff Tester have determined that the variety of actions that constitute housing discrimination can be classified as either exclusionary or nonexclusionary.&lt;ref name="Roscigno, Vincent 2009"&gt;Roscigno, Vincent J., Diana L. Karafin, and Griff Tester, 2009 [http://www.thecyberhood.net/documents/papers/roscigno09.pdf “The Complexities and Processes of Racial Housing Discrimination,”] Social Problems, Vol. 56, No. 1. University of California Press. pp.49-69.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Exclusionary===
Exclusionary discrimination practices refer to "actions and practices that exclude an individual or family from obtaining the housing of their choosing." These forms of housing discrimination occur at various stages of the rental or sales process.&lt;ref name="Roscigno, Vincent 2009"/&gt; The majority of discriminatory actors in exclusionary discrimination are landlords and landowners, as they have the positional power and direct access to the individual or family and the housing being sought. Other discriminatory actors or institutions responsible for exclusion include real estate, insurance, and banking and lending agents and institutions.&lt;ref name="South, S. J."&gt;South, S. J., &amp; Crowder, K. D. (1998). Housing discrimination and residential mobility: Impacts for blacks and whites. Population Research and Policy Review, 17(4), 369-369-387.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most exclusionary discrimination cases entail forms of outright exclusion, such as a direct refusal to rent to a prospective tenant, direct refusal to sell or discuss the sale of a property, or the false representation of homes or apartments available for sale or rent. Although this outright exclusion is often made up of subtle actions, like lying about standards for rental qualification to disqualify certain individuals, it sometimes also comes with overt verbal abuse and slurs.&lt;ref name="Roscigno, Vincent 2009"/&gt;

Other exclusionary cases entail discriminatory terms and conditions pertaining to the sale or rental of an apartment or home with the purpose of denying access. These forms include unfair financing or loan qualifications or terms, steering or restricting the choices of people seeking homes, differential criteria to qualify to rent a home, and refusing to provide insurance, which would prevent the individual or family from acquiring a home.&lt;ref name="Roscigno, Vincent 2009"/&gt; Consumer advocate groups conducted studies and found that many minority borrowers who were eligible for affordable, traditional loans were often steered toward incredibly high-priced subprime loans that they would never be able to repay.&lt;ref name="Fair Lending and Accountability"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/08/opinion/fair-lending-and-accountability.html?scp=14&amp;sq=housing%20discrimination&amp;st=cse "Fair Lending and Accountability"] New York Times, September 7, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

A study conducted by the [[U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development]] (HUD) found that "the greatest share of discrimination for Hispanic and African American home seekers can still be attributed to being told units are unavailable when they are available to non-Hispanic whites and being shown and told about less units than a comparable non-minority."&lt;ref name="HUD study"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huduser.org/portal/publications/hsgfin/hds.html|title=Discrimination in Metropolitan Housing Markets: National Results from Phase 1, Phase 2, and Phase 3 of the Housing Discrimination Study (HDS) - HUD USER|publisher=|accessdate=23 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nonexclusionary===
Nonexclusionary discrimination practices refer to "actions and practices that occur within an already established housing arrangement, most often entailing racial harassment, differential treatment of tenants, or disparate application of contractual terms and conditions of residency."&lt;ref name="Roscigno, Vincent 2009"/&gt;  Individuals and families already housed experience ongoing intimidation, differential treatment, and harassment, and nonexclusionary discrimination often results in distress for victims since the victim is often legally bound to the home and usually has direct contact with the perpetrator on a regular basis. Landlords and owners are still responsible for the majority of this type of housing discrimination, but neighbors and banking and lending institutions participate more. For instance, even without institutionalized exclusionary power, residential neighbors can harass and intimidate tenants.&lt;ref name="Roscigno, Vincent 2009"/&gt;

Most nonexclusionary discrimination cases involve applying discriminatory terms and conditions within the victim's current residential setting. The majority of these cases involve terms, conditions, and privileges relating to a current rental arrangement. These cases are often seen as unfairly raising the rent of a select group or allowing certain tenants privileges, like using a facility after hours or being lenient on pet policies.&lt;ref name="Roscigno, Vincent 2009"/&gt; Many nonexclusionary discrimination cases involve the failure to provide equal access to services and facilities, such as purposely delaying or completely forgoing fixing a broken pipe. More terms and conditions cases involve discriminatory financing, loans, and appraisals of the individual or family's property, which is when the discriminatory actor takes advantage of the victim financially.&lt;ref name="Roscigno, Vincent 2009"/&gt;

Other forms of nonexclusionary discrimination include the use of harassment, intimidation, and coercion toward victims.&lt;ref name="Roscigno, Vincent 2009"/&gt; This includes racial slurs and threats of violence, both of which create an uneasy environment in which the victims live.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lawhelp.org/documents/871H-06%20Housing%20Discrimination.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; These forms can cause excessive anxiety and stress for the individual or family affected. If an individual holding a position of an authority, such as the landlord, is responsible for the nonexclusionary discrimination, the victim is left with a feeling of powerlessness and lack of ability to get help.&lt;ref name="Roscigno, Vincent 2009"/&gt;

=== Disparate impact ===
Exclusionary and nonexclusionary describe the various disparate treatments that housing providers or agents can place upon renters and buyers. In addition to these types of housing discrimination, certain policies that do not discriminate on its face have also been found to cause housing discrimination in the United States. [[Disparate impact]] is a facially neutral housing policy that negatively impacts minorities or other protected groups of people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.justice.gov/crt/fcs/T6Manual7|title=Section VII- Proving Discrimination- Disparate Impact {{!}} CRT {{!}} Department of Justice|last=|first=|date=|website=www.justice.gov|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=28 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Disparate impact was not always looked at in the housing context. It was first applied in housing discrimination in 2015 when the Court found Congress had intended to include liability for disparate impact discrimination in the Fair Housing Act and its recognition is consistent with the central purpose of the Act since it was amended in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/crt/legacy/2015/06/25/tdhcainclusiveopinion.pdf|title=Texas Dept. of Housing and Community Affairs v. Inclusive Communities Project, Inc.|last=|first=|date=|website=The United States Department of Justice|page=3|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=28 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; After that case, HUD began recognizing many types of disparate impact treatment. For example, HUD published a statement concluding that blanket prohibitions against tenants with criminal convictions would constitute disparate impact housing discrimination because incarceration rates in the United States are disproportionate between minorities and non-minorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.hud.gov/sites/documents/HUD_OGCGUIDAPPFHASTANDCR.PDF|title=Office of General Counsel Guidance on Application of Fair Housing Act Standards to the Use of Criminal Records by Providers of Housing and Real Estate-Related Transactions|last=|first=|date=|website=U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development|pages=3–4|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=28 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Disparate impact remains controversial as some feel that their freedom in implementing policies and rules is now limited due to the fear of [[unintended consequences]] of rules that originally had no discriminatory intent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/clegg_testimony_06_21_07.pdf|title=Testimony of Roger Clegg|last=|first=|date=|website=Committee on the Judiciary|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=28 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Housing discrimination practices of today==
Professor of Public Administration and Economics&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://faculty.maxwell.syr.edu/jyinger/|title=John Yinger Professor of Public Administration and Economics|publisher=|accessdate=23 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and expert in the field of housing discrimination studies, [[John Milton Yinger|John Yinger]], argues that discriminatory housing practices in the housing market have led to segregation and can be interpreted as forms of modern-day discrimination. One important example cited is of realtors opting to place [[Public Housing|public housing]] in crowded [[inner city]] minority neighborhoods instead of those with an Anglo majority due to "public and political pressure." &lt;ref&gt;Russell, Marcia C. 2008. Fair Housing. Dearborn: Real Estate Education Company.&lt;/ref&gt; Other housing phenomena that Yinger argues encourage segregation are those of [[sorting]] and [[bidding]] in which bidders perceived to be higher-class win out on cheaper per-square-foot, larger homes farther away from inner cities.&lt;ref name="Yinger, John 2001"/&gt; The study done by the U.S. Housing Scholars adds that [[school zoning]] has also been named a culprit for housing segregation, and may be used as a critical venue for housing discrimination. It also cites the Internet as yet another means for the perpetuation of housing discrimination that is, as of now, unrestricted by the provisions of the Fair Housing Act. While the Fair Housing Act strictly prohibits any sellers from using language that explicitly names a preference for a certain group, third-party sellers that use sites like Craigslist.com and Roommates.com to find buyers or renters are granted immunity from the FHA, and the websites are not held liable. This was cemented by the 2004 court case, ''[[Fair Housing Council of San Fernando Valley v. Roommates.com, LLC]]'', in which Roommates.com was not held liable for users with advertisements such as, 'looking for White Christian Male,' since the website did not have the resources to monitor and censor such usage.&lt;ref name="prrac.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prrac.org/|title=PRRAC - Poverty &amp; Race Research Action Council|publisher=|accessdate=23 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===LGBT housing discrimination===
[[File:US LGBT housing discrimination.svg|thumb|350px|States that prohibit housing discrimination based on [[sexual orientation]] or [[gender identity]]. [[United States Department of Housing and Urban Development|HUD]] regulations require all housing providers that receive HUD funding not to discriminate against an individual's sexual orientation or gender identity.

{{legend|#d3d3d3|Does not factor sexual orientation or gender identity/unclear}}]]
Housing discrimination focuses more on race, but recent studies have shown a growing trend toward discrimination in the housing market against those who identify themselves as [[gay]], [[lesbian]], or [[transgender]]. Since housing discrimination based on sexual orientation was not explicitly cited in the Fair Housing Act, as of 2007, it was banned only in 17 states. In all states, same-sex couples are frequently unable to apply to public housing as a family unit, thus decreasing their chances at being accepted into the program.&lt;ref&gt;Cahil, Sean and Sarah Tobias. 2007. Policy Issues Affecting Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, and Transgender Families. Illinois: University of Michigan Press, 2007, {{ISBN|0-472-03061-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, in comprehensive study done by the Fair Housing Centers of Michigan in 2007, statistics showed that out of 120 paired-tests, almost 30 percent of same-sex couples were given higher rental rates and less encouragement to rent, both examples of nonexclusionary housing discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;"Fair Housing Commission of Michigan". 2008. Accessed December 3, 2010. &lt;www.fhcm.org&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; An HUD study released in 2011 surveyed of 6,450 transgender and gender non-conforming persons and found that "19 percent reported having been refused a house or an apartment because of gender identity."&lt;ref&gt;HUD Addresses LGBT Housing Discrimination October 13, 2011 http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2011/10/13/hud-addresses-lgbt-housing-discrimination&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 30, 2012, HUD Secretary [[Shaun Donovan]] announced new regulations that would require all housing providers that receive HUD funding to prevent housing discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://portal.hud.gov/hudportal/HUD?src=/press/press_releases_media_advisories/2012/HUDNo.12-014|title=HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan announces new regulations to ensure equal access to housing for all Americans regardless of sexual orientation or gender identity|publisher=[[United States Department of Housing and Urban Development]]|date=January 30, 2012|accessdate=March 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; These regulations went into effect on March 5, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://portal.hud.gov/hudportal/documents/huddoc?id=12lgbtfinalrule.pdf|title=Equal Access to Housing in HUD Programs Regardless of Sexual Orientation or Gender Identity|publisher=''[[Federal Register]]''|date=February 3, 2012|accessdate=March 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ethnic and racial minority housing discrimination===
Ethnic and racial minorities are impacted the most by housing discrimination. Exclusionary discrimination against African Americans most often occurs in rental markets and sales markets. Families are vulnerable to exclusion, but African American women are especially overrepresented as victims, especially single African American mothers. This discriminatory exclusion is because of stereotypes concerning race and single women. The presence of children in a minority family at times is what warrants the discrimination.&lt;ref name="South, S. J."/&gt; African Americans are also the victims in most nonexclusionary cases, with African American women still overrepresented. Nonexclusionary forms of discrimination such as racial slurs and intimidation affect many minority victims. Some racial minorities suffer the purposeful neglect of service needs, such as a landlord fixing a white tenant's bathtub quickly but delaying fixing the bathtub of the minority tenant.&lt;ref name="Roscigno, Vincent 2009"/&gt; Data obtained by Ohio Civil Rights Commission studied housing discrimination cases between 1988 and 2003, and of the 2,176 cases filed, 1,741 were filed by African Americans.&lt;ref name="Roscigno, Vincent 2009"/&gt; A study by HUD released in 2005 found that more and more Hispanics are facing discrimination in their housing searches.&lt;ref name="HUD study"/&gt; A 2011 article by HUD asserts that one out of five times, Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders receive less favorable treatment than others when they seek housing.&lt;ref&gt;HUD Let's Put an End to Housing Discrimination http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2011/05/12/let-s-put-end-housing-discrimination May 12, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Some cases brought to the Department of Justice show that municipalities and other local government entities violated the Fair Housing Act of 1968 when they denied African Americans housing, permits, and zoning changes, or steered them toward neighborhoods with a predominantly minority population.&lt;ref name="Justice"/&gt;

==Empirical evidence==
[[Quasi-experimental]] [[audit study|audit studies]], in which equally qualified individuals of different races both participate in housing searches, have found strong evidence of racial housing discrimination in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Pager |first=Devah |last2=Shepherd |first2=Hana |date=2008-01-01 |title=The Sociology of Discrimination: Racial Discrimination in Employment, Housing, Credit, and Consumer Markets |journal=Annual Review of Sociology |volume=34 |pages=181–209  |pmc=2915460 |pmid=20689680}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Demographics==
According to the U.S. Census of Population in 1990, 25.3 percent of all [[Non-Hispanic Whites|Anglo-Americans]] in the U.S. lived in central city areas. The percentage of [[African American]]s living in inner cities was 56.9 percent, and the percentage of inner city [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Hispanics]] was 51.5 percent. [[Asian American]]s living in central cities totaled 46.3 percent. According to a more recent U.S. Census Bureau study in 2002, the average white person living in a metropolitan area lives in a neighborhood that is 80 percent Anglo and seven percent black, while the average African American lives in a neighborhood that is 33 percent white and more than 51 percent black. As of 2000, 75 percent of all African Americans lived in highly segregated communities, making them the most segregated group in the nation.&lt;ref&gt;Committee on National Statistics. 2002. [https://books.google.com/books?id=lWvi0mwqCb8C&amp;printsec=frontcover "Measuring Housing Discrimination in a National Study"]. Angela Williams Foster, Faith Mitchell, and Stephen E. Fienberg (eds.) Washington, D.C.: National Academies Press. Massey, Douglas S. 2004 {{ISBN|0-309-08325-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; These statistics do not necessarily point to evidence of housing discrimination, but rather to segregation based on historical reasons which have made ethnic and racial minorities more economically deprived, and thus prone to living in more poverty-stricken inner city areas.

===HUD study===
In a comprehensive study by the HUD in 2000, paired-tests (in which two applicants of different races but the same economic status and credit scores apply to rent or buy a house) were used to determine whether or not statistics about segregation truly pointed to housing discrimination. This study reported that although adverse treatment of racial and ethnic minorities has decreased over time, roughly 25 percent of white applicants were still favored above those who were African-American or Hispanic. About 17 percent of African American applicants and 20 percent of Hispanic applicants were subjected to adverse treatment, including receiving less information about a home or being shown fewer, lower-quality units.&lt;ref&gt;Galster, George and Stephen Ross and Margaret Turner and John Yinger, 2002 [http://www.urban.org/publications/410821.html "Discrimination in Metropolitan Housing Markets: National Results from Phase 1 of the Housing Discrimination Study (HDS),"] Working papers 2002–16. University of Connecticut: Department of Economics.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effects of housing discrimination==
John Yinger, a sociologist who has studied housing discrimination, argues that it is something perhaps most concretely evidenced by its effects: [[concentrated poverty]]. People who suffer from housing discrimination often live in lower-quality housing. Housing inequalities often reflect the unequal distribution of income. Poor areas suffer from educational disparities, and a poor education translates into earnings disparities. Those who earn less can only afford lower-quality housing.&lt;ref name="Yinger, John 2001"/&gt; Segregation, health risks, and wealth disparities all relate to poverty.&lt;ref name="Shapiro, Thomas and Jessica Kenty-Drane 2005"/&gt;

===Residential segregation===
Perhaps the most unmistakable consequence of housing discrimination is [[residential segregation]]. Housing discrimination helps reinforce residential segregation through [[mortgage discrimination]], redlining, and predatory lending practices. Racial avoidance and threats of violence also result in racial segregation.&lt;ref name= "Shapiro, Thomas and Jessica Kenty-Drane 2005"/&gt; Housing discrimination can also impact minority preferences over time, as individuals or families experiencing harassment and intimidation at their home on a daily basis may transition to more accepting neighborhoods.&lt;ref name="Roscigno, Vincent 2009"/&gt;

===Health===
Health risks are a consequence of housing discrimination. Those suffering housing discrimination and people living below the poverty threshold often rent small or low-quality housing. Lead paint left over from past years and animal pests, such as rats, can be found in older housing, resulting in serious health consequences. [[Lead poisoning|Lead]] can lead to lowered intelligence in children.&lt;ref&gt;Pearce, JM (2007). "Burton's line in lead poisoning". European neurology 57 (2): 118–9.&lt;/ref&gt; Asthma is also a problem that comes with lower-quality housing, since more air pollution, dust, mold, and mildew are more likely to occur.&lt;ref name="Yinger, John 2001"/&gt;

===Neighborhood===
Neighborhood effects are also seen due to housing discrimination and residential segregation. The housing inequality that comes with living in lower-quality housing means that neighborhood amenities are lacking.&lt;ref&gt;Sen, Amartya K. 2004. "From Income Inequality to Economic Inequality," in C. Michael Henry (ed.) Race, Poverty, and Domestic Policy, New Haven and London: Yale University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Poorer areas offer worse education, leading to educational and employment disadvantages and a higher school dropout rate. Schools are often segregated due to the effects of housing discrimination and residential segregation, in turn hindering students' educational performance. A study conducted by the Century Foundation in Montgomery County, Md., showed that students from a low-income background enrolled in affluent schools did better than students in higher-poverty schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/22/opinion/22herbert.html?scp=10&amp;sq=housing%20discrimination&amp;st=cse | work=The New York Times | first=Bob | last=Herbert | title=Separate and Unequal | date=March 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Criminal activity, including gang life and drug abuse, is also more prevalent in poorer areas. The rate of teenage pregnancy has been shown to increase in these areas as well.&lt;ref name="Seitles, Marc"&gt;Seitles, Marc, 1996 [http://www.law.fsu.edu/journals/landuse/Vol141/seit.htm “The Perpetuation of Racial Residential Segregation in America: Historical Discrimination, Modern Forms of Exclusion, and Inclusionary Remedies,”] Florida State University College of Law.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wealth disparities===
Sociologists [[Thomas Shapiro]] and Jessica Kenty-Drane state that [[Wealth gap in the United States|wealth disparities]] are also a result of housing discrimination, as housing discrimination acts as a barrier to homeownership. Homeowners may learn management and home repair skills, and the children of homeowners are less likely to drop out of high school or to have children as teenagers. Additionally, credit constraints limit homeownership for people with low income. Housing discrimination that keeps families from affordable loans and nicer areas with increasing property values keep victims from accumulating wealth.&lt;ref name="Yinger, John 2001"/&gt; Residential segregation also leads to generational wealth disparities. Children often inherit wealth from their parents, and if parents were forced into poor-quality housing because of housing discrimination, then there is less wealth to hand down.&lt;ref name= "Shapiro, Thomas and Jessica Kenty-Drane 2005"/&gt;

==Possible solutions==
Sociologist Douglas Massey argues that housing discrimination is a moving target.&lt;ref name="Massey, Douglas S 2004"/&gt; As federal legislation concerning anti-housing discrimination policies become more effective, new forms of housing discrimination have emerged to perpetuate residential segregation, and in turn, poverty.&lt;ref name="Roscigno, Vincent 2009"/&gt;

There have been a number of solutions proposed to finally end the threat of housing discrimination and eliminate any legal loopholes in which it may operate. So far fair housing enforcement of federal legislation concerning housing discrimination has faced challenges. The main burden of enforcement falls on federal financial regulatory institutions, like the Federal Reserve Board, and the HUD.&lt;ref name="Yinger, John 2001"/&gt; The enforcement provisions of the Fair Housing Act of 1968 were limited, and even though the act was amended in 1988, there are still problems with enforcement since housing discrimination often happens one-on-one and is not very visible, even in audits.&lt;ref name="Yinger, John 2001"/&gt; The Fair Housing Amendment Act of 1988 did make a system of administrative law judges to hear housing discrimination cases to help against the illegal actions. Other examples of federal legislation may include increased federal legislation enforcement, scattered-site housing,&lt;ref name="Yinger, John 2001"/&gt; or state and local enforcement on a more concentrated level.&lt;ref name="prrac.org"/&gt; Better methods of enforcement in addition to new policies are proposed to be a help. In 2010 the Justice Department under President Barack Obama made a new fair-lending unit.&lt;ref name="Fair Lending and Accountability"/&gt;

Inclusionary remedies to truly enforce [[Racial integration|integration]] are also proposed. Inclusionary housing refers to making sure that areas are integrated, and inclusionary housing increases chances for racial minorities to gain and sustain employment.&lt;ref name="Seitles, Marc"/&gt; Recently Montgomery County, Md., passed an ordinance to require new housing developments to consist of a percentage of moderately priced dwelling units, guaranteeing more affordable better housing for 10 years.&lt;ref&gt;Florence W. Roisman &amp; Hilary Botein, Housing Mobility and Life Opportunities, 27 CLEARINGHOUSE REV. 335, 348 (1993)&lt;/ref&gt;

Other proposed solutions include [[subsidies]], such as direct subsidies, project-based subsidies, household-based subsidies, and tax reductions.&lt;ref name="Yinger, John 2001"/&gt; As of 2001, only 15.7 percent of poor households received federal housing subsidies, meaning a majority of people in poor households did not receive that help. Household-based subsidies have been a significant source of new housing assistance as of late.&lt;ref name="Yinger, John 2001"/&gt; HUD has handed out housing certificates to allow participants of [[Section 8 (housing)|Section 8]] to move into higher-quality housing units.&lt;ref name= "Yinger, John 2001"/&gt;

It is important to prioritize policy and city planning. Planning for sustainability does not come with a one-size fits all approach; wicked problems persist without clarity or solutions. However, looking beyond urban regimes and accepting the nexus of these regimes is the first step for change that planners can take. This can be done through the notion of Equitable Development, an approach that aims to create communities of opportunity. Inequalities oppressing low-income communities composed of diverse ethnicities are not only unethical but prove to be economically and environmentally unsustainable. Partnership between government, private sectors, and community-based organizations to manipulate public policy for the promotion of social equity, as well as, economic growth and environmental sustainability are crucial for justice.&lt;ref&gt;Blackwell, Angela Glover. "Promoting Equitable Development." (n.d.): n. pag. Web.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[economics]], an '''input–output model''' is a quantitative economic technique that represents the interdependencies between different branches of a national economy or different regional economies.&lt;ref name="ref"&gt;Thijs Ten Raa, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=nu0FAvNiFhYC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Input–output economics: theory and applications: featuring Asian economies]'', World Scientific, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; [[Wassily Leontief]] (1906–1999) is credited with developing this type of analysis and earned the [[Nobel Prize in Economics]] for his development of this model.&lt;ref name="ref"/&gt;

==Origins==
[[Francois Quesnay]] had developed a cruder version of this technique called [[Tableau économique]], and [[Léon Walras]]'s work ''Elements of Pure Economics'' on [[general equilibrium theory]] also was a forerunner and made a generalization of Leontief's seminal concept.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Éléments d'économie politique pure, ou théorie de la richesse sociale |trans-title=Elements of Pure Economics, or The Theory of Social Wealth |first=L. |last=Walras |location= |publisher= |year=1874 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alexander Bogdanov]] has been credited with originating the concept in a report delivered to the [[First Conference on Scientific Organization of Labour|All Russia Conference on the Scientific Organisation of Labour and Production Processes]], in January 1921.&lt;ref name=Belykh&gt;{{cite journal|last=Belykh|first=A. A.|title=A Note on the Origins of Input-Output Analysis and the Contribution of the Early Soviet Economists: Chayanov, Bogdanov and Kritsman|journal=Soviet Studies|date=July 1989|volume=41|issue=3|pages=426–429|doi=10.1080/09668138908411823}}&lt;/ref&gt; This approach was also developed by L. N. Kritsman and T. F. Remington, who has argued that their work provided a link between Quesnay's tableau économique and the subsequent contributions by [[Vladimir Groman]] and [[Vladimir Bazarov]] to [[Gosplan]]'s method of [[material balance planning]].&lt;ref name=Belykh /&gt;

Wassily Leontief's work in the input-output model was influenced by the works of the classical economists [[Karl Marx]] and [[Jean Charles Léonard de Sismondi]]. Karl Marx's economics provided an early outline involving a set of tables where the economy consisted of two interlinked departments.&lt;ref name="Planning and the Real Origins of Input-Output Analysis, 1984"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Planning and the Real Origins of Input-Output Analysis |first=D. L. |last=Clark |year=1984 |journal=Journal of Contemporary Asia |volume=14 |issue=4 |pages=408–429 |doi=10.1080/00472338485390301 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Leontief was the first to use a [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] representation of a national (or regional) economy.

== Basic derivation ==
The model depicts inter-industry relationships within an economy, showing how output from one industrial sector may become an input to another industrial sector. In the inter-industry matrix, column entries typically represent inputs to an industrial sector, while row entries represent outputs from a given sector. This format therefore shows how dependent each sector is on every other sector, both as a customer of outputs from other sectors and as a supplier of inputs. Each column of the input–output [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] shows the monetary value of inputs to each sector and each row represents the value of each sector's outputs.

Say that we have an economy with &lt;math&gt; n &lt;/math&gt; sectors. Each sector produces &lt;math&gt; x_i &lt;/math&gt; units of a single homogeneous good. Assume that the &lt;math&gt; j &lt;/math&gt;th sector, in order to produce 1 unit, must use &lt;math&gt; a_{ij} &lt;/math&gt; units from sector &lt;math&gt; i &lt;/math&gt;. Furthermore, assume that each sector sells some of its output to other sectors (intermediate output) and some of its output to consumers (final output, or final demand). Call final demand in the &lt;math&gt; i &lt;/math&gt;th sector &lt;math&gt; d_i &lt;/math&gt;. Then we might write

:&lt;math&gt;

x_i = a_{i1}x_1 + a_{i2}x_2 + \ldots + a_{in}x_n + d_i,

&lt;/math&gt;

or total output equals intermediate output plus final output. If we let &lt;math&gt; A &lt;/math&gt; be the matrix of coefficients &lt;math&gt; a_{ij} &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt; x &lt;/math&gt; be the vector of total output, and &lt;math&gt; d &lt;/math&gt; be the vector of final demand, then our expression for the economy becomes

:&lt;math&gt;

x = Ax + d

&lt;/math&gt;

which after re-writing becomes &lt;math&gt; (I - A)x = d &lt;/math&gt;. If the matrix &lt;math&gt; I - A &lt;/math&gt; is invertible then this is a linear system of equations with a unique solution, and so given some final demand vector the required output can be found. Furthermore, if the principal [[Minor (linear algebra)|minors]] of the matrix &lt;math&gt; I - A &lt;/math&gt; are all positive (known as the [[Hawkins–Simon condition]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Nikaido |first=H. |title=Introduction to Sets and Mappings in Modern Economics |location=New York |publisher=Elsevier |year=1970 |isbn=0-444-10038-5 |pages=13–19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the required output vector &lt;math&gt; x &lt;/math&gt; is non-negative.

=== Example ===

Consider an economy with two goods, A and B. The matrix of coefficients and the final demand is given by

:&lt;math&gt;

A = \left(\begin{array}{cc} 0.5 &amp; 0.2 \\ 0.4 &amp; 0.1 \end{array}\right) \text{ and } d = \left(\begin{array}{c} 7 \\ 4 \end{array}\right).

&lt;/math&gt;

Intuitively, this corresponds to finding the amount of output each sector should produce given that we want 7 units of good A and 4 units of good B. Then solving the system of linear equations derived above gives us

:&lt;math&gt;

x = (I - A)^{-1} d = \left(\begin{array}{c} 19.19 \\ 12.97 \end{array}\right).

&lt;/math&gt;

=== Further research ===

There is an extensive literature on these models. There is the Hawkins–Simon condition on producibility. There has been research on disaggregation to clustered inter-industry flows, and on the study of constellations of industries. A great deal of empirical work has been done to identify coefficients, and data has been published for the national economy as well as for regions. The Leontief system can be extended to a model of general equilibrium; it offers a method of decomposing work done at a macro level.

=== Introducing transportation ===

Transportation is implicit in the notion of inter-industry flows. It is explicitly recognized when transportation is identified as an industry – how much is purchased from transportation in order to produce. But this is not very satisfactory because transportation requirements differ, depending on industry locations and capacity constraints on regional production. Also, the receiver of goods generally pays freight cost, and often transportation data are lost because transportation costs are treated as part of the cost of the goods.

[[Walter Isard]] and his student, [[Leon Moses]], were quick to see the spatial economy and transportation implications of input–output, and began work in this area in the 1950s developing a concept of interregional input–output. Take a one region versus the world case. We wish to know something about interregional commodity flows, so introduce a column into the table headed "exports" and we introduce an "import" row.

A more satisfactory way to proceed would be to tie regions together at the industry level. That is, we could identify both intra-region inter-industry transactions and inter-region inter-industry transactions. The problem here is that the table grows quickly.

Input–output is conceptually simple. Its extension to a model of equilibrium in the national economy has been done successfully using high-quality data. One who wishes to do work with input–output systems must deal skillfully with industry classification, data estimation, and inverting very large, ill-conditioned matrices. Moreover, changes in relative prices are not readily handled by this modeling approach alone. Of course, input–output accounts are part and parcel to a more flexible form of modeling, [[Computable general equilibrium]] models.

Two additional difficulties are of interest in transportation work. There is the question of substituting one input for another, and there is the question about the stability of coefficients as production increases or decreases. These are intertwined questions. They have to do with the nature of regional production functions.

==Usefulness==

Because the input–output model is fundamentally linear in nature, it lends itself to rapid computation as well as flexibility in computing the effects of changes in demand. Input–output models for different regions can also be linked together to investigate the effects of inter-regional trade, and additional columns can be added to the table to perform [[environmentally extended input-output analysis]] (EEIOA). For example, information on fossil fuel inputs to each sector can be used to investigate flows of embodied carbon within and between different economies.

The structure of the input–output model has been incorporated into national accounting in many developed countries, and as such can be used to calculate important measures such as national GDP. Input–output economics has been used to study regional economies within a nation, and as a tool for national and regional economic planning. A main use of input–output analysis is to measure the economic impacts of events as well as public investments or programs as shown by [[IMPLAN]] and [[Regional Input-Output Modeling System]]. It is also used to identify economically related industry clusters and also so-called "key" or "target" industries (industries that are most likely to enhance the internal coherence of a specified economy). By linking industrial output to satellite accounts articulating energy use, effluent production, space needs, and so on, input–output analysts&lt;!-- Who? --&gt; have extended&lt;!-- Font? --&gt; the approaches application to a wide variety of uses.

===Input-output and socialist planning===
The input-output model is one of the major conceptual models for a [[socialist]] [[planned economy]]. This model involves the direct determination of physical quantities to be produced in each industry, which is used to formulate a consistent economic plan of resource allocation. This method of planning is contrasted with price-directed [[Lange model|Lange-model socialism]] and Soviet-style [[material balance planning]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Loucks|first1=William Negele|last2=Whitney|first2=William G.|title=Comparative Economic Systems|date=1973|publisher=Harper &amp; Row|isbn=9780060440459|pages=178–179|edition=9th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the economy of the [[Soviet Union]], planning was conducted using the method of material balances up until the country's dissolution. The method of material balances was first developed in the 1930s during the Soviet Union's rapid industrialization drive. Input-output planning was never adopted because the material balance system had become entrenched in the Soviet economy, and input-output planning was shunned for ideological reasons. As a result, the benefits of consistent and detailed planning through input-output analysis was never realized in the [[Analysis of Soviet-type economic planning|Soviet-type economies]].&lt;ref&gt;''Towards A New Socialism'', 1993, by Paul cockshott and Allin Cottrell. Coronet Books Inc. 978-0851245454. "Planning in the USSR", (P.79)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Measuring input–output tables ==

The mathematics of input–output economics is straightforward, but the data requirements are enormous because the expenditures and revenues of each branch of economic activity have to be represented. As a result, not all countries collect the required data and data quality varies, even though a set of standards for the data's collection has been set out by the United Nations through its System of National Accounts (SNA):&lt;ref&gt;[http://unstats.un.org/unsd/nationalaccount/sna.asp About SNA], UN&lt;/ref&gt; the most recent standard is the 2008 SNA. Because the data collection and preparation process for the input–output accounts is necessarily labor and computer intensive, input–output tables are often published long after the year in which the data were collected—typically as much as 5–7 years after. Moreover, the economic "snapshot" that the benchmark version of the tables provides of the economy's cross-section is typically taken only once every few years, at best.

However, many developed countries estimate input–output accounts annually and with much greater recency. This is because while most uses of the input–output analysis focus on the matrix set of inter-industry exchanges, the actual focus of the analysis from the perspective of most national statistical agencies is the [[benchmarking]] of [[gross domestic product]]. Input–output tables therefore are an instrumental part of [[national accounts]]. As suggested above, the core input–output table reports only intermediate goods and services that are exchanged among industries. But an array of row [[vector (geometric)|vector]]s, typically aligned at the bottom of this matrix, record non-industrial inputs by industry like payments for labor; indirect business taxes; dividends, interest, and rents; capital consumption allowances (depreciation); other property-type income (like profits); and purchases from foreign suppliers (imports). At a national level, although excluding the imports, when summed this is called "gross product originating" or "gross domestic product by industry." Another array of column vectors is called "final demand" or "gross product consumed." This displays columns of spending by households, governments, changes in industry stocks, and industries on investment, as well as net exports. (See also Gross domestic product.) In any case, by employing the results of an economic census which asks for the sales, payrolls, and material/equipment/service input of each establishment, statistical agencies back into estimates of industry-level profits and investments using the input–output matrix as a sort of double-accounting framework.

==Input–output analysis versus consistency analysis==
Despite the clear ability of the input-output model to depict and analyze the dependence of one industry or sector on another, Leontief and others never managed to introduce the full spectrum of dependency relations in a market economy. In 2003, Mohammad Gani [https://web.archive.org/web/20070826172321/http://sb.iub.edu.bd/Dr_Mohammad_Osman_Gani.html], a pupil of Leontief, introduced [[consistency analysis]] in his book 'Foundations of Economic Science' ({{ISBN|984320655X}}), which formally looks exactly like the input–output table but explores the dependency relations in terms of payments and intermediation relations. Consistency analysis explores the consistency of plans of buyers and sellers by decomposing the input–output table into four matrices, each for a different kind of means of payment. It integrates micro and macroeconomics into one model and deals with money in a value-free manner. It deals with the flow of funds via the movement of goods.

'''Intact America''' is a registered non-governmental [[Intactivist]] (pro-intact or anti-infant circumcision) organization created in 2008 to advance the view that the [[circumcision]] of non-consenting minors is [[Circumcision controversies|unethical and medically unnecessary]], and therefore should be abandoned.&lt;ref name="ia-pressrelease"&gt;{{cite news |title=Intact America Launches Campaign to Change How America Thinks About Male Circumcision |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/pressRelease/idUS153241+25-Jun-2009+PRN20090625 |publisher=Reuters (republished press release) | date=June 25, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also claim that circumcision reduces sexual sensation in males and that it is a violation of modern bio-ethical standards to forcibly remove erogenous tissue from children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Who We Are |url=http://www.intactamerica.org/node/4 |publisher=Intact America}}&lt;/ref&gt; The activist organization uses traditional media, social-networking, lobbying, demonstrating, and other methods to encourage social change. The group has been mentioned in the Chicago Tribune,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Circumcision: Change in medical opinion possible |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2009-08-27/news/0908270167_1_male-circumcision-hiv-infection-medical-groups |date=August 27, 2009 |publisher=Chicago Tribune}}&lt;/ref&gt; New York Times,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Circumcise or Don't?

==Participation in public policy debate on circumcision==
{{Further information|Circumcision in the United States}}
In June 2009, Intact America issued a public statement regarding the [[Centers for Disease Control]]'s (CDC) conference on [[HIV]], in which the group urged the CDC "to study the risks and ethics before recommending neonatal male circumcision." Intact America stated that "The CDC is moving down a path towards an indefensible recommendation in favor of subjecting newborn baby boys to unnecessary and potentially risky surgery with no medical benefit."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Intact America Urges CDC to Study Risks and Ethics Before Recommending Neonatal Male Circumcision |publisher=Intact America |date=August 24, 2009 |url=http://www.intactamerica.org/node/34/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 19, 2009, Intact America placed an open letter in the Washington Post addressed to the [[American Academy of Pediatrics]] (AAP), urging the AAP to inform parents about the ethical and health implications of circumcision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Intact America Urges Pediatricians to Say No to Infant Circumcision--The Baby, Not The Parent, Is Your Patient |date=October 19, 2009 |publisher=Washington Post | url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/intact-america-urges-pediatricians-to-say-no-to-infant-circumcision---the-baby-not-the-parent-is-your-patient-64725842.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the AAP released its new circumcision policy statement on August 27, 2012,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Technical Report: Male Circumcision |publisher=AAP |date=August 27, 2012 |url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/early/2012/08/22/peds.2012-1990.full.pdf+html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Intact America formally demanded that the AAP retract the statement on the grounds that the policy was biased and did not protect the child's rights, "It appears that the AAP is acting more as a trade association for doctors who perform this unnecessary surgery more than 1 million times a year, instead of standing up for the human rights and [[bodily integrity]] of the only patient that counts—the baby boy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Intact America’s Response to the American Academy of Pediatrics 2012 Report on Circumcision |publisher=Intact America |date=August 27, 2012 |url=http://www.intactamerica.org/aap2012_response}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2013, Intact America applied for a booth inside the exhibit hall of the annual convention of the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG). When the ACOG denied this application because "male circumcision is … of only casual interest to members of ACOG." Intact America staged a protest outside the convention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Intactivists Call on Obstetricians Meeting in New Orleans to Stop Cutting Baby Boys|url=http://www.intactamerica.org/pr_050213}}&lt;/ref&gt; Obstetricians perform the majority of the million circumcisions that take place each year in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stang|first=HJ|author2=Snellman LW|title=Circumcision Practice Patterns in the United States|journal=Pediatrics|year=1998|volume=101|issue=8|page=e5|doi=10.1542/peds.101.6.e5|pmid=9606247}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''International Clearing Union''' ('''ICU''') was one of the institutions proposed to be set up at the 1944 [[United Nations Monetary and Financial Conference]] at [[Bretton Woods, New Hampshire]], in the [[United States]], by [[British people|British]] economist [[John Maynard Keynes]]. Its aim was to have been regulation of currency exchange, a role eventually taken by the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF). 

The International Clearing Union (ICU) would be a global bank whose job would be the clearance of trade between nations, similar to a [[trade exchange]] with every country as a member. All international trade would be denominated in its own unit of account, the proposed [[bancor]]. The bancor was to have had a [[fixed exchange rate]] with national currencies, and would have been used to measure the [[balance of trade]] between nations. Every good exported would add bancors to a country's account, every good imported would subtract them.  Each nation would be [[Incentives#Incentive_in_economics|incentivized]] to keep their bancor balance close to zero. If a nation had too high a bancor surplus the ICU would take a percentage of that surplus and put it into the Clearing Union's [[Foreign-exchange reserves|Reserve Fund]]; this would encourage nations with surpluses to buy other nations' exports. Nations that imported more than they exported would have their currency depreciated against the bancor; encouraging other nations to buy their products, and making imports more expensive. Gold and national currency would no longer be used in international trade and no longer move between countries.

'''John George I''' (German: '''Johann Georg I.''') (5 March 1585 – 8 October 1656) was [[Elector of Saxony]] from 1611 to 1656.

==Biography==
[[Image:Johann-Georg-Denkmal.jpg|thumb|left|220px|Monument to John George in Johanngeorgstadt.]]
Born in [[Dresden]], John George was the second son of the Elector [[Christian I of Saxony|Christian I]] and [[Sophie of Brandenburg]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=459}} He belonged to the Albertine line of the [[House of Wettin]].
[[File:Anselmus-van-Hulle-Hommes-illustres MG 0440.tif|thumb|Engraving of John George I, Elector of Saxony. [[Anselm van Hulle]].]]
[[File:Dankaerts-Historis-9345.tif|thumb|Engraving, Cornelis Danckaerts Historis, 1642]]
John George succeeded to the electorate on 23 June 1611 on the death of his elder brother, [[Christian II of Saxony|Christian II]]. The geographical position of the [[Electorate of Saxony]] rather than her high standing among the German Protestants gave her ruler much importance during the [[Thirty Years' War]]. At the beginning of his reign, however, the new elector took up a somewhat detached position. His personal allegiance to [[Lutheranism]] was sound, but he liked neither the growing strength of [[Brandenburg]] nor the increasing prestige of the [[Electoral Palatinate|Palatinate]]; the adherence of the other branches of the Saxon ruling house to Protestantism seemed to him to suggest that the head of the [[Electorate of Saxony]] should throw his weight into the other scale, and he was prepared to favour the advances of the [[Habsburg]]s and the [[Roman Catholic]] party.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=459}}

Thus John George was easily induced to vote for the election of [[Ferdinand II, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand, Archduke of Styria]], as emperor in August 1619, an action which nullified the anticipated opposition of the Protestant electors. The new emperor secured the help of John George for the impending campaign in [[Bohemia]] by promising that he should be undisturbed in his possession of certain ecclesiastical lands. Carrying out his share of the bargain by occupying [[Silesia]] and [[Lusatia]], where he displayed much clemency, the Saxon elector had thus some part in driving [[Frederick V, Elector Palatine|Frederick V]], elector palatine of the Rhine, from Bohemia and in crushing Protestantism in that country, the crown of which he himself had previously refused.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=459}}
[[File:Porträtt, Johann Georg I av Sachsen - Skoklosters slott - 87718.tif|thumb|Johann Georg I of Saxony, 1613]]
Gradually, however, he was made uneasy by the obvious trend of the imperial policy towards the annihilation of Protestantism, and by a dread lest the ecclesiastical lands should be taken from him; and the issue of the edict of restitution in March 1629 put the [[wikt:capstone|capstone]] to his fears. Still, although clamouring vainly for the exemption of the electorate from the area covered by the edict, John George took no decisive  measures to break his alliance with the emperor. He did, indeed, in February 1631 call a meeting of Protestant princes at [[Leipzig]], but in spite of the appeals of the preacher [[Matthias Hoe von Hohenegg]] (1580–1645) he contented himself with a formal protest.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=459}}

Meanwhile, [[Gustavus Adolphus]] had landed in Germany, aiming to relieve [[Magdeburg]]. Gustavus attempted to conclude an alliance with John George to allow him to cross the [[Elbe]] at [[Wittenberg]], but John George remained hesitant to join the Protestant cause and the discussions went nowhere. Hoping that an alliance would be concluded eventually, Gustavus avoided any military action.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=459}}

[[Johan Tzerclaes, Count of Tilly|Tilly]], commander of the [[Army of the Holy Roman Empire|main imperial force]], was also concerned about the possibility of an alliance, no matter how unlikely it was at the time. In order to preempt any such move, he invaded Saxony and started to ravage the countryside. This had the effect of driving John George into the alliance he had hoped to preempt, which was concluded in September 1631. The Saxon troops were present at the [[battle of Breitenfeld (1631)|battle of Breitenfeld]], but were routed by the imperialists, the elector himself seeking safety in flight.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=459}}

Nevertheless, he soon took the offensive. Marching into Bohemia the Saxons occupied [[Prague]], but John George soon began to negotiate for peace and consequently his soldiers offered little resistance to [[Wallenstein]], who drove them back into Saxony. However, for the present the efforts of Gustavus Adolphus prevented the elector from deserting him, but the position was changed by the death of the king at [[Battle of Lützen (1632)|Lützen]] in 1632, and the refusal of Saxony to join the Protestant league under Swedish leadership.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=459}}

Still letting his troops fight in a desultory fashion against the imperialists, John George again negotiated for peace, and in May 1635 he concluded the important [[treaty of Prague (1635)|treaty of Prague]] with Ferdinand II. His reward was Lusatia and certain other additions of territory; the retention by his son Augustus of the [[archbishopric of Magdeburg]]; and some concessions with regard to the edict of restitution. Almost at once he declared war upon the Swedes, but in October 1636 he was [[battle of Wittstock|beaten at Wittstock]]; and Saxony, ravaged impartially by both sides, was soon in a deplorable condition. At length in September 1645 the elector was compelled to agree to a truce with the Swedes, who, however, retained [[Leipzig]]; and as far as Saxony was concerned this ended the Thirty Years' War. After the [[peace of Westphalia]], which with regard to Saxony did little more than confirm the treaty of Prague, John George died on 8 October 1656.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=459}}

==Assessment==
Although not without political acumen, John George was not a great ruler; his character appears to have been harsh and unlovely, and he was addicted to drink and other diversions such as hunting.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=459}}

==Family and children==
John George was married twice. In addition to his successor [[John George II, Elector of Saxony|John George II]], he left three sons, [[Augustus, Duke of Saxe-Weissenfels|Augustus]] (1614–1680), [[Christian I, Duke of Saxe-Merseburg|Christian]] (died 1691) and [[Maurice, Duke of Saxe-Zeitz|Maurice]] (died 1681).{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=459}}

In [[Dresden]] on 16 September 1604 Johann Georg married firstly [[Sibylle Elisabeth of Württemberg|Sibylle Elisabeth]], daughter of [[Frederick I, Duke of Württemberg]]. She died in the birth of their only child:

{{Libertarianism sidebar |Aspects}}
Many countries and subnational political entities have '''[[libertarianism|libertarian]] political parties'''. Although these parties may describe themselves as "libertarian," their ideologies differ considerably and not all of them support all elements of the libertarian agenda.

It is 9 miles from  [[Twin Oaks Community]] which helped support LEF when it was being founded. 

== Purpose ==

LEF is a "neo-Amish"&lt;ref name="Central Virginian" /&gt; farm and educational center.&lt;ref name="FIC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://directory.ic.org/22898/Living_Energy_Farm|title=The Fellowship for Intentional Community Directory}}&lt;/ref&gt; The farm grows crops and maintains orchards utilizing the methods of [[organic horticulture]]. Because of its fossil fuel avoidance, LEF relies on draft animals and tractors with [[wood gas]] engines that run directly off woodchips or other cellulosic debris.&lt;ref name="Central Virginian" /&gt;

The building and homes on the property are "green,"&lt;ref name="Central Virginian" /&gt; insulated and built with low-tech, local materials such as straw bales, rocks, and clay. [[Photovoltaic electricity]], [[composting toilets]], and [[greywater]] systems are integral to the community. In the winter, living spaces will be warmed with solar heating, and a natural cross ventilation will cool the buildings in the summer months.&lt;ref name="Central Virginian" /&gt;

The community aims to sustain itself financially by growing seeds for organic seed companies, selling organic fruits and vegetables&lt;ref name="Central Virginian" /&gt; and offering classes to the public.&lt;ref name="FIC" /&gt;

== Other Energy Usages ==

For food preparation, members of the Living Energy Farm will utilize several technologies, including [[thermal storage]], [[wood pyrolysis]] and [[solar cookers]]. A solar ammonia loop system now being used in various countries throughout the world will provide refrigeration. The system will have no electronic or moving parts and can be built out of low-cost materials.&lt;ref name="Central Virginian" /&gt;
 
[[Steam power]] and non-battery [[solar energy]] (a DC micro-grid) satisfy other general energy needs. Bicycles are used for transportation.&lt;ref name="Central Virginian" /&gt;

The community will also have a location with access to the Internet and a telephone in order to be able to connect with the outside world.&lt;ref name="Central Virginian" /&gt;&lt;ref name="FIC" /&gt;

== Outreach ==

LEF hosts interns in an educational program covering diverse areas of modern sustainable living. The community aims to teach people, especially youths, about the importance of sustainable technology in context (i.e. when and where such technologies are effective and when they are not).&lt;ref name="FIC" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6106">'''Mary Thipe''' was a [[South African]] anti-apartheid and human rights activist who took part in the [[1956 Women's March]] against apartheid pass laws, the [[South African potato boycott]] of 1959 and the [[Cato Manor]] Beer Hall boycott in the same year. Thipe was also the vice-chairperson of the [[Cato Manor]] branch of [[African National Congress Women's League]] (ANCWL) during the 1950s.&lt;ref name="Thipe1"&gt;{{cite web| title=Mary Thipe    |publisher=The Presidency| url=http://www.thepresidency.gov.za/national-orders/recipient/mary-thipe-posthumous| accessdate=25 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==

Mary Thipe was born in 1917 in a village called Ramhlakoane in the [[Matatiele]] district in the [[Eastern Cape]], [[South Africa]]. She later moved to Umkhumbane in [[KwaZulu Natal]] and joined the liberation struggle in 1952.&lt;ref name="Thipe1"/&gt; Thipe had six children, five daughters and one son. After joining the struggle for liberation, Thipe was arrested on numerous occasions, making it difficult to spend time with her children. In describing her upbringing, Thipe's daughter Maeketso said: "We were raised by our father and some of our neighbours because my mother was arrested so many times. Sometimes people would laugh at us telling us our mother was in jail. It was hard. My mother never ever had a good life." Thipe died of a heart attack in 1982.&lt;ref name="Thipe2"&gt;{{cite web| title=Daughter honours late anti-apartheid activist mother|publisher=SABC| url=http://www.sabc.co.za/news/a/16b23f004dcdd13bb72bffbc7090c397/Daughterundefinedhonoursundefinedlateundefinedanti-apartheidundefinedactivistundefinedmother-20160908| accessdate=25 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political work==

Mary Thipe joined the [[ANC]] during the [[Defiance Campaign]] of 1952. Thipe went on to become vice-chairperson of the [[Cato Manor]] branch of the [[African National Congress Women's League]] (ANCWL). She took a train from [[Cato Manor]], [[KwaZulu-Natal]] to [[Pretoria]] to join hundreds of women who marched against pass laws on August 9, 1956. In an interview with the [[SABC]], Thipe's daughter Maeketso said her mother refused to own a pass. "One day they [apartheid police] came to our house. It was in the middle of the day and they came and wanted to see her dompass. She didn't have it and she told them that she would not carry it. They arrested her. She spent two weeks in jail," Maeketso said.&lt;ref name="Thipe2"/&gt;

On 26 June 1959, Thipe and leaders of the [[ANC]]-aligned [[South African Congress of Trade Unions]] and [[Congress Alliance]], launched the national potato boycott in response to the unsatisfactory working conditions of labourers in Bethal in the Eastern Transvaal, now known as [[Mpumalanga]]. Over 60, 000 people attended the launch of the boycott at Currie's Fountain in [[Durban]]. The boycott lasted until September 1959 after the farmers improved the conditions in the farms. The boycott is seen as one of the most successful boycotts led by the ANC and allies during the apartheid era.
On 17 June 1959, women led by Thipe and Dorothy Nyembe  attacked the [[Cato Manor]] beer hall, forced their way inside, beating the men drinking there and wrecking the place. Rioting continued the next day and beer halls in other parts of town were attacked. This riot was organised to stop men from drinking sorghum beer while their children and wives starved.&lt;ref name="Thipe1"/&gt;

Thipe's political work caught the attention of the apartheid government. She was put under house arrest for 10 years which meant she could not attend church services, funeral services of her loved ones and was not allowed to be in the company of more than three people. Every Monday morning, Thipe was required to report at the [[Cato Manor]] police station. This did not stop the security branch from harassing her even in her house arrest.&lt;ref name="Thipe1"/&gt;

She had trained her children that each time police came in the middle of the night, they would wake up and stand behind her. She had also trained them to look at the police in the eye and not flinch. When three of Thipe's children went into exile, the police intensified their terror on Thipe and her family.&lt;ref name="Thipe1"/&gt;  "They would come wake us up, wanting to know where our siblings are. When I went to college, they had someone keep tabs on me. They told me I am not allowed to participate in politics because my family was already in big trouble," said Thipe's daughter Maeketsi in an interview with SABC.&lt;ref name="Thipe2"/&gt;

When the police threatened to find Thipe's grandson and kill him, she retorted by requesting that they bring his head back to her. She refused to show fear and flinch at their threats. Even in the house arrest Thipe found ways to continue her work with the ANCWL, organising funerals of fallen comrades.&lt;ref name="Thipe1"/&gt;

== Legacy==

Thipe is regarded as one of the women who were instrumental in the fight against apartheid in South Africa. A road in [[Durban]] is named after Thipe in honour of her work in the Chesterville and Ntuzuma townships of [[Durban]].&lt;ref name="Thipe1"/&gt; The Mary Thipe Scholarship, which seeks to help students from poor families was launched in honour of her political work in Umkhumbane, [[Cato Manor]] and Chesterville in 2001.&lt;ref name="Thipe3"&gt;{{cite web| title=Fund named after struggle stalwart|publisher=Izwi| url=http://www.cmda.org.za/IZWI/Izwi_Mar01_pg2.htm| accessdate=25 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2015, she was awarded the Order of Luthuli in Silver for her contributions to the South African struggle for freedom.&lt;ref name="Thipe1"/&gt;

Though María Rosa was born in Madrid, at the age of 3 she followed her father's professional lot and in her early childhood the family moved from the capital to Burgos&lt;ref&gt;J.F.F., ''Urraca Pastor (María Rosa)'' entry, [in:] ''Enciclopedia Espasa'', Supplement, Madrid 1935 [1980 reprint, {{ISBN|8423945847}}], p. 179&lt;/ref&gt; and then to Bilbao.&lt;ref&gt;''María Rosa Urraca Pastor, Así empezaron'', [in:] ''Fundacion Nacional Francisco Franco'' website, available [http://www.fnff.es/Maria_Rosa_Urraca_Pastor_Asi_empezaron_914_c.htm here]&lt;/ref&gt; She was raised in fervently Catholic ambience, as her father was member of a number of local religious societies like Hermandad de Nuestra Señora de Valvanera;&lt;ref&gt;''La Vanguardia'' 24.04.65&lt;/ref&gt; he passed the pious zeal to the daughter.&lt;ref&gt;„a él [father] y a mi madre debo el caldo de cultivo en que crecí: familia profundamente cristiana y practicante", ''La Vanguardia'' 05.11.82, available [http://hemeroteca.lavanguardia.com/preview/1982/11/05/pagina-6/32955578/pdf.html here]&lt;/ref&gt; Nothing is known of political views of María's parents, except that her father was a non-Carlist [[monarchist]].&lt;ref&gt;''La Vanguardia'' 26.01.72, available [http://hemeroteca.lavanguardia.com/preview/1972/01/26/pagina-41/34279217/pdf.html here]; in 1982 she confirmed that „no soy hija de carlista", ''La Vanguardia'' 05.11.82&lt;/ref&gt; Another feature of her upbringing was profound respect for the military, considered „backbone of the nation".&lt;ref&gt;Andrés Prieto 2012, p. 49&lt;/ref&gt; Her early formation was completed by books; she later admitted that at the age of 14 she had been profoundly moved by the works [[Concepción Arenal]]&lt;ref&gt;''La Vanguardia'' 26.01.72, Moral Roncal 2013, p. 65&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Graciano Martínez]].&lt;ref&gt;Moral Roncal 2011, p. 202, Moral Roncal 2013, p. 65&lt;/ref&gt; The former advocated active public stance of women in the modern society; the latter, a Catholic friar, pursued the regenerationist path by focusing on social work of the Christians, also underlining the role of females.

It is not clear where María received her primary education; she later frequented Escuela Normal Superior de Maestras de Vizcaya, graduating in 1923.&lt;ref&gt;Andrés Prieto 2012, p. 25, 41, Moral Roncal 2011, p. 201&lt;/ref&gt; It is also not evident whether she has ever pursued the university path; herself she claimed having studied Filosofía y Letras, though neither the timing nor location are known; according to her later account, she followed the classes of [[Miguel de Unamuno]] and [[Julián Besteiro]].&lt;ref&gt;she admits having listened to Besteiro and Unamuno, ''La Vanguardia'' 26.01.72&lt;/ref&gt; Vivacious, straightforward and vibrant,&lt;ref&gt;„me gustaban [...] llevar melena y falda corta", Andrés Prieto 2012, p. 41&lt;/ref&gt; Urraca commenced her professional career by teaching at La Obra del Ave-María,&lt;ref&gt;Moral Roncal 2011, p. 206, Moral Roncal 2013, p. 67&lt;/ref&gt; a network of Catholic schools founded by [[Andrés Manjón]] and focused on poverty-stricken children, at unspecified time in the 1920s acting as directora of the Bilbao branch.&lt;ref&gt;Andrés Prieto 2012, p. 42&lt;/ref&gt; She also became auxiliary teacher at Escuela Normal de Bilbao, at that time considered „universidad femenina".&lt;ref&gt;Moral Roncal 2011, p. 203, Moral Roncal 2013, p. 65&lt;/ref&gt; Urraca Pastor has never married and has had no children.

==Early public activity==

Urraca first spoke publicly in 1923 during Semana Pedagogica in Bilbao.&lt;ref&gt;''Urraca Pastor (María Rosa)'' entry, [in:] ''Enciclopedia Espasa'' p. 179&lt;/ref&gt; In the mid-1920s she entered [[Acción Católica de la Mujer]];&lt;ref&gt;Moral Roncal 2011, p. 204&lt;/ref&gt; her insatiable character and a knack for letters produced the 1925 appointment to manager of ''Boletín de la ACM de Vizcaya''.&lt;ref&gt;Moral Roncal 2011, p. 204, Moral Roncal 2013, p. 66&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars claim that by the end of the decade she became president of the entire Bilbao section of ACM.&lt;ref&gt;Brian D. Bunk, ''Ghosts of Passion: Martyrdom, Gender, and the Origins of the Spanish Civil War'', Durham 2007, {{ISBN|9780822339434}}, p 39, Miren Llona González, ''El feminismo católico en los años veinte y sus antecedentes ideológicos'', [in:] ''Vasconia'' 25 (1998),  p. 296&lt;/ref&gt; Urraca got enthusiastically involved in a number of social, charity and educational initiatives of the organization, at that time very much encouraged by the [[Miguel Primo de Rivera|Primo de Rivera]] dictatorship.&lt;ref&gt;Andrés Prieto 2012, p. 22, Moral Roncal 2011, p. 206&lt;/ref&gt; In the mid-1920s she became engaged in the nascent radio broadcasting; she was noted by the press as occasionally on air giving lectures on cultural subjects&lt;ref&gt;like lecture on „Cantos Asturianos" in 1925, ''El Sol'' 15.06.25, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0000309378&amp;page=4 here].&lt;/ref&gt; and commenced close co-operation with ''T.S.H.'', a weekly issued by [[Asociación Radio Española]]. She also admitted contributing to ''[[El Sol (Madrid)|El Sol]]'', a Madrid daily of Liberal leaning, though nature of this engagement is rather obscure.&lt;ref&gt;''La Vanguardia'' 26.01.72&lt;/ref&gt;

The young María Rosa became a role model for a new breed of Catholic female public activists,&lt;ref&gt;she was not first Carlist female propagandist. In the 1930s [[Dolores Gortázar Serantes]] was hailed as a veteran Carlist woman writer, yet her propaganda activity was formatted along 19th century lines. Urraca had no problem engaging in mixed-sex initiatives. Gortázar excelled in small, dedicated groupings, Urraca starred in broad-scale, general organizations. Gortázar focused on cultural and educational activities, Urraca engaged in open politics. Gortázar was brilliant in behind-the-scene, closed meetings, Urraca was an excellent speaker at mass rallies&lt;/ref&gt; opposed to the old-style Catholic wife and mother epitome and throwing themselves in social and education work. A number of senior nationwide ACM militants – including her idol, Carmen Cuesta&lt;ref&gt;whom she considered th best female speaker ever, ''La Vanguardia'' 26.01.72&lt;/ref&gt; - entered the primoderiverista quasi-parliament, [[:es:Asamblea Nacional Consultiva|Asamblea Nacional Consultiva]]; riding the wave of regime's modernizing attempts and its support for females activists, Urraca was appointed to the official labor administration.&lt;ref&gt;Andrés Prieto 2012, p. 42&lt;/ref&gt; In 1929 she was nominated Inspectora De Trabajo,&lt;ref&gt;''La Vanguardia'' 26.01.72, Andrés Prieto 2012, p. 42&lt;/ref&gt; which converted her standing from a Catholic social worker to a state official. She took part in schemes like Patronato De Previsión Social de Vizcaya and Patronato Nacional De Recuperación De Inválidos Para El Trabajo.&lt;ref&gt;''La Vanguardia'' 26.01.72, Andrés Prieto 2012, p. 43, Moral Roncal 2011, p. 207&lt;/ref&gt; She started to address social issues by publishing in the press, be it local Biscay titles like ''[[:es:El Nervión|El Nervión]]'', ''[[:es:La Gaceta del Norte|La Gaceta del Norte]]'' and ''El Pueblo Vasco''&lt;ref&gt;''La Vanguardia'' 26.01.72&lt;/ref&gt; or national ones like ''La Nación''.&lt;ref&gt;Andrés Prieto 2012, p. 43, Moral Roncal 2011, p. 202, Moral Roncal 2013, p. 65&lt;/ref&gt; Urraca also started to gain recognition beyond [[Biscay]]: professional duties brought her to other regions&lt;ref&gt;e.g. to Catalonia&lt;/ref&gt; and ACM assignment enabled her to take part in 1929 Congreso Femenino Hispanoamericano, staged by the organization in [[Seville]].&lt;ref&gt;Andrés Prieto 2012, p. 43, Moral Roncal 2011, p. 207, Moral Roncal 2013, p. 67&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 102-11543, Madrid, Ausrufung der Zweiten Spanischen Republik.jpg|thumbnail|[[Second Spanish Republic|Republic]] declared, 1931]]
Urraca considered the fall of the monarchy a national disaster.&lt;ref&gt;she cried having learnt the fall of the monarchy, Frances Lannon, ''The Spanish Civil War, 1936–1939'', London 2002, {{ISBN|9781841763699}}, p. 83, she cried, Andrés Prieto 2012, p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; Almost immediately she engaged in public rallies either in favor of the monarchy&lt;ref&gt;Andrés Prieto 2012, p. 48&lt;/ref&gt; or protesting against militantly secular policy of the Republic.&lt;ref&gt;Lannon 2002, p. 83&lt;/ref&gt; Already in May 1931 she was detained and fined 500 pesetas for promoting a meeting classified as non-constitutional conspiracy.&lt;ref&gt;Lannon 2002, p. 83, ''La Vanguardia'' 26.01.72, Andrés Prieto 2012, p. 55, Moral Roncal 2011, p. 208&lt;/ref&gt; She seemed politically disoriented; due to her earlier engagements she was considered sort of a socialist,&lt;ref&gt;''La Vanguardia'' 26.01.72, she gained local renown engaged in struggle to gain better conditions for female textile workers, Lannon 2002, p. 83&lt;/ref&gt; ACM record made her look towards Christian organizations, in the April 1931 elections Urraca worked as propagandist supporting [[Alfonsism|Alfonsine]] candidates&lt;ref&gt;Moral Roncal 2011, p. 208, Moral Roncal 2013, p. 67; the 1931 appearances in favor of Alfonsist candidates were her first public political addresses, ''Urraca Pastor (María Rosa)'' entry, [in:] ''Enciclopedia Espasa'' p. 180&lt;/ref&gt; and she neared [[José María Albiñana]] and his Legionarios.&lt;ref&gt;''La Vanguardia'' 26.01.72&lt;/ref&gt; In late 1931 she co-organized Agrupación de Defensa Femenina, a conservative female organization grouping Alfonsine monarchists, Carlists and the [[Basque people|Basque]] Emakumes,&lt;ref&gt;Moral Roncal 2011, p. 209, Moral Roncal 2013, p. 69&lt;/ref&gt; and was later asked to write the program draft.&lt;ref&gt;Moral Roncal 2011, p. 209&lt;/ref&gt; Extremely active, she helped to organize 50 meetings during four months.&lt;ref&gt;Moral Roncal 2011, pp. 209-10&lt;/ref&gt; In 1932 she was fired as labor inspector.&lt;ref&gt;Andrés Prieto 2012, pp. 43, 69&lt;/ref&gt;

==Carlist==
When detained, active in joint right-wing women groupings or collecting funds to pay fines, Urraca started to meet and forged closer relations with female Carlists;&lt;ref&gt;''La Vanguardia'' 26.01.72&lt;/ref&gt; she was particularly impressed by María Ortega de Pradera, local ACM leader and wife of the [[Traditionalism (Spain)|Traditionalist]] theorist [[Víctor Pradera Larumbe|Victor Pradera]].&lt;ref&gt;she was presidenta de Junta Diocesiana de ACM de San Sebastián, Moral Roncal 2011, p. 205-6, Moral Roncal 2013, p. 66&lt;/ref&gt; She later claimed having been fascinated by their unshaken Christianity, valiance and fortitude,&lt;ref&gt;Andrés Prieto 2012, p. 50&lt;/ref&gt; especially against the bewilderment of the Alfonsine monarchism.&lt;ref&gt;''La Vanguardia'' 26.01.72&lt;/ref&gt; During the winter of 1931-1932 she neared the Carlists, starting to appear on their public rallies and quickly becoming sort of a rising star of the Carlist propaganda; her earlier combined experience in ACM, broadcasting, schools and newspapers turned her into a thrilling orator.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Vallverdú i Martí, ''El Carlisme Català Durant La Segona República Espanyola 1931–1936'', Barcelona 2008, {{ISBN|9788478260805}}, pp. 96, 101, 129&lt;/ref&gt; Already in 1932 she was speaking at Carlist and Catholic meetings all over Spain,&lt;ref&gt;e.g. in like Andalusia, Moral Roncal 2011, p. 210&lt;/ref&gt; appearing among top Traditionalist politicians and most distinguished female activists.&lt;ref&gt;Andrés Prieto 2012, p. 69. Among the Carlist speakers she was among those who emphasized the social threads the most, Moral Roncal 2011, p. 214&lt;/ref&gt; Urraca contributed also to Carlist press,&lt;ref&gt;''El Pensamiento Navarro'', ''El Pensamiento Alavés'', ''La Unión de Sevilla'' and ''Boletín de Orientación Tradicionalista'', Andrés Prieto 2012, p. 68; she also formed editorial board of ''Ellas. Semanario de las mujeres españolas'' (1932-4), see [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/details.vm?q=id:0003716921&lt; here]&lt;/ref&gt; activity which triggered further fines.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. for writing that the Azaña government is morally responsible for the Casas Viejas incident, Martin Blinkhorn, ''Carlism and Crisis in Spain 1931–1939'', Cambridge 2008, {{ISBN|9780521207294}}, p. 99&lt;/ref&gt; In 1933 she was already sort of a Carlist celebrity, acclaimed by their political leaders.&lt;ref&gt;Moral Roncal 2011, p. 213-4&lt;/ref&gt; and called omnipresent.&lt;ref&gt;Vallverdú i Martí 2008, p. 251, Jordi Canal i Morell, ''El carlismo: dos siglos de contrarrevolución en España'', Madrid 2000, {{ISBN|8420639478}}, pp. 294-7&lt;/ref&gt; She was noted by political opponents: [[Indalecio Prieto]] ridiculed her in the press stating that "the cavemen got their miss",&lt;ref&gt;''La Vanguardia'' 26.01.72, Andrés Prieto 2012, p. 66, Moral Roncal 2011, p. 210, Moral Roncal 2013, p. 69; hostile press was also ridiculing her family name; urraca in Spanish means magpie, see ''Vida Nueva. Órgano de la UGT y del PSOE'' 07.07.33&lt;/ref&gt; to which the Carlist [[Requetés]] responded by greeting her with "Long Live Miss Cavemen" cry.&lt;ref&gt;''La Vanguardia'' 26.01.72, Moral Roncal 2011, p. 211, Moral Roncal 2013, p. 70&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Spanish general election, 1933|1933 elections]] she [[Electoral Carlism (Second Republic)|ran for the Cortes]] from [[Gipuzkoa]] as Carlist representative in Unión Regionalista Gipuzcoana;&lt;ref&gt;she did not want to run, but was persuaded to, initially on Candidatura Católico-Agraria de La Rioja, Moral Roncal 2013, p. 72&lt;/ref&gt; greeted by the Republican press as „candidatura de la Edad Media, típicamente troglodita",&lt;ref&gt;Andrés Prieto 2012, p. 70, Moral Roncal 2011, p. 215&lt;/ref&gt; she narrowly missed the election.&lt;ref&gt;Andrés Prieto 2012, p. 70, Moral Roncal 2011, p. 215; having gained 31618 votes she missed 1702, Moral Roncal 2013, p. 72&lt;/ref&gt; Embittered by backstage political haggling&lt;ref&gt;taking place and concluded that „la Comunión Tradicionalista me ha vendido por unas miserables pesetas Moral Roncal 2011, p. 216, Moral Roncal 2013, p. 72&lt;/ref&gt; Urraca was disillusioned by parliamentary politics;&lt;ref&gt;Andrés Prieto 2012, p. 71&lt;/ref&gt; she went on with hectic propaganda activity across Spain, gaining nationwide recognition as an inflammatory and thrilling orator and greeted by homages from the Right and abuse from the Left.&lt;ref&gt;Moral Roncal 2011, p. 216; during public gatherings she was whistled down by the Falangists, Blinkhorn 2008, p. 280&lt;/ref&gt; As Carlist leaders realized how important the female votes were&lt;ref&gt;Fal Conde claimed that the Right won the 1933 elections mostly thanks to female votes; hence, he appreciated the need to keep the feminine electorate militant on his side, Moral Roncal 2011, p. 218&lt;/ref&gt; she gained weight within the movement and entered correspondence with the Carlist queen, [[Infanta Maria das Neves of Portugal|María de las Nieves]].&lt;ref&gt;Moral Roncal 2011, p. 216-7&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:María Rosa Urraca.jpg|thumbnail|160px|Urraca speaking, 1934]]
Following organizational shakeup of the party executive in 1934, the new leader [[Manuel Fal Conde|Manuel Fal]] entrusted her with re-modeling the Secciones Femeninas of [[:es:Comunión Tradicionalista|Comunión Tradicionalista]].&lt;ref&gt;most refer to her as „key activist", see Andrés Prieto 2012, p. 71&lt;/ref&gt; Female groupings, known as Margaritas, operated as affiliated with local circulos; apart from boosting membership and launching new activities, Urraca was entrusted with turning the organization from very loose federation into a nationwide structure; since the task has never been fully completed she did not assume formal presidency,&lt;ref&gt;Moral Roncal 2013, p. 73-4&lt;/ref&gt; though some scholars name her de facto leader.&lt;ref&gt;Blinkhorn 2008, p. 212, She was not just a follower, but laid out her own ideas how to organize female structures, compare her ''Una idea y un proyecto. A las organizaciones femeninas tradicionalistas de España'', published in ''El Siglo Futuro'' 29.01.34&lt;/ref&gt; Up to 1936 Margaritas recruited 23,000 women,&lt;ref&gt;compared to 70,000 of Juventud Femenina de Acción Católica&lt;/ref&gt; mostly in [[Valencia province|Valencia]], [[Navarre]] and [[Names of the Basque Country (in Spanish)|Vascongadas]].&lt;ref&gt;Andrés Prieto 2012, p. 72.

In [[Spanish general election, 1936|1936]] she unsuccessfully run for the parliament again, this time from [[Teruel Province|Teruel]].&lt;ref&gt;despite a massive support campaign organised by various Carlist structures Moral Roncal 2011, p. 221-2&lt;/ref&gt; Urraca continued her favorite social activities setting up Socorro Blanco, the Carlist relief organization.&lt;ref&gt;it was set up to assist the members fined, imprisoned or otherwised penalised by the Republic, Andrés Prieto 2012, p. 71-2, Moral Roncal 2011, p. 219, Moral Roncal 2013, p. 74&lt;/ref&gt; In the movement's press she campaigned for Spiritual Crusade of Prayer.&lt;ref&gt;intended as a campaign of prayer and self-sacrifice Andrés Prieto 2012, p. 72, Moral Roncal 2011, p. 220, Moral Roncal 2013, p. 74&lt;/ref&gt; In April 1936 she was detained for illegal possession of a pistol&lt;ref&gt;when visiting a requete in a Madrid hospital she was searched and a hidden pistol was discovered, Andrés Prieto 2012, p. 87; slightly different version of the incident in Moral Roncal 2013, p. 64&lt;/ref&gt; but was smuggled out of custody and spent the last few months of peace hiding in a village of [[Arcos de la Llana]] near Burgos.&lt;ref&gt;Andrés Prieto 2012, p. 72, Moral Roncal 2013, p. 64&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Aranda de Duero]] Urraca joined the Navarrese troops commanded by [[:es:Francisco García-Escámez|García Escámez]] and heading for Madrid.&lt;ref&gt;incorporated into Servicios de Sanidad Moral Roncal 2013, p. 76, Pablo Larraz Andía, Víctor Sierra-Sesúmaga Ariznabarreta, ''Requetés: de las trincheras al olvido'', Madrid 2011, {{ISBN|8499700462}}, 9788499700465, p. 212, Julio Aróstegui, ''Combatientes Requetés en la Guerra Civil española, 1936–1939'', Madrid 2013, {{ISBN|9788499709758}}, p. 436&lt;/ref&gt; On the intermittent basis she served as nurse on the [[Sierra de Guadarrama|Guadarrama]] front;&lt;ref&gt;„Urraca had now experienced all the excitements of the battle – bomb explosions from aviation, shell bursts from artillery, and now flying bullets; the only thrill missing was a grenade attack, immediately rectified by a grenade burst a few metres above", Nicholas Coni, ''Medicine and Warfare: Spain, 1936–1939'', New York 2013, {{ISBN|9781134170692}}, p. 45&lt;/ref&gt; during breaks&lt;ref&gt;e.g. Lannon 2002, p. 83, Andrés Prieto 2012, p. 88; in October 1936 she moved to the Biscay section of the Northern front - Lannon 2002, p. 83, Andrés Prieto 2012, p. 88, Moral Roncal 2013, p. 79; her father was incarcerated by the Republicans and her mother was ill; she wrote to the Carlist king Alfonso Carlos so that he works with German and Austrian diplomatic services and get her father is released, Moral Roncal 2013, p. 79&lt;/ref&gt; she engaged in propaganda work&lt;ref&gt;e.g. radio broadcasts, Moral Roncal 2013, p. 77&lt;/ref&gt; and threw herself into organizing Carlist medical services, mostly recruiting women as nurses and auxiliary staff.

In immediate vicinity of the frontline Urraca made a picturesque figure; apart from typical medical activities she dispensed [[cognac]] at arbitrary doses to the wounded.&lt;ref&gt;Coni 2013, pp. 45-6&lt;/ref&gt; According to some testimonies, she inflicted her Christian compassion upon the otherwise fanatical Carlist soldiers and prevented Nationalists from executing the Republican prisoners;&lt;ref&gt;see the account of Ernesto Carratala, a communist and well-known professor of linguistics in Barcelona, who claims when upon having been captured as Republican POW in Sierra de Guadarrama, he got his wounds treated by Urraca herself; later she confronted the crowd of Falangists and Requetes and prevented his execution, ''La Vanguardia'' 10.09.99, available [http://hemeroteca.lavanguardia.com/preview/1999/09/10/pagina-28/34496361/pdf.html here]; see also the story of a Nationalist soldier „shouting abuse at prisoners.

The priest a number of his associates were indeed executed afterwards, J. M. Gamboa, J. C. Larronde (eds.), ''La guerra civil en Euzkadi. 136 testimonios inéditos recogidos por José Miguel de Barandiaran'', Milafranga 2006, {{ISBN|9788488464033}}&lt;/ref&gt; especially for executions of Basque priests.&lt;ref&gt;referred after Martorell Pérez 2009, pp. 98-99&lt;/ref&gt; She is also quoted writing that the orphaned Republican children should not be treated the same way as the Nationalist ones.&lt;ref&gt;though she claimed that children can not be held responsible for deeds of their fathers, she also maintained that Republican orphans require additional educational effort, which was not necessary in case of Nationalist orphans, full quotation in Andrés Prieto 2012, pp. 93-4, Moral Roncal 2013, p. 82, Gonzalez-Allende 2009, p. 94&lt;/ref&gt;

In late April called to [[Salamanca]] and received by [[Francisco Franco|Franco]],&lt;ref&gt;María Beatriz Delgado Bueno, ''La Sección Femenina en Salamanca y Valladolid durante la guerra civil. Alianzas y rivalidades'' [PhD thesis accepted at Universidad de Salamanca, Faculrad de Historia y Geografia], Salamanca 2009, pp. 81, 247&lt;/ref&gt; she entered Sección Femenina of the newly created [[Falange Española Tradicionalista y de las Juntas de Ofensiva Nacional Sindicalista|state party]] and along [[Pilar Primo de Rivera]] and [[:es:Mercedes Sanz-Bachiller|Mercedes Sanz Bachiller]] became one of its leaders. Urraca assumed management of Delegación Nacional de Frentes y Hospitales,&lt;ref&gt;Moral Roncal 2011, p. 222&lt;/ref&gt; one of three branches of the Sección&lt;ref&gt;Andrés Prieto 2012, p. 76&lt;/ref&gt; and entrusted with catering for the wounded. In FET she emerged as one of 3 Carlists among 14 heads of all Delegaciones. In October 1937 she was appointed - as one of 11 Carlists&lt;ref&gt;Canal 2000, p. 340; some sources claim that as one 12 Carlists, César Alcalá, ''D. Mauricio de Sivatte. Una biografía política (1901–1980)'', Barcelona 2001, {{ISBN|8493109797}}, p. 135; the difference stems from treatment of Fal Conde, who was appointed but did not accept&lt;/ref&gt; - to the newly established, 50-member [[National Council of the Movement|Consejo Nacional]],&lt;ref&gt;she was one of 3 females appointed, with number 8; Pilar Primo de Rivera came appointed with number 1 and Mercedes Sanz with number 10; Delgado Bueno 2009, p. 266&lt;/ref&gt; which triggered her expulsion from Comunión Tradicionalista.&lt;ref&gt;none of the sources consulted explicitly states that Urraca was expulsed, though some claim that all those who accepted seats in Consejo were, see Juan Carlos Peñas Bernaldo de Quirós, ''El Carlismo, la República y la Guerra Civil (1936–1937). De la conspiración a la unificación'', Madrid 1996, {{ISBN|9788487863523}}, p. 297&lt;/ref&gt; Engaged in organization and propaganda work, she kept visiting frontlines&lt;ref&gt;e.g. on the Teruel front during the winter of 1937-38, Larraz Andía, Sierra-Sesúmaga Ariznabarreta 2011, p. 335&lt;/ref&gt; and was fêted along Nationalist heroes like [[José Moscardó Ituarte|Moscardó]].&lt;ref&gt;Coni York 2013, p. 45&lt;/ref&gt; Paradoxically, in the Republican media Urraca enjoyed no lesser popularity than in the Nationalist ones, mocked and ridiculed by the enemy press.&lt;ref&gt;a Madrid ''La Libertad'' deplored Nationalists' forced mobilisation of proletarian women "when ladies and damsels of Urraca Pastor hide in their homes, where they pray for the fascist cause" - ''La Libertad'' 02.11.37, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0003205739&amp;page=1 here],; the anarchist ''Solidaridad Obrera'' informed about the Moroccans raping Republican nurses and asked "what would Urraca Pastor say about this?" - ''Solidaridad Obrera'' 05.12.37, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0004921789&amp;page=1 here], while the Barcelona ''La Vanguardia'' ridiculed the propaganda of "doña Urraca" during the battle of Teruel – ''La Vanguardia'' 04.01.38, available [http://hemeroteca.lavanguardia.com/preview/1938/01/04/pagina-3/33130565/pdf.html here]. For some reason her person attracted particular attention of the Republican propaganda, which overemphasized her role; she was even reported as a colonel, touring the frontlines by air accompanied by a personal adjutant, ''ABC'' (Madrid) 12.08.36, available [http://hemeroteca.abc.es/nav/Navigate.exe/hemeroteca/madrid/abc/1936/08/12/010.html here], or a newly appointed Nationalist minister of industry, ''ABC'' 01.08.36, referred after Moral Roncal 2013, p. 77. The ridiculing of Urraca persisted well into hostile historiography; a British scholar, Paul Preston, defines Delegación de Frentes y Hospitales as „a patrician welfare organization headed by the Carlist Maria Rosa Urraca Pastor", Paul Preston, ''Doves of War: Four Women of Spain'', Boston 2002, {{ISBN|9781555535605}}, p. 35&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Pilar Primo de Rivera.jpg|thumbnail|160px|[[Pilar Primo de Rivera]]]]
In Sección Femenina Urraca clashed with Pilar Primo de Rivera. Apart from the rivalry of strong female personalities, the conflict was fuelled by ideological differences between the [[Falange Española de las JONS|original Falange]] and the Comunión.&lt;ref&gt;during the Republic days Urraca was sometimes whistled down by the Falangists Blinkhorn 2008, p. 280&lt;/ref&gt; Urraca tried to ensure autonomy of the Delegación against the Falange-dominated Sección.&lt;ref&gt;Moral Roncal 2013, p. 84-5, Delgado Bueno 2009, p. 251&lt;/ref&gt; Uneasy relationship developed into open conflict already in 1937,&lt;ref&gt;Delgado Bueno 2009, p. 256&lt;/ref&gt; going from bad to worse and culminating in showdown related to personal appointments of provincial Delegación leaders, badges designed for the service and creation of Cuerpo de Enfermeras.&lt;ref&gt;Delgado Bueno 2009, p. 257-8&lt;/ref&gt; Primo de Rivera got the upper hand and Urraca resigned from leadership posts in Sección Femenina in July 1938,&lt;ref&gt;Andrés Prieto 2012, p. 82, 89, Delgado Bueno 2009, p. 261; she was replaced by Casilda Ampuero&lt;/ref&gt; which in some areas led to massive departures of the Margaritas&lt;ref&gt;like Rioja, Mercedes Peñalba Sotorrío, ''Entre la boina roja y la camisa azul, Estella'' 2013, {{ISBN|9788423533657}}, pp, 65, 135&lt;/ref&gt; and the ultimate failure of amalgamating Margaritas into FET.&lt;ref&gt;Delgado Bueno 2009, p. 291&lt;/ref&gt; Though in 1939 she was confirmed as member of the II. Consejo&lt;ref&gt;''La Vanguardia'' 06.06.39, available [http://hemeroteca.lavanguardia.com/preview/1939/02/18/pagina-1/33116357/pdf.html here]&lt;/ref&gt; and awarded Cruz Roja del Mérito Militar,&lt;ref&gt;''Boletin Oficial del Estado'' 01.06.39, p. 2996, available [http://bibliotecavirtualdefensa.es/BVMDefensa/i18n/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?path=16931 here]&lt;/ref&gt; Urraca was not appointed to the III. Consejo in 1942 and dropped out of the FET executive,&lt;ref&gt;Moral Roncal 2013, p. 87&lt;/ref&gt; soon retiring to privacy and settling temporarily with her parents in [[Zaragoza]].

When the civil war ended Urraca was only 39; her hectic activity of the past, abundant with a variety of initiatives and well portrayed in historiography, was to remain in sharp contrast with the next 45 years of her life, spent in privacy and ignored by historians: there is almost no scholarly information on her during that period. Her fate is compared to getting lost in "horror vacui",&lt;ref&gt;Andrés Prieto 2012, p. 102&lt;/ref&gt; or disappearance in "tierra di nadie".&lt;ref&gt;Andrés Prieto 2012, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;

When in Zaragoza Urraca befriended María Pilar Ros Martínez;&lt;ref&gt;widow of the late Carlist Aragon leader [[Jesús Comín Sagüés]]&lt;/ref&gt; she was [[Catalan People|Catalan]] herself and persuaded Urraca to move together to [[Barcelona]].&lt;ref&gt;''La Vanguardia'' 22.03.84, available [http://hemeroteca.lavanguardia.com/preview/1984/03/22/pagina-67/32838129/pdf.html here]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1939 or 1940 Urraca settled with her parents in the Catalan capital.&lt;ref&gt;it might have counted that García Escámez, her old-time commander from the 1936 campaign in Sierra de Guadarrama, was appointed military governor of the province, Moral Roncal 2013, p. 87. In the 1950s she lived at Calle Consejo del Ciento 359, ''La Vanguardia'' 03.03.60, available [http://hemeroteca.lavanguardia.com/preview/1960/03/03/pagina-21/32723188/pdf.html here]&lt;/ref&gt; In the new setting she turned her home into a cultural circle. In the 1940s Urraca staged regular reunions at home; they were intended as artistic events, often with prestigious guests invited and covering music, painting and theatre.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. honoring musicians (Sorrosal, José Clará y Eduardo Marquina) singers (Gianna Pederzini) or painterns (Fernando Álvarez de Sotomayor, Marcelino Santa María), playing theatrical pieces etc., Moral Roncal 2013, p. 87&lt;/ref&gt; She did not resume teaching; in 1940 Urraca started to deliver public lectures.&lt;ref&gt;''La Vanguardia'' 07.08.40, available [http://hemeroteca.lavanguardia.com/preview/1939/02/18/pagina-3/33117445/pdf.html here]&lt;/ref&gt; Advertised in the press as „charlas-recitales", they were usually focusing on arts, though some discussed history and were intended as homage to patriotic virtues. Applauded in the newspapers as „ilustra charlista", she continued on commercial basis until the late 1940s,&lt;ref&gt;the last one identified in appeared in 1947, see ''La Vanguardia'' 19.11.47, available [http://hemeroteca.lavanguardia.com/preview/1947/09/25/pagina-9/33101149/pdf.html here]&lt;/ref&gt; appearing also in Alava&lt;ref&gt;''Pensamiento alaves' '09.10.40, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?interno=S&amp;posicion=2&amp;path=1000032573&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt; or Leon.&lt;ref&gt;''Diario de Zamora'' 19.03.44, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?interno=S&amp;posicion=5&amp;path=1000119270&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt; The event, typically formatted as a semi-scholarly lecture, in her case was a theatrical monodrama, a genre of stage performance and actually delivered in places like [[:caTeatre Circ Olympia|Teatro Olympia]].&lt;ref&gt;''La Vanguardia'' 05.03.41, available [http://hemeroteca.lavanguardia.com/preview/1941/03/05/pagina-4/33112196/pdf.html here]; she also took part in other cultural events, see ''Ritmo'' 01.04.43, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?interno=S&amp;posicion=10&amp;path=1000203421&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:GBN.19.19.11.jpg|thumbnail|160px|Barcelona, mid-1950s]]
In 1940 Urraca published wartime memoirs, titled ''Así empezamos'';&lt;ref&gt;Andrés Prieto 2012, p. 89, detailed discussion in Gonzalez-Allende&lt;/ref&gt; the work contained repeated homage references to Franco, though was principally designed as praise of males and especially females who contributed to the Nationalist war effort.&lt;ref&gt;Andrés Prieto 2012, p. 89-90&lt;/ref&gt; The work tended to stay clear of assailing the Republican opponents;&lt;ref&gt;e.g. it emphasized resspect for the enemy wounded, Gonzalez-Allende 2009, p. 93&lt;/ref&gt; it highlighted serenity of serving the cause of God and Spain.&lt;ref&gt;Gonzalez-Allende 2009, p. 88&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars point to alleged incompatibility between ever-encompassing maternophilia&lt;ref&gt;Gonzalez-Allende 2009, p. 90&lt;/ref&gt; and repeated masculine identifications, both neighboring in the book.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. when stressting that she was a Carlist rather than a Margarita and when she mixed with soldiers, Gonzalez-Allende 2009, p. 103&lt;/ref&gt; In Barcelona Urraca set up her own publishing house named MRUPSA,&lt;ref&gt;"María Rosa Urraca Pastor Sociedad Anónima", Andrés Prieto 2012, p. 91&lt;/ref&gt; which in the 1940s co-issued two biographical books she had written and edited herself: one dedicated to [[Francis Borgia, 4th Duke of Gandía|Francis Borgia]] and another one to [[Lola Montez|Lola Montes]];&lt;ref&gt;Andrés Prieto 2012, p. 91&lt;/ref&gt; she also published few books of other authors.&lt;ref&gt;Fernand J. Sautés, ''Autopsia, cara y cruz del drama francés 1939–1944'' (1946), Emilia Pardo Bazán, ''Los pazos de Ulloa'' (1944) and Armie [?], ''Maria Cristina de Habsburgo – reina de España'' (1945). The last one is intriguing not only because of anonymous and unidentified author. The book highlighted the person of the Alfonsist queen, while Urraca was earlier on good personal terms with the Carlist queen&lt;/ref&gt; The enterprise ceased to operate in the late 1940s. Later on Urraca kept working on another book, dedicated to [[Mariology]],&lt;ref&gt;''La Vanguardia'' 26.01.72, Moral Roncal 2011, p. 222&lt;/ref&gt; but this one has never appeared in print.

As the family finances were sustained systematically only by military pension of her father, in mid-1950s Urraca started to give lessons in oratory skills.&lt;ref&gt;Moral Roncal 2013, p. 88, the first one identified appeared in 1957, see ''La Vanguardia'' 13.10.57, available [http://hemeroteca.lavanguardia.com/preview/1951/12/07/pagina-36/32769752/pdf.html here]&lt;/ref&gt; Though initially she advertised also teaching castellano,&lt;ref&gt;''La Vanguardia'' 06.03.58, available [http://hemeroteca.lavanguardia.com/preview/1958/02/08/pagina-28/32746764/pdf.html here]&lt;/ref&gt; later she dropped this feature from her press ads, which were appearing regularly in the local newspapers until the late 1960s; the last identified was published when she was 70 years old.&lt;ref&gt;''La Vanguardia'' 07.10.70, available [http://hemeroteca.lavanguardia.com/preview/1969/11/02/pagina-6/34309557/pdf.html here]&lt;/ref&gt; Since the death of her father in 1965, having no close family Urraca was increasingly alienated, also by the changing lifestyle patterns of the Spanish society. She maintained particularly close relationship only with María Pilar Comín Ros, almost 20 years her junior and the Barcelona press pundit on women's fashion.

==Late public activity==
[[File:Flag of Cross of Burgundy.svg|thumbnail|left|Carlist standard]]
Upon termination of Urraca's term in the II. Consejo Nacional of Falange in 1942 she has almost entirely disappeared from politics, be it either this related to official Falangist structures, unofficial Carlist movement or semi-political Catholic organizations. In scholarly works on political life during Francoism she is almost absent, very few times appearing marginally in works dealing with post-war Carlism.&lt;ref&gt;Francisco Javier Caspistegui Gorasurreta, ''El naufragio de las ortodoxias. El carlismo, 1962–1977'', Pamplona 1997; {{ISBN|9788431315641}}, pp. 138, 271, Robert Vallverdú i Martí, ''La metamorfosi del carlisme català: del "Déu, Pàtria i Rei" a l'Assamblea de Catalunya (1936-1975)'', Barcelona 2014, {{ISBN|9788498837261}}, p. 92&lt;/ref&gt; Her public activity – apart from organizing reunions, delivering charlas and editorial work, all intended mostly to sustain ailing family finances – was mostly about engagement in local parochial and municipal Christian initiatives. She is noted as busy in apostolate of the lay,&lt;ref&gt;Moral Roncal 2011, p. 222&lt;/ref&gt; sort of going on with her earlier teaching work when running cursillos organized by España Cristiana,&lt;ref&gt;Moral Roncal 2013, p. 87&lt;/ref&gt; and maintaining interest in social issues by animating Catholic charity.&lt;ref&gt;''CNT'' 27.01.57, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?interno=S&amp;posicion=3&amp;path=3088601&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1940s Urraca was still noted as taking part in broad public Carlist initiatives. In 1942 she was among the distinguished guests present at the Montcada i Reixac cemetery, attending memorial service to the fallen requetés and led by the Catalan Carlist leader [[Maurici de Sivatte i de Bobadilla|Maurici de Sivatte]] by the Mausoleum, erected 2 years earlier.&lt;ref&gt;Vallverdú i Martí 2014, p. 92&lt;/ref&gt; None of the sources consulted refers to her engagement in Carlist political structures; some authors claim that the Carlists have never forgiven her the 1937-1942 engagement in Falange.&lt;ref&gt;Andrés Prieto 2012, p. 93&lt;/ref&gt; It is not clear what stand – if any – she took when faced with fragmentation of Carlism, especially the [[Carloctavismo|Carloctavista]] breakup in the 1940s and the Sivattista secession in the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. she is only once and very casually mentioned in Vallverdú i Martí 2014, not having been listed at all in César Alcalá, ''D. Mauricio de Sivatte. Una biografía política (1901–1980)'', Barcelona 2001, {{ISBN|8493109797}}, the book which deals extensively with Catalan Carlism of the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s&lt;/ref&gt; The official propaganda ignored her; her old-time rival, Pilar Primo de Rivera, made sure Urraca does not grow to prominence and the feminine model she advanced was not in line with masculine domination in public life, advanced by Francoism.&lt;ref&gt;Gonzalez-Allende 2009, p. 99&lt;/ref&gt; She is noted, however, as taking part in various commemorative events organized by Catholic or social organizations.&lt;ref&gt;Moral Roncal 2013, p. 88&lt;/ref&gt; She also remained in touch with some personalities from both the Carlist and Republican camp.&lt;ref&gt;some time during Francoism visited by Ernesto Carratalá in Barcelona, the Republican POW spared execution due to Urraca's intervention; he brought her flowers; Moral Roncal 2013, p. 78, Martorell Pérez 2009, p. 86&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Street photographer in Barcelona.jpg|thumbnail|180px|Barcelona, mid-1970s]]
Urraca increased her public profile by the end of her life, re-engaging in Carlism. As at that time the movement was torn between the Traditionalists and the socialists from [[Partido Carlista]], she sided with the former; in 1972 she co-signed a document issued by Junta Nacional del Requeté, which lambasted [[Carlos Hugo]] as the one abandoned the Carlist standard.&lt;ref&gt;Caspistegui Gorasurreta 1997, p. 138&lt;/ref&gt; Urraca remained engaged in anti-hugocarlista backlash also later on, her last voice on the issue was heard in 1974.&lt;ref&gt;Caspistegui Gorasurreta 1997, p. 271&lt;/ref&gt; Also during transición she took part in cultural events related to orthodox Carlism.&lt;ref&gt;she provided a foreword opening a promotional meeting of a book ''El carlismo en el ser de España'' by Felio Villarublas, see ''La Vanguardia'' 15.03.77, available [http://hemeroteca.lavanguardia.com/preview/1977/03/15/pagina-44/33631874/pdf.html here]&lt;/ref&gt; In return, she was berated by the Partido Carlista propagandists as traitor and "enfermera de Franco".&lt;ref&gt;see the abusive title and contents of a sub-chapter ''María Rosa Urraca Pastor, la enfermera de Franco'', contained in section named ''Gallery of traitors'', replicated in a number of books by Josep Carles Clemente and published until today, e.g. José Carlos Clemente, ''Breve historia de las guerras carlistas'', Madrid 2011, {{ISBN|9788499671697}}, p. 235&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1970s she is known to have neared the post-Francoist [[búnker]]; in 1976 she lent her support to [[Blas Piñar]] and his [[Fuerza Nueva]];&lt;ref&gt;''Fuerza Nueva'' 22.05.76, available [http://ddd.uab.cat/pub/ppc/fuenue/fuenue_a1976m5d22n489.pdf here]&lt;/ref&gt; in 1977, shortly before official dissolution of Movimiento Nacional, she still used to frequent its Barcelona premises, recorded as affable, restrained, but energetic and committed to her ideals.&lt;ref&gt;Juan Fernández Krohn, ''Sindrome (joseantoniano) de Alicante'', [in:] ''Juan Fernández Krohn desde Bélgica'' blog, 16.09.2013, available [http://juanfernandezkrohn.blogspot.com/2013/09/sindrome-joseantoniano-de-alicante.html here]&lt;/ref&gt; Until her death she considered herself a Carlist. In a letter sent to ''[[La Vanguardia]]'' in 1982, Urraca proudly confirmed her lifetime identity.&lt;ref&gt;''La Vanguardia'' 05.11.82; and remained also a fundamentalist Catholic adhering to the Lefebvre format, Krohn 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception and legacy==
[[File:The Goblins' Christmas, 28.JPG|thumbnail|140px|left|[[:es:Miguel Bernet Toledano|some]] compared Urraca to a [[witch]]]]
In the 1930s hailed by the Right as electrifying orator and ridiculed by the Left as political troglodyte, after the Civil War Urraca has almost fallen into oblivion, save for three of her scarcely popular books. In the tightly censored media of the late 1940s an ex-Republican soldier turned graphics artist, [[:es:Jorge (historietista)|Miguel Bernet Toledano]], was permitted to create and publicize her malicious alter-ego known as [[:es:Doña Urraca (historieta)|Doña Urraca]], a comics figure to become iconic character in the Spanish print. A direct reference has never been made;&lt;ref&gt;there were also some visual differences between a character and its model: Doña Urraca was skinny-thin - Urraca Pastor was well-built, Doña Urraca wore glasses – Urraca Pastor did not, Doña Urraca wore black – Urraca Pastor preferred lighter colours&lt;/ref&gt; some claim the cartoon figure had nothing to do with Urraca Pastor,&lt;ref&gt;Krohn 2013; detailed discussion at ''La bruja y los paisanos: Doña Urraca de Jorge y varios señores normales'', [in:] ''De Todo Un Poco'' blog 14.05.2011, available [http://unamiajilladeto.blogspot.com/2011/05/la-bruja-y-los-paisanos-dona-urraca-de.html here]&lt;/ref&gt; some maintain that there is little doubt the ugly black-dressed witch, keen to abuse the weak with a sole purpose to do evil&lt;ref&gt;Krohn 2013&lt;/ref&gt; was aimed to mock her.&lt;ref&gt;Andrés Prieto 2012, p. 94&lt;/ref&gt; During transición she took the brunt of long-suppressed Republican anger; a wartime Francoist agent in France, an unrelated Pedro Urraca Rendueles,&lt;ref&gt;Iñaki Mirena Anasagasti Olabeaga, ''Urraca, el policía franquista que lideró agentes y espías en el exterior'', [in:] ''ianasagasti'' blog, available [http://ianasagasti.blogs.com/mi_blog/2013/07/urraca-el-polic%C3%ADa-franquista-que-lider%C3%B3-agentes-y-esp%C3%ADas-en-el-exterior.html here]&lt;/ref&gt; was presented as „Urraca Pastor"&lt;ref&gt;''Ressó'' June 1979, p. 14, available [http://xacpremsa.cultura.gencat.cat/pandora/cgi-bin/Pandora.exe here], this either confusion or intended manipulation persisted well into the 1990s, see ''El Pais'' 23.07.96, available [http://elpais.com/diario/1996/07/23/ultima/838072801_850215.html here]&lt;/ref&gt; and there was even a 1979 theatric play featuring him as a villain involved in execution of [[Companys]].&lt;ref&gt;''Plaça Gran'' 01.12.79, available [http://xacpremsa.cultura.gencat.cat/pandora/cgi-bin/Pandora.exe here]&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly before death she was mocked as a mustached nurse by the Noble-prize winner [[Camilo José Cela|José Cela]] in his ''Mazurca para dos muertos'' (1983); in literature she also appears - as bulky and ugly conspirator - in ''Inquietud en el Paraíso'' (2005) by [[Óscar Esquivias]].

In historiography she is approached as a representative of various social phenomena rather than as a personality herself. One author considers Urraca a typical sample of middle-class women politicized by rocky times of the Second Republic.&lt;ref&gt;Lannon 2002, p. 83&lt;/ref&gt; Another scholar advances a competitive thesis, namely that she engaged in public life mostly as a result of modernizing primoderiverista attempts combined with rising social activity of the Catholics.&lt;ref&gt;Andrés Prieto 2012, p. 68, Moral Roncal 2011, p. 223&lt;/ref&gt; Some point to social issues as a key thread of her activity,&lt;ref&gt;compare Moral Roncal 2011&lt;/ref&gt; some point to her traditional Catholicism&lt;ref&gt;compare Gonzalez-Allende 2009&lt;/ref&gt; and some focus on [[feminism]].&lt;ref&gt;compare Andrés Prieto 2012&lt;/ref&gt; This approach is particularly popular, as Urraca is often mentioned when discussing growing role of women in the recent history of Spain.&lt;ref&gt;see e.g. Isabel Morant Deusa, [[María Ángeles Querol]], ''Historia De Las Mujeres En Espana Y America Latina: Del Siglo XX a Los Umbrales Del Xxi'', Madrid 2005, {{ISBN|9788437622903}}, p. 158; ''Las mujeres y la Guerra Civil española'', Madrid 1991, {{ISBN|9788477990475}}, pp. 18, 189, 296; Mari Luz Esteban, Mila Amurrio, ''Feminist Challenges in the Social Sciences: Gender Studies in the Basque Country'', Reno 2010, {{ISBN|9781935709015}}, pp. 92-93, Llona González 1998&lt;/ref&gt; Though in the Basque realm she is held responsible for executions of priests,&lt;ref&gt;''Un libro recoge 136 testimonios inéditos de la Guerra del 36 recogidos por Barandiaran'', [in:] ''Gara'' 25.05.06, available [http://gara.naiz.eus/idatzia/20060525/art165831.php here], ''[[Diario Vasco]]'' 22.10.06, available [http://www.diariovasco.com/prensa/20061022/altodeba/urraca-pastor-amenazo-parroco_20061022.html here]&lt;/ref&gt; by many other scholars Urraca is viewed with cautious sympathy, as a person who was allegedly passionate about equality of the sexes,&lt;ref&gt;Lannon 2002, p. 83, though she also „estaba convencida de que la mujer podía servir al país fuera de casa", ''La Vanguardia'' 26.01.72&lt;/ref&gt; social justice,&lt;ref&gt;„tuve siempre un carácter independiente un instinto de rebeldía contra todo lo injusto. Juzgaba como tal el régimen económico en que vivía la sociedad y me atraía con irresistible vocación la defensa del humilde, del expoliado, del que sufría el despotismo brutal de un sistema positivista que todo lo materializaba, permitiendo la existencia de castas y de clases sociales en lucha permanente" – opinion of Andrés Prieto 2012, p. 49&lt;/ref&gt; classless society and post-war reconciliation,&lt;ref&gt;Lannon 2002, p. 83&lt;/ref&gt; a victim rather than a culprit.&lt;ref&gt;„High ideas for a better society co-existed with dedication to political movements that were ruthless and vengeful" – opinion of Lannon 2002, p. 83&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Leonid Meteor.jpg|thumbnail|170px|[[María Dolores Andrés Prieto (Spanish nurse and historian)|some]] compared Urraca to ''[[Meteoroid|estrella fugaz]]'']]
Except one early re-edition of ''Asi empezamos''&lt;ref&gt;re-published at unspecified time in Barcelona, most likely in the 1940s, see [http://www.todocoleccion.net/militaria-libros-literatura/guerra-civil-asi-empezamos-memorias-una-enfermera-maria-rosa-urraca-pastor-carlista-raro~x48490432 here]&lt;/ref&gt; none of Urraca's books has been re-printed. In Carlist historiography she either tends to be ignored by Traditionalist writers&lt;ref&gt;she is not mentioned in a section discussing Margaritas and Socorro Blanco by a classic Traditionalist historian in [[Melchor Ferrer Dalmau|Melchor Ferrer]], ''Breve historia del legitimismo español'', Madrid 1958, pp. 135-6; similarly, she is not a single time mentioned in another classic Carlist work, Roman Oyarzun, ''Historia del carlismo'', Madrid 1969; however, she is a number of times listed in detailed work of Melchor Ferrer, ''Historia del tradicionalismo español'', vol. XXX, Seville 1979&lt;/ref&gt; or to be abused by Partido Carlista militants.&lt;ref&gt;Andrés Prieto 2012, p. 93&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from a handful of related scholarly articles, she has earned one monograph so far, a master thesis in gender studies accepted at [[Universidad de Salamanca]] in 2012. In a remote tiny Andalusian village of La Dehesa there is a street commemorating Urraca Pastor.&lt;ref&gt;Andrés Prieto 2012, p. 92&lt;/ref&gt; An internet myth has it – information not confirmed by any scholarly work – that Urraca was responsible for Roman Catholic re-conversion of [[Dolores Ibarruri]] few years before death.&lt;ref&gt;compare comments below ''La Pasionaria, temida líder comunista, se confesó y comulgó antes de morir... católica'', [in:] ''Religión en Libertad'' 11.04.13, available [http://www.religionenlibertad.com/la-pasionaria-temida-lider-comunista-se-confeso-y-comulgo-antes-de-28650.htm here]; Urraca knew Ibarruri from the early Bilbao days and both remained on correct personal terms; their relationship, after the war somewhat cordial, was maintained at a distance even in the early 1970s, when Ibarruri was in Moscow, ''La Vanguardia'' 26.01.72&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The ministry oversees the [[Uganda People's Defence Forces]] (UPDF).

==Organisational structure==
Administratively, the ministry is oranised into three departments: the Department of Administration, Department of Finance, and Department of Logistics. The Permanent Secretary is the Chief Executive and Chief Accounting Officer for the entire ministry.&lt;ref name="Prof"/&gt; 

==Leadership==
The ministry is headed by a [[Cabinet of Uganda|cabinet minister]].

==Uganda People's Defence Force==
{{main|Uganda People's Defence Force}}

During the colonial days, the national defence forces were named King's African Rifles (KAR). Later the name changed to Uganda Rifles (UR) and then Uganda Army (UA). The force that fought the [[Uganda Bush War]], from 8 February 1981 to 26 January 1986, was called the National Liberation Army. In 1995, when a new constitution was promulgated, the name was changed to Uganda People's Defence Force.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://portal.defence.go.ug:10039/wps/portal/mod-home/armed-forces/updf-links/!ut/p/a1/xVVNc6JAEP0rm4PHOA2IDHubMu5W_Fw1biKX1IgwDsKAMAj46zNaW5WoiSa11i63prtfvX5vpgc56Ak5gm44o5LHgoa72Gk-20PAWhf0DvwiLSCtXgemxsDAk4YqmKkC-OAjcNg_fLAIkJ-_rdGwZ9_fd030iBzkuEImcolmSZxKGn7LuPRqsP0YlsI-bccKdgV6EEuLAmUbax2HNucr8yhtxxZQDOZ6bXgAdvMwDQl1gbphALkhDJw1dpQSyryFl3Em9pHLF2jGyqwqInZbRfnc55yV6cIvlu42iAXj-aIUdOX9EeTMxIeC2EMLiKI2GhntHbWT_pOCC4bsBb1gySVTOpcKFEki5gZmyEk930u9tJ6n6rQspUy-15Q7RVHUFyojXK_O4nrOavBe0zLOJHo6KUYzJYL1hgAmd0D0Fh5P7nSAfhNNTl1JZBSxsKryMihK4VaZH1EebrdFXC5PAPumDsQcaOQHHmug6X8NeMiwbV0ZUGtem-G1AadXB_y6hp1PXC4erNcOUTsnFtIr1en7V0vneNzjq_vuuGdXzXlArXFdwGEbvgzY-cTz8d8MufQKJNE0woHf7TXHuDLCTRQ9Dwa3dI7BMJPN9sFXP_ryNXokNzcvA2eQZQ!!/dl5/d5/L2dBISEvZ0FBIS9nQSEh/ | title=About UPDF | accessdate=20 October 2016 |

The '''Ministry of Defense of the Republic of Kazakhstan''' ([[Kazakh language|Kazakh]]:Қазақстан Республикасының Қорғаныс министрлігі) is a government agency of Kazakhstan which is the main executive body in implementing military policy. The '''Defense Minister of the Republic of Kazakhstan''' is the head of the Ministry of Defense, whose duties are to exercise the administrative leadership of the [[Armed Forces of the Republic of Kazakhstan]]. The ministry was established in May 1992 and is currently headed by Nurlan Ermekbaev. The first Minister of Defense was Army General Sagadat Nurmagambetov who served from May 1992 to October 16, 1995.

{{See also|Chief of the General Staff (Kazakhstan)}}
The '''General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Republic of Kazakhstan''' is the main body for the management of the armed forces of the state in peacetime and wartime, coordinates the development of plans for the construction and development of the Armed Forces, other troops and military formations, their operational, combat and mobilization training, organizes and carries out strategic planning application and interaction of the Armed Forces, other troops and military formations, and also develops a plan for the operational equipment of the country's territory in defense.

== Cadets Corps ==
The '''Cadet Corps of the Ministry of Defense of Kazakhstan named after [[Shoqan Walikhanov]]''' (Russian: Кадетский корпус Министерства обороны Республики Казахстан имени Чокана Валиханова) is a insitution of the ministry that was formed on 1 July 1996 as a secondary school that prepared Kazakh youth for service in the military and for leadership as junior army, navy, and air force commanders. A similar task is done today by the [[Astana Zhas Ulan Republican School]]. A month after its formation, the corps had 96 enlisted cadets, most of whom came from the [[Alma-Ata Higher All-Arms Command School]] (now the Military Institute of the Kazakh Ground Forces). On its first graduation day on July 29, 1999, where 11 cadets graduated from the corps and enrolled in higher educational institutions, the corps received its own battle flag by the then head of the corps, Colonel Kuangaliev and defense minister [[Mukhtar Altynbayev]]. The corps is currently based in the city of [[Shchuchinsk]] in the [[Akmola Region]].&lt;ref&gt;https://e-history.kz/en/publications/view/3087&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.mod.gov.kz/rus/obrazovanie/srednee_obrazovanie/uch_zavedeniya/?cid=0&amp;rid=383&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16669">{{Cannabis sidebar |Law}}'''Minors and the legality of cannabis''' is a topic around the world because there are many concerns about cannabis affecting adolescents and minors in negative ways. One example of why people find cannabis use among adolescents bad is because they are at a far greater risk of becoming dependent on cannabis.&lt;ref name="Impact of Marijuana on Children and Adolescents"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Impact of Marijuana on Children and Adolescents|journal=California Society of Addiction Medicine|date=September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is one of many reasons of why many different countries regulate cannabis differently, but still maintain a strict regulation on cannabis use among minors. The interaction that minors tend to have with cannabis is dependent on their location. Their location can also shape their perspective on cannabis, which can influence their usage of cannabis.

Cannabis has many purposes, including medicinal, but the general public has started showing an interest in the legalization and decriminalization of cannabis within different countries such as the [[Cannabis in the United States|United States]], [[Cannabis in Uruguay|Uruguay]], and the [[Drug policy of the Netherlands|Netherlands]]. 

In the United States, where cannabis is not legal on the federal level, states still have the opportunity to legalize cannabis for recreational or medical use if they want. As of  2018, there are 26 states and [[Washington, D.C.]] that have legalized some kind of medical cannabis law and eight states that have legalized cannabis for recreational use for individuals that are at least 21 years old. In 2014, all aspects of cannabis were legalized in the country of Uruguay, which means the sale, production, and consumption is legal for those that are at least 15 years old.&lt;ref name="Continued Opposition to Uruguay Marijuana Law and Challenge for Government" /&gt; While this was passed in Uruguay in an attempt to reduce crime and the drug cartel, many individuals strongly oppose the legalization of cannabis. In the Netherlands, all drugs are technically illegal, but the government created a policy that tends to tolerate cannabis under strict conditions. Individuals that are 18 years old and older can smoke cannabis within a certain space known as a “[[Cannabis coffee shop|coffeeshop]]".

==Health and cannabis among minors==

Countries tend to regulate cannabis differently depending on the way in which they view cannabis and its potential effects on individuals, including minors. One reason that individuals are concerned about the use among minors is because of the higher chance of dependency that studies have shown. Epidemiologists have found that 9% of people who begin smoking marijuana at 19 years or older satisfy the criteria of dependency and this number triples at ages under 18 years old.&lt;ref name="Impact of Marijuana on Children and Adolescents" /&gt; The reason for this is that a minor's brain is under rapid development when they are young. Studies have also shown that anxiety and depressive disorders have been the product of cannabis use and exposure among minors.&lt;ref name="Impact of Marijuana on Children and Adolescents" /&gt;

Medical cannabis is used for children with severe illnesses such as cancer and epilepsy. The use of cannabis relieves the pain and is seen as a “healthier” alternative because it is less addictive than drugs such as morphine and Oxycontin.&lt;ref name="Is Medical Marijuana Safe for Children?"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Szalavitz|first1=Maia|title=Is Medical Marijuana Safe for Children?|url=http://healthland.time.com/2012/11/28/is-medical-marijuana-safe-for-children/|website=TIME}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other pain-relieving medicines that are opioids tend to cause nausea and vomiting, while cannabis reduces these side effects. Because of this, many advocates argue that if opioids are acceptable to treat a minor’s pain, then cannabis should be as well.&lt;ref name="Is Medical Marijuana Safe for Children?" /&gt; As cannabis consumption among minors has increased, the rate at which they consume alcohol and smoke cigarettes has decreased dramatically.&lt;ref name="Why teem pot smoking could be a good thing"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gwynne|first1=Kristen|title=Why Teen Pot Smoking Could be a Good Thing|url=http://www.alternet.org/story/153498/study%3A_why_teen_pot_smoking_could_be_a_good_thing_(and_what_we_can_learn_from_teens_who_choose_weed_over_beer)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In the United States==
In the United States, marijuana is illegal under the federal [[Controlled Substances Act]], but most states have legalized some form of [[medical marijuana]], and a smaller but growing number of states have legalized marijuana for recreational use by adults.&lt;ref name="the marijuana legalization movement in the states"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gurciullo|first1=Brianna|last2=Mawdsley|first2=Karen|last3=Campbell|first3=Katie|title=The marijuana legalization movement begins in the states|url=http://www.publicintegrity.org/2015/08/16/17827/marijuana-legalization-movement-begins-states|publisher=The Center for Public Integrity}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cole"&gt;Tyler Cole, Sarah Trumble &amp; Lanae Erickson Hatalsky, [http://www.thirdway.org/report/all-state-marijuana-laws-are-not-created-equal All State Marijuana Laws Are Not Created Equal], Third Way (February 17, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt; However, "it is currently illegal in all 50 states for minors to use marijuana recreationally."&lt;ref name="Cole"/&gt; In some states (such as [[Illinois]], [[Pennsylvania]], and [[Connecticut]]) minors may use certain forms of marijuana for medical use if certain specific conditions are met.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lehighvalleylive.com/news/index.ssf/2016/07/how_to_get_medical_marijuana_f.html How to get medical marijuana for minor patients in Pennsylvania], ''[[The Express-Times]]'' (July 6, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robert McCoppin, [http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/breaking/ct-medical-marijuana-kids-met-20141223-story.html Children will get access to medical marijuana in Illinois], ''Chicago Tribune'' (December 23, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Arielle Levin Necker, [https://ctmirror.org/2016/05/17/malloy-signs-medical-marijuana-for-minors-bill/ Malloy signs medical marijuana for minors bill], ''CT Mirror'' (May 17, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uruguay==

===Legality===
Uruguay legalized cannabis in 2014. Uruguay is the first nation in the world to regulate all aspects of the cannabis market (production, sales, and consumption) for those that are at least 18 years old.&lt;ref name="Continued Opposition to Uruguay Marijuana Law and Challenge for Government" /&gt; The reason for its proposed legalization was to get rid of the organized crime and violence that came along with the illegal drug industry. Their efforts to legalize the drug were not done because of social pressure, but more so out of the efforts to protect society from the dangers that are produced from an illegal market. Uruguay’s government wanted to seize the market from criminals, not encourage individuals to smoke cannabis. The law that was put into place states that an individual can have up to six plants at their home, cannabis will be sold over the counter, buyers must sign up for a registry that permits the purchase of cannabis, and there is a 40-gram cap per month.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Room|first1=Robin|title=Legalzing a Market for Cannabis for Pleasure: Colorado, Washington, Uruguay and beyond|journal=Addiction|pages=345–349|doi=10.1111/add.12355}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Oppositions===
Despite cannabis being legalized in Uruguay, over 60 percent of people in the country believe legalization should be repealed.&lt;ref name="Continued Opposition to Uruguay Marijuana Law and Challenge for Government"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Giraldo|first1=Camilo|title=Continued Opposition to Uruguay Marijuana Law and Challenge for Government|url=http://www.insightcrime.org/news-briefs/continued-opposition-to-uruguay-marijuana-law-a-challenge-for-govt|website=InSight Crime|accessdate=18 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many individuals are doubtful that the legalization of cannabis will get rid of criminal organizations, such as the drug cartel. While criminal groups will not be able to compete with the legalized cannabis costs, they will be able to fall back on other activities such as trafficking and selling harder drugs, which can lead to larger crime.&lt;ref name="Why the first country to legalize marijuana might give up"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lopez|first1=German|title=Why the first country to legalize marijuana might give up|url=https://www.vox.com/2014/8/5/5971441/marijuana-legalization-facts-uruguay|website=Vox|accessdate=18 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because the purpose of legalization is for public health and safety reasons, publicity or advertising is against the law. Any kind of publicity of cannabis is prohibited, meaning there cannot be any billboards or advertisements for the drug.&lt;ref name="Uruguay's Drug Policy: Major Innovations, Major Challenges"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Walsh|first1=John|last2=Ramsey|first2=Geoff|title=Uruguay's Drug Policy: Major Innovations, Major Challenges|journal=Foreign Policy at Brookings|accessdate=8 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the strong opposition of legalization within Uruguay, there is no movement towards legalization of cannabis for minors.

===Effects on minors===
Despite the skepticism within society, data has shown that among regular consumers, young individuals are most likely to be the ones consuming cannabis. The age in which one can possess and consume cannabis is 18. In comparison to the United States, this is three years younger. The cannabis consumption age in Uruguay is a reflection of the drinking age, because the legal drinking age in Uruguay is 18 years old as well. Like the United States, Uruguay applied the same kind of restrictions to cannabis as they did to alcohol.

After the legalization had passed within Uruguay, there was an increase in secondary school students’ prevalence with the drug. In 2003, 8.4% of students had consumed marijuana during the previous twelve months, and in 2014, 17% had.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fernanda Boidi|first1=Maria|last2=Miguel Crus|first2=José|last3=Queiroloe|first3=Rosario|last4=Bello-Pardo|first4=Emily|title=Marijuana Legalization in Uruguay and Beyond|url=https://www.wilsoncenter.org/sites/default/files/Marijuana%20Legalization%20in%20Uruguay%20and%20Beyond_brief%20report_v3%20(2).pdf|accessdate=8 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The typical user at this age was much more likely to be male than female. There are many concerns about this increase in cannabis use, which is why new prevention strategies are being suggested, such as drug education courses.&lt;ref name="Uruguay's Drug Policy: Major Innovations, Major Challenges" /&gt;

==The Netherlands==

===Legality===
All drugs, including cannabis, are technically illegal in the Netherlands.&lt;ref name="Dutch Drug Policy"&gt;{{cite web|title=Dutch Drug Policy|url=http://www.holland.com/us/tourism/article/dutch-drug-policy.htm|website=Holland|accessdate=18 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This means it is illegal to produce, possess, and sell the drugs. Dutch police conduct about 5,000 marijuana raids annually throughout the country.&lt;ref name="In the Netherlands, 38 years of tolerating pot" /&gt; But the government designed a drug policy that tolerates cannabis use under strict conditions for those that are at least 18 years old. [[File:Coffeeshop (5821434879).jpg|thumb|225x225px|Coffeeshops are establishments in the Netherlands where the sale of cannabis for personal consumption by the public is tolerated by the local authorities.]]

====Coffee shops====
The only places individuals can really smoke cannabis is within [[Cannabis coffee shops|"coffeeshops"]].  In these coffeeshops, they sell cannabis, which is considered to be [[soft drugs]] in comparison to [[hard drugs]]; drugs such as heroin.&lt;ref name="Toleration policy regarding soft drugs and coffee shops"&gt;{{cite web|title=Toleration policy regarding soft drugs and coffee shops|url=https://www.government.nl/topics/drugs/contents/toleration-policy-regarding-soft-drugs-and-coffee-shops|website=Government of the Netherlands|accessdate=18 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of these coffee shops are to help people who use soft drugs such as cannabis, to avoid contact with hard drugs, such as heroine.&lt;ref name="Toleration policy regarding soft drugs and coffee shops" /&gt; The legal age to get into these coffeeshops is 18 years old.&lt;ref name="FAQ Coffeeshops"&gt;{{cite web|title=FAQ Coffeeshops in Amsterdam|url=http://www.iamsterdam.com/en/media-centre/city-hall/dossier-coffeeshops/faq|website=I Amsterdam}}&lt;/ref&gt; While cannabis can be sold legally through coffeeshops, trafficking the drug is illegal under Dutch law, which means that the coffeeshops have to obtain their cannabis secretly and illegally.&lt;ref name="Cannabis policy in the Netherlands: moving forwards not backwards"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rolles|first1=Steve|title=Cannabis policy in the Netherlands: moving forwards not backwards|url=http://www.tdpf.org.uk/blog/cannabis-policy-netherlands-moving-forwards-not-backwards|accessdate=18 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Criteria for coffee shops:'''&lt;ref name="Toleration policy regarding soft drugs and coffee shops" /&gt;
*must not cause any nuisance;
*are not permitted to sell hard drugs;
*are not permitted to sell cannabis to minors;
*are not permitted to advertise drugs;
*are not permitted to sell large quantities (over 5 grams of cannabis) in a single transaction.

===Effects on minors===
Many children as young as twelve years old are feeling pressured to try cannabis in the Netherlands.&lt;ref name="Netherlands to see increase in youth smoking pot; taking steps to revise cannabis laws"&gt;{{cite web|last1=McKenzie|first1=Alecia|title=Netherlands to see increase in youth smoking pot; taking steps to revise cannabis laws|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/09/22/netherlands-sees-increase_n_295192.html|website=The World Post|accessdate=8 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reason for this is because of the tolerance principle that is in place, meaning that authorities cannot prosecute someone for possessing cannabis if it is under five grams.&lt;ref name="FAQ Coffeeshops" /&gt; Because of the lack of enforcement in this, it is giving children the opportunity to possess marijuana in small amounts. Dutch youth have reported higher than average availability of cannabis, but no higher compared to the United States.&lt;ref name="What Can We Learn from the Dutch Cannabis Experience"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=MacCoun|first1=Robert|title=What Can We Learn from the Dutch Cannabis Experience|journal=RAND|accessdate=18 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many coffee shops have been shut down because of how close they are to schools. Local authorities were afraid that the location of the businesses would influence the youth and take advantage of them.&lt;ref name="Netherlands to see increase in youth smoking pot; taking steps to revise cannabis laws" /&gt;

Amsterdam's mayor, [[Eberhard van der Laan]] stated “I think the more relaxed you look at this phenomena, the easier people will stop with it because there is no thrill in using it [if it’s tolerated]".&lt;ref name="In the Netherlands, 38 years of tolerating pot"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Grether|first1=Nicole|title=In the Netherlands, 38 years of tolerating pot|url=http://america.aljazeera.com/watch/shows/america-tonight/america-tonight-blog/2014/2/21/netherlands-cannabislessonscolorado.html|accessdate=18 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is a common perception among many individuals within the Netherlands. While they fear substance abuse, citizens of the Netherlands are accepting of the decriminalization of cannabis because individuals will often start to find it "boring" and no longer want to consume cannabis.&lt;ref name="In the Netherlands, 38 years of tolerating pot" /&gt; There is currently no movement towards decriminalization or legalization of cannabis for minors.

[[New Zealand]] has taken an active role in the negotiation and drafting of several [[international human rights instruments]] including the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]], the [[Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities]], and the [[Second Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]].

== Universal Declaration of Human Rights ==

New Zealand made a number of contributions in the lead up to and in the drafting of the [https://www.un.org/en/documents/udhr/ United Nations Declaration of Human Rights] (UDHR) adopted by the [[United Nations General Assembly]] on December 10, 1948.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/en/documents/udhr/history.shtml History of the Declaration] United Nations. Retrieved 30 April 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United Nations Conference on International Organization ===

Its first involvement came in 1945 when a New Zealand delegation led by then Prime Minister [[Peter Fraser (New Zealand politician)|Peter Fraser]], attended the [[United Nations Conference on International Organization]] held in San Francisco.&lt;ref&gt;[[Colin Aikman]] “[http://www.victoria.ac.nz/law/NZACL/PDFS/Vol_4_1998/Aikman.pdf New Zealand and the Origins of the Universal Declaration]” (1999) 29 VUWLR 1 at 2.&lt;/ref&gt; This conference resulted in the creation of the [[United Nations Charter]], the founding document of the [[United Nations]] (UN).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/en/documents/charter/intro.shtml United Nations Charter: Introductory Note] Retrieved 30 April 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time of the conference, Chapter One which sets out the [[Chapter I of the United Nations Charter|purposes and principles]] of the proposed UN made no reference to human rights and fundamental freedoms.&lt;ref&gt;Aikman “New Zealand and the Origins of the Universal Declaration” (1999) 29 VUWLR 1 at 2.&lt;/ref&gt; In light of this, New Zealand proposed a new paragraph be inserted in the Article 1 stating that “All members of the organisation undertake to preserve, protect and promote human rights and fundamental freedoms, and in particular the rights of freedom from want, freedom of speech and freedom of worship.”&lt;ref&gt;Aikman “New Zealand and the Origins of the Universal Declaration” (1999) 29 VUWLR 1 at 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

The amendment was not incorporated but there are several references to human rights and fundamental freedoms in both the Preamble and in Article 1 which stipulates one of the purposes of the United Nations as being:

To achieve international co-operation in solving problems of an economic, social, cultural, or humanitarian character, and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and for fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race, sex, language, or religion.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/en/documents/charter/chapter1.shtml Charter of the United Nations Chapter 1: Purposes and Principles] Article 1 Retrieved 30 April 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Commission on Human Rights ===

New Zealand’s second major contribution occurred in relation to a draft Declaration sent to UN member governments by The [[United Nations Commission on Human Rights]] in 1947.

A special Human Rights Committee composed of the Solicitor-General, the Director of Education, the Director of the New Zealand Council of Educational Research, and four academics at Victoria University College (now [[Victoria University of Wellington]]), was formed to comment on the draft.&lt;ref&gt;Aikman “New Zealand and the Origins of the Universal Declaration” (1999) 29 VUWLR 1 at 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Subject to a few minor changes, its findings were sent to the Commission as the New Zealand Government’s views. New Zealand was one of the only countries to make such a submission.&lt;ref&gt;Aikman “New Zealand and the Origins of the Universal Declaration” (1999) 29 VUWLR 1 at 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Paris Assembly 1948 ===
Again led by Peter Fraser, a delegation attended a number of meetings held by the General Assembly's Third Committee in [[Paris]] to comment on the final drafting of the UDHR.

Originally, New Zealand expressed the view that the Declaration should not be adopted at the Paris Assembly. Rather, the [[International Bill of Rights]] consisting of the Declaration, Covenant and measures of implementation, should be adopted as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;Aikman “New Zealand and the Origins of the Universal Declaration” (1999) 29 VUWLR 1 at 4.&lt;/ref&gt; The reason for this view was that it was thought that adopting the Declaration first, intended to be a statement of principles with moral effect only, would prejudice the preparation of the Covenant. This was particularly so given that, unlike the Declaration, the Covenant created legal obligations.&lt;ref&gt;Aikman “New Zealand and the Origins of the Universal Declaration” (1999) 29 VUWLR 1 at 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Eventually, New Zealand conceded to the majority view and agreed that immediately adopting the Declaration was necessary for matters to progress.&lt;ref&gt;Aikman “New Zealand and the Origins of the Universal Declaration” (1999) 29 VUWLR 1 at 4.&lt;/ref&gt; It did, however, successfully put forward a resolution calling on the Commission on Human Rights to continue to give priority to the Covenant and measures of implementation.&lt;ref&gt;Aikman “New Zealand and the Origins of the Universal Declaration” (1999) 29 VUWLR 1 at 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

New Zealand's final contribution involved a proposal to alter the wording in Article 23(4) which is concerned with trade unions.&lt;ref&gt;Aikman “New Zealand and the Origins of the Universal Declaration” (1999) 29 VUWLR 1 at 6.&lt;/ref&gt; Originally, the text read: "Everyone is free to form and join trade unions" but after the Third Committee accepted a New Zealand wording, now reads "Everyone has the right to form and join trade unions for the protection of his interests."&lt;ref&gt;Aikman “New Zealand and the Origins of the Universal Declaration” (1999) 29 VUWLR 1 at 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities ==

New Zealand contributed significantly to the co-ordination and drafting of the [https://www.un.org/disabilities/convention/conventionfull.shtml Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities] (CRPD) which was adopted by the General Assembly on 13 December 2006 and came into force on 3 May 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/disabilities/default.asp?navid=12&amp;pid=150 CRPD Information] UN Enable. Retrieved 2 May 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

New Zealand first became involved in July 2002 when the [https://www.un.org/disabilities/default.asp?id=1423 Ad Hoc Committee], established by the General Assembly to consider proposals for a convention, held its first meeting. Represented by the New Zealand Permanent Representative to the United Nations, Don MacKay, the New Zealand [http://www.odi.govt.nz/ Office for Disability Issues] and the [http://www.mfat.govt.nz/ Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade(MFAT)] delivered a formal statement to the meeting.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.odi.govt.nz/what-we-do/un-convention/un-convention-history.html History of Convention: Negotiation Process] Office for Disability Issues. Retrieved 2 May 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

The statement:
* acknowledged that a new convention would promote and advance the rights of disabled people. 
* requested that the Committee strengthen existing human rights mechanisms and ensure disability perspectives are included in monitoring the six core UN human rights treaties.
* declared, with reference to the [http://www.odi.govt.nz/nzds/ New Zealand Disability Strategy], the importance of involving disabled people and NGOs in the future work on the Committee.
*stated that New Zealand looked forward to participating in forthcoming meetings of the Committee and to examining proposals in more depth.

Following this meeting and subsequent discussions led by the [http://www.hrc.co.nz/ Human Rights Commission] and members of the disability community in New Zealand, the New Zealand Government formally agreed to participate in the Convention negotiations in May 2003.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.odi.govt.nz/what-we-do/un-convention/un-convention-history.html History of the Convention May 2003] Office for Disability Issues. Retrieved 2 May 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

It demonstrated this commitment by funding a delegation to attend the second Ad Hoc Committee meeting at the UN in New York in June 2003. The delegation included several government officials and two representatives from the disability community.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.odi.govt.nz/what-we-do/un-convention/un-convention-history.html History of the Convention June 2003] Office for Disability Issues. Retrieved 2 May 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; At the meeting, the delegation put forward a proposal to establish a working group which would:

* consist of 27 State representatives including five from the ‘Western European and Others Group’ of which New Zealand is a member, 12 non-governmental representatives selected NGOs themselves, and one representative from Human Rights Institutions
* meet for 10 working days in New York early 2004
* prepare and circulate a draft text for negotiation at least three months before the (proposed) third session of the Ad Hoc Committee.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/esa/socdev/enable/rights/contrib-newzealand7.htm Ad Hoc Committee: Statement by Dr Jan Scown, New Zealand] UN Enable.

The Government again demonstrated its commitment to the development of the a convention when it made a written submission to the Working Group in November 2003. The submission stipulated a number of recommendations as to the approach, structure, and scope of the proposed convention.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/esa/socdev/enable/rights/wgcontrib-NewZealand.htm “New Zealand’s View of a Convention on the Rights of Disabled People” A proposed draft text by New Zealand, UN Enable.]&lt;/ref&gt;

New Zealand was given the opportunity to put these views forward further when, represented by the Director of the Office of Disability Issues, Dr Jan Scown, it was granted a place on the Working Group in December 2003.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/esa/socdev/enable/rights/ahcwg.htm Working Group Membership] UN Enable. Retrieved 3 May 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

As proposed, the Working Group met in New York for two weeks in January 2004 to develop a draft convention text.  At its first meeting on 5 January, New Zealand Ambassador, Don MacKay, was appointed to co-ordinate the group.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/esa/socdev/enable/rights/ahcwgreport.htm Report of the Working Group to the Ad Hoc Committee] UN Enable.

Retrieved 3 May 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Presented to the third Ad Hoc Committee meeting held from 24 May to 4 June 2004, the draft text acted as a basis for negotiation by member states and other stakeholders.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/esa/socdev/enable/rights/ahc3reporte.htm Ad Hoc Committee: Report of the Third Session, UN Enable] Retrieved 3 May 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; New Zealand continued its active participation by again attending this Ad Hoc Committee meeting.

Retrieved 3 May 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following this meeting, members of the New Zealand delegation sought feedback on the draft developed by the Working Group from both New Zealand government agencies and the disability community. This was used to inform the principles the delegation would aim to promote in future negotiations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.odi.govt.nz/what-we-do/un-convention/un-convention-history.html History of the Convention: May/June 2004] Office for Disability Issues.

The general negotiating principles the New Zealand delegation were guided by included:

* to promote partnerships between government and non-government organisations in national and international negotiations related to disability issues.
* to promote outcomes consistent with the principles and purposes of the New Zealand Disability Strategy, New Zealand legislation and in international human rights instruments to which New Zealand is already a party.
* to facilitate agreement between countries to a Convention text.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.odi.govt.nz/what-we-do/un-convention/un-convention-history.html History of the Convention: May/June 2004] Office for Disability Issues. Retrieved 4 May 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''OECD Anti-Bribery Convention''' (officially '''Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions''') is an [[anti-corruption]] [[Treaty|convention]] of the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]] aimed at reducing [[political corruption]] and [[corporate crime]] in [[developing countries]], by encouraging sanctions against [[bribery]] in international business transactions carried out by companies based in the Convention member countries. Its goal is to create a truly level playing field in today's international business environment. The Convention requires adherents to criminalise acts of offering or giving bribe, but not of soliciting or receiving bribes.

A 2017 study found that multinational corporations that were subject to the OECD Anti-Bribery Convention were less likely to engage in bribery than corporations that were based in non-member states.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Jensen |first=Nathan M. |last2=Malesky |first2=Edmund J. |date=2017 |title=Nonstate Actors and Compliance with International Agreements: An Empirical Analysis of the OECD Anti-Bribery Convention |url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/international-organization/article/nonstate-actors-and-compliance-with-international-agreements-an-empirical-analysis-of-the-oecd-antibribery-convention/D1C73B9EB2378B30981F8C9C99ADB4A9 |journal=International Organization |volume= |pages=1–37 |doi=10.1017/S0020818317000443|issn=0020-8183|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 1989, the [[OECD]] established an ''ad hoc'' working group for comparative review of national legislations regarding the bribery of foreign public officials. In 1994, the OECD Ministerial Council adopted the recommendation of the "Council on Bribery in International Business Transactions"; The convention was signed on 17 December 1997 and came into force on 15 February 1999.&lt;ref name=imf&gt;{{cite report| url = http://www.imf.org/external/np/gov/2001/eng/091801.pdf | title = OECD Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions| first = Jack | last = Boorman| publisher = [[International Monetary Fund|IMF]] | format = PDF| date = 2001-09-18 | accessdate = 2012-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; A revised recommendation was adopted in 2009.

==Principles==
Countries that have signed the convention are required to put in place legislation that criminalises the act of bribing a foreign public official. The OECD has no authority to implement the convention, but instead monitors implementation by participating countries via its Working Group on Bribery.  Countries are responsible for implementing laws and regulations that conform to the convention and therefore provide for enforcement. The OECD performs its monitoring function in a four-phased examination process, with Phase 4 launched on 16 March 2016.  Phase I consists of a review of legislation implementing the conventions in the member country with the goal of evaluating the adequacy of the laws.  Phase 2 assesses the effectiveness with which the legislation is applied.  Phase 3 assesses how well adherents are enforcing the Convention, the 2009 Recommendation, and any follow-up recommendations from Phase 2.  Phase 4 is intended to be a tailored review specific to the needs of the adherent country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/daf/anti-bribery/countrymonitoringoftheoecdanti-briberyconvention.htm|title=Country monitoring of the OECD Anti-Bribery Convention - OECD|website=www.oecd.org|access-date=2017-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Working Group on Bribery prepares a public report at the end of each phase.  These reports are adopted under the principle of "consensus minus one," meaning that the country under examination cannot block publication of the report.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/daf/anti-bribery/anti-briberyconvention/phase2countrymonitoringoftheoecdanti-briberyconvention.htm|title=Phase 2 country monitoring of the OECD Anti-Bribery Convention - OECD|website=www.oecd.org|access-date=2017-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Politics of Hong Kong}}
The '''pro-democracy camp''' or '''pan-democracy camp''' ([[Chinese language|Chinese]]: 民主派 or 泛民主派) refers to a political alignment that supports increased democracy, namely the [[universal suffrage]] of the [[Chief Executive of Hong Kong|Chief Executive]] and the [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong|Legislative Council]] as given by the [[Basic Law of Hong Kong|Basic Law]] under the "[[One Country, Two Systems]]" framework.

The pro-democrats generally embrace [[liberalism|liberal]] values such as rule of law, human rights, civil liberties and social justice, yet their economic positions vary. They are often identified as the "opposition camp" due to its non-cooperative and sometimes confrontational stance toward the [[Government of Hong Kong|Hong Kong SAR]] and [[Central People's Government|Chinese central governments]]. Opposite to the pro-democracy camp is the [[pro-Beijing camp]], whose members are perceived to be supportive of the central government of China. Since the handover, the pro-democracy camp has received 55 to 60 per cent of the votes in each election but returned less than a half of the seats in the [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong|Legislative Council]] due to the indirectly elected elements of the legislature.

The pro-democracy activists emerged from the youth movements in the 1970s and began to take part in electoral politics as the colonial government introduced representative democracy in the mid 1980s. The pro-democrats joined hand in pushing for greater democracy both in the transition period and after [[transfer of the sovereignty of Hong Kong|handover of Hong Kong]] in 1997. They also supported greater democracy in China and took the supporting role in the [[Tiananmen Square protest of 1989]]. The relationship between the pro-democrats and the Beijing government turned hostile after the Beijing's bloody crackdown on the protest and the pro-democrats were labelled "treason". After the [[Hong Kong legislative election, 2004|2004 Legislative Council election]], the term "pan-democracy camp" (abbreviated "pan-dems") was more in use as more different parties and politicians from different political spectrums emerged.

In the [[Hong Kong legislative election, 2016|2016 Legislative Council election]], the camp faced the challenge from the new [[localist groups (Hong Kong)|localists]] who emerged after the [[Umbrella Revolution]] and ran under the banner of "self-determination" or [[Hong Kong independence]]. After the election, some localists joined the pro-democrats' caucus which rebranded itself as "pro-democracy camp".&lt;ref name="G27"&gt;{{cite news |title=非建制「G27」共商大計 溝通平台擬正名「民主派會議」|url=http://news.mingpao.com/pns/dailynews/web_tc/article/20161008/s00002/1475864414187|newspaper=Ming Pao|date=7 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ideology ==
{{see also|Democratic development in Hong Kong|Liberalism in Hong Kong}}
The main goal of the pro-democracy camp is to achieve [[universal suffrage]] of the [[Chief Executive of Hong Kong|Chief Executive]] (CE) and the [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong|Legislative Council]] (LegCo) as guaranteed in [[Hong Kong Basic Law Article 45|Article 45]] and Article 68 of the [[Basic Law of Hong Kong|Basic Law]] respectively. Since the [[National People's Congress Standing Committee]] (NPCSC) [[831 decision|31 August 2014 decision]] that determined that Chief Executive candidate would be selected by a highly restrictive nominating committee which was seen as the betrayal of the democratic value, some democrats have raised the question of the [[right of self-determination]]. Yet, the mainstream pro-democrats remained their support of an autonomous Hong Kong under the "[[One Country, Two Systems]]" framework as promised by the Basic Law.&lt;ref name="The New York Times"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/01/world/asia/hong-kong-elections.html | title=China Restricts Voting Reforms for Hong Kong | work=The New York Times | date=31 August 2014 | accessdate=31 August 2014 |author1=Buckley, Chris |author2=Forsythe, Michael}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The pro-democrats generally embrace [[liberalism|liberal]] values such as rule of law, human rights, civil liberties and social justice, yet their economic positions vary. Some pro-democrats position themselves in a more pro-labour position, such as the [[League of Social Democrats]] (LSD), the [[Labour Party (Hong Kong)|Labour Party]] and the [[Neighbourhood and Worker's Service Centre]] (NWSC), however most pro-democrats believe in a more [[egalitarian]] society. The pro-democracy camp generally support the [[Chinese democracy movement]], in which it can trace back to their support of the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989]]. The pro-democrats have been calling for the end of [[one party rule]] of the [[Communist Party of China]] therefore are seen as threat to the Beijing authorities. Since the camp's idea of western-style liberal democracy would not be accepted easily by the Chinese government run by the Communist Party. In some cases, pan-democracy activists have been accused of [[high treason]] and as "[[traitors]] to Han Chinese".&lt;ref&gt;Jensen, Lionel M. Weston, Timothy B. [2006] (2006). China's Transformations: The Stories Beyond the Headlines. Rowman &amp; Littlefield. {{ISBN|0-7425-3863-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The pro-democrats also divide themselves with different approaches of achieving democracy: the moderate democrats represented by the [[Democratic Party (Hong Kong)|Democratic Party]] and the [[Association for Democracy and People's Livelihood]] (ADPL) believe in dialogue with Beijing and Hong Kong governments over struggle, while radical democrats such as the League of Social Democrats and the [[People Power (Hong Kong)|People Power]] believe in street actions and mass movements. There have been serve conflicts and distrust between the two factions and a great split after the [[2010 Hong Kong electoral reform|constitutional reform voting]] in 2010, where the Democratic Party negotiated with the Beijing representatives and supported the modified reform proposal and was seen as a betrayal by the radical democrats.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | last = | first = | title = A more united Democratic Party predicted as Young Turks leave | pages =   | newspaper = South China Morning Post | location = Hong Kong | date = 20 December 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
=== Early development ===
Members of the camp include social workers and social activists emerged from the 1970s youth movements. Many of them grouped themselves as the "social action faction", competing against the pro-Communist [[Maoists]] in whom they disagreed with their ultra-nationalist and radical Maoist stances. Although claiming to be patriotic and launching the [[Baodiao movement|defend the Diaoyu Islands movement]], the "social action faction" dedicated themselves into the local social issues in Hong Kong. They fought for the social inequality and livelihood issues, including the anti-corruption movement and Chinese Language movement and so forth. In the early 1980s when the question of Hong Kong sovereignty emerged, many of them supported a democratic autonomous Hong Kong under Chinese sovereignty, notably the [[Meeting Point]] which was founded in January 1983 which became the first political group to publicly support the Chinese sovereignty of Hong Kong.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Political Change and the Crisis of Legitimacy in Hong Kong|last=Scott|first=Ian|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|page=210}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[Sino-British Joint Declaration]], the pro-democrats began to join hands to demand further democracy before and after 1997. In 1986, a number of political groups, activists, professionals and politicians joined hand under the banner of the [[Joint Committee on the Promotion of Democratic Government]] (JCPDG) demanding for [[Hong Kong legislative election, 1988|1988 direct elections]] for the [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong|Legislative Council]] and earlier [[universal suffrage]] for the [[Chief Executive of Hong Kong|Chief Executive]] and Legislative Council after 1997, as presented in the proposal of the [[Group of 190]].&lt;ref name="dictionary"&gt;{{cite book|title=Political Dictionary for Hong Kong|location=Hong Kong|year=1990|publisher=Macmillan Publishers (HK) Ltd|author1-first=Stephen|author1-last=Davies|author2-first=Elfed|author2-last=Roberts}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their arch rival at the time was the [[Group of 89]], a group of conservative business and professional elites in the [[Hong Kong Basic Law Drafting Committee]] (HKBLDC) and [[Hong Kong Basic Law Consultative Committee]] (HKBLCC). They generally opposed the British colonial administration and its perceived "[[kowtowing]]" to the Beijing government over the issues such as constitutional reform, direct elections, civic rights and [[Daya Bay Nuclear Plant]].&lt;ref name="dictionary"/&gt;

The pro-democrats maintained a relatively warm relationship with the Beijing government during the 1980s, as many of the pro-democrats supported the Chinese sovereignty in Hong Kong and the "high degree of autonomy" as ensured in the Sino-British Joint Declaration. They also saw the ideal of Hong Kong helping in China's [[Four Modernisations]].&lt;ref name="dictionary"/&gt; The Beijing authorities also viewed the pro-democrats as the targets of the [[PRC United Front strategy|united front]]. Barrister [[Martin Lee]] and educator [[Szeto Wah]], president of the [[Hong Kong Professional Teachers' Union]], who were also the two most visible pro-democracy leaders, were appointed members of the Hong Kong Basic Law Drafting Committee in 1985 by Beijing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Underground front|last=Loh|first=Christine|year=2010|publisher=Hong Kong University Press|page=158}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The pro-democrats also participated in electoral politics as direct elections were introduced in local levels in the 1980s, namely the [[District Council of Hong Kong|District Boards]], [[Urban Council]] and [[Regional Council (Hong Kong)|Regional Council]]. Among them, the Meeting Point formed in 1983, the [[Hong Kong Affairs Society]] in 1985 and [[Association for Democracy and People's Livelihood]] in 1986 became the three major pro-democratic groups and formed a strategic alliance in the [[Hong Kong local elections, 1988|1988 District Board elections]], which laid the foundation of the pro-democracy grassroots supports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Politics of Democratization in Hong Kong|last=Lo|first=Shiu-hing|pages=143-145|year=2016|publisher= Springer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Tiananmen protests and last colonial years ===
The consolidation of its public support has its roots in opposition to the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989|1989 Tiananmen crackdown]] which aroused widespread horror, sympathy and support of the protesters by Hong Kong citizens.&lt;ref name="Wingk"&gt;Wing-kai Chiu, Stephen. Lui, Tai-Lok. The Dynamics of Social Movement in Hong Kong. [2000] (2000). Hong Kong University Press. {{ISBN|962-209-497-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The pro-democrats, who were heavily involved in the protests and formed the [[Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements in China]] (ADSPDMC or Alliance), were seen as "treason" and threat to the Beijing government. The two pro-democracy Basic Law Drafting Committee members, Martin Lee and Szeto Wah, were stripped from the office after they resigned in protest of the bloody crackdown, many of other pro-democrats were denied entry to the Mainland China since. Since 1989, the Alliance organise [[Memorials for the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989|annual candlelight vigil]] for the June 4 crackdown at the [[Victoria Park, Hong Kong]], which draw thousands of people every year. Ahead of the [[Hong Kong legislative election, 1991|first direct election to the Legislative Council in 1991]], around 600 democracy activists co-founded the first major pro-democracy party, the [[United Democrats of Hong Kong]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Challenge of Hong Kong's Reintegration with China: Modern Diasporic Femininity|first=Ming K.|last=Chan|publisher=Hong Kong University Press|year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sing"&gt;{{cite book|title=Hong Kong's Tortuous Democratization: A Comparative Analysis|first=Ming|last=Sing|year=2004|publisher=Psychology Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The electoral alliance of United Democrats of Hong Kong and Meeting Point, together with other smaller political parties, groups and independents, won a historical landslide victory in the 1991 election, took 17 out of the 18 geographical constituency seats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://hkjo.lib.hku.hk/archive/files/9a143dfa460b1378f2b447a98a057d8e.pdf|journal=Asian Journal of Public Administration|first=Ian|last=Scott|title=An Overview of the Hong Kong Legislative Council Elections of 1991|volume=13|number=2|year=1991|pages=11–37}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pro-democrats were often considered strategic allies of [[Chris Patten]], the last [[governor of Hong Kong|colonial governor]] who proposed a [[1994 Hong Kong electoral reform|much progressive democratic reform]] in the last years before the [[handover of Hong Kong]], despite Beijing's strong opposition. The Democrats supported Patten's proposal for the [[Hong Kong legislative election, 1995|1995 Legislative Council election]]. However, [[Emily Lau]]'s full-scale direct election amendment was not passed as a result of Meeting Point's abstaining from voting for Emily Lau, which caused harsh criticism from the radical democrats and the [[United Ants]].&lt;ref name="Sing"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Dynamics of Social Movement in Hong Kong|first1=Stephen Wing-Kai|last1=Chiu|first2=Dale|last2=Lü|first3=Tai-Lok|last3=Lui|publisher=Hong Kong University Press|year=2000|page=43}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1994, the United Democrats and the Meeting Point merged into the [[Democratic Party (Hong Kong)|Democratic Party]], which won another landslide victory in the 1995 election, taking 19 seats in total, far ahead of other parties. Together with other democratic parties and individuals including Emily Lau, [[Lee Cheuk-yan]] and [[Leung Yiu-chung]] who later formed [[The Frontier (Hong Kong)|The Frontier]] in 1996 and [[Christine Loh]] who formed the [[Citizens Party (Hong Kong)|Citizens Party]] in 1997, the pro-democrats gained a thin majority in the legislature for the last two years before 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Save Our Harbour |url=http://www.citizensparty.org/save_our_harbour1.html |work=The Citizens Party |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19991109235018/http://www.citizensparty.org/save_our_harbour1.html |archivedate=9 November 1999 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=PAST POLITICAL RECORD - CHRISTINE KUNG-WAI LOH |url=http://www.citizensparty.org/eclppr.html |work=The Citizens Party |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19991003224637/http://www.citizensparty.org/eclppr.html |archivedate=3 October 1999 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Beijing government argued that the electoral reform introduced by Patten had violated the Joint Declaration and thus they no longer felt obliged to honour the promise of a "through train", a plan to keep the 1995 elected legislature into post-handover SAR era. A parallel Legislative Council, the [[Provisional Legislative Council]], was formed in 1996 under the control of the Pro-Beijing camp, this became the Legislative Council upon the founding of the new SAR government in 1997, in which the pro-democrats except for the Association for Democracy and People's Livelihood boycotted it, deeming it as unconstitutional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Underground front|last=Loh|first=Christine|year=2010|publisher=Hong Kong University Press|page=187}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Handover to China and 1 July 2003 protest ===
All of its members, except the [[Association for Democracy and People's Livelihood]], declined to join the extralegal Provisional Legislative Council installed by the government of the [[People's Republic of China]], and were ousted from the territory's legislature for a year until the 1998 election. Starting from the 1998 election, since the [[Plurality voting system|plurality]] electoral system was changed to [[proportional representation]], compounded with the restoration of corporate votes in the functional constituencies, and replacement of broad-based functional constituencies with traditional ones, the number of seats of the camp dipped, albeit having similar share of vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Hong Kong's Tortuous Democratization: A Comparative Analysis|first=Ming|last=Sing|year=2004|publisher=Psychology Press|page=158}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within the camp, share of smaller parties and independents increased relatively, with the share of the Democratic Party falling from around two-thirds in 1995 to less than a half by 2004.

The pro-democracy camp was the strong opposition to the [[National Security (Legislative Provisions) Bill 2003|national security and anti-subversion legislation]] of the [[Hong Kong Basic Law Article 23|Basic Law Article 23]] and they successfully called for [[Hong Kong July 1 marches#2003|over 500,000 people to protest]] on 1 July 2003 against the legislation, the largest demonstration since the handover.&lt;ref name="Wyc"&gt;Wong, Yiu-Chung. One Country, Two Systems in Crisis: Hong Kong's Transformation Since the Handover. Lexington books.&lt;/ref&gt; The pro-democrats received victories in the subsequent [[Hong Kong district councils election, 2003|2003 District Councils]] and [[Hong Kong legislative election, 2004|2004 Legislative Council]] elections. The barrister-formed Article 23 Concern Group formed by the pro-democracy lawyers, which transformed into [[Article 45 Concern Group]], saw its member [[Audrey Eu]], [[Alan Leong]] and [[Ronny Tong]] were elected in the 2004 election. In 2006, the group formed the middle class and professional oriented [[Civic Party]].&lt;ref name="WikiLeaks"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/09HONGKONG558_a.html|title=CIVIC PARTY: MOVING FROM FAN CLUB TO POLITICAL FORCE|work=WikiLeaks}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, the left-wing radical group [[League of Social Democrats]] was formed in the same year by [[Trotskyist]] legislator [[Leung Kwok-hung]] and radical radio host [[Wong Yuk-man]]. As a result of the diversification of the pro-democracy elements, the use of "pan-democrats" gained in popularity, as it is typically meant to be non-denominational and all-inclusive.

In the [[Hong Kong Chief Executive election, 2007|2007 Chief Executive election]], Civic Party's [[Alan Leong]] successfully gained enough nominations to challenge the incumbent Chief Executive [[Donald Tsang]], but he was not elected as expected due to the control of the [[Election Committee]] by the pro-Beijing camp. After the [[Hong Kong legislative election, 2008|2008 Legislative Council election]], The Frontier merged into the Democratic Party and the convenor [[Emily Lau]] was elected vice chair of the party.&lt;ref name="merge"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.scmp.com/portal/site/SCMP/menuitem.2c913216495213d5df646910cba0a0a0/?vgnextoid=e5cccaa974acd110VgnVCM100000360a0a0aRCRD&amp;vgnextfmt=teaser&amp;ss=Hong+Kong&amp;s=News|title=Frontier members vote for Democrats merger|work=South China Morning Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2012 reform package and the Split ===
[[Donald Tsang]], the Chief Executive, promised to resolve the question of universal suffrage in his office during the election. He carried out the [[2012 constitutional package]] in 2009 which was criticised by the pro-democracy as lack of genuine progress. The [[League of Social Democrats]] called for a ''[[de facto]]'' [[referendum]], by way of the [[Hong Kong by-election, 2010|2010 by-elections]] in five geographical constituencies.&lt;ref&gt;Associated Press (11 March 2010), [http://us.asiancorrespondent.com/breakingnews/hong-kong-china-debate-legality-of-.htm "Hong Kong, China debate legality of referendum"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100411001011/http://us.asiancorrespondent.com/breakingnews/hong-kong-china-debate-legality-of-.htm |date=11 April 2010 }}, Asian Correspondent. Retrieved on 5 April 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Civic Party]], the second largest pro-democratic party joined, however the Democratic Party, the largest party, was reluctant to participate. The Democratic Party and other moderate democrats and pro-democracy scholars launched the [[Alliance for Universal Suffrage]] and started to engage with the mainland officials. The Democratic Party brought out a revised proposal of the package to Beijing and the revised proposal was passed in the Legislative Council in the support of the government and Pro-Beijing camp.&lt;ref name=cheers&gt;Cheung, Gary; Wong, Albert &amp;  Fung, Fanny (25 June 2010) "Cheers and jeers for political reform vote", ''South China Morning Post''&lt;/ref&gt;

However, it triggered a major split within the camp and also in the Democratic Party. The Young Turks including the LegCo member [[Andrew Cheng]] quit the party and formed the [[Neo Democrats]]. The Democratic Party was accused by the LSD and the radicals of betraying democracy and its supporters. On the matter of whether to coordinate with the moderate democrats in the [[Hong Kong local elections, 2011|2011 District Council elections]], the League of Social Democrats was suffered in the factional fighting and the two of the three LSD legislators left the party in disarray and formed the [[People Power (Hong Kong)|People Power]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chinaelectionsblog.net/hkfocus/?p=192|title=Politicking Hong Kong Style|last=Pepper|first=Suzanne|date=15 November 2010|accessdate=3 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The People Power's campaign targeted pan-democracy parties in the 2011 District Council elections that had supported the reform package filled candidates to run against them but only won one seat of 62 contested.

Nevertheless, the People Power managed to win three seats in the [[Hong Kong legislative election, 2012|2012 Legislative Council election]] and the radical democrats of the (People Power and the League of Social Democrats) topped 264,000 votes, compared to the Civic Party's 255,000 and Democratic Party's 247,000 respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?pp_cat=11&amp;art_id=126488&amp;sid=37663755&amp;con_type=1|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130412221536/http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?pp_cat=11&amp;art_id=126488&amp;sid=37663755&amp;con_type=1|dead-url=yes|archive-date=12 April 2013|title=Change on way for Democrats, says Sin|accessdate=3 April 2013|last=Luk|first=Eddie|date=17 September 2012|newspaper=The Standard}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the pan-democrats securing three of the five newly created, [[District Council (second)]] constituency seats the ratio of the vote share between the pan-democrats and the [[pro-Beijing camp]] narrowed significantly from the traditional 60% to 40%, to 55% to 45%.

The chairman of the Democratic Party [[Albert Ho]] represented the pan-democracy camp to run in the [[Hong Kong Chief Executive election, 2012|2012 Chief Executive election]]. On election day the pan-democrats declined to vote for neither [[Henry Tang]] nor [[Leung Chun-ying]] and called for a [[spoilt vote|blank vote]] from the electors.&lt;ref name=blank20120322hks&gt;Siu, Phila (22 March 2012).

===2014 Umbrella Revolution===
In March 2013, all 27 democratic legislators formed the [[Alliance for True Democracy]] (ATD), replacing the Alliance for Universal Suffrage, to show solidarity of the camp to fight for genuine democracy. The ATD put forward a three-channel proposal for the [[Hong Kong Chief Executive election, 2017|2017 Chief Executive election]] during the [[2014 Hong Kong electoral reform|constitutional reform consultation]] in 2014. However, the decision of the [[National People's Congress Standing Committee]] (NPCSC) on 31 August ruled out the possibility for any candidate not endorsed by Beijing to be nominated for the election, which the pan-democrats accused as a betrayal of the principle of "one person, one vote," The pan-democrats had supported legal scholar [[Benny Tai]]'s [[Occupy Central with Love and Peace|Occupy Central]] plan of civil disobedience against Beijing's decision, which later turned into a [[2014 Hong Kong protests|79-day occupy protest]] which often dubbed as "Umbrella Revolution".&lt;ref name="The New York Times"/&gt; On 18 June 2015, all 27 pan-democrat legislators and [[Medical (constituency)|Medical]] legislator [[Leung Ka-lau]] voted against the government's constitutional reform bill while the pro-Beijing legislators launched a failed walk-out. The bill was defeated by 28 against 8 for, barely meeting the quorum of 35.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=ejinsight|first=Hang-chi|last=Lam|url=http://www.ejinsight.com/20150618-and-so-we-stagger-into-an-even-more-uncertain-future/|date=18 June 2015|title=And so, we stagger into an even more uncertain future}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many new political groups emerged from the Umbrella Revolution often distanced themselves from the pan-democrats. Many of whom, being labelled as "[[localism in Hong Kong|localists]]", criticised pan-democrats' failing in achieving democracy in the last 30 years. Many of them called for more "militant" tactics over pan-democrats' "non-violent" principles and "China–Hong Kong separation" over the some mainstream pan-democrats' mild "Chinese nationalist sentiment".&lt;ref name="Lau"&gt;{{cite news|title=Independent thinker Horace Chin treads bold path|first=Stuart|last=Lau|date=10 June 2013|url=http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/article/1257295/independent-thinker-horace-chin-treads-bold-path|newspaper=South China Morning Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of them also criticised pan-democrats' demand of the vindication of the 1989 Tiananmen protests, as pursued by the [[Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements in China]] (HKASPDMC). There was also growing voice for [[Hong Kong independence]] from the Chinese rule, as many of whom deemed the "One Country, Two Systems" had failed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hong Kong Makes History with First Pro-Independence Rally|first=Liam|last=Fitzpatrick|work=TIME|url=http://time.com/4440708/hong-kong-independence-china-localist/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2016/17 elections and aftermath===
In the [[Hong Kong legislative election, 2016|2016 Legislative Council election]], [[localist groups (Hong Kong)|localists]] with different banners together took away 19 per cent of the vote share from the pan-democrats, in which the traditional pan-democrats secured only 36 per cent, 21 less than the previous election. The non-establishment forces secured 30 out of the 70 seats, in which pan-democrats took 23 seats. After the election, the 27-member pro-democrats' caucus rebranded themselves into "pro-democracy camp" or "G27", as three backers of the "self-determination" of Hong Kong, namely [[Nathan Law]], [[Lau Siu-lai]] and [[Eddie Chu]] joined the caucus.&lt;ref name="G27"/&gt; The "G27" soon became "G26" after Chu left the caucus shortly afterwards.

In the [[Hong Kong Election Committee Subsector elections, 2016|2016 Election Committee subsector election]], the pro-democrat coalition "Democrats 300+" scored a record victory in the [[Election Committee]] which was responsible for electing the [[Hong Kong Chief Executive election, 2017|2017 Chief Executive]]. The democrats decided not to field their candidate in order to boost the chance of an alternative establishment candidate against incumbent [[Leung Chun-ying]]. After Leung announced he would not seek for re-election, the pro-democrats turned against [[Chief Secretary for Administration]] [[Carrie Lam]] who was seen as "C.Y. 2.0". The pro-democrats nominated former [[Financial Secretary of Hong Kong|Financial Secretary]] [[John Tsang]] and retired judge [[Woo Kwok-hing]] amid the [[Liaison Office (Hong Kong)|Liaison Office]] actively lobbied for Lam. Ahead of the election, some 98 per cent of the "Democrats 300+" coalition decided on voting for Tsang as he was the most popular candidate in the polls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Pan-democrats pledge more than 290 votes for John Tsang in Hong Kong leadership race|url=http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/politics/article/2080573/pan-democrats-promise-more-290-votes-john-tsang-hong-kong|date=20 March 2017|newspaper=South China Morning Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 14 July 2017, [[Leung Kwok-hung]] of the [[League of Social Democrats]], Nathan Law of the [[Demosisto]], [[Yiu Chung-yim]] and Lau Siu-lai were unseated from the Legislative Council over [[Hong Kong Legislative Council oath-taking controversy|their manners at the oath-taking ceremony]] at the inaugural meeting as a result of the legal action from the Leung Chun-ying government and the interpretation of the [[Hong Kong Basic Law]] by the [[National People's Congress Standing Committee]] (NPCSC), following the disqualification of two pro-independence legislators, [[Youngspiration]]'s [[Baggio Leung]] and [[Yau Wai-ching]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Four More Hong Kong Lawmakers Ousted In a Blow to Democratic Hopes|url=http://time.com/4856181/hong-kong-lawmakers-oath-china-disqualified/|work=TIME|date=17 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The pro-democrats suffered a defeat in the [[Hong Kong by-election, 2018|by-election]] for four of the six vacancies on 11 March 2018, losing the [[Kowloon West (constituency)|Kowloon West]] geographical constituency and [[Architectural, Surveying, Planning and Landscape (constituency)|Architectural, Surveying, Planning and Landscape]] functional constituency to the pro-Beijing candidates. Yiu Ching-yim who contested in Kowloon West was defeated by [[Vincent Cheng (DAB politician)|Vincent Cheng]] of the DAB with a thin margin, making it the first time a pro-democrat lost in a [[single-member district]] election since the handover. The vote share of the pro-democrats also dropped from the traditional 55 per cent to only 47 per cent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hong Kong democrats to rely on legal appeals after failing to win back Legco veto foothold|url=http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/politics/article/2136762/pan-democrats-look-set-regain-power-veto-rivals-moves-hong|newspaper=South China Morning Post|date=12 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Raymond Vahan Damadian''' (born March 16, 1936) is an American physician, medical practitioner, and inventor of the first MR (Magnetic Resonance) Scanning Machine.&lt;ref&gt;http://lemelson.mit.edu/resources/raymond-v-damadian&lt;/ref&gt;

Damadian's research into sodium and potassium in living cells led him to his first experiments with nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) which caused him to first propose the MR body scanner in 1969. Damadian discovered that [[tumor]]s and normal tissue can be distinguished in vivo by [[nuclear magnetic resonance]] (NMR) because of their prolonged [[Relaxation (NMR)|relaxation times]], both T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ([[spin-lattice relaxation]]) or T&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ([[spin-spin relaxation]]). Damadian was the first to perform a full body scan of a human being in 1977 to diagnose [[cancer]]. Damadian invented an apparatus and method to use NMR safely and accurately to scan the human body, a method now well known as magnetic resonance imaging ([[MRI]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.mit.edu/invent/iow/damadian.html Inventor of the Week Archive]&lt;/ref&gt;

Damadian has received several prizes. In 2001, the [[Lemelson-MIT Prize]] Program bestowed its $100,000 Lifetime Achievement Award on Damadian as "the man who invented the MRI scanner."&lt;ref name="web.mit.edu"&gt;[http://web.mit.edu/invent/a-winners/a-damadian.html Lemelson-MIT Lifetime Achievement Award on Dr. Damadian as "the man who invented the MRI scanner"]&lt;/ref&gt; He went on to collaborate with [[Wilson Greatbach]], one early developer of the implantable pacemaker, to develop an MRI-compatible pacemaker. [[The Franklin Institute]] in Philadelphia gave its recognition of Damadian's work on MRI with the [[The Franklin Institute Awards|Bower Award]] in Business Leadership.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2004/03/23/science/denied-nobel-for-mri-he-wins-another-prize.html Raymond Damadian wins the [[Bower Award for Business Leadership|Bower Award]] in Business Leadership from the [[Franklin Institute]] in Philadelphia]&lt;/ref&gt; He was also named Knights of Vartan 2003 "Man of the Year".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-88187554.html Raymond V.

Damadian was born in [[New York City|New York]], to an [[Armenians|Armenian]] family, Vahan and Odette (née Yazedjian). He earned his bachelor's degree in mathematics from the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]] in 1956, and an M.D. degree from the [[Albert Einstein College of Medicine]] in [[New York City]] in 1960. He studied the [[violin]] at [[The Juilliard School|Juilliard]] for 8 years,&lt;ref name="newsday"&gt;{{cite news | title = Woodbury, N.Y., Medical Inventor Continues Lone Quest against Nobel Committee. | date = 2003-10-21 | url = http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-119698305.html | publisher = New York Newsday | accessdate = 2007-08-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and played in Junior [[Davis Cup]] [[tennis]] competitions.&lt;ref name=chuvala&gt;Chuvala, Bob, [http://www.crosswalk.com/11622229/ Looking Right Through You], Crosswalk.com, Christianity Today International, 1 January 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;George B. Kauffman, [https://armenianweekly.com/2013/11/07/2003-nobel-prize-for-mri-denied-to-raymond-vahan-damadian/ 2003 Nobel Prize for MRI Denied to Raymond Vahan Damadian], ''The Armenian Weekly'', November 7, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

He met his future wife, Donna Terry, while he had a job as a tennis coach. She invited him to the 1957 [[Billy Graham]] crusade at [[Madison Square Garden]], and he responded to the [[altar call]]. Raymond and Donna married a year after he finished medical school,&lt;ref name=chuvala /&gt; and they had three children. Raymond says that he first became interested in detecting cancer when, as a boy of 10, he saw his maternal grandmother, with whom he was very close, die painfully of breast cancer.&lt;ref name=gifted-mind&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kinley|first1=Jeff|last2=Damadian|first2=Raymond|year=2015|title=Gifted Mind: The Dr. Raymond Damadian Story, Inventor of the MRI|publisher=[[Master Books]]|isbn=978-0890518038}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Magnetic resonance imaging===
[[Image:Damadian invention.jpg|thumb|right|Raymond Damadian's "Apparatus and method for detecting cancer in tissue."]] 
Damadian's early work on NMR concerned investigating potassium ions inside cells.&lt;ref name="Nature"&gt;Cope, F. and Damadian, R., “Cell potassium by &lt;sup&gt;39&lt;/sup&gt;K spin echo nuclear magnetic resonance”, ''Nature'' '''228'''(5266):76–77, 3 October 1970 | doi:10.1038/228076a0.&lt;/ref&gt; He found that the potassium relaxation times were much shorter compared with aqueous solutions of potassium ions.  This suggested that potassium was not free but complexed to ‘fixed-charge’ counter-ions, as he had previously determined.&lt;ref name="Science1969"&gt;Damadian, R., “Ion Exchange in ''Escherichia coli:'' Potassium-Binding Proteins”, ''Science'' '''165'''(3888):79–81, 4 July 1969 | doi:10.1126/science.165.3888.79.&lt;/ref&gt;

He and other researchers independently investigated the signals of &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H NMR in cells, and found that the relaxation times were much shorter than in distilled water. This was consistent with ordering of a large part of the water by [[adsorption]] onto [[macromolecule|macromolecular]] surfaces.  Damadian predicted that cancerous cells would have longer relaxation times, both because of the disordering of malignant cells and because of their elevated potassium levels, since the potassium ions would be ‘structure-breaking’ to the ordered water fraction.{{fact|date=June 2017}}

In a 1971 paper  in the journal ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'',&lt;ref name="Science"&gt;Damadian, R. V. “Tumor Detection by Nuclear Magnetic Resonance”, ''Science'' '''171'''(3976):1151–1153, 19 March 1971 | doi:10.1126/science.171.3976.1151.&lt;/ref&gt; SUNY Downstate Medical Center professor Damadian reported that [[tumor]]s can be detected in vivo by [[nuclear magnetic resonance]] (NMR) because of much longer relaxation times than normal tissue. He suggested that these differences could be used to detect [[cancer]], even in the early stages where it would be most treatable, though later research would find that these differences, while real, are too variable for diagnostic purposes. However, Damadian in his seminal paper claimed only that his method was a ''detection'' tool, making no claim about being a diagnostic tool, but intended that it would provide a non-invasive way of detecting cancers and monitoring the effectiveness of their therapy.{{fact|date=June 2017}}

According to a ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' article,&lt;ref name="wallstjournal"&gt;{{cite news | title = Scan and Deliver | date = 2002-06-14 | url = https://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB1024015606998071840 | publisher = Wall Street Journal | accessdate = 2007-08-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Damadian's initial methods were flawed for practical use,&lt;ref name="SydneyMorningHerald"&gt;{{cite news | title = The man who did not win | date = 2003-10-17 | url = http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/10/16/1065917548433.html | publisher = Sydney Morning Herald | accessdate = 2007-08-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; relying on a point-by-point scan of the entire body and using relaxation rates, which turned out to not be an effective indicator of cancerous tissue.  However, the same article pointed out, “Nevertheless, his observation of T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and T&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; differences in cancerous tissue was a Eureka moment for [[Paul Lauterbur]].”  Furthermore, Damadian's seminal paper&lt;ref name="Science" /&gt; documented in its Table 2 that T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; relaxation times were different, beyond experimental uncertainty, across all his samples over different healthy tissues: rectus muscle, liver, stomach, small intestine, kidney, and brain.  This showed the way to accurate imaging of the body's soft tissues for the first time; X-ray imaging was severely deficient for soft tissue analysis because the difference in absorption was so small (&lt;4%). 
So when in the court case [[Fonar v. General Electric]], GE's attorneys made the same claim that relaxations times were also prolonged in non-cancerous tissue, so were not a good diagnostic, Fonar's attorneys responded that it was unfair to punish Damadian because his methods detected even ''more'' features than he had intended. Indeed, even today, 90% of [[Magnetic resonance imaging#How MRI works|MRI scans]] on patients produce images that are relaxation dependent, either T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;- or T&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-dependent images.
 
In 1974, he received the first patent in the field of MRI when he patented the concept of NMR&lt;ref&gt;{{US patent|3789832}}&lt;/ref&gt; for detecting cancer after filing an application in 1972—now there are over 4,500 patents on MRI. As the [[National Science Foundation]] notes, “The patent included the idea of using NMR to ‘scan’ the human body to locate cancerous tissue.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sri.com/policy/csted/reports/techin/mri3.html NSF history] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120103150438/http://www.sri.com/policy/csted/reports/techin/mri3.html |date=2012-01-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it did not describe a method for generating pictures from such a scan or precisely how such a scan might be done.&lt;ref name="armenianreporter"&gt;{{cite news | title = Does Dr. Raymond Damadian Deserve the Nobel Prize for Medicine? | date = 2003-11-08 | url = http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-89000528.html | publisher = The Armenian Reporter | accessdate = 2007-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; But without Damadian's discovery of the profound sensitivity of the relaxation time to different tissue types and malignant tissue, there would be no picture at all.{{fact|date=June 2017}}
	
In the 1950s, [[Herman Carr]] reported &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.physicstoday.org/vol-57/iss-7/p83a.html Physics Today July 2004 - Field Gradients in Early MRI&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060630152505/http://www.physicstoday.org/vol-57/iss-7/p83a.html |date=2006-06-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; creating a one-dimensional MR image. Prompted by Damadian's report on the potential medical uses of NMR, [[Paul Lauterbur]] expanded on Carr's technique and developed a way to generate the first MRI images, in 2D and 3D, using gradients. [[Peter Mansfield]] from the [[University of Nottingham]] then developed a mathematical technique that would allow scans to take seconds rather than hours and produce clearer images than Lauterbur had. While Lauterbur and Mansfield focused on animals and human limbs, Damadian built the first full-body MRI machine&lt;ref name="SydneyMorningHerald"/&gt; and produced the first full [[magnetic resonance imaging]] ("MRI") scan of the human body, albeit using a “focused field” technique that differs considerably from modern imaging. In recording the history of MRI, Mattson and Simon (1996) credit Damadian with describing the concept of whole-body NMR scanning, as well as discovering the NMR tissue relaxation differences that made this feasible.{{fact|date=June 2017}}

===First human MRI body scan===
On July 3, 1977, the first MRI body exam was performed on a human being&lt;ref name="Image"&gt;Damadian R. V., Goldsmith M., and Minkoff L., “NMR in cancer: XVI. FONAR image of the live human body”, ''Physiol. Chem. Phys.'' '''9'''(1):97–100, 1977.&lt;/ref&gt; (the first human scan was performed by Peter Mansfield's team in Nottingham a year earlier, on fellow author Andrew Maudsley’s finger). It took almost five hours to produce one image: a 106-[[voxel]] point-by-point scan of Larry Minkoff's [[thorax]]. The images were rudimentary by modern standards. Damadian, along with colleagues Larry Minkoff and Michael Goldsmith took seven years to reach this point. They named their original machine “Indomitable” to capture the spirit of their struggle to do what many said could not be done, though no systems would ever use Damadian's method. His technique of imaging was never made into a practically usable method and has therefore never been used in MR imaging as we know it today.

His patent followed on the heels of rumors already floating throughout the scientific community of Lauterbur's proposed idea of using NMR ''in vivo'' (still in the human body, an imaging device).  However, in 1969, Damadian had previously proposed NMR as a method for external scanning of internal cancers in the body, i.e. ''in vivo'':

:I am very much interested in the potential of NMR spectroscopy for early non-destructive detection of internal malignancies. … I will make every effort myself, and through collaborators, to establish that all tumors can be recognized by their potassium relaxation times or H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O-proton spectra and proceed with the development of instrumentation and probes that can be used to scan the human body externally for early signs of malignancy. Detection of internal tumors during the earliest states of their genesis should bring us very close to the total eradication of the disease.&lt;ref&gt;Damadian, R., 1969, September 17. Letter to [[George. S. Mirick]], Scientific Director, The Health Research Council of the City of New York, Department of Health.”&lt;/ref&gt;

Though it would later turn out to be irreproducible, in his 1971 ''Science'' paper, Damadian showed different NMR signals for tumors and different tissue types:&lt;ref name="Science"/&gt;

:In principle, nuclear magnetic resonance [NMR] techniques combine many of the desirable features of an external probe for the detection of internal cancer.

This was clearly influential, as Lauterbur wrote in 1986:

: … the attention of the medical community was first attracted by the report of Damadian&lt;ref name="Science"/&gt; that some animal tumors have remarkably long water proton relaxation times.
: … even long normal tissues differed markedly among themselves in NMR relaxation times, and I wondered whether there might be some way to noninvasively map out such quantities within the body.&lt;ref name="Lauterbur Cancer"&gt;Lauterbur, P. C. “Cancer detection by Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Zeugmatographic Imaging”, ''Cancer'' '''57''':1899–1904, 15 May 1986 | doi:10.1002/1097-0142(19860515)57:10&lt;1899::AID-CNCR2820571002&gt;3.0.CO;2-4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus it was the discovery of strongly variant relaxation times that led to Lauterbur's quest to represent these relaxation time differences graphically. Without these differences, unknown until Damadian's work, there would be nothing to make an image with. Hence a book on MRI history, which included chapters on both Damadian and Lauterbur, Chapter 8 entitled, “Raymond V. Damadian: Originator of the Concept of Whole-Body NMR Scanning (MRI) and Discoverer of the NMR Tissue Relaxation Differences That Made It Possible.”&lt;ref name="Pioneers of NMR"&gt;Mattson, J. and Simon, M., ''The Pioneers of NMR and Magnetic Resonance in Medicine: The Story of MRI'', Bar-Ilan University Press, Jericho, New York, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; The book pointed out the importance of both men:
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Damadian MRI.jpg|thumbnail|Raymond Damadian next to the MRI machine]] --&gt;
:Because of the contributions of Dr Raymond Damadian and Dr Paul Lauterbur, magnetic resonance imaging has become the most powerful and reliable diagnostic tool in medicine. …
:Millions of people the world over enjoy a higher quality of life and many lives have been saved, thanks to the contributions of Damadian and Lauterbur.

:NMR scanning resulted from two essential steps. They were taken by the two great MRI pioneers of this volume, Dr Raymond Damadian and Dr Paul Lauterbur. Dr Damadian provided the first step, the discovery of tissue NMR signal differences from which the image is made and the first concept of an NMR body scanner that would utilize these signal differences to detect disease in the human body. Dr Lauterbur provided the next step of visualizing these signal differences as an image and supplied the first method for acquiring these signals at practical speeds. It does not seem likely that MRI could have come to pass without the key steps contributed by both scientists.

:Without Damadian’s discovery, it could not be known that serious diseases like cancer could be detected by an NMR scanner or that tissue NMR signals possessed sufficient contrast to create medically useful images. Without Lauterbur’s contribution, development of a practical method for visualizing these signal differences as an image might have occurred much less efficiently. Moreover, the incredible amount of courage and pugnacity shown by Damadian, working alone with only two students, without any consistent granting, thus leading him to do most of the development of his system as a self-made man learning when required, electronics, machining, welding and many other technologies in order to built his first prototype, is exemplary for any researcher. This have to be compared with the working conditions of Lauterbur or Mansfield, both working with comfortable fundings in spacious laboratories with many colleagues and students. At least from the point of view of the merit, the work of Damadian, indeed, is considerable. …

:Recognizing their achievements, the President of the United States awarded the nation’s highest honor in technology, the national Medal of Technology, jointly to Dr Damadian and Dr Lauterbur for the development of MRI. In presenting the award on July 15, 1988, President Ronald Reagan cited both scientists ‘for their independent contributions in conceiving and developing the application of magnetic resonance technology to medical uses including whole-body scanning and diagnostic imaging.&lt;ref name="Pioneers of NMR"/&gt;

Damadian's machine is now in the [[Smithsonian Institution]]. As late as 1982, there were a handful of MRI scanners in the entire United States; today there are thousands.

===Fonar Corporation===
In 1978, Damadian formed his own company, Fonar&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://finapps.forbes.com/finapps/jsp/finance/compinfo/CIAtAGlance.jsp?tkr=FONR |title=Fonar - Stock Quote Analysis At A Glance |publisher=forbes.com |date= |accessdate=2010-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; (which stood for "Field Focused Nuclear Magnetic Resonance"), for the production of MRI scanners, and in 1980, he produced the first commercial one. Damadian's "focused field" technology proved less effective than Lauterbur's gradient approach. His scanner, named "Indomitable," failed to sell. Fonar eventually abandoned Damadian's technique in favour of the methods adopted by Lauterbur and Mansfield.&lt;ref&gt;[https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20090927103214/http://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/object_jun00.html The "Indomitable" MRI | Science &amp; Nature]&lt;/ref&gt; Damadian and Fonar enforced the [[royalties]] on patents held by Damadian.&lt;ref&gt;[https://ecf.nyed.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/qrySummary.pl?20562 Fonar v. Hitachi]&lt;/ref&gt; They settled with many large companies, but a [[Fonar v. General Electric|case]] against [[General Electric]] went to the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit|Federal Circuit]], which upheld a $129 million ruling against GE for violation of Damadian's patents.&lt;ref name="nytimescontro"&gt;{{cite news | title = Doctor Disputes Winners of Nobel in Medicine | date = 2003-10-11 | url = https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?sec=technology&amp;res=950CE7D7153FF932A25753C1A9659C8B63 | publisher = New York Times | accessdate = 2007-08-04 | first=Nicholas | last=Wade}}&lt;/ref&gt; Damadian says that the judgment money has all been put back into Fonar for research and development purposes.

Damadian is the company's largest shareholder, with 8% of stock worth $6.5 million.&lt;ref name="newsday"/&gt; Despite owning only 8% of the stock, he maintains almost 100% control of the company through a separate class of shares (Class C) that only Damadian controls 2007.&lt;ref&gt;shareholder proxy statement&lt;/ref&gt; Damadian later collaborated with [[Wilson Greatbatch]], one early developer of the implantable [[artificial pacemaker|pacemaker]], to develop an MRI-compatible pacemaker. He invented a stand-up MRI system and has 15 MRI scanning centers across the United States. There are a number of independent MRI centers that use this technology both in the U.S. and around the world. The company conceived and built the world's first Upright Multi-Positional MRI, which was recognized as The Invention of the Year in 2007 by the Intellectual Properties Owners Association Education Foundation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = National Inventor of the Year Award’ Goes to Raymond V.

===Creationism===
In the February 4, 2014 [[Bill Nye–Ken Ham debate]], Damadian was one of the scientists who recorded themselves on video professing a belief in [[young Earth creationism]] for [[Answers in Genesis]] president [[Ken Ham]] to cite.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Chowdhury|first=Sudeshna|title=Bill Nye versus Ken Ham: Who Won? |magazine=Christian Science Monitor|date=February 5, 2014|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-357806905.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Nye|first1=Bill|last2=Ham|first2=Ken|title=Bill Nye Debates Ken Ham (video - 165:32)|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6kgvhG3AkI|date=February 4, 2014|work=[[YouTube]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Damadian promoted Answers in Genesis, belief in a young earth, and his Christian faith in other occasions,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Science for God’s Glory: Interview with Dr. Raymond Damadian|url=https://answersingenesis.org/creation-scientists/science-for-gods-glory|date=July 1, 2014|publisher=''Answers in Genesis''|accessdate=February 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ham|first1=Ken|title=Famous Scientist at the Creation Museum—and He’s a Biblical Creationist!|url=https://answersingenesis.org/blogs/ken-ham/2014/07/27/famous-scientist-at-the-creation-museum-and-hes-a-biblical-creationist|date=July 27, 2014|publisher=[[Answers in Genesis]]|accessdate=February 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; including in his co-authored 2015 book ''Gifted Mind''.&lt;ref name=gifted-mind /&gt;

==Awards and honors==
Damadian received a [[National Medal of Technology]] in 1988 and was inducted into the [[National Inventors Hall of Fame]]&lt;ref name="SydneyMorningHerald"/&gt; in 1989. His original MRI full-body scanner was given to the [[Smithsonian Institution]] in the 1980s and is now on loan and on display at the National Inventors Hall of Fame in Ohio.&lt;ref name="economistmristory"&gt;{{cite news|title=MRI's inside story|date=2003-12-04|url=http://www.economist.com/obituary/displaystory.cfm?story_id=E1_NNQGTGG|publisher=The Economist|accessdate=2007-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, the [[Lemelson-MIT Prize]] Program bestowed its $100,000 Lifetime Achievement Award on Damadian as "the man who invented the MRI scanner."&lt;ref name="web.mit.edu"/&gt; 

The [[Franklin Institute]] in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]] gave its recognition of Damadian's work on MRI with the Bower Award in Business Leadership. He was named the [[Knights of Vartan]] 2003 "Man of the Year." In September 2003, he was honored with the Innovation Award in Bioscience from ''[[The Economist]]''.&lt;ref name="economistmristory"/&gt;

===Nobel Prize controversy===
In 2003, the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] was awarded to [[Paul Lauterbur]] and Sir Peter Mansfield for their discoveries related to MRI. Although Nobel rules allow for the award to be shared by up to three recipients, Damadian was not given the prize. The controversy over who played what part in the development of the MRI had gone on for years prior to the Nobel announcement, and many in the scientific community felt that the Nobel had not been awarded for the MRI for so long due to debate over Damadian's role in its development.&lt;ref name="wallstjournal"/&gt;

Damadian said that credit should go to "me, and then Lauterbur," and Lauterbur felt that only he should get credit. In 1997 the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]] commissioned a timeline of MRI milestones, and four of the 12 in an initial draft were attributed to Damadian. At the final publication in 2001, longer than any other publication in the series had ever been taken, none of the milestones were attributed to Damadian. The text said that Damadian's methods had "not proved clinically reliable in detecting or diagnosing [[cancer]]."&lt;ref name="wallstjournal"/&gt; After Damadian's [[lawyer]]s sent the NAS a threatening letter, the text on the NAS website was revised, but not to Damadian's satisfaction. Damadian said in 2002, "If I had not been born, would MRI have existed? I don't think so. If Lauterbur had not been born? I would have gotten there. Eventually."&lt;ref name="wallstjournal"/&gt;

The ''New York Times'' wrote:&lt;blockquote&gt;The issue has been the subject of a dispute between Dr. Damadian and Dr. Lauterbur and has been known for years in academic circles, with some fearing that the Nobel committee would steer clear of magnetic resonance imaging altogether because of the Swedes' supposed distaste for controversial discoveries. Dr. Lauterbur, 74, is not in good health, and the committee may have decided that its prize, which cannot be given posthumously, needed to be awarded for the discovery now or never.".&lt;ref name="nytimescontro"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

After the announcement of Lauterbur and Mansfield's Nobels, between October and November 2003, an ad hoc group called "The Friends of Raymond Damadian" (formed by Damadian's company FONAR&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FONAR press release|url=http://www.fonar.com/news/101603.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;) took out full-page advertisements in ''[[The New York Times]]'' twice, ''[[The Washington Post]]'', ''[[The Los Angeles Times]]'' and one of the largest newspapers in [[Sweden]], ''[[Dagens Nyheter]]'' protesting his exclusion with the headline "The Shameful Wrong That Must Be Righted"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fonar.com/nobel.htm The Shameful Wrong That Must Be Righted]&lt;/ref&gt; in an attempt to get the Nobel Committee to change its mind and grant him a share of the Prize.&lt;ref name="newsday"/&gt;&lt;ref name="wallstjournal2"&gt;{{cite news|title=Conduct Unbecoming|author=Gelernter, David|date=2003-11-27|url=http://opinionjournal.com/taste/?id=110001844l|publisher=Wall Street Journal|accessdate=2007-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Damadian suggested that Lauterbur and Mansfield should have rejected the Nobel Prize unless Damadian was given joint recognition. Supporting Damadian were various MRI experts including John Throck Watson, Eugene Feigelson, V. Adrian Parsegian, David Stark and James Mattson.{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}} ''[[New York Times]]'' columnist [[Horace Freeland Judson]] criticised this behavior, noting that there is "no Nobel Prize for whining" and that many deserving candidates who may have had better claims than Damadian, such as [[Lise Meitner]], [[Oswald Avery]] and [[Jocelyn Bell]], had been previously denied a share of the Nobel.&lt;ref name="nytimesnobel"&gt;{{cite news | title = No Nobel Prize for Whining | author = Judson, Horace | date = 2003-10-20 | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2003/10/20/opinion/no-nobel-prize-for-whining.html | publisher = ''New York Times'' | accessdate = 2018-05-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he had to admit that [[Erwin Chargaff]], whose [[Chargaff's rules|two rules]] were instrumental in the discovery of DNA's structure, was very vocal about his omission, and [[Fred Hoyle]] was irate about [[Jocelyn Bell]]'s exclusion.{{cn|date=March 2017}}

Others point out that while Damadian had hypothesized that NMR relaxation times might be used to detect cancer, he did not develop (nor did he suggest) the current way of creating images.&lt;ref name="armenianreporter"/&gt; Since the Nobel Prize was awarded to Lauterbur and Mansfield for the development of Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ''Imaging'', Damadian's exclusion makes more sense. Some felt that research scientists sided with Lauterbur because he was one of their own, while Damadian was a physician who had profited greatly from his early patents.&lt;ref name="wallstjournal"/&gt; Charles Springer, an expert in MRI at Oregon Health and Science University, said that if a poll was taken of the academic community, most would agree with the [[Nobel Committee]]'s conclusions.&lt;ref name="nytimescontro"/&gt; And Mansfield wrote in his autobiography that "the person who really missed out" the prize was [[Erwin Hahn]] for his contribution to the principles of [[spin echoes]].&lt;ref name="Mansfield217"&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter Mansfield|year=2013|pages=217|title=The long road to Stockholm. The story of MRI. An autobiography|isbn=978-0-19-966454-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chemist [[George Kauffman]] argued that Damadian deserved the Nobel:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Undoubtedly, both Damadian and Lauterbur made major contributions to MRI imaging and scanning. Without Damadian’s relaxation discoveries that showed sharp discrimination between tissues and particularly a serious disease like cancer, there would have been no reason to entertain or even consider a method for displaying the relaxation differences so that they could be visualized as an image. Furthermore, except for the relaxation differences discovered by Damadian, there would be no reason to expect that such an image would show anything, i.e., that any tissue NMR contrast existed with which to make an image.
Science and technology are two distinctly different enterprises. Science is the branch of knowledge dedicated to compiling factual information and understanding natural phenomena. It precedes technology, and technology cannot advance without it. Without science’s new knowledge of natural phenomena, technology’s new methods for exploiting and taking advantage of nature’s secrets cannot be created. The new scientific information is necessarily the first step.
'''Moreover, there is no doubt that Damadian’s seminal discovery preceded Lauterbur’s developments.''' &lt;ref&gt;Kauffman, G., “[http://chemeducator.org/bibs/0019001/19140073.html Nobel Prize for MRI Imaging Denied to Raymond V. Damadian a Decade Ago]”, ''Chemical Educator'' '''19''':73–90, 2014; bold in original, archived at [http://www.fonar.com/pdf/NOBEL%20PRIZE%20FOR%20MRI%20DAMADIAN,%20GBK,%20CHEM%20EDUCATOR,%2019,%2019,73-90%20%28MARCH%2021,%202014%29.pdf fonar.com/]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Philosopher [[Michael Ruse]] writing for the [[Metanexus Institute]] suggested that Damadian might have been denied a Nobel prize because of his creationist views, saying:
&lt;blockquote&gt;I cringe at the thought that Raymond Damadian was refused his just honor because of his religious beliefs. Having silly ideas in one field is no good reason to deny merit for great ideas in another field. Apart from the fact that this time the Creation Scientists will think that there is good reason to think that they are the objects of unfair treatment at the hands of the scientific community.&lt;ref&gt;Ruse, M. "The Nobel Prize in Medicine—Was there a religious factor in this year’s (non) selection?", ''[[Metanexus Online Journal]]'', March 16, 2004, reproduced at [http://www.armeniandiaspora.com/showthread.php?514-The-Nobel-Prize-in-Medicine-Was-there-a-Religious-Factor-this-Year#.T1CCVvWDl8E]. Also quoted in Edmond Y. Azadian "[https://mirrorspectator.com/2016/10/20/why-not-aznavour/ Why Not Aznavour?]" ''The Armenian Mirror Spectator'' October 20, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Damadian himself said, "Before this happened, nobody ever said to me 'They will not give you the Nobel Prize for Medicine because you are a creation scientist'. If people were actively campaigning against me because of that, I never knew it."&lt;ref name="SydneyMorningHerald"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24792">The '''2013 Republican Party of Virginia convention''' was the process by which the [[Republican Party of Virginia]] selected its nominees for the offices [[Governor of Virginia|Governor]], [[Lieutenant Governor of Virginia|Lieutenant Governor]], and [[Attorney General of Virginia|Attorney General]] for the [[Virginia elections, 2013|2013 general election]] in November. The convention was held on May 17 and 18, 2013, in the state capital of [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]] at the [[Richmond Coliseum]].

[[Ken Cuccinelli]]'s [[de facto]] nomination for governor was confirmed by [[acclamation]] at the convention. There were seven candidates for lieutenant governor; after an epic ten-hour, four-ballot battle, [[E.W. Jackson]] emerged as the nominee in an upset over better-funded candidates. [[Mark Obenshain]] narrowly defeated [[Rob Bell (Virginia politician)|Rob Bell]] for the attorney general nomination.

==Background==
===Cuccinelli vs. Bolling and switch to convention===
In 2008, incumbent Lt. Governor [[Bill Bolling]] made a deal with then-Attorney General [[Bob McDonnell]] whereby McDonnell would run for governor and Bolling would run for re-election as lieutenant governor in [[Virginia gubernatorial election, 2009|2009]], and then Bolling would receive McDonnell's support for his own candidacy for governor in 2013.  The deal was widely known and as such, Bolling was effectively running for Governor since 2009,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/virginia-politics/post/rep-eric-cantor-to-endorse-lt-gov-bill-bolling-over-atty-gen-ken-cuccinelli-in-governors-race/2012/06/07/gJQAPRtKLV_blog.html Rep. Eric Cantor to endorse Lt. Gov. Bill Bolling over Atty. Gen. Ken Cuccinelli in governor’s race]&lt;/ref&gt; and in April 2010, Bolling filed the necessary paperwork to run in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[http://voices.washingtonpost.com/virginiapolitics/2010/04/post_672.html Bolling forms committee to run for governor in 2013]&lt;/ref&gt; Virginia Attorney General [[Ken Cuccinelli]], elected alongside McDonnell and Bolling in 2009, stated that he intended to run for re-election as attorney general in 2013, but did not rule out running for Governor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://washingtonexaminer.com/article/117374#.ULWvvNffSc0 Cuccinelli denies plans for Senate run]&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2011, Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli told his staff that he would run against Bolling for governor in 2013; the news went public, and in response, Bolling issued a statement accusing Cuccinelli of putting "his own personal ambition ahead of the best interests of the commonwealth and the Republican Party."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/virginia-politics/post/ken-cuccinelli-announces-he-will-run-for-va-governor-in-2013/2011/12/01/gIQAH2kjHO_blog.html Ken Cuccinelli announces he will run for Va. governor in 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2011/dec/20/bolling-ties-2013-hopes-to-romney/ Bolling ties 2013 hopes to Romney]&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.politico.com/blogs/davidcatanese/1211/Cuccinelli_I_have_decided_to_run_for_governor.html Cuccinelli: 'I have decided to run for governor]&lt;/ref&gt; This infuriated Bolling and set up a [[primary election|primary]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/virginia-politics/post/ken-cuccinelli-announces-he-will-run-for-va-governor-in-2013/2011/12/01/gIQAH2kjHO_blog.html Ken Cuccinelli announces he will run for Va. governor in 2013]&lt;/ref&gt; Cuccinelli's announcement came two days before the annual statewide conference of Virginia Republicans, at which Bolling and his staff expressed being upset with Cuccinelli's decision.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2011/dec/4/cuccinelli-bid-upsets-bolling-backers-at-retreat/?page=all Cuccinelli’s bid for Va. governor upsets Bolling and his backers]&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2012, the party's State Central Committee, which had new members since the committee previously voted to hold a primary, reversed course and voted 47-31 to select a nominee via convention in 2013, igniting much controversy among party members.&lt;ref name="APswitch"&gt;[http://hamptonroads.com/2012/06/virginia-gop-picks-closed-convention-2013 Virginia GOP picks closed convention for 2013]&lt;/ref&gt; The switch was a major blow to Bolling's candidacy, as Cuccinelli supporters were more ardent and involved in the party and thus more willing to travel to a day-long convention.&lt;ref name="WTswitch"&gt;[http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2012/jun/15/va-gop-switches-primary-convention-make-2013-guber/ Va. GOP switches from primary to convention to make 2013 gubernatorial nomination]&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents of the reversal said a convention would prevent [[Democratic Party of Virginia|Democrats]] from meddling in the selection (Virginia does not register voters by party, making primaries open to voters regardless of party).&lt;ref name="WTswitch"/&gt; Primaries are also run by the State Board of Elections and taxpayer funded; proponents said a convention, which is funded by the party, would save the state money.&lt;ref name="APswitch"/&gt; Convention proponents also argued that nominees selected by convention historically perform better in the general election than nominees selected by primary, and that conventions allow candidates to present their cases within the party, preventing candidates from tearing each other down via negative advertising seen by the general electorate.&lt;ref name="APswitch"/&gt; Opponents of the reversal said a convention would disenfranchise military voters who are unable to physically attend a convention, and would cost the party too much money.&lt;ref name="APswitch"/&gt; Bolling called the switch "unprecedented and unfair".&lt;ref name="WTswitch"/&gt;

On November 28, 2012, Bolling withdrew from the race, in a "recognition of how difficult it would be [for him] to win the nomination", making Cuccinelli the de facto nominee.&lt;ref&gt;[http://theroanokestar.com/2012/11/28/lt-governor-bill-bolling-exits-virginia-governors-race-2/ Lt. Governor Bill Bolling Exits Virginia Governor’s Race]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Importance of office of lieutenant governor===
The lieutenant governor of Virginia is a part-time role and has historically been a largely ceremonial post, with the primary responsibility being breaking the rare 20-20 tie in the 40-member [[Senate of Virginia]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Aky-V0CFFWEC&amp;pg=PA9&amp;lpg=PA9&amp;dq=virginia+lieutenant+governor+ceremonial+role&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=yXC0jUsWHl&amp;sig=yWBVJ2EFbAx-tYIbdnbeJlmVGlU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=KpyZUcnQGYay0QGUsYD4Ag&amp;ved=0CFsQ6AEwCDgK#v=onepage&amp;q=virginia%20lieutenant%20governor%20ceremonial%20role&amp;f=false] ''Virginia's Native Son: The Election and Administration of Governor L. Douglas Wilder'' by J.L. Jeffries, {{ISBN|9781557534118}}]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A36813-2005Jun1.html Lt. Governor Hopeful Plans 6 Offices Across Va.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://voices.washingtonpost.com/virginiapolitics/2011/02/virginias_lieutenant_governor.html UPDATED: Virginia lieutenant governor breaks rare Senate tie]&lt;/ref&gt; The office is also seen as a stepping stone to the office of governor.&lt;ref name="FFLS"&gt;[http://news.fredericksburg.com/newsdesk/2013/04/13/lt-governor-race-crowded-heated/ Lt. governor race crowded, heated]&lt;/ref&gt; However, the practical importance of the office increased dramatically after the [[Virginia elections, 2011|2011 state Senate elections]] created an evenly divided Senate with 20 Republicans and 20 Democrats, making the lieutenant governor's tiebreaking power critical and determining which party holds control of the Senate.&lt;ref name="FFLS"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://hamptonroads.com/2011/11/virginia-republicans-claim-victory-state-senate Virginia Republicans claim victory in state Senate]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Speculation and field====
After the 2011 elections, there was much speculation as to who the nominee for the office would be, since Bolling was vacating the seat.&lt;ref name="WPhopefuls"&gt;[https://articles.washingtonpost.com/2011-11-16/local/35281522_1_lieutenant-governor-republican-candidates-virginia-republicans Corey Stewart, Keith Fimian among hopefuls weighing 2013 run for Va. lieutenant governor]&lt;/ref&gt; Potential candidates who considered bids but did not run included Mark Obenshain, former GOP congressional nominee [[Keith Fimian]], and state Sen. [[Jeff McWaters]].&lt;ref name="WPhopefuls"/&gt; Obenshain ended up running for attorney general; Fimian began raising money but decided not to run for the sake of his family;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.coreystewart.com/2012/04/10/stewart-to-run-for-lieutenant-governor/ Stewart to run for lieutenant governor]&lt;/ref&gt; and speculation on McWaters waned and he never entered the race.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hamptonroads.com/2012/10/mcwaters-says-no-governor-run-undecided-lg McWaters says 'no' to governor run, undecided on LG]&lt;/ref&gt;

The field began taking shape in mid-2012. [[Prince William County]] Board of Supervisors Chairman [[Corey Stewart (politician)|Corey Stewart]] was the first to enter the race, announcing his bid in April 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.fredericksburg.com/on-politics/2012/04/11/prince-william-republican-corey-stewart-announces-run-for-lg/ Prince William Republican Corey Stewart announces run for LG]&lt;/ref&gt; State Sen. [[Steve Martin (Virginia politician)|Steve Martin]] of [[Chesterfield County, Virginia|Chesterfield]] announced he was running in June 2012 (on the same day that he filled in for Bolling in presiding over a [[pro forma]] session of the Senate).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/virginia-politics/post/virginia-sen-stephen-martin-plans-run-for-lt-governor/2012/06/20/gJQAc7ieqV_blog.html Virginia Sen.

===Attorney General race===
Cuccinelli's run for governor meant the attorney general's office was open in 2013. Within two weeks, three candidates announced bids for the office in 2013. State Sen. Mark Obenshain of [[Harrisonburg, Virginia|Harrisonburg]] announced he was exploring a run on December 2, 2011,&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.roanoke.com/politics/2011/12/02/obenshain-exploring-run-for-attorney-general/ Obenshain exploring run for attorney general]&lt;/ref&gt; shortly after Cuccinelli announced he was running for governor, and formally entered the race nearly a year later in November 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.roanoke.com/politics/2012/11/27/obenshain-kicks-off-run-for-attorney-general/ Obenshain kicks off run for attorney general]&lt;/ref&gt; On December 6, 2011, Delegate [[Rob Bell (Virginia politician)|Rob Bell]] of [[Charlottesville, Virginia|Charlottesville]] entered the race. [[Fairfax County]] [[Court clerk|Circuit Court Clerk]] John Frey entered the race the next day.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-state-of-nova/post/fairfax-clerk-john-frey-announces-run-for-virginia-attorney-general/2011/12/07/gIQAIs6lcO_blog.html Fairfax Clerk John Frey announces run for Virginia attorney general]&lt;/ref&gt; Frey dropped out in November 2012, saying his opponents had spent more time campaigning across the state than he did.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesdispatch.com/news/republican-john-frey-withdrawing-from-va-attorney-general-s-race/article_3f8582d8-3891-11e2-a360-0019bb30f31a.html  Republican John Frey withdrawing from Va. attorney general's race]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Convention proceedings==
===Approval of rules===
The convention was called to order on the afternoon of May 17, 2013. Rules for the convention, which were previously released, were adopted, and the convention then recessed.

The rules required a full 50% + 1 vote majority to win the nomination in each race. Multiple ballots were anticipated for the lieutenant governor race, as none of the seven candidates were expected to reach a majority so quickly. Only one ballot was required for attorney general. In the lieutenant governor balloting, if no candidate reached a majority after the first ballot, the bottom two candidates with the least votes would be eliminated, and five candidates would be on the second ballot. On the second ballot, the bottom two would be eliminated, and three candidates would be on the third ballot. If no candidate reached a majority after the third ballot, the third candidate would be eliminated, and the two remaining candidates would be on the fourth and final ballot.

===Nomination of Cuccinelli===
The convention was called back to order on the morning of May 18, 2013. Cuccinelli was formally nominated by acclamation as thousands of delegates roared "aye" on the motion to nominate him for governor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wjla.com/articles/2013/05/ken-cuccinelli-set-for-gop-nomination-for-virginia-governor-88991.html Ken Cuccinelli nominated for governor by Virginia GOP]&lt;/ref&gt; In his acceptance speech, Cuccinelli stressed his record, contrasting his years of public service in Virginia with his Democratic opponent [[Terry McAuliffe]]'s career. He rolled out a vision including specific calls for reforms of the tax code, education, and regulations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.talkradionews.com/news/2013/05/18/text-of-ken-cuccinellis-acceptance-speech-at-richmond-convention.html#.UZmupcqNAg8 Text of Ken Cuccinelli’s Acceptance Speech at Richmond Convention]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Candidate speeches===
According to the rules, candidates for lieutenant governor and attorney general were allotted seven minutes each to speak before the delegates. The most notable speech was that of E.W. Jackson, who electrified the crowd in an impassioned speech in which he rejected the label of "African-American", declaring, "I am not an African-American, I am an American! I am tired of the hyphenation. No more hyphenation!"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.news-reporter.com/news/2013-06-13/Opinions/GUEST_COLUMN.html ‘Let liberty light the way’]&lt;/ref&gt; He also vowed to "get the government off our backs, off our property, out of our families, out of our health care and out of our way."&lt;ref name="WPsettles"&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/va-politics/va-republicans-set-to-nominate-statewide-ticket-for-2013/2013/05/18/a616f92a-bf67-11e2-9b09-1638acc3942e_story.html Va.

Jackson for Lt. Governor nominee]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nomination of Mark Obenshain===
Obenshain defeated Bell on the first ballot by a margin of 55%-45%.&lt;ref name="55pct"&gt;[http://www.whsv.com/news/headlines/Obenshain-Celebrates-Republican-Nomination-208090831.html#.UZm8XMqNAg8 Mark Obenshain Celebrates Republican Nomination]&lt;/ref&gt; After the ballots were counted, Bell came to the podium and motioned to withdraw his candidacy and nominate Obenshain for attorney general. Obenshain was then nominated by acclamation. Obenshain's nomination came 35 years after his father, [[Richard D. Obenshain]], received the Republican nomination for the [[United States Senate]] on the same stage at the Richmond Coliseum in May 1978. Richard Obenshain was killed in a plane crash a few months after his nomination. Mark Obenshain was joined by his mother, Richard's widow, on the stage to accept the nomination.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/05/18/state-sen-mark-obenshain-nominated-for-virginia-attorney-general-by-gop/ State Sen. Mark Obenshain nominated for Virginia attorney general by GOP]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nomination of E.W. Jackson===
Chaos and conflicting statements went around the convention during the second, third, and fourth ballots in what appeared to be a stop-Jackson movement by the Snyder campaign. Snyder received the endorsements of tea party activist [[Jamie Radtke]], and from Lingamfelter after his elimination, during balloting, which the campaign posted on flyers around the Coliseum. In the fourth round of balloting, flyers were distributed on the floor falsely claiming that Cuccinelli, Obenshain, and Stewart endorsed Snyder for the fourth ballot.&lt;ref name="RTD"&gt;[http://www.timesdispatch.com/news/latest-news/article_ff488808-bfc9-11e2-87fd-001a4bcf6878.html Virginia GOP convention: Jackson wins LG nomination as Snyder withdraws]&lt;/ref&gt; All three of those campaigns denounced the flyers, and Stewart endorsed Jackson, even taking a lap around the floor with him to show his support.&lt;ref name="RTD"/&gt;

Shortly after 10:00 pm [[Eastern Daylight Time|EDT]], after eight hours of voting and four ballots, Pete Snyder went to the stage and motioned to withdraw his candidacy and nominate E.W. Jackson for lieutenant governor by acclamation. After a loud "aye" from the delegates, Jackson took to the stage, and after a short victory speech, was joined by Cuccinelli and Obenshain, as the 2013 Republican ticket was presented.&lt;ref name="WPsettles"/&gt; 

===Voting===
Convention voting used a weighted vote system in which votes were allocated to local city or county unit committees based on their city's or county's population. Each vote cast could be worth more or less than one weighted vote depending on how many votes were cast from that unit.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}

====First ballot====
Obenshain won the attorney general race with 55% of both the weighted vote and the raw vote.&lt;ref name="round1"/&gt; Per the rules, Davis and Martin were eliminated after the first ballot as they placed sixth and seventh, respectively, out of seven candidates.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="868">'''Retirement slump''' refers to the average falloff in the party’s vote when the incumbent retires. A positive value of the sophomore surge represents an incumbency advantage. The retirement slump should be positive for an incumbency advantage to exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.democ.uci.edu/research/conferences/gradconf/democracyanditsdevelopment/uppalpaper.pdf |title=trial.dvi |date= |format=PDF |accessdate=2008-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sophomore surge]] is the average vote gain for freshman winners in election 1 who run again in election 2. Retirement slump is the average vote loss for the parties whose candidates won election 1 and did not run in election 2.&lt;ref&gt;http://gking.harvard.edu/files/inc.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

When a [[Sophomore surge]] and a Retirement slump combine, it is what is called a [[slurge]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20951">'''Richard Cizik''' is President of the New Evangelical Partnership for the Common Good.  He was the Vice President for Governmental Affairs of the [[National Association of Evangelicals]] (NAE) and one of the most prominent [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical]] [[lobbyist]]s in the [[United States]].&lt;ref name="NAE"&gt;[http://www.nae.net/index.cfm?FUSEACTION=nae.staff&amp;navGroup=OGA National Association of Evangelicals Executive Leaders]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Grist"&gt;[http://www.grist.org/news/maindish/2005/10/05/cizik/ Cizik Matters: An interview with green evangelical leader Richard Cizik], by Amanda Griscom Little, ''[[Grist Magazine]]'', October 5, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;  In his position with the NAE, Cizik's primary responsibilities were setting the organization's policy on issues and lobbying the [[White House]], [[United States Congress|Congress]], and the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]].&lt;ref name="NAE" /&gt;  Cizik also served as NAE's national spokesman and edited a monthly magazine, ''NAE Washington Insight''.&lt;ref name="NAE" /&gt;  Since 2003, Cizik has been active in a type of environmentalism known as "[[creation care]]"; his stance on [[global warming]] has drawn both support and criticism from fellow Evangelicals.&lt;ref name="CT article" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Moyers"&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/moyers/moyersonamerica/green/index.html Is God Green?], by [[Bill Moyers]], ''Moyers on America'', [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]], 2006&lt;/ref&gt; He serves on the Board of Advisors of the [[Nicholas Institute for Environmental Policy Solutions]].

In 2008, he and [[Nobel Prize]] winner [[Eric Chivian]], as a team, were named one of the 100 [[Time 100|most influential scientists and thinkers]] by ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/specials/2007/article/0,28804,1733748_1733754_1736213,00.html Eric Chivian &amp; Richard Cizik].&lt;/ref&gt; On December 11, 2008, Cizik gave his resignation from his position with NAE after a December 2 radio broadcast of [[NPR]]'s [[Fresh Air]] in which he voiced support for same-sex civil unions.&lt;ref name="CT article" /&gt;&lt;ref name="SFGATE"&gt;[http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/n/a/2008/12/11/national/a144713S91.DTL&amp;tsp=1 Top evangelical resigns after backing gay unions], by Eric Gorski, "[[San Francisco Chronicle]]", December 11, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; His comments and his resignation has generated both strong support and strong criticism within the evangelical Christian community.&lt;ref name=ABC&gt;[http://abcnews.go.com/US/story?id=6491162&amp;page=1 New Evangelists Buck the Christian Right]. [[ABC News]]. Published December 19, 2008. Accessed December 19, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2010, Cizik launched the [[New Evangelical Partnership for the Common Good]] together with [[David P. Gushee]], professor of Christian Ethics at Mercer University, and Steve Martin, a pastor and documentary filmmaker.&lt;ref name="CP article"&gt;[http://www.christianpost.com/article/20100124/evangelicals-call-for-cancellation-of-haiti-s-foreign-debt/index.html New Evangelical Group Calls for Haiti Debt Cancellation], by Michelle A. Vu, "[[The Christian Post]]", January 24, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;  The faith-based non-profit, which represents the merger of the previously distinct but sometimes interrelated efforts of the three founding partners, reportedly exists "to advance human well-being as an expression of our love for Jesus Christ, which is itself a grateful response to his love for us and for a good but suffering world."&lt;ref name="NEP"&gt;[http://www.newevangelicalpartnership.org/?q=node/4 New Evangelical Partnership for the Common Good]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Cizik graduated with a B.A., cum laude, in political science from [[Whitworth College]], received an M.A. in Public Affairs from the George Washington University School of Public &amp; International Affairs (now called the Elliot School of International Affairs), a Master of Divinity from Denver Seminary and an honorary doctorate in Christian Leadership from the Methodist Episcopal Church.&lt;ref&gt;Duke University, "[http://nicholasinstitute.duke.edu/people/cizik Board of Advisors - Rev. Richard Cizik - Nicholas Institute]". Accessed 2 May 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 18, 2014, Whitworth University, awarded Cizik an honorary Doctorate of Humane Letters. The University's Provost stated that "Richard Cizik, an alumnus from the class of 1973, is a pastor, writer, environmentalist, thinker, and activist...For his commitment to truth and to the Lordship of Jesus Christ, to the health of our planet and the well-being of humanity, and in recognition of his strength of purpose and his courage in speaking out on crucial issues as a thoughtful and fully committed man of God, I am proud to represent Whitworth University as we confer upon Richard Cizik this degree of doctor of humane letters, honoris causa."

He was awarded a post-graduate fellowship from the Scottish Rite Foundation to study at the George Washington University (1973-1974) and by the Rotary International Foundation to study at the Political Science University in Taipei, Taiwan (1975-1976).  Cizik sits on advisory boards of the Institute on Religion and Public Policy, the Nicholas Institute for Environmental Policy Solutions at Duke University, and the Evangelical Environmental Network.

Cizik was named in 2006 by Beliefnet to be one of the "Most Inspirational" leaders of the year.

In 2007, Virginia Governor Tim Kaine named Cizik to the Virginia Climate Commission.  That appointment has led to his speaking on climate change at the University of Virginia, Eastern Mennonite University, Roanoke College, among many other universities around the country.

Fast Company magazine named him in 2008 to a list of "Most Creative Thinkers."  He was named an Open Society Fellow of the Open Society Institute in 2009-2010, during which time he built relationships between scholars and activists on topics such as war and peace, climate change, and criminal justice.

In 2010, he was named to a list of "Fifty Evangelical Leaders Who Shaped a Generation: The Renegade," by Roof Top Blog, WordPress and appeared in the acclaimed documentary on nuclear arms, directed by Lucy Walker and distributed by Participant Media, entitled "Countdown To Zero."  Cizik has subsequently been a regular participant in Global Zero gatherings, including Summits held in London, England, and the Ronald Reagan Library in Simi Valley, California, and as a speaker at the Global Zero Inaugural Conference, held in Paris, in December, 2008.

In 2010, Cizik helped create and serves as co-chair of "The Casablanca Institute" to foster interfaith dialogue, build relationships between Evangelical Christians and Muslim leaders, and to seek common ground on the major issues facing both religious constituencies and the planet.  In 2013, the Casablanca Institute was named one of the top ten "Best New Think Tanks" in a global ranking called "Global Go To Think Tank Rankings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gotothinktank.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/2012-Global-Go-To-Think-Tank-Report.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-02-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130228075634/http://www.gotothinktank.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/2012-Global-Go-To-Think-Tank-Report.pdf |archivedate=2013-02-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

===National Association of Evangelicals===
Cizik was a staff member at the NAE from 1980 to 2008.&lt;ref name="CT article" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Duke"&gt;[http://www.nicholas.duke.edu/institute/bio-cizik.html Cizik biography] at the Nicholas Institute for Environmental Policy Solutions' website&lt;/ref&gt;  He described himself in the early years as a "pro-[[George W. Bush|Bush]] [[American conservatism|conservative]]" and generally took conservative positions on issues such as [[gay marriage]], [[abortion]], and [[stem-cell research]].&lt;ref name="Grist" /&gt;  As the organization's primary lobbyist, Cizik was influential in pushing conservative Evangelical-supported legislation at a national level.  However, he began moving more towards the center in the 1990s.&lt;ref name="IRD"&gt;[http://www.theird.org/NETCOMMUNITY/Page.aspx?pid=867&amp;srcid=198 Interview with Richard Cizik], with Terry Gross. ''[[Fresh Air (NPR)|NPR's Fresh Air]], 12/2/2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2004/10/14/christian_lobbying_finds_success/ Christian lobbying finds success], by Farah Stockman, ''[[Boston Globe]]'', October 14, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Reuters"&gt;[http://today.reuters.com/news/articlenews.aspx?type=politicsNews&amp;storyID=2006-09-25T195455Z_01_N20188245_RTRUKOC_0_US-ENVIRONMENT-EVANGELICALS.xml Evangelical Christian lobbyist pushes environment], by Deborah Zabarenko, [[Reuters]], September 25, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

As national spokesman for millions of evangelicals, he has worked successfully with both Democrats and Republicans. In the fall of 2008, however, he began to publicly criticize John McCain ("I thought John McCain was a principled person," "But John McCain...seems to be waffling on issue after issue").&lt;ref name="Smacks McCain"&gt;[http://coloradoindependent.com/8807/evangelical-leader-smacks-mccain-for-lack-of-principle Evangelical leader smacks McCain for lack of ‘principle’], by Cara Degette. Colorado Independent, 9/22/08&lt;/ref&gt; He voted for Barack Obama during the primaries,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB121937082033962551?mod=googlenews_wsj For Some Evangelicals, GOP Ties Are No Longer Binding], by Suzanne Sataline. [[Wall Street Journal]], 8/22/08&lt;/ref&gt; and strongly implied that he had voted for Obama in the general election.&lt;ref name="IRD"/&gt; This, along with statements about abortion and same-sex civil unions, did not represent the NAE's position, and he resigned a week later.&lt;ref name="CT interview" /&gt;

===Environmental activism===
After hearing scientist and fellow Evangelical [[John T. Houghton|John Houghton]] present evidence on [[global warming]] in 2002, Cizik was convinced that environmentalism, and especially climate change, should be a part of the Evangelical political agenda.&lt;ref name="Moyers" /&gt;

Cizik calls this environmentalism "creation care."&lt;ref name="Grist" /&gt;  He differentiates "creation care" from other environmentalism because of the former's roots "not in politics or ideology, but in the scriptures."&lt;ref name="Grist" /&gt;  Cizik cites several [[Bible]] verses to support his position, including [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%202:15;&amp;version=9;; Genesis 2:15] and [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation%2011:18;&amp;version=9; Revelation 11:18].&lt;ref name="Grist" /&gt;

Cizik has been criticized for his global warming advocacy by fellow evangelicals and conservatives.&lt;ref name="Moyers" /&gt;  He has responded to some of these critics by asking whether his critics are possibly being influenced by ties to the conservative movement or oil and gas companies.&lt;ref name="Moyers" /&gt;

Cizik's name appeared as a signatory on an initial draft of the 2006 [[Evangelical Climate Initiative]]'s "Call to Action," but it was absent from the final draft.  In an interview with [[Bill Moyers]], Cizik indicated that pressure from his colleagues at the NAE caused him to remove his name from the statement.&lt;ref name="Moyers"/&gt; In fact the Executive Committee, responding to twenty Evangelical leaders who asked the NAE not to take a stance on global warming,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cornwallalliance.org/docs/appeal-letter-to-the-national-association-of-evangelicals-on-the-issue-of-global-warming.pdf 20 Christian leaders appeal to the NAE], January 2006&lt;/ref&gt; had passed a resolution stating that "global warming is not a consensus issue" and instructing its staff "to stand by and not exceed in any fashion our approved and adopted statements concerning the environment contained within the Evangelical Call to Civic Responsibility."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cornwallalliance.org/articles/read/fact-sheet-evangelicals-should-be-wary-of-the-politicization-and-bad-science-of-global-warming-alarmism/#Resources Cornwall Alliance fact sheet]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/08/national/08warm.htm Evangelical Leaders Join Global Warming Initiative], by Laurie Goodstein, ''[[New York Times]]'', February 8, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; (The 2001 document, ''For the Health of the Nation: An Evangelical Call to Civic Responsibility'', includes a section on "protect[ing] God's creation" but does not mention climate change.&lt;ref name="NAE Civic Responsibility"&gt;''[http://www.nae.net/images/civic_responsibility2.pdf For the Health of the Nation: An Evangelical Call to Civic Responsibility]'', National Association of Evangelicals, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;)

In January 2007, Cizik and [[Eric Chivian]] co-hosted the launch of a collaboration between scientists and Evangelicals, presenting it as a joint project of Harvard Medical School's Center for Health and the Global Environment and the NAE.&lt;ref&gt;[http://chge.med.harvard.edu/media/releases/jan_17.html Media advisory], Harvard Medical School Center for Health and the Global Environment, January 17, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The 28 participants released "An Urgent Call to Action," which presented human-induced climate change as a primary concern and called for prompt public policy solutions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://chge.med.harvard.edu/media/releases/documents/signedstatement.pdf An Urgent Call to Action: Scientists and Evangelicals Unite to Protect Creation], January 17, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Critics of the collaboration pointed out that the NAE had not changed its position on climate change,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cornwallalliance.org/articles/read/contrary-to-media-reports-national-association-of-evangelicals-has-not-endorsed-latest-statement-on-global-warming/ Contrary to Media Reports, National Association of Evangelicals Has Not Endorsed Latest Statement on Global Warming], Cornwall Alliance press release, January 17, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; but in response to a reporter's question Cizik insisted that the NAE board had approved "this dialogue."&lt;ref&gt;[http://chge.med.harvard.edu/media/releases/documents/transcript.pdf#Page=11 Transcript], press conference, January 17, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2007, [[James Dobson]], head of [[Focus on the Family]], and 24 other evangelical leaders signed a letter asking "the NAE board to ensure that Mr. Cizik faithfully represents the policies and commitments of the organization, including its defense of traditional values," and suggesting that Cizik resign "if he cannot be trusted to articulate the views of American evangelicals on environmental issues."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.citizenlink.org/pdfs/NAELetterFinal.pdf Letter to the NAE Board from 25 evangelical leaders]&lt;/ref&gt; A number of other evangelical leaders declined to sign Dobson's letter on the grounds that it was un-Christian.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}  [[Richard Land]] of the [[Southern Baptist Convention]] noted, "I didn't feel that it was the most productive, most redemptive way to address the problem," and [[Leith Anderson]], NAE president, stated that his mail was "overwhelmingly supportive of Rich."  Cizik has responded by saying that "It's time we return to being people known for our love and care of the earth and our fellow human beings."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/17553246/site/newsweek/ "Beliefwatch:Tree Hugger", Newsweek, March 19th, 2007, pg. 13]&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2008, NAE President Leith Anderson reiterated that ''For the Health of the Nation'' contains the NAE's only official position on the environment, and confirmed that "we don't [have a specific position] on global warming or emissions. [Cizik] has spoken as an individual on that."&lt;ref name="CT interview"&gt;[http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2008/decemberweb-only/150-41.0.html Interview: NAE President Leith Anderson on Richard Cizik's Resignation], by Sarah Pulliam, ''[[Christianity Today]]''. Published December 11, 2008. Accessed December 18, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, TIME magazine named Richard Cizik and Eric Chivian to its list of most influential "Thinkers and Scientists" list called the "TIME 100."

In 2012, Rich Cizik became the Chief Spokesperson for the Good Steward Campaign, an ecumenically Christian environmental organization working on college campuses to inform and engage students in conversations about climate change, stewardship, creation care, and fossil fuel divestment. Rich travels up and down the East Coast doing speaking events for the Good Steward Campaign and spoken at schools like the University of Virginia and Eastern Mennonite University. He continues in this role today.

===Gay rights issues===
Cizik supported the passage of [[California Proposition 8 (2008)|Proposition 8]] and recently signed his name to a full-page ad in ''[[The New York Times]]''' accusing the [[Gay Community|gay population]] of "anti-religious bigotry", especially against [[Mormon]]s, and "trying to start a religious war."&lt;ref name="CT article" /&gt; In response, a gay rights group placed another full-page advertisement in ''[[The Salt Lake Tribune]]'' titled "Lies in the name of the Lord" and featuring [[Pinocchio]] carrying a whitewashed "Cizik Version" of the [[Bible]].&lt;ref name="CT article" /&gt;

Cizik made a statement on the [[National Public Radio]] program "Fresh Air" in December 2008 in which he said that he supports same-sex civil unions and is “shifting” on gay marriage.&lt;ref name="CT article"&gt;[http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2008/decemberweb-only/150-42.0.html Richard Cizik Resigns from the National Association of Evangelicals], by Sarah Pullman. ''[[Christianity Today]]''. Published December 11, 2008. Accessed December 11, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;  He also commented that about 4 in 10 young evangelicals have a homosexual, bisexual, or transsexual friend or family member and about 5 in 10 favor either same-sex marriage or civil unions.&lt;ref name=ABC/&gt; Cizik later appeared to shift his position, releasing a statement reading: "I am now and always have been committed to work to pass laws that protect and foster family life, and to work against government attempts to interfere with the integrity of the family, including same-sex 'marriage' and civil unions."&lt;ref name="CT article"/&gt; However, in a return visit to "Fresh Air" in July 2010, Cizik reiterated his support for same-sex civil unions and expressed his ambivalence about same-sex marriage.&lt;ref name="FreshAir28July2010"&gt;[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=128776382 Ousted Evangelical Reflects On Faith, Future ], by Terri Gross. ''[[Fresh Air]]''. Published July 28, 2010. Accessed July 28, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;  His NPR remarks led Cizik to resign from his position with the NAE.&lt;ref name="CT article"/&gt;

Cizik's statements found support by some older evangelicals such as [[Jim Wallis]] and by many younger evangelicals, some of which [[ABC News]] says consider Cizik as a "hero".&lt;ref name=ABC/&gt; In contrast, the NAE stated that Ciziks' positions do not "appropriately represent the values and convictions" of the NAE.&lt;ref name=ABC/&gt; David Brody, [[Christian Broadcasting Network]] correspondent, commented on the divided reaction by saying that "At the end of the day, evangelicals are not going to budge on the life and marriage issues."&lt;ref name=ABC/&gt;

===Abortion and Health Care===

Cizik has described himself as an "advocate for pro-life policies without exception."&lt;ref name="CT article"/&gt; He supports government distribution of [[contraception]].&lt;ref name="CT article"/&gt; He has stated that "younger evangelicals [...] are decidedly pro-life" and that "health care is just as important to younger evangelicals as is abortion."&lt;ref name="CT article"/&gt;  Cizik also conceived and helped draft the definite statement on evangelical support for family planning in 2012 entitled "A Christian Call to Common Ground on Family Planning, Maternal and Children's Health and Abortion Reduction" released at the National Press Club in Washington, D.C. on October 15, 2012.

On December 24, 2012 Newsweek wrote in a piece entitled "Can Safe Sex Save the Earth?" that "If his ouster [National Association of Evangelicals] was meant to silence him, it didn't work."  And that "Cizik has also made the case that access to contraceptives is not only good for people, but also, since it helps curb overpopulation, good for the planet. On his blog, he calls family planning a “green technology.”

'''Runglish''', '''Rusinglish''', '''Ruglish''' or '''Russlish''' ({{lang-ru|русинглиш / рунглиш}}, ''rusinglish'' / ''runglish''), is a Russian–English [[macaronic language]]. 

The term "runglish" was popularized in 2000 as a name for one of the languages aboard the [[International Space Station]]. [[Cosmonaut]] [[Sergei Krikalyov]] said: "We say jokingly that we communicate in 'Runglish,' a mixture of Russian and English languages, so that when we are short of words in one language we can use the other, because all the crew members speak both languages well." NASA has since begun listing Runglish as one of the on-board languages.&lt;ref name="NASA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/station/perspace/profile_crew_1.html|title=The Expedition One Crew|publisher=spaceflight.nasa.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although less widespread than other [[pidgin]]s and [[creole language|creoles]], such as [[Tok Pisin]], Runglish is spoken in a number of English-Russian communities, most notably the Russian-speaking community of [[Brighton Beach]] in [[Brooklyn]], [[New York (state)|New York]].&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E01E3DD133EF937A25755C0A9639C8B63|title=For the Thirsty Runglish Speaker: Try an Ized Cyawfeh|publisher=[[New York Times]]|date=14 June 2005 | first=Alan | last=Feuer | accessdate=23 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In literature==
Some notable novels have foreshadowed the development of Runglish. A small subplot in [[Arthur C. Clarke]]'s novel ''[[2010: Odyssey Two]]'' concerned the crew of a Russo-American spaceship, who attempted to break down boredom with a ''Stamp Out Russlish!!'' campaign. As the story went, both crews were fully fluent in each other's languages, to the point that they found themselves crossing over languages in mid-conversation, or even simply speaking the other language even when there was no-one who had it as their native tongue present. [[Anthony Burgess]]' novel ''[[A Clockwork Orange (novel)|A Clockwork Orange]]'' has a famous form of Runglish called [[Nadsat]]. (See: [[wikt:Concordance:A Clockwork Orange|Concordance: A Clockwork Orange]]) Less famously (but also in science fiction), [[Robert Heinlein]]’s novel ‘’[[The Moon is a Harsh Mistress]]’’ is written in the heavily Russian-influenced English (much Russian vocabulary, some Russian grammar) of a joint Australian/Russian penal colony on the Moon.

==Official resistance==
The Russian government declared 2007 to be the "Year of the Russian Language". It has been claimed that this was in part to give support to what is seen as proper Russian against such influences as the spread of English and Runglish.&lt;ref name="Telegraph"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/1562947/English-invades-Russian-language.html|title=English invades Russian language|publisher=[[Daily Telegraph]]|date= 12 September 2007 | location=London | first=Adrian | last=Blomfield | accessdate=23 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yuri Prokhorov, the head of the Russian State Institute of Foreign Languages, stated that "Young people always develop fashionable ways of communicating. (But) it is Russian words used incorrectly that damages the purity of the language, not the introduction of foreign words."&lt;ref name="Telegraph"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4665">The '''Senate Conservatives Fund''' is a United States [[political action committee]] (PAC) that supports conservative [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] candidates, primarily in the [[United States Senate]], in primary and general elections. The PAC was founded by then-U.S. Senator from South Carolina [[Jim DeMint]] in 2008. It has supported repealing the [[Affordable Care Act]]. Republican leaders have criticized the fund for targeting Senate Republicans.&lt;ref name="Politico"&gt;{{cite news|last=Palmer|first=Anna|title=Senate Conservatives Fund roils GOP|url=http://www.politico.com/story/2013/09/senate-conservatives-fund-roils-gop-97505.html|newspaper=Politico|date=September 29, 2013|author2=Raju, Manu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Joseph|first=Cameron|title=Senate Conservatives Fund launches ads against Democrats on shutdown|url=http://thehill.com/video/campaign/325797-senate-conservatives-fund-launches-ads-against-democrats-on-shutdown|newspaper=The Hill|date=October 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
South Carolina Senator [[Jim DeMint]] founded the Senate Conservatives Fund during the summer of 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Rosen|first=James|title=DeMint goes national in Senate re-election campaign|url=http://www.mcclatchydc.com/2008/06/27/42524/demint-goes-national-in-senate.html|newspaper=McClatchy DC|date=June 27, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fund first supported [[Pat Toomey]] in his challenge against Pennsylvania Senator [[Arlen Specter]], and [[Marco Rubio]] in his challenge to [[Charlie Crist]] in Florida.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lerer|first=Lisa|title=Jim DeMint's Path to Power|url=http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/10_39/b4196031953733.htm#p1|newspaper=Businessweek|date=September 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, the Senate Conservatives Fund raised $9.3 million, supporting successful Senate candidates [[Mike Lee (U.S. politician)|Mike Lee]] of Utah, [[Rand Paul]] of Kentucky, and [[Ron Johnson (Wisconsin politician)|Ron Johnson]] of Wisconsin. The PAC also supported a number of unsuccessful candidates, including [[Sharron Angle]] in Nevada, [[Ken Buck]] in Colorado, [[Joe Miller (Alaska politician)|Joe Miller]] in Alaska, [[John Raese]] in West Virginia, [[Dino Rossi]] in Washington, and [[Christine O'Donnell]] in Delaware.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Overby|first=Peter|title=DeMint Increases Clout By Banking On Conservatives|url=https://www.npr.org/2010/11/12/131271082/demint-increases-clout-by-banking-on-conservatives|newspaper=NPR|date=November 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gonzales|first=Nathan L.|title=Group DeMint Founded Has No Plans to Replace the Departing Senator|url=http://rothenbergpoliticalreport.com/news/article/group-demint-founded-has-no-plans-to-replace-the-departing-senator|publisher=The Rothenberg Political Report|date=December 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The PAC raised and spent $16 million during the 2012 election cycle. After DeMint left office to head up the conservative [[Heritage Foundation]], former DeMint chief of staff and political operative Matt Hoskins became executive director.

The fund has aligned itself with U.S. Senator [[Ted Cruz]] and has levied attacks on Senators [[Mitch McConnell]] and [[Lamar Alexander]]. In 2013, the fund orchestrated a [[robocall]] and direct mail campaign to generate signatures for an anti-Affordable Care Act petition. The PAC also endorsed a strategy to defund Obamacare that culminated in [[United States federal government shutdown of 2013|the 2013 shutdown of the federal government]].&lt;ref name="Politico"/&gt;

===House Conservative Project===
In 2013, the Fund expanded its focus to target House Republicans. Executive Director Hoskins described the impetus for the project as being partially to "build a farm team for the Senate."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Strauss|first=Daniel|title=Powerful Senate Conservatives Fund Expands To Focus On House Races|url=http://talkingpointsmemo.com/dc/powerful-senate-conservatives-fund-expands-to-focus-on-house-races|newspaper=Talking Points Memo|date=September 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Project has endorsed Oklahoma Representative [[Jim Bridenstine]].

The '''September Uprising''' ({{lang-bg|Септемврийско въстание}}, ''Septemvriysko vastanie'') was an armed insurgency staged in September 1923 by the [[Bulgarian Communist Party]] (BCP) under [[Comintern]] pressure, as an attempt to overthrow [[Alexander Tsankov]]'s [[Democratic Alliance (Bulgaria)|new government]] of [[Kingdom of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]] that had come to power with the [[9 June coup d'état|coup d'état of 9 June]]. Besides its [[communism|communist]] base, the uprising was also supported by [[Bulgarian Agrarian National Union|agrarians]] and [[anarchism|anarchists]]. The uprising's goal was the "establishment of a government of workers and peasants" in Bulgaria, not the conversion of the country's socioeconomic system to communism.{{clarify|date=February 2017}}

==Background and organization==
The Bulgarian Communist Party leaders took up a neutral position on the 9 June coup d'état and the subsequent [[Bulgarian coup d'état of 1923|June Uprising]] because it regarded what was happening in the country as "struggle for power between the urban and rural [[bourgeoisie]]". This position was provoked by the belief of the party's older leaders, headed by [[Dimitar Blagoev]] and Todor Lukanov, that there were no ripe conditions for a revolution in Bulgaria yet.

At the same time, a number of party organizations in the country proclaimed their support for counteraction to the coup d'état, with some even joining the June Uprising. Bulgarian Comintern General Secretary [[Vasil Kolarov]] sent a telegram to the [[Bulgarian Communist Party|BCP (Narrow Socialists)]] leadership, advising them to "act in determination, even together with [[Aleksandar Stamboliyski|Stamboliyski]]". However, no common BCP measures in support of the June Uprising were taken in the long run.

In early August 1923, a plenary session of the BCP (Narrow Socialists) Central Committee was called. During the session, the young and radical party activists, headed by [[Georgi Dimitrov]] and Vasil Kolarov, backed by the Comintern, prevailed in support of the organization of a new uprising.

The government took precautions to prevent the uprising, arresting more than 2,000 noted BCP activists on 12 September 1923. As a reaction to the arrests, the uprising broke out without plan in isolated areas, initially around [[Kazanlak]]. On 20 September, a BCP Central Committee meeting was held, during which a decision was reached to proclaim the uprising on the eve of 23 September, despite opposition by the supporters of legal activity. The plan involved a mass uprising around [[Vratsa]] followed by the formation of an organized militia which would capture the capital [[Sofia]].

==Outbreak==
Insurrectionary activity was first started by the communists in the village of [[Maglizh]] near Kazanlak on the eve of 14 September. Their actions were backed by the BCP branch in Golyamo Dryanovo. The rebels seized the two villages, but received no support from the neighbouring branches, which decided to wait until the official proclamation of the uprising. Several hours after the outbreak in Maglizh, they withdrew into the mountains.

On 12 September, a campaign committee was set up in [[Stara Zagora]], which reached a decision that the region should be stirred up to revolt on the eve of 20 September. The uprising broke out in Stara Zagora at the arranged time, but was quickly suppressed by government forces.

[[Nova Zagora]] revolted at the same time, with the city and the whole region being quickly seized by the rebels. The villages around [[Chirpan]] also revolted on the eve of 20 September and an unsuccessful attempt to capture the city was undertaken. The lack of an organized uprising around [[Burgas]] allowed the government to mobilize strong forces and crush the uprising around Stara Zagora. Particularly hard battles were fought at Maglizh, Enina and [[Shipka (town)|Shipka]].

==Uprising in northwestern Bulgaria==
[[Aleksandar Tsankov]]'s government, not enjoying wide popular support but relying on the army, declared [[martial law]] on 22 September and mobilized sizable forces to suppress the uprising. Groups of volunteers organized in ''shpitskomandi'' (paramilitary formations) also fought against the rebels.

In support of the cavalry platoon in [[Lom, Bulgaria|Lom]], which was encircled by the rebels, the government sent relief from [[Vidin]]. The rebel forces were aided by one cannon operated by Father Andrey, but it failed to tip the balance in their advantage. After three days of small-scale [[urban warfare]], the government restored control over Lom.

At the morning of 25 September, rebels under Gavril Genov attacked the government troops heading to [[Montana, Bulgaria|Ferdinand]] at [[Boychinovtsi]] and defeated them following a bitter fight. The victory raised their morale and they advanced to Vratsa, but were driven back. Rebel forces were also routed at [[Brusartsi]] by troops garrisoned at Vidin. The resistance of the rebels in the [[Petrohan Pass]] was also broken around the same time, and numerous heavily armed military units advanced to Ferdinand and [[Berkovitsa]]. In order to save the rebels from total extermination, the leaders issued an order to retreat to [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]]. On 27 September, the government forces entered Ferdinand. On 28 September and 29 September, there were only occasional fights between the retreating rebels and the army.

==Uprising elsewhere==
In [[Plovdiv]] and the vicinity, an uprising practically did not break out. Only a handful of villages revolted around [[Pazardzhik]], among which [[Muhovo, Sofia Province|Muhovo]] and [[Lesichevo]]. On 24 September, the rebels attempted an unsuccessful attack of [[Septemvri|Saranbey]].

Following the departure of Dimitrov and Kolarov for the northwest, there were no preparations for the uprising in Sofia. The reason was that the Sofia branch of the BCP was dominated by supporters of legal action against Tsankov's government. Ultimately, a revolutionary committee was set up, consisting of Anton Ivanov, Dimitar Ginchev and Todor Atanasov, but it was uncovered and its members were arrested as early as 21 September. The lack of an uprising in Sofia allowed the government to use its best military units from Sofia to crush the uprising in other parts of the country.

There was small-scale insurrection around [[Ihtiman]] and [[Samokov]], as well as in individual villages in the vicinity of Sofia and [[Pirdop]]. Ihtiman and [[Kostenets]] were captured, but the rebels were quickly crushed by government detachments from Sofia.

Before the beginning of the uprising, BCP and the [[Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization]] (IMRO) concluded an agreement, according to which BCP would not stir up the population in [[Blagoevgrad Province|Pirin]] whereas IMRO would not obstruct the uprising's organization in other parts of the country. In practice, however, neither side respected the agreement, as the area around [[Razlog]] revolted and IMRO joined the conflict on the side of the government. Following short fights, the rebels withdrew into the mountains.

Individual villages around [[Veliko Tarnovo]], [[Shumen]] and Burgas also joined the uprising.

==Consequences==
[[Image:Septemvri1923arestuvani.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Arrested rebels in [[Vratsa]]]]
Following the suppression, the government, ''shpitskomandi'' and IMRO detachments committed atrocities against the civil population in the regions that revolted, with particularly large atrocities around the town of Ferdinand. Active communists and agrarians were killed, including some which did not take part in the September Uprising. According to a book published for the limited use of the [[nomenklatura]] by the [[Bulgarian Communist Party|BCP]] in 1972,entitled "Stars in the Centuries" the total number of casualties is 841&lt;ref&gt;'''Музей на революционното движение в България''', ''Звезди във вековете'', Издателство на Българската комунистическа партия, София, 1972, 791 стр. &lt;/ref&gt;,this is mostly in line with researches made after the fall of the Communist regime.Historiography during the [[History of the People's Republic of Bulgaria|communist rule of Bulgaria]] often considerably exaggerated the figures with political purposes. 

After the crushing of the uprising, its leaders Georgi Dimitrov and Vasil Kolarov fled to Yugoslavia and then to the [[Soviet Union]]. Some of the rebels remained in the country and acted as isolated militia in the mountains, other emigrated to Yugoslavia.

In the Bulgarian communist historiography, Tsankov's government was regarded [[fascist]] and the September Uprising was called "the first [[anti-fascist]] uprising".  

==In art==
[[Image:Septemvri1923Pazardjik.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Communist-era memorial of the September Uprising in [[Pazardzhik]]]]
The September Uprising and the atrocities during its suppression provoked a powerful reaction among the Bulgarian intellectuals of the time. Among the more famous works dedicated to the uprising are the poem ''Septemvri'' by [[Geo Milev]], the novel ''Horo'' by [[Anton Strashimirov]] and the painting ''Septemvri 1923'' by [[Ivan Milev]]. Others include the books of poetry ''Proleten vyatar'' (''Spring Wind'') by [[Nikola Furnadzhiev]] and ''Zhertveni kladi'' (''Sacrificial Stakes'') by Asen Raztsvetnikov. The latter, together with [[Angel Karaliychev]], author of the book ''Razh'' (''Rye''), were later classed as the "September generation of writers".

Between 1944 and 1979, memorials of the uprising were erected in a number of places, the locals of which participated in it.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9176">'''''Testem benevolentiae nostrae''''' is a [[Ecclesiastical_letter#Letters_of_the_Popes_in_modern_times|letter]] written by [[Pope Leo XIII]] to Cardinal [[James Gibbons]], [[Archbishop of Baltimore]]", dated January 22, 1899. In it, the pope addressed a heresy he called [[Americanism (heresy)|Americanism]], and expressed his concern that the American Church should guard against American values of [[liberalism]] and [[Religious pluralism|pluralism]] undermining the doctrine of the Church.

== Background ==
[[File:Leo XIII.jpg|thumb|right|Pope Leo XIII]]

''Testem benevolentiae nostrae'' translates as "Witness to Our Good Will." The Pope was concerned about the culture of Catholics in the United States, in respone to the preface of the [[French language|French]] [[translation]] of the biography of [[Isaac Thomas Hecker]].&lt;ref name=Pallen&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14537a.htm Pallen, Condé. "Testem Benevolentiae." The Catholic Encyclopedia] Vol. 14. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1912. 7 November 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Hecker's biography reached [[France]] eleven years after Father Hecker had died (in good standing with the Church), and its French translation included a liberal preface by Abbé Félix Klein. Leo proposed to review certain opinions expressed by the translator in the book about Isaac Hecker.&lt;ref name=Pallen/&gt; In particular: The Church should adapt to the new advanced civilization and relax her disciplines regarding not only the rule of life but also the deposit of faith, passing-over or minimizing certain points of doctrine, or giving to them a new meaning which the Church had never held.&lt;ref name=Pallen/&gt;

== Substance ==

===Rejection of American particularism===
''Testem benevolentiae nostrae'' involved American [[Multicultural particularism|particularism]] and view of individual [[liberty]]. On particularism it was believed that a movement of American Catholics felt they were a special case who needed greater latitude in order to assimilate into a majority [[Protestant]] nation. The letter rejected the idea of "some who conceive and would have the Church in America to be different from what it is in the rest of the world.&lt;ref name=testem&gt;[http://www.papalencyclicals.net/Leo13/l13teste.htm Pope Leo XIII. ''Testem benevolentiae nostrae'', 22 January 1899]&lt;/ref&gt; (In 1892, certain immigrant support associations, while advocating for the establishment of national parishes in order that the congregations could be served by priests who understood the language and culture, pressed for the appointment of bishops to reflect representation of each nationality. This caused considerable disturbance among the American hierarchy.) The letter reiterated that Catholic teaching was the same throughout the world and not to be adjusted to suit a particular area.

During the 19th century, Catholic doctrine articulated that Protestantism was a [[heresy]] and even a harmful [[new religious movement]], although the Church under Leo did indicate individual Protestants might well be innocent due to "[[Invincible ignorance (Catholic theology)|invincible ignorance]]". Still, Protestant religions themselves were not to be learned from or accepted as equals. Outside of this issue the article gave the consolation that Catholicism could accommodate to American norms when they did not conflict with doctrinal or moral teachings of the [[Catholic Church]].

The letter actually had more to do with Catholics in [[France]] than those in the United States. French conservatives were appalled at Abbé Klein's remarks in a book about an American priest, and claimed that a number of the American Catholic clergy shared these views.&lt;ref name=Kelly&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=c1gYFMsR0YgC&amp;pg=PA210&amp;dq=testem+benevolentiae+nostrae&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiXntrozqzJAhWIOhoKHdQ_A6Y4FBDoAQhNMAc#v=onepage&amp;q=testem%20benevolentiae%20nostrae&amp;f=false Kelly, Joseph Francis. ''History and Heresy'', Liturgical Press, 2012] {{ISBN|9780814656952}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, in many ways, the article was more a warning to France that its Republic was becoming too [[liberalism|liberal]] or [[secularist]].

He expresses concern lest Americans would value their freedom and [[individualism]] so much they would reject the idea of [[monasteries]] and the [[priesthood]]. "Did not your country, the United States, derive the beginnings both of faith and of culture from the children of these religious families?"&lt;ref name=testem/&gt; Again this is more about the [[anticlericalism]] in France at the time.

It was not uncommon for American bishops, finding themselves having to provide education and health care to large numbers of immigrants, pointedly solicited congregations involved in those activities. Leo cautioned against valuing an active apostolate more than a contemplative one. "Nor should any difference of praise be made between those who follow the active state of life and those others who, charmed with solitude, give themselves to prayer and bodily mortification."&lt;ref name=testem/&gt;

===Negative view of freedom of the press===
In November 1892 at a meeting of the archbishops held in New York City, Bishop Francesco Satolli, soon to be the first Apostolic delegate to the United States, presented fourteen propositions regarding the solution of certain school problems which had been for some time under discussion. The draft propositions were "inopportunely" published, with incorrect interpretations and malign insinuations in some papers, causing a good deal of "acrid" discussion.&lt;ref name=parsons&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=OelHAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA337&amp;dq=testem+benevolentiae+nostrae&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj0lNCI36zJAhXIOz4KHQ9xBIQ4KBDoAQg1MAM#v=onepage&amp;q=testem%20benevolentiae%20nostrae&amp;f=false Parsons, Reuben. "Leo XII and the Church in the United States", ''Studies in Church History'', Century XIX, Pt. II, J.J. McVey, 1900]&lt;/ref&gt;

''Testem benevolentiae nostrae'' clearly rejects full [[freedom of the press]].&lt;blockquote&gt;"These dangers, viz., the confounding of license with liberty, the passion for discussing and pouring contempt upon any possible subject, the assumed right to hold whatever opinions one pleases upon any subject and to set them forth in print to the world, have so wrapped minds in darkness that there is now a greater need of the Church's teaching office than ever before, lest people become unmindful both of conscience and of duty."&lt;ref name=testem/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; Defenders of the document believe criticizing press freedom was understandable in an age of increasing libel, slander, and incitements of violence in newspapers. Newspaper stories of convents had already inflamed anti-Catholic violence. Further the [[Spanish–American War]], which many Catholics opposed, was often blamed on [[William Randolph Hearst]]'s newspapers and had occurred a year before the letter. Opponents of ''Testem benevolentiae nostrae'' believe it displayed an ongoing Vatican opposition to [[democracy]] and progress.

Still, both sides tend to agree that Leo XIII wrote in a less condemnatory or at least more tactful manner than most of his immediate predecessors. Critics state this is merely because his immediate predecessors were or became strident reactionaries like [[Pope Pius IX]]. Supporters cite the fact that his encyclical on [[Americanism (heresy)|Americanism]], "Longinqua", spoke of love for America more than condemnation of it.

==Legacy and influence==

The legacy of ''Testem benevolentiae nostrae'' is disputed. Among [[Traditionalist Catholics]] today there remains widespread support for its statements against [[ecumenical]]ism and [[liberalism]]. In more liberal circles, however, scholars maintain that it largely destroyed Catholic intellectual life in the US for the first half of the twentieth century. And yet, many others hold that its importance has been exaggerated. It does, however, highlight the uneasy relationship between the [[Holy See]] and the United States, a country which did not give full diplomatic relations with the Holy See until the presidency of [[Ronald Reagan]] in the 1980s.

Some historians believe the letter was really directed at liberal currents in France.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=lBHNAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA240&amp;dq=testem+benevolentiae+nostrae&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiksqHbx6zJAhWLdT4KHSBMACo4ChDoAQhPMAc#v=onepage&amp;q=testem%20benevolentiae%20nostrae&amp;f=false Allen, Jr., John L., ''The Catholic Church'', Oxford University Press, 2014] {{ISBN|9780199379811}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Farm''' is an [[intentional community]] in [[Lewis County, Tennessee]], near the town of [[Summertown, Tennessee|Summertown]], [[Tennessee]],&lt;ref&gt;Michael Gavin, [https://web.archive.org/web/20070930165354/http://tennesseeencyclopedia.net/imagegallery.php?EntryID=T082 The Farm] in ''The Tennessee Encyclopedia of History and Culture'',&lt;/ref&gt; based on principles of [[nonviolence]] and respect for the [[Earth]]. It was founded in 1971 by [[Stephen Gaskin]], and 300 spiritual seekers from Haight Ashbury and San Francisco. The Farm is well known among hippies and members of the [[counterculture]] and around the world as the home of modern [[midwifery]]. It is widely respected for its many [[nonprofit]]s, including [[Plenty International]], a relief and development organization, and Swan Conservation Trust, who established the {{convert|1358|acre}} Big Swan Headwaters Preserve.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Big Swan Headwaters conserved for future generations|url=http://www.heraldchronicle.com/big-swan-headwaters-conserved-for-future-generations/|accessdate=3 June 2017|work=Herald Chronicle|publisher=Lakeway Publishers, Inc.|date=31 May 2017|location=Summertown, TN|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Farm has approximately 200 members and residents.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/03/us/stephen-gaskin-hippie-who-founded-an-enduring-commune-dies-at-79.html|title=Stephen Gaskin, Hippie Who Founded an Enduring Commune, Dies at 79|first=Douglas|last=Martin|date=2 July 2014|publisher=|accessdate=25 March 2018|via=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
The Farm was established after Stephen Gaskin and friends led a caravan of 60 buses, vans, and trucks from San Francisco on a four-month speaking tour across the US. Along the way, they became a community, lacking only in land to put down roots.  After returning to California, the decision was made to buy land together. Combining all their resources would finance purchase of only about fifty acres in California.  Another month on the road brought the group back to Tennessee, where they checked out various places that might be suitable to settle.  They decided on property in Lewis County, about seventy miles south of Nashville.&lt;ref&gt;Meunier, Rachel (1994) [https://web.archive.org/web/19981205162804/http://www.thefarm.org/lifestyle/cmnl.html Communal Living in the Late 60s and Early 70s]. Human Issues Project. Archived version retrieved on 24 April 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;  After buying 1,064 acres (4.1&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) for $70 per acre, the group began building its community in the woods alongside the network of crude logging roads that followed its ridgelines.  Shortly thereafter, an adjoining 750 acres (3.0&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) were purchased for $100 per acre.

From its founding in the 1970s, Farm members took [[Simple living|vows of poverty]] and owned no personal possessions other than clothing and tools, though this restriction loosened as time passed. During that time, Farm members did not use artificial [[birth control]], [[alcohol]], [[tobacco]], man-made psychotropics,&lt;ref name="wholeearth"&gt;Kevin Kelly, "[http://kk.org/mt-files/writings/why_we_left_the_farm.pdf Why We Left The Farm]." Interviews with eight founding members describing the origins of the Farm, and how an influx of mentally ill residents and expectant couples, lack of utilities, money mismanagement and Gaskin's disconnect caused the near collapse of the project. ''Whole Earth Review'', Winter 1985.&lt;/ref&gt; or animal products. Many of the early buildings on the Farm were unconventional, ranging from converted school buses to modified 16 x 32 army tents. Over time, larger homes were constructed, each providing shelter for multiple families and single people, often with up to 40 people under one roof. Visitors were also housed in a two-story tent made by sewing two army tents together.

In the early days, Gaskin was considered the "abbot of the monastery" and made many of the governmental decisions for the group. His role was eventually taken over by a "council of elders" and then a "board of directors" consisting of some of the most respected and influential members of the Farm community. The Farm formed a non-profit corporation called The Foundation to provide a common financial structure for the community and members contributed their incomes to it. A security crew constantly maintained a welcome center at the entrance gate where all traffic passed and was logged.

In the original manifestation of The Farm, all members were believers in the holiness of life and that smoking [[marijuana]] was a sacrament. Founding members had all used LSD numerous times and believed they had experienced shared psychedelic vision that bound them together. They said that their cultural conditioning had been blown away enough to experience a world of higher consciousness. They believed in the reality of a spiritual dimension and in universal brotherhood.&lt;ref name="wholeearth"/&gt;

The Farm community ate what might today be called a [[vegan]] diet. In the introduction of 1978 edition of ''The Farm Vegetarian Cookbook'' it states, "We are completely vegetarian. We eat no meat, fish, poultry, eggs, or any kind of animal dairy products. Our diet is based on the soybean, which we eat in many different forms, along with other legumes, grains, fruits and vegetables. We grow our own food and recommend it whenever possible." The book is described as the "family cookbook" of the 1,100 residents living on 1,750 acres in southern [[middle Tennessee]]. The rationale for the diet is stated thus: "We are vegetarians because one-third of the world is starving and at least half goes to bed hungry every night. If everyone was vegetarian, there would be enough food to go around, and no one would be hungry."&lt;ref name="farmvegcookbook"/&gt;

Gaskin, who had served in the [[United States Marine Corps]], got his start as a religious leader in San Francisco in the 1960s, coming to teach a blend of Eastern religions and Christianity.  Due to his devotion to marijuana, he and three followers spent time in 1974 in the Tennessee State Penitentiary in [[Nashville]] following convictions for growing marijuana on Farm land.&lt;ref name=Harrowsmith&gt;{{cite news|title=How They Keep Them Down On The Farm|work=Harrowsmith, Reprint|issue=May/June 1977|publisher=New York Times|date=1 May 1977}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Community evolution==

===Early growth pains===
The Farm's outreach, combined with notoriety through popular media articles, led to a population boom that eventually peaked at around 1600 members living on the main property. Additionally, some ''satellite farm'' affinity communities which were located in the U.S. and other countries consolidated by moving to the Tennessee community. Signs started to appear between 1975 and 1979 that the Tennessee community's weak infrastructure and low income was insufficiently developed to support such a continuously large influx of new members, most of whom did not contribute substantially. The Foundation went increasingly into debt. Members were expected to turn over all money to the collective. Some donated inherited wealth or investment income, but most of it went for the group's Third World projects, or for immediate needs such as food and clothing, rather than planned improvements to the property. Occasionally Gaskin would request a large sum to fund his traveling expenses, which included touring around the world. [[Putting-out system#Cottage industry|Cottage industries]] including [[Sweet sorghum|sorghum molasses]], a publishing company and natural food did not generate sufficient income. Former members also blame the community's sincere attempt to put into practice idealistic concepts they had envisioned while taking LSD, along with youthful overconfidence and misguided belief in Gaskin's ideals.&lt;ref name="wholeearth"/&gt;

Furthering the Farm's growing pains was a [[baby boom]] resulting from the large number of young adults of childbearing age combined with an enthusiastic family philosophy being put into practice. [[Ina May Gaskin]] and other resident midwives advertised their services in the national underground press, which led to numerous couples and their infants moving in without contributing. A small number of infants were adopted by Farm members after the midwives offered to accept, deliver, and keep a woman's baby as an alternative to [[abortion]]. Most mothers kept their baby after the child was born or came back for them not long after.

Gaskin insisted that anyone who wished to partake of Farm life should be allowed to try, even those who were seriously mentally ill, believing the experience would be therapeutic. These proved to be a huge drain on the patience and energy of the residents. Lack of electricity and insufficient capacity of sewage infrastructure resources led to some [[giardia]] outbreaks and malcontent. Gaskin discouraged expressions of discontent and doubt, so that it was impossible to question the established order or propose improvements. As the Farm's population peaked, a disproportionately higher number of children or less-skilled residents could not significantly contribute to the community's economic needs. Gaskin, who was often traveling, may not have been aware of the seriousness of these deprivations, or believed they would improve if members persevered.&lt;ref name="wholeearth"/&gt;&lt;ref name=TwiightOfHippiedom&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lattin|first1=Don|title=Twilight of hippiedom / Farm commune's founder envisions return to the fold as ex-dropouts age|url=http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Twilight-of-hippiedom-Farm-commune-s-founder-2666839.php|accessdate=7 December 2014|work=San Francisco Chronicle, Newspaper|agency=SFGate|issue=Morning|publisher=The San Francisco Chronicle|date=2 March 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Changeover===
In 1983, due to financial difficulties and also a challenge to Stephen Gaskin's leadership and direction, The Farm changed its residential community agreement and began requiring members to support themselves with their own income rather than to donate all income to The Foundation central corporation.&lt;ref name=TwiightOfHippiedom /&gt; This decollectivization was called ''the Changeover''.&lt;ref name=TwiightOfHippiedom /&gt; Many people left disillusioned. The surrounding local rural area provided few possibilities for outside employment. The nearest large city, [[Nashville]], was a 1.5-hour drive {{convert|75|mi|km}} away. Those who could not adapt to the new dynamics of The Changeover found it difficult to remain. Those who had forged independent business opportunities or had reduced overhead could afford to stay.

===Recovery===
Eventually the population settled back down to fewer than 200 adults and children. Those who continued living in the community were buoyed by its freedom and peaceful atmosphere, and the safety and security it provided for their children.&lt;ref name=TwiightOfHippiedom /&gt; The $400,000 plus debt was paid off after several years and the community became debt-free. An entrepreneurial spirit took hold, and numerous small businesses were established to provide support for the residents. Many members went back to school to get degrees in the medical field, and many now work at clinics and hospitals throughout [[Middle Tennessee]].

In the 1990s, with the community back on solid ground, The Farm returned to its original purpose of initiating [[social change]] through outreach and example. The [[Ecovillage]] Training Center was established as an educational facility in new technologies such as [[solar energy]], [[bio fuel]]s, and construction techniques based on locally available, eco-friendly materials.

===Recent status===
The Farm's population is approximately 200;&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt; residents are mostly baby boomers (about 70%), many of whom have lived on The Farm for most of its existence. Those interested in becoming residents are encouraged to visit during the bi-annual Farm Experience Weekend, which provides a glimpse into how the community operates and functions.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

In 2004, the Wholeo Dome (a [[geodesic dome]] fourteen feet in diameter and seven feet tall, covered with curved stained glass panels) was installed at The Farm.&lt;ref name="wholeo.net"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wholeo.net/wholeodome.htm|title=Wholeo Dome|website=www.wholeo.net|accessdate=25 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was created in 1974 by artist Caroling Geary.&lt;ref name="wholeo.net"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hippiemuseum.org/wholeoonline.html|title=hippiemuseum.org&amp;nbsp;-&amp;nbsp;This website is for sale!&amp;nbsp;-&amp;nbsp;hippiemuseum Resources and Information.|website=www.hippiemuseum.org|accessdate=25 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2010 repairs were completed on the Wholeo Dome, but is currently in storage due to issues with the lead in stained glass artwork.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wholeo.net/Trips/Wholeo/GlassDome/location/images/whDome2010.htm|title=Wholeo Dome 2010|website=www.wholeo.net|accessdate=25 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Farm maintains contact with some of its 4000-plus former members through email lists, social media forums, an annual reunion each summer, and through the work of its nonprofit organizations.&lt;ref name=TwiightOfHippiedom /&gt; Former members have gone on to become leaders in many different fields and endeavors, maintaining a sense of [[right livelihood]] and a commitment to the betterment of the world.

==Social and family issues==
Stephen Gaskin believed that marriage was a [[sacrament|sacred act]] and that the sexuality between two people was created by the flow of [[Energy (esotericism)|cosmic energy]], which was known as "the juice".  "For a community to exist in harmony and balance, both kinds of energy had to be nurtured, and most importantly shared."&lt;ref&gt;(Kern, 1993)&lt;/ref&gt; The ideology of marriage at the Farm could be described as "[[synergistic]]".  Seriousness and commitment were required in marriage. With the exception of the Rhythm Method, in the early years [[birth control]] was frowned upon, and [[abortion]]s were prohibited in the community. As an alternative to abortion, the Farm publicly offered to deliver any baby for free and then to find a loving family to raise the child. If the birth mother ever wanted the child she could have it back, and ultimately most kept their baby. Childbearing was natural, and births were attended by midwives. [[Premarital sex]] was greatly discouraged, and most couples on the Farm were married.{{Citation needed|date=February 2015}}

Some of the original community members believed in the practice of [[group marriage]]. The "four marriage system" was viewed as an important social structure in the early days of the commune.  It was taught only people with great ability and "the juice" were in plural marriages. None of these marriages survived more than ten years, most lasted no longer than five.  And in some instances, the couples switched partners when the "four marriage" ended.{{Citation needed|date=February 2015}}

==Projects==
The Farm had its own electrical crew, [[composting]] crew, farming crew, communications, construction &amp; demolition crew, clinic, firewood crew, alternative energy crew, motor pool, laundromat, [[tofu]] plant, bakery, school and [[ambulance]] service. It established The Book Publishing Company, which published the works of the Gaskins and other Farm members. The Farm's midwifery school and [[Ina May Gaskin]]'s seminal book ''[[Spiritual Midwifery]]'' are well known throughout the world for their emphasis on maternal and newborn compassion, safety and success rates.

They also ran a "soy dairy", which developed and later marketed a soymilk ice "cream" called "Ice-Bean", and a vegetable store in the town of Summertown.

===Tennessee Farm Band===
They maintained The Farm Band, a rock group in the early 'jam band' style, which toured the country performing for free at parks, schools, churches, and other accessible venues.
Albums from the 1970s include ''The Farm Band'' on Mantra Records, and ''Up in Your Thing'', ''High On the Rim of the Nashville Basin'' and ''Communion'' on Farm Tapes &amp; Records. There were also a number of 45 releases. All Farm Band recordings were self-produced and distributed. During the 2000s (decade), Akarma Records in Italy have distributed bootleg copies of their albums. In addition to the rock music recordings, Stephen Gaskin released a spoken word album titled the ''Great Western Tour'' in 1974, which was produced and distributed in the same way as their other LPs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lundborg|first1=Patrick|title=The Acid Archives}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Nuclear Regulatory Commission===
Another music project of The Farm was the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (also known as "NRC"), a [[New wave music]] band. They released a 7-inch EP, ''We Are the NRC'', and an album, ''Reactor'', in 1980, and a second 7-inch EP, ''Sally's All Alone (After the End)'', in 1982.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/artist/4822656-The-Nuclear-Regulatory-Commission|title=The Nuclear Regulatory Commission|website=Discogs|accessdate=25 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Plenty===
{{Main|Plenty International}}
[[Image:Plenty International.jpg|thumb|Plenty International]]In 1974, after helping local neighbors after a tornado, the Farm formed Plenty (later, Plenty International), its charitable works arm. It began by gathering and supplying food for local disaster victims and holding weekly "quilting bees" to make blankets for them.

Plenty's most notable early project was its four-year presence in the [[Guatemala]]n highlands after the [[1976 Guatemala earthquake|earthquake of 1976]], helping to rebuild 1,200 houses and lay 27 kilometers of waterpipe. There, it established a micro-[[commune (intentional community)|commune]] of volunteers and their families, living simply among [[Maya peoples|Mayan]] populations and working under the approval of [[History of Guatemala|the military government]].

In 1980, Plenty was the recipient of the first [[Right Livelihood Award]], an alternative to the Nobel prize, also based in Sweden.

Plenty donated an ambulance in the early 1980s to the [[Akwasasne|Akwesasne Mohawk Reservation]] in [[upstate New York]]. Two Farmies &amp;ndash; one a paramedic and one an EMT &amp;ndash; taught a licensed [[Emergency Medical Technician]] course to 22 reservation residents, helping them set up their first Mohawk-run EMT service, the "Mohawk Council of Akwesasne Ambulance Unit". Plenty has set up clinics in [[Lesotho]] and [[Mexico]] and created the [[Jefferson Award]]-winning [[South Bronx, New York|South Bronx]] Ambulance Project in [[New York City]].

Plenty maintains an office in [[Belize]], [[Central America]], which initiated a [[school lunch]] program based on [[organic gardening|organic gardens]] planted next to each school to help provide more vegetables for the children's diets. A midwifery program helped train over 60 Mayan women from villages throughout the region in [[prenatal care]] and safe delivery techniques.

Plenty was one of the first [[relief organization]]s to enter [[New Orleans]], getting past federal roadblocks to bring supplies to survivors just three days after [[Hurricane Katrina]]. Plenty helped establish a [[base camp]] for volunteers and channeled funding to [[Common Ground Collective]], a local group assisting in cleanup, legal defense services, and the operation of free clinics. Plenty volunteers purchased and restored a home in the area to serve as a headquarters for housing relief volunteers and construction crews helping to rebuild homes.

===Book Publishing Company===
Some of the early titles produced by the Book Publishing Company illustrated the early interests of the Farm community; volumes included ''The Farm Vegetarian Cookbook'' (ed. [[Louise Hagler]], 1975), ''Volume One: Sunday Morning Services on the Farm'' by Stephen Gaskin, ''...this season's people'' by Stephen Gaskin, ''Spiritual Midwifery'' by Ina May Gaskin, ''A Cooperative Method of Natural Birth'' by [[Margaret Nofziger]], ''The Big Dummy's Guide to C.B. Radio'' by Albert Houston and the Radio Crew, and ''Shutdown: Nuclear Power on Trial'', by [[John Gofman]] and [[Ernest Sternglass]].&lt;ref name="farmvegcookbook"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Farm Vegetarian Cookbook|year=1978|edition=revised|editor=Hagler, Louise|publisher=The Book Publishing Company|location=Summertown, Tenn.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Book Publishing Company publishes under the imprints Healthy Living, GroundSwell Books, Native Voices, 7th Generation, and Books Alive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bookpubco.com/about-bpc|title=About BPC|first=|last=salvadore|date=3 November 2016|website=www.bookpubco.com|accessdate=25 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technology==

===Infrastructure===
There was no [[Infrastructure|infrastructure grid]] on The Farm's land when it was first settled by the nascent community. Originally relying on antique kerosene lanterns and manual message runners, The Farm grew rapidly to adopt [[appropriate technology]] for electricity, communications, medical, mass media, education, and entertainment. Some of the early residents of The Farm brought their skills as engineers and technicians with them; they took on a multi-year development to build The Farm's novel network of communications and electrical supply.&lt;ref name=LifeboatsMemoir&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bates|first1=Albert|authorlink=Albert Bates|title=Lifeboats: A Memoir|url=http://www.mariposagroup.org/thefarm.htm|website=MariposaGroup|publisher=MariposaGroup|accessdate=7 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially, a single landline or party line shared with several of their Tennessee neighbors was available for outside telephone calls, with a waiting list for any calls. Spurred mainly by the need for prompt childbirth assistance and emergency medical response, a field-phone style party line system was installed by The Farm's telephone crew in 1971. Telephone lines were expanded to widely cover even the most remote areas over the following year. Instead of common telephone bell ringers, the first telephones used Morse Code beeps to signal a call.&lt;ref name="LifeboatsMemoir" /&gt; The party line, affectionately known as ''Beatnik Bell'', was eventually enabled in 1974 to route calls via a manual operator interconnect link patch to the outside line. Later, a 500 line [[Kellogg Switchboard &amp; Supply Company|Kellogg-ITT Relaymatic]] rotary dial phone system was installed in PBX configuration, with multiple outside trunk lines gated through a plug-style manual switchboard operator.&lt;ref name=TelephoneArchive&gt;{{cite web|last1=Massey|first1=David|title=A History of the Kellogg Switchboard &amp; Supply Company|url=http://pdfs.telephonearchive.com/kelloggtelephone/assets/misc_PDF/KG_HISTORY.pdf|website=Telephone Archive|publisher=Telephone Archive|accessdate=7 December 2014|location=Chicago, Illinois, USA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Basic [[Cable television|community CATV]] cables were later run to some areas along the telephone line paths.

The Farm installed its own water system and water towers. Some individuals initially resisted running [[Mains electricity|electricity]] and power lines beyond the administration office and publishing center, with the hope of establishing off-grid decentralized utilities instead. The electrical supply [[Mains electricity|120/240 VAC mains]] system evolved from supplying only a few industrial buildings near the main Farm Road in 1971 to the point by the 1980s where most areas were covered by [[Automotive battery|12 Volt automotive battery]] trickle charge systems.&lt;ref name="LifeboatsMemoir" /&gt; Most homes phased out the use of kerosene lamps by 1975, as they converted to [[Automotive battery|12 Volt lighting]] and RV appliances or re-purposed automotive lighting fixtures. Off-grid low voltage 12 Volt DC systems were also sometimes powered by swapping vehicle batteries. After the economic change in 1983, all home were connected to the standard electrical grid.

===Wireless communications===
The first use of wireless communications on The Farm was in 1971, when a [[Amateur radio|ham radio]] [[High frequency|HF]] [[Single-sideband modulation|SSB]] system was set up. Ham radio was used for health and welfare regional communications between mobile ham operators who were on the road with The Farm Band. The Farm Net, as the ham radio network was known, evolved into a worldwide daily operations schedule on 21332&amp;nbsp;kHz and 21442&amp;nbsp;kHz [[Sideband|Upper Sideband]] in the [[15-meter band]], and a regional schedule on the [[40-meter band|40-meter ham band]].&lt;ref name=Farm_Ham_Radio_Mother_Earth_News_1974&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Macdonald|first1=Copthorne|title=Using Ham Radio, License Tips and Teleprinters, Using Ham Radio on The Farm|date=1 July 1974|publisher= [[Ogden Publications]]|work=[[Mother Earth News]]|location=Kansas, USA|edition=July/August 1974|url=http://www.motherearthnews.com/nature-and-environment/teleprinters-zmaz74jazhol.aspx|accessdate=7 December 2014|ref=NewDirections}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the network's peak in 1978, The Farm Net included over 40 ham radio operators on associated and affinity communities, as well as many HF SSB mobiles. From its main base station, The Farm Net expanded to cover HF SSB communication links to stations in North America, Africa, and Europe using a field of tall radio towers on The Farm's ridgetop. Ham radio operators from The Farm volunteered with the Plenty International disaster relief operations for the [[1976 Guatemala earthquake]], with the [[Greenpeace]] anti-whaling campaigns, and many humanitarian response efforts worldwide. Ham radio was invaluable for voice communications consultations between doctors and field medical teams, and it included the use of HF slow scan TV for the relatively new concept of [[telemedicine]].&lt;ref name=NewDirectionsRadio&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Macdonald|first1=Copthorne|title=Human Unity Conference, Ham Radio Networks, and Other Amateur Radio Initiatives|date=1 May 1981|publisher= [[Ogden Publications]]|work=[[Mother Earth News]]|location=Topeka, Kansas, USA|edition=May/June 1981|url=http://www.motherearthnews.com/nature-and-environment/human-unity-ham-radio-networks-zmaz81mjzraw.aspx|accessdate=7 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ham radio was also used for technical discussions about alternative sources of energy, a popular topic among the back-to-the-land-movement, especially during the time of the [[1970s energy crisis]]. The Farm's ham radio operators also used [[Citizens band radio|CB radios]], as the cost of [[Citizens band radio|CB transceivers]] had dropped impressively during the mid-1970s.&lt;ref name="LifeboatsMemoir" /&gt; CB radios were widely adopted by The Farm for mobile general purpose local communications during this time, while CB radio was starting to become a nationwide craze.&lt;ref name="LifeboatsMemoir" /&gt; This eventually led to the writing of the book ''The Big Dummy's Guide to CB Radio'',&lt;ref name=The_Big_Dummys_Guide_To_CB_Radio&gt;{{cite book|last1=Houston|title=The Big Dummy's Guide To CB Radio|date=1976|publisher=The Book Publishing Company|location=Summertown, Tenn.|isbn=0913990043|pages=128|edition=1st|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; which became a non-fiction bestseller. The popularity and sales of ''The Big Dummy's Guide To CB Radio'' fueled the launch of the Book Publishing Company's new printing presses, and provided much-needed income for The Farm at a crucial time in its growth.&lt;ref name=The_Big_Dummys_Guide_To_CB_Radio /&gt; Later, The Farm's medical and security communications utilized [[Very high frequency|VHF]] FM handheld [[two-way radio]]s.

[[Image:Farmschool logo.png|thumb|100px|The Farm School Logo]]
The Farm School Solar and Satellite Campuses are [[K-12]] programs that offer [[alternative education]] options for home-based learners (over 1200 students) and at a schoolhouse (approximately 25 students) on The Farm.&lt;ref name="thefarmschool.community"&gt;{{cite web |title=The Farm School |url=http://thefarmschool.community | access-date=2018-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Satellite Campuses Program is a home- and community-based learning program for home educators, homeschoolers, and unschoolers. Peter Kindfield is the principal.

The school's mission is "Supporting individuals learning together as we interact, form relationships and build community with each other and the rest of the world."&lt;ref name="thefarmschool.community"/&gt;

==In the media==
Farm founder, long-time resident and former UPI wire service journalist Melvyn Stiriss speaks about The Farm at colleges, universities and centers around the U.S. His book ''Voluntary Peasants'' is the most recent comprehensive book about the history and experience of living on The Farm.

The Farm was featured in [[Peter Jenkins (travel author)|Peter Jenkins]]' travel book ''[[A Walk Across America]]''. Jenkins lived and worked at the farm in the seventies for some time before continuing his trip. Jenkins's canine companion, Cooper, was accidentally run over and killed by the farm's water truck while he was playfully sprinting underneath the moving truck from one side to the other.

A feature documentary about growing up on The Farm, ''American Commune'', has been produced by filmmakers, former residents and sisters, Rena Mundo Croshere and Nadine Mundo.

A book on The Farm written by members and former members and edited by Rupert Fike is ''Voices from The Farm'' which includes many never-before-published images from The Farm's early years.

Another book on The Farm written by Douglas Stevenson is ''Out To Change The World''. This book too includes many never-before-published images from The Farm's early years.

==Synopsis==
'''''The Intangibles of Leadership''''' uncovers patterns in the attributes that truly distinguish those who succeed at the top. After more than a decade of senior executive assessments, CEO interviews, and proprietary research, Davis found that extraordinary leaders possess certain characteristics that fall between the lines of existing leadership models, yet are fundamental to executive success. Davis explains each of these qualities, the people who exemplify them, how to detect them in others, and how to develop the subtle characteristics that will enable leaders to stand out from the pack. The book has been highly reviewed and was named as a "Top Business Book of 2010 by Library Journal".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.libraryjournal.com/lj/collectiondevelopmentspecialty2/888437-483/lj_best_business_books_2010.html.csp#management BS010611BestBusiness&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130120052045/http://www.libraryjournal.com/lj/collectiondevelopmentspecialty2/888437-483/lj_best_business_books_2010.html.csp#management |date=2013-01-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ten Intangibles outlined in the book are:
# Wisdom
# Will
# Executive Maturity
# Integrity
# Social Judgment
# Presence
# Self-Insight
# Self-Efficacy
# Fortitude
# Fallibility

According to the author, the book is a practical atlas of the characteristics that most define extraordinary leaders and their underlying psychological mechanisms. It was designed as a mirror to help executives think about how they approach leadership and gain insights that can enable them to grow and develop.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4005">'''Trading with the Enemy Act''' is a stock [[short title]] used for [[legislation]] in the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[United States]] relating to [[trading with the enemy]].

'''Trading with the Enemy Acts''' is also a generic name for a class of legislation generally passed during or approaching a war that prohibit not just mercantile activities with foreign nationals, but also acts that might assist the enemy.&lt;ref&gt;Phelps, Shirelle and Lehman, Jeffrey (editors) (2005) "Aiding the enemy acts" ''West's Encyclopedia of American Law'' (2nd edition) Vol. 1.  Gale, Detroit, Michigan, pp.&amp;nbsp;182&amp;ndash;183&lt;/ref&gt; While originally limited to wartime, in the 20th century these Acts were applied in cases of national emergency as well.  For example, in 1940, before the United States entry into [[World War II]] the president imposed broad prohibitions on the transfer of property in which Norway or Denmark, or any citizen or national of those countries, or any other person aiding those countries, had any interest, with the exception of transfers which were licensed under the regulations of the Department of the Treasury.&lt;ref&gt;Malloy, Michael P.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7004">'''VoteOnMarriage.org''' was a [[United States|U.S.]] political organization in the state of [[Massachusetts]] dedicated to the passage of a constitutional amendment to the [[Massachusetts Constitution]] to ban [[same-sex marriage]]. Its goal was to have the amendment voted on by the people of Massachusetts in the 2008 general election, but the amendment failed when it was defeated by a joint session of the [[Massachusetts General Court|Massachusetts Legislature]].

==Overview==
Led by evangelical preacher Roberto S. Miranda and Kris Mineau, the group was successful in getting the Massachusetts Legislature to vote on a proposed ban on future same sex marriages. The Massachusetts Constitution requires 50 affirmative votes (25%) at two consecutive Constitutional Conventions of the legislature, and the initial vote for the ban was 62 in favor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/news/specials/gay_marriage/articles/2007/01/03/same_sex_marriage_ban_advances/|title=Same-sex marriage ban advances: Lawmakers OK item for ballot, but hurdle remains|date=January 3, 2007|author=Frank Phillips and Lisa Wangsness|work=[[The Boston Globe]]|accessdate=October 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second vote was defeated with 45 members voting in favor, so the issue was not included on 2008 ballot and same-sex marriage remained legal in Massachusetts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Frank | last=Phillips | title=Legislators vote to defeat same-sex marriage ban | date=June 14, 2007 | work=The Boston Globe | url=http://www.boston.com/news/globe/city_region/breaking_news/2007/06/legislators_vot_1.html | accessdate = October 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mission==
VoteOnMarriage.org stated that its Massachusetts Protection of Marriage Amendment would permit Massachusetts citizens to vote on the definition of marriage&lt;ref name=aboutus&gt;[http://www.voteonmarriage.org/aboutus.shtml Vote on Marriage: About Us]&lt;/ref&gt; and that "Marriage as the union of a man and a woman is the universal model and predates all nations, religions and laws. The heterosexual marital relationship reflects the fundamental essence of laws of nature and anatomy, and ensures procreation and the nurturing of children."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.voteonmarriage.org/faqs.shtml Vote on Marriage: FAQ]&lt;/ref&gt;  The organization supported a Benefits Fairness Act that would allow some benefits for two adults in a dependent relationship who were ineligible for marriage.&lt;ref name=aboutus /&gt;

==Controversy==
VoteOnMarriage.org was accused of employing forgery and [[bait-and-switch]] techniques to obtain fraudulent signatures for their petition drive, and the Massachusetts Attorney General initiated a criminal investigation regarding the forgery allegations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=State investigating gay marriage signature forgery allegations |first=Steve |last=LeBlanc |agency=[[Associated Press]] |date=February 28, 2006 |publisher=''The Boston Globe''}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group [[Knowthyneighbor.org]] published a searchable online database listing names and addresses of the petition signers, allowing signatures to be checked for fraud and complaints to be reported.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.knowthyneighbor.org/fraud.html KnowThyNeighbor.org - Protect marriage for ALL families in MA]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/01/us/01petition.html |title=Privacy Looms Over Gay Rights Vote |first=William |last=Yardley |date=October 31, 2009 |work=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 9, 2006, shortly after a news report of a paid signature gatherer alleging to the media she defrauded citizens, VoteOnMarriage.org sent a letter to the Secretary of State of Massachusetts asking his office to investigate the matter. The letter stated that VoteOnMarriage.org sought to comply fully with all applicable laws during the signature gathering process and had been found in full compliance by the Attorney General. The letter also raised concerns about the legitimacy of the petition complaint reporting processes established by Knowthyneighbor.org.&lt;ref&gt;[http://voteonmarriage.org/news.shtml#060109pr VoteOnMarriage.org Seeks Investigation of Anti-Vote Websites and Prosecution of Paid Circulator | No Formal Challenges Filed by Signature Opponents]&lt;/ref&gt;

The deadline period for filing complaints with the Election’s Division of the Secretary of the Commonwealth’s office related to the petition process was January 6, 2006.  No formal challenges to the VoteOnMarriage.org signature-gathering effort were filed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/news/globe/editorial_opinion/oped/articles/2005/12/22/fraud_taints_antigay_measure/|title=Fraud taints antigay measure|first=John C.|last=Bonifaz|date=December 22, 2005|work=The Boston Globe|accessdate=October 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prospects==
According to a March, 2005 poll conducted by ''[[The Boston Globe]]'', 56% of voters in Massachusetts supported the State's [[Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court|Supreme Judicial Court]] and its ruling in ''[[Goodridge v. Dept. of Public Health]]'', while only 37% opposed the ruling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/news/specials/gay_marriage/articles/2005/05/16/passage_of_marriage_amendment_in_doubt/|title=Passage of marriage amendment in doubt|first=Raphael|last=Lewis|date=May 16, 2005|work=The Boston Globe|accessdate=October 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

VoteOnMarriage.org cited a poll conducted by the State House News Service in Massachusetts finding that 75% of registered voters believed that the people, not the courts, should decide the definition of marriage in Massachusetts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.voteonmarriage.org/news.shtml#060505pr Marriage Amendment Legislative Vote will be Delayed | New Poll Shows 75% of Registered Voters Want to Vote On Marriage]&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 14, 2007, the most recent effort to enable a constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage failed, and no active effort to do so continues.&lt;ref&gt;[http://voteonmarriage.com VoteOnMarriage.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Wisconsin Association of School Councils''' (WASC) is a "statewide organization of public, private, and parochial elementary, middle, junior, and senior high school student leadership groups dedicated to the continuation and expansion of leadership development and student responsibilities in Wisconsin." It is a non-profit, student-led, student-run youth leadership and advocacy organization.&lt;ref name=WASC/&gt;

==Overview==

===Misson Statement===
"The WASC is deeply committed to the continuation and expansion of leadership development in the State of Wisconsin."&lt;ref name=WASC /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About WASC|url=https://www.facebook.com/WASCLeader/info/?tab=overview|website=WASC Facebook Page|accessdate=26 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Wisconsin Association of School Councils founded at the [[University of Wisconsin-Madison]] in 1935.  In that year, it was named the Wisconsin High School Student Council Association. (WHSSCA)

From 1935-1946, WHSSCA held statewide conferences for high school [[student council]]s, sponsored by and at the [[University of Wisconsin-Madison]]. In 1946, Gerald Van Pool voiced concern about the how the organization was being run. He then began serving as the Executive Secretary to strengthen the organization of the association. Van Pool accepted a job at the National Student Council Association in [[Washington, D.C.]], in 1947 after serving as Executive Secretary for one year. Van Pool influenced the WHSSCA into joining the National Student Council Association.

In January 1948, the name of the association changed from the Wisconsin High School Student Council Association (WHSSCA) to the Wisconsin Association of Student Councils (WASC) This happened under the direction of Bernard A. Kennedy of [[Prairie du Chien]], the Executive Secretary from 1947-1951.

The WASC’s third Executive Secretary was George Heatherington of [[La Crosse]], (1951-1957), the fourth was Ralph Mithy of [[Janesville, Wisconsin|Janesville]], (1957-1959) and the fifth was Donald A. Wendt of Madison (1959-1972). During Wendt’s term, the WASC was subject to protest and request to change, but the association remained constant. In YEAR, a monthly Newsletter was created and was edited by the Executive Secretary. In 1961, Gerald Van Pool and Donald A. Wendt structured the first WASC Summer Leadership Workshop, held in [[Stevens Point, Wisconsin]].

In 1972, the sixth Executive Secretary, Larry Hanson, [[Plainfield (town), Wisconsin|Plainfield]], was elected (1972-1973). During his term, a new constitution and by-laws were established, and the Wisconsin Secondary School Administrators Association (WSSAA) began sponsoring the WASC.  The new constitution was ratified in October 1973, which created a State Governing Board and Executive Committee. These consisted of an equal ratio of students and adults elected from within six regions. There was to be also an equality of representation of junior and middle school (JAM) and senior high schools (SHS). The member schools of each region were required to have two annual meetings, and the state conference was moved from fall to spring. With the implication of the State Governing Board and Executive Committee and new [[stipulation]]s, the WASC became the country’s only [[student council]] organization with equality of students and adults as voting representatives.

Donald C. Larsen was hired in the fall of 1973 and worked as the first shared WSSAA/WASC Executive, and served as the WASC’s Executive Director, a position previously named Executive Secretary (1973-2000). To more correctly describe school involvement in their organization, the WASC replaced the word “Student” with the word “School” in their title; making their name the Wisconsin Association of School Councils. Larsen created a foundation committed to enhancing student leadership in the WASC.&lt;ref name=DCL&gt;{{cite web|title=WASC Donald C. Larsen Foundation|url=https://www.linkedin.com/company/wasc-donald-c.-larsen-foundation|website=Linkedin|accessdate=27 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The WASC State office was created in [[Stevens Point]], but moved to [[Madison, Wisconsin|Madison]] in 1979. A series of programs were established in the 1970s and 1980s for students and advisors to advance their [[leadership]] abilities. Some include Annual WASC Advisor Conference (1973), Cheer/Poms Camps (1975), Annual Nation Honor Society State Conference (1977), and Annual Elementary School State Conference (1979), Advanced Summer Leadership Camps, Wisconsin Association of Cheer/Pom Coaches (WACPC) (1988).

In the 1990s, two more state offices were added to the organization for JAM schools. On December 15, 1997, the WASC Governing Board approved the WASC FOUNDATION and ENDOWMENT organization and the WASC TORCH BEARERS. Succeeding Donald C. Larsen as Executive Director was Roger L. Chambers (2000-2005), then Michelle McGrath (2000-).&lt;ref name=WASCHistory&gt;{{cite web|title=History|url=http://www.wasc.org/history/|website=Wisconsin School Association of School Councils, inc.|accessdate=26 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==

===Regions===
The WASC splits Wisconsin into six regions. Those are, I: Whitetail Region; II:  Northlands Region; III: Fox River Valley Region; IV: Metropolitan Region; V: Capitol Region; VI: Big Rivers Region. Each region has their own [[bylaws]] and elect new Regional Officers each year.  Student officers serve for one year, and adults serve for three years.&lt;ref name=WASCHistory/&gt;

===Regional Bylaws===
Each regions' bylaws consist of ordinances regarding name, membership, organization and management, caucuses, regional officers, duties of regional officers, vacancies, and amendments.&lt;ref name=WASC&gt;{{cite web|title=Wisconsin Association of School Councils, inc.|url=http://www.wasc.org|accessdate=26 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Events==
The WASC offers many events including:
