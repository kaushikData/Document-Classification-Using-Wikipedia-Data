In 2015, [[United States Attorney|U.S. federal prosecutors]] disclosed cases of corruption by officials and associates connected with the Fédération Internationale de Football Association ([[FIFA]]), the governing body of [[association football]], [[futsal]] and [[beach soccer]].

Near the end of May 2015, fourteen people were indicted in connection with an investigation by the United States [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) and the [[Internal Revenue Service]] [[IRS Criminal Investigation Division|Criminal Investigation Division]] (IRS-CI) into [[wire fraud]], [[racketeering]], and [[money laundering]]. The [[United States Attorney General]] simultaneously announced the unsealing of the indictments and the prior guilty pleas by four football executives and two corporations.

The investigation mostly revolved around [[collusion]] between officials of continental football bodies [[CONMEBOL]] (South America) and [[CONCACAF]] (Caribbean, Central and North America), and [[sports marketing]] executives. The sports marketing executives were holders of media and marketing rights for high-profile international competitions including the Americas' [[FIFA World Cup]] qualifying tournaments, and showpiece tournaments [[CONCACAF Gold Cup]] and [[Copa América]].

CONCACAF President [[Jeffrey Webb]], also serving president of the [[Cayman Islands Football Association]], was arrested in connection with the investigation, as were two sitting [[FIFA Executive Committee]] members: [[Eduardo Li]] of the [[Costa Rican Football Federation]] and [[Eugenio Figueredo]], formerly of the [[Uruguayan Football Association]], and former CONMEBOL President [[Nicolás Leoz]]. The investigation lasted several years, with the first arrest, of former CONCACAF president [[Jack Warner (football executive)|Jack Warner]]'s son Daryll, made in July 2013.&lt;ref name="Actual Indictments"&gt;{{cite web|title=FIFA Indictments|url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/05/27/sports/soccer/document-fifa-indictments.html|accessdate=28 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DOJ-PR"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/nine-fifa-officials-and-five-corporate-executives-indicted-racketeering-conspiracy-and|title=Nine FIFA Officials and Five Corporate Executives Indicted for Racketeering Conspiracy and Corruption|date=27 May 2015|accessdate=27 May 2015|publisher=[[United States Department of Justice]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In total, seven current FIFA officials were arrested at the Hotel [[Baur au Lac]] in [[Zürich]] on 27 May. They were preparing to attend the [[65th FIFA Congress]], which was scheduled to include the election of the [[president of FIFA]].&lt;ref name=GuardMay2715&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/may/27/several-top-fifa-officials-arrested|title=Fifa officials arrested on corruption charges as World Cup inquiry launched|date=27 May 2015|work=The Guardian|accessdate=27 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are expected to be extradited to the United States on suspicion of receiving {{US$|150&amp;nbsp;million|link=yes}} in bribes.&lt;ref name=GuardMay2715 /&gt; There was also a simultaneous raid on the CONCACAF headquarters in Miami,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Matthew |first=Jennie |url=https://sports.yahoo.com/news/us-prosecutors-allege-world-cup-soccer-fraud-171045862--sow.html |title=US prosecutors allege 'World Cup' of soccer fraud|agency=Agence France-Presse|date=27 May 2015|accessdate=28 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later, two further men handed themselves in to police for arrest: Jack Warner and marketing executive [[Alejandro Burzaco]].&lt;ref name="Warner-arrest" /&gt;&lt;ref name="burzaco-italy" /&gt; Two further arrests of FIFA officials at the hotel occurred in December 2015.&lt;ref name=BBCDec15&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/34991874|title=Fifa arrests: Two Fifa vice-presidents detained at Zurich hotel|date=3 December 2015|work=''BBC News''|accessdate=3 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Allegations==
The 2015 arrests centre on the alleged use of [[bribery]], [[fraud]] and [[money laundering]] to corrupt the issuing of media and marketing rights for FIFA games in [[the Americas]], estimated at $150&amp;nbsp;million,&lt;ref name="DOJ-PR"/&gt; including at least $110&amp;nbsp;million in bribes related to the [[Copa América Centenario]] to be hosted in 2016 in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2015/may/27/fifa-officials-arrested-on-corruption-charges-live#block-5565d9c9e4b0ab5615399afd|title=Fifa in crisis amid corruption arrests and World Cup voting inquiry – live updates (15:51)|author =Bryan Armen Graham|date=27 May 2015|accessdate=27 May 2015|newspaper=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the indictment handed down by the [[United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York|U.S. District Court]] in [[Brooklyn]], New York, alleges that bribery was used in an attempt to influence clothing sponsorship contracts, the [[FIFA World Cup hosts#2010 FIFA World Cup|selection process]] for the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]] host, and [[61st FIFA Congress#2011 presidential election|the 2011 FIFA presidential election]].&lt;ref name="DOJ-PR" /&gt; Specifically, an unnamed sports equipment company – identified in multiple sources as [[Nike, Inc.]]&lt;ref name="Guardian-Nike"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/may/28/fifa-crisis-blatter-calls-resign-sponsors-disappointment|title=Fifa scandal: Visa sponsorship threat compounds calls for Blatter to quit|newspaper=The Guardian|author1=Claire Phipps |author2=Damien Gayle |date=28 May 2015|access-date=28 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Forbes-Nike"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/darrenheitner/2015/05/27/major-u-s-sportswear-company-implicated-in-soccer-bribery-scheme/|title=Nike Implicated in Soccer Bribery Scheme|newspaper=Forbes|author =Darren Heitner|date=27 May 2015|access-date=28 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HuffPo-Nike"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/05/27/fifa-scandal-nike-brazil_n_7453032.html|title=Nike Just Became Part of the FIFA Corruption Scandal|newspaper=HuffPost|author1=Lucy McCalmont |author2=Ben Walsh |date=27 May 2015|access-date=28 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; – is alleged to have paid at least $40&amp;nbsp;million in bribes to become the sole provider of uniforms, footwear, accessories, and equipment to the [[Brazil national football team|Brazil national team]].&lt;ref name="Guardian-Nike" /&gt;

In December 2010, federal law enforcement agents secured the undercover cooperation of American football executive and CONCACAF official [[Chuck Blazer]].&lt;ref name="nydailynews.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/soccer/soccer-rat-ex-u-s-soccer-exec-chuck-blazer-fbi-informant-article-1.1995761|title=Soccer Rat!

(The United States is one of two countries that broadly exercise worldwide jurisdiction to [[Income tax in the United States|tax the net income of its citizens]] from any source in the world; it also [[Taxation of illegal income in the United States|requires taxpayers to report and pay tax on illegal income]], and exercises [[Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act|worldwide jurisdiction over all financial institutions with U.S.-based account holders]].) Blazer agreed to cooperate almost immediately after two agents approached him in New York and confronted him with proof of his tax crimes.&lt;ref name="nydailynews.com"/&gt;

In December 2010, [[Prince William, Duke of Cambridge]] and former British Prime Minister [[David Cameron]] attended a meeting with FIFA vice-president [[Chung Mong-joon]] in which a vote-trading deal for the right to host the 2018 World Cup was discussed.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/06/27/prince-william-david-cameron-caught-fifa-corruption-scandal/ Prince William and David Cameron caught up in Fifa corruption scandal]".

''The Belfast Telegraph''. 28 June 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2013, Blazer pleaded guilty to 10 criminal charges including wire fraud conspiracy, money laundering, and offenses involving income tax and banking. Blazer's guilty plea had aimed to stave off a more serious charge of racketeering, which carried a potential 20-year prison sentence. Blazer would later make secret recordings of meetings with FIFA officials, and allegedly carried a recording device concealed in a key ring during the [[2012 Summer Olympics]] in London.&lt;ref name="nydailynews.com"/&gt; The [[Information (formal criminal charge)|information]] against Blazer (the charging document used in lieu of an indictment for a [[Plea bargaining in the United States|plea bargain]]) was revealed on 27 May 2015, the same day that the arrests were made in Zurich.&lt;ref name=GuardBlazer&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/may/27/fifa-arrests-corruption-loretta-lynch-chuck-blazer|title=Fifa arrests: how a well-placed insider and stashed cash helped US build case|author =Dan Roberts|date=27 May 2015|work=The Guardian|accessdate=27 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NYTMay2715&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/28/sports/soccer/fifa-officials-arrested-on-corruption-charges-blatter-isnt-among-them.html|title=FIFA Officials Arrested on Corruption Charges; Sepp Blatter Isn't Among Them|author1=Matt Apuzzo |author2=Michael S.

In 2011, Phaedra Al-Majid, who was part of the successful 2022 Qatari World Cup Bid, came forward as a whistle-blower. She claimed that Qatar paid $1.5 million to African Football Confederation president [[Issa Hayatou]], Ivory Coast FIFA member [[Jacques Anouma]] and Nigeria's suspended official [[Amos Adamu]] to vote for Qatar; all three denied the allegations. She later stated that she had fabricated her claims for media attention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Qatar 2022 'whistleblower' in corruption U-turn|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/14098944|accessdate=10 June 2015|publisher=BBC Sport|date=10 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hayatou and Anouma backed by Caf over bribery claims|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/13417453|accessdate=10 June 2015|publisher=BBC Sport|date=16 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Al-Majid co-operated with the [[Garcia Report]].&lt;ref name="almajid-custody" /&gt; In November 2014, she stated that she was coerced into withdrawing her allegations as she feared for her safety and due to her lack of legal representation.&lt;ref name="coerced-retraction"&gt;{{cite news|title=Fifa whistleblower Phaedra Al-Majid fears for her safety|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/30122601|accessdate=10 June 2015|publisher=BBC Sport|date=20 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of June 2015, she was in FBI protective custody, when she stated, "The FBI have everything...

In May 2011, ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' published claims from a whistle-blower that [[List of Presidents of CAF|President of CAF]] [[Issa Hayatou]] had, along with fellow Executive Committee member Jacques Anouma, accepted $1.5&amp;nbsp;million bribes from Qatar to secure his support for their bid for the 2022 FIFA World Cup.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

In 2013, former [[List of presidents of FIFA|FIFA President]] [[João Havelange]] and the [[Brazilian Football Confederation]] President [[Ricardo Teixeira]] were both found to have taken bribes worth millions of dollars.

===$10&amp;nbsp;million South African payment===
In the wake of the corruption case, it was reported that in 2008 the general secretary of FIFA, [[Jérôme Valcke]] was alleged to have transferred $10&amp;nbsp;million that had been given to FIFA by [[Danny Jordaan]], president of the [[South African Football Association]], to accounts controlled by Jack Warner, then head of CONCACAF. The payment is a key piece of the American prosecutors' indictment that accuses Warner of taking a bribe in exchange for helping South Africa secure the right to host the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]].&lt;ref name=Valcke&gt;{{cite news|title=Bribery Inquiry Drawing Closer to FIFA's President, Sepp Blatter

The Trinidadian supermarket chain JTA Supermarkets also received $4,860,000 from the FIFA payment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-33039014|title=Fifa corruption: Documents show details of Jack Warner 'bribes'|work=''BBC News''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2014 World Cup===
The FBI also investigating the 2014 World Cup.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/jun/04/fifa-corruption-crisis-fbi-inquiry-now-includes-2014-world-cup-in-brazil|title=Fifa corruption crisis: FBI inquiry now includes 2014 Brazil World Cup|author =Owen Gibson|work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Laws used in charging===
The Department of Justice has not charged anybody at FIFA with bribery. Prosecutors have instead alleged racketeering, [[Mail and wire fraud|wire fraud]], and [[money laundering]] conspiracies under the [[Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act]] (RICO) Act, which was intended for use against the Mafia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.economist.com/news/international/21653613-why-america-and-not-another-country-going-after-fifa-worlds-lawyer|title=The world's lawyer|work=The Economist|date=6 June 2015|accessdate=30 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, officials have been charged with violations of the Travel Act. The relevant part of the law essentially says that it is illegal to engage in interstate or foreign travel, or use the mails or "any facility in interstate commerce" to promote, manage, establish or carry on an illegal activity. That activity can be illegal under either federal or state law. Bribery is definitely included on the list of what is considered an illegal activity under the Travel Act. Any relevant transaction, even if it is only tangentially related to America, can be targeted. In one instance, a representative of First Caribbean International Bank in the Bahamas flew to New York to pick up a cheque for $250,000 (the alleged bribe) from the bribe recipient to transport it safely back to the defendant's bank account.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/economist-explains/2015/06/economist-explains|title=How America is pursuing FIFA|work=The Economist|date=1 June 2015|accessdate=30 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Swiss criminal inquiries===
{{See also|Garcia Report}}
FIFA commissioned former United States Attorney [[Michael J. Garcia]] to investigate and [[Garcia Report|report]] on the [[2018 and 2022 FIFA World Cup bids|bidding processes]] behind the awarding of the [[2018 FIFA World Cup]] to Russia and the [[2022 FIFA World Cup]] to Qatar. In November 2014, FIFA made a copy of Garcia's report available to the Attorney General of Switzerland, who then stated that there were "grounds for suspicion that, in isolated cases, international transfers of assets with connections to Switzerland took place which merit examination by the criminal prosecution authorities".&lt;ref name=GuardNov14&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/nov/18/fifa-criminal-complaint-world-cup-bids|title=Fifa lodges criminal complaint with Swiss courts over World Cup bids|date=14 November 2012|work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=26 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
[[Sepp Blatter]] had been president of FIFA since 1998 (until his removal in December 2015). ''The Guardian'' said that FIFA's actions would "... inevitably be viewed with cynicism given Blatter's track record of using the Swiss courts and FIFA's regulatory processes to kick problematic issues into the long grass and deflect attention onto individuals who have already left football".&lt;ref name=GuardNov14 /&gt;

In May 2015, on the same day as the arrests resulting from the FBI's investigation and in a separate action, the Swiss prosecuting authorities launched a criminal inquiry on "suspicion of criminal mismanagement and of money laundering" concerning the 2018 and 2022 bidding processes. The Swiss authorities seized "electronic data and documents" in a raid on FIFA's Zürich headquarters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/live/world-europe-32897157|title=Fifa corruption inquiry|date=26 May 2015|publisher=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=26 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Swiss police also planned to question ten members of the [[FIFA Executive Committee]] who participated in the December 2010 votes that chose the hosts for the 2018 and 2022 world cups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-32895048|title=Fifa corruption inquiry|date=27 May 2015|publisher=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=27 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2015, Switzerland was investigating a payment Blatter authorised in 2011 to the president of the [[UEFA|Union of European Football Associations (UEFA)]] [[Michel Platini]] for work done between 1999 and 2002.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/sepp-blatter/11891462/Sepp-Blatter-under-criminal-investigation-at-Fifa-live.html Sepp Blatter under criminal investigation by Swiss officials over 'disloyal payment' to Michel Platini – as it happened], ''The Telegraph'', 27 September 2015
&lt;/ref&gt; They also launched an investigation of possible "criminal mismanagement" by Blatter in a 2005 TV rights deal he signed with Jack Warner.

In March 2017 FIFA submitted 1300 pages of reports to the Swiss Attorney General's office. The investigation is expected to take up to 5 years to complete.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/sports/soccer/la-sp-fifa-investigation-20170331-story.html|title=FIFA sends 1,300-page corruption investigation to Swiss attorney general|first=Associated|last=Press|website=Los Angeles Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Television rights===

In September 2015, Swiss public television channel [[Schweizer Radio und Fernsehen|SRF]] published that Blatter would have sold the 2010 and 2014 FIFA World Cup rights in North America for US$600,000, a small fraction of their market value.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sport24.co.za/Soccer/International/Did-Blatter-give-Warner-discount-20150912 Did Blatter give Warner discount?] – Sports 24, 12 September 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, FIFA affiliate [[International Sports and Leisure]] went bankrupt in what were viewed in some circles as suspicious circumstances.&lt;ref name=bung&gt;{{cite news|last1=Jennings|first1=Andrew|authorlink1=Andrew Jennings|title=The Beautiful Bung: Corruption and the World Cup|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/panorama/5070224.stm|accessdate=10 June 2015|work=Panorama|date=11 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002 a FIFA [[whistleblower]] contacted British journalist [[Andrew Jennings]] relating to alleged corruption within FIFA itself.&lt;ref name=miller&gt;{{cite news|last1=Miller|first1=Michael E.|title=How a curmudgeonly old reporter exposed the FIFA scandal that toppled Sepp Blatter|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2015/06/03/how-a-curmudgeonly-old-reporter-exposed-the-fifa-scandal-that-toppled-sepp-blatter/|accessdate=10 June 2015|work=[[The Washington Post]]|date=3 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following investigations Swiss magistrate [[Thomas Hildbrand]] seized documents from FIFA offices in 2005&lt;ref name=bung /&gt; and in 2007 Jennings published a book – ''Foul'' – and broadcast the [[BBC]] ''Panorama'' documentary "The Beautiful Bung: Corruption and the World Cup".&lt;ref name=miller /&gt; ''Panorama'' later aired the "Fifa and Co" documentary in 2007, which contained an allegation of soliciting a bribe against [[Jack Warner (football executive)|Jack Warner]] and a court judgement that [[Jérôme Valcke]] had lied in FIFA business dealings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Fifa and Coe|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/panorama/7056420.stm|accessdate=10 June 2015|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=29 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; These reports led the [[FBI]] to contact Jennings in 2009.&lt;ref name=miller /&gt;

On 29 November 2010 the BBC broadcast ''[[FIFA's Dirty Secrets]]'', a second documentary by Jennings.&lt;ref name=miller /&gt; This was aired just days before the results of the [[2018 and 2022 FIFA World Cup bids]] in Zurich, Switzerland. Following the bidding process, [[FIFA]] announced that Russia and Qatar had [[2018 and 2022 FIFA World Cup bids|won the rights]] to stage the [[2018 FIFA World Cup|2018]] and [[2022 FIFA World Cup|2022]] World Cups respectively. The result immediately caused controversies, as Russia is accused of a high level of racism in football and  because of its involvement in the [[Ukrainian crisis]]. After it was announced that Russia would host 2018 FIFA World Cup, Dr Rafał Pankowski, a head of UEFA FARE Monitoring Centre, accused the Russian Football Union of downplaying racist chants in stadiums.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/dec/03/world-cup-2018-russian-racism |title=World Cup 2018 win raises Russian racism fears |first=Rajeev |last=Syal |date=3 December 2010 |work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=30 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation in 2014 led to several British and American politicians calling on FIFA to overturn its decision of hosting the 2018 World Cup in Russia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-26679542|title=Fifa urged to rethink staging 2018 World Cup in Russia|publisher=BBC|date=21 March 2013|accessdate=30 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Criticism from a number of media outlets, sporting experts, and human rights groups also highlighted problems such as Qatar's limited football history, the high expected cost, the local climate, and Qatar's human rights record.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sports.yahoo.com/news/14-reasons-qatar-world-cup-174400894.html|title=14 reasons the Qatar World Cup is going to be a disaster|author =Tony Manfred|publisher=[[Yahoo!

In 2011, former [[MI6]] spy [[Christopher Steele]] began providing information and sources to the FBI, which helped advance the investigation.&lt;ref name="yorker"&gt;{{cite news |work=[[The New Yorker]] |date=March 2018 |first=Jane |last=Mayer |url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/03/12/christopher-steele-the-man-behind-the-trump-dossier |title=Christopher Steele, the Man Behind the Trump Dossier |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180305154848/https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/03/12/christopher-steele-the-man-behind-the-trump-dossier |archive-date=5 March 2018 |quote=In 2011, Steele contacted an American agent he'd met who headed the Bureau's division for serious crimes in Eurasia. Steele introduced him to his sources, who proved essential to the ensuing investigation.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2011 a whistleblower, later revealed to be Phaedra Almajid who was a member of the Qatari bid team for the 2022 World Cup, claimed that money was paid to FIFA's executive committee in order to buy votes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/13345669|title=Caf's Hayatou and Anouma accused of taking Qatar bribes|publisher=BBC Sport}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, she retracted these claims in July 2011,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/14098944|title=Qatar 2022 'whistleblower' in corruption U-turn|author =David Bond|publisher=BBC Sport}}&lt;/ref&gt; later claiming that she had been coerced into making these retractions.&lt;ref name="coerced-retraction" /&gt;

On May 2013, former [[CONCACAF]] executive [[Chuck Blazer]] was arrested (and later indicted) on bribery charges. [[Jack Warner (football executive)|Jack Warner]] and Blazer were suspended from FIFA at around the same time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.insideworldfootball.com/world-football/football-americas/12369-audit-slays-concacafs-one-time-dynamic-duo|title=Audit slays CONCACAFs one-time dynamic duo – Inside World Football|author =Paul Nicholson|publisher=insideworldfootball.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then on 17 October 2014 FIFA announced that the [[Garcia Report]] into alleged bribery during the [[2018 and 2022 FIFA World Cup bids]] could not be released in full for legal reasons. Garcia later claimed that a summary of the report that ''was'' released misrepresents his findings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/world-cup/11228523/Fifa-has-misrepresented-my-report-says-investigator.html|title=Fifa report into World Cup bid process 'misrepresented', says investigator Michael Garcia|date=13 November 2014|work=The Daily Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arrests===
On the morning of 27 May 2015, seven FIFA officials were arrested just before the start of the [[65th FIFA Congress]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/11095/9866259/reports-fifa-officials-arrested|title=Officials arrested in Switzerland ahead of FIFA meeting|work=Sky Sports}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two days later [[Sepp Blatter]] comfortably defeated [[Prince Ali bin Hussein]] to remain as President of FIFA. [[David Gill (executive)|David Gill]] threatened to resign his newly elected role as FIFA Vice-President and member of the [[FIFA Executive Committee]].&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2015/may/29/fifa-to-vote-on-sepp-blatter-presidential-bid-amid-corruption-scandal-live|title=Sepp Blatter re-elected as Fifa president after Prince Ali Bin al-Hussein concedes defeat|date=29 May 2015|work=The Guardian|accessdate=4 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Jack Warner====

Later on 27 May, former FIFA Vice-President [[Jack Warner (football executive)|Jack Warner]] surrendered himself to police in his native Trinidad, where a court granted him bail. He spent a night in custody while bail was processed.&lt;ref name="Warner-arrest"/&gt;
On 31 May he posted a self-defence video on his Facebook page in which he proclaimed innocence while citing an article from satirical newspaper ''[[The Onion]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/trending/ex-fifa-official-uses-satirical-article-from-the-onion-to-blast-corruption-charges-1.3095793|title=Ex-FIFA official uses satirical article from the Onion to blast corruption charges|date=1 June 2015|publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]]|accessdate=4 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, on 3 June and following both the resignation of Sepp Blatter and the [[#Chuck_Blazer.27s_evidence_released_to_the_press|revelations]] of the former FIFA Executive [[Chuck Blazer]], Warner declared in a televised political address that he was no longer prepared to "keep secrets for them who actively seek to destroy the country" (Trinidad and Tobago) and that the "gloves [were] off". He also claimed to have "compiled a comprehensive and detailed series of documents including [[cheque]]s and corroborating statements" which he said revealed his "knowledge about certain transactions at [[FIFA]] including, but not limited to its president [[Sepp Blatter]]". Claiming further that he feared for his life, he declared, "(N)ot even death will stop the avalanche that is coming. The die is cast. There can be no turning back. Let the chips fall where they fall."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itv.com/news/2015-06-04/fifa-corruption-scandal-jack-warner-vows-to-release-avalanche-of-secrets/|title=Fifa corruption scandal: Jack Warner vows to release 'avalanche' of secrets|work=ITV News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3110498/Former-FIFA-vice-president-Jack-Warner-claims-prove-link-football-s-governing-body-Trinidad-Tobago-national-election.html|title=FIFA's Jack Warner sticks the knife into Sepp Blatter with documents claim |work=Daily Mail}}&lt;/ref&gt; l

In Blazer's partially-[[Sanitization (classified information)|redacted]] allocution, he claimed that he "and others, while acting in our official capacities, agreed to participate in a scheme to defraud [[FIFA]] and [[CONCACAF]] of the right to honest services by taking undisclosed bribes" and that he had "agreed with others in or around 1992 to facilitate the acceptance of a bribe in conjunction with the selection of the host nation for the [[1998 FIFA World Cup|1998 World Cup]].

Prime Minister [[David Cameron]] also backed calls for Blatter to quit as President of FIFA stating: "You cannot have accusations of corruption at this level and on this scale in this organisation and pretend that the person currently leading it is the right person to take it forward. That cannot be the case. Frankly, what we've seen is the ugly side of the beautiful game and he should go. And the sooner that happens the better – the faster that organisation can start to rebuild its credibility, which is going to be so important because so many people around the world want to see this game properly managed, properly looked after, so we can all enjoy the World Cups of the future."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-32913653 | title=Fifa: David Cameron backs calls for Sepp Blatter to quit | publisher=[[BBC News]] | date=28 May 2015 | accessdate=28 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Fifa's Sepp Blatter should go, says David Cameron|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-32931356|accessdate=31 May 2015|work=''BBC News''|date=29 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*{{flagu|Ireland}} – The [[Football Association of Ireland]]'s chief executive [[John Delaney (football administrator)|John Delaney]], speaking on national radio after Blatter's resignation, recalled: "In 2009, when Blatter insulted Ireland in the aftermath of the [[2009 Republic of Ireland v France football matches|Thierry Henry handball incident]] I called him an embarrassment to FIFA and to himself. He called me over about that, across the table like I am talking to you, with one or two expletives. That was in a room. He said, 'No-one speaks to me like that', and I said, 'well I do' and that was that."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.ie/sport/soccer/international-soccer/john-delaney-sepp-blatter-stared-at-my-partner-emma-and-said-i-approve-i-told-him-to-move-on-31278411.html|title=John Delaney: Sepp Blatter stared at my partner Emma and said 'I approve' – I told him to move on|work=Irish Independent|accessdate=4 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, Delaney said of the handball incident, "It's not about money. This is about sporting integrity." In June 2015, Delaney confirmed that FIFA gave the FAI a "loan" of €5&amp;nbsp;million which was in effect a payment not to proceed with legal action over the handball decision and consequent elimination from the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]]. The loan was written off in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rte.ie/sport/soccer/2015/0604/705872-delaney-confirm-fifa-payment-to-fai/|title=FIFA gave FAI €5m 'loan' to stop legal action over Thierry Henry handball|quote=That was a Thursday and on Monday the agreement was all signed and all done.

*{{flagu|South Africa}} – [[Danny Jordaan]], the head of the [[South African Football Association]], admitted to paying $10&amp;nbsp;million to a football body led by Jack Warner in 2008, but denied that it was a bribe for hosting the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Fifa crisis: South Africa 'admits $10m football payout'|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-32952078|accessdate=1 June 2015|work=''BBC News''|date=31 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*{{flagu|United States}} – The [[North American Soccer League]] Board of Governors suspended chairman [[Aaron Davidson]] and business relations with Traffic Sports. [[Carolina RailHawks]], a team owned by Traffic Sports, was allowed to "continue to operate in the ordinary course of business".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NASL STATEMENT ON U.S. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE INVESTIGATION|url=http://www.nasl.com/news/2015/05/27/nasl-statement-on-us-department-of-justice-investigation|publisher=NASL.com|accessdate=28 May 2015|date=27 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===FIFA sponsors===
In October 2015, four major FIFA sponsors, [[Coca-Cola]], [[McDonald's]], [[Visa Inc.|Visa]] and [[Budweiser]], called for Blatter to stand down immediately as FIFA president.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Coca-Cola, McDonald's demand Blatter steps down|url=http://www.football365.com/news/coca-cola-mcdonalds-demand-blatter-steps-down|website=Football365|date=3 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Interpol===
On 12 June 2015, international law enforcement agency [[Interpol]] announced it was suspending a 20 million euro donation by [[FIFA]] to fund an anti-gambling and match fixing program. Four million euros was spent in the first two years on prevention and education and another 1.5 million euros was set to be spent in the remaining eight years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2015/06/12/uk-fifa-interpol-idUKKBN0OS0UL20150612 |title=FIFA dismayed as Interpol suspends 20 million euro 'Integrity' pact|agency=Reuters|accessdate=12 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An Interpol spokesman said, "The agreement with FIFA includes a clause which states that 'the Funding Party declares notably that its activities are compatible with the principles, aims and activities of Interpol'. All external partners, whether public or private, must share the fundamental values and principles of the organisation, as well as the wider law enforcement community."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.interpol.int/News-and-media/News/2015/N2015-080 |title=INTERPOL suspends agreement with FIFA | accessdate=12 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

FIFA said it was disappointed by the decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2015/06/12/football/interpol-fifa-partnership/ |title=Interpol suspends $22.5m anti match-fixing partnership with FIFA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The donation for the 10-year Integrity in Sport program was originally accepted in 2011 by former Interpol Secretary-General [[Ronald Noble]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politico.eu/article/fifa-funded-interpol-policing/ |title=How Interpol got into bed with FIFA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16364">AIDS service organizations are community-based organizations that provide support for people affected by [[HIV/AIDS]]. This article focuses on HIV/AIDS service organizations in the United States only.

There is a huge variety of these organizations in order to provide for the wide variety of needs of HIV/AIDS patients and their families. The majority of these organizations are healthcare-based, providing assistance with [[diagnosis of HIV/AIDS|testing]], [[antiretroviral medication|treatment]], preventative medicines like [[Pre-exposure prophylaxis]] (PrEP), [[Needle exchange programme|needle and syringe exchanges]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.avert.org/professionals/hiv-programming/prevention/needle-syringe-programmes | title=Needle and syringe programmes (NSPs) for HIV prevention| date=2015-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; and more. Another prominent type of AIDS service organization is education-based, working to raise awareness and public understanding of topics like the [[HIV/AIDS#Transmission|transmission of HIV]], [[safe sex]], treatment resources, as well as eliminating rampant [[misconceptions about HIV/AIDS]]. Other organizations provide services like legal advice and/or advocacy, mental health and counseling services, and fundraising and community outreach.

These organizations are vital in providing for patients needs,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1521/aeap.2016.28.5.426| pmid=27710082|title = What Community-Based HIV Prevention Organizations Say About Their Role in Biomedical HIV Prevention| journal=AIDS Education and Prevention| volume=28| issue=5| pages=426–439|year = 2016|last1 = Smith|first1 = Dawn K.| last2=Maier| first2=Emily| last3=Betts| first3=Joshua| last4=Gray| first4=Simone| last5=Kolodziejski| first5=Brian| last6=Hoover| first6=Karen W.}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as reducing the economic impact of HIV/AIDS,&lt;ref name=aj&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.2105/AJPH.76.11.1325|title = The nonprofit sector's response to the AIDS epidemic: Community-based services in San Francisco| journal=American Journal of Public Health| volume=76| issue=11| pages=1325–1330|year = 1986|last1 = Arno|first1 = P. S.}}&lt;/ref&gt; strengthening global health, and countering the social and political imbalances which disproportionately impact HIV/AIDS patients.

== Development ==
The discovery of AIDS patients in the United States in the 1980s &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.avert.org/professionals/history-hiv-aids/overview | title=History of HIV and AIDS overview| date=2015-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; created a need for resources to be provided to patients and others affected by the disease. This is not unique to HIV/AIDS, there are organizations providing similar services for other diseases like [[:Category:Cancer organizations based in the United States|cancer organizations]] and [[:Category:Diabetes organizations|diabetes organizations]].

Many HIV/AIDS organizations are expansions of previously-existing [[LGBT community|LGBTQ]] [[:Category:LGBT health organizations in the United States|health organizations]], which are present in 32 states &lt;ref name=lgbt&gt;http://www.lgbtmap.org/file/2014-lgbt-community-center-survey-report.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and have evolved over time to serve the shifting needs of the LGBTQ community.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url=http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0180544# | doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0180544| pmid=28692659| pmc=5503273| title=Lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) health services in the United States: Origins, evolution, and contemporary landscape| journal=PLOS ONE| volume=12| issue=7| pages=e0180544| year=2017| last1=Martos| first1=Alexander J.| last2=Wilson| first2=Patrick A.| last3=Meyer| first3=Ilan H.}}&lt;/ref&gt; These organizations were created to serve LGBTQ people's specific healthcare concerns &lt;ref name=nc&gt;{{cite journal| pmc=2377288 | pmid=18445789 | doi=10.2105/AJPH.2007.127811 | volume=98 | issue=6 | title=Sexual and gender minority health: what we know and what needs to be done | year=2008 | author=Mayer KH, Bradford JB, Makadon HJ, Stall R, Goldhammer H, Landers S | journal=Am J Public Health | pages=989–95}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as counteract the [[Healthcare and the LGBT community#Issues affecting LGBT people generally|impact]] of social determinants, stigma, and bias. They readily adapted to address the HIV/AIDS epidemic. One example is the [[Los Angeles LGBT Center]], the largest LGBT service organization in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://lalgbtcenter.org | title=Home - Los Angeles LGBT Center}}&lt;/ref&gt; But not all AIDS service organizations were first LGBT centers. One of the most prominent early AIDS-specific organizations was/is New York's [[Gay Men's Health Crisis]].

Community-based AIDS organizations also worked collaboratively with widespread activist efforts to demand federal and social support, recognition, and equality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.nypl.org/events/exhibitions/why-we-fight/more | title=Why We Fight: Remembering AIDS Activism}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Services ==
These organizations provide a wide array of services to match the wide array of need, which is attributable to the interconnectedness of healthcare with [[Poverty#health|poverty]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.healthpovertyaction.org/info-and-resources/the-cycle-of-poverty-and-poor-health/key-facts/ | title=Key Facts Poverty and Poor Health}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.who.int/hdp/poverty/en/ | title=WHO &amp;#124; Poverty and health}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| pmc=1891652 | pmid=17464567 | doi=10.1007/s11524-007-9191-5 | volume=84 | issue=3 Suppl | title=Urban poverty: an urgent public health issue | year=2007 | author=Mercado S, Havemann K, Sami M, Ueda H | journal=J Urban Health | pages=i7–15}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Social issue#public health|social issues]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://ctb.ku.edu/en/table-of-contents/analyze/analyze-community-problems-and-solutions/social-determinants-of-health/main | title=Chapter 17.

Medical services are the priority of most of these organizations, due to factors which prevent many HIV/AIDS patients from receiving adequate care from mainstream healthcare providers. These factors include real or perceived discrimination in healthcare facilities&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.lambdalegal.org/publications/when-health-care-isnt-caring | title=When Health Care Isn't Caring}}&lt;/ref&gt; and insurance companies,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/lgbt/news/2017/05/02/429529/widespread-discrimination-continues-shape-lgbt-peoples-lives-subtle-significant-ways/ | title=Widespread Discrimination Continues to Shape LGBT People's Lives in Both Subtle and Significant Ways| date=2017-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; lack of [[Cultural competence in healthcare|cultural competence]] among healthcare providers about LGBT issues,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.hrc.org/blog/new-video-emphasizes-need-for-lgbt-cultural-competency-trainings-for-health | title=New Video Emphasizes Need for LGBT Cultural Competency Trainings for Healthcare Providers}}&lt;/ref&gt; and patients not wanting to be associated with AIDS, and/or, in some cases, the LBGT community. This is still widely occurring today but was especially prevalent during the HIV/AIDS crisis. "The optimal provision of health care and prevention services to sexual and gender minorities requires providers to be sensitive to historical stigmatization, to be informed about continued barriers to care and the differential prevalence of specific risk factors and health conditions in these populations, and to become aware of the cultural aspects of their interactions with LGBT patients." &lt;ref name=nc /&gt; Especially during the AIDS crisis, this was just not reality and AIDS service organizations were forced to fill in the gap.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/lgbt/reports/2009/12/21/7048/how-to-close-the-lgbt-health-disparities-gap/ | title=How to Close the LGBT Health Disparities Gap}}&lt;/ref&gt; AIDS organizations provide testing, treatment, symptom management, mental health services, and more.

Additionally, AIDS service organizations provide resources beyond medical services. 
The lack of knowledge about AIDS and the resulting panic and misinformation was the motivating force behind many community service organizations&lt;ref&gt;http://www.asaustin.org/about-us/history/&lt;/ref&gt; who worked to provide education and dispel myths about the disease. This continues to be an enormous issue today&lt;ref&gt;https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/assets/4856758/MAC_AIDS_Fund_US_Teen_Survey_-_Headline_Highlights.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and is one of the most important services AIDS organizations provides. They also can provide [[community health]] and wellness education,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/prevguid/p0000389/p0000389.asp | title=Guidelines for Health Education and Risk Reduction Activities}}&lt;/ref&gt; personal and family counseling,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.webmd.com/hiv-aids/psychotherapy-for-hiv-infection | title=HIV/AIDS and Mental Health}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[:Category:sexual health|healthy sexuality]] and [[sexually transmitted infection]] [[sexually transmitted infection#prevention|prevention]] awareness, [[Safe sex#Precautions|safe sex materials]], and legal advice and services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.lambdalegal.org | title=Lambda Legal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Obstacles ==
AIDS service organizations face the same obstacles that all health and social service organizations face: struggles for funding, labor, and resources, as well as the constant battle against a devastating illness. But there are many things which specifically hinder the efforts of AIDS organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1521/aeap.14.4.27.23886|title = Factors Affecting the Delivery of HIV/AIDS Prevention Programs by Community-Based Organizations| journal=AIDS Education and Prevention| volume=14| issue=3_supplement| pages=27–37|year = 2002|last1 = Chillag|first1 = Kata| last2=Bartholow| first2=Kelly| last3=Cordeiro| first3=Janna| last4=Swanson| first4=Sue| last5=Patterson| first5=Jocelyn| last6=Stebbins| first6=Selby| last7=Woodside| first7=Carol| last8=Sy| first8=Francisco}}&lt;/ref&gt; HIV/AIDS "plagues the world's most vulnerable people"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1080/19359705.2013.740212 | volume=17 | title=AIDS: A History | year=2013 | journal=Journal of Gay &amp; Lesbian Mental Health | pages=40–63 | author=Forstein Marshall}}&lt;/ref&gt; and they are highly dependent on service organizations due to [[social exclusion|marginalization]], [[social stigma|stigma]], and fear of social and legal [[Discrimination against people with HIV/AIDS#Influence on society|retribution]], both currently but especially during the height of the AIDS crisis.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cdc.gov/nchhstp/newsroom/docs/factsheets/challenges-508.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; "Health disparities are very evident"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1007/s10461-014-0903-z| pmid=25239154|title = Achieving and Advancing the Goals of the National HIV/AIDS Strategy for the United States| journal=AIDS and Behavior| volume=19| issue=2| pages=211–213|year = 2014|last1 = Holtgrave|first1 = David R.}}&lt;/ref&gt; as HIV/AIDS patients are disproportionately [[Men who have sex with men|MSM]], [[Trans woman|transgender women]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/group/gender/transgender/index.html | title=Transgender People &amp;#124; Gender &amp;#124; HIV by Group &amp;#124; HIV/AIDS &amp;#124; CDC| date=2018-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[poverty|low-income]], and/or [[Person of color|people of color]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.drugabuse.gov/publications/research-reports/hivaids/who-risk-hiv-infection-which-populations-are-most-affected | title=Who is at Risk for HIV Infection and Which Populations Are Most Affected?}}&lt;/ref&gt; HIV/AIDS also heavily impacts people suffering from [[Drug injection|IV drug]] [[addiction]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.drugabuse.gov/publications/research-reports/hivaids/how-does-drug-abuse-affect-hiv-epidemic | title=How Does Drug Abuse Affect the HIV Epidemic?}}&lt;/ref&gt; and/or [[homelessness]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nationalhomeless.org/factsheets/hiv.html | title=National Coalition for the Homeless}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are the people who are dependent on community centers and service organizations.&lt;ref name=lgbt /&gt;

The AIDS crisis was shadowed by constant politicization which magnified the struggles of HIV/AIDS patients, as well as heavily hindered [[HIV/AIDS research|research]] and the search for [[HIV/AIDS#treatment|treatment]] and/or a cure. The HIV virus wasn't discovered to be the cause of AIDS until 1984,&lt;ref name=aids&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.aids-services.com/news/hiv-history-part-1-spread-knowledge-not-panic/ | title=HIV History Part 1: Spread Knowledge, Not Panic &amp;#124; Lowcountry AIDS Services}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the first treatment, [[Zidovudine|AZT]], was not approved until 1987.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://time.com/4705809/first-aids-drug-azt/ | title=The Story Behind the First AIDS Drug, Approved 30 Years Ago}}&lt;/ref&gt; So there were long periods of time following the emergence of HIV/AIDS in which there was no treatment, and community organizations could only focus on symptom management and social activism to push for a cure. Once treatment was discovered and approved, it was sold for an extraordinary price. In 1989, AZT was the most expensive prescription drug in history.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/08/28/opinion/azt-s-inhuman-cost.html | title=AZT's Inhuman Cost| journal=The New York Times| date=1989-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Very few patients could afford to be treated or remain on the treatment for the long-term plan that was necessary to sufficiently lower [[Viral load monitoring for HIV|patient's viral loads]].

Many AIDS organizations faced pushback from local communities as fear of [[Gay-related immune deficiency|GRID]] or the gay cancer was rampant and coupled with widespread political, legal, and social discrimination and [[homophobia]].&lt;ref name=aids /&gt; The case of [[Ryan White]] gained enormous media attention due to his experience with community alienation.

There was a huge disparity between resources depending on geographic location within the United States. Organizations stemming from pre-existing LGBT centers were really isolated to urban coastal spaces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url=http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0180544#sec008 | doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0180544| pmid=28692659| pmc=5503273| title=Lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) health services in the United States: Origins, evolution, and contemporary landscape| journal=PLOS ONE| volume=12| issue=7| pages=e0180544| year=2017| last1=Martos| first1=Alexander J.| last2=Wilson| first2=Patrick A.| last3=Meyer| first3=Ilan H.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Community-based health organizations, especially HIV/AIDS organizations are extremely dependent on volunteer labor.&lt;ref name=aj /&gt; 21% of LGBT community organizations rely completely on volunteer labor, and 57% have fewer than five paid staff positions.&lt;ref name=lgbt /&gt;

Another obstacle is the immediacy of need. [[HIV]]/[[AIDS]] is an [[Infection|infectious disease]], therefore treatment is necessary both for the patients own health and wellbeing but also to prevent the spread of the disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.unaids.org/en/resources/presscentre/featurestories/2016/december/20161202_HIV-care | title=The importance of HIV care and support services}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Grand Parade 3.jpg|thumb|270px|An agricultural show parade]]
An '''agricultural show''' is a public event exhibiting the equipment, animals, sports and recreation associated with [[agriculture]] and [[animal husbandry]]. The largest comprise a '''livestock show''' (a judged event or display in which [[selective breeding|breeding stock]] is exhibited), a [[trade fair]], competitions, and entertainment. The work and practices of [[farmer]]s, [[animal fancy|animal fanciers]], [[cowboy]]s, and [[zoologist]]s may be displayed. The terms ''agricultural show'' and ''livestock show'' are synonymous with the North American terms '''county fair''' and '''[[state fair]]'''.

Agricultural shows are an important part of cultural life in small country towns, and a popular event in larger towns and cities. Shows range from small events in small country towns usually lasting two days, through medium-sized events of three days, to large shows, which may run for up to two weeks and combine elements of an [[amusement park]] with those of an agricultural show. Although in many countries agriculture shows are increasingly under financial pressure, many towns or areas have a show society and in some areas, several towns and villages in the area all have an annual show. Larger shows often include live entertainment and fireworks in the main arena.

The first known agricultural show was held by Salford Agricultural Society, [[Lancashire]], in 1768.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2TEEaCrPiWsC&amp;dq=Robertson%27s+Book+of+Firsts:+Who+Did+What+For+the+First+Time&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=C1QjUpCfHbCg7AaoqIDoDA&amp;ved=0CD4Q6AEwAA|title=Robertson's Book of Firsts: Who Did What for the First Time|author=Patrick Robertson

{{toclimit|3}}

==Events==
[[File:MidSomerset Show 170803.jpg|thumb|Cheddar cheese competition.]]
Since the 19th century, agricultural shows have provided local people with an opportunity to celebrate achievements and enjoy a break from day-to-day routine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aso.gov.au/titles/collections/agricultural-shows/|title=Collection - Agricultural shows on ASO - Australia's audio and visual heritage online|author=|date=|website=aso.gov.au}}&lt;/ref&gt; With a combination of serious competition and light entertainment, annual shows acknowledged and rewarded the hard work and skill of primary producers and provided a venue for rural families to socialise. City shows also provide city people with an opportunity to engage directly with rural life and food production.&lt;ref name="nma.gov.au"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nma.gov.au/collections/highlights/agricultural_medals|title=David Allen agricultural medals - National Museum of Australia|author=|date=|website=www.nma.gov.au}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Agriculture shows are often enlivened with competitive events, including [[sheaf toss]]ing, [[show jumping]], food competitions, and [[tent pegging]]. [[Demolition Derby]]s and [[rodeo]]s are popular in the US and [[campdrafting]] and [[wood chopping]] are often held in Australia.

[[Stud (animal)|Stud]]s are generally available for a fee.

===Livestock shows===
{{main|Livestock show}}
[[File:RAS judging the Border Leicesters.jpg|thumb|left|Border Leicesters lined up for the judge]]
A livestock show is an event where [[livestock]] are exhibited and judged on certain [[phenotype|phenotypical]] [[breed]] traits as specified by their respective [[breed standard]]. Species of livestock that may be shown include [[Domestic pig|pig]]s, [[cattle]], [[Domestic sheep|sheep]], [[Domestic goat|goat]]s, [[horse show|horse]]s, [[rabbit]]s, [[llama]]s, and [[alpaca]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Storey's Illustrated Breed Guide to Sheep, Goats, Cattle and Pigs |last=Ekarius |first=Carol |year=2008 |publisher=[[Storey Publishing]] |isbn=978-1-60342-036-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Poultry]] such as [[chicken]]s, [[Domestic goose|geese]], [[Domestic duck|ducks]], [[Domestic turkey|turkeys]], and [[Domestic Pigeon|pigeons]] are also shown competitively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ekarius |first=Carol |title=Storey's Illustrated Guide to Poultry Breeds |year=2007 |publisher=[[Storey Publishing]] |isbn=978-1-58017-667-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also competitive shows for [[Conformation show|dogs]], [[sheepdog trial|sheepdogs]], and [[Cat show|cats]].

Prize-winners at agricultural shows are generally awarded inscribed medals, cups, rosettes or ribbons. The [[National Museum of Australia]] has a rare collection of medals documenting the history of agricultural shows and rural industries across Australia.&lt;ref name="nma.gov.au"/&gt; The 111 medals range in date from the mid-19th to the early 20th century and many are associated with significant individuals and organizations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nma.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0007/324781/Agricultural_medals.pdf David Allen collection agricultural medals purchased by the National Museum - images and details]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Field days===
Related to a show is the "field day", with elements of a [[trade show]] for machinery, equipment and skills required for [[broadacre]] farming. Field days typically do not involve livestock, showbags or [[sideshow]]s, but may include events such as [[ploughing]] competitions not usually associated with shows due to the larger space required. In some communities in northern England Field Days (or [[Club Days]]) have lost their agricultural character and have become community celebrations.

The events are good sources of agricultural information, as organizers can arrange for guest speakers to talk on a range of topics, such as the talk on the yellow-flowering [[alfalfa]] at the South Dakota field day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Yellow-flowering alfalfa topic of June 26 field day |publisher=High Plains Midwest Ag Journal |url=http://www.hpj.com/archives/2008/jun08/jun23/Yellow-floweringalfalfatopi.cfm?title=Yellow-flowering%20alfalfa%20topic%20of%20June%2026%20field%20day |accessdate=21 June 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5YjLsKKT7?url=http://www.hpj.com/archives/2008/jun08/jun23/Yellow-floweringalfalfatopi.cfm?title=Yellow-flowering%20alfalfa%20topic%20of%20June%2026%20field%20day |archivedate=21 June 2008 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pecan]] growers were given a talk on insect control by an entomologist at a recent field day at LSU AgCenter’s Pecan Research/Extension Station in Shreveport, La.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last =Van Osdell | first =Mary Ann| title =Pecan field day provides latest information | publisher =Delta Farm Press | url =http://deltafarmpress.com/news/pecan-fieldday-0620/ | accessdate =21 June 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Landcare (organisation)|Landcare]] survey conducted in 1992/93 revealed that [[field days in Australia]] have a high value among local farmers.&lt;ref name="rural"&gt;{{cite book |title=Rural Land Degradation in Australia |last=Conacher |first=Arthur |authorlink= |author2=Conacher, Jeanette |year=1995 |publisher=Oxford University Press Australia |location=South Melbourne, Victoria |isbn=0-19-553436-0 |page=138 }}&lt;/ref&gt; New Zealand's [[National Agricultural Fieldays]] is held annually in June at [[Mystery Creek Events Centre|Mystery Creek]], near [[Hamilton, New Zealand]], and attracts 1,000 exhibitors and over 115,000 visitors through its gates.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fieldays.co.nz/ Fieldays] Retrieved on 29 November 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Smaller shows, held annually in New Zealand's towns and communities, are generally called ''agricultural and pastoral shows'' ('''A&amp;P shows''').

After all the necessary organizational changes, ARCS became the largest and the most competent humanitarian organization, which aims at support the vulnerable social groups, help disaster victims and distribute humanitarian ideas in the society, as well as implement other activities for the benefit of people, provided by law, regardless of nationality, racial, gender, religious and class affiliations and political views.

==History==

Red Cross humanitarian mission started activities in Armenia back in 1877, when in the Erivan province Finnish Red Cross hospitals were established, as well as in 1896, when American Red Cross volunteer Clara Barton was providing assistance to Armenian population doomed to disaster under Ottoman Turkish rule. Red Cross history shows that in a chronological sense formation of National Societies very often coincides with the country's being in a military actions, and this is logical, because the Red Cross was originally designed to urgently assist sick and wounded soldiers. In this regard the formation of the Armenian Red Cross Society was not an exception.

1920 ... It was a difficult period of time for the country, fight for independence. On the one hand poor agriculture and industry, on the other hand, war that resulted many refugees from Western Armenia. Hunger, squalor, disease, mottled, typhoid, cholera, malaria, dysentery were taking many lives.

And regardless of the fact, that numerous and diverse problems facing the newly independent state, to have such a structure as the Red Cross was not so easy, however, a group of social workers with the help of doctor, scientist, public figure Spandarat Kamsarakan, established Armenian Red Cross National Society. On 19 March in 1920 Parliament of the First Republic of Armenia approved the charter and the company was named as "Red Cross Society of Armenia ".

From the first day of its existence, the newly established Red Cross Society of Armenia, despite limited conditions, started the difficult task of healing the sufferings. With minor conditions the company managed to open a hospital in Keshishkend (now Eghegnadzor), medical point and grocery in Norashen. Red Cross activists did a lot in the battlefront, where they had delivered invaluable aid to sick and wounded soldiers.

However, Red Cross Society of Armenia, as well as the independent Republic of Armenia, did not have a long life. On 29 of November in 1920 The Soviet regime was established, and as number of institutions in independent Armenia, Red Cross Society of Armenia also has temporarily stopped its activities.

On 15 October in 1921, the Council of People's Commissars signed an agreement, according to which Armenia Red Cross Society activities were marked as very important, and was decided to resume the activities of the Society. And in May 1922 the charter of the Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic (ASSR) Red Cross Society was again reaffirmed and decided for the support of the activities and its regulations of the company to provide 5% of a general tax, 15% of foreign passports formulations, 2% of the income of leisure facilities and donations received from abroad.

Thus, with the use of government patronage and public and trade union organizations support, Armenian Soviet Red Cross Society first began to work by organizing material aid for refugees and orphans. It helped to immigrants refugees from Turkey, orphans, and by its own means opened orphanages for 100 children in Yerevan and Ejmiatsin, children's health care services, opened clinics and hospitals. Great achievements for the company were the first nursing courses, later was created a two-year nursing school.

In 1925 creates the Soviet Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies Association, which represents the interests of National Societies before the Soviet government, coordinates various activities of companies within its composition. Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies of Soviet Union consisted of Russian, Ukrainian, Georgian, Armenian Red Cross Societies and Azerbaijan, Uzbekistan Red Crescent Societies.

The Great Patriotic War broke the rhythm of life. The frontline and fight back were fighting with the "everything for front, everything for victory" slogan. During all years of war Armenia Red Cross Society has provided an invaluable service for the protection of the country and sick and wounded soldiers. The company supported immigrant families and orphaned children. Hundreds of Red Cross volunteers were helping the wounded, taking care of orphans health and education. Thousand members of the company were taking part in the volunteer works.

After the end of the war new problems appeared. It was necessary to strengthen the company and help healthcare bodies, engross the ranks of donors, to help the citizens to find relatives that were lost during the war. ARCS members many worthy things have done, and many of them were awarded. The company had about six hundred thousand members; it means that every fourth citizen of Republic was a member of the Red Cross Society.

December 1988 ... The earthquake struck around the world, 25,000 dead, 19,000 wounded, destroyed homes, schools and hospitals. Earthquake destroyed 40% of Armenia's territory of about 1 million population. In the evening of December 8 the first plane of Red Cross arrived to Armenia.

The earthquake in 1988 left its unprecedented impact on ARCS restructuring and development. In the disaster zone began major humanitarian investments. A lot of international humanitarian organizations began their activities in Armenia.

The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (that time - League), in particular, did its most contribution concerning the disaster during its entire existence. Huge activities showed Soviet Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies Union, which with its relief programs, one of the firsts rushed to the disaster zone. Number of Red Cross National Societies started participate quite active. These and other similar organizations carried out their activities through Armenian Red Cross Society (ARCS).

Just 10 days after the earthquake, was made a decision to build the post-traumatic rehabilitation center in Yerevan that will serve for disabled people suffering from spinal injuries. In August 1992 the new center putted into operation-equipped with modern facilities, with the highest international standards, the only one in the former Soviet Union, which was built by the help of Red Cross 26 National Societies and 6 governments.

The center continues its work till today, where a lot of disabled have received and continue to receive treatment. Now the main activities of the center are spinal cord, spine, treatment of diseases of the locomotive apparatus, general and posttraumatic recovery, patient’s vocational training, psychosocial rehabilitation, sanatorium-spa treatment. It also takes a huge amount of work for teaching the disabled craft. These activities help the disabled integrate into society as quickly as possible and become its full members.

The '''Armor Modeling and Preservation Society''' (AMPS) is a [[social club]] with the common interest of [[Plastic model|modeling]] miniature [[armored fighting vehicles]], [[military]] [[model figure]]s, [[Ammunition#Ordnance ammunition|ordnance]], [[dioramas]], and related equipment and promotion of historic military vehicle restoration. AMPS is an international club headquartered in the United States

==History and purpose==
[[File:Amps 2006 tanker museum.JPG|thumb|Several AMPS members talking with a museum volunteer in front of a [[World War II]]-vintage [[Sherman tank]].]]

Clubs centered around the hobby of modeling have existed since the 1950s. The Armor Modeling and Preservation Society, Inc. was founded in 1993 by armor modelers as a means of promoting the hobby using the 'open system' of contest judging.

AMPS was formed as a membership club to promote the hobby of armor modeling, with bylaws that prevented any officer from deriving their income from the hobby of military vehicle modeling. The club operated without [[Incorporation (business)|incorporation]] until early 2007, when it was incorporated as a [[not-for-profit corporation]] in the state of [[New York (state)|New York]]. In 2011 AMPS gained recognition from the US federal government as a 501(c)(4) tax-exempt organization.

AMPS has several purposes: 
*The first is a social function, providing a means for those interested in the hobby of [[model military vehicle]] building (including [[model figure]] building as well as [[diorama]] building) and restoration to associate with other hobbyists. 
*A second is educational; AMPS events and publications provide detailed historical information on actual [[armored fighting vehicles]], ordnance, and the history of their usage, as well as providing techniques for improving scale models, figures and dioramas. 
*Finally, AMPS provides some funding for restoration of actual military vehicles and makes charitable contributions to morale-building efforts for service members serving in combat areas (see below).

==Structure and membership==
[[File:2008AMPSnationalshow.jpg|thumb|The model display area at the 2008 AMPS International convention.]]
The AMPS bylaws and constitution provide for an Executive Board consisting of a President, First Vice-President, eight regional Second Vice Presidents, and a Secretary. Additional non-elected officers include Treasurer, Publications Editor, and Marketing Director/Public Information Officer, Web Master and Chief Judge. The founder and first President of AMPS was Steven "Cookie" Sewell. The current president is John Charvat.

Membership is open to anyone with an interest in the hobby. Annual membership fees are $30 for members in the [[United States]], $35 in [[Canada]] and $40 in other countries. Almost all members are located in the USA, Canada, the UK and Mexico. Currently, AMPS has just over 700 members.

=== Benefits of membership ===
Membership in AMPS gives the modelers several benefits: 
:a) Voting rights in the society. AMPS members vote on officers and thus the direction of the society.
:b) Discounted admission to all AMPS shows. 
:c) Discounted pricing from numerous armor-modeling-related firms who have partnered with AMPS.
:d) Six issues per year of the society journal, '''Boresight'''.

==Publications==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:StykerCover.JPG|thumb|A sample cover of the AMPS journal, ''Boresight''.]] --&gt;

AMPS publishes a semi-monthly journal, ''Boresight''. Articles in ''Boresight'' are written by the members, and the publication itself is edited by volunteers. The journal typically provides several articles on real armored vehicles for reference purposes, along with modeling articles and how-to guides. AMPS accepts advertising in ''Boresight'' as a means of providing discounted hobby products to its members. Initially the publication was produced in a black and white format, the magazine is now a professionally produced publication an all color format.

AMPS also has an official society Facebook page at https://www.facebook.com/AMPSArmor/

==Events==
[[File:Amps 2006 judging area.JPG|thumb|The "Judging Pit" in which model entries are evaluated; this example is at the AMPS 2006 International Convention]]

[[File:Armor Modeling and Preservation Society table (IPMS-USA National Convention, Anaheim 2007).jpg|thumb|AMPS informational table at the IPMS-USA National convention, Anaheim California, Aug 2007]]
The major event hosted by AMPS is the annual '''International Convention''', held each April. This three-day show brings together hundreds of members and non-members to view models, participate in a model contest, buy hobby products, view actual military vehicles, and attend seminars. Recent international conventions have included over 500 scale models on display. The most recent international show was held April 7–9, 2016 in Sumter, South Carolina.&lt;ref&gt;Boresight, May/June 2016, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; Seminar speakers usually include tank crew veterans, well-known modelers and researchers, and industry representatives from firms such as [[Tamiya Corporation|Tamiya]] and [[AFV Club]]. The 2010 show was the most successful AMPS show ever with 634 models entered as well as club display tables.

Smaller regional and local contests are also held from time to time, typically attracting 100+ scale models for single-day events. 
*AMPS East is an East Coast USA show, held annually since 1999, normally in the western Connecticut (in recent years) or northern New Jersey (formerly) area. 
*AMPS Centex is a midwest show held in Austin, Texas every other year. 
*Kansas City AMPS holds a show every October in Kansas City, Missouri. 
*AMPS Atlanta holds a show each February since 2009. 
*Central Virginia AMPS has held three regionals in the Richmond, Virginia area

The scale models entered in the contest are judged according to the AMPS Contest Rules, and may be awarded Gold, Silver or Bronze medals. Scale models are judged for accuracy, level of detail, skill in construction, and paint/markings finish. Some of these models take hundreds of hours to complete. Each modeler is provided with a feedback form showing the points given in each area and what areas need to improve. An 'open' system of judging is used in which each model competes against a standard, not against other entries. Thus, instead of 1st, 2nd and 3rd-place medals, awards are given to all models that reach specified cutoff scores. Since participants are not competing against one another, there is no disincentive to the sharing of techniques and ideas.

The feedback provided in these events is a key factor in helping modelers improve. The AMPS system provides formal feedback, giving specific information about what to improve in the model.

===AMPS Masters===
An 'AMPS Master' is a modeler who has either won "Best of Show" at the AMPS convention or who is recognized by AMPS as a Master-level modeler due to other accomplishments.&lt;ref&gt;Boresight, May/June 2016, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Assyrians/Syriacs in Sweden''' ({{lang-sv|Assyrier/Syrianer}}) are citizens and residents of [[Sweden]] who are of [[Assyrian people|Assyrian]] (also known as Chaldean or Syriac) descent, there are approximately 150,000 Assyrians in Sweden.&lt;ref&gt; https://www.svt.se/nyheter/lokalt/sodertalje/statministerns-folkmordsbesked-kan-avgora-kommunvalet-underskatta-inte-fragan &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aina.org/aol/peter/brief.htm#1918]&lt;/ref&gt;

Assyrians/Syriacs first came to Sweden from [[Lebanon]] for work in the late 1960s when Europe needed laborers for its industries. However, with increased ethnic and religious persecution in their [[Assyrian homeland|homeland]], which is located in present-day southeastern [[Turkey]], northern [[Iraq]], northwestern [[Iran]] and northeastern [[Syria]],&lt;ref name="Donabed2015"&gt;{{cite book|author=Sargon Donabed|title=Reforging a Forgotten History: Iraq and the Assyrians in the Twentieth Century|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bwLdCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT18|date=1 February 2015|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|isbn=978-0-7486-8605-6|pages=18–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Assyrian immigration to Sweden increased. Those who had lived in Sweden for a longer period of time were granted residency for humanitarian reasons given the conflicts in their place of origin.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sweden.gov.se/content/1/c6/02/25/95/e7730215.pdf Swedish Minister for Development Co-operation, Migration and Asylum Policy, Migration 2002, June 2002] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060926110338/http://www.sweden.gov.se/content/1/c6/02/25/95/e7730215.pdf |date=September 26, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Södertälje Municipality|Södertälje]] is seen as the unofficial Assyrian/Syriac [[Capital (political)|capital]] of [[Europe]] due to the city's high percentage of Assyrians/Syriacs. According to Assyrian organization estimates, there are approximately 150,000 Assyrians in Sweden.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aina.org/aol/peter/brief.htm#1918]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Syriac Orthodox Christians (Middle East)|Syriac Orthodox Christians]] number an estimated 30–40,000 people (2016), while higher estimations is 70–80,000, out of which an estimated 18,000 live in Södertälje.&lt;ref name="ShahFoblets2016"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Prakash Shah|author2=Marie-Claire Foblets|title=Family, Religion and Law: Cultural Encounters in Europe|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6PYGDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA183|date=15 April 2016|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-13648-4|p=183|quote=Syriac Orthodox}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The first Assyrians arrived in 1967 from [[Lebanon]], numbering some 200 people.&lt;ref name="WizeliusHansson1984"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Tore Wizelius|author2=Lars-Sune Hansson|author3=Sweden. Referensgruppen för folkrörelsefrågor|author4=Sweden. Statens invandrarverk|title=Föreningar bland invandrare och minoriteter i Sverige|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IIAwAAAAYAAJ|year=1984|publisher=Statens invandrarverk|p=53}}&lt;/ref&gt; The migration to Sweden may be broken up into a number of distinct periods. The first group consisted of those that came to work at Swedish manufacturing plants, such as [[Scania]]. There were then the subsequent waves after the [[Turkish invasion of Cyprus]] in 1974, The [[Lebanese Civil War]] in 1975, the rise of [[Ba'athism|Baathism]] in Iraq &amp; Syria, the [[Iranian Revolution]] of 1979, and more recently, from Iraq and Syria as a result of the Iraq Wars ([[Gulf War]] in 1991, [[Iraq War]] in 2003, [[Iraqi Civil War (2014–present)|Iraqi Civil War]] in 2014–present) and the [[Syrian Civil War]] in 2011–present.

==Identity==
There is an ideological division of this group in Sweden between&lt;ref&gt;Dan Lundberg, ''Christians from the Middle East'' {{year|date=October 2015}} {{page needed|date=October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Aramaeanism|Aramaenists]], [[Syriac Orthodox Christians (Middle East)|adherents]] of the [[Syriac Orthodox Church]] ([[West Syrian Rite]]) who insist on the name ''Syrianer'' and an "[[Aramaeans|Aramaean]]" heritage for the group.
*[[Assyrianism|Assyrianists]] of various denominational backgrounds, who de-emphasize religious adherence in favor of [[nationalism and ancient history|pre-Christian antiquity]], who insist on the name ''Assyrier'' and an [[Assyrian Empire|Assyrian]] heritage for the group.
To account for this division, official Swedish sources refer to the group as "Assyrier/Syrianer",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Riksdagens protokoll|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Sla-WtYr_BwC|year=2001|publisher=Kungl.

The Swedish authorities have granted many rights for Assyrian including their own professional [[football (soccer)]] teams like [[Assyriska FF]] and [[Syrianska FC]]. Also, the Swedish authorities have granted the right of Assyrians to broadcast international TV-channels like [[Suryoyo Sat]] and [[Suroyo TV]] from the Swedish territory.

'''Awakatek''' is a [[Mayan language]] spoken in [[Guatemala]], primarily in [[Huehuetenango Department|Huehuetenango]] and around [[Aguacatán]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cabral |first=Ernesto Díaz Couder |year=2001 |title=Culturas e interculturalidad en Guatemala |url=http://www.relint.deusto.es/ALFA_EPI/documentos/Culturas%20e%20interculturalidad%20en%20Guatemala%5B1%5D.16-5-02.doc |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100215201714/http://www.relint.deusto.es/ALFA_EPI/documentos/Culturas%20e%20interculturalidad%20en%20Guatemala%5B1%5D.16-5-02.doc |archivedate=2010-02-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The language only has around 9000 speakers, and is considered vulnerable by UNESCO. In addition, the language in [[Mexico]] is critically endangered, with only 3 elderly speakers left as of 2000.&lt;ref name="unesco"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/languages-atlas/index.php|title=UNESCO Atlas of the World's Languages in danger|website=www.unesco.org|language=en|access-date=2017-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Awakatek is closely related to [[Ixil language|Ixil]] and the two languages together form the sub-branch Ixilean, which together with the Mamean languages, [[Mam language|Mam]] and [[Tektitek language|Tektitek]], form a sub-branch Greater-Mamean, which again, together with the Greater-Quichean languages, ten Mayan languages, including [[K'iche' language|K'iche']], form the branch Quichean–Mamean.

The [[Awakatek people]] themselves refer to their language as ''qa'yol'', literally meaning ''our word''.

'''Unity of humanity''' is one of the central teachings of the '''[[Bahá'í Faith]]'''.&lt;ref name="Stockman"&gt;{{Harvnb|Stockman|2000|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Bahá'í teachings]] state that since all humans have been created in the image of God, God does not make any distinction between people regardless of [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]] or [[Human skin colour|colour]].&lt;ref name="Smith138"&gt;{{Harvnb|Smith|2008|p=138}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, because all humans have been created equal, they all require equal opportunities and treatment.&lt;ref name="Stockman"/&gt; Thus the Bahá'í view promotes the unity of humanity, and that people's vision should be world-embracing and that people should love the whole world rather than just their nation.&lt;ref name="Smith138"/&gt; The teaching, however, does not equal unity with uniformity, but instead the Bahá'í writings advocate for the principle of ''unity in diversity'' where the variety in the human race is valued.&lt;ref name="Smith139"&gt;{{Harvnb|Smith|2008|p=139}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Oneness==
The Bahá'í teaching of the ''unity of [[humankind|humanity]]'' (also known as the ''oneness of humanity'') stems from the teaching that all humans have been created equal in the image of God, and that God does not make any distinction between people.&lt;ref name="Smith138"/&gt; The teaching emphasizes the unity of humanity transcending all divisions of [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]], [[nation]], [[gender]], [[caste]], and [[social class]], while celebrating its diversity.&lt;ref name="Hatcher75"&gt;{{Harvnb|Hatcher|Martin|1998|p=75}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Bahá'í writings states that since the human race is one unified organic unit, all people have the same basic capacities, and that the physical differences, such as skin colour, are superficial and do not make one ethnic group superior to another.&lt;ref name="Hatcher75"/&gt;

In the Bahá'í view, humanity has always constituted one group, but that ignorance, prejudice and power-seeking have prevented the recognition of the oneness of humanity.&lt;ref name="Hatcher76"&gt;{{Harvnb|Hatcher|Martin|1998|p=76}}&lt;/ref&gt; The historical differences that have existed between different ethnic groups is attributable to differences in education and cultural opportunities over a long-term, as well as to racial prejudice and oppression.&lt;ref name="Hatcher75"/&gt;

===Unity in diversity===
In the Bahá'í view, unity does not equal uniformity, but instead the Bahá'í writings advocate for the principle of [[unity in diversity]] where the variety in the human race is valued.&lt;ref name="Smith139"/&gt; [[`Abdu'l-Bahá]], the son of the founder of the religion, compared the human race to a [[flower]] garden where the garden was made more beautiful by its diversities of colour and form.&lt;ref name="Smith139"/&gt;

{{quote|The world of humanity is like unto a rose garden and the various races, tongues and people are like unto contrasting flowers. The diversity of colors in a rose-garden adds to the charm and beauty of the scene as variety enhances unity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|`Abdu'l-Bahá|1918|p=183}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The Bahá'í writings note that unity will not be arrived at through the suppression of difference, but instead when each respects the intrinsic value of other individuals and cultures.  In this view, it is not the diversity that causes conflict, but rather people's intolerance and prejudice towards diversity.&lt;ref name="Hatcher78"&gt;{{Harvnb|Hatcher|Martin|1998|p=78}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cultural norms in the religion have gone through major transitions.&lt;ref name="Christchurch"&gt;{{Cite book| last = Momen | first = Moojan |editor-last = McGlinn | editor-first = Sen | title = Soundings: Essays in Bahá'í Theology | publisher = : Open Circle Publishing | chapter =Is the Baha'i Faith a World Religion? | chapterurl =http://bahai-library.com/?id=4058 | year = 1989 | location = Christchurch, NZ | pages = 55–64 | url = |isbn = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the later 1930s and 1940s Bahá'ís in the West began a systematic implementation of the [[Tablets of the Divine Plan]] towards Latin America.&lt;ref name="alamb"&gt;{{cite book | last = Lamb | first = Artemus | title = The Beginnings of the Bahá'í Faith in Latin America:Some Remembrances, English Revised and Amplified Edition | publisher = M L VanOrman Enterprises |date=November 1995 | location = West Linn, OR | url =http://bahai-library.com/books/latinamerica.lamb.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title = Latin American Administration Develops |magazine= Bahá'í News |date=July 1947 | number = 197 | page =3 | url =http://bahai-news.info/viewer.erb?vol=02&amp;page=1003}}&lt;/ref&gt; At a certain stage of the process regional coordinating committees were appointed and a stated purpose for them was to facilitate a shift in the balance of roles from North American leading guidance and Latin cooperation to Latin leading guidance and North American cooperation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title = Historical Background of the Panama Temple|magazine= Bahá'í News |date=April 1972 | number = 493 | page =2 | url = http://bahai-news.info/viewer.erb?vol=08&amp;page=50}}&lt;/ref&gt; The process was well underway by 1950 and was to be enforced about 1953. By 1961 most Latin and South American countries had their own national assembly.&lt;ref name="Custodians"&gt;{{cite book|author= Rabbani, Ruhiyyih (Ed.) |authorlink=Rúhíyyih Khanum |year= 1992 |title= The Ministry of the Custodians 1957-1963 |publisher= Bahá'í World Centre |page=256|isbn= 0-85398-350-X |url= http://bahai-library.com/?file=uhj_ministry_custodians.html&amp;chapter=7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; See [[Bahá'í Faith in Central America|Bahá'í Faith in Latin America]]. Almost in parallel with this process in the West in the East Bahá'ís in India were embarking on a comparable process. The Bahá'í message had for decades been primarily addressed to Indian Muslims and Parsees (Zoroastrians), a re-interpretation of the Bahá'í message in accordance with Hindu ideas was undertaken to reach the masses of Hindus.&lt;ref name="garlington"&gt;{{Cite journal| last = Garlington |first = William | title = The Baha'i Faith in India: A Developmental Stage Approach | journal = Occasional Papers in Shaykhi, Babi and Baha'i Studies |issue = 2 | date = June 1997 | url =http://www.h-net.org/~bahai/bhpapers/india1.htm | issn = | accessdate = 2010-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="garlington-bhajans"&gt;{{Cite journal| last =  Garlington | first = William | title = The Baha'i Bhajans: An example of the Baha'i Use of Hindu Symbols | journal = Occasional Papers in Shaykhi, Babi and Baha'i Studies | volume = 02 | issue = 1 | date = January 1998 | url =http://www.h-net.org/~bahai/bhpapers/vol2/india2.htm | issn = | accessdate = 2010-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; In two more years almost as many people converted as had been Bahá'ís through regions of [[Madhya Pradesh]], [[Uttar Pradesh]], [[Andhra Pradesh]] and [[Gujarat]]. By 1970 there were 3,350 assemblies and over 312,000 believers.&lt;ref name="garlington"/&gt; See [[Bahá'í Faith in India]].

While those early processes continued locally international attention shifted to Africa for Bahá'ís in the West and East. In Africa there was widespread conversions to the religion following the 1950s.&lt;ref name="UofC"&gt;{{cite web|title=Overview Of World Religions |work=General Essay on the Religions of Sub-Saharan Africa |publisher=Division of Religion and Philosophy, [[University of Cumbria]] |url=http://philtar.ucsm.ac.uk/encyclopedia/sub/geness.html |accessdate=2008-04-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071209082606/http://philtar.ucsm.ac.uk/encyclopedia/sub/geness.html |archivedate=2007-12-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was emphasized that pioneers be self-effacing and focus their efforts not on the colonial leadership but on the native Africans&lt;ref name="BN283"&gt;{{cite magazine | title = United States Africa Teaching Committee; Goals for this year |magazine= Bahá'í News |date=September 1954 | number = 283 |pages=10–11 | url = http://bahai-news.info/viewer.erb?vol=04&amp;page=40}}&lt;/ref&gt; - and that the pioneers must show by actions the sincerity of their sense of service to the Africans in bringing the religion and then the Africans who understand their new religion are to be given freedom to rise up and spread the religion according to their own sensibilities and the pioneers to disperse or step into the background. See [[Bahá'í Faith in Africa]].

Since then other examples of this pattern of growing respect for cultures has taken hold in specific instances. Unlike the spread of Christianity within Indian country, in the United States, the Bahá‘í Faith has never been associated with a fortification of colonial occupation, Euro-American assimilation, or forced conversions of Native Americans. Indeed, in 1960 [[Hand of the Cause]] [[Rúhíyyih Khánum]] asked for forgiveness for the injustices her race had done and praised the great past of the native peoples.&lt;ref name="Addison&amp;Buck"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last = Addison | first = Donald Francis | last2 = Buck | first2 = Christopher | title = Messengers of God in North America Revisited: An Exegesis of "Abdu'l-Bahá's Tablet to Amír Khán | journal = Online Journal of Bahá'í Studies | volume = 01 | pages = 180–270 | publisher =  Association for Bahá'í Studies English-Speaking Europe | location = London | year = 2007 | url =http://bahaistudies.net/onlinejournal/OJBS_1_Buck_Addison_MessengersofGod.pdf |issn= 1177-8547 | accessdate = 2009-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; And in 1963 anthropologist [[Alice Beck Kehoe]], a well known researcher of Native Americans, observed that the Bahá‘í Faith is considered by its members to be a universal faith, not tied to any one particular culture, religious background, language, or even country of origin. See [[Bahá'í Faith and Native Americans]]. In Papua New Guinea whereas Christian missionaries openly opposed traditional funerary art and performances, the Bahá'ís encouraged their production as a form of worship. Thus while [[Nalik culture|Nalik]] Bahá'ís are regarded by other Naliks as arbiters of traditional knowledge and practices, the Christian missions and their followers are seen as antagonistic to [[kastom]].&lt;ref name="were"&gt;{{cite journal | last =Were |first = Graeme | title =Thinking through images:''Katom''and the coming of the Baha'is to Northern New Ireland, Papua New Guinea | journal =Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute | volume =11 | issue =4| pages =659–676 | year =2005 | url =http://www.nhbahais.com/BahaiPapers/newguinea.pdf | accessdate = December 11, 2012 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-9655.2005.00256.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; See [[Bahá'í Faith in Papua New Guinea]].

===Elimination of prejudice===
One of the main principles of the Bahá'í Faith that comes about from the unity of humanity is the elimination of all forms of [[prejudice]], and it entails non-discrimination against individuals on such things like race, [[Bahá'í Faith and the unity of religion|religion]], [[Bahá'í Faith and gender equality|gender]] or class.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Chryssides|1999|p=250}}&lt;/ref&gt; `Abdu'l-Bahá states that while the challenge is large, social prejudices including religious, political, and patriotic lead to war, and thus the elimination of prejudice was essential for human well-being.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Smith|2000|pp=275–276}}&lt;/ref&gt; In that regard, the Bahá'í teachings state that the elimination of all forms of prejudice is a fundamental requirement to achieve world unity and [[peace]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|McMullen|2003|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two prime examples of this in action exist - one comes from the American South, and the other from South Africa. Arriving in the face of the rise of [[Jim Crow laws]] and the rise of the [[Ku Klux Klan]] as a broad-based national movement and in contrast to Protestant, Catholic and Jewish organizations in South Carolina, the Bahá’ís explicitly promoted racial integration from the local level up.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite thesis | last =Venters, III| first =Louis E. | title =Most great reconstruction: The Baha'i Faith in Jim Crow South Carolina, 1898-1965 | publisher = Colleges of Arts and Sciences University of South Carolina | year = 2010 |url =http://bahai-library.com/venters_bahai_south_carolina | isbn =  978-1-243-74175-2 | id = UMI Number: 3402846| pages = v, 4, 150, 297 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Called by the scriptures of their faith to “associate with all the peoples and kindreds of the earth with joy and radiance,” they deliberately sought converts from diverse backgrounds, forging bonds of shared religious identity across traditional social boundaries even when their meetings were raided. By the end of the twentieth century, the Bahá’í Faith was the largest non-Christian religion in South Carolina, and it was well known for its longstanding commitment to promoting racial harmony, interfaith dialogue, and the moral education of children and youth. In South Africa, faced with the segregated social pattern and laws of [[South Africa under apartheid|Apartheid]], the integrated population of Bahá'ís had to decide how to be composed in their administrative structures &amp;ndash; whether the National Spiritual Assembly would be all black or all white. The Bahá'í community decided that instead of dividing the South African Bahá'í community into two population groups, one black and one white, they instead limited membership in the [[Bahá'í administration]] to black adherents, and placed the entire Bahá'í community under the leadership of its black population.&lt;ref name="conference"&gt;{{cite conference  | author = Truth and Reconciliation Commission of South Africa Report

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Abhorring all forms of [[prejudice]] and rejecting any system of [[Racial segregation|segregation]], the Bahá'í Faith was introduced on a one-to-one basis and the community quietly grew during the apartheid years, without publicity.  Despite the nature of the politics of that time, we presented our [[Bahá'í teachings|teachings]] on unity and the oneness of humankind to prominent individuals in politics, commerce and academia and leaders of thought including State Presidents.... [b]oth individual Bahá'ís and our administrative institutions were continually watched by the security police.... Our activities did not include opposition to the previous Government for involvement in partisan politics and opposition to government are explicitly prohibited by the sacred Texts of our Faith.... During the time when the previous Government prohibited integration within our communities, rather than divide into separate administrative structures for each population group, we opted to limit membership of the Bahá'í Administration to the black adherents who were and remain in the majority of our membership and thereby placed the entire Bahá'í community under the stewardship of its black membership.... The pursuit of our objectives of unity and equality has not been without costs.  The "white" Bahá'ís were often ostracized by their white neighbours for their association with "non-whites". The Black Bahá'ís were subjected to scorn by their black compatriots for their lack of political action and their complete integration with their white Bahá'í brethren.  The most tragic loss to our community was the brutal execution of four of our adherents, at our places of worship, three in [[Mdantsane]] and one in [[Umtata]].&lt;ref name="conference"/&gt;&lt;ref name="strc" /&gt;&lt;ref name="trcsa"/&gt;&lt;ref name="shooting"&gt;{{cite news   | last = Reber  | first = Pat  | title = Baha'i Church Shooting Verdicts in  | publisher = South Africa Associated Press  | date = 1999-05-02  | url = http://bahai-library.com/newspapers/1999/031599-1.html  | accessdate = 2008-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Political unity==
An essential mission in [[Bahá'u'lláh|Bahá'u'lláh's]], the founder of the Bahá'í Faith, teachings was to bring about a consciousness in the peoples of the world regarding the oneness of humankind.&lt;ref name="Hatcher76"/&gt; However, Bahá'u'lláh stated that along with the increase in individual and [[collective consciousness]] of the oneness of humanity, new social structures are also needed for the oneness of humanity to be achieved.&lt;ref name="Hatcher78"/&gt; He wrote:&lt;ref name="Hatcher78"/&gt;

{{quote|It is not for him to pride himself who loveth his own country, but rather for him who loveth the whole world.  The earth is but one country, and Mankind its citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bahá'u'lláh|1976|pp=249–250}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The Bahá'í teachings thus state that it is not sufficient that humanity acknowledge its oneness and still live in a disunited world that contains prejudice and conflict.&lt;ref name="Hatcher77"&gt;{{Harvnb|Hatcher|Martin|1998|p=77}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Bahá'í belief, humanity has gone through a process of [[Progressive revelation (Bahá'í)|progressive revelation]] through various different [[Manifestations of God|messengers of God]], including [[Buddha]], [[Moses]], [[Jesus]], [[Muhammad]] and others, where humanity has grown collectively.&lt;ref name="Hatcher76"/&gt; In this belief, society has been steadily organizing itself with higher levels of unity through the various messengers of God; going from the unity of the family, the tribe, the city-state and the nation. The Bahá'í writings state that the next stage of the collective growth is that of world unity and the organization of society as a planetary civilization.&lt;ref name="Hatcher76"/&gt; [[Shoghi Effendi]], the head of the Bahá'í Faith in the first half of the 20th century, wrote:&lt;ref name="Hatcher76"/&gt;
 
{{quote|The principle of the Oneness of Mankind &amp;mdash; the pivot round which all the teachings of Bahá'u'lláh revolve &amp;mdash; is no mere outburst of ignorant emotionalism or an expression of vague and pious hope. Its appeal is not to be merely identified with a reawakening of the spirit of brotherhood and good-will among men, nor does it aim solely at the fostering of harmonious cooperation among individual peoples and nations. Its implications are deeper, its claims greater than any which the Prophets of old were allowed to advance. Its message is applicable not only to the individual, but concerns itself primarily with the nature of those essential relationships that must bind all the states and nations as members of one human family. ... It implies an organic change in the structure of present-day society, a change such as the world has not yet experienced. ... It calls for no less than the reconstruction and the demilitarization of the whole civilized world ...&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Effendi|1938|pp=42–43}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Thus in the Bahá'í view, unity must be expressed by building a universal and unified social system that is based on spiritual principles.  In this view, the fundamental purpose of society is spiritual and is to create a society that is favourable to the healthy development of all its peoples.&lt;ref name="Hatcher77"/&gt;

The '''Basque Mountain Horse''' ({{lang-es|'Caballo de Monte del País Vasco'}}, {{lang-eu|{{noitalic|'''Euskal Herriko Mendiko Zaldia'''}}}}) is a breed of horse from the [[Basque Country (greater region)|Basque Country]] of [[Spain]] and [[France]]. It is listed in the Catálogo Oficial de Razas de Ganado de España, the official catalogue of livestock breeds of Spain, in the group of [[wikt:autochthonous|autochthonous]] breeds in danger of extinction.&lt;ref name=magrama/&gt; The original breed standard of the "Euskal Herriko Mendiko Zaldia / Caballo de Monte del País Vasco", officially approved on 21 July 1999 and published in the ''Boletín Oficial del País Vasco'', the official bulletin of the Basque Country, was repealed in 2015 and replaced with a new one.{{r|pinan|standard}}

At the end of 2013 the total number of breeding animals recorded in the herdbook was 4556.&lt;ref name=magrama2/&gt;

== Naming ==

Door games are known in Chinese in mainland China as "games with which to receive the groom" ''{{lang|zh-latn-pinyin|jiēqīn yóuxì}}'' {{nowrap|({{lang|zh|{{linktext|接}}{{linktext|亲}}{{linktext|游戏}}}})}} or "games with which to block the door" ''{{lang|zh-latn-pinyin|dǔmén yóuxì}}'' {{nowrap|({{lang|zh|{{linktext|堵}}{{linktext|门}}{{linktext|游戏}}}})}}.&lt;ref name="Xinhua-48" /&gt; In Hong Kong, the process is known in [[Cantonese]] as "playing with the groom" ({{zh|c={{linktext|玩}}{{linktext|新郎}}|j=wan4 san1 long4|labels=no}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=如何玩新郎而不失面子|date=2016-05-23|url=http://www.bigcouple.hk/%E5%A8%B6%E8%80%81%E5%A9%86%E5%89%8D-%E6%8E%A5%E5%8F%97%E6%8C%91%E6%88%B0/|location=Hong Kong|publisher=BigCouple.hk|language=Chinese|access-date=2017-09-14|trans-title=How to tease the groom without losing face}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Malaysia, these games are called '''''heng dai'' games''', after the Cantonese word referring to the groomsmen ({{zh|c={{linktext|兄弟}}|j=hing1 dai6|l=brothers|labels=no}}),&lt;ref name="worldofbuzz" /&gt; while in Singapore, the process is known as the '''wedding gatecrash'''.&lt;ref name="Nutella" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Leong" /&gt;

== Typical components ==

Before the games start, the groom and groomsmen must first pay a fee in order for the bridesmaids to open the door. It is common for the groom and groomsmen to prepare [[Red envelope|red envelopes]] filled with cash that they use to negotiate with the bridesmaids who guard the door. These amounts are usually in multiples of auspicious numbers, such as the number 8 that signifies wealth, or 9, that signifies a long-lasting union. Groomsmen often will carry ample amounts of red envelopes and try to negotiate with the bridesmaids as to the amount of red envelopes that is required before they agree to open to the door. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.chinese-wedding-guide.com/fetch-the-bride.html&lt;/ref&gt;  

Door games usually include the consumption of unpleasant or strange food or drink.&lt;ref name="Xinhua-48" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Nutella" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hamon" /&gt; In particular, grooms are made to consume foods that are sour, sweet, bitter and spicy ({{zh|c={{linktext|酸甜苦辣}}|p=suāntiánkǔlà|l=joys and sorrows|labels=no}}) in succession, to signify his resolve to weather the joys and sorrows of marriage with his partner.&lt;ref name="Xinhua-48" /&gt; Bitter foods used for this purpose include bitter tea&lt;ref name="bridal-games-sg" /&gt; and [[Momordica charantia|bitter gourd]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.perfectweddings.sg/5-gatecrashing-ideas-for-your-wedding/|title=5 Gatecrashing Ideas For Your Wedding|last=|first=|date=|website=Perfect Weddings|location=Singapore|access-date=2017-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; while spicy foods include [[wasabi]] and [[Bird's eye chili|chilli padi]].&lt;ref name="bridal-games-sg"&gt;{{Citation|title=Bridal games that Singapore grooms play|date=2013-05-12|url=http://www.herworldplus.com/weddings/updates/bridal-games-singapore-grooms-play|newspaper=The Straits Times|location=Singapore|access-date=2017-09-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170116000914/http://www.herworldplus.com/weddings/updates/bridal-games-singapore-grooms-play|archive-date=2017-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, [[Declaration of love|declarations of love]] through words, [[Song|songs]] and [[Poetry|poems]] from the groom may also be requested.&lt;ref name="Xinhua-48" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Viknesh|first=Tashya|title=Hilarious Games For Groomsmen At Chinese Weddings|date=2016-09-28|url=https://www.kaodim.com/blog/2016/09/28/hilarious-games-groomsmen-chinese-weddings/|publisher=Kaodim|access-date=2017-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is not uncommon for door games to also include physical tests, such as [[Push-up|push-ups]],&lt;ref name="intimate" /&gt; and [[cross-dressing]], especially in Malaysia and Singapore.&lt;ref name="bridal-games-sg" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Hew|first=Lee Yee|title=8 Heng Dai Games That Are Popular For All The Wrong Reasons|date=2015-02-10|url=http://says.com:80/my/fun/8-heng-dai-games-that-are-popular-for-all-the-wrong-reasons|location=Malaysia|publisher=SAYS.com|access-date=2017-09-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170124083334/http://says.com/my/fun/8-heng-dai-games-that-are-popular-for-all-the-wrong-reasons|archive-date=2017-01-24|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Contemporary opinions ==

=== Singapore ===

Wedding door games are an opportunity for grooms to demonstrate their resolve and commitment, which some brides appreciate.&lt;ref name="Leong" /&gt; The practice is also seen by some as a valued [[tradition]] and a [[rite of passage]].&lt;ref name="bridal-games-sg" /&gt; Wedding games may also add to the fun and excitement of the wedding.&lt;ref name="bridal-games-sg" /&gt;

However, the prospect of these challenges may induce [[anxiety]] in grooms before the wedding.&lt;ref name="bridal-games-sg" /&gt; In addition, many couples are becoming disillusioned about the meaning provided by such games, noting that the games are humiliating and labour-intensive to prepare.&lt;ref name="intimate" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Joanne|first=Poh|title=4 Things to Cut Out of Your Wedding if You Want to Save a Significant Amount of Cash|date=2017-01-04|url=http://blog.moneysmart.sg:80/wedding/4-things-cut-wedding-want-save-significant-amount-cash/|newspaper=MoneySmart.sg|location=Singapore|publisher=Catapult Ventures Pte Ltd|access-date=2017-09-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170115153743/http://blog.moneysmart.sg/wedding/4-things-cut-wedding-want-save-significant-amount-cash/|archive-date=2017-01-15|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some couples set boundaries on the games, such as excluding [[Innuendo|sexual elements]].&lt;ref name="bridal-games-sg" /&gt; One [[Wedding photography|wedding photographer]] estimated in 2016 that roughly 20% of Singaporean Chinese couples do away with such wedding door games, even while retaining the other elements of a [[Chinese pre-wedding customs|traditional Chinese wedding]].&lt;ref name="intimate" /&gt;

This article is about the [[demographics|demographic]] features of the [[population]] of [[Tuvalu]], including the age structure, [[Ethnic group|ethnicity]], education level, life expectancy, religious affiliations and other aspects of the population.

==Summary of the demographics of Tuvalu==
[[File:Children of Niutao Island.JPG|thumb|right|300px| Children on [[Niutao]]]]
The population of Tuvalu is primarily of [[Polynesia]]n ethnicity with approximately 5.6% of the population being [[Micronesia]]n.&lt;ref name="1C2012"&gt;{{cite web| last = | first =  |title= Population of communities in Tuvalu| publisher=world-statistics.org|chapter=|date =11 April 2012 |url= http://tuvalu.popgis.spc.int/#l=en;i=ethnic.t_tuvaluan;v=map1;sid=39;z=717733,9074628,48863,33709;sly=eas_32760_xy_def_DR | accessdate=20 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tuvalu]]ans are ethnically related to the people of [[Samoa]] and [[Tonga]]. There is evidence for a dual genetic origin of Pacific Islanders in [[Asia]] and [[Melanesia]], which results from an analysis of [[Y chromosome]] (NRY) and [[mitochondrial DNA]] (mtDNA) markers; there is also evidence that [[Fiji]] playing a pivotal role in west-to-east expansion within Polynesia.&lt;ref name=ANT&gt;{{cite web| last=|first= |title = Melanesian and Asian Origins of Polynesians: mtDNA and Y Chromosome Gradients Across the Pacific |work=Anthrocivitas.net|date = October 2009 | url=http://anthrocivitas.net/forum/showthread.php?t=5420| accessdate=23 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The vast majority of Tuvaluans belong to the [[Church of Tuvalu]], a [[Protestant]] denomination. Their ancestors were converted by [[Christian]] missionaries in the 19th century.

Infant mortality in Tuvalu was 25 deaths per 1,000 live births in 2012, with an under-five mortality rate of 30 deaths per 1,000 live births. There has been a consistent decline in the under-five mortality rate since 1990.&lt;ref name="AIDS16"&gt;{{cite web| last = | first = |title= Global AIDS Progress Report of Tuvalu| publisher= Ministry of Health Tuvalu|chapter=|date = 2016|url= http://www.unaids.org/sites/default/files/country/documents/TUV_narrative_report_2016.pdf| accessdate=29 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

School attendance at school is 10 years for males and 11 years for [[Women in Tuvalu|females]] (2001).&lt;ref name ="CIA"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/tv.html|title=The World Factbook (CIA)|date=25 February 2016|accessdate= 20 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adult literacy rate is 99.0% (2002).&lt;ref name="IMF 2010"&gt;{{cite web|title= Tuvalu: 2010 Article IV Consultation-Staff Report; Public Information Notice on the Executive Board Discussion; and Statement by the Executive Director for Tuvalu|url= https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/cat/longres.aspx?sk=24632.0|publisher= International Monetary Fund Country Report No. 11/46|date=8 February 2011|accessdate=4 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Secondary school enrollment (2001): 79.5 percent&lt;ref name="SB2014"/&gt;

Life expectancy for [[women in Tuvalu]] is 68.41 years and 64.01 years for men (2015 est.).&lt;ref name ="CIA"/&gt;

The population of Tuvalu is recorded by the Central Statistics Department (CSD) of Tuvalu in the census information:&lt;ref name=CSD&gt;{{cite web| first=|last=|url= http://www.spc.int/prism/country/tv/stats/Census%20&amp;%20Surveys/Census_index.htm |title= Census of Population and Housing and sample Surveys | year =2006|publisher= Central Statistics Division – Government of Tuvalu |accessdate= 17 Oct 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The net migration rate is estimated at -6.81 migrant(s)/1,000 population (2015 est.).&lt;ref name ="CIA"/&gt; The threat of [[global warming in Tuvalu]] is not a dominant motivation for migration as Tuvaluans appear to prefer to continue living on the islands for reasons of lifestyle, culture and identity.&lt;ref name="CMJB"&gt;{{cite journal |author= Colette Mortreux &amp; Jon Barnett |url= http://web.env.auckland.ac.nz/courses/geog320/resources/pdf/climate/Mortreux%20and%20Barnett%202009.pdf |title= Climate change, migration and adaptation in Funafuti, Tuvalu |journal= Global Environmental Change |volume= 19 |year= 2009 |pages= 105–112 |doi= 10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2008.09.006 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20160131200403/http://web.env.auckland.ac.nz/courses/geog320/resources/pdf/climate/Mortreux%20and%20Barnett%202009.pdf |archivedate= 2016-01-31 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Census Monograph on Migration, Urbanization and Youth provides an analysis of the 2012 census and reported:&lt;ref name="CMMUY"&gt;{{cite web| last = | first =  |title= Tuvalu Population and Housing Census 2012: Migration, Urbanisation and Youth Monograph| publisher= Central Statistics Department (CSD) of Tuvalu/University of Auckland, New Zealand/United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA)|chapter=|date =2015 |url= http://countryoffice.unfpa.org/pacific/?publications=12319| accessdate=20 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A total of 1,200 people were listed as being out of country on census night with more males (57%) than females (43%) absent. The high proportion in range of ages 15 to 29 years (37 percent of the total) is described as indicating the significance of overseas tertiary education and training.&lt;ref name="CMMUY"/&gt;
* The 2013 Census of [[New Zealand]] reported 3,537 Tuvaluans, an increase of 80 percent from the 1,965 reported in the 2001 census. In the 2013 census, only about 40 percent (1,419) had been born in Tuvalu. The high proportion of Tuvaluans who are New Zealand born illustrates the significance of New Zealand as a long term destination for Tuvaluan migrants.&lt;ref name="CMMUY"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SB"&gt;{{cite journal|author= Shen, S., &amp; Binns, T. |url= |title= Pathways, motivations and challenges: Contemporary Tuvaluan migration to New Zealand |journal= GeoJournal|volume=77 |issue=1|year=2012|pages=63–82}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Tuvaluan community in [[Australia]] is recorded in the 2011 Australian Census as 228 people who put Tuvaluan as their first response to a question on ‘ancestry’; of these 120 were born in Tuvalu.&lt;ref name="CMMUY"/&gt;
* The islands of [[Nanumea]], [[Nanumaga]], [[Nukufetau]] and [[Niutao]] had relatively high net migration losses, with most being internal migrants to [[Funafuti]]. [[Vaitupu]] had the largest net migration gain, although this is attributed to the location of [[Motufoua Secondary School]] on Vaitupu and the movement of students from the other islands.&lt;ref name="CMMUY"/&gt;

[[File:Gender equality symbol (clipart).png|thumb|alt=Male and female symbols around an equal sign|Gender-equality symbol]]
'''Gender equality in Azerbaijan''' is guaranteed by the country's constitution and legislation, and an initiative is in place to prevent domestic violence. [[Azerbaijan]] ratified a United Nations convention in 1995, and a Gender Information Center opened in 2002. A committee on women's issues was established in 1998. 

The [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] declares that women and men should have equal human rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/|title=Universal Declaration of Human Rights|website=www.un.org|language=en|access-date=2017-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, women are still in need of additional protection to help them attain [[gender equality]]. In simple terms, gender equality means reinforcing the protection and promotion of women’s [[human rights]].

== Legislation ==

=== Constitution of Azerbaijan ===
According to the [[Constitution of Azerbaijan]], men and women are equal before the law. The Constitution prohibits discrimination based on gender,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://confinder.richmond.edu/admin/docs/local_azerbaijan.pdf|title=Article 25 of the Constitution of the Republic of Azerbaijan |last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; including workplace discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://confinder.richmond.edu/admin/docs/local_azerbaijan.pdf|title=Article 35 of the Constitution of the Republic of Azerbaijan|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== {{anchor|Law on State Guarantees of Equal Rights for Women and Men}}Guarantee under law ===
The 21-article Law of the Republic of Azerbaijan On State Guarantees of Equal Rights for Women and Men, adopted on 10 October 2006, aims to eliminate all forms of gender-based discrimination and ensure gender equality in the political, economic, social and cultural spheres. All human rights are guaranteed to women and men. To implement the law, public authorities must regularly review legislation related to gender equality and amend it as necessary. The dissemination of information about gender equality and education in the field has been defined by the law as essential.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---ed_protect/---protrav/---ilo_aids/documents/legaldocument/wcms_127414.pdf|title=Law of the Republic of Azerbaijan On State Guarantees of Equal Rights for Women and Men|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== {{anchor|The Law on Prevention of Domestic Violence}}Prevention of domestic violence ===
A law to prevent [[domestic violence]] was adopted on 22 June 2010. The law focuses on domestic violence between close relatives to mitigate its negative legal, medical and social outcomes and provide legal and social assistance for victims. Although it does not state that its aim is to protect women, women are the victims in most cases of domestic violence. The law accepts the prohibition of discrimination against women as a core principle, enumerating three types of domestic violence: physical, psychological and sexual.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cis-legislation.com/document.fwx?rgn=32050|title=Law of the Azerbaijan Republic about prevention of domestic violence|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== {{anchor|International Cooperation}}International cooperation ==

=== Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women ===
Azerbaijan ratified the [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women]] in 1995, and signed its optional protocol in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://treaties.un.org/Pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&amp;mtdsg_no=IV-8&amp;chapter=4&amp;lang=en|title=United Nations Treaty Collection|language=EN|access-date=2017-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first government report to the UN Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) was published on 16 September 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.refworld.org/publisher,CEDAW,,AZE,3ae6ae2514,0.html|title=Refworld {{!}} UN Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women: State Party Report, Azerbaijan|last=Refugees|first=United Nations High Commissioner for|work=Refworld|access-date=2017-10-12|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The convention clarifies the meaning of "discrimination against women" and assigns the state organizations responsible for taking appropriate measures to eliminate all forms of discrimination against women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/cedaw/text/econvention.htm|title=CEDAW 29th Session 30 June to 25 July 2003|website=www.un.org|access-date=2017-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== UN Development Fund for Women (UNIFEM) ===
Cooperation between [[United Nations Development Fund for Women|UNIFEM]] and [[Azerbaijan]] has taken the form of the Women for Conflict Prevention and Peace Building in the Southern Caucasus regional project. The first phase of the project, aiming to promote the activities of women’s organizations and support activists, leaders, and youth in gender equality, peace-building and conflict prevention, took place between 2001 and 2004. The project's second phase, from 2004 to 2007, built on the first phase and reinforced women’s rights based on CEDAW, [[United Nations Security Council|UN Security Council]] Resolution 1325, [[Millennium Development Goals]] and the [[Beijing Platform for Action]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mfa.gov.az/en/content/111|title=Gender issues|last=FS|website=www.mfa.gov.az|access-date=2017-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== {{anchor|Azerbaijan Gender Information Center}}Gender Information Center ==
The Open Society Fund introduced the Azerbaijan Gender Information Center (AGIC) in 2002. The AGIC is made up of several women organizations: the Research Center of Modern Social Processes; the Association of Creative Women and the Azerbaijan Association of Organizational and Technical Development, both in [[Baku]]; the Shams Women and Youth Center in [[Mingachevir|Mingechaur]], and the Hudat Center of Youth Programme Development.

=== Research Center for Modern Social Processes (APEAT) ===
The Research Center for Modern Social Processes is responsibility for the center. APEAT has conducted studies in collaboration with other organizations, including women’s business cooperation in the [[Transcaucasia|southern Caucasus]] (for the [[Eurasia Foundation]] in 1999); women in social conflict (for the World Bank in 2000); women in Azerbaijan society (for Altair in 2000); women against violence (for ISAR-Gorizonte in 2001); women in the local community (for ISAR-Gorizonte in 2002), and gender resources and development of the [[Voluntary sector|third sector]] in Azerbaijan (for ISAR in 2002). 

=== {{anchor|The Azerbaijan Organizational and Technical Development Association}}Organizational and Technical Development Association ===
The Organizational and Technical development Association (an AGIC member) has implemented the following projects in cooperation with the Eurasia Foundation (which supported the association's creation): incubating nongovernmental women's organizations (2000) and women's businesses (2002), and marketing the third sector in Azerbaijan (2001).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gender-az.org/index_en.shtml?id_main=2&amp;id_sub=1|title=Azerbaijan Gender Information Center|website=www.gender-az.org|access-date=2017-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The State Committee on Women's Affairs]] was established by presidential [[decree]] on 14 January 1998, and was replaced with the [[State Committee for Family, Women and Children Affairs (Azerbaijan)|State Committee for Family, Women and Children Affairs]] by another decree on 6 February 2006. The committee [[charter]] was approved by presidential decree on 9 August of that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://scfwca.gov.az/en/page/komitenin-esasnamesi|title=State Committee for Family, Women and Children Affairs of Azerbaijan Republic - Charter of The Committee|website=scfwca.gov.az|language=en-US|access-date=2017-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The committee, a ministerial-level body in [[Baku]] (the Azerbaijani capital), is financed by the [[government budget]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://scfwca.gov.az/en/page/komitenin-tarixi|title=State Committee for Family, Women and Children Affairs of Azerbaijan Republic - History of the Committee|website=scfwca.gov.az|language=en-US|access-date=2017-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is responsible for implementing state policy on family, women and children’s affairs.

At the beginning of the 21st century there were about 450 Indians in the Helsinki region.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hs.fi/english/article/South+Asian+population+grows+sharply+in+Helsinki+region/1135220364219 HELSINGIN SANOMAT - INTERNATIONAL EDITION - METRO - South Asian population grows sharply in Helsinki region]&lt;/ref&gt; Finland is now home to about 1,200 members of the Indian community - one of the smallest of Indian diaspora groups in Europe. The majority of the Indians live in and around the capital [[Helsinki]]. Most of them are engaged in businesses such as restaurants and stores selling garments, textiles, artificial jewellery, groceries and gift items. A number of young Indians, mainly computer and telecom experts, have in recent years joined Finnish high-tech companies such as [[Nokia]].

There are hundreds of Indian engineers working in Finland. Many of them came to work there to get a quality life and also their salary would be double than what they would get in India even though taxes erode the difference.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nordiclabourjournal.org/i-fokus/in-focus-2010/theme-joint-nordic-drive-for-more-foreign-labour/finlands-welfare-system-appeals-to-indian-it-engineers Nordic Labour Journal - Finland's welfare system appeals to Indian IT engineers]&lt;/ref&gt; At Nokia's research facility alone there are nearly 100 Indians working there. [[Wipro]] employed some 300 people in Finland while their competitor [[Tata Consultancy Services]] employed 600 individuals. Many of the engineers came with their spouses and children and have settled permanently in Finland.

There is also a sizable population of Indian postgraduate students, both Master’s and PhD level students, in Finland and especially in Helsinki region. They are most prominent in technology related fields.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.helsinki.fi/top/fintia.html Helsinki in on top in Technology and Research - Finland and India]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13731">[[Integer factorization]] is the process of determining which [[prime number]]s divide a given positive [[integer]]. Doing this quickly has applications in [[cryptography]]. The difficulty depends on both the size and form of the number and its [[prime factor]]s; it is currently very difficult to factorize large [[semiprimes]] (and, indeed, most numbers which have no small factors).

== Numbers of a general form ==

The first very large distributed factorisation was RSA129, a challenge number described in the Scientific American article of 1977 which first popularised the RSA cryptosystem. It was factorised between September 1993 and April 1994, using [[quadratic sieve|MPQS]], with relations contributed by about 600 people from all over the Internet, and the final stages of the calculation performed on a [[MasPar]] supercomputer at Bell Labs.

Between January and August 1999, [[RSA-155]], a challenge number prepared by the RSA company, was factorised using [[number field sieve|GNFS]] with relations again contributed by a large group, and the final stages of the calculation performed in just over nine days on the [[Cray]] [[Cray C90|C916]] supercomputer at the SARA Amsterdam Academic Computer Center.

In January 2002, Franke et al. announced the factorisation of a 158-digit cofactor of 2&lt;sup&gt;953&lt;/sup&gt;+1, using a couple of months on about 25 PCs at the [[University of Bonn]], with the final stages done using a cluster of six Pentium-III PCs.

In April 2003, the same team factored [[RSA-160]] using about a hundred CPUs at [[Bundesamt für Sicherheit in der Informationstechnik|BSI]], with the final stages of the calculation done using 25 processors of an [[Silicon Graphics|SGI]] [[SGI Origin 200|Origin]] supercomputer.

The 174-digit [[RSA-576]] was factored by Franke, Kleinjung and members of the [[NFSNET]] collaboration in December 2003, using resources at BSI and the University of Bonn; soon afterwards, Aoki, Kida, Shimoyama, Sonoda and Ueda announced that they had factored a 164-digit cofactor of 2&lt;sup&gt;1826&lt;/sup&gt;+1.

A 176-digit cofactor of 11&lt;sup&gt;281&lt;/sup&gt;+1 was factored by Aoki, Kida, Shimoyama and Ueda between February and May 2005 using machines at [[Nippon Telegraph and Telephone|NTT]] and [[Rikkyo University]] in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.loria.fr/~zimmerma/records/11_281+ |accessdate=2007-05-23 |title=Factorization of 176-digit number|author1=K. Aoki |author2=Y. Kida |author3=T. Shimoyama |author4=H. Ueda }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[RSA-200]] challenge number was factored by Franke, Kleinjung et al. between December 2003 and May 2005, using a cluster of 80 Opteron processors at BSI in Germany; the announcement was made on 9 May 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.loria.fr/~zimmerma/records/rsa200|accessdate=2007-05-23 |title=RSA200|author1=F. Bahr |author2=M. Boehm |author3=J. Franke |author4=T. Kleinjung }}&lt;/ref&gt; They later (November 2005) factored the slightly smaller [[RSA-640]] challenge number.

On December 12, 2009, a team including researchers from the [[Centrum Wiskunde &amp; Informatica|CWI]], the [[EPFL]], [[INRIA]] and NTT in addition to the authors of the previous record factored [[RSA-768]], a 232-digit semiprime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://eprint.iacr.org/2010/006.pdf|accessdate=2013-04-11 |title=Factorization of a 768-bit RSA modulus|author1=T.

years of computing on a single core 2.2&amp;nbsp;GHz [[Advanced Micro Devices|AMD]] [[Opteron]].

== Numbers of a special form ==

12&lt;sup&gt;151&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1, of 542 bits (163 digits), was factored between April and July 1993 by a team at [[Centrum Wiskunde &amp; Informatica|CWI]] and [[Oregon State University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://krum.rz.uni-mannheim.de/cabench/sieve-record.html|accessdate=2007-11-23|title=Record Number Field Sieve Factorisations|author=P. L. Montgomery }}&lt;/ref&gt;

2&lt;sup&gt;773&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1, of 774 bits (233 digits), was factored between April and November 2000 by 'The Cabal', with the matrix step done over 250 hours on the Cray also used for RSA-155.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ftp.cwi.nl/herman/SNFSrecords/SNFS-233|accessdate=2007-11-23|title=233-digit SNFS factorization|author='The Cabal'|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071128061126/http://ftp.cwi.nl/herman/SNFSrecords/SNFS-233|archivedate=2007-11-28|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

2&lt;sup&gt;809&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1, of 809 bits (244 digits), had its factorisation announced at the start of January 2003. Sieving was done at the CWI, at the Scientific Computing Institute and the Pure Mathematics Department at Bonn University, and using private resources of J. Franke, T. Kleinjung and the family of F. Bahr. The linear algebra step was done by P. Montgomery at SARA in Amsterdam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ftp.cwi.nl/herman/SNFSrecords/SNFS-244|accessdate=2007-11-23|title=M809|author=J.

6&lt;sup&gt;353&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1, of 911 bits (275 digits), was factored by Aoki, Kida, Shimoyama and Ueda between September 2005 and January 2006 using [[special number field sieve|SNFS]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.loria.fr/~zimmerma/records/6353|accessdate=2007-05-23 |title=SNFS274|author1=K.

2&lt;sup&gt;1039&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1, of 1039 bits (313 digits) (though a factor of 23 bits was already known) was factored between September 2006 and May 2007 by a group including K. Aoki, J. Franke, T. Kleinjung, [[A. K. Lenstra]] and D. A. Osvik, using computers at [[Nippon Telegraph and Telephone|NTT]], [[École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne|EPFL]] and the [[University of Bonn]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  | url=http://listserv.nodak.edu/cgi-bin/wa.exe?A2=ind0705&amp;L=nmbrthry&amp;T=0&amp;P=1019  |accessdate=2007-05-23 | title=Factorization of the 1039th Mersenne number |author1=K.

2&lt;sup&gt;1061&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1, of 1061 bits (320 digits) was factored between early 2011 and 4 August 2012 by a group headed by Greg Childers at CSU Fullerton, using the nfs@home [[BOINC]] project for about 300 CPU-years of sieving; the linear algebra was run at the Trestles cluster at SDSC and the Lonestar cluster at TACC and needed additional 35 CPU-years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://eprint.iacr.org/2012/444 |title=Factorization of a 1061-bit number by the Special Number Field Sieve |author=Greg Childers}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All unfactored parts of the numbers 2&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1 with n between 1000 and 1200 were factored by a multiple-number-sieve approach in which much of the sieving step could be done simultaneously for multiple numbers, by a group including T. Kleinjung, J. Bos and [[A. K. Lenstra]], starting in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://eprint.iacr.org/2014/653 | title=Mersenne Factorization Factory |author1=Thorsten Kleinjung |author2=Joppe W Bos |author3=Arjen K Lenstra | accessdate=2015-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; To be precise, n=1081 was completed on 11 March 2013; n=1111 on 13 June 2013; n=1129 on 20 September 2013; n=1153 on 28 October 2013; n=1159 on 9 February 2014; 1177 on May 29, 2014, n=1193 on 22 August 2014, and n=1199 on December 11, 2014; the first detailed announcement was made in late August 2014.  The total effort for the project is of the order of 7500 CPU-years on 2.2&amp;nbsp;GHz Opterons, with roughly 5700 years spent sieving and 1800 years on linear algebra.

==Comparison to efforts by individuals==

As of the end of 2007, thanks to the constant decline in memory prices, the ready availability of multi-core 64-bit computers, and the availability of the efficient sieving code (developed by Thorsten Kleinjung of the Bonn group) via ggnfs&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=140917 |title=GGNFS suite -  Browse Files at SourceForge.net |website=sourceforge.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; and of robust open-source software such as msieve&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.boo.net/~jasonp/qs.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-11-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071213020640/http://www.boo.net/~jasonp/qs.html |archivedate=2007-12-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; for the finishing stages, special-form numbers of up to 750 bits and general-form numbers of up to about 520 bits can be factored in a few months on a few PCs by a single person without any special mathematical experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mersenneforum.org/showpost.php?p=124079&amp;postcount=97 |title=mersenneforum.org - View Single Post -  2LM Table |website=www.mersenneforum.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These bounds increase to about 950&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mersenneforum.org/showpost.php?p=201624&amp;postcount=106 |title=mersenneforum.org - View Single Post -  A computation worthy of the name |website=www.mersenneforum.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 600&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mersenneforum.org/showpost.php?p=149332&amp;postcount=114 |title=mersenneforum.org - View Single Post -  5^421-1 sieving (reservations closed) |website=www.mersenneforum.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; if it were possible to secure the collaboration of a few dozen PCs for sieving; currently the amount of memory and the CPU power of a single machine for the finishing stage are equal barriers to progress.

In 2009, Benjamin Moody factored a 512-bit RSA key used to sign the [[TI-83 series|TI-83]] graphing calculator using software found on the internet; this eventually led to the [[Texas Instruments signing key controversy]].

In September 2013, the 696-bit [[RSA numbers#RSA-210|RSA-210]] was factored by Ryan Propper&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mersenneforum.org/showthread.php?t=18626 |title=RSA-210 factored - mersenneforum.org |website=mersenneforum.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; using institutional resources; between March 2013 and October 2014, another 210-digit number (the 117th term in the 'home prime sequence' starting with 49) was completed by a user known as WraithX,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mersenneforum.org/showpost.php?p=389048&amp;postcount=98 |title=mersenneforum.org - View Single Post -  HP49(119)... |website=www.mersenneforum.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; using $7600 worth of processing time on Amazon EC2 machines for the sieving, and four months on a dual Xeon E5-2687W v1 for the linear algebra.

==Records for efforts by quantum computers==

The largest number factored by [[Shor's algorithm]] is 21 in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Martín-López |first=Enrique  |author2=Enrique Martín-López  |author3=Anthony Laing  |author4=Thomas Lawson  |author5=Roberto Alvarez  |author6=Xiao-Qi Zhou  |author7=Jeremy L.

Rawles published a defense of his anti-racist views in a blog entry entitled "Race, Religion, and Reason" in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lest Any Man Should Boast: A Christian Survivalist Perspective on Race, Religion, and Reason|last1=Rawles|first1=James|url=http://survivalblog.com/lest_any_man_should_boast_a_ch/|website=survivalblog.com|publisher=James Rawles|accessdate=June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rawles believes that survivalists see a high risk of a coming societal meltdown and the need to prepare for the repercussions. He has said that the popular media has developed an incorrect far-right "lunatic fringe" image in part because of the actions of a radical few. He called this a distortion of the true message of survivalism. Unlike the handful of fringe proponents, Rawles focuses instead on family preparedness and personal freedom. He explains that the typical survivalist does not actually live in a rural area, but is rather a city dweller worried about the collapse of society who views the rural lifestyle as idyllic. He cautions that rural self-sufficiency actually involves "a lot of hard work".&lt;ref name="urlSurvivalists get ready for meltdown"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/europe/04/20/survival.feat/index.html#cnnSTCText|title=Survivalists get ready for meltdown - CNN.com|date=2 May 2008|quote=Of course, none of this kind of talk is that new.

There's a steep learning curve going on right now."&lt;ref name="SP5-26-09" /&gt; In a December 2014 interview with ''[[The Economist]]'' magazine, Rawles described the survivalist movement as decentralized and full of people who value their privacy. He said: "You don't want to be known as the guy who has 3-4 years' supply of food in the basement. Because one day you could see it confiscated by the government or stolen by neighbours like hungry locusts."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.economist.com/node/21636611/print|title=I will survive|date=2014-12-20|publisher=The Economist|accessdate=2015-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Patriots: A Novel of Survival in the Coming Collapse''===
{{main|Patriots Novels Series}}

His first novel was a work of [[speculative fiction]] set in a near future including [[hyperinflation]] and socioeconomic collapse.  Initially titled: ''Patriots: Surviving the Coming Collapse'', and later re-titled: ''[[Patriots: A Novel of Survival in the Coming Collapse]]''. The book was originally released in draft form as [[shareware]]&lt;ref&gt;"On-line Underground," ''The Spokesman-Review'' (Spokane). 3 December 1995, page H7&lt;/ref&gt; under the title "Triple Ought" in the early 1990s. It was released in a printed edition by Huntington House.  After Huntington House went out of business, the book was re-released by [[Xlibris]], a "print on demand" publisher.  Starting in April 2009, the novel was published in a paperback edition by Ulysses Press. It was updated to include a glossary&lt;ref&gt;''Patriots: A Novel of Survival in the Coming Collapse'', Ulysses Press, Berkeley, California, 2009, pp. 388–393&lt;/ref&gt;{{Self-published inline|certain=yes|date=December 2017}} and index.&lt;ref&gt;''Patriots: A Novel of Survival in the Coming Collapse'', Ulysses Press, Berkeley, California, 2009, pp. 394–399&lt;/ref&gt;

In early April 2009, shortly after its release, it was ranked number 6 in Amazon.com's overall book sales rankings, but fell to number 33 a week later.&lt;ref name="Library Journal"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.libraryjournal.com/article/CA6651539.html |title=Survivalist Novel Patriots Rates High in Amazon, Not Libraries |publisher=Library Journal |date=14 April 2009 |accessdate=21 February 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090425071958/http://www.libraryjournal.com/article/CA6651539.html |archivedate=25 April 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the month it had fallen to number 98.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/gp/bestsellers/2009-04-27/books/ref=pd_ts_pg_4/190-5513629-2305443?ie=UTF8&amp;pg=4 |title=Best Sellers of April 27, 2009 in Books |publisher=Amazon.com |date=27 April 2009 |accessdate=4 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book's initial popularity caught librarians unprepared because it was considered a niche title and had not been reviewed by the major book review publications.  According to ''[[Library Journal]]'', the topic struck a chord with "a small but vociferous group of people concerned with survivalism" who share a sense of societal anxiety associated with the economic recession.  The journal went on to say that ''Patriots'' was "reportedly originally conceived as a nonfiction guide. According to a number of Amazon.com reviewers, the novel will not win any literary prizes; its strength lies in its practical reassurances, focus on guns, and Christian ideology."  Librarians then scrambled to purchase copies of the book to meet the unanticipated demand.&lt;ref name="Library Journal"/&gt;

===''Survivors: A Novel of the Coming Collapse''===
''Survivors: A Novel of the Coming Collapse'' is a contemporaneous sequel novel that parallels the events that occur in ''Patriots'', following a hyperinflationary socioeconomic collapse and the subsequent events known as "The Crunch".

The book was released on 4 October 2011.  It rose to #2 in Amazon's overall book sales ranks, the same day.  On 23 October 2011, it was listed at #3 in the ''New York Times'' Best Sellers list in the fiction hardback category.&lt;ref name="schuessler1"/&gt;  Less than a month after publication, the novel had gone through four printings and had 52,500 copies in print.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.survivalblog.com/2011/11/note_from_jwr_1413.html |title=Note from JWR |publisher=SurvivalBlog.com |date= |accessdate=10 February 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120105173315/http://www.survivalblog.com/2011/11/note_from_jwr_1413.html |archivedate= 5 January 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A Spanish edition (titled ''Superviventes''), was released in 2014.

His ''How to Survive the End of the World as We Know It: Tactics, Techniques, and Technologies for Uncertain Times'' is a non-fiction book drawn primarily from his posts on SurvivalBlog.com. The book was described as "The preppers' Bible", by a [[Reuters]] journalist.&lt;ref name="Forsyth"/&gt; His blog addresses preparing for the multitude of possible threats toward society. Rawles describes how to prepare against a post-disaster society that suffers looting, armed violence and [[Famine|food shortages]].

The book received a mixed review from the ''New York Journal of Books:''

&lt;blockquote&gt;For a neutral assessment of the huge efforts put in by the author, the book has its own strengths and weaknesses; however, the former outweigh the latter by a huge margin. One of its crystal clear strengths is the author's obsession with precision and a clinical eye for relevant details.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wesley |first=James |url=http://www.nyjournalofbooks.com/review/how-survive-end-world-we-know-it-tactics-techniques-and-technologies-uncertain-times |title=How to Survive the End of the World As We Know It: Tactics, Techniques and Technologies for Uncertain Times &amp;#124; New York Journal of Books |work=New York Journal of Books |date=30 September 2009 |accessdate=4 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===''Land of Promise''===
On December 1, 2015, Rawles released the novel ''Land of Promise'', the first book in the ''Counter-Caliphate Chronicles'' novel series. This [[science fiction]] novel is a geopolitical thriller that is a considerable departure from his previous ''Patriots'' [[thriller novel]] series.  Set in the late 2130s,  ''Land of Promise'' fictionally describes the world under the economic and military domination of a Global Islamic Caliphate, brought about by a fictional new branch of Islam, called The Thirdists.  The novel also describes the establishment of a Christian nation of refuge called The Ilemi Republic, in East Africa.  This is the first book in a planned six-novel series. It is the first release from Liberty Paradigm Publishing, a publishing venture launched by Rawles in partnership with his literary agent Robert Gottlieb of Trident Media Group.&lt;ref&gt;http://survivalblog.com/notes-for-tuesday-december-01-2015/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fantasticfiction.co.uk/r/james-wesley-rawles/land-of-promise.htm|title=Land of Promise|work=fantasticfiction.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophical, political and economic views==
Rawles is an proponent of family preparedness, especially regarding food storage&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Josh Gerstein |url=http://www.nysun.com/news/food-rationing-confronts-breadbasket-world |title=Food Rationing Confronts Breadbasket of the World |publisher=Nysun.com |date=21 April 2008 |accessdate=21 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and advocates relocating to lightly populated rural "[[retreat (survivalism)|retreat]]" areas. His preparedness philosophy emphasizes the fragility of modern society, the value of silver and other tangibles for barter, recognition of moral absolutes, being well-armed, maintaining a "deep larder," relocation to rural retreats, and [[Charity (virtue)|Christian charity]].&lt;ref&gt;How to Survive The End of the World as We Know It, Plume (Division of Penguin Books), New York, 2009, p. 11-17.&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview in ''[[The New York Times]]'', Rawles identified himself as a "guns and groceries" survivalist.&lt;ref name="urlEditorial Observer - Out of Work? Read a Recession Blog. Or, Better Yet, Write One. - NYTimes.com"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/05/opinion/05thu3.html |title=Editorial Observer - Out of Work?

Rawles interprets the 2nd Amendment as supporting citizens' individual rights to bear and keep arms. He believes they should be able to take arms to public events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.foxbusiness.com/search-results/m/25952317/right-to-protest-with-a-gun.htm |title=Right to Protest ...

Rawles is opposed to racism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ashevilledailyplanet.com/news/2828-collapse-coming-survival-guru-tailor-tips-to-carolinians |title=Collapse coming?

==American Redoubt movement==
{{main|American Redoubt}}
In March 2011, Rawles formulated the [[American Redoubt]]  movement. Rawles proposes five western states ([[Idaho]], [[Montana]], [[Wyoming]], eastern [[Oregon]], and eastern [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]]) as a safe haven for conservative Christians and Jews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.survivalblog.com/redoubt.html |title=SurvivalBlog.com |publisher=SurvivalBlog.com |date=15 April 2011 |accessdate=10 February 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120217212813/http://www.survivalblog.com/redoubt.html |archivedate=17 February 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept was endorsed by former Presidential candidate [[Chuck Baldwin]], who had recently relocated his entire extended family to western Montana.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newswithviews.com/baldwin/baldwin642.htm |title=Chuck Baldwin – The American Redoubt |publisher=Newswithviews.com |date=31 March 2011 |accessdate=10 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of its adherents, John Jacob Schmidt, started a weekly podcast called ''Radio Free Redoubt'' to help further the movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=J.J.S. |url=http://radiofreeredoubt.blogspot.com/ |title=Radio Free Redoubt |publisher=Radiofreeredoubt.blogspot.com |date=5 February 2012 |accessdate=10 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Citizen Journalism facilitator==
Rawles is a proponent of [[Citizen Journalism]]. In April 2014, along with his son Robert, Rawles co-founded The Constitution First Amendment Press Association (CFAPA),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cfapa.org/ |title=Constitution First Amendment Press Association (CFAPA) Free Press Credentials (Free Press Pass) - An Independent Press Association |publisher=CFAPA |date= |accessdate=2015-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; a private free press advocacy group that distributes press credentials to any literate adult U.S. Citizen, free of charge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shtfplan.com/headline-news/the-last-line-of-defense-new-organization-aims-to-protect-citizen-journalists-we-will-stand-with-you_05142014 |title=The Last Line of Defense: New Organization Aims to Protect Citizen Journalists: "We Will Stand With You" |publisher=Shtfplan.com |date=2014-05-14 |accessdate=2015-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sheets |first=David |url=http://blogs.spjnetwork.org/tech/2014/05/23/survivalist-starts-issuing-his-own-press-passes/ |title=Net Worked » Blog Archive » Survivalist starts issuing his own press passes &amp;#124; A Society of Professional Journalists Blog |publisher=Blogs.spjnetwork.org |date=2014-05-23 |accessdate=2015-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Secret ranch location==
Rawles has lived in [[San Jose, California]]; near [[Orofino, Idaho]]; near [[Smartville, California|Smartsville]] in [[Fremont, California]]; and near [[New Washoe City, Nevada]]. An article published by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation in 2008 incorrectly asserted that Rawles lived in California, but later in that article, Rawles noted that the location of his ranch in the United States is kept secret, but that he lives somewhere west of the Rockies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Peter Ryan |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2008/04/28/2228908.htm |title=Global food crisis sparks US survivalist resurgence – ABC News (Australian Broadcasting Corporation) |publisher=Abc.net.au |date=28 April 2008 |accessdate=10 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The German newspaper ''[[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung]]'' asserts that the ranch is in northern Idaho.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Jordan |last=Mejias |date=9 May 2009 |title=Amerikanischer Bestseller: 'Patriots': Wie das Ende unserer Welt zu überleben ist – Autoren |url=http://www.faz.net/aktuell/feuilleton/buecher/rezensionen/amerikanischer-bestseller-patriots-wie-das-ende-unserer-welt-zu-ueberleben-ist-1797611.html |work=[[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung]] |accessdate=16 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others have claimed that the "undisclosed location" of the ranch is in Nevada, Utah, Wyoming or even in Central America.&lt;ref name="Sara Nelson"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.survivalblog.com/contact.html |title=SurvivalBlog.com |publisher=SurvivalBlog.com |date= |accessdate=4 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A CNN Europe article written before his first wife died noted that Rawles "... lives on a ranch in an undisclosed location with his wife (who he refers to in his blog affectionately as 'the Memsahib') and their children. Their life is almost entirely self-sufficient: They keep livestock, hunt elk and the children are schooled at home. Stored away in the ranch somewhere is a three-year supply of food."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://edition.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/europe/04/20/survival.feat/ | title=Survivalists get ready for meltdown |publisher=[[CNN]] | date=2 May 2008|accessdate=4 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an article titled "The Most Dangerous Novel in America", Rawles told ''The Daily Beast'': "I'm not at liberty to discuss where I live. It's part of an agreement I made with my wife. I really can't go into the details. We live in a very remote area. I embrace technology. We don't live in a cellphone area, but I'm online constantly. We're just prepared to live off-grid, if the power grid goes down. Because of the nature of my blog and my novel, I don't just want anonymity, I ''need'' anonymity. I could wake up some morning in the aftermath of some crisis and look out in my barnyard and see five Winnebagos and some television news crews. I don't want fans of my books to descend on my property, so I have to be perspicacious."&lt;ref name="thedailybeast.com"/&gt; In 2009, Rawles told an [[Agence France-Presse]] reporter: "I'm surrounded by national forest. A river runs through the back end of the property, so there's no shortage of water and no shortage of fish or game to shoot. If Western civilization were to collapse tomorrow, I'd have to read about it on the Internet. I just wouldn't notice."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zimbio.com/AFP+News/articles/13930/Thought+things+bad+survivalists+await+worse |title=Thought things were bad? US survivalists await worse |agency=[[Agence France-Presse]] |publisher=Zimbio |date=30 January 2009 |accessdate=10 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; His U.S. mail address is a post office box in Newcastle, Wyoming, but his main web site server is in Sweden.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

The '''Khlout''' is a Moroccan [[Arab]]ian tribe of Jacham, of the [[Banu Hilal]] confideracy.&lt;ref&gt;Historical Dictionary of the Bedouins. Muhammad Suwaed. USA. (2015). Page 133-134. Date 28-07-2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Native to [[Bahrain]] today, the tribe first settled in [[Egypt]] and [[Tunisia]]. In the twelfth century, Almohade ruler Yakoub Al Mansour brought them in [[Morocco]] and installed them at [[Chaouia (Morocco)|Tamesna]] (current Chaouia).

The khlout inhabited the region of Tadla portion of Tamesna in the early days of the [[Saadi dynasty]]. Around 1540, they entered the service of Muhammad al-Sheikh and then they rebelled against him to join the Turkish army of Wattasid Abu Hassoun. After Muhammad al-Sheikh became the ruler of Morocco, the khlout took military controls in Morocco, introduced the payment of tax and deported their leader in Marrakech.
With the advent of Ahmed El Mansour in 1578, and due to their heroic conduct at the battle of El Oued Makhazen 1578, half of the tribe controlled the army; the other half was told to move to the Azghar.&lt;ref&gt;Khlout. http://tribusdumaroc.free.fr/khlout.php. 2016-07-2016&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Korlai Indo-Portuguese''' is a [[creole language]] based on [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], spoken by some 1,000 [[Luso-Indian]] [[Christian]]s in an isolated area around the village of [[Korlai]] in [[Raigad District]] of [[Maharashtra]] state, [[India]]. It is located between Goa and Daman. It has vigorous use and it is also known as '''Kristi''' ("Christian"), Korlai Creole Portuguese, Korlai Portuguese, or ''Nou Ling'' ("our language" in the language itself).

== Distribution and number of speakers ==
[[File:Korlai.jpg|thumb|The village of Korlai viewed from [[Korlai Fort]]]]

The village of Korlai lies on the mouth of Kundalika River, across from the ruins of [[Korlai Fort|a large Portuguese fort]], which is located in [[Revdanda]]. Until the 20th century, Korlai, its Christian inhabitants, and its language were relatively isolated from the Marathi-speaking Hindus and Muslims surrounding them. Since 1986, there is a bridge across the [[Kundalika River]], because of which industry has now moved into the area.

What is known about the history and the grammar of ''No Ling'' can be found in the 1996 book ''The Genesis of a Language: Formation and Development of Korlai Portuguese'' written by J. Clancy Clements. 

== Examples of ''No Ling'' ==

:Thanks a lot: ''Muit'obrigad!'' From Port. ''Muito Obrigado''
:I: ''yo''; From Port. ''eu''
:You (singular): ''wo''; From Port. ''vós''
:You (formal): ''usé''; From Port. ''você''
:He and She: ''el''; From Port. ''ele'' (he) and ''ela'' (she)
:We: ''no''; From Port. ''nós''
:You (plural): ''udzó''; From Port. ''vós outros''
:They: ''eló''; from Port. ''eles outros''
:Numerals: ''ũ, doy, tre, kwat, sink, sey, set, oyt, nob, dey''; From Port. ''um, dois, três, quatro, cinco, seis, sete, oito, nove, dez''
:First, Second: ''Primer, Sigun''; From Port. ''Primeiro, Segundo''
:How are you?: ''Use, kile te?''
:All are eating and drinking their fill: ''tud gent cumen beben tem fart''; From Port. ''toda a gente come e bebe até farta''

Song of Korlai:
:''Maldita Maria Madulena,''
:''Maldita firmosa,''
:''Ai, contra ma ja foi a Madulena,''
:''Vastida de mata!''

Portuguese translation:
:''Maldita Maria Madalena,''
:''Maldita Formosa,''
:''Ai, contra minha vontade foi a Madalena,''
:''Vestida de mata!''

English translation:
:Cursed Maria Madalena,
:Cursed Beautiful one,
:Oh, against my will it was Madalena,
:Dressed in leaves and branches!

'''Koyra Chiini''' ({{IPA-xx|kojra tʃiːni|}}, figuratively "town language"), or '''Western Songhay''', is a member of the [[Songhay languages]] spoken in [[Mali]] by about 200,000 people (in 1999) along the [[Niger River]] in [[Timbuktu]] and upriver from it in the towns of [[Diré]], [[Tonka, Tombouctou Region|Tonka]], [[Goundam]] and [[Niafunké]] as well as in the [[Sahara|Saharan]] town of [[Araouane]] to its north. In this area, Koyra Chiini is the dominant language and the ''[[lingua franca]]'', although minorities speaking [[Hassaniya Arabic]], [[Tamasheq language|Tamasheq]] and [[Fula language|Fulfulde]] are found. '''Djenné Chiini''' {{IPA-xx|dʒɛnːɛ tʃiːni|}}, the dialect spoken in [[Djenné]], is [[mutually comprehensible]], but has noticeable differences, in particular two extra vowels ({{IPA|/ɛ/}} and {{IPA|/ɔ/}}) and syntactic differences related to [[focus (linguistics)|focalisation]].

East of Timbuktu, Koyra Chiini gives way relatively abruptly to another Songhay language, [[Koyraboro Senni]].

Unlike most Songhai languages, Koyra Chiini has no phonemic [[tone (linguistics)|tones]] and has [[subject–verb–object]] word order rather than [[subject–object–verb]]. It has changed the original Songhay ''z'' to ''j''.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=Hs028DVIPPQC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR13&amp;dq=koyra+chiini+phonology&amp;ots=ZD8N9-gxcF&amp;sig=W5JsxeKhb5YzqN5cLDvGBBfonyU#v=onepage&amp;q=phonology&amp;f=false|title=A Grammar of Koyra Chiini: The Songhay of Timbuktu|last=Heath|first=Jeffrey|date=1999-01-01|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|isbn=9783110804850|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Phonology ==
Koyra Chiini has 5 vowels: /a, e, i, o, u/. All vowels have lengthened counterparts.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The English term derives from "''pays limitrophes''", a term in [[diplomacy|diplomatic]] [[French language|French]].&lt;ref name="limit"&gt;{{cite book |title=Dictionnaire Manuel de Diplomatie et de Droit International Public et Privé |last=Calvo |first=Carlos |year=2009 |publisher=The Lawbook Exchange, Ltd|page=246|url=https://books.google.ru/books?id=T7DXvH0k3lcC&amp;pg=PA102&amp;lpg=PA102&amp;dq=territoire+de+l'Etat+limitrophe&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=kcDG7wTEwz&amp;sig=1zZdxj7tJkoNWzKjCDJZgQBjubc&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=limitrophe&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In [[ancient Rome]], the term referred to provinces at the [[borders of the Roman Empire]] ({{lang-la|limitrophus}}), which were obliged to provide billeting of the ''[[limitanei]]'' [[Roman legion|legion]]s deployed on their territory, mostly in ''[[limes]]''.&lt;ref name="latdeu"&gt;{{cite book |title=Ausführliches lateinisch-deutsches Handwörterbuch |last=Georges |first=Karl Ernst |year=1998 |publisher=Nachdruck Darmstadt|page=Band 2, Sp. 660|url=http://www.zeno.org/Georges-1913/A/limitrophus}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern history, it was used to reference provinces which seceded from the [[Russian empire]] at the end of [[World War I]], during the [[Russian Civil War]] (1917–1922), thus forming a kind of belt separating the [[Union of Soviet Socialist Republics|Soviet Russia]] from the Western powers.&lt;ref name="Smele"&gt;{{cite book|title=Civil war in Siberia: the anti-Bolshevik government of Admiral Kolchak, 1918-1920 |last=Smele |first=John | location=London| publisher=Cambridge University Press| page=305| year=1996| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VNFiD_v6fj4C&amp;pg=PA305&amp;dq=limitrophe+Baltic&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=limitrophe%20Baltic&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== 1918–1939 ==
Before the [[Treaty of Versailles]] was signed on {{date|1919-6-28}} and even after it was not clear yet, which territories of the [[Russian Empire]], either occupied by German troops or engaged in the [[Civil War in Russia]], may maintain their independence, which they started to proclaim from late 1917. Thus the very composition of the Limitrophe zone was uncertain and varied widely. Arguing that these nations were then "the cards to change hands in big political games", among them the Baltic peoples, Poles, Lithuanians, Ukrainians, Belarusians, and so on.&lt;ref name="AF"&gt;{{cite book|title=Ivan the Terrible: a military history |last=Filiushkin |first=Alexander | publisher=Frontline Books| year=2008| pages=264| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rycMAQAAMAAJ&amp;dq=limitrophe+Baltic&amp;q=limitrophe#search_anchor}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The usage of term "limitrophe states" continued after World War I. Treaties were signed through the beginning of [[World War II]]. The ''[[Small Soviet Encyclopedia]]'' (1929) defines the limitrophe states as "states formed from the outskirts of the former Tsarist Russia, mainly from the western provinces". It includes in their list [[Estonia]], [[Latvia]], and [[Lithuania]], adding "and, partially, [[Poland]] and [[Finland]]".&lt;ref&gt;''Волин, Б.''. '''Лимитрофы'''. Малая Советская энциклопедия. М.: 1929, — т.4, стлб.641.&lt;/ref&gt; Nine years later the [[Explanatory Dictionary of the Russian Language (Ushakov)|Ushakov's Explanatory Dictionary]] (1938) also syntactically 'separates' Finland from the three [[Baltic States]]: ("Estonia, Lithuania, Latvia and Finland as well"). However, Poland is not mentioned in this list.&lt;ref name="UshakovOriginal"&gt;'''Лимитроф'''. Толковый словарь русского языка. Под ред. проф. Д.Н.Ушакова. т. 2. — М.:ОГИЗ, 1938. — стлб.61.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Directive "On the preparation of [[Wehrmacht]] for 1939-1940" signed on {{date|1939-4-11}} by [[Adolf Hitler]] said, in particular, that:
{{quote|text=The status of the limitrophe states will be defined exclusively by the military interests of Germany. As the events develop there might arise necessity to occupy the limitrophe states as far as the border of the former [[Courland]] and to annex these territories to the [[German Reich|Reich]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qA8TAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=limitrophe+Baltic&amp;dq=limitrophe+Baltic&amp;hl=en|title=New Times (Directive as of {{date|1939-4-11}} on the preparation of Wehrmacht for 1939-1940)|date=1 May 1989|publisher=Newspaper "Trud,"|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;|sign=[[Adolf Hitler]]}}

There is nothing to imply that Taiwan is or should be part of the PRC, nor that Mainland China is or should be part of the ROC. It is included solely for comparison purposes and in the spirit of neutrality. Please stop removing it.</comment>

The article lists [[China]]'s first-level [[Administrative divisions of China|administrative divisions]] by their [[gross domestic product]] per capita in main years. All figures are given in the national currency, [[renminbi]] (CNY), and in [[USD]] at nominal values according to recent exchange rates as well as according to [[purchasing power parity]] (PPP). The [[List of Renminbi exchange rates|average CNY exchange rate]] used here is from the [[National Bureau of Statistics of China]], and [[List of Renminbi exchange rates#Purchasing power parity|CNY PPP exchange rates]] are estimated according to the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF).

For comparison purposes, this article also displays the GDPs of [[Taiwan]] (ROC) and the [[Special administrative regions of China|special administrative regions]] (SARs) of [[Hong Kong]] and [[Macau]], which maintain separate economic systems and currencies. These figures are shown in USD based on PPP, as estimated by the International Monetary Fund.{{ref|A}}

==During prohibition==
In the U.S., cannabis was initially grown for industrial reasons, though it quickly became a staple medicinal product in the early 19th century and recreational use became more prevalent during the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&amp;pid=S1516-44462006000200015&lt;/ref&gt; [[Harry J. Anslinger]], Commissioner of the [[Federal Bureau of Narcotics]], responded to political pressure to ban marijuana at a nationwide level. The [[Marihuana Tax Act of 1937]] created an expensive [[excise]] tax, and included penalty provisions and elaborate rules of enforcement to which marijuana, cannabis, or hemp handlers, were subject. [[Mandatory sentencing]] and increased punishment were enacted when the [[United States Congress]] passed the [[Boggs Act of 1952]] and the [[Narcotics Control Act of 1956]].&lt;ref name=Schlosser21&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Schlosser|2003|p=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[counterculture of the 1960s]], attitudes towards marijuana and drug abuse policy changed as marijuana use among "white middle-class college students" became widespread.&lt;ref name=Schlosser22&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Schlosser|2003|p=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In ''[[Leary v. United States]]'' (1969), the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] held the Marihuana Tax Act to be unconstitutional since it violated the [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution]], privilege against self-incrimination. In response, Congress passed the [[Controlled Substances Act]] as Title II of the [[Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970]], which repealed the Marihuana Tax Act.&lt;ref&gt;Pub. L. No. 91–513, 84 Stat. 1236 (October 27, 1973).&lt;/ref&gt; In 1972, the [[National Commission on Marijuana and Drug Abuse]] concluded that marijuana should be decriminalized, but that public use and driving while intoxicated should remain illegal. By the end of the decade, several states had [[Decriminalization|decriminalized]] the drug, while many others weakened their laws against cannabis use.

However, a wave of [[Conservatism in the United States|conservatism]] during the 1980s allowed president [[Ronald Reagan]] to accelerate the [[War on Drugs]] during his [[Presidency of Ronald Reagan|presidency]], prompting anti-drug campaigns such as the "[[Just Say No]]" campaign of [[First Lady of the United States|First Lady]] [[Nancy Reagan]]. Federal penalties for cultivation, possession, or transfer of marijuana were increased by the [[Comprehensive Crime Control Act]] (1984), the Anti-Drug Abuse Act (1986), and the Anti-Drug Abuse Amendment Act (1988).&lt;ref name=Schlosser25&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Schlosser|2003|p=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since California voters passed the [[California Proposition 215 (1996)|Proposition 215]] in 1996, which legalized [[medical cannabis]], several states have followed suit. However, ''[[United States v. Oakland Cannabis Buyers' Cooperative]]'' (2001) rejected the common-law medical necessity defense to crimes enacted under the Controlled Substances Act because Congress concluded that cannabis has "no currently accepted medical use" and ''[[Gonzales v. Raich]]'' (2005) concluded that the [[Commerce Clause]] of the [[Article I of the United States Constitution|Article I of the Constitution]] allowed the federal government to ban the use of cannabis, including medical use. Today, cannabis remains classified as a [[List of Schedule I drugs (US)|Schedule I drug]] under the Controlled Substances Act, and possession is punishable by up to one year in jail and a minimum fine of $1,000 for a first conviction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/features/image/la-ig-potculture30-2009aug30,0,669328.story|title=Marijuana's new high life|date=August 30, 2009|accessdate=September 30, 2009|first=Adam|last=Tschorn|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|publisher=[[Tribune Company]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is a listing of enterprises, gangs, and syndicates that are involved in organized crime. Tongs and outlaw motorcycle gangs, as well as terrorist, militant, and paramilitary groups are mentioned if they are involved in criminal activity for funding. However, since their stated aim and genesis is often ideological rather than commercial, they are distinct from mafia-type groups.

==[[Drug cartel]]s==
{{See also|Allegations of CIA drug trafficking}}

In several drug-producing or transit countries, drug traffickers have taken advantage of local corruption and lack of law enforcement to establish cartels turning in millions if not billions of dollars each year. Sometimes if government enforcement is particularly poor, the cartels become quasi-paramilitary organizations.

==Post-Soviet organized crime==
{{See also|Russian oligarchs|}}

Although organized crime existed in the Soviet era, the gangs really gained in power and international reach during the [[Perestroika|transition to capitalism]]. The term [[Russian Mafia]], 'mafiya' or mob is a blanket (and somewhat inaccurate) term for the various organized crime groups that emerged in this period from the 15 former republics of the [[USSR]] and unlike their Italian counterparts does not mean members are necessarily of Russian ethnicity or uphold any ancient criminal traditions, although this is the case for some members.

The [[yakuza]] of Japan are similar to the Italian mafias in that they originated centuries ago and follow a rigid set of traditions, but have several aspects that make them unique, such as their [[Body suit (tattoo)|full-body tattoos]] and their fairly open place in Japanese society. Many yakuza groups are umbrella organizations, smaller gangs reporting to a larger crime syndicate.

====Triads and other Chinese criminal organizations====
{{See also|Tiandihui|Kuomintang in Burma#CIA connection and opium trade}}

The [[Triad (underground society)|Triads]] is a popular name for a number of Chinese criminal secret societies, which have existed in various forms over the centuries (see for example [[Tiandihui]]). However, not all Chinese gangs fall into line with these traditional groups, as many non-traditional criminal organizations have formed, both in China and the Chinese diaspora.

==Drug and smuggling rings==
Smuggling is a behavior that has occurred ever since there were laws or a moral code that forbade access to a specific person or object. At the core of any [[smuggling organization]] is the economic relationship between [[supply and demand]]. From the organization's point of view, the issues are what the consumer wants, and how much the consumer is willing to pay the smuggler or smuggling organization to obtain it.

==Prison gangs==
Prisons are a natural meeting place for criminals, and for the purposes of protection from other inmates and business prisoners join gangs. These gangs often develop a large influence outside the prison walls through their networks. Most [[prison gang]]s do more than offer simple protection for their members. Most often, prison gangs are responsible for any drug, tobacco or alcohol handling inside correctional facilities. Furthermore, many prison gangs involve themselves in prostitution, assaults, kidnappings and murders. Prison gangs often seek to intimidate the other inmates, pressuring them to relinquish their food and other resources. In addition, prison gangs often exercise a large degree of influence over [[organized crime]] in the "free world", larger than their isolation in prison might lead one to expect.

==[[Gang|Street gangs]]==
Youth gangs have often served as a recruiting ground for more organized crime syndicates, where juvenile delinquents grow up to be full-fledged mobsters, as well as providing muscle and other low-key work. Increasingly, especially in the United States and other western countries, [[street gangs]] are becoming much more organized in their own right with a hierarchical structure and are fulfilling the role previously taken by traditional organized crime.

"'''Mutual credit'''" (sometimes called "[[multilateral barter]]" or "[[credit clearing]]") is a term mostly used in the field of [[complementary currencies]] to describe a common, usually small scale, [[endogenous money]] system. 

The term implies that [[creditors]] and [[debtors]] are the same people lending to each other, but there are several nuances. Some think of mutual credit as a type of [[currency]] but this can be problematic because no currency or money is 'issued' in the sense that most people would understand it. Cash is very rarely 'issued', accounting normally taking place on a [[ledger]], therefore it could also be called 'ledger money', a money ''system'',  accounting for [[Exchange (organized market)|exchange]] or [[credit clearing]] system. The accounting is explained under [[multilateral exchange]].

==Economics==
The practice of multilateral exchange can be a mere convenience, but once a common unit of account is agreed, the extent to which members can draw credit limited, a mutual credit system quickly resembles a money system. However, mutual credit is not one of the recognised [[schools of economic thought]], perhaps because its [[egalitarianism|egalitarian]] implication makes it politically unacceptable. 

Even so, [[Keynes]] proposed a mutual credit system called [[International Clearing Union]] instead of a [[gold standard]], but it was rejected, likely because equal relations and payable debts would have reduced American leverage over the global economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Massimo|first1=Amato|last2=Luca|first2=Fantacci|title=The End of Finance|date=2009|publisher=Polity|isbn=978-0-7456-5111-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ideas can, however, be found in [[mutualism (economic theory)|mutualism]], which does value equitable exchange and cooperation.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

==Characteristics==
===Sufficiency===
In the mainstream economy, money is regarded as a scarce commodity, which is rented out many times simultaneously by those who have it, to those who don't.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}} This practice leads directly to [[Hoarding (economics)|hoarding]] and thus scarcity of money, to a growing [[wealth gap]], to the [[poverty trap]], the [[boom/bust cycle]] the [[economic growth]] 'imperative' and many other seemingly eternal social evils.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lietaer et al|first1=Bernard|title=Money &amp; Sustainability: the missing link|date=2012|publisher=Triarchy Press|isbn=978-1-908009-75-3|url=http://www.triarchypress.net/money-and-sustainability.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mutual credit accounting emphasises the importance of balanced exchange over the importance of property owners getting something for nothing.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}} 
When every credit is matched by an equal and opposite debt, which is to say when there is no money and no interest, then supply equals demand ''a priori'', and all the problems of [[economic equilibrium]] go away. 

===Elasticity of the money supply===
Similarly, the very politicised question of the size of the [[money supply]] is solved because the credit is perfectly [[elasticity (economics)|elastic]]; it is available in whatever quantity the debtor is trusted to repay. Without interest on deposits, there is no reason to hoard credit – all credit is treated as a short-term loan between trusted partners, though many systems make provision for default similar to insurance.

===Decentralisation===
The implication of mutual credit is that anyone can access credit to the extent to which they are trusted to repay. This can be contrasted to commercial credit systems in which only banks can 'issue' credit. Similarly the risk of default is spread differently.

===Seignorage===
In a fiat money system the benefits of issuing money fall to the sovereign who can spend money out of nothing. In a commercial credit system the interest from lending money out of nothing falls to the bank. In a mutual credit system, there is no seignorage mechanism, and no interest.

===Inflation===
Since the money supply is elastic, the problem of [[inflation]] (too much money in too small economy) should never happen in a mutual credit, and if it does, it indicates a failure of governance. Some systems allow the 'house' account unlimited spending, and this destroys the equilibrium, resulting either in inflation, or in recession.

===Access to credit===
National economies are biased towards fossil fuels and multinational corporations because they represent the least risk and most profit to the bank.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}} Depending on the meaning of 'mutual' a mutual credit economy might imply that the people who give value to the money decide which endeavours deserve the privilege of credit.

===Solidarity economy===
Another meaning of mutuality emerges especially in small groups because any account's failure to close on zero affects the ability of others to meet their obligations. Thus if a member is struggling, then an onus is placed on other members to help out or be lenient, because a default reduces the spending power or liquidity of the currency for everyone.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

==Symmetry==
In conventional money systems there are considerable ethical [[usury|concerns around lending]] and [[debtors' prison|borrowing]]. A comparison of punishments meted out to the [[European troika|troika]] for loan sharking and the punishment to the [[Greek government-debt crisis|Greek government]] for defaulting on interest repayments shows that in modern times the political and moral superiority of creditors over debtors is near absolute.

In a mutual credit system, since everyone starts the same and ends the same, it doesn't matter who is 'ahead' or 'behind' at any given moment, or even when they reciprocate, as long as they eventually do.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}} Every transaction involves one person extending credit to another, there is a necessary [[moral equivalence]] of creditors and debtors. Similarly, just as in banking, credit is limited to the degree to which the account-holder is trusted, in mutual credit, debit is often also limited to the degree to which the account holder is trusted to spend back to zero. In mainstream economics high bank balances are rewarded (with interest), but the celebrated members of mutual credit systems are both earning and spending.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

==Governance of mutual credit systems==
Mutual credit governance all stems from a single question, how much each member can be trusted.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}} With no trust, there is no credit and therefore no transactions. But too much trust may be abused by members who are less serious about closing their accounts on zero - exactly the same as a [[Credit bubble]]. Small and egalitarian systems usually grant every account the same (positive and) negative limits. Some small systems will have a 'house' account which is collectively governed and may have greater limits. Larger systems with less trust between members, greater diversity of members or whose members' livelihoods depend on reciprocation have [[credit rating]] systems of more or less elaborate design.

An addition governance question concerns privacy. What transactions are visible to whom, and what account balances are visible to whom?

==Meaning of 'mutual'==
Practitioners and theoreticians in the complementary currency movement have not yet offered a definition of mutual credit, (The place to do it would be the [http://ijccr.wordpress.com|IJCCR]) and while credit is well enough understood, just what is mutual is wide open to interpretation, it could be:
* as mentioned, that the creditors and debts are the same people
* that the credit risk is a mutual concern to all members of the circle, and the access to [[liquidity]] also
* that every member agrees to honour the same unit of account
* or even that the governance of the credit is participative, if it is.
* That members take some responsibility for each other's successes (or at least ability to return their balances to zero)

==Is mutual credit 'money'?==
[[Money]] is much more than a record of what we have spent and earned. Though the definition of money itself is highly contentious, it is usually important that it be generally exchanged for useful things. What makes a mutual credit accounting system, into something like a money system is the contractual obligation of account holders to close all accounts at zero, which is to say, to depart the system neither owing nor owed.
The [[credit theory of money]] says clearly that money does not need to be, or be backed by, commodities like gold. Mutual credit systems can perform, reasonably well, all of the three classical [[functions of money]], as store of value, medium of exchange and unit of account.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}} And while some heterodox economists such as [[Silvio Gesell]] argue that money should not even be used as a store of value,{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}} as a medium of exchange, mutual credit is unrivalled:
* it actually records how much value has been given and how much received,
* it is more readily available when needed (it doesn't have to be mined and refined first),
* moving 'credit' is simply a matter of adding a ledger entry,
* it provides an incentive for members to help each other exchange (see below),
Note that since mutual credit transactions do not involve the movement of a commodity, are by nature both traceable and reversible, in contrast to say, [[cash]] or [[Bitcoin]].

==Examples and types of systems==
There are three main social institutions said to use mutual credit today, [[trade exchange]]s, [[local exchange trading systems]], and [[timebanking]] associations, each with a number of offshoots and variations, and their own understanding of what mutual credit means.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

The '''Overseas Development Institute''' ('''ODI''') is an independent [[think tank]] on [[international development]] and humanitarian issues, founded in 1960. Based in London, its mission is "to inspire and inform policy and practice which lead to the reduction of poverty, the alleviation of suffering and the achievement of sustainable livelihoods in [[developing countries]]." It does this by "locking together high-quality applied research, practical policy advice, and policy-focused dissemination and debate."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.odi.org.uk/about/mission-values.asp |title=Organisational information – About us – Overseas Development Institute |publisher=ODI |date= |accessdate=6 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 1960 ODI began in small premises in Regent's Park, central London and operated a library devoted to international development issues as well as performing consultancy work and contracts with the [[Department for International Development]] (then known as the Overseas Development Agency) of the UK government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.odi.org.uk/50years/default.asp#timeline |title=at 50 – About ODI – Overseas Development Institute |publisher=ODI |date=9 June 2010 |accessdate=6 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then it has moved several times and is currently{{when|date=January 2015}} on Blackfriars Road.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.odi.org.uk/about/contact-details |title=Contact details and directions – About us – Overseas Development Institute |publisher=ODI |date= |accessdate=9 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2004 it has had a Partnership Programme Arrangement with the UK's Department for International Development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dfid.gov.uk/Documents/funding/ppa/currentppas/odi-ppa-2008-11.pdf?epslanguage=en|title= Partnership Program Arrangement (PPA) between UK Department for International Development (DFID) and Overseas Development Institute (ODI) 2008–2011|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Institute also developed a strong focus on communications and 'bridging research and policy'.&lt;ref&gt;Maxwell, Simon, and Diane L. Stone, eds. Global knowledge networks and international development. Routledge, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007 the ODI was named 'Think Tank of the Year' by ''Public Affairs News'' magazine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.publicaffairsnews.com publicaffairsnews.com]&lt;/ref&gt; It was named 'Think-tank to Watch' in the ''[[Prospect (magazine)|Prospect]]'' 'Think-tank of the Year' awards in 2005 and is considered to be in international policy circles to be one of the world's leading think tanks on development.

=== Fellowship ===
ODI runs a fellowship scheme, which sends young postgraduate economists of all nationalities to work in the public sectors of developing countries in Africa, the Caribbean, South Asia, South East Asia and the Pacific on two-year contracts. Since 1963 ODI has sent over 900 post-graduate economists to work in 40 mostly low-income countries. Participants were initially known as Overseas Development Institute Nuffield Fellows (ODINs) and later titled as ODI Fellows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.odi.org.uk/fellowship-scheme/ |title=Fellowship Scheme – Overseas Development Institute |publisher=ODI |date= |accessdate=6 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Funding===
As a [[registered charity]], ODI's income relies on "grants and donations from foundations, non-governmental organisations, the private sector, governments, multilateral agencies and academia".

For its £28,541,000 income (USD 42,811,000 as of January 2015) per its annual report from 2013 to 2014 ending 31 March 2014,&lt;ref name=report&gt;{{cite web|title=annual report 2013-14|url=http://www.odi.org/sites/odi.org.uk/files/odi-assets/publications-opinion-files/9127.pdf|publisher=Overseas Development Institute|accessdate=25 January 2015|pages=1|format=pdf|date=March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; ODI provided a list of these "major donors", which include Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, Oxfam, PricewaterhouseCoopers, Research Triangle Institute, Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency, Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation, Swiss Federal Government, The Prince's Youth Business International, UN Women, UNICEF, United Nations Development Programme, United Nations Environment Programme, United Nations Food and Agricultural Organization, US Agency for International Development, Wiley-Blackwell, William and Flora Hewlett Foundation, World Bank.&lt;ref name=donors&gt;{{cite web|title=Major donors|url=http://www.odi.org/sites/odi.org.uk/files/odi-assets/publications-opinion-files/9133.pdf|publisher=Overseas Development Institute|accessdate=25 January 2015|pages=1|format=pdf|date=March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
David Steven of Global Dashboard criticised the ODI for not making the distinction between subsidy and having a lower [[VAT]] rate on fuel comparison to other goods.&lt;ref name=GlobalDashboard&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globaldashboard.org/2013/11/07/odi-calls-vat-hike-energy-bills/|title=ODI calls for VAT hike on energy bills (updated: ODI fights back)|publisher=Global Dashboard|accessdate=24 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Parrot astrology''' or '''Parrot fortune-telling''' ({{lang-ta|கிளி ஜோசியம்}}) is a type of [[astrology]] popular among the [[Tamil people|Tamils]] of [[Tamil Nadu]], Telugus in [[Andhra Pradesh]], India and Singapore. It involves using green parakeets which are trained to pick up [[Tarot]] like fortune cards.&lt;ref name=dc/&gt;&lt;ref name=sing/&gt; The parakeets are trained specifically for this. 

==Fortune telling process==
A parrot astrologer/fortune teller typically sits beneath a tree to call or by the side of the road where people congregate in numbers. He has a cage which contains one or two trained parrots. The tarot like cards are either spread out or stacked in front of him. They are 27 in number representing the Indian cosmic system. Each card contains the image of a Hindu deity and some cards contain images of Buddha or Virgin Mary with Infant Jesus. When a patron sits before the fortune teller, the latter opens the cage and lets the parrot out. He instructs the parrot to pick a card for the patron. The parrot walks over to the cards, picks one from the stack or the spread with its beak and gives it to the astrologer. It then walks back inside its cage. The astrologer opens the card and based on the image tells the fortune of the patron.&lt;ref name=dc&gt;{{cite news|title=Art of parrot predictions on verge of extinction|url=http://www.deccanchronicle.com/channels/cities/chennai/art-parrot-predictions-verge-extinction-215|accessdate=23 December 2011|newspaper=[[Deccan Chronicle]]|date=17 October 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120506033522/http://www.deccanchronicle.com/channels/cities/chennai/art-parrot-predictions-verge-extinction-215|archivedate=6 May 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=sing&gt;{{cite web|last=Naidu Ratnala|first=Thulaja|title=Parrot astrologers|url=http://infopedia.nl.sg/articles/SIP_602_2005-01-04.html|work=National Library Board Singapore|accessdate=23 December 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120101025350/http://infopedia.nl.sg/articles/SIP_602_2005-01-04.html|archivedate=1 January 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5850">The '''Polynesian Panther Party''' was a revolutionary movement founded by New Zealand born [[Polynesia]]ns on 16 June 1971.&lt;ref name=stuff&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/sunday-news/news/3806084/Polynesian-Panthers-make-movie |title=Polynesian Panthers make movie |author=Bunting, Finbarr |date=June 13, 2010 |work=stuff.co.nz |accessdate=December 30, 2010 }}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The party was explicitly influenced by the  [[Black Panther Party|American Black Panther Party]], particularly [[Huey Newton]]’s policy of black unity. They located the causes of [[Māori people|Māori]] and [[Pacific Islanders|Pacific Island]] oppression within the exploitative social relations of [[capitalism]]. Consequently, the Polynesian Panthers promoted a strategy of liberation based on the complete overthrow of the capitalist system and the social relations necessary for its development. The group greatly increased in profile during [[Rob Muldoon]]'s immigration scare campaign in 1975, and the subsequent [[dawn raid]]s under his administration.

==Foundation==
The Polynesian Panther Movement was founded in inner city [[Auckland]] by six young [[Pacific]] Islander men: Fred Schmidt, Nooroa Teavae, Paul Dapp, Vaughan Sanft, Eddie Williams and [[Will 'Ilolahia]].&lt;ref name=stuff/&gt; At the time many Pacific Island youth were supporters of [[Māori political initiatives]] such as the [[Bastion Point|Bastion Point occupation]] and [[Waitangi Day]] protests, and gained skills in political lobbying and processes which they used to raise the profile of Pacific people in New Zealand. Because of the working-class background of its members the movement concerned itself with issues relating to unequal pay and unsatisfactory working conditions.

Headquarters were established in [[Ponsonby, New Zealand|Ponsonby]] and the Polynesian Panthers began to organise activities, among them were homework centres for Pacific children, visiting Pacific prisoners as well as providing transport for their families to visit, and running programs educating Pacific Islanders on their rights as New Zealand citizens. Soon the movement expanded nationally with chapters in South Auckland, [[Christchurch]] and [[Dunedin]], as well as a chapter in [[Sydney]], Australia.

One of the notable early members of the Polynesian Panthers include [[Niue]]an composer, musician and activist [[Tigilau Ness]], who was imprisoned during anti-apartheid protests in New Zealand aimed at stopping the controversial [[1981 South Africa rugby union tour of New Zealand|1981 South African Springboks rugby tour]]. Ness is also the father of New Zealand hip hop artist [[Che Fu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/grey-lynn/news/article.cfm?l_id=340&amp;objectid=10391310 |title=Brown Power |author=Masters, Catherine |date=July 15, 2006 |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |accessdate=December 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recent years==
In 2006 Panther members released a book to mark the 35th anniversary of the Polynesian Panther movement.&lt;ref name=stuff/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tvnz.co.nz/content/752642/2483318.html |title=Polynesian Panthers mark 35 years |date=June 17, 2006 |work=[[Television New Zealand]]  |accessdate=December 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 12 September 2009 the Polynesian Panthers held a special evening in Auckland to honour American Black Panther revolutionary artist [[Emory Douglas]] during his International Artist in Residency at [[Auckland University]]'s [[Elam School of Fine Arts]].

In 2010 a documentary film made by Nevak 'Ilolahia (niece of Will 'Ilolahia), was released telling the story of the Polynesian Panthers. It was shown on [[Māori Television]]'s New Zealand documentary slot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://paradiseishell.wordpress.com/2010/10/03/the-polynesian-panther-party-documentary/ |title=The Polynesian Panther Party documentary |date=October 3, 2010 |work=paradiseishell.wordpress.com |publisher= |accessdate=December 30, 2010| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120316155602/http://paradiseishell.wordpress.com/2010/10/03/the-polynesian-panther-party-documentary/ | archivedate=2012-03-16

All prisoners have the basic [[rights]] needed to survive and sustain a reasonable way of life. Most rights are taken away ostensibly so the prison system can maintain order, discipline, and security.{{cn|date=May 2015}} Any of the following rights, given to prisoners, can be taken away for that purpose:

Prisoner may refer to one of the following:
* A person incarcerated in a [[prison]] or [[jail]] or similar facility.
* [[Prisoner of war]], a [[combatant]] or [[non-combatant]] in [[war]]time, held by a [[belligerent]] power
* [[Political prisoner]], someone held in prison for their [[ideology]].
* A person forcibly detained against his will, such as a victim of kidnapping; such prisoners may be held hostage, or held to ransom, but not necessarily in a prison or similar facility.{{cn|date=November 2015}}

The right to: {{cn|date=November 2015}}
* not be punished cruelly or unusually
* due processes
* administrative appeals
* access the [[parole]] process (denied to those incarcerated in the Federal System)
* practice religion freely
* equal protection ([[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]])
* be notified of all charges against them
* receive a written statement explaining [[evidence]] used in reaching a [[disposition]]
* file a [[civil suit]] against another person
* medical treatment (both long and short term)
* treatment that is both adequate and appropriate
* a hearing upon being relocated to the [[mental health facility]].
* [[personal property]] such as: cigarettes, stationary, a watch, cosmetics, and snack-food
* visitation
* [[privacy]]
* food that would sustain an average person adequately. 
* bathe (for sanitation and health reasons).

Many rights are taken away from prisoners often temporarily.{{cn|date=November 2015}} For example, prison personnel are required to read and inspect all in-going or out-going mail, in order to prevent prisoners from obtaining [[contraband]]. The only time a prisoner has a full right to privacy is in conversations with their [[Lawyer|attorney]].

=== History of tourism ===
Costa Rica first began development of its tourism industry with the creation of the first private hotel, the [[Gran Hotel (Costa Rica)|Gran Hotel Costa Rica]], in 1930. Generally, tourists came from overseas, entering the country through the [[Port of Limón]], then commuting to San José by train. On June 16, 1931, Law 91 was passed, creating the National Tourism Board, which operated until it was replaced by the [[Instituto Costarricense de Turismo]] on August 9, 1955.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=General Framework |url=http://www.visitcostarica.com/ict/paginas/TourismBoard.asp |publisher=Instituto Costarricense de Turismo |accessdate=17 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, tourism ranks as Costa Rica’s second highest source of revenue. In 2000, revenue from tourism accounted for 21% of Costa Rica’s total exports. Increasingly, Costa Rica is becoming reliant upon tourism as a source of income; the number of tourists arrivals in 2000 had more than doubled compared to the number of tourists only a decade earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Inman |first=Crist |title=Tourism in Costa Rica: The Challenge of Competitiveness |url=http://www.incae.edu/ES/clacds/publicaciones/pdf/cen653.pdf |publisher=INCAE |accessdate=17 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Prominence ===
Recently, [[Interpol]] named Costa Rica the fastest-growing capital for sex tourism in Latin America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Ercolani |first=Steve |title=Study Looks at Costa Rica's Sex Tourism Industry |url=http://www.ticotimes.net/Current-Edition/News-Briefs/Study-looks-at-Costa-Rica-s-sex-tourism-industry_Thursday-October-04-2012 |publisher=Tico Times |date=4 October 2012 |accessdate=17 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Jacó, Costa Rica|Jacó]] and San José are two of Costa Rica’s most prominent sex tourism locations. Money made by prostitutes is enough to keep the majority of Jacó’s businesses open during the off season, as it provides a significant economic supplement.&lt;ref name="Underground"&gt;{{cite web |last=Strange |first=Cadence |title=The Not So Underground World of Sexual Tourism in Jaco Costa Rica |url=http://news.co.cr/the-not-so-underground-world-of-sexual-tourism-in-jaco-costa-rica/9849/ |publisher=The Costa Rica Star |date=5 July 2012 |accessdate=17 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Americans are the majority of Costa Rica’s sex tourists, composing 80% of the total number of tourists.&lt;ref name="Attractions"&gt;{{cite web  |last=Song |first=Susan |title=Children as Tourist Attractions |url=http://www.yapi.org/rpchildsextourism.pdf |website=Global Child Sex Tourism |publisher=Youth Advocate Program International |accessdate=17 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Violence against prostitutes==
Street violence in Costa Rica is on the rise, and prostitutes are particularly at risk. Acts of violence committed towards prostitutes often go ignored. The issue of violence towards prostitutes is not an issue that goes unnoticed by policy-makers and physicians. Rather, many choose to disregard the plight of these women. Women seeking medical treatment or asylum are generally ignored and thought to be deserving of the violence they suffer. Physicians and doctors who were interviewed openly admitted to disliking prostitutes, with one physician stating these women are "an embarrassment to the country".&lt;ref name=Hurts&gt;{{cite journal |last=Downe |first=Pamela J. |title=Laughing When it Hurts: Humor and Violence in the Lives of Costa Rican Prostitutes|journal= [[Women's Studies International Forum]] |date=2 January 1999 |volume=22 |issue=1 |pages=63–78 |doi=10.1016/s0277-5395(98)00109-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Police officials have expressed a dislike of prostitutes, and are, according to the accounts of some prostitutes, guilty of committing acts of violence, discrimination, and harassment towards prostitutes themselves. Examples of this include rape, false accusations, disinterest in complaints about abuse, and illegal detention.&lt;ref name="Hurts" /&gt;

==Transsexual prostitutes==

[[File:Work areas of trans women prostitutes in San José, Costa Rica.svg|thumb|Work areas of trans women prostitutes in the year 2016, in San José, Costa Rica (in red)]]

According to "Transvida", an organisation which is dedicated to defend the rights of the transsexual population, [[Trans woman|trans women]] who are sex workers in San José, mostly work in 2 defined areas, in 2016. One of those areas centers around "Parque Morazán" and the [[Costa Rica Institute of Technology]] and the other one around the "Ministry Of Public Works &amp; Transport" and the [[Hospital Clínica Bíblica]].&lt;ref name="Trans-abuse"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://vincentverheyen.com/node/32 |title=Transsexuals deal with stones and bullets when they offer sex - Transsexuals report an increase of attacks in the streets of San José [Costa Rica] &amp; 14 police officers accused of abusing authority against trans women |publication-date=28 June 2016 |others=Translated by Vincent Verheyen (source: La Nación) |access-date=24 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2016, transwomen who are sex workers in San José have denounced insults and violence (such as attacks involving stones and [[BB gun]] pellets) committed against them, in a local newspaper. The newspaper article included pictures showing multiple BB gun injuries (pellets penetrated inside the bodies), as well as video interviews with the trans women sex workers.&lt;ref name="Trans-abuse" /&gt;

In another newspaper article, which appeared in the same edition of the newspaper, it was made clear that, since 2015, there had also been 14 complaints filed with the [[Judicial Investigation Department]] against officers for abusing their authority against trans women. Twelve of those accusations were against officials of the "Fuerza Pública" (an policing instance); one against the Judicial Investigation Department; and one against the municipal police.&lt;ref name="Trans-abuse" /&gt;

== HIV/AIDS ==
An estimated 13,800 people were living with [[HIV/AIDS]] in Costa Rica in 2016.&lt;ref name="unaids16"&gt;{{cite web|title=Costa Rica 2016 Country Factsheet|url=http://www.unaids.org/en/regionscountries/countries/costarica/|website=UNAIDS|accessdate=12 April 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionally, tourism has been cited as a contributor to the spread of HIV, and other such [[Sexually transmitted disease]]s. Research has linked sex tourism to the transmission of HIV between worker and client.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Romero-Daza |first1=Nancy |first2=Andrea |last2=Freidus |title=Female Tourists, Casual Sex, and HIV Risk in Costa Rica |journal=Qual Sociol |date=27 March 2008 |issue=31 |pages=169–187 |doi=10.1007/s11133-008-9096-y |volume=31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Teenagers and young adults are the most at risk for infection; presently, people ages 15 to 24 account for over 10% of the number of HIV infected individuals living in Costa Rica.&lt;ref name=Cuidate&gt;{{cite journal |last=Freidus |first=Andrea |title=Cuidate: Tourism, drugs, sex and HIV among young people in Monteverde, Costa Rica |journal=University of South Florida Scholar Commons |date=1 June 2005 |pages=1–118|url=http://scholarcommons.usf.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3882&amp;context=etd |accessdate=17 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== HIV/AIDS awareness programs ===
Since the diagnosis of the first case of HIV in Costa Rica in 1984, the country has run aggressive HIV/AIDS awareness programs. In addition to this, the government has fought to reduce the cost of drugs needed to treat HIV/AIDS patients; since 2003, the government has purchased generic drugs for a much lower cost than other, brand-name drugs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Rosenblum| first=Daniel| title=A Ray Of Hope: Costa Rica's Progressive Approach to HIV/AIDS| url=http://www.umich.edu/~historyj/pages_folder/articles/A_Ray_of_Hope.pdf| publisher=University of Michigan| accessdate=17 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Roman Catholic Church, however, has opposed the Costa Rican Ministry of Public Health’s efforts to institute HIV prevention and sex education programs. The Church believes that married couples are not at risk for infection because adultery is prohibited. In addition, they feel that the campaign for increased condom use and sex education programs interfere with “Divine Rule.”&lt;ref name="Cuidate" /&gt;

=== Perceptions of prostitutes ===
Prostitutes often associate HIV/AIDS infection with violent behavior. The prostitutes interviewed showed a unique and incorrect understanding of HIV/AIDS, in that it was inextricably linked to violence. Prostitutes see violent men as potential sources of infection, by HIV as well as other diseases such as hepatitis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Downe |first=Pamela |title=Constructing a Complex of Contagion: The Perceptions of AIDS among Working Prostitutes in Costa Rica|subscription=yes|journal=Social Science &amp; Medicine |date=May 1997 |volume=44 |issue=10 |pages=1575–1583 |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277953696003899 |accessdate=17 October 2012 |doi=10.1016/S0277-9536(96)00389-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Illegal activities ==
While sex tourism is embraced in Costa Rica due to its economic benefits, there are limits to what is considered lawful conduct. Sex trafficking and child prostitution are problems resulting from the rapid expansion of the sex tourism industry that the Costa Rican government has sought to remedy.&lt;ref name="Underground" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Child&gt;{{cite news | last=Mayedo| first=Isabel| title=The child prostitutes of Costa Rica| url=http://www.theprisma.co.uk/2012/03/04/the-child-prostitutes-of-costa-rica/| accessdate=17 October 2012| newspaper=The prisma| date=4 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recently, the Costa Rican government announced the approval of legislation by congress that would increase penalties for trafficking and related activities. The law also creates a fund designed to combat human trafficking. Minister of the Presidency, Carlos Ricardo Benavides, asserted that "Costa Rica sets a good example" though the implementation of this law, and that human trafficking "must be fought by all possible means."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Costa Rica Passes Law Increasing Punishment for Sexual Tourism and Human Trafficking| url=http://thecostaricanews.com/costa-rica-passes-law-increasing-punishment-for-sexual-tourism-and-human-trafficking/13488| accessdate=17 October 2012| newspaper=The Costa Rica News| date=10 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Child prostitution ===
Costa Rica is a destination for [[child sex tourism]], even though the main source of clients was local, as reported by Tapiana Tregar, CEO of Fundacion Procal (a local NGO attempting to prevent and treat violence against women and children) in a 2000 article. In the same article, Bruce Harris, regional director of Casa Alianza (the Latin American branch of international child care agency Covenant House) said that; even though child prostitution was identified across [[Central America]], the problem seemed to be more "out of control" in Costa Rica. Exact numbers of the children involved were unknown at the time, and the government of Costa Rica had not gathered detailed statistics.&lt;ref&gt;
[https://www.motherjones.com/news/feature/2000/10/costarica.html Innocence for Sale] ''Mother Jones'' 2000-10-10.&lt;/ref&gt;

Costa Rican Congresswoman Gloria Bejerano cites globalization as one of the factors halting attempts to cease child prostitution, as access to communication and media technologies is widespread. While production and distribution of child pornography is a punishable offense, possession of such materials is not.&lt;ref name="Child" /&gt;

The sexual exploitation of children is a significant issue in Costa Rica, and has drawn the attention of the public. Many sex tourists prefer to target children, believing that they are less likely to be infected with HIV. However, children are more susceptible to HIV infection than other age groups. The governmental organization Alianza por tus Derechos (“Alliance for your rights”) pushes for the implementation of new, harsher laws to coincide with the heinousness of the crimes being committed. Very few instances of child prostitution are actually reported to authorities due to the poor categorization of these crimes in legislation.&lt;ref name="Attractions" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Child" /&gt; Since 2004 the government and the tourism industry have implemented several initiatives to curb child prostitution, including education campaigns among tourist industry workers to report any illicit activity regarding minors.&lt;ref name=Wright/&gt; Anyone convicted of buying sex from a minor can suffer prison terms of up to 10 years.&lt;ref name=WPCosta /&gt;

Child prostitution is widespread. [[Street children]] in the urban areas of San José, [[Puerto Limón|Limon]], and [[Puntarenas]] are particularly at risk.&lt;ref name="US state"/&gt; Costa Rica is a transit and destination point for minors and women trafficked  most often for commercial sexual exploitation.  Most trafficking victims originate from Colombia, the Dominican Republic, Nicaragua, and [[Guatemala]].&lt;ref name="US state"/&gt;

Despite attempts by Costa Rican authorities to improve the situation in Costa Rica, their efforts have had little to no effect. Such efforts were the Law Against Organized Crime in 2009, and the Law for Protection of Victims and Witnesses in 2010. Immigration and the District Attorney’s office assert that efforts thus far have been inadequate, as there have only been two human trafficking cases ending in a strict sentence since the passing of these laws. Lawmakers have since redoubled their efforts, unanimously approving the Law Against Human Trafficking, which would raise the maximum penalty of human trafficking to 16 years.&lt;ref name="Stand"&gt;{{cite news|title=Human Trafficking Continues in Costa Rica, as Lawmakers Take a Stand|url=http://insidecostarica.com/2012/10/01/human-trafficking-continues-in-costa-rica-as-lawmakers-take-a-stand/|accessdate=17 October 2012|newspaper=Inside Costa Rica|date=1 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Children find themselves involved in the sex trade through a number of different circumstances: families seeking a better life for their children are tricked by offers from pimps, who later abuse and drug the children to the point of submissiveness, or they can be sold into the trade by neighbors, relatives, or people they considered friends. Abandoned and afraid, these children seldom find their way back home, and the ones who do are usually ostracized from society.&lt;ref name="Attractions" /&gt; In 2016, the phenomenon of fathers "renting" their daughters as child prostitutes has been called common in [[Limón Province]], but occurred throughout the country. The Ministry of Health of Costa Rica regretted that some citizens of Costa Rica do not denounce this practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

=== Sex trafficking ===
{{see also|Human trafficking in Costa Rica}}
According to the 2017 Costa Rica Trafficking in Persons Report, “Costa Rica is a source, transit, and destination country for women and children subjected to sex trafficking.”&lt;ref name="state17"&gt;{{cite web|title=Costa Rica 2017 Trafficking in Persons Report|url=https://www.state.gov/j/tip/rls/tiprpt/countries/2017/271170.htm|website=U.S. Department of State|accessdate=12 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Trafficking victims from other countries sometimes pass through Costa Rica on their way to other destinations in Central and South America. Girls are trafficked from Costa Rica to work as prostitutes in the [[United States]], [[Canada]], and [[Europe]]. High profits contribute to human trafficking being an enduring problem. In some cases, earnings of up to $10,000 have been reported for a single trafficking victim. With an estimated 25 to 40 people being trafficked into and out of Costa Rica per week, human trafficking is a large source of revenue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Costa Rica [PDF download]| url=http://www.protectionproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/Costa-Rica.pdf| publisher=The Protection Project| accessdate=17 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Minors and women trafficked most often for commercial sexual exploitation, and most trafficking victims originate from Colombia, Dominican Republic, Nicaragua and Guatemala.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2008/wha/119154.htm| title=2008 Human Rights Report: Costa Rica| date=2009-02-25| website=Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor| publisher=U.S. Department of State| accessdate=2012-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the past few years, 76 victims of human trafficking operations have been rescued in Costa Rica. However, it is nearly impossible to know just how many victims of human trafficking there are in the country. For each person rescued from a human trafficking operation, there are at least 20 cases that go unreported, according to Costa Rican immigration authorities. This estimate places the number of trafficking victims in Costa Rica in the past few years somewhere around 1,500.&lt;ref name="Stand"/&gt;

Despite attempts by Costa Rican authorities to improve the situation in Costa Rica, their efforts have had little to no effect. Such efforts were the "Law Against Organized Crime" in 2009, and the "Law for Protection of Victims and Witnesses" in 2010. Immigration and the district attorney’s office assert that efforts thus far have been inadequate, as there have only been two human trafficking cases ending in a strict sentence since the passing of these laws. Lawmakers have since redoubled their efforts, unanimously approving the Law Against Human Trafficking, which would raise the maximum penalty of human trafficking to 16 years.&lt;ref name="Stand" /&gt;

The [[United States Department of State]] [[Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons]] ranks Costa Rica as a '[[Trafficking in Persons Report#Ranking System|Tier 2]]' country.&lt;ref name="state18"&gt;{{cite web |title=Costa Rica 2018 Trafficking in Persons Report |url=https://www.state.gov/j/tip/rls/tiprpt/countries/2018/282637.htm |website=U.S. Department of State |accessdate=26 July 2018}}{{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== International responses ===
The [[United Nations]] has been an extremely active force in efforts to prevent human trafficking and child sex tourism in Latin American countries. Article 34 of the UN [[Convention on the Rights of the Child]] addresses children’s fundamental right to be protected from sexual exploitation.&lt;ref name=Social&gt;{{cite journal | last=Tepelus| first=Camelia| title=Social responsibility and innovation on trafficking and child sex tourism: Morphing of practice into sustainable tourism policies?| journal=[[Tourism and Hospitality Research]] |date=10 March 2008 |issue=8| pages=98–115| url=http://www.besteducationnetwork.org/?module=file&amp;act=procFileDownload&amp;file_srl=11116&amp;sid=0289f181911280cbeb8139177353b3a4&amp;module_srl=879| accessdate=17 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CRC was introduced in 1989 and is currently ratified by all but two of the world’s nations. In 2000, an Optional Protocol to the CRC on the Sale of Children, Child Prostitution and Child Pornography was introduced. Many of the articles in the CRC concern the sexual exploitation of children, and the rights of children to be protected from such activities.&lt;ref name="Attractions" /&gt;

In 1999, the [[International Labour Organization]] Convention coordinated massive efforts to eradicate many forms of child labor, including the sale and [[trafficking of children]], as well as the sexual exploitation of children for pornography or prostitution.&lt;ref name="Attractions" /&gt;

Many countries sought to strengthen existing laws regarding the exploitation of children. Facing pressure from various child welfare groups, the United States passed the [[PROTECT Act]] in April 2003. The act made it illegal for U.S. citizens to travel to another country to have sex, or to conspire to have sex, with a minor. The law also raised the maximum sentence of individuals who either engaged in, or attempted to engage in, sex with a minor to 30 years.

Since 2004, [[World Vision]], a Christian [[humanitarian organization]] operating in nearly 100 countries, has run a campaign to prevent child sex tourism, and to raise awareness of legislation regarding child sex tourism. Under the slogan “‘Abuse a child in this country, go to jail in yours,’” World Vision launched a campaign to deter child sex tourists in Cambodia, Thailand, Costa Rica, Mexico,  and Brazil.&lt;ref name="Social" /&gt; The campaign, termed the Child Sex Tourism Prevention Project, was conducted in cooperation with various U.S. government agencies. The project sought to deter sex tourists through various in-flight advertisements and brochure, billboard, and other media warning sex tourists that they are subject to prosecution.&lt;ref name="Attractions" /&gt;

Also in 2004, the [[World Tourism Organization]] (WTO), in conjunction with [[ECPAT]] and [[UNICEF]], headed an effort to encourage American travel agencies to abide by a code of conduct. Under the code, hotel and travel companies commit to establishing a policy against commercial sexual exploitation of children.&lt;ref name="Attractions" /&gt;

The '''seven necessities''' (Chinese: 開門七件事 pinyin: kai men qi jian shi) stem from the phrase "Firewood, rice, oil, salt, sauce, vinegar and tea are the seven necessities to begin a day". The items were known as early as the [[Song dynasty]] travel book, [[Dongjing Meng Hua Lu|Dreams of the Former Capital]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Huang (Huang Xingzong), H.T.  |first =  |year = 2000 |title = [https://books.google.com/books?id=FgtFxedkgbcC&amp;q=salt+#v=snippet&amp;q=seven%20necessities&amp;f=false Fermentations and Food Science] |publisher = Cambridge University Press| location = Cambridge |ref = harv}} p. 394.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chinese phrase "seven necessities" literally means "開open 門 door 七seven 件事items" when translated, which is an old Chinese saying. They include  firewood (柴 chái), rice (米 mĭ), oil (油 yóu), salt (鹽yán), sauce (醬 jiàng), vinegar (醋 cù), tea (茶 chá). The seven necessities were made popular in modern [[tea culture]] due to the fact the beverage was mentioned as one of the seven necessities of Chinese life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chinese Tea Culture, Tea Drinking Custom, Tea Tasting, Yum Cha|url=http://www.travelchinaguide.com/intro/cuisine_drink/tea/culture.htm|publisher=Travel China Guide|accessdate=2 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Substance abuse''', also known as '''drug abuse''', is a patterned use of a substance (drug) in which the user consumes the substance in amounts or with methods which are harmful to themselves or others. 
The drugs used are often associated with levels of intoxication that alter judgment, perception, attention and physical control, not related with medical  effects.  It is often thought that the main abused substances are illegal drugs and alcohol; however it is becoming more common that prescription drugs and tobacco are a prevalent problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Substance Abuse and Addiction Health Center |url= http://www.webmd.com/mental-health/addiction/substance-abuse | date=2014-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Substance-related disorders''', including both substance dependence and substance abuse, can lead to large societal problems. It is found to be greatest in individuals ages 18–25, with a higher likelihood occurring in men compared to women, and urban residents compared to rural residents. On average, general medical facilities hold 20% of patients with substance-related disorders, possibly leading to psychiatric disorders later on. Over 50% of individuals with substance-related disorders will often have a "dual diagnosis," where they are diagnosed with the substance abuse, as well as a psychiatric diagnosis, the most common being major depression, personality disorder, anxiety disorders, and dysthymia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Leikin|first=J.B.|title=Substance-Related Disorders in Adults|journal=Disease-a-month|year=2007|volume=53|issue=6|pages=313–335|doi=10.1016/j.disamonth.2007.04.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Signs and symptoms==

Common symptoms include:
*	Sudden changes in behaviour – may engage in secretive or suspicious behaviour 
*	Mood changes – anger towards others, paranoia and little care shown about themselves or their future
*	Problems with work or school – lack of attendance 
*	Changes in eating and sleeping habits 
*	Changes in friendship groups and poor family relationships 
*	A sudden unexplained change in financial needs – leading to borrowing/stealing money

There are many more symptoms such as physical and psychological changes, though this is often dependent on which drug is being abused. It is, however, common that abusers will experience unpleasant withdrawal symptoms if the drug is taken away from them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Drug Abuse and Dependence Symptoms| url= http://www.webmd.com/mental-health/addiction/tc/drug-abuse-and-dependence-symptoms|accessdate= April 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Drug Abuse and Addiction | url = http://www.helpguide.org/articles/addiction/drug-abuse-and-addiction.htm |accessdate = April 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also reported that others have strong cravings even after they have not used the drug for a long period of time. This is called being "clean". To determine how the brain triggers these cravings, multiple tests have been done on mice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Aldhous|first=Peter|title='Drug binge' mice reveal why cravings linger|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn13630-drug-binge-mice-reveal-why-cravings-linger.html|accessdate=2011-10-08|newspaper=Newscientist|date=2008-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is also now thought that these cravings can be explained by substance-related disorders as a subcategory of personality disorders as classified by the DSM-5.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal | author = American Psychiatric Publishing | title = Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (Fifth ed.) | date = 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classification and terminology==

Substance-related disorders were originally subcategorized into "[[substance use disorder]]s" (SUD) and "substance-induced disorders" (SID).&lt;ref&gt;{{DorlandsDict|nine/100010056|substance-related disorders}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GalanterKleber2008"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Marc Galanter|author2=Herbert D. Kleber|title=The American Psychiatric Publishing textbook of substance abuse treatment|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6wdJgejlQzYC&amp;pg=PA59|accessdate=23 April 2010|year=2008|publisher=American Psychiatric Pub|isbn=978-1-58562-276-4|pages=59}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though [[DSM-IV]] makes a firm distinction between the two, SIDs often occur in the context of SUDs.&lt;ref name="FirstFrances2004"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Michael B. First|author2=Allen Frances|author3=Harold Alan Pincus|title=DSM-IV-TR guidebook|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hU_L1KUsNfIC&amp;pg=PA123|accessdate=23 April 2010|year=2004|publisher=American Psychiatric Pub|isbn=978-1-58562-068-5|pages=123–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Substance-induced disorders===

Substance-induced disorders include medical conditions that can be directly attributed to the use of a substance.&lt;ref&gt;{{DorlandsDict|nine/100010072|Substance-induced disorders}}&lt;/ref&gt; These conditions include [[Substance intoxication|intoxication]], [[Drug withdrawal|withdrawal]], [[substance-induced delirium]], [[substance-induced psychosis]], and [[substance-induced mood disorder]]s.&lt;ref name="Shaner2000"&gt;{{cite book|author=Roderick Shaner|title=Psychiatry|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JxYg4ON0CsMC&amp;pg=RA1-PA85|accessdate=23 April 2010|date=1 April 2000|publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins|isbn=978-0-683-30766-5|pages=1–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Substance use disorders===
{{Main|Substance use disorder}}

Substance use disorders include substance abuse and [[substance dependence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{DorlandsDict|nine/100010058|Substance use disorders}}&lt;/ref&gt; In DSM-IV, the conditions are formally diagnosed as one or the other, but it has been proposed that [[DSM-V]] combine the two into a single condition called "Substance-use disorder".&lt;ref name="urlProposed Revision | APA DSM-5"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dsm5.org/ProposedRevisions/Pages/proposedrevision.aspx?rid=431# |title=Proposed Revision &amp;#124; APA DSM-5 |format= |work= |accessdate=2010-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Changes in Classification===

The more recently published [[DSM-5]] combined substance abuse and substance dependence into a single continuum; this is simply known as substance use disorder and requires more presenting symptoms before a diagnosis is made.  It also considers each different substance as its own separate disorder, based upon the same basic criteria.  It also distinguishes the difference between dependence and addictions as two separate disorders, not to be confused.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal | author = American Psychiatric Publishing | title = Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (Fifth ed. )|url = http://www.dsm5.org/Documents/Substance%20Use%20Disorder%20Fact%20Sheet.pdf | date = 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Potential Complications===

There are many potential complications that can arise due to substance abuse such as severe physiological damage, psychological changes and social changes that are often not desirable.

Physiological damage is often the most obvious, observed as an abnormal condition affecting the body of an organism: For instance, there are several known alcohol-induced diseases (e.g. [[alcoholic hepatitis]], [[alcoholic liver disease]], [[alcoholic cardiomyopathy]].)  Substance abuse is also often associated with premature ageing, fertility complications, brain damage and a higher risk of infectious diseases due to a weakened immune system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Baignet |first=Michael | title = Physical complications of substance abuse: what psychiatrists need to know | journal = Current Opinion in Psychiatry | url = http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/452724_2|accessdate=April 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Drug Addictions: complications | url = http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/drug-addiction/basics/complications/con-20020970 |accessdate= April 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Long term abuse has been linked to personality changes such as depression, paranoia, anxiety which can be related to psychological disorders. It is often reported that substance abuse coincides with personality disorders, such as [[borderline personality disorder]]. It has also now been linked to severe brain damage leading to an inability to control behaviours, which could explain why many people who abuse substances go on to develop addictions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Drug Abuse and Dependence Symptoms | url= http://www.webmd.com/mental-health/addiction/tc/drug-abuse-and-dependence-symptoms|accessdate=April 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Trull |last2= Sher |last3= Minks Brown | last4=Durbin |last5=Burr | title = Borderline personality disorder and substance use disorder: A review and integration | journal = Clinical Psychology Review|year=2000|volume=20|issue=2|pages=235–253| doi=10.1016/s0272-7358(99)00028-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Jentsch |first1=j.d. |last2=Taylor |first2 =J. R. | title = impulsivity resulting from frontostriatal dysfunction in drug abuse: implications for the control of behaviour by reward related stimuli | journal = psychopharmacology |year=1999|volume=146|issue=4|pages=373–390|doi=10.1007/pl00005483}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Substance abuse is often regarded as negative in society and therefore those who engage in such behaviours can often be subject to social discrimination. The use of many drugs can lead to criminal convictions, whether the drug itself is illegal or abusers use unlawful methods to fund their substances. It is also more likely that someone will partake in criminal or anti-social behaviour when they are under the influence of a drug.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Drug Abuse and Dependence Symptoms| url= http://www.webmd.com/mental-health/addiction/tc/drug-abuse-and-dependence-symptoms| date=2014-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''tubeteika''' ({{lang-ru|тюбете́йка}}) is a [[Russian language|Russian]] word for many varieties of traditional [[Central Asia]]n [[cap]]s. Tubeteikas are today worn in [[Tajikistan]], [[Kazakhstan]], [[Kyrgyzstan]], and [[Uzbekistan]], as well as in Muslim-populated regions of [[Russia]] (mainly [[Tatars]]) and [[Azerbaijan]]. The skullcap worn by Uzbeks and Uyghurs is called a [[doppa]] and has a square base.

Tubeteikas are worn typically by the [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] ethnic groups of the region. It bears some superficial resemblance to the [[yurt]], another Central Asian cultural icon.

The ''-ka'' at the end is a Russian [[diminutive suffix]], as with ''[[wikt:shapka|shapka]]'', ''[[ushanka]]'' and ''[[budenovka]]''. In [[Turkmen language|Turkmen]], it is called ''tahiya'' ("[[Taqiyah_(cap)|taqiyah]]").

There have been [https://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/Review/responses/ETHIOPIA-English.pdf several] studies concerning '''women in Ethiopia'''. Historically, elite women in [[Ethiopia]] have been visible as administrators and warriors. This never translated into any benefit to improve the rights of women, but it had meant that women could inherit and own property, and act as advisors on important communal matters. As late as the first part of the nineteenth century, Queen Menen, consort of [[Emperor of Ethiopia|Emperor]] [[Iyasu IV]], had a decisive role in running the [[Ethiopian Empire]]. Workit and Mestayit regents to their minor sons have been held responsible for their provinces. They owed their rights to property because of a special type of land tenure that expected tenants to serve as militia to overlords, irrespective of gender. Women in the ensuing period continued in traditional family and household roles, working in the homestead, raising children, and preparing the ingredients for traditional [[Cuisine of Ethiopia|Ethiopian cuisine]].&lt;ref name=cs&gt;Abate, Yohannis. "The Role of Women". ''[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/ettoc.html A Country Study: Ethiopia]'' (Thomas P. Ofcansky and LaVerle Berry, editors). [[Library of Congress]] [[Federal Research Division]] (1991). ''This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the [[public domain]].''[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/about.html].&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, there has been a steady increase in female representation in education, politics and other fields.&lt;ref name="Moeesaoen"/&gt;

==Social role of women==
[[File:Azeb and Meseret.jpg|thumb|left|Ethiopian women in [[Addis Ababa]].]]
As in other traditional societies, in Ethiopia a woman's worth is measured in terms of her role both as a [[mother]] and [[wife]]. Over 85 percent of Ethiopian women reside in rural areas, where households are engaged primarily in subsistence agriculture. In the countryside, women are integrated into the rural economy, which is often labor-intensive and exacts a heavy physical toll on all, including children. The [[Derg|Ethiopian Revolution]] had little impact on the lives of rural women. [[Land reform in Ethiopia|Land reform]] did not change their socioeconomic status, which was anchored in deep-rooted traditional values and beliefs. An improvement in economic conditions would improve the standard of living of women, but lasting change would also require a transformation in the attitudes of government officials and men regarding the roles of women.&lt;ref name=cs/&gt;
[[File:Habesha woman-c.jpg|thumb|left|Ethiopian woman in traditional attire.]]
In urban areas, women have greater access to [[Education in Ethiopia|education]], [[Health care in Ethiopia|health care]] and employment outside the home. According to a 1976 government survey, around 40 percent of employed women in urban areas worked in the service sector, mainly in hotels, restaurants, and bars. A few women with higher education also found professional employment. Employment in production and related areas (such as textiles and food processing) accounted for 25 percent of the female work force, followed by sales, which accounted for about 11 percent. The survey also found that women factory workers in [[Addis Ababa]] earned about a quarter of the wages men earned for the same type of work. These differences existed despite a 1975 proclamation stipulating [[equal pay for equal work]] for men and women.&lt;ref name=cs/&gt;

Following the Ethiopian Revolution, women made some gains in economic and political areas. The [[Revolutionary Ethiopian Women's Association]] (REWA), which claimed a membership of over 5 million, took an active part in educating women. It encouraged the creation of women's organizations in factories, local associations, and in the civil service. Some women participated in local organizations and in peasant associations and [[kebele]]s. However, the role of women was limited at the national level. In 1984, for example, the government selected only one woman as a full member of the Central Committee of the [[Workers' Party of Ethiopia]]. Of the 2,000 delegates who attended the party's inaugural congress in 1984, only 6 percent were women.&lt;ref name=cs/&gt;

Under the [[Derg]], the enrollment of girls in primary and secondary schools increased from about 32 percent in 1974/75 to 39 percent in 1985/86; the enrollment rate among girls in urban areas far exceeded that of girls in rural areas.&lt;ref name=cs/&gt; The adult literacy rate also rose to 60 percent following a nationwide educational campaign.&lt;ref name="Ehatal"&gt;{{cite web|title=Attention to adult literacy|url=http://www.ethpress.gov.et/herald/index.php/herald/society/2200-attention-to-adult-literacy|publisher=Ethiopian Herald|accessdate=20 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the Derg's ouster, the adult literacy rate dropped to around 39 percent as of 2007; 28.9% for females and 49.1% for males.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2103.html|title=The World Factbook — Central Intelligence Agency|author=|date=|website=www.cia.gov|accessdate=5 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, the Ministry of Education launched a new educational campaign, which targets an eventual literacy rate of 95 percent and aims to educate 17 million adults.&lt;ref name="Ehatal"/&gt; As of 2008-2009, there was a steady increase in general enrollment and a decrease in gender disparity in access to education. The average annual growth rate of enrollment in all levels education was 27.2 percent for females and 33.7 percent for males, with an average annual growth rate of 29.7 percent for girls in Kindergarten, 13.4 percent for girls in primary school, 30.8 percent for girls in secondary school, 14.5 percent for women in TVET, and 21.4 percent for women in higher education.&lt;ref name="Moeesaoen"&gt;{{cite web|title=Education Statistics Annual Abstract 2001 E.C. /2008-09 G.C./|url=http://www.moe.gov.et/English/Resources/Documents/esaa01.pdf|publisher=Ministry of Education|accessdate=20 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the formation of the Federal Republic in 1995, the Ministry of Women's Affairs was also established. As of October 2009, Muferiat Kamil serves as the Minister.&lt;ref&gt;[http://moinfo.gov.et/English/publication.php?Main_Page_Number=2541&amp;Doc_Type=English "House Approves Appointment Of Nine Ministers"] (accessed 14 April 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Health and fertility==

The [[HIV/AIDS]] rate for both genders was estimated at 1.3% in 2012.&lt;ref name="cia.gov"/&gt; More women are infected than men, and infections among women are partly due to their often lower socioeconomic status.&lt;ref name="countryoffice.unfpa.org"&gt;http://countryoffice.unfpa.org/ethiopia/drive/WomenandGirlsandHIV-AIDSinEthiopia.pdf{{full|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since sex between spouses is traditionally regarded as an obligation, the UNFPA argues that married women are at a greater risk of contracting HIV as they have less control over the frequency and nature of such relations.&lt;ref name="countryoffice.unfpa.org"/&gt;

An UN analysis of several international studies suggests that domestic [[violence against women]] is most prevalent in Ethiopia.&lt;ref&gt;http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/6040180.stm{{full|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sexual violence is also reportedly common.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bekele AB, van Aken MA, Dubas JS |title=Sexual violence victimization among female secondary school students in eastern Ethiopia |journal=Violence and Victims |volume=26 |issue=5 |pages=608–30 |year=2011 |pmid=22145540 |doi=10.1891/0886-6708.26.5.608 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Misganaw AC, Worku YA |title=Assessment of sexual violence among street females in Bahir-Dar town, North West Ethiopia: a mixed method study |journal=BMC Public Health |volume=13 |issue= |pages=825 |year=2013 |pmid=24020491 |pmc=3856445 |doi=10.1186/1471-2458-13-825 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Article 620 of the 2004 Criminal Code of Ethiopia, defines rape differently as compelled "sexual intercourse outside wedlock".&lt;ref name="refworld.org"&gt;http://www.refworld.org/pdfid/49216b572.pdf{{full|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Article 53 of the 2000 Revised Family Code of Ethiopia also stipulates that "they [the wife and husband] shall have with one another the sexual relations normal in marriage unless these relations involve a risk of seriously prejudicing their health".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.refworld.org/cgi-bin/texis/vtx/rwmain?page=type&amp;type=LEGISLATION&amp;publisher=&amp;coi=ETH&amp;docid=4c0ccc052&amp;skip=0%7B%7Bfull%7D%7D|title=Refworld - Ethiopia: Proclamation No. 213/2000 of 2000, The Revised Family Code|first=United Nations High Commissioner for|last=Refugees|date=|website=refworld.org|accessdate=5 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is interpreted as rendering [[marital rape]] a legally impossible concept.&lt;ref&gt;''Law of Family - Teaching Material''. pp. 76 "The RFC also requires the spouses to have sexual relations normal in marriage unless these relations involve a risk of seriously prejudicing their health. As a result of this obligation, one cannot talk of marital rape under the Ethiopian law."[https://chilot.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/family-law-teaching-material.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; According to a 2005 WHO study, 59% of women reported lifetime sexual abuse by a partner, while one third of women reported that during the past 12 months they were physically forced to have sex against their will with their partner. This was the highest prevalence of all countries surveyed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.who.int/gender/violence/who_multicountry_study/summary_report/summary_report_English2.pdf?ua=1 WHO Multi-country Study on Women's Health and Domestic Violence against Women - Initial results on prevalence, health outcomes and women's responses] WHO&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[World Health Organization]], as of 2005, 74.3% of women aged 15 – 49 years had undergone [[female genital mutilation]] (FGM).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.who.int/reproductivehealth/topics/fgm/prevalence/en/{{full|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pre-marital custom is mainly endemic to [[Northeast Africa]] and parts of the [[Near East]] and has its ultimate origins in [[Ancient Egypt]].&lt;ref name="Rohayes"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Rose Oldfield Hayes |year=1975|title=Female genital mutilation, fertility control, women's roles, and the patrilineage in modern Sudan: a functional analysis |journal=American Ethnologist |volume=2 |issue=4 |pages=617–33 |doi=10.1525/ae.1975.2.4.02a00030 |jstor=643328 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bodman"&gt;Herbert L.

Encouraged and performed by women in the community, circumcision is primarily intended to deter promiscuity and to offer protection from assault.&lt;ref name="Frayser"&gt;Suzanne G.

[[Bride kidnapping]] is practiced by certain communities in Ethiopia, mainly in the [[Southern Nations, Nationalities and People's Region]] (SNNPR). According to surveys conducted in 2003 by the National Committee on Traditional Practices in Ethiopia, the custom's prevalence rate in the SNNPR was estimated at 92 percent.&lt;ref name="Esfm"&gt;{{cite web|title=ETHIOPIA: Surviving forced marriage|url=http://www.irinnews.org/report/69993/ethiopia-surviving-forced-marriage|publisher=IRIN|accessdate=20 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the 2004 Criminal Code criminalizes this practice, as well as other forms of abuse of women, such as child marriage, trafficking and sexual harassment, at ''Chapter III – Crimes Committed against life, person and health through harmful traditional practices'' (Articles 561–570) and also by other provisions (Articles 587, 597, 625, 635, 637, 648). Wife-beating is also illegal: ''Article 564 – Violence Against a Marriage Partner or a Person Cohabiting in an Irregular Union''.&lt;ref name="refworld.org"/&gt;

The 2014 gang rape and [[death of Hanna Lalango]], as well as several other contemporaneous high-profile sexual assaults, prompted outrage from women in Ethiopia and internationally.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2014/dec/11/violence-ethiopia-girls-justice-for-hanna|title=Kidnapped, raped and left for dead: who will protect Ethiopia's girls?|last=Wegayehu|first=Rediet|date=2014-12-11|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Yellow Movement]] was founded as a response to encourage women to speak out against sexual violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.ie/world-news/africa/the-faces-behind-the-yellow-movement-how-ethiopias-young-women-are-vowing-to-change-culture-of-sexual-harassment-rape-and-domestic-violence-36380993.html|title=The faces behind the Yellow Movement: How Ethiopia’s young women are vowing to change culture of sexual harassment, rape and domestic violence - Independent.ie|work=Independent.ie|access-date=2018-07-05|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/jan/27/ethiopia-women-violence-rape-murder|title=Ethiopia's women vow to turn tide of violence, rape and murder {{!}} William Davison|last=Davison|first=William|date=2015-01-27|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fighting for Gender Equality==
Gender equality has been a problem in Ethiopia for decades but has had an improvement over the past three years since when Mulatu Teshome became president.{{When|date=July 2018}} The USAID is one of the worldwide countries that have done a lot in promoting women in Ethiopia and giving them an opportunity to live a better life without discrimination. Other international organizations working with Ethiopia include All African Women For Peace (AAWP) and many others part of the UN keeping their focus on advancing the participation of women in peacemaking and strive to stop early marriages and gender-based violence. In addition to the international help and participation, the Ethiopian government has also created some organizations such as the Ethiopian Women Association (EWA) which mainly focuses on stopping some dangerous cultural practises done against women and girls like FGM which involves removing some parts of their private parts and promoting their economic, social and legal rights. The Ethiopians as individuals have also created smaller local organizations such the Women Fight in Harar, a small city in Ethiopia who have lately been trying to fight any parents who keep their from school and putting shame to men who attack, rape or try to rape girls and women.        
Furthermore, Ethiopian girls and women’s struggles and problems are mostly associated with social acceptance, access to education and child or forced marriages. To many, it seems the tragedy begins immediately when they are born because when a mother gives birth to a baby girl, the baby is considered as something unwanted but celebrations are made when a baby boy is born. Being taken as the weak creatures, parents give various excuses to keep their daughters at home doing housework instead of going to school. A school age girl won’t be allowed to attend school with an excuse that she may be raped, abducted or harmed on the way to school and on the other hand, boys are considered strong   enough to protect themselves from any attack or harm. Girls also can’t choose when and who to get married to. “Either the parents will choose the bride, or the groom will marry the girl of his choice” (Womankind). Though these issues are pretty serious, the worst part of their social acceptance is that a woman who is a victim of rape will face humiliation starting from the police. Rape is not taken seriously and hence men are seen committing several atrocious violence against women, especially in villages.

==Controversies==
This conference didn't get the approval from the International Association for Tamil Research. Not all agreed with the academic and intellectual rigor of the latter event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.srilankaguardian.org/2010/06/karunanidhi-and-politics-of-tamil.html |title=Karunanidhi and the politics of Tamil culture |publisher=Sri Lanka Guardian |date= |accessdate=2012-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=transCurrents on June 15, 2010 05:22 AM |url=http://transcurrents.com/tc/2010/06/world_tamil_classical_conferen.html |title=World Tamil Classical Conference in Tamil Nadu Will Boost Chief Minister Karunanidhi's Image |publisher=transCurrents |date=2010-06-15 |accessdate=2012-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/the-political-uses-of-tamil/638301/0 |title=The political uses of Tamil |publisher=Indian Express |date=2010-06-25 |accessdate=2012-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The conference and associated activities also faced oppositions and criticisms from various political parties and public. The conference was held to divert people's attention from Sri Lankan War crimes and executed by then Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu.&lt;ref&gt;Iqbal Mohideen.

the map represents state-of-the art knowledge of the time, actively collected from Portuguese sources by the makers of the [[Dieppe maps]] during the 1540s to 1560s. The presentation of ''[[Terra Australis]]'' is conventional, imagined as attaching to the [[Strait of Magellan]]. A possible sighting of Australia prior to 1560 has been discussed in scholarship but is mostly considered unlikely. The interior of Africa was at the time largely unexplored and is filled in with partially fictional geography.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

A '''world map''' is a [[map]] of most or all of the surface of the [[Earth]]. World maps form a distinctive category of maps due to the problem of [[Map projection|projection]]. Maps by necessity distort the presentation of the earth's surface. These distortions reach extremes in a world map. The many ways of projecting the earth reflect diverse technical and aesthetic goals for world maps.&lt;ref name="ACA1988"&gt;
{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

World maps are also distinct for the global knowledge required to construct them. A meaningful map of the world could not be constructed before the European [[Renaissance]] because less than half of the earth's coastlines, let alone its interior regions, were known to any culture. New knowledge of the Earth's surface has been accumulating ever since and continues to this day.

Maps of the world generally focus either on political features or on physical features. Political maps emphasize territorial boundaries and human settlement. Physical maps show [[geography|geographic]] features such as [[mountains]], [[soil type]] or [[land use]]. [[Geological map]]s show not only the surface, but characteristics of the underlying rock, [[Geologic fault|fault]] lines, and subsurface structures. [[Choropleth map]]s use color hue and intensity to contrast differences between regions, such as demographic or economic statistics.

==Map projections==
{{Cleanup gallery|date=October 2018}}
{{further|Map projection}}
{{see also|List of map projections}}

A map is made using a map projection, which is any method of representing a [[globe]] on a plane. All projections distort distances and directions, and each projection distributes those distortions differently. Perhaps the most well known projection is the [[Mercator Projection]], originally designed as a [[nautical chart]].

[[Early world maps]] cover depictions of the [[world]] from the [[Iron Age]] to the [[Age of Discovery]] and the emergence of modern [[geography]] during the [[early modern period]]. Old maps provide much information about what was known in times past, as well as the philosophy and cultural basis of the map, which were often much different from modern cartography. Maps are one means by which scientists distribute their ideas and pass them on to future generations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://academic.emporia.edu/aberjame/map/h_map/h_map.htm|title=History of maps and cartography|work=emporia.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;
