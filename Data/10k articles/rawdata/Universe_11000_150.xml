      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2816">The '''Alaska Wilderness League''' (AWL) is a [[nonprofit]] organization that works to protect Alaska’s most significant wild lands from oil and gas drilling and from other industrial threats. Founded in 1993, AWL has its main office in Washington, DC, with additional offices in [[Anchorage]] and [[Juneau]], Alaska.

For the past ten years, AWL has taken the lead in the fight to protect the [[Arctic National Wildlife Refuge]] from being opened to oil and gas development, and its leadership has made a significant impact in this area. The organization has rallied public support and successfully stopped numerous attempts by Congress to open the refuge to development.

In 2001, AWL and its supporters helped fund photographer [[Subhankar Banerjee]]’s ground-breaking winter field photography in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. The photos he took were published in the book ''Seasons of Life and Land''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Subhankar Banerjee|title=Seasons of Life and Land|publisher=Mountaineer Books|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Banerjee’s photographs of the Refuge were exhibited at the [[Smithsonian Institution]]’s [[National Museum of Natural History]], and controversy erupted when his captions for the photos were altered and the exhibit was moved to a far corner of the museum. Some charged that Alaska Senator [[Ted Stevens]] had used political pressure to remove the exhibit from the spotlight because Senator [[Barbara Boxer]] had held up Banerjee’s book during a Senate floor debate over oil drilling in the Refuge, but the museum maintained the changes were made “for artistic reasons”.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2003/05/21/us/censorship-and-politics-views-differ-over-exhibit.html Censorship or Politics? Views Differ Over Exhibit]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Starting in 2004, AWL expanded its work to include ecologically significant areas of  Alaska’s vast [[National Petroleum Reserve]], the [[Tongass National Forest]], and the [[outer continental shelf]] areas of the [[Beaufort Sea|Beaufort]] and [[Chukchi Sea|Chukchi]] Seas.

AWL's work has had long-standing support from President [[Jimmy Carter]], who remains the Honorary Chairman of the Board of Directors.

'''Bluing''', '''laundry blue''', '''dolly blue''' or '''washing blue''' is a household product used to improve the appearance of [[textiles]], especially [[white]] fabrics. Used during [[Laundry|laundering]], it adds a trace of [[blue]] [[dye]] (often synthetic [[ultramarine]], sometimes [[Prussian blue]]) to the fabric.

== Uses ==
[[File:M0354 1951-77-038 2.jpg|thumbnail|left|Laundry bluing kit from France, with the bluing pellets.]]
White fabrics acquire a slight color cast after use (usually [[grey]] or [[yellow]]). Since blue and yellow are [[complementary colors]] in the [[subtractive color]] model of [[color perception]], adding a trace of blue color to the slightly off-white color of these fabrics makes them appear whiter.  [[Laundry detergent]]s may also use [[Fluorescent brightener|fluorescing agents]] to similar effect. Many white fabrics are blued during manufacturing. Bluing is not permanent and rinses out over time leaving dingy or yellowed whites. A commercial bluing product allows the consumer to add the bluing back into the fabric to restore whiteness.

On the same principle, bluing is sometimes used by white-haired people in a [[blue rinse]].

Bluing has other miscellaneous household uses, including as an ingredient in rock [[crystal]] "gardens" (whereby a porous item is placed in a [[salt (chemistry)|salt]] [[solution]], the solution then precipitating out as crystals), and to improve the appearance of [[swimming pool|swimming-pool]] [[water]]. In [[Australia]] it was used as a [[folk remedy]] to relieve the itching of [[mosquito]] and [[sand fly]] bites.

Laundry bluing is made of a colloid of ferric ferrocyanide (blue iron salt, also referred to as "Prussian blue") in water. 

Blue colorings have been added to rinse water for centuries, first in the form of powder blue or [[smalt]], or using small lumps of [[indigo]] and starch, called stone blue. After the invention of synthetic [[ultramarine]] and [[Prussian blue]] it was manufactured by many companies, including [[Mrs. Stewart's Bluing]] in the US, [[Reckitt Benckiser|Reckitt's]] Crown Blue in [[Kingston upon Hull|Hull]] and the Lancashire Ultramarine Company's Dolly Blue at [[Backbarrow]] (later purchased by Reckitt &amp; Sons).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

  |year=1958
  |page=75
}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was popular until the mid-twentieth century in the UK and US, and is still widely used in [[India]] and [[Pakistan]].  In many places, it has been replaced by [[bleach]] for its primary purpose.

Bluing is usually sold in [[liquid]] form, but it may also be a [[solid]].  Solid bluing is sometimes used by [[hoodoo (folk magic)|hoodoo]] doctors to provide the blue color needed for "[[Mojo (African-American culture)|mojo hand]]s" without having to use the [[Toxicity|toxic]] compound [[copper(II) sulfate]].  Bluing was also used by some Native American tribes to mark their arrows showing tribe ownership.{{Citation needed|date=September 2014}}

{{hatnote|"Camel caravan" redirects here. Not to be confused with ''[[Camel Caravan]]'', a former radio program.}}
A '''camel train''' or '''caravan''' is a series of [[camel]]s carrying passengers and/or goods on a regular or semi-regular service between points. Although they rarely travelled faster than the walking speed of a person, camels' ability to withstand harsh conditions made them ideal for communication and trade in the desert areas of [[North Africa]] and the [[Arabian Peninsula]] for centuries. Camel trains were also used sparingly elsewhere around the globe. Since the early 20th century they have been largely replaced by motorized vehicles or air traffic.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/from_our_own_correspondent/6070400.stm BBC: "Dying trade of the Sahara camel train" (2006)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Africa, Asia and the Middle East==
{{See also|Bedouin|Trans-Saharan trade|Silk Road}}

By far the greatest use of camel trains occurs between [[North Africa|North]] and [[West Africa]] by the [[Tuareg]], [[Shuwa Arabic|Shuwa]] and [[Hassaniyya]], as well as by culturally-affiliated groups like the [[Toubou people|Toubou]], [[Hausa people|Hausa]] and [[Songhai people|Songhay]]. These camel trains conduct trade in and around the [[Sahara Desert]] and [[Sahel]]. Trains travel as far south as central [[Nigeria]] and northern [[Cameroon]] in the west, and northern [[Kenya]] in the east of the continent. In antiquity, the Arabian Peninsula was an important route for the trade with [[India]] and [[Ethiopia|Abyssinia]]. 

Camel trains have also long been used in portions of trans-Asian trade, including the [[Silk Road]]. As late as the early twentieth century, camel caravans played an important role connecting the [[Beijing]]/[[Shanxi]] region of eastern China with [[Mongolia]]n centers ([[Ulaanbaatar|Urga]], [[Uliastai]], [[Khovd (city)|Kobdo]]) and [[Xinjiang]]. The routes went across [[Inner Mongolia|Inner]] and/or [[Mongolia|Outer]] Mongolia. According to Owen Lattimore, who spent five months in 1926 crossing the northern edge of China (from [[Hohhot]] to [[Qitai County|Gucheng]], via Inner Mongolia) with a camel caravan, demand for caravan trade was only increased by the arrival of foreign steamships into Chinese ports and the construction of the first railways in eastern China, as they improved access to the world market for such products of western China as wool.&lt;ref name=drt&gt;Lattimore, Owen [1928/9] ''The Desert Road to Turkestan''. London, Methuen and Co; &amp; various later editions. Caravan logistics and organization is discussed in Chap. VIII, "Camel-Men All"; route maps are found inside the back cover.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/peoplesdaily/article-3070496/Tea-merchants-retrace-ancient-Silk-Road-year-long-journey-China-attempts-revive-glory-fabled-trading-route.html Daily Mail: "Tea merchants retrace Silk Road on camels" (2015)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Australia==
{{See also|Australian feral camel}}
In the English-speaking world the term "camel train" often applies to [[Australia]], notably the service that once connected a railhead at [[Oodnadatta, South Australia|Oodnadatta]] in [[South Australia]] to [[Alice Springs]] in the center of the continent. The service ended when the [[train]] line was extended to Alice Springs in 1929; that train is called "[[the Ghan]]", a shortened version of "Afghan Express", and its logo is camel and rider, in honor of the "Afghan cameleers" who pioneered the route.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greatsouthernrail.com.au/site/the_ghan/history.jsp|title=The Ghan; history|publisher=Great Southern Rail|accessdate=18 February 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120202122818/http://www.greatsouthernrail.com.au/site/the_ghan/history.jsp|archivedate=2 February 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==North America==
;United States
{{Main|US Camel Corps}}
The history of camel trains in the United States consists mainly of an experiment by the United States Army. On April 29, 1856, thirty-three camels and five drivers arrived at [[Indianola, Texas]]. While camels were suited to the job of transport in the American Southwest, the experiment failed. Their stubbornness and aggressiveness made them unpopular among soldiers, and they frightened horses. Many of the camels were sold to private owners, others escaped into the desert. These feral camels continued to be sighted through the early 20th century, with the last reported sighting in 1941 near [[Douglas, Texas]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/whatever-happened-wild-camels-american-west-180956176/?no-ist Smithsonian: "Whatever Happened to the Wild Camels of the West?"]&lt;/ref&gt;

;British Columbia, Canada
{{Main|Cariboo camels}}
Camels were used from 1862 to 1863 in [[British Columbia]], [[Canada]] during the [[Cariboo Gold Rush]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cariboogoldrush.com/wagonroa/camel1.htm Cabiroo.com: Camels]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Camel caravan organization==
While organization of camel caravans varied over time and the territory traversed, [[Owen Lattimore]]'s account of caravan life in northern China in the 1920s gives a good idea of what camel transport is like. In his ''Desert Road to Turkestan'' he describes mostly camel caravans run by [[Han Chinese]] and [[Hui people|Hui]] firms from eastern China ([[Hohhot]], [[Baotou]]) or [[Xinjiang]] ([[Qitai County|Qitai]] (then called Gucheng), [[Barkol Kazakh Autonomous County|Barkol]]), plying the routes connecting those two regions through the [[Gobi Desert]] by  way of [[Inner Mongolia|Inner]] (or, before Mongolia's independence, [[Mongolia|Outer]]) Mongolia. Before Outer Mongolia's effective independence of China (circa 1920) the same firms also ran caravans into [[Ulaanbaatar|Urga]], [[Uliassutai]], and other centers of Outer Mongolia, and to the Russian border at [[Kyakhta]], but with the creation of an international border, those routes came into decline. Less important caravan routes served various other areas of northern China, such as most centers in today's [[Gansu]], [[Ningxia]], and northern [[Qinghai]]. Some of the oldest [[Hohhot]]-based caravan firms had a history dating to the early [[Qing Dynasty]].&lt;ref name=drt/&gt;

===Camels===
[[File:Lugou-Bridge-east-end-relief-3577.jpg|250px|thumb|A modern sculptor's depiction of (the head of) a caravan approaching [[Beijing]], complete with a camel-puller and a mounted caravan master, head cook, or  ''xiansheng'' riding next to him. In the deserts of Mongolia, one would not see a dignitary in a [[sedan chair]] travelling along, nor would a baby camel accompany its mother.&lt;ref&gt;According to Lattimore (1928/9, p. 207), while pregnant female camels could travel as part of the caravan with a full load, any baby camel born in the desert would have to be abandoned, since, if the camel cow were to [[lactation|nurse]] the young one, she would become too thin for work.&lt;/ref&gt;]] Caravans originating from both ends of the Hohhot-Gucheng route were composed of two-humped [[Bactrian camels]], suitable for the climate on the area, although very occasionally one could see single-humped [[Dromedary|Dromedaries]] brought to this route by [[Uyghur people|Uighur]] ("Turki", in Lattimore's parlance) caravan people from [[Hami Prefecture|Hami]]&lt;ref&gt;Lattimore (1928/9), p. 151.&lt;/ref&gt; A caravan would be normally composed of a number of files ({{zh|c=连}}, ''lian''), of up to 18 camels each. Each of the rank-and-file caravan men, known as the ''camel-pullers'' ({{zh|c=拉骆驼的}}, ''la luotuo-de''), was in charge of one such file. On the march, the camel-puller's job was to lead the first camel of his file by a rope tied to a peg attached to its nose, each of the other camels of the file being led by means of similar rope by the camel in front of it. Two files (''lian'') formed a ''ba'', and the camel-pullers of the two files would help each other when loading cargo on the camels at the beginning of each day's march or unloading it when halted. To do their job properly camel-pullers had to be experts on camels: as Lattimore comments, "because there is no good doctoring known for him [a camel] when he is sick, they must learn how to keep him well." Taking care of camels' health included the ability to find the best available grazing for them and keeping them away from poisonous plants; knowledge of when one should not allow a camel to drink too much water; how to park camels for the night, allowing them to obtain the best possible shelter from wind-blown snow in winter; how to properly distribute the load to prevent it from hurting the animal; and how to treat minor injuries of the camels, such as blisters or pack-sores.&lt;ref&gt;Lattimore (1928/9), pp. 108-115&lt;/ref&gt;

The loading of camels was described by [[Mildred Cable]] and [[Francesca French]] in their book ''Through Jade Gate and Central Asia'' (1927): «In the loading of a camel its grumblings commence as the first bale is placed on its back, and continue uninterruptedly until the load is equal to its strength, but as soon as it shows signs of being in excess, the grumbling ceases suddenly, and then the driver says: "Enough! put no more on this beast!"»&lt;ref&gt;Cable, M. &amp; French, F. (1937) ''Through Jade Gate and Central Asia''; 6th ed. London: Hodder &amp; Stoughton; p. 21&lt;/ref&gt;

===Caravan people ===

A caravan could consist of 150 or so camels (8 or more files), with a camel-puller for each file. Besides the camel-pullers the caravan would also include a ''xiansheng'' (先生, literally, "Sir", "Mister") (typically, an older man with a long experience as a camel-puller, now playing the role of a general manager), one or two cooks, and the caravan master, whose authority over the caravan and its people was as absolute as that of a captain on a ship. If the owner of the caravan did not travel with the caravan himself, he would send along a [[supercargo]]--the person who will take care of the disposal of the freight upon arrival, but had no authority during the journey. The caravan could carry a number of paying passengers as well, who would alternate between riding on top of a camel load and walking.&lt;ref name=drt/&gt;

Camel-pullers' salary was quite low (around 2 silver [[tael]]s a  month in 1926, which would not be enough even for shoes and clothing he wore out while walking with his camels), although they were also fed and provided with tent space at the caravan owner's expense. Those people worked not so much for the wages as for the benefit of carrying some cargo—half of a camel load, or a full load—of their own on the caravan's camels; when successfully sold at the destination, it would bring a handy profit. Even more importantly, if a camel-puller could afford to buy a camel or a few of his own, he was allowed to include them into his file, and to collect the carriage-money for the cargo (assigned by the caravan owner) that they would carry. Once the camel-puller got rich enough to own close to a full file of 18 camels, he could join the caravan not as an employee but as a kind of a partner—now instead of earning wages he would be paying money (around 20 [[tael]]s per round-trip in 1926) to the owner of (the rest of) the caravan for the benefit of joining the caravan, sharing in the food, etc.&lt;ref name=drt/&gt;

===Diet===
The caravan people's food was mostly based around [[oat]] and [[millet]] flour, with some animal fat. A sheep would be bought from the Mongols and slaughtered every now and then, and tea was the usual daily drink; as fresh vegetables were scarce, [[scurvy]] was a danger.&lt;ref name=drt/&gt; Besides the paid cargo and the food and gear for the men, the camels would also carry a fair amount of [[fodder]] for themselves (typically, dried [[peas]] when going west, and [[barley]] when going east, those being the cheapest types of camel feed in Hohhot and Gucheng, respectively). It was estimated that, when leaving its point of origin, for every 100 loads of merchandise the caravan would carry around 30 loads of fodder. When that was not enough (especially in winter) more fodder could be bought (very expensively) from dealers who would come to the caravan route's popular stopping places from the populated areas of Gansu or Ningxia to the south.&lt;ref&gt;Lattimore (1928/9), p. 74&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cargo===
Typical cargo carried by the caravans were commodities such as wool, cotton fabrics, or tea, as well as miscellaneous manufactured goods for sale in Xinjiang and Mongolia. Opium was carried as well, typically by smaller, surreptitious, caravans, usually in winter (since in the hot weather opium would be too easily detected by the smell). More exotic loads could include [[jade]] from [[Khotan]],&lt;ref&gt;Lattimore (1928/9), pp. 156-157.&lt;/ref&gt; elk [[antlers]] prized in [[Chinese medicine]], or even dead bodies of the [[Shanxi]] caravan men and traders, who happened to die while in Xinjiang. In the latter case, the bodies had been first "temporarily" buried in Gucheng in light-weight coffins, and when, after three or so years in the grave the flesh had been mostly "[[mummy|consumed away]]", the merchant guild sent the bodies to the east by a special caravan. Due to the special nature of the load, higher freight rate was charged for such "dead passengers".&lt;ref&gt;Lattimore (1928/9), pp. 230-231&lt;/ref&gt;

===Speed===
According to Lattimore's diary, caravan travel in Inner Mongolia did not always follow a regular schedule. Caravans traveled or camped at any time of day or night, depending on weather, local conditions, and the  need for rest. Since the caravan traveled at the walking speed of the men, the distance made in a day (a "stage") was usually between {{convert|10|and|25|mi|km|0|abbr=on}}, depending on road and weather conditions, and distances between water sources. On occasions several days were spent in a camp without going forward, due to bad weather. A one-way trip from [[Hohhot]] to [[Qitai County|Gucheng]] ({{convert|1550|to|1650|mi|km|abbr=on|disp=or}} by Lattimore's reckoning&lt;ref&gt;Lattimore (1928/9), p. 100&lt;/ref&gt;) could take anything from three to eight months.&lt;ref name=drt50&gt;Lattimore (1928-29), pp. 50-51.&lt;/ref&gt;

Smaller caravans owned by Mongols of the [[Alxa League|Alashan]] (the westernmost Inner Mongolia) and manned by Han Chinese from [[Minqin County|Zhenfan]], were able to make longer marches (and, thus, cover longer distances faster) than the typical Han Chinese or Hui caravans, because the Mongols were able to always use "fresh" camels (picked from their large herd for just a single journey), every man was provided with a camel to ride, and loads were much lighter than in the "standard" caravans (rarely exceeding {{convert|270|lb|kg|1}}. These caravans would typically travel by day, from sunrise to sunset.&lt;ref&gt;Lattimore (1928/9), p. 168.&lt;/ref&gt; Such a camel train is described in the accounts of the journey made by [[Peter Fleming (writer)|Peter Fleming]] and [[Ella Maillart]] in the Gobi Desert in the mid-1930s.

===Logistics===
It was necessary for camels to spend at least two months between long journeys to recuperate, and the best time for that recuperation was in June–July, when camels shed their [[camel hair|hair]] and the grazing is best. Therefore, the best practice was for a caravan to leave [[Hohhot]] in August, just after the grazing season; upon reaching Gucheng, weaker camels could stay there until the next summer by grazing whatever vegetation is available in winter, while the stronger ones, after a few weeks of recovery on a grain diet (grain being cheaper in Xinjiang than in eastern China), would be sent back in late winter/early spring, taking along plenty of grain for fodder, and returning to Hohhot before the next grazing season. Vice versa, one could leave Hohhot in the spring, spend the summer grazing season in Xinjiang, and come back in the late fall of the same year. Either way, it would be possible for the caravan people and their best camels to make a full round trip within a year. However, such perfect scheduling was not always possible, and it was often the case that a caravan sent out from Hohhot in August would end up staying on the other end of the route until and through the next grazing season, coming back to Hohhot about a year and a half after its departure.
&lt;ref name=drt50/&gt;

===Loss of camels; camel hair trade===
On almost every journey quite a few camels in each caravan would be lost. On a particularly exhausting section of the trip, an animal already worn out by many weeks of walking, or accidentally poisoned by eating a poisonous plant, would kneel down and not rise anymore. Since killing a camel was considered bad [[karma]] by the caravan people, the hopeless animal—whose death, if it was owned by an individual camel-puller, would be a huge material loss for its owner—was simply left behind to die, "thrown on the Gobi" as the camel men would say.&lt;ref&gt;Lattimore (1928/9), p. 104.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since camels moult in the summer, camel owners received additional income from collecting several pounds of [[camel hair|hair]] their animals dropped during the summer grazing (and shedding season); in northern China, the camel hair trade started around the 1880s. Later, caravan men learned the art of [[knitting]] and [[crocheting]] from the defeated [[White movement|White Russians]] (in exile in Xinjiang after the [[Russian Civil War]]) and the items they had made were transported to eastern China by camel caravan. Although the hair shed by the camels or picked from them was of course considered the property of the camel owners, caravan workers were entitled to make use of some hair for making knitwear for themselves (mostly socks) or for sale. [[Owen Lattimore|Lattimore]] in 1926 observed camel-pullers "knitting on the march; if they ran out of [[yarn]], they would reach back to the first camel of the file they were leading, pluck a handful of hair from the neck, and roll it in their palms into the beginning of a length of yarn; a weight was attached to this, and given a twist to start it spinning, and the man went on feeding wool into the thread until he had spun enough yarn to continue his knitting".&lt;ref name=drt52&gt;Lattimore (1928/9), p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cultural associations==
"In The Desert" ("Верблюды", lit. = "camels") is a "traditional Russian" song, performed by [[Donald Swann]]. He provides an English-language translation after every line. The song is extremely repetitive ("Another camel is approaching"), rendering the translation largely redundant, "a whole caravan of camels is approaching".&lt;ref&gt;Flanders and Swann, "[http://www.allmusic.com/album/flanders-amp-swann-at-the-drop-of-another-hat-mw0001321681 At the Drop of Another Hat]" (1964)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Fritz Mühlenweg]] wrote a book called ''In geheimer Mission durch die Wüste Gobi'' (part one in English ''Big Tiger and Compass Mountain''), published in 1950. It was later shortened and translated into English under the title ''Big Tiger and Christian''; it concerns the adventures of two boys who cross the [[Gobi Desert]].

This brick tea, in the absence of metallic currency, forms the circulating medium in Mongolia, Siberia, and Thibet. When in the province of Peichihli I witnessed the departure of a train of 2,000 of these camels laden with brick tea to be sold in the Russian markets. These beasts are also employed in transporting coal, and other commodities, from one part of the province to another, and they are highly esteemed by the Mongols, as they can be easily managed, and can accomplish long journeys in arid regions with scant supplies of food and water. As many of my readers are aware, the camel is physically adapted for traversing the sandy plains of Asia, where they are found in the greatest numbers. The stomach is supplied with bladders which enable the animal to carry a store of fresh water, and in like manner the humps are furnished with a store of food in the shape of fatty matter which may be absorbed in case of need."&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The '''Canopus Foundation''' is a registered private charitable institution under German jurisdiction founded in 1997 by Wolfgang Heller and Dr. [[Peter W. Heller]].

== Organization ==

=== Management ===
Executive Director of the foundation is Dr. Peter W. Heller. Members of the Board of Trustees are Micaela Heller, Julia T. Heller and Dieter Heller.

=== Staff ===
The foundation employs 2 permanent staff and 4 freelancers (status: 2014). The yearly operating expenses are approximately 300.000 Euro.

=== Office ===
The foundation is legally registered in Dreieich, Germany. The office is located in [[Freiburg im Breisgau]], Germany.

== History ==
The initial focus after the establishment of the Canopus Foundation in October 1997 was set on the development of a specific entrepreneurial profile for the organization. Between 2000 and 2008 Canopus gained valuable practical experience while working with [[social entrepreneurs]] in [[Less developed countries|less developed]] and [[emerging countries]]. 
During this time, the foundation supported among others the project "The Sun Shines for All" of IDEAAS (Brazil) providing low-income families in Paranà and Rio Grande do Sul with [[solar power]]-generated [[electricity]]; assisted SELCO Ltd. in Bangalore, India,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ashden.org/winners/selco |title=SELCO, India Affordable solar power for homes and small businesses |publisher=Ashden |accessdate=2012-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; in certifying their solar systems as “[[Certified Emission Reduction]]” (CER) projects; advised the [[Barefoot College]] in Tilonia, India, on the establishment of a manual production line of [[Solar lamp|solar lanterns]], and cooperated with [[Grameen Bank]], [[Grameen Shakti]] and Grameen Cybernet in providing three village schools in Bangladesh with [[thin-film solar module]]s for the local power generation.

In 2008, in cooperation with [[Ashoka]], the Canopus Foundation launched the Solar for All Initiative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ashoka.org/press/8346 |title=Ashoka, Bamboo Finance, and the Canopus Foundation Join Forces to Launch Solar Energy Fund for Developing Countries |publisher=Ashoka |date=2011-05-31 |accessdate=2012-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The objective of the global initiative is to make [[solar energy]] affordable to 1.3 billion people without access to electricity. 
In 2010, the Indian company [[Greenlight Planet]] was awarded with the Solar for All Innovation Prize at [[Intersolar]] North America in San Francisco.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.renewableenergyfocus.com/view/10911/greenlight-planet-wins-solar-for-all-contest/ |title=Greenlight Planet wins Solar for All contest |publisher=Renewable Energy Focus |date=2010-07-13 |accessdate=2012-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.intersolar.us/en/news-north-america/intersolar-news/intersolar-news.html?tx_ttnews%5btt_news%5d=236&amp;cHash=cbedd9cc82c73f3bee88488a3b1304cc |title=Intersolar North America - Intersolar News |publisher=Intersolar.us  |date=2010-07-13 |accessdate=2012-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2010 the foundation initiated the development of an energy access [[Social impact assessment|Social Impact]] Investment Fund, the conceptual work was partly funded by the European Investment Bank. In 2011 the Canopus Foundation handed the concept over to [[Bamboo Finance]], Geneva, an investment management company specialised in micro credit and other social impact funds.
In 2014 the foundation started the project "re.Mini" in close collaboration with iiDevelopment, Frankfurt / Germany, to foster the implementation of renewable energy powered village grids in South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa.

== Mission ==
According to its Charter, the core activities of the foundation are poverty mitigation, the protection of climate and environment (international projects in Asia, Africa, South America), and the advancement of scientific research and education on sustainable development (projects in Europe and Germany).
Over the last 14 years the foundation has focused its project work on the promotion of private [[Social investing|social investment]] and [[social enterprise]] in order to fight [[poverty]] and [[environmental degradation]], and the provision of [[business development]] assistance for social entrepreneurs in developing countries working in the field of [[Clean energy technology|clean energy technologies]] and energy access.

== Approach ==
As a family foundation Canopus pursues the [[venture philanthropy]] model&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://canopusfund.org/fileadmin/DATEIEN/DATEIEN/Downloads/PDF/Venture_Philanthropy/Venture_Philanthropy_in_Theorie_and_Praxis.pdf |title="Venture Philanthropy in der Praxis - Die Canopus Foundation", in: Venture Philanthropy in Theorie und Praxis |publisher=Hoelscher/Ebermann/Schlüter, Maecenata Schriften Bd. 7, (Lucius &amp; Lucius), S. 13-22. |date=Stuttgart 2010 |accessdate=2012-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; which transfers the method and tools of [[venture capital]] to the social sector, responding to its growing demand for advanced financial engineering. The foundation promotes the long term allocation of philanthropic risk capital to early stage social enterprises, laying the ground for financial self-sufficiency and the expansion of their social and ecological impact. Towards this end the Canopus Foundation provides additional technical expertise, management skills and market intelligence where needed. Since 2008 the foundation is a member of the [[European Venture Philanthropy Association]] (EVPA).

Front and back boots have leather covers.&lt;br&gt;(Seeley Stable Museum,&lt;br&gt;[[Old Town San Diego State Historic Park|Old Town San Diego]], California)]]
[[File:"Good bye to Lake George." Glen's Falls Stage, by Stoddard, Seneca Ray, 1844-1917 , 1844-1917 (cropped).jpg|thumb|[[Glens Falls, New York|Glen's Falls]], [[Lake George, New York|Lake George]] &amp; [[Chester, Warren County, New York|Chester]] stagecoach. circa 1880]]
'''Concord stagecoaches''' are horse-drawn [[stagecoach]]es which employ a style of suspension and construction particularly suited to North America's early 19th century roads. Leather thoroughbraces suspend passengers who are in constant motion while the stagecoach is moving. The swaying is accepted by passengers for the shock absorbing action of the leather straps and for the way the special motion eases the stagecoach over very rough patches of roadway. The coaches were first developed and built by [[Abbot-Downing Company|coachbuilder J Stephen Abbott and wheelwright Lewis Downing]] of [[Concord, New Hampshire]]. The expense of the high quality of the vehicle's construction had to be set against its structure's good lasting qualities improved by the relative smoothness of its thoroughbrace suspension system. These features attracted passengers.

Abbott and Downing's Concord design replaced European designs which had short useful lives under punishing [[North America]]n conditions. They were exported to Australia and South Africa.

Railroads replaced stagecoaches in the middle of the 19th century, but Concord coaches remained in commercial use into the 20th century and continue to be used in parades and for publicity purposes by [[Wells Fargo|Wells Fargo Bank]].

==Dimensions==
The smallest six-passenger Concord weighed two and a quarter tons or 2.25 metric tonnes and stood six feet eight inches or two metres tall.&lt;ref name=MG&gt;Melody Groves, ‘’Butterfield’s Byway’’, The History Press, Charleston SC 29403, 2014 {{ISBN|9781625850379}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design features==
===Construction===
[[File:Coach-abbott-downing-concord-type-288914-large.jpg|thumb|The three perches, the front transom supporting the metal uprights, and the front axle with its link for the pole.&lt;br&gt;Brake levers on the outside edge either side]]
Timber: white oak, ash and basswood braced with iron bands.&lt;ref name=MG/&gt; Iron fittings. Leather and canvas.

===Undercarriage===
The undercarriage supports the leather thoroughbraces&lt;ref group=note&gt;Strong leather straps supporting the body of a coach or other vehicle; also "thorough braces"&lt;/ref&gt; carrying the body. The two axles are tied together by a firm undercarriage braced by three straight perches (lengthwise frame members) and given a relatively slim transom (the transverse members at either end of the perches).

Each end of each transom holds an upright metal standard from which hang the leather thoroughbraces.&lt;ref name=RS&gt;Robert Sallman. "Coaching in the New and Old World", ''The Carriage Journal'': Vol 16 No 4 Spring 1979. edited by Thomas Ryder. Carriage Association of America 1979&lt;/ref&gt;

===Brakes===
The back wheels have brake blocks acting on the iron tires. The driver controls them with a foot lever to his right at the side of his footboard.&lt;ref name=RS/&gt;

===Body===
The body needs to make no contribution to the rigidity of the undercarriage and so is more lightly constructed than was the custom for European vehicles. This lightness also eases progress on the very rough roads.&lt;ref name=RS/&gt;

There are three bench seats accommodating up to nine people though models to seat six and twelve passengers were available. The benches at the front and back of the body have limited headroom.&lt;ref name=RS/&gt; Passengers on the center bench are given no backrest but steady themselves with a broad leather harness suspended across the coach by straps from the roof.&lt;ref name=MG/&gt;

Another six passengers can travel in the open air on the body's roof. There is an external luggage compartment or boot at the back of the body and another boot for valuables below the driver's seat at the front.&lt;ref name=RS/&gt;

Windows are glazed, but in the 19th century the glass did not withstand hard overland mail trails of the western United States.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Horses==
The leading horses are known as the lead horses. The wheel horses or wheelers are the back pair nearest the coach's wheels.&lt;ref name=RS/&gt; The number of horses, usually four or six, could be even more. Two horses alone would very soon tire.

==Operation==
[[File:Stage Coach Between Charlestown, NH and Springfield, VT.jpg|thumb|The Springfield coach, 1907. [[Charlestown, New Hampshire|Charlestown, NH]] to [[Springfield, Vermont|Springfield, VT]]]]
It is not possible to guide a Concord coach with European-style precision. The Concord body continuously shifts. The driver or coachman has to sit slightly askew and brace himself with the aid of a steeply angled footboard. He cannot keep his reins in a steady contact with the horses' mouths. He has to bend his arms and elbows to constantly compensate, and his body always leans slightly forward. He holds his left reins in his left hand and his right reins — separated by his middle finger — in his right hand and not all in one hand like a European could. It is easy to slacken an individual rein but much more difficult to shorten it. His right hand also has to control his whip used on the wheel horses. If obliged to make his right hand free, then he must lay all the right hand reins in his left hand unseparated.&lt;ref name=RS/&gt;

The horses were harnessed very loosely by European standards because without proper roads the horses had to be allowed to avoid their particular obstacles. The Concord pole, though mounted to allow far more play, moved less.&lt;ref name=RS/&gt;

The result was the coach's direction was straighter than with a European coach, it did not respond to every irregularity in the road.&lt;ref name=RS/&gt;

Concord stagecoaches were expensive. Abbot-Downing also supplied a much simpler, lighter, and less expensive vehicle which they named ''Overland wagon'' and later ''Western passenger wagon''.&lt;ref name=KW&gt;Ken Wheeling, ''They Called Them Mudders.'' The Carriage Journal, Vol 43 No 5 October 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dam removal''' is the process of demolishing a [[dam]], leaving a river to flow freely. It is undertaken for a variety of reasons that include environmental rehabilitation, structural weakness and maintenance expense.

All dams negatively affect the aquatic environments of rivers that they are located on, but those effects are often negated by the stated purpose of the dam, whether it is hydroelectric power, flood control, or other functions. When the [[Environmental impact of reservoirs|negative environmental effects]] outweigh the benefits, a dam may be considered for removal. This happened on the [[Elwha River]] in [[Olympic National Park]] in Washington when extraordinarily rich salmon habitat was being disrupted by an out-dated hydroelectric plant. Before dams were built on the Elwha River, 400,000 salmon returned each year to spawn, but that number dropped to fewer than 3,000 after dams were put up.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blogs.ei.columbia.edu/2011/08/29/removing-dams-and-restoring-rivers/|title=Removing Dams and Restoring Rivers|access-date=2016-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once the hydroelectric power generating capacities of the dams had outlived their useful lives, the importance of this salmon habitat necessitated the removal of the dams on the Elwha River.

Dam failure is another threat that can lead to the removal of dams. Sometimes the fear of failure is due to seismic activity or the placement of the dam. Additionally, the older the dam is, the more likely it is to fail. Around the world, a growing number of 20th-century dam construction projects are reaching the end of their design lives: as of 1996, 5,000 large dams around the world were more than 50 years old.[1]  By 2020, in the United States alone, 85% percent of the country’s dams will have exceeded that 50 year threshold.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Finally, economic reasons often provide a convincing reason to remove a dam. The cost of keeping outdated hydroelectric equipment running decades after it was installed or upgrading dam safety systems may not be worth it. Additionally, population centers and industrial facilities that demanded hydropower decades ago can move and leave the dam without a purpose.

Since around 2000, most major dam removal projects, and the largest single project, the $350M removal of two [[Olympic Peninsula]] dams as part of the [[Elwha Ecosystem Restoration]], have been driven by restoration of river habitat and fish passages.  Inspired by the Elwha project, a French group called ''SOS Loire Vivante'' successfully lobbied for the removal of two dams in the Upper [[Loire Valley]], and the re-engineering of a 1941 hydroelectric dam on the [[Allier River]] to restore habitat for [[Atlantic salmon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Xin|first1=Guo|title=French Dam Removal Opens Way for Atlantic Salmon|url=https://www.internationalrivers.org/resources/french-dam-removal-opens-way-for-atlantic-salmon-1632|accessdate=9 April 2016|publisher=internationalrivers.org|date=5 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States roughly 900 dams were removed between 1990 and 2015, with another 50 to 60 more every year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Struck|first1=Doug|title=Setting rivers free: As dams are torn down, nature is quickly recovering|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/Environment/2014/0803/Setting-rivers-free-As-dams-are-torn-down-nature-is-quickly-recovering|accessdate=9 April 2016|publisher=Christian Science Monitor|date=3 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  France and Canada have also completed significant removal projects,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Zhao-Yin Wang, Joseph H.W.

==Purposes and effects of dams==
[[Image:Grand Coulee Dam.jpg|thumb|right|Grand Coulee Dam, Columbia River, Washington, United States]]

Many of the dams in the eastern United States were built for [[water diversion]], [[agriculture]], factory [[watermill]]s, and other purposes that are no longer seen as useful. Because of the age of these dams, over time the risk for catastrophic failure increases. In addition, many of these dams block [[Fish migration#Classification|anadromous]] fish runs, such as [[Atlantic salmon]] and [[American shad]], and prevent important sediments from reaching [[estuaries]].

Many dams in the western United States were built for agricultural [[water diversion]] in the arid country, with [[hydroelectric]] power generation being a very significant side benefit. Among the largest of these water diversion projects is the [[Columbia Basin Project]], which diverts water at the [[Grand Coulee Dam]]. The [[Bureau of Reclamation]] manages many of these water diversion projects.

Some dams in the [[Pacific Northwest]] and [[California]] block passage for anadromous fish species such as [[Pacific Salmon]] and [[Rainbow trout|steelhead]]. [[Fish ladder]]s and other passage facilities have been largely ineffective{{citation needed|date=October 2016}} in mitigating the negative effects on salmon populations. [[Bonneville Power Administration]] manages electricity on 11 dams on the [[Columbia River]] and 4 on the [[Snake River]], which were built by the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers|Army Corps of Engineers]].

[[Image:Grand Canyon Horse Shoe Bend MC.jpg|thumb|right|Clear water below Glen Canyon Dam, Arizona, United States]]

In the [[Desert Southwest]], dams can change the nature of the river ecosystem. In the particular case of the [[Glen Canyon Dam]], the originally warm, sediment-filled, muddy water, instead runs cold and clear through the [[Grand Canyon]], which has significant impacts on the downstream ecosystems. Three native fish species have become extinct in the Grand Canyon and others are endangered since the dam was completed, including [[humpback chub]] and [[razorback sucker]].

Some dam projects, such as those on the [[Salt River Project]] in [[Arizona]], eliminate the flow of the river downstream, by diverting the flow into the [[Arizona Canal]] system for use in agriculture and urban usage, such that only a dry channel or [[arroyo (creek)|arroyo]] heads out across the desert.

So much water is taken out of the [[Colorado River]] for agriculture, urban use, and evaporation behind the dams, that the river no longer flows into the [[Gulf of California]].

== Methods of removal ==
There are several ways dams can be removed and the chosen method will depend on many factors. The size and type of the dam, the amount of sediment behind the dam, the aquatic environment below the dam, who owns the dam and what their priorities are, and the timeframe of dam removal are all factors that affect how the dam will be removed.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hydroworld.com/articles/hr/print/volume-31/issue-07/articles/sediment-strategies-choosing-a-sediment-management-option-for-dam-removal.html|title=Sediment Strategies: Choosing a Sediment Management Option for Dam Removal|website=www.hydroworld.com|access-date=2016-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Removal is costly no matter what and expenses typically rise when greater weight is given to environmental concerns. Fortunately, the cost of dam removal is usually shared by multiple stakeholders such as the dam owner and either the federal, state or local government. Four of the most common dam removal methods are described below.

Sediment management is a driving force in all of them. A common problem for dams is how sediment carried naturally by the river is deposited in the reservoir and eventually fills it up with silt. This excess sediment reduces the hydroelectric generating capacity of a reservoir, changes the river channel downstream, traps nutrient-rich sediment behind the dam, and can put a dangerous amount of pressure on the dam itself. Oftentimes the sediment stored in a reservoir is good for the riparian corridor below the dam, can rebuild fish habitat, provide nutrients, and add onto a beach or estuary. Other times, the sediment can increase the turbidity of the river harming fish, scour the landscape, and bury infrastructure.
[[File:Notch and release approach at Glines Canyon Dam on Elwha River.jpg|thumb|288x288px|Here five notches can be seen at the Glines Canyon Dam as it was removed in a multi-year process.]]
Sediment can be tested before it is released to determine if it will be harmful to the landscape below the dam. Dam removal can have adverse consequences if this is not done. For example, when the Fort Edward Dam on the Hudson River was removed in the 1970s, [[Polychlorinated biphenyl|PCBs]] in the sediment were released, affecting human and wildlife health downstream.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Notch and release approach ===
The notch and release approach is commonly used because of its ecological benefits. It is a slow method in which the reservoir is drained through notches cut into the dam. New notches are cut in so the water drains out of the reservoir at a consistent flow. The sediment trapped behind the dam flows downstream in a fixed rate that allows the ecosystem to adjust to the changes.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This method can take months or even over a year but has proven success with restoring fish species to rivers. The [[Elwha Ecosystem Restoration|Elwha and Glines Canyon dam removal project]] used the notch and release approach to great success.

=== Rapid release approach ===
The rapid release approach is both the quickest and least expensive way to remove a dam, but comes with significant drawbacks. In this approach, a large tunnel is dug through the base of the dam and then connected to the reservoir. The entire body of water will drain through this tunnel in a matter of minutes or hours and the massive release of water and sediment can cause severe flooding and erosion along the river downstream for miles. This can devastate the riparian ecosystem along the river as well as dangerously scour bridge pilings, buried pipes, levees, and other infrastructure. However, if the reservoir held back by the dam is relatively small and quickly drains into a larger river or lake, this approach can be carried out with minimal impact on either the ecosystem or human infrastructure.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Dig and dewater approach ===
The dig and dewater approach is typically the most expensive dam removal method, but is necessary in some cases. It entails emptying the entire reservoir, allowing the sediment to dry, and then transporting it to a safe location for disposal. It is costly and slow, but if the reservoir is located very near hydroelectric generating facilities that would be greatly impacted by released sediments, it may be necessary. Another situation is if the sediments behind the dam contain toxins. Hauling them away and disposing of them safely is important for the ecological health of the river.

=== Retained sediment approach ===
The retained sediment approach is the final commonly used approach and involves leaving the sediment behind where it is. To do this, the river or creek must be rerouted around the damsite which can prove expensive and challenging. This may be carried out in places where the dig and dewater approach makes sense, but are too remote to be cost-effective.

== Alternatives to removal ==
[[File:John Day Dam fish ladder.jpg|left|thumb|340x340px|Fish ladder at John Day Dam on the Columbia River.]]

While fewer than 1% of United States dams are being considered for removal, there has been a push in recent years to address the deficiencies in existing dams without removing them.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; These goals include maximizing the efficiency of existing dams and minimizing their environmental impact. Updating equipment and acknowledging that dams have a limited life span are two ways to achieve those goals. As part of them, a plan for decommissioning the dam and restoring the river should be drawn up long before the dam exceeds its design life. One part of river restoration that does not have to wait until the dam is removed is introducing [[environmental flow]]. Having variable amounts of water flow through the dam at different seasons mimics natural seasonal variations in water level from winter and spring storms. Additionally, [[fish ladder]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;[[Fish ladder|s]] can be added to dams to increase the connectivity of a river and allow fish to reach their spawning grounds. There’s debate about the effectiveness of fish ladders, but generally some fish will make it through as opposed to zero fish spawning in their traditional location.

== Completed projects ==

[[File:Condit Dam.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Condit Dam, Washington, United States]]

* 1973 - Lewiston Dam, [[South Fork Clearwater River]], [[Idaho]] – The {{convert|39|ft|m|abbr=on}} dam was built in 1927 as a hydroelectric facility, but lacked [[fish ladders]]. Upon completion of the [[Lower Granite Dam]] and its reservoir, the lack of gradient on the river made it obsolete. Its removal improved salmon runs on the river.
* 1997 - Marie Dorian Dam, [[Walla Walla River]], Oregon – The {{convert|8|ft|m|abbr=on}} dam blocked passage to [[Pacific Salmon]] and [[Rainbow trout|steelhead]] into the [[Blue Mountains (Oregon)|Blue Mountains]] from the [[Columbia River Drainage Basin|Columbia Basin]].
* 1999 - [[Edwards Dam]], [[Kennebec River]], [[Maine]] – Built in 1837, the {{convert|24|ft|m|abbr=on}} dam blocked access to [[Atlantic Salmon]] and [[American Shad]].  This was a landmark case in which a U.S. federal agency, the [[Federal Energy Regulatory Commission]], required the decommissioning and removal of a dam against the operator's wishes.
* 2004 - Embrey Dam, [[Rappahannock River]], [[Virginia]] - The 22-foot-tall, 770-foot-long, 1910 hydroelectric Embrey Dam was blown up with 600&amp;nbsp;lbs of explosives by the [[U.S. Army Dive team out of Ft. Eustis, VA]] on February 23, 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americanrivers.org/our-work/restoring-rivers/dams/projects/embrey-dam.html|title=Dams and Hydropower|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The aim of removal was to re-open miles of spawning grounds to aid populations of [[American Shad]], herring, catadromous American eel, and other species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fredericksburg.com/News/FLS/2006/022006/02232006/170364|title=Embrey Dam just a memory|work=Fredericksburg.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The historical character of the [[Nils F.

* 2004 - [[Cuddebackville Dam]], [[Neversink River]], [[New York (state)|New York]] - Built in two portions dating from the 1820s (for water diversion into a canal) and 1915 (for hydroelectric power), the dam had been abandoned since 1945.  The dam was removed in October 2004 by the [[U.S. Army Corps of Engineers]], in a novel partnership with the [[Nature Conservancy]], to benefit the aquatic life in the area, specifically the [[Dwarf Wedge Mussel]] and the [[American Shad]].
* 2007 - [[Marmot Dam]], [[Sandy River (Oregon)|Sandy River]], Oregon – The removal of this {{convert|50|ft|m|abbr=on}} dam by [[Portland General Electric]] has been extremely successful at improving access for [[Pacific Salmon]] and [[Rainbow trout|steelhead]] to the upper Sandy River watershed up into the [[Mount Hood Wilderness]].
* 2008 - [[Milltown Dam]], [[Clark Fork River, Blackfoot River (Montana)|Missoula]], Montana - Dam held startling levels of toxic sediments from 100 years of mining and logging. Removal improved water quality, trout habitat, and the general ecological condition of the watershed.
* 2009 - [[Savage Rapids Dam]], [[Rogue River (Oregon)|Rogue River]], [[Oregon]] – Built for agricultural [[water diversion]], it was removed by the [[Bureau of Reclamation]] due to its out-dated facilities and non-functioning fish ladders that prevented fish migration past the dam.
* 2011 - [[Condit Dam]], [[White Salmon River]], Washington – The {{convert|123|ft|m|abbr=on}} dam blocked access for [[Pacific Salmon]] and [[Rainbow trout|steelhead]] runs on {{convert|33|mi|km}} of river. [[PacifiCorp]] proposed to remove the dam, rather than paying for fish passage upgrades. Removal was proposed in 2006, but actions from [[Skamania County, Washington|Skamania]] and [[Klickitat County, Washington|Klickitat]] counties held up the process. In fall 2008, salmon were trucked up above to dam to allow them to spawn higher up the river. In October 2011, PacifiCorp contractors used explosives to blow a {{convert|15|ft|m|adj=on}} hole in the dam to drain its reservoir and allow young salmon to enter the [[Columbia River]] and head to sea.
* 2012 - [[Elwha Dam|Elwha]] and [[Glines Canyon Dam]]s, [[Elwha River]], [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]] – The largest dam removal project in history is the [[Elwha Ecosystem Restoration]] project on the [[Olympic Peninsula]] of [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]]. Starting in 2012, and finishing in 2014, the {{convert|108|ft|m|abbr=on}} [[Elwha Dam]] and the {{convert|210|ft|m|abbr=on}} [[Glines Canyon Dam]] were removed to restore stocks of [[Pacific Salmon]] and trout species to the [[Elwha River]] watershed. The removal of these blockades allows migratory salmon to travel past the dam sites and upriver, an event that has not occurred since the dams' creation in 1913. After spawning there, the salmon die and their carcasses decompose, releasing marine nutrients laid down in their bodies as they fed in the open ocean. This reintroduction provides a valuable research opportunity for interested parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.elwhascienceed.org/project-update/elwha-salmon-populations |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-11-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090107035629/http://www.elwhascienceed.org/project-update/elwha-salmon-populations |archivedate=2009-01-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the dam removal, reservoir beds that looked like moonscapes have returned to vibrant rich habitat.

==Proposed removals==

===Lower Snake River Dams, Washington, US===

[[File:LGLandDam.jpg|thumb|right|[[Little Goose Dam]], Washington, USA]]

Four dams along the lower [[Snake River]], built and still operated by the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers]], serve as hydroelectric power sources as well as maintaining an inland port at [[Lewiston, Idaho]] for agricultural barge traffic.  The four are candidates for removal because of millions of cubic yards accumulated behind the dams, which are raising water levels for riverside cities.  They include:  the 1975 {{convert|100|ft|m|abbr=on}} [[Lower Granite Dam]], the 1970 {{convert|98|ft|m|abbr=on}} [[Little Goose Dam]], the 1969 {{convert|100|ft|m|abbr=on}} [[Lower Monumental Dam]], and the 1962 {{convert|100|ft|m|abbr=on}} [[Ice Harbor Dam]].

Three million new cubic yards of sediment are deposited behind the lower four dams on the Snake River annually.&lt;ref&gt;Barker, E. (2007, February 16). Corps of engineers gets earful about sediment problems. Lewiston Tribune.&lt;/ref&gt;  The city of Lewiston, Idaho and others along the Snake have built a system of levees maintained by the Army Corps of Engineers. The levees in Lewiston were designed to leave five feet between water levels and the top of the levees.  As of 2011, two feet remained.  As water levels continue to rise, either some of the dams must be removed or dredged, or the municipal levees will continue to be raised.  The Corps admits that the amount of sediment in the riverbed is too great for dredging to be effective, and Lewiston community leaders are worried that higher levees will further cut the town off from its rivers.&lt;ref&gt;"Why Restore Wild Salmon?"

===Rindge Dam and Matilija Dam, Southern California===

[[File:Rindge Dam.jpg|right|thumb|[[Rindge Dam]] near [[Malibu, California]], built in 1924, completely silted and abandoned by the 1950s]]

The {{convert|100|ft|m|adj=on|abbr=on}} privately owned [[Rindge Dam]] on [[Malibu Creek]] in the [[Santa Monica Mountains]] of California was built in 1924 and has been allowed to completely fill with sediment, making it functionally obsolete but still a potential hazard.  Malibu Creek once supported the southernmost [[Rainbow trout|steelhead]] population in the world. But today, steelhead no longer occupy the creek.

The similar 1947 [[Matilija Dam]] near [[Ojai, California]] was built against the advice of the [[U.S. Army Corps of Engineers]], among others, and also blocked steelhead trout spawning grounds.  After being notched twice and largely silted up, 90% of its design capacity has been lost.  As of 2013 stakeholders agree that the dam and its sediment be removed, but no funding source has been identified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Carlson|first1=Cheri|title=Delayed plan to remove Matilija Dam near Ojai will get new studies|url=http://www.vcstar.com/news/delayed-plan-to-remove-matilija-dam-near-ojai-will-get-new-studies-ep-293034957-351781061.html|accessdate=11 April 2016|publisher=Ventura County Star|date=3 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Klamath River Dams, California / Oregon border===

{{main|Klamath River Hydroelectric Project}}

[[File:Klamath tribes dam removal demo.jpg|thumb|left|Demonstrators calling for removal of dams on the [[Klamath River]] in Oregon and California, USA]]

As resolution of several long-range issues centered on water rights in the [[Klamath Basin]], the multi-party [[Klamath Basin Restoration Agreement]] was signed in early 2008.  Parties to the agreement included the state of [[California]], the state of [[Oregon]], three Native American tribes, four counties, and 35 other local organizations and individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Klamath Basin Restoration Agreement|url=http://klamathrestoration.gov/sites/klamathrestoration.gov/files/Klamath-Agreements/Klamath-Basin-Restoration-Agreement-2-18-10signed.pdf|website=Klamath Restoration|accessdate=8 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This agreement called for the removal of four of the [[Klamath River Hydroelectric Project]] dams: the 1958 [[John C. Boyle Dam]], the 1922 [[Copco Number 1 Dam|Copco Number 1]] and Copco Number 2, and the 1964 [[Iron Gate Dam (California)|Iron Gate Dam]].  All four are privately owned by [[PacifiCorp]].  At the time PacifiCorp faced a relicensing cycle with [[Federal Energy Regulatory Commission]], with potentially expensive fixes for salmon passage and to address the growth of the toxic bacteria ''[[Microcystis aeruginosa]]'' in the Copco and Iron Gate Reservoirs.

On September 29, 2009, Pacificorp reached an agreement in principle with the other KBRA parties to remove the four dams, pending Congressional approval.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last=Fimrite | first=P. | url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2009/09/30/MNMM19UDKH.DTL&amp;tsp=1 | title=Deal to raze 4 Klamath dams | work=San Francisco Chronicle | date= 30 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Congress did not act, so as of February 2016, the states of Oregon and California, the dam owners, federal regulators and other parties reached a further agreement to remove all four Klamath basin dams by the year 2020, contingent only on approval by the [[Federal Energy Regulatory Commission]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sfgate.com/nation/article/New-plan-to-remove-Klamath-River-dams-without-6801869.php|title=New plan to remove Klamath River dams without help from Congress|first=Carolyn |last=Lochhead|date=3 February 2016|work=SFGate}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new plan has been endorsed by the governors of California and Oregon, as well as the U.S. Secretary of the Interior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/science/ci_29738226/klamath-river-dam-removal-deal-signed-by-top|title=Klamath River dam removal deal signed by top federal, state officials|first=Will | last=Houston |date=7 April 2016|publisher=Eureka Times-Standard}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Glen Canyon Dam, northern Arizona ===

[[Image:Glencanyondam.jpg|thumb|right|Glen Canyon Dam]]

The {{convert|710|ft|m|abbr=on}} [[Glen Canyon Dam]] has been proposed for removal because of the negative effects it has on the water quality and riparian habitat of the [[Colorado River]] in [[Grand Canyon National Park]]. In addition, the reservoir impounded behind it, [[Lake Powell]] has filled all of the canyons for up to {{convert|160|mi|km}} above the dam. This lake, while providing recreational opportunities, has eliminated more than {{convert|160|mi|km}} of habitat for endangered [[Colorado River]] fish species.

The reservoir also loses more than 6 percent of the total annual flow of the Colorado River to evaporation and seepage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Why Glen Canyon?|url=http://www.glencanyon.org/glen_canyon/why-glen-canyon|work=Glen Canyon Institute|accessdate=15 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Advocates of dam removal such as the [[Glen Canyon Institute]] also cite these losses of stored water as reason to decommission the dam.   If it were to be removed, it would dwarf any completed dam removal project in history.

This ORW designation indicates the Kinni provides outstanding recreational opportunities, supports valuable fisheries and wildlife habitat, has good water quality, and is not significantly impacted by human activities.&lt;ref name="dnr.wi.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dnr.wi.gov/topic/surfacewater/orwerw.html|title=Use Designations - Wisconsin DNR|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This designation indicates that the State of Wisconsin has determined the Kinnickinnic River warrants additional protection from the effects of pollution. These designations are intended to meet federal Clean Water Act obligations requiring Wisconsin to adopt an “antidegradation” policy that is designed to prevent any lowering of water quality – especially in those waters having significant ecological or cultural value.&lt;ref name="dnr.wi.gov"/&gt;

The '''DeLorean time machine''' is a fictional automobile-based [[time travel]] device featured in the [[Back to the Future (franchise)|''Back to the Future'' franchise]]. In the feature film series, [[Emmett Brown|Dr. Emmett Brown]] builds a time machine based on a [[DeLorean DMC-12]] car, to gain insights into history and the future. Instead, he ends up using it to travel over 30 years of [[Hill Valley (Back to the Future)|Hill Valley]] history (from 1985 to 2015) with [[Marty McFly]] to change the past for the better and to undo the negative effects of time travel. One of the cars used in filming is on display at [[Universal Studios Hollywood]] and the official ''[[Back to the Future]]'' DeLorean can be viewed at the [[Petersen Automotive Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://petersen.org/backtothefuture/ |title=Petersen Automotive Museum |publisher= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160320133259/http://petersen.org/backtothefuture/ |archivedate=March 20, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operation==
The control of the time machine is the same in all three films. The operator is seated inside the DeLorean (except the first time, when a remote control is used), and turns on the time circuits, activating a unit containing multiple [[Fourteen-segment display|fourteen-]] and [[seven-segment display]]s that show the destination (red), present (green), and last-departed (yellow) dates and times. After entering a target date, the operator accelerates the car to {{convert|88|mph|km/h|1}}, which activates the flux capacitor. As it accelerates, several coils around the body glow blue/white while a burst of light appears in front of it. Surrounded by electrical current similar to a [[Tesla coil]], the whole car vanishes in a flash of white/blue light seconds later, leaving a pair of fiery tire tracks. A digital speedometer is attached to the dashboard so that the operator can accurately gauge the car's speed. Various proposals have been brought forth in the past by fans of the movie franchise for why the car has to be moving at 88&amp;nbsp;mph to achieve temporal displacement,&lt;ref name="13 things"&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/film/back-to-the-future/facts-trivia-anniversary/ ''Back to the Future: 13 things you may not know''], The Telegraph, October 21, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; but actually the production crew chose the velocity simply because they liked how it looked on the speedometer.&lt;ref name="13 things" /&gt;

Observers outside the vehicle see an implosion of [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] as the vehicle disappears, while occupants within the vehicle see a quick flash of light and instantaneously arrive at the target time in the same spatial location (relative to the Earth) as when it departed. In the destination time, immediately before the car's arrival, three large and loud flashes occur at the point from which the car emerges from its time travel. After the trip, the exterior of the DeLorean is [[endothermic|extremely cold]], and frost forms from atmospheric moisture all over the car's body.&lt;ref name="bttf1"&gt;{{cite video|date=1985|title=Back to the Future|medium=DVD}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A few technical glitches with the DeLorean hinder time travel for its users. In the first film, the car has starter problems and has a hard time restarting once stopped, much to Marty's repeated frustration.&lt;ref name="bttf1" /&gt; In the second movie, the destination time display malfunctions and shows random dates (mostly January 1, 1885), which partially cause Doc to be sent to 1885.&lt;ref name="bttf2"&gt;{{cite video|date=1989|title=Back to the Future Part II}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the third movie, the flying circuits (added by Doc in 2015), fuel line, and fuel injection manifold are damaged, preventing the car from moving under its own power.&lt;ref name="bttf3"&gt;{{cite video|date=1990|title=Back to the Future Part III}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fuel==
[[File:TeamTimeCar.com-BTTF DeLorean Time Machine-OtoGodfrey.com-JMortonPhoto.com-01.jpg|thumb|A back view of the DeLorean time machine]]

The time machine is electric and requires a power input of 1.21 [[Watt|gigawatts]] &lt;!-- The official spelling is "jigowatts". See below.--&gt;to operate, originally provided by a [[plutonium]]-fueled nuclear reactor.&lt;ref name="bttf1" /&gt; In the first movie, Doc has no access to plutonium in 1955, so he outfits the car with a large pole and hook in order to channel the power of a lightning bolt into the flux capacitor and send [[Marty McFly|Marty]] back to 1985.&lt;ref name="bttf1" /&gt; During Doc's first visit to 2015, he has the machine refitted to hover above ground in addition to standard road driving, and he replaces the nuclear reactor with a ''Mr. Fusion'' generator that uses garbage as fuel.&lt;ref name="bttf1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="bttf2" /&gt;

Although the Mr. Fusion unit provides the required power for the time machine, the DeLorean is still powered by an internal combustion engine for propulsion. The fuel line is damaged during Marty's trip to 1885 in ''[[Back to the Future Part III]]''; after he and Doc patch it, they attempt to use whiskey as a replacement fuel since commercial gasoline is not yet available. The test fails, damaging the car's [[fuel injection|fuel injection manifold]] and leaving it unable to travel under its own power.

Doc and Marty consider options to reach the required 88&amp;nbsp;mph (such as pulling it with horses, which fails because the car barely breaks 20 mph) but ultimately settle on pushing the car with a steam locomotive. For the extra power needed to push the DeLorean up to speed, Doc adds his own version of "Presto Logs" (a chemically treated mixture of pressed wood and [[anthracite]]) to the locomotive's boiler and chooses a location with a straight section of track long enough to achieve 88&amp;nbsp;mph.&lt;ref name="bttf3" /&gt;

The power required is pronounced in the film as one point twenty-one "''jigowatts''".&lt;ref name="bttf1" /&gt; While the closed-captioning in home video versions spells the word as it appears in the script, jigowatt,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imsdb.com/scripts/Back-to-the-Future.pdf |title=Back to The Future Script |format=PDF |accessdate=2010-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; the actual spelling matches the standard prefix and the term for power of "one billion watts": ''giga''watt. Although rarely used, the "j" sound at the beginning of the [[SI prefix]] "giga-" is an acceptable pronunciation for "[[Watt#Multiples|gigawatt]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/gigawatt |title=definition and pronunciation of gigawatt |publisher=Merriam-Webster Feb 2008 |date=April 25, 2007 |accessdate=2010-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lamar.colostate.edu/~hillger/si-prefixes.html |title=A Practical Guide to the International System of Units, U.S. Metric Association, Feb 2008 |publisher=Lamar.colostate.edu |date=April 5, 2006 |accessdate=2010-03-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100613185719/http://lamar.colostate.edu/~hillger/si-prefixes.html |archivedate=June 13, 2010 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the DVD commentary for ''Back to the Future,'' Bob Gale states that he had thought it was pronounced this way because it was how a scientific adviser for the film pronounced it.&lt;ref&gt;Chang, Richard S. [http://wheels.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/04/08/you-say-gigawatt-i-say-jigowatt/ "You Say Gigawatt, I Say Jigowatt."] The New York Times blog, April 8, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Equipment==
===Flux capacitor===
[[File:TeamTimeCar.com-BTTF DeLorean Time Machine-OtoGodfrey.com-JMortonPhoto.com-flux capacitor.jpg|thumb|A replica of the DeLorean time machine's flux capacitor]]
The ''flux capacitor'', which consists of a rectangular-shaped compartment with three flashing [[Geissler tube|Geissler-style tubes]] arranged in a "Y" configuration, is described by Doc as "what makes time travel possible." The device is the core component of the time machine.&lt;ref name="bttf1" /&gt;

As the time machine nears 88&amp;nbsp;mph, light coming from the flux capacitor begins pulsing more rapidly until it becomes a steady stream. Doc originally conceived the idea for the flux capacitor on [[Special:Permalink/418001305#Production notes|November 5]], 1955, when he slipped while hanging a clock in his bathroom and hit his head on the sink.&lt;ref name="bttf1" /&gt; A similar, but more primitive, steam-powered flux capacitor is also seen in the chimney headlamp of Doc's second time machine, the Time Train, at the end of ''[[Back to the Future Part III]].''&lt;ref name="bttf3" /&gt;

Although the films do not describe exactly how the flux capacitor works, Doc mentions at one point that the [[stainless steel]] body of the DeLorean has a direct and influential effect on the "flux dispersal", but he is interrupted before he can finish the explanation.&lt;ref name="bttf1" /&gt; The flux capacitor requires 1.21 gigawatts of [[electric power|electrical power]] to operate, which is roughly equivalent to the power produced by 15 typical commercial airplane jet engines.

The instruction manual for the [[Aluminum Metal Toys|AMT/ERTL]] DeLorean model kit says: "Because the car's stainless steel body improves the flux dispersal generated by the flux capacitor, and this in turn allows the vehicle smooth passage through the [[Spacetime|space time continuum]]."

===Mr. Fusion===
[[File:TeamTimeCar.com-BTTF DeLorean Time Machine-OtoGodfrey.com-JMortonPhoto.com-03.jpg|thumb|A replica of the DeLorean time machine's Mr. Fusion Home Energy Reactor]]
The Mr. Fusion Home Energy Reactor is the name of a power source used by the [[DeLorean DMC-12|DeLorean]] time machine in the [[Back to the Future (franchise)|''Back to the Future'' trilogy]]. It can be seen for the first time at the end of ''[[Back to the Future]]'' when "Doc" Emmett Brown pulls into the McFly's driveway after a trip to the year 2015. It is a parody of [[Mr. Coffee]] machines, which were very popular at the time of filming.&lt;ref&gt;Andersen, Kent. ''Saving Planet Earth: A Practical Hands-On Approach'', 2008, p. 101.&lt;/ref&gt; The appliance from which the prop was made was actually a [[Krups]] "Coffina" model coffee grinder.

The Mr. Fusion Home Energy Reactor converts household waste to power for the time machine's flux capacitor and time circuits using [[fusion power|nuclear fusion]], presumably [[cold fusion]]. In the film, Mr. Fusion allows the DeLorean time machine to generate the required 1.21 gigawatts needed to travel to any point in time. The energy produced by Mr. Fusion replaces plutonium as the primary power source of the DeLorean's time travel, allowing the characters to bypass the arduous power-generation requirements upon which the plot of the first film hinges. The plutonium fission reactor was most likely left installed underneath Mr. Fusion as a backup power source.&lt;ref name="bttf1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="bttf2" /&gt;

The Mr. Fusion can provide enough power to the flux capacitor but is not used to power up the DeLorean itself, which makes use of an ordinary gasoline combustion engine to reach the 88&amp;nbsp;mph speed necessary for it to time travel, a limitation that proved itself crucial in the third movie when Doc and Marty find themselves stuck in 1885 and unable to return with the DeLorean out of gas (due to a fuel leak). The vehicle's hover system is powered by Mr. Fusion and is capable of bringing the DeLorean up to the required 88&amp;nbsp;mph; the combustion engine was also probably left on board as a backup. However, the flight systems were destroyed as a result of a lightning strike, leaving Marty to rely on the original combustion engine, which in turn was disabled.

==Fictional timeline==
For most of the first film, the 1.21 [[Watt#Gigawatt|gigawatts]] are supplied by a plutonium-powered [[nuclear reactor|nuclear fission reactor]] and, with the absence of plutonium, a bolt of [[lightning]] channeled directly into the flux capacitor by a long pole and hook in the film's climactic sequence.&lt;ref name="bttf1" /&gt; At the end of the first film, and for the remainder of the trilogy, the plutonium nuclear reactor is replaced by a "[[fusion power|Mr. Fusion Home Energy Reactor]]" [[Electrical generator|generator]] possibly acquired in 2015.&lt;ref name="bttf2" /&gt; The "Mr. Fusion" device apparently converts household waste into electrical power; the name suggests [[nuclear fusion]]. Due to a "hover conversion" made in 2015, the car also becomes [[Flying car (fiction)|capable of hovering and flight]], though it lost this ability at the end of the second film.&lt;ref name="bttf2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="bttf3" /&gt;

The DeLorean returns to 1985 and proceeds to travel to October 21, 2015, to stop Marty's future son from committing a crime. While there, the DeLorean is stolen by Biff who then travels back to November 12, 1955, the same day as the climax of the first film, to give his past self a sports almanac to be used for gambling. Once Biff returns to 2015 without Doc's knowledge, the duo return to 1985, but find themselves in an alternate timeline where Hill Valley is ruled by Biff that Doc described as 1985A (alternate 1985). The DeLorean then travels back to 1955 to restore the timeline,&lt;ref name="bttf2" /&gt; but in the aftermath, it is struck by lightning again in the very same electrical storm, this time by accident. According to writers Bob Gale and Robert Zemeckis, the lightning causes the DeLorean to spin at 88 miles per hour,&lt;ref&gt;From the [http://bttf.wikidot.com/official-bttf-faq Official Back to the Future FAQ] by Bob Gale and Robert Zemeckis, question 1.16.&lt;/ref&gt; and Doc later states in a letter to Marty that the bolt caused a "gigawatt overload" which "shorted out the time circuits and destroyed the flying circuits".&lt;ref name="bttf3" /&gt; The DeLorean then disappears from 1955, travelling back in time to January 1, 1885 (earlier in the film, Doc mentions that the time circuits are not functioning correctly; several instances in the film that show the time circuit display showed 1885 as the destination when the time circuits malfunctioned).&lt;ref name="bttf2" /&gt;

Once in 1885, the DeLorean is hidden in a mine because suitable replacement parts to replace its destroyed microchip will not be invented until 1947 (presumably referring to the [[transistor]], invented in that year). Doc and Marty recover the DeLorean from the mine in 1955, and Doc builds a [[vacuum tube]] circuit assembly to replace the destroyed microchip circuitry and restore the vehicle's time travel capabilities. The tires have disintegrated in storage, so Doc replaces them with [[whitewall tire|whitewalls]]. The gasoline engine is still functional, but the flying circuits are not.

In a letter Doc wrote to Marty in 1885, Doc states he is happy in his new life there and requests that Marty not attempt to retrieve him, but instead to return to 1985 and destroy the DeLorean, believing that it has brought them and the world nothing but disaster. However, Marty and the Doc of 1955 learn of tragedy to come Doc's way when he is murdered by Biff's grandfather, Buford "Mad Dog" Tannen, on September 7, 1885; therefore, 1955 Doc agrees to send Marty back to the Old West to rescue himself.

When Marty arrives in 1885, the DeLorean's fuel line is pierced by an arrow during an Indian attack. He and Doc patch it and attempt to use whiskey as a replacement fuel, since commercial gasoline is not yet available; the test fails, destroying the fuel injection and ignition systems and leaving the car unable to travel under its own power. Its final trip, from 1885 to 1985, is propelled by a [[steam locomotive]] that has Doc's version of "Presto Logs" (pressed wood treated with [[anthracite]]) added to the boiler to provide the extra power needed to push the car up to 88&amp;nbsp;mph; once this speed is reached, the Mr. Fusion unit provides the power required to activate the flux capacitor and make the jump through time.&lt;ref name="bttf3" /&gt; Doc replaces the 1955-style wheels with cast iron train wheels that fit on the track rails. He uses the old tires and a wooden support to cushion the locomotive's "cow catcher" and the car's rear end. Since each of the three "Presto Logs" fire at different intervals with increasing power, Doc installs a boiler temperature gauge on the DeLorean's dashboard to indicate when the car will experience a sudden burst of acceleration.

Once the DeLorean makes its final trip from 1885, it arrives back in 1985 and is immediately destroyed by an oncoming freight train running in the opposite direction. Marty is able to bail out of the car seconds before the train strikes. Later the Time Train, which is Doc's second time machine, appeared in the same spot where the DeLorean was destroyed.

===Other elements===
[[File:TeamTimeCar.com-BTTF DeLorean Time Machine-OtoGodfrey.com-JMortonPhoto.com-04.jpg|thumb|The time circuits in a replica time machine]]
In the films, the DeLorean time machine is a licensed, registered vehicle in the state of California, where the films take place. The [[vanity plate|vanity license plate]] used in the film reads "OUTATIME", a deliberate anomaly, as the maximum number of symbols on California plates is seven characters.&lt;ref name="bttf1" /&gt; When Doc returns from 2015, it is a barcode license plate,&lt;ref name="bttf1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="bttf2" /&gt; which implies that by that year license plates have moved to other more sophisticated means of tracking and registering.

&lt;!--The information here about the train is irrelevant to this article; this article is about the DeLorean time machine, not about the entire series.--&gt;
In ''[[Back to the Future: The Animated Series|The Animated Series]]'', Doc builds another DeLorean into a time machine, restoring most of its features, including Mr. Fusion and the hover conversion (Doc either rebuilds the one destroyed at the end of ''Part III'' or he simply builds a new one). He also seemingly adds the capability to travel through space in addition to time (i.e., appear at a different location from the one it departed), similar to the [[TARDIS]] from ''[[Doctor Who]]''. The cartoon DeLorean time machine has many add-ons, including a back seat in normal two-door mode, the ability to transform into a four-door, a pop-out covered wagon top, a blimp, a rear video screen, and a voice activated time input.

''[[Back to the Future: The Game]]'' features a chronal duplicate of the original DeLorean, which Doc Brown recovered from the timestream after the destruction of the original. This DeLorean is created at the end of ''[[Back to the Future Part II]]'', when the original time machine was struck by lightning: while the DeLorean itself is sent to 1885, a fully functional duplicate appears (apparently unmanned and undamaged) in 2025, where Doc retrieves it with the Hover Train. He later traveled to 1931 and sent the DeLorean to 1986 to get Marty to rescue him from 1931 before he can be killed. This duplicate DeLorean is effectively the same as the Part II car, including the occasional glitches in the time controls (mostly affecting the last time departed time display), but with a new automatic retrieval feature that automatically brings the DeLorean to a set time and location of Doc's choosing every time Doc Brown doesn't return to the car in a fixed amount of time.&lt;ref name="bttftvg1"&gt;''Back to the Future: The Game, Chapter 1 – It's About Time''&lt;/ref&gt;

This DeLorean is later badly damaged (Marty crashes the DeLorean into a billboard, and after Marty gets out, the DeLorean falls through the billboard and crashes onto the ground) and then restored by an alternate version of Doc Brown who has never developed time travel technology, having access to limited notes about the flux capacitor. As such, the chronal circuits of the duplicate DeLorean become even more glitchy, accumulating errors as severe as the interval of time traveled, with increasing damage with every attempt: as such, Citizen Brown, the Alternate Doc, has to install a diagnostic console made of materials available in 1931 (appearing as a plywood box with a lightbulb and several similar bulbs placed on the coils on the outer body).&lt;ref name="bttftvg4"&gt;''Back to the Future: The Game, Chapter 4 – Double Visions''&lt;/ref&gt;

Apparently, part of the problem is chromium parts becoming unstable during time travel, according to Alternate Doc. This DeLorean is then stolen by Edna Strickland, one of the game's main villains. The more adept Doc Brown returns in another duplicate DeLorean due to earlier events in the game, although it is unknown where it came from. Then Officer Danny Parker nearly arrests Marty and Doc for allegedly having the car that Edna got away in. After they explain to him that there is more than one DeLorean, Marty explains that the other DeLorean had malfunctioning time circuits. To make matters worse, the entire town of Hill Valley disappears around them. They go to "Mary Pickford's" house and see that the other DeLorean had been destroyed. After they get information from Mary, who was really Edna, they go to 1876. After they stop the fire that would've burned down Hill Valley, they chase down Edna, who is trying to get away in the first DeLorean. Marty synchronizes the two DeLoreans and hoverboards back to Doc's DeLorean, which is flying behind the one Edna's driving. They all travel back to 1931, with Edna's DeLorean duplicate vanishing because of the time ripples catching up with them, causing "[[Time|chronal]] decay" (i.e., since the Alternate Doc timeline ceased to exist, the alternated Clone DeLorean was folded back with the real Clone DeLorean).&lt;ref name="bttftvg5"&gt;''Back to the Future: The Game, Chapter 5 – Outatime''&lt;/ref&gt;

It is implied that the Hover Train stays with Clara, Jules and Verne, passingly mentioned as enjoying the same nomadic life around the time-stream of Doc, but it is never seen in the game. The ending introduces a blue DeLorean and a black DeLorean, but it is unknown how these time machines were created.&lt;ref name="bttftvg1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="bttftvg5" /&gt;

In ''[[Back to the Future: The Ride]]'', Doc, who now lives in a lab, had created an 8-passenger DeLorean that can fly just like the original DeLorean (which can be seen in the ride and in the outside display) and the Hover Train (which can only be seen in display outside of the attraction). Unlike the original DeLorean, the flux capacitor is in the front of the cockpit along with a small screen, the time circuits, and the speedometer. The original DeLorean is also shown to have its original "OUTATIME" license plate instead of the bar code license plate, but it could just mean that this DeLorean is actually a new one being built into a time machine. However, in a post-credits scene, Clara Clayton, who has built Hover Train with Doc, currently repaired the DeLorean and travels back to 1947 to a farm.

In ''[[Doc Brown Saves the World]]'', there was a repaired DeLorean time machine which included new replacement parts from 2015. The DeLorean is also seen in a video promoting ''Doc Brown Saves the World'', and it is unknown as to whether or not a flux capacitor was inside.

The time machine went through several variations during production of the first film, ''[[Back to the Future]]''. In the first draft of the screenplay, the time machine was a laser device that was housed in a room. At the end of the first draft the device was attached to a refrigerator and taken to an atomic bomb test site. Director Robert Zemeckis said in an interview that the idea was scrapped because he did not want children to start climbing into refrigerators and getting trapped inside. In the third draft of the film the time machine was a car, as Zemeckis reasoned that if you were going to make a time machine, you would want it to be mobile.&lt;ref name="1985 making of"&gt;{{cite video | people= Zemeckis, Robert; Gale, Bob|date=1985|title= The making of Back to the Future| medium= VHS|publisher= Universal Pictures}}&lt;/ref&gt; The specific choice of vehicle was a DeLorean DMC-12 for the purposes of it looking like an [[UFO|alien spaceship]]&lt;ref name="DVD"&gt;{{cite video | people= Zemeckis, Robert; Gale, Bob|date=2002|title= Back to the Future: The Complete Trilogy DVD commentary for part 1| medium= DVD|publisher= Universal Pictures}}&lt;/ref&gt; due to its characteristic [[gullwing doors]] (which were inspired by the [[Mercedes-Benz 300 SL]]). However, in order to send Marty back to the future, the vehicle had to drive into a nuclear test site. Ultimately this concept was considered too expensive to film, so the power source was changed to lightning.&lt;ref name="talesfromthefuture"&gt;''Tales From the Future'' (2010 DVD/Blu-ray set documentary)&lt;/ref&gt;

When the filmmakers arrived at the point where the time machine would be built into a car, the art department was instructed to come up with designs for the DeLorean. [[Andrew Probert]] was the first artist to explore the subject (before Ron Cobb joined the production), but his designs were deemed "too perfect" for the look the producers wanted, which was to make it look as if it had been built in a garage by Doc Brown. The idea was that it had been constructed with parts found in a hardware and electronics store, so it couldn't look too sophisticated. It also had to look dangerous, as Producer Bob Gale noted in the DVD commentary for ''Back to the Future''.&lt;ref name="DVD"/&gt; The task was undertaken by Ron Cobb who added the coils to the back of the vehicle. The nuclear reactor was also a design choice made by Cobb. This choice proved to be important, given the direction the script had taken. Cobb complemented the nuclear reactor with one vent on the back of the car, since it was generally known at the time that nuclear reactors had vents. Once Cobb had left the production, the producers wanted to balance the design with another vent, keeping a symmetrical aesthetic. Probert was asked to step in and he brought the design to its final form. At the end of the first film of the trilogy these vents become the propulsion system for the improved DeLorean, which now had hovering abilities and could reach the time-traveling speed of 88 miles per hour flying. The production design team added other buttons and lights inside the car to make it look more appealing and complex in order for the audience to have something attractive to look at.

Different parts from three 1982 DeLoreans were used in the first film. [[Liquid nitrogen]] was poured onto the car for scenes after it had travelled through time to give the impression that it was cold. The base for the nuclear reactor was made from the hubcap from a [[Dodge Polara]]. Aircraft parts and blinking lights were added for effect. In one of the first scenes, [[carbon dioxide]] extinguishers were hidden inside the DeLorean to simulate the exhaust effect.&lt;ref&gt;[Back to the Future Trilogy DVD, Production Notes]&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, five real DeLoreans were used in the filming of the trilogy, plus one "process" car built for interior shots. In the off-road scenes in the third film, a modified-for-off-road VW Beetle frame was fitted to the DeLorean with the whitewall tires and [[Hot rod#Moons|baby Moon]] hubcaps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Klastorin | first = Michael |author2=Hibbin, Sally | title = Back to The Future: The Official Book of The Complete Movie Trilogy | publisher = [[Hamlyn (publishers)|Hamlyn]] | year = 1990 | page = 40 | quote = 6 DeLoreans, including one 'process' car which can be dismantled for easy access, and a lightweight fiberglass model, were used in the filming. | isbn = 0-600-57104-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A seventh DeLorean was also used in the filming; however, this one was merely a full-sized, fiberglass model used for exterior shots where the vehicle hovers above the set as well as when the actors interact with the vehicle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Klastorin | first = Michael |author2=Hibbin, Sally | title = Back to The Future: The Official Book of The Complete Movie Trilogy | publisher = [[Hamlyn (publishers)|Hamlyn]] | year = 1990 | page = 43 | quote = A lightweight, full-size fibreglass DeLorean was built, complete with radio-controlled wheels.

Rather than use the sound of the stock V-6 DeLorean engine in the film, the sound of a DMC-12 with a Legend Twin Turbo VIN 530 was used.

==Replicas==
[[File:Back to future-deloran-dmc-time machine-2x-terabass.jpg|thumb|Two DeLorean time machine replicas]]
A number of private auto customizers have built replicas of the DeLorean time machine. Starting with a stock DMC-12, they added most, if not all, the props used by the movie producers for the picture cars. In addition to the interior and exterior props, they feature working indicator lights and switches along with the actual sounds which duplicate the ones made by the movie car's controls when activated. These vehicles are, for the most part, roadworthy DeLoreans with stock drivetrains, and are frequently driven to car shows and ''Back to the Future''-related events.

Replicas can range from a minimal 'obligatory mod' - typically in the form of an operational Flux-Capacitor prop on the rear firewall of an otherwise stock Delorean DMC-12, all the way through to complete replicas, as described above.

As of March 2017, some 87 DeLorean DMC-12s are known to be converted to ''Back to the Future'' Time Machines.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.citizenkidd.com/dmc/pages/vinview_totals_spec.asp?vinstart=14&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5077">:''For distributed propulsion on rail see: [[Multiple unit]]''

'''Distributed propulsion''' (DP) is a type of powered flight propulsion system for [[fixed-wing aircraft]] in which engines are distributed about a vessel. Its goal is to increase performance in fuel efficiency, emissions, noise, landing field length and handling performance. DP is typically accomplished by spanwise distribution of partially or fully embedded multiple small engines or fans along the wing. Alternatively, it may involve ducting exhaust gases along the wing's entire trailing edge.

== Definition ==
Distributed propulsion spreads thrust around the aircraft, either by using three or more smaller propulsion units (engines, propulsors, thrusters or others) or by ducting exhaust gases to three or more locations. 

The multiple propulsion unit strategy involves three or more propulsion units . These units are arranged in Leader or Follower configurations. They are classified into five intensity classes (A–E) and three thrust-to-weight ratio categories (I-III). They can be arranged within/above/around or across the wing(s)/fuselage(s) or airframe. 

=== Distributed fans ===
Leader arrangements employ propulsion units to directly generate thrust, i.e., distributed engines. The Follower arrangement uses secondary  propulsion unit(s), such as multiple fans that are powered by a single engine. In the last case, the power transmission between the fans and engines may be linked by ducting hot gas, mechanical gears, or electric power lines.

=== Intensity classes ===
Intensity classes group designs according to the number of propulsion units they employ.

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Distributed propulsion intensity classes !! A !! B !! C !! D !! E
|-
| Number of propulsion units || 3 || 4-6 || 7-10 || 11-20 || 20&lt;
|}

=== Thrust-to-weight ratios ===
For distributed propulsion, this ratio can be defined as the total aircraft thrust produced divided by the Maximum Take-Off Weight (MTOW) rather than dividing only by the propulsion unit weight, given the strategy's potential to reduce the weight of the rest of the aircraft.
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Thrust-to-weight ratio intensity classes !! I !! II !! III
|-
| Thrust-to-weight ratio based on MTOW || &lt;0.10 || 0.10 to &lt;0.15 || 0.15&lt;
|}

=== Example ===
Thus, the following convention describes specific systems:

DP Configuration (L/F)-Intensity class (A-E)-Thrust-to-weight (I-III)-(X)

For example, the 1945s Blohm and Voss 238 V1 aircraft would be denoted as DPL-B-I,since the aircraft employs six piston engines and has a thrust-to-weight ratio less than 0.10.

== Additional functions ==
In addition to providing propulsion, distributed propulsion arrangements may provide the following functions:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0376042112000735 Gohardani, A.S. 'A synergistic glance at the prospects of distributed propulsion technology and the electric aircraft concept for future unmanned air vehicles and commercial/military aviation', Progress in Aerospace Sciences, Volume 57, February 2013, Pages 25-70:]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Direct reenergizing of the boundary layer
* Flow separation control
* Powered lift/circulation control
* Viscous drag reduction
* Noise reduction/noise spectrum alteration
* Vortex/vorticity control
* Vehicle control/vectored thrust
* Reduced signatures
* Redundancy
* Lower costs

== Aircraft designs ==
These implementations are often proposed in conjunction with [[blended wing body]] (BWB) or hybrid wing body (HWB) aircraft.

While some of these concepts were tested on full scale aircraft in the 1960 - 1970s, such as the [[Hunting H.126]], they were not fielded in production aircraft. More recently, several full-size and smaller [[unmanned aerial vehicle]] (UAV) projects have proposed DP approaches to meet noise abatement, fuel efficiency and landing field length goals. Advancements in materials engineering, cryogenic cooling systems, novel fuels and high fidelity computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modeling and analysis have been credited for the renewed interest.

== Benefits ==
Recent analytic and experimental distributed propulsion studies suggest several improvements in aircraft performance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=ADA516809&amp;Location=U2&amp;doc=GetTRDoc.pdf Epstein, A. 'Distributed Propulsion: New Opportunities For An Old Concept'.  Report (2007)]&lt;/ref&gt;  They include fuel consumption efficiency, noise abatement, steep climbing for [[STOL|short take off and landing]] (STOL), novel control approaches (in particular eliminating control surfaces for roll, pitch and yaw moments), and high bypass ratios. It has also been suggested that smaller propulsors will be cheaper to manufacture and easier to handle during assembly and maintenance.&lt;ref&gt;Kim, Hyun Dae, ‘Distributed Propulsion Vehicles’, in 27th International Congress of the Aeronautical Sciences, 2011, pp. 1–11.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''drum''' is a [[cylinder (geometry)|cylindrical]] [[container]] used for shipping [[bulk cargo]]. Drums can be made of [[steel]], dense [[paperboard]] (commonly called a '''fiber drum'''), or [[plastic]]s, and are generally used for the transportation and storage of liquids and powders. Drums are often certified for shipment of  [[dangerous goods]]. Shipped goods must be matched with the make of drum necessary to comply with applicable regulations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.fmcsa.dot.gov/safety-security/hazmat/complyhmregs.htm#hm |title=How to Comply with Federal Hazardous Materials Regulations |publisher=United States Department of Transportation |date=2 April 2014 | accessdate=23 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Drums are also called [[barrel]]s in common usage.

==Background==
[[File:Drum capseal crimping tool.jpg|thumb|upright|Hand-operated drum capseal crimping tool]]
It is common to hear a drum referred to as a barrel and the two terms are used nearly interchangeably. Many drums have a common nominal volume of {{convert|208|L|usgal impgal|0|lk=on}} and nominally measure just under {{convert|880|mm|in}} tall with a diameter just under {{convert|610|mm|in}} and differ by holding about thirteen gallons more than a [[barrel (volume)#Oil barrel|barrel of crude oil]]. In the United States, {{convert|25|USgal|adj=on}} drums are also in common use and have the same height. This allows easy stacking of mixed pallets. Barrels can be constructed of plastic, laminated [[paperboard]] or steel.

The two common '''sub-types of drums''' are the '''open top''' and the '''welded top''' (with {{convert|2|in|adj=on|order=flip}} [[Nominal Pipe Size|NPS]] bung holes). The latter are almost universally called "barrels" in preference to ''drums'' in the United States. They cannot efficaciously either dispense or be filled with powdered goods, though they might ''store'' them very well, so are not used for such goods, being reserved for liquids transport and storage. Plastic drums are manufactured using [[blow molding|injection blow moulding]] technology and have either a separate lid (similar to those on fiber drums) or a welded type top with the bung holes molded in. Metal drums are manufactured with cold-rolled steel sheets, welded themselves into long pipe-like sections then ''forged'' on a [[stamping press]] into drum bodies. A rolled seam is then made for the drum bottom, or bottom and top both.

Some drums have reinforcing rings of thickened metal or plastic, called "chimes", at four places: top, bottom, and one each a third of the way from each end ring. This sufficiently strengthens them so that they can readily be turned on their sides and rolled when filled with heavy materials, like liquids. Over short to medium distances, drums can be tipped and rolled on the bottom rim while being held at an angle, balanced, and rotated with a two-handed top grip that also supplies the torque (rotational or rolling force).

The open-top sub-type is sealed by a mechanical ring clamp (concave inwards) that exerts sufficient pressure to hold many non-volatile liquids and make an airtight seal against a gasket, as it exerts force inward and downward when tightened by a normal three-quarter inch wrench or ratchet wrench. Tops exist with bung holes as above, and these hybrid drums with lid can be used to ship many non-volatile liquids as well as industrial powders. Many drums are used to ship and store powdered products as well as liquids, such as plastic beads for injection moulding, extrusion, and purified industrial grade powders like cleansers (e.g., fertilizers, and powdered aluminum). If used to transport dangerous goods across international boundaries, they may need to have UN certification. In general, drum usage is limited to wholesale distribution of bulk products, which are then further processed or sub-divided in a factory.

These metal drums have two openings with flanges (2 in [[Nominal Pipe Size|NPS]] and ¾ in [[Nominal Pipe Size|NPS]]). Once the drums are filled, the plugs (bungs) are screwed in the flanges using pneumatic or hand operated bung tightener (plug wrench).  To secure the contents of the drums against theft and adulteration during shipment, cap-seals made of metal and other types like metal-plastic laminates are used. These cap-seals sit on top of the flanges and are crimped, using a drum cap-seal crimping tool, also called a drum cap sealer. Once cap-seals are crimped, the plugs can be unscrewed only by breaking these cap-seals. Pneumatic and hand-operated cap-seal crimping tools are available. Pneumatic ones are used in production lines for high production.

The fiber drums referred to above will easily hold {{convert|180|-|270|kg|-1}}, and are usually coated internally with a urethane or plastic protective coating. They have steel reinforcement rims at their ends, and are sufficiently strong that this is the only type of drum that is not reinforced in the middle third, but that is almost certainly due to the difficulty in creating a "vee" rib in a paper layer that essentially spirals out from a single end seam.

==International standard size==
[[File:Fuel Barrels.JPG|thumb|right|Steel drums used as [[shipping container]]s for chemicals and other liquids.]]

A 200-litre drum (known as a 55-gallon drum in the United States and a 44-gallon drum in the [[United Kingdom]]) is a cylindrical container with a nominal capacity of 200 litres (55&amp;nbsp;US or 44&amp;nbsp;imp gal). The exact capacity varies by manufacturer, purpose, or other factors. Standard drums have inside dimensions of {{convert|22.5|in|mm|0|lk=out|order=flip}} diameter and {{convert|33.5|in|mm|0|order=flip}} height. These dimensions yield a volume of about 218,681 dm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; or {{convert|218.681|L|usgal impgal|1}}, but they are commonly filled to about 200 litres.

The outside dimensions of a 200-litre drum are typically {{convert|23|in|mm|0|order=flip}} diameter at the top or bottom rim, {{convert|23.5|in|mm|0|order=flip}} diameter at the chines (ridges around drum), and {{convert|34.5|in|mm|0|order=flip}} height. Exact dimensions are specified in ANSI MH2.

The drums are typically made of steel with a ribbed outer wall to improve rigidity and for rolling. The lids can be welded or secured with a head gasket and bolt ring.  Drums can also be made of durable plastic or paperboard. They are commonly used for transporting [[oil]]s, [[fuel]]s, chemicals, and dry goods. The construction and performance of drums used for shipment of [[Dangerous goods|hazardous materials]] are governed by UN, country, and carrier regulations.

Drums are frequently transported on pallets for ease of handling by a [[forklift truck|fork truck]] and for shipping. The drum's size, shape, and weight distribution lends itself to being moved about readily on the loading dock or factory floor with a two-wheeled [[hand truck]]. They can be turned on side and rolled. They can also be moved by hand short distances on firm surfaces by tilting and then rolling along the base, or by using a [[drum handler]], which is designed especially for that purpose.

Henry Wehrhahn, employee of [[Nellie Bly|Nellie Bly’s]] Iron Clad Manufacturing Company of New York, received two patents in December 1905 that would lead to the modern 55-gallon steel barrel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://aoghs.org/transportation/nellie-bly-oil-drum/|title=Nellie Bly Oil Drum - American Oil &amp; Gas Historical Society|date=2015-05-12|website=American Oil &amp; Gas Historical Society|language=en-US|access-date=2016-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Use of 200-litre drums became widespread in [[World War II]], the first war in which [[truck]]s, [[Rolling (metalworking)|cold rolled steel]], stamp or pattern forging machinery and [[welding]] were widely available. They were first developed by the Axis powers (Germany and Italy), but were quickly adopted by Allies.&lt;ref name=Lindsay&gt;{{cite book|last=Lindsay|first=N.R|title=Equal to the Task - The Royal Australian Service Corps|year=1991|publisher=Historia Productions|isbn=978-0-9808415-0-3|pages=Chapter 17|url=http://books.historia.com.au/equal-to-the-task_v1-raasc/e1-p4_infra/e1-c17_o-f.html|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304035522/http://books.historia.com.au/equal-to-the-task_v1-raasc/e1-p4_infra/e1-c17_o-f.html|archivedate=2016-03-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The drums helped win the [[Guadalcanal Campaign]] in the first U.S. offensive in the [[Asiatic-Pacific Theater|South Pacific Theater]]. The U.S. Navy could not maintain [[command of the sea]] long enough to offload [[Avgas|aviation gasoline]] for aircraft ashore, so the drums were often transported to the island on fast ships, such as [[destroyer]]s, and shoved over the sides (or, time permitting, lowered in cargo nets). Because gasoline's density is much less than that of water, the drums floated.  Navy [[Seabee]]s in small craft corralled the drums.

Closed-head [[steel]] barrels and drums used for shipment of chemicals and petroleum products have a standardised [[bunghole]] arrangement, with one {{convert|2|in|adj=on|order=flip}} (DN50) [[National pipe thread|NPT]] and one {{convert|3/4|in|adj=on|order=flip}} (DN20) NPT threaded bunghole on opposite sides of the top head. This arrangement is echoed in many plastic drums in the same size. Various components can be mounted to the drum, such as drum pumps and bung mixers.

In the past, [[hazardous waste]] was often placed in drums of this size and stored in open fields or buried. Over time, some drums would [[Corrosion|corrode]] and leak. As a result, these drums have become iconic of pollution problems, even though they have numerous uses and are ubiquitous in commerce. Drums are often cleaned or re-conditioned and then used for storing or shipping various liquids or materials.

Drums are frequently reused for many purposes including as barricades to protect construction workers from oncoming traffic, and perhaps most famously as [[Steelpan|musical instruments]].

Although [[Petroleum|crude oil]] is sometimes shipped in 55-US-gallon drums, the measurement of oil in [[Barrel (unit)|barrels]] is based on the [[Whisky|whiskey]] barrels of the 1870s which measured {{convert|42|usgal|impgal L|0}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.slate.com/id/2115219/ Does oil come in barrels? - By Daniel Engber - Slate Magazine&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  The measure of 42 US or wine gallons, corresponds to a wine tierce (third-pipe).  A wine barrel, or 1/8 tun, measures {{convert|31.5|usgal|impgal L|1}}.

'''Dynamic frequency scaling''' (also known as '''CPU throttling''') is a technique in [[computer architecture]] whereby the [[Clock rate|frequency]] of a microprocessor can be automatically adjusted "on the fly" depending on the actual needs, to [[Power management integrated circuit|conserve power]] and reduce the amount of heat generated by the chip. Dynamic frequency scaling helps preserve battery on mobile devices&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.academia.edu/4186102/A_survey_of_techniques_for_improving_energy_efficiency_in_embedded_computing_systems A survey of techniques for improving energy efficiency in embedded computing systems]", IJCAET, 2014 &lt;/ref&gt; and decrease cooling cost and noise on [[Quiet PC|quiet computing settings]], or can be useful as a security measure for overheated systems (e.g. after poor [[overclocking]]). Dynamic frequency scaling is used in all ranges of computing systems, ranging from mobile systems to data centers&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.academia.edu/6982393/Power_Management_Techniques_for_Data_Centers_A_Survey Power Management Techniques for Data Centers: A Survey]", ORNL Technical Report, 2014 &lt;/ref&gt; to reduce the power at the times of low workload. 

== Functioning ==

The dynamic power (''[[switching power]]'') dissipated per unit of time by a chip is ''C·V&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;·A·f'', where C is the [[capacitance]] being switched per clock cycle, V is [[voltage]], A is the Activity Factor&lt;ref name="ActivityFactor"&gt;{{cite journal | title = Timing-aware power-optimal ordering of signals | author = K. Moiseev, A. Kolodny and S. Wimer | work = ACM Transactions on Design Automation of Electronic Systems, Volume 13 Issue 4, September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; indicating the average number of switching events undergone by the transistors in the chip (as a unitless quantity) and f is the switching frequency.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first=J. M.|last= Rabaey|title= Digital Integrated Circuits|publisher= Prentice Hall|year= 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Voltage is therefore the main determinant of power usage and heating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://software.intel.com/en-us/blogs/2014/02/19/why-has-cpu-frequency-ceased-to-grow|author= Victoria Zhislina|date=2014-02-19|title=Why has CPU frequency ceased to grow?|publisher=Intel}}&lt;/ref&gt; The voltage required for stable operation is determined by the frequency at which the circuit is clocked, and can be reduced if the frequency is also reduced.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.usenix.org/legacy/events/hotpower/tech/full_papers/LeSueur.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Dynamic power alone does not account for the total power of the chip, however, as there is also static power, which is primarily because of various leakage currents. Due to static power consumption and asymptotic execution time it has been shown that the energy consumption of a piece of software shows convex energy behavior, i.e., there exists an optimal CPU frequency at which energy consumption is minimal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = K. De Vogeleer| title = The Energy/Frequency Convexity Rule:  Modeling and Experimental Validation on Mobile Devices |year=2014 | arxiv = 1401.4655|display-authors=etal|bibcode=2014arXiv1401.4655D}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Subthreshold leakage|Leakage current]] has become more and more important as transistor sizes have become smaller and threshold voltage levels lower. A decade ago, dynamic power accounted for approximately two-thirds of the total chip power. The power loss due to leakage currents in contemporary CPUs and SoCs tend to dominate the total power consumption. In the attempt to control the leakage power, [[High-κ dielectric|high-k metal-gates]] and power gating have been common methods.

[[Dynamic voltage scaling]] is another related power conservation technique that is often used in conjunction with frequency scaling, as the frequency that a chip may run at is related to the operating voltage.

The efficiency of some electrical components, such as voltage regulators, decreases with increasing temperature, so the power usage may increase with temperature.  Since increasing power use may increase the temperature, increases in voltage or frequency may increase system power demands even further than the CMOS formula indicates, and vice versa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.silentpcreview.com/article821-page5.html | title = Asus EN9600GT Silent Edition Graphics Card | author = Mike Chin | page = 5 | work = Silent PC Review | accessdate = 21 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SPCRNewLevels"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.silentpcreview.com/article814-page1.html | title = 80 Plus expands podium for Bronze, Silver &amp; Gold | author = MIke Chin | work = Silent PC Review | accessdate = 21 April 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Performance impact==
Dynamic frequency scaling reduces the number of instructions a processor can issue in a given amount of time, thus reducing performance. Hence, it is generally used when the workload is not CPU-bound.

Dynamic frequency scaling by itself is rarely worthwhile as a way to conserve switching power.  Saving the highest possible amount of power requires dynamic voltage scaling too, because of the V&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; component and the fact that modern CPUs are strongly optimized for low power idle states.  In most constant-voltage cases, it is more efficient to run briefly at peak speed and stay in a deep idle state for longer time (called "race to idle" or computational sprinting), than it is to run at a reduced clock rate for a long time and only stay briefly in a light idle state.  However, reducing voltage along with clock rate can change those tradeoffs.

A related-but-opposite technique is [[overclocking]], whereby processor performance is increased by ramping the processor's (dynamic) frequency beyond the manufacturer's design specifications.

One major difference between the two is that in modern PC systems overclocking is mostly done over the [[Front Side Bus]] (mainly because the multiplier is normally locked), but dynamic frequency scaling is done with the [[CPU multiplier|multiplier]].  Moreover, overclocking is often static, while dynamic frequency scaling is always dynamic.  Software can often incorporate overclocked frequencies into the frequency scaling algorithm, if the chip degradation risks are allowable.

==Implementations==
[[Intel]]'s CPU throttling technology, [[SpeedStep]], is used in its mobile and desktop CPU lines.

[[AMD]] employs two different CPU throttling technologies. AMD's [[Cool'n'Quiet]] technology is used on its desktop and server processor lines.  The aim of Cool'n'Quiet is not to save battery life, as it is not used in AMD's mobile processor line, but instead with the purpose of producing less heat, which in turn allows the system fan to spin down to slower speeds, resulting in cooler and quieter operation, hence the name of the technology.  AMD's [[PowerNow!]] CPU throttling technology is used in its mobile processor line, though some supporting CPUs like the [[AMD K6-2]]+ can be found in desktops as well.

[[VIA Technologies]] processors use a technology named [[LongHaul]] (PowerSaver), while [[Transmeta]]'s version was called [[LongRun]].

The 36-processor [[Asynchronous array of simple processors|AsAP 1]] chip is among the first multi-core processor chips to support completely unconstrained clock operation (requiring only that frequencies are below the maximum allowed) including arbitrary changes in frequency, starts, and stops.  The 167-processor [[Asynchronous array of simple processors|AsAP 2]] chip is the first multi-core processor chip which enables individual processors to make fully unconstrained changes to their own clock frequencies.

According to the [[Advanced Configuration and Power Interface|ACPI]] Specs, the C0 working state of a modern-day CPU can be divided into the so-called "P"-states (performance states) which allow clock rate reduction and "T"-states (throttling states) which will further throttle down a CPU (but not the actual clock rate) by inserting STPCLK (stop clock) signals and thus omitting duty cycles.

[[AMD PowerTune]] and [[AMD ZeroCore Power]] are dynamic frequency scaling technologies for [[Graphics processing unit|GPUs]].

The '''Edison and Swan Electric Light Company Limited''' was a manufacturer of [[incandescent lamp bulb]]s and other electrical goods. It was formed in 1883 with the name '''Edison &amp; Swan United Electric Light Company''' with the merger of the Swan United Electric Company and the Edison Electric Light Company.&lt;ref name=science/&gt;&lt;ref name="times1" /&gt;

[[Thomas Edison]] established the Edison Electric Light Company in 1878.  [[Joseph Swan]] established the Swan United Electric Light Company in 1881.  In 1882 the American Edison Company of [[Thomas Edison]] sued Swan, claiming infringement of Edison's U.S. patent of 1879; however, they never made it to court and instead negotiated a merger with Swan's company.&lt;ref name=stath/&gt; The lamps sold in Britain were almost entirely to Swan's design, excepting the filaments.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; From 1887 or earlier Sir [[Ambrose Fleming]] was an adviser to the company, and conducted research at Ponders End.&lt;ref name=ucl/&gt;

The company had offices at 155 [[Charing Cross Road]], London, and factories in [[Brimsdown]], [[Ponders End]] and [[Sunderland, Tyne and Wear|Sunderland]]. In 1928, the company was acquired by [[Associated Electrical Industries]]. In 1956, a new cathode ray tube plant was opened in Sunderland. The company was renamed Siemens Ediswan following the takeover of [[Siemens Brothers]] by AEI in 1957. In 1964, AEI merged its lamp and radio valve manufacturing interests with those of [[Thorn Electrical Industries]] to form British Lighting Industries Ltd.&lt;ref name=science/&gt;

==Ediswan Valves==
Edison Swan (or later Siemens Edison Swan) produced a wide range of [[thermionic valve|vacuum tube]]s and [[cathode ray tube]]s under the names "Ediswan" or "Mazda"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of the radio manufacturer Ediswan (Brand) Edison Swan Electric Co.Ltd.|url=http://www.radiomuseum.org/dsp_hersteller_detail.cfm?Company_id=4393|accessdate=23 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the 1964 Mazda Valve Data Book claimed: "Professor Sir. Ambrose Fleming... was Technical Consultant to the Edison Swan Company at the time.  It was this close co-operation between University and Factory which resulted in the first radio valve in the world."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mazda Valves|url=http://www.vintage-technology.info/pages/ephemera/vemazda.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130628205923/http://www.vintage-technology.info/pages/ephemera/vemazda.htm|archivedate=2013-06-28|accessdate=2017-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Energy development''' is the field of activities focused on obtaining sources of energy from natural resources. These activities include production of conventional, [[Alternative energy|alternative]] and [[Renewable energy|renewable]] sources of energy, and for the [[Waste heat|recovery and reuse of energy]] that would otherwise be wasted. [[Energy conservation]] and [[Efficient energy use|efficiency measures]] reduce the demand for energy development, and can have benefits to society with improvements to [[environmental issue]]s.

Societies use energy for transportation, manufacturing, illumination, heating and air conditioning, and communication, for industrial, commercial, and domestic purposes.  Energy resources may be classified as primary resources, where the resource can be used in substantially its original form, or as secondary resources, where the energy source must be converted into a more conveniently usable form. Non-renewable resources are significantly depleted by human use, whereas renewable resources are produced by ongoing processes that can sustain indefinite human exploitation.

Thousands of people are employed in the [[energy industry]]. The conventional industry comprises the [[petroleum industry]], the natural gas industry, the [[electrical power industry]], and the [[nuclear industry]]. New energy industries include the [[renewable energy industry]], comprising alternative and sustainable manufacture, distribution, and sale of [[alternative fuel]]s.

Energy resources may be classified as primary resources, suitable for end use without conversion to another form, or secondary resources, where the usable form of energy required substantial conversion from a primary source.  Examples of primary energy resources are [[wind power]], [[solar power]], wood fuel, fossil fuels such as coal, oil and natural gas, and uranium. Secondary resources are those such as electricity, [[hydrogen economy|hydrogen]], or other synthetic fuels.

Another important classification is based on the time required to regenerate an energy resource.  "Renewable" resources are those that recover their capacity in a time significant by human needs. Examples are hydroelectric power or wind power, when the natural phenomena that are the primary source of energy are ongoing and not depleted by human demands.  Non-renewable resources are those that are significantly depleted by human usage and that will not recover their potential significantly during human lifetimes. An example of a non-renewable energy source is coal, which does not form naturally at a rate that would support human use.

== Fossil fuels ==

{{Main|Fossil fuel|Peak oil}}

Fossil fuel (''primary non-renewable fossil'') sources burn [[coal]] or [[hydrocarbon]] fuels, which are the remains of the decomposition of plants and animals. There are three main types of fossil fuels: coal, [[petroleum]], and [[natural gas]]. Another fossil fuel, [[liquefied petroleum gas]] (LPG), is principally derived from the production of natural gas. Heat from burning fossil fuel is used either directly for space heating and process heating, or converted to mechanical energy for vehicles, [[industrial process]]es, or [[electrical power generation]]. These fossil fuels are part of the [[carbon cycle]] and thus allow stored solar energy to be used today.

The use of fossil fuels in the 18th and 19th Century set the stage for the [[Industrial Revolution]].

Fossil fuels make up the bulk of the world's current [[primary energy]] sources. In 2005, 81% of the world's energy needs was met from fossil sources.&lt;ref&gt;International Energy Agency: Key World Energy Statistics 2007. S. 6&lt;/ref&gt; The technology and infrastructure already exist for the use of fossil fuels. Liquid fuels derived from petroleum deliver a great deal of usable energy per unit of weight or volume, which is advantageous when compared with lower [[energy density]] sources such as a [[battery (electricity)|battery]]. Fossil fuels are currently economical for decentralised energy use.

Conventional production of oil has [[peak oil|peaked]], conservatively, between 2007 and 2010.

[[Nuclear power]] is the use of [[nuclear fission]]  to generate useful [[heat]] and [[electricity]]. Fission of uranium produces nearly all economically significant nuclear power. [[Radioisotope thermoelectric generator]]s form a very small component of energy generation, mostly in specialized applications such as deep space vehicles.

[[Nuclear power plant]]s, excluding [[Nuclear marine propulsion|naval reactors]], provided about 5.7% of the world's energy and 13% of the world's electricity in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;

Recent experiments in extraction of uranium use polymer ropes that are coated with a substance that selectively absorbs uranium from seawater. This process could make the considerable volume of uranium dissolved in seawater exploitable for energy production.  Since ongoing geologic processes carry uranium to the sea in amounts comparable to the amount that would be extracted by this process, in a sense the sea-borne uranium becomes a sustainable resource.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/jamesconca/2016/07/01/uranium-seawater-extraction-makes-nuclear-power-completely-renewable/#34e87e246e2a|title=Uranium Seawater Extraction Makes Nuclear Power Completely Renewable|first=James|last=Conca|date=|website=forbes.com|accessdate=4 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180424213313/https://www.forbes.com/sites/jamesconca/2016/07/01/uranium-seawater-extraction-makes-nuclear-power-completely-renewable/#34e87e246e2a|archivedate=24 April 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://pubs.acs.org/toc/iecred/55/15#UraniuminSeawater April 20, 2016 Volume 55, Issue 15 Pages 4101-4362 In this issue:Uranium in Seawater] Page 962 to 965&lt;/ref&gt;

The economics of new nuclear power plants is a controversial subject, since there are diverging views on this topic, and multibillion-dollar investments ride on the choice of an energy source. [[Nuclear power plant]]s typically have high capital costs for building the plant, but low direct fuel costs.

In recent years there has been a slowdown of electricity demand growth and financing has become more difficult, which affects large projects such as nuclear reactors, with very large upfront costs and long project cycles which carry a large variety of risks.&lt;ref name=kidd2011/&gt; In Eastern Europe, a number of long-established projects are struggling to find finance, notably Belene in Bulgaria and the additional reactors at Cernavoda in Romania, and some potential backers have pulled out.&lt;ref name=kidd2011&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.neimagazine.com/story.asp?sectioncode=147&amp;storyCode=2058653 |title=New reactors—more or less? |author=Kidd, Steve |date=January 21, 2011 |work=Nuclear Engineering International |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111212195417/http://www.neimagazine.com/story.asp?sectioncode=147&amp;storyCode=2058653 |archivedate=2011-12-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Where cheap gas is available and its future supply relatively secure, this also poses a major problem for nuclear projects.&lt;ref name=kidd2011/&gt;

=== Hydroelectricity ===

[[Hydroelectricity]]  is electric power generated by [[hydropower]]; the force of falling or flowing water. In 2015 hydropower generated 16.6% of the world's total electricity and 70% of all renewable electricity &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ren21.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/GSR_2016_Full_Report_REN21.pdf|format=pdf|access-date=2017-05-24|title=Renewables 2016: Global Status Report|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170525173336/http://www.ren21.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/GSR_2016_Full_Report_REN21.pdf|archivedate=2017-05-25|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2017}} and is expected to increase about 3.1% each year for the next 25 years.

Hydropower is produced in 150 countries, with the Asia-Pacific region generating 32 percent of global hydropower in 2010. China is the largest hydroelectricity producer, with 721 terawatt-hours of production in 2010, representing around 17 percent of domestic electricity use. There are now three hydroelectricity plants larger than 10 GW: the [[Three Gorges Dam]] in China, [[Itaipu Dam]] across the Brazil/Paraguay border, and [[Guri Dam]] in Venezuela.&lt;ref name=wi2012&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.worldwatch.org/node/9527 |title=Use and Capacity of Global Hydropower Increases |author=Worldwatch Institute |date=January 2012 |work= |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140924062448/http://www.worldwatch.org/node/9527 |archivedate=2014-09-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cost of hydroelectricity is relatively low, making it a competitive source of renewable electricity. The average cost of electricity from a hydro plant larger than 10 megawatts is 3 to 5 U.S. cents per kilowatt-hour.&lt;ref name=wi2012/&gt; Hydro is also a flexible source of electricity since plants can be ramped up and down very quickly to adapt to changing energy demands. However, damming interrupts the flow of rivers and can harm local ecosystems, and building large dams and reservoirs often involves displacing people and wildlife.&lt;ref name=wi2012/&gt; Once a hydroelectric complex is constructed, the project produces no direct waste, and has a considerably lower output level of the [[greenhouse gas]] [[carbon dioxide]] than [[fossil fuel]] powered energy plants.&lt;ref name="REN21-2011"&gt;[http://www.ren21.net/Portals/97/documents/GSR/REN21_GSR2011.pdf Renewables 2011 Global Status Report, page 25, Hydropower] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120409013321/http://www.ren21.net/Portals/97/documents/GSR/REN21_GSR2011.pdf |date=April 9, 2012 }}, ''[[REN21]]'', published 2011, accessed 2011-11-7.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Solar energy]], radiant [[light]] and [[heat]] from the [[sun]], is harnessed using a range of ever-evolving technologies such as [[solar heating]], [[solar photovoltaics]], [[solar thermal electricity]], [[solar architecture]] and [[artificial photosynthesis]].&lt;ref name=ie11/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Solar Fuels and Artificial Photosynthesis.

Solar technologies are broadly characterized as either [[passive solar]] or [[active solar]] depending on the way they capture, convert and distribute solar energy. Active solar techniques include the use of photovoltaic panels and [[solar thermal energy|solar thermal]] collectors to harness the energy. Passive solar techniques include orienting a building to the Sun, selecting materials with favorable [[thermal mass]] or light dispersing properties, and designing spaces that [[Ventilation (architecture)|naturally circulate air]].

In 2011, the [[International Energy Agency]] said that "the development of affordable, inexhaustible and clean solar energy technologies will have huge longer-term benefits. It will increase countries’ energy security through reliance on an indigenous, inexhaustible and mostly [[energy independence|import-independent resource]], enhance [[sustainability]], reduce pollution, lower the costs of mitigating [[climate change]], and keep [[fossil fuel]] prices lower than otherwise. These advantages are global. Hence the additional costs of the incentives for early deployment should be considered learning investments; they must be wisely spent and need to be widely shared".&lt;ref name=ie11&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iea.org/Textbase/npsum/solar2011SUM.pdf |title=Solar Energy Perspectives: Executive Summary |year=2011 |format=PDF |publisher=International Energy Agency |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/63fIHKr1S?url=http://www.iea.org/Textbase/npsum/solar2011SUM.pdf |archivedate=2011-12-03 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; More than 100 countries use solar PV.

[[Photovoltaics]] (PV) is a method of [[Electricity generation|generating electrical power]] by converting [[solar radiation]] into [[direct current]] [[electricity]] using [[semiconductor]]s that exhibit the [[photovoltaic effect]]. Photovoltaic power generation employs [[solar panel]]s composed of a number of [[solar cell]]s containing a photovoltaic material. Materials presently used for photovoltaics include [[monocrystalline silicon]], [[polycrystalline silicon]], [[amorphous silicon]], [[cadmium telluride]], and [[copper indium gallium selenide]]/sulfide.

A biofuel is a [[fuel]] that contains energy from geologically recent [[carbon fixation]]. These fuels are produced from [[living organisms]]. Examples of this [[carbon fixation]] occur in [[plants]] and [[microalgae]]. These fuels are made by a [[biomass]] conversion (biomass refers to recently living organisms, most often referring to [[plants]] or plant-derived materials). This biomass can be converted to convenient energy containing substances in three different ways: thermal conversion, chemical conversion, and biochemical conversion. This biomass conversion can result in fuel in [[solid]], [[liquid]], or [[gas]] form. This new biomass can be used for biofuels. Biofuels have increased in popularity because of rising [[oil prices]] and the need for [[energy security]].

[[Bioethanol]] is an [[alcohol]] made by [[Ethanol fermentation|fermentation]], mostly from [[carbohydrate]]s produced in [[sugar]] or [[starch]] crops such as [[Maize|corn]] or [[sugarcane]]. [[cellulose|Cellulosic biomass]], derived from non-food sources, such as trees and grasses, is also being developed as a [[feedstock]] for ethanol production. Ethanol can be used as a fuel for vehicles in its pure form, but it is usually used as a [[gasoline]] [[Fuel additive|additive]] to increase octane and improve vehicle emissions. Bioethanol is widely used in the [[Biofuel in the United States|USA]] and in [[Ethanol fuel in Brazil|Brazil]]. Current plant design does not provide for converting the [[lignin]] portion of plant raw materials to fuel components by fermentation.

[[Biodiesel]] is made from [[vegetable oil]]s and [[animal fat]]s. Biodiesel can be used as a fuel for vehicles in its pure form, but it is usually used as a [[diesel fuel|diesel]] additive to reduce levels of particulates, [[carbon monoxide]], and [[hydrocarbon]]s from diesel-powered vehicles. Biodiesel is produced from oils or fats using [[transesterification]] and is the most common biofuel in Europe. However, research is underway on producing renewable fuels from [[Renewable fuels by decarboxylation|decarboxylation]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title = Continuous catalytic deoxygenation of model and algal lipids to fuel-like hydrocarbons over Ni–Al layered double hydroxide|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0920586114008177|accessdate = 2015-06-02|doi=10.1016/j.cattod.2014.12.004|volume=258|pages=284–293|journal=Catalysis Today|author=Santillan-Jimenez Eduardo}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Geothermal ===
{{Main|Geothermal energy}}
[[File:NesjavellirPowerPlant edit2.jpg|thumb|Steam rising from the [[Nesjavellir Geothermal Power Station]] in [[Iceland]]]]

Geothermal energy is [[thermal energy]] generated and stored in the Earth. Thermal energy is the energy that determines the [[temperature]] of matter. The geothermal energy of the Earth's [[Crust (geology)|crust]] originates from the original formation of the planet (20%) and from [[radioactive decay]] of minerals (80%).&lt;ref name=ucsusa&gt;[http://www.ucsusa.org/clean_energy/our-energy-choices/renewable-energy/how-geothermal-energy-works.html How Geothermal energy works] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140925080922/http://www.ucsusa.org/clean_energy/our-energy-choices/renewable-energy/how-geothermal-energy-works.html |date=2014-09-25 }}. Ucsusa.org. Retrieved on 2013-04-24.&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[geothermal gradient]], which is the difference in temperature between the core of the planet and its surface, drives a continuous conduction of thermal energy in the form of [[heat]] from the core to the surface. The adjective ''geothermal'' originates from the Greek roots ''γη (ge)'', meaning earth, and ''θερμος (thermos)'', meaning hot.

[[Earth's internal heat budget|Earth's internal heat]] is thermal energy generated from [[radioactive decay]] and continual heat loss from Earth's formation. Temperatures at the [[core mantle boundary|core-mantle boundary]] may reach over 4000&amp;nbsp;°C (7,200&amp;nbsp;°F).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Lay T., Hernlund J., Buffett B.

From [[hot springs]], geothermal energy has been used for bathing since [[Paleolithic]] times and for [[space heating]] since ancient Roman times, but it is now better known for [[electricity generation]]. Worldwide, 11,400 [[megawatts]] (MW) of geothermal power is online in 24 countries in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bp.com/en/global/corporate/about-bp/statistical-review-of-world-energy-2013/review-by-energy-type/renewable-energy/geothermal-capacity.html |title=Geothermal capacity &amp;#124; About BP &amp;#124; BP Global |publisher=Bp.com |accessdate=2013-10-05 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131006185306/http://www.bp.com/en/global/corporate/about-bp/statistical-review-of-world-energy-2013/review-by-energy-type/renewable-energy/geothermal-capacity.html |archivedate=2013-10-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  An additional 28 gigawatts of direct [[geothermal heating]] capacity is installed for district heating, space heating, spas, industrial processes, desalination and agricultural applications in 2010.&lt;ref name="IPCC"&gt;Fridleifsson, Ingvar B.; Bertani, Ruggero; Huenges, Ernst; Lund, John W.; Ragnarsson, Arni; Rybach, Ladislaus (2008-02-11), O.

Geothermal power is cost effective, reliable, sustainable, and environmentally friendly,&lt;ref&gt;Glassley, William E. (2010). ''Geothermal Energy: Renewable Energy and the Environment'', CRC Press, {{ISBN|9781420075700}}.&lt;/ref&gt; but has historically been limited to areas near [[tectonic plate boundaries]]. Recent technological advances have dramatically expanded the range and size of viable resources, especially for applications such as home heating, opening a potential for widespread exploitation. Geothermal wells release greenhouse gases trapped deep within the earth, but these emissions are much lower per energy unit than those of fossil fuels. As a result, geothermal power has the potential to help mitigate [[global warming]] if widely deployed in place of fossil fuels.

The Earth's geothermal resources are theoretically more than adequate to supply humanity's energy needs, but only a very small fraction may be profitably exploited. Drilling and exploration for deep resources is very expensive. Forecasts for the future of geothermal power depend on assumptions about technology, energy prices, subsidies, and interest rates. Pilot programs like EWEB's customer opt in Green Power Program &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eweb.org/greenpower Green Power] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141015040912/http://www.eweb.org/greenpower |date=2014-10-15 }}. eweb.org&lt;/ref&gt; show that customers would be willing to pay a little more for a renewable energy source like geothermal.

=== Oceanic ===
{{Main|Marine energy}}

'''Marine energy''' or '''marine power''' (also sometimes referred to as '''ocean energy''', '''ocean power''', or '''marine and hydrokinetic energy''') refers to the energy carried by [[ocean wave]]s, [[tide]]s, [[salinity]], and [[Ocean thermal energy|ocean temperature differences]]. The movement of water in the world's oceans creates a vast store of [[kinetic energy]], or energy in motion. This energy can be harnessed to [[Electricity generation|generate]] electricity to power homes, transport and industries.

The term marine energy encompasses both [[wave power]] i.e. power from surface waves, and [[tidal power]] i.e. obtained from the kinetic energy of large bodies of moving water. [[Offshore wind power]] is not a form of marine energy, as wind power is derived from the wind, even if the [[wind turbine]]s are placed over water.
The oceans have a tremendous amount of energy and are close to many if not most concentrated populations. Ocean energy has the potential of providing a substantial amount of new [[renewable energy]] around the world.

=== 100% renewable energy ===
{{Main|100% renewable energy}}

The incentive to use 100% renewable energy, for electricity, transport, or even total primary energy supply globally, has been motivated by [[global warming]] and other ecological as well as economic concerns. [[Renewable energy commercialization|Renewable energy use]] has grown much faster than anyone anticipated.&lt;ref name=pg11&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/rea/news/article/2013/04/100-percent-renewable-vision-building?amp;buffer_share=fdc06 |title=100 Percent Renewable Vision Building |author=Paul Gipe |date=4 April 2013 |work=Renewable Energy World |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006104925/http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/rea/news/article/2013/04/100-percent-renewable-vision-building?amp;buffer_share=fdc06 |archivedate=6 October 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] has said that there are few fundamental technological limits to integrating a portfolio of renewable energy technologies to meet most of total global energy demand.&lt;ref name="IPCC 2011 17"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://srren.ipcc-wg3.de/report/IPCC_SRREN_SPM.pdf |title=Special Report on Renewable Energy Sources and Climate Change Mitigation |author=IPCC |year=2011 |work=Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, United Kingdom and New York, NY, USA |page=17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140111081913/http://srren.ipcc-wg3.de/report/IPCC_SRREN_SPM.pdf |archivedate=2014-01-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the national level, at least 30 nations around the world already have renewable energy contributing more than 20% of energy supply.  Also, Professors S. Pacala and [[Robert H. Socolow]] have developed a series of "[[stabilization wedges]]" that can allow us to maintain our quality of life while avoiding catastrophic climate change, and "renewable energy sources," in aggregate, constitute the largest number of their "wedges." &lt;ref name=Pacala&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.princeton.edu/mae/people/faculty/socolow/Science-2004-SW-1100103-PAPER-AND-SOM.pdf|title=Stabilization Wedges: Solving the Climate Problem for the Next 50 Years with Current Technologies|author1=S.

[[Mark Z. Jacobson]] says producing all new energy with [[wind power]], [[solar power]],  and [[hydropower]] by 2030 is feasible and existing energy supply arrangements could be replaced by 2050. Barriers to implementing the renewable energy plan are seen to be "primarily social and political, not technological or economic". Jacobson says that energy costs with a wind, solar, water system should be similar to today's energy costs.&lt;ref name=enpol2011&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stanford.edu/group/efmh/jacobson/Articles/I/DJEnPolicyPt2.pdf |title=Providing all global energy with wind, water, and solar power, Part II: Reliability, system and transmission costs, and policies |author1=Mark A.

Similarly, in the United States, the independent National Research Council has noted that "sufficient domestic renewable resources exist to allow renewable electricity to play a significant role in future electricity generation and thus help confront issues related to climate change, energy security, and the escalation of energy costs … Renewable energy is an attractive option because renewable resources available in the United States, taken collectively, can supply significantly greater amounts of electricity than the total current or projected domestic demand." .&lt;ref name=NRC&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=12619|title=Electricity from Renewable Resources: Status, Prospects, and Impediments|author=National Research Council|year=2010|pages=4|publisher=National Academies of Science|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140327124031/http://www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=12619|archivedate=2014-03-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics of the "100% renewable energy" approach include [[Vaclav Smil]] and [[James E. Hansen]]. Smil and Hansen are concerned about the [[variable renewable energy|variable output]] of solar and wind power, but [[Amory Lovins]] argues that the [[electricity grid]] can cope, just as it routinely backs up nonworking coal-fired and nuclear plants with working ones.&lt;ref name=lovi12&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/137246/amory-b-lovins/a-farewell-to-fossil-fuels |title=A Farewell to Fossil Fuels |author=Amory Lovins |date=March–April 2012 |work=Foreign Affairs |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120707031832/http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/137246/amory-b-lovins/a-farewell-to-fossil-fuels |archivedate=2012-07-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Google spent $30 million on their RE&lt;C project to develop renewable energy and stave off catastrophic climate change. The project was cancelled after concluding that a best-case scenario for rapid advances in renewable energy could only result in emissions 55 percent below the fossil fuel projections for 2050.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://spectrum.ieee.org/energy/renewables/what-it-would-really-take-to-reverse-climate-change|title=What It Would Really Take to Reverse Climate Change|author=|date=|website=ieee.org|accessdate=4 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161124081052/http://spectrum.ieee.org/energy/renewables/what-it-would-really-take-to-reverse-climate-change|archivedate=24 November 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|Efficient energy use}}

Although increasing the efficiency of energy use is not energy development per se, it may be considered under the topic of energy development since it makes existing energy sources available to do work.&lt;ref&gt;Richard L. Kauffman
[https://web.archive.org/web/20100624132903/http://environment.research.yale.edu/documents/downloads/0-9/03-Kauffman.pdf Obstacles to Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency]. in:  From Silos to Systems: Issues in Clean Energy and Climate Change.  A report on the work of the REIL Network, 2008-2010.  Edited by Parker L et al.  Yale School of Forestry &amp; Environmental Studies 2010&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|22}}

Efficient energy use reduces the amount of energy required to provide products and services. For example, [[building insulation|insulating a home]] allows a building to use less heating and cooling energy to maintain a comfortable temperature. Installing [[fluorescent lamp]]s or natural [[Skylight (window)|skylights]] reduces the amount of energy required for illumination compared to [[incandescent light bulbs]]. [[Compact fluorescent lights]] use two-thirds less energy and may last 6 to 10 times longer than incandescent lights.  Improvements in energy efficiency are most often achieved by adopting an efficient technology or production process.&lt;ref&gt;[[Mark Diesendorf|Diesendorf, Mark]] (2007). ''[[Greenhouse Solutions with Sustainable Energy]]'', UNSW Press, p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt;

Reducing energy use may save consumers money,  if the energy savings offsets the cost of an energy efficient technology.  Reducing energy use reduces emissions.  According to the [[International Energy Agency]], improved energy efficiency in [[Energy efficient buildings|buildings]], industrial processes and [[Sustainable transportation|transportation]] could reduce the world's energy needs in 2050 by one third, and help control global emissions of greenhouse gases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Sophie Hebden |url=http://www.scidev.net/News/index.cfm?fuseaction=readNews&amp;itemid=2929&amp;language=1 |title=Invest in clean technology says IEA report |publisher=Scidev.net |date=2006-06-22 |accessdate=2010-07-16 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926234531/http://www.scidev.net/News/index.cfm?fuseaction=readNews&amp;itemid=2929&amp;language=1 |archivedate=2007-09-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It's been discovered "that for OECD countries, wind, geothermal, hydro and nuclear have the lowest hazard rates among energy sources in production".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ross|first=Cullen|date=26 August 2016|title=Evaluating renewable energy policies|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1467-8489.12175|journal=The Australian Journal of Agricultural and Resource Economics|volume=61 |issue=1|pages=1–18|via=Wiley Online Library}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{See also|Pipeline transport}}

[[Coal]], [[petroleum]] and their derivatives are delivered by boat, [[Rail transport|rail]], or road. Petroleum and natural gas may also be delivered by [[pipeline transport|pipeline]], and coal via a [[Slurry pipeline]]. Fuels such as [[gasoline]] and [[Liquified petroleum gas|LPG]] may also be delivered via [[aircraft]]. Natural gas pipelines must maintain a certain minimum pressure to function correctly. The higher costs of ethanol transportation and storage are often prohibitive.&lt;ref&gt;

=== Wired energy transfer ===

[[File:Electricalgrid.jpg|thumb|[[Electrical grid]] – pylons and cables distribute power]]

{{main|Electrical grid}}

Electricity grids are the [[electrical network|networks]] used to [[Electric power transmission|transmit]] and [[Electricity distribution|distribute]] [[electric power|power]] from production source to end user, when the two may be hundreds of kilometres away.  Sources include electrical generation plants such as a [[nuclear reactor]], coal burning power plant, etc.  A combination of sub-stations and transmission lines are used to maintain a constant flow of electricity. Grids may suffer from transient [[Power blackout|blackouts]] and [[power outage|brownouts]], often due to weather damage. During certain extreme [[space weather]] events [[solar wind]] can interfere with transmissions. Grids also have a predefined [[carrying capacity]] or load that cannot safely be exceeded. When power requirements exceed what's available, failures are inevitable. To prevent problems, power is then rationed.

Industrialised countries such as Canada, the [[United States|US]], and Australia are among the highest per capita consumers of electricity in the world, which is possible thanks to a widespread electrical distribution network. The US grid is one of the most advanced, although [[infrastructure]] maintenance is becoming a problem. [https://web.archive.org/web/20041014214845/http://currentenergy.lbl.gov/ CurrentEnergy] provides a realtime overview of the electricity supply and demand for [[California]], [[Texas]], and the Northeast of the US. African countries with small scale electrical grids have a correspondingly low annual per capita usage of electricity. One of the most powerful power grids in the world supplies power to the state of [[Queensland]], Australia.

=== Wireless energy transfer ===

[[Wireless power transfer]] is a process whereby electrical energy is transmitted from a power source to an electrical load that does not have a built-in power source, without the use of interconnecting wires. Currently available technology is limited to short distances and relatively low power level.

Orbiting solar power collectors would require wireless transmission of power to Earth. The proposed method involves creating a large beam of microwave-frequency radio waves, which would be aimed at a collector antenna site on the Earth. Formidable technical challenges exist to ensure the safety and profitability of such a scheme.

== Storage ==

[[File:Stwlan.dam.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Ffestiniog Power Station]] in [[Wales]], United Kingdom. [[Pumped-storage hydroelectricity]] (PSH) is used for [[grid energy storage]].]]

{{Main|Energy storage|List of energy storage projects}}

Energy storage is accomplished by devices or physical media that store [[energy]] to perform useful operation at a later time. A device that stores energy is sometimes called an [[Accumulator (energy)|accumulator]].

All forms of energy are either [[potential energy]] (e.g. [[Chemical energy|Chemical]], [[gravitation]]al, [[Electric potential energy|electrical energy]], temperature differential, [[latent heat]], etc.) or [[kinetic energy]] (e.g. [[momentum]]). Some technologies provide only short-term energy storage, and others can be very long-term such as [[power to gas]] using [[hydrogen]] or [[methane]] and the [[Seasonal thermal energy storage|storage of heat or cold between opposing seasons]] in deep aquifers or bedrock.  A wind-up clock stores potential energy (in this case mechanical, in the spring tension), a [[Battery (electricity)|battery]] stores readily convertible chemical energy to operate a mobile phone, and a [[Hydroelectricity|hydroelectric]] dam stores [[Electrical power industry|energy]] in a [[reservoir]] as gravitational [[potential energy]]. [[Thermal energy storage#Air conditioning|Ice storage]] tanks store ice ([[thermal energy]] in the form of latent heat) at night to meet peak demand for cooling. [[Fossil fuel]]s such as coal and gasoline store ancient energy derived from sunlight by organisms that later died, became buried and over time were then converted into these fuels. Even [[food]] (which is made by the same process as fossil fuels) is a form of energy stored in [[chemical]] form.

== History ==

[[File:Doel Kerncentrale.JPG|thumb|right|Energy generators past and present at [[Doel]], Belgium: 17th-century windmill ''Scheldemolen'' and 20th-century [[Doel Nuclear Power Station]]]]

Since prehistory, when humanity discovered fire to warm up and roast food, through the Middle Ages in which populations built windmills to grind the wheat, until the modern era in which nations can get electricity splitting the atom. Man has sought endlessly for energy sources.

Except nuclear, geothermal and [[tidal power|tidal]], all other energy sources are from current solar isolation or from fossil remains of plant and animal life that relied upon sunlight. Ultimately, [[solar power|solar energy]] itself is the result of the [[Sun]]'s nuclear fusion. [[Geothermal power]] from hot, hardened [[Rock (geology)|rock]] above the [[magma]] of the Earth's core is the result of the decay of radioactive materials present beneath the Earth's crust, and [[nuclear fission]] relies on man-made fission of heavy radioactive elements in the Earth's crust; in both cases these elements were produced in [[supernova]] explosions before the formation of the [[solar system]].

Since the beginning of the [[Industrial Revolution]], the question of the future of energy supplies has been of interest. In 1865, [[William Stanley Jevons]] published ''The Coal Question'' in which he saw that the reserves of coal were being depleted and that oil was an ineffective replacement. In 1914, [[United States Bureau of Mines|U.S. Bureau of Mines]] stated that the total production was {{convert|5.7|Goilbbl|m3}}. In 1956, Geophysicist [[M. King Hubbert]] deduces that U.S. oil production would [[Hubbert peak theory|peak]] between 1965 and 1970 and that oil production will peak "within half a century" on the basis of 1956 data. In 1989, predicted peak by [[Colin Campbell (geologist)|Colin Campbell]]&lt;ref&gt;"Oil Price Leap in the Early Nineties," Noroil, December 1989, pages 35–38.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, OPEC estimated, with substantial investments, it would nearly double oil output by 2025&lt;ref&gt;Opec Oil Outlook to 2025 Table 4, Page 12&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sustainability ===

[[File:Energy-consumption-World2.png|thumb|right|400px|Energy consumption from 1989 to 1999]]

{{see also|Climate change mitigation|Carbon pricing}}

The [[environmental movement]] has emphasized [[sustainability]] of energy use and development.&lt;ref&gt;Sustainable Development and Innovation in the Energy Sector. Ulrich Steger, Wouter Achterberg, Kornelis Blok, Henning Bode, Walter Frenz, Corinna Gather, Gerd Hanekamp, Dieter Imboden, Matthias Jahnke, Michael Kost, Rudi Kurz, Hans G. Nutzinger, Thomas Ziesemer. Springer, December 5, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Renewable energy]] is sustainable in its production; the available supply will not be diminished for the foreseeable future - millions or billions of years.  "Sustainability" also refers to the ability of the environment to cope with waste products, especially [[air pollution]].  Sources which have no direct waste products (such as wind, solar, and hydropower) are brought up on this point. With global demand for energy growing, the need to adopt various energy sources is growing. [[Energy conservation]] is an alternative or complementary process to energy development.  It reduces the demand for energy by using it efficiently.

Some observers contend that idea of "energy independence" is an unrealistic and opaque concept.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.deloitte.com/assets/Dcom-UnitedStates/Local%20Assets/Documents/Federal/us_fed_Election_Series_101012.pdf  |title=Energy independence and security: A reality check|author=|date=|website=deloitte.com|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130405230251/http://www.deloitte.com/assets/Dcom-UnitedStates/Local%20Assets/Documents/Federal/us_fed_Election_Series_101012.pdf  |archivedate=April 5, 2013 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The alternative offer of "energy resilience" is a goal aligned with economic, security, and energy realities. The notion of resilience in energy was detailed in the 1982 book ''[[Brittle Power]]: Energy Strategy for National Security''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.natcapsolutions.org/publications_files/brittlepower.htm Brittle Power: Energy Plan for National Security] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090702233352/http://www.natcapsolutions.org/publications_files/brittlepower.htm |date=2009-07-02 }}. [[Amory B. Lovins]] and L. Hunter Lovins (1982).&lt;/ref&gt; The authors argued that simply switching to domestic energy would not be secure inherently because the true weakness is the interdependent and vulnerable energy infrastructure of the United States. Key aspects such as gas lines and the electrical power grid are centralized and easily susceptible to disruption. They conclude that a "resilient energy supply" is necessary for both national security and the environment. They recommend a focus on energy efficiency and renewable energy that is decentralized.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.natcapsolutions.org/publications_files/FragileDomEnergy_AtlanticMonthly_Nov1983.pdf "The Fragility of Domestic Energy."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090106001526/http://www.natcapsolutions.org/publications_files/FragileDomEnergy_AtlanticMonthly_Nov1983.pdf |date=2009-01-06 }} [[Amory B. Lovins]] and L. Hunter Lovins. ''Atlantic Monthly''. November 1983.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, former [[Intel Corporation]] Chairman and CEO [[Andrew Grove]] looked to energy resilience, arguing that complete independence is unfeasible given the global market for energy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.american.com/archive/2008/july-august-magazine-contents/our-electric-future "Our Electric Future."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140825064622/http://www.american.com/archive/2008/july-august-magazine-contents/our-electric-future/ |date=2014-08-25 }} [[Andrew Grove]]. ''The American''. July/August 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; He describes energy resilience as the ability to adjust to interruptions in the supply of energy. To that end, he suggests the U.S. make greater use of electricity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.american.com/archive/2008/july-august-magazine-contents/our-electric-future|title=An Electric Plan for Energy Resilience|author=[[Andrew Grove]] and Robert Burgelman|publisher=McKinsey Quarterly|date=December 2008|accessdate=2010-07-20|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140825064622/http://www.american.com/archive/2008/july-august-magazine-contents/our-electric-future/|archivedate=2014-08-25|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Electricity can be produced from a variety of sources. A diverse energy supply will be less affected by the disruption in supply of any one source. He reasons that another feature of electrification is that electricity is "sticky" – meaning the electricity produced in the U.S. is to stay there because it cannot be transported overseas.  According to Grove, a key aspect of advancing electrification and energy resilience will be converting the U.S. automotive fleet from gasoline-powered to electric-powered. This, in turn, will require the modernization and expansion of the electrical power grid. As organizations such as [[The Reform Institute]] have pointed out, advancements associated with the developing [[smart grid]] would facilitate the ability of the grid to absorb vehicles ''en masse'' connecting to it to charge their batteries.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.policyarchive.org/bitstream/handle/10207/16484/Electric_Car_Reform_Brief_FINAL_PDF_3-4-09.pdf?sequence=1 Resilience in Energy: Building Infrastructure Today for Tomorrow's Automotive Fuel.

Energy production usually requires an energy investment. Drilling for oil or building a wind power plant requires energy. The fossil fuel resources that are left are often increasingly difficult to extract and convert. They may thus require increasingly higher energy investments. If investment is greater than the value of the energy produced by the resource, it is no longer an effective energy source.  These resources are no longer an energy source but may be exploited for value as raw materials.  New technology may lower the energy investment required to extract and convert the resources, although ultimately basic physics sets limits that cannot be exceeded.

Between 1950 and 1984, as the [[Green Revolution]] transformed [[agriculture]] around the globe, world grain production increased by 250%. The energy for the Green Revolution was provided by [[fossil fuels]] in the form of [[fertilizers]] (natural gas), [[pesticides]] (oil), and [[hydrocarbon]] fueled [[irrigation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.energybulletin.net/281.html|title=Eating Fossil Fuels|work=Resilience|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070611071544/http://www.energybulletin.net/281.html|archivedate=2007-06-11|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The peaking of world hydrocarbon production ([[peak oil]]) may lead to significant changes, and require sustainable methods of production.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.soilassociation.org/peakoil Peak Oil: the threat to our food security] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090714220834/http://www.soilassociation.org/peakoil |date=July 14, 2009 }} retrieved 28 May 2009&lt;/ref&gt; One vision of a sustainable energy future involves all human structures on the earth's surface (i.e., buildings, vehicles and roads) doing [[artificial photosynthesis]] (using sunlight to split water as a source of hydrogen and absorbing carbon dioxide to make fertilizer) efficiently than plants.&lt;ref&gt;Faunce TA, Lubitz W, Rutherford AW, MacFarlane D, Moore, GF, Yang P, Nocera DG, Moore TA, Gregory DH, Fukuzumi S, Yoon KB, Armstrong FA, Wasielewski MR, Styring S. ‘Energy and Environment Case for a Global Project on Artificial Photosynthesis.’ Energy and Environmental Science 2013, 6 (3), 695 - 698 DOI:10.1039/C3EE00063J {{cite web |url=http://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2013/ee/c3ee00063j |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-08-19 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130816015954/http://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2013/ee/c3ee00063j |archivedate=2013-08-16 |df= }} (accessed 13 March 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''getter''' is a deposit of reactive material that is placed inside a [[vacuum]] system, for the purpose of completing and maintaining the vacuum. When gas molecules strike the getter material, they combine with it chemically or by &lt;span class="syllable"&gt;absorp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="last-syllable"&gt;tion&lt;/span&gt;. Thus the getter removes small amounts of gas from the evacuated space.

The getter is usually a coating applied to a surface within the evacuated chamber.

A vacuum is initially created by connecting a closed container to a [[vacuum pump]]. After achieving a vacuum, the container can be sealed, or the vacuum pump can be left running.   Getters are especially important in sealed systems, such as [[vacuum tube]]s, including [[cathode ray tube]]s (CRTs), and [[vacuum insulated panel]]s, which must maintain a vacuum for a long time.  This is because the inner surfaces of the container release absorbed gases for a long time after the vacuum is established.  The getter continually removes this residual gas as it is produced.   Even in systems which are continually evacuated by a vacuum pump, getters are also used to remove residual gas, often to achieve a higher vacuum than the pump could achieve alone.  Although it weighs almost nothing and has no moving parts, a getter is itself a vacuum pump.&lt;ref name="O'Hanlon"&gt;{{cite book

Getters cannot react permanently with [[inert gas]]es, though some getters will adsorb them in a reversible fashion. Also, [[hydrogen]] is usually handled by adsorption rather than reaction.

Small amounts of gas within a vacuum tube will ionize, causing undesired conduction leading to major malfunction.  Small amounts of gas within a vacuum insulated panel can greatly compromise its insulation value. Getters help to maintain the vacuum.

==Types==
To avoid being contaminated by the atmosphere, the getter must be introduced into the vacuum system in an inactive form during assembly, and activated after evacuation. This is usually done by heat.&lt;ref name="Espe"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Espe |first=Werner |author2=Max Knoll |author3=Marshall P. Wilder|title=Getter materials for electron tubes |journal=Electronics |pages=80–86|publisher=McGraw-Hill |date=October 1950 |url=http://www.tubebooks.org/file_downloads/Getter_Material.pdf |issn=0883-4989 |accessdate=21 October 2013}} on Pete Miller's [http://www.tubebooks.org/ Tubebooks] website&lt;/ref&gt; Different types of getter use different ways of doing this:
*''Flashed getter'' – The getter material is held inactive in a reservoir during assembly, then heated and evaporated after initial evacuation, usually by [[induction heating]]. The vaporized getter, usually a volatile metal, instantly reacts with any residual gas, then condenses on the cool walls of the tube in a thin coating, the ''getter spot'' or ''getter mirror'', which continues to absorb gas. This is the most common type, used in low power [[vacuum tube]]s.
*''Non-evaporable getter'' (NEG)&lt;ref name="Jousten"&gt;{{cite book |last=Jousten |first=Karl |title=Handbook of Vacuum Technology |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |year=2008 |pages=463–474 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Gco_ytUu4QYC&amp;pg=PA463 |isbn=3-527-40723-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The getter remains in solid form.
**''Coating getter'' – a coating applied to metal parts of the vacuum system that will be heated during use. Usually a nonvolatile metal powder sintered in a porous coating to the surface of the electrodes of power vacuum tubes, maintained at temperatures of 200° to 1200&amp;nbsp;°C during operation.
**''Bulk getter'' – sheets, strips, wires or sintered pellets of gas absorbing metals which are heated, either by mounting them on hot components or by a separate heating element. These can often be renewed or replaced
**''Getter pump'' or ''sorption pump'' – In laboratory vacuum systems the bulk NEG getter is often held in a separate vessel with its own heater, attached to the vacuum system by a valve, so that it can be replaced or renewed when saturated.&lt;ref name="Jousten" /&gt;
***''Ion getter pump'' – Uses a high voltage electrode to [[ionize]] the gas molecules and drive them into the getter surface. These can achieve very low pressures and are important in [[ultrahigh vacuum]] (UHV) systems.&lt;ref name="Jousten" /&gt;

==Flashed getters==
[[File:Opachki dead vacuum luminescent display bednyaga da.JPG|thumb|right|Dead [[vacuum fluorescent display]] (air has leaked in and getter spot became white)]]
Flashed getters are prepared by arranging a reservoir of volatile and reactive material inside the vacuum system. Once the system is evacuated and sealed, the material is heated (usually by radio frequency [[induction heating]]). After evaporating, it is deposited as a coating on the interior surfaces of the system. Flashed getters (typically made with [[barium]]) are commonly used in [[vacuum tube]]s. The getter will usually be seen as a silvery metallic spot on the inside of the tube's glass envelope. Large transmission tubes and specialty systems often use more exotic getters, including [[aluminium]], [[magnesium]], [[calcium]], [[sodium]], [[strontium]], [[caesium]] and [[phosphorus]].

If the getter is exposed to atmospheric air (for example, if the tube breaks or develops a leak), it turns white and becomes useless. For this reason, flashed getters are only used in [[hermetic seal|sealed systems]]. A functioning phosphorus getter looks very much like an oxidised metal getter, although it has an [[iridescent]] pink or orange appearance which oxidised metal getters lack. Phosphorus was frequently used before metallic getters were developed.

In systems which need to be opened to air for maintenance, a [[titanium sublimation pump]] provides similar functionality to flashed getters, but can be flashed repeatedly. Alternatively, nonevaporable getters may be used.

Those unfamiliar with sealed vacuum devices, such as [[vacuum tubes]]/thermionic valves, [[high pressure sodium lamp]]s or some types of [[metal-halide lamp]]s, are often mistaken into thinking the flash getter deposit is caused as a result of the failure of the device. Note that contemporary high intensity discharge lamps tend to use non-evaporable getters rather than flash getters.

Those familiar with such devices can often make qualitative assessments as to the hardness or quality of the vacuum within by the appearance of the flash getter deposit, a shiny deposit indicating a good vacuum. As the getter is used, the deposit often becomes thin and translucent particularly at the edges. It can take on a brownish-red semi translucent appearance and this indicates poor seals or extensive use of the device at elevated temperatures. A white deposit, usually of barium oxide indicates total failure of the seal on the vacuum system. as depicted in the fluorescent display module depicted above.

===Activation===
The typical flashed getter used in small vacuum tubes ''(seen in 12AX7 tube, top)'' consists of a ring shaped structure made from a long strip of nickel, bent up into a long, narrow trough and then folded into the ring shape with the trough opening facing upwards in the specific case depicted above. The trough is filled with a mixture of [[barium azide]] and powdered glass.

During activation, whilst the bulb is still on the pump, an R.F. [[induction heating]] coil connected to a powerful [[electronic oscillator|R.F. oscillator]] operating in the 27&amp;nbsp;MHz or 40.68 MHz [[ISM band]] is positioned around the bulb in the plane of the ring. The coil acts as the primary of a transformer and the ring as a single shorted turn. Large R. F. currents flow in the ring, heating it. The coil is moved along the axis of the bulb so as not to overheat and melt the ring. Once the ring is heated the barium azide decomposes into barium vapor and nitrogen. The nitrogen is pumped out and the barium condenses on the bulb above the plane of the ring forming a mirror like deposit with a large surface area. The powdered glass in the ring melts and entraps any particles which could otherwise escape loose inside the bulb causing later problems. The barium combines with any free gas when activated and continues to act after the bulb is sealed off from the pump. During use, the internal electrodes and other parts of the tube get hot. This can cause adsorbed gases to be released from metallic parts, such as anodes (plates), grids or non metallic—but porous—parts, such as sintered ceramic parts. The gas is trapped on the large area of reactive barium on the bulb wall and removed from the tube.

==Non-evaporable getters==
{{main|Non-Evaporable Getter}}
''Non-evaporable getters'' which work at high temperature generally consist of a film of a special alloy, often primarily [[zirconium]]; the requirement is that the alloy materials must form a passivation layer at room temperature which disappears when heated.
Common alloys have names of the form St (Stabil) followed by a number:
*St 707 is 70% [[zirconium]], 24.6% [[vanadium]] and the balance [[iron]],
*St 787 is 80.8% [[zirconium]], 14.2% [[cobalt]] and balance [[mischmetal]],
*St 101 is 84% [[zirconium]] and 16% [[aluminium]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.patentstorm.us/patents/5961750-description.html Nonevaporable getter alloys - US Patent 5961750]&lt;/ref&gt;
In tubes used in electronics, the getter material coats plates within the tube which are heated in normal operation; when getters are used within more general vacuum systems, such as in [[semiconductor manufacturing]], they are introduced as separate pieces of equipment in the vacuum chamber, and turned on when needed.
Deposited and patterned getter material is being used in microelectronics packaging to provide an ultra-high vacuum in a sealed cavity, To enhance the getter pumping capacity, the activation temperature must be maximized, considering the process limitations  &lt;ref&gt;[https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8064729/ High-Q MEMS gyroscope]&lt;/ref&gt;. It is, of course, important not to heat the getter when the system is not already in a good vacuum.

==Education==
Following the end of the war, he enrolled at the [[University of Tartu]] in 1920; graduating with a [[master's degree]] in chemistry in 1925 with the thesis ''Investigation of Alkyl Carbonate Constants''. Kalviste was a founding member of Students' Society Raimla (''Üliõpilaste Selts Raimla'', or ''ÜS Raimla'').&lt;ref name="Raimla" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Students"&gt;[https://yellow.place/en/%C3%BCli%C3%B5pilaste-selts-raimla-tartu-estonia Yellow Place.

Fluent in several languages, Jaan Kalviste translated mathematician [[Henri Poincaré]]'s 1902 book ''[[Science and Hypothesis]]'' from [[French language|French]] into [[Estonian language|Estonian]] (''Teadus ja hüpotees'') in 1936.&lt;ref name="Masson"&gt;[https://erb.nlib.ee/?kid=12307178 Eesti rahvusbibliograafia] ''Kalviste, Jaan, 1898-1936, tõlkija'' (in [[Estonian language|Estonian]]). Retrieved 3 October 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
On  15 June 1936, Jaan Kalviste was part of a group of approximately ten chemists at a seminar organized at the laboratory of the [[Männiku, Tallinn|Männiku]] military ammunition stores in the Tallinn district of [[Nõmme]] when a massive explosion occurred, destroying the entire site and starting a blaze in the nearby heath and pine forest. Kalviste was among the 63 individuals killed in the explosion; the cause of which has, to date, never been fully determined. He was 38-years-old.&lt;ref name="Männiku"&gt;[http://kultuur.elu.ee/ke493_suurpauk.htm Kultuur ja Elu] ''Õnnetused või erioperatsioonid?

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2165">The '''Johannesburg Declaration on Sustainable Development'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.un-documents.net/jburgdec.htm Johannesburg Declaration on Sustainable Development], A/CONF.199/20, Chapter 1, Resolution 1, Johannesburg, September 2002&lt;/ref&gt; was adopted at the [[World Summit on Sustainable Development]] (WSSD), sometimes referred to as '''Earth Summit 2002''', at which the '''Plan of Implementation of the World Summit on Sustainable Development'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.un-documents.net/jburgpln.htm Plan of Implementation of the World Summit on Sustainable Development], A/CONF.199/20, Chapter 1, Resolution 2, Johannesburg, September 2002&lt;/ref&gt; was also agreed upon.

The Johannesburg Declaration builds on earlier declarations made at the [[United Nations Conference on the Human Environment]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.un-documents.net/unchedec.htm Declaration of the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment], A/CONF.48/14/Rev.1, Chapter I, Stockholm, June 1972&lt;/ref&gt; at [[Stockholm]] in 1972, and the [[Earth Summit]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.un-documents.net/rio-dec.htm Rio Declaration on Environment and Development], A/CONF.151/26 (Vol. I), Chapter I, Annex I, Rio de Janeiro, June 1992&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Rio de Janeiro]] in 1992. While committing the nations of the world to [[sustainable development]], it also includes substantial mention of multilateralism as the path forward.

In terms of the political commitment of parties, the Declaration is a more general statement than the Rio Declaration.  It is an agreement to focus particularly on "the worldwide conditions that pose severe threats to the sustainable development of our people, which include: chronic hunger; malnutrition; foreign occupation; armed conflict; illicit drug problems; organized crime; corruption; natural disasters; illicit arms trafficking; trafficking in persons; terrorism; intolerance and incitement to racial, ethnic, religious and other hatreds; xenophobia; and endemic, communicable and chronic diseases, in particular HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis." Johannesburg Declaration 19.

'''Kurakhove Power Station''' (also: '''Kurakhivska TES''' or '''Kurakhovskaya TES''', {{lang-uk|Курахівська ТЕС}}) is a thermal power plant on Volycha river {{convert|15|km}} from [[Kurakhove]] in [[Donetsk Oblast]], [[Ukraine]].

The first Kurakhove power station went into service on July 6, 1941, but was soon rendered inoperable by [[Nazi Germany|German]] troops during [[World War II]].  On October 20, 1941 it was occupied by German troops, who destroyed it in their retraction in 1943. It was repaired soon thereafter and on August 12, 1946 it went into operation again. Further units were installed resulting in an output power of 400&amp;nbsp;MW. Between 1972 and 1975 7&amp;nbsp;new units, one with 200&amp;nbsp;MW, 6 with 210&amp;nbsp;MW went in service, which replaced the old one and which are after modernization in 2006 still in use. The chimney of the power plant is {{convert|250|m}} tall.

== 330 kV-Line Donbass-Dnepr ==
Kurakhovka power station is startpoint of a 330 kV-double-circuit power line of unusual design to Zaporozhye. The 330 kV-Line Donbass-Dnepr is a double-circuit 330 kV three-phase AC [[Overhead power line|power line]] connecting the 330 kV-substation DD-330 in Zaporozhye with Kurakhove Power Station. The line, which was built in 1964, consists in most parts of its length of three parallel power lines, each consisting of pylons with two conductors. Hereby one three-phase AC system consists of the outermost power line and the conductor of the innermost power line, which is closest to it.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2613">A '''leader''' is a hot, highly conductive channel of [[plasma (physics)|plasma]] that plays a critical part during [[dielectric breakdown]] within a long [[electric spark]].

==Mechanism==
When a gas is subjected to [[high voltage]] stress, the [[electric field]] is often quite non-uniform near one, or both, of the high voltage electrodes making up a [[spark gap]]. Breakdown initially begins with the formation of [[corona discharge]]s near the electrode with the highest electrical stress. If the electrical field is further increased, longer length ''cold'' discharges (called ''[[Streamer discharge|streamers]]'' or ''burst corona'') sporadically form near the stressed electrode. Streamers attract multiple [[electron avalanche]]s into a single channel, propagating forward quickly via photon emission which leads to photoelectrons producing new avalanches. Streamers redistribute charge within the surrounding gas, temporarily forming regions of excess charge ([[space charge|space charges]]) in the regions surrounding the discharges.

If the electrical field is sufficiently high, the individual currents from multitudes of streamers combine to create a hot, highly conductive path that projects from the electrode, going some distance into the gap. The projecting channel of hot plasma is called a leader, and it can have an electrical conductivity approaching that of an [[electric arc]]. The leader effectively ''projects'' the electrical field from the nearby electrode further into the gap, similar to introducing a short length of wire into the gap. The tip of the conductive leader now forms a new region from which streamers can entend even further into the gap. As new streamer discharges feed the tip of the leader, the streamer currents help to keep the leader hot and conductive. Under sufficiently high voltages, the leader will continue to extend itself further into the gap, doing so in a series of jumps until the entire gap has been bridged. Although leaders are most often associated with the initial formative stages of a [[lightning]] stroke, they are characteristic of the development of all long sparks. In the case of a lightning leader, each extension (called a [[step leader]]) is typically 10 – 50 meters in length. The branching, visible blue-white discharges from a [[Tesla Coil]] are also examples of leaders.

[[File:MIS-Kondensator (vertikal).svg|thumb|MIS structure (Metal / SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; / ''p''-Si) in a vertical MIS capacitor]]
A '''MIS capacitor''' is a capacitor formed from a layer of [[metal]], a layer of [[Electrical insulation|insulating]] material and a layer of [[semiconductor]] material. It gets its name from the initials of the metal-insulator-semiconductor structure. As with the MOS [[field-effect transistor]] structure, for historical reasons, this layer is also often referred to as a MOS capacitor, but this specifically refers to an oxide insulator material.

The maximum capacitance, ''C''&lt;sub&gt;MIS(max)&lt;/sub&gt; is calculated analogously to the plate capacitor:

: &lt;math&gt;C_\mathrm{MIS(max)}=\varepsilon_0\varepsilon_r \cdot { {A} \over {d} }&lt;/math&gt;
where :
*''&amp;epsilon;&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;''  is the insulator's [[relative permittivity]]
*''&amp;epsilon;&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;''  is the [[permittivity]] of the [[vacuum]]
*''A'' is the area
*''d'' is the insulator thickness

The production method depends on materials used (it is even possible that polymers can be used as the insulator). We will consider an example of a MOS capacitor based on [[silicon]] and [[silicon dioxide]]. On the semiconductor substrate, a thin layer of oxide (silicon dioxide) is applied (by, for example, [[thermal oxidation]], or [[chemical vapour deposition]]) and then [[Evaporation (deposition)|coated]] with a metal.

This structure and thus a capacitor of this type is present in every MIS field-effect transistor, such as [[MOSFET]]s. For the steady reduction of the size of structures in microelectronics, the following facts are clear. From the formula above it follows that capacitance increases with ever thinner layers of insulation. For all MIS devices the insulation thickness cannot fall below a minimum of around 10&amp;nbsp;nm. Using thinner insulation than this leads to the occurrence of [[quantum tunnelling|tunneling]] through the insulating material (dielectric). Due to this, the use of so-called [[High-k dielectric|high-k]] materials as the insulator material is being investigated (as of 2009).

'''MT ''Independența''''' ("''Independence''") was a large Romanian crude oil carrier. She collided in 1979 with a Greek freighter at the southern entrance of [[Bosphorus]], Turkey, and exploded. She caught fire and grounded. Almost all of the tanker's crew members died. The wreck of the ''Independența'' burned for weeks, causing heavy air and sea pollution in the [[Istanbul]] area and the [[Sea of Marmara]].

==Ship==
MT ''Independența'' was a 1978–built Romanian-flagged [[oil tanker|crude oil carrier]], the biggest ship of her country's commercial fleet at that time. She was {{convert|283|m|ftin|abbr=on}} long, had a beam of {{convert|46|m|ftin|abbr=on}} and a depth of {{convert|22|m|ftin|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="dh"/&gt;

==Loss==

By mid November 1979, the ''Independența'', carrying 94,000 tons (714,760 [[Barrel (volume)|barrels]]) of crude oil from Es Sider, Libya to [[Constanța]], Romania dropped anchor about 4&amp;nbsp;nautical miles off the Haydarpaşa Breakwater at the southern entrance of the [[Bosphorus|Istanbul Strait]]. She was waiting for a [[maritime pilot]] for the guidance of her 19th passage through the strait. The Greek cargo ship [[M/V Evriali|M/V ''Evriali'']] (10,000 DWT) was transporting 7,400 tons steel from [[Mariupol]], Ukraine (formerly Zhdanov) to Italy, and had already passed the strait southwards.&lt;ref name="dh"/&gt;

Early in the morning of 15 November at 04:35, Evriali collided with Independenta hitting the Romanian ship between the number 3 and 4 tanks, on the starboard side. The Turkish pilot that helped Evriali navigate the strait, Dincer Sumerkan, got off the Greek ship earlier, instructing them to follow a course at 260 degrees right, however the Greek cargo ship took a course of 160 degrees left.

The sparks from the collision at 04:35 caused a big explosion on Independenta followed 3 minutes later by another explosion. A third explosion occurred at 04:47. The ''Independența'' ran aground half a mile off the [[Port of Haydarpaşa]]. 43 members of the tanker's crew lost their lives; only 3 survived the catastrophic accident. Almost all the victims lost their lives in the water when burning oil on the surface was driven towards the shore by the wind; the sailors who survived had jumped on the other side of the ship, against the wind, being later rescued by boats.&lt;ref name="dh"/&gt;&lt;ref name="st"/&gt;&lt;ref name="m1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="un"/&gt;

The [[Turkish Navy]] immediately attempted to extinguish the fire. However, these efforts had to be abandoned due to the intensity of the fire. The Director of the Sea of Marmara District took over the spill on 19 November, and the Navy withdrew.

The Greek captain of the Evriali,  Alekos Adamopulos (29 years old at that time), was sentenced to 20 months in jail. The difference of time between his arrest and the 20 months, was converted into an $850 fine.

The Istanbul Strait remained closed for weeks. The wreck affected the area for some years until it was broken up and salvaged to a shipyard in [[Tuzla (district)|Tuzla]].&lt;ref name="st"/&gt;

==Investigations==
The exact cause of accident is not clear, even today. The Romanian shipping company "Navrom" claimed the insurance payout, amounting to some tens of millions of US dollars. This action resulted in a thorough inspection of the ship's wreck by independent survey teams employed by the insurance company from [[Lloyd's Register of Shipping]], Japan. It is hinted that it was an inside job so that they could acquire more money.

==Trial==
After the accident, the court charged the captain of the Greek ship, Alekos Adamopoulos, and the seven crew with being careless and negligent, disobeying international maritime regulations and jeopardizing security of Istanbul. He was sentenced to 20 months in prison, but was released in respect to his 7-months jail during the trial.&lt;ref name="dh"/&gt;

==Pollution==
From 17 to 27 November, there was slight leakage from the tanker. Another major explosion occurred on board the vessel on the night of 6 December at 10:40&amp;nbsp;p.m., which resulted in more oil spillage.&lt;ref name="st"/&gt; The slick from the vessel drifted towards the Port of Haydarpaşa, and the booms across its entrance could not prevent approximately 50 tons of oil entering the harbor. The tanker continued to burn until 14 December.&lt;ref name="dh"/&gt;

The maximum accumulation of harmful particles in the air during the fire exceeded by four times the permissible limit set for human health. Heavy oil contamination formed on the surface of the sea and on the heavily built-up shores and the recreational beaches of the [[Sea of Marmara]] and the Istanbul Strait.&lt;ref name="dh"/&gt;&lt;ref name="un"/&gt;

It was estimated that 30,000 tons of crude oil burned and that the remaining 64,000 tons spilled into the sea. Because of the rapid evaporation of the light components, the crude oil quickly sank to the bottom of the sea in an area approximately 5.5&amp;nbsp;km in diameter.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tudav.org/bogaz_veri_bank.htm Strait Data Bank at Turkish Maritime Research Foundation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070831155705/http://www.tudav.org/bogaz_veri_bank.htm |date=31 August 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sister ships==
M/T ''Independența'' was the first of a series of five Romanian supertankers which were constructed by Santierul Naval Constanța in the 1980s. The sister ships were as follows:

[[MT Unirea|M/T ''Unirea'']] (Union) – broke up and sank at the beginning of the 1980s in Bulgarian waters of the [[Black Sea]]. Official reports claim that the accident was caused by a collision with a [[World War II]] mine. A different opinion (unofficial) came from some naval architects and marine engineers stating that the ship broke up due to incorrect ballasting (the ship had no cargo at the moment of the accident).

[[Biruința (ship)|M/T ''Biruința'']] (Victory) – owned and managed by the then Romanian state owned Shipping Company (Navrom). In the 1990s the ship was passed to the Romanian private shipping company "Petromin", changing its name to M/T ''Iris Star''. Finally the ship was bought by the Romanian shipping company Histria Shipmanagement having its name changed again to M/T ''Histria Crown''. After an extensive refit in Keppel Shipyard (Singapore) finished in 2009, the ship was converted in  into a FPSO (Floating production storage and offloading) and given a new name, Armada Perdana. It is still in use of the coast of Nigeria (Oyo Oil Field) as of 2018.

'''M/T ''Libertatea''''' (Liberty) – had the same history (including ownership) as her older sister M/T ''Biruinta''. The ship, known then as M/T ''Histria Prestige'', was broken up in 2005.

'''M/T ''Pacea''''' (Peace) – was never fully completed. At the end of the 1980s it was passed to [[Czechoslovakia]] as a part of Romania's foreign debt.

==Sister ship's incident==
The sister ship of ''Independența'', the [[Biruința (ship)|M/T ''Iris Star'']] lost power due to engine failure during her passage through the Bosphorus on 27 July 2000, and drifted towards Kandilli point. There was no extensive damage reported.

[[File:MarkIV-2.jpg|thumb|[[Mesa Boogie Mark Series#Mark IV|Mesa-Boogie "Mark IV"]], a guitar combo amplifier]]
The '''Mesa Boogie Mark Series''' is a series of [[guitar amplifier]] made by [[Mesa Boogie|Mesa Engineering]] (more commonly known as "Mesa/Boogie"). Originally just referred to as "Boogies," the product line took on the moniker "Mark Series" as newer revisions were put into production. The Mark Series amplifier was Mesa's flagship product until the introduction of the Rectifier series, and the amplifiers are very collectable.

==Mark I==
Randall Smith began Mesa/Boogie with a practical joke: he borrowed a [[Fender Princeton]] (a small 12-watt amplifier) from his friend, [[Barry Melton]] of [[Country Joe and the Fish]], and "hotrodded" it by replacing the amplifier section with a powerful [[Fender Bassman]] amp and installing a 12-inch speaker instead of the original 10-inch. The resulting amplifier proved to be loud and successful, and Smith made more than 200 of these Princeton "Boogies"—a name allegedly provided by [[Carlos Santana]],&lt;ref name="Gallagher"&gt;{{cite book|last=Gallagher|first=Mitch|title=Guitar Tone: Pursuing the Ultimate Guitar Sound|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6XALAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA251|year=2012|publisher=Cengage|isbn=9781435456211|page=251}}&lt;/ref&gt; who is to have exclaimed "Man, that little thing really boogies!"&lt;ref name="Chappell"&gt;{{cite book|last=Chappell|first=Jon|title=Blues Guitar For Dummies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3pXjs_pDa0gC&amp;pg=PA288|year=2011|publisher=John Wiley|isbn=9781118050828|pages=288–89}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A second important improvement was in developing an extra gain stage for the guitar input. Smith added an extra tube gain stage to the preamp, with three variable gain controls at different points in the circuit (this is now called a "cascaded" design), creating the first high-gain amplifier. He set about designing a guitar amplifier around the new principle, and in 1972 the [[Mesa Boogie Mark Series#Mark I|Mark I]] was released.&lt;ref name="Gallagher"/&gt;

One of the more notable amps in the series was built in 1977, with serial number A804: this is the amp built for [[Keith Richards]], the first one in a long collaboration between Smith and the Rolling Stones, a collaboration which started somewhat inauspiciously when the Stones manager asked Smith for some free amps ("We're the Rolling Stones; we don't pay for amps"), and Smith refused. (Richards had played Santana's Boogie and decided he wanted one too.) Finally, Smith talked to Richards and they agreed that he would send them an amp, and that the Stones would pay for it or return it. Richards ended up using the amp for the [[El Mocambo]] show (as one of six), and the Stones, over the years, received and paid for over forty of Smith's amps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hunter|first=Dave|title=Amped: The Illustrated History of the World's Greatest Amplifiers|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kEGlViYnS9MC&amp;pg=PA183|year=2012|publisher=Voyageur|isbn=9780760339725|pages=182–83|chapter=Circa 1977 Mesa/Boogie Mark I}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first Boogies are referred to as Mark I's, though they were not given this name until the Mark II was released. They were 60 or 100 watt combo amps with a 12-inch speaker, primarily Altec-Lansing 417-8H Series II. The Mark I had two channels: The "Input 2" channel, voiced like the [[Fender Bassman]], and the high gain "Input 1" channel, which produced the overdriven "Boogie lead" sound used most notably by Carlos Santana on side 2 of [[Caravanserai (album)|Caravanserai]], and by [[The Rolling Stones]]' [[Keith Richards]] and [[Ron Wood]], who used the amps live and in the studio from 1977 until 1993. Examples of this amp in its original form and in good condition are sought after by collectors and guitar aficionados. [[Reverb#Spring reverberators|Reverb]] was optional, and not present on many early Boogies. Later, Mark I models were available with reverb and/or [[Graphic Equilizer#Graphic equalizer|graphic EQ]].

===S.O.B. (Son of Boogie)===
The S.O.B. was introduced in the Mark II era. This was Mesa/Boogie's first attempt at having a reissue of the Mark I. It had two cascading gain inputs and its controls were Volume(gain) 1, Volume(gain) 2, Master, High, Middle, Low, Limit or Presence (depending on the version). No foot-switching available, however an A/B splitter pedal could be used to select input 1 or input 2 separately. There was also a reverb option which replaced the Middle knob with the reverb control knob. These amps had a point-to-point wired power section and had large transformers with great headroom, even in 50 watt trim. SOB chassis were shared with other heads, but had different front and rear plates. EQ, slider cutouts and other 1/4" jack cutouts can be seen from inside the chassis.

==Mark II==

===Mark IIA===
The Mark II introduced channel footswitching. It was not referred to as the "Mark IIA" until the Mark IIB was issued. It was also available as a head (a standalone amplifier), which could be hooked up to a number of different speaker combinations, although a 1x12" cabinet was the most common. The preamp gain on the Mark IIs occurs after the tone controls and so, according to Mesa/Boogie, the IIA has a "tighter, more focused sound" than the Mark I.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} The Mark IIA's control panel was extended from the Mark I's to include a separate master volume control for the lead mode, and various push/pull switches including Pull Bright, Pull Treble Shift, Pull Gain Boost, a separate Pull Bright for the lead mode, and of course, Pull Lead. The 1/4" jack previously marked "1" was changed to just "Input," and "2" was changed to "Foot Switch." The Mark IIA was a great improvement over the Mark I, however it had a few major flaws that it received criticism for among collectors. The new footswitching system relied on a relay, which made an audible popping noise when switching modes. The reverb circuit was also noise-ridden on some models. The IIA and IIB, and some late-model Mark I amps, used a JFET-based device called [[fetron]] in place of the input stage 12AX7 (V1), and included a switch for configuring the amp for either Fetron or 12AX7 operation. The reason for using a fetron was to address some of the problems associated with microphonic 12AX7 tubes in a high-gain situation; its use was later discontinued as newer production tubes were able to withstand the extreme conditions within the amplifier.

===Mark IIB===
The Mark IIB is credited as the first guitar amplifier with a tube-buffered effects loop. However, the loop was placed between two critical gain stages, and tended to overdrive some instrument level effects, and also caused volume pedals to act as remote gain controls for the lead mode. Mesa later implemented a mod that caused the effects loop to become more transparent, and smoothed out the lead channel, similar to the IIC+'s lead channel. More importantly, it marked the introduction of Mesa/Boogie's "Simul-Class" system, where two of the power tubes (always 6L6s) run in [[Class AB amplifier#Class B and AB|class AB]] [[pentode]] while the other two tubes (either 6L6s or EL34s) run in class A [[triode]]. In a simul-class amp, running all four tubes generates approximately 75 watts RMS of power; running only the class A tubes produces about 15 watts. Also available were non-simul-class Mark IIBs in both a 60 watt version and a 100 watt version that allowed shifting down to 60 watts by turning off a pair of power tubes.

The Mark IIB's front control panel is identical to that of the IIA. The two input jacks on the front panel are marked "Input" and "Foot Switch." The front panels read Volume, Treble, Bass, Middle, Master, Lead Drive and Master. It has "Pull Bright" on the Volume, "Pull Shift" on the Treble, and "Pull Bright" on the Master. The Rear control panel was altered to accommodate the FX Send and Return jacks.

===Mark IIC &amp; IIC+===
The Mark IIC finally remedied the two major problems of the IIA and the IIB: the previously noisy reverb circuit and a footswitching system that produced a popping noise when activated. The Mark IIC featured a quieter footswitching system based on optocouplers to reroute the signal, and a new mod to the reverb circuit. The reverb modification involved resistor swaps and a change in ground lead placement. That mod[ification] is still on the books of 'official' mods, which they send to their authorized techs; it runs about $50."{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} Mesa/Boogie no longer does this modification at its own factory. The Mark IIC also featured a new Pull Bass shift on the front panel, which slightly extended the low frequencies in the preamp.

The Mark IIC+ was the last of the Mark II series and featured a more sensitive lead channel - due to its featuring a dual cascading drive stage - whereas the IIA and IIB had a single-stage drive circuit.  The IIC+ also had an improved effects loop. Unlike earlier Mark II models, pedals configured for instrument-level input signal could be used without the amp's signal overloading their inputs. However, the volume pedal option on the Mark IIB cannot be implemented on Mark IIC+s.

Some owners/dealers/sellers say the "+" refers to an amp having an EQ, but they are mistaken. The mistake may have originated in the mid 1980s, when Mesa/Boogie issued their Studio .22 model and then changed the name to Studio .22+, which featured improved wiring, etc. All the Mark II models could be made with EQ as an option, but not all of them did. A Mark IIC+ could, for example, refer to a 100 watt amp without EQ or reverb.

One can tell if a particular amp is a "+" by looking for a hand-written black "+" mark directly above where the power cord attaches to the back of the amp. Many dealers increase the price on a Mark IIC+ but often don't know anything about what the "+" means - they often don't even know where to find the "+" mark. Indeed, the mark itself can be forged. An owner can call Mesa/Boogie and ask them to check his or her serial number against their records. Mesa/Boogie only made about 1,400 Mark IIC amps before moving to the Mark IIC+.
Another cosmetic way of distinguishing a IIC from a IIC+ is the front panel. A IIC has the traditional "Gain Boost" pull switch integrated into the master volume, while a IIC+ replaced the switch with a Pull Deep bass booster. Some Coliseum series IIC+s retained the surplus "Gain Boost" faceplates, though. IIC+s upgraded from earlier IICs also retain their original Gain Boost faceplates. However, there are some very early "transitional" C+s (in the 133xx range) with gain boost on the panel, but it works the same as the pull Deep on the later versions.

A practical, non-cosmetic method for determining whether a Mark IIC is a C+ is the "Loop Test":&lt;ref&gt;http://forum.grailtone.com/viewtopic.php?f=27&amp;t=18184&lt;/ref&gt;

1) Plug your guitar into the Effects Return jack
2) Switch to lead mode
3) Turn the Lead Drive and Gain controls with a note ringing.
4) If they have NO effect on the volume and sound you have a “+”.

This method should remove all doubt as to whether the preamp circuit board is a IIC or a IIC+.

The Mark IIC+ is currently the most coveted vintage Boogie, selling for twice its original price on average, because of its much praised "Liquid Lead" mode, and also its warm, clean rhythm mode.

==Mark III==
The Mark III was launched by Mesa/Boogie in 1985. It introduced a third channel, a "crunch" rhythm sound right in between the rhythm and lead channels. This amp has a dual footswitch system: one footswitch alternates between the current rhythm mode and the lead mode, and the other selects either the clean rhythm mode or the crunch rhythm mode. The two rhythm modes share all of their controls, while the lead mode only shares the rhythm modes' [[tone stack]], featuring independent gain and master volume controls. The physical switch for the crunch rhythm mode was implemented as a push/pull switch above the Middle frequency control. Most Mark IIIs have presence and reverb on the back (except for long chassis') unless not desired by the buyer; Graphic EQ was also optional all in either head or combo format.

The Mark III went through multiple revisions, similar to the Mark II. Each revision had a slightly different voicing, but identical functionality. Non-Simulclass versions of the Mark III came in either 60w RMS with two 6L6s or 60w/100w with four 6L6s in the power section. Mark IIIs contain either four or five 12AX7 tubes in the pre-amp section, depending on if they have the reverb option. Simul-class Mark IIIs usually contain two 6L6s in the inner sockets and two EL34s in the outer sockets for 15w/75w use.

===Black Stripe (1985)===
These are distinguished by either the absence of a marking, a black dot, or a black marker stripe above the power cord entry. Early Black Stripes retained the same power transformer as the IIC+, which is easily distinguished by its larger physical size than the later-introduced Mark III transformer.

Early Black Stripes also re-used the faceplate from the Mark II series. This resulted in the pull function of the Master 1 knob being mislabelled as Gain Boost instead of the correct Pull Deep name. Furthermore, the pull function labels above the Bass and Middle knobs were hand-etched onto the face plate resulting in a slightly different look than the other labels on the faceplate.

===Purple Stripe (1986)===
The second revision was the "Purple Stripe" Mark III, which featured a purple marker stripe above the power cord. This amplifier was voiced with a more mellow lead and crunch modes, with slightly reduced gain.

===Red Stripe (1987)===
The third revision was the "Red Stripe" Mark III which featured a red marker stripe above the power cord. The amplifier had increased gain over the purple stripe, and lead mode circuitry almost identical to the IIC+.

=== Blue Stripe (1988 – mid 89) ===
The fourth revision was the "Blue Stripe" Mark III which featured a blue marker stripe above the power cord. The amplifier was voiced so brightly, it is considered to be the most aggressive Mark Series Boogie ever introduced. The power amp was also altered to mirror that of the IIC+.

===Green Stripe (1989)===
The final revision was the "Green Stripe" Mark III, which was only available in a Simul-Class format. It was identical to the Blue Stripe, except for the wiring of the Class A power amp tubes, which were switched to Pentode operation instead of Triode for a 10w RMS increase over previous Simul-Class amplifiers (15w/75w) making 25w/85w.
Mesa ultimately ended the Mark III's production in the company's largest marketing failure, since it overlapped with production of its successor, the Mark IV, which was introduced in 1990. Mark IIIs were still in steady production around 1994, and finally ceased as late as 1997, 11 years after its launch.

== Mark IV ==
The Mark IV was launched by Mesa/Boogie in 1990 as a three-channel amp - with independent controls for all three channels, except bass and mid, which are the same for both Rhythm 1 (clean) and Rhythm 2 (crunch). The "crunch" channel is designed for use by hard rock and heavy metal rhythm guitarists. There were two versions of this amp.  Mark IVs built from the start of production until about September 1993 are referred to as version A; amplifiers made from late 1993 until the end of production in 2008 are known as version B. Early Bs have an attached power cord, like the A version. Some differences: version A has no footswitch for reverb or stereo effects loop, and the lead channel is much like the Mark IIC+‘s. Version B has switchable reverb, a single switchable stereo effects loop, and an output to drive another power amp. Its voicings are altered slightly. Both versions are highly regarded; production of the Mark IV ceased in 2008.

== Mark V ==
The Mark V was introduced in early 2009. Much like its close cousin, the Triaxis Preamp, it features many voicings based on previous Mark Series amplifiers. It has three distinct channels, each with their own pre-gain three band tone stack, gain, master, and presence controls. Each channel also has three modes, which control several of the amplifier's 49 relays to mirror the circuit being modelled. The Mark V introduced a channel-assignable graphic EQ. Older Boogies were equipped with graphic equalizers, but these did not allow the same flexibility. Each channel has a toggle switch able to select between EQ active, off, or footswitched. Similar to the Express and F-series amplifiers, the graphic EQ also had channel-assignable contour knobs.

The Mark V - like its predecessor - comes standard in a Simul-Class format, but with a twist: early Simul-Class power amps were configured for SC-75 watt operation, or A-15 watt operation, or an increase of 10 watts when in pentode mode. The Mark V is biased warmer to produce an output of SC-90 watts, AB-45 watts, and Single-Ended A-10 watts, similar to the Lone Star. Channel-specific Multi-Watt toggles dictate the power amplifier's operation class.

== Mark 5:25 ==
The Mark 5:25 was introduced in 2014. It is a smaller, two-channel version of the Mark V. The output section contains two EL84 tubes which can be switched between 10 and 25 Watts. It also features a built-in CabClone which can be used to emulate a speaker cabinet while driving headphones for silent playing, or a direct-in (DI) box for recording or sound reinforcement applications.

== Mark 5:35 ==
The Mark 5:35 was introduced in 2015. It is based on the Mark 5:25 and features two channels. The output section contains four EL84 tubes which can be switched between 10, 25, and 35 Watts. Additional solo controls were added for independent volume switching. It is also available as a combo and a head. The combo is a similar size to the Mark I combo.  It also features cab clone.

== JP-2C John Petrucci Signature Head ==
The JP-2C was introduced in 2016. It is a 3-channel 100-watt "revival" of the Mesa Mark IIC+ designed in part with [[Dream Theater]] guitarist [[John Petrucci]], who is well-known for using a Mark IIC+ in the studio. The three channels are based upon the original channels of the Mark IIC+, but with two identical gain channels based on the IIC+'s lead channel. It also features two separate graphic EQs, which can be selected for each channel via mini toggles on each channel's front panel. It is also the first Mesa amp to feature [[MIDI]] connections, which can control the channel switching, as well as controlling the FX loop and graphic EQs. Much like the Mark 5:25, the JP-2C features a built-in CabClone. The amp also features a switch to drop the amp's wattage down to 60 watts for use in smaller venues or recording.

'''Naval museum complex Balaklava''' ({{lang-uk|Морський музейний комплекс "Балаклава"}}, Russian: Музей холодной войны, "The Cold War Museum", designation K-825) is an underground [[submarine]] base in [[Balaklava]], [[Crimea]], {{In Crimea}} (originally known as ''Object 825 GTS''). It was a top-secret military facility during the [[Cold War]], located in [[Balaklava Bay|Balaklava Bay]].

Today it serves as a museum and also houses a museum about the [[Crimean War]].

== Description and purpose ==
The complex is built accordingly to withstand a category-I ([[Nuclear weapon yield|nuclear yield]] of 100kt) nuclear explosion, and includes an underground network of water channels complete with a dry dock, repair shops, warehouses for torpedoes and other weapons.&lt;ref name=Object825GTSSubase&gt;{{cite web|title=Take a Look Inside These Abandoned Submarines &amp; Bases|url=http://www.historyinorbit.com/take-a-look-inside-these-abandoned-submarines-and-bases/24/?src=taboola&amp;v=p&amp;utm_source=taboola&amp;utm_medium=NICK_historyinorbit.com-Desktop-US-SubEA&amp;utm_term=msn-msn&amp;utm_campaign=Lets+Leave+It+Here.+Abandon+Ships+Found+Around+The+World|work=History in Orbit website|author=Ryan|pages=24–26|date=March 15, 2015|access-date=July 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally it could protect personnel from nuclear fallout.&lt;ref name=Object825GTSSubase/&gt; The complex is located in the mountain of Tavros, on both sides of which are exits.&lt;ref name=Object825GTSSubase/&gt; [[Caisson (lock gate)|Caisson gate]]s could be used if necessary to seal the entire complex. An exit to the open sea is provided on the northern side of the mountain. The holes in the rock are neatly covered with camouflage devices and networks.

Object 825 GTS was intended to house, repair and maintain Project 613 and 633(known as [[Whiskey-class submarine|Whiskey]] and [[Romeo-class submarine|Romeo]]-class respectively) submarines.&lt;ref name=Object825GTSSubase/&gt; The central water channel of the facility, at a length 602 meters, could accommodate up to 7 submarines if necessary, and up to 14 submarines of different classes in all water channels. The water channels have depths up to 8 meters, with widths ranging from 12 to 22 meters. The total area of all facilities in the complex is around 9600 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, while the total surface area of water stands at 5200. Equipment loading in peacetime was carried out on the pier, then conducted while watching out for the movements of spy satellites of possible military adversaries. A special tunnel is used for loading equipment into the base in wartime.&lt;ref name=Object825GTSSubase/&gt; The complex also includes a repair and technical base, codenamed Object 280, designed for storing and maintaining nuclear arsenal.&lt;ref name=Object825GTSSubase/&gt; Submarines could enter and exit the base completely submerged through its underwater access point.&lt;ref name=Object825GTSSubase/&gt; Temperature inside the base is kept around 15 degrees Celsius.

The Soviet Navy trained [[dolphins]] at this facility to attach [[Animal-borne bomb attacks|underwater beacons and explosives]] to submarines and ships.&lt;ref name=Object825GTSSubase/&gt;

== History ==
In the period after the Second World War, the two superpowers, the USSR and the US, stepped up their nuclear arsenal, threatening each other with [[Pre-emptive nuclear strike|pre-emptive strikes]] and [[Second strike|retaliatory strikes]]. It was then when [[Joseph Stalin]] gave [[Lavrentiy Beria]] (who was responsible at that time for nuclear projects), a secret directive; to find a place where they could house submarines for a retaliatory nuclear strike. Several years of research pinpointed the quiet Balaklava as the location, and the city was immediately coded and got merged into the city of Sevastopol as a city district. Balaklava sits on a narrow winding inlet with a width of only 200–400 meters. This small inlet protects the city not only from storms, but also from reconnaissance as it is not visible from any angle from the open sea. Additionally, the site is close to [[Sevastopol]], a major naval base still used by the [[Russian Navy|Russian]] Navy's [[Black Sea Fleet]] today.

In 1957 a special construction department coded as No. 528 was created, which handled the construction of underground facilities. The construction of the underground complex lasted eight years, from 1953 to 1961. About 120 thousand tons of rock were removed from the Tavros mountain throughout the process. To ensure secrecy supplies were transported at night on a barge in the open sea. After the complex was closed in 1993, most of the complex is unguarded. The abandoned facility was handed over to the [[Ukrainian Navy|naval forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine]] in 2000.

However, the former base was frequently [[Looting|plundered]] during the unguarded period from 1993 to 2003, with all metal structures scavenged for the metal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://submarine.id.ru/cp/z97.shtml|title=Underground harbor of submarines (Russian)|last=Cherkashin|first=N.|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070516003051/http://www.submarine.id.ru/cp/z97.shtml|archivedate=2007-05-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Sevastopol "Marine Commission" led by Vladimir Stefanovsky proposed the construction of the current museum. The museum would have themed exhibition halls, which were former repair shops and arsenals, a submarine standing by the underground pier, a tourist center, a cinema room with a chronicle of the time of active military confrontation between the two superpowers, and finally, an underground memorial dedicated to submariners who died at sea.{{cn|date=November 2018}}

The 10th anniversary of the museum was celebrated in June 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://meridian.in.ua/news/10624.html|title=Подземный музей отметил юбилей (видео)|website=meridian.in.ua|access-date=2016-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Submarine veterans, former employees of the base as well as representatives from the authorities, armed forces and students attended the ceremony.

The facility was placed under the jurisdiction of Russia and the southern area of the Military History Museum of fortification structures of the Russian Federation in 2014, after the [[Annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation|annexation of Crimea]].&lt;ref&gt;http://muzey-sevastopol.com/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Restoration ==
According to press information from March 2014, Russia is considering the possibility of restoring the submarine base in Balaklava.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.gazeta.ru/science/2014/03/23_a_5956453.shtml|title=Подводные лодки в степях Балаклавы|newspaper=Газета.Ru|access-date=2016-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Address ==
The base sits at No.22 Tavricheskaya Naberezhnaya street, Balaklava district, Sevastopol, Crimea.

The '''neutron''' is a [[subatomic particle]], symbol {{SubatomicParticle|Neutron}} or {{SubatomicParticle|Neutron0}}, with no net [[electric charge]] and a [[mass]] slightly larger than that of a [[proton]]. Protons and neutrons constitute the [[atomic nucleus|nuclei]] of [[atoms]]. Since protons and neutrons behave similarly within the nucleus, and each has a mass of approximately one [[atomic mass unit]], they are both referred to as [[nucleon]]s.&lt;ref name="Nuc"&gt;{{Citation |author1-last= Thomas |author1-first= A.W. |author2-last= Weise |author2-first= W. |title= The Structure of the Nucleon |publisher= Wiley-WCH, Berlin |publication-date= 2001 |isbn= 3-527-40297-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their properties and interactions are described by [[nuclear physics]].

The chemical and nuclear properties of the nucleus are determined by the number of protons, called the [[atomic number]], and the number of neutrons, called the [[neutron number]]. The [[atomic mass number]] is the total number of nucleons. For example, [[carbon]] has atomic number 6, and its abundant [[carbon-12]] isotope has 6 neutrons, whereas its rare [[carbon-13]] isotope has 7 neutrons. Some elements occur in nature with only one [[stable nuclide|stable isotope]], such as [[fluorine]]. Other elements occur with many stable isotopes, such as [[tin]] with ten stable isotopes.

Within the nucleus, protons and neutrons are bound together through the [[nuclear force]]. Neutrons are required for the stability of nuclei, with the exception of the single-proton [[hydrogen]] atom. Neutrons are produced copiously in [[nuclear fission]] and [[nuclear fusion|fusion]]. They are a primary contributor to the [[nucleosynthesis]] of chemical elements within [[star]]s through fission, fusion, and [[neutron capture]] processes.

The neutron is essential to the production of nuclear power. In the decade after the neutron was discovered by [[James Chadwick]] in 1932,&lt;ref name="Chad1932"&gt;

==Description==
{{Nuclear physics}}
[[Atomic nucleus|Atomic nuclei]] are formed by a number of [[proton]]s, Z the [[atomic number]], and a number of neutrons, N the [[neutron number]], bound together by the [[nuclear force]]. The atomic number defines the [[chemical element|chemical properties]] of the atom, and the neutron number determines the [[isotope]] or [[nuclide]].&lt;ref name="ENW"&gt;{{Citation |editor1-last= Glasstone |editor1-first= Samuel |editor2-last= Dolan |editor2-first= Philip J. |title= The Effects of Nuclear Weapons, Third Edition |publisher= U.S. Dept. of Defense and Energy Research and Development Administration, U.S. Government Printing Office |publication-date= 1977 |isbn= 1-60322-016-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; The terms isotope and nuclide are often used [[synonym]]ously, but they refer to chemical and nuclear properties, respectively. Strictly speaking, isotopes are two or more nuclides with the same number of protons; nuclides with the same number of neutrons are called [[isotone]]s. The [[atomic mass number]], symbol A, equals Z+N. Nuclides with the same atomic mass number are called [[isobar (nuclide)|isobar]]s. The nucleus of the most common [[isotope]] of the [[hydrogen atom]] (with the [[chemical symbol]] &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H) is a lone proton. The nuclei of the heavy hydrogen isotopes [[deuterium]] (D or &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;H) and [[tritium]] (T or &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;H) contain one proton bound to one and two neutrons, respectively. All other types of atomic nuclei are composed of two or more protons and various numbers of neutrons. The most common nuclide of the common chemical element [[lead]], &lt;sup&gt;208&lt;/sup&gt;Pb, has 82 protons and 126 neutrons, for example. The [[table of nuclides]] comprises all the known nuclides. Even though it is not a chemical element, the neutron is included in this table.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nndc.bnl.gov/nudat2 Nudat 2].

The neutron has no measurable electric charge. With its positive electric charge, the proton is directly influenced by [[electric fields]], whereas the neutron is unaffected by electric fields. The neutron has a [[neutron magnetic moment|magnetic moment]], however, so the neutron is influenced by [[magnetic field]]s. The neutron's magnetic moment has a negative value, because its orientation is opposite to the neutron's spin.&lt;ref name=Llewellyn&gt;{{cite book |title=Modern Physics |author1=Tipler, Paul Allen |author2=Llewellyn, Ralph A. |url=https://books.google.com/?id=tpU18JqcSNkC&amp;pg=PA310 |page=310 |isbn=0-7167-4345-0 |year=2002 |edition=4 |publisher=[[Macmillan Publishers (United States)|Macmillan]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A free neutron is unstable, [[free neutron decay|decaying]] to a proton, [[electron]] and [[antineutrino]] with a [[mean lifetime]] of just under 15 minutes ({{val|881.5|1.5|u=s}}).&lt;ref name="RPP"/&gt; This [[radioactive decay]], known as [[beta decay]], is possible because the mass of the neutron is slightly greater than the proton. The free proton is stable. Neutrons or protons bound in a nucleus can be stable or unstable, however, depending on the [[nuclide]]. Beta decay, in which neutrons decay to protons, or vice versa, is governed by the [[weak interaction|weak force]], and it requires the emission or absorption of electrons and neutrinos, or their antiparticles.

[[File:Nuclear fission.svg|thumb|150px|right|Nuclear fission caused by absorption of a neutron by uranium-235. The heavy nuclide fragments into lighter components and additional neutrons.]]
Protons and neutrons behave almost identically under the influence of the nuclear force within the nucleus. The concept of [[isospin]], in which the proton and neutron are viewed as two quantum states of the same particle, is used to model the interactions of nucleons by the nuclear or weak forces. Because of the strength of the nuclear force at short distances, the [[binding energy]] of nucleons is more than seven orders of magnitude larger than the electromagnetic energy binding electrons in atoms. [[Nuclear reaction]]s (such as [[nuclear fission]]) therefore have an [[energy density]] that is more than ten million times that of [[chemical reaction]]s. Because of the [[mass–energy equivalence]], nuclear binding energies add or subtract from the mass of nuclei. Ultimately, the ability of the nuclear force to store energy arising from the electromagnetic repulsion of nuclear components is the basis for most of the energy that makes nuclear reactors or bombs possible. In nuclear fission, the absorption of a neutron by a heavy nuclide (e.g., [[uranium-235]]) causes the nuclide to become unstable and break into light nuclides and additional neutrons. The positively charged light nuclides then repel, releasing electromagnetic [[potential energy]].

The neutron is classified as a ''[[hadron]]'', because it is a [[composite particle]] made of [[quark]]s. The neutron is also classified as a ''[[baryon]]'', because it is composed of three [[valence quark]]s.&lt;ref&gt;

==Discovery==
{{Main|Discovery of the neutron}}
The story of the discovery of the neutron and its properties is central to the extraordinary developments in atomic physics that occurred in the first half of the 20th century, leading ultimately to the atomic bomb in 1945. In the 1911 Rutherford model, the atom consisted of a small positively charged massive nucleus surrounded by a much larger cloud of negatively charged electrons. In 1920, Rutherford suggested that the nucleus consisted of positive protons and neutrally-charged particles, suggested to be a proton and an electron bound in some way.&lt;ref name="BakLec"&gt;

==Beta decay and the stability of the nucleus==

[[File:Beta Negative Decay.svg|thumb|200px|The [[Feynman diagram]] for beta decay of a neutron into a [[proton]], [[electron]], and [[electron antineutrino]] via an intermediate heavy [[W boson]]]]

Under the [[Standard Model]] of particle physics, the only possible decay mode for the neutron that [[conservation law|conserves]] [[baryon number]] is for one of the neutron's quarks to [[flavour changing processes|change]] [[flavour (physics)|flavour]] via the [[weak interaction]]. The decay of one of the neutron's down quarks into a lighter up quark can be achieved by the emission of a [[W boson]]. By this process, the Standard Model description of [[beta decay]], the neutron decays into a [[proton]] (which contains one down and two up quarks), an [[electron]], and an [[electron neutrino|electron antineutrino]].

Since interacting protons have a mutual [[electromagnetic interaction|electromagnetic repulsion]] that is stronger than their attractive [[nuclear force|nuclear interaction]], neutrons are a necessary constituent of any atomic nucleus that contains more than one proton (see [[diproton]] and [[neutron–proton ratio]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://ansnuclearcafe.org/2011/10/19/pioneers102011/ Sir James Chadwick’s Discovery of Neutrons]. ANS Nuclear Cafe. Retrieved on 2012-08-16.&lt;/ref&gt; Neutrons bind with protons and one another in the nucleus via the [[nuclear force]], effectively moderating the repulsive forces between the protons and stabilizing the nucleus.

===Free neutron decay===
{{main|Free neutron decay}}
Outside the nucleus, free neutrons are unstable and have a [[mean lifetime]] of {{val|881.5|1.5|u=s}} (about 14 minutes, 42 seconds); therefore the [[half-life]] for this process (which differs from the mean lifetime by a factor of {{nowrap|[[Natural logarithm|ln]](2) {{=}} 0.693}}) is {{val|611.0|1.0|u=s}} (about 10 minutes, 11 seconds).&lt;ref name="RPP"/&gt; Beta decay of the neutron, described above, can be denoted by the [[radioactive decay]]:&lt;ref&gt;[http://pdg.lbl.gov/2007/tables/bxxx.pdf Particle Data Group Summary Data Table on Baryons]. lbl.gov (2007). Retrieved on 2012-08-16.&lt;/ref&gt;
:{{SubatomicParticle|Neutron0}} → {{SubatomicParticle|Proton+}} + {{SubatomicParticle|Electron}} + {{SubatomicParticle|Electron antineutrino}}

where {{SubatomicParticle|Proton+}}, {{SubatomicParticle|Electron}}, and {{SubatomicParticle|Electron antineutrino}} denote the proton, electron and electron antineutrino, respectively.
For the free neutron the [[decay energy]] for this process (based on the masses of the neutron, proton, and electron) is 0.782343 MeV. The maximal energy of the beta decay electron (in the process wherein the neutrino receives a vanishingly small amount of kinetic energy) has been measured at 0.782 ± 0.013 MeV.&lt;ref&gt;Basic Ideas and Concepts in Nuclear Physics: An Introductory Approach, Third Edition; K. Heyde Taylor &amp; Francis 2004. Print {{ISBN|978-0-7503-0980-6}}. eBook {{ISBN|978-1-4200-5494-1}}. DOI: 10.1201/9781420054941.ch5. [http://www.crcnetbase.com/doi/abs/10.1201/9781420054941.ch5 full text]&lt;/ref&gt; The latter number is not well-enough measured to determine the comparatively tiny rest mass of the [[neutrino]] (which must in theory be subtracted from the maximal electron kinetic energy) as well as neutrino mass is constrained by many other methods.

A small fraction (about one in 1000) of free neutrons decay with the same products, but add an extra particle in the form of an emitted gamma ray:
:{{SubatomicParticle|Neutron0}} → {{SubatomicParticle|Proton+}} + {{SubatomicParticle|Electron}} + {{SubatomicParticle|Electron antineutrino}} + {{SubatomicParticle|gamma}}

This gamma ray may be thought of as an "internal [[bremsstrahlung]]" that arises from the electromagnetic interaction of the emitted beta particle with the proton. Internal bremsstrahlung gamma ray production is also a minor feature of beta decays of bound neutrons (as discussed below).

In the Rutherford model for the nucleus, red spheres were protons with positive charge and blue spheres were protons tightly bound to an electron with no net charge.&lt;br&gt;
The '''inset''' shows beta decay of a free neutron as it is understood today; an electron and antineutrino are created in this process.]]
A very small minority of neutron decays (about four per million) are so-called "two-body (neutron) decays", in which a proton, electron and antineutrino are produced as usual, but the electron fails to gain the 13.6 eV necessary energy to escape the proton (the [[ionization energy]] of [[hydrogen]]), and therefore simply remains bound to it, as a neutral [[hydrogen atom]] (one of the "two bodies"). In this type of free neutron decay, almost all of the neutron [[decay energy]] is carried off by the antineutrino (the other "body"). (The hydrogen atom recoils with a speed of only about (decay energy)/(hydrogen rest energy) times the speed of light, or 250&amp;nbsp;km/s.)

The transformation of a free proton to a neutron (plus a positron and a neutrino) is energetically impossible, since a free neutron has a greater mass than a free proton. But a high-energy collision of a proton and an electron or neutrino can result in a neutron.

===Bound neutron decay===
{{Main|Atomic nucleus}}
While a free neutron has a half life of about 10.2 min, most neutrons within nuclei are stable. According to the [[nuclear shell model]], the protons and neutrons of a [[nuclide]] are a [[introduction to quantum mechanics|quantum mechanical system]] organized into discrete [[energy level]]s with unique [[quantum numbers]]. For a neutron to decay, the resulting proton requires an available state at lower energy than the initial neutron state. In stable nuclei the possible lower energy states are all filled, meaning they are each occupied by two protons with [[Spin (physics)|spin]] up and spin down. The [[Pauli exclusion principle]] therefore disallows the decay of a neutron to a proton within stable nuclei. The situation is similar to electrons of an atom, where electrons have distinct [[atomic orbital]]s and are prevented from decaying to lower energy states, with the emission of a [[photon]], by the exclusion principle.

Neutrons in unstable nuclei can decay by [[beta decay]] as described above. In this case, an energetically allowed quantum state is available for the proton resulting from the decay. One example of this decay is [[carbon-14]] (6 protons, 8 neutrons) that decays to [[nitrogen-14]] (7 protons, 7 neutrons) with a half-life of about 5,730 years.

Inside a nucleus, a proton can transform into a neutron via [[inverse beta decay]], if an energetically allowed quantum state is available for the neutron. This transformation occurs by emission of a [[positron]] and an electron [[neutrino]]:
:{{SubatomicParticle|Proton+}} → {{SubatomicParticle|Neutron0}} + {{SubatomicParticle|Positron}} + {{SubatomicParticle|Electron neutrino}}

The transformation of a proton to a neutron inside of a nucleus is also possible through [[electron capture]]:
:{{SubatomicParticle|Proton+}} + {{SubatomicParticle|Electron}} → {{SubatomicParticle|Neutron0}} + {{SubatomicParticle|Electron neutrino}}
Positron capture by neutrons in nuclei that contain an excess of neutrons is also possible, but is hindered because positrons are repelled by the positive nucleus, and quickly [[annihilation|annihilate]] when they encounter electrons.

===Competition of beta decay types===
Three types of beta decay in competition are illustrated by the single isotope [[copper-64]] (29 protons, 35 neutrons), which has a half-life of about 12.7 hours. This isotope has one unpaired proton and one unpaired neutron, so either the proton or the neutron can decay. This particular nuclide is almost equally likely to undergo proton decay (by [[positron emission]], 18% or by [[electron capture]], 43%) or neutron decay (by electron emission, 39%).

==Intrinsic properties==

===Mass===
The mass of a neutron cannot be directly determined by [[mass spectrometry]] due to lack of electric charge. However, since the masses of a proton and of a [[deuteron]] can be measured with a mass spectrometer, the mass of a neutron can be deduced by subtracting proton mass from deuteron mass, with the difference being the mass of the neutron plus the [[binding energy]] of deuterium (expressed as a positive emitted energy). The latter can be directly measured by measuring the energy (&lt;math&gt;B_d&lt;/math&gt;) of the single {{val|0.7822|u=MeV}} gamma photon emitted when neutrons are captured by protons (this is exothermic and happens with zero-energy neutrons), plus the small recoil kinetic energy (&lt;math&gt;E_{rd}&lt;/math&gt;) of the deuteron (about 0.06% of the total energy).
:&lt;math&gt;m_n= m_d - m_p + B_d - E_{rd}&lt;/math&gt;

The energy of the gamma ray can be measured to high precision by X-ray diffraction techniques, as was first done by Bell and Elliot in 1948.

:''m''&lt;sub&gt;neutron&lt;/sub&gt;= {{val|1.008644904|(14)|ul=u}}

The value for the neutron mass in MeV is less accurately known, due to less accuracy in the known conversion of [[atomic mass unit|u]] to MeV:&lt;ref&gt;Byrne, J. ''Neutrons, Nuclei, and Matter'', Dover Publications, Mineola, New York, 2011, {{ISBN|0486482383}}, pp. 18–19&lt;/ref&gt;
:''m''&lt;sub&gt;neutron&lt;/sub&gt;= {{val|939.56563|(28)|ul=MeV/c2}}.

Another method to determine the mass of a neutron starts from the beta decay of the neutron, when the momenta of the resulting proton and electron are measured.

===Electric charge===
The total electric charge of the neutron is {{val|0|u=[[elementary charge|''e'']]}}. This zero value has been tested experimentally, and the present experimental limit for the charge of the neutron is {{val|-2|(8)|e=-22|u=[[elementary charge|''e'']]}},&lt;ref name="PDGLIVE"&gt;

===Magnetic moment===
{{Main|Neutron magnetic moment}}
Even though the neutron is a neutral particle, the magnetic moment of a neutron is not zero. The neutron is not affected by electric fields, but it is affected by magnetic fields. The magnetic moment of the neutron is an indication of its quark substructure and internal charge distribution.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal

The value for the neutron's magnetic moment was first directly measured by [[Luis Walter Alvarez|Luis Alvarez]] and [[Felix Bloch]] at [[Berkeley, California]], in 1940,&lt;ref name="Alvarez"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Alvarez |first1=L. W |last2=Bloch |first2=F.

Alvarez and Bloch determined the magnetic moment of the neutron to be {{nowrap|1=''μ''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;= {{val|-1.93|(2)|u=''μ''&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;}}}}, where ''μ''&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[nuclear magneton]].

In the [[quark model]] for [[hadrons]], the neutron is composed of one up quark (charge +2/3&amp;nbsp;''e'') and two down quarks (charge −1/3&amp;nbsp;''e'').&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The magnetic moment of the neutron can be modeled as a sum of the magnetic moments of the constituent quarks.&lt;ref name="Perk"&gt;{{Citation |author1-last= Perkins |author1-first= Donald H. |title= Introduction to High Energy Physics |pages=201–202 |publisher= Addison Wesley, Reading, Massachusetts |publication-date= 1982 |isbn= 0-201-05757-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The calculation assumes that the quarks behave like pointlike Dirac particles, each having their own magnetic moment. Simplistically, the magnetic moment of the neutron can be viewed as resulting from the vector sum of the three quark magnetic moments, plus the orbital magnetic moments caused by the movement of the three charged quarks within the neutron.

In one of the early successes of the Standard Model ([[SU(6) (physics)|SU(6) theory]], now understood in terms of quark behavior), in 1964 Mirza A. B. Beg, [[Benjamin W. Lee]], and [[Abraham Pais]] theoretically calculated the ratio of proton to neutron magnetic moments to be −3/2, which agrees with the experimental value to within 3%.&lt;ref name="Greenberg"&gt;

The above treatment compares neutrons with protons, allowing the complex behavior of quarks to be subtracted out between models, and merely exploring what the effects would be of differing quark charges (or quark type). Such calculations are enough to show that the interior of neutrons is very much like that of protons, save for the difference in quark composition with a down quark in the neutron replacing an up quark in the proton.

Attempts have been made to quantitatively recover the neutron magnetic moment from first principles. From the [[special relativity|nonrelativistic]], quantum mechanical [[wavefunction]] for [[baryon]]s composed of three quarks, a straightforward calculation gives fairly accurate estimates for the magnetic moments of neutrons, protons, and other baryons.&lt;ref name="Perk"/&gt; For a neutron, the end result of this calculation is that the magnetic moment of the neutron is given by {{nowrap|1=''μ''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;= 4/3 ''μ''&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt; − 1/3 ''μ''&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt;}}, where ''μ''&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt; and ''μ''&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt; are the magnetic moments for the down and up quarks, respectively. This result combines the intrinsic magnetic moments of the quarks with their orbital magnetic moments, and assumes the three quarks are in a particular, dominant quantum state.

===Spin===
The neutron is a spin 1/2 particle, that is, it is a [[fermion]] with intrinsic angular momentum equal to 1/2 {{mvar|ħ}}, where {{mvar|ħ}} is the [[reduced Planck constant]]. For many years after the discovery of the neutron, its exact spin was ambiguous. Although it was assumed to be a spin 1/2 [[Dirac particle]], the possibility that the neutron was a spin 3/2 particle lingered. The interactions of the neutron's magnetic moment with an external magnetic field were exploited to finally determine the spin of the neutron.&lt;ref name="Byrne"&gt;{{cite book |title=Neutrons, Nuclei and Matter: An Exploration of the Physics of Slow Neutrons |author=J. Byrne |isbn= 0486482383 |year=2011 |location=Mineola, New York |publisher=Dover Publications |pages=28–31}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1949, Hughes and Burgy measured neutrons reflected from a ferromagnetic mirror and found that the angular distribution of the reflections was consistent with spin 1/2.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hughes |first1=D.

They recorded two such spin states, consistent with a spin 1/2 particle.&lt;ref name="Byrne"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sherwood"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sherwood |first1=J. E. |last2=Stephenson |first2=T.

As a fermion, the neutron is subject to the [[Pauli exclusion principle]]; two neutrons cannot have the same quantum numbers. This is the source of the [[degeneracy pressure]] which makes [[neutron star]]s possible.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a simplified classical view, the negative "skin" of the neutron assists it to be attracted to the protons with which it interacts in the nucleus. (However, the main attraction between neutrons and protons is via the [[nuclear force]], which does not involve electric charge.)

The simplified classical view of the neutron's charge distribution also "explains" the fact that the neutron magnetic dipole points in the opposite direction from its spin angular momentum vector (as compared to the proton). This gives the neutron, in effect, a magnetic moment which resembles a negatively charged particle. This can be reconciled classically with a neutral neutron composed of a charge distribution in which the negative sub-parts of the neutron have a larger average radius of distribution, and therefore contribute more to the particle's magnetic dipole moment, than do the positive parts that are, on average, nearer the core.

===Electric dipole moment===

The [[Standard Model|Standard Model of particle physics]] predicts a tiny separation of positive and negative charge within the neutron leading to a permanent [[electric dipole moment]].&lt;ref name="sussex"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The predicted value is, however, well below the current sensitivity of experiments. From several [[list of unsolved problems in physics#High-energy physics/particle physics|unsolved puzzles in particle physics]], it is clear that the Standard Model is not the final and full description of all particles and their interactions. New theories going [[beyond the Standard Model]] generally lead to much larger predictions for the electric dipole moment of the neutron. Currently, there are at least four experiments trying to measure for the first time a finite neutron electric dipole moment, including:

===Anti-neutron===
{{Main|Antineutron}}

The antineutron is the [[antiparticle]] of the neutron. It was discovered by [[Bruce Cork]] in the year 1956, a year after the [[antiproton]] was discovered. [[CPT-symmetry]] puts strong constraints on the relative properties of particles and antiparticles, so studying antineutrons provides stringent tests on CPT-symmetry. The fractional difference in the masses of the neutron and antineutron is {{val|9|6|e=-5}}. Since the difference is only about two [[standard deviation]]s away from zero, this does not give any convincing evidence of CPT-violation.&lt;ref name="RPP"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1088/0954-3899/37/7A/075021|title=Review of Particle Physics|year=2010|last1=Nakamura|first1=K|journal=Journal of Physics G: Nuclear and Particle Physics|volume=37|issue=7A|pages=075021|bibcode= 2010JPhG...37g5021N|url=http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0954-3899/37/7A/075021/pdf}} [http://pdg.lbl.gov/2011/listings/rpp2011-list-n.pdf PDF with 2011 partial update for the 2012 edition]
The exact value of the mean lifetime is still uncertain, due to conflicting results from experiments.
The Particle Data Group reports values up to six seconds apart (more than four standard deviations), commenting that "our 2006, 2008, and 2010 Reviews stayed with 885.7±0.8 s; but we noted that in light of SEREBROV 05 our value should be regarded as suspect until further experiments clarified matters. Since our 2010 Review, PICHLMAIER 10 has obtained a mean life of 880.7±1.8 s, closer to the value of SEREBROV 05 than to our average. And SEREBROV 10B[...] claims their values should be lowered by about 6 s, which would bring them into line with the two lower values. However, those reevaluations have not received an enthusiastic response from the experimenters in question; and in any case the Particle Data Group would have to await published changes (by those experimenters) of published values.

At this point, we can think of nothing better to do than to average the seven best but discordant measurements, getting 881.5±1.5s. Note that the error includes a scale factor of 2.7. This is a jump of 4.2 old (and 2.8 new) standard deviations. This state of affairs is a particularly unhappy one, because the value is so important. We again call upon the experimenters to clear this up."
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dineutrons and tetraneutrons===
{{Main|Dineutron|Tetraneutron}}

The existence of stable clusters of 4 neutrons, or [[tetraneutron]]s, has been hypothesised by a team led by Francisco-Miguel Marqués at the CNRS Laboratory for Nuclear Physics based on observations of the disintegration of [[beryllium]]-14 nuclei. This is particularly interesting because current theory suggests that these clusters should not be stable.

In February 2016, Japanese physicist Susumu Shimoura of [[the University of Tokyo]] and co-workers reported they had observed the purported tetraneutrons for the first time experimentally.&lt;ref name="Kisamori"&gt;{{cite journal |last= Kisamori |first= K. |display-authors= etal |year= 2016 |title= Candidate Resonant Tetraneutron State Populated by the He4(He8,Be8) Reaction |journal= [[Physical Review Letters]] |volume= 116 |issue= 5 |pages= 052501 |doi= 10.1103/PhysRevLett.116.052501|bibcode= 2016PhRvL.116e2501K }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nuclear physicists around the world say this discovery, if confirmed, would be a milestone in the field of nuclear physics and certainly would deepen our understanding of the nuclear forces.&lt;ref name="sciencealert"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sciencenews.org/article/physicists-find-signs-four-neutron-nucleus|title=Physicists find signs of four-neutron nucleus}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Nigel|last=Orr|title=Can Four Neutrons Tango?|url=http://physics.aps.org/articles/v9/14|website=physics.aps.org|publisher=American Physical Society|accessdate=2016-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[dineutron]] is another hypothetical particle. In 2012, Artemis Spyrou from Michigan State University and coworkers reported that they observed, for the first time, the dineutron emission in the decay of &lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt;Be. The dineutron character is evidenced by a small emission angle between the two neutrons. The authors measured the two-neutron separation energy to be 1.35(10) MeV, in good agreement with shell model calculations, using standard interactions for this mass region.&lt;ref name="Spyrou"&gt;{{cite journal |last= Spyrou |first= A. |year= 2012 |title= First Observation of Ground State Dineutron Decay: 16Be |journal= [[Physical Review Letters]] |volume= 108 |pages= 102501 |doi= 10.1103/PhysRevLett.108.102501|bibcode= 2012PhRvL.108j2501S |pmid=22463404 |issue=10|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neutronium and neutron stars===
{{Main|Neutronium|Neutron star}}
At extremely high pressures and temperatures, nucleons and electrons are believed to collapse into bulk neutronic matter, called [[neutronium]]. This is presumed to happen in [[neutron star]]s.

The extreme pressure inside a neutron star may deform the neutrons into a cubic symmetry, allowing tighter packing of neutrons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Llanes-Estrada|arxiv=1108.1859|title=Cubic neutrons |year=2011 |version= |first1=Felipe J. |first2=Gaspar|last2= Moreno Navarro |doi=10.1142/S0217732312500332 |volume=27 |issue=6|journal=Modern Physics Letters A |page=1250033|bibcode=2012MPLA...2750033L}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Detection==
{{Main|Neutron detection}}
The common means of detecting a [[electric charge|charged]] [[elementary particle|particle]] by looking for a track of ionization (such as in a [[cloud chamber]]) does not work for neutrons directly. Neutrons that elastically scatter off atoms can create an ionization track that is detectable, but the experiments are not as simple to carry out; other means for detecting neutrons, consisting of allowing them to interact with atomic nuclei, are more commonly used. The commonly used methods to detect neutrons can therefore be categorized according to the nuclear processes relied upon, mainly [[neutron capture]] or [[elastic scattering]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter= Ch. 14 |title=Radiation Detection and Measurement|author= Knoll, Glenn F. |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|year= 1979|isbn=047149545X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neutron detection by neutron capture===
A common method for detecting neutrons involves converting the energy released from [[neutron capture]] reactions into electrical signals. Certain nuclides have a high neutron capture [[cross section (physics)|cross section]], which is the probability of absorbing a neutron. Upon neutron capture, the compound nucleus emits more easily detectable radiation, for example an alpha particle, which is then detected. The nuclides {{SimpleNuclide2|Helium|3}}, {{SimpleNuclide2|Lithium|6}}, {{SimpleNuclide2|Boron|10}}, {{SimpleNuclide2|Uranium|233}}, {{SimpleNuclide2|Uranium|235}}, {{SimpleNuclide2|Neptunium|237}}, and {{SimpleNuclide2|Plutonium|239}} are useful for this purpose. &lt;!-- The following needs correction, errors due to lack of reference: These nuclides are rarely found in nature, but can be accumulated through processes such as isotopic enrichment.

The cross section for the process of neutron capture is much lower at high energies than at low energies. Therefore, the detection of neutrons by neutron capture requires a preceding slowing down of neutrons. For this purpose, a [[neutron moderator]] is used, typically a thick slab of polyethylene. Neutron detectors using the moderate-and-capture approach cannot measure neutron energy, precise time of arrival, or direction of incidence, because this information is lost during moderation. --&gt;

===Neutron detection by elastic scattering===
Neutrons can elastically scatter off nuclei, causing the struck nucleus to recoil. Kinematically, a neutron can transfer more energy to a light nucleus such as hydrogen or helium than to a heavier nucleus. Detectors relying on elastic scattering are called fast neutron detectors. Recoiling nuclei can ionize and excite further atoms through collisions. Charge and/or scintillation light produced in this way can be collected to produce a detected signal. A major challenge in fast neutron detection is discerning such signals from erroneous signals produced by gamma radiation in the same detector.

Fast neutron detectors have the advantage of not requiring a moderator, and are therefore capable of measuring the neutron's energy, time of arrival, and in certain cases direction of incidence.

==Sources and production==
{{Main|Neutron source|Neutron generator|Research reactor}}
Free neutrons are unstable, although they have the longest half-life of any unstable subatomic particle by several orders of magnitude. Their half-life is still only about 10 minutes, however, so they can be obtained only from sources that produce them continuously.

'''Natural neutron background.''' A small natural background flux of free neutrons exists everywhere on Earth. In the atmosphere and deep into the ocean, the "neutron background" is caused by [[muon]]s produced by [[cosmic ray]] interaction with the atmosphere. These high-energy muons are capable of penetration to considerable depths in water and soil. There, in striking atomic nuclei, among other reactions they induce spallation reactions in which a neutron is liberated from the nucleus. Within the Earth's crust a second source is neutrons produced primarily by spontaneous fission of uranium and thorium present in crustal minerals. The neutron background is not strong enough to be a biological hazard, but it is of importance to very high resolution particle detectors that are looking for very rare events, such as (hypothesized) interactions that might be caused by particles of [[dark matter]].&lt;ref name="NatNeu"/&gt; Recent research has shown that even thunderstorms can produce neutrons with energies of up to several tens of MeV.&lt;ref name="KohnEbert"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Köhn |first1=C. |last2=Ebert |first2=U. |title=Calculation of beams of positrons, neutrons and protons associated with terrestrial gamma-ray flashes |journal=[[J.

Even stronger neutron background radiation is produced at the surface of Mars, where the atmosphere is thick enough to generate neutrons from cosmic ray muon production and neutron-spallation, but not thick enough to provide significant protection from the neutrons produced. These neutrons not only produce a Martian surface neutron radiation hazard from direct downward-going neutron radiation but may also produce a significant hazard from reflection of neutrons from the Martian surface, which will produce reflected neutron radiation penetrating upward into a Martian craft or habitat from the floor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Clowdsley |url=http://www.physicamedica.com/VOLXVII_S1/20-CLOWDSLEY%20et%20alii.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050225054811/http://www.physicamedica.com/VOLXVII_S1/20-CLOWDSLEY%20et%20alii.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2005-02-25 |journal=Physica Medica |first1=MS |volume=17 |issue=Suppl 1 |last2=Wilson |pages=94–6 |first2=JW |last3=Kim |first3=MH |last4=Singleterry |first4=RC |last5=Tripathi |first5=RK |last6=Heinbockel |first6=JH |last7=Badavi |first7=FF |last8=Shinn |first8=JL |title=Neutron Environments on the Martian Surface |year=2001 |pmid=11770546 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sources of neutrons for research.''' These include certain types of [[radioactive decay]] ([[spontaneous fission]] and [[neutron emission]]), and from certain [[nuclear reaction]]s. Convenient nuclear reactions include tabletop reactions such as natural alpha and gamma bombardment of certain nuclides, often beryllium or deuterium, and induced [[nuclear fission]], such as occurs in nuclear reactors. In addition, high-energy nuclear reactions (such as occur in cosmic radiation showers or accelerator collisions) also produce neutrons from disintegration of target nuclei. Small (tabletop) [[particle accelerator]]s optimized to produce free neutrons in this way, are called [[neutron generator]]s.

In practice, the most commonly used small laboratory sources of neutrons use radioactive decay to power neutron production. One noted neutron-producing [[radioisotope]], [[californium]]-252 decays (half-life 2.65 years) by [[spontaneous fission]] 3% of the time with production of 3.7 neutrons per fission, and is used alone as a neutron source from this process. [[Nuclear reaction]] sources (that involve two materials) powered by radioisotopes use an [[alpha decay]] source plus a beryllium target, or else a source of high-energy gamma radiation from a source that undergoes [[beta decay]] followed by [[gamma decay]], which produces [[photoneutron]]s on interaction of the high-energy [[gamma ray]] with ordinary stable beryllium, or else with the [[deuterium]] in [[heavy water]]. A popular [[startup neutron source|source of the latter type]] is radioactive [[antimony-124]] plus beryllium, a system with a half-life of 60.9 days, which can be constructed from natural antimony (which is 42.8% stable antimony-123) by activating it with neutrons in a nuclear reactor, then transported to where the neutron source is needed.&lt;ref&gt;Byrne, J. ''Neutrons, Nuclei, and Matter'', Dover Publications, Mineola, New York, 2011, {{ISBN|0486482383}}, pp. 32–33.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Institut Laue–Langevin (ILL) in Grenoble, France.jpg|thumb|right|[[Institut Laue–Langevin]] (ILL) in Grenoble, France – a major neutron research facility.]]

[[Nuclear reactor|Nuclear fission reactors]] naturally produce free neutrons; their role is to sustain the energy-producing [[chain reaction]]. The intense [[neutron radiation]] can also be used to produce various radioisotopes through the process of [[neutron activation]], which is a type of [[neutron capture]].

Experimental [[fusion power|nuclear fusion reactors]] produce free neutrons as a waste product. However, it is these neutrons that possess most of the energy, and converting that energy to a useful form has proved a difficult engineering challenge. Fusion reactors that generate neutrons are likely to create radioactive waste, but the waste is composed of neutron-activated lighter isotopes, which have relatively short (50–100 years) decay periods as compared to typical half-lives of 10,000 years{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}&lt;!--the reference gives many thousands of years--&gt; for fission waste, which is long due primarily to the long half-life of alpha-emitting transuranic actinides.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/4627237.stm Science/Nature |Q&amp;A: Nuclear fusion reactor]. BBC News (2006-02-06). Retrieved on 2010-12-04.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neutron beams and modification of beams after production===
Free neutron beams are obtained from [[neutron source]]s by [[neutron transport]]. For access to intense neutron sources, researchers must go to a specialized [[neutron research facility|neutron facility]] that operates a [[research reactor]] or a [[spallation]] source.

The neutron's lack of total electric charge makes it difficult to steer or accelerate them. Charged particles can be accelerated, decelerated, or deflected by [[electric field|electric]] or [[magnetic field]]s. These methods have little effect on neutrons. However, some effects may be attained by use of inhomogeneous magnetic fields because of the [[neutron magnetic moment|neutron's magnetic moment]]. Neutrons can be controlled by methods that include [[neutron moderator|moderation]], [[neutron reflector|reflection]], and [[neutron-velocity selector|velocity selection]]. [[Thermal neutron]]s can be polarized by transmission through [[magnet]]ic materials in a method analogous to the [[Faraday effect]] for [[photon]]s. Cold neutrons of wavelengths of 6–7 angstroms can be produced in beams of a high degree of polarization, by use of [[neutron supermirror|magnetic mirror]]s and magnetized interference filters.&lt;ref&gt;Byrne, J. ''Neutrons, Nuclei, and Matter'', Dover Publications, Mineola, New York, 2011, {{ISBN|0486482383}}, p. 453.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
{{Science with neutrons}}

The neutron plays an important role in many nuclear reactions. For example, neutron capture often results in [[neutron activation]], inducing [[radioactivity]]. In particular, knowledge of neutrons and their behavior has been important in the development of [[nuclear reactor]]s and [[nuclear weapon]]s. The [[nuclear fission|fissioning]] of elements like [[uranium-235]] and [[plutonium-239]] is caused by their absorption of neutrons.

[[Neutron temperature|''Cold'', ''thermal'', and ''hot'']] [[neutron radiation]] is commonly employed in [[neutron scattering]] facilities, where the radiation is used in a similar way one uses [[X-ray]]s for the analysis of [[condensed matter]]. Neutrons are complementary to the latter in terms of atomic contrasts by different scattering [[cross section (physics)|cross sections]]; sensitivity to magnetism; energy range for inelastic neutron spectroscopy; and deep penetration into matter.

The development of "neutron lenses" based on total internal reflection within hollow glass capillary tubes or by reflection from dimpled aluminum plates has driven ongoing research into neutron microscopy and neutron/gamma ray tomography.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kumakhov |first=M. A. |author2=Sharov, V. A. |year=1992 |title=A neutron lens |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |volume=357 |issue= 6377|pages=390–391 |doi=10.1038/357390a0 |bibcode= 1992Natur.357..390K}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.physorg.com/news599.html Physorg.com, "New Way of 'Seeing': A 'Neutron Microscope'"]. Physorg.com (2004-07-30). Retrieved on 2012-08-16.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nasa.gov/vision/earth/technologies/nuggets.html "NASA Develops a Nugget to Search for Life in Space"]. NASA.gov (2007-11-30). Retrieved on 2012-08-16.&lt;/ref&gt;

A major use of neutrons is to excite delayed and prompt [[gamma ray]]s from elements in materials. This forms the basis of [[neutron activation analysis]] (NAA) and [[prompt gamma neutron activation analysis]] (PGNAA). NAA is most often used to analyze small samples of materials in a [[nuclear reactor]] whilst PGNAA is most often used to analyze subterranean rocks around [[bore hole]]s and industrial bulk materials on conveyor belts.

Another use of neutron emitters is the detection of light nuclei, in particular the hydrogen found in water molecules. When a fast neutron collides with a light nucleus, it loses a large fraction of its energy. By measuring the rate at which slow neutrons return to the probe after reflecting off of hydrogen nuclei, a [[neutron probe]] may determine the water content in soil.

==Medical therapies==
{{Main|Fast neutron therapy|Neutron capture therapy of cancer}}
Because neutron radiation is both penetrating and ionizing, it can be exploited for medical treatments. Neutron radiation can have the unfortunate side-effect of leaving the affected area radioactive, however. [[Neutron tomography]] is therefore not a viable medical application.

Fast neutron therapy utilizes high-energy neutrons typically greater than 20 MeV to treat cancer. [[Radiation therapy]] of cancers is based upon the biological response of cells to ionizing radiation. If radiation is delivered in small sessions to damage cancerous areas, normal tissue will have time to repair itself, while tumor cells often cannot.&lt;ref&gt;Hall EJ (2000). ''Radiobiology for the Radiologist''. Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins; 5th edition&lt;/ref&gt; Neutron radiation can deliver energy to a cancerous region at a rate an order of magnitude larger than [[gamma radiation]]&lt;ref&gt;Johns HE and Cunningham JR (1978). ''The Physics of Radiology''. Charles C Thomas 3rd edition&lt;/ref&gt;

Beams of low-energy neutrons are used in [[neutron capture therapy of cancer|boron capture therapy]] to treat cancer. In boron capture therapy, the patient is given a drug that contains boron and that preferentially accumulates in the tumor to be targeted. The tumor is then bombarded with very low-energy neutrons (although often higher than thermal energy) which are captured by the [[boron-10]] isotope in the boron, which produces an excited state of boron-11 that then decays to produce [[lithium-7]] and an [[alpha particle]] that have sufficient energy to kill the malignant cell, but insufficient range to damage nearby cells. For such a therapy to be applied to the treatment of cancer, a neutron source having an intensity of the order of a thousand million (10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;) neutrons per second per cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is preferred. Such fluxes require a research nuclear reactor.

==Protection==
Exposure to free neutrons can be hazardous, since the interaction of neutrons with molecules in the body can cause disruption to [[molecule]]s and [[atom]]s, and can also cause reactions that give rise to other forms of [[radiation]] (such as protons). The normal precautions of radiation protection apply: Avoid exposure, stay as far from the source as possible, and keep exposure time to a minimum. Some particular thought must be given to how to protect from neutron exposure, however. For other types of radiation, e.g., [[alpha particle]]s, [[beta particle]]s, or [[gamma ray]]s, material of a high atomic number and with high density make for good shielding; frequently, [[lead]] is used. However, this approach will not work with neutrons, since the absorption of neutrons does not increase straightforwardly with atomic number, as it does with alpha, beta, and gamma radiation. Instead one needs to look at the particular interactions neutrons have with matter (see the section on detection above). For example, [[hydrogen]]-rich materials are often used to shield against neutrons, since ordinary hydrogen both scatters and slows neutrons. This often means that simple concrete blocks or even paraffin-loaded plastic blocks afford better protection from neutrons than do far more dense materials. After slowing, neutrons may then be absorbed with an isotope that has high affinity for slow neutrons without causing secondary capture radiation, such as lithium-6.

Hydrogen-rich [[water|ordinary water]] affects neutron absorption in [[nuclear fission]] reactors: Usually, neutrons are so strongly absorbed by normal water that fuel enrichment with fissionable isotope is required.{{clarify|reason=A step of logic is missing here. Are the neutrons needed to make something fission? Why is so much water used if it is too much?|date=May 2015}} The [[deuterium]] in [[heavy water]] has a very much lower absorption affinity for neutrons than does protium (normal light hydrogen). Deuterium is, therefore, used in [[CANDU]]-type reactors, in order to slow ([[neutron moderator|moderate]]) neutron velocity, to increase the probability of [[nuclear fission]] compared to [[neutron capture]].

==Neutron temperature==
{{Main|Neutron temperature}}

===Thermal neutrons===
A ''thermal neutron'' is a [[free neutron]] that is [[Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution|Boltzmann distributed]] with kT= {{val|0.0253|ul=eV}} ({{val|4.0|e=-21|ul=J}}) at room temperature. This gives characteristic (not average, or median) speed of 2.2&amp;nbsp;km/s. The name 'thermal' comes from their energy being that of the room temperature gas or material they are permeating. (see ''[[kinetic theory of gases|kinetic theory]]'' for energies and speeds of molecules). After a number of collisions (often in the range of 10–20) with nuclei, neutrons arrive at this energy level, provided that they are not absorbed.

In many substances, thermal neutron reactions show a much larger effective cross-section than reactions involving faster neutrons, and thermal neutrons can therefore be absorbed more readily (i.e., with higher probability) by any [[atomic nucleus|atomic nuclei]] that they collide with, creating a heavier — and often [[unstable isotope|unstable]] — [[isotope]] of the [[chemical element]] as a result.

Most [[nuclear reactor|fission reactors]] use a [[neutron moderator]] to slow down, or ''thermalize'' the neutrons that are emitted by [[nuclear fission]] so that they are more easily captured, causing further fission. Others, called [[fast breeder]] reactors, use fission energy neutrons directly.

===Cold neutrons===
''Cold neutrons'' are thermal neutrons that have been equilibrated in a very cold substance such as liquid [[deuterium]]. Such a ''cold source'' is placed in the moderator of a research reactor or spallation source. Cold neutrons are particularly valuable for [[neutron scattering]] experiments.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

[[File:Cold Neutron Source.jpg|right|thumb|350px|Cold neutron source providing neutrons at about the temperature of liquid hydrogen]]

===Ultracold neutrons===
[[Ultracold neutrons]] are produced by elastically scattering cold neutrons in substances with a temperature of a few kelvins, such as solid [[deuterium]] or superfluid [[helium]]. An alternative production method is the mechanical deceleration of cold neutrons.

===Fission energy neutrons===
{{Main|Nuclear fission}}
A ''fast neutron'' is a free neutron with a kinetic energy level close to {{val|1|ul=MeV}} ({{val|1.6|e=-13|ul=J}}), hence a speed of ~{{val|14000|u=km/s}} (~{{hsp}}5% of the speed of light). They are named ''fission energy'' or ''fast'' neutrons to distinguish them from lower-energy thermal neutrons, and high-energy neutrons produced in cosmic showers or accelerators. Fast neutrons are produced by nuclear processes such as [[nuclear fission]]. Neutrons produced in fission, as noted above, have a [[Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution]] of kinetic energies from 0 to ~14 MeV, a mean energy of 2 MeV (for U-235 fission neutrons), and a [[mode (statistics)|mode]] of only 0.75 MeV, which means that more than half of them do not qualify as fast (and thus have almost no chance of initiating fission in [[fertile material]]s, such as U-238 and Th-232).

Fast neutrons can be made into thermal neutrons via a process called moderation. This is done with a [[neutron moderator]]. In reactors, typically [[heavy water]], [[light water reactor|light water]], or [[graphite]] are used to moderate neutrons.

===Fusion neutrons===
[[File:fusion rxnrate.svg|right|300px|thumb|The fusion reaction rate increases rapidly with temperature until it maximizes and then gradually drops off. The DT rate peaks at a lower temperature (about 70&amp;nbsp;keV, or 800 million kelvins) and at a higher value than other reactions commonly considered for fusion energy.]]

{{Details|Nuclear fusion#Criteria and candidates for terrestrial reactions}}

D–T ([[deuterium]]–[[tritium]]) fusion is the [[D-T fusion|fusion reaction]] that produces the most energetic neutrons, with 14.1 [[MeV]] of [[kinetic energy]] and traveling at 17% of the [[speed of light]]. D–T fusion is also the easiest fusion reaction to ignite, reaching near-peak rates even when the deuterium and tritium nuclei have only a thousandth as much kinetic energy as the 14.1 MeV that will be produced.

14.1 MeV neutrons have about 10 times as much energy as fission neutrons, and are very effective at fissioning even non-[[fissile]] [[actinides|heavy nuclei]], and these high-energy fissions produce more neutrons on average than fissions by lower-energy neutrons. This makes D–T fusion neutron sources such as proposed [[tokamak]] power reactors useful for [[nuclear transmutation|transmutation]] of transuranic waste. 14.1 MeV neutrons can also produce neutrons by [[spallation#Nuclear spallation|knocking them loose from nuclei]].

On the other hand, these very high-energy neutrons are less likely to simply [[neutron capture|be captured without causing fission or spallation]]. For these reasons, [[nuclear weapon design]] extensively utilizes D–T fusion 14.1 MeV neutrons to [[fusion boosting|cause more fission]]. Fusion neutrons are able to cause fission in ordinarily non-fissile materials, such as [[depleted uranium]] (uranium-238), and these materials have been used in the jackets of [[thermonuclear weapon]]s. Fusion neutrons also can cause fission in substances that are unsuitable or difficult to make into primary fission bombs, such as [[reactor grade plutonium]]. This physical fact thus causes ordinary non-weapons grade materials to become of concern in certain [[nuclear proliferation]] discussions and treaties.

Other fusion reactions produce much less energetic neutrons. D–D fusion produces a 2.45 MeV neutron and [[helium-3]] half of the time, and produces [[tritium]] and a proton but no neutron the rest of the time. D–&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;He fusion produces no neutron.

===Intermediate-energy neutrons===
[[File:Sasahara.svg|thumb|right|300px|Transmutation flow in [[light water reactor]], which is a thermal-spectrum reactor]]
A fission energy neutron that has slowed down but not yet reached thermal energies is called an epithermal neutron.

[[Cross section (physics)|Cross sections]] for both [[neutron capture|capture]] and [[nuclear fission|fission]] reactions often have multiple [[resonance]] peaks at specific energies in the epithermal energy range.
These are of less significance in a [[fast neutron reactor]], where most neutrons are absorbed before slowing down to this range, or in a well-[[neutron moderator|moderated]] [[thermal reactor]], where epithermal neutrons interact mostly with moderator nuclei, not with either [[fissile]] or [[fertile material|fertile]] [[actinide]] nuclides.
However, in a partially moderated reactor with more interactions of epithermal neutrons with heavy metal nuclei, there are greater possibilities for [[transient state (chemical engineering)|transient]] changes in [[nuclear chain reaction|reactivity]] that might make reactor control more difficult.

Ratios of capture reactions to fission reactions are also worse (more captures without fission) in most [[nuclear fuel]]s such as [[plutonium-239]], making epithermal-spectrum reactors using these fuels less desirable, as captures not only waste the one neutron captured but also usually result in a [[nuclide]] that is not [[fissile]] with thermal or epithermal neutrons, though still [[fissionable]] with fast neutrons. The exception is [[uranium-233]] of the [[thorium cycle]], which has good capture-fission ratios at all neutron energies.

===High-energy neutrons===
High-energy neutrons have much more energy than fission energy neutrons and are generated as secondary particles by [[particle accelerator]]s or in the atmosphere from [[cosmic ray]]s. These high-energy neutrons are extremely efficient at [[ionization]] and far more likely to cause [[cell (biology)|cell]] death than [[X-ray]]s or protons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://medicalphysicsweb.org/cws/article/research/34364 |title= Facing up to secondary neutrons |accessdate= 2011-02-08 |author= Freeman, Tami |date= May 23, 2008 |publisher= Medical Physics Web |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20101220151101/http://medicalphysicsweb.org/cws/article/research/34364 |archive-date= 2010-12-20 |dead-url= yes |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title= Expand+Overview of secondary neutron production relevant to shielding in space |journal= Radiation Protection Dosimetry |year= 2005 |volume= 116 |issue= 1–4 |pages= 140–143 |doi=10.1093/rpd/nci033 |pmid= 16604615 |last1= Heilbronn |first1= L. |last2= Nakamura |first2= T |last3= Iwata |first3= Y |last4= Kurosawa |first4= T |last5= Iwase |first5= H |last6= Townsend |first6= LW}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nimo''' was the trademark of a family of very small non-standard [[cathode ray tube|CRTs]] manufactured by Industrial Electronics Engineers around mid-1960s, with 10 electron guns with [[stencil]]s which shaped the electron beam as digits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Electronic Design|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ed4EAQAAIAAJ|year=1971|publisher=Hayden Publishing Company}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=EEE.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Lv06AAAAMAAJ|date=July 1968|publisher=Mactier Publishing Corporation}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Nimo tube operated on a similar principle as the [[charactron]], but used a much simpler design. They were intended as single digit, simple displays, or as 4 or 6 digits by means of a special horizontal magnetic deflection system. Having only 3 electrode types (a filament, an anode and 10 different grids), the driving circuit for this tube was very simple, and as the image was projected on the glass face, it allowed a much wider viewing angle than for example [[nixie tube]]s which Nimo tried to replace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tube-tester.com/sites/nixie/dat_arch/BA0000-P31.pdf |title= IEE: ''Nimo 10-gun readout'' data sheet |format=PDF |accessdate=24 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tube required 1750 volts DC for the anode and also required 1.1 volts AC for the filaments as well as a cathode bias for the filaments. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Nimo display tubes catalog no 808, March 1969 |url=http://lampes-et-tubes.info/cd/nimo_display_tubes.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Nuclear Energy Agency''' ('''NEA''') is an intergovernmental agency that is organized under the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD).  Originally formed on 1 February 1958 with the name  '''European Nuclear Energy Agency''' ('''ENEA''')—the [[United States]] participated as an Associate Member—the name was changed on 20 April 1972 to its current name after [[Japan]] became a member.

The mission of the NEA is to ''"assist its member countries in maintaining and further developing, through international co-operation, the scientific, technological and legal bases required for the safe, environmentally friendly and economical use of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes."''&amp;nbsp;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oecd-nea.org/nea/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Members ==
NEA currently consists of 33 countries from Europe, North America and the Asia-Pacific region. In 2017 Argentina and Romania accessioned to NEA as its most recent members.&lt;ref&gt;https://seenews.com/news/romania-to-join-oecd-nuclear-energy-agency-in-june-569290&lt;/ref&gt;

Together they account for approximately 85% of the world’s installed nuclear capacity. Nuclear power accounts for almost a quarter of the electricity produced in NEA Member countries. The NEA works closely with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) in Vienna and with the European Commission in Brussels.

Within the OECD, there is close co-ordination with the International Energy Agency and the Environment Directorate, as well as contacts with other directorates, as appropriate.

== Structure ==

Since 1 September 2014, the Director-General of the NEA is William D Magwood, IV, who replaced [[Luis E. Echávarri]] on this post. The NEA Secretariat serves seven specialised standing technical committees under the leadership of the Steering Committee for Nuclear Energy{{spaced ndash}}the governing body of the NEA{{spaced ndash}}which reports directly to the OECD Council.

The standing technical committees, representing each of the seven major areas of the Agency's programme, are composed of member country experts who are both contributors to the programme of work and beneficiaries of its results. The approach is highly cost-efficient as it enables the Agency to pursue an ambitious programme with a relatively small staff that co-ordinates the work. The substantive value of the standing technical committees arises from the numerous important functions they perform, including: providing a forum for in-depth exchanges of technical and programmatic information; stimulating development of useful information by initiating and carrying out co-operation/research on key problems;  developing common positions, including "consensus opinions", on technical and policy issues; identifying areas where further work is needed and ensuring that NEA activities respond to real needs; organising joint projects to enable interested countries to carry out research on particular issues on a cost-sharing basis.

'''Nuclear fission products''' are the atomic fragments left after a large atomic nucleus undergoes [[nuclear fission]]. Typically, a large [[atomic nucleus|nucleus]] like that of [[uranium]] fissions by splitting into two smaller nuclei, along with a few [[neutron]]s, the release of heat energy ([[kinetic energy]] of the nuclei), and [[gamma ray]]s. The two smaller nuclei are the ''fission products''. (See also [[Fission products (by element)]]).

About 0.2% to 0.4% of fissions are [[ternary fission]]s, producing a third light nucleus such as [[helium-4]] (90%) or [[tritium]] (7%).

The fission products themselves are usually unstable and therefore radioactive; due to being relatively neutron-rich for their atomic number, many of them quickly undergo [[beta decay]].  This releases additional energy in the form of [[beta particle]]s, [[antineutrino]]s, and [[gamma ray]]s.  Thus, fission events normally result in beta and gamma radiation, even though this radiation is not produced directly by the fission event itself.

The produced [[nuclides|radionuclides]] have varying [[half-life|half-lives]], and therefore vary in [[Radioactive decay|radioactivity]]. For instance, [[Isotopes of strontium|strontium-89]] and  strontium-90 are produced in similar quantities in fission, and each nucleus decays by [[beta particle|beta]] emission.  But &lt;sup&gt;90&lt;/sup&gt;Sr has a 30-year half-life, and &lt;sup&gt;89&lt;/sup&gt;Sr a 50.5-day half-life. Thus in the 50.5 days it takes half the &lt;sup&gt;89&lt;/sup&gt;Sr atoms to decay, emitting the same number of beta particles as there were decays, less than 0.4% of the &lt;sup&gt;90&lt;/sup&gt;Sr atoms have decayed, emitting only 0.4% of the betas.  The radioactive emission rate is highest for the shortest lived radionuclides, although they also decay the fastest. Additionally, less stable fission products are less likely to decay to stable nuclides, instead decaying to other radionuclides, which undergo further decay and radiation emission, adding to the radiation output.  It is these short lived fission products that are the immediate hazard of spent fuel, and the energy output of the radiation also generates significant heat which must be considered when storing spent fuel.  As there are hundreds of different radionuclides created, the initial radioactivity level fades quickly as short lived radionuclides decay, but never ceases completely as longer lived radionuclides make up more and more of the remaining unstable atoms.&lt;ref&gt;F. William Walker, Dr. George J. Kirouac, Francis M. Rourke. 1977. ''Chart of the Nuclides'', twelfth edition. Knolls Atomic Power Laboratory, General Electric Company.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Formation and decay ==
The sum of the [[atomic mass]] of the two atoms produced by the fission of one [[fissile]] [[atom]] is always less than the atomic mass of the original atom. This is because some of the mass is lost as free [[neutron]]s, and once kinetic energy of the fission products has been removed (i.e., the products have been cooled to extract the heat provided by the reaction), then the mass associated with this energy is lost to the system also, and thus appears to be "missing" from the cooled fission products.

Since the nuclei that can readily undergo fission are particularly neutron-rich (e.g. 61% of the [[nucleon]]s in [[uranium-235]] are neutrons), the initial fission products are often more neutron-rich than stable nuclei of the same mass as the fission product (e.g. stable [[zirconium]]-90 is 56% neutrons compared to unstable [[strontium]]-90 at 58%). The initial fission products therefore may be unstable and typically undergo [[beta decay]]  to move towards a stable configuration, converting a neutron to a [[proton]] with each beta emission. (Fission products do not decay via [[alpha decay]].)

A few neutron-rich and short-lived initial fission products decay by ordinary beta decay (this is the source of perceptible half life, typically a few tenths of a second to a few seconds), followed by immediate emission of a neutron by the excited daughter-product. This process is the source of so-called [[delayed neutron]]s, which play an important role in control of a [[nuclear reactor]].

The first beta decays are rapid and may release high energy [[beta particle]]s or [[gamma radiation]]. However, as the fission products approach stable nuclear conditions, the last one or two decays may have a long [[half-life]] and release less energy.

==Radioactivity over time==
Fission products have half-lives of 90 years ([[samarium-151]]) or less, except for seven [[long-lived fission product]]s that have half lives of 211,100 years ([[technetium-99]]) and more. Therefore, the total radioactivity of a mixture of pure fission products decreases rapidly for the first several hundred years (controlled by the short-lived products) before stabilizing at a low level that changes little for hundreds of thousands of years (controlled by the seven long-lived products).

This behavior of pure fission products with actinides removed, contrasts with the decay of fuel that still contains [[actinides]]. This fuel is produced in the so-called "open" (i.e., no [[nuclear reprocessing]]) [[nuclear fuel cycle]]. A number of these actinides have half lives in the missing range of about 100 to 200,000 years, causing some difficulty with storage plans in this time-range for open cycle non-reprocessed fuels.

Proponents of nuclear fuel cycles which aim to consume all their actinides by fission, such as the [[Integral Fast Reactor]] and [[molten salt reactor]], use this fact to claim that within 200 years, their fuel wastes are no more radioactive than the original [[uranium ore]].&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20071009064447/http://www.nuc.berkeley.edu/designs/ifr/anlw.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Fission products emit [[beta radiation]], while actinides primarily emit [[alpha radiation]]. Many of each also emit [[gamma radiation]].

== Yield ==
{{Main article|Fission product yield}}

[[Image:ThermalFissionYield.svg|thumb|350px|Fission product yields by mass for [[thermal neutron]] fission of [[Uranium-235|U-235]], [[Pu-239]], a combination of the two typical of current nuclear power reactors, and [[Uranium-233|U-233]] used in the [[thorium cycle]].]]

Each fission of a parent atom produces a different set of fission product atoms.  However, while an individual fission is not predictable, the fission products are statistically predictable.  The amount of any particular isotope produced per fission is called its yield, typically expressed as percent per parent fission; therefore, yields total to just over 200% (because of [[ternary fission]]s), not 100%.

While fission products include every element from [[zinc]] through the [[lanthanides]], the majority of the fission products occur in two peaks. One peak occurs at about (expressed by atomic number) [[strontium]] to [[ruthenium]] while the other peak is at about [[tellurium]] to [[neodymium]].  The yield is somewhat dependent on the parent atom and also on the energy of the initiating neutron.

In general the higher the energy of the state that undergoes nuclear fission, the more likely that the two fission products have similar mass.  Hence as the neutron energy increases and/or the energy of the [[fissile]] atom increases, the valley between the two peaks becomes more shallow.&lt;ref&gt;http://prola.aps.org/abstract/PR/v75/i1/p17_1&lt;/ref&gt;
For instance, the curve of yield against mass for [[Pu-239]] has a more shallow valley than that observed for [[Uranium-235|U-235]] when the neutrons are [[thermal neutron]]s. The curves for the fission of the later [[actinides]] tend to make even more shallow valleys. In extreme cases such as [[fermium-259|&lt;sup&gt;259&lt;/sup&gt;Fm]], only one peak is seen.

The adjacent figure shows a typical fission product distribution from the fission of uranium. Note that in the calculations used to make this graph, the activation of fission products was ignored and the fission was assumed to occur in a single moment rather than a length of time. In this bar chart results are shown for different cooling times — time after fission.
Because of the stability of nuclei with even numbers of protons and/or neutrons, the curve of yield against element is not a smooth curve but tends to alternate. Note that the curve against mass number is smooth.&lt;ref name="Nuclear Fission Yield "&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.science.uwaterloo.ca/~cchieh/cact/nuctek/fissionyield.html|title=Nuclear Fission Yield |accessdate=2009-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Production ==
Small amounts of fission products are naturally formed as the result of either [[spontaneous fission]] of natural uranium, which occurs at a low rate, or as a result of neutrons from [[radioactive decay]] or reactions with [[cosmic ray]] particles.  The microscopic tracks left by these fission products in some natural minerals (mainly [[apatite]] and  [[zircon]]) are used in [[fission track dating]] to provide the cooling (crystallization) ages of natural rocks.  The technique has an effective [[absolute dating|dating]] range of 0.1 Ma to &gt;1.0 Ga depending on the mineral used and the concentration of uranium in that mineral.

About 1.5 billion years ago in a uranium ore body in Africa, a [[natural nuclear fission reactor]] operated for a few hundred thousand years and produced approximately 5 tonnes of fission products.  These fission products were important in providing proof that the natural reactor had occurred.
Fission products are produced in [[nuclear weapon]] explosions, with the amount depending on the type of weapon.
The largest source of fission products is from [[nuclear reactor]]s.  In current [[nuclear power]] reactors, about 3% of the uranium in the fuel is converted into fission products as a by-product of energy generation.  Most of these fission products remain in the fuel unless there is [[fuel element failure]] or a [[nuclear accident]], or the fuel is [[nuclear reprocessing|reprocessed]].

=== Power reactors ===
{{see also|Spent nuclear fuel}}
In commercial [[nuclear reactor|nuclear fission reactor]]s, the system is operated in the otherwise self-extinguishing [[Nuclear_reactor_physics#Delayed_neutrons_and_controllability|prompt subcritical]] state. The reactor specific physical phenomena that nonetheless maintains the temperature above the [[decay heat]] level, are the predictably delayed,&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://www.nuceng.ca/ep6p3/class/Module3B_ReactorKineticsJun21.pdf Elementary physics of reactor control, Reactor kinetics]&lt;/ref&gt; and therefore easily controlled, transformations or movements of a vital class of fission product, or reaction ember, as they decay,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nuclear-power.net/nuclear-power/fission/ Delayed neutrons are emitted by neutron rich fission fragments that are called the delayed neutron precursors.]&lt;/ref&gt; with [[Bromine-87]] being one such long-lived "ember", with a half-life of about a minute and thus it emits a ''delayed'' neutron upon decay.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nuclearpowertraining.tpub.com/h1019v1/css/Prompt-And-Delayed-Neutrons-133.htm PROMPT AND DELAYED NEUTRONS]&lt;/ref&gt;  Operating in this [[Nuclear reactor physics|delayed critical]] state, the dependence on the inherently delayed transformation or movement of fission products/[[ember]]s to maintain the temperature, is a process that occurs slow enough to permit human feedback on the temperature control. In an analogous manner to [[fire damper]]s varying the opening to control the movement of wood embers towards new fuel, [[control rod]]s are comparatively varied up or down, as the nuclear [[burnup|fuel burns up]] over time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nuclear-power.net/nuclear-power/fission/prompt-neutrons/ Prompt and Delayed Neutrons ''The fact the neutron is produced via this type of decay and this happens orders of magnitude later compared to the emission of the prompt neutrons, plays an extremely important role in the control of the reactor.'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.clpgroup.com/NuclearEnergy/Eng/science/science3_1_1.aspx "In view of the very low concentration of Uranium used, it is not possible for a commercial nuclear reactor to explode like an atomic bomb from the perspective of physics. A good analogy would be to compare alcoholic spirits to beer. Alcoholic spirits, such as Vodka, typically have a 40% alcohol content, and are highly flammable. Beer, which generally has an alcohol content of less than 5%, does not burn."]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metamia.com/analogize.php?q=nuclear METAMIA is a free database of analogy and metaphor.]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nuclearconnect.org/know-nuclear/talking-nuclear/top-10-myths-about-nuclear-energy nuclear education for K-12 students Myths About Nuclear Energy  ''It is impossible for a reactor to explode like a nuclear weapon; these weapons contain very special materials in very particular configurations, neither of which are present in a nuclear reactor''.]&lt;/ref&gt;

In a nuclear power reactor, the main sources of radioactivity are fission products, alongside [[actinide]]s and [[activation product]]s.  Fission products are the largest source of radioactivity for the first several hundred years, while actinides are dominant roughly 10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; to 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; years after fuel use.

Fission occurs in the nuclear fuel, and the fission products are primarily retained within the fuel close to where they are produced.  These fission products are important to the operation of the reactor because some fission products contribute delayed neutrons that are useful for reactor control while others are neutron poisons that tend to inhibit the nuclear reaction.  The buildup of the fission product poisons is a key factor in determining [[burnup|the maximum duration a given fuel element can be kept within the reactor]].  The decay of short-lived fission products also provide a source of heat within the fuel that continues even after the reactor has been shut down and the fission reactions stopped.  It is this [[decay heat]] that sets the requirements for cooling of a reactor after shutdown.

If the fuel [[Cladding (nuclear fuel)|cladding]] around the fuel develops holes, then fission products can leak into the primary [[coolant]]. Depending on the fission product chemistry, it may settle within the [[reactor core]] or travel through the coolant system.  Coolant systems include chemistry control systems that tend to remove such fission products. In a well-designed power reactor running under normal conditions, the radioactivity of the coolant is very low.

It is known that the isotope responsible for the majority of the gamma exposure in [[nuclear reprocessing|fuel reprocessing]] plants (and the Chernobyl site in 2005) is [[Cs-137]]. [[Iodine-129]] is one of the major radioactive elements released from reprocessing plants. In nuclear reactors both Cs-137 and [[strontium-90]] are found in locations remote from the [[fuel]].  This is because these isotopes are formed by the [[beta decay]] of [[noble gas]]es ([[xenon-137]] {halflife of 3.8 minutes} and [[krypton-90]] {halflife 32 seconds}) which enable these isotopes to be deposited in locations remote from the fuel (e.g. on [[control rod]]s).

==== Nuclear reactor poisons ====
{{Main article|Nuclear poison|Iodine pit}}
Some fission products decay with the release of a neutron.  Since there may be a short delay in time between the original fission event (which releases its own [[prompt neutron]]s immediately) and the release of these neutrons, the latter are termed "[[delayed neutron]]s".  These delayed neutrons are important to nuclear reactor control.

Some of the fission products, such as [[xenon-135]] and [[samarium-149]], have a high neutron absorption [[Neutron cross section|cross section]]. Since a nuclear reactor depends on a balance in the neutron production and absorption rates, those fission products that remove neutrons from the reaction will tend to shut the reactor down or "poison" the reactor. Nuclear fuels and reactors are designed to address this phenomenon through such features as burnable poisons and control rods. Build-up of xenon-135 during shutdown or low-power operation may poison the reactor enough to [[iodine pit|impede restart]] or to interfere with normal control of the reaction during restart or restoration of full power, possibly causing or contributing to an [[Chernobyl disaster#Experiment and explosion|accident scenario]].

=== Nuclear weapons ===
[[Nuclear weapon]]s use fission as either the partial or the main energy source.  Depending on the weapon design and where it is exploded, the relative importance of the fission product radioactivity will vary compared to the activation product radioactivity in the total fallout radioactivity.

The immediate fission products from nuclear weapon fission are essentially the same as those from any other fission source, depending slightly on the particular nuclide that is fissioning.  However, the very short time scale for the reaction makes a difference in the particular mix of isotopes produced from an atomic bomb.

For example, the &lt;sup&gt;134&lt;/sup&gt;Cs/&lt;sup&gt;137&lt;/sup&gt;Cs ratio provides an easy method of distinguishing between fallout from a bomb and the fission products from a power reactor. Almost no [[Cs-134]] is formed by nuclear fission (because [[xenon]]-134 is stable). The &lt;sup&gt;134&lt;/sup&gt;Cs is formed by the [[neutron activation]] of the stable &lt;sup&gt;133&lt;/sup&gt;Cs which is formed by the decay of isotopes in the [[isobar (nuclide)|isobar]] (A = 133). So in a momentary criticality by the time that the [[neutron]] flux becomes zero too little time will have passed for any &lt;sup&gt;133&lt;/sup&gt;Cs to be present. While in a power reactor plenty of time exists for the decay of the isotopes in the [[isobar (nuclide)|isobar]] to form &lt;sup&gt;133&lt;/sup&gt;Cs, the &lt;sup&gt;133&lt;/sup&gt;Cs thus formed can then be activated to form &lt;sup&gt;134&lt;/sup&gt;Cs only if the time between the start and the end of the criticality is long.

According to Jiri Hala's textbook,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Radioactivity, Ionizing Radiation, and Nuclear Energy
 |last=Hala |first=Jiri |authorlink= |author2=James D. Navratil  |year=2003 |publisher=Konvoj |location=Brno |isbn=80-7302-053-X |page= |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the radioactivity in the fission product mixture in an [[atom bomb]] is mostly caused by short-lived isotopes such as [[Iodine-131|I-131]] and [[Barium|Ba]]-140. After about four months [[Cerium|Ce]]-141, [[Zirconium|Zr]]-95/[[Niobium|Nb]]-95, and [[Strontium|Sr]]-89 represent the largest share of radioactive material. After two to three years, [[Cerium|Ce]]-144/[[Praseodymium|Pr]]-144, [[Ruthenium|Ru]]-106/[[Rhodium|Rh]]-106, and [[Promethium-147]] are the bulk of the radioactivity. After a few years, the radiation is dominated by [[strontium-90]] and [[caesium-137]], whereas in the period between 10,000 and a million years it is [[technetium]]-99 that dominates.

===Application===
Some fission products (such as [[Cs-137]]) are used in medical and industrial [[radioactive source]]s.
&lt;sup&gt;99&lt;/sup&gt;TcO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; ion can react with steel surfaces to form a [[Passivation (chemistry)|corrosion resistant layer]]. In this way these metaloxo anions act as [[anode|anodic]] [[corrosion inhibitor]]s - it renders the steel surface passive. The formation of [[technetium(IV) oxide|&lt;sup&gt;99&lt;/sup&gt;TcO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] on [[steel]] surfaces is one effect which will retard the release of &lt;sup&gt;99&lt;/sup&gt;Tc from [[nuclear waste]] drums and nuclear equipment which has become lost prior to [[decontamination]] (e.g. [[nuclear submarine]] reactors which have been lost at sea).

In a similar way the release of radio-iodine in a serious power reactor accident could be retarded by [[adsorption]] on metal surfaces within the nuclear plant.&lt;ref&gt;H. Glänneskog.

== Decay ==

[[Image:AirDoseChernobylVector.svg|thumb|300px|The portion of the total radiation dose (in air) contributed by each isotope versus time after the [[Chernobyl disaster]], at the site thereof. Note that this image was drawn using data from the OECD report, and the second edition of 'The radiochemical manual'.&lt;ref name="Nuclear Data Evaluation Lab"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://atom.kaeri.re.kr/|title=Nuclear Data Evaluation Lab|accessdate=2009-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

For fission of [[uranium-235]], the predominant radioactive fission products include isotopes of [[iodine]], [[caesium]], [[strontium]], [[xenon]] and [[barium]]. The threat becomes smaller with the passage of time. Locations where radiation fields once posed immediate mortal threats, such as much of the [[Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant]] on day one of the [[Chernobyl disaster|accident]] and the [[ground zero]] sites of [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|U.S. atomic bombings in Japan]] (6 hours after detonation) are now relatively safe because the radioactivity has decayed to a low level.
Many of the fission products decay through very short-lived isotopes to form [[stable isotope]]s, but a considerable number of the [[radioisotope]]s have [[half-life|half-lives]] longer than a day.

The radioactivity in the fission product mixture is initially mostly caused by short lived isotopes such as [[Iodine-131]] and &lt;sup&gt;140&lt;/sup&gt;Ba; after about four months &lt;sup&gt;141&lt;/sup&gt;Ce, &lt;sup&gt;95&lt;/sup&gt;Zr/&lt;sup&gt;95&lt;/sup&gt;Nb and &lt;sup&gt;89&lt;/sup&gt;Sr take the largest share, while after about two or three years the largest share is taken by &lt;sup&gt;144&lt;/sup&gt;Ce/&lt;sup&gt;144&lt;/sup&gt;Pr, &lt;sup&gt;106&lt;/sup&gt;Ru/&lt;sup&gt;106&lt;/sup&gt;Rh and &lt;sup&gt;147&lt;/sup&gt;Pm. Later &lt;sup&gt;90&lt;/sup&gt;Sr and &lt;sup&gt;137&lt;/sup&gt;Cs are the main radioisotopes, being succeeded by &lt;sup&gt;99&lt;/sup&gt;Tc. In the case of a release of radioactivity from a power reactor or used fuel, only some elements are released; as a result, the isotopic signature of the radioactivity is very different from an open air [[nuclear detonation]], where all the fission products are dispersed.

== Fallout countermeasures ==
The purpose of radiological emergency preparedness is to protect people from the effects of radiation exposure after a nuclear accident or bomb. [[emergency evacuation|Evacuation]] is the most effective protective measure. However, if evacuation is impossible or even uncertain, then local [[fallout shelters]] and other measures provide the best protection.&lt;ref&gt;C. Kearney, Nuclear War Survival Skills, Oregon Institute of Science and Medicine, http://www.oism.org/&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!--REPETITIVE. AND DEADLINKED...The mixture of radioactive fission products found in the [[nuclear fallout|fallout]] from a [[nuclear bomb]] are very different in nature to those found in spent power [[Nuclear reactor technology|reactor]] fuel. This is because the reactor fuel will have had more time for the short lived isotopes to decay, and because for many accident types the volatile elements are liberated while the [[refractory|involatiles]] are retained at the accident site. As a result the contribution of many short-lived (e.g. &lt;sup&gt;97&lt;/sup&gt;Zr) and/or involatiles is less for accident fallout than it is bomb fallout.  A definitive report on Chernobyl is at [http://www.nea.fr/html/rp/chernobyl/allchernobyl.html] - Chapter 2, Table 1 lists the radioisotopes released in the fire. The percentage of the inventory which was released was controlled largely by how volatile the fission product is. Hence a greater proportion of [[xenon]] and [[iodine]] were released than of [[cerium]] and [[plutonium]].

For the longer term response, a review of the methods that can be used to decontaminate an urban environment is provided in the scope report [http://www.icsu-scope.org/downloadpubs/scope50/chapter06.html Behaviour and Decontamination of Artificial Radionuclides in the Urban Environment].

=== Iodine ===
[[Image:US fallout exposure.png|right|250px|thumb|Per capita thyroid doses in the continental United States of [[iodine-131]] resulting from all exposure routes from all atmospheric nuclear tests conducted at the [[Nevada Test Site]]. See also [[Downwinders]].]]
At least three [[isotopes of iodine]] are important. [[Iodine-129|&lt;sup&gt;129&lt;/sup&gt;I]], [[Iodine-131|&lt;sup&gt;131&lt;/sup&gt;I]] (radioiodine) and &lt;sup&gt;132&lt;/sup&gt;I. Open air [[nuclear test]]ing and the [[Chernobyl disaster]] both released iodine-131.

The short-lived [[isotope]]s of iodine are particularly harmful because the [[thyroid]] collects and concentrates [[iodide]] – radioactive as well as stable. Absorption of radioiodine can lead to acute, chronic, and delayed effects. Acute effects from high doses include [[thyroiditis]], while chronic and delayed effects include [[hypothyroidism]], [[thyroid nodule]]s, and [[thyroid cancer]]. It has been shown that the active iodine released from [[Chernobyl disaster|Chernobyl]] and [[Kyshtym Disaster|Mayak]]&lt;ref&gt;G. Mushkacheva, E. Rabinovich, V. Privalov, S. Povolotskaya, V. Shorokhova, S. Sokolova, V. Turdakova, E. Ryzhova, P. Hall, A. B. Schneider, D. L. Preston, and E. Ron, "Thyroid Abnormalities Associated with Protracted Childhood Exposure to 131I from Atmospheric Emissions from the Mayak Weapons Facility in Russia", ''Radiation Research'', 2006, '''166'''(5), 715-722&lt;/ref&gt; has resulted in an increase in the incidence of thyroid cancer in the former [[Soviet Union]].

One measure which protects against the risk from radio-iodine is taking a dose of [[potassium iodide]] (KI) before exposure to radioiodine.  The non-radioactive iodide 'saturates' the thyroid, causing less of the radioiodine to be stored in the body.
Administering potassium iodide reduces the effects of radio-iodine by 99% and is a prudent, inexpensive supplement to [[fallout shelter]]s. A low-cost alternative to commercially available iodine pills is a [[saturated solution]] of potassium iodide. Long-term storage of KI is normally in the form of [[Reagent#Reagent grade|reagent grade]] crystals.&lt;ref&gt;C. Kearney, Nuclear War Survival Skills (Ch. 13), Oregon Institute of Science and Medicine, http://www.oism.org/&lt;/ref&gt;

The administration of known [[goitrogen]] substances can also be used as a [[prophylaxis]] in reducing the bio-uptake of iodine, (whether it be the nutritional non-radioactive [[iodine-127]] or radioactive iodine, radioiodine - most commonly [[iodine-131]], as the body cannot discern between different iodine [[isotopes]]).
[[Perchlorate]] ions, a common water contaminant in the USA due to the [[aerospace industry]], has been shown to reduce iodine uptake and thus is classified as a [[goitrogen]]. Perchlorate ions are a competitive inhibitor of the process by which iodide is actively deposited into thyroid follicular cells. Studies involving healthy adult volunteers determined that at levels above 0.007 milligrams per kilogram per day (mg/(kg·d)), perchlorate begins to temporarily inhibit the thyroid gland’s ability to absorb iodine from the bloodstream ("iodide uptake inhibition", thus perchlorate is a known goitrogen).&lt;ref name="bare_url"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1289/ehp.02110927 |title=Health Effects Assessment for Environmental Perchlorate Contamination: The Dose Response for Inhibition of Thyroidal Radioiodine Uptake in Humans |year=2002 |last1=Greer |first1=Monte A. |last2=Goodman |first2=Gay |last3=Pleus |first3=Richard C. |last4=Greer |first4=Susan E. |journal=Environmental Health Perspectives |volume=110 |issue=9 |pages=927–37 |pmid=12204829 |pmc=1240994}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The reduction of the iodide pool by perchlorate has dual effects – reduction of excess hormone synthesis and hyperthyroidism, on the one hand, and reduction of thyroid inhibitor synthesis and hypothyroidism on the other. Perchlorate remains very useful as a single dose application in tests measuring the discharge of radioiodide accumulated in the thyroid as a result of many different disruptions in the further metabolism of iodide in the thyroid gland.&lt;ref name="ncbi"&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=9549759 |year=1998 |last1=Wolff |first1=J |title=Perchlorate and the thyroid gland |volume=50 |issue=1 |pages=89–105 |journal=Pharmacological Reviews}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Treatment of thyrotoxicosis (including Graves' disease) with 600-2,000&amp;nbsp;mg potassium perchlorate (430-1,400&amp;nbsp;mg perchlorate) daily for periods of several months or longer was once common practice, particularly in Europe,&lt;ref name="bare_url" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=4290684 |year=1966 |last1=Barzilai |first1=D |last2=Sheinfeld |first2=M |title=Fatal complications following use of potassium perchlorate in thyrotoxicosis. Report of two cases and a review of the literature |volume=2 |issue=4 |pages=453–6 |journal=Israel journal of medical sciences}}&lt;/ref&gt; and perchlorate use at lower doses to treat thryoid problems continues to this day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s00108-005-1508-4 |title=Therapie und Prävention der Hyperthyreose |trans-title=Therapy and prevention of hyperthyroidism |language=German |year=2005 |last1=Woenckhaus |first1=U. |last2=Girlich |first2=C. |journal=Der Internist |volume=46 |issue=12 |pages=1318–23 |pmid=16231171}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although 400&amp;nbsp;mg of potassium perchlorate divided into four or five daily doses was used initially and found effective, higher doses were introduced when 400&amp;nbsp;mg/day was discovered not to control thyrotoxicosis in all subjects.&lt;ref name="bare_url" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ncbi" /&gt;

Current regimens for treatment of [[thyrotoxicosis]] (including Graves' disease), when a patient is exposed to additional sources of iodine, commonly include 500&amp;nbsp;mg potassium perchlorate twice per day for 18–40 days.&lt;ref name="bare_url" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ncbi_a"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1210/jc.81.8.2930 |title=Treatment of amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis, a difficult challenge: Results of a prospective study |year=1996 |last1=Bartalena |first1=L. |journal=Journal of Clinical Endocrinology &amp; Metabolism |volume=81 |issue=8 |pmid=8768854 |pages=2930–3 |last2=Brogioni |first2=S |last3=Grasso |first3=L |last4=Bogazzi |first4=F |last5=Burelli |first5=A |last6=Martino |first6=E}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prophylaxis with perchlorate-containing water at concentrations of 17 [[Parts per million|ppm]], which corresponds to 0.5&amp;nbsp;mg/kg-day personal intake, if one is 70&amp;nbsp;kg and consumes 2 litres of water per day, was found to reduce baseline radioiodine uptake by 67%&lt;ref name="bare_url" /&gt; This is equivalent to ingesting a total of just 35&amp;nbsp;mg of perchlorate ions per day. In another related study where subjects drank just 1 litre of perchlorate-containing water per day at a concentration of 10 ppm, i.e. daily 10&amp;nbsp;mg of perchlorate ions were ingested, an average 38% reduction in the uptake of iodine was observed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1089/10507250050137734 |title=The Effect of Short-Term Low-Dose Perchlorate on Various Aspects of Thyroid Function |year=2000 |last1=Lawrence |first1=J. E. |last2=Lamm |first2=S. H. |last3=Pino |first3=S. |last4=Richman |first4=K. |last5=Braverman |first5=L. E. |journal=Thyroid |volume=10 |issue=8 |pages=659–63 |pmid=11014310}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, when the average perchlorate absorption in perchlorate plant workers subjected to the highest exposure has been estimated as approximately 0.5&amp;nbsp;mg/kg-day, as in the above paragraph, a 67% reduction of iodine uptake would be expected. Studies of chronically exposed workers though have thus far failed to detect any abnormalities of thyroid function, including the uptake of iodine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1097/00043764-199904000-00006 |title=Thyroid Health Status of Ammonium Perchlorate Workers: A Cross-Sectional Occupational Health Study |year=1999 |last1=Lamm |first1=Steven H. |last2=Braverman |first2=Lewis E. |last3=Li |first3=Feng Xiao |last4=Richman |first4=Kent |last5=Pino |first5=Sam |last6=Howearth |first6=Gregory |journal=Journal of Occupational &amp; Environmental Medicine |volume=41 |issue=4 |pmid=10224590 |pages=248–60}}&lt;/ref&gt; this may well be attributable to sufficient daily exposure or intake of healthy iodine-127 among the workers and the short 8 hr [[biological half life]] of perchlorate in the body.&lt;ref name="bare_url" /&gt;

To completely block the uptake of iodine-131 by the purposeful addition of perchlorate ions to a populace's water supply, aiming at dosages of 0.5&amp;nbsp;mg/kg-day, or a water concentration of 17 ppm, would therefore be grossly inadequate at truly reducing radioiodine uptake. Perchlorate ion concentrations in a region's water supply would need to be much higher, at least 7.15&amp;nbsp;mg/kg of body weight per day, or a water concentration of 250 [[Parts per million|ppm]], assuming people drink 2 liters of water per day, to be truly beneficial to the population at preventing [[bioaccumulation]] when exposed to a radioiodine environment,&lt;ref name="bare_url" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ncbi_a" /&gt; independent of the availability of [[iodate]] or [[iodide]] drugs.

The continual distribution of perchlorate tablets or the addition of perchlorate to the water supply would need to continue for no less than 80–90 days, beginning immediately after the initial release of radioiodine was detected. After 80–90 days passed, released radioactive iodine-131 would have decayed to less than 0.1% of its initial quantity, at which time the danger from biouptake of iodine-131 is essentially over.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dummies.com/how-to/content/nuclear-chemistry-halflives-and-radioactive-dating.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In the event of a radioiodine release, the ingestion of prophylaxis potassium iodide, if available, or even iodate, would rightly take precedence over perchlorate administration, and would be the first line of defense in protecting the population from a radioiodine release. However, in the event of a radioiodine release too massive and widespread to be controlled by the limited stock of iodide and iodate prophylaxis drugs, then the addition of perchlorate ions to the water supply, or distribution of perchlorate tablets would serve as a cheap, efficacious, second line of defense against [[carcinogenic]] radioiodine bioaccumulation.

The ingestion of goitrogen drugs is, much like potassium iodide also not without its dangers, such as [[hypothyroidism]]. In all these cases however, despite the risks, the prophylaxis benefits of intervention with iodide, iodate, or perchlorate outweigh the serious cancer risk from radioiodine bioaccumulation in regions where radioiodine has sufficiently contaminated the environment.

=== Cesium ===
The Chernobyl accident released a large amount of [[isotopes of cesium|cesium isotopes]] which were dispersed over a wide area. &lt;sup&gt;137&lt;/sup&gt;Cs is an isotope which is of long-term concern as it remains in the top layers of soil.  Plants with shallow root systems tend to absorb it for many years. Hence grass and mushrooms can carry a considerable amount of &lt;sup&gt;137&lt;/sup&gt;Cs, which can be transferred to humans through the [[food chain]].

One of the best countermeasures in [[dairy farming]] against &lt;sup&gt;137&lt;/sup&gt;Cs is to mix up the soil by deeply ploughing the soil. This has the effect of putting the &lt;sup&gt;137&lt;/sup&gt;Cs out of reach of the shallow roots of the grass, hence the level of radioactivity in the grass will be lowered. Also the removal of top few centimeters of soil and its burial in a shallow trench will reduce the dose to humans and animals as the gamma [[photon]]s from &lt;sup&gt;137&lt;/sup&gt;Cs will be attenuated by their passage through the soil.  The deeper and more remote the trench is, the better the degree of protection.
[[Fertilizer]]s containing [[potassium]] can be used to dilute cesium and limit its uptake by plants.

In [[livestock]] farming, another countermeasure against &lt;sup&gt;137&lt;/sup&gt;Cs is to feed to animals [[prussian blue]]. This compound acts as an [[ion-exchanger]]. The [[cyanide]] is so tightly bonded to the iron that it is safe for a human to consume several grams of prussian blue per day. The prussian blue reduces the [[biological half-life]] (different from the [[half-life|nuclear half-life]]) of the cesium. The physical or nuclear half-life of &lt;sup&gt;137&lt;/sup&gt;Cs is about 30 years. Cesium in humans normally has a biological half-life of between one and four months. An added advantage of the prussian blue is that the cesium which is stripped from the animal in the droppings is in a form which is not available to plants. Hence it prevents the cesium from being recycled. The form of prussian blue required for the treatment of animals, including humans is a special grade.  Attempts to use the [[pigment]] grade used in [[paint]]s have not been successful.&lt;ref&gt;For further details of the use of prussian blue please see the [[IAEA]] report on the [[Goiânia accident]].[http://www-pub.iaea.org/MTCD/publications/PDF/Pub815_web.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Strontium ===
The addition of [[Agricultural lime|lime]] to soils which are poor in [[calcium]] can reduce the uptake of [[strontium]] by plants.  Likewise in areas where the soil is low in [[potassium]], the addition of a potassium fertilizer can discourage the uptake of cesium into plants. However such treatments with either lime or [[potash]] should not be undertaken lightly as they can alter the [[soil chemistry]] greatly, so resulting in a change in the plant [[ecology]] of the land.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

== Health concerns ==
For introduction of radionuclides into organism, ingestion is the most important route. Insoluble compounds are not absorbed from the gut and cause only local irradiation before they are excreted. Soluble forms however show wide range of absorption percentages.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=4HOGwg0YqwMC&amp;pg=PA35&amp;dq=radioactive+fallout+particles+zirconium&amp;lr=&amp;num=50&amp;as_brr=3&amp;cd=29#v=onepage&amp;q=radioactive%20fallout%20particles%20zirconium&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;

McGinley]] and [[R. Lee Ermey]]. It is, to date, Seagal's only directorial effort, and features a minor appearance by [[Billy Bob Thornton]] in one of his early roles.

''On Deadly Ground'' earned $38.6 million during its theatrical run, failing to bring back its reported $50 million budget and received negative reviews.

==Plot==
[[Aegis]] Oil operates Aegis 1, an [[oil refinery]] and several [[Drilling rig|oil rigs]] in [[Alaska]]. They purchased the oil rights from the local [[Alaskan Natives]] 20 years ago, but stand to lose them if the refinery isn’t on-line by a certain deadline. With 13 days to go, and billions of dollars at stake, the company cuts corners and uses faulty equipment.  Hugh Palmer, a rig foreman, is aware of this; as he predicts, his rig catches fire. It takes Forrest Taft (Seagal), a specialist in dealing with [[oil drilling]]-related fires, to extinguish the fire. Taft refuses to believe Hugh’s story of faulty equipment at first, but later discovers that it is true after accessing the company’s computer records and finding that the next shipments of new, adequate equipment have been delayed way past the deadline. Michael Jennings ([[Michael Caine]]), the ruthless CEO of Aegis, deludedly believes that Hugh's carelessness is to blame for the rig fire and, after discovering his efforts to alert the [[Environmental Protection Agency|EPA]] about the use of substandard equipment, arranges for him to be ‘dealt with’ by his henchmen MacGruder ([[John C. McGinley]]) and Otto ([[Sven-Ole Thorsen]]).

Jennings is alerted to Taft's activities and orders that Taft be eliminated as well. MacGruder and Otto brutally ransack Palmer's cabin for the evidence against Jennings, and torture and murder Palmer without finding it. Taft is set up for a trap by investigating a supposedly damaged pump station. He is badly wounded by an explosion, but survives and is rescued by Masu ([[Joan Chen]]), the daughter of Silook, the chief of her tribe.

MacGruder and Otto are unable to locate Taft's body, and Jennings assumes that he is still alive. Taft is being cared for by Silook's tribe. After unsuccessfully trying to leave using a [[dogsled]],  Silook has Taft undergo a [[vision quest]] in which he sees the truth. When made to choose between two women, Taft opts for the elderly, clothed grandmother, forgoing the erotically-charged nude [[Iñupiaq]] [[seductress]]. The grandmother warns Taft that time is running out for those who pollute the world. Taft realizes that his only option is to see the refinery closed. He takes off, with MacGruder and Otto hot on his trail.

At Silook's village, they demand to know where Taft is. Silook refuses to give the information and is fatally shot by MacGruder. Jennings berates MacGruder for killing Silook in front of his entire tribe. They bring in a group of New Orleans-based [[mercenary|mercenaries]] led by Stone ([[R. Lee Ermey]]) to finish off Taft before Aegis 1 can go on-line. They also have an [[FBI Counterterrorism Division|FBI Anti-Terrorist Unit]] at the refinery.

Accompanied by Masu, Taft (who is probably ex-CIA and an expert on sabotage and demolition), collects weapons and explosives and manages to enter the refinery complex, and begins to effectively sabotage the refinery. MacGruder (who is killed by Taft in the process of getting thrown into the helicopter's tail rotor blades for killing Hugh and Silook), Otto (who was killed earlier at Hugh's cabin), Stone (who is killed by Taft with his own shotgun when he confronts him at the platform) and Jennings’ ruthlessly efficient female assistant Liles (who crashes her truck into a gasoline tank in an escape attempt), are powerless to defeat him and are all killed in various gruesome ways; the FBI also pulls out, revealing in the process that Taft might be ex-CIA.
 
Taft and Masu confront Jennings, string him up, and drop him into a pool of oil, effectively drowning Jennings in his own wealth. They then escape as a series of explosions destroy the rest of Aegis 1.

As an epilogue, Taft, far from being arrested for sabotage and multiple murders (self defense), is asked to deliver a speech at the [[Alaska State Capitol]] about the dangers of oil pollution, and the companies that are endangering the ecosystem.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=edstar83|title=Steven Seagal On Deadly Ground. 1994  Ending Speech!|date=2010-07-10|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8B0np_o1VBg|accessdate=2017-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the speech they show a scene of one of the first commercial hydrogen fuel cell systems developed by Perry Energy Systems.

== Critical response ==
''On Deadly Ground'' has received negative reviews from critics. The film bears a 10% freshness rating on the review aggregate site [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on 30 reviews.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/on_deadly_ground/ ''On Deadly Ground''], [[Rotten Tomatoes]], accessed February 1, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Audiences polled by [[CinemaScore]] gave the film an average grade of "B+" on an A+ to F scale.&lt;ref name="CinemaScore"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://m.cinemascore.com |title=CinemaScore |work=cinemascore.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time of its release, [[Gene Siskel]] included the film in his "Worst of" list for 1994, singling out the melancholy tone of the film, and the quality of Seagal's dialogue.&lt;ref name="atm_review"&gt;[[Siskel, Gene]], [[Ebert, Robert]]. (1994). "Siskel and Ebert at the movies: Best and worst of 1994" [Television recording] Buena-Vista Entertainment Ltd&lt;/ref&gt; On their syndicated TV show [[At the Movies (1986 TV program)|Siskel &amp; Ebert]], Siskel called the film's pyrotechnics "low rent" and stated that he "didn't think the fight sequences were anything special." However, he noted that Seagal's speech at the end was "more interesting than the actual fighting." [[Roger Ebert]], for his part, called the speech "absurd" and "shameless" but opined that while "it doesn't pay to devote close attention to the plot," "if you like to see lots of stuff blowed up real good, this’d be a movie for you."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media |people= [[Siskel, Gene]], [[Ebert, Robert]]. |year=1994 |title= Siskel &amp; Ebert: Sugar Hill / On Deadly Ground / Eight Seconds (1994)|medium= TV |url= http://siskelandebert.org/video/SRGMG6R3XNSO/Sugar-Hill--On-Deadly-Ground--Eight-Seconds-1994 |accessdate= April 28, 2014 |time= 12:00 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The film is listed in [[Golden Raspberry]] Award founder John Wilson's book ''The Official Razzie Movie Guide'' as one of The 100 Most Enjoyably Bad Movies Ever Made.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wilson|first=John|title=The Official Razzie Movie Guide: Enjoying the Best of Hollywood's Worst |year=2005|publisher=Grand Central Publishing|isbn=0-446-69334-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' film critic Leonard Klady referred to the film as "a vanity production parading as a social statement" and commented that the film seemingly borrowed heavily from the earlier film, ''[[Billy Jack]]'' but opined that Seagal lacked "acting technique and the ability behind the camera to keep the story simple and direct" that ''Billy Jack'' star [[Tom Laughlin]], exhibited. Like Siskel, Klady also singled out the speech by Seagal's character at the end of the film.&lt;ref name="klady_variety"&gt;Klady, Leonard. [http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117902388.html?categoryid=31&amp;cs=1&amp;query=on+deadly+ground "On Deadly Ground Review"], ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'', February 21, 1994, accessed May 24, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harrington, Ricard.

''[[Seagalogy]]'' author Vern considers ''On Deadly Ground'' to be one of Seagal's defining works, writing, "It's the corniest, most unintentionally hilarious movie of his career... But it's also Seagal's most sincere and his most ballsy," going on to claim, "You can't understand Seagal if you haven't seen ''On Deadly Ground''." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Vern |date= March 2012 |title= Seagalogy: A Study of the Ass-Kicking Films of Steven Seagal |location=London |publisher=[[Titan Books]] |isbn=978-0857687227 |page=69 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He points out that many of the most important themes and [[motif (narrative)|motif]]s that define Seagal's work are present here more overtly than in any of his other films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Vern |date= March 2012 |title= Seagalogy: A Study of the Ass-Kicking Films of Steven Seagal |location=London |publisher=[[Titan Books]] |isbn=978-0857687227 |page=78 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''PETases''' are an [[esterase]] class of [[enzyme]]s that [[Catalysis|catalyze]] the [[hydrolysis]] of  poly (ethylene terephthalate) [[Polyethylene terephthalate|PET]] plastic to [[monomer]]ic [[2-Hydroxyethyl terephthalic acid|mono-2-hydroxyethyl terephthalate]] (MHET). The idealized chemical reaction is (where n is the number of [[monomer]]s in the [[polymer]] chain):&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

:(ethylene terephthalate)&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → (ethylene terephthalate)&lt;sub&gt;n-1&lt;/sub&gt; + MHET

Trace amount of the PET breaks down to [[Bis(2-Hydroxyethyl) terephthalate|bis(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalate]] (BHET). PETases can also break down PEF-plastic ([[Polyethylene 2,5-furandicarboxylate|polyethylene-2,5-furandicarboxylate]]), which is a bioderived PET replacement. PETases can't catalyze the hydrolysis of [[Aliphatic compound|aliphatic]] [[polyester]]s like [[polybutylene succinate]] or [[polylactic acid]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Austin HP, Allen MD, Donohoe BS, Rorrer NA, Kearns FL, Silveira RL, Pollard BC, Dominick G, Duman R, El Omari K, Mykhaylyk V, Wagner A, Michener WE, Amore A, Skaf MS, Crowley MF, Thorne AW, Johnson CW, Woodcock HL, McGeehan JE, Beckham GT | title = Characterization and engineering of a plastic-degrading aromatic polyesterase | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 115 | issue = 19 | pages = E4350-E4357 | date = May 2018 | pmid = 29666242 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1718804115 | }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The first PETase enzyme was discovered in 2016 from ''[[Ideonella sakaiensis]]'' strain 201-F6 [[bacteria]] found from sludge samples collected close to a Japanese PET bottle recycling site.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tanasupawat S, Takehana T, Yoshida S, Hiraga K, Oda K | title = Ideonella sakaiensis sp. nov., isolated from a microbial consortium that degrades poly(ethylene terephthalate) | journal = International Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology | volume = 66 | issue = 8 | pages = 2813–8 | date = August 2016 | pmid = 27045688 | doi = 10.1099/ijsem.0.001058 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Scientists suggested that the PETase enzyme may have had past enzymatic activity associated with degradation of a waxy coating on plants. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.livescience.com/62328-plastic-eating-enzyme.html|title=Lab 'Accident' Becomes Mutant Enzyme That Devours Plastic|work=Live Science|access-date=2018-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Normally the natural degradation of PET without PETase will take hundred of years. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-accidentally-engineered-mutant-enzyme-eats-through-plastic-pet-petase-pollution|title=Scientists Have Accidentally Created a Mutant Enzyme That Eats Plastic Waste|last=Dockrill|first=Peter|work=ScienceAlert|access-date=2018-11-27|language=en-gb}}&lt;/ref&gt;  PET (polyethylene terephthalate-plastics)is a very common source of many plastic items used in the daily life.

PETase hydrolyses PET (polyethylene terephthalate) into soluble building blocks due to reaction with water which is a bioconversion of plastics. &lt;ref&gt;Chan, Allison (2016). "The Future of Bacteria Cleaning Our Plastic Waste". https://cloudfront.escholarship.org/dist/prd/content/qt7xb0c7hr/qt7xb0c7hr.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; PET is a polymer composed of ester bond-linked terephthalate (TPA) and ethylene glycol (EG). A high molecular weight and other properties make PET a great utilizing plastic. By the hydrolysis reaction PET hydrolyzing enzymes decompose PET into building blocks which is helpful for the environment. During the hydrolyzing PET, the enzyme produces mono-(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalic acid (MHET), TPA ,and bis-2(hydroxyethyl) TPA (BHET). &lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The novel bacteria called ''Ideonella sakaieensis'' is isolating and it utilize PET as an energy and carbon source. The ''deonella sakaieensis'' sticks to the surface of PET  and keep a cutinase enzyme that allow PET to degrade. That reaction allows to degrade PET, and make it less harmful for the environment. 

==MHET breakdown in ''I. sakaiensis''==
MHET is broken down in ''I. sakaiensis'' by the action of [[MHETase]] enzyme to [[terephthalic acid]] and [[ethylene glycol]]. These are environmentally harmless as they are broken down further to produce [[carbon dioxide]] and water.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Yoshida S, Hiraga K, Takehana T, Taniguchi I, Yamaji H, Maeda Y, Toyohara K, Miyamoto K, Kimura Y, Oda K | title = A bacterium that degrades and assimilates poly(ethylene terephthalate) | journal = Science | volume = 351 | issue = 6278 | pages = 1196–9 | date = March 2016 | pmid = 26965627 | doi = 10.1126/science.aad6359 | url = http://science.sciencemag.org/content/351/6278/1196.long | lay-url = https://www.keio.ac.jp/en/press_releases/2016/cb96u90000005501-att/160330_2.pdf | lay-date = 2016-03-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''I. sakaiensis'' bacterium  adhere to the PET surface and release a unique enzyme, similar to cutinase, with the ability to degrade PET.

==Mutations==

In 2018 scientists from the University of Portsmouth with the collaboration of the National Renewable Energy Laboratory of the United States Department of Energy developed a mutant of this PETase that degrades PET faster than the one in its natural state. In this study it was also shown that PETases can degrade [[polyethylene 2,5-furandicarboxylate]] (PEF).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

There are approximately 69 PETase-like enzymes comprising a variety of diverse organisms, and there are two classifications of these enzymes including type I and type II. &lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; It is suggested that 57 enzymes fall into the type I category whereas the rest fall into the type II group, including the PETase enzyme found in the ''[[Ideonella sakaiensis]].'' Within all 69 PETase-like enzymes, there exists the same three residues within the active site, suggesting that the catalytic mechanism is the same in all forms of PETase-like enzymes.

'''''Pachyrhizus erosus''''', commonly known as '''jicama''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|h|ɪ|k|ə|m|ə}} or {{IPAc-en|dʒ|ɪ|ˈ|k|ɑː|m|ə}};&lt;ref&gt;''Collins English Dictionary – Complete and Unabridged, 12th Edition 2014''. S.v. "Jicama." Retrieved July 18, 2017 from http://www.thefreedictionary.com/jicama&lt;/ref&gt; Spanish ''jícama'' {{Audio-IPA|JicamaPronunciation.ogg|[ˈxikama]}}; from [[Nahuatl]] ''xīcamatl'', {{IPA-nah|ʃiːˈkamatɬ|}}), '''Mexican yam bean''', or '''Mexican turnip''', is the name of a native Mexican [[vine]], although the name most commonly refers to the plant's edible [[tuberous root]]. Jícama is a species in the genus ''[[Pachyrhizus]]'' in the bean family (Fabaceae). Plants in this genus are commonly referred to as '''yam bean''', although the term "yam bean" can be another name for jícama. The other major species of yam beans are also indigenous within the [[Americas]]. ''[http://pfaf.org/user/Plant.aspx?LatinName=Pachyrhizus+tuberosus Pachyrhizus tuberosus]'' and ''[http://pfaf.org/user/Plant.aspx?LatinName=Pachyrhizus+ahipa Pachyrhizus ahipa]'' are the other two cultivated species. The naming of this group of edible plants seems confused, with much overlap of similar or the same common names.

Flowers, either blue or white, and pods similar to lima beans, are produced on fully developed plants. Several species of jicama occur, but the one found in many markets is ''P. erosus''. The two cultivated forms of ''P. erosus'' are ''jicama de agua'' and ''jicama de leche'', both named for the consistency of their juice. The ''leche'' form has an elongated root and milky juice, while the ''agua'' form has a top-shaped to oblate root and a more watery, translucent juice, and is the preferred form for market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Johnson|first=Hunter|title=Extension Vegetable Specialist|url=http://sfp.ucdavis.edu/pubs/brochures/Jicama/|publisher=UC-Davis}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bhasin"&gt;{{cite web|title=Globalization of Foods-Jicama|url=http://globalbhasin.blogspot.com/2012/07/globalization-of-foods-jicama.html|publisher=Global Bhasin|accessdate=31 July 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140111023059/http://globalbhasin.blogspot.com/2012/07/globalization-of-foods-jicama.html|archivedate=11 January 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Botany ==

Other names for jicama include Mexican potato, ''ahipa'', ''saa got'', Chinese potato, and [[turnip (terminology)|sweet turnip]]. In Ecuador and Peru, the name ''jicama'' is used for the unrelated ''[[yacón]]'' or Peruvian ground apple, a plant of the sunflower family whose tubers are also used as food.&lt;ref name="Bhasin" /&gt;
[[File:Pachyrhizus erosus 2.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Fresh jícama for sale at a farmers' market]]
The jícama vine can reach a height of 4–5&amp;nbsp;m given suitable support. Its root can attain lengths up to 2&amp;nbsp;m and weigh up to 20&amp;nbsp;kg. The heaviest jícama root ever recorded weighed 23&amp;nbsp;kg and was found in 2010 in the Philippines (where they are called ''singkamas'').&lt;ref name="heavy" /&gt;
Jicama is frost-tender and requires 9 months without frost for a good harvest of large tubers or to grow it commercially. It is worth growing in cooler areas that have at least 5 months without frost, as it will still produce tubers, but they will be smaller.
Warm, temperate areas with at least 5 months without frost can start seed 8 to 10 weeks before the last spring frost. Bottom heat is recommended, as the seeds require warm temperatures to germinate, so the pots will need to be kept in a warm place. Jicama is unsuitable for areas with a short growing season unless cultured in a greenhouse. Growers in tropical areas can sow seed at any time of the year. Those in subtropical areas should sow seed once the soil has warmed in the spring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jicama Growing Information|url=http://greenharvest.com.au/SeedOrganic/VegetableGrowingInformation/JicamaGrowingInformation.html|publisher=Green Harvest|accessdate=31 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In cooking ==
[[File:Tajinbottle.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Diced fresh jícama, seasoned with ''[[Tajín (seasoning)|Tajín]]'' chili powder]]
The root's exterior is yellow and papery, while its inside is creamy white with a crisp texture that resembles raw potato or pear. The flavor is sweet and starchy, reminiscent of some apples or raw green beans, and it is usually eaten raw, sometimes with salt, lemon, or lime juice, ''[[alguashte]]'', and chili powder. It is also cooked in soups and stir-fried dishes.
Jícama is often paired with [[chili powder]], [[cilantro]], [[ginger]], [[lemon]], [[Lime (fruit)|lime]], [[Orange (fruit)|orange]], [[red onion]], [[Salsa (sauce)|salsa]], [[sesame oil]], grilled fish, and [[soy sauce]].&lt;ref name="fiegui" /&gt; It can be cut into thin wedges and dipped in salsa. In [[Mexico]], it is popular in salads, fresh fruit combinations, fruit bars, soups, and other cooked dishes. In contrast to the root, the remainder of the jícama plant is very [[poison]]ous; the seeds contain the toxin [[rotenone]], which is used to poison [[insect]]s and [[fish]].&lt;ref name=rotenone /&gt;

Spaniards spread cultivation of jícama from Mexico to the Philippines (where it is known as ''singkamas'', from Nahuatl ''xicamatl''),&lt;ref name="singkamas"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/singkamas|title=Singkamas|publisher=Merriam-Webster|accessdate=2 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; from there it went to China and other parts of [[Southeast Asia]], where notable uses of raw jícama include ''[[popiah]], '' fresh ''[[lumpia]]'' in the Philippines, and [[salad]]s in Indonesia, Singapore, and Malaysia such as ''[[yusheng]]'' and ''[[rojak]]''.

In the Philippines, jícama is usually eaten fresh with condiments such as [[rice vinegar]] and sprinkled with salt, or with ''bagoong'' ([[shrimp paste]]). In [[Bahasa Malaysia|Malay]], it is known by the name ''ubi sengkuang''. In [[Indonesia]], jícama is known as ''bengkuang''. This root crop is also known by people in Sumatra and Java,{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} and eaten at fresh fruit bars or mixed in the ''rojak'' (a kind of spicy fruit salad). [[Padang, Indonesia|Padang]], a city in West Sumatra, is called "the city of ''bengkuang''". Local people might have thought that this jícama is the "indigenous crop" of Padang. The crop has been grown everywhere in this city and it has become a part of their culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is Jicama?|url=http://www.innovateus.net/food/what-jicama|publisher=Innovateus|accessdate=30 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is known by its Chinese name ''bang kuang'' to the ethnic Chinese in Southeast Asia. In Mandarin Chinese, it is known as ''dòushǔ''(豆薯) or ''liáng shǔ'' (涼薯), as ''sa1 got'' 沙葛 (same as "turnip") in Yue Chinese/Cantonese, and as ''mang-guang'' 芒光 in Teochew, where the word is borrowed from the Malay, and as ''dìguā'' 地瓜 in Guizhou province and several neighboring provinces of China, the latter term being shared with sweet potatoes. Jícama has become popular in Vietnamese food as an ingredient in pie, where it is called ''cây củ đậu'' (in northern Vietnam) or ''củ sắn'' or ''sắn nước'' (in southern Vietnam).

In Japanese, it is known as 葛芋 (''kuzu-imo'').  In Myanmar, it is called စိမ်းစားဥ (''sane-saar-u''). Its Thai name is มันแกว (''man kaeo'').&lt;ref&gt;So Sethaputra, ''New Model Thai-English Dictionary'', Bangkok: Thai Watana Panich, 1965, p. 366.&lt;/ref&gt; In Cambodia, it is known as ដំឡូងរលួស /dɑmlɔoŋ rəluəh/ or under its Chinese name as ប៉ិកួៈ ~ ប៉ិគក់ /peʔkŭəʔ/.&lt;ref&gt;Pauline Dy Phon, វចនានុក្រមរុក្ខជាតិប្រើប្រាស់ក្នុងប្រទេសកម្ពុជា, ''Dictionnaire des Plantes utilisées au Cambodge, Dictionary of Plants used in Cambodia'', ភ្នំពេញ Phnom Penh, បោះពុម្ពលើកទី ១, រោងពុម្ព ហ ធីម អូឡាំពិក (រក្សាសិទ្ធិ៖ អ្នកគ្រូ ឌី ផុន) គ.ស. ២០០០, ទំព័រ ៤៨៥, 1st edition: 2000, Imprimerie Olympic Hor Thim (© Pauline Dy Phon), 1er tirage : 2000, Imprimerie Olympic Hor Thim, p. 485; វចនានុក្រមខ្មែរ  ពុទ្ធសាសនបណ្ឌិត្យ  ភ្នំពេញ  ព.ស. ២៥១០-២៥១១  គ.ស. ១៩៦៧-១៩៦៨  ទំព័រ ៦២៧, ១០១៣, ''Dictionnaire cambodgien'', Institut bouddhique de Phnom Penh, 1967-1968, p. 627, 1013.&lt;/ref&gt; In Bengali, it is known as ''shankhalu'' (শাঁখ আলু), literally translating to "conch (''[[shankha]]'', শাঁখ) potato (''alu'', আলু)" for its shape, size, and colour. In Hindi, it is known as ''mishrikand'' (मिश्रीकंद).  It is eaten during fast (उपवास) in Bihar (India) and is known as ''kesaur'' (केसौर). In [[Odia language|Odia]], it is known as (ଶଙ୍ଖ ସାରୁ) ''shankha saru''. In Laos, it is called ''man phao'' (ມັນເພົາ),&lt;ref&gt;Reinhorn, Marc, ''Dictionnaire laotien-français'', Paris: CNRS, 1970, p. 1635.&lt;/ref&gt; smaller and tastes a little sweeter than the Mexican type.  It is used as a snack by peeling off the outer layer of the skin, then cutting into bite sizes for eating like an apple or a pear.

== Nutrition ==
Jícama is high in carbohydrates in the form of [[dietary fiber]] (notably [[inulin]]).&lt;ref name="pmid28341907"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors=Hughes SR, Qureshi N, López-Núñez JC, Jones MA, Jarodsky JM, Galindo-Leva LÁ, Lindquist MR | title=Utilization of inulin-containing waste in industrial fermentations to produce biofuels and bio-based chemicals | journal= World Journal of Microbiology &amp;  Biotechnology | volume=33 | issue=4 | pages=48 | year=2017 | doi= 10.1007/s11274-017-2241-6 | PMID = 28341907 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is composed of 86–90% water; it contains only trace amounts of [[protein]] and [[lipid]]s. Its sweet flavor comes from the [[Fructooligosaccharide|oligofructose]] [[inulin]] (also called fructo-oligosaccharide), which is a [[Prebiotic (nutrition)|prebiotic]]. Jícama is very low in saturated fat and sodium. It is also a good source of vitamin C.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nutrition Data: Yambean (jicama), raw|url=http://nutritiondata.self.com/facts/vegetables-and-vegetable-products/2727/2#ixzz377hOonGG|website=Nutrition Data|accessdate=11 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Storage ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2017}}
Jícama should be stored dry, between 12 and 16°C (53 and 60°F). As colder temperatures will damage the roots, whole unpeeled jicama root  should not be refrigerated. A fresh root stored at an appropriate temperature will keep for a month or two.

'''Plasma-immersion ion implantation''' (PIII)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Materials Science of Thin Films | author = Milton Ohring | publisher = [[Academic Press]] | date = 2002 | isbn = 978-0-12-524975-1 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=SOt_yFjV-xwC&amp;pg=PA267&amp;dq=%22Plasma+immersion+ion+implantation%22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or pulsed-plasma doping (pulsed PIII)  is a [[surface finishing|surface modification]] technique of extracting the accelerated ions from the plasma by applying a [[high voltage]] [[pulsed DC]] or pure [[Direct current|DC]] [[power supply]] and targeting them into a suitable [[Substrate (materials science)|substrate]] or [[electrode]] with a semiconductor [[Wafer (electronics)|wafer]] placed over it, so as to implant it with suitable [[dopants]]. The electrode is a [[cathode]] for an [[electropositive plasma]], while it is an [[anode]] for an [[electronegative plasma]]. Plasma can be generated in a suitably designed [[vacuum chamber]] with the help of various plasma sources such as [[Electron Cyclotron Resonance]] plasma source which yields plasma with the highest ion density and lowest contamination level, [[helicon plasma]] source, [[capacitively coupled plasma]] source,  [[inductively coupled plasma]] source, [[Glow discharge|DC glow discharge]] and metal vapor [[Electric arc|arc]](for [[metal]]lic species).  The vacuum chamber can be of two types - ''[[diode]]'' and ''[[triode]]'' type&lt;ref name=liberman&gt;Michael A. Liberman and Allan J. Lichtenberg, Principles of plasma discharges and material processing, Ed. New York: John Wiley and Sons, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; depending upon whether the power supply is applied to the substrate as in the former case or to the [[perforated]] [[Grid (graphic design)|grid]] as in the latter.

== Working ==
[[File:Diode-type Plasma Immersion Ion Implanter (diagram).jpg|Conventional or ''diode'' type Plasma Immersion Ion Implanter|450px|thumb]]

In a conventional ''immersion'' type of PIII system, also called as the ''[[diode]]'' type configuration,&lt;ref name=liberman/&gt; the wafer is kept at a negative [[potential]] since the positively charged ions of the [[electropositive]] plasma are the ones who get extracted and implanted. The wafer sample to be treated is placed on a sample holder in a vacuum chamber. The sample holder is connected to a high voltage [[power supply]] and is [[Insulator (electrical)|electrically insulated]] from the chamber wall. By means of [[pump]]ing and [[gas]] feed systems, an atmosphere of a working gas at a suitable [[pressure]] is created.&lt;ref&gt;W. Ensinger, “Semiconductor processing by plasma immersion ion implantation”, Materials science &amp; engineering. A., Vol. 253, No. 1 - 2, 1998, pp. 258–268.&lt;/ref&gt;

When the [[Substrate (materials science)|substrate]] is biased to a [[Negative number|negative]] [[voltage]] (few KV's), the [[resultant]] [[electric field]] drives [[electrons]] away from the substrate in the [[time]] scale of the inverse electron plasma frequency  ω&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; ( ~ l0&lt;sup&gt;−9&lt;/sup&gt; sec). Thus an ion matrix [[Debye sheath]]&lt;ref name=liberman/&gt;&lt;ref name=anders/&gt; which is depleted of electrons forms around it. The negatively biased substrate will accelerate the ions within a time scale of the inverse ion plasma frequency ω&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; ( ~ 10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt; sec). This ion movement lowers the ion density in the bulk, which causes the sheath-plasma [[Boundary (thermodynamic)|boundary]] to expand in order to sustain the applied [[potential]] drop,in the process exposing more ions. The [[Debye sheath|plasma sheath]] expands until either a steady-state condition is reached, which is called [[Debye sheath#The Child–Langmuir Law|Child Langmuir law]] limit; or the high voltage is switched off as in the case of [[Pulsed DC]] biasing. Pulse biasing is preferred over DC biasing because it creates less damage during the pulse ON time and [[Neutralization (chemistry)|neutralization]] of unwanted [[Electric charge|charges]] accumulated on the wafer in the [[afterglow]] period (i.e. after the pulse has ended). In case of pulsed biasing the T&lt;sub&gt;ON&lt;/sub&gt; time of the pulse is generally kept at 20-40 µs, while the T&lt;sub&gt;OFF&lt;/sub&gt; is kept at 0.5-2 ms i.e. a duty cycle of 1-8%. The power supply used is in range of 500 V to hundreds of KV and the pressure in the range of 1-100 [[Torr|mTorr]].&lt;ref name=anders&gt;André Anders et al., Handbook of Plasma Immersion Ion Implantation and Deposition, Ed.  New York: John Wiley and Sons, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; This is the basic principle of the operation of ''immersion'' type PIII.

In case of a ''[[triode]]'' type configuration, a suitable perforated grid is placed in between the substrate and the plasma and a pulsed DC bias is applied to this grid. Here the same theory applies as previously discussed, but with a difference that the extracted ions from the grid holes bombard the substrate, thus causing implantation. In this sense a ''triode'' type PIII implanter is a crude version of [[ion implantation]] because it does not contain plethora of components like ion [[beam steering]], beam focusing, additional [[Grid (graphic design)|grid]] accelerators  etc.

[[File:Spruce plywood.JPG|thumb|300px|[[Softwood]] plywood made from [[spruce]]]]
'''Plywood''' is a material manufactured from thin layers or "plies" of [[wood veneer]] that are glued together with adjacent layers having their [[wood grain]] rotated up to 90 degrees to one another. It is an [[engineered wood]] from the family of manufactured boards which includes [[medium-density fibreboard]] (MDF) and [[particle board]] (chipboard).

All plywoods bind resin and wood fibre sheets ([[cellulose]] cells are long, strong and thin) to form a [[composite material]]. This alternation of the grain is called ''cross-graining'' and has several important benefits: it reduces the tendency of wood to split when nailed in at the edges; it reduces expansion and shrinkage, providing improved dimensional stability; and it makes the strength of the panel consistent across all directions.  There is usually an odd number of plies, so that the sheet is balanced—this reduces warping. Because plywood is bonded with grains running against one another and with an odd number of composite parts, it has high [[stiffness]] perpendicular to the grain direction of the surface ply. 

Smaller, thinner, and lower-quality plywoods may only have their plies (layers) arranged at right angles to each other. Some better-quality plywood products will by design have five plies in steps of 45 degrees (0, 45, 90, 135, and 180 degrees), giving strength in multiple axes.

The word ''ply'' derives from the French verb {{lang|fr|plier}},&lt;ref&gt;Collins Dictionary of the English Language, 2nd Edition, London, 1986, p.1181&lt;/ref&gt; "to fold", from the Latin verb {{lang|la|plico}}, from the ancient Greek verb {{lang|grc|πλέκω}}.&lt;ref&gt;Cassell's Latin Dictionary, Marchant, J.R.V, &amp; Charles, Joseph F., (Eds.), Revised Edition, 1928, p.421&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

In 1797 [[Samuel Bentham]] applied for patents covering several machines to produce veneers. In his patent applications, he described the concept of laminating several layers of veneer with glue to form a thicker piece – the first description of what we now call plywood.&lt;ref name="Plywood"&gt;{{cite web|title=Plywood|url=http://www.answers.com/topic/plywood|work=Gale's How Products are Made|publisher=The Gale Group Inc.|accessdate=26 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Bentham was a British naval engineer with many shipbuilding inventions to his credit. Veneers at the time of Bentham were [[flat sawn]], [[rift sawing|rift sawn]] or [[quarter sawn]]; i.e. cut along or across the log manually in different angles to the grain and thus limited in width and length.

About fifty years later [[Immanuel Nobel]], father of [[Alfred Nobel]], realized that several thinner layers of wood bonded together would be stronger than a single thick layer of wood. Understanding the industrial potential of laminated wood, he invented the [[Lathe#Rotary lathes|rotary lathe]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://thetimberpanel.blogspot.com/2013/09/nobel-plywood.html|title=Nobel Plywood|language=en|access-date=2018-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is little record of the early implementation of the rotary lathe and the subsequent commercialization of plywood as we know it today, but in its 1870 edition, the French dictionary ''Robert'' describes the process of rotary lathe veneer manufacturing in its entry ''Déroulage''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dérouler|url=http://historique.fracademic.com/18379d%C3%A9rouler|work=Le Robert Historique de la langue française|publisher=Dictionnaires Robert|accessdate=26 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One can thus presume that rotary lathe plywood manufacturer was an established process in France in the 1860s. Plywood was introduced into the United States in 1865&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Plywood|url=http://www.answers.com/topic/plywood|publisher=Columbia Encyclopedia|accessdate=26 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and industrial production started shortly after. In 1928, the first standard-sized 4&amp;nbsp;ft by 8&amp;nbsp;ft (1.2 m by 2.4 m) plywood sheets were introduced in the United States for use as a general building material.&lt;ref name="Plywood"/&gt;

Artists use plywood as a support for easel paintings to replace traditional canvas or cardboard. Ready-made ''artist boards'' for oil painting in three-layered plywood (3-ply) were produced and sold in New York as early as 1880.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Muller|first=Norman E.|title=An early example of a plywood support for painting|url=https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/3179496?uid=3738016&amp;uid=2129&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=70&amp;uid=4&amp;sid=21102998036157|work=Journal of the American Institute for Conservation|publisher=American Institute for Conservation of Historic and Artistic Works|accessdate=26 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structural characteristics==
A typical plywood panel has face veneers of a higher grade than the core veneers. The principal function of the core layers is to increase the separation between the outer layers where the bending stresses are highest, thus increasing the panel's resistance to [[bending]]. As a result, thicker panels can span greater distances under the same loads. In bending, the maximum stress occurs in the outermost layers, one in [[tension (physics)|tension]], the other in [[compression (physical)|compression]]. Bending stress decreases from the maximum at the face layers to nearly zero at the central layer. [[Shear stress]], by contrast, is higher in the center of the panel, and at the outer fibres.

==Types of plywood==
[[File:plywood.jpg|thumb|right|Average-quality plywood with 'show veneer']]
[[File:multiplex.png|thumb|right|High-quality concrete pouring plate in plywood]]
[[File:Birke Multiplex.JPG|thumb|right|[[Birch]] plywood]]

Different varieties of plywood exist for different applications:

===Softwood plywood===

[[Softwood]] plywood is usually made either of [[Cedrus|cedar]], [[Douglas fir]] or [[spruce]], [[pine]], and [[fir]] (collectively known as [[spruce-pine-fir]] or SPF) or [[redwood]] and is typically used for construction and industrial purposes.&lt;ref&gt;O'Halloran, p. 221.&lt;/ref&gt;

The most common dimension is {{convert|1.2|x|2.4|m}} or the slightly larger imperial dimension of 4&amp;nbsp;feet × 8&amp;nbsp;feet. Plies vary in thickness from 1.4&amp;nbsp;mm to 4.3&amp;nbsp;mm. The number of plies—which is always odd—depends on the thickness and grade of the sheet. [[Roofing material|Roofing]] can use the thinner {{convert|5/8|in|adj=on}} plywood. Subfloors are at least {{convert|3/4|in}} thick, the thickness depending on the distance between floor [[joist]]s. Plywood for flooring applications is often [[tongue and groove]] (T&amp;G); This prevents one board from moving up or down relative to its neighbor, providing a solid-feeling floor when the joints do not lie over joists. T&amp;G plywood is usually found in the {{convert|1/2|to|1|in|adj=on}} range.

===Hardwood plywood===

[[Hardwood]] plywood is made out of wood from [[angiosperm]] trees and used for demanding end uses. Hardwood plywood is characterized by its excellent strength, stiffness and resistance to creep. It has a high planar shear strength and impact resistance, which make it especially suitable for heavy-duty floor and wall structures. Oriented plywood construction has a high wheel-carrying capacity. Hardwood plywood has excellent surface hardness, and damage- and wear-resistance.&lt;ref name="Handbook"&gt;''Handbook of Finnish plywood'', Finnish Forest Industries Federation, 2002, {{ISBN|952-9506-63-5}} {{cite web |url=http://www.forestindustries.fi/infokortit/handbookplywood/Documents/HandbookOfFinnishPlywood.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-09-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927200306/http://www.forestindustries.fi/infokortit/handbookplywood/Documents/HandbookOfFinnishPlywood.pdf |archivedate=2007-09-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Tropical plywood ===

Tropical plywood is made of mixed species of [[tropical timber]].  Originally from the Asian region, it is now also manufactured in African and South American countries.  Tropical plywood is superior to softwood plywood due to its density, strength, evenness of layers, and high quality.  It is usually sold at a premium in many markets if manufactured with high standards.  Tropical plywood is widely used in the UK, Japan, United States, Taiwan, Korea, Dubai, and other countries worldwide.  It is used for construction purposes in many regions due to its low cost.  However, many countries’ forests have been over-harvested, including the Philippines, Malaysia and Indonesia, largely due to the demand for plywood production and export.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

===Aircraft plywood===
[[File:De Havilland DH-98 Mosquito ExCC.jpg|thumb|[[de Havilland Mosquito|De Havilland DH-98 Mosquito]] was made of curved and glued veneers]]

High-strength plywood, also known as aircraft plywood, is made from mahogany, spruce and/or birch using adhesives with an increased resistance to heat and humidity. It was used in the construction of air assault gliders during [[World War II]] and also several [[fighter aircraft]], most notably the multi-role British [[De Havilland Mosquito|Mosquito]]. Nicknamed "The Wooden Wonder" plywood was used for the wing surfaces, and also flat sections such as bulkheads and the webs of the wing spars. The fuselage had exceptional rigidity from the bonded ply-balsa-ply ‘sandwich’ of its [[monocoque]] shell; elliptical in cross-section, it was formed in two separate mirror-image halves, using curved moulds.

Structural aircraft-grade plywood is most commonly manufactured from African mahogany, spruce or birch veneers that are bonded together in a hot press over hardwood cores of basswood or poplar or from European Birch veneers throughout. Basswood is another type of aviation-grade plywood that is lighter and more flexible than mahogany and birch plywood but has slightly less{{Citation needed|reason=da012|date=April 2013}} structural strength. Aviation-grade plywood is manufactured to a number of specifications including those outlined since 1931 in the Germanischer Lloyd Rules for Surveying and Testing of Plywood for Aircraft and MIL-P-607, the latter of which calls for shear testing after immersion in boiling water for three hours to verify the adhesive qualities between the plies and meets specifications.

===Decorative plywood (overlaid plywood)===

Usually faced with [[hardwood]], including [[ash (tree)|ash]], [[oak]], [[Erythrobalanus|red oak]], [[birch]], [[maple]], [[mahogany]], [[Shorea|Philippine mahogany]] (often called lauan, luan or meranti and having no relation to true mahogany), [[rosewood]], [[teak]] and a large number of other hardwoods.

===Flexible plywood===

Flexible plywood is designed for making curved parts, a practice which dates back to the 1850s in furniture making.

Aircraft grade plywood, often Baltic birch, is made from three or more plies of birch, as thin as {{convert|1/64|in}} thick in total, and is extremely strong and light. At {{convert|3/8|in}} thick, mahogany three-ply "wiggle board" or "bendy board" come in {{convert|4|×|8|ft}} sheets with a very thin cross-grain central ply and two thicker exterior plies, either long grain on the sheet, or cross grain. Wiggle board is often glued together in two layers once it is formed into the desired curve, so that the final shape will be stiff and resist movement. Often, decorative wood veneers are added as a surface layer.

In the United Kingdom single-ply sheets of veneer were used to make [[Top hat|stovepipe hats]] in Victorian times, so flexible modern plywood is sometimes known there as "hatters ply",{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} although the original material was not strictly plywood, but a single sheet of veneer.

===Marine plywood===

Marine plywood is manufactured from durable face and core veneers, with few defects so it performs longer in both humid and wet conditions and resists delaminating and fungal attack. Its construction is such that it can be used in environments where it is exposed to moisture for long periods. Each wood veneer will be from tropical hardwoods, have negligible core gap, limiting the chance of trapping water in the plywood and hence providing a solid and stable glue bond. It uses an exterior Water and Boil Proof (WBP) glue similar to most exterior plywoods.

Marine plywood can be graded as being compliant with [[BS 1088]], which is a [[British Standard]] for marine plywood. There are few international standards for grading marine plywood and most of the standards are voluntary. Some marine plywood has a [[Lloyd's of London]] stamp that certifies it to be BS 1088 compliant. Some plywood is also labeled based on the wood used to manufacture it. Examples of this are [[Aucoumea klaineana|Okoumé]] or [[Shorea|Meranti]].

===Other plywoods===

Other types of plywoods include fire-retardant, moisture-resistant, wire mesh, sign-grade, and pressure-treated. However, the plywood may be treated with various chemicals to improve the plywood's fireproofing. Each of these products is designed to fill a need in industry.

Baltic Birch plywood is a product of an area around the Baltic Sea. Originally manufactured for European cabinet makers but now popular in the United States as well. It is very stable composed of an inner void-free core of cross-banded birch plys with an exterior grade adhesive. The face veneers are thicker than traditional cabinet grade plywood.

== Production ==
[[File:Sandakan Sabah Plywood-Factory-20a.jpg|thumb|Logs for plywood construction in a plywood factory]]
Plywood production requires a good log, called a peeler, which is generally straighter and larger in diameter than one required for processing into dimensioned lumber by a [[sawmill]]. The log is laid horizontally and rotated about its long axis while a long blade is pressed into it, causing a thin layer of wood to peel off (much as a continuous sheet of paper from a roll). An adjustable nosebar, which may be solid or a roller, is pressed against the log during rotation, to create a "gap" for veneer to pass through between the knife and the nosebar.  The nosebar partly compresses the wood as it is peeled; it controls vibration of the peeling knife; and assists in keeping the veneer being peeled to an accurate thickness.  In this way the log is peeled into sheets of veneer, which are then cut to the desired oversize dimensions, to allow it to shrink (depending on wood species) when dried.  The sheets are then patched, graded, glued together and then baked in a press at a temperature of at least {{convert|140|°C|°F|abbr=on}}, and at a pressure of up to {{convert|1.9|MPa|psi|abbr=on}} (but more commonly 200 psi) to form the plywood panel. The panel can then be patched, have minor surface defects such as splits or small knot holes filled, re-sized, sanded or otherwise refinished, depending on the market for which it is intended.

Plywood for indoor use generally uses the less expensive [[urea-formaldehyde]] glue, which has limited water resistance, while outdoor and marine-grade plywood are designed to withstand moisture, and use a water-resistant [[Phenol formaldehyde resin|phenol-formaldehyde]] glue to prevent [[delamination]] and to retain strength in high [[humidity]].

Anti-[[fungal]] additives such as Xyligen (Furmecyclox)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pesticideinfo.org/Detail_Chemical.jsp?Rec_Id=PC36337 Entry on the PAN Pesticide Database]. Retrieved 8 June 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; may sometimes be added to the glueline to provide added resistance to fungal attack.

The adhesives used in plywood have become a point of concern. Both urea formaldehyde and phenol formaldehyde are carcinogenic in very high concentrations. As a result, many manufacturers are turning to low formaldehyde-emitting glue systems, denoted by an "E" rating. Plywood produced to "E0" has effectively zero formaldehyde emissions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ewp.asn.au/newsandmedia/downloads/media_release_-_formaldehyde_emissions.pdf Engineered Wood Products Association of Australasia]. (PDF). Retrieved on 2012-02-10.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the glues being brought to the forefront, the wood resources themselves are becoming the focus of manufacturers, due in part to energy conservation, as well as concern for natural resources. There are several certifications available to manufacturers who participate in these programs. [[Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification]] (PEFC) [[Forest Stewardship Council]] (FSC), [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design]] (LEED), [[Sustainable Forestry Initiative]] (SFI), and Greenguard are all certification programs that ensure that production and construction practices are sustainable. Many of these programs offer tax benefits to both the manufacturer and the end user.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prowoodworkingtips.com/Plywood.html Pro Woodworking Tips.com]. Pro Woodworking Tips.com. Retrieved on 2012-02-10.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sizes==
The most commonly used thickness range is from {{convert|1/8|to|3.0|in|mm}}. The sizes of the most commonly used plywood sheets are 4 x 8 feet (1220 x 2440&amp;nbsp;mm) which was first used by the Portland Manufacturing Company, who developed what we know of as modern veneer core plywood for the 1905 Portland World Fair. A common metric size for a sheet of plywood is 1200 x 2400&amp;nbsp;mm. {{convert|5|xx|5|ft|mm}} is also a common European size for Baltic birch ply, and aircraft ply.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cps.gov.on.ca/english/plans/E9000/9011/M-9011L.pdf Metric conversions, Canadian government publication] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100216044053/http://www.cps.gov.on.ca/english/plans/E9000/9011/M-9011L.pdf |date=2010-02-16 }}. (PDF). Retrieved on 2012-02-10.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sizes on specialised plywood for concrete-forming can range from {{convert|abbr=on|15/64|to|13/16|in|mm|0}}, and a multitude of formats exist, though 15&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;{{convert|abbr=on|750|xx|1,500|mm|in|disp=x| (.59in&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;|)}} (19/32in&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;2&amp;nbsp;ft-6in&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;4&amp;nbsp;ft-11in)&lt;!--todo: replace with convert template once it supports fractional ft-inch output in ranges--&gt; is very commonly used.

Aircraft plywood is available in thicknesses of {{convert|1/8|in|mm|0}} (3 ply construction) and upwards; typically aircraft plywood uses veneers of 0.5&amp;nbsp;mm&amp;nbsp;(approx&amp;nbsp;1/64&amp;nbsp;in) thickness although much thinner veneers such as 0.1&amp;nbsp;mm are also used in construction of some of the thinner panels.

== Grades ==
Grading rules differ according to the country of origin. The most popular standards are the British Standard (BS) and the American Standard (ASTM). Joyce (1970), however, list some general indication of grading rules:&lt;ref&gt;Joyce, Ernes. 1970. ''The Technique of Furniture Making''. London: B. T. Batsford Limited.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications ==

Plywood is used in many applications that need high-quality, high-strength sheet material. Quality in this context means resistance to cracking, breaking, shrinkage, twisting and warping.

Exterior glued plywood is suitable for outdoor use, but because moisture affects the strength of wood, optimal performance is achieved where the moisture content remains relatively low. Subzero conditions do not affect the dimensional or strength properties of plywood,  making some special applications possible.

Plywood is also used as an engineering material for stressed-skin applications. It has been used for marine and aviation applications since WWII. Most notable is the British [[de Havilland Mosquito]] bomber, with a fuselage made of birch plywood sandwiching a [[Ochroma pyramidale|balsa]] core, and using plywood extensively for the wings. Plywood was also used for the hulls in the [[Chine (boating)|hard-chine]] [[Motor Torpedo Boat]]s (MTB) and [[Motor Gun Boat]]s  (MGB) built by the [[British Power Boat Company]] and [[Vosper &amp; Company|Vosper]]'s. Plywood is currently successfully used in [[stressed skin|stressed-skin]] applications.{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}} The American designers [[Charles Eames|Charles]] and [[Ray Eames]] are known for their plywood-based furniture, as is Finnish Architect Alvar Aalto and his firm [[Artek (company)|Artek]], while [[Phil Bolger]] has designed a wide range of boats built primarily of plywood. Jack Köper of Cape Town designed the plywood [[Dabchick (dinghy)|Dabchick sailing dinghy]], which {{as of|2015|lc=y}} is still sailed by large numbers of teenagers.

Plywood is often used to create curved surfaces because it can easily bend with the grain. Skateboard ramps often utilize plywood as the top smooth surface over bent curves to create transition that can simulate the shapes of ocean waves.

===Softwood plywood applications===
Typical end uses of spruce plywood are:
*Floors, walls and roofs in home constructions
*Wind bracing panels
*Vehicle internal body work
*Packages and boxes
*Fencing

There are coating solutions available that mask the prominent grain structure of spruce plywood. For these coated plywoods there are some end uses where reasonable strength is needed but the lightness of spruce is a benefit e.g.:
*Concrete shuttering panels
*Ready-to-paint surfaces for constructions

===[[Hardwood]] plywood applications===
[[Phenolic resin]] film coated (Film Faced) plywood is typically used as a ready-to-install component e.g.:
*Panels in concrete form work systems
*Floors, walls and roofs in transport vehicles
*Container floors
*Floors subjected to heavy wear in various buildings and factories
*Scaffolding materials

::("Wire" or other styles of imprinting available for better traction)

Birch plywood is used as a structural material in special applications e.g.:
*[[Wind turbine]] blades
*Insulation boxes for [[liquefied natural gas]] (LNG) carriers

Smooth surface and accurate thickness combined with the durability of the material makes birch plywood a favorable material for many special end uses e.g.:
*High-end loud speakers
*Die-cutting boards
*Supporting structure for parquet
*Playground equipment
*Furniture
*Signs and fences for demanding outdoor advertising
*Musical instruments
*Sports equipment

===Tropical plywood applications===
Tropical plywood is widely available from the South-East Asia region, mainly from [[Malaysia]] and [[Indonesia]].

*Common plywood
*Concrete panel
*Floor base
*Structure panel
*Container flooring
*Lamin board
*[[Laminated veneer lumber]] (LVL)

'''Sikmogil''' is a holiday in [[South Korea]], the Korean [[Arbor Day]]. It is celebrated annually on April 5. This day was designated by presidential decree in 1949 following legislation by the [[National Assembly (South Korea)|National Assembly]].

In 1960, Sikmogil's status as a holiday was abolished and April 5 was treated as any other day. However, the following year the official status of the holiday was restored. In 2006, Sikmogil's holiday status was abolished again.

The idea of Sikmogil was to celebrate [[forestry]] and the development of national history. The day of April 5 was chosen for its historical significance. On April 5, [[Silla]] achieved the unification of the [[Three Kingdoms of Korea]].

On Sikmogil, South Korean people plant trees that are appropriate for the region's climate. Government offices help people plant trees. During the month of Sikmogil, the government encourages the economical utilization of forestry by designating a "National Planting Period." Even though Sikmogil was abolished in 2006 as a holiday, the South Korean public continues to take part in meaningful activities.

'''The Conservation Society''' was an early [[Great Britain|British]] environmental organisation founded by Douglas M. C. MacEwan &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.clanewen.org/flowers/douglasmacewan/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-08-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724012952/http://www.clanewen.org/flowers/douglasmacewan/ |archivedate=2011-07-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1966, in response to what were seen to be fundamental [[Ecology|ecological]] constraints on continued [[economic growth]] and [[population growth]] in the UK.&lt;ref name="Veldman"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/Fantasy-Bomb-Greening-Britain-1945-1980/dp/0521466652|title=Fantasy, the Bomb, and the Greening of Britain|author=Meredith Veldman|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|date=1994|pages=217-222|isbn=978-0521440608}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Society received particular press attention in November 1969 for its submission to the [[Science and Technology Select Committee|House of Commons Select Committee on Science and Technology]] of a paper entitled ''Why Britain Needs a Population Policy''.&lt;ref name="Veldman"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://catalogue.lse.ac.uk/Record/1078182 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-09-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728002310/https://catalogue.lse.ac.uk/Record/1078182 |archivedate=2011-07-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Society was directed by John Davoll from 1970 until its winding-up in 1987.&lt;ref name="Veldman"/&gt;

The Society published, in association with Volturna Press, in 1968 and 1969, three compilations of articles sympathetic to its aims as 'Conservation Society Reprints' Volumes I, II and 3. This was succeeded by 'Conservation Topics' with original material. 

Note: As a past (non activist) member of the CS I recollect that the society broke up due to disagreements over nuclear issues.

{{Thermoelectric effect|cTopic=Applications}}

A '''thermoelectric generator''' ('''TEG'''), also called a '''Seebeck generator''', is a [[Solid-state electronics|solid state]] device that converts heat flux (temperature differences) directly into electrical energy through a phenomenon called the [[Seebeck effect]] (a form of [[thermoelectric effect]]). Thermoelectric generators function like [[heat engine]]s, but are less bulky and have no moving parts. However, TEGs are typically more expensive and less efficient.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Review of thermoelectricity to improve energy quality|url = http://www.jetir.org/view?paper=JETIR1503089|publisher = JETIR|date = 2015-03-01|volume =  2 - Issue 3 (March-2015)|first = Mr Nikunj|last = Adroja|first2 = Prof Shruti|last2 = B.Mehta|first3 = Mr Pratik|last3 = Shah}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thermoelectric generators could be used in [[Power station|power plants]] in order to convert [[waste heat]] into additional electrical power and in automobiles as [[automotive thermoelectric generator]]s (ATGs) to increase fuel efficiency. Another application is  [[radioisotope thermoelectric generator]]s which are used in space probes, which has the same mechanism but use radioisotopes to generate the required heat difference.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==History==
In 1821, [[Thomas Johann Seebeck]] rediscovered that a thermal gradient formed between two dissimilar conductors can produce electricity.&lt;ref&gt;See:

The flow of charge carriers between the hot and cold regions in turn creates a voltage difference. In 1834, [[Jean Charles Athanase Peltier]] discovered the reverse effect, that running an electric current through the junction of two dissimilar conductors could, depending on the direction of the current, cause it to act as a heater or cooler.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Peltier |year=1834 |url={{google books|plainurl=y|id=1Jc5AAAAcAAJ|page=37}} |title=Nouvelles expériences sur la caloricité des courants électrique (New experiments on the heat effects of electric currents) |journal=Annales de Chimie et de Physique |volume=56 |pp=371–386}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Construction==
Thermoelectric power generators consist of three major components: thermoelectric materials, thermoelectric modules and thermoelectric systems that interface with the heat source.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|title = How Thermoelectric Generators Work - Alphabet Energy|url = https://www.alphabetenergy.com/how-thermoelectrics-work/|website = Alphabet Energy|accessdate = 2015-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Thermoelectric materials ===
{{main article|Thermoelectric materials}}Thermoelectric materials generate power directly from heat by converting temperature differences into electric voltage. These materials must have both high [[electrical conductivity]] (σ) and low [[thermal conductivity]] (κ) to be good thermoelectric materials. Having low thermal conductivity ensures that when one side is made hot, the other side stays cold, which helps to generate a large voltage while in a temperature gradient. The measure of the magnitude of electrons flow in response to a temperature difference across that material is given by the [[Seebeck coefficient]] (S). The efficiency of a given material to produce a thermoelectric power is governed by its “[[Thermoelectric figure of merit|figure of merit]]” zT = S&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;σT/κ.

For many years, the main three [[semiconductor]]s known to have both low thermal conductivity and high power factor were [[bismuth telluride]] (Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Te&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), [[lead telluride]] (PbTe), and [[Silicon-germanium|silicon germanium]] (SiGe). These materials have very rare elements which make them very expensive compounds.

Today, the thermal conductivity of semiconductors can be lowered without affecting their high electrical properties using [[nanotechnology]].  This can be achieved by creating nanoscale features such as particles, wires or interfaces in bulk semiconductor materials. However, the manufacturing processes of [[Nanomaterials|nano-materials]] is still challenging. [[File:Thermoelectric Generator Diagram.svg|thumb|A thermoelectric circuit composed of materials of different Seebeck coefficient (p-doped and n-doped semiconductors), configured as a thermoelectric generator.|254x254px]]

=== Thermoelectric module ===
A thermoelectric module is a circuit containing thermoelectric materials which generates electricity from heat directly. A thermoelectric module consists of two dissimilar thermoelectric materials joined at their ends: an n-type (negatively charged), and a p-type (positively charged) semiconductor.  A direct electric current will flow in the circuit when there is a temperature difference between the ends of the materials. Generally, the current magnitude is directly proportional to the temperature difference. {{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

In application, thermoelectric modules in power generation work in very tough mechanical and thermal conditions. Because they operate in a very high temperature gradient, the modules are subject to large thermally induced stresses and strains for long periods of time. They also are subject to mechanical [[Fatigue (material)|fatigue]] caused by large number of thermal cycles.

Thus, the junctions and materials must be selected so that they survive these tough mechanical and thermal conditions. Also, the module must be designed such that the two thermoelectric materials are thermally in parallel, but electrically in series. The efficiency of a thermoelectric module is greatly affected by the geometry of its design.

=== Thermoelectric system ===
Using thermoelectric modules, a thermoelectric system generates power by taking in heat from a source such as a hot exhaust flue. In order to do that, the system needs a large temperature gradient, which is not easy in real-world applications. The cold side must be cooled by air or water. [[Heat exchanger]]s are used on both sides of the modules to supply this heating and cooling.

There are many challenges in designing a reliable TEG system that operates at high temperatures. Achieving high efficiency in the system requires extensive engineering design in order to balance between the heat flow through the modules and maximizing the temperature gradient across them. To do this, designing heat exchanger technologies in the system is one of the most important aspects of TEG engineering. In addition, the system requires to minimize the thermal losses due to the interfaces between materials at several places. Another challenging constraint is avoiding large pressure drops between the heating and cooling sources.

After the [[DC power]] from the TE modules passes through an inverter, the TEG produces [[AC Power Transmission|AC power]], which in turn, requires an integrated power electronics system to deliver it to the customer.

== Materials for TEG ==
Only a few known materials to date are identified as thermoelectric materials. Most thermoelectric materials today have a zT, the figure of merit, value of around 1, such as in [[Bismuth telluride|Bismuth Telluride]] (Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Te&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) at room temperature and [[lead telluride]] (PbTe) at 500-700K. However, in order to be competitive with other power generation systems, TEG materials should have a zT of 2-3. Most research in thermoelectric materials has focused on increasing the [[Seebeck coefficient]] (S) and reducing the thermal conductivity, especially by manipulating the [[Nanostructured Materials|nanostructure]] of the thermoelectric materials. Because the thermal and electrical conductivity correlate with the charge carriers, new means must be introduced in order to conciliate the contradiction between high electrical conductivity and low thermal conductivity as indicated.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Thermoelectric Power Generation Using Waste-Heat Energy as an Alternative Green Technology|url = http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/ben/eeng/2009/00000002/00000001/art00004|journal = Recent Patents on Electrical &amp; Electronic Engineering (Formerly Recent Patents on Electrical Engineering)|date = 2009-01-01|pages = 27–39|volume = 2|issue = 1|first = Basel I.|last = Ismail|first2 = Wael H.|last2 = Ahmed|doi=10.2174/1874476110902010027}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When selecting materials for thermoelectric generation, a number of other factors need to be considered. During operation, ideally the thermoelectric generator has a large temperature gradient across it.  Thermal expansion will then introduce stress in the device which may cause fracture of the thermoelectric legs, or separation from the coupling material.  The mechanical properties of the materials must be considered and the coefficient of thermal expansion of the n and p-type material must be matched reasonably well. In segmented thermoelectric generators, the material's compatibility must also be considered.

A material's compatibility factor is defined as

&lt;math&gt;s = \left ( \frac{\sqrt{1-zT}-1}{ST} \right )&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Snyder|first1=G.|title=Thermoelectric Efficiency and Compatibility|journal=Physical Review Letters|date=Oct 2003|volume=91|issue=14|doi=10.1103/physrevlett.91.148301|url=https://trs.jpl.nasa.gov/bitstream/2014/7550/1/03-1478.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the compatibility factor from one segment to the next differs by more than a factor of about two, the device will not operate efficiently.  The material parameters determining s (as well as zT) are temperature dependent, so the compatibility factor may change from the hot side to the cold side of the device, even in one segment.  This behavior is referred to as self-compatibility and may become important in devices design for low temperature operation.

In general, thermoelectric materials can be categorized into conventional and new materials:

=== Conventional materials ===
Many TEG materials are employed in commercial applications today. These materials can be  divided into three groups based on the temperature range of operation:
# Low temperature materials (up to around 450&amp;nbsp;K): Alloys based on [[Bismuthine|Bismuth]] (Bi) in combinations with [[Antimony]] (Sb), [[Tellurium]] (Te) or [[Selenium]] (Se).
# Intermediate temperature (up to 850&amp;nbsp;K): such as materials based on alloys of [[Lead]] (Pb) 
# Highest temperatures material (up to 1300&amp;nbsp;K): materials fabricated from [[Silicon-germanium|silicon germanium]] (SiGe) alloys. 
Although these materials still remain the cornerstone for commercial and practical applications in thermoelectric power generation, significant advances have been made in synthesizing new materials and fabricating material structures with improved thermoelectric performance. Recent research has focused  on improving the material’s figure-of-merit (zT), and hence the conversion efficiency, by reducing the lattice thermal conductivity.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== New materials ===
Researchers are trying to develop new thermoelectric materials for power generation by improving the figure-of-merit zT. One example of these materials is the semiconductor compound ß-Zn&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Sb&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, which possesses an exceptionally low thermal conductivity and exhibits a maximum zT of 1.3 at a temperature of 670K. This material is also relatively inexpensive and stable up to this temperature in a vacuum, and can be a good alternative in the temperature range between materials based on Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Te&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and PbTe.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Beside improving the figure-of-merit, there is increasing focus to develop new materials by increasing the electrical power output, decreasing cost and developing environmentally friendly materials. For example, when the fuel cost is low or almost free, such as in [[waste heat recovery unit|waste heat recovery]], then the cost per watt is only determined by the power per unit area and the operating period. As a result, it has initiated a search for materials with high power output rather than conversion efficiency. For example, the rare earth compounds YbAl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; has a low figure-of-merit, but it has a power output of at least double that of any other material, and can operate over the temperature range of a waste heat source.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Novel processing ===
In order to increase the figure of merit (zT), a material’s thermal conductivity should be minimized while its electrical conductivity and Seebeck coefficient is maximized. In most cases, methods to increase or decrease one property result in the same effect on other properties due to their interdependence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Chatterji|first1=Tapan|title=Increasing the Thermoelectric Figure of Merit|url=https://www.researchgate.net/post/What_are_the_usual_techniques_methods_used_to_increase_the_thermoelectric_figure_of_merit_of_materials|website=ResearchGate|accessdate=8 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A novel processing technique exploits the scattering of different phonon frequencies to selectively reduce lattice thermal conductivity without the typical negative effects on electrical conductivity from the simultaneous increased scattering of electrons. In a bismuth antimony tellurium ternary system, liquid-phase sintering is used to produce low-energy semicoherent grain boundaries, which do not have a significant scattering effect on electrons.&lt;ref name="science article"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kim|first1=Sang|title=Dense dislocation arrays embedded in grain boundaries for high-performance bulk thermoelectrics|journal=Science|date=April 3, 2015|volume=348|issue=6230|pages=109–114|doi=10.1126/science.aaa4166|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/348/6230/109|accessdate=8 November 2016|pmid=25838382}}&lt;/ref&gt; The breakthrough is then applying a pressure to the liquid in the sintering process, which creates a transient flow of the Te rich liquid and facilitates the formation of dislocations that greatly reduce the lattice conductivity.&lt;ref name="science article"/&gt; The ability to selectively decrease the lattice conductivity results in reported zT values of 1.86 ± .15 which are a significant improvement over current commercial thermoelectric generators which have typical figures of merit closer to .3-.6.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kim|first1=D.S.|title=Solar refrigeration options – a state-of-the-art review|journal=International Journal of Refrigeration|date=January 2008|volume=31|issue=1|pages=3–15|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140700707001478|accessdate=8 November 2016|doi=10.1016/j.ijrefrig.2007.07.011}}&lt;/ref&gt; These improvements highlight the fact that in addition to development of novel materials for thermoelectric applications, using different processing techniques to design microstructure is a viable and worthwhile effort. In fact, it often makes sense to work to optimize both composition and microstructure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cojocaru-Mirédin|first1=Oana|title=Thermoelectric Materials Design by controlling the microstructure and composition|url=http://www.mpie.de/3219789/thermoelectric_materials_design|website=Max-Planck Institut|accessdate=8 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Efficiency==
The typical efficiency of TEGs is around 5–8%. Older devices used bimetallic junctions and were bulky. More recent devices use highly doped semiconductors made from [[bismuth telluride]] (Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Te&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), [[lead telluride]] (PbTe),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v489/n7416/full/nature11439.html High-performance bulk thermoelectrics with all-scale hierarchical architectures]&lt;/ref&gt; calcium manganese oxide (Ca&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Mn&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scripts.iucr.org/cgi-bin/paper?a21300 |title=calcium manganese oxide Ca&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Mn&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; |publisher=International Union of Crystallography |accessdate= 11 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espressomilkcooler.com/teg-cascade-800c-hot-side-thermoelectric-power-modules/|title=EspressoMilkCooler.com   –  TEG CMO 800°C  &amp; Cascade 600°C Hot Side Thermoelectric Power Modules|work=espressomilkcooler.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; or combinations thereof,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thermoelectric-generator.com/ultra_high_temperature_teg_power_modules.htm High Temp Teg Power Modules] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121217031344/http://www.thermoelectric-generator.com/ultra_high_temperature_teg_power_modules.htm |date=December 17, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; depending on temperature. These are solid-state devices and unlike [[dynamo]]s have no [[moving parts]], with the occasional exception of a fan or pump. For a discussion of the factors determining and limiting efficiency as well as ongoing efforts to improve the efficiency, see the article [[Thermoelectric materials#Device efficiency|Thermoelectric materials (device efficiency)]].

==Uses==
Thermoelectric generators have a variety of applications. Frequently, thermoelectric generators are used for low power remote applications or where bulkier but more efficient [[heat engine]]s such as [[Stirling engine]]s would not be possible. Unlike heat engines, the [[solid-state (electronics)|solid state]] electrical components typically used to perform thermal to electric energy conversion have no moving parts. The thermal to electric energy conversion can be performed using components that require no maintenance, have inherently high reliability, and can be used to construct generators with long service-free lifetimes.  This makes thermoelectric generators well suited for equipment with low to modest power needs in remote uninhabited or inaccessible locations such as mountaintops, the vacuum of space, or the deep ocean.  
*Common application is the use of thermoelectric generators on gas pipelines. For example, for cathodic protection, radio communication, and other telemetry. On gas pipelines for power consumption of up to 5&amp;nbsp;kW thermal generators are preferable to other power sources. The manufacturers of generators for gas pipelines are [http://www.gentherm.com Gentherm] Global Power Technologies (Formerly Global Thermoelectric), (Calgary, Canada) and TELGEN (Russia).
*Thermoelectric Generators are primarily used as remote and off-grid power generators for unmanned sites. They are the most reliable power generator in such situations as they do not have moving parts (thus virtually maintenance free), work day and night, perform under all weather conditions, and can work without battery backup. Although Solar Photovoltaic systems are also implemented in remote sites, Solar PV may not be a suitable solution where solar radiation is low, i.e. areas at higher latitudes with snow or no sunshine, areas with lots of cloud or tree canopy cover, dusty deserts, forests, etc.
*[http://www.gentherm.com Gentherm] Global Power Technologies (GPT) formerly known as Global Thermoelectric (Canada) has Hybrid Solar-TEG solutions where the Thermoelectric Generator backs up the Solar-PV, such that if the Solar panel is down and the backup battery backup goes into deep discharge then a sensor starts the TEG as a backup power source until the Solar is up again. The TEG heat can be produced by a low pressure flame fueled by Propane or Natural Gas.
*Many [[space probe]]s, including the [[Curiosity rover|Mars ''Curiosity'' rover]], generate electricity using a [[radioisotope thermoelectric generator]] whose heat source is a radioactive element.
*Cars and other automobiles produce [[waste heat]] (in the exhaust and in the cooling agents). Harvesting that heat energy, using a thermoelectric generator, can increase the fuel efficiency of the car. For more details, see the article: [[Automotive thermoelectric generator]].
*In addition to automobiles, waste heat is also generated in many other places, such as in industrial processes and in heating (wood stoves, outdoor boilers, cooking, oil and gas fields, pipelines, and remote communication towers).
* Microprocessors generate waste heat. Researchers have considered whether some of that energy could be recycled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1109/DATE.2008.4484669 | title=Harvesting Wasted Heat in a Microprocessor Using Thermoelectric Generators: Modeling, Analysis and Measurement | journal=2008 Design, Automation and Test in Europe}}&lt;/ref&gt; (However, see [[#Practical_limitations|below]] for problems that can arise.)
*Solar cells use only the high frequency part of the radiation, while the low frequency heat energy is wasted. Several patents about the use of thermoelectric devices in tandem with solar cells have been filed.&lt;ref name=Kraemer&gt;{{citation

==Practical limitations==

Besides low efficiency and relatively high cost, practical problems exist in using thermoelectric devices in certain types of applications resulting from a relatively high electrical output resistance, which increases self-heating, and a relatively low thermal conductivity, which makes them unsuitable for applications where heat removal is critical, as with heat removal from an electrical device such as microprocessors. 
* '''High generator output resistance:'''  In order to get voltage output levels in the range required by digital electrical devices, a common approach is to place many thermoelectric elements in series within a generator module. The element's voltages add, but so do their individual output resistance. The [[maximum power transfer theorem]] dictates that maximum power is delivered to a load when the source and load resistances are identically matched. For low impedance loads near zero ohms, as the generator resistance rises the power delivered to the load decreases. To lower the output resistance, some commercial devices place more individual elements in parallel and fewer in series and employ a boost regulator to raise the voltage to the voltage needed by the load. 
* '''Low thermal conductivity:''' Because a very high thermal conductivity is required to transport thermal energy away from a heat source such as a digital microprocessor, the low thermal conductivity of thermoelectric generators makes them unsuitable to recover the heat.
* '''Cold-side heat removal with air:''' In air-cooled thermoelectric applications, such as when harvesting thermal energy from a motor vehicle's crankcase, the large amount of thermal energy that must be dissipated into ambient air presents a significant challenge. As a thermoelectric generator's cool side temperature rises, the device's differential working temperature decreases. As the temperature rises, the device's electrical resistance increases causing greater parasitic generator self-heating. In motor vehicle applications a supplementary radiator is sometimes used for improved heat removal, though the use of an electric water pump to circulate a coolant adds an additional parasitic loss to total generator output power.  Water cooling the thermoelectric generator's cold side, as when generating thermoelectric power from the hot crank case of an inboard boat motor, would not suffer from this disadvantage. Water is a far easier coolant to use effectively in contrast to air.

== Future market ==
While TEG technology has been used in military and aerospace applications for decades, new TE materials and systems are being developed to generate power using low or high temperatures waste heat, and that could provide a significant opportunity in the near future. These systems can also be scalable to any size and have lower operation and maintenance cost.

In general, investing in TEG technology is increasing rapidly. The global market for thermoelectric generators is estimated to be US$320 million in 2015. A recent study estimated that TEG is expected to reach $720 million in 2021 with a growth rate of 14.5%. Today, [[North America]] capture 66% of the market share and it will continue to be the biggest market in the near future.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Global Thermoelectric Generator Market is estimated to cross US $720 million by 2021: by Market Research Engine|url = http://www.keyc.com/story/30294958/global-thermoelectric-generator-market-is-estimated-to-cross-us-720-million-by-2021-by-market-research-engine|website = www.keyc.com|accessdate = 2015-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Asia-Pacific and European countries are projected to grow at relatively higher rates. A study found that the Asia-Pacific market would grow at a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 18.3% in the period from 2015 to 2020 due to the high demand of thermoelectric generators by the automotive industries to increase overall fuel efficiency, as well as the growing industrialization in the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Thermoelectric Generators Market Worth 547.7 Million USD by 2020|url = http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/thermoelectric-generators-market-worth-5477-million-usd-by-2020-528044901.html|website = www.prnewswire.com|accessdate = 2015-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Low power TEG or "sub-watt" (i.e. generating up to 1 Watt peak) market is a growing part of the TEG market, capitalizing on latest technologies. Main applications are sensors, low power applications and more globally [[Internet of things]] applications. A specialized market research company indicated that 100 000 units have been shipped in 2014 and expects 9 million units per year by 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.analog-eetimes.com/news/sub-watt-thermoelectric-generator-market|title=Sub-watt thermoelectric generator market on the up|date=2016-03-15|access-date=2016-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4474">In [[condensed matter physics]], dealing with the macroscopic physical properties of matter, a '''tricritical point''' is a point in the [[phase diagram]] of a system at which [[phase equilibrium|three-phase coexistence]] terminates.&lt;ref&gt;B. Widom, ''Theory of Phase Equilibrium'', J. Phys. Chem. '''1996''', 100, 13190-13199&lt;/ref&gt; This definition is clearly parallel to the definition of an ordinary [[critical point (thermodynamics)|critical point]] as the point at which two-phase coexistence terminates.

A point of three-phase coexistence is termed a [[triple point]] for a one-component system, since, from [[Gibbs' phase rule]], this condition is only achieved for a single point in the phase diagram (''F'' = 2-3+1 ='''0'''). For tricritical points to be observed, one needs a mixture with more components. It can be shown&lt;ref&gt;''ibid''.&lt;/ref&gt; that three is the ''minimum'' number of components for which these points can appear. In this case, one may have a two-dimensional region of three-phase coexistence (''F'' = 2-3+3 ='''2''') (thus, each point in this region corresponds to a triple point). This region (F=2, P=3) will terminate in two critical lines of two-phase coexistence; these two critical lines (F=1, P=2) may then terminate at a single tricritical point. This point (F=0, P=1) is therefore "twice critical", since it belongs to two critical branches.&lt;br&gt;
Indeed, its [[critical behavior]] is different from that of a conventional critical point: the upper [[critical dimension]] is lowered from d=4 to d=3 so the [[Landau theory|classical exponents]] turn out to apply for real systems in three dimensions (but not for systems whose spatial dimension is 2 or lower).

&lt;/ref&gt; to consider mixtures with four components for which one thermodynamic variable (usually the pressure or the volume) is kept fixed. The situation then reduces to the one described for mixtures of three components.

Historically, it was for a long time unclear whether a [[superconduction|superconductor]] undergoes a first- or a second-order phase transition. The question was finally settled in 1982.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; If the  Ginzburg-Landau parameter &lt;math&gt;\kappa&lt;/math&gt; that distinguishes [[Type I superconductor|type-I]] and [[Type II superconductor|type-II]] superconductors (see also [[Ginzburg–Landau theory|here]]) is large enough, vortex fluctuations become important which drive the transition to ''second'' order.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
The tricritical point lies at roughly &lt;math&gt;\kappa=0.76/\sqrt{2}&lt;/math&gt;, i.e., slightly below the value &lt;math&gt;\kappa=1/\sqrt{2}&lt;/math&gt; where type-I goes over into type-II superconductor. The prediction was confirmed in 2002 by Monte Carlo [[Monte Carlo method|computer simulations]].&lt;ref&gt;

The '''University of Maine (UMaine) Deepwater Offshore Wind Test Site''', located nearly 3 miles south west of [[Monhegan Island]], [[Maine]] is available for use by commercial and non-commercial entities in partnership with the [[University of Maine]], or the University of Maine itself, to research and develop [[ocean energy]] devices, such as [[floating wind turbine]]s or [[wave energy]] converters.

The University of Maine asserts that the test site is among the most extensively studied in the Gulf of Maine.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web|title=UMaine Deepwater Offshore Wind Test Site|url=https://umaine.edu/offshorewindtestsite/|website=University of Maine|publisher=University of Maine|accessdate=21 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The site was established under Maine law in 2009. The legislation formally designates the test site as the "Maine Offshore Wind Energy Research Center."&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite web|last1=SP0545 LD 1465|title=An Act To Facilitate Testing and Demonstration of Renewable Ocean Energy Technology|url=https://umaine.edu/offshorewindtestsite/wp-content/uploads/sites/303/2017/02/LD_1465.pdf|publisher=124th Maine State Legislature|accessdate=21 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Maine Aqua Ventus I, GP, LLC, is pursuing a 12 MW demonstration offshore wind pilot project in the Test Site, with deployment and commercial operations planned for 2020.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Allowable Uses ==
The following research and development efforts are allowable in the UMaine Deepwater Offshore Wind Test Site, per LD 1465:&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
# A [[wind energy]] development project that uses a [[wind turbine]] to convert wind energy into electrical energy with no more than 2 wind energy turbines.

There are no enhanced limitations placed on traditional commercial or recreational uses within the test site.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

__FORCETOC__

==  Environmental and Ecological Surveys Completed at the Site ==
The University of Maine and its partners conducted a variety of ecological and environmental studies to characterize the UMaine Deepwater Offshore Wind Test Site, primarily between 2010 and 2013. Studies include baseline data on [[benthic]] [[invertebrate]]s, [[marine mammal]]s, birds, fish, and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://umaine.edu/offshorewindtestsite/scientific-surveys-results/|title=Baseline Physical and Ecological Studies Completed to Date|website=UMaine Deepwater Offshore Wind Test Site at Monhegan Island|publisher=University of Maine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Survey results were published in 2011 in a University of Maine-published report, entitled: "Maine Offshore Wind Report." The report was funded by the U.S. Department of Energy, National Science Foundation, Rockefeller Brothers Fund, and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://composites.umaine.edu/research/offshore-wind-report/|title=Maine Offshore Wind Report|website=Advanced Structures and Composites Center|publisher=University of Maine|accessdate=21 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hourly buoy data near the UMaine Deepwater Offshore Wind Test Site is available viewing and download from the [http://www.neracoos.org/datatools/realtime/all_data?platform=E01 Northeastern Regional Association of Coastal Ocean Observing Systems (NERACOOS) buoy E01]. Available real-time weather and ocean data includes winds, waves, visibility, air temperature, and water temperature at the UMaine Deepwater Offshore Wind Test Site.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.neracoos.org/|title=NERACOOS {{!}} weather {{!}} ocean {{!}} marine forecast {{!}} waves {{!}} buoy {{!}} marine weather {{!}} water temperature {{!}} wind|website=www.neracoos.org|language=en|access-date=2017-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:UMaine Deepwater Offshore Wind Test Site map.png|alt=UMaine Deepwater Offshore Wind Test Site map|thumb|350x350px|This University of Maine graphic shows the location and proximity of the UMaine Deepwater Offshore Wind Test Site with respect to Monhegan Island.]]

== Site Selection ==
The UMaine Deepwater Offshore Wind Test Site was designated to the University of Maine by the 124th [[Maine Legislature|Legislature of the State of Maine]] in 2009. As a result of recommendations from Governor [[John E. Baldacci]]'s Ocean Energy Task Force, the [[Maine Department of Conservation]] identified three locations off the coast of Maine as Wind Energy Test Areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Final Report of the Ocean Energy Task Force to Governor John E. Baldacci|date=2009|publisher=State of Maine|url=https://umaine.edu/offshorewindtestsite/wp-content/uploads/sites/303/2017/02/OETF_FinalReportAppendices.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sites were chosen following a public outreach process led by the [[Maine State Planning Office]] in cooperation with the Maine State Planning Office, Department of Environmental Protection, Department of Marine Resources, and the University of Maine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Designation of Offshore Wind Energy Test Areas|url=https://umaine.edu/offshorewindtestsite/wp-content/uploads/sites/303/2017/02/Monhegan-Test-Sites-Documents-law-etc..pdf|website=University of Maine|publisher=State of Maine Department of Conservation|accessdate=21 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2009, the Maine Department of Conservation designated the location off of Monhegan Island based on its distance from the mainland shore and greater water depths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Designation of Offshore Wind Energy Test Areas|url=https://umaine.edu/offshorewindtestsite/wp-content/uploads/sites/303/2017/02/Monhegan-Test-Sites-Documents-law-etc..pdf|website=University of Maine|publisher=State of Maine Department of Conservation|accessdate=21 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Site Selection Methodology ===
In September 2009, the Maine Department of Conservation released a document regarding the Maine Offshore Energy Demonstration Area Siting Initiative, which worked to establish several areas within Maine state waters that would be technically appropriate for an offshore wind demonstration area. The document stated that demonstration areas would be identified as a "three pronged approach," that would consider: geographical information system "showstoppers," human use and activities, and environmental considerations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Siting Offshore Energy in Maine|date=2009|publisher=Maine Department of Conservation|url=https://umaine.edu/offshorewindtestsite/wp-content/uploads/sites/303/2017/02/medoc_9-2-2009_overviewsitingprocess_0.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further, the document states: "Through a combination of [[Human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]], [[Natural environment|environmental]], and [[geophysical]] analyses, the State of Maine hopes to site these ocean energy testing and demonstration projects in areas with the fewest amount of conflicts, or at the very least, minimize what conflicts there will be. Adaptive Management will play a critical role in the duration of a project, or may affect how the project operates, once it is built."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Siting Offshore Energy in Maine|date=2009|publisher=Maine Department of Conservation|url=https://umaine.edu/offshorewindtestsite/wp-content/uploads/sites/303/2017/02/medoc_9-2-2009_overviewsitingprocess_0.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2009, the Maine Department of Conservation and Maine State Planning Office released a document that detailed site selection methodology for the Maine Offshore Energy Demonstration Area Siting Initiative.

The document outlines two phases. The first phrase focused on technical identification, public scoping sessions, and state consultation with state agencies. The second phase focused on map analysis (of ecological concerns, geology, obstructions, infrastructure, human uses of the marine environment, and viewshed) followed by a ranking process that gathered written and oral comments from a variety of sources, including fishermen, state agencies, and other interested parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Maine Offshore Energy Demonstration Area Siting Initiative - Site Selection Methodology|date=2009|publisher=Maine Department of Conservation|url=https://umaine.edu/offshorewindtestsite/wp-content/uploads/sites/303/2017/02/medoc_10-27-2009_siteselectionmethodology_0.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Matthew Nixon of the Maine State Planning Office provided a culminating presentation at a "Developer's Summit," sponsored by the University of Maine in February 2011, describing the technical identification process and more than 40 public scoping sessions held in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Nixon|first1=Matthew|title=The Ocean Energy Demonstration Siting Initiative|url=https://umaine.edu/offshorewindtestsite/wp-content/uploads/sites/303/2017/02/MCP_Siting_Presentation_2.22.11.pdf|website=University of Maine|publisher=Maine State Planning Office|accessdate=21 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Proposed Projects ==
Maine Aqua Ventus I, GP, LLC, is pursuing a 12 MW demonstration project in the test site. The project would feature two 6 MW wind turbines mounted on a University of Maine-developed [[VolturnUS (floating wind turbine)|VolturnUS]] floating concrete hull.

Sections of the VolturnUS will be fabricated in [[Hampden, Maine]], and [[Searsport, Maine]], and towed to the test site.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; An AC cable will join the turbines, and a subsea power cable will connect the test site to a point onshore. The project has a planned 20 year duration, as indicated in the project's [[Power Purchase Agreement]] draft term sheet with the Maine Public Utilities Commission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Maine Aqua Ventus I Proposed Term Sheet|url=http://maineaquaventus.com/images/mav_termsheet.pdf|website=Maine Aqua Ventus|accessdate=21 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Project participants include [[Emera|Emera, Inc.]], Cianbro Corporation, [[DCNS (company)|DCNS]], and the University of Maine. Deployment and commercial operation of the two units is currently planned for 2019.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|title=Offshore Wind|url=https://composites.umaine.edu/offshorewind/|website=Advanced Structures and Composites Center|publisher=University of Maine|accessdate=21 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception by Monhegan Island ==

[[Monhegan, Maine|Monhegan Island]] is located 12 nautical miles off the mainland. The population was 75 at the 2000 census. Monhegan Plantation created and authorized the Monhegan Energy Task Force to, "represent Monhegan in communications and negotiations with Maine Aqua Ventus regarding all aspects of the proposed offshore wind project, including the planning construction, operation, and decommissioning phases."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Monhegan Energy Task Force|url=http://www.monheganenergy.info/monhegan-energy-task-force/|website=Monhegan Energy Info|accessdate=21 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of their proposed contract with the [[Maine Public Utilities Commission]] through a [[Power purchase agreement|Power Purchase Agreement]], Maine Aqua Ventus has an obligation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Maine Aqua Ventus I Proposed Term Sheet|url=http://maineaquaventus.com/images/mav_termsheet.pdf|website=Maine Aqua Ventus|accessdate=21 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; to provide local benefit to [[Monhegan Island|Monhegan]] through a subsea cable interconnection with Central Maine Power or an alternative negotiated benefit. As of November 1, 2016, the Monhegan Energy Task Force contracted with law firm Eaton Peabody to negotiate the community benefits agreement with Maine Aqua Ventus.&lt;ref name="Monhegan Energy Task Force"&gt;{{cite web|title=Community Benefits Agreement Advisory Committee (CBAC) Formation and Progress to Date|url=http://www.monheganenergy.info/community-benefits-agreement-advisory-committee-cbac-formation-and-progress-to-date/|website=Monhegan Energy Info|publisher=Monhegan Energy Task Force|accessdate=21 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The test site and proposed project has created ongoing discussion on the Island, with residents considering potential impacts to their community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Trotter|first1=Bill|title=Monhegan prepares for wind power|url=http://bangordailynews.com/2010/10/28/business/monhegan-prepares-for-wind-power/|accessdate=21 February 2017|publisher=Bangor Daily News|date=October 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Community Response ===
In early July 2016, the Monhegan Energy Task Force conducted a survey to gauge community interest and sentiment towards Maine Aqua Ventus and the proposed offshore wind demonstration project. The survey broke results down between all respondents (registered voter, property owner, year-round resident, or seasonal worker) and exclusively Monhegan registered voters. The survey found that respondents were more supportive of the project (43.7%) versus opposed (40.2%) with a small percentage of undecided (16%). This support was found to be stronger among Monhegan Registered Voters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Results of a Survey of the Monhegan Community by the Monhegan Energy Task Force - July 2016|url=http://www.monheganenergy.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/METF-Survey-3-Report_FINAL.pdf|website=Monhegan Energy Task Force|accessdate=21 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The same survey asked if Monhegan Plantation should cease to engage with Maine Aqua Ventus overall. The Monhegan Energy Task Force reported that nearly 80% of Registered Voters should engage with Maine Aqua Ventus and pursue a community benefit agreement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Results of a Survey of the Monhegan Community by the Monhegan Energy Task Force - July 2016|url=http://www.monheganenergy.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/METF-Survey-3-Report_FINAL.pdf|website=Monhegan Energy Task Force|accessdate=21 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late July 2016, Monhegan Plantation held a special town meeting to see if the plantation to pursue development of a community benefits agreement with Maine Aqua Ventus. This vote passed with 31 to 1 registered voters in favor.&lt;ref name="Monhegan Energy Task Force"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Monthly Minutes|url=http://www.monheganplantation.com/monthly-minutes.html|website=Monhegan Plantation}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Balano, III|first1=James|title=In Praise of Maine Aqua Ventus|url=http://freepressonline.com/Content/Top-Scrolling-Area/Top-Scrolling-Area/Article/In-Praise-of-Maine-Aqua-Ventus/126/724/50539|accessdate=21 February 2017|publisher=The Free Pres|date=16 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A group called "Protect Monhegan," formed in November 2016, led by Monhegan resident Travis Dow, to express opposition to the Maine Aqua Ventus project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Turkel|first1=Tux|title=Small group of Monhegan residents renews fight against offshore turbines|url=http://www.pressherald.com/2016/11/01/monhegan-residents-renew-fight-against-off-shore-turbines/|publisher=Portland Press Herald|date=1 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 8, 2017, Maine State Senator [[Dana Dow]] (R-Damariscotta) issued a statement suggesting he would introduce a bill on behalf of "Protect Monhegan," to prohibit a wind energy test area within 10 miles of Monhegan Island's [[lobster]] conservation area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Maine lawmaker proposes ban on wind turbines near Monhegan|url=http://www.pressherald.com/2017/02/08/lawmaker-tried-to-prevent-wind-turbines-near-monhegan/|accessdate=21 February 2017|publisher=Portland Press Herald|date=8 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first1=Patti|title=Maine floater faces state fight|url=http://renews.biz/105864/maine-floater-faces-state-fight/|accessdate=21 February 2017|publisher=ReNews|date=9 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Formal bill language was not issued with the Senator's statement, made through the State's Republican party website.

On February 7, 2017, during a briefing of the State's joint legislative committee on Energy, Utilities, and Technology (EUT Committee), Dr. Habib Dagher of the University of Maine asserted that moving the test site would "kill the project."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=McCarthy|first1=James|title=Bill to protect Monhegan's iconic scenery would effectively 'kill' offshore wind pilot project|url=http://www.mainebiz.biz/article/20170220/CURRENTEDITION/302169997|accessdate=21 February 2017|publisher=MaineBiz|date=20 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Unstoppable: Harnessing Science to Change the World''''' is a 2015 [[book]] written by [[Bill Nye]] and edited by [[Corey S. Powell]]. Published by [[St. Martin's Press]], it is Nye's second book, after ''[[Undeniable: Evolution and the Science of Creation]]'', also with Powell, which was also published by St. Martin's Press in 2014.&lt;ref name="AP"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Kay |first1=Jennifer |title=Review: Bill Nye tackles climate change in new book|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/huff-wires/20151109/us--book-review-unstoppable/ |accessdate=5 January 2017|work=The Huffington Post|agency=Associated Press |date=9 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book is about how to use [[Environmental science|science to improve the environment]] and the challenges faced with [[global warming]] as well as raising the standard of living.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Unstoppable: A Conversation with Bill Nye the Science Guy |url = https://www.fi.edu/special-events/unstoppable-conversation-bill-nye-science-guy |publisher=[[Franklin Institute]] |accessdate = 2015-11-04}}{{dead link|fix-attempted=yes|date=January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception ==
[[BBC Future Media|BBC]] science columnist Rose Eveleth wrote a joint review in ''The New York Times'' of the audiobook versions of ''Unstoppable'' and [[Leonard Mlodinow]]'s 2015 book ''[[The Upright Thinkers]]''. Eveleth found Nye's audiobook "easy to listen to", noting the familiarity of Nye's voice to those who have watched the children's television series ''[[Bill Nye the Science Guy]]''. However, Eveleth wrote that both books "stumble" because they "recycle well-known material", describing how Nye "spends a good chunk of his book talking about the setup of his extremely energy-efficient home ... Some of these stories are relevant and interesting. Other times, they feel forced, as if both authors knew that without a personal touch, their books would read like any other general primer on climate change or great men in science."&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Eveleth|first1=Rose|title='The Upright Thinkers' and 'Unstoppable'|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/22/books/review/the-upright-thinkers-and-unstoppable.html |work=The New York Times |accessdate=23 January 2017 |date=18 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Simon Warthall, in the introduction to an interview with Nye for ''[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]]''{{'}}s "Book Talk" column, commented that ''Unstoppable'' "mixes science and [Nye's] trademark humor".&lt;ref name="natgeo"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Worrall |first1=Simon |title=Bill Nye the Science Guy Knows How to Fix Climate Change|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2015/11/151115-bill-nye-science-guy-climate-change-unstoppable-ngbooktalk/ |website=[[National Geographic Society|National Geographic]] |accessdate=23 January 2017 |date=15 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jennifer Kay, in a review for the [[Associated Press]], commented on the clarity of Nye's language, writing how "Nye explains the basics of climate science without making 'Unstoppable' feel like a textbook."&lt;ref name="AP" /&gt;

The '''VT-1 reactor''' was the [[nuclear fission]] [[nuclear reactor|reactor]] used in a pair to power [[Soviet submarine K-27]] as part of the [[Soviet Navy]]'s Project 645 Кит-ЖМТ. It is a [[liquid metal cooled reactor]] (LMR), using [[enriched uranium|highly enriched]] [[uranium-235]] fuel to produce 73 [[megawatt|MW]] of power.

K-27 was a [[November class submarine|November class]] first generation nuclear submarine, and the only one of its class fitted with liquid metal cooled reactors. However the seven-member [[Alfa class submarine|Alfa class]] were subsequently fitted with liquid metal cooled reactors.

It was developed by [[OKB Gidropress]] in cooperation with [[IPPE]].

[[File:Iceberg with hole near Sandersons Hope 2007-07-28 2.jpg|thumb|Water in two states: liquid (including the clouds, which are examples of [[aerosol]]s), and solid ([[ice]]).]]

'''Water''' is a transparent, tasteless, odorless, and nearly colorless [[chemical substance]], which is the main constituent of [[Earth]]'s streams, lakes, and oceans, and the [[fluid]]s of most living [[organism]]s. It is vital for all known forms of [[Life#Range of tolerance|life]], even though it provides no [[food energy|calories]] or [[organic compound|organic]] [[nutrient]]s. Its [[chemical formula]] is '''H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O''', meaning that each of its [[molecule]]s contains one [[oxygen]] and two [[hydrogen]] [[atom]]s connected by [[covalent bond]]s. Water is the name of the liquid state of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O at [[standard ambient temperature and pressure]]. It forms [[precipitation]] in the form of [[rain]] and [[aerosol]]s in the form of [[fog]]. [[Cloud]]s  &lt;!-- The first word in a sentence is always capitalized in English. --&gt; are formed from suspended droplets of water and [[ice]], its solid state. When finely divided, crystalline ice may precipitate in the form of [[snow]]. The gaseous state of water is [[steam]] or [[water vapor]]. Water moves continually through the [[water cycle]] of [[evaporation]], [[transpiration]] ([[evapotranspiration]]), [[condensation]], [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]], and [[Surface runoff|runoff]], usually reaching the sea.

Water covers 71% of the Earth's surface, mostly in seas and oceans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/xx.html#Geo |title=CIA – The world facctbook |publisher=[[Central Intelligence Agency]] |accessdate=20 December 2008 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/5nDzbMmsd?url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/xx.html#Geo |archive-date=1 February 2010 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Small portions of water occur as groundwater (1.7%), in the glaciers and the ice caps of Antarctica and Greenland (1.7%), and in the [[atmosphere|air]] as [[vapor]], clouds (formed of ice and liquid water suspended in air), and [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] (0.001%).&lt;ref name=b1&gt;{{cite book |title=Water in Crisis: A Guide to the World's Freshwater Resources |editor=Gleick, P.H. |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1993 |page=13, Table 2.1 "Water reserves on the earth" |url=http://www.oup.com/us/catalog/general/subject/EarthSciences/Oceanography/?view=usa&amp;ci=9780195076288 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130408091921/http://www.oup.com/us/catalog/general/subject/EarthSciences/Oceanography/?view=usa&amp;ci=9780195076288 |archivedate=8 April 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.agu.org/sci_soc/mockler.html Water Vapor in the Climate System] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070320034158/http://www.agu.org/sci_soc/mockler.html |date=20 March 2007 }}, Special Report, [AGU], December 1995 (linked 4/2007).

Much of long-distance trade of [[commodity|commodities]] (such as oil and natural gas) and manufactured products is transported by boats through seas, rivers, lakes, and [[canal]]s. Large quantities of water, ice, and steam are used for [[cooling]] and heating, in industry and homes. Water is an excellent [[solvent]] for a wide variety of chemical substances; as such it is widely used in industrial processes, and in cooking and [[washing]]. Water is also central to many sports and other forms of entertainment, such as swimming, [[pleasure boat]]ing, [[boat racing]], [[surfing]], [[sport fishing]], and [[Underwater diving|diving]].

The word "water" comes from [[Old English]] "wæter", from [[Proto-Germanic language|Proto-Germanic]] "*watar" (source also of [[Old Saxon]] "watar", [[Old Frisian]] "wetir", [[Dutch language|Dutch]] "water", [[Old High German]] "wazzar", [[German language|German]] "Wasser", [[Old Norse]] "vatn", [[Gothic language|Gothic]] "wato"), from [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indoeuropean]] "*wod-or", suffixed form of root "*wed-" ("water"; "wet").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?allowed_in_frame=0&amp;search=water |title=Water (v.) |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date= |website=www.etymonline.com |publisher=Online Etymology Dictionary |access-date=20 May 2017 |quote= |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170802204905/http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?allowed_in_frame=0&amp;search=water |archive-date=2 August 2017 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Brindis (24675281395).jpg|thumb|left|Liquid water, showing droplets and air bubbles caused by the drops]]
Water is a liquid at the temperatures and pressures that are most adequate for life. Specifically, at a standard pressure of 1 [[atmosphere (unit)|atm]], water is a liquid between {{convert|0|and|100|C}}. Increasing the pressure slightly lowers the [[melting point]], which is about {{convert|-5|C}} at 600 atm and {{convert|-22|C}} at 2100 atm. This effect is relevant, for example, to [[ice skating]], to the [[Lake Vostok|buried lakes of Antarctica]], and to the movement of [[glacier]]s. (At pressures higher than 2100 atm the melting point rapidly increases again, and ice takes several exotic forms that do not exist at lower pressures.)

Increasing the pressure has a more dramatic effect on the [[boiling point]], that is about {{convert|374|C}} at 220 atm. This effect is important in, among other things, deep-sea [[hydrothermal vents]] and [[geyser]]s, [[pressure cooking]], and [[steam engine]] design. At the top of [[Mount Everest]], where the atmospheric pressure is about 0.34 atm, water boils at {{convert|68|C}}.

At very low pressures (below about 0.006 atm), water cannot exist in the liquid state and passes directly from solid to gas by [[sublimation (phase transition)|sublimation]]—a phenomenon exploited in the [[freeze drying]] of food. At very high pressures (above 221 atm), the liquid and gas states are no longer distinguishable, a state called [[supercritical fluid|supercritical steam]].

Water also differs from most liquids in that it becomes less [[density|dense]] as it freezes. The maximum density of water in its liquid form (at 1&amp;nbsp;atm) is {{convert|1000|kg/m3|lb/cuft|sigfig=4|abbr=on}}; that occurs at {{convert|3.98|°C}}.&lt;ref name="NatureWaterStructure"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.academia.edu/2230441/Water_Water_an_enduring_mystery |title=Water: Water—an enduring mystery |access-date=15 November 2016 |publisher=Nature |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161117211552/http://www.academia.edu/2230441/Water_Water_an_enduring_mystery |archive-date=17 November 2016 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The density of ice is {{convert|917|kg/m3|lb/cuft|sigfig=4|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Kotz, J.C., Treichel, P., &amp; Weaver, G.C. |year=2005 |title=Chemistry &amp; Chemical Reactivity |publisher=Thomson Brooks/Cole |isbn=978-0-534-39597-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ben-Naim |first=Ariel |display-authors=etal |title=Alice's Adventures in Water-land |year=2011 |location=Singapore |doi=10.1142/8068 |last2=Ben-Naim |first2=Roberta |isbn=978-981-4338-96-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, water expands 9% in volume as it freezes, which accounts for the fact that ice floats on liquid water.

The details of the exact chemical nature of liquid water are not well understood; some theories suggest that water's unusual behaviour is as a result of it having 2 liquid states.&lt;ref name="NatureWaterStructure" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Maestro |first=L.M. |last2=Marqués |first2=M.I. |last3=Camarillo |first3=E. |last4=Jaque |first4=D. |last5=Solé |first5=J.

===Taste and odor===

Pure water is usually described as tasteless and odorless, although humans have specific sensors that can feel the presence of water in their mouths,&lt;ref name=emo&gt;Edmund T. Rolls (2005), "Emotion Explained". Oxford University Press, Medical. {{ISBN|0198570031}}, 9780198570035.&lt;/ref&gt; and frogs are known to be able to smell it.&lt;ref name=frog&gt;R. Llinas, W. Precht (2012), "Frog Neurobiology: A Handbook". Springer Science &amp; Business Media. {{ISBN|3642663168}}, 9783642663161&lt;/ref&gt; However, water from ordinary sources (including bottled mineral water) usually has many dissolved substances, that may give it varying tastes and odors. [[Humans]] and other animals have developed senses that enable them to evaluate the [[drinking water|potability]] of water by avoiding water that is too salty or [[putrid]].&lt;ref name=candau&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Candau |first1=Joël |year=2004 |title=The Olfactory Experience: constants and cultural variables |url=https://halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr/halshs-00130924 |journal=Water Science and Technology |volume=49 |issue=9 |pages=11–17 |access-date=28 September 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161002152229/https://halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr/halshs-00130924 |archive-date=2 October 2016 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Color and appearance===
The apparent color of natural bodies of water (and swimming pools) is often determined more by dissolved and suspended solids, or by reflection of the sky, than by water itself.

Light in the visible [[electromagnetic spectrum]] can traverse a couple meters of pure water (or ice) without significant [[optical absorption|absorption]], so that it looks [[transparency (optics)|transparent]] and colorless.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Braun |first=Charles L. |author2=Sergei N. Smirnov |title=Why is water blue? |journal=J. Chem. Educ. |volume=70 |issue=8 |page=612 |year=1993 |url=http://www.dartmouth.edu/~etrnsfer/water.htm |doi=10.1021/ed070p612 |bibcode=1993JChEd..70..612B |access-date=21 April 2007 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/66eKvCZUa?url=http://www.dartmouth.edu/~etrnsfer/water.htm |archive-date=3 April 2012 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus [[aquatic plant]]s, [[alga]]e, and other [[photosynthesis|photosynthetic]] organisms can live in water up to hundreds of meters deep, because [[sunlight]] can reach them. Water vapour is essentially invisible as a gas.

Through a thickness of {{convert|10|m|sp=us}} or more, however, the intrinsic [[color of water]] (or ice) is visibly turquoise (greenish blue), as its [[electromagnetic absorption by water|absorption spectrum]] has a sharp minimum at the corresponding color of light (1/227 m&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; at 418&amp;nbsp;nm). The color becomes increasingly stronger and darker with increasing thickness. (Practically no sunlight reaches the parts of the oceans below {{convert|1000|m|sp=us}} of depth.) Infrared and ultraviolet light, on the other hand, is strongly [[absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorbed]] by water.

The [[refraction index]] of liquid water (1.333 at {{convert|20|C}}) is much higher than that of air (1.0), similar to those of [[alkane]]s and [[ethanol]], but lower than those of [[glycerol]] (1.473), [[benzene]] (1.501), [[carbon disulfide]] (1.627), and common types of glass (1.4 to 1.6). The refraction index of ice (1.31) is lower than that of liquid water.

===Polarity and hydrogen bonding===
{{See also|Chemical bonding of H2O}}
[[File:3D model hydrogen bonds in water.svg|left|thumb|Model of [[hydrogen bond]]s (1) between molecules of water.]]
[[File:Capillarity.svg|upright|thumb|[[Capillary action]] of water compared to [[Mercury (element)|mercury]].]]
[[File:Water drop 001.jpg|right|thumb|Impact from a water drop causes an upward "rebound" jet surrounded by circular [[capillary wave]]s.]]

Since the water molecule is not linear and the oxygen atom has a higher [[electronegativity]] than hydrogen atoms, it is a [[polar molecule]], with an [[electrical dipole moment]]: the oxygen atom carries a slight negative charge, whereas the hydrogen atoms are slightly positive. Water is a good polar [[solvent]], that dissolves many [[salt (chemistry)|salts]] and [[hydrophilic]] organic molecules such as sugars and simple alcohols such as [[ethanol]]. Most [[acid]]s dissolve in water to yield the corresponding [[anion]]s. Many substances in living organisms, such as [[protein]]s, [[DNA]] and [[polysaccharide]]s, are dissolved in water. Water also dissolves many gases, such as oxygen and [[carbon dioxide]]—the latter giving the fizz of [[carbonation|carbonated]] beverages, [[sparkling wine]]s and beers.

On the other hand, many organic substances (such as [[lipids|fats and oils]] and [[alkanes]]) are [[hydrophobic]], that is, insoluble in water. Many inorganic substances are insoluble too, including most metal [[oxide]]s, [[sulfide]]s, and [[silicate]]s.

Because of its polarity, a molecule of water in the liquid or solid state can form up to four [[hydrogen bonds]] with neighboring molecules. These bonds are the cause of water's high [[surface tension]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Campbell |first=Neil A. |author2=Brad Williamson |author3=Robin J. Heyden |title=Biology: Exploring Life |publisher=Pearson Prentice Hall |year=2006 |location=Boston, Massachusetts |url=http://www.phschool.com/el_marketing.html |isbn=978-0-13-250882-7 |access-date=11 November 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141102041816/http://www.phschool.com/el_marketing.html |archive-date=2 November 2014 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and capillary forces. The [[capillary action]] refers to the tendency of water to move up a narrow tube against the force of [[gravity]]. This property is relied upon by all [[vascular plant]]s, such as trees.&lt;ref&gt;[http://science.jrank.org/pages/1182/Capillary-Action.html Capillary Action – Liquid, Water, Force, and Surface – JRank Articles] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130527124752/http://science.jrank.org/pages/1182/Capillary-Action.html |date=27 May 2013 }}. Science.jrank.org. Retrieved on 28 September 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

The hydrogen bonds are also the reason why the melting and boiling points of water are much higher than those of [[Hydrogen chalcogenide|other analogous compounds]] like [[hydrogen sulfide]] ({{chem|H|2|S}}). They also explain its exceptionally high [[specific heat capacity]] (about 4.2 [[joule|J]]/g/K), [[heat of fusion]] (about 333 J/g), [[heat of vaporization]] ({{nowrap|2257 J/g}}), and [[thermal conductivity]] (between 0.561 and 0.679 W/m/K). These properties make water more effective at moderating Earth's [[climate]], by storing heat and transporting it between the oceans and the atmosphere. The hydrogen bonds of water are of moderate strength, around 23 kJ/mol (compared to a covalent O-H bond at 492 kJ/mol). Of this, it is estimated that 90% of the hydrogen bond is attributable to electrostatics, while the remaining 10% reflects partial covalent character.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=1 March 2000|title=Compton scattering evidence for covalency of the hydrogen bond in ice|journal=Journal of Physics and Chemistry of Solids|volume=61|issue=3|pages=403–406|doi=10.1016/S0022-3697(99)00325-X|last1=Isaacs|first1=E.D|last2=Shukla|first2=A|last3=Platzman|first3=P.M|last4=Hamann|first4=D.R|last5=Barbiellini|first5=B|last6=Tulk|first6=C.A|bibcode=2000JPCS...61..403I}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Electrical conductivity and electrolysis===
Pure water has a low [[electrical conductivity]], which increases with the [[dissolution (chemistry)|dissolution]] of a small amount of ionic material such as [[sodium chloride|common salt]].

Liquid water can be split into the [[chemical element|elements]] hydrogen and oxygen by passing an electric current through it—a process called [[electrolysis of water|electrolysis]]. The decomposition requires more energy input than the [[standard enthalpy of formation|heat released by the inverse process]] (285.8 kJ/[[mole (unit)|mol]], or 15.9 MJ/kg).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ball |first=Philip |authorlink=Philip Ball |title=Burning water and other myths |url=http://www.nature.com/news/2007/070910/full/070910-13.html |journal=News@nature |date=14 September 2007 |accessdate=14 September 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090228054247/http://www.nature.com/news/2007/070910/full/070910-13.html |archive-date=28 February 2009 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all |doi=10.1038/news070910-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mechanical properties===

Liquid water can be assumed to be incompressible for most purposes: its compressibility ranges from 4.4 to {{val|5.1|e=-10|u=Pa&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;}} in ordinary conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Fine, R.A. |author2=Millero, F.J.|last-author-amp=yes |date=1973 |title=Compressibility of water as a function of temperature and pressure |volume=59 |issue=10 |page=5529 |journal=Journal of Chemical Physics |doi=10.1063/1.1679903 |bibcode=1973JChPh..59.5529F}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even in oceans at 4&amp;nbsp;km depth, where the pressure is 400 atm, water suffers only a 1.8% decrease in volume.&lt;ref name=nave&gt;{{cite web |title=Bulk Elastic Properties |author=Nave, R. |website=HyperPhysics |publisher=[[Georgia State University]] |url=http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/hph.html |accessdate=26 October 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071028155517/http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/hph.html |archive-date=28 October 2007 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[viscosity]] of water is about 10&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt; Pa·[[second|s]] or 0.01 [[Poise (unit)|poise]] at {{convert|20|C}}, and the [[speed of sound]] in liquid water ranges between {{convert|1400|and|1540|m/s|sp=us}} depending on temperature. Sound travels long distances in water with little attenuation, especially at low frequencies (roughly 0.03 [[decibel|dB]]/km for 1 k[[hertz|Hz]]), a property that is exploited by [[cetaceans]] and humans for communication and environment sensing ([[sonar]]).&lt;ref name=NPLcalc&gt;UK National Physical Laboratory, [http://resource.npl.co.uk/acoustics/techguides/seaabsorption/ Calculation of absorption of sound in seawater] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161003014920/http://resource.npl.co.uk/acoustics/techguides/seaabsorption/ |date=3 October 2016 }}.

===Reactivity===
Metallic elements which are more [[electropositivity|electropositive]] than hydrogen such as [[lithium]], [[sodium]], [[calcium]], [[potassium]] and [[caesium]] displace hydrogen from water, forming [[hydroxide]]s and releasing hydrogen. At high temperatures, carbon reacts with steam to form [[carbon monoxide]].

&lt;!-- Commented out because image was deleted: [[File:Water Distribution.jpg|thumb|Graphical illustration of the Earth's relative water distribution at various locations on or near its surface&lt;ref name="Garrison"&gt;{{cite book |author=Tom Garrison |title=Oceanography: An Invitation to Marine Science (7th Edition) |publisher=Yolanda Cossio |year=2009 |page= |isbn=978-0-495-39193-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;]] --&gt;
[[File:The Earth seen from Apollo 17.jpg|thumb|Water covers 71% of the Earth's surface; the oceans contain 96.5% of the Earth's water. The [[Antarctic ice sheet]], which contains 61% of all fresh water on Earth, is visible at the bottom. Condensed atmospheric water can be seen as clouds, contributing to the Earth's [[albedo]].]]

Hydrology is the study of the movement, distribution, and quality of water throughout the Earth. The study of the distribution of water is [[hydrography]]. The study of the distribution and movement of groundwater is [[hydrogeology]], of glaciers is [[glaciology]], of inland waters is [[limnology]] and distribution of oceans is [[oceanography]]. Ecological processes with hydrology are in focus of [[ecohydrology]].

The collective mass of water found on, under, and over the surface of a planet is called the [[hydrosphere]]. Earth's approximate water volume (the total water supply of the world) is {{convert|1.338|e9km3|e6mi3|sp=us}}.&lt;ref name=b1 /&gt;

Liquid water is found in [[body of water|bodies of water]], such as an ocean, sea, lake, river, stream, [[canal]], pond, or [[puddle]]. The majority of water on Earth is [[sea water]]. Water is also present in the atmosphere in solid, liquid, and vapor states. It also exists as groundwater in [[aquifer]]s.

Water is important in many geological processes. Groundwater is present in most [[rock (geology)|rocks]], and the pressure of this groundwater affects patterns of [[fault (geology)|faulting]]. Water in the [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]] is responsible for the melt that produces [[volcano]]es at [[subduction zone]]s. On the surface of the Earth, water is important in both chemical and physical [[weathering]] processes. Water, and to a lesser but still significant extent, ice, are also responsible for a large amount of [[sediment transport]] that occurs on the surface of the earth. [[Deposition (geology)|Deposition]] of transported sediment forms many types of [[sedimentary rock]]s, which make up the [[geologic record]] of [[History of the Earth|Earth history]].

===Water cycle===
{{Main|Water cycle}}
[[File:Water cycle.png|thumb|[[Water cycle]]]]

The [[water cycle]] (known scientifically as the hydrologic cycle) refers to the continuous exchange of water within the [[hydrosphere]], between the [[Earth atmosphere|atmosphere]], [[soil]] water, [[surface water]], [[groundwater]], and plants.

Water moves perpetually through each of these regions in the ''water cycle'' consisting of following transfer processes:
* [[evaporation]] from oceans and other water bodies into the air and [[transpiration]] from land plants and animals into air.
* [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]], from water vapor condensing from the air and falling to earth or ocean.
* [[runoff (water)|runoff]] from the land usually reaching the sea.
Most water vapor over the oceans returns to the oceans, but winds carry water vapor over land at the same rate as runoff into the sea, about 47&amp;nbsp;[[Metric tonne unit|Tt]] per year. Over land, evaporation and transpiration contribute another 72&amp;nbsp;Tt per year. Precipitation, at a rate of 119 Tt per year over land, has several forms: most commonly rain, snow, and [[hail]], with some contribution from [[fog]] and [[dew]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Water in Crisis: A Guide to the World's Freshwater Resources |editor=Gleick, P.H. |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1993 |page=15, Table 2.3 |url=http://www.oup.com/us/catalog/general/subject/EarthSciences/Oceanography/?view=usa&amp;ci=9780195076288 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130408091921/http://www.oup.com/us/catalog/general/subject/EarthSciences/Oceanography/?view=usa&amp;ci=9780195076288 |archivedate=8 April 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dew is small drops of water that are condensed when a high density of water vapor meets a cool surface. Dew usually forms in the morning when the temperature is the lowest, just before sunrise and when the temperature of the earth's surface starts to increase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Alice's Adventures in Water-land |author1=Ben-Naim, A. |author2=Ben-Naim, R., P.H. |lastauthoramp=yes |publisher=World Scientific Publishing |year=2011 |page=31 |doi=10.1142/8068 |isbn=978-981-4338-96-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Condensed water in the air may also [[refract]] [[sunlight]] to produce [[rainbow]]s.

Water runoff often collects over [[Drainage basin|watersheds]] flowing into rivers. A mathematical model used to simulate river or stream flow and calculate water quality parameters is a [[hydrological transport model]]. Some water is diverted to [[irrigation]] for agriculture. Rivers and seas offer opportunity for travel and commerce. Through [[erosion]], runoff shapes the environment creating river [[valley]]s and [[river delta|deltas]] which provide rich soil and level ground for the establishment of population centers. A flood occurs when an area of land, usually low-lying, is covered with water. It is when a river overflows its banks or flood comes from the sea. A drought is an extended period of months or years when a region notes a deficiency in its water supply. This occurs when a region receives consistently below average precipitation.

===Fresh water storage===
{{Main|Water resources}}
{{multiple image|perrow = 1|total_width=150
| image1 = Bay of Fundy High Tide.jpg  |width1=|height1=
| image2 = Bay of Fundy Low Tide.jpg |width2=|height2=
| footer = The [[Bay of Fundy]] at high tide (left) and low tide (right)}}
Some runoff water is trapped for periods of time, for example in lakes. At high altitude, during winter, and in the far north and south, snow collects in ice caps, snow packs and glaciers. Water also infiltrates the ground and goes into aquifers. This groundwater later flows back to the surface in [[spring (hydrosphere)|springs]], or more spectacularly in [[hot spring]]s and [[geyser]]s. Groundwater is also extracted artificially in [[water well|wells]]. This water storage is important, since clean, fresh water is essential to human and other land-based life. In many parts of the world, it is in short supply.

===Sea water and tides===
{{Main|Seawater|Tides}}
[[Seawater|Sea water]] contains about 3.5% [[sodium chloride]] on average, plus smaller amounts of other substances. The physical properties of sea water differ from fresh water in some important respects. It freezes at a lower temperature (about {{convert|-1.9|C}}) and its density increases with decreasing temperature to the freezing point, instead of reaching maximum density at a temperature above freezing. The salinity of water in major seas varies from about 0.7% in the [[Baltic Sea]] to 4.0% in the [[Red Sea]]. (The [[Dead Sea]], known for its ultra-high salinity levels of between 30–40%, is really a [[salt lake]].)

[[Tide]]s are the cyclic rising and falling of local sea levels caused by the [[tidal force]]s of the Moon and the Sun acting on the oceans. Tides cause changes in the depth of the marine and [[estuary|estuarine]] water bodies and produce oscillating currents known as tidal streams. The changing tide produced at a given location is the result of the changing positions of the Moon and Sun relative to the Earth coupled with the [[Coriolis effect|effects of Earth rotation]] and the local [[bathymetry]]. The strip of seashore that is submerged at high tide and exposed at low tide, the [[intertidal zone]], is an important ecological product of ocean tides.

==Effects on life==
[[File:Oasis in Lybia.JPG|thumb|left|An [[oasis]] is an isolated [[water source]] with vegetation in a [[desert]].]]
[[File:Auto-and heterotrophs.svg|thumb|right|Overview of [[photosynthesis|&lt;span style="color:green;"&gt;photosynthesis&lt;/span&gt;]] and [[cellular respiration|&lt;span style="color:red;"&gt;respiration&lt;/span&gt;]]. Water (at right), together with carbon dioxide (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), form oxygen and organic compounds (at left), which can be respired to water and (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;).]]

From a [[biology|biological]] standpoint, water has many distinct properties that are critical for the proliferation of life. It carries out this role by allowing [[organic compound]]s to react in ways that ultimately allow [[Self-replication|replication]]. All known forms of life depend on water. Water is vital both as a [[solvent]] in which many of the body's solutes dissolve and as an essential part of many [[metabolism|metabolic]] processes within the body. Metabolism is the sum total of [[anabolism]] and [[catabolism]]. In anabolism, water is removed from molecules (through energy requiring enzymatic chemical reactions) in order to grow larger molecules (e.g. starches, triglycerides and proteins for storage of fuels and information). In catabolism, water is used to break bonds in order to generate smaller molecules (e.g. glucose, fatty acids and amino acids to be used for fuels for energy use or other purposes). Without water, these particular metabolic processes could not exist.

Water is fundamental to photosynthesis and respiration. Photosynthetic cells use the sun's energy to split off water's hydrogen from oxygen{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}. Hydrogen is combined with CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (absorbed from air or water) to form glucose and release oxygen{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}. All living cells use such fuels and oxidize the hydrogen and carbon to capture the sun's energy and reform water and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in the process (cellular respiration).

Water is also central to acid-base neutrality and enzyme function. An acid, a hydrogen ion (H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, that is, a proton) donor, can be neutralized by a base, a proton acceptor such as a hydroxide ion (OH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;) to form water. Water is considered to be neutral, with a [[pH]] (the negative log of the hydrogen ion concentration) of 7. [[Acids]] have pH values less than 7 while [[Base (chemistry)|bases]] have values greater than 7.

===Aquatic life forms===
{{Further|Hydrobiology|Marine life|Aquatic plant}}
[[File:Blue Linckia Starfish.JPG|thumb|upright|Some of the [[biodiversity]] of a [[coral reef]]]]
[[File:Diatoms through the microscope.jpg|thumb|Some marine [[diatom]]s – a key [[phytoplankton]] group]]
Earth surface waters are filled with life. The earliest life forms appeared in water; nearly all fish live exclusively in water, and there are many types of marine mammals, such as dolphins and whales. Some kinds of animals, such as [[amphibian]]s, spend portions of their lives in water and portions on land. Plants such as [[kelp]] and [[algae]] grow in the water and are the basis for some underwater ecosystems. [[Plankton]] is generally the foundation of the ocean [[food chain]].

Aquatic vertebrates must obtain oxygen to survive, and they do so in various ways. Fish have [[gills]] instead of [[lungs]], although some species of fish, such as the [[lungfish]], have both. [[Marine mammal]]s, such as dolphins, whales, [[otter]]s, and [[pinniped|seals]] need to surface periodically to breathe air. Some amphibians are able to absorb oxygen through their skin. Invertebrates exhibit a wide range of modifications to survive in poorly oxygenated waters including breathing tubes (see [[Siphon (insect)|insect]] and [[Siphon (mollusc)|mollusc siphons]]) and [[gills]] (''[[Carcinus]]''). However as invertebrate life evolved in an aquatic habitat most have little or no specialisation for respiration in water.

==Effects on human civilization==
{{Refimprove section|date=May 2018}}
[[File:Longwood Gardens-Italian Garden.jpg|thumb|right|Water [[fountain]]]]

Civilization has historically flourished around rivers and major waterways; [[Mesopotamia]], the so-called cradle of civilization, was situated between the major rivers [[Tigris]] and [[Euphrates]]; the ancient society of the [[Egyptians]] depended entirely upon the [[Nile]]. Rome was also founded on the banks of the Italian river [[Tiber]]. Large [[metropolis]]es like [[Rotterdam]], London, Montreal, Paris, New York City, [[Buenos Aires]], Shanghai, Tokyo, Chicago, and Hong Kong owe their success in part to their easy accessibility via water and the resultant expansion of trade. Islands with safe water ports, like Singapore, have flourished for the same reason. In places such as North Africa and the Middle East, where water is more scarce, access to clean drinking water was and is a major factor in human development.

===Health and pollution===
[[File:Field Trip- water sampling.jpg|thumb|An environmental science program – a student from [[Iowa State University]] sampling water]]
Water fit for human consumption is called drinking water or [[potable water]]. Water that is not potable may be made potable by filtration or [[distillation]], or by a range of [[Water treatment|other methods]].

Water that is not fit for drinking but is not harmful for humans when used for swimming or bathing is called by various names other than potable or drinking water, and is sometimes called [[safe water]], or "safe for bathing". Chlorine is a skin and mucous membrane irritant that is used to make water safe for bathing or drinking. Its use is highly technical and is usually monitored by government regulations (typically 1 part per million (ppm) for drinking water, and 1–2 ppm of chlorine not yet reacted with impurities for bathing water). Water for bathing may be maintained in satisfactory microbiological condition using chemical disinfectants such as [[chlorine]] or [[ozone]] or by the use of [[ultraviolet]] light.

In the US, non-potable forms of [[wastewater]] generated by humans may be referred to as [[greywater]], which is treatable and thus easily able to be made potable again, and [[Blackwater (waste)|blackwater]], which generally contains [[sewage]] and other forms of waste which require [[Sewage treatment|further treatment]] in order to be made reusable. Greywater composes 50–80% of residential wastewater generated by a household's sanitation equipment ([[sink]]s, showers and kitchen runoff, but not toilets, which generate blackwater.) These terms may have different meanings in other countries and cultures.

This natural resource is becoming scarcer in certain places, and its availability is a major social and economic concern. Currently, about a billion people around the world routinely drink unhealthy water. Most countries accepted the goal of halving by 2015 the number of people worldwide who do not have access to safe water and [[sanitation]] during the [[29th G8 summit|2003 G8 Evian summit]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.g8.fr/evian/english/navigation/2003_g8_summit/summit_documents/water_-_a_g8_action_plan.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030608042310/http://www.g8.fr/evian/english/navigation/2003_g8_summit/summit_documents/water_-_a_g8_action_plan.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=8 June 2003 |title=G8 "Action plan" decided upon at the 2003 Evian summit |publisher=G8.fr |date=2 June 2003 |accessdate=25 July 2010 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even if this difficult goal is met, it will still leave more than an estimated half a billion people without access to safe drinking water and over a billion without access to adequate sanitation. Poor [[water quality]] and bad sanitation are deadly; some five million deaths a year are caused by polluted drinking water. The [[World Health Organization]] estimates that [[safe water]] could prevent 1.4 million child deaths from [[diarrhea]] each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/features/qa/70/en/ |title=World Health Organization.

Water, however, is not a finite resource (meaning the availability of water is limited), but rather re-circulated as potable water in precipitation&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=pba6tmIfiPgC&amp;pg=PA1815 |title=The Water Footprint of Modern Consumer Society |last=Hoekstra |first=Arjen Y. |date=19 June 2013 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-1136457043 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in quantities many orders of magnitude higher than human consumption. Therefore, it is the relatively small quantity of water in reserve in the earth (about 1% of our drinking [[water supply]],{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}} which is replenished in aquifers around every 1 to 10 years),{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}} that is a [[non-renewable resource]], and it is, rather, the distribution of potable and irrigation water which is scarce,{{clarify |date=January 2017 |reason= distribution can not be scarce, can be lacking, or inefficient, or unjust, or unfair}} rather than the actual amount of it that exists on the earth. Water-poor countries use importation of goods as the primary method of importing water (to leave enough for local human consumption),{{Elucidate|date=January 2017 |reason=water importation, via products? unclear for regular reader}} since the manufacturing process{{clarify |date=January 2017 |reason= which manufacturing process?}} uses around 10 to 100 times products' masses in water.{{clarify |date=January 2017 |reason= this whole paragraph needs amendment}}

In the developing world, 90% of all [[wastewater]] still goes untreated into local rivers and streams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Environmentally Sound Technology for Wastewater and Stormwater Management: An International Source Book |author=UNEP International Environment |year=2002 |publisher=IWA Publishing |isbn=978-1-84339-008-4 |oclc=49204666}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some 50 countries, with roughly a third of the world's population, also suffer from medium or high water stress, and 17 of these extract more water annually than is recharged through their natural water cycles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Climate Change and Developing Countries |last=Ravindranath |first=Nijavalli H. |author2=Jayant A. Sathaye |year=2002 |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-1-4020-0104-8 |oclc=231965991}}&lt;/ref&gt; The strain not only affects surface freshwater bodies like rivers and lakes, but it also degrades groundwater resources.

====Agriculture====
[[File:Subsurface drip emission on loamy soil.ogv|thumb|Water distribution in subsurface [[drip irrigation]]]]
[[File:SiphonTubes.JPG|thumb|right|[[Irrigation]] of field crops]]

The most important use of water in agriculture is for [[irrigation]], which is a key component to produce enough food. Irrigation takes up to 90% of water withdrawn in some developing countries&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wbcsd.org/includes/getTarget.asp?type=d&amp;id=MTYyNTA|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120301011840/http://www.wbcsd.org/includes/getTarget.asp?type=d&amp;id=MTYyNTA|dead-url=yes|archive-date=1 March 2012 |title=WBCSD Water Facts &amp; Trends |accessdate=25 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and significant proportions in more economically developed countries (in the United States, 30% of freshwater usage is for irrigation).&lt;ref name="Water Use in the United States"&gt;[http://nationalatlas.gov/articles/water/a_wateruse.html Water Use in the United States], National Atlas.gov  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090814045418/http://nationalatlas.gov/articles/water/a_wateruse.html |date=14 August 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fifty years ago, the common perception was that water was an infinite resource. At the time, there were fewer than half the current number of people on the planet. People were not as wealthy as today, consumed fewer calories and ate less meat, so less water was needed to produce their food. They required a third of the volume of water we presently take from rivers. Today, the competition for the fixed amount of water resources is much more intense, giving rise to the concept of [[peak water]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Gleick |first=P.H. |title=Peak Water |url=http://www.pacinst.org/press_center/press_releases/peak_water_pnas.pdf |accessdate=11 October 2011 |year=2010 |doi=10.1073/pnas.1004812107 |pmid=20498082 |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |volume=107 |issue=125 |pages=11155–11162 |last2=Palaniappan |first2=M. |bibcode=2010PNAS..10711155G |pmc=2895062 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111108224340/http://www.pacinst.org/press_center/press_releases/peak_water_pnas.pdf |archive-date=8 November 2011 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is because there are now nearly seven billion people on the planet, their consumption of water-thirsty meat and vegetables is rising, and there is increasing competition for water from industry, urbanisation and biofuel crops. In future, even more water will be needed to produce food because the Earth's population is forecast to rise to 9 billion by 2050.&lt;ref&gt;United Nations Press Release POP/952 (13 March 2007). [https://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2007/pop952.doc.htm World population will increase by 2.5 billion by 2050] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140727030018/http://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2007/pop952.doc.htm |date=27 July 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An assessment of water management in agriculture was conducted in 2007 by the [[International Water Management Institute]] in Sri Lanka to see if the world had sufficient water to provide food for its growing population.&lt;ref&gt;Molden, D. (Ed). ''Water for food, Water for life: [[A Comprehensive Assessment of Water Management in Agriculture]].'' Earthscan/IWMI, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; It assessed the current availability of water for agriculture on a global scale and mapped out locations suffering from water scarcity. It found that a fifth of the world's people, more than 1.2 billion, live in areas of [[physical water scarcity]], where there is not enough water to meet all demands. A further 1.6 billion people live in areas experiencing [[economic water scarcity]], where the lack of investment in water or insufficient human capacity make it impossible for authorities to satisfy the demand for water. The report found that it would be possible to produce the food required in future, but that continuation of today's food production and environmental trends would lead to crises in many parts of the world. To avoid a global water crisis, farmers will have to strive to increase productivity to meet growing demands for food, while industry and cities find ways to use water more efficiently.&lt;ref&gt;Chartres, C. and Varma, S. (2010) ''Out of water. From Abundance to Scarcity and How to Solve the World's Water Problems''. FT Press (US).&lt;/ref&gt;

Water scarcity is also caused by production of [[cotton]]: 1&amp;nbsp;kg of cotton—equivalent of a pair of jeans—requires {{convert|10.9|m3|sp=us}} water to produce. While cotton accounts for 2.4% of world water use, the water is consumed in regions which are already at a risk of water shortage. Significant environmental damage has been caused, such as disappearance of the [[Aral Sea]].&lt;ref&gt;waterfootprint.org/media/downloads/Report18.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

====As a scientific standard====
On 7 April 1795, the gram was defined in France to be equal to "the absolute weight of a volume of pure water equal to a cube of one hundredth of a meter, and at the temperature of melting ice".&lt;ref&gt;[http://smdsi.quartier-rural.org/histoire/18germ_3.htm Décret relatif aux poids et aux mesures. 18 germinal an 3 (7 April 1795)] {{Webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/6GVoZd4lp?url=http://smdsi.quartier-rural.org/histoire/18germ_3.htm |date=10 May 2013 }}. Decree relating to the weights and measurements (in French). quartier-rural.org&lt;/ref&gt; For practical purposes though, a metallic reference standard was required, one thousand times more massive, the kilogram. Work was therefore commissioned to determine precisely the mass of one liter of water. In spite of the fact that the decreed definition of the gram specified water at {{convert|0|C}}—a highly reproducible ''temperature''—the scientists chose to redefine the standard and to perform their measurements at the temperature of highest water ''density'', which was measured at the time as {{convert|4|C}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://histoire.du.metre.free.fr/fr/index.htm here L'Histoire Du Mètre, La Détermination De L'Unité De Poids] {{Webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/6GVoqCdnw?url=http://histoire.du.metre.free.fr/fr/index.htm |date=10 May 2013 }}. histoire.du.metre.free.fr&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Kelvin temperature scale]] of the [[International System of Units|SI]] system is based on the [[triple point]] of water, defined as exactly {{convert|273.16|K|C F}}. The scale is an [[absolute temperature]] scale with the same increment as the Celsius temperature scale, which was originally defined according to the [[boiling point]] (set to {{convert|100|C}}) and [[melting point]] (set to {{convert|0|C}}) of water.

Natural water consists mainly of the isotopes hydrogen-1 and oxygen-16, but there is also a small quantity of heavier isotopes such as hydrogen-2 ([[deuterium]]). The amount of deuterium oxides or [[heavy water]] is very small, but it still affects the properties of water. Water from rivers and lakes tends to contain less deuterium than seawater. Therefore, standard water is defined in the [[Vienna Standard Mean Ocean Water]] specification.

====For drinking====

Most of this is ingested through foods or beverages other than drinking straight water.

For those who have healthy kidneys, it is rather difficult to drink too much water, but (especially in warm humid weather and while exercising) it is dangerous to drink too little. People can drink far more water than necessary while exercising, however, putting them at risk of [[water intoxication]] (hyperhydration), which can be fatal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Noakes TD |author2=Goodwin N |author3=Rayner BL |display-authors=etal |title=Water intoxication: a possible complication during endurance exercise |journal=Med Sci Sports Exerc |year=1985 |volume=17 |issue=3 |pages=370–375 |pmid=4021781 |url=http://journals.lww.com/acsm-msse/Abstract/1985/06000/Water_intoxication__a_possible_complication_during.12.aspx |doi=10.1249/00005768-198506000-00012 |access-date=17 July 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120709091921/http://journals.lww.com/acsm-msse/Abstract/1985/06000/Water_intoxication__a_possible_complication_during.12.aspx |archive-date=9 July 2012 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Noakes TD, Goodwin N, Rayner BL, Branken T, Taylor RK |title=Water intoxication: a possible complication during endurance exercise, 1985 |journal=Wilderness Environ Med |year=2005 |volume=16 |issue=4 |pages=221–227 |pmid=16366205 |doi=10.1580/1080-6032(2005)16[221:WIAPCD]2.0.CO;2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The popular claim that "a person should consume eight glasses of water per day" seems to have no real basis in science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://ajpregu.physiology.org/cgi/content/full/283/5/R993 |title="Drink at least eight glasses of water a day."

An original recommendation for water intake in 1945 by the Food and Nutrition Board of the [[United States National Research Council]] read: "An ordinary standard for diverse persons is 1 milliliter for each calorie of food. Most of this quantity is contained in prepared foods."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Food and Nutrition Board, National Academy of Sciences. Recommended Dietary Allowances |publisher=National Research Council, Reprint and Circular Series, No. 122 |year=1945 |pages=3–18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The latest dietary reference intake report by the [[United States National Research Council]] in general recommended, based on the median total water intake from US survey data (including food sources): {{convert|3.7|L|sp=us}} for men and {{convert|2.7|L|sp=us}} of water total for women, noting that water contained in food provided approximately 19% of total water intake in the survey.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.nap.edu/read/10925/chapter/6|title=4 Water {{!}} Dietary Reference Intakes for Water, Potassium, Sodium, Chloride, and Sulfate {{!}} The National Academies Press|doi=10.17226/10925|year=2005|isbn=978-0-309-09169-5|last1=Medicine|first1=Institute of|last2=Board|first2=Food Nutrition|last3=Intakes|first3=Standing Committee on the Scientific Evaluation of Dietary Reference|last4=Water|first4=Panel on Dietary Reference Intakes for Electrolytes and|access-date=11 January 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170113063638/https://www.nap.edu/read/10925/chapter/6|archive-date=13 January 2017|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Specifically, pregnant and [[breastfeeding]] women need additional fluids to stay hydrated. The [[Institute of Medicine]] (US) recommends that, on average, men consume {{convert|3|L|sp=us}} and women {{convert|2.2|L|sp=us}}; pregnant women should increase intake to {{convert|2.4|L|sp=us}} and breastfeeding women should get 3 liters (12 cups), since an especially large amount of fluid is lost during nursing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/water/NU00283 |title=Water: How much should you drink every day? |publisher=Mayoclinic.com |accessdate=25 July 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101204012725/http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/water/NU00283 |archive-date=4 December 2010 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also noted is that normally, about 20% of water intake comes from food, while the rest comes from drinking water and beverages ([[Caffeine|caffeinated]] included). Water is excreted from the body in multiple forms; through [[urine]] and [[feces]], through [[sweat]]ing, and by exhalation of water vapor in the breath. With physical exertion and heat exposure, water loss will increase and daily fluid needs may increase as well.

Humans require water with few impurities. Common impurities include metal salts and oxides, including copper, iron, calcium and lead,&lt;ref&gt;''Conquering Chemistry'' 4th Ed. Published 2008&lt;/ref&gt; and/or harmful bacteria, such as ''[[Vibrio]]''. Some [[Solution|solutes]] are acceptable and even desirable for taste enhancement and to provide needed [[electrolyte]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Maton |first=Anthea |author2=Jean Hopkins |author3=Charles William McLaughlin |author4=Susan Johnson |author5=Maryanna Quon Warner |author6=David LaHart |author7=Jill D.

The single largest (by volume) freshwater resource suitable for drinking is [[Lake Baikal]] in Siberia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=1cV8tziHZ5sC&amp;pg=PA125 |page=125 |title=Water: a shared responsibility |author=Unesco |publisher=Berghahn Books |year=2006 |isbn=978-1-84545-177-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Washing====
The propensity of water to form [[Solvation|solutions]] and [[emulsion]]s is useful in various [[washing]] processes. Washing is also an important component of several aspects of personal [[body hygiene]]. Most of personal water use is due to [[shower]]ing, doing the [[laundry]] and [[dishwashing]], reaching hundreds of liters per day in developed countries.

====Transportation====
{{Main|Ship transport}}
The use of water for transportation of materials through rivers and canals as well as the international shipping lanes is an important part of the world economy.

====Chemical uses====
Water is widely used in chemical reactions as a [[solvent]] or [[reactant]] and less commonly as a [[solution|solute]] or [[catalyst]]. In inorganic reactions, water is a common solvent, dissolving many ionic compounds, as well as other polar compounds such as [[ammonia]] and [[Hydrogen chalcogenide|compounds closely related to water]]. In organic reactions, it is not usually used as a reaction solvent, because it does not dissolve the reactants well and is [[amphoteric]] (acidic ''and'' basic) and [[nucleophilic]]. Nevertheless, these properties are sometimes desirable. Also, acceleration of [[Diels-Alder reaction]]s by water has been observed. [[Supercritical water]] has recently been a topic of research. Oxygen-saturated supercritical water combusts organic pollutants efficiently. Water vapor is used for some processes in the chemical industry. An example is the production of acrylic acid from acrolein, propylene and propane.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The reaction network in propane oxidation over phase-pure MoVTeNb M1 oxide catalysts|journal=Journal of Catalysis|date=2014|volume=311|pages=369–385|url=http://pubman.mpdl.mpg.de/pubman/item/escidoc:1896844:6/component/escidoc:1896843/JCAT-13-716_revised_06Dec2013.pdf|doi=10.1016/j.jcat.2013.12.008|last1=Naumann d'Alnoncourt|first1=Raoul|last2=Csepei|first2=Lénárd-István|last3=Hävecker|first3=Michael|last4=Girgsdies|first4=Frank|last5=Schuster|first5=Manfred E|last6=Schlögl|first6=Robert|last7=Trunschke|first7=Annette|hdl=11858/00-001M-0000-0014-F434-5|access-date=14 January 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160215104605/http://pubman.mpdl.mpg.de/pubman/item/escidoc:1896844:6/component/escidoc:1896843/JCAT-13-716_revised_06Dec2013.pdf|archive-date=15 February 2016|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Surface chemistry of phase-pure M1 MoVTeNb oxide during operation in selective oxidation of propane to acrylic acid|journal=Journal of Catalysis|date=2012|volume=285|pages=48–60|url=http://pubman.mpdl.mpg.de/pubman/item/escidoc:1108560:8/component/escidoc:1402724/1108560.pdf|doi=10.1016/j.jcat.2011.09.012|last1=Hävecker|first1=Michael|last2=Wrabetz|first2=Sabine|last3=Kröhnert|first3=Jutta|last4=Csepei|first4=Lenard-Istvan|last5=Naumann d'Alnoncourt|first5=Raoul|last6=Kolen'Ko|first6=Yury V|last7=Girgsdies|first7=Frank|last8=Schlögl|first8=Robert|last9=Trunschke|first9=Annette|hdl=11858/00-001M-0000-0012-1BEB-F|access-date=14 January 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161030003154/http://pubman.mpdl.mpg.de/pubman/item/escidoc:1108560:8/component/escidoc:1402724/1108560.pdf|archive-date=30 October 2016|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Kinetic studies of propane oxidation on Mo and V based mixed oxide catalysts|date=2011|url=http://pubman.mpdl.mpg.de/pubman/item/escidoc:1199619:5/component/escidoc:1199618/csepei_lenard.pdf|access-date=14 January 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220044522/http://pubman.mpdl.mpg.de/pubman/item/escidoc:1199619:5/component/escidoc:1199618/csepei_lenard.pdf|archive-date=20 December 2016|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Multifunctionality of Crystalline MoV(TeNb) M1 Oxide Catalysts in Selective Oxidation of Propane and Benzyl Alcohol|journal=ACS Catalysis|date=2013|volume=3|issue=6|pages=1103–1113|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/278196177|doi=10.1021/cs400010q|last1=Amakawa|first1=Kazuhiko|last2=Kolen'Ko|first2=Yury V|last3=Villa|first3=Alberto|last4=Schuster|first4=Manfred E/|last5=Csepei|first5=Lénárd-István|last6=Weinberg|first6=Gisela|last7=Wrabetz|first7=Sabine|last8=Naumann d'Alnoncourt|first8=Raoul|last9=Girgsdies|first9=Frank|last10=Prati|first10=Laura|last11=Schlögl|first11=Robert|last12=Trunschke|first12=Annette}}&lt;/ref&gt; The possible effect of water in these reactions includes the physical-, chemical interaction of water with the catalyst and the chemical reaction of water with the reaction intermediates.

====Heat exchange====
Water and steam are a common fluid used for [[heat exchanger|heat exchange]], due to its availability and high [[Heat capacity of water|heat capacity]], both for cooling and heating. Cool water may even be naturally available from a lake or the sea. It's especially effective to transport heat through [[vaporization]] and [[condensation]] of water because of its large [[latent heat of vaporization]]. A disadvantage is that metals commonly found in industries such as steel and copper are [[oxidation|oxidized]] faster by untreated water and steam. In almost all [[thermal power station]]s, water is used as the working fluid (used in a closed loop between boiler, steam turbine and condenser), and the coolant (used to exchange the waste heat to a water body or carry it away by [[evaporation]] in a [[cooling tower]]). In the United States, cooling power plants is the largest use of water.&lt;ref name="Water Use in the United States" /&gt;

In the [[nuclear power]] industry, water can also be used as a [[neutron moderator]]. In most [[nuclear reactor]]s, water is both a coolant and a moderator. This provides something of a passive safety measure, as removing the water from the reactor also [[void coefficient|slows the nuclear reaction down]]. However other methods are favored for stopping a reaction and it is preferred to keep the nuclear core covered with water so as to ensure adequate cooling.

====Fire extinction====
[[File:MH-60S Helicopter dumps water onto Fire.jpg|right|thumb|Water is used for [[fire fighting|fighting]] [[wildfire]]s.]]
Water has a high heat of vaporization and is relatively inert, which makes it a good [[Fire fighting#Use of water|fire extinguishing]] fluid. The evaporation of water carries heat away from the fire. It is dangerous to use water on fires involving oils and organic solvents, because many organic materials float on water and the water tends to spread the burning liquid.

Use of water in fire fighting should also take into account the hazards of a [[steam explosion]], which may occur when water is used on very hot fires in confined spaces, and of a hydrogen explosion, when substances which react with water, such as certain metals or hot carbon such as coal, [[charcoal]], or [[coke (fuel)|coke]] graphite, decompose the water, producing [[water gas]].

The power of such explosions was seen in the [[Chernobyl disaster]], although the water involved did not come from fire-fighting at that time but the reactor's own water cooling system. A steam explosion occurred when the extreme overheating of the core caused water to flash into steam. A hydrogen explosion may have occurred as a result of reaction between steam and hot [[zirconium]].

====Recreation====
{{Main|Water sport (recreation)}}
[[File:Grand Anse Beach Grenada.jpg|thumb|right|Grand Anse Beach, St. George's, [[Grenada]], [[West Indies]]]]

Humans use water for many recreational purposes, as well as for exercising and for sports. Some of these include swimming, [[waterskiing]], [[boating]], [[surfing]] and [[Underwater diving|diving]]. In addition, some sports, like [[ice hockey]] and [[ice skating]], are played on ice. Lakesides, beaches and [[water park]]s are popular places for people to go to relax and enjoy recreation. Many find the sound and appearance of flowing water to be calming, and fountains and other water features are popular decorations. Some keep fish and other life in [[aquarium]]s or ponds for show, fun, and companionship. Humans also use water for snow sports i.e. [[skiing]], [[sledding]], [[snowmobiling]] or [[snowboarding]], which require the water to be frozen.

====Water industry====
[[File:Water carrier in India.jpg|thumb|upright|A water-carrier in India, 1882. In many places where running water is not available, water has to be transported by people.]]
[[File:TapWater-china.JPG|thumb|A manual water [[pump]] in China]]
[[File:Usine Bret MG 1648.jpg|thumb|[[Water purification]] facility]]
[[File:Reverse osmosis desalination plant.JPG|thumb|[[Reverse osmosis]] (RO) [[desalination]] plant in [[Barcelona]], Spain]]

The [[water industry]] provides drinking water and [[wastewater]] services (including [[sewage treatment]]) to households and industry. [[Water supply]] facilities include [[water well]]s, [[cistern]]s for [[rainwater harvesting]], [[water supply network]]s, and [[water purification]] facilities, [[water tank]]s, [[water tower]]s, [[water pipe]]s including old [[Aqueduct (watercourse)|aqueducts]]. [[Atmospheric water generator]]s are in development.

Drinking water is often collected at [[spring (hydrosphere)|springs]], extracted from artificial [[Boring (earth)|borings]] (wells) in the ground, or pumped from lakes and rivers. Building more wells in adequate places is thus a possible way to produce more water, assuming the aquifers can supply an adequate flow. Other water sources include rainwater collection. Water may require purification for human consumption. This may involve removal of undissolved substances, dissolved substances and harmful [[microbe]]s. Popular methods are [[filter (water)|filtering]] with sand which only removes undissolved material, while [[Water chlorination|chlorination]] and [[boiling]] kill harmful microbes. [[Distillation]] does all three functions. More advanced techniques exist, such as [[reverse osmosis]]. [[Desalination]] of abundant [[seawater]] is a more expensive solution used in coastal [[arid]] [[climate]]s.

The distribution of drinking water is done through [[municipal water system]]s, tanker delivery or as [[bottled water]]. Governments in many countries have programs to distribute water to the needy at no charge.

Reducing usage by using drinking (potable) water only for human consumption is another option. In some cities such as Hong Kong, sea water is extensively used for flushing toilets citywide in order to [[Water conservation|conserve fresh water resources]].

[[Water pollution|Polluting water]] may be the biggest single misuse of water; to the extent that a pollutant limits other uses of the water, it becomes a waste of the resource, regardless of benefits to the polluter. Like other types of pollution, this does not enter standard accounting of market costs, being conceived as [[externality|externalities]] for which the market cannot account. Thus other people pay the price of water pollution, while the private firms' profits are not redistributed to the local population, victims of this pollution. [[Pharmaceuticals]] consumed by humans often end up in the waterways and can have detrimental effects on [[marine biology|aquatic]] life if they [[bioaccumulation|bioaccumulate]] and if they are not [[biodegradable]].

Municipal and industrial wastewater are typically treated at [[wastewater treatment plant]]s. Mitigation of polluted [[surface runoff]] is addressed through a variety of prevention and treatment techniques. (''See'' [[Surface runoff#Mitigation and treatment]].)

====Industrial applications====
Many industrial processes rely on reactions using chemicals dissolved in water, suspension of solids in water [[slurry|slurries]] or using water to dissolve and extract substances, or to wash products or process equipment. Processes such as [[mining]], [[chemical pulping]], [[pulp bleaching]], [[paper manufacturing]], textile production, dyeing, printing, and cooling of power plants use large amounts of water, requiring a dedicated water source, and often cause significant water pollution.

Water is used in [[power generation]]. [[Hydroelectricity]] is electricity obtained from [[hydropower]]. Hydroelectric power comes from water driving a water turbine connected to a generator. Hydroelectricity is a low-cost, non-polluting, renewable energy source. The energy is supplied by the motion of water. Typically a dam is constructed on a river, creating an artificial lake behind it. Water flowing out of the lake is forced through turbines that turn generators.

{{wide image|200407-sandouping-sanxiadaba-4.med.jpg|800px|[[Three Gorges Dam]] is the [[List of the largest hydroelectric power stations|largest hydro-electric power station]].}}

Pressurized water is used in [[Hydrodemolition|water blasting]] and [[water jet cutter]]s. Also, very high pressure water guns are used for precise cutting. It works very well, is relatively safe, and is not harmful to the environment. It is also used in the cooling of machinery to prevent overheating, or prevent saw blades from overheating.

Water is also used in many industrial processes and machines, such as the [[steam turbine]] and [[heat exchanger]], in addition to its use as a chemical [[solvent]]. Discharge of untreated water from industrial uses is [[water pollution|pollution]]. Pollution includes discharged solutes (chemical pollution) and discharged coolant water ([[thermal pollution]]). Industry requires pure water for many applications and utilizes a variety of purification techniques both in water supply and discharge.

====Food processing====
[[File:Cuisson des pates.jpg|thumb|Water can be used to cook foods such as [[noodles]]]]

[[Boiling]], [[steaming]], and [[simmering]] are popular cooking methods that often require immersing food in water or its gaseous state, steam.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=xZHUAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA54|title=A Course in Household Arts: Part I|last=Duff|first=Sister Loretto Basil|date=1916|publisher=Whitcomb &amp; Barrows}}&lt;/ref&gt; Water is also used for [[dishwashing]]. Water also plays many critical roles within the field of [[food science]]. It is important for a food scientist to understand the roles that water plays within food processing to ensure the success of their products.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

[[Solution|Solutes]] such as salts and sugars found in water affect the physical properties of water. The boiling and freezing points of water are affected by solutes, as well as [[air pressure]], which is in turn affected by altitude. Water boils at lower temperatures with the lower air pressure that occurs at higher elevations. One [[mole (unit)|mole]] of sucrose (sugar) per kilogram of water raises the boiling point of water by {{convert|0.51|C-change|3}}, and one mole of salt per kg raises the boiling point by {{convert|1.02|C-change|3}}; similarly, increasing the number of dissolved particles lowers water's freezing point.&lt;ref name="vaclacik"&gt;{{cite book |title=Essentials of Food Science |url=https://books.google.com/?id=iCCsvwZrguUC&amp;printsec=frontcover |year=2007 |author1=Vaclavik, Vickie A. |author2=Christian, Elizabeth W |lastauthoramp=yes |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-0-387-69939-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Solutes in water also affect water activity that affects many chemical reactions and the growth of microbes in food.&lt;ref name="deman"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=kDYJ7a1HbD0C&amp;pg=PA434 |title=Principles of Food Chemistry |year=1999 |author=DeMan, John M |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-0-8342-1234-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Water activity can be described as a ratio of the vapor pressure of water in a solution to the vapor pressure of pure water.&lt;ref name="vaclacik" /&gt; Solutes in water lower water activity—this is important to know because most bacterial growth ceases at low levels of water activity.&lt;ref name="deman" /&gt; Not only does microbial growth affect the safety of food, but also the preservation and shelf life of food.

Water hardness is also a critical factor in food processing and may be altered or treated by using a chemical ion exchange system. It can dramatically affect the quality of a product, as well as playing a role in sanitation. Water hardness is classified based on concentration of calcium carbonate the water contains. Water is classified as soft if it contains less than 100&amp;nbsp;mg/l (UK)&lt;ref name="DEFRA"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dwi.defra.gov.uk/consumers/advice-leaflets/hardness_map.pdf |title=Map showing the rate of hardness in mg/l as Calcium carbonate in England and Wales |publisher=DEFRA/ Drinking Water Inspectorate |date=2009 |access-date=18 May 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150529054911/http://dwi.defra.gov.uk/consumers/advice-leaflets/hardness_map.pdf |archive-date=29 May 2015 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; or less than 60&amp;nbsp;mg/l (US).&lt;ref name="USGS"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://water.usgs.gov/edu/hardness.html |publisher=US Geological Service |title=Water hardness |date=8 April 2014 |access-date=18 May 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518204909/https://water.usgs.gov/edu/hardness.html |archive-date=18 May 2015 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a report published by the Water Footprint organization in 2010, a single kilogram of beef requires {{convert|15|e3L|e3impgal+e3usgal|sp=us}} of water; however, the authors also make clear that this is a global average and circumstantial factors determine the amount of water used in beef production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The green, blue and grey water footprint of farm animals and animal products, Value of Water Research Report Series No. 48 – Volume 1: Main report |url=http://www.waterfootprint.org/Reports/Report-48-WaterFootprint-AnimalProducts-Vol1.pdf |publisher=UNESCO – IHE Institute for Water Education |accessdate=30 January 2014 |author=M.M.

Much of the universe's water is produced as a byproduct of [[star formation]]. The formation of stars is accompanied by a strong outward wind of gas and dust. When this outflow of material eventually impacts the surrounding gas, the shock waves that are created compress and heat the gas. The water observed is quickly produced in this warm dense gas.&lt;ref&gt;Melnick, Gary, [[Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics]] and Neufeld, David, [[Johns Hopkins University]] quoted in:

On 22 July 2011, a report described the discovery of a gigantic cloud of water vapor containing "140 trillion times more water than all of Earth's oceans combined" around a [[quasar]] located 12 billion light years from Earth. According to the researchers, the "discovery shows that water has been prevalent in the universe for nearly its entire existence".&lt;ref name="Clavin"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Clavin |first1=Whitney |last2=Buis |first2=Alan |title=Astronomers Find Largest, Most Distant Reservoir of Water |url=http://www.nasa.gov/topics/universe/features/universe20110722.html |date=22 July 2011 |publisher=[[NASA]] |accessdate=25 July 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724063244/http://www.nasa.gov/topics/universe/features/universe20110722.html |archive-date=24 July 2011 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="water vapor cloud"&gt;{{cite web |author=Staff |title=Astronomers Find Largest, Oldest Mass of Water in Universe |url=http://www.space.com/12400-universe-biggest-oldest-cloud-water.html |date=22 July 2011 |publisher=[[Space.com]] |accessdate=23 July 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111029230319/http://www.space.com/12400-universe-biggest-oldest-cloud-water.html |archive-date=29 October 2011 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Water has been detected in [[interstellar cloud]]s within our [[galaxy]], the [[Milky Way]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=m1gfe459yygC&amp;pg=PA90 |title=Faint Echoes, Distant Stars: The Science and Politics of Finding Life Beyond Earth |last=Bova |first=Ben |date=13 October 2009 |publisher=Zondervan |isbn=9780061854484}}&lt;/ref&gt; Water probably exists in abundance in other galaxies, too, because its components, hydrogen and oxygen, are among the most abundant elements in the universe. Based on models of the [[formation and evolution of the Solar System]] and that of other star systems, most other [[planetary system]]s are likely to have similar ingredients.

====Exotic forms====
Water and other [[volatiles]] probably comprise much of the internal structures of [[Uranus]] and [[Neptune]] and the water in the deeper layers may be in the form of [[ionic water]] in which the molecules break down into a soup of hydrogen and oxygen ions, and deeper still as [[superionic water]] in which the oxygen crystallises but the hydrogen ions float about freely within the oxygen lattice.&lt;ref name="newscientist.com"&gt;[https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20727764.500-weird-water-lurking-inside-giant-planets.html Weird water lurking inside giant planets] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150415160045/http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20727764.500-weird-water-lurking-inside-giant-planets.html |date=15 April 2015 }}, ''New Scientist'', 1 September 2010, Magazine issue 2776.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Water and habitable zone===
{{Further|Water distribution on Earth}}

The existence of liquid water, and to a lesser extent its gaseous and solid forms, on Earth are vital to the existence of [[Organism|life on Earth]] as we know it. The Earth is located in the [[habitable zone]] of the [[solar system]]; if it were slightly closer to or farther from the [[Sun]] (about 5%, or about 8 million kilometers), the conditions which allow the three forms to be present simultaneously would be far less likely to exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter=J.C.I. Dooge.

Earth's [[gravity]] allows it to hold an [[Celestial body atmosphere|atmosphere]]. Water vapor and carbon dioxide in the atmosphere provide a temperature buffer ([[greenhouse effect]]) which helps maintain a relatively steady surface temperature. If Earth were smaller, a thinner atmosphere would allow temperature extremes, thus preventing the accumulation of water except in [[polar ice cap]]s (as on [[Mars]]).{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}

The surface temperature of Earth has been relatively constant through [[geologic time]] despite varying levels of incoming solar radiation ([[insolation]]), indicating that a dynamic process governs Earth's temperature via a combination of greenhouse gases and surface or atmospheric [[albedo]]. This proposal is known as the ''[[Gaia hypothesis]]''.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}

The state of water on a planet depends on ambient pressure, which is determined by the planet's gravity. If a planet is sufficiently massive, the water on it may be solid even at high temperatures, because of the high pressure caused by gravity, as it was observed on exoplanets [[Gliese 436 b]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |magazine=New Scientist |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn11864-strange-alien-world-made-of-hot-ice-and-steam.html |title=Strange alien world made of "hot ice" |date=6 May 2007 |first=David |last=Shiga |accessdate=28 March 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080706143705/http://space.newscientist.com/article/dn11864-strange-alien-world-made-of-hot-ice-and-steam.html |archivedate=6 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[GJ 1214 b]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cfa.harvard.edu/news/2009/pr200924.html |title=Astronomers Find Super-Earth Using Amateur, Off-the-Shelf Technology |author=Aguilar, David A. |date=16 December 2009 |publisher=Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics |accessdate=28 March 2010 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/66sgAVTw2?url=http://www.cfa.harvard.edu/news/2009/pr200924.html |archive-date=13 April 2012 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Water politics]] is politics affected by water and [[water resources]]. For this reason, water is a strategic resource in the globe and an important element in many political conflicts. It causes health impacts and damage to biodiversity.

Access to safe drinking water has improved over the last decades in almost every part of the world, but approximately one billion people still lack access to safe water and over 2.5 billion lack access to adequate [[sanitation]].&lt;ref name=UN /&gt; However, some observers have estimated that by 2025 more than half of the [[world population]] will be facing water-based vulnerability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Kulshreshtha, S.N |year=1998 |title=A Global Outlook for Water Resources to the Year 2025 |journal=Water Resources Management |volume=12 |issue=3 |pages=167–184 |doi=10.1023/A:1007957229865}}&lt;/ref&gt; A report, issued in November 2009, suggests that by 2030, in some developing regions of the world, water demand will exceed supply by 50%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mckinsey.com/App_Media/Reports/Water/Charting_Our_Water_Future_Full_Report_001.pdf |title=Charting Our Water Future: Economic frameworks to inform decision-making |format=PDF |accessdate=25 July 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100705072816/http://www.mckinsey.com/App_Media/Reports/Water/Charting_Our_Water_Future_Full_Report_001.pdf |archivedate=5 July 2010 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2006 United Nations report stated that "there is enough water for everyone", but that access to it is hampered by mismanagement and corruption.&lt;ref&gt;[[UNESCO]], (2006), [http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0014/001444/144409E.pdf Water, a shared responsibility.

The authors of the 2007 [[Comprehensive Assessment of Water Management in Agriculture]] cited poor governance as one reason for some forms of water scarcity. Water governance is the set of formal and informal processes through which decisions related to water management are made. Good water governance is primarily about knowing what processes work best in a particular physical and socioeconomic context. Mistakes have sometimes been made by trying to apply 'blueprints' that work in the developed world to developing world locations and contexts. The Mekong river is one example; a review by the [[International Water Management Institute]] of policies in six countries that rely on the Mekong river for water found that thorough and transparent cost-benefit analyses and environmental impact assessments were rarely undertaken. They also discovered that Cambodia's draft water law was much more complex than it needed to be.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iwmi.cgiar.org/Publications/Water_Issue_Briefs/index.aspx |title=Search Results |website=International Water Management Institute (IWMI) |accessdate=3 March 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130605124732/http://www.iwmi.cgiar.org/Publications/Water_Issue_Briefs/index.aspx |archive-date=5 June 2013 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[UN World Water Development Report]] (WWDR, 2003) from the [[World Water Assessment Program]] indicates that, in the next 20 years, the quantity of water available to everyone is predicted to decrease by 30%. 40% of the world's inhabitants currently have insufficient fresh water for minimal [[hygiene]]. More than 2.2 million people died in 2000 from [[waterborne diseases]] (related to the consumption of contaminated water) or drought. In 2004, the UK charity [[WaterAid]] reported that a child dies every 15 seconds from easily preventable water-related diseases; often this means lack of [[sewage]] disposal; see toilet.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}

Organizations concerned with water protection include the [[International Water Association]] (IWA), [[WaterAid]], [[Water 1st]], and the American Water Resources Association. The [[International Water Management Institute]] undertakes projects with the aim of using effective water management to reduce poverty. Water related conventions are [[United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification]] (UNCCD), [[International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships]], [[United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea]] and [[Ramsar Convention]]. [[World Day for Water]] takes place on 22 March and [[World Ocean Day]] on 8 June.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}

==In culture==

===Religion===
{{Main|Water and religion}}
Water is considered a purifier in most religions. Faiths that incorporate ritual washing ([[Ritual purification|ablution]]) include [[Christianity]], [[Hinduism]], [[Islam]], [[Judaism]], the [[Rastafari movement]], [[Shinto]], [[Taoism]], and [[Wicca]]. Immersion (or [[aspersion]] or [[affusion]]) of a person in water is a central [[sacrament]] of Christianity (where it is called [[baptism]]); it is also a part of the practice of other religions, including Islam (''[[Ghusl]]''), Judaism (''[[mikvah]]'') and [[Sikhism]] (''[[Amrit Sanskar]]''). In addition, a ritual bath in pure water is performed for the dead in many religions including Islam and Judaism. In Islam, the five daily prayers can be done in most cases after completing washing certain parts of the body using clean water (''[[wudu]]''), unless water is unavailable (see ''[[Tayammum]]''). In Shinto, water is used in almost all rituals to cleanse a person or an area (e.g., in the ritual of ''[[misogi]]'').

In Christianity, [[holy water]] is water that has been sanctified by a priest for the purpose of [[baptism]], the [[Blessing (Roman Catholic Church)|blessing]] of persons, places, and objects, or as a means of repelling evil.&lt;ref&gt;''Chambers's encyclopædia'', Lippincott &amp; Co (1870). p. 394.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Altman, Nathaniel (2002) ''Sacred water: the spiritual source of life''. pp. 130–133. {{ISBN|1-58768-013-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Zoroastrianism]], water (''[[aban|āb]]'') is respected as the source of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=ĀB i. The concept of water in ancient Iran – Encyclopaedia Iranica |url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/ab-i-the-concept-of-water-in-ancient-iranian-culture |website=www.iranicaonline.org |publisher=[[Encyclopedia Iranica]] |accessdate=19 September 2018 |language=en |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180516223930/http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/ab-i-the-concept-of-water-in-ancient-iranian-culture |archive-date=16 May 2018 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Philosophy===
The Ancient Greek philosopher [[Empedocles]] held that water is one of the four [[classical elements]] along with fire, earth and [[Air (classical element)|air]], and was regarded as the [[ylem]], or basic substance of the universe. [[Thales]], who was portrayed by Aristotle as an astronomer and an engineer, theorized that the earth, which is denser than water, emerged from the water. Thales, a [[monist]], believed further that all things are made from water. Plato believed the shape of water is an [[icosahedron]] which accounts for why it is able to flow easily compared to the cube-shaped earth.&lt;ref&gt;Lindberg, D. (2008). ''The beginnings of western science: The European scientific tradition in philosophical, religious, and institutional context, prehistory to A.D. 1450''. (2nd ed.). Chicago: University of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the theory of the [[humorism|four bodily humors]], water was associated with [[phlegm]], as being cold and moist. The [[Water (classical element)|classical element of water]] was also one of the [[Five elements (Chinese philosophy)|five elements]] in traditional [[Chinese philosophy]], along with [[earth (classical element)|earth]], [[fire (classical element)|fire]], [[wood (classical element)|wood]], and [[metal (classical element)|metal]].

Water is also taken as a role model in some parts of traditional and popular Asian philosophy. James Legge's 1891 translation of the ''Dao De Jing'' states, "The highest excellence is like (that of) water. The excellence of water appears in its benefiting all things, and in its occupying, without striving (to the contrary), the low place which all men dislike. Hence (its way) is near to (that of) the Tao" and "There is nothing in the world more soft and weak than water, and yet for attacking things that are firm and strong there is nothing that can take precedence of it—for there is nothing (so effectual) for which it can be changed."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/tao/taote.htm |title=Internet Sacred Text Archive Home |publisher=Sacred-texts.com |accessdate=25 July 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100712103909/http://www.sacred-texts.com/tao/taote.htm |archive-date=12 July 2010 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Guanzi (text)|Guanzi]]'' in "Shui di" 水地 chapter further elaborates on symbolism of water, proclaiming that "man is water" and attributing natural qualities of the people of different Chinese regions to the character of local water resources.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ctext.org/guanzi/shui-di Guanzi : Shui Di – Chinese Text Project] {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20141106133901/http://ctext.org/guanzi/shui-di |date=6 November 2014 }}.

===Dihydrogen monoxide hoax===
{{Main|Dihydrogen monoxide hoax}}
Water's technically correct but rarely used [[chemical name]], "dihydrogen monoxide", has been used in a series of [[hoaxes]] and [[pranks]] that mock [[scientific illiteracy]]. This began in 1983, when an [[April Fools' Day]] article appeared in a newspaper in [[Durand, Michigan]]. The false story consisted of safety concerns about the substance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.dictionary.com/e/tech-science/dihydrogen-monoxide/ |title={title} |access-date=2 May 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180502140130/http://www.dictionary.com/e/tech-science/dihydrogen-monoxide/ |archive-date=2 May 2018 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Wind Over Water: The Cape Wind Story''''' is an independent documentary film which chronicles the controversy over the [[Cape Wind]] Project. The film, by journalist Ole Tangen Jr. documented both sides of the debate as it unfolded on the Cape. An independent production, the filmmaker interviewed numerous people involved with the project including Jim Gordon of [[Cape Wind]] and Isaac Rosen, then director of the [[Alliance to Protect Nantucket Sound]].

Focusing also on wind power in general, ''Wind Over Water'' features aerial footage of the offshore wind farm at [[Horns Rev]] in Denmark and footage from various wind farms in the US.

The film had its world premiere on December 6, 2003, at Lillie Auditorium, Woods Hole, MA.  It has also been screened across the USA and in Canada and New Zealand.
