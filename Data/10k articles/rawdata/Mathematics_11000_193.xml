'''72''' ('''seventy-two''') is the [[natural number]] following [[71 (number)|71]] and preceding [[73 (number)|73]]. It is half a [[gross (unit)|gross]] or 6 [[dozen]] (i.e., 60 in [[duodecimal]]).

==In mathematics==
'''Seventy-two''' is the sum of four consecutive [[prime number|primes]] (13 + 17 + 19 + 23), as well as the sum of six consecutive primes (5 + 7 + 11 + 13 + 17 + 19). The product of 8 and 9, 72 is a [[pronic number]].

The sum of [[Euler's totient function]] φ(''x'') over the first fifteen integers is 72. There are 17 solutions to the equation φ(''x'') = 72, more than any integer below 72, making it a [[highly totient number]].

72 is the smallest number whose fifth power is the sum of five smaller fifth powers: 19&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; + 43&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; + 46&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; + 47&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; + 67&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; = 72&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;.

The sum of the eighth row of [[Lozanić's triangle]] is 72.

In a plane, the [[exterior angle]]s of a regular [[pentagon]] measure 72 degrees each.

In base 10, the number 72 is a [[Harshad number]].

The order in which this removal occurs makes no difference to the final stable state.&lt;ref name="clr"&gt;{{citation

When the threshold of active neighbors needed for an active cell to survive is high enough (depending on the lattice), the only stable states are states with no active cells, or states in which every cluster of active cells is infinitely large. For instance, on the [[square lattice]] with the [[von Neumann neighborhood]], there are finite clusters with at least two active neighbors per cluster cell, but when three or four active neighbors are required, any stable cluster must be infinite.&lt;ref name="clr"/&gt; With three active neighbors needed to stay active, an infinite cluster must stretch infinitely in three or four of the possible cardinal directions, and any finite holes it contains will necessarily be rectangular. In this case, the [[Percolation threshold|critical probability]] is&amp;nbsp;1, meaning that when the probability of each cell being active in the initial state is anything less than 1, then [[almost surely]] there is no infinite cluster.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

Bootstrap percolation can be interpreted as a [[cellular automaton]], resembling [[Conway's Game of Life]], in which live cells die when they have too few live neighbors. However, unlike Conway's Life, cells that have become dead never become alive again.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

One application of bootstrap percolation arises in the study of [[fault tolerance]] for [[distributed computing]]. If some processors in a large grid of processors fail (become inactive), then it may also be necessary to inactivate other processors with too few active neighbors, in order to preserve the high connectivity of the remaining network. The analysis of bootstrap percolation can be used to determine the failure probability that can be tolerated by the system.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

In [[mathematics]], a &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\operatorname{\textbf{CAT}}(k)}&lt;/math&gt; '''space''', where &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; is a real number, is a specific type of [[metric space]]. Intuitively, [[triangle]]s in a &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{CAT}(k)&lt;/math&gt; space are "slimmer" than corresponding "model triangles" in a standard space of [[constant curvature]] &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;. In a &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{CAT}(k)&lt;/math&gt; space, the curvature is bounded from above by &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;. A notable special case is &lt;math&gt;k=0&lt;/math&gt; [[complete space|complete]] &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{CAT}(0)&lt;/math&gt; spaces are known as '''[[Hadamard space]]s''' after the [[France|French]] [[mathematician]] [[Jacques Hadamard]].

Originally, [[Aleksandr Danilovich Aleksandrov|Aleksandrov]] called these spaces “&lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{R}_k&lt;/math&gt; domain”.
The terminology &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{CAT}(k)&lt;/math&gt; was coined by [[Mikhail Gromov (mathematician)|Mikhail Gromov]] in 1987 and is an [[acronym]] for [[Élie Cartan]], [[Aleksandr Danilovich Aleksandrov]] and [[Victor Andreevich Toponogov]] (although Toponogov never explored curvature bounded above in publications).

==Definitions==

[[Image:End of universe.jpg|thumb|Model triangles in spaces of positive (top), negative (middle) and zero (bottom) curvature.]]

For a [[real number]] &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;, let &lt;math&gt;M_k&lt;/math&gt; denote the unique [[simply connected space|simply connected]] [[Surface (mathematics)|surface]] (real 2-dimensional [[Riemannian manifold]]) with constant curvature &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;. Denote by &lt;math&gt;D_k&lt;/math&gt; the [[diameter]] of &lt;math&gt;M_k&lt;/math&gt;, which is &lt;math&gt;+\infty&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;k \leq 0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\frac{\pi}{\sqrt{k}}&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;k&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;.

Let &lt;math&gt;(X,d)&lt;/math&gt; be a [[geodesic metric space]], i.e. a metric space for which every two points &lt;math&gt;x,y\in X&lt;/math&gt; can be joined by a geodesic segment, an [[arc length]] parametrized [[curve|continuous curve]] &lt;math&gt;\gamma\,:\,[a,b] \to X,\ \gamma(a) = x,\ \gamma(b) = y&lt;/math&gt;, whose length

:&lt;math&gt;L(\gamma) = \sup \left\{ \left. \sum_{i = 1}^{r} d \big( \gamma(t_{i-1}), \gamma(t_{i}) \big) \right| a = t_{0} &lt; t_{1} &lt; \cdots &lt; t_{r} = b, r\in \mathbb{N} \right\}&lt;/math&gt;

is precisely &lt;math&gt;d(x,y)&lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt;\Delta&lt;/math&gt; be a triangle in &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; with geodesic segments as its sides. &lt;math&gt;\Delta&lt;/math&gt; is said to satisfy the &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\operatorname{\textbf{CAT}}(k)}&lt;/math&gt; '''inequality''' if there is a [[comparison triangle]] &lt;math&gt;\Delta'&lt;/math&gt; in the model space &lt;math&gt;M_k&lt;/math&gt;, with sides of the same length as the sides of &lt;math&gt;\Delta&lt;/math&gt;, such that distances between points on &lt;math&gt;\Delta&lt;/math&gt; are less than or equal to the distances between corresponding points on &lt;math&gt;\Delta'&lt;/math&gt;.

The geodesic metric space &lt;math&gt;(X,d)&lt;/math&gt; is said to be a &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\operatorname{\textbf{CAT}}(k)}&lt;/math&gt; '''space''' if every geodesic triangle &lt;math&gt;\Delta&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; with [[perimeter]] less than &lt;math&gt;2D_k&lt;/math&gt; satisfies the &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{CAT}(k)&lt;/math&gt; inequality. A (not-necessarily-geodesic) metric space &lt;math&gt;(X,\,d)&lt;/math&gt; is said to be a space with curvature &lt;math&gt;\leq k&lt;/math&gt; if every point of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; has a [[geodesic convexity|geodesically convex]] &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{CAT}(k)&lt;/math&gt; [[neighbourhood (mathematics)|neighbourhood]]. A space with curvature &lt;math&gt;\leq 0&lt;/math&gt; may be said to have [[non-positive curvature]].

==Examples==

* Any &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{CAT}(k)&lt;/math&gt; space &lt;math&gt;(X,d)&lt;/math&gt; is also a &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{CAT}(\ell)&lt;/math&gt; space for all &lt;math&gt;\ell&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;. In fact, the converse holds: if &lt;math&gt;(X,d)&lt;/math&gt; is a &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{CAT}(\ell)&lt;/math&gt; space for all &lt;math&gt;\ell&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;, then it is a &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{CAT}(k)&lt;/math&gt; space.
* &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-dimensional [[Euclidean space]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{E}^n&lt;/math&gt; with its usual metric is a &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{CAT}(0)&lt;/math&gt; space. More generally, any real [[inner product space]] (not necessarily complete) is a &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{CAT}(0)&lt;/math&gt; space; conversely, if a real [[normed vector space]] is a &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{CAT}(k)&lt;/math&gt; space for some real &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;, then it is an inner product space.
* &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-dimensional [[hyperbolic space]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{H}^n&lt;/math&gt; with its usual metric is a &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{CAT}(-1)&lt;/math&gt; space, and hence a &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{CAT}(0)&lt;/math&gt; space as well.
* The &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-dimensional [[unit sphere]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{S}^n&lt;/math&gt; is a &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{CAT}(1)&lt;/math&gt; space.
* More generally, the standard space &lt;math&gt;M_k&lt;/math&gt; is a &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{CAT}(k)&lt;/math&gt; space. So, for example, regardless of dimension, the sphere of radius &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; (and constant curvature &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{r^2}&lt;/math&gt;) is a &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{CAT}(\frac{1}{r^2})&lt;/math&gt; space. Note that the diameter of the sphere is &lt;math&gt;\pi r&lt;/math&gt; (as measured on the surface of the sphere) not &lt;math&gt;2r&lt;/math&gt; (as measured by going through the centre of the sphere).
* The [[punctured plane]] &lt;math&gt;\Pi = \mathbf{E}^2\backslash\{\mathbf{0}\}&lt;/math&gt; is not a &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{CAT}(0)&lt;/math&gt; space since it is not geodesically convex (for example, the points &lt;math&gt;(0,1)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(0,-1)&lt;/math&gt; cannot be joined by a geodesic in &lt;math&gt;\Pi&lt;/math&gt; with arc length 2), but every point of &lt;math&gt;\Pi&lt;/math&gt; does have a &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{CAT}(0)&lt;/math&gt; geodesically convex neighbourhood, so &lt;math&gt;\Pi&lt;/math&gt; is a space of curvature &lt;math&gt;\leq 0&lt;/math&gt;.
* The closed subspace &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{E}^3&lt;/math&gt; given by

::&lt;math&gt;X = \mathbf{E}^{3} \setminus \{ (x, y, z) | x &gt; 0, y &gt; 0 \text{ and } z &gt; 0 \}&lt;/math&gt;

:equipped with the induced length metric is ''not'' a &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{CAT}(k)&lt;/math&gt; space for any &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;.
* Any product of &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{CAT}(0)&lt;/math&gt; spaces is &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{CAT}(0)&lt;/math&gt;. (This does not hold for negative arguments.)

==Hadamard spaces==
{{main|Hadamard space}}

As a special case, a complete CAT(0) space is also known as a '''Hadamard space'''; this is by analogy with the situation for [[Hadamard manifold]]s. A Hadamard space is [[contractible space|contractible]] (it has the [[homotopy type]] of a single point) and, between any two points of a Hadamard space, there is a unique geodesic segment connecting them (in fact, both properties also hold for general, possibly incomplete, CAT(0) spaces). Most importantly, distance functions in Hadamard spaces are [[convex function|convex]]: if ''&amp;sigma;''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''&amp;sigma;''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are two geodesics in ''X'' defined on the same [[interval (mathematics)|interval]] of time ''I'', then the function ''I''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;'''R''' given by

:&lt;math&gt;t \mapsto d \big( \sigma_{1} (t), \sigma_{2} (t) \big)&lt;/math&gt;

is convex in ''t''.

==Properties of &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{CAT}(k)&lt;/math&gt; spaces==

Let &lt;math&gt;(X,d)&lt;/math&gt; be a &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{CAT}(k)&lt;/math&gt; space. Then the following properties hold:

* Given any two points &lt;math&gt;x,y\in X&lt;/math&gt; (with &lt;math&gt;d(x,y)&lt; D_k&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;k&gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;), there is a unique geodesic segment that joins &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;; moreover, this segment varies continuously as a function of its endpoints.
* Every local geodesic in &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; with length at most &lt;math&gt;D_k&lt;/math&gt; is a geodesic.
* The &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt;-[[open ball|balls]] in &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; of radius less than &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{2}D_k&lt;/math&gt; are (geodesically) convex.
* The &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt;-balls in &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; of radius less than &lt;math&gt;D_k&lt;/math&gt; are contractible.
* Approximate midpoints are close to midpoints in the following sense: for every &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;D_k&lt;/math&gt; and every &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; there exists a &lt;math&gt;\delta = \delta(k,\lambda,\epsilon)&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; such that, if &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; is the midpoint of a geodesic segment from &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;d(x,y)\leq \lambda&lt;/math&gt; and

::&lt;math&gt;\max \big\{ d(x, m'), d(y, m') \big\} \leq \frac1{2} d(x, y) + \delta,&lt;/math&gt;

: then &lt;math&gt;d(m,m') &lt; \epsilon&lt;/math&gt;.

* It follows from these properties that, for &lt;math&gt;k\leq 0&lt;/math&gt; the universal cover of every &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{CAT}(k)&lt;/math&gt; space is contractible; in particular, the higher [[homotopy group]]s of such a space are [[trivial group|trivial]].  As the example of the &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-sphere &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{S}^n&lt;/math&gt; shows, there is, in general, no hope for a &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{CAT}(k)&lt;/math&gt; space to be contractible if &lt;math&gt;k &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;.
* An &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-dimensional &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{CAT}(k)&lt;/math&gt; space equipped with the &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-dimensional Hausdorff measure satisfies the &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{CD}[n, (n-1)k]&lt;/math&gt; condition in the sense of Lott-Villani-Sturm {{Citation needed|date=December 2013}}.

It went [[Viral phenomenon|viral]] in a matter of days.&lt;ref name=cbc&gt;{{cite news|title=When is Cheryl's birthday?

==Origin==

The question was posted on [[Facebook]] by Singapore [[TV presenter]] Kenneth Kong.&lt;ref name=cbc/&gt; The posting drew thousands of comments, including several humorous ones—many aimed at Cheryl who apparently didn't want to disclose her birthday straight away. Kong posted it out of his debate with his wife, and he incorrectly thought it to be part of a mathematics question for a primary school examination, aimed at 10- to 11-year-old students,&lt;ref name=bellos&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bellos|first1=Alex|title=Can you solve the maths question for Singapore schoolkids that went viral?|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/alexs-adventures-in-numberland/2015/apr/13/can-you-solve-the-singapore-primary-maths-question-that-went-viral|accessdate=15 April 2015|work=The Guardian|date=13 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; although it was actually part of the 2015 Singapore and Asian Schools Math Olympiad (SASMO) meant for 14-year-old students, a fact later acknowledged by Kong.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Withnall|first1=Adam|title=Singapore maths question: How to solve the problem that has stumped the world|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/singapore-maths-problem-can-you-solve-the-viral-maths-question-that-was-set-to-children-in-singapore-10173090.html|accessdate=15 April 2015|work=The Independent|date=13 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The competition was held on 8 April 2015, with 28,000 participants from Singapore, Thailand, Vietnam, China and the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Carter|first1=Claire|last2=Gray|first2=Richard|last3=Harding|first3=Eleanor|title='When is Cheryl's birthday?'

SASMO's executive director told the [[BBC]] that "there was a place for some kind of logical and analytical thinking in the workplace and in our daily lives".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-32297367 BBC News, 14 April 2015]&lt;/ref&gt; 

==The question==
The question is number 24 in a list of 25 questions, and reads as follows:&lt;ref name=bellos/&gt;

"Albert and Bernard just become{{sic}}&lt;!-- 'sic' means that the original question has a grammatical error. Please do not remove it. --&gt; friends with Cheryl, and they want to know when her birthday is. Cheryl gives them a list of 10 possible dates:
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! May
|
| 15
| 16
| 
| 
| 19
|-
! June
| 
| 
| 
| 17
| 18
| 
|-
! July
| 14
| 
| 16
| 
| 
| 
|-
! August
| 14
| 15
| 
| 17
| 
| 
|}

Cheryl then tells Albert and Bernard separately the month and the day of her birthday respectively.

Albert: I don't know when Cheryl's birthday is, but I know that Bernard doesn't know too.{{sic}}&lt;!-- 'sic' means that the original question has a grammatical error. Please do not remove it. --&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Bernard: At first I don't{{sic}}&lt;!-- 'sic' means that the original question has a grammatical error. Please do not remove it. --&gt; know when Cheryl's birthday is, but I know now.&lt;br&gt;
Albert: Then I also know when Cheryl's birthday is.&lt;br&gt;
So when is Cheryl's birthday?"

==Solution==
The answer to the question is July 16.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dua|first1=Ruchi|title=Cheryl's birthday: Singapore school maths problem stumps the Internet l|url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/cheryl-birthday-singapore-maths-problem-internet-twitter-facebook/1/430186.html|accessdate=15 April 2015|work=India Today|date=15 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The answer can be deduced by progressively eliminating impossible dates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Chang|first1=Kenneth|title=How to Figure Out Cheryl's Birthday|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/15/science/answer-to-the-singapore-math-problem-cheryl-birthday.html|accessdate=15 April 2015|work=The New York Times|date=14 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is how Alex Bellos in the UK newspaper ''[[The Guardian]]'' presented its outcome:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bellos|first1=Alex|title=How to solve Albert, Bernard and Cheryl's birthday maths problem|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/alexs-adventures-in-numberland/2015/apr/13/how-to-solve-albert-bernard-and-cheryls-birthday-maths-problem|accessdate=15 April 2015|work=The Guardian|date=13 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|''Albert: I don’t know when Cheryl’s birthday is, but I know that Bernard doesn’t know too.''

All Albert knows is the month, and every month has more than one possible date, so of course he doesn’t know when her birthday is. The first part of the sentence is redundant.

The only way that Bernard could know the date with a single number, however, would be if Cheryl had told him 18 or 19, since of the ten date options these are the only numbers that appear just once, as May 19 and June 18.

For Albert to know that Bernard does not know, Albert must therefore have been told July or August, since this rules out Bernard being told 18 or 19.

''Line 2) Bernard: At first I don’t know when Cheryl’s birthday is, but now I know.''

Bernard has deduced that Albert has either August or July. If he knows the full date, he must have been told 15, 16 or 17, since if he had been told 14 he would be none the wiser about whether the month was August or July. Each of 15, 16 and 17 only refers to one specific month, but 14 could be either month.

''Line 3) Albert: Then I also know when Cheryl’s birthday is.''

Albert has therefore deduced that the possible dates are July 16, Aug 15 and Aug 17. For him to know now, he must have been told July. If he had been told August, he would not know which date for certain is the birthday.

Therefore, the answer is July 16.}}

===Incorrect solution===
After the question went viral, some people suggested August 17 was an alternative answer to the question.&lt;ref name=why /&gt; This is rejected by the Singapore and Asian School Math Olympiads as a valid answer.&lt;ref name=why&gt;{{cite news|last1=Grime|first1=James|title=Why the Cheryl birthday problem turned into the maths version of #TheDress|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/alexs-adventures-in-numberland/2015/apr/15/why-the-cheryl-birthday-problem-turned-into-the-maths-version-of-thatdress|accessdate=15 April 2015|work=The Guardian|date=15 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The solutions which arrive at this answer ignore that the latter part of:
:''Albert: I don't know when Cheryl's birthday is, but I know that Bernard doesn't know too.''
conveys information to Bernard about how Albert was able to deduce this.  Bernard would only have known the birthday if the date was unique, 18 or 19.  Albert therefore is able to deduce that "Bernard doesn't know" because he heard a month that does not contain those dates (July or August).  Realizing this, Bernard can rule out May and June, which allows him to arrive at a unique birthday even if he is given the dates 15 or 16, not just 17.

As the SASMO organizers have pointed out,&lt;ref name=sasmofb&gt;Henry Ong, Executive Director, Singapore and Asian School Math Olympiads, [https://www.facebook.com/4sasmo/posts/983812798320363 SASMO's Reply to Queries Why Cheryl's birthday is not Aug 17]&lt;/ref&gt; August 17 would be the solution if the sequence of statements instead began with Bernard saying that he did not know Cheryl's birthday:

{{quote|
Bernard: I don't know when Cheryl's birthday is.&lt;br/&gt;
Albert: I still don't know when Cheryl's birthday is.&lt;br/&gt;
Bernard: At first I didn't know when Cheryl's birthday is, but I know now.&lt;br/&gt;
Albert: Then I also know when Cheryl's birthday is.}}

It would also be the answer if the first statement was made by Cheryl instead:
{{quote|
Cheryl: Bernard doesn't know when my birthday is.&lt;br/&gt;
Albert: I still don't know when Cheryl's birthday is.&lt;br/&gt;
Bernard: At first I didn't know when Cheryl's birthday is, but I know now.&lt;br/&gt;
Albert: Then I also know when Cheryl's birthday is.}}

Note: The final statements by Albert in the two alternative examples only completes a dialogue, they are not needed by the reader to determine Cheryl's birthday as August 17.

==Sequel==
On May 14, 2015, [[Nanyang Technological University]] uploaded a second part to the question on Facebook, this time titled "Cheryl's Age". It reads as follows:

Albert and Bernard now want to know how old Cheryl is.&lt;br&gt;
Cheryl: I have two younger brothers. The product of all our ages (i.e. my age and the ages of my two brothers) is 144, assuming that we use whole numbers for our ages. &lt;br&gt;
Albert: We still don't know your age. What other hints can you give us? &lt;br&gt;
Cheryl: The sum of all our ages is the bus number of this bus that we are on. &lt;br&gt;
Bernard: Of course we know the bus number, but we still don't know your age. &lt;br&gt;
Cheryl: Oh, I forgot to tell you that my brothers have the same age. &lt;br&gt;
Albert and Bernard: Oh, now we know your age.

So what is Cheryl's age?&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1 = Lee|first1 = Min Kok|title = 'Cheryl's birthday' poser is back with Part 2: Cheryl's age|url = http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/cheryls-birthday-poser-is-back-with-part-2-cheryls-age|accessdate = 29 December 2015|date = 15 May 2015|work = The Straits Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sequel solution===&lt;!--Although the word 'sequel' is redundant considering its parent section, it is there to provide a separate anchor if the pages is linked to, as otherwise linking the page to section 'sequel' would link the first, but not the second section.--&gt;

Cheryl first says that she is the oldest of three siblings, and that their ages multiplied makes 144. 144 can be decomposed into prime number factors by the [[fundamental theorem of arithmetic]] (144 = 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 3 x 3), and all possible ages for Cheryl and her two brothers examined (for example, 16, 9, 1, or 8, 6, 3, and so on). The sums of the ages can then be computed. Because Bernard (who knows the bus number) cannot determine Cheryl's age despite having been told this sum, it must be a sum that is not unique among the possible solutions. On examining all the possible ages, it turns out there are two pairs of sets of possible ages that produce the same sum as each other: 9, 4, 4 and 8, 6, 3, which sum to 17, and 12, 4, 3 and 9, 8, 2, which sum to 19. Cheryl then says that her brothers are the same age, which eliminates the last three possibilities and leaves only 9, 4, 4, so we can deduce that Cheryl is 9 years old and her brothers are 4 years old, and the bus the three of them are on has the number 17.

In [[computational geometry]], the '''convex layers''' of a set of points in the [[Euclidean plane]] are a sequence of nested [[convex polygon]]s having the points as their vertices. The outermost one is the [[convex hull]] of the points and the rest are formed in the same way [[recursion|recursively]]. The innermost layer may be degenerate, consisting only of one or two points.&lt;ref name="c85"&gt;{{citation

The problem of constructing convex layers has also been called '''onion peeling''' or '''onion decomposition'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

Although constructing the convex layers by repeatedly finding convex hulls would be slower, it is possible to partition any set of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; points into its convex layers in time &lt;math&gt;O(n\log n)&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="c85"/&gt;

Convex layers may be used as part of an efficient [[range reporting]] data structure for listing all of the points in a query [[half-plane]]. The points in the half-plane from each successive layer may be found by a binary search to find the most extreme point in the direction of the half-plane, and then searching sequentially from there. [[Fractional cascading]] can be used to speed up the binary searches, giving total query time &lt;math&gt;O(\log n+k)&lt;/math&gt; to find &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; points out of a set of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

'''Cooperative Coevolution''' (CC) is an [[evolutionary computation]] method that divides a large [[problem]] into subcomponents and solves them independently in order to solve the large problem.&lt;ref&gt;M. A. Potter and K. A. D. Jong, “A cooperative coevolutionary approach to function optimization,” in PPSN III: Proceedings of the International Conference on Evolutionary Computation. The Third Conference on Parallel Problem Solving from Nature. London, UK:Springer-Verlag, 1994, pp. 249–257.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The subcomponents are also called [[species]]. The subcomponents are implemented as subpopulations and the only interaction between subpopulations is in the cooperative evaluation of each individual of the subpopulations. The general CC framework is nature inspired where the individuals of a particular group of species mate amongst themselves, however, [[mating]] in between different species is not feasible. The cooperative evaluation of each individual in a subpopulation is done by [[concatenating]] the current individual with the best individuals from the rest of the subpopulations as described by M. Potter.&lt;ref name="Mitchell A. Potter 2000, p.1-29"&gt;Mitchell A. Potter, Kenneth A. De Jong, Cooperative Coevolution: An Architecture for Evolving Coadapted Subcomponents, Evolutionary Computation, v.8 n.1, 2000, p.1-29.&lt;/ref&gt;

The cooperative [[coevolution]] framework has been applied to real world problems such as [[pedestrian]] detection systems,&lt;ref&gt;Cao, X., Qiao, H. and Keane, J., A low-cost pedestrian-detection system with a single optical camera. IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems. v9 i1. 58-67.

Sci. 178, 15 (Aug. 2008), 2985-2999&lt;/ref&gt; and [[neural network]] training.&lt;ref name="Mitchell A. Potter 2000, p.1-29"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;García-Pedrajas, N., Hervás-Martínez, C. and Muñoz Pérez, J., COVNET: a cooperative coevolutionary model for evolving artificial neural networks. IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks. v14 i3. 575-596.
&lt;/ref&gt;
It has also be further extended into another method, called [[Constructive cooperative coevolution]].

In topology, a branch of mathematics, a '''cosheaf''' with values in an [[∞-category]] ''C'' that admits colimits is a functor ''F'' from the category of open subsets of a topological space ''X'' (more precisely its [[nerve (category theory)|nerve]]) to ''C'' such that
*(1) The ''F'' of the empty set is the initial object.
*(2) For any increasing sequence &lt;math&gt;U_i&lt;/math&gt; of open subsets with union ''U'', the canonical map &lt;math&gt;\varinjlim F(U_i) \to F(U)&lt;/math&gt; is an equivalence.
*(3) &lt;math&gt;F(U \cup V)&lt;/math&gt; is the pushout of &lt;math&gt;F(U \cap V) \to F(U)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;F(U \cap V) \to F(V)&lt;/math&gt;.

The basic example is &lt;math&gt;U \mapsto C_*(U; A)&lt;/math&gt; where on the right is the [[singular chain complex]] of ''U'' with coefficients in an abelian group ''A''.

{{Network_Science}}

A [[scale-free network]] is a type of networks that is of particular interest of [[network science]]. It is characterized by its degree distribution following a power law. While the most widely known generative models for scale-free networks are [[stochastic]], such as the [[Barabási–Albert model]] or the [[Fitness model (network theory)|Fitness model]] can reproduce many properties of real-life networks by assuming [[preferential attachment]] and incremental growth, the understanding of '''deterministic scale-free networks''' leads to valuable, analytical results.

==Concept==
Although there are multiple deterministic models to generate scale-free networks, it is common, that they define a simple algorithm of adding nodes, which is then iteratively repeated and thus leads to a complex network. As these models are deterministic, it is possible to get analytic results about the [[degree distribution]], [[clustering coefficient]], average shortest path length, random walk centrality and other relevant network metrics.

Deterministic models are especially useful to explain empirically observed phenomena and demonstrate the existence of networks with certain properties. For example, the Barabási-Albert model predicts a decreasing average clustering coefficient as the number of nodes increases,&lt;ref&gt;Zadorozhnyi, V.; Yudin, E. Structural properties of the scale-free Barabasi-Albert graph, Automation &amp; Remote Control. Apr 2012, Vol. 73 Issue 4, p702-716.&lt;/ref&gt; whereas empirical evidence suggests otherwise. [[Hierarchical network model]]s can explain this phenomenon while also retaining the scale-free property.&lt;ref&gt;Komjathy, J
Simon, K. Generating hierarchical scale-free graphs from fractals, Chaos, Solitons &amp; Fractals; Aug, 2011, 44 8, p651-p666&lt;/ref&gt; Another notable example is that it is possible to generate networks deterministically, which are scale-free and linear world at the same time, showing that [[Small-world network|small-world property]] is not a necessary consequence of the scale-free property.&lt;ref name="linear"&gt;Zhu, L-Z., Yin, B-B., Zhao, L., Cai, K-Y. Scale-free networks can be linear-world, International Journal of Modern Physics B: Condensed Matter Physics; Statistical Physics; Applied Physics. 12/30/2011, Vol. 25 Issue 32, p4593-4603&lt;/ref&gt;

==Properties==
The exact properties of the generated networks depend on the particular algorithm with which they are constructed, therefore there are not many common properties. The single unifying property is scale-freeness, that is, the degree distribution of the nodes always follows a power law at least asymptotically, which means that a randomly selected node has k edges with probability

&lt;math&gt;P(k) = ck^{-\lambda}&lt;/math&gt;

where the degree coefficient (&amp;lambda;) depends on the model parameters.

Also, because of the iterative construction, many of the models produce hierarchical networks with fractal-like properties. Other properties, such as network diameter, average path length, clustering coefficient vary across models depending on the construction.

==Examples==

===Barabási-Ravasz-Vicsek model===
One of the first deterministic scale-free network models was proposed by Barabási, Ravasz and Vicsek. It involved the generation of a hierarchical, scale-free network by following a set of simple steps:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Step 0: We start from a single node, that we designate as the root of the graph.

Step 1: We add two more nodes, and connect each of them to the root.

Step 2: We add two units of three nodes, each unit identical to the network created in the previous iteration (step 1), and we connect each of the bottom nodes [...] of these two units to the root. That is, the root will gain four more new links.

Step 3: We add two units of nine nodes each, identical to the units generated in the previous iteration, and connect all eight bottom nodes of the two new units to the root.

[...]

Step n: Add two units of 3n−1 nodes each, identical to the network created in the previous iteration (step n−1), and connect each of the 2n bottom nodes of these two units to the root of the network.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barabasi, A-L., Ravasz, E., Vicsek, T. Deterministic Scale-Free Networks, Physica A 299, (3-4) (2001), pp. 559-564&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been analytically shown, that the degree distribution of this network asymptotically follows a power law with a degree exponent of ln(3)/ln(2). Iguchi and Yamada has shown that most of the important network statistics can be derived analytically in this model.&lt;ref&gt;[https://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0405662 Igucshi, K., Yamada, H. working paper]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lu-Su-Guo model===
This model based on a binary tree exhibits both the scale-free property and the ultra small-world property (the average shorthest path increases more slowly than the logarithm of the number of nodes) for an arbitrary number of nodes.&lt;ref&gt;Lu, Z., Su, Y-X., Guo, S-Z. Deterministic scale-free small-world networks of arbitrary order, In Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications 1 September 2013 392(17):3555-3562&lt;/ref&gt;

===Zhu-Yin-Zhao-Chai model===
The authors propose two models which exhibit the power law in the degree distribution while the average shortest path grows linearly with the number of nodes. This proves that not every scale-free network has the small-world property. One of their models shows that this can also be true in the absence of degree correlation.&lt;ref name="linear"/&gt;

{{Calculus |Differential}}

The term '''differential''' is used in [[calculus]] to refer to an [[infinitesimal]] (infinitely small) change in some [[Variable (mathematics)|varying quantity]]. For example, if ''x'' is a [[Variable (mathematics)|variable]], then a change in the value of ''x'' is often denoted Δ''x'' (pronounced ''[[Delta (Greek)|delta]] x''). The differential ''dx'' represents an infinitely small change in the variable ''x''. The idea of an infinitely small or infinitely slow change is extremely useful intuitively, and there are a number of ways to make the notion mathematically precise.

Using calculus, it is possible to relate the infinitely small changes of various variables to each other mathematically using [[derivative]]s. If ''y'' is a function of ''x'', then the differential ''dy'' of ''y'' is related to ''dx'' by the formula
:&lt;math&gt;dy = \frac{dy}{dx} \,dx,&lt;/math&gt;
where ''dy''/''dx'' denotes the [[derivative]] of ''y'' with respect to ''x''. This formula summarizes the intuitive idea that the derivative of ''y'' with respect to ''x'' is the limit of the ratio of differences Δ''y''/Δ''x'' as Δ''x'' becomes infinitesimal.

There are several approaches for making the notion of differentials mathematically precise.
# Differentials as [[linear map]]s. This approach underlies the definition of the [[total derivative|derivative]] and the [[exterior derivative]] in [[differential geometry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Darling|1994}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
# Differentials as [[nilpotent]] elements of [[commutative ring]]s. This approach is popular in algebraic geometry.&lt;ref name="Harris1998"&gt;{{Harvnb|Eisenbud|Harris|1998}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
# Differentials in smooth models of set theory. This approach is known as [[synthetic differential geometry]] or [[smooth infinitesimal analysis]] and is closely related to the algebraic geometric approach, except that ideas from [[topos theory]] are used to ''hide'' the mechanisms by which nilpotent infinitesimals are introduced.&lt;ref&gt;See {{Harvnb|Kock|2006}} and {{Harvnb|Moerdijk|Reyes|1991}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
# Differentials as infinitesimals in [[hyperreal number]] systems, which are extensions of the real numbers that contain invertible infinitesimals and infinitely large numbers. This is the approach of [[nonstandard analysis]] pioneered by [[Abraham Robinson]].&lt;ref name="nonstd"&gt;See {{Harvnb|Robinson|1996}} and {{Harvnb|Keisler|1986}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

These approaches are very different from each other, but they have in common the idea to be ''quantitative'', i.e., to say not just that a differential is infinitely small, but ''how'' small it is.

== History and usage ==
{{See also|History of calculus}}

[[Infinitesimal]] quantities played a significant role in the development of calculus. [[Archimedes]] used them, even though he didn't believe that arguments involving infinitesimals were rigorous.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Boyer|1991}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Isaac Newton]] referred to them as [[Method of Fluxions|fluxions]]. However, it was [[Gottfried Leibniz]] who coined the term ''differentials'' for infinitesimal quantities and introduced the notation for them which is still used today.

In [[Leibniz's notation]], if ''x'' is a variable quantity, then ''dx'' denotes an infinitesimal change in the variable ''x''. Thus, if ''y'' is a function of ''x'', then the [[derivative]] of ''y'' with respect to ''x'' is often denoted ''dy''/''dx'', which would otherwise be denoted (in the notation of Newton or [[Joseph-Louis Lagrange|Lagrange]]) ''ẏ'' or ''y''{{′}}. The use of differentials in this form attracted much criticism, for instance in the famous pamphlet [[The Analyst]] by Bishop Berkeley. Nevertheless, the notation has remained popular because it suggests strongly the idea that the derivative of ''y'' at ''x'' is its [[instantaneous rate of change]] (the [[slope (mathematics)|slope]] of the graph's [[tangent line]]), which may be obtained by taking the [[limit (mathematics)|limit]] of the ratio Δ''y''/Δ''x'' of the change in ''y'' over the change in ''x'', as the change in ''x'' becomes arbitrarily small. Differentials are also compatible with [[dimensional analysis]], where a differential such as ''dx'' has the same dimensions as the variable ''x''.

Differentials are also used in the notation for [[integral]]s because an integral can be regarded as an infinite sum of infinitesimal quantities: the area under a graph is obtained by subdividing the graph into infinitely thin strips and summing their areas. In an expression such as
:&lt;math&gt;\int f(x) \,dx,&lt;/math&gt;
the integral sign (which is a modified [[long s]]) denotes the infinite sum, ''f''(''x'') denotes the "height" of a thin strip, and the differential ''dx'' denotes its infinitely thin width.

== Differentials as linear maps ==

There is a simple way to make precise sense of differentials by regarding them as [[linear map]]s. To illustrate, suppose ''f''(''x'') is a real-valued function on '''R'''.  We can reinterpret the variable ''x'' in ''f''(''x'') as being a function rather than a number, namely the [[identity map]] on the real line, which takes a real number ''p'' to itself: ''x''(''p'')&amp;nbsp;= ''p''.  Then ''f''(''x'') is the composite of ''f'' with ''x'', whose value at ''p'' is ''f''(''x''(''p''))&amp;nbsp;= ''f''(''p''). The differential ''df'' (which of course depends on ''f'') is then a function whose value at ''p'' (usually denoted ''df''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;) is not a number, but a linear map from '''R''' to '''R'''. Since a linear map from '''R''' to '''R''' is given by a 1&amp;times;1 [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrix]], it is essentially the same thing as a number, but the change in the point of view allows us to think of ''df''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt; as an infinitesimal and ''compare'' it with the ''standard infinitesimal'' ''dx''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;, which is again just the identity map from '''R''' to '''R''' (a 1&amp;times;1 [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] with entry 1). The identity map has the property that if ε is very small, then ''dx''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;(ε) is very small, which enables us to regard it as infinitesimal. The differential ''df''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt; has the same property, because it is just a multiple of ''dx''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;, and this multiple is the derivative ''f''&amp;thinsp;&amp;prime;(''p'') by definition. We therefore obtain that ''df''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;= ''f''&amp;thinsp;&amp;prime;(''p'')&amp;thinsp;''dx''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;, and hence ''df''&amp;nbsp;= ''f''&amp;thinsp;&amp;prime;&amp;thinsp;''dx''. Thus we recover the idea that ''f''&amp;thinsp;&amp;prime; is the ratio of the differentials ''df'' and ''dx''.

This would just be a trick were it not for the fact that:
# it captures the idea of the derivative of ''f'' at ''p'' as the ''best linear approximation'' to ''f'' at ''p'';
# it has many generalizations.

For instance, if ''f'' is a function from '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; to '''R''', then we say that ''f'' is ''differentiable''&lt;ref&gt;See, for instance, {{Harvnb|Apostol|1967}}.&lt;/ref&gt; at ''p''&amp;nbsp;∈ '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; if there is a linear map ''df''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt; from '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; to '''R''' such that for any ε&amp;nbsp;&gt; 0, there is a [[neighbourhood (mathematics)|neighbourhood]] ''N'' of ''p'' such that for ''x''&amp;nbsp;∈ ''N'',
:&lt;math&gt;\left|f(x) - f(p) - df_p(x-p)\right| &lt; \varepsilon\left|x-p\right| .&lt;/math&gt;

We can now use the same trick as in the one-dimensional case and think of the expression ''f''(''x''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;, ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, …, ''x''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;) as the composite of ''f'' with the standard coordinates ''x''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;, ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, …, ''x''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; on '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; (so that ''x''&lt;sup&gt;''j''&lt;/sup&gt;(''p'') is the ''j''-th component of ''p''&amp;nbsp;∈ '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;). Then the differentials (''dx''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;, (''dx''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;, (''dx''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt; at a point ''p'' form a [[basis (linear algebra)|basis]] for the [[vector space]] of linear maps from '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; to '''R''' and therefore, if ''f'' is differentiable at ''p'', we can write ''df''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt; as a [[linear combination]] of these basis elements:
:&lt;math&gt;df_p = \sum_{j=1}^n D_j f(p) \,(dx^j)_p.&lt;/math&gt;

The coefficients ''D''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;''f''(''p'') are (by definition) the [[partial derivative]]s of ''f'' at ''p'' with respect to ''x''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;, ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, …, ''x''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;. Hence, if ''f'' is differentiable on all of '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;, we can write, more concisely:
:&lt;math&gt;df = \frac{\partial f}{\partial x^1} \,dx^1 + \frac{\partial f}{\partial x^2} \,dx^2 + \cdots +\frac{\partial f}{\partial x^n} \,dx^n.&lt;/math&gt;

In the one-dimensional case this becomes
:&lt;math&gt;df = \frac{df}{dx}dx&lt;/math&gt;
as before.

This idea generalizes straightforwardly to functions from '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; to '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt;. Furthermore, it has the decisive advantage over other definitions of the derivative that it is [[invariant (mathematics)|invariant]] under changes of coordinates. This means that the same idea can be used to define the [[pushforward (differential)|differential]] of [[smooth map]]s between [[smooth manifold]]s.

Aside: Note that the existence of all the [[partial derivative]]s of ''f''(''x'') at ''x'' is a [[necessary condition]] for the existence of a differential at ''x''. However it is not a [[sufficient condition]]. For counterexamples, see [[Gâteaux derivative]].

== Algebraic geometry ==

In [[algebraic geometry]], differentials and other infinitesimal notions are handled in a very explicit way by accepting that the [[coordinate ring]] or [[structure sheaf]] of a space may contain [[nilpotent element]]s. The simplest example is the ring of [[dual number]]s '''R'''[''ε''], where ''ε''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.

This can be motivated by the algebro-geometric point of view on the derivative of a function ''f'' from '''R''' to '''R''' at a point ''p''. For this, note first that ''f''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus; ''f''(''p'') belongs to the [[ideal (ring theory)|ideal]] ''I''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt; of functions on '''R''' which vanish at ''p''. If the derivative ''f'' vanishes at ''p'', then ''f''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus; ''f''(''p'') belongs to the square ''I''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; of this ideal. Hence the derivative of ''f'' at ''p'' may be captured by the equivalence class [''f''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus; ''f''(''p'')] in the [[quotient space (linear algebra)|quotient space]]  ''I''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;/''I''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, and the [[jet (mathematics)|1-jet]] of ''f'' (which encodes its value and its first derivative) is the equivalence class of ''f'' in the space of all functions modulo ''I''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Algebraic geometers regard this equivalence class as the ''restriction'' of ''f'' to a ''thickened'' version of the point ''p'' whose coordinate ring is not '''R''' (which is the quotient space of functions on '''R''' modulo ''I''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;) but '''R'''[''ε''] which is the quotient space of functions on '''R''' modulo ''I''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Such a thickened point is a simple example of a [[Scheme (mathematics)|scheme]].&lt;ref name="Harris1998" /&gt;

== Synthetic differential geometry ==

A third approach to infinitesimals is the method of [[synthetic differential geometry]]&lt;ref&gt;See {{Harvnb|Kock|2006}} and {{Harvnb|Lawvere|1968}}.&lt;/ref&gt; or [[smooth infinitesimal analysis]].&lt;ref&gt;See {{Harvnb|Moerdijk|Reyes|1991}} and {{Harvnb|Bell|1998}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This is closely related to the algebraic-geometric approach, except that the infinitesimals are more implicit and intuitive. The main idea of this approach is to replace the [[category of sets]] with another [[category (mathematics)|category]] of ''smoothly varying sets'' which is a [[topos]]. In this category, one can define the real numbers, smooth functions, and so on, but the real numbers ''automatically'' contain nilpotent infinitesimals, so these do not need to be introduced by hand as in the algebraic geometric approach. However the [[logic]] in this new category is not identical to the familiar logic of the category of sets: in particular, the [[law of the excluded middle]] does not hold. This means that set-theoretic mathematical arguments only extend to smooth infinitesimal analysis if they are ''[[constructive mathematics|constructive]]'' (e.g., do not use [[proof by contradiction]]). Some{{who|date=November 2012}} regard this disadvantage as a positive thing, since it forces one to find constructive arguments wherever they are available.

== Nonstandard analysis ==

The final approach to infinitesimals again involves extending the real numbers, but in a less drastic way. In the [[nonstandard analysis]] approach there are no nilpotent infinitesimals, only invertible ones, which may be viewed as the [[multiplicative inverse|reciprocal]]s of infinitely large numbers.&lt;ref name="nonstd"/&gt; Such extensions of the real numbers may be constructed explicitly using equivalence classes of sequences of [[real number]]s, so that, for example, the sequence (1,&amp;nbsp;1/2,&amp;nbsp;1/3,&amp;nbsp;…,&amp;nbsp;1/''n'',&amp;nbsp;…) represents an infinitesimal. The [[first-order logic]] of this new set of [[hyperreal number]]s is the same as the logic for the usual real numbers, but the [[completeness axiom]] (which involves [[second-order logic]]) does not hold. Nevertheless, this suffices to develop an elementary and quite intuitive approach to calculus using infinitesimals, see [[transfer principle]].

In [[additive number theory]], an area of [[mathematics]], the '''Erdős–Tetali theorem''' is an [[existence theorem]] concerning economical [[additive basis]] of every order. More specifically, it states that for every fixed integer &lt;math&gt;h \geq 2&lt;/math&gt;, there exists a subset of the natural numbers &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{B} \subseteq \mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt; satisfying&lt;math display="block"&gt;r_{\mathcal{B},h}(n) = \Theta(\log(n)),&lt;/math&gt;where &lt;math&gt;r_{\mathcal{B},h}(n)&lt;/math&gt; denotes the number of ways that a natural number ''n'' can be expressed as the sum of ''h'' elements of ''B.''

The theorem is named after [[Paul Erdős]] and [[Prasad V. Tetali]], who published it in 1990.

== Motivation ==
The original motivation for this result is attributed to a problem posed by S. Sidon in 1932 on ''economical bases''. An additive basis &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{B}\subseteq\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt; is called ''economical''&lt;ref&gt;As in Halberstam &amp; Roth (1983), p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt; (or sometimes ''thin''&lt;ref&gt;As in Tao &amp; Vu (2006), p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;) when it is an additive basis of order ''h'' and&lt;math display="block"&gt;r_{\mathcal{B},h}(n) \ll_{\varepsilon} n^\varepsilon,&lt;/math&gt;that is, &lt;math&gt;r_{\mathcal{B},h}(n) \ll n^\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt; for every &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;. In other words, these are additive bases that use as few numbers as possible to represent a given ''n'', and yet represent every natural number. Related concepts include [[Sidon sequence|&lt;math&gt;B_h[g]&lt;/math&gt;-sequences]]&lt;ref&gt;See Definition 3 (p. 3) of O'Bryant, K. (2004), [http://www.emis.ams.org/journals/EJC/Surveys/ds11.pdf "A complete annotated bibliography of work related to Sidon sequences"] (PDF), ''Electronic Journal of Combinatorics'', '''11''': 39.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Erdős–Turán conjecture on additive bases]].

Sidon's question was whether an economical basis of order 2 exists. A positive answer was given by P. Erdős in 1956,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Erdős|first=P.|date=1956|title=Problems and results in additive number theory|url=|journal=Colloque sur le Theorie des Nombres|volume=|pages=127–137|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; settling the yet-to-be-called Erdős–Tetali theorem for the case &lt;math&gt;h=2&lt;/math&gt;. Although the general version was believed to be true, no complete proof appeared in the literature before the paper from Erdős &amp; Tetali (1990).&lt;ref&gt;p. 264 of Erdős &amp; Tetali (1990).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ideas in the proof ==
The proof is an instance of the [[probabilistic method]], and can be divided into three main steps. First, one start by defining a ''random sequence'' &lt;math&gt;\omega \subseteq \mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt; by&lt;math display="block"&gt;\Pr(n\in \omega) = \mathbf{c}\cdot n^{\frac{1}{h} - 1} \log(n)^{\frac{1}{h}},&lt;/math&gt;where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{c}&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; is some large real constant, &lt;math&gt;h\geq 2&lt;/math&gt; is a fixed integer and ''n'' is sufficiently large so that the above formula is well-defined. A detailed discussion on the probability space associated with this type of construction may be found on Halberstam &amp; Roth (1983).&lt;ref&gt;See Theorem 1 of Chapter III.&lt;/ref&gt;

Secondly, one then shows that the [[expected value]] of the [[random variable]] &lt;math&gt;r_{\omega,h}(n)&lt;/math&gt; has the order of [[Logarithmic function|log]]. That is,&lt;math display="block"&gt;\mathbb{E}(r_{\omega,h}(n)) = \Theta(\log(n)).&lt;/math&gt;Finally, one shows that &lt;math&gt;r_{\omega,h}(n)&lt;/math&gt; [[almost surely]] concentrates around its mean. More explicitly:&lt;math display="block"&gt;\Pr\big(\exists c_1,c_2&gt;0 : \forall\text{suff. large } n\in\mathbb{N} ,~ c_1\mathbb{E}(r_{\omega,h}(n)) \leq r_{\omega,h}(n) \leq c_2\mathbb{E}(r_{\omega,h}(n))\big) = 1&lt;/math&gt;This is the critical step of the proof. Originally it was dealt with by means of [[Janson's inequality]], a type of [[concentration inequality]] for multivariate polynomials. Tao &amp; Vu (2006)&lt;ref&gt;Section 1.8 of Tao &amp; Vu (2006).&lt;/ref&gt; present this proof with a more sophisticated two-sided concentration inequality by V. Vu (2000),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vu|first=Van H.|date=2000-07-01|title=On the concentration of multivariate polynomials with small expectation|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/1098-2418(200007)16:43.0.CO;2-5/abstract|journal=Random Structures &amp; Algorithms|language=en|volume=16|issue=4|pages=344–363|doi=10.1002/1098-2418(200007)16:4%3C344::aid-rsa4%3E3.0.co;2-5|issn=1098-2418}}&lt;/ref&gt; thus relatively simplifying this step. Alon &amp; Spencer (2016) classify this proof as an instance of the [[Poisson paradigm]].&lt;ref&gt;Chapter 8, p. 139 of Alon &amp; Spencer (2016).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Computable economical bases ===
All the known proofs of Erdős–Tetali theorem are, by the nature of the infinite probability space used, [[Non-constructive|non-constructive proofs]]. However, Kolountzakis (1995)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kolountzakis|first=Mihail N.|date=1995-10-13|title=An effective additive basis for the integers|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0012365X9400044J|journal=Discrete Mathematics|volume=145|issue=1|pages=307–313|doi=10.1016/0012-365X(94)00044-J}}&lt;/ref&gt; showed the existence of a [[recursive set]] &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{R}\subseteq \mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt; satisfying &lt;math&gt;r_{\mathcal{R},2}(n)=\Theta(\log(n))&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{R}\cap\{0,1,\ldots ,n\}&lt;/math&gt; takes polynomial time in ''n'' to be computed. The question for &lt;math&gt;h\geq 3&lt;/math&gt; remains open.

=== Economical subbases ===
Given an arbitrary additive basis &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}\subseteq\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt;, one can ask whether there exists &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{B}\subseteq\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{B}&lt;/math&gt; is an economical basis. V. Vu (2000)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vu|first=Van H.|date=2000-10-15|title=On a refinement of Waring's problem|url=http://projecteuclid.org/euclid.dmj/1092403818|journal=Duke Mathematical Journal|volume=105|issue=1|pages=107–134|doi=10.1215/s0012-7094-00-10516-9|issn=0012-7094}}&lt;/ref&gt; showed that this is the case for [[Waring's problem|Waring bases]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{N}^{\wedge} k := \{0^k, 1^k, 2^k,\ldots \}&lt;/math&gt;, where for every fixed ''k'' there are economical subbases of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{N}^{\wedge}k&lt;/math&gt; of order &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; for every &lt;math&gt;s \geq s_k&lt;/math&gt;, for some large computable constant &lt;math&gt;s_k&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Strong form of Erdős–Turán conjecture on additive bases ===
The original [[Erdős–Turán conjecture on additive bases]] states, in its most general form, that if &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{B}\subseteq\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt; is an additive basis of order ''h'' then &lt;math&gt;r_{\mathcal{B},h}(n) \neq O(1)&lt;/math&gt;. Nonetheless, in his 1956 paper on the case &lt;math&gt;h=2&lt;/math&gt; of Erdős–Tetali, P. Erdős asked whether it could be the case that actually &lt;math&gt;r_{\mathcal{B},2}(n) \neq o(\log(n))&lt;/math&gt; whenever &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{B}\subseteq\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt; is an additive basis of order 2. The question naturally extends to &lt;math&gt;h\geq 3&lt;/math&gt;, making it a way stronger assertion than that of Erdős–Turán. In some sense, what is being conjectured is that there are no additive bases substantially more economical than those guaranteed to exist by the Erdős–Tetali theorem.

In [[mathematical logic]], more specifically in the [[proof theory]] of [[first-order logic|first-order theories]], '''extensions by definitions''' formalize the introduction of new symbols by means of a definition. For example, it is common in naive [[set theory]] to introduce a symbol &lt;math&gt;\emptyset&lt;/math&gt; for the set which has no member. In the formal setting of first-order theories, this can be done by adding to the theory a new constant &lt;math&gt;\emptyset&lt;/math&gt; and the new [[axiom]] &lt;math&gt;\forall x(x\notin\emptyset)&lt;/math&gt;, meaning 'for all ''x'', ''x'' is not a member of &lt;math&gt;\emptyset&lt;/math&gt;'. It can then be proved that doing so adds essentially nothing to the old theory, as should be expected from a definition. More precisely, the new theory is a [[conservative extension]] of the old one.

==Definition of relation symbols==
''Let'' &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; be a [[first-order theory]] and &lt;math&gt;\phi(x_1,\dots,x_n)&lt;/math&gt; a formula of &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;x_1&lt;/math&gt;, ..., &lt;math&gt;x_n&lt;/math&gt; are distinct and include the variables free in &lt;math&gt;\phi(x_1,\dots,x_n)&lt;/math&gt;. Form a new first-order theory &lt;math&gt;T'&lt;/math&gt; from &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; by adding a new &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-ary relation symbol &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;, the [[logical axiom]]s featuring the symbol &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; and the new axiom
:&lt;math&gt;\forall x_1\dots\forall x_n(R(x_1,\dots,x_n)\leftrightarrow\phi(x_1,\dots,x_n))&lt;/math&gt;,
called the ''defining axiom'' of &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;.

If &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt; is a formula of &lt;math&gt;T'&lt;/math&gt;, let &lt;math&gt;\psi^\ast&lt;/math&gt; be the formula of &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; obtained from &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt; by replacing any occurrence of &lt;math&gt;R(t_1,\dots,t_n)&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;\phi(t_1,\dots,t_n)&lt;/math&gt; (changing the bound variables in &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; if necessary so that the variables occurring in the &lt;math&gt;t_i&lt;/math&gt; are not bound in &lt;math&gt;\phi(t_1,\dots,t_n)&lt;/math&gt;). Then the following hold:

# &lt;math&gt;\psi\leftrightarrow\psi^\ast&lt;/math&gt; is provable in &lt;math&gt;T'&lt;/math&gt;, and
# &lt;math&gt;T'&lt;/math&gt; is a [[conservative extension]] of &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;.

The fact that &lt;math&gt;T'&lt;/math&gt; is a conservative extension of &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; shows that the defining axiom of &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; cannot be used to prove new theorems. The formula &lt;math&gt;\psi^\ast&lt;/math&gt; is called a ''translation'' of &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt; into &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;. Semantically, the formula &lt;math&gt;\psi^\ast&lt;/math&gt; has the same meaning as &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt;, but the defined symbol &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; has been eliminated.

==Definition of function symbols==
Let &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; be a [[first-order theory]] (with equality) and &lt;math&gt;\phi(y,x_1,\dots,x_n)&lt;/math&gt; a formula of &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;x_1&lt;/math&gt;, ..., &lt;math&gt;x_n&lt;/math&gt; are distinct and include the variables free in &lt;math&gt;\phi(y,x_1,\dots,x_n)&lt;/math&gt;. Assume that we can prove
:&lt;math&gt;\forall x_1\dots\forall x_n\exists !y\phi(y,x_1,\dots,x_n)&lt;/math&gt;
in &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;, i.e. for all &lt;math&gt;x_1&lt;/math&gt;, ..., &lt;math&gt;x_n&lt;/math&gt;, there exists a unique ''y'' such that &lt;math&gt;\phi(y,x_1,\dots,x_n)&lt;/math&gt;. Form a new first-order theory &lt;math&gt;T'&lt;/math&gt; from &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; by adding a new &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-ary function symbol &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;, the [[logical axiom]]s featuring the symbol &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; and the new axiom
:&lt;math&gt;\forall x_1\dots\forall x_n\phi(f(x_1,\dots,x_n),x_1,\dots,x_n)&lt;/math&gt;,
called the ''defining axiom'' of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;.

Let &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt; be any formula of &lt;math&gt;T'&lt;/math&gt;. We define formula &lt;math&gt;\psi^\ast&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; recursively as follows. If the new symbol &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; does not occur in &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt;, let &lt;math&gt;\psi^\ast&lt;/math&gt; be &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt;. Otherwise, choose an occurrence of &lt;math&gt;f(t_1,\dots,t_n)&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; does not occur in the terms &lt;math&gt;t_i&lt;/math&gt;, and let &lt;math&gt;\chi&lt;/math&gt; be obtained from &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt; by replacing that occurrence by a new variable &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt;. Then since &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; occurs in &lt;math&gt;\chi&lt;/math&gt; one less time than in &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt;, the formula &lt;math&gt;\chi^\ast&lt;/math&gt; has already been defined, and we let &lt;math&gt;\psi^\ast&lt;/math&gt; be 
: &lt;math&gt;\forall z(\phi(z,t_1,\dots,t_n)\rightarrow\chi^\ast)&lt;/math&gt;
(changing the bound variables in &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; if necessary so that the variables occurring in the &lt;math&gt;t_i&lt;/math&gt; are not bound in &lt;math&gt;\phi(z,t_1,\dots,t_n)&lt;/math&gt;). For a general formula &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt;, the formula &lt;math&gt;\psi^\ast&lt;/math&gt; is formed by replacing every occurrence of an atomic subformula &lt;math&gt;\chi&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;\chi^\ast&lt;/math&gt;. Then the following hold:

# &lt;math&gt;\psi\leftrightarrow\psi^\ast&lt;/math&gt; is provable in &lt;math&gt;T'&lt;/math&gt;, and
# &lt;math&gt;T'&lt;/math&gt; is a [[conservative extension]] of &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;.

The formula &lt;math&gt;\psi^\ast&lt;/math&gt; is called a ''translation'' of &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt; into &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;. As in the case of relation symbols, the formula &lt;math&gt;\psi^\ast&lt;/math&gt; has the same meaning as &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt;, but the new symbol &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; has been eliminated.

The construction of this paragraph also works for constants, which can be viewed as 0-ary function symbols.

A first-order theory &lt;math&gt;T'&lt;/math&gt; obtained from &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; by successive introductions of relation symbols and function symbols as above is called an '''extension by definitions''' of &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;T'&lt;/math&gt; is a conservative extension of &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;, and for any formula &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;T'&lt;/math&gt; we can form a formula &lt;math&gt;\psi^\ast&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;, called a ''translation'' of &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt; into &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;, such that &lt;math&gt;\psi\leftrightarrow\psi^\ast&lt;/math&gt; is provable in &lt;math&gt;T'&lt;/math&gt;. Such a formula is not unique, but any two of them can be proved to be equivalent in ''T''.

In practice, an extension by definitions &lt;math&gt;T'&lt;/math&gt; of ''T'' is not distinguished from the original theory ''T''. In fact, the formulas of &lt;math&gt;T'&lt;/math&gt; can be thought of as ''abbreviating'' their translations into ''T''. The manipulation of these abbreviations as actual formulas is then justified by the fact that extensions by definitions are conservative.

==Examples==

* Traditionally, the first-order set theory [[Zermelo–Fraenkel axioms|ZF]] has &lt;math&gt;=&lt;/math&gt; (equality) and &lt;math&gt;\in&lt;/math&gt; (membership) as its only primitive relation symbols, and no function symbols. In everyday mathematics, however, many other symbols are used such as the binary relation symbol &lt;math&gt;\subseteq&lt;/math&gt;, the constant &lt;math&gt;\emptyset&lt;/math&gt;, the unary function symbol ''P'' (the power-set operation), etc. All of these symbols belong in fact to extensions by definitions of ZF.
* Let &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; be a first-order theory for [[group (mathematics)|groups]] in which the only primitive symbol is the binary product &lt;math&gt;\cdot&lt;/math&gt;. In ''T'', we can prove that there exists a unique element ''y'' such that ''x.y''=''y.x''=''x'' for every ''x''. Therefore we can add to ''T'' a new constant ''e'' and the axiom
::&lt;math&gt;\forall x(x\cdot e=x\text{ and }e\cdot x=x)&lt;/math&gt;,
:and what we obtain is an extension by definitions &lt;math&gt;T'&lt;/math&gt; of ''T''. Then in &lt;math&gt;T'&lt;/math&gt; we can prove that for every ''x'', there exists a unique ''y'' such that ''x.y''=''y.x''=''e''. Consequently, the first-order theory &lt;math&gt;T''&lt;/math&gt; obtained from &lt;math&gt;T'&lt;/math&gt; by adding a unary function symbol &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; and the axiom
::&lt;math&gt;\forall x(x\cdot f(x)=e\text{ and }f(x)\cdot x=e)&lt;/math&gt;
:is an extension by definitions of ''T''. Usually, &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; is denoted &lt;math&gt;x^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2944">In [[mathematics]], '''Fujita's conjecture''' is a problem in the theories of [[algebraic geometry]] and [[complex manifold]]s, unsolved {{As of|2017|lc=on}}. It is named after Takao Fujita, who formulated it in 1985.

==Statement==
In complex geometry, the conjecture states that for a [[Positive_form#Positive_line_bundles|positive]] [[holomorphic line bundle]] ''L''  on a [[compact space|compact]] complex manifold ''M'', the line bundle ''K''&lt;sub&gt;''M''&lt;/sub&gt; ⊗ ''L''&lt;sup&gt;⊗''m''&lt;/sup&gt; (where ''K''&lt;sub&gt;''M''&lt;/sub&gt; is a [[Canonical bundle|canonical line bundle]] of ''M'') is 
* [[spanned by sections]] when  ''m'' ≥ ''n'' + 1 ;
* [[very ample]] when ''m'' ≥ ''n'' + 2,

where ''n'' is the [[complex dimension]] of ''M''.

Note that for large ''m'' the line bundle ''K''&lt;sub&gt;''M''&lt;/sub&gt; ⊗ ''L''&lt;sup&gt;⊗''m''&lt;/sup&gt; is very ample by the standard [[Serre's vanishing theorem]] (and its complex analytic variant). Fujita conjecture provides an explicit bound on ''m'', which is optimal for [[projective space]]s.

==Known cases==
For surfaces the Fujita conjecture follows from [[Reider's theorem]]. For three-dimensional algebraic varieties Ein and Lazarsfeld in 1993 proved the first part of the Fujita conjecture, i.e. that ''m''≥4 implies global generation.

A '''gamma process''' is a [[random process]] with [[Statistical independence|independent]] [[Gamma distribution|gamma distributed]] increments.  Often written as &lt;math&gt;\Gamma(t;\gamma,\lambda)&lt;/math&gt;, it is a pure-jump [[increasing]] [[Lévy process]] with intensity measure &lt;math&gt;\nu(x)=\gamma x^{-1}\exp(-\lambda x),&lt;/math&gt; for positive &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;. Thus jumps whose size lies in the interval &lt;math&gt;[x,x+dx)&lt;/math&gt; occur as a [[Poisson process]] with intensity &lt;math&gt;\nu(x)dx.&lt;/math&gt; The parameter &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; controls the rate of jump arrivals and the scaling parameter &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; inversely controls the jump size. It is assumed that the process starts from a value 0 at ''t''=0.

The gamma process is sometimes also parameterised in terms of the mean (&lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt;) and variance (&lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt;) of the increase per unit time, which is equivalent to &lt;math&gt;\gamma = \mu^2/v&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\lambda = \mu/v&lt;/math&gt;.

==Properties==

Since we use the  [[Gamma function]] in these properties, we may write the process at time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;X_t\equiv\Gamma(t;\gamma, \lambda)&lt;/math&gt; to eliminate ambiguity.

Some basic properties of the gamma process are:{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

=== Marginal distribution ===
The [[marginal distribution]] of a gamma process at time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; is a [[gamma distribution]] with mean &lt;math&gt;\gamma t/\lambda&lt;/math&gt; and variance &lt;math&gt;\gamma t/\lambda^2.&lt;/math&gt; 

That is, its density &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is given by &lt;math display="block"&gt;f(x;t, \gamma, \lambda) = {\frac {\lambda ^{\gamma t}}{\Gamma (\gamma t)}}x^{\gamma t \,-\,1}e^{-\lambda x}.&lt;/math&gt;

=== Scaling ===
Multiplication of a gamma process by a scalar constant &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is again a gamma process with different mean increase rate.
:&lt;math&gt;\alpha\Gamma(t;\gamma,\lambda) \simeq \Gamma(t;\gamma,\lambda/\alpha)&lt;/math&gt;

=== Adding independent processes ===
The sum of two independent gamma processes is again a gamma process.
:&lt;math&gt;\Gamma(t;\gamma_1,\lambda) + \Gamma(t;\gamma_2,\lambda) \simeq \Gamma(t;\gamma_1+\gamma_2,\lambda)&lt;/math&gt;

=== Moments ===
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{E}(X_t^n) = \lambda^{-n}\Gamma(\gamma t+n)/\Gamma(\gamma t),\ \quad n\geq 0 ,&lt;/math&gt;   where &lt;math&gt;\Gamma(z)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Gamma function]].

=== Moment generating function ===
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{E}\Big(\exp(\theta X_t)\Big) = (1-\theta/\lambda)^{-\gamma t},\  \quad \theta&lt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; 

=== Correlation ===
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Corr}(X_s, X_t) = \sqrt{s/t},\ s&lt;t&lt;/math&gt;, for any gamma process &lt;math&gt;X(t) .&lt;/math&gt;

The gamma process is used as the distribution for random time change in the [[variance gamma process]].

'''George Stephen Boolos''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|uː|l|oʊ|s}};&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKvjIsyYng8 "Can you solve the three gods riddle? - Alex Gendler"]&lt;!--at 0:12--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; September 4, 1940 – May 27, 1996) was an American [[philosopher]] and a [[mathematical logic]]ian who taught at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Van Gelder, Lawrence|authorlink=Lawrence Van Gelder|title=George Boolos, 55, Philosopher|date=30 May 1996|newspaper=NY Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/05/30/us/george-boolos-55-philosopher.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life ==
Boolos graduated from [[Princeton University]] in 1961 with an [[Bachelor of Arts|A.B.]] in [[mathematics]]. [[Oxford University]] awarded him the [[B.Phil.#University of Oxford|B.Phil.]] in 1963. In 1966, he obtained the first [[Ph.D.]] in [[MIT School of Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences#Philosophy|philosophy]] ever awarded by the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], under the direction of [[Hilary Putnam]]. After teaching three years at [[Columbia University]], he returned to MIT in 1969, where he spent the rest of his career until his death from [[cancer]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.mit.edu/philos/www/jjt-rlc-jc.html MIT faculty resolution on Boolos' death]&lt;/ref&gt;

A charismatic speaker well known for his clarity and wit, he once delivered a lecture (1994b) giving an account of [[Gödel's second incompleteness theorem]], employing only words of one syllable. At the end of his viva, [[Hilary Putnam]] asked him, "And tell us, Mr. Boolos, what does the [[analytical hierarchy]] have to do with the real world?" Without hesitating Boolos replied, "It's part of it".

An expert on puzzles of all kinds, in 1993 Boolos reached the London Regional Final of ''[[The Times]]'' [[crossword]] competition. His score was one of the highest ever recorded by an American. He wrote a paper on "[[The Hardest Logic Puzzle Ever]]"—one of many puzzles created by [[Raymond Smullyan]].

== Work ==
Boolos coauthored with [[Richard Jeffrey]] the first three editions of the classic university text on [[mathematical logic]], ''Computability and Logic''. The book is now in its fifth edition, the last two editions updated by [[John P. Burgess]].

[[Kurt Gödel]] wrote the first paper on [[provability logic]], which applies [[modal logic]]—the logic of necessity and possibility—to the theory of [[mathematical proof]], but Gödel never developed the subject to any significant extent. Boolos was one of its earliest proponents and pioneers, and he produced the first book-length treatment of it, ''The Unprovability of Consistency'', published in 1979. The solution of a major unsolved problem some years later led to a new treatment, ''The Logic of Provability'', published in 1993. The modal-logical treatment of provability helped demonstrate the "intensionality" of Gödel's Second Incompleteness Theorem, meaning that the theorem's correctness depends on the precise formulation of the provability predicate. These conditions were first identified by David Hilbert and Paul Bernays in their ''Grundlagen der Arithmetik''. The unclear status of the Second Theorem was noted for several decades by logicians such as Georg Kreisel and Leon Henkin, who asked whether the formal sentence expressing "This sentence is provable" (as opposed to the Gödel sentence, "This sentence is not provable") was provable and hence true. Martin Löb showed Henkin's conjecture to be true, as well as identifying an important "reflection" principle also neatly codified using the modal logical approach. Some of the key provability results involving the representation of provability predicates had been obtained earlier using very different methods by [[Solomon Feferman]].

Boolos was an authority on the 19th-century German mathematician and philosopher [[Gottlob Frege]]. Boolos proved a conjecture due to [[Crispin Wright]] (and also proved, independently, by others), that the system of Frege's ''Grundgesetze'', long thought vitiated by [[Russell's paradox]], could be freed of inconsistency by replacing one of its axioms, the notorious [[Gottlob Frege|Basic Law V]] with [[Hume's Principle]]. The resulting system has since been the subject of intense work.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}

Boolos argued that if one reads the second-order variables in monadic [[second-order logic]] [[plural quantification|plurally]], then second-order logic can be interpreted as having no [[Ontology|ontological commitment]] to entities other than those over which the [[first-order logic|first-order variables]] range. The result is [[plural quantification]]. [[David Lewis (philosopher)|David Lewis]] employed plural quantification in his ''Parts of Classes'' to derive a system in which [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory]] and the [[Peano axioms]] were all theorems. While Boolos is usually credited with [[plural quantification]], [[Peter Simons (academic)|Peter Simons]] (1982) has argued that the essential idea can be found in the work of [[Stanislaw Leśniewski]].

Shortly before his death, Boolos chose 30 of his papers to be published in a book. The result is perhaps his most highly regarded work, his posthumous ''Logic, Logic, and Logic''. This book reprints much of Boolos's work on the rehabilitation of Frege, as well as a number of his papers on [[set theory]], [[second-order logic]] and [[nonfirstorderizability]], [[plural quantification]], [[proof theory]], and three short insightful papers on [[Gödel's Incompleteness Theorem]]. There are also papers on [[Richard Dedekind|Dedekind]], [[Georg Cantor|Cantor]], and [[Bertrand Russell|Russell]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1008">In mathematics, a '''heteroclinic cycle''' is an invariant set in the phase space of a [[dynamical system]]. It is a topological circle of [[equilibrium point]]s and connecting [[heteroclinic orbit]]s. If a heteroclinic cycle is asymptotically stable, approaching trajectories spend longer and longer periods of time in a neighbourhood of successive equilibria.

==Robust heteroclinic cycles==

A robust heteroclinic cycle is one which persists under small changes in the underlying dynamical system. Robust cycles often arise in the presence of symmetry or other constraints which force the existence of invariant hyperplanes. A prototypical example of a robust heteroclinic cycle is the Guckenheimer&amp;ndash;Holmes cycle.

The '''International Mathematical Olympiad''' ('''IMO''') is an annual six-problem [[mathematical olympiad]] for pre-[[college]] students, and is the oldest of the [[International Science Olympiad]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://olympiads.win.tue.nl/imo/|title=International Mathematics Olympiad (IMO)|date=2008-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first IMO was held in [[Romania]] in 1959. It has since been held annually, except in 1980. More than 100 countries, representing over 90% of the world's population, send teams of up to six students,&lt;ref name = "more"/&gt; plus one team leader, one deputy leader, and observers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.akamai.com/html/about/press/releases/2001/press_070401.html|title=The International Mathematical Olympiad 2001 Presented by the Akamai Foundation Opens Today in Washington, D.C.|accessdate=2008-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The content ranges from extremely difficult algebra and pre-calculus problems to problems on branches of mathematics not conventionally covered at school and often not at university level either, such as [[Projective geometry|projective]] and [[complex geometry]], [[functional equations]], [[combinatorics]], and well-grounded [[number theory]], of which extensive knowledge of theorems is required. Calculus, though allowed in solutions, is never required, as there is a principle that anyone with a basic understanding of mathematics should understand the problems, even if the solutions require a great deal more knowledge. Supporters of this principle claim that this allows more universality and creates an incentive to find elegant, deceptively simple-looking problems which nevertheless require a certain level of ingenuity.

The selection process differs by country, but it often consists of a series of tests which admit fewer students at each progressing test. Awards are given to approximately the top-scoring 50% of the individual contestants. Teams are not officially recognized&amp;mdash;all scores are given only to individual contestants, but team scoring is unofficially compared more than individual scores.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imo-register.org.uk/1992-report.html|title=33rd International Mathematical Olympiad|accessdate=2008-03-05|date=1992-07-21|author=Tony Gardiner|publisher=University of Birmingham}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contestants must be under the age of 20 and must not be registered at any [[tertiary institution]]. Subject to these conditions, an individual may participate any number of times in the IMO.&lt;ref name="otago"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maths.otago.ac.nz/home/schools/gifted_children/olympiad.pdf|format=PDF|title=The International Mathematical Olympiad|accessdate=2008-03-05|publisher=AMC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The International Mathematical Olympiad is one of the most prestigious mathematical competitions in the world. In January 2011, Google sponsored €1 million to the International Mathematical Olympiad organization.&lt;ref&gt;[https://europe.googleblog.com/2011/01/giving-young-mathematicians-chance-to.html Google Europe Blog: Giving young mathematicians the chance to shine]. Googlepolicyeurope.blogspot.com (2011-01-21). Retrieved on 2013-10-29.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{see also|List of International Mathematical Olympiads}}
The first IMO was held in [[Romania]] in 1959. Since then it has been held every year except in 1980. That year, it was cancelled due to internal strife in [[Mongolia]].&lt;ref&gt;Turner, Nura D. ''A Historical Sketch of Olympiads: U.S.A. and International'' ''The College Mathematics Journal'', Vol. 16, No. 5 (Nov., 1985), pp. 330-335&lt;/ref&gt; It was initially founded for eastern [[Europe]]an member countries of the [[Warsaw Pact]], under the [[USSR]] bloc of influence, but later other countries participated as well.&lt;ref name = "more"/&gt; Because of this eastern origin, the IMOs were first hosted only in eastern European countries, and gradually spread to other nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sms.math.nus.edu.sg/Simo/Simo.aspx|title=Singapore International Mathematical Olympiad (SIMO) Home Page|accessdate=2008-02-04|publisher=Singapore Mathematical Society}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sources differ about the cities hosting some of the early IMOs. This may be partly because leaders are generally housed well away from the students, and partly because after the competition the students did not always stay based in one city for the rest of the IMO.{{clarify|date=July 2016}} The exact dates cited may also differ, because of leaders arriving before the students, and at more recent IMOs the [[IMO Advisory Board]] arriving before the leaders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.medallia.com/2006/07/norwegian_students_in_internat.html|title=Norwegian Students in International Mathematical Olympiad|accessdate=2008-03-05|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061020100605/http://blog.medallia.com/2006/07/norwegian_students_in_internat.html|archivedate=2006-10-20|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several students, such as [[Zhuo Qun Song]], [[Teodor von Burg]], [[Lisa Sauermann]], [[John Lian]], [[Josh Li]] and [[Christian Reiher]], have performed exceptionally well in the IMO, winning multiple gold medals. Others, such as [[Grigory Margulis]], [[Jean-Christophe Yoccoz]], [[Laurent Lafforgue]], [[Stanislav Smirnov]], [[Terence Tao]], [[Sucharit Sarkar]], [[Grigori Perelman]], [[Ngô Bảo Châu]] and [[Maryam Mirzakhani]] have gone on to become notable [[mathematician]]s. Several former participants have won awards such as the [[Fields Medal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Lord|2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scoring and format==
The examination consists of six problems. Each problem is worth seven points, so the maximum total score is 42 points. No calculators are allowed. The examination is held over two consecutive days; each day the contestants have four-and-a-half hours to solve three problems. The problems chosen are from various areas of secondary school mathematics, broadly classifiable as [[geometry]], [[number theory]], [[algebra]], and [[combinatorics]]. They require no knowledge of [[higher mathematics]] such as [[calculus]] and [[mathematical analysis|analysis]], and solutions are often short and elementary. However, they are usually disguised so as to make the solutions difficult. Prominently featured are algebraic [[inequality (mathematics)|inequalities]], [[complex numbers]], and [[compass and straightedge constructions|construction]]-oriented geometrical problems, though in recent years the latter has not been as popular as before.&lt;ref name="Olson 2004"&gt;{{Harv|Olson|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each participating country, other than the host country, may submit suggested problems to a Problem Selection Committee provided by the host country, which reduces the submitted problems to a shortlist. The team leaders arrive at the IMO a few days in advance of the contestants and form the IMO Jury which is responsible for all the formal decisions relating to the contest, starting with selecting the six problems from the shortlist. The Jury aims to order the problems so that the order in increasing difficulty is Q1, Q4, Q2, Q5, Q3 and Q6. As the leaders know the problems in advance of the contestants, they are kept strictly separated and observed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Djukić|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each country's marks are agreed between that country's leader and deputy leader and coordinators provided by the host country (the leader of the team whose country submitted the problem in the case of the marks of the host country), subject to the decisions of the chief coordinator and ultimately a jury if any disputes cannot be resolved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://imo.wolfram.com/facts.html|title=IMO Facts from Wolfram|accessdate=2008-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Selection process==
[[File:Geo prob diagram.svg|thumb|200px|A stage in the process of solving a problem&lt;sup id="fn_1_back"&gt;[[#fn 1|1]]&lt;/sup&gt; from the [[American Invitational Mathematics Examination|AIME]], part of the [[United States|US]]'s selection process. ]]
{{main|International Mathematical Olympiad selection process}}
The selection process for the IMO varies greatly by country. In some countries, especially those in [[East Asia]], the selection process involves several tests of a difficulty comparable to the IMO itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Liu|1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Chinese contestants go through a camp.&lt;ref&gt;Chen, Wang. Personal interview. February 19, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; In others, such as the United States, possible participants go through a series of easier standalone competitions that gradually increase in difficulty. In the United States, the tests include the [[American Mathematics Competitions]], the [[American Invitational Mathematics Examination]], and the [[United States of America Mathematical Olympiad]], each of which is a competition in its own right. For high scorers in the final competition for the team selection, there also is a [[Mathematical Olympiad Summer Program|summer camp]], like that of China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unl.edu/amc/|title=The American Mathematics Competitions|accessdate=2008-03-05|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080302084024/http://www.unl.edu/amc/|archivedate=2008-03-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In countries of the former [[Soviet Union]] and other eastern European countries, a team has in the past been chosen several years beforehand, and they are given special training specifically for the event. However, such methods have been discontinued in some countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.austms.org.au/Gazette/1997/Nov97/hunt.html|title=IMO 1997|accessdate=2008-03-05|author=David C. Hunt|publisher=Australian Mathematical Society}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Ukraine]], for instance, selection tests consist of four olympiads comparable to the IMO by difficulty and schedule{{clarify|date=July 2016}}. While identifying the winners, only the results of the current selection olympiads are considered.{{clarify|date=July 2016}}

==Awards==
The participants are ranked based on their individual scores. Medals are awarded to the highest ranked participants; slightly fewer than half of them receive a medal. The cutoffs (minimum scores required to receive a gold, silver or bronze medal respectively) are then chosen so that the numbers of gold, silver and bronze medals awarded are approximately in the ratios 1:2:3. Participants who do not win a medal but who score seven points on at least one problem receive an honorable mention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://imo.wolfram.com/scores/howmedals.html|title=How Medals Are Determined|accessdate=2008-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Special prizes may be awarded for solutions of outstanding elegance or involving good generalisations of a problem. This last happened in 1995 ([[Nikolay Nikolov (mathematician)|Nikolay Nikolov, Bulgaria]]) and 2005 (Iurie Boreico), but was more frequent up to the early 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://olympiads.win.tue.nl/imo/imo95/imo95reg.html|title=IMO '95 regulations|accessdate=2008-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The special prize in 2005 was awarded to Iurie Boreico, a student from Moldova, who came up with a brilliant solution to question 3, which was an inequality involving three variables.

The rule that at most half the contestants win a medal is sometimes broken if it would cause the total number of medals to deviate too much from half the number of contestants. This last happened in 2010 (when the choice was to give either 226 (43.71%) or 266 (51.45%){{clarify|date=July 2016}} of the 517 contestants (excluding the 6 from North Korea — see below) a medal),&lt;ref name="award"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://official.imo2011.nl/year_individual_r.aspx?year=2010|title=51st International Mathematical Olympiad Results|accessdate=2011-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; 2012 (when the choice was to give either 226 (41.24%) or 277 (50.55%) of the 548 contestants a medal), and 2013, when the choice was to give either 249 (47.16%) or 278 (52.65%) of the 528 contestants a medal.

==Penalties==

[[North Korea]] was disqualified for cheating at the 32nd IMO in 1991 and again at the 51st IMO in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imo-official.org/country_team_r.aspx?code=PRK|title=International Mathematical Olympiad: Democratic People's Republic of Korea|accessdate=2010-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the only country to have been accused of cheating.

[[File:International Mathematical Olympiad all-members-gold bar chart.svg|right]]
The following nations have achieved the highest team score in the respective competition:

* [[China]], 19 times (from the first participation in 1985 until 2014): in every year from 1989 to 2014 except 1991, 1994, 1996, 1998, 2003, 2007, 2012;
* [[Soviet Union]], 14 times: in 1963, 1964, 1965, 1966, 1967, 1972, 1973, 1974, 1976, 1979, 1984, 1986, 1988, 1991;

* [[Iran]], once: in 1998;
* [[East Germany]], once: in 1968.

The following nations have achieved an all-members-gold IMO with a full team:

* [[China]], 11 times: in 1992, 1993, 1997, 2000, 2001, 2002, 2004, 2006, 2009, 2010 and 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imo-official.org/country_team_r.aspx?code=CHN|title= Team Results: China at International Mathematical Olympiad}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[United States]], 3 times: in 1994, 2011, and 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imo-official.org/country_team_r.aspx?code=USA|title= Team Results: US at International Mathematical Olympiad}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Russia]], 2 times: in 2002 and 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imo-official.org/country_team_r.aspx?code=RUS|title= Team Results: Russia at International Mathematical Olympiad}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[South Korea]], twice: in 2012 and 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imo-official.org/country_team_r.aspx?code=KOR|title= Team Results: South Korea at International Mathematical Olympiad}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Bulgaria]], once: in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imo-official.org/country_team_r.aspx?code=BGR|title= Team Results: Bulgaria at International Mathematical Olympiad}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The only countries to have their entire team score perfectly in the IMO were the United States in 1994 (they were coached by [[Paul Zeitz]]); and Luxembourg, whose 1-member team had a perfect score in 1981. The US's success earned a mention in ''[[TIME Magazine]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,981185,00.html|title=No. 1 and Counting|accessdate=2010-02-23 | work=Time | date=1994-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hungary won IMO 1975 in an unorthodox way when none of the eight team members received a gold medal (five silver, three bronze). Second place team [[East Germany]] also did not have a single gold medal winner (four silver, four bronze).

Several individuals have consistently scored highly and/or earned medals on the IMO: As of July 2015 Zhuo Qun Song ([[Canada]]) is the most successful participant&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imo-official.org/hall.aspx |title=International Mathematical Olympiad Hall of Fame 2015 |publisher=Imo-official.org |date= |accessdate=2015-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; with five gold medals (including one perfect score in 2015) and one bronze medal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imo-official.org/participant_r.aspx?id=19624 |title=IMO Official Record for Zhuo Qun (Alex) Song |publisher=Imo-official.org |date= |accessdate=2015-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Reid W. Barton|Reid Barton]] ([[United States]]) was the first participant to win a gold medal four times (1998-2001).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/summary/293/5530/597|title=IMO's Golden Boy Makes Perfection Look Easy|accessdate=2008-03-05 | doi=10.1126/science.293.5530.597|volume=293|journal=Science|page=597}}&lt;/ref&gt; Barton is also one of only eight four-time [[William Lowell Putnam Mathematical Competition#Putnam Fellows|Putnam Fellow]]s (2001–04). [[Christian Reiher]] ([[Germany]]), [[Lisa Sauermann]] ([[Germany]]), [[Teodor von Burg]] ([[Serbia]]), and Nipun Pitimanaaree ([[Thailand]]) are the only other participants to have won four gold medals (2000–03, 2008–11, 2009–12, 2010–13, and 2011–14 respectively); Reiher also received a bronze medal (1999), Sauermann a silver medal (2007), von Burg a silver medal (2008) and a bronze medal (2007), and Pitimanaaree a silver medal (2009).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imo-official.org/hall.aspx|title=International Mathematical Olympiad Hall of Fame|accessdate=2009-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Wolfgang Burmeister]] ([[East Germany]]), [[Martin Härterich]] ([[West Germany]]), Iurie Boreico ([[Moldova]]), and Lim Jeck ([[Singapore]]) are the only other participants besides Reiher, Sauermann, von Burg, and Pitimanaaree to win five medals with at least three of them gold.&lt;ref name="more"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imo-register.org.uk/2017-report.pdf|title=Geoff Smith (August 2017). "UK IMO team leader's report". University of Bath. |accessdate=2018-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ciprian Manolescu]] (Romania) managed to write a perfect paper (42 points) for gold medal more times than anybody else in the history of the competition, doing it all three times he participated in the IMO (1995, 1996, 1997).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unl.edu/amc/e-exams/e9-imo/imoteamrecord.shtml|title=IMO team record |accessdate=2008-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Manolescu is also a three-time Putnam Fellow (1997, 1998, 2000).&lt;ref name="putnam"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20000229230334/http://www.maa.org/awards/putnam.html|title=The Mathematical Association of America's William Lowell Putnam Competition|accessdate=2008-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eugenia Malinnikova]] ([[Soviet Union]]) is the highest-scoring female contestant in IMO history. She has 3 gold medals in IMO 1989 (41 points), IMO 1990 (42) and IMO 1991 (42), missing only 1 point in 1989 to precede Manolescu's achievement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Vakil|1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Terence Tao]] (Australia) participated in IMO 1986, 1987 and 1988, winning bronze, silver and gold medals respectively. He won a gold medal when he just turned thirteen in IMO 1988, becoming the youngest person at that time&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/2007/03/13/news/math.php|title=A packed house for a math lecture? Must be Terence Tao|accessdate=2008-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; to receive a gold medal (a feat matched in 2011 by Zhuo Qun Song of [[Canada]]). Tao also holds the distinction of being the youngest medalist with his 1986 bronze medal, alongside 2009 bronze medalist [[Raúl Chávez Sarmiento]] (Peru), at the age of 10 and 11 respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.livinginperu.com/news/9641 |title=Peru won four silver and two bronze medals in International Math Olympiad |date=July 22, 2009 |work=Living in Peru }}&lt;/ref&gt; Representing the United States, [[Noam Elkies]] won a gold medal with a perfect paper at the age of 14 in 1981. Note that both Elkies and Tao could have participated in the IMO multiple times following their success, but entered university and therefore became ineligible.

The current ten countries with the best all-time results are as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imo-official.org/results_country.aspx?column=awards&amp;order=asc|title=Results: Cumulative Results by Country|publisher=imo-official.org|accessdate=2016-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{italic title}}
'''''Introduction to Mathematical Philosophy''''' is a book by [[Bertrand Russell]], published in 1919, written in part to exposit in a less technical way the main ideas of his and [[Alfred North Whitehead|Whitehead]]'s ''[[Principia Mathematica]]'' (1910–13), including the [[theory of descriptions]].

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Mathematics and logic, historically speaking, have been entirely distinct studies.  Mathematics has been connected with science, logic with Greek.  But both have developed in modern times:  logic has become more mathematical and mathematics has become more logical.  The consequence is that it has now become wholly impossible to draw a line between the two;  in fact, the two are one.  They differ as boy and man:  logic is the youth of mathematics and mathematics is the manhood of logic.  This view is resented by logicians who, having spent their time in the study of classical texts, are incapable of following a piece of symbolic reasoning, and by mathematicians who have learnt a technique without troubling to inquire into its meaning or justification.  Both types are now fortunately growing rarer.  So much of modern mathematical work is obviously on the border-line of logic, so much of modern logic is symbolic and formal, that the very close relationship of logic and mathematics has become obvious to every instructed student.  The proof of their identity is, of course, a matter of detail:  starting with premises which would be universally admitted to belong to logic, and arriving by deduction at results which as obviously belong to mathematics, we find that there is no point at which a sharp line can be drawn, with logic to the left and mathematics to the right.  If there are still those who do not admit the identity of logic and mathematics, we may challenge them to indicate at what point, in the successive definitions and deductions of ''Principia Mathematica'', they consider that logic ends and mathematics begins.  It will then be obvious that any answer must be quite arbitrary.  (Russell 1919, 194–195).

'''John Ernest''' (May 6, 1922 – July 21, 1994) was an American-born constructivist abstract artist. He was born in [[Philadelphia]], in 1922. After living and working in Sweden and Paris from 1946 to 1951, he moved to London, [[England]], where he lived and worked from 1951. As a mature student at [[Saint Martin's School of Art]] he came under the influence of [[Victor Pasmore]] and other proponents of [[Constructivism (art)|constructivism]]. During the 1950s together with [[Anthony Hill (artist)|Anthony Hill]], [[Kenneth Martin]], [[Mary Martin (artist)|Mary Martin]], [[Stephen Gilbert]] and [[Gillian Wise]] he became a key member of the British constructivist (a.k.a. constructionist) art movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

John Ernest created both reliefs and free standing constructions. Several of his works are held at [[Tate Britain]], including the Moebius Strip sculpture.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/servlet/ViewWork?cgroupid=999999961&amp;workid=80248&amp;tabview=text&amp;texttype=10 Tate Collection | Moebius Strip by John Ernest], retrieved 2010-03-28.&lt;/ref&gt; He designed both a tower and a large wall relief at the [[International Union of Architects]] congress, South Bank, London, 1961. The exhibition structure also housed works by several of the other British constructivists.

John Ernest had a lifelong fascination with mathematics that is reflected in his work, and together with constructivist artist [[Anthony Hill (artist)|Anthony Hill]] he made contributions to [[graph theory]], studying [[Crossing number (graph theory)|crossing numbers]] of [[complete graph]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

Ernest was an atheist.&lt;ref&gt;"A "practising" atheist, he was a person of great wit, warmth, generosity and hope." Terry Pope, 'Obituary: John Ernest', The Guardian (London), August 18, 1994, Features, Pg. T1&lt;/ref&gt;

More specifically, given a subset ''X'' of the complex plane '''C''' and a function ''f''&amp;nbsp;:&amp;nbsp;''X''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;'''C''', a complex number ''z'' is called a ''lacunary value'' of ''f'' if ''z''&amp;nbsp;∉&amp;nbsp;image(''f'').

Note, for example, that 0 is the only lacunary value of the complex [[exponential function]]. The two [[Picard theorem]]s limit the number of possible lacunary values of certain types of [[holomorphic function]]s.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19022">In [[mathematics]], '''Light's associativity test''' is a procedure invented by F. W. Light for testing whether a [[binary operation]] defined in a [[finite set]] by a [[Cayley table|Cayley multiplication table]] is [[associative]]. The naive procedure for verification of the associativity of a binary operation specified by a Cayley table, which compares the two products that can be formed from each triple of elements, is cumbersome. Light's associativity test simplifies the task in some instances (although it does not improve the worst-case runtime of the naive algorithm, namely &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{O} \left( n^{3} \right)&lt;/math&gt; for sets of size &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;).

==Description of the procedure==

Let a binary operation ' · ' be defined in a finite set ''A'' by a Cayley table. Choosing some element ''a'' in ''A'',  two new binary operations are defined in ''A'' as follows:
:''x'' &lt;math&gt;\star&lt;/math&gt; ''y'' = ''x'' &amp;middot; ( ''a'' &amp;middot; ''y'' )
:''x'' &lt;math&gt;\circ&lt;/math&gt; ''y'' = ( ''x'' &amp;middot;  ''a'' ) &amp;middot; ''y''
The Cayley tables of these operations are  constructed and compared. If the tables coincide then ''x'' · ( ''a'' · ''y'' ) = ( ''x'' ·  ''a'' ) · ''y'' for all ''x'' and ''y''. This is repeated for every element of the set ''A''.

The example below illustrates a further simplification in the procedure for the construction and comparison of the Cayley tables of the operations ' &lt;math&gt;\star&lt;/math&gt; ' and ' &lt;math&gt;\circ&lt;/math&gt; '.

It is not even necessary to construct the Cayley tables of ' &lt;math&gt;\star&lt;/math&gt; ' and ' &lt;math&gt;\circ&lt;/math&gt; ' for ''all'' elements of ''A''. It is enough to compare Cayley tables of ' &lt;math&gt;\star&lt;/math&gt; ' and ' &lt;math&gt;\circ&lt;/math&gt; ' corresponding to the elements in a proper generating subset of ''A''.

==Example==

Consider the binary operation ' · ' in the set ''A'' = { ''a'', ''b'', ''c'', ''d'', ''e'' } defined by the following Cayley table (Table 1):

&lt;center&gt;
{| class="wikitable" border="1" width="20%"
|+Table 1
|-
! ·
! ''a''
! ''b''
! ''c''
! ''d''
! ''e''
|-
| &amp;nbsp; ''' ''a'' '''
| &amp;nbsp; ''a'' 
| &amp;nbsp; ''a''
| &amp;nbsp; ''a''
| &amp;nbsp; ''d''
| &amp;nbsp; ''d''
|-
| &amp;nbsp; ''' ''b'' '''
| &amp;nbsp; ''a''
| &amp;nbsp; ''b''
| &amp;nbsp; ''c''
| &amp;nbsp; ''d''
| &amp;nbsp; ''d''
|-
| &amp;nbsp; ''' ''c'' '''
| &amp;nbsp; ''a''
| &amp;nbsp; ''c''
| &amp;nbsp; ''b''
| &amp;nbsp; ''d''
| &amp;nbsp; ''d''
|-
| &amp;nbsp; ''' ''d'' '''
| &amp;nbsp; ''d''
| &amp;nbsp; ''d''
| &amp;nbsp; ''d''
| &amp;nbsp; ''a''
| &amp;nbsp; ''a''
|-
| &amp;nbsp; ''' ''e'' '''
| &amp;nbsp; ''d''
| &amp;nbsp; ''e''
| &amp;nbsp; ''e''
| &amp;nbsp; ''a''
| &amp;nbsp; ''a''
|}
&lt;/center&gt;

The set { ''c'', ''e'' } is a generating set for the set ''A'' under the binary operation defined by the above table, for,  ''a'' = ''e'' · ''e'', ''b'' = ''c'' · ''c'', ''d'' = ''c'' · ''e''. Thus it is enough to verify that the binary operations ' &lt;math&gt;\star&lt;/math&gt; ' and ' &lt;math&gt;\circ&lt;/math&gt; ' corresponding to ''c'' coincide and also that  the binary operations ' &lt;math&gt;\star&lt;/math&gt; ' and ' &lt;math&gt;\circ&lt;/math&gt; ' corresponding to ''e'' coincide.

To verify that the binary operations ' &lt;math&gt;\star&lt;/math&gt; ' and ' &lt;math&gt;\circ&lt;/math&gt; ' corresponding to ''c'' coincide, choose the row in Table 1 corresponding to the element ''' ''c'' ''':

&lt;center&gt;
{| class="wikitable" border="1" width="20%"
|+Table 2
|-
! ·
! ''a''
! ''b''

| &amp;nbsp; ''a''
| &amp;nbsp; ''a''
| &amp;nbsp; ''d''
| &amp;nbsp; ''d''
|-
| &amp;nbsp; ''' ''b'' '''
| &amp;nbsp; ''a''
| &amp;nbsp; ''b''
| &amp;nbsp; ''c''
| &amp;nbsp; ''d''
| &amp;nbsp; ''d''
|-
| &amp;nbsp; ''' ''c'' '''
|style="background:#ADFF2F"| &amp;nbsp; ''a''
|style="background:#ADFF2F"| &amp;nbsp; ''c''
|style="background:#ADFF2F"| &amp;nbsp; ''b''

|style="background:#ADFF2F"| &amp;nbsp; ''d''
|-
| &amp;nbsp; ''' ''d'' '''
| &amp;nbsp; ''d''
| &amp;nbsp; ''d''
| &amp;nbsp; ''d''
| &amp;nbsp; ''a''
| &amp;nbsp; ''a''
|-
| &amp;nbsp; ''' ''e'' '''
| &amp;nbsp; ''d''
| &amp;nbsp; ''e''
| &amp;nbsp; ''e''
| &amp;nbsp; ''a''
| &amp;nbsp; ''a''
|}
&lt;/center&gt;

This row is copied as the header row of a new table (Table 3):

&lt;center&gt;
{| class="wikitable" border="1" width="20%"
|+Table 3
|-
! &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;

| &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;

|
|}
&lt;/center&gt;

Under the header ''' ''a'' ''' copy the corresponding column in Table 1, under the header ''' ''b'' ''' copy the corresponding column in Table 1, etc., and construct Table 4.

&lt;center&gt;
{| class="wikitable" border="1" width="20%"

| &amp;nbsp; ''e'' 
| &amp;nbsp; ''e'' 
| &amp;nbsp; ''a'' 
| &amp;nbsp; ''a'' 
|}
&lt;/center&gt;

The column headers of Table 4 are now deleted to get Table 5:

&lt;/center&gt;

The Cayley table of the binary operation  ' &lt;math&gt;\star&lt;/math&gt; ' corresponding to the element ''c'' is given by Table 6.

&lt;center&gt;

Next choose the ''' ''c'' ''' column of Table 1:

The Cayley table of the binary operation  ' &lt;math&gt;\circ&lt;/math&gt; ' corresponding to the element ''c'' is given by Table 11.

One can verify that the entries in the various cells in Table 6 agrees with the entries in the corresponding cells of Table 11. This shows that ''x'' · ( ''c'' · ''y'' ) = ( ''x'' · ''c'' ) · ''y'' for all ''x'' and ''y'' in ''A''. If there were some discrepancy then it would not be true that ''x'' · ( ''c'' · ''y'' ) = ( ''x'' · ''c'' ) · ''y'' for all ''x'' and ''y'' in ''A''.

That ''x'' · ( ''e'' · ''y'' ) = ( ''x'' · ''e'' ) · ''y'' for all ''x'' and ''y'' in ''A'' can be verified in a similar way by constructing the following tables (Table 12 and Table 13):

===A further simplification ===

It is not necessary to construct the Cayley tables (Table 6 and table 11) of the binary operations ' &lt;math&gt;\star&lt;/math&gt; ' and ' &lt;math&gt;\circ&lt;/math&gt; '.  It is enough to copy the column corresponding to the header ''' ''c'' '''  in Table 1 to the index column in Table 5 and form the following table (Table 14) and verify that the ''' ''a'' '''-row of Table 14 is identical with the ''' ''a'' '''-row of Table 1,  the ''' ''b'' '''-row of Table 14 is identical with the ''' ''b'' '''-row of Table 1, etc. This is to be repeated ''mutatis mutandis'' for all the elements of the generating set of ''A''.

==Program==
[[Computer software]] can be written to carry out Light's associativity test. Kehayopulu and Argyris have developed such a program for [[Mathematica]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kehayopulu|first=Niovi|author2=Philip  Argyris |year=1993|title=An algorithm for  Light's associativity test using  Mathematica|journal=J. Comput. Inform.|volume=3|issue=1|pages=87&amp;ndash;98|issn=1180-3886}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Extension==

Light's associativity test can be extended to test associativity in a more general context.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.2307/2314731|last=Bednarek|first=A R|year=1968|title=An extension of Light's associativity test|journal=[[American Mathematical Monthly]]|volume=75|issue=5|pages=531&amp;ndash;532|jstor=2314731}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1007/BF02572966|last=Kalman|first=J A|year=1971|title=Bednarek's extension of Light's associativity test|journal=[[Semigroup Forum]]|volume=3|issue=1|pages=275–276}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Let ''T'' = { ''t''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''t''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\ldots&lt;/math&gt;, ''t''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt; } be a [[Magma (algebra)|magma]] in which the operation is denoted by [[Juxtaposition (literary)|juxtaposition]]. Let ''X'' = { ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\ldots&lt;/math&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; } be a set. Let there be a mapping from the [[Cartesian product]] ''T'' &amp;times; ''X'' to ''X'' denoted by  (''t'', ''x'') {{mapsto}} ''tx'' and let it be required to test whether this map has the property

:(''st'')''x'' = ''s''(''tx'')  for all ''s'', ''t'' in ''T''  and all ''x'' in ''X''.

A generalization of Light's associativity test can be applied to verify whether the above property holds or not. In mathematical notations, the generalization runs as follows: For each ''t'' in ''T'', let ''L''(''t'') be the ''m'' &amp;times; ''n'' matrix of elements of ''X'' whose ''i'' - th row is

:( (''t''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;''t'')''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, (''t''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;''t'')''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\ldots&lt;/math&gt; , (''t''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;''t'')''x''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; )  for ''i'' = 1, &lt;math&gt;\ldots&lt;/math&gt;, ''m''

and let ''R''(''t'') be the ''m'' &amp;times; ''n'' matrix of elements of ''X'', the elements of whose ''j'' - th column are

:( ''t''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''tx''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;),  ''t''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(''tx''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;), &lt;math&gt;\ldots&lt;/math&gt; ,  ''t''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt;(''tx''&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;) )  for ''j'' = 1, &lt;math&gt;\ldots&lt;/math&gt;, ''n''.

According to the generalised test (due to Bednarek),  that the property to be verified holds if and only if ''L''(''t'') = ''R''(''t'') for all ''t'' in ''T''. When ''X'' = ''T'', Bednarek's test reduces to Light's test.

==More advanced algorithms==
There is a randomized algorithm by Rajagopalan and [[Leonard Schulman|Schulman]] to test associativity in time proportional to the input size. (The method also works for testing certain other identities.) Specifically, the runtime is &lt;math&gt;O(n^2 \log \frac1\delta)&lt;/math&gt; for an &lt;math&gt;n\times n&lt;/math&gt; table and error probability &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt;. 
The algorithm can be modified to produce a triple &lt;math&gt;\langle a,b,c\rangle&lt;/math&gt; for which &lt;math&gt;(ab)c\ne a(bc)&lt;/math&gt;, if there is one, in time &lt;math&gt;O(n^2 \log n \cdot\log \frac1\delta)&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1137/S0097539797325387 | volume=29 | title=Verification of Identities | journal=SIAM Journal on Computing | pages=1155–1163}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''log sum inequality''' is an [[inequality (mathematics)|inequality]], which is useful for proving several theorems in [[information theory]].

==Statement==
Let &lt;math&gt;a_1,\ldots,a_n&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b_1,\ldots,b_n&lt;/math&gt; be nonnegative numbers.  Denote the sum of all &lt;math&gt;a_i&lt;/math&gt;s by &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and the sum of all &lt;math&gt;b_i&lt;/math&gt;s by &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;.  The log sum inequality states that

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=1}^n a_i\log\frac{a_i}{b_i}\geq a\log\frac{a}{b},&lt;/math&gt;

with equality if and only if &lt;math&gt;\frac{a_i}{b_i}&lt;/math&gt; are equal for all &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;, in other words &lt;math&gt;a_i =c b_i&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;.

==Proof==

Notice that after setting &lt;math&gt;f(x)=x\log x&lt;/math&gt; we have

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\sum_{i=1}^n a_i\log\frac{a_i}{b_i} &amp; {} = \sum_{i=1}^n b_i f\left(\frac{a_i}{b_i}\right)
 = b\sum_{i=1}^n \frac{b_i}{b} f\left(\frac{a_i}{b_i}\right) \\
&amp; {} \geq b f\left(\sum_{i=1}^n \frac{b_i}{b}\frac{a_i}{b_i}\right) = b f\left(\frac{1}{b}\sum_{i=1}^n a_i\right)
= b f\left(\frac{a}{b}\right) \\
&amp; {} = a\log\frac{a}{b},
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
where the inequality follows from [[Jensen's inequality]] since &lt;math&gt;\frac{b_i}{b}\geq 0&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\sum_i\frac{b_i}{b}= 1&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is convex.

==Applications==

The log sum inequality can be used to prove several inequalities in information theory such as [[Gibbs' inequality]] or the convexity of [[KL-divergence|Kullback-Leibler divergence]].

For example, to prove Gibbs' inequality it is enough to substitute &lt;math&gt;p_i&lt;/math&gt;s for &lt;math&gt;a_i&lt;/math&gt;s, and &lt;math&gt;q_i&lt;/math&gt;s for &lt;math&gt;b_i&lt;/math&gt;s to get

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{D}_{\mathrm{KL}}(P\|Q) \equiv \sum_{i=1}^n p_i \log_2 \frac{p_i}{q_i} \geq 1\log\frac{1}{1} = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

==Generalizations==

The inequality remains valid for &lt;math&gt;n=\infty&lt;/math&gt; provided that &lt;math&gt;a&lt;\infty&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;\infty&lt;/math&gt;.
The proof above holds for any function &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;f(x)=xg(x)&lt;/math&gt; is convex, such as all continuous non-decreasing functions. Generalizations to convex functions other than the logarithm is given in Csiszár, 2004.

'''Mathematical sociology''' is the area of [[sociology]] that uses [[mathematics]] to construct social theories.  Mathematical sociology aims to take sociological theory, which is strong in intuitive content but weak from a formal point of view, and to express it in formal terms.  The benefits of this approach include increased clarity and the ability to use mathematics to derive implications of a theory that cannot be arrived at intuitively.  In mathematical sociology, the preferred style is encapsulated in the phrase "constructing a mathematical model."   This means making specified assumptions about some social phenomenon, expressing them in formal mathematics, and providing an empirical interpretation for the ideas.  It also means deducing properties of the model and comparing these with relevant empirical data.  [[Social network analysis]] is the best-known contribution of this subfield to sociology as a whole and to the scientific community at large. The models typically used in mathematical sociology allow sociologists to understand how predictable local interactions are and they are often able to elicit global patterns of social structure.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.soc.cornell.edu/research/mathematical_sociology.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Starting in the early 1940s, [[Nicolas Rashevsky]],&lt;ref&gt;* Nicolas Rashevsky.: 1947/1949 (2nd ed.). ''Mathematical Theory of Human Relations: An Approach to Mathematical Biology of Social Phenomena''. Bloomington, ID: Principia Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;* Nicolas Rashevsky. 1938/1948 (2nd ed.).'' Mathematical Biophysics:Physico-Mathematical Foundations of Biology''., University of Chicago Press : Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and subsequently in the late 1940s, [[Anatol Rapoport]] and others, developed a [[relation algebra|relational]] and probabilistic approach to the characterization of large [[social network]]s in which the nodes are persons and the links are acquaintanceship. During the late 1940s, formulas were derived that connected local parameters such as closure of contacts – if A is linked to both B and C, then there is a greater than chance probability that B and C are linked to each other – to the global network property of connectivity.&lt;ref&gt;Rapoport, Anatol. (1957).  "Contributions to the Theory of Random and Biased Nets." ''Bulletin of Mathematical Biophysics'' 19: 257-277.&lt;/ref&gt;

Moreover, acquaintanceship is a ''positive tie'', but what about ''negative ties'' such as animosity among persons?  To tackle this problem, [[graph theory]], which is the mathematical study of abstract representations of networks of points and lines, can be extended to include these two types of links and thereby to create models that represent both positive and negative sentiment relations, which are represented as [[signed graph]]s.  A signed graph is called ''balanced'' if the product of the signs of all relations in every cycle (links in every graph cycle) is positive.  Through formalization by mathematician [[Frank Harary]] this work produced the fundamental theorem of this theory.  It says that if a network of interrelated positive and negative ties is balanced, e.g. as illustrated by the psychological principle that "my friend's enemy is my enemy", then it consists of two subnetworks such that each has positive ties among its nodes and there are only negative ties between nodes in distinct subnetworks.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright, Dorwin &amp; Harary, Frank. (1956).  "[[Structural Balance]]: A Generalization of Heider's Theory."  ''Psychological Review'' 63:277-293.&lt;/ref&gt;  The imagery here is of a social system that splits into two cliques. There is, however, a special case where one of the two subnetworks is empty, which might occur in very small networks.
In another model, ties have relative strengths. 'Acquaintanceship' can be viewed as a 'weak' tie and 'friendship' is represented as a strong tie.  Like its uniform cousin discussed above, there is a concept of closure, called strong triadic closure.  A graph satisfies strong triadic closure If A is strongly connected to B, and B is strongly connected to C, then A and C must have a tie (either weak or strong).

n these two developments we have mathematical models bearing upon the analysis of structure.  Other early influential developments in mathematical sociology pertained to process.  For instance, in 1952 [[Herbert A. Simon]] produced a mathematical formalization of a published theory&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Homans |first1=George C |title=The Human Group |date=1950 |publisher=Harcourt, Brace and World |location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; of [[social groups]] by constructing a model consisting of a deterministic system of differential equations.  A formal study of the system led to theorems about the dynamics and the implied [[equilibrium state]]s of any group.

The emergence of mathematical models in the social sciences was part of the zeitgeist in the 1940s and 1950s in which a variety of new interdisciplinary scientific innovations occurred, such as [[information theory]], [[game theory]], [[cybernetics]] and mathematical model building in the social and behavioral sciences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Lazarsfeld |first1=Paul F |last2=Henry |first2=Neil W |title=Editors. Readings in Mathematical Social Science |date=1966 |publisher=MIT Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Further developments==

In 1954, a critical expository analysis of Rashevsky's social behavior models was written by sociologist James S. Coleman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Coleman |first1=James S |title=An expository analysis of some of Rashevsky's social behavior models |journal=Mathematical Thinking in the Social Sciences edited by Paul F. Lazarsfeld |date=1954 |issue=New York: The Free Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rashevsky's models and as well as the model constructed by Simon raise a question: how can one connect such theoretical models to the data of sociology, which often take the form of surveys in which the results are expressed in the form of proportions of people believing or doing something.  This suggests deriving the equations from assumptions about the chances of an individual changing state in a small interval of time, a procedure well known in the mathematics of [[stochastic processes]].

Coleman embodied this idea in his 1964 book ''Introduction to Mathematical Sociology'', which showed how stochastic processes in social networks could be analyzed in such a way as to enable testing of the constructed model by comparison with the relevant data. The same idea can and has been applied to processes of change in social relations, an active research theme in the study of social networks, illustrated by an empirical study appearing in the journal Science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kossinets |first1=Gueorgi |last2=Watts |first2=Duncan J |title=An empirical analysis of an evolving social network |journal=Science |date=2006 |volume=311 |issue=5757 |pages=88-90}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In other work, Coleman employed mathematical ideas drawn from economics, such as [[general equilibrium theory]], to argue that general social theory should begin with a concept of [[purposive action]] and, for analytical reasons, approximate such action by the use of [[rational choice]] models (Coleman, 1990).  This argument is similar to viewpoints expressed by other sociologists in their efforts to use rational choice theory in sociological analysis although such efforts have met with substantive and philosophical criticisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Coleman |first1=James S |last2=Fararo |first2=Thomas J |title=Rational Choice Theory: Advocacy and Critique. Editors. |date=1992 |publisher=Sage |location=Newbury Park, CA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, structural analysis of the type indicated earlier received a further extension to social networks based on institutionalized social relations, notably those of kinship.  The linkage of mathematics and sociology here involved abstract algebra, in particular, [[group theory]].&lt;ref&gt;White, Harrison C. 1963. An Anatomy of Kinship. Prentice-Hall&lt;/ref&gt;  This, in turn, led to a focus on a data-analytical version of homomorphic reduction of a complex social network (which along with many other techniques is presented in [[Stanley Wasserman|Wasserman]] and Faust 1994&lt;ref&gt;[[Stanley Wasserman|Wasserman, S.]], &amp; Faust, K.. Social Network Analysis: Methods and Applications. New York and Cambridge, ENG: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;).

In regard to Rapoport's random and biased net theory, his 1961 study of a large sociogram, co-authored with Horvath turned out to become a very influential paper. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rapoport |first1=Anatol |last2=Horvath |first2=N J |title=A study of a large sociogram |journal=Behavioral Science |date=1961 |volume=6 |pages=279-291}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was early evidence of this influence. In 1964, Thomas Fararo and a co-author analyzed another large friendship sociogram using a biased net model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Fararo |first1=Thomas J |last2=Sunshine |first2=Morris |title=A Study of Biased Friendship Net |date=1964 |publisher=Youth Development Center and Syracuse University Press |location=Syracuse, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later in the 1960s, Stanley Milgram described the small world problem and undertook a field experiment dealing with it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Milgram |first1=Stanley |title=The small world problem |journal=Psychology Today |date=May 1967}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Travers |first1=Jeffrey |last2=Milgram |first2=Stanley |title=An experimental study of the small world problem |journal=Sociometry |date=1969 |volume=32 |issue=4 |pages=425-443}}&lt;/ref&gt; A highly fertile idea was suggested and applied by Mark Granovetter in which he drew upon Rapoport's 1961 paper to suggest and apply a distinction between weak and strong ties. The key idea was that there was "strength" in weak ties. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Granovetter |first1=Mark |title=The Strength of Weak Ties |journal=American Journal of Sociology |date=1973 |volume=78 |pages=1360-1380}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Some programs of research in sociology employ experimental methods to study social interaction processes.  [[Joseph Berger (sociologist)|Joseph Berger]] and his colleagues initiated such a program in which the central idea is the use of the theoretical concept "expectation state" to construct theoretical models to explain interpersonal processes, e.g., those linking external status in society to differential influence in local group decision-making. Much of this theoretical work is linked to mathematical model building, especially after the late 1970s adoption of a graph theoretic representation of social information processing, as Berger (2000) describes in looking back upon the development of his program of research. In 1962 he and his collaborators explained model building by reference to the goal of the model builder, which could be explication of a concept in a theory, representation of a single recurrent social process, or a broad theory based on a theoretical construct, such as, respectively, the concept of balance in psychological and social structures, the process of conformity in an experimental situation, and stimulus sampling theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Berger |first1=Joseph |last2=Cohen |first2=Bernard P |last3=Snell |first3=J Laurie |last4=Zelditch Jr |first4=Morris |title=Types of Formalization |date=1962 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |location=Boston, MA}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The generations of mathematical sociologists that followed Rapoport, Simon, Harary, Coleman, White and Berger, including those entering the field in the 1960s such as Thomas Fararo, Philip Bonacich, and Tom Mayer, among others, drew upon their work in a variety of ways.

==Present research==
{{Expand section|date=April 2010}}
Mathematical sociology remains a small subfield within the discipline, but it has succeeded in spawning a number of other subfields which share its goals of formally modeling social life.  The foremost of these fields is [[social network analysis]], which has become among the fastest growing areas of sociology in the 21st century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Scott |first1=John |title=Social Network Analysis. 4th Edition. |date=2017 |publisher=Sage |location=Thousand Oaks, CA}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The other major development in the field is the rise of [[computational sociology]], which expands the mathematical toolkit with the use of [[computer simulation]]s, [[artificial intelligence]] and advanced statistical methods.  The latter subfield also makes use of the vast new data sets on social activity generated by social interaction on the internet.

One important indicator of the significance of mathematical sociology is that the general interest journals in the field, including such central journals as ''The American Journal of Sociology'' and ''The American Sociological Review'', have published mathematical models that became influential in the field at large.  

More recent trends in mathematical sociology are evident in contributions to ''The Journal of Mathematical Sociology'' (JMS).  Several trends stand out: the further development of formal theories that explain experimental data dealing with small group processes, the continuing interest in structural balance as a major mathematical and theoretical idea, the interpenetration of mathematical models oriented to theory and innovative quantitative techniques relating to methodology, the use of computer simulations to study problems in social complexity, interest in [[micro–macro linkage]] and the problem of emergence, and ever-increasing research on networks of social relations.  
 
Thus, topics from the earliest days, like balance and network models, continue to be of contemporary interest. The formal techniques employed remain many of the standard and well-known methods of mathematics: differential equations, stochastic processes and game theory. Newer tools like agent-based models used in computer simulation studies are prominently represented. Perennial substantive problems still drive research: [[social diffusion]], [[social influence]], [[social status]] origins and consequences, segregation, cooperation, [[collective action]], power, and much more.
 
== Research programs== 
Many of the developments in mathematical sociology, including [[Formal theory (political science)|formal theory]], have exhibited notable decades-long advances that began with path-setting contributions by leading mathematical sociologists and formal theorists.  This provides another way of taking note of recent contributions but with an emphasis on continuity with early work through the use of the idea of “[[research program]],” which is a coherent series of theoretical and empirical studies based on some fundamental principle or approach.  There are more than a few of these programs and what follows is no more than a brief capsule description of leading exemplars of this idea in which there is an emphasis on the originating leadership in each program and its further development over decades.

(1) [[Rational Choice Theory]] and James S. Coleman: After his 1964 pioneering ''Introduction to Mathematical Sociology'', Coleman continued to make contributions to social theory and mathematical model building and his 1990 volume, ''Foundations of Social Theory'' was the major theoretical work of a career that spanned the period from 1950s to 1990s and included many other research-based contributions..&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Clark |first1=Jon  Editor |title=James S Coleman |date=1996 |publisher=Routledge. Taylor and Francis Group |location=London, UK}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Foundation book combined accessible examples of how rational choice theory could function in the analysis of such sociological topics as authority, [[trust (emotion)|trust]], [[social capital]] and the [[Social norm|norm]]s (in particular, their emergence).  In this way, the book showed how rational choice theory could provide an effective basis for making the transition from micro to macro levels of sociological explanation.  An important feature of the book is its use of mathematical ideas in generalizing the rational choice model to include [[interpersonal sentiment relations]] as modifiers of outcomes and doing so such that the generalized theory captures the original more self-oriented theory as a special case, as point emphasized in a later analysis of the theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Fararo |first1=Thomas J |title=Social Action Systems |date=2001 |publisher=Praeger |location=Westport, CT |pages=255-278 (Ch. 11)}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rationality presupposition of the theory led to debates among sociological theorists&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Coleman |first1=James S. |last2=Fararo |first2=Thomas J. |title=Editors.  Rational Choice Theory: Advocacy and Critique |date=1992 |publisher=Sage}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  Nevertheless, many sociologists drew upon Coleman’s formulation of a general template for micro-macro transition to gain leverage on the continuation of topics central to his and the discipline's explanatory focus on a variety of macrosocial phenomena in which rational choice simplified the micro level in the interest of combining individual actions to account for macro outcomes of social processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Raub |first1=Werner |last2=Buskens |first2=Vincent |last3=Van Assen |first3=Marcel |title=Micro-macro links and microfoundations in sociology |journal=Journal of Mathematical Sociology |date=2011 |volume=35 |pages=1-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
(2) [[Structuralism (Formal)]] and Harrison C. White: In the decades since his earliest contributions, Harrison White has led the field in putting social structural analysis on a mathematical and empirical basis, including the 1970 publication of ''Chains of Opportunity: System Models of Mobility in Organization''s which set out and applied to data a [[vacancy chain]] model for mobility in and across organizations.   His very influential other work includes the operational concepts of [[blockmodel]] and [[structural equivalence]] which start from a body of social relational data to produce analytical results using these procedures and concepts.   These ideas and methods were developed in collaboration with his former students [[François Lorraine]], [[Ronald Breiger]], and [[Scott Boorman]]. These three are among the more than 30 students who earned their doctorates under White in the period 1963-1986. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Azarian |first1=Reza |title=The General Sociology of Harrison White |date=2003 |publisher=Department of Sociology, Stockholm University |location=Stockholm, Sweden |isbn=91-7265-603-4 |pages=213-216 |ref=Azarian}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The theory and application of blockmodels has been set out in detail in a recent monograph.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Doreian |first1=Patrick |last2=Batagelj |first2=Vladimir |last3=Ferligoj |first3=Anuska |title=Generalized Blockmodeling |date=2004 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge, U.K. |isbn=0-521-84085-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;. White's later contributions include a structuralist approach to markets&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=White |first1=Harrison C. |title=Markets from Networks: Socioeconomic Models of Production |date=2002 |publisher=Princeton University Press |location=Princeton, N.J.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, in 1992, a general theoretical framework&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=White |first1=Harrison C. |title=Identity and Control: A Structural Theory of Social Action |date=1992 |publisher=Princeton University Press |location=Princeton, N.J.}}&lt;/ref&gt;, later appearing in a revised edition&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=White |first1=Harrison C. |title=Identity and Control |date=2008 |publisher=Princeton University Press |location=Princeton, N.J.}}&lt;/ref&gt;.
 
(3) [[Expectation states theory]] and Joseph Berger: Under Berger’s intellectual and organizational leadership, Expectation States Theory branched out into a large number of specific programs of research on specific problems, each treated in terms of the master concept of expectation states.  He and his colleague and frequent collaborator [[Morris Zelditch Jr]] not only produced work of their own but created a doctoral program at Stanford University that led to an enormous outpouring of research by notable former students, including [[Murray Webster]], [[David Wagner (sociologist)|David Wagner]], and [[Hamit Fisek]].  Collaboration with mathematician [[Robert Z. Norman]] led to the use of mathematical graph theory as a way of representing and analyzing social information processing in self-other(s) interactions.  Berger and Zelditch also advanced work in formal theorizing and mathematical model building as early as 1962 with a collaborative expository analysis of types of models.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Berger |first1=Joseph |last2=Cohen |first2=Bernard P. |last3=Snell |first3=J. Laurie |last4=Zelditch Jr |first4=Morris |title=Types of Formalization |date=1962 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |location=Boston, MA}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Berger and Zelditch stimulated advances in other theoretical research programs by providing outlets for the publication of new work, culminating in a 2002 edited volume&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Berger |first1=Joseph |last2=Zelditch Jr |first2=Morris |title=New Directions in Contemporary Sociological Theory |date=2002 |publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield |location=Lanham, MD}}&lt;/ref&gt; that  includes a chapter that presents an authoritative overview of [[Expectation states theory]] as a program of cumulative research dealing with [[group processes]].
 
(4) Formalization in [[Theoretical Sociology]] and Thomas J. Fararo: Many of this sociologist’s contributions have been devoted to bringing mathematical thinking into greater contact with sociological theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Fararo |first1=Thomas J. |title=Editor. Mathematical Ideas and Sociological Theory: Current State and Prospects |date=1984 |publisher=Gordon and Breach |location=New York, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He organized a symposium attended by sociological theorists in which formal theorists delivered papers that were subsequently published in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Fararo |first1=Thomas J. |title=Symposium on Formal Theory |journal=Sociological Theory |date=November 2000 |volume=18 |issue=3 |pages=475-523}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Through collaborations with students and colleagues his own theoretical research program dealt with such topics as [[macrostructural theory]] and [[E-state structuralism]] (both with former student [[John Skvoretz]]), [[subjective images of stratification]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Fararo |first1=Thomas J |last2=Kosaka |first2=Kenji |title=Generating Images of Stratification: A Formal Theory |date=2003 |publisher=Springer |location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; (with former student [[Kenji Kosaka]]), [[tripartite structural analysis]] (with colleague [[Patrick Doreian]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Fararo |first1=Thomas J |last2=Doreian |first2=Patrick |title=Tripartite structural analysis |journal=Social Networks |date=1984 |volume=6 |pages=141-175}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[computational sociology]] (with colleague [[Norman P. Hummon]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hummon |first1=Norman P |last2=Fararo |first2=Thomas J |title=The emergence of computational sociology |journal=Journal of Mathematical Sociology |date=1995 |volume=20 |issue=2-3 |pages=79-87}}&lt;/ref&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hummon |first1=Norman P |last2=Fararo |first2=Thomas J |title=Actors and networks as objects |journal=Social Networks |date=1995 |volume=17 |pages=1-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two of his books are extended treatments of his approach to theoretical sociology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Fararo |first1=Thomas |title=Social Action Systems |date=2001 |publisher=Praeger |location=Westport, CT}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Fararo |first1=Thomas J |title=The Meaning of General Theoretical Sociology: Tradition and Formalization |date=1989 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge, UK}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
(5) Social Network Analysis and [[Linton C. Freeman]]:  In the early 1960s Freeman directed a sophisticated empirical study of [[community power structure]].  In 1978 he established the journal ''Social Networks.''  It rapidly became a major outlet for original research papers that used mathematical techniques to analyze network data.  The journal also publishes conceptual and theoretical contributions, including his paper “[[Centrality]] in Social Networks: Conceptual Clarification.” The paper has been cited more than 13,000 times&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Linton C Freeman |website=Google Scholar}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  In turn, the mathematical concept defined in that paper led to further elaborations of the ideas, to experimental tests, and to numerous applications in empirical studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Freeman |first1=Linton C |last2=Roeder |first2=Douglas |last3=Mulholland |first3=Robert |title=Centrality in social networks II. Experimental results |journal=Social Networks |date=1979-1980 |volume=2 |pages=119-141}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He is the author of a study of the history and sociology of the field of social network analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Freeman |first1=Linton C |title=The development of social network analysis: a study in the sociology of science |date=2004 |publisher=BookSurge |location=North Charleston, SC}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
(6) [[Quantitative Methodology]] and [[Kenneth C. Land]]: Kenneth Land has been on the frontier of quantitative methodology in sociology as well as formal theoretical model building.  The influential yearly volume ''Sociological Methodology'' has been one of Land’s favorite outlets for the publication of papers that often lie in the intersection of quantitative methodology and mathematical sociology.  Two of his theoretical papers appeared early in this journal: “Mathematical Formalization of Durkheim's Theory of Division of Labor” (1970) and “Formal Theory” (1971).  His decades-long research program includes contributions relating to numerous special topics and methods, including [[social statistics]], [[social indicators]], stochastic processes, [[mathematical criminology]], [[demography]] and [[social forecasting]].  Thus Land brings to these fields the skills of a statistician, a mathematician and a sociologist, combined. 
 
(7) [[Affect Control Theory]] and [[David R. Heise]]:  In 1979, Heise published a groundbreaking formal and empirical study in the tradition of interpretive sociology, especially symbolic interactionism,''Understanding Events: Affect and the Construction of Social Action.'' It was the origination of a research program that has included his further theoretical and empirical studies and those of other sociologists, such as  [[Lynn Smith-Lovin]], [[Dawn Robinson]] and [[Neil MacKinnon]]. Definition of the situation and self-other definitions are two of the leading concepts in affect control theory. The formalism used by Heise and other contributors uses a validated form of measurement and a [[cybernetic]] control mechanism in which immediate feelings and compared with fundamental sentiments in such a way as to generate an effort to bring immediate feelings in a situation into correspondence with sentiments. In the simplest models, each person in an interactive pair, is represented in terms of one side of a role relationship in which fundamental sentiments associated with each role guide the process of immediate interaction.  A higher level of the control process can be activated in which the definition of the situation is transformed. This research program comprises several of the key chapters in a  2006 volume&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=McClelland |first1=Kent |last2=Fararo |first2=Thomas |title=Purpose, Meaning and Action: Control Systems Theories in Sociology |date=2006 |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |location=New York, N.Y.}}&lt;/ref&gt; of contributions to control systems theory (in the sense of Powers 1975 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Powers |first1=William |title=Behavior: The Control of Perception |date=1975 |publisher=Aldine |location=Chicago, IL.}}&lt;/ref&gt;) in sociology.
 
(8) "Distributive Justice Theory" and [[Guillermina Jasso]]: Since 1980, Jasso has treated problems of distributive justice with an original theory that uses mathematical methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Jasso |first1=Guillermina |title=A new theory of distributive justice |journal=American Sociological Review |date=1980 |volume=45 |pages=3-32}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has elaborated upon and applied this theory to a wide range of social phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Jasso |first1=Guillermina |title=Curriculum Vitae 2018 |url=http://legacy.iza.org/en/webcontent/personnel/vitae/jasso_cv.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Her most general mathematical apparatus – with the theory of distributive justice as a special case -- deals with any subjective comparison between some actual state and some reference level for it, e.g., a comparison of an actual reward with an expected reward.  In her justice theory, she starts with a very simple premise, the justice evaluation function (the natural logarithm of the ratio of actual to just reward) and then derives numerous empirically testable implications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Jasso |first1=Gullermina |title=Seven secrets of doing theory |journal=New Directions in Contemporary Sociological Theory edited by J Berger and M Zelditch Jr |date=2002 |pages=317-342}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
(9) Collaborative research and John Skvoretz. A major feature of modern science is collaborative research in which the distinctive skills of the participants combine to produce original research.  Skvoretz, in addition to this other contributions, has been a frequent collaborator in a variety of theoretical research programs, often using mathematical expertise as well as skills in experimental design, statistical data analysis and simulation methods.  Some examples are: (1) Collaborative work on theoretical, statistical and mathematical problems in biased net theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Skvoretz |first1=John |last2=Fararo |first2=Thomas J |last3=Agneessens |first3=F |title=Advances in biased net theory:Definitions, derivations, and estimations |journal=Social Networks |date=2004 |volume=26 |pages=113-139}}&lt;/ref&gt;  (2) Collaborative contributions to Expectation States Theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Skvoretz |first1=John |last2=Fararo |first2=Thomas J |title=Status and participation in task groups: A dynamic network model |journal=American Journal of Sociology |date=1996 |volume=101 |pages=1366-1414}}&lt;/ref&gt; (3) Collaborative contributions to [[Elementary Theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Skvoretz |first1=John |last2=Willer |first2=Dave |title=Exclusion and power: a test of four theories of power in exchange networks |journal=American Sociological Review |date=1993 |volume=58 |pages=801-818}}&lt;/ref&gt; (4) Collaboration with [[Bruce Mayhew]] in a structuralist research program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Skvoretz |first1=John |last2=Mayhew |first2=Bruce |title=The structure of stratified systems and the structure of mobility: a first approximation to a structural theory of vertical mobility |journal=Journal of Mathematical Sociology |date=1988 |volume=13 |pages=193-242}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the early 1970s, Skvoretz has been one of the most prolific of contributors to the advance of mathematical sociology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Skvoretz |first1=John |title=Looking backwards into the future: Mathematical sociology then and now |journal=Sociological Theory |date=2000 |volume=18 |pages=510-517}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The above discussion could be expanded to include many other programs and individuals including European sociologists such as [[Peter Abell]] and the late [[Raymond Boudon]].

The section's other categories of awards and their recipients are listed at [http://www.asanet.org/asa-communities/asa-sections/current-sections/mathematical-sociology/mathematical-sociology-section-award-recipients/ ASA Section on Mathematical Sociology]

==Texts and journals==
Mathematical sociology textbooks cover a variety of models, usually explaining the required mathematical background before discussing important work in the literature (Fararo 1973, Leik and Meeker 1975, Bonacich and Lu 2012). An earlier text by [[Otomar Bartos]] (1967) is still of relevance. Of wider scope and mathematical sophistication is the text by Rapoport (1983).  A very reader-friendly and imaginative introduction to explanatory thinking leading to models is Lave and March (1975, reprinted 1993). The ''Journal of Mathematical Sociology'' (started in 1971) has been open to papers covering a broad spectrum of topics employing a variety of types of mathematics, especially through frequent special issues. Other journals in sociology who publish papers with substantial use of mathematics are [https://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/10588 Computational and Mathematical Organization Theory], [https://www.cmu.edu/joss/index.html Journal of social structure], [http://jasss.soc.surrey.ac.uk/JASSS.html Journal of Artificial Societies and Social Simulation] 

Articles in ''Social Networks,'' a journal devoted to social structural analysis, very often employ mathematical models and related structural data analyses.  In addition – importantly indicating the penetration of mathematical model building into sociological research – the major comprehensive journals in sociology, especially ''The American Journal of Sociology'' and ''The American Sociological Review,'' regularly publish articles featuring mathematical formulations.

A '''mathlete''' is a person who competes in [[List of mathematics competitions|mathematics competitions]] at any level or any age. More specifically, a Mathlete is a student who participates in any of the [[Mathcounts|MATHCOUNTS]] programs, as Mathlete is a [[Registered trademark symbol|registered trademark]] of the MATHCOUNTS Foundation in the United States&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://trademarks.justia.com/761/61/mathlete-76161336.html|title=MATHLETE Trademark of MATHCOUNTS Foundation - Registration Number 2754939 - Serial Number 76161336 :: Justia Trademarks|website=trademarks.justia.com|language=en|access-date=2018-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The term is a [[portmanteau]] of the words [[mathematics]] and [[sportsperson|athlete]]. 

Top Mathletes from MATHCOUNTS often go on to compete in the [[American Invitational Mathematics Examination|AIME]], [[United States of America Mathematical Olympiad|USAMO]], and [[American Regions Mathematics League|ARML]] competitions in the United States. Those in other countries generally participate in national olympiads to qualify for the [[International Mathematical Olympiad]].

Participants in [[World Math Day]] also are commonly referred to as mathletes.

==Mathletic Competitions==
The Putnam Exam: The [[William Lowell Putnam Competition]] is the preeminent undergraduate level mathletic competition in the [[United States]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2014}} Administered by the [[Mathematical Association of America]], students compete as individuals and as teams (as chosen by their Institution) for scholarships and team prize money. The exam is administered on the first Saturday in December.&lt;ref&gt;http://math.scu.edu/putnam/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mathletic Off-season Conditioning==
The academic off-season (traditionally referred to as "summer") can be especially difficult on mathletes, though various training regimens have been proposed to keep mathletic ability at its peak. Publications such as the [[Mathematical Association of America|MAA's]] ''[[The American Mathematical Monthly]]'' and the [[American Mathematical Society|AMS's]] ''[[Notices of the American Mathematical Society]]'' are widely read to maintain and hone mathematical ability. Some [[professor|coaches]] suggest seeking research internships or grants, many of which are funded by the [[National Science Foundation]].

At higher levels, mathletes can obtain funding from host institutions to work on summer research projects. For example, the [[University of Delaware]] offers the Groups Exploring the Mathematical Sciences project (GEMS project) to first year graduate students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.math.udel.edu/research/GEMS/index.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-08-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110930073442/http://www.math.udel.edu/research/GEMS/index.html |archivedate=2011-09-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The students act as the principal investigator and work with an undergraduate research assistant and a faculty adviser who will oversee their summer research.

'''Morris Kline''' (May 1, 1908 – June 10, 1992) was a Professor of [[Mathematics]], a writer on the [[history of mathematics|history]], [[philosophy of mathematics|philosophy]], and [[teaching of mathematics]], and also a popularizer of mathematical subjects.

==Education and career==
Kline was born to a Jewish family in [[Brooklyn]] and resided in [[Jamaica, Queens]].  After graduating from [[Boys High School (Brooklyn, New York)|Boys High School]] in Brooklyn, he studied mathematics at [[New York University]], earning a bachelor's degree in 1930, a master's degree in 1932, and a doctorate (Ph. D) in 1936. He continued at NYU as an instructor until 1942.

During [[World War II]], Kline was posted to the [[Signal Corps (United States Army)]] stationed at [[Belmar, New Jersey]]. Designated a [[physicist]], he worked in the engineering lab where [[radar]] was developed. After the war he continued investigating [[electromagnetism]], and from 1946 to 1966 was director of the division for electromagnetic research at the [[Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences]].

Kline resumed his mathematical teaching at NYU, becoming a full [[professor]] in 1952.
He taught at New York University until 1975, and wrote many papers and more than a dozen books on various aspects of mathematics and particularly [[teaching of mathematics]]. He repeatedly stressed the need to teach the applications and usefulness of mathematics rather than expecting students to enjoy it for its own sake. Similarly, he urged that mathematical research concentrate on [[problem solving|solving problems]] posed in other fields rather than building structures of interest only to other mathematicians.
One can get a sense of Kline's views on teaching from the following:
:{{quote|''I would urge every teacher to become an actor. His classroom technique must be enlivened by every device used in theatre. He can be and should be dramatic where appropriate. He must not only have facts but fire. He can utilize even eccentricities of behavior to stir up human interest. He should not be afraid of humor and should use it freely. Even an irrelevant joke or story perks up the class enormously.''&lt;ref&gt;''Mathematics Teacher'' 49:171.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Critique of mathematics education==
Morris Kline was a protagonist in the [[curriculum]] reform in [[mathematics education]] that occurred in the second half of the twentieth century, a period including the programs of the [[new math]]. An article by Kline in 1956 in ''The Mathematics Teacher'', the main journal of the [[National Council of Teachers of Mathematics]], was titled "Mathematical texts and teachers: a tirade".  Calling out teachers blaming students for failures, he wrote "There is a student problem, but there are also three other factors which are responsible for the present state of mathematical learning, namely, the curricula, the texts, and the teachers." The tirade touched a nerve, and changes started to happen. But then Kline switched to being a critic of some of the changes. In 1958 he wrote "Ancients versus moderns: a new battle of the books". The article was accompanied with a rebuttal by Albert E. Meder Jr. of [[Rutgers University]].&lt;ref&gt;''Mathematics Teacher'' 51:428–33&lt;/ref&gt; He says, "I find objectionable: first, vague generalizations, entirely undocumented, concerning views held by ‘modernists’, and second, the inferences drawn from what has not been said by the ‘modernists’." 
By 1966 Kline proposed an eight-page high school plan.&lt;ref&gt;''Mathematics Teacher'' 59:322&amp;ndash;330&lt;/ref&gt; The rebuttal for this article was by James H. Zant; it asserted that Kline had "a general lack of knowledge of what was going on in schools with reference to textbooks, teaching, and curriculum." Zant criticized Kline’s writing for "vagueness, distortion of facts, undocumented statements and overgeneralization."

In 1966&lt;ref&gt;M. Kline (1966) "Intellectuals and the schools: a case history" in [[Harvard Educational Review]] 36:505&amp;ndash;11&lt;/ref&gt; and 1970&lt;ref&gt;M. Kline (1970) "Logic versus pedagogy" in [[American Mathematical Monthly]] (77:264&amp;ndash;82)&lt;/ref&gt; Kline issued two further criticisms. In 1973 [[St. Martin’s Press]] contributed to the dialogue by publishing Kline’s critique, ''Why Johnny Can’t Add: the Failure of the New Math''. Its opening chapter is a [[parody]] of instruction as students’ intuitions are challenged by the new [[jargon]]. The book recapitulates the debates from ''Mathematics Teacher'', with Kline conceding some progress: He cites Howard Fehr of [[Columbia University]] who sought to unify the subject through its general concepts, sets, operations, mappings, relations, and structure in the [[Secondary School Mathematics Curriculum Improvement Study]].

In 1977 Kline turned to undergraduate [[university]] education; he took on the [[academia|academic mathematics establishment]] with his ''Why the Professor Can’t Teach: the dilemma of university education''. Kline argues that onus to conduct [[research]] misdirects the [[scholarly method]] that characterizes good teaching. He lauds scholarship as expressed by expository writing or reviews of original work of others. For scholarship he expects critical attitudes to topics, materials and methods. Among the rebuttals are those by D.T. Finkbeiner, Harry Pollard, and [[Peter Hilton]].&lt;ref&gt;D.T. Finkbeiner, Harry Pollard, Peter Hilton (May 1979) ''American Mathematical Monthly'' 86:401–412&lt;/ref&gt; Pollard conceded, "The society in which learning is admired and pursued for its own sake has disappeared." The Hilton review was more direct: Kline has "placed in the hand of enemies…[a] weapon". Having started in 1956 as an agitator for change in mathematics education, he became a critic of some trends. Skilled expositor that he was, editors frequently felt his expressions were best tempered with rebuttal.

In considering what motivated Morris Kline to protest, consider Professor Meder’s opinion:&lt;ref&gt;''Mathematics Teacher'' 51:433&lt;/ref&gt;I am wondering whether in point of fact, Professor Kline really likes mathematics [...] I think that he is at heart a physicist, or perhaps a ‘natural philosopher’, not a mathematician, and that the reason he does not like the proposals for orienting the secondary school college preparatory mathematics curriculum to the diverse needs of the twentieth century by making use of some concepts developed in mathematics in the last hundred years or so is not that this is bad mathematics, but that it minimizes the importance of physics.

It might appear so, as Kline recalls [[E. H. Moore]]’s recommendation to combine science and mathematics at the high school level.&lt;ref&gt;''Why Johnny Can’t Add'', page 147&lt;/ref&gt; But closer reading shows Kline calling mathematics a "part of man’s efforts to understand and master his world", and he sees that role in a broad spectrum of sciences.

== Critique of mathematics research ==
In ''[[Mathematics: The Loss of Certainty]]'' (ch. XIII: "The Isolation of Mathematics"), Kline deplored the way [[mathematics research]] was being conducted, complaining that often mathematicians, not willing to become acquainted with the (sometimes deep) context needed to solve applied problems in sciences, prefer to invent [[pure mathematics]] problems that are not necessarily of any consequence. Kline also blamed the [[publish or perish]] academic culture for this state of affairs.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

The '''narrow escape problem'''  &lt;ref&gt;Z. Schuss, A. Singer, and D. Holcman ''The narrow escape problem for diffusion in cellular microdomains'' Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2007;104(41):16098–103 &lt;/ref&gt;  &lt;ref&gt; D Holcman, Z Schuss, The narrow escape problem SIAM Review 56 (2), 213-257 (2014) &lt;/ref&gt;  is a ubiquitous problem in [[biology]], [[biophysics]] and [[cellular biology]].

The mathematical formulation is the following: a [[Brownian motion|Brownian particle]] ([[ion]], [[molecule]], or [[protein]]) is confined to a bounded domain (a compartment or a cell) by a [[reflecting boundary]], except for a small window through which it can escape.  The narrow escape problem is that of calculating the mean escape time.  This time diverges as the window shrinks, thus rendering the calculation a [[singular perturbation]] problem &lt;ref&gt;Singer A, Schuss Z, Holcman D."Narrow escape and leakage of Brownian particles.

When escape is even more stringent due to severe geometrical restrictions at the place of escape, the Narrow Escape Problem becomes the Dire Strait Problem &lt;ref&gt; D. Holcman Z. Schuss, The dire strait time, SIAM Multiscale Modeling and simulations, 10(4), 1204–1231.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt; D. Holcman Z.

== Formulation ==
The  motion of a particle is described by the [[Smoluchowski]] limit of the [[Langevin equation]]  &lt;ref&gt;Z. Schuss, Theory and Applications of Stochastic Differential Equations (Wiley Series in Probability and Statistics - (1980)  &lt;/ref&gt;  &lt;ref&gt; Z. Schuss, Theory and Applications of Stochastic Processes. An Analytical Approach. Series: Applied Mathematical Sciences, Vol. 170.&lt;/ref&gt;:

&lt;math&gt;dX_t=\sqrt{2D} \, dB_t+\frac{1}{\gamma}F(x)dt&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; is the [[diffusion coefficient]] of the particle, &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; is the [[friction coefficient]] 
per unit of mass, &lt;math&gt;F(x)&lt;/math&gt; the force per unit of mass, and &lt;math&gt;B_t&lt;/math&gt; is a [[Brownian motion]].

== Mean first passage time and the Fokker-Planck equation ==

A common question is to estimate the mean sojourn time of a particle diffusing in a bounded domain &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; before it escapes through a small absorbing window &lt;math&gt;\partial\Omega_a&lt;/math&gt; in its boundary &lt;math&gt;\partial\Omega&lt;/math&gt;.  The time is estimated asymptotically in the limit &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon= \frac{|\partial\Omega_a|}{|\partial\Omega|} \ll 1&lt;/math&gt;

The [[probability density function]] (pdf) &lt;math&gt;p_{\varepsilon}(x,t)&lt;/math&gt; is the probability of finding the particle at position &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; at time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;.

The pdf satisfies the [[Fokker–Planck equation]] &lt;ref&gt; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_I3FqkQshM &lt;/ref&gt;:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\partial}{\partial t}p_{\varepsilon}(x,t)=D \Delta p_{\varepsilon}(x,t)-\frac{1}{\gamma}\nabla ( p_\varepsilon (x,t) F(x))&lt;/math&gt;
with initial condition

:&lt;math&gt;p_\varepsilon (x,0) = \rho_0(x) \, &lt;/math&gt;

and mixed Dirichlet–Neumann [[boundary conditions]] (&lt;math&gt;t&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;)

:&lt;math&gt;p_\varepsilon (x,t) = 0\text{ for }x \in \partial\Omega_a&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;D\frac{\partial}{\partial n}p_\varepsilon (x,t) - \frac{p_\varepsilon (x,t)}{\gamma} F(x)\cdot n(x)=0 \text{ for }x \in \partial \Omega - \partial\Omega_a&lt;/math&gt;

The function

:&lt;math&gt; u_\varepsilon (y) = \int_\Omega \int_0^\infty p_\varepsilon (x,t y) \, dt \, dx &lt;/math&gt;

represents the mean sojourn time of particle, conditioned on the initial position &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;. It is the solution of the boundary value problem

:&lt;math&gt;D\Delta u_\varepsilon (y) + \frac{1}{\gamma}F(y)\cdot\nabla u_{\varepsilon}(y) = -1 &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;u_\varepsilon (y) = 0\text{ for }y \in \partial\Omega_a&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial u_\varepsilon (y)}{\partial n} = 0\text{ for }y \in \partial\Omega_r&lt;/math&gt;

The solution depends on the dimension of the domain. For a particle diffusing on a two-dimensional disk

:&lt;math&gt;u_\varepsilon (y)=\frac{A}{\pi D}\ln\frac{1}{\varepsilon}+O(1),&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is the surface of the domain. The function &lt;math&gt;u_{\epsilon}(y)&lt;/math&gt;does not depend on the initial position &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;, except for a small boundary layer near the absorbing boundary due to the asymptotic form.

The first order term matters in dimension 2: for a circular disk of radius &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;, the mean escape time of a particle starting in the center is

:&lt;math&gt;E(\tau | x(0)=0 ) = \frac{R^2}{D}\left(\log\left(\frac{1}{\varepsilon}\right) + \log 2 + \frac{1}{4}+O(\varepsilon)\right).&lt;/math&gt;

The escape time averaged with respect to a uniform initial distribution of the particle is given by

:&lt;math&gt;E(\tau ) = \frac{R^2}{D}\left(\log\left(\frac{1}{\varepsilon}\right) + \log 2 + \frac{1}{8} + O(\varepsilon)\right).&lt;/math&gt;

The geometry of the small opening can affect the escape time: if the absorbing window is located at a corner 
of angle &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;, then:

&lt;math&gt;
E\tau = \frac{|\Omega|}{\alpha D} \left[\log \frac{1}{\varepsilon} +O(1)\right].
&lt;/math&gt;

More surprising, near a cusp in a two dimensional domain, the
escape time &lt;math&gt;E\tau&lt;/math&gt; grows algebraically, rather than
logarithmically: in the domain bounded between two tangent circles,
the escape time is :

&lt;math&gt; E\tau = \frac{|\Omega|}{(d-1)D} \left(\frac{1}{\varepsilon} + O(1) \right),  &lt;/math&gt;

where ''d'' &gt; 1 is the ratio of the radii. Finally, when
the domain is an annulus, the escape time to a small opening located
on the inner circle involves a second parameter which is 
&lt;math&gt;\beta = {\frac{R_1}{R_2}} &lt; 1, &lt;/math&gt; the ratio of the inner to the outer
radii,  the escape time, averaged with respect to a uniform initial
distribution, is:

&lt;math&gt;
E\tau = \frac{(R_2^2-R_1^2)}D\left[\log \frac{1}{\varepsilon} +
\log 2 + 2\beta^2 \right]  +\frac{1}{2}\frac{R_2^2}{1-\beta^2}\log\frac{1}{\beta}- \frac{1}{4}R_2^2 +
 O(\varepsilon,\beta^4)R_2^2.
&lt;/math&gt;

This equation  contains two terms of the asymptotic expansion of &lt;math&gt; E\tau&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; 2\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; is the angle of the absorbing boundary. The case &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; close to 1 remains open, and for general domains, the asymptotic expansion of the escape time remains an open problem. So does the problem of computing the escape time near a cusp point in three-dimensional domains. For Brownian motion in a field of force

: &lt;math&gt; F(x)\neq 0 \, &lt;/math&gt;

the gap in the spectrum is not necessarily small between the first and the second eigenvalues, depending on the relative size of the small hole and the force barriers, the particle has to overcome in order to escape. The escape stream is not necessarily Poissonian.

==Analytical Results==

A theorem that relates the Brownian motion escape problem to a (deterministic) partial differential equation problem is the following.

:'''Theorem.''' ''Let &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; be a bounded domain with smooth boundary &lt;math&gt;\partial \Omega&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; be a closed subset of &lt;math&gt;\partial\Omega&lt;/math&gt;. For each &lt;math&gt;x\in\Omega&lt;/math&gt;, let &lt;math&gt;\tau_{x}&lt;/math&gt; be the first time of a particle hitting &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt;, assuming that the particle starts from &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, is subject to the Brownian motion in &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt;, and reflects from &lt;math&gt;\partial\Omega&lt;/math&gt;. Then, the mean first passage time, &lt;math&gt;T(x):=\mathbb{E}[\tau_{x}] &lt;/math&gt;, and its variance, &lt;math&gt;v(x):=\mathbb{E} [(\tau_{x}-T(x))^{2}]&lt;/math&gt;, are solutions of the following boundary value problems:''

::&lt;math&gt;
- \Delta T = 2 \text{ in } \Omega, \text{ } T=0 \text{ on } \Gamma, \text{ } \partial_{n}T=0 \text{ on } \partial \Omega \setminus \Gamma
&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;
- \Delta v = 2 \vert \nabla T \vert^2 \text{ in } \Omega, \text{ } v=0 \text { on } \Gamma, \text{ } \partial_n v = 0 \text{ on } \partial \Omega \setminus \Gamma 
&lt;/math&gt;

Here &lt;math&gt;\partial_{n}:=n\cdot\nabla&lt;/math&gt; is the derivative in the direction &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;, the exterior normal to &lt;math&gt;\partial\Omega.&lt;/math&gt; Moreover, the average of the variance can be calculated from the formula

:&lt;math&gt;
\bar{v} := \frac{1}{\vert \Omega \vert} \int_{\Omega} v(x) dx= \frac{1}{\vert \Omega \vert} \int_{\Omega} T^2(x) dx =:T^2
&lt;/math&gt;

The first part of the theorem is a classical result, while the average variance was proved in 2011 by Carey Caginalp and Xinfu Chen [1,3].

The escape time has been the subject of a number of studies using the small gate as an asymptotically small parameter. The following closed form result [1,3] gives an exact solution that confirms these asymptotic formulae and extends them to gates that are not necessarily small.

:'''Theorem''' (Carey Caginalp and Xinfu Chen Closed Formula).  ''In 2-D, with points identified by complex numbers, let

::&lt;math&gt;
\Omega := \left\{r e^{i \theta} \vert 0 \leq r &lt; 1, \text{ } - \varepsilon \leq \theta \leq 2 \pi - \varepsilon     \right\}, \text{ } \Gamma := \left\{e^{i \theta} \vert \vert \theta \vert \leq \varepsilon \right\}
&lt;/math&gt;

:''Then the mean first passage time &lt;math&gt;T(z)&lt;/math&gt;, for &lt;math&gt;z\in\bar{\Omega}&lt;/math&gt;, is given by
::&lt;math&gt;
T(z) = \frac{1-\vert z \vert^2}{2} + 2 \log{ \left| \frac{1-z+\sqrt{(1-z e^{-i \varepsilon})(1-z e^{i \varepsilon})}}{2\sin{\frac{\varepsilon}{2}}}\right| }
&lt;/math&gt;''
Another set of results concerns the probability density of the location of exit [2]

:'''Theorem''' (Carey Caginalp and Xinfu Chen Probability Density). ''The probability density of the location of a particle at time of its exit is given by
::&lt;math&gt;
\bar{j}(e^{i \theta}) := - \frac{1}{2 \pi} \frac{\partial}{\partial r} T(e^{i \theta}) =
\begin{cases}
0, &amp; \text{if }\varepsilon &lt; \theta &lt; 2 \pi -\varepsilon \\
\frac{1}{2 \pi} \frac{\cos{\frac{\theta}{2}}}{\sqrt {\sin^2{ \frac{\varepsilon}{2}} - \sin^2{ \frac{\theta}{2}}}}, &amp; \text{if } \vert \theta \vert &lt; \varepsilon
\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;''

That is, for any (Borel set) &lt;math&gt;\gamma\subset\partial\Omega&lt;/math&gt;, the probability that a particle, starting either at the origin or uniformly distributed in &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt;, exhibiting Brownian motion in &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt;, reflecting when it hits &lt;math&gt;\partial\Omega\setminus\Gamma&lt;/math&gt;, and escaping once it hits &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt;, ends up escaping from &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; is

:&lt;math&gt;
P( \gamma ) = \int_{\gamma} \bar{j}(y) dS_y
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;dS_{y}&lt;/math&gt; is the surface element of &lt;math&gt;\partial\Omega&lt;/math&gt; at &lt;math&gt;y\in \partial\Omega&lt;/math&gt;.

==Simulations of Brownian Motion Escape==
In simulation there is a random error due to the statistical sampling process. This error can be limited by appealing to the [[Central Limit Theorem]] and using a large number of samples. There is also a discretization error due to the finite size approximation of the step size in approximating the Brownian motion. One can then obtain empirical results as step size and gate size vary. Using the exact result quoted above for the particular case of the circle, it is possible to make a careful comparison of the exact solution with the numerical solution. This illuminates the distinction between finite steps and continuous diffusion. A distribution of exit locations was also obtained through simulations for this problem.

== Biological Applications==

=== Stochastic chemical reactions in microdomains &lt;ref&gt;* Holcman D, Schuss Z., Stochastic chemical reactions in microdomains, J Chem Phys. 2005 Mar 15;122(11):114710.&lt;/ref&gt;===
The forward rate of chemical reactions is the reciprocal of the narrow escape time, which generalizes the classical Smoluchowski formula for Brownian particles located in an infinite medium. A Markov description can be used to estimate the binding and unbinding to a small number of sites.

Mod. Phys.'', March, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; As direct [[quantum entanglement|entangling]] operations with [[photon]]s often require [[nonlinear optics|nonlinear]] effects, probabilistic generation of entangled resource states has been proposed as an alternative path to the direct approach.

==Creation of the cluster state==

On a [[silicon photonic]] chip, one of the most common platforms for implementing LOQC, there are two typical choices for encoding [[quantum information]], though many more options exist.&lt;ref&gt;Rudolph, [https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.08535 "Why I am optimistic about the silicon-photonic route to quantum computing"], ''APL Photonics'', 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Photons have useful degrees of freedom in the spatial modes of the possible photon paths or in the [[photon polarization|polarization]] of the photons themselves. The way in which a [[cluster state]] is generated varies with which encoding has been chosen for implementation.

Storing information in the spatial modes of the photon paths is often referred to as dual rail encoding. In a simple case, one might consider the situation where a photon has two possible paths, a horizontal path with [[creation and annihilation operators|creation operator]] &lt;math&gt;a^\dagger&lt;/math&gt; and a vertical path with creation operator &lt;math&gt;b^\dagger&lt;/math&gt;, where the logical zero and one states are then represented by

::&lt;math&gt;a^\dagger |0_a,0_b\rangle=|1_a,0_b\rangle=|0\rangle_L&lt;/math&gt;

and

::&lt;math&gt;b^\dagger |0_a,0_b\rangle=|0_a,1_b\rangle=|1\rangle_L&lt;/math&gt;.

Single qubit operations are then performed by [[beam splitter]]s, which allow manipulation of the relative superposition weights of the modes, and phase shifters, which allow manipulation of the relative phases of the two modes. This type of encoding lends itself to the Nielsen protocol for generating cluster states. In encoding with [[photon polarization]], logical zero and one can be encoded via the horizontal and vertical states of a photon, e.g.

::&lt;math&gt;|H\rangle=|0\rangle_L&lt;/math&gt;

and

::&lt;math&gt;|V\rangle=|1\rangle_L&lt;/math&gt;.

Given this encoding, single qubit operations can be performed using [[waveplate]]s. This encoding can be used with the Browne-Rudolph protocol.

===Nielsen protocol===

In 2004, Nielsen proposed a protocol to create cluster states,&lt;ref&gt;Nielsen, M., [https://arxiv.org/pdf/quant-ph/0402005 "Optical quantum computation using cluster states"], ''Rev. Mod. Phys.'', July, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; borrowing techniques from the [[KLM protocol|Knill-Laflamme-Milburn protocol]] (KLM protocol) to probabilistically create controlled-Z connections between qubits which, when performed on a pair of &lt;math&gt;|+\rangle=|0\rangle+|1\rangle&lt;/math&gt; states (normalization being ignored), forms the basis for cluster states. While the KLM protocol requires error correction and a fairly large number of modes in order to get very high probability two-qubit gate, Neilsen's protocol only requires a success probability per gate of greater than one half. Given that the success probability for a connection using &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; ancilla photons is &lt;math&gt;n^2/(n+1)^2&lt;/math&gt;, relaxation of the success probability from nearly one to anything over one half presents a major advantage in resources, as well as simply reducing the number of required elements in the photonic circuit.

To see how Nielsen brought about this improvement, consider the photons being generated for qubits as vertices on a two dimensional grid, and the controlled-Z operations being probabilistically added edges between nearest neighbors. Using results from [[percolation theory]], it can be shown that as long as the probability of adding edges is above a certain threshold, there will exist a complete grid as a sub-graph with near unit probability. Because of this, Nielsen's protocol doesn't rely on every individual connection being successful, just enough of them that the connections between photons allow a grid.

===Yoran-Reznik protocol===

Among the first proposals of utilizing resource states for optical quantum computing was the Yoran-Reznik protocol in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;Kok, P. et al., [https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0512071 "Linear optical computing with photonic qubits"], ''Rev. Mod. Phys.'', March, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; While the proposed resource in this protocol was not exactly a cluster state, it brought many of the same key concepts to the attention of those considering the possibilities of optical quantum computing and still required connecting multiple separate one-dimensional chains of entangled photons via controlled-Z operations. This protocol is somewhat unique in that it utilizes both the spatial mode degree of freedom along with the polarization degree of freedom to help entanglement between qubits.

Given a horizontal path, denoted by &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;, and a vertical path, denoted by &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;, a 50:50 beam splitter connecting the paths followed by a &lt;math&gt;\pi/2&lt;/math&gt;-phase shifter on path &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;, we can perform the transformations

::&lt;math&gt;|H,a\rangle\rightarrow\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|H,b\rangle+|V,a\rangle)&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;|V,a\rangle\rightarrow\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|H,a\rangle-|V,b\rangle)&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;|H,b\rangle\rightarrow\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|H,b\rangle-|V,a\rangle)&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;|V,b\rangle\rightarrow\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|H,a\rangle+|V,b\rangle)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;|\lambda,k\rangle&lt;/math&gt; denotes a photon with polarization &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; on path &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;. In this way, we have the path of the photon entangled with its polarization. This is sometimes referred to as hyperentanglement, a situation in which the degrees of freedom of a single particle are entangled with each other. This, paired with the [[Hong-Ou-Mandel effect]] and projective measurements on the polarization state, can be used to create path entanglement between photons in a linear chain.

These one-dimensional chains of entangled photons still need to be connected via controlled-Z operations, similar to the KLM protocol. These controlled-Z connection s between chains are still probabilistic, relying on measurement dependent teleportation with special resource states. However, due to the fact that this method does not include Fock measurements on the photons being used for computation as the KLM protocol does, the probabilistic nature of implementing controlled-Z operations presents much less of a problem. In fact, as long as connections occur with probability greater than one half, the entanglement present between chains will be enough to perform useful quantum computation, on average.

===Browne-Rudolph protocol===

An alternative approach to building cluster states that focuses entirely on photon polarization is the Browne-Rudolph protocol.&lt;ref&gt;Browne, D., Rudolph, T., [https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0405157 "Resource-efficient linear optical quantum computation"], ''Phys. Rev. Lett.'', June, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; This method rests on performing parity checks on a pair of photons to stitch together already entangled sets of photons, meaning that this protocol requires entangled photon sources. Browne and Rudolph proposed two ways of doing this, called type-I and type-II fusion.

====Type-I fusion====

In type-I fusion, photons with either vertical or horizontal polarization are injected into modes &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;, connected by a polarizing beam splitter. Each of the photons sent into this system is part of a Bell pair that this method will try to entangle. Upon passing through the polarizing beam splitter, the two photons will go opposite ways if they have the same polarization or the same way if they have the same polarization, e.g.

::&lt;math&gt;|H_a,H_b\rangle\rightarrow|H_a,H_b\rangle&lt;/math&gt;

or

::&lt;math&gt;|H_a,V_b\rangle\rightarrow|H_aV_a,0_b\rangle&lt;/math&gt;

Then on one of these modes, a projective measurement onto the basis &lt;math&gt;|H\rangle\pm|V\rangle&lt;/math&gt; is performed. If the measurement is successful, i.e. if it detects anything, then the detected photon is destroyed, but the remaining photons from the Bell pairs become entangled. Failure to detect anything results in an effective loss of the involved photons in a way that breaks any chain of entangled photons they were on. This can make attempting to make connections between already developed chains potentially risky.

====Type-II fusion====

Type-II fusion works similarly to type-I fusion, with the differences being that a diagonal polarizing beam splitter is used and the pair of photons is measured in the two-qubit [[Bell state|Bell basis]]. A successful measurement here involves measuring the pair to be in a Bell state with no relative phase between the superposition of states (e.g. &lt;math&gt;|H,H\rangle+|V,V\rangle&lt;/math&gt; as opposed to &lt;math&gt;|H,H\rangle-|V,V\rangle&lt;/math&gt;). This again entangles any two clusters already formed. A failure here performs [[complement graph|local complementation]] on the local subgraph, making an existing chain shorter rather than cutting it in half. In this way, while it requires the use of more qubits in combining entangled resources, the potential loss for attempts to connect two chains together are not as expensive for type-II fusion as they are for type-I fusion.

==Computing with cluster states==

Once a cluster state has been successfully generated, computation can be done with the resource state directly by applying measurements to the qubits on the lattice. This is the model of [[one-way quantum computer|measurement-based quantum computation]] (MQC), and it is equivalent to the [[quantum circuit|circuit model]].

Logical operations in MQC come about from the byproduct operators that occur during [[quantum teleportation]]. For example, given a single qubit state &lt;math&gt;|\psi\rangle&lt;/math&gt;, one can connect this qubit to a plus state (&lt;math&gt;|+\rangle=|0\rangle+|1\rangle&lt;/math&gt;) via a two-qubit controlled-Z operation. Then, upon measuring the first qubit (the original &lt;math&gt;|\psi\rangle&lt;/math&gt;) in the Pauli-X basis, the original state of the first qubit is teleported to the second qubit with a measurement outcome dependent extra rotation, which one can see from the partial inner product of the measurement acting on the two-qubit state:

::&lt;math&gt;
(\left\langle +\right |Z^m\otimes I)CZ(\left |\psi\right\rangle\otimes\left |+\right\rangle)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}HZ^m\left |\psi\right\rangle
&lt;/math&gt;.

for &lt;math&gt;m=0,1&lt;/math&gt; denoting the measurement outcome as either the &lt;math&gt;+1&lt;/math&gt; eigenstate of Pauli-X for &lt;math&gt;m=0&lt;/math&gt; or the &lt;math&gt;-1&lt;/math&gt; eigenstate for &lt;math&gt;m=1&lt;/math&gt;. A two qubit state &lt;math&gt;|\phi\rangle&lt;/math&gt; connected by a pair of controlled-Z operations to the state &lt;math&gt;CZ|+\rangle^{\otimes 2}&lt;/math&gt; yields a two-qubit operation on the teleported &lt;math&gt;|\phi\rangle&lt;/math&gt; state after measuring the original qubits:

::&lt;math&gt;(\langle+|Z^{m_1}\otimes\langle+|Z^{m_2}\otimes I)CZ_{1,3}CZ_{2,4}(|\phi\rangle\otimes CZ|+\rangle^{\otimes 2})=\frac{1}{2}CZ(HZ^{m_1}\otimes HZ^{m_2})|\phi\rangle&lt;/math&gt;.

for measurement outcomes &lt;math&gt;m_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;m_2&lt;/math&gt;. This basic concept extends to arbitrarily many qubits, and thus computation is performed by the byproduct operators of teleportation down a chain. Adjusting the desired single-qubit gates is simply a matter of adjusting the measurement basis on each qubit, and non-Pauli measurements are necessary for universal quantum computation.

==Experimental Implementations==
===Spatial encoding===
[[File:FWM_energy_levels.png|thumb|Four-wave mixing can be thought of as the pair-wise absorption and emission of photons by the electrons in a material.]]
Path-entangled two qubit states have been generated in laboratory settings on silicon photonic chips in recent years, making important steps in the direction of generating optical cluster states. Among methods of doing this, it has been shown experimentally that spontaneous [[four-wave mixing]] can be used with the appropriate use of [[optical ring resonators|microring resonators]] and other [[waveguide]]s for filtering to perform on-chip generation of two-photon Bell states, which are equivalent to two-qubit cluster states up to local unitary operations.

To do this, a short [[laser]] pulse is injected into an on-chip waveguide that splits into two paths. This forces the pulse into a superposition of the possible directions it could go. The two paths are coupled to microring resonators that allow circulation of the laser pulse until spontaneous four-wave mixing occurs, taking two photons from the laser pulse and converting them into a pair of photons, called the signal &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; and idler &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; with different frequencies in a way that conserves energy. In order to prevent the generation of multiple photon pairs at once, the procedure takes advantage of the conservation of energy and ensures that there is only enough energy in the laser pulse to create a single pair of photons. Because of this restriction, spontaneous four-wave mixing can only occur in one of the microring resonators at a time, meaning that the superposition of paths that the laser pulse could take is converted into a superposition of paths the two photons could be on. Mathematically, if &lt;math&gt;|\alpha\rangle&lt;/math&gt; denotes the laser pulse, the paths are labeled as &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;, the process can be written as

::&lt;math&gt;|\alpha\rangle\rightarrow\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|\alpha_a\rangle+|\alpha_b\rangle)\rightarrow
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|1_{s,a},0_{s,b},1_{i,a},0_{i,b}\rangle+|0_{s,a},1_{s,b},0_{i,a},1_{i,b}\rangle)=
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|00\rangle_L+|11\rangle_L)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;|n_{x,y}\rangle&lt;/math&gt; is the representation of having &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; of photon &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; on path &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;. With the state of the two photons being in this kind of superposition, they are entangled, which can be verified by tests of Bell inequalities.

===Polarization encoding===
Polarization entangled photon pairs have also been produced on-chip.&lt;ref&gt;Matsuda, N. et al., [https://www.nature.com/articles/srep00817 "A monolithically integrated polarization entangled photon pair source on a silicon chip"], ''Nature'', November, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The setup involves a silicon wire waveguide that is split in half by a [[polarization rotator]]. This process, like the entanglement generation described for the dual rail encoding, makes use of the nonlinear process of spontaneous four-wave mixing, which can occur in the silicon wire on either side of the polarization rotator. However, the geometry of these wires are designed such that horizontal polarization is preferred in the conversion of laser pump photons to signal and idler photons. Thus when the photon pair is generated, both photons should have the same polarization, i.e.

::&lt;math&gt;|\psi\rangle=|H_s,H_i\rangle&lt;/math&gt;.

The polarization rotator is then designed with the specific dimensions such that horizontal polarization is switched to vertical polarization. Thus any pairs of photons generated before the rotator exit the waveguide with vertical polarization and any pairs generated on the other end of the wire exit the waveguide still having horizontal polarization. Mathematically, the process is, up to overall normalization,

::&lt;math&gt;|\alpha\rangle\rightarrow|\alpha'\rangle+|H_s,H_i\rangle\rightarrow|\alpha'\rangle+|V_s,V_i\rangle\rightarrow|H_s,H_i\rangle+e^{i\phi}|V_s,V_i\rangle&lt;/math&gt;.

Assuming that equal space on each side of the rotator makes spontaneous four-wave mixing equally likely one each side, the output state of the photons is maximally entangled:

::&lt;math&gt;|\psi\rangle=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|H_s,H_i\rangle+e^{i\phi}|V_s,V_i\rangle)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|00\rangle_L+e^{i\phi}|11\rangle_L)&lt;/math&gt;.

States generated this way could potentially be used to build a cluster state using the Browne-Rudolph protocol.

'''Paul Isaac Bernays''' (17 October 1888 – 18 September 1977) was a [[Switzerland|Swiss]] mathematician, who made significant contributions to [[mathematical logic]], [[axiomatic set theory]], and the [[philosophy of mathematics]]. He was an assistant and close collaborator of [[David Hilbert]].

==Biography==
Bernays was born into a distinguished German-Jewish family of scholars and businessmen. His great-grandfather, [[Isaac ben Jacob Bernays]], served as chief rabbi of Hamburg from 1821 to 1849.&lt;ref&gt;{{MacTutor|id=Bernays|title=Paul Isaac Bernays}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bernays spent his childhood in Berlin, and attended the Köllner Gymnasium, 1895–1907. At the [[University of Berlin]], he studied mathematics under [[Issai Schur]], [[Edmund Landau]], [[Ferdinand Georg Frobenius]], and [[Friedrich Schottky]]; philosophy under [[Alois Riehl]], [[Carl Stumpf]] and [[Ernst Cassirer]]; and physics under [[Max Planck]]. At the [[University of Göttingen]], he studied mathematics under [[David Hilbert]], [[Edmund Landau]], [[Hermann Weyl]], and [[Felix Klein]]; physics under Voigt and [[Max Born]]; and philosophy under [[Leonard Nelson]].

In 1912, the [[University of Berlin]] awarded him a Ph.D. in mathematics, for a thesis, supervised by Landau, on the analytic number theory of [[binary quadratic form]]s. That same year, the [[University of Zurich]] awarded him the [[Habilitation]] for a thesis on [[complex analysis]] and [[Picard's theorem]]. The examiner was [[Ernst Zermelo]]. Bernays was Privatdozent at the University of Zurich, 1912–17, where he came to know [[George Pólya]].

Starting in 1917, [[David Hilbert]] employed Bernays to assist him with his investigations of the foundations of arithmetic. Bernays also lectured on other areas of mathematics at the University of Göttingen. In 1918, that university awarded him a second Habilitation, for a thesis on the axiomatics of the [[propositional calculus]] of ''[[Principia Mathematica]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Zach |first=Richard |author-link=Richard Zach |date=1999 |title=Completeness before Post: Bernays, Hilbert, and the development of propositional logic
 |jstor=421184 |journal=Bulletin of Symbolic Logic |volume=5 |issue= |pages=331–366 |doi=10.2307/421184 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1922, Göttingen appointed Bernays extraordinary professor without tenure. His most successful student there was [[Gerhard Gentzen]]. After the passing of the [[Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service]] in 1933, he was dismissed from this post because of his Jewish ancestry. After working privately for Hilbert for six months, Bernays and his family moved to [[Switzerland]], whose nationality he had inherited from his father, and where the [[ETH]] employed him on occasion. He also visited the [[University of Pennsylvania]] and was a visiting scholar at the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] in 1935–36 and again in 1959–60.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ias.edu/people/cos/index.html Institute for Advanced Study: A Community of Scholars]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mathematical work==

Bernays's collaboration with Hilbert culminated in the two volume work [[Grundlagen der Mathematik]] by  {{harvs|txt|last1=Hilbert|last2=Bernays|year1=1934|year2=1939}}, discussed in Sieg and Ravaglia (2005). In seven papers, published between 1937 and 1954 in the ''[[Journal of Symbolic Logic]]'', republished in {{harv|Müller|1976}}, Bernays set out an [[axiomatic set theory]] whose starting point was a related theory [[John von Neumann]] had set out in the 1920s. Von Neumann's theory took the notions of [[function (set theory)|function]] and [[argument of a function|argument]] as primitive; Bernays recast von Neumann's theory so that [[Class (set theory)|class]]es and [[Set (mathematics)|sets]] were primitive. Bernays's theory, with some modifications by [[Kurt Gödel]], is now known as [[von Neumann–Bernays–Gödel set theory]].
A proof from the ''Grundlagen der Mathematik'' that a sufficiently strong consistent theory cannot contain its own reference functor is now known as the [[Hilbert–Bernays paradox]].

In [[statistical physics]] and [[mathematics]], '''percolation theory''' describes the behaviour of [[Glossary of graph theory|connected]] clusters in a [[random graph]]. The applications of percolation theory to [[materials science]] and other domains are discussed in the article [[percolation]].

==Introduction==&lt;!-- [[Bond percolation]] and [[Site percolation]] redirect to here --&gt;
[[File:perc-wiki.png|thumb|left|A three-dimensional site percolation graph]]
A representative question (and the [[etymology|source]] of the name) is as follows. Assume that some liquid is poured on top of some [[porosity|porous]] material. Will the liquid be able to make its way from hole to hole and reach the bottom? This physical question is [[mathematical model|modelled]] mathematically as a [[Grid graph|three-dimensional network]] of {{math|''n'' × ''n'' × ''n''}} [[graph (discrete mathematics)|vertices]], usually called "sites", in which the [[graph (discrete mathematics)|edge]] or "bonds" between each two neighbors may be open (allowing the liquid through) with probability {{math|''p''}}, or closed with probability {{math|1 – ''p''}}, and they are assumed to be independent. Therefore, for a given {{math|''p''}}, what is the probability that an open path (meaning a path, each of whose links is an "open" bond) exists from the top to the bottom? The behavior for large&amp;nbsp;{{math|''n''}} is of primary interest. This problem, called now '''bond percolation''', was introduced in the mathematics literature by {{harvtxt|Broadbent|Hammersley|1957}},&lt;ref name="BroadbentHammersley2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Broadbent|first1=S. R.|last2=Hammersley|first2=J. M.|title=Percolation processes|journal=Mathematical Proceedings of the Cambridge Philosophical Society|volume=53|issue=3|year=2008|pages=629|issn=0305-0041|doi=10.1017/S0305004100032680|bibcode = 1957PCPS...53..629B }}&lt;/ref&gt; and has been studied intensively by mathematicians and physicists since then.

In a slightly different mathematical model for obtaining a random graph, a site is "occupied" with probability {{math|''p''}} or "empty" (in which case its edges are removed) with probability {{math|1 – ''p''}}; the corresponding problem is called '''site percolation'''. The question is the same: for a given ''p'', what is the probability that a path exists between top and bottom? Similarly, one can ask, given a connected graph at what fraction {{math|1 – ''p''}} of failures the graph will become disconnected (no large component).
[[File:Tube Network Percolation.gif|thumb|A 3D tube network percolation determination]]
The same questions can be asked for any lattice dimension. As is quite typical, it is actually easier to examine [[Infinite graph|infinite]] networks than just large ones. In this case the corresponding question is: does an infinite open cluster exist? That is, is there a path of connected points of infinite length "through" the network?  By [[Kolmogorov's zero–one law]], for any given {{math|''p''}}, the probability that an infinite cluster exists is either zero or one. Since this probability is an increasing function of {{math|''p''}} (proof via [[Coupling (probability)|coupling]] argument), there must be a '''critical''' {{math|''p''}} (denoted by&amp;nbsp;{{math|''p''&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;}}) below which the probability is always 0 and above which the probability is always&amp;nbsp;1. In practice, this criticality is very easy to observe. Even for {{math|''n''}} as small as 100, the probability of an open path from the top to the bottom increases sharply from very close to zero to very close to one in a short span of values of&amp;nbsp;{{math|''p''}}.

[[Image:Bond percolation p 51.png|thumb|Detail of a bond percolation on the square lattice in two dimensions with percolation probability {{math|''p'' {{=}} 0.51}}]] In some cases {{math|''p''&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;}} may be calculated explicitly. For example, for the [[square lattice]] {{math|'''ℤ'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} in two dimensions, {{math|''p''&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} {{sfrac|1|2}}}} for bond percolation, a fact which was an open question for more than 20 years and was finally resolved by [[Harry Kesten]] in the early 1980s,&lt;ref name="BollobásRiordan2006"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bollobás|first1=Béla|last2=Riordan|first2=Oliver|title=Sharp thresholds and percolation in the plane|journal=Random Structures and Algorithms|volume=29|issue=4|year=2006|pages=524–548|issn=1042-9832|doi=10.1002/rsa.20134|arxiv=math/0412510}}&lt;/ref&gt; see {{harvtxt|Kesten|1982}}. A limit case for lattices in many dimensions is given by the [[Bethe lattice]], whose threshold is at {{math|''p''&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} {{sfrac|1|''z'' − 1}}}} for a [[coordination number]]&amp;nbsp;{{math|''z''}}. For most infinite lattice graphs, {{math|''p''&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;}} cannot be calculated exactly.
[[File:Front de percolation.png|thumb]]

==Universality==
The [[Universality (dynamical systems)|universality principle]] states that the numerical value of {{math|''p''&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;}} is determined by the local structure of the graph, whereas the kind of behavior of clusters that is observed below, at, and above {{math|''p''&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;}} is independent of the local structure, and therefore, in some sense these behaviors are more natural to consider than {{math|''p''&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;}} itself. This universality also means that for a given dimension, the various critical exponents, the [[fractal dimension]] of the clusters at {{math|''p''&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;}} is independent of the lattice type and percolation type (e.g., bond or site). However, recently percolation has been performed on a weighted planar stochastic lattice (WPSL) and found that although the dimension of the WPSL coincides with the dimension of the space where it is embedded, its universality class is different from that of all the known planar lattices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hassan | first1 = M.

== Phases ==

===Subcritical and supercritical===

The main fact in the subcritical phase is "exponential decay". That is, when {{math|''p'' &lt; ''p''&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;}}, the probability that a specific point (for example, the origin) is contained in an open cluster (meaning a maximal connected set of "open" edges of the graph) of size {{math|''r''}} decays to zero [[Big O notation#Orders of common functions|exponentially]] in&amp;nbsp;{{math|''r''}}. This was proved for percolation in three and more dimensions by {{harvtxt|Menshikov|1986}} and independently by {{harvtxt|Aizenman|Barsky|1987}}. In two dimensions, it formed part of Kesten's proof that {{math|''p''&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} {{sfrac|1|2}}}}.&lt;ref name="Kesten1982"&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Kesten|first1=Harry|title=Percolation Theory for Mathematicians|year=1982|doi=10.1007/978-1-4899-2730-9|isbn=978-0-8176-3107-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[dual graph]] of the square lattice {{math|'''ℤ'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} is also the square lattice. It follows that, in two dimensions, the supercritical phase is dual to a subcritical percolation process. This provides essentially full information about the supercritical model with {{math|''d'' {{=}} 2}}. The main result for the supercritical phase in three and more dimensions is that,  for sufficiently large&amp;nbsp;{{math|''N''}}, there is{{clarify|reason=With probability one?|date=April 2016}} an infinite open cluster in the two-dimensional slab {{math|'''ℤ'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; × [0, ''N'']&lt;sup&gt;''d'' − 2&lt;/sup&gt;}}. This was proved by {{harvtxt|Grimmett|Marstrand|1990}}.&lt;ref name="GrimmettMarstrand1990"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Grimmett|first1=G. R.|last2=Marstrand|first2=J. M.|title=The Supercritical Phase of Percolation is Well Behaved|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society A: Mathematical, Physical and Engineering Sciences|volume=430|issue=1879|year=1990|pages=439–457|issn=1364-5021|doi=10.1098/rspa.1990.0100|bibcode=1990RSPSA.430..439G}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In two dimensions with {{math|''p'' &lt; {{sfrac|1|2}}}}, there is with probability one a unique infinite closed cluster (a closed cluster is a maximal connected set of "closed" edges of the graph). Thus the subcritical phase may be described as finite open islands in an infinite closed ocean. When {{math|''p'' &gt; {{sfrac|1|2}}}} just the opposite occurs, with finite closed islands in an infinite open ocean. The picture is more complicated when {{math|''d'' ≥ 3}} since {{math|''p''&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; {{sfrac|1|2}}}}, and there is coexistence of infinite open and closed clusters for {{math|''p''}} between {{math|''p''&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;}} and&amp;nbsp;{{math|1 − ''p''&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;}}.

The model has a [[mathematical singularity|singularity]] at the critical point {{math|''p'' {{=}} ''p''&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;}} believed to be of power-law type. [[Critical scaling|Scaling theory]] predicts the existence of [[critical exponents]], depending on the number ''d'' of dimensions, that determine the class of the singularity. When {{math|''d'' {{=}} 2}} these predictions are backed up by arguments from [[conformal field theory]] and [[Schramm–Loewner evolution]], and include predicted numerical values for the exponents. Most of these predictions are conjectural except when the number {{math|''d''}} of dimensions satisfies either {{math|''d'' {{=}} 2}} or {{math|''d'' ≥ 19}}. They include:

* There are no infinite clusters (open or closed)
* The probability that there is an open path from some fixed point (say the origin) to a distance of {{math|''r''}} decreases ''polynomially'', i.e. is [[big O notation|on the order of]] {{math|''r''&lt;sup&gt;''α''&lt;/sup&gt;}} for some&amp;nbsp;{{math|''α''}}
** {{math|''α''}} does not depend on the particular lattice chosen, or on other local parameters. It depends only on the dimension {{math|''d''}} (this is an instance of the [[Universality (dynamical systems)|universality]] principle).
** {{math|''α&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;''}} decreases from {{math|''d'' {{=}} 2}} until {{math|''d'' {{=}} 6}} and then stays fixed.
** {{math|''α''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} −{{sfrac|5|48}}}}
** {{math|''α''&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} −1}}.
* The shape of a large cluster in two dimensions is [[conformal map|conformally invariant]].

See {{harvtxt|Grimmett|1999}}.&lt;ref name="Grimmett1999"&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Grimmett|first1=Geoffrey|title=Percolation|volume=321|year=1999|issn=0072-7830|doi=10.1007/978-3-662-03981-6|series=Grundlehren der mathematischen Wissenschaften|isbn=978-3-642-08442-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 11 or more dimensions, these facts are largely proved using a technique known as the [[lace expansion]]. It is believed that a version of the lace expansion should be valid for 7 or more dimensions, perhaps with implications also for the threshold case of 6 dimensions.  The connection of percolation to the lace expansion is found in {{harvtxt|Hara|Slade|1990}}.&lt;ref name="HaraSlade1990"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hara|first1=Takashi|last2=Slade|first2=Gordon|title=Mean-field critical behaviour for percolation in high dimensions|journal=Communications in Mathematical Physics|volume=128|issue=2|year=1990|pages=333–391|issn=0010-3616|doi=10.1007/BF02108785|bibcode = 1990CMaPh.128..333H }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In two dimensions, the first fact ("no percolation in the critical phase") is proved for many lattices, using duality. Substantial progress has been made on two-dimensional percolation through the conjecture of [[Oded Schramm]] that the [[scaling limit]] of a large cluster may be described in terms of a [[Schramm&amp;ndash;Loewner evolution]]. This conjecture was proved by {{harvtxt|Smirnov|2001}}&lt;ref name="Smirnov2001"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Smirnov|first1=Stanislav|title=Critical percolation in the plane: conformal invariance, Cardy's formula, scaling limits|journal=Comptes Rendus de l'Académie des Sciences, Série I|volume=333|issue=3|year=2001|pages=239–244|issn=0764-4442|doi=10.1016/S0764-4442(01)01991-7|bibcode = 2001CRASM.333..239S |arxiv=0909.4499|citeseerx=10.1.1.246.2739}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the special case of site percolation on the triangular lattice.

==Different models==
*The first model studied was Bernoulli percolation. In this model all bonds are independent.  This model is called bond percolation by physicists.
*A generalization next was introduced as the [[Fortuin–Kasteleyn random cluster model]], which has many connections with the [[Ising model]] and other [[Potts model]]s.
*Bernoulli (bond) percolation on [[complete graph]]s is an example of a [[random graph]].  The critical probability is&amp;nbsp;{{math|''p'' {{=}} {{sfrac|1|''N''}}}}, where {{math|''N''}} is the number of vertices (sites) of the graph.
*[[Bootstrap percolation]] removes active cells from clusters when they have too few active neighbors, and looks at the connectivity of the remaining cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

In [[graph theory]], a '''planar graph''' is a [[graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]] that can be [[graph embedding|embedded]] in the [[plane (geometry)|plane]], i.e., it can be drawn on the plane in such a way that its edges intersect only at their endpoints.  In other words, it can be drawn in such a way that no edges cross each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Trudeau|first=Richard J.|title=Introduction to Graph Theory|year=1993|publisher=Dover Pub.|location=New York|isbn=978-0-486-67870-2|pages=64|url=http://store.doverpublications.com/0486678709.html|edition=Corrected, enlarged republication.|accessdate=8 August 2012|quote=Thus a planar graph, when drawn on a flat surface, either has no edge-crossings or can be redrawn without them.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Such a drawing is called a '''plane graph''' or '''planar embedding of the graph'''. A plane graph can be defined as a planar graph with a mapping from every node to a point on a plane, and from every edge to a [[plane curve]] on that plane, such that the extreme points of each curve are the points mapped from its end nodes, and all curves are disjoint except on their extreme points.

Every graph that can be drawn on a plane can be drawn on the [[sphere]] as well, and vice versa, by means of [[stereographic projection]].

Plane graphs can be encoded by [[combinatorial map]]s.

The [[equivalence class]] of [[topologically equivalent]] drawings on the sphere is called a '''planar map'''. Although a plane graph has an '''external''' or '''unbounded''' [[face (graph theory)|face]], none of the faces of a planar map have a particular status.

Planar graphs generalize to graphs drawable on a surface of a given [[genus (mathematics)|genus]]. In this terminology, planar graphs have [[graph genus]]&amp;nbsp;0, since the plane (and the sphere) are surfaces of genus&amp;nbsp;0. See "[[graph embedding]]" for other related topics.

== Kuratowski's and Wagner's theorems ==

The [[Poland|Polish]] mathematician [[Kazimierz Kuratowski]] provided a characterization of planar graphs in terms of [[Forbidden graph characterization|forbidden graphs]], now known as [[Kuratowski's theorem]]:

:A [[graph (discrete mathematics)#Finite and infinite graphs|finite graph]] is planar [[if and only if]] it does not contain a [[Glossary of graph theory#Subgraphs|subgraph]] that is a [[subdivision (graph theory)|subdivision]] of the [[complete graph]] ''K''&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; or the [[complete bipartite graph]] ''K''&lt;sub&gt;3,3&lt;/sub&gt; ([[utility graph]]).

A [[subdivision (graph theory)|subdivision]] of a graph results from inserting vertices into edges (for example, changing an edge •&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;• to •&amp;mdash;•&amp;mdash;•) zero or more times.
[[Image:Nonplanar no subgraph K 3 3.svg|thumb|An example of a graph with no ''K''&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; or ''K''&lt;sub&gt;3,3&lt;/sub&gt; subgraph. However, it contains a subdivision of ''K''&lt;sub&gt;3,3&lt;/sub&gt; and is therefore non-planar.]]

Instead of considering subdivisions, [[Wagner's theorem]] deals with [[minor (graph theory)|minors]]:

:A finite graph is planar if and only if it does not have ''K''&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; or ''K''&lt;sub&gt;3,3&lt;/sub&gt; as a [[minor (graph theory)|minor]].

A [[minor (graph theory)|minor]] of a graph results from taking a subgraph and repeatedly contracting an edge into a vertex, with each neighbor of the original end-vertices becoming a neighbor of the new vertex.

[[File:Kuratowski.gif|thumb|484px|An animation showing that the [[Petersen graph]] contains a minor isomorphic to the K&lt;sub&gt;3,3&lt;/sub&gt; graph, and is therefore non-planar]]

[[Klaus Wagner (mathematician)|Klaus Wagner]] asked more generally whether any minor-closed class of graphs is determined by a finite set of "[[forbidden minor]]s". This is now the [[Robertson–Seymour theorem]], proved in a long series of papers. In the language of this theorem, ''K''&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; and ''K''&lt;sub&gt;3,3&lt;/sub&gt; are the forbidden minors for the class of finite planar graphs.

== Other planarity criteria ==

In practice, it is difficult to use Kuratowski's criterion to quickly decide whether a given graph is planar. However, there exist fast [[algorithm]]s for this problem: for a graph with ''n'' vertices, it is possible to determine in time [[Big O notation|O]](''n'') (linear time) whether the graph may be planar or not (see [[planarity testing]]).

For a simple, connected, planar graph with ''v'' vertices and ''e'' edges and ''f'' faces, the following simple conditions hold for ''v'' &amp;ge; 3:

* Theorem 1. ''e'' &amp;le; 3''v'' &amp;minus; 6;
* Theorem 2. If there are no cycles of length 3, then ''e'' &amp;le; 2''v'' &amp;minus; 4.
* Theorem 3. ''f'' &amp;le; 2''v'' &amp;minus; 4.

In this sense, planar graphs are [[sparse graph]]s, in that they have only O(''v'') edges, asymptotically smaller than the maximum O(''v''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). The graph ''K''&lt;sub&gt;3,3&lt;/sub&gt;, for example, has 6 vertices, 9 edges, and no cycles of length 3.  Therefore, by Theorem 2, it cannot be planar. Note that these theorems provide necessary conditions for planarity that are not sufficient conditions, and therefore can only be used to prove a graph is not planar, not that it is planar. If both theorem 1 and 2 fail, other methods may be used.

* [[Whitney's planarity criterion]] gives a characterization based on the existence of an algebraic dual;
* [[Mac Lane's planarity criterion]] gives an algebraic characterization of finite planar graphs, via their [[cycle space]]s;
* The [[Fraysseix–Rosenstiehl planarity criterion]] gives a characterization based on the existence of a bipartition of the cotree edges of a depth-first search tree. It is central to the '''left-right [[planarity testing]] algorithm''';

=== Euler's formula ===
{{main|Euler characteristic#Plane graphs}}
'''Euler's formula''' states that if a finite, [[Connectivity (graph theory)|connected]], planar graph is drawn in the plane without any edge intersections, and ''v'' is the number of vertices, ''e'' is the number of edges and  ''f'' is the number of faces (regions bounded by edges, including the outer, infinitely large region), then

:&lt;math&gt;v-e+f=2.&lt;/math&gt;

As an illustration, in the [[butterfly graph]] given above, ''v''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;5, ''e''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;6 and ''f''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;3.  
In general, if the property holds for all planar graphs of ''f'' faces, any change to the graph that creates an additional face while keeping the graph planar would keep ''v''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''e''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''f'' an invariant. Since the property holds for all graphs with ''f''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2, by [[mathematical induction]] it holds for all cases. Euler's formula can also be proved as follows: if the graph isn't a [[tree (graph theory)|tree]], then remove an edge which completes a [[cycle (graph theory)|cycle]]. This lowers both ''e'' and ''f'' by one, leaving ''v'' &amp;minus; ''e''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''f'' constant. Repeat until the remaining graph is a tree; trees have ''v''&amp;nbsp;= &amp;nbsp;''e''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1 and ''f''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1, yielding ''v''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''e''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''f''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2, i. e., the [[Euler characteristic]] is 2.

In a finite, [[Connectivity (graph theory)|connected]], ''[[simple graph|simple]]'', planar graph, any face (except possibly the outer one) is bounded by at least three edges and every edge touches at most two faces; using Euler's formula, one can then show that these graphs are ''sparse'' in the sense that if ''v''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;3:

:&lt;math&gt;e\leq 3v-6.&lt;/math&gt;

[[File:Dodecahedron schlegel diagram.png|thumb|A [[Schlegel diagram]] of a regular [[dodecahedron]], forming a planar graph from a convex polyhedron.]]
Euler's formula is also valid for [[convex polyhedron|convex polyhedra]]. This is no coincidence: every convex polyhedron can be turned into a connected, simple, planar graph by using the [[Schlegel diagram]] of the polyhedron, a [[perspective projection]] of the polyhedron onto a plane with the center of perspective chosen near the center of one of the polyhedron's faces. Not every planar graph corresponds to a convex polyhedron in this way: the trees do not, for example. [[Steinitz's theorem]] says that the [[polyhedral graph]]s formed from convex polyhedra are precisely the finite [[Connectivity (graph theory)|3-connected]] simple planar graphs. More generally, Euler's formula applies to any polyhedron whose faces are [[simple polygon]]s that form a surface [[homeomorphism|topologically equivalent]] to a sphere, regardless of its convexity.

=== Average degree ===

Connected planar graphs with more than one edge obey the inequality &lt;math&gt;2e \ge 3f&lt;/math&gt;, because each face has at least three face-edge incidences and each edge contributes exactly two incidences. It follows via algebraic transformations of this inequality with Euler's formula  &lt;math&gt;v - e + f = 2&lt;/math&gt; that for finite planar graphs the average degree is strictly less than 6. Graphs with higher average degree cannot be planar.

=== Coin graphs ===
{{main|Circle packing theorem}}
[[File:Circle packing theorem K5 minus edge example.svg|thumb|Example of the circle packing theorem on K&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;, the complete graph on five vertices, minus one edge.]]
We say that two circles drawn in a plane ''kiss'' (or ''[[Osculating circle|osculate]]'') whenever they intersect in exactly one point.  A "coin graph" is a graph formed by a set of circles, no two of which have overlapping interiors, by making a vertex for each circle and an edge for each pair of circles that kiss. The [[circle packing theorem]], first proved by [[Paul Koebe]] in 1936,  states that a graph is planar if and only if it is a coin graph.

This result provides an easy proof of [[Fáry's theorem]], that every planar graph can be embedded in the plane in such a way that its edges are straight [[line segment]]s that do not cross each other. If one places each vertex of the graph at the center of the corresponding circle in a coin graph representation, then the line segments between centers of kissing circles do not cross any of the other edges.

=== Planar graph density ===
The density &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; of a planar graph, or network, is defined as a ratio of the number of edges &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; to the number of possible edges in a network with &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; nodes, given by a planar graph &lt;math&gt;(E_{\max}=3N-6)&lt;/math&gt;, giving &lt;math&gt;D = \frac{E-N+1}{2N-5}&lt;/math&gt;. A completely sparse planar graph has &lt;math&gt;D = 0&lt;/math&gt;, alternatively a completely dense planar graph has &lt;math&gt;D = 1&lt;/math&gt;

==Related families of graphs==

===Maximal planar graphs===
[[File:Goldner-Harary graph.svg|thumb|240px|The [[Goldner–Harary graph]] is maximal planar. All its faces are bounded by three edges.]]
A simple graph is called '''maximal planar''' if it is planar but adding any edge (on the given vertex set) would destroy that property. All faces (including the outer one) are then bounded by three edges, explaining the alternative term '''plane triangulation'''. The alternative names "triangular graph"&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=W.|last=Schnyder|title=Planar graphs and poset dimension|journal=[[Order (journal)|Order]]|volume=5|year=1989|pages=323–343|doi=10.1007/BF00353652|mr=1010382}}.&lt;/ref&gt; or "triangulated graph"&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|journal=Algorithmica|volume=3|issue=1–4|year=1988|pages=247–278|doi= 10.1007/BF01762117|title=A linear algorithm to find a rectangular dual of a planar triangulated graph|first1=Jayaram|last1=Bhasker|first2=Sartaj|last2=Sahni}}.&lt;/ref&gt; have also been used, but are ambiguous, as they more commonly refer to the [[line graph]] of a [[complete graph]] and to the [[chordal graph]]s respectively. Every maximal planar is [[k-vertex-connected graph|3-vertex-connected]].

If a maximal planar graph has ''v'' vertices with ''v''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;2, then it has precisely 3''v''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;6 edges and 2''v''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;4 faces.

[[Apollonian network]]s are the maximal planar graphs formed by repeatedly splitting triangular faces into triples of smaller triangles.  Equivalently, they are the planar [[k-tree|3-trees]].

[[Strangulated graph]]s are the graphs in which every [[peripheral cycle]] is a triangle. In a maximal planar graph (or more generally a polyhedral graph) the peripheral cycles are the faces, so maximal planar graphs are strangulated. The strangulated graphs include also the [[chordal graph]]s, and are exactly the graphs that can be formed by [[clique-sum]]s (without deleting edges) of [[complete graph]]s and maximal planar graphs.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

===Outerplanar graphs===
[[Outerplanar graph]]s are graphs with an embedding in the plane such that all vertices belong to the unbounded face of the embedding. Every outerplanar graph is planar, but the converse is not true: ''K''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; is planar but not outerplanar. A theorem similar to Kuratowski's states that a finite graph is outerplanar if and only if it does not contain a subdivision of ''K''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; or of ''K''&lt;sub&gt;2,3&lt;/sub&gt;.

A 1-outerplanar embedding of a graph is the same as an outerplanar embedding.  For ''k''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;1 a planar embedding is ''k''-outerplanar if removing the vertices on the outer face results in a (''k''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1)-outerplanar embedding.  A graph is ''k''-outerplanar if it has a ''k''-outerplanar embedding.

===Halin graphs===
A [[Halin graph]] is a graph formed from an undirected plane tree (with no degree-two nodes) by connecting its leaves into a cycle, in the order given by the plane embedding of the tree. Equivalently, it is a [[polyhedral graph]] in which one face is adjacent to all the others. Every Halin graph is planar. Like outerplanar graphs, Halin graphs have low [[treewidth]], making many algorithmic problems on them more easily solved than in unrestricted planar graphs.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

===Other related families===
An [[apex graph]] is a graph that may be made planar by the removal of one vertex, and a ''k''-apex graph is a graph that may be made planar by the removal of at most ''k'' vertices.

A [[1-planar graph]] is a graph that may be drawn in the plane with at most one simple crossing per edge, and a ''k''-planar graph is a graph that may be drawn with at most ''k'' simple crossings per edge.

A [[map graph]] is a graph formed from a set of finitely many simply-connected interior-disjoint regions in the plane by connecting two regions when they share at least one boundary point. When at most three regions meet at a point, the result is a planar graph, but when four or more regions meet at a point, the result can be nonplanar.

A [[toroidal graph]] is a graph that can be embedded without crossings on the [[torus]]. More generally, the [[genus (mathematics)|genus]] of a graph is the minimum genus of a two-dimensional surface into which the graph may be embedded; planar graphs have genus zero and nonplanar toroidal graphs have genus one.

Any graph may be embedded into three-dimensional space without crossings. However, a three-dimensional analogue of the planar graphs is provided by the [[linkless embedding|linklessly embeddable graphs]], graphs that can be embedded into three-dimensional space in such a way that no two cycles are [[linking number|topologically linked]] with each other. In analogy to Kuratowski's and Wagner's characterizations of the planar graphs as being the graphs that do not contain ''K''&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; or ''K''&lt;sub&gt;3,3&lt;/sub&gt; as a minor, the linklessly embeddable graphs may be characterized as the graphs that do not contain as a minor any of the seven graphs in the [[Petersen family]]. In analogy to the characterizations of the outerplanar and planar graphs as being the graphs with [[Colin de Verdière graph invariant]] at most two or three, the linklessly embeddable graphs are the graphs that have Colin de Verdière invariant at most four.

An [[Upward planar drawing|upward planar graph]] is a [[directed acyclic graph]] that can be drawn in the plane with its edges as non-crossing curves that are consistently oriented in an upward direction. Not every planar directed acyclic graph is upward planar, and it is NP-complete to test whether a given graph is upward planar.

== Enumeration of planar graphs ==
The asymptotic for the number of (labeled) planar graphs on &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; vertices is &lt;math&gt;g\cdot n^{-7/2}\cdot \gamma^n\cdot n!&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\gamma\approx 27.22687&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g\approx 0.43\times 10^{-5}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Giménez | first1 = Omer | last2 = Noy | first2 = Marc | year = 2009 | title = Asymptotic enumeration and limit laws of planar graphs | url = | journal = Journal of the American Mathematical Society | volume = 22 | issue = | pages = 309–329 | doi=10.1090/s0894-0347-08-00624-3| arxiv = math/0501269 | bibcode = 2009JAMS...22..309G }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Almost all planar graphs have an exponential number of automorphisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = McDiarmid | first1 = Colin | last2 = Steger | first2 = Angelika | author2-link = Angelika Steger | last3 = Welsh | first3 = Dominic J.A. | year = | title = Random planar graphs | url = | journal = Journal of Combinatorial Theory, Series B | volume = 93 | issue = 2| pages = 187–205 | doi = 10.1016/j.jctb.2004.09.007 | citeseerx = 10.1.1.572.857 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The number of unlabeled (non-isomorphic) planar graphs on &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; vertices is between &lt;math&gt;27.2^n&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;30.06^n&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bonichon | first1 = N. | last2 = Gavoille | first2 = C. | last3 = Hanusse | first3 = N. | last4 = Poulalhon | first4 = D. | last5 = Schaeffer | first5 = G. | year = 2006 | title = Planar Graphs, via Well-Orderly Maps and Trees | url = | journal = Graphs and Combinatorics | volume = 22 | issue = | pages = 185–202 | doi=10.1007/s00373-006-0647-2| citeseerx = 10.1.1.106.7456 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other facts and definitions ==

The [[Four Color Theorem]] states that every planar graph is 4-[[graph coloring|colorable]] (i.e. 4-partite).

[[Fáry's theorem]] states that every simple planar graph admits an embedding in the plane such that all edges are [[straight line]] segments which don't intersect. A [[universal point set]] is a set of points such that every planar graph with ''n'' vertices has such an embedding with all vertices in the point set; there exist universal point sets of quadratic size, formed by taking a rectangular subset of the [[integer lattice]]. Every simple outerplanar graph admits an embedding in the plane such that all vertices lie on a fixed circle and all edges are straight line segments that lie inside the disk and don't intersect, so ''n''-vertex [[regular polygon]]s are universal for outerplanar graphs.

[[Image:dual graphs.svg|thumb|100px|A planar graph and its [[Dual graph|dual]]]]
Given an embedding ''G'' of a (not necessarily simple) connected graph in the plane without edge intersections, we construct the '''[[dual graph]]''' ''G''* as follows: we choose one vertex in each face of ''G'' (including the outer face) and for each edge ''e'' in ''G'' we introduce a new edge in ''G''* connecting the two vertices in ''G''* corresponding to the two faces in ''G'' that meet at ''e''. Furthermore, this edge is drawn so that it crosses ''e'' exactly once and that no other edge of ''G'' or ''G''* is intersected. Then ''G''* is again the embedding of a (not necessarily simple) planar graph; it has as many edges as ''G'', as many vertices as ''G'' has faces and as many faces as ''G'' has vertices. The term "dual" is justified by the fact that ''G''** = ''G''; here the equality is the equivalence of embeddings on the [[sphere]]. If ''G'' is the planar graph corresponding to a convex polyhedron, then ''G''* is the planar graph corresponding to the dual polyhedron.

Duals are useful because many properties of the dual graph are related in simple ways to properties of the original graph, enabling results to be proven about graphs by examining their dual graphs.

While the dual constructed for a particular embedding is unique (up to [[isomorphism]]), graphs may have different (i.e. non-isomorphic) duals, obtained from different (i.e. non-[[homeomorphic]]) embeddings.
   
A ''Euclidean graph'' is a graph in which the vertices represent points in the plane, and the edges are assigned lengths equal to the Euclidean distance between those points; see [[Geometric graph theory]].

A plane graph is said to be ''convex'' if all of its faces (including the outer face) are [[convex polygon]]s. A planar graph may be drawn convexly if and only if it is a [[Subdivision (graph theory)|subdivision]] of a [[k-vertex-connected graph|3-vertex-connected]] planar graph.

[[Scheinerman's conjecture]] (now a theorem) states that every planar graph can be represented as an [[intersection graph]] of [[line segment]]s in the plane.

The [[planar separator theorem]] states that every ''n''-vertex planar graph can be partitioned into two [[Glossary of graph theory#Subgraphs|subgraphs]] of size at most 2''n''/3 by the removal of O({{radic|''n''}}) vertices. As a consequence, planar graphs also have [[treewidth]] and [[branch-width]] O({{radic|''n''}}).

For two planar graphs with ''v'' vertices, it is possible to determine in time O(''v'') whether they are [[graph theory|isomorphic]] or not (see also [[graph isomorphism problem]]).&lt;ref&gt;I. S. Filotti, Jack N. Mayer. A polynomial-time algorithm for determining the isomorphism of graphs of fixed genus. Proceedings of the 12th Annual ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing, p.236&amp;ndash;243. 1980.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[meshedness coefficient]] of a planar graph normalizes its number of bounded faces (the same as the [[circuit rank]] of the graph, by [[Mac Lane's planarity criterion]]) by dividing it by 2''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;5, the maximum possible number of bounded faces in a planar graph with ''n'' vertices. Thus, it ranges from 0 for trees to 1 for maximal planar graphs.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9918">In [[mathematics]], '''signed measure''' is a generalization of the concept of [[measure (mathematics)|measure]] by allowing it to have [[negative and positive numbers|negative]] values. Some authors may call it a '''charge,'''&lt;ref&gt;A charge need not be countably additive: it can be only [[Sigma additivity#Additive (or finitely additive) set functions|finitely additive]]. See reference {{Harvnb|Bhaskara Rao|Bhaskara Rao|1983}} for a comprehensive introduction to the subject.&lt;/ref&gt; by analogy with [[electric charge]], which is a familiar distribution that takes on positive and negative values.

==Definition==
There are two slightly different concepts of a signed measure, depending on whether or not one allows it to take infinite values.  In research papers and advanced books signed measures are usually only allowed to take finite values, while undergraduate textbooks often allow them to take infinite values. To avoid confusion, this article will call these two cases "finite signed measures" and "extended signed measures".

Given a [[measurable space]] (''X'', Σ), that is, a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] ''X'' with a [[sigma algebra]] Σ on it, an '''extended signed measure''' is a [[function (mathematics)|function]]
:&lt;math&gt;\mu:\Sigma\to \mathbb {R}\cup\{\infty,-\infty\}&lt;/math&gt;
such that &lt;math&gt;\mu(\emptyset)=0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \mu &lt;/math&gt; is [[sigma additivity|sigma additive]], that is, it satisfies the equality
:&lt;math&gt; \mu\left(\bigcup_{n=1}^\infty A_n\right) = \sum_{n=1}^\infty \mu(A_n)&lt;/math&gt;
where the series on the right must converge absolutely, for any [[sequence]]  ''A''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''A''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, ... of [[disjoint set]]s in Σ. One consequence is that any extended signed measure can take +∞ as value, or it can take &amp;minus;∞ as value, but both are not available. The expression ∞&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;∞ is undefined &lt;ref&gt;See the article "''[[Extended real number line#Arithmetic operations|Extended real number line]]''" for more information.&lt;/ref&gt; and must be avoided.

A '''finite signed measure''' (aka. '''real measure''') is defined in the same way, except that it is only allowed to take real values. That is, it cannot take +∞ or &amp;minus;∞.

Finite signed measures form a vector space, while extended signed measures are not even closed under addition, which makes them rather hard to work with. On the other hand,  measures are extended signed measures, but are not in general finite signed measures.

==Examples==
Consider a nonnegative measure ν on the space (''X'', Σ) and a [[measurable function]] ''f'':''X''→ '''R''' such that

:&lt;math&gt;\int_X \! |f(x)| \, d\nu (x) &lt; \infty. &lt;/math&gt;

Then, a finite signed measure is given by

:&lt;math&gt;\mu (A) = \int_A \! f(x) \, d\nu (x) &lt;/math&gt;

for all ''A'' in Σ.

This signed measure takes only finite values. To allow it to take +∞ as a value, one needs to replace the assumption about ''f'' being absolutely integrable with the more relaxed condition

:&lt;math&gt;\int_X \! f^-(x) \, d\nu (x) &lt; \infty, &lt;/math&gt;

where ''f''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;&lt;/sup&gt;(''x'') = max(&amp;minus;''f''(''x''), 0) is the [[positive and negative parts|negative part]] of ''f''.

==Properties==

What follows are two results which will imply that an extended signed measure is the difference of two nonnegative measures, and a finite signed measure is the difference of two finite non-negative measures.

The [[Hahn decomposition theorem]] states that given a signed measure μ, there exist two measurable sets ''P'' and ''N'' such that:

#''P''∪''N'' = ''X'' and  ''P''∩''N'' = ∅;
#μ(''E'') ≥ 0 for each ''E'' in Σ such that ''E'' ⊆ ''P'' &amp;mdash; in other words, ''P'' is a [[positive and negative sets|positive set]];
#μ(''E'') ≤ 0 for each ''E'' in Σ such that ''E'' ⊆ ''N'' &amp;mdash; that is, ''N'' is a negative set.
Moreover, this decomposition is unique [[up to]] adding to/subtracting μ-[[null set]]s from ''P'' and ''N''.

Consider then two nonnegative measures μ&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and μ&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; defined by

:&lt;math&gt; \mu^+(E) = \mu(P\cap E)&lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt; \mu^-(E)=-\mu(N\cap E)&lt;/math&gt;

for all measurable sets ''E'', that is, ''E'' in Σ.

One can check that both μ&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and μ&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; are nonnegative measures, with one taking only finite values, and are called the ''positive part'' and ''negative part'' of μ, respectively. One has that μ = μ&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; - μ&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;. The measure  |μ| = μ&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + μ&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; is called the ''variation'' of μ, and its maximum possible value, ||μ|| = |μ|(''X''), is called the ''[[total variation]]'' of μ.

This consequence of the Hahn decomposition theorem is called the ''Jordan decomposition''. The measures μ&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, μ&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; and  |μ| are independent of the choice of ''P'' and ''N'' in the Hahn decomposition theorem.

==The space of signed measures==

The sum of two finite signed measures is a finite signed measure, as is the product of a finite signed measure by a real number: they are closed under [[linear combination]]. It follows that the set of finite signed measures on a measurable space (''X'', Σ) is a real [[vector space]]; this is in contrast to positive measures, which are only closed under [[conical combination]], and thus form a [[convex cone]] but not a vector space. Furthermore, the [[total variation]] defines a [[norm (mathematics)|norm]] in respect to which the space of finite signed measures becomes a [[Banach space]]. This space has even more structure, in that it can be shown to be a [[Dedekind complete]] [[Riesz space|Banach lattice]] and in so doing the [[Radon–Nikodym theorem]] can be shown to be a special case of the [[Freudenthal spectral theorem]].

If ''X'' is a compact separable space, then the space of finite signed Baire measures is the dual of the real Banach space of all continuous real-valued functions on ''X'', by the  [[Riesz–Markov–Kakutani representation theorem]].

In [[mathematics]], a '''subsequence''' is a [[sequence]] that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements. For example, the sequence &lt;math&gt; \langle A,B,D \rangle &lt;/math&gt; is a subsequence of &lt;math&gt; \langle A,B,C,D,E,F \rangle &lt;/math&gt; obtained after removal of elements &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;. The relation of one sequence being the subsequence of another is a [[preorder]].

The subsequence should not be confused with [[substring]] &lt;math&gt; \langle A,B,C,D \rangle &lt;/math&gt; which can be derived from the above [[string (computer science)|string]] &lt;math&gt; \langle A,B,C,D,E,F \rangle &lt;/math&gt; by deleting substring &lt;math&gt; \langle E,F \rangle &lt;/math&gt;. The substring is a refinement of the subsequence. 

The list of all subsequences for the word "'''apple'''" would be "'''a, ap, al, ae, app, apl, ape, ale, appl, appe, aple, apple, p, pp, pl, pe, ppl, ppe, ple, pple, l, le, e'''". 

== Common subsequence ==

Given two sequences ''X'' and ''Y'', a sequence ''Z'' is said to be a ''common subsequence'' of ''X'' and ''Y'', if ''Z'' is a subsequence of both ''X'' and ''Y''.  For example, if

:&lt;math&gt; X = \langle A,C,B,D,E,G,C,E,D,B,G \rangle &lt;/math&gt; and

:&lt;math&gt; Y = \langle B,E,G,C,F,E,U,B,K \rangle &lt;/math&gt;

then a common subsequence of ''X'' and ''Y'' could be

:&lt;math&gt; Z = \langle B,E,E \rangle. &lt;/math&gt;

This would ''not'' be the ''[[Longest-common subsequence problem|longest common subsequence]]'', since ''Z'' only has length 3, and the common subsequence &lt;math&gt; \langle B,E,E,B \rangle &lt;/math&gt; has length&amp;nbsp;4. The longest common subsequence of ''X'' and ''Y'' is &lt;math&gt; \langle B,E,G,C,E,B \rangle &lt;/math&gt;.

==Applications==
Subsequences have applications to [[computer science]],&lt;ref name="substrVsSubseq"&gt;In computer science, ''[[string (computer science)|string]]'' is often used as a synonym for ''sequence'', but it is important to note that ''[[substring]]'' and ''subsequence'' are not synonyms. Substrings are ''consecutive'' parts of a string, while subsequences need not be. This means that a substring of a string is always a subsequence of the string, but a subsequence of a string is not always a substring of the string, see: {{cite book | last = Gusfield | first = Dan | origyear = 1997 | year = 1999 | title = Algorithms on Strings, Trees and Sequences: Computer Science and Computational Biology | publisher = Cambridge University Press | location = USA | isbn = 0-521-58519-8 | pages = 4}}&lt;/ref&gt; especially in the discipline of [[bioinformatics]], where computers are used to compare, analyze, and store [[DNA]], [[RNA]], and [[protein]] sequences.

Take two sequences of DNA containing 37 elements, say:

:&lt;tt&gt;SEQ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = ACGGTGTCGTGCTATGCTGATGCTGACTTATATGCTA&lt;/tt&gt;
:&lt;tt&gt;SEQ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = CGTTCGGCTATCGTACGTTCTATTCTATGATTTCTAA&lt;/tt&gt;

The longest common subsequence of sequences 1 and 2 is:

:&lt;tt&gt;LCS&lt;sub&gt;(SEQ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,SEQ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;/sub&gt; = '''CGTTCGGCTATGCTTCTACTTATTCTA'''&lt;/tt&gt;

This can be illustrated by highlighting the 27 elements of the longest common subsequence into the initial sequences:

:&lt;tt&gt;SEQ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = A'''{{font color|red|CG}}'''G'''{{font color|red|T}}'''G'''{{font color|red|TCG}}'''T'''{{font color|red|GCTATGCT}}'''GA'''{{font color|red|T}}'''G'''{{font color|red|CT}}'''G'''{{font color|red|ACTTAT}}'''A'''{{font color|red|T}}'''G'''{{font color|red|CTA}}'''&lt;/tt&gt;
:&lt;tt&gt;SEQ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = '''{{font color|red|CGTTCGGCTAT}}'''C'''{{font color|red|G}}'''TA'''{{font color|red|C}}'''G'''{{font color|red|TTCTA}}'''TT'''{{font color|red|CT}}'''A'''{{font color|red|T}}'''G'''{{font color|red|ATT}}'''T'''{{font color|red|CTA}}'''A&lt;/tt&gt;

Another way to show this is to ''align'' the two sequences, ''i.e.'', to position elements of the longest common subsequence in a same column (indicated by the vertical bar) and to introduce a special character (here, a dash) in one sequence when two elements in the same column differ:
:&lt;tt&gt;SEQ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = ACGGTGTCGTGCTAT-G--C-TGATGCTGA--CT-T-ATATG-CTA-&lt;/tt&gt;
:&lt;tt&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;|&amp;nbsp;||&amp;nbsp;|||&amp;nbsp;|||||&amp;nbsp;|&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;|&amp;nbsp;|&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;|&amp;nbsp;||&amp;nbsp;|&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;||&amp;nbsp;|&amp;nbsp;||&amp;nbsp;|&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;||| &lt;/tt&gt;
:&lt;tt&gt;SEQ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = -C-GT-TCG-GCTATCGTACGT--T-CT-ATTCTATGAT-T-TCTAA&lt;/tt&gt;

Subsequences are used to determine how similar the two strands of DNA are, using the DNA bases: [[adenine]], [[guanine]], [[cytosine]] and [[thymine]].

== Theorems ==
* Every infinite sequence of real numbers has an infinite [[monotone sequence|monotone]] subsequence (This is a lemma used in the [[Bolzano–Weierstrass theorem#Proof|proof of the Bolzano–Weierstrass theorem]]).
* Every infinite [[bounded sequence]] in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt; has a convergent subsequence (This is the [[Bolzano–Weierstrass theorem]]).
* For all integers ''r'' and ''s'', every finite sequence of length at least (''r''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1)(''s''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1)&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1 contains a monotonically increasing subsequence of length&amp;nbsp;''r'' ''or'' a monotonically decreasing subsequence of length&amp;nbsp;''s'' (This is the [[Erdős–Szekeres theorem]]).

'''Tathagat Avatar Tulsi''' (born 9 September 1987) is an [[India]]n [[physicist]], best known as a [[child prodigy]]. He completed [[high school]] at the age of 9, earned a [[B.Sc.]] at the age of 10 and a [[M.Sc.]] at the age of 12 from [[Patna Science College]] (Patna University). In August 2009, he got his [[Ph.D.]] from the [[Indian Institute of Science]], Bangalore at the age of 22.&lt;ref&gt;[http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/NEWS/City/Bangalore/Youngest-PhD-and-shortest-thesis/articleshow/4952198.cms Youngest PhD and shortest thesis] Times of India&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2010, he was offered a position as Assistant Professor on contract (a non-permanent teaching position for fresh Ph.D. graduates) at [[Indian Institutes of Technology|IIT]] Bombay.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indianexpress.com/news/dr-tathagat-tulsi-22-becomes-professor-tulsi-at-iit-bombay/645689/]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.financialexpress.com/news/Dr-Tathagat-Tulsi--22--becomes-Professor-Tulsi-at-IIT-Bombay/645689/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-07-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100917185542/http://www.financialexpress.com/news/Dr-Tathagat-Tulsi--22--becomes-Professor-Tulsi-at-IIT-Bombay/645689/ |archivedate=2010-09-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.in.msn.com/national/article.aspx?cp-documentid=4149368]&lt;/ref&gt;

While he was admitted for a Ph.D. program at 17, to a journalist query the then dean of the physics dept at IISc described him as a "good boy, very lovable and working to achieve his goals"; however, he declined to comment on the description of Tulsi as a prodigy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/3004502.stm]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
{{BLP sources section|date=January 2018}}

He received wide public attention in 2001, when he was shortlisted by the Indian Government's Department of Science and Technology (DST) to participate in a [[Nobel laureates]] conference in [[Germany]]. Later, the DST officials claimed that it was a mistake to shortlist him, and that he was a "fake prodigy". Tulsi claimed that he had impressed three Nobel laureates but two of them could not recall having talked to him and the third [[Brian Josephson]] did not find anything promising in his ideas.&lt;ref name="gulfnews_broke_kevin"&gt;[http://www.gulfnews.com/world/India/10348151.html I broke Kelvin's Grade 10 record at the age of nine] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090915232957/http://www.gulfnews.com/world/India/10348151.html |date=15 September 2009 }} Gulf News&lt;/ref&gt; Following the controversy, Tulsi is said to have suffered from depression, which he says, cost him a Ph.D. seat at IIT. He decided to "fight back" by earning a Ph.D. and gaining recognition as a scientist.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}

Tulsi was admitted by the [[Indian Institute of Science]] (IISc).,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indianexpress.com/res/web/pIe/full_story.php?content_id=16345 Prodigy Tulsi seals debate with PhD admission in IISc] Indian Express&lt;/ref&gt; where he wrote a 33-page long Ph.D. thesis on "Generalizations of the Quantum Search Algorithm". He has the special distinction of being one of the world's youngest scientists. At the age of 17, he co-authored a research manuscript ("A New Algorithm for Fixed-point Quantum Search") with [[Lov Grover]], the inventor of a quantum search algorithm that goes by his name.

Tulsi is listed as one of the most gifted Asian youngsters by ''[[Time (magazine)|TIME]]'' magazine, mentioned as "Superteen" by ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'', "Physics Prodigy" by ''The TIMES'', "Master Mind" by ''The WEEK'' and listed by ''[[Outlook (magazine)|Outlook]]'' as one of the smartest Indian youngsters. Tathagat Avatar Tulsi participated in the [[Stock Exchange of Visions]] project of Fabrica, [[Benetton Group|Benetton]]'s research centre in 2007.  He was invited by [[Luciano Benetton]] for a dinner in honor of [[Al Gore]] on 14 June 2007 in Milano, Italy. Tathagat's story was showcased by [[National Geographic Channel]] in the program ''[[My Brilliant Brain]]''. The episode named "India's Geniuses" was aired on 13 December 2007 and was hosted by Bollywood actress [[Konkona Sen Sharma]]. He was interviewed by 14-year-old Trishit Banerjee for his magazine ''Young Chronicle''.

'''Technical drawing tools''' include and are not limited to: pens, rulers, compasses, protractors and drawing utilities. Drafting tools may be used for measurement and layout of drawings, or to improve the consistency and speed of creation of standard drawing elements. The tools used for manual [[technical drawing]] have been displaced by the advent of the personal computer and its common utilization as the main tool in computer-aided drawing, draughting and design ([[CADD]]).

== History ==
The ancient Egyptians are known to have used wooden corner rulers.&lt;ref name="Hand tool"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/254115/hand-tool|title=Hand tool|year=2009|work=Encyclopædia Britannica Online|publisher=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]|accessdate=2009-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ancient [[Nuragic civilization|Nuragic people]] in [[Sardinia]] used [[compasses]] made of bronze, like the one displayed in showcase 25 in the Nuragic department of the National Archeological Museum G. A. Sanna in [[Sassari]]. In ancient Greece, evidence has been found of the use of styli and metal chisels, scale rulers and triangle rulers. Excavations in Pompeii have found a bronze tool kit used by the Romans, which contained triangle rulers, [[Compass (drafting)|compasses]] and a ruler to use with a pen.&lt;ref name="Higgott"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Higgott|first=Gordon|date=March 1990|title=Review: Drawing Instruments, 1580-1980 by Maya Hambly|journal=The Journal of the Society of Architectural Historians|publisher=The [[Society of Architectural Historians]]|volume=49|issue=1|pages=111–112|doi=
10.2307/990507 |jstor=990507}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although a variety of styli were developed in ancient times and were still being used in the 18th century, [[quill]]s were generally used as the main drawing tool. Styli were also used in the form of [[ivory]] or [[ebony]] pencils.&lt;ref name="Higgott"/&gt;

[[Protractor]]s have been used to measure and draw angles and arcs of a circle accurately since about the 13th century,&lt;ref name="protractor"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/480521/protractor|title=Hand tool|year=2009|work=Encyclopædia Britannica Online|publisher=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]|accessdate=2009-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; although mathematics and science demanded more detailed drawing instruments. The adjustable corner ruler was developed in the 17th century, but a feasible screw-tightened version not until the 1920s.&lt;ref name="Higgott"/&gt;

[[File:Holding-a-ruling-pen.jpg|150px|thumb|Holding a ruling-pen, 1901]]

In the 17th century, a stylus that could draw a line with a specific width called a [[ruling pen]] was developed. The stylus had two curved metal pieces which were joined by a screw. Ink was trickled between the blades, from which it flowed evenly across the paper. The basic model was maintained for a long time, with minor modifications, until the 1930s when the German technical drawing pens came to the market.&lt;ref name="Higgott"/&gt;

Artists (including [[Leonardo da Vinci]] and [[Albrecht Dürer]], [[Nicholas Bion]] and George Adams) generally made drawing tools for themselves.&lt;ref name="Hand tool"/&gt; Industrial production of technical drawing instruments started in 1853, when Englishman [[William Stanley (inventor)|William Stanley]] (1829–1909) founded a technical manufacturing company in London. Even then, however, most tools were still made by hand.&lt;ref name="Higgott"/&gt;

In the 1930s the equipment available expanded: drawing apparatus and [[Technical pen|Rapidograph]]-drawing pens appeared, improving the line quality and, especially, producing consistent line width.&lt;ref name="Higgott"/&gt; In addition to the Rapidograph stylus, a more traditional Grafos-type stylus was used for a long time, where different line widths were achieved by changing the pen nib. For instance in Finland Grafos was commonly used as a primary drawing tool still in the early 1970s.

Equipment changed radically during the 1990s, when [[computer-aided design]] almost completely ousted drawing by hand. Technical design has changed from drawing by hand to producing computer-aided design drawings, where drawings are no longer "drawn", but are built from a virtually-produced model. Drawings are not necessarily produced in hard copy at all, and if they are needed they are printed automatically by a computer program. Hand-drawn designs, however, are still widely used in the draft design stage.

== Drawing tools ==

=== Pencil===

Traditional and typical styli used for technical drawing are [[pencil]]s and [[technical pen]]s.

[[File:Dotted Line Tool from the 1930s.webm|thumb|Video of a 1930s dotted-line drawing pen]]

Pencils in use are usually [[mechanical pencil]]s with a standard lead thickness. The usual line widths are 0.18&amp;nbsp;mm, 0.25&amp;nbsp;mm, 0.5&amp;nbsp;mm and 0.7&amp;nbsp;mm. Hardness varies usually from HB to 2H. Softer lead gives a better contrast, but harder lead gives a more accurate line. Bad contrast of the lead line in general is problematic when photocopying, but new scanning copy techniques have improved the final result. Paper or plastic surfaces require their own lead types.

[[File:Architect.png|250px|thumb|A parallel ruler-equipped drawing board. Drawing from an article published in a Norwegian technical journal ''Teknisk Ukeblad'' in 1893. The article dealt with a new kind of vertical drawing apparatus. The board was equipped with a lift mechanism, improving the ergonomy when doing large drawings.]]

In most cases, the final drawings are drawn with ink, on either plastic or [[tracing paper]]. The pen is generally a [[Rapidograph]]-type technical pen, a marker pen that draws lines of consistent width (so-called steel marker pen). The pen has an ink container which contains a metal tube, inside which is a thin metal needle or wire, the soul. Ink is absorbed between the needle and the tube wall, preventing an excessive amount of ink from being released. The needle has a weight and by waving the pen back and forth the needle is released and the ink can run. Originally, the tank was filled from an ink bottle; newer pens use ink cartridges.

Each line width has its own stylus. The line width is [[Standardization|standardized]]: In Finland, the most commonly used set is 0.13&amp;nbsp;mm, 0.18&amp;nbsp;mm, 0.25&amp;nbsp;mm, 0.35&amp;nbsp;mm, 0.50&amp;nbsp;mm and 0.70&amp;nbsp;mm. Separate styli are used for tracing paper and plastic, because plastic requires a harder pen tip. To function well they require regular maintenance, the finest marker pens in particular.

=== Drafting board ===

The [[drawing board]] is an essential tool. Paper will be attached and kept straight and still, so that the drawing can be done with accuracy. Generally, different kind of assistance rulers are used in drawing. The drawing board is usually mounted to a floor pedestal in which the board turns to a different position, and also its height can be adjustable. Smaller drawing boards are produced for table-top use. In the 18th and 19th centuries,drawing paper was dampened and then its edges glued to the drawing board. After drying the paper would be flat and smooth. The completed drawing was then cut free.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=4b4LAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA2&amp;dq=Mathematical+instruments+glue&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=dLGiT_SeIoWw8ATJsKX9CA&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Mathematical%20instruments%20glue&amp;f=false]  John Fry Heather ''Mathematical instruments: their construction, adjustment, testing, and use, comprising drawing, measuring, optical, surveying, and astronomical instruments'' (Crosby, Lockwood and co., 1884) pages 1-2&lt;/ref&gt; Paper could also be secured to the drawing board with [[drawing pin]]s &lt;ref&gt;''The American engineer'' Volumes 19-20, 1890 page 107&lt;/ref&gt; or even [[C-clamp]]s. More recent practice is to use self-adhesive tape to secure paper to the board, including the sophisticated use of individualized adhesive dots from a dispensing roll. Some drawing boards are magnetized, allowing paper to be held down by long steel strips. Boards used for overlay drafting or [[Traditional animation|animation]] may include [[registration pin]]s or peg bars to ensure alignment of multiple layers of drawing media.

===T-square===
A [[T-square]] is a [[straightedge]] which uses the edge of the drawing board as a support. It is used with the drafting board to draw horizontal lines and to align other drawing instruments. Wooden, metal, or plastic triangles with 30° and 60° angles or with two 45° angles are used to speed drawing of lines at these commonly used angles.  A continuously adjustable 0–90° [[protractor]] is also in use. An alternative to the T-square is the [[parallel bar]] which is permanently attached to the drawing board. It has a set of cables and pulleys to allow it to be positioned anywhere on the drawing surface while still remaining parallel to the bottom of the board.  The drafting machine replaces the T-square and triangles.

=== Drafting machine ===
[[File:Zeichenmaschine.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Right-handed parallelogram machine with a ballast.]]

A [[drafting machine]] is a device which is mounted to the drawing board. It has rulers whose angles can be precisely adjusted with a controlling mechanism.
&lt;ref name="MOT"&gt;{{cite book|title=Language of the Office dictionary|publisher=Indigenous languages and the Language Research Center of Machinery Ltd|year=2004|edition=Web Version 1.0|isbn=952-5446-11-5|language=Finnish}}&lt;/ref&gt;
There are two main types of apparatus: an arm-type parallelogram apparatus based on a hinged arm; and a track-type apparatus which moves on a rail mounted to the top of the drawing board. The accuracy of the arm type apparatus is better in the middle of the board, decreasing towards the edges, whereas a track machine has a constant accuracy over the whole board. The drawing head of a track-type drafting machine slides on bearings in a vertical rail, which in turn is moved along a horizontal, top-mounted rail. Both apparatus types have an adjustable drawing-head with rules attached to a protractor scale so that the angle of the rules may be adjusted.&lt;ref&gt;Alan Jefferis, David A. Madsen ''Architectural Drafting and Design'' (Cengage Learning, 2004) 
{{ISBN|1-4018-6715-4}}, pages 35-36&lt;/ref&gt;

A drafting machine allows easy drawing of parallel lines over the paper. The adjustable angle between the rulers allows the lines to be drawn in varying accurate angles. Rulers may also be used as a support for separate special rulers and letter templates. The rules are replaceable and they can be for example scale-rules.

Drawing apparatus has evolved from a drawing board mounted parallel ruler and a [[pantograph]], which is a device used for copying objects in an adjustable ratio of sizes.

===French Curves===

[[French curve]]s are made of wood, plastic or celluloid. Some set squares also have these curves cut in the middle. French curves are used for drawing curves which cannot be drawn with compasses. A faint freehand curve is first drawn through the known points; the longest possible curve that coincides exactly with the freehand curve is then found out from the French curves. Finally, a neat continuous curve is drawn with the aid of the French curves.&lt;ref&gt;N.D.Bhatt ''Engineering Drawing Plane and Solid Geometry'' (Charotar Publishing House, 2012), pages 12-13&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rulers===
{{Main|Scale ruler}}

[[Ruler]]s used in technical drawing are usually made of [[polystyrene]].It is used for drawing lines and connecting points. Rulers come in two types according to the design of their edge. A ruler with a straight edge can be used with lead pencils and felt pens, whereas when a [[technical pen]] is used the edge must be grooved to prevent the spread of the ink.

[[File:Architectural scale.jpg|thumb|150px|left|An architect's scale]]

A [[scale ruler]] is a scaled, three-edged ruler which has six different scales marked to its sides. A typical combination for building details&lt;!--rakennusdetaljointi--&gt; is 1:20, 1:50, 1:100, 1:25, 1:75 and 1:125. There are separate rulers for zoning work as well as for inch units. Today scale rulers are made of plastic, formerly they were made of [[hardwood]]. A pocket-sized version is also available, with scales printed on flexible plastic strips.

[[File:Drafting table.jpg|thumb|350px|right|View of a drafting table: the old way of producing architectural and engineering drawings. On the top of the board is a paraller ruler.]]

[[File:Lineale.jpg|thumb|350px|Rulers and templates]]
[[File:L-Zeichnen2.png|thumb|150px|Various curved rulers, commonly known as [[French curve]]s. This image comes from the Lexikon der gesamten Technik (dictionary of technology) from 1904 by Otto Lueger]]

===Compass===
[[Compass (drafting)|Compasses]] are used for drawing circles or arc segments of circles. One form has two straight legs joined by a hinge; one leg has a sharp pivot point and the other has a holder for a [[technical pen]] or pencil. Another form, the beam compass, has the pivot point and pen holder joined by a trammel bar, useful when drawing very large radius arcs. Often a circle template is used instead of a compass when predefined circle sizes are required.

=== Templates ===

Templates contain pre-dimensioned holes in the right scale to accurately draw a symbol or sign.

Letter templates are used for drawing text, including digits and letter characters. Diagrams are usually of a standard letter shape and size to conform to standards of encodings (e.g. DIN or ANSI). For example, in Finland the series used is 1.8&amp;nbsp;mm, 2.5&amp;nbsp;mm, 3.5&amp;nbsp;mm, 5.0&amp;nbsp;mm and 7.0&amp;nbsp;mm. Except for the very biggest ones, the templates are only suitable for technical pen drawing.

For drawing circles and circle-arcs, circle templates which contain a set of suitably-sized holes are used. Templates are also available for other geometric shapes such as squares and for drawing ellipses, as well as many specialized varieties for other purposes.

There are also specific templates to provide user with the most common symbols in use in different branches of designing.
&lt;!--like architecture, engine design etc. someone could formulate this better--&gt;
For example, the architect templates can be used to draw different sized doors with their "opening arcs",
&lt;!--the arc describing an opening door--&gt;
building and equipment symbols and furniture. The templates also provide the symbols for thermal insulation.

Two methods of drawing smooth curves in manual drafting are the use of [[French curve]]s and [[flat spline]]s (flexible curves). A French curve is a drawing aid with many different smoothly-varying radiused curves on it; the manual drafter can fit the French curve to some known reference points and draw a smooth curved line between them. A spline is a flexible ruler, usually rubber or plastic coated with a metal "backbone", which can be smoothly shaped to follow a desired curve and allows drawing a smooth line between initial reference points. Sometimes a spline is temporarily held in position with small weights.

=== Perspective machines ===
{{main|Perspective machine}}
A perspective machine is an instrument designed to create [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]] drawings.&lt;ref&gt;"Perspective Machine", ''The New and Complete American Encyclopedia'', [[John Low]], 1810, p. 441&lt;/ref&gt;

== Drawing materials ==

=== Drafting paper ===
Silk-paper -like translucent drafting paper that wrinkles when wetted. It is primarily suitable for pencils and felt tip pens. Pencil marks can be corrected to some extent with an eraser.

=== Thick draft paper ===
Sandwich paper -like, thin translucent sheet of paper.
&lt;!--left out Finnish names for this paper: skissi, teräs(steel-)skissi, and puolikuulto (half-translucent)--&gt;
Manufactured in different strengths, the surface may be slightly polished. This paper also wrinkles upon wetting. Suitable for pencil and felt tipped pens, and with limitations for technical pens. An eraser can be used for pencil lines. Ink is difficult to erase without damage.

===Cloth===
[[Drafting linen]] was formerly used for technical drawings. It was durable and held up to handling, but it was difficult to use in modern [[whiteprint]]s for reproduction, and shrinking was a concern.

=== Tracing paper ===
{{see also|Vellum}}

Polished sandwich paper -like, translucent thick paper, which comes in different strengths. Wrinkles upon wetting. Suitable for both graphite pencils and technical pens. An eraser or sharp scraper tool is used for corrections.

===Tracing tube ===
Translucent plastic film, which is usually of gray or a light khaki shade. Common types are 0.05, 0.07 and 0.10&amp;nbsp;mm thick. These films are also used in [[Photocopier|photocopying]]. The most commonly used materials are [[polyester]]s, and sometimes also [[PVC]] or [[polycarbonate]]; arguably, a proprietary eponym or genericized trademark for this is called [[BoPET|Mylar]].

In drawing, plastic's specific advantages over translucent paper are higher mechanical strength and dimensional accuracy; plastic does not, unlike paper, shrink or stretch with changing air humidity. Plastic is also as a surface completely flat, while the surface of paper is relatively rough. Plastic is suitable for both pencils and drawing pens&lt;!--taas tuo tussikynä--&gt;. However, the surface tends to wear the pen tips, which must be made of hard-metal alloy. Ordinary ink is not absorbed into the plastic at all, so the lines can easily be removed with an eraser. Photocopier marks can be removed by scraping.

===Inks===
Drawing inks can be divided into two groups: [[India ink]] and polymer inks. India ink is used on paper and drafting film plastics. The most commonly used India ink is a [[colloidal]] mixture of water and [[carbon black]].

===Dry transfer===
[[Dry transfer]] decals can speed the production of repetitive drawing elements such as borders, title blocks, line types, shading, and symbols.  They were frequently used in the production of schematic drawings, maps, and [[printed circuit board]] artwork, for example. Dry transfer lettering such as [[Letraset]] was used especially in lettering larger size document annotations, or when consistency of lettering was especially required.

==Reproduction==
{{main|Reprography}}
Many copies of technical drawings may be required in the construction of a project. Reproductions must be accurate as to size and shape, but for many purposes need not be permanent. The [[blueprint]] process was first used for mechanical reproduction of drawings. Drawing offices may use [[diazo]] or [[whiteprint]] processes.  Where the volume of drawings reproduced justifies the cost of the machine, a large format photocopier using [[xerography]] can reproduce drawings at lower cost than re-plotting them.

'''Yael Naim Dowker''' (1919–2016)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Women At Imperial College; Past, Present And Future|last=Barrett|first=Anne|publisher=World Scientific|year=2017|isbn=9781786342645|page=303|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OPutDgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA303}}&lt;/ref&gt; was an [[Israel]]i-[[English people|English]] [[mathematician]], prominent especially due to her work in the fields of [[Measure (mathematics)|measure theory]], [[ergodic theory]] and [[topological dynamics]].

==Biography==
Yael Naim (later Dowker) was born in [[Tel Aviv]]. She left for the United States to study at [[Johns Hopkins University]] in [[Baltimore]], [[Maryland]]. In 1941, as a graduate student, she met [[Clifford Hugh Dowker]], a [[Canada|Canadian]] [[Topology|topologist]] working as an instructor there. The couple married in 1944. From 1943 to  1946 they worked together at the [[Radiation Laboratory (MIT)|Radiation Laboratory]] at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]]. Clifford also worked as a civilian adviser for the [[United States Air Force]] during [[World War II]].&lt;ref name="JamesKronheimer1985"&gt;{{cite book|last1=James|first1=I. M.|last2=Kronheimer|first2=E. H.|title=Aspects of Topology: In Memory of Hugh Dowker 1912–1982|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ms9uRvYl4pAC&amp;pg=PR11|date=31 January 1985|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-27815-7|pages=11–12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dowker did her doctorate at [[Radcliffe College]] (in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]]) under [[Witold Hurewicz]] (a [[Poland|Polish]] mathematician known for the [[Hurewicz theorem]]). She published her thesis ''Invariant measure and the ergodic theorems'' in 1947 and received her Ph.D in 1948.&lt;ref name="MathematicsGenealogyProject"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.genealogy.math.ndsu.nodak.edu/id.php?id=35131 |title=Yael Dowker |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |website=[[Mathematics Genealogy Project]] |access-date=14 October 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In the period between 1948 and 1949, she did post-doctoral work at the [[Institute for Advanced Study]], located in [[Princeton, New Jersey]]. A few years after the war, [[McCarthyism]] became a common phenomenon in the academic world, with several of the Dowker couple's friends in the mathematical community harassed and one arrested. In 1950, they emigrated to the [[United Kingdom]].&lt;ref name="JamesKronheimer1985"/&gt;

In 1951 Dowker served as a professor at the [[Victoria University of Manchester|University of Manchester]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society |publisher=American Mathematical Society |date=1951 |page=100 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and later went on as a professor at the [[Imperial College London]]. 
While there, among the students she advised was [[Bill Parry (mathematician)|Bill Parry]], who published his thesis in 1960.&lt;ref name="MathematicsGenealogyProject"/&gt; She also cooperated on some of her work with the [[Hungary|Hungarian]] mathematician [[Paul Erdős]] (Erdős' number of one). With her husband, she helped educate over thirty "gifted children".&lt;ref name="JamesKronheimer1985"/&gt;
