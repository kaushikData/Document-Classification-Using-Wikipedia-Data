The '''2011 Djiboutian protests''' were widespread demonstrations and riots that took place between January and March 2011 in [[Djibouti]], situated in the [[Horn of Africa]]. A member of the [[Arab League]], the protests in Djibouti showed a clear [[Impact of the Arab Spring|influence]] from the concurrent [[Arab Spring]] protests in [[North Africa]] and the [[Arabian peninsula]]. The demonstrations ended after mass arrests&lt;ref name=afrol/&gt; and the barring of international observers.&lt;ref name=msnbc/&gt;&lt;ref name=arf/&gt;

==Background==
President of Djibouti [[Ismail Omar Guelleh]] has been in office since 1999, but his government has been in power for 34 years. Recently, Guelleh changed the constitution so that he could have a third term in office. This proved unpopular with the Djiboutian population.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;[http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2011/mar/06/af-djibouti-protests/ Police, army forces in Djibouti prevent protest - Sunday, March 6, 2011 | 3:02 a.m. - Las Vegas Sun&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]{{dead link|date=July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These protests occurred in the months leading up to the [[Djiboutian presidential election, 2011]].

==Protests==

===Before February 19===
On January 25, thousands of people turned out to protest in Djibouti City. Similar to the events on January 28, only smaller. 300 people gathered in a square in the capital, [[Djibouti (city)|Djibouti]]. On February 18, thousands rallied against the president, gathering at a stadium with the intention of staying there until their demands were met. However, the demonstration escalated into clashes after dusk, as police used batons and tear gas against stone-throwing protesters. Officials from the Union for Democratic Change, an umbrella group of three opposition parties, gave speeches at the demonstration calling for Guelleh to step down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Djiboutians rally to oust president|author =|publisher=[[Aljazeera English]]|date=18 February 2011|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/africa/2011/02/201121816513686216.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Leaders of the United Sun Nations, opposition parties and protest organisers were set to meet on February 24 to plan mass protests for the following day. Police acting on behalf of Gulleh arrested 300 organisers during and after the mass protests on February 18, with reports of torture being used to sedate the activists. After the failure of the leaders to turn up on February 24, opposition leader [[Bourhan Mohammed Ali]] stated he feared the protests had lost momentum.&lt;ref name="afrol"&gt;[http://www.afrol.com/articles/37449 afrol News - Mass arrests stopped further Djibouti protests&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Protests had been planned for March 4, but it remained to be seen if the Djiboutians would be able to coordinate themselves without the 300 arrested leaders.&lt;ref name="afrol" /&gt;

The '''60th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of [[China]]''' took place on 1 October 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/60th/index.html |title=60th Anniversary of the People's Republic of China |work=China Daily }}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[military parade]] involving 10,000 troops and the display of many high-tech weapons was held in [[Tiananmen Square]] in [[Beijing]] and various celebrations were conducted all over the country. [[Hu Jintao]] inspected the troops along [[Chang'an Avenue]] in Beijing. This parade was immediately followed by a civilian parade involving 100,000 participants.

==Background==
[[Image:Tiananmengatepic1.jpg|thumb|250px|The 60th Anniversary Military Parade took place on [[Chang'an Avenue]], beneath [[Tiananmen]].]]
The People's Republic of China was founded on 1 October 1949. Since then, celebrations of varying scales occur on [[National Day of the People's Republic of China|National Day]] each year. [[Military parade]]s, presided over by Chairman [[Mao Zedong]], were held every year between 1949 and 1959. In September 1960, the Chinese leadership decided that in order to save funds and "be frugal", large-scale ceremonies for National Day would only be held every ten years, with a smaller-scale ceremony every five years.&lt;ref name=Wei&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mil.eastday.com/eastday/mil/node3043/node33436/userobject1ai542876.html |title=Wei Jianfeng: Looking back at 13 military parades since the founding of the PRC |language=Chinese |work=東方軍事 (Eastday) |access-date=16 September 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090926125224/http://mil.eastday.com/eastday/mil/node3043/node33436/userobject1ai542876.html |archive-date=26 September 2009 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The last large-scale celebration during the Mao era was in 1969. Large-scale celebrations did not take place for 14 years amidst the climax of the [[Cultural Revolution]].&lt;ref name=Wei/&gt; Since then, the most prominent National Day celebrations have taken place in 1984 and 1999, at the 35th and 50th anniversaries respectively. During these celebrations, then-[[paramount leader]] [[Deng Xiaoping]] and [[Jiang Zemin]] reviewed military parades of the [[People's Liberation Army]]. The 2009 parade was the first and last time [[Hu Jintao]] oversaw this task, as he left office in 2012 due to term limits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,26150813-25837,00.html | work=The Australian | first=Michael | last=Sainsbury | title=China marks 60th anniversary of communist rule | date=1 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

40&amp;nbsp;million potted flowers, supplied by the state-owned Beijing Flowers &amp; Trees Corp., were put in place in Beijing streets, approximately 5&amp;nbsp;million of which have been planted along the east-west axis of [[Chang'an Avenue]], also known as 'Avenue of Eternal Peace'. Flowers in Tiananmen Square were under 24-hour surveillance; Beijing Jinggong Red Flag factory is producing 2&amp;nbsp;million national flags for the celebrations.&lt;ref name=sina20090915&gt;{{cite news |url=http://english.sina.com/china/p/2009/0914/270586.html |title=Flowers decorate streets of Beijing |date=15 September 2009 |author=China Daily |work=[[Sina.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Tiananmen Square itself, 56 "pillars of national unity" – each one symbolizing the [[List of ethnic groups in China|56 ethnic groups in China]] – were erected, with each containing fireworks for the night event on 1 October.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2009-09/15/content_8693109.htm | title='Pillars of National Unity' set up in Tian'anmen Square |work=China Daily  | date=15 September 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 800,000 volunteers controlled crowds and maintained order while a further 30,000 provided translation services at subway and bus stations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.straitstimes.com/Breaking%2BNews/Asia/Story/STIStory_434642.html |title=Excitement over China's N-Day |date=26 September 2009 |author=Ng, Grace |work=[[The Straits Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mosquitoes, rats, flies, and cockroaches were the targets of professional exterminators – four unannounced night-time sweeps were carried out around [[Tiananmen Square]] in Beijing, including in the [[Forbidden City]] complex. The public was encouraged to support the eradication through red slogan banners along Beijing streets and alleys, in what ''The Times'' said was reminiscent of the [[Great sparrow campaign|Four Pests campaign]]. One of these slogans read: “Eradicate the four pests, stress hygiene. Cleanly, cleanly welcome National Day!”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=3 September 2009 |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/asia/article6819291.ece |title=China wages war on pests before 60th anniversary of Communist rule |first=Jane |last=Macartney |work=The Times | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tiananmen Square was sealed off for the day on 29 August for the first rehearsals. Tens of thousands of fully costumed performers rehearsed on 16 September.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://english.sina.com/china/p/2009/0916/271083.html |title=Rehearsal for National Day celebration held in Beijing |date=17 September 2009 |author=Xinhua |work=Sina.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The military also prepared, with several hundred vehicles rolling down Chang'an Avenue on 6 September.&lt;ref name=straits090906&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.straitstimes.com/Breaking%2BNews/Asia/Story/STIStory_426284.html |title=60th anniversary rehearsal |date=6 September 2009 |author=AP |work=[[The Straits Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; parts of Beijing were closed down on 18 September for the final rehearsals of the anniversary parade. Police cleared streets and office buildings on the main roadways near Tiananmen Square from noon onwards for rehearsals that evening. State media went into overdrive, for example, highlighting how thousands of troops spent four months drilling to march in step on a mock practice ground with scale model of Chang'an Avenue - complete with the leadership reviewing stand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5gvlZSXX-y0QT5V6gSSabSp9SiYpwD9APQCJO2 |title=Dry run: Beijing shuts early for parade practice |first=Charles |last=Hutzler |work=[[Associated Press]] |date=19 September 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Following disruptions caused by the drills, which shut down roads and large parts of the [[Beijing Subway]], ''[[Xinhua News Agency]]'' announced that the final rehearsal parade, scheduled for 26 September, was called off.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idUSTRE58I07U20090919 |work=Reuters |title=Beijing cancels National Day rehearsal after disruptions |date=18 September 2009 | first=Ben | last=Blanchard}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other security arrangements in place included relocation of mailboxes and newspaper stands along [[Chang'an Avenue]] and the closure or restricted opening of some of the hotels along the route (ex. the [[Beijing Hotel]], the [[Beijing News Plaza Hotel]], and the [[Beijing International Hotel]]). Other hotels on Chang'an Avenue closed guest rooms facing the main road during the celebrations.&lt;ref name=sina20090915/&gt;

==Media==
The government established a media centre from 22 September until 2 October at the [[Media Center Hotel]] catering for journalists covering celebrations. The centre's deputy, Zhu Shouchen, said they received applications from more than 4,500 journalists around the world, including some 1,300 journalists from 346 media organisations in 108 countries. Almost 400 of them were said to be from Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan.&lt;ref name=mediacent&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2009-09/22/content_12096071.htm |title=China opens media center for coverage of 60th National Day celebrations | work=Chinaviwew |author=Xinhua |date=22 September 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A film entitled ''[[The Founding of a Republic]]'', commissioned by China's film regulator and made by the [[China Film Group]] (CFG) to mark the anniversary, was released nationwide on 17 September. The film retells the tale of the Communist ascendancy and triumph, with a star-studded cast including [[Zhang Ziyi]], [[Jackie Chan]], [[Jet Li]], and directors [[Jiang Wen]], [[Chen Kaige]] and [[John Woo]] in mostly cameos appearances; the leading roles – such as [[Mao Zedong]] – were played by lesser known actors. CFG chairman [[Han Sanping]] co-directed the film with [[Huang Jianxin]]. A CFG spokesman said many stars answered Han's call to appear in the film and waived their fee, helping it keep its modest budget of 60–70&amp;nbsp;million yuan (US$8.8–$10&amp;nbsp;million). According to the executive at one of China's top multiplex chains, the film unusually married "the core of an 'ethically inspiring' film" – code for propaganda films, according to the Associated Press – "with commercial packaging."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5jC9FHUhmam1K9PqXuyaKZDnjzH3AD9AFNKOO0 |title=China injects star power into anniversary film |first=Min |last=Lee |agency=AP |date=3 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Leaders===
[[Liu Qi (politician)|Liu Qi]], as the Beijing municipal Communist Party [[CPC party chief|Secretary]], was the [[master of ceremonies]] for the event. [[Hu Jintao]], in his position as the General Secretary of the Communist Party, President of the People's Republic, and Chairman of the Central Military Commission, presided over the military parade. In addition, all members of the [[Politburo Standing Committee]] at the time, along with the former General Secretary, President [[Jiang Zemin]], stood atop [[Tiananmen]] in [[Political position ranking of the People's Republic of China|protocol order]] for the entire duration of the parade.

===Military parade===
The military parade took place on [[Chang'an Avenue]], with the country's leaders watching the parade from [[Tiananmen]], above Mao's portrait. Hu Jintao inspected the troops standing onto a [[FAW Hongqi|Hongqi]] [[Hongqi HQE|HQE]] limousine designed for the event, with a special license plate ('''[[Vehicle registration plates of China#Beijing|&lt;span style="color:red;"&gt;京V&lt;/span&gt;]] 02009'''). For the anniversary, the Chinese government budgeted roughly $44&amp;nbsp;million for the military parade, with some budget cuts due to the recent global financial crisis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://en.rian.ru/world/20090130/119888198.html |title=China to hold frugal 60th anniversary parade |date=30 January 2009 |work=[[RIA Novosti]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The parade displayed 52 new types of military hardware, including [[Type 99 tank|ZTZ99]] main battle tanks, [[Chengdu J-10|J-10]] fighter aircraft, [[Shaanxi Y-8|KJ-200]] and [[KJ-2000]] [[Airborne early warning and control|early-warning aircraft]], [[Harbin Z-9|Z-9W]] [[attack helicopter]]s, and new models of the [[QBZ-95|Type 95]] and [[QBZ-03|Type 03]] [[assault rifle]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://english.people.com.cn/90001/90776/90882/6765794.html | title=Six Most Anticipated 'New Weapons' in the National Day Parade|work=People's Daily | date=23 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:China at 60 1kg gold coin.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Front and back of a limited edition (100) one-kilogram gold commemorative coin with a face value of 10,000 yuan.]]Three types of gold coins and two types of silver coins were issued by the [[People's Bank of China]] on 16 September to commemorate the anniversary. A total of 60,700 gold coins with [[face value]]s of [[Chinese yuan|¥]]10,000, 2,000 yuan, and 100 yuan were issued, while a total of 106,000 silver coins with the face values of 300 and 10 yuan issued. All the coins, produced by [[Shenzhen Guobao Mint]] and [[Shenyang Mint]], and distributed by the China Gold Coin Incorporation, are legal tender.&lt;ref name=coins&gt;{{cite news |url=http://english.people.com.cn/90001/90778/90857/90859/6746691.html |title=Central Bank to issue coins commemorating 60th anniversary of founding of New China | work=People's Daily |author=Xinhua |date=2 September 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The obverse of the coins features China's national emblem, set in a frieze of peonies. The reverse includes various designs including a rocket, a satellite, a high-speed train, and the Beijing Olympic Stadium. Other forms will show designs of an open gate, a bridge, or urban construction.

On 20 October 2009, the [[China National Philatelic Corporation]] issued three collections in commemoration of the 60th Anniversary.

Their pictorial design is based on the winning entries of a competition: [[Victoria Harbour]] and Tiananmen Square are depicted on two interlocking cogwheels on the $1.40 stamp; the five-star national flag flying by the side of the "Forever Blooming Bauhinia" ($1.80). The [[Beijing National Stadium|Bird's Nest stadium]] is on the $2.40, while China's manned spacecraft [[Shenzhou 7]] is depicted on the $2.50. The [[Temple of Heaven]] features on the $3 value and a golden dragon soaring above the [[Great Wall of China|Great Wall]] adorns the $5 stamp. A souvenir sheet features all six stamps, which form a perfect ring with the accompanying number "6", together forming the number "60". Hong Kong's stamp sheetlet has two $5 stamps in Chinese red, one featuring Beijing and one [[Victoria, Hong Kong|Victoria]]. The National Emblem and [[Tiananmen]] appear on the left and the Regional Emblem above a night view of Hong Kong.&lt;ref name=HKstamps/&gt;

'''All In''' (stylized as '''ALL IN''') was an [[independent circuit|independent]] [[professional wrestling]] [[pay-per-view]] (PPV) event promoted by [[Cody Rhodes]] and [[The Young Bucks]] (Matt and Nick Jackson) from the [[Bullet Club]]. It took place on September 1, 2018 at the [[Sears Centre]] in the [[Chicago metropolitan area|Chicago suburb]] of [[Hoffman Estates, Illinois]]. The event aired live on traditional PPV outlets, Fite TV, and [[Honor Club]], and was later made available for on demand viewing on the [[New Japan Pro-Wrestling World|NJPW World]] streaming service.&lt;ref name="NJPWWB"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://twitter.com/njpwglobal/status/1034615524812972033 |title=njpw global on Twitter |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The event included ''Zero Hour'', an hour long pre-show that aired on [[WGN America]]. The event – while independently produced – featured wrestlers from [[Ring of Honor]] (ROH), [[Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre]] (CMLL), [[New Japan Pro-Wrestling]] (NJPW), [[Impact Wrestling]], [[Lucha Libre AAA Worldwide]] (AAA), and the [[National Wrestling Alliance]] (NWA).

The event had eleven matches, with two being on the pre-show. The show's [[main event]] was a six-man tag team match which saw [[The Elite (professional wrestling)|The Golden Elite]] ([[Kota Ibushi]], Matt and Nick Jackson) defeat [[Rey Mysterio]], [[Fénix (wrestler)|Rey Fénix]], and [[Bandido (wrestler)|Bandido]].&lt;ref name =MainEvent&gt;{{cite web |url=https://twitter.com/NickJacksonYB/status/1028763185182961664 |title=The Young Bucks on Twitter |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the penultimate match, [[Kazuchika Okada]] defeated [[Marty Scurll]]. On the [[undercard]], [[Cody Rhodes|Cody]] defeated [[Nick Aldis]] to win the [[NWA Worlds Heavyweight Championship]], [[Jay Lethal]] (with [[Lanny Poffo]]) successfully defended the [[ROH World Championship]] against [[Flip Gordon]], and the [[IWGP Heavyweight Championship|IWGP Heavyweight Champion]] [[Kenny Omega]] defeated [[Pentagón Jr.|Penta El Zero]] in a non-title match.

The event is notable for being the first non-[[WWE]] or [[World Championship Wrestling]] promoted professional wrestling event in the United States to sell 10,000 tickets since 1993.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/suburbs/ct-all-in-wrestling-chicago-young-bucks-cody-20180511-story.html |title=7 things to know about 'All In' – the huge indie wrestling show coming to the Chicago area |first=Brandon |last=Howard |publisher= |access-date=May 14, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180514064332/http://www.chicagotribune.com/suburbs/ct-all-in-wrestling-chicago-young-bucks-cody-20180511-story.html |archive-date=May 14, 2018 |dead-url=no |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Background ===
In May 2017, a fan asked ''[[Wrestling Observer Newsletter]]'' journalist [[Dave Meltzer]] on [[Twitter]] if [[Ring of Honor|ROH]] could sell 10,000 tickets and Meltzer responded: "Not any time soon". [[Cody Rhodes|Cody]] took Meltzer's remark as a challenge and responded: "I'll take that bet Dave". Eventually, the idea evolved from a ROH show to a self-funded event (with ROH's official sanctioning),&lt;ref name="Aldis" /&gt; promoted by Cody and [[The Young Bucks]] (Matt Jackson and Nick Jackson).&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=ROH WAR OF THE WORLDS LONDON RESULTS: BULLET CLUB VS.

=== Pre-show===
Two matches were contested on the one-hour long pre-show, called ''Zero Hour'', which was shown live on [[WGN America]]. Cody and The Young Bucks opened the event and brought out [[Road Warrior Animal]]. Afterwards, Cody and The Young Bucks offered those in attendance free [[Hot Topic]] and Pro Wrestling Tees merchandise.

The first match of ''Zero Hour'' featured a tag team match between SoCal Uncensored (Frankie Kazarian and Scorpio Sky) and The Briscoe Brothers (Jay Briscoe and Mark Briscoe). During the match, Jay performed a [[Piledriver (professional wrestling)#Double underhook piledriver|Jay-Driller]] on Kazarian and Mark also performed an Elbow Drop on Kazarian for a near-fall. In the end, The Briscoes tried to execute a [[Professional wrestling aerial techniques#Springboard|Springboard]] [[doomsday device]] on Kazarian, but he reversed into a powerslam to win the match.

Next was the Over Budget Battle Royale with the winner facing Jay Lethal for the ROH World Championship on the main card. In the climax, [[Bubba Ray Dudley|Bully Ray]] eliminated [[Colt Cabana]]. Ray thought he won, however, [[Flip Gordon]], in the guise of Chico El Luchador, appeared and eliminated Bully Ray to win the battle royale and the ROH World Championship opportunity.

=== Preliminary matches ===
The actual pay-per-view opened with MJF facing Matt Cross in singles match. In the end, Cross executed the [[Professional wrestling aerial techniques#Shooting star press|Shooting star press]] on MJF to win the match.

Next, Christopher Daniels faced Stephen Amell. After extensive blows with Amell, Daniels pinned Amell with the [[Moonsault#Double jump moonsault|Best Moonsault Ever]] to win the match. After the match, the two shook hands.

After this, Tessa Blanchard, Chelsea Green, Madison Rayne, and Dr. Britt Baker D.M.D. faced off in a four corner survival match. In the climax, Blanchard performed the [[DDT (professional wrestling)#Hammerlock DDT|Hammerlock DDT]] on Green to win the match. After the match, the four embraced.

Next, Nick Aldis defended the NWA World&lt;!--DO NOT REMOVE THE S, THE OFFICIAL NAME USED FOR THIS EVENT IS WORLDS--&gt;s Heavyweight Championship against Cody. As Aldis went to the top rope to perform a Diving Elbow Drop, Cody's wife Brandi Rhodes tried to plead with Aldis to not do it. Aldis, however, did the move and as soon as he jumped, Brandi laid across Cody, taking the bulk of the hit. Aldis then pinned Cody, but he kicked out. Cody performed a [[Professional wrestling aerial techniques#Springboard|Beautiful Disaster]] and then the [[Cutter (professional wrestling)#Rolling cutter|Cross Rhodes]] on Aldis for a near-fall. Cody and Aldis attacked each other with punches and then Cody hit a [[Piledriver (professional wrestling)#Double underhook back-to-back piledriver|Vertebreaker]] on Aldis, but Aldis reversed it. In the end, Aldis tried to steal Cody's finisher, but Cody reversed and Aldis tried to pin him, but Cody countered into a [[Pin (professional wrestling)|Sunset flip]] to win the NWA Worlds Heavyweight Championship. With this win, Cody and his father Dusty Rhodes became the first father-son duo to win the championship.

In the next match, Hangman Adam Page faced Joey Janela in a Chicago Street Fight. In the end, Page performed the [[Piledriver (professional wrestling)#Back-to-belly piledriver|Rite of Passage]] on Janela from the top of a ladder through a table to win the match. After the match, the lights went out. Similar to [[The Undertaker]], druids appeared, but instead of druids, it was men in inflatable penis costumes. [[Joey Ryan (wrestler)|Joey Ryan]], thought to be dead, appeared and Page tried to attack him, but Ryan attacked Page and performed a [[superkick]] and Page was carried out of the arena.

Next, Jay Lethal defended the ROH World Championship against the Over Budget Battle Royale winner Flip Gordon. Lethal came out in his Black Machismo gimmick. During the match, Gordon performed a [[Moonsault#Corkscrew moonsault|Stardust Press]] on Lethal for a near-fall. Lethal tried to perform a diving powerbomb, but Gordon reversed and Lethal performed a [[DDT (professional wrestling)#Diving DDT|Lethal Injection II]] on Gordon. In the end, Lethal executed the [[Powerbomb#Sitout powerbomb|Lethal Injection]] on Gordon to win the match and retain the title. After the match, the two showed mutual respect for each other. Bully Ray then came out and attacked both Lethal and Gordon. Chicago's own Colt Cabana appeared to make the save and then the three performed a triple powerbomb on Ray through a table.

Next, Kenny Omega faced Penta El Zero in singles match. Omega tried to perform the [[Professional wrestling throws#Electric chair driver|One-Winged Angel]], but Penta reversed into [[Professional wrestling throws#Armbreaker|The Sacrifice]]. Penta executed the [[Piledriver (professional wrestling)#Package piledriver|Fear Factor]] on Omega for a nearfall and later Penta tried to perform a lariat, but Omega performed the [[Professional wrestling attacks#Knee strike|V-Trigger]] followed by a [[Professional wrestling aerial techniques#Reverse frankensteiner|Reverse frankensteiner]]. In the end, Omega performed another V-Trigger and then the One Winged Angel to win the match. After the match, the lights went out. When they came back on, Penta got up and attacked Omega with the Codebreaker, revealing himself to be [[Chris Jericho]], who challenged Omega to a match at his Rock 'N' Wrestling Rager at Sea cruise.

In the penultimate match, Kazuchika Okada faced Marty Scurll in singles match. In the end, Scurll provoked Okada and he tried to break his fingers, but Okada reverted into ''Rainmaker'' followed by a second ''Rainmaker'' to win the match.

In the main event, The Golden Elite (Matt Jackson, Nick Jackson, and Kota Ibushi) faced Rey Mysterio, Rey Fénix, and Bandido in six-man tag team match. Bandido hit Matt Jackson with backfliping backbreaker. Nick Jackson hit Bandido with superkick. The Young Bucks also superkicked both Fenix and Rey Mysterio. Ibushi and The Young Bucks performed the ''More Bang for Your Buck'' with Ibushi on Bandido for a nearfall. In the end, The Young Bucks performed the ''Meltzer Driver'' on Bandido to win the match.

Jesse Collings from ''Wrestling Inc'' said "the most important thing for the group was to put on a memorable show that satisfied the hardcore fans [...] while also entertaining more casual fans who were seeing a lot of the wrestlers for the first time and were not watching Being The Elite every week".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wrestlinginc.com/wi/news/2018/0902/645424/views-from-the-turnbuckle-all-in-review/&lt;/ref&gt;  Griffin Peltier from ''Voices of Wrestling'' said "ALL IN was not only a great PPV but a historic event in pro wrestling history.

The '''Alma-Ata Protocols''' are the founding declarations and principles of the [[Commonwealth of Independent States]] (CIS).

The leaders of Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus had agreed to the [[Belavezha Accords]] on 8 December 1991, dissolving the [[Soviet Union]] and forming the CIS.  On 21 December 1991, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova, Russia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Ukraine, and Uzbekistan agreed to the Alma-Ata Protocols, joining the CIS.  The latter agreement included the original three Belavezha signatories, as well as eight additional former Soviet republics. Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, and Georgia were the only former republics that have not participated. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/belarus/by_appnc.html|title = THE ALMA-ATA DECLARATION|website = Federal Research Division / Country Studies / Area Handbook Series / Belarus / Appendix C|publisher = Library of Congress}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

More surprisingly, the protocol allowed the Russian Federation (RSFSR) to assume the Soviet Union's UN membership, including its permanent seat on the [[United Nations Security Council]].

In [[parapsychology]] and [[spiritualism]], an '''apport''' is the alleged [[paranormal]] transference of an article from one place to another, or an appearance of an article from an unknown source that is often associated with [[poltergeist]] activity or [[séance]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://parapsych.org/historical_terms.html |title=Historical Terms Glossary |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160314213256/http://archived.parapsych.org/historical_terms.html |deadurl=yes |archivedate=2016-03-14 |accessdate=2016-12-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= "Melton"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Melton |first1=J.

==History==

A famous apport fraud is attributed to [[Charles Bailey (medium)|Charles Bailey]] (1870–1947). During a [[séance]], Bailey produced two live birds out of thin air but was undone when the dealer who sold him the birds appeared in the crowd. Common objects that are produced are stones, flowers, perfumes, and animals. These objects are said to be "gifts" from the spirit(s).&lt;ref name="Melton"/&gt;

In March 1902 in [[Berlin]], police officers interrupted a séance of the apport medium Frau Anna Rothe. Her hands were grabbed and she was wrestled to the ground. A female police assistant physically examined Rothe and discovered 157 [[flower]]s as well as [[Orange (fruit)|oranges]] and lemons hidden in her petticoat. She was arrested and charged with fraud.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Treitel|first1=Corinna|title=A Science for the Soul: Occultism and the Genesis of the German Modern|date=2004|publisher=[[Johns Hopkins University Press]]|location=Baltimore, Maryland|isbn=9780801878121|page=165}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a trial lasting six days she was sentenced to eighteen months imprisonment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Foreign Correspondence NEW YORK TIMES.E.T.H. |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1903/04/11/archives/trial-of-german-medium-frau-rothe-sentenced-to-eighteen-months.html |title=TRIAL OF GERMAN MEDIUM - Frau Rothe Sentenced to Eighteen Months' Imprisonment.

In 1926, [[Heinrich Melzer]] was exposed as a fraud as he was caught in the séance room with small stones attached to the back of his ears by flesh coloured tape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Pslmer |first1=E.

Clephan Palmer|title=The Riddle of Spiritualism|date=2003|publisher=[[Kessinger Publishing]] |isbn=9780766179318 |pages=35–39}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to neurologist [[Terence Hines]] "Some female mediums went so far as to conceal in their vagina or anus objects to be 'apported' during the seance and gauzy fabric that would become 'ectoplasm' during the seance. These were places that Victorian gentlemen, no matter how skeptical, were highly unlikely to ask to search."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hines|first1=Terence|authorlink=Terence Hines|title=Pseudoscience and the Paranormal|date=2002|publisher=[[Prometheus Books]]|location=Amherst, New York |isbn=9781573929790|page=51|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 1934 and early 1935, the [[United Australia Party]] [[Third Lyons Ministry|Government]] of [[Joseph Lyons]] failed to exclude [[Egon Kisch|Egon Erwin Kisch]], a member of the [[Communist Party of Germany]], from entering [[Australia]].
[[File:Riksdagsbrannen.jpg|thumb|upright|Kisch was one of many members of the [[Communist Party of Germany]] arrested following the [[Reichstag fire]]; he was detained in [[Spandau Prison]] before being expelled from Germany]]

== The Raging Reporter from Prague ==
[[File:1933-may-10-berlin-book-burning.JPG|150px|thumb|right|Kisch's [[Nazi book burnings|books were banned and burned]] by the [[Nazi]]s.]]
[[File:WillyMünzenberg2.jpg|upright|thumb|left|Willy Münzenberg set up a multitude of Communist Front organizations including the [[Movement Against War and Fascism]] (MAWF), sending Kisch to promote a Popular Front against Fascism in Australia.]]

Egon Kisch was a [[Jewish]] Communist and anti-war activist, born into the German-speaking Jewish community of Prague, [[Czechoslovakia]]. He had served in the [[Austro-Hungarian Army]] during [[World War I]], had deserted, and then participated in the failed Vienna revolution of 1918. He was also the author of many travel books and a famous journalist, and as the leading proponent of German-language [[reportage]] became known to admirers and critics alike as "The Raging Reporter from [[Prague]]".

From 1925 onwards, Kisch was a speaker and operative of the [[Communist International]] and a senior figure in the publishing empire of the West European branch of the [[Communist International]] run by the Communist millionaire propagandist [[Willi Münzenberg]]. The [[Communist International]]'s 1934 policy to build [[popular front]]s of all political parties opposing Fascism was to be promoted by Kisch's Australian visit.

Kisch was a vocal critic of [[Adolf Hitler]]'s [[Nazi Party|Nazi]] regime and as a result had his books banned and burned in [[Nazi Germany|Germany]]{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}. Following the [[Reichstag fire]], Kisch was detained in [[Spandau Prison|Spandau]] before he was expelled from Germany to his native Czechoslovakia.

== An alias and an informer ==
[[File:Henri-Barbusse.jpg|thumb|upright|Henri Barbusse was the secretary of the International Movement Against War and Fascism in Amsterdam]]

Experiencing the deprivations of the [[Great Depression]], 1934 Melbourne became the focus for an ideological conflict when both conservatives and socialists sought to use the centenary of the [[History of Melbourne|foundation of Melbourne]] to promote their different agendas.

Organizers of the Centenary Celebrations began by presenting an image of the city in the mould of a conservative "Britain of the Southern Hemisphere". In response, the [[Movement Against War and Fascism]] proposed holding an [[Australasia]]n conference, timed to coincide with the British Royal Tour of the celebrations. Invitations to speakers and delegates were sent throughout Australia and New Zealand. An international speaker was sought from the World Committee Against War, one of the many communist front organizations run by the West European [[Communist International]]. On 5 October 1934, French Communist [[Henri Barbusse]], acting for the [[Communist International]], placed an announcement in the Melbourne ''[[The Herald (Melbourne)|Herald]]'' stating:

:"Herr Egon Erwin Kisch, a German novelist, whose writing satirising the Hitler regime caused him to be sent to Nazi concentration camps for political prisoners, will be a visitor here for the [[1934 Centenary of Melbourne|Centenary celebrations]]... He will speak on conditions in Germany during his tour of [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]]."

[[File:Blamey.jpg|upright|thumb|left|Victoria Police Commissioner Major-General Sir Thomas Blamey informed the Lyons Government that Kisch should be excluded.]]

Inspector Ronald Browne of the Investigation Branch discovered from an informant that the World Committee Against War (one of the many Communist [[front organisation]]s known as the Münzenberg Trust) was sending a "Ewart Risch" as a speaker to the All Australian Congress of the [[Movement Against War and Fascism]] held at the [[Port Melbourne Town Hall]], Melbourne on 10–12 November 1934.

When the Investigation Branch discovered that "Ewart Risch" was Egon Kisch, known to the British [[Special Branch]] as a militant Communist opponent of the Nazis, Victoria Police Commissioner [[Thomas Blamey|Major-General Sir Thomas Blamey]], informed [[Thomas Paterson]], the federal Minister for the Interior. Paterson then made a declaration of exclusion against Kisch under the [[Immigration Restriction Act 1901]].

== Unwelcome ==
[[File:EgonKischStrathaird1934SamHood.JPG|thumb|upright|Kisch on board the ''Strathaird'', bound for Australia]]
[[File:KischMelbourne1934.JPG|upright|thumb|left|Kisch greets supporters with the clenched fist Communist Salute before making his famous leap from the ''Strathaird''.]]
Kisch arrived in [[Fremantle]] on 6 November 1934 on the [[Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company|P&amp;O]] liner [[RMS Strathaird|RMS ''Strathaird'']].

The ship was promptly boarded by representatives of the Federal Government who refused Kisch entry to Australia on the ground that he was "undesirable as an inhabitant of, or visitor to, the Commonwealth".

Kisch professed to be deeply hurt and was sure that things would be put right once he was given a chance to explain. He was scrupulous, however, in denying his membership of the Communist Party of Germany.

Kisch was required to stay in the custody of Captain Carter on board the ''Strathaird'' as it proceeded through Australian waters via [[Adelaide]], Melbourne and [[Sydney]].

== Leap into history ==
[[File:Robert Menzies 1930s.jpg|upright|thumb|left|[[Attorney-General of Australia|Attorney-General]] Robert Menzies prosecuted the Lyons Government's case against Kisch]]
On 12 November 1934, large groups of Kisch supporters gathered in Melbourne and the ''Strathaird'' was surrounded by boatloads of Kisch well-wishers. The [[International Labor Defense|International Labour Defence]] (another Münzenberg Trust front) engaged Melbourne barrister [[Joan Rosanove]], who, with a group of Kisch supporters, went aboard the ''Strathaird'' and initiated a ''[[habeas corpus]]'' action.

The Melbourne court hearing the action delayed any immediate decision on Kisch, leaving him in custody aboard the ''Strathaird'' as it departed the city.

On 13 November, Kisch defied Australian authorities when he jumped over five metres from the deck of the ''Strathaird'' onto Melbourne's [[Station Pier]], breaking his right leg. The [[Victoria Police]] quickly took charge of Kisch and carried him back on board the ''Strathaird''.

The next day, the issue rose to national prominence when Labor MP for [[Division of Batman|Batman]], [[Frank Brennan (politician)|Frank Brennan]] rose in the [[Australian House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] to accuse the Lyons government of cowardice. He asked why Kisch's right to speak in Australia was being restricted just because the Lyons administration disagreed with him.

In response, the [[Attorney-General of Australia|Attorney-General]] [[Robert Menzies]] pointed out that every civilized country had the right to determine who should or should not be allowed in, and that, since Kisch was a revolutionary and since revolution involved violence, he was not to be permitted entry.

==Kisch's legal supporters act==
[[File:H. V. Evatt in 1925.jpg|thumb|upright|High Court Justice Evatt authorised Kisch to visit Australia, finding that the Lyons Government had failed to list the reason for Kisch's exclusion in their order]]
As the ''Strathaird'' made its way up Australia's east coast to Sydney, supporters of Kisch took his case before [[High Court of Australia|High Court]] [[H. V. Evatt|Justice Evatt]], who found that the Federal Government had incorrectly excluded Kisch from Australia because they had failed to list in their order the advice received from the British Government. Evatt released Kisch and ordered that he be free to visit as long as he respected the laws of Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|50|1934|litigants=R v Carter; Ex parte Kisch |date=16 November 1934 |parallelcite=[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1934/50.pdf (1934) 52 {{abbr|CLR|Commonwealth Law Reports}} 221] |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Government uses the dictation test ==
The ''Strathaird'' arrived in Sydney Harbour on 16 November 1934. The Federal Government now attempted to exclude Kisch using the [[Immigration Restriction Act 1901|Immigration Restriction Act]]. The Act as amended in 1905 provided that "any person who (...) when an officer dictates to him not less than fifty words in any prescribed language, fails to write them out in that language in the presence of the officer" would not be admitted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite Legislation AU|Cth|num_act|iraa1905171905384|Immigration Restriction Amendment Act 1905}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

This was primarily intended, and used, as a means to exclude non-whites from entering Australia under the [[White Australia Policy]], but it could be, and occasionally was, used to exclude other undesirables. Kisch demonstrated his fluency in a number of European languages, and he was then asked to write the [[Lord's Prayer]] in [[Scottish Gaelic]]. He refused to participate and was deemed to have failed the test. He was then taken into custody, this time by the [[New South Wales Police Force|New South Wales police]], who released him on [[Australian pound|AU£]]200 bail.

The dictation test was also used to exclude another anti-war activist who had been invited to speak. Irishman (and therefore British subject) Gerald Griffin, had been given a dictation test in Dutch, which he had failed as he was meant to do. In his memoir ''Australian Landfall'', Kisch records with gusto how Griffin then entered Australia under a false name and led the authorities a merry dance as he popped up unannounced to speak at meeting after meeting.

==A literary reception==
Kisch attended a [[Fellowship of Australian Writers]] luncheon in honour of British [[poet laureate]] [[John Masefield]], along with [[Albert Piddington]], [[Kenneth Slessor]] and [[Norman Lindsay]]. Controversy ensued when three government ministers and several writers mounted objections.

The Movement Against War and Fascism organized a Kisch reception committee including [[Katharine Susannah Prichard]], [[Vance Palmer|Vance]] and [[Nettie Palmer]], [[E. J. Brady]] and [[Louis Esson]]. This group formed the nucleus of what later became the Writers League, drawing on the example of Egon Kisch's own journalistic dedication to reportage. The reception committee organized concerts featuring performances from Greek, Italian, Yugoslav, Jewish, Russian and [[Indigenous Australians|Aboriginal]] artists with the theme of international opposition to [[Fascism]].

==The High Court rules==
[[File:Maurice Blackburn oilpainting1942 (cropped).jpg|upright|thumb|left|Labor Parliamentarian and [[Movement Against War and Fascism|MAWF]] member Maurice Blackburn acted as one of Kisch's legal counsel]]
[[File:Albert Piddington.jpg|thumb|upright|Sydney's Red [[King's Counsel|KC]] Albert Piddington represented Kisch, with Smith and Blackburn]]

Egon Kisch's legal team was headed by [[Christian Jollie Smith]], who secured a writ of ''[[habeas corpus]]'' for Kisch and briefed [[Albert Piddington]] and [[Maurice Blackburn]], who took his case to the full bench of the High Court, which on 19 December 1934 ruled that he be free to visit Australia. Kisch's legal team were able to demonstrate that Constable Mackay, who had administered the test, although born in Scotland, was not actually able to understand the Lord's Prayer in Scottish Gaelic himself. Crucially, the Court ruled that the dictation test had been invalid in any case, in that Scottish Gaelic was not "a European language" within the meaning of the ''Immigration Restriction Act''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|63|1934|litigants=R v Wilson ; Ex parte Kisch |parallelcite=[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1934/63.pdf (1934) 52 {{abbr|CLR|Commonwealth Law Reports}} 234] |date=19 December 1934 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Kisch was now free to visit and speak in Australia. Or so it seemed.

==Prime Minister Lyons intervenes==
[[File:Joseph Aloysius Lyons portrait, 1930s.jpg|upright|thumb|left|Australian Prime Minister Joseph Lyons acted to exclude Kisch a third time]]
In December 1934 the [[Prime Minister of Australia|Australian Prime Minister]] [[Joseph Lyons]] contacted the British Government and received the following written advice:
''Position is that Egon Kisch was refused leave to land in the United Kingdom in September 1933 on account of his known subversive activities stop permission to enter the United Kingdom would now not be granted to him stop [[James Henry Thomas|Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs]] stop''

The government then made a second declaration under the Immigration Restriction Act, overcoming the technical shortcoming which Evatt had found in the first, and on 21 January 1935 the Central Sydney Police Court convicted Kisch of being a prohibited immigrant and sentenced him to three months imprisonment with [[Penal labour|hard labour]]. However, Kisch was released on bail when his lawyer took an appeal to High Court [[H. V. Evatt|Justice Evatt]], who again ruled that Kisch be set free. Evatt pointed out that, under the law, the minister had no power to rule on immigration matters after a person had entered Australia and he set up a hearing of the Full Bench of the High Court for March.

==Kisch free==
[[File:Kischdomain1935.JPG|thumb|Kisch addressed a crowd of 18,000 in Sydney's Domain, telling Australians of his first-hand experience with the dangers of the Nazi regime]]

Kisch was free to move about and speak. He became a popular figure, addressing meetings, rallies and crowds in [[Queensland]], [[New South Wales]] and [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], warning of the dangers of the Nazi regime. On 17 February 1935, he addressed an estimated 18,000-strong audience in [[The Domain, Sydney|Sydney's ''Domain'']]:

:"I have had three adventurous months since I last saw you. I know the [[Police Courts|Police Court]], the [[Quarter Sessions|Quarter Sessions Court]], the [[High Court of Australia|High Court]] with one judge and the High Court with five judges. But whenever the court let me go I was arrested again. I have learnt to speak English better. Perhaps I do not speak King's English but it's Kisch English anyhow. I did not come here to tell there is terrorism in Europe. I come here to tell you how to stop it. I have been an eye-witness. I was arrested the day the [[Reichstag fire|Reichstag]] was burnt down by [[Hermann Göring|Göring]] and his lieutenants. I saw my friend, [[Erich Mühsam]], the poet, whose works I translated, made to walk naked, even in winter, and to lick up the spittle of his captors. All his limbs were broken gradually, and he died."

== The Government does a deal ==
Facing the dilemma that further persecution and legal wrangling simply promoted Kisch’s cause, the Lyons Government proposed a compromise. On 26 February 1935, the Melbourne ''[[The Argus (Melbourne)|Argus]]'' reported:
:"Provided that Egon Erwin Kisch, the Czechoslovakian author, gives certain undertakings to the authorities, the Federal Ministry is willing to recommend [[Isaac Isaacs|His Excellency]] the [[Governor-General of Australia|Governor-General]] to remit the sentence of imprisonment for three months with hard labour imposed on him in Sydney ... there is no desire on the part of the Ministry to compel him to serve a term of imprisonment if he is willing to leave immediately."

Ultimately, the Lyons government agreed to cut its losses and offered to remit Kisch's sentence, stop all legal proceedings and pay Kisch [[Australian pound|AU£]]450 for his costs in exchange for an agreed exit date of 11 March 1935. Having achieved notoriety above and beyond anyone's expectations, and public exposure of his warnings of Adolf Hitler and the dangers of fascism, Kisch accepted their offer and departed Sydney on the [[Orient Steam Navigation Company|Orient]] liner ''Ormonde'', bound for Marseille.

== Legacy ==

In response to their humiliation, the Lyons Government introduced a new law, whereby a person charged as a prohibited immigrant became ineligible for bail.

The dictation test was used again in 1936, controversially and for reasons that were never made clear, to exclude Mabel Freer, a white British woman born in India, who was confronted with a test in Italian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Robertson|first1=Kel|title=Dictating to One of ‘Us’: the Migration of Mrs Freer|url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/journals/MqLJ/2005/12.html|website=Macquarie Law Journal|publisher=Australasian Legal Information Institute|accessdate=2017-04-26|date=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Interior Minister [[Thomas Paterson]] resigned from the Lyons Cabinet following the controversy. The test was not abolished until 1958.

Kisch detailed his antipodean adventures in his 1937 book ''Australian Landfall''. He returned to Czechoslovakia in 1946. Following his death in 1948 he was acknowledged as a hero of the [[German Democratic Republic]].
[[File:Stamps of Germany (DDR) 1985, MiNr Zusammendruck 2940.jpg|thumb|Kisch and his birth house portrayed on a stamp issued by the [[East Germany|GDR]] to celebrate the centenary of his birth]]

The Kisch Welcome Committee developed into a literary appreciation society known as the Writers League.

Maurice Blackburn was expelled from the [[Australian Labor Party]] over his membership of the [[Movement Against War and Fascism]] and its links to the Communist Party. As a consequence he was defeated in his electorate of [[Division of Bourke|Bourke]]. However his Wife [[Doris Blackburn]] successfully contested Bourke and served as an independent after her husband's death.

The [[Communist International]] policy of creating a united front against fascism in Australia was successfully resisted by Australia's mainstream political parties. The Australian Labor Party opposed links and cooperation with the Communist Party which remained isolated and marginalized.

Melbourne communist writer [[Frank Hardy]] detailed Kisch's Australian visit in his fictionalized version of [[John Wren|John Wren's]] life, ''[[Power Without Glory]]'' (1950). In 1976 this story was adapted for television by the Australian Broadcasting Company in which Egon Kisch was played by Kurt Ludescher.

[[Robert Menzies]] visited Germany in August 1938, as Attorney-General of Australia in the pro-[[appeasement]] Lyons government. Menzies spent several weeks in Nazi Germany and was extremely impressed with the achievements of the "New Germany", and on his return gave public talks expressing warm approval of the Hitlerite dictatorship, as he said, "based on my personal experience". Menzies later attempted to distance himself from the Kisch affair, claiming the debacle had been initiated by Thomas Paterson and that his own involvement had just been a mistake. In 1951 Christian Jollie Smith worked with H. V. Evatt to prevent an attempt by Menzies (now Prime Minister) to ban the Communist Party in Australia.

The '''Bangs Sisters''', Mary "May" E. Bangs (1862-1917) and Elizabeth "Lizzie" Snow Bangs (1859-1920), were two fraudulent [[spiritualism|spiritualist]] [[Mediumship|mediums]] from Chicago, who made a career out of painting the dead or "Spirit Portraits".&lt;ref name="SI"&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Nickell |first=Joe |author-link=Joe Nickell |date=June 2000 |title=Spirit Painting (Part II)|url=http://www.csicop.org/sb/show/spirit_painting_2 |magazine=Skeptical Briefs |volume=10 |issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Witter"&gt;{{cite book|last=Witter|first=David|title=Chicago Magic: A History of Stagecraft and Spectacle|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=feR2CQAAQBAJ|date=5 November 2013|publisher=The History Press |location=Charleston, SC |isbn=978-1-62619-127-3 |page=29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert A.

Carrington addressed a letter in a sealed envelope to 'Dearest Mother Jane Thompson' (who never existed), and he received a reply addressed to 'Dearly Loved Son Harold,' signed by his devoted mother, Jane. Moreover, Carrington had the magician David P. Abbott duplicate the Bangs sisters' work exactly. Over the years a number of charges of fraud were brought against them, and fraud in their slate writing and their materialized spirits were convincingly established."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
[[File:BangsWindow.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.3|1905 Newspaper Ad: "The Bangs Sisters"]]
Elizabeth was born in 1859 to Edward D. Bangs (1827-1899) and Meroe L. Stevens Bangs (1832-1917) while they were living in [[Atchison, Kansas]], and Mary was born there in 1862. Edward was a [[tinsmith]] and stove repairman, originally from Massachusetts. Their mother was a medium herself, and soon got her four children (sons Edward and W.B.) into the act.&lt;ref name="miraclefactory1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Karr |first=Todd |url=http://www.miraclefactory.net/mpt/view.php?id=195&amp;type=articles |title=David P.

They moved to Chicago in 1868.&lt;ref name="globe1881"/&gt; By the early 1870s the Bangs family were performing [[seances]] as described in an article by [[Steven Sanborn Jones]] published on August 3, 1872 in ''[[Religio-Philosophical Journal]]'' titled "An Evening with the Bangs Children."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Jones |first=Steven Sanborn |date=August 3, 1972 |title=An Evening with the Bangs Children |url=http://www.iapsop.com/archive/materials/religio-philosophical_journal/rpj_aug_1872.pdf |format=PDF |newspaper=Religio-Philosophical Journal  |volume=7 |issue=20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160710230616/http://iapsop.com/archive/materials/religio-philosophical_journal/rpj_aug_1872.pdf |archive-date=2016-07-10 |dead-url=no |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; People paid to be entertained at the Bangs home. Messages from the dead appeared on slabs of slate as chairs and furniture moved about the room. The children were tied up in a cabinet, then a guitar inside strummed and hands waved from within. For the finale, Mary brought forward a cat, said to be a "spirit kitten" from the afterworld.&lt;ref name="miraclefactory1"/&gt;

In the summer of 1881, May and her mother were arrested for "doing business without a license",&lt;ref name="globe1881"&gt;{{cite news |date=August 23, 1881 |title=News Item |url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/11702367/ |newspaper=The Atchison Daily Globe |location=Atchison, Kansas |subscription=yes |quote=Mrs. DeWolf, Mrs. Bangs and Miss May Bangs, mediums, were arrested at the Otis House this morning by the Marshal for doing business without a license.

Mrs. and Miss Bangs were formerly residents of Atchison, the husband and father having carried on the tin and stove business here thirteen years ago, but we believe they are now residents of Chicago. }}"&lt;/ref&gt; and while they claimed to be [[Evangelism|evangelists]] and such charges could not be brought against ministers, they were fined by the police court the following day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=August 24, 1881 |title=Police Court |url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/11702462/ |newspaper=The Atchison Daily Globe |location=Atchison, Kansas |subscription=yes |quote=...the Bangs spiritual jugglers, giving shows without license, $5.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 2, 1888, two plainclothes police arrested May and Lizzie during a seance and confiscated all of their props.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=April 2, 1988 |title=Exposing a 'Spook' Fake |url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1888/04/02/page/1/article/exposing-a-spook-fake |newspaper=Chicago Daily Tribune |location=Chicago, Illinois |page=3 |quote=May Bangs, attired in the garb of a Russian princess, caught while exhibiting herself as a spirit at an opening in the cabinet.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="frauds1905"&gt;{{cite news |date=February 28, 1905 |title=Bangs 'Sisters' Interest Police |url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1905/02/28/page/3/article/bangs-sisters-interest-police |newspaper=Chicago Daily Tribune |location=Chicago, Illinois |page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were released on bail the next day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=April 2, 1988 |title=The Bangs Sisters Appear in Court |url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1888/04/03/page/1/article/the-bangs-sisters-appear-in-court|newspaper=Chicago Daily Tribune |location=Chicago, Illinois |page=1 |quote=The bond of W.B.

At the same time, an article in the ''Washington Post'' published on April 17, 1888 reported that Lizzie and May Bangs had created the very lucrative firm, the "Bangs Sisters", which operated spiritualistic parlors in the Chicago area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=April 17, 1888 |title=Chicago's Bogus Spiritualists |newspaper=Washington Post |location=Washington, D.C. |page=6 |quote=Lizzie and May Bangs, under the firm name of the Bangs Sisters, conduct the leading spiritualistic establishment in Chicago…. Their elegant parlors have been crowded by day as well as by night and money flowed into their coffers in large streams.}}&lt;/ref&gt; That year, one of their wealthy clients, photographer [[Henry Jestram]], reportedly paid vast amounts of his fortune for their seances. When Jestram died after being committed to an insane asylum, many blamed the Bangs Sisters.&lt;ref name="tribune1888"&gt;{{cite news |date=April 20, 1888 |title=The Bangs Sisters |url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/9031967/ |newspaper=Hornellsville Weekly Tribune |location=Hornellsville, New York |page=1 |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By November 1890, May was on her second divorce, from wealthy chemical manufacturer [[Henry H. Graham]]. They had been married under the pretense that his dead wife had told him to do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=April 17, 1890 |title=Says He Was Wed While Drugged |url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1890/04/17/page/2/article/says-he-was-wed-while-drugged |newspaper=Chicago Daily Tribune |location=Chicago, Illinois |page=2 |quote=On his return in that state Miss Bangs told him she had had a communication with his wife, who had requested that to please her he would marry the medium.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the ''Chicago Daily Tribune'', in March 1890, a Chicago grand jury declined to bring charges against the Bangs Sisters,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=March 7, 1890 |title=The Carrie Sawyer Gang Indicted |url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1890/03/07/page/9/article/the-carrie-sawyer-gang-indicted |newspaper=Chicago Daily Tribune |location=Chicago, Illinois |page=9 |quote=The evidence against this gang was no more complete and not as full and picturesque as that which we presented to the grande jury against the Bangs sisters. We failed to secure their indictment, but this through no flaw in the evidence.}}&lt;/ref&gt; but in May 1891, the Illinois Senate passed a bill:

&lt;blockquote&gt;...prohibiting anyone from personating the spirits of the dead, commonly known as spirit-medium séances, on penalty of fine and imprisonment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=May 16, 1891 |title=Doesn't Want Any "Fake Spooks" |url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1891/05/16/page/8/article/doesnt-want-any-fake-spooks |newspaper=Chicago Daily Tribune |location=Chicago, Illinois |page=9 |quote=Col.

According to the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', the two sisters even fooled [[G.W.N. Yost]], one of the main investors in the typewriter, with their "spirit typewriter" which produced messages from everyone from [[Moses]] to [[James Garfield]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=July 12, 1895 |title=Robbed of Thousands: Typewriter Inventor Yost Defrauded of Much Money |url=http://nebnewspapers.unl.edu/lccn/sn94056415/1895-07-12/ed-1/seq-2/ |newspaper=The McCook Tribune |location=McCook, Nebraska |page=2 |quote=When visiting the word's fair in Chicago some acquaintances told Mr. Yost that they knew of a young girl named Lizzie Bangs, who was able to secure the most remarkable statements from dead worthies by means of an ancient and very decrepit typewriting machine.

It was not long before they ventured out of Chicago. As reported in the ''[[Fort Wayne Sentinel]]'' on September 10, 1894, the Bangs conducted a Massachusetts wedding ceremony between a wealthy woman and her dead fiancé.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=April 2, 1988 |title=New Item |url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/29145739/ |newspaper=Fort Wayne Sentinel |location=Fort Wayne, Indiana |page=4 |subscription=yes |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the next five years, they regularly held seances and performed the spirit slate writings at their home in Chicago. The spirit paintings were the most commanding of price, with people paying anywhere between $15 to $150 per portrait. Dr. [[Isaac K. Funk]] of [[Funk and Wagnalls]] paid $1,500 for a number of departed portraits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=February 25, 1905 |title=Peddle Work of 'Ghosts': Chicago Mediums Said to Have Duped Isaac Funk |url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1905/02/25/page/3/article/peddle-work-of-ghosts |newspaper=Chicago Daily Tribune |location=Chicago, Illinois |page=3  |quote=The Rev.

In 1907 came the next victim of May's marriages. Millionaire leather manufacturer [[Jacob H. Lesher]] was "told" to marry May by his dead mother, and according to a July 16, 1909 story in the ''Chicago Daily Tribune'', was divorced and penniless in less than 24 months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=July 16, 1909 |title=Spirit Tip Costs $400,000 |url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1909/07/16/page/3/article/spirit-tip-costs-400-000 |newspaper=Chicago Daily Tribune |location=Chicago, Illinois |page=3 |quote=Business tips from the spirit world are blamed for the failure of Jacob H.

==Fraud==
[[File:DavidPAbbottMagician.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.8|[[David P. Abbott]], a magician who exposed the Bangs Sisters.]]
Regarding the sisters drawings, magic historian David Witter has noted that "experts have surmised that sketches were made beforehand, hidden and slowly moved forward into the light by a free hand while the subjects were not looking."&lt;ref name="Witter"/&gt;

Skeptical investigator [[Joe Nickell]] has written that "the Bangses were exposed as tricksters many times."&lt;ref name="SI"/&gt;

In 1901, the psychologist [[Stanley LeFevre Krebs]] exposed the sisters as frauds; he employed a hidden mirror and caught them removing a blank letter sealed between two slates and writing a reply which they would pretend a spirit had written.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Krebs |first=Stanley LeFevre |title=A Description of Some Trick Methods Used by Miss Bangs, of Chicago |date=January 1901 |url=http://www.iapsop.com/archive/materials/spr_proceedings/spr_journal_v10_1901-2.pdf |journal=Journal of the Society for Psychical Research |volume=10 |issue=175 |pages=10–16 |via=IAPSOP}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Joe Nickell|Nickell, Joe]]. (2001). ''Real-Life X-Files: Investigating the Paranormal''. University Press of Kentucky. pp. 267-268. {{ISBN|978-0813122106}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hereward Carrington]] who sat with the sisters in 1909 found their slate-writing to be fraudulent.&lt;ref name="Tabori 1972"&gt;[[Paul Tabori|Tabori, Paul]]. (1972). ''Pioneers of the Unseen''. Souvenir Press. pp. 47-48. {{ISBN|0-285-62042-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had also set up a trap by inventing a fictitious mother named "Jane Thompson" in a sealed letter. He received a reply signed by Jane from the sisters. Psychical researcher [[Paul Tabori]] noted that Carrington "also analysed their way of producing 'spirit paintings' or 'portraits'. The ladies simply substituted one canvas for another, under the cover of their voluminous dress, the table or window-curtains."&lt;ref name="Tabori 1972"/&gt;

The Bangs sisters were defended by the spiritualist writer [[William Usborne Moore]]. He stated in his book ''Glimpses of the Next State'' that Carrington had never visited their house. After Carrington gave incontrovertible evidence he had visited the sisters and caught them in fraud, Moore had to publicly retract his charges in a letter for ''[[Light (spiritualist journal)|Light]]'', December 14, 1912.&lt;ref&gt;[[William Usborne Moore|Moore, William Usborne]]. ''Mr Hereward Carrington and the Bangs Sisters''. Light. December 14, 1912. p. 598&lt;/ref&gt;

Magician [[Milbourne Christopher]] has written:

:Wilmar ([[William Marriott (magician)|William Marriott]]) had read about the marvelous paintings produced during seances by a pair of Chicago psychics, the Bangs sisters. He wrote David P. Abbott, an amateur magician and investigator of alleged psychic phenomena, who lived in Omaha, Nebraska, asking if by chance he had solved the mystery. Abbott replied that not only had he duplicated the marvel, he also had added several touches to make the feat effective onstage. Abbott described the routine in detail.&lt;ref&gt;[[Milbourne Christopher|Christopher, Milbourne]]. (1996). ''The Illustrated History of Magic''. Greenwood Publishing Group. p. 261. {{ISBN|0-435-07016-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1913, [[David P. Abbott]] published a booklet on the subject ''The Spirit Portrait Mystery, Its Final Solution'', revealing fraudulent methods of producing the portraits.&lt;ref&gt;Abbott, David P. (1913).

"'''Basketball Jones featuring Tyrone Shoelaces'''" is a song by [[Cheech and Chong]] that first appeared on the 1973 album ''[[Los Cochinos]]''.

Sung in [[falsetto]] by [[Cheech Marin]], playing the title character Tyrone (as in "tie-your-own") Shoelaces, it tells the story of Shoelaces' love of basketball.  It is a parody of the No. 16 [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] song "Love Jones" by [[Brighter Side of Darkness]].  In the album version, the song is preceded by a mock interview with Jones' basketball coach named "Umgwana Kickbooti", in a parody of a ''[[Wide World of Sports (U.S. TV series)|Wide World of Sports]]'' interview conducted by a character named "Red [[Blazer]]".

The songs opening lyric, "basketball jones, I got a basketball jones", references "jones" as slang for craving or addiction. A "basketball jones" thus refers to loving basketball so much that it overtakes all other thoughts.

Musicians who appeared on the record included [[George Harrison]],&lt;ref name=ATN&gt;{{cite book|last=Castleman|first=Harry|title=All Together Now – The First Complete Beatles Discography 1961–1975|year=1977|publisher=Ballantine Books|location=New York|isbn=0-345-25680-8|edition=Second|author2=Podrazik, Walter J.|page=126|chapter=1973 – Wings Over Europe}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Billy Preston]], [[Tom Scott (musician)|Tom Scott]], and [[Carole King]] (so the record became the highest peaking single on which she appeared during 1973). [[The Blossoms]] and [[Michelle Phillips]] (from [[The Mamas &amp; the Papas]]) performed vocals as [[cheerleader]]s on the track.

The song was released as a single in August 1973 and reached No. 15 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100, becoming the only spoof to peak higher than the corresponding original.  It was backed with "Don't Bug Me", also from ''Los Cochinos''.  To coincide with the graffiti artwork from the album's cover, both sides of the single feature the Ode label covered with graffiti.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media notes
| title = Los Cochinos ©#!!*
| titlelink = Los Cochinos
| others = Cheech y Chong
| year = 1973
| type = CD
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some notes on the recording of the track, taken from the booklet accompanying ''[[Where There's Smoke There's Cheech &amp; Chong]]'', read:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Cheech sings, and Tommy plays piano—that's all it was at first. In Cheech's words, "George Harrison and those guys were in the next studio recording, and so Lou [Adler] just ran over there and played [it for him].  They made up the track right on the spot." "That was a wild session," Lou Adler recalls. "I probably called Carole [King] and told her to come down, but with Harrison and [Klaus] Voorman—I didn't call and say come in and play.  Everyone happened to be in the A&amp;M studios at that particular time, doing different projects.  It was spilling out of the studio into the corridors."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Other members of the ad-hoc all-stars included [[Nicky Hopkins]] (piano), Tom Scott (sax), Billy Preston (organ), Jimmy Karstein (drums) and [[Jim Keltner]] (percussion).

The song was covered by [[Barry White]] and [[Chris Rock]] in the 1996 film ''[[Space Jam]]''. Rock performed the higher-pitched vocals and shouted lines.

The song is featured in a 2008 commercial for the television series ''[[House of Payne]]'', and the [[The Simpsons (season 22)|season 22]] episode of ''[[The Simpsons]]'', "[[A Midsummer's Nice Dream]]".

==Animated film==
[[Image:Basketball Jones.jpg|thumb|Tyrone Shoelaces]]
''Basketball Jones'' is a 1973 animated [[short film]] based on the [[Cheech and Chong]] song. The cartoon was created to promote the song's release in the United States. It is about a teenager named Tyrone Shoelaces and his love of basketball.  The short was designed by animator [[imdbname:0340502|Paul Gruwell]] who worked on many classic series including ''[[The Banana Splits]]'', ''[[Scooby-Doo]]'', ''[[G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero (1985 TV series)|GI Joe]]'', ''[[The Transformers (TV series)|The Transformers]]'', ''The Simpsons'', and the film ''[[Heavy Metal (film)|Heavy Metal]]''.

In the animation, Shoelaces, who appears as a stereotypical [[African American]], is shown from birth having a skill for "dribbling" (in which he is shown to be [[drooling]]) and, as a result, his mother gives him a basketball for a gift. Shoelaces takes an immediate liking to the ball and takes it wherever he goes. This sets up a trip to the "basketball championship," in which he begins preaching to potential teammates, coaches, cheerleaders (complete with "day of the week" panties visible) to "help him out." A gospel chorus begins singing, and slowly escalates. A few short shots of Shoelaces actually playing basketball, mostly dribbling downcourt on a breakaway, are visible, but the rest of the video is primarily devoted to shots of increasingly unusual and distant people in "the entire stadium" and "around the world" singing along to "Basketball Jones." At the end of the short, Shoelaces begins growing at a dramatic pace, breaking through the stadium roof and becoming big enough to use the [[moon]] as a basketball while [[Cheech and Chong]], [[Viet Cong]], [[King Kong]], [[feral cat|alley cats]], men in business suits, a mountaintop [[guru]], [[The Singing Nun]], and [[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]] sing along to the song. The short film encapsulates the political moods of the 70s and predicts [[Richard Nixon]]'s impeachment before the president actually resigned in August 8, 1974.

"Basketball Jones" was originally seen in theaters in late 1973, before showings of [[Hal Ashby]]'s ''[[The Last Detail]]'' at select screens.&lt;ref name="RS #157"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date=March 28, 1974 |title=Random Notes |journal=[[Rolling Stone]] |publisher=Straight Arrow Publishers, Inc. |volume= |issue=157 |pages=28 |url= |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It can be seen during the 1974 film ''[[California Split]]'', directed by [[Robert Altman]], although its use in the film prevented ''California Split'' from being released on VHS or Laserdisc due to [[Columbia Pictures]]' refusal to pay [[royalties]] for the song. Altman later removed the song (but not the cartoon) from the film so it could be released on DVD.

The cartoon was re-released in 1976, when it was shown before the film ''[[Tunnel Vision (1976 film)|Tunnel Vision]]''. The film is perhaps best known for being featured in another highly acclaimed [[Hal Ashby]] film, the 1979 Oscar-nominated ''[[Being There]]'', where [[Peter Sellers]]'s character, [[Chauncey Gardiner]] watches the cartoon in a limousine.

==Plot==
The film opens in a [[Warri]] prison in the [[Niger Delta]] where a [[noose]] is being set up to [[Hanging|hang]] Ebiere ([[Mbong Amata]]). It switches to [[Los Angeles]], [[California]]; Tom Hudson ([[Mickey Rourke]]), [[Chief Executive Officer|CEO]] of Western Oil is kidnapped on his way to the airport by a movement group tagged "United People's Front for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta People of Nigeria". The kidnap is carried out by Tamuno ([[Enyinna Nwigwe]] - the leader of the movement), Timi ([[Wyclef Jean]]), Opuwei ([[Akon]]), Timi ([[Razaaq Adoti]]) and Pere (Robert Peters) after orchestrating an accident near [[2nd Street Tunnel|the second street tunnel]]. Also kidnapped is a reporter, Kristy ([[Kim Basinger]]), and her cameraman. Tom Hudson, his wife (Kristin Peterson) and Kristy, together with several others at the accident scene are captured and held hostage within this tunnel which has already been closed off on both sides by the group. Seven hours, no communication is heard from the tunnel - the police, the anti-terrorism unit and the general public have no idea who the "terrorists" are or what they want. Meanwhile in the tunnel, Tamuno tells Tom that they are in Los Angeles to save Ebiere and declares that if Ebiere is eventually hung in Nigeria, then the "truly guilty" ones should go with her. He releases the women and children and instructs Kristy to record what is happening in the tunnel.

The film flashes back to 21 years earlier during military era as Tamuno narrates their ordeal to the public via Kristy's camera. Ebiere ([[Mbong Amata]]) is born in Warri during the Military era; she concludes high school and is offered scholarship by Western Oil to study oversea. A few years later, an oil pipe in the Niger Delta bursts and the people of the community go to fetch petrol from the pipe, Dede ([[Hakeem Kae-Kazim]]), a fisherman discovers that fishes in the river have been killed by the oil spillage. The police arrive at the spillage site and demand that the Villagers vacate the area, but no one listens to them. Ebiere arrives in the village — her home, and is told her mother and siblings are getting fuel from a spillage site. On her way to the site, the site explodes killing her mother and siblings. The explosion appears to have been an accident, caused after one of the police officers sent to disperse the oil collectors lights a cigarette after having failed to do so. He is killed as well. Ebiere speaks up at a consolation visit of Western Oil staff (An oil rig American company based in Warri) and is applauded by members of the Community. This establishes her as one of the speakers for the Niger Delta Community, she is approached by Kate Summers ([[Sarah Wayne Callies]]), a reporter who likes her speech and says Ebiere is different from the rest of the community people, Kate becomes one of Ebiere's friends and supporters. Ebiere starts to organize peaceful protests and mass rallies for their voice to be heard, fighting for the Niger Delta to be cleaned up and well maintained — they are sometimes beaten, killed and/or arrested by the Military in the process. Ebiere is offered bribes severally by Western Oil representatives to stop her from instigating the people, but she always declines.

However, Dede, whose wife and only child died in the explosion, believes that protests will never solve anything and that the Government can only listen through violence. Dede starts to have people on his side (including Tamuno, who was a dedicated police officer) after an incident in which the Army invades their village and rapes their women, right in front of them. Ebiere continues with her protests while Dede forms a militant group, showing their displeasure through violence, vandalism and kidnapping Western Oil officials. Western Oil eventually convinces Ebiere (who is now Dede's love interest) to help ask Dede and his group for dialogue with government. It turns out to be a ploy to get them arrested. A shoot-out occurs, leading to Dede and his group being killed.

Chief Gadibia (Isaac Yongo), one of the chiefs who have been receiving bribes from Western Oil, and also embezzling funds meant for community development, tells his fellow elders that he is no longer interested in the "unclean" money and he wants to return his share to the people. Gadibia dies the following day, the Elders having poisoned his drink the previous night. Peter ([[OC Ukeje]]), Gadibia's son, to whom he has already confessed, explains the incident to Ebiere and how sure he is that his father was murdered by the Elders. Gadibia's stolen fund is discovered in his house and the other elders involved are captured by the community people, led by Ebiere. Ebiere wants the Elders to be reported to the police, but the people refuse to listen and set them ablaze instead. Everyone at the vicinity of the crime is arrested by the Police; Ebiere however claims responsibility for the crime and is sentenced to death by hanging. The film shifts back to the present in the Los Angeles tunnel; Tom Hudson calls Nigeria's Head of State and tells him to do something to stop the execution of Ebiere, but his request isn't granted. Angela ([[Vivica Fox]]) of the US Anti-terrorism unit advises that the United States make a diplomatic call to the Nigerian Government, but the head of the department says they do not negotiate with terrorists. They eventually resolve to issue a deceptive press release, stating that Ebiere has been released. When the emancipation movement is informed about the release, they drop their weapons as a result and also release the rest of the hostages, including Tom Hudson. They are arrested by the United States Police, while Ebiere still gets hanged in Nigeria.

==Production==

===Development and inspiration===
Jeta Amata, who grew up in the Niger Delta stated in an interview that it has been a while since he has wanted to make a film on the Niger Delta. He had written three scripts on it for about eight years; but as the issues kept escalating, it seemed more difficult to make "but I got to the point where I knew it just has to be now".&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated6&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cnn.com/2013/03/29/showbiz/jeta-amata-black-november/ | title='I am Nollywood': Director's tale of Niger Delta struggle | publisher=[[CNN]] | work= | date=29 March 2013 | accessdate=31 July 2014 |author1=Sesay, Isha |author2=Ellis, Jessica }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated7&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.aprokocity.com/jeta-amata-black-november-was-inspired-by-niger-delta-miltants/#axzz36AEF7fej | title=JETA AMATA: 'BLACK NOVEMBER' WAS INSPIRED BY NIGER DELTA MILTANTS | publisher=Aproko City  | date=31 March 2013 | accessdate=2 August 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Black November'' is fiction based on an actual event, the title being derived from the month in which activist [[Ken Saro-Wiwa]] was executed in 1995. Amata had once met Saro-Wiwa through his father and was affected by his death.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;&lt;ref name="All African cinemas"/&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated6 /&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated5 /&gt; The recent [[Conflict in the Niger Delta#Emergence of armed groups in Niger Delta|Niger Delta militancy]] further triggered Amata's interest to make the film; Jeta Amata had to meet with most of the Niger Delta ex-militants such as [[Mujahid Dokubo-Asari|Asari Dokubo]] and [[Ebikabowei Victor-Ben|Boyloaf]] to listen to their sides of the story.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated7 /&gt; He stated in an interview: "What I'm doing is what they did, but without weapons." Amata explained that even though the film touched some political points, he is more concerned about the human parts of the story, about the feelings of the people and what they passed through: "We are not trying to fight the government, trying to fight the oil companies, no -- we are trying to repair what has been damaged".&lt;ref name=autogenerated6 /&gt;  The film was majorly funded by a Nigerian business magnate, Captain [[Hosa Wells Okunbo]], who says he does not want to go down in history as "just another rich merchant", he wants to give something back to the region that made him wealthy.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;&lt;ref name="All African cinemas"/&gt; 

In late 2011, the director announced plans to [[reissue]] the film which had initially been finalized with the title ''[[Black Gold (2011 Nigerian film)|Black Gold]]'' and released in early months of 2011. According to Amata, the film was "out of date": "It had to be more current. It had to adhere strictly to what was going on right now – the Arab spring and all that". This change resulted in approximately 60% part of ''Black Gold'' being reshot, but still sewn into the original plot of ''Black Gold''. Mickey Rourke, Kim Basinger and Anne Heche who were not part of ''Black Gold'' were also added to the cast line-up of ''Black November''.&lt;ref name=autogenerated5 /&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated4&gt;{{cite web | url=http://blogs.indiewire.com/shadowandact/black-november-announces-screenings-and-new-poster | title=Jeta Amata's 'Black November' Announces US, UK, Nigeria Release Dates | publisher=Shadow and act | work=[[IndieWire]]| date=18 September 2012 | accessdate=2 August 2014 | author= Greeves, Natasha }}&lt;/ref&gt; Akon and Wyclef Jean also later joined the set during the last lap of shoot in Los Angeles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://allafricancinema.com/wyclef-jean-and-akon-will-star-in-jeta-amatas-nollywood-production-black-november/ | title=

===Filming===
The movie was initially a U$300,000 project to raise consciousness on the oil spills and put an end to the poor treatment of Nigerians affected. As bigger challenges came up, changes were made, which led to the project taking up to US$16 million on production.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;  The amount for production and marketing of the film totalled at approximately US$22million.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;&lt;ref name="All African cinemas"/&gt; Filming was done on location in the [[Niger Delta]] region and [[Los Angeles]], [[California]]. Parts of the film were also shot in [[Makurdi]].&lt;ref name="movieweb" /&gt; The film was produced by Wells and Jeta Entertainment, in conjunction with Rock City Entertainment, and Starkid Inc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nollywoodwatch.com/black-gold-struggle-niger-delta/ | title=Black Gold: Struggle for the Niger Delta | publisher=Nollywood Watch | date=18 February 2011 | accessdate=25 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A death threat was sent to the lead actor, [[Mbong Amata]], during the course of making the film in 2011. The source of the threat still remains unknown, but was deduced to be from either a militant group or an oil company. There was a period during filming when some production equipment coming from overseas was seized by the [[Nigerian Customs Service]]. The cast of the film had to remain idle in their hotel for a week, while the equipment awaited customs' clearance.&lt;ref name="All African cinemas"/&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated5 /&gt; The film's visual effects were supervised by former [[Industrial Light &amp; Magic]] animator [[Wes Takahashi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.agni-animation.com/fullerton/halloffame/Wes_Ford_Takahashi.html|title=Subject: Wes Ford Takahashi|publisher=Animators' Hall of Fame|access-date=14 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==

===Critical reception===
''Black November'' received mixed to negative reviews. It currently has 25% rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]], with an aggregate score of 3.9 out of 10, from twelve critics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/black_november/ | title=Black November | accessdate=14 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has a 31 score on [[Metacritic]], which indicates a "generally unfavorable reviews".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/black-november | title=Black November | publisher=Metacritic | accessdate=14 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has a 67% rating on [[Nollywood Reinvented]] which says the film "strikes immediately as an emotionally compelling story that brings to the forefront a highly relevant political issue". It however talked down on the character development and concluded by stating: "''Black November'' was a brilliant work of cinematography with an engaging and cohesive storyline that could have done with a little more character development for the protagonist". The website however noted Mbong Amata's performance as her "most convincing performance till date".&lt;ref name="NR"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nollywoodreinvented.com/2014/07/black-november.html | title=Black November - Nollywood Reinvented | publisher=[[Nollywood Reinvented]] | work=Nollywood Reinvented | date=11 July 2014 | accessdate=2 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Africa Report]]'' states; "''Black November'' is not perfect, but it's good". Mbong Amata's performance is described as "impressive" and it concluded by saying; "It [''Black November''] is a moving, enraging, chilling, kick-ass adventure story about greed, brutality and injustice".&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; [[Toni Kan]] on [[Nigerian Entertainment Today]] comments that the film has a good story, but Amata "misses the plot". He panned the performances from the actors and concludes: "''Black November'' attempts to be many things all at once; it is both advocacy and propaganda, Nollywood and Hollywood but it fails woefully in becoming something of character and substance. Jeta Amata has made what should have been a very important movie, but he totally mis-handles the opportunity. Which is a damn shame!".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://thenet.ng/2015/02/jeta-amata-misses-the-plot-in-black-november-by-toni-kan/ | title=Jeta Amata misses the plot in ‘Black November’ | work=The NET NG | date=8 February 2015 | accessdate=14 March 2015 | author=Kan, Toni}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nicolas Rapold of ''[[The New York Times]]'' concludes: "Mr. Amata retains the emphatic Nollywood acting style, which almost becomes a form of agitprop. Every other conversation feels as if conducted at or beyond the pitch of an argument. Violence isn’t held back. Mr. Amata also reserves some disdain for his compatriots. There’s a go-for-broke vigor to the way Mr. Amata cuts to the conflict in most scenes, but the heavy-handedness across the board imposes some significant limitations. Mr. Amata, though, pulls no punches with his ending".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/09/movies/black-november-delves-into-an-african-oil-disaster.html?_r=0 | title=‘Black November’ Delves Into an African Oil Disaster | work=The New York Times | date=8 January 2015 | accessdate=14 March 2015 | author=Rapold, Nicolas}}&lt;/ref&gt; Martin Tsai of ''[[The Los Angeles Times]]'' comments: "''Black November'' dramatizes the outfit's mission, enemies and tactics almost in bullet-point form, eschewing any complexities in its onslaught. Jeta Amata always seems overreaching for the right buttons to push, [as] the filmmaker has trouble developing scenes, characters and plots".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-mn-black-november-movie-review-20150113-story.html | title=Well-intentioned 'Black November' tends to overreach |work=LA Times | date=9 January 2015 | accessdate=13 March 2015 | author=Tsai, Martin}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Frank Scheck]] of ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' concludes: "Filled with declamatory speeches, stereotypical characters and heavily telegraphed, melodramatic plot developments, the film fails to work as either thriller or politically themed drama. Unfortunately, it will take a far stronger effort than ''Black November'' to provoke greater interest".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/black-november-film-review-761561 | title='Black November': Film Review | work=The Hollywood Reporter | date=7 January 2015 | accessdate=14 March 2015 | author=Scheck, Frank}}&lt;/ref&gt; Guy Lodge of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' concludes: "while the presence upfront of Kim Basinger and Mickey Rourke lends the initial impression of cheerfully cheesy exploitation fare, their contributions turn out to be marginal: Auds [Audience] chasing cheap thrills will be caught off guard by this earnestly angry study of Nigeria’s corruption-riddled oil industry, superficially bracketed by a standard-issue, Los Angeles-set hostage drama. Sadly, Jeta Amata’s film proves plodding and sanctimonious in either register".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://variety.com/2015/film/reviews/film-review-black-november-1201396672/ | title=Film Review: ‘Black November’ |work=Variety | date=2015 | accessdate=14 March 2015 | author=Lodge, Guy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Response===
''Black November'' has had significant impact; Amata and associate producer Lorenzo Omo-Aligbe were invited to the White House regarding the film; Congressman [[Bobby Rush]] and his Republican colleague [[Jeff Fortenberry]] were so affected by the film that they sponsored a joint resolution aimed at pressurizing the Nigerian government and Western oil companies to clean up spills in the Niger Delta.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;&lt;ref name="All African cinemas"/&gt;

==Themes==
Fatima Sesay of ''[[Sahara Reporters]]'' states; "''Black November'' narrates the true story of the corruption and greedy tactics used by multi-national oil corporations and the Nigerian government to hide the truth about the oils spills in the Niger Delta, while making a large sum of money from exporting what really belongs to the Nigerian citizens.  Sadly, the people most affected by the spills get rewarded not even a penny for their agony".&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt; Amata stated in an interview that the purpose of the film is to "bring to light the injustice and inhumane situation of the Niger Delta", he also said "If [[BP]] can be made to compensate the people of the Gulf of Mexico, why can't the world make the oil companies polluting our land make amends? We have been suffering spills the size of [[Exxon Valdez oil spill|Exxon Valdez]] for 50 years, yet no one talks about it, as long as they benefit from the oil."&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;&lt;ref name="All African cinemas"/&gt; The producer of the film Dede Mabiaku says ''Black November'' is "an eye-opening movie with a cause" which he says should be able to encourage people to fight for the immediate clean-up of the Niger Delta.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt; [[The Guardian]] states; "Amata's film is weighing into the 50-year history of western exploitation of the delta's oil resources, local collusion and violent resistance to it".

==Historical references and accuracy==
{{Further|Conflict in the Niger Delta|Ken Saro-Wiwa}}
For more than 50 years, there were oil spills every year in the Niger Delta, with nothing done to prevent new spills. The contamination was never cleaned, thereby leaving the water undrinkable, the lands infertile and causing the death of wildlife and aquatic lives. The conditions were compared to the [[Exxon Valdez oil spill|BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;

[[Ken Saro-Wiwa]], a writer hailing from [[Ogoni people|Ogoniland]] of the [[Niger Delta]], was a regular critic of the Nigerian Government. In the 1990s, he led many protests, fighting for the Niger Delta oil pollution to be cleaned up and well maintained. He was one of the pioneers of the "[[Movement for the Survival of the Ogoni People]] (MOSOP)". Many of the Delta protests led by Saro-Wiwa targeted oil giant company [[Royal Dutch Shell]], who was a major player in the Nigerian oil business at the time. In 1995, Saro-Wiwa along with nine other environmentalists were arrested and executed by the then military dictatorship Government of [[Sani Abacha]]. The news generated international outrage, leading to the suspension of Nigeria from the British Commonwealth until 1999.

As of 2006, the situation in Ogoniland has eased significantly, assisted by the transition to democratic rule in 1999. However, no attempts were made by the government or an international body to bring about justice by investigating and prosecuting those involved in the violence and property destruction that have occurred in Ogoniland.&lt;ref name=HRW02&gt;[https://www.hrw.org/reports/2002/nigeria3/nigerdelta.pdf THE NIGER DELTA: NO DEMOCRATIC DIVIDEND] (Human Rights Watch, 2002)&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Royal Dutch Shell]] was sued by families of the activists, who accused the company of complicity in the deaths. The company said it never advocated any act of violence against the activists and tried to persuade the government to grant clemency. In 2009, the company agreed to an out-of-court settlement with the families, paying them US$15.5 million.&lt;ref name=autogenerated6 /&gt;

In 2009, the Nigerian Government granted [[Amnesty]] and an unconditional pardon to Militants in the [[Niger Delta]], which lasted for 60 days, starting 6 August 2009 and ending 4 October 2009. During the 60-day period armed youths surrendered their weapons to the Government in return for training and rehabilitation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/8118314.stm |title=Africa &amp;#124; Nigeria offers militants amnesty |publisher=BBC News |date=26 June 2009 |accessdate=23 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Government also launched a programme tagged: "Niger Delta Youth Empowerment Project (YEP)" which aimed to take care of Job Creation, Conflict Prevention Initiatives, technical/vocational skills acquisition, reduction in the level of poverty and stimulation of sustainable development in the Niger Delta. YEP was established as a direct response to the recurrent youth conflicts in the Niger Delta at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.ng.undp.org/content/nigeria/en/home/operations/projects/poverty_reduction/yep/| title=Niger Delta Youth Empowerment: What is the project about?| publisher=UNDP Nigeria| work=| accessdate=2 August 2014| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140808042155/http://www.ng.undp.org/content/nigeria/en/home/operations/projects/poverty_reduction/yep/| archive-date=2014-08-08| dead-url=yes| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Brigandage in Southern Italy''' had existed in some form since ancient times. However its origins as [[outlaw]]s targeting random travellers would evolve vastly later on in the form of the political [[resistance movement]]. During the time of the [[Napoleonic]] conquest of the [[Kingdom of Naples]], the first signs of political resistance [[brigandage]] came to public light, as the [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon]] loyalists of the country refused to accept the new Bonapartist rulers and actively fought against them until the Bourbon monarchy had been reinstated.&lt;ref name="mein"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mein-italien.info/geschichte/briganten.htm|publisher=Mein-Italien.info|title= Briganten in Süditalien (i briganti)|date=16 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some claim that the word brigandage is a euphemism for what was in fact a civil war.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=YJBoAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=history+of+modern+sicily+smith&amp;dq=history+of+modern+sicily+smith|title=A History of Sicily: Modern Sicily, after 1713, by D.M.

==History==
[[Image:Briganti 1862 from Bisaccia.jpg|thumb|225px|left|A small band of brigands from [[Bisaccia]], photographed in 1862]]
In the upheaval of Sicily's transition out of [[feudalism]] in 1812, and the resulting lack of an effective government police force banditry became a serious problem in much of rural Sicily during the 19th century.&lt;ref name=sardell&gt;Jason Sardell, [http://www.wpi.edu/Pubs/E-project/Available/E-project-031609-103313/unrestricted/JSardellMafia.pdf Economic Origins of the Mafia and Patronage System in Sicily], Worcester Polytechnic Institute, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Rising food prices, the loss of public and church lands, and the loss of feudal [[common rights]] pushed many desperate peasants to banditry.&lt;ref name=sardell/&gt;&lt;ref name=bandiera&gt;[[Oriana Bandiera]], [http://econ.lse.ac.uk/staff/bandiera/mafia1101.pdf Private States and the Enforcement of Property Rights: Theory and evidence on the origins of the Sicilian mafia] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120319025549/http://econ.lse.ac.uk/staff/bandiera/mafia1101.pdf |date=2012-03-19 }}, London School of Economics and CEPR, 2001, pp. 8-10&lt;/ref&gt;

With no police to call upon, local elites in countryside towns recruited young men into "companies-at-arms" to hunt down thieves and negotiate the return of stolen property, in exchange for a pardon for the thieves and a fee from the victims, a development that is often seen as the genesis of the [[Sicilian Mafia|Mafia]].&lt;ref name=lupo34&gt;Lupo, ''History of the Mafia'', p. 34&lt;/ref&gt; These companies-at-arms were often made up of former bandits and criminals, usually the most skilled and violent of them.&lt;ref name=bandiera/&gt; While this saved communities the trouble of maintaining their own policemen, this may have made the companies-at-arms more inclined to collude with their former brethren rather than destroy them.&lt;ref name=bandiera/&gt;

After the [[Italian unification|conquest of the Kingdom of Two Sicilies]] in 1861 by the [[Kingdom of Sardinia]] (later [[Kingdom of Italy]]), the most famous and well known form of brigandage in the area emerged.&lt;ref&gt;Ilaria Porciani, "On the Uses and Abuses of Nationalism from Below: A Few Notes on Italy", in [[Maarten Van Ginderachter]] and {{Interlanguage link multi|Marnix Beyen|nl}} (eds.), ''Nationhood from Below: Europe in the Long Nineteenth Century'' (London: Palgrave Macmillan2012), p. 75: "the so-called ''Brigantaggio'' (1860–1870)".&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Marxism|Marxist]] theoretician Nicola Zitara, social unrest, especially among the lower classes, occurred due to poor conditions, and the fact that the [[Risorgimento]] benefited in the "[[Mezzogiorno]]" only the [[bourgeoisie]] vast-land owning classes.&lt;ref name="mein"/&gt;  Many turned to brigandage in the [[mountain]]s of [[Basilicata]], [[Campania]], [[Calabria]] and [[Abruzzo]], but the brigands were not a homogeneous group, nor did they operate with any common cause. Amongst the brigands were a mixture of people, with different working backgrounds and motives; the brigands included former prisoners, bandits and other people who the Italian government regarded as common criminals, but also former soldiers and loyalists of the Bourbon army, as well as foreign mercenaries in the pay of the [[Francis II of the Two Sicilies|Bourbon king in exile]], some [[Nobility of Italy|nobles]], poverty stricken farmers and peasants who wanted [[land reforms]]: both men and women took up arms.&lt;ref name="mein"/&gt;

[[File:Briganti Volonnino.JPG|left|thumb|225px|Executed ''Briganti'']]
They launched attacks not only against the Italian authorities and the land owning upper-classes, but also against common people&lt;ref name=Brigandage&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yIwfXp2DEpEC|title=Brigandage in South Italy, by David Hilton Wheeler, Volume 2.|last=Hilton Wheeler|first=David|publisher=Sampson Low, Son, and Marston|year=1864|location=London|pages=294|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;, frequently looting villages, towns and farms, and committing armed robberies against both individuals and groups, including farmers, townspeople and rival brigand bands.&lt;ref name="Brigandage"/&gt; Robberies by brigand bands were often accompanied by other acts of violence and vandalism, such as arsons, murders, rapes, kidnappings, extortions and crop burnings.&lt;ref name="Brigandage"/&gt;

In 1863, an extremely strong handed repression of the brigands by the Italian authorities picked up, especially with the passing of the ''Pica Laws'', which permitted the arrest of relatives and those suspected of collaborating or helping a brigand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.polyarchy.org/basta/documenti/pica.1863.html|publisher=Polyarchy.org|title=Legge Pica (1863)|date=16 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The villages of [[Pontelandolfo]] and [[Casalduni]] in the [[Province of Benevento]] became the site of a massacre of thirteen brigands by Italian [[Bersaglieri]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Desiderio|first=Giancristano|date=August 8, 2016|title=Pontelandolfo, una lettera inedita del 1861: "Perirono 13 persone"''|publisher=sanniopress.it|url=http://www.sanniopress.it/2016/08/08/pontelandolfo-una-lettera-inedita-del-1861-perirono-13-persone}}&lt;/ref&gt; conducted as a reprisal following the massacre of forty-five soldiers of the [[Italian Royal Army|Italian army]] by local brigands.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.corriere.it/cultura/speciali/2010/visioni-d-italia/notizie/32-stella-rizzo-pontelandolfo-roghi-400-morti_83544b90-c60e-11df-89af-00144f02aabe.shtml|publisher=www.corriere.it|author=Sergio Rizzo, Gian Antonio Stella|title=Il rogo delle case e 400 morti che nessuno vuole ricordare}}&lt;/ref&gt; In total several thousand brigands were arrested and [[executed]], while many more were [[deported]] or fled the country (see [[Italian diaspora]]).&lt;ref name="mein"/&gt; In Palermo in 1866, 40,000 Italian soldiers were needed to put down [[The Seven and a Half Days Revolt]].

After the Italian Unification in 1861, unlike Southern Italy, brigandage was virtually non-existent in the other annexed states of northern and central Italy such as: [[Kingdom of Lombardy-Venetia]], [[Duchy of Parma]], [[Duchy of Modena]], [[Grand Duchy of Tuscany]], [[Papal States]], because the situation of Southern Italy was very different, owing to the previous centuries of history and the Italian southern historian and politician [[Francesco Saverio Nitti]],  describes how brigandage was endemic in Southern Italy already before 1860, using the following words from his book ''Eroi e briganti'' (Heroes and brigands),&lt;ref&gt;''Eroi e briganti'' (Heroes and brigands) by Francesco Saverio Nitti - (edition 1899) – Osanna Edizioni 2015 - {{ISBN|8881674696}}, 9788881674695 - page 33&lt;/ref&gt; translated into English: &lt;blockquote&gt;«'' … every part of Europe has had brigands and criminals, that in war and misfortune time dominated the countryside, and put themselves out of the law […] but there was only one country in Europe where brigandage has existed we can say always […] a country where brigandage for many centuries can look like a huge river of blood and hates […] a country where for centuries monarchy based itself on brigandage, that became like a historical agent: this is the country of Midday » &lt;small&gt;(from Italian “Mezzodì” or “Mezzogiorno” to mean the South of Italy, here referred to XIXth century) &lt;/small&gt;''. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

In relation to the thesis which regards brigandage in southern Italy as a popular revolt against [[Risorgimento|Italian unification]] or the [[House of Savoy]], it is to be observed that after 1865-1870, when brigandage in the South ended, it was never followed up by any anti-Savoy or anti-unification movement. Many southern Italians held high positions in the new Italian government, such as the 11th Prime Minister of Italy [[Francesco Crispi]]. Italians from southern Italy would also go on to play a key role in the ultra-nationalist [[Italian Fascism|Fascist movement]], most notably the so-called 'philosopher of Fascism' [[Giovanni Gentile]]. The thesis which regards the South as hostile to Savoy after the unification also does not explain the fact that with the birth of the [[Italian Republic]], after the referendum of June 2, 1946, the south voted overwhelmingly in favor of the Savoy monarchy, while the north voted for a republic, and from 1946 to 1972 the monarchist parties (which merged into the [[Italian Democratic Party of Monarchist Unity]]) gained acclaim especially in the South and in Naples (a city in which nearly 80% supported the Savoy monarchy).&lt;ref&gt;Of 1,145,624 valid votes, 903,651 (79%) were monarchist and 241,973 republican (21%)(See page 234 Istat data, in Franco Malnati, ''La grande frode. Come l'Italia fu fatta Repubblica'', Bastogi Collana De Monarchica, Bari, 1998,&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Cambridge Science Festival''' is a series of events typically held annually in March in [[Cambridge]], [[England]] and is the United Kingdom's largest free [[science festival]].&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{cite web|title=University of Cambridge Science Festival 2011|publisher=BBC News|url=http://bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-cambridgeshire-12759607|accessdate=21 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The festival attracts more than 30,000 visitors to over 250 events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About - www.sciencefestival.cam.ac.uk|url=http://www.sciencefestival.cam.ac.uk/about|accessdate=21 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; University researches and students open their lecture halls and laboratories to the general public, and hold Talks, Exhibitions and Demonstrations, mostly free of charge.&lt;ref name="bbc" /&gt;

Started in 1994 by scientists of the [[University of Cambridge]] and backed by local businesses, the festival was inspired by ''National Science Week'' and is aimed making science and engineering more accessible, showcasing research performed at Cambridge University, and encouraging young people to pursue careers in engineering and science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Two exciting decades of scientific fun and games|publisher=Cambridge News|url=http://cambridge-news.co.uk/exciting-decades-scientific-fun-games/story-22498061-detail/story.html|accessdate=21 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=21st Cambridge Science Festival hopes to inspire the next generation of scientists|publisher=Anglia - ITV News|url=http://itv.com/news/anglia/update/2015-03-10/21st-cambridge-science-festival-hopes-to-inspire-the-next-generation-of-scientists|accessdate=21 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 21st festival ran from 9 to 22 March 2015 and featured themes based on light science and technology to mark [[UNESCO]]'s ''[[International Year of Light]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Reaching out in the International Year of Light|url=http://optics.org/news/6/3/1|accessdate=21 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During planning for its extended missions, various future plans for ''Cassini'' were evaluated on the basis of scientific value, cost, and time.&lt;ref name="spilker" /&gt;&lt;ref name="usra_0903"&gt;{{cite web | last1=Pappalardo | first1=Bob | last2=Spilker | first2=Linda | url=http://www.lpi.usra.edu/opag/march09/presentations/pappalardo.pdf | format=PDF | title=Cassini Proposed Extended-Extended Mission (XXM) | work= | publisher=Lunar and Planetary Institute | date=March 15, 2009 | deadurl=no | archivedate=July 18, 2012 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120718145449/http://www.lpi.usra.edu/opag/march09/presentations/pappalardo.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the options examined included collision with Saturn atmosphere, an icy satellite, or rings; another was departure from [[Saturn]] orbit to [[Jupiter]], [[Uranus]], [[Neptune]], or a [[Centaur (minor planet)|centaur]].&lt;ref name="spilker" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Okutsu, Masataka, et al.

==Atmospheric entry and destruction==
[[Image:Cassini's Final Image.png|thumb|150px|right|Last image taken by ''Cassini'', at 19:59 UTC ({{date|September 14, 2017}}).]]
On July 4, 2014, the ''Cassini'' science team announced that the proximal orbits of the probe would be named the "Grand Finale".&lt;ref name="Grand"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/mission/grand-finale/overview/ |title=The Grand Finale Toolkit |website=[[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]] |access-date=2017-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; This would be immediately preceded by a gradual shift in inclination to better view [[Saturn's hexagon|Saturn's polar hexagon]], and a flyby of [[Enceladus]] to more closely study its [[cryovolcano|cryovolcanism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.astrobio.net/topic/solar-system/saturn/cassini-names-final-mission-phase-grand-finale/ |title=Cassini Names Final Mission Phase Its 'Grand Finale' |work=Astrobiology Magazine |date=July 4, 2014 |accessdate=2015-08-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed by a dive into Saturn's atmosphere.&lt;ref name="Grand"/&gt; 

Scientific data was collected using eight of its twelve science instruments. All of the probe's magnetosphere and plasma science instruments, plus the spacecraft's radio science system, and its infrared and ultraviolet spectrometers collected data during the final plunge.  The data rates flowing back from Saturn could not support imaging during the final plunge, so all pictures were downlinked prior to the spacecraft disposal.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-41262984 Cassini conducts last picture show]. Jonathan Amos. ''BBC News''. 14 September 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; The predicted altitude for loss of signal was approximately {{convert|1500|km|mi|abbr=on}} above Saturn's cloud tops, when the spacecraft began to tumble and burn up like a meteor.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=6945 Cassini Spacecraft Makes Its Final Approach to Saturn]. JPL, NASA News. September 13, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==
===Bob Menendez===
Johnson was involved in the creation of a ''[[The Daily Caller|Daily Caller]]'' story that accused U.S. Senator [[Bob Menendez]] ([[Democratic Party (United States)|D]]-[[New Jersey|NJ]]) [[Bob Menendez#Federal Investigations of Menendez|of soliciting underage prostitutes]] in the [[Dominican Republic]].&lt;ref name=DailyCaller&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dailycaller.com/2012/11/01/women-sen-bob-menendez-paid-us-for-sex-in-the-dominican-republic/ |title=Women: Sen.

===Cory Booker===
On October 14, 2013, Johnson published an article on ''The Daily Caller'' claiming that [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark]] mayor and [[United States Senate|senatorial]] candidate [[Cory Booker]] never lived in Newark, citing neighbors of Booker's alleged address as evidence.&lt;ref name=Booker&gt;{{cite web|author=Charles C.

According to Booker's campaign he lived there from late 2006 to shortly before he was elected Senator in 2013. Johnson stands by his reporting, claiming that Booker may well have paid rent but did not live in Newark.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cramer|first1=Ruby|title=Cory Booker: Yes, I Live In Newark|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/rubycramer/cory-booker-yes-i-live-in-newark|accessdate=June 10, 2016|work=Buzzfeed|date=October 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Weigel |first=David |url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/weigel/2013/10/15/birther_director_claims_that_cory_booker_does_not_live_in_newark.html |title=Birther director claims Cory Booker does not live in Newark |publisher=Slate.com |date=2013-10-15 |accessdate=2015-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===David D. Kirkpatrick===
In January 2014, Johnson published an article reporting that ''New York Times'' reporter [[David D. Kirkpatrick]]  was arrested for exhibitionism and had previously posed for ''[[Playgirl]]''.&lt;ref name=Kirkpatrick&gt;{{cite web|author=Charles C. JohnsonContributor |url=http://dailycaller.com/2014/01/03/benghazi-reporter-kirkpatrick-showed-his-naked-body-to-all-in-college/ |title=Benghazi reporter Kirkpatrick went nude constantly |publisher=The Daily Caller |date= |accessdate=2015-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Johnson's source for the ''Playgirl'' claim was a January 22, 1990, article in ''[[The Daily Princetonian]]'', which was later revealed to be satirical.&lt;ref name=slate2&gt;{{cite web|last=Weigel |first=David |url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/weigel/2014/01/06/daily_caller_cites_24_year_old_fake_princeton_newspaper_to_attack_the_nyt.html |title=Daily Caller's Charles C.

===2014 Mississippi Republican primary election===
On June 30, 2014, Johnson published a story on GotNews accusing [[Mississippi]] senator [[Thad Cochran]] of bribing [[African-Americans]] to vote for him in the [[United States Senate Republican primary election in Mississippi, 2014|Mississippi Senate Republican primary]].&lt;ref name=BI&gt;{{cite web|author=Politics |url=http://www.businessinsider.com/charles-johnson-mississippi-senate-race-mcdaniel-cochran-2014-7 |title=Charles Johnson And The Mississippi Senate Race |publisher=Business Insider |date=2014-07-11 |accessdate=2015-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The story came days after Cochran had defeated [[Tea Party movement|Tea Party]] challenger [[Chris McDaniel]] in a run-off election. Johnson claimed that a Black pastor named Stevie Fielder had told him he was paid by Cochran's campaign to bribe Black Democrats into voting for Cochran. Johnson paid the pastor for his statements, a controversial practice sometimes known as "[[Chequebook journalism|checkbook journalism]]".&lt;ref name=BI /&gt; Fielder later partially recanted his story, saying that he had been speaking hypothetically, that he had turned down the offer, and that Johnson's recording of his interview had been selectively edited, a claim Johnson denies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Pender|first1=Geoff|title=Meridian man dials back vote-buying claim|url=http://www.clarionledger.com/story/politicalledger/2014/07/10/fielder-votes-buying-election-cochran-mcdaniel/12500655/|accessdate=September 5, 2015|work=The Clarion-Ledger|date=July 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the election, Johnson also accused the Cochran campaign of being responsible for Mississippi Tea Party leader Mark Mayfield's suicide and encouraged his Twitter followers to flood a Cochran campaign [[conference call]].&lt;ref name=BI /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cogan|first1=Marin|title=Ugly: The aftershocks of a tea-party suicide|url=http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2015/06/mark-mayfield-tea-party-suicide.html|accessdate=September 5, 2015|work=New York Magazine|date=June 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ferguson===
During the [[Ferguson unrest]], Johnson published the [[Instagram]] account of shooting victim [[Shooting of Michael Brown|Michael Brown]] and stated that the account "shows a violent streak that may help explain what led to a violent confrontation with Police officer Darren Wilson".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wilstein|first1=Matt|title=Conservative Blogger Tries to Prove ‘Violent Streak’ with Michael Brown’s Photos|url=http://www.mediaite.com/online/conservative-blogger-tries-to-prove-violent-streak-with-michael-browns-instagram-photos/|accessdate=September 5, 2015|work=Mediaite|date=September 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Johnson also filed a lawsuit to have Brown's juvenile records released. In Brown's home state of Missouri, the records of minors are private, but Johnson argued that the matter was of pressing public interest under the state's [[Freedom of information in the United States|sunshine law]]. The county court disagreed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Zara|first1=Christopher|title=Mike Brown Juvenile Record? Lawsuit Seeks Alleged Arrest History Of Slain Missouri Teen|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/mike-brown-juvenile-record-lawsuit-seeks-alleged-arrest-history-slain-missouri-teen-1672574|accessdate=September 5, 2015|work=International Business Times|date=August 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further appeal attempts by Johnson to unseal the records went as far as the State Supreme Court of Missouri, which denied his request.

In a separate incident during the unrest, Johnson published the addresses of two ''New York Times'' reporters, claiming that they published the known addresses of [[Darren Wilson (police officer)|Darren Wilson]].&lt;ref name=NYT /&gt; ''The New York Times'' has said the reporters only revealed the street on which Wilson once lived.&lt;ref name=NYT /&gt;

===University of Virginia rape article===
In December 2014, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' columnist [[Sabrina Erdely]] published an article entitled "[[A Rape on Campus]]" about the alleged gang rape of a [[University of Virginia]] (UVA) student named "Jackie" in 2012 at the [[Phi Kappa Psi]] fraternity house at UVA. The article was later found to be fabricated.&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/15/business/media/sowing-mayhem-one-click-at-a-time.html&lt;/ref&gt; Johnson publicly identified a woman he thought was Jackie,&lt;ref name=DD&gt;{{cite web|last=Howell |first=Patrick |url=http://www.dailydot.com/news/charles-johnson-uva-jackie-dox/ |title=Journalist publishes alleged name and photo of UVA rape victim |publisher=Dailydot.com |date=2014-12-07 |accessdate=2015-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; which has since been proven to be false.&lt;ref name="Forbes"/&gt;

===Banning from Twitter===
On May 24, 2015, Johnson sent a tweet asking his followers for donations to help him "take out" [[Black Lives Matter]] activist [[Deray McKesson]]. McKesson shared the tweet and took the tweet as a threat. Johnson was permanently [[List of people banned from Twitter|banned from Twitter]] after several users reported him for harassment.&lt;ref name="Slate"/&gt; In 2018, Johnson sued Twitter for banning him on the grounds that Twitter violated his [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] right to free speech. The California Superior Court in Fresno struck down Johnson's lawsuit on June 6.&lt;ref&gt;Thomsen, Jacqueline (6 June 2018) [http://thehill.com/policy/technology/technology/391096-court-strikes-down-far-right-activists-lawsuit-over-twitter-ban "Court strikes down far-right activist's lawsuit over Twitter ban."] The Hill. (Retrieved 7 June 2018.)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Katie Walsh ===
In February 2017, Johnson's website GotNews.com claimed that deputy chief of staff [[Katie Walsh (politician)|Katie Walsh]] was “the source behind a bunch of leaks” in the White House without offering any concrete evidence.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.politico.com/story/2017/05/15/donald-trump-fake-news-238379|title=How Trump gets his fake news|work=POLITICO|access-date=2017-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Charlottesville Rally ===
In August 2017, Johnson's website GotNews falsely accused a Michigan man of being responsible for [[2017 Unite the Right rally#Vehicular ramming into counterprotesters|the car attack]] on 12 August 2017 that killed and injured anti-racist protesters in [[Charlottesville, Virginia]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/alt-right-media-framed-wrong-person-in-car-attack-labeled-him-anti-trump-druggie|title=Alt-Right Media Framed Wrong Person in Car Attack, Labeled Him ‘Anti-Trump Druggie’|last=Collins|first=Ben|date=2017-08-13|website=The Daily Beast|access-date=2017-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Michigan man was subsequently harassed, and was advised by police to flee his home following a slew of death threats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Darcy |first1=Oliver |title=Man misidentified as Charlottesville driver had to flee home; plans to sue far-right sites |url=https://money.cnn.com/2017/08/16/media/charlottesville-man-misidentified-plans-lawsuit/index.html |accessdate=August 2, 2018 |work=CNNMoney |date=August 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Together with his father, the Michigan man filed a defamation lawsuit against 22 corporate and individual defendants, including Johnson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Palma |first1=Bethania |title=GotNews and Other Disreputable Sites Sued for Naming Innocent Teen as the Charlottesville Killer |url=https://www.snopes.com/news/2018/02/17/gotnews-disreputable-sites-sued-naming-innocent-teen-charlottesville-killer/ |accessdate=August 2, 2018 |work=Snopes.com |date=February 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.courthousenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/CharlottesvilleGotNews.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; On June 1, 2018, Johnson and GotNews agreed to pay $25,000 to settle the lawsuit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Barrouquere |first1=Brett |title=Costly Hate |url=https://www.splcenter.org/hatewatch/2018/06/08/costly-hate |accessdate=August 2, 2018 |work=Hatewatch |publisher=[[Southern Poverty Law Center]] |date=June 8, 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Trump campaign WikiLeaks liaison ===
In September 2016, Johnson published a story on GotNews about a soon-to-launch anti-Trump website called PutinTrump.org.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Johnson |first1=Charles C. |title=BREAKING: George Soros-Tied Group Launching Trump-Russia Conspiracy Theory Website |url=http://gotnews.com/breaking-george-soros-tied-group-launching-trump-russia-conspiracy-theory-website/ |accessdate=September 21, 2018 |work=GotNews.com |date=September 21, 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160922001139/http://gotnews.com/breaking-george-soros-tied-group-launching-trump-russia-conspiracy-theory-website/ |archivedate=September 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Trump campaign–Russian meetings|WikiLeaks]] forwarded the story in private to [[Donald Trump Jr.]] before publicly tweeting it. ''[[Business Insider]]'' speculated that Johnson's story in September on GotNews may have marked the beginning of Donald Trump Jr.'s—and the Trump campaign's—back-channel contact with [[Julian Assange]] and Wikileaks. (Johnson wrote after Wikileaks tweeted the story, "About 2 hours after our original article, Julian Assange's WikiLeaks repeated our discoveries. Guess which big leaks organization reads GotNews &amp; WeSearchr on the downlow! Come on Julian, let's work together. WikiLeaks &amp; WeSearchr is a match made in heaven. We can take down Hillary together.")&lt;ref&gt;Bertrand, Natasha (November 15, 2017) [http://www.businessinsider.com/wikileaks-donald-trump-jr-charles-johnson-2017-11 "A notorious far-right blogger may have provoked WikiLeaks' outreach to Donald Trump Jr."] ''Business Insider''. (Retrieved November 11, 2017.)&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2017, Johnson brokered and attended a meeting in London between GOP Rep. [[Dana Rohrabacher]] and Julian Assange to discuss a presidential pardon for Assange.&lt;ref&gt;Mai-Duc, Christine (August 17, 2017) [http://www.latimes.com/politics/essential/la-pol-ca-essential-politics-updates-right-wing-blogger-charles-c-johnson-1502992726-htmlstory.html "Rohrabacher on meeting with WikiLeaks’ Assange: We talked about 'what might be necessary to get him out.'"] ''Los Angeles Times''. (Retrieved November 16, 2017.)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fraudulent sexual harassment claim against Senator Charles Schumer===
On December 11, 2017 Johnson wrote on his [[Facebook]] page, “[[Mike Cernovich|Michael Cernovich]] &amp; I are going to end the career of a U.S. Senator.” Johnson claimed to have uncovered a sexual harassment lawsuit against Senator [[Charles Schumer]].  The lawsuit, however, turned out to be a forgery. Moreover, language in the forged lawsuit was copied verbatim from a real sexual-harassment complaint filed against Rep. [[John Conyers]]. Schumer referred the matter to [[United States Capitol Police|Capitol police]] for investigation.&lt;ref&gt;Sullivan, Eileen (December 13, 2017) [https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/13/us/politics/schumer-fraudulent-document-harassment.html “Schumer Files Police Report After Fraudulent Document Emerges.”] New York Times.

(Retrieved March 6, 2018.)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Denunciation by Anti-Defamation League ===
Johnson attended President Donald Trump's [[2018 State of the Union Address]] as a guest of Rep. [[Matt Gaetz|Matthew Gaetz]] of Florida. In a letter to Gaetz, the national director of the [[Anti-Defamation League]] urged Gaetz to "discontinue any association with Johnson and to publicly repudiate his views immediately." The letter noted that Johnson's website WeSearchr raised more than $150,000 for the legal defense of neo-Nazi propagandist [[The Daily Stormer#Andrew Anglin|Andrew Anglin]] and that Johnson has written that he agrees with notorious Holocaust denier [[David Cole (journalist)|David Cole]] "about Auschwitz and the gas chambers not being real."&lt;ref&gt;Greenblatt, Jonathan A. (February 1, 2018) [https://www.adl.org/news/letters/adl-letter-to-congressman-matthew-gaetz-regarding-charles-johnson "ADL Letter to Congressman Matthew Gaetz Regarding Charles Johnson."] Anti-Defamation League.org.

==Books==
Johnson has written two books published through [[Encounter Books]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Charles C. Johnson - Encounter Books |url=https://www.encounterbooks.com/authors/charles-c-johnson/ |website=Encounter Books |accessdate=21 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Why Coolidge Matters'' (2013, {{isbn|1-59403-669-1}}); an essay collection encompassing various points in [[Calvin Coolidge]]'s political career,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/mar/14/book-review-why-coolidge-matters/|title=BOOK REVIEW: ‘Why Coolidge Matters’|last=http://www.washingtontimes.com|first=The Washington Times|work=The Washington Times|access-date=2018-09-16|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''The Truth About the IRS Scandals'' (2013, {{isbn|9781594037443}}; a book covering the [[IRS targeting controversy]] and alleging that the since-debunked assertion that the agency targeted primarily conservative and right-leaning groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newsweek.com/remember-irs-scandal-it-was-fake-news-all-along-681674|title=Remember the IRS Scandal?

==Gawker lawsuit==
In June 2015, Johnson sued [[Gawker]] for [[defamation]] in Missouri for $66 million for Gawker's publication of rumours that Johnson defecated on the floor while a student at Claremont McKenna College, and filed a similar suit in California in December.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/06/19/chuck-johnson-sues-gawker_n_7616756.html|title=Conservative Blogger Sues Gawker For $66 Million Over Public Pooping Rumors|first=Katie|last=Sola|date=June 19, 2015|work=[[Huffington Post]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In January 2016, the Missouri suit was dismissed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/blogger-s-defamation-lawsuit-tossed-out-of-missouri/article_1211e7ff-3971-5a5a-8f4a-0e79720af6fe.html|title=Blogger's defamation lawsuit tossed out — of Missouri|first=Robert|last=Patrick|date=January 15, 2016|work=[[St. Louis Post-Dispatch]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Websites (GotNews, WeSearchr, Freestartr)==
Johnson was the founder of three websites, all of which are defunct.

In early 2014, Johnson created GotNews, an alt-right news website.&lt;ref&gt;Murphy, Tim (December 6, 2014) [https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2014/12/charles-chuck-johnson-gotnews-rolling-stone/ "The Rise and Fall of Twitter’s Most Infamous Right-Wing Troll."] Mother Jones. (Retrieved October 1, 2018.)&lt;/ref&gt; The site closed on September 17, 2018.&lt;ref&gt;Barrouquere, Brett (September 19, 2018) [https://www.splcenter.org/hatewatch/2018/09/19/once-outlet-conspiracies-gotnewscom-now-shuttered-without-explanation "Once an outlet for conspiracies, GotNews.com now shuttered without explanation."] Southerner  Poverty Law Center. (Retrieved October 1, 2018].&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, Johnson created WeSearchr, a [[Crowdfunding|crowd-funding]] website. By 2017, the site became a fundraising platform for [[alt-right]] causes, though Johnson claimed that was not his intention. [[Neo-Nazism|Neo-Nazi]] Andrew Anglin, founder of ''[[The Daily Stormer]]'', used the website to raise money to defend himself against a lawsuit brought by the [[ACLU]] on behalf of a woman trolled by followers of Anglin.&lt;ref name="castillo"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Castillo |first1=Michelle |title=The far right uses this site to fund favorite causes, and its founder aims to be 'very profitable' |url=https://www.cnbc.com/2017/06/24/wesearchr-charles-johnson-alt-right-causes.html |accessdate=August 28, 2018 |work=CNBC |date=June 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to corwdfunding legal battles, the site was also designed to crowd-fund bounties on reporting goals. According to Johnson, he used the site to receive money for information he had already acquired.&lt;ref name=singal&gt;{{cite news |last1=Singal |first1=Jesse |title=Chuck Johnson's WeSearchr Is Having a Bit of a Meltdown |url=http://nymag.com/selectall/2017/05/chuck-johnsons-wesearchr-is-having-a-bit-of-a-meltdown.html |accessdate=August 28, 2018 |work=Select All |publisher=New York Magazine |date=May 16, 2017 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The site closed in May 2017.&lt;ref name=singal/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Lenz |first1=Ryan |title=One Year Later: Leaders from 'Unite the Right' Fall From Grace |url=https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/intelligence-report/2018/one-year-later-leaders-%E2%80%98unite-right%E2%80%99-fall-grace |accessdate=28 August 2018 |work=Intelligence Report |publisher=Southern Poverty Law Center |date=August 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Menegus |first1=Bryan |title=World's Worst Website Goes Down (Again) |url=https://gizmodo.com/worlds-worst-website-goes-down-again-1795266216 |accessdate=August 28, 2018 |work=Gizmodo |date=May 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Johnson also started the crowdfunding site Freestartr, which collected funds for white nationalist [[Richard B. Spencer]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Kirkland |first1=Allegra |title=After Struggle To Raise Funds, Spencer Finally Gets Lawyer In C’ville Case |url=https://talkingpointsmemo.com/muckraker/richard-spencer-manages-find-attorney-federal-charlottesville-case |accessdate=August 28, 2018 |work=Talking Points Memo |date=May 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; far-right activist [[Tommy Robinson (activist)|Tommy Robinson]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Dearden |first1=Lizzie |title=Tommy Robinson is richer and has more international support after two-month imprisonment, research shows |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/tommy-robinson-wealth-supporters-far-right-prison-freed-crime-a8473536.html |accessdate=August 28, 2018 |work=The Independent |date=August 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; white nationalist [[Faith Goldy]],&lt;ref name="sommer"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Sommer |first1=Will |title=Big Finance is Hitting the Far Right in the Wallet |url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/far-right-fuming-after-big-finance-chokes-off-money-flow |accessdate=August 28, 2018 |work=The Daily Beast |date=August 21, 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Johnson himself,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Guynn |first1=Jessica |title='Alt-right' escalates war against Silicon Valley, pledges to expose bias against conservatives |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2018/01/18/alt-right-escalates-war-against-silicon-valley-pledges-expose-bias-against-conservatives/1037524001/ |accessdate=August 28, 2018 |work=USA Today |date=January 18, 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and others. In mid-2018, Freestartr stopped accepting funds, as the site was banned by [[Stripe (company)|Stripe]] and [[Paypal]], which Freestartr used to process payments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Fisher |first1=Alyssa |title=Far-Right Organizations Get Banned From PayPal, Beg Followers For Help |url=https://forward.com/fast-forward/406567/far-right-organizations-get-banned-from-paypal-beg-followers-for-help/ |accessdate=August 28, 2018 |work=The Forward |date=July 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sommer"/&gt;

The '''Chautauqua Auditorium''', built in 1903, is a large historic [[icosagon]]al (20-sided) wooden [[chautauqua]] meeting hall located at Forest Park and North East 9th Street, [[Shelbyville, Illinois]], [[United States]]. On January 30, 1978, it was added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]].&lt;ref name="nris"&gt;{{NRISref|2009a}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is the largest building of its kind anywhere in the world. The building was constructed by a local bridge builder and designed with a unique system of structural support. Because of this, there are no interior pillars to block the view of the stage.

The large stage features three female Grecian statues representing Art, Music and Drama. These statues were works from renowned Illinois artist and Shelbyville native Robert Root.

In 2009 [[Landmarks Illinois]] declared it one of the 10 most endangered historic places in Illinois. The building is in need of extensive repairs which are estimated to cost $1,750,000. The city of Shelbyville which owns the auditorium has threatened to tear it down if repairs cannot be made within 2 years. The [http://shelbyvillechautauqua.com/ Chautauqua Auditorium Preservation Committee] is working on funding for a four-phase renovation project.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.landmarks.org/ten_most.htm# |title=Illinois Landmarks 10 Most Endangered- Chautauqua Auditorium |access-date=2009-06-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090502010419/http://www.landmarks.org/ten_most.htm# |archive-date=2009-05-02 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Chötrul Düchen''', also known as '''Chonga Choepa''' or the '''Butter Lamp Festival''', is one of the four [[Buddhist festival]]s commemorating four events in the life of the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]], according to [[Tibetan culture|Tibetan traditions]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.namgyal.org/events/details.cfm?id=41 Chötrul Düchen] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071008194101/http://www.namgyal.org/events/details.cfm?id=41 |date=2007-10-08 }} at [[Namgyal Monastery]]&lt;/ref&gt; Chötrul Düchen closely follows [[Losar]], the Tibetan New Year. It takes place on the fifteenth day of the first month in the [[Tibetan calendar]] during the full moon, which is called Bumgyur Dawa. The first fifteen days of the year celebrate the fifteen days during which the historical [[Buddha]] displayed miracles for his disciples so as to increase their devotion.&lt;ref&gt;RIGPA New York, [http://www.rigpanyc.org/2012/03/04/chotrul-duchen/ "Celebration of Chotrul Düchen"] 8 March 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Chotrul Duchen, meaning "Great Day of Miraculous Manifestations", is one of the four great holy days observed by Tibetan Buddhists, always occurring on the Fifteenth day of the first lunar Month in the Tibetan calendar. During this time, it is believed that the effects of both positive and negative actions are multiplied ten million times.

To commemorate the occasion, Tibetans make lamps, traditionally of [[yak]] butter, called [[butter lamps]], in the shapes of flowers, trees, birds, and other auspicious symbols. They also create elaborate displays for the lamps in their homes and in public spaces, sometimes erecting structures as large as a building. All the lanterns are lit in celebration on the fifteenth day of the month.&lt;ref&gt;Tibet Discovery, [http://www.tibetdiscovery.com/tibet-festivals/butter-lamp-festival/ "Butter Lamp Festival"]&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2018 date is Monday the 16th of July. &lt;ref&gt;https://fpmt.org/media/resources/dharma-dates/&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''Do not pass Go. Do not collect $200'''" is a phrase used in the [[Monopoly (game)|''Monopoly'' board game]] that has become widely used in popular culture to describe an action forced upon a person that has only negative results.&lt;ref name="Colarusso1992"&gt;{{cite book|author=Calvin A. Colarusso|title=Child and Adult Development: A Psychoanalytic Introduction for Clinicians|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ldMAqxhKB4gC&amp;pg=PA88|accessdate=25 June 2013|date=30 September 1992|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-0-306-44285-8|page=88}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bucci2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Steve Bucci|title=Credit Repair Kit For Dummies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=m2Xx4mUB5RQC&amp;pg=PT179|accessdate=25 June 2013|date=28 July 2008|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-0-470-27673-0|page=179}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==
The phrase comes from ''Monopoly'', which has decks of cards called [[Chance and Community Chest cards|Chance and Community Chest]] which a player must draw from if they land on specific spaces. Each deck has a card that reads "GO TO JAIL: Go directly to Jail. Do not pass Go. Do not collect $200."&lt;ref name="Sommers-FlanaganSommers-Flanagan2012"&gt;{{cite book|author1=John Sommers-Flanagan|author2=Rita Sommers-Flanagan|title=Counseling and Psychotherapy Theories in Context and Practice: Skills, Strategies, and Techniques|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RMclh6zR3LEC&amp;pg=PA361|accessdate=25 June 2013|date=10 February 2012|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-1-118-28904-4|page=361}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early in the game, going to jail usually hurts a player as it prevents them from moving, which regularly leads to earning $200 from passing Go, and from landing on and buying property, though in the later game, jail prevents them from landing on others' developed property and having to pay rent. The cited phrase, "Do not pass Go. Do not collect $200", distinguishes the effect from other cards that move players; other cards use the phrasing "Advance to [a particular location]", which does allow the player to collect $200 if they pass Go during the advance.

==Meaning==
The phrase is used in popular culture to denote a situation in which there is only one immediate, highly unfavorable, irreversible outcome and has been described as a "harsh cliche".&lt;ref name="Serim2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ferdi Serim|title=Digital Learning: Strengthening and Assessing 21st Century Skills, Grades 5-8|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LjehHsQt0cEC&amp;pg=PT138|accessdate=25 June 2013|date=14 December 2011|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-1-118-13107-7|page=138}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SYH-20130610"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/harmony-now-name-of-the-game-20130609-2nxy8.html|title=Harmony now the name of the game|last=Morris|first=Linda|date=2013-06-10|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|accessdate=25 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NAF-20130507"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://higheredwatch.newamerica.net/blogposts/2013/the_academic_graveyard_shift_irs_provides_guidance_on_identifying_institutional_peers|title=The Academic Graveyard Shift: IRS Provides Guidance on Identifying Institutional Peers|last=Lounder|first=Andrew|date=2013-05-07|publisher=[[New America Foundation]]|accessdate=25 June 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130913054902/http://higheredwatch.newamerica.net/blogposts/2013/the_academic_graveyard_shift_irs_provides_guidance_on_identifying_institutional_peers|archivedate=13 September 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Eltham Well Hall rail crash''' was an accident on the British railway system that occurred on 11 June 1972 at approximately 21:35. 

An excursion train from [[Margate]] to [[Kentish Town]] derailed on a sharp curve at [[Eltham railway station|Eltham Well Hall station]], [[Eltham, London|Eltham]], London. The driver Robert Wilsdon and five passengers were killed, and 126 people were injured. At the subsequent [[public inquiry]] it was revealed that the driver had been [[Drunkenness|intoxicated]] by alcohol.

== Background ==

The train was an excursion for [[Kentish Town]]-based railway employees of the [[London Midland Region]] and their families. After arrival at Margate, the train was stabled at [[Ramsgate]]. Wilsdon was not due to be on duty until the afternoon and had gone to a [[pub]] at lunchtime with his brothers who said he spent the afternoon at home.

At about 15:20 Wilsdon booked on duty by telephone with [[Hither Green TMD|Hither Green depot]] and travelled by train to Ramsgate, where he met his 18 year old [[secondman]]. They prepared the train which consisted of a [[British Rail Class 47|Class 47]] [[diesel locomotive]] and 10 coaches. While they chatted the secondman 'smelt something pretty strong' on the driver's breath and when questioned about it, he replied that he had "had some beer at dinner time" and had "ended up going somewhere and drinking some [[sherry]]".

Nevertheless, at Wilsdon's suggestion, they both went to the nearby Railway Staff Association Club at about 19:00 and drank three pints of [[Bitter (beer)|light and bitter]] beer each. At 19:45 they met with the [[Conductor (transportation)#Train Conductor (UK and Australasia)|guard]] and took the train as [[Glossary_of_rail_transport_terms#E|empty coaching stock]] to Margate, where they picked up the passengers.

== The journey ==

The crew left the [[taxicab|cab]] for a few minutes and as a result the train departed from Margate eight minutes late.  The journey was normal until the train stopped for signals at [[Rainham (Kent) railway station|Rainham]], whereafter the driver made an unscheduled stop in the station to telephone the [[Signalman (rail)|signalman]] and ask about another excursion train that they were due to pass some distance ahead.  This was a very unusual action, particularly as he had made up almost seven minutes of the lost time.

The guard told the inquiry that after leaving Rainham he had noticed that the train's speed has been "a little bit excessive" and that the driver braked intensely between [[Gillingham, Medway|Gillingham]] and [[Chatham, Medway|Chatham]].  Approaching Eltham Park he became so concerned at the speed that he made two quick applications of the [[vacuum brake]] to try to draw the driver's attention, but before he could get a reaction it was too late.

== The accident ==

The curve at Eltham has a [[speed limit]] of {{convert|20|mph|kph}}, but according to eyewitness accounts, the train entered it whilst travelling at about {{convert|65|mph|kph}}. Computations later proved that the driver had apparently shut off power where required, but had not made a brake application.

The [[locomotive]] and first four coaches left the rails and came to rest at an angle to the track, the second and third coaches on their sides. The next five coaches were derailed but the 10th, in which the guard was riding, was not.

The actor [[Phil Daniels]], star of ''[[Quadrophenia (film)|Quadrophenia]]'', ''[[Scum (film)|Scum]]'', and later ''[[EastEnders]]'' was aboard one of the derailed coaches with his parents after a day trip.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Class Actor| publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster UK| first=Phil| last=Daniels| year=2010| isbn=9781847376206}}&lt;!-- reference details gleaned from Google Books https://books.google.com/books?id=bg1dPgAACAAJ&amp;dq=class+actor&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjokJajmcDVAhXh34MKHTU0AQwQ6AEIKDAA --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=August 2017}}

== Investigation ==

All witnesses who saw the driver including the guard, the station staff at both Rainham and Margate, and the depot staff at Ramsgate, observed no signs of intoxication. His speech was clear and his [[Gait (human)|gait]] was normal. Those who knew the driver said that he was quite a frequent drinker of alcohol and could "carry" much beer.

A [[post-mortem examination]] of Wilsdon showed that he had a [[blood alcohol level]] of 0.278% (the legal limit for driving a road vehicle in England at that time was 0.08%). There was an imbalance with the [[urine]] alcohol level which made it very likely that the driver had also been drinking alcohol at the controls. Two bottles of beer given to the crew by the excursion's organisers were found in the cab, but they were unopened. A medical expert stated that during the time given, 5½ pints of bitter, a third of a bottle of sherry and a quarter bottle of spirits would "just about achieve" the levels found, providing that "the bulk of the spirits was drunk between 20:15 and 21:30". The inquiry hypothesized that the driver had taken [[Distilled beverage|spirits]] into the cab with him, having collected them during his unexplained absence before leaving Margate.

The secondman may not have been attentive because he had also been drinking, but he did not know the route and would not have realised that the driver was not braking for the curve when he should have been.

== Recommendations ==

The Inspecting Officer, [[Colonel]] J.R.H. Robertson, concluded that the driver Robert Wilsdon had "grossly impaired his ability to drive safely by drinking a considerable quantity of alcohol both before and after booking on duty, including some shortly before leaving Margate and some more in his cab during the journey."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.railwaysarchive.co.uk/eventsummary.php?eventID=134| title=Accident at Eltham Well Hall on 11th June 1972| website=Railways Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He made recommendations that booking-on of drivers by telephone should be controlled carefully, but did not recommend any changes to warnings of permanent speed restrictions. However, changes were made to the signalling at Eltham so that through trains would receive a yellow [[railway signal|signal]] on approach. 

The recommendation that booking-on by telephone be carefully controlled was reiterated in the Inspectorate report of the [[Cannon Street station rail crash]] in 1991.

The '''Exploration Mission-2''', or '''EM-2''', is a scheduled 2023 mission of the [[Space Launch System]] and possibly the first crewed mission of [[NASA]]'s [[Orion (spacecraft)|Orion]] spacecraft.&lt;ref name=launch2023&gt;https://www.rocketlaunch.live/launch/em-2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2017/09/sls-em-1-em-3-notional-mission-outline/ |title=SLS EM-1 &amp; -2 launch dates realign; EM-3 gains notional mission outline |last=Gebhardt |first=Chris |date=22 September 2017 |website=NASASpaceFlight.com |accessdate=23 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally, the crewed mission was intended to collect samples from a captured asteroid in [[lunar orbit]] by the now cancelled robotic [[Asteroid Redirect Mission]].&lt;ref name="claw 2015"&gt;{{cite news |last=Foust |first=Jeff |url=http://spacenews.com/nasa-selects-boulder-option-for-asteroid-redirect-mission/ |title=NASA Selects Boulder Option for Asteroid Redirect Mission |work=Space News |date=March 25, 2015 |accessdate=2015-03-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The plan is for a crewed Orion spacecraft to perform a lunar flyby test and return to Earth. As of September 2018 the last crewed spacecraft to leave low Earth orbit was [[Apollo 17]] in 1972.

{{see also|Asteroid Redirect Mission|Asteroid capture|Human mission to an asteroid}}
Until 2017, EM-2 was a projected single-launch mission of a [[Space Launch System]] Block IB with an [[Exploration Upper Stage]], lunar Block 1 Orion Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle (MPCV), and a payload insertion of 50.7&amp;nbsp;t. The plan was to rendezvous with an asteroid previously placed in lunar orbit by the robotic [[Asteroid Redirect Mission]] and have astronauts perform space-walks and gather samples.&lt;ref name=wall-2013&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  After the cancellation of the Asteroid Redirect Mission, it was proposed in 2017 to fly an eight-day mission with a crew of four astronauts, sent on a free return trajectory around the Moon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |editor=Gary Daines |date=August 4, 2017 |url=https://www.nasa.gov/feature/nasa-s-first-flight-with-crew-will-mark-important-step-on-journey-to-mars |title=NASA's First Flight With Crew Will Mark Important Step on Journey to Mars |publisher=NASA |orig-year=Originally published: December 1, 2016 |access-date=2017-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another proposal suggested in 2017 was to take four astronauts aboard Orion on an 8-to-21-day trip around the Moon to deliver the first element of the [[Lunar Orbital Platform-Gateway]] (LOP-G).&lt;ref name="nsf2017"&gt;{{cite web |date=April 6, 2017 |last=Gebhardt |first=Chris |url=https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2017/04/nasa-goals-missions-sls-eyes-multi-step-mars/ |title=NASA finally sets goals, missions for SLS – eyes multi-step plan to Mars |website=NASASpaceFlight.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mission profile is a multi-translunar injection (MTLI), or multiple departure burns, and includes a free return trajectory from the Moon. Basically, the spacecraft will orbit Earth twice while periodically firing its engines to build up enough velocity to push it toward the Moon before looping back to Earth.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nasa.gov/feature/nasa-s-first-flight-with-crew-will-mark-important-step-on-journey-to-mars NASA's First Flight With Crew Will Mark Important Step on Journey to Mars].

In 1968, the [[Apollo 8]] mission, crewed by 3 astronauts, was designed to test-fly a [[Apollo Command/Service Module|Command/Service Module]] beyond low Earth orbit. Although similar to EM-2 in that it was crewed and did not land on the Moon, it differed by entering lunar orbit for an extended stay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.csmonitor.com/Science/Spacebound/2017/0225/Apollo-8-redux-Why-NASA-may-send-humans-around-the-moon-again |title= Apollo 8 redux: Why NASA may send humans around the Moon, again |author= Charlie Wood |publisher= [[Christian Science Monitor]] |date= 25 February 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, the company [[Space Adventures]] announced plans to [[Tourism on the Moon|take two tourists]] within {{convert|100|km|mi|abbr=on}} of the lunar surface using a [[Soyuz (spacecraft)|Soyuz spacecraft]] piloted by a professional [[cosmonaut]]. The mission, named [[DSE-Alpha]], has been priced at {{US$|150 million}} per seat and is expected to last 8–9 days when scheduled. Company CEO Eric Anderson stated in 2011 that one seat had been sold, but the launch date has continually slipped since the second seat remains unsold {{as of|2017|lc=y}}.&lt;ref name="popmec20110426"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.popularmechanics.com/space/rockets/a13025/just-one-150-million-seat-remains-on-space-adventures-lunar-flyby/ |title=Just One ($150 Million) Seat Remains on Space Adventures' Lunar Flyby |work=[[Popular Mechanics]] |first=Andrew |last=Moseman |date=April 26, 2011 |accessdate=2017-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[SpaceX lunar tourism mission]] was initially proposed for late 2018 and would have been similar to EM-2 in crew size, with two space tourists paying for a free-return loop around the Moon and back to Earth, using the [[Crew Dragon]] capsule and launched on the [[Falcon Heavy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9R3Ndv7958 |title=SpaceX promises a Moon vacation in 2018 |publisher=[[The Verge]] |date=3 March 2017 |via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://nerdist.com/spacex-will-attempt-to-send-humans-around-the-moon-next-year/ |title=SpaceX Will Attempt to Send Humans Around the Moon Next Year |website=Nerdist |author=Dave Trumbore |date=27 February 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After the first flight of Falcon Heavy in 2018, SpaceX announced that Falcon Heavy would not be used for crewed flights to focus their future development on [[BFR (rocket)|BFR]] and indicated that the lunar mission would more likely be carried out with the BFR system.&lt;ref&gt;[http://spacenews.com/spacex-no-longer-planning-crewed-missions-on-falcon-heavy/ SpaceX no longer planning crewed missions on Falcon Heavy].

==Background==
On 24 September 1897, Henry Sylvester Williams had been instrumental in founding the African Association (not to be confused with the [[Association for Promoting the Discovery of the Interior Parts of Africa]]), in response to the European [[partition of Africa]] that followed the [[Berlin Conference (1884)|1884-5 Congress of Berlin]]. The formation of the association marked an early stage in the development of the anti-colonialist movement, and was established to encourage the unity of Africans and people of African descent, particularly in territories of the [[British empire]],&lt;ref&gt;"African Association", in E. L. Bute and H. J. P. Harmer, ''The Black Handbook: The People, History and Politics of Africa and the African Diaspora'', London &amp; Washington: Cassell, 1997, p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt; concerning itself with injustices in Britain's African and Caribbean colonies.&lt;ref&gt;Immanuel Ness and Zak Cope (eds), [https://books.google.com/books?id=DFsYDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA908&amp;lpg=PA908&amp;dq=%22First+Pan-African+Conference%22+1900&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=1YAxSrODbp&amp;sig=IUrVcroh8Xc0F0L05DuEFFHJfSE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi4i9C8ofzOAhUKBcAKHd7KC1UQ6AEIYzAM#v=onepage&amp;q=%22First%20Pan-African%20Conference%22%201900&amp;f=false "The First Pan-African Conference"], ''The Palgrave Encyclopedia of Imperialism and Anti-Imperialism'', Volume 1, Palgrave Macmillan, 2016, p. 908.&lt;/ref&gt; In March 1898 the association issued a circular calling for a pan-African conference. [[Booker T. Washington]], who had been travelling in the UK in the summer of 1899, wrote in a letter to African-American newspapers: 
{{quote|text="In connection with the assembling of so many Negroes in London from different parts of the world, a very important movement has just been put upon foot. It is known as the Pan-African Conference. Representatives from Africa, the West Indian Islands and other parts of the world, asked me to meet them a few days ago with a view to making a preliminary program for this conference, and we had a most interesting meeting. It is surprising to see the strong intellectual mould which many of these Africans and West Indians possess. The object and character of the Pan-African Conference is best told in the words of the resolution, which was adopted at the meeting referred to, viz: 'In view of the widespread ignorance which is prevalent in England about the treatment of native races under European and American rule, the African Association, which consists of members of the race resident in England and which has been in existence for nearly two years, have resolved during the Paris Exposition of 1900 (which many representatives of the race may be visiting) to hold a conference in London in the month of May of the said year, in order to take steps to influence public opinion on existing proceedings and conditions affecting the welfare of the natives in various parts of Africa, the West Indies and the United States.' The resolution is signed by Mr H. Mason Joseph, President, and Mr H. Sylvester Williams as Honourable Secretary. The Honourable Secretary will be pleased to hear from representative natives who are desirous of attending at an early date. He may be addressed, Common Room, Grey's (sic) Inn, London, W.C."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted by J. R. Hooker in "The Pan-African Conference 1900", ''[[Transition Magazine]]'', No. 46 (1974), pp. 20–24 (p. 20).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Conference concerns and issues==
When the First Pan-African Conference opened on Monday, 23 July 1900, in London's [[Westminster Hall]], Bishop Alexander Walters in his opening address, "The Trials and Tribulations of the Coloured Race in America", noted that "for the first time in history black people had gathered from all parts of the globe to discuss and improve the condition of their race, to assert their rights and organize so that they might take an equal place among nations."&lt;ref name=Fryer283&gt;Fryer (1984), p. 283.&lt;/ref&gt; The Bishop of London, [[Mandell Creighton]], gave a speech of welcome "referring to 'the benefits of self-government' which Britain must confer on 'other races ... as soon as possible'."&lt;ref name=Fryer283 /&gt; 

Speakers over the three days addressed a variety of aspects of racial discrimination. Among the papers delivered were: "Conditions Favouring a High Standard of African Humanity" (C. W. French of [[St. Kitts]]), "The Preservation of Racial Equality" ([[Anna H. Jones]], from [[Kansas City, Missouri]]), "The Necessary Concord to be Established between Native Races and European Colonists" ([[Benito Sylvain]],&lt;ref&gt;Benito Sylvain's account of the conference, entitled "The Pan-African Association", was published in his book ''Du Sort des Indigènes dans les Colonies d'Exploitation'' (Paris: L. Boyer, 1901). See Tony Martin, "Benito Sylvain of Haiti on the Pan-African Conference of 1900", in ''The Pan-African Connection: From Slavery to Garvey and Beyond'', Cambridge, Mass.: Schenkman Publishing, 1983, pp. 201–16.&lt;/ref&gt; Haitian aide-de-camp to the Ethiopian emperor), "The Negro Problem in America" ([[Anna J. Cooper]], from Washington), "The Progress of our People" (John E. Quinlan of [[St. Lucia]]) and "Africa, the Sphinx of History, in the Light of Unsolved Problems" (D. E. Tobias from the USA).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/SLAwilliamsS.htm "Sylvester Williams"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121022091321/http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/SLAwilliamsS.htm |date=October 22, 2012 }}, Spartacus Educational.&lt;/ref&gt; Other topics included Richard Phipps' complaint of discrimination against black people in the [[Trinidad &amp; Tobago|Trinidadian]] civil service and an attack by William Meyer, a medical student at [[Edinburgh University]], on pseudo-scientific racism. Discussions followed the presentation of the papers, and on the last day George James Christian, a law student from [[Dominica]],&lt;ref&gt;Thomson Fontaine, [http://www.thedominican.net/articles/christian.htm "George James Christian: Pioneer in Africa"], Thedominican.net, Vol. 1, Issue 32, 27 November 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gabriel J.

The conference culminated in the conversion of the African Association (formed by Sylvester Williams in 1897) into the [[Pan-African Association]],&lt;ref name=Bandele /&gt; and the implementation of a unanimously adopted "Address to the Nations of the World", sent to various heads of state where people of African descent were living and suffering oppression.&lt;ref name="Oxford Companion"&gt;Shivani Sivagurunathan, "Pan-Africanism", in [[David Dabydeen]], John Gilmore, Cecily Jones (eds), ''The Oxford Companion to Black British History'', Oxford University Press, 2007, pp. 259–60.&lt;/ref&gt; The address implored the United States and the imperial European nations to “acknowledge and protect the rights of people of African descent” and to respect the integrity and independence of "the free Negro States of [[Ethiopia|Abyssinia]], [[Liberia]], [[Haiti]], etc."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blackpast.org/?q=perspectives/pan-african-congresses-1900-1945 The Pan-African Congresses, 1900–1945], BlackPast.org.&lt;/ref&gt; Signed by Walters (President of the Pan-African Association), the Canadian Rev.

Radway, Kevin Gaines, Barry Shank, Penny Von Eschen (eds), ''American Studies: An Anthology'', Wiley-Blackwell, 2009, p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt;

In September, the delegates petitioned [[Queen Victoria]] through the British government to look into the treatment of Africans in South Africa and Rhodesia, including specified acts of injustice perpetrated by whites there, namely:&lt;blockquote&gt;
# The degrading and illegal compound system of labour in vogue in [[Kimberley, Northern Cape|Kimberley]] and [[Rhodesia]]. 
# The so-called indenture, i.e., legalized bondage of African men and women and children to white colonists. 
# The system of compulsory labour in public works. 
# The "pass" or docket system used for people of colour. 
# Local by-laws tending to segregate and degrade Africans such as the curfew; the denial to Africans of the use of footpaths; and the use of separate public conveyances. 
# Difficulties in acquiring real property. 
# Difficulties in obtaining the franchise.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The response eventually received by Sylvester-Williams on 17 January 1901 stated:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Sir. I am directed by Mr Secretary [[Joseph Chamberlain|Chamberlain]] to state that he has received the Queen's commands to inform you that the Memorial of the Pan-African Conference requesting the situation of the native races in South Africa, has been laid before Her Majesty, and that she was graciously pleased to command him to return an answer to it on behalf of her government.

2. Mr. Chamberlain accordingly desires to assure the members of the Pan-African Conference that, it settling the lines on which the administration of the conquered territories is to be conducted, Her Majesty's Government will not overlook the interests and 
welfare of the native races.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.houseofknowledge.org.uk/site/documents/neoGarveyismCorner/1900%20petition%20to%20Queen%20Victoria.pdf "1900 Pan African Conference Petition to Queen Victoria"]. Source: [[Molefi K. Asante]], ''The History of Africa'', New York &amp; London: Routledge, 2007, p. 260.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Days later, Victoria responded more personally, instructing her private secretary, [[Arthur Bigge]], to write, which he did on 21 January - the day before the Queen died.&lt;ref&gt;J. R. Hooker, "The Pan-African Conference 1900", ''Transition'', No. 46 (1974), p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the specific injustices in South Africa continued for some time, the conference brought them to the attention of the world.&lt;ref&gt;Frank A. Salamone, [https://books.google.com/books?id=6gbQHxb_P0QC&amp;pg=RA3-PA43&amp;lpg=RA3-PA43&amp;dq=%22First+Pan-African+Conference%22+1900&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=xPZy9yA_eP&amp;sig=jSHWYO10MJdG-wvjmnuUwNHna7c&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi4i9C8ofzOAhUKBcAKHd7KC1UQ6AEIaDAO#v=onepage&amp;q=%22First%20Pan-African%20Conference%22%201900&amp;f=false "Pan-African Conference, London"], in [[Paul Finkelman]], ''Encyclopedia of African American History, 1896 to the Present'', Oxford University Press, 2009, p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Press coverage and local reception==
The conference was reported in major British newspapers, including ''[[The Times]]''&lt;ref name=Bandele /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"PanAfrican Conference", ''The Times'' (London), 24 July 1900, and "PanAfrican Conference", ''The Times'' (London), 25 July 1900.&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''[[Westminster Gazette]]'',&lt;ref name="Oxford Companion" /&gt; which commented that it "marks the initiation of a remarkable movement in history: the negro is at last awake to the potentialities of his future" and quoted Williams as saying: "Our object now is to secure throughout the world the same facilities and privileges for the black as the white man enjoys."&lt;ref name=Fryer287&gt;Fryer, p. 287.&lt;/ref&gt; 

DuBois recorded in his report, 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"On Monday, the 23d of July, the conference was invited to a five o'clock tea given by the Reform [[Cobden Club]] of London in honor of the delegates, at its headquarters in the [[St Ermin's Hotel|St. Ermin Hotel]], one of the most elegant in the city. Several members of Parliament and other notables were present. A splendid repast was served, and for two hours the delegates were delightfully entertained by the members and friends of the club.

At 5 o'clock on Tuesday a tea was given in our honor by the late Dr. Creighton, Lord Bishop of London, at his stately [[Fulham Palace|palace at Fulham]], which has been occupied by the Bishops of London since the fifteenth century. On our arrival at the palace we found his Lordship and one or two other Bishops, with their wives and daughters, waiting to greet us. After a magnificent repast had been served we were conducted through the extensive grounds which surround the palace....

Through the kindness of Mr. Clark, a member of Parliament, we were invited to tea on Wednesday, at 5 o'clock, on the Terrace of Parliament. After the tea the male members of our party were admitted to the [[House of Commons of England|House of Commons]], which is considered quite an honor; indeed, the visit to the House of Parliament and tea on the Terrace was the crowning honor of the series. Great credit is due our genial secretary, Mr. H. Sylvester Williams, for these social functions.

Miss [[Catherine Impey]], of London, said she was glad to come in contact with the class of Negroes that composed the Pan-African Conference, and wished that the best and most cultured would visit England and meet her citizens of noble birth, that the adverse opinion which had been created against them in some quarters of late by their enemies might be changed."&lt;ref name=Address /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Legacy==
After the conference ended, Williams set up branches of the Pan-African Association in [[Jamaica]], Trinidad and the USA. He also launched a short-lived journal, ''The Pan-African'', in October 1901.&lt;ref name=Fryer287 /&gt; Although plans for the association to meet every two years failed, the 1900 conference encouraged the development of the [[Pan-African Congress]].&lt;ref&gt;"Pan-African Conference", in Bute and Harmer, ''The Black Handbook'', 1997, p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt;

As [[Tony Martin (professor)|Tony Martin]] noted, "At least three of the Caribbean delegates later emigrated to Africa. George Christian of Dominica became a successful lawyer and legislator in the [[Gold Coast (British colony)|Gold Coast]] ([[Ghana]]) where he was a member of the Legislative Council from 1920 to 1940. Richard E. Phipps, the Trinidad barrister, returned home after the conference and emigrated to the Gold Coast in 1911. He remained there until his death around 1926. Williams himself lived in South Africa from 1903 to 1905,10 and died in Trinidad in 1911."&lt;ref&gt;Tony Martin, [http://www.unesco.org/culture/caribbean/pdf/ghc_onlinechapter_vol5_chap6_en.pdf "African consciousness"], in ''General History of the Caribbean'', Unesco, 1996, Vol. 5, Chapter 6, pp. 259–60.&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the Pan-African Congress banner, a series of gatherings subsequently took place — in 1919 in [[Paris]], 1921 in London, 1923 in London, 1927 in [[New York City]], 1945 in [[Manchester]], 1974 in [[Dar es Salaam]] and 1994 in [[Kampala]] — to address the issues facing Africa as a result of European [[colonization]].

A centenary commemorative event was held in London on 25 July 2000,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.panafricanperspective.com/centenary_panafrican_celebration.htm "Centenary Pan African Conference a Resounding Success"], Pan-African Perspective.&lt;/ref&gt; attended by descendants of some of the delegates at the original conference, as well as descendants of delegates at the 1945 [[Pan-African Congress#5th Pan-African Congress|5th Pan-African Congress]] in Manchester.&lt;ref&gt;Lester Lewis, [http://www.raceandhistory.com/historicalviews/panafricanrise.htm "Pan Africans on the Rise Again"], RaceandHistory.com, 23 January 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Gathering of Nations''' is the largest [[pow-wow]] in the United States and North America. It is held annually the fourth weekend in April, on the Powwow Grounds at Expo NM, in [[Albuquerque, New Mexico]]. Over 565 tribes from around the United States and 220 from Canada travel to Albuquerque to participate. There are 36 dance categories, and different age group categories including Elders (70+), Golden Age (55+), Adults (19+), Teens and Tiny Tots. Other competitions include Northern Singers, Southern Singers, Women's Back-up Singing, and a competition for Drum Groups and Drummers and other various special competitions.  A pageant for Miss Indian World is held each year. The winner is chosen based upon personality, knowledge of tribal traditions, and dancing ability. There is also Indian Traders Market featuring artists, crafters and traders selling Native American and Indigenous arts and crafts.
Additional activities during this native themed festival is stage 49
The contemporary music and performance space where native musicians and others experience performance on a professional stage and in front of a large audience. Also is the native horse and rider regalia parade, honoring the horse culture among tribes. And the tee pee village. Gathering of Nations also participates annually in a literacy program, delivering over four thousand books to young children registered to dance.

Gathering of Nations maintains a high level traveling show since 1995, with performances throughout USA, Asia, Europe and on Broadway in New York City. Also numerous performances on national television with five live performances on the NBC ''Today'' show. 2010 Grammy winner for best Native American music album, ''A Spirit's Dance''.

The Gathering of Nations Powwow is a family event where everyone is invited. 
The Gathering of Nations is North America's biggest Powwow.

== Electric 49 ==
The ''Electric 49'' was an annual Native American Music concert held during the weekend of Pow-wow, but in no way associated with the official events of the Gathering.

The concert was originated/created by the group [[Red Earth (band)|Red Earth]] in 1998, and saw eight annual editions since that year.  Since 2006, however, there has not been another festival, as Red Earth remains on hiatus. The Electric 49 focused on highlighting artistically challenging Native American Musicians throughout the Americas, and its goal was to highlight contemporary Native music.

Throughout the years, the Electric 49 has featured [[Red Earth (band)|Red Earth]], [[Robert Mirabal]], Ethnic DeGeneration, Star Nayea, Native Roots, Casper, Querosene Jacare (of [[Brazil]]), Cisco, Derek Miller, Stoic Frame, DJ Abel and Quese IMC. True to the diversity of contemporary native music, festival performers have been from across numerous genres including [[Heavy metal music|Heavy metal]], [[Reggae]], [[Blues]], [[Hip hop]], [[New Mexico music]], and Waila (Chicken Scratch).

On 24 April 2014, Oliver Duggan, in the ''[[Liverpool Echo]]'', reported that users of computers that used [[IP address]]es registered to the [[Government Secure Intranet]] (which is used by many of the [[United Kingdom]]'s [[Departments of the United Kingdom Government|government departments]]) had added derogatory and offensive material to [[Wikipedia]] articles, particularly the article about the [[Hillsborough disaster]].&lt;ref name=Echo /&gt; The vandalism was quickly re-reported by other media, and subsequent reports have highlighted other acts of [[Vandalism on Wikipedia|vandalism]], on various articles, originated by computers using those IP addresses. After an investigation by ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' and [[Wikipediocracy]] the person behind the edits was identified as a "junior civil servant" within the UK government and was dismissed.

The issue first emerged when it was reported that the entry about the Hillsborough disaster, in which 96 people died at a football match at the [[Hillsborough Stadium]] in 1989, had been altered, briefly, in 2009,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url={{fullurl:Hillsborough_disaster|diff=prev&amp;oldid=283956539}}|title=Wikipedia diff 283956539|publisher=Wikimedia Foundation|date=2009-04-15|accessdate=2015-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a similar alteration to the [[Anfield]] article in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url={{fullurl:Anfield|diff=prev&amp;oldid=493826709}}|title=Wikipedia diff 493826709|publisher=Wikimedia Foundation|date=2012-05-22|accessdate=2015-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report suggested that the edits could have been made from the [[Department for Culture, Media and Sport]], [[Her Majesty's Treasury]] or the [[Solicitor General for England and Wales|Office of the Solicitor General]]&lt;ref name=Echo&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/hillsborough-wikipedia-insults-added-government-7029881 | title=Exclusive: Shocking Hillsborough insults added on Wikipedia from Government computers | work=[[Liverpool Echo]] | date=24 April 2014 | accessdate=27 April 2014 | author=Duggan, Oliver}}&lt;/ref&gt; since those departments use the Government Secure Intranet. However, the [[Cabinet Office]] has stated that  "At this time, we have no reason to suspect that the Hillsborough edits involve any particular department, nor more than one or two individuals in 2009 and 2012."&lt;ref name=BBCa&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-merseyside-27165844 | title=Hillsborough Wikipedia posts were 'sickening', Cabinet Office says | work=[[BBC News]] | date=25 April 2014 | accessdate=8 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The details of the two IP addresses (195.92.40.49 and 62.25.106.209&lt;ref name=Eagle /&gt;&lt;ref name=BBCb /&gt;) used by computers on the Government Secure Intranet came from then-Treasury minister [[Angela Eagle]] in a reply to a [[UK Parliamentary questions|parliamentary question]] in 2008.&lt;ref name=Echo /&gt;&lt;ref name=Eagle&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.theyworkforyou.com/wrans/?id=2008-12-11d.241962.h&amp;s=%28ip+address%29+speaker%3A10182#g241962.r0 | title=Departmental Internet: 11 Dec 2008: Hansard Written Answers - TheyWorkForYou | work=[[TheyWorkForYou]] | date=11 December 2008 | accessdate=8 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The edits, which were made in 2009 (on the disaster's 20th anniversary) and 2012, included the addition of "Blame [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] Fans" to the Hillsborough disaster page and adding the phrases "You'll Never Walk Again" and "yet nothing for the victims of the [[Heysel Stadium disaster]]" to mentions of the Hillsborough memorial in the [[Anfield]] article.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/government-launches-inquiry-after-hillsborough-insults-traced-to-whitehall-computers-9285036.html | title=Hillsborough Wikipedia posts: Government launches inquiry after insults aimed at Liverpool fans traced to Government computers in Whitehall | work=[[The Independent]] | date=25 April 2014 | accessdate=27 April 2014 | author=Johnston, Ian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Cabinet Office responded to the news by saying that they were making "urgent inquiries" into these reports, and that the claims made in them were being treated with "the utmost seriousness".&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-merseyside-27152223 | title=Hillsborough Wikipedia posts: Government pledges 'urgent inquiries' | work=[[BBC News]] | date=25 April 2014 | accessdate=27 April 2014 | author=Johnson, Dan}}&lt;/ref&gt; The office also warned, however, that it might not be possible to determine exactly who used the government's computers to make the edits, saying, "As the first incident happened five years ago and there are hundreds of thousands of people on the government's network, it may prove challenging to identify who was involved, but we are exhausting every option."&lt;ref name=BBCa /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.independent.ie/world-news/europe/finding-hillsborough-trolls-could-be-tough-30219800.html | title=Finding Hillsborough 'trolls' could be tough | work=[[Independent.ie]] | date=26 April 2014 | accessdate=27 April 2014 | author=Press Association}}&lt;/ref&gt; The inquiry was scheduled to be overseen—but not led—by [[Andy Burnham]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/full-parliamentary-probe-shocking-hillsborough-7035260 | title=Full parliamentary probe into shocking Hillsborough insults added to Wikipedia from Government computers | work=Liverpool Echo | date=25 April 2014 | accessdate=27 April 2014 | author=Duggan, Oliver}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 20 May, Burnham said the investigation had identified "strong leads" into determining who made the edits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/strong-leads-hunt-trolls-behind-7143197 | title=Hilsborough Wikipedia scandal: 'Strong leads' in hunt for trolls who used Government computer | work=Liverpool Echo | date=20 May 2014 | accessdate=20 May 2014 | author=Johnson, Mark}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, after the second verdict of the Hillsborough inquiry proved [[unlawful killing]] of the 96 dead due to [[gross negligence]], the ''Liverpool Echo'' reported that edits from an IP associated with [[Warwickshire County Council]] (WCC) added the phrase "You'll never walk again" eight times in the lead of the Hillsborough disaster page.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url={{fullurl:Hillsborough_disaster|diff=prev&amp;oldid=717548799}}|title=Wikipedia diff 717548799|publisher=Wikimedia Foundation|date=28 April 2016|accessdate=30 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A WCC spokesperson told the newspaper: "WCC IP addresses also include our publicly used machines in libraries that can be used by members of the public. The information has been passed onto the head of our IT team and we are going to be investigating."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Fitzsimmons|first1=Francesca|title=Offensive Hillsborough comments added to Wikipedia using council IP address|url=http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/offensive-hillsborough-comments-added-wikipedia-11256592|accessdate=30 April 2016|work=Liverpool Echo|date=28 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other articles==
On 26 April, the ''[[Belfast Telegraph]]'' reported that one of the edits made via a government IP address (to the Wikipedia entry for [[Howick Falls]]) had mentioned "killing or enslaving" [[black people]] and suggested that they believe "hearsay and myth".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/uk/wikipedia-edits-linked-to-whitehall-30220069.html | title=Wikipedia edits linked to Whitehall | work=[[Belfast Telegraph]] | date=26 April 2014 | accessdate=27 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Daily Telegraph'' reported on 27 April that government computers had been used to maliciously alter articles about prominent people, including falsifying the death of television sports presenter [[Des Lynam]]. Other public figures targeted include [[Michael Grade]] and [[Chris Evans (presenter)|Chris Evans]].&lt;ref&gt;Oliver Duggan [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/wikipedia/10791202/Des-Lynam-killed-by-a-giant-snowball-and-other-embarrassing-Wikipedia-edits-from-Whitehall-computers.html "Des Lynam 'killed by a giant snowball' and other embarrassing Wikipedia edits from Whitehall computers"], ''Daily Telegraph'', 27 April 2014&lt;/ref&gt; On the same day, ''[[The Herald (Glasgow)|The Herald]]'' in Glasgow reported that the articles for [[Clydebank]] and [[Barlanark]], had been vandalized by government computers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/home-news/offensive-wikipedia-edits-made-in-whitehall.24068250 | title=Offensive Wikipedia edits made in Whitehall | work=Herald Scotland | date=27 April 2014 | accessdate=27 April 2014 | author=Duffy, Judith}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also that day, the ''[[National Post]]'' reported that a government computer had also targeted the page about Canadian author [[David Gilmour (writer)|David Gilmour]], which was vandalized to describe him as a "misogynist, homophobe [and] racist".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://news.nationalpost.com/2014/04/27/u-k-government-computer-used-to-edit-canadian-author-david-gilmours-wikipedia-page-call-him-a-homophobe/ | title=U.K. government computer used to edit Canadian author David Gilmour’s Wikipedia page, call him a ‘homophobe’ | work=[[National Post]] | date=27 April 2014 | accessdate=8 May 2014 | author=Edmiston, Jake}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 29 April, the [[BBC]] reported the results of its investigation into the edits carried out by computers using the two IP addresses. It found more than one hundred edits that it categorised as "inappropriate editing, vandalism and deletion". The BBC gave no time scale  for these edits but did reveal that edits were made in 2005 and 2006 and that "several of the offensive messages were made prior to the government IP addresses being disclosed in 2008".

The most serious edit was a change to the [[veil]] article, in October 2006, which included the phrase "all Muslims are terrorists".&lt;ref&gt;[{{fullurl:Veil|diff=prev&amp;oldid=82628573}}]&lt;/ref&gt; This change was removed six minutes later. Also highlighted was the removal of details, in October 2005, of the [[Cherie Blair#Controversies|controversy]] regarding flat purchases by [[Cherie Blair]]. Other edits mentioned by the BBC were the editing of the [[7 July 2005 London bombings]] article to add conspiracy theories; and the vandalism, usually with insults and sometimes with page blanking, of the [[Tony Blair]], [[Richard Littlejohn]], [[Jamie Oliver]], [[The Libertines|Libertines]], [[Wayne Rooney]], [[Christopher Byrne (politician)|Christopher Byrne]], [[Peter Levy (presenter)|Peter Levy]] and [[Arsène Wenger]] articles.

Regarding the edits, while stating that the vandalism was appalling, a spokesman for [[Wikimedia UK]] pointed out that, "Edits of this nature are removed very quickly by the volunteers who write and edit Wikipedia, often in a matter of minutes." He also expanded on the nature of the editing process, saying "Wikipedia is the encyclopaedia that anyone can edit. This openness has led to an enormous reference work of great value. While vandalism does occasionally happen we are grateful to the many thousands of volunteers who write, edit and organise the content."&lt;ref name=BBCb&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-27203371 | title=Wikipedia edit from government computer added Muslim insult | work=BBC | date=29 April 2014 | accessdate=3 May 2014 | author=Lee, Dave}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reactions==
Jon Davies, chief executive of [[Wikimedia UK]], said it was "appalled by such vandalism" but added that, "In this case, none of the offensive comments were up for more than a couple of hours, and most were removed in a few minutes."&lt;ref name=BBC /&gt;

The [[Cabinet Office]] described the edits in question as "sickening". "The behaviour is in complete contravention of the [[Her Majesty's Civil Service#Codes#Civil Service Code|Civil Service Code]]. It is entirely unacceptable," they added.&lt;ref name=BBCb /&gt;

Sheila Coleman of the [[Hillsborough Justice Campaign]] called the edits "absolutely disgusting" and said the relatives of the Hillsborough disaster victims would demand a formal inquiry.&lt;ref name=Echo/&gt;

A [[Criticism of Wikipedia|critic of Wikipedia]], Nigel Scott, writing in ''[[Spiked (magazine)|Spiked]]'', sought to place the incident in the context of what he sees as Wikipedia's structural flaws, saying, "Wikipedia is not blameless in this. It allows misinformation to flourish and provides it with a cloak of respectability. It is under-resourced and is unable to police itself adequately." However, the main focus of his argument was other [[List of Wikipedia controversies|Wikipedia controversies]], including the creation of the [[Wikipedia:List of hoaxes on Wikipedia/Bicholim conflict|Bicholim conflict]] article, accusations of editing on behalf of [[Chuka Umunna#Online activity|Chuka Umunna]] and the [[Wiki-PR editing of Wikipedia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.spiked-online.com/newsite/article/wikipedia-where-truth-dies-online/14963#.U2BsTa1dXN4 | title=Wikipedia: where truth dies online | work=[[Spiked (magazine)|Spiked]] | date=29 April 2014 | accessdate=29 April 2014 | author=Scott, Nigel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Result of the investigation==
From May to June 2014, [[Wikipediocracy]], a website critical of Wikipedia, as well as ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' identified the culprit behind the offending edits to Wikipedia.  Using the results of the investigation published in the ''Telegraph'', the UK government identified and took action against the suspect.&lt;ref&gt;Duggan, Oliver, "[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/liverpool/10904540/Civil-servant-fired-after-Telegraph-investigation-into-Hillsborough-Wikipedia-slurs.html Civil servant fired after Telegraph investigation into Hillsborough Wikipedia slurs]", ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', 17 June 2014&lt;/ref&gt;  In June 2014, an unnamed 24-year-old [[civil servant]], who was born in London but lives in Liverpool, was sacked for posting offensive comments about the disaster on Wikipedia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/jun/17/civil-servant-sacked-wikipedia-edits-hillsborough |work=The Guardian |title=Civil servant sacked for offensive Wikipedia edits on Hillsborough |date=17 June 2014|accessdate=17 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the sacking, the United Kingdom government issued new rules for its civil servants with regard to editing Wikipedia. The guidelines include the statement that anyone making inappropriate edits will be disciplined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/government-issues-new-wikipedia-rules-7966638 | title=Government issues new Wikipedia rules for Whitehall staff after civil servant posted Hillsborough slurs | work=Liverpool Echo | date=20 October 2014 | accessdate=20 October 2014 | author=Docking, Neil}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
[[File:JFK Wooden Fence.jpg|thumb|200px|The wooden fence on the grassy knoll, where Files claims to have made his shot.]]

Files has stated that he was born in Alabama, moved to California with his family shortly thereafter, then to an Italian neighborhood in Chicago.&lt;ref name="Hytha 2"&gt;{{cite news |last=Hytha |first=Michael |date=February 20, 1996 |title=Awed by mob, he just bit bullet, pulled trigger  |url=http://jfk.hood.edu/Collection/Weisberg%20Subject%20Index%20Files/V%20Disk/Vernon%20Bob/Item%2001.pdf |newspaper=Contra Costa Times |volume=85 |issue=272 |location=Walnut Creek, California |publisher= |pages=1A, 4A |accessdate=August 6, 2014}}&lt;!-- The CCT published two articles on the subject by the same writer on the same day. --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; On May 7, 1991, Files and his friend, David Morley, were involved in a roadside shootout in [[Round Lake Beach, Illinois]], with two police officers, Detective David Ostertag and his partner, Gary Bitler. Ostertag and Bitler tried to apprehend the two for driving a stolen vehicle. During the shootout, Morley shot Detective Ostertag in the chest. Both Files and Morley shot at Detective Bitler but missed. Files and Morley then fled on foot but were arrested a few hours later. Files was charged with two counts of [[attempted murder]] and one count each of discharge of a firearm, aggravated battery with a firearm and armed violence. In August 1991, a jury found Files guilty of two counts of attempted murder. He was sentenced to 30 years for the shooting of Detective Ostertag and 20 years for attempting to shoot Detective Bitler.&lt;ref name="Bugliosi"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hytha 1"&gt;{{cite news |last=Hytha |first=Michael |date=February 20, 1996 |title=Illinois inmate says he did it |url=http://jfk.hood.edu/Collection/Weisberg%20Subject%20Index%20Files/V%20Disk/Vernon%20Bob/Item%2001.pdf |newspaper=Contra Costa Times |volume=85 |issue=272 |location=Walnut Creek, California |publisher= |pages=1A, 4A |accessdate=August 6, 2014}}&lt;!-- The CCT published two articles on the subject by the same writer on the same day. --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The People Of the State Of Illinois, Plaintiff-Appellee v.

==Critical analysis==
[[Vincent Bugliosi]], author of ''[[Reclaiming History: The Assassination of President John F. Kennedy]]'', has characterized Files as "the [[Rodney Dangerfield]] of Kennedy assassins."&lt;ref name="Bugliosi"/&gt;  According to Bugliosi, very few within the majority of Americans (75%) who believe there was a [[John F. Kennedy assassination conspiracy theories|conspiracy to kill Kennedy]] respect him or his story.&lt;ref name="Bugliosi"/&gt; However, psychology professor Jerome Kroth described Files as "surprisingly credible" and said his story "is the most believable and persuasive" about the assassination.&lt;ref name="Bugliosi"/&gt;

American singer [[Whitney Houston]] embarked on 10 concert tours, 6 of which were world tours and 4 which were territorial tours. After becoming the opening act for singer [[Jeffrey Osborne]] and [[Luther Vandross]] on their US amphitheatre tour and playing at various American theaters, festivals, and clubs in 1985, she embarked on her first worldwide tour, the successful [[The Greatest Love World Tour|The Greatest Love Tour]] in 1986.  With promoting worldwide mega hit album ''[[Whitney (album)|Whitney]]'', her second world tour, [[Moment of Truth World Tour|The Moment of Truth World Tour]] started in [[North America]] during the summer of 1987 and continued overseas during 1988 in [[Europe]], [[Japan]], [[Hong Kong]], and [[Australia]]. Especially in Europe, Houston visited 12 countries, playing to over half a million fans including nine consecutive nights at [[Wembley Arena]] in [[London]]. She then followed this with sold-out concert tour, [[Feels So Right Tour|Feels So Right Japan Tour]] in 1990 and [[I'm Your Baby Tonight World Tour]] in 1991.

With the enormous success of the film, [[The Bodyguard (1992 film)|The Bodyguard]], and its accompanying [[The Bodyguard: Original Soundtrack Album|soundtrack]], Houston went on her most extensive world tour, [[The Bodyguard World Tour]] to support her projects during 1993–1994.

In 1997, she embarked on [[Pacific Rim Tour|The Pacific Rim Tour]] which had her visiting for the first time [[Thailand]] and [[Taiwan]].

[[My Love Is Your Love World Tour]] was the highest grossing arena concert tour of the year in Europe while playing to almost half a million people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author = | url = http://www.allbusiness.com/media-telecommunications/movies-sound-recording/6714253-1.html | title = Whitney Houston World Tour '99 Becomes Europe's Highest Grossing Arena ever|publisher=Business Wire| date = October 19, 1999 | accessdate = September 25, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, Houston started [[Nothing but Love World Tour]], her first tour in over 10 years and supported her seventh and final studio album ''[[I Look to You]]''.

The '''Love Parade''' ({{lang-de|Loveparade}}) was a popular [[electronic dance music]] [[festival]] and [[technoparade]] that originated in 1989 in [[West Berlin]], [[Germany]].&lt;ref name=Borneman/&gt; It was held annually in [[Berlin]] from 1989 to 2003 and in 2006, then from 2007 to 2010 in the [[Ruhr]] region.

==History==
[[File:Liebende.jpg|thumb|Lovers on the Love Parade, 1999]]
The parade first occurred in July 1989, when 150 people took to the streets in [[Berlin]].&lt;ref name=Borneman/&gt; It was started by the Berlin underground at the initiative of [[Dr. Motte|Matthias Roeingh]] (also known as "Dr Motte") and his then girlfriend [[Danielle de Picciotto]].&lt;ref name=Borneman/&gt; It was conceived as a [[political demonstration]] for peace and international understanding through love and music.&lt;ref name=Borneman/&gt; It was supposed to be a bigger birthday party for Roeingh, and the motto ''Friede, Freude, Eierkuchen'' (in English&amp;nbsp;— ''Peace, Joy, Pancakes'') stood for [[disarmament]] (peace), music (joy) and a fair food production/distribution (pancakes). Roeingh dissociated himself from the parade in 2006 because of the [[commercialization]] of the event.

The parade was held on the Berlin [[Kurfürstendamm]] (avenue) until 1996. Because of overcrowding on the Kurfürstendamm, the festival moved to the [[Straße des 17. Juni]] in the [[Großer Tiergarten]] park in the center of Berlin. The festival became centered around the ''[[Siegessäule]]'' in the middle of the park; and the golden angel atop the column became the parade's emblem.

Many people from Germany and abroad traveled to Berlin to take part in the Parade&amp;nbsp;— over a million attended in the years 1997 through 2000 and 800,000 in 2001. Attendance at the 2001 festival was significantly lower because the date of the parade was changed with little advance notice. 2002 and 2003 also saw lower figures, and in 2004 and 2005 the parade was cancelled because of funding difficulties. The parade had inspired opposition because of the damage to the Tiergarten by participants, who were provided with insufficient toilet facilities. Opponents allegedly complicated matters for organisers by booking their own events in Berlin and so to exclude the parade from being able to register with city police. In 2004, however, a scaled-down version took place which served more as a mini-protest and was promoted with the title ''Love Weekend''. Dozens of clubs promoted the weekend-long event all over the city, with various clubs staying open for three days straight without closing.  In 2006, the parade made a comeback with the help of German exercise studio [[McFit]].

The Love Parade 2007 was planned for 7 July 2007 in Berlin. However, the Berlin event was cancelled in February because the [[Senate of Berlin]] did not issue the necessary permits at that time. After negotiations with several German cities, on 21 July, it was announced that the parade would move to the [[Ruhr Area]] for the next five years. The first event took place in [[Essen]] on 25 August. The parade in Essen saw 1.2 million visitors in comparison to the 500,000 who attended the 2006 parade in Berlin.

In 2008, the festival took place in [[Dortmund]] on 19 July on the [[Bundesstraße 1]] under the motto ''Highway of Love''. The event was planned as a "Love Weekend", with parties throughout the region. For the first time the Turkish electronic scene was represented by its own float, called "[[Turkish Delights (music project)|Turkish Delights]]". The official estimate is that 1.6 million visitors attended, making it the largest parade to date.&lt;ref&gt;

The 2009 event, planned for [[Bochum]], was cancelled; a year later, the deaths of 21 attendees at the [[Duisburg]] venue prompted the parade's organiser [[Rainer Schaller]] to declare an end to the festival.  "The Love Parade has always been a peaceful party, but it will forever be overshadowed by the accident, so out of respect for the victims the Love Parade will never take place again," Schaller said.&lt;ref name="guardian"/&gt;
The parade was one of the oldest and largest festivals of electronic music, together with [[Zürich]]'s [[Streetparade]], [[Mayday (music festival)|Mayday]] and [[Nature One]].

==Setup==
The music played at the events was predominantly electronic [[dance music]]&amp;nbsp;— in this case mainly [[trance music|trance]], [[house music|house]], [[techno music|techno]], and schranz music. Attempts to introduce other music styles, such as [[Hip hop music|hip hop]], have failed. Hardcore and gabber music were part of the parade in early years, but were later removed. They are now celebrated separately on a counter-demonstration called "[[Fuckparade]]".

The parade was seen to be louder and more crowded than most concerts. With its water-cooled sound systems on every truck, the parade produced an extremely loud sound floor.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} After the 2001 arrangement, [[veterinarian]]s at the [[Berlin Zoo]] blamed the parade for giving more than half of its animals [[diarrhea]]. Chairman Heiner Kloes said veterinarians told him the heavy bass was to blame for disturbing the animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.quiet.org/noiseletter/spring2003/page8.htm|title=Noiseletter - Spring 2003, Page 8|website=www.quiet.org|access-date=28 July 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080705055202/http://www.quiet.org/noiseletter/spring2003/page8.htm|archive-date=5 July 2008|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The parade consisted of the sound trucks that usually featured local, or important, clubs and their [[DJ]]s. It had become a rule that only trucks that had sponsors from a techno-related field, such as clubs, labels or stores, were allowed, but advertising space was increased after the 2006 event to offset the high costs of equipping a truck.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} The trucks were usually open on top and featured dancers, with box-systems mounted on the side or rear.

The parade was a place where some exhibited and enjoyed other people's [[exhibitionist]] tendencies.&lt;ref name=Borneman/&gt; Some attendees enjoyed carrying around toys such or other items such as dummies (pacifiers) or face masks. Often the crowd was imaginative in terms of clothing (or lack thereof) and appearance.

One famous picture from the parade is people sitting and dancing on streetlamps, trees, commercial signs, telephone booths, which gave the event's nickname "the greatest amateur circus on earth".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.rian.ru/world/20100724/159936810.html|title=At least 10 people killed, 15 injured at Love Parade in Germany - media (Update 1)|first=|last=Sputnik|website=en.rian.ru|access-date=19 November 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100727075941/http://en.rian.ru/world/20100724/159936810.html|archive-date=27 July 2010|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The demonstration concluded with the so-called "Abschlusskundgebung" which were sets of the world's leading top DJs such as [[DJ Tiesto]], [[Paul Van Dyk]], [[Carl Cox]], [[Armin Van Buuren]], [[DJ Rush]], [[DJ Hell]], [[Westbam]], [[Drum Connection]], [[Miss Djax]], [[Marusha]] or [[Chris Liebing]]. During this time all trucks (usually about 40) were connected to each other and set online to the statue of victory where the [[phonograph|turntables]] are. This was one of the few chances a DJ can ever have to play for a crowd of about one million people.

==Disturbances==
The parade was quite peaceful for an event of its size, seeing few arrests. In 2008, for example, charges were pressed for six robberies, three sexually related offences and forty thefts. Twenty-three participants were caught with drugs and forty-nine were charged with bodily harm. There were 177 parade visitors provisionally arrested by the police.&lt;ref&gt;

In 2000, after the parade, a girl under the influence of [[MDMA|ecstasy]] was run over by an [[S-Bahn]] after she had been leaning on the door too hard.

==2010 accident==
{{Main|Love Parade stampede}}
At the 2010 Love Parade in Duisburg, the number of people attending allegedly reached 1.4 million – the original expectation was around 800,000 – whereas police believed around 400,000 people were present.&lt;ref name="Spiegel.de"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/0,1518,708676,00.html |title=Love Parade Tragedy: No Resignations, Just Unanswered Questions&amp;nbsp;– SPIEGEL ONLINE&amp;nbsp;– News&amp;nbsp;– International |publisher=Spiegel.de |date=24 July 2010 |accessdate=28 July 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100727223908/http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/0,1518,708676,00.html |archive-date=27 July 2010 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; 21 people were killed, and more than 500 injured, in an incident on an overcrowded ramp leading from a tunnel into the festival. At least 20 casualties resulted from suffocation, caused by crowd pressure.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/analysis-of-the-love-parade-tragedy-the-facts-behind-the-duisburg-disaster-a-708876-8.html|title=The Facts Behind the Duisberg Disaster|last=Diehl|first=Jörg,  et.al.|date=July 28, 2010|work=Spiegel Online|access-date=January 24, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170323001837/http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/analysis-of-the-love-parade-tragedy-the-facts-behind-the-duisburg-disaster-a-708876-8.html|archive-date=23 March 2017|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Safety experts and a fire service investigator had previously warned that the site was not suitable for the numbers expected to attend.&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;Connolly, Kate (25 July 2010).  [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jul/25/germany "Prosecutors Investigate 'Ignored' Safety Warnings after 21 Die in Love Parade Crush&amp;nbsp;— Organisers Allowed Just One Entrance to Music Festival Grounds for Expected Crowd of 1.4 Million, Witnesses Say"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160308030453/http://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jul/25/germany |date=8 March 2016 }}.  ''[[The Guardian]]''. Retrieved 27 July 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rainer Schaller]], the festival's organizer and chief executive officer, later said the festival would not continue in future.

A preliminary investigation of the ministry of the interior placed heavy blame on the organizers around Rainer Schaller. Schaller in turn claimed that errors by the police in controlling streams of visitors led to the accident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rhein-zeitung.de/nachrichten/deutschland-und-welt_artikel,-Jetzt-21-Tote-durch-Loveparade-Katastrophe-_arid,117302.html |title=Jetzt 21 Tote durch Loveparade-Katastrophe&amp;nbsp;– Deutschland &amp; Welt&amp;nbsp;– Rhein-Zeitung |publisher=Rhein-zeitung.de |date= |accessdate=28 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar festivals have taken place in other cities of Germany and many other countries worldwide. Large spin-off festivals in Europe include [[Zürich]]'s [[Street Parade]], [[Geneva]]'s [[Lake Parade]], [[Paris]]'s Techno Parade, [[Rotterdam]]'s FFWD Dance Parade, [[Munich]]'s [[Union Move]], [[Hamburg]]'s Generation Move, [[Hannover]]'s Reincarnation, [[Bremen]]'s Vision Parade and the Love Parade and the Freeparade in [[Vienna]]. In 1994, 1995 and 1996 an event called Love Parade was held in Melbourne, Australia. Unlike its overseas counterparts, this was a smaller "rave party" version of the festival. In 1996 it was held at [[Festival Hall (Melbourne)|Festival Hall]] in  West Melbourne and included a parade that made the evening news. It was followed in 1997 by a Love Parade in Sydney, Australia, likewise a smaller rave party, held at the infamous Graffiti Hall of Fame in Redfern. In 1999 and 2000 technoparades named "Buenos Aires Energy Parade" took place in [[Buenos Aires]], [[Argentina]] under the motto "Love, Peace and Dance". On Saturday 8 July 2000 a Love Parade was held in [[Roundhay Park]], [[Leeds]], [[United Kingdom]] sponsored by [[BBC Radio 1]]. In 2001, the official UK parade had moved to [[Newcastle upon Tyne]] which was to have seen a parade through the streets of Newcastle before ending up on [[Town Moor, Newcastle upon Tyne|Town Moor]] but was cancelled after the police refused a license: BBC Radio 1 still hosted a more contained event, however.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/tyne/loveparade/love_parade_newcastle_2001.shtml |title=Tyne&amp;nbsp;– Love Parade |publisher=BBC |date= |accessdate=28 July 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151016005152/http://www.bbc.co.uk/tyne/loveparade/love_parade_newcastle_2001.shtml |archive-date=16 October 2015 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since then no Love Parade has taken place in the United Kingdom. In Summer 2000 one of the first public events that took place in post-war Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina, was Futura, Festival of Electronic Music. Some of the world's most famous DJs, including the organizers of the Berlin Love Parade, performed in a bombed and burnt out factory.

After being held in the North-American Continent for the first time in Mexico (2002), in the fall of 2004 the Love Parade was held in [[San Francisco]]. They had held their inaugural Parade in September 2004 with 37,000 attending. The parade was held again in San Francisco in September 2005 as a rousing success drawing over 50–60,000 people. In 2006, the parade was held on 23 September and was renamed Love Fest because the Loveparade Berlin organization did not renew any of their worldwide licenses not already under contract so they could focus on their own event. 2009 was the biggest success of the parade now renamed [[Lovevolution]] with over 100,000 people. The first Love Parade in Santiago was held in 2005 and gathered over 100,000 people; the 2006 version gathered over 200,000 people. The first Love Parade in Caracas was held in June 2007 and gathered over 25,000 people.

==Legal issues==
Under [[German law]] the state has to pay for security during political demonstrations as well as cleaning up the streets after the demonstration.&lt;ref name=Borneman&gt;John Borneman &amp; Stefan Senders, "Politics without a Head: Is the "Love Parade" a New Form of Political Identification?" ''Cultural Anthropology'' J5(2) 294-31, American Anthropological Association. 2000&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of a commercial event however, the organizer must cover these expenses. For a large event like the Love Parade the costs are quite high: an estimated €300,000 to €400,000.&lt;ref name=Borneman/&gt;

The Love Parade was initially held as a political demonstration to save costs; however it was organized by two companies set up just for the Love Parade.&lt;ref name=Borneman/&gt; Due to this there was a dispute between the organizers and the city of Berlin every year about the status of the Love Parade and who should bear what costs.&lt;ref name=Borneman/&gt; Finally in 2001, the courts ruled that the Love Parade had to be held as commercial event.&lt;ref name=Mayer&gt;Florian Mayer, "Origins, Commodification, and Significance of Berlin's Love Parade" GRIN Verlag, 2007. {{ISBN|978-3638815796}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Religion in ancient Rome|ancient Roman religion]], the '''Mamuralia''' or '''''Sacrum Mamurio''''' ("Rite for Mamurius") was a [[Roman festivals|festival]] held on March 14 or 15, named only in sources from [[late antiquity]]. According to [[Joannes Lydus]], an old man wearing animal skins was beaten ritually with sticks.&lt;ref&gt;Michele Renee Salzman, ''On Roman Time: The Codex-Calendar of 354 and the Rhythms of Urban Life in Late Antiquity'' (University of California Press, 1990), pp. 124 and 128–129; [[William Warde Fowler]], ''The Roman Festivals of the Period of the Republic'' (London, 1908), pp. 44–50.&lt;/ref&gt; The name is connected to '''Mamurius Veturius''', who according to tradition was the craftsman who made the ritual shields (''[[ancile|ancilia]]'') that hung in the temple of [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]]. Because the [[Roman calendar]] originally began in March, the ''Sacrum Mamurio'' is usually regarded as a ritual marking the transition from the old year to the new. It shares some characteristics with [[scapegoat]] or [[pharmakos|''pharmakos'' ritual]].

==The craft of Mamurius==
According to legend, Mamurius was commissioned by [[Numa Pompilius|Numa]], second [[king of Rome]], to make eleven shields identical to the sacred ''ancile'' that fell from the heavens as a pledge of Rome's destiny to rule the world. The ''[[ancile]]'' was one of the sacred guarantors of the Roman state ''([[pignora imperii]])'',&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Rykwert, ''The Idea of a Town: The Anthropology of Urban Form in Rome, Italy and the Ancient World (MIT Press, 1976, 1988), p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt; and the replicas were intended to conceal the identity of the original and so prevent its theft; it was thus a kind of "public secret."&lt;ref&gt;In the terminology of [[Michael Taussig]], as discussed by Thomas Habinek, ''The World of Roman Song: From Ritualized Speech to Social Order'' (Johns Hopkins University Press, 2005), p. 10ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

The shields were under the care of Mars' priests the [[Salii]], who used them in their rituals. As payment, Mamurius requested that his name be preserved and remembered in the song sung by the Salii, the ''[[Carmen Saliare]]'', as they executed movements with the shields and performed their armed dance.&lt;ref&gt;The ancient sources for the story of Mamurius include [[Livy]] 1.20; [[Ovid]], ''Fasti'' 3&lt;!--lines needed--&gt;; [[Plutarch]], ''Life of Numa'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Numa*.html#13 13], Bill Thayer's edition at [[LacusCurtius]].&lt;/ref&gt; Fragments of this archaic [[hymn]] survive, including the [[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#invocatio|invocation]] of Mamurius.&lt;ref&gt;See C. M. Zander's 1888 edition, ''Carminis Saliaris reliquiae'', p. 8 [https://books.google.com/books?id=nZ0e_XDPz6EC&amp;pg=PA1&amp;dq=%22Carmen+Saliare%22&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;num=100&amp;as_brr=3&amp;cd=23#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Carmen%20Saliare%22&amp;f=false online], with notes (in Latin).&lt;/ref&gt; Several sources mention the invocation of the hymn and the story of the smith, but only Lydus describes the ritual as the beating of an old man.

Mamurius was also supposed to have made a [[bronze sculpture|bronze]] replacement for a [[maple]] statue of [[Vertumnus]], brought to Rome in the time of Romulus.&lt;ref&gt;[[Propertius]] 4.2; Daniel P. Harmon, "Religion in the Latin Elegists", ''Aufstieg und Niedergang der römischen Welt'' 2.16.3 (1986), pp. 1960–61.&lt;/ref&gt; He may have been [[Osci|Oscan]] and thought to have been buried in his homeland, since at the end of a poem about Vertumnus, [[Propertius]] has the god express a wish that the Oscan earth should not wear away Mamurius's skilled hands.&lt;ref&gt;W.A. Camps, ''Propertius: Elegies Book IV'' (Cambridge University Press, 1968), p. 77.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Veturia (gens)|Veturius]]'' is considered either an [[Etruscans|Etruscan]] or [[Osco-Umbrian languages|Oscan]] family name.&lt;ref&gt;John F. Hall, "From Tarquins to Caesars: Etruscan Governance at Rome," in ''Etruscan Italy: Etruscan Influences on the Civilizations of Italy from Antiquity to the Modern Era'' (Indiana University Press, 1996), p. 179.&lt;/ref&gt;

"Mamurius Veturius" became the nickname of [[Marcus Aurelius Marius|Marcus Aurelius Marius Augustus]], a former smith or metalworker who was briefly [[Roman emperor]] in 269.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Historia Augusta]]'' 2.104. Habinek, ''The World of Roman Song,'' p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Calendar and name==
The divine shield is supposed to have fallen from the sky on March 1, the first day of the [[Martius (month)|month ''Martius'']], named after the god [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]]. In the earliest Roman calendar, which the Romans believed to have been instituted by [[Romulus]], the ten-month year began with Mars' month, and the god himself was thus associated with the agricultural year and the cycle of life and death. The number of ''ancilia'' corresponds to the twelve months in the reformed calendar attributed to Numa, and scholars often interpret the Mamuralia as originally a [[New Year]] festival, with various explanations as to how it was moved from the beginning of the month to the midpoint.

The Mamuralia is named as such only in calendars and sources dating from the 4th century of the [[Christian era]] and later.&lt;ref&gt;Fowler, ''Roman Festivals'', p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt; On the [[Calendar of Filocalus]] (354 AD), it is placed on March 14, but by Lydus on the [[Ides of March|Ides]]. The earliest extant calendars place an [[Equirria]], one of the sacral [[chariot races]] in honor of Mars, on March 14.&lt;ref&gt;Fowler, ''Roman Festivals'', p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt; The festival of [[Anna Perenna]], a goddess of the year (''annus''), took place on the Ides. [[Macrobius]] understood her doubled name to mean "through the year" (''perennis'', English "perennial").&lt;ref&gt;Robert Schilling, "Anna Perenna," in ''Roman and European Mythologies'' (University of Chicago Press, 1992, from the French edition of 1981), p. 112.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jane Ellen Harrison]] regarded Anna Perenna as the female equivalent of Mamurius, representing the [[lunar year]] to his [[solar year]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Jane Ellen Harrison]], ''Themis'' (Cambridge University Press, 1912, 1927), p. 198. The Hellenist Harrison treats Ovid's long discursive exploration of the political and mythological aspects of Anna Perenna in the ''[[Fasti (Ovid)|Fasti]]'' as a "rubbish heap" of "conjectures."&lt;/ref&gt; The Ides were supposed to be determined by the [[full moon]], reflecting the [[lunar calendar|lunar origin of the Roman calendar]]. On the earliest calendar, the [[Ides of March]] would have been the first full moon of the new year.&lt;ref&gt;[[H.H. Scullard]], ''Festivals and Ceremonies of the Roman Republic'' (Cornell University Press, 1981), pp. 42–43.&lt;/ref&gt;

H.S. Versnel has argued that adjustments made to the calendar over time caused the Mamuralia to be moved from an original place as the last day of the year (the day before the [[Kalends]] of March) to the day before the Ides, causing the Equirria on February 27 to be repeated on March 14. Mamurius in this view was associated with ''[[Februarius]]'', the month of purifications and care of the dead that originally ended the year, and represented concepts of [[lustrum|lustration]], [[rites of passage]], and [[liminality]].&lt;ref&gt;H.S. Versnel, ''Inconsistencies in Greek and Roman Religion: Transition and Reversal in Myth and Ritual'' (Brill, 1993, 1994), vol. 2, pp. 301–304.&lt;/ref&gt;

Because the name ''Veturius'' can be explained as related to Latin ''vetus, veteris'', "old," the ritual figure of Mamurius has often been interpreted as a [[personification]] of the [[Father Time|Old Year]], and the rite as its expulsion.&lt;ref&gt;[[Georges Dumézil]], ''Déesses latines et mythes védiques'', Collection Latomus 25 (Brussels, 1956), p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Mamurius'' may be a form of ''Mamers'', the name of Mars in [[Oscan language|Oscan]] ([[Latin]] ''Mavors''). The Roman personal name [[Mamercus (praenomen)|Mamercus]] was derived from ''Mamers'', which was itself formed from [[Reduplication|doubling]] the [[vocative]] stem of the god's name; ''Mamurius'' would thus be related to the vocative ''Marmar'' in the ''[[Carmen Arvale]]'', the cult song of the [[Arval Brothers]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Hendrik Wagenvoort]], "Characteristic Traits of Ancient Roman Religion," in ''Pietas: Selected Studies in Roman Religion'' (Brill, 1980), p. 242.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Mamurius Veturius'' would be "old Mars" as the embodiment of the year.

The [[Roman Republic#Late Republic (147 BC – 30 BC)|late Republican]] scholar [[Varro]], however, takes the name ''Mamuri Veturi'' as it appears in the Salian song and analyzes it within a [[semantic field]] pertaining to "memory", deriving the [[Reduplication|reduplicative verb]] ''meminisse'' ("to remember") from ''memoria'' ("memory"), "because that which has remained in the mind is again moved." He also places the [[causative verb]] ''monêre'', "to warn, advise, remind," in this same group, explaining that the verbal action is meant to create a memory or ''monimenta'', "monument(s)." Therefore, Varro says, when the Salii chant ''Mamuri Veturi'', they are symbolically referring ''(significant)'' to archaic memory.&lt;ref&gt;[[Varro]], ''De lingua latina'' 6.49: "''Meminisse,'' 'to remember,' comes from ''memoria'', 'memory,' since there is once again movement back to that which has stayed in the mind; this may have been derived from ''manere,'' 'to remain,' like ''manimoria''. And thus the Salii when they sing 'O Mamurius Veturius' signify a ''memoria'', 'memory'. From the same word comes ''monere'', 'remind,' because he who reminds is just like memory; so are derived ''monimenta'', 'memorials'" ''(Meminisse a memoria, cum &lt;in&gt; id quod remansit in mente rursus movetur; quae a manendo ut manimoria potest esse dicta. Itaque Salii quod cantant: ''Mamuri Veturi'', significant memoriam veterem. Ab eodem monere, quod is qui monet, proinde sit ac memoria; sic monimenta … )'', as translated in Mary Jaeger, ''Livy's Written Rome'' (University of Michigan Press, 1997), p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Plutarch]], in an extended passage on the shields in his ''Life of Numa'', also notes that Mamurius was invoked by the Salii, but that "some say" the phrase means not the name, but ''veterem memoriam'', an "ancient remembrance."&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''Life of Numa'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Numa*.html#13 13.7.] In his edition at [[LacusCurtius]], Bill Thayer notes that the [[Loeb Classical Library]] has "Mamertius."&lt;/ref&gt;

[[William Warde Fowler]], in his 1899 work on Roman festivals, agreed with [[Theodor Mommsen|Mommsen]] that the story of Mamurius might be "one of those comparatively rare examples of later ritual growing itself out of myth." The name of ''Mamurius'' as chanted by the Salii in March may have become attached to the March 14 Equirria, which is omitted from sources that list the Mamuralia.&lt;ref&gt;Fowler, ''Roman Festivals'', pp. 44–49; Lesley Adkins and Roy A Adkins, ''Handbook to Life in Ancient Rome'' (Oxford University Press, 1998), p. 283.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ritual==
The fullest description of the ritual known as the Mamuralia is given by [[Joannes Lydus]] in his 6th-century work ''De mensibus'' ("Regarding the Months"). Lydus records that an old man, addressed as Mamurius, was clothed in animal skins and beaten with white sticks,&lt;ref&gt;[[John Lydus]], ''De mensibus'' 4.36.&lt;/ref&gt; meaning branches that have been peeled, stripped of bark;&lt;ref&gt;Fowler, ''Roman Festivals'', p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt; in a [[structuralism|structuralist]] interpretation, the peeled sticks thus reverse the covering of smooth human flesh with rough animal hides.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} Lydus does not state that the old man was driven out of the city, but scholars generally infer that he was. As portrayed in the myth of the ''ancilia,'' the craftsman Mamurius would seem to be a beneficent figure, and his punishment unearned.&lt;ref&gt;Pierre Grimal, ''The Dictionary of Classical Mythology'' (Blackwell, 1996, originally published 1951 in French), p. 271.&lt;/ref&gt;

The lateness of this account has raised questions about the festival's authenticity or antiquity, since references in [[Roman Republic|Republican]] and [[Roman Empire|Imperial]] calendars or literary sources are absent or oblique.&lt;ref&gt;Fowler, ''Roman Festivals'', p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt; Lydus may have misunderstood descriptions of the Salian rites. [[Servius]] says that a day was consecrated to Mamurius on which the Salii "struck a hide in imitation of his art," that is, the blows struck by a smith.&lt;ref&gt;Servius, note to ''[[Aeneid]]'' 7.188, as cited by Fowler, ''Roman Festivals,'' p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt; A passage from [[Minucius Felix]] indicates that the Salii struck skins as the shields were carried in procession.&lt;ref&gt;Minucius Felix, ''Octavius'' 24.3, as cited by Fowler, ''Roman Festivals,'' p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt; Two [[Roman mosaic|mosaic]]s of the [[Roman Empire|Imperial era]] have been interpreted as illustrating the rite of Mamurius.&lt;ref&gt;H. Stern, "Note sur deux images du mois de Mars," ''REL'' 52 (1974) 70–74.&lt;/ref&gt; The calendar mosaic from [[El Djem]], [[Tunisia]] ([[Africa (Roman province)|Roman Africa]]), which places March as the first month, shows three men using sticks to beat an animal hide.

Lydus's understanding of Mamurius may be connected to medieval lore of the [[wodewose]] or wild man of the wood, who could play a similar role in winter or new year ceremonies pertaining to [[Twelfth Night (holiday)|Twelfth Night]] and [[carnival]].&lt;ref&gt;Alison Williams, ''Tricksters and Prankster: Roguery in French and German Literature of the Middle Ages and the Renaissance'' (Rodopi, 2000), p. 125.&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Statua Mamuri''==
A bronze statue of Mamurius stood near the Temple of [[Quirinus]] along the [[Alta Semita]], in [[14 regions of Augustan Rome#VI: Alta Semita|Regio VI]]. It is likely to have been connected with the ''Curia Saliorum Collinorum,'' the ''[[curia]]'' of the Colline Salii, who may have dedicated it.&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence Richardson, ''A New Topographical Dictionary of Ancient Rome'' (Johns Hopkins University Press, 1992), p. 370.&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Clivus Mamurius''==
"Mamurius Street" appears in medieval records, and took its name from the statue. According to [[Pomponio Leto]], the [[Italian humanism|Italian humanist]], the statue and "Mamurius's neighborhood" ''([[Vicus]] Mamuri)'' were at the Church of S. Susanna on the [[Quirinal Hill]], though the regionary catalogues locate it nearer the Capitolium Vetus.&lt;ref&gt;Richardson, ''New Topographical Dictionary,'' p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Das_Nationale_Freiheits_und_Einheitsdenkmal.jpg|thumb|The monument viewed from the Schinkelplatz]]
The '''Monument to Freedom and Unity''' (''{{lang-de|Denkmal für Freiheit und Einheit}}'') is a planned national German monument in [[Berlin]] commemorating the country's peaceful [[German reunification|reunification]] in 1990 and earlier 18th, 19th and 20th century unification movements.

It was agreed on 9 November 2007 by a decree of the [[Bundestag]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://dip21.bundestag.de/dip21/btd/16/069/1606974.pdf Deutscher Bundestag, Drucksache 16/6974]&lt;/ref&gt; The decree proposed the site of the former [[National Kaiser Wilhelm Monument]] on the ''Schlossfreiheit'' for the new structure, next to the site of the [[City Palace, Berlin|City Palace Berlin]] that is reconstructed since 2013. The monument would carry on its surface the slogans of the 1989 demonstrations: "''Wir sind das Volk, Wir sind ein Volk''" which means (We are the People, We are one People).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2011/apr/18/berlin-monument-wall-fall|title=Berlin selects giant rocking dish as monument to unification|author=Abby d'Arcy Hughes|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=19 April 2011|accessdate=19 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early June 2017, the Bundestag decided to start construction of the memorial in front of the City Palace according to the design of Milla &amp; Partner. It is to be inaugurated on the 30th anniversary of the [[fall of the Berlin Wall]] on 9 November 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.tagesspiegel.de/kultur/einheitsdenkmal-in-berlin-bundestag-segnet-die-wippe-ab/19883712.html|title=Bundestag segnet die Wippe ab|author=Christiane Peitz|work=[[Der Tagesspiegel]]|language=German|date=2 June 2016|accessdate=23 August 2017}}

One objection to the use of the term is that it dehumanizes Palestinians. Ron Ben-Tovim argues that it is a supermarket label used as a euphemism for violent acts aimed to instill terror into the hearts of Palestinians,  applied to acts against Palestinians by Jews, whereas  it is standard in Israeli usage to brand all acts perpetrated by Palestinians against Israeli Jews as terrorism. “Cutting off the head of the terror snake” and “tentacles of terror" are commonly used metaphors. To use a special term, "price tag" for acts of violence against Palestinians is to reduce the terror to a message by settlers to their government, and ignore the victim.&lt;ref&gt;Ron Ben-Tovim [http://www.haaretz.com/beta/.premium-1.669675 'Stop Calling Hate Crimes 'price Tag Attacks' It's Offensive,']  [[Haaretz]] 5 August 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the military correspondent of the Israeli newspaper ''[[Haaretz]]'' Amos Harel, the roots of the policy go back to [[Ariel Sharon]]'s policy of [[Israel's unilateral disengagement plan|disengagement from Gaza]] in August 2005 and the demolition in 2006 of the illegal settlement at [[Amona, Mateh Binyamin|Amona]]. The expression is occasionally used for acts that took place before this date, to denote a retributive act. [[Gideon Levy]], for example, describes the settlement of [[Mitzpe Yair]], established in 1998 after the murder of settler Yair Har-Sinai, as "an early 'price tag' operation – an act of retribution for some incident."&lt;ref&gt;[[Gideon Levi]], [http://www.haaretz.com/weekend/week-s-end/not-sacred-not-stolen.premium-1.463428 'Not sacred, not stolen,'] at [[Haaretz]], 7 September 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The term has been also used to describe Israeli retaliative policy against Palestinians, and on behalf of the settler enterprise, by describing PM [[Binjamin Netanyahu]]'s decision to permit Jews to move into a contested property, Machpela House, in response to the shooting of an Israeli border policeman near the [[Tomb of the Patriarchs]] in [[Hebron]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Haaretz|Haaretz editorial]], [http://www.haaretz.com/opinion/1.548619 'A governmental price tag attack,'] at [[Haaretz]] 24 September 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Kahane Chai]] member and IDF soldier [[Eden Natan-Zada]]'s gunning down of Israeli Arabs on a bus in the town of [[Shfar'am]], in which four Arabs were killed and twenty-two were wounded, took place on 4 August 2005, just before the Gaza evacuation, and has been interpreted as a possible price-tag assault aimed at provoking riots that would make the IDF too busy to execute the evacuation on the [[Gaza Strip]].&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Byman, ''A High Price: The Triumphs and Failures of Israeli Counterterrorism,'' Oxford University Press, 2011 p.290.&lt;/ref&gt; Later that same year, [[Asher Weisgan]] of the [[Shilo, Mateh Binyamin|Shilo]]h settlement killed four Palestinians in a similar terror attack perpetrated as a "protest" at the withdrawal from Amona.&lt;ref&gt;Byman, 2011 p.290-1&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Harel, since the Gaza and Amona withdrawals&lt;blockquote&gt;"the extreme right has sought to establish a 'balance of terror,' in which every state action aimed at them – from demolishing a caravan in an outpost to restricting the movements of those suspected of harassing Palestinian olive harvesters – generates an immediate, violent reaction."&lt;ref&gt;Amos Harel, [http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/news/analysis-the-extreme-right-has-sought-to-establish-a-balance-of-terror-1.256501 ANALYSIS: The extreme right has sought to establish a 'balance of terror'], in [[Haaretz]], 3 November 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In July 2008, after the evacuation of a bus from the [[Israeli outpost]] of Adei Ad (עֲדֵי עַד), followed by clashes between settler groups with Palestinians and the IDF, settler Itay Zar from the Israeli outpost of [[Havat Gilad]] alluded to the price-tag policy in stating: "Whenever an evacuation is carried out – whether it is a bus, a trailer or a small outpost – we will respond."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ynet.co.il/articles/0,7340,L-3572983,00.html|title=המתנחלים אחרי יצהר: נקבע "תג מחיר" לפינויים|date=25 July 2008|publisher=|accessdate=19 April 2017|via=Ynet}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an article published in May 2010, Zar stated that these actions represent a legitimate struggle which includes mainly the blocking of intersections and roads in order to disrupt the regular operations of Israeli security forces, preventing them from demolishing settler houses. Zar referred to the criminal activity involved in these actions as "marginal and uncontrolled acts."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inn.co.il/Besheva/Article.aspx/9454|title=להפסיק לגנות ולהתחיל לבנות - דעות|publisher=|accessdate=19 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the wake of the dismantlement of [[Noam Federman]]'s farm outside Hebron in October 2008, opponents of the evacuation called for revenge attacks against the security forces, telling soldiers "you should all be defeated by your enemies, you should all become [[Gilad Shalit]], you should all be killed, you should all be slaughtered, because that's what you deserve", and "set a price tag" on the event by stoning soldiers and local Palestinians, wounding two [[Border police]] officers, vandalizing cars, and destroying graves in a Muslim graveyard.&lt;ref&gt;Haaretz Editorial, [http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/opinion/defeat-settler-terror-1.256093 'Defeat settler terror'], Haaretz, 27 October 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Price tag operations were originally envisaged as mobilizing actions by settlers throughout the West Bank – retaliating in the north when outposts in the south were threatened with dismantlement, and "exacting a price" in the south when outposts risked removal in the north. However, by 2009, though considerable damage was wrought to Palestinian property and persons, a coordinated north-south campaign still hadn't been realised. Price tag attacks could, furthermore, also be triggered purely on the basis of an announcement of government measures or by rumours of an imminent evacuation.&lt;ref name="OCHA, 1 November 2009"&gt;[[OCHA]], 1 November 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Settlers have used the term to describe Israeli government operations that demolish the illegal structures they have built.&lt;ref&gt;Yoav Zitun and Itay Blumenthal, [http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4508005,00.html 'Six Border Policemen hurt, IDF post destroyed in settlers' rampage near Yitzhar,'] [[Ynet]] 8 April 2014:'The Border Policemen had begun to demolish illegal structures at the settlement when local residents began throwing stones at the troops. Two police officers required medical attention. Settlers at Yitzhar slammed the demolition as a "price tag" attack carried out by the military in revenge for attacks on Israeli security personnel in recent days.'&lt;/ref&gt;

The acts of random violence generally follow actions by Israeli authorities that are perceived as harming the settlement enterprise, or follow Palestinian violence against settlers. "Price tag" acts include [[Demonstration (people)|demonstrations]], [[Roadblock|blocking of roads]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.inn.co.il/News/News.aspx/182410 Price Tag blocking intersections throughout the West Bank and Israel]&lt;/ref&gt; clashes with Israeli security forces and even attacks against Israeli security forces personnel. Usually, however, the term refers to actions carried out by radical right-wing Israeli activists against Palestinians and their property. These include throwing stones at Palestinian cars, the torching of Palestinian fields and orchards, as well as the destruction and uprooting of trees belonging to Palestinians.

According to Israeli human rights group, [[Yesh Din]], "The goal is to create a price for each evacuation, causing the Israeli authorities to think twice about carrying them out."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/middle_east/article6721173.ece|title=Israeli settlers burn olive groves in ‘price tag’ retaliation attack|date=21 July 2009|work=The Times |location=UK|author=Sheera Frenkel}}&lt;/ref&gt; A September 2011 article in ''The Economist'' suggested that one motive for these attacks might be to instigate violent Palestinian reaction, because the settlers are better-armed and believe that they could defeat the Palestinians.&lt;ref name=economist&gt;{{cite news| title = The West Bank : Villagers v settlers|work=The Economist| url = http://www.economist.com/node/21530175| date = September 2011| quote= By night, activists exact what they call "price-tags", for instance by defiling mosques, in the hope of provoking a conflict which the well-armed settlers feel sure they could win.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Towards the end of 2009, following an Israeli government decision to freeze any Israeli construction in the West Bank for a period of 10 months, several suspicious attacks were carried out in the West Bank,&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ynet.co.il/articles/0,7340,L-3816739,00.html|title=נקמה במכוניות בירושלים: "נקפיא גם אתכם"|date=8 December 2009|publisher=|accessdate=19 April 2017|via=Ynet}}&lt;/ref&gt; including the arson of a mosque in the Palestinian town of [[Yasuf]], during which [[graffiti]] was sprayed on a building saying "Prepare for the price tag". The [[Shin Bet]] estimates of the extent of the perpetrator group vary: one figure calculates that from several hundred to about 3,000 people implement the price tag policy,&lt;ref name="inn.co.il"/&gt; while a recent analysis sets the figure at a few dozen individuals backed a few hundred right-wing activists.&lt;ref name=autogenerated7 /&gt;  The vast majority of the settlers reject such actions, Shin Bet officials say.  The perpetrators are organized in small close-knit and well-organised cells.&lt;ref name=autogenerated13 /&gt;

A 2009 summary report published by the Israeli police stated that during 2009 there was a decline in these types of attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inn.co.il/News/News.aspx/207485|title=ירידה בהיקף "תג מחיר"|publisher=|accessdate=19 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Request quote|date=April 2013}} According to a report of the [[Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs]] (OCHA) published in November 2009, if Israel were to begin evacuating settlements in the West Bank, 248,700 Palestinians living in 83 communities would be exposed to this policy, of which 22 communities with 75,900 inhabitants would be at high risk.&lt;ref name="OCHA, 1 November 2009"/&gt;

According to [[Yesh Din]], which monitored a selection of incidents over 4 years, Israel Police did not file a single indictment following 69 cases that included price tag operations, where thousands of olive trees were burnt down between 2005 and 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[[Human Rights Watch]] [https://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/reports/iopt1210webwcover_0.pdf Separate and Unequal Israel’s Discriminatory Treatment of Palestinians in the Occupied Palestinian Territories,'] Human Rights Watch, December 2010 p.99.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[OCHA]], 1 November 2009:"The lack of adequate law enforcement and accountability in regard to settler violence has been recurrently pointed out, since the early 1980s, by official commissions appointed by the Israeli authorities, as well as by human rights organizations.."&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Reuters]], there was a 57% upswing in such attacks in the first seven months of 2011. No charges had yet been brought against suspects in price tag incidents.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, Uri, [http://www.theatlanticwire.com/global/2011/10/price-tag-menace-vigilante-israeli-settler-attacks-spread/43226/ The 'Price Tag' Menace: Vigilante Israeli Settler Attacks Spread]. October 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2011 the [[Shin Beit]] advised the government to withhold funding from one [[yeshiva]], [[Od Yosef Chai]] in the settlement of [[Yitzhar]], on the basis of intelligence reports that its rabbis encourage students to attack Arabs, including 'price tag' assaults.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/news/shin-bet-urges-israeli-government-to-halt-funding-of-west-bank-yeshiva-1.386892|title=Shin Bet Urges Israeli Government to Halt Funding of West Bank Yeshiva|first1=Chaim|last1=Levinson|first2=Amos|last2=Harel|date=27 September 2011|publisher=|accessdate=19 April 2017|via=Haaretz}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Price tag attacks have been made on Christian holy sites. In response to one on the [[Dormition Abbey]] on [[Mount Zion]] early in October 2012, [http://www.timesofisrael.com/topic/gilad-kariv/ Rabbi Gilad Kariv] commented:"This price tag epidemic threatens to become a routine part of Israeli public life, causing moral, social and international damage. Law enforcement, which has failed to deal with the phenomenon, must make this a much higher priority than it has until now." &lt;ref&gt;Oz Rosenberg and Nir Hasson, [http://www.haaretz.com/news/national/another-israeli-church-defaced-with-price-tag-graffiti-1.467930 'Another Israeli church defaced with 'price tag' graffiti,'] at [[Haaretz]], 3 October 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;
In December 2012, two [[yarmulke]]-clad youths, one a candidate for the Shin Bet security service, handed out flyers, promoting price-tag attacks against Palestinians, at an [[Israel Defense Forces|IDF]] induction centre in [[Tel Hashomer]].  The IDF issued a statement condemning political propaganda within the army, the centre was notified and the distribution of flyers stopped.&lt;ref&gt;Gili Cohen [http://www.haaretz.com/news/national/activists-hand-out-fliers-promoting-price-tag-attacks-at-idf-center-1.482140 'Activists hand out fliers promoting 'price tag' attacks at IDF center,'] at Haaretz, 3 December 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Daniel Byman and Natan Sachs, writing for the [[Council on Foreign Relations]]'s in-house journal [[Foreign Affairs]], state that arson and the destruction of trees do not belong in the same category and aren't morally equivalent to suicide bombing though they, as well as Israeli politicians such as [[Moshe Ya'alon]],&lt;ref name="Misgav" /&gt; define these acts of vandalism as a form of [[terrorism]].&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Byman and Natan Sachs, [http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/137825/daniel-byman-and-natan-sachs/the-rise-of-settler-terrorism%3Fpage%3Dshow 'The Rise of Settler Terrorism: The West Bank’s Other Violent Extremists,'], at [[Foreign Affairs]], 12 August 2012: 'To be clear, arson and the destruction of trees do not belong in the same category as suicide bombings, and using the word "terrorism" to describe such vandalism risks moral equivalency. Yet "terrorism" is defined not only by the act itself but also by its purpose: to produce a psychological effect, terror, as a means of advancing a political agenda. This definition fits the aim of extremist settlers, who often scrawl the Hebrew words for "price tag" at the scene of the crime -- a message to their targets that they will exact a price for any act that they oppose. Such attacks target innocent Palestinians in response to and as a deterrent against Palestinian terrorism and target Palestinians, pro-peace Israelis, and Israeli soldiers alike for supposedly anti-settlement measures taken by the Israeli government. By seeking to frighten a rival population and intimidate a government, the extremists mimic the typical methods of terrorist groups across the globe.'&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2013, according to [[Zehava Gal-On]], the Israeli Cabinet was pressured, despite a recommendation by the Attorney-General to the contrary, to define perpetrators of such attacks as members of "forbidden organizations" as opposed to "terror groups". The implications are significant, in that belonging to the latter carries prison sentences of up to 20 years, whereas "forbidden organizations" only risk confiscation of their property, and under the definition, arrested members of price tag activist groups can avoid criminal prosecution.&lt;ref name="Jonathan Lis" /&gt;

=== Allegations of staged price tag attacks ===

Israeli settlers were accused by an Arab farmer of having gathered his sheep into an area thick with brush and setting fire to the bushes, burning alive his 12 pregnant ewes.

=== Jewish settler stages fake Palestinian attack ===
In July 2013 an Israeli settler was arrested by police for staging a 'price tag' assault on his own car. While visiting his family at the [[Kiryat Moshe]] neighbourhood in Jerusalem, he phoned the police to complain that someone had slashed the tires of his car and sprayed it with Arabic graffiti reading 'slaughter the Jews' (''itbah al-Yahud''). Investigations led to an admission that he himself was responsible for the damage and the motivation for the act was to "raise awareness" about Arab price tag acts conducted against Jews.&lt;ref&gt;Noam (Dabul) Dvir ,[http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4404163,00.html 'Settler sprays 'slaughter Jews' on own car,'] at [[Ynet]], 12 July 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Police investigations ==
The Israeli government has set up a national task force, forming part of the elite Lahav police unit, to coordinate investigations and gather intelligence on these attacks.&lt;ref&gt;Yaakov Lappin, Melanie Lidman, [http://www.jpost.com/NationalNews/Article.aspx%3Fid%3D273512 'E. J'lem cars vandalized in suspected far-right attack,'] at [[Jerusalem Post]], 12 June 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Allocated 80 positions, the price tag crimes unit has, after 18 months, filled them with 30 police officers, only for operations in the West Bank.&lt;ref&gt;Chaim Levinson,  [http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/israel-police-creates-unit-to-fight-price-tag-attacks-but-only-in-west-bank.premium-1.531950 'Israel Police creates unit to fight 'price tag' attacks - but only in West Bank,'] at [[Haaretz]] 26 June 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

After a number of mosques were torched over 2011, all suspects subsequently detailed were later released, since law enforcement officers encountered difficulties in securing evidence against them.&lt;ref&gt;Chaim Levinson, Jonathan Lis,[http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/news/israel-police-denies-provocateurs-operating-among-settlers-1.405724,'Israel police denies provocateurs operating among settlers,'] at [[Haaretz]], January 6, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dan Halutz]], former chief of staff of the Israeli Army, in June 2012, commented to [[Army Radio (Israel)|Army Radio]] that the authorities were not doing enough to crack down on "price tag" vandalism, or what he called "counterterrorism". "If we wanted, we could catch them and when we want to, we will," he added.&lt;ref&gt;Jodi Rudoren, Khaled Abu Aker, [https://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/20/world/europe/west-bank-mosque-is-set-ablaze-and-vandalized.html?src=rechp 'West Bank Mosque Is Set Ablaze and Vandalized,'], at [[New York Times]], 19 June 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

The Opposition leader in the Knesset, [[Shelly Yachimovich]], commented in mid June, after another tire-slashing price tag attack on Palestinian vehicles that
&lt;blockquote&gt;"It is not logical that Israel, which is blessed with intelligence and operational capabilities that are among the best in the world, cannot catch an extremist group that causes indescribable damage."&lt;ref&gt;Noam (Dabul) Dvir, [http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4396165,00.html'Another hate crime in J'lem: Car tires slashed in Arab neighborhood,'] at [[Ynet]],24 June 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; 
In response to such allegations, a [[Shin Bet]] officer has stated that finding culprits for price tag incidents is extremely difficult because the [[hilltop youth]] believed to be behind much of the vandalism are harder to penetrate and recruit as informers than has been the case with [[Hamas]] and [[Islamic Jihad in Palestine|Islamic Jihad]] militants.&lt;ref&gt;Ben Hartman, [http://www.jpost.com/National-News/West-Bank-hilltop-youth-are-the-hardest-informants-to-recruit-Shin-Bet-source-says-351770 'Hilltop youth the hardest informants to recruit'] [[Jerusalem Post]], 9 May 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;
In January 2014, following an incident in which a groups of vandals from an illegal settlement near [[Esh Kodesh]] were captured by Palestinian villagers and handed over to the IDF, Uri Misgav wrote that "the strongest army in the Middle East along with the Shin Bet security service, with all its effectiveness, have not been able to rein in" the settler militia thought responsible for these assaults "over all these long years".&lt;ref name="Misgav" &gt;Uri Misgav, [http://www.haaretz.com/news/national/.premium-1.567901 'The occupation is one big 'price tag’ attack and we're all paying the price,'] at [[Haaretz]] 10 January 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2015 the [[Lod]] District Court convicted a West bank settler, Binyamin Richter, of a racially inspired hate attack, for what it deemed a 'price tag' attack in 2013. Richter was sentenced to 3 years imprisonment, and ordered him to compensate the proprietors of the damaged property to the tune of $3,900.&lt;ref&gt;Stuart Winer, [http://www.timesofisrael.com/mosque-torched-near-bethlehem-in-apparent-hate-crime/'Mosque torched near Bethlehem in apparent hate crime,'] [[The Times of Israel]] 25 February 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2016, Corporal Elad Sela, an Etzion Brigade soldier from the settlement of [[Bat Ayin]], who had been arrested in March 2015, was sentenced to 3 years and 9 months imprisonment for passing on secret information to price tag activists concerning future IDF operations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesofisrael.com/soldier-who-spied-for-jewish-extremists-gets-45-months/ 'Soldier who ‘spied’ for Jewish extremists gets 45 months,'] [[The Times of Israel]] 5 January 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legal redress ==
In 2006 the [[Supreme Court of Israel]] laid down a decision that the State was obliged to "devote manpower for the protection of Palestinian property, must open an immediate inquiry when reports of harassment are received, and send out patrols by security forces to locate such activities."  In one recent case, the Amour family sued for compensation after their olive grove near at-Tuwani, and the settlements of [[Ma'on, Har Hebron|Maon]] and Havat Maon, was subject to a price tag assault. Unknown vandals had cut down 120 trees in 2006; a further tree was felled and the fencing destroyed in 2011; and on 9 May 2013 half of the trees were chopped down and a slogan left reading: "price tag is fed up with thieves – mutual responsibility" and "regards from Eviatar". After initial requests for action from the Civil Administration were ignored, the family filed a claim for damages on the basis of negligence. The state replied to the petition by contending that most of the blame play with the plaintiff, since the Amour family had failed to take appropriate measures to prevent the incident. It further said that the vandals' acts were not sanctioned by the state of Israel. The IDF is investigating the matter.&lt;ref&gt;[[Amira Hass]], [http://www.haaretz.com/news/middle-east/.premium-1.565488 ‘Israel says Palestinian price tag victims to blame for attacks,’] at [[Haaretz]] 36 December 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

The "price tag" policy has also been denounced by the Israeli Prime Minister [[Benjamin Netanyahu]] and many people across the political spectrum in Israel.&lt;ref name=autogenerated10&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inn.co.il/News/News.aspx/216613|title=נתניהו: תג מחיר - עיוות של המחאה האזרחית|publisher=|accessdate=19 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated11&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jpost.com/NationalNews/Article.aspx?id=211353&amp;R=R2|title=Netanyahu condemns settlers’ ‘price tag’ violence|publisher=|accessdate=19 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Former Knesset member and settler leader [[Hanan Porat]] has also condemned the price tag policy. "The 'price tag' response is immoral," Porat said. "It's unheard of that one needs to burn the vineyards and fields of Arabs.

The Chief Ashkenazi Rabbi of Israel, [[Yona Metzger]], visited a mosque in [[Yasuf]] 2009 to express his revulsion at the idea of price tag attacks and to deliver a Koran to the local imam. He was escorted by Israeli security forces and Palestinian police, and although the imam had welcomed him, he and his escorts were pelted by rocks upon leaving the village.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thelede.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/12/14/rabbi-compares-west-bank-mosque-attack-to-kristallnacht/|title=Rabbi Compares West Bank Mosque Attack to Kristallnacht|first=Robert|last=Mackey|publisher=|accessdate=19 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The burning of a mosque at the Bedouin town [[Tuba-Zangariyye]] on 3 October 2011 shocked Israelis, as many Bedouins, including those from this village, serve in the Israeli army. The Israeli President [[Shimon Peres]], accompanied by Israel's two chief rabbis, visited the mosque, and after surveying the damage stated he was "full of shame". Peres also stated that the mosque burning is "an un-Jewish act." In denouncing the attack he added: "It is unconscionable that a Jew would harm something that is holy to another religion ... We will not allow extremists and criminals to undercut the need to live together equally in equality and mutual respect."&lt;ref name="Peres"&gt;John Lyons,[http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/world/mosque-burning-on-west-bank-fuels-tensions/story-e6frg6so-1226158423170 'Mosque burning in Israel fuels tensions,'] in [[The Australian]], 5 October 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Joel Greenberg, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle-east/mosque-torched-in-northern-israel/2011/10/03/gIQA9oTwHL_story.html 'Mosque torched in northern Israel,'] in [[The Washington Post]], 3 October 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the visit, the [[Chief Rabbinate of Israel|chief Sephardic rabbi of Israel]], [[Shlomo Amar]], and chief Ashkenazi Rabbi [[Yona Metzger]], jointly condemned the act and conveyed a message of reconciliation to the village residents. Amar said that he saw it as his duty to set a personal example for the respect one must show to places holy to different religions. He stresses that in the absence of proof, the act may have not been committed by Jews, and the attempt to ascribe the act to price tag activists may be in fact a [[blood libel]]. He also added that if the arsonist was in fact Jewish – he was subject to some of the Jewish laws of [[Rodef|Dinei Rodef]].&lt;ref&gt;, in Kobi Nahshoni, [http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4131020,00.html 'Rabbi Amar: Mosque arson may be blood libel,'] in [[Ynet]], 4 October 2011:'the attempt to ascribe the act to "price tag" activists is basically a "blood libel".&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a [[Ynet]]-Gesher survey conducted in March 2011, it was found that 46% of Israelis believe that "price tag" attacks are justified to a certain extent. A breakdown of attitudes among religious nationalist and ultra-orthodox respondents revealed that a large majority are supportive of such price-tag attacks, with 70% of Orthodox and 71% religious nationalists Jews surveyed justifying the policy.&lt;ref name=gesher&gt;Ynet, [http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4048459,00.html Poll: 46% in favor of 'price tag'],' in [[Ynet]] 28 March 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Ori Nir of [[Peace Now]] evaluated the poll as indicating significant support for violent actions among the Israeli public, yet estimated that it is likely that the timing of the poll influenced the respondents' views. Israelis were still under the influence of the [[Fogel family massacre]], when five Jewish family members, including young children, were massacred in their beds on Sabbath.&lt;ref name="green line"/&gt; A later survey, conducted in November 2011 by [[Tel Aviv University]], found that 88% of Jewish Israelis said they were opposed to the "price tag" attacks, with 38% believing the government's response to the attacks to be "too mild" and another 38% finding the response appropriate. The remaining 13% called the state response "too harsh".&lt;ref name=telavivu&gt;Jerusalem Post, [http://www.jpost.com/NationalNews/Article.aspx?id=245138 ‘88% of Jewish Israelis oppose price tag attacks’],' in [[Jerusalem Post]] 10 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, Israeli settlers have claimed that Palestinians and left-wing activists staged "price tag" attacks as a means of provocation, in an attempt to tarnish the image of Jewish settlers in the West Bank.&lt;ref name="ynet.co.il"&gt;Ali Waked &amp; Efrat Weiss, [http://www.ynet.co.il/articles/0,7340,L-3818479,00.html After fire in the mosque, a Border Policeman and Palestinian injured] (Hebrew) in [[Ynet]], 11 December 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated5&gt;Yair Altman, [http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3976976,00.html 'Settlers: Arabs, leftists staged 'price tag' act,'], in [[Ynet]], 30 October 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;Samuel Grossman, [http://www.ynet.co.il/articles/0,7340,L-3865335,00.html התפרעויות בירושלים אחרי טענות ל"תג מחיר"], in [[Ynet]], 20 March 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated4"&gt;{{Cite web | author=Ali Waked | url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3853437,00.html | title=Settlers reject Palestinian accusations of tree sabotage | work=[[Ynet]] | date=23 February 2010 | access-date=18 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2011 analysis [[Zeev Sternhell]] argues that while the vast majority in Israel is disgusted by these attacks, and the right is distancing itself from those torching mosques, there is little evidence that they condemn the daily harassment of Palestinians by settlers. The "price tag hooligans" are, he maintains, 'the vanguard of the entire settlement movement settler' and 'are increasingly reminiscent of phenomena in Europe in the interwar period.'&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | author=Zeev Sternhell | date=14 October 2011 | title=Israeli society is standing by as settlers take the reins - Haaretz - Israel News &amp;#124; Haaretz.com | url=http://www.haaretz.com/israeli-society-is-standing-by-as-settlers-take-the-reins-1.389841 | work=[[Haaretz]] | access-date=18 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Israeli journalist [[Nadav Shragai]], there is no Israeli leader or rabbi who openly supports this policy, yet some of the young activists who carry out these acts are students of the rabbis [[Yitzchak Ginsburgh]], David Dudkavich and [[Yitzhak Shapira]], who head the "Od Yosef Chai" [[Yeshiva]] in the Israeli settlement of [[Yitzhar]].&lt;ref&gt;The Settler's new policy | Haaretz | Oct 3rd 2008&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview on [[Army Radio (Israel)|Galei Tzahal]] in February 2010, Ginsburgh explicitly called to refrain from violence against Palestinians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://glz.co.il/NewsArticle.aspx?NewsId=56040|title=גלי צה"ל|publisher=|accessdate=19 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shapira, while urging a "fierce defense" of outposts, holds the IDF responsible for the atmosphere in which such acts are undertaken, and for implementing a price tag policy against the yeshiva.&lt;ref&gt;Tovah Lazaroff, [http://www.jpost.com/Israel/IDF-to-blame-for-price-tag-atmosphere 'IDF to blame for price-tag atmosphere,'] in [[Jerusalem Post]], 17 May 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Shapira, who has called for retaliatory attacks against Palestinians, was arrested in January 2010 for his alleged involvement in the torching of a Palestinian mosque. He denied any involvement, and was released due to lack of evidence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/8482700.stm "Rabbi arrested, suspected in West Bank mosque arson"], ''BBC News'', 27 January 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jpost.com/Israel/Article.aspx?id=175764|title='IDF to blame for price-tag atmosphere'|publisher=|accessdate=19 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After an arson attack on a West Bank mosque in 2010, six prominent rabbis from the nearby settlement of [[Gush Etzion]] visited the mosque to deliver new copies of the [[Koran]] that had been burned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jpost.com/Israel/Rabbis-deliver-apologies-new-Korans-to-vandalized-mosque|title=Rabbis deliver apologies, new Korans to vandalized mosque|publisher=|accessdate=19 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2011, police announced that they would question prominent rabbis [[Dov Lior]] and [[Ya'akov Yosef]] over whether their endorsements of Yitzhak Shapira and Yosef Elitzur's book, ''Torat Hamelech'' (The King's Torah)  which argues that killing non-Jews is acceptable as part of a religious war, constituted an incitement. Security officials said that the book could be used by settlers to justify price tag retributive attacks on Palestinians.&lt;ref&gt;Sheera Frenkel [http://www.mcclatchydc.com/2011/07/05/v-print/117043/israels-probe-of-radical-jewish.html Israel's probe of radical Jewish text puts rabbis in spot light], [[The McClatchy Company|McClatchy Washington Bureau]], 7 July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ynet news, in 2011, the [[Ministry of Education (Israel)|Israeli Education Ministry]] decided to shut down the Dorshei Yehudcha Yeshiva high school and withhold funds from the Od Yosef Chai yeshiva due to the involvement of students in violence against Palestinians and security forces. The two yeshivas based in Yitzhar were headed by Rabbi Yitzchak Ginzburg. Education Ministry Director-General Dr. Shimshon Shoshani harshly criticized the establishments writing that  "The students are involved in many violent acts against Palestinian residents and security forces, including during yeshiva study hours. Prominent rabbis in the yeshiva support and/or are involved in this violent activity and go as far as to incite the students to this sort of activity."  Knesset Member Michael Ben-Ari (National Union) said that the shut down of the yeshiva constituted "capitulation to leftist terror."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4142719,00.html |title=Government closes down Yitzhar yeshiva - Israel News, Ynetnews |publisher=Ynetnews.com |date=1995-06-20 |accessdate=2014-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rabbi of [[Har Brakha]], [[Eliezer Melamed]], who according to [[Chaim Levinson]] of Haaretz, is considered one of the more extreme settler rabbis, used his weekly column in the newspaper "Basheva" to denounce the price tag policy. He wrote, "We don't aspire to private vengeance, but to state vengeance led by the Israel Defense Forces and all the systems of government".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/news/palestinian-laborer-beaten-in-suspected-price-tag-attack-1.349896 Palestinian laborer beaten in suspected 'price tag' attack]. Haaretz.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to rabbi Barry Leff of the Israeli NGO [[Rabbis for Human Rights]], the price tag policy is forbidden by [[halacha]] (Jewish religious law). Citing Deuteronomy 24:16, he writes that the Torah clearly forbids vicarious punishment, punishing someone other than the offender. Furthermore, according to Leff, when the perpetrators attack a mosque, a house of God, they are also guilty of violating the principle of [[Bal tashkhit]], not to carry out wanton destruction, as well as the sin of [[Chillul Hashem]], the desecration of God's name.&lt;ref&gt;Barry Leff, [http://www.jpost.com/Opinion/Op-EdContributors/Article.aspx?id=238616 Price tag – a violation of Jewish values], Jerusalem Post&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Expand section|date=October 2011}}
A [[Palestinian Authority]] spokesman, [[Ghassan Khatib]], has stated that Israeli settler attacks on Palestinian agricultural land are "not random events", and that they are "condoned and supported by the Israeli government" who provide settlers with "full impunity and army protection while they destroy Palestinian land".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maannews.com/Content.aspx?ID=425767|title=PA: Settler violence|publisher=|accessdate=19 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An Abu Ghosh resident, Jawdat Ibrahim, writing an op-ed for ''[[Ynet]]'' in response to the slashing of the tires of 22 cars in his own town in June 2013, wrote that it was bizarre that the state of Israel managed to catch the enemies of the State in operations abroad, yet could not arrest the "bunch of local punks" who terrorize Arabs with their vandalism. Such acts are, in his view, the "direct result" of racist remarks by Israeli politicians, humiliation of Arabs by the police and officials in government offices, and the general atmosphere these attitudes create. His town's response, he affirmed would be different: "Here in Abu Ghosh, we implement a 'price tag' policy of a different kind: Wherever the hooligans destroy, we will build; whatever filth they leave behind, we will clean up. We will not let them destroy the co-existence we have worked so hard to maintain for so many years."&lt;ref&gt;Jawdat Ibrahim, [http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4395784,00.html Our 'price tag'] at [[Ynet]] 24 June 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014 after the Notre Dame of Jerusalem Center, the local headquarters of the [[Roman Catholic church|Roman Catholic Church]], was defaced with words in Hebrew saying "Death to Arabs and Christians and to everyone who hates Israel," and a senior Catholic official received a letter threatening to kill him and other Catholic clergy in Israel, [[Fouad Twal]], the Vatican's most senior cleric in Israel, said, "The unrestrained acts of vandalism poison the atmosphere, the atmosphere of coexistence and the atmosphere of collaboration, calling the price tag attacks acts of "terror." He said Israeli authorities were making an insufficient effort to bring the perpetrators to justice.

"This wave of extremist actions of terror is surely of grave concern to all reasonable persons," Twal said.  "The government of Israel must be concerned, because it is very bad for the State of Israel's image abroad. It is also a blight on the democracy that Israel ascribes to itself."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2014/may-web-only/price-tag-israeli-extremists-target-christians.html 'Price Tag' Israeli Extremists Target Christians] Christianity Today, 13 May 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

The report covered not only physical harm to Palestinians, but also property damage such as the impact of uprooted olive trees, damaged tractors or murdered sheep.  These incidents include attacks on Palestinians and their property as a means of discouraging the Israeli authorities from dismantling "small satellite settlements built without official authorization, many on {{Sic|hide=y|privately|-}}owned Palestinian land", which the report refers to as "the so-called 'price tag' strategy".

'''Racine County Jane Doe''' (informally known as '''Crystal Rae''')&lt;ref name=narrative/&gt; was a young white woman whose body was discovered in 1999 in the town of [[Raymond, Wisconsin|Raymond]], [[Racine County]], [[Wisconsin]].&lt;ref name=fox/&gt;  The victim was aged 18 to 35 years at the time of her death, which occurred after weeks of neglect and torture.&lt;ref name=doe&gt;{{cite web|url=http://doenetwork.org/cases/199ufwi.html|title=Case File 199UFWI|publisher=[[The Doe Network]]|accessdate=April 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
New developments in the case emerged after her body was [[Exhumation|exhumed]] on October 16, 2013. It is  not known how successfully these leads have been followed.&lt;ref name=wisn&gt;{{cite news|last=Anderson|first=Mike|title=Investigators still believe Racine County Jane Doe case can be solved|url=http://www.wisn.com/news/south-east-wisconsin/racine-kenosha/investigtors-still-believe-racine-county-jane-doe-case-can-be-solved/22494034|accessdate=April 16, 2014|newspaper=WISN|date=October 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==

[[File:Racine Jane Doe2.jpg|thumb|left|Original reconstructions of the victim, made before the 2012 composite was created.]]

The [[malnutrition|malnourish]]ed woman may have been [[intellectual disability|mentally disabled]]. She had a "[[cauliflower ear]]" deformity, which likely resulted from abuse.&lt;ref name=authorities/&gt;&lt;ref name=fox/&gt; It is believed that she was most likely 18 to 30 years old, although she may have been up to 35.&lt;ref name=narrative&gt;{{cite web|title=Crystal Rae - 1999 Unidentified Racine, Wisconsin (92nd Street, Town of Raymond)|url=http://canyouidentifyme.blogspot.com/2007/10/crystal-rae-1999-unidentified-racine.html|accessdate=13 July 2014|date=4 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Unsolved Homicide-Jane Doe, Racine County|url=http://racineuncovered.org/2015/06/racine-county-sheriffs-unsolved-homicide-jane-doe/|accessdate=20 July 2015|work=Racine Uncovered News|date=28 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her teeth were not well cared for. Her front [[incisor]]s protruded from the mouth, and decay was present on many teeth. Some teeth were missing.&lt;ref name=fox/&gt;&lt;ref name=wisn/&gt; Her curly hair was reddish-brown, collar-length, and appeared to have blond [[Hair highlighting|highlights]].&lt;ref name=fox/&gt; Her eyes were either brown, green, or hazel. There were two [[earring]]s in each of her ears.&lt;ref name=narrative/&gt;&lt;ref name=doe/&gt;&lt;ref name=new/&gt;

She had visible bruises and cuts across her body, and a fractured nose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bauter|first1=Alison|title=Who is she?

She wore a man's shirt, gray in color, with a floral design on the front. After contacting the shirt's manufacturer, it was learned that this type of shirt was first sold in 1984.&lt;ref name=wisn/&gt;&lt;ref name=spotlight/&gt;&lt;ref name=abc/&gt; She was also wearing black [[sweatpants]].

==Investigation==

[[File:Racine Jane Doe Reconstruction.jpg|thumb|right|Another rendering of Racine County Jane Doe.]]

Multiple [[forensic facial reconstruction|reconstructions]] were made of the victim's face .&lt;ref name=doe/&gt; In 2012, an additional reconstruction was created by the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bohr|first1=Nick|title=New image released of Jane Doe found in Racine in 1999|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yk0PIbHHEdU|accessdate=30 November 2014|work=WISN 12 News|publisher=ABC|date=12 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another version of the composite exists, which shows a different facial expression.&lt;ref name=wisn/&gt;&lt;ref name=new/&gt;

At one time, she was thought to be [https://www.facebook.com/FindAundriaMBowman/ Aundria Bowman], who was presumed to have run away from her adoptive parents' house in [[Hamilton, Michigan]] on March 11, 1989, but [[DNA profiling]] via her mother Cathy, demonstrated that they were not the same person. [[Missing person]]s such as Aundria, Tina D'Ambrosio, and Karen Wells have been ruled out.&lt;ref name=authorities/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Racine County, Wisconsin Jane Doe 7/21/1999|url=http://www.missinginamerica.us/apps/blog/categories/show/1561472-racine-county-wi-jane-doe|accessdate=April 16, 2014|date=December 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NamUs UP # 4741|url=https://identifyus.org/en/cases/4741|website=NamUs.org|publisher=[[National Missing and Unidentified Persons System]]|accessdate=11 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Case File 184DFMI|url=http://doenetwork.org/cases/184dfmi.html|publisher=The Doe Network|accessdate=4 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some believed that this case could be linked to the murder of Mary Kate Chamizo (née: Sunderlin), a previously unidentified victim who was discovered in [[Lake County, Illinois]]. Sunderlin was also found malnourished, had poor dentition and had been beaten to death. Three were arrested in that case; one was convicted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Tunkieicz|first1=Jenny|title=Investigators find ties between Jane Doe, Illinois case|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1683&amp;dat=20000721&amp;id=HHcfAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=qS8EAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4507,497867|accessdate=16 August 2014|agency=Milwaukee Journal Sentinel|date=21 July 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Identified - Index 5|url=http://doenetwork.org/cases/identified5.html|website=doenetwork.org|publisher=[[The Doe Network]]|accessdate=16 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The remains were [[exhumation|exhumed]] on October 16, 2013, for further study and transported to [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin]], where the body had previously been examined in 1999.&lt;ref name=fox/&gt;&lt;ref name=abc/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Jones|first1=Stephanie|title=Jane Doe's body exhumed for testing; Sheriff 'determined' to ID her|url=http://journaltimes.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/jane-doe-s-body-exhumed-for-testing-sheriff-determined-to/article_946dbbd6-36a5-11e3-a79b-0019bb2963f4.html|accessdate=3 July 2015|work=The Journal Times|date=16 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Authorities hoped that by studying the [[bone]]s, they would be able to tell where the woman had lived prior to her death.&lt;ref name=spotlight/&gt;

It was announced on July 19, 2015, that the examination of the remains had been completed and that they would be reburied on July 21 on the 16th anniversary of their discovery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Jane Doe to be reinterred on July 21st, 2015|url=http://racineuncovered.org/2015/07/jane-doe-to-be-reinterred-on-july-21st-2015/|accessdate=20 July 2015|work=Racine Uncovered News|date=19 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Authorities stated they had indeed uncovered new leads from the exhumation, but they declined to state any details.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bohr|first1=Nick|title=Racine County Jane Doe reburied|url=http://www.wisn.com/news/racine-county-jane-doe-reburied/34282906|accessdate=24 July 2015|work=NowCast|publisher=ABC|date=21 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 20, 2016 it was announced that chemical isotope testing performed by the [[Smithsonian]] on a sample of her hair and bone suggest she may originally have been from or spent several years of her life in [[Alaska]], [[Montana]] or portions of southern [[Canada]]. Authorities did not comment on what testing the results are from, whether recent with hair or history from bone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=New information learned about Racine County Jane Doe's past|url=http://www.wisn.com/article/new-information-learned-about-racine-county-jane-does-past/7007615 |accessdate=28 January 2018|work=ABC 12 WISN|date=4 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the murder remains unsolved, investigators hope that the case will eventually come to a close. A press conference in 2013 is said to have uncovered more clues.&lt;ref name=fox/&gt;&lt;ref name=wisn/&gt;&lt;ref name=named&gt;{{cite news|last=Edwards|first=Anna|title=Could she finally be named?

'''''Rock Against Sexism''''' (RAS) was a political and cultural movement dedicated to challenging [[sexism]] in the [[rock music]] community, [[popular culture|pop culture]] and in the world at large.  It was primarily a part of the [[punk rock]] music and arts scene.

RAS started in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] in 1978, and by the mid-1980s also had a presence in [[North America]].  It was strongly inspired and influenced by [[Rock Against Racism]] and the two movements had many of the same participants.

In the UK, it began amid controversy when a [[Rock Against Racism]] event hired some [[Rastafarian]] [[reggae]] bands that some participants felt were [[misogynistic]]. This resulted in a discussion of [http://www.punk77.co.uk/graphics/guitarwomensexism16.12.78NME.jpg sexism in music and art]. The bands ([[Aswad (band)|Aswad]] and [[Misty in Roots]]) either responded  by saying it was the will of [[God]], or that they didn't know what sexism was. The UK Rock Against Sexism often gained press coverage in the music press, such as the ''[[NME]]''.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

In the US, RAS [[Boston]] sponsored monthly dance parties at a local gay bar, the 1270.  They put out a [[zine]] and promoted art events and gigs by non-sexist bands.  RAS sponsored music workshops on writing, playing and promoting events.

==Legacy==

Rock Against Sexism's musical and political legacy was many more women playing in bands, working as promoters, and an increased awareness of women's and queer perspectives in the punk rock community.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}  Many trace the [[riot grrrl]] movement in the 1990s to RAS roots. It challenged [[heterosexism]], [[homophobia]], [[sexism]] and [[elitism]], while challenging stereotypes of women, and the way they are represented.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

Many later punk bands challenged the machismo of rock'n'roll by diversifying into [[cuddlecore]], as well as the less [[rockist]] side of [[post-punk]] and [[New wave music|new wave]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} It could be argued that RAS may have been the catalyst, as the advent of [[twee pop]] in the mid-1980s lead to rejection of the machismo of [[hardcore punk]] at the time.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

The '''Royal Opera House (ROH)''' is an [[opera house]] and major performing arts venue in [[Covent Garden]], [[central London]]. The large building is often referred to as simply '''"Covent Garden"''', after a previous use of the site of the opera house's original construction in 1732.  It is the home of [[The Royal Opera]], [[The Royal Ballet]], and the Orchestra of the Royal Opera House. Originally called the '''Theatre Royal''', it served primarily as a playhouse for the first hundred years of its history. In 1734, the first ballet was presented. A year later, [[Handel]]'s first season of operas began. Many of his operas and [[oratorio]]s were specifically written for Covent Garden and had their premieres there.

The current building is the third theatre on the site following disastrous fires in 1808 and 1856. The façade, [[foyer]], and [[auditorium]] date from 1858, but almost every other element of the present complex dates from an extensive reconstruction in the 1990s. The main auditorium seats 2,256 people, making it the third largest in London, and consists of four tiers of [[box (theatre)|box]]es and [[balcony|balconies]] and the [[amphitheatre]] gallery. The [[proscenium]] is 12.20 m wide and 14.80 m high. The main auditorium is a Grade I [[listed building]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theatrestrust.org.uk/resources/theatres/show/443-royal-opera-house-london "Royal Opera House (London)"] description on theatrestrust.org.uk Retrieved 10 May 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Davenant Patent==
[[Image:Rich-Covent-Garden.jpg|thumb|"Rich's Glory": John Rich seemingly invades his new Covent Garden Theatre. (caricature by [[William Hogarth]])]]
The foundation of the '''Theatre Royal, Covent Garden''' lies in the [[letters patent]] awarded by [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] to Sir [[William Davenant]] in 1662, allowing Davenant to operate one of only two [[patent theatre]] companies (''The [[Duke's Company]]'') in London. The letters patent remained in the possession of the patentees' heirs until the 19th century; their whereabouts are currently unknown.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/survey-london/vol35/pp1-8#h3-0004 'The Killigrew and Davenant patents'  ''Survey of London'' vol. 35 pp 1-8.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==The first theatre==
[[Image:Covert Garden Theatre edited.jpg|thumb|upright|Illustration of the first theatre before it burned down in 1808]]
In 1728, [[John Rich (producer)|John Rich]], actor-manager of the Duke's Company at [[Lincoln's Inn Fields]] Theatre, commissioned ''[[The Beggar's Opera]]'' from [[John Gay]]. The success of this venture provided him with the capital to build the Theatre Royal (designed by [[Edward Shepherd]]) at the site of an ancient convent garden, part of which had been developed by [[Inigo Jones]] in the 1630s with a piazza and church.  In addition, a Royal Charter had created a fruit and vegetable market in the area, a market which survived in that location until 1974. At its opening on 7 December 1732, Rich was carried by his actors in processional triumph into the theatre for its opening production of [[William Congreve]]'s ''[[The Way of the World]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Admission to the 55 boxes was 5 shillings (1/4 [[Pound sterling|£]]), half a crown (1/8 £) to the 'pit', and the gallery cost one shilling (1/20 £). A seat on the stage cost ten shillings. It was allowed to send servants to arrive at three to save places on the stage for their masters and mistresses. £115 was taken at the box office on the first night.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the first hundred years or so of its history, the theatre was primarily a playhouse, with the Letters Patent granted by Charles II giving Covent Garden and [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane]] exclusive rights to present spoken drama in London. Despite the frequent interchangeability between the Covent Garden and Drury Lane companies, competition was intense, often presenting the same plays at the same time. Rich introduced [[pantomime]] to the repertoire, himself performing (under the stage name ''John Lun'', as [[Harlequin]]) and a tradition of seasonal pantomime continued at the modern theatre, until 1939.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.peopleplayuk.org.uk/collections/object.php?object_id=285&amp;ter=true&amp;ter_id=83&amp;back=%2Fcollec ''John Rich as Harlequin'']{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} (PeoplePlayUK – Theatre Museum) accessed 22 July 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1734, Covent Garden presented its first ballet, ''Pygmalion''.  [[Marie Sallé]] discarded tradition and her corset and danced in diaphanous robes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/yiannis/dance/history.html ''Early ballet history''] (North Eastern University) accessed 22 December 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; [[George Frideric Handel]] was named musical director of the company, at Lincoln's Inn Fields, in 1719, but his first season of opera, at Covent Garden, was not presented until 1734. His first opera was ''[[Il pastor fido]]'' followed by ''[[Ariodante]]'' (1735), the première of ''[[Alcina]]'', and ''[[Atalanta (opera)|Atalanta]]'' the following year. There was a royal performance of ''[[Messiah (Handel)|Messiah]]'' in 1743, which was a success and began a tradition of [[Lent]]en oratorio performances. From 1735 until his death in 1759 he gave regular seasons there, and many of his operas and oratorios were written for Covent Garden or had their first London performances there. He bequeathed his organ to John Rich, and it was placed in a prominent position on the stage, but was among many valuable items lost in a fire that destroyed the theatre on 20 September 1808. In 1792&lt;ref&gt;Sheppard, p. 91&lt;/ref&gt; the architect [[Henry Holland (architect)|Henry Holland]] rebuilt the auditorium, within the existing shell of the building but deeper and wider than the old auditorium, thus increasing capacity.

==The second theatre==

[[Image:Joseph Grimaldi.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Joseph Grimaldi]], as [[Harlequinade#Clown|Clown]]]]
Rebuilding began in December 1808, and the second Theatre Royal, Covent Garden (designed by [[Robert Smirke (architect)|Robert Smirke]]) opened on 18 September 1809 with a performance of ''[[Macbeth]]'' followed by a musical entertainment called ''The Quaker''. The actor-manager [[John Philip Kemble]], raised seat prices to help recoup the cost of rebuilding and the cost of an increased ground rent introduced by the landowner, the Duke of Bedford, but the move was so unpopular that audiences disrupted performances by beating sticks, hissing, booing and dancing. The ''[[OP Riots|Old Price Riots]]'' lasted over two months, and the management was finally forced to accede to the audience's demands.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.peopleplayuk.org.uk/guided_tours/drama_tour/19th_century/victorian_riots.php ''The Old Price Riots''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080531162120/http://www.peopleplayuk.org.uk/guided_tours/drama_tour/19th_century/victorian_riots.php |date=31 May 2008 }} (PeoplePlayUK – the Theatre Museum (at the [[V &amp; A]]) accessed 1 July 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

During this time, entertainments were varied; opera and ballet were presented, but not exclusively. Kemble engaged a variety of acts, including the child performer ''[[Master Betty]]''; the great [[clown]] [[Joseph Grimaldi]] made his name at Covent Garden. Many famous actors of the day appeared at the theatre, including the tragediennes [[Sarah Siddons]] and [[Eliza O'Neill]], the [[Shakespeare]]an actors [[William Charles Macready]], [[Edmund Kean]] and his son [[Charles Kean|Charles]]. On 25 March 1833 Edmund Kean collapsed on stage while playing [[Othello]], and died two months later.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nndb.com/people/318/000102012/ Edmund Kean (1789–1833)] (NNDB) accessed 22 July 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1806, the [[pantomime]] clown Joseph Grimaldi (''The Garrick of Clowns'') had performed his greatest success in ''[[Mother Goose|Harlequin and Mother Goose; or the Golden Egg]]'' at Covent Garden, and this was subsequently revived, at the new theatre. Grimaldi was an innovator: his performance as ''Joey'' introduced the clown to the world, building on the existing role of [[Harlequin]] derived from the ''[[Commedia dell'arte]]''. His father had been ballet-master at Drury Lane, and his physical comedy, his ability to invent visual [[Magic (illusion)|tricks]] and [[buffoon]]ery, and his ability to poke fun at the audience were extraordinary.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.peopleplayuk.org.uk/guided_tours/pantomime_tour/early_pantomime/grimaldi.php ''Early Pantomime''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080505042950/http://www.peopleplayuk.org.uk/guided_tours/pantomime_tour/early_pantomime/grimaldi.php |date=5 May 2008 }} (PeoplePlayUK – the Theatre Museum (at the [[V &amp; A]]) accessed 22 July 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Early pantomimes were performed as [[mime]]s accompanied by music, but as [[Music hall]] became popular, Grimaldi introduced the [[pantomime dame]] to the theatre and was responsible for the tradition of audience singing. By 1821 dance and clowning had taken such a physical toll on Grimaldi that he could barely walk, and he retired from the theatre.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/MemoirsOfJosephGrimaldi  "Boz" (ed.) ([[Charles Dickens]]), ''Memoirs of Joseph Grimaldi'', 1853 edition with Notes and Additions by [[Charles Whitehead]], accessed 22 February 2007].&lt;/ref&gt; By 1828, he was penniless; Drury Lane held a benefit concert for him after Covent Garden refused.&lt;ref&gt;Arundell, Dennis, ''The Story of Sadler's Wells''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:An Apology To The Town, For Himself And The Bottle.png|thumb|left|upright|''Harlequin's escape into the bottle'' (print)]]
In 1817, bare flame gaslight had replaced the former candles and oil lamps that lighted the Covent Garden stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Theatres Compete in Race to Install Gas Illumination – 1817|url=http://www.overthefootlights.co.uk/1817-18.pdf|work=Over The Footlights|accessdate=20 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was an improvement, but in 1837 Macready employed [[limelight]] in the theatre for the first time, during a performance of a pantomime, ''Peeping Tom of Coventry''. Limelight used a block of [[quicklime]] heated by an oxygen and hydrogen flame. This allowed the use of spotlights to highlight performers on the stage.&lt;ref&gt;Banham, p. 1026&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Theatres Act 1843]] broke the patent theatres' monopoly of drama. At that time [[Her Majesty's Theatre]] in the Haymarket was the main centre of ballet and opera but after a dispute with the management in 1846 [[Michael Costa (conductor)|Michael Costa]], conductor at Her Majesty's, transferred his allegiance to Covent Garden, bringing most of the company with him. The auditorium was completely remodeled after an 1846 fire, during the following 1846–47 seasons, the company performed at the [[Lyceum Theatre, London|Lyceum Theatre]].&lt;ref&gt;"Madame Parepa-Rosa", ''[[Illustrated London News]]'', 7 February 1874, p. 129; and Obituary: "Madame Parepa Rosa", ''The Times'', 23 January 1874, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; The theatre reopened as the '''Royal Italian Opera''' on 6 April 1847 with a performance of [[Gioacchino Rossini|Rossini]]'s ''[[Semiramide]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.roh.org.uk/about/royal-opera-house/history/ History] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407064033/http://www.roh.org.uk/about/royal-opera-house/history |date=7 April 2014 }} (Royal Opera House) accessed 18 December 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1852, [[Louis Antoine Jullien]] the French eccentric composer of light music and conductor presented an opera of his own composition, ''Pietro il Grande''. Five performances were given of the 'spectacular', including live horses on the stage and very loud music. Critics considered it a complete failure and Jullien was ruined and fled to America.&lt;ref&gt;[http://louisjullien.site.voila.fr ''Louis-Antoine Jullien'' (in French)] accessed 21 December 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Jullien, Louis Antoine |volume=15 |page=551}}&lt;/ref&gt; Costa and his successors presented all operas in Italian, even those originally written in French, German or English, until 1892, when [[Gustav Mahler]] presented the debut of Wagner's [[Ring cycle]] at Covent Garden.{{sfn|Parker|1900|p=39}}&lt;ref&gt;[[Anton Seidl]] had conducted the very first Ring in England (sung in German) at [[Her Majesty's Theatre]] from 5–9 May 1882.

==The third theatre==
On 5 March 1856, the theatre was again destroyed by fire. Work on the third theatre, designed by [[Edward Middleton Barry]], started in 1857 and the new building, which still remains as the nucleus of the present theatre, was built by [[Lucas Brothers (company)|Lucas Brothers]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/49439 |title=Charles Thomas Lucas at Oxford Dictionary of National Biography |publisher=Oxforddnb.com |date= |accessdate=4 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and opened on 15 May 1858 with a performance of [[Giacomo Meyerbeer|Meyerbeer's]] ''[[Les Huguenots]]''.

The Royal English Opera company under the management of [[Louisa Pyne]] and [[William Harrison (singer)|William Harrison]], made their last performance at [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane]] on 11 December 1858 and took up residence at the theatre on 20 December 1858 with a performance of [[Michael Balfe]]'s ''Satanella''&lt;ref&gt;''Reviews'', "Drury-Lane Theatre", [[The Times]]'', 13 December 1858, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; and continued at the theatre until 1864.

The theatre became the '''Royal Opera House''' (ROH) in 1892, and the number of French and German works offered increased. Winter and summer seasons of opera and ballet were given, and the building was also used for pantomime, recitals and political meetings.

During the [[First World War]], the theatre was requisitioned by the Ministry of Works for use as a furniture repository.

From 1934 to 1936, [[Geoffrey Toye]] was managing director, working alongside the Artistic Director, [[Thomas Beecham|Sir Thomas Beecham]].  Despite early successes, Toye and Beecham eventually fell out, and Toye resigned.&lt;ref&gt;Jefferson, p. ?&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Second World War]] the ROH became a dance hall. There was a possibility that it would remain so after the war but, following lengthy negotiations, the music publishers [[Boosey &amp; Hawkes]] acquired the lease of the building. [[David Webster (opera manager)|David Webster]] was appointed General Administrator, and [[Sadler's Wells Ballet]] was invited to become the resident ballet company.  The Covent Garden Opera Trust was created and laid out plans "to establish Covent Garden as the national centre of opera and ballet, employing British artists in all departments, wherever that is consistent with the maintenance of the best possible standards&amp;nbsp;..."&lt;ref&gt;Rosenthal, p. ?&lt;/ref&gt;

The Royal Opera House reopened on 20 February 1946 with a performance of ''[[The Sleeping Beauty (ballet)|The Sleeping Beauty]]'' in an extravagant new production designed by [[Oliver Messel]]. Webster, with his music director [[Karl Rankl]], immediately began to build a resident company. In December 1946, they shared their first production, [[Henry Purcell|Purcell]]'s ''[[The Fairy-Queen]]'', with the ballet company. On 14 January 1947, the Covent Garden Opera Company gave its first performance of [[Bizet]]'s ''[[Carmen]]''.

Before the grand opening, the Royal Opera House presented one of the Robert Mayer Children's concerts on Saturday, 9 February 1946.

==Reconstruction from the 1980s forward==
[[File:Royal Opera House at night.jpg|thumb|left|The Royal Opera House, Bow Street Façade, after reconstruction]]

Several renovations had taken place to parts of the house in the 1960s, including improvements to the amphitheatre but the theatre clearly needed a major overhaul. In 1975 the Labour government gave land adjacent to the Royal Opera House for a long-overdue modernisation, refurbishment, and extension. In the early 1980s the first part of a major renovation included an extension to the rear of the theatre on the James Street corner. The development added two new ballet studios, offices, a Chorus Rehearsal Room and the Opera Rehearsal room. Dressing rooms were also added.

This involved the demolition of almost the whole site including several adjacent buildings to make room for a major increase in the size of the complex. The auditorium itself remained, but well over half of the complex is new.

The design team was led by Jeremy Dixon and [[Edward Jones (English architect)|Edward Jones]] of Dixon Jones [[Building Design Partnership|BDP]] as architects. The acoustic designers were Rob Harris and Jeremy Newton of Arup Acoustics. The building engineer was [[Arup Group Limited|Arup]] with Stanhope as developer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stanhopeplc.com/?page=21&amp;id=236  Stanhope company website] on stanhopeplc.com Retrieved 10 May 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

The new building has the same traditional horseshoe-shaped auditorium as before, but with greatly improved technical, rehearsal, office, and educational facilities. Additionally, a new studio theatre, the Linbury, as well as more public space was created. The inclusion of the adjacent old Floral Hall, which had fallen into disrepair and was used as a scenery store before redevelopment, created a new and extensive public gathering place. The venue is now claimed by the ROH to be the most modern theatre facility in Europe.

[[Surtitle]]s, projected onto a screen above the proscenium, have been used for all opera performances since they were introduced for schools matinees in 1984. Since the reopening of the theatre in 1999 an [[Electronic libretto|electronic libretto system]] provides translations onto small video screens for some seats, and additional monitors and screens are to be introduced to other parts of the house.

In 2014 design work, known as the Open Up Project, began with the aim of improving the entrances, lobby areas and the Linbury Theatre.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.architectnews.co.uk/index.php?option=com_k2&amp;view=item&amp;id=396:royal-opera-house-launches-open-up-project-with-architects&amp;Itemid=90 "Royal Opera House launches 'Open Up' project with architects"], on architectnews.co.uk&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Hopkirk, [http://www.building.co.uk/stanton-williams-unveils-%C2%A337m-royal-opera-house-revamp/5071884.article "Stanton Williams unveils £37m Royal Opera House revamp"], 3 November 2014, on architectnews.co.uk.

==Facilities==
===Paul Hamlyn Hall===
[[File:Royal Opera House - Floral Hall - Bow Street - London - 240404.jpg|thumb|Exterior of the Paul Hamlyn Hall]]

The Paul Hamlyn Hall is a large iron and glass structure adjacent to, and with direct access to, the main opera house building. The hall now acts as the atrium and main public area of the opera house, with a champagne bar, restaurant and other hospitality services, and also providing access to the main auditorium at all levels.

The redevelopment of the Floral Hall went ahead on the strength of a pledge of £10m from the philanthropist [[Alberto Vilar]] and for a number of years, it was known as the Vilar Floral Hall; however Vilar failed to make good his pledge. As a result, the name was changed in September 2005 to the Paul Hamlyn Hall, after the opera house received a donation of £10m from the estate of [[Paul Hamlyn]], towards its education and development programmes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/6638245.stm "£10m pledged to Royal Opera House", 9 May 2007 on news.bbc.co.uk] Retrieved 24 March 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

As well as acting as a main public area for performances in the main auditorium, the Paul Hamlyn Hall is also used for hosting a number of events, including private functions, dances, exhibitions, concerts, and workshops.

===Linbury Studio Theatre===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Royal Opera House - Linbury Studio Theatre.jpg|thumb|left|Linbury Studio Theatre – View from the stage]] --&gt;

The Linbury Studio Theatre is a flexible, secondary performance space, constructed below ground level within the Royal Opera House. It has retractable raked seating and a floor which can be raised or lowered to form a studio floor, a raised stage, or a stage with orchestra pit. The theatre can accommodate up to 400 patrons and host a variety of different events. It has been used for private functions, traditional theatre shows, and concerts, as well as community and educational events, product launches, dinners and exhibitions, etc., and is one of the most technologically advanced performance venues in London with its own public areas, including a bar and cloakroom.

The Linbury is most notable for hosting performances of experimental and independent dance and music, by independent companies and as part of the ROH2, the contemporary producing arm of the Royal Opera House.  The Linbury Studio Theatre regularly stages performances by the [[Royal Ballet School]] and also hosts the [[Young British Dancer of the Year]] competition.

The venue was constructed as part of the 90s redevelopment of the Royal Opera House.  It is named in recognition of donations made by the Linbury Trust towards the redevelopment.  The Trust is operated by [[Lord Sainsbury of Preston Candover]] and his wife [[Anya Linden]], a former dancer with the Royal Ballet.  The name Linbury is derived from the names Linden and Sainsbury.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.linburytrust.org.uk/ The Linbury Trust on linburytrust.org.uk] Retrieved 24 March 2012&lt;/ref&gt; It was opened in 1999 with a collaboration from three [[Croydon]] secondary schools (including [[Coloma Convent Girls' School]] and [[Edenham High School]]) in an original performance called ''About Face''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UKTW Archive, London Royal Opera House|url=https://www.uktw.co.uk/archive/London/Royal-Opera-House/Dance/About-Face/L022557777/|website=UK Theatre Web|accessdate=14 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Royal Opera House, Manchester===
{{main|The Royal Ballet#Royal Opera House.2C Manchester}}

In 2008 the Royal Opera House and [[Manchester City Council]] began planning stages a new development known as '''Royal Opera House, Manchester'''. The proposal would have seen the [[Palace Theatre, Manchester|Palace Theatre]] in Manchester refurbished, to create a theatre capable of staging productions by both the [[The Royal Ballet|Royal Ballet]] and the Royal Opera. It was intended that the Royal Opera House would take residence of the theatre for an annual 18-week season, staging 16 performances by the Royal Opera, 28 performances by the Royal Ballet and other small-scale productions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Higgins | first = Charlotte | title = Disharmony over Royal Opera's plan to go north | url = https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/oct/28/royal-opera-lowry-manchester | work = [[The Guardian]] | publisher = [[Guardian Media Group]] | date = 28 October 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Staff writer | title = Northern opera proposal evaluated | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/manchester/7702690.stm | work = [[BBC News]] | publisher = [[BBC]] | date = 31 October 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A year later [[The Lowry]] sent an open letter to the then [[Secretary of State for Culture, Olympics, Media and Sport]], [[Ben Bradshaw]], Arts Council England, Manchester City Council and the ROH, calling for the scheme, in its current form, to be scrapped.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Brown | first = Mark | title = Threat to plan for Royal Opera House in the north | url = https://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/jun/25/lowry-manchester-royal-opera-house | work = [[The Guardian]] | publisher = [[Guardian Media Group]] | date = 25 June 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010 it was announced that the project was being shelved as part of larger arts-funding cuts.&lt;ref name="Stage_031110"&gt;{{cite news | last = Staff writer | title = ROH shelves its plans to move north | url = https://www.thestage.co.uk/news/2010/roh-shelves-its-plans-to-move-north/ | work = [[The Stage]] | publisher = The Stage Media Company Ltd | date = 3 November 2010 }} [http://www.theatrestrust.org.uk/news/show/2252-roh-shelves-its-plans-to-move-north Alternative link.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Sharp | first = Rob | title = Royal Opera House shelves move north | url = https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/classical/news/royal-opera-house-shelves-move-north-2118505.html | work = [[The Independent]] | publisher = Independent Print Ltd | date = 27 October 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The building was designed by Nicholas Hare Architects.&lt;ref name="EEDA"&gt;[http://www.eeda.org.uk/5894.asp  "Thurrock launches new creative and cultural hub", 13 December 2010, East of England Development Agency press release on its website eeda.org.uk] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718095403/http://www.eeda.org.uk/5894.asp |date=18 July 2011 }} Retrieved 9 January 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The East of England Development Agency, which partly funded developments on the park, notes that "the first phase includes the Royal Opera House's Bob and Tamar Manoukian Production Workshop and Community areas".&lt;ref name="EEDA"/&gt;

The Bob and Tamar Manoukian Costume Centre, also designed by Nicholas Hare Associates, opened in September 2015, and provides a costume-making facility for the Royal Opera House and a training centre for students of costume-making from [[South Essex College]]. The building also houses the Royal Opera House's collection of historically important costumes. 

Other elements at High House, Purfleet include The Backstage Centre, a new technical theatre and music training centre which is currently run by the National College for Creative Industries and was formally opened by [[Creative &amp; Cultural Skills]] in March 2013, alongside renovated farm buildings. Acme studios opened a complex of 43 artist studios in Summer 2013.&lt;ref&gt;

'''Stampex''' is a twice yearly British [[stamp show]] held at the [[Business Design Centre]] (BDC) at Islington, London, every Spring and Autumn. The show is organised by the [[Philatelic Traders Society]] (PTS) through their company ''PTS Stamp and Coin Exhibitions Limited'' and has been running for many years.  The next exhibition will be held on 12-15 September 2018.

==Elements of the show==
The show consists mainly of stands from stamp dealers who are members of the PTS but specialist [[philatelic]] societies often hold meetings at the BDC in conjunction with the show.

Until recently competitive stamp exhibitions were also held. The Association of British Philatelic Societies (ABPS) has announced that they will be reintroduced with effect from the Autumn 2009 show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ukphilately.org.uk/abps/latestnews/ABPS_Competitions.html |accessdate=June 6, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081203231454/http://www.ukphilately.org.uk/abps/latestnews/ABPS_Competitions.html |archivedate=December 3, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other important parts of the show include a youth area run by the National Youth Stamp Group and a large stand from Britain's [[Royal Mail]] where recent British stamp issues are on sale.

==Souvenirs==
Admission is free of charge and visitors usually receive a modest philatelic souvenir of some kind. At the Spring 2009 show a postcard was given featuring unadopted artwork by stamp designer [[Jeffery Matthews]] for a proposed 1979 Welsh Assembly stamp issue. These souvenirs have become collectable. Each Stampex issues a Smilers Sheet (released in conjunction with Stanley Gibbons, the official sponsors of Stampex, and Royal Mail) available for purchase as well as a free commemorative postcard.

==History==
Stampex has not always been at the BDC. For many years it was located at the Central Hall, Westminster when it was organised between the PTS and The Junior Philatelic Society (now the [[National Philatelic Society]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lookandlearn.com/childrens-newspaper/CN630316-010.pdf |format=PDF |title=The Children's Newspaper |date=16 March 1963 |website=Lookandlearn.vom |accessdate=2016-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other British shows ==
There is no other regular national show competing with Stampex in the UK, although many smaller shows take place and an [[Fédération Internationale de Philatélie|FIP]] endorsed international show takes place in London every ten years, with the next being the London 2020 International Stamp Exhibition.

The name has been adopted for stamp shows in other countries, for instance Hong Kong Stampex and Adelaide Stampex, however, none are connected with the British version.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2231">The '''Tentacles Convention''' was an international [[role-playing game]] [[Gaming convention|convention]] held annually at [[Stahleck Castle]] in Germany on [[Pentecost]]. Tentacles was dedicated to games set in [[Glorantha]] such as ''[[HeroQuest (role-playing game)|HeroQuest]]'' and ''[[RuneQuest]]'', as well as ''[[Call of Cthulhu (role-playing game)|Call of Cthulhu]]'', ''[[Stormbringer (role-playing game)|Stormbringer]]'' and ''[[Hawkmoon (role-playing game)|Hawkmoon]]''.

Tentacles Convention was hosted by the ''RuneQuest Gesellschaft e.V.'' (better known outside of Germany as ''The Chaos Society'') every year from 1996 to 2009. During that time, Tentacles, and [[Convulsiion]] followed by [[Continuum Conventions|Continuum]] were the only periodically held [[Glorantha]] conventions in Europe. Most of the about 180 guests were fans and authors of the supported game systems. The publishers [[Chaosium]], [[Issaries, Inc.]] and MoonDesign used Tentacles as a forum for presenting and discussing the plans of their games.

Due to the international audience English was the main language. Tentacles offered the only opportunity in Germany to get in touch with two founders of role-playing [[Greg Stafford]] and [[Sandy Petersen]]. Sandy Petersen and other invited authors regularly wrote game modules and articles especially for Tentacles Convention. These works were published in the ''Ye Booke of Tentacles (YboT)''-almanacs which are treasured by Glorantha and English-speaking Cthulhu fans.

A notable type of games on Tentacles was the [[freeform role-playing game]].

'''Fukushima Dai-ichi''' (''dai-ichi'' means "#1"), is a multi-[[Nuclear reactor technology|reactor]] [[Nuclear power plant|nuclear power site]] in the [[Fukushima Prefecture]] of Japan. The [[Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster]] occurred after a [[Moment magnitude scale|9.0 magnitude]] [[2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami|Tōhoku earthquake and subsequent tsunami]] on 11 March 2011, only 14 days before the reactor was to be shut down. This offshore earthquake, near the island of [[Honshu Island|Honshu]],&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web |url=https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/eqinthenews/2011/usc0001xgp/ |title=Magnitude 9.0 – near the East coast of Honshu, Japan |publisher=Earthquake.usgs.gov |accessdate=17 March 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5x7WfsrXn?url=http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/eqinthenews/2011/usc0001xgp/ |archivedate=12 March 2011 |df=dmy-all }}
&lt;/ref&gt; produced a large [[tsunami]] in Japan, and a [[Tsunami warning system|tsunami warning]] for over 20 countries within and around the [[Pacific Rim]].

The earthquake triggered a [[scram]] shut down of the three active reactors at the [[Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant|Fukushima I Nuclear Power Plant]] (Fukushima Dai-Ichi). The ensuing tsunami crippled the site, stopped the Fukushima I backup [[diesel generator]]s, and caused a station [[power outage|blackout]]. The subsequent [[Loss-of-coolant accident|lack of cooling]] led to explosions and [[nuclear meltdown|meltdowns]] at the Fukushima I facility, with problems at three of the six reactors and in one of the six [[Spent nuclear fuel|spent-fuel pool]]s.

Times are given in [[Japan Standard Time]] (JST), unless noted, which is [[UTC+09:00|UTC plus nine hours]].

==March 2011==

===Monday, 7 March===
[[Tokyo Electric Power Company]] (TEPCO) submits a report to Japan's nuclear safety agency which predicts the possibility of a tsunami up to 10.2 metres high at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant in the event of an earthquake similar to the [[1896 Sanriku earthquake|magnitude 7.2 earthquake with accompanying tsunami]] that devastated the area in 1896.  TEPCO actually made this prediction in 2008 but delayed in submitting the report because they ''"did not feel the need to take prompt action on the estimates"''.&lt;ref name="JAIF_Report_224"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jaif.or.jp/english/news_images/pdf/ENGNEWS01_1317702304P.pdf|title=Earthquake report No. 224|publisher=JAIF|date=4 October 2011|accessdate=4 October 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111028152753/http://www.jaif.or.jp/english/news_images/pdf/ENGNEWS01_1317702304P.pdf|archivedate=28 October 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{wikinews|8.9 magnitude earthquake hits Japan, causes tsunami}}
* 14:46: A [[2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami|9.1 magnitude earthquake]] strikes off the coast of [[Honshu Island]] at a depth of about {{convert|24|km|mi}}. The [[Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant|Fukushima I]] power plant's nuclear reactors 1, 2, and 3 are automatically shut down by the tremor. Nuclear reactors 4, 5, and 6 were undergoing routine maintenance and were not operating (reactor 4 was defueled in November 2010). The tremor has the additional effect of causing the power plant to be cut off from the Japanese electricity grid; however, backup diesel generators kick in to continue cooling.

To release pressure within reactor unit 1 at Fukushima I, steam is released out of the unit into the air. This steam contains water vapor, hydrogen, oxygen and some radioactive material.

TEPCO engineers decided to directly inject seawater inside the pressure vessel of the reactors by means of the mobile trucks of the firemen. The pressure relief was also necessary to allow the firemen to inject seawater into the reactors vessels.

The Japanese Nuclear Safety Commission states that it "assumed" melted fuel rods in unit 2 have released radioactive substances into the coolant water, which subsequently leaked out through an unknown route to the unit 2 turbine building basement. To reduce the amount of leaking water, TEPCO reduced the amount of water pumped into the unit 2 reactor, from 16 tons per hour to 7 tons per hour, which could lead to higher reactor temperatures. The highly radioactive water halts work on restoring the cooling pumps and other powered systems to reactors 1–4.&lt;ref&gt;Nagata, Kazuaki, and Kanako Takahara, "[http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20110329a1.html Radioactive water keeps workers out]", ''[[Japan Times]]'', 29 March 2011, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; TEPCO confirms finding low levels of [[plutonium]] in five samples during 21 and 22 March.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=the CNN Wire Staff|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2011/WORLD/asiapcf/03/28/japan.nuclear.plutonium/?hpt=T2|title=TEPCO says plutonium found on quake-damaged plant grounds|publisher=CNN|accessdate=7 April 2011|date=28 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Enriched levels of [[Plutonium-238]], relative to [[Plutonium-239]] and [[Plutonium-240]], at two of the sites in the plant (solid waste area and field) indicate that contamination has occurred at those sites due to the "recent incident".

This more highly radioactive water is preventing workers from making progress on restoring the cooling and other systems to reactors 1–4.&lt;ref&gt;Takahara, Kanako, "[http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20110405a1.html Tepco dumps toxic water into sea]", ''[[Japan Times]]'', 5 April 2011, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[NHK]]'', "Discharge of radioactive water into sea continues", 5 April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Samples of seawater near the plant reveal radioactive [[caesium]] at 1.1&amp;nbsp;million times the legal limit.&lt;ref name="latimes2"&gt;Hall, Kenji and Makinen, Julie, "[http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/la-fg-japan-nuclear-20110406,0,2697428.story]", "[[Los Angeles Times]]", 5 April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The company says it could release up to 11,500 tons of radioactive water into the sea. A spokeswoman for Japan’s Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency says the less-contaminated water must be disposed of so that workers can secure a place to store more highly contaminated water on the site.&lt;ref name="washingtonpost1"/&gt;

Engineers consider plans to inject inert [[nitrogen]] gas into the containment buildings of units 1, 2 and 3 to expel atmospheric [[oxygen]] and to dilute accumulated [[hydrogen]], which combine explosively.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/la-fg-japan-reactor-damage-20110403,0,1606193.story Japanese nuclear plant continues its radioactive spill into ocean], ''Los Angeles Times''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tuesday, 5 April===
It is determined that the leak into the cable storage pit from unit 2 was likely due to a faulty joint where the pit meets a duct. The pit leads to a gravel layer beneath, resulting in highly radioactive water pouring directly into the sea.&lt;ref name=iaea1960&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iaea.org/press/?p=1960 |title=IAEA Update on Fukushima Nuclear Accident (6 April 2011, 8:15 UTC) : IAEA Alert Log: Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Accident |publisher=Iaea.org |accessdate=24 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lot"&gt;[http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/la-fg-japan-nuclear-20110406,0,2697428.story Japan nuclear plant operator reports some success on leak], ''Los Angeles Times''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite protests from the South Korean government, Russian scientists, and Japanese fishermen, Japan authorizes the release of {{convert|11500|tonne}} of less radioactive water into the ocean to make room to store the more highly contaminated water.&lt;ref name="lot"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20110406x6.html |title=Japan defends radical decision to dump toxic water in Pacific |work=The Japan Times   |date=6 April 2011 |accessdate=24 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the workers at the nuclear plant were evacuated.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

Official measures at Fukushima I reactor unit 1, however, show a rise in temperature following the aftershock and a spiking amount of radiation in the Dry Well, which exceeds the instrument maximum of 100 Sv/h.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://atmc.jp/plant/rad/?n=1 |title=Unit 1 nuclear power plant Fukushima Radiation |publisher=TEPCO |accessdate=8 April 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110408070037/http://atmc.jp/plant/rad/?n=1 |archivedate=8 April 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Gauge B, in the meantime, records a steady increase in pressure for the previous ten days in the same reactor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://atmc.jp/plant/vessel/?n=1 |title=Unit 1 nuclear power plant Fukushima Pressure |publisher=TEPCO |accessdate=8 April 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110410002940/http://atmc.jp/plant/vessel/?n=1 |archivedate=10 April 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Reporting the rise to 100 Sv/h from the earlier 30 Sv/h, TEPCO declares that the "validity of the measurement is questioned" both for radiation levels and pressure.

Japan still struggles to keep water on the reactors to cool them and prevent further meltdown. Russian [[Antonov An-124]] cargo planes fly out of Atlanta and Los Angeles, each carrying a huge concrete boom pump. The two 95-ton boom pumps, which TEPCO purchased for $2million each, can be operated from two miles away by remote control. Each boom pump can direct focused streams of water into the damaged reactors.&lt;ref name="Longbottom"&gt;Longbottom, Wil.

Prior to the elevation to level 7 by the Japanese authorities [[James M. Acton|James Acton]], Associate of the Nuclear Policy Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, was of the opinion that "Fukushima is not the worst nuclear accident ever but it is the most complicated and the most dramatic, {{sic|This}} was a crisis that played out in real time on TV. Chernobyl did not."&lt;ref&gt;[https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20110414005117/http://in.ibtimes.com/articles/132391/20110409/japan-nuclear-crisis-radiation.htm "Analysis: A month on, Japan nuclear crisis still scarring,"] ''International Business Times'' (Australia). 9 April 2011.

A survey of radiation in seawater outside unit 2 shows radioactive isotope concentrations ([[iodine-131]], [[caesium-134]] and [[caesium-137]]) falling for the third consecutive day since the leak was plugged. However, the levels are still high at several thousand times legal levels. Other nuclides are being investigated, but Japanese regulator NISA has flagged up problems with TEPCO's sampling methodology.&lt;ref name="neimagazine1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.neimagazine.com/story.asp?sectionCode=72&amp;storyCode=2059373 |title=Nuclear Engineering International |publisher=Neimagazine.com |date=12 April 2011 |accessdate=24 April 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120319191628/http://www.neimagazine.com/story.asp?sectionCode=72&amp;storyCode=2059373 |archivedate=19 March 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Coolant injection into reactors 1 and 3 is interrupted for 50 minutes due to a loss of power after a strong earthquake.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://english.kyodonews.jp/news/2011/04/84640.html |title=Restoration work at Fukushima plant suffers setback in Monday quake |agency=Kyodo News   |accessdate=11 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Workers plan to pump water into turbine condensers, but need to pump water out of them first. Work to transfer water from the unit 2 and unit 1 condensers to a central storage tank was completed on 9 and 10 April. Workers have also knocked holes through the turbine hall buildings of units 2 and 4 to accommodate hoses for the water transfer. At unit 3, work continues to make space for water in the turbine condenser by pumping existing water into other tanks. Japanese news wire NHK reports that workers are laying hoses to transfer water to an LLW waste processing facility, which continues to be inspected. TEPCO says that it cannot start work switching on emergency systems on site until the turbine hall is dry. NHK also reported that radioactive water filling a tunnel near unit 2 has risen 12&amp;nbsp;cm since a leak in a trench was stopped on Wednesday 6 April.&lt;ref name="neimagazine1"/&gt;

Following the hydrogen explosion in the reactor 1 building on 12 March and releases from the reactor 3 building, the equivalent of 190,000 terabecquerels of radioactive iodine had been released from the reactor buildings by 15 March, according to calculations by the Nuclear Safety Commission of Japan. A terabecquerel is equivalent to 1&amp;nbsp;trillion becquerels. The high level meant that by 15 March the Fukushima plant accident had already reached the worst level 7 on the International Nuclear and Radiological Event Scale, matching the assessment given to the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear disaster.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=High radiation levels detected at Fukushima grounds a month after explosions|date=26 April 2011|url=http://www.asahi.com/english/TKY201104250130.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since that time the Fukushima reactors have continued to emit radiation; including atmospheric, water, and gamma ray releases.

At Chernobyl, approximately 10 times the amount of radiation was released into the atmosphere as was released from Fukushima I through 12 April 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Tran, Mark|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/apr/12/japan-fukushima-chernobyl-crisis-comparison|title=Nuclear crises: How do Fukushima and Chernobyl compare?|work=The Guardian |location=UK |date=12 April 2011|accessdate=13 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The total amount of radioactive material still stored at Fukushima is about 8 times that stored at Chernobyl, and leakage at Fukushima continues.

Nuclear fuel is reported to have melted and fallen to the lower containment sections of reactors 1, 2 and 3. The melted material is not expected to breach a container (which might cause a massive radiation release). Instead, the melted fuel is thought to have dispersed fairly uniformly across the lower portions of the containers of the three reactors, which would make the resumption of the fission process, to the extent of a [[criticality accident|recriticality]] accident, 'most unlikely';&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalsecuritynewswire.org/gsn/nw_20110415_5020.php |title= Japan plant fuel melted partway through reactors: Report |publisher=Globalsecuritynewswire.org |date=15 April 2011 |accessdate=24 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, it is only during future dismantling of the three damaged reactors that it would be possible to verify this hypothesis and to know what really occurred inside the reactor cores.

The Associated Press reports that two [[PackBot]] ground robots from [[iRobot]] have entered unit 1 and unit 3 of the crippled Fukushima nuclear power plant and performed temperature, pressure, and radioactivity measurements. The remote-controlled robots entered the two reactors over the preceding weekend. The devices opened closed doors and explored the insides of the reactor buildings, coming back with radioactivity readings of up to 49&amp;nbsp;mSv/h inside unit 1 and up to 57&amp;nbsp;mSv/h inside unit 3. TEPCO officials say that the radiation data from the robots do not change their plans for shutting down the plant by the end of this year. Though more robots will be used, a TEPCO official, Takeshi Makigami, says that robots are limited in what they can do, and eventually "people must enter the buildings".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://spectrum.ieee.org/automaton/robotics/industrial-robots/robots-enter-fukushima-reactors-detect-high-radiation |title=Robots enter Fukushima reactors, detect high radiation – IEEE Spectrum |publisher=Spectrum.ieee.org |accessdate=24 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Robots also entered unit 2, but the probe was hindered by fogging of the robot's camera lens from the high humidity, over 90%, inside the building.&lt;ref name="jaif.or.jp-1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jaif.or.jp/english/news_images/pdf/ENGNEWS01_1305711249P.pdf |title=Earthquake Report No. 85 |publisher=JAIF |date=18 May 2011 |accessdate=18 May 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111011180610/http://www.jaif.or.jp/english/news_images/pdf/ENGNEWS01_1305711249P.pdf |archivedate=11 October 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Workers enter the reactor 1 building. This is the first time since the start of the crisis that a reactor building in the plant is visited by a human being. The workers will connect a ventilation system that should absorb radiation inside the building for the next 4–5 days, allowing them to start installation of the cooling system replacement. Because of protective gear, the workers are only exposed to a small amount of radiation (about 2 mSv).&lt;ref&gt;Tomoka A Hosaka (2011)[http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,2069695,00.html Workers Enter Fukushima Reactor Building].

It is reported that 22 out of 23 radiation monitoring systems around the Fukushima plants were disabled by the earthquake and tsunami. Some were directly damaged, but most were disabled due to communication and power lines being cut. Even monitors equipped with backup satellite links failed, probably due to antenna damage. In [[Miyagi prefecture]], 4 out of 7 were disabled by the tsunami, with the remaining three stopping after three hours. In [[Ibaraki Prefecture|Ibaraki]], some 40 monitors stopped working for three hours until power could be restored.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kyodo|title=Power outages, downed communication lines knocked out most radiation monitoring systems in disaster areas|url=http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20110529a4.html|accessdate=29 May 2011|newspaper=The Japan Times |date=29 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

TEPCO begins a trial run of a radioactive water treatment system in an effort to break away from the vicious cycle of injecting water into reactors to cool them and ending up with more contaminated water.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mdn.mainichi.jp/mdnnews/news/20110616p2a00m0na015000c.html TEPCO starts up water treatment system, but massive radioactive waste feared] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110619001951/http://mdn.mainichi.jp/mdnnews/news/20110616p2a00m0na015000c.html |date=19 June 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While contaminated water is treated, the system is expected to produce about 2,000 cubic meters of radioactive sludge by the end of 2011.

The radioactive water treatment system is forced to shut down because a filter exceeds its radioactivity limit. The separation unit, which removes caesium from the water, had been expected to last about a month before its cartridge required replacing—at a radiation level of 4 millisieverts per hour. The radiation levels near the filter cartridge replacement valves reach 4.7 millisieverts per hour after just 5 hours of operation, reportedly due to oil and sludge in the water which contained more radioactivity than expected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nuclearstreet.com/nuclear_power_industry_news/b/nuclear_power_news/archive/2011/06/20/after-five-hours_2c00_-accumulated-radiation-forces-tepco-to-stop-water-treatment-062002.aspx |title=After five hours, accumulated radiation forces TEPCO to stop water treatment| publisher=Nuclear Street |date=20 June 2011| accessdate=23 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20110620n1.html |title=TEPCO plays down decontamination failure|work=The Japan Times |date=20 June 2011 |accessdate=20 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nuclear Regulatory Commission|US Nuclear Regulatory Commission]] Chairman [[Gregory Jaczko]], visiting Japan, confirmed that the Daiichi reactors were stable.  Said Jaczko, "The temperatures have decreased significantly, the amount of heat that's being produced from the reactor fuel itself is very, very low now.  So it simply doesn't have the kind of energy, if you will, that's needed to have any kind of off-site releases of radiation.

An interim report was issued by the investigative panel headed by Yotaro Hatamura.  In the report, the panel concluded that poor internal communication by the Japanese government and faulty knowledge and actions by TEPCO employees contributed to the disaster.  The Japanese cabinet was not informed of the government's System for Prediction of Environmental Emergency Dose Information, which could have told them of the wind direction's effect on the spread of radiation, which would have allowed them to make better decisions on which areas to evacuate around Fukushima Daiichi.  TEPCO workers mistakenly believed that the isolation condenser for reactor No. 1 was still working, when it was not, delaying efforts to try other methods to cool the reactor.  TEPCO workers turned off an emergency cooling system on reactor No. 3 for seven hours to try to switch to another system that was not working, allowing the reactor to overheat more quickly.&lt;ref&gt;Nagata, Kazuaki, "[http://www.japantimes.co.jp/text/nn20111226x1.html Report blasts government's crisis response]", ''[[Japan Times]]'', 27 December 2011, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nuclear scientists in Japan are planning a [[controlled nuclear meltdown]] in the hope of learning how to prevent disasters like the one at Fukushima. Using a scaled down version of a nuclear reactor, [[Tomoyuki Sugiyama]], a senior scientist at the [[Japan Atomic Energy Agency]], told [[MSN Sankei]] that scientists "want to help improve the accuracy of the Fukushima accident analysis" using the data from their experiment. "We want to study exactly how [[Nuclear meltdown|meltdown]]s happen and apply what we will learn to help improve ways to deal with severe accidents in the future," another spokesman for the government-backed engineering agency told [[Agence France Presse]]. The experiment will test a small [[fuel rod]] in a very rapid [[Nuclear fission|fission]] process. The project will begin sometime later this year, the spokesman said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://worldnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2014/01/09/22239864-japan-plans-nuclear-reactor-meltdown-to-help-prevent-another-fukushima-disaster?lite&amp;ocid=msnhp&amp;pos=1|title=Japan plans nuclear reactor meltdown to help prevent another Fukushima disaster|author=World News|date=18 February 2015|work=NBC News|accessdate=18 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

TEPCO said the radiation level in the containment vessel of reactor 2 at the crippled Fukushima No. 1 power plant was 530 sieverts per hour, the highest recorded level since the triple core meltdown in March 2011. This is however the first measurement of the radiation level within the reactor area and as such is likely lower than in the initial period after the meltdown. TEPCO also announced that there is a 2-meter hole under the pressure vessel in the reactor’s primary containment vessel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2017/02/03/national/tepco-finds-gaping-hole-grate-containment-vessel-potential-fuel-debris-fukushima-no-1-power-plant/|title=Highest radiation reading since 3/11 detected at Fukushima No. 1 reactor|publisher=

A recent investigation by TEPCO using temperature measurements has determined the probable location of the cores for reactors 1–3.  They believe that most of the core debris has breached the pressure vessel and lays at the bottom of the containment vessel for reactors 1 and 3, although some debris seems to be lodged in the control rod drive mechanism for reactor 1.  However, they believe that most debris may remain at the bottom of the pressure vessel for reactor 2.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jaif.or.jp/en/new-data-obtained-on-debris-locations-based-on-temperature-changes-using-reduced-injections-of-water/|title=New Data Obtained on Debris Locations Based on Temperature Changes Using Reduced Injections of Water|publisher=

The '''''Trent'' Affair''' was a [[International incident|diplomatic incident]] in 1861 during the [[American Civil War]] that threatened a war between the United States and the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]]. The [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] illegally captured two Confederate diplomats from a British ship; the UK protested vigorously. The United States ended the incident by releasing the diplomats.

On November 8, 1861, the {{USS|San Jacinto|1850|6}}, commanded by [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] Captain [[Charles Wilkes]], intercepted the British [[packet ship|mail packet]] [[RMS Trent|RMS ''Trent'']] and removed, as [[contraband]] of war, two Confederate diplomats: [[James Murray Mason]] and [[John Slidell]]. The envoys were bound for Britain and France to press the Confederacy's case for [[diplomatic recognition]] and to lobby for possible financial and military support.

Public reaction in the United States was to celebrate the capture and rally against Britain, threatening war.  In the [[Confederate States of America|Confederate States]], the hope was that the incident would lead to a permanent rupture in [[United Kingdom – United States relations|Anglo-American relations]] and possibly even war or at least diplomatic recognition by Britain.  Confederates realized their independence potentially depended on intervention by Britain and France.  In Britain, the public disapproved of this violation of [[Country neutrality (international relations)|neutral]] rights and insult to their national honor. The British government demanded an apology and the release of the prisoners and took steps to strengthen its military forces in [[British North America|Canada]] and the Atlantic.

President [[Abraham Lincoln]] and his top advisors did not want to risk war with Britain over this issue. After several tense weeks, the crisis was resolved when the Lincoln administration released the envoys and disavowed Captain Wilkes's actions, though without a formal apology. Mason and Slidell resumed their voyage to Britain but failed in their goal of achieving diplomatic recognition.

==Background==
Relations with the United States were often strained and even verged on war when Britain almost supported the Confederacy in the early part of the  [[American Civil War]]. British leaders were constantly annoyed from the 1840s to the 1860s by what they saw as Washington's pandering to the democratic mob, as in the [[Oregon boundary dispute]] in 1844 to 1846. However, British middle-class public opinion sensed a common "[[Special Relationship]]" between the two peoples, based on language, migration, evangelical Protestantism, liberal traditions, and extensive trade.

During the affair, London drew the line and Washington retreated.&lt;ref&gt;George L. Bernstein, "Special Relationship and Appeasement: Liberal policy towards America in the age of Palmerston." ''Historical Journal'' 41 #3 (1998): 725–750.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Confederacy and its president, [[Jefferson Davis]], believed from the beginning that European dependence on Southern cotton for its textile industry would lead to diplomatic recognition and intervention, in the form of mediation. Historian Charles Hubbard wrote:

{{quote|Davis left foreign policy to others in government and, rather than developing an aggressive diplomatic effort, tended to expect events to accomplish diplomatic objectives. The new president was committed to the notion that cotton would secure recognition and legitimacy from the powers of Europe. One of the Confederacy's strongest hopes at the time was the belief that the British, fearing a devastating impact on their textile mills, would recognize the Confederate States and break the Union blockade. The men Davis selected as secretary of state and emissaries to Europe were chosen for political and personal reasons—not for their diplomatic potential. This was due, in part, to the belief that cotton could accomplish the Confederate objectives with little help from Confederate diplomats.&lt;ref&gt;Hubbard p. 7. Hubbard further writes that Davis' policy was "a rigid and inflexible policy based on economic coercion and force. The stubborn reliance of the Confederates on a King Cotton strategy resulted in a natural resistance to coercion from the Europeans. Davis's policy was to hold back cotton until the Europeans "came to get it".  The opinions of Secretary of War Judah Benjamin and Secretary of the Treasury Christopher Memminger that cotton should be immediately exported in order to build up foreign credits was overridden by Davis.|Hubbard pp. 21–25&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Image:William Seward, Secretary of State, bw photo portrait circa 1860-1865.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[William H. Seward]] (1801–1872) (c. 1860–1865)]]
[[Image:palmerston.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Henry John Temple, 3rd Viscount Palmerston]] (1784–1865)]]

The Union's main focus in foreign affairs was just the opposite: to prevent any British recognition of the Confederacy. Notwithstanding a [[Pig War (1859)|relatively minor border incident in the Pacific Northwest]], Anglo-American relations had steadily improved throughout the 1850s. The issues of the [[Oregon boundary dispute|Oregon territory]], British involvement in [[Texas]], and the Canada–US border dispute had all been resolved in the 1840s. [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[William H. Seward]], the primary architect of American foreign policy during the war, intended to maintain the policy principles that had served the country well since the American Revolution: non-intervention by the United States in the affairs of other countries and resistance to foreign intervention in the affairs of the United States and other countries in the [[Western Hemisphere]].&lt;ref&gt;Jones pp. 2–3. Hubbard p. 17. Mahin p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;

British Prime Minister [[Henry John Temple, 3rd Viscount Palmerston|Lord Palmerston]] urged a policy of neutrality. His international concerns were centered in Europe, where both [[Napoleon III of France|Napoleon III]]'s ambitions in Europe and [[Otto von Bismarck|Bismarck]]'s rise in [[Prussia]] were occurring. During the Civil War, British reactions to American events were shaped by past British policies and their own national interests, both strategically and economically. In the Western Hemisphere, as relations with the United States improved, Britain had become cautious about confronting the United States over issues in [[Central America]].

As a naval power, Britain had a long record of insisting that neutral nations honor its blockades of hostile countries. From the earliest days of the war, that perspective would guide the British away from taking any action that might have been viewed in Washington as a direct challenge to the Union blockade. From the perspective of the South, British policy amounted to ''de facto'' support for the Union blockade and caused great frustration.&lt;ref&gt;Berwanger p. 874.  Hubbard p. 18. Baxter, ''The British Government and Neutral Rights'', p. 9.  Baxter wrote that "the British government, while defending the rights of British merchants and shipowners, kept one eye on the precedents and the other on the future interests of the mistress of the sea."&lt;/ref&gt;

The Russian Minister in Washington, [[Eduard de Stoeckl]], noted, "The Cabinet of London is watching attentively the internal dissensions of the Union and awaits the result with an impatience which it has difficulty in disguising." De Stoeckl advised his government that Britain would recognize the Confederate States at its earliest opportunity. [[Cassius Clay (1810–1903)|Cassius Clay]], the US minister in Russia, stated, "I saw at a glance where the feeling of England was. They hoped for our ruin! They are jealous of our power. They care neither for the South nor the North. They hate both."&lt;ref&gt;Graebner pp. 60–61&lt;/ref&gt;

At the beginning of the Civil War, the U.S. minister to the Court of St. James was [[Charles Francis Adams, Sr.|Charles Francis Adams]]. He made clear that Washington considered the war strictly an internal insurrection affording the Confederacy no rights under international law. Any movement by Britain towards officially recognizing the Confederacy would be considered an unfriendly act towards the United States. Seward's instructions to Adams included the suggestion that it be made clear to Britain that a nation with widely-scattered possessions, as well as a homeland that included Scotland and Ireland, should be very wary of "set[ting] a dangerous precedent".&lt;ref&gt;Mahin p. 47. Taylor p. 177&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Richard Lyons, 1st Viscount Lyons|Lord Lyons]], an experienced diplomat, was the British minister to the US. He warned London about Seward:

{{quote|I cannot help fearing that he will be a dangerous foreign minister. His view of the relations between the United States and Great Britain had always been that they are a good material to make political capital of.... I do not think Mr. Seward would contemplate actually going to war with us, but he would be well disposed to play the old game of seeking popularity here by displaying violence toward us.&lt;ref&gt;Mahin p. 7. Mahin notes that Seward had talked in the 1850s of annexing Canada and in February 1861 had spoken frequently of reuniting the North and South by a foreign war.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Despite his distrust of Seward, Lyons, throughout 1861, maintained a "calm and measured" diplomacy that contributed to a peaceful resolution to the ''Trent'' crisis.&lt;ref name="Dubrulle p. 1234"&gt;Dubrulle p. 1234&lt;/ref&gt;

==Issue of diplomatic recognition (February–August 1861)==

The ''Trent'' affair did not erupt as a major crisis until late November 1861. The first link in the chain of events occurred in February 1861, when the Confederacy created a three person European delegation consisting of [[William Lowndes Yancey]], [[Pierre Adolphe Rost|Pierre Rost]], and [[Ambrose Dudley Mann]]. Their instructions from Confederate Secretary of State [[Robert Toombs]] were to explain to these governments the nature and purposes of the southern cause, to open diplomatic relations, and to "negotiate treaties of friendship, commerce, and navigation". Toombs' instructions included a long legal argument on states' rights and the right of secession. Because of the reliance on the double attack of cotton and legality, many important issues were absent from the instructions including the blockade of Southern ports, privateering, trade with the North, slavery, and the informal blockade the Southerners had imposed whereby no cotton was being shipped out.&lt;ref&gt;Donald, Baker, Holt pp. 311–312. Hubbard pp. 27–29&lt;/ref&gt;

British leaders—and those on the Continent—generally believed that division of the U.S. was inevitable. Remembering [[American Revolutionary War|their own unsuccessful attempt]] to keep their former American colonies in the Empire by force of arms, the British considered Union efforts to resist a ''fait accompli'' to be unreasonable, but they also viewed Union resistance as a fact that they had to deal with. Believing the war's outcome to be predetermined, the British saw any action they could take to encourage the end of the war as a humanitarian gesture. Lyons was instructed by Russell to use his own office and any other parties who might promote a settlement of the war.&lt;ref&gt;Jones pp. 3–4, 35&lt;/ref&gt;

The commissioners  met informally with Foreign Secretary [[John Russell, 1st Earl Russell|Lord Russell]] on  May 3. Although word of [[Battle of Fort Sumter|Fort Sumter]] had just reached London,  the immediate implications of open warfare were not discussed at the meeting. Instead the envoys emphasized the peaceful intent of their new nation and the legality of secession as a remedy to Northern violations of states' rights. They closed with their strongest argument: the importance of cotton to Europe. Slavery was discussed only when Russell asked Yancey whether the international [[Atlantic slave trade|slave trade]] would be reopened by the Confederacy &lt;ref&gt;The [[Confederate States Constitution]], drafted in March 1861, included an explicit prohibition on the importation of slaves from any source except the United States, but it was not ratified until February 1862.&lt;/ref&gt;(a position Yancey had advocated in recent years); Yancey's reply was that this was not part of the Confederacy's agenda. Russell was noncommittal, promising the matters raised would be discussed with the full Cabinet.&lt;ref&gt;Hubbard pp. 34–39. Walther p. 308. Russell had written to Lyons about the arrival of the three Confederates: "If it can possibly be helped, Mr. Seward must not be allowed to get us into a quarrel. I shall see the southerners when they come, but unofficially, and keep them at a proper distance." Graebner p. 64&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mean time, the British were attempting to determine what official stance they should have to the war. On May 13, 1861, on the recommendation of Russell, [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]] issued a declaration of neutrality that served as recognition of Southern [[Belligerent|belligerency]]—a status that provided Confederate ships the same privileges in foreign ports that U.S. ships received. {{wikisource|British proclamation of neutrality in the American Civil War}} Confederate ships could obtain fuel, supplies and repairs in neutral ports but could not secure military equipment or arms. The availability of Britain's far-flung colonial ports made it possible for Confederate ships to pursue Union shipping throughout much of the world. France, Spain, the Netherlands, and Brazil followed suit. Belligerency also gave the Confederate government the opportunity to purchase supplies, contract with British companies, and purchase a navy to search out and seize Union ships. The Queen's proclamation made clear that Britons were prohibited from joining the military of either side, equipping any ships for military use in the war, breaking any proper blockade, and from transporting military goods, documents, or personnel to either side.&lt;ref&gt;Mahin p. 48. Graebner p. 63. Donald, Baker, Holt p. 312&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Charles Francis Adams.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Charles Francis Adams, Sr.]] (1807–1886)]]

On May 18, Adams met with Russell to protest the declaration of neutrality.  Adams argued that Great Britain had recognized a state of belligerency "before they [the Confederacy] had ever showed their capacity to maintain any kind of warfare whatever, except within one of their own harbors under every possible advantage […] it considered them a maritime power before they had ever exhibited a single privateer upon the ocean." The major United States concern at this point was that the recognition of belligerency was the first step towards diplomatic recognition. While Russell indicated that recognition was not currently being considered, he would not rule it out in the future, although he did agree to notify Adams if the government's position changed.&lt;ref&gt;Mahin pp. 48–49. Hubbard p. 39. Jones p. 34&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, in Washington, Seward was upset with both the proclamation of neutrality and Russell's meetings with the Confederates. In a May 21 letter to Adams, which he instructed Adams to share with the British, Seward protested the British reception of the Confederate envoys and ordered Adams to have no dealings with the British as long as they were meeting with them.  Formal recognition would make Britain an enemy of the United States.  President Lincoln reviewed the letter, softened the language, and told Adams not to give Russell a copy but to limit himself to quoting only those portions that Adams thought appropriate.  Adams in turn was shocked by even the revised letter, feeling that it almost amounted to a threat to wage war against all of Europe.  When he met with Russell on June 12, after receiving the dispatch, Adams was told that Great Britain had often met with representatives of rebels against nations that Great Britain was at peace with, but that he had no further intention of meeting with the Confederate mission.&lt;ref&gt;Donald, Baker p. 314. Mahin pp. 48–49. Taylor pp. 175–179.  Taylor notes that British officials already believed that Seward would provoke an international crisis as a diversion from the Union's internal problems. For example, an article in the ''New York Times'', believed to have been planted by Seward in order to transmit a warning to Britain, had said that any permanent dissolution of the Union would invariably lead to United States acquisition of Canada.&lt;/ref&gt;

Further problems developed over possible diplomatic recognition when, in mid-August, Seward became aware that Britain was secretly negotiating with the Confederacy in order to obtain its agreement to abide by the [[Paris Declaration Respecting Maritime Law|Declaration of Paris]]. The 1856 Declaration of Paris prohibited signatories from commissioning [[privateers]] against other signatories, protected neutral goods shipped to belligerents except for "contrabands of war", and recognized blockades only if they were proved effective. The United States had failed to sign the treaty originally, but after the Union declared a blockade of the Confederacy, Seward ordered the U.S. ministers to Britain and France to reopen negotiations  to restrict the Confederate use of privateers.&lt;ref&gt;Mahin pp. 54–55.  The negotiations between the United States and Britain failed when Lord Russell, aware that the treaty would obligate the British to treat Confederate privateers as pirates, informed Adams on August 19, 1861 that, "Her Majesty does not intend thereby to undertake any engagement which shall have any bearing, direct or indirect, on the internal differences now prevailing in the United States."&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Richard Lyons, 1st Viscount Lyons - Project Gutenberg eText 13789.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Richard Lyons, 1st Viscount Lyons|Richard Bickerton Pemell Lyons, 1st Viscount Lyons]]]]

However, on May 18 Russell had instructed Lyons to seek Confederate agreement to abide by the Paris Declaration. Lyons assigned this task to Robert Bunch, the British consul in [[Charleston, South Carolina]], who was directed to contact [[South Carolina]] Governor [[Francis Wilkinson Pickens]]. Bunch exceeded his instructions: he bypassed Pickens, and openly assured the Confederates that agreement to the Paris Declaration was "the first step to [British] recognition". His indiscretion soon came to Union ears. Robert Mure, a British-born Charleston merchant, was arrested in [[New York (state)|New York]]. Mure, a colonel in the South Carolina militia, had a British diplomatic passport issued by Bunch, and was carrying a British [[diplomatic pouch]] (which was searched). The pouch contained some actual correspondence from Bunch to Britain, and also pro-Confederate pamphlets, personal letters from Southerners to European correspondents, and a Confederate dispatch which recounted Bunch's dealings with the Confederacy, including the talk of recognition.&lt;ref&gt;Berwanger, pp. 39–51&lt;/ref&gt;

When confronted Russell admitted that his government was attempting to get agreement from the Confederacy to adhere to the provisions of the treaty relating to neutral goods (but not privateering), but he denied that this was in any way a step towards extending diplomatic relations to the Confederates.  Rather than reacting as he had to the earlier recognition of belligerency, Seward let this matter drop. He did demand Bunch's recall, but Russell refused.&lt;ref&gt;Mahin pp. 54–56  Hubbard pp. 50–51&lt;/ref&gt;

Under Napoleon III, France's overall foreign policy objectives were at odds with Britain's, but France generally took positions regarding the Civil War combatants similar to, and often supportive of, Britain's.  Cooperation between Britain and France was begun in the U.S. between [[Henri Mercier]], the French minister, and Lyons. For example, on June 15 they tried to see Seward together regarding the  proclamation of neutrality, but Seward insisted that he meet with them separately.&lt;ref&gt;Warren pp. 79–80&lt;/ref&gt;

Edouard Thouvenel was the French Foreign Minister for all of 1861 until the fall of 1862. He was generally perceived to be pro-Union and was influential in dampening Napoleon's initial inclination towards diplomatic recognition of Confederate independence.  Thouvenel met unofficially with Confederate envoy Pierre Rost in June and told him not to expect diplomatic recognition.&lt;ref&gt;Mahin p. 98&lt;/ref&gt;

[[William L. Dayton]] of New Jersey was appointed by Lincoln as U.S. minister to France.  He had no foreign affairs experience and did not speak French, but was assisted a great deal by the U.S. consul general in Paris, [[John Bigelow]].  When Adams made his protest to Russell on the recognition of Confederate belligerency, Dayton made a similar protest to Thouvenel. Napoleon offered "his good office" to the United States in resolving the conflict with the South and Dayton was directed by Seward to acknowledge that "if any mediation were at all admissible, it would be his own that we should seek or accept." &lt;ref&gt;Mahin pp. 96–97&lt;/ref&gt;
 
When news of the Confederate victory at the [[First Battle of Bull Run]] reached Europe it reinforced British opinion that Confederate independence was inevitable.  Hoping to take advantage of this battlefield success, Yancey requested a meeting with Russell but was rebuffed and told that any communications should be in writing.  Yancey submitted a long letter on August 14 detailing again the reasons why the Confederacy should receive formal recognition and requesting another meeting with Russell. Russell's August 24 reply, directed to the commissioners "of the so-styled Confederate States of America" reiterated the British position that it considered the war as an internal matter rather than a war for independence.  British policy would change only if "the fortune of arms or the more peaceful mode of negotiation shall have determined the respective positions of the two belligerents."  No meeting was scheduled and this was the last communication between the British government and the Confederate diplomats.  When the ''Trent'' Affair erupted in November and December the Confederacy had no effective way to communicate directly with Great Britain and they were left totally out of the negotiation process.&lt;ref&gt;Walther pp. 316–318.  Hubbard, pp. 43–44, 55. Monaghan, p. 174.  Monaghan notes that as the news of the ''Trent'' Affair reached London, Russell made the following reply to written correspondence from the Confederate commissioners: "Lord Russell presents his compliments to Mr. Yancey, Mr. Rost, and Mr. Mann.  He has had the honor to receive their letters of the 27 and 30 November, but in the present state of affairs he must decline to enter into any official communication with them."&lt;/ref&gt;

By August 1861, Yancey was sick, frustrated, and ready to resign.  In the same month, President Davis had decided that he needed diplomats in Britain and France. Specifically, ministers that would be better suited to serve as Confederate ministers, should the Confederacy achieve international recognition.  He selected [[John Slidell]] of [[Louisiana]] and [[James Murray Mason|James Mason]] of [[Virginia]].  Both men were widely respected throughout the South, and had some background in foreign affairs.  Slidell had been appointed as a negotiator by President [[James K. Polk|Polk]] at the end of the [[Mexican–American War|Mexican War]], and Mason had been chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee from 1847 to 1860.&lt;ref&gt;Mahin, p. 58.  Hubbard, p. 58&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Robert Mercer Taliaferro Hunter|R. M. T. Hunter]] of Virginia was the new Confederate Secretary of State.  His instructions to Mason and Slidell were to emphasize the stronger position of the Confederacy now that it had expanded from seven to eleven states, with the likelihood that [[Maryland]], [[Missouri]], and [[Kentucky]] would also eventually join the new nation.  An independent Confederacy would restrict the industrial and maritime ambitions of the United States and lead to a mutually beneficial commercial alliance between Great Britain, France, and the Confederate States.  A balance of power would be restored in the Western Hemisphere as the United States' territorial ambitions would be restricted.  They were to liken the Confederate situation to Italy's struggles for independence which Britain had supported, and were to quote Russell's own letters which justified that support.  Of immediate importance, they were to make a detailed argument against the legality of the Union blockade.  Along with their formal written instructions, Mason and Slidell carried a number of documents supporting their positions.&lt;ref&gt;Hubbard pp. 58–59&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pursuit and capture (August–November 1861)==
[[Image:Charles-Wilkes.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Charles Wilkes]]]]

The intended departure of the diplomats was no secret,&lt;ref&gt;Weigley p. 78.  Weigley suggests an interesting alternative hypothesis to the traditional narrative of events when he writes, "The Confederate government may have intended the Mason-Slidell mission as a trap to bring the United States and Great Britain to war. The itinerary of the two emissaries was suspiciously well advertised. At Havana, they fraternized and dined with the officers of the ''San Jacinto'', again publicizing their departure plans.  On board the ''Trent'', Slidell appeared unduly eager to become a captive."&lt;/ref&gt; and the Union government received daily intelligence on their movements. By October 1 Slidell and Mason were in [[Charleston, South Carolina]]. Their original plan was to run the blockade in [[CSS Nashville (1861)|CSS ''Nashville'']], a fast steamer, and sail directly to Britain. But the main channel into Charleston was guarded by five Union ships, and ''Nashville's'' draft was too deep for any side channels.  A night escape was considered, but tides and strong night winds prevented this. An overland route through [[Mexico]] and departure from [[Matamoros, Tamaulipas|Matamoros]] was also considered, but the delay of several months was unacceptable.&lt;ref&gt;Hubbard pp. 60–61. Mahin p. 58.  Musicant p. 110&lt;/ref&gt;

The steamer ''Gordon'' was suggested as an alternative. She had a shallow enough draft to use the back channels and could make over 12 knots, more than enough to elude Union pursuit. ''Gordon'' was offered to the Confederate government either as a purchase for $62,000 or as a charter for $10,000. The Confederate Treasury could not afford this, but a local cotton broker, George Trenholm, paid the $10,000 in return for half the cargo space on the return trip. Renamed ''Theodora'', the ship left Charleston at 1 a.m. on October 12, and successfully evaded Union ships enforcing the blockade. On October 14, she arrived at [[Nassau, Bahamas|Nassau]] in the [[Bahamas]], but had missed connections with a British steamer going to [[Saint Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands|St. Thomas]] in the [[Danish West Indies]], the main point of departure for British ships from the Caribbean to Britain.&lt;ref&gt;Musicant pp. 110–111&lt;/ref&gt; However, they discovered that British mail ships might be anchored in [[Cuba|Spanish Cuba]], and ''Theodora'' turned southwest towards Cuba. ''Theodora'' appeared off the coast of Cuba on October 15, with her coal bunkers nearly empty. An approaching Spanish warship hailed ''Theodora''. Slidell and [[George Eustis, Jr.]] went aboard, and were informed that British mail packets did indeed dock at the port of [[Havana]], but that the last one had just left, and that the next one, the [[paddle steamer]] [[RMS Trent|RMS ''Trent'']], would arrive in three weeks. ''Theodora'' docked in [[Cárdenas, Cuba]] on October 16, and Mason and Slidell disembarked. The two diplomats decided to stay in Cardenas before making an overland trek to Havana to catch the next British ship.&lt;ref name="Trent Incident"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Musicant pp. 110–111.  Mahin p. 59&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, rumors reached the Federal government that Mason and Slidell had escaped aboard ''Nashville''. Union intelligence had not immediately recognized that Mason and Slidell had left Charleston on ''Theodora''. U.S. Navy Secretary [[Gideon Welles]] reacted to the rumor that Mason and Slidell had escaped from Charleston by ordering Admiral [[Samuel F. DuPont]] to dispatch a fast warship to Britain to intercept ''Nashville''. On October 15, the Union sidewheel steamer [[USS James Adger|USS ''James Adger'']], under the command of John B. Marchand, began steaming towards Europe with orders to pursue ''Nashville'' to the [[English Channel]] if necessary. ''James Adger'' reached Britain and docked in [[Southampton]] Harbor in early November.&lt;ref name="Trent Incident"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://h42day.100megsfree5.com/histanex/11anxs/08trent.html |title=Trent Incident |publisher=H42day.100megsfree5.com |date= |accessdate=2014-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The British government was aware that the United States would attempt to capture the diplomats and believed they were on ''Nashville''. Palmerston ordered a [[Royal Navy]] warship to patrol within the three-mile limit around ''Nashville'''s expected port of call, to assure that any capture would occur outside British territorial waters. This would avoid the diplomatic crisis that would result if ''James Adger'' pursued ''Nashville'' into British waters.  When ''Nashville'' arrived on November 21, the British were surprised that the envoys were not on board.&lt;ref&gt;Musicant p. 111. Monaghan p. 173&lt;/ref&gt;

The Union [[steam frigate]] {{USS|San Jacinto|1850|6}}, commanded by Captain [[Charles Wilkes]], arrived in St. Thomas on October 13. ''San Jacinto'' had cruised off the African coast for nearly a month before setting course westward with orders to join a U.S. Navy force preparing to attack [[Port Royal, South Carolina]]. However in St. Thomas, Wilkes learned that the Confederate raider [[CSS Sumter|CSS ''Sumter'']] had captured three U.S. merchant ships near [[Cienfuegos]] in July. Wilkes headed there, despite the unlikelihood that ''Sumter'' would have remained in the area. In Cienfuegos he learned from a newspaper that Mason and Slidell were scheduled to leave Havana on November 7 in the British mail packet [[RMS Trent|RMS ''Trent'']], bound first for St. Thomas and then England. He realized that the ship would need to use the "narrow [[Old Bahama Channel|Bahama Channel]], the only deepwater route between Cuba and the shallow Grand Bahama Bank". Wilkes discussed legal options with his second in command, Lt. [[Donald Fairfax|D. M. Fairfax]], and reviewed law books on the subject before making plans to intercept. Wilkes adopted the position that Mason and Slidell would qualify as "contraband", subject to seizure by a United States ship.&lt;ref&gt;Mahin, p. 59.  Donald, Baker, Holt, p. 315. Ferris, p. 22.  Wilkes later said that he had consulted "all the authorities on international law to which I had access, viz, Kent, Wheaton and Vattel, besides various decisions of Sir William Scott and other judges of the Admiralty Court of Great Britain." Musicant p. 111.  Musicant notes that the availability of the law texts on ''San Jacinto'' were the result of the complex legal situations that were likely to have been encountered in her two year anti-slave-trade patrol of the African coast.&lt;/ref&gt; Historians, however, have concluded that there was no legal precedent for the seizure.&lt;ref name="Campbell, pp.63–64"&gt;Campbell, pp. 63–64&lt;/ref&gt;

This aggressive decision making was typical of Wilkes' command style.  On one hand, he was recognized as "a distinguished explorer, author, and naval officer".&lt;ref&gt;Donald, Baker, Holt, p. 314&lt;/ref&gt;  On the other, he "had a reputation as a stubborn, overzealous, impulsive, and sometimes insubordinate officer".&lt;ref&gt;Mahin, p. 59&lt;/ref&gt; Treasury officer George Harrington had warned Seward about Wilkes: "He will give us trouble. He has a superabundance of self-esteem and a deficiency of judgment. When he commanded his [[United States Exploring Expedition|great exploring mission]] he court-martialed nearly all his officers; he alone was right, everybody else was wrong."&lt;ref&gt;Nevins pp. 387–388&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Trent and San Jacinto.jpg|thumb|upright|left|The ''San Jacinto'' (right) stopping the ''Trent'']]
''Trent'' left on November 7 as scheduled, with Mason, Slidell, their secretaries, and Slidell's wife and children aboard. Just as Wilkes had predicted, ''Trent'' passed through Bahama Channel, where ''San Jacinto'' was waiting. Around noon on November 8, lookouts aboard the ''San Jacinto'' spotted ''Trent'', which unfurled the [[Union Jack]] as it neared. ''San Jacinto'' then fired a shot across the bow of ''Trent'', which Captain James Moir of ''Trent'' ignored. ''San Jacinto'' fired a second shot from her forward pivot gun which landed right in front of ''Trent''. ''Trent'' stopped following the second shot. Lieutenant Fairfax was summoned to the quarterdeck, where Wilkes presented him with the following written instructions:

{{quote|On boarding her you will demand the papers of the steamer, her clearance from Havana, with the list of passengers and crew.

Should Mr. Mason, Mr. Slidell, [[George Eustis, Jr.|Mr. Eustice]] {{sic}} and Mr. McFarland be on board make them prisoners and send them on board this ship and take possession of her [the ''Trent''] as a prize. … They must be brought on board.

All trunks, cases, packages and bags belonging to them you will take possession of and send on board this ship; any dispatches found on the persons of the prisoners, or in possession of those on board the steamer, will be taken possession of, examined, and retained if necessary.&lt;ref&gt;Fairfax pp. 136–137&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Fairfax then boarded ''Trent'' from a cutter. Two cutters carrying a party of twenty men armed with pistols and cutlasses sidled up to ''Trent''.&lt;ref name="Trent Incident"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fairfax, p. 137&lt;/ref&gt; Fairfax, certain that Wilkes was creating an international incident and not wanting to enlarge its scope, ordered his armed escort to remain in the cutter. Upon boarding, Fairfax was escorted to an outraged Captain Moir, and announced that he had orders "to arrest Mr. Mason and Mr. Slidell and their secretaries, and send them prisoners on board the United States war vessel nearby". The crew and passengers then threatened Lieutenant Fairfax, and the armed party in the two cutters beside ''Trent'' responded to the threats by climbing aboard to protect him. Captain Moir refused Fairfax's request for a passenger list, but Slidell and Mason came forward and identified themselves. Moir also refused to allow a search of the vessel for contraband, and Fairfax failed to force the issue which would have required seizing the ship as a prize, arguably an act of war. Mason and Slidell made a formal refusal to go voluntarily with Fairfax, but did not resist when Fairfax's crewmen escorted them to the cutter.&lt;ref name="Trent Incident"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fairfax pp. 137–139. Ferris pp. 23–24&lt;/ref&gt;

Wilkes would later claim that he believed that ''Trent'' was carrying "highly important dispatches and were endowed with instructions inimical to the United States".  Along with the failure of Fairfax to insist on a search of ''Trent'', there was another reason why no papers were found in the luggage that was carried with the diplomats. Mason's daughter, writing in 1906, said that the Confederate dispatch bag had been secured by Commander Williams [[Royal Navy|RN]], a passenger on ''Trent'', and later delivered to the Confederate envoys in London.  This was a clear violation of the Queen's Neutrality Proclamation.&lt;ref&gt;Mahin, p. 60. Ferris, p. 22. Monaghan, p. 167.  Williams was the only British naval officer involved in the incident.&lt;/ref&gt;

International law required that when "contraband" was discovered on a ship, the ship should be taken to the nearest prize court for adjudication.  While this was Wilkes' initial determination, Fairfax argued against this since transferring crew from ''San Jacinto'' to ''Trent'' would leave ''San Jacinto'' dangerously undermanned, and it would seriously inconvenience ''Trent'''s other passengers as well as mail recipients.  Wilkes, whose ultimate responsibility it was, agreed and the ship was allowed to proceed to St. Thomas, absent the two Confederate envoys and their secretaries.&lt;ref&gt;Mahin, p. 61.  Ferris, pp. 25–26. Fairfax, p. 140. Fairfax adds the following in his account of the proceedings, "I gave my real reasons some weeks afterward to Secretary Chase, whom I met by chance at the Treasury Department, he having asked me to explain why I had not literally obeyed Captain Wilkes's instructions. I told him that it was because I was impressed with England's sympathy for the South and felt that she would be glad to have so good a ground to declare war against the United States. Mr. Chase seemed surprised, and exclaimed, 'You have certainly relieved the Government from great embarrassment, to say the least.{{'"}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''San Jacinto'' arrived in [[Hampton Roads]], Virginia on November 15, where Wilkes wired news of the capture to [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]].  He was then ordered to [[Boston]] where he delivered the captives to [[Fort Warren (Massachusetts)|Fort Warren]], a prison for captured Confederates.&lt;ref&gt;Mahin, p. 61&lt;/ref&gt;

==American reaction (November 16 – December 18, 1861)==
Most Northerners learned of the ''Trent'' capture on November 16 when the news hit afternoon newspapers. By Monday, November 18, the press seemed "universally engulfed in a massive wave of chauvinistic elation".  Mason and Slidell, "the caged ambassadors", were denounced as "knaves", "cowards", "snobs", and "cold, cruel, and selfish".&lt;ref&gt;Ferris, pp. 32–33.  Jones, p. 83. Jones wrote, "The seizure of these two Southerners in particular drew a triumphant response.  Mason had been a principle (sic) advocate of the hated [[Fugitive Slave Law]] and the [[Kansas-Nebraska Act]], and Slidell had earned a reputation as one of the most dedicated secessionists in Congress."  Charles Francis Adams, Jr., p. 541.  Charles Francis Adams, Jr., son of the U.S. Minister to Great Britain, wrote, "Probably no two men in the entire South were more thoroughly obnoxious to those of the Union side than Mason and Slidell."&lt;/ref&gt;

Everyone was eager to present a legal justification for the capture.  The British consul in Boston remarked that every other citizen was "walking around with a Law Book under his arm and proving the right of the S. Jacintho {{sic|nolink=y}} to stop H.M.'s mail boat". Many newspapers likewise argued for the legality of Wilkes' actions, and numerous lawyers stepped forward to add their approval.&lt;ref&gt;Ferris, pp. 33–35&lt;/ref&gt; Harvard law professor [[Theophilus Parsons (professor)|Theophilus Parsons]] wrote, "I am just as certain that Wilkes had a legal right to take Mason and Slidell from the ''Trent'', as I am that our government has a legal right to blockade the port of Charleston." [[Caleb Cushing]], a prominent [[Democratic Party (U.S.)|Democrat]], and former [[United States Attorney General|Attorney General]] (under [[Franklin Pierce]]) concurred: "In my judgment, the act of Captain Wilkes was one which any and every self-respecting nation must and would have done by its own sovereign right and power, regardless of circumstances." [[Richard Henry Dana, Jr.]], considered an expert on maritime law, justified the detention because the envoys were engaged "solely [in] a mission hostile to the United States", making them guilty of "treason within our municipal law".  [[Edward Everett]], a former minister to Great Britain and a former Secretary of State, also argued that "the detention was perfectly lawful [and] their confinement in Fort Warren will be perfectly lawful."&lt;ref&gt;Charles Francis Adams, Jr., pp. 548–549&lt;/ref&gt;

A banquet was given to honor Wilkes at the [[Revere House]] in Boston on November 26.  [[Massachusetts]] governor [[John A. Andrew]] praised Wilkes for his "manly and heroic success" and spoke of the "exultation of the American heart" when Wilkes "fired his shot across the bows of the ship that bore the British Lion at its head".  George T. Bigelow, the chief justice of  Massachusetts, spoke admiringly of Wilkes: "In common with all loyal men of the North, I have been sighing, for the last six months, for someone who would be willing to say to himself, 'I will take the responsibility.{{'"}}&lt;ref&gt;Charles Francis Adams, Jr., p. 547&lt;/ref&gt;  On December 2 Congress passed unanimously a resolution thanking Wilkes "for his brave, adroit and patriotic conduct in the arrest and detention of the traitors, James M. Mason and John Slidell" and proposing that he receive a "gold medal with suitable emblems and devices, in testimony of the high sense entertained by Congress of his good conduct".&lt;ref name="Charles Francis Adams, Jr., p. 548"&gt;Charles Francis Adams, Jr., p. 548&lt;/ref&gt;

But as the matter was given closer study, people began to have doubts.  [[Secretary of the Navy]] [[Gideon Welles]] reflected the ambiguity that many felt when he wrote to Wilkes of "the emphatic approval" of the Navy Department for his actions while cautioning him that the failure to take the ''Trent'' to a prize court "must by no means be permitted to constitute a precedent hereafter for the treatment of any case of similar infraction of neutral obligations".&lt;ref name="Charles Francis Adams, Jr., p. 548"/&gt; On November 24, the ''[[New York Times]]'' claimed to find no actual on point precedent. [[Thurlow Weed]]'s ''Albany Evening Journal'' suggested that, if Wilkes had "exercised an unwarranted discretion, our government will properly disavow the proceedings and grant England 'every satisfaction' consistent with honor and justice".&lt;ref&gt;Ferris, p. 34&lt;/ref&gt; It did not take long for others to comment that the capture of Mason and Slidell very much resembled the search and impressment practices that the United States had always opposed since its founding and which had previously led to the [[War of 1812]] with Britain. The idea of humans as contraband failed to strike a resonant chord with many.&lt;ref&gt;Jones  p. 83&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Henry Brooks Adams|Henry Adams]] wrote to his brother on the impressment issue:

{{quote|Good God, what's got into you all? What in Hell do you mean by deserting now the great principles of our fathers; by returning to the vomit of that dog Great Britain? What do you mean by asserting now principles against which every Adams yet has protested and resisted? You're mad, all of you.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, p. 89&lt;/ref&gt;}}

People also started to realize that the issue might be resolved less on legalities and more on the necessity of avoiding a serious conflict with Britain. Elder statesmen [[James Buchanan]], [[Thomas Ewing]], [[Lewis Cass]], and [[Robert J. Walker]] all publicly came out for the necessity of releasing them.  By the third week of December much of the editorial opinion started to mirror these opinions and prepare the American citizens for the release of the prisoners.&lt;ref&gt;Ferris, pp. 35–36&lt;/ref&gt;  The opinion that Wilkes had operated without orders and had erred by, in effect, holding a prize court on the deck of the ''San Jacinto'' was being spread.&lt;ref&gt;Donald, Holt, Baker, p. 315&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States was initially very reluctant to back down. Seward had lost the initial opportunity to immediately release the two envoys as an affirmation of a long-held U.S. interpretation of international law. He had written to Adams at the end of November that Wilkes had not acted under instructions, but would hold back any more information until it had received some response from Great Britain.  He reiterated that recognition of the Confederacy would likely lead to war.&lt;ref&gt;Nevins, pp. 392–393. Jones p. 89&lt;/ref&gt;
   
Lincoln was at first enthused about the capture and reluctant to let them go, but as reality set in he stated:

{{quote|I fear the traitors will prove to be white elephants. We must stick to American principles concerning the rights of neutrals. We fought Great Britain for insisting … on the right to do precisely what Captain Wilkes has done. If Great Britain shall now protest against the act, and demand their release, we must give them up, apologize for the act as a violation of our doctrines, and thus forever bind her over to keep the peace in relation to neutrals, and so acknowledge that she has been wrong for sixty years.&lt;ref&gt;Mahin, p. 62. Nevins, pp. 392–393&lt;/ref&gt;}}

On December 4, Lincoln met with [[Alexander Tilloch Galt|Alexander Galt]], the future Canadian Minister of Finance.  Lincoln told him that he had no desire for troubles with England or any unfriendly designs toward Canada. When Galt asked specifically about the ''Trent'' incident, Lincoln replied, "Oh, that'll be got along with." Galt forwarded his account of the meeting to Lyons who forwarded it to Russell.  Galt wrote that, despite Lincoln's assurances, "I cannot, however, divest my mind of the impression that the policy of the American Govt is so subject to popular impulses, that no assurance can be or ought to be relied on under present circumstances."&lt;ref&gt;Mahin, p. 64.  Warren, pp. 170–171&lt;/ref&gt; Lincoln's annual message to Congress did not touch directly on the ''Trent'' affair but, relying on estimates from [[United States Secretary of War|Secretary of War]] [[Simon Cameron]] that the U.S. could field a 3,000,000 man army, stated that he could "show the world, that while engaged in quelling disturbances at home we are able to protect ourselves from abroad".&lt;ref&gt;Warren, p. 170&lt;/ref&gt;

Finance also played a role: [[United States Secretary of the Treasury|Treasury Secretary]] [[Salmon P. Chase]] was concerned with any events that might affect American interests in Europe.  Chase was aware of the intent of New York banks to suspend [[Hard money (policy)|specie]] payments, and he would later make a lengthy argument at the Christmas cabinet meeting in support of Seward.  In his diary, Chase wrote that the release of Mason and Slidell "…was like gall and wormwood to me. But we cannot afford delays while the matter hangs in uncertainty, the public mind will remain disquieted, our commerce will suffer serious harm, our action against the rebels must be greatly hindered." &lt;ref&gt;Warren, p. 173&lt;/ref&gt;  Warren notes, "Although the ''Trent'' affair did not cause the national banking crisis, it contributed to the virtual collapse of a haphazard system of war finance, which depended on public confidence."&lt;ref&gt;Niven, pp. 270–273&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 15 the first news on British reaction reached the United States.  Britain first learned of the events on November 27.  Lincoln was with [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[Orville Browning]] when Seward brought in the first newspaper dispatches, which indicated Palmerston was demanding a release of the prisoners and an apology.  Browning thought the threat of war by Britain was "foolish" but said, "We will fight her to the death." That night at a diplomatic reception Seward was overheard by William H. Russell saying, "We will wrap the whole world in flames."&lt;ref&gt;Jones, p. 88.  Warren, pp. 174–175&lt;/ref&gt; The mood in Congress had also changed.  When they debated the issue on December 16 and 17, [[Clement L. Vallandigham]], a peace Democrat, proposed a resolution stating that the U.S. maintain the seizure as a matter of honor. The motion was opposed and referred to a committee by the vote of 109 to 16.&lt;ref&gt;Warren, pp. 175–176&lt;/ref&gt;  The official response of the government still awaited the formal British response which did not arrive in America until December 18.

==British reaction (November 27 – December 31, 1861)==

When the [[USS James Adger|USS ''James Adger'']] arrived in [[Southampton]] and Commander Marchand learned from ''[[The Times]]'' that his targets had arrived in Cuba, he reacted to the news by boasting that he would capture the two envoys within sight of the British shore if necessary, even if they were on a British ship.&lt;ref&gt;Mahin pp. 64–65. Nevins p. 389.   The ''Nashville'' had captured and destroyed the Union merchant ship ''Harvey Birch'' on its trip. Adams tried to have the ship declared a pirate. British authorities held it briefly in port, but by November 28 Russell had determined that she was properly documented as a CSA warship, and its officers were properly credentialed by the CSA. Ferris pp. 37–41&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of the concerns raised by Marchand's statements, the British Foreign Office requested a judicial opinion from the three Law Officers of the Crown (the queen's advocate, the attorney general, and the solicitor general) on the legality of capturing the diplomats from a British ship.&lt;ref&gt;Mahin p. 65&lt;/ref&gt;  The written reply dated November 12 declared:

{{quote|The United States' man-of-war falling in with the British mail steamer [this was the example used in the hypothetical submitted by the cabinet] beyond the territorial limits of the United Kingdom might cause her to bring-to, might board her, examine her papers, open the general mail bags, and examine the contents thereof, without, however opening any mail bag or packet addressed to any officer or Department of Her Majesty's Government.

The United States' ship of war may put a prize-crew on board the West India steamer, and carry her off to a port of the United States for adjudication by a Prize Court there; but she would have no right to move Messrs. Mason and Slidell, and carry them off as prisoners, leaving the ship to pursue her voyage.&lt;ref&gt;Baxter, "Papers Relating to Belligerent and Neutral Rights, 1861–1865 pp. 84–86.  Warren pp. 96–97.  Warren writes that at a cabinet meeting on November 11 Lord Chancellor Richard Bethell, an Admiralty judge for twenty three years, and Dr. Stephen Lushington, a judge on the High Court of the Admiralty, both argued that simply removing the envoys would not have been a violation of international law.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

On November 12 Palmerston advised Adams in person that the British nonetheless would take offense if the envoys were removed from a British ship.  Palmerston emphasized that seizing the Confederates would be "highly inexpedient in every way [Palmerston] could view it" and a few more Confederates in Britain would not "produce any change in policy already adopted". Palmerston questioned the presence of ''Adger'' in British waters, and Adams assured Palmerston that he had read Marchand's orders (Marchand had visited Adams while in Great Britain) which limited him to seizing Mason and Slidell from a Confederate ship.&lt;ref&gt;Mahin p. 65.  Ferris pp. 12–17. Warren pp. 95, 101&lt;/ref&gt;

The news of the actual capture of Mason and Slidell did not arrive in London until November 27.&lt;ref&gt;Donald, Baker p. 316. Mahin p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the public and many of the newspapers immediately perceived it as an outrageous insult to British honor, and a flagrant violation of [[maritime law]].  The ''London Chronicle''{{'}}s response was typical:

{{quote|Mr. Seward … is exerting himself to provoke a quarrel with all Europe, in that spirit of senseless egotism which induces the Americans, with their dwarf fleet and shapeless mass of incoherent squads which they call an army, to fancy themselves the equal of France by land and Great Britain by sea.&lt;ref&gt;Donald, Baker, and Holt p. 315&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The London ''Standard'' saw the capture as "but one of a series of premeditated blows aimed at this country … to involve it in a war with the Northern States".&lt;ref&gt;Warren p. 107&lt;/ref&gt;  A letter from an American visitor written to Seward declared, "The people are frantic with rage, and were the country polled I fear 999 men out of 1,000 would declare for immediate war."  A member of Parliament stated that unless America set matters right the British flag should "be torn into shreds and sent to Washington for use of the Presidential [[Flush toilet|water-closets]]".&lt;ref&gt;Warren p. 105&lt;/ref&gt; However, the seizure provoked only one anti-Union meeting, held in Liverpool (later a hub of Confederate sympathy) and chaired by the future Confederate spokesman James Spence.&lt;ref name="Campbell p. 67"&gt;Campbell p. 67&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Times'' published its first report from the United States on December 4, and its correspondent, [[William Howard Russell|W. H. Russell]], wrote of American reactions, "There is so much violence of spirit among the lower orders of the people and they are … so saturated with pride and vanity that any honorable concession … would prove fatal to its authors."&lt;ref&gt;Mahin p. 69&lt;/ref&gt; ''Times'' editor John T. Delane, however, took a moderate stance and warned the people not to "regard the act in the worst light" and to question whether it made sense that the United States, despite British misgivings about Seward that went back to the earliest days of the Lincoln administration, would "force a quarrel upon the Powers of Europe".&lt;ref&gt;Warren pp. 106–107&lt;/ref&gt; This restrained stance was common in Britain: "the press, as a whole, preached calm and praised it too, noting the general moderation of public temper it perceived".&lt;ref name=Campbell&gt;{{Citation|last=Campbell|first=Duncan|title=English Public Opinion and the American Civil War|year=2003|publisher=Royal Historical Society|isbn=0861932633|page=67|postscript=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The government got its first solid information on the ''Trent'' from Commander Williams who went directly to London after he arrived in England.  He spent several hours with the [[Admiralty]] and the prime minister. Initial reaction among political leaders was firmly opposed to the American actions.  [[George Villiers, 4th Earl of Clarendon|Lord Clarendon]], a former foreign secretary, expressed what many felt when he accused Seward of "trying to provoke us into a quarrel and finding that it could not be effected at Washington he was determined to compass it at sea".&lt;ref name="Warren p. 109"&gt;Warren p. 109&lt;/ref&gt;

Resisting Russell's call for an immediate cabinet meeting, Palmerston again called on the Law Officers to prepare a brief based on the actual events that had occurred, and an emergency cabinet meeting was scheduled two days later for Friday, November 29.  Palmerston also informed the War Office that budget reductions scheduled for 1862 should be put on hold.&lt;ref&gt;Ferris p. 44&lt;/ref&gt;  Russell met briefly with Adams on November 29 to determine whether he could shed any light on American intent. Adams was unaware that Seward had already sent him a letter indicating Wilkes had acted without orders and was unable to provide Russell any information that might defuse the situation.&lt;ref name="Warren p. 109"/&gt;

Palmerston, who believed he had received a verbal agreement from Adams that British vessels would not be interfered with, reportedly began the emergency cabinet meeting by throwing his hat on the table and declaring, "I don't know whether you are going to stand this, but I'll be damned if I do."&lt;ref name="Campbell p. 67"/&gt; The Law Officers' report was read and confirmed that Wilkes actions were:

{{quote|illegal and unjustifiable by international law. The "San Jacinto" assumed to act as a belligerent, but the "Trent" was not captured or carried into a port of the United States for adjudication as a prize, and, under the circumstances, cannot be considered as having acted in breach of international law. It follows, that from on board a merchant-ship of a neutral Power, pursuing a lawful and innocent voyage, certain individuals have been taken by force... Her Majesty's Government will, therefore, in our opinion, be justified in requiring reparation for the international wrong which has been on this occasion committed&lt;ref&gt;Baxter, "Papers Relating to Belligerent and Neutral Rights, 1861–1865 pp. 86–87&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Dispatches from Lyons were given to all in attendance. These dispatches described the excitement in America in support of the capture, referred to previous dispatches in which Lyons had warned that Seward might provoke such an incident, and described the difficulty that the United States might have in acknowledging that Wilkes had erred. Lyons also recommended a show of force including sending reinforcements to Canada. Palmerston indicated to Lord Russell that it was very possible that the entire incident had been a "deliberate and premeditated insult" designed by Seward to "provoke" a confrontation with Britain.&lt;ref&gt;Jones pp. 84–85. Ferris p. 52.  Mahin p. 69. Lyons, in a private letter, reported to Palmerston that (although he could not "vouch for the truth" of his source) he had heard that unbeknownst to Lincoln, Seward had directly ordered the capture by Wilkes. Mahin p. 70&lt;/ref&gt;

After several days of discussion, on November 30 Russell sent to Queen Victoria the drafts of the dispatches intended for Lord Lyons to deliver to Seward. The Queen in turn asked her husband and consort, [[Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha|Prince Albert]], to review the matter. Although ill with [[typhoid fever|typhoid]] that would shortly take his life, Albert read through the dispatches,  decided the ultimatum was too belligerent, and composed a softened version. In his November 30 response to Palmerston, Albert wrote:

{{quote|The Queen … should have liked to have seen the expression of a hope [in the message to Seward] that the American captain did not act under instructions, or, if he did that he misapprehended them [and] that  the United States government must be fully aware that the British Government could not allow its flag to be insulted, and the security of her mail communications to be placed in jeopardy, and [that] Her Majesty's Government are unwilling to believe that the United States Government intended wantonly to put an insult upon this country and to add to their many distressing complications by forcing a question of dispute upon us, and that we are therefore glad to believe … that they would spontaneously offer such redress as alone could satisfy this country, viz: the restoration of the unfortunate passengers and a suitable apology.&lt;ref&gt;Mahin pp. 68–69&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The cabinet incorporated in its official letter to Seward Albert's suggestions that would allow Washington to disavow both Wilkes' actions and any American intent to insult the British flag. The British still demanded an apology and the release of the Confederate emissaries.&lt;ref&gt;Jones p. 85&lt;/ref&gt; Lyons' private instructions directed him to give Seward seven days to reply and to close the British Legation in Washington and return home if a satisfactory response was not forthcoming. In a further effort to defuse the situation, Russell added his own private note telling Lyons to meet with Seward and advise him of the contents of the official letter before it was actually delivered. Lyons was told that as long as the commissioners were released, the British would "be rather easy about the apology" and that an explanation sent through Adams would probably be satisfactory.  He reiterated that the British would fight if necessary, and suggested that the "best thing would be if Seward could be turned out and a rational man put in his place." The dispatches were shipped on December 1 via the ''Europa'', reaching Washington on December 18.&lt;ref&gt;Ferris pp. 52–53&lt;/ref&gt;

===Diplomacy on hold===
While military preparations were accelerated, diplomacy would be on hold for the rest of the month while Britain waited for the American response.  There had been unrest in the British financial markets since the news of the ''Trent'' was first received.  [[Consols]], which had initially declined in value in the early part of the month, fell by another 2 percent, reaching the level during the first year of the [[Crimean War]].  Other securities fell another 4 to 5 percent. Railway stocks and colonial and foreign securities declined.  The ''Times'' noted that the financial markets were reacting as if war were a certainty.&lt;ref&gt;Warren pp. 146–147&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early deliberations over the appropriate British response to the capture of the diplomats, there was concern that Napoleon III would take advantage of a Union-British war to act against British interests in "Europe or elsewhere".&lt;ref&gt;Ferris p. 76.  Clarendon in September, anticipating the U.S. would pick a fight with Britain wrote that he felt "N[apoleon] w[oul]d instantly leave us in the lurch and do something in Europe w[hic]h we can't stand."&lt;/ref&gt; French and British interests clashed in [[Indochina]], in building the [[Suez Canal]], in Italy, and in Mexico.  Palmerston saw French stockpiling of [[coal]] in the [[West Indies]] as indicating France was preparing for war with Britain.  The French Navy remained smaller, but had otherwise shown itself equal to the Royal in the Crimean War. A possible buildup of [[Ironclad warship|ironclad]]s by the French would present a clear threat in the [[English Channel]].&lt;ref&gt;Warren p. 85&lt;/ref&gt;

France quickly alleviated many of Britain's concerns.  On November 28, with no knowledge of the British response or any input from Mercier in the U.S., Napoleon met with his cabinet.  They had no doubts about the illegality of the U.S. actions and agreed to support whatever demands Britain made. Thouvenel wrote to [[Charles Joseph, comte de Flahaut|Count Charles de Flahault]] in London to inform Britain of their decision.  After learning of the actual content of the British note, Thouvenel advised the British ambassador [[Henry Wellesley, 1st Earl Cowley|Lord Cowley]], that the demand had his complete approval, and on December 4 instructions were sent to Mercier to support Lyons.&lt;ref&gt;Ferris p. 79&lt;/ref&gt;

A minor stir occurred when General [[Winfield Scott]], until recently the commander of all Union troops, and [[Thurlow Weed]], a known confidant of Seward, arrived in Paris.  Their mission, to counter Confederate propaganda efforts with propaganda efforts of their own, had been determined before the ''Trent'' affair, but the timing was considered odd by Cowley. Rumors circulated that Scott was blaming the whole incident on Seward who had somehow manipulated Lincoln into acquiescing with the seizure.  Scott put the rumors to rest with a December 4 letter that was published in the Paris ''Constitutional'' and reprinted throughout Europe, including most London papers.  Denying the rumors, Scott stated that "every instinct of prudence as well as of good neighborhood prompts our government to regard no honorable sacrifice too great for the preservation of the friendship of Great Britain."&lt;ref&gt;Ferris pp. 80–84&lt;/ref&gt;

The benign intentions of the United States were also argued by [[John Bright]] and [[Richard Cobden]], strong supporters of the United States and leaders of the [[Anti-Corn Law League]] in Britain. Both had expressed strong reservations about the legality of American actions, but argued strongly that the United States had no aggressive designs against Great Britain.  Bright publicly disputed that the confrontation had been intentionally engineered by Washington. In an early December speech to his constituents, he condemned the British military preparations "before we have made a representation to the American Government, before we have heard a word from it in reply, [we] should be all up in arms, every sword leaping from its scabbard and every man looking about for his pistols and blunderbusses?"  Cobden joined with Bright by speaking at public meetings and by writing letters to newspapers, organizers of meetings that he could not attend, and influential people in and out of Britain. As time passed and voices opposing war were heard more and more, the Cabinet also began considering alternatives to war, including arbitration.&lt;ref&gt;Warren pp. 149–152&lt;/ref&gt;

===Military preparations (December 1860 – December 1861)===

Even before the Civil War erupted, Britain, with her worldwide interests, needed to have a military policy regarding the divided United States. In 1860 [[Rear admiral (Royal Navy)|Rear Admiral]] [[Sir Alexander Milne, 1st Baronet|Sir Alexander Milne]] took command of the North America and West Indies station of the Royal Navy.  On December 22, 1860, with secession still in its early stages, Milne's orders were to avoid "any measure or demonstration likely to give umbrage to any party in the United States, or to bear the appearance of partizanship{{sic}} on either side; if the internal dissensions in those States should be carried to the extent of separation". Until May 1861, in compliance with these instructions and as part of a long-standing policy of the Royal Navy to avoid ports where desertion was likely, Milne avoided the American coast.  In May the Neutrality Proclamation of May 13 was issued. This increased British concern over the threat of Confederate privateers and Union blockading ships to British neutral rights, and Milne was reinforced. On June 1 British ports were closed to any naval prizes, a policy that was of great advantage to the Union.  Milne did monitor the effectiveness of the Union blockade, but no effort to contest its effectiveness was ever attempted, and the monitoring was discontinued in November 1861.&lt;ref&gt;Baxter, ''The British Government and Neutral Rights'' pp. 10–12&lt;/ref&gt;

Milne received a letter from Lyons on June 14 that said he did not "regard a sudden declaration of war against us by the United States as an event altogether impossible at any moment".  Milne warned his scattered forces, and in a June 27 letter to the Admiralty asked for further reinforcements and deplored the weakness of the defenses in the West Indies.  Referring to Jamaica, Milne reported conditions that included, "works badly contrived and worse executed—unserviceable guns—decayed gun cartridges—corroded shot—the absence of stores of all kinds and of ammunition, with dilapidated and damp powder magazines".&lt;ref&gt;Baxter, ''The British Government and Neutral Rights'' p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; Milne made it clear that his existing forces were totally absorbed simply in protecting commerce and defending possessions, many inadequately. He had only a single ship available "for any special service that may be suddenly required".&lt;ref name="Bourne p. 601"&gt;Bourne p. 601&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Edward Seymour, 12th Duke of Somerset|Duke of Somerset]], the [[First Lord of the Admiralty]], opposed Palmerston's inclination to reinforce Milne.  He felt that the existing force made up largely of steam ships was superior to the primarily sail ships of the Union fleet, and he was reluctant to incur additional expenses while Britain was in the process of rebuilding her fleet with iron ships. This resistance by Parliament and the cabinet led historian Kenneth Bourne to conclude, "When, therefore the news of the ''Trent'' outrage arrived in England the British were still not properly prepared for the war which almost everyone agreed was inevitable if the Union did not back down."&lt;ref&gt;Bourne pp. 604–605&lt;/ref&gt;

====Land forces====

On the land, at the end of March 1861, Britain had 2,100 regular troops in [[Nova Scotia]], 2,200 in the rest of Canada, and scattered posts in [[British Columbia]], [[Bermuda]], and the West Indies. [[Sir William Williams, 1st Baronet, of Kars|Lieutenant General Sir William Fenwick Williams]], [[Commander in Chief, North America]], did what he could with his small forces, but he wrote repeatedly to the authorities back in Britain that he needed considerable reinforcements to prepare his defenses adequately.&lt;ref name="Bourne p. 601"/&gt;

Some land reinforcements were sent in May and June. However when Palmerston, alarmed by the blockade and the Trent affair, pressed for increasing the number of regular troops in Canada to 10,000, he met resistance. [[Sir George Cornewall Lewis, 2nd Baronet|Sir George Cornwall Lewis]], head of the War Office, questioned whether there was any real threat to Great Britain. He judged it "incredible that any Government of ordinary prudence should at a moment of civil war gratuitously increase the number of its enemies, and, moreover, incur the hostility of so formidable a power as England". In the debate in Parliament on June 21 there was general opposition to reinforcements, based on political, military, and economic arguments.  A long standing issue was the attempt by Parliament to shift more of the burden of Canadian defense to the local government. Colonial secretary [[Henry Pelham-Clinton, 5th Duke of Newcastle-under-Lyne|Newcastle]], felt that the requests by Williams were part of a pattern of the "last few years" in which he had "been very fertile of demands and suggestions". Newcastle was also concerned that there were no winter quarters available for additional troops and he feared desertions would be a serious problem.&lt;ref&gt;Bourne pp. 602–605&lt;/ref&gt;

From the beginning of the ''Trent'' crisis British leaders were aware that a viable military option was an essential part of defending the nation's interests.  The First Lord of the Admiralty believed Canada could not be defended from a serious attack by the U.S. and winning it back later would be difficult and costly. Bourne noted, "After 1815 the ambiguity of Anglo-American relations, the parsimony of the house of commons [sic] and the enormous practical difficulties involved always seemed to have prevented adequate preparations being made for an Anglo-American war."&lt;ref&gt;Bourne p. 600&lt;/ref&gt; Somerset suggested a naval war as opposed to a ground war.&lt;ref&gt;Ferris p. 63&lt;/ref&gt;

Military preparation began quickly after news of the ''Trent'' reached Great Britain. Secretary of War Sir George Lewis proposed within a week to send "thirty thousand rifles, an artillery battery, and some officers to Canada".  He wrote to Lord Palmerston on December 3, "I propose to engage a [[Cunard Line|Cunard]] Steamer &amp; send out one regiment &amp; one battery of artillery next week" followed as quickly as possible by three more regiments and more artillery.&lt;ref&gt;Ferris p. 64&lt;/ref&gt; Given realities of the North Atlantic in winter, however, the reinforcements would have to land in Nova Scotia, since the St. Lawrence begins to ice up in December.

Russell was concerned that Lewis and Palmerston might take actions prematurely that would eliminate what chances for peace that there were, so he requested "a small committee …[to] assist Lewis, &amp; the Duke of Somerset" with their war plans.  The group was created and convened on December 9. The group consisted of Palmerston, Lewis, Somerset, Russell, Newcastle, [[Granville Leveson-Gower, 2nd Earl Granville|Lord Granville]] (foreign secretary) and the [[Prince George, Duke of Cambridge|Duke of Cambridge]] (commander-in-chief of the British Army), advised by [[George Robinson, 1st Marquess of Ripon|Earl de Grey]] (Lewis' undersecretary), [[John Colborne, 1st Baron Seaton|Lord Seaton]] (a former commander-in-chief in Canada), General [[John Fox Burgoyne]] (the inspector general of fortifications) and Colonel P. L. MacDougall (the former commander of the Royal Canadian Rifles). The first priority of the committee was Canadian defense, and the committee relied on both plans developed by previous explorations of the issue and information that the committee developed on its own from the testimony of experts.&lt;ref&gt;Ferris p. 64. Warren p. 133. Bourne p. 607&lt;/ref&gt;

The current resources in Canada consisted of five thousand regular troops and about an equal number of "ill-trained" militia of which only one-fifth were organized. During December the British managed to send 11,000 troops using 18 transport ships and by the end of the month they were prepared to send an additional 28,400 men. By the end of December, as the crisis ended, reinforcements had raised the count to 924 officers and 17,658 men against an anticipated American invasion of from 50,000 to 200,000 troops.&lt;ref&gt;Warren pp. 132–133. Mahin p. 72. Ferris p. 65. Ferris indicates in footnote no. 30 on page 219 that his account is based largely on Bourne who "is the only scholar, I believe, who has examined most of the pertinent archival sources".&lt;/ref&gt; Including the units sent overland and the British forces already in the Province of Canada, British field forces in the province would have amounted to nine infantry battalions and four field artillery batteries by mid-March, 1862, a force equivalent to three brigades (i.e., one division), with four infantry battalions and two field artillery batteries (the equivalent of two more brigades) split between New Brunswick and Nova Scotia.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, pp. 60–63&lt;/ref&gt; There were also 12 batteries of garrison artillery – six in the Province of Canada, three in Nova Scotia, two in New Brunswick and one in Newfoundland—and three companies of engineers in Canada, plus various headquarters, service, and support elements including two battalions of the Military Train&lt;ref&gt;Bourne, p. 615; Campbell, p. 64&lt;/ref&gt;

Five infantry battalions, three field artillery batteries, and six garrison artillery batteries moved by sea from Halifax, Nova Scotia, to St. John, New Brunswick, then overland by sleigh from St. John to Riviere du Loup, Province of Canada, between January 1, 1862 and March 13, 1862. The 10-day-long overland passage, and the railway from Riviere du Loup to Ville du Quebec, was within a day's march of the border (in some locations, the overland trail was almost within rifle shot from U.S. territory in Maine), so the British staff planned on deploying infantry to defend the road, if necessary. The 96th Regiment, travelling on the ''Calcutta'', reached New Brunswick in February; the other half were forced to abandon their voyage in the [[Azores]] when their ship, the ''Victoria'', nearly sank.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, p. 64; see also the description by Sir John Pakington and Lord Clarence Paget, ''Hansard'', 13 March 1862 vol. 165 cc. 1452–56&lt;/ref&gt; The Headquarters staff, who landed in Halifax on 5 January 1862 after the crisis was over, decided to take a quicker route to Montreal and, covering up their military baggage labels to disguise their identities, took a Cunard steamer to Boston from where they caught the railway to Montreal.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, p. 64&lt;/ref&gt;

In Canada, General Williams had toured the available forts and fortifications in November and December.  Historian Gordon Warren wrote that Williams found that, "forts were either decaying or nonexistent, and the amount of necessary remedial work was stupefying."&lt;ref&gt;Warren p. 134.  Warren further wrote, "At Toronto and Kingston, he proposed earthworks with heavy ordnance, and allocated two hundred men for extending and strengthening them.  A new ten-gun battery was to replace the rusty cannon overlooking the Grand Trunk Railway tracks, wharf, and channel, and a Royal Artillery officer arrived to instruct men in its use. Williams wanted to blow bridges over the St. Lawrence and, in the event of attack, close Toronto by sinking ships.  Desperate moves were necessary."&lt;/ref&gt; To defend Canada, the British government estimated their manpower requirements as 10,000 regulars and 100,000 auxiliary troops, the latter forming garrisons and harassing the enemy's flanks and rear.&lt;ref&gt;Bourne, p. Warren, p. 134&lt;/ref&gt; Canada offered two potential sources of such auxiliary troops: the Sedentary Militia, which consisted of all Canadian males between ages 16 and 50, and volunteer organisations similar to the British [[Volunteer Force (Great Britain)|rifle volunteers]]. Bourne summed up these two forces as follows:

{{quote|In spite of its proud record—or perhaps because of it—the Canadian militia had been allowed to decline into a mere paper force.  By law the entire male population between eighteen and sixty was liable for service but the vast majority of these, the sedentary militia, had no existence beyond enrolment.  The only active force, the volunteers, received a mere six or twelve days' annual training according to the arm of the service, and of the 5,000 authorized there were only some 4,422 in June 1861 – a "miserable small force! And many of them but ill-trained, unless greatly improved since last year", was Newcastle's comment.&lt;ref name="Bourne p. 611"&gt;Bourne p. 611&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Williams' task in raising, arming and disciplining this army was not dissimilar to the one that the Union and Confederates had faced at the beginning of the Civil War, a year earlier. In the Province of Canada there were 25,000 arms, 10,000 of them smoothbores, and in the Maritimes there were 13,000 rifles and 7,500 smoothbores: though weapons were readily available in England, the difficulty was in transporting them to Canada.&lt;ref name="Bourne p. 611"&gt;Bourne p. 611&lt;/ref&gt; 30,000 Enfield rifles were sent on December 6 with the ''Melbourne'', and by February 10, 1862 the ''Times'' reported that modern arms and equipment for 105,550 had arrived in Canada along with 20 million cartridges.&lt;ref&gt;''Times'', 10 February 1862, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 2, at Williams' urging, the Canadian government agreed to raise its active volunteer force to 7,500. The risk of war pushed the number of volunteers to 13,390 by May 1862, although the number of "efficient" volunteers was only 11,940.&lt;ref&gt;Chartrand, Rene Canadian Military Heritage, Vol. II: 1755–1871; Directorate of History, Department of National Defence of Canada, Ottawa, 1965, p. 189; Dr. J. Mackay Hitsman, ''Report No. 6: Canadian Militia Prior to Confederation'', Directorate of History, Canadian Forces Headquarters (1966), p. 142; ''New York Times'', 26 June 1864&lt;/ref&gt; On December 20, Williams also began training one company of 75 men from each battalion of the Sedentary Militia, about 38,000 men in total, with the intention of raising this to 100,000.&lt;ref&gt;Warren p. 133; Brian Jenkins, ''Britain and the War for the Union'' vol. 1, (Montreal, 1974), p. 233&lt;/ref&gt; Warren describes the Sedentary militia on their initial muster, before arms and equipment were served out to them:

{{quote|Untrained and undisciplined, they showed up in all manner of dress, with belts of basswood bark and sprigs of green balsam in their hats, carrying an assortment of flintlocks, shotguns, rifles, and scythes. Their officers, prefacing orders with "please", recoiled in horror as formations of the backwoodsmen zigzagged on command to wheel to the left.&lt;ref&gt;Warren p. 133; see also Edward Robert Cameron, ''Memoirs of Ralph Vansittart'' (Toronto, 1902), pp. 52–54 at [https://archive.org/details/memoirsofralphva00cameuoft archive.org]&lt;/ref&gt;  }}

By the summer of 1862, long after the crisis had subsided, the available Canadian volunteers numbered 16,000; 10,615 infantry; 1,615 cavalry; 1,687 artillery; 202 volunteer engineers besides new corps not yet accepted into service and the militia.&lt;ref&gt;United Service Magazine, 101(1), 10&lt;/ref&gt; Militia returns for 1862 show 470,000 militiamen in Canada,&lt;ref&gt;Sessional Papers of the Parliament of the Province of Canada, Volume 21, Part 5&lt;/ref&gt; but with the volunteers it was not expected to raise more than 100,000 Canadian troops for active service.&lt;ref&gt;HL Deb 20 February 1865 vol 177 cc. 416–40&lt;/ref&gt; It was within the context of a generally unprepared Canadian military that military ground plans were formulated—plans contingent on troops that would not be available until spring 1862.&lt;ref&gt;Warren p. 135&lt;/ref&gt; Canada was not prepared for war with the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Warren pp. 34–35&lt;/ref&gt; In the War Cabinet there had been disagreement between MacDougall, who believed that the Union would suspend the war and turn its full attention to Canada, and Burgoyne, who believed the war would continue.  Both agreed, however that Canada would face a major ground assault from the United States—an assault that both recognized would be difficult to oppose.&lt;ref&gt;Bourne p. 609.  Bourne wrote, "The vast length of the exposed frontier made it virtually impossible for the British to defend it in its entirety—but, worse, the Americans were peculiarly well placed to attack it.  They not only had superior local resources in men and material, they also had excellent communications for concentrating those resources upon the frontier and for reinforcing them from the heart of commercial and industrial America—in fact sufficiently good communications in MacDougall's view to outweigh the difficulties of a winter campaign."&lt;/ref&gt; The defense depended on "an extensive system of fortifications" and "seizing command of the lakes". While Burgoyne stressed the natural tactical advantages of fighting on the defense out of strong fortifications, the fact was that the fortification plans previously made had never been executed. On the [[Great Lakes]], both Canada and the United States had no naval assets to speak of in November.  The British would be vulnerable here at least until the spring of 1862.&lt;ref&gt;Bourne pp. 610–613.  On the lake situation Bourne wrote, "Quite clearly there could be no hope of securing the command of the lakes unless adequate preparations were made in advance of hostilities.  But the time was peculiarly unfavorable for such measures; the whole question of colonial military expenditure had recently been investigated by a committee of the house of commons whose bias was plainly to encourage greater efforts on the part of the colonists themselves. On 17 October, therefore, Somerset had concluded that the defence of all the lakes would be 'very difficult' and that the main effort must be left to the Canadians themselves, though 'perhaps with proper arrangements we might defend [[Lake Ontario]] and Kingston Dockyard.' But even for this limited programme no preparation had been made by the time Lewis raised the matter at the Cabinet of 4 December. Nor was anything done later."&lt;/ref&gt;

====Invasion plans====

In order to counter their weaknesses to an American offensive, the idea of a Canadian invasion of the United States was proposed.  It was hoped that a successful invasion would occupy [[Portland, Maine|Portland]] and large sections of [[Maine]], requiring the U.S. to divert troops that would otherwise be occupied with an invasion of Canada directed at its east-west communication and transportation lines. Burgoyne, Seaton, and MacDougall all supported the plan and Lewis recommended it to Palmerston on December 3. However no preparations for this attack were ever made, and success depended on the attack being initiated at the very beginning of the war.&lt;ref&gt;Bourne pp. 620–621. On December 26 de Gray had prepared a memorandum indicating 7,640 troops would be needed for the initial attack. MacDougall had prepared a memorandum on December 3 in which he suggested that 50,000 troops would be necessary to guarantee success.&lt;/ref&gt;  MacDougall believed that "a strong party is believed to exist in Maine in favor of annexation to Canada" (a belief that Bourne characterizes as "dubious"), and that this party would assist a British invasion.  The Admiralty [[hydrography|hydrographer]], Captain Washington, and Milne both felt that if such a party existed that it would be best to postpone an attack and wait until it became apparent that "the state was inclined to change masters."&lt;ref&gt;Bourne pp. 625–626.  Washington wrote, "Possibly a very strict blockade, without an attack, might induce the people of Maine to consider whether it would not be for their interest to declare themselves independent of the United States, and so profit by all the advantages that would be derived from railway communication with Canada and the Lakes."&lt;/ref&gt;

====Naval forces====

It was at sea that the British had their greatest strength and their greatest ability to bring the war to the United States if necessary. The Admiralty, on December 1, wrote to Russell that Milne "should give his particular attention to the measures that may be necessary for the protection of the valuable trade between America, the West Indies, and England". However Somerset issued provisional orders to British naval units around the world to be prepared to attack American shipping wherever it might be found. The Cabinet was also agreed that establishing and maintaining a tight blockade was essential to British success.&lt;ref&gt;Baxter, ''The British Government and Neutral Rights'' p. 16.  Bourne pp. 623–627&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1864 Milne wrote that his own plan was:

{{quote|… to have secured our own bases, especially Bermuda and [[City of Halifax|Halifax]], raised the blockade of the Southern Ports by means of the squadron then at Mexico under the orders of Commodore Dunlop and that I had with me at Bermuda and then to have immediately blockaded as effectually as my means admitted the chief Northern Ports, and to have acted in [[Chesapeake Bay]] in co-operation with the Southern Forces …&lt;ref&gt;Baxter, ''The British Government and Neutral Rights'' p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Regarding possible joint operations with the Confederacy, Somerset wrote to Milne on December 15:

{{quote|…generally it will be well to avoid as much as possible any combined operations on a great scale (except as far as the fleet may be concerned), under any specious project such as for an attack on Washington or [[Baltimore]]; — experience proves almost invariably the great evils of combined operations by armies of different countries; and in this case, the advantage of the enemy of the defensive station will far more than compensate for the union of forces against it.&lt;ref&gt;Bourne p. 627 fn 4&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Somerset was opposed to attacking heavily fortified positions and Milne concurred:

{{quote|The object of the war can of course only be considered to cripple the enemy.  That is his trade and of his trade it can only be his shipping.  No object would be gained if the Forts alone are to be attacked, as modern views deprecate any damage to a town.  If ships are fired upon in a Port the town must suffer; therefore the shipping cannot be fired on.  This actually reserves operations to against vessels at sea.  If a town is undefended or the defenses subdued an embargo might be put on it and a subsidy demanded.&lt;ref&gt;Bourne p. 625&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The British strongly believed that they had naval superiority over the Union. Although Union ships outnumbered Milne's available force, many of the United States fleet were simply remodeled merchant ships, and the British had an advantage in the number of total guns available.  Bourne suggested that this advantage could change during the war as both sides turned more to ironclads.  In particular, British ironclads had a deeper draught and could not operate in American coastal waters, leaving a close blockade dependent on wooden ships vulnerable to Union ironclads.&lt;ref&gt;Bourne pp. 623–624&lt;/ref&gt;

Of course, the military option was not needed. If it had been, Warren concluded that, "Britain's world dominance of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries had vanished; the Royal Navy, although more powerful than ever, no longer ruled the waves."&lt;ref&gt;Warren p. 154&lt;/ref&gt;  Military historian Russell Weigley concurs in Warren's analysis and adds:

{{quote|The Royal Navy retained the appearance of maritime supremacy principally because it existed in a naval vacuum, with no serious rivals except for halfhearted and sporadic challenges by the French. At that, the British Navy would have had a difficult time making itself felt on the North American coast. The coming of steam power had destroyed the ability of its best warships to cruise indefinitely in American waters as the blockading squadrons had done in 1812. Even with a major base at Halifax, or possible aid from Confederate ports, the British Navy would have found it a precarious venture to try to keep station on the U.S. Coast. No steam navy operated with success against any reasonably formidable enemy at the distances from its home ports that a trans-Atlantic war would have imposed on the British fleet until the U.S. Navy fought the Japanese in World War II.&lt;ref&gt;Weigley pp. 80–81&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Some contemporaries were less sanguine about the U.S. Navy's prospects in a war with Britain. On 5 July 1861, Lieutenant [[David Dixon Porter]] wrote to his old friend, Assistant Secretary of the Navy [[Gustavus Fox]]:

{{quote|I went on board a small English screw sloop the other day (the {{HMS|Jason|1859|3}}) and with her one [[Armstrong gun]] (which some folks say is a failure, but I say is not), she would whip the largest ship in the Navy out of her boots, or more properly speaking her pumps, as ships don't wear boots. The point-blank range of this Armstrong gun is 1 ½ miles which settles the question for none of our guns will more than reach that with the greatest elevation.&lt;ref&gt;Regis A. Courtemanche, ''No Need of Glory: the British Navy in American Waters 1860–1864'' (Annapolis, 1977), p. 22&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In February 1862, the Duke of Cambridge, the British Army's commander-in-chief, gave his analysis of British military reaction to the ''Trent'' affair:

{{quote|I do not at all regret the demonstration, though we are not as it appears to have war.  It will be a valuable lesson to the Americans, and to the World at large, and will so prove to all what England can and will do, when the necessity for so doing arises.  It also established the fact that we are not that insignificant military Power, which some people are disposed to make out, and that the military organization of our departments is now such, that at any moment we can be, and are prepared should it arise. It also proves that we have an able staff to conduct the details of a difficult operation.&lt;ref&gt;Bourne p. 630. Bourne wrote (p. 231), "By the destruction of American shipping, by a severe blockade, by the harassing of the Northern coastal cities and perhaps by the occupation of Maine the British might, while being unable to secure a decisive military victory, not only draw off the enemy from hard-pressed Canada and inspire the South morally and materially, but, above all, so sap the North's moral and economic strength as to bring her Government to sue for peace on unfavourable terms."&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Resolution (December 17, 1861 – January 14, 1862)==
On December 17, Adams received Seward's November 30 dispatch stating that Wilkes acted without orders, and Adams immediately told Russell.  Russell was encouraged by the news, but deferred any action until a formal response to the British communication was received.  The note was not released to the public, but rumors were published by the press of the Union intent.  Russell refused to confirm the information, and John Bright later asked in Parliament, "How came it that this dispatch was never published for the information of the people of this country?"&lt;ref&gt;Mahin, p. 73&lt;/ref&gt;

In Washington, Lyons received the official response and his instructions on December 18.  As instructed, Lyons met with Seward on December 19 and described the contents of the British response without actually delivering them.  Seward was told that the British would expect a formal reply within seven days of Seward's receipt of the official communication.  At Seward's request, Lyons gave him an unofficial copy of the British response which Seward immediately shared with Lincoln.  On Saturday December 21 Lyons visited Seward to deliver the "British ultimatum", but after further discussion they agreed that the formal delivery would be postponed for another two days.  Lyons and Seward reached an agreement that the seven-day deadline should not be considered as part of the official communication from the British government.&lt;ref&gt;Ferris, pp. 131–135&lt;/ref&gt;

Senator [[Charles Sumner]], Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and a frequent consultant to President Lincoln on foreign relations, had recognized immediately that the United States must release Mason and Slidell, but he had remained publicly silent during the weeks of high excitement.  Sumner had traveled in England and carried on regular correspondence with many political activists in Britain. In December, he received particularly alarming letters from Richard Cobden and John Bright.  Bright and Cobden discussed the preparations of the government for war and the widespread doubts, including their own, of the legality of Wilkes' actions. The [[Elizabeth Campbell, Duchess of Argyll|Duchess of Argyll]], a strong antislavery advocate in Great Britain, wrote Sumner that the capture of the envoys was "the maddest act that ever was done, and, unless the [United States] government intend to force us to war, utterly inconceivable."&lt;ref&gt;Donald, pp. 31–36&lt;/ref&gt;

Sumner took these letters to Lincoln, who had just learned of the official British demand.  Sumner and Lincoln met daily over the next week and discussed the ramifications of a war with Great Britain.  In a December 24 letter Sumner wrote that the concerns were over the British fleet breaking the blockade and establishing their own blockade, French recognition of the Confederacy and movement into Mexico and Latin America, and the post-war (assuming Confederate independence) widespread smuggling of British manufactures via the South that would cripple American manufacturing. Lincoln thought that he could meet directly with Lyons and "show him in five minutes that I am heartily for peace", but Sumner persuaded him of the diplomatic impropriety of such a meeting. Both men ended up agreeing that arbitration might be the best solution, and Sumner was invited to attend a cabinet meeting scheduled for Christmas morning.&lt;ref&gt;Donald, pp. 36–38&lt;/ref&gt;

Relevant information from Europe flowed to Washington right up to the time of the cabinet meeting. On December 25 a letter written on December 6 by Adams was received in Washington. Adams wrote:

{{quote|The passions of the country are up and a collision is inevitable if the Government of the United States should, before the news reaches the other side, have assumed the position of Captain Wilkes in a manner to preclude the possibility of explanation. … Ministers and people now fully believe it is the intention of the [U.S.] Government to drive them into hostilities.&lt;ref&gt;Mahin, p. 70.  Ferris, p. 180&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Two messages from American consuls in Great Britain were also received at the same time.  From Manchester the news was that Britain was arming "with the greatest energy" and from London the message was that a "strong fleet" was being built with work going on around the clock, seven days a week.  Thurlow Weed, who had moved from Paris to London to ensure that General Scott's letter was circulated, also sent a letter advising Seward that "such prompt and gigantic preparations were never known."&lt;ref&gt;Ferris, p. 80&lt;/ref&gt;

The disruption of trade threatened the Union war effort as well as British prosperity. British India was the only source of the [[Potassium nitrate|saltpeter]] used in Union [[gunpowder]].&lt;ref&gt;Alfred D. Chandler, Jr., "Du Pont, Dahlgren, and the Civil War Nitre Shortage", ''Military Affairs'' vol. 13, no. 3 (1949) pp. 142, 144–45&lt;/ref&gt; Within hours of learning of the ''Trent'' Affair Russell moved to halt the export of saltpeter&lt;ref&gt;Donald, Holt, Baker p. 316. Ferris p. 62&lt;/ref&gt; and two days later the Cabinet banned the export of arms, ammunition, military stores and lead.&lt;ref&gt;Jenkins, ''Britain and the War for the Union'' vol. 1, p. 214&lt;/ref&gt; Britain was one of the few sources of weapons designated "first class" by the Union army,&lt;ref&gt;Dr. Christopher R Gabel, ''US Army Staff Ride Handbook for the Vicksburg Campaign'' (2001), p. 32&lt;/ref&gt; and between 1 May 1861 and 31 December 1862 it supplied more than 382,500 muskets and rifles and 49,982,000 [[percussion cap]]s to the Union.&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth Poolman, ''The Alabama Incident'' (London, 1958), p. 159, quoting [[John Laird (shipbuilder)|John Laird MP]]'s speech to the House of Commons on 27 March 1863&lt;/ref&gt; One historian concluded of the Union's source of weapons that "The domestic market, which consisted of few sporting arms and a few hastily manufactured and often inferior rifles and muskets, was soon exhausted… Foreign arms became the major source of supply in the first year and a half of the war… British and European arms allowed the Union army to take the field early in the war." &lt;ref&gt;Carl L Davis, ''Arming the Union: Small Arms in the Civil War'' (Port Washington, London: 1973), pp. 170–72&lt;/ref&gt;

The wider U.S. economy was soon hit by the effects of the ''Trent'' crisis. On December 16, the actions of the British cabinet reached New York: the stock exchange fell across the board, with government securities dropping by 2.5 per cent and the sterling exchange rising by two points, and an overall suspension seemed imminent.&lt;ref&gt;Jenkins, ''Britain and the War for the Union'', p. 223; Wesley C. Mitchell, "The Suspension of Specie Payments, December 1861", ''Journal of Political Economy'' vol. 7, no. 3 (June, 1899), p. 320&lt;/ref&gt; On December 20, Salmon P. Chase's broker refused to sell some of the secretary's holdings of railway stock because they were almost worthless, and informed him that the business community "trust you will have allayed this excitement with England: one war at a time is enough".&lt;ref&gt;Jenkins, ''Britain and the War for the Union'', vol. 1, pp. 223–24&lt;/ref&gt; A run on New York banks followed the stock market troubles, with $17,000,000 being withdrawn in three weeks, and on December 30 the banks voted by 25-15 to suspend specie payments.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, "The Suspension of Specie Payments", p. 322&lt;/ref&gt; Banks across the country soon followed them, with only those of Ohio, Indiana and Kentucky continuing to redeem in coin.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, "The Suspension of Specie Payments", pp. 323–24&lt;/ref&gt; This suspension left the Treasury unable to pay its suppliers, contractors or soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;McPherson, ''Battle Cry of Freedom'', p. 444&lt;/ref&gt; Though the crisis was resolved soon afterwards, these difficulties were not: on January 10, Lincoln asked Quartermaster General [[Montgomery C. Meigs (1816–1892)|Meigs]] "General, what shall I do? The people are impatient; [[Salmon P. Chase|Chase]] has no money, and he tells me he can raise no more; the General of the Armies has typhoid fever. The bottom is out of the tub. What shall I do?"&lt;ref&gt;Harold Holzer (ed.), ''Lincoln on War'' (Chapel Hill, 2011), p. 123&lt;/ref&gt; The Treasury was eventually forced to issue [[fiat money]] in the form of [[Greenback (money)|"greenbacks"]] to meet its obligations.&lt;ref&gt;McPherson, ''Battle Cry of Freedom'', p. 445&lt;/ref&gt;

With all of the negative news, the official response from France also arrived. Dayton had already told Seward of his own meeting with Thouvenel, in which the French foreign minister had told him that Wilkes' actions were "a clear breach of international law" but that France would "remain a spectator in any war between the United States and England".&lt;ref&gt;Mahin, p. 98.  Warren, p. 158.  The words in quotes are Dayton's.&lt;/ref&gt;  A direct message was received on Christmas Day from Thouvenel (it was actually delivered during the cabinet meeting) urging that the United States release the prisoners and in so doing affirm the rights of neutrals on the seas that France and the United States had repeatedly argued against Great Britain.&lt;ref&gt;Weigley, p. 79.  Ferris, pp. 181–182&lt;/ref&gt;

Seward had prepared a draft of his intended response to the British prior to the cabinet meeting and he was the only one present who had a detailed, organized position to present. His main point in the debate was that releasing the prisoners was consistent with the traditional American position on the right of neutrals, and the public would accept it as such. Both Chase and Attorney General [[Edward Bates]] were strongly influenced by the various messages from Europe, and Postmaster [[Montgomery Blair]] had been in favor of releasing the captives even before the meeting.  Lincoln clung to arbitration but received no support, the primary objection being the time that would be involved and an impatient Britain. No decision was made at the meeting and a new meeting was scheduled for the next day. Lincoln indicated he wished to prepare his own paper for this meeting. The next day Seward's proposal to release the prisoners was accepted without dissent.  Lincoln did not submit a counter argument, indicating afterwards to Seward that he had found he was unable to draft a convincing rebuttal to Seward's position.&lt;ref&gt;Ferris, pp. 181–183. Taylor, p. 184&lt;/ref&gt;

Seward's reply was "a long, highly political document".&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, p. 184&lt;/ref&gt;  Seward stated that Wilkes had acted on his own and denied allegations by the British that the seizure itself had been conducted in a discourteous and violent manner.  The capture and search of ''Trent'' was consistent with international law, and Wilkes' only error was in failing to take ''Trent'' to a port for judicial determination.  The release of the prisoners was therefore required in order "to do to the British nation just what we have always insisted all nations ought to do to us". Seward's reply, in effect, accepted Wilkes' treatment of the prisoners as contraband and also equated their capture with the British exercise of impressment of British citizens off of neutral ships.&lt;ref&gt;Ferris, p. 184&lt;/ref&gt; This response contradicted itself in a number of ways. Citing the precedent of impressment implied that Mason and Slidell had been removed for their status as American nationals, rather than as contraband; it was a reversal of America's previous position on the topic, referred to a right the British had not exercised for half a century, and—as Mason and Slidell were taken prisoner rather than being conscripted into the navy—was irrelevant to the case.&lt;ref name="Campbell, pp.63–64"/&gt; More fundamentally, Seward's stance assumed that a state of war was in effect: otherwise, Federal warships would have had no legal status as belligerents with the right of search. However, at the time of the Trent Affair, the North was not only refusing to acknowledge a state of war, but was still demanding that the British government withdraw its recognition of Confederate belligerency in the form of the Proclamation of Neutrality.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, pp. 64–65&lt;/ref&gt;

Lyons was summoned to Seward's office on December 27 and presented with the response.  Focusing on the release of the prisoners rather than Seward's stated analysis of the situation, Lyons forwarded the message and decided to remain in Washington until further instructions were received. The news of the release was published by December 29 and the public response was generally positive.  Among those opposed to the decision was Wilkes who characterized it "as a craven yielding and an abandonment of all the good … done by [their] capture".&lt;ref&gt;Ferris, pp. 188–191&lt;/ref&gt;

Mason and Slidell were released from Fort Warren and boarded the [[Royal Navy]] [[screw sloop]] HMS ''Rinaldo'' at [[Provincetown, Massachusetts]]. The ''Rinaldo'' took them to St. Thomas; on January 14, they left on the British mail packet ''La Plata'' bound for Southampton. The news of their release reached Britain on January 8. The British accepted the news as a diplomatic victory.  Palmerston noted that Seward's response contained "many doctrines of international law" contrary to the British interpretation, and Russell wrote a detailed response to Seward contesting his legal interpretations, but, in fact, the crisis was over.&lt;ref&gt;Ferris, pp. 192–196&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==

Historian Charles Hubbard describes the Confederate perspective to the resolution of the crisis:

{{quote|The resolution of the ''Trent'' affair dealt a serious blow to Confederate diplomatic efforts.  First, it deflected the recognition momentum developed during the summer and fall of 1861. It created a feeling in Great Britain that the United States was prepared to defend itself when necessary, but recognized its responsibility to comply with international law.  Moreover, it produced a feeling in Great Britain and France that peace could be preserved as long as the Europeans maintained strict neutrality in regard to the American belligerents.&lt;ref&gt;Hubbard  p. 64&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The issue of diplomatic recognition of the Confederacy, however, remained alive. It was considered further throughout 1862 by the British and French governments within the context of formally extending an offer, difficult to refuse, for mediation of the war.  As the war in America intensified and the bloody results of the [[Battle of Shiloh]] became known, the humanitarian reasons for European intervention seemed to have more merit.&lt;ref&gt;Jones pp. 117–137&lt;/ref&gt;  However the [[Emancipation Proclamation]] announced in September, 1862, made it clear that the issue of slavery was now at the forefront of the war.  At first the British reaction to the [[Battle of Antietam]] and the preliminary announcement of the Emancipation Proclamation was that this would only create a slave rebellion within the South as the war itself became progressively more violent.&lt;ref&gt;Jones pp. 138–180&lt;/ref&gt; Only in November 1862 did the momentum for European intervention reverse course.&lt;ref&gt;Jones p. 223&lt;/ref&gt;

Historians have given special credit to Seward and Lincoln for their handling of the crisis. Seward always favored handing back the captives. Lincoln, realizing the disaster that war would bring, also had to deal with an angry public opinion. Biographer James Randall argues that Lincoln's contribution was decisive, as it lay:

&lt;blockquote&gt;in his restraint, his avoidance of any outward expression of truculence, his early softening of State Department's attitude toward Britain, his deference toward Seward and Sumner, his withholding of his own paper prepared for the occasion, his readiness to arbitrate, his golden silence in addressing Congress, his shrewdness in recognizing that war must be averted, and his clear perception that a point could be clinched for America's true position at the same time that full satisfaction was given to a friendly country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=James Garfield Randall|title=Lincoln the President: Springfield to Gettysburg|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Vi8aAQAAIAAJ|year=1946|page=50}} quoted in Kevin Peraino,  ''Lincoln in the World: The Making of a Statesman and the Dawn of American Power'' (2013) pp. 160–61&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Tunneling''' or '''tunnelling''' is [[Financial crime|financial fraud]] committed by "the transfer of assets and profits out of firms for the benefit of those who control them".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last1 = Johnson| first1 = Simon| last2 = La Porta| first2 = Rafael| last3 = Lopez-de-Silanes| first3 = Florencio| last4 = Shleifer| first4 = Andrei| title = Tunneling| year = 2000| journal = [[American Economic Review]]| volume = 90| issue = 2| pages = 22–27| jstor = 117185}}&lt;/ref&gt; In legal terms, this is known as a [[Fraudulent conveyance|fraudulent transfer]]. For example, a group of major [[shareholders]] or the [[management]] of a publicly traded company orders that company to sell off its assets to a second company at unreasonably low prices. The shareholders or management typically own the second company outright, and thus profit from the otherwise disastrous sale. Tunneling differs from outright theft because people who engage in tunneling generally comply with all of the relevant legal procedures; it is thus a subtler scheme than simply writing checks from a company to a private bank account. While people widely agree that tunneling is unethical, penalties for it vary widely; some states impose criminal sanctions, whereas other states provide either for civil suits only, or for no sanctions at all.

== Origin ==
The word 'tunneling' was probably first used in this way in the [[Czech Republic]] (''tunelování'' in [[Czech language|Czech]], ''tunelář'' for the person committing fraud) during the first half of the 1990s, when several large, previously [[privatization|privatised]] banks and factories unexpectedly went [[bankrupt]]. It was discovered later that the managements of these companies were deliberately transferring company property and [[real estate]] into their own private businesses, sometimes in [[Offshoring|offshore]] locations.

The term became a common label for this kind of criminal activity among Czechs and [[Slovaks]].  The term subsequently appeared in specialized literature in English, and then in a broader literature during the [[Asian financial crisis]] in the late 1990s.

== Examples ==
The most common scheme in [[Central Europe]] in the post-privatization era was transferring funds and property from high [[cash flow]] [[corporation]]s to companies privately owned by the very same management. Transfers were accomplished via huge loans that were issued without any expectation of repayment, via massive overpayment for [[outsourcing|outsourced]] services, or simply by selling a corporation's real estate for a fraction of its [[market price]].  The main conditions enabling such a fraud is weak law against [[conflict of interests]], non-existent [[criminal law|legal liability]] of managers for leading their employer towards bankruptcy, and incompetence of financial authorities.

A typical example was the huge industrial complex [[Škoda Works]] in [[Plzeň]], [[Czech Republic]], which was ''tunneled'' by its top manager. The fraud, together with failures in management strategy, resulted in bankruptcy (2001) and then restructuring of the company. The manager was later acquitted by a court, which claimed that "such practices were common at the time". &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kawaciukova |first1=Zuzana |title=Ex-Skoda Plzen director cleared |url=http://www.praguepost.com/P03/2003/Art/0424/busi2.php |website=The Prague Post |accessdate=23 March 2015 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070312191341/http://www.praguepost.com/P03/2003/Art/0424/busi2.php |archivedate=March 12, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The typical 7-Step 'Tunneling' Process:'''

'''Step 1:''' Identify and incentivise a trusted company 'insider', usually in the finance dept, that will be willing to trample over company compliance and authorisations—and enter secretly into a loan/loans—with a person 'outside' of the company. 'Granting' a partial or a full 'security' over some of, or over the assets, or over the entire business and all of its assets.

'''Step 2:'''  Rapidly run down the cash in the company, usually by buying and holding in inventory equipment and stock—that is unnecessary at that time.

'''Step 3:''' At short (sometimes only 24–48 hours) notice, announce that the company is 'insolvent'—and have the company immediately forced into a bankruptcy process.

'''Step 4:''' The 'only'/'main creditor' is of course the local 'outsider'—and so it is THEY that dominates a rapidly assembled 'creditors committee'—which similarly rapidly agrees to sell some or all of the company assets.... to a holding company that THEY already control.

'''Step 5:''' Knowing that the original owners are eventually likely to seek justice and also the re-establishment of ownership of their assets, the 'tunnelers' next typically pay a local Police Dept officer, to file (knowingly false) 'charges'—against the original owner of the company—usually by claiming that a 'loan' or 'loans' (which the original owners were entirely unaware of!) were 'taken, with no intention of repaying them'.

'''Step 6:''' The 'tunnelers' typically pay a local Local/Regional Court official, to:
(a) accept the knowingly false 'charges'
(b) hold 'Court Hearings', without serving any formal Notice on the victim—the original owners
(c) gain 'convictions' against the original owners.

'''Step 7:''' The 'tunneler' next offers a 'Settlement Agreement'—under which:
(i) they get to keep all of the misappropriated assets, that they have 'legitimately' purchased from the 'creditor's committee'.
(ii) they have a clause included, whereby the original owner agrees to waive all rights—to ever sue the 'tunnelers' in the future.
(iii) the 'tunnelers' agree to retract all of the knowing false claims and allegations—that they made against the original owner—thereby quashing all any 'convictions' or ongoing legal proceedings.

'''''United States v. Stevens''''', 559 U.S. 460 (2010), was a decision by the [[Supreme Court of the United States]], which ruled that {{usc|18|48}},&lt;ref&gt;The version of this statute the Court invalidated had entered into effect on December 9, 1999, as {{USPL|106|152}}.&lt;/ref&gt; a federal statute criminalizing the commercial production, sale, or possession of depictions of cruelty to animals, was an unconstitutional abridgment of the [[First Amendment of the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] right to freedom of speech.

After this ruling, the statute was revised by the [[Animal Crush Video Prohibition Act of 2010]] to have much more specific language indicating it was intended only to apply to "crush videos."

==Background==
Robert J. Stevens, an author and small-time film producer who presented himself as an authority on pit bulls, compiled, and sold videotapes showing dogfights. Though he did not participate in the dogfights, he received a 37-month sentence under a 1999 federal law that banned trafficking in "depictions of animal cruelty."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/21/us/21scotus.html | work=The New York Times | first=Adam | last=Liptak | title=Supreme Court Rejects Ban on Animal Cruelty Videos | date=April 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===District Court===
Public Law No: 106-152 was a federal criminal statute that prohibited the knowing creation, sale, or possession of depictions of [[cruelty to animals]] with the intention of placing the depiction in interstate or foreign commerce for commercial gain. The law had been enacted in 1999, primarily to target "[[crush videos]]," which depicted people crushing small animals to gratify a [[sexual fetish]]. It excluded from prosecution "any depiction that has serious religious, political, scientific, educational, journalistic, historical, or artistic value." The language tracked the "[[Miller test]]," used by the U.S. Supreme Court to determine whether speech could be prosecuted for obscenity or was protected by the First Amendment.

In 2004, Stevens was indicted under 18 U.S.C. § 48 for creating and selling three video tapes, two of which depicted [[pit bull]]s engaged in [[dog fighting]]. The third tape depicted a pit bull attacking a domestic pig as part of the dog being trained to catch and kill wild hog and included "a gruesome depiction of a pit bull attacking the lower jaw of a domestic farm pig."&lt;ref name="third decision"&gt;[http://www.ca3.uscourts.gov/opinarch/052497p.pdf Opinion of the Third Judicial Circuit on ''United States v. Stevens'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Stevens' criminal prosecution concerned only three tapes, he had made $20,000 in two and a half years from selling nearly 700 videos.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abanet.org/publiced/preview/briefs/pdfs/07-08/08-769_PetitionerAmCuTheCenter.pdf Brief of the Center on the Administration of Criminal Law as ''Amicus Curiae'' in Support of Petitioner]&lt;/ref&gt; Stevens was not accused of engaging in animal cruelty himself or of shooting the original footage from which the videos were created. However, the footage in each of the videos "is accompanied by introductions, narration and commentary by Stevens, as well as accompanying literature of which Stevens is the author."&lt;ref name="3rdCircuitAppeal"/&gt;

Stevens filed a [[motion to dismiss]] the indictment by arguing that the federal statute abridged his right to freedom of speech under the First Amendment.  The [[United States District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania|District Court]] denied his motion in November 2004.&lt;ref name="3rdCircuitAppeal"&gt;[http://www.ca3.uscourts.gov/opinarch/052497p.pdf Robert J. Stevens Appeal to the Third Circuit Court]&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2005, Stevens was convicted by a jury, after a deliberation of 45 minutes.&lt;ref&gt;Ward, Paula Reed. [http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/08352/935594-85.stm#ixzz0KfTBX5yw&amp;D "Animal Cruelty Case Pushed to Top Court"], ''[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]'', December 17, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

===Third Circuit===
Stevens appealed, and the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit|Third Circuit]] vacated his conviction, holding that 18 U.S.C. 48 violated the First Amendment. The court stated that dog fighting and the use of dogs to hunt hogs may be made illegal to protect animals from cruelty.

However  the court ruled that the law in question, prohibiting the depiction of animal cruelty, violates the First Amendment, as it would create a new category of speech that is not protected by the free speech provision of the Amendment.&lt;ref name="third decision" /&gt;

===Review by Supreme Court===
The government appealed, asking that the Supreme Court overturn the appellate court ruling.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scotusblog.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/08-769_pet.pdf Petition for Writ of Certiorari]&lt;/ref&gt; On April 20, 2009, the Supreme Court agreed to review the lower court's decision.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dailywrit.com/2009/04/supreme-court-grants-review-in-animal-crueltyfirst-amendment-case/ "Supreme Court Grants Review in Animal Cruelty/First Amendment Case"], Daily Writ, April 20, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Oral arguments in the case were heard on October 6, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;Liptak, Adam. [https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/07/us/07scotus.html "Court Hears Free-Speech Case on Dogfight Videos"], ''[[New York Times]]'', October 6, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Stevens' attorney, Washington, D.C., lawyer [[Patricia Millett]], has written:

{{Quote|The notion that Congress can suddenly strip a broad swath of never-before-regulated speech of First Amendment protection and send its creators to federal prison, based on nothing more than an ad hoc balancing of the 'expressive value' of the speech against its 'societal costs' is entirely alien to constitutional jurisprudence and a dangerous threat to liberty.&lt;ref name=CSM8509&gt;Richey, Warren. [http://www.csmonitor.com/2009/1005/p02s01-usju.html "Supreme Court to decide case on animal cruelty and free speech"], ''[[Christian Science Monitor]]''. October 5, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In June 2009 the [[Animal Legal Defense Fund]] filed a brief in defense of the animals' interests. The brief encouraged the Court to recognize the protection of animals as a compelling government interest and to uphold Section 48.&lt;ref&gt;[http://aldf.org/downloads/USvStevens_AnimalLegalDefenseFund_amicus.pdf Brief ''Amicus Curiae'' of Animal Legal Defense Fund in Support of Petitioner]&lt;/ref&gt;

More than a dozen media outlets joined an ''amicus'' brief in support of Stevens, including [[The New York Times]], [[National Public Radio]], the [[American Society of News Editors]], the [[Association of Alternative Newsweeklies]], [[Citizen Media Law Project]], [[MediaNews Group]], the [[National Press Photographers Association]], the [[Newspaper Association of America]], the [[Newspaper Guild]]–[[Communications Workers of America]], [[Outdoor Writers Association of America]], the [[Radio-Television News Directors Association]], the [[Society of Environmental Journalists]], and the [[Society of Professional Journalists]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abanet.org/publiced/preview/briefs/pdfs/07-08/08-769_RespondentAmCu14NewsMediaOrgs.pdf  Brief ''Amicus Curiae'' of the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press and Thirteen News Media Organizations in Support of Respondent]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Decision== 
On April 20, 2010, the Supreme Court affirmed the appellate court ruling in an 8–1 decision written by Chief Justice [[John G. Roberts|Roberts]], with Justice [[Samuel Alito|Alito]] dissenting.&lt;ref&gt;Certeriorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. [https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/09pdf/08-769.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; The Court found that Section 48 was substantially overbroad and so was invalid under the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution]].

===Alito's dissent===
Alito dissented, explaining "(t)he most relevant of our prior decisions is ''[[New York v. Ferber|Ferber]]'', 458 U. S. 747, which concerned child pornography. The Court there held that child pornography is not protected speech, and I believe that ''Ferber''’s reasoning dictates a similar conclusion here."&lt;ref&gt;''United States v. Stevens'', Docket No. 08-769, Alito dissent, pg.13.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
On April 21, one day after the Supreme Court struck down the law, its original sponsor, Representative [[Elton Gallegly]] (R-CA) introduced a new bill with much more specific language, indicating it was intended only to apply to "crush videos."&lt;ref&gt;[http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/unleashed/2010/04/animal-cruelty-videos-law-supreme.html Local congressman introduces new bill to stop the sale of animal cruelty videos]&lt;/ref&gt;

President [[Barack Obama]] signed the bill into law on December 9, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ruthann Robson|Robson, Ruthann]] (2010-12-14) [http://lawprofessors.typepad.com/conlaw/2010/12/animal-porn-criminalized-by-federal-law-again.html Animal Porn - Criminalized by Federal Law Again], ''Constitutional Law Prof Blog''&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''War of the Austrian Succession''' ({{Lang-de|Österreichischer Erbfolgekrieg}}, 1740–1748) involved most of the [[Power in international relations|powers]] of Europe over the issue of [[Maria Theresa|Archduchess Maria Theresa]]'s succession to the [[Habsburg Monarchy]]. The war included peripheral events such as [[King George's War]] in [[British America]], the [[War of Jenkins' Ear]] (which formally began on 23 October 1739), the [[First Carnatic War]] in [[Nizam of Hyderabad|India]], the [[Jacobite rising of 1745]] in Scotland, and the [[First Silesian War|First]] and [[Second Silesian War]]s.

The cause of the war was Maria Theresa' alleged ineligibility to succeed to her father [[Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles VI]]'s various crowns, because [[Salic law]] precluded royal inheritance by a woman. This was to be the key justification for [[Kingdom of France|France]] and [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]], joined by [[Electorate of Bavaria|Bavaria]], to challenge Habsburg power. Maria Theresa was supported by [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Britain]], the [[Dutch Republic]], [[Kingdom of Sardinia|Sardinia]] and [[Electorate of Saxony|Saxony]].

Spain, which had been at war with Britain over colonies and trade since 1739, entered the war on the Continent to re-establish its influence in northern Italy, further reversing Austrian dominance over the Italian peninsula that had been achieved at Spain's expense as a consequence of Spain's [[War of the Spanish Succession|war of succession]] earlier in the 18th century.

The war ended with the [[Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (1748)|Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle]] in 1748, by which Maria Theresa was confirmed as Archduchess of Austria and Queen of Hungary, but Prussia retained control of [[Silesia]]. The peace was soon to be shattered, however, when Austria's desire to recapture Silesia intertwined with the [[Diplomatic Revolution|political upheaval in Europe]], culminating in the [[Seven Years' War]] (1756–1763).

==Background==
[[File:Europe 1740 en.png|thumb|left|Europe in the years after the [[Treaty of Vienna (1738)]], with the Habsburg Monarchy in gold]]

The immediate cause of the War of the Austrian Succession was the death in 1740 of the Holy Roman Emperor, [[Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles VI]], and the inheritance of Habsburg lands in Austria, Hungary, Croatia, the Netherlands, Bohemia and Italy (often collectively referred to as 'Austria').

When Charles succeeded his elder brother [[Joseph I, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph I]] in 1711, he was the last male Habsburg heir in the direct line; this meant their lands would be divided on his death as [[Salic law]] prevented women inheriting in their own right. A family issue became a European one due to tensions within the [[Holy Roman Empire]], whose monarch was officially chosen by seven [[prince-electors]]. The [[Thirty Years' War|Thirty Years' War of 1618-48]] divided the Empire into Protestant and Catholic regions, substantially weakening the bonds holding it together, while by the mid 18th-century states like Bavaria, Prussia and Saxony had increased dramatically in both size and power. The same was also true of the Habsburgs, who now viewed the title of Emperor as being hereditary in practice if not principle ([[Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor|Sigismund]] the last non-Habsburg Emperor ruled from 1410-1437.) These centrifugal forces led to a war that reshaped the traditional European balance of power; the various legal claims were largely pretexts and seen as such.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Anderson|first1=MS|title=The War of the Austrian Succession 1740-1748|date=1995|publisher=Routledge|isbn=058205950X|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Pragmatic Sanction of 1713|Pragmatic Sanction]] of 1713 secured the integrity of the Habsburg inheritance by allowing a female successor, a principle approved by the various Habsburg territories, [[Imperial Diet (Holy Roman Empire)|the Imperial Diet,]] Spain, Russia, Prussia, Britain and France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Anderson|first1=MS|title=The War of Austrian Succession 1740-1748|date=1995|publisher=Routledge|isbn=058205950X|pages=7–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, when his own daughter [[Maria Theresa]] was born in 1717, Charles had disinherited his two nieces [[Maria Josepha of Austria|Maria Josepha]] and [[Maria Amalia of Austria|Maria Amalia]], married respectively to the rulers of Saxony and Bavaria who now refused to be bound by the decision of the Imperial Diet. In addition, despite publicly agreeing to the Pragmatic Sanction in 1735, France then signed a secret treaty with Bavaria in 1738 promising to back the 'just claims' of [[Charles VII, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles Albert of Bavaria.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Black|first1=James|title=From Louis XIV to Napoleon: The Fate of a Great Power|date=1999|publisher=Routledge|isbn=185728934X|page=82}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Charles responded by supporting first the claim of [[Augustus III of Poland|Augustus, Elector of Saxony]] to the Polish throne in the [[War of the Polish Succession]], then more disastrously Russia in the [[Russo-Turkish War (1735–1739)|Russo-Turkish War of 1735–1739]]. The losses of men, money and territory in these two conflicts of low strategic value weakened Austria at exactly the wrong time, while Charles also failed to prepare Maria Theresa for her new role, excluding her from any role in government. Many diplomats and statesmen were sceptical Austria could survive the widely anticipated contest that would follow Charles' death, which finally occurred in October 1740.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Coxe|first1=William|title=History of the House of Austria|date=2010|publisher=Nabu Publishing|isbn=1148329471|page=242|edition=1847}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Strategies==

For much of the eighteenth century, France approached its wars in the same way: It would either let its colonies defend themselves, or would offer only minimal help (sending them only limited numbers of troops or inexperienced soldiers), anticipating that fights for the colonies would likely be lost anyway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pritchard|first=James|title=In Search of Empire: The French in the Americas, 1670–1730|year=2004|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=0-521-82742-6|pages=356|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kK9wa98I4eEC }}&lt;/ref&gt; This strategy was, to a degree, forced upon France: geography, coupled with the superiority of the British navy, made it difficult for the French navy to provide significant supplies and support to French colonies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dull|first=Jonathan R.|title=The French Navy and the Seven Years' War|year=2007|publisher=University of Nebraska Press|location=Lincoln NE|isbn=0-8032-1731-5|pages=14|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QcsnvXeOdW4C }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, several long land borders made an effective domestic army imperative for any ruler of France.&lt;ref name=borneman&gt;{{cite book|last=Borneman|first=Walter R.|title=The French and Indian War: Deciding the Fate of North America|year=2007|publisher=HarperCollins|location=New York|isbn=978-0-06-076184-4|pages=80|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=O7TZqbj_6BYC }}&lt;/ref&gt; Given these military necessities, the French government, unsurprisingly, based its strategy overwhelmingly on the army in Europe: it would keep most of its army on the European continent, hoping that such a force would be victorious closer to home.&lt;ref name=borneman /&gt; At the end of the War of Austrian Succession, France gave back its European conquests, while recovering such lost overseas possessions as [[Fortress of Louisbourg|Louisbourg]], largely restoring the ''status quo ante'' as far as France was concerned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lee|first=Stephen J.|title=Aspects of European History, 1494–1789|year=1984|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=0-416-37490-5|pages=285|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t9REWs8RAcYC }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The British—by inclination as well as for pragmatic reasons—had tended to avoid large-scale commitments of troops on the Continent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Till|first=Geoffrey|title=Development of British Naval Thinking: Essays in Memory of Bryan Ranft|year=2006|publisher=Routledge|location=Abingdon|isbn=0-714-65320-9|pages=77|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iIpFoGiz88IC }}&lt;/ref&gt; They sought to offset the disadvantage this created in Europe by allying themselves with one or more Continental powers whose interests were antithetical to those of their enemies, particularly France. In the War of the Austrian Succession, the British were allied with Austria; by the time of the [[Seven Years' War]], they were allied with its enemy, [[Prussia]]. In marked contrast to France, Britain strove to actively prosecute the war in the colonies once it became involved in the war, taking full advantage of its [[naval power]].&lt;ref name=black&gt;{{cite book|last=Black|first=Jeremy|title=Britain As A Military Power, 1688–1815 |year=1999|publisher=UCL Press|location=London|isbn=1-85728-772-X|pages=45–78|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=E5E2yDg4VekC&amp;pg=PA45 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The British pursued a dual strategy of [[naval blockade]] and bombardment of enemy ports, and also utilized their ability to move troops by sea to the utmost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Vego|first=Milan&amp;nbsp;N.|title=Naval Strategy and Operations in Narrow Seas|year=2003|publisher=Frank Cass|location=London|isbn=0-7146-5389-6|pages=156–157|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MXO5fx1cs5oC }}&lt;/ref&gt; They would harass enemy shipping and attack enemy outposts, frequently using colonists from nearby British colonies in the effort. This plan worked better in North America than in Europe, but set the stage for the Seven Years' War.

==Silesian Campaign of 1740==
{{further|First Silesian War}}
[[File:Maria Theresia of Austria 001.jpg|thumb|upright=.8|[[Maria Theresa]], Queen regnant of Hungary and Bohemia and Archduchess of Austria, Holy Roman Empress]]

Prussia in 1740 was an [[Power (international relations)|emerging power]], a small but well-organized state whose new king, [[Frederick II of Prussia|Frederick II]], wanted to unify the disparate and scattered holdings of his crown by gathering intervening lands into a unified, contiguous state. Prince Frederick was 28 years old when he ascended to the throne on 31 May 1740 upon the death of his father, [[Frederick William I of Prussia|Frederick William I]].&lt;ref name="Luvaas, p. 3"&gt;Luvaas, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Although Prussia and Austria had been allies in the [[War of the Polish Succession]] (1733–1738), concluded only two years before, the interests of the two countries diverged when the Holy Roman Emperor, Charles VI, died on 20 October 1740. Neither Frederick nor his father had ever been fond of Austria and its various snubs against Prussia (such as offering them the duchies of Julich and Berg in return for an alliance, only to renege later).&lt;ref name="Clark"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Iron Kingdom: The Rise and Downfall of Prussia, 1600–1947|first=Christopher|last=Clark|year=2006|publisher=[[Belknap Press]]|isbn=978-0-674-03196-8|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FGYsAAAAYAAJ|pages=191–192}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rejecting the Pragmatic Sanction of 1713, Frederick opportunistically invaded Silesia on 16 December 1740.&lt;ref&gt;Asprey, p. 164.&lt;/ref&gt; In support of his invasion, Frederick used a questionable interpretation of a treaty (1537) between the Hohenzollerns and the Piasts of Brieg as a pretext. What Frederick really feared was that other princes of Europe were preparing to exploit the succession struggle to acquire Habsburg possessions for themselves and/or diminish the power of the Holy Roman Empire. In particular, Frederick feared that [[Augustus III of Poland|Augustus III]], Elector of Saxony and King of Poland, was preparing to seize Silesia for himself to unite Saxony and Poland.&lt;ref&gt;Norman Davies, ''God's Playground: A History of Poland: Volume I: The Origins to 1795'' (Columbia University Press: New York, 1982) p. 507.&lt;/ref&gt;

The only recent combat experience of the Prussian Army was their participation in the [[War of the Polish Succession]] (''Rhine campaign of 1733–1735''), in which the Prussians had largely been kept out of combat. Nobody in the Habsburg court trusted the motives of the new rising power of Prussia and, therefore,{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} the Holy Roman Emperor did not call on the Prussians, who were vassals{{dubious|date=October 2015}} of the Holy Roman Empire, for military support of the Empire. Accordingly, the Prussian Army had an uninspiring reputation and was counted as one of the many minor armies of the Holy Roman Empire. This reputation misrepresented the fact of a standing army of 80,000 soldiers, representing 4% of the 2.2 million population of Prussia.&lt;ref&gt;Reed Browning, ''The War of Austrian Succession'' (St. Martin's Press: New York, 1993) p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus the Prussian Army was disproportionate to the size of the state it protected. By comparison, the Austrian Empire had 16 million citizens but had an army only half its authorised size because of financial restraints. Thus, in defending the vast territory of the Austrian Empire this small army was more of "a sieve"&lt;ref&gt;Reed Browning, ''The War of Austrian Succession'', p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; than a shield against foreign invasion.

[[File:Crown of Bohemia 1648.png|thumb|left|[[Lands of the Bohemian Crown]] until 1742 when most of [[Silesia]] was [[Treaty of Berlin (1742)|ceded]] to Prussia]]

Moreover, the Prussian army was better trained than other armies in Europe and was led by an excellent officer corps. King [[Frederick William I of Prussia|Frederick William I]] and "the guiding genius of the Prussian Army",&lt;ref&gt;Reed Browning, ''Frederick the Great: The Magnificent Enigma'', p. 697.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Leopold I, Prince of Anhalt-Dessau]] or "Old Dessauer", had drilled the Prussian Army to a perfection previously unknown in Europe; they were without rival in their discipline, precision and rate of fire. Furthermore, while the Austrians had to wait for conscription to complete the field forces, Prussian regiments took the field at once. With this army it might not have been surprising that Frederick was able to overrun Silesia. However, Frederick sought even more advantages in the war he was planning. Accordingly, he had his Foreign Minister—[[Heinrich von Podewils]]—secretly negotiate a treaty with France to put Austria in a two front war. In this way, Prussia could attack the Austrians in the east while France would attack Austria from the west. A treaty with France was signed in April 1739.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Asprey|first1=Robert|title=Frederick the Great; The Magnificent Enigma|date=2007|publisher=iUniverse|isbn=0595469000|page=129|edition=Revised 1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early December, Frederick assembled his army along the [[Oder]] river and on 16 December, without a formal declaration of war, the Prussians invaded Silesia. For most of the previous century, Austria's military resources had been concentrated in Hungary and Italy, countering threats from the Ottomans and Spanish respectively, while neglecting less vulnerable areas. As a result, the Austrians had fewer than 3,000 troops available to defend Silesia, and although this was increased to 7,000 shortly before the Prussian attack, they could only hold the fortresses of [[Glogau]], [[Breslau]], and [[Brzeg|Brieg]], abandoning the rest of the province and retreating into Moravia, at which point both sides went into winter quarters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Anderson|first1=Mark|title=The War of the Austrian Succession|date=1995|publisher=Routledge|isbn=058205950X|pages=68}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prussia now controlled most of the single richest province in the Habsburg Empire (Silesian taxes provided 10% of total Imperial income), with a population of over one million, the major commercial centre of Breslau and large mining, weaving and dyeing industries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Armour|first1=Ian|title=A History of Eastern Europe 1740-1918|date=2012|publisher=Bloomsbury Academic Press|isbn=1849664889|pages=99–101}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Frederick had hoped to avoid a long war by rapidly capturing all of Silesia, presenting Maria Theresa with a fait accompli, in exchange for which Prussia would guarantee the Habsburgs' other German territories; Austria's retention of its fortresses in Southern Silesia and the failure of Prussian diplomatic efforts to persuade powers like Britain and Russia to agree meant a quick victory could not be achieved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Anderson|first1=Mark|title=The War of the Austrian Succession|date=1995|publisher=Routledge|isbn=058205950X|pages=69–72}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Allies in Bohemia 1741==
[[File:Crown prince Friedrich II, by Antoine Pesne.jpg|thumb|Frederick II of Prussia]]
Early in the year, a new Austrian field army under General [[Wilhelm Reinhard von Neipperg]] relieved Neisse and marched on Brieg, threatening to cut the Prussians off. On 10 April, Frederick's army caught the Austrians on the snow-covered fields near Mollwitz.&lt;ref&gt;Jay Luvaas, ''Frederick the Great on the Art of War'' p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; This was the first time that Frederick had led troops into battle.&lt;ref name="Jay Luvaas p. 4"&gt;Jay Luvaas, ''Frederick the Great on the Art of War'', p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; The victory that Frederick attained at the [[Battle of Mollwitz]] was a learning experience for the young King, who departed from the field just before his troops routed the Austrians; both his tactics and his cavalry were rather clumsy, and victory was only obtained due to the discipline of the Prussian infantry and their veteran commander, Field Marshall Kurt von Schwerin.&lt;ref&gt;Luvaas, p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt;

Frederick obtained an alliance with the French against the Austrians, signing the Treaty of Breslau on 5 June.&lt;ref name="Robert B. Asprey p. 181"&gt;Asprey, p. 181.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jeremy Black p. 13"&gt;Jeremy Black, ''America or Europe? British Foreign Policy, 1739–63'', p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, the French began to cross the Rhine on 15 August&lt;ref name="Jeremy Black p. 13"/&gt; and joined the Bavarian Elector's forces on the [[Danube]] and advanced towards [[Vienna]].&lt;ref name="Robert B. Asprey p. 223"&gt;Asprey, p. 223.&lt;/ref&gt; The combined forces of the French and the Bavarians captured the Austrian town of Linz on 14 September.&lt;ref name="Jeremy Black p. 13"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Robert B. Asprey p. 223"/&gt; However, at this point, the objective was suddenly changed, and after many countermarches the anti-Austrian allies advanced, in three widely separated [[corps]], on [[Prague]]. A French corps moved via [[Amberg]] and [[Plzeň|Pilsen]]. The Elector marched on [[Budweis]], and the Saxons (who had now joined the allies against Austria&lt;ref name="Robert B. Asprey p. 223"/&gt;) invaded [[Bohemia]] by the [[Elbe]] valley. The Austrians could at first offer little resistance, but before long a considerable force intervened at [[Tábor]] between the Danube and the allies, and Austrian troops including Neipperg were soon transferred from Silesia back to the west to defend the Austrian capital, Vienna, from the French.

With fewer Austrian troops in Silesia Frederick now had an easier time. The remaining fortresses in Silesia were taken by the Prussians.&lt;ref name="Robert B. Asprey p. 181"/&gt; Before he left Silesia, Austrian General Neipperg had made a curious agreement with Frederick, the so-called Klein–Schnellendorf agreement (9 October 1741). By this agreement, the fortress at Neisse was surrendered after a mock siege, and the Prussians agreed to let the Austrians leave unmolested releasing Neipperg's army for service elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;Asprey, pp. 223–224.&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time the [[Hungary|Hungarians]], moved to enthusiasm by the personal appeal, in September 1741, of Maria Theresia,&lt;ref&gt;J. Alexander Mahan,''Maria Theresa of Austria'' (Thomas Y. Crowell Pub.: New York, 1932) p. 117.&lt;/ref&gt; had put into the field a ''levée en masse,'' or "insurrection," which furnished the regular army with an invaluable force of 60,000 more light troops.&lt;ref name="Asprey-p290"&gt;Asprey, p. 290.&lt;/ref&gt; A fresh army was collected under Field Marshal [[Ludwig Andreas von Khevenhüller|Khevenhüller]] at Vienna, and the Austrians planned an offensive winter campaign against the Franco-Bavarian forces in Bohemia and the small Bavarian army that remained on the Danube to defend the electorate.

Meanwhile, the Saxon-born Maurice de Saxe and a small French force stormed Prague on 26 November 1741. [[Francis I, Holy Roman Emperor|Francis Stephen]], husband of Maria Theresa, who commanded the Austrians in Bohemia, moved too slowly to save the fortress. The Elector of Bavaria, who now styled himself [[Archduke of Austria]], was crowned King of Bohemia (9 December 1741) and elected to the imperial throne as [[Charles VII, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles VII]] (24 January 1742), but no active measures were undertaken.

In Bohemia the month of December was occupied in mere skirmishes. On the Danube, Khevenhüller, the best general in the Austrian service, advanced on 27 December, swiftly drove back the allies, shut them up in [[Linz]], and pressed on into Bavaria.&lt;ref&gt;Asprey, pp. 228–229.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Munich]] itself surrendered to the Austrians on the [[coronation]] day of Charles VII.

At the close of this first act of the campaign the French, under the old Marshal [[François-Marie, 1st duc de Broglie|de Broglie]], maintained a precarious foothold in central Bohemia, menaced by the main army of the Austrians, and Khevenhüller was ranging unopposed in Bavaria. Frederick made a secret truce with Austria and thus, lay inactive in Silesia.

==Campaigns of 1742==
[[File:20131020142107!Martin van Meytens 007.jpg|thumb|[[Prince Charles Alexander of Lorraine]]]]
Frederick had hoped by the truce to secure Silesia, for which alone he was fighting; although allied with the French, he had no wish to see them become the dominant power in Germany through the destruction of Austria. For their part, the French had aspirations to divide most of the Habsburg territories between themselves, Prussia, Bavaria and Saxony. But with the successes of Khevenhüller and the enthusiastic "insurrection" of Hungary, Maria Theresa's opposition became firmer, and she divulged the provisions of the [[Armistice|truce]], to compromise Frederick with his allies. The war recommenced. Frederick had not rested idle on his laurels. In the uneventful summer campaign of 1741 he had found time to begin the reorganisation of his cavalry. The training of the Prussian cavalry had been neglected by Frederick's father—King Frederick William I.&lt;ref name="Asprey-p208"&gt;Asprey, p. 208.&lt;/ref&gt; Probably because he himself was an infantryman to his core, the training of the cavalry had also been overlooked by the "[[Leopold I, Prince of Anhalt-Dessau|Old Dessauer]]" who was the true genius behind the Prussian Army.&lt;ref name="Asprey-p208" /&gt; Frederick had been disappointed by the performance of his cavalry at the Battle of Mollwitz.&lt;ref&gt;Asprey, pp. 202–203.&lt;/ref&gt; However, as a result of Frederick's training over the summer of 1741 the Prussian cavalry would soon acquit themselves much better in the coming battles of the First Silesian War.

The Bavarian Emperor Charles VII, whose territories were overrun by the Austrians, asked him to create a diversion by invading Moravia. In December 1741, therefore, the Prussian general field marshal [[Kurt Christoph Graf von Schwerin]] crossed the border and captured [[Olmutz]]. [[Kłodzko|Glatz]] also was [[Siege|invested]], and the Prussian army was concentrated about Olmutz in January 1742. A combined [[Military strategy|plan of operations]] was made by the French, Saxons and Prussians for the rescue of Linz. But Linz soon fell. Broglie on the [[Vltava]], weakened by the departure of the Bavarians to oppose Khevenhüller, and of the Saxons to join forces with Frederick, was in no condition to take the offensive, and large forces under [[Prince Charles Alexander of Lorraine|Prince Charles of Lorraine]] lay in his front from [[Budweis]] to [[Jihlava]] (Iglau). Frederick's march was made towards Iglau in the first place. [[Brno]] was invested about the same time (February), but the direction of the march was changed, and instead of moving against Prince Charles, Frederick pushed on southwards by [[Znojmo]] and [[Mikulov]]. The extreme outposts of the Prussians appeared before Vienna. But Frederick's advance was a mere foray, and Prince Charles, leaving a screen of troops in front of Broglie, marched to cut off the Prussians from Silesia, while the Hungarian [[Conscription|levies]] poured into [[Upper Silesia]] by the [[Jablunkov Pass]]. The Saxons, discontented and demoralised, soon marched off to their own country, and Frederick with his Prussians fell back by [[Svitavy]] and [[Litomyšl]] to [[Kutná Hora]] in Bohemia, where he was in touch with Broglie on the one hand and (Glatz having now surrendered) with Silesia on the other. No defence of Olmutz was attempted, and the small Prussian corps remaining in Moravia fell back towards Upper Silesia.

Prince Charles marched past Jihlava and Teutsch (Deutsch) Brod on Kutná Hora in pursuit of Frederick. On 17 May 1742 Frederick turned around and faced the Austrian forces that were pursuing him.&lt;ref&gt;Asprey, pp. 249–258.&lt;/ref&gt; He fought the Austrians in what has become known as the [[Battle of Chotusitz]]. After a severe struggle Frederick won a major Prussian victory. At Chotusitz, it was Frederick's newly reorganised and trained cavalry that really won the victory&lt;ref&gt;Luvaas, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; and compensated for their previous failings. The cavalry's conduct gave an earnest prospect of its future glory, not only by its [[Charge (warfare)|charges]] on the battlefield, but by its vigorous pursuit of the defeated Austrians.

Almost at the same time the Battle of Chotusitz was occurring, French Field Marshal [[François Marie de Broglie|François Broglie]] fell upon a part of the Austrians left on the Vltava and won a small, but morally and politically important, success in the action of [[Zahájí (České Budějovice District)|Sahay]], near Budweis (24 May 1742). Frederick did not propose another combined movement. Frederick's victory at Chotusitz, along with the victory of Field Marshal Broglie, persuaded Maria Theresa to seek peace even if it meant ceding away Silesia to make good her position elsewhere.&lt;ref name="Jay Luvaas p. 4"/&gt; Accordingly, a separate peace between Prussia and Austria was signed at [[Wrocław|Breslau]] on 11 June 1742, which drew the '''First Silesian War''' to a close.&lt;ref&gt;Asprey, p. 262.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the larger War of the Austrian Succession continued.

==Campaign of 1743==
The year 1743 opened disastrously for the forces of the new Holy Roman Emperor, [[Charles VII, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles VII]]. The French and Bavarian armies were not working well together, and Field Marshal Broglie had been placed in command of the allied army in Bavaria.&lt;ref&gt;Asprey, p. 274.&lt;/ref&gt; This created tension between Broglie and the Bavarian commanders. Broglie openly quarrelled with the Bavarian field marshal [[Friedrich Heinrich von Seckendorff]]. No connected resistance was offered to the converging march of Prince Charles's army along the Danube, Khevenhüller from Salzburg towards southern Bavaria, and Prince Lobkowitz from Bohemia towards the [[Naab]]. The Bavarians, under the command of Count Minuzzi, suffered a severe reverse at the town of [[Simbach, Dingolfing-Landau|Simbach]] near [[Braunau am Inn|Braunau]] on 9 May 1743 at the hands of Prince Charles of Lorraine.&lt;ref&gt;Reed Browning, ''The War of the Austrian Succession'', p. 136.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:George II of Great Britain-01.jpg|thumb|left|[[George II of Great Britain]]]]

Now an Anglo-Allied army commanded by King [[George II of Great Britain|George II]] retreated down the [[Main River]] to the village of [[Hanau]].&lt;ref&gt;Reed Browning, ''The War of the Austrian Succession'', p. 137.&lt;/ref&gt; This army had been formed on the lower Rhine upon the withdrawal of the French (Westphalian) Army under the command of the [[Jean-Baptiste François des Marets, marquis de Maillebois|Marquis de Maillebois]]. This allied army became known as the "Pragmatic Army," because it was drawn from a confederation of states that supported the [[Pragmatic Sanction of 1713]], which made [[Maria Theresa]] sole heir of the Habsburg territories. The Pragmatic Army had been advancing southward up the [[Main (river)|Main]] into [[Neckar]] country prior to this retreat in the summer of 1743. A French army, under Marshal [[Adrien Maurice, duc de Noailles|Noailles]], was being collected on the middle Rhine to deal with this new force. Marshal Noailles correctly anticipated that given the problems faced by the Pragmatic Army, George II would take the entire Pragmatic Army back down the Main.&lt;ref&gt;Reed Browning, ''The War of Austrian Succession'', p. 138.&lt;/ref&gt; Marshal Noailles made plans to lay a trap for the Pragmatic Army and destroy it. However, Marshal Noailles's ally Marshal Broglie was now in full retreat. Strong places of Bavaria were surrendered one after the other to Prince Charles. Marshal Noailles's French army, however, was still intent on finding victory while Marshal de Broglie's Franco-Bavarian army was retreating towards France. In the [[Battle of Dettingen|Dettingen]], Noailles attempted a daring maneuver to envelop the British army but his subordinate the Duke de Gramont, without orders, attacked the Pragmatic Army and was defeated with heavy casualties.&lt;ref&gt;Reed Browning, ''The War of the Austrian Succession'', p. 139.&lt;/ref&gt;

King Frederick of Prussia was terrified by the defeat at Dettingen.&lt;ref name="Robert B. Asprey p. 275"&gt;Asprey, p. 275.&lt;/ref&gt; Frederick saw that he now faced a coalition of potential rivals that included Austria, Britain and Russia.&lt;ref name="Robert B. Asprey p. 275"/&gt; However, Frederick soon realised that the coalition against him was not as strong as it first appeared. Neither Austria nor the British knew how to exploit their victory at Dettingen.&lt;ref name="Robert B. Asprey p. 275"/&gt; Marshal Noailles was driven almost to the Rhine by King George. The French and Bavarian army had been completely outmanoeuvred and was in a position of the greatest danger between [[Aschaffenburg]] and [[Hanau]] in the [[defile (geography)|defile]] formed by the [[Spessart]] Hills and the river Main. Yet the Pragmatic Army did not quickly follow up the attack. Thus, Marshal Noailles had time to block the outlet and had posts all around. At this point, the allied troops had to force their way through the French and Bavarian lines. Still, because of the heavy losses inflicted on the French, the Battle of Dettingen and the follow up is justly reckoned as a notable victory of Anglo-Austrian-Hanoverian arms.

The coalition against Frederick was suddenly weakened when the St. Petersburg court discovered a plot to overthrow [[Elizabeth of Russia|Tsarina Elisabeth]] and bring back the child [[Ivan VI]] as Tsar, with his mother [[Grand Duchess Anna Leopoldovna of Russia|Grand Duchess Anna Leopoldovna]] serving as regent for the child.&lt;ref name="Robert B. Asprey p. 275"/&gt; Matters were made much worse for the allies against Frederick when an Austrian envoy [[Antoniotto Botta Adorno]] was found to be intimately involved in the plot. Indeed, the plot became known as the "Botta Conspiracy."&lt;ref&gt;W. Bruce Lincoln, ''The Romanovs: Autocrats of All the Russias'' (The Dial Press: New York, 1981) p. 197.&lt;/ref&gt; The Botta-attempted coup redounded badly not only against Austria, but also against the Saxon and British courts.&lt;ref name="Robert B. Asprey p. 275"/&gt; Frederick's initial indifference to a treaty with Russia now changed to enthusiasm in the light of the fallout from the Botta Conspiracy.&lt;ref&gt;Robert B. Asprey, Frederick the Great: The Magnificent Enigma'', p. 275.&lt;/ref&gt;

Marshal Broglie, worn out by age and exertions, was soon replaced by Marshal [[François de Franquetot, Duc de Coigny|Coigny]].&lt;ref&gt;Asprey, pp. 279–280.&lt;/ref&gt; Both Broglie and Noailles were now on the strict defensive behind the Rhine. Not a single French soldier remained in Germany, and Prince Charles prepared to force the passage of the Rhine river in the [[Breisgau]] while George II, King of Britain, moved forward via [[Mainz]] to co-operate by drawing upon himself the attention of both the French marshals. The Anglo-allied army took [[Worms, Germany|Worms]], but after several unsuccessful attempts to cross the Rhine river, Prince Charles went into winter quarters. The king followed his example, drawing his troops to the north, to deal, if necessary, with the army which the French were collecting on the frontier of the [[Southern Netherlands]]. Austria, Britain, the Dutch Republic and Sardinia were now allied. Saxony changed sides and the entry of Sweden had offset the loss of Russia to the allies. Thus, Sweden and Russia neutralised each other ([[Peace of Åbo]], August 1743). Frederick was still quiescent. France, Spain and Bavaria actively continued the struggle against Maria Theresa.

While the Battle of Dettingen and Russian Botta plot were capturing all the attention during the summer of 1743, negotiations between the British, the Austrians and Sardinians were proceeding quietly in the city of [[Worms, Germany|Worms]].&lt;ref&gt;Reed Browning, ''The War of the Austrian Succession'', p. 142.&lt;/ref&gt; The Austrians were desperately afraid that Frederick II would soon be invading the Austrian domains again. Thus, the Austrians sought a separate peace with Sardinia in Italy. Under the terms of the [[Treaty of Worms (1743)|Treaty of Worms]], which was signed on 13 September 1743, the Austrian Habsburgs surrendered all territory in Italy located west of the [[Ticino River]] and [[Lake Maggiore]] to Sardinia.&lt;ref&gt;Reed Browning, ''The War of the Austrian Succession'' p. 147.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally some lands south of the Po River were also given to Sardinia.&lt;ref&gt;Reed Browning, ''The War of Austrian Succession'', pp. 146–147.&lt;/ref&gt; In exchange, Sardinia renounced its claim to Milan, guaranteed the Pragmatic Sanction and agreed to provide 40,000 troops for a joint Italian army to fight the Bourbons.

==Campaign of 1744==
{{Further|Second Silesian War}}
[[File:Louis XV ;Carle van Loo.jpg|thumb|[[Louis XV of France]] by [[Maurice Quentin de La Tour]] (1748), pastel painting]]

The [[Second Silesian War]] began in 1744. Frederick of Prussia was disquieted by the universal success of the Austrians and their alliance with Sardinia. Accordingly, he secretly concluded another alliance with [[Louis XV of France]].&lt;ref&gt;Asprey, p. 279.&lt;/ref&gt; France had posed hitherto as an auxiliary – its officers in Germany had worn the Bavarian [[cockade]] – and was officially at war only with Britain. France now declared war directly upon Austria and Sardinia (April 1744).

At this point, the French planned a diversion that they hoped would cause Britain to leave the war. A French army was assembled at [[Dunkirk]] to support the cause of [[Charles Edward Stuart]] (Bonnie Prince Charlie) in [[Planned French invasion of Britain (1744)|an invasion of Great Britain]]. Prince Charles was son of [[James Francis Edward Stuart]], Stuart pretender to the British throne, who was the son of [[James II of England|James II]] the last Catholic and last Stuart king of England. James II had been deposed as the King of England in 1688 in favour of his daughter, Mary, and her husband the Protestant Prince of Orange, [[William III of England|William III]] of the house of Orange-Nassau. A significant element of the British population still hoped for the return of the Stuart family as monarchs. King [[Louis XIV of France]] had shown great support for Stuart cause. Indeed, in 1715, France had sponsored an uprising in Scotland, which the pretender James had joined, but it was defeated. Forbidden to return to France by the new king, Louis XV, James sought sanctuary elsewhere. Finally, [[Pope Clement XI]] offered James and his family the use of [[Palazzo Muti]] and a lifetime annuity of 8,000 Roman [[scudi]]. Charles Edward Stuart was born and lived his whole life in the Palazzo Muti.

Charles had much more charisma than his father, and now Louis XV was favourably disposed toward helping him create another uprising in Scotland. Louis XV sent Drummond of Balhaldy as an emissary to the Stuart "court" in Rome.&lt;ref&gt;Moray McLaren, ''Bonnie Prince Charlie'' (Dorset Press: New York, 1972) p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt; French plans called for Charles to be in Dunkirk, France, to assemble with the fleet on 10 January 1744, yet Balhaldy had only arrived in Rome on 19 December 1743.&lt;ref&gt;Moray McLaren, ''Bonnie Prince Charlie'', p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus there was very little time to waste. On 23 December 1743, Charles' father named him "[[Prince regent|Prince Regent]]" so that Charles could act in his own name. In the spring of 1744, Prince Charles secretly arrived in France and was about to board the ships that would take him to England. However, on the night before he was to board, a fierce storm blew up (this storm became known as the "Protestant Wind") and wrecked or dispersed the entire fleet.&lt;ref&gt;Moray McLaren, ''Bonnie Prince Charlie'', p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; The violent storms had wrecked the crossing attempt, and the planned invasion was abandoned. However, Charles did not give up hope of restoring the Stuart family to the throne of England.

During naval operations that were possible preparations for a coordinated French invasion of England, the largest sea battle of the war occurred, on 22 February 1744.&lt;ref name="Browning-p155"&gt;Reed Browning, ''The War of the Austrian Succession'', p. 155.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Battle of Toulon (1744)|This naval battle]] took place in the Mediterranean off the coast of [[Toulon]], France. A large British fleet under the command of Admiral [[Thomas Mathews]], with Rear Admiral [[Richard Lestock]] second in command, was blockading the French coast. A smaller French and Spanish naval force attacked the British blockade and damaged some of the British ships, forcing the British to withdraw and seek repairs. Thus, the British blockade of the French coast was relieved, and the Spanish fleet apparently controlled the Mediterranean Sea. A Spanish squadron took refuge in the harbour at Toulon. The British fleet watched this squadron carefully from a harbour a short distance to the east. On 21 February 1744, the Spanish ships put to sea with a French fleet. Admiral Mathews took his British fleet and attacked the Spanish fleet from 22 February until 23 February 1744 in what has become known as the Battle of Toulon. However, because of miscommunication and possibly treachery on the part of Rear Admiral Lestock, the smaller Spanish fleet was allowed to escape. With the knowledge that a larger French fleet was sailing to the rescue the British ships broke off combat and retreated to the northeast.

Although technically the Battle of Toulon was regarded as a victory for Britain,&lt;ref&gt;Rhea Marsh Smith, ''Spain: A Modern History, p. 243&lt;/ref&gt; in Britain the public feared that the combined French and Spanish ships were making for the [[Strait of Gibraltar]] and for a gathering of ships at [[Brest, France|Brest]] for a [[Planned French invasion of Britain (1744)|planned invasion of England]].&lt;ref name="Smith-p243"&gt;Rhea Marsh Smith, ''Spain: A Modern History'', p. 243.&lt;/ref&gt; As a consequence, bitter recriminations were brought against Admiral Mathews for letting this Spanish-French fleet get away and, subsequently, placing England in danger of invasion. Consequently, both Mathews and Lestock were tried in naval court. Lestock was acquitted (unjustly according to some), while Mathews was found guilty (also regarded as an injustice by some commentators).&lt;ref name="Browning-p155" /&gt;

[[File:OHM - Bayrischer Krieg 1.jpg|thumb|Warfare between Deggendorf and Vilshofen, Bavaria]]

Meanwhile, on the battlefields in northern Europe, Louis XV in person, with 90,000 men, invaded the [[Austrian Netherlands]]&lt;ref&gt;Asprey, p. 280.&lt;/ref&gt; and took [[Menen|Menin]] and [[Ypres]] in July 1744.&lt;ref&gt;Reed Browning, ''The War of the Austrian Succession'', p. 171.&lt;/ref&gt; His presumed opponent, although shorn of the Russians, still consisted of the same allied army, previously commanded by King George II, and composed of British, Dutch, German (Hanoverian) and Austrian troops.

The French put four armies into the field.&lt;ref name="Browning-p172"&gt;Reed Browning, ''The War of the Austrian Succession'', p. 172.&lt;/ref&gt; On the Rhine, Marshal Coigny had 57,000 troops up against 70,000 allied troops under the command of Prince Charles.&lt;ref&gt;Reed Browning, ''The War of Austrian Succession'', pp. 172, 174.&lt;/ref&gt; A fresh army of over 30,000 soldiers under the [[Louis François I de Bourbon, prince de Conti|Prince de Conti]] was located between the [[Meuse]] and [[Moselle]] rivers, which would later assist the Spaniards in Piedmont and Lombardy.&lt;ref name="Browning-p172" /&gt; This plan was, however, at once dislocated by the advance of Prince Charles, who, assisted by the veteran Marshal [[Otto Ferdinand von Abensberg und Traun|Traun]], skillfully manoeuvred his allied army over the Rhine near [[Philippsburg]] on 1 July 1744 and captured the [[lines of Weissenburg]], and cut off Marshal Coigny and his army from [[Alsace]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Thomas Carlyle|Carlyle, Thomas]], ''[[History of Friedrich II of Prussia]] V: {{cite web |url=http://infomotions.com/etexts/gutenberg/dirs/etext00/15frd10.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-08-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090112065746/http://infomotions.com/etexts/gutenberg/dirs/etext00/15frd10.htm |archivedate=12 January 2009 |df=dmy-all }} Book XV Second Silesian War, Important Episode in the General European one. 15 August 1744 – 25 December 1745.]'' Chapter 1: Section: Prince Charles gets across the Rhine (20 June – 2 July 1744). ([[Project Gutenberg]])&lt;/ref&gt;

A third French Army composed of 17,000 men under the command of [[François-Henri d'Harcourt|Duke d' Harcourt]] kept Luxembourg at bay&lt;ref name="Browning-p172" /&gt; Meanwhile, the fourth French army was the largest army that put to field in the summer of 1744. This was the Army of Flanders, numbering 87,000 men and officially under the command of the king of France, Louis XV, but in actuality he was being militarily advised by Marshal Noailles.&lt;ref&gt;Reed Browning, ''The War of Austrian Succession, p. 172.&lt;/ref&gt; As these French forces invaded the [[Austrian Netherlands]], they outnumbered the allied armies by about a four to three ratio.&lt;ref name="Browning-p174"&gt;Reed Browning, ''The War of the Austrian Succession'', p. 174.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, as they marched into the Austrian Netherlands, they met a confused resistance offered by Dutch forces.&lt;ref&gt;Reed Browning, ''The War of the Austrian Succession'', p. 173.&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, the French Army of Flanders made rapid progress across the Austrian Netherlands.&lt;ref name="Browning-p174" /&gt; The situation became so desperate for the Dutch that the Dutch government sent an envoy to the king of France to seek peace. This plea for peace was rejected by the French.&lt;ref name="Browning-p174" /&gt;

However, the situation in the Austrian Netherlands was changed abruptly by the successful crossing of the Rhine on 30 June 1744 by Prince Charles and his 70,000-man allied army.&lt;ref name="Browning-p174" /&gt; Marshal Coigny, caught far in advance of the other French forces, cut his way back through the enemy at [[Wissembourg|Weissenburg]] and withdrew towards [[Strasbourg]].&lt;ref name="Browning-p175"&gt;Reed Browning, ''The War of the Austrian Succession'', p. 175.&lt;/ref&gt; Louis XV now abandoned the invasion of the [[Southern Netherlands]], and his army moved down to take a decisive part in the war in Alsace and [[Lorraine (province)|Lorraine]].

[[File:OHM - Bayrischer Krieg 2.jpg|thumb|Military camp: war of the Austrian succession]]

Finally, on 12 July 1744, Frederick II of Prussia received confirmation that Prince Charles had taken his army beyond the Rhine and into France.&lt;ref name="Browning-p175" /&gt; Thus, Frederick knew that Prince Charles would not be able to present any immediate problem to him in the east. Consequently, on 15 August 1744, Frederick II crossed the Austrian frontier into Bohemia, and by late August all 80,000 of his troops were in Bohemia.&lt;ref&gt;Robert B. Asprey, ''Frederick the Great: The Magnificent Enigma'', p. 289.&lt;/ref&gt; The attention and resources of Austria had been fully occupied for some time on a renewal of the war in Silesia. However, neither Maria Theresa nor her advisers had expected the Prussians to march as quickly as they did.&lt;ref name="Asprey-p290" /&gt; Accordingly, Frederick's invasion of Bohemia came as a surprise to the Austrian court and Frederick was almost unopposed in Bohemia. One column consisting of 40,000 troops, under Frederick's own command, passed through Saxony; another column of 16,000 men under the command of "[[Leopold II, Prince of Anhalt-Dessau|Young Dessauer]]" passed through [[Lusatia]], while a third consisting of 16,000 soldiers under Count Schwerin advanced from Silesia.&lt;ref name="Browning-p181"&gt;Reed Browning, ''The War of the Austrian Succession'', p. 181.&lt;/ref&gt; The destination for all three columns was Prague, and the objective was reached on 2 September. The city was surrounded and besieged. Six days later the Austrian garrison was compelled to surrender.&lt;ref name="Jay Luvaas p. 4" /&gt; Scarcely had Prague surrendered to Frederick II than he was off marching southwards, leaving 5,000 soldiers under General Baron [[Gottfried Emanual von Einsiedel]] to garrison Prague.&lt;ref&gt;Asprey, p. 293.&lt;/ref&gt; Three days after the fall of Prague, Frederick seized [[Tábor|Tabor]], [[Budweis]] and [[Hluboká nad Vltavou|Frauenberg]].&lt;ref&gt;Asprey, pp. 293, 294.&lt;/ref&gt;

Maria Theresa once again rose to the emergency: a new "insurrection" took the field in Hungary, and a corps of regulars was assembled to cover Vienna. Meanwhile, Austrian diplomats won over Saxony to the Austrian side.&lt;ref&gt;Reed Browning, ''The War of the Austrian Succession'', p. 182.&lt;/ref&gt; Because of Frederick's successful campaign in Bohemia, Prince Charles sought to withdraw from Alsace and cross the Rhine once again and strike at the Prussians. At this point the French had an excellent chance to strike at Prince Charles while he was in a vulnerable position, crossing the Rhine. However, the French military command was distracted and could not take any action, and Prince Charles was able to cross the Rhine once again unmolested by the French. The French had been unable to act because they were thrown into confusion by King Louis XV suddenly becoming very ill with smallpox at [[Metz]].&lt;ref name="Browning-p181" /&gt; The King's condition was so severe that many feared for his life. Only [[Friedrich Heinrich von Seckendorff|Count Seckendorf]], commander of the Bavarians, pursued Prince Charles. No move was made by the French, and Frederick thus found himself isolated and exposed to the combined attack of the Austrians and Saxons. Count Traun, summoned from the Rhine, held the king in check in Bohemia with a united force of Austrians and Saxons. The Hungarian irregulars also inflicted numerous minor reverses on the Prussians. Finally Prince Charles arrived with the main army from the west. The campaign resembled that of 1742: the Prussian retreat was closely watched, and the rearguard pressed hard. Prague fell, and Frederick was completely outmanoeuvred by the united forces of Prince Charles and Count Traun.&lt;ref&gt;Reed Browning, ''The War of Austrian Succession'', p. 183.&lt;/ref&gt; Frederick was forced to retreat to Silesia with heavy losses. However, the Austrians gained no foothold in Silesia itself. On the Rhine, Louis XV, now recovered, had besieged and taken [[Freiburg]],&lt;ref name="Browning-p196"&gt;Reed Browning, ''The War of the Austrian Succession'', p. 196.&lt;/ref&gt; after which the forces left in the north were reinforced and besieged the strong places of Southern Netherlands. There was also a slight war of manoeuvre on the middle Rhine.

==Campaign of 1745==
[[File:Hohenfriedeberg - Attack of Prussian Infantry - 1745.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|Attack of the Prussian Infantry at the [[Battle of Hohenfriedberg]], by [[Carl Röchling]]]]

In 1745 three of the greatest battles of the war occurred: [[Battle of Hohenfriedberg|Hohenfriedberg]], [[Battle of Kesselsdorf|Kesselsdorf]] and [[Battle of Fontenoy|Fontenoy]]. The formation of the [[Quadruple Alliance (1745)|Quadruple Alliance]] of Britain, Austria, the Dutch Republic and Saxony was concluded at [[Warsaw]] on 8 January 1745 by the [[Treaty of Warsaw (1745)|Treaty of Warsaw]].&lt;ref&gt;Reed Browning, ''The War of the Austrian Succession'', p. 195.&lt;/ref&gt; Twelve days later on 20 January 1745, the death of the Holy Roman Emperor, [[Charles VII, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles VII]], submitted the imperial title to a new election.&lt;ref name="Browning-p196" /&gt; Charles VII's son and heir, [[Maximilian III Joseph, Elector of Bavaria|Maximilian III]] of Bavaria, was not even considered a candidate for the Imperial throne. The Bavarian army was again unfortunate. Caught in its scattered winter quarters (action of Amberg, 7 January), it was driven from point to point by a maneuver by the Austrian army under the joint command of [[Károly József Batthyány|Count Batthyány]], Baron Bernklau and [[Maximilian Ulysses Browne|Count Browne]]. All Bavarian garrisons fled to the east. The Bavarian Army under the command of [[Count Törring]] was divided and paralyzed.&lt;ref name="Browning-p203"&gt;Reed Browning, ''The War of the Austrian Succession'', p. 203.&lt;/ref&gt; The French in the area under [[Henri François, comte de Ségur|Count Ségur]] marched to save the day. Count Sègur's force out-numbered the Austrian army under Count Batthyany, yet Sègur and the French army were defeated at the [[Battle of Pfaffenhofen]].&lt;ref name="Browning-p203" /&gt; The young elector Maximilian III had to abandon Munich once more. The [[Treaty of Füssen|Peace of Füssen]] followed on 22 April 1745, by which Maximilian III secured his hereditary states on condition of supporting the candidature of the Grand-Duke Francis, consort of Maria Theresa. The "imperial" army ceased ''ipso facto'' to exist.

[[File:Battle of Fontenoy 03.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|left|''The Battle of Fontenoy'' between the French and the British, by [[Blarenberghe|Louis-Nicolas van Blarenberghe]]]]

Frederick II of Prussia was again isolated. No help was to be expected from France, whose efforts at the time were centred on the Flanders campaign. Indeed, on 31 March 1745, before Frederick took the field, Louis XV and the Marshal of France [[Maurice de Saxe]], commanding an army of 95,000 men, the largest force in the war, had marched down the [[Scheldt]] valley and besieged [[Tournai|Tournay]].&lt;ref&gt;Reed Browning, ''The War of the Austrian Succession'', p. 206.&lt;/ref&gt; Tournay was defended by a Dutch garrison of 7,000 soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;Reed Browning, ''The War of the Austrian Succession'', p. 207.&lt;/ref&gt; In May 1745, a British army under the command of the [[William Augustus, Duke of Cumberland|Duke of Cumberland]] attempted to break the French siege and relieve Tournay. Maurice (who had just recently been appointed a Marshal in the French army) had very good intelligence and knew the road that Cumberland was using to attack his forces besieging forces. Thus, Maurice could select the battlefield. Maurice chose to attack the British allied army on a plain on the east side of the Scheldt river about two miles southeast of Tournay near the town of [[Antoing|Fontenoy]].&lt;ref&gt;Reed Browning, ''The War of the Austrian Succession'', p. 208.&lt;/ref&gt; There the Battle of Fontenoy was fought on 11 May 1745. Fighting began at 5:00 AM with a French artillery barrage of the British-Allied forces, who were still attempting to move into their proper positions for their anticipated attack on Tournay. By noon, Cumberland's troops had ground to a halt and discipline had begun to dissolve. The British-Allied army sought cover in a retreat.&lt;ref&gt;Reed Browning, ''The War of the Austrian Succession'', p. 212.&lt;/ref&gt; It was a victory for the French that captured the attention of Europe because it overturned the mystique of British military superiority, and it pointed out the importance of artillery.&lt;ref&gt;Reed Browning, ''The War of the Austrian Succession'', pp. 212–213.&lt;/ref&gt; On 20 June 1745, after the Battle on Fontenoy, the fortress of Tournay surrendered to the French.&lt;ref&gt;Reed Browning, ''The War of the Austrian Succession'', p. 219.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:MarechalMauricedeSaxedeLaTour.jpg|thumb|Marshal General [[Maurice de Saxe]]]]

In the summer of 1745, the French once more decided to take up Charles Edward Stuart's claim to the British throne. The goal was to start a revolt in Scotland that would divert British attention away from the war on the mainland in Europe, and may even require Britain to leave the war altogether. On 23 July 1745, Charles landed on the island of [[Eriskay]] in the Hebrides, north-west of the mainland of Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;Moray McLaren, ''Bonnie Prince Charlie'', p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt; On 25 July 1745, Charles set sail again for the mainland. By the end of August 1745, Charles had landed in Scotland and had started issuing calls for troops loyal to the [[Jacobitism|Jacobite]] cause of placing him on the throne.&lt;ref name="Browning-p240"&gt;Reed Browning, ''The War of the Austrian Succession'', p. 240.&lt;/ref&gt; Already, Charles had collected 1,300 Scots prepared to fight in his Jacobite army.&lt;ref name="Browning-p240" /&gt; Defence of the Hanovarian rule of King George II in Great Britain fell to General Sir [[John Cope (British Army officer)|John Cope]], a veteran of the Battle of Dettingen. On 31 August 1745, Cope marched north with about 2,000 British government soldiers.&lt;ref name="Browning-p240" /&gt; Charles reached [[Perth, Scotland|Perth]] on 18 September 1745 and [[Edinburgh]] surrendered to him on 27 September 1745.&lt;ref&gt;Reed Browning, ''The War of Austrian Succession'', p. 241.&lt;/ref&gt; When Cope brought his army up to the town of [[Prestonpans]], Scotland on 1 October 1745, he chose a stubble field that he felt was well protected on which to encamp his troops. However, it was not as safe as he thought, and at sunrise the next morning, 2 October 1745, Charles's Scottish troops attacked and defeated the British government army.&lt;ref&gt;Magnus Magnusson, ''Scotland: The Story of a Nation'' (Grove Press: New York, 2000) p. 594.&lt;/ref&gt; With the government army defeat at Prestonpans, it appeared that all Scotland belonged to Charles. By November 1745, his army consisted of 5,000 infantry men and 300 cavalry.&lt;ref&gt;Reed Browning, ''The War of the Austrian Succession'', p. 242.&lt;/ref&gt; In mid-November 1745 it crossed the border from Scotland and invaded England.

As the Jacobite army moved south into England, Charles kept assuring his troops that aid and reinforcements from English Jacobites would be arriving at any time. This aide and reinforcements were desperately needed as the Jacobites were badly outnumbered by the three British government armies already in the field.&lt;ref&gt;Magnus Magnusson, ''Scotland: The Story of a Nation'', p. 601.&lt;/ref&gt; Finally on 6 December 1745, at Derby in the English midlands, Charles was reluctantly persuaded by his senior officers to turn back to Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;Magnus Magnusson, ''The Story of Scotland'', p. 603.&lt;/ref&gt; Upon hearing about the turnabout in Derby, the French gave up on their plans for an invasion of England.&lt;ref&gt;Magnus Magnusson, ''Scotland: The Story of a Nation'', p. 616.&lt;/ref&gt; The Jacobites felt they could more securely fight the Hanovarians in a defensive battle on Scottish soil rather than fighting the British government army in England. On 17 January 1746, at the [[Battle of Falkirk Muir]], 8,000 Scots, the largest number of troops gathered by the Jacobite cause during the uprising defeated 7,000 British troops.&lt;ref&gt;Magus Magnusson, ''Scotland: The Story of a Nation'', pp. 607–608.&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, however, Charles Stuart and his uprising were defeated on 27 April 1746 at the [[Battle of Culloden]].&lt;ref&gt;Reed Browning, ''The War of the Austrian Succession'', p. 263.&lt;/ref&gt;

The manoeuvres of the armies of both sides in the war on the upper Elbe occupied all the summer. Meanwhile, the political questions of the imperial election and of an understanding between Prussia and Britain were pending. The chief efforts of Austria were directed towards the valleys of the [[Main River|Main]] and of [[Lahn]] and [[Frankfurt]], where the French and Austrian armies manoeuvred for a position from which to overawe the electoral body. Austrian Marshal [[Otto Ferdinand von Abensberg und Traun|Traun]] was successful, and, as a result, Francis, the husband/consort of Maria Theresa was elected Holy Roman Emperor on 13 September 1745. Frederick agreed with Britain to recognise the election a few days later, but Maria Theresa would not conform to the Treaty of Breslau of 1741, by which she had been forced to recognise Frederick's annexation of Silesia. Maria Theresa now tried a further appeal to the fortunes of war to get Silesia back. Saxony joined Austria in this last attempt to reconquer Silesia.

In May 1745, The main Prussian army was stationed at [[Ząbkowice Śląskie|Frankenstein]]. This army consisted of 59,000 soldiers and was fitted with 54 heavy cannons.&lt;ref&gt;Asprey, p. 317.&lt;/ref&gt; Frederick learned that a combined Austrian-Saxon army of about 70,000 troops under the command of Prince Charles, was on the march to the northeast towards [[Landeshut]]. To meet this threat to Silesia, Frederick II marched north toward [[Reichenbach im Eulengebirge|Reichenbach]]. Before he reached Reichenbach, Frederick learned that Prince Charles was crossing the mountains from the west to the east side and that Prince Charles planned to occupy the town of [[Hohenfriedberg]]. Accordingly, Frederick encamped his army at [[Świdnica|Schweidwitz]] and waited for Prince Charles to come to him. At this site, Frederick laid a trap for the superior Austrian-Saxon forces. Indeed, Frederick was operating on the theory that "to catch a mouse, leave the trap open."&lt;ref&gt;Luvaas, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; At 6:30 AM on 4 June 1745, while the Austrian-Saxon troops were still recovering from their long march, the trap was sprung on them in the [[Battle of Hohenfriedberg]].&lt;ref&gt;Asprey, p. 323.&lt;/ref&gt; The Austrian-Saxon forces were no match for Frederick's army and especially his cavalry, and they lost half their artillery and almost a quarter of their men. At 9:00 AM, Prince Charles ordered a full retreat back toward Reichenberg.

A new advance of Prince Charles quickly led to the [[Battle of Soor]] on 30 September 1745, fought on ground destined to be famous in the [[Austro-Prussian War]] of 1866. Frederick commanded an army that at this time numbered only 20,000 soldiers in the vicinity of Soor. He was facing Prince Charles with an army of 41,000 troops.&lt;ref&gt;Asprey, p. 333.&lt;/ref&gt; He was at first in a position of great peril, but his army changed front in the face of the advancing enemy, and by its boldness and tenacity won a remarkable victory on 30 September 1745 at Soor.

But the campaign was not ended. An Austrian contingent from the Main joined the Saxons under Field Marshal [[Frederick Augustus Rutowsky|Rutowsky]] (1702–1764), and a combined movement was made in the direction of Berlin by Rutowsky from Saxony and Prince Charles from Bohemia. The danger was great. Frederick hurried his forces from Silesia and marched as rapidly as possible on [[Dresden]], in Saxony. Frederick won the actions of [[Katholisch-Hennersdorf]] on 24 November 1745 and [[Görlitz]] on 25 November. Prince Charles was thereby forced to abandon his plans to attack Silesia and hurry back to defend Saxony. A second Prussian army under the [[Leopold I, Prince of Anhalt-Dessau|Old Dessauer]] advanced up the Elbe from [[Magdeburg]] to meet Rutowsky. The latter took up a strong position at [[Kesselsdorf]] between [[Meissen]] and [[Dresden]], but the veteran Leopold attacked him directly and without hesitation on 14 December 1745. The Saxons and their allies were completely [[rout]]ed after a hard struggle in the [[Battle of Kesselsdorf]].  Leopold and Frederick then linked up their forces and took Dresden without a struggle.  Maria Theresa was, at last, forced to give way. In the [[Treaty of Dresden]] signed on 25 December 1745, she recognised Frederick's annexation of Silesia, as first recognised in the Peace of Breslau in 1741. Frederick on the other hand recognised the election of Maria Theresa's husband/consort, Francis I, as the Holy Roman Emperor.

==Italian Campaigns 1741–47==
[[File:La familia de Felipe V (Van Loo).jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|right|[[Philip V of Spain]]'s family by [[Louis-Michel van Loo]]]]
In central Italy an army of Spaniards and [[Naples|Neapolitans]] was collected for the purpose of conquering the [[Milan]]ese. In 1741, the allied army of 40,000 Spaniards and Neapolitans under the command of the [[José Carrillo de Albornoz, 1st Duke of Montemar|Duke of Montmar]] had advanced towards [[Modena]], the Duke of Modena had allied himself with them, but the vigilant Austrian commander, Count [[Otto Ferdinand von Abensberg und Traun|Otto Ferdinand von Traun]] had out-marched them, captured Modena and forced the Duke to make a separate peace.

The aggressiveness of the Spanish in Italy forced Empress Maria Theresa of Austria and King [[Charles Emmanuel III of Sardinia|Charles Emmanuel]] of Sardinia into negotiations in early 1742.&lt;ref&gt;Reed Browning, ''The War of the Austrian Succession'', p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt; These negotiations were held at Turin. Maria Theresa sent her envoy [[Count Schulenburg]] and King Charles Emmanuel sent the [[Carlo Vincenzo Ferrero d'Ormea|Marquis d'Ormea]]. On 1 February 1742, Schulenburg and Ormea signed the [[Convention of Turin]] which resolved (or postponed resolution) many differences and formed an alliance between the two countries.&lt;ref&gt;Reed Browning, ''The War of the Austrian Succession'', p. 97.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1742, field marshal Count Traun held his own with ease against the Spanish and Neapolitans. On 19 August 1742, Naples was forced by the arrival of a British naval squadron in Naples' own harbour, to withdraw her 10,000 troops from the Montemar force to provide for home defence.&lt;ref&gt;Reed Browning, ''The War of Austrian Succession'', p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt; The Spanish force under Montemar was now too weak to advance in the [[Po Valley]] and a second Spanish army was sent to Italy via France. Sardinia had allied herself with Austria in the [[Convention of Turin]] and at the same time neither state was at war with France and this led to curious complications, combats being fought in the [[Isère (river)|Isère]] valley between the troops of Sardinia and of Spain, in which the French took no part. At the end of 1742, the Duke of Montemar was replaced as head of the Spanish forces in Italy by [[Jean Thierry du Mont, comte de Gages|Count Gages]].&lt;ref&gt;Reed Browning, ''The War of the Austrian Succession'', p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1743, the Spanish on the [[Panaro (river)|Panaro]] had achieved a victory over Traun at [[Battle of Campo Santo|Campo Santo]] on 8 February 1743.&lt;ref&gt;Reed Browning, ''The War of the Austrian Succession'', pp. 132–133.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the next six months were wasted in inaction and [[Georg Christian, Fürst von Lobkowitz]], joining Traun with reinforcements from Germany, drove back the Spanish to [[Rimini]]. Observing from [[Venice]], [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Rousseau]] hailed the Spanish retreat as "the finest military manoeuvre of the whole century."&lt;ref name="Cranston183"&gt;[[#Cranston|Cranston (1991)]], p. 183&lt;/ref&gt; The Spanish-[[Savoy]]an War in the [[Alps]] continued without much result, the only incident of note being the first Battle of Casteldelfino (7–10 October 1743), when an initial French offensive was beaten off.

In 1744 the Italian war became serious. Prior to the [[War of the Spanish Succession]] (1701–1714) Spain and Austria had been ruled by the same ([[Habsburg]]) royal house. Consequently, the foreign policies of Austria and Spain in regards to Italy had a symmetry of interests and these interests were usually opposed to the interests of [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon]] controlled France.&lt;ref&gt;Rhea Marsh Smith, ''Spain: A Modern History'', pp. 200–201.&lt;/ref&gt; However, since the [[Treaty of Utrecht]] and the end of the War of the Spanish Succession, the childless last Habsburg monarch ([[Charles II of Spain|Charles II]]) had been replaced by the Bourbon grandson of the French king Louis XIV [[Philip V of Spain|Philip of Anjou]], who became Philip V in Spain. Now the symmetry of foreign policy interests in regards to Italy existed between Bourbon France and Bourbon Spain with Habsburg Austria usually in opposition.&lt;ref&gt;Rhea Marsh Smith, ''Spain: A Modern History'', pp. 231–233.&lt;/ref&gt; King [[Charles Emmanuel III of Sardinia|Charles Emmanuel]] of Savoy had followed the long-established foreign policy of Savoy of opposing Spanish interference in northern Italy.&lt;ref name="Smith-p243" /&gt; Now in 1744, Savoy was faced with a grandiose military plan of the combined Spanish and French armies (called the [[Gallispan]] army) for conquest of northern Italy.

However, in implementing this plan, the Gallispan generals at the front were hampered by the orders of their respective governments. For example, the commander of the Spanish army in the field, the [[Louis François, Prince of Conti|Prince of Conti]], could not get along with, or even reason with, the [[Jaime Miguel de Guzmán de Avalos y Spinola|Marquis de La Mina]], the Supreme commander of all Spanish forces.&lt;ref name="Browning-p166"&gt;Reed Browning, ''The War of the Austrian Succession'', p. 166.&lt;/ref&gt; The Prince of Conti felt that the Marquis "deferred blindly to all orders coming from Spain" without any consideration of the realities on the ground.&lt;ref name="Browning-p166" /&gt; In preparation for the military campaign the Gallispan forces sought to cross the Alps in June 1744 and regroup the army in [[Dauphiné]] uniting there with the army on the lower Po.&lt;ref&gt;Reed Browning, ''The War of the Austrian Succession'', p. 167.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Retrato de Carlos III de España.jpg|thumb|left|[[Charles III of Spain]] by [[Anton Raphael Mengs]]]]
The support of [[Genoa]] allowed a road into central Italy.&lt;ref name="Browning-p166" /&gt; While the Prince of Conti stayed in the north, Count [[Jean Bonaventure du Mont, comte de Gages|Gages]] followed this road to the south. But then the Austrian commander, Prince Lobkowitz took the offensive and drove the Spanish army of the [[Jean Bonaventure du Mont, comte de Gages|Count de Gages]] further southward towards the Neapolitan frontier near the small town of [[Velletri]]. Velletri just happened to be the birthplace of [[Caesar Augustus]], but now from June through August 1744, Velletri became the scene of extensive military maneuvering between the French-Spanish army under the command of the Count Gages and the Austrian forces under the command of Prince Lobkowitz&lt;ref&gt;Reed Browning, ''The War of the Austrian Succession'', p. 163.&lt;/ref&gt; The King of Naples (the future [[Charles III of Spain]]) was increasingly worried about the Austrian army operating so close to his borders and decided to assist the Spaniards. Together a combined army of French, Spanish and Neapolitans surprised the Austrian army on the night of 16–17 June 1744. The Austrians were routed from three important hills around the town of Velletri during the attack.&lt;ref name="Browning-p164"&gt;Reed Browning, ''The War of the Austrian Succession'', p. 164.&lt;/ref&gt; This battle is sometimes called the "Battle of Nemi" after the small town of Nemi located nearby. Because of this surprise attack, the combined army was able to take possession of the town of Velletri. Thus, the surprise attack has also been called the "first [[Battle of Velletri (1744)|Battle of Velletri]]."

In early August 1744, the King of Naples paid a visit in person to the newly captured town of Velletri.&lt;ref name="Browning-p164" /&gt; Hearing about the presence of the King, the Austrians developed a plan for a daring raid on Velletri. During the predawn hours of 11 August 1744, about 6,000 Austrians under the direct command of [[Maximilian Ulysses Browne|Count Browne]] staged a surprise raid on the town of Velletri. They were attempting to abduct the King of Naples during his stay in the town. However, after occupying Velletri and searching the entire town, the Austrians found no hint of the King of Naples. The King had become aware of what was happening and had fled through a window of the palace where he was staying and rode off half-dressed on horseback out of the town.&lt;ref&gt;Browning, p. 165.&lt;/ref&gt; This was the second [[Battle of Velletri (1744)|Battle of Velletri]]. The failure of the raid on Velletri meant that the Austrian march toward Naples was over. The defeated Austrians were ordered north where they could be used in the Piedmont of northern Italy to assist the King of Sardinia against the Prince of Conti. Count de Gages followed the Austrians north with a weak force. Meanwhile, the King of Naples returned home.

[[File:Louis 15.jpg|thumb|The [[Louis François, Prince of Conti|Prince of Conti]] by Alexis Simon Belle]]
The war in the Alps and the [[Apennine Mountains|Apennines]] had already been keenly contested before the Prince of Conti and the Gallispan army had come down out of the Alps. [[Battle of Villafranca (1744)|Villefranche]] and [[Montalbán, Teruel|Montalbán]] had been stormed by Conti on 20 April 1744. After coming down out of the Alps, Prince Conti began his advance into Piedmont on 5 July 1744.&lt;ref&gt;Browning, p. 168.&lt;/ref&gt; On 19 July 1744, the Gallispan army engaged the Sardinian army in some desperate fighting at [[Peyre-Longue]] on 18 July 1744.&lt;ref&gt;Browning, pp. 168–169.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of the battle, the Gallispan army took control of [[Casteldelfino]] in the second [[Battle of Casteldelfino]]. Conti then moved on to [[Delmonte]]{{clarify|date=January 2018}} where on the night of 8–9 August 1744, (a mere 36 hours before the Spanish army in south of Italy fought the second Battle of Velletri, [as noted above]) the Gallispan army took the city of Delmonte from the Sardinians in the [[Battle of Delmonte]].&lt;ref&gt;Browning, p. 169.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Charles Emmanuel III of Sardinia|King of Sardinia]] was defeated yet again by Conti in a great Battle at [[Battle of Madonna dell'Olmo|Madonna dell'Olmo]] on 30 September 1744 near Coni ([[Cuneo]]).&lt;ref&gt;Browning, pp. 186–188.&lt;/ref&gt; Conti did not, however, succeed in taking the huge fortress at Coni and had to retire into Dauphiné for his winter quarters. Thus, the Gallispan army never did combine with the Spanish army under Count of Gages in the south and now the Austro-Sardinian army lay between them.

The campaign in Italy in 1745 was also no mere war of posts. The Convention of Turin of February 1742 (described above), which established a provisional relationship between Austria and Sardinia had caused some consternation in the [[Republic of Genoa]]. However, when this provisional relationship was given a more durable and reliable character in the signing of the [[Treaty of Worms (1743)]] signed on 13 September 1743,&lt;ref&gt;Browning, pp. 142–143.&lt;/ref&gt; the government of Genoa became fearful. This fear of diplomatic isolation had caused the Genoese Republic to abandon its neutrality in the war and join the Bourbon cause.&lt;ref name="Browning-p205"&gt;Browning, p. 205.&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, the Genoese Republic signed a secret treaty with the Bourbon allies of France, Spain and Naples. On 26 June 1745, Genoa declared war on Sardinia.&lt;ref name="Browning-p205" /&gt;

Empress Maria Theresa, was frustrated with the failure of Lobkowitz to stop the advance of Gage. Accordingly, Lobkowitz was replaced with Count Schulenburg.&lt;ref&gt;Browing, p. 231.&lt;/ref&gt; A change in the command of the Austrians, encouraged the Bourbon allies to strike first in the spring of 1745. Accordingly, Count de Gages moved from Modena towards [[Lucca]], the Gallispan army in the Alps under the new command of [[Jean-Baptiste Francois des Marets, marquis de Maillebois|Marshal Maillebois]] (Prince Conti and Marshal Maillebois had exchanged commands over the winter of 1744–1745&lt;ref&gt;Browning, p. 204&lt;/ref&gt;) advanced through the [[Italian Riviera]] to the [[Tanaro]]. In the middle of July 1745, the two armies were at last concentrated between the [[Scrivia]] and the Tanaro. Together Count de Gage's army and the Gallispan army composed an unusually large number of 80,000 men. A swift march on [[Piacenza]] drew the Austrian commander thither and in his absence the allies fell upon and completely defeated the Sardinians at [[battle of Bassignano|Bassignano]] on 27 September 1745, a victory which was quickly followed by the capture of [[Alessandria]], [[Valenza]] and [[Casale Monferrato]]. [[Antoine-Henri Jomini|Jomini]] calls the concentration of forces which effected the victory ''"Le plus remarquable de toute la Guerre".''

[[File:Felipe de Parma.jpg|thumb|left|[[Philip, Duke of Parma|Infante Philip of Spain]] by Laurent Pécheux]]
The complicated politics of Italy, however, are reflected in the fact that Count Maillebois was ultimately unable to turn his victory to account. Indeed, early in 1746, Austrian troops, freed by the Austrian peace with Frederick II of Prussia, passed through the [[German Tyrol|Tyrol]] into Italy. The Gallispan winter quarters at [[Asti]], Italy, were brusquely attacked and a French garrison of 6,000 men at Asti was forced to capitulate.&lt;ref&gt;Browning, p. 262.&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, [[Maximilian Ulysses Browne|Maximilian Ulysses Count Browne]] with an Austrian corps struck at the allies on the Lower Po, and cut off their communication with the main body of the Gallispan army in Piedmont. A series of minor actions thus completely destroyed the great concentration of Gallispan troops and the Austrians reconquered the duchy of Milan and took possession of much of northern Italy. The allies separated, Maillebois covering [[Liguria]], the Spaniards marching against Browne. The latter was promptly and heavily reinforced and all that the Spaniards could do was to entrench themselves at Piacenza, [[Duke of Parma|Philip, the Spanish Infante]] as supreme commander calling up Maillebois to his aid. The French, skilfully conducted and marching rapidly, joined forces once more, but their situation was critical, for only two marches behind them the army of the King of Sardinia was in pursuit, and before them lay the principal army of the Austrians. The pitched [[Battle of Piacenza]] on 16 June 1746 was hard fought but ended in an Austrian victory, with the Spanish army heavily mauled. That the army escaped at all was in the highest degree creditable to Maillebois and to his son and chief of staff. Under their leadership the Gallispan army eluded both the Austrians and the Sardinians and defeated an Austrian corps in the [[Battle of Rottofreddo]] on 12 August 1746.&lt;ref&gt;Browning, p. 287.&lt;/ref&gt; Then the Austrian army made good its retreat back to Genoa.

Although the Austrian army was a mere shadow of its former self, when they returned to Genoa, the Austrians were soon in control of northern Italy. The Austrians occupied the [[Republic of Genoa]] on 6 September 1746.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Reed |last=Browning|title=The War of the Austrian Succession|pages= 287–288}}&lt;/ref&gt; But they met with no success in their forays towards the Alps. Soon Genoa revolted from the oppressive rule of the victors, rose and drove out the Austrians on 5–11 December 1746. As an Allied invasion of [[Provence]] stalled, and the French, now commanded by [[Charles Louis Auguste Fouquet, duc de Belle-Isle|Charles Louis Auguste Fouquet, Duc de Belle-Isle]], took the offensive (1747).&lt;ref&gt;Browning, p. 311.&lt;/ref&gt; Genoa held out against a second Austrian siege.&lt;ref&gt;Browning, p. 313.&lt;/ref&gt; As usual the plan of campaign had been referred to Paris and Madrid. A picked corps of the French army under the [[Louis Charles Armand Fouquet|Chevalier de Belle-Isle]] (the younger brother of Marshal Belle-Isle&lt;ref&gt;Reed Browning, ''The War of the Austrian Succession'', p. 311.&lt;/ref&gt;) was ordered to storm the [[Fort of Exilles|fortified pass of Exilles]] on 10 July 1747. However, the defending army of the Worms allies (Austria and Savoy) handed the French army a crushing defeat at this battle, which became known as the ([[Battle of Assietta|Colle dell'Assietta]]).&lt;ref name=Browning312&gt;Browning, p. 312.&lt;/ref&gt; At this battle, the chevalier, and with him much of the elite of the French nobility, were killed on the barricades.&lt;ref name=Browning312/&gt; Desultory campaigns continued between the Worms allies and the French until the conclusion of peace at [[Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (1748)|Aix-la-Chapelle]].

==The Low Countries; 1745-1748==
[[File:Low Countries 1740.png|thumb|left|200px|Map of the Low Countries; [[Bergen op Zoom]], upper center]]
The British and Dutch withdrew from Fontenoy in good order but the French-backed [[Jacobite rising of 1745|Jacobite rising]] of August, 1745 forced the British to transfer troops from Flanders to deal with it. By the end of 1745, the French held the strategic towns of [[Ghent]], [[Oudenaarde|Oudenarde]], [[Bruges]], and [[Dendermonde]], as well as the ports of [[Ostend]] and [[Nieuwpoort, Belgium|Nieuwpoort]], threatening Britain's links to the Low Countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Tucker |first1=Spencer (ed) |title=A Global Chronology of Conflict: From the Ancient World to the Modern Middle East |date=2009 |publisher=ABC-CLIO |isbn=978-1851096671 |page=746}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

During 1746, the French continued their advance into the Austrian Netherlands, taking [[Antwerp]] and then clearing Dutch and Austrian forces from the area between [[Siege of Brussels|Brussels]] and the [[Meuse]]. After defeating the Jacobite Rebellion at [[Battle_of_Culloden|Culloden]] in April, the British launched a diversionary [[raid on Lorient]] in an unsuccessful attempt to divert French forces, while the new Austrian commander, Prince Charles of Lorraine, was defeated by Saxe at the [[Battle of Rocoux]] in October.&lt;ref name="Tucker, p.753"&gt;Tucker, p.753.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[Dutch Republic]] itself was now in danger and in April 1747, the French began reducing their [[Barrier Fortresses|Barrier fortresses]] along the border with the Austrian Netherlands. At [[Battle of Lauffeld|Lauffeld]] on 2 July 1747, Saxe won another victory over a British and Dutch army under the [[William IV, Prince of Orange|Prince of Orange]] and Cumberland; the French then besieged [[Siege of Maastricht (1748)|Maastricht]] and [[Siege of Bergen op Zoom (1747)|Bergen op Zoom]], which fell in September.&lt;ref name="Tucker, p.753"&gt;Tucker, p.753.&lt;/ref&gt;  

These events lent greater urgency to ongoing peace talks at the [[Congress of Breda]], which took place to the sound of French artillery firing on Maastricht. Following their 1746 alliance with Austria, an army of {{Interlanguage link multi|30,000 Russians|ru|3=Рейнский поход (1748)}} marched from [[Livonia]] to the Rhine, but arrived too late to be of use. Maastricht surrendered on 7 May and on 18 October 1748, the war ended with the signing of the [[Treaty_of_Aix-la-Chapelle_(1748)|Peace of Aix-la-Chapelle]].&lt;ref name="Tucker, p.755-756"&gt;Tucker, p.755-756.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conclusion of the war==
[[File:Europe 1748-1766 en.png|thumb|upright=1.2|Europe in the years after the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle in 1748]]

The War of Austrian Succession concluded with the [[Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (1748)]]. Maria Theresa and Austria survived nearly ''[[status quo ante bellum]]'', sacrificing only the territory of Silesia, which Austria conceded to Prussia, and a few minor territorial losses to Spain in northern Italy. While Austria was far from crippled, the loss of Silesia was, in great measure, a humiliating defeat for Austria's leadership of the German states within the Holy Roman Empire. By contrast, Prussian gains nearly doubled the size of its economy, territory and population, while Frederick II's success as a commander soon earned him the epithet "Frederick the Great". This marked the beginning of the [[German dualism]] between Prussia and Austria, which would ultimately fuel German nationalism and the drive to unify Germany as a single entity.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

Despite his victories, Louis XV of France, who wanted to appear as an arbiter and statesman and not as a conqueror, gave all of his conquests back to his defeated enemies with honour, arguing that he was "King of France, not a merchant".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.herodote.net/Louis_XV_1710_1774_-synthese-317.php |title=Hérodote.net, ''Roi «Bien-Aimé»... mais si peu !'' |access-date=6 December 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141208115852/http://www.herodote.net/Louis_XV_1710_1774_-synthese-317.php |archive-date=8 December 2014 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; This decision, largely misunderstood by his generals and by the French people, made the king unpopular at home. The French obtained so little of what they had fought for that they adopted the expressions ''Bête comme la paix'' ("Stupid as the peace") and ''Travailler pour le roi de Prusse'' ("To work for the king of Prussia", i.e. working for nothing). France definitely succeeded in humiliating Maria Theresa and her kingdom. But because of this France had bolstered Prussia's power, which would continue to grow, to France's later detriment. Twice during the war, Prussia had made peace with Austria without informing France, leading Louis XV to consider Frederick II of Prussia (whom he already greatly disliked) an untrustworthy ally. Despite the long history of conflict between the Houses of Habsburg and Bourbon, he began to make overtures of alliance to Austria instead.

Spain, in one way or another, managed to achieve some of her war aims, which mostly centred on an effort to reinstate Spanish influence in the Italian peninsula.

Britain managed to get out of the war with a favorable settlement and on its own terms, which angered the Austrians; Britain's power was increasing and its interests becoming even more complex. Realizing that Austria was no longer the sole hegemon of Central Europe, Britain decided to [[Anglo-Prussian alliance (1756)|align itself with Prussia]] in order to protect Hanover from future French attack. This alliance however ended up destabilizing the continent, as the other great powers braced themselves with a [[Diplomatic Revolution|counter grand alliance]] for an [[Seven Years' War|upcoming war]] that proved to be even grander in scale.

==General character of the war in Europe==
The triumph of Prussia was in a great measure due to its fuller application of principles of tactics and discipline universally recognised though less universally enforced. The other powers reorganised their forces after the war, not so much on the Prussian model as on the basis of a stricter application of known general principles. Prussia, moreover, was far ahead of all the other continental powers in administration, and over Austria, in particular, its advantage in this matter was almost decisive. Added to this was the personal ascendancy of Frederick as both monarch ''and'' commander, as opposed to generals who were responsible for their men to their individual sovereigns.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

The war, like other conflicts of the time, featured an extraordinary disparity between the end and the means. The political schemes to be executed by the French and other armies were as grandiose as any of modern times. Their execution, under the conditions of time and space, invariably fell short of expectations, and the history of the war proves, as that of the [[Seven Years' War]] was to prove, that the small standing army of the 18th century could conquer by degrees, but could not deliver a decisive blow. Frederick alone, with a definite end and proportionate means to achieve it, succeeded. Less was to be expected when the armies were composed of allied contingents, sent to the war each for a different object. The allied national armies of 1813 (at the [[Battle of Leipzig]]) co-operated loyally, for they had much at stake and worked for a common object. Those of 1741 represented the divergent private interests of the several dynasties, and achieved nothing.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

==North America==
{{Main|King George's War}}
{{Campaignbox War Of Austrian Succession: King George's War}}
The war was also conducted in North America and India. In North America the conflict was known in the [[British America|British colonies]] as [[King George's War]], and did not begin until after formal war declarations of France and Britain reached the colonies in May 1744. The frontiers between [[New France]] and the British colonies of [[New England]], [[Province of New York|New York]], and [[Nova Scotia]] were the site of frequent small scale raids, primarily by French colonial troops and their Indian allies against British targets, although several attempts were made by British colonists to organise expeditions against New France. The most significant incident was [[Siege of Louisbourg (1745)|the capture]] of the French [[Fortress Louisbourg]] on [[Cape Breton Island]] (Île Royale) by an expedition (29 April – 16 June 1745) of colonial militia organised by [[Province of Massachusetts Bay|Massachusetts]] Governor [[William Shirley]], commanded by [[William Pepperrell]] of [[Maine]] (then part of Massachusetts), and assisted by a Royal Navy fleet. [[Duc d'Anville expedition|A French expedition]] to recover Louisbourg in 1746 failed due to bad weather, disease, and the death of its commander. Louisbourg was returned to France in exchange for [[Madras]], generating much anger among the British colonists, who felt they had eliminated a nest of privateers with its capture.

==India==
{{further|Carnatic Wars}}
[[File:Flag of the British East India Company (1707).svg|thumb|upright=1.2|Flag of the [[East India Company]] (founded in 1600)]]
[[File:Bombardement de Pondichery en 1748 par la flotte anglaise.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|British Admiral Edward Boscawen [[Siege of Pondicherry (1748)|besieged Pondicherry]] in the later months of 1748.]]

The war marked the beginning of great power in England and the powerful struggle between [[United Kingdom|Britain]] and France in India and of European military ascendancy and political intervention in the subcontinent. Major hostilities began with the arrival of a naval squadron under [[Bertrand-François Mahé de La Bourdonnais|Mahé de la Bourdonnais]], carrying troops from France. In September 1746 Bourdonnais landed his troops near [[Chennai|Madras]] and laid siege to the port. Although it was the main British settlement in the [[Carnatic region|Carnatic]], Madras was weakly fortified and had only a small garrison, reflecting the thoroughly commercial nature of the European presence in India hitherto. On 10 September, only six days after the arrival of the French force, Madras surrendered. The terms of the surrender agreed by Bourdonnais provided for the settlement to be ransomed back for a cash payment by the [[British East India Company]]. However, this concession was opposed by [[Joseph François Dupleix|Dupleix]], the governor general of the Indian possessions of the [[French East India Company|Compagnie des Indes]]. When Bourdonnais was forced to leave India in October after the devastation of his squadron by a cyclone Dupleix reneged on the agreement. The [[Nawab of the Carnatic]] [[Anwaruddin Muhammed Khan]] intervened in support of the British and advanced to retake Madras, but despite vast superiority in numbers his army was easily and bloodily crushed by the French, in the first demonstration of the gap in quality that had opened up between European and Indian armies.

The French now turned to the remaining British settlement in the Carnatic, [[Fort St. David]] at [[Cuddalore]], which was dangerously close to the main French settlement of [[Pondicherry district|Pondichéry]]. The first French force sent against Cuddalore was surprised and defeated nearby by the forces of the Nawab and the British garrison in December 1746. Early in 1747 a second expedition laid siege to Fort St David but withdrew on the arrival of a British naval squadron in March. A final attempt in June 1748 avoided the fort and attacked the weakly fortified town of Cuddalore itself, but was routed by the British garrison.

With the arrival of a naval squadron under [[Edward Boscawen|Admiral Boscawen]], carrying troops and artillery, the British went on the offensive, laying siege to Pondichéry. They enjoyed a considerable superiority in numbers over the defenders, but the settlement had been heavily fortified by Dupleix and after two months the siege was abandoned.

The peace settlement brought the return of Madras to the British company, exchanged for Louisbourg in Canada. However, the conflict between the two companies continued by proxy during the interval before the outbreak of the [[Seven Years' War]], with British and French forces fighting on behalf of rival claimants to the thrones of Hyderabad and the [[Nawab of the Carnatic|Carnatic]].

==Naval operations==
The naval [[Operation (military)|operations]] of this war were entangled with the [[War of Jenkins' Ear]], which broke out in 1739 in consequence of the long disputes between Britain and Spain over their conflicting claims in America. The war was remarkable for the prominence of privateering on both sides. It was carried on by the Spaniards in the West Indies with great success, and actively at home. The French were no less active in all seas. Mahé de la Bourdonnais's attack on Madras partook largely of the nature of a privateering venture. The British retaliated with vigour. The total number of captures by French and Spanish [[Privateer|corsairs]] was in all probability larger than the list of British – as the French wit [[Voltaire]] drolly put it upon hearing his government's boast, namely, that more British merchants were taken because there were many more British merchant ships to take; but partly also because the British government had not yet begun to enforce the use of [[convoy]] so strictly as it did in later times.

{{further|War of Jenkins' Ear}}

===The West Indies===
{{Campaignbox War of Jenkins' Ear}}
[[File:Edward Vernon by Thomas Gainsborough.jpg|thumb|[[Vice-Admiral]] [[Admiral Vernon|Edward Vernon]]]]
War on Spain was declared by Great Britain on 23 October 1739, which has become known as the [[War of Jenkins' Ear]]. A plan was laid for combined operations against the Spanish colonies from east and west. One force, military and naval, was to assault them from the [[West Indies]] under Admiral [[Edward Vernon]]. Another, to be commanded by Commodore [[George Anson, 1st Baron Anson|George Anson]], afterwards Lord Anson, was to round [[Cape Horn]] and to fall upon the Pacific coast of Latin America. Delays, bad preparations, [[dockyard]] corruption, and the squabbles of the naval and military officers concerned caused the failure of a hopeful scheme. On 21 November 1739, Admiral Vernon did, however, succeed in capturing the ill-defended Spanish harbour of [[Porto Bello, Panama|Porto Bello]] in present-day [[Panama]]. When Vernon had been joined by Sir [[Chaloner Ogle]] with massive naval reinforcements and a strong body of troops, an attack was made on [[Battle of Cartagena de Indias|Cartagena]] in what is now [[Colombia]] (9 March – 24 April 1741). The delay had given the Spanish under [[Sebastián de Eslava]] and [[Blas de Lezo]] time to prepare. After two months of skilful defence by the Spanish, the British attack finally succumbed to a massive outbreak of disease and withdrew having suffered a dreadful loss of lives and ships.

The war in the West Indies, after two other unsuccessful attacks had been made on Spanish territory, died down and did not revive until 1748. The expedition under Anson sailed late, was very ill-provided, and less strong than had been intended. It consisted of six ships and left Britain on 18 September 1740. Anson returned alone with his [[flagship]] the ''[[HMS Centurion (1732)|Centurion]]'' on 15 June 1744. The other vessels had either failed to round the Horn or had been lost. But Anson had harried the coast of [[Chile]] and [[Peru]] and had captured a Spanish galleon of immense value near the [[Philippines]]. His cruise was a great feat of resolution and endurance.

After the failure of the British invasions and a Spanish [[Battle of Bloody Marsh|counter invasion]] of [[Province of Georgia|Georgia]] in 1742, belligerent naval actions in the Caribbean were left to the [[privateer]]s of both sides. Fearing great financial and economic losses should a [[Spanish treasure fleet|treasure fleet]] be captured, the Spanish reduced the risk by increasing the number of convoys, thereby reducing their value. They also increased the number of ports they visited and reduced the predictability of their voyages.

In 1744 300 British militia, slaves and regulars with two privateers from [[Saint Kitts]] invaded the French half of neighbouring [[Saint Martin]], holding it until the 1748 [[Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (1748)|Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle]]. In late May 1745 two French royal frigates of 36 and 30 guns respectively under Commodore La Touché, plus three privateers in retaliation sailed from [[Martinique]] to invade and capture Anguilla but were repelled with heavy loss.

The last year of the war saw two significant actions in the Caribbean. A second British [[Battle of Santiago de Cuba (1748)|assault on Santiago de Cuba]] which also ended in failure and a naval action which arose from an accidental encounter between two convoys. The [[Battle of Havana (1748)|action]] unfolded in a confused way with each side at once anxious to cover its own trade and to intercept that of the other. Capture was rendered particularly desirable for the British by the fact that the Spanish homeward-bound fleet would be laden with [[bullion]] from the American mines. The advantage lay with the British when one Spanish warship ran aground and another was captured but the British commander failed to capitalise and the Spanish fleet took shelter in Havana.

===The Mediterranean===
[[File:Combate de Tolón.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|The Franco-Spanish fleet commanded by Don [[Juan José Navarro]] drove off the British fleet under [[Thomas Mathews]] near [[Battle of Toulon (1744)|Toulon in 1744]].]]
While Anson was pursuing his [[George Anson's voyage around the world|voyage round the world]], Spain was mainly intent on the Italian policy of the King. A squadron was fitted out at [[Cádiz]] to convey troops to Italy. It was watched by the British admiral [[Nicholas Haddock]]. When the blockading squadron was forced off by want of provisions, the Spanish admiral Don [[Juan José Navarro]] put to sea. He was followed, but when the British force came in sight of him Navarro had been joined by a French squadron under Claude-Elisée de La Bruyère de Court (December 1741). The French admiral announced{{clarify|pre-text=how?|date=October 2010}} that he would support the Spaniards if they were attacked and Haddock retired. France and Great Britain were not yet openly at war, but both were engaged in the struggle in Germany—Great Britain as the ally of the Queen of Hungary, Maria Theresa; France as the supporter of the Bavarian claimant of the empire. Navarro and de Court went on to [[Toulon]], where they remained until February 1744. A British fleet watched them, under the command of Admiral [[Richard Lestock]], until Sir [[Thomas Mathews]] was sent out as commander-in-chief and as Minister to the Court of [[Turin]].

Sporadic manifestations of hostility between the French and British took place in different seas, but avowed war did not begin until the French government issued its declaration of 30 March, to which Great Britain replied on 31 March. This formality had been preceded by French preparations for the invasion of England, and by the [[Battle of Toulon (1744)|Battle of Toulon]] between the British and a Franco-Spanish fleet. On 11 February, a most confused battle was fought, in which the van and centre of the British fleet was engaged with the Spanish rear and centre of the allies. Lestock, who was on the worst possible terms with his superior, took no part in the action. Mathews fought with spirit but in a disorderly way, breaking the formation of his fleet, and showing no power of direction, while Navarro's smaller fleet retained cohesion and fought off the energetic but confused attacks of its larger enemy until the arrival of the French fleet forced the heavily damaged British fleet to withdraw. The Spanish fleet then sailed to Italy where it delivered a fresh army and supplies that had a decisive impact upon the war. The mismanagement of the British fleet in the battle, by arousing deep anger among the people, led to a drastic reform of the British navy.

===Northern waters===
The French scheme to invade Britain was arranged in combination with the [[Jacobitism|Jacobite]] leaders, and soldiers were to be transported from [[Dunkirk]]. In February 1744, a French fleet of twenty sail of the line entered the [[English Channel]] under [[Jacques Aymar de Roquefeuil et du Bousquet|Jacques Aymar, comte de Roquefeuil]], before the British force under Admiral [[John Norris (Royal Navy officer)|John Norris]] was ready to oppose him. But the French force was ill-equipped, the admiral was nervous, his mind dwelt on all the misfortunes which might possibly happen, and the weather was bad. De Roquefeuil came up almost as far as [[The Downs (ship anchorage)|The Downs]], where he learnt that Sir John Norris was at hand with twenty-five sail of the line, and thereupon precipitately retreated. The military expedition prepared at Dunkirk to cross under cover of De Roquefeuil's fleet naturally did not start. The utter weakness of the French at sea, due to long neglect of the fleet and the bankrupt state of the treasury, was shown during the Jacobite rising of 1745, when France made no attempt to profit by the distress of the British government.

The Dutch, having by this time joined Great Britain, made a serious addition to the naval power opposed to France, though the Dutch Republic was compelled by the necessity for maintaining an army in Flanders to play a very subordinate part at sea. Not being stimulated by formidable attack, and having immediate interests both at home and in Germany, the British government was slow to make use of its latest naval strength. Spain, which could do nothing of an offensive character, was almost neglected. During 1745 the [[New England]] expedition which took Louisburg (30 April – 16 June) was covered by a British naval force, but little else was accomplished by the naval efforts of any of the belligerents.

In 1746 a British combined naval and military expedition to the coast of France – the first of a long series of similar ventures which in the end were derided as "breaking windows with guineas" – was carried out during August and October. The aim was the capture of the [[French East India Company]]'s dockyard at [[Lorient]], but it was not attained.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Harding, ''The Emergence of Britain's Global Naval Supremacy: The War of 1739-1748'' (2010) [https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.7722/j.ctt14brrf4 online] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180830174217/https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.7722/j.ctt14brrf4 |date=30 August 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1747 until the close of the war in October 1748, the naval policy of the British government, without reaching a high level, was more energetic and coherent. A closer watch was kept on the French coast, and effectual means were taken to intercept communication between France and her American possessions. In the spring information was obtained that an important convoy for the East and West [[Indies]] was to sail from L'Orient. The convoy was intercepted by Anson on 3 May, and in the [[First Battle of Cape Finisterre (1747)|first Battle of Cape Finisterre]], British admiral George Anson's fourteen ships of the line wiped out the French escort of six ships of the line and three armed Indiamen, although in the meantime the merchant ships escaped.

On 14 October, another French convoy, protected by a strong squadron, was intercepted by a well-appointed and well-directed squadron of superior numbers – the squadrons were respectively eight French and fourteen British – in the [[Bay of Biscay]]. In the [[Second Battle of Cape Finisterre (1747)|second Battle of Cape Finisterre]] which followed, the French admiral, Henri-François des Herbiers-l'Étenduère, succeeded in covering the escape of most of the merchant ships, but Hawke's British squadron took six of his warships. Most of the merchantmen were later intercepted and captured in the West Indies. This disaster convinced the French government of its helplessness at sea, and it made no further effort.

===The Indian Ocean===
{{main|First Carnatic War}}
{{Campaignbox First Carnatic War}}
In the East Indies, attacks on French commerce by a British squadron under [[Curtis Barnett]] in 1745 led to the despatch of a French squadron commanded by [[Bertrand-François Mahé de La Bourdonnais|Mahé de la Bourdonnais]]. After [[Action of 6 July 1746|an inconclusive clash]] off [[Negapatnam]] in July 1746, [[Edward Peyton]], Barnett's successor, withdrew to Bengal, leaving Bourdonnais unopposed on the [[Coromandel Coast]]. He landed troops near [[Chennai|Madras]] and [[Battle of Madras|besieged the port]] by land and sea, forcing it to surrender on 10 September 1746. In October the French squadron was devastated by a cyclone, losing four ships of the line and suffering heavy damage to four more, and the surviving ships withdrew. French land forces went on to make several attacks on the British settlement at [[Cuddalore]], but the eventual replacement of the negligent Peyton by [[Thomas Griffin (Royal Navy officer)|Thomas Griffin]] resulted in a return to British naval supremacy which put the French on the defensive. Despite the appearance of another French squadron, the arrival of large-scale British reinforcements under [[Edward Boscawen]] (who considered but did not make an attack on [[Mauritius|Île de France]] on the way) gave the British overwhelming dominance on land and sea, but [[Siege of Pondicherry (1748)|the ensuing siege]] of [[Pondichéry]] organised by Boscawen was unsuccessful.

'''''White Fang''''' is a 1991 American [[northern (genre)|Northern]] [[drama film|adventure drama]] film directed by [[Randal Kleiser]], starring [[Ethan Hawke]], [[Klaus Maria Brandauer]] and [[Seymour Cassel]]. Based on [[Jack London]]'s novel ''[[White Fang]]'', it tells the story of the friendship between a young [[Klondike, Yukon|Klondike]] gold prospector and a [[wolfdog]].  White Fang is portrayed by a [[wolfdog]], [[Jed (wolfdog)|Jed]], who also appeared in such films as ''[[The Thing (1982 film)|The Thing]]'' (1982) and ''[[The Journey of Natty Gann]]'' (1985).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1058600/|title=Jed|website=IMDb|access-date=2018-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A sequel to the film, ''[[White Fang 2: Myth of the White Wolf]]'', was released in 1994.

==Plot==
In the late 19th Century, prospectors flock to the [[Yukon]] in search of gold. Among them is young Jack Conroy, who arrives in the town of [[Skagway, Alaska]], telling fellow passenger Beauty Smith of his search for prospector Alex Larson. Smith and his companions, Luke and Tinker, direct the boy to the [[Chilcoot Pass]]. The three men surround Jack and steal his money, but he is undaunted and makes his way to the pass. Jack finds Alex and his companion, Clarence "Skunker" Thurston, at the top of the pass. He introduces himself as the son of Scott Conroy, who died a year earlier, leaving behind a [[Claim (legal)|claim]]. Although Alex and Scott were close friends, the former doubts there is gold in the claim and advises Jack to go home. However, Skunker takes a liking to the boy and persuades Alex to bring him as far as [[Klondike City]], Yukon, after they bury their dead comrade, Dutch. While on their journey, they are stalked by a large pack of wolves. One night, while resting at a campfire, a female wolf named Kiche manages to lure one of the sled dogs (Digger) away from the group, and another wolf appears and chases the dog into the woods. Skunker uses his ammunition to wound Kiche and gives chase to save his dog, but is killed and devoured by the rest of the pack. Later that night the wolves return but are scared off by Jack and Alex using burning branches. The following morning the wolves attack the two men, but they are saved when another sled team arrives with one of the men shooting a female wolf. The fatally injured wolf hobbles back to her den, and her cub remains by her side until she dies. The pup is left to fend for himself. Jack and Alex reach a town where they plan to stay for the winter. When a group of native [[Hän]] discover the cub, their chief, Grey Beaver, notes his "white fang," proving the animal is descended from a domesticated dog. Grey Beaver adopts the cub and names him "Mia Tuk", a name meaning "White Fang".

As spring comes, Jack and Alex resume their quest, but stop off at the native Hän settlement. The chief explains that White Fang has been raised to obey, not to be friendly, but Jack seeks to change that. Jack's chance comes when he is chased and cornered by a [[grizzly bear]]. White Fang intervenes, saving Jack's life. Jack and Alex later leave the settlement. Not long after, White Fang is unfairly traded to Beauty Smith when he blackmails Grey Beaver for the wolfdog, saying that ownership of a wild animal is considered illegal. Smith and his gang train White Fang to be vicious in order to enter him into illegal dogfights. White Fang eventually meets his match in a brutal fight against a bulldog owned by Smith's archrival, Sykes. Jack happens upon the fight and intervenes in the nick of time. Having earlier reached his father's claim and begun the work of digging for gold, Jack returns with White Fang to the cabin where he seeks to transform White Fang's vicious and territorial nature.

Jack's attempts to tame White Fang eventually succeed; both wolfdog and man develop a close and trusting bond. Alex helps Jack mine for gold and they strike it rich with the help of White Fang. One morning, Jack travels to the town to claim proper ownership to the gold when Luke notices White Fang with him. Seeking retaliation and planning to steal the gold, Smith and his men attack the cabin site. White Fang attacks Tinker, who accidentally discharges his gun, wounding Luke. White Fang subdues Smith until he's ordered by Jack to back down. Jack and Alex take Smith and his men prisoner and force them at gunpoint to haul gold ore into town.

Alex and his wife, Belinda, offer to take Jack back to [[San Francisco]], but he lets Jack know that city life is no place for a wolf; he must let White Fang run free in the wild. Though White Fang cannot understand why Jack is trying to leave him, Jack's efforts by using a stick (which White Fang hated/feared when he was under Smith) finally succeed in scaring the [[wolfdog]] off. Later, just as he's boarding the ship back to San Francisco, Jack realizes that his rightful place is in the [[Yukon]] and he  decides to stay behind alone and live off the land; Alex congratulates him by saying that it is what Jack's father would have wanted. After a short time, White Fang returns to the cabin site where he and Jack are happily reunited.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.movieguide.org/reviews/White-Fang.html |title=WHITE FANG &amp;#124; Movieguide &amp;#124; The Family Guide to Movie Reviews |publisher=Movieguide |date=1991-01-18 |accessdate=2013-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Yaroslav Yeromenko''' ({{lang-uk|Єременко Ярослав}}, born 20 January 1989), better known as '''DJ JARR''', is a [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] DJ, [[music producer]] and remixer from [[Kramatorsk]].

==Life and music career==
Yaroslav was born on January 20, 1989 in Kramatorsk. His father Yeromenko Oleg was general director of Star Kramatorsk machine-building plant, and deputy of Kramatorsk city Council. Yaroslav’s father imparted him love to music. Yaroslav went to music school for a guitar class, but he did not finish his studies. At age 16, he went to [[England]] where he studied [[English language|English]]. He lived in [[Brighton]] where he became interested of [[electronic music]], clubs and nightlife. After returning to [[Ukraine]], he began play electronic music. He was a DJ at the main disco of Kramatorsk. In 2007 Yaroslav went to [[Kiev]] to enter the Shevchenko University, which  his family advised him, but finally, despite the advice of the family, chose the Kiev Institute of International Relations&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vp.donetsk.ua/ukraina-mir/obshchestvo/41999-949|title=Год без Олега Еременко|website=vp.donetsk.ua}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The 17th of April  2007 year, Yaroslav's father died  in a car accident that occurred in the [[Dnipropetrovsk Oblast|Dnepropetrovsk region]]. Yaroslav returned to Kramatorsk after his father death. He had to transfer to the Donbass Machine-building Academy and get a job as an engineer, and then get  a job as a sales manager of the Energomashspetsstal factory. 
Soon Yaroslav bought a console, controllers and acted at home closed parties in Kramatorsk. Also Yaroslav decided to start his own business in Svyatogorsk. He worked in the field of marketing communications, especially digital-technology&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://styleinsider.com.ua/2015/04/didzhej-yaroslav-eremenko-saundtrek-k-zhizni/|title=Диджей Ярослав Еременко: Саундтрек к жизни|date=30 April 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.
The 27th of April 2014 year Yaroslav Yeromenko was stopped by the armed formations of the self-proclaimed [[Donetsk People's Republic|DPR]] at one of the roadblocks on the Kramatorsk-Svyatogorsk road near [[Sloviansk |Slavyansk]]. In the trunk of his car the armed formations of the self-proclaimed DPR found a fan scarf of the [[Ukrainian national football team]] and photos with the [[flag of Ukraine]] in his phone.  Really, Yaroslav Yeromenko had never taking an active participation in politics. In spite of this, the armed people suspected Yaroslav of having connections with the [[Right Sector]]. He was declared an "enemy of the republic" and sentenced to immediate execution. However, later this decision was canceled. It was decided to send Yaroslav to Slavyansk for further clarification of the circumstances&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://inspired.com.ua/creative/music/yeromenko/|title=З полону в діджеї: історія Ярослава Єрьоменка|date=9 June 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. He was tortured and beaten by armed people of the self-proclaimed DPR, and while beating, they forced to shout "Glory to Ukraine" and sing the anthem of Ukraine&lt;ref name="platfor.ma"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://opinion.platfor.ma/plen/|title=Музыка из плена: история музыканта в плену у сепаратистов|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cripo.com.ua/?sect_id=1&amp;aid=175193|title=Заложники криминалитета: как и за что террористы на Донбассе мучают захваченных людей|website=cripo.com.ua}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

 «Especially, I was tortured because I being a local and do not support the new regime. The blue and yellow scarf found in the trunk was tied round my neck and the warders passing by me periodically choked me to them»&lt;ref name="platfor.ma"/&gt;.
In the basement of the SBU building in Slavyansk, Yaroslav was in the same cell with the stage-manager Pavel Yurov and the artist Denis Grischuk. There they were tortured and beaten. Thanks to the efforts of Yaroslav's mother, he managed to free himself from captivity. The 1 of May 2014 year, after spending four days in the basement, he was released. He  returned things and documents. The car Honda Accord 2010 was confiscated in favor of the self-proclaimed  Donetsk People's Republic&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://focus.ua/society/305993/|title=Как и за что сепаратисты мучают своих пленников - ФОКУС|website=ФОКУС}}&lt;/ref&gt;. After his release, he was taken out of the barricade of roadblocks  of armed people, a bandage was removed from his eyes, and ordered to go without turning around. Enterprises belonging to Yeromenko family in Kramatorsk were looted. Warehouses that Eremenko rented were cut to scrap metal&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://34.ua/news/view/39202--v-donecke-sutki-proderzhali-v-plenu-polyskogo-svyashhennika/|title=В Донецке сутки продержали в плену польского священника|website=34.ua}}&lt;/ref&gt;.
After his release from captivity, Yaroslav left Kramatorsk and went to his relatives in [[Dnepropetrovsk]], and then - to Kiev. After return to Kiev, he decided to become a professional musician. According to his words indicated in further interviews, he seriously devoted himself to a musical career after release from captivity.

 «All these crazy experiences helped me to realize the value of each day of our short and such a fragile life. Now I really care about every hour I've been given».
 «I dreamed of doing music all my life - doubts, the belief that there are ways «right» and "wrong" before all these events kept me from the employment that I dreamed of doing. A senseless bloody war every day takes the lives of young, talented people who had something to say to this world.
