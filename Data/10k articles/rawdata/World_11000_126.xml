{{Economy of Serbia}}
[[File:Serbia Vojka from southwest IMG 9207.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Over 60% of Serbia is [[arable land]]]]

'''Agriculture in Serbia''' is still an important section of [[Economy of Serbia|Serbian economy]] with an annual potential of [[Euro|EUR]] 12 billion in exports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.b92.net/eng/news/business.php?yyyy=2013&amp;mm=03&amp;dd=15&amp;nav_id=85194|title=Serbia's agricultural potential - EUR 12 billion|publisher=B92|date=15 March 2013|accessdate=14 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The total area of agricultural land exceeds 6.12 million hectares.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://siepa.gov.rs/en/index-en/key-industries/food.html|title=Food Industry|publisher=SIEPA|accessdate=14 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/agriculture/enlargement/countries/serbia/profile_en.pdf |title=Agriculture and Enlargement |publisher=European Commission |date=May 2011 |accessdate=14 June 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130517201548/http://ec.europa.eu/agriculture/enlargement/countries/serbia/profile_en.pdf |archivedate=17 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Agricultural production is most prominent in Northern Serbia on the fertile [[Pannonian Plain]], and the southern lowlands adjacent to the [[Sava]], [[Danube]] and [[Great Morava]] rivers. There has been in a sharp decline in agricultural activity since 1948, when almost three-quarters of the population engaged in farming, to the present one-quarter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/654691/Serbia/42938/Agriculture-and-forestry|title=Agriculture and forestry|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=14 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production==
Serbia produces various agricultural products, mostly grains, fruits and vegetables which constitute a significant part of its [[GDP]] and exports.

'''Ahlbeck Pier''' ([[German language|German]]: ''Seebrücke Ahlbeck''  [[Polish language|Polish]]: ''Molo w Czerninie'') - a [[pier]] located in [[Ahlbeck]], on the island of [[Usedom]]; it is the oldest [[pier]] in [[Germany]]. The [[pier]] stretches from the ''Imperial Beach'' for 280 metres into the [[Baltic Sea]]. The [[pier]] has a restaurant and a [[jetty]] at the end of the pier primarily used for sightseeing tours in the [[Bay of Pomerania]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ahlbeck Pier|url=http://podrozepolskiemorzekompendiumwiedzy.blogspot.co.uk/2013/04/swinoujscie-w-najblizszym-sasiedztwie.html|website=Podróże Polskie Pomorze Kompendium Wiedzy|accessdate=6 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

==History==

In 1882, a platform which extended from the promenade was built and housed a restaurant, in 1898 works began for the platform to be extended for 280 metres into the [[Baltic Sea]]. The main function of the [[pier]] was to function as a [[jetty]] for [[Sailing ship|sailing ships]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ahlbeck History|url=http://www.usedom01.republika.pl/ahlbeck.html|website=Uznam|accessdate=6 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1905, the [[pier]] was joined with the platform which housed the restaurant. In 1926, the [[canvas]] [[boardwalk]] located in the mid-section of the [[pier]] was replaced with [[Wood|wooden]] [[Plank (wood)|planks]]. Throughout the [[pier]]'s existence it has undergone many renovations to replace any rotten elements. In 1970 to 1973 the pier had undergone a major reconstruction in which the [[Wood|wooden]] [[Column|pillars]] and structure was replaced with [[steel]] [[Girder|girders]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ahlbeck Pier|url=http://www.seebruecke-ahlbeck.de/speisekarte.html|website=Seebruecke Ahlbeck|accessdate=6 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Akathaso''''' ({{lang-my|အာကာသစိုး}}) are Burmese ''[[nat (spirit)|nats]]'' (spirits) who inhabit the tops of trees and serve as guardians of the sky. ''Akathaso'' is derived from [[Pali]] ''akasa deva'' ({{my|အာကာသဒေဝ}}), which literally means "deity of the sky."{{sfn|MLC|1993}}

They are related to ''[[Yokkaso]]'' ({{my|ရုက္ခစိုး}}) and ''[[Bhummaso]]'' ({{my|ဘုမ္မစိုး}}), who respectively live on the trunks and roots of the trees. ''Bhummaso'' are guardian spirits of the earth while ''yokkaso'' are guardian spirits of trees.{{sfn|MLC|1993}}

The '''Baron of Fonte Bela''' ({{lang-pt|Barão da Fonte Bela}}) was a title created by decree on 3 March 1836, confirmed by letter on 12 March 1836, by Queen [[Maria II of Portugal|Maria II]], in favour of [[Jacinto Inácio Rodrigues da Silveira]], a rich merchant and [[Liberal Wars|liberal]] politician from [[Ponta Delgada]], in the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] archipelago of the [[Azores]].

==List of barons==
# [[Jacinto Inácio Rodrigues da Silveira]], 1st Baron of Fonte Bela;
# [[Amâncio Gago da Câmara]], 2nd Baron and 1st [[Count of Fonte Bela]];
# [[Jacinto da Silveira Gago da Câmara]], 2nd Count of Fonte Bela;
# [[Jacinto Inácio da Silveira de Andrade Albuquerque Gago da Câmara]], 3rd Count of Fonte Bela.

After the installation of the Portuguese Republic, the monarchy was abolished, resulting in the transformation of [[Estevão Gago da Câmara]], into pretender to this title.

'''CIBK-FM''' is a [[contemporary hit radio|Top 40/CHR]] station based in [[Calgary]], [[Alberta]], Canada. The [[Bell Media]] outlet operates at 98.5&amp;nbsp;MHz [[FM radio|FM]] with an [[effective radiated power]] of 100&amp;nbsp;kW from a transmitter located at the intersection of Old Banff Coach Road and 85 Street Southwest, and studio located at CTV studios on Patina Rise.

CIBK is currently ranked #6 according to the Fall 2014 PPM Data report released by BBM Canada.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.radiowest.ca/forum/viewtopic.php?f=46&amp;t=19694 Fall 2014 Calgary PPM Ratings]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The station received approval by the [[Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission|CRTC]] in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crtc.gc.ca/eng/archive/2001/DB2001-172.htm Decision CRTC 2001-172], ''CRTC'', March 12, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; When CIBK made its debut on September 6, 2002 as ''Vibe 98.5'', they thought they would become the city's first [[R&amp;B]]/[[hip hop music|hip hop]] outlet, but they were beaten to the punch by [[CJAQ-FM|CKIS]] (KISS 96.9) by about a month. This would spark a format war in Calgary, with both stations making potshots at one another. On April 1, 2003, CKIS would bail out and abruptly change to the [[Jack FM]] format, leaving CIBK as the victor.

However, CIBK would also go through an evolution of its own as they transitioned to a [[rhythmic contemporary]] direction by [[2003 in radio|2003]], and to their current mainstream top 40 direction by [[2004 in radio|2004]]. CIBK still played R&amp;B/hip hop product (although at a reduced rate), and also incorporated [[pop music|pop]] and [[dance music|dance]] into the mix, in part due to its license with the CRTC that now requires the station to be programmed as a CHR outlet. Because CIBK was anticipated for years prior to its launch to be Calgary's long-awaited urban station, it had faced much criticism for bailing out to a Top 40 format leaving many of the station's hip-hop/R&amp;B fans disappointed and let down by Standard.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

CIBK was part of the acquisition of most of the assets of [[Standard Broadcasting]] by [[Astral Media]] that was completed on October 29, [[2007 in radio|2007]]. Under Astral, CIBK dropped the rhythmic lean.

On April 1, 2010, [[Astral Media]] registered the domain names, VirginRadio985.com, Virgin985.com and VirginCalgary.com, which many speculated would be a branding change for CIBK to become a part of the ''[[Virgin Radio]]'' branding in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;[http://radioinsight.com/2010/04/27/a-virgin-coming-to-calgary/ Branding Change]&lt;/ref&gt; This was confirmed on the Vibe Morning Show's June 23, 2010 broadcast, and the rebranding took place on June 30 at Noon,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vibe985.com/|title=Vibe 98.5 main page, "Tomorrow on The Vibe Morning Show"|date=June 23, 2010|accessdate=June 23, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100209183250/http://www.vibe985.com/#|archive-date=2010-02-09|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and will retain its [[Top 40]] format. It is the second [[Virgin Radio]] station with a mainstream [[top 40]] format after [[Toronto]]'s [[CKFM-FM|CKFM]]. The last song to be played on "Vibe" was "[[Goodbye (Kristinia DeBarge song)|Goodbye]]" by [[Kristinia DeBarge]], while the first song on "Virgin Radio" was "[[California Gurls]]" by [[Katy Perry]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://calgary.virginradio.ca/broadcasthistory.aspx Virgin Radio's playlist]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLI8gFAj5LE&lt;/ref&gt;

CIBK-FM is the longest-tenured [[contemporary hit radio|CHR]] station in [[Alberta]] still having the format today, only [[Edmonton]]'s [[CKNG-FM]] (now [[adult hits]] since [[2004 in radio|2004]]) had the longest-tenured format from [[1991 in radio|1991]]-[[2003 in radio|2003]].

As part of the merger of Astral and [[Bell Media]] approved by the [[Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission|CRTC]] on June 27, 2013, CIBK is now owned by Bell Media.

== Music format ==
Like most other Canada's Virgin Radio stations, CIBK brands itself as broadcasting "the most hit music" with 40 minutes of commercial free hit music each hour and it also broadcasts the extended version of this kind between 4:25 and 5:55 PM weekdays.

'''Parliamentary elections''' were held in the [[Comoros]] on 6 December 2009, with a second round on 20 December. The elections were originally scheduled for July 2009,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.afriquejet.com/news/africa-news/comoros-to-hold-legislative,-local-government-elections-on-2-august-2009061930055.html Comoros to hold legislative, local government elections on 2 August] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120319061100/http://www.afriquejet.com/news/africa-news/comoros-to-hold-legislative%2C-local-government-elections-on-2-august-2009061930055.html |date=2012-03-19 }}, Afrique Jet, 18 June 2009&lt;/ref&gt; but were postponed until after a [[Comorian constitutional referendum, 2009|constitutional referendum]] was held in May 2009. They were then scheduled to take place on 29 November,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alwatwan.net/pdf/09102009.pdf|title=Ceni : en attendant le budget|last=Hassani|first=Ahmed|date=8 October 2009|publisher=Al Watwan|pages=3|language=French|accessdate=2009-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; but were delayed again. The result was a victory for the Baobab Movement, a coalition supporting President [[Ahmed Abdallah Mohamed Sambi]]. 

==Electoral system==
The elections were held using the [[two-round system]] with 24 single-member constituencies. The remaining nine seats in the [[Assembly of the Union of the Comoros|Assembly of the Union]] were filled by appointees from the assemblies of the autonomous islands of the Comoros, [[Grande Comore]], [[Mohéli]] and [[Anjouan]], with each island selecting three members.

==Campaign==
Most candidates supporting President Sambi campaigned as the Baobab coalition, named after their identifying symbol, the [[Baobab]] tree.

'''"Diamond of Night"''' was the [[Estonia]]n entry in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1999]], performed in [[English Language|English]] (the first time Estonia had not sung in [[Estonian Language|Estonian]], although a version was recorded in that language) by singer [[Evelin Samuel]] and violinist [[Imbi Rätsep]] as "Camille". The Estonian version was titled '''"Langevate tähtede aeg"''' ("Time of shooting stars"), lyrics written by [[Kaari Sillamaa]].

The song was performed twenty-third on the night, following [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]]'s [[Dino Merlin|Dino]] and [[Béatrice Poulot|Béatrice]] with "[[Putnici]]". At the close of voting, it had received 90 points, placing 6th in a field of 23.

The song is folk-inspired and is an ode to the moon, with Samuel asking it to guide her steps.

With Evelin and Camille, there were a [[harpist]] [[Saale Kivimaker]] on stage, as well as two backing vocalists, [[Anneli Tõevere]] and [[Maian-Anna Kärmas]], the latter also a lyricist of that song.

Maian-Anna Kärmas has described the birth of the English lyrics greatly in relation to the experience in 1998 when Evelin Samuel very narrowly lost a pass to Eurovision Song Contest. For entirely believing in Evelin Samuel, and the song written especially for the occasion, she then wrote a meaningful line ''now I can say it is my time'' to end end of the chorus.

It was succeeded as [[Estonia in the Eurovision Song Contest|Estonian representative]] at the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2000|2000 contest]] by [[Eda-Ines Etti|Ines]] with "[[Once in a Lifetime (Ines song)|Once In A Lifetime]]".

The '''Douala Stock Exchange''' ('''DSX''' in abbreviation) is the official market for [[securities]] in [[Cameroon]].  It is located in [[Douala]].

== History ==

The origin of the market in Douala began in a project sponsored by [[CEMAC]] having to do with creating [[stock exchange]]s in [[Gabon]] and Cameroon.  CEMAC is the abbreviation for [[Economic and Monetary Community of Central Africa]].

The '''Douala Stock Exchange''' was created in December 2001.  The first listing was [[Société des Eaux Minérales du Cameroun]] (SEMC), a subsidiary of the French company [[Castel Group]].

DSX is owned by APECCAM, (the [[Credit Association of Cameroon]]); by Cameroonian corporate interests; and by the government.  It is similarly governed:

Administration Board:
* APECCAM  : 7 seats
* Corporate : 2 seats
* Government : 1 seat
* Other : 1 seat

Until 2006, its sole listing was (SEMC). Now it also includes Société Africaine Forestière et Agricole du Cameroun (SAFACAM) and SOCAPALM.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.straightstocks.com/current-market-news/trivia-what-is-the-smallest-stock-exchange-in-the-world/|title=What is the Smallest Stock Exchange in the World?|accessdate=2008-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2430">The '''European Unit of Account''' (EUA) was a [[unit of account]] used in the [[European Communities]] from 1975 to 1979, when it was replaced at parity by the [[European Currency Unit]], in turn replaced at parity in 1999 by the [[euro]].

Initially it was used for [[Lomé Convention]] and [[European Investment Bank]] operations before being gradually introduced into other sectors of Community activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.europeaninstitute.org/EU-Facts/timeline-of-the-european-union.html |title=Timeline of the European Union &amp;#124; EU Facts |publisher=Europeaninstitute.org |date= |accessdate=2010-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The EUA was a basket of European currencies, originally designed to have the same value in mid-1974 as the IMF [[special drawing rights]] basket, both worth US$1.20635; they immediately moved apart in value. Different units of account had previously been used for different purposes, including the budget, the [[European Coal and Steel Community]], and the [[Common Agriculture Policy]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://aei.pitt.edu/7861/01/31735055281731_1.pdf The Units of Account as a Factor of Integration] CEC 87/75&lt;/ref&gt; following the abandonment of the [[gold parity unit of account]] in the early 1970s in the wake of the collapse of the [[Bretton Woods system]].&lt;ref name=eupf&gt;[http://www.biblioteca.porto.ucp.pt/docbweb/multimedia/associa/pdf/eur_u.pdf European Union Public Finance]{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, European Commission, {{ISBN|92-894-1620-3}}, published 2002, accessed 20112-01-09&lt;/ref&gt;

Various European [[currency basket]]s were used as units of account in international [[bond market]]s.

'''The Geneva Association''' is an international think tank for strategically important [[insurance]] and risk management issues.

The Geneva Association identifies fundamental trends and strategic issues where insurance plays a substantial role or which influence the insurance sector. Through the development of research programmes, regular publications and the organisation of international meetings, The Geneva Association aims to enhance the understanding of risk and insurance matters and acts as an information creator and disseminator. It acts as the voice of the largest insurance groups worldwide in the dialogue with international institutions. In parallel, it advances—in economic and cultural terms—the development and application of risk management and the understanding of uncertainty in the modern economy.

In this role, it is primarily concerned with studying climate risk and the role insurance can play in disaster risk reduction; the rising costs related to ageing populations, either in long-term care, age-related illnesses such as dementia, or retirement funding; liability concerns; and the issue of financial stability in insurance and the development of an efficient regulatory framework.

Established in 1973, The Geneva Association, officially the “International Association for the Study of Insurance Economics”, is based in Zurich, Switzerland and is a non-profit organisation funded by its members.

The Geneva Association membership comprises a statutory maximum of 90 chief executive officers (CEOs) from the world’s top insurance and reinsurance companies. It organises international expert networks and manages discussion platforms for senior insurance executives and specialists as well as policy-makers, regulators and multilateral organisations. The Chairman of The Geneva Association is currently [[Mike McGavick]], CEO of [http://xlcatlin.com/ XL Catlin].

The general secretariat handles the daily operations of the association. Its work is directed by the secretary general, and the deputy secretary general and head of insight. Currently these positions are held respectively by Anna Maria D'Hulster and Antoine Baronnet.

All of The Geneva Association's activities are pursued by means of research, publications and the organisation of international conferences. In addition, The Geneva Association organises international expert networks and manages discussion platforms for senior insurance executives and specialists as well as policy-makers, regulators, academics and international organisations. The Geneva Association’s annual General Assembly is the most prestigious gathering of leading insurance CEOs worldwide. Speakers at The Geneva Association’s seminars have included [[Nobel Prize]] winners such as Kenneth J. Arrow,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/economics/laureates/1972/|title=The Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel 1972|publisher=Nobelprize.org|accessdate=4 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Josef Stiglitz,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/economics/laureates/2001/|title=The Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel 2001|publisher=Nobelprize.org|accessdate=4 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  as well as important figures of the political and economic arena such as former British Prime Minister [[Tony Blair]]; head of the International Monetary Fund, [[Christine Lagarde]]; former U.S. Vice President [[Al Gore]]; Chancellor of the Exchequer, [[George Osborne]]; and Governor of the Bank of England and Chairman of the FSB, [[Mark Carney]].

The Geneva Association was founded under the initiative of a [[committee]] which met for the first time in Paris on 22 September 1971. This founding committee was constituted by the following people:

* '''Mr. Emil Frey''', general manager, Mannheimer Versicherung (Mannheim);

==Membership==

Today, The Geneva Association has members from 28 countries around the world. Its members are the chief executive officers of the largest insurance companies in the world, and they are members in a personal capacity. The statutory limit to the number of members is 90. Applications of new members are examined by the board of directors at the proposal of the chairman and, if recommended, are submitted to the general assembly for approval by majority vote.

==Key research topics==
===Financial stability and regulation===
After the financial crisis erupted in 2008, The Geneva Association set up a special working group specifically to analyse the relationship between [[systemic risk]], financial stability and insurance. The association has since published ten reports, studies or articles&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.genevaassociation.org/news-media/key-documents-financial-stability|title=Financial Stability &amp; Regulation topic dossier|work=genevaassociation.org|accessdate=4 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; on various aspects of financial stability and regulation in insurance, including the identification of systemic risk, designation methodology, surrenders, insurance and resolution, variable annuities, and global capital standards.

Through both the Insurance and Finance and PROGRES programmes of The Geneva Association, there has been an ongoing dialogue with the IAIS and other supervisory bodies. In the discussions on systemic risk regulation however, a multitude of organisations such as the [[G-20]], the [[International Monetary Fund|IMF]], the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]] to name but a few, have become involved and influential in the setting of new insurance systemic risk regulations. As a result, the association has broadened its discussions and on several occasions, has engaged these other organisations directly in the form of open letters or comments to address points made.

===Climate risk===
In May 2008, following a mandate from its members at the 2008 General Assembly, The Geneva Association began its Climate Change and Insurance (CC+I) research project in response to one of the most multi-faceted challenges to the insurance industry since its inception.

On 6 September 2010, The Geneva Association and three other initiatives (ClimateWise, MCII and UNEP-FI) launched a joint statement that calls on governments worldwide to harness risk management techniques and insurance expertise to help implement climate change adaptation measures in the developing world. In the context of the increasing economic and human costs of climate change in the developing world, the statement seeks to highlight how governments can unlock significant potential to increase the protection and reduce the vulnerability of developing world populations and economies.

“The insurance industry is uniquely positioned to provide specialised services for countries and businesses facing climate risks worldwide. Insurers have the expertise to develop a broad range of affordable private insurance solutions for climate risks.	Insurance mechanisms are an effective tool to promote climate related risk management and reduction; The Geneva Association recognises that no stakeholder can succeed alone in solving the challenges of climate change. Insurance can and should be a strong complementary mechanism in a wider framework of adaptation.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.genevaassociation.org/Portals/0/Kyoto_Statement_signed_14July09.pdf |format=PDF |title=The Kyoto Statement of The Geneva Association |date=29 May 2009 |publisher=Genevaassociation.org |accessdate=4 January 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130411131355/http://www.genevaassociation.org/Portals/0/Kyoto_Statement_signed_14July09.pdf |archivedate=11 April 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, the name of the project was changed to Climate Risk and Insurance (CR+I). The objectives of the climate-linked research are to identify and analyse:
* issues that are of specific relevance to the insurance industry, such as the likely range of future claims costs, new business opportunities and scenario testing; and
* external challenges to be addressed at the political, educational and social levels, such as the role of governments and public-private cooperation, to mitigate the impact of natural catastrophes.

To this end, The Geneva Association has issued several reports and studies on climate risk and disaster reduction,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.genevaassociation.org/news-media/key-documents-climate-risk|title=Climate Risk and Extreme Events|work=genevaassociation.org|accessdate=4 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as a review of 2011 marked in particular by the tsunami in Japan and, most recently, a study on the warming of the oceans.

'''The Climate Risk Statement'''
On 20 May 2014, following The Geneva Association's 41st General Assembly in Toronto, 67 chief executives of the world’s leading insurers confirmed their commitment to The Geneva Association’s Climate Risk Statement – a set of guiding principles on the substantial role insurance can play in global efforts to tackle climate-related risks. The statement provides the foundations on which the direction of future climate-related initiatives by The Geneva Association will be based.

This statement confirms the Kyoto Statement signed in 2009, with additional signatures and reflecting the latest scientific evidence. Michael Butt, chairman of AXIS Capital and co-chair of the Climate Risk and Insurance working group, said: "The Climate Risk Statement Provides a reference point for policymakers, non-governmental organisations, customers, as well as the insurance industry itself, on the ways in which insurance can complement global efforts to mitigate and adapt to climate change. Our industry can make a considerable contribution to global efforts to reduce the impact of climate change, but reaching its full potential will require greater collaboration with governments and global governance bodies such as the United Nations."

The Statement received the full support of former U.S. Vice-President Al Gore, who spoke at The Geneva Association's General Assembly in Toronto: "The insurance industry has long ago taken the initiative on climate risk, and with this statement commits to do even more. As an industry it has the capacity to work with policymakers on the mitigation of climate-related risks. If market forces are leveraged and elected officials and regulators are engaged wisely, insurers have so much to offer, and can help the world deal with this serious issue. Most people don't want to think about long-term risk. Now that our world is facing the gravest risks it has ever faced, the world should turn to insurers for advice. In turn, insurers must be more vocal about the challenges they see."

===Global ageing===
The cost of pensions and retirement policy challenges are among the key issues in policy responses to the European sovereign debt crisis since 2010. The challenge of financing retirement is largely due to improved longevity and lower fertility rates that are not properly represented in the cost of retirement.&lt;ref&gt;Cigno. A (1995) "Public Pensions with endogeneous fertility", Journal of Public economics, 57, 169-173.&lt;/ref&gt; Adding to this concern about how to support a growing number of pensions living longer lives is the increase in age-related illnesses such as dementia, and the health-care costs of an ageing population.

The Geneva Association has been studying these issues through its Life and Pensions and Health and Ageing programmes for many years proposing solutions to the challenges they raise that are now more urgently needed than ever.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.genevaassociation.org/news-media/key-documents-global-ageing|title=The Geneva Association|work=genevaassociation.org|accessdate=4 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Public Pensions Crisis in the U.S.'''

On 3 December 2013, Detroit became the largest city in the U.S. to become legally eligible for Chapter 9 bankruptcy. Its ballooning deficits and large pension shortfall are not an isolated case, however. Across the country, states have posted funding shortfalls or more than a trillion dollars.

In its report on this crisis, The Geneva Association examines the issues at the root of this crisis and suggests that the non-payment of annual required contributions and an unbalanced structure to pension planning are among the most significant challenges to overcome.

''Executive summary of the report''

• A 2010 report by the Pew Center on the States highlights the trillion-dollar shortfall facing state and local retirement systems in the U.S. due to policy choices and a lack of fiscal discipline, namely the failure to make annual payments for pensions systems at actuarially recommended levels and expanding benefits without considering their long-term costs. The majority of states (34) have a funding level below 80 per cent.

• The Geneva Association has long advocated a four-pillar approach to sound pension planning: (1) a universal public system such as Social Security, (2) an occupational pensions system supported by employers under government financial supervision, (3) private savings using financial intermediaries and (4) continued employment, through the removal of barriers to partial employment of retirees.

• Excessive reliance on one of the four pillars—particularly a public system or private savings only—strains public finances and/or an individual’s ability to finance retirement adequately. The Geneva Association has also highlighted the unnecessary losses of human capital resulting from restrictions on the employment of retirees. Human capital, i.e. the ability to earn income, should be valued, particularly in societies with ageing populations.

• The Geneva Association calls for more in-depth study of solutions to the pension crisis the U.S.

==Meetings, seminars and conferences==
To achieve its main goals, The Geneva Association organises or co-organises a number of meetings, seminars and conferences. The most important meeting of The Geneva Association is its general assembly that takes place every year. At this occasion, key economic issues are discussed by members, the CEOs of the world’s leading insurers, special observers including regulators and guest speakers from inside and outside the industry. In 2010, former Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Tony Blair, provided a keynote speech. Stemming from General Assemblies, as of 2010, The Geneva Association produces General Assembly Reviews, giving a hindsight view of discussions and presentations having taken place at the meeting. The Geneva Association regularly organises international conferences which are linked to its research programmes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.genevaassociation.org/Conference_Events/Programmes.aspx |title=Events |publisher=The Geneva Association |accessdate=2007-05-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516060752/http://www.genevaassociation.org/Conference_Events/Programmes.aspx |archivedate=2008-05-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prizes, research grants, and awards==
In its role of promoting research in risks and insurance economics, The Geneva Association also awards a series of prizes and research grants every year. It also awards two research grants for submissions, usually in the form of a doctoral thesis, carried out in the field of risk and insurance economics.
Subsidies of up to CHF 3,000 are also granted to authors of university theses on risk and insurance economics to help defray printing costs and to support the publication of high quality work.

'''The Geneva Association / IIS Research Awards'''
The Geneva Association and the International Insurance Society (IIS) have joined in a programme with business leaders in insurance to sponsor applied research in the insurance area. The purpose of the research programme is to create original, practically oriented research which addresses current business issues and problems of concern to senior insurance executives around the world. The programme is designed to fulfill a need of business to investigate subjects which directly influence daily business operations and operational business concerns or issues on a practical level.
Researchers present the research selected to business executives at the yearly meeting of the International Insurance Society. The research is published and distributed by both the IIS and The Geneva Association in a special edition of ''The Geneva Papers on Risk and Insurance—Issues and Practice''. Research Awards for the best-qualified papers are presented in an amount up to $10,000.

'''The Ernst-Meyer Prize'''
The Geneva Association awards every year the prestigious Ernst-Meyer Prize for university research work, usually in the form of a doctoral thesis, which makes a significant and original contribution to the study of risk and insurance economics.

'''Research Grants'''
Every year, the association offers two grants for research into risk and insurance economics, on various subjects in economic theory and practice.

==Publications==

The Geneva Association publications take six different forms in addressing its various audiences: 
* Two academic journals, ''The Geneva Papers on Risk and Insurance—Issues and Practice'' and ''The Geneva Risk and Insurance Review'' (formerly'' The Geneva Papers on Risk and Insurance Theory''); 
* Research reports, presentations and white papers on key issues of concern to the industry, policymakers and academics:
* Ad hoc reports on major themes discussed throughout a part of the year, otherwise known as ''The Geneva Reports''; 
* Seven different newsletters; 
* Conference Papers, or working papers from conferences and meetings; and, 
* Books written by The Geneva Association staff and/or external collaborators.

'''''The Geneva Papers on Risk and Insurance—Issues and Practice'''''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.genevaassociation.org/publications/gpp|title=The Geneva Papers|work=genevaassociation.org|accessdate=4 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.palgrave-journals.com/gpp/index.html|title=The Geneva Papers on Risk and Insurance - Issues and Practice|publisher=Palgrave-journals.com|accessdate=4 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Founded in 1976 and published quarterly by Palgrave, ''The Geneva Papers'' publish papers which both improve the scientific knowledge of the insurance industry and stimulate constructive dialogue between the industry and its economic and social partners. It is essential reading for insurance academics and researchers, insurance industry executives and other professionals who are searching for a deeper insight into the strategic options for their sector. It bridges the gap between these groups, highlighting overlapping areas of interest and providing mutually beneficial research and dialogue.

'''''The Geneva Risk and Insurance Review'''''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.genevaassociation.org/publications/grir|title=The Geneva Review|work=genevaassociation.org|accessdate=4 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.palgrave-journals.com/grir/index.html|title=The Geneva Risk and Insurance Review|publisher=Palgrave-journals.com|accessdate=4 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
targets academics and university scholars in economics. The Review is published by Palgrave Macmillan in annual volumes of two issues. Its purpose is to support and encourage research in the economics of risk, uncertainty, insurance and related institutions by providing a forum for the scholarly exchange of findings and opinions.

'''Research reports, presentations and white papers''' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.genevaassociation.org/publications/reports,-presentations,-white-papers|title=Research reports, presentations, white papers|work=genevaassociation.org|accessdate=4 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Geneva Association publishes research on key issues such as financial stability and climate risk (e.g. ocean warming). It issues presentations in support of its research (e.g. a cross-industry benchmark study comparing the 28 banks designed as 'global systemically important' and 28 of the largest global insurers), while white papers are intended primarily to respond to draft policy papers presented for public consultation by regulatory bodies.

'''''The Geneva Reports''''' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.genevaassociation.org/publications/geneva-reports|title=The Geneva Reports|work=genevaassociation.org|accessdate=4 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Series tackles issues of strategic importance to the insurance industry that warrant special attention and particular analysis. The series is published on an “as appropriate basis” and is available both in printed and electronic versions. Topics covered have included the effects of climate change, disaster risk reduction, global ageing and retirement funding, and the credit crisis.

'''Newsletters''' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.genevaassociation.org/publications/newsletters|title=Newsletters|work=genevaassociation.org|accessdate=4 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Seven newsletters on the main research activities, as well as on World Fire Statistics, are published throughout the year. They are published biannually, except for Insurance and Finance and the World Fire Statistics. They are disseminated in hard copy and in the form of e-newsletters.

'''Conference Papers''' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.genevaassociation.org/publications/conference-papers|title=Conference papers|work=genevaassociation.org|accessdate=4 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
These are the working paper series of The Geneva Association. These documents present intermediary or final results of conference proceedings, special reports and research done by The Geneva Association. Most of these documents are available freely on The Geneva Association’s virtual library, except for those in restricted use, which remain in the private area.
The Geneva Association Working Paper Series ''Etudes et Dossiers'' appear at irregular intervals about 10-12 times per year. Distribution is limited. Hard copies are automatically sent to all of The Geneva Association’s members.

'''Books'''
The Geneva Association publishes books  in relation with its research programmes, such as reports on systemic risk and insurance, inter alia the seminal report on ''Systemic Risk in Insurance - An analysis of insurance and financial stability'' published in March 2010, and the book ''The Performance Economy'' republished end of 2010.

'''Horizons-1''', also known as '''Galaxy 13''', is a [[geostationary orbit|geostationary]] [[communications satellite]] operated by [[Intelsat]] and [[SKY Perfect JSAT Group]] (JSAT) which was designed and manufactured by [[Boeing Satellite Development Center|Boeing]] on the [[Boeing 601|BSS-601]]  platform. It has [[Ku band|K&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt; band]] and [[C band (IEEE)|C band]] payload and was used to replace [[Galaxy 9]] at the 127°West longitude.&lt;ref name=boeing-pr20010904horizon1 /&gt; It covers North America, Puerto Rico, Alaska, Hawaii and Mexico.&lt;ref name=satbeams-horizons1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=gsp-horizons1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=jsat-horizons1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=jsat-satellitefleet20160830 /&gt;

==Satellite description==
The spacecraft was designed and manufactured by [[Boeing Satellite Development Center|Boeing]] on the [[Boeing 601|BSS-601]] [[satellite bus]]. It had a launch mass of {{convert|4060|kg|abbr=on}} and a mass of {{convert|2630|kg|abbr=on}} at the beginning of its a 15-year design life.  When stowed for launch, it measured {{convert|5.7|m|abbr=on}} of height and {{convert|2.7|x|3.6|m|abbr=on}} on its sides. Its solar panels span {{convert|26.2|m|abbr=on}} when fully deployed and, with its antennas in fully extended configuration it is {{convert|7.0|m|abbr=on}} wide.&lt;ref name=boeingdefenseandspace-horizons1 /&gt;

It had two wings with four solar panels each that used [[Multi-junction solar cell|dual-junction]] [[Gallium arsenide|GsAs]] solar cells. Its power system generated 9.9&amp;nbsp;kW of power at beginning of life and 8.9&amp;nbsp;kW at the end of its design life and had a 30-cell [[Nickel–hydrogen battery|NiH]] battery for surviving solar eclipse.&lt;ref name=boeingdefenseandspace-horizons1 /&gt;

Its propulsion system was composed of an [[R-4D|R-4D-11-300]] [[Liquid Apogee Engine|LAE]] with a thrust of {{convert|490|N|abbr=on}}. It also used had 12 {{convert|22|N|abbr=on}} [[Bipropellant rocket|bipropellant]] [[Thrusters (spacecraft)|thrusters]] for [[Orbital station-keeping|station keeping]] and [[attitude dynamics and control|attitude control]]. For [[Orbital station-keeping#Station-keeping in geostationary orbit|North-South stationkeeping]], its primary method was an [[Electrically powered spacecraft propulsion|electric propulsion]] system with four [[XIPS|XIPS 13]], with four of the chemical thrusters acting as backup. It included enough propellant for [[Geostationary transfer orbit|orbit circularization]] and 15 years of operation.&lt;ref name=jsat-horizons1/&gt;&lt;ref name=boeingdefenseandspace-horizons1 /&gt;

It had two {{convert|107|in|m|order=flip|abbr=on}} [[Parabolic antenna#Types|Gregorian antennas]] and {{convert|50|in|m|order=flip|abbr=on}} two gridded shaped antennas.&lt;ref name=boeingdefenseandspace-horizons1 /&gt;

Its [[Ku band|K&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt; band]] payload is composed of twenty four active plus eight spares 36&amp;nbsp;MHz  [[Transponder (satellite communications)|transponders]] powered by [[Traveling-wave tube#Traveling-wave-tube amplifier|TWTA]] with an output power of 108&amp;nbsp;[[Watt]]s. It covers North America, Puerto Rico, Alaska, Hawaii and Mexico and is known as '''Horizons-1'''.&lt;ref name=jsat-horizons1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=boeingdefenseandspace-horizons1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=intelsat-horizons1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=jsat-book2012whoweare /&gt;&lt;ref name=panamsat-horizons1d2060312 /&gt;

The [[C band (IEEE)|C band]] payload had another twenty four plus eight spares 36&amp;nbsp;MHz transponders powered by 40&amp;nbsp;Watts TWTA. It covers North America, Puerto Rico, Alaska, Hawaii and Mexico and is known as '''Galaxy 13''', which was used to replace [[Galaxy 9]].&lt;ref name=boeingdefenseandspace-horizons1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=panamsat-galaxy13d2060312 /&gt;&lt;ref name=intelsat-galaxy13 /&gt;

==History==
'''Horizons Satellite''' was originally an equal share [[joint venture]] with [[PanAmSat]]. On September 4, 2001, it ordered from [[Boeing]] its first satellite, '''Horizons-1'''/'''Galaxy 13'''.&lt;ref name=boeing-pr20010904horizon1 /&gt; It was a {{convert|4|tonne|abbr=on}} spacecraft with 24 [[C band (IEEE)|C band]] and 24 [[Ku band|K&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt; band]] [[Transponder (satellite communications)|transponders]]. It had a 10&amp;nbsp;kW power generation capacity and 15 years of expected life.&lt;ref name=boeingdefenseandspace-horizons1 /&gt;

On the same day of the satellite order, Boeing disclosed that it had received an parallel contract from PanAmSat, where the latter had exercised an existing option to launch Horizons-1 from its [[Sea Launch]] subsidiary.&lt;ref name=boeing-pr20010904sealaunch /&gt;

It was successfully launched on October 1, 2003 at 4:03&amp;nbsp;UTC, aboard a [[Zenit-3SL]] rocket from the [[Odyssey (launch platform)|Ocean Odyssey]] platform sationed at the 154°W over the Equator in the Pacific Ocean.&lt;ref name=gsp-horizons1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=jsat-pr20031001 /&gt;

In late 2005 PanAmSat was taken over by [[Intelsat]] who continued the joint venture.

It is a member of the [[European Cyclists' Federation]], which focuses on daily utility cycling and the touring network [[EuroVelo]]. The Icelandic Cyclists' Federation was established in 1995, under the [[National Olympic and Sports Association of Iceland]] and its Sports for All project.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lhm.is/english Landssamtök hjólreiðamanna]&lt;/ref&gt; The official name is (in Icelandic), abbreviated LHM. It has its headquarters in [[Reykjavík]].

Two of the most active, and long-running cycling clubs in Iceland,  the [[Icelandic mountainbike club]], a club for touring and everyday cycling and the [[Cycling Club of Reykjavík]], which focuses on training and competitions are members of the federation.
Other members include the Cycling Club of Akureyri [[Hjólreiðafélag Akureyrar]] which work on various forms of sportive cycling as well as infrastructure and promotion for utility cycling, [[Hjólafærni á Íslandi]] which offers various services to further utility cycling and cycletouring on a not-for profit basis.  

== Related organisations ==
* In 2008 after the financial crash a Facebook group called [[Samtök um bíllausan lífsstíl]] (which translates to "The association for a car-free lifestyle"), was formed and then turned into an organisation with an elected board. There has been some co-operation and member overlap between the two. 
* In 2014 a separate Icelandic federation for sports cycling was formed, [[Hjólreiðasamband Íslands]], which is a formal affiliate  of the [[National Olympic and Sports Association of Iceland]].

'''Ilomba''' is a [[sea snake]] with destructive powers in the mythology of the [[Lozi people]] of [[Zambia]]. It is created by a [[witch doctor]]. It is made with their finger nails and blood from their forehead, back, and chest. They mix it in a pan with herbs that were considered to have a magical force. It is usually fed with eggs and porridge when it is young because its fangs are not fully developed. It takes on the identity of the person that owns it. The owner will command it to kill a person. The victim will see the witch doctor's face in place of the Ilomba's, but the other people will view it as a normal snake. It bites into its prey then consumes its soul. If it is killed, the owner feels the pain, and then dies. If the owner dies, it dies. If the witch doctor stops supplying food to it, it will turn on its master and consume them. The only way it can be destroyed is through the witch doctor. When the witch doctor does kill it, they will be constantly haunted by the souls that the Ilomba consumed.

[[File:Plain Aborigines Taipei.jpg|thumb|Ketagalan people]]

'''Ketagalan''' or '''Ketangalan''' ({{zh|c=凱達格蘭族|p=Kǎidágélán Zú}}) are a [[Taiwanese aborigines|Taiwanese aboriginal]] people originating in what is now the [[Taipei Basin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last =Lok-Sin | first =Loa | coauthors = | title =Ketagalan Aborigine intends to revisit Diaoyutai Islands for ancient ritual | newspaper =Taipei Times | location = | pages = | language = | publisher =| date =15 December 2012 | url =http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2012/12/15/2003550194 | accessdate =5 October 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Their [[Ketagalan language|language]] has now become extinct.

On 21 March 1996, the road in front of the [[Presidential Building (Taiwan)|Presidential Building]] was renamed from "Long Live [[Chiang Kai-shek]]" Road (介壽路) to [[Ketagalan Boulevard]] (凱達格蘭大道) by then-mayor of [[Taipei City]], [[Chen Shui-bian]], to commemorate the people. [[Traffic sign]]s banning [[motorcycle]]s and [[bicycle]]s from that road were abolished at the same time.

[[Beitou|Beitou District]] in Taipei City houses the [[Ketagalan Culture Center]], a cultural center about the Ketagalan people.

==Folklore==
Legend has it that the Ketagalan forebears originally lived on another island. One day, a [[monster]] appeared on the island. Every night it would appear in the village, terrorizing the villagers. Accordingly, the villagers laid traps for the monster all around their homes and fields. The wounded monster was forced back into the mountains and the village was peaceful again for a while, but soon afterward it reappeared. Pushed to insanity by hunger, the monster went into one of the village homes and killed a child. The villagers lived in fear of being eaten and did not dare to sleep. The villagers fiercely debated but nobody could think of a way to deal with the monster.

With no other choice, it was decided that they must pack up and leave the island. Following an arduous [[sea]] voyage, they sighted land. The island they landed on was [[Taiwan]]. Many years later, the community was growing so one day the villagers agreed to draw straws. Those who drew long straws were permitted to remain living on the fertile plain while those drawing the short straws would have to move into the [[mountain]]s. Thereafter, the villagers were separated into plain-dwelling and mountain-dwelling peoples.

'''General elections''' were held in [[Liechtenstein]] on 5 and 7 February 1982. The result was a victory for the [[Patriotic Union (Liechtenstein)|Patriotic Union]], which won 8 of the 15 seats in the [[Landtag of Liechtenstein|Landtag]]. Voter turnout was 95.4%, although only male citizens were allowed to vote.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ipu.org/parline-e/reports/arc/LIECHTENSTEIN_1982_E.PDF Liechtenstein] Inter-Parliamentary Union&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Nedjma''''' is a novel by [[Kateb Yacine]] published in 1956. It tells the story of four young men (Mustapha, Lakhdar, Rachid, Mourad) who fall in love with Nedjma, daughter of an Algerian and a French woman, during the French colonization of [[Algeria]]. It is set in the east of Algeria, with most of the action taking place in the region around [[Constantine, Algeria|Constantine]] and [[Annaba]] (referred to by its French name, Bône, in the text).

==Plot summary==
Although published in 1956, thus during the [[Algerian War|Algerian War of Independence]] which began in November 1954, it was largely written between 1947 and 1953, and the novel's political dimension applies specifically to this period rather than to the war itself. The central action of the novel takes place during the period following the nationalist demonstrations of 8 May 1945, which included the [[Setif massacre|Sétif massacre]]. Two of the characters in the novel, Lakhdar and Mustapha, were arrested, imprisoned and tortured following these demonstrations. The novel begins in the wake of the period of upheavals which followed the  demonstrations. The four male characters have found work on a building site, and one of them, Lakhdar, has been imprisoned following an altercation with M. Ernest, their (French) boss - an altercation which, however, due to the complex temporal structure of the novel, will not be related until later in the text. Shortly after this, still in the first part of the novel, another of the characters, Mourad, is involved in a brawl at a wedding which results in his being responsible for the death of M. Ricard, another French entrepreneur. This event causes the other characters to disperse, and from this point the novel changes in style and begins to recount their separate histories, jumping around considerably in its chronology.&lt;ref name="Bonn"&gt;[Charles BONN,''Kateb Yacine, Nedjma'', PUF, Literary Studies, 1990]&lt;/ref&gt; Each of the four male characters has a connection to, and is attracted to, Nedjma, who is the same age as the male characters but already (unhappily) married. Although based on a real person, with whom Yacine had a relationship, Nedjma (who rarely speaks in the novel and whose character is not developed) has frequently been identified with Algeria, "la femme-patrie".&lt;ref name="Carpentier"&gt;[see preface to Kateb Yacine, ''Nedjma'', foreword by [[Gilles Carpentier]], Paris, [[Editions du Seuil]], 1956]&lt;/ref&gt; The novel also evokes the history of the characters' tribe, the Keblout, and of [[Abdelkader El Djezairi|Abdelkader]]'s original resistance to French colonisation.

==Writing style==
Largely eschewing a simple 'realist' style, and written in a highly sophisticated French which at times passes into poetry, Nedjma has been compared stylistically with contemporary French works of the [[Nouveau Roman]] period, although Charles Bonn notes that [[William Faulkner]] was a much greater influence on Yacine than any of the [[Nouveau Roman]] writers. It has also been read as a response to [[Albert Camus]]' famous novel [[The Stranger (Camus novel)|L'Etranger]] which centres on the apparently irrational murder of an Algerian Arab by a French [[Pied-Noir]].&lt;ref name="Carpentier"/&gt;

The '''Tehran Symphony Orchestra''' ('''TSO''', {{lang-fa|ارکستر سمفونیک تهران}}), founded in 1933, is Iran's oldest and largest symphony orchestra. It was founded as the ''Municipality Symphony Orchestra'' by Gholamhossein Minbashian, before entering its modern form under [[Parviz Mahmoud]] in 1946. In the years that followed, conductors such as Rubik (Ruben) Gregorian, [[Morteza Hannaneh]], [[Haymo Taeuber]], [[Heshmat Sanjari]], and [[Farhad Meshkat]] took over as the conductors of the Orchestra.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070927192532/http://www.chnpress.com/news/?section=2&amp;id=6610 Another Look at the Tehran Symphony Orchestra’s Concert in Germany]&lt;/ref&gt;

After the 1979 revolution many musicians of the TSO emigrated to Europe and the US. For some years Heshmat Sanjari and then Fereydoun Nasseri were the conductors. The current conductor of TSO is Shardad Rohani

== 1933 - 1979 ==
In the golden age of the orchestra, many notable musicians like [[Yehudi Menuhin]] and [[Isaac Stern]] played with the orchestra.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iranhmusic.ir/article.aspx?id=1074 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-07-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100925075455/http://iranhmusic.ir/article.aspx?id=1074 |archivedate=2010-09-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== 1979 - present ==
After the 1979 [[Iranian revolution]] clerics outlawed all pre-revolutionary music, hardline clerics say music comes between the faithful and God, and leads to an impure mind.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cbc.ca/arts/music/story/2007/08/26/orchestra-exchange-iran.html&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the orchestra faced its darkest age, playing only a few concerts in the decade following the revolution. The pressure caused the conductor [[Heshmat Sanjari]] a serious sickness, he died in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bbc.co.uk/persian/arts/story/2005/01/041231_ag-mk-sanjeri.shtml&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;br&gt;
The orchestra still plays concerts once in a while.

It was the fifth of twelve [[GPS Block IIF|Block IIF]] satellites to be launched.&lt;ref name="GSP"/&gt;

== Launch ==
Built by [[Boeing]] and launched by [[United Launch Alliance]], USA-248 was launched at 01:59 UTC on 21 February 2014, atop a [[Delta IV]] carrier rocket, flight number D365, flying in the Medium+(4,2) configuration.&lt;ref name="LL"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://planet4589.org/space/log/launchlog.txt|title=Launch Log|publisher=Jonathan's Space Page|first=Jonathan|last=McDowell|accessdate=21 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The launch took place from [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station Space Launch Complex 37|Space Launch Complex 37B]] at the [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station]],&lt;ref name="lvdb"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://planet4589.org/space/lvdb/list2.html|title=Launch List|publisher=Jonathan's Space Page|work=Launch Vehicle Database|first=Jonathan|last=McDowell|accessdate=21 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and placed USA-248 directly into [[medium Earth orbit]].&lt;ref name="satcat"/&gt;

== Orbit ==
As of 22 April 2014, USA-248 was in an orbit with a [[apsis|perigee]] of {{convert|20175|km|sp=us}}, an [[apsis|apogee]] of {{convert|20191|km|sp=us}}, a [[orbital period|period]] of 717.99 minutes, and 54.96 degrees of [[inclination]] to the equator.&lt;ref name="satcat"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://planet4589.org/space/log/satcat.txt|title=Satellite Catalog|publisher=Jonathan's Space Page|first=Jonathan|last=McDowell|accessdate=21 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is used to broadcast the PRN 30 signal, and operates in slot 6 of plane A of the GPS constellation. The satellite has a design life of 15 years and a mass of {{convert|1630|kg}}.

'''WYFR''' was a [[shortwave]] [[radio station]] located in [[Okeechobee, Florida]], [[United States]]. The station was owned by Family Stations, Inc., as part of the [[Family Radio]] network, and used to broadcast traditional [[Christian radio]] programming to international audiences. WYFR ceased all shortwave transmissions July 1, 2013. In December 2013, another shortwave broadcaster, [[WRMI]] of [[Miami, Florida|Miami]], purchased the WYFR transmmission complex.

==History==
{{main|WNYW (shortwave)}}
WYFR was descended from W1XAL, an experimental shortwave station in that was granted its license in 1927 and broadcast from [[Boston]] until 1936 when the station moved to Scituate, Massachusetts. In 1939 the call letters were changed to WRUL and initially served as an educational station broadcasting university lectures. During [[World War II]] it became a propaganda station and was leased by the US government from 1942 until the end of the war. The station became [[WNYW (shortwave)|WNYW]] in 1966.

In 1973, it was purchased by Family Stations, Inc, and began broadcasting as WYFR on October 20, 1973. The call sign stands for '''W'''e're '''Y'''our '''F'''amily '''R'''adio.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} The station built new transmitters in Okeechobee, Florida in 1977,{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} and closed the Scituate site in 1979.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} In mid-2013 Family Radio announced it would be permanently closing WYFR on June 30, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;http://mt-shortwave.blogspot.com/2013/06/wyfr-to-close-all-shortwave-services.html&lt;/ref&gt;   The station did in fact close but was purchased by [[WRMI]] and brought back to the air in December 2013.

The [[interval signal]] of WYFR was a brass quintet playing the first eight bars of "To God Be the Glory".{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

==Radio Taiwan International==
At night after 5 p.m./6 p.m. until sometime the next morning [[Eastern Time Zone]] (depending on [[daylight saving time]]), WYFR broadcast [[Radio Taiwan International]] in [[English language|English]], [[Standard Mandarin|Mandarin]], [[Standard Chinese|Cantonese]], [[Hakka Chinese|Hakka]], and [[Spanish language|Spanish]]. As Radio Taiwan International leased broadcast time on WYFR from Family Radio, these broadcasts also ended on July 1, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://english.rti.org.tw/thmeInfo4.aspx?tid=84557129E1CDFAD2 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2013-06-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202235524/http://english.rti.org.tw/thmeInfo4.aspx?tid=84557129E1CDFAD2 |archive-date=2013-12-02 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Family Radio, however, continued to host RTI's audio service to the Chinese community in the [[New York City]] area on a digital subchannel of Family Radio's television station, [[WNYJ-TV]], until that station ceased operations on October 25, 2017.

[[File:Westray to Papa Westray air route map.png|thumb|The flight goes between two islands in Orkney, Scotland: Westray and Papa Westray. At {{convert|1.7|mi|km|order=flip}}, it is the shortest scheduled airline flight in the world as of December, 2016.]]
The '''Loganair Westray to Papa Westray route''' is the shortest scheduled passenger flight in the world. Flights on this route are scheduled for one and a half minutes, and actual flying time is closer to one minute. The record for the fastest flight is 53 seconds. The route is flown by [[Loganair]], a Scottish [[regional airline]] that serves Scotland's Highlands and islands.

==Background==
The route between the [[Orkney|Orkney Islands]] of [[Westray]] and [[Papa Westray]] in northern [[United Kingdom]] is a subsidized [[public service obligation]]. The [[Orkney Islands Council]] awards the route, along with several other routes throughout the islands, through a tendering process. The flights began in 1967, establishing the record for the world's shortest scheduled flights, and they have been continuously operated by [[Loganair]].&lt;ref name=DM01&gt;{{cite news|last1=Johnson|first1=Sarah|title=Right to operate world's shortest scheduled flight at just 47 seconds sparks bidding war between aviation firms|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2260352/Right-operate-worlds-shortest-scheduled-flight-just-47-seconds-sparks-bidding-war-aviation-firms.html|accessdate=21 January 2016|agency=Daily Mail|date=10 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, the contract was again awarded to Loganair over two competing bids.&lt;ref name=OIC01&gt;{{cite web|last1=Orkney Islands Council|title=Loganair awarded North Isles air service contract|url=http://www.orkney.gov.uk/OIC-News/loganair-awarded-north-isles-air-service-contract.htm|website=Orkney Islands Council News|accessdate=24 January 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160131060054/http://www.orkney.gov.uk/OIC-News/loganair-awarded-north-isles-air-service-contract.htm#|archive-date=31 January 2016|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Flights==

Flights between [[Westray Airport]] and [[Papa Westray Airport]] occur daily in both directions, except on Saturdays, when only flights from Westray to Papa Westray are available, and on Sunday, when only flights from Papa Westray to Westray are available.&lt;ref name=Loganair02&gt;{{cite web|last1=Loganair|title=Timetable from 25 October 2015 to 28 February 2016|url=http://www.loganair.co.uk/xtra_files/OrkneyWinter25Oct15-28Feb16.pdf|website=Loganair Orkney Inter-Isles Air Services|accessdate=21 January 2016}}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Loganair01&gt;{{cite web|last1=Loganair|title=Timetable from 29 February to 29 October 2016|url=http://www.loganair.co.uk/xtra_files/OrkneySummer29Feb16-29Oct16.pdf|website=Loganair Orkney Inter-Isles Air Services|accessdate=21 January 2016}}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The total distance covered by the flights is {{convert|1.7|mi|km|order=flip}}, which is about the same length as the runway at [[Edinburgh airport]].&lt;ref name=BBC01&gt;{{cite news|last1=BBC News|title=Final trip for Orkney shortest flight pilot|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-north-east-orkney-shetland-22668150|accessdate=21 January 2016|agency=BBC News|date=26 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The flights are always combined with flights from and to [[Kirkwall Airport]] ({{convert|44|km|mi|abbr=on}} distance), flying in a narrow triangle.&lt;ref name=loganair_interorkney&gt;[https://www.loganair.co.uk/travel-information/orkney-inter-island-services/ Orkney Inter Island Flights]&lt;/ref&gt;

Pilot Stuart Linklater flew the short hop a record more than 12,000 times, more than any other pilot, before he retired in 2013. Linklater set the record for the fastest flight between the islands at 53 seconds.&lt;ref name=BBC01 /&gt;

===Passengers===

[[File:Knap of Howar 02.jpg|thumb|Archaeological site in Papa Westray, Scotland: The [[Knap of Howar]] is possibly the oldest stone house in Northern Europe.]]
Many students and their teachers take these flights to study the 60 archaeological sites on Papa Westray, making up the majority of passengers. Occasionally health professionals are needed to assist one of the island's 90 residents, and patients will also take the flight from Papa Westray to medical facilities when needed. The flight has also become popular among tourists.&lt;ref name=DM01 /&gt;&lt;ref name=FC01&gt;{{cite web|last1=Clarke|first1=Chris|title=The World's Shortest Commercial Flight Takes Less Than A Minute|url=http://flightclub.jalopnik.com/the-worlds-shortest-commercial-flight-takes-less-than-a-1697446932|website=Flight Club|accessdate=21 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aircraft===
Loganair operates this flight with one of its two [[Britten-Norman BN-2 Islander|Pilatus Britten-Norman BN2B-26 Islander]] aircraft. The Islander is a high-wing, twin piston engine, propeller-driven aircraft. It is flown by a single pilot, and there is seating for eight passengers in the passenger cabin. One additional seat usually remains empty next to the pilot.

Loganair's chief executive, Jim Cameron, described the Islander as "robust" and "well suited to the vagaries of Scottish weather".&lt;ref name=Guardian01&gt;{{cite news|last1=Seenan|first=Gerard|title=Inquiry into crash of air ambulance|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2005/mar/16/scotland|accessdate=31 December 2015|agency=The Guardian|date=15 May 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Summarizing expert opinion of the Islander, Alastair Dalton of ''The Scotsman'' said the aircraft "had a good safety record and had proved versatile in operating from the shortest and roughest Highland runways".&lt;ref name=Scotsman01&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dalton|first1=Alastair|title=Family's tribute to pilot and paramedic lost in crash|url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/family-s-tribute-to-pilot-and-paramedic-lost-in-crash-1-739757|accessdate=31 December 2015|work=The Scotsman|date=16 March 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Loganair is planning to introduce electric aircraft to the Orkney Islands by 2021 due to the short distance between the islands that would make such flights possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-north-east-orkney-shetland-45876604|title=Orkney islands could get first electric plane service|accessdate=18 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Flight numbers===
The flight numbers change daily and repeat with a weekly cycle. Loganair Flight 312 departs from [[Westray Airport]] to [[Papa Westray Airport]] on Monday morning, and Flight 317 returns to Westray that afternoon. On Tuesdays through Fridays, the flight numbers to Papa Westray are 323, 333, 343, and 353. The return flight numbers are 328, 338, 348, and 358. Flight 362 or 363 is the Saturday flight from Westray to Papa Westray, and on Sundays, Flight 378 is the return flight to Westray.&lt;ref name=Loganair01 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Loganair02 /&gt;

===Possible replacement===
In 2014 Orkney Islands Council began [[British Isles fixed sea link connections#Other proposed fixed sea links within or to the British Isles .26 associated areas|consultations]] to build a number of fixed links between seven of the Orkney Islands. This would include a bridge between Westray and Papa Westray.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.scotsman.com/news/transport/orkney-bridge-plan-may-end-world-s-shortest-flight-1-3443317&lt;/ref&gt;

There are car ferries between the islands also, usually 13 daily departures per direction. They are around 5&amp;nbsp;km and last around 25 minutes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.orkneyferries.co.uk/timetables.php Published Timetables] (Orkney Ferries)&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Çarşı Hamam''' ({{lang-el|Τσαρσί Χαμάμ}}, in [[Turkish language|Turkish]] meaning "market bath") is an [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] [[Turkish bath|bath]] (''hamam'') in the town of [[Mytilene]] in [[Lesbos]], [[Greece]]. 

It was probably built in the first quarter of the 19th century, and formed part of the nearby [[Yeni Mosque, Mytilene|Yeni ("New") Mosque]] complex.&lt;ref name="odysseus"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://odysseus.culture.gr/h/2/gh251.jsp?obj_id=15721 | title = Τσαρσί Χαμάμ | language = Greek | publisher = Hellenic Ministry of Culture | last = Loupou | first = Athina-Christina | accessdate = 14 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; As its name indicates, it was the main market bath for the local neighbourhood. Its layout follows the typical three-part procession from cold to warm found in Ottoman and Roman baths. The bath underwent a restoration in 2000–2001 and continues to be open to the public.&lt;ref name="odysseus"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1533">[[Image:Evolene Cow.jpg|thumb|A grazing Évolène cow at [[Ballenberg]], [[Switzerland]].]]
'''Évolène Cattle''' are an old breed of [[dairy cattle]] from the [[Valais]] [[canton (country subdivision)|canton]] of [[Switzerland]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ansi.okstate.edu/breeds/cattle/evolene/index.htm Oklahoma State University cattle breeds]&lt;/ref&gt; It is an endangered cattle breed.

== Characteristics ==
The Évolène is a medium-sized, black pied or red pied breed, used more for beef production than milk production. Similar to the [[Herens (cattle)|Herens]], the Évolènes have a milk production of about 3,200&amp;nbsp;kg milk per year. Its fat content is about 3.8%. The breed is adapted to mountain pasture.  

Similar to [[Pinzgau Cattle]], the white parts of the fur are mostly on the back and the abdomen. The cattle are very muscular, with noticeable neck muscles in the females. Évolènes have short, strong legs and a short, broad head. The horns are very strong and exceptionally long. The height of bulls is about 130&amp;nbsp;cm, the weight 600 to 700&amp;nbsp;kg. Cows are smaller; they are only 115 to 125&amp;nbsp;cm high and weigh between 400 and 500&amp;nbsp;kg.  

Similar to the [[Tux Cattle]] and the [[Herens (cattle)|Herens]], Évolène females are very aggressive, with cows fighting for their ranking in very long fights.
