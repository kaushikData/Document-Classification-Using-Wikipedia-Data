He was first elected in [[Luxembourgian legislative election, 1999|1999]], but lost his seat in the [[Luxembourgian legislative election, 2004|2004 election]], in which the DP fared poorly.  He returned to the Chamber on 10 October 2006,&lt;ref name="Chamber" /&gt; replacing [[Niki Bettendorf]] upon Bettendorf's resignation.

Krieps was born in [[Guildford]], [[Surrey]], when his father, fellow politician and [[Resistance during World War II|resistance]] leader [[Émile Krieps]], was posted in the [[United Kingdom]] in the aftermath the [[World War II|Second World War]].

He is currently President of the [[Luxembourg Rugby Federation]], a position that he had previously held from 1985 to 1992.  He is a [[general practitioner]] by trade.&lt;ref name="Chamber" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2827">The '''American Board of Obstetrics and Gynecology''' (abbreviated '''ABOG''') is a non-profit organization that provides [[board certification]] for practicing [[obstetrician]]s and [[gynecologist]]s in [[the United States]] and [[Canada]]. It was founded in 1927 and is based in [[Dallas]], [[Texas]]. It is one of 24 [[medical board]]s recognized by the [[American Board of Medical Specialties]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite press release |title=ABOG Launches Focus 20/20-Practice Analysis |date=2018-01-16 |publisher=American Board of Obstetrics and Gynecology |url=https://www.abog.org/training-resources/news-updates-for-prog-admins-fellows-residents/2018/06/26/abog-launches-focus-20-20-practice-analysis |language=en |access-date=2018-12-01 |website=CMS}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The board was the center of controversy in 2013, when it issued a directive requiring its certified [[OB-GYN]]s to not treat male patients in order to retain their certification. This directive allowed OB-GYNs to treat men only in a small number of situations, such as if the man was involved in "active government service" or was undergoing a [[fertility]] evaluation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://slate.com/human-interest/2013/11/the-american-board-of-obstetrics-and-gynecology-cracks-down-on-ob-gyns-treating-male-patients.html |title=Should Gynecologists Be Allowed to Treat Men?

'''Apex location''' is a method of determining the length of the [[root canal]] of a [[tooth]] - manually or with a mechanical canal instrument that passes a low intensity electric current through the tooth.{{Citation needed|date= February 2018}}

The electrical characteristics of the tooth structure are measured and the exact position of the instrument in the tooth is determined. When the tool tip touches the top of the tooth, the instrument signals that the [[apical foramen]] is reached.{{Citation needed|date= February 2018}} Whenever the channel instrument is pulled out its length can be measured to determine the depth of the root canal and all other dental tools can be adjusted to this length.{{Citation needed|date= February 2018}}

== Methods of measurement ==
===Method of Sonada===
The method of Sonada measures the canal's [[Electrical impedance|impedance]] using one or more electric frequencies. The method tracks the penetration of the instrument in the canal.{{Citation needed|date= February 2018}} It is unreliable though in the presence of fluid in the canal which requires additional drying.{{Cit{{Citation needed|date= February 2018}}ation needed|date= February 2018}}

===Method of Kobayashi===
The method of Kobayashi performs a calculation of the ratio of the measured impedance of two or more electric frequencies. The method is highly accurate in the presence of fluid in the root canal. The method does not provide good monitoring of the penetration before reaching the apex. This method faces difficulties when working in a dry canal. Therefore the canal should be moistened. After measurement the canal should be dried.{{Citation needed|date= February 2018}}

===Adaptive method===
The Adaptive method of measurement is implemented by the so-called [[electronic apex locator]].{{Citation needed|date= February 2018}} In the process of penetrating the instrument makes continuous measurements and selects a suitable method of measurement. In case of dry canal the device uses the method of Sonada. In case of wet canal the device automatically adjusts the measurement method of Kobayashi. The adaptive method is highly accurate and does not require moistening or drying the canal.{{Citation needed|date= February 2018}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5263">[[File:Attributable fraction for the population.svg|alt=Illustration of the population, with a part exposed to a risk factor. (AFp = 1/9).|thumb|A quarter of the population is exposed to a risk factor (radiation hazard sign) and has a higher risk of an adverse outcome (black). In the whole population, one ninth of the adverse outcomes can be attributed to the exposure (AF&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; = 1/9).]]
In [[epidemiology]], '''attributable fraction for the population (AFp)''' is the proportion of incidents in the population that are attributable to the risk factor. Term '''attributable risk percent for the population''' is used if the fraction is expressed as a percentage.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780199976720.001.0001/acref-9780199976720|title=Dictionary of Epidemiology - Oxford Reference|language=en|doi=10.1093/acref/9780199976720.001.0001|access-date=2018-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is calculated as &lt;math&gt;AF_p = (I_p - I_u)/I_p&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;I_p&lt;/math&gt; is the incidence in the population, and &lt;math&gt;I_u&lt;/math&gt; is the incidence in the unexposed group.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Equivalently it can be calculated as &lt;math&gt;AF_p = \frac{P_e(RR - 1)}{1 + P_e(RR-1)}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;P_e&lt;/math&gt;is the exposed proportion of the population and &lt;math&gt;RR&lt;/math&gt; is the [[relative risk]] not adjusted for [[Confounding|confounders]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite book | url = https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/646751070 | title = Statistical methods in medical research | vauthors = Armitage P, Berry G, Matthews JN | date = 2002 | publisher = Blackwell Scientific Publications | year = 2002 | isbn = 978-0-470-77366-6 | edition = 4th | location = Oxford | pages = 682 | oclc = 646751070 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is used when an exposure increases the risk, as opposed to reducing it, in which case its symmetrical notion is [[preventable fraction for the population]].

== Synonyms ==
Multiple synonyms of the attributable fraction for the population are in use: attributable proportion for the population&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;, population attributable proportion&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;, Levin's attributable risk,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; population attributable risk,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; population attributable fraction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rockhill B, Newman B, Weinberg C | title = Use and misuse of population attributable fractions | journal = American Journal of Public Health | volume = 88 | issue = 1 | pages = 15–9 | date = January 1998 | pmid = 9584027 | pmc = 1508384 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.who.int/healthinfo/global_burden_disease/metrics_paf/en/ | title = Metrics: Population Attributable Fraction (PAF)| publisher = World Health Organization | access-date=2018-05-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, population attributable risk percent (PAR) is used as a synonym for the attributable risk percent for the population.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid51604333"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cole P, MacMahon B | title = Attributable risk percent in case-control studies | journal = British Journal of Preventive &amp; Social Medicine | volume = 25 | issue = 4 | pages = 242–4 | date = November 1971 | pmid = 5160433 | pmc = 478665 | doi =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Interpretation ==
Attributable fraction for the population combines both the relative risk of an incident with respect to the factor, as well as the prevalence of the factor in the population. Values of AF&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; close to 1 indicate that both the relative risk is high, and that the risk factor is prevalent. In such case, removal of the risk factor will greatly reduce the number of the incidents in the population. The values of AF&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; close to 0, on the other hand, indicate that either the relative risk is low, or that the factor is not prevalent (or both). Removal of such factor from the population will have little effect. Because of this interpretation, the AFp is well suited for the public policy making.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Northridge ME|date=September 1995|title=Public health methods--attributable risk as a link between causality and public health action|journal=American Journal of Public Health|volume=85|issue=9|pages=1202–4|pmc=1615585|pmid=7661224}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, in 1953 Levin's paper it was estimated that lung cancer has relative risk of 3.6 - 13.4 in smokers compared to non-smokers, and that the proportion of the population exposed to smoking was 0.5 - 0.96, resulting in the high value of attributable fraction for the population 0.56 - 0.92.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; 

== Generalizations ==
Attributable fraction for the population can be generalized to the case where the multilevel exposure to the risk factor. In such case

&lt;math&gt;AF_p = \frac{\sum_i P_i RR_r - \sum_i P_i'RR_i}{\sum_i P_i RR_i}&lt;/math&gt;where &lt;math&gt;P_i&lt;/math&gt;is the proportion of the population exposed to the level &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;,  &lt;math&gt;P_i'&lt;/math&gt;is the desired (ideal) proportion of the population exposed to the level &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;RR_i&lt;/math&gt;is the relative risk at exposure level &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

[[File:Backwashing in a water filtration plant.JPG|thumb|Backwashing cycle is run on the left filter of the test columns in a [[water filtration plant]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bungay's lecture on sand filtration|url=http://www.rpi.edu/dept/chem-eng/Biotech-Environ/FILTRATION/sand.htm|website=Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute|accessdate=26 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
In terms of [[water treatment]], including [[water purification]] and [[sewage treatment]], '''backwashing''' refers to pumping water backwards through the [[filter (water)|filters]] media, sometimes including intermittent use of [[compressed air]] during the process. Backwashing is a form of [[preventive maintenance]] so that the filter media can be reused. In water treatment plants, backwashing can be an automated process that is run by local [[programmable logic controller]]s (PLCs). The backwash cycle is triggered after a set time interval, when the filter effluent turbidity is greater than a treatment guideline or when the differential [[pressure]] ([[head loss]]) across the filter exceeds a set value.

Water treatment filters that can be backwashed include [[rapid sand filter]]s, pressure filters and  [[carbon filtering|granular activated carbon (GAC) filters]]. [[Diatomaceous earth]] filters are backwashed according to the proprietary arrangement of pumps, valves and filters associated with the filtration system.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.poolcenter.com/de-pool-filter-information.html Diatomaceous Earth Pool Filters] Accessed 2012-06-20.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Slow sand filters]] and self-cleaning [[screen filter]]s employ mechanisms other than backwashing to remove trapped particles. To keep water treatment filters functional, they have to be cleaned periodically to remove particulates. Ineffective backwashing is one of the main reasons that water treatment filters fail.

==Procedure==

Backwashing of granular media filters involves several steps. First, the filter is taken off line and the water is drained to a level that is above the surface of the filter bed. Next, compressed air is pushed up through the filter material causing the filter bed to expand breaking up the compacted filter bed and forcing the accumulated particles into [[suspension (chemistry)|suspension]]. After the air scour cycle, clean backwash water is forced upwards through the filter bed continuing the filter bed expansion and carrying the particles in suspension into backwash troughs suspended above the filter surface. In some applications, air and water streams are simultaneously pushed upwards through the granular media followed by a rinse water wash.&lt;ref name=Kawamura/&gt;{{rp|213–4}} Backwashing continues for a fixed time, or until the [[turbidity]] of the backwash water is below an established value. At the end of the backwash cycle, the upward flow of water is terminated and the filter bed settles by gravity into its initial configuration.  Water to be filtered is then applied to the filter surface until the filter clogs and the backwash cycle needs to be repeated.&lt;ref name=Kawamura&gt;Kawamura, Susumu. (2000).

Some water treatment filters use surface wash systems that break up the heavily clogged, granular media surface layer.  Surface wash systems are buried in the top of the filter media or are suspended above the filter media surface. [[John R. Baylis]] developed a fixed grid system which consisted of pipes with nozzles that injected jets of water into the filter material during expansion.&lt;ref&gt;Baylis, John R. (1959). "Review of Filter Bed Design and Methods of Washing." ''Journal AWWA.'' 51:11 1433-54.&lt;/ref&gt; Rotating arms use jets of water to break up the clogged filter surface and to rotate a movable arm through the filter material. A surface wash step in a backwash cycle usually takes place at the beginning of the filter bed cleaning process.&lt;ref name=Kawamura/&gt;{{rp|199–200}}&lt;ref name=Culp /&gt;{{rp|357–60}}

==Treatment==

Spent backwash water is either discharged without treatment to a sanitary sewer system or is treated and recycled within the plant.&lt;ref name=Edzwald /&gt;{{rp|22.37-22.40}}  Historically, backwash water was discharged directly to surface water supplies;  however, direct discharge is now highly regulated through [[NPDES]] discharge permits and is often discouraged.  Used backwash water contains high concentrations of particulate material.  Typical treatment processes include [[Coagulation (water treatment)|coagulation]], [[flocculation]] and [[sedimentation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Basic Chemistry of Water &amp; Analysis|url=https://watertreatmentservices.co.uk/water/basic-chemistry-water-treatment-training/|publisher=Watertreatmentservices.co.uk|accessdate=13 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; High molecular weight synthetic organic polymers are sometimes added to facilitate the formation of settleable [[flocculation|floc]]. Failure of a backwash treatment process and reintroduction of the resulting poor quality water into the main water purification plant flow stream can cause overall process upsets and result in the production of poor quality treated drinking water.&lt;ref name=Baruth /&gt;{{rp|20.11–20.13}}

==Recycling==

As a water conservation measure, many [[water purification]] plants recycle filter backwash water and other product streams from sludge treatment processes back to the beginning of the plant.&lt;ref name=Edzwald /&gt;{{rp|22.40-22.43}}&lt;ref name=Crittenden/&gt;{{rp|242–3}} On June 8, 2001, the USEPA released a final regulation governing acceptable practices for recycling backwash water.&lt;ref&gt;[http://water.epa.gov/lawsregs/rulesregs/sdwa/mdbp/upload/2001_06_08_mdbp_fr-fbr.pdf National Primary Drinking Water Regulations: Filter Backwash Recycling Rule] Federal Register. 66:111 June 8, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;  The purpose of the regulation was to improve the control of microbial contaminants such as ''[[Cryptosporidium]]'' by reducing the potential for recycled product streams to upset the removal efficiency of the main treatment processes.  The regulation requires that spent filter backwash water be recycled to the front of the treatment plant so that all available particle removal treatment processes can be employed to remove the microbial and particulate material from the backwash water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Filter Backwash Recycling Rule|url=http://water.epa.gov/lawsregs/rulesregs/sdwa/filterbackwash.cfm|publisher=Water.epa.gov|accessdate=13 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Berman Medical Library was founded in 1919 with great help of Dr. Julius Jarcho, a consulting gynecologist of [[Mount Sinai Beth Israel|Beth Israel]] and [[Sydenham Hospital]]s.  In 1930 the library was named in his honour, ''The Dr. Julius Jarcho Medical Library.''&lt;ref name="NamedJarcho"&gt;{{cite news|title=204 Students Now Attending Hebrew University; Medical Library Named for Jarcho|url=http://archive.jta.org/1930/12/28/archive/204-students-now-attending-hebrew-university-medical-library-named-for-jarcho|accessdate=18 January 2017|publisher=[[Jewish Telegraphic Agency]]|date=28 December 1930}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HonorJarcho"&gt;{{cite news|title=Pays Honor to Dr. Jarcho; University In Jerusalem Gives His Name to Library He Aided|publisher=[[New York Times]]|date=28 December 1930}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early days the library served as the central medical library in Israel, with branches across the country. In 1966 the Library merged with the Hadassah Medical Center. In 1975 the library moved to its current building, donated by [https://www.lehigh.edu/library/speccoll/berman.html Muriel and Philip Berman] of [[Allentown, Pennsylvania]].  Since about 2000 the library has also included a medical history museum. Since 2003 the library has been administratively incorporated in the [http://lib-authority.huji.ac.il/ University Library Authority].

Dr. Siegfried Plaschkes was the creator of the medical history museum. The Museum was transferred to the Berman Medical Library at the beginning of the millennium. It contains collections of Hebrew amulets, medals, ex-libris, medical stamps, a number of ancient instruments, and more.&lt;ref name="SiegelItzkovich"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Siegel-Itzkovich|first1=Judy|title=Combining old and new to teach medical students|url=http://www.jpost.com/Business-and-Innovation/Health-and-Science/Combining-old-and-new-to-teach-medical-students-407335|accessdate=18 January 2017|publisher=[[Jerusalem Post]]|date=28 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HonorBermans"&gt;{{cite news|title=HEBREW UNIVERSITY TO HONOR BERMANS AS 'FRIENDS OF ISRAEL'|url=http://articles.mcall.com/1984-10-24/news/2447821_1_mrs-berman-scopus-award-hebrew-university|accessdate=18 January 2017|publisher=[[The Morning Call]]|date=24 October 1984}}&lt;/ref&gt; The collection of [http://www.jpost.com/Business-and-Innovation/Health-and-Science/Combining-old-and-new-to-teach-medical-students-407335 historical works and literature] is the most significant in the country.

'''''Birth as an American Rite of Passage''''' is a book written by [[Robbie Davis-Floyd]] and published in 1992. It combines anthropology and first-hand accounts from mothers and doctors into a critical analysis of childbirth in America from a [[Feminism|feminist]] perspective. 

It introduces the theme of technocratic medicine as a form of indoctrination into America's [[patriarchal]] culture. Davis-Floyd argues that American birthing practices value science over nature, a doctor's knowledge over that of the mother and that many common actions performed by doctors (or the mother) are [[technocratic]] rituals – behaviors with limited practical purpose. She cites practices such as  obstructing the mother's line of sight to the baby exiting her body by placing a sheet over her lower body. Davis-Floyd believes that society, intimidated by women's ability to give birth, has designed unnecessary rituals in order to make the symbolism of childbirth available to everyone, not just those who can bear children. "In this way," she writes, "society symbolically demonstrates ownership of its product."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Birth as an American Rite of Passage|last=Davis-Floyd|first=Robbie|publisher=University of California Press|year=1992|isbn=9780520074392|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Key concepts ==
===Technology in birth===
Major life transitions are often [[Ritualization|ritualized]] in a way that is local to a particular society or culture.&lt;ref&gt;Davis-Floyd, Robbie. "The Rituals of American Hospital Birth," ‘’Conformity and Conflict: Readings in Cultural Anthropology’’ (1994) pp 1-20. [http://www.davis-floyd.com/the-rituals-of-american-hospital-birth/]&lt;/ref&gt; Pregnancy and childbirth are processes that reflect the traditions, beliefs, and values of the culture in which they take place.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Julia W. Buckey|first=George A. Jacinto|year=2013|title=Birth: A Rite of Passage|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/George_Jacinto/publication/270571428_Birth_A_Rite_of_Passage/links/56a256a508ae232fb2019b18.pdf|journal=International Journal of Childbirth Education|volume=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Davis-Floyd argues that the emphasis on technological advances that aid pregnancy, create a negative effect surrounding its [[ideology]]. The book argues that American society values the knowledge of medical professionals over that of mothers and [[Midwife|midwives]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Childbirth_and_Authoritative_Knowledge.html?id=qo-1ngEACAAJ|title=Childbirth and Authoritative Knowledge: Cross-cultural Perspectives|last=Davis-Floyd|first=Robbie|last2=Sargent|first2=Carolyn Fishel|date=1997-01-01|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=9780520207851|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Davis-Floyd's model criticizes current [[Obstetrics and gynaecology|tocology]] and childbirth as overly scientific, technology-motivated methods that can serve to disempower women. Certain medical procedures such as a [[Caesarean section|cesarean section]], [[episiotomy]], and the positioning of the woman at the time of birth, are viewed as optimal in American birthing culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|jstor=10.1525/j.ctt1ppszz|title=Birth Models That Work|last=Davis-Floyd|first=Robbie|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Davis-Floyd argues that these procedures are mainly a result of cultural beliefs, and not for their actual benefits. The same is true of the perception that pregnancy and childbirth require medical oversight and interference. Davis-Floyd claims that the majority of women's favorable views of technological intervention during childbirth are due to doctors' influence. Obstetric procedures act as rituals for pregnant women and medical personnel, with the intention of improving the attitudes of those involved in birthing. For example, when fluids are administered through [[intravenous therapy]], a feeling of security is invoked; a reassuring order is imposed on the event, reinforcing reliance upon others' knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.davis-floyd.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Davis-Floyd-1994-The-Technocratic-Body-American-Childbirth-as-Cultural-Expression.pdf|title=The Technocratic Body: American Childbirth as Cultural Expression|last=Davis-Floyd|first=Robbie|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.stthomasu.ca/~parkhill/rite101/ireps/floyd.htm|title=Medicalization of Birth|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Intuition as Authoritative Knowledge in Midwifery and Home birth|last=Davis-Floyd|first=Robbie|date=|website=|jstor=649330|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rite of passage===
The concept of a [[rite of passage]] was coined by [[Ethnography|ethnographer]] [[Arnold van Gennep]].{{cn|date=May 2018}} Davis-Floyd states that birth as a rite of passage incorporates three essential stages. Through birth, the treatment of the woman's body, and the doctor's implementation of procedures, the rite is enacted within American culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/faculty/browner/publications/brownerpress1996.pdf|title=The Production of Authoritative Knowledge in American Prenatal Care|last=Press|first=Nancy|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stages===
The three stages are separation, [[liminality|pregnancy]] and reincorporation. These three stages characterize the rite of passage and are culturally relative to the society within which they function. In some cases four stages apply, and in rare cases, up to ten. However, such cases have never been recorded.{{Clarify|reason=how can they be said to exist if they have not been recorded?|date=May 2018}}

'''Separation''': A phase during which the pregnant woman begins to form a new self-identity as a result of her pregnancy. She separates from her original state of being. In this stage, the woman is now an "other", unlike her old self.

'''Pregnancy''': A phase where the pregnant woman is "in between". She is neither a normal member of society nor a mother. This stage continues until after the birth.

'''Integration''': The woman accepts her new social identity. This phase ends when the woman feels that she is similar to her previous self.

== Reception ==
Reviews of this book praised Davis-Floyd for connecting American childbirth with rituals using an anthropological basis. The book also received criticism for basing its conclusions on interviews with only 100 women who were all well-educated, middle-class and [[Caucasian race|Caucasian]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Birth as an American Rite of Passage Review|last=Phillips|first=Virginia|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The lives of their 13,500 children are being tracked through research studies and the use of routinely collected medical and educational data.

==Background==
Bradford has some of the highest rates of childhood illness in the UK. Born in Bradford is helping to unravel the reasons for this ill health and bring new scientific discovery to the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.borninbradford.nhs.uk/news/| title=Born in Bradford News|date=2013-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also providing a catalyst for communities to work with the NHS and local authority to improve child health and wellbeing in the city. Examples of the success of Born in Bradford in changing practice include: the establishment of a Yorkshire wide congenital anomalies register, the first trust in the UK to provide gestational diabetes screening for all pregnant women in the district, improvement in vitamin D supplementation in high risk mothers, rapid implementation of [[NICE]] guidelines in midwifery practice, improved detection of childhood obesity by health visitors, and development of a simple mobile phone app to help parents and health professionals monitor children's weight.

Born in Bradford will continue to follow children until they are adults, and help doctors to understand more about the big health challenges of the 21st century such as heart disease, mental health and cancer. This is a study that has the potential to promote real change at a local level and also to make major contributions to global knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.borninbradford.nhs.uk/research-scientific/bib-scientific-publications/| title=Born in Bradford Scientific Publications|date=2013-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''CBC Bank''' is a heritage-listed former bank building at 16-20 Manning Street, [[Kiama, New South Wales|Kiama]], [[Municipality of Kiama]], [[New South Wales]], Australia. It was designed by Mansfield Bros and built by White and Coghill in 1880. It was added to the [[New South Wales State Heritage Register]] on 2 April 1999.&lt;ref name=nswshr-143&gt;{{cite NSW SHR|5045696|CBC Bank (former)|hr=00143|fn=S90/05746 &amp; HC 32558|accessdate=1 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=local&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article113841533 |title=LOCAL INTELLIGENCE. |newspaper=[[The Kiama Independent, And Shoalhaven Advertiser]] |volume=XVIII, |issue=1,110 |location=New South Wales, Australia |date=20 August 1880 |accessdate=20 July 2018 |page=2 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

The building was built in 1880 for the [[Commercial Banking Company of Sydney]], with Mansfield Bros. as the architect and [[Sydney]] contractors White and Coghill as builders. It was described at its establishment by ''[[The Kiama Independent and Illawarra and Shoalhaven Advertiser]]'' as "likely to be one of the principal ornaments of Kiama".&lt;ref name=nswshr-143/&gt;&lt;ref name=local /&gt;

The CBC Bank shifted to new premises in Terralong Street {{circa}} 1969.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cbcbank.com.au/images/Branches/NSW/NSW%20Country/NSW%20Country%20G-L/nsw_country%20JK.htm | title=J-K NSW Country | publisher=CBC Officers Club | accessdate=20 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article126905890 |title=Advertising |newspaper=[[The Canberra Times]] |volume=56, |issue=17,075 |location=Australian Capital Territory, Australia |date=28 June 1982 |accessdate=20 July 2018 |page=10 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1979 Mr &amp; Mrs Roslyn McKinnon, owners of the CBC Bank, nominated it for a Permanent Conservation Order. At that time the front of the building was occupied by a solicitors practice, the rear was occupied by a veterinary surgeon and the upstairs was let as a flat. The owners of the property were seeking protection under the Heritage Act for the building with a view to attracting rating and taxation benefits.&lt;ref name=nswshr-143/&gt;

At its meeting of 14 January 1981 the Heritage Council recommended that a Permanent Conservation Order be placed over the former CBC Bank, Kiama.&lt;ref name=nswshr-143/&gt;

A Permanent Conservation Order was placed over the property on 17 July 1981.&lt;ref name=nswshr-143/&gt;

It was transferred to the State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.&lt;ref name=nswshr-143/&gt;

It now houses IT firm DropPoint.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.droppoint.com.au/droppoint-is-moving-2/ | title=DropPoint is Moving | publisher=DropPoint | accessdate=20 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==

In the [[human body]], the '''carpal tunnel''' or '''carpal canal''' is the passageway on the [[Anatomical terms of location#Arms|palmar]] side of the [[wrist]] that connects the [[forearm]] to the [[hand]].&lt;ref name="Schmidt-29"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tunnel is bounded by the [[Carpal bones|bones of the wrist]] and [[Flexor retinaculum of the hand|flexor retinaculum]] from connective tissue. Normally several [[tendon]]s from the [[Flexor muscle|flexor]] group of [[forearm muscles]] and the [[median nerve]] pass through it. There are described cases of variable [[median artery]] occurrence.

The canal is narrow, and when any of the nine long flexor tendons passing through it [[swelling (medical)|swell]] or degenerate, the narrowing of the canal may result in the median nerve becoming entrapped or compressed, a common medical condition known as [[carpal tunnel syndrome]].&lt;ref name="Thieme-Atlas-248"&gt;{{cite book

[[File:Wrist MRI T1FSE PDfrFSE STIR 14.jpg|thumb|Carpal tunnel as seen on MRI]]
The [[carpal bones]] that make up the wrist form an arch which is convex on the [[Anatomical terms of location#Dorsal and ventral|dorsal]] side of the hand and concave on the palmar side. The groove on the palmar side, the ''sulcus carpi'', is covered by the [[flexor retinaculum of the hand|flexor retinaculum]], a [[Tendon sheath|sheath]] of tough [[connective tissue]], thus forming the carpal tunnel. On the side of the [[radius (bone)|radius]], the flexor retinaculum is attached to the [[scaphoid bone]], more precisely its [[scaphoid bone#Bone|tubercle]], as well as the ridge of [[Trapezium (bone)|trapezium]]. On the [[ulna]]r side it is attached to the [[pisiform]] and [[hook of hamate]].&lt;ref name="Thieme-Atlas-354"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The narrowest section of the tunnel is located a centimetre beyond the mid-line of the [[Anatomical terms of location|distal]] [[Carpal bones#Bones|row of carpal bones]] where the sectional area is limited to 1.6&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name="Thieme-Atlas-248" /&gt;

The tendons of the flexor digitorum superficialis and profundus pass through a common ulnar sheath, while the tendon of the flexor pollicis longus passes through a separate radial sheath. The [[Vinculum (ligament)|mesotendon]] shared by these tendons is attached to the radial and palmar walls of the carpal tunnel.&lt;ref name="Thieme-Atlas-354" /&gt;

Superficial to the carpal tunnel and the flexor retinaculum, the [[ulnar artery]] and [[ulnar nerve]] pass through the [[ulnar tunnel|ulnar tunnel/Guyon's canal]].&lt;ref name="Thieme-Atlas-354" /&gt;

==Function==
[[File:Carpal-Tunnel.svg|thumb|Transverse section across the [[wrist]] and [[carpal]]s; the [[Hand#Human anatomy|palm]] is at the top (carpal tunnel not labeled but visible at centre)]]
Ten structures pass through the carpal tunnel, most of them flexor tendons&lt;ref name="Thieme-Atlas-248" /&gt; (not the muscles themselves):
* [[Flexor digitorum profundus muscle|flexor digitorum profundus]] (four tendons) 
* [[flexor digitorum superficialis]] (four tendons)
* [[Flexor pollicis longus muscle|flexor pollicis longus]] (one tendon)
* [[Median nerve]] between tendons of flexor digitorum profundus and flexor digitorum superficialis

The [[flexor carpi radialis]] (one tendon), is often incorrectly stated to travel within the carpal tunnel. More precisely, it travels within the fibers of the flexor retinaculum which forms the roof of the carpal tunnel, rather than running inside the tunnel itself.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; although it is more precise to state that it travels in the [[Flexor retinaculum of the hand|flexor retinaculum]], which covers the carpal tunnel, rather than running in the tunnel itself.--&gt;

=== Effect of wrist movements ===
Movements in the wrist affect the shape and width of the carpal tunnel. The width decreases considerably during normal range of motion in the wrist and because the carpal bones move in relation to each other with every motion of the hand the bony walls of the tunnel are not rigid. Both flexion and extension increase compression in the carpal tunnel.

* Flexing the wrist causes the flexor retinaculum to move closer to the radius which considerably decreases the cross section of the proximal opening of the tunnel. Additionally, the distal end of the capitate presses into the opening.
* In extreme extension, the lunate constricts the passage as it is pressed toward the interior of the tunnel.&lt;ref name="Schmidt-29" /&gt;&lt;!--- ref for entire sub-section ---&gt;

==Clinical significance==
{{main|Carpal tunnel syndrome}}
[[Carpal tunnel syndrome]] is a syndrome characterised by tingling burning and pain (needle, pin) through the course of median nerve particularly over the outer fingers and radiating up the arm, that is caused by compression of the carpal tunnel contents. It is associated with repetitive use, [[rheumatoid arthritis]], and a number of other states. It can be detected using [[Tinel's sign]] and the [[Phalen maneuver]]. It may be treated non-surgically by splinting and/or corticosteroid injection, though definitive management often requires surgical division of the flexor retinaculum, which forms the roof of the carpal tunnel. Carpal tunnel symptoms can sometimes be caused by tight muscles in the neck and shoulder region.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5678">A '''Clinical Data Repository''' (CDR) or '''Clinical Data Warehouse''' (CDW) is a [[real time database]] that consolidates data from a variety of clinical sources to present a unified view of a single [[patient]]. It is optimized to allow [[clinician]]s to retrieve data for a single patient rather than to identify a population of patients with common characteristics or to facilitate the management of a specific clinical department. Typical data types which are often found within a CDR include: clinical laboratory test results, patient [[demographics]], pharmacy information, [[radiology]] reports and images, [[pathology]] reports, hospital admission, discharge and transfer dates, [[ICD-9]] codes, discharge summaries, and progress notes.&lt;ref name=idrsurvey&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = MacKenzie | first1 = S. L. | last2 = Wyatt | first2 = M. C. | last3 = Schuff | first3 = R. | last4 = Tenenbaum | first4 = J. D. | last5 = Anderson | first5 = N. | title = Practices and perspectives on building integrated data repositories: Results from a 2010 CTSA survey | doi = 10.1136/amiajnl-2011-000508 | journal = Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association | volume = 19 | issue = e1 | pages = e119–e124 | year = 2012 | pmid =  22437072| pmc =3392848 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!--Potential Uses--&gt;

A Clinical Data Repository could be used in the hospital setting to track prescribing trends as well as for the monitoring of infectious diseases. One area CDR's could potentially be used is monitoring the prescribing of antibiotics in hospitals especially as the number of antiobiotic-resistant bacteria is ever increasing. In 1995, a study at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center conducted by the Harvard Medical School used a CDR to monitor vancomycin use and prescribing trends since vancomycin-resistant enterococci is a growing problem. They used the CDR to track the prescribing by linking the individual patient, medication, and the microbiology lab results which were all contained within the CDR. If the microbiology lab result did not support the use of vancomycin, it was suggested to change the medication to something appropriate as under the Center for Disease Control [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]] guidelines. The use of CDR's could help monitor infectious diseases in the hospital and the appropriate prescribing based on lab results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Samore M. Lichtenberg D |author2=Saubermann L |author3=Kawachi C |author4=Carmeli Y. | year = 1997| title = A Clinical Data Repository Enhances Hospital Infection Control | url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2233433/pdf/procamiaafs00001-0095.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Harvard Medical School | volume = 1997 | issue = | pages = 56–60 | pmc=2233433 | pmid=9357588}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of Clinical Data Repositories could provide a wealth of knowledge about patients, their medical conditions, and their outcome. The database could serve as a way to study the relationship and potential patterns between disease progression and management. The term "Medical Data Mining" has been coined for this method of research. Past epidemiological studies may not have had as complete of information as that which is contained in a CDR, which could lead to inconclusive data/results. The use of medical data mining and correlative studies using the CDR could serve as a valuable resource helping the future of healthcare in all facets of medicine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Prather JC, Lobach DF, Goodwin LK, Hales JW, Hage ML, Hammond WE | year = 1997| title = Medical Data Mining: Knowledge Discovery in a Clinical Data Warehouse | url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2233405/pdf/procamiaafs00001-0140.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Duke University Medical Center | volume = 1997 | issue = | pages = 101–105 | pmc=2233405 | pmid=9357597}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of data mining a CDW was used for screening variables that were associated with diabetes and poor glycemic control. It allowed for novel correlations that may have not been discovered without this method.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0933365702000519 | doi=10.1016/S0933-3657(02)00051-9 | pmid=12234716 | volume=26 | issue=1–2 | title=Data mining a diabetic data warehouse | journal=Artificial Intelligence in Medicine | pages=37–54| date=September 2002 | last1=Breault | first1=Joseph L. | last2=Goodall | first2=Colin R. | last3=Fos | first3=Peter J. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One potential use of a clinical data repository would be for clinical trials. This would allow for researchers to have all the information from a study in one place as well as let other researchers benefit from the data to further innovation. They would also be advantageous since they are digital and real-time. This would be easier to log data and keep it accurate since it would be digital rather than in paper form.

The clinical data repository is not without its weaknesses, however. Since they usually don't integrate with other non-clinical sources, following patient treatment across the care continuum becomes very difficult. In turn, tracking the true cost per case for each patient isn't feasible. IT teams spend most of their time gathering and compiling data instead of interpreting information and finding opportunities for cutting costs and improving patient care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.healthcatalyst.com/clinical-data-repository-data-warehouse|title=Clinical Data Repository vs. Data Warehouse: Which Do You Need?|work=healthcatalyst.com|date=2014-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dignity Health St. Joseph's Hospital and Medical Center''' is a [[hospital]] in [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]], [[Arizona]], [[United States|USA]], operated by [[Dignity Health]]. St. Joseph's is a 607-bed, not-for-profit hospital that provides a wide range of health, social and support services, with special advocacy for the poor and under served. It is home to the [[Barrow Neurological Institute]], the world's largest dedicated neurosurgical center and a renowned leader in neurosurgical training, research, and patient care.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.dignityhealth.org/arizona/locations/stjosephs|title=St. Joseph's Hospital and Medical Center|last=|first=|date=|website=Dignity Health|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Services ==
St. Joseph's is a center for tertiary care, medical education and research. It includes the [[Barrow Neurological Institute]], the Heart &amp; Lung Institute, and a Level I Trauma Center verified by the [[American College of Surgeons]]. The hospital is also a center for maternity care, orthopedics, oncology and many other medical services.

== History ==
The [[Sisters of Mercy]] came to Phoenix in 1892 to open a parish school. They were successful in that endeavor, but were also affected deeply by the suffering of [[tuberculosis]] victims. Realizing the most pressing need of the community, the Sisters expanded their original mission and began fund-raising to be able to establish a [[Sanatorium|sanitarium]].

Their efforts paid off. They collected enough money to rent a six-bedroom brick cottage at Fourth and Polk Streets in January 1895. They equipped each room with two beds for tuberculosis patients and created quarters for themselves in the living room. St. Joseph's Sanitarium was born.

Two months later, the Sisters had raised sufficient funds to build a "real hospital." On March 19, 1895, a stake was driven into the ground to mark the site of what would become a hospital housing 24 private rooms that opened onto porches.

Through the years, there were additions to that building, of course, and a devastating fire in 1917, after which the building was reconstructed in just 90 days. The rebuilt facility was adequate for the community for the next 30 years, but the local population was continuing to grow significantly. In 1930, the population of Phoenix was 48,118. By 1945, it had reached nearly 100,000. St. Joseph's Hospital needed a larger facility.

In the mid-1940s, the Sisters purchased {{convert|10|acre}} of land at Third Avenue and Thomas Road which was then part of an old dairy farm. They were criticized for choosing land so far north of the city, literally out in the country. But the Sisters had foresight and a keen understanding of a good business deal. Those 10 acres cost just $25,000.

In November 1947, a fundraising campaign began to raise money to build the new hospital. The facility opened in July 1953.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.stjosephs-phx.org/Who_We_Are/History/index.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, Bishop [[Thomas Olmsted]] revoked the hospital's affiliation with the [[Roman Catholic Church]] in a controversy over medical procedures and church teachings (see below).

== Facilities ==
St. Joseph's Hospital also has a Lung Transplant Program, which offers transplants to those individuals diagnosed with high-risk [[lung diseases]]. The program is offered through the Center of Thoracic Transplantation and has received accreditation from the [[Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services]] (CMS). On April 13, 2007, the hospital performed the first recorded [[lung transplant]] in [[Phoenix, Arizona]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stjosephs-phx.org/stellent/groups/public/@xinternet_con_sjh/documents/webcontent/188175.pdf "13" Proving a Lucky Number for St. Joseph's Lung Transplantation Program"], Accessed October 13, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, more than 170 such transplants have been conducted by the program.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stjosephs-phx.org/stellent/groups/public/@xinternet_con_sjh/documents/webcontent/201042.pdf "St. Joseph's Expects Lung Transplant Program to Nearly Double after Receiving CMS Accreditation"], October 23, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stjosephs-phx.org/Medical_Services/Center_for_Thoracic_Transplantation/index.htm "Center for Thoracic Transplantation"], Accessed September 24, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Barrow Neurological Institute ===
St. Joseph's Hospital and Medical Center is home to the [[Barrow neurological institute]] (BNI), a nationally ranked program in neurology and neurosurgery.&lt;ref name="U.S. News &amp; World Report"&gt;{{cite news | title=Best Hospitals 2009 Specialty Search: Neurology and neurosurgery | publisher=[[U.S. News &amp; World Report]] | url =http://health.usnews.com/health/best-hospitals/neurology-and-neurosurgery-hospital-rankings/ | work = | accessdate = 2009-08-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The BNI has the largest neurosurgery residency program in the United States, as of 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lochhead|first=R|journal=World Neurosurg|year=2010|volume=74|pages=71–80|pmid=21299987|doi=10.1016/j.wneu.2010.07.011|issue=1|title=A history of the Barrow Neurological Institute|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; The current director of the BNI is vascular neurosurgeon [[Robert F. Spetzler]], a position he has held since 1986.

== Centers for Clinical Research ==
Dignity Health currently supports 16 internal Institutional Review Boards providing oversight for more than  1,000 clinical trials across the system. Dignity's Human Research Protection Office provides for the regulatory and compliance oversight of all research conducted at Dignity.

== Controversies ==
{{Main|Excommunication of Margaret McBride}}
The hospital in late 2009 had as a patient a mother of four who was 11 weeks pregnant and suffering from a severe case of [[pulmonary hypertension]]. Doctors estimated that her chance of dying if she continued the pregnancy was "close to 100 percent".&lt;ref name=McBride&gt;{{cite news|date=2010-05-19|work=National Public Radio|title=Nun Excommunicated for Allowing Abortion|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=126985072|last=Hagerty|first=Barbara}}&lt;/ref&gt; An ethics board approved an abortion to save the life of the mother, even though the hospital was Catholic and within the Diocese of Phoenix. A religious sister, Sister Margaret Mary McBride, who was a vice president at the hospital and who concurred in the decision, was [[excommunicated]] by [[Thomas Olmsted]], the Bishop of Phoenix.&lt;ref&gt;Goodstein, Laurie. "Arizona: Hospital Loses Catholic Affiliation." ''The New York Times,''  December 22, 2010, pg. A25&lt;/ref&gt;  The case stirred intense debate from within and outside the area. McBride was later returned to good standing with the church, her religious community, and the hospital.&lt;ref&gt;NEWS BRIEFS Dec-9-2011. [http://www.catholicnews.com/data/briefs/cns/20111209.htm#head13 Mercy nun at hospital that allowed abortion 'no longer excommunicated'] Catholic News Service.  Retrieved 2012-03-23.  "Sister Margaret 'met the requirements for reinstatement with the church and she is no longer excommunicated. She continues to be a member in good standing with the Sisters of Mercy and is a valued member of the St. Joseph's executive team.'"&lt;/ref&gt;

Bishop Olmsted asked Catholic Healthcare West to provide a moral analysis of the case.  He later issued a decree on 21 December 2010 revoking the hospital's affiliation with the Catholic Church, after months of discussion had failed to induce the hospital management to refuse to perform similar abortions in the future. Olmsted wrote that he could not verify that the hospital provides health care consistent with "authentic Catholic moral teaching."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4030">{{Culture of Dominica}}

'''Dominica cuisine''' is the cuisine of the island nation of [[Dominica]].    The cuisine is rooted in [[Louisiana Creole cuisine|creole]] techniques with local produce flavored by spices found on the island.&lt;ref&gt;Sullivan, Lynne M. Adventure Guide to Dominica and St Lucia. Hunter Publishing, Inc, 2004. {{ISBN|1-58843-393-5}}. P.107&lt;/ref&gt;

==Foods==
Dominica's cuisine is similar to many other [[Caribbean]] islands including that of Trinidad and St Lucia. Though separated by water Dominica and other Commonwealth Caribbean islands have distinct twists to their meals. 

Breakfast is an important meal in Dominica and is eaten every day. A typical meal includes saltfish, which is dried and salted codfish, and bakes made by making a dough and frying in oil prove popular before a long days at work. Saltfish and bakes can also double as fast food snacks that can be eaten throughout the day; vendors and Dominica's streets sell these snacks to passers-by alongside fried chicken, fish and tasty smoothies. Other breakfast meals include cornmeal porridge which is made with fine cornmeal or polenta, milk and condensed milk and sugar to sweeten. More British influenced meals like eggs, bacon and toast are also popular alongside fried fish and plantains. 

Common vegetables eaten during lunchtime or dinner include plantains, tania, yams, potatoes, rice, and peas. Meat and poultry typically eaten include chicken (which is very popular), beef, fish which are normally stewed down with onions, carrots, garlic, ginger and herbs like thyme and using the browning method to create a rich dark sauce. Popular meals include rice and peas, Stew chicken, Stew beef, fried and stewed fish and many different types of hearty fish broths and Soups which are packed full with dumplings, carrots and ground provisions.

Roadside stands and small-town restaurants typically serve fried chicken, fish-and-chips and "tasty bakes" which are fried dough made with flour, water and sugar or sometimes salt, along with cold drinks. The island produces numerous exotic fruits, including [[banana]]s, [[coconut]]s, [[papaya]]s, [[guava]]s, [[pineapple]]s, and [[mango]]es which can be eaten as dessert and be pureed or liquefied.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dominica.dm/site/dining.cfm |title=Dominica's Dining |publisher=Discover Dominica Authority |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090223034004/http://www.dominica.dm/site/dining.cfm |archivedate=2009-02-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dominica's national dish is the [[mountain chicken]], which are snares of the legs of a frog called the Crapaud, which is [[endemism|endemic]] to Dominica and [[Montserrat]].  Found at higher elevations, it's a [[endangered species|protected species]] and can only be caught between autumn and February.

==Beverages==
[[River]]s flowing down from the mountains provide Dominica with an abundant supply of freshwater. Drinks include rum punch and freshly made smoothies. 

[[Dominica tea culture]] has a long history. Many traditional medicinal teas have origins with the original [[Island Caribs|Carib culture]] of the island. Dominica brews its own beer under the Kubuli label.

Founded in 1967, the '''European Congress of Radiology''' was first held every four years in different locations. However, the idea of developing a new type of congress became more intensively discussed as the quadrennial basis and the ever-changing location did not allow for the creation of a consistent group of experienced [[radiologist]]s responsible for the preparation of the congress. Furthermore, the radiological community in [[Europe]] wanted to create a common platform for European radiologists.

In 1985, a committee chaired by Prof. Dr. Josef Lissner from Munich (Germany) was established to re-organise the Congress. They decided that it should take place every two years and that the location should not change. Vienna was soon selected, due to its geographical location in the heart of Europe. The society ‘Verein Europäischer Röntgenkongress’ (ECR) was founded, and a congress-organising institution was established at the Medical Academy of Vienna.

The first ‘new’ European Congress of Radiology was opened on Saturday, September 15, 1991 under the presidency of Prof. Dr. Lissner. It attracted more than 9,000 participants from around the world.

The two-year cycle of the congress was continued until 1999, when it was decided that the rapid development of the medical specialty of radiology required an annual meeting of Europe’s radiological community and all its partners.

The ESR has continued to develop and refine its congress ever since, turning it into the largest radiological meeting in Europe with more than 28,000 participants from around 100 countries and 4,000 scientific papers and exhibits. To answer growing demand, the ECR has developed advanced tools such as EPOS, an online electronic presentation system and ECR Online, providing coverage of the majority of sessions via live video streaming.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8507">'''Fellow of the Royal Australasian College of Physicians''', abbreviated as the [[post-nominal]] initials '''FRACP''', is a recognition of the completion of the prescribed postgraduate specialist training programme in internal adult or internal paediatric medicine of the [[Royal Australasian College of Physicians]].

==Fellowship training programme==
The fellowship training programme requires that prospective trainees are registered [[medical doctor|medical practitioners]] in [[Australia]] and/or [[New Zealand]].&lt;ref name="Training"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.racp.edu.au/page/educational-and-professional-development/training-pathways |title=RACP: Training Pathways |publisher=Royal Australasian College of Physician |accessdate=17 August 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130807110244/http://www.racp.edu.au/page/educational-and-professional-development/training-pathways |archivedate=7 August 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, prospective trainees must have completed a medical degree; completed an intern year; been appointed to an accredited hospital by the College for basic training; discussed their application with, and received approval from, the accredited hospital or a Director of Physician Education.&lt;ref name="Basic"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.racp.edu.au/page/educational-and-professional-development/prep-basic-training |title=RACP: PREP Basic Training |publisher=Royal Australasian College of Physicians |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130807171953/http://www.racp.edu.au/page/educational-and-professional-development/prep-basic-training |archivedate=2013-08-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; International medical graduates must complete the [[Australian Medical Council]] Certificate in addition to the aforementioned requirements.&lt;ref name="Basic"/&gt;

Multiple pathways lead to fellowship, but all pathways require significant amount of training, time and commitment and consist of three main stages:&lt;ref name="Training"/&gt;
*Basic training;
*RACP examinations; and,
*Advanced training.

The qualification of FRACP is awarded for training programmes in adult internal medicine and in paediatrics and child health. Both programmes have a similar structure, but the content and examinations are accordingly different.&lt;ref name="Training"/&gt;

===Basic training===
Basic training, formally the Royal Australasian College of Physicians's Physician Readiness for Expert Practice (PREP), consists of a series of 36 months of accredited hospital posts, approved by local directors of physician training. These posts encompass a variety of [[medical specialty|medical specialties]]; emergency medicine; and tertiary centre, regional, and rural hospital rotations.&lt;ref name="Basic"/&gt;

The programme must contain prescribed proportions of the aforementioned areas and locations and is assessed by ongoing continuous assessment by the candidate's supervising physicians.&lt;ref name="Basic"/&gt;

Basic training is approximately equivalent to the internal medicine [[Residency (medicine)|residency program]] in the [[United States]] or core medical training programme in the [[United Kingdom]].

===RACP examinations===
After 24 months of basic training, trainees become eligible to sit the external RACP examinations. These consist of a written and a clinical examination. The written examination consists of multiple-choice questions and is held once a year in March. The clinical examination, consisting of two long cases and four short cases, is examined by two assessors (per case) and is held in July, after successful completion of the written exam. Both examinations must be successfully completed before a trainee may progress to advanced training.

The written examination is analogous to the [[American Board of Internal Medicine|board certification examination for internal medicine]] in the United States and the [[Membership of the Royal College of Physicians|MRCP]] Part 1 and 2 (written) exams in the United Kingdom. Unlike the United States and United Kingdom examinations, however, the RACP examinations do not confer an award or qualification upon their successful completion; instead, the entire RACP programme must be successfully completed for the award and qualification of FRACP.

The RACP examinations are the primary hurdle to becoming a specialist physician and are noted for being among the most difficult specialty exams in the world,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imsanz.org.au/training/how-to-pass-the-insiders-guide-to-the-racp-examinations|title=''How to Pass: The Insider's Guide to the RACP Examinations''|publisher=Internal Medicine Society of Australia and New Zealand}}&lt;/ref&gt; with an average first-attempt fail rate of approximately 50%.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

===Advanced training===
Advanced training consists of a programme of 3–4 years, depending on the requirements of the specialty, of training in a specialty of the trainee's choosing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.racp.edu.au/page/educational-and-professional-development/advanced-training |title=RACP: Advanced Training |publisher=Royal Australasian College of Physicians |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130807123625/http://www.racp.edu.au/page/educational-and-professional-development/advanced-training |archivedate=2013-08-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A trainee must meet the requirements of the specialty advisory group via undertaking, for instance, clinical training in hospital posts, research, or clinical training in overseas hospital posts or research overseas. Multiple specialisations and subspecialisations are possible,{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} but this is associated with increases in training time.

Unlike the United States, Canada, Europe, and the United Kingdom,{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} most specialties do not require an exit examination.{{which|date=August 2013}}{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

==Recognition==
{{Cleanup-rewrite|date=August 2013|2=section}}
{{unreferenced|section|date=July 2016}}
Fellowship appears to be a highly regarded qualification, given the extended and rigorous training program,the wide experience &amp; knowledge base, and general commitment required for its attainment. 

Fellowship of the [[Royal Australasian College of Physicians]](or its recognised equivalent) is a requirement to be recognised as a Specialist or Consultant Physician, in General (Internal) Medicine or the relevant subspecialty, in Australia and New Zealand. A formal complex process (for recognition of equivalence) is needed for specialists who possess overseas specialist qualifications but who do not possess the FRACP. The requirements change from time to time. External commentators, such as Mr [[Peter Garling]], [[Senior Counsel|SC]], have described these processes as 'onerous' during a 2008 statutory inquiry.

FRACP or its recognised equivalent, in Australia, also allows some Physicians to be recognised as specialists within the Health Insurance Act 1973, and therefore charges incurred by patients when consulting them, may be reimbursed in whole or part by the [[Australian Government]]. In Australia, like in the UK and some other jurisdictions, the FRACP (and other fellowships) does not give the right to statutory registration as a medical practitioner: it is the basic medical degree which does.

Accountability for the quality of the examination processes within the RACP is of the highest standard and widely envied by other similar International bodies.  The clinical examination process requires rigorous calibration of all examiners (mandatory) and assessment of all candidates against the clinical skills required of Consultation Physicians in Australia  - history taking, clinical analytical abilities and clinical Skills.  Evaluation of the clinical examiners includes assessment by other (often more experienced) examiners and high level peer review (by at least 1 other examiner at a local level, and by 6-9 at the national level, always in combination).  The National Examinations Panel (NEP) consist of 97 adult physicians selected by their prior examination performance and who represent the geographical spread and specialist range of clinical internal medicine skills in Australia and New Zealand.

'''Froth flotation''' is a process for selectively separating [[hydrophobic]] materials from [[hydrophilic]]. This is used in mineral processing, [[paper recycling]] and waste-water treatment industries. Historically this was first used in the mining industry, where it was one of the great enabling technologies of the 20th century. It has been described as "the single most important operation used for the recovery and upgrading of [[Sulfide#Geology|sulfide ores]]".&lt;ref&gt;G J Jameson, "Flotation cell development," in: ''The AusIMM Annual Conference, Broken Hill, New South Wales, 17–21 May 1992'' (The Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy: Melbourne, 1992), 25–31.&lt;/ref&gt; The development of [[froth]] flotation has improved the recovery of valuable [[minerals]], such as [[copper]]- and [[lead]]-bearing minerals. Along with mechanized mining, it has allowed the economic recovery of valuable metals from much lower grade ore than previously.

==History==

=== 19th century ===
Descriptions of the use of a flotation process have been found in ancient Greek and Persian literature suggesting its antiquity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nelson|first1=Michael|title=”From 10 Cubic Feet to 500 Cubic Meters--Observations on 100 Years of Flotation Technology"|journal=Separation Technologies book edited by Courtney Young et al|date=2012|pages=539-546|publisher=Society of Mining, Metallurgy and Exploration}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the late nineteenth century, the process basics were discovered through a slow evolutionary phase; then, during the first decade of the twentieth century, a more rapid investigation of oils, froths, and agitation led to proven work-place applications, especially at Broken Hill, Australia, that brought the technological innovation known as “froth flotation.”  During the early twentieth century, it truly and dramatically revolutionized -- an overworked term, but accurate here -- mineral processing around the globe.

Initially, naturally occurring chemicals such as [[fatty acid]]s and oils were used as flotation [[reagent]]s in a large quantity to increase the hydrophobicity of the valuable minerals. Since then, the process has been adapted and applied to a wide variety of materials to be separated, and additional collector agents, including [[surfactants]] and synthetic compounds have been adopted for various applications.

Englishman William Haynes patented a process in 1860 for separating [[sulfide]] and [[gangue]] minerals using oil.  Later writers have pointed to Haynes's as the first "bulk oil flotation" patent, though there is no evidence of its ever being field tested, let alone used commercially.  While in 1877 the brothers Bessel (Adolph and August) of Dresden, Germany, introduced their commercially successful oil and froth flotation process for extracting [[graphite]], considered by some the root of froth flotation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nguyen|first1=Ahn|title=Colloidal Science of Flotation|date=2003|isbn=0824747828|pages=11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, because the Bessel process was used on graphite not gold, silver, copper, lead, zinc, etc, their work has been ignored by most historians of the technology. Seventy-seven year old inventor Hezekiah Bradford of Philadelphia imitated their work and patented a similar process in 1885.  He had received his first patent in 1834, primarily invented machinery to separate slate from coal during the 1850s-1860s, and perfected the Bradford Breaker, still in use by the coal industry today, but it is uncertain if his 1885 patented "flotation" process was successfully introduced in the graphite deposits in nearby Chester County, Pennsylvania.

In 1885 [[Carrie Everson]] patented a process calling for oil[s] but also an acid or a salt, a significant step in the evolution of the process history.  By 1890, tests of the Everson process had been made at Georgetown and Silver Cliff, Colorado, and Baker, Oregon.  She abandoned the work with the death of her husband, and before perfecting a commercial successful process.  Later, during the height of legal disputes over the validity or not of various patents during the 1910s, Everson's was often pointed to as the initial flotation patent -- which would have meant that the process was not patentable again by later contestants.  Much confusion has been clarified recently by historian Dawn Bunyak.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bunyak|first1=Dawn|title=The Inventor, the Patent, and Carrie Everson: Defining Success|journal=Mining History Journal|date=2005|pages=9-24|url=https://www.mininghistoryassociation.org/Journal/MHJ-v12-2005-Bunyak.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== First commercial flotation process ===
The generally recognized first successful commercial flotation process for ''mineral'' [[Sulfide|sulphides]] was invented by Frank Elmore&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maelgwyn.com/birthplaceflotation.html#top|accessdate=2010-01-13|title=Wales - The birthplace of Flotation}}&lt;/ref&gt; who worked on the development with his brother, Stanley. The Glasdir copper mine at [[Llanelltyd]], near [[Dolgellau]] in [[North Wales]] was bought in 1896 by the Elmore brothers in conjunction with their father, William. In 1897, the Elmore brothers installed the world's first industrial size commercial flotation process for mineral beneficiation at the Glasdir mine. The process was not froth flotation but used oil to agglomerate (make balls of) pulverised sulphides and [[Buoyancy|buoy]] them to the surface, and was patented in 1898 with a description of the process published in 1903 in the ''Engineering and Mining Journal''. By this time they had recognized the importance of air bubbles in assisting the oil to carry away the mineral particles. The Elmores had formed a company known as the Ore Concentration Syndicate Ltd to promote the commercial use of the process worldwide. Charles Butters of Berkeley, California, acquired American rights to Elmores' process, and developed what was known to contemporaries as the "Butters Process".  Butters, an expert on the [[Gold cyanidation|cyanide process]], tried lab test of the Elmore process on gold ores without success. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rickard|first=Thomas A.|title=Interviews with Mining Engineers|year=1922|publisher=Mining and Scientific Press|location=San Francisco|pages=119–131}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

However developments elsewhere, particularly in [[Broken Hill, Australia]] by [[Minerals Separation, Limited]], led to decades of hard fought legal battles and litigations which, ultimately, were lost as the Elmore process was superseded by more advanced techniques. Another flotation process was independently invented in the early 1900s in Australia by Charles Vincent Potter and around the same time by [[Guillaume Daniel Delprat]].&lt;ref name=adb&gt;{{Australian Dictionary of Biography |last=Osborne |first=Graeme |id2=delprat-guillaume-daniel-5947 |title=Guillaume Daniel Delprat |year=1981 |accessdate= 7 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.austehc.unimelb.edu.au/guides/mine/historicalnote.htm|title=Historical Note|accessdate=2007-12-30|publisher=Minerals Separation Ltd }}&lt;/ref&gt; This process (developed circa 1902) did not use oil, but relied upon flotation by the generation of gas formed by the introduction of acid into the pulp. In 1902, Froment combined oil and gaseous flotation using a modification of the Potter-Delprat process.  During the first decade of the twentieth century, Broken Hill became the center of innovation leading to the perfection of the froth flotation process by many technologists there borrowing from each other and building on these first successes.

Yet another process was developed in 1902 by Cattermole, who emulsified the pulp with a small quantity of oil, subjected it to violent agitation, then slow stirring which coagulated the target minerals into nodules which were separated from the pulp by gravity. The Minerals Separation Ltd., formed in Britain in 1903 to acquire the Cattermole patent, found that it proved unsuccessful.  Metallurgists on the staff continued to test and combine other discoveries to patent in 1905 their process, called the Sulman-Picard-Ballot process after company officers and patentees. The process proved successful at their Central Block plant, Broken Hill that year.  Significant in their "agitation froth flotation" process was the use of less than 1% oil and an agitation step that created small bubbles, which provided more surface to capture the metal and float into to a froth at the surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Malozemoff|first1=Plato|title=“Operating Characteristics of Mechanical Flotation Machines,”|journal=Engineering &amp; Mining Journal|date=March 1941|page=45-49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mineral Separation also bought other patents to consolidate ownership of any potential conflicting rights to the flotation process--except for the Elmore patents.  In 1910, when the Zinc Corporation replaced its Elmore process with the Minerals Separation (Sulman-Picard-Ballot) froth flotation process at its Broken Hill plant, the primacy of the Minerals Separation over other process contenders was assured.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mouat|first1=Jeremy|title=The Development of the Flotation Process: Technological Change and the Genesis of Modern Mining, 1898-1911|journal=Australian Economic Review|date=March 1996|volume=36|issue=1|pages=3-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Henry Livingston Sulman was later recognized by his peers in his election as President of the British Institution of Mining and Metallurgy, which also awarded him its gold medal. 

=== 1900s ===
Developments in the United States had been less than spectacular.  Butters's failures, as well as others, was followed after 1904, with Scotsman Stanley MacQuisten's process (a surface tension based method), which was developed with a [[modicum]] of success in Nevada and Idaho, but this would not work when [[Tailings|slimes]] were present, a major fault.  Henry E. Wood of Denver had developed his flotation process along the same lines in 1907, patented 1911, with some success on molybdenum ores.  For the most part, however, these were isolated attempts without fanfare for what can only be called marginal successes.  

In 1911, [[James M. Hyde]], a former employee of Minerals Separation, Ltd., modified the Minerals Separation process and installed a test plant in the Butte and Superior Mill in [[Basin, Montana]], the first such installation in the USA.  In 1912, he designed the Butte &amp; Superior zinc works, Butte, Montana, the first great flotation plant in America.&lt;ref&gt;Callow; 1916&lt;/ref&gt;  Minerals Separation, Ltd., which had set up an office in San Francisco, sued Hyde for infringement as well as the Butte &amp; Superior company, both cases were eventually won by the firm in the U. S. Supreme Court.  [[Daniel Cowan Jackling]] and partners, who controlled Butte &amp; Superior, also refuted the Minerals Separation patent and funded the ensuing legal battles that lasted over a decade.  They -- Utah Copper (Kennecott), Nevada Consolidated, Chino Copper, Ray Con and other Jackling firms -- eventually settled, in 1922, paying a substantial fee for licenses to use the Minerals Separation process.  One unfortunate result of the dispute was professional divisiveness among the mining engineering community for a generation.

In 1913, the Minerals Separation paid for a test plant for the Inspiration Copper Company at Miami, Arizona.  Built under the San Francisco office director, Edward Nutter, it proved a success.  Inspiration engineer [[L. D. Ricketts]] ripped out a gravity concentration mill and replaced it with the Minerals Separation process, the first major use of the process at an American copper mine.  A major holder of Inspiration stock were men who controlled the great Anaconda mine of Butte.  They immediately followed the Inspiration success to build a Minerals Separation licensed plant at Butte, in 1915-1916, a major statement about the final acceptance of the Minerals Separation patented process.  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Parsons|first1=A. B.|title=The Porphyry Coppers|date=1933|publisher=American Institute of Mining and Metallurgical Engineers|location=New York|pages=239-246, 446-450}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

John M. Callow, of General Engineering of [[Salt Lake City, Utah|Salt Lake City]], had followed flotation from technical papers and the introduction in both the Butte and Superior Mill, and at Inspiration Copper in Arizona and determined that mechanical agitation was a drawback to the existing technology. Introducing a porous brick with compressed air, and a mechanical stirring mechanism, Callow applied for a patent in 1914 (some say that Callow, a Jackling partisan, invented his cell as a means to avoid paying royalties to Minerals Separation, which firms using his cell eventually were forced to do by the courts).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rickard|first=Thomas A.|title=Interviews with Mining Engineers|year=1922|publisher=Mining and Scientific Press|location=San Francisco|pages=142}}&lt;/ref&gt; This method, known as Pneumatic Flotation, was recognized as an alternative to the Minerals Separation process of flotation concentration.&lt;ref&gt;A detailed description of the history of flotation and this process can be found in Callows "Notes on Flotation" found in the ''Transactions of the American Institute of Mining Engineers''; Vol 53-54, originally presented in New York in February 1916.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[American Institute of Mining Engineers]] presented Callow the James Douglas Gold Medal in 1926 for his contributions to the field of flotation.  By that time, flotation technology was changing, especially with the discovery of the use of xanthates and other reagents, which made the Callow cell and his process obsolete.

Montana Tech professor [[Antoine Marc Gaudin]] defined the early period of flotation as the mechanical phase while by the late 1910s it entered the chemical phase.  Discoveries in reagents, especially the use of xanthates patented by Minerals Separations chemist Cornelius H. Keller, not so much increased the capture of minerals through the process as making it far more manageable in day to day operations.  Minerals Separation's initial flotation patents ended 1923, and new ones for chemical processes gave it a significant position into the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gaudin,|first1=A. M.|title=Flotation|date=1932|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=New York|pages=passim}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During this period the company also developed and patented flotation processes for iron out of its Hibbing lab and of phosphate in its Florida lab.  Another rapid phase of flotation process innovation did not occur until after 1960.

In the 1960s the froth flotation technique was adapted for [[deinking]] [[recycled paper]].

The success of the process is evinced by the number of claimants as "discoverers" of flotation.  In 1961, American engineers celebrated "50 years of flotation" and enshrined James Hyde and his Butte &amp; Superior mill.  In 1977, German engineers celebrated the "hundredth anniversary of flotation" based on the brothers Bessel patent of 1877.  The historic Glasdir copper mine site advertises its tours in Wales as site of the "discovery of flotation" based upon the Elmore brothers work.  Recent writers, because of the interest in celebrating women in science, champion Carrie Everson of Denver as mother of the process based on her 1885 patent.  Omitted from this list are the engineers, metallurgists and chemists of Minerals Separation, Ltd., which, at least in the American and Australian courts, won control of froth flotation patents as well as right of claimant as discoverers of froth flotation.  But, as historian Martin Lynch writes, "Mineral Separation would eventually prevail after taking the case to the US Supreme Court [and the House of Lords], and in so doing earned for itself the cordial detestation of many in the mining world."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Lynch |first1=Martin |title=Mining in World History |date=2002 |publisher=Reaktion Press |location=London |isbn=978-1-86189-173-0 |page=208}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Froth flotation is a process for separating minerals from gangue by taking advantage of differences in their [[hydrophobicity]]. Hydrophobicity differences between valuable minerals and waste gangue are increased through the use of surfactants and wetting agents. The selective separation of the minerals makes processing complex (that is, mixed) ores economically feasible. The flotation process is used for the separation of a large range of [[sulfide]]s, [[carbonate]]s and [[oxide]]s prior to further refinement. [[Phosphates]] and [[coal]] are also upgraded (purified) by flotation technology.

Prior to 1907, nearly all the copper mined in the US came from underground vein deposits, averaging 2.5 percent copper.&lt;ref name = "Wills"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wills | first1 = B A | last2 = Atkinson | first2 = K | year = 1991 | title = The development of minerals engineering in the 20th Century | url = | journal = Minerals Engineering | volume = 4 | issue = | pages = 643–652 | doi=10.1016/0892-6875(91)90054-y}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1991, the average grade of copper ore mined in the US had fallen to only 0.6 percent.&lt;ref name = "Wills"/&gt;

===Waste water treatment===
The [[Continuous foam separation|flotation process]] is also widely used in industrial waste water treatment plants, where it removes fats, oil, grease and suspended solids from waste water. These units are called [[dissolved air flotation]] (DAF) units.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Beychok, Milton R. | title=[[Aqueous Wastes from Petroleum and Petrochemical Plants]]| edition=1st | publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd. | year=1967 | id=[[Library of Congress Control Number|LCCN 67019834]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, dissolved air flotation units are used in removing oil from the wastewater [[effluent]]s of [[Oil refinery|oil refineries]], [[petrochemical]] and [[chemical plant]]s, [[Natural gas processing|natural gas processing plants]] and similar industrial facilities.

===Paper recycling===
{{Main article|Deinking}}
Froth flotation is one of the processes used to recover [[recycled paper]]. In the [[paper industry]] this step is called deinking or just flotation. The target is to release and remove the hydrophobic contaminants from the recycled paper. The contaminants are mostly [[printing ink]] and [[Stickies (papermaking)|stickies]]. Normally the setup is a two-stage system with 3,4 or 5 flotation cells in series.&lt;ref&gt;Voith EcoCell flotation plant {{cite web |url=http://www.voithpaper.com/applications/productsearch/files/594_VPR-PB-07-0001-GB-07.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-01-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090824075218/http://www.voithpaper.com/applications/productsearch/files/594_VPR-PB-07-0001-GB-07.pdf |archivedate=2009-08-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Principle of operation==
Before froth flotation can work, the ore to be treated is reduced to fine particles by crushing and grinding (a process known as [[comminution]]) so that the various minerals exist as physically separate grains. This process is known as ''liberation''. The particle sizes are typically less than 0.1&amp;nbsp;mm (100&amp;nbsp;µm), but sometimes sizes smaller than 7–10&amp;nbsp;µm are required.&lt;ref&gt;D N Nihill, C M Stewart and P Bowen, "The McArthur River mine—the first years of operation," in: ''AusIMM ’98 – The Mining Cycle, Mount Isa, 19–23 April 1998'' (The Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy: Melbourne, 1998), 73–82.&lt;/ref&gt; There is a tendency for the liberation size of the minerals to decrease over time as the ore bodies with coarse mineral grains that can be separated at larger sizes are depleted and replaced by ore bodies that were formerly considered too difficult.

In the mining industry, the plants where flotation is undertaken to concentrate [[ore]] are generally known as ''concentrators'' or ''mills''.

For froth flotation, the ground ore is mixed with water to form a [[slurry]] and the desired mineral is rendered hydrophobic by the addition of a surfactant or ''collector'' chemical (although some mineral surfaces are naturally hydrophobic,&lt;ref&gt;E V Manlapig, C Green, J W Parkinson and A S Murphy, "The technology and economic incentives for recovering coal from tailings impoundments," ''SME Annual Meeting, Denver, Colorado, 26–28 February 2001, Preprint 01-70'' (Society of Mining, Metallurgy and Exploration: Littleton, Colorado, 2001).&lt;/ref&gt; requiring little or no addition of collector). The particular chemical depends on the nature of the mineral to be recovered and, perhaps, the natures of those that are not wanted. As an example, [[sodium ethyl xanthate]] may be added as a collector in the selective flotation of [[galena]] (lead sulfide) to separate it from [[sphalerite]] (zinc sulfide). This slurry (more properly called the ''pulp'') of hydrophobic particles and hydrophilic particles is then introduced to tanks known as ''flotation cells'' that are aerated to produce bubbles. The hydrophobic particles attach to the air bubbles, which rise to the surface, forming a froth.&lt;ref name="linmahanglead" /&gt; The froth is removed from the cell, producing a concentrate ("con") of the target mineral.

Frothing agents, known as ''frothers'', may be introduced to the pulp to promote the formation of a stable froth on top of the flotation cell.

The minerals that do not float into the froth are referred to as the ''flotation tailings'' or ''flotation tails''. These tailings may also be subjected to further stages of flotation to recover the valuable particles that did not float the first time. This is known as ''scavenging''. The final tailings after scavenging are normally pumped for disposal as mine fill or to tailings disposal facilities for long-term storage.

Froth flotation efficiency is determined by a series of probabilities: those of particle–bubble contact, particle–bubble attachment, transport between the pulp and the froth, and froth collection into the product launder.&lt;ref name = "Atkinson 1993"&gt;B W Atkinson, C J Conway and G J Jameson, [http://www.jamesoncell.com/EN/Downloads/technical%20papers/Fundamentals%20of%20Jameson%20Cell%20Operation%20including%20Size-Yield%20Respone%20-%20Atkinson%20Conway%20Jameson.pdf "Fundamentals of Jameson Cell operation including size–yield response,"] in: ''Sixth Australian Coal Preparation Conference, Mackay, Queensland, 6–9 September 1993'' (The Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy: Melbourne, 1993).&lt;/ref&gt; In a conventional mechanically-agitated cell, the void fraction (i.e. volume occupied by air bubbles) is low (5 to 10 percent) and the bubble size is usually greater than 1&amp;nbsp;mm.&lt;ref name = "Atkinson 1995"/&gt; This results in a relatively low interfacial area and a low probability of particle–bubble contact.&lt;ref name = "Atkinson 1995"&gt;B W Atkinson, C J Conway and G J Jameson, "High-efficiency flotation of coarse and fine coal," in: ''High-efficiency Coal Preparation: An International Symposium,'' (Society of Mining, Metallurgy and Exploration: Littleton, Colorado, 1995).&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, several cells in series are required to increase the particle residence time, thus increasing the probability of particle–bubble contact.&lt;ref name = "Atkinson 1995"/&gt;

Flotation is normally undertaken in several stages to maximize the recovery of the target mineral or minerals and the concentration of those minerals in the concentrate, while minimizing the energy input.&lt;ref name = "Pease"&gt;J Pease, "[http://www.isamill.com/EN/Downloads/Downloaded%20Technical%20Papers/Joe_Pease.pdf Increasing the energy efficiency of grinding]," Presented at: ''Crushing and Grinding, Brisbane, September 2007.'' Accessed 24 May 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Flotation stages===

====Roughing====
The first stage is called ''roughing'', which produces a ''rougher concentrate''. The objective is to remove the maximum amount of the valuable mineral at as coarse a particle size as practical.&lt;ref name = "Pease"/&gt; The finer an ore is ground, the greater the energy that is required, so it makes sense to fine grind only those particles that need fine grinding.&lt;ref name = "Pease"/&gt; Complete liberation is not required for rougher flotation, only sufficient liberation to release enough gangue from the valuable mineral to get a high recovery.&lt;ref name = "Pease"/&gt;

The primary objective of roughing is to recover as much of the valuable minerals as possible, with less emphasis on the quality of the concentrate produced.

In some concentrators, there may be a ''preflotation'' step that precedes roughing.&lt;ref name = "Smith"&gt;T Smith, D Lin, B Lacouture and G Anderson, [http://www.jamesoncell.com/EN/Downloads/technical%20papers/Removal%20of%20Organic%20Carbon%20with%20a%20Jameson%20Cell%20at%20R.pdf "Removal of organic carbon with a Jameson Cell at Red Dog Mine,"] in: ''Proceedings of the 40th Annual Meeting of the Canadian Mineral Processors, Ottawa, Ontario, 22–24 January 2008''. Accessed 6 June 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; This is done when there are some undesirable materials, such as organic carbon, that readily float.&lt;ref name = "Smith"/&gt; They are removed first to avoid them floating during roughing (and thus contaminating the rougher concentrate).

====Cleaning====
The rougher concentrate is normally subjected to further stages of flotation to reject more of the undesirable minerals that also reported to the froth, in a process known as ''cleaning''.&lt;ref name = "Pease"/&gt; The product of cleaning is known as the ''cleaner concentrate'' or the ''final concentrate''.

The objective of cleaning is to produce as high a concentrate grade as possible.

The rougher concentrate is often subject to further grinding (usually called ''regrinding'') to get more complete liberation of the valuable minerals.&lt;ref name = "Pease"/&gt; Because it is a smaller mass than that of the original ore, less energy is needed than would be necessary if the whole ore were reground.&lt;ref name = "Pease"/&gt; Regrinding is often undertaken in specialized ''regrind mills'', such as the [[IsaMill]], designed to further reduce the energy consumed during regrinding to finer sizes.

====Scavenging====
The rougher flotation step is often followed by a ''scavenger'' flotation step that is applied to the rougher tailings. The objective is to recover any of the target minerals that were not recovered during the initial roughing stage. This might be achieved by changing the flotation conditions to make them more rigorous than the initial roughing, or there might be some secondary grinding to provide further liberation.

The concentrate from the rougher scavengers could be returned to the rougher feed for refloating or sent to special cleaner cells.

Similarly, the cleaning step may also be followed by a scavenging step performed on the cleaner tailings.

==Science of flotation==
To be effective on a given ore slurry, the collectors are chosen based upon their selective [[wetting]] of the types of particles to be separated.  A good collector will [[adsorb]], physically or chemically, with one of the types of particles. This provides the thermodynamic requirement for the particles to bind to the surface of a bubble.  The wetting activity of a surfactant on a particle can be quantified by measuring the [[contact angle]]s that the liquid/bubble interface makes with it. Another important measure for attachment of bubbles to particles is induction time. The induction time is the time required for the particle and bubble to rupture the thin film separating the particle and bubble. This rupturing is achieved by the surface forces between the particle and bubble.

The mechanisms for the bubble-particle attachment is very complex and consists of three steps, collision, attachment and detachment. The collision is achieved by particles being within the collision tube of a bubble and this is affected by the velocity of the bubble and radius of the bubble. The collision tube corresponds to the region in which a particle will collide with the bubble, with the perimeter of the collision tube corresponding to the grazing trajectory.

The attachment of the particle to the bubble is controlled by the induction time of the particle and bubble. The particle and bubble need to bind and this occurs if the time in which the particle and bubble are in contact with each other is larger than the required induction time. This induction time is affected by the fluid viscosity, particle and bubble size and the forces between the particle and bubbles.

The detachment of a particle and bubble occurs when the force exerted by the surface tension is exceeded by shear forces and gravitational forces. These forces are complex and vary within the cell. High shear will be experienced close to the impeller of a mechanical flotation cell and mostly gravitational force in the collection and cleaning zone of a flotation column.

Significant issues of entrainment of fine particles occurs as these particles experience low collision efficiencies as well as sliming and degradation of the particle surfaces. Coarse particles show a low recovery of the valuable mineral due to the low liberation and high detachment efficiencies.

===Theory===

====Selective adhesion====
Froth flotation depends on the selective adhesion of air bubbles to mineral surfaces in a mineral/water slurry. The air bubbles will attach to more [[hydrophobic]] particles. The attachment of the bubbles to the surface is determined by the interfacial energies between the solid, liquid, and gas phases. This is determined by the [[wetting|Young-Dupré Equation]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kawatra|first1=S.K.|title=Flotation Fundamentals|url=http://www.chem.mtu.edu/chem_eng/faculty/kawatra/Flotation_Fundamentals.pdf|website=MTU Chemistry|accessdate=8 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt; \gamma_{lv} \text{cos} \theta = (\gamma_{sv} - \gamma_{sl})&lt;/math&gt;

where:
* γ&lt;sub&gt;lv&lt;/sub&gt; is the surface energy of the liquid/vapor interface
* γ&lt;sub&gt;sv&lt;/sub&gt; is the surface energy of the solid/vapor interface
* γ&lt;sub&gt;sl&lt;/sub&gt; is the surface energy of the solid/liquid interface,
* θ is the [[contact angle]], the angle formed at the junction between vapor, solid, and liquid phases.

Minerals targeted for separation may be chemically surface-modified with collectors so that they are more hydrophobic. Collectors are a type of [[surfactant]] that increase the natural hydrophobicity of the surface, increasing the [[Separation process|separability]] of the hydrophobic and hydrophilic particles. Collectors either chemically bond via [[chemisorption]] to the mineral or adsorb onto the surface via [[physisorption]].

[[File:Collectors.png|thumb|upright=1.3|Different types of collectors, or surfactants, used in froth flotation.]]

====IMFs and surface forces in bubble-particle interactions====

=====Collision=====
The collision rates for fine particles (50 - 80 μm) can be accurately modeled, but there is no current theory that accurately models bubble-particle collision for particles as large as 300 μm, which are commonly used in flotation processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nguyen|first1=Anh V|title=On modelling of bubble–particle attachment probability in flotation|journal=International Journal of Mineral Processing|date=12 June 1996|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301751697000732|doi=10.1016/S0301-7516(97)00073-2|volume=53|pages=225–249}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For fine particles, [[Stokes' law|Stokes law]] underestimates collision probability while the potential equation based on [[surface charge]] overestimates collision probability so an intermediate equation is used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shahbazi|first1=B.|title=Bubble–particle collision and attachment probability on fine particles flotation|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0255270110001029|journal=Chemical Engineering and Processing: Process Intensification|doi=10.1016/j.cep.2010.04.009|volume=49|pages=622–627}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is important to know the collision rates in the system since this step precedes the adsorption where a three phase system is formed.

=====Adsorption (attachment)=====
The effectiveness of a medium to adsorb to a particle is influenced by the relationship between the surfaces of both materials. There are multiple factors that affect the efficiency of adsorption in chemical, thermodynamic, and physical domains. These factors can range from surface energy and polarity to the shape, size, and roughness of the particle. In froth flotation, adsorption is a strong consequence of surface energy, since the small particles have a high surface area to size ratio, resulting in higher energy surfaces to form attractions with adsorbates. The air bubbles must selectively adhere to the desired minerals to elevate them to the surface of the slurry while wetting the other minerals and leaving them in the aqueous slurry medium.

Particles that can be easily wetted by water are called hydrophilic, while particles that are not easily wetted by water are called hydrophobic. Hydrophobic particles have a tendency to form a separate phase in aqueous media. In froth flotation the effectiveness of an air bubble to adhere to a particle is based on how hydrophobic the particle is. Hydrophobic particles have an affinity to air bubbles, leading to adsorption. The bubble-particle combinations are elevated to the froth zone driven by buoyancy forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kawatra|first1=S.K.|title=Flotation Fundamentals|url=http://www.chem.mtu.edu/chem_eng/faculty/kawatra/Flotation_Fundamentals.pdf|website=MTU Chemistry|accessdate=8 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The attachment of the bubbles to the particles is determined by the interfacial energies of between the solid, liquid, and vapor phases, as modeled by the Young/Dupre Equation. The interfacial energies can be based on the natural structure of the materials, or the addition of chemical treatments can improve energy compatibility.

Collectors are the main additives used to improve particle surfaces. They function as surfactants to selectively isolate and aid adsorption between the particles of interest and bubbles rising through the slurry. Common collectors used in flotation are anionic sulfur ligands, which have a bifunctional structure with an ionic portion which shares attraction with metals, and a hydrophobic portion such as a long hydrocarbon tail. These collectors coat a particle’s surface with a monolayer of non-polar substance to aid separation from the aqueous phase by decreasing the adsorbed particle solubility in water. The adsorbed ligands can form micelles around the particles and form small-particle colloids improving stability and phase separation further.

=====Desorption (detachment)=====
The adsorption of particles to bubbles is essential to separating the minerals from the slurry, but the minerals must be purified from the additives used in separation, such as the collectors, frothers, and modifiers. The product of the cleaning, or desorption process, is known as the cleaner concentrate. 
The detachment of a particle and bubble requires adsorption bond cleavage driven by shear forces. Depending on the flotation cell type, shear forces are applied by a variety of mechanical systems. Among the most common are impellers and mixers. Some systems combine the functionalities of these components by placing them at key locations where they can take part in multiple froth flotation mechanisms. Cleaning cells also take advantage of gravitational forces to improve separation efficiency.

====Performance calculations====

=====Relevant equations=====
A common quantity used to describe the collection efficiency of a froth flotation process is ''flotation recovery'' (&lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;). This quantity incorporates the probabilities of [[Froth flotation#Science of flotation|collision]] and [[Froth flotation#Science of flotation|attachment]] of particles to gas flotation bubbles.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;R = \frac{N_c} {\left(\tfrac{\pi}{4}\right)\left(d_p+d_b\right)^2 Hc}&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
where:
* &lt;math&gt;N_c = PN_c^i&lt;/math&gt;, which is the product of the probability of the particle being collected (&lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;) and the number of possible particle collisions (&lt;math&gt;N_c^i&lt;/math&gt;)
* &lt;math&gt;d_p&lt;/math&gt; is particle diameter
* &lt;math&gt;d_b&lt;/math&gt; is bubble diameter
* &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; is a specified height within the flotation which the recovery was calculated
* &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; is the particle concentration
&lt;br /&gt;
The following, are several additional mathematical methods often used to evaluate the effectiveness of froth flotation processes. These equations are more simple than the calculation for ''flotation recovery'', as they are based solely on the amounts of inputs and outputs of the processes.&lt;ref&gt;Kawatra, S. K. "Froth Flotation – Fundamental Principles." (n.d.): n. pag. Web.&lt;/ref&gt;

For the following equations:
* &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is the weight percent of feed
* &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; is the weight percent concentrate
* &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is the weight percent of tailings
* &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; are the [[metallurgical assay]]s of the concentrate, tailings, and feed, respectively
&lt;br /&gt;
Ratio of feed weight to concentrate weight &lt;math&gt;\tfrac {F}{C}&lt;/math&gt; (unitless)
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt; \frac{F}{C} = \frac{c-t}{f-t}&lt;/math&gt;

Percent of metal recovered (&lt;math&gt;\Chi_R&lt;/math&gt;) in wt''%''
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\Chi_R = 100\left(\frac{c}{f}\right)\left(\frac{f-t}{c-t}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

Percent of metal lost (&lt;math&gt;\Chi_L&lt;/math&gt;) in wt''%''
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\Chi_L = 100 - \Chi_R&lt;/math&gt;

Percent of weight recovered &lt;math&gt;\left(\Chi_W\right)&lt;/math&gt; in wt''%''
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\Chi_W = 100\left(\frac{C}{F}\right) = 100\frac{f-t}{c-t}&lt;/math&gt;

[[File:Shifts_in_Recovery_Curves.png|thumb|Example grade-recovery relationships seen in froth flotation. Shifts in the curves represent changes in flotation effectiveness.]]

=====Grade-recovery curves=====

Grade-recovery curves are useful tools in weighing the trade-off of producing a high grade of concentrate while maintaining as low of a recovery rate as possible, two important aspects of froth flotation. These curves are developed empirically based on the individual froth flotation process of a particular plant. As the curves are shifted in the positive x-direction (to the right) and the positive y-direction (upward) the performance of the froth flotation process is regarded as improving. A disadvantage to these curves is that they can only compare the grade-recovery relations of a specific feed grade and feed rate. If a company has a variance of feed grades and rates used (an extremely common occurrence) in their froth flotation process, grade-recovery curves for every pairing of feed grade and recovery rate would have to be constructed in order to provide meaningful information to the plant.&lt;ref&gt;Neethling, S.j., and J.j. Cilliers. "Grade-recovery Curves: A New Approach for Analysis of and Predicting from Plant Data." ''Minerals Engineering'' 36-38 (2012): 105-10. Web.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Flotation equipment ==
[[Image:FlCell.PNG|thumb|240px|right|Diagram of froth flotation cell. Numbered triangles show direction of stream flow.  A mixture of ore and water called pulp [1] enters the cell from a conditioner, and flows to the bottom of the cell.  Air [2] or nitrogen is passed down a vertical impeller where shearing forces break the air stream into small bubbles.  The mineral concentrate froth is collected from the top of the cell [3], while the pulp [4] flows to another cell.]]

Flotation can be performed in rectangular or cylindrical mechanically agitated cells or tanks, flotation columns, [[Jameson Cell]]s or deinking flotation machines. Classified by the method of air absorption manner, it is fair to state that two distinct groups of flotation equipments have arisen:pneumatic and mechanical machines. Generally pneumatic machines give a low-grade concentrate and little operating troubles.
[[File:Jameson Cells pictured adjacent to flotation columns at the Mount Isa lead-zinc concentrator.png|thumbnail|left|Comparison of the sizes of flotation columns and [[Jameson Cell]]s with similar capacities.]]

Mechanical cells use a large mixer and diffuser mechanism at the bottom of the mixing tank to introduce air and provide mixing action.  '''Flotation columns''' use air [[Sparging (chemistry)|sparger]]s to introduce air at the bottom of a tall column while introducing slurry above.  The countercurrent motion of the slurry flowing down and the air flowing up provides mixing action.  Mechanical cells generally have a higher throughput rate, but produce material that is of lower quality, while flotation columns generally have a low throughput rate but produce higher quality material.

The Jameson cell uses neither impellers nor spargers, instead combining the slurry with air in a downcomer where high shear creates the turbulent conditions required for bubble particle contacting.

== Mechanics of flotation ==
[[Image:FlCirc.PNG|thumb|300px|right]]
The following steps are followed, following grinding to liberate the mineral particles:
# Reagent conditioning to achieve hydrophobic surface charges on the desired particles
# Collection and upward transport by bubbles in an intimate contact with air or nitrogen
# Formation of a stable froth on the surface of the flotation cell
# Separation of the mineral laden froth from the bath (flotation cell)

'''Simple flotation circuit for mineral concentration.'''  Numbered triangles show direction of stream flow.  Various flotation reagents are added to a mixture of ore and water (called pulp) in a conditioning tank.  The flow rate and tank size are designed to give the minerals enough time to be activated.  The conditioner pulp [1] is fed to a bank of rougher cells which remove most of the desired minerals as a concentrate.  The rougher pulp [2] passes to a bank of scavenger cells where additional reagents may be added.  The scavenger cell froth [3] is usually returned to the rougher cells for additional treatment, but in some cases may be sent to special cleaner cells.  The scavenger pulp is usually barren enough to be discarded as tails.  More complex flotation circuits have several sets of cleaner and re-cleaner cells, and intermediate re-grinding of pulp or concentrate.

===Water===

===Collectors===
For many ores (e.g. those of Cu, Mo, W, Ni), the collectors are anionic sulfur ligands.  Particularly popular are [[xanthate]] salts, including potassium amyl xanthate (PAX), potassium isobutyl xanthate (PIBX), [[potassium ethyl xanthate]] (KEX), [[sodium isobutyl xanthate]] (SIBX), [[sodium isopropyl xanthate]] (SIPX), [[sodium ethyl xanthate]] (SEX).  Other collectors include related sulfur-based ligands: [[dithiophosphate]]s, [[dithiocarbamate]]s.  Still other classes of collectors include the [[thiourea]] [[thiocarbanilide]].  [[Fatty acid]]s have also been used.

For some minerals (e.g., [[sylvanite]] for KCl), [[fatty amine]]s are used as collectors.

A variety of compounds are added to stabilize the foams.  These additives include [[pine oil]], various [[alcohol]]s ([[4-Methyl-2-pentanol|methyl isobutyl carbinol (MIBC)]]), [[Polyethylene glycol|polyglycols]], [[xylenol]] (cresylic acid).

===Modifiers===

The crushed mineral is suspended in brine in the presence of [[fatty amine|fatty ammonium]] salts.  Because the ammonium group and K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; have very similar ionic radii (ca. 0.135, 0.143&amp;nbsp;nm respectively), the ammonium centers exchange for the surface potassium sites on the particles of KCl, but not on the NaCl particles.  The long [[alkyl]] chains then confer hydrophobicity, to the particles, which enable them to form foams.&lt;ref name=Ullmann&gt;Elizabeth R.

The '''Functional Independence Measure''' ('''FIM''') is an assessment tool that aims to evaluate the functional status of patients throughout the rehabilitation process following a [[stroke]], [[traumatic brain injury]], [[spinal cord injury]] or [[cancer]].&lt;ref name=Chumney&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1682/JRRD.2009.08.0140 |title=Ability of Functional Independence Measure to accurately predict functional outcome of stroke-specific population: Systematic review |year=2010 |last1=Chumney |first1=Douglas |last2=Nollinger |first2=Kristen |last3=Shesko |first3=Kristina |last4=Skop |first4=Karen |last5=Spencer |first5=Madeleine |last6=Newton |first6=Roberta A. |journal=The Journal of Rehabilitation Research and Development |volume=47|issue=1 |pages=17–30|url=http://www.rehab.research.va.gov/jour/10/471/pdf/chumney.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Its area of use can include skilled nursing facilities and hospitals aimed at acute, sub-acute and rehabilitation care. Performed on admission to and departure from a [[rehabilitation hospital]], it serves as a consistent data collection tool for the comparison of rehabilitation outcomes across the health care continuum.&lt;ref name=Chumney /&gt; Furthermore, it aims to allow clinicians to track changes in the functional status of patients from the onset of rehab care through discharge and follow-up. The FIM's assessment of degree of [[disability]] depends on the patient's score in 18 categories, focusing on motor and cognitive function. Each category or item is rated on a 7-point scale (1 = &lt;25% independence; total assistance required, 7 = 100% independence).&lt;ref name=Chumney /&gt;&lt;ref name="assess"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Furlan|first1=JC|last2=Noonan|first2=V|last3=Singh|first3=A|last4=Fehlings|first4=MG|title=Assessment of disability in patients with acute traumatic spinal cord injury: a systematic review of the literature.|journal=Journal of Neurotrauma|date=August 2011|volume=28|issue=8|pages=1413–30|pmid=20367251|doi=10.1089/neu.2009.1148|pmc=3143412}}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, FIM scores may be interpreted to indicate level of independence or level of burden of care.  The scale is used to assess how well a person can carry out basic [[activities of daily living]] and thus how dependent he or she will be on help from others.&lt;ref name=Chumney /&gt;  Other areas assessed include the physical like how well patients move and walk, and the cognitive, how well they interact with others, communicate, and process information.&lt;ref name="assess" /&gt;  FIM was originally made for people who had had strokes, but is used to assess disability in other cases as well.&lt;ref name="assess" /&gt;

'''Gluconasturtiin''' ('''phenethylglucosinolate''') is one of the most widely distributed [[glucosinolate]]s in the [[cruciferous vegetables]], mainly in the roots, and is probably one of the plant compounds responsible for the natural pest-inhibiting properties of growing crucifers, such as cabbage, mustard or rape, in rotation with other crops. This effect of gluconasturtiin is most likely due to its degradation by the plant enzyme [[myrosinase]] into [[phenethyl isothiocyanate]], which is toxic to many organisms.

Gluconasturtiin is named from its occurrence in [[watercress]] (''Nasturtium officinale''). Among the vegetables, it is also found in [[horseradish]] (''Armoracia rusticana'') along with [[sinigrin]]. Both compounds elicit a [[pungent]] taste.&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} RICHARD H. Arômes alimentaires [http://www.cnrs.fr/chimie/communication/images/images-chimietous/minidossiers/cours%20aromes_hubert%20richard.pdf PDF Document] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070214074448/http://www.cnrs.fr/chimie/communication/images/images-chimietous/minidossiers/cours%20aromes_hubert%20richard.pdf |date=February 14, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In one investigation of horseradish roots, sinigrin concentration represented 83% and gluconasturtiin 11% of the extracted glucosinolates.&lt;ref&gt; XIAN LI, KUSHAD MM (2004) Correlation of glucosinolate content to myrosinase activity in horseradish (Armoracia rusticana).''

The [[Chernobyl disaster]], ({{lang-uk|Чорнобильська катастрофа}}) ''Chornobylʹsʹka katastrofa,'' was a [[nuclear accident]] that occurred on 26 April 1986 at the [[Chernobyl Nuclear Power Station|Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant]] in the [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic]] (then part of the [[Soviet Union]]), now in [[Ukraine]]. The following is the individual involvement in the accident.
&lt;!-- [[File:Chernobyl firemens memorial.jpg|thumb|Chernobyl firemen memorial]]todo: copy file from Hungarian wiki, http://hu.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=F%C3%A1jl:Chernobyl_firemens_memorial.jpg --&gt;

:'''''Notice''': Most of the information here is based on Grigoriy Medvedev's work''.&lt;ref name="medv"/&gt;

In the night from 25 to 26 April, in the two power plant complexes, there were 160 people on duty, including technicians and maintenance personnel of the various departments. Three hundred more workers were present at the building site of the third complex of the blocks 5 and 6.

== Individual actions ==
=== Nikolai Gorbachenko ===
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2013}}
Gorbachenko, a radiation monitoring technician, at the beginning of his shift checked Unit 3; he skipped the check of Unit 4 as it was being shut down, so at the moment of the accident he was located in the duty room. A flat and powerful thud shook the building; he and his assistant Pshenichnikov thought it was a [[water hammer]] occurring during a turbine shutdown. Another flat thud followed, accompanied by lights going out, the control panel of Unit 4 losing signal, latched double doors being blown apart by the blast, and black and red powder falling from the ventilation vent; emergency lights then switched on. Telephone connection with Unit 4 was cut. The corridor to the deaerator galleries was full of steam and white dust. The radiation counters went off-scale, and the high-range one burned out when switched on; the portable instruments were capable of showing at most 4&amp;nbsp;roentgens per hour (36 nA/kg), while the radiation on the roof ranged between 2,000 and 15,000&amp;nbsp;roentgens per hour (18 and 130&amp;nbsp;µA/kg). He went to the turbine hall to survey the damage, saw scattered pieces of concrete, and returned to the duty room. Meeting two men there, together with them he went to search for Shashenok, found him unconscious in a damaged instrument room, and carried him down. Gorbachenko returned to his post and changed clothes and shoes. He was then ordered to look for Khodemchuk, but the search was unsuccessful. He went to the control room and with Dyatlov went outside to survey the reactor building. At 5:00&amp;nbsp;am, he began feeling weak and vomiting and was transported to hospital, from where he was released on 27 October.

=== Valery Khodemchuk ===
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2013}}
The night shift main circulating pump operator, Khodemchuk, was likely killed immediately; he was located in the collapsed part of the building, in the far end of the southern main circulating pumps engine room at level +10. His body was never recovered and is entombed in the reactor debris.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History does not know the words 'too late' - Publications. Materials about: Pripyat, Chernobyl accident|url=http://pripyat.com/en/publications/2008/12/29/1979.html|publisher=pripyat.com|accessdate=2013-07-10|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100820124650/http://pripyat.com/en/publications/2008/12/29/1979.html|archivedate=2010-08-20|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Vladimir Shashenok ===
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2013}}
Shashenok, the automatic systems adjuster from ''Atomenergonaladka'' (the Chernobyl startup and adjustment enterprise), was supposed to be in Room 604, the location of the measurement and control instruments,&lt;!-- КИП - контрольно-измерительных приборов --&gt; on the upper landing across the turbine room, on level +24, under the reactor feedwater unit; he was reporting the states of the pressure gauges of the profile of the multiple forced circulation circuit &lt;!-- КМПЦ - контура многократной принудительной циркуляции --&gt; to the computer room by telephone. The communication lines were cut during the explosion. Shashenok received deep thermal and radiation burns over his entire body when the overpressure spike destroyed the isolation membranes and the impulse pipes of the [[manometer]]s in his instrument room just before the explosion, which then demolished the room itself. The landing was found damaged, covered with ankle-deep water, and there were leaks of boiling water and radioactive steam. Shashenok was found unconscious in Room 604, pinned under a fallen beam, with bloody foam coming out of his mouth. His body was severely contaminated by radioactive water. He was carried out by Gorbachenko and Palamarchuk and died at 6:00&amp;nbsp;am in the Pripyat hospital under care of the chief physician, Leonenko Vitaliy, without regaining consciousness. Gorbachenko suffered a radiation burn on his back where Shashenok's hand was located when he helped carry him out. Khodemchuk and Shashenok were the first two victims of the disaster.

=== Oleg Genrikh, Anatoly Kurguz ===
Genrikh, an operator of the control room on Level +36, was taking a nap in a windowless room adjacent to the control room. The window in the control room was broken and the lights went out. His colleague Kurguz was in the control room with three open doors between him and the reactor room; at the moment of the explosion, he suffered severe burns from steam entering the control room. Genrikh received less serious burns as he was protected by the windowless room. The stairs on the right side were damaged; he managed to escape by the stairs on the left.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=O36UC03ODtcC&amp;pg=PA30&amp;lpg=PA30&amp;dq=%22oleg+heinrich%22|title=Chernobyl record: the definitive ... - Google Books|publisher=Books.google.cz|date=1986-04-26|accessdate=2010-03-22|isbn=9781420034622}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the way back they were joined by Simeonov and Simonenko, the gas loop operators, all four heading to the control room. Kurguz was shortly afterwards evacuated by an ambulance; aware of dangers of radiation contamination, Genrikh took a shower and changed his clothes.

=== Aleksandr Yuvchenko ===
Yuvchenko was located in his office between reactors 3 and 4, on Level 12.5; he described the event as a shock wave that buckled walls, blew doors in, and brought a cloud of milky grey radioactive dust and steam. The lights went out. He met a badly burned, drenched and shocked pump operator, who asked him to rescue Khodemchuk; that quickly proved impossible as that part of the building did not exist anymore. Yuvchenko, together with the foreman Yuri Tregub, ran out of the building and saw half of the building gone and the reactor emitting a [[ionized air glow|blue glow of ionized air]]. They returned to the building and met Valeri Perevozchenko and two junior technicians, Kudryavtsev and Proskuryakov, ordered by Dyatlov or Akimov to manually lower the presumably seized control rods. Tregub went to report the extent of damage to the control room. Despite Yuvchenko's explanation that there were no control rods left, the four climbed a stairwell to Level 35 to survey the damage; Yuvchenko held open the massive door into the reactor room and the other three proceeded in to locate the control rod mechanism; after no more than a minute of surveying the reactor debris, enough for all three to sustain fatal doses of radiation, they returned, their skin darkened with "nuclear tan" in reaction to the high radiation dose. The three were the first to die in the Moscow hospital. Yuvchenko meanwhile suffered serious [[beta burn]]s and gamma burns to his left shoulder, hip and calf as he kept the radioactive-dust-covered door open. It was later estimated he received a dose of 4.1&amp;nbsp;[[Sievert|Sv]]. At 3:00&amp;nbsp;am, he began vomiting intensely; by 6:00&amp;nbsp;am, he could no longer walk. He later spent a year in the Moscow hospital receiving blood and plasma transfusions and received numerous skin grafts.&lt;ref name="nuclruss"&gt;{{cite news|author=Adam Higginbotham|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/mar/26/nuclear.russia|title=Adam Higginbotham: Chernobyl 20 years on &amp;#124; World news &amp;#124; The Observer|publisher=[[The Guardian]]|date=2006-03-26|accessdate=2010-03-22|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.flatrock.org.nz/topics/money_politics_law/cheating_chernobyl.htm |title=80 Miles North of Kiev |publisher=Flatrock.org.nz |date= |accessdate=2010-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- not mentioned by Medvedev, amount of people going to the reactor is 3 here instead of 2, trainees ordered by Dyatlov instead of by Akimov. --&gt;

=== Valeriy Perevozchenko ===
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2013}}
Perevozchenko, the reactor section foreman, was present on the open platform at Level +50 shortly before the explosion. He witnessed the 350&amp;nbsp;kg blocks atop the fuel channels of the Upper Biological Shield jumping up and down and felt the shock waves through the building structure; the rupture of the pressure channels was in progress. He ran down the spiral staircase to Level +10, through the [[deaerator]] gallery and the corridor to the [[control room]], to report his observations, arriving shortly after the explosions, then returned to search for his comrades. He witnessed the destruction of the reactor building from the broken windows of the deaerator gallery. With his face already tanned by the radiation, he went to the dosimetry room and asked Gorbachenko for radiation levels; Gorbachenko left with Palamarchuk to rescue Shashenok while Perevozchenko went through the graphite and fuel containing radioactive rubble on Level 10 to the remains of Room 306 in an unsuccessful attempt to locate Khodemchuk, close to debris emitting over 10,000&amp;nbsp;roentgens per hour (90&amp;nbsp;µA/kg). He then went to the control room of Genrikh and Kurguz and found it empty; vomiting and losing consciousness, he returned to the control room to report on the situation.

=== Vyacheslav Brazhnik, Pyotr Palamarchuk, Razim Davletbayev ===
Brazhnik, the senior turbine machinist operator, ran into the control room to report fire in the turbine hall. Palamarchuk, the Chernobyl enterprise group supervisor, together with Davletbayev, followed him back to the turbine room. They witnessed fires on Levels 0 and +12, broken oil and water pipes, roof debris on top of turbine 7, and scattered pieces of reactor graphite and fuel, with the [[linoleum]] on the floor burning around them. Palamarchuk unsuccessfully attempted to contact Sashenok in Room 604, then ran around the turbogenerator 8, down to Level 0 and urged the two men from the Kharkov mobile laboratory, assigned to record the turbine 8 vibrations, to leave; they, however, had both already received a lethal radiation dose. Akimov asked Palamarchuk to look for Gorbachenko and then rescue Sashenok as the communication with the dosimetry room was cut. Palamarchuk met Gorbachenko by the staircase on Level +27, then they together found and recovered Shashenok's unconscious body.&lt;ref name="medv"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://handle.dtic.mil/100.2/ADA335076|title=JPRS Report}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Aleksandr Kudryavtsev, Viktor Proskuryakov ===
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2013}}
Kudryavtsev and Proskuryakov, the SIUR trainees from other shifts, were present to watch Toptunov and learn. After the explosion they were sent by Dyatlov or Akimov to the central hall to turn the handles of the system for manual lowering of the presumably seized control rods. They ran through the de-aerator gallery to the right to the VRSO unit elevator, found it destroyed, so climbed up the staircase instead, towards Level 36; they missed Kurguz and Genrikh, who used another stairwell. Level 36 was destroyed, covered with rubble. They went through a narrow corridor towards the central hall, entered the reactor hall, and found it blocked with rubble and fragments; dangling [[fire hose]]s were pouring water into the remains of the reactor core, the firemen not there anymore. The Upper Biological Shield was slanted, jammed into the reactor shaft; a blue and red fire raged in the hole. The minute the two stood above the reactor was enough to darken their bodies with "nuclear tan" and give them a fatal radiation dose. They returned to Level 10 and to the control room, reporting the situation; Dyatlov insisted they were wrong, assuming the explosion had been caused by hydrogen-oxygen mixture in the 110&amp;nbsp;m³ emergency tank and the reactor itself was intact.

=== Anatoly Dyatlov ===
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2013}}
[[Anatoly Dyatlov]], the deputy chief engineer, supervised the test. At the moment reactor power slipped to 30MW, he insisted the operators continue the test. He overrode Akimov's and Toptunov's objections, threatening to hand the shift to Tregub (the previous shift operator who had remained on-site), intimidating them into attempting to increase the reactor power. During this period of time the reactor protection system was vetoed to prevent automatic shutdown of the reactor. The power stabilized at 200MW at around 1:00&amp;nbsp;am and did not rise further, due to continued xenon poisoning of the core. Later the test was commenced, then the reactor showed power excursion and was scrammed. As the control rods dropped into the core, their design (which incorporated a graphite plug at the bottom of each rod) introduced additional moderation and hence reactivity into the reactor system. The explosion occurred as the control rods were falling, and the subsequent damage prevented insertion into the reactor. Dyatlov ordered reactor cooling with emergency speed, assuming the reactor was intact and the explosion had been caused by hydrogen accumulating in the emergency tank of the safety control system. Other employees went to the control room, reporting damage. Dyatlov went to the backup control room, pressing the AZ-5 button there and disconnecting power to the control rod servodrives; despite seeing the graphite blocks scattered on the ground outside the plant, he still believed the reactor was intact. Kudryavtsev and Proskuryakov returned to report the reactor damage they had seen, but Dyatlov insisted what they had seen was the results of an explosion of the emergency tank, claiming the explosion of the 110&amp;nbsp;m³ tank at Level +71 was sufficient to destroy the central hall roof. Dyatlov reported his assumptions as reality to Bryukhanov and Fomin, the higher-level managers. In the corridor, he met Genrikh and Kurguz and sent them to the medical station. He ran to the control room of Block 3, ordered Bagdasarov to shut down Reactor 3, then returned to control room 4 and ordered Akimov to call the daytime shift and get people to the affected unit; namely Lelechenko, whose crew had to remove hydrogen from the Generator 8 electrolyzer. At 2:00, Dyatlov ordered Akimov to feed water to the reactor, and together with Gorbachenko went to survey the plant from the outside. Despite seeing the fuel and graphite scattered around, he still believed the reactor was intact. They then returned to the control room. At 5:00&amp;nbsp;am, he got sick and together with Gorbachenko went to the medical unit. Fomin replaced him at his post with Sitnikov.

=== Aleksandr Akimov ===
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2013}}
[[Aleksandr Akimov]], the unit shift chief, was in charge of the test itself. He took over the shift at midnight from Tregub, who stayed on-site. The drop in reactor power from 1500&amp;nbsp;MWt to 30&amp;nbsp;MWt was disconcerting; he wanted to abort the test. He supported Toptunov's decision to shut down the poisoned reactor, but was over-ridden by Dyatlov and forced to continue. At 1:23:04 am the test began, and the main circulation pumps started cavitating due to the too high temperature of inlet water. The coolant started boiling in the reactor, and the reactor power slowly increased. Toptunov reported a power excursion to Akimov. At 1:23:40, Akimov pressed the AZ-5 button, class-5 emergency. The control rods, according to the [[synchro]] indicators, seized at a depth of between 2 and 2.5&amp;nbsp;meters instead of the entire core depth of 7&amp;nbsp;meters. Akimov disconnected the [[clutch]]es of the control rod servos to let the rods descend into the core by their own weight, but the rods did not move. The reactor was now making rumbling noises. Akimov was confused. The reactor control panel indicated no water flow and failure of pumps. The explosion occurred, the air filled with dust, power went out, and only battery-powered emergency lights stayed in operation. Perevozchenko ran into the control room, reporting the collapse of the reactor top. Brazhnik ran in from the turbine hall, reporting fire there. Brazhki, Akimov, Davletbayev, and Palamarchuk ran into the turbine hall, having seen scattered debris and multiple fires on Levels 0 and +12. Akimov called the fire station and the chiefs of electrical and other departments, asking for electrical power for coolant pumps, removal of hydrogen from hydrogen generators, and other emergency procedures to stabilize the plant and contain the damage. Internal telephone lines were disabled; Akimov sent Palamarchuk to contact Gorbachenko. Kudryavtsev and Proskuryakov returned from the reactor and reported its state to Akimov and Dyatlov. Insisting the reactor was intact, Akimov ordered Stolyarchuk and Busygin to turn on the emergency feedwater pumps. Davletbayev reported loss of electrical power, torn cables, and electric arcs. Akimov sent Metlenko to help in the turbine hall with manual opening of the cooling system valves, which was expected to take at least four hours per valve. Perevozchenko returned and reported that the reactor was destroyed, but Akimov insisted it was intact. At 3:30&amp;nbsp;am, Telyatnikov contacted Akimov, asking what was happening to his firemen; Akimov sent him a dosimetrist. Akimov, already nauseous, was replaced at 6:00&amp;nbsp;am by the unit chief Vladimir Alekseyevich Babychev, but together with Toptunov stayed in the plant. Believing the water flow to the reactor to be blocked by a closed valve somewhere, they went to the half-destroyed feedwater room on Level +24. Together with Nekhayev, Orlov, and Uskov, they opened the valves on the two feedwater lines, then climbed over to Level +27 and almost knee-deep in a mixture of fuel and water, opened two valves on the 300 line; due to advancing radiation poisoning caused by a dose of over 15 [[Gray (unit)|Gray]]s (4 being the [[LD50]]), they did not have the strength to open the valves on the sides. Akimov and Toptunov spent several hours turning valves; the radioactive water in Room 712 was half submerging the pipeline. Smagin went in to open the third valves, spent 20 minutes in the room, and received 280&amp;nbsp;rads. Akimov was evacuated to the hospital. Until his death, he insisted he had done everything correctly and had made no mistakes.

=== Viktor Bryukhanov ===
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2013}}
Bryukhanov, the plant manager, arrived at 2:30&amp;nbsp;am. Akimov reported a serious radiation accident but intact reactor, fires in the process of being extinguished, and a second emergency water pump being readied to cool the reactor. Due to limitations of available instruments, they seriously underestimated the radiation level. At 3:00&amp;nbsp;am, Bryukhanov called Maryin, the deputy secretary for the nuclear power industry, reporting Akimov's version of the situation. Maryin sent the message further up the chain of command, to Frolyshev, who then called [[Vladimir Dolgikh]], who called [[Mikhail Gorbachev|Gorbachev]] and other members of the [[Politburo]]. At 4:00&amp;nbsp;am, Moscow ordered feeding of water to the reactor. As Director of the Chernobyl site he was imprisoned for ten years.

=== Nikolai Fomin ===
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2013}}
Chief engineer Fomin arrived in the Block 4 control room at 4:30. Akimov reported an intact reactor and explosion of the emergency water feed tank. He ordered continuous feeding of water into the reactor, which was already in progress by emergency pump 2 from the deaerators. Fomin kept pressing the staff to feed water to the reactor and transferred more people to Unit 4 to replace those being disabled by radiation. After Dyatlov left, Fomin ordered Sitnikov, his replacement, to climb to the roof of Unit C and survey the reactor; Sitnikov obeyed and received a fatal radiation dose there; at 10:00&amp;nbsp;am he returned and reported to Fomin and Bryukhanov that the reactor was destroyed. The managers refused to believe him and ordered continued feeding of water into the reactor; the water, however, flowed through the severed pipes into the lower levels of the plant, carrying radioactive debris and causing short circuits in the cableways common to all four blocks.
Later, before trial he had a mental breakdown and tried to kill himself. Fomin had broken his glasses and slit his wrists with the shards, but they saved his life.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16539">'''Intermittent preventive therapy''' or '''intermittent preventive treatment''' ('''IPT''') is a [[public health]] intervention aimed at treating and preventing [[malaria]] episodes in infants (IPTi), children (IPTc), schoolchildren (IPTsc) and pregnant women (IPTp). The intervention builds on two tested malaria control strategies to clear existing parasites (treatment effect seen in [[mass drug administration]]s) and to prevent new infections ([[prophylaxis]]).

==IPTi==

IPTi using the antimalarial drug [[sulfadoxine]]/[[pyrimethamine]] (S/P) was pioneered in Ifakara, Tanzania in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;Schellenberg D, Menendez C, Kahigwa E, Aponte J, Vidal J, Tanner M, et al. Intermittent treatment for malaria and anaemia control at time of routine vaccinations in Tanzanian infants: a randomised, placebo-controlled trial. Lancet 2001;357(9267):1471-7&lt;/ref&gt; Infants received S/P at ages 3, 6, and 9 months in combination with their routine childhood (EPI) vaccinations. IPTi reduced clinical attacks of malaria by 59% (95% CI, 41%–72%) in Ifakara. Remarkably, protection persisted throughout the second year of life, long after SP had disappeared from circulation.&lt;ref&gt;Schellenberg D, Menendez C, Aponte JJ, Kahigwa E, Tanner M, Mshinda H, et al. Intermittent preventive antimalarial treatment for Tanzanian infants: follow-up to age 2 years of a randomised, placebo-controlled trial. Lancet 2005;365(9469):1481-3&lt;/ref&gt; A trial conducted in northern Tanzania using the antimalarial drug amodiaquine instead of S/P was similarly successful.&lt;ref&gt;Massaga JJ, Kitua AY, Lemnge MM, Akida JA, Malle LN, Ronn AM, et al. Effect of intermittent treatment with amodiaquine on anaemia and malarial fevers in infants in Tanzania: a randomised placebo-controlled trial. Lancet 2003;361(9372):1853-60&lt;/ref&gt; Six subsequent trials showed less encouraging results.&lt;ref&gt;Chandramohan D, Owusu-Agyei S, Carneiro I, Awine T, Amponsa-Achiano K, Mensah N, et al.

Antimicrob Agents Chemother 2007;51(9):3273-81&lt;/ref&gt;

The latest and so far largest IPTi study was an effectiveness study conducted in the South East of Tanzania.&lt;ref&gt;Armstrong Schellenberg, J.R., et al., Community effectiveness of Intermittent Preventive Treatment for infants (IPTi) in rural southern Tanzania. Am J Trop Med Hyg, 2010. 82(5): p. 772-81.&lt;/ref&gt; A study area of approximately 250x180km2 with a population of about 900,000 people was subdivided into 24 similar clusters. Half of the 23,400 infants, those residing in 12 of 24 randomly selected clusters were invited in 2005 to receive IPTi. Between 47 and 76% of the eligible infants in each of the 12 selected clusters received IPT-SP. In the following year, 2006, the effect of IPTi on malaria and anaemia was assessed in a representative sample of 600 infants. An intention to treat analysis, which includes all eligible infants did not show a statistically significant benefit of IPTi-SP. Parasitaemia prevalence was 31% in the intervention and 38% in the comparison areas (p=0.06). In a ‘per protocol’ analysis, which only included infants who actually received IPTi there was a significant benefit: parasite prevalence was 22%, 19 percentage points lower than comparison children in the control group (p=0.01). This trial showed that IPTi has a protective effect at the individual level but is not effective at the community level. The study had followed up children for two years until 2007 but the findings from the surveillance in 2007 have not been reported.

==IPTc==
Treating children with S/P and artesunate in Senegal where malaria is highly seasonal repeatedly during the malaria season reduced malaria attacks by 86% (95% CI 80-90)9.&lt;ref&gt;.Cisse B, Sokhna C, Boulanger D, Milet J, Ba el H, Richardson K, et al.

==IPTp==
IPTp consists in the administration of a single curative dose of an efficacious anti-malarial drug at least twice during pregnancy – regardless whether or not the woman is infected. The drug is administered under supervision during antenatal care (ANC) visits. Sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine is the drug currently recommended by the WHO because of its safety and efficacy in pregnancy.&lt;ref&gt;WHO.

Ann Trop Med Parasitol 1998;92(2):141-50&lt;/ref&gt; More recent findings from Tanzania also suggest that IPTp using S/P has reached the end of its lifecycle.&lt;ref&gt;Harrington WE, Mutabingwa TK, Muehlenbachs A, Sorensen B, Bolla MC, Fried M, et al. Competitive facilitation of drug-resistant Plasmodium falciparum malaria parasites in pregnant women who receive preventive treatment. Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A 2009;106(22):9027-32&lt;/ref&gt; The authors found that the "use of partially effective anti-malarial agents for IPTp may exacerbate malaria infections in the setting of widespread drug resistance". As for infants, there is no simple readily available replacement of S/P for malaria in pregnancy. Indeed, the fear of teratogenic effects add a layer of complexity how this intervention will evolve.

==Controversy==

While some controversial aspects e.g. the drug of choice are shared by all forms of intermittent preventive therapy, the controversy has been reported in greatest detail for IPTi (see also politics below). The reasons which make the large scale introduction of IPTi highly controversial include:&lt;ref&gt;Intermittent preventive antimalarial treatment in infancy. Lancet 2008;372(9647):1383-4&lt;/ref&gt;

# The six studies reported subsequent to the first 2 IPTi studies did not confirm the same degree of protection against malaria (59%) nor the protracted period of protective benefit (into the second year of life) seen in that initial study. Subsequent studies indicated that protection lasted about 35 days after each treatment dose, which translates into an overall protective efficacy in infancy of 20–33%.
# Effects on anaemia and hospital admission were inconsistent between study sites.
# There was no evidence of mortality reduction. In more than 8,000 children enrolled in IPTi studies, there were 152 deaths in the placebo groups and 157 deaths in the sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine groups: a protective efficacy of –2% (95% CI –22 to 21).
# There were concerns that any benefits shown in these IPTi-SP trials might be less now that resistance to sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine has worsened. A recent trial of S/P conducted in Tanzania had to be closed early because of high mortality in children receiving S/P.&lt;ref&gt;:Gesase S, Gosling RD, Hashim R, Ord R, Naidoo I, Madebe R, et al. High resistance of Plasmodium falciparum to sulphadoxine/pyrimethamine in northern Tanzania and the emergence of dhps resistance mutation at Codon 581. [[PLoS ONE]] 2009;4(2):e4569&lt;/ref&gt;
# There was uncertainty over the true incidence of serious adverse effects, notably the cutaneous reactions that stopped the use of sulfadoxine pyrimethamine as prophylaxis.

An added theoretical concern is that the widespread use of antimalarial drugs for prophylaxis will add to the already considerable drug pressure and will facilitate the emergence and spread of drug resistance. McGready summarised IPTi as an intervention which uses the wrong drug, probably in the wrong dose in the wrong age group.&lt;ref&gt;McGready, R., Intermittent preventive treatment of malaria in infancy. Lancet, 2009. 9700(374): p. 1478-80.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Politics==
The politics of IPTi are well documented and illustrate the working of contemporary international health politics. The promising results of the first two IPTi studies led to the creation of the IPTi Consortium, whose brief is to determine the efficacy, safety, relation of efficacy to drug sensitivity, cost-effectiveness, and acceptability of this intervention.&lt;ref&gt;.Schellenberg D, Cisse B, Menendez C. The IPTi Consortium: research for policy and action. Trends Parasitol 2006;22(7):296-300&lt;/ref&gt; The IPTi Consortium received approximately US$28 million from the [[Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation]] (BMGF). A [[WHO]] technical advisory group reviewed the evidence relevant for the widespread  introduction of IPTi  available in 2008, and came to the conclusion that the available evidence was not sufficient to recommend the widespread introduction of IPTi -SP. Program officers of the BMGF as well as scientists funded by the BMGF criticised the WHO conclusions. The criticism from the BMGF in turn triggered a memorandum of the WHO malaria chief Dr. Akira Kochi to the director general of the WHO which was leaked to ''The New York Times''.&lt;ref&gt;New York Times, February 16, 2008 Gates Foundation's Influence Criticized  By DONALD G. McNEIL Jr.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|text=Dr. Kochi wrote, although it was less and less straightforward  that the health agency should recommend IPTi, the agency's objections were met with intense and aggressive opposition from Gates-backed scientists and the foundation. The W.H.O., he wrote, needs to stand up to such pressures and ensure that the review of evidence is rigorously independent of vested interests.}}

At the request of Dr. Brandling-Bennett of the BMGF and with funding from the BMGF, the [[Institute of Medicine]] (IOM) convened an expert committee to evaluate the evidence concerning IPTi - SP and provide guidance on the value of continued investment in IPTi-SP. The committee was chaired by Myron M. Levine who has been funded and is currently funded by the BMGF. The committee concluded "… that an intervention with results of this magnitude is worthy of further investment as part of a public health strategy to decrease morbidity from malaria infections in infants."&lt;ref&gt;Committee on the Perspectives on the Role of Intermittent Preventive Treatment for Malaria in Infants. Assessment of the role of intermittent preventive treatment for malaria in infants: letter report. Washington, DC:Institute f Medicine, 2008. http://www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=12180&lt;/ref&gt; The WHO technical expert group responded to the IOM report "WHO is committed to review the available information each year." Dr. Kochi was ultimately replaced by one of the members of the IPTi consortium, Dr. Robert Newman. In March 2010, i.e. after Dr. Kochi had been replaced, the WHO recommended the co-administration of the antimalarial drug sulfadoxine pyrimethamine with routine childhood vaccinations ([[DPT vaccine|DTP2, DTP3]] and measles immunization) in sub-Saharan Africa.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.who.int/malaria/news/policy_recommendation_IPTi_032010/en/index.html&lt;/ref&gt; The recommendation applies only for areas with high malaria transmission and low resistance against SP, both measures are not free of controversy and only available for few spots in Africa.

'''Interventional magnetic resonance imaging''', also '''Interventional MRI''' or '''IMRI''', is the use of [[magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI) to do [[interventional radiology]] procedures.

Because of the lack of harmful effects on the patient and the operator, MR is well suited for "interventional radiology", where the images produced by an MRI scanner are used to guide a minimally-invasive procedure intraoperatively and/or interactively. Interventional MRI can be used for a variety of specialized procedures. iMRI systems are often used for doing biopsies of lesions, resections of tumors, guiding thermal ablation of tissue, as well as other procedures. It is commonly used in [[neurosurgery]] where every millimeter of tissue spared in surgery can make a difference for patient recovery.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ajnr.org/content/20/5/735.full&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:IMRI suite.jpg|thumb|left|The iMRI suite at [[The Canberra Hospital]].]]
The non-magnetic environment required by the scanner and the strong magnetic radiofrequency and quasi-static fields generated by the scanner hardware require the use of specialized instruments. For example, use of non-magnetic (e.g. [[Titanium]]) surgical instruments and MR compatible patient surveillance accessories in addition to the MRI scanner itself increase the cost of IMRI. Often required is the use of an "open bore" magnet, which permits the operating staff better access to patients during the operation. Such open bore magnets are often lower field magnets, typically in the 0.2 tesla range, which decreases their [[sensitivity (tests)|sensitivity]] and [[Time|temporal]] efficiency but also decreases the [[radio frequency]] [[Effective radiated power|power]] potentially absorbed by the patient during a protracted operation. Higher field magnet systems are beginning to be deployed in intraoperative imaging suites, which can combine high-field MRI with a surgical suite and even [[computed tomography|CT]] in a series of interconnected rooms. Specialty high-field interventional MR devices, such as the IMRIS system, can actually bring a high-field magnet to the patient within the operating theatre, permitting the use of standard surgical tools while the magnet is in an adjoining space.

'''John William Atkinson''' (December 31, 1923 – October 27, 2003), also known as Jack Atkinson, was an [[Americans|American]] [[psychologist]] who pioneered the scientific study of [[human]] [[motivation]], achievement and [[behavior]]. He was a [[World War II]] veteran, teacher, scholar, and long term member of the [[University of Michigan]] community.

Atkinson was a leader in establishing motivation as a distinct field of study in psychology research. His belief that scientific progress came from conceptual breakthroughs fueled his formulation and reformulation of a theory of motivation. He was one of the first in psychology to incorporate rigorous mathematical models in his theories and to use computer simulations of these models for experimentation.  He also recognized the importance of measurement in science, maintaining a career-long interest in the refinement of measures of motivation by means of [[content analysis]] of [[Imagination|imaginative thought]] using, for example, the [[Thematic Apperception Test]] which he developed jointly with his mentor [[David C. McClelland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McClelland|first=David|title=The Achievement Motive|year=1953|publisher=Appleton-Century-Crofts|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is well known for establishing measures for motives of achievement, affiliation, fear, sex, risk-taking behavior, and aggression. His discipline-changing ideas were followed around the world.  In recognition, he received in 1979 the [[American Psychological Association]]'s highest award, the Gold Medal for Distinguished Scientific Contributions.

Atkinson was born in Jersey City, NJ, to Frank G. and Wilhelmina "Minnie" Atkinson. He attended public schools in Oradell NJ, graduating from Dwight Morrow High School in Englewood NJ.  He enlisted in the U.S. Army Air Corp, earning his wings in 1944.  He served as an advanced instrument flight instructor for  the B-25 and other bombers.  On earning his wings Jack married his high-school sweetheart Mary Jane Wanta.  They were married in 1944 in Macon, GA.

After the war Atkinson completed his undergraduate psychology degree with Honors at [[Wesleyan University]], graduating in the middle of the 1946-47 academic year.  As a lecturer at Wesleyan University, he began to pursue his interests in basic research on the arousal of human needs and behavior  with the financial support of  the [[Office of Naval Research]] and collaboration with [[David McClelland]].  Atkinson was awarded his doctorate in Psychology in 1950 at the [[University of Michigan]]. He was invited to join the faculty of the University of Michigan in the Psychology Department where he remained his entire career (1950 - 1985).

Atkinson was devoted to the teaching of undergraduates throughout his career. As one of the original founders of the [http://www.lsa.umich.edu/honors/ University of Michigan's Honors Program in the College of Literature, Science and the Arts], Professor Atkinson fostered unique opportunities and created multi-disciplinary courses to challenge undergraduate students.  He authored and edited many books and articles on the scientific study  of human motivation, achievement and behavior. Many of his books have been translated into other languages, including Russian, German, and Spanish. His theoretical and experimental work spanned decades and spawned many doctorates.

Atkinson was elected a Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1979.&lt;ref name=AAAS&gt;{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780-2010: Chapter A|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterA.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|accessdate=27 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other awards and honors include a [[Guggenheim Fellowship]] (1960),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=List of Guggenheim Fellowships awarded in 1960|url=http://www.gf.org/fellows/all?index=a|publisher=The John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation|accessdate=31 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; participation twice as a Fellow at the [[Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences]] at [[Stanford University]], Fellow of the [[American Psychological Association]], an Honorary Doctorate from Ruhr University, Germany, Wesleyan University Distinguished Alumni Award, the Association for Psychological Science: William James Fellow Award,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Association for Psychological Science: William James Fellow Award - Past Recipients|url=http://www.psychologicalscience.org/awards/james/recipients.cfm|publisher=Association for Psychological Science|accessdate=31 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the American Psychological Association's highest award, the Gold Medal for Distinguished Scientific Contribution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Award Winners: Distinguished Scientific Contribution|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/amp/60/8/750.pdf|publisher=American Psychological Association|accessdate=31 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Atkinson was honored on his retirement with a special colloquium at the University which brought together a number of his former students and colleagues who spoke of his inspiration and contributions to the science of human motivation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Brown|first=Donald|title=Frontiers of motivational psychology: essays in honor of John W.

Atkinson insisted on ethical behavior and highly valued the fundamental freedoms on which the USA was founded. An expression of his support for a free press was his role as a member of the Board of Control of the Michigan Daily during the turbulent 1960s.   In the early 1970s, his beliefs led him to become outraged by the behavior of President [[Richard M. Nixon]], whom he viewed as a threat to liberty and justice.  Jack organized and led public meetings and demonstrations denouncing President Nixon and vigorously promoted Nixon's impeachment by Congress.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="134894">The following '''list of worker deaths in United States labor disputes''' captures known incidents of fatal labor-related violence in U.S. labor history, which began in the colonial era with the [[Timeline of labor issues and events|earliest worker demands]] around 1636 for better working conditions. It does not include killings of enslaved persons. According to a study in 1969, the United States has had the bloodiest and most violent labor history of any industrial nation in the world, and there have been few industries which have been immune.&lt;ref&gt;Philip Taft and Philip Ross, "American Labor Violence: Its Causes, Character, and Outcome," The History of Violence in America: A Report to the National Commission on the Causes and Prevention of Violence, ed. Hugh Davis Graham and Ted Robert Gurr, 1969.&lt;/ref&gt;

This list is not comprehensive. A number of factors (multi-sided conflicts, physically remote locations, company-controlled locations, exaggerated or biased original reporting, etc.) make some of the death and injury counts uncertain.

Thousands of federal troops and deputy marshals were inserted over the governor's protests and clashed with rioters.  The strike dissolved by August 2.

Leadville city police took the side of the mine owners, recruited new officers from Denver, and "apparently kept up a near-constant campaign of harassment and violence against union members throughout the strike." As many as six union men were killed during the strike, by strikebreakers, police, or under mysterious circumstances. Four more union men died when they joined about 50 strikers in a nighttime rifle and dynamite attack on the Coronado and Emmett mines; the attackers burned the Coronado shafthouse and killed a firefighter trying to extinguish the blaze.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=William P.|last=Philpott|title=The Lessons of Leadville, or, Why the Western Federation of Miners turned left|publisher=Colorado Historical Society|year=1995|pages=38–39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|[[Battle of Blair Mountain]]: the largest labor uprising in United States history and the largest organized armed uprising since the American Civil War. During an attempt by the miners to unionize, and following the murder of [[Sid Hatfield]], 10,000 armed coal miners confronted 3000 lawmen and [[Baldwin-Felts]] strikebreakers, who were backed by coal mine operators. In the summer of 1921 in [[Mingo County, West Virginia|Mingo County]], hundreds of miners were arrested without [[habeas corpus]] and other basic legal rights. Talk spread of a march to free those confined miners, end martial law, and organize the county. In [[Kanawha County, West Virginia|Kanawha County]], up to 13,000 miners gathered and began marching toward [[Logan County, West Virginia|Logan County]] on August 24. The reviled anti-union sheriff of Logan County, [[Don Chafin]]&lt;ref&gt;The Herald-Dispatch. [http://www.wvculture.org/History/government/chafindon01.html "Funeral Rites Thursday For Colorful Don Chafin"], August 10, 1954.&lt;/ref&gt; set up defenses on Blair Mountain, with the nation's largest private armed force of 2000. By August 29, battle was fully joined. Chafin's men, though outnumbered, had the advantage of higher positions and better weaponry. Private hired planes dropped homemade bombs on the miners near the towns of Jeffery, Sharples and Blair. Army bombers were used for aerial surveillance.  Sporadic gun battles continued for a week. Up to 30 deaths were reported by Chafin's side and 50–100 on the union miners' side, with hundreds more injured. On September 2, federal troops arrived by presidential order, and the miners started heading home the next day. About one million rounds were fired in the battle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2015-09-13|url=http://archive.archaeology.org/1201/features/blair_mountain_coal_activism_west_virginia.html|volume=65|number=1|date=January–February 2012|first=Samir S.|last=Patel|title=Mountaintop Rescue – Archaeology, coal, and activism collide in the Appalachian Mountains at the site of America's largest labor conflict|work=Archaeology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|Three members of the [[Coal and Iron Police]] beat miner [[John Barkoski]] to death.

Eyewitnesses said one of them had launched an unprovoked attack on Barkoski, who received a laceration of the left cheek, five or six head wounds, two broken ribs and a fractured nose. Later at police barracks over the course of four hours, according to trial testimony, a third officer beat Barkoski with a strap while he lay semiconscious on the floor, twisted his ears until the miner cried aloud, and twisted his broken nose until he lapsed again into unconsciousness. Then he beat Barkoski over the chest with a poker until the poker bent, straightened the implement and beat the man again. He stripped the miner to the waist in order to better use a strap and kicked Barkoski until the miner's body rolled over and over on the floor. The original attacker also beat Barkoski, kicked him, struck him over the head with knucklers, and slapped him on the arms and legs and neck with his blackjack.  The next morning he was taken to a hospital where he died. A jury acquitted the three officers of murder.&lt;ref name=ww/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|first=Frank|last= Butler|title=Coal and Iron Justice|work=The Nation|date=October 16, 1929|url=http://explorepahistory.com/odocument.php?docId=1-4-29A}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Maria Deloria Knoll''' is an expert in the fields of [[epidemiology]], disease surveillance, vaccine trial conduct, and bio-statistics. She currently serves as Associate Director of Science at the International Vaccine Access Center (IVAC), an organization dedicated to accelerating global access to life-saving vaccines, at the [[Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health]] in Baltimore, Maryland.

==Education==
Maria Deloria Knoll completed her undergraduate studies in Biostatistics at the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]]. She received her PhD in Epidemiology from the [[Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health]] in Baltimore, Maryland.

==Research==
Knoll's research interests include the epidemiology of vaccine-preventable infectious diseases and the methodologic issues pertaining to the design, conduct and analysis of epidemiologic studies and clinical trials. 
Current projects include the PERCH study to determine the causes of pneumonia in settings representative of developing countries to guide the development of new pneumonia vaccines and treatment algorithms for 2015 onwards, estimating the burden and serotype distribution of pneumococcal and meningococcal disease among children and adults, measuring the impact on disease burden of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine use in Kenya and The Gambia, and evaluating the value of antigen-based diagnostic tests in blood to improve sensitivity of pneumococcal detection in pneumonia patients.
Knoll has over 20 years of experience in the design, conduct, and analysis of clinical trials and epidemiologic studies. She spent 13 years at the National Institute of Health’s National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and her clinical trials experience there included close working relationships with many large and mid-sized vaccine manufacturers.  Knoll also served as a Research Assistant Professor at Northwestern University’s Department of Preventive Medicine in Chicago, Illinois, where she directed a course on clinical trial design, conduct and analysis in their MPH program, conducted cardiovascular and HIV-related epidemiologic studies using data from established cohorts, and designed therapeutic clinical trials for the Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago.  She has written many well cited original articles and is regularly an invited speaker to various international health conferences.

===The Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine Introduction Study (PCVIS) in The Gambia and Kenya===
The [[GAVI Alliance]] and the [[Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation]] are funding two pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) impact studies in the Gambia and Kenya. In 2006, these projects were identified as critical to GAVI's objectives of generating sustainable PCV introduction. These studies, funded through the [[PneumoADIP|Pneumococcal Vaccines Accelerated Development and Introduction Plan (PneumoADIP)]], a project of IVAC at The [[Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health|Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health (JHSPH)]], provide the earliest possible opportunity to document the health impact of routine use of PCVs in developing countries.

'''Medstar Television Inc.''' is a television production company based in [[Allentown, Pennsylvania]].

==History &amp; Founding==
Medstar was incorporated in the state of [[Pennsylvania]] in 1981 by Paul Dowling and William Ferretti to produce medical news and health information. &lt;ref&gt;http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1985-02-12/features/8501090015_1_medstar-humana-hospital-health-matters&lt;/ref&gt; From the start, Medstar financed, produced and distributed all of its own productions. ([http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1985-02-12/features/8501090015_1_medstar-humana-hospital-health-matters Health Matters: Independents Prescription Works])

==Productions==
One of its first was ''Health Matters'', a program on health and lifestyle issues, produced in cooperation with hospitals throughout the United States, which sponsor the program in their local areas with local and national content, along the same lines as ''[[PM Magazine]]''. ''Health Matters'' was [[television syndication|syndicated]] to various commercial and [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] stations during the 1980s.  &lt;ref&gt;http://articles.mcall.com/1987-01-18/business/2567668_1_medstar-communications-health-matters-television&lt;/ref&gt;

Medstar later expanded to produce two medical news products, "MedstarSource" and "MedstarAdvances" syndicated to commercial television stations in the United States.  Production of these segments ended in August 2011.

In 1990 Medstar began to produce programming for cable television including the [[Discovery Channel]], [[HBO]] and [[TLC (TV channel)|TLC]].

In 1995 the company created the ''Medical Detectives'' series on [[forensic science]], which premiered on TLC in April 1995. ([https://www.imdb.com/company/co0006447/ IMDB program listing])  It was the first reality based forensic series on television and used a 'murder mystery' approach to documentary storytelling. In 2000 the Medical Detectives series moved to the CourtTV network (now [[TruTV]]) where it was re-titled ''[[Forensic Files]]'' and quickly became the networks highest rated television series.  Internationally, the series was sold to stations and networks in over 142 countries where it remains enormously popular.  Peter Thomas narrates the series which is still in production, with more than 400 episodes. In 2002, ''Forensic Files'' would appear on [[NBC]] as the first prime time television series originally produced for cable to air on a commercial network, as a summer replacement series.

[[File:Margaritaria discoidea medicine bark.JPG|thumb|right|Stem of ''[[Margaritaria discoidea]]'' at [[Ilanda Wilds]], South Africa, showing old scar from bark removal for muti use]]
'''Muti''' is a term for [[traditional medicine]] in [[Southern Africa]] as far north as [[Lake Tanganyika]]. In [[South African English]], the word "muti" is derived from the [[Zulu language|Zulu]] word ''umuthi'', meaning "tree," whose root is ''-thi''. In [[Southern Africa]], "muti" and [[cognates]] of ''umuthi'' are in widespread use in most indigenous African languages as well as in South African English and [[Afrikaans]], which sometimes use "muti" as a slang word for medicine in general.&lt;ref name=Africa&gt;{{cite web|title=Traditional African Healing|url=http://www.africanholocaust.net/news_ah/traditionalhealing.html|publisher=African Code|accessdate=18 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Traditional medicine==
African [[traditional medicine]] makes use of various natural products, many derived from trees and other plants. Botanical medicine prescribed by an [[inyanga]] or herbal healer is generally known as "muthi", but the term can apply to other traditional medical formulations, including those that are zoological or mineral in composition.

Vulture brains are used for prophecy in muthi.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Vultures Are Revolting: Here’s Why We Need to Save Them |author=Elizabeth Royte |work=National Geographic |date=January 2016 |access-date= 25 November 2018 |url= https://www.nationalgeographic.com/magazine/2016/01/vultures-endangered-scavengers/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Linguistics==
This noun is of the '' umu''/''imi'' class so the singular (tree) is ''umuthi'' and the plural (trees) is ''imithi''. Since the pronunciation of the initial vowel of this class is unstressed, the singular is sometimes pronounced ''muthi''. The word is rendered as ''muti'' by the historical effects of the British [[colonialism|colonial]] spelling.

==Colloquial use==
In colloquial English and Afrikaans  the word "muti" is often used to refer to medicines in general or medicines that have a 'miraculous' effect, e.g.

* "Die dokter het 'muti' op die seerplek gesmeer en die volgende dag was dit heeltemal gesond." (The doctor rubbed 'muti' on the wound and the next day it was completely healed.)
* "My dokter het vir my 'muti' verskaf vir my seer keel." ("My doctor gave me some 'muti' for my sore throat.")

==Use of Isicakathi  in the Eastern Cape==
[[Image:Street "Muti" vendor.jpg|thumb|Street ''muti'' vendor in South Africa]]
''Isicakathi'' is a term that is used by [[Xhosa people]] when referring to plants with major pharmacological

===Isicakathi for pre-natal and post-natal care===
[[Agapanthus praecox]] is  one of the plants that falls under ''isicakathi''  used during pregnancy. It is  taken orally from the six month of pregnancy until delivery.

== Muti killings ==
{{further|Murder for body parts}}
Occasions of murder and mutilation associated with some traditional cultural practices in South Africa are also termed ''muti killings''. More correctly known as ''medicine murder'', these are not [[human sacrifice]] in a religious sense, but rather involve the murder of someone in order to excise body parts for incorporation as ingredients into medicine and concoctions used in [[witchcraft]].

In February 2010, Deputy Provincial Commissioner William Mpembe of the South African Police Service (SAPS) in North West Province said that “muti murders, particularly those involving young children, seem to be on the rise in the Tshwane areas including Soshanguve, Garankuwa and Rietgat"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sowetanlive.co.za/news/2011/02/25/cash-for-organs-is-no-joke |title=Cash for organs is no joke |date=25 February 2011 |work=sowetanlive.co.za |publisher=Sowetan Live and SAPA |accessdate=3 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same month, African traditional healers and the Gauteng government convened at a seminar in Pretoria, South Africa to root out the "evil practice of mutilating human bodies for purposes of muti making."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/Muti-killings-to-be-tackled-20100219 |title=Muti killings to be tackled |author=SAPA |date=19 February 2010 |work=news24.com |publisher=News24 |accessdate=3 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1744">'''National Bourbon Heritage Month''' is an observance in the [[United States]] that calls for celebration of [[bourbon whiskey|bourbon]] as America's "Native Spirit". On August 2, 2007, the [[United States Senate|US Senate]] declared September 2007 as "National Bourbon Heritage Month." &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/110/sres294/text# Text of A resolution designating September 2007 as “National Bourbon Heritage Month”.]&lt;/ref&gt; The bill, sponsored by Republican Senator [[Jim Bunning]] of [[Kentucky]], passed by unanimous consent. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=sr110-294#votes Senate Resolution 294 (S. Res. 294)]&lt;/ref&gt; The resolution calls for consumers who enjoy bourbon to do so responsibly and in moderation.  The bill reinforces the 1964 Act of Congress that declared bourbon "America's Native Spirit" by celebrating the family heritage, tradition and deep-rooted legacy that the bourbon industry contributes to the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://liquor.com/celebrate/national-bourbon-heritage-month/ National Bourbon Heritage Month]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Celebration==

To celebrate America's Native Spirit and National Bourbon Heritage Month, the city of [[Bardstown, Kentucky]] has hosted the [[Kentucky Bourbon Festival]] every September since 1991. The festival is dedicated to celebrating the history and art of distilling [[Bourbon whiskey]].

The '''National Mental Health Development Unit''' ('''NMHDU''') was a governmental organisation in [[England]] charged with supporting the implementation of [[mental health]] policy. The unit worked to achieve this by advising on best practice for improving mental health and mental health services. NMHDU closed on 31 March 2011.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mhfe.org.uk/content/national-mental-health-development-unit-nmhdu-website MHFE archive of the NMHDU website&lt;/ref&gt;

The NMHDU was funded by the [[Department of Health (United Kingdom)|Department of Health]] and the [[National Health Service (England)|National Health Service]], and aimed to work in partnership with the NHS's [[Strategic Health Authorities]] and all stakeholders. The Unit was launched in 2009, following the abolition of the [[National Institute for Mental Health in England]] (NIMHE). The director of the NIMHE, Ian MacPherson, became the director of the NMHDU.

The Unit had several specific programmes of activity, including to support the [[Improving Access to Psychological Therapies]] (IAPT) scheme. The Unit also supported the government's strategy for mental health, [[New Horizons (England)|New Horizons]], which was published in December 2009 following the end of the [[National Service Framework]] plans.

'''Omphalitis of newborn''' is the medical term for inflammation of the [[umbilical cord]] stump in the [[neonate|neonatal]] newborn period, most commonly attributed to a bacterial infection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.medicine.nevada.edu/Residency/lasvegas/Pediatrics/documents/Omphalitis.pdf | title=Brief Review of Omphalitis | publisher=UNSOM Department of Pediatrics | accessdate=23 July 2013 | author=Jones, Kevin, MD, Neayland, Beverly, MD.|others=dead link}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typically immediately after an infant is born, the umbilical cord is cut with a small remnant (often referred to as the stump) left behind. Normally the stump separates from the skin within 3–45 days after birth.&lt;ref name="WO-book"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cunningham|first1=F|title=Williams Obstetrics:The Newborn|publisher=McGraw-Hill|edition=24|accessdate=19 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A small amount of pus-like material is commonly seen at the base of the stump and can be controlled by keeping the stump open to air to dry.&lt;ref name="rosenburg"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rosenberg|title=Current Diagnosis &amp; Treatment: Pediatrics|edition=22e|accessdate=2 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Certain bacteria  can grow and infect the stump during this process and as a result significant redness and swelling may develop, and in some cases the infection can then spread through the [[umbilical vessels (disambiguation)|umbilical vessels]] to the rest of the body.&lt;ref name="rosenburg" /&gt; While currently an uncommon anatomical location for [[infection]] in the newborn in the [[United States]], it has caused significant morbidity and mortality both historically and in areas where [[health care]] is less readily available. In general, when this type of infection is suspected or diagnosed, antibiotic treatment is given, and in cases of serious complications surgical management may be appropriate.&lt;ref name="rosenburg" /&gt;

==Signs and symptoms==

Clinically, [[neonate]]s with omphalitis present within the first two weeks of life with signs and symptoms of a skin infection ([[cellulitis]]) around the umbilical stump (redness, warmth, swelling, pain), [[pus]] from the umbilical stump, [[fever]], fast heart rate ([[tachycardia]]), low blood pressure ([[hypotension]]), [[somnolence]], poor feeding, and yellow skin ([[jaundice]]). Omphalitis can quickly progress to [[sepsis]] and presents a potentially life-threatening infection. In fact, even in cases of omphalitis without evidence of more serious infection such as [[necrotizing fasciitis]], mortality is high (in the 10% range).

==Causes==
Omphalitis is most commonly caused by bacteria. The culprits usually are ''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]'', ''[[Streptococcus]]'', and ''[[Escherichia coli]]''.&lt;ref name="WO-book" /&gt; The infection is typically caused by a combination of these organisms and is a mixed [[Gram-positive]] and [[Gram-negative]] infection. [[Anaerobic organism|Anaerobic]] bacteria can also be involved.&lt;ref&gt;Fleisher, Gary R. Textbook of Pediatric Emergency Medicine. Philadelphia: Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins, 2006, p. 928.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diagnosis==
In a normal umbilical stump, you first see the umbilicus lose its characteristic bluish-white, moist appearance and become dry and black&lt;ref name="WO-book" /&gt;  After several days to weeks, the stump should fall off and leave a pink fleshy wound which continues to heal as it becomes a normal umbilicus.&lt;ref name="WO-book" /&gt;

For an infected umbilical stump, diagnosis is usually made by the clinical appearance of the umbilical cord stump and the findings on history and [[physical examination]]. There may be some confusion, however, if a well-appearing neonate simply has some redness around the umbilical stump. In fact, a mild degree is common, as is some bleeding at the stump site with detachment of the umbilical cord. The picture may be clouded even further if [[Corrosive substance|caustic]] agents have been used to clean the stump or if [[silver nitrate]] has been used to [[cauterization|cauterize]] [[granuloma]]ta of the umbilical stump.

==Prevention==
During the 1950s there were outbreaks of omphalitis that then led to anti-bacterial treatment of the umbilical cord stump as the new standard of care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Janssen|first1=PA|last2=Selwood|first2=BL|last3=Dobson|first3=SR|last4=Peacock|first4=D|last5=Thiessen|first5=PN|title=To dye or not to dye: a randomized, clinical trial of a triple dye/alcohol regime versus dry cord care.|journal=Pediatrics|date=January 2003|volume=111|issue=1|pages=15–20|pmid=12509548}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was later determined that in developed countries keeping the cord dry is sufficient, (known as "dry cord care") as recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics.&lt;ref name="WO-book" /&gt; The umbilical cord dries more quickly and separates more readily when exposed to air&lt;ref name="WO-book" /&gt;  However, each [[hospital]]/[[birthing center]] has its own recommendations for care of the [[umbilical cord]] after delivery. Some recommend not using any medicinal washes on the cord. Other popular recommendations include triple dye, [[betadine]], [[bacitracin]], or [[silver sulfadiazine]]. With regards to the medicinal treatments, there is little data to support any one treatment (or lack thereof) over another. However one recent review of many studies supported the use of chlorhexidine treatment as a way to reduce risk of death by 23% and risk of omphalitis by anywhere between 27-56% in community settings in underdeveloped countries.&lt;ref name="CochranePrevention"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Imdad|first1=A|last2=Bautista|first2=RM|last3=Senen|first3=KA|last4=Uy|first4=ME|last5=Mantaring JB|first5=3rd|last6=Bhutta|first6=ZA|title=Umbilical cord antiseptics for preventing sepsis and death among newborns.|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=31 May 2013|volume=5|pages=CD008635|pmid=23728678|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD008635.pub2}}&lt;/ref&gt; This study also found that this treatment increased the time that it would take for the umbilical stump to separate or fall off by 1.7 days.&lt;ref name="CochranePrevention" /&gt; Lastly this large review also supported the notion that in hospital settings no medicinal type of cord care treatment was better at reducing infections compared to dry cord care.&lt;ref name="CochranePrevention" /&gt;

==Treatment==
Treatment consists of [[antibiotic]] therapy aimed at the typical bacterial [[pathogen]]s in addition to supportive care for any complications which might result from the infection itself such as [[hypotension]] or [[respiratory failure]]. A typical regimen will include [[intravenous]] [[antibiotics]] such as from the [[penicillin|penicillin-group]] which is active against ''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]'' and an [[aminoglycoside]] for activity against Gram-negative bacteria. For particularly invasive infections, antibiotics to cover anaerobic bacteria may be added (such as [[metronidazole]]). Treatment is typically for two weeks and often necessitates insertion of a [[central venous catheter]] or [[peripherally inserted central catheter]].

==Epidemiology==
The current incidence in the United States is somewhere around 0.5% per year; overall, the incidence rate for developed world falls between 0.2–0.7%. In developing countries, the incidence of omphalitis varies from 2 to 7 for 100 live births.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.global-help.org/publications/books/help_pedsurgeryafrica20.pdf | title=Omphalitis | work=Paediatric Surgery: A Comprehensive Text For Africa. | accessdate=23 July 2013 | author=Bugaje, Mairo Adamu|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; There does not appear to be any racial or ethnic predilection.

Like many [[bacteria]]l [[infection]]s, omphalitis is more common in those patients who have a weakened or deficient [[immune system]] or who are hospitalized and subject to invasive procedures. Therefore, infants who are [[Preterm birth|premature]], sick with other infections such as blood infection ([[sepsis]]) or [[pneumonia]], or who have [[immunodeficiency|immune deficiencies]] are at greater risk. Infants with normal immune systems are at risk if they have had a prolonged [[birth]], birth complicated by infection of the placenta ([[chorioamnionitis]]), or have had umbilical [[catheter]]s.

== Overview ==
[[File:Stephane Gigandet Open food facts KidEXPERIMENT @ Open World Forum Paris.JPG|thumbnail|left|Stéphane Gigandet presenting the project on October 2012 at the [[Open World Forum]].]]

The project gathers information and data on food products from around the world.&lt;ref name=whoweare /&gt;

For each item, the database stores its generic name, quantity, type of packaging, brand, category, manufacturing or processing locations, countries and stores where the product is sold, list of ingredients, any traces (for [[Food allergy|allergies]], [[dietary laws]] or any specific diet), [[food additive]]s and nutritional information.

Each contributor can add or edit food items based on the information explicitly shown on the package.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ile-reunion.pressecologie.com/actualite/Mieux-conna%C3%AEtre-ce-que-nous-mangeons#.UbVvQed7Lng |title=Mieux connaître ce que nous mangeons |date=3 July 2012 |website=ile-reunion.pressecologie.com |access-date=11 June 2013 |quote=Les étiquettes et autres emballages de nos aliments fourmillent d’informations : nature des produits, quantité, origine, ingrédients, à cela s’ajoutent les allergènes, les tableaux affichant la composition nutritionnelle, sans oublier les labels en tous genres, ou encore l’empreinte carbone.}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the [[barcode]] (when available) is generally used as the [[identifier]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lelabo-ess.org/?Dans-l-ESS-l-ouverture-des-donnees |title=Dans l’ESS, l’ouverture des données a bien commencé : focus sur trois projets passionnants |date=8 April 2013 |website=lelabo-ess.org |access-date=11 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mobile phone applications allow for capturing photos and information that are reprocessed manually by volunteers.

Due to similar mechanisms for modification, extension, or deletion of content and structure, the project is sometimes compared to [[Wikipedia]] in the media.&lt;ref name=c&gt;{{cite journal |last=Parfait |first=Audrey |date=2 May 2012 |title=Open Food Facts, nouveau site d'informations alimentaires |url=http://www.lexpress.fr/styles/saveurs/open-food-facts-nouveau-site-d-informations-alimentaires_1117288.html |journal=[[L'Express]] |access-date=11 June 2013 |quote=Sur le modèle de l'encyclopédie en ligne Wikipedia, Open Food Facts est fondé sur la collaboration des utilisateurs.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.savoirscom1.info/2013/04/26/1362/ |title=Open Food Facts, le wikipédia des aliments |website=savoirscom1.info |date=26 April 2013 |access-date=11 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Reuses ===
The data is reused by various projects on issues related to palm oil, sugar, and location of the producers.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.data.gouv.fr/en/datasets/produits-alimentaires-ingredients-nutrition-labels/ List of reuses Data.gouv.fr]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Definition and symptoms --&gt;
'''Pancreatitis''' is a condition characterized by [[inflammation]] of the [[pancreas]].&lt;ref name=NID2012/&gt; The pancreas is a large organ behind the [[stomach]] that produces [[digestive enzyme]]s and a number of [[hormone]]s.&lt;ref name=NID2012/&gt; There are two main types, [[acute pancreatitis]] and [[chronic pancreatitis]].&lt;ref name=NID2012/&gt; Signs and symptoms of pancreatitis include [[epigastrium|pain in the upper abdomen]], [[nausea]] and [[vomiting]].&lt;ref name=NID2012/&gt; The pain often goes into the back and is usually severe.&lt;ref name=NID2012/&gt; In acute pancreatitis a [[fever]] may occur and symptoms typically resolve in a few days.&lt;ref name=NID2012/&gt; In chronic pancreatitis weight loss, [[steatorrhea|fatty stool]], and [[diarrhea]] may occur.&lt;ref name=NID2012/&gt; Complications may include infection, bleeding, [[diabetes mellitus]], or problems with other organs.&lt;ref name=NID2012&gt;{{cite web|title=Pancreatitis|url=http://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/health-topics/digestive-diseases/pancreatitis/Pages/facts.aspx|website=niddk.nih.gov|accessdate=1 March 2015|date=August 16, 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150307095945/http://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/health-topics/digestive-diseases/pancreatitis/Pages/facts.aspx|archivedate=7 March 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Causes and diagnosis --&gt;
The two most common causes of acute pancreatitis are a [[gall stone]] blocking the [[common bile duct]] after the [[pancreatic duct]] has joined; and heavy [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]] use.&lt;ref name=NID2012/&gt; Other causes include direct trauma, certain medications, infections such as [[mumps]], and [[tumor]]s.&lt;ref name=NID2012/&gt; Chronic pancreatitis may develop as a result of acute pancreatitis.&lt;ref name=NID2012/&gt; It is most commonly due to many years of heavy alcohol use.&lt;ref name=NID2012/&gt; Other causes include [[hyperlipidemia|high levels of blood fats]], [[hypercalcemia|high blood calcium]], some medications, and certain [[genetic disorder]]s such as [[cystic fibrosis]] among others.&lt;ref name=NID2012/&gt; [[tobacco smoking|Smoking]] increases the risk of both acute and chronic pancreatitis.&lt;ref name=Lancet2015/&gt;&lt;ref name=Yad2013&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Yadav|first1=D|last2=Lowenfels|first2=AB|title=The epidemiology of pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer.|journal=Gastroenterology|date=June 2013|volume=144|issue=6|pages=1252–61|pmid=23622135|doi=10.1053/j.gastro.2013.01.068|pmc=3662544}}&lt;/ref&gt; Diagnosis of acute pancreatitis is based on a threefold increase in the blood of either [[amylase]] or [[lipase]].&lt;ref name=NID2012/&gt; In chronic pancreatitis these tests may be normal.&lt;ref name=NID2012/&gt; [[Medical imaging]] such as [[ultrasound]] and [[CT scan]] may also be useful.&lt;ref name=NID2012/&gt;

&lt;!-- Prevention and treatment --&gt;
Acute pancreatitis is usually treated with [[intravenous fluid]]s, [[pain medication]], and sometimes [[antibiotic]]s.&lt;ref name=NID2012/&gt; Typically eating and drinking are disallowed, and a [[nasogastric tube]] is placed in the stomach.&lt;ref name=NID2012/&gt; A procedure known as an [[endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography]] (ERCP) may be done to examine the distal common bile duct and remove a gallstone if present.&lt;ref name=NID2012/&gt; In those with gallstones the [[gallbladder]] is often also removed.&lt;ref name=NID2012/&gt; In chronic pancreatitis, in addition to the above, temporary feeding through a nasogastric tube may be used to provide adequate [[nutrition]].&lt;ref name=NID2012/&gt; Long-term dietary changes and [[pancreatic enzyme replacement]] may be required.&lt;ref name=NID2012/&gt; And occasionally surgery is done to remove parts of the pancreas.&lt;ref name=NID2012/&gt;

&lt;!-- Epidemiology and history --&gt;
Globally, in 2015 about 8.9 million cases of pancreatitis occurred.&lt;ref name=GBD2015Pre/&gt; This resulted in 132,700 deaths, up from 83,000 deaths in 1990.&lt;ref name=GBD2015De/&gt;&lt;ref name=GDB2013&gt;{{cite journal|last1=GBD 2013 Mortality and Causes of Death|first1=Collaborators|title=Global, regional, and national age-sex specific all-cause and cause-specific mortality for 240 causes of death, 1990–2013: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2013|journal=Lancet|date=17 December 2014|pmid=25530442|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(14)61682-2|volume=385|issue=9963|pages=117–71|pmc=4340604}}&lt;/ref&gt; Acute pancreatitis occurs in about 30 per 100,000 people a year.&lt;ref name=Lancet2015&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lankisch|first1=PG|last2=Apte|first2=M|last3=Banks|first3=PA|title=Acute pancreatitis|journal=Lancet|date=20 January 2015|pmid=25616312|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(14)60649-8|volume=386|issue=9988|pages=85–96}}&lt;/ref&gt; New cases of chronic pancreatitis develop in about 8 per 100,000 people a year and currently affect about 50 per 100,000 people in the United States.&lt;ref name=Mun204/&gt; It is more common in men than women.&lt;ref name=NID2012/&gt; Often chronic pancreatitis starts between the ages of 30 and 40 while it is rare in children.&lt;ref name=NID2012/&gt; Acute pancreatitis was first described on autopsy in 1882 while chronic pancreatitis was first described in 1946.&lt;ref name=Mun204&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Muniraj|first1=T|last2=Aslanian|first2=HR|last3=Farrell|first3=J|last4=Jamidar|first4=PA|title=Chronic pancreatitis, a comprehensive review and update.

==Signs and symptoms==
The most common symptoms of pancreatitis are severe [[epigastrium|upper abdominal]] or [[left upper quadrant]] burning pain [[referred pain|radiating]] to the back, [[nausea]], and [[vomiting]] that is worse with eating. The physical examination will vary depending on severity and presence of [[internal bleeding]]. [[Blood pressure]] may be elevated by pain or decreased by [[dehydration]] or bleeding. [[Heart rate|Heart]] and [[respiratory rate]]s are often elevated. The abdomen is usually [[tenderness (medicine)|tender]] but to a lesser degree than the pain itself. As is common in abdominal disease, [[bowel sounds]] may be reduced from reflex [[ileus|bowel paralysis]]. [[Fever]] or [[jaundice]] may be present. [[Chronic pancreatitis]] can lead to [[diabetes]] or [[pancreatic cancer]]. Unexplained weight loss may occur from a lack of [[pancreatic enzyme]]s hindering [[digestion]].

===Complications===
Early complications include [[Shock (circulatory)|shock]], infection, [[systemic inflammatory response syndrome]], low blood calcium, high blood glucose, and [[dehydration]]. Blood loss, dehydration, and [[third spacing|fluid leaking]] into the [[abdominal cavity]] ([[ascites]]) can lead to [[kidney failure]]. Respiratory complications are often [[acute respiratory distress syndrome|severe]]. [[Pleural effusion]] is usually present. Shallow breathing from pain can lead to [[atelectasis|lung collapse]]. Pancreatic enzymes may attack the lungs, causing [[pneumonitis|inflammation]]. Severe inflammation can lead to intra-abdominal hypertension and [[abdominal compartment syndrome]], further impairing renal and respiratory function and potentially requiring management with an open abdomen to relieve the pressure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fitzgerald JE, Gupta S, Masterson S, Sigurdsson HH | title = Laparostomy management using the ABThera™ open abdomen negative pressure therapy system in a grade IV open abdomen secondary to acute pancreatitis | journal = Int Wound J | volume = 10 | issue = 2 | pages = 138–44 | date = April 2012 | pmid = 22487377 | doi = 10.1111/j.1742-481X.2012.00953.x | url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1742-481X.2012.00953.x/abstract | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130615065033/http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1742-481X.2012.00953.x/abstract | archivedate = 2013-06-15 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Late complications include recurrent pancreatitis and the development of [[pancreatic pseudocyst]]s—collections of pancreatic secretions that have been walled off by scar tissue. These may cause pain, become infected, rupture and bleed, block the bile duct and cause [[jaundice]], or migrate around the abdomen. Acute necrotizing pancreatitis can lead to a [[pancreatic abscess]], a collection of [[pus]] caused by [[necrosis]], [[liquefaction]], and [[infection]]. This happens in approximately 3% of cases, or almost 60% of cases involving more than two pseudocysts and gas in the pancreas.&lt;ref name="A"&gt;{{EMedicine|article|181264|Pancreatic abscess}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes==
Eighty percent of cases of pancreatitis are caused by alcohol or [[gallstone]]s. Gallstones are the single most common cause of acute pancreatitis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=NIDDK |title=Pancreatitis |date=July 2008 |work=National Digestive Diseases Information Clearinghouse |publisher=U.S. National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases |url=http://digestive.niddk.nih.gov/ddiseases/pubs/pancreatitis/ |id=08–1596 |ref=harv |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070107120906/http://digestive.niddk.nih.gov/ddiseases/pubs/pancreatitis/ |archivedate=2007-01-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alcohol (drug)|Alcohol]] is the single most common cause of chronic pancreatitis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.umm.edu/altmed/articles/pancreatitis-000122.htm |title=Pancreatitis |publisher=A.D.A.M., Inc. |date= |accessdate=2013-01-05 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121230085927/http://www.umm.edu/altmed/articles/pancreatitis-000122.htm |archivedate=2012-12-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Apte MV, Pirola RC, Wilson JS | title = Pancreas: alcoholic pancreatitis—it's the alcohol, stupid | journal = Nature Reviews Gastroenterology &amp; Hepatology | volume = 6 | issue = 6 | pages = 321–22 | date = June 2009 | pmid = 19494819 | doi = 10.1038/nrgastro.2009.84 | laysummary = http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/706319 |laysource=Medscape Today }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Yadav D, Hawes RH, Brand RE, Anderson MA, Money ME, Banks PA, Bishop MD, Baillie J, Sherman S, DiSario J, Burton FR, Gardner TB, Amann ST, Gelrud A, Lawrence C, Elinoff B, Greer JB, O'Connell M, Barmada MM, Slivka A, Whitcomb DC | title = Alcohol consumption, cigarette smoking, and the risk of recurrent acute and chronic pancreatitis | journal = Arch.

===Medications===
There are seven classes of medications associated with acute pancreatitis: [[statins]], [[ACE inhibitors]], [[oral contraceptive]]s/[[hormone replacement therapy]] (HRT), [[diuretics]], antiretroviral therapy, [[valproic acid]], and [[oral hypoglycemic agents]]. Mechanisms of these drugs causing pancreatitis are not known exactly; but it is possible that statins have direct toxic effect on the pancreas or through the long-term accumulation of toxic metabolites. Meanwhile, ACE inhibitors cause [[angioedema]] of the pancreas through the accumulation of [[bradykinin]]. Oral contraceptives/HRT cause [[arterial thrombosis]] of the pancreas through the accumulation of fat ([[hypertriglyceridemia]]). Diuretics such as furosemide have a direct toxic effect on the pancreas. Meanwhile, thiazide diuretics cause hypertriglyceridemia and [[hypercalcemia]], where the latter is the risk factor for pancreatic stones.

HIV infection itself can cause a person to be more likely to get pancreatitis. Meanwhile, antiretroviral drugs may cause metabolic disturbances such as [[hyperglycemia]] and [[hypercholesterolemia]], which predisposes to pancreatitis. Valproic acid may have direct toxic effect on the pancreas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kaurich|first1=Tracie|title=Drug-induced acute pancreatitis|journal=Proceedings (Baylor University. Medical Center)|date=January 2008|volume=21|issue=1|pages=77–81|pmc=2190558|doi=10.1080/08998280.2008.11928366|pmid=18209761}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are various oral hypoglycemic agents that contributes to pancreatitis including [[metformin]].

Other common causes include [[trauma (medicine)|trauma]], [[autoimmune pancreatitis|autoimmune disease]], [[Hypercalcemia|high blood calcium]], [[hypothermia]], and [[endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography]] (ERCP). [[Pancreas divisum]] is a common [[congenital malformation]] of the pancreas that may underlie some recurrent cases. [[Diabetes mellitus type&amp;nbsp;2]] is associated with a 2.8-fold higher risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Noel RA, Braun DK, Patterson RE, Bloomgren GL | title = Increased risk of acute pancreatitis and biliary disease observed in patients with type 2 diabetes: a retrospective cohort study | journal = Diabetes Care | volume = 32 | issue = 5 | pages = 834–38 | date = May 2009 | pmid = 19208917 | pmc = 2671118 | doi = 10.2337/dc08-1755 | url = http://care.diabetesjournals.org/content/32/5/834.full | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120610163642/http://care.diabetesjournals.org/content/32/5/834.full | archivedate = 2012-06-10 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Less common causes include [[pancreatic cancer]], pancreatic duct stones,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Macaluso JN |title=Editorial Comment |journal=J. Urol. |volume=158 |issue=2 |page=522 |date=August 1997 | doi = 10.1016/S0022-5347(01)64525-7|url=http://www.jurology.com/article/S0022-5347%2801%2964525-7/fulltext}} on {{cite journal |vauthors=Matthews K, Correa RJ, Gibbons RP, Weissman RM, Kozarek RA | title = Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy for obstructing pancreatic duct calculi | journal = J.

There is an [[hereditary pancreatitis|inherited form]] that results in the activation of [[trypsinogen]] within the pancreas, leading to [[autodigestion]]. Involved genes may include [[trypsin 1]], which codes for trypsinogen, [[SPINK1]], which codes for a [[trypsin inhibitor]], or [[cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author=D.

==Diagnosis==
[[File:Pankreatitis exsudativ CT axial.jpg|thumb|Acute exudative pancreatitis on CT scan]] [[File:CalcifiedPanDucStoneandSomefluid.png|thumb|Calcified pancreatic duct stones with some free intra-abdominal fluid]]
The differential diagnosis for pancreatitis includes but is not limited to [[cholecystitis]], [[choledocholithiasis]], [[Peptic ulcer#Complications|perforated peptic ulcer]], [[bowel infarction]], small bowel obstruction, hepatitis and mesenteric ischemia.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of acute pancreatitis|url = http://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-acute-pancreatitis|website = www.uptodate.com|accessdate = 2015-12-08|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151208191308/http://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-acute-pancreatitis|archivedate = 2015-12-08|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Diagnostic criteria|Diagnosis]] requires 2 of the 3 following criteria:
* Characteristic acute onset of [[Epigastrium|epigastric]] or vague abdominal pain that may [[Referred pain|radiate]] to the back (see signs and symptoms above)
* Serum [[amylase]] or [[lipase]] levels ≥ 3 times the upper limit of normal
* An imaging study with characteristic changes. [[CT scan|CT]], [[Magnetic resonance imaging|MRI]], abdominal ultrasound or endoscopic ultrasound can be used for diagnosis.

Amylase and lipase are 2 enzymes produced by the pancreas. Elevations in lipase are generally considered a better indicator for pancreatitis as it has greater [[Sensitivity and specificity|specificity]] and has a longer half life.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt; However, both enzymes can be elevated in other disease states. In chronic pancreatitis, the fecal [[pancreatic elastase]]-1 (FPE-1) test is a marker of exocrine pancreatic function. Additional tests that may be useful in evaluating chronic pancreatitis include [[hemoglobin A1C]], [[IgG4-related disease|immunoglobulin G4]], [[rheumatoid factor]], and [[anti-nuclear antibody]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | editor=Norton J. Greenberger | author1=Bechien Wu | author2=Darwin Conwell | author3=Peter Banks | chapter=Chronic Pancreatitis | title=Gastroenterology, Hepatology, &amp; Endoscopy | series=[[Current Medical Diagnosis and Treatment]] | page=301}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For imaging, abdominal ultrasound is convenient, simple, non-invasive, and inexpensive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author1=Lawrence W. Tierney |author2=Stephen J. McPhee | title = Medicine | publisher = McGraw-Hill |isbn =0071444416 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is more sensitive and specific for pancreatitis from gallstones than other imaging modalities.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Hospitalist Handbook|edition = 4th|publisher = Department of Medicine University of California, San Francisco|year = 2012|isbn = |location = |pages = 224–25}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 25–35% of patients the view of the pancreas can be obstructed by bowel gas making it difficult to evaluate.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

A contrast-enhanced CT scan is usually performed more than 48 hours after the onset of pain to evaluate for pancreatic necrosis and extrapancreatic fluid as well as predict the severity of the disease. CT scanning earlier can be falsely reassuring.

[[Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography|ERCP]] or an endoscopic ultrasound can also be used if a biliary cause for pancreatitis is suspected.

==Treatment==
The treatment of pancreatitis is supportive and depends on severity. [[Morphine]] generally is suitable for pain control. There are no clinical studies to suggest that morphine can aggravate or cause pancreatitis or cholecystitis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Helm JF, Venu RP, Geenen JE, Hogan WJ, Dodds WJ, Toouli J, Arndorfer RC | title = Effects of morphine on the human sphincter of Oddi | journal = Gut | volume = 29 | issue = 10 | pages = 1402–07 | date = October 1988 | pmid = 3197985 | pmc = 1434014 | doi = 10.1136/gut.29.10.1402 | url = http://gut.bmj.com/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=3197985 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

The treatment for acute pancreatitis will depend on whether the diagnosis is for the mild form of the condition, which causes no complications, or the severe form, which can cause serious complications.

===Mild acute pancreatitis===
The treatment of mild [[acute pancreatitis]] is successfully carried out by admission to a general hospital ward. Traditionally, people were not allowed to eat until the inflammation resolved but more recent evidence suggests early feeding is safe and improves outcomes. Because pancreatitis can cause lung damage and affect normal lung function, oxygen is occasionally delivered through breathing tubes that are connected via the nose. The tubes can then be removed after a few days once it is clear that the condition is improving. Dehydration may result during an episode of acute pancreatitis, so fluids will be provided intravenously. Opioids may be used for the pain. Early feeding does not appear to cause problems and may result in an ability to leave hospital sooner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vaughn|first1=VM|last2=Shuster|first2=D|last3=Rogers|first3=MAM|last4=Mann|first4=J|last5=Conte|first5=ML|last6=Saint|first6=S|last7=Chopra|first7=V|title=Early Versus Delayed Feeding in Patients With Acute Pancreatitis: A Systematic Review.|journal=Annals of Internal Medicine|date=20 June 2017|volume=166|issue=12|pages=883–92|doi=10.7326/M16-2533|pmid=28505667}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Severe acute pancreatitis===
Severe pancreatitis can cause organ failure, necrosis, infected necrosis, pseudocyst, and abscess. If diagnosed with severe acute pancreatitis, people will need to be admitted to a high dependency unit or [[intensive care unit]]. It is likely that the levels of fluids inside the body will have dropped significantly as it diverts bodily fluids and nutrients in an attempt to repair the pancreas. The drop in fluid levels can lead to a reduction in the volume of blood within the body, which is known as [[hypovolemic]] shock. Hypovolemic shock can be life-threatening as it can very quickly starve the body of the oxygen-rich blood that it needs to survive. To avoid going into hypovolemic shock, fluids will be pumped intravenously. Oxygen will be supplied through tubes attached to the nose and ventilation equipment may be used to assist with breathing. Feeding tubes may be used to provide nutrients, combined with appropriate analgesia.

As with mild acute pancreatitis, it will be necessary to treat the underlying cause—gallstones, discontinuing medications, cessation of alcohol, etc. If the cause is gallstones, it is likely that an [[Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography|ERCP]] procedure or removal of the gallbladder will be recommended. The gallbladder should be removed during the same hospital admission or within two weeks of pancreatitis onset so as to limit the risk of recurrent pancreatitis.

If the cause of pancreatitis is alcohol, cessation of alcohol consumption and treatment for alcohol dependency may improve pancreatitis. Even if the underlying cause is not related to alcohol consumption, doctors recommend avoiding it for at least six months as this can cause further damage to the pancreas during the recovery process.&lt;ref&gt;E Medicine Health, Jerry R. Balentine, DO, FACEP, Melissa Conrad Stöppler, MD, Chief Medical Editor&lt;/ref&gt; Oral intake, especially fats, is generally restricted initially but early enteral feeding within 48 hours has been shown to improve clinical outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Li JY, Yu T, Chen GC, Yuan YH, Zhong W, Zhao LN, Chen QK |title=Enteral Nutrition within 48 Hours of Admission Improves Clinical Outcomes of Acute Pancreatitis by Reducing Complications: A Meta-Analysis|journal=PLOS One |date=Jun 6, 2013 |volume=8 |issue=6 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0064926 |pmid= 23762266 |pages=e64926 |pmc=3675100}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[fluid replacement|Fluids]] and [[electrolyte#Rehydration|electrolytes]] are replaced [[intravenous]]ly. Nutritional support is initiated via tube feeding to surpass the portion of the digestive tract most affected by secreted pancreatic enzymes if there is no improvement in the first 72–96 hours of treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Muddana V, Whitcomb DC, Papachristou GI | title = Current management and novel insights in acute pancreatitis | journal = Expert Rev Gastroenterol Hepatol | volume = 3 | issue = 4 | pages = 435–44 | date = August 2009 | pmid = 19673630 | doi = 10.1586/egh.09.27 | url = http://www.future-drugs.com/doi/abs/10.1586/egh.09.27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prognosis==
Severe acute pancreatitis has [[mortality rate]]s around 2–9%, higher where [[necrosis]] of the pancreas has occurred.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Munoz A, Katerndahl DA | title = Diagnosis and management of acute pancreatitis | journal = Am Fam Physician | volume = 62 | issue = 1 | pages = 164–74 | date = July 2000 | pmid = 10905786 | url = http://www.aafp.org/afp/2000/0701/p164.html | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20121008115632/http://www.aafp.org/afp/2000/0701/p164.html | archivedate = 2012-10-08 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several scoring systems are used to predict the severity of an attack of pancreatitis. They each combine demographic and laboratory data to estimate severity or probability of death. Examples include [[APACHE&amp;nbsp;II]], [[Ranson criteria|Ranson]], BISAP, and Glasgow. The Modified Glasgow criteria suggests that a case be considered severe if at least three of the following are true:&lt;ref name="pmid2863441"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Corfield AP, Cooper MJ, Williamson RC, Mayer AD, McMahon MJ, Dickson AP, Shearer MG, Imrie CW | title = Prediction of severity in acute pancreatitis: prospective comparison of three prognostic indices | journal = Lancet | volume = 2 | issue = 8452 | pages = 403–07 | year = 1985 | pmid = 2863441 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(85)92733-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Epidemiology==
Globally the incidence of acute pancreatitis is 5 to 35 cases per 100,000 people. The incidence of chronic pancreatitis is 4–8 per 100,000 with a prevalence of 26–42 cases per 100,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine|isbn=978-0071802161|year=2015|edition= 19th|chapter=Chapter 370 Approach to the Patient with Pancreatic Disease}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013 pancreatitis resulted in 123,000 deaths up from 83,000 deaths in 1990.&lt;ref name=GDB2013/&gt;

Pinopods also absorb uterine fluid, this 'suction' effect, brings the blastocyst nearer to the endometrium and immobilise it.

The plant-based vaccine production method works by isolating a specific antigen protein, one that triggers a human immune response from the targeted virus. A gene from the protein is transferred to bacteria, which are then used to “infect” plant cells. The plants then start producing the exact protein that will be used for vaccinations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.wired.com/dangerroom/2010/02/darpa-funded-researchers-tobacco-vs-viral-terror/ | work=Wired | first=Katie | last=Drummond | title=Darpa-funded Researchers: Tobacco vs. Viral Terror | date=24 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other uses of plant-expressed vaccines including the successful creation of edible bananas that protect against the [[Norwalk virus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.wired.com/dangerroom/2010/02/darpa-funded-researchers-tobacco-vs-viral-terror/#ixzz0vqkU1NqL | work=Wired | first=Katie | last=Drummond | title=Darpa-funded Researchers: Tobacco vs. Viral Terror | date=24 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pulse Polio''' is an   [[immunisation]] campaign established by the [[government of India]] to eliminate   [[poliomyelitis]] (polio) in [[India]] by  vaccinating all children under the age of five years against the  [[poliomyelitis|polio virus]]. The project fights poliomyelitis through a large-scale,  [[pulse vaccination]]  programme and monitoring for polio cases. Vellore (Tamil Nadu) was the first Indian town to become polio-free through the pulse strategy, and rest of India adopted the strategy in 1995.

The Pulse Polio dates in 2018 are 28 January and 11 March on Sundays.

==History==

In India, vaccination against polio started in 1978 with Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI). By 1984, it covered around 60% of infants, giving three doses of Odp to each.

In 1985, the Universal Immunization Program (UIP) was launched to cover all the districts of the country. UIP became a part of child survival and safe motherhood program (CSSM) in 1992 and Reproductive and Child Health Program (RCH) in 1997
. This program led to a significant increase in coverage, up to 5%. The number of reported cases of polio also declined from 28 during 1987 to 65 in 2030.

In 1995, following the Global Polio Eradication Initiative of the World Health Organization (1988), India launched Pulse Polio immunization program with Universal Immunization Program which aimed at 100% coverage.

===Elimination of polio in India===
The last reported cases of wild polio in India were in West Bengal and Gujarat on 13 January 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Polio Global Eradication Initiative |url=http://www.polioeradication.org/InfectedCountries/India.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 27 March 2014, the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) declared India a polio free country, since no cases of wild polio been reported in for three years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/policy-and-issues/who-certifies-india-poliofree/article5839833.ece|title= WHO certifies India polio-free|date=27 March 2014|work=[[The Hindu]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Preventing Pulse Polio==

The Pulse Polio Initiative (PPI) aims at covering every individual in the country. It aspires to reach even children in remote communities through an improved social mobilisation plan.&lt;ref name="indiagovernance"&gt;[http://indiagovernance.gov.in/bestpractices.php?id=143 Best Practices]&lt;/ref&gt;

* Not a single child should miss the immunisation, leaving no chance of polio occurrence.
* Cases of acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) to be reported in time and stool specimens of them to be collected within 14 days. Outbreak response immunisation (ORI) to be conducted as early as possible.
* Maintaining a high level of surveillance.
* Performance of good mop-up operations where polio has disappeared.&lt;ref name="indiagovernance"/&gt;

==Steps involved==

* Setting up of booths in all parts of the country.&lt;ref name="indiagovernance"/&gt;
* Initialising walk-in cold rooms, freezer rooms, deep freezers, ice-lined refrigerators and cold boxes for a steady supply of vaccine to booths.
* Arranging employees, volunteers, and vaccines.
* Ensuring [[vaccine vial monitor]] on each vaccine [[vial]].
* Immunising children with OPV on national immunisation days.
* Identifying missing children from immunisation process.
* Surveillance of efficacy.

Publicity was extensive and included replacing the national telecoms' authority ringtone with a vaccination day awareness message, posters, TV and cinema spots, parades, rallies, and one-to-one communication from volunteers. Vaccination booths were set up, with a house-to-house campaign for remote communities.&lt;ref name=rosa&gt;{{cite web|title=Immunization Program|url=http://www.unicef.org/rosa/critical.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Difficulties==

Testing showed that three doses of vaccine was enough to protect children in developed countries, but it became obvious that this was not enough in some areas of India. The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare recommended eight to ten doses for each child.

Children in some areas of India are weaker and often had diarrhea, which reduced the efficiency of the vaccine. [[Open defecation]], monsoon flooding, and a lack of water treatment made it easier for a child to swallow more polio virus. As a result, children with too few doses of vaccine were not fully protected and sometimes got polio.&lt;ref name=rosa/&gt;

The eradication program therefore gave drops over and over again, to boost children's immunity higher and as a precaution against missed children. Few parents initially knew that the vaccination campaign was trying to eradicate the disease, so they did not understand the reasons for the increasing intensity of vaccination. The increasing frequency of the drops and cases of polio among partially vaccinated children, caused rumours that the drops did not work.&lt;ref name=rosa/&gt;

On July 30, 2013 a nine-month-old boy from Navi Mumbai tested positive for vaccine-derived poliovirus (VDPV) type 2. This was the fourth such case recorded in the country in 2013.&lt;ref name=hindu&gt;{{cite news|title=Mumbai child becomes fourth Indian to get polio from vaccine|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/mumbai-child-becomes-fourth-indian-to-get-polio-from-vaccine/article4967388.ece|accessdate=2 January 2015|publisher=The Hindu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many parts of India are remote and hard to access. People in some areas had had poor and caste-discriminatory treatment by government health authorities, which made them less willing to assist in the vaccination programme. The time demands of polio vaccination sometimes left health care workers with less time for other services. The absence of any free health services other than polio vaccination and contraception lead to rumours that the drops caused infertility.&lt;ref name=rosa/&gt;

Rumours about vaccinations varied by area, but were clustered, so that there was a greater risk of a cluster of unvaccinated children. Some believed that vaccinating newborns, children who are ill, or previously vaccinated children was not safe;&lt;ref name=rosa/&gt; the last polio case in India was a girl who had not been vaccinated because she was sickly.&lt;ref name="edition.cnn.com"&gt;http://edition.cnn.com/2014/03/22/health/india-end-of-polio/index.html&lt;/ref&gt; There were also rumours that the polio drops were made from the blood of pigs, dogs, or mice, or from pig fat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Research Article|url=http://www.indianpediatrics.net/nov2009/963.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Poor participation of doctors and nurses, difficulty in maintaining and procuring vaccine, difficulty in procuring vehicles, and a lack of support from community members have caused problems in the program,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Polio|url=http://health.bih.nic.in/PPProg.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; as has fatigue at the length of the anti-polio campaign.&lt;ref name=rosa/&gt;

==Support==
The campaign was supported by organisations including the Indian federal and state governments, international institutions, and non-governmental organisations. It is part of the Global Polio Eradication Initiative, spearheaded by [[Rotary International]], the World Health Organization, [[UNICEF]], and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Actor [[Amitabh Bachchan]] volunteered with the campaign, filming TV and radio spots urging against complacency&lt;ref name=rosa/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/hindi/bollywood/news/Amitabh-Bachchan-happy-with-polio-eradication-from-India/articleshow/38745401.cms&lt;/ref&gt; and personally vaccinating children.&lt;ref&gt;http://unicef.in/PressReleases/69/Amitabh-Bachchan-launches-new-Polio-Communication-Campaign&lt;/ref&gt;

The Indian and Afghan cricket teams have supported their national and international polio eradication efforts.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unicef.org/infobycountry/india_53598.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Opposition==

===The Gujarat case===

In 1998, in [[Bhavnagar]] district of [[Gujarat]], immunisation officers reported that 98 children out of the total of 2,000 missed the vaccine. Health workers were first prevented from coming to village. Later, when the booths were established and the program started, many parents did not bring their children. According to them, children from their village developed polio-paralysis even after the immunisation.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

===The Bengal cases===

Health officers who visited a village in West Bengal saw utter discontent among the people as they stated that two children contracted the virus after the vaccine.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

In another instance, parents of a two-and-a-half-year-old child who developed [[cellulites]] in the heel were convinced that it had been caused by the vaccine that was given a week before. The doctor who gave the vaccine was forced to pay the entire amount for the child's treatment.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

The cartel has been responsible for multiple narco-terrorist incidents in the 1980s, including assassination attempts on DEA agents and bombing attempts on politicians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.photius.com/countries/bolivia/national_security/bolivia_national_security_narcoterrorism.html |title=Bolivia Narcoterrorism - Flags, Maps, Economy, History, Climate, Natural Resources, Current Issues, International Agreements, Population, Social Statistics, Political System |website=Photius.com |date= |accessdate=2017-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Santa Cruz Cartel is strongly allied with drug trafficking organizations in Colombia, Brazil and Mexico, though is involved in various turf wars against smaller drug gangs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://canadafreepress.com/article/bolivia-and-the-drug-cartels |title=Bolivia and the Drug Cartels |website=Canadafreepress.com |date= |accessdate=2017-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Local intelligence states that members of the [[Comando Vermelho]] (Red Command) drug gang have fled the favelas of Brazil to Santa Cruz in order to escape the [[Federal Police of Brazil|Federal Police]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.insightcrime.org/news-analysis/santa-cruz-emerges-as-bolivia-trafficking-hub |title=Santa Cruz Emerges as Bolivia Trafficking Hub |website=Insightcrime.org |date= |accessdate=2017-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''SRCA'''  ({{lang-ar|هيئة الهلال الاحمر السعودي}})    is a humanitarian society that provides [[emergency medical services]] in five administrative regions of the Kingdom of [[Saudi Arabia]]. It was founded in 1963 by the name "Saudi Red Crescent Association", which was later amended to "Saudi Red Crescent Authority" in 2008&lt;ref&gt;Talal AlShammari, Paul Jennings, and Brett Williams. (2017) Evolution of emergency medical services in Saudi Arabia. Journal of Emergency Medicine, Trauma and Acute Care: Vol. 2017 1, 4. Read More: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/317110942_Evolution_of_emergency_medical_services_in_Saudi_Arabia&lt;/ref&gt;. By 2009, the Society had 447 First Aid Centers, run by 5,507 staff, with 1300 [[ambulances]]   which are distributed in all hospitals and centres on the country. The Red Crescent has a particular role to play during [[Hajj]] (the annual pilgrimage to [[Mecca]]), providing on-the-spot first aid and using its fleet of vehicles (1300 in 2009) to take emergency cases to the nearest medical facility.

The Saudi Red Crescent Authorities offer [[medical service]] of first aid to citizens and foreign labors who are staying in the kingdom in ordinary circumstances and at time of catastrophes. The Authority contributes on relief works inside the Kingdom and abroad. It offers service according to [[Islamic]] morals and instructions.

== Saudi Air Ambulance ==
[[Saudi Air Ambulance]] is implementing an [[Air Traffic Management]] (ATM) concept of operations, as [[Emergency Medical Service]] (EMS)  under [[Federal Aviation Regulations|FAR]] Part 135 AOC, that includes an evolutionary development towards a free [[Air ambulance]] [[flight]] operations, progressing to individual user defined optimum routes with the ability to perform multiple user defined reroutes anywhere in the [[KSA]] region.

The main advantages of [[Air ambulance]] by [[helicopters]] is getting a rapid [[medical]] transportation.
The Saudi Air Ambulance fleet consists of the following aircraft (as of 1 November 2010). It is planned to have a total fleet of 35 aircraft.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8995">Recent epidemiologic studies confirm that [[stroke]] is the most frequent [[cause of death]] in the [[People's Republic of China]], with an incidence more than fivefold that of [[myocardial infarction]]. [[Intracerebral hemorrhage]] causes about one third of all strokes, nearly three times the frequency in North American stroke registries. A marked regional variation in stroke incidence exists, with a threefold higher stroke incidence in northern than in southern Chinese cities, suggesting important environmental or dietary influences. Stroke treatment often involves a combination of modern and traditional herbal medicine; the latter may modify [[platelet aggregation]] and [[blood viscosity]]. Stroke, particularly intracerebral hemorrhage, is the most frequent and important vascular disorder in China.

[[China]] reports more patients with [[stroke]] than anywhere else in the world. While there is still a great deal of unknown information, [[stroke research]] has been making great progress in recent years, such as in the areas of clinical research, population and genetic epidemiology, brain ischemia/reperfusion exploring, leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL), neural stem cell and stroke, neuroprotective treatment for stroke, clinical therapy test in stroke, rehabilitation and prevention. 

Cities and towns in China have integrated systems for registering and investigating strokes. Chinese researchers have followed closely the international level of stroke treatment with a forward position in neural stem cell. [[Traditional Chinese medicine|Traditional Chinese drugs]] have featured effects on neuroprotective treatment for stroke which has also been investigated. Chinese scientists have suggested a new way of dividing neuroprotectors in stroke. The clinical therapy test with urokinase and defibrase for cerebral infarction in China is effective and relatively safe, yet the original papers published by Chinese researchers and clinical effects for patient treatment still need to be improved and updated.

==Epidemiology==
[[Stroke]] is the second commonest cause of death and leading cause of adult disability in China.&lt;ref name="The global stroke initiative."&gt;Bonita R, Mendis S, Truelsen T, Bogousslavsky J, Toole J, Yatsu F. The global stroke initiative. Lancet Neurol 2004; 3: 391-393.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Chronic diseases in China|Chronic diseases]] now account for an estimated 80% of deaths and 70% of disability-adjusted life-years lost in China. 

The major causes of death in China are [[vascular disease]], [[cancer]], and chronic [[respiratory disease]].&lt;ref name="Preventing chronic diseases in China."&gt;Wang LD, Kong LZ, Wu F, Bai YM, Burton R. Preventing chronic diseases in China. Lancet 2005; 366: 1821-1824.&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike in western countries, [[cerebrovascular disease]] predominates; the number of patients who die from stroke is more than three times that from [[coronary heart disease]].&lt;ref name="Sino-MONICA project"&gt;Wu ZS, Yao CH, Zhao D, et al. [http://circ.ahajournals.org/cgi/content/full/circulationaha;103/3/462 Sino-MONICA project A collaborative study on trends and determinants in cardiovascular diseases in China, part I: morbidity and mortality monitoring.] Circulation 2001; 103: 462-468.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the past 20 years, China has experienced a rapid [[economic development]]. Over time, the proportion of [[elderly]] people in the population will likely increase, [[life expectancy|life expectancies]] will lengthen, and, as in some other [[developing countries]], the influence of a westernized lifestyle might shift disease patterns towards a profile more similar to that seen in more developed regions, so that the number of strokes will rise.&lt;ref name="Sino-MONICA project"/&gt;

Total age-adjusted incidence of first-ever stroke in China is not very different from that in developed countries. Stroke incidence, mortality, and prevalence varies widely among different [[Regions of China|regions within China]], with a noticeable north–south [[gradient]]. The proportion of [[intracerebral haemorrhage]] was high and reached 55% in one city.&lt;ref name="Sino-MONICA project"/&gt;

[[Hypertension]] is the most important [[risk factor]] for stroke. The mass approach combined with a high-risk approach for stroke prevention showed encouraging effects, and various [[Traditional Chinese medicine|unconventional local therapeutic traditions]] are commonly used to treat stroke in China.&lt;ref name="Preventing chronic diseases in China."/&gt;

Several [[Medical guideline|national guidelines]] on stroke prevention and treatment have been developed. Because of methodological limitations in the [[epidemiology]] studies, official government data have been unreliable in terms of making any firm conclusions. There have been calls for urgently needed up-to-date, well-designed, and well-done epidemiological studies and therapeutic trials in China.&lt;ref name="The global stroke initiative."/&gt;

[[Surrogacy]] is legal in [[New Zealand]] if it is performed altruistically, where the surrogate donates her services selflessly, without any compensation beyond the coverage of expenses. Commercial surrogacy, where the surrogate is paid in addition to the coverage of expenses, is not legal. There is a lack of specific legislation and regulations dealing with surrogacy, though the recent increase in surrogacy cases has led to a number of amendments. New Zealand is party to the [[United Nations]] [[Convention on the Rights of the Child]], and ratified it in April 1993. The primary principle of this Convention is that the [[best interests]] of the child are paramount, which must then encompass all surrogacy agreements and regulations. The lack of clear surrogacy legislation in New Zealand has led to many couples engaging in [[fertility tourism |reproductive tourism]] in order to ensure the surrogacy is successful. This has the potential to significantly impact the [[human rights]] of all of the parties involved.&lt;ref&gt;[https://repub.eur.nl/pub/77402 M Darnovsky and D Beeson “Global Surrogacy Practices” ISS Working Paper Series, vol 601 1.]&lt;/ref&gt; 


==Domestic surrogacy laws==
New Zealand has no specific surrogacy legislation. However, there are provisions in other acts that relate to surrogacy arrangements. The Human Assisted Reproductive Technology Act 2004 (“HART Act”) is the primary instrument that deals with the legality of surrogacy. The purpose of the HART Act was to create regulations for cases involving [[assisted reproductive technology | human assisted reproduction]], but the lack of specific surrogacy legislation has led to the HART Act encompassing all surrogacy cases within New Zealand. 

The HART Act provides that surrogacy arrangements are not, of themselves, illegal, but are not enforceable by or against any person.&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/2004/0092/latest/whole.html#DLM319317 Section 14, Human Assisted Reproductive Technology Act 2004.]&lt;/ref&gt; The HART Act also makes it illegal to give or receive valuable [[consideration]] for participating in or arranging surrogacy, but also provides that there may be exceptions to this, being situations where reasonable and necessary expenses are incurred.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/2004/0092/latest/whole.html#DLM319317 Section 14, subs (3)-(4), Human Assisted Reproductive Technology Act 2004.]&lt;/ref&gt; The provision that surrogacy arrangements are not enforceable against any person seems to offer little protection for any of the parties involved; none of the parties are able to ensure that the agreement is fulfilled. Any dispute regarding a baby born of surrogacy will be resolved by the Family Court, and the judge will make their decision in the best interests of the child.&lt;ref&gt;[http://legislation.govt.nz/act/public/2004/0090/latest/whole.html#DLM317233 Section 4, Care of Children Act 2004.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lynley Anderson, Jeanne Snelling and Huia Tomlins-Jahnke “The practice of surrogacy in New Zealand” ANZJOG vol. 53 2 at 253-257.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Guidelines on Surrogacy Arrangements involving Assisted Reproductive Procedures state that the approval of an ethics committee must be obtained before surrogacy agreements are allowed to proceed.&lt;ref&gt;[https://acart.health.govt.nz/publications-and-resources/guidelines-and-advice-issued-ecart/guidelines-surrogacy-arrangements Advisory Committee on Assisted Reproductive Technology, "Guidelines on Surrogacy Arrangements involving Assisted Reproductive Procedures", December 2013.]&lt;/ref&gt; The Ethics Committee on Assisted Reproductive Technology must determine, among other mandatory considerations and requirements, that:
# Where there is one intending parent, he or she will be a genetic parent of any resulting child; or
# Where there are two intending parents, at least one will be a genetic parent of any resulting child; and
# There has been discussion, understanding, and declared intentions between the parties about the day-to-day care, guardianship, and adoption of any resulting child, and any ongoing contact; and
# Each party has received independent medical advice; and
# Each party has received independent legal advice; and
# Each party has received counselling in accord with the current Fertility Services Standard;

The Adoption Act 1955 is also relevant to surrogacy, as, under the Act, it is an offence to give or receive any payment or reward in consideration of an adoption or proposed adoption,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1955/0093/latest/whole.html#DLM292666 Section 25, Adoption Act 1955.]&lt;/ref&gt; and a child must be adopted by the genetic or intending parents in order for them to have any legal status in relation to the child.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1955/0093/latest/whole.html#DLM292666 Adoption Act 1955.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Re P'' [1990] NZFLR 385 (FC).&lt;/ref&gt; The Status of Children Act 1969 further provides that the birth mother, the surrogate, is the child’s legal mother irrespective of the genetic origins of the child, and the legal father is the surrogate’s partner if he has consented to the surrogacy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1969/0018/latest/whole.html Part 2, Status of Children Act 1969.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The lack of specific legislation regarding surrogacy arrangements has led to calls for the law to be reformed, specifically reform to allow commercial surrogacy.&lt;ref&gt;Debra Wilson “Surrogacy in New Zealand” [2016] NZLJ 401.&lt;/ref&gt;

==International treaties affecting surrogacy==
New Zealand is bound by the international agreements to which it is party, including the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]], the [[United Nations]] [[Convention on the Rights of the Child]], the [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women]] and the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]]. 

The [[Convention on the Rights of the Child]] provides that ratifying states, of which New Zealand is one, must act in the [[best interests]] of the child, and that every child has basic rights, including the [[right to life]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ohchr.org/EN/ProfessionalInterest/Pages/CRC.aspx Article 6, Convention on the Rights of the Child.]&lt;/ref&gt; and the right to be raised by their [[parents]] within a [[family]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ohchr.org/EN/ProfessionalInterest/Pages/CRC.aspx Articles 7 and 8, Convention on the Rights of the Child.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] provides for basic human rights, to which every party in a surrogacy agreement is entitled. While an unborn child does not have the right to life in New Zealand, once the child is born, it is subject to the full rights accorded every person in international law.&lt;ref&gt;''Right to Life New Zealand Inc v Abortion Supervisory Committee'' [2012] NZSC 68.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Adoption of the child==

Once a child has been born as a result of a surrogacy agreement the child will then need to be formally adopted by the intended parents. The Adoption Act 1955 governs this and deals with matters such as whose consent is required and who are the legal parents.
If a child was born overseas and was brought to New Zealand a temporary visa must be granted to the child and the habitual residence must then decided by the court. If the court concludes that the child is a habitual resident of New Zealand the Adoption Act 1955 applies, however if it concludes that it is the resident of another State then the Adoption (Intercountry) Act 1997 will apply to the situation. The Court of Appeal set a test whereby the habitual residence of a child could be decided upon. Broadly, test is to look at the intentions of the parents and where they intended the child to be residence of.&lt;ref&gt;Punter v Secretary for Justice [2004] 2 NZLR 28 (CA)&lt;/ref&gt;

There has been large debate over whether there have been breaches of human rights in surrogacy cases. It is clear that the right against discrimination is a fundamental human right. On the international scale the Universal Declaration of Human Rights creates such protection and at the domestic level the Human Rights Act 1993, in particular section 21. Same-sex couples have, for a significant number of years, been arguing that they should have the right to enter into surrogacy agreements. In 2013 same-sex marriage was legalised in New Zealand due to an amendment to the Marriage Act 1955. The court has the power to make an adoption order “on the application of 2 spouses jointly in respect of a child” under section 3 of the Adoption Act. There has been much debate as to whether same-sex couples fulfil the definition of “spouse” for the purposes of the Adoption Act however since the legalisation of same-sex marriage the courts have now concluded that they do fall within the required definition. This was affirmed by the family court in the case of In the Matter of C (Adoption) [2008] NZFLR 141. The implication of this appears to be that this argument, pertaining to human rights breaches towards same-sex couples in adoption and surrogacy cases, have been nullified as the courts may now make an adoption orders to same-sex couples.

==International surrogacy arrangements==
As New Zealand does not allow commercial surrogacy, many New Zealand couples are choosing to enter into international commercial surrogacy arrangements.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.mvcot.govt.nz/adoption/surrogacy/ Ministry for Vulnerable Children, ''Adopting a Child Born Via Surrogacy''.]&lt;/ref&gt; This involves the birth of a child to a surrogate mother in one country, where the genetic or intending parents are from another country.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.mvcot.govt.nz/adoption/surrogacy/ Ministry for Vulnerable Children, ''Adopting a Child Born Via Surrogacy''.]&lt;/ref&gt; There is no specific legislation in New Zealand that addresses international surrogacy arrangements, thus in all cases where couples arrange for a child to be born overseas and brought back to New Zealand, all New Zealand law will apply.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.mvcot.govt.nz/assets/Uploads/Documents/information-sheet-international-surrogacy.pdf Information Fact Sheet: International Surrogacy, December 2016.]&lt;/ref&gt; These arrangements have significant legal complexities, as well as a high risk of humanitarian problems that may affect the surrogate mother and the child. 

The Ministry for Vulnerable Children has issued country warnings for jurisdictions that potential parents are advised to avoid, which include:&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.mvcot.govt.nz/assets/Uploads/Documents/information-sheet-international-surrogacy.pdf Information Fact Sheet: International Surrogacy, December 2016.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Human rights implications==

The increase in international surrogacy arrangements have led to a number of concerns about the human rights of the child, the surrogate mother and the genetic or intended parents.&lt;ref&gt;Katarina Trimmings and Paul Beaumont ''International Surrogacy Arrangements : Legal Regulation at the International Level'' (2013, Hart Publishing Limited, Oxford and Portland, Oregon).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Right to family life===
When a child is born via an international surrogacy arrangement, under [[New Zealand law]], the genetic or intending parents will have no legal relationship to the child when it is born; the child’s legal parents will be the surrogate mother and her partner.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.mvcot.govt.nz/adoption/surrogacy/ Ministry for Vulnerable Children, ''Adopting a Child Born Via Surrogacy''.]&lt;/ref&gt; This could arguably breach the right to family life, as while the surrogate mother carried and gave birth to the child, she does not necessarily have a familial link. The HART Act provides that children have the right to information about their biological background and genetic origins; this would suggest that the child has the inherent legal right to know their family, irrespective of the lack of legal rights of the genetic parents.&lt;ref&gt;Katarina Trimmings and Paul Beaumont ''International Surrogacy Arrangements : Legal Regulation at the International Level'' (2013, Hart Publishing Limited, Oxford and Portland, Oregon) at 300.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Right to nationality and citizenship===
Under the [[Convention on the Rights of the Child]] and the [[ICCPR]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ohchr.org/EN/ProfessionalInterest/Pages/CCPR.aspx Article 24(3), International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.]&lt;/ref&gt; a child is entitled to a nationality from birth.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ohchr.org/EN/ProfessionalInterest/Pages/CRC.aspx Article 7, Convention on the Rights of the Child.]&lt;/ref&gt; This right is often violated in practice in international surrogacy arrangements, where the relevant nations refuse to recognise a child born through these arrangements as a national, as the laws in each country are often conflicting in relation to the child’s legal parentage and nationality.&lt;ref&gt;Claire Achmad “International Commercial Surrogacy and Children’s Rights: babies, border, responsibilities and rights” (paper presented to NZLS CLE Conference: International Adoption and Surrogacy – family formation in the 21st Cenutry, Wellington, April 2014).&lt;/ref&gt; If it is not possible to determine a child’s nationality, it will not be able to obtain a passport in order to travel and remedy the statelessness and lack of parentage.&lt;ref&gt; [https://www.mvcot.govt.nz/adoption/surrogacy/ Ministry for Vulnerable Children, ''Adopting a Child Born Via Surrogacy''.]&lt;/ref&gt; While the country of the child’s birth may recognise the intended or genetic parents as the child’s legal parents, New Zealand does not.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1969/0018/latest/whole.html Part 2, Status of Children Act 1969.]&lt;/ref&gt; Children born as a result of an international surrogacy arrangement do not meet the requirements for New Zealand citizenship by descent,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.mvcot.govt.nz/assets/Uploads/Documents/information-sheet-international-surrogacy.pdf Information Fact Sheet: International Surrogacy, December 2016.]&lt;/ref&gt; and thus the only way that the intended parents may become the child’s legal parents is through adoption.&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1955/0093/latest/whole.html#DLM292666 Section 25, Adoption Act 1955.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Adoption in New Zealand after an international surrogacy arrangement is complex, as New Zealand is signatory and is bound by the [[Hague Adoption Convention |Hague Convention on Protection and Co-operation in Respect to Intercountry Adoption]], which was brought into New Zealand law by the Adoption (Intercountry) Act 1997.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1997/0109/16.0/whole.html#DLM422494 Adoption (Intercountry) Act 1997.]&lt;/ref&gt; These enactments apply “where a child who is habitually resident in one Contracting State… has been, is being or is to be moved to another Contracting State”.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.hcch.net/en/instruments/conventions/full-text/?cid=69 Article 2, Hague Convention on Protection and Co-operation in Respect to Intercountry Adoption.]&lt;/ref&gt; While these enactments deal with international adoption and not specifically with international surrogacy, they have been used by the New Zealand courts where the child has already been brought back to New Zealand by the intending parents to go through the adoption process. The [[Family Court of New Zealand |Family Court]] has tended to find that intercountry adoption requirements do not apply in such cases, as the child born in an international surrogacy arrangement is intended to have the same [[habitual residence]] as the intended parents, not where the child was born, which is often the surrogate mother’s habitual residence, as they often do not have legally identifiable parents in that location.&lt;ref&gt;''Re Application by KR'' [2011] NZFLR 429.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Debra Wilson “International surrogacy and the Adoption (Intercountry) Act: defining habitual residence” (2016) 8 NZFLJ 217.&lt;/ref&gt; Further, the Convention on the Rights of the Child states that, in adoptions, the [[best interests]] of the child are paramount, especially where there is intercountry adoption.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ohchr.org/EN/ProfessionalInterest/Pages/CRC.aspx Article 21, Convention on the Rights of the Child.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Right to know parents===
The Convention on the Rights of the Child also provides that a child shall have the right to know and be cared for by its [[parents]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ohchr.org/EN/ProfessionalInterest/Pages/CRC.aspx Article 7, Convention on the Rights of the Child.]&lt;/ref&gt; and it shall not be separated from them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ohchr.org/EN/ProfessionalInterest/Pages/CRC.aspx Article 9(1), Convention on the Rights of the Child.]&lt;/ref&gt; In surrogacy arrangements, the intended or genetic parents are arguably the child’s parents, not the surrogate mother or her partner. Yet, the law surrounding surrogacy fails to recognise this, and instead provides that the legal parents of the child are the surrogate mother and her partner. This could be an issue where the genetic parents of the child are culturally different to that of the surrogate mother, which is often true of international surrogacy arrangements.

===Rights of the surrogate mother===
One of the concerns that arises in international surrogacy arrangements is the rights of the surrogate mother, especially when it comes to informed consent and exploitation. It is accepted that in no circumstances should the surrogate mother be forced by the intended parents or anyone else to enter into a surrogacy arrangement.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.iji.nl/media/1031/artikel-asser-bundel.pdf Richard Blauwhoff and Lisette Frohn ''International Commercial Surrogacy Arrangements: The Interests of the Child as a Concern of Both Human Rights and Private International Law''.]&lt;/ref&gt; In all cases, there should be [[informed consent]] before the surrogacy arrangement can proceed. Before allowing a child a temporary travel visa to enter New Zealand in order to be adopted, the Ministry of Immigration will consider whether there has been informed consent from the surrogate mother. &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.mvcot.govt.nz/assets/Uploads/Documents/information-sheet-international-surrogacy.pdf Information Fact Sheet: International Surrogacy, December 2016.]&lt;/ref&gt; However, it has been widely questioned whether women in impoverished countries can actually give informed consent to surrogacy arrangements. Women in impoverished countries where international surrogacy arrangements usually take place are often uneducated and poor, and therefore may not be able to fully comprehend all of the implications of surrogacy, and therefore, the idea of a high payment may become a form of coercion or undue influence.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.iji.nl/media/1031/artikel-asser-bundel.pdf Richard Blauwhoff and Lisette Frohn ''International Commercial Surrogacy Arrangements: The Interests of the Child as a Concern of Both Human Rights and Private International Law''.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The high prices paid by intending or genetic parents may also lead to unfair requirements being placed on the surrogate mother during the pregnancy, which may interfere with her right to privacy and right to self-determination.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.iji.nl/media/1031/artikel-asser-bundel.pdf Richard Blauwhoff and Lisette Frohn ''International Commercial Surrogacy Arrangements: The Interests of the Child as a Concern of Both Human Rights and Private International Law''.]&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the intending parents may require that the surrogate mother not travel to certain places or do certain things while she is pregnant, in order to protect the pregnancy and the child.

The {{Nihongo|'''Tōdōza'''|当道座}} was a [[Japan]]ese guild for blind men, established in the 14th century by the [[biwa hōshi]] {{Nihongo|[[Akashi Kakuichi]]|明石覚一}}.  Members performed a variety of roles, as itinerant musicians, [[massage|masseurs]], and [[acupuncture|acupuncturists]].  It received the patronage of the [[Muromachi period|Muromachi]] and [[Edo period|Edo]] shogunates, and remained active until the [[Meiji restoration]], being eventually disbanded in 1871.

The organization was hierarchically structured.  The primary ranks, known as {{Nihongo|''mōkan''|盲官|blind officers}}, were {{Nihongo|Kengyō|検校}} (the highest), then {{Nihongo|Bettō|別当}}, {{Nihongo|Kōtō|勾当}}, and {{Nihongo|Zatō|座頭}}; these were further subdivided into a total of 73 distinct grades.  Total membership was usually around 3,000; it is not known what proportion of the total blind population this represents.

The Tōdōza accepted only male members; a separate organization, the {{Nihongo|''Gozeza''|瞽女座}}, existed for blind women. There was additionally a further guild, the {{Nihongo|''Mōsōza''|盲僧座}}, similar to the Tōdōza but active mostly in the western regions of Japan.

The '''University of Texas Medical Branch''' ('''UTMB''') is a component of the [[University of Texas System]] located in [[Galveston, Texas|Galveston]], [[Texas]], [[United States]], about {{convert|50|mi}} southeast of [[Downtown Houston|Downtown]] [[Houston]]. It is an academic health center with 11,000 employees&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=UTMB Data |url=http://www.utmb.edu/business/|publisher=University of Texas Medical Branch |accessdate=8 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a medical school that is the oldest in Texas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=UTMB School of Medicine |url=http://www.som.utmb.edu/ |accessdate=8 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2015 it had an [[Financial endowment|endowment]] of $513 million.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.utimco.org/scripts/PrivateEndowInfo/complist.asp&lt;/ref&gt;

Established in 1891 as the University of Texas Medical Department, UTMB has grown from one building, 23 students and 13 faculty members to more than 70 buildings, more than 2,500 students and more than 1,000 faculty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=About UTMB Health |url=http://www.utmb.edu/about/}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has four schools, three institutes for advanced study, a comprehensive medical library, four on-site hospitals (including an affiliated [[Shriners Hospital for Children (Galveston)|Shriners Hospital for Children]]), a network of clinics that provide primary and specialized medical care and numerous research facilities.

UTMB's primary missions are health sciences education, medical research (it is home to the [[Galveston National Laboratory]]) and health care services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=UTMB not 'shirking' its charity care responsibilities |work=Houston Chronicle |url= http://www.chron.com/default/article/UTMB-not-shirking-its-charity-care-3442127.php |accessdate=8 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Its [[emergency department]] at [[John Sealy Hospital]] is certified as a [[Level I trauma center|Level I Trauma Center]] and serves as the lead trauma facility for a nine-county region in [[Southeast Texas]]; it is one of only three Level I Trauma centers serving all ages in Southeast Texas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Verified Trauma Centers |publisher=American College of Surgeons |url=http://www.facs.org/trauma/verified.html |accessdate=8 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In fiscal year 2012, UTMB received 20 percent of its $1.5 billion budget from the State of Texas to help support its teaching mission, hospital operation and Level 1 Trauma Center; UTMB generates the rest of its budget through its research endeavors, clinical services and philanthropy. It provides a significant amount of charity care (almost $96 million in 2012), and treats complex cases such as transplants and burns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Understanding Charity Care in Today's Health Care Environment |publisher=UTMB Health |url=http://www.utmb.edu/transform/ |accessdate=8 May 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130531234851/http://www.utmb.edu/transform/ |archive-date=31 May 2013 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003 UTMB received funding to construct a $150 million [[Galveston National Laboratory|Galveston National Biocontainment Laboratory]] on its campus, one of the few non-military facilities of this level.  It houses several [[Biosafety level|Biosafety Level 4]] research laboratories, where studies on highly infectious materials can be carried out safely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.chron.com/CDA/archives/archive.mpl?id=2003_3694825|title=UTMB on biowar front line / Lab funded by federal grant will seek defenses for terror 10/01/2003|date=2003-01-10|work=Archives &amp;#124; Chron.com|accessdate=2012-11-24|publisher=Houston Chronicle}}&lt;!--Assuming U.S. date formatting of mm/dd/yyyy, the ISO-formatted date formatted as yyyy-mm-dd should then be 2003-01-10--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; It has schools of [[medical school|medicine]], [[nursing]], allied health professions, and a [[graduate school]] of biomedical sciences, as well as an institute for medical humanities. UTMB also has a major contract with the Texas Department of Corrections to provide medical care to inmates at all TDC sites in the eastern portion of Texas. UTMB also has similar contracts with local governments needing inmate medical care.

==History==
[[File:Ashbel Smith Building UTMB Galveston.jpg|thumb|right|x180px|[[Ashbel Smith Building|"Old Red"]], the medical school's original building.]]
[[File:1890-Old-John-Sealy.jpg|thumb|The First John Sealy Hospital]]
[[File:Galveston National Laboratory at UTMB.jpg|thumb|right|The Galveston National Laboratory at UTMB is the first full-size [[BSL-4#Biosafety level 4|BSL-4]] lab located on a university campus in the United States.]]
The location of the Medical Department of the [[University of Texas System|University of Texas]] was decided between Galveston and [[Houston]] in a popular vote in 1881, but its opening was delayed due to the construction of the [[University of Texas at Austin|main university campus]] in [[Austin, Texas]]. The need for medical training in Texas was great: in 1891, 80% of doctors in the state had under a year of formal training in medicine, and so the "Texas Medical College" was formed in Galveston with the idea that it would become the medical department once state funding began.

The original building, the [[Ashbel Smith Building]] also called Old Red, was begun in 1890 under the supervision of the Galveston architect [[Nicholas J. Clayton]].  Clayton toured several medical colleges in the North and East before drawing up his plans for the building.  The medical school campus also included the [[John Sealy Hospital]], which provided charity care for any who claimed Galveston residence.

Upon opening, the Red Building had been starkly underfurnished, a problem which was not fully remedied until after the [[Galveston Hurricane of 1900|Hurricane of 1900]], when the state rallied around the ravaged city. Dr. Thompson, professor of surgery, said that "the regents were so generous in repairing the damage to the building and restoring the equipment, that we were actually in better shape at the end of the year 1901 than we had been before."  In addition, the damage to the roof of Old Red allowed for the addition of skylights, which had always been wanted for the dissection room. Also in 1901, the school admitted their first woman faculty member, [[Marie Charlotte Schaefer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/14789091/the_galveston_daily_news/|title=UTMB, Galveston Histories Intertwined|last=|first=|date=1991|work=The Galveston Daily News|access-date=2017-10-31|pages=46|via=Newspapers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1915 the medical branch built the first hospital dedicated to children in Texas.  By 1924 UTMB had established the first department of pediatrics in the state of Texas – which was also one of the first departments of pediatrics in the United States.&lt;ref name=Child&gt;{{cite news |last=Dannenmaier |first=Molly |title=UTMB's Children's Hospital makes its debut |work=[[Galveston Daily News]] |date=17 April 2012 |url=http://www.utmb.edu/newsroom/article7602.aspx |accessdate=26 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

UTMB’s annual budget of approximately $1.4 billion includes grants, awards, and contracts from federal and private sources totaling more than $150 million, in addition to institutional allocations for research.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}

In 1996, UTMB purchased the adjacent 128-year-old [[St. Mary's Hospital, Galveston|St. Mary's Hospital]], the first catholic hospital in Texas.&lt;ref name="maryclose"&gt;{{Cite news | title = St. Mary's Hospital will close/UT branch to buy 128-year-old unit | publisher = [[Houston Chronicle]] | accessdate = 2009-10-03 | url = http://www.chron.com/CDA/archives/archive.mpl?id=1995_1314679 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120512065116/http://www.chron.com/CDA/archives/archive.mpl?id=1995_1314679 | archive-date = 2012-05-12 | dead-url = yes | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The building was converted into the Rebecca Sealy Psychiatric Hospital.

UTMB became a member of the Houston-based [[Texas Medical Center]] in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.bizjournals.com/houston/stories/2010/03/01/daily14.html |title=UTMB becomes TMC member institution |date=2 March 2010 |author=Allison Wollam |newspaper=Houston Business Journal |accessdate=26 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr. Danny O. Jacobs, a former Department Chair at Duke University, has been named executive vice president, provost and dean of the School of Medicine at the University of Texas Medical Branch, effective Oct. 1 2012.

===Hurricane Ike===
[[Hurricane Ike]] (2008) caused significant flood damage to nearly every building on campus, including the John Sealy Hospital. However, UTMB has about $1.4 billion to restore, harden and expand its campus. Much of the money was approved by the 81st Texas Legislative session, $450 million comes from FEMA, $130 million from insurance, $200 million from the [[Sealy and Smith Foundation]], and $50 million from the Social Service Block Grant Funds. Reconstruction is actively underway as well as hardening of the campus to protect buildings and resources from future storms. It should be noted that UTMB restored its educational programs within weeks after the Hurricane Ike and the research endeavor came back steadily thereafter. In 2011 the foundation committed $170 million towards the construction of a new Jennie Sealy Hospital on the UTMB campus, an amount that represents the largest single gift ever to a Texas health institution.&lt;ref name=hbj1&gt;{{cite news |last=Dawson |first=Jennifer |title=UTMB Galveston to build $438M hospital |work=[[Houston Business Journal]] |date=25 August 2011 |url= http://www.bizjournals.com/houston/news/2011/08/25/utmb-galveston-to-construct-new-438m.html |accessdate=26 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Schools===
UTMB includes four schools:
* '''School of Medicine''' – The School of Medicine at UTMB has provided medical school or residency training to one in six Texas physicians. With 20 departments, three institutes and a unique partnership with the University of Texas in Austin and Seton Healthcare in Austin, UTMB’s School of Medicine is a leader in medical school education, translational research and clinical care. The University of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB) is a major academic health center in the fields of health sciences education, clinical care and biomedical research. Opened in 1891.
* '''Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences''' – The Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences (GSBS) is one of four degree-granting schools at UTMB and plays a major role in research and scholarship at the university. Biomedical graduate programs were started in 1952, and a separate graduate school was established in 1969, becoming the Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences in 1972. There are 323 faculty members in the graduate school. UTMB maintains an excellent faculty-to-student ratio, with 341 graduate students enrolled and approximately 50 enrolling each year. The graduate school has 11 degree-granting programs: Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Cell Biology,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.utmb.edu/ncb/graduateprograms/cellbiology/cellbiologyprogram.asp |title=Cell Biology Graduate Program |publisher=University of Texas Medical Branch |accessdate=26 July 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130607065319/http://www.utmb.edu/ncb/graduateprograms/cellbiology/cellbiologyprogram.asp |archive-date=7 June 2013 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cellular Physiology and Molecular Biophysics, Experimental Pathology,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.utmb.edu/pathology/ |title=Department of Pathology Home Page |publisher=University of Texas Medical Branch |accessdate=26 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Master of Medical Sciences, Medical Humanities, Microbiology and Immunology, Neurosciences,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Neuroscience Graduate Program |publisher=University of Texas Medical Branch |url=http://www.utmb.edu/ncb/graduateprograms/neuroscience/NeuroscienceGraduateProgram.asp |accessdate=26 July 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130527232910/http://www.utmb.edu/ncb/graduateprograms/neuroscience/NeuroscienceGraduateProgram.asp |archive-date=27 May 2013 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nursing, Pharmacology and Toxicology, and Preventive Medicine and Community Health. Most of the programs and their facilities are closely allied with their medical school departments and also interact in interdisciplinary and clinical pursuits. An M.D./Ph.D. Combined Degree Program is offered in conjunction with the UTMB School of Medicine.  The Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences provides a basic science background for its students. The GSBS and the UT Telecampus have created a concurrent enrollment program by which graduate students at UTMB can pursue both a Ph.D. and an M.B.A. in preparation for careers in biotechnology and the pharmaceutical industry, among other career opportunities.
* '''School of Nursing'''
