[[Iron]] represents perhaps the best-known example for [[allotropy]] in a [[metal]]. At [[atmospheric pressure]], three allotropic forms of iron exist: alpha iron (α), gamma iron (γ) (also known as [[austenite]]), and delta iron (δ). At very high pressure, a fourth form exists, called epsilon iron (ε) [[hexaferrum]]. Some controversial experimental evidence exists for another high-pressure form that is stable at very high pressures and temperatures.&lt;ref name="HTP-iron"&gt;{{Cite journal| first = Reinhard| last = Boehler|title = High-pressure experiments and the phase diagram of lower mantle and core materials| journal = Reviews of Geophysics| volume = 38| pages = 221–245| publisher = American Geophysical Union| year = 2000| doi=10.1029/1998RG000053|bibcode = 2000RvGeo..38..221B| issue = 2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The phases of iron at atmospheric pressure are important because of the differences in solubility of [[carbon]], forming different types of [[steel]]. The high-pressure phases of iron are important as models for the solid parts of planetary cores. The [[inner core]] of the [[Earth]] is generally assumed to consist essentially of a crystalline iron-[[nickel]] [[alloy]] with ε structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cohen |first=Ronald |author2=Stixrude, Lars |url=http://www.psc.edu/science/Cohen_Stix/cohen_stix.html |title=Crystal at the Center of the Earth |accessdate=2007-02-05 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070205041442/http://www.psc.edu/science/Cohen_Stix/cohen_stix.html |archivedate=5 February 2007 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Stixrude |first=Lars |last2=Cohen |first2=R.E. |title=High-Pressure Elasticity of Iron and Anisotropy of Earth's Inner Core |journal=Science |volume=267 |issue=5206 |pages=1972–5 |date=March 1995 |pmid=17770110 |doi=10.1126/science.267.5206.1972 |url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/267/5206/1972|bibcode=1995Sci...267.1972S }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-14678004 |publisher=BBC News |title=What is at the centre of the Earth? |date=31 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The outer core surrounding the solid inner core is believed to be composed of liquid iron mixed with nickel and trace amounts of lighter elements.

==Standard pressure allotropes==

===Delta iron (δ-Fe)===
As molten iron [[phase transition|cools down]], it solidifies at 1,538&amp;nbsp;°C (2,800&amp;nbsp;°F) into its δ allotrope, which has a [[body-centered cubic]] (BCC) [[crystal]] structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-first=Taylor |editor-last=Lyman  |series=Metals Handbook |volume=8 |title=Metallography, Structures and Phase Diagrams |year= 1973 |edition=8th |publisher=ASM International |location=Metals Park, Ohio |oclc=490375371}}&lt;/ref&gt; δ-iron can dissolve as much as 0.08% of carbon by mass at 1,475&amp;nbsp;°C.

===Gamma iron / Austenite(γ-Fe)===
{{main|Austenite}}
As the iron cools further to 1,394&amp;nbsp;°C its [[crystal structure]] changes to a [[face centered cubic]] (FCC) crystalline structure. In this form it is called gamma iron (γ-Fe) or [[Austenite]]. γ-iron can dissolve considerably more carbon (as much as 2.04% by mass at 1,146&amp;nbsp;°C). This γ form of carbon saturation is exhibited in [[stainless steel]].

===Beta iron (β-Fe)===
'''Beta iron''' (β-Fe) are [[Obsolescence|obsolete]] terms for the [[paramagnetic]] allotrope of iron.&lt;ref&gt;D. K. Bullens ''et al''., ''Steel and Its Heat Treatment, Vol. I, Fourth Ed.'', J. Wiley &amp; Sons Inc., 1938, p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=S.H. |last=Avner |title=Introduction to physical metallurgy |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZsBTAAAAMAAJ |year=1974 |publisher=McGraw-Hill |isbn=978-0-07-002499-1 |edition=2nd |page=225}}&lt;/ref&gt; The primary [[Phase (matter)|phase]] of low-carbon or [[mild steel]] and most [[cast iron]]s at room temperature is [[ferromagnetic]] α-Fe. As [[iron]] or [[steel]] is heated above the critical temperature '''A&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''' or [[Curie temperature]] of 771&amp;nbsp;°C (1044K or 1420&amp;nbsp;°F),&lt;ref name="ASM3"&gt;{{cite book |series=ASM Handbook |volume=3 |title=Alloy Phase Diagrams |publisher=ASM International |year=1992 |pages=2.210, 4.9 |isbn=0-87170-381-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; the random thermal agitation of the atoms exceeds the oriented magnetic moment of the [[unpaired electron]] spins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=B.D. |last=Cullity |first2=C.D. |last2=Graham |title=Introduction to Magnetic Materials |edition=2nd |publisher=IEEE |year=2009 |page=91 |isbn=978-0-471-47741-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The A&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; forms the low-temperature boundary of the beta iron field in the [[phase diagram]] in Figure 1. β-Fe is [[Crystallography|crystallographically]] identical to α-Fe, except for [[magnetic domain]]s and the expanded [[body-centered cubic]] lattice parameter as a function of temperature, and is therefore of only minor importance in steel [[heat treating]]. For this reason, the beta "phase" is not usually considered a distinct phase but merely the high-temperature end of the alpha phase field.

Similarly, the A&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is of only minor importance compared to the A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ([[eutectoid]]), A&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and A&lt;sub&gt;cm&lt;/sub&gt; critical temperatures. The A&lt;sub&gt;cm&lt;/sub&gt;, where [[austenite]] is in equilibrium with [[cementite]] + γ-Fe, is beyond the right edge in Fig. 1. The α + γ phase field is, technically, the β + γ field above the A&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. The beta designation maintains continuity of the Greek-letter progression of phases in iron and steel: α-Fe, β-Fe, [[austenite]] (γ-Fe), high-temperature δ-Fe, and high-pressure [[hexaferrum]] (ε-Fe).

[[Image:Beta iron carbon pd.TIF|thumb|left|'''Figure 1:''' The beta field and A&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; critical temperature on the iron-rich side of the iron-carbon phase diagram.&lt;ref name="ASM3"/&gt;]]

===A&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; critical temperature and induction heating===
β-Fe and the A&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; critical temperature are important in [[induction heating]] of steel, such as for surface-hardening heat treatments. Steel is typically austenitized at 900–1000&amp;nbsp;°C before it is [[Quenching|quenched]] and [[tempering (metallurgy)|tempered]]. The high-frequency alternating magnetic field of induction heating heats the steel by two mechanisms below the Curie temperature: resistance or Joule (I&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;R) heating and ferromagnetic [[Hysteresis#In materials|hysteresis]] losses. Above the A&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, the hysteresis mechanism disappears and the required amount of energy per degree of temperature increase is substantially larger than below A&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Load-matching circuits may be needed to vary the [[Electrical impedance|impedance]] in the induction power source to compensate for the change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=S.L. |last=Semiatin |first2=D.E. |last2=Stutz |title=Induction Heat Treatment of Steel |publisher=ASM International |year=1986 |pages=95–98 |isbn=0-87170-211-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alpha iron (α-Fe)===
Below 912&amp;nbsp;°C (1,674&amp;nbsp;°F) iron again adopts the BCC structure characteristic of α-iron, also called '''ferrite'''. The substance assumes a [[paramagnetic]] property. Carbon dissolves poorly in α-iron: no more than 0.021% by mass at 723&amp;nbsp;°C.

As it cools to 770&amp;nbsp;°C (1,418&amp;nbsp;°F), the [[Curie point]] (T&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;), the iron is a fairly soft metal and becomes [[Ferromagnetism|ferromagnetic]]. As iron passes below the Curie temperature, no structural change occurs, but the [[magnet]]ic properties as the [[magnetic domains]] become aligned. This form of iron is stable form at room [[temperature]].  α-Fe can be subjected to pressures up to ca. 15 GPa before transforming into a high-pressure form termed [[Hexaferrum|ε-iron]], which crystallizes in a [[hexagonal close-packed]] (hcp) structure.

α-Fe is a component of [[steel]] and [[cast iron]], conferring [[Ferromagnetism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Maranian | first = Peter | title = Reducing Brittle and Fatigue Failures in Steel Structures | publisher = American Society of Civil Engineers | location = New York | year = 2009 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=qTT2LgLnpMUC&amp;pg=PA81 | isbn = 978-0-7844-1067-7 | postscript =.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It has a hardness of approximately 80 [[Brinell scale|Brinell]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Structure of plain steel | url = http://www.keytometals.com/page.aspx?ID=CheckArticle&amp;site=kts&amp;NM=3 | accessdate = 2008-10-21}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Alvarenga&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Alvarenga HD, Van de Putte T, Van Steenberge N, Sietsma J, Terryn H |title=Influence of Carbide Morphology and Microstructure on the Kinetics of Superficial Decarburization of C-Mn Steels |journal=Metal Mater Trans A. |date=January 2015 |volume=46 |issue=1 |pages=123–133 |doi=10.1007/s11661-014-2600-y |bibcode=2015MMTA...46..123A }}&lt;/ref&gt; the maximum [[solubility]] is about 0.02 wt% at {{convert|727|C}} and 0.001% carbon at {{convert|0|C}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|Hashemi|2006|p=363}}.&lt;/ref&gt; When it dissolves in iron, carbon atoms occupy interstitial "holes".  Being about twice the diameter of the [[tetrahedral hole]], the carbon introduces a strong local strain field.

[[Mild steel]] (carbon steel with up to about 0.2 wt% C) consist mostly of α-Fe and increasing amounts of [[cementite]] (Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C, an iron carbide).  The mixture adopts a laminar structure called [[pearlite]]. Since [[bainite]] and pearlite each contain α-Fe as a component, any iron-carbon alloy will contain some amount of α-Fe if it is allowed to reach [[chemical equilibrium|equilibrium]] at room temperature. The amount of α-Fe depends on the cooling process.

===Epsilon iron / Hexaferrum (ε-Fe)===
{{main|Hexaferrum}}
At pressures above approximately 10 GPa and temperatures of a few hundred kelvin or less, α-iron changes into a [[hexagonal close-packed]] (hcp) structure, which is also known as ε-iron or hexaferrum;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

===Experimental high temperature and pressure===

An alternate stable form, if it exists, may appear at pressures of at least 50 GPa and temperatures of at least 1,500 K; it has been thought to have an [[orthorhombic]] or a double hcp structure.&lt;ref name="HTP-iron"/&gt; as of December 2011, recent and ongoing experiments are being conducted on high-pressure and [[Superdense carbon allotropes]].

'''''Anamirta cocculus''''' ({{lang-mr|काकमारी}}) is a [[Southeast Asia]]n and Indian [[climbing plant]]. Its [[fruit]] is the source of [[picrotoxin]], a [[poison]]ous compound with stimulant properties.

The plant is large-stemmed (up to 10&amp;nbsp;cm in diameter); the bark is "corky gray" with white wood.  The "small, yellowish-white, sweet-scented" flowers vary between 6 and 10 centimeters across; the fruit produced is a [[drupe]], "about 1 cm in diameter when dry".&lt;ref name="RISE" /&gt;

The name "fishberry" comes from the use of the dried fruit as a method of [[fishing]], in which the fish is "stupified and captured"; this method, however, is considered "unsportsmanlike".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A Manual of Organic Materia Medica and Pharmacognosy |edition=3rd |author1=Lucius E.

The mission of '''Arizona Native Plant Society''' (AZNPS) is to promote knowledge, appreciation, conservation and restoration of Arizona native plants and their habitats, as well as the use of native plants in urban landscapes and gardens. Among its initiatives are the Plant Atlas Project of Arizona (PAPAZ), which trains AZNPS volunteers in botanical fieldwork; publication of booklets and brochures promoting the use of native plants; compilation and web publication of plant lists for various natural areas of Arizona and northern Mexico; grants for publication assistance and research; and pioneering work in invasive species education and removal.

AZNPS began in 1977, when more than a dozen nursery owners, landscapers, and professionals created a non-profit society dedicated to educating Arizonans about the state's native plants, as well as other [[xeric]] landscape plants, including many new horticultural imports. Early on, AZNPS published a series of eight landscaping booklets designed to educate the public about the use of native and xeric plants in desert landscapes. 

About the year 2000, AZNPS began to promote the total use of native plants in the landscape, as native plants are best adapted to local habitats and soils, use the least amount of water, and are easier to maintain and keep disease-free than are imported plants. They also provide an extension of native habitat into the urban area as a [[habitat corridor|"corridor"]] for native pollinators and other wildlife. 

AZNPS currently has five chapters that hold monthly seasonal meetings, field trips, workshops and special presentations, staff tables at local events, and network with other nongovernmental organizations and government agencies in restoration and invasive species work. The organization has two publications: The Plant Press, published biannually in themed issues offering in-depth articles on a topic, and Happenings, a quarterly listing of local chapter and state news.

The '''Auckland Gas Company''' is a company providing [[Liquefied petroleum gas|gas]] for residential or commercial customers in the [[Auckland]] area, [[New Zealand]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}} It is one of the oldest still existing [[brand|brand names]] in New Zealand, having been established as Auckland Gas Company Ltd in 1862 or 1863.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aucklandgas.co.nz/why-agc/ Why The Auckland Gas Company?] (from the official company website.

== History ==

The Auckland Gas Company was formed in 1862 as the first [[joint stock company]] in New Zealand. It was also the first private services provider in Auckland. In the 1870s, the company bought and developed a large site in [[Freemans Bay]] to build a [[gasworks]] (roughly on and east of the site of the current [[New World (supermarket)|New World]] supermarket), with further buildings (mainly workshops) and offices on Beaumont Street.&lt;ref name="TRAN"&gt;[http://cmi.transit.govt.nz/resources/vpt/Notice%20of%20Req/Volume%203/Appendix-16-Heritage.pdf Auckland Gas Company Offices and Workshops Buildings] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080411172558/http://cmi.transit.govt.nz/resources/vpt/Notice%20of%20Req/Volume%203/Appendix-16-Heritage.pdf |date=April 11, 2008 }} (from the Addendum 2 February 2006 of the [[Victoria Park Viaduct|Vic Park Tunnel]] project documentation, [[Transit New Zealand]], Page 13. Accessed 2008-02-20.)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1960s the [[Kapuni]] gas fields were opened, providing [[natural gas]] which was cleaner and cheaper than the locally produced [[coal gas]] variant, and the company stopped producing gas and became a supplier only. This led to most of the buildings in the Freemans Bay are being demolished.&lt;ref name="TRAN"/&gt;

[[File:BlueMotion badge.jpg|thumb|The BlueMotion Badge]]
'''BlueMotion''' is a tradename for certain [[car]] models from the [[Volkswagen Group]] with an emphasis on higher fuel efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Case Studies - Volkswagen AG|url=http://www.originbranding.com/portfolio-item/volkswagon-bluemotion/|format=PDF|work=Origin Brand Consultants - Case Studies|publisher=OriginBranding.com|date= |accessdate=2009-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ANW-AW&gt;{{cite web|title=Lean and Green: Volkswagen adding fuel-efficient BlueMotion versions to volume car lines|url=http://autoweek.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060404/FREE/60403015/1024/LATESTNEWS|work=Automotive News Europe|publisher=AutoWeek.com|date=3 April 2006|accessdate=26 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Volkswagen]] introduced the name in 2006 on the [[Volkswagen Polo Mk4|Mk4 Polo]] BlueMotion,&lt;ref name=ANW-AW/&gt;&lt;ref name=AE&gt;{{cite web|title=Volkswagen Polo BlueMotion - Volkswagen has given the green light to UK sales of its new Polo BlueMotion|url=http://www.autoexpress.co.uk/news/autoexpressnews/204422/volkswagen_polo.html|work=[[Auto Express]]|publisher=[[Dennis Publishing Limited]]|date=1 January 2007|accessdate=26 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2007 a version based on the current [[Volkswagen Passat#B6|Passat]] was released. More recently, the technology has been used in [[SEAT]]'s models like the [[SEAT Ibiza]] or the [[SEAT León]] under the name 'EcoMotive,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New SEAT EcoMotive range|url=http://www.seat.com/static/su/com/SEAT/site/2009/ecomotive/downloads/PDF/Range_Leaflet_Ecomotive.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091229125400/http://www.seat.com/static/su/com/SEAT/site/2009/ecomotive/downloads/PDF/Range_Leaflet_Ecomotive.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=29 December 2009|format=PDF|work=[[SEAT|SEAT S.A.]]|publisher=SEAT.com|date=1 September 2009|accessdate=26 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in the [[Škoda Auto|Škoda]] [[Škoda Fabia|Fabia]] and [[Škoda Superb|Superb]], where the technology is called "GreenLine". BlueMotion versions of the [[Volkswagen Golf Mk5|Golf Mk5]] and [[Volkswagen Touran|Touran]] were released in 2008. The name refers to Volkswagen Group's corporate colour, blue, with the word 'motion' added to denote mobility,&lt;ref name=ANW-AW/&gt; and echoes [[DaimlerChrysler]]'s [[BlueTec]] engines which are equipped with advanced NOx reducing technology for diesel-powered vehicle emissions control.

The BlueMotion Polo (based on the Mk4 Polo) and Ibiza Ecomotive used a special [[list of Volkswagen Group diesel engines#1.4 TDI 51-66kW|1.4 L three cylinder]] [[Turbocharged Direct Injection]] (TDI) [[diesel engine]]&lt;ref name=AE/&gt; which develops {{convert|59|kW|PS bhp|lk=on|abbr=on}} achieves {{convert|3.9|L/100 km|abbr=on}}&lt;ref name=ANW-AW/&gt;&lt;ref name=AE/&gt; while producing just 99&amp;nbsp;grammes of [[carbon dioxide|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] per kilometre (base model), or 102&amp;nbsp;g/km with the higher specification trim package (with air conditioning, etc.).&lt;ref name=AE/&gt; The Ibiza was subsequently changed to the [[list of Volkswagen Group diesel engines#1.2_R3_12v_TDI_55kW|1.2 L TDI engine]].

The BlueMotion [[Volkswagen Golf Mk6|Golf Mk6]] uses a new [[list of Volkswagen Group diesel engines#1.6 TDI CR 16v 55-85kW|1.6 L TDI engine]], and [[Volkswagen Polo Mk5|Polo Mk5]] uses a new [[list of Volkswagen Group diesel engines#1.2_R3_12v_TDI_55kW|1.2 L TDI engine]], which produces 87 to 90&amp;nbsp;g/km of {{CO2}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=English|first=Andrew|title=Volkswagen Polo BlueMotion Review|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/motoring/car-manufacturers/volkswagen/7241823/Volkswagen-Polo-BlueMotion-review.html|work=Daily Telegraph, web edition, 22 February 2010|publisher=Telegraph Media Group Ltd|accessdate=29 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fuel economy==
The cars combine a fuel efficient engine with fuel efficient design and technological strategies that include a more aerodynamic body, a low ride height, auto stop-start, programmed battery charging system (so the alternator only runs when necessary), longer gearing and low rolling resistance tires. On 30 June 2011 a Volkswagen Passat 1.6 TDI BlueMotion set a world record for the greatest distance driven on a single tank of fuel, recognized by the ''Guinness Book of Records'', achieving {{convert|1,526.63|mi|km}}. The average consumption amounted to {{convert|74.8|mpgus}}.&lt;ref&gt;Guinness World Records, [http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/longest-fuel-range-(standard) "Greatest distance driven on a single tank of fuel"], 30 June 2011. Retrieved 21 May 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; BlueMotion vehicles are not available in North America.

==BlueMotion strategy==
BlueMotionTechnologies include all products, basic technologies and innovations that significantly improve fuel economy and reduce emissions. These basic technologies represent the foundations of BlueMotion. Currently, they cover the TDI (turbocharged diesel direct injection) and TSI (boosted petrol stratified direct injection) engines as well as the extremely efficient Direct Shift Gearbox (DSG). They are supplemented by technological innovations that include drive variants such as EcoFuel (natural gas
engines), BiFuel (liquid natural gas engines), MultiFuel (ethanol engines), hybrid systems and electric drives, as well as NOx emissions control, [[regenerative braking]] and the Stop-Start system. These basic technologies and innovations are getting incorporated into a growing range of products. These products / vehicles are currently grouped at Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles into three concept brands: ‘BlueMotion’, ‘BlueMotion Technology’ and ‘BlueTDI’.&lt;ref name="vwphaetonfan.blogspot.com.au"&gt;http://vwphaetonfan.blogspot.com.au/2010/10/volkswagen-commercial-vehicles-unveils.html{{dubious|date=January 2013|reason=Not a reliable source}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The BlueMotion brands represents the most fuel efficient model of its line and has the following:

;Engine: Revised engine mapping, [[diesel particulate filter]]s and oxidising [[catalytic converter]]s&lt;ref name=AE/&gt; help the fuel consumption and lower [[NOx]] levels. In the more modern incarnations there's also a start-stop system that halts and restarts the motor at brief stops.
;Transmission: The last two gear ratios are longer than on standard [[Turbocharged Direct Injection|TDI]] engine gearboxes.&lt;ref name=ANW-AW/&gt;&lt;ref name=AE/&gt;
;Reduced rolling resistance: Low-resistance tires and better aerodynamics through lowered [[suspension (vehicle)|suspension]], redesigned [[spoiler (automotive)|spoilers]] and additional enhancements underneath each car so the air is better channelled giving less [[drag (aerodynamics)|drag]] which produces better fuel economy.&lt;ref name=ANW-AW/&gt;&lt;ref name=AE/&gt;

===BlueMotion Technology===
Volkswagen offers BlueMotion Technology packages over the whole range and it can be configured with TSI and TDI engines.
The package includes [[start-stop system]], change gear indicator and [[regenerative braking]] technology.&lt;ref name="vwphaetonfan.blogspot.com.au" /&gt; The 2015 Golf GTI (mark VII) is available in BlueMotion version.

===In Brazil===
Currently BlueMotion in Brazil focuses on reduced rolling resistance and taller gearbox ratios, among other changes.

The Polo Bluemotion, the first model with the BlueMotion label in Brazil, uses the 1.6 TotalFlex (gasoline/alcohol) engine which is found in the other models. In April 2012 VW introduced in Brazil the Fox Bluemotion with the same engine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.volkswagen.com/br/pt/carros/polo.html Polo &gt; Volkswagen Brazil] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629212611/http://www.volkswagen.com/br/pt/carros/polo.html |date=29 June 2011 }} (in Portuguese)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles===
[[Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles]] offer a Multivan, Transporter and Crafter BlueMotion and BlueMotion Technology packages across the whole range.&lt;ref name="vwphaetonfan.blogspot.com.au"/&gt;

The basic physical idea behind bosonization is that [[Dirac sea|particle-hole excitations]] are bosonic in character. However, it was shown by [[Sin-Itiro Tomonaga|Tomonaga]] in 1950 that this principle is only valid in one-dimensional systems.&lt;ref name=senechal&gt;{{Cite book|last=Sénéchal|first=David|title=An Introduction to Bosonization|journal=Theoretical Methods for Strongly Correlated Electrons|pages=139–186|year=1999|series=CRM Series in Mathematical Physics|doi=10.1007/0-387-21717-7_4|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/q8p7094320733111/|arxiv=cond-mat/9908262|bibcode=2004tmsc.book..139S|isbn=978-0-387-00895-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bosonization is an [[effective field theory]] that focuses on low-energy excitations.&lt;ref name=glazman&gt;{{cite book|last=Sohn|first=Lydia (ed.)|title=Mesoscopic electron transport|pages=cond–mat/9610037|year=1997|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-0-7923-4737-8|arxiv=cond-mat/9610037|bibcode = 1996cond.mat.10037F }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This is done for [[Luttinger liquid|Luttinger liquid theory]].

Two complex fermions &lt;math&gt;\psi,\bar\psi&lt;/math&gt; are written as functions of a boson &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;

while the inverse map is given by
:&lt;math&gt;\partial\phi=:\bar\psi\psi:&lt;/math&gt;
All equations are [[normal-order]]ed. The changed statistics arises from [[anomalous dimension]]s of the fields.

&lt;/ref&gt; Given that vapor will probably have a different composition than the liquid, the bubble point (along with the [[dew point]]) at different compositions are useful data when designing distillation systems.&lt;ref name="Perry"&gt;{{cite book|editor=Perry, R.H.|editor2=Green, D.W.|title=[[Perry's Chemical Engineers' Handbook]]|edition=7th|publisher=McGraw-hill|date=1997|isbn=0-07-049841-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For a single component the bubble point and the dew point are the same and are referred to as the [[boiling point]].

==Calculating the bubble point==
At the bubble point, the following relationship holds:&lt;br&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=1}^{N_c} y_i = \sum_{i=1}^{N_c} K_i x_i = 1&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
where&lt;br&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;K_i \equiv \frac{y_{ie}}{x_{ie}}&lt;/math&gt;.
K is the ''distribution coefficient'' or ''K factor'', defined as the ratio of mole fraction in the vapor phase &lt;math&gt;\big(y_{ie}\big)&lt;/math&gt; to the mole fraction in the liquid phase &lt;math&gt;\big(x_{ie}\big)&lt;/math&gt; at equilibrium.
&lt;br&gt;
When [[Raoult's law]] and [[Dalton's law]] hold for the mixture, the K factor is defined as the ratio of the vapor pressure to the total pressure of the system:&lt;ref name = "Unit Ops" /&gt;&lt;br&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;K_i = \frac{P'_i}{P}&lt;/math&gt;

Given either of &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;y_i&lt;/math&gt; and either the temperature or pressure of a two-component system, calculations can be performed to determine the unknown information.&lt;ref name = "Che Thermo2"&gt;

A '''bubble raft''' is an array of [[Bubble (physics)|bubbles]]. It demonstrates materials' [[microstructure|microstructural]] and atomic length-scale behavior by modelling the {111} plane of a close-packed crystal. A material's observable and measurable mechanical properties strongly depend on its atomic and microstructural configuration and characteristics. This fact is intentionally ignored in [[continuum mechanics]], which assumes a material to have no underlying microstructure and be uniform and semi-infinite throughout. 

Bubble rafts assemble bubbles on a water surface, often with the help of [[amphiphilic]] soaps. These assembled bubbles act like atoms, diffusing, slipping, ripening,  straining, and otherwise deforming in a way that models the behavior of the {111} plane of a close-packed crystal. The ideal (lowest energy) state of the assembly would undoubtedly be a perfectly regular single crystal, but just as in metals, the bubbles often form defects, grain boundaries, and multiple crystals. 

== History of bubble rafts ==
The concept of bubble raft modelling was first presented in 1947 by Nobel Laureate Sir [[William Lawrence Bragg]] and [[John Nye (scientist)|John Nye]] of [[Cambridge University]]'s [[Cavendish Laboratory]] in [[Proceedings of the Royal Society A]].[1] Legend claims that Bragg conceived of bubble raft models while pouring oil into his lawn mower. He noticed that bubbles on the surface of the oil assembled into rafts resembling the {111} plane of close-packed crystals[2]. Nye and Bragg later presented a method of generating and controlling bubbles on the surface of a glycerine-water-oleic acid-triethanolamine solution, in assemblies of 100,000 or more sub-millimeter sized bubbles. In their paper [1], they go on at length about the microstructural phenomena observed in bubble rafts and hypothesized in metals.

==Relation to crystal lattices==
In deforming a crystal lattice, one changes the energy and the [[interatomic potential]] felt by the atoms of the lattice. This [[interatomic potential]] is popularly (and mostly qualitatively) modeled using the [[Lennard-Jones potential]], which consists of a balance between attractive and repulsive forces between atoms.

The "atoms" in Bubble Rafts also exhibit such attractive and repulsive forces:

&lt;math&gt;U ( \rho ) = - \pi R^4 \rho_{solution} g 	\left ( \frac{\Beta}{\alpha} \right )^2 \mathit{A} K_0 (\alpha \rho) +

 \begin{cases} 0~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ \rho \ge \ 2 \\ \pi R^4 \rho_{solution} g \left ( \frac{(2-\rho)^2}{\alpha^2} \right ) ~~~ \rho \le\ 2 \end{cases}

&lt;/math&gt;     [2]

The portion of the equation to the left of the plus sign is the attractive force, and the portion to the right represents the repulsive force.

&lt;math&gt;U ( \rho )&lt;/math&gt; is the interbubble potential

&lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is the average bubble radius

&lt;math&gt;\rho_{solution}&lt;/math&gt; is the density of the solution from which the bubbles are formed

&lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; is the gravitational constant

&lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; is the ratio of the distance between bubbles to the bubble radius

&lt;math&gt;\Beta&lt;/math&gt; is the radius of ring contact

&lt;math&gt; \alpha&lt;/math&gt; is the ratio R/a of the bubble radius to the Laplace constant a, where

&lt;math&gt; a^2 = \frac {T}{\rho_{solution} g}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is the surface tension 

&lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is a constant dependent upon the boundary conditions of the calculation

&lt;math&gt;K_0&lt;/math&gt; is a zeroth-order modified [[Bessel function]] of the second kind[2]

Bubble rafts can display numerous phenomena seen in the crystal lattice. This includes such things as point [[Crystallographic defect|defect]]s (vacancies, substitutional impurities, interstitial atoms), edge [[dislocations]] and [[Crystallite|grains]]. A [[screw dislocation]] can't be modeled in a 2D bubble raft because it extends outside the plane. It is even possible to replicate some microstructure treats such as [[annealing (metallurgy)|annealing]]. The annealing process is simulated by stirring the bubble raft. This anneals out the dislocations ([[recovery (metallurgy)|recovery]]) and promotes [[recrystallization (metallurgy)|recrystallization]].

==History==

In February 1995, the Ministry for Energy was transformed into the state company Abkhazenergo. The company's first Chairman was Khuta Jinjolia, who had previously been Minister for Energy. In June of the same year, it was renamed to Chernomorenergo and turned into a state-owned private company.&lt;ref name=ci&gt;{{cite web|title=О компании|url=http://chernomorenergo.info/ru/company/istoriya/|publisher=Chernomorenergo|accessdate=10 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12095">In [[algebraic geometry]], a '''derived scheme''' is a pair &lt;math&gt;(X, \mathcal{O})&lt;/math&gt; consisting of a [[topological space]] ''X'' and a [[sheaf of spectra|sheaf]] &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{O}&lt;/math&gt; of [[commutative ring spectrum|commutative ring spectra]] &lt;ref&gt;also often called &lt;math&gt;E_\infty&lt;/math&gt;-ring spectra&lt;/ref&gt; on ''X'' such that (1) the pair &lt;math&gt;(X, \pi_0 \mathcal{O})&lt;/math&gt; is a [[scheme (mathematics)|scheme]] and (2) &lt;math&gt;\pi_k \mathcal{O}&lt;/math&gt; is a [[quasi-coherent sheaf|quasi-coherent]] &lt;math&gt;\pi_0 \mathcal{O}&lt;/math&gt;-[[module (mathematics)|module]]. The notion gives a [[homotopy]]-theoretic generalization of a scheme.

A [[derived stack]] is a stacky generalization of a derived scheme.

==Differential graded scheme==
Over a field of characteristic zero, the theory is equivalent to that of a differential graded scheme. By definition, a '''differential graded scheme''' is obtained by gluing affine differential graded schemes, with respect to [[étale topology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Differential Graded Schemes I: Perfect Resolving Algebras|journal =  |arxiv = math/0212225|date = 2002-12-16|first = Kai|last = Behrend|bibcode = 2002math.....12225B}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was introduced by [[Maxim Kontsevich]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite arxiv |title = Enumeration of rational curves via torus actions |arxiv = hep-th/9405035|date = 1994-05-05|first = M.|last = Kontsevich}}&lt;/ref&gt; "as the first approach to derived algebraic geometry."&lt;ref&gt;http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/dg-scheme&lt;/ref&gt; and was developed further by Mikhail Kapranov and Ionut Ciocan-Fontanine.

===Connection with differential graded rings and examples===
Just as [[Affine space|affine]] algebraic geometry is equivalent (in [[Category theory|categorical sense]]) to the theory of [[commutative ring]]s (commonly called [[commutative algebra]]), affine [[derived algebraic geometry]] over characteristic zero is equivalent to the theory of [[differential graded algebra|commutative differential graded rings]]. One of the main example of derived schemes comes from the derived intersection of subschemes of a scheme, giving the [[Koszul complex]]. For example, let &lt;math&gt;f_1, \ldots, f_k \in \mathbb{C}[x_1,\ldots, x_n] = R&lt;/math&gt;, then we can get a derived scheme &lt;math&gt;(X,\mathcal{O}_\bullet) = \mathbf{RSpec}(R/(f_1) \otimes_R^\mathbf{L} \cdots \otimes_R^\mathbf{L} R/(f_k))&lt;/math&gt; where
:&lt;math&gt;\textbf{RSpec}:(\textbf{dga}_\mathbb{C})^{op} \to \textbf{DerSch}&lt;/math&gt;
is the [[étale spectrum]].{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} Since we can construct a resolution
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{matrix}
0 \to &amp; R &amp; \xrightarrow{\cdot f_i} &amp; R &amp;\to 0 \\
&amp;\downarrow&amp;&amp;\downarrow&amp; \\
0\to &amp;0&amp; \to&amp;R/(f_i) &amp; \to 0
\end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;
the [[derived tensor product|derived ring]] &lt;math&gt;R/(f_1) \otimes_R^\mathbf{L} \cdots \otimes_R^\mathbf{L} R/(f_k)&lt;/math&gt; is the koszul complex &lt;math&gt;K_R(f_1,\ldots, f_k)&lt;/math&gt;. The truncation of this derived scheme to amplitude &lt;math&gt;[-1,0]&lt;/math&gt; provides a classical model motivating derived algebraic geometry. Notice that if we have a projective scheme
:&lt;math&gt;
\text{Proj}\left( \frac{\mathbb{Z}[x_0,\ldots,x_n]}{(f_1,\ldots, f_k)} \right)
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\text{deg}(f_i) = d_i&lt;/math&gt; we can construct the derived scheme &lt;math&gt;(\mathbb{P}^n, \mathcal{E}^\bullet,(f_1,\ldots, f_k))&lt;/math&gt; where
:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{E}^\bullet = [\mathcal{O}(-d_1)\oplus\cdots\oplus\mathcal{O}(-d_k) \xrightarrow{(\cdot f_1,\ldots,\cdot f_k)} \mathcal{O}]&lt;/math&gt;
with amplitude &lt;math&gt;[-1,0]&lt;/math&gt;

==Cotangent Complex==
&lt;!-- Cite manetti for this section, also, are there any universal properties the cotangent complex satisfies? --&gt;

=== Construction ===
Let &lt;math&gt;(A_\bullet,d)&lt;/math&gt; be a fixed differential graded algebra defined over a field of characteristic &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;. Then a &lt;math&gt;A_\bullet&lt;/math&gt;-differential graded algebra &lt;math&gt;(R_\bullet,d_R)&lt;/math&gt; is called '''semi-free''' if the following conditions hold:
# The underlying graded algebra &lt;math&gt;R_\bullet&lt;/math&gt; is a polynomial algebra over &lt;math&gt;A_\bullet&lt;/math&gt;, meaning it is isomorphic to &lt;math&gt;A_\bullet[\{x_i \}_{i \in I}]&lt;/math&gt;
# There exists a filtration &lt;math&gt;\varnothing = I_0 \subseteq I_1 \subseteq \cdots&lt;/math&gt; on the indexing set &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\cup_{n \in \mathbb{N}} I_n = I&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;s(x_i) \in A_\bullet[\{x_j\}_{j \in I_n}]&lt;/math&gt; for any &lt;math&gt;x_i \in I_{n+1}&lt;/math&gt;.
It turns out that every &lt;math&gt;A_\bullet&lt;/math&gt; differential graded algebra admits a surjective quasi-isomorphism from a semi-free &lt;math&gt;(A_\bullet,d)&lt;/math&gt; differential graded algebra, called a semi-free resolution. These are unique up to homotopy equivalence in a suitable model category. The (relative) '''cotangent complex''' of an &lt;math&gt;(A_\bullet,d)&lt;/math&gt;-differential graded algebra &lt;math&gt;(B_\bullet, d_B)&lt;/math&gt; can be constructed using a semi-free resolution &lt;math&gt;(R_\bullet,d_R) \to (B_\bullet, d_B)&lt;/math&gt;: it is defined as
:&lt;math&gt;
\mathbb{L}_{B_\bullet/A_\bullet} := \Omega_{R_\bullet/A_\bullet}\otimes_{R_\bullet} B_\bullet
&lt;/math&gt;
Many examples can be constructed by taking the algebra &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; representing a variety over a field of characteristic 0, finding a presentation of &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; as a quotient of a polynomial algebra and taking the Koszul complex associated to this presentation. The Koszul complex acts as a semi-free resolution of the differential graded algebra &lt;math&gt;(B_\bullet,0)&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;B_\bullet&lt;/math&gt; is the graded algebra with the non-trivial graded piece in degree 0.

===Examples===
The cotangent complex of a hypersurface &lt;math&gt;X = \mathbb{V}(f) \subset \mathbb{A}^n_\mathbb{C}&lt;/math&gt; can easily be computed: since we have the dga &lt;math&gt;K_R(f)&lt;/math&gt; representing the '''derived enhancement''' of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, we can compute the cotangent complex as
:&lt;math&gt;0 \to R\cdot ds \xrightarrow{\Phi} \oplus_i R \cdot dx_i \to 0&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\Phi(gds) = g\cdot df&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; is the usual universal derivation. If we take a complete intersection, then the koszul complex
:&lt;math&gt;R^\bullet = \frac{\mathbb{C}[x_1,\ldots,x_n]}{(f_1)} \otimes^\mathbf{L}_{\mathbb{C}[x_1,\ldots,x_n]} \cdots \otimes^\mathbf{L}_{\mathbb{C}[x_1,\ldots,x_n]} \frac{\mathbb{C}[x_1,\ldots,x_n]}{(f_k)} &lt;/math&gt;
is quasi-isomorphic to the complex
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\mathbb{C}[x_1,\ldots,x_n]}{(f_1,\ldots,f_k)}[+0]&lt;/math&gt;
This implies we can construct the cotangent complex of the derived ring &lt;math&gt;R^\bullet&lt;/math&gt; as the tensor product of the cotangent complex above for each &lt;math&gt;f_i&lt;/math&gt;.

===Remarks===
Please note that the cotangent complex in the context of derived geometry differs from the cotangent complex of classical schemes. Namely, if there was a singularity in the hypersurface defined by &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; then the cotangent complex would have infinite amplitude. These observations provide motivation for the '''hidden smoothness''' philosophy of derived geometry since we are now working with a complex of finite length.

==Tangent Complexes==

===Polynomial Functions===
Given a polynomial function &lt;math&gt;f:\mathbb{A}^n \to \mathbb{A}^m&lt;/math&gt;, then consider the (homotopy) pullback diagram
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{matrix}
Z &amp; \to &amp; \mathbb{A}^n \\
\downarrow &amp; &amp; \downarrow f \\
\{ pt \} &amp; \xrightarrow{0} &amp; \mathbb{A}^m
\end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;
where the bottom arrow is the inclusion of a point at the origin. Then, the derived scheme &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt; has tangent complex at &lt;math&gt;x\in Z&lt;/math&gt; is given by the morphism
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{T}_x = T_x\mathbb{A}^n \xrightarrow{df_x} T_0\mathbb{A}^m&lt;/math&gt;
where the complex is of amplitude &lt;math&gt;[-1,0]&lt;/math&gt;. Notice that the tangent space can be recovered using &lt;math&gt;H^0&lt;/math&gt; and the &lt;math&gt;H^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; measures how far away &lt;math&gt;x \in Z&lt;/math&gt; is from being a smooth point.
&lt;!-- should discuss the L^\infty structure with explicit examples!. look at the top of page 9 --&gt;

===Stack Quotients===
Given a stack &lt;math&gt;[X/G]&lt;/math&gt; there is a nice description for the tangent complex:
:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{T}_x = \mathfrak{g}_x \to T_xX &lt;/math&gt;
If the morphism is not injective, the &lt;math&gt;H^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; measures again how singular the space is. In addition, the euler characteristic of this complex yields the correct (virtual) dimension of the quotient stack.
&lt;!-- should discuss the L^\infty structure... --&gt;
In particular, if we look at the moduli stack of principal &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;-bundles, then the tangent complex is just &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{g}[+1]&lt;/math&gt;.

==Derived Schemes in Complex Morse Theory==
Derived schemes can be used for analyzing topological properties of affine varieties. For example, consider a smooth affine variety &lt;math&gt;M \subset \mathbb{A}^n&lt;/math&gt;. If we take a regular function &lt;math&gt;f:M \to \mathbb{C}&lt;/math&gt; and consider the section of &lt;math&gt;\Omega_M&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\Gamma_{df}: M \to \Omega_M&lt;/math&gt; sending &lt;math&gt;x \mapsto (x,df(x))&lt;/math&gt;
Then, we can take the derived pullback diagram
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{matrix}
X &amp; \to &amp; M \\
\downarrow &amp; &amp; \downarrow 0 \\
M &amp; \xrightarrow{\Gamma_{df}} &amp; \Omega_M
\end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; is the zero section, constructing a '''derived critical locus''' of the regular function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;.

===Example===
Consider the affine variety
:&lt;math&gt;M = \text{Spec}\left( \mathbb{C}[x,y] \right)&lt;/math&gt;
and the regular function given by &lt;math&gt;f(x,y) = x^2 + y^3&lt;/math&gt;. Then,
:&lt;math&gt;\Gamma_{df}(a,b) = (a,b,2a,3b^2)&lt;/math&gt; 
where we treat the last two coordinates as &lt;math&gt;dx,dy&lt;/math&gt;. The derived critical locus is then the derived scheme
:&lt;math&gt;\textbf{RSpec}\left( \frac{\mathbb{C}[x,y,dx,dy]}{(dx,dy)} \otimes_{\mathbb{C}[x,y,dx,dy]}^{\mathbf{L}} \frac{\mathbb{C}[x,y,dx,dy]}{(2x - dx, 3y^2 - dy)} \right)&lt;/math&gt;
Note that since the left term in the derived intersection is a complete intersection, we can compute a complex representing the derived ring as
:&lt;math&gt;K_{dx,dy}^\bullet(\mathbb{C}[x,y,dx,dy])\otimes_{\mathbb{C}[x,y,dx,dy]} \frac{\mathbb{C}[x,y,dx,dy]}{(2 - dx, 3y^2 - dy)}&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;K_{dx,dy}^\bullet(\mathbb{C}[x,y,dx,dy])&lt;/math&gt; is the koszul complex.
&lt;!-- The previous computation gave the derived intersection of the cotangent bundle of the hypersurface with the zero section of the embedded space... --&gt;

==Derived Critical Locus==
Consider a smooth function &lt;math&gt;f:M \to \mathbb{C}&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is smooth. The derived enhancement of &lt;math&gt;\text{Crit}(f)&lt;/math&gt;, the '''derived critical locus''', is given by the differential graded scheme &lt;math&gt;(M,\mathcal{A}^\bullet, Q)&lt;/math&gt; where the underlying graded ring are the polyvector fields
:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}^{-i} = \wedge^i T_M&lt;/math&gt;
and the differential &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; is defined by contraction by &lt;math&gt;df&lt;/math&gt;.

===Example===
For example, if &lt;math&gt;f:\mathbb{C}^2 \to \mathbb{C}&lt;/math&gt; is given by &lt;math&gt;f(x,y) = x^2 + y^3&lt;/math&gt; we have the complex
:&lt;math&gt; R\cdot \partial x\wedge \partial y \xrightarrow{2xdx + 3y^2dy} R \cdot \partial x \oplus R \cdot \partial y \xrightarrow{2xdx + 3y^2dy} R&lt;/math&gt;
representing the derived enhancement of &lt;math&gt;\text{Crit}(f)&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Deuterium''' (or '''hydrogen-2''', symbol '''{{Element2|deuterium}}''' or '''{{SimpleNuclide2|hydrogen|2}}''', also known as '''heavy hydrogen''') is one of two [[Stable isotope ratio|stable isotopes]] of [[hydrogen]] (the other being [[Hydrogen-1|protium]], or hydrogen-1). The [[atomic nucleus|nucleus]] of deuterium, called a '''deuteron''', contains one [[proton]] and one [[neutron]], whereas the far more common protium has no neutron in the nucleus. Deuterium has a [[natural abundance]] in Earth's [[oceans]] of about one [[atom]] in {{val|6420}} of hydrogen. Thus deuterium accounts for approximately 0.0156% (or, on a mass basis, 0.0312%) of all the naturally occurring hydrogen in the oceans, while protium accounts for more than 99.98%. The abundance of deuterium changes slightly from one kind of natural water to another (see [[Vienna Standard Mean Ocean Water]]).

The deuterium isotope's name is formed from the Greek ''deuteros'', meaning "second", to denote the two particles composing the nucleus.&lt;ref name="diplogen"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/nchem.1273 |pmid=22354440 |author=O'Leary, Dan |title=The deeds to deuterium |journal=Nature Chemistry |volume=4 |issue=3 |page=236 |year=2012 |bibcode=2012NatCh...4..236O}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deuterium was discovered and named in 1931 by [[Harold Urey]]. When the neutron was discovered in 1932, this made the nuclear structure of deuterium obvious, and Urey won the Nobel Prize in 1934. Soon after deuterium's discovery, Urey and others produced samples of "[[heavy water]]" in which the deuterium content had been highly concentrated.

Deuterium is destroyed in the interiors of stars faster than it is produced. Other natural processes are thought to produce only an insignificant amount of deuterium. Nearly all deuterium found in nature was produced in the [[Big Bang]] 13.8 billion years ago, as the basic or primordial ratio of hydrogen-1 to deuterium (about 26 atoms of deuterium per million hydrogen atoms) has its origin from that time. This is the ratio found in the gas giant planets, such as Jupiter.&lt;ref name="diplogen" /&gt;&lt;ref name="nature2"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/nature10519 |journal=Nature |volume=478 |pages=218–220 |year=2011 |title=Ocean-like water in the Jupiter-family comet 103P/Hartley 2 |last1=Hartogh |first1=Paul |last2=Lis |first2=Dariusz C. |last3=Bockelée-Morvan |first3=Dominique |last4=De Val-Borro |first4=Miguel |last5=Biver |first5=Nicolas |last6=Küppers |first6=Michael |last7=Emprechtinger |first7=Martin |last8=Bergin |first8=Edwin A. |last9=Crovisier |first9=Jacques |displayauthors=8 |issue=7368 |pmid=21976024 |bibcode=2011Natur.478..218H}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hersant"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://iopscience.iop.org/0004-637X/554/1/391/pdf/0004-637X_554_1_391.pdf |quote=see fig. 7. for a review of D/H ratios in various astronomical objects |doi=10.1086/321355 |title=A Two‐dimensional Model for the Primordial Nebula Constrained by D/H Measurements in the Solar System: Implications for the Formation of Giant Planets |year=2001 |last1=Hersant |first1=Franck |last2=Gautier |first2=Daniel |last3=Hure |first3=Jean‐Marc |journal=The Astrophysical Journal |volume=554 |pages=391–407 |bibcode=2001ApJ...554..391H |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, other astronomical bodies are found to have different ratios of deuterium to hydrogen-1. This is thought to be a result of natural isotope separation processes that occur from solar heating of ices in comets. Like the water cycle in Earth's weather, such heating processes may enrich deuterium with respect to protium. The analysis of deuterium/protium ratios in comets found results very similar to the mean ratio in Earth's oceans (156 atoms of deuterium per million hydrogens). This reinforces theories that much of Earth's ocean water is of cometary origin.&lt;ref name="nature2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hersant" /&gt; &lt;!--News reports of Hubble measurements of "6 atoms of D per 10,000" in Jupiter are wrong; the correct figure is 6 parts D per 100,000 by weight, which is 30 parts per million atom-fraction, close to the Galileo result of 26 parts per million, atom-fraction--&gt; The deuterium/protium ratio of the comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, as measured by the [[Rosetta (spacecraft)|Rosetta space probe]], is about three times that of earth water. This figure is the highest yet measured in a comet.&lt;ref name="sciencemag.org"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1126/science.1261952 |journal=Science |year=2014 |title=67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, a Jupiter family comet with a high D/H ratio |last1=Altwegg |first1=K. |last2=Balsiger |first2=H. |last3=Bar-Nun |first3=A. |last4=Berthelier |first4=J.

Deuterium/protium ratios thus continue to be an active topic of research in both astronomy and climatology.

==Differences from common hydrogen (protium)==

===Chemical symbol===
[[File:Deuterium discharge tube.jpg|thumb|right|Deuterium discharge tube]]

Deuterium is frequently represented by the [[chemical symbol]] D. Since it is an isotope of [[hydrogen]] with [[mass number]] 2, it is also represented by {{SimpleNuclide2|Hydrogen|2}}. [[International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry|IUPAC]] allows both D and {{SimpleNuclide2|Hydrogen|2}}, although {{SimpleNuclide2|Hydrogen|2}} is preferred.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iupac.org/reports/provisional/abstract04/connelly_310804.html |title=&amp;sect; IR-3.3.2 Provisional Recommendations |work=Nomenclature of Inorganic Chemistry |publisher=Chemical Nomenclature and Structure Representation Division, [[IUPAC]] |accessdate=2007-10-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061027174015/http://www.iupac.org/reports/provisional/abstract04/connelly_310804.html |archivedate=27 October 2006 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; A distinct chemical symbol is used for convenience because of the isotope's common use in various scientific processes. Also, its large mass difference with [[hydrogen-1|protium]] (&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H) (deuterium has a mass of {{val|2.014102|ul=u}}, compared to the [[mean]] hydrogen [[atomic weight]] of {{val|1.007947|u=u}}, and protium's mass of {{val|1.007825|u=u}}) confers non-negligible chemical dissimilarities with protium-containing compounds, whereas the isotope weight ratios within other chemical elements are largely insignificant in this regard.

===Spectroscopy===
In [[quantum mechanics]] the energy levels of electrons in atoms depend on the [[reduced mass]] of the system of electron and nucleus. For the [[hydrogen atom]], the role of reduced mass is most simply seen in the [[Bohr model]] of the atom, where the reduced mass appears in a simple calculation of the [[Rydberg constant]] and Rydberg equation, but the reduced mass also appears in the [[Schrödinger equation]], and the [[Dirac equation]] for calculating atomic energy levels.

The reduced mass of the system in these equations is close to the mass of a single electron, but differs from it by a small amount about equal to the ratio of mass of the electron to the atomic nucleus. For hydrogen, this amount is about 1837/1836, or 1.000545, and for deuterium it is even smaller: 3671/3670, or 1.0002725. The energies of spectroscopic lines for deuterium and light hydrogen (hydrogen-1) therefore differ by the ratios of these two numbers, which is 1.000272. The wavelengths of all deuterium spectroscopic lines are shorter than the corresponding lines of light hydrogen, by a factor of 1.000272. In astronomical observation, this corresponds to a blue Doppler shift of 0.000272 times the speed of light, or 81.6&amp;nbsp;km/s.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Detection of deuterium Balmer lines in the Orion Nebula |journal = Astronomy and Astrophysics|volume = 354|pages = L79|last1=Hébrard |first1=G. |last2=Péquignot |first2=D. |last3=Vidal-Madjar |first3=A. |last4=Walsh |first4=J. R. |last5=Ferlet |first5=R. |date=7 Feb 2000|arxiv = astro-ph/0002141|bibcode = 2000A&amp;A...354L..79H}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The differences are much more pronounced in vibrational spectroscopy such as [[infrared spectroscopy]] and [[Raman spectroscopy]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www1.lsbu.ac.uk/water/vibrat.html Water Absorption Spectrum]. lsbu.ac.uk&lt;/ref&gt; and in rotational spectra such as [[microwave spectroscopy]] because the [[reduced mass]] of the deuterium is markedly higher than that of protium. In [[nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy]], deuterium has a very different [[nuclear magnetic resonance|NMR]] frequency (e.g. 61&amp;nbsp;MHz when protium is at 400&amp;nbsp;MHz) and is much less sensitive. Deuterated solvents are usually used in protium NMR to prevent the solvent from overlapping with the signal, although [[deuterium NMR]] on its own right is also possible.

===Big Bang nucleosynthesis===
{{Main|Big Bang nucleosynthesis}}
Deuterium is thought to have played an important role in setting the number and ratios of the elements that were formed in the Big Bang. Combining thermodynamics and the changes brought about by cosmic expansion, one can calculate the fraction of protons and neutrons based on the temperature at the point that the universe cooled enough to allow formation of nuclei. This calculation indicates seven protons for every neutron at the beginning of nucleogenesis, a ratio that would remain stable even after nucleogenesis was over. This fraction was in favor of protons initially, primarily because the lower mass of the proton favored their production. As the universe expanded, it cooled. [[Free neutron]]s and protons are less stable than helium nuclei, and the protons and neutrons had a strong energetic reason to form helium-4. However, forming helium-4 requires the intermediate step of forming deuterium.

Through much of the few minutes after the big bang during which nucleosynthesis could have occurred, the temperature was high enough that the mean energy per particle was greater than the binding energy of weakly bound deuterium; therefore any deuterium that was formed was immediately destroyed. This situation is known as the '''deuterium bottleneck'''. The bottleneck delayed formation of any helium-4 until the universe became cool enough to form deuterium (at about a temperature equivalent to 100 keV). At this point, there was a sudden burst of element formation (first deuterium, which immediately fused to helium). However, very shortly thereafter, at twenty minutes after the Big Bang, the universe became too cool for any further nuclear fusion and nucleosynthesis to occur. At this point, the elemental abundances were nearly fixed, with the only change as some of the [[radioactive]] products of big bang nucleosynthesis (such as [[tritium]]) decay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Weiss |first=Achim |title=Equilibrium and change: The physics behind Big Bang Nucleosynthesis |url=http://www.einstein-online.info/en/spotlights/BBN_phys/index.html |work=Einstein Online |accessdate=2007-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The deuterium bottleneck in the formation of helium, together with the lack of stable ways for helium to combine with hydrogen or with itself (there are no stable nuclei with mass numbers of five or eight) meant that an insignificant amount of carbon, or any elements heavier than carbon, formed in the Big Bang. These elements thus required formation in stars. At the same time, the failure of much nucleogenesis during the Big Bang ensured that there would be plenty of hydrogen in the later universe available to form long-lived stars, such as our Sun.

===Abundance===
Deuterium occurs in trace amounts naturally as deuterium [[gas]], written {{SimpleNuclide2|Hydrogen|2}}&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; or D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, but most natural occurrence in the [[universe]] is bonded with a typical {{SimpleNuclide2|Hydrogen|1}} atom, a gas called [[hydrogen deuteride]] (HD or {{SimpleNuclide2|Hydrogen|1}}{{SimpleNuclide2|Hydrogen|2}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author=IUPAC Commission on Nomenclature of Inorganic Chemistry |title=Names for Muonium and Hydrogen Atoms and their Ions |journal=[[Pure and Applied Chemistry]] |year=2001 |volume=73 |pages=377–380 |url=http://www.iupac.org/publications/pac/2001/pdf/7302x0377.pdf |format=PDF |doi=10.1351/pac200173020377 |issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The existence of deuterium on Earth, elsewhere in the [[solar system]] (as confirmed by planetary probes), and in the spectra of [[star]]s, is also an important datum in [[physical cosmology|cosmology]]. Gamma radiation from ordinary nuclear fusion dissociates deuterium into protons and neutrons, and there are no known natural processes other than the [[Big Bang nucleosynthesis]], which might have produced deuterium at anything close to its observed natural abundance (deuterium is produced by the rare [[cluster decay]], and occasional absorption of naturally occurring neutrons by light hydrogen, but these are trivial sources). There is thought to be little deuterium in the interior of the Sun and other stars, as at temperatures there [[nuclear fusion reaction]]s that consume deuterium happen much faster than the [[proton-proton reaction]] that creates deuterium. However, deuterium persists in the outer solar atmosphere at roughly the same concentration as in Jupiter, and this has probably been unchanged since the origin of the Solar System. The natural abundance of deuterium seems to be a very similar fraction of hydrogen, wherever hydrogen is found, unless there are obvious processes at work that concentrate it.

The existence of deuterium at a low but constant primordial fraction in all hydrogen is another one of the arguments in favor of the [[Big Bang]] theory over the [[Steady State theory]] of the universe. The observed ratios of hydrogen to helium to deuterium in the universe are difficult to explain except with a Big Bang model.

The abundance of deuterium in the atmosphere of [[Jupiter]] has been directly measured by the [[Galileo space probe]] as 26 atoms per million hydrogen atoms. ISO-SWS observations find 22 atoms per million hydrogen atoms in Jupiter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Lellouch, E |year=2001 |title=The deuterium abundance in Jupiter and Saturn from ISO-SWS observations |journal=[[Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics]] |volume=670 |pages=610–622 |doi=10.1051/0004-6361:20010259 |last2=Bézard |first2=B. |last3=Fouchet |first3=T. |last4=Feuchtgruber |first4=H. |last5=Encrenaz |first5=T. |last6=De Graauw |first6=T. |bibcode=2001A&amp;A...370..610L |issue=2 |url=http://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/pdf/2001/17/aa10609.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; and this abundance is thought to represent close to the primordial solar system ratio.&lt;ref name="Hersant" /&gt; This is about 17% of the terrestrial deuterium-to-hydrogen ratio of 156 deuterium atoms per million hydrogen atoms.&lt;!--News reports of Hubble measurements of "6 atoms of D per 10,000" in Jupiter are wrong; the correct figure is 6 parts D per 100,000 by weight, which is 30 parts per million atom-fraction, close to the Galileo result of 26 parts per million, atom-fraction--&gt;

Cometary bodies such as [[Comet Hale-Bopp]] and [[Halley's Comet]] have been measured to contain relatively more deuterium (about 200 atoms D per million hydrogens), ratios which are enriched with respect to the presumed protosolar nebula ratio, probably due to heating, and which are similar to the ratios found in Earth seawater. The recent measurement of deuterium amounts of 161 atoms D per million hydrogen in Comet [[103P/Hartley]] (a former [[Kuiper belt]] object), a ratio almost exactly that in Earth's oceans, emphasizes the theory that Earth's surface water may be largely comet-derived.&lt;ref name="nature2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hersant"/&gt; Most recently the deuterium/protium (D/H) ratio of [[67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko]] as measured by ''Rosetta'' is about three times that of Earth water, a figure that is high.&lt;ref name="sciencemag.org"/&gt; This has caused renewed interest in suggestions that Earth's water may be partly of asteroidal origin.

Deuterium has also observed to be concentrated over the mean solar abundance in other terrestrial planets, in particular Mars and Venus.

===Production===
{{main|Heavy water#Production}}
Deuterium is produced for industrial, scientific and military purposes, by starting with ordinary water—a small fraction of which is naturally-occurring [[heavy water]]—and then separating out the heavy water by the [[Girdler sulfide process]], distillation, or other methods.

In theory, deuterium for heavy water could be created in a nuclear reactor, but separation from ordinary water is the cheapest bulk production process.

The world's leading supplier of deuterium was [[Atomic Energy of Canada Limited]], in Canada, until 1997, when the last heavy water plant was shut down. Canada uses heavy water as a [[neutron moderator]] for the operation of the [[CANDU reactor]] design.

Another major producer of heavy water is India. All but one of India's atomic energy plants are pressurised heavy water plants, which use natural (i.e., not enriched) uranium. India has eight (seven are in operation) heavy water plants, six (five) based on D-H exchange in ammonia gas and two plants extract deuterium from natural water in a process that uses hydrogen sulphide gas at high pressure.

While India is self-sufficient in heavy water for its own use, India now also exports reactor-grade heavy water.

==Properties==

===Physical properties===

The physical properties of deuterium compounds can exhibit significant [[kinetic isotope effect]]s and other physical and chemical property differences from the hydrogen analogs. [[D2O|D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O]], for example, is more [[Viscosity|viscous]] than [[H2O|H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O]].&lt;ref&gt;{{RubberBible86th}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chemically, there are differences in bond energy and length for compounds of heavy hydrogen isotopes compared to normal hydrogen, which are larger than the isotopic differences in any other element. Bonds involving deuterium and [[tritium]] are somewhat stronger than the corresponding bonds in hydrogen, and these differences are enough to cause significant changes in biological reactions. Pharmaceutical firms are interested in the fact that deuterium is harder to remove from carbon than hydrogen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Halford |first=Bethany |title=The deuterium switcheroo |pages=32–36 |newspaper=[[Chemical &amp; Engineering News]] |publisher=[[American Chemical Society]] |date=4 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Deuterium can replace the normal hydrogen in water molecules to form heavy water (D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O), which is about 10.6% denser than normal water (so that ice made from it sinks in ordinary water). Heavy water is slightly toxic in [[eukaryotic]] animals, with 25% substitution of the body water causing cell division problems and sterility, and 50% substitution causing death by cytotoxic syndrome (bone marrow failure and gastrointestinal lining failure). [[Prokaryotic]] organisms, however, can survive and grow in pure heavy water, though they develop slowly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |pmid=10535697 |title=Pharmacological uses and perspectives of heavy water and deuterated compounds |journal=Can.

It is estimated that a {{convert|70|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}} person might drink {{convert|4.8|l|USgal|abbr=out}} of heavy water without serious consequences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=nQh7iGX1geIC&amp;pg=PA111 |isbn=978-1-4020-1314-0 |pages=111–112 |chapter=Physiological effect of heavy water |editor=Vertes, Attila |year=2003 |publisher=Kluwer |location=Dordrecht |title=Elements and isotopes: formation, transformation, distribution}}&lt;/ref&gt; Small doses of heavy water (a few grams in humans, containing an amount of deuterium comparable to that normally present in the body) are routinely used as harmless metabolic tracers in humans and animals.

===Quantum properties===
The deuteron has [[quantum spin|spin]] +1 ("triplet") and is thus a [[boson]]. The [[nuclear magnetic resonance|NMR]] frequency of deuterium is significantly different from common light hydrogen. [[Infrared spectroscopy]] also easily differentiates many deuterated compounds, due to the large difference in IR absorption frequency seen in the vibration of a chemical bond containing deuterium, versus light hydrogen. The two stable isotopes of hydrogen can also be distinguished by using [[mass spectrometry]].

The triplet deuteron nucleon is barely bound at E&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; = {{val|2.23|u=MeV}}, and none of the higher energy states are bound. The singlet deuteron is a virtual state, with a negative binding energy of {{val|p=~|60|u=keV}}. There is no such stable particle, but this virtual particle transiently exists during neutron-proton inelastic scattering, accounting for the unusually large neutron scattering cross-section of the proton.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110721213924/http://mightylib.mit.edu/Course%20Materials/22.101/Fall%202004/Notes/Part3.pdf Neutron-Proton Scattering].

===Nuclear properties (the deuteron)===

====Deuteron mass and radius====
{{main|Proton radius puzzle}}
The nucleus of deuterium is called a '''deuteron'''. It has a mass of {{val|2.013553212745|(40)|u=u}} (equal to 1875.612 928(12) MeV)&lt;ref&gt;[http://physics.nist.gov/cgi-bin/cuu/Value?mdu#mid deuteron mass in u]. Physics.nist.gov. Retrieved on 2016-01-07.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Spin and energy====

Deuterium is one of only five stable [[nuclide]]s with an odd number of protons and an odd number of neutrons. ({{SimpleNuclide2|Hydrogen|2}}, [[isotopes of lithium|{{SimpleNuclide2|Lithium|6}}]], [[isotopes of boron|{{SimpleNuclide2|Boron|10}}]], [[isotopes of nitrogen|{{SimpleNuclide2|Nitrogen|14}}]], [[isotopes of tantalum|{{SimpleNuclide2|Tantalum|180m}}]]; also, the long-lived radioactive nuclides [[Potassium-40|{{SimpleNuclide2|Potassium|40}}]], [[isotopes of vanadium|{{SimpleNuclide2|Vanadium|50}}]], [[isotopes of lanthanum|{{SimpleNuclide2|Lanthanum|138}}]], [[isotopes of lutetium|{{SimpleNuclide2|Lutetium|176}}]] occur naturally.) Most odd-odd nuclei are unstable with respect to [[beta decay]], because the decay products are even-even, and are therefore more strongly bound, due to [[Semi-empirical mass formula#Pairing term|nuclear pairing effects]]. Deuterium, however, benefits from having its proton and neutron coupled to a spin-1 state, which gives a stronger nuclear attraction; the corresponding spin-1 state does not exist in the two-neutron or two-proton system, due to the [[Pauli exclusion principle]] which would require one or the other identical particle with the same spin to have some other different quantum number, such as [[angular momentum operator|orbital angular momentum]]. But orbital angular momentum of either particle gives a lower [[binding energy]] for the system, primarily due to increasing distance of the particles in the steep gradient of the nuclear force. In both cases, this causes the [[diproton]] and [[dineutron]] nucleus to be [[unstable]].

The proton and neutron making up deuterium can be [[Dissociation (chemistry)|dissociated]] through [[neutral current]] interactions with [[neutrino]]s. The [[Cross section (physics)|cross section]] for this interaction is comparatively large, and deuterium was successfully used as a neutrino target in the [[Sudbury Neutrino Observatory]] experiment.

====Isospin singlet state of the deuteron====
Due to the similarity in mass and nuclear properties between the proton and neutron, they are sometimes considered as two symmetric types of the same object, a [[nucleon]]. While only the proton has an electric charge, this is often negligible due to the weakness of the [[electromagnetic interaction]] relative to the [[strong nuclear interaction]]. The symmetry relating the proton and neutron is known as [[isospin]] and denoted ''I'' (or sometimes ''T'').

Isospin is an [[SU(2)]] symmetry, like ordinary [[Spin (physics)|spin]], so is completely analogous to it. The proton and neutron form an [[spin doublet|isospin doublet]], with a [[Spin-½|"down" state]] (↓) being a neutron, and an [[Spin-½|"up" state]] (↑) being a proton.&lt;ref name=Kalm&gt;, "Deuteron States", ''Nessa Journal of Physics'', 2017, vol. 1, issue 2, pp. 1–17&lt;/ref&gt;

A pair of nucleons can either be in an antisymmetric state of isospin called [[Singlet state|singlet]], or in a symmetric state called [[Spin triplet|triplet]]. In terms of the "down" state and "up" state, the singlet is
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\Big( |\uparrow \downarrow \rangle - |\downarrow \uparrow \rangle\Big).&lt;/math&gt;

This is a nucleus with one proton and one neutron, i.e. a deuterium nucleus. The triplet is
:&lt;math&gt;
\left(
\begin{array}{ll}
|\uparrow\uparrow\rangle\\
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}( |\uparrow\downarrow\rangle + |\downarrow\uparrow\rangle )\\
|\downarrow\downarrow\rangle
\end{array}
\right)
&lt;/math&gt;
and thus consists of three types of nuclei, which are supposed to be symmetric: a deuterium nucleus (actually a highly [[excited state]] of it), a nucleus with two protons, and a nucleus with two neutrons. These states are not stable.

====Approximated wavefunction of the deuteron====
The deuteron wavefunction must be antisymmetric if the isospin representation is used (since a proton and a neutron are not identical particles, the wavefunction
need not be antisymmetric in general). Apart from their isospin, the two nucleons also have spin and spatial distributions of their wavefunction. The latter is symmetric if the deuteron is symmetric under [[Parity (physics)|parity]] (i.e. have an "even" or "positive" parity), and antisymmetric if the deuteron is antisymmetric under parity (i.e. have an "odd" or "negative" parity). The parity is fully determined by the total orbital angular momentum of the two nucleons: if it is even then the parity is even (positive), and if it is odd then the parity is odd (negative).

The deuteron, being an isospin singlet, is antisymmetric under nucleons exchange due to isospin, and therefore must be symmetric under the double exchange of their spin and location. Therefore, it can be in either of the following two different states:
*Symmetric spin and symmetric under parity. In this case, the exchange of the two nucleons will multiply the deuterium wavefunction by (−1) from isospin exchange, (+1) from spin exchange and (+1) from parity (location exchange), for a total of (−1) as needed for antisymmetry.
*Antisymmetric spin and antisymmetric under parity. In this case, the exchange of the two nucleons will multiply the deuterium wavefunction by (−1) from isospin exchange, (−1) from spin exchange and (−1) from parity (location exchange), again for a total of (−1) as needed for antisymmetry.

In the first case the deuteron is a spin triplet, so that its total spin ''s'' is 1. It also has an even parity and therefore even orbital angular momentum ''l'' ; The lower its orbital angular momentum, the lower its energy. Therefore, the lowest possible energy state has {{nowrap|''s'' {{=}} 1}}, {{nowrap|''l'' {{=}} 0}}.

In the second case the deuteron is a spin singlet, so that its total spin ''s'' is 0. It also has an odd parity and therefore odd orbital angular momentum ''l''. Therefore, the lowest possible energy state has {{nowrap|''s'' {{=}} 0}}, {{nowrap|''l'' {{=}} 1}}.

Since {{nowrap|''s'' {{=}} 1}} gives a stronger nuclear attraction, the deuterium [[ground state]] is in the {{nowrap|''s'' {{=}}1}}, {{nowrap|''l'' {{=}} 0}} state.

The same considerations lead to the possible states of an isospin triplet having {{nowrap|''s'' {{=}} 0}}, {{nowrap|''l'' {{=}} even}} or {{nowrap|''s'' {{=}} 1}}, {{nowrap|''l'' {{=}} odd}}. Thus the state of lowest energy has {{nowrap|''s'' {{=}} 1}}, {{nowrap|''l'' {{=}} 1}}, higher than that of the isospin singlet.

The analysis just given is in fact only approximate, both because isospin is not an exact symmetry, and more importantly because the [[strong nuclear interaction]] between the two nucleons is related to [[angular momentum]] in [[spin-orbit interaction]] that mixes different ''s'' and ''l'' states. That is, ''s'' and ''l'' are not constant in time (they do not [[commutativity|commute]] with the [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]]), and over time a state such as {{nowrap|''s'' {{=}} 1}}, {{nowrap|''l'' {{=}} 0}} may become a state of {{nowrap|''s'' {{=}} 1}}, {{nowrap|''l'' {{=}} 2}}. Parity is still constant in time so these do not mix with odd ''l'' states (such as {{nowrap|''s'' {{=}} 0}}, {{nowrap|''l'' {{=}} 1}}). Therefore, the [[quantum state]] of the deuterium is a [[Quantum superposition|superposition]] (a linear combination) of the {{nowrap|''s'' {{=}} 1}}, {{nowrap|''l'' {{=}} 0}} state and the {{nowrap|''s'' {{=}} 1}}, {{nowrap|''l'' {{=}} 2}} state, even though the first component is much bigger. Since the [[total angular momentum]] ''j'' is also a good [[quantum number]] (it is a constant in time), both components must have the same ''j'', and therefore {{nowrap|''j'' {{=}} 1}}. This is the total spin of the deuterium nucleus.

To summarize, the deuterium nucleus is antisymmetric in terms of isospin, and has spin 1 and even (+1) parity. The relative angular momentum of its nucleons ''l'' is not well defined, and the deuteron is a superposition of mostly {{nowrap|''l'' {{=}} 0}} with some {{nowrap|''l'' {{=}} 2}}.

====Magnetic and electric multipoles====
In order to find theoretically the deuterium [[magnetic dipole moment]] µ, one uses the formula for a [[nuclear magnetic moment]]
:&lt;math&gt;\mu = 
\frac{1}{j+1}\langle(l,s),j,m_j=j|\vec{\mu}\cdot \vec{\jmath} \, |(l,s),j,m_j=j\rangle&lt;/math&gt;
with
:&lt;math&gt;\vec{\mu} = g^{(l)}\vec{l} + g^{(s)}\vec{s} &lt;/math&gt;
g&lt;sup&gt;(l)&lt;/sup&gt; and g&lt;sup&gt;(s)&lt;/sup&gt; are [[g-factor (physics)|g-factor]]s of the nucleons.

Since the proton and neutron have different values for g&lt;sup&gt;(l)&lt;/sup&gt; and g&lt;sup&gt;(s)&lt;/sup&gt;, one must separate their contributions. Each gets half of the deuterium orbital angular momentum &lt;math&gt;\vec{l}&lt;/math&gt; and spin &lt;math&gt;\vec{s}&lt;/math&gt;. One arrives at

:&lt;math&gt;\mu = 
\frac{1}{j+1}\langle(l,s),j,m_j=j|\left(\frac{1}{2}\vec{l} {g^{(l)}}_p + \frac{1}{2}\vec{s} ({g^{(s)}}_p + {g^{(s)}}_n)\right)\cdot \vec{\jmath} \, |(l,s),j,m_j=j\rangle&lt;/math&gt;
where subscripts p and n stand for the proton and neutron, and {{nowrap|g&lt;sup&gt;(l)&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} 0}}.

By using the same identities as [[Nuclear magnetic moment#Calculating the magnetic moment|here]] and using the value {{nowrap|g&lt;sup&gt;(l)&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} {{val|1|ul=µN}}}}, we arrive at the following result, in nuclear magneton units
:&lt;math&gt;\mu = 
\frac{1}{4(j+1)}\left[({g^{(s)}}_p + {g^{(s)}}_n)\big(j(j+1) - l(l+1) + s(s+1)\big) + \big(j(j+1) + l(l+1) - s(s+1)\big)\right]&lt;/math&gt;

For the {{nowrap|''s'' {{=}} 1}}, {{nowrap|''l'' {{=}} 0}} state ({{nowrap|''j'' {{=}} 1}}), we obtain
:&lt;math&gt;\mu = \frac{1}{2}({g^{(s)}}_p + {g^{(s)}}_n) = 0.879&lt;/math&gt;

For the {{nowrap|''s'' {{=}} 1}}, {{nowrap|''l'' {{=}} 2}} state ({{nowrap|''j'' {{=}} 1}}), we obtain
:&lt;math&gt;\mu = -\frac{1}{4}({g^{(s)}}_p + {g^{(s)}}_n) + \frac{3}{4} = 0.310&lt;/math&gt;

The measured value of the deuterium [[magnetic dipole moment]], is {{val|0.857|u=µN}}, which is 97.5% of the {{val|0.879|u=µN}} value obtained by simply adding moments of the proton and neutron. This suggests that the state of the deuterium is indeed to a good approximation {{nowrap|''s'' {{=}} 1}}, {{nowrap|''l'' {{=}} 0}} state, which occurs with both nucleons spinning in the same direction, but their magnetic moments subtracting because of the neutron's negative moment.

But the slightly lower experimental number than that which results from simple addition of proton and (negative) neutron moments shows that deuterium is actually a linear combination of mostly {{nowrap|''s'' {{=}} 1}}, {{nowrap|''l'' {{=}} 0}} state with a slight admixture of {{nowrap|''s'' {{=}} 1}}, {{nowrap|''l'' {{=}} 2}} state.

The [[electric dipole]] is zero [[Nuclear shell model|as usual]].

The measured electric [[quadrupole]] of the deuterium is {{val|0.2859|u=[[elementary charge|e]]·[[femtometer|fm]]&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}. While the order of magnitude is reasonable, since the deuterium radius is of order of 1 femtometer (see below) and its [[electric charge]] is e, the above model does not suffice for its computation. More specifically, the [[electric quadrupole]] does not get a contribution from the ''l'' =0 state (which is the dominant one) and does get a contribution from a term mixing the ''l'' =0 and the ''l'' =2 states, because the electric quadrupole [[operator (quantum mechanics)|operator]] does not [[commutator (quantum mechanics)|commute]] with [[angular momentum]].

The latter contribution is dominant in the absence of a pure {{nowrap|''l'' {{=}} 0}} contribution, but cannot be calculated without knowing the exact spatial form of the nucleons [[wavefunction]] inside the deuterium.

Higher magnetic and electric [[multipole moment]]s cannot be calculated by the above model, for similar reasons.

==Applications==
Deuterium has a number of commercial and scientific uses. These include:

===Nuclear reactors===
[[File:Deuterium Ionized.JPG|thumb|right|Ionized deuterium in a [[fusor]] reactor giving off its characteristic pinkish-red glow]]
Deuterium is used in [[Heavy water reactor|heavy water moderated fission reactors]], usually as liquid D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, to slow neutrons without the high neutron absorption of ordinary hydrogen.&lt;ref&gt;See [[neutron cross section#Typical cross sections]]&lt;/ref&gt; This is a common commercial use for larger amounts of deuterium.

In [[research reactor]]s, liquid D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is used in [[cold source]]s to moderate neutrons to very low energies and wavelengths appropriate for [[neutron scattering|scattering experiments]].

Experimentally, deuterium is the most common nuclide used in [[nuclear fusion]] reactor designs, especially in combination with [[tritium]], because of the large reaction rate (or [[nuclear cross section]]) and high [[energy]] yield of the D–T reaction. There is an even higher-yield D–[[Helium-3|{{SimpleNuclide2|Helium|3}}]] fusion reaction, though the [[breakeven]] point of D–{{SimpleNuclide2|Helium|3}} is higher than that of most other fusion reactions; together with the scarcity of {{SimpleNuclide2|Helium|3}}, this makes it implausible as a practical power source until at least D–T and D–D fusion reactions have been performed on a commercial scale. However, commercial nuclear fusion is not yet an accomplished technology.

===NMR spectroscopy===
{{See also|Proton NMR|Deuterium NMR}}
[[File:Deuterium lamp 1.png|thumb|right|Emission spectrum of an ultraviolet [[deuterium arc lamp]]]]
Deuterium is most commonly used in hydrogen [[nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy]] ([[proton NMR]]) in the following way. NMR ordinarily requires compounds of interest to be analyzed as dissolved in solution. Because of deuterium's nuclear spin properties which differ from the light hydrogen usually present in organic molecules, NMR spectra of hydrogen/protium are highly differentiable from that of deuterium, and in practice deuterium is not "seen" by an NMR instrument tuned for light-hydrogen. Deuterated solvents (including heavy water, but also compounds like deuterated chloroform, CDCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) are therefore routinely used in NMR spectroscopy, in order to allow only the light-hydrogen spectra of the compound of interest to be measured, without solvent-signal interference.

Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy can also be used to obtain information about the deuteron's environment in isotopically labelled samples ([[Deuterium NMR]]). For example, the flexibility in the tail, which is a long hydrocarbon chains, in deuterium-labelled lipid molecules can be quantified using solid state deuterium NMR.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Seelig, J. |doi=10.1021/ja00749a006 |title=Flexibility of hydrocarbon chains in lipid bilayers |journal=J. Am. Chem. Soc. |year=1971 |volume=93 |issue=20 |pages=5017–5022 |pmid=4332660}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Deuterium NMR spectra are especially informative in the solid state because of its relatively small quadrupole moment in comparison with those of bigger quadrupolar nuclei such as chlorine-35, for example.

===Tracing===
In [[chemistry]], [[biochemistry]] and [[environmental sciences]], deuterium is used as a non-radioactive, [[Hydrogen isotope biogeochemistry|stable isotopic tracer]], for example, in the [[doubly labeled water test]]. In [[chemical reaction]]s and [[metabolic pathway]]s, deuterium behaves somewhat similarly to ordinary hydrogen (with a few chemical differences, as noted). It can be distinguished from ordinary hydrogen most easily by its mass, using [[mass spectrometry]] or [[infrared spectrometry]]. Deuterium can be detected by [[femtosecond]] [[infrared]] spectroscopy, since the mass difference drastically affects the frequency of molecular vibrations; deuterium-carbon bond vibrations are found in spectral regions free of other signals.

Measurements of small variations in the natural abundances of deuterium, along with those of the stable heavy oxygen isotopes &lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt;O and &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O, are of importance in [[hydrology]], to trace the geographic origin of Earth's waters. The heavy isotopes of hydrogen and oxygen in rainwater (so-called [[meteoric water]]) are enriched as a function of the environmental temperature of the region in which the precipitation falls (and thus enrichment is related to mean latitude). The relative enrichment of the heavy isotopes in rainwater (as referenced to mean ocean water), when plotted against temperature falls predictably along a line called the [[global meteoric water line]] (GMWL). This plot allows samples of precipitation-originated water to be identified along with general information about the climate in which it originated. Evaporative and other processes in bodies of water, and also ground water processes, also differentially alter the ratios of heavy hydrogen and oxygen isotopes in fresh and salt waters, in characteristic and often regionally distinctive ways.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sahra.arizona.edu/programs/isotopes/oxygen.html |title=Oxygen – Isotopes and Hydrology |publisher=SAHRA |accessdate=2007-09-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070102124117/http://www.sahra.arizona.edu/programs/isotopes/oxygen.html |archivedate=2 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ratio of concentration of &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;H to &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H is usually indicated with a delta as δ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;H and the geographic patterns of these values are plotted in maps termed as isoscapes. Stable isotope are incorporated into plants and animals and an analysis of the ratios in a migrant bird or insect can help suggest a rough guide to their origins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Isoscapes: Understanding movement, pattern, and process on Earth through isotope mapping |first=Jason B. |last=West |publisher=Springer |year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hobson |first1=K.A. |last2=Van Wilgenburg |first2=S.L. |last3=Wassenaar |first3=L.I. |last4=Larson |first4=K. |year=2012 |title=Linking Hydrogen (δ2H) Isotopes in Feathers and Precipitation: Sources of Variance and Consequences for Assignment to Isoscapes |journal=PLOS ONE |volume=7 |issue=4 |pages=e35137 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0035137 |pmid=22509393 |pmc=3324428 |bibcode=2012PLoSO...735137H}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contrast properties===
[[Neutron scattering]] techniques particularly profit from availability of deuterated samples: The H and D cross sections are very distinct and different in sign, which allows contrast variation in such experiments. Further, a nuisance problem of ordinary hydrogen is its large incoherent neutron cross section, which is nil for D. The substitution of deuterium atoms for hydrogen atoms thus reduces scattering noise.

Hydrogen is an important and major component in all materials of organic chemistry and life science, but it barely interacts with X-rays. As hydrogen (and deuterium) interact strongly with neutrons, neutron scattering techniques, together with a modern deuteration facility,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nmi3.eu/about-nmi3/joint-research-activities/deuteration.html |title=NMI3 – Deuteration |publisher=NMI3 |accessdate=2012-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; fills a niche in many studies of macromolecules in biology and many other areas.

===Nuclear weapons===
This is discussed below. It is notable that although most stars, including the Sun, generate energy over most of their lives by fusing hydrogen into heavier elements, such fusion of light hydrogen (protium) has never been successful in the conditions attainable on Earth. Thus, all artificial fusion, including the hydrogen fusion that occurs in so-called hydrogen bombs, requires heavy hydrogen (either tritium or deuterium, or both) in order for the process to work.

===Drugs===
{{Main|deuterated drug}}
A deuterated drug is a [[small molecule]] medicinal product in which one or more of the [[hydrogen]] atoms contained in the drug molecule have been replaced by deuterium. Because of the [[kinetic isotope effect]], deuterium-containing drugs may have significantly lower rates of [[metabolism]], and hence a longer [[biological half-life|half-life]].&lt;ref name="pmid19295573"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Sanderson K |title=Big interest in heavy drugs |journal=Nature |volume=458 |issue=7236 |pages=269 |date=March 2009 |pmid=19295573 |doi=10.1038/458269a}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid23744136"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Katsnelson, A |title=Heavy drugs draw heavy interest from pharma backers |journal=Nature Medicine |volume=19 |issue=6 |pages=656 |date=June 2013 |pmid=23744136 |doi=10.1038/nm0613-656}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid24294889"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gant, TG |title=Using deuterium in drug discovery: leaving the label in the drug |journal=Journal of Medicinal Chemistry |volume=57 |issue=9 |pages=3595–3611 |date=May 2014 |pmid=24294889 |doi=10.1021/jm4007998}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2017, [[deutetrabenazine]] became the first deuterated drug to receive FDA approval.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Schmidt |first1=Charles |date=10 July 2017 |title=First deuterated drug approved |url=https://www.nature.com/nbt/journal/v35/n6/full/nbt0617-493.html |journal=[[Nature Biotechnology]] |doi=10.1038/nbt0617-493 |pmid=28591114 |access-date=10 July 2017 |volume=35 |issue=6 |pages=493–494}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Suspicion of lighter element isotopes===
The existence of nonradioactive isotopes of lighter elements had been suspected in studies of neon as early as 1913, and proven by mass spectrometry of light elements in 1920. The prevailing theory at the time was that isotopes of an element differ by the existence of additional ''protons'' in the nucleus accompanied by an equal number of  ''[[Discovery of the neutron#Problems of the nuclear electrons hypothesis|nuclear electrons]]''. In this theory, the deuterium nucleus with mass two and charge one would contain two protons and one nuclear electron. However it was expected that the element hydrogen with a measured average atomic mass very close to {{val|1|u=u}}, the known mass of the proton, always has a nucleus composed of a single proton (a known particle), and could not contain a second proton. Thus, hydrogen could have no heavy isotopes.

===Deuterium detected===
&lt;!--Deuterium was predicted in 1926 by [[Walter Russell]], using his "spiral" periodic table{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}, and independently by [[Charles Janet]] in 1928.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Stewart |first1=Philip J. |title=Charles Janet: unrecognized genius of the periodic system |journal=Foundations of Chemistry |volume=12 |pages=5–15 |year=2009 |doi=10.1007/s10698-008-9062-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt;
[[File:Urey.jpg|thumb|upright|Harold Urey]]
It was first detected spectroscopically in late 1931 by [[Harold Urey]], a chemist at [[Columbia University]]. Urey's collaborator, [[Ferdinand Brickwedde]], [[Distillation|distilled]] five [[liter]]s of [[cryogenics|cryogenically produced]] [[liquid hydrogen]] to {{val|1|ul=mL}} of liquid, using the low-temperature physics laboratory that had recently been established at the National Bureau of Standards in Washington, D.C. (now the [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]]). The technique had previously been used to isolate heavy isotopes of neon. The cryogenic boiloff technique concentrated the fraction of the mass-2 isotope of hydrogen to a degree that made its spectroscopic identification unambiguous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Brickwedde |first1=Ferdinand G. |title=Harold Urey and the discovery of deuterium |journal=Physics Today |volume=35 |page=34 |year=1982 |doi=10.1063/1.2915259 |bibcode=1982PhT....35i..34B |issue=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Urey |first1=Harold |last2=Brickwedde |first2=F. |last3=Murphy |first3=G. |title=A Hydrogen Isotope of Mass 2 |journal=Physical Review |volume=39 |issue=1 |pages=164–165 |year=1932 |doi=10.1103/PhysRev.39.164 |bibcode=1932PhRv...39..164U}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Naming of the isotope and Nobel Prize===
Urey created the names protium, deuterium, and tritium in an article published in 1934. The name is based in part on advice from [[G. N. Lewis]] who had proposed the name "deutium". The name is derived from the,  Greek deuteros (second), and the nucleus to be called "deuteron" or "deuton". Isotopes and new elements were traditionally given the name that their discoverer decided. Some British scientists, such as [[Ernest Rutherford]], wanted the isotope to be called "diplogen", from the Greek diploos (double), and the nucleus to be called diplon.&lt;ref name="diplogen" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Science: Deuterium v. Diplogen |date=19 February 1934 |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,746988,00.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The amount inferred for normal abundance of this heavy isotope of hydrogen was so small (only about 1 atom in 6400 hydrogen atoms in ocean water (156 deuteriums per million hydrogens)) that it had not noticeably affected previous measurements of (average) hydrogen atomic mass. This explained why it hadn't been experimentally suspected before. Urey was able to concentrate water to show partial enrichment of deuterium. Lewis had prepared the first samples of pure heavy water in 1933. The discovery of deuterium, coming before the discovery of the [[neutron]] in 1932, was an experimental shock to theory, but when the neutron was reported, making deuterium's existence more explainable, deuterium won Urey the [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] in 1934. Lewis was embittered by being passed over for this recognition given to his former student.&lt;ref name="diplogen"/&gt;

==="Heavy water" experiments in World War II===
{{Main|Heavy water}}
Shortly before the war, [[Hans von Halban]] and [[Lew Kowarski]] moved their research on neutron moderation from France to England, smuggling the entire global supply of heavy water (which had been made in Norway) across in twenty-six steel drums.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Sherriff |first=Lucy |title=Royal Society unearths top secret nuclear research |work=The Register |publisher=Situation Publishing Ltd. |date=1 June 2007 |url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2007/06/01/royal_soc_secret_physics/ |accessdate=2007-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Battle for Heavy Water Three physicists' heroic exploits |work=CERN Bulletin |publisher=[[European Organization for Nuclear Research]] |date=25 March 2002 |url=http://cds.cern.ch/record/45637?ln=en |accessdate=2015-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During [[World War II]], [[Nazi Germany]] was known to be conducting experiments using heavy water as moderator for a [[nuclear reactor]] design. Such experiments were a source of concern because they might allow them to produce [[plutonium]] for an [[atomic bomb]]. Ultimately it led to the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] operation called the "[[Norwegian heavy water sabotage]]", the purpose of which was to destroy the [[Vemork]] deuterium production/enrichment facility in Norway. At the time this was considered important to the potential progress of the war.

After World War II ended, the Allies discovered that Germany was not putting as much serious effort into the program as had been previously thought. They had been unable to sustain a chain reaction. The Germans had completed only a small, partly built experimental reactor (which had been hidden away). By the end of the war, the Germans did not even have a fifth of the amount of heavy water needed to run the reactor,{{clarify|reason=why did they need heavy water to run a reactor?|date=February 2014}} partially due to the Norwegian heavy water sabotage operation. However, even had the Germans succeeded in getting a reactor operational (as the U.S. did with a graphite reactor in late 1942), they would still have been at least several years away from development of an [[atomic bomb]] with maximal effort. The engineering process, even with maximal effort and funding, required about two and a half years (from first critical reactor to bomb) in both the U.S. and [[U.S.S.R.]], for example.

===In thermonuclear weapons===
{{main|Thermonuclear weapon}}
[[File:Ivy Mike Sausage device.jpg|right|thumb|upright=1.5|A view of the ''Sausage'' device casing of the [[Ivy Mike]] [[hydrogen bomb]], with its instrumentation and cryogenic equipment attached. This bomb held a cryogenic Dewar flask containing room for as much as 160 kilograms of liquid deuterium. The bomb was 20 feet tall. Note the seated man at the right of the photo for the scale.]]

The 62-ton [[Ivy Mike]] device built by the United States and exploded on 1 November 1952, was the first fully successful "[[hydrogen bomb]]" or [[thermonuclear bomb]]. In this context, it was the first bomb in which most of the energy released came from [[nuclear reaction]] stages that followed the primary [[nuclear fission]] stage of the [[atomic bomb]]. The Ivy Mike bomb was a factory-like building, rather than a deliverable weapon. At its center, a very large cylindrical, insulated [[vacuum flask]] or [[cryostat]], held [[cryogenic]] liquid deuterium in a volume of about 1000 [[liter]]s (160 kilograms in mass, if this volume had been completely filled). Then, a conventional [[atomic bomb]] (the "primary") at one end of the bomb was used to create the conditions of extreme temperature and pressure that were needed to set off the [[thermonuclear reaction]].

Within a few years, so-called "dry" hydrogen bombs were developed that did not need cryogenic hydrogen. Released information suggests that all [[thermonuclear weapon]]s built since then contain [[chemical compound]]s of deuterium and lithium in their secondary stages. The material that contains the deuterium is mostly [[lithium deuteride]], with the lithium consisting of the isotope [[lithium-6]]. When the lithium-6 is bombarded with fast [[neutron]]s from the atomic bomb, [[tritium]] ([[hydrogen-3]]) is produced, and then the deuterium and the tritium quickly engage in [[thermonuclear fusion]], releasing abundant energy, [[helium-4]], and even more free neutrons.

===Modern research===
In August 2018, scientists announced the transformation of gaseous deuterium into a [[Metallic hydrogen|liquid metallic form]]. This may help researchers better understand [[Gas giant|giant gas planets]], such as Jupiter, Saturn and related [[exoplanet]]s, since such planets are thought to contain a lot of liquid metallic hydrogen, which may be responsible for their observed powerful [[magnetic field]]s.&lt;ref name="NYT-20180816"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/16/science/metallic-hydrogen-lasers.html |title=Settling Arguments About Hydrogen With 168 Giant Lasers |work=The New York Times |first=Kenneth |last=Chang |date=16 August 2018 |accessdate=18 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SCI-20180816"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://carnegiescience.edu/news/under-pressure-hydrogen-offers-reflection-giant-planet-interiors |title=Under pressure, hydrogen offers a reflection of giant planet interiors |publisher=Carnegie Institution for Science |date=15 August 2018 |accessdate=19 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''antideuteron''' is the [[antimatter]] counterpart of the nucleus of deuterium, consisting of an [[antiproton]] and an [[antineutron]].

'''Difluorophosphate''' or '''difluorodioxophosphate''' or '''phosphorodifluoridate ''' is an anion with formula {{chem|PO|2|F|2|−}}.

==Properties==
In ammonium difluorophosphate the difluorophosphate ion has these interatomic dimensions: P–O length 1.457&amp;nbsp;Å, P–F length 1.541&amp;nbsp;Å, O–P–O angle 118.7°, F–P–O 109.4° and F–P–F angle 98.6°. [[Hydrogen bond]]ing from ammonium to oxygen atoms causes a change to the difluorophosphate ion in the ammonium salt. In potassium difluorophosphate the ion has dimensions: P–O length 1.470&amp;nbsp;Å, P–F length 1.575&amp;nbsp;Å, O–P–O angle 122.4°, F–P–O 108.6° and F–P–F angle 97.1°.&lt;ref name=Harrison69&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Harrison|first1=R.

On heating the salts that are not of alkali or alkaline earths, difluorophosphates decompose firstly by giving off [[phosphoryl fluoride|POF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]] forming a [[monofluorophosphate]] (PO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;) compound, and then this in turn decomposes to an [[orthophosphate]] {{chem|PO|4|3−}} compound.&lt;ref name=vast94&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vast|first1=P.|last2=Semmoud|first2=A.|title=Comportement thermique du difluorodioxophosphate ferreux|journal=Journal of Thermal Analysis|date=June 1994|volume=41|issue=6|pages=1489–1493|doi=10.1007/bf02549945}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vast|first1=P.|last2=Semmoud|first2=A.|last3=Palavit|first3=G.|title=Preparation de l'acide monofluorotrioxophosphorique H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;F a partir de l'acide difluorodioxophosphorique HPO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;|journal=Journal of Fluorine Chemistry|date=December 1986|volume=34|issue=2|pages=229–232|doi=10.1016/s0022-1139(00)85072-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Difluorophosphate salts are normally soluble and stable in water.  However, in acidic or alkaline conditions they can be hydrolyzed to [[monofluorophosphate]]s and hydrofluoric acid.&lt;ref name=Reed65/&gt; The caesium and potassium salts are the least soluble.&lt;ref name=Reed65/&gt;

===Difluorphosphoric acid===
Difluorphosphoric acid (HPO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) is one of the fluorophosphoric acids.  It is produced when [[phosphoryl fluoride]] reacts with water. POF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → HPO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + HF.  This in turn is [[hydrolysed]] more to give [[monofluorophosphoric acid]] (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;F), and a trace of [[hexafluorophosphoric acid]] (HPF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;). HPO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; also is produced when [[Hydrofluoric acid|HF]] reacts with [[phosphorus pentoxide]]. Yet another method involves making difluorphosphoric acid as a side product of [[calcium fluoride]] being heated with damp phosphorus pentoxide. A method to make pure difluorphosphoric acid involves heating phosphoryl fluoride with monofluorophosphoric acid and separating the product by distillation. POF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;F → 2HPO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lange|first1=Willy|last2=Livingston|first2=Ralph|title=Studies of Fluorophosphoric Acids and their Derivatives.

The '''digital micromirror device''', or '''DMD''', is a [[Micro-Opto-Electro-Mechanical Systems|micro-opto-electromechanical system]] (MOEMS) that is the core of the trademarked DLP projection technology from [[Texas Instruments]] (TI). The DMD was [[invent]]ed by solid state physicist and TI Fellow Emeritus [[Larry Hornbeck|Dr. Larry Hornbeck]] in 1987.&lt;ref&gt;[http://invent.org/inductee-detail/?IID=397 "Larry Hornbeck, Digital Micromirror Device, US Patent No. 5,061,049, Inducted in 2009"], "National Inventors Hall of Fame"&lt;/ref&gt;

The DMD project began as the Deformable Mirror Device in 1977 using micromechanical analog light modulators.  The first analog DMD product was the TI DMD2000 airline ticket printer that used a DMD instead of a laser scanner.

A DMD chip has on its surface several hundred thousand microscopic [[mirror]]s arranged in a [[rectangular]] [[Array data structure|array]] which correspond to the [[pixel]]s in the image to be displayed. The mirrors can be individually rotated ±10-12°, to an on or off state. In the on state, light from the projector bulb is reflected into the lens making the pixel appear bright on the screen. In the off state, the light is directed elsewhere (usually onto a [[heatsink]]), making the pixel appear dark.

To produce [[greyscale]]s, the mirror is toggled on and off very quickly, and the ratio of on time to off time determines the shade produced (binary [[pulse-width modulation]]). Contemporary DMD chips can produce up to 1024 shades of gray (10 bits). See [[Digital Light Processing]] for discussion of how color images are produced in DMD-based systems.

[[File:Digital micromirror2.svg|thumb|right|Diagram of a Digital micromirror showing the mirror mounted on the suspended yoke with the torsion spring running bottom left to top right (light grey), with the electrostatic pads of the memory cells below (top left and bottom right)]]
The mirrors themselves are made out of [[aluminum]] and are around 16 micrometers across. Each one is mounted on a yoke which in turn is connected to two support posts by compliant [[torsion spring|torsion hinge]]s. In this type of hinge, the axle is fixed at both ends and twists in the middle. Because of the small scale, hinge [[Fatigue (material)|fatigue]] is not a problem     &lt;ref name=DMDReliability&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = Douglass | first1 = M. R. | chapter = Lifetime estimates and unique failure mechanisms of the Digital Micromirror Device (DMD) | doi = 10.1109/RELPHY.1998.670436 | title = 1998 IEEE International Reliability Physics Symposium Proceedings 36th Annual (Cat No 98CH36173) RELPHY-98 | pages = 9–9 | year = 1998 | isbn = 0-7803-4400-6 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; and tests have shown that even 1 [[1000000000000 (number)|trillion]] (10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;) operations do not cause noticeable damage. Tests have also shown that the hinges cannot be damaged by normal shock and vibration, since it is absorbed by the DMD superstructure.

Two pairs of electrodes control the position of the mirror by [[electrostatic]] attraction. Each pair has one electrode on each side of the hinge, with one of the pairs positioned to act on the yoke and the other acting directly on the mirror. The majority of the time, equal bias charges are applied to both sides simultaneously. Instead of flipping to a central position as one might expect, this actually holds the mirror in its current position. This is because attraction force on the side the mirror is already tilted towards is greater, since that side is closer to the electrodes.

To move the mirrors, the required state is first loaded into an [[static RAM|SRAM]] cell located beneath each pixel, which is also connected to the electrodes. Once all the SRAM cells have been loaded, the bias voltage is removed, allowing the charges from the SRAM cell to prevail, moving the mirror. When the bias is restored, the mirror is once again held in position, and the next required movement can be loaded into the memory cell.

The bias system is used because it reduces the voltage levels required to address the pixels such that they can be driven directly from the SRAM cell, and also because the bias voltage can be removed at the same time for the whole chip, so every mirror moves at the same instant. The advantages of the latter are more accurate timing and a more [[film|cinemat]]ic moving image.

The '''Indian [[electronics]] industry''' is seeing growth encouraged both by government policies and incentives and by international investment. Its key and most resource-intensive segment, the '''[[semiconductor manufacturing|semiconductor industry]]''' has substantial potential for growth since domestic demand is growing briskly. Semiconductors are required by a large number of industries, including telecommunications, information technology, industrial machinery and automation, medical electronics, automobile, engineering, power and solar photovoltaic, defense and aerospace, consumer electronics, and appliances. According to a NOVONOUS report, a steady and significant spurt in the semiconductor industry will increase the domestic market size fivefold during 2013-2020. As of 2015, however, the skill gap in Indian industry threatened progress, with 65 to 70 per cent of the market relying on imports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/news/electronics-manufacturing-gears-up-for-change-but-skill-gap-remains/article6861498.ece|date=February 5, 2015|accessdate=January 15, 2018|title=Electronics manufacturing gears up for change but skill gap remains|last=Chengappa|first=Sangeetha}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Electronics industry==

===Statistics and trends===

====Market-size====
India's electronics market one of the largest in the world in terms of consumption, is predicted to grow to approximately [[US$]]400&amp;nbsp;billion by 2020 from $69.6&amp;nbsp;billion in 2012, largely led by up-surge in demand, growing at a projected [[compound annual growth rate]] of close to 25% over the period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ibef.org/industry/electronics-presentation|title=Electronics presentation |publisher= [[India Brand Equity Foundation]]|access-date=2016-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics and detractors of the fab projects currently underway in India, in different conceptual phases, doubt the prospects of success of these capital-intensive projects, pointing to various reasons like marginal profitability due to overcapacity of output in a saturated and fiercely competed fab market, noncompetence of these particular fabs in terms of cost and performance related to the dimensions of CMOS nodes even in attracting domestic end-use industries which have access to the more sophisticated fabs outside the country, cost prohibitive maintenance and upgrades needed every few years to weather obsolescence, nonavailability of domestically procurable semiconductor-grade materials in absence of complementing ancillary manufacturing industries and other resource-intensive strings attached to such projects, including land acquisition requirements,necessity uninterrupted deionised water and power supplies, supply of critical gases such as nitrogen and argon, absence of skilled labour force and drain of an already inadequate number of experienced domestic talent pool in electronic engineering and R&amp;D possessing expertise to overcome the barriers of related sensitive technologies for mass production towards other attractive sectors in absence of a major Indian player in the electronics sector, especially in a developing country like India, which is still grappling with infrastructural bottlenecks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/Does-India-really-need-a-5bn-semiconductor-unit/articleshow/48151513.cms?mobile=no#_ga=1.107637570.1745289644.1450296943|title= Does India really need a $5bn semiconductor unit?|author=Vinod Dham|publisher=Times Of India, India Times, The Economic Times|access-date=2016-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=

However, the endorsers of the fab projects, such as AMD, which partnered with [[Hindustan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation|HSMC]] for the fab project in Gujarat, stress the strategic need of developing the fabs as part of an end-to-end electronics manufacturing base in India which imports billions of dollars worth of even lower-end semiconductor nodes of 90&amp;nbsp;nm and above each year.&lt;ref name="Amdsupport"/&gt;

Relevant circles within India have been advocating for investment by the central government with a long term strategic vision in the revolutionising fields of Gallium Nitride (GaN) and Mercury Cadmium Telluride (HgCdTe) based non silica semiconductor foundry and fab because of their wide ranged use like High Electron Mobility Transistor (HEMT) made from GaN in power electronics both for civilian and military applications which can switch at high speed and can handle high power and high temperature without needing any cooling and HgCdTe based high quality sensors for military space requirements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.deccanherald.com/content/663415/dont-miss-bus-semiconductors.html|title=Don't miss bus on new semiconductors|author=Saurav Jha|access-date=2018-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1325">The '''fire point''' of a [[fuel]] is the lowest temperature at which the vapour of that fuel will continue to burn for at least 5 seconds after ignition by an open flame.  At the [[flash point]], a lower temperature, a substance will ignite briefly, but vapor might not be produced at a rate to sustain the fire.  Most tables of material properties will only list material flash points. Although in general the fire points can be assumed to be about 10 °C higher than the flash points&lt;ref name=ntt/&gt; this is no substitute for testing if the fire point is safety critical.&lt;ref name=ntt/&gt; 

Testing of the fire point is done by [[Cleveland open-cup method|open cup apparatus]].&lt;ref name=ntt&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nttworldwide.com/tech2212.htm|title=Flash Point and Fire Point|accessdate=2010-05-27|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101214222420/http://www.nttworldwide.com/tech2212.htm|archivedate=2010-12-14|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.astm.org/Standards/D92.htm "Standard Test Method for Flash and Fire Points by Cleveland Open Cup Tester"], ASTM.org&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gelonus''' was, according to [[Herodotus]], the capital of the [[Gelonians]].
== Search for Gelonus ==

In his account of [[Scythia]] (''Inquiries'' book 4), [[Herodotus]] writes that the [[Gelonians|Gelonii]] were formerly Greeks, having settled away from the coastal [[Emporium (antiquity)|emporia]] among the [[Budini]], where they "use a tongue partly Scythian and partly Greek":&lt;blockquote&gt;''The Budini for their part, being a large and numerous nation, are all mightily blue-eyed and ruddy.  And a city among them has been built, a wooden city, and the name of the city is Gelonus.  Of its wall then in size each side is of thirty [[Stadion (unit)|stades]] and high and all wooden. And their homes are wooden and their shrines.  For indeed there is in the very place Greek gods’ shrines adorned in the Greek way with statues, altars and wooden shrines and for triennial Dionysus festivals in honour of Dionysus...Above the Sauromatae ([[Sarmatian|Sarmatians]]), possessing the second region, dwell the Budini, whose territory is thickly wooded with trees of every kind.  The Budini are a large and powerful nation: they have all deep blue eyes, and bright red hair.  The Budini, however, do not speak the same language as the Geloni, nor is their mode of life the same.  They are the aboriginal people of the country, and are [[nomads]]; unlike any of the neighbouring races, they eat 'phtheir'.&lt;ref&gt;''Ancient Greece: Social and Historical Documents from Archaic Times to the Death of Socrates (c.800-399 B.C.)''; by Matthew Dillon, Lynda Garland; edition: 2, illustrated Published by Routledge, 2000 {{ISBN|0-415-21755-5}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=aW96BqEUEjsC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_summary_r&amp;cad=0] quote ''"the word phtheir" (or vscheir) "have a secondary meaning"'' Some translate word phtheir to [[lice]] П. М. Золин. Гелоны http://www.proza.ru/2010/04/02/272&lt;/ref&gt; Their country is thickly planted with trees of all manner of kinds.  In the very woodiest part is a broad deep lake, surrounded by marshy ground with reeds growing on it. Here otters are caught, and beavers, with another sort of animal which has a square face.  With the skins of this last the natives border their capotes: and they also get from them a remedy, which is of virtue in diseases of the womb...Beyond the Budini, as one goes northward, first there is a desert, seven days' journey across...''&lt;/blockquote&gt;The fortified settlement of Gelonus was reached by the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian]] army of [[Darius I|Darius]] in [[European Scythian campaign of Darius I|his assault on Scythia]] during the late 6th century BC, already burned to the ground, the Budini having abandoned it before the Persian advance. The Scythians sent a message to Darius: "We are free as wind and what you can catch in our land is only the wind".  By employing a [[scorched earth]] strategy, they avoided battles, leaving "earth without grass" by burning the [[steppe]] in front of the advancing Persians (Herodotus).  The Persian army returned without a single battle or any significant success.

According to some researchers, the [[Budini]]s were a Finnic tribe ruled by the [[Scythian]]s.{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}

Excavations at ''Bilske Horodyshche'' ([[:uk:Більське городище]]) near the village of [[Bilsk, Kotelva Raion|Bilsk]] near [[Poltava]] in [[Ukraine]] (Coordinates {{Coord|50|5|34|N|34|38|46|E|}} ) have led to suggestions by archaeologist [[Boris Shramko]] and others identifying it as the Scythian capital Gelonus.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; It is strategically situated on the exact boundary between the [[steppe]] and forest-steppe. Several other locations have traditionally been named by Russian archaeologists, such as [[Saratov]] (according to [[Ivan Zabelin]]) or a location near the [[Don River (Russia)|Don River]] closer to the [[Volga River]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

According to Herodotus each side of Gelonus is 30 stades long, the area in today's units would be about 30 square kilometres. The archeological site around Belsk, including necropolis, comprises about 80&amp;nbsp;km², and the fortifications enclose some 40&amp;nbsp;km².  The north-south axis, along the [[Vorskla River]] is 17&amp;nbsp;km long. The remains of walls up to 12 metres are visible today and stretch over the horizon. The total length of the ramparts is 33&amp;nbsp;km.  Inside the fortification, lay three "keeps", 150,000 m², 650,000 m², and 720,000 m² in area, surrounded by eroded earth walls still up to 16 metres high. Several [[kurgans]] reminded the inhabitants of the ancient Scythian burial tradition.

== Mythology ==
In Greek [[mythology]], '''Gelonus''' was the son of [[Echidna (mythology)|Echidna]]  and [[Heracles]], he had an older brother [[Agathyrsus]] and a younger Scythes.&lt;ref&gt;Herodot iv 8-10 L.S. {{cite web |url=http://www.ancientlibrary.com/smith-bio/1111.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-02-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070202192429/http://www.ancientlibrary.com/smith-bio/1111.html |archivedate=2007-02-02 |df= }} e p-3.&lt;/ref&gt; Hylea is pointed to be where was the Echidna's cave between people [[Arimi]] or [[Harimi]], the Greeks on the [[Euxine]] believed that this was somewhere in Scythia.

'''Grand Lake''' is [[Colorado]]'s largest and deepest natural [[lake]].&lt;ref&gt;Pennak, R.W. 1955 ''Comparative Limnology of Eight Colorado Mountain Lakes.'' University of Colorado Studies, Series in Biology 2:1-71, Boulder, CO 1955&lt;/ref&gt;  It is located in the [[headwater]]s of the [[Colorado River]] in [[Grand County, Colorado]]. On its north shore is located the historic and eponymous town of [[Grand Lake, Colorado|Grand Lake]]. The lake fills a glaciated valley that is dammed in part by [[glacier|glacial]] [[till]] from the [[Pinedale Glaciation]], and is younger than about 12,000 years. Natural tributaries to the lake are the [[North Inlet]] and [[East Inlet]], both of which flow out of [[Rocky Mountain National Park]], which surrounds the lake on three sides: Grand Lake is located 1 mile from the Park's western entrance.  Grand Lake was named Spirit Lake by the [[Ute Tribe]] because they believed the lake's cold waters to be the dwelling place of departed souls.

==Colorado-Big Thompson Project==
As part of the [[Colorado-Big Thompson Project]],
Grand Lake forms a continuous body of water with the man-made reservoir [[Shadow Mountain Lake]], which under natural conditions then flows into another man-made reservoir, [[Lake Granby]]. The elevation of Grand Lake is maintained between 8,367 feet (2,550 meters) and 8,366 feet (2,549.8 meters). When the Colorado-Big Thompson (C-BT) project is diverting water to northeastern Colorado, water collected in Lake Granby can be pumped back into Shadow Mountain where it flows backward into Grand Lake, then under [[Rocky Mountain National Park]] and the [[Continental Divide]] via the [[Alva B. Adams Tunnel]] to the [[Big Thompson River]] on the eastern slope of the [[Rocky Mountains]]. From there, the water flows into the [[South Platte River]] and is used for [[agriculture]], [[municipal]], and [[Industry|industrial]] purposes. Diverted C-BT water provides [[hydroelectric power]] to five [[power station]]s on the eastern slope of the Colorado Rockies.

The C-BT is one of the first of many large-scale diversions of water from the [[Colorado River Basin]] between [[Colorado]] and the [[Gulf of California]]. Because the C-BT Project moves water from the Colorado Basin to the South Platte Basin, or, on a larger scale, from the [[Colorado River]], which drains to the [[Gulf of California]] to the [[Mississippi River]], which drains to the [[Gulf of Mexico]], the project is considered a [[transbasin diversion]].

'''HVDC BorWin3''' is a [[high voltage direct current]] (HVDC) link under construction to transmit [[Offshore wind power]] to the [[power grid]] of the [[Germany|German mainland]].    The project differs from most HVDC systems in that one of the two [[HVDC converter station|converter stations]] is built on a platform in the sea.  [[HVDC converter#Voltage-Sourced Converter|Voltage-Sourced Converters]] with DC ratings of 900&amp;nbsp;MW, ±320&amp;nbsp;kV are used and the total cable length is 160&amp;nbsp;km.

'''Iron(II,III) oxide''' is the chemical compound with formula Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;. It occurs in nature as the mineral [[magnetite]]. It is one of a number of [[iron oxides]], the others being [[iron(II) oxide]] (FeO), which is rare, and [[iron(III) oxide]] (Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) also known as [[hematite]]. It contains both Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; ions and is sometimes formulated as FeO ∙ Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. This iron oxide is encountered in the laboratory as a black powder. It exhibits permanent magnetism and is [[ferrimagnetic]], but is sometimes incorrectly described as [[ferromagnetic]].&lt;ref name = "Greenwood"&gt;{{Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its most extensive use is as a black pigment. For this purpose, it is synthesised rather than being extracted from the naturally occurring mineral as the particle size and shape can be varied by the method of production.&lt;ref name = "Cornell"&gt;Rochelle M. Cornell, Udo Schwertmann 2007 ''The Iron Oxides: Structure, Properties, Reactions, Occurrences and Uses'' Wiley-VCH {{ISBN|3-527-60644-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Preparation==
Under [[Hypoxia (environmental)|anaerobic]] conditions, [[ferrous hydroxide]] (Fe(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) can be oxidized by water to form magnetite and molecular [[hydrogen]]. This process is described by the [[Schikorr reaction]]:
:&lt;chem&gt;\underset{ferrous\ hydroxide}{3Fe(OH)2} -&gt; \underset{magnetite}{Fe3O4} + \underset{hydrogen}{H2} + \underset{water}{2H2O}&lt;/chem&gt;
The well-crystallized magnetite (Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) is thermodynamically more stable than the ferrous hydroxide (Fe(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ma|first=Ming|author2=Zhang, Yu |author3=Guo, Zhirui |author4= Gu, Ning |title=Facile synthesis of ultrathin magnetic iron oxide nanoplates by Schikorr reaction|journal=Nanoscale Research Letters|year=2013|volume=8|issue=1|pages=16|doi=10.1186/1556-276X-8-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Magnetite can be prepared in the laboratory as a [[ferrofluid]] in the [[Massart method]] by mixing [[iron(II) chloride]] and [[iron(III) chloride]] in the presence of [[sodium hydroxide]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Massart|first1=R.|title=Preparation of aqueous magnetic liquids in alkaline and acidic media|journal=IEEE Transactions on Magnetics|date=1981|volume=17|issue=2|pages=1247–1248|doi=10.1109/TMAG.1981.1061188}}&lt;/ref&gt; Magnetite can also be prepared by the chemical co-precipitation in presence of ammonia, which consist in a mixture of a solution 0.1 M of FeCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;·6H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O and FeCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;·4H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O with mechanic agitation of about 2000 rpm. The molar ratio of FeCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;:FeCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; can be 2:1; heating this solution at 70&amp;nbsp;°C, and immediately the speed is elevated to 7500 rpm and adding quickly a solution of NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;OH (10 volume %), immediately a dark precipitate will be formed, which consists of nanoparticles of magnetite.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Keshavarz|first1=Sahar|last2=Xu|first2=Yaolin|last3=Hrdy|first3=Spencer|last4=Lemley|first4=Clay|last5=Mewes|first5=Tim|last6=Bao|first6=Yuping|title=Relaxation of Polymer Coated Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; Magnetic Nanoparticles in Aqueous Solution|journal=IEEE Transactions on Magnetics|date=2010|volume=46|issue=6|pages=1541–1543|doi=10.1109/TMAG.2010.2040588}}&lt;/ref&gt; In both cases, the precipitation reaction rely on a quick transformation of acidic hydrolyzed iron ions into the spinel iron oxide structure, by hydrolysis at elevated pH values (above ca. 10).

Considerable efforts has been devoted towards controlling the particle formation process of magnetite nanoparticles due to the challenging and complex chemistry reactions involved in the phase transformations prior to the formation of the magnetite spinel structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jolivet|first1=Jean-Pierre|last2=Chanéac|first2=Corinne|last3=Tronc|first3=Elisabeth|title=Iron oxide chemistry. From molecular clusters to extended solid networks|journal=Chemical Communications|date=2004|issue=5|pages=477–483|doi=10.1039/B304532N}}&lt;/ref&gt; Magnetite particles are of interests in bioscience applications such as in [[magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI) since iron oxide magnetite nanoparticles represent a non-toxic alternative to currently employed gadolinium-based [[contrast agents]]. However, due to lack of control over the specific transformations involved in the formation of the particles, truly superparamagnetic particles have not yet been prepared from magnetite, i.e. magnetite nanoparticles that completely lose their permanent magnetic characteristic in the absence of an external magnetic field (which by definition show a coercivity of 0 A/m). The smallest values currently reported for nanosized magnetite particles is ''Hc'' = 8.5 A m&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ström|first1=Valter|last2=Olsson|first2=Richard T.|last3=Rao|first3=K.

Pigment quality Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, so called synthetic magnetite, can be prepared using processes that use industrial wastes, scrap iron or solutions containing iron salts (e.g. those produced as by-products in industrial processes such as the acid vat treatment ([[pickling (metal)|pickling]]) of steel):

*Oxidation of Fe metal in the Laux process where [[nitrobenzene]] is treated with iron metal using FeCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; as a catalyst to produce [[aniline]]:&lt;ref name = "Cornell"/&gt;
:C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 3 Fe + 2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O   →   C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
*Oxidation of Fe&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; compounds, e.g. the precipitation of iron(II) salts as hydroxides followed by oxidation by aeration where careful control of the pH determines the oxide produced.&lt;ref name = "Cornell"/&gt;

Production of nano-particles can be performed chemically by taking for example mixtures of Fe&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; and Fe&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt; salts and mixing them with alkali to precipitate colloidal Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;. The reaction conditions are critical to the process and determine the particle size.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur T. Hubbard (2002) ''Encyclopedia of Surface and Colloid Science'' CRC Press, {{ISBN|0-8247-0796-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reactions==
Reduction of magnetite ore by [[carbon monoxide|CO]] in a [[blast furnace]] is used to produce iron as part of steel production process:&lt;ref name = "Greenwood"/&gt;
:&lt;chem&gt;{Fe3O4} + 4CO -&gt; {3Fe} + 4CO2&lt;/chem&gt;
Controlled oxidation of Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; is used to produce brown pigment quality [[iron(III) oxide|γ-Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]] ([[maghemite]]):&lt;ref name = "Buxbaum"&gt;Gunter Buxbaum, Gerhard Pfaff (2005) ''Industrial Inorganic Pigments'' 3d edition Wiley-VCH {{ISBN|3-527-30363-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math chem&gt;\ce{\underbrace{2Fe3O4}_{magnetite} + {1/2O2} -&gt;}\ {\color{Brown}\ce{\underbrace{3(\lambda-Fe2O3)}_{maghemite}}}&lt;/math&gt;
More vigorous calcining (roasting in air) gives red pigment quality [[iron(III) oxide|α-Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]] ([[hematite]]):&lt;ref name = "Buxbaum"/&gt;
:&lt;math chem&gt;\ce{\underbrace{2Fe3O4}_{magnetite} + {1/2O2} -&gt;}\ {\color{BrickRed}\ce{\underbrace{3(\alpha-Fe2O3)}_{hematite}}}&lt;/math&gt;

==Structure==
Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; has a cubic inverse [[spinel group]] structure which consists of a cubic close packed array of oxide ions where all of the Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ions occupy half of the octahedral sites and the Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; are split evenly across the remaining octahedral sites and the tetrahedral sites.

Both [[iron(II) oxide|FeO]] and [[iron(III) oxide|γ-Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]] have a similar cubic close packed array of oxide ions and this accounts for the ready interchangeability between the three compounds on oxidation and reduction as these reactions entail a relatively small change to the overall structure.&lt;ref name="Greenwood"/&gt; Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; samples can be [[non-stoichiometric]].&lt;ref name="Greenwood"/&gt;

The [[ferrimagnetism]] of Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; arises because the electron spins of the Fe&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; and Fe&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt; ions in the octahedral sites are coupled and the spins of the Fe&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt; ions in the tetrahedral sites are coupled but anti-parallel to the former. The net effect is that the magnetic contributions of both sets are not balanced and there is a permanent magnetism.&lt;ref name = "Greenwood"/&gt;

==Properties==
[[File:Magnetite.jpg|thumb|240px|Sample of [[magnetite]], naturally occurring Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;.]]

Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; is [[ferrimagnetic]] with a [[Curie point|Curie temperature]] of 858 K. There is a phase transition at 120K, the so-called [[Verwey transition]] where there is a discontinuity in the structure, conductivity and magnetic properties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title = Electronic Conduction of Magnetite (Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) and its Transition Point at Low Temperatures |author = Verwey E. J. W. |journal = [[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |volume = 144 |pages = 327–328 (1939) |doi = 10.1038/144327b0 |year = 1939 | issue=3642}}&lt;/ref&gt; This effect has been extensively investigated and whilst various explanations have been proposed, it does not appear to be fully understood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Walz |first1=F. |title=The Verwey transition - a topical review |journal=Journal of Physics: Condensed Matter |date=2002 |volume=14 |issue=12 |pages=R285–R340 |doi=10.1088/0953-8984/14/12/203}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; is an electrical conductor with a conductivity significantly higher (X 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;) than [[iron(III) oxide|Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]], and this is ascribed to electron exchange between the Fe&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; and Fe&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt; centres.&lt;ref name = "Greenwood"/&gt;

==Uses==
Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; is used as a black pigment and is known as ''C.I pigment black 11'' (C.I. No.77499) or [[Mars Black (pigment)|Mars Black]].&lt;ref name = "Buxbaum"/&gt;

Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; is used as a catalyst in the [[Haber process]] and in the [[water-gas shift reaction]].&lt;ref name = "Lee"&gt;Sunggyu Lee (2006)  Encyclopedia of Chemical Processing CRC Press {{ISBN|0-8247-5563-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The latter uses an HTS (high temperature shift catalyst) of iron oxide stabilised by [[chromium oxide]].&lt;ref name = "Lee"/&gt; This iron–chrome catalyst is reduced at reactor start up to generate Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; from α-Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;  and Cr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; to CrO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name = "Lee"/&gt;

Nano particles of Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; are used as contrast agents in [[Magnetic resonance imaging|MRI scanning]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Synthesis of Iron Oxide Nanoparticles Used as MRI Contrast Agents: A Parametric Study |author1=Babes L |author2=Denizot B |author3=Tanguy G |author4=Le Jeune J.J. |author5=Jallet P. | journal = [[Journal of Colloid and Interface Science]] | volume = 212 | issue = 2 | year = 1999 | pages = 474–482 | doi = 10.1006/jcis.1998.6053 | pmid = 10092379}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:K-dron.png|180px|right|thumb|K-dron]]
[[File:K-dron Polyhedral.svg|180px|thumb|A K-dron net diagram]]
A '''k-dron''' is an '''eleventh-degree''' [[polyhedron]] discovered by [[Janusz Kapusta]] in 1985&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|
inventor-last=Kapusta|inventor-first=Janusz J.|title=Decorative, functional element for construction and the like|
| issue-date = Jul 21, 1987
| country-code = US
| patent-number = 4681481
}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The name k-dron comes from the word ''dron'', which in Greek means the wall, and ''k'' is the eleventh letter of the [[Latin alphabet]].

== History ==
The shape was invented during the preparation for an exhibition by [[Janusz Kapusta|Janusza Kapusty]] and his colleague in a [[New York City|New York]] gallery. After printing the leaflets promoting the exhibition, which featured the image of two squares typed one in the other, Janusz Kapusta fell into the spatial form, on the basis of which he then made a spatial model of the solid.

The k-dron consists of a k-dron surface, which is a [[diamond]] with attached right triangles and a square base. Two k-drons placed tops together forms a cube. Professor [[Janusz Łysko]] ([[Widener University]] in [[Pennsylvania]] ) gave the pattern features two variables that graphs the upper surface of a k-dron within the bounds of −1&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;''x''&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;1 and −1&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;''y''&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;1, namely:

: &lt;math&gt;f(x,y)= \frac {1}{2} \cdot (|y-x+1|-|y-x-1|+|y+x+1|-|y+x-1|-|x-1|-|x+1|)+|y-1|&lt;/math&gt;

K-dron systems can be arranged a great many different ways, creating a great variety of light and shadow patterns. As the angle of incidence changes, new patterns are created.

[[File:Koło - k-dron.jpg|180px|thumb|A monument to the K-dron in [[Koło]]]]
It is used for the design of façades of buildings, toys, games, jewelry, and even car hoods. There are an extreme variety of applications for this body – Janusz Kapusta described 50 applications in his book, and in April 2001 he stated he already found 168.

In 2009 the k-dron monument was erected before the building of the county seat in [[Koło]].

'''Kalsnava Arboretum''' ({{lang-lv|Kalsnavas arborētums}}) is an [[arboretum]] in [[Madona Municipality]], Latvia.

The arboretum was founded in 1975 with the purpose "to conduct scientific research in dendrology and [[forestry]] and plant foreign woody plants for propagating purposes". It today contains some 2,500 different [[taxon|taxa]] and some 45,000 individual plants. The whole arboretum is protected as a nature reserve by Latvian law. The arboretum is a member of the Nordic Association of Arboretums and the Baltic Association of Botanical Gardens. The arboretum is open to visitors and offers a variety of services, including the sale of plants.&lt;ref name=mammadaba&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.mammadaba.lv/en/objects/top-12/kalsnava-arboretum|title= LVM Kalsnava Arboretum|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |website= |publisher= Latvijas valsts mezi|access-date= 12 February 2017|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=travel&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.latvia.travel/en/sight/kalsnava-arboretum|title= Kalsnava Arboretum|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |website= |publisher= Latvia.travel|access-date= 12 February 2017|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Location==
The power station would be located on the [[Nile River]], downstream of [[Karuma Hydroelectric Power Station]], but upstream of [[Murchison Falls]]. This location is in [[Nwoya District]], in the [[Northern Region, Uganda|Northern Region]] of Uganda, approximately {{convert|35|km|0}}, upstream of the boundary of [[Murchison Falls National Park]].&lt;ref name="Two"/&gt;

Kiba is approximately {{convert|758|m|0}}, above sea level, and marks the point where the Kiba River enters the Nile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.getamap.net/maps/uganda/uganda_(general)/_kiba/|title=Kiba is a stream in Uganda.

==Overview==
The [[government of Uganda]] commissioned a study, titled ''Project for Master Plan Study on Hydropower Development in the Republic of Uganda'', that was conducted by ''Electric Power Development Company Limited'' and ''Nippon Koei Company Limited'', which was funded by the [[Japan International Cooperation Agency]] (JICA), in 2009. In the report of that study, published in 2011, three large hydroelectric power stations were identified for immediate envelopment, in the 2013 to 2023 time-frame, namely [[Isimba Hydroelectric Power Station]], [[Karuma Hydroelectric Power Station]] and [[Ayago Hydroelectric Power Station]].&lt;ref name="Stu"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://open_jicareport.jica.go.jp/pdf/12023768.pdf |author=JICA | publisher=[[Japan International Cooperation Agency]] (JICA) |location=Tokyo | title=JICA Open Report: Project for Master Plan Study on Hydropower Development in the Republic of Uganda |accessdate=9 March 2018 |date= March 2011 | format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two other stations were identified for development in the medium term, after the first three, namely [[Oriang Hydroelectric Power Station]] (400 megawatts),&lt;ref name="One"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Stu"/&gt; and Kiba Power Station (initially 200 megawatts).&lt;ref name="One"/&gt;

==Project development==
On 27 May 2015 the [[government of Uganda]] signed a [[Memorandum of Understanding]] (MoU) with ''China Africa Investment and Development Company'' (CAIDC), calling for a detailed feasibility study that would lead to a Build, Own, Operate and Transfer (BOOT) agreement for the Kiba Hydroelectric Power Project and the associated transmission line works.&lt;ref name="Two"/&gt; In July 2017, more than two years from the MoU, with no tangible progress, the [[Ministry of Energy and Mineral Development (Uganda)|Uganda Ministry of Energy and Mineral Development]] terminated the MoU. If this dam is o be built, a new investor will have to be sourced.&lt;ref name="Two"/&gt;

==Other considerations==
The JICA report outlined a possible phased approach, where the power station is built over a number of years and commissioned in phases, to conserve resources and avoid building over-capacity.&lt;ref name="Stu"/&gt;

The term '''laterality''' refers to the preference most [[humans]] show for one side of their [[Human body|body]] over the other. Examples include [[Handedness|left-handedness/right-handedness]] and left/right-[[footedness]]; it may also refer to the primary use of the left or right hemisphere in the brain. It may also apply to animals or plants. The majority of tests have been conducted on humans, specifically to determine the effects on language.

== Human ==

The majority of humans are [[right-handed]]. Many are also right-sided in general (that is, they prefer to use their right [[human eye|eye]], right [[foot]] and right [[ear]] if forced to make a choice between the two). The reasons for this are not fully understood, but it is thought that because the left [[cerebral hemisphere]] of the [[brain]] controls the right side of the body, the right side is generally stronger; it is suggested that the left cerebral hemisphere is dominant over the right in most humans because in 90-92% of all humans, the left hemisphere is the [[language]] hemisphere.

Human [[culture]]s are predominantly right-handed, and so the right-sided trend may be socially as well as biologically enforced. This is quite apparent from a quick survey of [[language]]s. The [[English language|English]] word "left" comes from the [[Old English language|Anglo-Saxon]] word ''lyft'' which means "weak" or "useless". Similarly, the [[French language|French]] word for left, ''gauche'', is also used to mean "awkward" or "tactless", and ''sinistra'', the [[Latin]] word from which the English word "sinister" was derived, means "left". Similarly, in many cultures the word for "right" also means "correct". The English word "right" comes from the Anglo-Saxon word ''riht'' which also means "straight" or "correct."

This linguistic and social bias is not restricted to European cultures: for example, [[Chinese language|Chinese]] characters are designed for right-handers to write, and no significant left-handed culture has ever been found in the world.

When a person is forced to use the hand opposite of the hand that they would naturally use, this is known as ''forced laterality'', or more specifically ''forced dextrality''.  A study done by the Department of Neurology at Keele University, North Staffordshire Royal Infirmary suggests that forced dextrality may be part of the reason that the percentage of left-handed people decreases with the higher age groups, both because the effects of pressures toward right-handedness are cumulative over time (hence increasing with age for any given person subjected to them) and because the prevalence of such pressure is decreasing, such that fewer members of younger generations face any such pressure to begin with.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ellis | first1 = S. J. | last2 = Ellis | first2 = P. J. | last3 = Marshall | first3 = E. | last4 = Joses | first4 = S. | year = 1998 | title = Is forced dextrality an explanation for the fall in the prevalence of sinistrality with age? A study in northern England | url = | journal = Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health | volume = 52 | issue = 1| pages = 41–44 | doi=10.1136/jech.52.1.41| pmid = 9604040 | pmc = 1756611 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ambidexterity]] is when a person has approximately equal skill with both [[hand]]s and/or both sides of the body. True ambidexterity is very rare. Although a small number of people can write competently with both hands and use both sides of their body well, even these people usually show preference for one side of their body over the other. However, this preference is not necessarily consistent for all activities. Some people may for example use their right hand for [[writing]], and their [[left-handed|left hand]] for playing [[List of sports#Racket sports|racket sports]] and [[eating]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Oldfield | first1 = R.C. | year = 1971 | title = The assessment and analysis of handedness: The Edinburgh inventory | url = | journal = Neuropsychologia | volume = 9 | issue = 1| pages = 97–113 | doi=10.1016/0028-3932(71)90067-4 | pmid=5146491}}&lt;/ref&gt; (''see also:'' [[cross-dominance]]).

Also, it is not uncommon that people preferring to use the right hand prefer to use the left leg, e.g. when using a shovel, kicking a ball, or operating control pedals. In many cases, this may be because they are disposed for left-handedness but have been trained for right-handedness. In the sport of [[cricket]], some players may find that they are more comfortable bowling with their left or right hand, but batting with the other hand.

Approximate statistics are below:&lt;ref&gt;C. Porac and S. Coren. ''Lateral preferences and human behavior''. New York: Springer-Verlag, 1981.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Favoring right hand: 88.2%
*Favoring right foot: 81.0%
*Favoring right eye: 71.1%
*Favoring right ear: 59.1%
*Same hand and foot: 84%
*Same ear and eye: 61.8%

Laterality of motor and sensory control has been the subject of a recent intense study and review.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mimickingman.com Mimicking Man.com.] I. Derakhshan, MD, Neurologist.&lt;/ref&gt; It turns out that the hemisphere of speech is the hemisphere of action in general and that the command hemisphere is located either in the right or the left hemisphere (never in both). Around eighty percent of people are left hemispheric for speech and the remainder are right hemispheric: ninety percent of right-handers are left hemispheric for speech, but only fifty percent of left-handers are right hemispheric for speech (the remainder are left hemispheric). The reaction time of the neurally dominant side of the body (the side opposite to the major hemisphere or the command center, as just defined) is shorter than that of the opposite side by an interval equal to the interhemispheric transfer time. Thus, one in five persons has a handedness that is the opposite for which they are wired (per laterality of command center or brainedness, as determined by reaction time study mentioned above).

===Different expressions===
* Board [[footedness]]: The stance in a board sport is not necessarily the same as the normal footedness of the person. In skateboarding and other board sports a goofy footed stance is one with the right foot leading.  A stance with the left foot forward is called regular or normal.
* Jump and spin: Direction of rotation in [[figure skating jumps]] and spins is not necessarily the same as the footedness or the handedness of each person. A skater can jump and spin counter-clockwise (the most common direction), yet be left-footed and left-handed.
* [[Ocular dominance]]:  The eye preferred when binocular vision is not possible, as through a keyhole or monocular microscope.

=== Speech ===

Cerebral dominance or specialization has been studied in relation to a variety of human functions. With speech in particular, many studies have been used as evidence that it is generally localized in the [[Cerebral hemisphere|left hemisphere]]. Research comparing the effects of lesions in the two hemispheres, [[split-brain]] patients, and perceptual asymmetries have aided in the knowledge of speech lateralization.  In one particular study, the left hemisphere’s sensitivity to differences in rapidly changing sound cues was noted (Annett, 1991).  This has real world implication, since very fine acoustic discriminations are needed to comprehend and produce speech signals.  In an electrical stimulation demonstration performed by Ojemann and Mateer (1979), the exposed [[Cerebral cortex|cortex]] was mapped revealing the same cortical sites were activated in phoneme discrimination and mouth movement sequences (Annett, 1991).

As suggested by Kimura (1975, 1982), left hemisphere speech lateralization might be based upon a preference for movement sequences as demonstrated by [[American Sign Language]] (ASL) studies.  Since ASL requires intricate hand movements for language communication, it was proposed that skilled hand motions and speech require sequences of action over time. In deaf patients suffering from a left hemispheric [[stroke]] and damage, noticeable losses in their abilities to sign were noted.  These cases were compared to studies of normal speakers with dysphasias located at lesioned areas similar to the deaf patients.  In the same study, deaf patients with right hemispheric lesions did not display any significant loss of signing nor any decreased capacity for motor sequencing (Annett, 1991).

One theory, known as the acoustic laterality theory, the physical properties of certain speech sounds are what determine laterality to the left hemisphere.  Stop consonants, for example t, p, or k, leave a defined silent period at the end of words that can easily be distinguished.  This theory postulates that changing sounds such as these are preferentially processed by the left hemisphere.  As a result of the right ear being responsible for transmission to sounds to the left hemisphere, it is capable of perceiving these sounds with rapid changes.  This right ear advantage in hearing and speech laterality was evidenced in [[Dichotic listening test|dichotic listening studies]]. [[Magnetic resonance imaging|Magnetic imaging]] results from this study showed greater left hemisphere activation when actual words were presented as opposed to pseudo-words (Shtyrov, Pihko, and Pulvermuller, 2005).  Two important aspects of speech recognition are phonetic cues, such as format patterning, and prosody cues, such as intonation, accent, and emotional state of the speaker (Imaizumi, Koichi, Kiritani, Hosoi &amp; Tonoike, 1998).

In a study done with both [[Monolingualism|monolinguals]] and [[Multilingualism|bilinguals]], which took into account language experience, second language proficiency, and onset of bilingualism among other variables, researchers were able to demonstrate left hemispheric dominance.  In addition, bilinguals that began speaking a second language early in life demonstrated bilateral hemispheric involvement.  The findings of this study were able to predict differing patterns of cerebral language lateralization in adulthood (Hull &amp; Vaid, 2006).

== In other animals ==
It has been shown that cerebral lateralization is a widespread phenomenon in the [[animal|animal kingdom]]&lt;ref&gt;Rogers, Lesley J., Andrew, Richard J. (2002) Comparative Vertebrate Lateralization, Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt;. Functional and structural differences between left and right brain hemispheres can be found in many other vertebrates and also in invertebrates.&lt;ref name="Manns"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Manns, M.  |author2=Ströckens, F.|year=2014|title=Functional and structural comparison of visual lateralization in birds–similar but still different|journal=Frontiers in Psychology|volume=5|pages=206|doi=10.3389/fpsyg.2014.00206|pmid=24723898|pmc=3971188}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been proposed that negative, withdrawal-associated emotions are processed predominantly by the right hemisphere, whereas the left hemisphere is largely responsible for processing positive, approach-related emotions.  This has been called the "laterality-[[Valence (psychology)|valence]] hypothesis".&lt;ref name="Barnard2015"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Barnard, S., Matthews, L., Messori, S., Podaliri-Vulpiani, M. and Ferri, N.|year=2015|title=Laterality as an indicator of emotional stress in ewes and lambs during a separation test|journal=Animal Cognition|volume=19|issue=1|pages=1–8|doi=10.1007/s10071-015-0928-3|pmid=26433604}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One sub-set of laterality in animals is limb dominance. Preferential limb use for specific tasks has been shown in species including chimpanzees, mice, bats, wallabies, parrots, chickens and toads.&lt;ref name="Manns" /&gt;

Another form of laterality is hemispheric dominance for processing conspecific vocalizations, reported for chimpanzees, sea lions, dogs, zebra finches and Bengalese finches.&lt;ref name="Manns" /&gt;

=== In mammals ===
[[Domestic horse]]s (''Equus ferus caballus'') exhibit laterality in at least two areas of neural organization, i.e. sensory and motor. In [[thoroughbred]]s, the strength of motor laterality increases with age.  Horses under 4 years old have a preference to initially use the right nostril during olfaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Motor and sensory laterality in thoroughbred horses|author1=McGreevy, P.  |author2=Rogers, L.|year= 2005|journal = Applied Animal Behaviour Science|doi = 10.1016/j.applanim.2004.11.012|issue = 4|volume = 92|pages = 337–352}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with olfaction, French horses have an eye laterality when looking at novel objects. There is a correlation between their score on an emotional index and eye preference; horses with higher emotionality are more likely to look with their left eye. The less emotive [[French saddlebred]]s glance at novel objects using the right eye, however, this tendency is absent in the [[Trotter (horse)|trotters]], although the emotive index is the same for both breeds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Laterality of horses associated with emotionality in novel situations|author=Larose, C., Richard-Yris, M.-A., Hausberger, M. and Rogers, L.J.|year=2006|journal = Laterality: Asymmetries of Body, Brain and Cognition|doi = 10.1080/13576500600624221|pmid = 16754236|issue = 4|pages = 355–367|volume = 11}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Racehorse]]s exhibit laterality in stride patterns as well. They use their preferred stride pattern at all times whether racing or not, unless they are forced to change it while turning, injured, or fatigued.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Laterality in stride pattern preference in racehorses|author1=Williams, D.E.  |author2=Norris, B.J|year=2007|journal = Animal Behaviour|doi = 10.1016/j.anbehav.2007.01.014|pmid = |access-date = |issue = 4|pages = 941–950|volume = 74}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[domestic dogs]] (''Canis familiaris''), there is a correlation between motor laterality and noise sensitivity  - a lack of paw preference is associated with noise-related fearfulness. (Branson and Rogers, 2006){{citation needed|date=June 2015}} Fearfulness is an undesirable trait in guide dogs, therefore, testing for laterality can be a useful predictor of a successful guide dog. Knowing a guide dog's laterality can also be useful for training because the dog may be better at walking to the left or the right of their blind owner.&lt;ref name="Tomkins"&gt;{{cite journal |author= Tomkins, L.M., Thomson, P.C. and McGreevy, P.D.|year=2010|title = First-stepping Test as a measure of motor laterality in dogs (Canis familiaris) | url = | journal = Journal of Veterinary Behavior: Clinical Applications and Research | volume = 5 | issue = 5| pages = 247–255 | doi = 10.1016/j.jveb.2010.03.001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Domestic cat]]s (''Felis silvestris catus'') show an individual handedness when reaching for static food.  In one study, 46% preferred to use the right paw, 44% the left, and 10% were ambi-lateral; 60% used one paw 100% of the time.  There was no difference between male and female cats in the proportions of left and right paw preferences. In moving-target reaching tests, cats have a left-sided behavioural asymmetry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Behavioural Processes|volume=39|issue=3|year=1997|pages=241–247|title=Paw preferences in cats (Felis silvestris catus) living in a household environment|doi=10.1016/S0376-6357(96)00758-9|author1=Pike, A.V.L.  |author2=Maitland, D.P.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One study indicates that laterality in this species is strongly related to temperament.

Some types of [[mastodon]] indicate laterality through the fossil remains having differing tusk lengths.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

====In marsupials====
[[Marsupials]] are fundamentally different from other mammals in that they lack a [[corpus callosum]].&lt;ref name="Nowak1999"&gt;{{cite book |last=Nowak |first=Ronald M. |title=Walker's Mammals of the World |date=1999 |publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press |isbn=978-0-8018-5789-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, wild [[kangaroo]]s and other [[Macropodidae|macropod]] [[marsupial]]s have a left-hand preference for everyday tasks.  Left-handedness is particularly apparent in the [[red kangaroo]] (''Macropus rufus'') and the [[eastern gray kangaroo]] (''Macropus giganteus'').  The [[red-necked wallaby]] (''Macropus rufogriseus'') preferentially uses the left hand for behaviours that involve fine manipulation, but the right for behaviours that require more physical strength.  There is less evidence for handedness in [[arboreal]] species.&lt;ref name="Sci-News"&gt;{{cite web |title=All kangaroos are lefties, scientists say |publisher=Sci-News.com |url=http://www.sci-news.com/biology/science-kangaroos-lefties-02929.html |date=June 18, 2015 |accessdate=June 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In birds===
[[Parrot]]s tend to favor one foot when grasping objects (for example fruit when feeding). Some studies indicate that most parrots are left footed.&lt;ref&gt;Zeigler, H. Phillip &amp; Hans-Joachim Bischof, eds. ''Vision, Brain, and Behavior in Birds.'' Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 1993. 239.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Australian magpie]] (''Gymnorhina tibicen'') uses both left-eye and right-eye laterality when performing anti-predator responses, which include [[Mobbing (animal behavior)|mobbing]].  Prior to withdrawing from a potential predator, Australian magpies view the animal with the left eye (85%), but prior to approaching, the right eye is used (72%). The left eye is used prior to jumping (73%) and prior to circling (65%) the predator, as well as during circling (58%) and for high alert inspection of the predator (72%). The researchers commented that "mobbing and perhaps circling are agonistic responses controlled by the LE[left eye]/right hemisphere, as also seen in other species. Alert inspection involves detailed examination of the predator and likely high levels of fear, known to be right hemisphere function."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Koboroff, A., Kaplan, G. and Rogers, L.J.|year=2008|title=Hemispheric specialization in Australian magpies (Gymnorhina tibicen) shown as eye preferences during response to a predator|journal=Brain Research Bulletin|volume=76|issue=3|pages=304–306|doi=10.1016/j.brainresbull.2008.02.015|pmid=18498946}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Yellow-legged gull]] (''Larus michahellis'') chicks show laterality when reverting from a supine to prone posture, and also in pecking at a dummy parental bill to beg for food. Lateralization occurs at both the population and individual level in the reverting response and at the individual level in begging. Females have a leftward preference in the righting response, indicating this is sex dependent. Laterality in the begging response in chicks varies according to laying order and matches variation in egg [[androgen]]s concentration.

===In fish===
Laterality determines the organisation of rainbowfish (''Melanotaenia'' spp.) schools.  These fish demonstrate an individual eye preference when examining their reflection in a mirror.  Fish which show a right-eye preference in the mirror test prefer to be on the left side of the school. Conversely, fish that show a left-eye preference in the mirror test or were non-lateralised, prefer to be slightly to the right side of the school. The behaviour depends on the species and sex of the school.&lt;ref name="Bibost"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Bibost, A-L.  |author2=Brown, C.|year=2013|title=Laterality enhances schooling position in rainbowfish, Melaotaenia spp|journal=PLOS ONE|volume=8|issue=11|pages=e80907|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0080907|pmid=24260506|pmc=3829960|bibcode=2013PLoSO...880907B}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In amphibians===
Three species of toads, the [[common toad]] (''Bufo bufo''), [[Bufo viridis|green toad]] (''Bufo viridis'') and the [[cane toad]] (''Bufo marinus'') show stronger escape and defensive responses when a model predator was placed on the toad's left side compared to their right side.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Lippolis, G., Bisazza, A., Rogers, L.

[[File:Dancer sculpture by Degas at the Met.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A photograph of the sculpture]]
'''''The Little Fourteen-Year-Old Dancer''''' (French: ''La Petite Danseuse de Quatorze Ans'')  is a sculpture begun c. 1880 by [[Edgar Degas]] of a young student of the [[Paris Opera Ballet]] dance school, a Belgian named [[Marie van Goethem]].

==Description==
The sculpture is one-third life size and was originally sculpted in wax, a somewhat unusual choice of medium for the time. It is dressed in a real [[bodice]], [[tutu (clothing)|tutu]] and [[ballet slippers]] and has a wig of real hair. All but a hair ribbon and the tutu are covered in wax. The 28 bronze repetitions that appear in museums and galleries around the world today were cast after Degas' death.  The tutus worn by the bronzes vary from museum to museum.

The exact relationship between [[Marie van Goethem]] and Edgar Degas is a matter of debate. It was common in 1880 for the "Petits Rats" of the Paris Opera to seek protectors from among the wealthy visitors at the back door of the opera.

Realistic wax figures with real hair and real clothes had also been popular in religious, Folk, and fine arts for centuries before Degas created his ''Little Dancer''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Degas Sculptures|last=Joseph Czestochowski and Anne Pingeot|first=|last2=Reff|first2=Theodore|publisher=Torch Press|year=2002|isbn=|location=Memphis|pages=52–3|chapter=To Make Sculpture Modern}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Degas and the Little Dancer|last=Kendall|first=Richard|publisher=Yale University Press|year=1998|isbn=|location=|pages=32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The arms are taut, and the legs and feet are placed in a ballet position akin to fourth position at rest, and there is tension in the pose, an image of a ballerina being put through her paces, not posing in an angelic way. Her face is – "contorted, people thought it was a deliberate image of ugliness, but you could also say it's the image of a sickly gawky adolesecent who is being made to do something she doesn't totally want to do."&lt;ref&gt;[[Tim Marlow]] on... Degas, Sickert &amp; Toulouse-Lautrec' Channel 5 TV&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Edgar Degas La Petite Danseuse de Quatorze Ans cast in 1997.jpg|thumb|left|160px|Angle from "The Complete Sculptures of Edgar Degas" collection at [[M.T. Abraham Foundation]], cast in 1997. Note the varying tutu.]]When the ''La Petite Danseuse de Quatorze Ans'' was shown in Paris at the Sixth Impressionist Exhibition of 1881, it received mixed reviews. [[Joris-Karl Huysmans]] called it "the first truly modern attempt at sculpture I know." Certain critics were shocked by the piece, and the dancer was compared to a monkey and an [[Aztec]]. One critic, Paul Mantz, called her the "flower of precocious depravity," with a face "marked by the hateful promise of every vice" and "bearing the signs of a profoundly heinous character."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | date=2011-11-02 | url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1998-10-11/features/1998284216_1_classical-sculpture-original-sculpture-dancer | title=Degas's Little Dancer is still on the point of controversy}}&lt;/ref&gt; Comparisons with older art were made, perhaps partly because it was exhibited in a glass case, like classical sculpture in the [[Louvre]], and was dressed in wig and clothes.

After Degas' death, his heirs (brother and sister's children&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | date=2011-11-02 | url=http://www.nga.gov/content/ngaweb/Collection/highlights/highlight110292.html | title=National Gallery of Art}}&lt;/ref&gt;) made the decision to have the bronze repetitions of ''Le Petite Danseuse'' and other wax and mixed-media sculptures cast. The casting took place at the Hébrard foundry in Paris from 1920 until 1936 when the Hébrard foundry went bankrupt and closed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Degas Sculptures|last=Joseph Czestochowski and Anne Pingeot|first=|last2=Pingeot|first2=Anne|publisher=Torch Press|year=2002|isbn=|location=Memphis|pages=34|chapter=Degas and His Castings}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thereafter, "Hébrard" Degas ''Little Dancer'' bronzes were cast at the Valsuani foundry in Paris until the mid-1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Degas’ Little Dancer, Aged Fourteen: The earlier version that helped spark the birth of modern art|last=Hedberg|first=Gregory|publisher=Arnoldsche Fine Art Publishers|year=2016|isbn=|location=|pages=10, 19, 28 n. 6–7, 30 n. 44, 74, 99 n. 221, 272–281}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sixty-nine of Degas' wax sculptures survived the casting process. One copy of ''Le Petite Danseuse'' is currently owned by the creator and owner of [[Auto Trader Group|Auto Trader]], [[John Madejski]]. He stated that he bought the sculpture by accident.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} That copy was sold for £13,257,250 ($19,077,250) at [[Sotheby's]] on February, 3rd 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | date=2009-02-04 | url=http://www.artvalue.com/sale--9928--Sotheby-s-London-New-Bond-Street-L09601-Impressionist-Modern.htm | title=Auction results}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another Hébrard ''Little Dancer'' bronze failed to sell at a November 2011 auction at [[Christie's]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | date=2011-11-02 | url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/g/a/2011/11/02/bloomberg_articlesLU0CEK07SXKX.DTL | title=Degas Ballerina Fails to Sell at Christie's as Markets Plummet}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To construct the statue, Degas used pigmented beeswax, with a metal armature, rope, and paintbrushes covered by clay for structural support.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Edgar Degas Sculpture: The Collections of the National Gallery of Art, Systematic Catalogue|last=Suzanne G. Lindsay, Daphne S. Barbour, and Shelley G. Sturman|first=|publisher=National Gallery of Art|year=2010|isbn=|location=Washington, D.C.|pages=116–119}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Little Dancer'' wax sculpture we see today is a reworked version of the original sculpture that was shown in 1881. After seeing the wax sculpture in Degas’ living quarters in April 1903, the New York collector Louisine Havemeyer expressed interest in buying the wax. After proposing a bronze or cast wax of the sculpture, which Mrs. Havemeyer refused, Degas took his wax figure upstairs to his working studio and told Vollard he was reworking the sculpture for Havemeyer for 40,000 francs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Private Collection of Edgar Degas|last=Ann Dumas, Colta Ives, Susan Alyson Stein, and Gary Tinterow|first=|last2=Tinterow|first2=Gary|publisher=The Metropolitan Museum of Art|year=1997|isbn=|location=New York|pages=101|chapter=Appendix: Mary Cassatt on the Degas Sales and the Casting of Sculpture}}&lt;/ref&gt; Degas never sold the sculpture to Mrs. Havemeyer. After Degas died, it was found in a corner of his studio. Paul Lefond, Degas’ biographer, described the ''Little Dancer'' wax after Degas’ death as "nothing but a ruin;"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Degas, vol. II|last=Lafond|first=Paul|publisher=H. Floury|year=1918–19|isbn=|location=Paris|pages=66}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Mary Cassatt telegraphed Mrs. Havemeyer "Statue Bad Condition."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Degas|last=Jean Sutherland Boggs, Douglas W.

It is Degas' reworked second version of his wax figure. At some point before Degas extensively reworked his sculpture, he allowed a plaster to be cast from the wax figure. This recently re-discovered plaster records the ''Little Dancer''’s original pose, bodice, and hairdo. The plaster is now in a private collection in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Degas’ Little Dancer, Aged Fourteen: The earlier version that helped spark the birth of modern art|last=Hedberg|first=Gregory|publisher=Arnoldsche|year=2016|isbn=|location=|pages=10–64}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The original wax sculpture was acquired by [[Paul Mellon]] in 1956. Beginning in 1985, Mr and Mrs Mellon gave the [[National Gallery of Art]] 49 Degas waxes, 10 bronzes and 2 plasters, the largest group of original Degas sculptures. ''Little Dancer'' was among the bequests. In 1997, the Airaindor-Valsuani foundry in France began casting a limited edition of Degas bronzes from the pre-1903 ''Little Dancer'' plaster. One such ''Little Dancer'' bronze is owned by the [[M.T. Abraham Foundation]], which, at times, is lent to other institutions and museums including the State Hermitage Museum in Saint Petersburg, Russia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Edgar Degas: Figures in Motion|last=Mikhail B. Piotrovsky, Amir Gross Kabiri, Geraldine Norman, Jon Whiteley, June Hargrove, and Dalit Lahav-Durst|first=|publisher=Petronius Publishing House, Ltd.|year=2013|isbn=|location=St. Petersburg|pages=65}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like the various states of many of Degas' prints, the Valsuani bronzes record the first version of Degas' ''Little Dancer'', while the Hébrard casts record the second and final state of the sculpture.

The '''Mailiao Power Plant''' ({{zh|c=麥寮電廠|p=Màiliáo Diànchǎng}}) is a [[coal-fired power plant]] in [[Mailiao|Mailiao Township]], [[Yunlin County]], [[Taiwan]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gibsin.com.tw/old/Case-MailiaoFPP.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; With a total installed capacity of 4,200 MW,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://globalenergyobservatory.org/geoid/4138 |title=Mai-Liao (Mailiao) Coal Power Plant - GEO |publisher=Globalenergyobservatory.org |date=2010-02-15 |accessdate=2014-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; the plant is Taiwan's third largest coal-fired power plant after [[Taichung Power Plant]] and [[Hsinta Power Plant]].

==History==
The groundbreaking ceremony for the power plant construction was held on 12 December 1996. Invited to the ceremony were [[List of vice premiers of the Republic of China|Vice Premier]] [[Hsu Li-teh]], [[Ministry of Economic Affairs (Taiwan)|Minister of Economic Affairs]] [[Wang Chih-kang]] and [[President of the Legislative Yuan|President]] of [[Legislative Yuan]] [[Liu Sung-pan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://taiwaninfo.nat.gov.tw/ct.asp?xItem=14816&amp;CtNode=103&amp;htx_TRCategory=&amp;mp=4 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-12-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141210104641/http://taiwaninfo.nat.gov.tw/ct.asp?xItem=14816&amp;CtNode=103&amp;htx_TRCategory=&amp;mp=4 |archivedate=2014-12-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Commissioned in June 1999 for its first two units, the power plant is the first [[independent power producer]] power plant after [[Taipower]] ended the electricity supply monopoly in Taiwan in 1994.&lt;ref name="gibsin1"&gt;http://www.gibsin.com.tw/old/case-mailiaofpp.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fpg.com.tw/html/eng/no6.htm |title=FPG |publisher=FPG |date= |accessdate=2014-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ownership==
The power plant is owned by the [[Mai-Liao Power Corporation]] (MPC) and [[Formosa Petrochemical Corporation]] (FPCC).

==Generation units==
The power plant consists of five 600 MW pulverized coal-fired units owned by the MPC and two 600 MW pulverized coal-fired co-generation units owned by the FPCC. The plant is designed for base load service with the capability for daily startup and shutdown operation per instructions from [[Taipower]]'s dispatcher center.

==Components==
The [[Coal preparation plant|coal handling system]] of the power plant has a truck unloading station capacity of 600 tonnes/hour and its flexible sidewall conveyor capacity of 800 tonnes/hour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kingtechengineer.com/?page_id=75 |title=FPCC Mailiao Power Plant Coal Handling System &amp;#124; KINGTECH Engineering |publisher=Kingtechengineer.com |date= |accessdate=2014-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The coal is stored in coal domes in which each dome is 120 meter in diameter, 60 meter in height and 180,000 tons in capacity.&lt;ref name="gibsin1"/&gt;

==Events==

===2012===
On 20 June 2012 at 11:55 am, the power plant tripped during the [[2012 Pacific typhoon season|Tropical Storm Talim]]. This caused the shut down of 54 out of 66 units of the Yunlin petrochemical complex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/biz/archives/2012/06/21/2003535843 |title=FPG’s Yunlin plants back online after power outage |publisher=Taipei Times |date=2014-04-24 |accessdate=2014-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2016===
On 1 August 2016, a generating unit of the power plant broke down, disrupting the supply of power.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.chinapost.com.tw/taiwan/2016/08/02/474162/Orange-alert.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

===2017===
On 7 October 2017, the no. 1 generation unit of the power plant was shut down due to pipe rupture, causing 600 MW of power loss.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://focustaiwan.tw/news/aeco/201710080014.aspx|date=8 October 2017|first1=Ya-chuan|last1=Huang|first2=Elizabeth|last2=Hsu|title=Mailiao power plant down one generator due to equipment problem|publisher=Focus Taiwan|accessdate=9 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Murlen National Park is at Murlen Village, which is the Village of Saithuama Sailo, Chief of Hnahlan. It is a part of Hnahlan Village. Murlen National Park was declared in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=List of National Parks in India|url=http://ces.iisc.ernet.in/envis/sdev/parks.htm|publisher=Centre for Ecological Sciences Indian Institute of Science|accessdate=22 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Flora==
Only about 1% of the sun’s ray can penetrate the forest on a sunny day. So the thickness of the forest in the park is generally compared to the forest found in the Amazon region in South America. Some of the trees found in the park are as old as 350 years. There is an area in the park where not even a single sun’s ray can penetrate. And for this reason the area has been known as ‘losing area of seven fellow-men’ or land of no return.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Murlen National Park and the Losing Area of Seven Fellow-Men|url=http://www.india-north-east.com/2010/09/murlen-national-park-and-losing-area-of.html|publisher=India-north-east.com|accessdate=22 August 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130617175333/http://www.india-north-east.com/2010/09/murlen-national-park-and-losing-area-of.html|archivedate=17 June 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The vegetation is admixture of ''[[Quercus]]'', ''[[Schima wallichii]]'', ''[[Betula]]'', ''[[Michelia champaca]]'', ''[[Pinus kesiya]]'', ''[[Prunus]]'', ''[[Myrica]]'', ''[[Rhododendron]]'', ''[[Chimonobambusa callosa]]'', [[Arundo|cane]]s and a variety of [[orchid]]s and [[lichens]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Logesh|title=Studies on Lichens of Mizoram, Northeast India|year=2015|publisher=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, India Section B: Biological Sciences|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs40011-015-0592-z|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[physics]], the '''Navier–Stokes equations''' ({{IPAc-en|n|æ|v|ˈ|j|eː|_|s|t|əʊ|k|s}}), named after [[Claude-Louis Navier]] and [[Sir George Stokes, 1st Baronet|George Gabriel Stokes]], describe the motion of [[viscous fluid]] substances.

These balance equations arise from applying [[Newton's second law|Isaac Newton's second law]] to [[Fluid dynamics|fluid motion]], together with the assumption that the [[stress (mechanics)|stress]] in the fluid is the sum of a [[diffusion|diffusing]] [[viscosity|viscous]] term (proportional to the [[gradient]] of velocity) and a [[pressure]] term—hence describing ''viscous flow''. The main difference between them and the simpler [[Euler equations (fluid dynamics)|Euler equations]] for [[inviscid flow]] is that Navier–Stokes equations also factor in the [[Froude number|Froude limit]] (no external field) and are not [[conservation law|conservation equations]], but rather a [[dissipative system]], in the sense that they cannot be put into the quasilinear [[Homogeneous polynomial|homogeneous]] form:

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf y_t + \mathbf A(\mathbf y) \mathbf y_x = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

Navier–Stokes equations are useful because they describe the physics of many phenomena of [[scientific]] and [[engineering]] interest. They may be used to [[model (abstract)|model]] the weather, [[ocean current]]s, water [[flow conditioning|flow in a pipe]] and air flow around a [[airfoil|wing]]. The Navier–Stokes equations, in their full and simplified forms, help with the design of aircraft and cars, the study of blood flow, the design of power stations, the analysis of pollution, and many other things. Coupled with [[Maxwell's equations]], they can be used to model and study [[magnetohydrodynamics]].

The Navier–Stokes equations are also of great interest in a purely mathematical sense. Despite their wide range of practical uses, it has not yet been proven whether solutions always [[Existence theorem|exist]] in three dimensions and, if they do exist, whether they are [[Smoothness|smooth]] – i.e. they are infinitely differentiable at all points in the [[Domain (mathematical analysis)|domain]]. These are called the [[Navier–Stokes existence and smoothness]] problems. The [[Clay Mathematics Institute]] has called this one of the [[Millennium Prize Problems|seven most important open problems in mathematics]] and has offered a [[US$]]1&amp;nbsp;million prize for a solution or a counterexample.&lt;ref&gt;

==Flow velocity==
The solution of the Navier–Stokes equations is a [[flow velocity]]. It is a field, since it is defined at every point in a region of space and an interval of time. Once the velocity field is calculated other quantities of interest, such as [[pressure]] or [[temperature]], may be found using additional equations and relations. This is different from what one normally sees in [[classical mechanics]], where solutions are typically trajectories of position of a [[particle]] or deflection of a [[Continuum (theory)|continuum]]. Studying velocity instead of position makes more sense for a fluid; however for visualization purposes one can compute various [[Streamlines, streaklines, and pathlines|trajectories]].

==General continuum equations==
{{Main|Derivation of the Navier–Stokes equations}}
{{see also|Cauchy momentum equation#Conservation form}}

The Navier–Stokes momentum equation can be derived as a particular form of the [[Cauchy momentum equation]], whose general convective form is
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{D \mathbf{u}}{D t} = \frac 1 \rho \nabla \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} + \mathbf{g}&lt;/math&gt;
By setting the [[Cauchy stress tensor]] &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol\sigma&lt;/math&gt; to be the sum of a viscosity term &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol\tau&lt;/math&gt; (the [[Cauchy stress tensor#Stress deviator tensor|deviatoric stress]]) and a pressure term &lt;math&gt;-p\mathbf{I}&lt;/math&gt; (volumetric stress) we arrive at

{{Equation box 1
|indent=:
|title='''Cauchy momentum equation''' ''(convective form)''
|equation=&lt;math&gt;
\rho\frac{D\mathbf{u}}{Dt} = - \nabla p + \nabla \cdot \boldsymbol \tau + \rho\,\mathbf{g}
&lt;/math&gt;
|cellpadding
|border
|border colour = #50C878
|background colour = #ECFCF4
}}

where
* &lt;math&gt;\frac{D}{Dt}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[convective derivative]],
* &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; is the density,
* {{math|'''u'''}} is the flow velocity,
* &lt;math&gt;\nabla\cdot&lt;/math&gt; is the [[divergence]],
* {{math|''p''}} is the [[pressure]],
* {{math|''t''}} is [[time]],
* &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol\tau&lt;/math&gt; is the deviatoric stress tensor, which has order two,
* {{math|'''g'''}} represents [[body force|body acceleration]]s acting on the continuum, for example [[gravity]], [[Fictitious force|inertial accelerations]], [[Coulomb's law|electrostatic accelerations]], and so on,

In this form, it is apparent that in the assumption of an inviscid fluid -no deviatoric stress- Cauchy equations reduce to the [[Euler equations (fluid dynamics)|Euler equations]].

Assuming [[conservation of mass]] we can use the [[Continuity equation#Differential form|continuity equation]], &lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t} + \nabla \cdot (\rho\,\mathbf{u}) = 0&lt;/math&gt; to arrive to the conservation form of the equations of motion. This is often written:&lt;ref&gt;Batchelor (1967) pp. 137 &amp; 142.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Equation box 1
|indent=:
|title='''Cauchy momentum equation''' ''(conservation form)''
|equation=&lt;math&gt;
\frac {\partial}{\partial t} (\rho\,\mathbf{u})
   + \nabla \cdot (\rho\,\mathbf{u} \otimes \mathbf{u})
 = - \nabla p + \nabla \cdot \boldsymbol \tau + \rho\,\mathbf{g}
&lt;/math&gt;
|cellpadding
|border
|border colour = #50C878
|background colour = #ECFCF4
}}

where {{math|⊗}} is the [[outer product]]:
::&lt;math&gt;\mathbf u \otimes \mathbf v = \mathbf u \mathbf v^{\mathrm T}.&lt;/math&gt;

The left side of the equation describes acceleration, and may be composed of time-dependent and convective components (also the effects of non-inertial coordinates if present). The right side of the equation is in effect a summation of hydrostatic effects, the divergence of deviatoric stress and body forces (such as gravity).

All non-relativistic balance equations, such as the Navier–Stokes equations, can be derived by beginning with the Cauchy equations and specifying the stress tensor through a [[constitutive relation]]. By expressing the deviatoric (shear) stress tensor in terms of [[viscosity]] and the fluid [[Shear velocity|velocity]] gradient, and assuming constant viscosity, the above Cauchy equations will lead to the Navier–Stokes equations below.

===Convective acceleration===
{{see also|Cauchy momentum equation#Convective acceleration}}
[[Image:ConvectiveAcceleration vectorized.svg|thumb|An example of convection. Though the flow may be steady (time-independent), the fluid decelerates as it moves down the diverging duct (assuming incompressible or subsonic compressible flow), hence there is an acceleration happening over position.]]

A significant feature of the Cauchy equation and consequently all other continuum equations (including Euler and Navier–Stokes) is the presence of convective acceleration: the effect of acceleration of a flow with respect to space. While individual fluid particles indeed experience time-dependent acceleration, the convective acceleration of the flow field is a spatial effect, one example being fluid speeding up in a nozzle.

==Compressible flow==
Remark: here, the Cauchy stress tensor is denoted &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol\sigma&lt;/math&gt; (instead of &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol\tau&lt;/math&gt; as it was in the [[#General_continuum_equations|general continuum equations]] and in the [[#Incompressible_flow|incompressible flow section]]).

The compressible momentum Navier–Stokes equation results from the following assumptions on the Cauchy stress tensor:&lt;ref name="Batchelor_142_148"/&gt;

*the stress is '''[[Galilean invariance|Galileian invariant]]''': it does not depend directly on the flow velocity, but only on spatial derivatives of the flow velocity. So the stress variable is the tensor gradient {{math|∇'''u'''.}}
*the stress is '''linear''' in this variable: {{math|'''σ'''(∇'''u''') {{=}} '''C''' : (∇'''u'''),}} where {{math|'''C'''}} is the fourth-order tensor representing the constant of proportionality, called the viscosity or [[elasticity tensor]], and : is the [[Dyadics#Double-dot product|double-dot product]].
*the fluid is assumed to be [[isotropic]], as with gases and simple liquids, and consequently {{math|'''V'''}} is an isotropic tensor; furthermore, since the stress tensor is symmetric, by [[Helmholtz decomposition]] it can be expressed in terms of two scalar [[Lamé parameters]], the [[bulk viscosity]] {{mvar|λ}} and the [[dynamic viscosity]] {{mvar|μ}}, as it is usual in [[linear elasticity]]:

{{Equation box 1
|indent=::
|title='''Linear stress [[constitutive equation]]''' ''(expression used for elastic solid)''
|equation=:&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol \sigma = \lambda (\nabla\cdot\mathbf{u}) \mathbf I + 2 \mu \boldsymbol \varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;
|cellpadding
|border
|border colour = #FF0000
|background colour = #ECFCF4
}}

: where {{math|'''I'''}} is the identity tensor, {{math|'''ε'''(∇'''u''') ≡ {{sfrac|2}}∇'''u''' + {{sfrac|2}}(∇'''u''')&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt;}} is the rate-of-[[strain tensor]] and {{math|∇ · '''u'''}} is the rate of expansion of the flow. So this decomposition can be explicited as:

:: &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol \sigma = \lambda (\nabla\cdot\mathbf{u}) \mathbf I + \mu \left(\nabla\mathbf{u} + ( \nabla\mathbf{u} )^\mathrm{T}\right).&lt;/math&gt;

Since the [[trace (linear algebra)|trace]] of the rate-of-strain tensor in three dimensions is:

: &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{tr} (\boldsymbol \varepsilon) = \nabla\cdot\mathbf{u}.&lt;/math&gt;

The trace of the stress tensor in three dimensions becomes:

: &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{tr} (\boldsymbol \sigma) = (3 \lambda + 2 \mu )\nabla\cdot\mathbf{u}.&lt;/math&gt;

So by alternatively decomposing the stress tensor into '''isotropic''' and '''deviatoric''' parts, as usual in fluid dynamics:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Chorin |first1=Alexandre E. |last2=Marsden |first2=Jerrold E. |date=1993 |title=A Mathematical Introduction to Fluid Mechanics |page=33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol \sigma = \left(\lambda + \tfrac23 \mu\right) \left(\nabla\cdot\mathbf{u}\right)\mathbf I + \mu \left(\nabla\mathbf{u} + \left( \nabla\mathbf{u} \right)^\mathrm{T} - \tfrac23 \left(\nabla\cdot\mathbf{u}\right)\mathbf I\right)&lt;/math&gt;

Introducing the [[volume viscosity|second viscosity]] {{mvar|ζ}},

: &lt;math&gt; \zeta \equiv \lambda + \tfrac23 \mu ,&lt;/math&gt;

we arrive to the linear [[constitutive equation]] in the form usually employed in [[thermal hydraulics]]:&lt;ref name=Batchelor_142_148/&gt;

Both second viscosity {{mvar|ζ}} and dynamic viscosity {{mvar|μ}} need not be constant – in general, they depend on density, on each other (the viscosity is expressed in pressure), and in compressible flows also on temperature. Any equation expliciting one of these [[transport coefficient]] in the [[conservation variable]]s is called an [[equation of state]].&lt;ref name="Batchelor 1967 p. 165"/&gt;

By computing the divergence of the stress tensor, since the divergence of tensor {{math|∇'''u''' }} is {{math|∇&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;'''u''' }} and the divergence of tensor {{math|(∇'''u''')&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt;}} is {{math| ∇(∇ · '''u''')}}, one finally arrives to the compressible (most general) Navier–Stokes momentum equation:&lt;ref&gt;Batchelor (1967) pp. 147 &amp; 154.&lt;/ref&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;D/Dt&lt;/math&gt; is the [[material derivative]].
Bulk viscosity is assumed to be constant, otherwise it should not be taken out of the last derivative. The effect of the volume viscosity {{mvar|ζ}} is that the mechanical pressure is not equivalent to the thermodynamic [[pressure]]:&lt;ref&gt;Landau &amp; Lifshitz (1987) pp. 44–45, 196&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; \bar{p} \equiv p - \zeta \, \nabla \cdot \mathbf{u} ,&lt;/math&gt;

This difference is usually neglected, sometimes by explicitly assuming {{math|''ζ'' {{=}} 0}}, but it could have an impact in sound absorption and attenuation and shock waves.&lt;ref&gt;White (2006) p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt; The convective acceleration term can also be written as

: &lt;math&gt; \mathbf u\cdot\nabla\mathbf u = (\nabla\times\mathbf u)\times\mathbf u + \frac{1}{2}\nabla\mathbf u^2&lt;/math&gt;,

where the vector &lt;math&gt;(\nabla\times\mathbf u)\times\mathbf u&lt;/math&gt; is known as the [[Lamb vector]].

For the special case of an [[incompressible flow]], the pressure constrains the flow so that the volume of [[fluid element]]s is constant: [[isochoric process|isochoric flow]] resulting in a [[Solenoidal vector field|solenoidal]] velocity field with {{math|∇ · '''u''' {{=}} 0.}}&lt;ref&gt;Batchelor (1967) p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Incompressible flow==
The incompressible momentum Navier–Stokes equation results from the following assumptions on the Cauchy stress tensor:&lt;ref name=Batchelor_142_148&gt;Batchelor (1967) pp. 142–148.&lt;/ref&gt;

*the stress is '''[[Galilean invariance|Galilean invariant]]''': it does not depend directly on the flow velocity, but only on spatial derivatives of the flow velocity. So the stress variable is the tensor gradient {{math|∇'''u'''}}.
*the fluid is assumed to be [[isotropic]], as with gases and simple liquids, and consequently {{math|'''τ'''}} is an isotropic tensor; furthermore, since the deviatoric stress tensor can be expressed in terms of the [[dynamic viscosity]] {{mvar|μ}}:

{{Equation box 1

::&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\varepsilon} = \frac{1}{2} \left( \mathbf{\nabla u} + \mathbf{\nabla u}^\mathrm{T} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

Dynamic viscosity {{mvar|μ}} need not be constant – in incompressible flows it can depend on density and on pressure. Any equation expliciting one of these [[transport coefficient]] in the [[conservative variable]]s is called an [[equation of state]].&lt;ref name="Batchelor 1967 p. 165"&gt;Batchelor (1967) p. 165.&lt;/ref&gt;

The divergence of the deviatoric stress is given by:

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla \cdot \boldsymbol \tau = 2 \mu \nabla \cdot \boldsymbol \varepsilon = \mu \nabla \cdot \left( \nabla\mathbf{u} + \nabla\mathbf{u} ^\mathrm{T} \right) = \mu \, \nabla^2 \mathbf{u}&lt;/math&gt;

because &lt;math&gt;\nabla\cdot \mathbf{u}=0&lt;/math&gt; for an incompressible fluid.
Incompressibility rules out density and pressure waves like sound or [[shock wave]]s, so this simplification is not useful if these phenomena are of interest. The incompressible flow assumption typically holds well with all fluids at low [[Mach number]]s (say up to about Mach 0.3), such as for modelling air winds at normal temperatures.&lt;ref name="Ach"&gt;See Acheson (1990).&lt;/ref&gt; For incompressible (uniform density ρ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) flows the following identity holds:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac 1 {\rho_0} \nabla p = \nabla \left(\frac p {\rho_0} \right) \equiv \nabla w&lt;/math&gt;

where {{mvar|w}} is the specific (with the sense of ''per unit mass'') [[thermodynamic work]], the internal source term. Then the incompressible Navier–Stokes equations are best visualised by dividing for the density:

{{Equation box 1
|indent=:
|title='''[[Incompressible flow|Incompressible]] Navier–Stokes equations''' (''convective form'')
|equation=&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial \mathbf{u}}{\partial t} + (\mathbf{u} \cdot \nabla) \mathbf{u} - \nu \,\nabla^2 \mathbf{u} = - \nabla w + \mathbf{g}.&lt;/math&gt;

{{hidden
| A laminar flow example |
Velocity profile (laminar flow):

:&lt;math&gt;u(x) = 0, \quad u(y) = u, \quad u(z) = 0&lt;/math&gt;

for the {{mvar|y}}-direction, simplify the Navier–Stokes equation:

:&lt;math&gt;0 = -\frac{dP}{dx} + \mu\left(\frac{d^2u}{dy^2}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

Integrate twice to find the velocity profile with boundary conditions {{math|''y'' {{=}} ''h''}}, {{math|''u'' {{=}} 0}}, {{math|''y'' {{=}} −''h''}}, {{math|''u'' {{=}} 0}}:

:&lt;math&gt;u = \frac{1}{2\mu}\frac{dP}{dx} y^2 + Ay + B&lt;/math&gt;

From this equation, substitute in the two boundary conditions to get two equations:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align} 0 &amp;= \frac{1}{2 \mu}\frac{dP}{dx} h^2 + Ah + B \\ 0 &amp;= \frac{1}{2 \mu}\frac{dP}{dx} h^2 - Ah + B \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Add and solve for {{mvar|B}}:

:&lt;math&gt;B = -\frac{1}{2 \mu}\frac{dP}{dx} h^2&lt;/math&gt;

Substitute and solve for {{mvar|A}}:

:&lt;math&gt;A = 0&lt;/math&gt;

Finally this gives the velocity profile:

:&lt;math&gt;u = \frac{1}{2 \mu}\frac{dP}{dx} (y^2 - h^2)&lt;/math&gt;
}}

It is well worth observing the meaning of each term (compare to the [[Cauchy momentum equation]]):

:&lt;math&gt;
 \overbrace{
 \underbrace{\frac{\partial \mathbf{u}}{\partial t}}_{
 \begin{smallmatrix}
 \text{Variation}
 \end{smallmatrix}} +
 \underbrace{(\mathbf{u} \cdot \nabla) \mathbf{u}}_{
 \begin{smallmatrix}
 \text{Convection}
 \end{smallmatrix}}}^{\text{Inertia (per volume)}}
 \overbrace{-\underbrace{\nu \, \nabla^2 \mathbf{u}}_{\text{Diffusion}}=
 \underbrace{-\nabla w}_{
 \begin{smallmatrix}
 \text{Internal} \\
 \text{source}
 \end{smallmatrix}}}^{\text{Divergence of stress}} +
 \underbrace{\mathbf{g}}_{
 \begin{smallmatrix}
 \text{External} \\
 \text{source}
 \end{smallmatrix}}
 .
&lt;/math&gt;

The higher-order term, namely the [[shear stress]] divergence {{math|∇ · ''τ''}}, has simply reduced to the [[vector laplacian]] term {{math|''μ''∇&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;'''u'''}}.&lt;ref&gt;Batchelor (1967) pp. 21 &amp; 147.&lt;/ref&gt; This laplacian term can be interpreted as the difference between the velocity at a point and the mean velocity in a small surrounding volume. This implies that – for a Newtonian fluid – viscosity operates as a ''diffusion of momentum'', in much the same way as the [[heat conduction]]. In fact neglecting the convection term, incompressible Navier–Stokes equations lead to a vector [[diffusion equation]] (namely [[Stokes flow|Stokes equations]]), but in general the convection term is present, so incompressible Navier–Stokes equations belong to the class of [[convection-diffusion equation]]s.

In the usual case of an external field being a [[conservative field]]:

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf g = - \nabla \phi &lt;/math&gt;

by defining the [[hydraulic head]]:

:&lt;math&gt;h \equiv w + \phi &lt;/math&gt;

one can finally condense the whole source in one term, arriving to the incompressible Navier–Stokes equation with conservative external field:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial \mathbf{u}}{\partial t} + (\mathbf{u} \cdot \nabla) \mathbf{u} - \nu \, \nabla^2 \mathbf{u} = - \nabla h.&lt;/math&gt;

The incompressible Navier–Stokes equations with conservative external field is the '''fundamental equation of [[hydraulics]]'''. The domain for these equations is commonly a 3 or less [[Euclidean space]], for which an [[orthogonal coordinate]] reference frame is usually set to explicit the system of scalar partial differential equations to be solved. In 3D orthogonal coordinate systems are 3: [[Cartesian coordinate system|Cartesian]], [[Cylindrical coordinate system|cylindrical]], and [[Spherical coordinate system|spherical]]. Expressing the Navier–Stokes vector equation in Cartesian coordinates is quite straightforward and not much influenced by the number of dimensions of the euclidean space employed, and this is the case also for the first-order terms (like the variation and convection ones) also in non-cartesian orthogonal coordinate systems. But for the higher order terms (the two coming from the divergence of the deviatoric stress that distinguish Navier–Stokes equations from Euler equations) some [[tensor calculus]] is required for deducing an expression in non-cartesian orthogonal coordinate systems.

The incompressible Navier–Stokes equation is composite, the sum of two orthogonal equations,
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\frac{\partial\mathbf{u}}{\partial t} &amp;= \Pi^S\left(-(\mathbf{u}\cdot\nabla)\mathbf{u} + \nu\,\nabla^2\mathbf{u}\right) + \mathbf{f}^S \\
\rho^{-1}\,\nabla p &amp;= \Pi^I\left(-(\mathbf{u}\cdot\nabla)\mathbf{u} + \nu\,\nabla^2\mathbf{u}\right) + \mathbf{f}^I
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|Π&lt;sup&gt;''S''&lt;/sup&gt;}} and {{math|Π&lt;sup&gt;''I''&lt;/sup&gt;}} are solenoidal and irrotational projection operators satisfying {{math|Π&lt;sup&gt;''S''&lt;/sup&gt; + Π&lt;sup&gt;''I''&lt;/sup&gt; {{=}} 1}} and {{math|'''f'''&lt;sup&gt;''S''&lt;/sup&gt;}} and {{math|'''f'''&lt;sup&gt;''I''&lt;/sup&gt;}} are the non-conservative and conservative parts of the body force. This result follows from the [[Helmholtz decomposition|Helmholtz Theorem]] (also known as the fundamental theorem of vector calculus). The first equation is a pressureless governing equation for the velocity, while the second equation for the pressure is a functional of the velocity and is related to the pressure Poisson equation.

The explicit functional form of the projection operator in 3D is found from the Helmholtz Theorem:

:&lt;math&gt;\Pi^S\,\mathbf{F}(\mathbf{r}) = \frac{1}{4\pi}\nabla\times\int \frac{\nabla^\prime\times\mathbf{F}(\mathbf{r}')}{|\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}'|} d V', \quad \Pi^I = 1-\Pi^S&lt;/math&gt;

with a similar structure in 2D. Thus the governing equation is an [[integro-differential equation]] similar to [[Coulomb law|Coulomb]] and [[Biot-Savart law]], not convenient for numerical computation.

An equivalent weak or variational form of the equation, proved to produce the same velocity solution as the Navier–Stokes equation,&lt;ref&gt;

for divergence-free test functions {{math|'''w'''}} satisfying appropriate boundary conditions. Here, the projections are accomplished by the orthogonality of the solenoidal and irrotational function spaces. The discrete form of this is eminently suited to finite element computation of divergence-free flow, as we shall see in the next section. There one will be able to address the question "How does one specify pressure-driven (Poiseuille) problems with a pressureless governing equation?".

The absence of pressure forces from the governing velocity equation demonstrates that the equation is not a dynamic one, but rather a kinematic equation where the divergence-free condition serves the role of a conservation equation. This all would seem to refute the frequent statements that the incompressible pressure enforces the divergence-free condition.

===Discrete velocity===
With partitioning of the problem domain and defining [[basis function]]s on the partitioned domain, the discrete form of the governing equation is,
:&lt;math&gt;\left(\mathbf{w}_i, \frac{\partial\mathbf{u}_j}{\partial t}\right) = -\left(\mathbf{w}_i, (\mathbf{u}\cdot\nabla)\mathbf{u}_j\right) - \nu(\nabla\mathbf{w}_i: \nabla\mathbf{u}_j) + \left(\mathbf{w}_i, \mathbf{f}^S\right).&lt;/math&gt;

It is desirable to choose basis functions which reflect the essential feature of incompressible flow – the elements must be divergence-free. While the velocity is the variable of interest, the existence of the stream function or vector potential is necessary by the Helmholtz Theorem. Further, to determine fluid flow in the absence of a pressure gradient, one can specify the difference of stream function values across a 2D channel, or the line integral of the tangential component of the vector potential around the channel in 3D, the flow being given by [[Stokes' Theorem]]. Discussion will be restricted to 2D in the following.

We further restrict discussion to continuous Hermite finite elements which have at least first-derivative degrees-of-freedom. With this, one can draw a large number of candidate triangular and rectangular elements from the [[Bending of plates|plate-bending]] literature. These elements have derivatives as components of the gradient. In 2D, the gradient and curl of a scalar are clearly orthogonal, given by the expressions,
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\nabla\phi &amp;= \left(\frac{\partial \phi}{\partial x},\,\frac{\partial \phi}{\partial y}\right)^\mathrm{T}, \\
\nabla\times\phi &amp;= \left(\frac{\partial \phi}{\partial y},\,-\frac{\partial \phi}{\partial x}\right)^\mathrm{T}.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Adopting continuous plate-bending elements, interchanging the derivative degrees-of-freedom and changing the sign of the appropriate one gives many families of stream function elements.

Taking the curl of the scalar stream function elements gives divergence-free velocity elements.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The requirement that the stream function elements be continuous assures that the normal component of the velocity is continuous across element interfaces, all that is necessary for vanishing divergence on these interfaces.

Boundary conditions are simple to apply. The stream function is constant on no-flow surfaces, with no-slip velocity conditions on surfaces.
Stream function differences across open channels determine the flow. No boundary conditions are necessary on open boundaries, though consistent values may be used with some problems. These are all Dirichlet conditions.

The algebraic equations to be solved are simple to set up, but of course are [[#Nonlinearity|non-linear]], requiring iteration of the linearized equations.

Similar considerations apply to three-dimensions, but extension from 2D is not immediate because of the vector nature of the potential, and there exists no simple relation between the gradient and the curl as was the case in 2D.

===Pressure recovery===
Recovering pressure from the velocity field is easy. The discrete weak equation for the pressure gradient is,
:&lt;math&gt;(\mathbf{g}_i, \nabla p) = -\left(\mathbf{g}_i, \left(\mathbf{u}\cdot\nabla\right)\mathbf{u}_j\right) - \nu\left(\nabla\mathbf{g}_i: \nabla\mathbf{u}_j\right) + \left(\mathbf{g}_i, \mathbf{f}^I\right)&lt;/math&gt;

where the test/weight functions are irrotational. Any conforming scalar finite element may be used. However, the pressure gradient field may also be of interest. In this case one can use scalar Hermite elements for the pressure. For the test/weight functions {{math|'''g'''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}} one would choose the irrotational vector elements obtained from the gradient of the pressure element.

==Non-inertial frame of reference==

The rotating frame of reference introduces some interesting pseudo-forces into the equations through the [[material derivative]] term. Consider a stationary inertial frame of reference K, and a non-inertial frame of reference K', which is translating with velocity &lt;math&gt;\mathbf U(t)&lt;/math&gt; and rotating with angular velocity &lt;math&gt;\mathbf\Omega(t)&lt;/math&gt; with respect to the stationary frame. The Navier–Stokes equation observed from the non-inertial frame then becomes

{{Equation box 1
|indent=:
|title='''Navier–Stokes momentum equation in non-inertial frame''' 
|equation=&lt;math&gt; \rho \frac{D \mathbf{u}}{D t}  = - \nabla \bar{p} + \mu \, \nabla^2 \mathbf u + \tfrac13 \mu \, \nabla (\nabla\cdot\mathbf{u}) + \rho\mathbf{g}  - \rho \left(2\mathbf\Omega\times\mathbf u + \mathbf\Omega\times\mathbf\Omega\times\mathbf x+ \frac{d\mathbf U}{dt} + \frac{d\mathbf \Omega}{dt}\times\mathbf x\right).&lt;/math&gt;

}}

Here &lt;math&gt;\mathbf x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf u&lt;/math&gt; are measured in the non-inertial frame. The first term in the parenthesis represents [[Coriolis acceleration]], the second term is due to [[centripetal force|centripetal acceleration]], the third is due to the linear acceleration of K' with respect to K and the fourth term is due to the angular acceleration of K' with respect to K.

==Other equations==
The Navier–Stokes equations are strictly a statement of the balance of momentum. To fully describe fluid flow, more information is needed, how much depending on the assumptions made. This additional information may include boundary data ([[no-slip condition|no-slip]], [[capillary surface]], etc.), conservation of mass, balance of energy, and/or an [[equation of state]].

===Continuity equation for incompressible fluid===
{{main|Continuity equation}}

Regardless of the flow assumptions, a statement of the [[conservation of mass]] is generally necessary. This is achieved through the mass [[continuity equation]], given in its most general form as:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t} + \nabla \cdot (\rho \mathbf{u}) = 0&lt;/math&gt;

or, using the [[substantive derivative]]:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{D\rho}{Dt} + \rho (\nabla \cdot \mathbf{u}) = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

In the example below we can assume to have a [[Newtonian fluid]] as well as having {{mvar|ρ}} and {{mvar|μ}} both be constant.

Recall that mass continuity is simply the summation of the rate of mass in and the rate of mass out.
: rate of mass accumulated = rate of mass in − rate of mass out

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\Delta x \, \Delta \, y \Delta z \frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t} &amp;= \Delta y \, \Delta z \left (\rho U_x|_x - \rho U_x|_{x + \Delta x} \right) + \Delta x \Delta z \left(\rho U_y|_y - \rho U_y|_{y + \Delta y} \right) + \Delta \, x\Delta y \left (\rho U_z|_z - \rho U_z|_{z + \Delta z} \right ) \\[8pt]
\Rightarrow \frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t} &amp;= \frac{\rho U_x|_x - \rho U_x|_{x + \Delta x}}{\Delta x} + \frac{\rho U_y|_y- \rho U_y|_{y + \Delta y}}{\Delta y} + \frac{\rho U_z|_z - \rho U_z|_{z + \Delta z}}{\Delta z} \\[6pt]
&amp;= \rho \left (\frac{U_x|_x - U_x|_{x + \Delta x}}{\Delta x} + \frac{U_y|_y - U_y|_{y + \Delta y}}{\Delta y} + \frac{U_z|_z - U_z|_{z + \Delta z}}{\Delta z} \right ) \\[6pt]
&amp;= -\rho \left (\frac{\partial U_x}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial U_y}{\partial y} + \frac{\partial U_z}{\partial z} \right)
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Since there is no change in density {{mvar|ρ}} over time, {{math|{{sfrac|∂''ρ''|∂''t''}} {{=}} 0}}, we have:

:&lt;math&gt; 0 = -\rho \left (\frac{\partial U_x}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial U_y}{\partial y} + \frac{\partial U_z}{\partial z} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

Recall that {{mvar|ρ}} is a constant thus proving the divergence theorem above.

==Stream function for 2D equations==
Taking the [[Curl (mathematics)|curl]] of the Navier–Stokes equation results in the elimination of pressure. This is especially easy to see if 2D Cartesian flow is assumed (like in the degenerate 3D case with {{math|''u&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;'' {{=}} 0}} and no dependence of anything on {{mvar|z}}), where the equations reduce to:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
 \rho \left(\frac{\partial u_x}{\partial t} + u_x \frac{\partial u_x}{\partial x} + u_y \frac{\partial u_x}{\partial y}\right)
 &amp;= -\frac{\partial p}{\partial x} + \mu \left(\frac{\partial^2 u_x}{\partial x^2} + \frac{\partial^2 u_x}{\partial y^2}\right) + \rho g_x \\
 \rho \left(\frac{\partial u_y}{\partial t} + u_x \frac{\partial u_y}{\partial x} + u_y \frac{\partial u_y}{\partial y}\right)
 &amp;= -\frac{\partial p}{\partial y} + \mu \left(\frac{\partial^2 u_y}{\partial x^2} + \frac{\partial^2 u_y}{\partial y^2}\right) + \rho g_y.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Differentiating the first with respect to {{mvar|y}}, the second with respect to {{mvar|x}} and subtracting the resulting equations will eliminate pressure and any [[conservative force]]. Defining the [[stream function]] {{mvar|ψ}} through

:&lt;math&gt;u_x = \frac{\partial \psi}{\partial y}; \quad u_y = -\frac{\partial \psi}{\partial x}&lt;/math&gt;

results in mass continuity being unconditionally satisfied (given the stream function is continuous), and then incompressible Newtonian 2D momentum and mass conservation condense into one equation:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\left(\nabla^2 \psi\right) + \frac{\partial \psi}{\partial y} \frac{\partial}{\partial x}\left(\nabla^2 \psi\right) - \frac{\partial \psi}{\partial x} \frac{\partial}{\partial y}\left(\nabla^2 \psi\right) = \nu \nabla^4 \psi&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|∇&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;}} is the 2D [[biharmonic operator]] and {{mvar|ν}} is the [[kinematic viscosity]], {{math|''ν'' {{=}} {{sfrac|''μ''|''ρ''}}}}. We can also express this compactly using the [[Jacobian matrix and determinant|Jacobian determinant]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\left(\nabla^2 \psi\right) + \frac{\partial\left(\psi, \nabla^2\psi \right)}{\partial(y,x)} = \nu \nabla^4 \psi.&lt;/math&gt;

This single equation together with appropriate boundary conditions describes 2D fluid flow, taking only kinematic viscosity as a parameter. Note that the equation for [[creeping flow]] results when the left side is assumed zero.

In [[axisymmetric]] flow another stream function formulation, called the [[Stokes stream function]], can be used to describe the velocity components of an incompressible flow with one [[scalar (mathematics)|scalar]] function.

The incompressible Navier–Stokes equation is a [[differential algebraic equation]], having the inconvenient feature that there is no explicit mechanism for advancing the pressure in time. Consequently, much effort has been expended to eliminate the pressure from all or part of the computational process. The stream function formulation eliminates the pressure but only in two dimensions and at the expense of introducing higher derivatives and elimination of the velocity, which is the primary variable of interest.

==Properties==
===Nonlinearity===

The Navier–Stokes equations are [[nonlinear]] [[partial differential equations]] in the general case and so remain in almost every real situation.&lt;ref&gt;Fluid Mechanics (Schaum's Series), M. Potter, D.C. Wiggert, Schaum's Outlines, McGraw-Hill (USA), 2008, {{isbn|978-0-07-148781-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vectors, Tensors, and the basic Equations of Fluid Mechanics, R. Aris, Dover Publications, 1989, {{isbn|0-486-66110-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, such as one-dimensional flow and [[Stokes flow]] (or creeping flow), the equations can be simplified to linear equations. The nonlinearity makes most problems difficult or impossible to solve and is the main contributor to the [[turbulence]] that the equations model.

The nonlinearity is due to [[convective]] acceleration, which is an acceleration associated with the change in velocity over position. Hence, any convective flow, whether turbulent or not, will involve nonlinearity. An example of convective but [[laminar flow|laminar]] (nonturbulent) flow would be the passage of a viscous fluid (for example, oil) through a small converging [[nozzle]]. Such flows, whether exactly solvable or not, can often be thoroughly studied and understood.&lt;ref&gt;McGraw Hill Encyclopaedia of Physics (2nd Edition), C.B. Parker, 1994, {{isbn|0-07-051400-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Turbulence===

[[Turbulence]] is the time-dependent [[Chaos theory|chaotic]] behavior seen in many fluid flows. It is generally believed that it is due to the [[inertia]] of the fluid as a whole: the culmination of time-dependent and convective acceleration; hence flows where inertial effects are small tend to be laminar (the [[Reynolds number]] quantifies how much the flow is affected by inertia). It is believed, though not known with certainty, that the Navier–Stokes equations describe turbulence properly.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopaedia of Physics (2nd Edition), R.G. Lerner, G.L. Trigg, VHC publishers, 1991, ISBN (Verlagsgesellschaft) 3-527-26954-1, ISBN (VHC Inc.) 0-89573-752-3&lt;/ref&gt;

The numerical solution of the Navier–Stokes equations for turbulent flow is extremely difficult, and due to the significantly different mixing-length scales that are involved in turbulent flow, the stable solution of this requires such a fine mesh resolution that the computational time becomes significantly infeasible for calculation or [[direct numerical simulation]]. Attempts to solve turbulent flow using a laminar solver typically result in a time-unsteady solution, which fails to converge appropriately. To counter this, time-averaged equations such as the [[Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equations]] (RANS), supplemented with turbulence models, are used in practical [[computational fluid dynamics]] (CFD) applications when modeling turbulent flows. Some models include the [[Spalart–Allmaras turbulence model|Spalart–Allmaras]], [[k-omega turbulence model|{{mvar|k}}–{{mvar|ω}}]], [[turbulence kinetic energy|{{mvar|k}}–{{mvar|ε}}]], and SST models, which add a variety of additional equations to bring closure to the RANS equations. [[Large eddy simulation]] (LES) can also be used to solve these equations numerically. This approach is computationally more expensive—in time and in computer memory—than RANS, but produces better results because it explicitly resolves the larger turbulent scales.

===Applicability===
{{further|Discretization of Navier–Stokes equations}}
Together with supplemental equations (for example, conservation of mass) and well formulated boundary conditions, the Navier–Stokes equations seem to model fluid motion accurately; even turbulent flows seem (on average) to agree with real world observations.

The Navier–Stokes equations assume that the fluid being studied is a [[Continuum mechanics|continuum]] (it is infinitely divisible and not composed of particles such as atoms or molecules), and is not moving at [[Special relativity#Relativistic mechanics|relativistic velocities]]. At very small scales or under extreme conditions, real fluids made out of discrete molecules will produce results different from the continuous fluids modeled by the Navier–Stokes equations. For example, [[capillarity]] of internal layers in fluids appears for flow with high gradients.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

Another limitation is simply the complicated nature of the equations. Time-tested formulations exist for common fluid families, but the application of the Navier–Stokes equations to less common families tends to result in very complicated formulations and often to open research problems. For this reason, these equations are usually rewritten for [[Newtonian fluid]]s where the viscosity model is [[linear]]; truly general models for the flow of other kinds of fluids (such as blood) do not exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

==Application to specific problems==
The Navier–Stokes equations, even when written explicitly for specific fluids, are rather generic in nature and their proper application to specific problems can be very diverse. This is partly because there is an enormous variety of problems that may be modeled, ranging from as simple as the distribution of static pressure to as complicated as [[multiphase flow]] driven by [[surface tension]].

Generally, application to specific problems begins with some flow assumptions and initial/boundary condition formulation, this may be followed by [[Scale analysis (mathematics)|scale analysis]] to further simplify the problem.

[[Image:NSConvection vectorial.svg|thumb|400px|Visualization of '''(a)''' parallel flow and '''(b)''' radial flow.]]

===Parallel flow===
Assume steady, parallel, one dimensional, non-convective pressure-driven flow between parallel plates, the resulting scaled (dimensionless) [[boundary value problem]] is:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d^2 u}{d y^2} = -1; \quad u(0) = u(1) = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

The boundary condition is the [[no slip condition]]. This problem is easily solved for the flow field:
:&lt;math&gt;u(y) = \frac{y - y^2}{2}.&lt;/math&gt;

From this point onward more quantities of interest can be easily obtained, such as viscous drag force or net flow rate.

===Radial flow===
Difficulties may arise when the problem becomes slightly more complicated. A seemingly modest twist on the parallel flow above would be the ''radial'' flow between parallel plates; this involves convection and thus non-linearity. The velocity field may be represented by a function {{math|''f''(''z'')}} that must satisfy:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d^2 f}{d z^2} + R f^2 = -1; \quad f(-1) = f(1) = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

This [[ordinary differential equation]] is what is obtained when the Navier–Stokes equations are written and the flow assumptions applied (additionally, the pressure gradient is solved for). The [[nonlinear]] term makes this a very difficult problem to solve analytically (a lengthy [[Implicit function|implicit]] solution may be found which involves [[elliptic integrals]] and [[Cubic formula|roots of cubic polynomials]]). Issues with the actual existence of solutions arise for {{math|''R'' &gt; 1.41}} (approximately; this is not [[square root of 2|{{sqrt|2}}]]), the parameter R being the Reynolds number with appropriately chosen scales.&lt;ref name="TM Shah"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shah |first=Tasneem Mohammad|title=Analysis of the multigrid method|journal=Nasa Sti/recon Technical Report N|volume=91|pages=23418|bibcode=1989STIN...9123418S|year=1972}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is an example of flow assumptions losing their applicability, and an example of the difficulty in "high" Reynolds number flows.&lt;ref name="TM Shah"/&gt;

===Convection===
A type of natural convection which can be described by the Navier–Stokes equation is the [[Rayleigh–Bénard convection]]. It is one of the most commonly studied convection phenomena because of its analytical and experimental accessibility.

==Exact solutions of the Navier–Stokes equations==
Some exact solutions to the Navier–Stokes equations exist. Examples of degenerate cases — with the non-linear terms in the Navier–Stokes equations equal to zero — are [[Hagen-Poiseuille equation|Poiseuille flow]], [[Couette flow]] and the oscillatory [[Stokes boundary layer]]. But also more interesting examples, solutions to the full non-linear equations, exist such as [[Jeffery–Hamel flow]], [[Von Kármán swirling flow]], [[Stagnation point flow]], [[Landau–Squire jet]], [[Taylor–Green vortex]].&lt;ref&gt;

Note that the existence of these exact solutions does not imply they are stable: turbulence may develop at higher Reynolds numbers.

Under additional assumptions, the component parts can be separated.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.claudino.webs.com/Navier%20Stokes%20Equations.pps]&lt;/ref&gt;

for arbitrary constants {{mvar|A}} and {{mvar|B}}. This is a solution in a non-viscous gas (compressible fluid) whose density, velocities and pressure goes to zero far from the origin. (Note this is not a solution to the Clay Millennium problem because that refers to incompressible fluids where {{mvar|ρ}} is a constant, neither does it deal with the uniqueness of the Navier–Stokes equations with respect to any [[turbulence]] properties.) It is also worth pointing out that the components of the velocity vector are exactly those from the [[Pythagorean quadruple]] parametrization. Other choices of density and pressure are possible with the same velocity field:

{{hidden
|Other choices of density and pressure
|Another choice of pressure and density with the same velocity vector above is one where the pressure and density fall to zero at the origin and are highest in the central loop at {{math|''z'' {{=}} 0}}, {{math|''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ''y''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; {{=}} ''r''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
 x&amp;:\ &amp;\rho \left(\frac{\partial u_x}{\partial t} + u_x \frac{\partial u_x}{\partial x} + u_y \frac{\partial u_x}{\partial y} + u_z \frac{\partial u_x}{\partial z}\right) &amp;= -\frac{\partial p}{\partial x} + \mu \left(\frac{\partial^2 u_x}{\partial x^2} + \frac{\partial^2 u_x}{\partial y^2} + \frac{\partial^2 u_x}{\partial z^2}\right) + \frac{1}{3} \mu \frac{\partial}{\partial x} \left( \frac{\partial u_x}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial u_y}{\partial y} + \frac{\partial u_z}{\partial z} \right) + \rho g_x \\

Note that gravity has been accounted for as a body force, and the values of {{mvar|g&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;}}, {{mvar|g&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;}}, {{mvar|g&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;}} will depend on the orientation of gravity with respect to the chosen set of coordinates.

The continuity equation reads:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t} + \frac{\partial \left(\rho u_x \right) }{ \partial x} + \frac{\partial \left(\rho u_y\right) }{ \partial y} + \frac{\partial \left(\rho u_z\right) }{ \partial z} = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

When the flow is incompressible, {{mvar|ρ}} does not change for any fluid particle, and its [[material derivative]] vanishes: {{math|{{sfrac|''Dρ''|''Dt''}} {{=}} 0}}. The continuity equation is reduced to:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial u_x }{ \partial x} + \frac{\partial u_y }{ \partial y} + \frac{\partial u_z }{ \partial z} = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

Thus, for the incompressible version of the Navier–Stokes equation the second part of the viscous terms fall away (see [[Incompressible flow]]).

This system of four equations comprises the most commonly used and studied form. Though comparatively more compact than other representations, this is still a [[nonlinear]] system of [[partial differential equations]] for which solutions are difficult to obtain.

\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The gravity components will generally not be constants, however for most applications either the coordinates are chosen so that the gravity components are constant or else it is assumed that gravity is counteracted by a pressure field (for example, flow in horizontal pipe is treated normally without gravity and without a vertical pressure gradient). The continuity equation is:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial\rho}{\partial t} + \frac{1}{r}\frac{\partial}{\partial r}\left(\rho r u_r\right) + \frac{1}{r}\frac{\partial \left(\rho u_\phi\right)}{\partial \phi} + \frac{\partial \left(\rho u_z\right)}{\partial z} = 0.
&lt;/math&gt;

This cylindrical representation of the incompressible Navier–Stokes equations is the second most commonly seen (the first being Cartesian above). Cylindrical coordinates are chosen to take advantage of symmetry, so that a velocity component can disappear. A very common case is axisymmetric flow with the assumption of no tangential velocity ({{math|''u&lt;sub&gt;φ&lt;/sub&gt;'' {{=}} 0}}), and the remaining quantities are independent of {{mvar|φ}}:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
 \rho \left(\frac{\partial u_r}{\partial t} + u_r \frac{\partial u_r}{\partial r} + u_z \frac{\partial u_r}{\partial z}\right)

Mass continuity will read:

These equations could be (slightly) compacted by, for example, factoring {{math|{{sfrac|1|''r''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}}} from the viscous terms. However, doing so would undesirably alter the structure of the Laplacian and other quantities.

==Navier–Stokes equations use in games==
The Navier–Stokes equations are used extensively in [[video games]] in order to model a wide variety of natural phenomena. Simulations of small-scale gaseous fluids, such as fire and smoke, are often based on the seminal paper "Real-Time Fluid Dynamics for Games"&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Jos Stam]], which elaborates one of the methods proposed in Stam's earlier, more famous paper "Stable Fluids"&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt; from 1999. Stam proposes stable fluid simulation using a Navier–Stokes solution method from 1968, coupled with an unconditionally stable semi-Lagrangian [[advection]] scheme, as first proposed in 1992.

More recent implementations based upon this work run on the game systems [[graphics processing unit]] (GPU) as opposed to the [[central processing unit]] (CPU) and achieve a much higher degree of performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

Many improvements have been proposed to Stam's original work, which suffers inherently from high numerical dissipation in both velocity and mass.

{{Unreferenced|date=December 2006}}
'''Nominal power''' is a measurement of a [[mediumwave]] [[radio station]]'s output used in the [[United States]].  AM broadcasters are licensed by the [[Federal Communications Commission]] to operate at a specific [[Real versus nominal value|nominal]] [[power (physics)|power]], which may be (and usually is) different from the [[transmitter power output]].

* For [[omnidirectional antenna|non-directional]] stations, nominal power is normally equal to the [[Radio frequency|RF]] power presented to the antenna, as determined from the base [[electrical current|current]] and the antenna's nominal [[Electrical impedance|impedance]] at the [[carrier wave|carrier]] frequency.
* For [[directional antenna|directional]] stations, nominal power is normally equal to the RF power at the [[common point]] (the point at which the transmitter output branches off into separate [[phasing network]]s for each tower).

In both cases, nominal power excludes losses in transmission lines between the tower or [[phasor]] and the transmitter; however, it ''includes'' losses in a [[resistor network]] used to decrease the efficiency of the antenna system.

Nominal power is ultimately a historical artifact of the regulatory regime employed by the FCC prior to the 1980s.  In the old system, rather than allowing licensees to choose any power level which would meet the efficiency and [[Interference (communication)|interference]] standards for their class, stations were restricted to a small set of power levels: 50, 100, 250, 500, 1000, 2500, 5000, 10000, 25000, and 50000 [[watt]]s.  A station whose maximum coverage would otherwise be available at 4500 watts (given a specific directional pattern and antenna system efficiency) had a choice of either living with 2500 watts, or reducing the antenna efficiency to a level which would allow for 5 kW.  Newly-constructed stations could fairly easily design an antenna system to meet the requirements, but stations on or moving to a shared tower with higher efficiency had a problem.  The resistor network exception was created to allow stations to reduce their antenna efficiency without having to modify the existing tower.

Rule changes in the 1980s did away with the fixed set of power choices, allowing stations to choose an appropriate power level for their antenna system ("dial-a-power"), so there should no longer be any need for the concept of nominal power.  However, stations still take advantage of the resistor exception in some cases, simply because they perceive the marketing advantage of higher power (or at least "round" power) to be worth the cost of the wasted energy.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6974">'''Optical brighteners''', '''optical brightening agents''' ('''OBAs'''), '''fluorescent brightening agents''' ('''FBAs'''), or '''fluorescent whitening agents''' ('''FWAs'''),  are chemical compounds that absorb light in the [[ultraviolet]] and violet region (usually 340-370&amp;nbsp;nm) of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]], and re-emit light in the blue region (typically 420-470&amp;nbsp;nm) by [[fluorescence]]. Fluorescent emission is a short-lived period of light emission by a fluorophore, unlike [[phosphorescence]], which is long-lived. These additives are often used to enhance the appearance of color of [[textile|fabric]] and [[paper]], causing a "whitening" effect; they make intrinsically yellow/orange materials look less so, by compensating the deficit in blue and purple light reflected by the material, with the blue and purple optical emission of the fluorophore.&lt;ref name=Ullmann&gt;Eduard Smulders, Wolfgang Rybinski, Eric Sung, Wilfried Rähse, Josef Steber, Frederike Wiebel, Anette Nordskog, "Laundry Detergents" in Ullmann’s Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry 2002, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. {{DOI|10.1002/14356007.a08_315.pub2}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Image:LaundrydetergentGlow.jpg|thumb|right|Laundry detergent fluorescing under ultraviolet light]]

==Properties==
The most common classes of compounds with this property are the [[(Z)-Stilbene|stilbenes]], e.g., [[4,4′-Diamino-2,2′-stilbenedisulfonic acid|4,4′-diamino-2,2′-stilbenedisulfonic acid]]. Older, non-commercial [[fluorescence|fluorescent]] chemicals include as [[umbelliferone]], which absorbs in the [[Ultraviolet|UV]] portion of the spectrum and re-emit it in the blue portion of the visible spectrum.  A white surface treated with an optical brightener can emit more visible light than that which shines on it, making it appear brighter. The blue light emitted by the brightener compensates for the diminishing blue of the treated material and changes the hue away from yellow or brown and toward white.&lt;ref name=U2&gt;E. Smulders, E. Sung "Laundry Detergents, 2. Ingredients and Products" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim, 2012.  {{DOI|10.1002/14356007.o15_013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:DAMBDSacid.png|thumb|right|[[4,4′-Diamino-2,2′-stilbenedisulfonic acid|4,4′-diamino-2,2′-stilbenedisulfonic acid]] is a popular optical brightener.]]
[[File:2 5-bis(benzoxazol-2-yl)thiophene.svg|thumb|right|4 4'-bis(benzoxazolyl)-cis-stilbene and 2 5-bis(benzoxazol-2-yl)thiophene (shown here) are also intensely fluorescent and used as optical brighteners, e.g., in laundry detergents.&lt;ref&gt;M. Amine Fourati, Thierry Maris, W. G. Skene, C. Géraldine Bazuin, and Robert E. Prud’homme "Photophysical, Electrochemical and Crystallographic Investigations of the Fluorophore 2,5-Bis(5-tert-butyl-benzoxazol-2-yl)thiophene" J. Phys. Chem. B, 2011, volume 115, 12362–12369.{{DOI|10.1021/jp207136k}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Approximately 400 brightener types are listed in the Colour Index, but fewer than 90 are produced commercially, and only a handful are commercially important. Generically, the C.I. FBA number can be assigned to a specific substance, however, some are duplicated, since manufacturers apply for the index number when they produce it. The global OBA production for paper, textiles, and detergents is dominated by just a few di- and tetra-sulfonated triazole-stilbenes and a di-sulfonated stilbene-biphenyl derivatives. The stilbene derivatives are subject to fading upon prolonged exposure to UV, due to the formation of optically inactive cis-stilbenes. They are also degraded by oxygen in air, like most dye colorants. All brighteners have extended conjugation and/or aromaticity, allowing for electron movement. Some non-stilbene brighteners are used in more permanent applications such as whitening synthetic fiber.

Brighteners can be "boosted" by the addition of certain [[polyols]], such as high molecular weight [[polyethylene glycol]] or [[polyvinyl alcohol]]. These additives increase the visible blue light emissions significantly. Brighteners can also be "quenched". Excess brightener will often cause a greening effect as emissions start to show above the blue region in the visible spectrum.

==Common uses==
Brighteners are commonly added to [[laundry detergent]]s to make the clothes appear cleaner.  Normally cleaned laundry appears yellowish, which consumers do not like.&lt;ref name=U2/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tide.com/media/pdf/products/ingredients/en-CA/tide-he.pdf|website=Tide: Ingredients by function|accessdate=30 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Optical brighteners have replaced [[Bluing (fabric)|bluing]] which was formerly used to produce the same effect.

Brighteners are used in many papers, especially high brightness papers, resulting in their strongly fluorescent appearance under UV illumination.  Paper brightness is typically measured at 457&amp;nbsp;nm, well within the fluorescent activity range of brighteners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=Printer Technical Service |title=Understanding Paper Brightness |url=https://cdn-s3.sappi.com/s3fs-public/sappietc/Understanding%20Paper%20Brightness.pdf |website=sappi/etc |accessdate=5 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paper used for banknotes does not contain optical brighteners, so a common method for detecting [[counterfeit]] notes is to check for fluorescence.

Optical brighteners have also found use in [[cosmetics]].  One application is to formulas for washing and conditioning grey or blonde hair, where the brightener can not only increase the luminance and sparkle of the hair, but can also correct dull, yellowish discoloration without darkening the hair.  Some advanced face and eye powders contain optical brightener [[microsphere]]s that brighten shadowed or dark areas of the skin, such as "tired eyes".{{cn|date=April 2017}}

A side effect of textile optical whitening is to make the treated fabrics more visible with [[Night Vision Device]]s than non-treated ones. This may or may not be desirable for military or other applications.{{cn|date=April 2017}} Optically brightened paper is often not useful in exacting photographic or art applications, since the whiteness decreases with time.{{cn|date=April 2017}}

End uses of optical brighteners include:
# Detergent whitener (instead of bluing agents)
# [[paper chemicals|Paper brightening]] ([[sizing|internal]] or in a [[coated paper|coating]])
# Fiber whitening (internal, added to polymer melts)
# Textile whitening (external, added to [[textile finishing|fabric finishes]])
# Color-correcting or brightening additive in advanced [[Cosmetics|cosmetic]] formulas ([[shampoo]]s, conditioners, eye makeup)

==Safety==
Some brighteners can cause allergic reactions when in contact with skin, depending on the individual.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17227">{{for|circuits using earth as a second conductor|Single-wire earth return}}
A '''single-wire transmission line''' (or '''single wire method''') is a method of transmitting electrical power or signals using only a ''single'' electrical conductor. This is in contrast to the usual use of a pair of wires providing a complete circuit, or an [[electrical cable]] likewise containing (at least) two conductors for that purpose.

The single-wire transmission line is not the same as the [[single-wire earth return]] system, which is not covered in this article.  The latter system relies on a return current through the [[Ground (electricity)|ground]], using the earth as a second conductor between ground terminal electrodes.  Thus, the earth effectively forms a second conductor.  In a single-wire transmission line there is no second conductor of any form.

==History==
As early as the 1780s [[Luigi Galvani]] first observed the effect of [[static electricity]] in causing the legs of a frog to twitch, and observed the same effect produced just due to certain metallic contacts with the frog involving a complete circuit. The latter effect was correctly understood by [[Alessandro Volta]] as an electric current inadvertently produced by what would become known as a [[voltaic cell]] (battery). He understood that such a current required a complete circuit to conduct the electricity, even though the actual nature of electric currents was not at all understood (only a century later would the [[electron]] be discovered). All subsequent development of electrical motors, lights, etc. relied on the principle of a complete circuit, generally involving a pair of wires, but sometimes using the ground as the second conductor (as with commercial [[telegraphy]]).

At the end of the 19th century, [[Nikola Tesla]] demonstrated that by using an [[electrical network]] tuned to [[resonance]] it was possible to transmit electric power using only a single conductor, with no need for a return wire. This was spoken of as the "transmission of electrical energy through one wire without return".&lt;ref&gt;"''[http://www.tfcbooks.com/teslafaq/q&amp;a_045.htm Why did Tesla make his coil in the first place? . . . do they have any practical purposes?]''," 21st Century Books.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nikola Tesla, "''[https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uiug.30112109670726;view=1up;seq=157 Talking with the Planets (1901)]". Collier's Weekly, February 19, 1901, pp.&amp;nbsp;4–5.

&lt;blockquote&gt; "Some ten years ago, I recognized the fact that to convey electric currents to a distance it was not at all necessary to employ a return wire, but that any amount of energy might be transmitted by using a single wire. I illustrated this principle by numerous experiments, which, at that time, excited considerable attention among scientific men."&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1891, 1892, and 1893 demonstration lectures with electrical oscillators before the AIEE at Columbia College, N.Y.C., the IEE, London, the Franklin Institute, Philadelphia, and National Electric Light Association, St. Louis, it was shown that electric motors and single-terminal incandescent lamps can be operated through a single conductor without a return wire. Although apparently lacking a complete circuit, such a topology effectively obtains a return circuit by virtue of the load's [[self-capacitance]] and [[parasitic capacitance]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tfcbooks.com/tesla/1891-05-20.htm Experiments with Alternate Currents of Very High Frequency and Their Application to Methods of Artificial Illumination], American Institute of Electrical Engineers, Columbia College, N.Y., May 20, 1891.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tfcbooks.com/tesla/1892-02-03.htm Experiments with Alternate Currents of High Potential and High Frequency], Institution of Electrical Engineers Address, London, February 1892.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Thus coils of the proper dimensions might be connected each with only one of its ends to the mains from a machine of low E. M. F., and though the circuit of the machine ''would not be closed in the ordinary acceptance of the term'', yet the machine might be burned out if a proper resonance effect would be obtained.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tfcbooks.com/tesla/1893-02-24.htm On Light and Other High Frequency Phenomena], Franklin Institute, Philadelphia, February 1893, and National Electric Light Association, St. Louis, March 1893.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The final reference to "burning out" a machine was to emphasize the ability of such a system to transmit a large power given a proper [[impedance match]], as can be obtained through electrical [[Resonant circuit#Resonance effect|resonance]].

==Theory==
This observation has been rediscovered several times, and described, for instance, in a 1993 patent.&lt;ref&gt;{{US patent|6104107}}, "''Method and apparatus for single line electrical transmission''".&amp;nbsp; Avramenko, et al.&lt;/ref&gt; Single-wire transmission in this sense is not possible using [[direct current]] and totally impractical for low frequency [[alternating current]]s such as the standard 50–60&amp;nbsp;Hz power line frequencies. At much higher frequencies, however, it is possible for the return circuit (which would normally be connected through a second wire) to utilize the self- and parasitic capacitance of a large conductive object, perhaps the housing of the [[Electrical load|load]] itself. Although the self-capacitance of even large objects is rather small in ordinary terms, as Tesla himself appreciated it is possible to [[Resonant circuit#Resonance effect|resonate]] that capacitance using a sufficiently large [[inductor]] (depending on the frequency used), in which case the large [[Electrical reactance|reactance]] of that capacitance is cancelled out. This allows a large current to flow (and a large power to be supplied to the load) without requiring an extremely high voltage source. Although this method of power transmission has long been understood, it is not clear whether there has been any commercial application of this principle for [[Electric power transmission|power transmission]].

==Single conductor waveguides==
As early as 1899, [[Arnold Sommerfeld]] published a paper&lt;ref&gt;A. Sommerfeld, Ann. Phys. u. Chemie (Neue Folge) 67-1, 233
(1899)&lt;/ref&gt; predicting the use of a single cylindrical conductor (wire) to propagate [[radio frequency]] energy as a [[surface wave]]. Sommerfeld's "wire wave" was of theoretical interest as a propagating mode, but this was decades before technology existed for the generation of sufficiently high radio frequencies for any such experimentation, let alone practical applications. What's more, the solution described an infinite transmission line without consideration of coupling energy into (or out of) it.

Of particular practical interest, though, was the prediction of a substantially lower signal [[attenuation]] compared to using the same wire as the center conductor of a [[coaxial cable]]. Contrary to the previous explanation of the ''full'' transmitted power being due to a classical current through a wire, in this case the currents in the conductor itself are much smaller, with the energy transmitted in the form of an [[electromagnetic wave]] ([[radio wave]]). But in this case, the presence of the wire acts to guide that wave toward the load, rather than radiating away.

The reduction of [[Copper loss|ohmic losses]] compared to using coax (or other two-wire transmission lines) is especially an advantage at higher frequencies where these losses become very large. Practically speaking, use of this transmission mode below microwave frequencies is very problematic due to the very extended field patterns around the wire. The fields associated with the surface wave along the conductor are significant out to many conductor diameters, therefore metallic or even dielectric materials inadvertently present in these regions will distort the propagation of the mode and typically will increase propagation loss. Although there is no wavelength dependence to this dimension in the transverse direction, in the direction of propagation it is necessary to have a minimum of one half wave of conductor length to full support the propagating mode. For these reasons, and at frequencies available prior to about 1950, the practical disadvantages of such transmission completely outweighed the reduced loss due to the wire's finite conductivity.

===Goubau line===
{{main|Goubau line}}
In 1950 Georg Goubau revisited Sommerfeld's discovery of a surface wave mode along a wire, but with the intent of increasing its practicality.&lt;ref&gt;''Georg Goubau, "Surface waves and their Application to Transmission Lines," Journal of Applied Physics, Volume 21, Nov. (1950)''&lt;/ref&gt; One major goal was to reduce the extent of the fields surrounding the conductor so that such a wire would not require an unreasonably large clearance. Another problem was that Sommerfeld's wave propagated exactly at the speed of light (or the slightly lower speed of light in air, for a wire surrounded by air). That meant that there would be [[Alternating current#Techniques for reducing radiation loss|radiation losses]]. The straight wire acts as a [[Random wire antenna#Random Wire and Long Wire|long wire antenna]], robbing the radiated power from the guided mode. If the propagation velocity can be reduced below the speed of light then the surrounding fields become [[evanescent field|evanescent]], and are thus unable to propagate energy away from the area surrounding the wire.

Goubau investigated the beneficial effect of a wire whose surface is structured (rather than an exact cylinder) such as would be obtained using a threaded wire. More significantly, Goubau proposed the application of a dielectric layer surrounding the wire. Even a rather thin layer (relative to the wavelength) of a dielectric will reduce the propagation velocity sufficiently below the speed of light, eliminating radiation loss from a surface wave along the surface of a long straight wire. This modification also had the effect of greatly reducing the footprint of the electromagnetic fields surrounding the wire, addressing the other practical concern.&lt;ref&gt;{{US patent|2685068}}, "''Surface wave transmission line''". George J. E. Goubau&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, Goubau invented a method for launching (and receiving) electrical energy from such a transmission line. The patented&lt;ref&gt;{{US patent|2921277}}, "''Launching and receiving of surface waves''". George J. E. Goubau&lt;/ref&gt; Goubau line (or "G-line") consists of a single conductor coated with dielectric material. At each end is a wide disk with a hole in the center through which the transmission line passes. The disk may be the base of a cone, with its narrow end connected typically to the shield of [[coax|coaxial feed line]], and the transmission line itself connecting to the center conductor of the coax.

Even with the reduced extent of the surrounding fields in Goubau's design, such a device only becomes practical at [[Ultra high frequency|UHF]] frequencies and above. With technological development at [[Terahertz radiation|terahertz]] frequencies, where metallic losses are yet greater, the use of transmission using surface waves and Goubau lines appears promising.&lt;ref&gt;''Tahsin Akalin, "Single-wire transmission lines at terahertz frequencies", IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques (IEEE-MTT),  Volume 54, Issue 6, June 2006 Page(s): 2762 - 2767''&lt;/ref&gt;

===E-Line===
From 2003 through 2008 patents were filed for a system using Sommerfeld's original bare (uncoated) wire, but employing a launcher similar to that developed by Goubau.&lt;ref&gt;{{US patent|7009471}}, "''Method and apparatus for launching a surfacewave onto a single conductor transmission line using a slotted flared cone''". Glenn E. Elmore&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{US patent|7567154}}, "'' Surface wave transmission system over a single conductor having E-fields terminating along the conductor  ''" Glenn E. Elmore&lt;/ref&gt; It was promoted under the name "E-Line" through 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title= E-Line |publisher= Corridor Systems Inc. |year= 2010 |url= http://www.corridor.biz/News.html |accessdate= November 6, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus the resulting wave velocity is not reduced by a dielectric coating or special conditioning of the conductor as prescribed as necessary for non-radiation by Goubau for G-Line. This line is claimed to be completely non-radiating, propagating energy by way of a previously unrecognized transverse-magnetic (TM) wave. The intended application in this case is particularly for creating high information rate channels using existing power lines for communications purposes. This has been proposed for transmission of frequencies from below 50&amp;nbsp;MHz to above 20&amp;nbsp;GHz using pre-existing single or multistrand overhead power conductors.{{Citation needed |date= November 2013}}

While Goubau-Line, which requires a conductor having an outer dielectric or special surface conditioning provided to reduce the velocity of the wave on the conductor, has long been known, this more general transverse-magnetic (TM) mode does not have this limitation. E-Line is similar to the Goubau-Line in its use of launchers to couple to and from a radially symmetric wave propagating in the space around a single conductor but different in that it can operate on insulation-free conductors, including those that are polished and completely unfeatured. The propagation velocity of the wave is not reduced and is essentially that of a wave traveling in the same medium in the absence of any conductor at all. Furthermore, practical launchers need not have a cross-section that is a large portion of a wavelength. Energy associated with the wave is confined to a region determined by the diameter and geometry of the conductor rather than the wavelength of the propagating signal. The Launcher has a low frequency cutoff limited  by launcher length along the conductor.

The behavior of such a system is independent of the operating frequency,  but is dependent upon details of the power conductor and its environment. "A nearby conductor other than the line itself may provide a termination point and thereby reduce energy coupled into the TM wave".&lt;ref name="elmore"&gt;{{cite web |title= Introduction to the Propagating TM Wave on a Single Conductor |author= Glenn Elmore |date= July 27, 2009 |url= http://www.corridor.biz/FullArticle.pdf |publisher= Corridor Systems |accessdate= November 6, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (This has relevance to Tesla's 1891-1893 table-top demonstrations.&lt;!-- how? --&gt;) As for any transmission line, at very high frequencies, the increased losses of the metal conductor, despite the advantage obtained using the surface wave mode, are increased, however because conductor losses are inversely proportional to the square of line impedance, this mode can achieve much lower losses, no more than a few percent of a 50 ohm coaxial line having the same center conductor. The effects of line taps, bends, insulators and other impairments normally found on power distribution systems have been described as "predictable and manageable".&lt;ref name="elmore"&gt;{{cite web |title= Introduction to the Propagating TM Wave on a Single Conductor |author= Glenn Elmore |date= July 27, 2009 |url= http://www.corridor.biz/FullArticle.pdf |publisher= Corridor Systems |accessdate= November 6, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Depending on these factors, the resulting [[insertion loss]], along with the transmitted power and receiver sensitivity, will determine the maximum distance attained by such a system. Like CATV systems, an increased end-to-end communications path can be obtained through the use of [[repeater]]s.{{Citation needed |date= November 2013}}

To take advantage of existing lines, the conical launcher elements are built with a slot through the cone, so that they can be easily fitted over an existing power line (rather than having to be threaded through the cone). Systems  can employ a launch device of only 15–20&amp;nbsp;cm in diameter from upper HF through millimeter wavelengths as long as the launch has sufficient length along the conductor. Generally structures at least one quarter wavelength long are required. A one meter long launcher with a 10 cm opening can provide under 2 dB of insertion loss from 130 MHz through many GHz.&lt;ref name="N6GNswtl"&gt;{{cite web |title= Real Power Transmitted over a 0.32mm Wire |author= Glenn Elmore |date= February 6, 2016 | url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2irtYGsb5kg |publisher= Glenn Elmore |accessdate= September 1, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Systems built in this manner can provide both significant energy transfer e. g. providing motive power for electric helicopters acting as aerostats, at the same time they provide low loss transmission line connection to light weight, high altitude antennas.&lt;ref name="N6GN"&gt;{{cite web |title= SWTL Powered Drone/Antenna |author= Glenn Elmore |date= February 6, 2016 | url= http://www.sonic.net/~n6gn/SWTL_Powered_Drone_Antennas.html |publisher= Glenn Elmore |accessdate= September 1, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sivens Dam''' ('''''Barrage de Sivens''''') is a [[dam]] which in 2014 was planned for construction across the [[Tescou]], a tributary of the [[Tarn (river)|Tarn]] in the basin of the [[Garonne]] in Southern [[France]]. The construction site is 10&amp;nbsp;km north of [[Lisle-sur-Tarn]], in the [[Department of Tarn]] ([[Midi-Pyrénées]]). The dam is named after the nearby ''Forest of Sivens''. Construction work began in 2014. The project has since been closed.&lt;ref name=a1&gt;http://www.ladepeche.fr/article/2016/07/02/2377539-sivens-la-deliberation-d-utilite-publique-annulee.html&lt;/ref&gt;

On 26 October 2014, [[Rémi Fraisse]], a 21-year-old student protesting against the construction project, was killed after being hit in the back by a [[stun grenade]], sparking further protests, some of which were violent.&lt;ref name="Guardian 28 October 2014"&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/28/french-socialists-greens-sivens-dam-protestor-remi-fraisse-grenade-autopsy The Guardian, 28 October 2014, French Socialists and Greens at odds following death of Sivens dam protester, by Anne Penketh in Paris]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
Sivens is in the Tescou, a tributary of the Tarn in the basin of the Garonne. A barrage project was initiated for the formation of a water reservoir with a volume of 1.5 million cubic metres used especially for irrigation of agricultural land and the control of the low water Tescou. The impact of the project lies in retaining the flooding of 12 hectares of [[wetland]]. Countervailing measures were planned to restore a total area of 19.5 hectares of wetlands. This project was to have benefited from 30%  European funds (Fedear). The main actors of the project were the general council of Tarn region, Water Agency Adour Garonne and the development company "Slopes of Gascony".
In 2011, a collective was created against this project : "Tant qu’il y aura des bouilles". Hundreds of people came to the zone planned for flooding to live there and to prevent the construction of the dam.&lt;ref name="Figaro 27 Feb 2014"&gt;[http://www.lefigaro.fr/flash-actu/2014/02/27/97001-20140227FILWWW00154-barragetarn-expulsion-des-opposants.php ''Le Figaro'', 27 Feb 2014, Barrage/Tarn : expulsion des opposants]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Libération 2 May 2014"&gt;[http://www.liberation.fr/economie/2014/05/02/a-sivens-un-autre-dame-des-landes_1009442 ''Libération'', 2 May 2014, À Sivens, un autre Dame-des-Landes]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="La Dépêche du Midi 31 Aug 14"&gt;[http://www.ladepeche.fr/article/2014/08/31/1942603-semaine-cruciale-a-sivens-pour-le-projet-de-barrage.html ''La Dépêche du Midi'' 31 August 2014, Semaine cruciale à Sivens pour le projet de barrage]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Solar street lights''' are raised light sources which are powered by [[solar panel]]s generally mounted on the lighting structure or integrated in the pole itself. The solar panels charge a rechargeable battery, which powers a [[fluorescent lamp|fluorescent]] or [[LED lamp]] during the night.

== Features ==

Most solar lights turn on and turn off automatically by sensing outdoor light using solar panel voltage. Solar streetlights are designed to work throughout the night. Many can stay lit for more than one night if the sun is not available for a couple of days. Older models included lamps that were not fluorescent or LED. Solar lights installed in windy regions are generally equipped with flat panels to better cope with the winds.

Latest designs use wireless technology and [[fuzzy control]] theory for battery management. The street lights using this technology can operate as a network with each light having the capability of performing on or off the network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/freeabs_all.jsp?arnumber=5750620|title=A New Intelligent Control Terminal of Solar Street Light|publisher=ieeexplore.ieee.org|accessdate=2011-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Components ==

Solar street lights consist of 4 main parts:

=== Solar Panel ===
The solar panel is one of the most important parts of solar street lights, as the solar panel will convert solar energy into electricity. There are 2 types of solar panel: mono-crystalline and poly-crystalline. Conversion rate of mono-crystalline solar panel is much higher than poly-crystalline.Solar panel are varies from wattage systems.

=== Lighting Fixture ===
LED is usually used as lighting source of modern solar street light, as the LED will provide much higher Lumens with lower energy consumption. The energy consumption of LED fixture is at least 50% lower than HPS fixture which is widely used as lighting source in Traditional street lights. LEDs lack of warm up time also allows for use of motion detectors for additional efficiency gains.

=== Rechargeable Battery  ===
Battery will store the electricity from solar panel during the day and provide energy to the fixture during night. The life cycle of the battery is very important to the lifetime of the light and the capacity of the battery will affect the backup days of the lights. There are usually 2 types of batteries: Gel Cell Deep Cycle Battery and Lead Acid Battery and many more. Lithium-ion batteries are also popular these days as they are compact in size and not prone to theft (cannot be used in other applications like lead acid batteries).

=== Pole ===
Strong Poles are necessary to all street lights, especially to solar street lights as there are often components mounted on the top of the pole: fixtures, panels and sometimes batteries. However, in some newer designs, the PV panels and all electronics are integrated in the pole itself. Wind resistance is also a factor.

Also there are some accessories, like foudation cage and battery box.

== Types ==
[[File:Church and bus stop, Llandissiliogogo - geograph.org.uk - 581087.jpg|thumbnail|Solar street light at the bus stop]]
Each street light can have its own photo voltaic panel, independent of other street lights. Alternately, a number of panels can be installed as a central power source on a separate location and supply power to a number of street lights. &lt;ref name=foset&gt;{{cite web|url=https://andhrassolar.blogspot.com/2018/11/solar-photovoltaic-street-lightening.html|title=Solar PV street lighting system|publisher=Neelaveni.org|accessdate=2011-07-12}}{{date=November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All In One type Solar street lights are also gaining popularity. In this type the Solar panel, Lithium-ion battery and LED light are fitted together in a compact way. This enhances battery protection against theft and also the entire unit is weather proof.

City of Las Vegas was the first city in the world that tested new EnGoPlanet Solar Street lights that are coupled with kinetic tiles that produce electricity when people walk over them.

== Advantages ==
* Solar street lights are independent of the [[utility grid]]. Hence, the operation costs are minimized.
* Solar street lights require much less maintenance compared to conventional street lights.
* Since external wires are eliminated, risk of accidents are minimized.&lt;ref name=foset/&gt;
* This is a non polluting source of electricity
* Separate parts of solar system can be easily carried to the remote areas
* It allows the saving of energy and also cost.

== Disadvantages ==
* Initial investment is higher compared to conventional street lights.
* Risk of theft is higher as equipment costs are comparatively higher.&lt;ref name=foset/&gt;
* Snow or dust, combined with moisture can accumulate on horizontal PV-panels and reduce or even stop energy production.
* Rechargeable batteries will need to be replaced several times over the lifetime of the fixtures adding to the total lifetime cost of the light.
The charge and discharge cycles of the battery is also very important considering the overall cost of the project.

{{Stress v strain A36 2.svg |290px |caption=[[Stress–strain curve]] for low-[[carbon steel]]. Hooke's law (see above) is only valid for the portion of the curve between the origin and the [[yield point]] (2).}}

Structural engineering depends on the knowledge of materials and their properties, in order to understand how different materials support and resist loads.

Common structural materials are:

==Iron==

===Wrought iron===
{{main|Wrought iron}}

Wrought iron is the simplest form of iron, and is almost pure iron (typically less than 0.15% carbon). It usually contains some [[slag]]. Its uses are almost entirely obsolete, and it is no longer commercially produced.

Wrought iron is very poor in fires. It is ductile, malleable and tough. It does not [[corrosion|corrode]] as easily as steel.

===Cast iron===
{{main|Cast iron}}

Cast iron is a brittle form of iron which is weaker in tension than in compression. It has a relatively low melting point, good fluidity, castability, excellent machinability and wear resistance. Though almost entirely replaced by steel in building structures, cast irons have become an engineering material with a wide range of applications, including pipes, machine and car parts.

Cast iron retains high strength in fires, despite its low melting point. It is usually around 95% iron, with between 2.1% and 4% carbon and between 1% and 3% silicon. It does not corrode as easily as steel.

===Steel===
[[File:gateway arch.jpg|thumb|right|The 630-foot (192 m) high, stainless-clad (type 304) [[Jefferson National Expansion Memorial#The Gateway Arch|Gateway Arch]] in [[Saint Louis, Missouri]]]]
{{main|Steel|Structural steel}}
{{see also|Steel frame}}

Steel is an iron alloy with controlled level of carbon (between 0.0 and 1.7% carbon).

Steel is used extremely widely in all types of structures, due to its relatively low cost, high strength-to-weight ratio and speed of construction.

Steel is a ductile material, which will behave elastically until it reaches yield (point 2 on the stress–strain curve), when it becomes plastic and will fail in a ductile manner (large strains, or extensions, before fracture at point 3 on the curve). Steel is equally strong in tension and compression.

Steel is weak in fires, and must be protected in most buildings. Despite its high strength to weight ratio, steel buildings have as much thermal mass as similar concrete buildings.

The [[elastic modulus]] of steel is approximately 205 [[GPa]].

Steel is very prone to corrosion ([[rust]]).

===Stainless steel===
{{main|Stainless steel}}

Stainless steel is an iron-carbon alloy with a minimum of 10.5% chromium content. There are different types of stainless steel, containing different proportions of iron, carbon, [[molybdenum]], [[nickel]]. It has similar structural properties to steel, although its strength varies significantly.

It is rarely used for primary structure, and more for architectural finishes and building cladding.

It is highly resistant to corrosion and staining.

==Concrete==

[[File:Barcelona sagrada familia interno.jpg|thumb|The interior of the [[Sagrada Familia]], constructed of [[reinforced concrete]] to a design by [[Antoni Gaudí]]]]
[[File:trebar.jpg|thumb|right|A "cage" of [[rebar|reinforcing steel]]]]
{{main|Concrete}}

Concrete is used extremely widely in building and civil engineering structures, due to its low cost, flexibility, durability, and high strength. It also has high resistance to fire.

Concrete is a non-linear, non-elastic and brittle material. It is strong in compression and very weak in tension. It behaves non-linearly at all times. Because it has essentially zero strength in tension, it is almost always used as [[reinforced concrete]], a composite material. It is a mixture of [[sand]], aggregate, cement and water. It is placed in a mould, or form, as a liquid, and then it sets (goes off), due to a chemical reaction between the water and cement. The hardening of the concrete is called hydration. The reaction is exothermic (gives off heat).

Concrete increases in strength continually from the day it is cast. Assuming it is not cast under water or in constantly 100% relative humidity, it shrinks over time as it dries out, and it deforms over time due to a phenomenon called [[Creep (deformation)|creep]]. Its strength depends highly on how it is mixed, poured, cast, compacted, cured (kept wet while setting), and whether or not any admixtures were used in the mix. It can be cast into any shape that a form can be made for. Its colour, quality, and finish depend upon the complexity of the structure, the material used for the form, and the skill of the worker.

The [[elastic modulus]] of concrete can vary widely and depends on the concrete mix, age, and quality, as well as on the type and duration of loading applied to it. It is usually taken as approximately 25 [[GPa]] for long-term loads once it has attained its full strength (usually considered to be at 28 days after casting). It is taken as approximately 38 [[GPa]] for very short-term loading, such as footfalls.

Concrete has very favourable properties in fire – it is not adversely affected by fire until it reaches very high temperatures. It also has very high mass, so it is good for providing sound insulation and heat retention (leading to lower energy requirements for the heating of concrete buildings). This is offset by the fact that producing and transporting concrete is very energy intensive. To study the material behavior plenty of numerical models were developed, e.g. the [[microplane model for constitutive laws of materials]].

=== Reinforced concrete ===
{{main|Reinforced concrete}}

Reinforced concrete is concrete in which steel reinforcement bars ("rebars"), plates or fibers have been incorporated to strengthen a material that would otherwise be brittle. In industrialised countries, nearly all concrete used in construction is reinforced concrete. Due to its weakness in tension capacity, concrete will fail suddenly and in brittle manner under flexural (bending) or tensile force unless adequately reinforced with steel.

=== Prestressed concrete ===
{{main|Prestressed concrete}}

'''Prestressed concrete''' is a method for overcoming the concrete's natural weakness in [[tension (mechanics)|tension]].&lt;ref name=PrestressedConcrete&gt;{{cite book|title= Prestressed Concrete|author=Nawy, Edward G.|date=1989|publisher=[[Prentice Hall]]|isbn=0-13-698375-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=PrestressedConcreteDesign&gt;{{cite book|title= Design of Prestressed Concrete|author=Nilson, Arthur H.|date=1987|publisher=[[John Wiley &amp; Sons]]|isbn=0-471-83072-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can be used to produce [[beam (structure)|beam]]s, floors or bridges with a longer [[Span (architecture)|span]] than is practical with ordinary [[reinforced concrete]]. Prestressing tendons (generally of high [[tension (mechanics)|tensile]] steel [[wire rope|cable]] or rods) are used to provide a clamping load which produces a [[compressive stress]] that offsets the [[tensile stress]] that the concrete [[compression member]] would otherwise experience due to a bending load.

==Aluminium==
[[File:Stress v strain Aluminum 2.png|thumb|right|Stress vs. strain curve typical of aluminium&lt;br&gt;
1. Ultimate strength&lt;br&gt;
2. [[Yield strength]]&lt;br&gt;
3. Proportional Limit Stress&lt;br&gt;
4. Rupture&lt;br&gt;
5. Offset strain (typically 0.002).]]
{{main|Aluminium|Aluminium alloy}}

Aluminium is a soft, lightweight, malleable metal. The yield strength of pure aluminium is 7–11 MPa, while aluminium alloys have yield strengths ranging from 200 MPa to 600 MPa. Aluminium has about one-third the density and stiffness of steel. It is ductile, and easily machined, cast, and extruded.

Corrosion resistance is excellent due to a thin surface layer of aluminium oxide that forms when the metal is exposed to air, effectively preventing further oxidation. The strongest aluminium alloys are less corrosion resistant due to galvanic reactions with alloyed copper.

Aluminium is used in some building structures (mainly in facades) and very widely in aircraft engineering because of its good strength to weight ratio. It is a relatively expensive material.

In aircraft it is gradually being replaced by carbon composite materials.

==Composites==
[[File:rutan.variEze.g-veze.arp.jpg|thumb|right|[[VariEze|Light composite aircraft]]]]
{{main|Composite material}}

Composite materials are used increasingly in vehicles and aircraft structures, and to some extent in other structures. They are increasingly used in bridges, especially for conservation of old structures such as [[Coalport]] cast iron bridge built in 1818. Composites are often anisotropic (they have different material properties in different directions) as they can be laminar materials. They most often behave non-linearly and will fail in a brittle manner when overloaded.

They provide extremely good strength to weight ratios, but are also very expensive. The manufacturing processes, which are often extrusion, do not currently provide the economical flexibility that concrete or steel provide. The most commonly used in structural applications are [[glass-reinforced plastic]]s.

==Masonry==
[[File:Flemish Bond.jpg|thumb|A brick wall built using [[Brickwork#Flemish bond|Flemish bond]]]]
{{main|Masonry}}

Masonry has been used in structures for thousands of years, and can take the form of stone, brick or blockwork. Masonry is very strong in compression but cannot carry tension (because the [[Mortar (masonry)|mortar]] between bricks or blocks is unable to carry tension). Because it cannot carry structural tension, it also cannot carry bending, so masonry walls become unstable at relatively small heights. High masonry structures require stabilisation against lateral loads from [[buttress]]es (as with the [[flying buttress]]es seen in many European medieval churches) or from [[windpost]]s.

Historically masonry was constructed with no mortar or with lime mortar. In modern times cement based mortars are used. The mortar glues the blocks together, and also smooths out the interface between the blocks, avoiding localised point loads that might have led to cracking.

Since the widespread use of concrete, stone is rarely used as a primary structural material, often only appearing as a cladding, because of its cost and the high skills needed to produce it. Brick and concrete blockwork have taken its place.

Masonry, like concrete, has good sound insulation properties and high thermal mass, but is generally less energy intensive to produce. It is just as energy intensive as concrete to transport.

==Timber==
[[File:London, UK (August 2014) - 156.JPG|thumb|The reconstructed [[Globe Theatre]], London, by [[Buro Happold]]]]
{{main|Timber}}

Timber is the oldest of structural materials, and though mainly supplanted by steel, masonry and concrete, it is still used in a significant number of buildings. The properties of timber are non-linear and very variable, depending on the quality, treatment of wood, and type of wood supplied. The design of wooden structures is based strongly on empirical evidence.

Wood is strong in tension and compression, but can be weak in bending due to its fibrous structure. Wood is relatively good in fire as it chars, which provides the wood in the centre of the element with some protection and allows the structure to retain some strength for a reasonable length of time.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19049">The '''thermal copper pillar bump''', also known as the "thermal bump", is a thermoelectric device made from thin-film thermoelectric material embedded in [[flip chip]] interconnects (in particular copper pillar [[solder]] bumps) for use in electronics and optoelectronic  packaging, including: flip chip packaging of [[CPU]] and [[GPU]] [[integrated circuits]] (chips), [[laser diode]]s, and [[Optical amplifier#Semiconductor optical amplifier|semiconductor optical amplifiers]] (SOA). Unlike conventional solder bumps that provide an electrical path and a mechanical connection to the package, thermal bumps act as solid-state heat pumps and add thermal management functionality locally on the surface of a chip or to another electrical component. The diameter of a thermal bump is 238 μm and 60 μm high.

The thermal bump uses the [[thermoelectric effect]], which is the direct conversion of temperature differences to electric voltage and vice versa. Simply put, a thermoelectric device creates a voltage when there is a different temperature on each side, or when a voltage is applied to it, it creates a temperature difference. This effect can be used to generate electricity, to measure temperature, to cool objects, or to heat them.

For each bump, thermoelectric cooling (TEC) occurs when a current is passed through the bump. The thermal bump pulls heat from one side of the device and transfers it to the other as current is passed through the material. This is known as the [[Thermoelectric effect|Peltier]] effect.&lt;ref name="CRC"&gt;D.M. Rowe, ed. CRC Handbook of Thermoelectrics. Boca Raton, CRC Press, 1994&lt;/ref&gt; The direction of heating and cooling is determined by the direction of current flow and the sign of the [[Charge carrier|majority electrical carrier]] in the thermoelectric material.  Thermoelectric power generation (TEG) on the other hand occurs when the thermal bump is subjected to a temperature gradient (i.e., the top is hotter than the bottom).  In this instance, the device generates current, converting heat into electrical power. This is termed the [[Thermoelectric effect|Seebeck]] effect.&lt;ref name="CRC" /&gt;

The thermal bump was developed by Nextreme Thermal Solutions as a method for integrating active thermal management functionality at the chip level in the same manner that transistors, resistors and capacitors are integrated in conventional circuit designs today.   Nextreme chose the copper pillar bump as an integration strategy due to its widespread acceptance by [[Intel]], [[Amkor]] and other industry leaders as the method for connecting microprocessors and other advanced electronics devices to various surfaces during a process referred to as “flip-chip” packaging.  The thermal bump can be integrated as a part of the standard flip-chip process (Figure 1) or integrated as discrete devices.

The efficiency of a thermoelectric device is measured by the heat moved (or pumped) divided by the amount of electrical power supplied to move this heat. This ratio is termed the coefficient of performance or COP and is a measured characteristic of a thermoelectric device. The COP is inversely related to the temperature difference that the device produces. As you move a cooling device further away from the heat source, parasitic losses between the cooler and the heat source necessitate additional cooling power:  the further the distance between source and cooler, the more cooling is required.  For this reason, the cooling of electronic devices is most efficient when it occurs closest to the source of the heat generation.

Use of the thermal bump does not displace system level cooling, which is still needed to move heat out of the system; rather it introduces a fundamentally new methodology for achieving temperature uniformity at the chip and board level.  In this manner, overall thermal management of the system becomes more efficient. In addition, while conventional cooling solutions scale with the size of the system (bigger fans for bigger systems, etc.), the thermal bump can scale at the chip level by using more thermal bumps in the overall design.

==A brief history of solder and flip chip/chip scale packaging==
Solder bumping technology (the process of joining a chip to a [[Wafer (electronics)|substrate]] without shorting using solder) was first conceived and implemented by [[IBM]] in the early ‘60s.  Three versions of this type of solder joining were developed.  The first was to embed copper balls in the solder bumps to provide a positive stand-off.  The second solution, developed by [[Delco Electronics]] (General Motors) in the late ‘60s, was similar to embedding copper balls except that the design employed a rigid silver bump. The bump provided a positive stand-off and was attached to the substrate by means of solder that was screen-printed onto the substrate. The third solution was to use a screened glass dam near the [[electrode]] tips to act as a ‘‘stop-off’’ to prevent the ball solder from flowing down the electrode. By then the Ball Limiting Metallurgy (BLM) with a high-lead (Pb) solder system and a copper ball had proven to work well. Therefore, the ball was simply removed and the solder evaporation process extended to form pure solder bumps that were approximately 125μm high. This system became known as the controlled collapse chip connection (C3 or C4).

Until the mid-90’s, this type of flip-chip assembly was practiced almost exclusively by IBM and Delco.  Around this time, Delco sought to commercialize its technology and formed [[Delco Electronics|Flip Chip Technologies]] with Kulicke &amp; Soffa Industries as a partner.  At the same time, MCNC (which had developed a plated version of IBM’s C4 process) received funding from [[DARPA]] to commercialize its technology. These two organizations, along with APTOS (Advanced Plating Technologies on Silicon), formed the nascent out-sourcing market.

During this same time, companies began to look at reducing or streamlining their packaging, from the earlier multi-chip-on-ceramic packages that IBM had originally developed C4 to support, to what were referred to as [[chip scale package|Chip Scale Packages]] (CSP).  There were a number of companies developing products in this area.  These products could usually be put into one of two camps: either they were scaled down versions of the multi-chip on ceramic package (of which the Tessera package would be one example); or they were the streamlined versions developed by Unitive Electronics, et al. (where the package wiring had been transferred to the chip, and after bumping, they were ready to be placed).

One of the issues with the CSP type of package (which was intended to be soldered directly to an FR4 or flex circuit) was that for high-density interconnects, the soft solder bump provided less of a stand-off as the solder bump diameter and pitch were decreased.  Different solutions were employed including one developed by Focus Interconnect Technology (former APTOS engineers), which used a high aspect ratio plated copper post to provide a larger fixed standoff than was possible for a soft solder collapse joint.

Today, flip chip is a well established technology and collapsed soft solder connections are used in the vast majority of assemblies.  The copper post stand-off developed for the CSP market has found a home in high-density interconnects for advanced micro-processors and is used today by IBM for its CPU packaging.

==Copper pillar solder bumping==
Recent trends in high-density interconnects have led to the use of copper pillar solder bumps (CPB) for CPU and GPU packaging.&lt;ref&gt;J. Kloeser and E. Weibach, “High-Performance Flip Chip Packages with Copper Pillar Bumping,” Global SMT &amp; Packaging, May 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;  CPBs are an attractive replacement for traditional solder bumps because they provide a fixed stand-off independent of pitch. This is extremely important as most of the high-end products are underfilled and a smaller standoff may create difficulties in getting the underfill adhesive to flow under the die.

Figure 2 shows an example of a CPB fabricated by Intel and incorporated into their [[Pentium D|Presler]] line of microprocessors among others. The cross section shows copper and a copper pillar (approximately 60&amp;nbsp;um high) electrically connected through an opening (or via) in the chip [[Passivation (chemistry)|passivation layer]] at the top of the picture.  At the bottom is another copper trace on the package substrate with solder between the two copper layers.

[[Image:intel-presler-copper-pillar-bump.png|thumb | Figure 2. Intel Presler copper pillar solder bump.]]

==Thin-film thermoelectric technology==
Thin films are thin material layers ranging from fractions of a nanometer to several micrometers in thickness. Thin-film thermoelectric materials are grown by conventional semiconductor deposition methods and fabricated using conventional semiconductor micro-fabrication techniques.

Thin-film thermoelectrics have been demonstrated to provide high heat pumping capacity that far exceeds the capacities provided by traditional bulk pellet TE products.&lt;ref&gt;G.J. Snyder, M. Soto, R. Alley, D. Koester, B. Conner, ”Hot Spot Cooling using Embedded Thermoelectric Coolers,”  Proc. 22nd IEEE Semi-Therm Symp., 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;  The benefit of thin-films versus bulk materials for thermoelectric manufacturing is expressed in Equation 1.  Here the Qmax (maximum heat pumped by a module) is shown to be inversely proportional to the thickness of the film, L.

&lt;math&gt;Q_{max}=\frac{S^2T^2}{2\cdot R_{Total}}=\frac{S^2T^2A}{2p_cL}&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Eq. 1

As such, TE coolers manufactured with thin-films can easily have 10x – 20x higher Qmax values for a given active area A. This makes thin-film TECs ideally suited for applications involving high heat-flux flows. In addition to the increased heat pumping capability, the use of thin films allows for truly novel implementation of TE devices. Instead of a bulk module that is 1-3&amp;nbsp;mm in thickness, a thin-film TEC can be fabricated less than 100&amp;nbsp;um in thickness.

In its simplest form, the P or N leg of a TE couple (the basic building block of all thin-film TE devices) is a layer of thin-film TE material with a solder layer above and below, providing electrical and thermal functionality.

==Thermal copper pillar bump==
The thermal bump is compatible with the existing flip-chip manufacturing infrastructure, extending the use of conventional solder bumped interconnects to provide active, integrated cooling of a flip-chipped component using the widely accepted copper pillar bumping process. The result is higher performance and efficiency within the existing semiconductor manufacturing paradigm. The thermal bump also enables power generating capabilities within copper pillar bumps for energy recycling applications.

Thermal bumps have been shown to achieve a temperature differential of 60 °C between the top and bottom headers; demonstrated power pumping capabilities exceeding 150 W/cm2; and when subjected to heat, have demonstrated the capability to generate up to 10 mW of power per bump.

==Thermal copper pillar bump structure==
Figure 3 shows an SEM cross-section of a TE leg.  Here it is demonstrated that the thermal bump is structurally identical to a CPB with an extra layer, the TE layer, incorporated into the stack-up. The addition of the TE layer transforms a standard copper pillar bump into a thermal bump.  This element, when properly configured electrically and thermally, provides active thermoelectric heat transfer from one side of the bump to the other side.  The direction of heat transfer is dictated by the doping type of the thermoelectric material (either a P-type or N-type semiconductor) and the direction of electric current passing through the material. This type of thermoelectric heat transfer is known as the Peltier effect. Conversely, if heat is allowed to pass from one side of the thermoelectric material to the other, a current will be generated in the material in a phenomenon known as the Seebeck effect. The Seebeck effect is essentially the reverse of the Peltier effect. In this mode, electrical power is generated from the flow of heat in the TE element. The structure shown in Figure 3 is capable of operating in both the Peltier and Seebeck modes, though not simultaneously.

[[Image:cross-section-thermal-bump.png|thumb | Figure 3. Cross sectional view of Nextreme’s thermal copper pillar bump.]]

Figure 4 shows a schematic of a typical CPB and a thermal bump for comparison.  These structures are similar, with both having copper pillars and solder connections.  The primary difference between the two is the introduction of either a P- or N-type thermoelectric layer between two solder layers.  The solders used with CPBs and thermal bumps can be any one of a number of commonly used solders including, but not limited to, Sn, SnPb eutectic, SnAg or AuSn.

[[Image:cpb-thermal-bump.png|thumb | Figure 4. Schematic showing traditional CPB next to a P-type and N-type pillar bump.  The P- and N-type bumps together make up a P/N couple that, when connected in series electrically, provides for either Peltier cooling or Seebeck power generation.]]

Figure 5 shows a device equipped with a thermal bump. The thermal flow is shown by the arrows labeled “heat.” Metal traces, which can be several micrometres high, can be stacked or interdigitated to provide highly conductive pathways for collecting heat from the underlying circuit and funneling that heat to the thermal bump.

[[Image:thermal-bump-thermal-flow.png|thumb | Figure 5. Close-up schematic showing flow of heat through a thermal bump.  Also shown are the multi-layer metal traces often used in complex integrated circuits.  These metal layers can be beneficial for gathering heat from larger areas and funneling it into the thermal bump, reducing the thermal constriction resistance in the circuit.  A thermal via is shown in the printed wire board for improved heat rejection path.]]

The metal traces shown in the figure for conducting electric current into the thermal bump may or may not be directly connected to the circuitry of the chip.  In the case where there are electrical connections to the chip circuitry, on-board temperature sensors and driver circuitry can be used to control the thermal bump in a closed loop fashion to maintain optimal performance.  Second, the heat that is pumped by the thermal bump and the additional heat created by the thermal bump in the course of pumping that heat will need to be rejected into the substrate or board.  Since the performance of the thermal bump can be improved by providing a good thermal path for the rejected heat, it is beneficial to provide high thermally conductive pathways on the backside of the thermal bump.  The substrate could be a highly conductive ceramic substrate like AlN or a metal (e.g., Cu, CuW, CuMo, etc.) with a dielectric. In this case, the high thermal conductance of the substrate will act as a natural pathway for the rejected heat. The substrate might also be a multilayer substrate like a printed wiring board (PWB) designed to provide a high-density interconnect.  In this case, the thermal conductivity of the PWB may be relatively poor, so adding thermal vias (e.g. metal plugs) can provide excellent pathways for the rejected heat.

==Applications==
Thermal bumps can be used in a number of different ways to provide chip cooling and power generation.

===General cooling===
Thermal bumps can be evenly distributed across the surface of a chip to provide a uniform cooling effect.  In this case, the thermal bumps may be interspersed with standard bumps that are used for signal, power and ground.  This allows the thermal bumps to be placed directly under the active circuitry of the chip for maximum effectiveness. The number and density of thermal bumps are based on the heat load from the chip.  Each P/N couple can provide a specific heat pumping (Q) at a specific temperature differential (ΔT) at a given electric current.  Temperature sensors on the chip (“on board” sensors) can provide direct measurement of the thermal bump performance and provide feedback to the driver circuit.

===Precision temperature control===
Since thermal bumps can either cool or heat the chip depending on the current direction, they can be used to provide precision control of temperature for chips that must operate within specific temperature ranges irrespective of ambient conditions.  For example, this is a common problem for many optoelectronic components.

===Hotspot cooling===
In microprocessors, graphics processors and other high-end chips, hotspots can occur as power densities vary significantly across a chip.&lt;ref&gt;A. Bar-Cohen, University of Maryland, “Enhanced Thermoelectric Cooler for On-Chip Hot Spot Cooling” presentation, IntePACK’07: ASME/Pacific Rim Technical Conference and Exhibition on Packaging and Integration of Electronic and Photonic Systems, MEMS, and NEMS, July 8-12, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;  These hotspots can severely limit the performance of the devices.  Because of the small size of the thermal bumps and the relatively high density at which they can be placed on the active surface of the chip, these structures are ideally suited for cooling hotspots.  In such a case, the distribution of the thermal bumps may not need to be even.  Rather, the thermal bumps would be concentrated in the area of the hotspot while areas of lower heat density would have fewer thermal bumps per unit area.  In this way, cooling from the thermal bumps is applied only where needed, thereby reducing the added power necessary to drive the cooling and reducing the general thermal overhead on the system.

===Power generation===
In addition to chip cooling, thermal bumps can also be applied to high heat-flux interconnects to provide a constant, steady source of power for energy scavenging applications. Such a source of power, typically in the mW range, can trickle charge batteries for wireless sensor networks and other battery operated systems.

:''Kundo reverts here. For other use, see [[Kundo (disambiguation)]]''
A '''torsion pendulum clock''', more commonly known as an '''anniversary clock''' or '''400-day clock''', is a mechanical [[clock]] which keeps time with a mechanism called a [[Torsion spring|torsion pendulum]].  This is a weighted disk or wheel, often a decorative wheel with 3 or 4 chrome balls on ornate spokes, suspended by a thin wire or ribbon called a [[torsion spring]] (also known as "suspension spring").  The torsion pendulum rotates about the vertical axis of the wire, twisting it, instead of swinging like an ordinary [[pendulum]].  The force of the twisting torsion spring reverses the direction of rotation, so the torsion pendulum oscillates slowly, clockwise and counterclockwise.  The clock's gears apply a pulse of [[torque]] to the top of the torsion spring with each rotation to keep the wheel going. The wheel and torsion spring function similarly to a [[watch]]'s [[balance wheel]] and [[Balance spring|hairspring]], as a [[harmonic oscillator]] to control the rate of the clock's hands.

==Description==
Torsion clocks are usually delicate, ornamental, [[Mainspring|spring-wound]] [[mantel clock]]s.  The polished clock mechanism is exposed under a glass case or dome, to allow people to watch the torsion pendulum turn.  Clocks of this style, first made by Anton Harder around 1880,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Four Hundred Day Clock |work=Encyclopedia of Antiques | publisher=Old and Sold Antique Marketplace | url=http://www.oldandsold.com/articles02/clocks-f.shtml | accessdate=2008-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; are also known as '''400-day''' or '''anniversary''' clocks, because many can run for an entire year on a single winding. This does not mean they will keep accurate time the whole year. It's best to wind the clock once a month. But some models will run up to 1000 days on a single winding.

==Mechanism==
Torsion clocks are capable of running much longer between windings than clocks with an ordinary pendulum, because the torsion pendulum rotates slowly and takes little energy.  However they are difficult to set up and are usually not as accurate as clocks with ordinary pendulums.  One reason is that the oscillation period of the torsion pendulum changes with temperature due to temperature-dependent change in elasticity  of the spring.  The rate of the clock can be made faster or slower by an adjustment screw mechanism on the torsion pendulum that moves the weight balls in or out from the axis.  The closer in the balls are, the smaller the [[moment of inertia]] of the torsion pendulum and the faster it will turn, like a spinning ice skater who pulls in her arms.  This causes the clock to speed up.

One oscillation of the torsion pendulum usually takes 12, 15, or 20 seconds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite mailing list

  | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[escapement]] mechanism, that changes the rotational motion of the clock's gears to pulses to drive the torsion pendulum, works rather like an [[anchor escapement]].  A crutch device at the top of the torsion spring engages a lever with two anchor-shaped arms; the arms in turn alternately engage the teeth of the escape wheel.  As the anchor releases a tooth of the escape wheel, the lever, which is fixed to the anchor, moves to one side and, via the crutch, gives a small twist to the top of the torsion spring.  This is just enough to keep the oscillation going.

The [[Atmos clock]], made by Jaeger Le Coultre, is a type of torsion clock which doesn't need to be wound or powered at all.  The [[mainspring]] which turns the clock's wheels is kept wound by small changes in atmospheric pressure and/or local temperature, using a [[bellows]] mechanism.  Thus no winding key or battery is needed, and it can run for years without human intervention.

==History==
The torsion pendulum was invented by Robert Leslie in 1793.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Torsion Pendulum |work=Encyclopedia of Antiques | publisher=Old and Sold Antique Marketplace | url=http://www.oldandsold.com/articles02/clocks-t.shtml | accessdate=2008-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The torsion pendulum clock was first invented and patented by American Aaron Crane in 1841.&lt;ref name="Connolly"&gt;{{cite web

The German Anton Harder apparently independently invented and patented the torsion clock in 1879-1880.&lt;ref name="Connolly" /&gt;  He was inspired by watching a hanging chandelier rotate after a servant had turned it to light the candles.   He formed the firm Jahresuhrenfabrik ('Year Clock Factory') and designed a clock that would run for a year, but its accuracy was poor.  He sold the patent in 1884 to F. A. L. deGruyter of Amsterdam, who allowed the patent to expire in 1887.  Other firms entered the market, beginning the German mass production of these clocks.

Although they were successful commercially, torsion clocks remained poor timekeepers.  In 1951, Charles Terwilliger of the Horolovar Co. invented a temperature compensating suspension spring, which allowed fairly accurate clocks to be made.

'''USS ''Triton'' (SSRN/SSN-586)''', a [[United States Navy]] [[radar picket]] [[nuclear submarine]].  In early 1960 it became the first vessel to execute a submerged [[circumnavigation]] of the Earth ([[Operation Sandblast]]). ''Triton'' accomplished this objective during her [[shakedown cruise]] while under the command of Captain [[Edward L. Beach, Jr.|Edward L. "Ned" Beach, Jr]].  The only member of her [[Ship class|class]], she also had the distinction of being the only Western submarine powered by two nuclear reactors.

''Triton'' was the second submarine and the fifth ship of the United States Navy to be named for the Greek god [[Triton (mythology)|Triton]]. At the time of her [[Ship commissioning|commissioning]] in 1959, ''Triton'' was the largest, most powerful, and most expensive submarine ever built, at $109&amp;nbsp;million excluding the cost of nuclear fuel and reactors (${{Formatprice|{{Inflation|US|109000000|1959}}}} in present-day terms{{Inflation-fn|US}}).

After operating for only two years in her designed role, ''Triton''{{'}}s mission as a radar picket submarine was made obsolete by the introduction of the carrier-based Grumman [[E-1 Tracer|WF-2 Tracer]] [[airborne early warning]] aircraft.  Converted to an [[attack submarine]] in 1962, she became the [[flagship]] for the [[ComSubLant|Commander, Submarine Forces, U.S. Atlantic Fleet]] (&lt;small&gt;COMSUBLANT&lt;/small&gt;) in 1964. She was decommissioned in 1969, the first U.S. nuclear submarine to be taken out of service.

''Triton''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s hull was moored at the [[St. Julien's Creek Annex]] of [[Norfolk Naval Shipyard]] in [[Portsmouth, Virginia]] as part of the reserve fleet until 1993, though she was struck from the [[Naval Vessel Register]] in 1986. In 1993, she was towed to [[Puget Sound Naval Shipyard]] to await the [[Nuclear Powered Ship and Submarine Recycling Program]].  The former ''Triton'' landed on the keel resting blocks in the drydock basin on 1 October 2007 to begin this recycling process which was completed effective 30 November 2009. The USS Triton's sail superstructure was saved from the recycling process and is now part of the USS Triton Submarine Memorial Park located on Port of Benton Blvd in Richland Washington [https://www.google.com/maps/@46.348668,-119.2699297,3a,60y,28.61h,77.11t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sXwgUQwDyaDDegXj31SfBXg!2e0!7i13312!8i6656].

==Design history==

===General characteristics===
''Triton'' is considered a first-generation U.S. [[nuclear-powered submarine]], along with {{USS|Nautilus|SSN-571|2}}, {{USS|Seawolf|SSN-575|2}}, {{USS|Halibut|SSGN-587|2}}, and {{USS|Skate|SSN-578|2}} (and her [[Skate class submarine|sisters]]).&lt;ref&gt;[[Norman Polmar|Polmar]] and Moore. ''Cold War Submarines'', p.xiii, and Chapter 4, pp. 90–93.&lt;/ref&gt; While serving as fully operational units of the U.S. Navy, the vessels also played key developmental roles.&lt;ref&gt;Polmar and Moore. ''Cold War Submarines'', p. 66.&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Nautilus'' introduced the use of nuclear power for ship propulsion.&lt;ref&gt;Polmar and Moore. ''Cold War Submarines'', pp. 57–60.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Seawolf'' utilized a [[liquid metal cooled reactor|liquid-metal nuclear reactor]] using [[liquid sodium]] as an alternative heat exchange medium to pressurized water.&lt;ref&gt;Polmar and Moore. ''Cold War Submarines'', pp. 60–63.&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Halibut'' was the first nuclear-powered submarine to perform a strategic [[Deterrence theory|nuclear deterrence]] patrol armed with [[SSM-N-8 Regulus|Regulus]] [[cruise missile]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Polmar and Moore. ''Cold War Submarines'', pp. 90–93.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Skate''s were the first nuclear-powered submarine class with more than one ship built.&lt;ref&gt;Polmar and Moore. ''Cold War Submarines'', pp. 63–64.&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Triton''{{'}}s unique contribution to the development of nuclear power for naval propulsion was her dual reactor plant, which provided the speed required for radar picket missions.&lt;ref&gt;Polmar and Moore. ''Cold War Submarines'', pp. 64–66.&lt;/ref&gt;

Radar picket submarines ([[Hull classification symbol|Navy classification]] "SSR") were developed during the post-war period to provide intelligence information, electronic surveillance, and fighter aircraft interception control for forward-deployed naval forces. Unlike destroyers used as radar picket ships during World War Two, these submarines could avoid attack by submerging if detected. The U.S. Navy's MIGRAINE&lt;ref name=UnderseaWarfare /&gt; program involved converting existing fleet submarines into radar picket vessels, and the Navy also ordered two purpose-built diesel-electric SSRs, {{USS|Sailfish|SSR-572|2}} and {{USS|Salmon|SSR-573|2}}.  However, these were incapable of sustaining the high submerged or surfaced speeds necessary to operate with fast carrier task forces and therefore unsuitable to the task.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, ''U.S. Submarines Since 1945'', pp.90–94.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nuclear power offered the only possible solution.  ''Triton'' was designed in the mid-1950s as a radar picket submarine capable of operating at high speed, on the surface, in advance of an aircraft carrier task force. ''Triton''{{'}}s high speed came from her twin-reactor nuclear propulsion plant, with a designed speed, surfaced and submerged, of {{convert|28|kn|mph km/h|abbr=on}}. On 27 September 1959, ''Triton'' achieved "well in excess of" {{convert|30|kn|mph km/h|abbr=on}} during her initial sea trials.&lt;ref name=Polmar67&gt;Polmar and Moore. ''Cold War Submarines'', p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Largess and Horwitz. "USS ''Triton'': The Ultimate Submersible," pp.178 and 180.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:USS Triton CIC.jpg|thumb|left|''Triton''{{'}}s Combat Information Center (CIC), displaying status board and radar consoles|alt=Men stand at various terminals scattered around a cramped room]]

To meet her radar picket role, ''Triton''{{'}}s main air search radar initially used the AN/SPS-26, the U.S. Navy's first electronically scanned, three-dimensional search radar which was laboratory tested in 1953. The first set was installed on board the [[destroyer leader]] [[USS Norfolk (DL-1)|''Norfolk'']] prior to its installation on board ''Triton'' in 1959.&lt;ref&gt;Polmar. ''The Naval Institute Guide to the Ships and Aircraft of the U.S. Fleet'', p. 527.&lt;/ref&gt; Since it was scanned electronically in elevation, the AN/SPS-26 set did not need a separate height-finding radar.  A submarine version of SPS-26, designated BPS-10, was under development, and it was slated for installation on ''Triton''.  To process its radar, electronic, and air traffic data, ''Triton'' had a Combat Information Center (CIC) located in a separate air control compartment, situated between ''Triton''{{'}}s reactor and operations compartments.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman. ''U.S. Submarines since 1945'', pp. 95–96.&lt;/ref&gt;

Design work on a nuclear-powered radar picket submarine (SSRN) began in 1954–1955.&lt;ref name=Friedman95&gt;Friedman. ''U.S. Submarines since 1945'', p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt; As initially designed, it had a three-level hull, with its Combat Intelligence Center (CIC) (''see image'') located on the middle level.&lt;ref name=Friedman95/&gt;  Its overall length was initially {{convert|400|ft|m}}, with a beam of {{convert|38|ft|m}}.&lt;ref name=Friedman95/&gt;  Also as initially designed, its displacement was 4800 tons surfaced and 6500 tons submerged.&lt;ref name=Friedman95/&gt;  January 1955 performance estimates called for the SAR propulsion plant to produce 34,000 shaft horsepower, with a surfaced speed of {{convert|27|kn|mph km/h|abbr=on}} and a submerged speed of {{convert|23|kn|mph km/h|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=Friedman95/&gt;  ''Triton'' initially had the same dual radar system installed on the non-nuclear [[Sailfish class submarine|''Sailfish''-class]] radar picket submarines (i.e., BPS-2 search radar and BPS-3 height-finder set) housed in a large, stepped [[sail (submarine)|sail]] (''see image'').&lt;ref name=Friedman95/&gt;  Construction cost was initially estimated at $78,000,000.&lt;ref name=Friedman95/&gt;  Subsequent growth of the SAR propulsion plant necessitated the overall increase in ''Triton''{{'}}s length and tonnage, although without any loss in speed,  while the installation of the AN/SPS-26 3-D search radar allowed the elimination of a separate height-finder.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman. ''U.S. Submarines since 1945'', pp. 95–96, 256n3, 263n10.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Triton'' was to be the lead ship of a proposed class of nuclear-powered radar picket submarines. A December 1955 long-range naval planning report envisioned five carrier strike groups, each supported by two radar picket submarines. The total force included two non-nuclear ''Sailfish'' class submarines and eight nuclear submarines. With construction costs for ''Triton'' escalating, this long-range requirement was revised in 1957 to provide four nuclear-powered radar picket submarines for a single nuclear-powered carrier group, with the four remaining conventionally powered carrier groups supported by two diesel-electric radar picket submarines each.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman. ''U.S. Submarines since 1945'', p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time of her construction, ''Triton'' was the largest submarine ever built. Her knife-like bow, with its bulbous forefoot, provided improved surfaced sea-keeping for her radar picket role. Her surface sea-keeping was further enhanced by high reserve buoyancy (30%), provided by 22 [[ballast tanks]], the most ever in an American submarine.&lt;ref name=Polmar67/&gt; She was the last submarine to have a [[conning tower]], as well as the last American submarine to have twin screws or a stern torpedo room.  Her sail was the largest ever aboard an American submarine, measuring {{convert|70|ft|m}} long, {{convert|24|ft|m}} tall, and {{convert|12|ft|m}} wide, and designed to house the large AN/SPS-26 3-D air-search radar antenna when not in use. She also had a compartment solely for crew berthing, with 96 bunks, and two separate chief petty officers' (CPOs') quarters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last= Boe | first= David | title= Operation Sandblast – TRITON Remembered – 40 Years Later | url= http://diodon349.com/Stories/Stories_SS/Operation_Sandblast_TRITON_Remembered_40_Years_Later.htm | year= 2000 | work= American Submariner Magazine | publisher= [[USSVI]] | accessdate= 2010-03-08 | deadurl= yes | archiveurl= https://www.webcitation.org/6ACiiSRT5?url=http://diodon349.com/Stories/Stories_SS/Operation_Sandblast_TRITON_Remembered_40_Years_Later.htm | archivedate= 26 August 2012 | df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  With an overall length of {{convert|447.5|ft|m}}, ''Triton'' was the longest submarine in the history of the United States Navy until the nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarine {{USS|Ohio|SSBN-726}} was commissioned in 1981.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/systems/ship/ssn-586.htm |title=USS ''Triton'' (SSRN-586) |accessdate=2008-09-13 |work= U.S. Warships |publisher=GlobalSecurity.org |date=9 March 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Propulsion===
''Triton'' was the only submarine outside of the Soviet Union designed with a two-reactor propulsion plant.  Her [[S4G reactor]]s were seagoing versions of the land-based [[S3G reactor]] prototype.  Both reactors comprised the Submarine Advanced Reactor (SAR) program, a joint venture between the U.S. Navy, [[United States Atomic Energy Commission|Atomic Energy Commission]] (AEC), and [[General Electric]].&lt;ref&gt;Polmar and Moore. ''Cold War Submarines'', p. 64; Appendix C.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Freidman125&gt;Friedman. ''U.S. Submarines Since 1945'', p. 125.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= The Rickover Effect: How One Man Made a Difference |last= Rockwell |first= Theodore |year= 1992 |publisher= [[United States Naval Institute|Naval Institute Press]] |location=Annapolis|isbn= 978-1-55750-702-0 |page= 160}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Largess174178&gt;Largess and Horwitz. "USS ''Triton'': The Ultimate Submersible," pp. 174–178.&lt;/ref&gt;  As originally designed, ''Triton''{{'}}s total reactor output was rated at {{convert|34000|hp}}. However, ''Triton'' achieved {{convert|45000|hp}} during her sea trials (''pictured''), and her first commanding officer, Captain Edward L. Beach, Jr., believed ''Triton''{{'}}s plant could have reached {{convert|60000|hp}} "had that been necessary."&lt;ref name=Polmar67/&gt;
[[File:USS Triton SSRN586 0858601.jpg|thumb|left|Sea trials (27 September 1959)|alt=A surfaced submarine is seen from above and to port making high speed, with a long wake around and behind.]]
Both of ''Triton''{{'}}s reactors share the same compartment, with its number one reactor located forward and its number two reactor located aft within that compartment.  The number one reactor supplied steam to the forward engine room and the starboard propeller shaft. The number two reactor supplied steam to the after engine room and the port propeller shaft. Each reactor could individually supply steam for the entire ship, or the reactors could be cross-connected as required.&lt;ref&gt;Beach. ''Around the World Submerged''. p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;  It is this enhanced reliability, redundancy, and dependability of its dual-reactor plant that was a key factor in the selection of ''Triton'' to undertake the [[Operation Sandblast|first submerged circumnavigation of the world]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;First Submerged Circumnavigation 1960, B-5.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Triton''{{'}}s dual-reactor plant met a number of operational and engineering objectives, specifically the high speed requirement to meet its radar picket mission, which continues to be sources of speculation and controversy to this day. During the early 1950s, many engineers at [[Naval Reactors|Naval Reactors branch]] of the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) were concerned about depending on single-reactor plants for submarine operations, particularly involving under-the-ice Arctic missions.&lt;ref&gt;Polmar and Moore. ''Cold War Submarines'', pp. 65, 68.&lt;/ref&gt;  The presence of two de-aerating feed tanks, which are used only on surface warships, suggested that ''Triton''{{'}}s twin-reactor plant may have served as a testbed for future multi-reactor surface warships.&lt;ref&gt;Beach. ''Salt and Steel'', p. 263.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Largess and Horwitz. "USS ''Triton'': The Ultimate Submersible," p. 179.&lt;/ref&gt;  The SAR program was the first production naval reactor developed by General Electric for the U.S. Navy, and GE used this SAR experience for the High Power Reactor (HPR) program that led to the development of the [[D1G reactor|D1G]] and [[D2G reactor|D2G]] naval reactors used on {{USS|Bainbridge|CGN-25|2}}, {{USS|Truxtun|CGN-35|2}}, [[California class cruiser|''California'']], and [[Virginia class cruiser|''Virginia'']] classes of nuclear-powered surface ships.&lt;ref name=Friedman95/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Largess and Horwitz. "USS ''Triton'': The Ultimate Submersible," p. 178.&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, the U.S. Navy was debating the best approach to optimize performance, particularly underwater speed, for its nuclear submarine fleet. ''Triton'' achieved high speeds through brute horsepower, rather than the more hydrodynamically efficient teardrop-shaped hull form pioneered by {{USS|Albacore|AGSS-569|2}} which, when combined with nuclear power, allowed {{USS|Skipjack|SSN-585|2}} to achieve higher speed with less horsepower.&lt;ref name=Largess174178/&gt;

===Combat systems===

[[File:USS-Triton1.jpg|thumb|right|Undated bow view of USS ''Triton''|alt=Large submarine surface displaying its bow, upper deck, and large conning tower]]

====Weapon systems====
''Triton''{{'}}s armament consisted of six Mark 60 torpedo tubes, four bow and two stern. The Mark 60 system was a {{convert|249.8|in|mm|adj=on}}-long hydraulic-launch tube that did not have power handling capability. The standard torpedo carried by ''Triton'' was the [[Mark 37 torpedo|Mark 37]], with a weapon load of ten forward and five aft.&lt;ref name=Friedman243/&gt; ''Triton''{{'}}s first commanding officer, "Ned" Beach, noted the torpedo load in the forward torpedo room could have been doubled with the removal of a single support girder.&lt;ref&gt;Largess and Horwitz. "USS ''Triton'': The Ultimate Submersible." ''Warship 1993'',&lt;!--publisher &amp; place?--&gt; p. 179.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Fire control and electronics====
''Triton''{{'}}s main air search radar was the [[Passive electronically scanned array|electronically scanned]], [[3D radar|three-dimensional]] AN/SPS-26.  This system had a range of {{convert|65|nmi|km mi}} and was capable of tracking aircraft up to an altitude of {{convert|75000|ft|m}}.&lt;ref name=Polmar67/&gt; Since it scanned electronically in elevation, it did not need a separate height-finding set.&lt;ref name=UnderseaWarfare&gt;{{cite magazine |url=http://www.public.navy.mil/subfor/underseawarfaremagazine/Issues/Archives/issue_14/coldwar.html |title=Cold War Curiosities: U.S. Radar Picket Submarines |accessdate=2008-09-13 |magazine=Undersea Warfare Magazine |publisher= U.S. Navy |date=Winter–Spring 2002 |volume=4 |issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When not in use, the SPS-26 radar was lowered into its fairwater housing for stowage within ''Triton''{{'}}s massive [[Sail (submarine)|sail]] (''pictured'').&lt;ref name=Polmar67/&gt; A submarine version of SPS-26, designated BPS-10, was under development at the time of ''Triton''{{'}}s construction, slated for eventual installation on ''Triton''.&lt;ref name=Friedman9596253n11&gt;Friedman. ''U.S. Submarines since 1945'', p. 95–96, 253n6.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Triton''{{'}}s long-range, passive detecting-ranging sonar was the AN/BQR-7, which had a listening range up to {{convert|20|nmi|km mi}} for surfaced or snorkeling submarines, optimized to {{convert|35|nmi|km mi}}, with target tracking capability within 5 degrees of accuracy.&lt;ref name=Friedman243&gt;Friedman. ''U.S. Submarines since 1945'', p. 243.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Polmar18&gt;Polmar and Moore. ''Cold War Submarines'', p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;US NAVY Sonar school&lt;/ref&gt; The chin-mounted AN/BQR-2 [[passive sonar]] array supplemented the active BQS-4, with a range up to {{convert|10|nmi|km mi}} and a bearing accuracy of 1/10 of degree, allowing the BQR-2 to be used for fire control in torpedo attacks.&lt;ref name=Friedman243/&gt;&lt;ref name=Polmar18/&gt;

''Triton''{{'}}s [[Fire-control|target fire-control system]] (TFCS) was the Mark 101, a post-war development that incorporated target tracking and ranging data into a position keeper, with a pair of analyzers that automatically revised torpedo gyros and settings as the target position changed.&lt;ref name=Freidman109&gt;Friedman. ''U.S. Submarines since 1945'', p. 109.&lt;/ref&gt; This automation greatly simplified a targeting solution for a plotting party.  Previously targeting solutions were manually estimated target bearings which were then fed into the [[Torpedo Data Computer]] (TDC), a method used throughout the [[Pacific War]].&lt;ref name=Freidman109/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=U.S. Submarines through 1945: An Illustrated Design History |last=Friedman |first=Norman |year=1995 |publisher=[[United States Naval Institute|Naval Institute Press]] |location=Annapolis, Maryland |isbn=1-55750-263-3 |pages=193–197}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, while entirely capable of providing efficient fire control solutions against post-war non-nuclear hunter-killer submarines, the Mark 101 proved to be less responsive to the rapid changes associated with nuclear submarine operations.&lt;ref name=Freidman109/&gt;

The Number One periscope was ''Triton''{{'}}s navigational periscope, and it had a built-in [[sextant]] developed by the Kollmorgen Optical Company that allowed navigators to observe celestial bodies in order to obtain an accurate star fix to plot the ship's course and position.&lt;ref&gt;First Submerged Circumnavigation 1960, B-7.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Beach. ''Around the World Submerged'', pp. 85–86.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Construction history==
[[File:Triton SSRN-586 launch.jpg|thumb|right|Launch of USS ''Triton'' (19 August 1958)|alt=From an inclined launching slipway, Triton slides into the water, creating a large disturbance.]]

===Authorization===
The U.S. Navy ordered a "large radar picket using the advanced two-reactor system," designated SCB 132, in October 1955 under the [[U.S. Department of Defense]] appropriation for [[Fiscal Year]] 1956.&lt;ref name=Largess172173&gt;Largess and Horwitz. "USS Triton: The Ultimate Submersible," pp. 172–173.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=USFleetAppC&gt;Polmar, ''The Naval Institute Guide to the Ships and Aircraft of the U.S. Fleet'', Appendix C.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Polamr65&gt;Polmar and Moore. ''Cold War Submarines'', p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt; This 1956 shipbuilding program was significant because it included authorization for the construction of eight submarines in total, the largest such order since [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;Polmar and Moore. Cold War Submarines, pp. 353–354n43.&lt;/ref&gt;  Along with ''Triton'', the FY-56 program included four additional nuclear-powered submarines – [[USS Halibut (SSGN-587)|guided missile submarine ''Halibut'']], the [[USS Skipjack (SSN-585)|lead ship]] for the [[Skipjack class submarine|''Skipjack'' class]], and the final two [[Skate class submarine|''Skate''-class attack submarines]], [[USS Sargo (SSN-583)|''Sargo'']] and [[USS Seadragon (SSN-584)|''Seadragon'']]. The 1956 program not only completed the final authorization for all of the U.S. Navy's first-generation nuclear submarines, but with ''Skipjack'', it also marked the initial authorization for a second-generation nuclear submarine. Finally, the 1956 program included the three submarines of the  diesel-electric [[Barbel class submarine|''Barbel'' class]], the last non-nuclear attack submarines to be built for the U.S. Navy. Henceforth, the U.S. Navy submarine service would be a nuclear-powered force.&lt;ref name=USFleetAppC/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Polmar and Moore. ''Cold War Submarines'', p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Keel-laying===
''Triton''{{'}}s keel was laid down on 29 May 1956 in [[Groton, Connecticut]], by the [[Electric Boat]] Division of the General Dynamics Corporation. Her length presented Electric Boat with many problems during her construction. She was so long her bow obstructed the slipway's railway facility, used for transporting material around the yard. Consequently, the lower half of her bow was cut away to facilitate yard operations, and the bow was re-attached just days prior to her launch. Similarly, the last {{convert|50|ft|m}} of her stern was built on an adjoining slip and attached to the rest of the hull before ''Triton''{{'}}s launch. Her sail was found to be too high to go under the scaffolding, so the top {{convert|12|ft|m}} was cut away and re-attached later.&lt;ref&gt;Beach. ''Around the World Submerged'', pp. 4–6.&lt;/ref&gt;

Even before her launch, there was considerable discussion of ''Triton''{{'}}s role beyond her radar picket mission. An internal Navy memorandum set forth four options for the submarine's extended use. These included configuration to serve as a [[command ship]] (SSCN) for a fleet or force commander, an advanced [[sonar]] scout for the fleet, a Regulus missile submarine ([[USS Halibut (SSGN-587)|SSGN]]), or a [[Minelayer#Naval minelayers|minelaying]] [[USS Argonaut (SS-166)|submarine]]. However, with the exception of the command ship option, all of these proposed configurations required extensive modification of her original design.&lt;ref&gt;Polmar and Moore. ''Cold War Submarines'', p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, ''U.S. Submarines Since 1945'', pp. 96–98.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another potential mission was as an underwater tug, able to rescue disabled submarines under the [[Arctic Ocean|Arctic]] ice pack. ''Triton''{{'}}s first commanding officer, Captain [[Edward L. Beach, Jr.]], requested plans be drawn up for this modification, which he characterized as "easy and inexpensive".  Although there was consideration for a deployment to Arctic waters, there is no evidence that ''Triton'' was ever employed as an underwater tug.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= Box 28: Submerged Towing | url= https://www.eisenhower.archives.gov/research/finding_aids/PDFs/Beach_Edward_Papers.pdf | work= Edward L.

''Triton'' was [[ship naming and launching|launched]] on 19 August 1958, with Louise Willis, the wife of Vice Admiral [[John Wills]] USN (ret.), as her sponsor. The principal address was delivered by Admiral [[Jerauld Wright]], the Commander-in-Chief of the [[United States Joint Forces Command|U.S. Atlantic Command]] (&lt;small&gt;CINCLANT&lt;/small&gt;), the Commander-in-Chief of the [[U.S. Atlantic Fleet#Cold War|U.S. Atlantic Fleet]] (&lt;small&gt;CINCLANTFLT&lt;/small&gt;) and [[Supreme Allied Commander Atlantic]] (&lt;small&gt;SACLANT&lt;/small&gt;) for [[NATO]].&lt;ref&gt;Beach, ''Around the World Submerged'', pp. 6–9.&lt;/ref&gt;  Over 35,000 guests attended, the largest crowd to witness a submarine launching up to that time.&lt;ref&gt;First Submerged Circumnavigation 1960, B-1.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fitting out===
On 1 February 1959, ''Triton'' was provisionally accepted for service in the U.S. Navy, with Captain Beach, the Prospective Commanding Officer (PCO), now designated as Officer-in-Charge.&lt;ref name=First12&gt;First Submerged Circumnavigation 1960, B-1 to B-2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Beach1214&gt;Beach. ''Around the World Submerged'', pp.12–14.&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Triton'' met several key milestones before her commissioning. On 8 February 1959, reactor No. 2 achieved initial criticality, while reactor No 1 achieved this milestone on 3 April 1959.&lt;ref name=First12/&gt;

Two shipboard accidents occurred during ''Triton''{{'}}s post-launch fitting-out. On 2 October 1958, prior to the nuclear reactor fuel being installed, a steam valve failed during testing, causing a large cloud of steam that filled the number two reactor compartment, and on 7 April 1959, a fire broke out during the testing of a deep-fat fryer and spread from the galley into the ventilation lines of the crew's mess. Both incidents, neither nuclear related, were quickly handled by ship personnel, with Lt. Commander Leslie B. Kelly, the prospective chief engineering officer, being awarded the [[Navy and Marine Corps Medal]] for his quick action during the incident on 2 October.&lt;ref name=First12/&gt;&lt;ref name=Beach1214/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=26 October 1959 |title=Officer Of Sub Triton To Get Medal For Heroic Rescue Of Crew Member |newspaper=[[Hartford Courant]] |page=8A |url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/courant/access/914242762.html?dids=914242762:914242762&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:AI&amp;type=historic&amp;date=Oct+26%2C+1959&amp;author=&amp;pub=Hartford+Courant&amp;desc=Officer+Of+Sub+Triton+To+Get+Medal+For+Heroic+Rescue+Of+Crew+Member&amp;pqatl=google |accessdate=2010-07-09 |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sea trials===
''Triton'' began her sea trials on 27 September 1959.  Over the next five days, the ship's systems and equipment were thoroughly tested under the overall direction of [[Hyman G. Rickover]] of the [[Bureau of Ships]]' Naval Reactors branch and Captain A. C. Smith, the Supervisor of Shipbuilding at Electric Boat.&lt;ref&gt;Beach. ''Around the World Submerged'', p.18.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Triton'' generated {{convert|45000|hp}} on sea trials, reaching her design surface speed of {{convert|27|kn|km/h mph}}, and achieved a surface speed well in excess of {{convert|30|kn|km/h mph}}.&lt;ref name=Polmar67/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Largess and Horwitz. "USS Triton: The Ultimate Submersible," pp. 178, 180.&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Triton'' subsequently executed a four-hour, full-power submerged run and a crash-back maneuver.&lt;ref group=Note&gt;Crashback is a maneuver which occurs when a ship or submarine reverses its propeller while traveling forward, slowing or stopping that vessel. This results in unpredictable forces on the ship's hull, rudder, and propeller, resulting in decreased control and maneuverability.  Source: {{cite web | author= Matthew P. Shearer | title=  Simulation and Evaluation of Marine Propeller Crashback Through Computational Fluid Dynamics | url= http://oai.dtic.mil/oai/oai?verb=getRecord&amp;metadataPrefix=html&amp;identifier=ADA473284 | work= Trident Scholar Project report no. 358 | publisher= [[United States Naval Academy]] | date= 4 May 2007 | accessdate=2010-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The only significant problem encountered during her initial sea trials was the overheating of the [[lube oil|lubricating oil system]] for the starboard propellor shaft spring bearing.  At the recommendation of Admiral Rickover, a hose was rigged to spray the bearing housing with a steady stream of [[sea water]] to keep the shaft cool, as well as a special watch set to monitor the temperature of the lube oil.&lt;ref&gt;Beach, Around ''the World Submerged'', pp.23–36.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Triton'' began her preliminary acceptance trials (PAT) on 20 September 1959.  These trials were conducted under the supervision of Rear Admiral Francis Douglas McCorkle of the [[Board of Inspection and Survey|U.S. Navy's Board of Inspection and Survey (INSURV)]].  After three days of at-sea tests, ''Triton'' was passed by the INSURV as being ready to enter service as a U.S. naval vessel.&lt;ref name=First12/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Beach.

===Commissioning===
[[File:USS Triton Commissioning.jpg|thumb|right|''Triton'' is [[ship commissioning|commissioned]] on 10 November 1959|alt=A large number of people are gathered around a platform erected just in front of a submarine.]]

''Triton'' was [[ship commissioning|commissioned]] on 10 November 1959 with Captain Edward L. Beach, Jr. in command. Vice Admiral Bernard L. Austin, the Deputy [[Chief of Naval Operations|CNO]] for Plans and Policy, made the keynote address, noting:

&lt;blockquote&gt;As the largest submarine ever built, her performance will be carefully followed by naval designers and planners the world over. For many years strategists have speculated on the possibilities of tankers, cargo ships and transports that could navigate under water.

''Triton'' was assigned to [[Submarine Squadron 10]], the U.S. Navy's first all-nuclear force, based at State Pier in [[New London, Connecticut]], under the command of [[Commodore (USN)#Present day title usage|Commodore]] Tom Henry.&lt;ref&gt;Beach.

On 20 January 1960, ''Triton'' got underway to conduct an accelerated series of at-sea testing. ''Triton'' returned on 1 February as preparations continued for her forthcoming shakedown cruise, scheduled for departure on 16 February 1960, which involved operating with the [[command ship]] {{USS|Northampton|CLC-1|2}}, [[flagship]] of the [[U.S. Second Fleet]], in northern European waters.&lt;ref&gt;Beach.

[[File:Edward L. Beach, Jr.jpg|thumb|right|Captain Beach traces the route of ''Triton'''s submerged circumnavigation|alt=A balding man holding a small card titled "Ship's Position" writes a black line on a map of the Earth.]]
During her shakedown cruise, ''Triton'' successfully executed the first submerged circumnavigation of the world, [[code name]]d Operation Sandblast, following the same track as the first circumnavigation led by [[Ferdinand Magellan]].  The mission's objectives were set forth in the published [[ship's log]] (''pictured''):

&lt;blockquote&gt;For purposes of geophysical and oceanographic research and to determine habitability, endurance and psychological stress – all extremely important to the [[UGM-27 Polaris|Polaris program]] – it had been decided that a rapid round-the-world trip, touching the areas of interest, should be conducted. Maximum stability of the observing platform and unbroken continuity around the world were important. Additionally, for reasons of the national interest it had been decided that the voyage should be made entirely submerged undetected by our own or other forces and completed as soon as possible. TRITON, because of her size, speed and extra dependability of her two-reactor plant, had been chosen for the mission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= USS Trton SSRN 586 First Submerged Circumnavigation 1960 - O - 550280 |year= 1960 |publisher= [[United States Government Printing Office|U.S. Government Printing Office]]|location= [[Washington, DC]] |isbn=  |pages= B-5 |url=   |accessdate=2015-01-24|quote=Hereafter referred to as ''First Submerged Circumnavigation 1960''}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The actual mission was summarized by the U.S. Navy's ''[[Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships]]'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;''Triton'' put to sea on her shakedown cruise on 15 February 1960, bound for the South Atlantic. She arrived in the middle Atlantic off [[St. Peter and St. Paul Rocks]] on 24 February to commence a history-making voyage. Having remained submerged since her departure from the east coast, Triton continued on south towards Cape Horn, rounded the tip of South America, and headed west across the Pacific. After transiting the [[Philippines|Philippine]] and [[Indonesia]]n archipelagos and crossing the [[Indian Ocean]], she rounded the [[Cape of Good Hope]] and arrived off the St. Peter and Paul Rocks on 10 April—60 days and 21 hours after departing the mid-ocean landmark. Only once did her sail break the surface of the sea, when she transferred a sick sailor to [[USS Macon (CA-132)|''Macon'' (CA-132)]] off [[Montevideo, Uruguay]], on 6 March. She arrived back at Groton, Connecticut, on 10 May, having completed the first submerged circumnavigation of the earth.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;''Triton''{{'}}s globe-girdling cruise proved invaluable to the United States. Politically, it enhanced the nation's prestige. From an operational viewpoint, the cruise demonstrated the great submerged endurance and sustained high-speed transit capabilities of the first generation of nuclear-powered submarines. Moreover, during the voyage, the submarine collected reams of oceanographic data. At the cruise's conclusion, ''Triton'' received the [[Presidential Unit Citation (United States)|Presidential Unit Citation]] and [[Edward L. Beach, Jr.|Captain Beach]] received the [[Legion of Merit]] from [[Dwight D. Eisenhower|President Dwight D. Eisenhower]].&lt;ref name=DANFS&gt;{{cite DANFS | title = Triton | url = https://www.history.navy.mil/research/histories/ship-histories/danfs/t/triton-v.html | short = yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

''Triton''{{'}}s commanding officer during Operation Sandblast, Captain Edward L. Beach, also provided a unique perspective on the circumnavigation in the published log:

{{quote|The sea may yet hold the key to the salvation of man and his civilization. That the world may better understand this, the Navy directed a submerged retrace of Ferdinand Magellan's historic circumnavigation. The honor of doing it fell to ''Triton'', but it has been a national accomplishment; for the sinews and the power which make up our ship, the genius which designed her, the thousands and hundreds of thousands who labored, each at his own metier, in all parts of the country, to build her safe, strong, self-reliant, are America.  ''Triton'', a unit of their Navy, pridefully and respectfully dedicates this voyage to the people of the United States.&lt;ref&gt;''First Submerged Circumnavigation 1960'', B-79.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The noted historian [[Bern Dibner]] placed the significance of Operation Sandblast into historical context:

{{quote|The epochal achievement of the fleet of Magellan in circumnavigating the globe was echoed in the magnificent accomplishment by the nuclear submarine ''Triton'' in 1960.  Like the voyage of Magellan, that of ''Triton'' created stirring philosophical concepts.  It demonstrated that a company of men could live and work in the depth of the ocean for months at a time.  It was shown that through the new technology a source of power had been made in such abundance and so manageable that, without refueling, an 8000-ton vehicle would be driven through the water around the world.  It was also shown that the arts of observation, navigation, communication and control had reached the point where travel under the water was possible with pinpoint accuracy.&lt;ref&gt;Dibner. ''Victoria and Triton''. p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Also, in his 2000 book ''Ships Of Discovery And Exploration'', historian Lincoln P. Paine further noted:

{{quote|Although the voyage had been conceived as a way for [[Dwight D. Eisenhower|Eisenhower]] to impress [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Soviet General Secretary]] [[Nikita Khrushchev]] at the Paris summit, this conference was canceled after U-2 pilot [[Francis Gary Powers]] was [[1960 U-2 incident|shot down]] over the [[Soviet Union]] on May 1. But coming less than two years after the transpolar expedition of {{USS|Nautilus|SSN-571|6}}, ''Triton''{{'}}s accomplishment was a clear reaffirmation of U.S. technological supremacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Ships Of Discovery And Exploration |last= Paine |first= Lincoln P. |year= 2000 |publisher= [[Houghton Mifflin Harcourt]] |location= [[Boston, Massachusetts]] |isbn= 978-0-39598-415-4 |pages= 142–143 |url= http://www.hmhco.com/shop/books/Ships-of-Discovery-and-Exploration/9780395984154 |accessdate=2014-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The actual submerged circumnavigation occurred between 24 February and 25 April 1960, covering {{convert|26723|nmi|km mi}} in 60 days and 21 hours at the average speed of {{convert|18|kn|km/h mph}} while crossing the [[Equator]] on four different occasions.&lt;ref name=Beachappendix&gt;Beach, ''Around the World Submerged'', data sheet appendix.&lt;/ref&gt;  Also, the total duration of ''Triton''{{'}}s shakedown cruise was 84 days 19 hours 8&amp;nbsp;minutes, covering {{convert|36335.1|nmi|km mi}}, and ''Triton'' remained submerged for a total of 83 days 9 hours, covering {{convert|35979.1|nmi|km mi}} during her maiden voyage.&lt;ref name=Beachappendix/&gt;

The ''[[New York Times]]'' described ''Triton''{{'}}s submerged circumnavigation of the world as "a triumph of human prowess and engineering skill, a feat which the United States Navy can rank as one of its bright victories in man's ultimate conquest of the seas."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= The Modern Magellans | url= http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F40617FC345C16738DDDAA0994DD405B808AF1D3 | work= | publisher= New York Times | date= 13 May 1960 | accessdate=2010-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following her post-shakedown availability (PSA), ''Triton'' assumed her duties as a radar picket submarine in August 1960. She deployed to northern European waters with the Second Fleet to participate in NATO exercises oriented around detecting and intercepting Soviet bombers overflying the Arctic.&lt;ref name=DANFS/&gt; ''Triton'' also participated in NATO exercises against British naval forces led by the aircraft carriers {{HMS|Ark Royal|R09|2}} and {{HMS|Hermes|R12|2}} under the command of Rear Admiral [[Sir Charles Madden, 2nd Baronet|Sir Charles Madden]], RN.&lt;ref&gt;Beach. ''Salt and Steel'', pp. 263–268.&lt;/ref&gt;  For two days during these NATO exercises, Rear Admiral [[Thomas H. Moorer]] and his [[flag lieutenant]], Lt. [[William P.

For the first half of 1961, ''Triton'' conducted operational patrols and training exercises with the Atlantic Fleet.&lt;ref name=DANFS/&gt;  This included an at-sea exercise involving low-power testing in support of the development of a proposed natural circulation [[S5G reactor|reactor (NCR)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author= Henry Stone | title= Walter H.

During this period, the rising threat posed by Soviet submarine forces increased the Navy's demands for nuclear-powered attack submarines with antisubmarine warfare (ASW) capability. Following the development of the carrier-based [[Grumman]] [[E-1 Tracer|WF-2 Tracer]] [[airborne early warning]] aircraft, ''Triton''{{'}}s AN/SPS-26 3-D long-range air search radar was no longer needed, and the development of the submarine version of this 3-D radar system, the BPS-10, was canceled in 1960.&lt;ref name=Friedman9596253n11/&gt;  Accordingly, upon the demise of the Navy's radar picket submarine program, ''Triton'' was redesignated SSN-586 on 1 March 1961.&lt;ref name=DANFS/&gt;

===Overhaul and conversion===
''Triton'' entered the [[Portsmouth Naval Shipyard]] in June 1962 for conversion to an attack submarine. Her crew complement was reduced from 172 to 159. She was overhauled and refueled at Groton, Connecticut, from September 1962 to January 1964, which included modification to serve as the flagship for &lt;small&gt;COMSUBLANT&lt;/small&gt;.&lt;ref name=DANFS/&gt;  Since the Navy no longer had any plans to use ''Triton''{{'}}s radar picket capability, her SPS-26 radar set was replaced by a two-dimensional AN/BPS-2 air search radar, with ''Triton'' now providing the fleet with an at-sea air strike control capability.&lt;ref&gt;Largess and Horwitz. "USS Triton: The Ultimate Submersible," p. 183.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Friedman. U.S. Submarines since 1945, p. 253n13.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:USS Northampton (CC-1) in the North Atlantic 1960.jpg|thumb|right|{{ship|USS|Northampton|CLC-1|6}}]]
Because she subsequently served as &lt;small&gt;COMSUBLANT&lt;/small&gt;'s flagship following her overhaul, one area of continuing speculation is whether ''Triton'' was part of the [[National Emergency Command Post Afloat]] (NECPA) program. NECPA was tasked to provide afloat facilities for the President of the United States in case of an [[Continuity of government#Continuity of government in the United States|emergency or war]], with the command cruisers {{USS|Northampton|CLC-1|2}} (''pictured'') and {{USS|Wright|CVL-49|2}} assigned to perform this mission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= U.S. Cruisers: An Illustrated Design History |last= Freidman |first= Norman |year= 1984 |publisher= Naval Institute Press|location=Annapolis|isbn= 978-0-87021-718-0|pages= 437–445}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author= Karl C.

''Triton'' had a number of attributes that made her a potential NECPA platform. Her size allowed ample room for additional shipboard systems and personnel accommodations. Her designed speed provided the capability for rapid transit, and her nuclear power plant offered virtually unlimited endurance and range. The Combat Information Center (CIC) provided substantial [[command and control (military)|command and control]] capabilities as did the communication buoy system that could receive and send radio transmissions while submerged. As she was a submarine, ''Triton'' offered superior protection against [[Weapon of mass destruction|nuclear-biological-chemical (NBC) contaminants]] over surface ships or an [[Operation Looking Glass|airborne command centre]]. However, the record remains unclear if such an explicit NECPA conversion was ever undertaken for ''Triton''.&lt;ref&gt;Polmar and Moore.

In March 1964, upon completion of her overhaul, ''Triton''{{'}}s home port was changed from New London, to Norfolk. On 13 April 1964, she became the flagship for &lt;small&gt;COMSUBLANT&lt;/small&gt;.&lt;ref name=DANFS/&gt;  On 20 January 1965, ''Triton'' rescued the pilot and a passenger of a charter aircraft that had ditched in the Atlantic Ocean off [[St. Croix]] in the [[Virgin Islands]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= Nuclear Submarine Triton Rescues 2 Men in Atlantic | url= https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1310&amp;dat=19650121&amp;id=3q0QAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=-eIDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6030,3686515 | work= | publisher= [[The Register-Guard|''Eugene Register-Guard'']] | date= 21 January 1965 | accessdate=2010-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Largess and Horwitz.

====Presidential Unit Citation====
On 10 May 1960, [[Secretary of the Navy]] [[William B. Franke]] presented the [[Presidential Unit Citation (United States)|Presidential Unit Citation]] (PUC) to ''Triton'' for [[Operation Sandblast]], the first submerged circumnavigation of the world.  Chief Torpedoman's Mate Chester Raymond Fitzjarrald, the [[Chief of the Boat|chief of the boat]], accepted the PUC on behalf of ''Triton''{{'}}s officers and crew.&lt;ref&gt;Beach. ''Around the World Submerged'', pp. vii, 10, 284.&lt;/ref&gt;  The citation reads:

&lt;blockquote&gt;For meritorious achievement from 16 February 1960 to 10 May 1960.  During this period the TRITON circumnavigated the earth submerged, generally following the route of Magellan's historic voyage. In addition to proving the ability of both crew and nuclear submarine to accomplish a mission which required almost three months of submergence, TRITON collected much data of scientific importance. The performance, determination and devotion to duty of the TRITON's crew were in keeping with the highest traditions of the naval service.  All members of the crew who made this voyage are authorized to wear the Presidential Unit Citation ribbon with a special clasp in the form of a golden replica of the globe.&lt;ref name=TheDay05111960&gt;{{cite news |first= Jim |last=Cunningham |author= |title=2,000 Welcome Sub Triton On return Voyage |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=D580AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=7nEFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1314,1269026&amp;dq=submarine+triton&amp;hl=en |newspaper=[[The Day (New London)|The Day]] |location=New London |page= 2 |doi= |date=May 11, 1960}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The citation reads:

&lt;blockquote&gt;For exceptionally meritorious service during a period in 1967. USS ''Triton'' conducted important and arduous independent submarine operations of great importance to the national defense of the United States. The outstanding results achieved during the highly successful operations attest to the exceptional professional skill, resourcefulness and ingenuity of ''Triton''{{'}}s officers and men. Their inspiring performance of duty throughout was in keeping with the highest traditions of the naval service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first= Jim |last=Cunningham |author= |title= Nuclear subs given secret Navy citations |url= https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/20207593/ |work= The [[Arizona Republic]] |publisher= [[Gannett Company]] |location=[[Phoenix, Arizona]] |page= 32 |doi= |date= October 16, 1968 |accessdate=2014-01-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Decommissioning and final disposition==
[[File:TritonDisposal.jpg|thumb|right|''Triton'' in dry dock at the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard, November 2007|alt=A dilapidated submarine is out of the water. A crane sits above the hulk.]]
Due to cutbacks in defense spending, as well as the expense of operating her twin nuclear reactors, ''Triton'''s scheduled 1967 overhaul was canceled, and the submarine—along with 60 other vessels—was slated for inactivation.&lt;ref name=DANFS/&gt;  While ''Triton''{{'}}s twin reactor plant was designed to be refueled by a [[submarine tender]] like other U.S. nuclear submarines, because of the complexity of her [[zirconium|zirconium-clad]] fuel elements, ''Triton''{{'}}s previous re-fueling had been done in a shipyard during her 1962–1964 overhaul.  Although new fuel elements were procured and available for installation, ''Triton''{{'}}s overhaul was canceled,  a source of controversy.  One speculation suggests that the cancellation of ''Triton''{{'}}s overhaul allowed funds to be redirected for the repairs to the [[supercarrier]] {{USS|Forrestal|CV-59|2}} which had been [[1967 USS Forrestal fire|extensively damaged]] off [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]].&lt;ref name=Largess187&gt;Largess and Horwitz. "USS Triton: The Ultimate Submersible," p. 187.&lt;/ref&gt;
From October 1968 through May 1969, she underwent preservation and deactivation processes, and she was decommissioned on 3 May 1969.&lt;ref name=DANFS/&gt;  ''Triton'' became the U.S. Navy's first nuclear-powered submarine to be taken out of service, and second in the world, after the [[Soviet Navy|Soviet Navy's]] [[November class submarine|November-class]] submarine [[Soviet submarine K-27|''K-27'']] in 1968.&lt;ref&gt;Polmar and Moore. ''Cold War Submarines'', pp. 68, 81.&lt;/ref&gt;  On 6 May 1969, ''Triton'' departed New London under tow and proceeded to Norfolk, Virginia, where she was placed in the reserve fleet. She remained berthed at Norfolk or at the [[St. Julien's Creek Annex]] of [[Norfolk Naval Shipyard]] in [[Portsmouth, Virginia]], into 1993. She was stricken from the [[Naval Vessel Registry]] on 30 April 1986.&lt;ref name=DANFS/&gt;  In August 1993, the hulks of the ex-''Triton'' and the ex-''Ray'' were towed by the [[Rescue and salvage ship|salvage tug]] [[USS Bolster (ARS-38)|''Bolster'']] to the [[Puget Sound Naval Shipyard|Puget Sound Naval Shipyard (PSNS)]], in [[Bremerton, Washington]], arriving on 3 September 1993, to await their turn in the [[Ship-Submarine recycling program|Nuclear Powered Ship and Submarine Recycling Program (SRP)]].&lt;ref name=DANFS/&gt;

Effective 1 October 2007, ex-''Triton'' landed on the keel resting blocks in the [[Puget Sound Naval Shipyard#Ship-Submarine Recycling Program|drydock basin]] to begin recycling (''pictured'').&lt;ref name=DANFS/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Morison |first=Samuel Loring |authorlink= Samuel Loring Morison |date=May 2008 |title=U.S. Naval Battle Force Changes 1 January 2007 – 31 December 2007 |journal=United States Naval Institute Proceedings |volume=134 |issue=5 |page=102 |id=0041-798X }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The long delay in the disposal of ex-''Triton'' has been attributed to the complexity of her dual reactor plant.&lt;ref name=Largess187/&gt;  Final recycling was completed effective 30 November 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Morison |first=Samuel Loring |authorlink= Samuel Loring Morison |date=May 2010 |title=U.S. Naval Battle Force Changes 1 January 2009 – 31 December 2009 |journal=United States Naval Institute Proceedings |volume=135 |issue=5 |page=112 |id=0041-798X }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Triton plaque===
[[File:Magellan-Triton.jpg|thumb|right|The Triton Plaque|alt=A round metal object features a sailing ship in the center. In a circle around the edges are the Latin words "Ave Nobilis Dux, Iterum Factum Est".]]

In the eight days prior to ''Triton''{{'}}s departure on her around-the-world submerged voyage, Captain Beach approached Lt. Tom B. Thamm, ''Triton''{{'}}s Auxiliary Division Officer, to design a commemorative plaque for their upcoming voyage, as well as the first circumnavigation led by Portuguese explorer [[Ferdinand Magellan]].&lt;ref name=Beach5556&gt;Beach. ''Around the World Submerged'', pp. 55–56, 290.&lt;/ref&gt; The plaque's eventual design consisted of a [[brass]] disk about {{convert|23|in|cm}} in diameter, bearing a sailing ship reminiscent of Magellan's carrack, ''Trinidad'', above the [[Submarine Warfare insignia|submarine dolphin insignia]] with the years 1519 and 1960 between them, all within a [[laurel wreath]]. Outside the wreath is the motto ''AVE NOBILIS DUX, ITERUM FACTUM EST'' ("Hail Noble Captain, It Is Done Again").&lt;ref name=Beach5556/&gt;

Commodore Tom Henry, commanding Submarine Squadron 10, supervised the completion of the plaque. The carving of the wooden form was done by retired Chief Electrician's Mate Ernest L. Benson at New London. The actual molding of the plaque was done by the Mystic Foundry.&lt;ref name=Beach5556/&gt;

During the homeward leg of her around-the-world voyage, ''Triton'' rendezvoused with the destroyer {{USS|John W. Weeks|DD-701|2}} on 2 May 1960 off [[Cadiz]], Spain, the departure point for Magellan's earlier voyage. ''Triton'' broached, and ''John W. Weeks'' transferred the finished plaque to ''Triton'' for transport back to the United States. The plaque was subsequently presented to the Spanish government by [[John Davis Lodge]], the United States Ambassador to Spain. This plaque is located at the City Hall in [[Sanlúcar de Barrameda]], Spain, and it is mounted on the wall of the city hall with a marble slab memorializing the 1960 ''Triton'' submerged circumnavigation.&lt;ref name=Beach263&gt;Beach. ''Around the World Submerged'', p. pp. 263–267, 290.&lt;/ref&gt;

Duplicates of the Triton Plaque were also presented to the [[Mystic Seaport Museum]] in [[Mystic, Connecticut]], and the [[Naval Historical Association]] in Washington, D.C., as well as the [[U.S. Navy Submarine School]] and the U.S. Navy [[Submarine Force Library and Museum]], both located in Groton, Connecticut.&lt;ref name=Beach263/&gt;

Triton Light is a [[lighthouse|navigational beacon]] on the seawall of the [[United States Naval Academy]] in Annapolis, Maryland, where the [[Severn River (Maryland)|Severn River]] meets Spa Creek and the Annapolis harbor. It was donated to the Academy and named for the Greek god by the United States Naval Academy Class of 1945. The crew of ''Triton'' provided samples of water taken from the 22 seas through which their ship had passed during their submerged 1960 circumnavigation. These samples filled a globe built into the Triton Light, and the naming of the light and significance of the globe are explained in a commemorative marker.&lt;ref&gt;Beach.

USS ''Triton'' Recruit Barracks (Ship 12) was dedicated in ceremonies at the U.S. Navy's Recruit Training Command, [[Naval Station Great Lakes]], near North Chicago, Illinois, on 25 June 2004. The facility honors the memory of two submarines named ''Triton'' and includes memorabilia from both. Triton Hall is the fifth barracks constructed under the RTC Recapitalization Project, covering 172,000 square feet (15,979 square meters) in floor space.

The USS ''Triton'' Submarine Memorial Park is located on the [[Columbia River]], at the end of Port of Benton Boulevard in north [[Richland, Washington]]. Its purpose is "to establish a permanent park in north Richland in recognition of all the decommissioned reactor cores off-loaded at the Port's barge slip, transported and stored at the [[Hanford Site]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Triton Sail |url=http://www.prosser.org/media/Port%20of%20Benton%2009Fall.pdf |format=PDF |work=The re: Port of Benton |publisher=Port of Benton |date=Fall 2009 |accessdate=2010-02-11 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5niucuKXZ?url=http://www.prosser.org/media/Port%20of%20Benton%2009Fall.pdf |archivedate=22 February 2010 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The park features ''Triton''{{'}}s [[sail (submarine)|sail superstructure]] (''pictured'') and an information display on the history of ''Triton''. The park also serves as a tourist attraction, especially due to its location, since Hanford is the resting place of spent reactor cores from several Navy ships.

''Triton'' is referenced briefly in three popular [[Cold War]] novels. In ''The Last Mayday'' by Keith Wheeler (1968), ''Triton'' is depicted as participating in a submarine training exercise at the beginning of the novel, with special notice made of her large, rectangular sail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= The Last Mayday |last= Wheeler |first= Keith |year= 1968 |publisher=[[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday]]|location=New York |isbn= |pages= 134–137}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the 1978 novel ''Cold is the Sea'' by Edward L.

''Cold War Submarines'', p 354–355.&lt;/ref&gt;  Finally, in ''[[The Hunt for Red October]]'' by [[Tom Clancy]], the biographical background for Marko Ramius mentions that, while commanding a [[Charlie class submarine|''Charlie''-class submarine]], Ramius had "hounded [''Triton''] mercilessly for twelve hours" in the [[Norwegian Sea]]. Subsequently, Ramius "would note with no small satisfaction that the ''Triton'' was soon thereafter retired, because, it was said, the oversized vessel had proven unable to deal with the newer Soviet designs."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= The Hunt for Red October |last= Clancy |first= Tom |authorlink= Tom Clancy |year= 1984 |publisher=Naval Institute Press|location=Annapolis|isbn= 978-0-425-12027-9 |pages= 134–137}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the 50th anniversary of Operation Sandblast, writer-historian Carl LaVO wrote "Incredible Voyage" for the June 2010 edition of ''Naval History'' magazine, and John Beach wrote "The First Submerged Circumnavigation" for the April 1960 issue of ''The Submarine Review'', the official magazine of the Naval Submarine League.&lt;ref name=LaVO&gt;{{cite journal |author= Carl LaVO |date= June 2010  |title=  Incredible Voyage |journal= Naval History |publisher= United States Naval Institute |volume= 24 |issue= 3 |pages= 50–57 |url= https://www.usni.org/members/login.asp?redir=/magazines/navalhistory/story.asp?STORY_ID=2340 |issn= 1042-1920}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=JohnBeach&gt;{{cite journal |author= John Beach |date= April 1960 |title= USS TRITON (SSRN-586): The First Submerged Circumnavigation |journal= The Submarine Review |publisher= Naval Submarine League |pages= 23–35 |url= http://www.navalsubleague.com/NSL/subreview.aspx |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100722022750/http://www.navalsubleague.com/NSL/subreview.aspx |archivedate= 22 July 2010 |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Mr. Beach is the nephew of Captain Edward L. Beach, the commanding officer of the USS ''Triton'' during Operation Sandblast.&lt;ref&gt;Finch. ''Beneath the Waves'', p. 207.&lt;/ref&gt;  Finally, the [[United States Naval Institute|Naval Institute Press]] published ''Beneath the Waves'' by Dr. Edward F. Finch, a 2010 biography of the late Captain Beach, which includes extensive coverage of Operation Sandblast.&lt;ref name=Finch&gt;{{cite book |title= Beneath the Waves: The Life and Navy of Capt.

The legacy of Operation Sandblast on its 50th anniversary was summarized by retired Captain James C. Hay who had served on ''Triton'' during its historic submerged around-the-world voyage.  On the editorial page of the April 1960 issue of ''The Submarine Review'', the official magazine of the Naval Submarine League, Captain Hay noted:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It is truly a cruise which tested the crew's mettle and proved the [[Edward L. Beach, Jr.|skipper's]] ''tenacity''.  More than that, however, it again proved to all who cared to listen that the US Navy could go anywhere, at any time, and do what ever was required.  It's a good [[Nautical fiction|sea story]] about doing what had to be done.  On the fiftieth anniversary of the First Submerged Circumnavigation it's a good thing to do to re-read about one of the forerunners of all we're done since.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= James C.

In [[Christianity]] the term "'''water of Life'''" ({{lang-el|ὕδωρ ζωῆς}} ''hydōr zōēs'') is used in the context of ''living water'', specific references appearing in the [[Book of Revelation]] ([[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Revelation#21:6|21:6]] and [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Revelation#22:1|22:1]]), as well as the [[Gospel of John]].&lt;ref name=DLJ457 &gt;David L. Jeffrey (1992) ''A Dictionary of biblical tradition in English literature'' {{ISBN|0-8028-3634-8}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=7R0IGTSvIVIC&amp;pg=PA458 pp. 457–458]&lt;/ref&gt; In these references, the term ''Water of Life'' refers to the [[Holy Spirit (Christianity)|Holy Spirit]].&lt;ref name=DLJ457 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Aquinas /&gt;&lt;ref name=Augustine /&gt;

The passages that comprise [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/John#4:10|John 4:10–26]] are sometimes referred to as the '''Water of Life Discourse'''.&lt;ref name=CKBarrett /&gt; These references in the [[Gospel of John]] are also interpreted as the ''Water of Life''.&lt;ref name=Augustine /&gt;

The term is also used when water is poured during [[Baptism|Baptismal prayers]], praying for the Holy Spirit, e.g., "Give it the power to become water of life".&lt;ref&gt;''Baptism in the Early Church: History, Theology, and Liturgy in the First Five Centuries'' by Everett Ferguson 2009 {{ISBN|0-8028-2748-9}} p. 730&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Maxwell E. Johnson (2007) ''The rites of Christian initiation: their evolution and interpretation'' {{ISBN|0-8146-6215-3}} p. 288&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Book of Revelation==

The reference to Water of Life in [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Revelation#21:6|Revelation 21:6]] appears in the context of [[New Jerusalem]] and states:

:"I will give unto him that is athirst of the fountain of the water of life freely". Revelation 22:1 then states: "And he showed me a river of water of life, bright as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb" .

The Revelation reference is interpreted as the [[Holy Spirit (Christianity)|Holy Spirit]].&lt;ref name=Aquinas &gt;Thomas Aquinas, Daniel Keating, Matthew Levering (2010) ''Commentary on the Gospel of John, Chapters 1–5, Books 1–5'' {{ISBN|0-8132-1723-7}} p. 91&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Catechism of the Catholic Church]], item 1137, considers it "one of most beautiful symbols of the Holy Spirit".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p2s1c2a1.htm Vatican website: ''Catechism'' item 1137]&lt;/ref&gt;

The common theme of thirst for the Water of Life in the Book of Revelation and the Gospel of John may be summarized as follows:
&lt;ref&gt;Paul Barnett (2002) ''Jesus &amp; the Rise of Early Christianity'' {{ISBN|0-8308-2699-8}} p. 312&lt;/ref&gt;

{| style=border-collapse:collapse border=1 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=5
|- align=center bgcolor=#efefef
![[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Revelation#21:6|Revelation 21:6]]
![[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/John#7:37|John 7:37]]

||... if any man thirsts, let him come unto me and drink.

|}

The use of the term ''Water of Life'' in Revelation 20 is part of the "theme of life" in the book of Revelation, other instances being the ''Book of Life'' in Revelation [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Revelation#21:27|21:27]], and the ''Tree of Life'' in [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Revelation#22:2|22:2]], [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Revelation#22:14|22:14]] and [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Revelation#22:19|22:19]].&lt;ref name=Stott53 /&gt; [[John R. W. Stott]] relates this theme to [[Eternal life (Christianity)|Eternal Life]] in [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/John#17:3|John 17:3]]:  "And this is life eternal, that they should know thee the only true God, and him whom thou didst send, Jesus Christ".&lt;ref name=Stott53 &gt;John R. W. Stott, Sandy Larsen, Dale Larsen (2008) ''Revelation: The Triumph of Christ'' {{ISBN|0-8308-2023-X}} p. 53&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Gospel of John==
[[File:Veronese.Jesus and the Samaritan Woman01.jpg|thumb|270px|Jesus with the ''[[Samaritan woman at the well]]'', by [[Paolo Veronese]], 1585]]
In the [[Gospel of John]] some references to water, as in John 4:15, are traditionally identified as the ''Water of Life'' being the Holy Spirit.&lt;ref name=Augustine &gt;Saint Augustine and Edmund Hill (2009) ''Homilies on the Gospel of John 1–40 (Works of Saint Augustine: A Translation for the 21st Century)'' {{ISBN|1-56548-318-9}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=DAn6876NIZYC&amp;pg=PA284 p. 284 ]&lt;/ref&gt;

The passages that comprise [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/John#4:10|John 4:10–26]], and relate the episode of the [[Samaritan woman at the well|Samaritan woman]] are sometimes referred to as the "Water of Life Discourse".&lt;ref name=CKBarrett /&gt; The Water of Life Discourse is the second among the seven discourses in the Gospel of John that pair with the seven signs in that gospel.&lt;ref&gt;Ben Witherington III (2009) ''The Indelible Image: The Theological and Ethical World of the New Testament, Vol. 1'' {{ISBN|0-8308-3861-9}} p. 559&lt;/ref&gt;

Another discourse, called the [[Bread of Life Discourse]] appears in [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/John#6:22|John 6:22–59]].&lt;ref&gt;Thomas L.

G. Dunn (1985) ''The evidence for Jesus'' {{ISBN|0-664-24698-2}} p. 39&lt;/ref&gt; However, these two discourses in the Gospel of John complement each other to form the theme of "Christ as the Life".&lt;ref name=CKBarrett &gt;C. K. Barrett (1955) ''The Gospel According to St. John: An Introduction With Commentary and Notes'' {{ISBN|0-664-22180-7}} p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Vine124 &gt;[[W. E. Vine]] (2010) ''Christ (Vine's Topical Commentaries)'' {{ISBN|1-4185-4309-8}} p. 124&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[W. E. Vine]], this theme of "Christ as the Life" relates to
[[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/John#5:26|John 5:26]] where Jesus states: "Just as the Father has life in himself, so also he gave to his Son the possession of life in himself", reflecting the assertion of Jesus to have the power to give life, based on his relationship to the [[God the Father|Eternal Father]].&lt;ref name=Vine124 /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2828">'''Xylotechnigraphy''' is an [[Architecture|architectural]] term for a decorative treatment to [[wood]]. By [[Wood stain|staining]], [[Wood finishing|finishing]], and [[Wood grain|graining]], the wood resembles a more expensive or finer type. The process was invented by A. F. Brophy and [[patent]]ed in [[England]] in 1871.&lt;ref name=architect&gt;''The Architect'' (6 March 1875). [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=2p8cAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA144 "Royal Institute of British Architects: Paper read by Mr. G. T. Robinson, Contributing Visitor, on Certain New or Recently-revived Processes in Decorative Art."], p. 144&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Curl | first = James Stevens| title = A Dictionary of Architecture and Landscape Architecture | year = 2006 | type = Paperback | edition = Second | publisher = Oxford University Press | isbn = 0-19-860678-8 | page = 880 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a paper read before a meeting of the Royal Institute of British Architects three years after xylotechnigraphy was patented, [[G. T. Robinson]] described it as "in principle exceedingly simple. ... To ceilings, doors, [[Dado (architecture)|dados]] in our private houses, to partitions and fittings of our banks and commercial offices, this process is, I conceive, exceedingly applicable, and to our larger and less movable pieces of furniture it is not misapplied, though I confess to a lurking dislike to it in those lesser articles to which true [[inlay]], by reason of their smaller process, seems more aesthetically appropriate."&lt;ref name=architect&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In the same paper, Robinson quoted the patent in which Brophy detailed the process:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In order to [[Wood stain|stain]] wood in various colours, according to any suitable design, leaving, if desired, parts of the wood unstained, so as to obtain an imitation of inlay, I proceed as follows: I first apply a [[varnish]] or solution which will fill the pores of the wood, and exclude the staining liquid from such parts of the surface as are to remain unstained, then when the varnish or solution is dry, I apply over the whole surface the lightest stain I intend to use; this stain being dry I again apply the varnish, or stopping, coating with it such parts of the surface as I desire to retain of a colour corresponding to the lightest stain, and so I proceed until the desired effect is obtained, the last stain applied being usually black or a very dark stain. The surface having been cleared off may, if desired, be varnished or polished all over, or it may remain as it is left by the last staining process.&lt;ref name=architect&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==History==
Zev began as a garage project for Darus Zehrbach Jr., in his home garage in 2006. He saw the potential for a global market, while traveling the world as a mechanical engineer. In 2009 operations moved to an airport hangar in Waynesburg, PA before moving back to Morgantown, WV in 2013 where the company is currently located. Zehrbach's son, Darus Zehrbach III, joined the family business at age 24 after earning an MBA from West Virginia University.&lt;ref name = "Dominion Post"&gt;{{cite news |author= |coauthors= |title=It's Electric: ZEV Ships gas-free scooters, motorcycles around the world|url=http://thedpost.com/AREA-BUSINESSES/ZEV-ELECTRIC|quote= |work=[[The Dominion Post (Morgantown)|The Dominion Post]] |date=August 30, 2015 |accessdate=2016-08-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scooters and motorcycles==
[[File:Z Electric Vehicle Trail 6100 Green Camo.JPG|thumb|left|ZEV T series]]
ZEV has 19 electric scooter models&lt;ref name = "Cleanrider"&gt;{{cite news |author=JP |coauthors= |title=ZEV: from scooters to motorcycles |url=http://cleanrider.com/zev-from-scooters-to-motorcycles/|quote= |work= CleanRider.com |date=September 3, 2015 |accessdate=2016-08-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The scooters range from the ZEV 3600 with a top speed of {{convert|60|km/h}} and a range of {{convert|32|mi}}, to the {{Convert|10|kW|abbr=on}} [[ZEV 10 LRC|10 LRC]],  with a range (at 65% power) of {{convert|140|mi}}, and a top speed of {{convert|130|km/h}}.&lt;ref name = "Dealernews"/&gt;

ZEV also makes a line of electric motorcycles, full fairing sports bikes referred to as their M-S line.&lt;ref name = "Cleanrider"/&gt;

ZEV claims that its motors are among the world's most efficient in that they have more range than other competing bikes with up to 30% more battery capacity.  ZEV competed in the 2016 Vetter Challenge, an Ohio efficiency rally—though ZEV's scooters were disqualified for failing to finish.&lt;ref&gt;The [http://www.schultzengineering.us/events/v-chall-16/v-chall-16.htm Vetter Challenge] is a set course fuel economy contest, which in 2016 pitted electric versus gas powered motorcyles and scooters.&lt;/ref&gt;

"What we try to do is offer higher speeds and performance than the competition, generally at 25 percent less price. We're the only company that uses hub motors, built in the back wheel. There's no chain, there's no belt drive and no air being forced through the motor, so you'll find our bikes are significantly quieter than anybody else's electric bike," said Zehrbach.&lt;ref name ="Powersports"/&gt;

==Markets==
In addition to sales in the US, as of 2013 ZEV was exporting scooters to 24 countries worldwide, and has won awards for exports and marketing. With 19 models of scooter, and a motorcycle, ZEV is reported to have the widest range of models of any electric motorcycle and scooter manufacturing company in the world.&lt;ref name = "Dominion Post"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Powersports #2"&gt;{{cite news |author= |coauthors= |title=ZEV electric bikes win 14 export awards

==Convictions of ZEV’s Darus Zehrbach, ==
In 1994 a Third Circuit federal appellate court upheld the conviction of Darus Zehrbach,  and an associate on charges of bankruptcy fraud.&lt;ref name= "3rd Circuit"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2.ca3.uscourts.gov/opinarch/94a0946p.txt |title=United states v. Darus H. Zehrbach &amp; Alex A. Mervis | newspaper =Third Circuit Court of Appeals (unpublished opinion) |date=January 23, 1995  |author=Roth, Circuit Judge |accessdate= August 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mr. Zehrbach was accused of rigging an auction of the assets of a bankrupt aircraft manufacturing company, by paying off others to refrain from bidding.  Mr. Zehrbach was sentenced to imprisonment for 21 months, followed by three years of supervised release.&lt;ref name= "3rd Circuit"/&gt;

In 2004 a Fourth Circuit federal appellate court confirmed another conviction of Mr. Zehrbach and an associate of conspiracy to defraud buyers of aircraft kit engines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= |coauthors= |title=Two Businessmen Sentenced for Fraud |url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-9876121.html |quote= |work=[[Charleston Daily Mail]] |date=October 19, 2002 |accessdate=2016-08-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MyUser_Ca4.uscourts.gov_August_30_2015c"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ca4.uscourts.gov/opinions/Unpublished/024863.U.pdf |title=United States of America vs. Darus Zehrbach &amp; Lee Ann Demus  |date=May 11, 2004  |newspaper=Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals (unpublished opinion) |author=per curiam |accessdate= August 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Zehrbach was found to have promised to deliver aircraft engine kits that did not yet exist.  While negotiating the deals Mr. Zehrbach was out on bond during the appeal of the previous bankruptcy fraud conviction.  He did not tell prospective buyers that he and a co-conspirator had previous convictions for crimes involving financial dishonesty, nor that he would be incarcerated during the period he had promised delivery. The court concluded the engines did not exist, he had no intention of delivering them, and simply took the buyers’ money and never repaid it.  The court affirmed his sentence of 54 months imprisonment, and required restitution of $224,148.10.&lt;ref name="MyUser_Ca4.uscourts.gov_August_30_2015c"/&gt;
