'''Abdul''' (also [[Romanization of Arabic|transliterated]] as '''Abdal''', '''Abdel''', '''Abdil''', '''Abdol''', '''Abdool''', or '''Abdoul'''; {{lang-ar|عبد ال}}, {{transl|ar|DIN|''ʿAbd al-''}}) is the most frequent transliteration of the combination of the Arabic word ''[[Abd (Arabic)|Abd]]'' ({{lang|ar|عبد}}, &lt;small&gt;meaning&lt;/small&gt; "Servant") and the definite prefix ''[[Al-|al]] / el'' ({{lang|ar|ال}}, &lt;small&gt;meaning&lt;/small&gt; "the").&lt;ref name="Hanks 2003"&gt;{{cite book |last=Hanks |first=P. |title=Dictionary of American Family Names: 3-Volume Set |publisher=Oxford University Press, USA |issue=v. 3 |year=2003 |isbn=978-0-19-508137-4 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vG7MZ9J6dAgC&amp;pg=PA3 |access-date=2 September 2018 |page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is the initial component of many [[compound (linguistics)|compound]] names, names made of two words. For example, {{lang|ar|عبد الحميد}}, ''{{transl|ar|ʿAbd el-Ḥamīd}}'', usually spelled ''Abdel Hamid'', ''Abdelhamid'', ''Abd El Hamid'' or ''Abdul Hamid'', which means "servant of The Praised" (God).

The most common use for ''Abdul'' by far, is as part of a male [[#Theophoric naming|given name]], written in English. When written in [[English language|English]], ''Abdul'' is subject to variable spacing, spelling, and hyphenation.

The meaning of ''Abdul'' literally and normally means "Slave of", but English translations also often translate it to: "Servant&lt;ref name=ahmed&gt;{{cite book| title=A Dictionary of Muslim Names| author=Salahuddin Ahmed| publisher = Hurst &amp; Company| location=London| year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=rahman&gt;{{cite book| title=A Dictionary of Muslim Names| author= S. A. Rahman| publisher=Goodword Books| location=New Delhi| year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the".

== Spelling variations ==
Variations in spelling are primarily because of the variation in pronunciation. Arabic speakers normally pronounce and transcribe their names of Arabic origin according to their [[varieties of Arabic|spoken Arabic dialects]]. Therefore, it is pronounced {{IPA|/&lt;!--unstressed--&gt;ʕabdel/}} and written ''Abdel...'' or ''Abd El...''. However, non-Arabic speakers or Arabic speakers may choose to transcribe the name according to the [[Modern Standard Arabic|Literary Arabic]] pronunciation, which is the language of [[Quran]], pronounced as {{IPA|/&lt;!--unstressed--&gt;ʕabdul/}} and written ''Abdul...''. For other variations in spelling, see the [[#Arabic grammar|Arabic grammar]] section.

== Etymology ==
In Arabic language, the word {{lang|ar|عبد}} ''{{transl|ar|DIN|ʿabd}}'' means "slave" or "servant", from the [[triliteral root]] {{lang|ar|[[ع]]-[[ب]]-[[د]]}} ''{{transl|ar|ʕ-B-D}}'', which is also related to the word {{lang|ar|عبادة}} ''{{transl|ar|DIN|ʿibādah}}'', "worshiping". Therefore, the word has the positive connotation, in an Islamic sense, of worshiping and praising God, i.e. being a slave to God rather than idols.

=== Theophoric naming ===
Essentially there is no ''Abdul'', without the second part when written in Arabic, thus it appears as a component of many Arabic and specifically Muslim names, where it is the opening of a religiously based name, meaning: "Servant of..." with the last component of the name being one of the [[names of God in Islam]], which would form a Muslim Arabic [[theophoric name]]. Such as Abdullah simply meaning "Servant of God" while "Abdul Aziz" means "Servant of the Almighty" and so on.
The name ''Abdul Masih'', ("Servant of the [[Messiah]]") is an Arabic [[Christian]] equivalent.

In addition, ''Abdul'' is occasionally, though much more rarely, used in reference to a figure other than God. For example, the Indian name ''Abdul Mughal'', ("Servant of the Mughal Empire").

=== Derived theophoric names ===
{{Main|List of Arabic theophoric names}}
;The most common names are listed below
* [[Abdullah (name)|Abdullah]], [[Servant of God|Servant]] of [[Allah]]
* [[Abd al-Aziz|Abdulaziz]], Servant of ''the Almighty''
* [[Abdulkarim]], Servant of ''the most Generous''
* [[Abdur Rahim|Abdurrahim]], Servant of ''the Merciful''
* [[Abdur Rahman|Abdurrahman]], Servant of ''the Benevolent''
* [[Abdus Salam (name)|Abdussalam]], Servant of ''the Peaceful''
* [[Abdul Qadir|Abdulqadir]], Servant of ''the Powerful''

=== Arabic grammar ===
When followed by a [[Sun and moon letters|sun letter]], the ''l'' in ''[[Al-|al]]'' (normally pronounced colloquially ''el&amp;#x202f;'') assimilates to the initial consonant of the following noun, resulting in a [[Gemination|doubled consonant]]. For example, "Abdul Rahman", would be pronounced in [[Modern Standard Arabic|Literary Arabic]]: Abdur-Rahman {{IPA-ar|&lt;!--unstressed--&gt;ʕæbdʊr ræħˈmæːn|}}. When the definite article is followed by a [[moon letter]], no assimilation takes place.

Therefore, ''Abdul'' is not always used as the opening part of the name; if the second part starts with a sun letter, it may become forms including '''Abdun''', '''Abdur''', '''Abdus''', or '''Abdush''', the vowel in each name, similarly with ''Abdul'', is also open to differing transliterations.

=== Independent naming ===
''Abdul'' does not appear on its own as a male given name when written in Arabic. In some cultures, the theophoric part may appear to be a stand-alone middle name, or surname, thus confusing people as to whether ''Abdul'' is an accepted given name. Often if someone shortens his/her name, he may equally choose the theophoric part or ''Abdul''. However, ''Abdul'' by itself is sometimes used as an independent full given first name outside of Arabic-speaking societies. Sometimes ''Abdul'' is followed by a word describing [[Muhammad]] the Prophet, for example "Abd un Nabi", which means "slave/servant of the prophet".

'''Ariffin Mohammed''' (22 June 1941 – 22 April 2016) was the [[cult]] leader and founder of [[Sky Kingdom|Kerajaan Langit]] (''English'': Sky Kingdom), a sect founded by him in [[Malaysia]]. His movement had a commune based in [[Besut]], Terengganu, that was demolished by the Malaysian government in August 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Levett, Connie|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/world/bulldozers-etch-boundaries-of-religious-freedom/2005/08/19/1124435143759.html|title=Bulldozers etch boundaries of religious freedom|publisher=The Age|date=20 August 2005|accessdate=26 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ariffin Mohammed, also known as '''Ayah Pin''' (''Ayah'' is a common honorific meaning "father"), claimed to have direct contact with the heavens and was believed by his followers to be the reincarnation of Jesus, [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]], [[Shiva]], and [[Muhammad]]. Devotees of Sky Kingdom believe that one day, Ayah Pin will return as the [[Mahdi|Imam Mahdi]]. His followers considered him the king of the sky, and the supreme object of devotion for all religions.

==Personal life==
[[File:Isteri-isteri ayah pin.png|200px|thumb|Ayah Pin with his 4 wives]]

Ariffin was born in 22 July 1941 into a Muslim [[Malay (ethnic group)|Malay]] family in Beris Kubor Besar, Bachok, [[Kelantan]]. In 1953, Ariffin became seriously ill and he alleged that an [[angel]] had visited him. Twenty years later the angel returned and Ariffin began his spiritual career. Whether Ariffin was the founder is unclear; during this phase he may have been a follower of Hassan Tuhan (also known as Anak Rimau), apparently another claimant to divinity.

Around the mid-1980s, the Sky Kingdom commune was formed on its present site in Besut. Some reports state that the office of Islamic Affairs declared the group to be deviant at this time. In 1995, Sky Kingdom's signature building projects began, as per divine revelation. Two years later, Local Religious Affairs council (''Jawatankuasa Fatwa Majlis Agama Islam dan Adat Melayu Terengganu'') issued a [[fatwa]] against the group. Around this time, four adherents were arrested for renouncing [[Islam]], but they were later freed on grounds that as ex-Muslims Malaysia's [[sharia]] court no longer enjoys jurisdiction over them.

In 2001, Ariffin renounced [[Islam]]. The [[Sharia]] court accused him of contravening Section 25 of the ''Enakmen Pentadbiran Hal Ehwal Agama Islam 1986'' (Administration of Islamic Religious Affairs 1986), stating that his teachings and beliefs were false, deviant, corrupting and threatening to the public peace (''membawa ancaman kepada ketenteraman orang awam serta merosakkan akidah''). He pleaded guilty to the charge of "belittling Islam" (''menghina Islam''), and was jailed for 11 months and fined RM 2,900. The Religious Affairs Office hoped that Ariffin's arrest would prevent the movement's growth, however Sky Kingdom continued to attract new followers from among university students and [[Orang Asli]].&lt;ref name=thesun&gt;{{cite news|publisher=The Sun, Malaysia|title=Pie in the sky (Feature and interview)|url=http://www.sun2surf.com/article.cfm?id=10057|accessdate=26 December 2007|date=8 July 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 18 July 2005, a group of masked [[vigilantes]] attacked the group's headquarters, smashing windows and torching buildings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=The Sun, Malaysia|url=http://www.sun2surf.com/article.cfm?id=10213|title=Masked group attacks Ayah Pin commune|accessdate=26 December 2007|date=18 July 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two days later, 58 followers were arrested,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=The Sun, Malaysia|date=21 July 2005|url=http://www.sun2surf.com/article.cfm?id=10254|title=58 followers of Ayah Pin arrested|accessdate=26 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on 31 July three of Ariffin's four wives were also arrested in [[Kelantan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=Bernama|url=http://www.religionnewsblog.com/11861/three-wives-of-ayah-pin-detained|date= 31 July 2005|accessdate=26 December 2007|title=Three Wives of Ayah Pin Detained}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ariffin escaped arrest and remains at large as a fugitive wanted by the Malaysian authorities. Forty-five members face charges of failing to observe the government [[fatwa]] (i.e. for continuing to be members of a sect declared as deviant), which carries a fine up to RM 3,000 or two years in prison. One of those arrested faced an additional charge of "humiliating Islam" (for claiming not to be a Muslim). Court cases promise to revolve around the issue of religious freedom, which is theoretically guaranteed by the Malaysian constitution.

On 1 August 2005, officials of the Besut Land Office destroyed Sky Kingdom's various buildings, citing Section 129 of the National Land Code (which punishes unauthorised construction with land confiscation). The titular landowner is Ariffin's first wife, who apparently failed to appear in court for a hearing on the matter. On 1 September 2005, at a hearing, a trial date for 45 followers accused of violating the government fatwa was set for three days beginning 18 December that year. All of the accused are represented by Wan Haidi Wan Jusoh of Ubaidullah Aziz and Co, who unsuccessfully petitioned the court to order his name blacked out by the media. The group had previously experienced great difficulty in attracting legal representation, presumably owing to attorneys' fear of reprisals or negative publicity.&lt;ref name=nst&gt;{{cite news|publisher=New Straits Times|date=1 September 2005|accessdate=26 December 2007|url=http://www.religionnewsblog.com/12121/lawyer-to-represent-all-45-sky-kingdom-sect-followers|title=Lawyer to represent all 45 Sky Kingdom sect followers}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2007, after wide media coverage, the original Hulu Besut commune, now down to 24 members, had reportedly chosen a new leader—a former police chief inspector in his 30s. The group is suspicious of visitors, and routinely turns out the commune's lights whenever a car approaches at night, in order not to be found.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=Harian Metro|language=Malay|accessdate=26 December 2007|url=http://www.carigold.com/portal/forums/showthread.php?t=9060|title=Pemimpin baru 'Kerajaan Langit'}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 2009, Ariffin Mohamed was believed to have been residing in exile in [[Narathiwat]], [[Thailand]], just over the border from the Kelantan province.

===Death===
On 22 April 2016, Ariffin died in the home of his third wife, Che Jaharah Awang in Kampung Batu 13, Hulu Besut due to old age. He was 74. Before his death, it was reported that he had been suffering from various illnesses since fleeing from the authorities in 2005. His body was laid to rest at Batu 13 Cemetery, Hulu Besut, Kuala Terengganu.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailyexpress.com.my/news.cfm?NewsID=109076|title=Cult leader Ayah Pin dies|publisher=Daily Express|date=24 April 2016|accessdate=24 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3530">The '''Bonanza Kings''', also called the Silver Kings, was a nickname given to the four men who started a stock brokerage called ''Flood and O'Brien'', more commonly known as the Bonanza Firm. [[Bonanza]] is a Spanish term, meaning a rich ore body; in 1873, after gaining control of the [[Consolidated Virginia Mining Company]], they discovered a large vertical ore body more than 1,200 feet deep which became known as the "big bonanza".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Divine | first = Robert A. | title = America, past and present, Volume 2 | publisher = Longman | location = New York | year = 2002 | isbn = 978-0-321-08403-3 | oclc = 46507333}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Making a Fortune ==
In 1871, [[Irish-Americans]] [[John William Mackay]], [[James Graham Fair]], [[James Clair Flood]] and [[William S. O'Brien]], organized the Consolidated Virginia Silver Mine near [[Virginia City, Nevada]], from a number of smaller claims on the [[Comstock Lode]] and later added the nearby California mine. Mackay and Fair had the mining knowledge and Flood and O'Brien raised the money. The purchase price of the claims, later to become a fabulous source of wealth, was about $100,000. The original stock issue was 10,700 shares, selling for between $4 and $5 a share.

In 1873 the "big bonanza" was uncovered and San Francisco and the entire mining world were hurtled into a fever of excitement. The first stock issue was converted into two issues of 108,000 shares each, and by the middle of 1875 the speculative value of the two mines were close to $1,000,000,000. Shares went as high as $710.

For three years after the discovery of "big bonanza" the two mines produced $3,000,000 per month. In 1876, for exhibition purposes, $6,000,000 was taken in one month from both mines. Production began to fall off in 1879 but in twenty-two years of operation the two mines yielded more than $150,000,000 in [[silver]] and [[gold]], and paid $78,148,800 in dividends, making the four owners into some of America's wealthiest men.&lt;ref name=Wealthy100&gt;{{Citation | last=Klepper | first=Michael | last2=Gunther | first2=Michael | publication-date=1996 | title=The Wealthy 100: From Benjamin Franklin to Bill Gates—A Ranking of the Richest Americans, Past and Present | publisher=Carol Publishing Group | publication-place=[[Secaucus, New Jersey]] | pages=70–74 | isbn=978-0-8065-1800-8 | oclc=33818143}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''capodecina''' (literally 'head of ten',&lt;ref name=schneider83&gt;Schneider, ''Reversible Destiny'', p. 83&lt;/ref&gt; also called [[caporegime]] in the [[American Mafia]]) is the head of a decina, a branch within a [[Sicilian Mafia|Mafia]] family. In the larger families, a capodecina is selected by the head of the family and coordinates units of about ten people.&lt;ref name=paoli41&gt;Paoli, ''Mafia Brotherhoods'', p. 41&lt;/ref&gt;

Mafia members are organized under the supervision of a capodecina who reports to the [[capo famiglia]], the head of the Mafia family or [[cosca]]. The term derives from ''dieci'' (ten), suggesting that each would be in charge of ten men.&lt;ref name=gambetta111&gt;Gambetta, ''The Sicilian Mafia'', p. 111&lt;/ref&gt; The term was mentioned as early as the 1880s in Sicily to describe the organisation of the [[Fratellanza]], a Mafia-type organisation in [[Agrigento]], in the south of [[Sicily]].&lt;ref name=gambetta294&gt;Gambetta, ''The Sicilian Mafia'', p. 294&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mafioso [[Melchiorre Allegra]] spoke of a "capo della decina" in his 1937 testimony. He said a family split into groups of ten men each when it became unmanageably large.&lt;ref name=gambetta294/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Twentyfive pages of Allegra’s testimony were published in 1962 in the newspaper ''[[L'Ora]]'' by [[Mauro De Mauro]]. See: [http://www.exlegi.ox.ac.uk/resources/allegra.asp Testimony of Melchiorre Allegra] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120320184154/http://www.exlegi.ox.ac.uk/resources/allegra.asp |date=2012-03-20 }}, ExLEGI website&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Celebrity branding''' or '''celebrity endorsement''' is a form of advertising campaign or marketing strategy used by [[brand]]s, [[Company|companies]], or a [[Nonprofit organization|non-profit organization]] which involves celebrities or a well-known person using their social status or their fame to help promote a product, service or even raise awareness on environmental or social matters.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;What is celebrity endorsement?

== History ==
{{More footnotes|section|date=September 2017}}
Through the 1760s, royal endorsements were used as a type of celebrity branding to promote products. The first product that used celebrity endorsements was in the 1760s, where [[Wedgwood|Josiah Wedgwood and Sons]], producers of pottery and chinaware, used royal endorsements as a marketing device to show value in the company and promote others their product ("Celebrity Endorsement – Throughout the Ages, "2004).

In 1875&amp;ndash;1900s trade cards were introduced, this is where there would be a picture of a celebrity with a photo of the product. Typically, these trade cards would be given to consumers with the product or would be inserted on the packaging of the product itself, which would feature celebrities such as actors or sport stars.

Cigarette brands became hugely involved in celebrity branding, 'Kodas' cigarettes introduced baseball player cards into the packets of cigarettes as part of a customer loyalty scheme. This created a demand for consumers to buy more cigarettes so they could gain all the cards of all baseball players due to celebrity endorsement of the cards.

In the early 1930s the major trending celebrity endorsers were athletes, then by 1945 the trend changed and movie stars were the next big celebrity endorsers. In 1965, colour television was introduced to the marketing and there was a popular rising demand which was occurring, this in when television personalities and entertainers became a celebrity endorsement for communicating services and products.

Companies and firms in the 1980s then decided to start making products around celebrities ("Celebrity Endorsement – Throughout the Ages," 2004). An example of this is in 1984 when the company [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] noticed a talented and young basketball player called Michael Jordan. Michael Jordan then became Nike's celebrity brand ambassador for their sports industry. Nike extremely relied on Michael Jordan's social status to make the brand internationally well known.

Since companies started making products around celebrities and the celebrity becoming the brand ambassador for the company, athletes and entertainment celebrity's then started to negotiate salaries and pay out's for them representing the company due to the competition of other firms. Due to salaries always increasing because of the demands of the celebrity, usually, sales for the company that the celebrity was promoting would increase.

Furthermore, in the late 1900s, celebrity endorsements came to another level, instead of images of them promoting a brand, companies started to hold press conferences with the celebrity announcing special deals, this meant celebrities had now become a spokesman for the firm. As more companies got their celebrity ambassador to hold press conferences and announce special deals, sales for the brands were increasing immensely and more deals were introduced to the market.

In the year of the 2000s, studies have shown that by having a celebrity ambassador for a firm has improved sales enormously; such as Nike whom signed [[Tiger Woods]] in 1996 saw a $50million increase in sales on golf balls by 2002 ("Celebrity Endorsement – Throughout the Ages, "2004).

== Celebrity reach ==
Celebrity branding or celebrity endorsement of a company's product is effective largely because celebrities have the potential to reach a large number of prospective consumers.

Reach can be loosely defined as the number of people that have seen and/or heard the brand's intended message at least once (Belch &amp; Belch, 2012).&lt;ref name=":25"/&gt; If a brand or company decides to use celebrity branding to market their product, it is highly probable that they are deciding to attempt to reach the largest assortment of potential consumers possible, rather than reaching a small number of consumers but more frequently – which is described as frequency (Belch &amp; Belch, 2012).&lt;ref name=":25"/&gt;

An example of the usefulness of a celebrity's reach can be shown in statistics taken from telegraph.co.uk regarding the world's most followed [[Instagram]] celebrities. The most followed Instagram celebrity is [[Selena Gomez]], with each post that she makes being viewed by all or most of her 145 million followers. [[Cristiano Ronaldo]] is 2nd, with 144 million followers, and [[Ariana Grande]] is 3rd with 116 million followers.&lt;ref&gt;Hartmans, Avery. "Here Are the 10 Most-Followed Instagram Accounts in 2017." Business Insider, Business Insider, 29 Nov. 2017, https://www.businessinsider.com/instagram-top-10-people-2017-2017-11/&lt;/ref&gt; A direct brand endorsement from one of these celebrities would be significant were they to post a picture with the company's product encouraging their followers to go out and purchase it, and this is on Instagram alone. Imagine the effect of a celebrity posting an endorsement across all of their social media, (Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Snapchat, etc.). The reach that an A-list celebrity has possesses the ability to reach millions of potential consumers, and as a result can be an incredibly effective way to boost sales, or at the very least get a brand's name out there in a wider audience than before.

== Brand image ==
There is a high focus placed upon the importance of choosing a reliable, trustworthy celebrity to endorse or sponsor a company's product, while still balancing the celebrity's attractiveness, power, and similarity of the celebrity's public image with the company's overall current, or intended brand image.

Brand image can be described as "the set of beliefs held about a particular brand" (Kotler, 1988).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kotler|first1=K. L.|title=Marketing Management: Analysis, Planning and Control|date=1988|publisher=Prentice Hall|location=Englewood Cliffs, NJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research carried out by Keller &amp; Aaker in 1992 suggests that a brand with better positive brand image and attitudes is more likely to achieve heightened development within their relevant market. (Keller &amp; Aaker, 1992).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Keller|first1=K. L.|last2=Aaker|first2=D. A.|title=The Effects of Sequential Introduction of Brand Extensions|journal=Journal of Marketing Research|date=1992|volume=29|issue=1|pages=35–50|doi=10.2307/3172461}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, choosing a celebrity who is going to beneficially contribute to the existing or intended image and attitudes of the brand is vital to ensure the success of the celebrity branding.

== Brand alliance ==
The brand alliance is a business strategy that can involve the intentional process of associating two or more established brand names in a specific attempt to attract attention from consumers and thus increase the chances of earning additional sales for all the businesses involved.

== Brand recognition ==
Brand recognition is a huge part of celebrity branding. Brand recognition is where the general public is able to establish a brand from its attributes.  It is most successful when a brand is exposed without a company name and is then recognized by the customer through the visual signifiers such as logos, slogans, and colors. An Example of this is Coke whereby their signature color is red and consumers acknowledge that. Brand Recognition is extremely effective in promotional campaigns. To measure brand recognition and the effectiveness it has on promotional campaigns, companies will conduct experiments on study groups for results. If brands are equal in quality similar products brand recognition will always have an advantage of higher sales (Investopedia. 2016).

This quote explains that there are two types of celebrity endorsement: explicit and implicit.

An example of explicit endorsement can be seen through [[Beyoncé]]'s sponsorship deal with [[PepsiCo]]. In 2012 Beyoncé and PepsiCo sat down and penned a partnership deal that is estimated to be worth approx. $50 million, (Sisario, 2012),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sisario|first1=B.|title=In Beyonce Deal, Pepsi focuses on collaboration|url=https://www.nytimes.com|accessdate=March 29, 2016|date=December 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; that embraces the standard Pepsi print and TV commercials that Beyoncé will appear in, as well as a more unorthodox 'creative fund' for any future projects Beyoncé chooses to take on (Casserly, 2012).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Casserly|first1=M.|title=Beyonce's $50 Million Pepsi Deal|url=https://www.forbes.com|website=Forbes|accessdate=March 29, 2016|date=December 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is an effective explicit endorsement because not only does Beyoncé have incredible reach, being one of the world's biggest female popstars, but also the term 'partnership' feels more genuine for consumers which may make them more likely to believe that Beyoncé is endorsing the Pepsi product because she believes in the product and the company behind it, rather than some celebrity endorsements which feel forced, or where consumers see through the endorsement and assume it's just a business decision on behalf of the celebrity to make some extra cash.

An example of implicit endorsement can be explained by noticing the growing number of 'Beats by Dre' portable speakers that have been appearing in pop and hip-hop music videos, (such music videos include Lady Gaga, Miley Cyrus, Nicki Minaj and Britney Spears (Ortiz, 2014&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ortiz|first1=E.|title=40 Music Videos With Blatant Beats by Dre Product Placement|url=http://www.au.complex.com/music/2014/07/blatant-beats-by-dre-product-placement-in-music-videos/|website=Complex|accessdate=March 30, 2016|date=July 11, 2014}}{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;)). The celebrities involved are not expressly mentioning the Beats product within their music videos, but their presence amongst these celebrities convey the message of it being a high-quality product associated with those of a high social class, particularly those who are industry leaders in music

== Advantages ==
* Celebrity endorsements can build brand equity. An example of this is Nike, prior to Michael Jordan Nike mostly sponsored tennis and track athletes and decided to expand their market, which increased sales to become a multibillion-dollar company.
* Celebrity endorsement is used as an advertising strategy, by using celebrity status and image, to promote a brand’s recognition, recall, and differentiation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Awasthi|first=Ashwini K.|last2=Choraria|first2=Sapna|date=2015-10-30|title=Effectiveness of Celebrity Endorsement Advertisements: The Role of Customer Imitation Behaviour|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0973258615597412|journal=Journal of Creative Communications|language=en|volume=10|issue=2|pages=215–234|doi=10.1177/0973258615597412}}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp; 
* It helps customers to remember advertisements when seeing a celebrity that has already got a brand of their own, it will bring customers to try or purchase the product.
* It also helps the brand to stand out over a brand that does not use celebrity branding.

=== Pros&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; ===
* Increased attention to the product and the brand
* Polishing the image of the brand
* Introduction of the brand to new and wider market
* Repositioning of the brand
* Guarantee of successful advertising of the brand

=== Advantages for sales and advertising ===
The advantages of celebrity branding are having a product that the endorser likes and utilizes and incorporates into their lifestyle as well as having some knowledge about the product. This would be an advantage in advertising the product because the endorser would be more passionate about the product and promote the product in a believable way that consumers would be persuaded by (Halonen-Knight and Hurmerinta, 2010).

Celebrity endorsements have considerable influence in sales when promoting a product and brand, as they can supply information, which is focused on the benefits and remarkable features of the product in an unbiased and standard form, which has a great effect on the business revenue (Popescu, G.H, 2014).

An advantage of celebrity branding is by using social networks, as it is a less cost-effective scheme of assembling and distributing information so that consumers become more aware of the product before purchasing it, as well as having great online consumer reviews will increase sales due to great advertisement is done by the company/brand and the celebrity promoting the product.

The most effective advertisements are those that are supported by celebrity endorsements. These celebrity endorsements result in beneficial results for the product or brand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sridevi|first1=J|title=Effectiveness of celebrity advertisement on select FMCG – An Empirical Study.|journal=Procedia Economics and Finance|date=2014|volume=11|pages=276–288|doi=10.1016/s2212-5671(14)00196-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Celebrities in advertising make the advertisement more noticeable to consumers, they stand out from the media clutter and are therefore a good basis of capturing and retaining consumer attention (Muda et al., 2012).&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Muda|first1=M|last2=Musa|first2=R|last3=Putit|first3=L|title=Breaking through the clutter in media environment: How do celebrities help?|journal=Procedia - Social and Behavioral Sciences|date=2012|volume=42|pages=374–382|doi=10.1016/j.sbspro.2012.04.201}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies have shown that using celebrities in advertising increases the message's persuasiveness which results in consumers having a better recall and recognition for the product or brand&lt;ref name=":19"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zhou|first1=L|last2=Whitla|first2=P|title=How negative celebrity publicity influences consumer attitudes: The mediating role of moral reputation.|journal=Journal of Business Research|date=2013|volume=66|issue=8|pages=1013–1020|doi=10.1016/j.jbusres.2011.12.025}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Zhou &amp; Whitla, 2013). Muda et al. (2014) state that having celebrities in advertisements positively influences ad effectiveness measures (i.e. consumer attitudes towards the brand, consumer attitudes towards the ad, and purchase intentions).&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Muda|first1=M|last2=Musa|first2=R|last3=Mohamed|first3=R|last4=Borhan|first4=H|title=Celebrity entrepreneur endorsement and advertising effectiveness|journal=Procedia - Social and Behavioral Sciences|date=2014|volume=130|pages=11–20|doi=10.1016/j.sbspro.2014.04.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Celebrities are perceived to hold qualities such as attractiveness, expertise, trustworthiness and likeability, which advertiser's hope will be transferred to the brand or product consequently creating positive images for that product or brand (Muda et al., 2012).&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":15"/&gt; Many consumers idolise celebrities and strive to imitate their lives with the clothes they wear and products they consume (Aureliano-Silva et al., 2015).&lt;ref name=":16"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Aureliano-Silva|first1=L|last2=Lopes|first2=E|last3=Freire|first3=O|last4=Silva|first4=D|title=The brand's effect on the evaluation of advertising endorsed by celebrities: An experimental study|journal=Brazilian Business Review|date=2015|volume=12|issue=4|pages=57–78|doi=10.15728/bbr.2015.12.4.3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Celebrities create meaning for the consumer through their interactions with products in advertising (Muda et al., 2012;&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; Aureliano-Silva et al., 2015).&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":16"/&gt;

== Disadvantages ==
Due to the high-profile lives of celebrities that are constantly being reviewed and scrutinized by the media, there are risks of using celebrities in advertising (Jin &amp; Phua, 2014).&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt;

The term eclipsing (also referred to as overshadowing) is used to describe the instance where a celebrity in an advertisement overshadows the product being advertised by occupying more time or space than the product being advertised, this is a negative for the advertiser as the product is not the main focus for the consumers (Ilicic &amp; Webster, 2014).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ilicic|first1=J|last2=Webster|first2=C|title=Eclipsing: when celebrities overshadow the brand|journal=Psychology &amp; Marketing|date=2014|volume=31|issue=11|pages=1040–1050|doi=10.1002/mar.20751}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is crucial for the effectiveness of the advertisement to ensure that the product is the focus of attention (Keel &amp; Nataraajan, 2012).&lt;ref name=":20"&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Nataraajan|first2=R|date=2012|title=Celebrity endorsements and beyond: New avenues for celebrity branding|journal=Psychology &amp; Marketing|volume=29|issue=9|pages=690–703|doi=10.1002/mar.20555|last1=Keel|first1=A}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Overexposure refers to the negative effect that is a result of when a celebrity endorses multiple products of a similar type at one time (Muda et al., 2012).&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; Consumers can become more sceptical of the celebrity's motives to endorse products and therefore may perceive the celebrity to be less credible when endorsing multiple products (Ilicic &amp; Webster, 2011).&lt;ref name=":21"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ilicic|first1=J|last2=Webster|first2=C|title=Effects of multiple endorsements and consumer–celebrity attachment on attitude and purchase intention|journal=Australasian Marketing Journal (AMJ)|date=2011|volume=19|issue=4|pages=230–237|doi=10.1016/j.ausmj.2011.07.005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Celebrity endorsements do not guarantee long-term favorable effects, due to the risk to advertisers that the celebrity endorser may get caught up in a scandal, creating negative perceptions to consumers (Zhou &amp; Whitla, 2013).&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt; Common celebrity scandals involve alcohol, drug, sex, or crime related events (Muda et al., 2012).&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; These scandals can have a negative effect on the image of the brand, as consumers' negative perceptions of the celebrity endorser may be transferred to the brand, therefore negatively influencing sales of the brand's products (Zhou &amp; Whitla, 2013).&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt; One of the largest profile celebrity endorsement scandals of recent history was the infidelity scandal of Tiger Woods in 2009, at the time, Tiger Woods was a brand ambassador for Nike golf apparel and footwear. It has been estimated that Nike lost approximately US$5–12billion due to this scandal (Zhou &amp; Whitla, 2013).&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt;

Consumers' views of the celebrity endorser may change, due to changes in the celebrity's image (Muda et al., 2012).&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; Changes in image may be a result of injury, physical appearance, change in marital status, or a decline in professional visibility and this can result in the celebrity endorser no longer suiting the product or brand being endorsed (Muda et al., 2012;&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; Keel &amp; Nataraajan, 2012&lt;ref name=":20" /&gt;).
* Brand images can change if celebrities cause themselves a bad name or reputation.
* Celebrities can be overexposed. An example of this is Tiger Woods when he worked for so many companies his credibility started to suffer. 
* Celebrities start to overshadow brands. Customers will start to focus on the celebrity rather than the product.

=== Cons ===
Using celebrity endorsement has its risks as well as its benefits.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Erdogan | first1 = B.Z. | year = 1999 | title = Celebrity Endorsement: A Literature Review | url = | journal = Journal of Marketing Management | volume = 15 | issue = 4| pages = 291–314 | doi=10.1362/026725799784870379}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the opportunities provided by the endorsement may have two sides to it, making it a potential risk as well.
* Celebrity may overshadow the product: There may be a chance of the celebrity getting more attention than the product being endorsed, which may lead to consumers remembering only the celebrity than the product.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Patel | first1 = P.C. | year = 2009 | title = Impact of Celebrity Endorsement on Brand Acceptance | url = | journal = ICFAI Journal of Consumer Behavior | volume = 4 | issue = 1| pages = 36–45 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Credibility of Celebrity endorsements: Consumers are now more aware of how advertising and celebrity endorsements work, which brings them to question celebrity credibility within advertisements as more consumers are starting to voice their opinions asking if the brand or the product should be trusted based on the celebrity that is being paid to endorse the product.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== Bad strategy ===
Through celebrity branding there are many disadvantages for businesses that choose to take this strategy. Many disadvantages for celebrity branding could involve the celebrity overshadowing the business or having too much over exposure, other factors could also include bad image change or public controversy. The celebrity the business decides to use as the face of their campaign could have a negative impact on the organisation due to their previous image or a decline in their fame. If companies designing their new merchandise or product to fit the celebrity's image, the product may not be appealing to some consumers due to lack of trustworthiness, attractiveness or knowledge, and this will create a loss in purchases. Businesses can also run the risk of losing loyal customers to other competitors.

== Risks ==
When a celebrity is promoting a brand there can be risks involved, where there is a miscommunication between the consumer and the representation of the product. In some cases, there is no connection between the product and the celebrity, which can become an effective or a defective result due to the position and relevance of the product. When Celebrity Branding does not work out for a firm, the celebrity can be seen as a scheme to promote the person as a marketing instrument. Ideally, some consumers believe that companies who use celebrity endorsers, as a marketing strategy to promote a product should choose an endorser who utilizes and enjoys using the product. Therefore, ethically they are trusting the brand and showing potential consumers the effects of the product and making the advertisement more believable. Rather than a celebrity endorser who is promoting the brand just because of their social status and there is no relevance between the product and the celebrity (Popescu, G.H, 2014).

Companies who use celebrity endorsers are at a risk financially, whether they are choosing the right celebrity endorser to represent their brand and return the favor with an increase in sales, or for the brand to become known on a wider scale. Firms are also taking risks in hoping that their chosen celebrity endorser will portray their brand in the correct way, because any small or big mistake can cost the company in a negative outcome, especially due to the celebrity's social status it can affect a huge audience. This could be due to miscommunication between the firm and the endorser advertising the product or service (Halonen-Knight and Hurmerinta, 2010).

Celebrity endorsement usually impacts the feelings of the customers and the position they have concerning the advertisement and the brands, thus enhancing the purchase intentions and the sales (Bondrea and $tefanescu-Mihäilä, 2004). Therefore, if there is a communication error, it can defeat the sale as well as portray the brand negatively. Financially, firms can invest up to millions of dollars when choosing a celebrity to promote their brand; therefore they do not wish for an undesirable impact.

=== Risk for companies ===
Although for a business, hiring a celebrity to endorse their brand would seem to be an effective and profitable way of expanding the growth of their brand – there is a severe risk with choosing this type of marketing strategy which could lead to damaging impacts on the business therefore choosing this strategy could be an beneficial or a huge disadvantage.

When observing the communication process, the three main factors when communicating information are through the sender, channel and receiver but then considering the noise surrounding it – noise being anything that can interfere with the intended message sent from the source to the receiver. (Belch, G. E., &amp; Belch, M. A. (2012).)&lt;ref name=":25"/&gt; A company when choosing the celebrity to represent their brand, they have to carefully examine the reputation and image of this person and whether it coincides and complements with their product and purpose. A business needs to have confidence in this celebrity to remain acting a suitable way which does not diminish the reputation of the brand otherwise there could be a definite negative impact on the way a consumer interprets a message from the brand.

For example, in recent news the global Tennis star Maria Sharapova who has been a role model and highest paid female athlete ("Maria Sharapova: Is star's brand damaged goods? – CNN.com," 2016)&lt;ref&gt;Maria Sharapova: Is star's brand damaged goods? - CNN.com. (2016). Retrieved from http://edition.cnn.com/2016/03/30/tennis/maria-sharapova-brand-endorsement-sponsorship-drugs-sugarpova/index.html&lt;/ref&gt; for the past 11 years since she was 17 was caught in a scandal after she failed a major drugs test. Sharipova, endorsing some of the biggest and most successful organisations like Nike, Poshe and Evian – was immediately dropped by these businesses as soon as word was out about the drug failure as it was evident that this would be harmful to the companies' reputation and would leave consumers with a different and undesired view of their brand. It is shown that even the most seemingly reliable and trustworthy celebrities can slip up and cause brand image and reputation to be put on the line.

The news of controversy surrounding a celebrity would be a definite source of noise and it alters the message a brand is trying to convey. Consumers would already have specific connotations and personal views on the celebrity after negative news about them has surfaced, which would consequently directly affect that same consumer's image of the company. This is known as the term 'Source-related Thoughts' where the source significantly sways the thoughts of the receiver. It has been said that "If consumers find a particular spokesman annoying or untrustworthy, they are less likely to accept what this source has to say...Receivers who react favourably to the source generate favourable thoughts, or source bolsters." (Belch, G. E., &amp; Belch, M. A. (2012).)&lt;ref name=":25" /&gt; This would mean that if a company chose to market their brand using a celebrity they would have to make sure their target market would appeal to this person as they develop feelings for the consumer regardless of the brand their product. Therefore, there would no use in using a youthful teenaged movie star to endorse an anti-wrinkle cream or a very misogynistic politician to promote a campaign to women – people would not be in favour to trust or like the business because they dislike or do not relate with the celebrity spokesman representing it. Choosing a celebrity in which a business' target market will appeal to will convey and carry on the message effectively.

The entire aim of marketing and advertising is to draw attention to your business and persuade or manipulate the target market into consuming goods or services. The more attention brought to the company, the larger opportunities gained to communicate with consumers. With using celebrity branding, there is an advantage as because this person already has a large audience and following, attention can be drawn easily. It's how the business uses this attention decides whether the outcome is beneficial or negative to the brand because there are dear impacts if an error is made due to the many people watching and making judgments. The theory of market senses/sensory marketing is where a marketer relates to an audience on an emotional level. With taking advantage of the already built attention, the right celebrity branding whether the brand is looking for a celebrity with sex appeal or a reputation of charity or generosity, these can develop an emotional response and connection from consumers which can benefit the business greatly. Though of course if celebrities possess undesired traits, this can generate a negative emotional response which would turn consumers away from a brand. (Heath, R., Brandt, D., &amp; Nairn, A. (2006).)&lt;ref&gt;[https://autonline.aut.ac.nz/bbcswebdav/pid-3617611-dt-content-rid-6697718_3/xid-6697718_3 Heath, R., Brandt, D., &amp; Nairn, A. (2006). Brand relationships: Strengthened by emotion, weakened by attention. ''Journal of Advertising Research, 46''(4), 410-419.]{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Choosing to use the celebrity branding strategy to connect to  consumers is either win or lose. With the future being so unexpected, using a celebrity to endorse a product and business could bring huge positives or could have immensely damaging effects but there is no way of predicting which outcome the business will get. By choosing the perceived most trustworthy and suitable celebrity relative to the business would be the safest bet to gain success and prevent reputation damage. Businesses need to outweigh the pros and cons and decide whether they are prepared to take the risk.

==== Effectiveness ====
Kelman (1961) claims that a source (defined as the individual or group that intends to communicate an idea, or message to their target audience, also known as a sender (Finne &amp; Grönroos, 2009&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Finne|first1=A.|last2=Gronroos|first2=C.|title=Rethinking marketing communication: From integrated marketing communication to relationship communication|journal=Journal of Marketing Communications|date=2009|volume=15|issue=2-3|pages=179–195|doi=10.1080/13527260902757654}}&lt;/ref&gt;)), will be more effective in their objective to convince consumers to purchase a product if the receivers perceive them as ''attractive, credible, and powerful'' (Kelman, 1961&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kelman|first1=H. C.|title=Processes of Opinion Change|journal=Public Opinion Quarterly|date=1961|volume=25|issue=1|pages=57–78|doi=10.1086/266996}}&lt;/ref&gt;). The attractiveness of the sender is determined by how much the audience likes the person that is making the statements about the company/product. The credibility can refer to how much we trust the individual's opinions/morals, and how convincing their belief in the product that they are sponsoring is (Rifon et al., 2004&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rifon|first1=N. J.|last2=Choi|first2=S. M.|last3=Trimble|first3=C. S.|last4=Li|first4=H.|title=Congruence effects in sponsorship: The mediating role of sponsor credibility and consumer attributions of sponsor motive|journal=Journal of Marketing|date=2004|volume=33|issue=1|pages=30–42|doi=10.1080/00913367.2004.10639151}}&lt;/ref&gt;). An individual is considered powerful when they can "affect behaviour because of perceived reward or punishment" (Dahlén et al., 2010).

One of the clearest examples of the importance of a celebrity's credibility when endorsing a product can be seen with Tiger Woods's endorsement of Nike in 2000. The involvement of Tiger Woods within Nike "resulted in the acquisition of approximately 4.5 million customers and $60 million in profit" (CBS Interactive Inc., 2010&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=CBS Interactive Inc.|title=Did Nike Really Gain From Tiger Woods' Scandal, as the Numbers Suggest?|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/|website=CBS|accessdate=March 29, 2016|date=December 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;). However, following the 2009 scandal, (Tiger was caught sleeping with around 7 women while married to his wife (Bacon &amp; Busbee, 2012&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bacon|first1=S.|last2=Busbee|first2=J.|title=The Complete Tiger Woods Timeline, from Escalade to Divorce|url=http://www.sports.yahoo.com/golf/blog/devil_ball_golf/post/The-complete-Tiger-Woods-timeline-from-Escalade?urn=golf,264574|website=Yahoo Sports|accessdate=March 29, 2016|date=August 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;)), Nike began to see shifts in their sales. According to a study conducted by Carnegie Mellon University's Tepper School of Business, "the scandal cost Nike $1.7 million in sales and lost the company nearly 105,000 customers..." (Carnegie Mellon University, 2010&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Carnegie Mellon University|editor1-last=Burd|editor1-first=M.|title=Impact of Tiger Woods on Nike and Golf|journal=Economic Value of Celebrity Endorsement|date=2010|page=para 5}}&lt;/ref&gt;). This just goes to show that although Tiger Woods was still attractive to consumers, and still a very powerful man, he was no longer credible and as a result his endorsement in the later years did more harm than good.

Celebrity branding is used to help create a further image as a brand. The use of celebrities helps to humanize the brand. This creates a brand identity as consumers begin to relate the celebrities' characteristics with the brands.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ambroise|first=Laure|last2=Pantin-Sohier|first2=Gaëlle|last3=Valette-Florence|first3=Pierre|last4=Albert|first4=Noel|title=From endorsement to celebrity co-branding: Personality transfer|url=http://www.palgrave-journals.com/doifinder/10.1057/bm.2014.7|journal=Journal of Brand Management|volume=21|issue=4|pages=273–285|doi=10.1057/bm.2014.7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There are different ways CELEBRITY BRANDING CAN BE USED IN PAID AND UNPAID ENDORSEMENT METHODS.

Celebrity branding can take several different forms, from the appearance of a celebrity in advertisements for a product, service or charity, to a celebrity attending PR events, creating his or her own line of products or services, or funher name as a brand.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}} The most popular forms of celebrity brand lines are for clothing and fragrances. Some singers, models and film stars have at least one licensed product or service which bears their name.{{example needed|date=February 2015}} The use of a celebrity or of a sports professional can have a huge impact on a brand. For example, sales of [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] golf apparel and footwear doubled after [[Tiger Woods]] was signed up on a sponsorship deal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fmcg.ie/celebrity-endorsements-on-the-rise/ FMCG Ireland]&lt;/ref&gt;

Celebrities also provide voice-overs for advertising. Some celebrities have distinct voices which are recognizable even when faces are not visible on a screen. This is a more subtle way to add celebrity branding to a product or service. An example of such an advertising campaign is [[Sean Connery]]'s voice-over for [[Level 3 Communications]].{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

Celebrity branding is a global phenomenon and it assumes paramount importance in countries like India,{{citation needed|date=February 2015}} where the public may treat celebrities as virtual demi-gods. There is a certain correlation{{which|date=December 2014}} between successful celebrity branding and brand endorsements. More recently,{{when|date=February 2015}} advertisers have begun attempting to quantify and qualify the use of celebrities in their [[marketing]] campaigns by evaluating their{{whose?|date=February 2015}} awareness, appeal, and relevance to a brand's image and the celebrity's influence on [[consumer]] buying behavior.{{citation needed|date=February 2015|reason=Source unknown}}

However, in some cases the celebrity did not give permission to be associated with the brand and was wrongly attributed to the brand. For example, on July 23, 2008, [[Taco Bell]] launched their "Why Pay More?" campaign and used [[50 Cent]]'s name and trademark as a way to endorse their low-cost menus.&lt;ref name=MTV&gt;{{cite web|last1=Reid|first1=Shaheem|title=50 Cent Sues Taco Bell|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1591453/50-cent-sues-taco-bell/|website=MTV News|publisher=MTV|accessdate=9 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 50 Cent was unaware of this endorsement and therefore sought out legal action. He filed a lawsuit against Taco Bell and sued for $4 million.&lt;ref name="MTV"/&gt; He won the case.

=== Paid endorsement ===

[[File:Henry Bond for Mulberry.jpg|thumb|In 2001, actress [[Anna Friel]] and her partner [[David Thewlis]], who posed for fashion photographer [[Henry Bond]], were reportedly paid £50,000 to appear in [[Mulberry (company)|Mulberry]]'s 2001 autumn/winter campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Friel the Heat|url=http://www.vogue.co.uk/news/2001/07/31/friel-the-heat|website=Vogue News UK|publisher=British Vogue|accessdate=28 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Paid endorsement or overt endorsement involves a contract between the brand and the celebrity for the celebrity to represent the brand in an advertising campaign. The contract may involve some restraints on the celebrity's act; such as cutting their hair or endorsing a direct competitor.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Lea-Greenwood, &amp; Gaynor (2012). Celebrity. ''Fashion Marketing Communications''. 74-77&lt;/ref&gt;
Paid endorsements involves a contract between the brand and the celebrity to represent the brand. The celebrity will generally gain a sum of money for endorsing the brand but also have a few guidelines to follow.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Van der Waldt | first1= De la Rey | last2 = Schleritzko | first2 = N.E.A.| last3 = Van Zyl | first3 = K. | year = 2007 | title = Paid versus  unpaid celebrity endorsement in advertising: An exploration | url = | journal = African Journal of Business Management | volume = 1 | issue = | page = 7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some methods of paid endorsements are: 
* Advertisements
Advertisements can include television advertisements, radio, billboards, or magazine posters showing the celebrity in the brands advertisement to help increase the products image. The celebrity could be seen using the product, or the main character, as being seen in the advertisement can help viewers associate them with the brand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Walker | first1 = M. | last2 = Langmeyer | first2 = L. | last3 = Langmeyer | first3 = D. | year = 1992 | title = Celebrity endorsers: Do you get what you pay for? | url = | journal = The Journal of Consumer Marketing | volume = 9 | issue = 2| pages = 69–76 | doi=10.1108/07363769210037033}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of Celebrity Branding in an advertisement is George Clooney in Nespressos 'What else' advertising campaign. Celebrities used for voice-overs or radio advertisements generally have a distinct voice that viewers will recognize like Morgan Freeman's voice.
* PR Events
Brands use events for the celebrity to be seen at, as it helps show their support or association with the brand. Having photos taken of the celebrities at the event makes the viewers associate them with them supporting the brand, making the viewer associate a positive connection. This can be done through celebrities hosting the brands event, like [[Victoria's Secret Fashion Show|Victoria Secret Show]], using celebrities to perform on the catwalk.  
* Social Media
Celebrities promote the brand using social media using social media, like Instagram, Facebook or Snapchat. This helps the brand target the celebrities' followers to create an association between the two.

Social media sites, including Twitter, Instagram and Facebook, are a popular non-traditional medium for celebrities endorsing products and brands (Jin &amp; Phua, 2014&lt;ref name=":17"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jin|first1=S|last2=Phua|first2=J|title=Following celebrities' tweets about brands: The impact of Twitter-based electronic word-of-mouth on consumers' source credibility perception, buying intention, and social identification with celebrities|journal=Journal of Advertising|date=2014|volume=43|issue=2|pages=181–195|doi=10.1080/00913367.2013.827606}}&lt;/ref&gt;). The advantages of using celebrity endorsements on social media is the large reach that celebrities have. This means that large audiences are exposed to the influence of the celebrity to encourage positive purchasing behaviours towards the brand (Jin &amp; Phua, 2014).&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt; In 2013, the most followed accounts on Twitter with more than 30million followers each were Justin Bieber, Lady Gaga and Katy Perry (Jin &amp; Phua, 2014).&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt; Jin and Phua, (2014) state that the more followers someone has the greater perceived social influence they hold.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt; As well as having reach to their followers, any post may be shared by their followers to extend that reach to further audiences (Jin &amp; Phua, 2014&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt;). Another benefit of using social media for celebrity endorsements is the interactive nature of this non-traditional media, (Cunningham &amp; Bright, 2012),&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt; this helps to build the relationship between the celebrity endorser, consumer and the brand.

In 2009, growing concern about consumers being misled by celebrity endorsers on social media platforms led to the Federal Trade Commission introducing a set of guidelines to protect consumers called "Guides Concerning the Use of Endorsements and Testimonials in Advertising" (Cunningham &amp; Bright, 2012).&lt;ref name=":18"&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Bright|first2=L|date=2012|title=The tweet is in your court: Measuring attitude towards athlete endorsements in social media|journal=International Journal of Integrated Marketing Communications|volume=4|issue=2|pages=73–87|last1=Cunningham|first1=N}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, celebrity endorsers are required to advise consumers when they have been paid to endorse a product (Cunningham &amp; Bright, 2012),&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt; this can be done through the use of hashtags #ad, #spon, #paid
* Instagram
The hiring of a spokesman or celebrity has increased as a [[digital marketing]] technique. Celebrities have been endorsing products and services of businesses on television and print media for decades. However, the [[social networking site]] Instagram is now often used as a platform for businesses to market products or services either through a third parties page, such as a celebrate, or directly through their own Instagram page.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ha,|first=A.,|date=2015|title=An Experiment: Instagram Marketing Techniques and Their Effectiveness.|url=http://digitalcommons.calpoly.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1206&amp;context=comssp&amp;sei-redir=1&amp;referer=https%3A%2F%2Fscholar.google.co.uk%2Fscholar%3Fq%3Dinstagram%2Bmarketing%26btnG%3D%26hl%3Den%26as_sdt%3D0%252C5%26as_ylo%3D2013%26oq%3DInstagram%2B#search=%22instagram%20marketing%22|journal=|volume=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Having started as a social networking site, Instagram has evolved into a successful marketing tool. What is special about Instagram is the fact that it encourages electronic [[word of mouth]], which exist solely on the concept of sharing. Companies can simply tag the username for the businesses Instagram page to allow other potential consumers to browse through that Instagram account in just one click.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Latiff,|first=Z, A.,|last2=Safiee|first2=N, A, S.|date=2015|title=New Business Set Up for Branding Strategies on Social media – Instagram.|url=|journal=Procedia Computer Science|volume=72|pages=13–23|doi=10.1016/j.procs.2015.12.100}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The culture of advertising on Instagram came naturally when businesses realized that celebrities have a direct means of communication to their target demographic. According to the Telegraph (2015), the ten most popular Instagram accounts are all celebrities who all have around 30 million followers. By partnering with one of these celebrities, businesses are already reaching an engaged and targeted audience of 30 million people. Many of America's top-earning celebrities Instagram accounts are continually promoting products such as health supplements, vitamins and detox teas. These aren't spontaneous proclamations, but rather posts paid for by brands to advertise products to the celebrities' sizable following.&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/natalierobehmed/2016/11/16/inside-the-business-of-celebrity-instagram-endorsements/#17414cf95724|title=Inside The Business Of Kardashian-Jenner Instagram Endorsements|last=Robehmed|first=Natalie|date=2016|website=Forbes|publisher=|access-date=18 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On Instagram alone a profile with three-to-seven million followers can charge as much as $75,000 per endorsement, even a profile with 50,000 to 500,000 followers might make $1000 for a post on Instagram. At the top end of the digital celebrity pay scale some posts can earn around $300,000, especially when Instagram pictures can be easily linked to other social media platforms such as [[Facebook]] or [[Twitter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dolan|first=Rebecca|date=2016|title=Social media stack up: Pros and cons of the 'big five'.|url=https://search.informit.com.au/documentSummary;dn=077567503573483;res=IELHSS|journal=Australian and New Zealand Grapegrower and Winemaker|volume=627|pages=68}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the celebrities that is most well known for promoting brands on her Instagram page is [[Kim Kardashian]]. She currently posts advertisements for at least eight different brands, ranging from jewelry to morning sickness medication, with an estimated earning of $51 million from posting on her social media channels alone.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; Similarly, footballer [[Cristiano Ronaldo]] endorses [[TAG Heuer]] through his Instagram account, he dutifully thanks them for the watches he has been given as a 'gift' and signs of his posts on Instagram with the companies advertising slogan.

Global brands are expanding the use of digital communication via social media. Companies who use Instagram as a form of digital communication include, high fashion brands such as [[Christian Louboutin]] and [[Chanel]]. Both have been known to send products to influential users in return for an Instagram post and acknowledgement.

[[Puma SE]] have recently increased their digital marketing campaigns through the use of sponsored adverts and endorsements on Instagram.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Strategic Digital Marketing|last=Greenberg|first=E|last2=Kates|last3=A|publisher=McGraw Hill Education|year=2014|isbn=|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This now allows products to be bought directly from the social media platform.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://m.thedrum.com/news/2015/02/12/puma-introduce-shoppable-ads-across-all-social-media.|title=Puma introduce shoppable ads across all social media.|last=Mortimer|first=N|date=2016|website=The Drum|access-date=1 April 2017}}{{dead link|date=August 2017|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; As well as facilitating interactions with the companies target audience, promoting products through instagram can also generate media coverage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hanna|first=R.|last2=Rohm|first2=A,|last3=Crittenden|first3=V.L,|date=|title=We’re all connected: The power of the social media ecosystem|url=|journal=Business horizons|volume=54|issue=3|pages=265–273|doi=10.1016/j.bushor.2011.01.007}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Puma have aligned with [[Kylie Jenner]] to create the Puma Fierce trainer; reactions on social media to this collaboration from the likes of [[Kanye West]] have increased the awareness of the product.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/watch-kylie-jenners-fierce-new-7674739.|title=Watch Kylie Jenner’s fierce new Puma advert after Kanye West insisted it would 'never’ happen|last=McGeorge|first=A.|date=2016|website=The Mirror|access-date=14 April 2016}}{{dead link|date=August 2017|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Celebrity advertisement posts on Instagram can generate upwards of 10 million engagements, according to social media data provider D’marie Archive. This makes these forms digital marketing communication an attractive bet for advertisers seeking millennial eyes. Furthermore, the principle analyst at eMarketer Debra Williamson states that these celebrities influence teens and young adults when it comes to making a purchase, firms can reach out to people through Instagram that otherwise would not be reached.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tsimonis|first=G.|last2=Dimitriadis|first2=S.|date=2014|title=Brand strategies in social media.|url=|journal=Marketing Intelligence &amp; Planning|volume=32|issue=3|pages=328–344|doi=10.1108/mip-04-2013-0056}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is because visual images tend to be more engaging than text alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Guidry|first=J.D.|last2=Messner|first2=M.|last3=Jin|first3=Y.|last4=Medina-Messner|first4=V.|date=2015|title=From #mcdonaldsfail to #dominossucks: An analysis of instagram images about the 10 largest fast food companies.|url=|journal=Corporate Communications|volume=20|issue=3|pages=344|doi=10.1108/ccij-04-2014-0027}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instagram has become an interactive channel that brands can use to communicate with their customers on a more personal level.

As Instagram has transformed into one of the most influential forms of mass communication, the rules surrounding Instagram advertisements have been developed overtime to ensure that institutions do not misuse the platform.

=== Unpaid endorsement ===
Unpaid endorsement or covert endorsement occurs when a celebrity wears or uses the product of a certain brand because they like it.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Brands can send free samples to celebrities to try out their product, and review or use on social media to give their opinion on the product. Lots of beauty companies use this to get YouTube reviewers to review their product so they get free [[advertising]]. Sometimes a celebrity is given merchandise by a brand to use or wear in public where there is maximum exposure, such as an event. This is called "gifting"&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; and the celebrity might endorse the brand by taking a photo of the gift and putting it on their social media account for their fans and followers to see. Whilst the "gifting" may appear to be unpaid, costs are associated with this endorsement, as the brand does not have any contract in place with the celebrity and will have little or no protection against what happens during the unpaid endorsement.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
Celebrities are seen wearing or using the product due to liking it themselves. They could be seen wearing the product in public or in photos on social media. This is 'free advertising' for the brand. A disadvantage of this is the brand has no control over what message or image the celebrity associated with the brand is portraying.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Magnini | first1 = V. P. | year = 2011 | title = The implications of company-sponsored messages disguised as word-of-mouth | url = | journal = The Journal of Services Marketing | volume = 25 | issue = 4| pages = 243–251 | doi = 10.1108/08876041111143078 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Celebrity endorser criteria ==
When companies are selecting a celebrity to endorse their brand, they must match a certain criteria that they wish for the brand to be associated with. The celebrity must fill the gap between the consumer and brand when one is present.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; 
* Audience: The celebrity must be able to connect and reach the audience the brand is most compatible with.
* Characteristics: Must fit the brands characteristics so that they associate the right values with the brand.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Malik | first1 = A. | last2 = Sudhakar | first2 = B. D. | year = 2014 | title = Brand positioning through celebrity endorsement - A review contribution to brand literature | url = | journal = International Review of Management and Marketing | volume = 4 | issue = 4| pages = 259–275 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Image: Brands must look and see if the celebrities image is one the brand wants to be associated with, making sure they look into the celebrities image and past in case it could put the company into a bad light. If the celebrity has a negative image, the brand could be perceived that way too.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Yang | first1 = D. | last2 = Lo | first2 = J. | last3 = Wang | first3 = S. | year = 2012 | title = TRANSFER EFFECTS: EXPLORING THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CELEBRITY AND BRAND | url = | journal = International Journal of Organizational Innovation (Online) | volume = 4 | issue = 4| pages = 86–108 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  
* Attractiveness: A positive attitude is associated with attractive people. The more attractive a celebrity is, the more effective the endorsement will be.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;Gupta, R. Kishore N. Verma, DPS. IMPACT OF CELEBRITY ENDORSEMENTS ON CONSUMERS' PURCHASE INTENTION: (2015). ''Australian Journal of Business and Management Research, 5''(3), 1-n/a.&lt;/ref&gt; They look at the physical attributes the celebrity has such as body shape, facial features, and nationality.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Abdussalam | first1 = P. K. | year = 2014 | title = CELEBRITY ADVERTISEMENT: KEY TO MARKETING SUCCESS | url = | journal = Indian Journal of Commerce and Management Studies | volume = 5 | issue = 1| pages = 78–82 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Cost: Some celebrities can cost more than others due to popularity. The amount the celebrity costs to have endorsed a product or service can influence whether they are selected or not.
* Credibility: The credibility of the celebrity will transfer onto the brand so they must ensure the celebrity has a credible reputation.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Spry | first1 = A. | last2 = Pappu | first2 = R. | last3 = Cornwell | first3 = T. B. | year = 2011 | title = Celebrity endorsement, brand credibility and brand equity | url = | journal = European Journal of Marketing | volume = 45 | issue = 6| pages = 882–909 | doi = 10.1108/03090561111119958 }}&lt;/ref&gt; If a celebrity is already endorsing other brands or has endorsed a lot of brands in the past, this can have a negative effect on the brand image as consumers could believe that they are only doing it for the money and their credibility could come into question on whether the product is actually as good as what they are saying, creating the brands credibility to come into question also.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

== Advantages vs. disadvantages for brands&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; ==

=== Advantages ===

* Instant brand awareness: People will begin seeing, and associating the celebrity with the brand meaning the brand is more recognizable, building stronger brand awareness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Popescu | first1 = G. H. | year = 2014 | title = THE ECONOMIC VALUE OF CELEBRITY ENDORSEMENTS: A LITERATURE REVIEW | url = | journal = Economics, Management and Financial Markets | volume = 9 | issue = 4| pages = 119–124 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Personality Transfer: Using celebrity branding, can create a personality transfer where the brand inherits the personality of the celebrity. This can be an advantage if the celebrity has a positive reputation as the brand gains the attributes of the celebrity.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;
* Define and refresh brand image: The celebrity's attributes help to create the brands attributes, and can also refresh a brands image so that people know exactly what the brand stands for. Some brands also use it to re brand as their image as before it might not have had a strong brand image that saw it in a positive light.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dwivedi | first1 = A. | last2 = Mcdonald | first2 = R. E. | last3 = Johnson | first3 = L. W. | year = 2014 | title = The impact of a celebrity endorser's credibility on consumer self-brand connection and brand evaluation | url = | journal = Journal of Brand Management | volume = 21 | issue = 7-8| pages = 559–578 | doi = 10.1057/bm.2014.37 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* New consumers: When a celebrity endorses a brand, they often bring their followers along too, creating new consumers for the brand as they can reach a new market. The celebrity appeals to their consumers, which then can become the brands consumers, as they want to try what their celebrity is endorsing.
* Influences consumer purchases: New consumers arise as they follow the celebrity. This creates the outlook that if the celebrity thinks the product is great, then they should try it too. They desire to be like the celebrity, which influences the sale.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;
* Brand Positioning: Using a celebrity can help position the brand or product in the mind of the target market become a positive connection. This can increase the brand position over other brands.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;
* Lasting Publicity: Even after the endorsement deal is over, consumers will still associate the brand with the celebrity. Brands will gain that connection with the consumers without needing the celebrity as a current endorser.

=== Disadvantages ===

* Image change: Since the brand is being associated with a celebrity, everything they do will be associated with the brand. A bad celebrity image change, changes the brands image and can cause a drop in popularity, losing consumers and credibility of the brand.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;  An example of this was Maria Sharapova being dropped by three of her major sponsors such as Nike, after failing a drug test at the 2016 Australian Open. Celebrities can make mistakes and the brand can choose to back their endorser or drop them to avoid their reputation being tarnished too.
* Loss of popularity: If a celebrity loses followers by becoming less popular, which could be done through negative actions the brand will also lose popularity with that market. The loyalty of the consumers to the brand will only stay if they are loyal to the celebrity.
* Overexposure: Celebrities credibility can suffer if they are endorsing too many brands or products, especially in similar fields. This makes consumers associate the celebrity with lots of brands, rather than one distinct one making their association with the brand not as strong and compelling.
* Overshadowing: By a celebrity endorsing the product, consumers can just be interested in the celebrity rather than following the brand.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; This means that they don't actually create a connection with the brand, as their attention is focused on the celebrity, overshadowing the initial product or brand.

== Advantages vs. disadvantages for celebrity  ==
Celebrity endorsement also affects the celebrity. The brand itself can have a positive and negative influence on the celebrities' image showing a reverse effect of the celebrity endorsing the brand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Seno | first1 = D. | last2 = Lukas | first2 = B. A. | year = 2007 | title = The equity effect of product endorsement by celebrities | url = | journal = European Journal of Marketing | volume = 41 | issue = 1| pages = 121–134 | doi = 10.1108/03090560710718148 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Advantages ===

* Positive image: If the celebrity becomes an endorser for a company with a positive image, the celebrity can gain the same reputation of the brand they are associated with. This could be if they join with a brand who is environmentally friendly, the celebrity can be seen to be environmentally friendly also.
* Income: Brands will pay a huge amount for celebrities to endorse their product or service. This means celebrities gain more income for just associating them with the brand.
* Fame: Celebrities can also gain a bigger following from the brands consumers. They think that if the celebrity likes a brand they do, that they should like the celebrity too.

=== Disadvantages ===

* Lose credibility: If the brand does something deemed unacceptable by consumers, the celebrity can also be seen in this light. This could cause followers of the celebrity to be doubtful of them, not just the brand. Assumptions could be made that the celebrity agrees with all actions of the brand and become less credible by association.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;
* Put off other endorsements: By celebrities endorsing one brand, they could put off other brands offering them endorsement deals meaning they could miss out on more money or getting a deal with a brand they like more. They could also be seen as disliking other competitor brands or not able to associate themselves with other brands such as Nike and Adidas, as they in the same market.

== Importance ==
Celebrity branding has become a marketing strategy to help appeal a brand to new consumers. They are a way for brands to increase their sales and grow their market, having a huge influence on society as they are seen as opinion leaders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Chan | first1 = K. K. | last2 = Misra | first2 = S. | year = 1990 | title = Characteristics of the opinion leader: A new dimension | url = | journal = Journal of Advertising | volume = 19 | issue = 3| pages = 53–60 | doi=10.1080/00913367.1990.10673192}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brands build a relationship with new consumers through celebrities endorsing their products. Celebrities can capture the consumer's attention and identify with the brand, leading to sales and making the brand more desirable over other competitors. They also have an influence over their followers due to consumers showing an increase in obsession with celebrities'.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;  A connection can be made with the consumers in a way brands cannot. Some generations look up to celebrities as they can aspire to be like them. Many brands will ride the celebrity's success wave when using them in an endorsement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lazarevic | first1 = V | year = 2012 | title = Encouraging brand loyalty in fickle generation Y consumers | url = | journal = Young Consumers | volume = 13 | issue = 1| pages = 45–61 | doi = 10.1108/17473611211203939 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is important for a brand to choose their celebrity endorser carefully after considering factors, such as who fits the brand's image and what kind of message the brand wants to get across to the audience.&lt;ref&gt;Bearne, S. (2015). Because they're worth it? The power of a celebrity brand ambassador. Retrieved March 26, 2016, from https://www.theguardian.com/small-business-network/2015/jun/05/celebrity-brand-ambassador-business&lt;/ref&gt; It is also important for the celebrity endorser to be attractive, credible, and trustworthy as the image of the celebrity enhances advertising effectiveness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Eisend | first1 = M. | last2 = Langner | first2 = T. | year = 2010 | title = Immediate and delayed advertising effects of celebrity endorsers' attractiveness and expertise | url = | journal = International Journal of Advertising | volume = 29 | issue = 4| pages = 527–546 | doi=10.2501/s0265048710201336}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A report by [[Brand Affinity Technologies]] (BAT), a celebrity marketing company, discusses the effectiveness of celebrity endorsement in social media advertising. In 2011, BAT analyzed 200 social media endorsements against comparable social media advertisements that did not feature any celebrities and found that endorsed messages gave performance rates huge lifts: the results showed that 50% improvement was made in [[Cost per action|cost-per-action]] for endorsed messages over non-endorsed advertising, and the [[Click-through rate|click-through-rate]]s for endorsed messages were 17~21 times higher.&lt;ref&gt;Kinnear, K., &amp; Yelin, H. (2012). Celebrity endorsement: Socialize the endorsement. ''Admap''. 26-28&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Match-up hypothesis ===
The match-up hypothesis generally suggests that the image of the product or the brand that is being endorsed by the celebrity should match the image of the celebrity to make an effective advertisement.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kamins | first1 = M. A. | year = 1990 | title = An Investigation into the "Match-Up" Hypothesis in Celebrity Advertising: When Beauty May be Only Skin Deep | url = | journal = Journal of Advertising | volume = 19 | issue = 1| pages = 4–13 | doi=10.1080/00913367.1990.10673175}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Till | first1 = B. | last2 = Busler | first2 = M. | year = 2000 | title = The Match-Up Hypothesis: Physical Attractiveness, Expertise, and the Role of Fit on Brand Attitude, Purchase Intent and Brand Beliefs | url = | journal = Journal of Advertising | volume = 29 | issue = 3| pages = 1–13 | doi=10.1080/00913367.2000.10673613}}&lt;/ref&gt; The match-up hypothesis is only relevant when the product or the brand that is being advertised is related to a product that enhances one's attractiveness.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Thus, it is not only important that the images of the product and the celebrity matches, but the importance of the need for the two images to match on an attractive basis is emphasized.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

=== Example one (touchpoints) ===
The [[All Blacks]] partnership with [[Adidas]] is again an accurate example. It is always made apparent that the All Blacks are wearing Adidas in any form of media they appear in. Adidas benefits from its alliance with the All Blacks because of the All Black's high reputation and the fact that they use only the best equipment. The All Blacks are constantly followed on every form of media. This concludes the reason as to why Adidas is their main sponsor – they want to be a part of the 'All Blacks' fame and success.

Consumers decipher the cultural codes embodied in celebrity images and actively identify personal, social and cultural meaning in these idols. Therefore, this is why celebrity branding and endorsing through technology has become increasingly more of a trend with initial touch points of communicational advertising. More and more corporate brands are enlisting celebrities to differentiate their brand and create a more competitive advantage through media (IIicic &amp; M. Webster, 2015).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = IIicic | first1 = J. | last2 = Webster | first2 = C. | year = 2015 | title = Consumer Values of corporate and celebrity brand associations | url = http://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/full/10.1108/QMR-06-2013-0037 | journal = Qualitative Market Research: An International Journal | volume = 18 | issue = 2| pages = 164–187 | doi=10.1108/QMR-06-2013-0037}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, if there are two brands that have a similar or identical product, it is almost guaranteed that the brand with the more established and well-known celebrity will be more successful in sales and interest (Ambroise, Pantin-Sohler, Valette – Florence &amp; Albert, 2014&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;). Big companies such as Adidas and Nike use high-profile celebrities to appeal to the emotional side of the average consumer. Celebrities provide much more than entertainment. They influence consumers' perceptions, behaviours, values and decisions (Choi and Rifon, 2012).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Choi | first1 = S.M. | last2 = Rifon | first2 = N.J. | year = 2012 | title = It is a match: the impact of congruence between celebrity image and consumer ideal self on endorsement effectiveness | url = | journal = Psychology &amp; Marketing | volume = 29 | issue = 9| pages = 639–650 | doi=10.1002/mar.20550}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Celebrity branding has become a necessary tool for promoting and communicating brands. Whereas once there were only the three traditional methods, they are  no longer utilized as much. Due to all of the new intrusive and personal forms of media, celebrities' lives have become more transparent to the public, making them seem as if their lifestyles are more attainable. Touchpoints are one of important reasons for this. Celebrities are therefore viewed as an honest and reliable source of information as people assume they are using what is being endorsed. The social meanings within a celebrity branding are the attributes of the celebrity's individuality and the values of society (Turner, 2014).&lt;ref&gt;Turner, G. (2014), ''Understanding Celebrity'' , 2nd ed., Sage, London.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Celebrity Endorsement Vs Influencer marketing | url = http://www.theimpulsedigital.com/blog/celebrities-vs-influencers-marketing/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Celebrity entrepreneurial branding ==
Celebrity entrepreneurial branding refers to when a celebrity associates themselves as a financial stakeholder and/or decision maker of a product line (Muda et al., 2014). There are three types of involvement that a celebrity can have with the branding of a product line, these are mono-branding, co-branded celebrity products and noncelebrity-branded products (Keel &amp; Nataraajan, 2012).&lt;ref name=":20" /&gt; Clothing and fragrances are the most common types of product lines (Patra &amp; Datta, 2010&lt;ref name=":23"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Patra|first1=S|last2=Datta|first2=K|title=Celebrity endorsement in India: Emerging trends and challenges|journal=Journal of Marketing &amp; Communication|date=2012|volume=5|issue=3|pages=16–23}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

=== Mono-branding ===
Mono-branding refers to when a product carries only the name of the Celebrity and the manufacturer does not directly associate itself with the product (Keel &amp; Nataraajan, 2012&lt;ref name=":20" /&gt;). Keel and Nataraajan (2012) state that mono-branding is commonly used to expand the customer base, or to extend the brands.&lt;ref name=":20" /&gt; An example of this, is the collaboration between manufacturer Elizabeth Arden and Britney Spears who created the Britney Spears fragrance line (Keel &amp; Nataraajan, 2012&lt;ref name=":20" /&gt;).

=== Co-branded celebrity products ===
Co-branded celebrity products refers to a strategic alliance between two brands, to develop, produce and market a product, whilst all parties retain their name (Keel &amp; Nataraajan, 2012&lt;ref name=":20" /&gt;). Oeppen and Jamal&lt;ref name=":24"&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Jamal|first2=A|date=2014|title=Collaborating for success: managerial perspectives on co-branding strategies in the fashion industry|journal=Journal of Marketing Management|volume=30|issue=9-10|pages=925–948|doi=10.1080/0267257x.2014.934905|last1=Oeppen|first1=J}}&lt;/ref&gt; (2014) state there are three levels of co-branding: reach/awareness co-branding, value endorsement co-branding and value awareness co-branding. Reach/awareness co-branding is the lowest level and its purpose is to maximize brand awareness (Oeppen, &amp; Jamal, 2014&lt;ref name=":24" /&gt;). On the second level is value endorsement co-branding which aims to align either both or one of the brand's values in the consumers mind (Oeppen, &amp; Jamal, 2014&lt;ref name=":24" /&gt;). Finally, ingredient co-branding. This level of co-brandings aims to create higher value creation by using the product of a market leading brand "as a component of another brand" (Oeppen, &amp; Jamal, 2014&lt;ref name=":24" /&gt;). Co-branded celebrity products is commonly used in order to create greater value, expand customer base and increase brand awareness for both brands involved (Keel &amp; Nataraajan, 2012&lt;ref name=":20" /&gt;). An example of a co-branded celebrity product is the collaboration between Taylor Swift and Keds footwear who in 2012 released a range of shoes called the Taylor Swift for Keds Collection (Kreller &amp; Sabatelle,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kreller|first1=E|last2=Sabatelle|first2=A|title=Keds announces first footwear collaboration with Taylor Swift|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/keds-introduces-first-footwear-collaboration-with-taylor-swift-201038411.html|accessdate=2016-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; 2013).

=== Noncelebrity-branded products ===
Noncelebrity-branded products are products that are not branded with the manufacturer or the celebrity's name (Keel &amp; Nataraajan, 2012&lt;ref name=":20" /&gt;). Keel and Nataraajan (2012&lt;ref name=":20" /&gt;) state that this method of celebrity branding is commonly used when the endorsing celebrity has a 'narrow audience', is of limited appeal to the wider market, or the celebrity-product relationship is not a perfect fit. The product or brand may have better success or broader appeal if it is not directly associated with the celebrity entrepreneurial endorser. This is largely common in the food industry, with many celebrities opening restaurants for example Arnold Schwarzenegger opened Schatzi, an Austrian restaurant. An example of this in an alternative industry is the clothing line 6126, which was founded by Lindsay Lohan (Keel &amp; Nataraajan, 2012&lt;ref name=":20" /&gt;).

== Famous musicians collaborating with designer brands ==
Society at large has embraced the fashion choices of numerous musicians, and collaboration of famous musicians and designer brands is not exclusive to the 21st century. For instance, Nirvana's lead-man, Kurt Cobain, represented 90's grunge fashion while rapper Tupac Shukar was a symbol for 90's hip hop fashion. When hip hop music sales increased throughout the 1980s and 1990s, many apparel manufacturers wanted to capitalize on the trend. Karl Kani, a clothing brand centered around urban hip hop culture, attributed most of its success to the likes of Tupac and Mos Def wearing its apparel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=John|first1=Elena Romero ; foreword by Daymond|title=Free stylin' : how hip hop changed the fashion industry|date=2012|publisher=Praeger|location=Santa Barbara, Calif.|isbn=9780313386466}}&lt;/ref&gt; Music and fashion continue to intersect today due to the trend of celebrity musicians collaborating with designer brands. According to the ''Journal of Marketing Management'', celebrity endorsement can be effective because consumers believe in the celebrity figures and consequently support the brands that the endorser markets. Evaluation of celebrity branding also suggests that credible advertising messages, coupled with the right endorser, can build consumer loyalty for the brand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Davies; Slater|first1=Fiona; Stephanie|title=Unpacking celebrity brands through unpaid market communications|journal=Journal of Marketing Management|date=23 January 2015|volume=31|issue=5-6|doi=10.1080/0267257X.2014.1000941|url=https://www-tandfonline-com.ezproxy.neu.edu/doi/pdf/10.1080/0267257X.2014.1000941?needAccess=true|accessdate=21 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Companies today often work with famous musicians to reap various benefits for their business such as increasing brand awareness. Singer and songwriter, Lana Del Rey, collaborated with H&amp;M, and a study found that the posts containing Del Rey on the Facebook brand page received more likes than their regular posts, averaging out to around 667,000 likes per post.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Buzz vs. Sales: Big Social Data Analytics of Style Icon Campaigns and Fashion Designer Collaborations on H&amp;M’s Facebook Page|url=https://aisel.aisnet.org/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1252&amp;context=hicss-50|accessdate=21 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the past couple of years, many other well-known musicians have started their own capsule collections with designer brands.

=== FENTY PUMA by Rihanna ===
In December 2014, Grammy award-winning artist, Rihanna became a brand ambassador and creative director of the fashion sportswear brand PUMA. In this role, Rihanna oversaw the brand's women's line which included collaborations in apparel, footwear, and accessories. In 2015, Rihanna released her first footwear collaboration with PUMA, the Creeper, which sold out within three hours of its pre-sale launch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Adamczyk|first1=Alicia|title=Rihanna Named Creative Director of PUMA|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/aliciaadamczyk/2014/12/16/rihanna-named-creative-director-of-puma/#71eb716e367f|website=Forbes.com|accessdate= 24 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the success, Rihanna and PUMA teamed up to create her very first fashion line named after her last name: FENTY PUMA by Rihanna. Each of the collection's seasons has introduced a different concept visually. The first season that dropped had roots in goth-streetwear culture, the 2017 spring/summer collection was French-inspired and described by Rihanna as, "If Marie Antoinette was going to the gym and needed something to wear." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cusumano|first1=Katherine|title=For Puma x Fenty, Rihanna Presents Gym Gear for Marie Antoinette, Who Didn't Really Go to the Gym|url=https://www.wmagazine.com/story/rihanna-puma-x-fenty-spring-2017-marie-antoinette|website=WMagazine.com|accessdate= 24 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the 2018 autumn/winter drop features a collection influenced by different cliques of high school. The apparel pieces features elements like exaggerated block letters and preppy silhouettes all designed by the help of the singer herself. In an interview with Vogue, Rihanna said, "I have never gotten the chance to dress up in school. I always had to wear a school uniform...making this collection, I was able to have a little fun and play and create." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fenty x Puma|url=https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/fall-2017-ready-to-wear/fenty-puma|website=Vogue.com|accessdate= 24 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rihanna's last collection with PUMA dropped on March 15, 2018 fusing race culture and beach wear. According to Rihanna, making this collection "was definitely a challenge" but she "really wanted to make something that was completely different" than anything she's ever done before with PUMA. The introduction of Rihanna's line has not only been praised by critics and fashion bloggers, but has brought the company great success. Since the collaboration with the musician, PUMA has seen a 183% increase in searches on their site and Rihanna's velvet Creepers won Shoe of the Year Award in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bergstein|first1=Rachelle|title=Fashion E-Commerce Site Lyst Reveals Its Top-Searched Shoes Of The Year|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/rachellebergstein/2016/12/08/fashion-e-commerce-site-lyst-reveals-its-top-searched-shoes-of-the-year/#62d3d6bedd86|website=Forbes.com|accessdate= 24 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== GUESS x A$AP Rocky ===
In 2016, GUESS collaborated with rapper, A$AP Rocky, on a capsule collection featuring a line of apparel and accessories for both men and women. Because A$AP Rocky is a prominent rapper who has also been known for his style and interest in the fashion industry, the Los Angeles native brand, GUESS, paired up with him to release a 90's hip-hop throwback collection with a modern spin. Referring to the initial concept of the collaboration, Rocky said, "It was just all about doing this whole throwback thing and bringing back Guess and just showing its importance in hip hop. Let’s be real, Guess was the s**t for hip hop." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Baltin|first1=Steve|title=ASAP Rocky Teams With Guess For Fantastical Los Angeles Pop-Up Shop|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevebaltin/2017/03/10/asap-rocky-teams-with-guess-for-fantastical-l-a-pop-up-shop/#c107a4138206|website=Forbes.com|accessdate=17 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The line of apparel features iconic GUESS pieces like the triangle logo, colorful stripes, and distressed denim jackets with a redesigned version of the GUESS logo on the back. Most of the pieces in the collection replace the original "s" in "GUESS" with embroidered dollar signs in order to represent the rapper's insignia. According to Rocky, the line was also meant to feel nostalgic “I just wanted to bring back that feeling for our generation. There’s so much that they don’t know about, even with access to the Internet. I have a platform, so I’m just trying to show kids what they missed out on. They don’t know about the ‘80s and early ‘90s.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wete|first1=Brad|title=A$AP Rocky's Clubhouse Opens With Frank Ocean, Kendall Jenner &amp; More As Guests|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/lifestyle/7718234/asap-rocky-guess-clubhouse-open|website=Billboard.com|accessdate=17 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the summer of 2017, the rapper and GUESS hosted pop up shops in New York City and West Hollywood where celebrities and fans attended to get the first chance to purchase something from the collection. Despite the buzz from his collaboration with GUESS, the company still reported a loss of $21.3 million in its fiscal first quarter as of May 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Guess Reports First-Quarter Loss|url=https://www.businessoffashion.com/articles/news-analysis/guess-reports-first-quarter-loss|website=Business of Fashion|publisher=Associated Press|accessdate=17 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fred Perry x Amy Winehouse Foundation ===
Fred Perry is a British clothing brand founded in 1952 by triple Wimbledon champion, Fred Perry. The brand is known for its expensive yet casual wear, cashmere polos, sport-inspired wear, and involvement in mod culture. In 2010, the brand collaborated with the late British singer, Amy Winehouse to release a 50's and 60's inspired collection all designed by Winehouse herself. Richard Martin, former marketing director for Fred Perry, said the brand chose to collaborate with Winehouse because they "were aware she was a genuine fan of the brand" and because "Amy has a unique sense of style that reflects the brand's own historical reference points." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Milligan|first1=Lauren|title=Winehouse Wears|url=http://www.vogue.co.uk/article/amy-winehouse-for-fred-perry|website=Vouge.com|accessdate=23 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the collection Winehouse was inspired by her own retro wardrobe and said, "I still dress like I am in the 50's." The line varies in its product assortment, featuring plaid shirts and rompers, vintage sweaters, and polos with embroidery replicating the singer's own tattoo designs. The singer was only alive during the first drop of her collaboration which featured pieces like an argyle longline sweater that she was often seen wearing in the public, as well as during her recording session with Tony Bennett. After Amy Winehouse passed away on July 23, 2011, Fred Perry eventually received permission from her family to continue to release the rest of the collection over the next couple of years. Mitch Winehouse, the singer's father said, "When Fred Perry came to us to ask what we would like to do with the new collection, it was natural to continue. Amy loved working on both collections and would want them to be made available." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Nicholls|first1=Owen|title=Fred Perry releases Amy Winehouse collection|url=http://www.nme.com/news/music/amy-winehouse-143-1273213|website=NME.com|accessdate=17 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The singer's collection with Fred Perry is still available for sale online, but some of the new pieces are not based on original designs by Ms. Winehouse. Instead, her tattoo artist, Henry Hate and the Fred Perry design team have collaborated to continue working on the collection. Since the new collaboration, all sales from the collection's Fall 2011 and Spring 2012 pieces were donated to the Amy Winehouse Foundation. The Amy Winehouse Foundation was started by the singer's parents after she passed away, and mainly aims to prevent the effects of drug and alcohol misuse on young people. Fred Perry continues to make seasonal donations to the Amy Winehouse Foundation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Nika|first1=Colleen|title=A Look At Amy Winehouse's Final Collection for Fred Perry|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/news/a-look-at-amy-winehouses-final-collection-for-fred-perry-20120131|website=Rolling Stone|accessdate=17 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In today's world ==

In modern-day{{when|date=March 2018}} many businesses have chosen to use celebrities in their marketing communications to make their product or organisation seem appealing to consumers, this type of strategy is used to increase sales and help the business seem more popular than other competitors. By using many known celebrities to be the face of their business campaign this puts a high emplacement of the brand in the consumers mind and helps shows trustworthiness, expertise and attractiveness by the use of the celebrity (Escalas &amp; Bettman, 2015, p. xx). By using celebrities it not only makes the consumer feel attracted to the product it also maintains attention and keeps a higher recall about the business in their minds due to their fame in today's modern environment. Many businesses around the world are flooded with competitors so turn to celebrity branding to appeal to their targeted consumers, due to celebrities being seen as role models this will trigger a sense of need and satisfaction to the product in the consumers mind and will make them be able to related more to the business.{{More citations needed|date=February 2015}}

== Relating to marketing and advertising ==

Celebrity branding is crucial in the delivery of a message from the communicators to the audience. These celebrities are often referred to as [[opinion leader]]s or OLs. An opinion leader is a well-known individual or group that is used to help influence an opinion on a certain subject or matter due to their perceived social standing. Not to be confused with an opinion former, who is someone who holds professional expertise due to previous study and/or employment and is known to be knowledgeable within the field.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Marketing communications: A brand narrative approach|last=Dahlen|first=M|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|year=2010|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These celebrities or OL's will communicate to the audience through socially mediated communications that enable the audience themselves to create a meaning through their own interactions. Examples of outlets include magazines, billboards, television ads, social media promotion and promotional events.

Opinion leaders are the first step in the elements of persuasion. This is most important to the pre-purchase experience when a consumer is most interested in the marketing of the product they are intending to buy. The power of the persuasion that the opinion leader possesses will change depending on many different factors. The first is their credibility, this also works in turn with perceived trustworthiness. Consumers are more likely to believe that the campaign is genuine if the opinion leader is someone who has a reputation for being honest and credible. Another factor is their expertise in that field, although they don't have to be at an opinion formers level of expertise, any previous actions, study or jobs that may help the consumer believe that they do know a little bit about what they are promoting, also helps with the authenticity of the advert. For some, the more superficial values hold the most weight in persuasion so the mere fact that the OL is attractive is a key for them, also their social standing not only effects the reach of promotion, but also can attribute to the persuasiveness. People who are the most effected by opinion leaders are those who are often engaged under the peripheral route. The peripheral route is less analytical of the actual product at hand, but will be persuaded due to other factors including an opinion leader that the consumer likes, or attractive elements of the packaging. Whereas those who undertake the central route of persuasion are less affected by these often superficial features and are more likely to choose an option based on the merits of the products or the strength of the argument.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Attitudes and  persuasion:  Classic and contemporary approaches|last=Petty|first=R|publisher=Wm. C. Brown Company Publishers|year=1981|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of opinion leaders in the social media touch point is the uprising in tourism campaigns running that will fully fund an Instagram opinion leaders travel to their country to 'gram' the whole experience. These opinion leaders are people with a large number of followers (think hundreds of thousands), and a strong influence within in Instagram community. The photos are of a real experience, so is perceived as very authentic and a real experience. This will be more persuasive in convincing people to travel to the particular country as they want to see the monument, beach, or other landmark that they have seen on Instagram.

Opinion leaders help businesses overcome a key problem in today's marketing context that is to cut through the clutter. The average consumer 20 years ago was exposed to up to 2,000 adverts a day, while in today's modern marketing platform consumers can be exposed to anywhere up to 5,000 adverts in a 24-hour period.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/15/business/media/15everywhere.html|title=Anywhere the Eye Can See, It's Likely to See an Ad|last=Story|first=Louise|date=2007-01-15|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the many different and new advertising outlets used in today's world and the large number of adverts present, one of the biggest struggle for a company is to stand out and differentiate themselves as not all of those 5,000 ads will be memorable, let alone noticeable.

== Communication through celebrity branding ==
Communication has been variously defined as the passing of information, between a sender and a receiver (Belch, G. E., &amp; Belch, M. A, 2012)&lt;ref name=":25"&gt;[https://autonline.aut.ac.nz/bbcswebdav/pid-3617613-dt-content-rid-6696859_3/xid-6696859_3 Belch, G. E., &amp; Belch, M. A. (2012). ''Advertising and promotion: An integrated marketing communications perspective'' (9th ed.). New York, NY: McGraw-Hill Irwin.]{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}
&lt;/ref&gt; representing the reasoning behind why celebrity endorsements of brands are so successful in this day and age. This suggests that for communication to occur, there must be some common thinking between two parties and information must be passed from one person to another (or from one group to another) (Belch, G. E., &amp; Belch, M. A, 2012).&lt;ref name=":25"/&gt; Celebrities are now a common factor within people's daily lives – whether we like it or not we live in a world that has been socially influenced by celebrities.

This is exactly why celebrity endorsed products are so successful.

Media in the past 10 years has changed dramatically. Society as a whole has been completely reconstructed with the advancements in technology. Different models of communication are now used universally – Twitter, Facebook, Instagram etc. – alongside many other traditional media (radio, print and television etc.) Technology through social media now runs the show. As observed technology is rapidly adapting, meaning communication through celebrity branding must also be updated regularly.

Models of communication are always present when marketing a product. Especially when it comes to celebrities endorsing products.

=== Link with communication ===
The link between communication and celebrity branding is that there has to be good communication and understanding between the product/company and the celebrity supporting the good. Therefore, there cannot be a bad effect due to the celebrity portraying the brand or product incorrectly because of a miscommunication and causing conflict, frustration or tension (Sabie and Androniceanu, 2012).

The celebrity endorser needs to use persuasive communication to intrigue an audience into the brand's product or service. The celebrity endorser influencing a consumer's intentions, beliefs, attitudes, motivations and behavior in connecting with the brand's product or service can do this. This type of communication can encourage a consumer's decision in purchasing the product/service.

=== Models of communication ===
* Source Encoding
* Buzz Marketing
* Receiver Decoding

'''Models of communication source encoding'''

Source encoding is relevant often in celebrity branding. The sender, or source, of a communication is the person or organization that has information to share with another person or group of people. This is generally a hired spokesman, such as a celebrity, who appears in a company's advertisements (Belch, G. E., &amp; Belch, M. A, 2012).&lt;ref name=":25"/&gt; Brands must ensure that they carefully choose with whom they decide to endorse their brand, as this will be the first touch point the consumer encounters and they will be communicating the brand as well as endorsing it. Because the receiver's perceptions of the source influence how the communication of the brand is received, marketers must be very careful to pick a communicator the receiver believes is knowledgeable and trustworthy. They need to be someone who they can identify and relate the product to (Belch, G. E., &amp; Belch, M. A, 2012). However, sometimes this method of communication can backfire on a brand. This can be the result of a public figure acting out of place and they are therefor viewed badly which results in the brand being viewed negatively also.

'''Example one'''

Nike unfortunately has had to learn this the hard way – with professional sports stars having a tendency to be viewed by the media negatively. Tiger Woods was the perfect example of an accurate fit for Nike golf apparel. However, as soon as the public became aware of his 'marriage issues' Nike dropped his contract for fear that people might may no longer want to buy their products. Nike knew that bad publicity would have been counterproductive on the sale of their products. Tiger Woods' fall from grace would reverberate against the wholesome image, which Nike wanted to project. Because of the advancement of social media, celebrity endorsement can be a double-edged sword. When the celebrity is at the height of popularity endorsement works well for both parties. However, when the celebrity falls from grace then the use of the celebrity is non productive – the effects are almost immediate.

'''Example two'''

A more recent example is that of Maria Sharapova, world tennis champion and highest paid female athlete, who failed a drug test at the Australian open in January 2016. She admitted the charge and the brands she was endorsing withdrew their sponsorships – Nike, TAG Heuer and Porsche (Harris &amp; Murray Brown, 2016).&lt;ref&gt;Harris, B., &amp; Murray Brown, J. (2016). ''Nike and TAG Heuer ditch Maria Sharapova after failed drugs test - FT.com''. ''Financial Times''. Retrieved 27 March 2016, from http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/b85d6752-e4e6-11e5-a09b-1f8b0d268c39.html#axzz443xcilOx&lt;/ref&gt; Nike alone has cancelled many deals with sports stars including Oscar Pistorious, Manny Pacquiao, Lance Armstrong and Ray Rice. (Harris &amp; Murray Brown, 2016)

However successful endorsements are more common than not, for example that of George Clooney promoting Nespresso coffee. Nespresso lures international clients with 'A list' celebrity's status such as George Clooney. Because of his wide-ranging appeal and worldly charismatic identity, people see the product as highly desirable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wheepr.com/charming-nespresso-ads-come-to-america-devito-joins-clooney/|title=Charming Nespresso Ads Come To America DeVito Joins Clooney|work=WheePR}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Channel-buzz marketing ===
The channel is the method by which the communication travels from the source or sender to the receiver (Belch, G. E., &amp; Belch, M. A, 2012).&lt;ref name=":25"/&gt; [[Buzz marketing]] comes under the channel method and is another way in which celebrities can create a 'buzz marketing' effect and get people talking about a product. Many marketers are focusing on creating viral buzz to spread the word about their brand by using online techniques (Belch, G. E., &amp; Belch, M. A, 2012).&lt;ref name=":25"/&gt; Celebrities best do this as they have wide followings in the 'online world'. Celebrities create a buzz when they promote a new trend or current craze. The public listen, as they can now learn a lot more about celebrities as they follow their daily movements on social media. The public eye can gain an insight into the public figure's attitudes, values and beliefs with a simple click or tap of a screen. The public eye then mimics the actions, preference and lifestyles of their favourite celebrities. This is how the method of 'Buzz Marketing' works so well and is the reasoning behind why big corporations compete against one another to sign contracts with these public figures – they want to create the first 'buzz' in the market. "Personally relevant meanings derived from celebrity and brand associations are important as they influence consumer motivation, preference and choice (Gutman, 1982)&lt;ref name=":25"/&gt; Creating a buzz is so important from a communicational marketing perspective as (Belch, G. E., &amp; Belch, M. A, 2012)&lt;ref name=":25"/&gt; it shows how valuable "pass-along" benefits are from consumers talking about a buzz created around a product (Belch, G. E., &amp; Belch, M. A., 2012).

'''Receiver decoding-decoding'''

''"Decoding is the process of transforming the sender's message back into thought"'' (Belch, G. E., &amp; Belch, M. A, 2012).&lt;ref name=":25"/&gt; This explains the reasoning again of why choosing the right celebrity to endorse a product is so crucial. It is important that the company can create the product also in relation to the celebrity as the celebrity is not only a spokesman/ face of the brand but they are also a consumer of the product. ''"Effective communication is more likely when there is some common ground between the two parties".'' (Belch, G. E., &amp; Belch, M. A, 2012).&lt;ref name=":25"/&gt; Because consumers ''humanize brands'' (Ambroise, Pantin-Sohler, Valette-Florence &amp; Albert, 2014)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ambroise | first1 = L. | last2 = Pantin-Sohler | first2 = G. | last3 = Valette-Florence | first3 = P. | last4 = Albert | first4 = N. | year = 2014 | title = From endorsement to celebrity co-branding: Personality transfer | url = | journal = Journal of Brand Management | volume = 21 | issue = 4| pages = 273–285 | doi=10.1057/bm.2014.7}}&lt;/ref&gt; the celebrity must fit with the brand. This highlights the importance of the match up between the celebrity's image and the brand's image (Batra and Homer, 2004).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Batra | first1 = R. | last2 = Homer | first2 = P.M. | year = 2004 | title = The situational impact of brand image beliefs | url = | journal = Journal of Consumer Psychology | volume = 14 | issue = 3| pages = 318–330 | doi=10.1207/s15327663jcp1403_12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Example one:'''
Kim Kardashian promotes a lot of weight loss products as people are interested in how she loses her post-baby weight. Kim Kardashian uses her current situations and then endorses from there (Solomon, 2015&lt;ref&gt;Solomon, K. (2015). ''How the digital revolution has changed marketing''. ''Telegraph.co.uk''. Retrieved 26 March 2016, from https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sponsored/education/online-learning-courses/11817140/how-marketing-has-changed.html
&lt;/ref&gt;). Kim Kardashian and her weight issues are constantly in the media. People are more likely to take notice of what she has to say as they believe that she has personal experience and is knowledgeable about the product and has been selected for that very reason.

'''Example two:'''
The All Blacks are a winning side, therefore representing 'Adidas' as a winning product. People young and old follow the All Blacks and are conscious of all things concerned with the All Blacks – they are respected and idolised. The brand's emotional involvement and its relationship with good values, sportsmanship and team morale all contribute to its overall image and success. "When brands establishing a relationship and connection to popular names in entertainment, sports, fashion, and other verticals, there is the potential to boost sales drastically, especially when the consumer believes the product or service is actually used by the celebrity him or herself" (Belch, G. E., &amp; Belch, M. A, 2012).&lt;ref name=":25"/&gt;  Wearing Adidas is obviously not going to make the consumer have the athletic ability of an All Black but the product is aligned with all the winning attributes of the All Black.

=== Touchpoints ===
Touchpoints are crucial to a brand when it comes to marketing and advertising their product/service. Any point of contact where a business engages with a customer to exchange information about their good/service is considered a touchpoint. It targets the chosen market by taking advantage of the most effective channels to appeal to and entice this group to communicate their intended message. Brands need to think of the most optimal ways to get the word out about their good and the information surrounding it. Different touchpoints allow the brand to appeal to their specific market in the most direct way possible, which considers the particular targeted groups needs and wants out of accessing and receiving information about a product (Straker, K., Wrigley, C., &amp; Rosemann, M. (2015)).&lt;ref&gt;Straker, K., Wrigley, C., &amp; Rosemann, M. (2015). Typologies and touchpoints: Designing multi-channel digital strategies. ''Journal of Research in Interactive Marketing, 9''(2), 110-128. Retrieved from http://search.proquest.com/docview/1683583274
&lt;/ref&gt;

In relation to celebrity branding, if a company decides they want to use a famous and well-known celebrity to endorse their campaign, they would need to carefully pick what touchpoints they use to convey their brand to their consumers.

Touchpoints are always evolving as the tastes and preferences of consumers are constantly changing and adapting to the technology and resources that are available. The traditional touchpoints that would have been relevant and effective in the 2000s could be greatly ineffective for marketing ten years later in the 2010s. The same as vital touchpoints marketers use now may have not existed a decade ago like all of the social media websites and apps. Traditional touchpoints began with radio, newspaper and television but now some of the most common touchpoints used in celebrity branding largely are through social media e.g. Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Tumblr and various other social media webpages. Now with the forever changing technology, people are ditching old touchpoints for newer and faster ones leading sources like newspapers to get printed less and less every year and TV marketing to be less effective as people now can skip past advertisements missing the endorsement and the message it was trying to convey. These new touchpoints are quicker, highly accessible and easy to use for the modern day person with their portable smartphone or computer – this has created celebrity endorsements to be incredibly popular on these sites through the celebrity posting a picture or status advertising the business and their products on their personal accounts. These social media sites give celebrity branding a significant boost and immense opportunities with millions of millions of accounts, creating an audience which is virtually endless (Bradic, 2015).&lt;ref name=":25"/&gt;

According to the 'source credibility model' (Hovland, Jannis, &amp; Kelley, 1953), much research and study collated on endorser effectiveness conclude "that a celebrity generally has a greater impact on attitude change and purchase intention than a non-celebrity spokesman" (Choi, S.A.M. and Rifon, N.J. (2012).)&lt;ref&gt;Choi, S.A.M. and Rifon, N.J. (2012), "It is a match: the impact of congruence between celebrity image and consumer ideal self on endorsement effectiveness", Psychology &amp; Marketing, Vol. 29 No. 9, pp. 639-650.&lt;/ref&gt; When people view these posts on the celebrity's personal social media account they therefore assume if the spokesman highly regards the good or service, this gains the consumers trust in the business and the purpose it serves.

To keep up with these changes, businesses who strategise using celebrity branding to advertise their campaigns will use the most obvious choice to reach their market. For example, if a brand is wanting to target the elderly it would make sense to put their celebrity marketing in radio or newspapers – though less used, still used by marketers to appeal to the tradition media users; whereas if they were targeting a younger market who are more social media and technology savvy then they would use websites like Instagram or Facebook to appeal to them and communicate their message.

'''Chad Edward Gaudin''' ({{IPAc-en|ɡ|oʊ|ˈ|d|æ|n}}; born March 24, 1983) is an American professional baseball [[pitcher]] for the [[Leones de Yucatán]] of the [[Mexican Baseball League]]. He has been used as both a [[starting pitcher]] and a [[relief pitcher|reliever]] throughout his career, functioning as a  "[[Glossary of baseball#swingman|swingman]]."

Gaudin has pitched in [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB) for the [[Tampa Bay Rays|Tampa Bay Devil Rays]], [[Toronto Blue Jays]], [[Oakland Athletics]], [[Chicago Cubs]], [[San Diego Padres]], [[New York Yankees]], [[Washington Nationals]], [[Miami Marlins]], and [[San Francisco Giants]].

==High school==
Gaudin attended Crescent City Baptist High School in [[Metairie, Louisiana]]. He earned All-State and district [[MVP]] in his junior and senior years.

==Professional career==
===Tampa Bay Devil Rays===
====Minor leagues====
Gaudin was selected by the [[Tampa Bay Rays|Tampa Bay Devil Rays]] out of high school in the 34th round (1009th overall pick) of the [[2001 Major League Baseball Draft]]. He signed on August 23, 2001, and did not play professionally until 2002. He played in Single-A in 2002 and recorded a 2.26 [[Earned run average|ERA]] which ranked him 10th in all of minor league baseball.

On July 15, 2003, in his first start after getting called up from the Single-A [[California League]], Gaudin took the mound in the first game of a [[Doubleheader (baseball)|doubleheader]] for the Double-A [[Orlando Rays]] on the road against the [[Jacksonville Suns]] and threw a 7-inning [[perfect game]], retiring all 21 batters he faced. (Two 7-inning games is the standard for a doubleheader in most minor leagues; Major League Baseball would later amend a rule recognizing only efforts of at least nine innings as official perfect games.) Gaudin made only two more starts and posted an 0.47 ERA for Orlando before Devil Rays' [[Manager (baseball)|Manager]] [[Lou Piniella]] summoned him to the big league club.

====Major leagues====
When Gaudin made his major league debut, he became the youngest Devil Ray in club history at 20 years and four months and was the 4th youngest player in the majors. He allowed one run in 2.1 innings in his debut on August 1, 2003, against the [[Kansas City Royals]].  After posting a very respectable 2–0 record and 3.60 ERA in 15 appearances (including 3 starts) in 2003 for the Devil Rays, he went 1–2 with a 4.85 ERA in 26 appearances (4 starts) in 2004 while splitting time with the [[Triple-A (baseball)|Triple-A]] [[Durham Bulls]].

===Toronto Blue Jays===
On December 12, 2004, Gaudin was traded to the [[Toronto Blue Jays]] for backup [[catcher]] [[Kevin Cash]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Minor-league pitcher goes to Toronto|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=1944972|accessdate=February 26, 2015|agency=Associated Press|publisher=ESPN.com|date=December 12, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although he pitched well as a starter at Triple-A [[Syracuse Chiefs|Syracuse]], he was just 1–3 with a 13.15 ERA in 5 appearances (3 starts) with the Blue Jays. Opponents had [[Batting average|batted]] .470 against him in just 13 innings (31 [[Hit (baseball)|hits]]).

===Oakland Athletics===
On December 5, 2005, he was traded to the [[Oakland Athletics]] for a [[player to be named later]], who later turned out to be outfielder [[Dustin Majewski]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=A's send minor league OF Dustin Majewski to Toronto|url=http://oakland.athletics.mlb.com/news/press_releases/press_release.jsp?ymd=20051208&amp;content_id=1279344&amp;vkey=pr_oak&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=oak|accessdate=February 26, 2015|publisher=MLB.com|date=December 8, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Gaudin2SEA.jpg|upright|thumb|left|Gaudin with the [[Oakland Athletics]] in 2006.]]
Gaudin began the 2006 season for the [[Sacramento River Cats]], the Athletics Triple-A team. He was recalled by the Athletics after posting an 0.36 ERA in 4 starts for the River Cats and pitched in [[Relief pitcher|relief]] for the rest of the season for the big league club. In his first season as an Athletic, he posted various career highs and his ERA (3.08) and opponents batting average were the lowest of his career. His inherited runners to score was 20 percent, which ranked fourth lowest in the [[American League]].

In 2007, Gaudin was converted into a starter again when veteran [[Esteban Loaiza]] was on the [[disabled list]] to begin the season. He pitched in a team high and career high 34 starts, posting career highs in wins (11), innings pitched (199.1), strikeouts (154) and walks (100). His excellent performance as a starter in the 2007 season made him part of the new 'Big Three' that included [[Dan Haren]] and [[Joe Blanton]].

In December 2007, Gaudin successfully had his [[sesamoid bone]] removed from the base of his big toe in a procedure called a sesamoidectomy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=A's RHP Chad Gaudin to undergo surgery |url=http://oakland.athletics.mlb.com/news/press_releases/press_release.jsp?ymd=20071215&amp;content_id=2327510&amp;vkey=pr_oak&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=oak |location= |publisher=MLB.com |agency= |date=December 15, 2007 |accessdate=June 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Haft|first1=Chris|title=Oakland signs Gaudin to one-year deal|url=http://oakland.athletics.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20080125&amp;content_id=2355803&amp;vkey=news_oak&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=oak|accessdate=June 25, 2014|publisher=MLB.com|date=January 25, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121024083502/http://oakland.athletics.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20080125&amp;content_id=2355803&amp;vkey=news_oak&amp;c_id=oak&amp;fext=.jsp#|archive-date=October 24, 2012|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was back on the mound pitching again within three months.

Gauding began the 2008 season in the rotation, appearing in 6 starts. On May 7, 2008, Gaudin was moved back into the bullpen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Mychael=\last=Urban|url=http://oakland.athletics.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20080507&amp;content_id=2656845&amp;vkey=news_oak&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=oak|title=The Official Site of The Oakland Athletics: News: Gaudin to 'pen to make room for Harden|publisher=Oakland.athletics.mlb.com|date=May 7, 2008|accessdate=2010-08-22|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120318031226/http://oakland.athletics.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20080507&amp;content_id=2656845&amp;vkey=news_oak&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=oak|archive-date=March 18, 2012|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; He went 5-3 in 26 games along with 6 starts for the A's before being traded.

===Chicago Cubs===
[[File:Chad Gaudin to the plate.jpg|upright|thumb|Gaudin with the [[Chicago Cubs]] in 2008.]]
On July 8, 2008, Gaudin was dealt along with [[Rich Harden]] to the [[Chicago Cubs]] in exchange for [[Sean Gallagher (baseball)|Sean Gallagher]], [[Matt Murton]], [[Eric Patterson]], and minor league catcher [[Josh Donaldson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Cubs trade four players to A's for pitchers Harden, Gaudin|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=3478902|accessdate=June 25, 2014|publisher=ESPN.com|date=July 8, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite posting a 4-2 record, Gaudin pitched poorly for the Cubs, posting an ERA over 6.00 after coming over from Oakland. Gaudin was released by the Cubs on April 5, 2009 after a disappointing second half.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Paul|first1=Sullivan|title=Chicago Cubs release pitcher Chad Gaudin|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2009-04-06/sports/0904050241_1_general-manager-jim-hendry-cubs-nice-ballpark|accessdate=February 26, 2015|work=Chicago Tribune|date=April 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===San Diego Padres===

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8426">'''Sir Christopher Barnewall'''  (1522–1575) was a leading [[Anglo-Irish]] statesman of [[the Pale]] in the 1560s and 1570s.  He  was the effective [[Leader of the Opposition]]  in the [[Irish House of Commons]] in the Parliament of 1568–71. He is remembered for building Turvey House, where he  sheltered  the future Catholic [[martyr]]  [[Edmund Campion]],  for his impressive tomb in [[Lusk, Dublin|Lusk]] Church,  and for the eulogy to him in [[Holinshed's Chronicles]],  which was written by his son-in-law Richard Stanyhurst.

== Background ==
He was the son of [[Patrick Barnewall (Solicitor General)|Patrick Barnewall]], [[Solicitor General for Ireland]] (died 1552),  and Anne Luttrell, daughter of Richard Luttrell.&lt;ref name="Ball"&gt;Ball, F. Elrington (1926). ''The Judges in Ireland 1221–1921''. London: John Murray.&lt;/ref&gt; Through both his paternal grandparents he was closely related to the senior branch of the Barnewall  family, who held the  title  [[Baron Trimleston]]. His father, a close associate of [[Thomas Cromwell]], was a key figure in the Irish administration between  1535 and 1542. Patrick initially opposed the [[Dissolution of the Monasteries]], but  changed his mind in  time to profit handsomely from the Dissolution, acquiring [[Grace Dieu Abbey]] in Dublin and [[Knocktopher]] in [[Kilkenny]].&lt;ref name="Ball"/&gt; Christopher himself built Turvey House near the ruins of Grace Dieu, reputedly from the Abbey's stones.

Unlike his father and his uncle [[Thomas Luttrell (Irish judge)|Thomas Luttrell]], who both went on to  become eminent  judges, he did  not practice at the [[Irish Bar]]. Nor was he a Bencher of the [[King's Inn]], which his father had helped  to found, although he was a  party to the renewal of the lease of the Inn from the Crown  in 1567.&lt;ref name="Kenny"&gt;Kenny, Colum (1992). ''The King's Inns and the Kingdom of Ireland''. Dublin: Irish Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt; He may however have had some legal training, since [[Thomas Butler, 10th Earl of Ormonde]], of whom he was a close associate,  appointed Barnewall in 1556  as steward and [[receivership |receiver]] of all the Earl's lands within the Pale.&lt;ref name="Kenny"/&gt;

== Politics ==
He sat in the Irish House of Commons as member for [[Dublin County (Parliament of Ireland constituency)|Dublin county]]   in the Parliaments of 1559-1560 and 1568-71,   and was [[Sheriff of County Dublin]] in 1560.  He played a major  role in [[Elizabeth I]]'s second Irish Parliament, especially in the crucial year 1569. He  emerged as the effective leader of the Anglo-Irish landowners of the Pale,  who were opposed to the Court party which supported  to the [[Lord Deputy of Ireland]], [[Sir Henry Sidney]]. His supporters attempted to have Barnewall chosen as  [[Speaker of the House of Commons (United Kingdom)|Speaker of the House of Commons]] but he was defeated by the Crown candidate [[James Stanyhurst]].&lt;ref name="Kenny"/&gt; Barnewall assumed the role of [[Leader of the Opposition]], concentrating his assault on the composition of the House, which he alleged had been "packed" with Crown supporters; in particular he objected to the presence of  certain English members who represented boroughs where they did not live, and which in many cases they had never even visited.  He  brought a legal challenge to  the validity of the House's composition, but although the judges ruled in his favour  on two technical  points, he was not successful in excluding the absentee members, and Sidney was able to get his  program of legislation through  Parliament without serious difficulty.

== Edmund Campion ==
[[Image:Edmund Campion.jpg|thumb|150px|Edmund Campion]]

As a Member of Parliament Barnewall was required under the ''Act of Supremacy (Ireland) 1560'' to acknowledge [[Elizabeth I]]  as head of the [[Church of Ireland]]. This was  an advantageous step since  his family  had benefitted greatly from the suppression of the religious houses, and, whatever their private religious beliefs, they  clearly had no wish to lose any of the lands which they had acquired.  Christopher's  own private sympathies were undoubtedly  with the Catholic  faith, which his son Patrick  in later years openly championed. Christopher  agreed to shelter the future martyr Edmund Campion in 1569, at the request of [[Richard Stanyhurst]] (son of James), who was Campion's pupil. Campion spent several weeks at Turvey House and later acknowledged Barnewall's role in saving his life. James Stanyhurst was also involved in sheltering  Campion , which suggests that despite their sharp  political rivalry,  he and Barnewall were prepared to cooperate on certain issues.

== Death and memorial ==
[[File:Lush Church (Co. Dublin).jpg|thumb|200px|View of Lusk Church in  1791]]

Barnewall died in 1575 and was buried in Lusk Church. His widow Marion, who remarried Sir Lucas Dillon, commissioned an impressive [[tomb ]] for her first  husband, dated 1589, which still exists. Her second husband apparently paid for it, suggesting that he shared the generally high opinion of Barnewall's character.  Marion died in 1607 and was buried in the same tomb.

== Character ==
Holinshed's Chronicles&lt;ref&gt;Holinshed, Raphael (1965).  ''Chronicles: England, Scotland and Ireland''.  Ed. Vernon P. Snow. New York.&lt;/ref&gt; contain a remarkable tribute to Barnewall; the warmly  personal tone is explained by the fact that it was written by Richard Stanyhurst, who know Barnewall all his life and married his daughter Janet:

&lt;blockquote&gt;the lantern and light as well of his house as of that part of Ireland where he dwelt, who being sufficiently well furnished with the knowledge of the [[Latin]] tongue as of the [[common law of England]], was zealously bent on the reformation of his country; a deep and a wise gentleman, spare of speech and therewithal pithy, wholly addicted to gravity....very upright in dealing, measuring all his affairs with the safety of conscience, as true as steel....fast to his friend, stout in a good quarrel, a great householder....of nature mild, rather choosing to pleasure where he might harm than harm where he might pleasure.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Family ==
Barnewall married Marion Sherle, daughter of Richard Sherle of Shallan, [[County Meath]]. They had nineteen  children,  of whom  thirteen reached adulthood:

* [[Patrick Barnewall (died 1622)|Patrick]] (died 1622), who inherited his father's estates, and was the father of the [[Nicholas Barnewall, 1st Viscount Barnewall|1st Viscount Barnewall]]
* John (died 1599) of Flemington, who married Cecily Cusack, widow of [[Christopher St Lawrence, 8th Baron Howth]], by whom he  had a son and heir, Patrick
* Catherine, who married Thomas Finglas of Westphailstown
* Margaret (died 1576),  who married [[Nicholas St Lawrence, 9th Baron Howth]] and had three children, including [[Christopher St Lawrence, 10th Baron Howth]]
* Janet (1560-1579),  who married  the celebrated historian [[Richard Stanyhurst]]
* Alison, who married  firstly John Plunkett and secondly Sir Edward FitzGerald of Tecroghan, County Meath
* Elizabeth (died 1607),  who married Richard (or John) Finglas of Westphailstown
* Anne (died 1639), who married Sir John Draycott of [[Mornington, County Meath]], son of [[Henry Draycott]], [[Master of the Rolls in Ireland]] and had six children
* Mabel (died 1620), who married Sir Richard Masterson of [[Ferns, County Wexford]]
* Ismay, who married Richard Delahide of Moyclare
* Eleanor (died 1628),  who married [[James Dillon, 1st Earl of Roscommon]]
* Maud, who married Richard Nugent
* Mary, who married Patrick Plunkett, 7th [[Baron Dunsany]]. &lt;ref&gt;Lodge, John  ''Peerage  of Ireland''  London 1784 Vol.3 p.49 &lt;/ref&gt;

Lady Barnewall remarried the prominent judge Sir [[Lucas Dillon]], who was father (by his first wife) of Eleanor's husband, [[James Dillon, 1st Earl of Roscommon]], as well as eleven other children.

'''Clara Germana Cele''' was a [[Christian]] woman, who in 1906, was said to be [[demon possession|possessed by a demon]].

==Possession==
She is said to have been possessed when she was a sixteen-year-old school girl at [[St. Michael's Mission (Natal, South Africa)|St. Michael's Mission]] in [[Colony of Natal|Natal, South Africa]]. The girl was an [[orphan]] of African origin and was [[baptism|baptised]] as an [[infant baptism|infant]].&lt;ref name="Paul C.

Moreover, Clara could not bear the presence of [[Sacramentals|blessed objects]] and seemed imbued with extraordinary strength and ferocity, often hurling nuns about the convent rooms and beating them up. The nun reported that the girl's cries had a savage bestiality that astonished those around her. In regards to the girls voice, an [[Attending physician|attending]] nun even wrote:  &lt;blockquote&gt;No animal had ever made such sounds. Neither the lions of East Africa nor the angry bulls. At times, it sounded like a veritable herd of wild beasts orchestrated by Satan had formed a hellish choir.

The girl, according to some, was said to have [[Levitation|levitated]] five feet in the air, sometimes vertically and sometimes horizontally; when sprinkled with [[holy water]], the girl is reported to have come out of this state of her [[demon possession|satanic possession]].&lt;ref name="J.

According to a ''[[Lutheran]] [[Pastoral care|Pastoral Handbook]]'', one possessing these symptoms is an indication that an individual is truly [[demon possession|possessed]], rather than suffering from a [[mental illness]].&lt;ref name="Mayes-Lutheran Exorcism"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.angelfire.com/ny4/djw/lutherantheology.demonpossession.html|title=Quotes and Paraphrases from Lutheran Pastoral Handbooks of the 16th and 17th Centuries on the Topic of Demon Possession|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=David Jay Webber|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=2009-05-27|quote=Symptoms of physical possession – One must be careful not to mistake demon possession for a natural disease.

These sorts of symptoms could stem from purely natural causes, or could be partially assisted by the devil.&lt;br/&gt;Primary symptoms of true possession: {{ordered list|The knowledge of secret things, for example, being able to predict the future (Acts 16:16), find lost people or things, or know complex things that one has never learned (e.g., medicine).

A '''consul''' is an official representative of the government of one [[Sovereign state|state]] in the territory of another, normally acting to assist and protect the [[citizen]]s of the consul's own country, and to facilitate trade and friendship between the people of the two countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Consul (commercial)|volume=7|pages=20–22}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

A consul is distinguished from an [[ambassador]], the latter being a representative from one [[head of state]] to another. There can be only one ambassador from one country to another, representing the first country's head of state to that of the second, and his or her duties revolve around diplomatic relations between the two countries; however, there may be several consuls, one in each of several major cities, providing assistance with bureaucratic issues to both the citizens of the consul's own country traveling or living abroad and to the citizens of the country in which the consul resides who wish to travel to or trade with the consul's country.

A less common usage is an [[Administrative consul|administrative consul]], who takes a governing role and is appointed by a country that has [[colonization|colonised]] or [[Military occupation|occupied]] another.

== Antecedent: the classical Greek proxenos ==
In [[classical Greece]], some of the functions of the modern consul were fulfilled by a [[proxenos]]. Unlike the modern position, this was a citizen of the host polity (in Greece, a [[city-state]]). The proxenos was usually a wealthy merchant who had [[socio-economic]] ties with another city and who helped its citizens when they were in trouble in his own city. The position of proxenos was often [[hereditary]] in a particular family. Modern honorary consuls fulfill a function that is to a degree similar to that of the ancient Greek institution.

==Historical development of the terms==
[[Consul]]s were the highest [[magistrate]]s of the [[Roman Republic]] and [[Roman Empire]]. The term was revived by the [[Republic of Genoa]], which, unlike Rome, bestowed it on various state officials, not necessarily restricted to the highest. Among these were Genoese officials stationed in various Mediterranean ports, whose role included duties similar to those of the modern consul, i. e. helping Genoese merchants and sailors in difficulties with the local authorities.

The ''[[consolat de mar]]'' was an institution established under the reign of [[Peter IV of Aragon]] in the fourteenth century, and spread to 47 locations throughout the Mediterranean.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Consulados de Barcelona | publisher = ''[[La Vanguardia]]'' | date = 7 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- The article will be freely accessible on the site of "La Vanguardia" after thirty days --&gt; It was primarily a judicial body, administering [[Maritime law|maritime]] and [[commercial law]] as ''[[Law Merchant|Lex Mercatoria]]''. Although the ''consolat de mar'' was established by the Corts General ([[parliament]]) of the [[Crown of Aragon]], the consuls were independent from the King. This distinction between consular and diplomatic functions remains (at least formally) to this day. Modern consuls retain limited judicial powers to settle disputes on ships from their country (notably regarding the payment of wages to sailors).

The ''[[consulado de mercaderes]]'' was set up in 1543 in [[Seville]] as a merchant guild to control trade with [[Latin America]]. As such, it had branches in the principal cities of the Spanish colonies.

The connection of "consul" with trade and commercial law is retained in French. In Francophone countries, a ''juge consulaire'' (consular judge) is a non-professional judge elected by the [[chamber of commerce]] to settle commercial disputes in the first instance (in France, sitting in panels of three; in Belgium, in conjunction with a professional magistrate).

The office of a consul is a '''consulate''' and is usually [[subordinate]] to the state's main representation in the capital of that foreign country (host state), usually an ''[[embassy]]'' or – between [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries – ''[[high commission (Commonwealth)|high commission]]''. Like the term ''embassy'', ''consulate'' may refer not only to the office of consul, but also to the building occupied by the consul and his or her staff. The consulate may share premises with the embassy itself.

===Consular rank===
A consul of the highest rank is termed a ''consul-general'', and is appointed to a ''consulate-general''. There are typically one or more ''deputy consuls-general'', ''consuls'', ''vice-consuls'' and ''consular agents'' working under the consul-general. A country may appoint more than one consul-general to another nation. 

===Authority and activities===
Consuls of various ranks may have specific legal authority for certain activities, such as notarizing documents. As such, diplomatic personnel with other responsibilities may receive consular [[letters patent]] (commissions). Aside from those outlined in the [[Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations]], there are few formal requirements outlining what a consular official must do. For example, for some countries, consular officials may be responsible for the issue of visas; other countries may limit "consular services" to providing assistance to compatriots, legalization of documents, etc. Nonetheless, consulates proper will be headed by consuls of various ranks, even if such officials have little or no connection with the more limited sense of consular service.

Activities of a consulate include protecting the interests of their citizens temporarily or permanently resident in the host country, issuing [[passport]]s; issuing [[Visa (document)|visas]] to foreigners and [[public diplomacy]]. However, the principal role of a consulate lies traditionally in promoting trade—assisting companies to invest and to import and export goods and services both inwardly to their home country and outward to their host country. Although it is not admitted publicly, consulates, like embassies, may also gather [[intelligence (information gathering)|intelligence]] information from the assigned country.

====Consular districts====
{{main article|consular district}}

===Role in diplomatic missions===
{{Original research|section|date=April 2017}}Contrary to popular belief, many of the staff of consulates may be career diplomats, but they do not generally have [[diplomatic immunity]] unless they are also accredited as such. Immunities and privileges for consuls and accredited staff of consulates ([[consular immunity]]) are generally limited to actions undertaken in their official capacity and, with respect to the consulate itself, to those required for official duties. In practice, the extension and application of consular privileges and immunities can differ widely from country to country.

Consulates are more numerous than diplomatic missions, such as [[Embassy|embassies]]. Ambassadors are posted only in a foreign nation's capital (but exceptionally outside the country, as in the case of a multiple mandate; e.g., a minor power may accredit a single ambassador with several neighbouring states of modest relative importance that are not considered important allies). 

Consuls are posted in a nation's capital, and in other cities throughout that country, especially centres of economic activity and cities where large populations of citizens from the consul's home country reside ([[expatriate]]s). In the [[United States]], for example, most countries have a consulate-general in [[New York City]], (the home of the [[United Nations]]), and some have consulates-general in several major cities, such as [[Atlanta]], [[Dallas]],  [[Los Angeles]], [[Miami]], or [[San Francisco]]. Many countries have multiple consular offices in nations such as Germany, Russia, Canada, Brazil, and Australia.

Consulates are subordinate posts of their home country's diplomatic mission (typically an [[embassy]], in the capital city of the host country). Diplomatic missions are established in [[international law]] under the [[Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations]], while consulates-general and consulates are established in international law under the [[Vienna Convention on Consular Relations]]. Formally, at least within the US system, the consular career (ranking in descending order: consul-general, consul, vice-consul, honorary consul) forms a different hierarchy from the diplomats in the strict sense. However, it is common for individuals to be transferred from one hierarchy to the other, and for consular officials to serve in a capital carrying out strictly consular duties within the ''consular section'' of a diplomatic post; e.g., within an embassy.

Between [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries, both diplomatic and consular activities may be undertaken by a [[High Commission]] in the capital, although larger Commonwealth nations generally also have consulates and consulates-general in major cities. For example, [[Toronto]] in [[Canada]], [[Sydney]] in Australia and [[Auckland]], New Zealand, are of greater economic importance than their respective national capitals, hence the need for consulates there.

Owing to its status as a [[Special administrative regions of China|special administrative region]] of [[China]], some countries' consulates-general in Hong Kong report directly to their respective [[foreign ministry|foreign ministries]], rather than to their embassies in [[Beijing]], such as those of [[Consulate General of Canada in Hong Kong and Macao|Canada]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.international.gc.ca/department-ministere/inspection/2010/hong_kong.aspx?lang=eng|title=Inspection reports|first=Foreign Affairs Trade and Development Canada|last=Government of Canada|date=|work=International.GC.ca|access-date=14 April 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161005230150/http://www.international.gc.ca/department-ministere/inspection/2010/hong_kong.aspx?lang=eng|archivedate=5 October 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[British Consulate-General, Hong Kong|United Kingdom]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201415/cmselect/cmfaff/649/64907.htm|title=House of Commons - The UK's relations with Hong Kong: 30 years after the Joint Declaration - Foreign Affairs|first=The Committee Office, House of|last=Commons|date=|work=Parliament.uk|access-date=14 April 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170525090559/https://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201415/cmselect/cmfaff/649/64907.htm|archivedate=25 May 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Consulate General of the United States, Hong Kong and Macau|United States]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ait.org.tw/en/pressrelease-pr1224.htm Christopher J.

==Consul general==
A consul general is an official who heads a consulate general and is a consul of the highest rank serving at a particular location. A consul general may also be responsible for [[consul (representative)#Consular districts|consular districts]] which contain other, subordinate consular offices within a country. The consul general serves as a representative who speaks on behalf of his or her state in the country to which he or she is located, although ultimate jurisdiction over the right to speak on behalf of a home country within another country ultimately belongs to the single ambassador. It is abbreviated "CG", and the plural form is 'consuls general'. In most embassies, the consular section is headed by a consul general who is a diplomat and a member of the ambassador's country team.

==Honorary consul==
[[File:Polish Consul Jer.JPG|thumb|Home of [[Poland]]'s honorary consul in [[Jerusalem]]]]
Some consuls are not career officials of the represented state at all; some are locally engaged staff with the nationality of the sending country,&lt;ref&gt;See Chapter 1, Section 1, Article 22 of convention&lt;/ref&gt; and in smaller cities, or in cities that are very distant from full-time diplomatic missions, a foreign government which feels that some form of representation is nevertheless desirable may appoint a person who has not hitherto been part of their diplomatic service to fulfill this role. Such a consul may well combine the job with his or her own (often commercial) private activities, and in some instances may not even be a citizen of the sending country. Such consular appointments are usually given the title of ''honorary consul''.

In addition, the [[U.S. Secretary of State]] (in a memo issued on August 6, 2003) states the following concerning honorary consuls:

{{quote|The United States Government appreciates that honorary consular officers provide important services both to the governments which they represent and to United States citizens and entities. Nevertheless, for reasons previously communicated to the missions, United States Government policy requires that the maintenance and establishment of consular posts headed by honorary consular officers must be supported by documentation which makes it possible for the [[US Department of State|Department of State]] to be assured that meaningful consular functions will be exercised by honorary consular officers on a regular basis and that such consular officers come under the supervision of, and are accountable to, the governments which they represent."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.state.gov/documents/organization/124944.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-06-24 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170525095046/https://www.state.gov/documents/organization/124944.pdf |archivedate=25 May 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

As a matter of U.S. policy, honorary consular officers recognized by the U.S. Government are American citizens, or permanent resident aliens who perform consular services on a part-time basis. The limited immunity afforded honorary consular officers is specified in Article 71 of the [[Vienna Convention on Consular Relations]] (VCCR). Such individuals do not enjoy personal inviolability, and may be arrested pending trial if circumstances should otherwise warrant. However, appropriate steps are provided to accord to such officers the protection required by virtue of their official position. In addition, the consular archives and documents of a consular post headed by an honorary consular officer are inviolable at all times, and wherever they may be, provided they are kept separate from other papers and documents of a private or commercial nature relating to other activities of an honorary consular officer or persons working with that consular officer.

Despite their other roles, honorary consular officers (in the widest use of the term) in some instances also have responsibility for the welfare of citizens of the appointing country within their [[bailiwick]].&lt;ref name=FinlandHonCon/&gt; For example, the Embassy of [[Finland]] states that the tasks of [[Finland's Honorary Consulate]] include monitoring the rights of Finns and permanent residents of Finland residing in the area in which the consulate is located, providing advice and guidance for distressed Finnish citizens and permanent residents traveling abroad to that area, and assisting them in their contacts with local authorities or the nearest Finnish embassy or consulate. Certain types of notarized certificates can be acquired through an honorary consul. Together with diplomatic missions, an honorary consul promotes economic and cultural relations between Finland and the country in question, and takes part in strengthening Finland’s image abroad. An honorary consul can advise Finnish companies, for instance, in obtaining information about local business culture and in finding cooperation partners.&lt;ref name=FinlandHonCon&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.finland.org/public/default.aspx?nodeid=44646&amp;contentlan=2&amp;culture=en-US |title=Honorary consulates of Finland in the U.S. – Embassy of Finland, Washington – Consulate Generals of Finland, New York, Los Angeles : Finland in the US : Finnish Honorary Consuls |publisher=Finland.org |date=2011-12-15 |accessdate=2013-12-21 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224105615/http://www.finland.org/public/default.aspx?nodeid=44646&amp;contentlan=2&amp;culture=en-US |archivedate=24 December 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical role==
===Lübeck===
In the social life of 19th-century [[Lübeck]] as depicted in [[Thomas Mann]]'s novel ''[[Buddenbrooks]]'' – based on Mann's thorough personal knowledge of his own birthplace – an appointment as the consul of a foreign country was a source of considerable social prestige among the city's merchant elite. As depicted in the book, the position of a consul for a particular country was in practice hereditary in a specific family, whose mansion bore the represented country's coat of arms, and with that country confirming the consul's son or other heir in the position on the death of the previous consul. As repeatedly referenced by Mann, a consul's wife was known as "Consulin" and continued to bear that title even on the death of her husband. Characters in the book are mentioned as consuls for [[Denmark]], the [[Netherlands]] and [[Portugal]].

==Early life and education==
Castle grew up in [[Kingsport, Tennessee]]. He attended Ketron High School and [[East Tennessee State University]] (ETSU), graduating in 1966 and 1970, respectively.  At ETSU, he earned a [[Bachelor of Science|B.S.]] degree, double-majoring in [[political science]] and [[history]].

Castle then became a commissioned officer in the [[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marine Corps]], serving for four years and attaining the rank of first lieutenant.&lt;ref name="ConstitutionParty1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.constitutionparty.com/news.php?aid=365 |title=As Veterans Day Approaches, the Constitution Party salutes its own and all Americans who have served in our nation’s military forces! |date=November 10, 2006 |publisher=Constitution Party National Committee |accessdate=November 12, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081113033357/http://www.constitutionparty.com/news.php?aid=365 |archivedate=November 13, 2008 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;  After his discharge, he returned to ETSU and began his graduate study of history.  He then attended the law school at [[University of Memphis|Memphis State University]] and earned a [[Juris Doctor|J.D.]] in 1979.

Castle has served as a deacon and deacon chairman in his local church.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.castlereport.us/who-is-darrell-castle|title=Who is Darrell Castle?|website=The Castle Report|accessdate=April 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998, he and his wife founded Mia’s Children Foundation, a Christian mission in Bucharest, Romania which ministers to homeless Romani children.&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt;

==Law career==
Upon receiving his law degree in [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]], Castle became an attorney. In 1984, he opened a private firm which later grew into Darrell Castle and Associates. Since then, Castle has opened firms in [[Milwaukee]], [[Detroit]], and [[Kansas City, Missouri]]. His firms focus on consumer bankruptcy and personal injury, but also represent clients in the areas of social security, disability, and workers' compensation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.darrellcastle.com/|title=Memphis Bankruptcy Attorneys &amp; Personal Injury Lawyers|website=darrellcastle.com|accessdate=April 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political involvement==
{{moresources|section|date=November 2016}}
At the [[2008 Constitution Party National Convention]] in [[Kansas City, Missouri]], [[Baptist]] pastor [[Chuck Baldwin]] defeated former [[Assistant Secretary of State for International Organization Affairs]] [[Alan Keyes]] to win the party's nomination. The party then nominated Castle to the ticket as its vice presidential candidate. Baldwin had been the Constitution Party nominee for Vice President in 2004.

At the [[2012 Constitution Party National Convention]] in [[Nashville, Tennessee]], Castle declared his candidacy for the party's presidential nomination one day prior to the nomination vote, citing requests from several delegates that he seek the nomination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.independentpoliticalreport.com/2012/04/news-flash-darrell-castle-to-seek-constitution-party-nomination/|title=NEWS FLASH: Darrell Castle to Seek Constitution Party Nomination|date=April 20, 2012|work=Independent Political Report}}&lt;/ref&gt; He finished as runner-up to former United States Congressman [[Virgil Goode]], who won the nomination on the first ballot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.independentpoliticalreport.com/2012/04/virgil-goode-wins-constitution-party-nomination-on-first-ballot-picks-vp-choice/|title=Virgil Goode Wins Constitution Party Nomination on First Ballot, Picks VP Choice|date=April 21, 2012|work=Independent Political Report}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Castle is the former National Vice-Chairman of the Constitution Party.

Castle was a candidate for the Constitution Party's 2016 presidential nomination, but withdrew his candidacy in January 2016 because of unspecified health concerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Staff|url=http://ballot-access.org/2016/01/06/darrell-castle-withdraws-from-constitution-party-presidential-nomination-race|title=Darrell Castle Withdraws from Constitution Party Presidential Nomination Race|publisher=Ballot Access News|date=January 6, 2016|accessdate=August 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, on the eve of the 2016 nominating convention, [[Richard Winger]] of ''[[Ballot Access News]]'' reported that Castle had re-entered the nomination process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://ballot-access.org/2016/04/12/joe-miller-decides-not-to-seek-constitution-party-presidential-nomination/|title=Joe Miller Decides Not to Seek Constitution Party Presidential Nomination|website=ballot-access.org|publisher=Ballot Access News|date=April 12, 2016|accessdate=April 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He favors ending the [[Federal Reserve System|Federal Reserve]].&lt;ref name=LH/&gt;

On June 12, 2016, Castle directly indicated a number of his political positions on the website iSideWith, which seeks to match voters with the candidates whose positions most closely match users' policy preferences as determined by a multiple-choice survey.&lt;ref name=ISW/&gt; Castle presents himself as [[Gun politics in the United States|pro-gun]] and pro-[[Second Amendment to the United States Constitution|Second Amendment]], indicating that he believes there should not be "more restrictions on the current process of purchasing a gun" and is against banning individuals on the [[no-fly list]] from "purchasing guns and ammunition."

He believes that constitutional rights extend to foreign nationals suspected of terrorism, but only "inside the United States and not abroad".{{cn|date=November 2016}}

Castle believes "physically and mentally capable adults on [[welfare]]" should be required to work. However, he opposes drug tests for welfare recipients as an infringement of privacy. He has expressed opposition to any government regulation of employee compensation by private businesses. He does not believe that [[Illegal immigration to the United States|illegal immigrants]] should have access to government healthcare or [[Tuition payments#College tuition for undocumented students|in-state tuition rates]]. He is against the [[Affordable Care Act]]. He opposes governmental [[environmental law|environmental regulations]].{{cn|date=November 2016}}

Castle opposes [[Term limits in the United States|term limits]] for members of Congress, believing that elections suffice to test the effectiveness of officeholders.&lt;ref name=ISW/&gt;

'''Edward John Moreton Drax Plunkett, 18th Baron of Dunsany''' ({{IPAc-en|d|ʌ|n|ˈ|s|eɪ|n|i}}; 24 July 1878 – 25 October 1957), was an [[Anglo-Irish]] writer and dramatist; his work, mostly in the [[fantasy literature|fantasy]] genre, was published under the name '''Lord Dunsany'''.  More than ninety books of his work were published in his lifetime,&lt;ref name="Biblio"&gt;Lanham, Maryland, USA, 1993: Rowman &amp; Littlefield; Joshi, S.T. and Schweitzer, Darrell; Lord Dunsany: A Comprehensive Bibliography (Studies in Supernatural Literature series); 304 pp.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|29 (I.A.92)}} and both original work and compilations have continued to appear.  Dunsany's œuvre includes many hundreds of published short stories, as well as plays, novels and essays. He achieved great fame and success with his early short stories and plays, and during the 1910s was considered one of the greatest living writers of the English-speaking world; he is today best known for his 1924 [[fantasy]] novel ''[[The King of Elfland's Daughter]]''.

Born and raised in [[London]], to the second-oldest title (created 1439) in the [[Peerage of Ireland|Irish peerage]], Dunsany lived much of his life at what may be [[Ireland|Ireland's]] longest-inhabited house, [[Dunsany Castle]] near [[Tara, Ireland|Tara]], worked with [[W. B. Yeats]] and [[Lady Gregory]], received an honorary doctorate from [[Trinity College, Dublin]], was chess and pistol-shooting champion of Ireland, and travelled and [[fox hunting|hunted]] extensively.  He died in [[Dublin]] after an attack of [[appendicitis]].

==Biography==
===Early life===
Edward Plunkett (''Dunsany''), known to his family as "Eddie," was the first son of [[John William Plunkett, 17th Baron of Dunsany]] (1853–1899), and his wife, Ernle Elizabeth Louisa Maria Grosvenor [[Ernle]]-Erle-Drax, {{née}} Ernle Elizabeth Louisa Maria Grosvenor Burton (1855–1916).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.geni.com/people/Edward-Plunkett-18th-Baron-of-Dunsany/6000000000629554702|title=Edward John Moreton Drax Plunkett, 18th Baron of Dunsany|website=geni_family_tree|language=en-US|access-date=2017-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From a historically wealthy and famous family, Lord Dunsany was related to many well-known [[Irish people|Irish]] figures.  He was a kinsman of the [[Roman Catholic|Catholic]] Saint [[Oliver Plunkett]], the martyred [[Archbishop of Armagh (Roman Catholic)|Archbishop of Armagh]], whose ring and crozier head are still held by the Dunsany family.  He was also related to the prominent Anglo-Irish unionist, and later nationalist / [[Irish Home Rule|Home Rule]] politician [[Sir Horace Plunkett]], and [[George Noble Plunkett|George Count Plunkett]], [[Papal Count]] and Republican politician, father of [[Joseph Plunkett]], executed for his part in the 1916 Rising.

His mother was a cousin of [[Sir Richard Burton]], and he inherited from her considerable height, being 6' 4".  The Countess of Fingall, wife of Dunsany's cousin, the [[Earl of Fingall]], wrote a best-selling account of the life of the aristocracy in Ireland in the late 19th century and early 20th century, called ''Seventy Years Young''.

Plunkett's only grown sibling, a younger brother, from whom he was estranged from around 1916, for reasons not fully clear but connected to his mother's will, was the noted British naval officer [[Reginald Drax|Sir Reginald Drax]]. Another, younger, brother died in infancy.

[[File:Beatrice Child Villiers.jpg|thumb|left|Beatrice Child Villiers, Lady Dunsany]]
Edward Plunkett grew up at the family properties, most notably Dunstall Priory in [[Shoreham, Kent|Shoreham]], [[Kent]], and [[Dunsany Castle]] in [[County Meath]], but also family homes such as in London. His schooling was at [[Cheam School|Cheam]], [[Eton College]] and finally the [[Royal Military College, Sandhurst]], which he entered in 1896.

===Title and marriage===
The title passed to him at his father's death at a fairly young age, in 1899, and the young Lord Dunsany returned to [[Dunsany Castle]] after war duty, in 1901.  In that year he was also confirmed as an elector for the [[Representative Peers]] for Ireland in the [[House of Lords]].

In 1903, he met Lady Beatrice Child Villiers (1880–1970), youngest daughter of [[Victor Child Villiers, 7th Earl of Jersey|The 7th Earl of Jersey]] (head of the Jersey banking family), who was then living at [[Osterley Park]], and they were married in 1904.  Their only child, Randal, was born in 1906. Beatrice was supportive of Dunsany's interests, and assisted him in his writing, typing his manuscripts, helping to select work for his collections, including the 1954 retrospective short story collection, and overseeing his literary heritage after his death.

The Dunsanys were socially active in both [[Dublin]] and London, and travelled between their homes in Meath, London and [[Kent]], other than during [[World War I|World Wars I]] and [[World War II|II]], and the [[Irish War of Independence]].  Dunsany himself circulated with many other literary figures of the time.  To many of these in Ireland he was first introduced by his uncle, the co-operative pioneer [[Sir Horace Plunkett]], who also helped to manage his estate and investments for a time.  He was friendly with, for example, [[George William Russell]], [[Oliver St. John Gogarty]] and, for a time, [[William Butler Yeats|W. B. Yeats]].  He also socialised at times with [[George Bernard Shaw]], [[H.G. Wells]] and was a friend of [[Rudyard Kipling]].

In 1910 Dunsany commissioned a two-storey extension to Dunsany Castle, with a billiards room, bedrooms and other facilities.  The billiards room includes the crests of all the Lords Dunsany up to the 18th.

===Military experience===
[[File:Edward Plunkett Lord Dunsany.jpg|thumb|upright|Dunsany as Captain, [[Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers]], in the First World War]]
Dunsany served as a Second Lieutenant in the [[Coldstream Guards]] during the [[Second Boer War]].

He volunteered in the [[World War I|First World War]], and was appointed Captain in the [[Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers]].  He was stationed for some time at [[Ebrington Barracks]] in [[Derry]].  Having heard of disturbances in Dublin in 1916, during the [[Easter Rising]], while on leave, he drove in to offer assistance and was wounded, with a bullet lodged in his skull.&lt;ref&gt;Leonard R. N. Ashley, ‘Plunkett, Edward John Moreton Drax, eighteenth Baron Dunsany (1878–1957)’, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, May 2006 [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/35547, accessed 26 Nov 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.irelandseye.com/aarticles/history/people/writers/dunsany.shtm|title=Edward Plunkett, Lord Dunsany|website=www.irelandseye.com|access-date=2017-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After recovery at Jervis Street Hospital, and later what was then the King George V Hospital (now [[St. Bricin's Military Hospital]]), he returned to duty. His military belt was lost in this episode and was later used at the burial of [[Michael Collins (Irish leader)|Michael Collins]].  Having been refused forward positioning in 1916, being listed as valuable as a trainer, in the latter stages of the war he spent time in the trenches, and in the very last period wrote propaganda material for the War Office with MI7b(1).  At Dunsany Castle there is a book of wartime photos with lost members of his command marked.

During the [[World War II|Second World War]], Dunsany signed up for the [[Irish Army Reserve]] and the [[British Home Guard]], the two countries' local defence forces, and was especially active in [[Shoreham, Kent]], the most-bombed village in England during the [[Battle of Britain]].

===Literary life===
[[File:LordDinNY 1919 41yo B.jpg|thumb|left|Lord Dunsany, New York, 1919]]
Dunsany's fame arose chiefly from his prolific writings, and he was involved with the [[Irish Literary Revival]]. Supporting the Revival, Dunsany was a major donor to the [[Abbey Theatre]], and he moved in Irish literary circles. He was well-acquainted with [[W. B. Yeats]] (who rarely acted as editor, but gathered and published a Dunsany selection), [[Lady Gregory]], [[Percy French]], "AE" Russell, Oliver St John Gogarty, [[Padraic Colum]] (with whom he jointly wrote a play) and others. He befriended and supported [[Francis Ledwidge]] to whom he gave the use of his library&lt;ref&gt;A Dictionary of Irish History since 1800, D. J. Hickey &amp; J. E. Doherty, Gill &amp; MacMillan (1980)&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Mary Lavin]].

Dunsany made his first literary tour to the United States in 1919, and made further such visits right up to the 1950s, in the early years mostly to the eastern seaboard, later notably to California.

Dunsany's own work, and contribution to the Irish literary heritage, was recognised through an honorary degree from [[Trinity College, Dublin]].{{Clear}}

===Early 1940s===
In 1940, Dunsany was appointed Byron Professor of English in [[Athens University]], Greece.  Having reached Athens by a circuitous route, he was so successful that he was offered a post as Professor of English in [[Istanbul]].  However, he had to be evacuated due to the [[German invasion of Greece]] in April 1941, returning home by an even more complex route than he had come on, his travels forming a basis for a long poem published in book form (A Journey, in 5 cantos: The Battle of Britain, The Battle of Greece, The Battle of the Mediterranean, Battles Long Ago, The Battle of the Atlantic; Special edition January 1944). [[Olivia Manning]]'s character, "Lord Pinkrose", in her [[novel sequence]], the ''[[Fortunes of War (novel series)|Fortunes of War]]'', was a mocking portrait of Dunsany during this period.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Cooper|1989|p=159}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Braybrooke|Braybrooke|2004|p=110}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later life===
In 1947, Dunsany transferred his Meath estate to his son and heir under a trust, and settled in Kent, at his [[Shoreham, Kent|Shoreham]] house, Dunstall Priory and farm, not far from the home of [[Rudyard Kipling]], a friend.  He visited Ireland only occasionally thereafter, and engaged actively in life in Shoreham and London.  He also began a new period of visits to the United States, notably California, as recounted in Hazel Littlefield-Smith's biographical "Dunsany, King of Dreams."

===Death===
In 1957, Lord Dunsany became ill while eating with the [[Earl of Fingall|Earl]] and Countess of Fingall at Dunsany, in what proved to be an attack of [[appendicitis]], and died in hospital in Dublin at the age of 79.  He had directed that he be buried in the churchyard of the ancient church of St. Peter and St. Paul, Shoreham, Kent, in memory of shared war times.  His funeral was attended by a wide range of family (including the Pakenhams, Jerseys and Fingals) and Shoreham figures, and representatives of his old regiment and various bodies in which he had taken an interest.  A memorial service was held at [[Kilmessan]] in Meath, with a reading of [[Crossing the Bar]] which was noted as coinciding with a passing flock of geese.

Lady Beatrice survived Lord Dunsany, living on primarily at Shoreham, overseeing his literary legacy until her death in 1970, while their son, Randal, succeeded him in the Barony, and was in turn succeeded by his grandson, the artist Edward Plunkett, to whom literary rights passed directly.

===Interests===
Aside from his literary work, Dunsany was a keen [[chess]] player, set chess puzzles for journals including ''[[The Times]]'' (of London), played [[José Raúl Capablanca]] to a draw (in a [[simultaneous exhibition]]), and also invented [[Dunsany's Chess]], an asymmetric [[chess variant]] that is notable for not involving any [[fairy pieces]], unlike many variants that require the player to learn unconventional piece movements.  He was president of both the [[Irish Chess Union]] and the Kent County Chess Association for some years, and of Sevenoaks Chess Club for 54 years.

Dunsany was a keen horseman and hunter, for many years hosting the hounds of a local hunt, as well as hunting in parts of Africa, and sportsman, and was at one time the [[pistol]]-shooting champion of Ireland.

Dunsany also campaigned for animal rights, being known especially for his opposition to the [[docking (dog)|"docking"]] of dogs' tails, and was president of the West Kent branch of the [[Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals|RSPCA]] in his later years.

He enjoyed [[cricket]], provided the local cricket ground situated near Dunsany Crossroads, and later played for and presided at Shoreham Cricket Club in Kent.

He was a supporter of [[Scouting]] over many years, serving as President of the [[Sevenoaks]] district [[Boy Scouts Association]].  He also supported the amateur drama group, the Shoreham Players.

Dunsany provided support for the [[British Legion]] in both Ireland and Kent, including grounds in [[Trim, County Meath|Trim]] and poetry for the Irish branch's annual memorial service on a number of occasions.

==Writings==
Dunsany was a prolific writer, penning short stories, novels, plays, poetry, essays and autobiography, and publishing over 90 books in his lifetime, not including individual plays. Books have continued to appear, with more than 120 having issued as of 2017.  Dunsany's works have been published in many languages.

===Early career===
The then Edward Plunkett began his authorial career in the late 1890s, with a few published verses, such as "Rhymes from a Suburb" and "The Spirit of the Bog", but he made a lasting impression in 1905 when he burst onto the publishing scene, writing as Lord Dunsany, with the well-received collection ''[[The Gods of Pegāna]].''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Edward-John-Moreton-Drax-Plunkett-18th-Baron-of-Dunsany|title=Edward John Moreton Drax Plunkett, 18th baron of Dunsany {{!}} Irish dramatist|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2017-07-12|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Early fantasy====
Dunsany's most notable [[fantasy]] short stories were published in collections from 1905 to 1919, though fantasy as a genre did not yet exist, so they were just a curious form of literature. He paid for the publication of the first collection, ''The Gods of Pegāna,'' earning a commission on sales. This he never again had to do, the vast majority of his extensive writings selling.&lt;ref&gt;[[L. Sprague de Camp]], ''[[Literary Swordsmen and Sorcerers]]: The Makers of Heroic Fantasy,'' p 53 {{ISBN|0-87054-076-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The stories in his first two books, and perhaps the beginning of his third, were set within an invented world, Pegāna, with its own gods, history and geography. Starting with this book, Dunsany's name is linked to that of [[Sidney Sime]], his chosen artist, who illustrated much of his work, notably until 1922.&lt;ref&gt;L. Sprague de Camp, ''Literary Swordsmen and Sorcerers: The Makers of Heroic Fantasy,'' p 54-5 {{ISBN|0-87054-076-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Style====
Dunsany's style varied significantly throughout his writing career. Prominent Dunsany scholar [[S. T. Joshi]] has described these shifts as Dunsany moving on after he felt he had exhausted the potential of a style or medium.  From the naïve fantasy of his earliest writings, through his early short story work in 1904–1908, he turned to the self-conscious fantasy of ''The Book of Wonder'' in 1912, in which he almost seems to be parodying his lofty early style.

Each of his collections varies in mood; ''[[A Dreamer's Tales]]'' varies from the wistfulness of "Blagdaross" to the horrors of "Poor Old Bill" and "Where the Tides Ebb and Flow" to the social satire of "The Day of the Poll."

The opening paragraph of "[[The Hoard of the Gibbelins]]" from ''[[The Book of Wonder]],'' (1912) gives a good indication of both the tone and tenor of Dunsany's style at the time:

:The Gibbelins eat, as is well known, nothing less good than man. Their evil tower is joined to Terra Cognita, to the lands we know, by a bridge. Their hoard is beyond reason; avarice has no use for it; they have a separate cellar for emeralds and a separate cellar for sapphires; they have filled a hole with gold and dig it up when they need it. And the only use that is known for their ridiculous wealth is to attract to their larder a continual supply of food. In times of famine they have even been known to scatter rubies abroad, a little trail of them to some city of Man, and sure enough their larders would soon be full again.

===Drama===
After ''[[The Book of Wonder]],'' Dunsany began to write plays – many of which were even more successful, at the time, than his early story collections – while also continuing to write short stories. He continued to write plays for the theatre into the 1930s, including the famous ''If'', and a number for radio production.&lt;ref&gt;[[Martin Gardner]], "Lord Dunsany" in ''Supernatural Fiction Writers: Fantasy and Horror'' (1985) edited by [[E.

Although many of Dunsany's stage plays were successfully produced within his lifetime, he also wrote a number of "chamber plays" (or [[closet dramas]]), which were intended only to be read privately (as if they were stories) or performed on the radio, rather than staged {{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}. Some of Dunsany's chamber or radio plays contain supernatural events – such as a character spontaneously appearing out of thin air, or vanishing in full view of the audience, without any explanation of how the effect is to be staged, a matter of no importance, since Dunsany did not intend these works actually to be performed live and visible.

===Middle period===
Following a successful lecture touring in the US in 1919–1920 and with his reputation now principally related to his plays, Dunsany temporarily reduced his output of short stories, concentrating on plays, novels and poetry for a time.

His poetry, now little seen, was for a time so popular that it is recited by the lead character of [[F. Scott Fitzgerald]]'s ''[[This Side of Paradise]]'' and one of his poems, the sonnet ''A Dirge of Victory'' - the only poem included in the Armistice Day edition of the [[Times of London]].

Launching another phase of his work, Dunsany's first novel, ''[[Don Rodriguez: Chronicles of Shadow Valley]]'', was published in 1922. It is set in "a Romantic Spain that never was," and follows the adventures of a young nobleman, Don Rodriguez, and his servant in their search for a castle for Rodriguez. It has been argued that Dunsany's inexperience with the novel form shows in the episodic nature of ''Don Rodriguez.'' In 1924, Dunsany published his second novel, ''[[The King of Elfland's Daughter]],'' a return to his early style of writing, which is considered by many to be Dunsany's finest novel and a classic in the realm of the fantasy writing.  In his next novel, ''[[The Charwoman's Shadow]],'' Dunsany returned to the Spanish milieu and to the light style of ''Don Rodriguez,'' to which it is related.

Though his style and medium shifted frequently, Dunsany's thematic concerns remained essentially the same. Many of Dunsany's later novels had an explicitly Irish theme, from the semi-autobiographical ''[[The Curse of the Wise Woman]]'' to ''His Fellow Men.''

One of Dunsany's best-known characters was [[Joseph Jorkens]], an obese middle-aged raconteur who frequented the fictional Billiards Club in London, and who would tell fantastic stories if someone would buy him a large whiskey and soda.  From his tales, it was obvious that Mr Jorkens had travelled to all seven continents, was extremely resourceful, and well-versed in world cultures, but always came up short on becoming rich and famous. The ''Jorkens'' books, which sold well, were among the first of a type which was to become popular in fantasy and science fiction writing: extremely improbable "club tales" told at a gentleman's club or bar.

Dunsany's writing habits were considered peculiar by some. Lady Beatrice said that "He always sat on a crumpled old hat while composing his tales." (The hat was eventually stolen by a visitor to Dunsany Castle.) Dunsany almost never rewrote anything; everything he ever published was a first draft.&lt;ref&gt;[[Darrell Schweitzer]],''Pathways to Elfland: The Writings of Lord Dunsany'' (1989) Owlswick Press, {{ISBN|0-913896-16-0}} .&lt;/ref&gt; Much of his work was penned with quill pens, which he made himself; Lady Beatrice was usually the first to see the writings, and would help type them. It has been said that Lord Dunsany would sometimes conceive stories while hunting, and would return to the Castle and draw in his family and servants to re-enact his visions before he set them on paper.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}

===Translations===
Dunsany's work was translated from an early stage, to languages including Spanish, French, Japanese, German, Italian, Dutch, Russian, Czech and Turkish.  His uncle, Horace Plunkett, mentioned that he had been translated into 14 languages already by the 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;Plunkett, Horace Curzon: Diaries, as transcribed by Targett, Kate (Reading Room, National Library of Ireland&lt;/ref&gt;

==Memberships, awards and honours==
Lord Dunsany was a Fellow of the [[Royal Society of Literature]], a member, and at once point the President, of the Authors' Society, and likewise President of the Shakespeare Reading Society from 1938 until his death in 1957, succeeded by [[John Gielgud|Sir John Gielgud]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shakespearereadingsociety.co.uk/history/ The History of the Shakespeare Reading Society]&lt;/ref&gt;

Dunsany was also a Fellow of the [[Royal Geographical Society]], and an honorary member of the Institut Historique et Heraldique de France.

He was initially an Associate Member of the Irish Academy of Letters, founded by Yeats and others, and later a full member. At one of their banquets, he asked [[Seán Ó Faoláin]], who was presiding, "Do we not toast the King?" O'Faolain replied that there was only one toast: to the Nation; but after it was given and he'd called for coffee, Dunsany stood quietly among the bustle, raised his glass discreetly, and whispered "God bless him."&lt;ref&gt;O'Faolain, ''Vive Moi!'', pp. 350 ''n'', 353&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Curse of the Wise Woman'' received the Harmsworth Literary Award in Ireland.

Dunsany received an honorary doctorate, D.Litt., from [[Trinity College, Dublin]], in 1940.

Dunsany was nominated for the Nobel Prize by Irish PEN, but lost to [[Bertrand Russell]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nomination/literature/nomination.php?action=show&amp;showid=1127|title=Nomination Database - Literature|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influences==
* Dunsany studied Greek and Latin, particularly [[Greek drama]] and [[Herodotus]], the "Father of History". Dunsany wrote in a letter: "When I learned Greek at Cheam and heard of other gods a great pity came on me for those beautiful marble people that had become forsaken and this mood has never quite left me."[http://www.yankeeclassic.com/miskatonic/dliterature/authors/dunsany/bio/dunsany.htm 1]
* The [[King James Version of the Bible|King James Bible]]. In a letter to [[Frank Harris]], Dunsany wrote: "When I went to Cheam School I was given a lot of the Bible to read. This turned my thoughts eastward. For years no style seemed to me natural but that of the Bible and I feared that I never would become a writer when I saw that other people did not use it."
* The wide-ranging collection in the Library of Dunsany Castle, dating back centuries and comprising many classic works, from early encyclopedias through parliamentary records, Greek and Latin works and Victorian illustrated books
* The [[fairy tales]] of the [[Brothers Grimm]] and [[Hans Christian Andersen]].
* The work of [[Edgar Allan Poe]].&lt;ref&gt;[[S.T. Joshi]], ''Lord Dunsany: Master of the Anglo-Irish imagination''
 Greenwood Publishing Group, 1995, (p.2).&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Hiberno-English|Irish]] speech patterns
* ''The Darling of the Gods'', a stage play written by [[David Belasco]] and [[John Luther Long]], first performed 1902–1903.  The play presents a fantastical, imaginary version of Japan that powerfully affected Dunsany and may be a key template for his own imaginary kingdoms.
* [[Algernon Charles Swinburne]], who wrote the line "Time and the Gods are at strife" in his 1866 poem "[[Hymn to Proserpine]]".  Dunsany later realized this was his unconscious influence for the title ''Time and the Gods''.
*The heroic romances of [[William Morris]], set in imaginary lands of the author's creation, such as ''[[The Well at the World's End]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[David Pringle]], ''The Ultimate Encyclopedia of Fantasy'', London, Carlton, 1998. (p. 36)&lt;/ref&gt;
* Dunsany's 1922 novel ''Don Rodriguez: Chronicles of Shadow Valley'' seems to draw openly from [[Miguel de Cervantes|Cervantes]]' ''[[Don Quixote|Don Quixote de la Mancha]]'' (1605, 1615).
*Dunsany named his play ''The Seventh Symphony'' (collected in ''Plays for Earth and Air'' [1937]) after [[Symphony No. 7 (Beethoven)|Beethoven's 7th Symphony]], which was one of Dunsany's favourite works of music.&lt;ref&gt;''Lord Dunsany: Master of the Anglo-Irish Imagination (p. 152)&lt;/ref&gt; One of the last ''Jorkens'' stories returns to this theme, referring to [[Symphony No. 10 (Beethoven/Cooper)|Beethoven's ''Tenth Symphony'']].

==Writers associated with Dunsany==
* [[Francis Ledwidge]], who wrote to Dunsany in 1912 asking for help with getting his poetry published. After a delay due to a hunting trip in Africa, Dunsany invited the poet to his home, and they met and corresponded regularly thereafter, and Dunsany was so impressed that he helped with publication, and with introductions to literary society. The two became friendly and Dunsany, trying to discourage Ledwidge from joining the army when the First World War broke out, offered financial support. Ledwidge, however, did join up and found himself for a time in the same unit as Dunsany, who helped with publication of his first collection, ''Songs of the Fields,'' which was received with critical success upon its release in 1915. Throughout the war years, Ledwidge kept in contact with Dunsany, sending him poems. Ledwidge was killed at the [[Battle of Passchendaele]] two years later, even as his second collection of poetry, also selected by Dunsany, circulated. Dunsany subsequently arranged for the publication of a third collection, and later a first ''Collected Edition''. Some unpublished Ledwidge poetry and drama, given or sent to Dunsany, is still held at the Castle.
* [[Mary Lavin]], who received support and encouragement from Dunsany over many years
* [[William Butler Yeats]], who, although he rarely acted as an editor, selected and edited a collection of Dunsany's work in 1912
* Lady Wentworth, a poet, writing in a classical style, received support from Dunsany

==Writers influenced by Dunsany==
* [[H. P. Lovecraft]] was greatly impressed by Dunsany after seeing him on a speaking tour of the United States, and Lovecraft's "[[Dream Cycle]]" stories, his dark pseudo-history of how the universe came to be, and his god [[Azathoth]] all clearly show Dunsany's influence. Lovecraft once wrote, "There are my '[[Edgar Allan Poe|Poe]]' pieces and my 'Dunsany' pieces—but alas—where are my Lovecraft pieces?"&lt;ref&gt;Letter to Elizabeth Toldridge, 8 March 1929, quoted in ''Lovecraft: A Look Behind the Cthulhu Mythos''&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Robert E. Howard]] included Dunsany in a list of his favourite poets in a 1932 letter to Lovecraft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rehupa.com/bookshelf_d.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-05-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110512152338/http://www.rehupa.com/bookshelf_d.htm |archivedate=12 May 2011 |df=dmy-all }} REH Bookshelf Website.&lt;/ref&gt; Lovecraft also wrote a poem about Dunsany.

Kilby]] with a copy of ''[[The Book of Wonder]]'' as kind of a preparation to his auxiliary role in the compilation and development of ''[[The Silmarillion]]'' during the Sixties.&lt;ref&gt;"When American Clyde Kilby arrived in Oxford in the summer of 1966 to offer Tolkien "editorial assistance" in finishing The Silmarillion, one of the first things Tolkien did was hand him a copy of Dunsany's The Book of Wonder and tell him to read it before starting work on Tolkien's own story".&lt;/ref&gt; Tolkien's letters and divulged notes made allusions to two of the stories found in this volume, "[[Chu-Bu and Sheemish]]" and "The Distressing Tale of Thangobrind the Jeweller."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.conan.com/invboard/index.php?s=22017f3d5eb8ff9a904f5f53d49c1b36&amp;showtopic=1201&amp;st=60&amp;p=66377&amp;#entry66377C&lt;/ref&gt; Dale J. Nelson has argued in ''[[Tolkien Studies|Tolkien Studies 01]]'' that Tolkien may have been inspired by another of ''The Book of Wonder'''s tales, "[[The Hoard of the Gibbelins]]," while writing one of his poems, "[[The Mewlips]]," included in ''[[The Adventures of Tom Bombadil]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/176072|title=Possible Echoes of Blackwood and Dunsany in Tolkien's Fantasy|first=Dale|last=Nelson|date=21 December 2004|publisher=|volume=1|issue=1|pages=177–181|via=Project MUSE|doi=10.1353/tks.2004.0013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Guillermo Del Toro]], the filmmaker, has cited Dunsany as an influence.
* [[Neil Gaiman]] has expressed admiration for Dunsany and has written an introduction to a collection of his stories. Some commentators have posited links between ''[[The King of Elfland's Daughter]]'' and Gaiman's ''Stardust'' ([[Stardust (novel)|book]] and [[Stardust (2007 film)|film]]), a connection seemingly supported by a comment of Gaiman's quoted in ''[[The Neil Gaiman Reader]]''.
* [[Jorge Luis Borges]] included Dunsany's short story "The Idle City" in ''[[The Book of Fantasy|Antología de la Literatura Fantástica]]'' (1940, revised 1976), a collection of short works Borges selected and provided forewords for. Borges also, in his essay "Kafka and His Precursors," included Dunsany's story "Carcassonne" as one of the texts that presaged, or paralleled, Kafka's themes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cafeirreal.alicewhittenburg.com/fborges.htm|title=Cafe Irreal: Fiction: Borges|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Arthur C. Clarke]] enjoyed Dunsany's work and corresponded with him between 1944 and 1956. Those letters are collected in the book ''Arthur C. Clarke &amp; Lord Dunsany: A Correspondence''. Clarke also edited and allowed the use of an early essay as an introduction to one volume of ''The Collected Jorkens'' and that essay acknowledges the link between [[Jorkens]] and ''[[Tales from the White Hart]]''. Clarke states, humorously, that any reader who sees a link between the two works will *not* be hearing from his solicitors.
* [[Manly Wade Wellman]] esteemed Dunsany's  fiction.&lt;ref&gt;"I admire and constantly reread [[M. R. James]], Dunsany and

==Scholars and archivists==
[[S. T. Joshi]] and [[Darrell Schweitzer]] have been working on the Dunsany œuvre for over twenty years, gathering stories and essays and reference material, and producing both an initial bibliography (together) and scholarly studies of Dunsany's work (separate works).  They issued an updated version of the bibliography in 2013.  Joshi edited '''The Collected Jorkens''', '''The Ginger Cat and other lost plays''' and co-edited '''The Ghost in the Corner and other stories'''.  Both are well-known figures in the fields of speculative fiction.

In the late 1990s a curator, J.W. (Joe) Doyle, was appointed by the Dunsany estate, working at Dunsany Castle, among other things locating and organising the author's manuscripts, typescripts and other materials.  Doyle discovered both works known to exist but "lost", such as the plays "[[The Ginger Cat and Other Lost Plays|The Ginger Cat]]" and "The Murderers," some [[Jorkens]] stories, and the novel ''[[The Pleasures of a Futuroscope]]'' (subsequently published by [[Hippocampus Press]]) and unknown, unpublished works, notably including ''[[The Last Book of Jorkens]]'', to the first edition of which he wrote an introduction, and an unnamed 1956 short story collection, published as part of '''The Ghost in the Corner and other stories''' in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dunsany.net/18th_Works.htm|title=Lord Dunsany - works|website=Dunsany family official site|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2000s a PhD researcher, Tania Scott, from the [[University of Glasgow]], worked on Dunsany for some time, and has spoken at literary and other conventions.  A Swedish fan, Martin Andersson, has also been active in research and publication in the mid-2010s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hippocampuspress.com/mythos-and-other-authors/fiction/the-ghost-in-the-corner-and-other-stories-by-lord-dunsany|title=The Ghost in the Corner and Other Stories by Lord Dunsany|date=25 February 2017|publisher=Hippocampus Press|accessdate=12 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.contemporaryrhyme.com/3_1_contributors.html|title=Vol. 3  No. 1  Winter 2006 - Contributors|year=2006|publisher=contemporaryrhyme.com|accessdate=12 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notes==
Dunsany's literary rights passed from the author to a Trust, which still owns them.  These rights were first managed by Beatrice, Lady Dunsany, and are currently administered by Curtis Brown of London and partner companies worldwide (some past US deals, for example, have been listed by Locus Magazine as by SCG).

All of Dunsany's work is in copyright in parts of the world {{As of|2018|lc=on}}, including the UK and European Union, with the early work (published before 1 January 1923) being in the [[public domain]] in the United States, and  all of his work out of copyright in parts of the world with copyright durations of life + 60 or less. &lt;!--Copyright will end in Canada and many other [[life + 50]] countries at the end of 1957+50=2007, so [[as of 2008]], it would be in the public domain in large parts of the world, though the vast majority of the English-language book market will remain covered by copyright. Other notable future changes are India, currently life+60, so [[as of 2018]], then the US, which starts putting more work into the public domain in 2019, and then the vast majority of the world which is either life+70 or protects only for the term in the original country which is life +70 and thus 2028. A few Dunsany works are protected for longer periods in some territories, notably most of the contents of the ''Last Book of Jorkens'', and some short stories published on the Dunsany website or otherwise by the family in the early 2000s--&gt;

Dunsany's primary home, over 820 years old, can be visited at certain times of year, and tours usually include the Library, but not the tower room he often liked to work in. His other home, Dunstall Priory, was sold to a [[Fan (person)|fan]], [[Grey Ruthven, 2nd Earl of Gowrie|Grey Gowrie]], later head of the Arts Council of the UK, and thence passed on to other owners; the family still own farm- and down-land in the area, and a Tudor cottage in Shoreham village. The grave of Lord Dunsany and his wife can be seen in the Church of England graveyard in the village (most of the previous barons are buried in the grounds of Dunsany Castle).

Dunsany's original manuscripts are collected in the family archive, including some specially bound volumes of some of his works.  As noted, there has been a curator since the late 1990s and scholarly access is possible by application.

'''Elena Delle Donne''' ({{IPAc-en|ᵻ|ˈ|l|eɪ|n|ə|_|ˌ|d|ɛ|l|i|_|ˈ|d|ɒ|n}}; born September 5, 1989) is an American professional [[basketball]] player for the [[Washington Mystics]] of the [[Women's National Basketball Association]] (WNBA).

==Early life==
The daughter of a real estate developer and his wife,&lt;ref name=Hays/&gt; Delle Donne inherited her 6'5" (1.96 m) height from both her parents—her father, who played college golf,&lt;ref name=Audacity&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/espn/feature/story/_/page/espnw-delledonne161122/chicago-sky-elena-delle-donne-spent-years-learning-accept-height |title=The Audacity of Height |first=Taffy |last=Brodesser-Akner |publisher=''ESPN.com'' |date=November 22, 2016 |accessdate=December 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; is 6'6" (1.98 m), and her mother is 6'2" (1.88 m).&lt;ref name=Ain&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/wnba/story/_/page/bodyelenadelledonne/chicago-sky-star-elena-delle-donne-talks-free-throws-endurance-dunking-espn-body-issue |title=Delle Donne on battling Lyme disease and her biggest inspiration |first=Morty |last=Ain |publisher=''[[ESPN The Magazine]]'' |date=July 6, 2016 |accessdate=December 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her childhood was marked by a struggle to come to terms with her unusual height. According to a 2016 ESPN story, her first memory was going on a shopping trip when she was 3 years old and hearing other shoppers tell her mother that an 8-year-old should not be using a pacifier. In third grade, her class was assigned to measure themselves using lengths of paper; she "was humiliated" when her paper extended well beyond those of her classmates. Within two years of that incident, a doctor wanted to start her on injections to stunt her growth; her mother refused. By the time she was in eighth grade, she was already 6'0" (1.83 m). Additionally, according to the same ESPN piece, Delle Donne had to come to terms with having "a body that could do a great many things that the body of her older sister, Lizzie, couldn't." Lizzie was born deaf and blind, is unable to speak, and also has [[cerebral palsy]] and [[autism]].&lt;ref name=Audacity/&gt; In another 2016 ESPN story, Delle Donne credits her mother with helping her accept her height:&lt;ref name=Ain/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;She's 6–2 and my dad is 6–6, so she understood. She was like, "I'm telling you, one day you are going to realize how beautiful your height is." She would always tell me how unique I am and say, "Why try to be like the rest of the pack? Be your own person."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==High school career==
[[File:Elena Delle Donne basketball.jpg|thumb|left|130px|Delle Donne playing for Ursuline Academy in Delaware]]

Delle Donne gained national recognition as a high school basketball star at [[Ursuline Academy (Delaware)|Ursuline Academy]] in [[Wilmington, Delaware]]. She led Ursuline to three straight Delaware State Championship titles and was ranked as the number-one overall high school recruit by [[Scout.com]] as well as a [[McDonald's All-American]].&lt;ref name="girlshoops"/&gt; She was the first and only student at Ursuline so far to score 2,000+ points during her high school career and also set the girls' high school national record for consecutive free throws made (80) in 2005–2006.&lt;ref name="Free throw record"/&gt;

Delle Donne was also named a [[Women's Basketball Coaches Association|WBCA]] All-American.&lt;ref name="WBCA box score"/&gt; She participated in the 2007 WBCA High School All-America Game, where she scored 17 points,&lt;ref name="WBCA box score"/&gt; and earned MVP honors for the Red team.&lt;ref name="WBCA HS MVP"/&gt;

She also participated in volleyball. Delle Donne won the volleyball DIAA state championship with Ursuline in 2007. She posted a season high 20 kills against [[Padua Academy|Padua]] during a game involving the number one and two teams in the state.

==College career==
[[File:Elena Delle Donne.jpg|thumbnail|right|200px|Delle Donne playing for the University of Delaware]]
Following an outstanding prep career during which she became the most highly touted women's basketball recruit since [[Candace Parker]], Delle Donne received a basketball scholarship from the [[Connecticut Huskies women's basketball|University of Connecticut]]. However, in early June 2008, Delle Donne abruptly dropped out of Connecticut's summer school program after just two days in [[Storrs, Connecticut|Storrs]]. Delle Donne was very close to her family, especially her older sister, Lizzie, who has [[cerebral palsy]] and is [[blindness|blind]] and [[deaf]]. She was not ready to be separated from her family.&lt;ref name=Farnum/&gt; Gene, Elena's brother and the middle child of the Delle Donne family, would say in a 2012 ESPN story on his younger sister:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Her relationship with Lizzie is huge. It's so close. It's a big reason why she is such a homebody who came home from UConn, because she craves to be around Lizzie and to experience Lizzie grabbing her and sniffing her and just spend quality time with her.&lt;ref name=Hays/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A week after leaving Connecticut, Delle Donne said by telephone from her home in Wilmington that she has "a lot of personal issues to fix. Only my family understands what's going on. Right now I am going to take a long personal break."&lt;ref name="break"/&gt; She took a similar break prior to the 2007–08 season in high school.&lt;ref name="hsbreak" /&gt;

On August 16, 2008, Delle Donne announced she would not accept the scholarship due to [[Burnout (psychology)|burnout]], and instead decided to enroll at the [[University of Delaware]] and join their volleyball team as a [[Walk-on (sports)|walk-on]].&lt;ref name=volleyball/&gt; She played middle hitter at UD for the 2008–09 season.&lt;ref name="EED joins Volleyball team"/&gt; The 2008 Delaware Blue Hens finished their season with a record of 19–16. They were 9–5 in their conference ([[Colonial Athletic Association]]) and won the conference tournament. They earned a spot in the NCAA Tournament, but lost to [[University of Oregon|Oregon]] in the first round.&lt;ref name="Media Guide"/&gt; Delle Donne did not continue on the volleyball team in 2009, but joined the basketball team.

On June 2, 2009, Delle Donne announced that she would play basketball for the Blue Hens in the 2009–10 season as a redshirt freshman.&lt;ref name="Elena Delle Donne Biography"/&gt; In 2012, ESPN writer Graham Hays said about her return to the sport "it cannot be complete coincidence that it came the year Gene returned to Delaware and went to work for his dad's company."&lt;ref name=Hays/&gt; In a 2016 interview with ESPN, Delle Donne also recalled a trip she took during the summer of 2009 to the school that Lizzie was attending. While there, she met another woman at the school, a basketball fan who used a wheelchair due to cerebral palsy, who told her, "Elena, do everything you can with your abilities, just like we do."&lt;ref name=Audacity/&gt;

Delle Donne had a very productive freshman season. She averaged 26.7 points per game, the third-highest of all Division I women's basketball players.&lt;ref name="FreshmanPPG"/&gt; She scored 54 points in a loss against [[James Madison Dukes|James Madison]] on February 18, 2010, which was the highest single-game point total by any Division I female basketball player that season.&lt;ref name="Stats"/&gt; She was named the CAA Rookie of the Week six times, and the player of the week once during 2009–10.&lt;ref name="ROW"/&gt;

She was voted the CAA's "Player of the Year" and "Rookie of the Year" in women's basketball by CAA coaches, sports information directors and media. This was the first time a player had won both awards in one year since Old Dominion's [[Lucienne Berthieu]] did so in 1999. No men's player has ever won both awards in the same season.&lt;ref name="CAAPOY"/&gt;
 
In her sophomore season, the team started off well, but then Delle Donne began to develop flu-like symptoms. In a game against [[Penn State Lady Lions basketball|Penn State]], she asked to be taken out of the game, something she had never done before. After many tests, the doctors finally diagnosed her with [[Lyme disease]]. She struggled the rest of the season, but she helped her team reach the finals of the conference tournament and an invitation to the [[2011 Women's National Invitation Tournament|Women's NIT]].&lt;ref name=Farnum/&gt; 

As a junior, Delle Donne led the nation in scoring, finishing the season with an average of 28.1 points per game. Her prowess attracted many fans to the Blue Hens games, with attendance rising 250 percent from the previous year.&lt;ref name="ESPN"/&gt; On February 16, 2012, Delle Donne scored 42 points in a win over [[Hofstra Pride women's basketball|Hofstra]], eclipsing the 2,000 point mark for her career. Delaware were the CAA champions, qualifying for the [[2012 NCAA Women's Division I Basketball Tournament]]. Delle Donne scored 39 out of the Blue Hens' first 56 points in their first round victory over [[Little Rock Trojans women's basketball|UALR]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scores.espn.go.com/ncw/recap?gameId=320780048 |title=Elena Delle Donne pours in 39 as Delaware rolls |publisher=ESPN |date=March 18, 2012 |accessdate=November 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Delaware would lead by halftime against [[Kansas Jayhawks women's basketball|Kansas]] in the next game, but despite Delle Donne's 34 points, the Jayhawks still won.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scores.espn.go.com/ncw/recap?gameId=320800048 |title=Angel Goodrich, defense propel Kansas to Sweet 16 over Elena Delle Donne, Blue Hens |publisher=ESPN |date=March 21, 2012 |accessdate=November 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

During the 2012–13 season, Delle Donne again fought Lyme disease, missing four games due to the illness.  Delle Donne returned on December 12 against [[Maryland Terrapins women's basketball|Maryland]] and led the team with 19 points and 6 rebounds in a 69–53 loss. This game was the largest crowd (5,089) to ever to see a women's basketball game at the [[Bob Carpenter Center]], the Blue Hens' homecourt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bluehens.com/teams/womens-basketball/stories/2012/december/122012a.html |title=Blue Hen Winning Streak Snapped as #9/8 Maryland Pulls Away Late for 69–53 Victory |publisher=BlueHens.com |date=December 20, 2012 |accessdate=April 17, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130410212705/http://www.bluehens.com/teams/womens-basketball/stories/2012/december/122012a.html |archivedate=April 10, 2013  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Delle Donne led her team in scoring in 22 regular season games during her senior season, as well as in rebounds in 12 games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bluehens.com/sportsinfo/womens_basketball/2013Stats/teamcume.htm |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130410161011/http://www.bluehens.com/sportsinfo/womens_basketball/2013Stats/teamcume.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=April 10, 2013 |title=Delaware&amp;nbsp;– Season Statistics |publisher=Bluehens.com |year=2013 |accessdate=April 17, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; She scored more than 30 points on five occasions, leading her team to a 27–3 regular season record entering CAA conference tournament play.

After winning the CAA conference tournament, the Blue Hens were the #6 seed in their region of the [[2013 NCAA Women's Division I Basketball Tournament]]. Delle Donne led them to victories over #11 [[West Virginia Mountaineers women's basketball|West Virginia]] and #3 [[North Carolina Tar Heels women's basketball|North Carolina]]. The Blue Hens then lost to #2 [[Kentucky Wildcats women's basketball|Kentucky]], despite Delle Donne's 33 points.

==WNBA career==
[[File:Elena Delle Donne 2015.jpg|thumbnail|left|200px|Delle Donne at Madison Square Garden, in the Chicago Sky's win over the New York Liberty.]]
Following her collegiate career, Delle Donne was selected second overall in the [[2013 WNBA Draft]] by the [[Chicago Sky]], a team that went 14–20 in the 2012 season. She was one of twelve players to be invited to the event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://www.bluehens.com/teams/womens-basketball/stories/2013/april/041113a.html |title=Elena Delle Donne Headlines List of Top College Prospects Invited to |publisher=University of Delaware |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130425055102/http://www.bluehens.com/teams/womens-basketball/stories/2013/april/041113a.html |archivedate=April 25, 2013  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Delle Donne scored 22 points in her debut against fellow rookie [[Brittney Griner]] and the [[Phoenix Mercury]]. The Sky went on to win the game, 102–80.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scores.espn.go.com/wnba/recap?gameId=400445722 |title=Chicago Sky vs. Phoenix Mercury – Recap |publisher=ESPN |date=May 27, 2013 |accessdate=August 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; She led all players in votes for the [[2013 WNBA All-Star Game]], the first time a rookie has done so in league history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.wnba.com/rookie_elena_delle_donne_top_v_2013_07_18.html |title=Rookie Elena Delle Donne Top Vote Getter in 2013 WNBA All-Star Balloting Presented by Boost Mobile |publisher=WNBA |date=July 18, 2013 |accessdate=August 13, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130803203544/http://www.wnba.com/rookie_elena_delle_donne_top_v_2013_07_18.html |archivedate=August 3, 2013  }}&lt;/ref&gt; She missed the game, however, due to a concussion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/wnba/story/_/id/9511551/2013-wnba-all-star-game-elena-delle-donne-replaced-erika-de-souza |title=2013 WNBA All-Star Game – Elena Delle Donne replaced by Erika de Souza |publisher=ESPN |date=July 26, 2013 |accessdate=August 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the All-Star break, Delle Donne returned to action, and continued to play at a high level. The Sky qualified for the playoffs for the first time in franchise history, earning the top seed in the Eastern Conference. Delle Donne was rewarded with the 2013 Rookie of the Year award.

The 2014 regular season had Delle Donne playing only 16 games due to a flare-up of [[Lyme disease]], averaging less than 19 minutes in the final seven games. Eventually she rose up during the playoffs, helping the Sky defeat the [[Atlanta Dream]] in the first round, scoring 34 points and a game winning shot with 8.2 seconds left as the Sky erased a 17-point deficit with 8:12 remaining in the deciding game. However, Delle Donne was elbowed while going for a rebound in the Atlanta series, suffering a back injury that reduced her play time in the following round against the [[Indiana Fever]]. The Sky still got to the WNBA finals, where they lost to the Phoenix Mercury. Delle Donne played only 10 minutes in the first game, before taking medication to play 68 minutes and score 45 points over the final two games.&lt;ref name=wc&gt;{{cite web|first=Kevin |last=Tresolini |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/wnba/sky/2014/09/24/elena-delle-donne-offseason-rehab-home-delaware/16191011/ |title=Elena Delle Donne hopes home cooking will be the cure |work=USA Today |date=September 25, 2014 |accessdate=November 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/wnba/story/_/id/13011355/chicago-sky-need-elena-delle-donne-more-ever |title=Sky need big year from Delle Donne |publisher=ESPN |date=June 2, 2015 |accessdate=November 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Delle Donne has played in two [[NBA All-Star Celebrity Game]]s, in [[2014 NBA All-Star Game|2014]] and [[2016 NBA All-Star Game|2016]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/basketball/ct-elena-delle-donne-reunites-with-kevin-hart-for-nba-all-star-celebrity-game-20160114-story.html |title=Elena Delle Donne reunites with Kevin Hart for NBA All-Star Celebrity Game |work=Chicago Tribune |date=January 14, 2016 |accessdate=November 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2016 season, Delle Donne averaged 21.5 ppg helping the Sky to another [[playoff berth]] as they finished 18–16. With the WNBA's new playoff format in effect, the Sky were the #4 seed in the league with a bye to the second round. Unfortunately, Delle Donne had suffered an injury on her right [[thumb]] in a loss to the [[Washington Mystics]]. Delle Donne would have season-ending surgery that would also keep her out for the playoffs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ellentuck |first=Matt |url=https://www.sbnation.com/2016/9/12/12894680/elena-delle-donne-injury-thumb-surgery-playoffs |title=WNBA star Elena Delle Donne to undergo thumb surgery just before the playoffs |publisher=SBNation.com |date=September 12, 2016 |accessdate=November 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/wnba/story/_/id/17621380/thumb-injury-sidelines-chicago-sky-elena-delle-donne-second-round-playoffs |title=Thumb injury sidelines Chicago Sky's Elena Delle Donne for second round of playoffs |publisher=ESPN |date=September 23, 2016 |accessdate=November 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Delle Donne played 28 games in the season before the injury. Without Delle Donne, the Sky still had a decent playoff run, advancing to the semifinals (the last round before the WNBA finals) where they lost 3–1 to the [[Los Angeles Sparks]] who would win the championship.

With Delle Donne approaching restricted free agent status and her rookie contract expiring, she was traded to the [[Washington Mystics]] in exchange for [[Stefanie Dolson]], Kahleah Copper and the second overall pick in the [[2017 WNBA draft]] just a couple days before the start of free agency.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bleacherreport.com/articles/2690204-elena-delle-donne-to-mystics-latest-trade-details-comments-and-reaction ELENA DELLE DONNE TO MYSTICS: LATEST TRADE DETAILS, COMMENTS AND REACTION]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2018 season, with Meesseman sitting out the season to play for Team Belgium in the FIBA World Tournament, Delle Donne would play at the power forward position in the starting lineup. On June 13, 2018, Delle Donne scored a season-high 36 points in a 95–91 victory over the Connecticut Sun.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thenewstribune.com/sports/article213145409.html Mystics blow 30-point lead, then rally past Sun, 95–91]&lt;/ref&gt; After scoring 23 points in a 77–80 loss to the [[Atlanta Dream]], Delle Donne became the fastest player in WNBA history to score 3,000 points, completing the feat in 148 games.

By the end of regular season, Delle Donne averaged 20.7 ppg. The Mystics were the number three seed with a 22–12 record, receiving a bye to the second round elimination game.

The Mystics would end up winning the series in a hard-fought five-game series, advancing to the WNBA Finals for the first time in franchise history.

== Overseas career ==
Unlike the vast majority of WNBA players, Delle Donne has not normally played overseas, choosing instead to spend the traditional basketball season in the U.S. to help care for her sister, Lizzie.&lt;ref name=tribune&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theplayerstribune.com/elena-delle-donne-sister/|author=Delle Donne, Elena |title=Lizzie: Letter to my Younger Sister|work=The Players Tribune |date=August 12, 2015 |accessdate=February 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her first experience in an overseas league did not come until 2017, when she signed a short-term deal to play with the [[Women's Chinese Basketball Association|Chinese]] team [[Shanxi Xing Rui Flame|Shanxi]] in that league's playoffs. Her stay in China prematurely ended when a flare-up of Lyme disease forced her to return to the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.espn.com/wnba/story/_/id/18552312/elena-delle-donne-heading-back-us-china-lyme-disease-flare-up |title=Elena Delle Donne returning to U.S. after Lyme disease flare-up |publisher=''ESPN.com'' |agency=Associated Press |date=January 25, 2017 |accessdate=February 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gennady Alferenko''' (Russian: Генна́дий Петро́вич Алфере́нко; born December 15, 1948) is a Soviet and Russian social innovator; in 1970 he established ''Terpsichore'', the first local community organization registered as a [[legal personality|legal entity]] in the [[USSR]]; in 1985 he established the [[Foundation for Social Inventions]] of the USSR, and in 1987, the foundation for Social Innovations USA. Alferenko is an Honorary Citizen of [[New Orleans]], [[San Francisco]], [[San Diego]], [[Atlanta]], [[Juneau]], and [[Seattle]].

==Education and career==
Gennady Alferenko studied [[Geology]] and [[Geophysics]] at the [[Novosibirsk State University]] from 1966 through 1973. During this period, in 1970, Alferenko founded Terpsichore, a [[ballet]] club, which was the first local [[community organization]] registered as a [[legal personality|legal entity]] in the [[USSR]]. Terpsichore organized events with performances of Soviet and world culture stars, such as [[Galina Ulanova]], [[Maya Plisetskaya]], [[Ekaterina Maximova]], [[Alicia Alonso]], [[Vladimir Vasiliev (dancer)|Vladimir Vasiliev]], [[Maris Liepa]], and [[Mikhail Baryshnikov]]. Also, he established a network of 450 local foundations to provide financial, organizational, and legal support to youth initiatives across the Soviet Union. From 1973 through 1985 Gennady Alferenko headed the NSU's oil and gas deposits research team in [[Eastern Siberia]] and on [[Sakhalin]] island.

In 1985, following Alferenko's publication on an idea of a national campaign to facilitate innovators and change-makers, [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] pledged his support and invited Gennady to Moscow to set up a national fund promoting social innovations. Alferenko established the [[Foundation for Social Inventions]] at the [[Komsomolskaya Pravda]] newspaper, as a readers' voluntary association, to implement initiatives facilitating creation and establishment of an open [[civil society]].&lt;ref name="annewhite"&gt;{{cite book |last=White |first=Anne |date= 1999 |title=Democratization in Russia Under Gorbachev, 1985-91: The Birth of a Voluntary Sector |url= |location= |publisher=[[Palgrave Macmillan]] |pages=8, 99–101 |isbn= 0333747755}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Foundation for Social Inventions established and provided organizational and financial support to over 300 non-governmental organizations using a unique mandate to launch new organizations under its auspices. Some of the initiatives that Gennady Alferenko launched with the FSI, were Siberia-Alaska in 1988, and [[Space Flight Europe-America 500]] in 1992.

Siberia-Alaska was a project to establish a [[Visa (document)|visa]]-free travel regime for native families in order to reunite Soviet and American [[Yupik peoples|Yupik]] Eskimos in [[Chukotka Autonomous Okrug|Chukotka]], and open direct flights between Siberia, Russian Far East, Alaska and California. Before, those who wished to travel legally across the [[Bering Strait]] had to go round the world.

[[Space Flight Europe-America 500|Europe-America 500]] was the first ever [[private spaceflight]] which was conceived with the aim to promote the use of technology once reserved for military forces. It was followed by a Russian-American [[entrepreneur]] exchange program promoting development of small and medium-sized businesses in Russia. During the course of the program, over 10.000 young unemployed people had been sent for 4-6-week internships in the United States for developing entrepreneurial skills and gaining experience.

In 1987, Gennady Alferenko established the US Foundation for Social Innovations, which, jointly with the FSI of the USSR, launched the first student exchange programs between the USSR and the USA for 100.000 students, and organized a meeting of the [[Vietnam War]] US veterans and [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|Afghanistan War]] Soviet veterans to develop mutual support programs and establish joint business ventures, such as manufacturing of [[prosthetics]] and [[wheelchair]]s.

In 1989, Alferenko together with the Esalen Institute organized [[Boris Yeltsin]]'s first trip to the United States, arranging meetings for Yeltsin with President [[George H. W. Bush]], Vice President [[Dan Quayle]], National Security Advisor [[Brent Scowcroft]], former President [[Ronald Reagan]], and many other leaders in business and government. The trip covered eleven cities and fulfilled Yeltsin's dreams of seeing the [[Statue of Liberty]] and an example of a free enterprise economy.

In mid-1990s, Alferenko had developed recommendations for Prime Minister [[Yevgeny Primakov]] to establish a state-owned company [[Rosneft]]. At the time, he had also been a founder and president of the club of friends of the [[Bolshoi Theatre]].

In 2000, Alferenko organized Ring-2000, a civic initiative to create a National idea bank for the new President of Russia, [[Vladimir Putin]]. The main events were held in Russia concert hall in Moscow linked with 33 Internet centers in universities across Russia, and were broadcast on national TV.

Since 2000, Gennady Alferenko has been a member of board of directors of [[Standard Bank]], a board member of Valery Gergiev Charitable Foundation, and strategic advisor to national and international companies such as [[Gazprombank]], [[Ernst &amp; Young]], [[DLA Piper]], and [[PwC]]. In 2016, he became a member of the board of directors at Hancock Jaffe Laboratories, a U.S. based company developing bioprosthetic medical devices providing treatments for cardiothoracic procedures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hancockjaffe.com/about/ |title=About Hancock Jaffe Laboratories}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Albert Hadley Cantril, Jr.''' (16 June 1906 – 28 May 1969) was a [[Princeton University]] [[psychologist]] who expanded the scope of the field.

Cantril made "major contributions in psychology of propaganda; public opinion research; applications of psychology and psychological research to national policy, international understanding, and communication; developmental psychology; psychology of social movements; measurement and scaling; humanistic psychology; the psychology of perception; and, basic to all of them, the analysis of human behavior from the transactional point of view."&lt;ref name=Kilp/&gt; His influence is felt in education, law, philosophy, politics and psychiatry.&lt;ref name=Kilp/&gt;

"Hadley Cantril, Princeton psychologist, is representative of most quantitative scholars of social influence who, while holding their political commitments close to the vest, nevertheless saw themselves clearly in the ranks of reformers loosely attached to the [[progressive movement]]…. Focus on social process and a psychological view of people put the academic scientists of society in a frame of mind to assume the [[polis]] languished chiefly because of inaction on the part of enlightened administrators."&lt;ref name=Spl/&gt;{{rp|74}}

==Biography==
Cantril was born in [[Hyrum, Utah]] in 1906 and first studied at [[Dartmouth College]], graduating [[Bachelor of Science]] in 1928. He did graduate study in Munich and Berlin, then studied at [[Harvard]] graduating with [[Doctor of Philosophy]] in [[psychology]] in 1931. He was hired as an instructor by Dartmouth and joined the [[Princeton University]] faculty in 1936. The next year he became president of the [[Institute for Propaganda Analysis]] and one of the founding editors of ''[[Public Opinion Quarterly]]''. Later be became chairman of the [[Princeton University Department of Psychology]].&lt;ref name=Kilp&gt; F. P. Kilpatrick (November 1969) "Hadley Cantril – The Transactional Point of View", [[Journal of Individual Psychology]] 25: 219–25, reprinted as Epilogue, pages 229–34, in Albert H. Cantril, editor (1988) ''Psychology, Humanism and Scientific Inquiry'', [[Transaction Books]] {{ISBN|0-88738-176-6}} &lt;/ref&gt;

Cantril was a member of the [[Radio Project|Princeton Radio Research Project]]. The Project looked at the reaction to Orson Welles' [[The War of the Worlds]] and published a study accenting the public's disturbance.&lt;ref&gt;Hadley Cantril, Hazel Gaudet, and [[Herta Herzog]] (1940) ''The Invasion from Mars: A Study in the Psychology of Panic: with the Complete Script of the Famous Orson Welles Broadcast'', [[Princeton University Press]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1940 he served as a consultant to the [[Office of the Coordinator of Inter-American Affairs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
|title=Investigation of un-American propaganda activities in the United States|year=1940|pages=3244|quote= and a special consultant for the Office of the Coordinator of Inter- American Affairs|publisher=United States Government Printing Office}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Cantril's later psychological work included collaboration with [[Adelbert Ames, Jr.]] developing a [[transactional analysis|transactional]] method for studying human perception, as well as other research in [[humanistic psychology]].&lt;ref name="PubOpin"/&gt;{{rp|389–90}}

==Public opinion research==
Though trained as a psychologist, Cantril's most important work concerned the then-new topic of [[public opinion]] research. Influenced initially  by the success of [[George Gallup]] and [[Elmo Roper]] during the [[1936 presidential election]], Cantril sought to apply their systematic [[opinion poll|poll]]ing technique to academic [[social psychology]].&lt;ref name="PubOpin"/&gt;{{rp|388}} While Cantril was department chairman he became a [[presidential advisor]]:&lt;blockquote&gt;Cantril's small-scale program at Princeton became more extensive in September 1940 when [[Nelson Rockefeller]], [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|FDR]]'s Coordinator of Inter-American Affairs, asked the Princeton psychologist to "set up mechanisms which would gauge public opinion in [[Latin America]]." In cooperation with [[George Gallup|Gallup]], and with funds from the [[FEMA|Office of Emergency Management]], Cantril established an ostensibly independent research organization, American Social Surveys. He recruited his friend [[Leonard Doob]], and another researcher [[Lloyd A. Free|Lloyd Free]], to analyse Nazi propaganda coming into Latin America. Through Rockefeller's office, the results of Cantril's program were brought to the attention of FDR. The president asked Cantril to monitor public sentiment on avoiding war verses aiding Britain. Cantril duely kept tabs on views about aiding England and on the public's willingness to change U.S. neutrality laws in favor of Britain.&lt;ref name="Spl"&gt;J. Michael Sproule (1997) ''Propaganda and Democracy'', page 184, [[Cambridge University Press]] {{ISBN|0-521-47022-6}} &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;In 1942 Cantril conducted a small-sample survey of [[Vichy France|Vichy]] officials in Morocco, prior to [[Operation Torch]], that revealed the intensity of the anti-British sentiment of the French forces there. This information influenced the disposition of forces during the operation, with American troops landing near Casablanca and mixed forces at Oran and Algiers.&lt;ref name="PubOpin"&gt;John Gray Geer (2004) ''Public opinion and polling around the world: a historical encyclopedia'', Volume 1, [[ABC-CLIO]] {{ISBN|9781576079119}} &lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|389}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

|author=Stuart Oskamp, P. Wesley Schultz
|publisher=Routledge
|year=2005
|isbn=0-8058-4769-3
|pages=314}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

In 1955 he and Lloyd Free founded the Institute for International Social Research (IISR).&lt;ref name="NYTobit"/&gt; The IISR was often asked by United States government agencies to conduct small-sample public opinion polls in foreign countries.&lt;ref&gt;"Worldwide Propaganda Network Built by the C.I.A." ''New York Times'', December 26, 1976&lt;/ref&gt; Notably, Cantril and Free conducted a poll of Cuba during 1960 demonstrating great support for [[Fidel Castro]], which was overlooked during the [[United States presidential transition|presidential transition]] between Eisenhower and [[John F. Kennedy|Kennedy]] and read only after the [[Bay of Pigs Invasion]] fiasco.&lt;ref name="NYTobit"&gt;"Lloyd A. Free, 88, is dead; Revealed Political Paradox", [[New York Times]], November 14, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Cantril's most-cited work is ''The Pattern of Human Concerns,'' notable for the development of the [[self-anchoring scale]] (also known as "Cantril's Ladder").&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gallup.com/poll/122453/understanding-gallup-uses-cantril-scale.aspx Understanding How Gallup uses the Cantril Scale] from [[Gallup (company)|Gallup]]&lt;/ref&gt; Cantril and Free also first discovered the paradox that American voters tend to oppose "big government" in general while supporting many specific liberal [[Social programs in the United States|social program]]s.&lt;ref name="NYTobit"/&gt;

During the late 1950s, Cantril served on the International Objectives and Strategies panel of the Rockefeller Brothers Fund's [[Special Studies Project]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==Career==
Habibi was tasked by [[Ayatollah Khomenei]] to draft the prospective constitution of Iran when the latter was in exile in [[Paris]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Akhavi|first=Shahrough|title=The Thought and Role of Ayatollah Hossein'ali Montazeri in the Politics of Post-1979 Iran|journal=Iranian Studies|year=2008|volume=41|issue=5|pages=645–666|doi=10.1080/00210860802518301|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00210860802518301|accessdate=19 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; His version was heavily modified due to criticisms and the final text was approved by the election in November 1979.&lt;ref name=dae/&gt;

Following [[Iranian Revolution|the Iranian revolution]], Habibi was named public spokesman for [[Revolutionary council of Islamic revolution of Iran|the revolutionary council]].&lt;ref name=rubin80&gt;{{cite book|last=Rubin|first=Barry|title=Paved with Good Intentions|year=1980|publisher=Penguin Books|location=New York|page=284|url=http://www.gloria-center.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Paved-with-Good-Intentions-final.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was among the main architects of the first draft of [[Politics of Iran|Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Iran]], which was later passed for more discussion to an elected [[Assembly of Experts for Constitution]].&lt;ref name=ptv1/&gt; The assembly made significant changes in the original draft, e.g. by introducing the new position of "leader of the Islamic Republic" based on [[Khomeini]]'s concept of [[Guardianship of the Islamic Jurists]], which gave almost unlimited power to the clergy. The modified version was approved in a popular referendum in 1979.

'''Isaac A. Van Amburgh''' (1808–1865) was an American [[animal trainer]] who developed the first trained wild animal act in modern times.&lt;ref name="Culhane pg. 20"&gt;Culhane, John.  ''The American Circus,'' Henry Holt and Company, Inc., 1990., pg. 20&lt;/ref&gt;  By introducing jungle acts into the circus, Van Amburgh paved the way for combining [[menagerie]]s with [[circus|circuses.]]  After that, menageries began using equestrian and [[clown]] performances in circus rings.  Gradually the distinction between circus and menagerie faded.&lt;ref name="Culhane pg. 17"&gt;Culhane, John.  ''The American Circus,'' Henry Holt and Company, Inc., 1990., pg. 17&lt;/ref&gt;

From the humble beginning of cage-cleaner in the Zoological Institute of New York, Van Amburgh quickly gained notoriety for his acts of daring, for example placing his bare arm and even head inside the jaws of a wild cat.&lt;ref name="History"&gt;''History Magazine,'' "Step Right Up," October/November 2001 issue http://www.history-magazine.com/circuses.html.&lt;/ref&gt;  Also known for his domineering attitude toward his animals, he earned the title “The Lion King.”&lt;ref name="Culhane pg. 17" /&gt;

Despite the disapproval of some for his brutal treatment of animals, Van Amburgh remained very popular and successful, beginning his own menagerie which he took to Europe.  He died a wealthy man, and his name continued to be used in the circus world for more than a century after.&lt;ref name="Culhane pg. 149"&gt;Culhane, John.  ''The American Circus,'' Henry Holt and Company, Inc., 1990., pg. 149&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early Life and Beginnings of Career==
Isaac A. Van Amburgh (a name adopted by his American Indian grandfather) was born on May 26, 1808 in [[Fishkill (town), New York|Fishkill, New York.]]&lt;ref name="Culhane pg. 20" /&gt;  Legend dictates that while reading the Bible, young Isaac came upon the tale of [[Book of Daniel|Daniel]] in the lion’s den, and, from then on, was determined to be a lion tamer.&lt;ref name="Rose"&gt;Johnson, William M., ''The Rose-Tinted Menagerie'' (http://www.iridescent-publishing.com/rtm/ch1p3.htm).&lt;/ref&gt;  He found his start in the Zoological Institute of New York.

===Zoological Institute of New York===

At nineteen, Isaac left his home in [[Peekskill, New York]] to look for a job in neighboring [[North Salem, New York|North Salem.]]&lt;ref name="Culhane pg. 20" /&gt;  There he found a job as a cage cleaner in the Zoological Institute of New York.&lt;ref name="Bunyan"&gt;{{Harvtxt|Bunyan|1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite its lofty-sounding name, the Zoological Institute was not a zoo at all, but rather a tiny traveling menagerie.&lt;ref name="Bunyan" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Culhane pg. 16" /&gt;  In a period of time when amusement was regarded with suspicion, it was from its name that this show got its value.&lt;ref name="Culhane pg. 16"&gt;Culhane, John.  ''The American Circus,'' Henry Holt and Company, Inc., 1990., pg. 16&lt;/ref&gt;

Although he started out as a "cage boy," Isaac showed an aptitude for training the wild animals whose cages he cleaned.&lt;ref name="Culhane pg. 20" /&gt;  One of the owners of the Zoological Institute, Titus, was a dealer in wild animals.  So he appreciated the novelty of trained wild animals, recognizing that "novelty plus publicity meant money."&lt;ref name="Culhane pg. 20" /&gt;

June, Titus, and Angevine distributed posters by the thousands.  They put Isaac in costume – a Roman toga, in reference to the gladiators of ancient Rome's [[Circus Maximus]].  In the winter, Van Amburgh trained his wild animals in the barns of New York's upper Westchester and the lower Putnam counties.  The next year, 1821, the Van Amburgh Menagerie hit New York City.

==The Lion King==

[[Image:Menagerie.amburgh.1838.jpg|thumb|alt=Van Amburgh stands with his foot on a lion.|Isaac van Amburgh (1808–1865) by T. C. Wilson 1838 in National Portrait Gallery, London''.]]

In 1833, at age twenty-two, Isaac A. Van Amburgh entered a cage of wild cats at the Zoological Institute.&lt;ref name="Culhane pg. 20" /&gt;  In the cage were a lion, a lioness, leopard, leopardess, black-maned Cape lion, and a panther.&lt;ref name="Virginia"&gt;#“Circus in America” © to Lavahn G. Hoh and the University of Virginia, 2004 http://www.circusinamerica.org/public/timelines?date1=1825&amp;date2=1871&lt;/ref&gt; From the Richmond Hill Theatre, New York, Van Amburgh astonished the country.&lt;ref name="Culhane pg. 20" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Virginia" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Michigan"&gt;Central Michigan University, Mount Pleasant, Mich. 48859, January 13, 2011, http://clarke.cmich.edu/resource_tab/information_and_exhibits/rides_and_spangles_michigan_circuses_and_carnivals/lion_tamers.html&lt;/ref&gt;  In the words of his biographer, "The effect of his power was instantaneous.  The Lion halted and stood transfixed.  The Tiger crouched.  The Panther with a suppressed growl of rage sprang back, while the Leopard receded gradually from its master.  The spectators were overwhelmed with wonder .... Then came the most effective tableaux of all.  Van Amburgh with his strong will bade them come to him while he reclined in the back of the cage – the proud King of animal creation."&lt;ref name="Ferguson"&gt;Ferguson, O. J.  ''Biographical Sketch of I. A. Van Amburgh.''  Booth &amp; Co., 1865.&lt;/ref&gt;

Van Amburgh did more than just enter the cage.  [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]] described a menagerie he saw on September 4, 1828, near North Adams, Massachusetts: “A man put his arm and head into the lion’s mouth, – all the spectators looking on so attentively that a breath could not be heard.  That was impressive, – its effect on a thousand persons, – more than the thing itself.”&lt;ref name="Hawthorne"&gt;Hawthorne, Nathaniel.  Passages from the American Note-Books of Nathaniel Hawthorne.  Boston: Houghton, Mifflin, 1898.  Entry for September 4, 1838.&lt;/ref&gt;  As Van Amburgh was one of the few performers of the time to perform this way, Hawthorne probably saw{{clarify|date=September 2018|reason=Is there some reason to think that he didn't seenit in person? Especially given such a specific description?  Would he sometimes write as if he was there about 2nd hand experiences?  Or does the sentence mean saw as in met with afterwards?}} Van Amburgh.&lt;ref name="Culhane pg. 21"&gt;Culhane, John.  ''The American Circus,'' Henry Holt and Company, Inc., 1990., pg. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;  In fact, Van Amburgh is usually credited with being the first man ever to put his head into the mouth of a lion.&lt;ref name="Rose" /&gt;  In July 7, 1838, the [[New York Mirror]] also described how Van Amburgh’s “fearless acts of placing his bare arm moist with blood, in the lion’s mouth and thrusting his head into the distended jaws of the tiger”  were watched with keen interest.&lt;ref name="Virginia" /&gt;

===Van Amburgh's Menagerie===

Van Amburgh, made an instant hero, discovered he now had the freedom to make his own decisions.&lt;ref name="Rose" /&gt;  By entering lions’ dens in and out of the country, he began earning real money.&lt;ref name="Rose" /&gt;  Featured in the “Flatfoot shows,” he was able to earn up to four hundred dollars per week.&lt;ref name="Culhane pg. 20" /&gt;  By age twenty-three, he had his own [[travelling menagerie]], and by the mid-1840s his was the largest traveling show in England.&lt;ref name="Rose" /&gt;  In 1861, it was one of America’s eleven big traveling shows.&lt;ref name="Culhane pg. 66"&gt;Culhane, John, 1990 ‘’The American Circus,’’ pg. 66.&lt;/ref&gt;

Even after the 1868 fire that killed Van Amburgh’s animals and destroyed other circus artifacts, the potent name of Van Amburgh continued to be used by circuses until 1922.&lt;ref name="Culhane pg. 97"&gt;Culhane, John, 1990 ‘’The American Circus,’’ pg. 97.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Culhane pg. 13"&gt;Culhane, John, 1990 ‘’The American Circus,’’ pg. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

===London and Queen Victoria===

[[Image:Landseer.amburgh.jpg|thumb|''Isaac van Amburgh with his Animals'' by Sir [[Edwin Henry Landseer]] ]]

In the late 1830s, Van Amburgh took his act to England and Europe for several years.&lt;ref name="Virginia" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Thayer"&gt;Thayer, Stuart. ‘‘American Circus Anthology, Essays of the Early Years,’’ arranged and edited by [[William L. Slout]].  Copyright © 2005 by Stuart Thayer and William L. Slout.&lt;/ref&gt;  He made his debut in London at Astley’s on August 27, 1838, and his said to have made £300 per week there.&lt;ref name="Culhane pg. 24"&gt;Culhane, John, 1990 ‘’The American Circus,’’ pg. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;

While in England, Van Amburgh performed for [[Queen Victoria]] and [[Albert, Prince Consort|Prince Albert]] in 1844.&lt;ref name="Culhane pg. 55"&gt;Culhane, John, 1990 The American Circus, pg. 55.&lt;/ref&gt;  The former took special interest in him.  In fact, the Queen commissioned artist [[Edwin Henry Landseer|Edwin Landseer]] to paint a portrait of Van Amburgh and his cats.&lt;ref name="Virginia" /&gt;  Upon its completion, the painting was exhibited at the Royal Academy, an impressive honor for the time.&lt;ref name="Culhane pg. 24" /&gt;

In 1839, Queen Victoria traveled six times in as many months solely to watch Van Amburgh perform at [[Drury Lane]].&lt;ref name="Culhane pg. 24" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Culhane pg. 39"&gt;Culhane, John, 1990 ‘’The American Circus,’’ pg. 39.&lt;/ref&gt; She even remained after one evening’s performance in order to watch his feeding the cats.&lt;ref name="Culhane pg. 39" /&gt;  Even before his 1838 European debut, Van Amburgh was one of America’s most celebrated characters.  But after such special royal favor, Van Amburgh “became a figure that even the American upper crust could admit to appreciating.”&lt;ref name="Culhane pg. 39" /&gt;  He was the first major American wild animal trainer to achieve such an international celebrity status.&lt;ref name="Michigan" /&gt;

==Criticisms==

[[Image:Menagerie.amburgh.lions.JPG|400px|right|Van Amburgh in the Wild Cat Cage]]

Circuses were regularly under attack in the press and at the pulpit as “traveling death” and “moral ruin.” &lt;ref name="Culhane pg. 31"&gt;Culhane, John, 1990 ‘’The American Circus,’’ pg. 31.&lt;/ref&gt;   But predecessors of Van Amburgh were less inhumane.&lt;ref name="Thayer2"&gt;‘‘Band Wagon,’’ “The Keeper Will Enter the Cage: Early American Wild Animal Trainers,” November–December 1982.&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite his great success and popularity, Van Amburgh regularly faced criticism for the cruelty he showed to his animals.&lt;ref name="Culhane pg. 31" /&gt; Van Amburgh reportedly beat his animals with a crowbar.&lt;ref name="History" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Virginia" /&gt;  In costume, whether in loose-fitting jungle clothing or ancient Roman gladiatorial garb, Van Amburgh would bait the animals, attempting to evoke as much ferocity on their part as he could.&lt;ref name="History" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Rose" /&gt;  Thereupon, he would beat them into submission.  “His ‘‘piece de resistance’’ was forcing the lions to ... lick his boots as the ultimate sign of his conquest and the animals’ abject subservience.”&lt;ref name="Rose" /&gt;  Van Amburgh’s own publicity agent, Hyat Frost, reported that Van Amburgh starved his lions for three days before one of these royal command performances.  They were so hungry when it came time to perform that he was forced to “lash them furiously with his whip ‘into the most abject and crouching submission.’”&lt;ref name="Rose" /&gt;

In response to these attacks, Van Amburgh cited Bible verses to justify his touring menagerie.&lt;ref name="History" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Culhane pg. 31" /&gt;  He quoted [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 1:26, arguing that God had given men dominion over animals.  Thus “it was a religious act for trained animals to kneel at his feet.”&lt;ref name="Culhane pg. 31" /&gt;  He is also well-remembered for having acted out a scene from the Bible by forcing a lion and a lamb to lie down together and even inviting a child from the audience into the den.&lt;ref name="History" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Culhane pg. 31" /&gt;

==Death and legacy==
In August 1838, the editor of the ''Age'' reported that “there have already been several cases in which lions have snapped off the heads of persons persisting in this sort of foolish experiment.”&lt;ref name="Culhane pg. 24" /&gt;   Van Amburgh, however, was one of the few early lion tamers who died in bed.  On November 29, 1865, at age fifty-four, Isaac A. Van Amburgh suffered a fatal heart attack in Philadelphia.  He died a very wealthy man.&lt;ref name="Culhane pg. 24" /&gt;

Even after Van Amburgh's death, Hyatt Frost, his manager since 1865, continued using the Van Amburgh name.&lt;ref name="Culhane pg. 24" /&gt;  From him it was leased by the [[Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus|Ringling Brothers]] in 1889.&lt;ref name="Culhane pg. 149"/&gt;

Van Amburgh himself lived to hear his deeds put to a popular song, “The Menagerie.”  Dr. W. J. Wetmore, M.D., published “Van Amburgh’s Menagerie” in 1865, which began like this:&lt;ref name="Song"&gt;https://jscholarship.library.jhu.edu/handle/1774.2/14693
.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Van Amburgh is the man, who goes to all the shows''

''He goes into the lion's cage, and tells you all he knows;''

''He sticks his head in the lion's mouth,and keeps it there a-while,''

''And when he pulls it out again, he greets you with a smile.''

chorus:

''The elephant now moves round, the music begins to play.''

''Them boys around the monkey’s cage had better keep away”

'''James Oatley Snr''' (c. 1769–1839) was a [[Great Britain|British]]-born [[History of Australia (1788–1850)|colonial Australian]] watch and clock maker and one-time [[convict]]. Oatley, allegedly from [[Stafford]] and aged 44, was sentenced to [[penal transportation]] for life at [[Hampshire]] [[Assizes]] on 7 March 1814. James had a number of convictions, dating back to 1806, when he had stolen one ton of cheese. He was sent to Australia for stealing shirts and bedding: ''Hampshire Chronicle'' Monday 14 March 1814 p3 [6, 7, 8, 16]

==Life in colonial Sydney==
Oatley arrived in [[Sydney, New South Wales]] on 27 January 1815 on board the ''Marquis of Wellington'' [7, 10]. On 25 October 1821, he was given a conditional pardon. In this record, James is mentioned as a "native of Warwickshire", and a physical description is also provided; he is described as being pale, with dark brown hair, grey eyes, 5'5", and "stout" (with the remainder of the instrument of pardon being difficult to read) [7, 8, 10].

Oatley was awarded several land grants; in 1831 and on 30 October 1832, 24 December 1833, 23 January 1834, and 27 July 1835. Areas covered by these land grants include Snugborough (in the vicinity of the modern Moorefields Road, [[Kingsgrove, New South Wales|Kingsgrove]]), which he farmed, and Needwood Forest (now [[Hurstville Grove, New South Wales|Hurstville Grove]]). In total, the land approximately covered is similar to that now bounded by Canterbury Road, [[Belmore, New South Wales|Belmore]], to the north, King George Road to the west, Kingsgrove Road to the east, and the [[Georges River]] to the south [15].

==Death==
James Oatley died on 9 October 1839. His death notice in the ''Sydney Monitor'' gives his age as 72 years; the Parish record of his burial gives James' age as 70 years. James was buried on his property, ''Snugborough'' [3, 4, 5, 16].

==Legacy==
Oatley and his family's legacy has been reflected via geography. In 1903, the [[southern Sydney]] suburb of [[Oatley]] was named after the family. Prior to that, the area west of the railway line was known as New Oatley's, which was a sub-district of Hurstville, and Oatley Platform; east of the railway line was known as Oatley's, which was a sub-district of Kogarah. In 1905, Frederick Street, Oatley, named after Frederick Stokes Oatley, was constructed as the main street of the new suburb [12].

Oatley Street, [[Woollahra, New South Wales|Woollahra]], lying between Ocean Street and Edgecliffe Street, existed in the 1850s and early 1860s. Frederick Stokes Oatley resided between Ocean Street and Oatley Street, Woollahra [12].

Oatley Lane, Oatley Street, and Oatley Road, all of which were named after James Oatley Jnr, existed in East Sydney. Oatley Road extended into [[Paddington, New South Wales|Paddington]]. A remnant of Oatley Road still exists in Paddington, running beside the [[Victoria Barracks, Sydney|Victoria Barracks]] [12, 13].

The original Oatley land between Moorefields Road and the railway line through Kingsgrove Station remained largely as open paddocks until it was subdivided for housing and industry in the early 1970s. A street off Kingsgrove Road was named after James Oatley. Just north of Moorefields Road are Robert Street and Eleanor Avenue [13].

==Personal life==
The personal life of James Oatley was well documented in the 1825 Muster of New South Wales [2] and in his will [1] [see Talk]. Oatley married twice. In England, he married Sarah Bennett [see Talk]. Little is known about this marriage. James than had a de facto relationship with Mary Stokes, his housekeeper [2]. Mary was the mother of his three sons,  James Stokes Jnr [1], Frederick Stokes [1] and George (1820–1821) shown as James' children in the 1825 Muster [2, 3, 4, 5] and each described in James' will as "my adopted son" [1]. Mary arrived in Sydney on 8 June 1815 on board the ''Northampton'', with her son, then called James [but later renamed Robert], born during the voyage [14]. The 1825 muster clearly indicates that Robert was Mary's child, but not James' child [2]. Robert was described as "an adopted child" in James' will [1].  
After Mary's death, Oatley married Mary Ann Bogg in 1833 [1, 3, 4].

===Children===
*'''Marianne/Marion Oatley''' (c1808-22 March 1866): died as Mrs Borrett [New South Wales Marriage Index; New South Wales Death Index; death notice [ [[Sydney Morning Herald]] 23 March 1866] [3, 4, 5, 16]  [see Talk].
*'''[[James Oatley (New South Wales politician)|James Oatley]]''' (1817–1878) was a coach builder and  engineer by trade [3, 4]. James Stokes Oatley Jnr assumed responsibiility for running the family farm after Oatley Snr's death [11]. The farm was later sold and James became an innkeeper (also described as licensee and victualler) [12] until he entered the [[Parliament of New South Wales|NSW Parliament]] [12] as a Member of the [[New South Wales Legislative Assembly|Legislative Assembly]] in 1868.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/prod/parlment/members.nsf/ec78138918334ce3ca256ea200077f5d/596805948a5d5832ca256e4c0019ed14!OpenDocument&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://nla.gov.au/nla.cs-pa-HTTP%253A%252F%252FWWW2.PHOTOSAU.COM%252FCITYOFSYDNEY%252FSCRIPTS%252FEXTSEARCH.ASP%253FSEARCHTERM%253D005736&lt;/ref&gt; James married Eleanor Johnson (also known as Ellen, Helena, and Emily), with whom he had eight children. After Eleanor's death, James married Margaret Curtis, with whom he had one daughter [3, 4, 5, 16].
*'''Frederick Stokes Oatley''' (1819–1890) was a watchmaker and Inspector of Abattoirs [12, 19]. Frederick married Jane Weedon, with whom he had twelve children [3, 4, 5, 16]. James Snr gave to Frederick his watchmaking business in George Street, Sydney, and Needwood Forest [1, 12]. By the 1860s, Frederick had given up the watchmaking business; and, in 1881, he sold {{convert|300|acre|km2}} of Needwood Forest.
*'''Robert Oatley''' (1815–1876) was adopted by James Oatley, but not his biological child [1, 3, 4, 5].  Robert, a cooper by trade, was born at sea ''en route'' to Sydney and was initially named James [4, 14]. After his name change and legal adoption by James Oatley, Robert was baptized about a year after his arrival in Sydney [3, 4, 5]. Robert did not marry.

===Other descendents of Oatley Snr===
*'''Gwen Ruth Oatley''' (1918–24 December 2000) was the granddaughter of James Oatley Jnr's second son, Frederick [3, 4, 5, 16]. Gwen was awarded an OAM in 1978 for services to the Australian film industry. Her obituary was published in the ''Sydney Morning Herald'' on 25 January 2001 [5].
*'''Frederick "Dudley" Weedon Oatley''' (1884–28 March 1919) was the grandson of Frederick Stokes Oatley [3, 4, 5, 16]. Frederick was a Lieutenant-Colonel in the [[First Australian Imperial Force|Australian Imperial Force]] and served in World War One [17, 18]. When he died, Frederick was given a funeral on 30 March 1919 with [[Military funeral|full military honours]] [5]. Frederick actually died from a massive hydatid cyst in his thoracic cavity, compressing his heart and lungs and resulting in widespread gangrene (Death Certificate) [3, 4, 5].

'''Joseph Neil "Joey" Moss''' (born September 25, 1963) is the [[locker room]] attendant for the [[Edmonton Oilers]] of the [[National Hockey League]] and the [[Edmonton Eskimos]] of the [[Canadian Football League]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.edmontonsun.com/2013/09/13/winnifred-stewarts-empties-for-winn-program-growing-each-year |title=Happy 50th Birthday: Joey Moss' impact on Winnifred Stewart's Empties for Winn program |first=Catherine |last=Griwkowsky |work=[[Edmonton Sun]] |date=2013-09-25 |accessdate=2018-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Born with [[Down syndrome]], Moss caught the eye of Oilers centre [[Wayne Gretzky]] in 1985, when Gretzky was dating Moss' sister, [[Vikki Moss|Vikki]]. Impressed with the dedication Moss brought to a job at an Edmonton bottle depot, Gretzky suggested to team general manager [[Glen Sather]] that the young man be given a tryout.

As the summer of 1986 came around, Gretzky was worried that Joey would lose everything he had learned with the Oilers, so Gretzky called up the equipment manager of the [[Edmonton Eskimos]], [[Dwayne Mandrusiak]], and asked him if Joey could work with them during training camp. Gretzky even offered to pay Joey's wages for the team.

Moss' career with the Oilers long outlasted Gretzky's, and his determination and passion for hockey have made him a nationwide celebrity and a major symbol of continuity within the franchise. (In 2006, during a surprising Oiler playoff run, he delayed elective surgery for a [[hernia]] in order to see the [[2006 Stanley Cup playoffs|Stanley Cup playoffs]] through to the finish.) His main duties with the team include cleaning, handling towels and water, and running errands for former equipment manager Lyle "Sparky" Kulchisky.

== Awards and recognition ==
In 2003, Moss received the NHL Alumni Association's "Seventh Man Award" in recognition of outstanding behind-the-scenes service to the league. The Joey Moss Cup, a trophy contended for by Oilers players in an annual split-squad game near the end of training camp, is named after him.

Moss' dedication to the Edmonton Eskimos and the Oilers was recognized when a mural was unveiled on October 20, 2008 on 99th Street in Edmonton. He was recognized again on November 14, 2012 with the [[Queen Elizabeth II Diamond Jubilee Medal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://alberta.ca/diamondjubileemedal.cfm |title=Queen Elizabeth II Diamond Jubilee Medal honours |work=[[Executive Council of Alberta|Government of Alberta]] |accessdate=2012-12-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130925211941/http://alberta.ca/diamondjubileemedal.cfm |archivedate=2013-09-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; ([http://video.oilers.nhl.com/videocenter/console?catid=4&amp;id=189704&amp;lang=en Video of the Ceremony])  On May 29, 2015, Moss was inducted into the [[Alberta Sports Hall of Fame and Museum|Alberta Sports Hall of Fame]].

'''John Langdon''' (June 26, 1741{{spaced ndash}}September 18, 1819) was a politician from [[Portsmouth, New Hampshire]], and a [[Founding Father of the United States]]. He served as a delegate to the [[Philadelphia Convention|Constitutional Convention]], signed the [[United States Constitution]], and was one of the first two [[United States senator]]s from that state.

As a member of the [[Continental Congress]] Langdon was an early supporter of the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]]. He later served in [[United States Congress]] for 12 years, including as the first [[President pro tempore of the United States Senate|president pro tempore]] of the Senate, before becoming [[governor of New Hampshire]]. He turned down a nomination for [[Vice President of the United States|Vice Presidential]] candidate in 1812.

==Biography==
===Early years===
Langdon's father was a prosperous farmer and local ship builder whose family had emigrated to America before 1660 from [[Sheviock]], [[Caradon]], [[Cornwall]].  The Langdons were among the first to settle near the mouth of the [[Piscataqua River]], a settlement which became [[Portsmouth, New Hampshire|Portsmouth]], one of [[New England]]'s major [[seaport]]s. Langdon attended the local grammar school run by a veteran of the 1745 [[Siege of Louisbourg (1745)|Siege of Louisbourg]] against the [[France|French]] at [[Fortress Louisbourg]] in [[New France]]. After finishing his primary education, he served an [[apprentice]]ship as a clerk. He and his older brother, [[Woodbury Langdon]], rejected the opportunity to join pop in their father's successful agricultural livelihood and apprenticed themselves to local naval merchants instead.

===To sea===
By age 22, Langdon was [[Captain (nautical)|captain]] of a [[cargo ship]] called the ''Andromache,'' sailing to the [[West Indies]]. Four years later he owned his first [[Cargo ship|merchantman]], and would continue over time to acquire a small fleet of vessels engaging in the [[triangular trade#New England|triangle trade]] between Portsmouth, the [[Caribbean Sea|Caribbean]], and [[London]].{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} His older brother was even more successful in international trade, and by 1777 both young men were among Portsmouth's wealthiest citizens.

===As revolutionary===
British control of the shipping industries greatly hurt Langdon's business, motivating him to become a vigorous and prominent supporter of the revolutionary movement in the 1770s. He served on the New Hampshire [[Committee of Correspondence]] and a nonimportation committee, and also attended various [[Patriot (American Revolution)|Patriot]] assemblies. In 1774, he participated in the seizure and confiscation of British [[munition]]s from [[Fort William and Mary]].

Langdon served as a member of the [[Second Continental Congress]] from 1775 to 1776. He resigned in June 1776 to become agent for the Continental forces against the [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] and superintended the construction of several warships including the ''[[USS Raleigh (1776)|Raleigh]]'', the ''[[USS America (1782)|America]]'', and the ''[[USS Ranger (1777)|Ranger]]'', which was captained by [[John Paul Jones]]. In 1777, he equipped an expedition against the British, participating in the [[Battle of Bennington]] and commanding [[Langdon's Company of Light Horse Volunteers]] at [[Battle of Saratoga|Saratoga]] and in [[Battle of Rhode Island|Rhode Island]].

===Founding father===
[[Image:Portsmouth, NH - Governor John Langdon House.JPG|thumb|left|[[Governor John Langdon House]], Portsmouth, New Hampshire]]
In 1784 he built at Portsmouth the mansion now known as the [[Governor John Langdon House]]. Langdon was elected to two terms as [[Governor of New Hampshire#History|President of New Hampshire]], once between 1785 and 1786 and again between 1788 and 1789. He was a member of the [[Congress of the Confederation]] in 1787 and became a delegate to the [[Constitutional Convention (United States)|Constitutional Convention]] in 1787, serving as a member of the New Hampshire delegation. Langdon was elected to the U.S. Senate and served from March 4, 1789 to March 3, 1801. He was elected the first President pro tempore of the Senate on April 6, 1789, and also served as president pro tempore during the second Congress.

During the 1787 constitutional debates in Philadelphia, Langdon spoke out against [[James Madison]]'s proposed "negative" on state laws simply because he felt that should the Senate be granted this power and not the House of Representatives, it would "hurt the feelings" of House members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/debates_710.asp|title=Avalon Project – Madison Debates – July 10|publisher=|accessdate=July 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Dubious|date=November 2013}}

In 1798, Langdon assisted [[Oney Judge]] to evade [[Burwell Bassett]],  the nephew of [[George Washington|George and]] [[Martha Washington]], who had intended to kidnap Judge and return her to slavery with the Washingtons.&lt;ref name=Gerson&gt;[http://seacoastnh.com/blackhistory/ona.html Eva Gerson, "Ona Judge Staines: Escape from Washington"], 2000, ''Black History'', SeacoastNH&lt;/ref&gt;

===New Hampshire statesman===
Langdon later served as a member of the [[New Hampshire Legislature]] (1801–05), with the last two terms as [[speaker (politics)|speaker]]; he served as [[governor of New Hampshire|governor]] from 1805 to 1812, except for a year between 1809 and 1810. In 1808, his niece, Catherine Whipple Langdon, married [[Edmund Roberts (diplomat)#Early life|Edmund Roberts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=  http://www.accessgenealogy.com/scripts/data/database.cgi?file=Data&amp;report=SingleArticle&amp;ArticleID=0001473 |title=  Calvin Howard Bell Family |author=   |authorlink=   |date=  April 23, 2012 |format=   |work=  extract from Bell Family History |publisher=  Access Genealogy |accessdate=  April 19, 2012 |quote=  Judge Woodbury Langdon, of Portsmouth, N.

===Legacy===
The town of [[Langdon, New Hampshire]] is named after him,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gannett|first=Henry|title=The Origin of Certain Place Names in the United States|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9V1IAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA181|year=1905|publisher=U.S. Government Printing Office|page=181}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as Langdon Street in [[Madison, Wisconsin]], a town with numerous streets named after founding fathers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wisconsinhistory.org/odd/archives/002071.asp|title=Wisconsin Historical Society|publisher=|accessdate=July 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''joiner''' is an [[artisan]] who builds things by [[Woodworking joint|joining]] pieces of [[wood]], particularly lighter and more ornamental work than that done by a [[Carpentry|carpenter]], including [[furniture]] and the "fittings" of a house, ship, etc.&lt;ref&gt;"joiner, n. 2. a." ''Oxford English Dictionary''. 2nd. ed. 2009. CD-rom.&lt;/ref&gt; Joiners may work in a workshop, because the formation of various joints is made easier by the use of non-portable, powered machinery, or on job site. A joiner usually produces items such as interior and exterior doors, windows, stairs, tables, bookshelves, cabinets, furniture, etc. In shipbuilding a ''marine joiner'' may work with materials other than wood such as linoleum, fiberglass, hardware, and gaskets.&lt;ref&gt;''Canadian Classification and Dictionary of Occupations''. 6th ed. Ottawa: Employment and Immigration Canada, Occupational and Career Information Branch, 1971. 756. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

The terms ''joinery'' and ''joiner'' are used in the UK, and the main trade union for American carpenters still calls itself the [[United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners of America]].

In the UK, an apprentice of wood occupations could choose to study ''bench joinery'' or ''site carpentry and joinery.'' Bench joinery is the preparation, setting out, and manufacture of joinery components while site carpentry and joinery focus on the installation of the joinery components, and on the setting out and fabrication of timber elements used in [[construction]].

The '''Kangani system''' was a form of labour recruitment and organisation in parts of Southeast Asia under British colonial rule, generally in operation from the early 19th century until the early 20th century, specifically the areas now known as [[Colonial Burma|Myanmar]], [[British Malaya|Malaysia]], and [[British Ceylon|Sri Lanka]]. The system was similar to [[indentured servitude]] and both were in operation during the same period, with the kangani system becoming more popular from late 19th century onward. Under the kangani system, recruitment and management were taken up by people called the ''kangani'' (from the Tamil word for foreman), who directly recruited migrants from India- especially South India in Tamil-majority areas- via networks of friends, family and other contacts, with that same person  then responsible for the supervision of the labourers he recruited. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Amarjit |last=Kaur |title=Southeast Asia: An Historical Encyclopedia from Angor Wat to East Timor |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QKgraWbb7yoC |year=2004 | publisher=ABC-CLIO |isbn=1576077705 |pages=639, 641}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The leader of these groups of immigrants had considerable control over their affairs and generally forced them to enter debt-bondage relationships by illegally deducting their wages. In smaller groups they might work as labourers themselves in addition to their other responsibilities but in larger groups their role was more one of organisation, supervision and dealing with the landowner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Raj Sekhar |last=Basu |title=Nandanar's Children: The Paraiyans' Tryst with Destiny, Tamil Nadu 1850 - 1956 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4NeGAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA111 |year=2011 |publisher=SAGE |isbn=978-81-321-0679-1 |pages=111, 119}}&lt;/ref&gt;  With certain estimates showing that nearly 1 in 8 Indian labourers in Burma was a kangani, some have argued that stepping into the role of recruiter and supervisor, with its accompanied rise in income and status, was a relatively achievable form of social mobility among the labourers of the plantations&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=39lJz_L4MdUC|title=Rising India and Indian communities in East Asia|last=|first=|date=2008|publisher=Institute of Southeast Asian Studies|others=Kesavapany, K.,, Mani, A.,, Ramasamy, P.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3367">According to the [[Book of Mormon]], '''Mosiah I''' ({{IPAc-en|m|oʊ|ˈ|s|aɪ|.|ə|,_|-|ˈ|z|aɪ|.|ə}})&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/pronunciation?lang=eng LDS.org: "Book of Mormon Pronunciation Guide"] (retrieved 2012-02-25), [[Wikipedia:IPA for English|IPA]]-ified from «mō-sī´a ''or'' mō-zī´a»&lt;/ref&gt; was a Nephite prophet who led the Nephites from the [[land of Nephi]] to the land of [[Zarahemla]] and was later appointed king. He was the father of [[King Benjamin]] and the first of two individuals in the [[Book of Mormon]] with the name Mosiah. His grandson, [[King Mosiah II|Mosiah II]] was Benjamin's son and was king of the Nephite nation from about 124 BC to 91 BC.

==Accounts==
The history of Mosiah I is limited to [[Amaleki]]'s account in the [[Book of Omni]].&lt;ref&gt;{{sourcetext|source=Book of Mormon|book=Omni|chapter=1|verse=12|range=-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following a period of "much war and contention between...the Nephites, and the Lamanites",&lt;ref&gt;{{sourcetext|source=Book of Mormon|book=Omni|chapter=1|verse=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mosiah&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; was "warned of the Lord that he should flee out of the land of Nephi, and as many as would hearken unto the voice of the Lord should also depart out of the land with him, into the wilderness".&lt;ref&gt;{{sourcetext|source=Book of Mormon|book=Omni|chapter=1|verse=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The journey led them to the land of Zarahemla, inhabited by a [[Mulekites|group of people]] who had come from Jerusalem at the "time that Zedekiah, king of Judah, was carried away captive into Babylon".&lt;ref&gt;{{sourcetext|source=Book of Mormon|book=Omni|chapter=1|verse=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two groups united and appointed Mosiah their king.

Mosiah I also translated engravings found on a stone which gave an account of the [[Jaredite]]s, another people who had previously inhabited the area.

== Possible origin of the name ==
[[Hugh Nibley]] relates the name to a combination of the name [[Moses]] with that of [[Yahweh]] (Jehovah).&lt;ref&gt;[[Hugh Nibley|Nibley, Hugh]] &amp; Hummel, Sharman Bookwalter (ed.) ''Nibley's Commentary on the Book of Mormon, Vol. 1'' (2013), ASIN: B00GFY0GUO&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Egyptian language|Egyptian]] root ''msy'', "child of", has been considered as a possible etymology for the name Moses, arguably an abbreviation of a [[theophoric name]], as for example in Egyptian names like [[Thutmose]]s ([[Thoth|Thoth created him]]) and [[Ramesses I|Ramesses]] ([[Ra|Ra created him]]),&lt;ref name="Hays" &gt;Christopher B. Hays, [https://books.google.it/books?id=r5W7BwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA116 ''Hidden Riches: A Sourcebook for the Comparative Study of the Hebrew Bible and Ancient Near East''], Presbyterian Publishing Corp, 2014 p. 116.&lt;/ref&gt; with the god's name omitted. In the case of Mosiah, the inversion of the elements could yield the combination "son of Yah".

The name is also similar to [[Isaiah]] in the [[Hebrew Bible]], and the "-iah" suffix can be found in a number of Book of Mormon names such as [[Amalickiah]] and [[Sariah]], as well as the Biblical names [[Jeremiah]] and [[Zedekiah]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25509">The following is a list of burial places attributed to Biblical personalities according to various religious and local traditions. The locations listed are not based on factual evidence, but rather locations mentioned in the text of the Bible or oral traditions of indigenous peoples. [[Lebanon]], [[Israel]], the [[Palestinian territories]], [[Iraq]], [[Jordan]] and [[Iran]] have put monuments on the grave locations in an attempt to preserve them as holy sites. Many sites have been transmitted from generation to generation and there are historical accounts from travellers which state their existence.

|[[David's Tomb]], [[Mount Zion]], Jerusalem
|[[File:King david tomb.jpg|100px]]
|{{Bibleref2|1 Kings 2:10}} says that King David was buried in his own city; the [[City of David]] is on the southeastern hill of Jerusalem, Mount Zion is its western hill. The "tomb" is a [[Crusades|Crusader]]-era [[cenotaph]] (symbolical, empty [[sarcophagus]]). The building dates to the 2nd century CE the earliest, and the tradition of David being buried here was created by Byzantine Christians well over a millennium after his supposed death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Holy Land: An Oxford Archaeological Guide from Earliest Times to 1700 |series=Oxford Archaeological Guides |author=Jerome Murphy-O'Connor |year=2008 |location=Oxford |publisher=Oxford University Press |pages=116–117 |isbn=978-0-19-923666-4 |quote= |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=cSuErBFmykQC&amp;pg=PA117&amp;dq=%22Beneath+the+present+floor+of+the+Tomb+of+David%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjDms7__8zOAhXK7RQKHQQlCIoQ6AEIHDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Beneath%20the%20present%20floor%20of%20the%20Tomb%20of%20David%22&amp;f=false |accessdate=19 August 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

|Mosque of Nabi Matta: The main mosque in Beit Ummar housing the tomb of Nabi Matta or Amittai, father of Jonah. [[Mujir al-Din al-'Ulaymi|Mujir ad-Din]] writes that Matta was "a holy man from the people of the house of the prophecy." Nearby Halhul houses the tomb of Jonah with the inscription reading "Yunus ibn Matta" or "Jonah son of Amittai", confirming that Matta is indeed the Arabic name for Amittai and the Beit Ummar tomb is dedicated to Amittai. In 1226, the Ayyubid sultan al-Mu'azzam built a mosque with a minaret under the supervision of Jerusalem governor Rashid ad-Din al-Mu'azzami. The Mamluks constructed some additions to the mosque and engraved several inscriptions on its surface.

French journalist '''[[Jean-Dominique Bauby]]''' suffered a [[stroke]] in December 1995. When he awoke 20 days later, he found his body was almost completely paralyzed; he could control only his left eyelid (as the other was sewn shut to prevent an infection). By blinking this eye, he slowly dictated one alphabetic character at a time and, in so doing, was able over a great length of time to write his memoir, ''[[The Diving Bell and the Butterfly]]''; the memoir was adapted to the screen in a [[The Diving Bell and the Butterfly (film)|namesake 2007 movie]]. Three days after the book was published in March 1997, Bauby died from [[pneumonia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://film.avclub.com/the-diving-bell-and-the-butterfly-1798203488 |title=The Diving Bell And The Butterfly |first=Tasha |last=Robinson |date=November 29, 2007 |work=The A.V.

With his family's help he continued to write poems and sermons for his congregation, letter by letter, by blinking. He has since regained his ability to breathe by himself and speak. He describes his experiences as a blessing and a spiritual revelation of body and mind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://rabbicahana.wordpress.com/ |title=Rabbi Ronnie Cahana |access-date=November 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; His story was told in a [[Ted Talk]] given by his daughter called "[https://www.ted.com/talks/kitra_cahana_my_father_locked_in_his_body_but_soaring_free My father, locked in his body but soaring free]".

In early 2010, Dr. [[Steven Laureys]], Houben's neurologist, admitted that subsequent tests had demonstrated Houben had not actually been communicating via the facilitator, and ''[[Der Spiegel]]'', which had originally "quoted" many of Houben's facilitated statements, retracted those quotes as being inauthentic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/neurological-rescue-mission-communicating-with-those-trapped-within-their-brains-a-677537.html |title=Communicating with Those Trapped within Their Brains |first=Manfred |last=Dworschak |location=DE |work=Der Spiegel |date=February 13, 2010 |access-date=November 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Laureys maintained the [[Magnetic resonance imaging|MRI]] data that had led him to diagnose Houben as locked-in still suggested he was conscious.

==Julia Tavalaro==
In 1966, '''Julia Tavalaro''', then aged 32, suffered two strokes and a brain hemorrhage and was sent to Goldwater Memorial Hospital on [[Roosevelt Island, New York]]. For six years, she was believed to be in a [[vegetative state]]. In 1972, a family member noticed her trying to smile after she heard a joke. After alerting doctors, a speech therapist, Arlene Kratt, discerned cognizance in her eye movements. Kratt and another therapist, Joyce Sabari, were eventually able to convince doctors she was in a locked-in state. After learning to communicate with eye blinks in response to letters being pointed to on an alphabet board, she became a poet and author. Eventually, she gained the ability to move her head enough to touch a switch with her cheek, which operated a motorized wheelchair and a computer. She gained national attention in 1995 when Richard E. Meyer of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' published a cover story about Tavalaro. In 1997, Erika Duncan's profile of Tavalaro and her co-author Richard Tayson, "Decades After Silence, a Voice Is Recognized," ran in the Long Island edition of ''[[The New York Times]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/01/19/nyregion/decades-after-silence-a-voice-is-recognized.html |title=Decades After Silence, A Voice Is Recognized |first=Erika |last=Duncan |date=January 19, 1997 |access-date=November 22, 2018 |newspaper=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in April 1997, "The Long Road Home" appeared in ''Newsday''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The Long Road Home |newspaper=Newsday |date=April 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tavalaro appears with Richard Tayson on ''Dateline NBC'' and Melissa Etheridge's Beyond Chance (Lifetime).

==Christine Waddell==
'''Christine Waddell''' is Britain's longest survivor of locked-in syndrome, which left her in a state of constant paralysis, but awareness. At the age of 26 in April 1997, she fell in her bathroom. She tried to get up but ultimately fell again and lay there for three days – until a colleague noticed her absence from work and her father broke into her [[Apartment|flat]]. Seventeen months in the hospital followed before she moved in with her parents. After years of suffering she was given a grant for a computer which allows her to communicate. She is now able to use the Internet and to communicate with old friends and others who have locked-in syndrome. She also listens to music and audiobooks, is able to swallow melted chocolate, and sometimes has occasional vodka via her feeding tube. She misses most the ability to talk and regrets being unable to eat burgers. In 2013 she ate for the first time in 17 years. She now stands with less support, reaching on a bench, holding her head up alone, and can ride a stationary bike in physiotherapy.&lt;ref name=amazing_spirit&gt;{{cite news |first=Jenna |last=Sloan |url=https://www.thesun.co.uk/archives/reallife/906764/im-mad-on-facebook-shopping-50-shades-of-grey-and-i-like-vodka/ |title=I'm mad on Facebook, shopping, 50 Shades of Grey and I like vodka |newspaper=The Sun |date=September 11, 2012 |access-date=November 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Magnes the shepherd''', sometimes described as '''Magnes the shepherd boy''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=The Daily Herald|url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/44791889/|page=23|title=Compasses Invented by Chinese|date=November 6, 1975}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a mythological figure, possibly based on a real person, who was cited by [[Pliny the Elder]] (23 CE – 79 CE) as discovering [[Natural remanent magnetization|natural magnetism]]. His name, "Magnes", the Latin word for ''[[magnetite]]'', has been attributed as the origin of the Latin [[Root (linguistics)|root]] that has passed into English, giving its speakers the words ''[[magnet]]'', ''[[magnetism]]'', the mentioned ore, and related formulations. Other authorities have attributed the word origin to other sources.

As set out in Pliny's ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Naturalis Historia]]'' ("Natural History"), an early [[encyclopedia]] published c. 77&amp;nbsp;CE – c. 79&amp;nbsp;CE,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Roos|first=Anna Marie|title=The Correspondence of Dr. Martin Lister (1639–1712). Volume One: 1662–1677|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aByoBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA87|year=2015|publisher=[[Brill Publishers]]|location=Leiden, Netherlands|isbn=978-90-04-26332-1|page=87}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as translated from the Latin in [[Robert Jacobus Forbes]]' ''Studies in Ancient Technology'', Pliny wrote the following (attributing the source of his information, in turn, to [[Nicander|Nicander of Colophon]]):&lt;ref name ="Forbes"&gt;{{cite book|last=Forbes|first=Robert Jacobus|title=Studies in Ancient Technology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LbA3AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA179|volume=IX|year=1964|publisher=E. J. Brill|location=Leiden, Netherlands|page=179|oclc=180355272}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Nicander is our authority that it [magnetite ore] was called Magnes from the man who first discovered it on Mount Ida{{Cref2|note 1}} and he is said to have found it when the nails of his shoes and the ferrule of his staff adhered to it, as he was pasturing his herds.&lt;ref name ="Forbes" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The passage appears at Book XXXVI of ''Naturalis Historia'', covering "The Natural History of Stones", at chapter 25 entitled "The Magnet: Three Remedies".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Pliny the Elder|translator=John Bostock|translator2=H. T. Riley|title=The Natural History of Pliny|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9zwZAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA355|volume=VI|year=1857|publisher=H. G. Bohn|page=355|chapter=The Magnet: Three Remedies|location=London|oclc=615995}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Pliny's description is often cited, the story of Magnes the shepherd is postulated by physicist Gillian Turner to be much older, dating from approximately 900 BCE.&lt;ref name="Turner"&gt;{{cite book|last=Turner|first=Gillian|title=North Pole, South Pole: The Epic Quest to Solve the Great Mystery of Earth’s Magnetism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UfCC0lAtU_0C&amp;pg=PA6|year=2011|publisher=Awa Press|location=Wellington, NZ|isbn=978-1-61519-132-1|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Any writings Nicander may have made on the subject have since been [[Lost work|lost]].&lt;ref name="Colophon2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Nicander of Colophon|title=Poems and Poetical Fragments|editors=Translated by A.S.F.

Written in approximately 600 CE, book XVI of ''[[Etymologiae]]'' by [[Isidore of Seville]] tells the same story as Pliny, but places Magnes in India.&lt;ref name="Etymologiae"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Etymologies of Isidore of Seville|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3ep502syZv8C&amp;pg=PA319|date=2006|orig-year=source text c. 600 CE|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-139-45616-6|page=319}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This is repeated in [[Vincent of Beauvais]]' ''Miroir du Monde'' (c. 1250 CE)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Monthly literary register|title=The Monthly magazine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N2kEAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA571|year=1833|publisher=Charles Tilt|location=London|page=571}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in Thomas Nicols' 1652 work, ''Lapidary, or, the History of Pretious Stones'', wherein he describes Magnes as a "shepherd of India, who was wont to keep his flocks about those mountains in India, where there was an abundance of [[lodestone]]s".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Nicols|first=Thomas|title=Lapidary, or, the History of Pretious Stones: With Cautions for the Undeceiving of All Those that Deal with Pretious Stones|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=udBEAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA196|year=1652|publisher=Thomas Buck|location=Cambridge|page=196|oclc=12968778}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following from Pliny's account, the shepherd's name has been often cited as giving rise to the Latin [[Root (linguistics)|root word]] and etymological source of the English word for magnet and the coterie of its related word forms such as ''magnetite'', ''magnet'', ''magnetism'', ''[[magnesium]]'', ''[[manganese]]'' and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Weicker|first=Theodore|title=Merck Report: A Practical Journal of Pharmacy, Materia Medica, and Chemistry|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hkI1AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA289|volume=X|year=1901|publisher=Merck &amp; Company|location=New York|page=289|chapter=The Myth of Pliny|oclc=243874912}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other authorities, including the Roman poet and philosopher [[Lucretius]] ([[circa|c.]] 99&amp;nbsp;BCE – c. 55&amp;nbsp;BCE), have attributed the [[etymology]] of ''magnet'', and progeny, to the name of the [[Lydians|Lydian]] city, [[Magnesia ad Sipylum]] ([[Manisa|Manisa, Turkey]] in modern times), where magnetic ore may have first been discovered or recognized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Deer|first=William Alexander|title=Rock-forming Minerals: Non-silicates|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ASjwAAAAMAAJ|year=1962|publisher=Longmans|location=London|page=69|oclc=174165277}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Allom|first1=Thomas|last2=Walsh|first2=Robert |title=Constantinople and the scenery of the seven churches of Asia Minor|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dh5fAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA8-IA6|year=1839|publisher=Fisher, son, &amp; Co|location=London|page=10|oclc=332119}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other ancient locations have been attributed as the origin, including the Greek province Thracian Magnesia, and the [[Ionia]]n city of [[Magnesia on the Maeander|Magnesia ad Maeandrum]].&lt;ref name="Senning"&gt;{{cite book|last=Senning|first=Alexander|title=Elsevier's Dictionary of Chemoetymology: The Whys and Whences of Chemical Nomenclature and Terminology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Fl4sdCYrq3cC&amp;pg=PA240|date=2006|publisher=Elsevier|location=Amsterdam|isbn=978-0-08-048881-3|page=240}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea that the legend of Magnes the shepherd could be the origin of ''magnet'', et al., and the legend itself has been criticized. Pliny's story is characterized in Gillian Turner's book ''North Pole, South Pole: The Epic Quest to Solve the Great Mystery of Earth’s Magnetism'' (2011) as "no doubt embellished by centuries of retelling."&lt;ref name="Turner" /&gt; In the 1896 treatise ''Coil and Current; or the Triumphs of Electricity'', the authors write: &lt;blockquote&gt;'Magnet' is derived from the legend of Magnes, or from the territory of Magnesia. Pliny states that Magnes, the shepherd, discovered it, and the legend told of him is that while carrying a message over Mount Ida he felt his feet clinging to the earth, to the iron ore which lay thickly upon the hill. Hence the name of the Magnet. But Magnesia was a territory whence this native iron was for hundreds of years exported, and the name "Magnet" is, no doubt, due to this place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Frith|first1=Henry|author2=W. Stepney Rawson|title=Coil and Current; or the Triumphs of Electricity|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=V21YAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA4|year=1896|publisher=Ward, Lock and Co.|location=London|page=4|oclc=8158356}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As well as numerous World and European track medals, Hug is also a world class marathon athlete, winning the men's elite wheelchair event at the [[Berlin Marathon|Berlin]], ([[2011 Berlin Marathon|2011]], [[2012 Berlin Marathon|2012]]), [[New York City Marathon|New York City]] ([[2013 New York City Marathon|2013]], [[2016 New York City Marathon|2016]], [[2017 New York City Marathon|2017]]), [[London Marathon|London]] ([[2014 London Marathon|2014]], [[2016 London Marathon|2016]]), [[Chicago]] ([[2016 Chicago Marathon|2016]]), and [[Boston Marathon]]s ([[2015 Boston Marathon|2015]], [[2016 Boston Marathon|2016]], [[2017 Boston Marathon|2017]], [[2018 Boston Marathon|2018]]).

==Career history==

===Early career===
Hug was born in the municipality of [[Pfyn]] in Switzerland in 1986.&lt;ref name="Scheuringer"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/The+Swiss+silver+bullet.-a0302595333 |title=The Swiss silver bullet |accessdate=13 April 2014 |date=1 September 2012 |publisher=thefreelibrary.com |work=Swiss News |first=Carina |last=Scheuringer}}&lt;/ref&gt; Born with [[spina bifida]], Hug grew up on a farm, the youngest of four brothers.&lt;ref name="marcelhug"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.marcelhug.com/d/biografie/ |title=Biography |publisher=marcelhug.com |accessdate=13 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a young child, he met Swiss wheelchair racer, and Hug's sporting idol, [[Franz Nietlispach]], beginning Hug's desire to take up athletics.&lt;ref name="Scheuringer" /&gt; The ten-year-old Hug was introduced to racing when a sports teacher brought in an old racing wheelchair.&lt;ref name="Scheuringer" /&gt; This led to Hug competing in his first wheelchair race that year, the 3&amp;nbsp;km youth race which was part of the Schenkon Marathon.&lt;ref name="Scheuringer" /&gt; Winning this event inspired him to take up wheelchair athletics and he joined the Swiss Paraplegic Centre in [[Nottwil]] where he teamed up with trainer Paul Odermatt.&lt;ref name="Scheuringer" /&gt;&lt;ref name="marcelhug" /&gt;

The following years saw Hug develop from a junior athlete into an elite racer and he began competing in both Switzerland and abroad.&lt;ref name="marcelhug" /&gt; In 2001 he made the athletics team for Wheelchair Sport Switzerland (''Rollstuhlsport Schweiz''), and the same year he was accepted into the sports school at Kreuzlingen. Hug described the fact that he was the only wheelchair athlete at the school as being "immensely important for my personal development."&lt;ref name="Scheuringer" /&gt; In 2002 Hug accepted a place at the Schule fur Beruf und Weiterbildung (School for Employment and Further Education) in [[Romanshorn]], believing that an education outside sport would be vital in his later life.&lt;ref name="Scheuringer" /&gt;

===Elite career===
Hug competed in his first world class international when he was selected to represent Switzerland at the [[2004 Summer Paralympics]] in Athens despite not being part of the national team setup. He took part in both men's wheelchair relay races the [[Athletics at the 2004 Summer Paralympics – Men's 4 × 100 metre relay T53–T54|4 × 100m T53–T54]] and [[Athletics at the 2004 Summer Paralympics – Men's 4 × 400 metre relay T53–T54|4 × 400m T53–T54]], although Switzerland failed to progress through to the finals in either events. As an individual he competed in four races, reaching the finals in each.&lt;ref name="IPC bio"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.paralympic.org/athlete/marcel-hug |title=IPC Athletics: Marcel Hug |publisher=paralympic.org |accessdate=13 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He failed to medal in the 400m and 5000m but finishing third in both the 800m (1:32.66) and 1500m (3:05.48) where he won his two bronze medals.&lt;ref name="IPC bio" /&gt; On returning from the Games he was named Newcomer of the Year 2004 by Credit Suisse Sports Award and the following year he graduated to the Swiss national team.&lt;ref name="Scheuringer" /&gt;&lt;ref name="marcelhug" /&gt;

In 2006 Hug competed for Switzerland at the [[2006 IPC Athletics World Championships|IPC Athletics World Championships]] in Assen in the Netherlands. There he took his first major international gold medal when he won the men's 10,000m in the T54 (23:06.71). He collected a further three medals at the games, silvers in the 400m (48.97), 800m (1:39.10) and 5,000m (11:20.68).&lt;ref name="Infostrada bio"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ipc.infostradasports.com/asp/lib/theasp.asp?pageid=8937&amp;sportid=513&amp;personid=688389&amp;refreshauto=1 |title=Hug, Marcel |accessdate=13 April 2014 |publisher=ipc.infostradasports.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 400m he lost the gold to British racer [[David Weir (athlete)|David Weir]], beginning a rivalry between the two athletes that would define many of their races on the track and in marathons over the following years.&lt;ref name="Scheuringer" /&gt;&lt;ref name="IPC bio" /&gt;

In 2008 Hug travelled to Beijing with the Swiss team to compete in the [[2008 Summer Paralympics|Summer Paralympics]]. There he competed in four tracks events: the [[Athletics at the 2008 Summer Paralympics – Men's 400 metres T54|400m]], [[Athletics at the 2008 Summer Paralympics – Men's 800 metres T54|800m]], [[Athletics at the 2008 Summer Paralympics – Men's 1500 metres T54|1,500m]] and [[Athletics at the 2008 Summer Paralympics – Men's 5000 metres T54|5,000m]]; and the [[Athletics at the 2008 Summer Paralympics – Men's marathon T54|marathon]]. By his own admission the games were a disappointment, as he failed to record a single podium finish, crashing out in both the 1,500m and the marathon.&lt;ref name="Scheuringer" /&gt;&lt;ref name="IPC bio" /&gt; His fortunes changed over the next two years and this was highlighted by his results in the 2010 season. Between the 24 and 27 June 2010 Hug competed at a race meet in Switzerland. There he set new world records in four events in the T54 category: the 800m (1:31.12), 1,500m (2:54.51), 5,000m (9:53.05) and 10,000m (19:50.04).&lt;ref name="IPC bio" /&gt;

The next major competition for Hug was the [[2011 IPC Athletics World Championship]] held in Christchurch, New Zealand. Despite going into the Championship as the new world champion, David Weir, whose records Hug had broken in 2010, was also hitting form as he eyed the Paralympic finals in his home capital of London in 2012. Hug ambitiously entered all eight events available to him. He was disqualified from his less favoured sprint events, the [[2011 IPC Athletics World Championships – Men's 100 metres|100m]] and [[2011 IPC Athletics World Championships – Men's 200 metres|200m]], but in the mid distance [[2011 IPC Athletics World Championships – Men's 400 metres|400m]], he took the silver, finishing second to China's [[Liu Chengming]]. In the 800m, 1,500m and 5,000m Hug faced Weir in the finals, and was unable to beat his British rival, taking silver behind Weir in all three events. Hug was still able to leave the Championship with a gold when he took the 10,000m, but failed to complete the marathon.&lt;ref name="Scheuringer" /&gt;&lt;ref name="IPC bio" /&gt; It was during these championships that Hug gained the nickname 'The Silver Bullet', given to him in reference to his trademark silver helmet that he wears when racing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.lyon-2013.com/call-him-king-hug/ |title=Call him King Hug ! |first=Renaud |last=Goude |accessdate=13 April 2014 |date=28 July 2013 |publisher=lyon-2013.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140225020504/http://en.lyon-2013.com/call-him-king-hug/ |archivedate=25 February 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.paralympic.org/feature/weir-i-d-put-money-marcel-hug-win-gold |title=Weir: I’d put money on Marcel Hug to win gold |accessdate=13 April 2014 |date=5 July 2013 |publisher=paralympic.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

2011 also saw Hug win his first major city marathon event when he came first in the [[2011 Berlin Marathon]].&lt;ref name="nyrr"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nyrr.org/newsroom/press-release/world-champions-marcel-hug-and-manuela-sch%C3%A4r-join-new-york-city-marathon-wheelchair-field |title=World Champions Marcel Hug and Manuela Schär Join New York City Marathon Wheelchair Field |date=22 October 2013 |accessdate=13 April 2014 |publisher=nyrr.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:London Marathon 2013 Men's Wheelchair.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Hug, in his trademark silver helmet challenges David Weir at the [[2013 London Marathon]]]]
The 2011 World Championships set the scene for the build-up to the [[2012 Summer Paralympics]], held in London. Hug entered five events, reaching the finals in all of them. In the [[Athletics at the 2012 Summer Paralympics – Men's 400 metres T54|400m]] he qualified in second place in his heat, but finished fifth in the final. In the [[Athletics at the 2012 Summer Paralympics – Men's 800 metres T54|800m]] he came through his heat in second place to David Weir, and the result was repeated in the final, Hug taking silver to Weir's gold. In both the [[Athletics at the 2012 Summer Paralympics – Men's 1500 metres|1,500m]] and [[Athletics at the 2012 Summer Paralympics – Men's 5000 metres|5,000m]] he finished just outside the medals in fourth place.&lt;ref name="Infostrada bio" /&gt; In the [[Athletics at the 2012 Summer Paralympics – Men's marathon|marathon]], the final race of the Athletics program of the Paralympics, only a second separated Weir in gold, Hug in silver and Australia's [[Kurt Fearnley]] in bronze. Hug completed 2012 by retaining his marathon crown in German by winning the [[2012 Berlin Marathon]].&lt;ref name="nyrr" /&gt;

Weir's decision not to compete at the [[2013 IPC Athletics World Championships]] in Lyon, opened up the field. Hug took full opportunity of the situation and dominated the T54 track events. He entered six events winning gold in five of them: [[2013 IPC Athletics World Championships – Men's 400 metres|400 metres]], [[2013 IPC Athletics World Championships – Men's 1,500 metres|1,500 metres]], [[2013 IPC Athletics World Championships – Men's 5,000 metres|5,000 metres]], [[2013 IPC Athletics World Championships – Men's 10,000 metres|10,000 metres]] and [[2013 IPC Athletics World Championships – Men's marathon|Marathon]]. The only person to best him at the Championship was [[Kim Gyu-Dae]] of South Korea who pushed Hug into silver medal position in the [[2013 IPC Athletics World Championships – Men's 800 metres|800 metres]]. In November 2013 Hug entered his fourth [[New York Marathon]], and in a close race edged out South Africa's [[Ernst Van Dyk]] to take the title.&lt;ref name="nyrr" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newsday.com/sports/swiss-marcel-hug-ekes-out-nyc-marathon-wheelchair-win-by-less-than-a-second-1.6371909 |title=Marathon wheelchair win by less than a second |first=John |last=Jeansonne |date=3 November 2013 |accessdate=13 April 2014 |publisher=newsday.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 13 April 2014, a week after winning the [[Paris Marathon]], Hug entered the [[2014 London Marathon|London Marathon]], beating his long-time rival Weir into second place to take the men's wheelchair title.&lt;ref name="BBC-London" /&gt; This was Hug's first London Marathon win after finishing second in 2010, 2012 and 2013.&lt;ref name="BBC-London"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/wales/26979804 |publisher=BBC Sport |title=London Marathon 2014: David Weir loses out to Marcel Hug |date=13 April 2014 |accessdate=13 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After finishing fourth in the last two attempts, on 20 April 2015 Hug finished first in the [[2015 Boston Marathon|Boston Marathon]], beating ten-times winner [[Ernst Van Dyk]] into second place by over six minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/sports/2015/04/20/marcel-hug-wins-boston-marathon-men-wheelchair-race/OomSBwMCsOGUOUx9OX3hwJ/story.html |title=Marcel Hug wins men’s wheelchair race |accessdate=11 June 2015 |date=20 April 2014 |author=Gulizia, Anthony |work=The Boston Globe}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that year Hug competed in the [[2015 IPC Athletics World Championships]] in Doha, with  commentators believing the major medals would be contested between Hug and Weir.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/disability-sport/34500080 |publisher=BBC Sport |title=IPC World Athletics: What are the major rivalries in Doha? |date=20 October 2015 |accessdate=17 December 2015 |author=Hudson, Elizabeth}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.paralympic.org/news/doha-2015-prediction-panel-which-event-will-be-most-competitive |publisher=paralympic.org |title=Doha 2015 Prediction Panel: which event will be most competitive? |date=17 October 2015 |accessdate=17 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead the longer events were dominated by Thailand's [[Rawat Tana]], who took gold in both the 1500m and 5000m. Hug finished fifth in the 1500m but managed to win a silver in the 5000m.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.paralympic.org/static/info/doha-2015/eng/at/ATR173A_QA2015ATM595101ENG.htm |title=Results – Men's Shot Put F54 Final |accessdate=17 December 2015 |date=22 October 2015 |work=[[International Paralympic Committee|IPC]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.paralympic.org/static/info/doha-2015/eng/at/ATR173A_QA2015ATM525101ENG.htm |title=Results – Men's 5000m T54 Final |accessdate=17 December 2015 |date=26 October 2015 |work=[[International Paralympic Committee|IPC]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hug also entered the 800m, where he finished third to collect his second medal of the games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.paralympic.org/static/info/doha-2015/eng/at/ATR173A_QA2015ATM854101ENG.htm |title=Results – Men's 800m T54 Final |accessdate=17 December 2015 |date=29 October 2015 |work=[[International Paralympic Committee|IPC]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016 Hug won two elite city marathon events in the space of a week.

[[File:Marcel Hug Boston Marathon.jpg|thumb|Marcel Hug near halfway point of the Boston Marathon in 2018.]]
In 2016 Hug qualified for his fourth consecutive Paralympics, travelling to Rio de Janeiro where he took part in four events at the [[2016 Summer Paralympics]]. He won medals in all four events, two silvers in the 1500m and 5000m races and his first Paralympic gold medals, one in the 800m and then on the last day he also won the men's T54 marathon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aol.co.uk/sport/2016/09/15/rio-recap-gold-at-last-for-hug-brazil-into-football-final/|title=Rio Recap: Gold at last for Hug, Brazil into football final|work=aol.co.uk|date=16 September 2016|accessdate=9 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/live/disability-sport/37163734|title=Rio Paralympics: Weir out of marathon - as it happened|work=BBC Sport|date=18 September 2016|accessdate=9 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Rio, Hug continued to compete on the World Marathon circuit, and in October he won his first [[Chicago Marathon]], beating [[Kurt Fearnley]] in a photo finish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcchicago.com/news/local/mens-wheelchair-race-winner-2016-chicago-marathon-396448211.html|title=Marcel Hug Ruled Winner of 2016 Chicago Marathon Men's Wheelchair Race After Stunning Photo Finish|work=nbcchicago.com|date=9 October 2016|accessdate=9 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November, in a repeat of a photo finish against Kurt Fearnley, he won his second New York City Marathon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Tatyana-McFadden-wins-Fourth-straight-wheelchair-New-York-City-Marathon-400169561.html|title=Tatyana McFadden Wins Fourth Straight Wheelchair New York City Marathon|work=nbcnewyork.com|date=6 November 2016|accessdate=6 November 2016|first=Larry|last=Fleisher}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Margaret Rock''' (7 July 1903 –  26 August 1983) was one of the few women mathematicians who worked in Bletchley Park during [[World War II]]. With her math skills and education, Rock was able to decode the Enigma Machine against the German Army. Her work during the war was classified by the [[Official Secrets Act 1939]], so much of her work was not revealed during her lifetime.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2033674/Bletchley-Park-codebreaker-given-papers-telling-husband-did-working-her.html|title=Codebreaker, 90, handed Bletchley Park papers telling her what her husband did while working with her on Enigma machine|newspaper=Mail Online|access-date=11 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life ==
Rock was born and raised in Hammersmith, London to parents of Frank Ernest Rock and Alice Margaret Simmonds.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Dear Codebreaker: The Letters of Margaret Rock|last=Howard|first=Kerry|publisher=BookTower Publishing|year=2016|isbn=|location=Redditch, Worcestershire|pages=280, 355|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rock attended Edmonton elementary and North Middlesex School. Rock's father served in the [[Royal Navy]] as a surgeon  between 1894 and 1896 while her mother took care of her and her brother.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Frank Rock would send letters to his children frequently, to stay in communication in 1914, just before World War I.

In 1917, Margaret, her mother and brother settled in Portsmouth, London, after moving frequently for three years.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Rock attended [[Portsmouth High School (Southsea)|Portsmouth High School]], an all female private boarding school. Her father died when HMS Laurentic sank off the coast of Ireland having struck two mines laid by a German [[U-boat]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://laurenticmemorial.com/2017/12/29/frank-ernest-rock/|title=Frank Ernest Rock|author=|date=29 December 2017|website=laurenticmemorial.com|accessdate=9 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rock was encouraged by the letters her late father wrote to her, telling her to keep up with her studies and to be successful in the future. Her brother, John Frank Rock, became a Lieutenant in the Royal Engineers.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Education ==
Rock passed the London General School Exam in June 1919.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; During high school, she received honours in the classes of French, mathematics, and music.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Rock went to Bedford College, University of London, to earn a Bachelors of Arts Degree in 1921.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

After college, Rock was employed as a statistician by the National Association of Manufacturers (The Federation of British Industry).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Rock predicted the economic market and how different businesses and companies would respond to the market. In her free time, Margaret and her brother would travel to different countries such as Italy, France, Switzerland, and Sri Lanka.

== World War II==
In the beginning of World War II, Rock and her mother evacuated London to Cranleigh, Surrey.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Margaret quit her old job, wanting a career in a time when the woman's role was primarily to be the wife and stay-at-home mother. She was then recruited for a new job at [[Bletchley Park]] on 15 April 1940.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; She worked for Admiral [[Hugh Sinclair|Sir Hugh Sinclair]], who was the Head of Government Code and Cypher School and Secret Intelligence Service. She trained and worked alongside mathematicians and professors to break and decode enemy messages with the Enigma machine. Margaret went to work for [[Dilly Knox|Alfred Dilwyn Knox]], where Margaret worked closely with [[Mavis Lever]] on the same projects. While working for Dilwyn Knox she became the most senior cryptographer. Knox employed women, because he believed they had great skill with cryptography work.&lt;ref name="Margaret Rock"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://spartacus-educational.com/Margaret_Rock.htm|title=Margaret Rock|newspaper=Spartacus Educational|language=en|access-date=3 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Margaret Rock on August 1940, was considered by Dilwyn Knox to be the 4th or 5th best in the whole Enigma staff.&lt;ref name="Margaret Rock"/&gt; She specialized in German and Russian code breaking.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/women-were-key-code-breaking-bletchley-park-180954044/|title=Women Were Key to WWII Code-Breaking at Bletchley Park|last=|first=|date=|work=|newspaper=|language=|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Code breaking was used to verify which individuals in the war were double agents that would skew information and present them as truth.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

'''Wilfred Nalani "Moe" Keale''' (December 3, 1939 - April 15, 2002) was a musician of [[Music of Hawaii|Hawaiian music]], a [[ukulele]] virtuoso, and an [[United States|American]] [[actor]].  He was the uncle and major musical influence of [[Israel Kamakawiwoʻole]].

==Early life==
He was one of the few persons born in the 20th century to have pure [[Native Hawaiians|Hawaiian]] ancestry. His father was a [[kahuna]].&lt;ref name="Retrospective: A Mo`olelo, a  Story of Moe's Life"&gt;{{Cite web | title=Retrospective: A Mo`olelo, a  Story of Moe's Life |author= |first= |last2= |first2=  | publisher= | url=http://www.asminor.info/moekeale2020/retrospective.htm|  accessdate=20 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Moe Keale was born on the island of [[Niihau]], but raised on [[Oahu]].  He was shaped by the ancestral customs and values of his birthplace, learning to play the ukulele at the age of four.&lt;ref name="Great Ukulele Players"&gt;{{Cite web | title=Great Ukulele Players |author= |first= |last2= |first2=  | publisher=Brudda Bu's Ukulele Heaven | url=http://www.geocities.com/~ukulele/ukeplayers.html|  accessdate=20 May 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091028045121/http://www.geocities.com/~ukulele/ukeplayers.html|archivedate=2009-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Conversations in his Niihau family home were in [[Hawaiian language|Hawaiian]], and songs were passed from generation to generation.&lt;ref name="Niihau: The Traditions of an Hawaiian Island"&gt;{{cite book | last =Keale Sr| first =Moses |last2=Tava | first2=Rerioterai  | title =Niihau: The Traditions of an Hawaiian Island| publisher=Mutual Publishing | year =1990 | isbn =978-0-935180-80-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He would later fondly recall his summers on Niihau, where stress was not part of the lifestyle. "I figured that heaven must be something like Niihau," he said.&lt;ref name="Masters of Hawaiian Music:    Moe Keale"&gt;{{Cite web | title=Masters of Hawaiian Music:    Moe Keale  |author=Lindquist |first=Carl | publisher=CD liner notes | url=http://www.wedey.usanethosting.com/moe.htm|  accessdate=18 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
A native of [[Hawaii]], he primarily had roles in movies and TV series that took place in the islands, including many appearances on ''[[Hawaii Five-O (1968 TV series)|Hawaii Five-O]]'', where he had a recurring part as Truck Kealoha in the show's final season. He also appeared as Officer O'Shaughnessy in the Hawaiian-based [[National Broadcasting Company|NBC]] [[sitcom]], ''[[The Brian Keith Show]]''.

He was a beachboy, musician and singer, part-time electrician, and radio deejay, as well as an actor.&lt;ref name="Entertainers Mourn Moe Keale"&gt;{{Cite web | title=Entertainers Mourn Moe Keale  |author=Harada |first=Wayne |last2=Gordon |first2=Mike  | publisher=Honolulu Advertiser | url=http://www.mjq.net/fiveo/keale.htm|  accessdate=18 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; His first paid musical gig with his group the Four K's was at the Waikiki Tavern circa 1958, followed by the Tropical Club in [[Kailua, Hawaii County, Hawaii|Kailua-Kona]].  In 1964, he worked with the Puka Puka Otea Tahitian Show at Queen's Surf.&lt;ref name="His Songs Made Him a Son of Hawaii Forever"&gt;{{cite news |title=His Songs Made Him a Son of Hawaii Forever |last=Bernardo |first=Rosemary |newspaper=Honolulu Star Bulletin|date=24 April 2002 |url=http://archives.starbulletin.com/2002/04/24/news/story18.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was recruited for a New York city gig when he was seen at a beach doing high dives off a simulated waterfall.&lt;ref name="Masters of Hawaiian Music:    Moe Keale"/&gt;   His most noted role as Truck on ''Hawaii Five-O'' came as a result of his working as an electrician on the set.

Keale and [[Eddie Kamae]] struck up a musical partnership that led to Moe becoming part of the [[Sons of Hawaii]] in 1969,&lt;ref name="Hawaiian Music -  A Brief History"&gt;{{Cite web | title=Hawaiian Music -  A Brief History  |author= |first= |last2= |first2=  | publisher=Surfing for Life | url=http://www.surfingforlife.com/music.html|  accessdate=20 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he remained with the group until 1977.  He then went on to make three solo albums ''South Sea Island Magic'', ''Aloha Is A Part of Me, A Part of You'',  and ''Imagine''. He was a deejay on [[KCCN]] in the 1980s.&lt;ref name="Entertainers Mourn Moe Keale"/&gt;

From 1984 onward, he and his band played two evenings a week poolside at the [[Sheraton Waikiki]]. It was while performing at the Sheraton that he was struck by the fatal heart attack that ended his life on April 15, 2002.&lt;ref name="Retrospective: A Mo`olelo, a  Story of Moe's Life"/&gt;

At the time of his death, he was a hands-on co-owner of the Lomi Shop’s Keiki Wa‘a at the Hyatt Regency Waikiki Resort and Spa at Windward Mall.&lt;ref name="Lomilomi Shop Plays to Canoe Theme"&gt;{{cite news |title=Lomilomi Shop Plays to Canoe Theme|last=Nichols |first=Katherine |newspaper=Honolulu Advertiser|date=5 January 2001 |url=http://the.honoluluadvertiser.com/2001/Jan/05/15islandlife14.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Lomi Shop promoted the art of healing through [[lomilomi massage]].

Moe had a near-fatal heart attack in April 2001 and received a pacemaker implant.  He used his extension on life to raise $260,000 for the [[American Heart Association]], in order to have portable defibrillators strategically positioned throughout the state of Hawaii.&lt;ref name="Retrospective: A Mo`olelo, a  Story of Moe's Life"/&gt;

==Recognition==
In 2003, the [[Hawai'i Academy of Recording Arts]] instituted the Moe Keale "Aloha Is" Award in its [[Na Hoku Hanohano Awards]].&lt;ref name="Na Hoku Hanohano Award"&gt;{{Cite web  | title=Na Hoku Hanohano Award  | publisher=Hawai‘i Academy of Recording Arts  | url=http://www.nahokuhanohano.org/cms/index.php?page=Lifetime-awards  | accessdate=20 May 2010  | deadurl=yes  | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140227155255/http://www.nahokuhanohano.org/cms/index.php?page=Lifetime-awards  | archivedate=27 February 2014  | df=  }}  Hawai‘i Academy of Recording Arts&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Narragansett people''' are an [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian]] American Indian tribe from [[Rhode Island]]. The tribe was nearly landless for most of the 20th century, but it worked to gain [[federally recognized tribe|federal recognition]] and attained it in 1983. It is officially the '''Narragansett Indian Tribe of Rhode Island''' and is made up of descendants of tribal members who were identified in an 1880 treaty with the state. 

The tribe acquired land in 1991 in their lawsuit ''[[Carcieri v. Salazar]]'', and they petitioned the Department of the Interior to take the land into trust on their behalf. This would have made the newly acquired land to be officially recognized as part of the Narragansett Indian reservation, taking it out from under Rhode Island's legal authority. In 2009, the United States Supreme Court ruled against the request, declaring that tribes which had achieved federal recognition since the 1934 [[Indian Reorganization Act]] did not have standing to have newly acquired lands taken into federal trust and removed from state control.

==Reservation==
The Narragansett tribe was recognized by the federal government in 1983 and controls the '''Narragansett Indian Reservation,''' {{convert|1800|acre|km2}} of trust lands in [[Charlestown, Rhode Island]].&lt;ref name=p443&gt;Pritzker, 443&lt;/ref&gt; A small portion of the tribe resides on or near the reservation, according to the [[United States Census, 2000|2000 U.S. Census]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/DTTable?_bm=y&amp;-context=dt&amp;-ds_name=DEC_2000_SF1_U&amp;-CONTEXT=dt&amp;-mt_name=DEC_2000_SF1_U_P001&amp;-mt_name=DEC_2000_SF1_U_P003&amp;-tree_id=4001&amp;-transpose=N&amp;-redoLog=false&amp;-all_geo_types=Y&amp;-geo_id=25000US2415&amp;-search_results=25000US2415&amp;-_showChild=Y&amp;-format=&amp;-_lang=en&amp;-show_geoid=Y Narragansett Reservation, Rhode Island] United States Census Bureau {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080309143903/http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/DTTable?_bm=y&amp;-context=dt&amp;-ds_name=DEC_2000_SF1_U&amp;-CONTEXT=dt&amp;-mt_name=DEC_2000_SF1_U_P001&amp;-mt_name=DEC_2000_SF1_U_P003&amp;-tree_id=4001&amp;-transpose=N&amp;-redoLog=false&amp;-all_geo_types=Y&amp;-geo_id=25000US2415&amp;-search_results=25000US2415&amp;-_showChild=Y&amp;-format=&amp;-_lang=en&amp;-show_geoid=Y |date=March 9, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, they own several hundred acres in [[Westerly, Rhode Island|Westerly]].&lt;ref name=p443/&gt;

In 1991, the Narragansetts purchased {{convert|31|acre|m2}} in Charlestown for development of elderly housing. In 1998, they requested that the Department of the Interior take the property into trust on behalf of the tribe, to remove it from state and local control.  The case went to the [[United States Supreme Court]], as the state challenged the removal of new lands from state oversight by a tribe recognized by the US after the 1934 [[Indian Reorganization Act]]. Rhode Island was joined in its appeal by 21 other states.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boston.com/news/local/articles/2008/11/03/high_court_to_hear_case_over_indian_land/ Ray Henry, "High court to hear case over Indian land: Usage of tribal property at issue"],

In 2009, the US Supreme Court ruled that the Department of the Interior could not take land into trust, removing it from state control, if a tribe had achieved federal recognition after the 1934 [[Indian Reorganization Act]], and if the land in question was acquired after that federal recognition. Their determination was based on wording in the act which defines "Indian" as "all persons of Indian descent who are members of any recognized tribe now under federal jurisdiction."&lt;ref name="westerly"&gt;[http://www.thewesterlysun.com/news/local/high-court-thwarts-ri-casino-plan/article_01533d47-6053-5309-989b-7c3002815d09.html Chris Keegan, "High court thwarts RI casino plan"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130801081459/http://www.thewesterlysun.com/news/local/high-court-thwarts-ri-casino-plan/article_01533d47-6053-5309-989b-7c3002815d09.html |date=2013-08-01 }}, ''The Westerly Sun'', 25 February 2009, accessed 21 March 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

==Government==
The tribe is led by an elected tribal council, a chief ''[[sachem]],'' a medicine man, and a Christian leader. The entire tribal population must approve major decisions.&lt;ref name=p443/&gt; The administration in 2018 was:

* Chief Sachem: Anthony Dean Stanton
* Medicine Man: John Brown

==Name==
[[Roger Williams]] spent much time learning and studying the Narragansett language, and he wrote a definitive study on it in 1643 entitled ''[[A Key Into the Language of America]]''. He traced the source of the word ''Narragansett'' to a geographical location:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Being inquisitive of what root the title or denomination Nahigonset should come I heard that Nahigonsset was so named from a little island, between Puttaquomscut and Mishquomacuk on the sea and fresh water side. I went on purpose to see it, and about the place called Sugar Loaf Hill I saw it and was within a pole of it, but could not learn why it was called Nahigonset.&lt;ref&gt;[http://rihs.minisisinc.com/rihs/scripts/mwimain.dll/144/RIHS_M2A/LINK/SISN+1003?SESSIONSEARCH ''Roger Williams testimony about Narragansett Indians, 18 June, 1682''], manuscript in the collection of the Rhode Island Historical Society. Cited by E.R. Potter, ''The Early History of Narragansett'', Providence, 1835, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;This statement suggests that the original Narragansett homeland was a little island located near the northern edge of [[Point Judith Pond]], possibly the unnamed island in Billington cove. See S. Rider, ''The Lands of Rhode Island As they were Known to Caunounicus and Miantunnomu When Roger Williams Came in l636'', Providence, 1904, p. 202-205.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Berkeley anthropologist [[William Simmons (anthropologist)|William Simmons]] explains the name as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The name ''Narragansett'', like the names of most tribes in this region, referred to both a place and the people who lived there. Roger Williams, the first English settler of Providence, wrote that the name came from that of a small island, which he did not locate precisely but which may have been in what is now [[Point Judith Pond]]. He went to the island but could not learn why the Indians called it Narragansett.&lt;ref&gt;William S. Simmons, ''The Narragansett'', "Indians of North America" series, New York: Chelsea House, 1989, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Some Narragansetts believe that it means "people of the little points and bays". Pritzker's ''Native American Encyclopedia'' translates the name as people "of the Small Point".{{cn|date=October 2018}}&lt;!---The following is an incomplete citation and needs to be done correctly: (op. cit., p. 442).---&gt; Linguist [[James Hammond Trumbull]] explains that ''naiag'' or ''naiyag'' means a corner or angle in the [[Algonquian languages]], so that ''nai'' is found in the names of many points of land on the sea coast and rivers of New England, such as [[Nayatt Point Light|Nayatt Point]] in Barrington, RI, and [[Noyack, New York|Noyack]] on Long Island. The word ''na-ig-an-set'', according to Trumbull, signifies "the territory about the point", and ''na-ig-an-eog'' means "the people of the point".&lt;ref&gt;J. Hammond Trumbull, editorial note to Roger Williams's ''Key into the Language of America'', Publications of the Narragansett Club, first series, vol. 1, 1866, p. 82.&lt;/ref&gt; Colonial writers spelled it in a  variety of ways, such as Nanohigganset, Nahigonset, and Nahicans. The present spelling "Narragansett" was first used by Massachussetts governor [[John Winthrop]] in his ''History of New England'' (1646); the spelling "Nanohigganset" was used by assistant governor [[Edward Winslow]], while Rhode Island preacher [[Samuel Gorton]] preferred "Nanhyganset"; a host of other spellings were used by Roger Williams, including Nanhiggonsick, Nanhigonset, Nanihiggonsicks, Nanhiggonsicks, Narriganset, Narrogonset, and Nahigonsicks.&lt;ref&gt;See references given in S. Rider, ''The Lands of Rhode Island As they were Known to Caunounicus and Miantunnomu When Roger Williams Came in l636'', Providence, 1904, p. 200-201.&lt;/ref&gt;

Archaeologists discovered the remains of an Indian village on the northern edge of Point Judith Pond, near to the place which Roger Williams had indicated, now known as the Salt Pond Archaeological Site (site RI 110). Excavations revealed the remains of a coastal village from the [[Woodland period#Late_Woodland_period_(500–1000_CE)|Late Woodland period]], inhabited between about 1100 and 1300 A.D. Human burials were found, as well as evidence of houses and other structures, cooking and food storage places, and a range of artifacts. The site turned out to be quite important achaeologically because no other American Indian coastal village has ever been found in the Northeastern United States.{{cn|date=October 2018}}

==Language==
Traditionally, the tribe spoke the [[Narragansett language]], a member of the [[Algonquian languages]] family. The Narragansetts spoke a "Y-dialect", similar enough to the "N-dialects" of the [[Massachusett]] and [[Wampanoag]] to be mutually intelligible. Other Y-dialects include the [[Shinnecock Indian Nation|Shinnecock]] and [[Pequot]] languages spoken historically by tribes on Long Island and in Connecticut, respectively.

The Narragansett language became almost entirely extinct during the 20th century. The tribe has begun language revival efforts, based on early 20th century books and manuscripts, and new teaching programs. 

In the 17th century, [[Roger Williams (theologian)|Roger Williams]] learned the tribe's language. He documented it in his 1643 work ''[[A Key Into the Language of America]]''.  In that book Williams gave the tribe's name as ''Nanhigganeuck'' though later he used the spelling ''Nahigonset''.

[[American English]] has absorbed a number of loan words from Narragansett and other closely related languages, such as Wampanoag and Massachusett.  Such words include ''[[quahog]]'', ''[[moose]]'', ''[[papoose]]'', ''[[powwow]]'', ''[[Squash (fruit)|squash]]'', and ''[[succotash]]''.

==History==
[[Image:Tribal Territories Southern New England.png|thumb|300px|Narragansett tribal territory]]
{{refimprove section|date=December 2016}}
The Narragansetts were one of the leading tribes of New England, controlling the west of [[Narragansett Bay]] in [[Rhode Island]] and portions of [[Connecticut]] and eastern [[Massachusetts]], from the [[Providence River]] on the northeast to the [[Pawcatuck River]] on the southwest. The first European contact was in 1524 when explorer [[Giovanni de Verrazzano]] visited Narragansett Bay.

Between 1616 and 1619, infectious diseases killed thousands of Algonquians in coastal areas south of Rhode Island. The Narragansetts were the most powerful tribe in the southern area of the region when the English colonists arrived in 1620, and they had not been affected by the epidemics.&lt;ref name="hosm"&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Wright |editor1-first=Otis Olney |title=History of Swansea, Massachusetts, 1667-1917 |date=1917 |publisher=Town of Swansea |page=20|url=https://archive.org/stream/historyofswansea00wrig#page/20/mode/1up |accessdate=11 June 2018|oclc=1018149266}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chief [[Massasoit]] of the [[Wampanoag people|Wampanoags]] allied with the colonists at [[Plymouth Colony]] as a way to protect the Wampanoags from Narragansett attacks.&lt;ref name="hosm2"&gt;Wright, pg. 23&lt;/ref&gt; In the fall of 1621, the Narragansetts sent a sheaf of arrows wrapped in a snakeskin to Plymouth Colony as a threatening challenge, but Plymouth governor [[William Bradford (Plymouth governor)|William Bradford]] sent the snakeskin back filled with gunpowder and bullets. The Narragansetts understood the message and did not attack them.

European settlement in the Narragansett territory did not begin until 1635; in 1636, [[Roger Williams]] acquired land from Narragansett sachems Canonicus and Miantonomi and established [[Providence Plantations]].

===Pequot War===
During the [[Pequot War]] of 1637, the Narragansetts allied with the New England colonists. However, the brutality of the colonists in the [[Mystic massacre]] shocked the Narragansetts, who returned home in disgust.&lt;ref&gt;William Bradford, ''Of Plimoth Plantation, 1620-1647,'' ed. Samuel Eliot Morison (New York, NY: Alfred A. Knopf, 1966), p. 29; and John Underhill, ''Newes from America; or, A New and Experimentall Discoverie of New England: Containing, a True Relation of their War-like Proceedings these two yeares last past, with a figure of the Indian fort, or Palizado'' (London: I. D[awson] for Peter Cole, 1638), p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt;  After the Pequots were defeated, the colonists gave captives to their allies the Narragansetts and the [[Mohegan]]s. 

The Narrangansetts later had conflict with the Mohegans over control of the conquered Pequot land. In 1643, [[Miantonomi]] led the Narragansetts in an invasion of eastern Connecticut where they planned to subdue the Mohegans and their leader [[Uncas]].  Miantonomi had an estimated 1,000 men under his command.&lt;ref&gt;William Bradford, chapter 33, ''[[History of Plymouth Plantation]]''&lt;/ref&gt;  The Narragansett forces fell apart, and Miantonomi was captured and executed by Uncas' brother.  The following year, Narragansett war leader Pessicus renewed the war with the Mohegans, and the number of Narragansett allies grew.

The Mohegans were on the verge of defeat when the colonists came and saved them, sending troops to defend the Mohegan fort at Shantok. The colonists then threatened to invade Narragansett territory, so [[Canonicus]] and his son Mixanno signed a peace treaty.  The peace lasted for the next 30 years.

===King Philip's War===
Christian missionaries began to convert tribal members, and many Indians feared that they would lose their traditions by assimilating into colonial culture. The colonial push for religious conversion collided with Indian resistance.  In 1675, [[John Sassamon]], a converted "[[Praying Indian]]", was found bludgeoned to death in a pond. The facts about Sassamon's death were never settled, but historians accept that the Wampanoag sachem [[Metacomet]] - to whom the English settlers gave the baptismal name "Philip" - may have ordered the execution of Sassamon because of his cooperation with colonial authorities.  Three Wampanoag men were arrested, convicted, and hanged for Sassamon's death.

[[Image:Roger Williams and Narragansetts.jpg|thumb|Roger Williams and the Narragansetts, a 19th-century engraving after a painting by A. H. Wray]]

Metacomet subsequently declared war on the colonists in what the colonists called [[King Philip's War]]. Metacomet escaped an attempt to trap him in the Plymouth Colony, and the uprising spread across Massachusetts as other bands joined the fight, such as the Nipmuc. The Indians wanted to expel the colonists from New England. They waged successful attacks on settlements in Massachusetts and Connecticut, but Rhode Island was spared at the beginning, as the Narragansetts remained officially neutral.

However, the leaders of the United Colonies (Massachusetts, Plymouth, and Connecticut) accused the Narragansetts of harboring Wampanoag refugees. They made a preemptive attack on the Narragansett [[palisade]] fortress on December 19, 1675 in a battle that became known as the [[Great Swamp Fight]]. Hundreds of Narragansett non-combatants, including men, women, and children, died in the attack and burning of the fort, but nearly all of the warriors escaped. In January 1676, colonist Joshua Tefft was [[hanged, drawn, and quartered]] by colonial forces at [[Smith's Castle]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freewebs.com/kingsprovince/ "The Celebrated Josua Tefft"]&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Wickford, Rhode Island]], for having fought on the side of the Narragansetts during the Great Swamp Fight.

The Indians retaliated for the massacre in a widespread spring offensive beginning in February 1676 in which they destroyed all Colonial settlements on the western side of Narragansett Bay. The settlement of Providence Plantations was burned on March 27, 1676, destroying Roger Williams's house, among others. Other Indian groups destroyed many towns throughout New England, and even raided the suburbs of Boston. However, disease, starvation, battle losses, and the lack of gunpowder caused the Indian effort to collapse by the end of March.

Troops from Connecticut composed of the colonists and Mohegan allies swept into Rhode Island and killed substantial numbers of the now-weakened Narragansetts. A force of Mohegans and Connecticut militia captured Narragansett sachem Canonchet a few days after the destruction of Providence Plantations, while a force of Plymouth militia and Wampanoags hunted down Metacomet. He was shot and killed, ending the war in southern New England, although it dragged on for another year in Maine.

After the war, the English sold some surviving Narragansetts into slavery and shipped them to the [[Caribbean]]; others became [[indentured servant]]s in Rhode Island. The surviving Narragansetts merged with local tribes, particularly the Eastern Niantics. During colonial and later times, tribe members intermarried with colonists and Africans. Their spouses and children were taken into the tribe, enabling them to keep a tribal and cultural identity.

===18th century===
Ninigret, the chief sachem of the Narragansetts during King Philip's war, died soon after the war. He left four children by two wives. His eldest child, a daughter, succeeded him, and upon her death her half-brother Ninigret succeeded her. He left a will dated 1716-17, and died about 1722. His sons Charles Augustus and George succeeded him as sachems. George's son Thomas, commonly known as King Tom, succeeded in 1746. While King Tom was sachem, much of the Narragansett land was sold, and a considerable part of the tribe emigrated to the State of New York, joining other Indians there who belonged to the same Algonquin language group.&lt;ref&gt;E.R. Potter, ''The Early History of Narragansett'', Providence, 1835, p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, in the 1740s during the [[First Great Awakening]], colonists founded the Narragansett Indian Church to convert Indians to Christianity. In the ensuing years, the tribe retained control and ownership of the church and its surrounding {{convert|3|acre|m2}}, the only land that it could keep. This continuous ownership was critical evidence of tribal continuity when the tribe applied for federal recognition in 1983.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pluralism.org/research/profiles/display.php?profile=71802 Center Profile: Narragansett Indian Church&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===19th century===
In the 19th century, the tribe resisted repeated state efforts to declare that it was no longer an Indian tribe because its members were multiracial in ancestry. They contended that they absorbed other ethnicities into their tribe and continued to identify culturally as Narragansetts.

The tribal leaders resisted increasing legislative pressure after the [[American Civil War]] to "take up citizenship" in the United States, which would have required them to give up their treaty privileges and Indian nation status. The Narragansetts had a vision of themselves as "a nation rather than a race", and they insisted on their rights to Indian national status and its privileges by treaty.&lt;ref name="Gross"&gt;Ariela Gross, "Of Portuguese Origin": Litigating Identity and Citizenship among the "Little Races" in Nineteenth-Century America], ''Law and History Review'', Vol. 25, No.3, Fall 2007, accessed 22 Jun 2008. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080709055624/http://www.historycooperative.org/journals/lhr/25.3/gross.html |date=July 9, 2008 }} See also Ariela Gross, [https://books.google.com/books?id=olNMkg1_FeIC&amp;pg=PA128&amp;lpg=PA128&amp;dq=narragansett+%22We+are+not+negroes,+we+are+the+heirs+of+Ninagrit%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=WViPTeFp2W&amp;sig=ZSxTtP60TRfi9VHi2LPVFwfwKBM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjCp_yAq4PdAhXPVt8KHavZDZAQ6AEwAHoECAIQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''What Blood Won't Tell: a history of race on trial in America''], Harvard University Press, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; 

While testifying about this issue in a meeting with a committe of the state legislature in 1876, a Narragansett delegation said that their people saw injustices under existing US citizenship. They noted [[Jim Crow]] laws that limited the rights of blacks despite their citizenship under constitutional amendments. They also resisted suggestions that multiracial members of the tribe could not qualify as full members of the tribe. The Narragansetts had a tradition of bringing other people into their tribe by marriage and having them assimilate as culturally Narragansett, especially as their children grew up in the tribe. According to a record of their statement, they said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;We are not negroes, we are the heirs of Ninagrit, and of the great chiefs and warriors of the Narragansetts.  Because, when your ancestors stole the negro from Africa and brought him amongst us and made a [[Slavery in the United States|slave]] of him, we extended him the hand of friendship, and permitted his blood to be mingled with ours, are we to be called negroes? And to be told that we may be made negro citizens?  We claim that while one drop of Indian blood remains in our veins, we are entitled to the rights and privileges guaranteed by your ancestors to ours by solemn treaty, which without a breach of faith you cannot violate.&lt;ref&gt;The Narragansett reply is recorded in [https://books.google.com/books?id=ZgI0AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA166&amp;lpg=PA166&amp;dq=narragansett+%22We+are+not+negroes,+we+are+the+heirs+of+Ninagrit%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=vTS0Vs6pRc&amp;sig=pJ-huFr63GHxE8kAgjVTVsprOWo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjCp_yAq4PdAhXPVt8KHavZDZAQ6AEwAXoECAkQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=We%20are%20not%20negroes%2C%20we%20are%20the%20heirs%20of%20Ninagrit&amp;f=false "An Indian Opinion of Citizenship"], in F.

Carleton &amp; Co., 1876, p. 165-166, at date of Feb. 15, 1876.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

From 1880-84, the state persisted in its efforts at "detribalization". The tribe had agreed to negotiations for sale of its land, but it quickly regretted the decision and worked to regain the land. In 1880, the state recognized 324 Narragansett tribal members as claimants to the land during negotiations. The state put tribal lands up for public sale in the 19th century, but the tribe did not disperse and its members continued to practice its culture.

===20th century===
[[Image:NarragansettIndianChurch.jpg|thumb|The Narragansett Indian Church in Charlestown was founded in the 1740s. This building was constructed in 1859 to replace one that burned down.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.preservation.ri.gov/pdfs_zips_downloads/national_pdfs/charlestown/char_historic-village-of-the-narragansetts.pdf&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120511065048/http://www.preservation.ri.gov/pdfs_zips_downloads/national_pdfs/charlestown/char_historic-village-of-the-narragansetts.pdf |date=May 11, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The Naragansetts lost control of much of their tribal lands during the state's late 19th century detribalization, but they kept a group identity.  The tribe incorporated in 1900 and built their [[longhouse]] in 1940 as a traditional place for gatherings and ceremonies.

In the late 20th century, they took action to have more control over their future. They regained {{convert|1800|acre|km2}} of their land in 1978, and gained federal recognition as a tribe in 1983. According to tribal rolls, there are approximately 2,400 members of the Narragansett Tribe today.  Like most Americans, they have mixed ancestry, with descent from the Narragansetts and other tribes of the New England area, as well as Europeans and Africans.

===21st century===
A 2006 survey conducted in preparation for development of a new residential subdivision revealed what archaeologists consider the remains of a Narragansett Indian village dating from 1100 to 1300. It is located  at the top of [[Point Judith Pond]] in [[Narragansett, Rhode Island]]. This area had been identified in a 1980s survey as historically sensitive, and the state had a conflict with the developer when more remains were found. The state intervened in order to prevent development and to buy the 25-acre site for preservation; it was part of 67 acres planned for development by the new owner.&lt;ref name="nytimes"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/07/realestate/commercial/07indian.html ELIZABETH ABBOTT, "Ancient Indian Village in Rhode Island Pits Preservation Against Property Rights"], ''New York Times,'' 6 April 2010; accessed 5 December 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

Further [[archaeological]] excavation on the site quickly revealed that it was one of two villages on the Atlantic Coast to be found in such complete condition. The other pre-Columbian village (''Otan'' in Narragansett Algonquin) is in Virginia. It has a high concentration of permanent structures.&lt;ref name="nytimes"/&gt;{{cn|date=December 2016}}

&lt;blockquote&gt;Preliminary surveys of the Narragansett tract, known as RI 110, have revealed a village with perhaps as many 22 structures, as well as three known human burial sites. There is also evidence of granaries, ceremonial areas and storage pits that may shed new light on the importance of maize agriculture to woodland tribes.&lt;ref name="nytimes"/&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Historians and archeologists knew that [[maize]] was cultivated by [[Algonquian peoples|Algonquin]] tribes, but there has never been physical evidence before the discovery of this site. The tribe's method of grinding the kernels into a powder was not conducive to preservation. In the first week of excavation, 78 kernels of corn were found at this site, the first time that cultivation of maize could be confirmed this far north on the Atlantic Coast. 

The current members of the [[Narragansett (tribe)|Narragansett]] tribe have contributed through oral history to accounts about the ancient people who inhabited this site. They were members of the Turtle [[Clan]], and the settlement was a conduit for trade in medicines. They used the surrounding pond and its many islands for hunting camps, resource collection, fishing, shellfish, burial sites, and herbal collections for medicine and ceremony. 

Providence founder [[Roger Williams (theologian)|Roger Williams]] was brought to the top of Sugarloaf Hill in nearby Wakefield when treating with the Narragansett tribe. They pointed toward this large settlement and told him that it was called ''Nanihigonset.'' This site is now believed to be the center of the [[Narragansett (tribe)|Narragansett]] geography, where they coalesced as a tribe and began to extend their dominion over the neighboring tribes at different points in history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kirby |first=Shaun |title=Salt Pond, center of the ancient Narragansett world |url=http://www.ricentral.com/content/salt-pond-center-ancient-narragansett-world |archive-url=https://archive.is/20140418084803/http://www.ricentral.com/content/salt-pond-center-ancient-narragansett-world |dead-url=yes |archive-date=18 April 2014 |work=Rhode Island Central News and Information |publisher=Southern Rhode Island Newspapers |accessdate=18 April 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Land claim suit===

In January 1975, the Narragansett Tribe filed suit in federal court to regain {{convert|3200|acre|km2}} of land in southern Rhode Island which they claimed the state had illegally taken from them in 1880.  The 1880 Act authorizing the state to negotiate with the tribe listed 324 Narragansetts approved by the Supreme Court as claimants to the land.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rihs.org/mssinv/MSS369.htm "Paul Campbell Research Notes", Rhode Island Historical Society, April 1997], accessed 3 Aug 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1978, the Narragansett Tribe signed a Joint Memorandum of Understanding (JMOU) with the state of Rhode Island, Town of Charlestown, and private property owners in settlement of their land claim.  The state transferred a total of {{convert|1800|acre|km2}} to a corporation formed to hold the land in trust for descendants of the 1880 Narragansett Roll. In exchange, the tribe agreed that the laws of Rhode Island would be in effect on those lands, except for hunting and fishing. The Narragansetts had not yet been federally recognized as a tribe.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.liebertonline.com/doi/abs/10.1089/glr.1999.3.25 Jana M.

===Federal recognition===
The tribe prepared extensive documentation of its genealogy and proof of continuity as descendants of the 324 tribal members of treaty status. In 1979 the tribe applied for federal recognition, which it finally regained in 1983 as the '''Narragansett Indian Tribe of Rhode Island''' (the official name used by the [[Bureau of Indian Affairs]]).

The state and tribe have disagreed on certain rights on the reservation.  On July 14, 2003, Rhode Island state police raided a tribe-run smoke shop on the Charlestown reservation, the culmination of a dispute over the tribe's failure to pay state taxes on its sale of cigarettes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Clarkson: Bull Connor would have been proud |url = http://www.indiancountrytoday.com/archive/28181844.html | publisher = Indian Country Today | author = Gavin Clarkson | date = 2003-07-25 | accessdate = 2009-12-14 }}{{dead link|date=December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, the U.S. First Circuit Court of Appeals declared the police action a violation of the tribe's sovereignty.  In 2006, an ''[[en banc]]'' decision of the First Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the prior decision, stating that the raid did not violate the tribe's sovereign immunity because of the 1978 Joint Memorandum of Agreement settling the land issues, in which the tribe agreed that state law would be observed on its land.

In a separate federal civil rights lawsuit, the tribe charged the police with the use of excessive force during the 2003 raid on the smoke shop. One Narragansett man suffered a broken leg in the confrontation. The case was being retried in the summer of 2008. Competing police experts testified on each side of the case.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thewesterlysun.com/articles/2008/07/25/news/free_news/doc4888912096791488125125.txt "Police experts testify in smoke shop trial"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130801085242/http://www.thewesterlysun.com/articles/2008/07/25/news/free_news/doc4888912096791488125125.txt |date=2013-08-01 }}, ''The Westerly Sun,'' 25 Jul 2008, accessed 3 Aug 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

The Narragansett Tribe is negotiating with the General Assembly for approval to build a casino in Rhode Island with their partner, currently [[Harrah's Entertainment]]. The Rhode Island Constitution declares to be illegal all non-state-run [[Rhode Island Lottery|lotteries]] or gambling. A proposed constitutional amendment to allow the tribe to build the casino was voted down by state residents in November 2006.

The tribe has plans to upgrade the Longhouse that it constructed along [[Rhode Island Route 2|RI Route 2]] (South County Trail) to serve as a place of American Indian cuisine and cultural meeting house.  These plans have been in the works for more than 15 years. The Longhouse was built in 1940 and has fallen into disrepair. Upgrades are also being planned for the Narragansett tribal medical, technological, and artistic systems.

The Narragansetts have undertaken efforts to review tribal rolls and reassess applications for membership, like numerous other tribes in the 21st century.  They currently require tribal members to show direct descent from one or more of the 324 members listed on the 1880-84 Roll, which was established when Rhode Island negotiated land sales.

The current population numbers about 2,400 and the tribe has closed the rolls. They have dropped some people from the rolls and denied new applications for membership. Scholars and activists see this as a national trend among tribes, prompted by a variety of factors, including internal family rivalries and the issue of significant new revenues from Indian casinos.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2006-11-28-tribes-cover_x.htm  Emily Bazar, "Native American?

The [[US Supreme Court]] agreed to hear ''[[Carcieri v. Salazar]]'' (2009) in the fall of 2008, a case determining American Indian land rights.

The authority was part of the 1934 [[Indian Reorganization Act]], but the state argued that the process could not hold for tribes that achieved federal recognition after 1934. The US Supreme Court upheld the state based on language in the act.&lt;ref name=Scotus /&gt;  At issue is {{convert|31|acre|m2}} of land in Charlestown which the Narragansetts purchased in 1991. The Narragansetts requested the DOI to take it into trust on their behalf in order to remove it from state and local control, after trying to develop it for elderly housing under state regulations in 1998.&lt;ref name="boston.com"/&gt;

==Cultural institutions==
The tribe hosts their annual meeting [[Pow wow|powwow]] on the second weekend of August on their reservation in Charlestown, Rhode Island. It is a gathering of thanksgiving and honor to the Narragansett people and is the oldest recorded powwow in North America, dating back to 1675's colonial documentation of the gathering (the powwow had been held long before European contact).

In August 2017, the tribe held the 342nd powwow with events including the traditional [[Pow wow#Opening|grand entry]], a procession of military veterans, dancers, and honored tribal representatives, and the ceremonial lighting of a [[Firekeeper|sacred fire]]. There was also a church service, food vendors, and arts and crafts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Farragher |first=Thomas |url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2017/08/09/this-narragansett-leader-still-going-strong/Q0yZjzqhCq2m558B7mHpxH/story.html |title=Meet the Narragansett leader who is still going strong at 99 |work=[[The Boston Globe]] |date=2017-08-09 |accessdate=2017-08-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''Nazi hunter''' is a private individual who tracks down and gathers information on alleged former [[Nazi]]s, [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] members, and [[Nazi collaborators]] who were involved in [[the Holocaust]], typically for use at trial on charges of [[war crime]]s and [[crime against humanity|crimes against humanity]]. Prominent Nazi hunters include [[Simon Wiesenthal]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/581109.stm |title=Simon Wiesenthal: Nazi hunter |work=[[BBC News]] |date=28 December 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tuviah Friedman]], [[Serge Klarsfeld|Serge]] and [[Beate Klarsfeld]], [[Ian Sayer]], [[Yaron Svoray]], [[Elliot Welles]], and [[Efraim Zuroff]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.operationlastchance.org/HUNGARY_OLCactivities_PR.htm Wiesenthal Center Urges Australian Authorities to Expedite Extradition Proceedings Against Holocaust Perpetrator]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
With the onset of the [[Cold War]] following [[World War II]], both the Western Allies and the [[USSR]] sought out former Nazi scientists and operatives for programs such as [[Operation Paperclip]]. Cooperative former Nazis, such as [[Wernher von Braun]] and [[Reinhard Gehlen]], were occasionally given state protection in return for valuable information or services. At the time, Gehlen had been chief of the German ''[[Bundesnachrichtendienst]]'' (federal intelligence agency), founder of the [[Gehlen Org]],  "a true life version of [[ODESSA]]"&lt;ref name="Levy2004"&gt;{{cite book|author=Joel Levy|title=Secret History: Hidden Forces That Shaped the Past|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LpT0CQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA37|date=4 November 2004|publisher=Summersdale Publishers Limited|isbn=978-1-84839-640-1|pages=37–41}}&lt;/ref&gt; network, which helped exfiltrate Nazis from Europe. Other Nazis used [[Ratlines (World War II)|ratlines]] to escape post-war Europe to places such as South America.&lt;ref&gt;Parton, Nigel R. "Book Review: The Beast Reawakens." European History Quarterly 30, no. 2 (2000): 291–294.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://commonsensejournal.org.uk/files/2010/08/CommonSense16.pdf#page=7 Mendes, Alfred. "Bosnia, Bohemia &amp; Bilderberg: The Cold War Internationale." In Common Sense: Journal of the Edinburgh Conference, vol. 16, pp. 5–15. 1994.]&lt;/ref&gt;

In response, Nazi hunters sought out fugitives on their own or formed groups, such as the [[Simon Wiesenthal Center]]. Methods used by Nazi hunters include offering rewards for information,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/0,1518,528540,00.html |title=Nazi Hunters More Than Double Reward to $25,000 |work=Spiegel Online International |date=14 January 2008 |accessdate=26 May 2011 |author=David Crossland}}&lt;/ref&gt; reviewing immigration and military records,&lt;ref name="ptr"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pittsburghlive.com/x/pittsburghtrib/news/multimedia/s_502802.html |title=The Nazi hunt continues for ex-guards |work=Pittsburgh Tribune-Review |date=15 April 2007 |accessdate=8 May 2017 |author=Jason Cato |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080818113818/http://www.pittsburghlive.com/x/pittsburghtrib/news/multimedia/s_502802.html |archive-date=18 August 2008 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and launching civil lawsuits.&lt;ref name="ptr"/&gt;

In later decades, Nazi hunters found greater cooperation with Western and South American governments and the state of [[Israel]]. By the end of the 20th century, pursuit of former Nazis declined, because most of the generation active in Nazi leadership had died.&lt;ref name="ptr"/&gt;

==Notable targets==
The Simon Wiesenthal Center publishes an annual report on [[Nazi war criminals]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wiesenthal.com/atf/cf/%7B54d385e6-f1b9-4e9f-8e94-890c3e6dd277%7D/NAZI-WAR-CRIMINALS-REPORT_2013.PDF|title=Simon Wiesenthal Center 2013 Annual Report on the Status of Nazi War Criminal|first=Efraim|last=Zuroff|date=April 2013|website=Simon Wiesenthal Center}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some notable targets of Nazi hunters have included:

*[[Klaus Barbie]], the "Butcher of Lyon", was extradited from [[Bolivia]] to France in 1983, after earlier attempts by [[Serge Klarsfeld|Serge]] and [[Beate Klarsfeld]] to track him. Until Bolivia's transition to democracy, he had been protected by the US and German intelligence services for anti-Soviet intelligence purposes, and employed by the Bolivian army under an alias. Sentenced to life imprisonment in 1987, he died in 1991.
*[[Herberts Cukurs]], the "Butcher of Riga", was assassinated by [[Mossad]] agents in Montevideo, Uruguay, in 1965.
*[[Adolf Eichmann]] was pursued by Wiesenthal before being [[Adolf Eichmann#Capture in Argentina|captured and smuggled]] from [[Argentina]] in 1960 by the Israeli spy agency, [[Mossad]] and was tried in [[Israel]], after which he was executed.
*[[Boļeslavs Maikovskis]], a Latvian Nazi collaborator, was pursued to [[Mineola, New York]] by Welles.  Maikovskis eventually emigrated to West Germany in 1987, where he was found unfit to stand trial due to age.
*[[Josef Mengele]], the "Angel of Death", was sought in various South American countries by Mossad, Wiesenthal, and the Klarsfelds. He evaded capture until his accidental death in Brazil in 1979; his remains were identified in 1985.
*[[Erich Priebke]], an SS officer responsible for the mass murder of Italian civilians, was interviewed openly in Argentina in 1994, by [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] ''[[Primetime Live]]'' host [[Sam Donaldson]]. He was subsequently extradited to Italy and, in 1998, sentenced to house arrest for life.
*[[Eduard Roschmann]] was sought by Wiesenthal in Argentina. The Argentine government made plans for his extradition public in 1977, allowing him to escape to Paraguay. He apparently died the same year, but Wiesenthal was sceptical that the body was Roschmann's.
*[[Dinko Šakić]] was pursued to Argentina by Zuroff. Making no attempt to hide, he made several media appearances before being extradited to Croatia in 1998, where he was sentenced to 20 years and died in 2008.
*[[Josef Schwammberger]] was traced to Argentina by the Simon Wiesenthal Center and Welles. Extradited to West Germany in 1990, he was sentenced to life imprisonment in 1992 and died in 2004.
*[[Franz Stangl]], the commandant of the [[Sobibór]] and [[Treblinka]] extermination camps, was caught by Wiesenthal in São Paulo, in 1967. He was extradited to Germany in 1970 and sentenced to life in prison, where he died the following year.
*[[Gustav Wagner]], the "Wolf", was exposed by Wiesenthal in Brazil, in 1978. He was arrested, but Brazil refused to extradite him to West Germany. Wagner apparently committed suicide in São Paulo in 1980.

'''Neale Donald Walsch''' (born September 10, 1943) is an American author of the series ''[[Conversations with God]]''. He is also an actor, screenwriter, and speaker.

==Biography==
Walsch was brought up as a Roman Catholic by a family who encouraged his quest for spiritual truth. He informally studied comparative theology for many years. He says his books are not [[Channeling (mediumistic)|channelled]], but rather that they are inspired by God and that they can help a person relate to God from a modern perspective. Walsch's vision is an expansion and unification of all present theologies to render them more relevant to our present day and time. He created [[Humanity's Team]] as a spiritual movement whose purpose is to communicate and implement his New Spirituality beliefs, particularly that we are all one with God and one with life, in a shared global state of being.&lt;ref&gt;John Style, “What Happens When God Describes Utopia?: Neale Donald Walsch's Utopian
Vision”, Spaces of Utopia: An Electronic Journal, nr. 1, Spring 2006, pp. 135–147 &lt;http://ler.letras.up.pt &gt;
ISSN 1646-4729&lt;/ref&gt; This state can be achieved, Walsch argues, by the act of helping other people: "The fastest way to apply anything in your life is to help others to apply it... The fastest way to use any wisdom that resides in your soul is to help someone else... Because we are all one".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.poeticmind.co.uk/creative-thoughts/being-at-one-neale-donald-walsch-interview-with-gil-dekel-phd-part-3-of-3/ Being at One: Neale Donald Walsch Interview with Gil Dekel (Part 3 of 3, paragraphs 18–19)]&lt;/ref&gt; Walsch has nine children. He has a home in southern Oregon where he lives with his wife, Em Claire, who is a working poet.

==Career==
Before writing the ''Conversations With God'' series, Walsch worked variously as a radio station program director, newspaper managing editor, and in marketing and public relations. In the early 1990s he suffered a series of crushing blows—a fire that destroyed all of his belongings, the break-up of his marriage, and a car accident that left him with a broken neck. Once recovered, but alone and unemployed, he was forced to live in a tent in Jackson Hot Springs, just outside [[Ashland, Oregon]], collecting and recycling aluminium cans in order to eat. At the time, he thought his life had come to an end. Despondent, he began his writings after working his way out of homelessness and following a stint as a radio talk show host.&lt;ref&gt;Edgar John Burns, ''Foundations of a Global Spiritual Awakening'', AuthorHouse, 2003, {{ISBN|1-4107-5865-6}}, {{ISBN|978-1-4107-5865-1}}, pp. 120–123&lt;/ref&gt;

His first book, ''Conversations with God,'' was published in 1995 and became an international bestseller. It remained on the ''New York Times'' Bestseller List for 135 weeks. Six of his other books have made the ''Times'' list in the years since. He has published 28 books and his works have been translated into 37 languages.

===Media appearances===
In 2003, the film ''[[Indigo (film)|Indigo]]'', written by Walsch and [[James Twyman]] and directed by [[Stephen Simon]] was released. It chronicled the fictional story of the redemption of a grandfather, played by Walsch, through his granddaughter, who is an [[indigo children|indigo child]].

''Conversations With God: The Movie'' opened in U.S. theaters in 2006 on October 27 and in Canada on November 10.  The film was released on DVD in February 2007.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0489682/dvd&lt;/ref&gt; Clips of the film can be found on YouTube.&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|abIu5JeZes8|CWGFavoriteMoments}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==

Walsch was accused of plagiarism for a six-paragraph entry in one of the daily postings on his blog during 2008, this one during the Christmas season, when he published an item titled "Upside down, or right side up?" on [[Beliefnet.com]].&lt;ref name="motoko"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.beliefnet.com/conversationswithgod/2008/12/upside-down-or-right-side-up.html Conversations with God], Belief.net&lt;/ref&gt; Walsch's entry purported to tell the tale of a miraculous appearance of the words "Christ Was Love" during the rehearsal of his son's school Christmas pageant; but his article was almost identical to an article published 10 years previously by Candy Chand in the spiritual magazine ''[[Clarity (magazine)|Clarity]]'' and spread over the internet in places such as the Heartwarmers website, down to the name of the son mentioned in both articles, Nicholas – as both authors have a son named Nicholas.&lt;ref name="motoko"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20020919205341/http://archive.mail-list.com/heartwarmers/msg00724.html a heartwarmer: Christmas Love], email in Heartwarmers.com mailing list, posted by moderator, history signed by Candy Chand, 2000-12-10&lt;/ref&gt; Walsch publicly apologized, saying that he must have erroneously internalized the story as his own over the years, a claim the original author said she does not believe.&lt;ref name="motoko"/&gt; The article was subsequently pulled from Beliefnet.com and Walsch voluntarily withdrew from the roster of authors because of his error.&lt;ref name="motoko"/&gt; Walsch explained that he found the anecdote in old computer files from years earlier, saw his son's name in the copy, and was fully convinced that the history had really happened to him and that he had just forgotten it, but "remembered" when he saw the anecdote in his file. He cited it as a classic case of false memory and said that he had been repeating the anecdote as his own in many speeches over the years, adding that he was "chagrined and astonished that my mind could play such a trick on me".&lt;ref name="motoko"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/09/books/07book.html "Christmas Essay Was Not His, Author Admits"], ''[[New York Times]]'', Motoko Rich, 2009-01-06&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nicholas Rémy''', Latin '''Remigius''' (1530–1616) was a French magistrate who became famous as a hunter of witches comparable to [[Jean Bodin]] and [[De Lancre]].&lt;ref&gt;Jackson J. Spielvogel ''Western Civilization: Since 1300'' Page 446 "Nicholas Rémy, a witchcraft judge in France in the 1590s, found it "not unreasonable that this scum of humanity [witches] should be drawn chiefly from the feminine sex.""&lt;/ref&gt;

After studying law at the [[University of Toulouse]], Remy practised in [[Paris]] from 1563 to 1570. In 1570, his uncle retired as Lieutenant General of Vosges and Remy was appointed to the post; in 1575 he was appointed as secretary to Duke [[Charles III of Lorraine]].

Remy wrote a number of poems and several books on history, but is known for his ''[[Daemonolatreiae libri tres]]'' ("Demonolatry"), published in [[Lyon]] in 1595. The book was reprinted several times, translated into German, and eventually replaced the [[Malleus Maleficarum]] as the most recognized handbook of [[witch-hunt]]ers in parts of Europe.

According to Remy, the [[Devil]] could appear before people in the shape of a [[black cat]] or man, and liked [[Black Mass]]es. [[Demon]]s could also have [[sexual relationship]]s with women and, in case they did not agree, [[rape]] them.

Between 1591 and 1606, he condemned hundreds of people at the stake for [[Satanism]]. This cannot be corroborated against surviving records, but Remy cited over one hundred specific cases in ''Demonolatry''.

He was of the [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] faith, and did his work with the blessings of the Church, but was not himself a priest and married at least once (possibly twice), fathering quite a few children. One of them, a favored son, was supposedly killed in a street accident at the beginning of Remy's judicial career after being cursed by an old beggar woman when Remy refused to give her any money. This incident in 1582 was the start of Remy's career as a witch-hunter. He successfully prosecuted the beggar for bewitching his son and had the woman put to death.

Finding witches was very personal business for Remy. An extremely educated man for his day, he utterly believed in what he was doing. He saw every "witch" he burned as real, and considered it justice done. Remy personally sentenced 900 people to death between 1581-1591. In 1592, Remy retired and moved to the country to escape the [[bubonic plague|plague]]. There he compiled notes from his ten-year campaign against witchcraft into the ''Demonolatry''.

==Fictional portrayal==
*In the 1988 television series ''[[Werewolf (TV series)|Werewolf]]'', Nicholas Remy is shown as a [[werewolf]] who has been alive since the times of the Inquisition.  He used his position as a magistrate to conceal his own [[lycanthrope|lycanthropy]].  The character was portrayed by [[Brian Thompson]].
*Nicholas Remy and his book, ''[[Daemonolatreiae libri tres]]'', are also featured in the 1999 movie ''[[The Ninth Gate]]''.

[[File:Paul Brunton.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|A portrait of Paul Brunton]]
'''Paul Brunton''' is the pen name of '''Raphael Hurst''' (21 October 1898 – 27 July 1981), a British theosophist and spiritualist. He is best known as one of the early popularizers of [[Hinduism in the West#Neo-Hindu movements 1950s.E2.80.931980s|Neo-Hindu spiritualism]] in western [[esotericism]], notably via his bestselling ''A Search in Secret India'' (1934).

Brunton was a proponent of a doctrine of "Mentalism", or ''Oriental Mentalism'' to distinguish it from [[subjective idealism]] of the western tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Mansfield |first=Victor |title=Synchronicity, science, and soul-making |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jSf_jIN4Yt8C&amp;pg=PA195&amp;dq=Paul+Brunton+mentalism#v=onepage&amp;q=Paul%20Brunton%20mentalism&amp;f=false |page=195 |year=1995 |isbn=9780812693041 |quote=The world is the invention of Universal Mind.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Feuerstein |first=Georg |title=Lucid Waking |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jMepDq0yiioC&amp;pg=PA157&amp;dq=Paul+Brunton+mentalism&amp;lr=#v=onepage&amp;q=Paul%20Brunton%20mentalism&amp;f=false |pages=157–158 |year=1997 |publisher=Inner Traditions/Bear &amp; Co. |isbn=9780892816132 |quote=We like to reiterate that 'everything is relative'...}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brunton expounds his doctrine of Mentalism in ''The Hidden Teachings Beyond Yoga'' (1941) and in ''The Wisdom of the Overself'' (1943).

==Biography==
Hurst was born in [[London]] in 1898. 
He served in a tank division during the [[First World War]], and later devoted himself to mysticism and came into contact with [[Theosophist]]s.
He married Karen Augusta Tuttrup in 1921, with whom he had a son, Kenneth Thurston Hurst (b. 1923).
After his wife had an affair with his friend Leonard Gill, the marriage ended in divorce in 1926, but Hurst remained on friendly terms with his ex-wife and with Gill.
He was a bookseller and journalist, and wrote under various pseudonyms, including Raphael Meriden and Raphael Delmonte.
Being partner of an occult bookshop, The [[Atlantis Bookshop]], in [[Bloomsbury]], Hurst came into contact with both the literary and occult British [[intelligentsia]] of the 1920s.

In 1930, Hurst embarked on a voyage to India, which brought him into contact with [[Meher Baba]], [[Vishuddhananda Paramahansa]], [[Paramacharya]] of Kancheepuram and [[Ramana Maharshi]]. At the Paramacharya's insistence, he met Bhagavan Ramana Maharshi, which led to a turn of events culminating in revealing Ramana to the western world.
Hurst's first visit to Sri Ramana's [[Sri Ramana Ashram|ashram]] took place in 1931. During this visit, Hurst was accompanied by a Buddhist [[bhikshu]], formerly a military officer but meanwhile known as Swami Prajnananda, the founder of the English ashram in [[Rangoon]].
Hurst asked several questions, including "What is the way to God-realization?" and Maharshi said: "Vichara, asking yourself the 'Who am I?' enquiry into the nature of your Self."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arunachala.org/newsletters/1997/?pg=sep-oct Description of the visit and reproduction of one of the dialogues with the Maharshi, done from rough notes]&lt;/ref&gt;

''Paul Brunton'' was the pseudonym under which ''A Search in Secret India'' was published in 1934. The book became a bestseller, and Hurst afterwards stuck to publishing under this name.
 
Brunton has been credited with introducing Ramana Maharshi to the West through his books ''A Search in Secret India'' and ''The Secret Path''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kamath |first1=M. V. |last2=Kher |first2=V. B. |title=Sai Baba of Shirdi: A Unique Saint |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZcEJn3MLjcIC&amp;pg=PA298&amp;dq=Paul+Brunton+biography&amp;lr=#v=onepage&amp;q=Paul%20Brunton%20biography&amp;f=false |page=298 |year=2003 |publisher=Jaico Publishing House |isbn=9788172240301 |quote=Ramana Maharshi...was revealed to the wider world outside India by Paul Brunton... }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One day—sitting with Ramana Maharshi—Brunton had an experience which Steve Taylor names "an experience of genuine [[Enlightenment (spiritual)|enlightenment]] which changed him forever". Brunton describes it in the following way:
{{quote|I find myself outside the rim of world consciousness. The planet which has so far harboured me disappears. I am in the midst of an ocean of blazing light. The latter, I feel rather than think, is the primeval stuff out of which worlds are created, the first state of matter. It stretches away into untellable infinite space, incredibly alive.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Brunton in his book ''A Search in Secret India'', p.305, cited by Steve Taylor in his article [http://newdawnmagazine.com.au/Article/Satsang.html Satsang The Power of Spiritual Presence /in New Dawn Magazine No. 101 (Mar–Apr 2007)]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Brunton was in India during World War II, as a guest of the [[Maharaja of Mysore]],  [[Krishna Raja Wadiyar IV]].&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey M. Masson (1999), ''Der Guru meines Vaters, Eine Kindheit mit Paul Brunton'', Berlin, Theseus, {{ISBN|3-89620-144-1}}, p. 25&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Annie Cahn Fung, ''Paul Brunton A Bridge Between India and the West'', Part I: Genesis of a Quest, Chapter 3: In Mysore&lt;/ref&gt; He dedicated his book ''The Quest of the Overself'' to the Maharaja and when the Maharaja died in 1940, he was present at his funeral.&lt;ref&gt;[http://paulbrunton.org/notebooks/para/18794 "Notebooks of Paul Brunton, Category 15: The Orient"], Chapter 2, p.453&lt;/ref&gt;

Brunton was critical of Mahatma Gandhi and the Indian independence movement:
{{quote|I discover, too, that he has not yet succumbed to the hysteria for politics which has attacked most of the young students in the towns, though India is now in the throes of the long turmoil which Gandhi has aroused into being in his effort to disturb the relations between white rulers and brown ruled.&lt;ref&gt;Brunton, Paul. ''A Search in Secret India'', p. 165&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In the 1940s and 1950s, Brunton occasionally stayed as a guest, for a few weeks at a time, about six months total, with the parents of controversial American author and former psychoanalyst [[Jeffrey Moussaieff Masson|Jeffrey Masson]]. In 1956, Brunton decided that a third world war was imminent and the Massons moved to [[Montevideo]], since this location was considered safe. From [[Uruguay]], Masson went with Brunton's encouragement to study Sanskrit at Harvard. Brunton himself did not move to South America, instead spending some time living in [[New Zealand]]. In 1993, Masson wrote a critical account of Brunton titled ''My Father's Guru: A Journey Through Spirituality and Disillusion''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://adyar.com.au/adyar/articles.cfm?article_id=75 "In 1963, after several years of travelling and living in the United States, Australia and New Zealand, Brunton withdrew to the serenity of the Swiss Alps."] [[Adyar Bookshop|Adyar]] online.
{{cite book |title=Yoga Journal |date=Sep–Oct 1993 |page=116 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZukDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA116  |quote=This is a critical account of growing up with a guru in the house. Yet that "guru" who by his own account never accepted "disciples" and only ever called himself a "student" of the subjects he was writing about, spent a total of only six months as a house-guest of the Massons, staying no more than a few weeks at a time during the period in question. Thus Masson either sincerely--from a small child's perspective at the time; or wilfully distorted the facts. Anyone who knows Brunton knows he never claimed to be anyone's guru, and remained fiercely independent in his thoughts and movements. |issn=0191-0965 |volume=112 |publisher=Active Interest Media Inc. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1950s, Brunton retired from publishing books and devoted himself to writing essays and notes.  Upon his death in 1981 in [[Vevey, Switzerland]], it was noted that in the period since the last published book in 1952, he had rendered about 20,000 pages of philosophical writing.

A longtime friend of Brunton's, philosopher Anthony Damiani, founded ''Wisdom's Goldenrod Center for Philosophic Studies'' in 1972.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wisdomsgoldenrod.org/about.html#anthony Wisdom's Goldenrod Center for Philosophic Studies]&lt;/ref&gt;  Swedish-American publisher Robert Larson started publishing the 16-volume set in 1984.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3098">'''Paul Henry Maty''' (1744, [[London]] - 16 January 1787) was an [[England|English]] [[librarian]].

He was born in London, the son of the librarian [[Matthew Maty]] (1718-1786) and was educated at [[Trinity College, Cambridge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{acad|id=MTY763PH|name=Matty &lt;nowiki&gt;[or Maty]&lt;/nowiki&gt;, Paul Henry}}&lt;/ref&gt; He vacated a Trinity fellowship to marry in 1775. In 1777 he published his religious doubts about the [[39 articles]] in the ''[[Gentleman's Magazine]]''.  With his Ecclesiastical advancement thus impeded, he became an assistant librarian, and then under-librarian, at the [[British Museum]]. 

He was elected a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]] in May, 1771. &lt;ref&gt; {{cite web|url=http://www2.royalsociety.org/DServe/dserve.exe?dsqIni=Dserve.ini&amp;dsqApp=Archive&amp;dsqCmd=Show.tcl&amp;dsqDb=Persons&amp;dsqPos=1&amp;dsqSearch=%28Surname%3D%27maty%27%29|title= Library and Archive|publisher= Royal Society|accessdate= 2 October 2010}} &lt;/ref&gt; He also obtained the job of foreign secretary, and subsequently general secretary, to the Society - although taking [[Charles Hutton]]'s side in his dispute with the president [[Joseph Banks]] forced Maty's resignation in 1784.

From 1782 to 1786 Maty founded, edited and was primary author of a review journal, ''[[A New Review]]: with Literary Curiosities and Literary Intelligence''. He indexed the ''[[Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society|Philosophical Transactions]]'', collaborated with [[Samuel Ayscough]] on a catalogue of the British Museum's printed books, and translated the ''Travels through Germany'' of [[Johann Kaspar Riesbeck]] (1754-1786). Some  of his sermons were posthumously published by [[Samuel Horsley]].

On his death he was buried in [[Bunhill Fields]]

'''Raj Kiran Mahtani''' is a former [[India]]n actor who is recognised for his work in [[Bollywood]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bollywoodmdb.com/celebrities/raj-kiran/7056|title=Raj Kiran - BollywoodMDB|website=www.bollywoodmdb.com|language=en|access-date=2018-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cinestaan.com/people/raj-kiran-2077|title=Raj Kiran movies, filmography, biography and songs - Cinestaan.com|website=Cinestaan|access-date=2018-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2011-06-01/news-interviews/29607832_1_raj-kiran-rishi-kapoor-film After Raj Kiran, we find the memories - Times Of India]. Articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com (1 June 2011). Retrieved on 30 May 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;  Born in a [[Sindhi people|Sindhi]] family in Mumbai, he made his debut opposite [[Sarika]] in [[B. R. Ishara]]'s ''[[Kaagaz Ki Nao]]'' (1975) and achieved the crest of his career in the 1980s, having appeared in more than 100 films.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Throughout his career, he accepted leading as well as supporting roles. He was loved for his leading roles in films such as ''[[Kaagaz Ki Nao]]'' (1975), ''[[Shikshaa]]'' (1979), ''Maan Abhiman'' (1980) and ''[[Ek Naya Rishta]]'' (1988) as well as being appreciated for his supporting roles in films such as ''[[Karz (film)|Karz]]'' (1980), ''[[Baseraa]]'' (1981), ''[[Arth (film)|Arth]]'' (1982) and ''[[Raaj Tilak]]'' (1984) to name a few. He was often typecasted as a romantic as well as kind-hearted hero, which was considered as his most loved image by viewers.

He disappeared from the industry and was thought to be living as a recluse in [[United States|USA]] for many years. [[Rishi Kapoor]] was reportedly told by Govind Mehtani, the brother of Raj Kiran that the actor was in [[Atlanta]] in an asylum where he was living due to a mental illness. In 2011, his daughter issued a public statement negating the reports of Raj Kiran being found in [[Atlanta]]. She and her family have been looking for him with the assistance of [[New York (state)|New York]] police and private detectives for the last eight years.

Raj Kiran made his debut opposite [[Sarika]] in [[B. R.

In 1980, he hit the theatre with his successive eight releases — ''[[Karz (film)|Karz]]'', ''Bambai Ka Maharaja'', ''Maan Abhiman'', ''Manokamnaa'', ''Nazrana Pyar Ka'', ''Patita'', ''Saajan Mere Main Saajan Ki'' and ''Yeh Kaisa Insaaf''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gomolo.com/raj-kiran-movies-list-filmography/10969|title=Raj Kiran Filmography, Raj Kiran List Of Movies On Gomolo.com|website=gomolo.com|access-date=2018-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the beginning of 1990s, his career began to slow down. Further, he made his television debut in the [[Shekhar Suman]] starrer, much acclaimed TV series ''Reporter'' (1994).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.freeonlineindia.in/reporter-old-doordarshan-tv-serial/|title=Reporter (Old Doordarshan TV Serial)|date=2016-11-01|work=Free Online India|access-date=2018-01-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disappearance==
Raj Kiran went into acute depression after his career had taken a backseat. Reportedly, the actor also went through a series of domestic crises. Later, he was admitted to Byculla Mental asylum in [[Mumbai]]. He disappeared from the industry and was thought to be living as a recluse in America for many years. [[Deepti Naval]] endeavoured to look for the missing actor through [[Facebook]] writing on her timeline, "Looking for a friend from the film world his name is Raj Kiran - we have no news of him - last heard he was driving a cab in NY city if anyone has any clue, please tell . . ."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

|quote = “I’ve been wondering where Raj had disappeared. The question was haunting me for a very long time. Then these rumours of Raj being no more began doing the rounds. I was really disturbed. How can a colleague with whom I shared a really good times, just vanish from the face of earth? I decided to look up Raj’s elder brother Govind Mahtani to find out about Raj. I was so relieved when Govind told me that Raj was alive. But he was confined to an institution in Atlanta due to health problems. ... apparently, he looks after his own treatment by working within the institution. It’s a heart-rending situation for an actor who was so successful at one time.”

In June, 2011, [[Rishi Kapoor]], on a trip to [[United States|USA]] made a phone call to the missing actor's brother Govind Mahtani, who told him that the actor was in Atlanta in an asylum where he was living due to a mental illness. He refused to give any more details.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hindustantimes.com/Rishi-to-help-Raj-Kiran-return-to-B-town/Article1-705294.aspx Rishi to help Raj Kiran return to B-town].

'''Sonia Sanjinez de Atala''' (born c. 1951) is a Bolivian former [[drug trafficker]]. A member of "[[La Corporación]]" ("The Corporation"), Atala was one of the [[Drug lord|narcos]] responsible for the 1980 Bolivian coup d'état, known as the "Cocaine Coup", and the most powerful female drug lord in Bolivia at the time.

==Criminal career==
Atala was born in Santa Cruz, Bolivia. She was the niece of drug trafficker Hugo Hurtado-Candia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.consortiumnews.com/archive/moon6.html|title=The Consortium|website=www.consortiumnews.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She sold television sets and radios to Panama before she was hired by Luis Arce Gomez to smuggle drugs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://javierbadani.blogspot.com/2013/07/la-reina-de-la-cocaina-fue-boliviana.html|title=SUEÑOS PARA ATAR: LA REINA DE LA COCAÍNA FUE BOLIVIANA|date=18 July 2001|website=Javierbadani.blogpsot.com|accessdate=25 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was imprisoned in [[La Paz]] under the presidency of [[Lidia Gueiler Tejada]], but for a short period. 
 
After the "Cocaine Coup" in 1980, installed by various Bolivian drug kingpins, Minister of the Interior [[Luis Arce Gomez]] put Atala in charge of smuggling cocaine and [[money laundering]] operations across the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.borderlandbeat.com/2013/07/the-women-of-organized-crime.html|title=The Women of Organized Crime|website=Borderlandbeat.com|accessdate=25 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; She paid her smugglers $20,000 monthly with a $500 tax for each kilogram of cocaine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1990-01-04/news/9001170497_1_bolivian-cocaine-cocaine-trafficker-luis-arce-gomez|title=Documents: Retaliation Threatened Bolivian Charged In Cocaine Conspiracy|website=Articles.sun-sentinel.com|accessdate=25 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

According to ex-DEA agent [[Michael Levine (DEA)|Michael Levine]] (later her undercover partner), Atala was described as a "very beautiful but deadly woman" who could order people dead anywhere in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mail-archive.com/ctrl@listserv.aol.com/msg02559.html|title=[CTRL] Michael Levine - The DEA's Exiled Dissident|website=www.mail-archive.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her mansion in Santa Cruz was known as the "Torture House" due to her enforcers taking in enemies and torturing them. Atala was protected by an enforcer group made of Neo-Nazi mercenaries trained by [[Klaus Barbie]].

In the mid-1980s, a period where Atala grew too powerful, the Bolivian narco government betrayed her during a cocaine deal with the [[Medellin Cartel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://narcosphere.narconews.com/notebook/bill-conroy/2012/10/murder-miami-s-cocaine-queen-offers-teaching-moment|title=Murder of Miami’s ‘Cocaine Queen’ Offers Teaching Moment - the narcosphere|website=Narcosphere.narconews.com|accessdate=25 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Atala was on the run from Luis Fernando Arcila Mejia ("Papa Mejia"), a Colombian drug smuggler whom Atala had refused to pay off a drug operation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mail-archive.com/ctrl@listserv.aol.com/msg02559.html|title=[CTRL] Michael Levine - The DEA's Exiled Dissident|website=Mail-archive.com|accessdate=25 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Atala was present as a key witness at the trial of Luis Arce Gomez, who pleaded guilty to drug trafficking charges, and received a lighter sentence in return for incriminating information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.upi.com/Archives/1990/01/04/Minister-of-Cocaine-threatened-retaliation/6078631429200/|title='Minister of Cocaine' threatened retaliation|website=Upi.com|accessdate=25 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is currently under a [[witness protection program]] and resides in Santa Cruz, Bolivia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://redtea.com/news/living-in-bolivia/|title=Living in… Bolivia|date=11 July 2014|website=Redtea.com|accessdate=25 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Atala married auto driver Walter "Pachi" Atala when she was 14 years old. They had four children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://javierbadani.blogspot.com/2013/07/la-reina-de-la-cocaina-fue-boliviana.html|title=SUEÑOS PARA ATAR: LA REINA DE LA COCAÍNA FUE BOLIVIANA|date=18 July 2001|website=Javierbadani.blogpsot.com|accessdate=25 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2669">'''Theodoros Negris''' ({{lang-el|Θεόδωρος Νέγρης}}, [[Istanbul|Constantinople]], 1790 – [[Nafplio]], 22 November 1824{{Greece Old Style dating}}) was a Greek politician.

==Biography==
He was born in [[Istanbul|Constantinople]] and descended from  an old noble family of [[Genoa]]. The family's wealth allowed him to receive a good education. In 1818 he was initiated into [[Filiki Eteria]] (Society of Friends) and became one of its most active members. He served as secretary to the [[hospodar]] of [[Moldavia]] [[Scarlat Callimachi (hospodar)|Scarlat Callimachi]], and in early 1821 he was appointed Ottoman envoy to [[Paris]]. On his way, however, he received news on the outbreak of the  [[Greek War of Independence]], and went secretly to Greece. Following the [[Constantinople massacre of 1821|massacre]] against the Greek population in Constantinople, his father was beheaded by the Ottomans.

Negris arrived on the island of [[Spetses]] in Ottoman dress, and was almost lynched by the crowd, but was saved by Neofytos Vamvas. Although he spread the false rumour that he was a relative of [[Demetrios Ypsilantis]], he soon joined with fellow [[Phanariotes]] [[Alexandros Mavrokordatos]] and [[Kostakis Karatzas]] in an informal political alliance directed against Ypsilantis. On 19 November 1821, he participated in the establishment of the [[Areopagus of Eastern Continental Greece]], becoming its first president.

He took part in the [[First National Assembly at Epidaurus]] and the [[Second National Assembly at Astros]], after which he switched camps and allied with [[Theodoros Kolokotronis]] and [[Odysseas Androutsos]] against Mavrokordatos. As the power of the Areopagus declined in favour of the central provisional government, so Negris too began to be sidelined and lose his influence.

He died on 22 November 1824 of [[typhus]] in [[Nafplio]].

'''Winfield Scott Hancock''' (February 14, 1824 – February 9, 1886) was a career [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] officer and the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] nominee for [[President of the United States]] in [[United States presidential election, 1880|1880]]. He served with distinction in the Army for four decades, including service in the [[Mexican–American War]] and as a [[Union Army|Union]] [[General (United States)|general]] in the [[American Civil War]]. Known to his Army colleagues as "Hancock the Superb",&lt;ref name=Eicher&gt;Eicher, pp. 277–78.&lt;/ref&gt; he was noted in particular for his personal leadership at the [[Battle of Gettysburg]] in 1863. One military historian wrote, "No other Union general at Gettysburg dominated men by the sheer force of their presence more completely than Hancock."&lt;ref name=Tagg&gt;Tagg, pp. 33–35.&lt;/ref&gt; As another wrote, "his tactical skill had won him the quick admiration of adversaries who had come to know him as the 'Thunderbolt of the [[Army of the Potomac]]'."&lt;ref&gt;Tucker, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; His military service continued after the Civil War, as Hancock participated in the military [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]] of [[Southern United States|the South]] and the Army's presence at the Western [[Frontier#United States|frontier]].

Hancock's reputation as a war hero at Gettysburg, combined with his status as a Unionist and supporter of states' rights, made him a potential presidential candidate. His noted integrity was a counterpoint to the corruption of the era, for as President [[Rutherford B. Hayes]] said,&lt;blockquote&gt;If, when we make up our estimate of a public man, conspicuous both as a soldier and in civil life, we are to think first and chiefly of his manhood, his integrity, his purity, his singleness of purpose, and his unselfish devotion to duty, we can truthfully say of Hancock that he was through and through pure gold.&lt;ref&gt;Jordan, p. 319.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;When the Democrats nominated him for President in 1880,&lt;ref&gt;Tucker, pp. 300–301.&lt;/ref&gt; he ran a strong campaign, but was narrowly defeated by [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[James A. Garfield]].

==Early life and family==
Winfield Scott Hancock and his [[Twin#Monozygotic twins|identical twin]] brother Hilary Baker Hancock were born on February 14, 1824, in Montgomery Square, [[Pennsylvania]], a hamlet just northwest of [[Philadelphia]] in present-day [[Montgomery Township, Montgomery County, Pennsylvania|Montgomery Township]].&lt;ref name=jordan5&gt;Jordan, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; The twins were the sons of Benjamin Franklin Hancock and Elizabeth Hoxworth Hancock.&lt;ref name=Cluff&gt;Cluff, pp. 922–23.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Walker, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; Winfield was named after [[Winfield Scott]], a prominent general in the [[War of 1812]].&lt;ref name=jordan5/&gt;

The Hancock and Hoxworth families had lived in [[Montgomery County, Pennsylvania|Montgomery County]] for several generations, and were of [[English American|English]], [[Scottish American|Scottish]] and [[Welsh American|Welsh]] descent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last=Jenkins|first=Howard M.|title=Genealogical Sketch of General W.S. Hancock|journal=Pennsylvania Magazine of History and Biography|volume=X |pages=100 |year= 1886| url=https://books.google.com/?id=0Q4XAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA105&amp;dq=Russell+Dubois+Pennsylvania |accessdate=September 8, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Benjamin Hancock was a schoolteacher when his sons were born. A few years after their birth, he moved the family to [[Norristown, Pennsylvania|Norristown]], the county seat, and began to practice law.&lt;ref name=jordan5/&gt; Benjamin was also a deacon in the [[Baptist]] church and participated in municipal government (as an avowed [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]]).&lt;ref name=jordan5/&gt;

Hancock was at first educated at [[Norristown Academy]], but removed to the [[Public school (government funded)|public schools]] when the first one opened in Norristown in the late 1830s.&lt;ref&gt;Jordan, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1840, [[Joseph Fornance]], the local Congressman, nominated Hancock to the [[United States Military Academy]] at [[West Point, New York|West Point]].&lt;ref&gt;Tucker, pp. 18–21; Walker, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; Hancock's progress at West Point was average. He graduated 18th in his class of 25 in 1844, and he was assigned to the [[infantry]].&lt;ref&gt;Jordan, pp. 10–11; Walker, pp. 12–15; [http://sunsite.utk.edu/civil-war/wpclasses.html list of West Point officers in the Civil War] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090605014434/http://sunsite.utk.edu/civil-war/wpclasses.html |date=June 5, 2009 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early military career==

===Mexican War===
Hancock was commissioned a [[Brevet (military)|brevet]] [[Second Lieutenant#United States|second lieutenant]] in the [[6th Infantry Regiment (United States)|6th U.S. Infantry]] regiment, and initially was stationed in [[Indian Territory]] in the [[Red River of the South|Red River]] Valley. The region was quiet at the time, and Hancock's time there was uneventful.&lt;ref&gt;Jordan, p. 13; Walker, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; Upon the outbreak of [[Mexican–American War|war with Mexico]] in 1846, Hancock worked to secure himself a place at the front.&lt;ref name=jordan13&gt;Jordan, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; Initially assigned to recruiting duties in [[Kentucky]], he proved so adept at signing up soldiers that his superiors were reluctant to release him from his post.&lt;ref name=jordan14&gt;Jordan, p. 14; Walker, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; By July 1847, however, Hancock was permitted to join his regiment in [[Puebla, Puebla|Puebla]], Mexico, where they made up a part of the army led by his namesake, General [[Winfield Scott]].&lt;ref name=jordan14/&gt;

Scott's army moved farther inland from Puebla unopposed and attacked [[Mexico City]] from the south. During that campaign in 1847, Hancock first encountered battle at [[Battle of Contreras|Contreras]] and [[Battle of Churubusco|Churubusco]].&lt;ref&gt;Jordan, pp. 15–16.&lt;/ref&gt; He was appointed a brevet [[First Lieutenant#United States|first lieutenant]] for gallant and meritorious service in those actions.&lt;ref&gt;Jordan, p. 16; Walker, p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; Hancock was wounded in the knee at Churubusco and developed a fever.&lt;ref name=Eicher/&gt; Although he was well enough to join his regiment at [[Battle of Molino del Rey|Molino del Rey]], fever kept Hancock from participating in the final [[Battle of Chapultepec|breakthrough to Mexico City]], something he would regret for the rest of his life.&lt;ref&gt;Jordan, pp. 16–17.&lt;/ref&gt; After the final victory, Hancock remained in Mexico with the 6th Infantry until the [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo|treaty of peace]] was signed in 1848.&lt;ref&gt;Jordan, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marriage and peacetime===
Hancock served in a number of assignments as an army [[United States Army Quartermaster Corps|quartermaster]] and [[adjutant]], mostly in [[Fort Snelling, Minnesota|Fort Snelling]], [[Minnesota]] and [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]], [[Missouri]].&lt;ref&gt;Tucker, p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt; It was in St. Louis that he met Almira ("Allie") Russell and they married on January 24, 1850.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, pp. 21–22.&lt;/ref&gt; Allie gave birth to two children, Russell in 1850 and Ada in 1857, but both children died before their parents.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; Hancock was promoted to [[Captain (U.S. Army)|captain]] in 1855 and assigned to [[Fort Myers, Florida|Fort Myers]], [[Florida]].&lt;ref&gt;Jordan, p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; Hancock's young family accompanied him to his new posting, where Allie Hancock was the only woman on the post.&lt;ref&gt;Jordan, p. 25; Hancock, pp. 24–27.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hancock's tour in Florida coincided with the end of the [[Seminole War|Third Seminole War]]. His duties were primarily those of a [[quartermaster]], and he did not see action in that campaign.&lt;ref name=jordan25&gt;Jordan, p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; As the situation in Florida began to settle down, Hancock was reassigned to [[Fort Leavenworth]], [[Kansas]].&lt;ref name=jordan25/&gt; He served in the West during the partisan warfare of "[[Bleeding Kansas]]", and in the [[Utah Territory]], where the 6th Infantry arrived after the [[Utah War]].&lt;ref name=Cluff/&gt; Following the resolution of that conflict, Hancock was stationed in southern [[California]] in November 1858.&lt;ref&gt;Jordan, pp. 26–27.&lt;/ref&gt; He remained there, joined by Allie and the children, until the Civil War broke out in 1861, serving as a captain and assistant quartermaster under future [[Confederate States Army|Confederate]] General [[Albert Sidney Johnston]].&lt;ref Name=Eicher/&gt; In California, Hancock became friendly with a number of southern officers, most significantly [[Lewis A. Armistead]] of [[Virginia]].&lt;ref&gt;Jordan, pp. 28–32.&lt;/ref&gt; At the outbreak of the Civil War, Armistead and the other southerners left to join the [[Confederate States Army]], while Hancock remained in the service of the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Jordan, pp. 33–34.&lt;/ref&gt;

| style="text-align: left;" |Hancock stands the most conspicuous figure of all the general officers who did not exercise a separate command. He commanded a corps longer than any other one, and his name was never mentioned as having committed in battle a blunder for which he was responsible. He was a man of very conspicuous personal appearance.... His genial disposition made him friends, and his personal courage and his presence with his command in the thickest of the fight won for him the confidence of troops serving under him. No matter how hard the fight, the 2nd corps always felt that their commander was looking after them.

[[File:WScottHancock.jpg|thumb|left|General Winfield Scott Hancock]]
Hancock returned east to assume quartermaster duties for the rapidly growing [[Union Army]], but was quickly promoted to [[Brigadier General#United States|brigadier general]] on September 23, 1861, and given an [[infantry]] [[brigade]] to command in the division of Brig. Gen. [[William Farrar Smith|William F. "Baldy" Smith]], [[Army of the Potomac]].&lt;ref name=Eicher/&gt; He earned his "Superb" nickname in the [[Peninsula Campaign]], in 1862, by leading a critical counterattack in the [[Battle of Williamsburg]]; army commander [[Major general (United States)|Maj. Gen.]] [[George B. McClellan]] telegraphed to Washington that "Hancock was superb today" and the appellation stuck.&lt;ref name=Tagg/&gt; McClellan did not follow through on Hancock's initiative, however, and Confederate forces were allowed to withdraw unmolested.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, pp. 41–42.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Battle of Antietam]], Hancock assumed command of the 1st Division, [[II Corps (Union Army)|II Corps]], following the mortal wounding of Maj. Gen. [[Israel B. Richardson]] in the horrific fighting at "Bloody Lane". Hancock and his staff made a dramatic entrance to the battlefield, galloping between his troops and the enemy, parallel to the Sunken Road.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, pp. 51–52.&lt;/ref&gt; His men assumed that Hancock would order counterattacks against the exhausted Confederates, but he carried orders from McClellan to hold his position.&lt;ref&gt;Sears, p. 257.&lt;/ref&gt; He was promoted to major general of volunteers on November 29, 1862.&lt;ref name=Eicher/&gt; He led his division in the disastrous attack on Marye's Heights in the [[Battle of Fredericksburg]] the following month and was wounded in the abdomen. At the [[Battle of Chancellorsville]], his division covered Maj. Gen. [[Joseph Hooker]]'s withdrawal and Hancock was wounded again.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, pp. 81–91&lt;/ref&gt; His corps commander, Maj. Gen. [[Darius N. Couch]], transferred out of the Army of the Potomac in protest of actions Hooker took in the battle and Hancock assumed command of II Corps, which he would lead until shortly before the war's end.&lt;ref name=Tagg/&gt;

===Gettysburg===
Hancock's most famous service was as a new corps commander at the [[Battle of Gettysburg]], July 1 to 3, 1863.&lt;ref name=Tagg/&gt; After his friend, Maj. Gen. [[John F. Reynolds]], was killed early on July 1, Maj. Gen. [[George G. Meade]], the new commander of the Army of the Potomac, sent Hancock ahead to take command of the units on the field and assess the situation. Hancock thus was in temporary command of the "left wing" of the army, consisting of the [[I Corps (Union Army)|I]], II, [[III Corps (Union Army)|III]], and [[XI Corps (Union Army)|XI Corps]]. This demonstrated Meade's high confidence in him, because Hancock was not the most senior Union officer at Gettysburg at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Jordan, p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt; Hancock and the more senior XI Corps commander, Maj. Gen. [[Oliver O. Howard]], argued briefly about this command arrangement, but Hancock prevailed and he organized the Union defenses on [[Cemetery Hill]] as more numerous Confederate forces drove the I and XI Corps back through the town. He had the authority from Meade to withdraw the forces, so he was responsible for the decision to stand and fight at Gettysburg.&lt;ref&gt;Tucker, pp. 131–134&lt;/ref&gt; At the conclusion of the day's action, Maj. Gen. [[Henry Warner Slocum]] arrived on the field and assumed command until Gen. Meade arrived after midnight.

On July 2, Hancock's II Corps was positioned on [[Cemetery Ridge]], roughly in the center of the Union line, while Confederate [[Full General (CSA)|General]] [[Robert E. Lee]] launched assaults on both ends of the line.&lt;ref name=jordan89&gt;Jordan, pp. 89–94.&lt;/ref&gt; On the Union left, [[Lieutenant General (CSA)|Lt. Gen.]] [[James Longstreet]]'s assault smashed the III Corps and Hancock sent in his 1st Division, under Brig. Gen. [[John C. Caldwell]], to reinforce the Union in the [[Battle of Gettysburg, Second Day#Wheatfield|Wheatfield]]. As Lt. Gen. [[A.P. Hill]]'s corps continued the attack toward the Union center, Hancock rallied the defenses and rushed units to the critical spots.&lt;ref name=jordan89/&gt; First, he issued the Third Brigade of his Third Division under Colonel George Willard into the fray to stop the advance of Confederate Brigadier General William Barksdale's Brigade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Reminiscences of Winfield Scott Hancock |last=Hancock |first=Almira |publisher=Digital Scanning, Inc. |year=1999 |isbn=1-58218-056-3 |location=Scituate, Massachusetts |pages=198}}&lt;/ref&gt; In one famous incident, he sacrificed a regiment, the [[1st Minnesota Volunteer Infantry|1st Minnesota Volunteer Infantry Regiment]], by ordering it to advance and charge a Confederate brigade four times its size, causing the Minnesotans to suffer 87% casualties.&lt;ref name=jordan93&gt;Jordan, p. 93.&lt;/ref&gt; While costly to the regiment, this heroic sacrifice bought time to organize the defensive line and saved the day for the Union army.&lt;ref name=jordan93/&gt; Following the action toward his right, he met the [[13th Vermont Infantry|13th Vermont Volunteer Infantry Regiment]],  a First Corps unit which had come from Cemetery Hill to help quell the crisis. Hancock sent them out to recover some artillery pieces Confederates had taken and were pulling away. The Vermonters were successful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Gettysburg: The Second Day |last=Pfanz |first=Harry |publisher=University of North Carolina Press |year=1987 |isbn=0-8078-1749-X |location=Chapel Hill, North Carolina |pages=422}}&lt;/ref&gt; Having stabilized his line, he turned his attention to the sound of fighting on East Cemetery Hill. There, with darkness falling, Confederates from Major General [[Jubal Early]]'s Division had gotten into Union batteries and were fighting the cannoneers hand-to-hand.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Gettysburg: Culp's Hill and Cemetery Hill|last = Pfanz|first = Harry|publisher = University of North Carolina Press|year = 1993|isbn = 0-8078-2118-7|location = Chapel Hill, North Carolina|pages = 269}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hancock sent the First Brigade of his Third Division, under Colonel Samuel S. Carroll, to the fighting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Gettysburg: Culp's Hill and Cemetery Hill|last = Pfanz|first = Harry|publisher = University of North Carolina Press|year = 1993|isbn = 0-8078-2118-7|location = Chapel Hill, North Crolina|pages = 263–264}}&lt;/ref&gt; The brigade was crucial in flushing the enemy out of the batteries and dispatching them back down the face of East Cemetery Hill.

On July 3, Hancock continued in his position on Cemetery Ridge and thus bore the brunt of [[Pickett's Charge]].&lt;ref&gt;Jordan, pp. 96–99.&lt;/ref&gt; During the massive Confederate artillery bombardment that preceded the infantry assault, Hancock was prominent on horseback in reviewing and encouraging his troops. When one of his subordinates protested, "General, the corps commander ought not to risk his life that way," Hancock is said to have replied, "There are times when a corps commander's life does not count."&lt;ref&gt;Foote, p. 545.&lt;/ref&gt; During the infantry assault, his old friend, now [[Brig. Gen. (CSA)|Brig. Gen.]] [[Lewis A. Armistead]], leading a brigade in [[Maj. Gen. (CSA)|Maj. Gen.]] [[George Pickett]]'s division, was wounded and died two days later. Hancock could not meet with his friend because he had just been wounded himself, a severe wound caused by a bullet striking the pommel of his saddle, entering his inner right thigh along with wood fragments and a large bent nail.&lt;ref&gt;Jordan, p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt; Helped from his horse by aides, and with a [[tourniquet]] applied to staunch the bleeding, he removed the saddle nail himself and, mistaking its source, remarked wryly, "They must be hard up for ammunition when they throw such shot as that."&lt;ref&gt;Foote, p. 561.&lt;/ref&gt; News of Armistead's mortal wounding was brought to Hancock by a member of his staff, Captain [[Henry H. Bingham]]. Despite his pain, Hancock refused evacuation to the rear until the battle was resolved. He had been an inspiration for his troops throughout the three-day battle. Hancock later received the thanks of the [[U.S. Congress]] for "...&amp;nbsp;his gallant, meritorious and conspicuous share in that great and decisive victory."&lt;ref Name=Eicher/&gt;

===Virginia and the end of the war===
[[File:Hancock et al.png|thumb|Hancock, surrounded by three of his division commanders: [[Francis C. Barlow]], [[David B. Birney]], and [[John Gibbon]] during the Wilderness campaign]]
Hancock suffered from the effects of his Gettysburg wound for the rest of the war.&lt;ref name=Tagg/&gt; After recuperating in Norristown, he performed recruiting services over the winter and returned in the spring to field command of the II Corps for Lt. Gen. [[Ulysses S. Grant]]'s 1864 [[Overland Campaign]], but he never regained full mobility and his former youthful energy.&lt;ref&gt;Jordan, p. 103.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, he performed well at the [[Battle of the Wilderness]] and commanded a critical breakthrough assault of the Mule Shoe at the "Bloody Angle" in the [[Battle of Spotsylvania Court House]] on May 12, shattering the Confederate defenders in his front, including the [[Stonewall Brigade]].&lt;ref&gt;Jordan, pp. 126–133.&lt;/ref&gt; His corps suffered enormous losses during a futile assault Grant ordered at [[Battle of Cold Harbor|Cold Harbor]].&lt;ref&gt;Jordan, pp. 136–139.&lt;/ref&gt;

After Grant's army slipped past Lee's army to cross the [[James River (Virginia)|James River]], Hancock found himself in a position from which he might have ended the war. His corps arrived to support [[William Farrar Smith]]'s assaults on the lightly held [[Petersburg, Virginia|Petersburg]] defensive lines, but he deferred to Smith's advice because Smith knew the ground and had been on the field all day, and no significant assaults were made before the Confederate lines were reinforced. One of the great opportunities of the war was lost.&lt;ref name=Cluff/&gt; After his corps participated in the assaults at [[First Battle of Deep Bottom|Deep Bottom]], Hancock was promoted to brigadier general in the [[Regular Army (United States)|regular army]], effective August 12, 1864.&lt;ref name=Eicher/&gt;

Hancock's only significant military defeat occurred during the [[Siege of Petersburg]]. His II Corps moved south of the city, along the [[Wilmington and Weldon Railroad]], tearing up track. On August 25, Confederate Maj. Gen. [[Henry Heth]] attacked and overran the faulty Union position at [[Second Battle of Ream's Station|Reams's Station]], shattering the II Corps, capturing many prisoners.&lt;ref&gt;Jordan, pp. 159–164.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite a later victory at [[Battle of Boydton Plank Road|Hatcher's Run]], the humiliation of Reams's Station contributed, along with the lingering effects of his Gettysburg wound, to his decision to give up field command in November.&lt;ref name=jordan169&gt;Jordan, pp. 169–173&lt;/ref&gt; He left the II Corps after a year in which it had suffered over 40,000 casualties, but had achieved significant military victories. His next assignment was to command the ceremonial [[First Veteran Corps]].&lt;ref name=jordan169/&gt; He performed more recruiting, commanded the Middle Department, and relieved Maj. Gen. [[Philip Sheridan]] in command of forces in the now-quiet [[Shenandoah Valley]].&lt;ref name=Cluff/&gt; He was promoted to brevet major general in the regular army for his service at Spotsylvania, effective March 13, 1865.&lt;ref name=Eicher/&gt;

==Post-war military service==

===Execution of Lincoln assassination conspirators===
[[File:Execution Lincoln assassins.jpg|thumb|The [[Capital punishment|execution]] of the [[Abraham Lincoln assassination|Lincoln assassination]] conspirators, July 7, 1865]]
At the close of the war, Hancock was assigned to supervise the execution of the [[Abraham Lincoln assassination|Lincoln assassination]] conspirators.&lt;ref&gt;Jordan, p. 177.&lt;/ref&gt; Lincoln had been assassinated on April 14, 1865, and by May 9 of that year, a military commission had been convened to try the accused.&lt;ref&gt;Trefousse, pp. 211–212; Jordan, pp. 176–177.&lt;/ref&gt; The actual assassin, [[John Wilkes Booth]], was already dead, but the trial of his co-conspirators proceeded quickly, resulting in convictions. President [[Andrew Johnson]] ordered the executions to be carried out on July 7. Although he was reluctant to execute some of the less-culpable conspirators, especially [[Mary Surratt]], Hancock carried out his orders, later writing that "every soldier was bound to act as I did under similar circumstances."&lt;ref&gt;Jordan, pp. 179–180; Tucker, p. 272.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Service on the Plains===
After the executions, Hancock was assigned command of the newly organized [[Middle Military Department]], headquartered in [[Baltimore]].&lt;ref&gt;Jordan, p. 182.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1866, on Grant's recommendation, Hancock was promoted to major general and was transferred, later that year, to command of the military [[Department of the Missouri]], which included the states of [[Missouri]], [[Kansas]], [[Colorado]], and [[New Mexico]].&lt;ref&gt;Jordan, pp. 183–84.&lt;/ref&gt; Hancock reported to [[Fort Leavenworth]], Kansas, and took up his new posting. Soon after arriving, he was assigned by General [[William Tecumseh Sherman|Sherman]] to lead an expedition to negotiate with the [[Cheyenne]] and [[Sioux]], with whom relations had worsened since the [[Sand Creek massacre]].&lt;ref&gt;Jordan, pp. 185–89.&lt;/ref&gt; The negotiations got off to a bad start, and after Hancock ordered the burning of an abandoned Cheyenne village in central Kansas, relations became worse than when the expedition had started.&lt;ref&gt;Jordan, p. 194; Walker, p. 296.&lt;/ref&gt; There was little loss of life on either side, but the mission could not be called a success.&lt;ref name=jordan198&gt;Jordan, pp. 198–99.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reconstruction===
[[File:Andrew Johnson.jpg|thumb|[[Andrew Johnson]] thought Hancock was the ideal Reconstruction general.]]
Hancock's time in the West was brief. President Johnson, unhappy with the way Republican generals were governing the South under [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]], sought replacements for them.&lt;ref&gt;Trefousse, pp. 289–90.&lt;/ref&gt; The general who offended Johnson the most was [[Philip Sheridan]], and Johnson soon ordered General Grant to switch the assignments of Hancock and Sheridan, believing that Hancock, a Democrat, would govern in a style more to Johnson's liking.&lt;ref name=jordan200&gt;Jordan, pp. 200–201.&lt;/ref&gt; Although neither man was pleased with the change, Sheridan reported to Fort Leavenworth and Hancock to [[New Orleans]].&lt;ref name=jordan200/&gt;

Hancock's new assignment found him in charge of the [[Fifth Military District]], covering [[Texas]] and [[Louisiana]]. Almost immediately upon arriving, Hancock ingratiated himself with the white conservative population by issuing his General Order Number 40 of November 29, 1867. In that order, written while traveling to New Orleans, Hancock expressed sentiments in support of President Johnson's policies, writing that if the residents of the district conducted themselves peacefully and the civilian officials perform their duties, then "the military power should cease to lead, and the civil administration resume its natural and rightful dominion."&lt;ref&gt;Jamieson, pp. 152–53.&lt;/ref&gt; The order continued:
{{blockquote|The great principles of American liberty are still the lawful inheritance of this people, and ever should be. The right of trial by jury, the habeas corpus, the liberty of the press, the freedom of speech, the natural rights of persons and the rights of property must be preserved. Free institutions, while they are essential to the prosperity and happiness of the people, always furnish the strongest inducements to peace and order.&lt;ref&gt;Jordan, p. 203.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Hancock's order encouraged white Democrats across the South who hoped to return to civilian government more quickly, but discomforted blacks and Republicans in the South who feared a return to the antebellum ways of conservative white dominance.&lt;ref&gt;Jordan, pp. 204–05; Tucker, pp. 279–284.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hancock's General Order Number 40 was quickly condemned by Republicans in Washington, especially by the [[Radical Republicans|Radicals]], while President Johnson wholeheartedly approved.&lt;ref name=jordan206&gt;Jordan, pp. 206–08; Walker, pp. 301–303.&lt;/ref&gt; Heedless of the situation in Washington, Hancock soon put his words into action, refusing local Republican politicians' requests to use his power to overturn elections and court verdicts, while also letting it be known that open insurrection would be suppressed.&lt;ref name=jordan206/&gt; Hancock's popularity within the Democratic party grew to the extent that he was considered a potential presidential nominee for that party in [[United States presidential election, 1868|the 1868 election]].&lt;ref&gt;Jordan, 213–228; Warner, p. 204.&lt;/ref&gt; Although Hancock collected a significant number of delegates at the 1868 convention, his presidential possibilities went unfulfilled. Even so, he was henceforth identified as a rare breed in politics: one who believed in the Democratic Party's principles of states' rights and limited government, but whose anti-secessionist sentiment was unimpeachable.&lt;ref&gt;Jordan, p. 212; Walker pp. 301–302.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Return to the Plains===
Following [[Ulysses S. Grant|General Grant's]] 1868 presidential victory, the Republicans were firmly in charge in Washington. As a result, Hancock found himself transferred, this time away from the sensitive assignment of reconstructing the South and into the relative backwater that was the [[Department of Dakota]].&lt;ref&gt;Jordan, p. 229.&lt;/ref&gt; The Department covered [[Minnesota]], [[Montana Territory|Montana]], and [[Dakota Territory|the Dakotas]]. As in his previous Western command, Hancock began with a conference of the Indian chiefs, but this time was more successful in establishing a peaceful intent.&lt;ref&gt;Jordan, pp. 220–21.&lt;/ref&gt; Relations worsened in 1870, however, as an army expedition committed [[Marias massacre|a massacre]] against the [[Blackfoot|Blackfeet]].&lt;ref&gt;Jordan, p. 232.&lt;/ref&gt; Relations with the [[Sioux]] also became contentious as a result of white encroachment into the [[Black Hills]], in violation of the [[Treaty of Fort Laramie (1868)|Treaty of Fort Laramie]].&lt;ref&gt;Jordan, pp. 233–34.&lt;/ref&gt; Still, war was averted, for the time being, and most of Hancock's command was peaceful.

It was during this tour that Hancock had the opportunity to contribute to the creation of [[Yellowstone National Park]]. In August 1870, he ordered the 2nd Cavalry at [[Fort Ellis]] to provide a military escort for General [[Henry D. Washburn]]'s planned exploration of the Yellowstone Region.  The expedition, which was a major impetus in creating the park, became known as the [[Washburn-Langford-Doane Expedition]]. Hancock's order led to the assignment of Lt. [[Gustavus Cheyney Doane]] and a troop of 5 cavalrymen from Fort Ellis to escort the expedition.  In 1871, Captain [[John W. Barlow]] during his exploration of the Yellowstone region formally named a summit on what would become the southern boundary of the park [[Mount Hancock (Wyoming)|Mount Hancock]] to honor the general's decision to provide the escort.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Whittlesey |first=Lee |title=Yellowstone Place Names |publisher=Wonderland Publishing Company |location=Gardiner, MT |isbn=1-59971-716-6|year=1996 |page=178}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Command in the East and political ambitions===
In 1872, [[George Meade|General Meade]] died, leaving Hancock the army's senior major general. This entitled him to a more prominent command, and President Grant, still desirous to keep Hancock from a Southern post, assigned him command of the [[Division of the Atlantic]], headquartered at [[Fort Columbus]] on [[Governors Island]], in [[New York City]].&lt;ref&gt;Jordan, p. 235; Tucker, p. 292.&lt;/ref&gt; The vast department covered the settled northeast area of the country and was militarily uneventful with the exception of the army's involvement in the [[Great Railroad Strike of 1877]]. When railroad workers went on strike to protest wage cuts, the nation's transportation system was paralyzed. The governors of Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and Maryland asked President Hayes to call in federal troops to re-open the railways. Once federal troops entered the cities, most of the strikers melted away, but there were some violent clashes.&lt;ref&gt;Jordan, pp. 242–50.&lt;/ref&gt;

All the while Hancock was posted in New York, he did his best to keep his political ambitions alive. He received some votes at the Democrats' [[1876 Democratic National Convention|1876 convention]], but was never a serious contender as New York governor [[Samuel J. Tilden]] swept the field on the second ballot.&lt;ref&gt;Jordan, p. 239.&lt;/ref&gt; The Republican candidate, [[Rutherford B. Hayes]], won the election, and Hancock refocused his ambition on 1880. The [[Electoral Commission (United States)|electoral crisis]] of 1876 and the subsequent end to Reconstruction in 1877 convinced many observers that the election of 1880 would give the Democrats their best chance at victory in a generation.&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, Lloyd, ''The Stolen Election: Hayes versus Tilden–1876'', Agberg, Ltd. 1968, pp. 199–213.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Democratic convention===
Hancock's name had been proposed several times for the Democratic nomination for president, but he never captured a majority of delegates. In 1880, however, Hancock's chances improved. President Hayes had promised not to run for a second term, and the previous Democratic nominee, Tilden, declined to run again due to poor health.&lt;ref&gt;Jordan, pp. 255–59.&lt;/ref&gt; Hancock faced several competitors for the nomination, including [[Thomas A. Hendricks]], [[Allen G. Thurman]], [[Stephen Johnson Field]], and [[Thomas F. Bayard]]. Hancock's neutrality on the [[Gold standard#The gold exchange standard|monetary question]], and his lingering support in the South (owing to his General Order Number 40) meant that Hancock, more than any other candidate, had nationwide support.&lt;ref&gt;Jordan, p. 262.&lt;/ref&gt; When the [[1880 Democratic National Convention|Democratic convention]] assembled in [[Cincinnati, Ohio|Cincinnati]] in June 1880, Hancock led on the first ballot, but did not have a majority.&lt;ref name=walker306&gt;Walker, p. 306.&lt;/ref&gt; By the second ballot, Hancock received the requisite two-thirds, and [[William Hayden English]] of [[Indiana]] was chosen as his running mate.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, p. 306; Jordan, p. 281.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Campaign against Garfield===
[[File:1880DemocraticCampaignPoster.png|thumb|Hancock-English election poster]]
The Republicans [[1880 Republican National Convention|nominated]] [[James A. Garfield]], a Congressman from [[Ohio]] and a skillful politician. Hancock and the Democrats expected to carry the [[Solid South]], but needed to add a few of the Northern states to their total to win the election. The practical differences between the parties were few, and the Republicans were reluctant to attack Hancock personally because of his heroic reputation.&lt;ref&gt;Jordan, pp. 292–96; Walker, p. 307.&lt;/ref&gt; The one policy difference the Republicans were able to exploit was a statement in the Democratic platform endorsing "a [[Tariff in American history|tariff]] for revenue only".&lt;ref&gt;Jordan, p. 297.&lt;/ref&gt; Garfield's campaigners used this statement to paint the Democrats as unsympathetic to the plight of industrial laborers, a group that would benefit by a high protective tariff. The tariff issue cut Democratic support in industrialized Northern states, which were essential in establishing a Democratic majority.&lt;ref&gt;Jordan, pp. 297–301.&lt;/ref&gt; In the end, the Democrats and Hancock failed to carry any of the Northern states they had targeted, with the exception of [[New Jersey]]. Hancock lost the election to Garfield. Garfield polled only 39,213 more votes than Hancock, the popular vote being 4,453,295 for Garfield and 4,414,082 for Hancock. The electoral count, however, had a much larger spread: Garfield polled 214 electoral votes and Hancock only 155.&lt;ref&gt;Jordan, p. 306.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hancock took his electoral defeat in stride and attended Garfield's inauguration.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, p. 311.&lt;/ref&gt; Following the election, Hancock carried on as commander of the Division of the Atlantic. He was elected president of the [[National Rifle Association]] in 1881, explaining that "The object of the NRA is to increase the military strength of the country by making skill in the use of arms as prevalent as it was in the days of the Revolution."&lt;ref&gt;Kopel, ''National Review''.&lt;/ref&gt; Hancock was a Charter Director and the first president of the [[Military Service Institution of the United States]] from 1878 until his death in 1886.&lt;ref&gt;''Constitution, by-laws and register: together with memoranda relating to the history and work of the institution'', Military Service Institution of the United States, Governor's Island, N.Y.H., Wynkoop Hallenbeck Crawford co., 1906.&lt;/ref&gt; He was commander-in-chief of the [[Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States]] veterans organization from 1879 until his death in 1886. He was the author of ''Reports of Major General W. S. Hancock upon Indian Affairs'', published in 1867.&lt;ref name=Eicher/&gt; Hancock's last major public appearance was to preside over the funeral of President Grant in 1885, although he also made a less publicized trip that year to Gettysburg.&lt;ref&gt;Jordan, pp. 312–13.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hancock died in 1886 at Governors Island, still in command of the Military Division of the Atlantic, the victim of an infected [[carbuncle]], complicated by [[Diabetes mellitus|diabetes]].&lt;ref name=Tagg/&gt;&lt;ref name=Cluff/&gt; He is buried in [[Montgomery Cemetery (West Norriton Township, Pennsylvania)|Montgomery Cemetery]] in [[West Norriton Township, Montgomery County, Pennsylvania]], near [[Norristown, Pennsylvania|Norristown]], [[Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref name=Eicher/&gt; Although he outlived both of his children, he was survived by the three grandchildren fathered by his son, Russell. Hancock's wife, Almira, published ''Reminiscences of Winfield Scott Hancock'' in 1887.

In 1893, Republican General [[Francis Amasa Walker|Francis A. Walker]] wrote,&lt;blockquote&gt;Although I did not vote for General Hancock, I am strongly disposed to believe that one of the best things the nation has lost in recent years has been the example and the influence of that chivalric, stately, and splendid gentleman in the [[White House]]. Perhaps much which both parties now recognize as having been unfortunate and mischievous during the past thirteen years would have been avoided had General Hancock been elected.&lt;ref&gt;They Also Ran, Irving Stone, pg. 188&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The original Winfield Scott Hancock Elementary School, located at Arch and East Spruce Streets in Norristown, Pennsylvania, was built in 1895 in memory of the General who grew up not far from the site. It was replaced in 1962 by a new building still in use by the [[Norristown Area School District]] only a few blocks away at Arch and Summit Streets, which is also named after General Hancock.  The original 1895 building still stands and is used by a community non-profit organization.
