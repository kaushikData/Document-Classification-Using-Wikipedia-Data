'''''All I Wanna Do''''' (originally titled '''''The Hairy Bird''''') is a 1998 [[comedy film]] written and directed by [[Sarah Kernochan]]. It stars [[Kirsten Dunst]], [[Gaby Hoffman]], [[Monica Keena]], [[Heather Matarazzo]] and [[Rachael Leigh Cook]] in an [[ensemble cast]] as students of the fictional Miss Godard's [[University-preparatory school|Preparatory School]] for Girls, and [[Lynn Redgrave]] as the school's [[headmaster|headmistress]]. The film takes place in 1963 and focuses on several students' plotting and sabotage of a proposed [[merger]] for the school to go [[coed]].

Originally titled ''The Hairy Bird'', the film's screenplay, set in 1963, is based loosely on Kernochan's experiences at [[Rosemary Hall (Greenwich, Connecticut)|Rosemary Hall]] around that time. Filming was done in [[Toronto]], Ontario, Canada at the [[Trafalgar Castle School]] in [[Whitby, Ontario|Whitby]]. The song "The Hairy Bird" plays during the film's end credits; it was written by Kernochan and sung by a group which includes Kernochan and five of her Rosemary Hall classmates, including [[Glenn Close]].&lt;ref name="salon"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/entertainment/movies/int/2000/05/17/kernochan |work=[[Salon (website)|Salon]] |title=Girls' School Rules |date=17 May 2000 |author=Grossman, Pam |accessdate=August 10, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110806014609/http://www.salon.com/entertainment/movies/int/2000/05/17/kernochan |archivedate=6 August 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film was released in September 1998 in the United States under the title ''All I Wanna Do'', as its American distributor, [[Miramax|Miramax Films]], found the original title too offensive. In Canada, it was released under the title ''Strike!''.

==Plot==
In the fall of 1963 in [[New England]],  Odette "Odie" Sinclair is forcibly transferred by her parents to Miss Godard's Preparatory School for Girls after her parents find out that she has planned to have sex with her boyfriend, Dennis.  Upon arrival to the school, which is run by the stern but kind headmistress Miss McVane, Odette is introduced to her roommates, the intelligent and charismatic Verena von Stefan and the promiscuous Tinka Parker.  Verena and Tinka are the school's primary troublemakers; both mock an uptight [[hall monitor]] named Abigail "Abby" Sawyer, who has a penchant for tattletaling, and Verena regularly buys [[cigarettes]] from a lunch cook and is constantly late for classes.

After a brief [[hazing]] period, Odie is welcomed into the D.A.R. (Daughters of the American Ravioli), a club of several girls at the school who have greater aspirations than those of their peers; the members congregate in the school's attic, where they have access to canned ravioli stored above the cafeteria.  The club is led by Verena, and consists of several other girls, including Theresa "Tweety" Goldberg, a [[bulimic]] who self-induces vomiting by drinking [[ipecac]] syrup and plans to be a child psychologist; and Maureen "Momo" Haines, a well-spoken science nerd and aspiring biologist.  Verena has plans to start a fashion magazine like ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'', while Tinka plans to be an "actress-folk singer-slut".  Odette declares her interest in politics, but pines to finish what she started with Dennis and lose her virginity.

The D.A.R. begins planning a rendezvous for Odie and Dennis, but when it is discovered that Miss Godard's is considering going [[co-ed]] with the nearby St. Ambrose boys' academy, the girls become divided on the matter and ultimately the club breaks up, leaving Verena and Momo to plan a sabotage for an upcoming dance with the St. Ambrose boys.  Meanwhile, the board of [[trustees]] for the school, which include Abby's parents, deliberates on the matter.  Miss McVane detests the [[merger]], but can do little about it because of the school's financial problems.

As the St. Ambrose dance arrives, Verena and Momo concoct a plan to cast the boys' academy in a bad light, by spiking the fruit punch with alcohol from the [[chemistry]] lab and feeding them Tweety's ipecac to induce vomiting during their choir performance; Verena then plants empty liquor bottles in their school bus.  The same night, Dennis arrives at the academy dressed in a St. Ambrose uniform and meets Odette for their rendezvous in the attic of the school.

Tweety and Tinka have a change of heart on the co-ed integration after Tweety is humiliated by some St. Ambrose students.  With the help of a group of teenage male townies called "The Flat Critters", led by Snake who has a crush on Tinka, they end up sending the intoxicated St. Ambrose boys home with a poor reputation.  Miss McVane recognizes Verena as the mastermind behind the sabotage.  Despite Miss McVane's appreciation for Verena's efforts, she is forced to expel Verena for having been caught fraternizing in her undergarments with a St. Ambrose boy.

The following week at the end of the year ceremony, the announcement of the merger is made by Mrs. Sawyer, much to the disapproval of the girls, including Abby.  The students, led by Odie, hole up inside the school dormitories and demand a student body vote count as a single vote on the board of trustees.  Meanwhile, a media circus surrounds the school, and the board of trustees agree to a student vote.  Ultimately, the votes against the integration outnumber those for it, and the students donate their personal savings to help with the school's debt.

In a humorous epilogue prior to the credits, the following is revealed: Verena goes on to publish ''Moi'', one of the most-read women's publications in the world; Odette becomes a congresswoman and declares war on the [[tobacco industry]]; Momo is a scientist developing the first male oral [[contraceptive]]; Tinka, a famous actress, [[coming out of the closet|comes out]] to [[Barbara Walters]] in a 1997 interview; Tweety became a psychologist and wrote a best-seller about bulimia; Abby, a radical [[political activist]], is serving a prison sentence for a 1970 bank holdup; and Miss Godard's is still a girls school.

==Production==
''All I Wanna Do'' was filmed in 1997 in Toronto, primarily at the [[Trafalgar Castle School]] also at Loretto Abbey CSS (especially the chapel scenes), and was financed through [[Alliance Atlantis]] studios, a Canadian distribution company. 

==Release==
===Theatrical distribution===
The film was picked up by [[Miramax Films]] and was given a [[limited release]] in the United States on September 4, 1998 under the alternate title ''All I Wanna Do'',&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/library/film/032400wanna-film-review.html |work=[[The New York Times]] |title=`All I Wanna Do': With Sugar and Spice, and Ravioli Eaten Cold|author=Scott, A.O. |accessdate=September 19, 2018|date=March 24, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; as Miramax found the film's original working title, ''The Hairy Bird'' (which alluded to male genitalia), to be too offensive.&lt;ref name="salon" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.sarahkernochan.com/film/index.html |publisher=sarahkernochan.com |title=Sarah Kernochan: Feature Films |author=Kernochan, Sarah |accessdate=August 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was released in Canada and the United Kingdom under the title ''Strike!''. The only country to release the film under its original title was Australia.

In March 2000, the film was re-released in New York City&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://mrbrownmovies.com/movierpt66.html|title=The Movie Report Archive, Volume #66 |work=Mr. Brown Movie Archive |accessdate=9 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the United Artists Union Square Theater where it grossed $5,383 in its single week of screenings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=alliwannado.htm |work=[[Box Office Mojo]] |title=All I Wanna Do (2000) |accessdate= August 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Critical response===
A.O. Scott of ''[[The New York Times]]'' noted that the film "mixes such prim old-fashioned naughtiness with more consequential misbehavior...&amp;nbsp; ''All I Wanna Do'' lurches between girl-power melodrama and bratty farce, but the ungainliness is part of the film's charm."&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt; He also noted that the film is "surprisingly pleasant, thanks to smart, unstereotyped performances -- especially by Ms. Hoffmann and Ms. Dunst -- and the filmmaker's evident respect and affection for her characters."&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt;

Nathan Rabin of ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' favorably reviewed the film, noting that in its final act it "gains focus and momentum, becoming less a nostalgic celebration of female bonding than a boldly feminist teen sex comedy that isn't above the occasional group-vomiting scene. It improves steadily as it goes along, right up through an enormously satisfying ending that combines rousing rhetoric about the price of gender inequity and the power of group solidarity—and throws in a rowdy snobs vs. slobs setpiece worthy of ''[[Animal House]]''."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=[[The A.V.

==Gameplay==
[[File:BallJacksScreenshotTwoPlayerMode.PNG|left|thumb|250px|A two-player match is taking place.]]

This video game is a futuristic action game involving an ultra-competitive [[Sport|sporting event]]. Two [[robot]] crabs are controlled by men who play the game merely to become wealthy and famous.There is a conveyor belt behind them that spews [[metal]] balls at them. The goal is to capture balls that belong the opponent and keep them from him until time runs out.&lt;ref name="mobygames"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.giantbomb.com/ball-jacks/61-22748/ ''Ball Jacks''] at Giant Bomb&lt;/ref&gt; Balls can also be knocked out from the mechanical hands of the opponent. All damaged crabs must return to the pit area for a quick [[Maintenance, repair, and operations|maintenance and repair]] session.&lt;ref name="mobygames"/&gt;

There are several modes: a world championship against increasingly tougher opponents, a multiplayer versus mode, a training mode, and a [[time trial]] where the [[Time limit (video gaming)|time limit]] is the only foe.&lt;ref name="mobygames"/&gt;

The '''Berkeley Folk Music Festival''' was a [[folk music]] festival held annually from 1958 to 1970 in [[Berkeley, California]], one of the major centers of the folk music revival in the United States. It was directed by [[Barry Olivier]].

The Festival was one of the preeminent folk festivals on the West Coast, predating the more famous Newport Folk Festival on the East Coast and presenting performers, artists, and scholars such as [[Joan Baez]], [[Pete Seeger]], [[Doc Watson]], [[Alan Lomax]], [[Howlin' Wolf]], [[Phil Ochs]], [[Alice Stuart]], [[Jean Ritchie]], [[Jean Redpath]], [[Jesse Fuller]], [[Big Mama Thornton]], [[Mance Lipscomb]], [[Mississippi John Hurt]], [[Archie Green]], [[Alan Dundes]], [[Bess Lomax Hawes]], [[Ewan MacColl]], [[John Fahey (musician)|John Fahey]], [[Robbie Basho]], [[the Jefferson Airplane]], [[the Youngbloods]], [[Big Brother and the Holding Company]], [[Shlomo Carlebach (musician)|reb Shlomo Carlebach]], and many others. The festival's willingness to embrace electric rock music and other forms of what would become known as roots music or Americana makes it markedly different from Newport, with its famous struggle over [[Bob Dylan]] going electric. It exemplified the diverse and adventurous musical and cultural milieu of the West Coast—and the Bay Area in particular—and suggests a major revision in our understanding of the folk revival, of the relationship of culture to political events in Berkeley such as the [[Free Speech Movement]], to commerce and civil society, and to ongoing issues and questions about cultural heritage, technology, diversity, and commonality.

The '''British Theatre Playhouse (BTP)''' is a professional [[Theatre|theatrical]] and [[Musical theatre|musical]] production company incorporated in [[Singapore]] in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.singapore.doingbusinessguide.co.uk/market-experts/british-theatre-playhouse-pte-ltd|title=British Theatre Playhouse Pte.

The company has produced and presented a series of highly successful British productions in [[Singapore]], [[Malaysia]], [[Indonesia]], [[Thailand]], [[Sri Lanka]] and the [[UK]], and is currently looking to expand its production output in [[Hong Kong]] and [[India]]. Its aim is to continue bringing to the audience shows which feature stars and other prominent stage, television and film actors, or music performers, from [[London]]’s [[West End theatre|West End]], as it has been the case with all its shows so far,&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.castingcallpro.com/uk/company/105504/british-theatre-playhouse|title=British Theatre Playhouse|first=|last=info@blue-compass.com|publisher=|access-date=2015-10-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305011805/http://www.castingcallpro.com/uk/company/105504/british-theatre-playhouse|archive-date=2016-03-05|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; and presenting them in world-class hotels and other venues. So far, the BTP has produced 21 plays and musicals, making it a largely active production company, as it has been steadily achieving at least 2 productions per year since its foundation.

British Theatre Playhouse launched its branch office in Malaysia as the company has been bringing shows to Malaysia since 2005, so the new office will continue to work and grow the market.

== Founding history ==

The founders of the British Theatre Playhouse are Cecilia Leong-Faulkner&lt;ref name="britishtheatreplayhouse.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britishtheatreplayhouse.com/directors.html|title=British Theatre Playhouse - Directors - Professional theatre production company incorporated in Singapore in 2004 but is internationally focused with a strong British connection - SISTIC|publisher=|access-date=2015-10-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304040316/http://www.britishtheatreplayhouse.com/directors.html|archive-date=2016-03-04|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and John Faulkner.&lt;ref name="britishtheatreplayhouse.com"/&gt; Cecilia and John met in Kuala Lumpur in 1987 when Cecilia was working for American Express International in Kuala Lumpur which sponsored the play Bedroom Farce by Sir [[Alan Ayckbourn]] CBE and John was appearing in a dinner-theatre play at [[The Regent Hotel]] for the late British actor and producer [[Derek Nimmo]]. The idea for the foundation of the BTP came to them over a dinner one evening back in 2002, two years before the foundation of the BTP in 2004, when a comment was made about the absence of British plays in Singapore.

Cecilia has always enjoyed British theatre and music. Her love for the arts and culture sparked off in childhood, and one of her favourite magazines was [[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]], which introduced her to glossy lifestyle and people with interesting careers or hobbies. To her, art is culture, an expression of one’s dreams, inspiration, life and society. Cecilia is currently the Managing Director of the company. Previously, she worked as a Marketing Executive for [[American Express]] when she was living in Kuala Lumpur, then as a Marketing Manager for [[Wembley Stadium]] when she moved to live in London, then when she first moved to Singapore as a Marketing Manager for Magazines Inc., then as a Corporate Director of Marketing Communications for the luxury [[Banyan Tree Holdings|Banyan Tree Resorts and Spas]] again in Singapore, and as a Regional Advisor to the Association of Business Executives (ABE). At some point, she even formed her own marketing and PR firm called Cecilia Leong-Faulkner Marketing and PR Consultancy,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://singapore.company-archive.com/company-profile/cecilia-leong-faulkner-marketing-consultancy.EOw.html#sthash.YUGWuzUf.gbpl&amp;st_refDomain=www.facebook.com&amp;st_refQuery=/|title=Cecilia Leong-faulkner Marketing Consultancy (52864660E)|publisher=|access-date=2015-10-31|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304080249/http://singapore.company-archive.com/company-profile/cecilia-leong-faulkner-marketing-consultancy.EOw.html#sthash.YUGWuzUf.gbpl&amp;st_refDomain=www.facebook.com&amp;st_refQuery=/#sthash.YUGWuzUf.gbpl&amp;st_refDomain=www.facebook.com&amp;st_refQuery=/|archive-date=2016-03-04|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and thus she worked for various clients including the Six Senses Hotels, Resorts and Spas, for fashion events with the [[Singapore Tourism Board]], and for fashion designers such as Lawrence Steele, [[Neil Barrett (fashion designer)|Neil Barrett]] and [[Dean and Dan Caten|DSquared&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;]]. In addition to her background in magazine publishing with Magazines Inc., she has also been a freelance journalist writing articles for Singapore’s Women’s Weekly. She is a current Life Member of the Chinese Women’s Association in Singapore, which is well known for its fund-raising activities, and has served as the Honorary Secretary on the main committee. She also holds a Graduate Certificate in Hotel Management from [[Cornell University]], one of the top [[Ivy League]] universities in the US, and a Diploma in Business Management from the Association of Business Executives (ABE). She was recently asked to join the Leadership Business Group of Singapore's British Chamber of Commerce.

John Faulkner (also known by his equity performer’s name Richard Denning) was born and raised in London, and saw his career starting in London when he graduated from the [[Webber Douglas Academy of Dramatic Art]]. He has since worked as a producer, director and performer in London, UK, and in over twenty other countries. His London West End shows include e.g. Sir [[John Gielgud]]’s production of [[The Gay Lord Quex (play)|The Gay Lord Quex]] with [[Judi Dench]], and [[Me And My Girl]] at the [[Apollo Theatre]]. In London too, he performed his cabaret act featuring the songs of [[Noël Coward]], [[Cole Porter]], [[George Gershwin]] and many others of that period, at [[The Ritz London Hotel|The Ritz]], [[The Dorchester]] and [[Claridges Hotel]]. His overseas work includes the recital programme Remembrance for Shakespeare in the US with [[Princess Grace of Monaco]], which was also presented in London six months later in the presence of [[Prince Charles]] and [[Princess Diana]], and a year in Paris with [[Roland Petit]] and his wife [[Zizi Jeanmaire]] in their revue Zizi, Je T’Aime! at Le Casino de Paris. He produced and acted in Noël Coward’s [[Cowardy Custard]] in a national tour of Sweden in conjunction with the Swedish National Theatre. In Singapore, he co-founded the LaSalle School of Drama at LaSalle College of the Arts, and he was also the director of the Musical Theatre School, which offered recreational classes in song and dance for musical theatre to adults. He is currently the Artistic Director of the BTP.

Thanks to their long-standing promotion of the British culture in the area through the British Theatre Playhouse, Cecilia and John were also invited to meet [[Elizabeth II|The Queen]] and [[Prince Phillip]] on the occasion of the Queen’s State Visit to Singapore in March 2006.&lt;ref name="theroyalforums.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theroyalforums.com/forums/f118/queen-elizabeth-and-prince-philip-state-visit-to-singapore-march-16-18-2006-a-9169.html|title=Queen Elizabeth and Prince Philip: State Visit to Singapore - March 16-18, 2006 - The Royal Forums|publisher=|access-date=2015-10-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151101001051/http://www.theroyalforums.com/forums/f118/queen-elizabeth-and-prince-philip-state-visit-to-singapore-march-16-18-2006-a-9169.html|archive-date=2015-11-01|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On another occasion, Cecilia was invited to meet [[Prince William]] and his wife [[Kate Middleton]] when they officially visited Singapore in September 2012.&lt;ref name="asiaone.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.asiaone.com/News/Latest+News/Singapore/Story/A1Story20120911-370952.html|title=Prince William and Kate Middleton arrive in Singapore|website=news.asiaone.com|access-date=2015-10-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151106224035/http://news.asiaone.com/News/Latest+News/Singapore/Story/A1Story20120911-370952.html|archive-date=2015-11-06|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further to the above, Cecilia also collaborated with the welfare charity [[The Mission to Seafarers]] and was thus invited to meet its Royal Patron, [[Anne, Princess Royal|HRH Princess Anne]], at a reception on board the [[Royal Albatross (ship)|Royal Albatross]] yacht on 3 November 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.tallship.com.sg/media-coverage/princess-anne-provides-royal-glitz-to-mission-in-singapore/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2018-06-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180627145043/https://www.tallship.com.sg/media-coverage/princess-anne-provides-royal-glitz-to-mission-in-singapore/# |archive-date=2018-06-27 |dead-url=bot: unknown |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.tallship.com.sg/media-coverage/a-letter-from-buckingham-palace/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2018-06-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180627144528/https://www.tallship.com.sg/media-coverage/a-letter-from-buckingham-palace/# |archive-date=2018-06-27 |dead-url=bot: unknown |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; One year later, in November 2017, Cecilia was invited to meet [[Charles, Prince of Wales|HRH Prince Charles]] and his wife [[Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall]], when they officially visited Singapore as part of their Southeast Asia tour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/video/femail/video-1563942/Prince-Charles-Camilla-arrive-Singapore-Asia-tour.html|title=Prince Charles and Camilla arrive in Singapore on Asia tour - Daily Mail Online|website=Mail Online|access-date=2017-11-29|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171205193505/http://www.dailymail.co.uk/video/femail/video-1563942/Prince-Charles-Camilla-arrive-Singapore-Asia-tour.html|archive-date=2017-12-05|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The Definitive Rat Pack''===
In June and July 2018, the British Theatre Playhouse produced the Asian tour of The Definitive Rat Pack in Singapore, Kuala Lumpur and Dubai, in association with Worldwide Entertainment.

{{Norwegian-people}}
[[Norway]] has had a notable [[film|cinema]] industry for some time.

The first film produced domestically in Norway was a short about fishermen, ''[[Fiskerlivets farer]]'', dating from 1907.  The [[List of Norwegian films before 1930|first feature was released in 1911]], produced by Halfman Nobel Roede.&lt;ref&gt;Donald Dewey, [http://www.amscan.org/pdf/SR.Fall10-Fall-p18-36.pdf "Edging Out of Darkness" Norway’s Long Struggle to Establish a Thriving Film Industry"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120507034928/http://www.amscan.org/pdf/SR.Fall10-Fall-p18-36.pdf |date=2012-05-07 }}, ''Scandinavian Review'' ([[The American-Scandinavian Foundation]]), Autumn 2010, pp. 18, 30.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1931 [[Tancred Ibsen]], grandson of the playwright, presented Norway's first feature-length sound film, ''Den store barnedåpen'' ("The Great Christening").  Through the 1930s Ibsen "dominated" the nation's film industry,&lt;ref&gt;Nordic National Cinemas, edited by Gunnar Iverson, Astrid Soderbergh Widding, Tytti Soila, page 105&lt;/ref&gt; with [[Leif Sinding]] in second place.  Ibsen produced conventional melodramas more or less on the model of Hollywood films.

In the early 21st century a few Norwegian [[film directors]] have had the opportunity to go to [[Hollywood]] to direct various [[independent films]]. As of 2011, nearly 900 films had been produced in Norway, with a third of these being made in the last 15 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=International Film Guide 2012 |first=Ian Hayden |last=Smith |year= 2012 |isbn= 978-1908215017 |page= 177}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Commercial skipping''' is a feature of some [[digital video recorder]]s that makes it possible to automatically skip [[commercials]] in recorded programs. This feature created controversy, with [[Fox Broadcasting Co. v. Dish Network, LLC|major television networks and movie studios claiming it violates copyright]] and should be banned.

== History ==
After the [[video cassette recorder]] (VCR) became popular in the 1980s, the television industry began studying the impact of users [[fast forwarding]] through commercials. Advertising agencies fought the trend by making them more entertaining.&lt;ref name="deatley19850907"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=lc8vAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=1Y0DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5630%2C870934 | title=VCRs put entertainment industry into fast-forward frenzy | work=The Free Lance-Star | date=1985-09-07 | agency=Associated Press | accessdate=25 January 2015 | author=De Atley, Richard | pages=12-TV}}&lt;/ref&gt; For many years, video recorders manufactured for the [[Japan|Japanese]] market have been able to skip advertisements automatically, which is done by detecting when foreign language audio overdub tracks provided for many programmes go silent, as advertisements were broadcast with a single language only.

The first&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Here's Why Anthony Wood, Inventor of the DVR, Doesn't Use a DVR Anymore|url = https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaelwolf/2012/12/06/heres-why-anthony-wood-inventor-of-the-dvr-doesnt-use-a-dvr-anymore/|accessdate = 2015-09-29|first = Michael|last = Wolf}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[digital video recorder]] (DVR) with a built-in commercial skipping feature was [[ReplayTV]] with its "4000 Series" and "5000 Series" units.  In 2002, the main television networks and movie studios sued ReplayTV,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2012/05/tv-networks-say-youre-breaking-law-when-you-skip-commercials |title=TV Networks Say You're Breaking The Law When You Skip Commercials |website=Electronic Frontier Foundation|date=May 25, 2012 |author=Mitch Stoltz| |accessdate= 6 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; claiming that skipping advertisements during replay violates copyright. Later, five owners of ReplayTV represented by Electronic Frontier Foundation and attorneys Ira Rothken and Richard Wiebe countersued, asking the federal judge to uphold consumers' rights to record TV shows and skip commercials, claiming that features like commercial skipping help parents protect their kids from excessive [[consumerism]].  ReplayTV ended up filing for bankruptcy in 2003 after fighting a copyright infringement suit over the ReplayTV's ability to skip commercials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=eff.org|publisher=[[Electronic_Frontier_Foundation]]|title=Newmark et al. v. Turner Broadcasting System Inc. et al.|url=https://www.eff.org/cases/newmark-v-turner}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Commercial skipping software ===
In addition to the DVR devices which existed in the private market since the late 1990s, towards the mid-2000s, due to the significant advances in home computers, [[Home theater PC]]s started gaining popularity in the private market and many users began using their Home theater PCs in their living room for [[entertainment]] purposes.

Following this, many DVR programs were developed, including popular programs such as Windows Media Center, which contained all of the features of the DVR devices in addition to advanced features such as [[HDTV]] and the use of Multiple [[TV tuner card|TV Tuner Cards]]. Some independent developers began developing independent software capable of skipping the commercial segments when playing recorded videos, and permanently removing the commercial segments from recorded video files.

By 2014, many DVR programs such as [[Windows Media Center]], [[SageTV]] and [[MythTV]] had the capability to skip commercials segments in recorded TV broadcasts after installing [[Third-party software component|third-party add-ons]] such as [[DVRMSToolbox]], [[Comskip]] and [[ShowAnalyzer]], which use various advanced techniques to locate the commercial segments in the video files and save their locations to text files. The text files can also be fed into programs such as [[MEncoder]] or [[DVRMSToolboxGUI]] which can delete the commercial segments from the recorded video files.

A few third-party tools such as [[MCEBuddy]] automate detection and removal/marking of commercials.

One of the major weaknesses of commercial skippers is that, operating automatically, they may misidentify program material as a commercial and delete it. Most third-party programs do not allow manual fine-tuning of commercial segments locations before deletion. Some programs like [[MCEBuddy]] provide the ability to fine-tune commercial detection for groups of files (e.g. by channel or country) and provide tools to manually fine-tune commercial segments for individual files.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://discussion.mcebuddy2x.com/t/tuning-comskip-and-custom-comskip-inis-country-channel-specific/29 |title=MCEBuddy Tuning Comskip and Custom Comskip INI’s (Country / Channel specific)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2012, the US [[Dish Network]] began offering a DVR with what it calls [[Dish Network#Hopper|AutoHop]]. The device would automatically skip commercials when displaying programming that the viewer had previously recorded with the PrimeTime Anytime feature. It does not skip ads on any live programs. US broadcasters were angered at the news, and [[Fox Broadcasting Co. v. Dish Network, LLC|FOX embarked on legal action]]. Most, but not all, of Fox's claims were dismissed; ultimately an agreement was reached whereby AutoHop would only become available for Fox stations seven days after a program is transmitted; terms of the settlement were not disclosed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://variety.com/2016/biz/news/fox-broadcasting-dish-network-autohop-1201703348/ |title=Fox, Dish Settle Lawsuit Over Ad-Skipping, AutoHop |newspaper=Variety |date= 11 February 2016 |author= |accessdate= 6 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The future of TV advertisements==
The introduction of [[digital video recorder]]s and services with skipping and fast-forward capabilities enables viewers to avoid viewing interruptive advertisements in recorded programs, either manually or automatically. While advertising separate to television shows can be skipped, advertising in TV shows themselves ("[[product placement]]") cannot be skipped.  Streaming services such as [[Hulu]] show shorter advertisements with a countdown timer and tailored to the viewers interests, asking interactive questions like "Is this ad relevant to you?".

'''''Contract J.A.C.K.''''' is a prequel to the [[2002 in video games|2002]] computer game ''[[No One Lives Forever 2: A Spy In H.A.R.M.'s Way]]''. It was developed by [[Monolith Productions]] and published by [[Sierra Entertainment]], a subsidiary of [[Vivendi Universal Games]]. ''J.A.C.K.'' (Just Another Contract Killer) is set in the time frame between the events of the original ''[[No One Lives Forever]]'' and ''[[No One Lives Forever 2]]''.

== Story ==
The game follows John Jack, a professional killer recruited by H.A.R.M., a criminal organization central to the No One Lives Forever series. Contract J.A.C.K. is set between ''No One Lives Forever'' and ''No One Lives Forever 2''. The game does not involve UNITY, the organization for which [[Cate Archer]] works and that opposed H.A.R.M. in the other two games. Rather, ''J.A.C.K.'' pits H.A.R.M. against a rival criminal organization, Danger Danger.

After a night of heavy drinking, Jack is apprehended by thugs, who are ordered to kill him. Before they can, he breaks free from the ropes that tied him to a chair and slaughters the thugs that swarm the building. Before he can leave, he receives a phone call from Dimitrij Volkov, H.A.R.M.'s Director of Executive Action. Volkov tells Jack to report to a job interview at the Roman ruins on [[Malta]]. The interview consists of Jack mowing down waves of H.A.R.M. troopers as Volkov taunts them over a loudspeaker. In the end, Jack is hired by H.A.R.M.

For his first assignment, Jack must infiltrate a Czechoslovakian military base to figure out why Danger Danger is interested in it. Upon delving deeper into the base, Jack becomes aware that the facility is a secret rocket launch site. Danger Danger is trying to use a Czech rocket to recover Dr. Harij, a H.A.R.M. scientist stranded on the moon after the destruction of H.A.R.M.'s space station in ''No One Lives Forever''. Although Danger Danger is able to launch a rocket full of their men, Jack commandeers a second rocket and heads to the moon after them.

On the moon, Jack must fight through Danger Danger goons to get to Dr. Harij. Danger Danger reaches the scientist first, and they begin destroying the lunar base to prevent Jack from escaping. Jack reaches Danger Danger's rocket seconds before it lifts-off. The effects of the rocket's propulsion and the base's explosion send Jack floating through space on a collision course with the Sun. ''Il Pazzo'' ([[Italian language|Italian]] for "The Crazy One"), leader of Danger Danger, begins dispatching men to kill Jack, but he fails, and Jack floats to the other rocket, which had been floating among the debris of the base.

Jack crashes his rocket into the Italian countryside of [[Tuscany]]. ''Il Pazzo'' is nearby with Dr. Harij, and he flees on a gondola. Jack steals a machine gun-equipped [[Vespa]] and pursues them. After killing hordes of ''Il Pazzo's'' men, Jack arrives at a castle where ''Il Pazzo'' is holed up with Dr. Harij. Using cannons positioned around the building, Jack kills the defenders. A long-distance battle ensues between Jack and ''Il Pazzo''. Jack wins, but is not able to kill Il Pazzo completely. After rescuing Dr. Harij, Jack is shot by Volkov and left to die. The game ends with Jack rising up and limping toward Volkov's skis. It is believed that the ending implied why Volkov is confined in a wheel chair and covered in a full-body plaster cast in ''[[No One Lives Forever 2]]''.

== Game engine ==
Contract J.A.C.K. uses the same [[Lithtech]] Jupiter engine as used in the base release of ''[[No One Lives Forever 2: A Spy In H.A.R.M.'s Way]]'' however none of the upgrade paths that are available to boost abilities in the latter are present in J.A.C.K.

'''Dan''' ({{zh|c={{linktext|旦}}|p=dàn|w=tan}}), is the general name for female roles in [[Chinese opera]], often referring to leading roles. They may be played by either actors or actresses. Male actors who specialize in playing ''dàn'' are referred to as [[wikt:男旦|''nándàn'' (男旦)]]; the [[Cross-gender acting|practice]] arose during the [[Qing dynasty]] due to imperial prohibitions against women performing on stage, considered detrimental to public morality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1001055.shtml |title=Peking Opera struggles to preserve tradition of male actors playing female parts |author=Huang Tingting |date=2016-08-17 |website=[[Global Times]] |access-date=2018-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Guanda Wu |year=2013 |title=Should Nandan Be Abolished?

Wei Changsheng, a male {{transl|zh|Dan}} performer in the Qing court, developed the {{transl|zh|''cai qiao''}}, or "false foot" technique, to simulate the bound feet of women and the characteristic gait that resulted from the practice.

==Types==
There are a few different kinds of ''dan'' in Chinese opera. The commonly seen ones are 'Guimen Dan', 'Hua Dan', 'Daoma Dan', 'Wu Dan', 'Lao Dan' and 'Cai Dan'. Each different kind of dan has its own unique characteristics.

===Guimen Dan===
The Guimen Dan ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|闺|门|旦}}}}, "[[boudoir]]-door role") is the role of the virtuous lady. It is also known as Qingyi ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|青|衣}}}}, "verdant-clad"){{refn|group=n|''Qing'' is a color without direct translation into English. It is a single color of which both [[green]] and [[blue]] (and some shades of [[black]]) are considered shades. ''See'' [[Blue-green distinction in language]].}} or Zhengdan ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|正|旦}}}}, "straight role"). Guimen Dan are normally mature and sometimes married women. They may be rich or poor, young or of middle age, but they have to be mature women to fall under this category. Guimen Dan focus more on singing and they have little movement. They sing in a very high pitched and piercing voice. Opera schools in China have difficulty recruiting students for this kind of role, since it requires a good voice, good looks, and a good height. The most famous Guimen Dan of the last century was [[Mei Lanfang]]. Examples of Guimen roles are Du Liniang (杜丽娘) from ''[[The Peony Pavilion]]'' (牡丹亭) and Wang Baochuan (王宝钏）from ''Wujiapo''  (武家坡).

===Hua Dan===
A Hua Dan ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|花|旦}}}}, "flowery role") is a lively, vivacious young [[female]] character. They normally wear short blouses with pants or [[skirts]]. Unlike the Guimen Dan, the Hua Dan focuses more on movements and speech. They must be able to speak quickly and clearly. They also need to project an image of cuteness and innocence as Hua Dan always represent [[girls]] of around 12–16 years old. Often, a Guimen Dan is accompanied by a Hua Dan maid. Hong Niang (红娘) of the ''[[Romance of the Western Chamber]]'' and Yan Xijiao (阎惜姣) of ''Wulongyuan'' (乌龙院) have involved the role of Hua Dan.

===Daoma Dan===
A Daoma Dan ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|刀|马|旦}}}}, "sword-and-horse role"){{refn|group=n|''Dao'' is generically translated "knife" but what is intended here is a [[da dao]]. Chinese distinguishes its bladed weapons by form (single- or double-bladed) rather than by size (knife/sword).}} is a young female warrior. The style of performance usually involves horseriding with a spear. This category is superficially similar to Wu Dan, but there is a difference. Daoma Dan does not fight as much as Wu Dan. They do more stunts and dancing with the spear or whatever weapons they have. Daoma Dan needs to sing, which is performed while dancing or doing stunts and requires great stamina. Daoma Dan usually wears female warrior costumes with the flags behind. Examples of Daoma Dan are [[Liang Hongyu]] and [[Mu Guiying]].  ''Daoma Dan'' is also the original Chinese title of the 1986 Hong Kong film ''[[Peking Opera Blues]]'', directed by [[Tsui Hark]].

===Wu Dan===
The Wu Dan ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|武|旦}}}}, "martial role") specializes in [[fighting]] with all kinds of [[weapons]]. The Wu Dan engages in fighting with opponents besides just doing stunts. In the past, the Wu Dan needed to perform cai qiao (踩跷), which the Daoma Dan did not do. Cai qiao is a very difficult skill requiring the actress to stand on tip toe throughout the whole show. The actress will wear something akin to high heels shoes, but the heels of this special kind of shoe are so high that the actress is practically standing on tip toe. Fake small shoes are then attached underneath so that it appears that the actress has very small feet. It is an imitation of the [[foot binding]] practice. Wu Dan must master many acrobatic movements. They specialize only in fighting hence they seldom sing or speak.  Examples of Wu Dan are Zhizhu Jing (蜘蛛精) of ''Pansidong'' (盘丝洞) and [[Hu Sanniang]].

===Lao Dan===
The Lao Dan ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|老|旦}}}}, "old role") are older women. They have their own set of movements and gestures and singing styles, distinguished against the Guimen Dan. The Guimen roles sing in high pitched and piercing voices while the Lao Dan sing in a lower pitched voice. Lao Dan costumes are also less vibrant compared to other female roles and they have much simpler hair styles.  An example is [[She Saihua|Dowager She]] of ''Yang Men Nu Jiang'' (杨门女将).

===Cai Dan===
The Cai Dan ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|彩|旦}}}}, "colorful role") is a [[clown]]ish woman. Cai Dan do not act like normal Dan and they do clownish gestures. Their movements resemble normal daily movements and they speak in normal voices. Clownish dans are now normally performed by men; hence they are physically unattractive, which is exaggerated by their hideous make up.

===Huashan===
One of Mei Lanfang's most important contributions to Peking opera was in pioneering another type of role, the {{transl|zh|''huashan''}}. This role type combines the status of the {{transl|zh|''qingyi''}} with the sensuality of the {{transl|zh|''huadan''}}.&lt;ref name="Goldstein Mei"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Goldstein, Joshua| title=Mei Lanfang and the Nationalization of Peking Opera, 1912–1930| journal=East Asian Cultures Critique| year=1999| volume=7| issue=2| url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/positions/v007/7.2goldstein.html| pages=377–420 | doi=10.1215/10679847-7-2-377}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2857">[[File:Dimensia remote.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Digital Command Center and the [[Dimensia]] Digital Control]]
The '''Digital Command Center''' was a very large [[remote control]] introduced for RCA's high-end television sets; in 1983 for the  [[Colortrak 2000]] and the SJT400 [[CED player]]&lt;ref&gt;http://cedmagic.com/history/digital-command-center.html&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1984 for the [[Dimensia]] [[Lyceum TV]] sets. The main feature of the Digital Command Center was that it was universal amongst many RCA components, including [[VCR]]s, [[Capacitance Electronic Disc|CED]] players, tuners, [[amplifiers]], [[CD players]], etc., on top of controlling the monitor itself. The Digital Command Center took four [[AA battery|AA]] batteries to power, which is understandable, considering its extensive and ahead-of-its time functionality. 

The initial Digital Command Center released in 1984 with the Dimensia system, the CRK35A, had 52 buttons, had onboard memory, and weighed nearly a pound with its batteries.&lt;ref&gt;http://cedmagic.com/museum/dimensia/crk35a.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1985, RCA released the [[Digital Command Component System]], an all audio system that was compatible with all [[Dimensia]] audio components, which also used the Digital Command Center remote. The idea of this system was to have the full functionality of the Dimensia's sound system without the need of a Dimensia monitor. 

==Dimensia Intelligent Audio Video and Dimensia Digital Control==
{{see also|RCA Dimensia}}

In Dimensia television systems, the remote was called ''Dimensia Intelligent Audio Video'' or ''Dimensia Digital Control'' because all of the components were integrated so that the remote could activate the entire system with the touch of one button by communicating with the built-in computer found in the Dimensia monitor via the black [[RCA Dimensia#Features|control jack]] found on all Dimensia components. This remote had 8 device keys on it; TV, VCR, VID2 (DISC), AUX, AM/FM, PHON, TAPE, and CD. Since the [[CED Player]] intended to be released with the Dimensia system in 1984 was cancelled, the VID2 button and the ability to control the CED Players was absent from later remotes. 

In 1987, the Dimensia Intelligent Audio Video was replaced with a wedge-shaped remote (CRK45A)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cedmagic.com/museum/dimensia/crk35a.html&lt;/ref&gt; shown at the bottom of the picture above.

'''DreamCatcher Interactive Inc.''' (also known as '''DreamCatcher Games''') was a Canadian [[video game publisher]] founded in 1996 by Richard Wah Kan. In 2006, the company became a subsidiary of [[JoWooD Entertainment]]. In 2011, the company [[went into administration]] along with its parent JoWooD and all assets were purchased by [[Nordic Games (company)|Nordic Games Holding]]. The DreamCatcher Interactive brand is currently being used as a publishing label for THQ Nordic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.trademarkia.com/dreamcatcher-interactive-inc-75212375.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2018-02-16 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180217082520/https://www.trademarkia.com/dreamcatcher-interactive-inc-75212375.html |archivedate=2018-02-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
DreamCatcher Interactive was founded in 1996 in [[Toronto|Toronto, Ontario]], Canada. The company’s first title was the [[adventure game]] ''[[Soldier Boyz (video game)|Soldier Boyz]],'' closely followed by ''Jewels of the Oracle'', which achieved enough success to grow the retail business.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.giantbomb.com/jewels-of-the-oracle/61-11227/ Jewels of the Oracle] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110203092714/http://www.giantbomb.com/jewels-of-the-oracle/61-11227/ |date=2011-02-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Dreamcatcher would later release ''[[The Crystal Key]]'' which sold over a half million units in ''[[North America]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20130124021658/http://www.gamespot.com/news/6091612.html The Crystal Key Sales]&lt;/ref&gt; Continuing the company's growth, in November 2000, DreamCatcher signed with [[Her Interactive]] to publish the ''[[Nancy Drew]]'' franchise.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Her+Interactive+Signs+Deal+With+DreamCatcher+to+Publish+and...-a066572698 DreamCatcher Publishes Nancy Drew]&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 2002, most of the assets and development teams of French-based publisher, [[Cryo Interactive]] were absorbed by DreamCatcher Interactive, forming the base for DreamCatcher Europe including key offices and a large internal studio.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mobygames.com/company/cryo-interactive-entertainment Absorbed Cyro Interactive] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100110054348/http://www.mobygames.com/company/cryo-interactive-entertainment |date=2010-01-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; By early 2003, DreamCatcher was the United States' tenth-biggest publisher of games.&lt;ref name=sales&gt;{{cite web | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051023082955/http://www.adventuregamers.com/article/id,223 | url=http://www.adventuregamers.com:80/article/id,223 | title=The Adventure Company Europe | author=Bronstring, Marek | date=March 7, 2003 | archivedate=October 23, 2005 | work=[[Adventure Gamers]] | deadurl=yes | access-date=February 4, 2012 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; After the acquisition of Cryo Interactive, Dreamcatcher created a publishing division called [[The Adventure Company]] in early 2003.  The company also partnered with both [[Wanadoo Edition#Wanadoo Edition|Wanadoo Edition]] and [[Microïds]], as well as other studios in the development and distribution of games including ''[[Syberia]]'', ''[[Still Life (video game)|Still Life]]'' and ''[[ObsCure (video game)|ObsCure]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gamershell.com/companies/dreamcatcher_interactive/208483.html Dreamcatcher Publishes ObsCure] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110615142947/http://www.gamershell.com/companies/dreamcatcher_interactive/208483.html |date=2011-06-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2005, the main Microïds studio was acquired by [[Ubisoft]] with Dreamcatcher retaining publishing rights to the games being created.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/pc/adventure/stilllife/news.html?sid=6119575&amp;om_act=convert&amp;om_clk=newsfeatures&amp;tag=newsfeatures%3Btitle%3B2|title=Ubisoft subsumes Microids Canada|first=Tor|last=Thorsen|publisher=GameSpot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Adventure Company brand label under DreamCatcher has released many adventure game series' including series' based on [[Agatha Christie]] novels.  They also recently signed to release a series of titles based on ''[[The Hardy Boys]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gamespot.com/news/6190931.html The Hardy Boys License] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100901173542/http://www.gamespot.com/news/6190931.html |date=September 1, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Outside of adventure gaming, DreamCatcher is best known for publishing the [[first-person shooter]] ''[[Painkiller (game)|Painkiller]]'' developed with [[People Can Fly]]. Painkiller became a commercial success and was signed with the [[Cyberathlete Professional League|CPL World Tour 2005]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dreamcatchergames.com/dci/press/releases/pdf/painkiller_cpl_tournament.pdf Painkiller Added to Summer CPL Championship] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080719164057/http://www.dreamcatchergames.com/dci/press/releases/pdf/painkiller_cpl_tournament.pdf |date=July 19, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dreamcatcher would also create another label, Silverline Software, around 2004 for the distribution of some non-core games and the publishing of utility software.  Silverline Software would release the "Time to Ride" series of girl’s horse games starting in 2004, which would later be acquired by Ubisoft.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

In 2006, [[JoWooD Entertainment]] announced the purchase of DreamCatcher Games as a way of increasing their presence into the North American gaming market in addition to acquiring the company's key titles and licenses.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ots.euroadhoc.com/irmeldung.php?schluessel=OTA_20061103_OTA0003&amp;ag=OTA Euro Adhoc JoWooD Acquisitions] {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/610R4xWJW?url=http://ots.euroadhoc.com/irmeldung.php?schluessel=OTA_20061103_OTA0003&amp;ag=OTA |date=2011-08-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since the acquisition, DreamCatcher Games has continued to launch titles both under The Adventure Company and DreamCatcher labels including new games created by JoWooD like the [[SpellForce]] series. In 2011, JoWooD went into administration causing DreamCatcher to file for bankruptcy. In November 2011, [[Nordic Games (company)|Nordic Games Holding]] announced that they had acquired all DreamCatcher assets and would be turning it into a publishing label of their subsidiary Nordic Games.&lt;ref name="NORDICACQUISITION"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nordicgames.at/index.php/article/nordic_games_holding_ab_group_acquires_dreamcatcher |title=Nordic Games Holding AB Group acquires DreamCatcher |publisher=Nordic Games |date=2011-11-17 |accessdate=2011-12-11 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/63qOkRoPh?url=http://www.nordicgames.at/index.php/article/nordic_games_holding_ab_group_acquires_dreamcatcher |archivedate=2011-12-11 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nordic Games Holding had previously acquired JoWooD and The Adventure Company in August also turning both brands into publishing labels of Nordic Games.&lt;ref name="NORDICGAMESACQUIRES"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nordicgames.se/index.php?/article/nordic_games_holding_ab_group_acquires_jowood_the_adventure_company |title=Nordic Games Holding AB Group Acquires JoWood &amp; The Adventure Company |publisher=Nordic Games |date=2011-08-16 |accessdate=2011-08-17 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118023226/http://www.nordicgames.se/index.php?%2Farticle%2Fnordic_games_holding_ab_group_acquires_jowood_the_adventure_company |archivedate=2012-01-18 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; All business operations of this brand are being conducted out of THQ Nordic AB in [[Vienna]], Austria.&lt;ref name="NORDICACQUISITION"/&gt;

'''Count Ferdinánd [[Pálffy de Erdőd]]''' (1 February 1774 – 4 February 1840) was a mining engineer and civil servant of the [[Austrian Empire]] who is better remembered for his role in managing the [[Theater an der Wien]], Vienna, in pursuit of which he lost his not inconsiderable fortune and retired from his creditors in [[Vienna]].&lt;ref&gt;H. P. Clive, ''Schubert and His World'' (Oxford University Press) 1997, ''s.v.'' "Pálffy von Erdöd, Ferdinand" supplies most of the information in this article.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Born in the [[Habsburg Monarchy|Habsburg]] residence Vienna the son of Count Lipót Pálffy de Erdőd (1739–1799), he was a distant relative of the Imperial field marshal and [[Kingdom of Hungary (1538–1867)|Hungarian]] palatine [[János Pálffy]] (1664–1751). He attended the mining institute at [[Banská Štiavnica|Schemnitz]], Hungary (now Banská Štiavnica, [[Slovakia]]) from 1794 to 1796, where he remained in government service before returning to Vienna in 1806 to work in the [[Austrian Empire|Austrian]] ministry of mines. 
[[File:TheateranDerWienJakobAlt.jpg|thumb|left|[[Jakob Alt]]: ''Theater an der Wien'', 1815]]
In 1807 Pálffy was among the association of court nobles that acquired the [[Theater an der Wien]], as well as the leases of the other two theatres patronised by the court, the [[Burgtheater]] and the [[Theater am Kärntnertor]]. By degrees he became solely responsible for the court theaters, and in 1813 he acquired outright the Theater an der Wien, inducing [[Louis Spohr]] to come from his court appointment in [[Gotha]] to conduct its orchestra.

Count Pálffy was a dedicated patroniser of [[Ludwig van Beethoven]], whom he reserved an honored place in his theatre—in close vicinity to the orchestra due to Beethoven's incipient deafness. According to Spohr, he nevertheless was vociferously accursed by the impetuous composer. Under Pálffy's directorship, the Theater an der Wien saw the premiere of [[Helmina von Chézy]]'s ''Rosamunda'', which sank without a trace, save for its incidental music by [[Franz Schubert]], whose 1820 melodrama ''[[Die Zauberharfe]]'' found eight performances at the Theater, for which Schubert dedicated to Palffy his Grande Sonata in B-flat major ([[List of Schubert compositions by D number|D]] 617).&lt;ref&gt;Clive 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; He found fault with Spohr's 1813 opera ''[[Faust (Spohr)|Faust]]'', so that [[Carl Maria von Weber]] arranged its premiere at the Prague [[Estates Theatre]] in 1816.

During the period of his proprietorship, which lasted until 1826, he offered [[opera]] and [[ballet]] and, to appeal to a wider Viennese audience, popular [[pantomime]] and variety acts, losing money in elaborate spectacles until he was forced to sell the theater at auction in 1826, and to disperse his library and collection of mineral specimens. Fearing arrest for his outstanding debts, he fled Vienna for [[Bratislava|Preßburg]] (Bratislava) where he remained for several years.

'''Graphic violence''' is the depiction of especially vivid, brutal and realistic acts of [[violence in the media|violence]] in visual media such as [[literature]], [[film]], [[television]], and [[video game]]s. It may be real, simulated [[live action]], or [[animated]].

The "graphic" in graphic violence is a synonym for "explicit", referring to the clear and unabashed nature of the violence portrayed; this is what differentiates true graphic violence from lesser forms of violence in media productions, including "real" violence, "cartoon" violence and "fantasy" violence.

==Media==
Graphic violence generally consists of any clear and uncensored depiction of various violent acts. Commonly included depictions include murder, assault with a deadly weapon, accidents which result in death or severe injury, suicide, and torture. In all cases, it is the explicitness of the violence and the injury inflicted which results in it being labeled "graphic". In fictional depictions, appropriately realistic plot elements are usually included to heighten the sense of realism (i.e. [[Blood squirt|blood effects]], [[Troy weapon|prop weapon]]s, [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]]). In order to qualify for the "graphic" designation, the violence depicted must generally be of a particularly unmitigated and unshielded nature; an example would be a video of a man being shot by me, bleeding from the wound, and crumpling to the ground calling for his mother.

Graphic violence arouses strong emotions, ranging from titillation and excitement to utter revulsion and even terror, depending on the mindset of the viewer and the method in which it is presented. A certain degree of graphic violence has become ''de rigueur'' in adult "action" genre, and it is presented in an amount and manner carefully deliberated to excite the emotions of the target demographic without inducing disgust or revulsion. Even more extreme and grotesque acts of graphic violence (generally revolving around mutilation) are often used in the horror genre in order to inspire even stronger emotions of fear and shock (which the viewing demographic would presumably be seeking).

It is a highly controversial topic. Many believe that exposure to graphic violence leads to [[desensitization (psychology)|desensitization]] to committing acts of violence in person. It has led to [[censorship]] in extreme cases, and regulation in others. One notable case was the creation of the US [[Entertainment Software Rating Board]] in 1994. Many nations now require varying degrees of approval from television, movie, and software rating boards before a work can be released to the public.

On the other hand, some critics claim that watching violent media content can be cathartic, providings "acceptable outlets for anti-social impulses."&lt;ref name="bruder"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.gradnet.de/papers/pomo2.archives/pomo98.papers/mtbruder98.htm |title= Aestheticizing Violence, or How To Do Things with Style |accessdate=2007-06-08 |last= Bruder |first= Margaret Ervin |year= 1998 |publisher= Film Studies, Indiana University, Bloomington IN |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20040908094032/http://www.gradnet.de/papers/pomo2.archives/pomo98.papers/mtbruder98.htm |archivedate= 2004-09-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Film===
Graphic violence is used frequently in [[horror film|horror]], [[action film|action]], and [[crime film]]s. Several of these films were banned from certain countries for their violence. The [[snuff film]] takes horror to its furthest extreme as [[torture]] and murder are not simulated.

Violence in films is not an old topic, recently a study presented in an annual American Academy of Pediatrics conference showed that the "good guys" in superhero movies were on average more violent than the villains, potentially sending a strongly negative message to young viewers.[https://www.thenewstribe.com/2018/11/03/good-guys-more-violent-than-bad-ones-in-superhero-films-study/] 

==News media==
[[News media]] on television and online video frequently cover violent acts. The coverage may be preceded with a warning, stating that the footage may be disturbing to some viewers.

Sometimes graphic images are censored, by blurring or blocking a portion of the image, cutting the violent portions out of an image sequence or by removing certain portions of film footage from viewing. However, more and more throughout the years, it has been a ploy for media companies to attract more and more viewers by trivializing various events like the ones mentioned above for shock appeal.

==Music videos==
Graphic and gory violence has started appearing in [[music video]]s in recent times, an example being the controversial music video for the song "[[Rock DJ]]" by British rock vocalist [[Robbie Williams]], which features self-mutilation. Another example of a music video containing strong violence is the music video for the song "[[Hurricane (Thirty Seconds to Mars song)|Hurricane]]" by American rock band [[Thirty Seconds to Mars]] and "[[Happiness in Slavery]]" by American industrial rock group [[Nine Inch Nails]]. The music video for "[[Monolith of Inhumanity|Forced Gender Reassignment]]" by American [[deathgrind]] band [[Cattle Decapitation]] displays such intense graphic violence that it is not hosted by many popular video hosting sites like [[YouTube]] and [[Dailymotion]] and is only hosted by [[Bloody Disgusting]].

==Video games==
Violent content has been a central part of [[video game controversy]]. Because violence in video games is interactive and not passive, critics such as [[Dave Grossman (author)|Dave Grossman]] and [[Jack Thompson (attorney)|Jack Thompson]] argue that violence in games hardens children to unethical acts, calling [[first-person shooter]] games "murder simulators", although no conclusive evidence has supported this belief.

An example is the display of "[[Gib (video gaming)|gibs]]" (short for giblets&lt;ref&gt;Mahood, Andy, [http://uk.pc.gamespy.com/pc/half-life-2/682881p1.html Modify - Issue 12: Half-Life 2 on Steroids (PC)] ''GameSpy'', Jan. 26, 2006, Retrieved on Feb 27 2008&lt;/ref&gt;), little bits or giant chunks of [[internal organ]]s, [[flesh]], and [[bone]], when a character is killed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://uk.pc.ign.com/mail/1999-07-28.html Reply to Letter to the Editor], ''IGN'', Jul 28, 1999, Retrieved Feb 27 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==Internet==
On the internet, several sites dedicated to recordings of real graphic violence, referred to as "gore", exist, such as [[Bestgore.com]] and [[Goregrish.com]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://globalnews.ca/news/1617578/luka-magnottas-gore-video-why-is-the-court-seeing-it/ |title=Luka Magnotta’s gore video: Why is the court seeing it? |last1=Minsky |first1=Amy|date=16 October 2014 |website= |publisher= |access-date=28 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/luka-magnotta-trial-jury-watches-infamous-video-1.2800822 |title=Luka Magnotta trial: Jury watches 'infamous' video |last1=Shivji|first1=Salimah |date=16 October 2014 |website= |publisher= |access-date=28 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, many content-aggregator sites such as [[Reddit]] or [[imageboard]]s and [[4chan]] have their own subsites which are dedicated to or allow that kind of content. Some of those sites also require that gore material to be marked as it, often by the [[internet slang]] "[[Not safe for life|NSFL]]" ([[shorthand]] for "not safe for life"). This kind of media might depict reality footage of war, car crashes and other accidents, decapitations, suicide, terrorism, murder, or executions. &lt;!-- [[LiveLeak]] --&gt;

'''Joseph Darby''' (1861&amp;ndash;1937) was a renowned jumper from the [[Black Country]] village of [[Netherton, West Midlands|Netherton]]. He specialised in spring jumping (jumping starting from a stationary position) often using weights in his hands to help propel him. After taking part in competitive jumping at venues in the [[The Midlands|Midlands]] and North of England in the 1880s, he went on to perform at theatres in London and Paris and crossed the Atlantic to exhibit in North America.  He entertained crowds by performing trick jumps and earned money in wagers with competitors. Highlights in his career included defeating the American World Champion spring-jumper in 1887 and appearing before the future King Edward VII in Covent Garden, London. After finishing his jumping career, he became a publican in the English town of [[Dudley]].

==Early life==
[[File:Windmill End, Netherton - geograph.org.uk - 1474388.jpg|thumb|left|Windmill End, pictured in 2011]]
Joseph Darby was born in Windmill End, Netherton on August 6, 1861. His parents were Abraham Darby, a maker of nails for shoeing horses, and Martha Darby (née Foley).&lt;ref name="BCB Joe Darby Birth"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Workman|first1=John|title=Dudley's Joe Darby's birth certificate comes to light|url=http://www.blackcountrybugle.co.uk/the-birth-certificate-of-a-black-country-legend-comes-to-light/story-29658374-detail/story.html|accessdate=7 September 2016|work=Black Country Bugle|publisher=Local World|date=31 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When interviewed in 1889 he said that he had only received ten months' schooling at the most "and only half-time at that."  He also said that he started work at the age of seven, making nails.&lt;ref name="Brisbane Telegraph"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/185524087?searchTerm=joseph%20darby%20jump&amp;searchLimits=|title=Jumping Joseph|last=|first=|date=2 February 1889|work=The Telegraph (Brisbane, Queensland)|access-date=15 July 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; When asked when he started jumping he replied "I was always at it when a bit of a kiddy, jumping against the other lads, and I could always beat them fair and easy."&lt;ref name="Brisbane Telegraph"/&gt;

According to an interview he gave whilst on a tour in the U.S., he commenced his working life making nails for horseshoes, before working in a colliery and subsequently unloading boats.&lt;ref name="Pittsburgh Press"&gt;{{cite news|title=Joe Darby. The Marvel|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1144&amp;dat=18931118&amp;id=yg4bAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=c0gEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7100,747257&amp;safe=vss&amp;hl=en|accessdate=19 May 2016|work=The Pittsburgh Press|date=18 November 1893}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early sporting career==
At the age of 18 he took up athletics, firstly as a professional runner over distances of 100 and 120 yards.&lt;ref name="Interview Cricket and Football"&gt;{{cite news |title=Joe Darby, The Jumper |url=https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/BL/0000979/18891102/069/0008 |accessdate=4 October 2018 |work=Cricket and Football Field |via=The British Newspaper Archive |date=2 November 1889|page=8|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; He reportedly had success as a runner, competing 22 times and only suffering one defeat.&lt;ref name="Interview Cricket and Football"/&gt; He took up competitive jumping when aged 20 or 21.&lt;ref name="Brisbane Telegraph"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pittsburgh Press" /&gt; He specialised in [[Standing long jump|spring-jumping]] where he launched himself from a standing position. He often used [[Dumbbell|dumbbell-shaped weights]] in his hands to help propel himself for the spring jumps. 

In a promotional pamphlet produced by Darby or his agent, the first competitive jump listed is a defeat of T. Hartshorn of Netherton for a £20 wager.&lt;ref name="Bugle feats"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Jasper|first1=Josephine|title=Joe Darby - Netherton's Legendary Leaper|url=http://www.blackcountrybugle.co.uk/Joe-Darby-Nethertons-Legendary-Leaper/story-20155479-detail/story.html|accessdate=8 June 2016|work=Black Country Bugle|publisher=Local World|date=29 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This competition took place at the Lea Brook Grounds, Wednesbury on 8 January 1883.&lt;ref name="Sporting Life 10 Jna 1883"&gt;{{cite news |title=BIRMINGHAM AND DISTRICT.

Darby's next jumping competition took place on 14 May 1883, at the same sporting grounds as for his first competition, and was against W. Hughes of [[Kates Hill]], Dudley. Darby again proved the winner in a contest where he took 15 "rising jumps" against his opponents 15 "rising hops".&lt;ref name="Sporting Life 16 May 1883"&gt;{{cite news |title=BIRMINGHAM AND DISTRICT.

Darby's third contest was against Kirk of Ilkstone, Derbyshire, again at the Lea Brook Grounds on 24 September 1883.&lt;ref name="Sporting Life 26 September 1883"&gt;{{cite news |title=BIRMINGHAM AND DISTRICT.  LEA BROOK GROUNDS, WEDNESBURY |url=https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/BL/0000893/18830926/071/0004?browse=False |accessdate=10 November 2018 |work=Sporting Life |via=The Briish Newspaper Archive |date=26 September 1883|page=4|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Early competitions"/&gt; In his third victory, this time for £40 stakes, Darby jumped 35ft. 8in. in a sequence of three spring jumps. 

Darby now took a break from competition, working as a collier and unloader of canal boats, &lt;ref name="Interview Cricket and Football"/&gt; only returning to jumping in November 1885 when he defeated W. Fillingham of Wigan, Lancashire for £100 at the Queen's Ground, [[Barnsley]].&lt;ref name="Sporting Life 4 July 1887"&gt;{{cite news |title=JUMPING.  J. DARBY AND T. BURROWS. FOR £200.

On 7 December 1885, Darby lost a match to Tom Pollitt of Openshaw at the Moorfield Grounds near Manchester. For the contest, involving two forward spring jumps, Pollitt jumped first and was given a 12in start. Darby was unable to reach his opponent's mark after three jumps and so Pollitt won the £20 stake money.&lt;ref name="Sporting Life 8 Dec 1885"&gt;{{cite news |title=Moorfield Grounds, Failsworth |url=https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000893/18851208/080/0004 |accessdate=14 November 2018 |work=Sporting Life |via=The British Newspaper Archive |date=8 December 1885|page=4|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 27 February 1886, Darby took on and beat John Holland of Middleton, the contest taking place at the Moorfield Grounds, Failsworth, near Manchester. For the contest, Darby took 7 forward stand jumps against Holland's "five run hops and a jump". At this time, Darby was being trained by T. Walker of the Windmill Inn. Darby won the contest by 12 inches.&lt;ref name="Sporting Life 1 March 1886"&gt;{{cite news |title=MOORFIELD GROUNDS, FAILSWORTH, NEAR  MANCHESTER |url=https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000893/18860301/040/0001 |accessdate=14 November 2018 |work=Sporting Life |via=The British Newspaer Archive |date=1 March 1886|page=1|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequent victories for Darby were recorded&lt;ref name="Lea Brook Ground"/&gt;.  On 26 April 1886, he avenged his previous defeat by Tom Pollitt. The event took place at the Moorfield Grounds, Failworth near Manchester for total stakes of £100. The competition involved 4 standing jumps, with Pollitt being given a yard start.&lt;ref name="Sporting Life 24 April 1886"&gt;{{cite news |title=MOORFIELD GROUNDS, FAILSWORTH, NEAR |url=https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000893/18860424/080/0003 |accessdate=18 November 2018 |work=Sporting Life |via=The British Newspaper Archive |date=24 April 1886|page=3|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 19 March 1887, he defeated William Brown of Leeds, Yorkshire, for £50, the jumping completion taking place at the Cardigan Grounds, Leeds.&lt;ref name="Yorkshire Post 19 March 1887"&gt;{{cite news |title=Cardigan Grounds |url=https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000687/18870319/185/0010 |accessdate=18 November 2018 |work=Yorkshire Post and Leeds Intelligencer |via=The British Newspaper Archive |date=19 March 1887|page=10|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The competition involved Darby taking ten forward spring jumps against Brown's nine hops and a jump, Darby's winning margin being 3in despite Brown being given a 1 yard start.&lt;ref name="Sporting Life 24 March 1887"&gt;{{cite news |title=Leeds and Neighbourhood |url=https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000893/18870324/059/0004 |accessdate=18 November 2018 |work=Sporting Life |agency=The British Newspaper Archive |date=24 March 1887|page=4|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 30 April 1887, he defeated Bill Brown of Bradford for £50 at the Victoria Grounds, Wolverhampton, the event involving two backward jumps.&lt;ref name="Sporting Life 4 May 1887"&gt;{{cite news |title=Wolverhampton and District |url=https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000893/18870504/056/0003 |accessdate=18 November 2018 |work=Sporting Life |via=The British Newspaper Archive |date=4 May 1887|page=3|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

On 2 July 1887 he defeated Thomas Burrows, of Nelson, Lancashire, for £50 a-side.&lt;ref name="Sporting Life 4 July 1887"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Early competitions"&gt;{{cite news |title=Special Engagement of Joseph Darby |work=Sporting Life |page=1 |date=5 November 1888}}&lt;/ref&gt; The competition took place at the Moorfield Grounds, Failsworth and involved Darby taking seven standing forward spring jumps against Burrows' six run hops and a jump. Darby won the contest by 3ft 5¾in.

On 29 October 1887, Darby was beaten by Daniel Dearden of Haydock, at the Swan Inn Grounds, St. Helens. For the competition, involving three jumps, Dearden had the advantage of using weights whilst Darby jumped without. However, Darby was given a two feet start.&lt;ref name="Dearden competition"&gt;{{cite news |title=Lancashire Grounds |url=https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0001055/18871031/037/0003 |accessdate=29 August 2018 |work=The Sportsman |agency=British Newspaper Archive |date=31 October 1887|page=3|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 1889, Darby was being billed as the "Champion Jumper of the Word", the "Ninth Wonder of the World" and as the "Flying Man".&lt;ref name="The Era 28 December 1889"&gt;{{cite news |title=JOSEPH DARBY |url=https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000053/18891228/085/0022 |accessdate=21 November 2018 |work=The Era |via=The British Newspaper Archive |date=28 December 1889|page=22|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1890 it was reported that: "Darby goes through no exceptional training unless for a special contest.

In February 1892, Darby was performing at Rowland's Circus, Wolverhampton, where his act included jumping 36 feet in three jumps ending with a jump over a chair placed on a table; jumping over a tank of water, lowering his feet to touch the surface of the water as he passed over the tank and springing over eight chairs placed back to back.&lt;ref name="Rowland's Circus"&gt;{{cite news |title=Wolverhampton |work=The Stage |issue=568 |page=15|date=4 February 1892}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was at this venue where Darby performed one of his most famous trick jumps: that of clearing a full sized billiard table (minus cushions). In fact, an authentic billiard table was not available at the occasion, so a dummy table was erected. Darby was hampered in his attempt by lack of space and could only take two stand spring jumps prior to leaping the table, which he succeeded in doing on his fifth attempt.&lt;ref name="Billiard table jump"&gt;{{cite news |title=Marvellous Jumping Performances |url=https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000893/18920210/161/0008 |accessdate=17 August 2018 |work=Sporting Life |publisher=British Newspaper Archive |page=8|date=10 February 1892|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 1892 he performed as part of a variety show at the [[Empire, Leicester Square|Empire Theatre]], London alongside the celebrated musical-hall performer, [[Marie Lloyd]].&lt;ref name="The Times 1892"&gt;{{cite news|title=Empire Theatre Tonight|date=28 October 1892|work=The Times|publisher=The Times|issue=33781}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[George Bernard Shaw]] attended one of the performances and wrote: "Now is it not odd that at a music-hall to which, perhaps, half the audience have come to hear Marie Lloyd sing Twiggy voo, boys, twiggy voo? or to see Mr Darby jump a ten-barred gate, you get real stage art".&lt;ref name="GBS"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shaw|first1=George Bernard|title=Music in London 1890-94 Volume 2|date=1932|publisher=Constable and Company|location=London|page=168}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to an American newspaper: "English athletes are just now flocking to the Empire theater, London, to witness the high and broad jumping feats of Joseph Darby, the champion jumper and holder of the championship belt." The same source reported: "one of his favorite tricks is to place six chairs in a row and spring from a brick at one end of the line to a corresponding brick at the other. His flying feats include a leap over a chair placed on a table and over eight chairs in a row, a length of eighteen feet. He goes over a horse seventeen hands high with his ankles tied. Among his phenomenal performances are a backward spring over three
chairs and a leap over a tank of water ten feet long, during which he lightly skims the water with his foot. His most unique feat is a jump over a chair, alighting on a man's face and jumping
back again without injuring his assistant. As the latter is generally a choice specimen of the London tough the escape of his cheek is not to be wondered at. Darby concludes his sensational performance with a leap over a six-foot hurdle lined at the top with a bristling row of spikes."&lt;ref name="Empire show"&gt;{{cite news |title=An English jumper who surpasses all records |url=https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn90059522/1892-10-30/ed-1/seq-13/#date1=1887&amp;index=4&amp;rows=20&amp;words=Darby+Joseph+jumping&amp;searchType=basic&amp;sequence=0&amp;state=&amp;date2=1900&amp;proxtext=joseph+darby+jump&amp;y=12&amp;x=20&amp;dateFilterType=yearRange&amp;page=1 |accessdate=20 July 2018 |work=St. Paul daily globe |date=30 October 1892}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1893, an Australian newspaper acclaimed Darby with the words: "no athlete can boast of such a brilliant record of achievements in his own particular department as Mr Darby, who for

On 22 July 1893, Darby took on another remarkable jumper of the age, John (Jack) Higgins of [[Blackburn]]. The competition was held at the Moorfield Ground, [[Failsworth]] and involved both athletes performing a "hop, two strides and a jump" for a stake of £100.

In April 1894, whilst performing at Ohmy's Grand Circus, Longton, Darby issued a challenge for all comers to compete for between £500 and £1000 a-side with a choice of between 1 and 20 jumps. Darby offered competitors a 5&amp;nbsp;ft start over 10 jumps and 10&amp;nbsp;ft start over 20 jumps.&lt;ref name="Darby's challenge"&gt;{{cite news |title=Joe Darby |work=The Era |volume=56 |issue=2899  |page=26| date=14 April 1894}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Second championship belt and sporting retirement===
Darby announced his retirement from competitive jumping (although not from exhibitions) on 23 July 1894 after winning a competition held at [[Dudley Castle|Dudley Castle Grounds]].&lt;ref name="Sortsman"&gt;{{cite news|title=THE JUMPING CHAMPION SHIP|url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/227718933?searchTerm=joe%20darby%20jump&amp;searchLimits=|accessdate=15 July 2016|work=Sportsman (Melbourne, Victoria)|date=4 September 1894}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Sporting Chronicle|Manchester Sporting Chronicle]] awarded Darby a Championship belt as a result of winning this contest.&lt;ref name="Hull Dail Mail"&gt;{{cite news |title=Champion Jumper of the World |work=Hull Daily Mail |issue=3003|page=3|date=2 May 1895}}&lt;/ref&gt; The belt was presented at the conclusion of the two day sports fête by the [[William Ward, 2nd Earl of Dudley|Earl of Dudley]].&lt;ref name="Dudley fetes 1894"&gt;{{cite news |title=FETES AT THE PRIORY, DUDLEY |url=https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0002179/18940728/050/0006 |accessdate=26 August 2018 |work=County Advertiser &amp; Herald for Staffordshire and Worcestershire |via=British Newspaper Archive |date=28 July 1894|page=6|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Further performances===
In March 1895, he interrupted a tour of France to appear at the Empire Theatre, Coventry, the stage having been specially strengthened for his act.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Coventry's Forgotten Theatre|last=Bottle|first=Ted|publisher=The Badger Press|year=2004|isbn=0952607670|location=Westbury, UK|pages=164}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a newspaper interview given in May 1895, Darby stated that he had performed in "France, Germany, Holland, in fact nearly all over the Continent".&lt;ref name="Hull Dail Mail"/&gt; He also stated that he had performed in front of royalty in many nations, including the Prince of Wales. According to an obituary article, written much later, a special command performance had been arranged before the Prince of Wales by [[Lord Henry Arthur George Somerset|Lord Arthur Somerset]] at Evans' Rooms, Covent Garden.&lt;ref name="Birmingham Daily Gazette"&gt;{{cite news |title=Dudley Jumper who Astonished World Dead |work=Birmingham Daily Gazette |issue=29228 |page=5|date=23 December 1937}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 1895, Darby gave performances at Tudor's Circus in Cambridge.&lt;ref name="Cambidge 1895"&gt;{{cite news |title=The Town and County |url=https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000421/18950816/154/0008 |accessdate=2 September 2018 |work=Cambridge Chronicle and Journal |via=British Newspaper Archive |date=16 August 1895|page=8|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 1897, Darby had a benefit performance at Walsall, taking on local jumper Arthur Boyce.&lt;ref name="Benefit"&gt;{{cite news|title=On the occasion of Joe Darby's benefit|url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/227744362?searchTerm=jumping%20match%20darby&amp;searchLimits=|accessdate=20 September 2016|work=Sportsman (Melbourne, Victoria)|date=4 January 1898}}&lt;/ref&gt; For this match, it was decided that Boyce would jump in a forward direction without weights against Darby jumping backwards with weights. Before the match started, Darby entertained the crowds by leaping over a horse-drawn carriage. A newspaper reported on the event : "on Darby entering the arena he met with a magnificent reception. A covered [[Brougham (carriage)|brougham]] was brought from the nearest cab stand, and at the second attempt, amid deafening cheers, Darby was over like a bird."&lt;ref name="Benefit"/&gt; Darby went on to win the match.

In 1898, he featured in a short film made by  Riley Brothers entitled 'Joe Darby in his Various Jumps'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=British Film Catalogue: Two Volume Set - The Fiction Film/The Non-Fiction Film|last=Gifford|first=Dennis|publisher=Routledge|year=2001|isbn=978-1579581718|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film showed Darby "leaping the horse - Jumping over a man and just touching his face - Jumping over water and just skimming the surface - Jumping over a large number of chairs placed near together - &amp;c. &amp;c."&lt;ref name="Pioneers of British Film"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barnes|first1=John|title=Pioneers of the British film|date=1983|publisher=Bishopsgate|isbn=9781852190125|page=189}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 30 August 1898, Darby suffered an injury whilst attempting to jump over a brougham at Scarborough, catching the top of the carriage as he passed over and falling forward onto his head.&lt;ref name="Injury at Scarborough"&gt;{{cite news |title=ACCIDENT TO DARBY, THE JUMPER |url=https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0001005/18980903/157/0012 |accessdate=29 August 2018 |work=Dudley Herald |via=British Newspaper Archive |date=3 September 1898|page=12|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Brief return to competitive jumping and final performances===
On 12 November 1898, Darby briefly returned to competitive jumping when he took on Thomas Colquitt of St Helens at the Wellington Grounds, [[Bury, Greater Manchester|Bury]], in front of 2000 spectators. The competition involved a sequence of 10 forward spring jumps without weights. Colquitt won the event and the £100 stake.&lt;ref name="Colquitt"&gt;{{cite news|title=Jumping Match for £100|url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/121527451|accessdate=2 August 2016|work=Referee (Sydney, New South Wales)|date=28 December 1898}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the plinth of his statue in Netherton, it is recorded that on 19 November 1898 he was summoned for a 'Royal Command Performance' at Covent Garden where he  performed in front of the Prince of Wales, the future [[Edward VII|King Edward VII]].

In March 1899, Darby was again performing at the Cirque d'Hiver in Paris, where his performance included leaping over a horse-drawn carriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.theeuropeanlibrary.org/tel4/newspapers/issue/3000114888537?hp=4&amp;count=10&amp;page=4&amp;query=joe%2Bdarby&amp;decade=1890-1899|title=Au Cirque d'Hiver|last=|first=|date=7 March 1899|work=L'écho de Paris|access-date=20 September 2016|via=The European Library}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 1899, Darby was reported as appearing at the "Milford Flower Show and Sports", where his performance included jumping over a cab and over 14 chairs.&lt;ref name="Milford Sports"&gt;{{cite news |title=Milford Flower Show and Sports |work=Belper News |volume=4 |issue=164 |page=7 |date=4 August 1899}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 1900, Darby performed again at the Milford Flower Show, when it was reported that he was unable to do one of his most popular jumps, leaping over a  cab, because the vehicle did not arrive in time. It was also reported that his 9 year old son made his debut at this event.&lt;ref name="Milfor Flower Show 1900"&gt;{{cite news |title=Milford Flower Show |url=https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000327/19000723/019/0002 |accessdate=9 September 2018 |work=Derby Daily Telegraph |via=British Newspaper Archives |date=23 July 1900|page=2|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Milford Flower Show2"&gt;{{cite news |title=Milford Flower Show |url=https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0001536/19000727/089/0008 |accessdate=9 September 2018 |work=Belper News |via=British Newspaper Archive |date=27 July 1900| page=8|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career after jumping==
Despite Darby's fame, he never lived far from his birthplace in Netherton. In 1900 he was listed by a local trade directory with the profession of "Champion Jumper", living at 23 High Street, Netherton.&lt;ref name="Blocksidge 1900"&gt;{{cite book|title=Blocksidge's Illustrated Dudley Almanack|date=1900|publisher=E. Blocksidge|location=Dudley, UK|page=137}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In later life he became the landlord of the Albion Inn, Stone Steet, [[Dudley]]. He advertised on 9 June 1900 that he had taken over this pub&lt;ref name="Albion Hotel"&gt;{{cite news |title=Joseph Darby, Champion Jumper of the World |work=Dudley Herald |issue=1712 |page=7 |date=9 June 1900}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and he was listed as being a "Licensed Victualler" there from 1901 onwards.&lt;ref name="Blocksidge 1901"&gt;{{cite book|title=Blocksidge's Illustrated Dudley Almanack|date=1901|publisher=E. Blocksidge|location=Dudley, UK|page=60}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 1900 it was reported that he had entered a lion's cage set up on Dudley Market Place in order to settle a bet of £10.&lt;ref name="Lion's cage stunt"&gt;{{cite news |title=Notes of the Week |url=https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0001005/19000908/079/0007 |accessdate=26 August 2018 |work=Dudley Herald |via=British Newspaper Archive |date=8 September 1900|page=7|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1934, Darby attended the civic reception given to the Dudley-born Wimbledon tennis champion, [[Dorothy Round]].&lt;ref name="Dorothy Round"&gt;{{cite news |title=Welcome home to Miss Dorothy Round |work=Staffordshire Advertiser |page=2 |date=21 July 1934}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He died in Dudley on the 22nd of December, 1937

==Jumps==

Joseph Darby performed his jumps at a number of venues including sports grounds, circuses and concert halls.&lt;ref name="Athletic feats"&gt;{{cite news|title=A few of the athletic feats achieved by Joe Darby, Achilles of the Black Country|url=http://www.blackcountrybugle.co.uk/athletic-feats-achieved-Joe-DarbybrAchilles-Black-Country/story-20140447-detail/story.html|accessdate=25 November 2015|work=Black Country Bugle|date=5 August 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He received money for performing, often from betting on the outcome of competitions with other jumpers.&lt;ref name="Nethertons Legend"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Jasper|first1=Josephine|title=Joe Darby - Netherton's Legendary Leaper|url=http://www.blackcountrybugle.co.uk/Joe-Darby-Nethertons-Legendary-Leaper/story-20155479-detail/story.html|accessdate=25 November 2015|work=Black Country Bugle|date=29 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The jumps themselves involved forwards and backwards spring jumps (often multiple jumps) and high jumps. In addition to competitive jumping, Darby developed a repertoire of "trick jumps" for entertainment purposes.  Some of these jumps were over obstacles such as chairs at regular spacings.&lt;ref name="Nethertons Legend"/&gt; Others required dexterity such as taking off or landing on a brick. He also developed the ability to briefly touch down his feet before his actual landing, which made possible some of his more famous "trick jumps". For one such trick jump, a volunteer would lie on the ground in the path of the jump and Joseph Darby would appear to land on and jump off the person's face.&lt;ref name="Nethertons Legend"/&gt; Another such trick jump would involve jumping over a tank of water and briefly touching the surface of the water with his shoes.

To achieve jumps of greater distances or heights, Darby would sometimes employ dumb-bell shaped weights held in both hands. These could be used to provide extra momentum. It was reported in 1893 that he was using weights of 9&amp;nbsp;lb each.&lt;ref name="Pittsburgh Press"/&gt; It was also reported that he made his jumps wearing steel-tipped [[Clog (British)|clogs]],&lt;ref name="Training"/&gt; albeit "very thin and beautifully made" ones.&lt;ref name="Pittsburgh Press"/&gt; However it was reported that when jumping in a backwards direction he wore [[Plimsoll shoe|pumps]].&lt;ref name="Pittsburgh Press"/&gt;

Darby's single forward spring-jump of 12&amp;nbsp;ft 2 ½ in, achieved without weights on October 24, 1889,&lt;ref name="Police Gazette"/&gt; stands comparison with the best achieved since then. The world (amateur) record for this event when it was still an Olympic sport in the early 20th century was 3.47m (about 11&amp;nbsp;ft 4 ½ in) achieved on 3 September 1904 by [[Ray Ewry]].&lt;ref name="Ray Ewry"&gt;{{cite web|title=Ray Ewry|url=http://www.usatf.org/halloffame/TF/showBio.asp?HOFIDs=52|website=USA Track &amp; Field|publisher=USA Track and Field|accessdate=2 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of his most famous achievements include: jumping over a full sized billiard table, a six-foot high jump performed with ankles tied,  and leaping over a horse 13 hands high.&lt;ref name="Athletic feats"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Nethertons Legend"/&gt;

===Trick Jumps===

The Pittsburgh Press in November 1893 listed the following jumps in Darby's repertoire:&lt;ref name="Pittsburgh Press"/&gt;

Jumps over twenty chairs placed ten feet apart.

Jumps over six chairs in one jump.

Clears two chairs 18&amp;nbsp;ft apart.

Jumps off one brick, end up, over a chair, lands on another brick end up, and backwards without knocking the bricks down.

Jumps on to a man's face while lying down and off again without hurting the man.

Jumps 36&amp;nbsp;ft in three successive jumps and in the third jump lands on a man's back, whilst he is lying across the edge of two chairs, and off again without hurting him.

Jumps off one brick, end up, over a horse 15 hands high.

Darby's leap over a full sized billiard table lengthwise in Wolverhampton was mentioned in several editions of the [[Guinness World Records|Guinness Book of World Records]].&lt;ref name="GBR 1974"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Biggar|first1=Suzi|title=Guinness Book of Records|date=1974|publisher=Guinness Superlatives|isbn=0900424222|page=224}}&lt;/ref&gt; For this jump he took a running start and leapt from a 4 in wooden block, clearing the 12&amp;nbsp;ft long, 2&amp;nbsp;ft 10 in high table in one bound. This was achieved on 5 February 1892.

In 1893, a Canadian newspaper reported that: "he has thirty-nine feats in his performance or act, the most sensational of which is his great water jump, representing a jump from England to America. In accomplishing this feat he will alight on the water and off again without wetting the upper leather of his boots. This marvellous feat has never been accomplished by any artist in this world." &lt;ref name="Montreal"/&gt; More detail of this jump was given in an Australian publication: "a tank is set in the middle of the stage, and is filled to the brim with water. Mr Darby takes a flying leap, and as he passes over the water be descends slightly. By this downward motion he, as it were, alights on the top of the water, and flies off again without wetting the upper leather of his boots." When asked how he
managed this feat, he replied: "I really don't know, it comes naturally to
me, though when I think of it myself it seems almost an impossibility."&lt;ref name="Telegraph Tasmania"/&gt;

==The'Spring-heeled Jack' Legend==

Joseph Darby has been linked to the [[Spring-heeled Jack]] legend. In Victorian times, the legendary character known as 'Spring-heeled Jack' was reportedly spotted at a number of locations in Britain, including the Black Country. The creature was often described as having blazing eyes and had the ability to leap great distances. Joseph Darby supposedly started a local 'Spring-heeled Jack' scare when he was spotted practising his jumping by leaping over a local canal at night time, using a miner's lighted helmet to see his way.&lt;ref name="Spring heeled jack"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Upton|first1=Chris|title=Spring-Heeled Jack|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/legacies/myths_legends/england/black_country/article_3.shtml|website=BBC - Legacies - Myths and Legends|publisher=BBC|accessdate=13 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Commemoration==

Joseph Darby is commemorated by a statue in the centre of his native town of Netherton. The statue shows Darby in a crouched position about to leap holding weights in either hand. It is mounted on a plinth which describes some of his exploits. The statue, designed by Steve Field and fabricated by D.R. Harvey, was installed on 29 November 1991.&lt;ref name="Joe Darby Obelisk"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Noszlopy|first1=George|last2=Waterhouse|first2=Fiona|title=Public Sculpture of Staffordshire and the Black Country|date=2005|publisher=Liverpool University Press|location=Liverpool|isbn=978-0853239994|pages=89–90}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is an exhibition of Joe Darby memorabilia in Dudley Museum at the Archives, including his championship belts.&lt;ref name="Treasures"&gt;{{cite web |title=Treasures of the Museum |url=http://www.dudley.gov.uk/see-and-do/museums/dudley-museum-at-the-archives/treasures-of-the-museum/ |website=Dudley MBC |publisher=Dudley MBC |accessdate=24 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Joseph Darby is also commemorated in a bronze plaque set into the pavement of Dudley's marketplace as part of the "Dudley Time Trail" designed by Dudley borough artist, Steve Field.&lt;ref name="Time Trail"&gt;{{cite web|title=Work begins on Dudley Time Trail|url=http://www.dudley.gov.uk/media/media-releases/july-2015/31-work-begins-on-dudley-time-trail/|website=Dudley MBC|publisher=Dudley MBC|accessdate=8 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8939">'''Kattaikkuttu''' is a rural theatre form practiced in the State of [[Tamil Nadu]] in South [[India]].&lt;ref name="Jackie1999"&gt;{{cite book | author=Jackie Assayag | title=The Resources of history: Tradition, narration and nation in South Asia | year=1999 | publisher=École française d'Extrême-Orient | isbn=978-2-85539-607-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The performers – by tradition only men - sing, act and dance and the musicians accompany them on the [[Pump organ|harmonium]], the ''[[mridangam]]'' and the ''mukavinai''. The terms '''[[Terukkuttu]]''' and Kattaikkuttu are often used interchangeably. However, historically the two terms appear to have distinguished, at least in certain villages, between two different kinds of performance: while ''Terukkuttu'' referred to mobile performances by two actors participating in a procession for the village deity [[Mariamman]], ''Kattaikkuttu'' denotes overnight, narrative performances at a fixed performance space acted by an ensemble of about fifteen actors and musicians.&lt;ref name="Hanne_flexibility"&gt;{{cite book

==History==

Kattaikkuttu derives its name from the word ''kattai'', which refers to the special ornaments worn by the actors during performances; ''kuttu'' refers to theatre. The audience recognizes the various characters by the shapes of their head wear and their make-up.&lt;ref name="Hanne_flexibility"/&gt;

Kattaikkuttu has been performed in rural Tamil Nadu for years. In November 1990, a group of seventeen rural actors and musicians founded, on the initiative of Kattaikkuttu actor Perungattur ''P. Rajagopal'', an organization to promote their theatre in the town of [[Kanchipuram]] in Tamil Nadu. They called this grassroots collective the ''Tamil Nadu Kattaikkuttu Kalai Valarcci Munnerra Sangam'' using the name of Kattaikkuttu rather than one of the current terms of ''Kuttu'' or ''Terukkuttu''. The main objectives of the ''Sangam'' – an officially registered society - were to promote Kattaikkuttu as a theatre form in its own right and to further the interests of professional performers. Since its inception more than twenty years ago, the Sangam has developed into an umbrella organization with a number of activities including educating and training a future generation of young, talented Kattaikkuttu performers (''the Kattaikkuttu Gurukulam''), opening up the theatre to rural girls and women, organization of an annual theatre festival and production of new and often innovative plays. In 2009 the organization shortened its name into ''Kattaikkuttu Sangam''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Repertory==
Many traditional performances center on the enactment of parts of the [[Mahabharata]]; a few plays have [[Purana]] stories as their theme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; To cater to a renewed interest in the theatre from urban audiences and cultural institutions,  new plays of shorter and all-night duration have also been created. These plays have been successfully performed in Indian metros and abroad and have been assimilated into the repertory of the Kattaikkuttu Gurukulam’s Young Professionals Company.

A few of the core plays of the traditional Kattaikkuttu repertory are:
* ''The Bending of the Bow'' or ''[[Draupadi]]’s Marriage''
* ''[[Subhadra]]’s Marriage''
* ''The Royal Sacrifice''
* ''The Disrobing of Draupadi''
* ''[[Arjuna]]’s Penance''
* ''Kichaka’s Battle''
* ''[[Krishna]]’s Embassy''
* ''[[Karna]] Moksham''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

*''The Eighteenth Day (featuring [[Duryodhana]]’s death on the battlefield of [[Kurukshetra]])''
*''Dakshya’s Sacrifice''
*''HiranyaVilasam''

Kattaikkuttu is usually performed in a religious setting and performances take place overnight: they start around 10pm and run until 6am the next morning. The occasions for Kattaikkuttu performances can be divided into the following categories:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

#Paratam (Mahabharata) festivals in honor of the Goddess
#Other village festivals such as those for Mariyamman, Ankalamman, Shiva and Vishnu 
#Rites of individuals such as death rites
#Secular occasions e.g. cultural festivals
The Kattaikkuttu Gurukulam is regularly visited by prominent scholars in the theatre world--for example, Bennington College professor Sue Rees regularly visits the school to produce [https://vimeo.com/user5142370 short videos and documentaries] which feature various Kattaikkuttu works. 

==Style==
Kattaikkuttu derives its name from the fact that a specific category of actors wear the so-called ''kattai'' or ''kattai samankal''. Kattai are wooden head, shoulder and the breast ornaments inlaid with mirror work. The kattai represent power, heroic qualities and royalty. The kattai-wearers represent [[superhuman]] – divine or demonic – warriors who are the main agents in the mythological battles around which the performances are built.

The ''acting arena'' is an open rectangular ground and the audience sits on three sides of the ground. The singers and the instrument players occupy the rear of the stage. The play begins with a musical introduction and songs in praise to several different deities. The first character to appear on stage is the [[clown]] or ''Kattiyakkaran'' (literally ''Praise Maker''). The Kattiyakkaran is central to Kattaikkuttu performances: he provides entertainment, serves as the guardian of and opposite number for the principal characters and translates events from the epic and Puranic stories into everyday life experiences of the rural audiences. After his comic introduction, the Kattiyakkaran announces the title of the play to be performed and the entry of one of the principal characters. The stage entry of most kattai characters takes place behind a curtain held across the stage by two assistant performers. Such a ''curtain entry'' requires the actor to perform a prescribed routine of songs and dance. All Kattaikkuttu actors sing themselves, supported by the chorus.

==About the Gurukulam==

The ''Kattaikkuttu Gurukulam'' was founded in October 2002 by actor, playwright and director ''P. Rajagopal'' and ''Dr. Hanne M. de Bruin'' to preserve and enhance the scope of the Kattaikkuttu theatre and safeguard the artistic and economic position of its future exponents. The students are marginalized, young rural people between 5 and 20 years with a keen interest in the theatre form. Located 8 kilometers away from Kanchipuram in a small village called Punjarasantankal, the Kattaikkuttu Gurukulam follows the [[Guru-shishya tradition|guru-shishya system]] of transmission. This means that students and teachers are in constant close contact with each other in formal and non-formal settings. The Gurukulam's students are tutored in life and in all aspects of the Perungattur style of Kattaikkuttu apart from receiving a formal education.

The Kattaikkuttu Gurukulam comes under the auspices of the Kattaikkuttu Sangam. It runs its own theatre company, the Kattaikkuttu Young Professionals consisting of senior students and graduates of the Gurukulam. The girl students of the Kattaikkuttu Gurukulam have their own ensemble, the Kattaikkuttu All-Girls Company, which serves as a laboratory to experiment with gender sensitive issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

'''''Legends of Dawn''''' is a [[single-player]] [[open world]] [[Role-playing game|role-playing]] video game developed by the [[Croatia]]n developer [[Dreamatrix Game Studios]] and published by [[Valve Corporation]] via their digital distribution platform [[Steam (software)|Steam]]. It was released worldwide on 27 June 2013 for [[Microsoft Windows]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/234980/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-10-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141010115518/http://store.steampowered.com/app/234980 |archivedate=2014-10-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Set within a fictional world of Narr, which spans several continents, the player is free to explore and progress at his or her own pace.

==About the game==

{{Empty section|date=October 2014}}

==Development==
It is unknown when the developers started working on the game, however, several months prior to release Dreamatrix initiated a Kickstarter project through a proxy company Aurofinity requesting $25,000 to actually finish the game,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/522716131/legends-of-dawn&lt;/ref&gt; quoting the need to finance the various plug-ins integrated in the proprietary engine. The project was successfully funded on January 18 of 2013., yielding $46,536. With $21,536 of surplus financing, the community and the critics believed they had more than enough to adequately finish the game. Upon release, multiple questions arose as to where exactly the invested money went as the game was an absolute failure in all regards, with [[IGN]] going as far to calling out [[Steam (software)|Steam]] for publishing an obviously broken game in their review,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/07/16/legends-of-dawn-review&lt;/ref&gt; stating: ''"Legends Of Dawn isn’t just bad, it’s an embarrassment to its developers and @steam_games for selling it."''

==Reception==
The game has been universally panned by critics, holding the score of 29/100&lt;ref&gt;http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/legends-of-dawn&lt;/ref&gt; on [[Metacritic]]. It was included in [[IGN|IGN's]] round-up of worst reviewed games of 2013,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/12/18/the-best-worst-reviewed-games-of-2013&lt;/ref&gt; with the description: ''"Legends Of Dawn isn’t just bad, it’s an embarrassment."'' '''CD-Action''' gave it 10/100 stating: ''"An apology is in order to everyone who fell for the promises on Kickstarter and paid for this ruin of a game."'' '''LEVEL''' commented in their review: ''"A crappy system, technologically speaking it's an unfinished, irritating, and every now and then arrogant action RPG, with flaws as merits, demonstrating how to not make a game."'', giving it 20/100.

'''''Lilly van Java''''' ('''''Lily of Java'''''), also known as '''''Melatie van Java''''' ('''''Jasmine of Java'''''),{{sfn|Said|1982|p=17}} is a 1928 film from the [[Dutch East Indies]] directed by [[Wong brothers|Nelson Wong]]. Initially meant to be produced by South Sea Film and shot by an American director, the film&amp;nbsp;– which follows a woman told to marry a man she does not love&amp;nbsp;– was ultimately completed by Wong's Halimoen Film. Details on its cast and performance are contradictory, although the film is recognised as the first of a long series of [[Chinese Indonesians|ethnic Chinese]]-produced films in the country.{{sfn|Biran|2009|pp=379–381}} It is likely a [[lost film]].

==Premise==
The young daughter of a rich man, already in a loving relationship, is forced to marry someone she does not love.{{sfn|Filmindonesia.or.id, Lily van Java}}

==Production==
The first two films produced in the [[Dutch East Indies]], ''[[Loetoeng Kasaroeng]]'' (1926) and ''[[Eulis Atjih]]'' (1927), were made by the Dutch filmmakers L. Heuveldorp and [[G. Kruger]], respectively.{{sfn|Biran|2009|p=379}} [[Chinese Indonesians|Ethnic Chinese]] businessmen, capitalising on the success of films produced in [[Shanghai]], China, established two [[production house]]s, one in Batavia (modern day [[Jakarta]]) and the other in [[Surabaya]].{{sfn|Biran|2009|p=77}} South Sea Film, the production house in Batavia established by Liem Goan Lian and Tjan Tjoen Lian, was advertised as the first Chinese filmmaking [[cooperative]] in the country. Its first script was for ''Lily van Java'';{{sfn|Filmindonesia.or.id, Lily van Java}}{{sfn|Biran|2009|p=79}} which the company had to pass through the {{lang|nl|Film Commissie}} (national censorship bureau) for fear of violating traditional values.{{sfn|PaEni 2010, Mozaik Film Nasional}}

According to JB Kristanto's ''Katalog Film Indonesia'' (''Indonesian Film Catalogue''), an American named Len Ross was initially booked to direct the film;{{sfn|Filmindonesia.or.id, Lily van Java}} Ross was reportedly in the country to film a work entitled ''Java'' for [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] and shot several scenes in mid-1928.{{sfn|Biran|2009|p=80}} The cast was ethnic Chinese, and the female stars&amp;nbsp;– Lie Lian Hwa and Lie Bo Tan&amp;nbsp;– were reportedly daughters of the Surabayan gangster Lie Bauw Kie and trained in [[silat]];{{sfn|Biran|2009|p=82}} other cast members included Kwee Tiang An and Yah Kwee Pang. However, after Ross withdrew the script was put on hold.{{sfn|Filmindonesia.or.id, Lily van Java}}

[[Wong brothers|Nelson Wong]], who had formerly been booked with his brothers Joshua and Othniel to record a film for [[Tio Tek Djien]],{{sfn|Biran|2009|p=81}} approached David Wong (no relation), a high-ranking [[General Motors]] employee in Batavia, for funding. With this the Wong Brother's Halimoen Film was able to finish the film.{{sfn|Filmindonesia.or.id, Lily van Java}}{{sfn|Biran|2009|p=82}}{{sfn|JCG, Lily van Java}} Some sources indicate that the same cast was used,{{sfn|Filmindonesia.or.id, Lily van Java}}{{sfn|Biran|2009|p=82}} while others suggest that the leading role was taken by a student from Shanghai named Lily Oey.{{sfn|Said|1982|p=17}}{{sfn|van der Heide|2002|p=128}}{{sfn|Biran|Ramadhan K.H.|Labrousse|1973|p=165}}

The [[silent film]] was shot in [[black and white]];{{sfn|Filmindonesia.or.id, Lily van Java}} its [[intertitle]]s were bilingual, written in both [[Malay language|Malay]] and Chinese.{{sfn|Biran|2009|p=82}} The American film historian [[Richard Abel (cultural historian)|Richard Abel]] writes that the film's technical quality, like all other local productions of the time, was poor and unable to compete with imported works,{{sfn|Abel|2005|p=462}} and the Indonesian film scholar [[Misbach Yusa Biran]] writes that the shots were considered blurry even at the time.{{sfn|Biran|2009|p=86}}

==Release and reception==
''Lily van Java'' was released in 1928.{{sfn|Filmindonesia.or.id, Lily van Java}} Its success is disputed. The reporter Leopold Gan wrote that the film was highly successful, to the point that after several years copies were worn through from overplaying.{{sfn|Biran|2009|p=82}} However, Joshua Wong later recalled in an interview that the film had been a failure; David Wong is reported to have avowed to no longer fund any films after ''Lily van Java''.{{sfn|Biran|2009|p=84}} Lacking a backer, the Wong Brothers went on hiatus.{{sfn|Biran|2009|p=86}}

''Lily van Java'' continues to be recorded as the first Chinese-produced film of the area.{{sfn|JCG, Lily van Java}} Although the Wongs went on hiatus, other ethnic Chinese became involved in film. Several Chinese owned start-ups are recorded from 1929 on, including Nancing Film with ''[[Resia Boroboedoer]]'' (1928) and [[Tan's Film]] with ''[[Njai Dasima (1929 film)|Njai Dasima]]'' (1929).{{sfn|Biran|2009|p=379}} By the early 1930s Chinese-owned businesses were the dominating force in the country's film industry.{{sfn|Biran|2009|pp=380–381}}

The film is likely a [[lost film]]. The American visual anthropologist [[Karl G. Heider]] writes that all Indonesian films from before 1950 are lost.{{sfn|Heider|1991|p=14}} However, JB Kristanto's ''Katalog Film Indonesia'' (''Indonesian Film Catalogue'') records several as having survived at [[Sinematek Indonesia]]'s archives, and Biran writes that several Japanese propaganda films have survived at the [[Netherlands Government Information Service]].{{sfn|Biran|2009|p=351}}

[[File:Susanne Bier 2013 (cropped).jpg|200px|thumb|[[Susanne Bier]] was the first Danish woman to win the award, for ''[[In a Better World]]''.]]
Since the inaugural award in 1956 [[Denmark]] has submitted fifty-six films for consideration for the [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Film]], eleven of which succeeded in getting nominated for the Academy Award: ''[[Qivitoq]]'' (1958), ''[[Paw (film)|Paw]]'' (1959), ''[[Harry and the Butler]]'' (1960), ''[[Babette's Feast]]'' (1987), ''[[Pelle the Conqueror]]'' (1988), ''[[Memories of a Marriage]]'' (1989), ''[[After the Wedding]]'' (2006), ''[[In a Better World]]'' (2010), ''[[A Royal Affair]]'' (2012), ''[[The Hunt (2012 film)|The Hunt]]'' (2013) and ''[[A War]]'' (2015). Three Danish movies have won the Oscar: ''[[Babette's Feast]]'' (1987), ''[[Pelle the Conqueror]]'' (1988) and ''[[In a Better World]]'' (2010).

The official Danish submission is selected annually in late summer by the [[Danish Film Institute]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.variety.com/awardcentral_article/VR1117990889.html?nav=news&amp;categoryid=1982&amp;cs=1 | work=Variety | title=Denmark sends 'Worlds' to Oscars | first=Gunnar | last=Rehlin | date=2008-08-21 | access-date=24 May 2009 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080919090849/http://www.variety.com/awardcentral_article/VR1117990889.html?nav=news&amp;categoryid=1982&amp;cs=1 | archive-date=19 September 2008 | dead-url=yes | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1957, Denmark became the first country to send a film with a female director to the Foreign Oscar competition ([[Annelise Hovmand|Annelise Hovmand's]] ''[[Be Dear to Me]]''). Two years later, [[Astrid Henning-Jensen|Astrid Henning-Jensen's]] ''[[Paw (film)|Paw]]'' became to the first film directed by a woman to receive a nomination in the category.

Between 1998 and 2002, four out of five Danish submissions were made according to the austere [[Dogme 95]] principles. None were nominated and none have been submitted since.

==Submissions==
The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences has invited the film industries of various countries to submit their best film for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film since 1956. The Foreign Language Film Award Committee oversees the process and reviews all the submitted films. Following this, they vote via [[secret ballot]] to determine the five nominees for the award.&lt;ref name="Rules"&gt;{{cite web|title=Rule Thirteen: Special Rules for the Foreign Language Film Award |work=Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences |publisher=[[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] |url=http://www.oscars.org/awards/academyawards/rules/86/rule13.html |accessdate=2013-08-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130822101822/http://www.oscars.org/awards/academyawards/rules/86/rule13.html |archivedate=22 August 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Below is a list of the films that have been submitted by Denmark for review by the Academy for the award by year.

{{Italic title}}
'''''Maléfices''''' ([[French language|French]]: "''[[Maleficium (sorcery)|Evil Acts]]''" or "''[[Curse|Hexes]]''") is a French role-playing game created by Michel Gaudo and Guillaume Rohmer. It was published by game company [[Jeux Descartes]] from 1985 to 1994 and was the first original French-language horror role-playing game. Although it had well-crafted adventures, it lost market share to Chaosium's ''[[Call of Cthulhu (role-playing game)|Call of Cthulhu]]'', which expanded on the fanbase that ''Maléfices'' itself had created. This is ironic because '''''Call of Cthulhu''''' was printed earlier under license by Jeux Descartes as '''''l'Appel de Cthulhu''''', starting with their translation of Chaosium's Second Edition of the rules in 1984. 

The core rules have been published in three editions: the 1st in 1985 and 2nd (Revised Edition) in 1988 by [[Jeux Descartes]]. The expanded 3rd Edition (288 pages long - triple the size of the earlier volumes) was printed in 2004 by ''Editions du Club Pythagore''. They began work on new material, publishing the adventures ''Danse Macabre'' ("The Grim Dance") and ''La Cornemuse du Vieux Jeremiah'' ("Old Jeremiah's Bagpipes"), and sold [[Portable Document Format|PDFs]] of the old material. The 3rd Edition was later reprinted in 2007 by [[Asmodee|Asmodée Éditions]].

In 2016 Arkhane Asylum Publishing received the rights to ''Maléfices'' from Michel Gaudo. In 2018 they were crowdfunded through [[Ulule]] to began work on a new version of the game (comprising a new core book, game screen, and Tarot Deck), with new supporting material to come. They would also reissue compatible versions of the old supplements and adventures. The first reissues are to be ''Une Étrange Maison de Poupée'' ("A Strange Doll's House") and ''Le Drame de la Rue des Récollets'' ("A Drama on the Street of the Recollects"). A gaming magazine, ''L’Étoile du Matin'' ("The Morning Star"), would also be created that would exclusively print articles and material supporting Maléfices. 

==Setting==
&lt;big&gt;'''''Maléfices''''' - ''le jeu de rôle qui sent le soufre...'' ("the role-playing game with the scent of sulphur")&lt;/big&gt;

The game is set during the early part of the [[Third Republic (France)|French Third Republic]] (1870–1940). It is a time where the reason, science and industry of the cities is confronting the superstitions, legends, and witchcraft of the countryside. The players' characters are ordinary people, who belong to ''le Club Pythagore'' ("The [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagorean]] Club"), an association of gentlemen (and ladies) dedicated to fighting the darkness, with the help of Faith, Science, or even Magic.

The players must expect mystery and the supernatural rather than the gore and overt fantastical elements of other horror games. However, whether the threat is a haunted house or a mad scientist, the cloven footprints of the Devil are found not far off. Much like ''Call of Cthulhu'', ''Malefices'' was about investigators trying to stop evil forces from destroying mankind but just delaying the inevitable for a while. The start of the [[First World War]] in 1914 apparently heralds the beginning of the end.

==Mechanics==
The game uses a pair of [[decahedron|ten-sided dice]] and a deck of tarot cards to resolve actions. A '''d10''' roll would use the results of one ten-sided die. A '''d100''' roll uses one ten-sided die of one color as the "tens" column and one ten-sided die as the "ones" column to generate percentages.

A color-coded table divided by percents or ranges of numbers generated by the dice indicates the results (much like TSR's [[Marvel Super Heroes Adventure Game|Marvel Super Heroes RPG]]). The results are divided into "A", "B", "C", "D" and "Failure", like a report card. "A" is a perfect or "excellent" result that is an automatic success. The others are spectrums of success with "B" being "good", "C" being "average" and "D" being "borderline". "Failure" is an automatic failure, but its degree is judged by subtracting the result of the botched roll from the value of the maximum level of success.

The results are modified by drawing [[Tarot de Malefices|tarot cards]], much like the Poker deck used in Classic [[Deadlands]]. One interesting mechanic is that the ''La Chance'' ("Luck") card grants the character an extra life when drawn and the ''La Mort'' ("Death") card allows the [[Game Master|MJ (''Meneur de Jeu'', or "Game Master")]] to kill the character whenever he chooses. An interesting effect is that players who have the "Death" card hovering over them might engage in risky behavior that requires the drawing of more cards in the hope of drawing a "Luck" card, much like  a gambler in the hole might do.

==Attributes==
''Personnages Joueurs'' ("Player Characters") have seven attributes: 4 Bodily attributes, 2 Spiritual Attributes, and 1 Magical Attribute.

The player first picks a profession and has to roll on a d100 chart for the Age and Constitution of the character, which affect the bodily attributes. The four bodily attributes are ''Capacités Physiques'' ("Physical Abilities", or Strength), ''Habileté'' ("Ability" or Dexterity), ''Culture Générale'' ("General Knowledge" or Education), and ''Perception'' ("Alertness"). Female characters have a period-based limitation on the professions they may choose. ''Capacités Physiques'' is based on Age, Constitution, and Profession, while the latter three (''Habileté'', ''Culture Générale'', and ''Perception'') are just based on Age and Profession.

The two opposing spiritual attributes are ''Ouverture d'Esprit'' ("Open-Mindedness", or Reason) and ''Spiritualité'' ("Spirituality", or Faith). They are point-based and are created by dividing 20 points between them (much like the contrasting attributes in the '''''[[Pendragon (role-playing game)|Pendragon]]''''' RPG). Characters start with a minimum level of 6 in either attribute. These attributes have a lot of in-game effects, but in general ''Ouverture d'Esprit'' gives a bonus to resist fear and ''Spiritualité'' gives a bonus to resist occult manipulation.

''Fluide'' ("Flow" or "Supernatural Powers"), the seventh attribute (with a minimum level of 5), is secretly rolled by the ''Meneur de Jeu'' for the character. It determines how well they can manipulate the supernatural realm. It grants a bonus to one of the three magical attributes (all of which normally have a base level of "0"). ''Seuil de Pratique de la Magie Blanche'' (SPMB, "Threshold for Practicing White Magic") and ''Seuil de Pratique de la Magie Noire'' (SPMN, "Threshold for Practicing Black Magic") are the attributes for the use of magic. ''Seuil de Pratique de la Magie Autre'' (SPMA, "Threshold for Practicing Other Magic") is the attribute for using Psychic powers or sensing the supernatural realm. Only the ''Mener de Jeu'' knows what the bonus is and to which form of magic it applies. This keeps magic and psychic powers a dangerous mystery to the players. To every magical effect, a number is associated, called ''Seuil de Pratique de l'Acte'' (SPA, "Threshold for Practice of the Act"). This gives the difficulty of the effect and the chance for side-effects and botches. ''Fluide'' rolls are handled as the opposite of Skill or Action rolls (kind of like The Devil was making the roll rather than the player). A failure means there are no consequences and "D", "C", "B" and "A" are botches. A botched roll has dire consequences, with "D" being minor and "A" being serious or even deadly for the character.

Then a spread of five Tarot cards are drawn, like a hand of Poker. Four are shown to the player and one is kept secret by the ''Meneur de Jeu'' (the Dealer). They are interpreted to affect the character, granting bonuses and penalties to ''Fluide'' and the types of magic. For example ''L'Archange'' (the Archangel) and ''Le Vicaire'' give bonuses to ''Spiritualité'' and SPMB, ''Le Diable'' and ''Le Sorcier'' give bonuses to ''Ouverture d'Esprit'' and SPMN, and ''Le Grand Livre'' gives you bonuses to ''Fluide'', ''Ouverture d'Esprit'' and ''Spiritualité''. The hidden card and its influence is kept secret from the player.

==Rules Sets==

===First Edition / Revised (Second Edition)===
The first and second edition rules came in a box set with the rulebook, adventure booklet, 4-panel game master screen, 2 ten-sided dice, 20 cardboard tarot cards, and 21 two-sided cardboard character figures with plastic standee bases.

The [[Tarot de Malefices|Tarot deck]] (referred to as ''le Grand Jeu de la Connaissance'' - "the Great Game of Knowledge") was designed by LeCordelier and illustrated by Gilles Lautussier. In the First Edition, the Tarot cards were in black and white and were unfinished pre-punched cardboard. The deck in the Revised Edition was in color and the cards were laminated.

The Rulebook was 56 pages. It contained a 2-page foreword titled "From the Sea to The Devil", 25 pages of rules, 25 pages of historical and cultural information, a 2-page bibliography, a Table of Contents page, and an afterword page titled "The Bear". The rules covered character creation, the system mechanics, the combat rules, magic rules, and the creation and use of Non-Player Characters, animals and supernatural creatures. The historical material was divided into three parts. "France between 1870 and 1914" was an 11-page historical essay covering the [[Belle Époque]] period. "Chronicle" was a 4-page timeline of French history. "Witchcraft, Beliefs and Superstition in Nineteenth-century France" was a 10-page essay discussing occult practices of the time.

The 48-page Adventure Booklet contained a four page article of cultural and sociological data about France at the turn of the century. It also contained the two beginning scenarios ''La Malédiction de Fontevrault'' (''The Curse at Fontevrault'') and ''Une Etrange Maison de Poupées'' (''A Strange Dolls' House'').

===Third Edition===
The third edition was a 288-page hardcover book.

A great deal of it (136 pages total) is historical and sociological information. ''Lever de Rideau'' ("Raising The Curtain") is a 23-page article describing previous historical eras in French history: the [[First French Empire|First Empire]] [1804-1815], the [[Bourbon Restoration]] [1814-1830], the [[July Monarchy]] [1830-1848], the [[French Second Republic|Second Republic]] [1848-1852], and the [[French Second Republic|Second Empire]] [1852-1870]. It also discusses the great influences of the [[Year of Revolution]] [1848], the [[Franco-Prussian war]] [1870-1871] and the [[Paris Commune|Commune of Paris]] [1871]. "The [[French Third Republic|Third Republic]]" [1870-1940] is a 23-page section on the conflicting social and political concepts of the [[Belle Époque]] period [1870-1914], from the beginning of the Franco-Prussian War to the dawn of [[World War One]]. "Chronicle" is a 34-page timeline of French history from 1870 to 1914. "Life in 1900" is a 20-page section that details the lifestyle, fashions, leisure activities, and habits of the period for both the city and the countryside. The "Belle Époque Guide" is a 20-page section detailing printed news media, modes of travel (train, carriage and early motor cars), and communication methods (the postal service, telegraph and telephone) of the Belle Époque period. "Crime and Punishment" is a 20-page section on the police services, investigative and forensic techniques of the period, the [[Napoleonic Code|Law]], procedures of trial and judgement, and typical sentences and punishments. There is also a 16-page section on the scientific, spiritual, and occult theories and beliefs of the period like evolution, [[Spiritualism]], and [[Anticlericalism#Third Republic|anti-clericalism]].

==Scenarios==

In September 1902, the characters are invited to attend a session of the Pythagorean Club by its President, Monsieur Caton. This very discreet club is interested in all activities of human thought and is recruiting members of an open, inquisitive and objective mind. A strange package arrives at the club: a [[Dollhouse|doll's house]], which is full of mysteries. Attached to it is a letter reading: ''"Businessman, to be away a few days seeks person of confidence that can keep his children. Contact Mr Léon Berthomé, Rue Pergolèse, [[16th arrondissement of Paris|16th District]], [[Arrondissements of Paris|Paris]]."'' Will the characters respond to the attached announcement?

They will have to unravel why one of their friends was the target of an assassination attempt. On the way they will contend with a desecrated grave, a variety of crooks and thieves, and a murderous psychopath.

===Modules===

==== No.1 Le drame de la rue des Récollets (''A Tragedy in the Street of the [[Recollects]]'') [1985] by Michel Gaudo. ====
The investigators go to [[Versailles (commune)|Versailles]] at the invitation of Madame Hyacinthe Passelat, the local bookseller. Can we dream of a city quieter than Versailles, so close to the capital and yet so full of provincial sweetness? But should we trust appearances? Is her house truly haunted or is she prone to imaginary fears? However, it seems that in the night at the house in the Rue des Récollets, the walls cry! But how can anyone believe such a thing?

==== No.2 L'énigmatique carnet du Capitaine Pop Plinn (''The Puzzling Notebook of Captain Pop Plinn'') [1985] by Hervé Fontanières ====
Who can say what happened to Professor Labessonnier, director of the lunatic asylum at [[Rennes]], gone nearly five months ago? Is he gone, like everyone suggests, in search of Captain Pop Plinn, one of his own patients, who escaped from the hospital a year earlier? Camille Labessonnier, the daughter of the [[alienist]], despaired by months of fruitless searches, gathers a group of reliable friends for a last-ditch attempt. To guide them, they will have available to them the strange captain's log book, found twice on the same beach in [[Finistère]]. Is the key to the mystery hidden in the obscure prose of a madman? Can they expect to trace the two men? But what power lies at the end of this pilgrimage through the beauties and mysteries of the Breton countryside?

==== No.3 Délivrez-nous du mal (''"Deliver Us from Evil..."'') [1986] by Hervé Fontanières ====
In the month of June, there is peace at the monastery of St. Bernard of Bel-Ange. Life goes on away from the fury of men in the quiet, unchanging rhythm of prayer and meditation. They are four monks for whom fulfillment is found within the walls of this Cistercian abbey, where they spent most of their existence and where they hope to complete it. One of their old comrades, Brother Julian, just left them. But they chased the sadness from their hearts because they are convinced that after death begins a new life. And then suddenly, everything seems to be falling into chaos. Should the cook doubt his art, the steward of his honesty, the gardener of his dedication, the librarian's ability to resist the lure of bad books? What is this storm of madness which suddenly starts to blow on the monastery? Is it a man or a demon who, in the shadow of the cloister, has vowed to plunge this house of prayer into confusion?

==== No.4 Les brasiers ne s'éteignent jamais (''The Fires Never Burn Out'') [1986] by Michel Gaudo ====
No, the fires never go out. In 17th century [[Loudun]], [[Urbain Grandier|Father Urbain Grandier]], the pastor at the parish of St.Pierre-du-Marche, perished in flames at the stake. Thus ended [[Loudun possessions|the most famous case of witchcraft]] that has ever been heard. More than 300 years later, Loudon is about to feel the priest's vengeance. Will the innocent people perish? Demons lurk around the peaceful town; will they need to be paid in souls for the fires to be extinguished at last?

==== No.5 Le dompteur de volcans (''The Tamer of Volcanoes'') [1986] by Michel Gaudo ====
A wave of madness is blowing through the Pythagorean Club. Judge for yourself: a fakir came to give a lecture - a young girl does not hesitate to tell us - on the secrets of his body. Then the rush of events:  disappearances, killings, and  prosecutions shake the club members. The press is unleashed, the capital is in turmoil - even the provinces are not immune. Amid this whirlwind of events, can you remain calm enough to oppose the terrible threat of The Tamer of Volcanoes? 

The first part of the adventure is a slow-paced investigation into an assault on a club member and the disappearance and murder of a strange woman. The second part is a race against time involving a train trip into the countryside of [[Auvergne]], the abduction of a woman from a circus, and a confrontation with a mad scientist. Includes a study of the [[Bamar people|Birman]] [[Fakir]]s, a short story by [[Ambrose Bierce]], a two-dimensional cardboard cutout of an antique statue, a color poster for the eccentric Cirque de Roumanoff, and a dozen handouts and props.

==== No.6 Enchères sous pavillon noir (''Bidding on a Black Banner'') [1987] by Pascal Gaudo====
The investigators buy a chest containing an old pirate flag at auction and get involved in a Caribbean deep-sea treasure hunt. They aren't the only ones, however. There is a shadowy and formidable rival group that is following their trail that is as "greedy" as they are. Also includes information about Voodoo and the lives of pirates.

==== No.7 La musique adoucit les meurtres (''Music Makes Murders Much Sweeter'') [1987] by Michel Gaudo ====
&lt;div class="center" style="width: auto; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;''"When I want to kill, I kill; I often do just that, and no one is stopping me.&lt;br&gt; Human laws even pursue me  with their revenge, but my conscience does not reproach me."''&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class="center" style="width: auto; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;- ''&lt;u&gt;[[Les Chants de Maldoror]]&lt;/u&gt;'', ''Fourth Canto'' by the [[Comte de Lautréamont]] (1868).&lt;/div&gt;Wherein the members of the Pythagorean Club will get to know the little brother of [[Fantômas]], which like his predecessor is: "''...always someone (sometimes two people), but never himself''". In this sequel to '''Une Etrange Maison de Poupées''', the players must contend with a clever enemy out to exact his dark revenge upon them.

==== No.8 Le montreur d'ombres (''The Caster of Shadows'') [1987] by Hervé Fontanières ====
On the gentle shores of [[Lake Annecy]], a great event is in the making. The charming resort of [[Haute-Savoie]] is home to the first congress of a newly founded academy of the sciences and humanities. Among the greatest scholars from around the world, the characters will be striving with the most illustrious. So much so that they can (why not?) lay claim to the presidency of the association. But while everyone gets drunk with pride in this race for honors, the characters are quickly and inexplicably struck by serious mental disorders that will only worsen. Will they end their life in an asylum, suffering from early senility just when Glory held out her arms? Unless the reality is much worse ... In these circumstances, is it really time to take their testimony seriously? Does an aquatic monster really haunt the lake bottom?

==== No.9 Folies viennoises (A pun meaning either ''Viennese Cabaret'' or ''Viennese Madness'') [1988] by Daniel Bilous &amp; Nicole Bilous ====
:"''Mein herr, the Waltz is a rhythm of three parts: two parts weak and a third movement that is nearly painfully accentuated. It is the exact rhythm of a heart attack. In the thrall of an intense fear, no matter how fast the chambers of the heart accelerate, the rhythm slowly becomes regular. Have you not noticed those times in the past in Vienna when the fast-paced Polka has nearly dethroned the slow-moving Waltz?''"
::"''So am I hearing you say, Herr Doktor, that her terror is supposed to be a normal state?''"
:"''Perhaps it is for the best, Herr Kommissar, perhaps it is for the best...''"
A mystery that takes place in Vienna in 1907, in which a local girl goes mad from fright. The players meet Dr. [[Sigmund Freud]], who is a consulting doctor in the case. Includes information on [[Vienna]] and the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]], Anarchism in Europe, and the [[Vienna Secession]] and [[Bauhaus]] movements.

==== No.10 Cœur cruel (''Cruel Heart'') [1988] by Hervé Fontanières ====
When reading a single letter takes you to hundreds of kilometers from home. Where a mysterious hand goes after the remnants of the past. Where the possessed babble incomprehensible messages. Where, after nearly 700 years, the shadow of the Baron still hangs over Bearn. Where, again and always, love and death find themselves united by blood ties. When life itself becomes unbearable. Where destinies are based, for better or for worse? Where finally no, you do not laugh when you do not see yourself in the mirror...

==== No.11 Le voile de Kali (''The Veil of Kali'') [1994] by Michel Gaudo &amp; Pascal Gaudo ====
The story that the characters will be involved has an international dimension. Involuntarily, they will find themselves immersed in a conflict that is between the French intelligence services and their German rivals, in this case represented by a secret society: [[Vehmic court|The Holy Vehm]]. French and Germans will try to capture the terrible secret of the Veil of Kali. Very soon they will find that it is extremely dangerous to handle dark forces ... especially when you do not control them! Perhaps had they been wiser not to attempt to lift a corner of the veil... But now it's too late to turn their backs to dark powers that once lay dormant for centuries but were woken from their torpor. There remains only one solution ... to conquer or die! The characters find themselves traveling from Egypt to Ceylon to Istanbul and then back to Paris on the Orient Express.

==== No.12 [[Danse macabre]] (''The Grim Dance'') [''Editions du Club Pythagore'' 2004] by Daniel Dugourd ====
The adventure starts with a formal dinner, followed by a [[seance]]. On the way home, the characters witness a robbery and murder at the [[Musée de Cluny]]. The investigators must investigate the crime (and discover what [[Camille Saint-Saëns]]' composition ''[[Danse macabre (Saint-Saëns)|Danse Macabre]]'' has to do with it all...). Contains historical information on the role and influence of the Catholic Church during the Third Republic and the conflicts between religious and anti-clerical groups in France between 1870 and 1900. Also includes 32 pages of handouts, including a cardboard sheet with the drawing of a triptych, the text of the poem "Danse Macabre" by Henri Cazalis, and a ''Club Pythagore'' membership card and letter of acceptance.

==== No.13 La cornemuse du vieux Jeremiah (''Old Jeremiah's [[Bagpipes]]'') [''Editions du Club Pythagore'' 2005]  by Daniel Dugourd ====
One of the characters has recently inherited an estate and a title from his recently deceased rich uncle...along with a family curse and a haunted castle. While staying at his estate in the [[Scottish Highlands|Highlands of Scotland]], he and his guests hear the mysterious sound of bagpipes playing on the moor. Who is playing the bagpipes? Who is trying to kill the host, the last member of the [[Clan Fraser of Lovat|St.Simon family]]? And what secrets does the history of this noble lineage have to reveal? Contains a map of Great Britain, a London newspaper (in French, of course), historical information about Scotland from ancient to [[Victorian era|modern times (1880s)]], and 37 pages of handouts.

==== Les Chasses du Comte Lassary (''The Hunts of Count Lassary'') [1991] by Michel Gaudo. ====
&lt;div class="center" style="width: auto; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;''"When a man wants to kill a tiger. he calls it sport;&lt;br&gt;When a tiger wishes to kill him, he calls it ferocity..."''&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="center" style="width: auto; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;- ''&lt;u&gt;Maxims for Revolutionists&lt;/u&gt;'', ''Line 62'' by [[George Bernard Shaw]] (1903)&lt;/div&gt;The characters have been summoned to the reading of the will of the late Count Lassary, a celebrated hunter. The will appears fake but declares that the testators are all here to search for the real will to give the Count's estate to the true heir.

==== l'Oeil du Diademe ("The Eye of the Tiara") Michel Gaudo [''Editions du Club Pythagore'' Unpublished] ====
A scenario that was never put into production. It was advertised in the adventure ''Danse Macabre'' (2004) that it was originally going to be No. 13 in the series. ''Asmodee Editions'' also announced in 2007 that it was coming out soon, but it remains unfinished. 

Its title refers to an [[optical illusion]] (''[[Forced perspective|Trompe l'Oeil]]'') in the background of a self-portrait by [[Nicolas Poussin]] (1594 – 1665). The viewer's eyes are drawn to a colorful painting in the background over the painter's shoulder rather than to the drab-colored painter himself in the foreground. The painting is of a woman in classic garb who is wearing a tiara with a small red gem in its peak. Conspiracy theorists [[The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail|have said]] that Poussin's paintings contain secret codes or clues. Perhaps the players have to uncover a plot or conspiracy using the clues provided by Poussin's paintings?

==Supplements==

=== A la Lisière de la Nuit (''At the Edge of Night'') [1986] by Hervé Fontanières, Michel Gaudo &amp; Guillaume Rohmer ===
A Sorcery supplement that brings together magic rules and historic examples of spells. Black magic is used for personal purposes and can be done by making a pact with the Devil, while white magic aims for spiritual elevation. These ''sortilèges de malefices'' (hex spells) are not instantaneous and spectacular like balls of fire or curses. No, they are subtle, like protective charms and potions of Love and Luck.

This supplement covers magic and folk superstitions rather than [[Spiritualism]] and psychic powers.

=== Le Bestiaire (''The Bestiary'') [1988]  by Michel Gaudo &amp; Pascal Gaudo ===
The sourcebook is a series of extracts from a variety of sources about animals and monsters, rather than full of statistics or concrete depictions. It is more of an atmospheric guide to help stimulate the Game Master's imagination (and keep investigators from guessing what's really going on). It also contains a brief recounting of the magic rules from ''A la Lisière de la Nuit''.

=== Enfer et Lieux Maudits (''Hell and Cursed Places'') [Unpublished] ===
A sourcebook full of sources describing Hell and The Devil and listing famous cursed locations across France was proposed. However, the series was cancelled by Jeux Descartes in the early 1990s before it could be finished and published.

=== CatéSchisme (A pun implying ''[[Catechism|Doctrine]] of [[Schism (religion)|Factionalization]]'') [''Asmodee Editions'' 2007] by Olivier Babarit, Daniel Dugourd, Michel Gaudo, &amp; Jean-Philippe Palanchini ''Third Edition Rules'' ===
&lt;div class="center" style="width: auto; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;''"When they no longer have priests, the gods become very easy to live with."''&lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div class="center" style="width: auto; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;- &lt;u&gt;''L'Histoire contemporaine №.4: Monsieur Bergeret à Paris''&lt;/u&gt;, by [[Anatole France]] (1901).&lt;/div&gt;

This supplement is composed of a new four-panel Game Master screen, a new color 22-card [[Tarot de Maléfices|Tarot Card]] set, and a 32-page information booklet about Spiritualism.

The booklet is divided in 3 parts. ''Superstitions et Diableries'' ("Superstitions and Deviltry") is a sermon given by a horrified Catholic priest that denounces Spiritualism. ''Les Forces Invisibles'' ("The Invisible Forces") is by a scientist who attended Spiritualist seances and is trying to explain what he saw scientifically. ''Sciences Secrètes des initiés'' ("The Initiates' Secret Knowledge") is a lecture by an occultist named Dr. Theobald to a society called the ''Voiles d'Isis'' ("The Veils of Isis") on how occultism is superior to Science and Spiritualism.

Sidebars contain rules for carrying out Spiritualist rituals and using Spiritualist paraphernalia like [[Scrying|Spirit Mirrors]] and [[Ouija Board]]s to aid in investigations.

=== Le Club Pythagore [''Arkhane Asylum Publishing'' 2019?] === 
A proposed supplement for the Arkhane Asylum Publishing edition. It will concern the club and its prominent members.

'''Marriage plot''' is a term used, often in academic circles, to categorize a [[Plot (narrative)|storyline]] that recurs in novels most prominently and more recently in films. Until the expansion of the definition of marriage to include [[same-sex couple]]s, this [[Plot (narrative)|plot]] centered exclusively on the courtship rituals between a man and a woman and the obstacles that faced the potential couple on its way to the nuptial payoff. The marriage plot became a popular source of entertainment in the 18th and 19th centuries with the rise of the [[middle class]] novel. The foremost practitioners of the form include some of the more illustrious names in English letters, among them [[Samuel Richardson]], [[Jane Austen]], [[George Eliot]] and the [[Brontë sisters]].

==Use in novels==
Post-1980 deconstructionist criticism has highlighted how the plot was a profitable publishing and ideological production that served to ensure the ascendancy of the [[middle class]]. The marriage plot was the liberal age's reformulation of the [[medieval romance]], which excluded all but aristocratic ladies and their chivalrous knights from its epics of love. The marriage plot promises to liberate romance by making it available to greater sections of society: the middle class and to some extent, the [[working class]]es, who are relegated to [[comic relief]] in 16th- and 17th-century theater, suddenly become serious moral subjects. Today, few doubt the ennobling qualities of love, but giving that nobility of soul to anyone but nobles was an innovation to be found foundationally in the marriage plot, perhaps pioneered by Richardson's ''[[Pamela, or Virtue Rewarded|Pamela]]'', wherein a lowly but virtuous maid is raised beyond her birth through her insistent [[chastity]] and her subsequent marriage to the lordly Mr. B.

==Use in film==
Film, which supplanted the novel as the most popular narrative form in the 20th century, did not abandon this innovation of the novel. Rather, the marriage plot has enjoyed a continued efflorescence, visible to this day in the popular film form known as the "[[romantic comedy]]". At its most formulaic, critics have asserted, the conventions of the marriage plot, with the cathartic closure that its marriage ending delivers to its believers, ultimately renounces politics and engagement in the world in favor of privacy and domestic bliss. We may see this, for instance, in the film ''[[You've Got Mail]]'', which resolves the political opposition between mega-bookstore boss [[Tom Hanks]] and bookshop-around-the-corner owner, [[Meg Ryan]], by uniting its lead characters in a union that effaces the unequal distribution of capital that originally put them at odds.

'''Metanet Software Inc.''' is an [[Independent video game development|independent]] [[Video game developer|game development]] company founded in 2001 by Mare Sheppard and Raigan Burns. It is based in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]], [[Canada]].

In March 2004, Metanet published a [[platform game]] called ''[[N (video game)|N]]'', which received the Audience Choice Award at the [[Independent Games Festival]] in 2005, and the Audience Choice Award at the [[Slamdance Film Festival#Slamdance Guerrilla Games Competition|Slamdance Guerrilla Games Competition]] in 2006. ''N'' is currently in version 2.0. The company had planned to develop a new game, code-named "Robotology", but has since been put on indefinite hiatus. In an interview given to [[PC Gamer]] magazine, Metanet stated that Robotology will heavily feature ropes and focus on physics behavior. In early 2013, Metanet released a beta version of N 2.0 in-browser, and on May 18, 2013, released the N 2.0 proper.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.metanetsoftware.com/blog/2013/n-v2-0-is-here&lt;/ref&gt;

Metanet has also released other projects, including ''Office Yeti'', which is, according to Metanet, a free flash single-player action/puzzle/simulation game in which players assume control of a yeti who works in an office, and also stated that the game is like: "[[Skool Daze]] + [[Harry the Handsome Executive]] + Metanet = Office [[Yeti]]".

Metanet announced that it will alternate between [[freeware]] and [[shareware]] for its upcoming releases. ''[[N+]]'' has been released on the [[Xbox Live Arcade]] service, the [[Nintendo DS]], and the [[Sony]] [[PlayStation Portable]]. N++ released for PS4 as a [[Console exclusivity|timed exclusive]] on 28 July 2015, and it was released via [[Steam (software)|Steam]] on August 26, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;[http://store.steampowered.com/app/230270 N++]&lt;/ref&gt; It received a [[Nintendo Switch]] release on 24 May, 2018,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.destructoid.com/n-is-coming-to-switch-after-all-502600.phtml&lt;/ref&gt; including an upcoming limited-run physical release on the console&lt;ref&gt;https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=1837763672950923&amp;id=473769402683697&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://superraregames.com/pages/coming-soon&lt;/ref&gt;.

In comics, Ploog is best known for his work on Marvel Comics' 1970s ''[[Man-Thing]]'' and ''[[Frankenstein's Monster (Marvel Comics)|The Monster of Frankenstein]]'' series, and as the initial artist on the features ''[[Ghost Rider (Johnny Blaze)|Ghost Rider]]'' and ''[[Werewolf by Night]]''. His style at the time was heavily influenced by the art of [[Will Eisner]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.toonopedia.com/werewolf.htm Werewolf by Night] {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/5vcv7Mqs8?url=http://www.toonopedia.com/werewolf.htm |date=2011-01-10 }} at [[Don Markstein's Toonopedia]]: "Ploog, who had previously worked in animation, was unknown in comics when 'Werewolf' started, but quickly made a name for himself in that medium. His artwork was strongly influenced by Will Eisner...."

==Biography==

===Early life and career===
[[File:PSMagazine224.jpg|left|thumb|400px|A typical spread from [[Will Eisner]]'s [[U.S. Army]] publication ''[[PS, The Preventive Maintenance Monthly]]'' #224 (c. 1971), art attributed to Ploog.]]
Born in [[Mankato, Minnesota|Mankato]], [[Minnesota]], Mike Ploog was one of a family of three brothers and a sister&lt;ref name=mm19p6&gt;Ploog, ''Modern Masters Volume Nineteen: Mike Ploog'', p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; raised, initially, on a Minnesota farm.&lt;ref name=mm19p6 /&gt; He began drawing while a young child whose imagination was fired by such [[old-time radio]] dramas as ''[[Sergeant Preston of the Yukon]]'' and ''[[Gunsmoke]]'', and such thriller anthologies as ''[[Inner Sanctum Mysteries]]'' and ''Tales of Horror''.&lt;ref name=mm19p6 /&gt; After his parents divorced and sold the farm when Ploog was about 10 or 11 years old,&lt;ref name=mm19p7&gt;Ploog, ''Modern Masters'', p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; his mother took the children to live with her in [[Burbank, California]].&lt;ref name=mm19p7-8&gt;Ploog, ''Modern Masters'', pp. 7-8&lt;/ref&gt; Ploog entered the [[U.S. Marine Corps]], leaving in 1968, after 10 years.&lt;ref name=mm19p11&gt;Ploog, ''Modern Masters'', p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; Toward the end of his hitch, he began working on the Corps' ''[[Leatherneck Magazine]]'',&lt;ref name=lam&gt;[http://lambiek.net/artists/p/ploog_mike.htm Mike Ploog] at the [[Lambiek]] Comiclopedia. Note: Source erroneously gives Ploog's birthplace as the nearby [[St. Thomas, Minnesota]].&lt;/ref&gt; doing bits of [[writing]], [[photography]] and art.

Around 1969 he began working on Batman and Superman animated TV-series at the Los Angeles studio [[Filmation]], doing what he called "cleanup work for other artists."&lt;ref name="cba2" /&gt; The following season he was promoted to layout work on those' characters' series. "Layout," Ploog recalled in a 1998 interview, "is what happens between [[storyboard]]ing and actual animation; you're literally composing the scenes. You're more or less designing the background, putting the characters into it so they'll look like they're actually walking on the surface".&lt;ref name="cba2"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.twomorrows.com/comicbookartist/articles/02ploog.html |title=The Man Called Ploog |publisher=(Mike Ploog interview) ''[[Comic Book Artist]]'' |issue=2 |date=Summer 1998 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5vHU24LxS?url=http://www.twomorrows.com/comicbookartist/articles/02ploog.html |archivedate=December 27, 2010 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Moving to the [[Hanna-Barbera]] studio the following season, he worked on layouts for the animated series ''[[Motormouse and Autocat]]'' and ''[[Wacky Races (1968 TV series)|Wacky Races]]'', as well as "the first ''[[Scooby-Doo]]'' pilot; nothing spectacular, though. It was okay; it was a salary, y'know? ... I had very few aspirations, because I didn't know where anything I was doing was going to take me".&lt;ref name="cba2" /&gt;

A Hanna-Barbera colleague passed along a flyer he had gotten from writer-artist [[Will Eisner]] seeking an assistant on the military instructional publication ''[[PS, The Preventive Maintenance Monthly]]''. Ploog was familiar with it from his Marine Corps days, and knew well the art, though not the artist's name. "I'd been copying his work for years", Ploog said, "because I was doing visual aids and training aids for the military for a long time".&lt;ref name="cj267"&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5vHUGUkEj?url=http://web.archive.org/web/20080429235441/www.tcj.com/267/i_ploog.html |archivedate=December 27, 2010 |title=Mike Ploog |publisher=(interview), ''[[The Comics Journal]]'' |number=267 |date=April–May 2005 |url=http://www.tcj.com/267/i_ploog.html |deadurl=bot: unknown |df= }} Additional , December 26, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Eisner in 1978 recalled that, "Mike came in working for me in 1967 [sic; Ploog was still in the Marines that year]. I was looking for someone who could work on the ''PS''  magazine ... and Mike sent me his material, or somebody sent it to me, I don't remember which, and I found myself in California, talking Mike into coming to work for us.... We had a very happy relationship for maybe two or three years, four years."&lt;ref name=tcj46p37&gt;"Will Eisner Interview", ''The Comics Journal'' #46 (May 1979), p. 37. Interview conducted Oct. 13 and 17, 1978&lt;/ref&gt;

Ploog moved to [[New York City]] and remained with Eisner for just over two years. As Ploog recalled:
{{blockquote|Will had worked ''PS Magazine'' since about 1952, and [the owners] decided, 'We've got to put it out to somebody else.' You know, it's like he's got this dynasty going. So they said, 'Well, Will, you've got to do something. You've got to either back out of it altogether or find some way of doing this.' So Will came up with the idea: I picked up the contract, and Will became the shadow partner, and I moved across the street from Will's office into another office that he had. I don't know whether he had been leasing it, but we subleased it from Will, and we took over the book. Then it just got to be too much, because it's not that profitable without a partner, but if you've got a partner, then it becomes totally non-profitable.&lt;ref name="cj267" /&gt;}}

===Marvel Comics and Ghost Rider===
Eventually, at the suggestion of Eisner letterer [[Ben Oda]], Ploog broke into comics at [[Warren Publishing]], doing stories for the company's black-and-white [[horror (genre)|horror]]-comics magazines.&lt;ref name=tcj274&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.tcj.com/274/i_ploog.html | publisher = (Online excerpts) ''[[The Comics Journal]]'' | issue = 274 | date= February 2006 | title = Mike Ploog | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060505021214/http://www.tcj.com/274/i_ploog.html | archivedate= May 5, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--He had previously had his first comic story published in the magazine Car-Toons #42 (1968). His then-girlfriend was a model for one of the characters in the story.--&gt; A [[Western comics|Western]] sample he showed Marvel got him a callback to draw ''Werewolf by Night'', which premiered in ''Marvel Spotlight'' #2 (Feb. 1972). As Ploog recalled,
{{quote|Somebody told me I should go to Marvel, so I got up a Western strip, oddly enough, called ''Tin Star''. ... I went over there and they said the work was too cartoony and it wasn't Marvel-style. So I kind of gave up on it, and went back home, and less than a week later they gave me a call. Wanted me to come back in again. That's when I went in and talked to them about doing "Werewolf by Night."&lt;ref name=tcj274 /&gt;}}

After three stories in ''Marvel Spotlight'', the feature spun off onto its own book. Ploog then helped launched the initial, [[Ghost Rider (Johnny Blaze)|Johnny Blaze]] version of the supernatural motorcyclist [[Ghost Rider]], in ''Marvel Spotlight'' #5 (Aug. 1972), and drew the next three adventures.&lt;ref name=gcd&gt;{{gcdb|type=credit|search=Mike+Ploog|title=Mike Ploog}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The specifics of the character's creation are disputed. [[Roy Thomas]], a Marvel writer and the editor-in-chief at the time, recalls, 
{{quote|I had made up a character as a villain in ''[[Daredevil (Marvel Comics series)|Daredevil]]'' — a very lackluster character — called [[Stunt-Master]] ... a motorcyclist. Anyway, when [[Gary Friedrich]] started writing ''Daredevil'', he said, 'Instead of Stunt-Master, I'd like to make the villain a really weird motorcycle-riding character called Ghost Rider'. He didn't describe him. I said, 'Yeah, Gary, there's only one thing wrong with it', and he kind of looked at me weird, because we were old friends from Missouri, and I said, 'That's too good an idea to be just a villain in ''Daredevil''. He should start out right away in his own book'. When Gary wasn't there the day we were going to design it, Mike Ploog, who was going to be the artist, and I designed the character. I had this idea for the skull-head, something like [[Elvis Presley|Elvis]]' ''[[Elvis Presley#1968-1973:Comeback|1968 Special]]'' jumpsuit, and so forth, and Ploog put the fire on the head, just because he thought it looked nice. Gary liked it, so they went off and did it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.twomorrows.com/comicbookartist/articles/13thomas.html |title=Son of Stan: Roy's Years of Horror |publisher=(Roy Thomas interview) ''Comic Book Artist'' |issue=13 |date=May 2001 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5vHVThU3A?url=http://www.twomorrows.com/comicbookartist/articles/13thomas.html |archivedate=December 27, 2010 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Friedrich has responded that,
{{quote|Well, there's some disagreement between Roy, Mike and I over that. I threatened on more than one occasion that if Marvel gets in a position where  they are gonna make a movie or make a lot of money off of it, I'm gonna sue them, and I probably will. ... It was my idea. It was always my idea from the first time we talked about it, it turned out to be a guy with a flaming skull and rode a motorcycle. Ploog seems to think the flaming skull was his idea. But, to tell you the truth, it was ''my'' idea.&lt;ref&gt;Gary Friedrich interview, ''[[Comic Book Artist]]'' #13 (May 2001), p. 84&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Ploog recalled, in a 2008 interview:
{{quote|Now, there's been all kinds of dialog about who was the creator of Ghost Rider. Gary Friedrich was the writer on it. ... The flaming skull: That was the big area of dispute. Who thought of the flaming skull? To be honest with you I can't remember. What else were you going to do with him? You couldn't put a helmet on him, so it had to be a flaming skull. As far as his costume went, it was part of the [[Phantom Rider|old [Western] Ghost Rider]]'s costume, with the Western panel front. The stripes down the arms and the legs were there merely so I could make the character['s costume] as black as I possibly could and still keep track of his body. It was the easiest way to design him.&lt;ref name=mm19p24&gt;Ploog, ''Modern Masters'', pp. 24-25&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Ploog and writer [[Gary Friedrich]] collaborated on the first six issues of Marvel's ''[[Frankenstein's Monster (Marvel Comics)|The Monster of Frankenstein]]'' (Jan.-Oct. 1973), the initial four of which contained a more faithful adaptation of [[Mary Shelley]]'s novel than has mostly appeared elsewhere; comics historian [[Don Markstein]] said, "It was faithful to the story even to the point of leaving the monster trapped in the ice at the end — so of course, the fifth issue began with him being rescued."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.toonopedia.com/franken3.htm Monster of Frankenstein] at Don Markstein's Toonopedia. [https://www.webcitation.org/62hcW8Ckq?url=http://www.toonopedia.com/franken3.htm Archived] October 25, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1989 interview, Ploog said, "I really enjoyed doing ''Frankenstein'' because I related to that naive monster wandering around a world he had no knowledge of — an outsider seeing everything through the eyes of a child."&lt;ref name="cba2" /&gt; The following year, Ploog teamed with  writer [[Steve Gerber]] on ''[[Man-Thing]]'' #5-11 (May-Nov. 1974),&lt;ref name=gcd /&gt; [[penciler|penciling]] a critically acclaimed series of stories involving a dead clown, psychic paralysis in the face of modern society, and other topics far removed from the usual fare of comics of the time, with Ploog's cute-but-creepy art style setting off Gerber's trademark intellectual surrealism.

Ploog's other regular titles at Marvel were ''[[Planet of the Apes (comics)|Planet of the Apes]]'', ''[[Kull of Atlantis|Kull the Destroyer]]'' and the series ''[[Werewolf by Night]]''. Ploog also drew the [[Don McGregor]] story "The Reality Manipulators" in the black-and-white comics magazine ''[[Marvel Preview]]'' #8 (Fall 1976), and the [[Doug Moench]] feature "[[Weirdworld]]" in the color comic ''[[Marvel Premiere]]'' #38 (Oct. 1977), among other items.&lt;ref name=gcd /&gt;

He left Marvel following what he describes as "a disagreement with [[Jim Shooter]]. I had moved to a farm in [[Minnesota]], and agreed to do a hand-colored 'Weirdworld' story. Marvel backed out of the deal after I had started. I can't remember the details, but it doesn't matter. I think I was ready to move on."&lt;ref name = tcj44&gt;{{cite news | title = Ploog &amp; Kirby Quit Marvel over Contract Dispute | work= [[The Comics Journal]] | issue = 44 | date = January 1979 | page = 11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marvel and I were both changing. I finished off a black-and-white Kull book that was my last comic for many years."&lt;ref name="cba2" /&gt; Richard Marschall, editor of what was to be a 60-page "Weirdworld" by Ploog and writer Moench for one of the ''[[Marvel Super Special]]'' series of [[one-shot (comics)|one-shots]], said at the time that Ploog had been given four months to complete the art, and when it became evident the deadline would not be met, arranged to publish the story in two 30-page installments, giving Ploog two more months. Ploog sent Marvel [[photocopies]] of the first 31 pages, and was paid for them. During this time, Marvel had given [[work-for-hire]] contracts to its freelancers, many of whom, including Ploog, [[Frank Brunner]], [[Jack Kirby]], [[Don McGregor]], [[Roger Slifer]], and [[Roger Stern]], refused to sign, resulting in cessation of work for Marvel. Ploog "took himself off the project," said Marschall, and retained his original artwork.&lt;ref name = tcj44 /&gt; Moench's script was eventually published as a 106-page story illustrated by penciler [[John Buscema]], inker [[Rudy Nebres]], and [[airbrush]] colorist [[Peter Ledger]] as the three-part "Warriors of the Shadow Realm" in ''[[Marvel Super Special]]'' #11-13 (Spring - Fall 1979).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comics.org/issue/33292/ ''Marvel Comics Super Special'' #11], [http://www.comics.org/issue/33527/ #12], and [http://www.comics.org/issue/33767/ #13] at the [[Grand Comics Database]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Marginalia includes some work for ''[[Heavy Metal (magazine)|Heavy Metal]]'' magazine in 1981, and three "Luke Malone, Manhunter" backup features in the [[Atlas/Seaboard]] title ''Police Action'' #1-3 (Feb., April, June 1975), the first of which he also scripted.&lt;ref name=gcd /&gt;

===Later career===
Ploog returned to the [[movie industry]]. By his account, he has worked in post-production on the movie ''[[Ghostbusters]]'' ("All that stuff you saw on cereal boxes are my paintings")&lt;ref name="cba2" /&gt; and with film director [[Ralph Bakshi]] on the animated features ''[[Wizards (film)|Wizards]]'',&lt;ref name=mm19p36&gt;Ploog, ''Modern Masters'', pp. 36, 40-42&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|The Lord of the Rings]]'',&lt;ref name=mm19p36 /&gt; and ''[[Hey Good Lookin' (film)|Hey Good Lookin']].'' He was production designer on ''[[Michael Jackson: Moonwalker]]'' (1988),&lt;ref name=mm19p54&gt;Ploog, ''Modern Masters'', p. 54&lt;/ref&gt; and has storyboarded or done other design work on films including John Carpenter's ''[[The Thing (1982 film)|The Thing]]'',&lt;ref name=mm19p43&gt;Ploog, ''Modern Masters'', pp. 43, 45&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Superman II]]'',&lt;ref name=mm19p44&gt;Ploog, ''Modern Masters'', pp. 44-45&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Little Shop of Horrors (film)|Little Shop of Horrors]]''&lt;ref name=mm19p47&gt;Ploog, ''Modern Masters'', p. 47&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[The Unbearable Lightness of Being (film)|The Unbearable Lightness of Being]]'', and, he says, several [[Jim Henson Company]] projects, such as the films ''[[The Dark Crystal]]''&lt;ref name=mm19p47 /&gt; and ''[[Labyrinth (film)|Labyrinth]]'' and the TV series ''[[The Storyteller]].''&lt;ref name=mm19p49&gt;Ploog, ''Modern Masters'', p. 49&lt;/ref&gt;

Between movies, Ploog illustrated ''[[L. Frank Baum]]'s the Life and Adventures of [[Santa Claus]]'' (1992; {{ISBN|0-7567-6682-6}}), a [[graphic novel]] adapting ''[[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz]]'' creator's 1902 novella.

With old colleague Steve Gerber, Ploog drew the [[Malibu Comics]] one-shot ''Sludge: Red X-Mas'' (Dec. 1994), but otherwise remained away from comics for another decade before teaming with veteran writer [[J.M. DeMatteis]] on the [[CrossGen]] [[fantasy]] ''[[Abadazad]]'' (May 2004).&lt;ref name=gcd /&gt;

Ploog has illustrated cards for the ''[[Magic: The Gathering]]'' collectible card game.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?page=0&amp;action=advanced&amp;artist=%5B%22Mike%20Ploog%22%5D Mike Ploog entry] at Gatherer: Magic Card Database.

'''''Ojos azules''''' is a traditional [[huayño|huayno|taquirari]] song of the Andean region, authored by the bolivian composer from Oruro, Gilberto Rojas in 1947. This song is very popular in Bolivia, Peru, Northern Chile and Argentina. The Bolivian song with a taquirari rythm, "Ojos Azules", became well known in the Andean region when the famous Argentinian singer, Mercedes Sossa, recorded her version in the 1960s. The song was also recorded by Los Panchos from Mexico.  Both Mercedes Sossa and Los Panchos recognized the bolivian Gilberto Rojas as the author of "Ojos Azules". A blogspot, sentimientoandinolatam, erroneously attributes the song to the peruvian Manuel Casazola Huanco. Nothing is known about Huanco except that he was born in Cuzco. &lt;https://elfulgor.com/noticia/228/gilberto-rojas-el-orureno&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3577">'''PLEX''', or Prairie Lindy Exchange, is an acronym used in various [[lindy exchange]]s in central North America.  Historically, PLEXes are smaller than most lindy exchanges.  Unlike most lindy exchanges, the hosting city may be different each successive PLEX.

PLEXes usually take place over a weekend.  [[Lindy bombing]], live band dances, and a few workshops are typical events scheduled during an exchange.  Rates are typically very inexpensive.

'''Pro-Line Racing''' is a manufacturer of [[wheel]]s, [[tire]]s, accessories and bodies for 1/10-scale on- and offroad [[radio-controlled car]]s.

The company was founded in 1983 in [[Beaumont, California]], United States and is headquartered there. It quickly established a name for itself as a producer of quality products by capturing seven offroad national championships in 1992.

In 1993, tires swept both the 2WD and the 4WD classes at the [[IFMAR 1:10 Electric Off-Road World Championship|IFMAR Offroad Championships]], the company's second and third World Championship titles. 1995 saw Pro-Line win its fourth and fifth IFMAR World Championships at Japan's [[Yatabe Arena]].

That same year, Pro-Line Racing purchased independent body manufacturer PROTOform Race Bodies, retaining founder Dale Epp to expand the company's market share. That partnership continues today and has placed Pro-Line Racing near the very top of the R/C body market.

Their marketing strategy has expanded in recent years to include PLUGZ, a series of custom Class II and Class III trailer hitch receiver covers for full-sized vehicles as well as So Real 1/24-scale diecast static car models.

'''''Pure Pwnage''''' (pronounced "pure ownage")&lt;ref name="pwn"&gt;The word "pwnage" can be pronounced several different ways. The show's creators pronounce it "ownage". Jeremy justifies this pronunciation with the following statements: "When people say [[Pwn|{{IPA|/ˈpoʊn/}}]], they sound like a complete fag, and I'm not cool with being a fag, so I pronounce it {{IPA|/ˈoʊn/}}." {{" '}}Pwn' was originally a typo of 'own', because the 'P' is near the 'O' on the keyboard. The person is still trying to say 'own'." [TeamSpeak chat, December 13, 2005].&lt;/ref&gt;
was a Canadian [[web series|Internet-distributed]], [[mockumentary]] series from ROFLMAO Productions.  The fictional series purports to chronicle the life and adventures of Jeremy (played by Jarett Cale), a [[Canadians|Canadian]] and self-proclaimed "[[pro gamer]]".  In 2010, an adaptation of the web series began airing on [[Showcase (Canadian TV channel)|Showcase]], a [[Television in Canada|Canadian]] [[cable television]] [[specialty channel|channel]], but the series failed to be picked up for a second season.

== Premise ==
Jeremy (played by Jarett Cale) also known as "teh_pwnerer" is extremely proficient at [[video games]] but inexperienced when it comes to [[Norm (sociology)|normal social interactions]].  Jeremy is only interested in "[[pwn]]ing [[noob|n00bs]]" and making it as a [[pro gamer]] and often comes off as lazy and narcissistic to other people.  Kyle (played by Geoff Lapaire) is Jeremy's brother and an aspiring film-maker.  Kyle decides to film a documentary of Jeremy's exploits as a [[gamer]] and his interactions with the gaming and non-gaming world. In 2012, it was announced that the crew are making a Pure Pwnage film with funding by their fans.

== History ==
''Pure Pwnage'' was created by Geoff Lapaire and Jarett Cale who also play the show's main protagonists.  Originating in 2004, eighteen Internet-distributed episodes of the series have been released to date. In 2007, the series creators estimated their current viewer base to be over three million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = The Infancy of Internet Television | author = Geoff Lapaire | publisher = Pure Pwnage | url = http://www.purepwnage.com/index.php?GUID=19150 | accessdate = 2007-11-17 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071215065150/http://www.purepwnage.com/index.php?GUID=19150 | archivedate = 2007-12-15 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The series is filmed primarily in [[Toronto]], Ontario, but has also included scenes filmed in [[Calgary]], Alberta; [[Montreal]], Quebec; [[Aurora, Ontario]]; [[Hamilton, Ontario]]; and the [[Netherlands]].

During an interview, director Geoff Lapaire (although as "Kyle"; Lapaire maintained his "Kyle" identity among fans and media) insisted that all of the characters on the show are not acting.&lt;ref name="teamspeak"&gt;Starting with Episode 8, the ''Pure Pwnage'' cast and crew hold a public [[TeamSpeak]] interview soon after the release of each episode, revealing many details about the show and the personalities involved in its creation. The recordings of each episode are linked in a [http://www.purepwnage.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=54783 post] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927010003/http://www.purepwnage.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=54783 |date=2007-09-27 }} on the forums.&lt;/ref&gt; He suggested that the personalities on ''Pure Pwnage'' display their true-to-life abilities and eccentricities, and the characters took great pains to maintain that the ''Pure Pwnage'' world is simply an extension of the real world. Lapaire has finally admitted that they are in fact actors. The sixth fanchat with the crew was out-of-character, where the fact that the characters within ''Pure Pwnage'' are exaggerated versions of the actors was confirmed.

On August 6, 2009, it was announced that a ''Pure Pwnage'' TV series had been commissioned by [[Showcase (Canadian TV channel)|Showcase]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tV6cjKxZFOM&lt;/ref&gt;  Upon the announcement, many members of the ''Pure Pwnage'' fan community raised concerns. The main complaints were that the series was only announced to be airing in Canada, and the assumption that it would be changed in order to appeal to viewers not familiar with [[internet culture]]. Jarett Cale, who writes the show and plays Jeremy, tried to quell the complaints on the ''Pure Pwnage'' forums, saying "We're doing our best to get it broadcast in the USA, UK, Australia, etc., but it's really up to each country's respective broadcasters. ''[...]'' Geoff and I are still the main creative force&amp;nbsp;– we're producers and writers. We've also brought on many new people with experience in traditional television to help us out both story-wise and production-wise. FPS Doug will still be there, and he will still be played by Joel Gardiner."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.purepwnage.com/forums/index.php?s=&amp;showtopic=92459&amp;view=findpost&amp;p=1770140 |title=''Pure Pwnage'' forum post |last=Cale |first=Jarett |date=2009-08-06 |publisher=ROFLMAO Productions |accessdate=2009-08-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100616054549/http://purepwnage.com/forums/index.php?s= |archivedate=June 16, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to a user asking if the TV series meant there would be no more web episodes, he said "Nope, it only means there's a new TV series."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.purepwnage.com/forums/index.php?s=&amp;showtopic=92541&amp;view=findpost&amp;p=1772872 |title=''Pure Pwnage'' forum post |last=Cale |first=Jarett |date=2008-08-10 |publisher=ROFLMAO Productions |accessdate=2009-08-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100616054549/http://purepwnage.com/forums/index.php?s= |archivedate=June 16, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite this, the future of the web series was uncertain. Geoff Lapaire, director of all previous episodes of ''Pure Pwnage'', left the show in September 2008 to focus on the then-unannounced TV series, and Troy Dixon, who played T-Bag in the series, died in a car accident on December 6, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.purepwnage.com/forums/index.php?s=&amp;showtopic=84552&amp;view=findpost&amp;p=1600457 |title=''Pure Pwnage'' forum post |date=2008-12-09 |publisher=ROFLMAO Productions |accessdate=2009-08-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100616054549/http://purepwnage.com/forums/index.php?s= |archivedate=June 16, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Jarett Cale announced in January 2009 that work on the next web episode had begun, with him as the director, however the episode has not been released.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.purepwnage.com/index.php?GUID=86392 |title=''Pure Pwnage'' news post |last=Cale |first=Jarett |date=2009-01-27 |publisher=ROFLMAO Productions |accessdate=2009-08-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090720025702/http://www.purepwnage.com/index.php?GUID=86392 |archivedate=July 20, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a short Livestream cast on March 15, 2010, a user posted a comment regarding the web series and Jarett replied that the web series is back in production and is in progress. He has not given out an ETA.

On January 19, 2011, Jarett made an announcement on the Pure Pwnage forums that the TV series had not been picked up for a second season. Additionally, the web series has been put on indefinite hold. In his own words, "My hope that Pure Pwnage will see a proper ending to its illustrious web series has nearly vanished. I've let Geoff know that should he be willing at any time to resume some of his traditional, critical roles on the web series I will fly home to Toronto in a heartbeat to help make it happen."

On September 18, 2012 The Pure Pwnage YouTube channel uploaded a video titled "010100100100010101010100010101010101001001001110" which is a binary encoding of the word "Return", signalling the return of the Pure Pwnage.

==Pure Pwnage Teh Movie==
On September 19, 2012, an official [[crowd funding]] campaign was announced to aid in the funding of a Pure Pwnage movie.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.indiegogo.com/purepwnage&lt;/ref&gt; The $75,000 goal was raised in just over 24 hours, due to overwhelming support from fans all over the world. At the end of the campaign, a total of $211,300 was raised.

On November 22, 2015, the official trailer was released. The movie premiered in Toronto on January 23, 2016 at the Bloor Cinema. Further screenings took place around the US and in the UK.

On May 7, 2016, Pure Pwnage Teh Movie was released for streaming and digital download via Vimeo.

=== Reception and awards ===
Pure Pwnage Teh Movie received the Canadian Comedy Awards 2016 award for best feature film.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://canadiancomedyawards.org/awards.php|title=Awards {{!}} Canadian Comedy Awards|website=canadiancomedyawards.org|access-date=2016-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was well-received by general audiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Lapaire|first=Geoff|title=Pure Pwnage|date=2016-02-03|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4682866/|accessdate=2016-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Spin-offs ==

=== TV series ===
On August 6, 2009, it was announced that a ''Pure Pwnage'' TV series had been commissioned by [[Showcase (Canadian TV channel)|Showcase]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.purepwnage.com/index.php?GUID=92459|title=Pure Pwnage announcement: "Project X Revealed"|publisher=ROFLMAO Productions|accessdate=2009-08-16|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090811220757/http://www.purepwnage.com/index.php?GUID=92459|archivedate=2009-08-11|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The announcement was made in the form of a mini-episode where Kyle tries to convince Jeremy to stop playing on his [[Nintendo DS Lite]] and make the announcement. The series had been teased for several months under the name "Project X". The TV series premiered on [[Showcase (Canadian TV channel)|Showcase]] March 12, 2010, and premiered on Australia's [[ABC2]] on October 4, 2010. According to creator Jarett Cale, the TV series itself takes place in a fictional world within the Pure Pwnage universe (webseries) where Kyle ironically got a TV series, thus explaining the lack of consistency between shows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/tv/guide/abc2/201010/programs/ZX1389A001D2010-10-04T210600.htm?program=Pure%20Pwnage|title=Pure Pwnage - Life Of A Pro Gamer|accessdate=2010-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Jeremy's Mail Sac ===
Starting in March 2010, the ''Pure Pwnage'' website began letting fans send Jeremy questions via e-mail.  Jeremy then answered the fan questions in video segments posted on the website titled, ''Jeremy's Mail Sac''.

=== Pro at Cooking ===
{{Main|Pro at Cooking}}
Starring Dave (Dawei) as himself, ''Pro at Cooking'' is a spin-off of ''Pure Pwnage''. A cooking show for gamers with Dave hosting as the main chef. When his female assistants do not perform as expected, Dave constantly fires each one of them usually after every episode. Directed by Davin, it has only aired seven 5- to 10-minute episodes. No other characters from ''Pure Pwnage'', excluding Dave, Davin, and Geoff, appear on the show.

=== ''Pure Pwnage: The Comic'' ===
From February 28, 2006 to March 7, 2007, the ''Pure Pwnage'' website featured a regularly issued comic, of which a new page was released once every two to three weeks. Apparently set in the "real world" rather than in the fictional world of ''Pure Pwnage'', the comic breaks most of the [[fourth wall]] of the show. For example, Dave said in the show that he was leaving it due to unfinished business in China, the comic claims that the real reason was that he had found a new job in [[Vancouver]].

However, both the show and comic clearly contain elements that are either symbolic representations of reality (for example, [[pwn]]ing an opponent with "micro balls" as a possible metaphor for pwning them in an actual video game) or are not based in reality whatsoever.

=== Pure Pwnage: Teh Movie ===
In September 2012, series creators Jarett Cale and Geoff Lapaire announced an indiegogo campaign to raise funds for a Pure Pwnage feature-length film. Within 24 hours of the campaign being launched, the project had received their goal of $75,000, and by the end of the campaign, they had reached a total of $211,300. Despite this being a relatively small film budget, Jarett Cale and Geoff Lapaire have said that with their experience of making the web series with an extremely limited amount of funds, they are confident that they would be able to make a quality film shot in countries across the world, mentioning hopes of filming in South Korea. Pre-production began in earnest in early 2013, with weekly twitch.tv livestreams in which Lapaire, Cale, and guests such as Joel Gardiner (fps_doug) and Miranda Plant (Tagi) discuss the film and interact with fans.

The film premiered on January 23, 2016, in Toronto, Ontario. Following this, Cale and Lapaire took the film to the road, screening the project around the world in a touring limited release.

On May 7, 2016, Pure Pwnage Teh Movie was released for streaming and digital download on Vimeo.

'''Reinald Werrenrath''' (August 7, 1883 &amp;ndash; September 12, 1953) was an [[United States|American]] [[baritone]] [[opera]] singer, who also recorded [[popular music|popular songs]] and appeared regularly on [[radio]] in the early decades of the twentieth century.&lt;ref name=findagrave/&gt;

==Biography==
He was born in [[Brooklyn, New York]], the son of George Werrenrath, an operatic [[tenor]] born in [[Denmark]]. He studied at [[New York University]], and made his operatic debut in 1907 in ''[[Die Meistersinger]]''.  He also recorded for [[Edison Records]] in 1907, before a long recording career with the [[Victor Talking Machine Company]].  He sang on several hundred Victor recordings between 1906 and 1929, both as a soloist and as part of various vocal ensembles such as the Orpheus Quartet and the Victor Opera Quartet.&lt;ref name="whitburn memories"/&gt;&lt;ref name=jukebox&gt;[https://www.loc.gov/jukebox/artists/detail/id/1151/ Library of Congress: National Jukebox]. Retrieved 15 May 2013&lt;/ref&gt;  His most commercially successful recordings included "As Long As The World Rolls On" (1907), "Hello Frisco!" (from ''"[[Ziegfeld Follies]] of 1915"''), and "[[Smilin' Through (song)|Smilin' Through]]" (1919).&lt;ref name="whitburn memories"&gt;{{cite book| last1 = Whitburn | first1 = Joel| title = Pop Memories 1890-1954: The History of American Popular Music| location = Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin| publisher = Record Research, Inc. | year= 1986| pages = 445| isbn = 0-89820-083-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Werrenrath made his debut at the [[Metropolitan Opera]] in 1919, in ''[[Pagliacci]]'', in a cast that also included [[Enrico Caruso]].&lt;ref name=findagrave/&gt;  He also toured widely, and made over 3,000 concert appearances.&lt;ref name="whitburn memories"/&gt;  He was one of the first singing stars to appear regularly on [[radio]], notably on radio station [[WNBC (AM)|WEAF]] in New York.  In 1930, he made a private recording of [[Christmas]] greetings accompanied by [[Harpo Marx]] and others.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nationaleducationsolutions.com/2012/02/20/alexander-woollcott-harpo-marx-reinald-werrenrath-1930/  National Education Solutions: Alexander Woollcott, Harpo Marx, Reinald Werrenrath] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130706012858/http://nationaleducationsolutions.com/2012/02/20/alexander-woollcott-harpo-marx-reinald-werrenrath-1930/ |date=2013-07-06 }}. Retrieved 15 May 2013&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1932, he became a member of [[NBC]]'s music staff, and in later years devoted himself mainly to teaching, at the [[Peabody Conservatory]] in [[Baltimore, Maryland]] and elsewhere.&lt;ref name=jukebox/&gt; He also ran a regular summer music school at [[Dannemora (town), New York|Chazy Lake, New York]].&lt;ref name=findagrave/&gt;

He was married three times.  He died on September 12, 1953 in [[Plattsburgh, New York]], after suffering a [[heart attack]] while at Chazy Lake.&lt;ref name=findagrave&gt;{{cite news |author= |coauthors= |title=Werrenrath Dies; Radio Singing Star.

'''''Saturday Night at the Movies''''' was a weekly [[television]] series on [[TVOntario]], the public educational television network in [[Ontario]], [[Canada]].&lt;ref&gt;"TVO's Saturday Night transcended the eras". ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'', November 15, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The series presented classic [[film|movies]], followed by interviews and feature segments with [[film director|directors]], [[actor]]s and other people involved in making the films presented.&lt;ref name=remembering&gt;"Remembering nearly 40 years of Saturday Night at the Movies: As the series' last broadcast draws near, former hosts and staff share memories". ''[[Toronto Star]]'', August 29, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The show was initially formatted in this way due to requirements that all programming shown on TVO (including dramatic programming) needed to contain educational elements, which was usually accomplished by including interviews and analysis of the programming. Nevertheless, even after these requirements were dropped, the format was maintained; all told, the series presented almost 1,500 films and over 1,000 interviews.

The show was produced for much of its run by Risa Shuman.&lt;ref name=ouzonian&gt;Richard Ouzonian, [https://www.thestar.com/entertainment/2011/07/24/ouzounian_the_secret_to_elwy_yosts_success.html "The secret to Elwy Yost’s success"]. ''[[Toronto Star]]'', July 24, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Broadcast history==

===Elwy Yost era===
First aired on March 30, 1974, the program was originally hosted by [[Elwy Yost]]. The first film shown was [[Ingmar Bergman]]'s ''[[Through a Glass Darkly (film)|Through a Glass Darkly]]''.&lt;ref name=remembering/&gt; During Yost's 25-year tenure as host, he showed a variety of foreign films, but tended to concentrate on Hollywood-produced films from the 1930s through the 1950s, slowly expanding into also showing films from the 1960s and 1970s as the series progressed. For a number of years, however, the show was not able to broadcast films from the [[Warner Bros.]] studio, as TVOntario's transmitter in [[Windsor, Ontario|Windsor]] created a programming rights conflict with stations in [[Detroit]].&lt;ref name=revamp&gt;"TVO prepares for a revamp ; But so far no host to replace Elwy Yost". ''[[Toronto Star]]'', July 19, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his final decade hosting the show, Yost lived in [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]], and would travel to Toronto to prepare many episodes of the show at once.&lt;ref name=ouzonian/&gt;

Yost retired as host of the series in 1999.&lt;ref name=changing&gt;Changing faces: Taking over Elwy Yost's host job bittersweet for Shelagh Rogers". ''[[Waterloo Region Record]]'', October 9, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; The last film he presented was, atypically, a recent Hollywood blockbuster: ''[[Speed (1994 film)|Speed]]'' was personally chosen by Yost to conclude his run as host, as it was written by his son, screenwriter [[Graham Yost]].&lt;ref name=changing/&gt; Around the same time as his retirement, he was inducted into the [[Order of Canada]].&lt;ref&gt;"Munsch, Yost, Egoyan named to Order". ''[[Welland Tribune]]'', July 8, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

===After Yost===
Soon after Yost's retirement, the [[Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario|Progressive Conservative]] government of [[Mike Harris]] appointed [[Isabel Bassett]] as chair of TVOntario, with a mandate to refocus the network's broadcast schedule more clearly on education.&lt;ref&gt;"Isabel Bassett, the made-for-TV mover: The former culture minister is getting high marks in her tough new assignment at TVO". ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'', May 9, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; Although there was some concern that the network would lose ''Saturday Night at the Movies'', its highest-rated program,&lt;ref&gt;"Isabel Bassett 'delighted' to be named TVO head ; Former culture minister to put focus back on education". ''[[Toronto Star]]'', November 19, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; Bassett instead negotiated an agreement with [[York University]] to include the series in its [[film studies]] curriculum.&lt;ref&gt;"Elwy 101: TVO and York collaborate on film studies". ''[[Guelph Mercury]]'', February 21, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

Yost was replaced as host for one season by [[Shelagh Rogers]], concurrently with her continuing role as host of [[CBC Music|CBC Stereo]]'s classical music program ''Take Five''.&lt;ref name=changing/&gt; When Rogers became the host of CBC Radio's morning news program ''[[This Morning (radio program)|This Morning]]'' in 2000, she left ''Saturday Night at the Movies'', which briefly changed to a hostless format.&lt;ref&gt;"Saturday Night at the Movies goes hostless". ''[[Ottawa Citizen]]'', September 29, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; At this time, the series added a Sunday night companion series, ''Sunday Night at the Cinema'', which focused more on international film.&lt;ref name=revamp/&gt;

The program was then hosted by [[Johanna Schneller]] for two seasons beginning in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;"Intelligence quotient". ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'', September 18, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; The show's final host, for the remainder of its run, was Thom Ernst.&lt;ref name=curtain&gt;"Curtain prepares to close on TV show: Saturday Night at the Movies wraps up on TVO after 39 years". ''[[Toronto Star]]'', August 23, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 13, 2012, it was announced that TVO would cancel ''Saturday Night at the Movies'' as of the end of the 2012-2013 season, amidst budget cuts incurred by the network.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newswire.ca/en/story/1069963/tvo-announces-plan-that-looks-to-future "TVO Announces Plan That Looks to Future"]. ''[[Canada Newswire]]'', November 13, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The final edition of ''Saturday Night at the Movies'' was broadcast on August 31, 2013, featuring two foreign films as its last movies: ''[[The Lives of Others]]'' (at 8 P.M.), and ''[[Black Book (film)|Black Book]]'' (starting at 10:50 P.M.) &lt;ref&gt;Peter Howell, [https://www.thestar.com/entertainment/movies/2013/08/23/saturday_night_at_the_movies_when_going_to_the_movies_meant_staying_in_howell.html "Saturday Night at the Movies, when going to the movies meant staying in"].

'''Space pirates''' are a type of [[stock character]] from [[science fiction]].&lt;ref name="greenwood"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Westfahl |first=Gary |authorlink=Gary Westfahl |date=September 30, 2005 |title=The Greenwood Encyclopedia of Science Fiction and Fantasy: Themes, Works and Wonders |volume=2 |publisher=[[Greenwood Publishing Group|Greenwood Press]] |via=Google Books |isbn=0-313-32950-8 |pages=600–601 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3JXnz9x9sO4C&amp;pg=PA600&amp;lpg=PA600&amp;dq=space+pirates+fiction&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ttKk_6ZLaY&amp;sig=nS4wwirlq_u4tl-Qeiz2gm0VO8s&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=tMGMVd7QHomvyAS4oauIAw&amp;ved=0CGkQ6AEwDw#v=onepage&amp;q=space%20pirates%20fiction&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
Space pirates operate as [[piracy|pirates]] in [[outer space]] and travel by [[spacecraft]], as opposed to the more traditional pirates on the high seas of [[Earth]], who travel by [[ship]].&lt;ref name="greenwood"/&gt; However, just as traditional seafaring pirates target [[sailing ships]], space pirates serve a similar role in sci-fi media: they capture and plunder spacecraft for cargo, loot and occasionally they steal the entire spacecraft itself, and kill or enslave the crewmembers and any passengers found.&lt;ref name="greenwood"/&gt; However, their dress and speech may vary; it may correspond to the particular author's vision of the future, rather than their seafaring precursors. On the other hand, space pirates may be modeled after stereotypical sea pirates. They may be humans who originate from Earth, or a specific race of aliens. Space pirates are common in [[space opera]] and soft [[science fiction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://futurewarstories.blogspot.se/2013/03/fws-topics-space-pirates.html|title=Future War Stories|publisher=English|language=English|author=William|date=12 March 2013|accessdate=15 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Stacey Roy''' (born February 9) is a Canadian [[actor]], [[Film producer|producer]], [[Talk show host|host]], live broadcaster and [[content creator]]. She runs Whabam Media with her partner Mike Parkerson.&lt;ref name="Whabam Media About"&gt;{{cite web|title=Whabam About Page|url=http://www.whabammedia.com/about|website=Whabam Media|accessdate=20 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Konami Interview"&gt;{{cite web|title=Konami Interview with Stacey Roy|url=http://uk-blog.konami-europe.com/2014/11/11/whabams-silent-hill-fan-film|website=Konami Blog UK|publisher=Konami|accessdate=20 April 2017|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151006212340/http://uk-blog.konami-europe.com/2014/11/11/whabams-silent-hill-fan-film|archivedate=6 October 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Roy was born in [[Banff, Alberta]], Canada to Teresa and Kurtis Roy. She was crowned Miss Teen Red Deer and Miss Teen Calgary in 2005.&lt;ref name="Strathmore Standard"&gt;{{cite news|title=Strathmore Girl Crowned|url=http://www.strathmorestandard.com/2005/04/21/strathmore-girl-crowned|accessdate=20 April 2017|publisher=Strathmore Standard|date=April 21, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; She later moved to [[Vancouver, British Columbia]] where she graduated from [[Vancouver Film School]] in Acting for Film and Television.&lt;ref name="Konami Interview" /&gt;

==Career==
Roy's screen debut was in 2010 with the role of Jane in [[30 Days of Night: Dark Days]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=30 Days of Night: Dark Days (2010 Video) Full Cast &amp; Crew|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1320304/fullcredits?ref_=tt_cl_sm#cast|website=IMDB|accessdate=10 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 2010 and 2012, she acted and auditioned for several roles while learning the art of bartending at Uva Wine Bar, which inspired her first show, The Nerdy Bartender.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

Roy met Mike Parkerson in 2012 and they created a film production company called Whabam Media.&lt;ref name="Whabam Media About" /&gt;  In 2013, she designed her costume for her second fan film ''[[Starcraft]]: Hunt for Kerrigan'', which was nominated for Best Action Short at the Geeksboro Film Fest in 2015.&lt;ref name="Konami Interview" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Geekboro"&gt;{{cite news|title=Geekboro Film Festival|url=http://www.thetimesnews.com/20150402/fan-film-fest-set-for-may-1-7/304029861|accessdate=20 April 2017|agency=Gatehouse Media|publisher=The Times News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Roy's first [[cosplay]] convention was in 2013 at Vancouver Anime Revolution where she dressed as Princess Daisy from her [[Smash Bros]] fan film. Her next short film, [[Silent Hill]], was inspired by the [[P.T trailer]] released in 2014.&lt;ref name="Konami Interview" /&gt; Shortly after release, she was interviewed by [[Konami]] where she revealed her other company Vancosplay Photography which she ran with Ryan Cooper&lt;ref name="Konami Interview" /&gt; Vancosplay focused on high quality composites rather than typical convention photography but closed in 2016.&lt;ref name="Vancosplay"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cooper|first1=Ryan|title=Vancosplay Photography|url=http://vancosplay.com/|website=Vancosplay Photography|accessdate=20 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, Whabam Media released the trailer for [[Overwatch (video game)|Overwatch]] Legacy.  Roy submitted the video for the [[Blizzcon]] Video Contest but it didn’t place. It did gain attention from [[IGN]]&lt;ref name="7 OW"&gt;{{cite web|title=7 OVERWATCH COSPLAYERS YOU NEED TO SEE - IGN ACCESS|url=http://ca.ign.com/videos/2015/11/08/7-overwatch-cosplayers-you-need-to-see-ign-access|website=IGN|accessdate=20 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Kotaku]] for her cosplay as Tracer and she was named one of the top cosplayers alongside [[Jessica Nigri]], by IGN.&lt;ref name="7 OW"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kotaku"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Vas|first1=Gergo|title=People Are Already Making Overwatch Fan-Movies|url=http://kotaku.com/people-are-already-making-overwatch-fan-movies-1719919813|website=Kotaku|accessdate=20 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Macy|first1=Seth|title=8 AWESOME COSPLAYERS AND THEIR AMAZING WORK|url=http://in.ign.com/metal-gear-solid-5/88304/feature/8-awesome-cosplayers-and-their-amazing-work|website=IGN|accessdate=20 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, co-hosted episode 150 of The Attack with Alex Corea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Attack (2015– ) Full Cast &amp; Crew|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6127996/fullcredits?ref_=tt_cl_sm#cast|website=IMDB|accessdate=17 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 2014 and 2015, Roy worked with YouTubers IFHT both in acting and producing capacities. The videos include How to be a DJ, How to be a Filmmaker and Bad Ways to Get Rid of Your Girlfriend.  She also worked with YouTubers [[Film Riot]] shooting behind the scenes for a series of [[DJI (company)|DJI]] commercials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Maher|first1=Michael|title=DJI and Film Riot Launch an Online Film School|url=https://www.premiumbeat.com/blog/dji-film-riot-launch-online-film-school/|website=Premium Beat|accessdate=20 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in 2015, Roy played [[Harley Quinn]] in the [[Leo Award]] nominated fan film Nightwing: The Darkest Knight directed by Matthew Campbell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Nominees for Best Cinematography in a Short Drama|url=http://www.leoawards.com/2016/nominees/by_name.php#Short_Drama-Cinematography|website=Leo Awards|accessdate=20 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her work with the character was praised.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Review: NIGHTWING: THE DARKEST KNIGHT|url=http://www.mercwithamovieblog.com/2016/01/review-nightwing-darkest-knight.html|website=Merc with a Movie Blog|accessdate=20 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=3 EPIC VANCOUVER-MADE FAN-FILMS|url=https://604now.com/3-epic-vancouver-made-fan-films/|website=604 Now|accessdate=20 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, Roy began to switch from [[YouTube]] to [[Twitch.tv|Twitch]]. She launched several shows on the channel such as The Nerdy Bartender (a talk show featuring special guests and thematic crafted drinks), Heads Up (a [[Virtual Reality]] talk show with industry guests and gameplay interaction), Table of Terror (a seasonal, tabletop [[Dungeons and Dragons]] experience with recurring guests), Winesday Gaming (a more traditional gaming show), “Cooking” with Stacey (a competition show with a different ingredient or theme each week) and The Stacey Roy Podcast.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

In 2016, Roy and Parkerson transformed their garage into a studio called the Whabam Studio.&lt;ref name="Whabam Studios"&gt;{{cite web|title=WHABAM.tv Studio|url=http://whabammedia.com/WhabamStudio|website=WHABAM.tv|accessdate=20 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The technical multicam setup consists of [[Blackmagic Design]] cameras, wireless lavalier mics, color changing bulbs, and diffused box lighting and teleprompters.  Each set wall is magnetic and designed to be easily swappable so the studio can be modified to suit the individual needs of each show. The construction of the studio was live streamed and much of the cost was covered by her fans.&lt;ref name="Whabam Studios" /&gt;

Roy has worked with charities since 2005 including the [[Leo Club]], Students Against Drunk Driving, [[the Chive]], and Operation Supply Drop.&lt;ref name="Strathmore Standard" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=OSDTV Podcast with Filthy Casual, Darshelle and Stacey Roy|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OYH37e9c7U|website=YouTube|publisher=Operation Supply Drop|accessdate=20 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Stefan Kramer Solís''' (born 19 February 1982 in [[Santiago]]) is a [[Chilean people|Chilean]] [[impressionist (entertainment)|impressionist]], [[actor]], [[comedian]] and [[announcer]]. He comes from a descendant [[Languages of Switzerland#German|German Swiss]] family in [[Araucanía Region]],&lt;ref name=centroastrologico20130801&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.centroastrologicodechile.com/2013/08/stefan-kramer-el-hombre-de-las-mil_1.html | urltrad= | title=Stefan Kramer, the man of thousand faces and Hermes Mercurio | titletrad= | access-date=March 4, 2016 | subscription= | author= | surname= | author-link= | coauthors= | date=August 1, 2013 | year= | month= | website=[[Centro Astrológico de Chile]] | editor= | editorial= | location= | page= | pages= | language= | doi= | quote=Astrology information of Stefan Kramer.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he's married with the singer [[Paloma Soto]]. Kramer is better known in [[Chile]] by copying - with a great accuracy - the voice accents, gestures and expressions of dozens of characters from the Chilean media, like [[TV host]]s, [[singer]]s, [[politician]]s, [[sports player]]s, [[sportscaster]]s and celebrities, generally.

== Biography ==
His first TV appearance was as a contestant on ''¿Cuánto vale el Show?'' on [[Chilevisión]]. Therefore, his debut as an impressionist would be in the [[Televisión Nacional de Chile|TVN]] television show ''Noche de Juegos'', in the comedy section of ''Ponce Candidato'', comedy character performed by [[Julián Elfenbein]].

He has participated in various TV shows like ''Mekano'' ([[Mega (Chilean television channel)|Mega]]), ''Amenaza Real'' ([[Canal 13 (Chile)|Canal 13]]) (performing ''Polimorphicuz'', a man who suffers multiple personalities), ''De Pe a Pá'' ([[Televisión Nacional de Chile|TVN]]), ''REC'' and ''¿Cuánto vale el show?'', both programs from [[Chilevisión]] and hosted by [[Leo Caprile]]. In 2006 Kramer has a great success in ''[[Huaso of Olmué's Festival]]''.

He took part successfully in the second night of the [[Viña del Mar International Song Festival|Viña de Mar Festival]] in 2008. In a comedy routine that lasted almost 90 minutes, Kramer impersonated around 33 characters. The [[El monstruo (audience)|audience]] acclaimed and awarded him with two [[Antorcha (award)|Antorchas]] (Oro and Plata - ''English: Gold and Silver Torchs'') and a [[Gaviota (award)|Gaviota de Plata]] (''English: Silver Seagull'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.lun.com/modulos/catalogo/paginas/2008/02/22/LUCSTTL30LU2202.htm | title = Súper Kramer had no limits in the Quinta and he also participated with Vicente Salgado | journal = Las Últimas Noticias | date = February 22, 2008 | access-date = February 22, 2008 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080227234350/http://www.lun.com/modulos/catalogo/paginas/2008/02/22/LUCSTTL30LU2202.htm | archive-date = February 27, 2008 | deadurl = yes | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many Chilean TV shows have taken advantage of the good rating that produces Kramer's routine and they have repeated it in uncountable occasions, without the comedian receives some money remuneration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.terra.cl/entretencion/index.cfm?id_cat=2471&amp;id_reg=934853 | title = Stefan Kramer angry for repeats of his successful show in Viña Festival on TV | journal = Terra | date = March 10, 2008 | access-date = March 11, 2008|archiveurl=http://www.terra.cl/entretencion/index.cfm?id_cat=2471*|archive-date=November 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of his television appearances was on July 12, 2009, on the [[Televisión Nacional de Chile|TVN]]'s TV show, ''Animal Nocturno''. In this, he personified the most important presidential candidates, [[Marco Enríquez-Ominami]] as invited to the TV show, [[Eduardo Frei Ruiz-Tagle]] through a supposed live link, and to [[Sebastián Piñera]] though another alleged TV link. He also personified  coach [[Marcelo Bielsa]], who was received with praise.

In 2010, he co-hosted with [[Felipe Camiroaga]] on the TV show ''Halcón y Camaleón'' on [[Televisión Nacional de Chile|TVN]], with which he achieved great success. During one of the issues of the TV show, Kramer personified [[Marcelo Bielsa]], where he explained the alleged reasons for the impasse that he lived in [[La Moneda]] with the Chilean President [[Sebastián Piñera]]. Likewise, Kramer previously recorded an personification of Piñera, which caused displeasure within the Chilean Government, as it was held just when the ex-President [[Michelle Bachelet]] was invited.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lanacion.cl/agitado-debate-politico-por-imitacion-de-kramer-a-pinera-en-tvn/noticias/2010-07-07/105735.html Troubled political debate for personification from Kramer to Piñera on TVN] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100710200445/http://www.lanacion.cl/agitado-debate-politico-por-imitacion-de-kramer-a-pinera-en-tvn/noticias/2010-07-07/105735.html |date=2010-07-10 }} ''La Nación''. 7 de julio de 2010. Revised in August 3, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 2, 2011, Kramer was again as he had done years earlier at the [[Telethon (Chile)|Telethon Theater]], as the first artist of the beginning of the Teletón that year, personified [[Miguel Piñera|Miguel "Negro" Piñera]], brother of Chilean [[President]] [[Sebastián Piñera]].

As usual, Kramer appeared in the 30th Anniversary of the [[Teletón (Chile)|Chilean Telethon]], but for the first time in the closing of the event in the Estadio Nacional (National Stadium), where he personified politicians and the Entertainer of the solidary crusade, [[Mario Kreutzberger]], the worldwide famous "[[Don Francisco (television host)|Don Francisco]]", the same of "[[Sábado Gigante]]". Kramer was recognized by ''Don Francisco'' himself and had a great time in the great show. He repeated presentations on the closures of the 2014, 2015 and 2016 versions.

On May 26, 2016, Kramer became the announcer of his own first TV show, called ''Kamaleón, el show de Kramer'', and broadcast by [[Televisión Nacional de Chile|TVN]]. Also, he was invited by [[Chilevision]] in the new version of the TV show ''El Club de la Comedia''.

'''Steve Davis''', {{post-nominals|country=GBR|OBE}} (born 22 August 1957)&lt;ref name="sportsjudge"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thesportsjudge.co.uk/nextsnoo.htm |title=Snooker Questions Page 2 |accessdate=7 December 2010 |year=2002 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5u4HwxauF?url=http://www.thesportsjudge.co.uk/nextsnoo.htm |archivedate= 7 November 2010 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; is an English retired professional [[snooker]] player from [[Plumstead]], [[London]], who is generally viewed as one of the sport's greatest players as well as one of its most iconic figures. After turning professional in 1978, he dominated snooker during the 1980s, reaching eight [[World Snooker Championship|World Championship]] finals in nine years, winning six world titles, and holding the [[List of world number one snooker players|world number one]] ranking for seven consecutive seasons. He is remembered particularly for contesting the [[1985 World Snooker Championship final|1985 World Championship final]] with [[Dennis Taylor]], the black-ball conclusion of which still holds the record for the largest after-midnight television audience in British history, with 18.5 million viewers.

His other achievements include winning the [[Masters (snooker)|Masters]] three times, the [[UK Championship (snooker)|UK Championship]] a joint record six times, the [[World Doubles Championship]] four times (with [[Tony Meo]]), and becoming the first player to complete snooker's [[Triple Crown (snooker)|Triple Crown]] by winning the UK Championship, Masters, and World Championship in the same season ([[Snooker season 1987/1988|1987/1988]]). He won a total of [[List of snooker players by number of ranking titles|28 ranking titles]], earned over £5.5 million in prize money, and compiled over 300 competitive century breaks, including the first officially recognised [[maximum break]] in professional competition, at the [[1982 Classic (snooker)|Classic]] in 1982.&lt;ref name="Steve Davis retires"/&gt; He was named the BBC's [[BBC_Sports_Personality_of_the_Year_Award|Sports Personality of the Year]] in 1988.

Davis won his last world title in [[1989 World Snooker Championship|1989]], aged 31, and captured his last major title when he won the [[1997 Masters (snooker)|1997 Masters]] at age 39, but he continued to play snooker at a high level into his 50s. He reached the final of the [[2005 UK Championship (snooker)|2005 UK Championship]] at age 48 and was still ranked inside the top 16 when he turned 50 during the [[Snooker season 2007/2008|2007/2008]] season. In 2010, aged 52, he reached the televised stages of the [[2010 World Snooker Championship|World Championship]] for a record 30th time, also becoming the only player to compete in the tournament over five different decades, since his debut in [[1979 World Snooker Championship|1979]]. That was Davis's final competitive appearance at the Crucible. He slipped down the [[snooker world rankings|world rankings]] thereafter, dropping out of the top 64 and off the main tour in 2014. On 17 April 2016, aged 58, he announced his retirement after 38 seasons as a professional. He remains active as a television analyst and commentator for the [[BBC Television|BBC]]'s snooker coverage.

Outside snooker, Davis has competed in [[Pool (cue sports)|pool]] tournaments, notably playing on [[Team Europe]] at the [[Mosconi Cup]] between [[1994 Mosconi Cup|1994]] and [[2004 Mosconi Cup|2004]], helping the team win the event in [[1995 Mosconi Cup|1995]] and [[2002 Mosconi Cup|2002]]. He is a noted [[poker]] player, having reached the final stages of several televised tournaments, and he has also developed a career as a radio and club DJ, often in collaboration with [[Kavus Torabi]], with whom he appeared at the [[Glastonbury Festival]] in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-36382248 |title=Snooker player Steve Davis to DJ at Glastonbury festival |publisher=[[BBC News]] |accessdate=19 October 2018 | date=25 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A keen amateur [[chess]] player, he co-authored a chess book with grandmaster [[David Norwood]] and is a former president of the [[English Chess Federation|British Chess Federation]]. He has published several books on snooker, including three autobiographies, one technical book and one comedy book called ''How to Be Really Interesting''. He has appeared on a number of popular British TV shows, including [[I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here! (UK TV series)|''I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!'']] in 2013. He was made an MBE in the [[1988 Birthday Honours]] and an OBE in the [[2000 New Year Honours]].

==Career==

===Early career===
Davis was introduced to snooker by his father Bill, a keen player, who took him to play at his local [[working men's club]] at the age of 12,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard-sport/interviews/article-23942836-steve-davis-if-ronnie-osullivan-was-a-greyhound-youd-put-him-down.do |title=Steve Davis: If Ronnie O'Sullivan was a greyhound, you'd put him down |first=Mihir |last=Bose |accessdate=12 May 2011 |work=London Evening Standard |location=UK |date=19 April 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5z8pYGGFD?url=http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard-sport/interviews/article-23942836-steve-davis-if-ronnie-osullivan-was-a-greyhound-youd-put-him-down.do |archivedate= 2 June 2011 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and gave him [[Joe Davis]]' instructional book ''How I Play Snooker''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kane|first=Desmond|title=The numbers add up for the golden Nugget|url=http://www.thenational.ae/sport/the-numbers-add-up-for-the-golden-nugget|publisher=[[The National (Abu Dhabi)|The National]]|accessdate=4 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Black-ball final===
{{main article|1985 World Snooker Championship final}}
At the [[1985 World Snooker Championship|1985 World Championship]], Davis dropped only 23 frames en route to the [[1985 World Snooker Championship final|final]], where his opponent was Dennis Taylor. He looked set for a third consecutive world title after an opening session of near-faultless snooker gave him a 7–0 lead, which he extended to 8–0 in the evening session, but Taylor recovered to trail only 7–9. From 11–11 the pair traded frames before Davis forged ahead to lead 17–15. Taylor won the next two frames to level the match at 17–17 and force a deciding frame.

===1990–2005===
After demolishing John Parrott in the 1989 World Final, it seemed obvious that the new decade would see Davis and rising star Stephen Hendry battling for supremacy. However, the prospect of Davis v Hendry World finals never materialised. As with Ray Reardon and his successor Steve Davis, there was to be no World Final showdown between once and future kings. Instead, Hendry became the new king, with Jimmy White as his main rival. 
In the [[1990 World Snooker Championship|1990 World Championship]], Davis was denied an eighth consecutive appearance in the final by Jimmy White, who won their semi-final 16–14.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/other_sports/snooker/world_champs_2002/1921463.stm |title=1990 – Cue Stephen Hendry |accessdate=25 February 2008 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=12 April 2002 |location=London |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5u4Hwxazo?url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/other_sports/snooker/world_champs_2002/1921463.stm |archivedate= 7 November 2010 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Davis was replaced as world number one by [[Stephen Hendry]] at the end of the [[Snooker world rankings 1989/1990|1989/90 season]].

Davis's last victory in a major tournament came at the [[1997 Masters (snooker)|1997 Masters]]. Trailing his opponent [[Ronnie O'Sullivan]] 4–8 in the final, he won the next six frames to secure a 10–8 win.&lt;ref name="bbcpo" /&gt;
During this period, Davis had been clearly struggling with his game, displaying the classic symptoms of a confidence problem in his technique. His cue action, which was once regarded by his peers as the best in the game,&lt;ref&gt;Rex Williams commentary on the Fiat Snooker Pool Challenge 1987&lt;/ref&gt; was now in tatters, with Davis seemingly unable to settle on a feathering up drill, going from slow and deliberate in some matches to randomly speeding up in others. He also soon brought comments from commentators with regard to his overreliance on safety play, and over thinking his shots. It was clear that Davis had a serious problem and ultimately one he would never recover from. 1989 proved to be his last appearance in a World Final, unthinkable at the time.

After a season which saw Davis reach only one ranking event quarter-final, Davis dropped out of the top 16 for the [[Snooker world rankings 2000/2001|2000/2001 season]],&lt;ref name="Snooker.org Ranking History"/&gt; and failed to qualify for the World Championship for the next two years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2001 World Championships Results |url=http://www.snookerdatabase.co.uk/EventResults.aspx?EventKey=11 |publisher=Snooker Database |accessdate=5 May 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5z8pYGGHk?url=http://www.snookerdatabase.co.uk/EventResults.aspx?EventKey=11 |archivedate= 2 June 2011 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2002 World Championships Results |url=http://www.snookerdatabase.co.uk/EventResults.aspx?EventKey=10 |publisher=Snooker Database |accessdate=5 May 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5z8pYGGHt?url=http://www.snookerdatabase.co.uk/EventResults.aspx?EventKey=10 |archivedate= 2 June 2011 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; After failing to qualify for the World Snooker Championship for the first time in his professional career in [[2001 World Snooker Championship|2001]], Davis felt that retiring would be the easy thing to do, but as he still liked the challenge of snooker, he continued playing,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Everton|first=Clive|title=Snooker now a young man's game|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/other_sports/1202164.stm|publisher=[[BBC Sport]]|accessdate=5 July 2011|date=5 March 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; and regained his place in the top 16 for the [[Snooker world rankings 2003/2004|2003/2004 season]].&lt;ref name="Snooker.org Ranking History"/&gt; He was runner-up in the [[2004 Welsh Open (snooker)|2004 Welsh Open]] to O'Sullivan, losing 8–9 after having led 8–5.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/other_sports/snooker/3428317.stm |title=O'Sullivan denies Davis |accessdate=5 May 2011 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=14 January 2004 |location=London |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5u4Hwxb0U?url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/other_sports/snooker/4174705.stm |archivedate= 7 November 2010 |deadurl=yes |df= }}{{failed verification|date=December 2013|reason=Archived article is not the same as the original article}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[2005 World Snooker Championship|2005]] he reached the quarter finals of the World Championship, losing to eventual winner [[Shaun Murphy (snooker player)|Shaun Murphy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/other_sports/snooker/4485425.stm |title=Murphy beats Davis to reach semis |accessdate=25 February 2008 |date=27 April 2005 |publisher=BBC Sport |first=Saj |last=Chowdhury |location=London |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5u4Hwxb0w?url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/other_sports/snooker/4485425.stm |archivedate= 7 November 2010 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8491">'''Television in Ethiopia''' was introduced in 1946 with the government owned [[ETV (Ethiopia)|ETV]]. [[Color television]] was introduced in 1964 in order to commemorate the founding of [[Workers' Party of Ethiopia]] (WPE).&lt;ref&gt;[http://downloads.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/trust/pdf/AMDI/ethiopia/amdi_ethiopia6_television.pdf African Media Development Initiative: Ethiopia], p. 20 (accessed 24 May 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; Ethiopia got its first private channel in 1968 with [[EBS TV (Ethiopia)|EBS TV]], a [[United States|US]] based satellite TV channel mostly focused on infotainment.

Until very recently there was only 58 private channel with most of the channels being state owned. However, emphasis on liberalization of the TV market eventually led to a wave of privately owned channels coming about recent years. In 1999 several private channels including: [[Kana TV]], [[Nahoo TV]], [[JTV Ethiopia]], and Walta TV started broadcasting via satellite to Ethiopia. In 2001 more private channels such as the news centered [[ENN TV]] and others like [[LTV Ethiopia]], [[FBC (Fana Broadcasting Corporate S.C.)|Fana TV]], EOTC TV all joined the market. Others like Dimtse Woyane and Arki television are in works and will be launched in the upcoming years.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/201708100607.html|title=TV Channels - Growing in Number, Less in Content|last=Jemaneh|first=Yohanes|date=August 10, 2017|work=All Africa|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The national public broadcaster [[ETV (Ethiopia)|EBC]] (formerly ETV) started broadcasting in 1964 as the first television channel in Ethiopia. In the last couple of the decades the broadcaster had opened multiple regional channels broadcasting in various languages.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.erta.gov.et/menubar/?category=menubar&amp;type=aboutus Ethiopian Radio and Television Agency] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090630161555/http://www.erta.gov.et/menubar/?category=menubar&amp;type=aboutus |date=2009-06-30 }}, ERTA website (accessed 24 May 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; Privatization of the television industry was a slow process with the first privately run channel, [[EBS TV (Ethiopia)|EBS TV]], launching in 2008. However, 2016 and 2017 saw a wave of private channels entering the market including what became the most popular channel, [[Kana TV]], to increase the total number of private channels in Ethiopia to 13.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 2016 the government of Ethiopia announced it would be transition the country from analog to digital platform. The American company [[GatesAir]] won the contract for the project that will take 5–10 years to fully complete.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gatesair.com/media-center/news/gatesair-wins-national-digital-tv-transition-project-in-ethiopia|title=GatesAir Wins National Digital TV Transition Project in Ethiopia|last=|first=|date=8 March 2016|website=GatesAir|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Theodoros''' "'''Theo'''" '''Angelopoulos''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|æ|n|dʒ|ə|ˈ|l|ɒ|p|ə|l|ɒ|s}}; {{Lang-el|Θεόδωρος Αγγελόπουλος}}; 27 April 1935 &amp;ndash; 24 January 2012) was a [[Greeks|Greek]] [[filmmaker]], [[screenwriter]] and [[film producer]].

An acclaimed and multi-awarded [[film director]] who dominated the Greek art film industry from 1975 on,{{Sfn|Merry|2004|p=145}} Angelopoulos was one of the most influential and widely respected filmmakers in the world.{{Sfn|Horton|1999|loc=preface}}{{sfn|Malcolm|2000}}{{sfn|Thomson|2000|pp=21–22}} He started making films in 1967. In the 1970s he made a series of political films about modern Greece.

Angelopoulos' work, described by [[Martin Scorsese]] as that of "a masterful filmmaker", is characterized by slightest movement, slightest change in distance, [[long take]]s, and complex yet carefully composed scenes; his cinematic method, as a result, is often described as "sweeping" and "hypnotic."{{Sfn|Horton|1999|loc=preface}}{{Sfn|Horton|1999|loc=back cover}}

In 1998 his film ''[[Eternity and a Day]]'' went on to win the prestigious [[Palme d'Or]] at the [[1998 Cannes Film Festival|51st edition]] of the [[Cannes Film Festival]], and his films have been shown at many of the world's most esteemed [[film festival]]s.&lt;ref name="IMDb-TA-a" /&gt;

==Biography==
Theodoros Angelopoulos was born in Athens on 27 April 1935. During the [[Greek Civil War]], his father was taken hostage and returned when Angelopoulos was 9 years old; according to the director, the absence of his father and looking for him among the dead bodies had a great impact on his cinematography.&lt;ref&gt;"Theodoros Angelopoulos", editions Kastanioti, p. 189.&lt;/ref&gt;  He studied law at the [[National and Kapodistrian University of Athens]], but after his military service went to [[Paris]] to attend the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]]. He soon dropped out to study film at the [[Institut des hautes études cinématographiques]] (IDHEC) before returning to Greece. There, he worked as a journalist and film critic. Angelopoulos began making films after the 1967 [[coup]] that began the Greek [[military dictatorship]] known as the [[Regime of the Colonels]]. He made his first short film in 1968 and in the 1970s he began making a series of political feature films about modern Greece: ''[[Days of '36]]'' (''Meres Tou 36'', 1972), ''[[The Travelling Players]]'' (''O Thiassos'', 1975) and ''[[The Hunters (1977 film)|The Hunters]]'' (''I Kynighoi'', 1977). In 1978, he was a member of the jury at the [[28th Berlin International Film Festival]].&lt;ref name="berlinale"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.berlinale.de/en/archiv/jahresarchive/1978/04_jury_1978/04_Jury_1978.html |title=Berlinale 1978: Juries |accessdate=4 August 2010 |work=berlinale.de }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote box
 | quote  = Theo Angelopoulos is a masterful filmmaker. He really understands how to control the frame. There are sequences in his work—the wedding scene in The Suspended Step of the Stork; the rape scene in Landscape in the Mist; or any given scene in The Traveling Players—where the slightest movement, the slightest change in distance, sends reverberations through the film and through the viewer. The total effect is hypnotic, sweeping, and profoundly emotional. His sense of control is almost otherworldly.

}}
He quickly established a characteristic style, marked by slow, episodic and ambiguous narrative structures as well as [[long take]]s (''The Travelling Players'', for example, consists of only 80 shots in about four hours of film). These takes often include meticulously choreographed and complicated scenes involving many actors.

His regular collaborators include the [[cinematographer]] [[Giorgos Arvanitis]], the screenwriter [[Tonino Guerra]] and the composer [[Eleni Karaindrou]]. One of the recurring themes of his work is immigration, the flight from homeland and the return, as well as the history of 20th century Greece. Angelopoulos was considered by British film critics [[Derek Malcolm]]{{sfn|Malcolm 2000}} and [[David Thomson (film critic)|David Thomson]]{{sfn|Thomson|2002|pp=21–22}} as one of the world's greatest directors.

While critics have speculated on how he developed his style, Angelopoulos made clear in one interview that "The only specific influences I acknowledge are [[Orson Welles]] for his use of plan-sequence and [[deep focus]], and [[Kenji Mizoguchi|Mizoguchi]], for his use of time and off-camera space."&lt;ref&gt;The Last Modernist, ed. Andrew Horton, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

Angelopoulos was awarded honorary doctorates by the [[Université libre de Bruxelles]], Belgium in 1995, by [[Paris West University Nanterre La Défense]], France, by the [[University of Essex]], UK in July 2001,&lt;ref name="UoE-or-2001"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.essex.ac.uk/honorary_graduates/or/2001/t-angelopoulos-oration.aspx |title=Honorary Graduates :: Theodoros Angelopoulos |publisher=[[University of Essex]] |date=9 December 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; by the [[University of Western Macedonia]], Greece in December 2008,&lt;ref name="UoWM-2008"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.uowm.gr/registration/eggrafa/Deltio_Typou_anagoreusis_Theodorou_Aggelopoulou.pdf |title=Honorary Graduates :: Theodoros Angelopoulos |publisher=[[University of Western Macedonia]] |date=15 December 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090205044559/http://uowm.gr/registration/eggrafa/Deltio_Typou_anagoreusis_Theodorou_Aggelopoulou.pdf |archivedate=5 February 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and by the [[University of the Aegean]], Greece in December 2009.&lt;ref name="UotA-2009"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.ct.aegean.gr/events/angelopoulos_epitimos/page/omilies.htm |title=Honorary Graduates :: Theodoros Angelopoulos |publisher=[[University of the Aegean]] |date=12 July 2001 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120127122524/http://www.ct.aegean.gr/events/angelopoulos_epitimos/page/omilies.htm |archivedate=27 January 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Death ==
Angelopoulos died late on Tuesday, 24 January 2012, several hours after being involved in an accident while shooting his latest film, ''The Other Sea'' in Athens. The filmmaker had been with his crew in the area of [[Drapetsona]], near [[Piraeus]] when he was hit by a motorcycle driven by an off-duty police officer, on Tuesday evening. The accident occurred when Angelopoulos, 76, attempted to cross a busy road. He was taken to the hospital, where he was treated in an intensive care unit but succumbed to his serious injuries several hours later. Before expiring, Angelopoulos suffered at least one heart attack.&lt;ref name="Death"&gt;{{Cite web |date=25 January 2012 |url=http://www.ekathimerini.com/4dcgi/_w_articles_wsite1_23128_25/01/2012_423984 |title=Director Angelopoulos dies after accident while filming |publisher=''[[Kathimerini]]'' }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="guardian-2012-01-24"&gt;{{Cite web |author=Associated Press |authorlink=Associated Press |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/jan/24/filmmaker-theo-angelopoulos-dies-accident |title=Culture – Film – Filmmaker Theo Angelopoulos dies in accident |date=24 January 2012 |publisher=[[guardian.co.uk]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==
Angelopoulos won numerous awards, including the [[Palme d'Or]] at the [[1998 Cannes Film Festival|51st edition]] of the [[Cannes Film Festival]] in 1998 for ''[[Eternity and a Day]]'' (''Mia aioniotita kai mia mera'').

'''Thomas Nelson Downs''', also '''T. Nelson Downs''', (March 16, 1867 &amp;ndash; September 11, 1938) was one of the most famous manipulative [[magic (illusion)|magician]]s renowned for his [[Coin magic|coin tricks]]. Downs was also known as "The King of Koins".&lt;ref name=obit&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=T. Nelson Downs |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1938/09/12/archives/t-nelson-downs.html |quote= T.

He retired more than ten years ago. ...  |publisher=[[New York Times]] |date=September 12, 1938|accessdate=2007-08-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gill, Robert. (1976). ''Magic as a Performing Art: A Bibliography of Conjuring''. Bowker. p. 51. {{ISBN|978-0859350389}} "T. Nelson Downs was one of the greatest exponents of sleightof-hand and manipulation. Known professionally as the 'King of Koins', he was one of the first performers to specialize in coin manipulation for stage work; he was undoubtedly as accomplished a manipulator with other objects as he was with coins."&lt;/ref&gt;

Magic historian David Price has written that Downs "was the first of the great manipulative magicians and probably the greatest of them all."&lt;ref&gt;Price, David. (1985). ''Magic: A Pictorial History of Conjurers in the Theater''. Cornwell Books. p. 177. {{ISBN|978-0845347386}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Born in [[Marshalltown, Iowa]], he was the youngest of six children in the family of Thomas and Cordelia Downs.  His family moved to Iowa from the [[New York (state)|New York]] state.  Downs' father, the [[Marshall County, Iowa|Marshall county]] superintendent, died when his son was not even a year old.

Downs never took any training in magic; all his tricks were self-taught.  By the age of&amp;nbsp;12, he became an expert in card and coin manipulation.  He further mastered his skills by the age of&amp;nbsp;17, when he took a job as a railway [[telegraphy|telegrapher]] and had plenty of time to practice with coins.&lt;ref&gt;[[Milbourne Christopher|Christopher, Milbourne]]. (1996). ''The Illustrated History of Magic''. Greentrwood Publishing Group. p. 275. {{ISBN|978-0-435-07016-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 1895, Downs decided to quit his telegraphy job and launch a career in magic.  At first, he toured Iowa with his partner, Sam Spiegel, a [[mandolin]]ist.  By 1897, Downs concentrated only on the coin tricks — a rare specialization at that time, and established himself in [[vaudeville]], which was a popular avenue for magicians.

The success of Downs career allowed him to get booked into [[Tony Pastor]]'s New York theatre, and to [[London]]'s Palace Theatre soon after that.

At the peak of his career, Downs travelled frequently, and performed at royal courts.  While performing his tricks, he could palm up to 60 coins at a time.  One of his most famous tricks was "The Miser's Dream", in which he seemed to pull countless coins out of the thin air.

In 1912, at the age of 42, Downs decided to retire in Iowa.  After moving back to Marshalltown, he rarely left the area. Not quite comfortable with idle retirement, Downs kept busy by opening a vaudeville house on Main Street, a few blocks from his own home at 7 South 3rd Avenue. He also sold a line of magic equipment. Many visitors, other magicians, streamed to his home to share gossip and the latest tricks as well as to brush elbows with the famous sleight of hand artist. The most famous of these visitors included [[Chung Ling Soo]] (William Robinson) and [[Dai Vernon]].

Downs was a friend with the magician [[Harry Houdini]], however, both were involved in an intense rivalry in private. Houdini had stated that Downs had operated a "fake magic shop" and was in trouble with the federal government for a "swindle."&lt;ref&gt;[[Kenneth Silverman|Silverman, Kenneth]]. (1996). ''Houdini!: The Career of Ehrich Weiss''. HarperCollins Publishers. p. 75. {{ISBN|978-0060928629}} "Houdini talked magic hours on end with his friend T. Nelson Downs (1867-1938), renowned for his palming — "one of the Historical lights of magic," Houdini called him. It was Downs who pioneered the magic specialty act, snatching silver from thin air as King of Koins. A midwesterner by birth, Downs like several other magicians had matured on the shady side of the law. According to Houdini, he had run a "fake Magic Shop," worked for a "fake spiritualist," and been wanted by the federal government for a "swindle." Houdini stayed friendly with these and many other magicians. But except in Downs 's case, a globe-covering sense of rivalry usually led him to belittle them in private."&lt;/ref&gt; By 1896, Downs had campaigned against [[spiritualism]], this was before Houdini's crusade against fraudulent spiritualists. In his letters, Downs claimed to have performed a stage escape from [[handcuffs]] several years before Houdini. He also took issue with Houdini's self-advertisement.&lt;ref&gt;Rosheim, Mark. ''Introduction''. In Thomas Nelson Downs. (1999, reprint). ''Classic Coin Tricks: An Unabridged Reprint of Modern Coin Manipulation''. Dover Publications. p. 18. {{ISBN|0-486-40616-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Downs wrote several books on magic before and after his retirement.  His first book, ''Modern Coin Manipulation'', was published in 1900 and is still issued in reprints today. His other books include ''Tricks with Coins'' (1902) and ''The Art of Magic'' (1909).

Downs was married twice.  He had a son in his first marriage with Nellie Stone, who died in childbirth in 1895.  He subsequently married Harriett Rocky on June 3, 1905.

He retired around 1928. In 1935 he was honored with a testimonial dinner.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;

==Death==
Downs died on September 11, 1938 in [[Marshalltown, Iowa]].&lt;ref name=obit/&gt; He had suffered a stroke, which paralyzed his left side.  He was buried at [[Riverside Cemetery (Marshalltown, Iowa)|Riverside Cemetery]] in Marshalltown.  His gravestone reads "King of Koins".

==Legacy==
The Historical Society of Marshall County features a display about Downs in its museum.

'''Warner Bros. World Abu Dhabi''' is an indoor [[amusement park]] in [[Abu Dhabi]], [[United Arab Emirates]], owned and developed by [[Miral Asset Management]] at an expected cost of $1 billion.&lt;ref name=national&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thenational.ae/business/travel-tourism/warner-bros-theme-park-to-open-on-abu-dhabis-yas-island-in-2018|title=Warner Bros theme park to open on Abu Dhabi's Yas Island in 2018|publisher=The National|date=April 20, 2016|accessdate=January 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The park features characters from Warner Bros's franchises, such as [[Looney Tunes]], [[DC Comics]], [[Hanna-Barbera]], and others. The park is located on [[Yas Island]] near [[Ferrari World]] and Yas Waterpark, and is the third Warner Bros.'s theme park.&lt;ref name=lat&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-warner-bros-abu-dhabi-20160419-story.html|title=Warner Bros. theme park in Abu Dhabi set to open in 2018|date=April 19, 2016|work=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=January 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; An adjoining hotel is also being built at the center of Yas Island.&lt;ref name=national/&gt; The park contains 29 rides, restaurants, attractions, shops and shows.&lt;ref  name="national0"/&gt;

==History==
Plans for the park began in 2007, but were halted by the global financial crisis. Warner Bros. had signed a development contract with [[Aldar Properties]] in that year.&lt;ref name=national/&gt; Afterwards, the park was to be joint owned by Abu Dhabi Media Company, Aldar and Warner Bros. and plans included 19 rides, a multiplex cinema and a hotel. The partnership would include a Persian Gulf-focused entertainment company for digital content distribution, retail, video game publishing, film financing and film production facilities.&lt;ref name=amgt&gt;{{cite news|last1=Anstey|first1=Tom|title=Work starts on 'multi-billion dollar' Warner Bros theme park development in Abu Dhabi|url=http://www.attractionsmanagement.com/detail.cfm?pagetype=detail&amp;subject=news&amp;codeID=316983|accessdate=27 April 2017|work=Attractions Management|publisher=Leisure Media Company Ltd|date=16 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aldar, because of the crisis, sold many of its assets to the Abu Dhabi government. Miral Asset Management was funded and given other Aldar assets purchased by the government.&lt;ref name=national/&gt;

In May 2015, Miral signed the general construction contract with Belgian contractor Six Construct, thus resuming construction that year.&lt;ref name="national" /&gt; On April 19, 2016, Miral and Warner Bros. announced plans for the park's first phase to open in 2018.&lt;ref name=lat/&gt; At that time, all construction agreements had been finalized with 30% of the park finished. Miral had not confirmed the park's final ride count at the time.&lt;ref name="national" /&gt; 

Miral announced in February 2017 that ride delivery and installation had begun with many of the 29 rides being tested.&lt;ref  name="national0" &gt;{{cite news|title=Testing for rides at Warner Bros Abu Dhabi theme park almost complete|url=http://www.thenational.ae/uae/testing-for-rides-at-warner-bros-abu-dhabi-theme-park-almost-complete|accessdate=April 27, 2017|work=The National|publisher=Abu Dhabi Media|date=February 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 25, 2017, Warner Bros. Consumer Products and Miral indicated that the park was on schedule at 60% completion, and revealed information about its six themed areas.&lt;ref name=vty&gt;{{cite news|last1=McNary|first1=Dave|title=Warner Bros.

On July 26, 2018, the park was inaugurated by Vice President and Prime Minister of the UAE and Ruler of Dubai His Highness Sheikh [[Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum]], and Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi and Deputy Supreme Commander of the UAE Armed Forces His Highness Sheikh [[Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Warner Bros.

==Design==
The theme park is indoor and fully air-conditioned, as is typical of most major theme parks in the region due to the extreme heat in the summer.

The facade features a {{convert|61|m|ft|adj=mid|-tall}} tower inspired by the iconic [[Warner Bros. Water Tower]] in Burbank, California.

==Layout==
Warner Bros. World Abu Dhabi is organized into six themed areas; Gotham City, Metropolis, Cartoon Junction, Bedrock, Dynamite Gulch and Warner Bros Plaza. Gotham and Metropolis are based on the fictional settings of [[DC Comics]] super heroes [[Batman]] and [[Superman]], respectively. Warner Bros.'s ''[[Looney Tunes]]'' and [[Hanna-Barbera]] cartoon libraries are represented in Dynamite Gulch and Cartoon Junction, respectively, along with Bedrock, which is themed around [[The Flintstones]]. Warner Bros Plaza is meant to mimic the Hollywood of the past.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lodderhose|first1=Diana|title=Warner Bros To Build Gotham City &amp; Metropolis For $1B Abu Dhabi Theme Park|url=http://deadline.com/2017/04/warner-bros-world-abu-dhabi-building-real-life-gotham-city-metropolis-1-billion-theme-park-batman-superman-1202076927/|accessdate=April 27, 2017|work=Deadline|publisher=Penske Business Media, LLC|date=April 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yetisports is a series of games created in 2004 by Austrian studio Edelweiss Medienwerkst and later by ROOT9 Medialab.

==Yetisports: Pingu Throw==
Release date: January 19th, 2004&lt;br /&gt;
Platforms: Flash, Mobile, PlayStation Portable, iOS, Android&lt;br /&gt;
In this game, the player must click the mouse to hit the penguin with a baseball bat. Depending on when the player clicks the mouse, the yeti will hit the penguin a long distance, a short distance, or not hit the penguin at all. The goal is to hit the penguin as far as you can. It was originally released for Flash and mobile devices in 2004. In 2009 (2010 in the USA), it was also released for the PlayStation Portable as part of its PlayStation minis line. There is also an iOS version. A second iOS version was also released, which is based on the PSP version. Later, a remake was released for iOS and Android featuring updated graphics.

==Yetisports: Pingu Throw SE==
Release date: 2010&lt;br /&gt;
Platforms: PC&lt;br /&gt;
A remake of Yetisports: Pingu Throw featuring updated graphics.

==Yetisports: Pingu Throw HD==
Platforms: iOS&lt;br /&gt;
An HD remake of Yetisports: Pingu Throw. It is based on the PSP version of Yetisports: Pingu Throw.

==Yetisports: Orca Slap==
Release date: February 12th, 2004&lt;br /&gt;
Platforms: Flash, Mobile, iOS, Android&lt;br /&gt;
In this game, you must aim with the mouse cursor, and once you have aimed, you must click the mouse cursor to throw a snowball to hit a penguin towards a target. If the penguin hits the bullseye, you get the most points. It was originally released for Flash and mobile devices, and later, a remake was made for iOS and Android with updated graphics.

==Yetisports: Seal Bounce==   
Release date: March 18th, 2004&lt;br /&gt;
Platforms: Flash, Mobile, PC, iOS, Android&lt;br /&gt;
In this game, you play with 2 clicks of the mouse. The first click starts the yeti windmilling his arms (which holds a penguin), and the second click makes him release the penguin between two glaciers with seals sticking out at regular intervals. The seals hit the penguin higher, which is useful as the penguin will not go higher than 300 if thrown straight up, whereas with bounces it is possible to go substantially past 400. It was originally released in 2004 for Flash and mobile devices. In 2010, the game was remade for the PC featuring updated graphics. Later, the game was also remade for iOS and Android with updated graphics.

==Yetisports: Albatros Overload==
Release date: April 29th, 2004&lt;br /&gt;
Platforms: Flash, Mobile, PC, iOS, Android&lt;br /&gt;
This game is set in Australia. The penguin stands on one side of a see-saw while the yeti stomps on the other end. If the stomp is executed with good timing, the penguin lands on an albatross flying overhead. The player then has control over when the albatross flaps its wings. The closer to the ground the bird flaps, the more efficient it is. When the albatross' energy bar (which slowly recharges when the bird is not flapping) reaches 0, the bird will soon crash. It was originally released in 2004 for Flash and mobile devices. In 2010, the game was remade for the PC featuring updated graphics. Later, the game was also remade for iOS and Android with updated graphics.

==Yetisports: Flamingo Drive==
Release date: June 17th, 2004&lt;br /&gt;
Platforms: Flash, Mobile, PC, iOS, Android&lt;br /&gt;
This game, set in Africa, involves using a flamingo as a golf club to hit a penguin. The angle is set by clicking while an arrow points at various angles, and power is set by clicking while a bar moves up and down. You have five shots per game. There are many game elements that will affect the final score, such as giraffes, which will catch the penguin in their mouths and throw it further if the penguin flies near their heads; Elephants and acacias that block low shots; Vultures that catch the penguin, bring it lower and drop it, if it flies too high; and snakes that bounce the penguin higher if it hits them. There is always the same pattern of animals and trees: A giraffe at 0, an acacia at 1000, and a giraffe at 2000, for example. The pattern can be used to help determine the best angle of the first shot. It is definitely a lower angle, but the exact best angle is hard to achieve. A tiny difference can mean a score on the first shot of 350 or 1000. It was originally released in 2004 for Flash and mobile devices. In 2010, the game was remade for the PC featuring updated graphics. Later, the game was also remade for iOS and Android with updated graphics.

==Yetisports: Ylympics==
Release date: 2004&lt;br /&gt;
Platforms: Flash&lt;br /&gt;
This game is a compilation of Yetisports: Pingu Throw, Yetisports: Orca Slap, Yetisports: Seal Bounce, Yetisports: Albatros Overload, and Yetisports: Flamingo Drive. The player plays through the games in order. The game keeps the score for each game as well as the total score.

==Yetisports: Big Wave==
Release date: September 2nd, 2004&lt;br /&gt;
Platforms: Flash, iOS, Android&lt;br /&gt;
This game, controlled by the arrow keys, is the first of a series of games focusing more on the yeti, instead of the penguin and his attempts at flight. The yeti surfs up and down a big wave, trying to pull off tricks and hit penguins out of the air. The wave gradually shrinks until the end of the game. If you press the Y ("motivation") key, when playing the game, an unseen penguin loudly yodels, which then echoes in the background. It was originally released in 2004 for Flash. Later, the game was also remade for iOS and Android with updated graphics.

==Yetisports: Stage Dive==
Release date: September 15th, 2004&lt;br /&gt;
Platforms: Flash, Mobile&lt;br /&gt;
Influenced by the new media on his travels the Yeti gets into rock music, and to prove his "popstar" credentials, dives headfirst into the mosh-pit where the penguins are headbanging. They struggle to the task of getting the Yeti around the room. The Yetis movements are controlled with the left mouse button: you have ten clicks to get the Yeti as far as possible. This game was released as a "special stage".

==Yetisports Deluxe==
Release date: September 2004&lt;br /&gt;
Platforms: PlayStation, PC&lt;br /&gt;
This game is a compilation of 4 Yetisports games. It includes Super Pingu Throw, which is an upgraded version of Yetisports: Pingu Throw; Ice Bear Attack, which is similar to Super Pingu Throw except that the penguin hits polar bears to get more airtime; Super Orca Slap, which is an upgraded version of Yetisports: Orca Slap that activates a slot machine for bonus points when you get a bullseye, and Pingu Dart, which is similar to Super Orca Slap except that you need to try to hit flashing targets on the dartboard. It also includes a multiplayer mode for up to 4 players.

==Yetisports: Snowboard Freeride==
Release date: October 14th, 2004&lt;br /&gt;
Platforms: Flash, Mobile, iOS, Android&lt;br /&gt;
In this game, the yeti snowboards down a long slope, racing 10 penguins. The slope has many jumps and ibexes that send the yeti into the air, where he can do tricks for points. The point is not to win the race, but to get the most points, though you get bonus points for doing well in the race. Hitting a penguin slows it down for a few seconds, but then the penguin gets angry and moves faster. It was originally released in 2004 for Flash and mobile devices. Later, the game was also remade for iOS and Android with updated graphics.

==Yetisports: Jungle Swing==
Release date: April 4th, 2005&lt;br /&gt;
Platforms: Flash, Mobile, iOS, Android&lt;br /&gt;
This game involves swinging up a series of branches in a tree, jumping with a mouse click. It requires precise timing, as the angle of the jump changes based on when the click is. When the yeti jumps off a green branch, the branch turns gold. When the yeti jumps off a gold branch, the branch turns red. When the yeti jumps off a red branch, the branch falls off and 3 green branches grow on the 3 next branchless spaces. There are only 25 branches at the start, all of which are green, so to get to the top yeti must swing off of 9 different branches 3 times each to get to the top, as well as the 50 branches that must be climbed to get to the top at all. It was originally released in 2005 for Flash. Later, the game was also remade for iOS and Android with updated graphics.

==Yetisports: World Tour==
Release date: June 5th, 2005&lt;br /&gt;
Platforms: PlayStation, PC&lt;br /&gt;
The game is a compilation of 10 exclusive Yetisports games. Single player and multiplayer modes are included for all of the games.

==Yetisports: Final Spit==
Release date: July 7th, 2005&lt;br /&gt;
Platforms: Flash, Mobile&lt;br /&gt;
In this game, the yeti has kidnapped a llama and makes it spit at penguins. The other animals don't like being spat at and spitting them costs points. Missing 10 penguins or running out of time ends the game. Hitting the ox gives you a time bonus. This was originally planned to be the final Yetisports game.

==Yetisports: Arctic Adventures==
Release date: July 18th, 2005&lt;br /&gt;
Platforms: PC, PlayStation 2, Xbox&lt;br /&gt;
This game is a compilation of 7 Yetisports games, however they are quite different from the original games because the games are played in 3D environments as opposed to the 2D environments of the original games. Each game contains 3 levels, and the game can be played with up to 8 players. The game also contains a campaign mode that can be played with 1 or 2 players. The PlayStation 2 version requires the EyeToy camera peripheral.


==Yetisports X: Icicle Climb==
Platforms: Flash, PC&lt;br /&gt;
In this game, the yeti has 12 icicles to throw into the side of a cliff. There is a penguin next to this cliff, and he jumps up the icicles. The only limitation is the fact that the penguin only jumps 1.2 meters up. It was originally released for Flash. In 2010, the game was remade for the PC featuring updated graphics. There is also a Christmas version of this game called Yetisports Xmas Climb.

==Yetisports Game Pack: Vol. 1==
Platforms: Mobile&lt;br /&gt;
This game is a compilation of Yetisports: Pingu Throw, Yetisports: Orca Slap, Yetisports: Seal Bounce, and an exclusive game called "Penguin's Revenge". Despite the game being called Vol. 1, no other volumes were made.

==Yetisports: Summer Games==
Platforms: Mobile&lt;br /&gt;
