'''Alison Begbie''', '''Ellison Begbie''' or '''Elizabeth Gebbie''' (1762-1823), is said to have been the daughter of a farmer, born in the parish of [[Galston, East Ayrshire|Galston]], and at the time of her courtship by [[Robert Burns]] she was a servant employed at Carnell House, then known as Cairnhill,&lt;ref&gt;Hunter, Page 169&lt;/ref&gt; close to the River Cessnock, situated about 2 miles from Loudoun. It is thought that Burns' sister confused her name and that she was actually Elizabeth Gebbie.

==Life and character==
Alison may have lived at Old Place, now Shawsmill Farm, the daughter of a tenant-farmer.&lt;ref name=My&gt;Mackay, Page 84&lt;/ref&gt; Burns was living at [[Lochlea, South Ayrshire|Lochlea Farm]] at this time.&lt;ref name=B&gt;[http://www.robertburns.org/encyclopedia Robert Burns Encyclopedia] Retrieved : 9 February 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Although not a beauty, she had many charming qualities, inspired by an education somewhat beyond anything that Burns had ever encountered before in a female.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldburnsclub.com/expert/the_lassies_who_inspired_burns.htm World Burns Club] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111217072915/http://www.worldburnsclub.com/expert/the_lassies_who_inspired_burns.htm |date=17 December 2011 }} Retrieved : 9 February 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Alison met Burns in 1781 near [[Lochlea, South Ayrshire|Lochlea Farm]] and had hoped to set up a household of his own with her.&lt;ref&gt;Hecht, page 34&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dougall, Page 232&lt;/ref&gt; Her rejection&lt;ref&gt;Hecht, Page 35&lt;/ref&gt; of him may have significantly contributed to the depressive illness that he suffered whilst living and working in [[Robert Burns and the Eglinton Estate|Irvine]].

Alison's surname was difficult to pair in rhyme, so Robert is said to have used artistic licence and named her in his work as 'Peggy Alison'.

Burns said of her ''"All these charming qualities, heightened by an education much beyond anything I have ever met in any woman I ever dared to approach, have made an impression on my heart that I do not think the world can ever efface."''&lt;ref&gt;Hill, Page 17&lt;/ref&gt;

She was flattered enough however to commit Burns's 'Cessnock Banks' verses about her to memory and when an older lady, living in Glasgow, at 74 King Street. This lady was able to repeat them, 26 years after first hearing them, to Robert Hartley Cromek of Hull,&lt;ref name=bc&gt;Paton, Page 192&lt;/ref&gt; the author of the 1811 publication ''"Reliques of Burns."'' He does not give the first name of Mrs Brown, simply stating that the song was from ''"A lady residing in Glasgow, whom the bard in early life affectionately admired."''&lt;ref&gt;Cromek, Page 187&lt;/ref&gt; Elizabeth Gebbie and her family are known to have moved to Glasgow.&lt;ref&gt;Dougall, Page 139&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=eg&gt;Mackay, Page 89&lt;/ref&gt;

===Elizabeth Gebbie===
Isobel Burns, later Begg, provided the name Alison Begbie to the Burns biographer Dr Robert Chambers when she was 76 years of age, recollecting events and details from when she was ony 9 or 10 years old.&lt;ref&gt;MacKay, Page 83&lt;/ref&gt; Research by James Mackay suggests that 'Elison Begbie' was in fact a confused recollection of the name Elizabeth Gebbie, a surname which does appear in the Galston parish register. Thomas Gebbie was a tenant-farmer at Pearsland Farm near Galston and had a daughter, Elizabeth on 22 July 1762. Elizabeth married Hugh Brown at Newmilns on 23 November 1781 and had two daughters, Helen and Agnes,&lt;ref name=hb&gt;Mackay, Page 88&lt;/ref&gt; she had died by June 1823.&lt;ref name=eg&gt;Mackay, Page 89&lt;/ref&gt; This Elizabeth appears to have rejected Robert Burns which left him with a deep emotional scar, reflected possibly in the use of this Christian name for three of his daughters.&lt;ref&gt;Mackay, Page 90&lt;/ref&gt;

She may have been the heroine of one of Burns's earliest songs 'Farewell to Eliza.'&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldburnsclub.com/expert/Burns%20Facts/0900_burns_facts_23-27.htm World Burns Club] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100126010855/http://www.worldburnsclub.com/expert/Burns%20Facts/0900_burns_facts_23-27.htm |date=26 January 2010 }} Retrieved : 11 April 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

==Association with Robert Burns==
[[File:PG 1063Burns Naysmith.jpg|thumb|Full view of the Naysmith portrait of 1787, [[Scottish National Portrait Gallery]]]]
She may have met Burns during his visits to collect lime with his father from the Cairnhill kiln close to her home and place of work.&lt;ref name=My/&gt;

Although five letters from Burns were claimed by Dr James Currie to have been sent to Alison Begbie,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.auldlangsyne.org.uk/letters/ Auld Lang Syne] Retrieved : 10 February 2012&lt;/ref&gt; only one in manuscript form survives, this being the first, in which Burns hopes, using the introduction ''"My dear E"'', the recipient will not despise him because he is ''"ignorant of the flattering arts of courtship."'' The others letters were only found in draft form among Burns's papers as lent to him by [[Jean Armour]]. A proposal of marriage is made in the fourth letter: ''"If you will be so good and so generous as to admit me for your partner, your companion, your bosom friend through life, there is nothing on this side of eternity shall give me greater transport."''&lt;ref name=B/&gt; it seems that he may have been too shy to propose to her in person.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freefictionbooks.org/books/r/23527-the-real-robert-burns-by-j-l-hughes?start=45 The Real Robert Burns] Retrieved : 9 February 2012&lt;/ref&gt; It is clear from the fourth letter that a reply had been received from ''"My dear E"''.&lt;ref name=be&gt;Paton, Page 196&lt;/ref&gt;

In an autobiographical letter Robert Burns stated that in his 23rd year ''"a bellefille whom I adored"'', jilted or refused him ''"with peculiar circumstances of mortification."'' It was Isabella Burns who first said that Alison Begbie was the person her brother referred to, for the fifth letter in the series, supposedly to Begbie, gives no indication of the existence of any such proposal and refusal. The letters may not have been his personal letters and at all, written instead by Burns on behalf of another individual in an unrelated romantic relationship.&lt;ref name=B/&gt;

Alison is likely to be the ''"lass of Cessnock Banks"'' who inspired ''"On Cessnock banks a lassie dwells"'', and the Peggy Alison of ''"Ilk care and fear, when thou art near"'', both of whom appear in the tunes of ''"The Butcher Boy"'' and ''"Braes o' Balquidder."'' Alison may also have been the central figure of the love song ''"O Mary at thy window be"'' for [[Mary Morison]], the central figure, is thought to have actually met Robert Burns on only one occasion.&lt;ref name=B/&gt; Burns called this ''Cessnock Lass'' work his ''Song of Similes'' and it was set to the tune ''if he be a Butcher neat and trim.''&lt;ref name=bc/&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

Burns's sister relates a curious anecdote connected with Alison. Robert was sometimes very late in returning from the Cessnock Banks, and one night William Burns sat up to let him in and administer a rebuke to his son. William enquired of his son where he had been, and Burns, by way of explanation, told him that he had met the Devil in coming home. This story quite put his father off track and the rebuke was forgotten.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.electricscotland.com/burns/burns_ylover.htm The Life of Robert Burns] Retrieved : 10 February 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

[[James Hogg]], the Ettrick Shepherd, commented that ''" There is no doubt hanging and marriage go by destiny, else Burns should have had this sensible girl."''&lt;ref&gt;Hill, Page 21&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''All-Party Parliamentary Group for Choice at the End of Life''' is a cross-party group of members of the British Parliament and Peers that supports better end-of-life options, including assisted dying. They believe that, subject to legal safeguards, terminally-ill adult patients should have the option of an assisted death in their final stages of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=About — All-Party Parliamentary Group for Choice at the End of Life |url=http://www.appg-endoflifechoice.org.uk/about/ |accessdate=2 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, this [[All-party parliamentary group|APPG]] launched a draft a bill for assisted dying&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Draft assisted dying bill consultation comes to an end with almost 500 submissions |url=https://www.dignityindying.org.uk/news/draft-assisted-dying-bill-consultation-comes-end-almost-500-submissions/ |accessdate=6 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was presented to the [[House of Lords]] by [[Lord Falconer]] in 2013. The proposed bill was debated in 2014 but ran out of time in the run up to the 2015 General Election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Lord falconers assisted dying bill (2014) |url=https://www.dignityindying.org.uk/assisted-dying/the-law/lord-falconers-assisted-dying-bill-2014/ |accessdate=6 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A version of the bill tabled by [[Rob Marris]] was eventually voted on and defeated in the House of Commons in September 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Assisted dying bill overwhelmingly rejected by MPs |url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/sep/11/mps-begin-debate-assisted-dying-bill |accessdate=6 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The chair is [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] MP [[Nick Boles]], who faced a potentially life-threatening illness before supporting the campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Why I’ve changed my mind on assisted dying, says NICK BOLES MP |url=https://www.express.co.uk/life-style/life/974558/assisted-dying-bill-nick-boles-mp |accessdate=2 August 2018 |date=15 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He succeeded [[Kit Malthouse]] MP as chair, who said it is "the great human rights campaign of our political generation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Kit Malthouse to Chair the Choice at the End of Life All Party Party Parliamentary Group |url=https://www.northwesthampshireconservatives.org.uk/news/kit-malthouse-chair-choice-end-life-all-party-party-parliamentary-group |accessdate=4 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The secretary is [[Jim Fitzpatrick (politician)|Jim Fitzpatrick]] MP&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=House of Commons - Register Of All-Party Parliamentary Groups |url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm/cmallparty/180829/choice-at-the-end-of-life.htm |accessdate=6 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the secretariat is provided by the non-profit assisted dying campaign group [[Dignity in Dying]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=About — All-Party Parliamentary Group for Choice at the End of Life |url=http://www.appg-endoflifechoice.org.uk/about/ |accessdate=2 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Araucaria''''' ({{IPAc-en|pron|æ|r|ɔː|ˈ|k|ɛər|i|ə}}; original pronunciation: [a.ɾawˈka. ɾja])&lt;ref&gt;{{OED|araucaria}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[genus]] of [[evergreen]] [[Pinophyta|coniferous]] [[tree]]s in the family [[Araucariaceae]]. There are 20&amp;nbsp;[[extant taxon|extant]] [[species]] in [[New Caledonia]] (where 14&amp;nbsp;species are [[endemism|endemic]], see [[New Caledonian Araucaria|New Caledonian ''Araucaria'']]), [[Norfolk Island]], eastern [[Australia]], [[New Guinea]], [[Argentina]], [[Chile]], and [[Brazil]].

==Description==
[[File:Araucaria araucana cones.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.84|''[[Araucaria araucana]]'' with seed [[Conifer cone|cones]]]]
''Araucaria'' are mainly large trees with a massive erect stem, reaching a height of {{convert|5|-|80|m}}. The horizontal, spreading branches grow in whorls and are covered with leathery or needle-like [[leaf|leaves]]. In some species, the leaves are narrow, awl-shaped and lanceolate, barely overlapping each other; in others they are broad and flat, and overlap broadly.&lt;ref name="gymdb"/&gt;

The trees are mostly [[Plant sexuality|dioecious]], with male and female [[Conifer cone|cones]] found on separate trees,&lt;ref name="pinetum"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pinetum.org/adviceAR.htm |title=Practical seedling growing: Growing ''Araucaria'' from seeds |publisher=Arboretum de Villardebelle |accessdate=18 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; though occasional individuals are [[Plant sexuality|monoecious]] or change sex with time.&lt;ref name="simmons"&gt;{{cite book |author=Michael G. Simpson |title=Plant Systematics |publisher=Academic Press |year=2010 |page=151 |isbn=978-0-12-374380-0 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dj8KRImgyf4C&amp;lpg=PA151&amp;ots=-OllQpVoL1&amp;dq=Araucaria%20monoecious&amp;pg=PA151#v=onepage&amp;q=Araucaria%20monoecious&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; The female cones, usually high on the top of the tree, are [[globose]], and vary in size among species from {{convert|7|to|25|cm}} diameter. They contain 80–200&amp;nbsp;large [[Eating|edible]] seeds, similar to [[pine nut]]s, though larger. The male cones are smaller, {{convert|4|-|10|cm|abbr=on}} long, and narrow to broad cylindrical, {{convert|1.5|-|5.0|cm|abbr=on|1}} broad.

The genus is familiar to many people as the genus of the distinctive Chilean pine or monkey-puzzle tree (''[[Araucaria araucana]]''). The genus is named after the Spanish [[exonym]] ''Araucano'' ("from [[Arauco Province|Arauco]]") applied to the [[Mapuche]]s of central [[Chile]] and south-west [[Argentina]], whose territory incorporates natural stands of this genus. The Mapuche people call it ''{{lang|arn|pehuén}}'', and consider it sacred.&lt;ref name="gymdb"/&gt; Some Mapuches living in the Andes name themselves ''{{lang|arn|Pehuenches}}'' ("people of the ''{{lang|arn|pehuén}}''") as they traditionally harvested the seeds extensively for food.&lt;ref name="ntbg"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ntbg.org/plants/plant_details.php?plantid=867|title=''Araucaria columnaris''|publisher=[[National Tropical Botanical Garden]] |accessdate=19 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="moreno"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bariloche.com.ar/museo/MAPUING.HTM |title=Pehuenches: "The people from the Araucarias forests" |author=Francisco P.

No distinct vernacular name exists for the genus. Many are called "pine", although they are only distantly related to true pines, in the genus ''[[Pinus]]''.

[[File:Three araucarias.jpg|thumb|Three members of the genus growing together – left to right, ''[[Araucaria columnaris]]'', ''[[Araucaria cunninghamii]]'' and ''[[Araucaria bidwillii]]'']]
Members of ''Araucaria'' are found in [[Chile]], [[Argentina]], [[Brazil]], [[New Caledonia]], [[Norfolk Island]], [[Australia]], and [[New Guinea]]. There is also a significant, naturalized population of ''Araucaria columnaris'' – "Cook's pine" – on the island of [[Lanai]], in [[Hawaii]], USA.&lt;ref&gt;[http://everything-everywhere.com/2011/05/21/the-pine-trees-of-lanai/ The Pine Trees of Lanai]&lt;/ref&gt; Many if not all current populations are [[relict]]s, and of restricted distribution. They are found in [[forest]] and [[maquis shrubland]], with an affinity for exposed sites. These columnar trees are [[living fossil]]s, dating back to early in the [[Mesozoic]] age. [[Fossil]] records show that the genus also formerly occurred in the northern hemisphere until the end of the [[Cretaceous]] period.

By far the greatest diversity exists in [[Geography of New Caledonia|New Caledonia]], due to the island's long isolation and stability.&lt;ref name="gymdb"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.conifers.org/ar/Araucaria.php |title=''Araucaria'' Jussieu 1789 |author=Christopher J. Earle |date=12 December 2010 |publisher=The Gymnosperm Database |accessdate=13 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much of New Caledonia is composed of [[ultramafic]] rock with [[serpentine soil]]s, with low levels of nutrients, but high levels of metals such as [[nickel]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://newcaledoniaplants.com/plant-catalog/maquis-shrubland-plants/ Plants of New Caledonia.

There is evidence to suggest that the long necks of [[sauropod]] [[dinosaur]]s may have evolved specifically to browse the foliage of the typically very tall ''Araucaria'' trees.

[[File:Bioreactor principle.svg|thumb|210px|General structure of a continuous stirred-tank type bioreactor]]

A '''bioreactor''' may refer to any [[manufacture]]d or [[engineering|engineered]] device or system that supports a biologically active environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{GoldBookRef|title=bioreactor|url=http://goldbook.iupac.org/B00662.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; In one case, a bioreactor is a vessel in which a [[chemical reaction|chemical process]] is carried out which involves [[organism]]s or [[biochemistry|biochemically]] active [[chemical substance|substance]]s derived from such organisms. This process can either be [[Aerobic organism|aerobic]] or [[Anaerobic organism|anaerobic]]. These bioreactors are commonly cylindrical, ranging in size from litres to cubic metres, and are often made of [[stainless steel]].

It may also refer to a device or system designed to grow [[Cell (biology)|cells]] or [[Biological tissue|tissues]] in the context of [[cell culture]]. These devices are being developed for use in [[tissue engineering]] or [[biochemical engineering]].

On the basis of '''mode of operation''', a bioreactor may be classified as [[batch reactor|batch]], [[fed-batch|fed batch]] or [[continuous reactor|continuous]] (e.g. a [[continuous stirred-tank reactor model]]). An example of a continuous bioreactor is the [[chemostat]].

Organisms growing in bioreactors may be submerged in liquid medium or may be attached to the surface of a solid medium. Submerged cultures may be suspended or immobilized. Suspension bioreactors can use a wider variety of organisms, since special attachment surfaces are not needed, and can operate at much larger scale than immobilized cultures. However, in a continuously operated process the organisms will be removed from the reactor with the effluent. Immobilization is a general term describing a wide variety of cell or particle attachment or entrapment.&lt;ref&gt;Lopez A, Lazaro N, Marques AM. The interphase technique: a simple method of cell
immobilization in gel-beads. J Microbiol Methods, 1997, 30:231-234.&lt;/ref&gt; It can be applied to basically all types of
biocatalysis including enzymes, cellular organelles, animal and plant cells.&lt;ref&gt;Peinado PA, Moreno JJ, Villaba JM, Gonzalez-Reyes JA, Ortega JM, Mauricio JC. A new immobilization method and their applications. Enzyme Microb Tech, 2006, 40:79-84.&lt;/ref&gt; Immobilization is useful for continuously operated processes, since the organisms will not be removed with the reactor effluent, but is limited in scale because the microbes are only present on the surfaces of the vessel.

Large scale immobilized cell bioreactors are: 
*moving media, also known as [[moving bed biofilm reactor|moving bed biofilm reactor (MBBR)]]
*[[packed bed]]
*[[fibrous bed]]

==Design==
[[Image:Pg166 bioreactor.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A closed bioreactor used in cellulosic ethanol research]]

Bioreactor design is a relatively complex engineering task, which is studied in the discipline of [[biochemical engineering]]. Under optimum conditions, the microorganisms or cells are able to perform their desired function with limited production of impurities. The environmental conditions inside the bioreactor, such as temperature, nutrient concentrations, pH, and dissolved gases (especially oxygen for aerobic fermentations) affect the growth and productivity of the organisms. The temperature of the fermentation medium is maintained by a cooling jacket, coils, or both. Particularly exothermic fermentations may require the use of external heat exchangers. Nutrients may be continuously added to the fermenter, as in a fed-batch system, or may be charged into the reactor at the beginning of fermentation. The pH of the medium is measured and adjusted with small amounts of acid or base, depending upon the fermentation. For aerobic (and some anaerobic) fermentations, reactant gases (especially oxygen) must be added to the fermentation. Since oxygen is relatively insoluble in water (the basis of nearly all fermentation media), air (or purified oxygen) must be added continuously. The action of the rising bubbles helps mix the fermentation medium and also "[[air stripping|strips]]" out waste gases, such as carbon dioxide. In practice, bioreactors are often pressurized; this increases the [[Henry's law|solubility of oxygen]] in water. In an aerobic process, optimal oxygen transfer is sometimes the rate limiting step. [[Oxygen]] is poorly soluble in water—even less in warm fermentation broths—and is relatively scarce in [[air]] (20.95%). Oxygen transfer is usually helped by agitation, which is also needed to mix nutrients and to keep the fermentation homogeneous. [[Mixing (process engineering)#Liquid-gas mixing|Gas dispersing agitators]] are used to break up air bubbles and circulate them throughout the vessel.

''[[Fouling]]'' can harm the overall efficiency of the bioreactor, especially the [[heat exchanger]]s. To avoid it, the bioreactor must be easily cleaned. Interior surfaces are typically made of stainless steel for easy cleaning and sanitation. Typically bioreactors are cleaned between batches, or are designed to reduce fouling as much as possible when operated continuously. Heat transfer is an important part of bioreactor design; small vessels can be cooled with a cooling jacket, but larger vessels may require coils or an external heat exchanger.

==Types==

===Photobioreactor===
[[File:Bioreaktor quer2.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Moss bioreactor|Moss photobioreactor]] with ''[[Physcomitrella patens]]'']]
A [[photobioreactor]] (PBR) is a bioreactor which incorporates some type of light source (that may be natural sunlight or artificial illumination). Virtually any [[translucent]] container could be called a PBR, however the term is more commonly used to define a closed system, as opposed to an open [[tank]] or [[pond]].
Photobioreactors are used to grow small [[phototroph]]ic organisms such as [[cyanobacteria]], [[alga]]e, or [[moss]] plants.&lt;ref&gt;Eva L. Decker und [[Ralf Reski]] (2008): Current achievements in the production of complex [[biopharmaceuticals]] with moss
bioreactor. Bioprocess and Biosystems Engineering 31, 3-9 [http://www.springerlink.com/content/ux267q4q14736845/fulltext.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; These organisms use light through [[photosynthesis]] as their [[energy]] source and do not require [[sugar]]s or [[lipid]]s as energy
source. Consequently, risk of [[contamination]] with other organisms like [[bacterium|bacteria]] or [[fungus|fungi]] is lower in
photobioreactors when compared to bioreactors for [[heterotroph]] organisms.

===Personal bioreactors===
A simplified continuous bioreactor that is designed for non-professionals, enables the growth of E. coli bacteria cells under aerobic or anaerobic conditions. These bioreactors do not rely on autoclavability, but instead rely on chemical inactivation for reuse. A laptop-sized Personal Bioreactor and Transformation station for bioengineering. It includes: continuous culturing system with remote-monitoring, real time date streaming, on-screen instructions, plate incubator, heat + ice-cold stations. Suitable for bacterial growth and culturing.
[[File:Personal bioreactor for non-professionals.png|thumb|Personal bioreactor for non-professionals]]

===Sewage treatment===
Conventional [[sewage treatment]] utilises bioreactors to undertake the main purification processes. In some of these systems,  a chemically inert medium with very high surface area is provided as a substrate for the growth of  biological film.  Separation of excess biological film takes place in  settling tanks or cyclones . In other systems [[Water aeration#Aeration methods|aerator]]s supply oxygen to the sewage and biota to create [[activated sludge]] in which the biological component is freely mixed in the liquor in "flocs". In these processes, the liquid's [[Biochemical Oxygen Demand]] (BOD) is reduced sufficiently to render the contaminated water fit for reuse. The biosolids can be collected for further processing, or dried and used as fertilizer. An extremely simple version of a sewage bioreactor is a septic tank whereby the sewage is left in situ, with or without additional media to house bacteria. In this instance, the biosludge itself is the primary host for the bacteria.

===NASA tissue cloning bioreactor===
[[File:Loading bioreactor.jpg|thumb|A bioreactor used to ferment ethanol from corncob waste being loaded with yeast.]]
In bioreactors in which the goal is to grow cells or tissues for experimental or therapeutic purposes, the design is significantly different from industrial bioreactors. Many cells and tissues, especially mammalian ones, must have a surface or other structural support in order to grow, and agitated environments are often destructive to these cell types and tissues. Higher organisms, being [[Auxotrophy|auxotrophic]], also require highly specialized growth media.

[[NASA]] has developed a new type of bioreactor that artificially grows tissue in cell cultures.  NASA's tissue bioreactor can grow heart tissue, skeletal tissue, ligaments, cancer tissue for study, and other types of tissue.&lt;ref&gt;https://science.nasa.gov/NEWHOME/headlines/msad05oct99_1.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

For more information on artificial tissue culture, see [[tissue engineering]].

== Modelling ==
Mathematical models act as an important tool in various bio-reactor applications including wastewater treatment. These models are useful for planning efficient [[process control]] strategies and predicting the future plant performance. Moreover, these models are beneficial in education and research areas.

Bioreactors are generally used in those industries which are concerned with food, beverages and pharmaceuticals. The emergence of ''[[Biochemical engineering]]'' is of recent origin. Processing of biological materials using biological agents such as cells, enzymes or antibodies are the major pillars of biochemical engineering. Applications of biochemical engineering cover major fields of civilization such as agriculture, food and healthcare, [[resource recovery]] and fine chemicals.

Till now, the industries associated with biotechnology have been lagged behind other industries in implementing control over the process and optimization strategies. A main drawback in biotechnological process control is the problem to measure key physical and biochemical parameters.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.it.uu.se/edu/course/homepage/modynsyst/vt11/Lecture/DynSystBior2009.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Operational stages in a bio-process ===
A bioprocess is composed mainly of three stages &amp;mdash; upstream processing, bioreaction, and downstream processing &amp;mdash; to convert raw material to finished product.

The raw material can be of biological or non-biological origin. It is first converted to more suitable form for processing. This is done in upstream processing step which involves chemical hydrolysis, preparation of liquid medium, separation of particulate, air purification and many other preparatory operations.

After upstream processing step, the resulting feed is transferred to one or more Bioreaction stages. The Biochemical reactors or bioreactors form the base of the Bioreaction step. This step is mainly consists of three operations namely, production of [[biomass]], metabolize biosynthesis and biotransformation.

Finally, the material produced in the bioreactor must be further processed in the downstream section to convert it into more useful form. The downstream process is mainly consists of physical separation operations which includes, solid liquid separation, [[adsorption]], [[Liquid–liquid extraction|liquid-liquid extraction]], [[distillation]], [[drying]] etc.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=CHEMICAL PROCESS MODELLING AND COMPUTER SIMULATION|last=Jana|first=AMIYA K.|publisher=PHI Learning Pvt. Ltd.|year=2011|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Specifications ===
A typical bioreactor consists of following parts:

'''Agitator –''' used for the mixing of the contents of the reactor which keeps the “cells” in the perfect homogenous condition for better transport of nutrients and oxygen to the desired product(s).

'''Baffle –'''  used to break the vortex formation in the vessel, which is usually highly undesirable as it changes the center of gravity of the system and consumes additional power.

'''Sparger –''' In aerobic cultivation process, the purpose of the sparger is to supply adequate oxygen to the growing cells.

'''Jacket –''' The jacket provides the annular area for circulation of constant temperature of water which keeps the temperature of the bioreactor at a constant value.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://iitd.vlab.co.in/?sub=63&amp;brch=177&amp;sim=647&amp;cnt=1|title=Bioreactor- Basics|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Development of modelling equations for bioreactors ===
{{Tone|section|date=July 2016}}
{{Move to Wikiversity|date=July 2016}}

Assumptions –
* The reactor contents are perfectly mixed together.
* The reactor is operating at a constant temperature (i.e., it is isothermal).
* The feed should be clean and pure (i.e., no biomass in the feed stream).
* The feed stream and reactor contents have equal and constant density (''ρ).''
* The feed and product streams have the same flow rate (F).

==== Total continuity equation ====
Making overall mass balance, we get the following equation:

d(''ρV)/dt     =    Fρ – Fρ     =    0                                                           (1)''

Equation(1) states that the reactor volume (V) is constant since dV/dt = 0.

==== Biomass continuity equation ====
We know,

Flow rate of biomass into the reactor = Fx&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;

Flow rate of biomass out of the reactor = Fx

Rate of generation of biomass by reaction = Vr&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;

Rate of accumulation of biomass within the reactor = d(Vx)/dt

Now, apply general mass balance equation i.e.,

''Rate of Mass In – Rate of Mass Out + Rate of Generation = Accumulation''

d(Vx)/dt =  Fx&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; – Fx + Vr&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;                                                                     (2)

Where '''r&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''' is the rate of cell generation. Dividing both sides of the above equation by V, we obtain

dx/dt = (F/V)x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; – (F/V)x + r&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;                                                                  (3)

In the [[chemical reaction engineering]], '''F/V''' is called '''space velocity'''(s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;) and '''V/F''' is called the '''residence time''' (s). But in [[biochemical engineering]], '''F/V''' is known as '''Dilution rate (D&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;)'''. Accordingly, equation(3) yields:

dx/dt = D&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; – D&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;x + r&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;                                                                           (4)

dx/dt = D&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;(x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; – x) + r&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;                                                                            (5)

==== Substrate continuity equation ====
For substrate balance,

Flow rate of substrate into the bioreactor   = FS&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;

Flow of the substrate out of the bioreactor = FS

Rate of generation of substrate by reaction = –Vr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

Rate of accumulation of substrate within the reactor = d(VS)/dt

Now, apply general mass balance equation i.e.,

''Rate of Mass In – Rate of Mass Out + Rate of Generation = Accumulation''

d(VS)/dt = FS&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;  – FS – Vr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;                                                                       (6)

rearranging above equation, we get

dS/dt = D&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;(S&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; –S ) – r&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;                                                                             (7)

where '''r&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''' is the rate of substrate consumption.

==== Biochemical reaction kinetics ====
For the chemical reaction,

A ----&gt; P

We can write

( –r&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;) = k (C&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;                                                                                                                (8)

(r&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;) = – k (C&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;                                                                                                                (9)

Where,

( –r&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;)  = rate of disappearance of A

(r&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;)     = rate of formation of A

k         = reaction rate constant

C&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;       = Concentration of reactant A

n          = order of reaction with respect to component A

For first order reaction, n  = 1 and accordingly,

–r&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; = k C&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;

The reaction kinetics involved in biochemical operations is comparatively difficult to obtain than the chemical reaction kinetics. In biochemical operations, the cell kinetics is used for the unstructured models where balanced growth condition is assumed.

The following equation is used to represent the net  rate of cell mass growth:

r&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = ''μx                                                                                                  (10)''

''where μ'' is the specific growth rate or specific growth rate coefficient(s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;). Here, ''μ'' is analogous to first order rate constant k but however, ''μ'' is not a constant.

In biochemical engineering, '''yield''' is defined as the ratio of mass or moles of product formed to the mass or moles of the reactants consumed. The yield (Y) of product (P) with respect to reactant A is defined as:

Y = (mass of P formed )/(mass of A consumed)                                  (11)

In case of bioreactor,

Y = (mass of cells formed)/(mass of substrate consumed)                  (12)

Thus,

Y = r&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/ r&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

Or,

r&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = r&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/Y

Or,

r&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = ''μx/''Y                                       ( from 10)                                        (13)

==== Final form of equation of modelling ====
By substituting equations (10) &amp; (13) in equations (5) &amp; (7) respectively, we get,

'''dx/dt = D&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;(x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; – x) + ''μx'''''                                                                                                      (14)

'''dS/dt = S(S&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; – S) – (''μx/Y)'''''                                                                                                 (15)

Since we have assumed that the feed stream does not contain any biomass i.e., '''x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; = 0''', then, bioreactor modelling equation finally get the following form:

'''dx/dt = (''μ'' – D&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;)x'''                                                                                                               (16)

'''dS/dt = S(S&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; – S) – (''μx/Y)'''''                                                                                              ''(from 15)''

Thus,Equations (15) and (16) are the basic equations which are used for the modelling of any bioreactor.

The '''Biosciences Federation''' (BSF) was a [[United Kingdom]] body formed in 2002.

==Function==
The Federation aimed to unite the [[bioscience]] community over issues of common interest that related to both research and teaching. These organisations are a key component of the UK's [[knowledge economy]]. It also aimed to influence the formulation of UK policy relating to biosciences, and to promote public debate on ethical issues. Its interests were in using knowledge gained in research to benefit society, and the impact of legislation on the life sciences industry.

===Events===
Each November, it would hold the ''Life Sciences Careers Conference''.

==Structure==
During October 2009, the Biosciences Federation was merged with the [[Institute of Biology]] (IoB) to form the [[Society of Biology]] (which boasts some 80,000 members).&lt;ref&gt;[http://societyofbiology.org/newsandevents/news/view/19 - The IoB &amp; BSF merge to form the Society of Biology (5 October 2009)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The last president of the Federation was Dame [[Nancy Rothwell]] (2006–9); [[Richard Dyer (biologist)|Richard Dyer]], former director of the [[Babraham Institute]], was the chief executive officer (2006–9). Sir [[Tom Blundell]] was a former president (2004–6).

===Affiliated organisations in the federation===
From 2007, the Biosciences Federation encompassed 51 member or associated organisations that covered the entire range of life sciences; these included 
* [[Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry]]
* [[Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour]]
* [[AstraZeneca]]
* [[Biochemical Society]]
* [[British Andrology Society]]
* [[British Association for Psychopharmacology]]

* [[Royal Microscopical Society]]
* [[Society for Endocrinology]]
* [[Society for Applied Microbiology]]
* [[Society for Experimental Biology]]
* [[Society for General Microbiology]]
* [[UK Environmental Mutagen Society]]
* [[Zoological Society of London]]

==Activities==
The Federation responded to government consultations on biology-related issues; these responses were published on the Federation's website. It also distributed science policy news to a range of organisations that included universities, research councils, pharmaceutical companies and government bodies. The Federation hosted several life sciences careers conferences and symposia on issues such as [[Open access (publishing)|open access]] publishing. It also supported the annual award for scientific communication.

'''''Bloom''''', written in 1998, is the fifth [[science fiction]] novel written by [[Wil McCarthy]].  It was first released as a hardcover in September 1998.  Almost a year later, in August 1999, its first mass market edition was published. An [[ebook]] reprint was published in 2011.

''Bloom'' is one of Borders' "Best 10 Books of 1998" and is a ''[[New York Times]]'' Notable Book.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Science fiction notable books of the year 1998|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=December 6, 1998|url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/98/12/06/reviews/notable-scifi.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The premise of the book is how to handle human technology that has evolved beyond human control.

==Plot summary==
''Bloom'' is set in the year 2106, in a world where [[grey goo|self-replicating nanomachines]] called "Mycora" have consumed [[Earth]] and other planets of the inner solar system, forcing humankind to eke out a bleak living in the [[asteroid]]s and [[Galilean moons]].  Two groups of humanity are described—The Immunity, who use "[[Nuclear transmutation|ladderdown]]" technology and [[augmented reality]] and live on the moons of Jupiter, and The Gladholders, who use human [[intelligence amplification]] and [[artificial intelligence]] and live in the asteroid belt. The story begins on [[Ganymede (moon)|Ganymede]] with an article about a “bloom”, or outbreak of Mycora, that serves to emphasize the danger and horror of this technogenic life (TGL).  The article is written by Strasheim, the main character. He is first seen in the office of Lottick, portrayed as a major public figure, who has called him there for an unknown purpose.

Lottick tells Strasheim that the Mycora have apparently been stealing human [[gene sequence]]s and may develop resistance to the coldness of the outer system, which incites concern. Readers learn that a mission to drop some TGL detectors onto Mars's, Earth's, and the Moon's polar ice caps has been approved, and Lottick asks Strasheim to go along as a [[reporter]]. For the longer term, a starship is being constructed to colonize other star systems before the Mycora.

Strasheim agrees, and goes to meet the other crew-members and inspect the ship, which is called the ''Louis Pasteur''.  The ship is technologically camouflaged to protect the crew against Mycora.  Somehow, someone releases a Mycora bloom in the hangar, killing one crew member and forcing the others to launch the ''Pasteur'' and escape—departing three weeks earlier than planned, and without adequate supplies.

Because of their forced launch, the ''Pasteur'' docks at Saint Helier, a medium-sized Floral [[asteroid]] of the Gladholders to pick up supplies.  While there, they are surprised multiple times, but what shocks them most is that the asteroid's inhabitants have apparently discovered, through powerful telescopes, human life on Venus, co-existing with the Mycora.

Shaken, the crew continues on their journey, but become aware that one of the crew is sabotaging the mission.  The saboteur turns out to be a woman named Baucum, with which Strasheim has a conflicted, partly sexual, relationship. She is secretly a member of the Temples of Transcendent Evolution, a fringe political/religious group that believes the Mycora are divine, investing large sums of money in researching them.  After being found out, Baucum ruptures a storage bag inside herself that had been carrying spores of Mycora.  Terrified, the crew responds, with Strasheim himself shoving her out an airlock before the Mycora now consuming her can also devour the ship.

Later, it is revealed that the mission has a somewhat more violent purpose than the crew was led to believe.  The "detectors" they have by this time dropped on Mars, Earth, and Luna can actually be repurposed as "cascade [[Nuclear fusion|fusion]]" devices.  The mission's actual purpose was to establish small footholds on the three bodies, but it occurs to Strasheim that if such a device were detonated in the Sun, a massive blast of laddered-down iron would wipe out most Mycoran life in the inner solar system. Several of the Temples' ships have chased them since Mars, and are desperately attempting to destroy the ''Pasteur'' against this possibility (The ''Pasteur'' is heading toward the Sun to get away from the Mycosystem via an out-of-plane slingshot, but the action could have been construed differently by Temples' agents.).

It transpires that the Temples were also correct about Mycora motives, as shortly after relaying this information, the Mycora are attracted to the transmission and break through the ''Pasteur''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'s hull, blooming, and unexpectedly assuming the form of an (unspecified) pseudo-human spokesperson.  A standoff ensues, but it seems the Mycora is [[Sapience|sapient]] and without ill-will toward humans.  Communication is brief but apparently paradigm-shattering.  The ambassador explains that nearly every person consumed on Earth or on the evacuation out-system was incorporated into the Mycosystem and are still alive in some sense, their consciousness and intelligence adjusted to run on the cellular-automata-like Mycora substrate, "Unpacked". The crew is given information on how to mark areas as off-limits to the Mycosystem. They are told that humanity is, "...Utterly free. Free to conduct your lives in the classical manner, to escape this solar system, to populate the stars. Free to Unpack, if you choose."

The book ends almost thirteen years later, with a description of how the captain of the ''Pasteur'' has been diagnosed with a terminal disease and requests that Strasheim (now a successful media magnate) be his witness as he joins the Mycora.&lt;ref&gt;McCarthy, Wil: ''Bloom'', Del Ray Books, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characters==
* '''John Strasheim''' – The main character.  Works as a [[shoemaking|cobbler]] on Ganymede, but is also a very good amateur journalist.  It is the latter skill which causes him to be selected for the journey to the Earth.
* '''Vaclav Lottick''' – Introduced as the most powerful man in the solar system, he is the head of research for the Immunity and the man who invites Strasheim on the mission to earth.
* '''Darren Wallich''' - Captain of the ''Louis Pasteur'', has had a “tickle capacitor” implant, which makes his personality seem more likable.  
* '''Tosca Lehne''' – Another crewmember.  One of the inventors of the t-balance, which coats the outside of the ''Pasteur'' with the purpose of making it appear to be part of the Mycosystem.
* '''Jenna Davenroy''' – A nuclear engineer in her 40s.  She is the ladderdown expert on the ''Pasteur'' and also its chief propulsion monitor.
* '''Tug Jinacio''' – A Response lieutenant, responsible for handling emergencies on the ''Pasteur'' (ex. fire, bloom, etc.) Killed in the hangar bloom.
* '''Renata Baucum''' – Bioanalyst on the ''Pasteur'', who turns out to be a traitor. Killed when she ruptures the Mycora hidden within her and Strasheim blows her out of an airlock.
* '''Sudhir Rapisardi''' – Coordinated the design of the TGL (technogenic life) detectors that the ''Pasteur'' will place on the earth to monitor the Mycora.  Is the biophysicist on the ''Pasteur''.
* '''Chris Dibrin''' – sent by the Governor to show the ''Pasteur'' crew around Saint Helier.  He has an artificial intelligence implanted into his brain that enables him to think faster.

==The ''Louis Pasteur'' Spaceship==
Named after [[Louis Pasteur]] the French microbiologist and chemist, the ship is described as being very small and having an unusual external covering invented by Lehne called the t-balance.

According to Strasheim, the ''Pasteur'' is "like a bathroom with seven shower stalls and a streetcar cockpit wedged incongruously at one end, a utility closet wedged in the other."  Rather cramped quarters for a crew of seven going on a voyage that will take about two years.

The purpose of the t-balance is to convince the Mycora that the ship is part of it by means of tactile camouflage.  It is described as a gleaming rainbow gray colored coating that appeared to be made up of millions of minuscule dots, each of which also appears to be made up of millions of tiny dots, and so on.  The t-balance also gives off the illusion that the dots are moving.  Unfortunately for the ''Pasteur'''s crew, although the t-balance should work in theory, it has not yet been tested because the only way to do so is by surrounding it with Mycora.

==Places==
* '''Ganymede''': Where the story begins.  It is one of Jupiter's moons and home to people who are protected from the Mycora by the Immunity.
* '''Ansharton''': A large city on Ganymede where Lottick's office is.
* '''Philusburg''': A smaller city on Ganymede where Strasheim and his mother live.
* '''Galileo''': The city/base/port where the ''Pasteur'' is docked on Ganymede.
* '''Saint Helier''': A Floral asteroid where the Pasteur docks to stock up on supplies.

==Terms/Organizations==
* '''Immunity''': A defensive system used by the people on Ganymede (as well as those on the other outer planets) to keep spores of Mycora from invading.  Also a term used by people under its protection to refer to themselves.
* '''Ladderdown''': System of [[Nuclear transmutation|converting elements into other elements]] further down the [[Periodic Table]].  As a result of using this system, the inhabitants of the Immunity have a plethora of high-numbered elements lying around.  For example, they have so much gold they use it to weigh down their shoes and pave the streets.
* '''Mycora''': A substance that appears to be [[grey goo]], but is in actuality a type of technogenic life form created by humans that escaped their control and began consuming everything around it.  It has also evolved from its original state and adapted to an environment where there is nothing left to consume.  Throughout the book, [[Conway's Game of Life]] is used as an imperfect example of how the Mycora operates.
* '''Temples of Transcendent Evolution''': Originally formed on [[Callisto (moon)|Callisto]], it is an organization that invests large sums of money into research about the Mycora.  They are spiritually inclined and believe that the Mycora is "a presence greater than themselves".

'''''Brick''''' is a 2005 American [[neo-noir]] [[Mystery film|mystery]] film written and directed by [[Rian Johnson]] in his directorial debut, starring [[Joseph Gordon-Levitt]].  ''Brick'' was distributed by [[Focus Features]], and opened in New York and Los Angeles on April 7, 2006.

The film's narrative centers on a [[hardboiled]] [[detective fiction|detective story]] set in a Californian [[suburb]]. Most of the main characters are high school students. The film draws heavily in plot, characterization, and dialogue from hardboiled classics, especially those by [[Dashiell Hammett]]. The title refers to a block of [[heroin]], compressed roughly to the size and shape of a brick.

The film won the Special Jury Prize for Originality of Vision at the 2005 [[Sundance Film Festival]],&lt;ref name=telegraph/&gt; and received positive reviews from critics. It has come to be regarded as a [[cult classic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tobias|first1=Scott|title=The New Cult Canon: Brick|url=http://www.avclub.com/article/embrickem-28276|website=The A.V. Club|accessdate=2 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
High school student Brendan Frye ([[Joseph Gordon-Levitt]]) lives a lonely existence following his breakup with ex-girlfriend Emily Kostich ([[Emilie de Ravin]]) and his betrayal of his friend Jerr to the authorities. Brendan discovers a note leading him to a pay phone, where he receives a call from a terrified Emily begging him for help. She mentions a "brick", "poor Frisco", "Tug", and "the Pin" before abruptly hanging up. Her fear appears to have been caused by a passing black [[Ford Mustang]], from which a distinctive-looking cigarette was thrown. Upon asking for information from his nerd friend Brain ([[Matt O'Leary]]), Brendan's search for Emily sends him to another ex-girlfriend, "drama vamp" Kara ([[Meagan Good]]), which in turn leads him to a Halloween party attended by flirtatious upper-class popular girl Laura Dannon ([[Nora Zehetner]]) and her boyfriend, Brad Bramish ([[Brian J. White]]).

Laura points Brendan in the direction of a local diner, where he arranges a meeting through Dode ([[Noah Segan]]), leader of a [[Cannabis culture|stoner]] clique that Emily belongs to. Upon meeting, Emily recants what she had said on the phone and tells Brendan to let her go. Brendan steals her notepad during the encounter and finds a note that leads him directly to her dead body. Emotionally distraught by her death, Brendan takes it upon himself to solve her murder, enlisting the aid of Brain. Brendan hides the body to avoid police intrusion. Brendan discovers that "the Pin" ([[Lukas Haas]]) is a local [[drug baron]]. After finding out that Brad is a regular customer of the Pin's, Brendan sets about getting the latter's attention by beating up Brad. Afterwards, Brendan is in turn beaten up by an unknown young man while speaking on the phone with Brain.

Brendan visits Assistant Vice Principal Trueman ([[Richard Roundtree]]) to ask him if he could investigate the events, without mentioning Emily's death, as a favour for turning in Jerr. While Trueman allows Brendan to continue his investigation, he warns that if Brendan gets caught, Trueman will "throw him under the bus". Brendan visits Kara, to request more information about the Pin, although she fobs him off. Later while walking, Brendan sees the same black Ford Mustang in a parking lot. Before attempting to break into the car, he is noticed and beaten up by the car's owner, who is the man who beat him previously. Brendan asks the man several times to meet the Pin. Reluctant at first, going so far as to drive away and then come back again, the young man takes Brendan to the Pin.

Brendan meets with the Pin and persuades him to consider Brendan for a spot in his operation. It is also revealed that the unknown man is Tug ([[Noah Fleiss]]), the Pin's main grunt and muscle. The Pin tells Brendan he will either hire him or rub him out by the next day. On the walk back home, Laura tells Brendan that the Pin had previously rejected Emily's attempt to join, so she stole the Pin's brick. Laura then offers to help Brendan, but he distrusts her. While Brendan awaits a response from the Pin at school, he is slashed by a knife-wielding man. After a chase, Brendan incapacitates the assailant and the Pin accepts him. Brendan gets a call from Dode, who says he saw Brendan hide Emily's body and, believing Brendan is the murderer, vows to ruin him. Brendan meets with the Pin, who suspects an uprising from Tug.

Brain reports that "poor Frisco" is Frisco Farr, a student who fell into a [[coma]] after injecting poorly-cut heroin. At the Pin's house, Tug tells Brendan that the Pin received a shipment of 10 bricks and sold eight; one was stolen and replaced with another that had been doctored with detergent, causing Frisco's coma, and the 10th brick remains to be sold. The Pin arrives and tells Tug about hearing from someone who knows what happened to Emily. Brendan, weakened from several recent fistfights, intercepts Dode before the meeting and discovers Emily was pregnant when she died. Dode hints to Tug and the Pin that he has information about who killed Emily, saying it is someone very close, but Tug goes berserk and beats Dode before shooting him in the head. Tug then threatens the Pin, who walks away as Brendan faints from a coughing fit. Brendan awakens in Tug's bedroom, where Tug says he's at war with the Pin.

Brendan confronts Kara, accusing her of manipulating Dode by telling him Emily was carrying his baby and pushing him to sell his information to the Pin. Brendan arranges a meeting between Tug and the Pin, and waits in Tug's bed; Laura enters to comfort him as he sobs over Emily, and they have sex. Brendan recognizes her post-sex cigarette as the same distinctive brand that was dropped from Tug's black Mustang after Emily was frightened during the first phone call. At the meeting, chaos erupts when it is discovered that the 10th brick is now missing. Tug beats the Pin to death while Brendan flees, escaping just as police arrive. As he goes, he passes the trunk of Tug's car, where he has hidden Emily's body to ensure that police pin her murder on Tug.

The next day, Brendan meets with Laura in the school's football field. Brendan explains to Laura that he knows she set Emily up to take the fall for Laura's theft of the ninth brick. She further manipulated Emily into meeting Tug, who ultimately killed her after letting him believe he was responsible for Emily's pregnancy. It is revealed that Laura later stole the 10th brick as well. Brendan tells Laura he has put this truth in a note to Vice Principal Trueman, who will find the brick in Laura's locker if, in fact, what he says is true. Laura vindictively tells Brendan that Emily expressed regret that she couldn't keep her pregnancy because she did not love the prospective father, and that Emily was three months pregnant when she died, implying that the baby was his. Brendan watches Laura walk away.

==Production==
===Development===
[[File:Rian Johnson &amp; Joseph Gordon-Levitt by Gage Skidmore.jpg|right|thumb|Rian Johnson with Joseph Gordon-Levitt in March 2012.]]
The origins of ''Brick'' were [[Rian Johnson]]'s obsessions with [[Dashiell Hammett]]'s novels.&lt;ref name=telegraph/&gt; Hammett was known for [[hardboiled]] [[Detective fiction|detective novels]], and Johnson wanted to make a straightforward American detective story. He had discovered Hammett's work through an interview of the [[Coen brothers]] about their 1990 gangster film, ''[[Miller's Crossing]]''. He read ''[[Red Harvest]]'' (1929) and then moved on to ''[[The Maltese Falcon (novel)|The Maltese Falcon]]'' (1930) and ''[[The Glass Key]]'' (1931), the latter of which had been the main influence for the Coens' film.&lt;ref name= "tobias"/&gt; Johnson had grown up watching detective films and film noir. Reading Hammett's novels inspired him to make his own contribution.&lt;ref name= "tobias"/&gt; He realized that this would result in a mere imitation and set his piece in high school to keep things fresh. Of the initial writing process he remarked "it was really amazing how all the archetypes from that detective world slid perfectly over the high school types". He also wanted to disrupt the visual traditions that came from the genre. Once he started making ''Brick'', he found it "very much about the experience of being a teenager to me".&lt;ref name= "tobias"/&gt; Johnson maintained that the film was not autobiographical.&lt;ref name=telegraph/&gt;

Johnson wrote the first draft in 1997 after graduating from [[USC School of Cinematic Arts]] a year earlier.&lt;ref name= "tobias"/&gt; He spent the next seven years pitching his script, but no one was interested, because the material was too unusual to make with a first-time director. Johnson estimated the minimal amount of money for which he could make the film, and asked friends and family for backing.&lt;ref name= "tobias"/&gt; His family were in the construction industry, and contributed enough to encourage others to contribute.&lt;ref name=telegraph/&gt; After Johnson had acquired about $450,000 for the film's budget,&lt;ref name=telegraph/&gt; ''Brick'' began production in 2003.

===Filming===
Although the film was shot in 20 days, Johnson spent a great deal of time beforehand refining the script and three months rehearsing with the cast.&lt;ref name=telegraph/&gt; He had seen Joseph Gordon-Levitt in a film called ''[[Manic (2001 film)|Manic]]'' (2001), met with him, and knew that he wanted to cast the young actor.&lt;ref name= "tobias"/&gt; He encouraged the cast to read Hammett but not to watch any noir films, because he did not want them influencing their performances. Instead, he had them watch [[Billy Wilder]] comedies like ''[[The Apartment]]'' (1960) and other comedies like ''[[His Girl Friday]]'' (1940). He was initially nervous working with a professional cast and crew for the first time but as soon as he started filming, this feeling went away and he had a good experience.&lt;ref name= "tobias"/&gt;
[[File:Brickfield.jpg|thumb|223x223px|San Clemente High School Football Field]]
Johnson shot the film in his hometown of [[San Clemente, California]] on [[35 mm film]] stock. Much of the film takes place at [[San Clemente High School (San Clemente, California)|San Clemente High School]], which he attended. He enlisted current students to work on the film, shooting on weekends. The cinematographer was [[Steve Yedlin]], a film school friend who had been involved with the project since the script was written.&lt;ref name=telegraph/&gt;
[[File:Brickstreetsign.jpg|left|thumb|Street sign for Del Rio and Sarmentoso]]
For the telephone booth scenes, Johnson and crew filmed deep in the San Clemente suburbia. The same sign for the cross streets of Sarmentoso and Camino del Rio still stands. However, the phone booth itself was a prop the production department added in for the film.

Coffee and Pie Oh My! was a Carrows restaurant, but it has since been abandoned.
[[File:Brick Drain Tunnel.jpg|thumb|269x269px|Drain tunnel under the Pico exit ramp.]]
The drain tunnel from the film is located just down the street from the San Clemente High School football field and goes under the freeway by the Pico exit off-ramp.

Johnson had difficulty finding a run-down house for the Pin's base of operations. The production found an appropriate house, but only had a week until it was demolished to rebuild on its lot. The basement was a set that they built, but the Pin's kitchen and living room still exists at the Blarney Castle bed and breakfast. Johnson also had difficulty finding a mansion for the party scene until, with one day left to find the location, a former Telecom executive and eccentric millionaire allowed them to shoot in his place which was still under construction. The big mansion was packed from floor to ceiling with pay phones dating back to the 1950s.

Johnson cited [[Sergio Leone]] [[Spaghetti Western]]s and [[Shinichiro Watanabe]]'s ''[[Cowboy Bebop]]'' (1998) as influences on his visualization of the film.&lt;ref name= "prodnotes"/&gt;&lt;ref name="visuals"/&gt;&lt;ref name="visuals"&gt;{{cite web
| url = http://www.rcjohnso.com/forum/viewtopic.php?p=2350&amp;sid=587c10758d5009ad4225fcaa91ef524b#p2350

}}&lt;/ref&gt; He used shoes as a design element for his characters and saw them as an "instant snapshot of the essence" of the characters.&lt;ref name= "seattlest"/&gt; He has also stated that many of the film's visual cues were taken from the neo-noir ''[[Chinatown (1974 film)|Chinatown]]'' (1974) with its wide-open flat spaces.

===Special effects===
The majority of the film's [[special effects]] were cheaply and efficiently produced using [[Practical effect|practical]] and [[In-camera effect|in-camera]] effects.&lt;ref name= "brickaudio"/&gt; Early in the film, for example, de Ravin walks toward the camera out of a tunnel as a garbage bag floats downstream and engulfs the camera, transitioning to Joseph Gordon-Levitt back in his character's bedroom. To achieve this, the desired effect was filmed in reverse order. The garbage bag began over the camera and was pulled away during filming, as de Ravin walked backwards into the tunnel. This footage was then cut into a scene in which a garbage bag was simply pulled over Gordon-Levitt's head.&lt;ref name= "brickaudio"/&gt;

Filming a car driving slowly in reverse, then playing the footage backwards at a higher speed gives the illusion of a car quickly approaching as the camera darts in front of it stylishly.&lt;ref name= "brickaudio"/&gt; Clever fades give the impression of time changes while [[smash cut]]s add tension to a scene in which the protagonist wakes up after passing out. Certain edits were also introduced to the film to time footage to different dialogue, adding certain information and leaving other information out. These edits are noticeable, as the actors' mouths are not always moving in sync with their dialogue. One particular scene, in which de Ravin's character floated toward the camera, used a [[Chroma key|green screen]], but it was edited out of the film before its completion.&lt;ref name= "brickaudio"/&gt;

===Editing===
The original cut of the film ran over two hours, although it was edited down to 117 minutes for the Sundance Film Festival. An additional 7 minutes were cut before the theatrical release, including a shot of Zehetner's naked back as she put her shirt back on after she and Gordon-Levitt's character had sex. According to a post by Johnson on his own forums, he felt that the nudity felt wrong in the context of the film, and that he preferred to leave the degree of intimacy ambiguous, although he occasionally finds himself second-guessing that decision.&lt;ref name="deletedscenesrelated"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.rcjohnso.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=513 | title = Deleted Scenes and related questions | first = Rian | last=Johnson | work = Rian's Forum | publisher=rcjohnso.com | date = May 2006 | accessdate = 2007-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nakedlaura"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.rcjohnso.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=132 | title = Naked Laura | first = Rian | last=Johnson | work = Rian's Forum | publisher=rcjohnso.com | date = April 3, 2006 | accessdate = 2007-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Music===
{{main|Brick (soundtrack)}}
The [[film score|score]] to ''Brick'' was composed by Johnson's cousin, [[Nathan Johnson (musician)|Nathan Johnson]], with additional support and music from [[The Cinematic Underground]]. The score harkens back to the style, feel and overall texture of noir films. It features traditional instruments such as the piano, trumpet and violin, and also contains unique and invented instruments such as the wine-o-phone, [[metallophone]], [[tack piano]]s, [[filing cabinet]]s, and [[kitchen utensil]]s, all recorded with one microphone on an [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] [[PowerBook]]. Since Nathan Johnson was in [[England]] during most of the production process, the score was composed almost entirely over Apple [[iChat]], with Rian playing clips of the movie for Nathan, who would then score them. The two met in [[New York City]] to mix the soundtrack. The [[film soundtrack|soundtrack]] CD of the movie was released on March 12, 2006 by Lakeshore Records. In addition to Johnson's score, it contains songs by [[The Velvet Underground]], [[Anton Karas]] and Kay Armen as well as the big band version of "[[Frankie and Johnny (song)|Frankie and Johnny]]" performed by [[Bunny Berigan]] and a full unedited performance of "[[Wikisource:The Mikado/The sun whose rays are all ablaze|The sun whose rays are all ablaze]]" by [[Nora Zehetner]]. Johnson has confirmed that various elements in the film were influenced by ''[[Twin Peaks]]'' creator [[David Lynch]].&lt;ref name="deletedscenesrelated"/&gt;

==Home media==
The [[DVD region code#1|Region 1]] [[DVD]] release of ''Brick'' was released on August 8, 2006 as part of the [[Focus Features]] Spotlight Series. Special features include: selection of [[Deleted scene|deleted and extended scenes]] with introductions by Johnson; audition footage featuring Nora Zehetner and Noah Segan; and feature [[audio commentary]] with Rian Johnson, Nora Zehetner, Noah Segen, producer [[Ram Bergman]], production designer Jodie Tillen, and costume designer Michele Posch.

The [[DVD region code#2|Region 2]] DVD was released on September 18, 2006.

==Reception==

===Box office===
''Brick'' premiered in the United States on April 7, 2006, in two theaters. It opened to United Kingdom audiences on May 12, 2006 on a limited number of screens. According to the DVD commentary track, the film was made for just under $500,000. The film grossed [[United States dollar|US$]]2.07 million in North America and a total of $3.9 million worldwide.&lt;ref name= "boxoffice"/&gt;

===Critical response===
''Brick'' has an approval rating of  80% on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on 137 reviews and an average score of 7.1 out of 10. The consensus states: "This entertaining homage to noirs past has been slickly and compellingly updated to a contemporary high school setting."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/brick/ ''Brick''], [[Rotten Tomatoes]], accessed May 8, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; and ranked #35 on ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''{{'}}s list of the "50 Best High School Movies".&lt;ref name="high school"/&gt; Based on 34 reviews, [[Metacritic]] gave it an average score of 72 out of 100 ("Generally positive reviews").&lt;ref name="metacritic"/&gt;

[[Roger Ebert]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' gave the film three out of four stars, stating "[It works] in the sense that the classic Hollywood noirs worked: The story is never clear while it unfolds, but it provides a rich source of dialogue, behavior and incidents."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ebert|first=Roger|title=Brick|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060406/REVIEWS/60403003|publisher=Chicago Sun-Times|accessdate=5 December 2012|date=7 April 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film's only serious flaw, thought Ebert, was that the characters were not entirely believable and thus it was difficult to care about the outcome of events for the characters. [[Peter Travers]] of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' also gave the film a positive review, explaining "A spoof would have been easy. Instead, Johnson plunges off the deep end, risking ridicule by shaping this spellbinder with grit and gravitas."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Travers|first=Peter|title=Brick {{!}} Movie Reviews|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/reviews/brick-20060321|publisher=Rolling Stone|accessdate=5 December 2012|date=21 March 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Stephen Holden]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' commented, "Mr. Haas and Mr. Gordon-Levitt at least succeed in evoking the outlines of their characters. But the film's ham-handed reliance on period argot not only wears thin; it keeps the characters, such as they are, at a chilly distance."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Stephen|first=Holden|title=Brick - Reviews - Movies|url=https://movies.nytimes.com/2006/03/31/movies/31bric.html?_r=0|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=5 December 2012|date=31 March 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Brick'' ranks 489th on [[Empire (film magazine)|''Empire'' magazine's]] 2008 list of the 500 greatest movies of all time.&lt;ref name="empire"/&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; It has been prepared from [[MRI|diffusion MRI]] datasets of the [[Human Connectome Project]] into a reference connectome (or brain [[Chart|graph]]), which can be downloaded in CSV and GraphML formats and visualized on the site in 3D.

==Features==
The Budapest Reference Connectome has 1015 nodes, corresponding to anatomically identified gray matter areas. The user can set numerous parameters and the resulting consensus connectome is readily visualized on the webpage &lt;ref name="bpconn3"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;. Users can zoom, rotate, and query the anatomical label of the nodes on the graphical component.

==Background==

Budapest Reference Connectome is a consensus graph of the brain graphs of 96 subjects in Version 2 and 418 subjects in Version 3. Only those edges are returned which are present in a given percentage of the subjects. Each of the selected edges has a certain weight in each of the graphs containing that edge, so these multiple weights are combined into a single weight, by taking either their mean (i.e., average) or median. The user interface allows the customization of these parameters: the user can select the minimum frequency of the edges returned. There is an option for viewing and comparing the female or male reference connectomes. The connectomes of women contain significantly more edges than those of men, and a larger portion of the edges in the connectomes of women run between the two hemispheres.&lt;ref name="IngalhalikarSmith2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ingalhalikar|first1=M.|last2=Smith|first2=A.|last3=Parker|first3=D.|last4=Satterthwaite|first4=T.

==Discoveries==

The Budapest Reference Connectome has led the researchers to the discovery of the Consensus Connectome Dynamics of the human [[connectome|brain graphs]]. The edges appeared in all of the brain graphs form a connected subgraph around the [[brainstem]]. By allowing gradually less frequent edges, this core subgraph grows continuously, as a [[shrub]]. The growth dynamics may reflect the individual [[brain development]] and provide an opportunity to direct some edges of the human consensus brain graph.&lt;ref name="Kerepesi2016"&gt;

'''Bullying''' is the use of force, threat, or [[coercion]] to [[abuse]], [[intimidate]] or aggressively [[wikt:domination|dominate]] others. The behavior is often repeated and habitual. One essential prerequisite is the perception, by the bully or by others, of an imbalance of [[Power (social and political)|social]] or physical power, which distinguishes bullying from conflict.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Juvonen, J. |author2=Graham, S. | title =Bullying in Schools: The Power of Bullies and the Plight of Victims | journal =Annual Review of Psychology| volume =65 | publisher =Annual Reviews | date =2014| pages=159–85 | url =http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/full/10.1146/annurev-psych-010213-115030 | doi=10.1146/annurev-psych-010213-115030 | pmid=23937767}}&lt;/ref&gt; Behaviors used to assert such domination can include verbal [[harassment]] or [[threat]], physical [[assault]] or coercion, and such acts may be directed repeatedly towards particular targets. [[Rationalization (making excuses)|Rationalizations]] of such behavior sometimes include differences of social class, race, religion, gender, sexual orientation, appearance, behavior, body language, personality, reputation, lineage, strength, size or ability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title =Children who are bullying or being bullied | work =Cambridgeshire County Council: Children and families | publisher =Cambridgeshire County Council | date =2013-07-24 | url =http://www.cambridgeshire.gov.uk/childrenandfamilies/parenting/childsbehaviour/bullying.htm | accessdate =2013-10-28 | deadurl =yes | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20131029215401/http://www.cambridgeshire.gov.uk/childrenandfamilies/parenting/childsbehaviour/bullying.htm | archivedate =2013-10-29 | df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last =Ericson | first =Nels | title =Addressing the Problem of Juvenile Bullying | journal =OJJDP Fact Sheet #FS-200127 | volume =27 | publisher =U.S. Department of Justice: Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention | date =June 2001 | url =https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/ojjdp/fs200127.pdf | accessdate =2013-10-28 | deadurl =no | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20150626170748/https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/ojjdp/fs200127.pdf | archivedate =2015-06-26 | df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Meyer|first=Doug|date=|title=The Gentle Neoliberalism of Modern Anti-bullying Texts: Surveillance, Intervention, and Bystanders in Contemporary Bullying Discourse|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13178-016-0238-9|journal=Sexuality Research and Social Policy|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; If bullying is done by a group, it is called [[mobbing]].&lt;ref name="DavenportSchwartz1999"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Noa Davenport|author2=Ruth Distler Schwartz|author3=Gail Pursell Elliott|title=Mobbing: Emotional Abuse in the American Workplace|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JlJoyD84BfAC|accessdate=2013-10-28|date=1999-07-01|publisher=Civil Society Publishing|isbn=978-0-9671803-0-4|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140101074041/http://books.google.com/books?id=JlJoyD84BfAC|archivedate=2014-01-01|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bullying can be defined in many different ways. The United Kingdom has no legal definition of bullying,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title =The University of Manchester Dignity at Work and Study Policy | publisher =The University of Manchester | date =January 2012 | url =http://documents.manchester.ac.uk/display.aspx?DocID=2753 | accessdate =2013-10-28 | deadurl =no | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20131029210026/http://documents.manchester.ac.uk/display.aspx?DocID=2753 | archivedate =2013-10-29 | df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; while some states in the United States have laws against it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=State Laws Related to Bullying Among Children and Youth |work=U.S. Department of Health and Human Services - Health Resources and Services Administration - Maternal and Child Health Bureau |publisher=U.S. Department of Health and Human Services |url=http://stopbullyingnow.hrsa.gov/HHS_PSA/pdfs/SBN_Tip_6.pdf |accessdate=2013-10-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110304062718/http://www.stopbullyingnow.hrsa.gov/HHS_PSA/pdfs/SBN_Tip_6.pdf |archivedate=March 4, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bullying is divided into four basic types of abuse &amp;ndash; [[Psychological abuse|emotional]] (sometimes called relational), [[Verbal abuse|verbal]], [[Physical abuse|physical]], and cyber.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last =Brank | first =Eve M. | last2 =Hoetger | first2 =Lori A. | last3 =Hazen | first3 =Katherine P. | title =Bullying | journal =Annual Review of Law and Social Science | volume =8 | pages =213–230 | publisher =Annual Reviews | date =December 2012 | url =http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev-lawsocsci-102811-173820 | doi =10.1146/annurev-lawsocsci-102811-173820 | accessdate = 2013-10-28 | issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; It typically involves subtle methods of coercion, such as intimidation.

Bullying ranges from one-on-one, individual bullying through to group bullying called [[mobbing]], in which the bully may have one or more "lieutenants" who may seem to be willing to assist the primary bully in his or her bullying activities. Bullying in school and the workplace is also referred to as peer abuse.&lt;ref name="Bennett2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=Elizabeth Bennett|title=Peer Abuse Know More!: Bullying from a Psychological Perspective|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GF06aB7mLdIC|accessdate=2013-10-29|date=1 January 2006|publisher=Infinity|isbn=978-0-7414-3265-0|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140914150852/http://books.google.com/books?id=GF06aB7mLdIC|archivedate=14 September 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert W. Fuller]] has analyzed bullying in the context of [[rankism]].

A [[bullying culture]] can develop in any context in which humans interact with each other.

There is no universal definition of bullying, however, it is widely agreed upon that bullying is a subcategory of aggressive behavior characterized by the following three minimum criteria: (1) hostile intent, (2) imbalance of power and (3) repetition over a period of time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Burger |first=Christoph |last2=Strohmeier |first2=Dagmar |last3=Spröber |first3=Nina |last4=Bauman |first4=Sheri |last5=Rigby |first5=Ken |date=2015 |title=How teachers respond to school bullying: An examination of self-reported intervention strategy use, moderator effects, and concurrent use of multiple strategies |journal=Teaching and Teacher Education |pages=191–202 |doi=10.1016/j.tate.2015.07.004 |volume=51}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bullying may thus be defined as the activity of repeated, aggressive behavior intended to hurt another individual, physically, mentally or emotionally.

The Norwegian researcher Dan Olweus&lt;ref name="History"&gt;{{cite web | title =History | work =OLWEUS Bullying Prevention Program | publisher =OLWEUS Bullying Prevention Program | url =http://www.clemson.edu/olweus/history.html | accessdate =2013-10-28 | deadurl =no | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20131029204025/http://www.clemson.edu/olweus/history.html | archivedate =2013-10-29 | df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; says bullying occurs when a person is "exposed, repeatedly and over time, to negative actions on the part of one or more other persons". He says negative actions occur "when a person intentionally inflicts injury or discomfort upon another person, through physical contact, through words or in other ways."&lt;ref name="History" /&gt; Individual bullying is usually characterized by a person behaving in a certain way to gain [[Power (social and political)|power]] over another person.&lt;ref name="Besag1989"&gt;{{cite book|author=Valerie E.

== Types ==
Individual bullying can be classified into four types.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Invitation to the Life Span|last = Berger|first = Kathleen Stassen|publisher = Worth Publishers|year = 2014|isbn = 1464172056|location = New York|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Collective bullying is known as mobbing, and can include any of the individual types of bullying.

Physical, verbal, and relational bullying are most prevalent in primary school and could also begin much earlier whilst continuing into later stages in individuals lives. It is stated that Cyber-bullying is more common in secondary school than in primary school.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Individual ===
Individual bullying tactics can be perpetrated by a single person against a target or targets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://respect2all.org/bullying-definitions/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-02-26 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304140405/http://respect2all.org/bullying-definitions/ |archivedate=2016-03-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Physical ====
This is any bullying that hurts someone's body or damages their possessions. Stealing, shoving, hitting, fighting, and destroying property all are types of physical bullying. Physical bullying is rarely the first form of bullying that a target will experience. Often bullying will begin in a different form and later progress to physical violence. In physical bullying the main weapon the bully uses is their body when attacking their target. Sometimes groups of young adults will target and alienate a peer because of some adolescent prejudice. This can quickly lead to a situation where they are being taunted, tortured, and beaten-up by their classmates. Physical bullying will often escalate over time, and can lead to a tragic ending, and therefore must be stopped quickly to prevent any further escalation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://nobullying.com/physical-bullying/|title=no bullying|last=|first=|date=|website=nobullying.com/physical-bullying/|publisher=|access-date=30 November 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161201023450/https://nobullying.com/physical-bullying/|archivedate=1 December 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Verbal ====
This is any bullying that is conducted by speaking. Calling names, spreading rumors, threatening somebody, and making fun of others are all forms of verbal bullying. Verbal bullying is one of the most common types of bullying. In verbal bullying the main weapon the bully uses is their ''voice''. In many cases, verbal bullying is the province of girls. Girls are more subtle (and can be more devastating), in general, than boys. Girls use verbal bullying, as well as social exclusion techniques, to dominate and control other individuals and show their superiority and power. However, there are also many boys with subtlety enough to use verbal techniques for domination, and who are practiced in using words when they want to avoid the trouble that can come with physically bullying someone else.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.bullyingstatistics.org/content/verbal-bullying.html|title=What is Verbal Bullying and How to Handle Verbal Bullies - Bullying Statistics|date=2015-07-08|newspaper=Bullying Statistics|language=en-US|access-date=2016-11-30|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161125110622/http://www.bullyingstatistics.org/content/verbal-bullying.html|archivedate=2016-11-25|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Relational ====
This is any bullying that is done with the intent to hurt somebody's reputation or social standing which can also link in with the techniques included in physical and verbal bullying. Relational Bullying is a form of bullying common amongst youth, but particularly upon girls. Relational bullying can be used as a tool by bullies to both improve their social standing and control others. Unlike physical bullying which is obvious, relational bullying is not overt and can continue for a long time without being noticed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://antibullyingsoftware.com/what-is-the-definition-of-relational-bullying-social-bullying/|title=What is the Definition of Relational Bullying / Social Bullying  - BRIM Anti-Bullying Software|last=Norton|first=Chris|newspaper=BRIM Anti-Bullying Software|language=en-US|access-date=2016-11-30|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161201080421/https://antibullyingsoftware.com/what-is-the-definition-of-relational-bullying-social-bullying/|archivedate=2016-12-01|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Cyber-bullying ====
Cyber bullying is the use of technology to harass, threaten, embarrass, or target another person. When an adult is involved, it may meet the definition of '''cyber-harassment''' or '''cyberstalking''', a crime that can have legal consequences and involve jail time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://kidshealth.org/en/parents/cyberbullying.html|title=Cyberbullying|website=kidshealth.org|access-date=2016-11-30|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161201165708/http://kidshealth.org/en/parents/cyberbullying.html|archivedate=2016-12-01|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This includes email, instant messaging, social networking sites (such as Facebook), text messages, and cell phones.

=== Collective ===
Collective bullying tactics are employed by more than one individual against a target or targets. [[Internet troll|Trolling behavior]] on social media, although generally assumed to be individual in nature by the casual reader, is sometime organized efforts by sponsored [[astroturfing|astroturfers]].

==== Mobbing ====
{{Main|Mobbing}}
Mobbing refers to the bullying of an individual by a group, in any context, such as a [[family]], [[peer group]], [[school]], [[workplace]], [[neighborhood]], [[community]], or online. When it occurs as [[emotion]]al [[abuse]] in the workplace, such as "ganging up" by co-workers, [[Hierarchy|subordinate]]s or [[Superior (hierarchy)|superior]]s, to force someone out of the workplace through [[rumor]], [[innuendo]], [[intimidation]], [[humiliation]], [[discrediting]], and [[Isolation to facilitate abuse|isolation]], it is also referred to as malicious, nonsexual, nonracial / racial, general [[harassment]].&lt;ref&gt;Mobbing: Emotional Abuse in the American Workplace by Noa Davenport, Ruth D.

Dr. Cook says that "a typical bully has trouble resolving problems with others and also has trouble academically. He or she usually has negative attitudes and beliefs about others, feels negatively toward himself/herself, comes from a family environment characterized by conflict and poor parenting, perceives school as negative and is negatively influenced by peers".&lt;ref name="APS2010"&gt;{{cite journal | authorlink =  | title = Predictors of Bullying and Victimization in Childhood and Adolescence: A Meta-analytic Investigation | journal = School Psychology Quarterly | volume = 25 | issue = 2 | pages = 65–83 | publisher = American Psychological Association | year = 2010 | url = http://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/releases/spq-25-2-65.pdf | doi = 10.1037/a0020149 | accessdate = 2013-10-28 | last1 = Cook | first1 = Clayton R. | last2 = Williams | first2 = Kirk R. | last3 = Guerra | first3 = Nancy G. | last4 = Kim | first4 = Tia E. | last5 = Sadek | first5 = Shelly | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140307231300/http://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/releases/spq-25-2-65.pdf | archivedate = 2014-03-07 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contrarily, some researchers have suggested that some bullies are psychologically strongest and have high social standing among their peers, while their targets are emotionally distressed and socially marginalized.&lt;ref&gt;Juvonen (2003) [http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/112/6/1231.abstract ''Bullying Among Young Adolescents: The Strong, the Weak and the Troubled''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110818110341/http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/112/6/1231.abstract |date=2011-08-18 }} in ''Pediatrics'', December 2003, {{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peer groups often promote the bully's actions, and members of these peer groups also engage in behaviors, such as mocking, excluding, punching, and insulting one another as a source of entertainment.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Other researchers also argued that a minority of the bullies, those who are not in-turn bullied, enjoy going to school, and are least likely to take days off sick.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title ='Bullies are the healthiest pupils' | newspaper =BBC News | department =Education | publisher =BBC | date =1999-12-14 | url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/education/564923.stm | accessdate =2013-10-29 | deadurl =no | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20131030192122/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/education/564923.stm | archivedate =2013-10-30 | df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Of typical bystanders ===
Often, bullying takes place in the presence of a large group of relatively uninvolved bystanders. In many cases, it is the bully's ability to create the illusion that he or she has the support of the majority present that instills the fear of "speaking out" in protestation of the bullying activities being observed by the group. Unless the "bully mentality" is effectively challenged in any given group in its early stages, it often becomes an accepted, or supported, [[Norm (social)|norm]] within the group.&lt;ref name="bystander attitudes"&gt;{{cite web | title =Bullies, Victims, and Bystanders | work =athealth.com: Consumer: Issues | publisher =Athealth.com | url =http://www.athealth.com/Consumer/issues/BulliesVictimsBystanders3.html | accessdate =2013-10-29 | deadurl =no | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20140305091427/http://www.athealth.com/Consumer/issues/BulliesVictimsBystanders3.html | archivedate =2014-03-05 | df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title =New Tactics To Tackle Bystander's Role In Bullying | newspaper =Science Daily | department =Science News | publisher =Science Daily, LLC | date =2009-01-27 | url =https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/01/090125193150.htm | accessdate =2013-10-29 | deadurl =no | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20131029184804/https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/01/090125193150.htm | archivedate =2013-10-29 | df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unless action is taken, a "[[Bullying culture|culture of bullying]]" is often perpetuated within a group for months, years, or longer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title =419: Petty Tyrant | work =This American Life: Radio Archive | publisher =Chicago Public Media &amp; Ira Glass | date =2010-11-12 | url =http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/419/petty-tyrant | accessdate =2013-10-29 | deadurl =no | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20131010093611/http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/419/petty-tyrant | archivedate =2013-10-10 | df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bystanders who have been able to establish their own "friendship group" or "support group" have been found to be far more likely to opt to speak out against bullying behavior than those who have not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title =Pasco students get 'hero' training to stop bullying | newspaper =[[The Tampa Tribune]] | department =Pasco County | publisher =Tampa Media Group, LLC | date =2010-10-12 | url =http://tbo.com/pasco-county/pasco-students-get-hero-training-to-stop-bullying-24060 | accessdate =2013-10-29 | deadurl =no | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20140502001344/http://tbo.com/pasco-county/pasco-students-get-hero-training-to-stop-bullying-24060 | archivedate =2014-05-02 | df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | title =Program Helps Students Combat Bullying - Students participate with enthusiasm | journal =Winning Harmony Counselling | date =2010-10-04 | url =http://www.winningharmony.com/News_and_Events.php | accessdate =2013-10-29 | postscript =&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

In addition to communication of clear expectations that bystanders should intervene and increasing individual self-efficacy, there is growing research that suggests interventions should build on the foundation that bullying is morally wrong.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last =Thornberg | first =Robert | last2 =Tenenbaum | first2 =Laura | last3 =Varjas | first3 =Kris | last4 =Meyers | first4 =Joel | last5 =Jungert | first5 =Tomas | last6 =Vanegas | first6 =Gina | title =Bystander Motivation in Bullying Incidents: To Intervene or Not to Intervene? | journal =Western Journal of Emergency Medicine | volume =13 | issue =3 | pages =247–252 | date =August 2012 | language =  | doi =10.5811/westjem.2012.3.11792| pmc =3415829 | pmid =22900122}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among adults, being a bystander to workplace bullying was linked to depression, particularly in women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last =Jensen | first =I. B. | title =The impact of bystanding to workplace bullying on symptoms of depression among women and men in industry in Sweden: an empirical and theoretical longitudinal study | journal =International Archives of Occupational and Environmental Health | volume =86 | issue =6 | pages =709–716 | date =August 2013 | jstor = | issn =1432-1246 | doi =10.1007/s00420-012-0813-1 | first2 =A. | last3 =Hagberg | first3 =J. | last4 =Jensen | first4 =I.

=== Of victims ===
Dr. Cook says that "A typical victim is likely to be aggressive, lack social skills, think negative thoughts, experience difficulties in solving social problems, come from a negative family, school and community environments and be noticeably rejected and isolated by peers".&lt;ref name="APS2010"/&gt; Victims often have characteristics such as being physically weak, as well as being easily distraught emotionally. They may also have physical characteristics that make them easier targets for bullies such as being overweight or having some type of physical deformity. Boys are more likely to be victims of physical bullying while girls are more likely to be bullied indirectly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Paediatrics and Child Health|year= 2010 |volume=20 |issue=7|pages=315–320|last=Vanderbilt |first=Douglas |last2=Augustyn |first2=Marilyn |url =http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1751722210000715|title=The effects of bullying |doi=10.1016/j.paed.2010.03.008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The results of a [[meta-analysis]] conducted by Cook and published by the [[American Psychological Association]] in 2010 concluded the main risk factors for children and adolescents being bullied, and also for becoming bullies, are the lack of [[social problem-solving]] skills.&lt;ref name="APS2010"/&gt;

Children who are bullied often show physical or emotional signs, such as: being afraid to attend school, complaining of headaches or a loss of appetite, a lack of interest in school activities and spending time with friends or family, and having an overall sense of sadness.

While some people find it very easy to ignore a bully, others may find it very difficult and reach a breaking point. There have been cases of apparent bullying suicides that have been reported closely by the media. These include the deaths of [[Suicide of Ryan Halligan|Ryan Halligan]], [[Suicide of Phoebe Prince|Phoebe Prince]], [[Suicide of Dawn-Marie Wesley|Dawn-Marie Wesley]], [[Suicide of Nicola Ann Raphael|Nicola Ann Raphael]], [[Suicide of Megan Meier|Megan Meier]], [[Suicide of Audrie Pott|Audrie Pott]], [[Suicide of Tyler Clementi|Tyler Clementi]], [[Suicide of Jamey Rodemeyer|Jamey Rodemeyer]], [[Suicide of Kenneth Weishuhn|Kenneth Weishuhn]], [[Suicide of Jadin Bell|Jadin Bell]], [[Suicide of Kelly Yeomans|Kelly Yeomans]], [[Suicide of Rehtaeh Parsons|Rehtaeh Parsons]], [[Suicide of Amanda Todd|Amanda Todd]], [[Brodie's Law (act)|Brodie Panlock]],&lt;ref name="fine"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/men-who-tormented-suicide-waitress-brodie-panlock-fined/news-story/45a1de04af03cae09f0b6afc9ebd76c2 | title=Men who tormented suicide waitress Brodie Panlock fined |website=dailytelegraph.com.au | access-date=14 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jessica Haffer,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title =Jessica Kassandra Haffer | publisher =Keith &amp; Jeralyn Haffer | url =http://www.jessicahaffer.com/ | accessdate =2013-10-28 | deadurl =no | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20140104102027/http://jessicahaffer.com/ | archivedate =2014-01-04 | df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Suicide of Hamed Nastoh|Hamed Nastoh]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title =Hamed Nastoh | url =http://www.angelfire.com/bc2/hamed/ | accessdate =2013-10-28 | deadurl =no | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20131029222924/http://www.angelfire.com/bc2/hamed/ | archivedate =2013-10-29 | df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Suicide of Sladjana Vidovic|Sladjana Vidovic]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.clevescene.com/scene-and-heard/archives/2010/08/23/family-of-sladjana-vidovic-16-year-old-who-committed-suicide-suing-mentor-schools|title=Family of Sladjana Vidovic, 16-Year-Old Who Committed Suicide, Suing Mentor Schools|last=Grzegorek|first=Vince|date=2010-08-23|website=|access-date=2018-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; April Himes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last =Caruso | first =Kevin | title =April Himes Memorial | work =Suicide.org | publisher =Suicide.org | url =http://www.suicide.org/memorials/april-himes.html | accessdate =2013-10-28 | deadurl =no | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20121227145112/http://www.suicide.org/memorials/april-himes.html | archivedate =2012-12-27 | df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cherice Moralez&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last =McLaughlin | first =Elliot C. | title =Montana teen loved pit bulls, poetry before rape and suicide | work =CNN | department =U.S. | publisher =Cable News Network | date =2013-08-30 | url =http://edition.cnn.com/2013/08/30/us/montana-teacher-rape-victim-profile/index.html | accessdate =2013-10-29 | deadurl =no | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20131017010102/http://edition.cnn.com/2013/08/30/us/montana-teacher-rape-victim-profile/index.html | archivedate =2013-10-17 | df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Suicide of Rebecca Ann Sedwick|Rebecca Ann Sedwick]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last =Pearce | first =Matt | title =Florida girl, 12, found dead after bullies said 'kill yourself' | newspaper =Los Angeles Times | department =U.S.: Nation Now | publisher =Los Angeles Times | date =2013-09-12 | url =http://www.latimes.com/nation/nationnow/la-na-nn-florida-cyberbullying-20130912,0,1429218.story#axzz2j8q54wL8 | accessdate =2013-10-29 | deadurl =no | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20131030125706/http://www.latimes.com/nation/nationnow/la-na-nn-florida-cyberbullying-20130912%2C0%2C1429218.story#axzz2j8q54wL8 | archivedate =2013-10-30 | df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the suicide awareness voices for education, suicide is one of the leading causes of death for youth from 15 to 24 years old.

=== Positive development ===
Some have argued that bullying can teach life lessons and instill strength. Helene Guldberg, a child development academic, sparked controversy when she argued that being a target of bullying can teach a child "how to manage disputes and boost their ability to interact with others", and that teachers should not intervene, but leave children to respond to the bullying themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author =Tanya | title =Child Development Academician Says Bullying Is Beneficial To Kids | work =Med India | department =News | publisher =Medindia | date =2009-02-02 | url =http://www.medindia.net/news/Child-Development-Academician-Says-Bullying-Is-Beneficial-To-Kids-46992-1.htm | accessdate =2013-10-29 | deadurl =no | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20131101060052/http://www.medindia.net/news/Child-Development-Academician-Says-Bullying-Is-Beneficial-To-Kids-46992-1.htm | archivedate =2013-11-01 | df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The teaching of such anti-bullying coping skills to "would-be-targets"{{Failed verification|date=May 2018}} and to others has been found to be an effective long term means of reducing bullying incidence rates and a valuable skill-set for individuals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.careforkids.com.au/childcarenews/2010/july/bullying.html Positive Anti-Bullying Strategies by Melissa Graham] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131110160827/http://www.careforkids.com.au/childcarenews/2010/july/bullying.html |date=2013-11-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Dark triad ==
{{Main|Dark triad}}
Research on the dark triad ([[narcissism]], [[Machiavellianism]] and [[psychopathy]]) indicate a correlation with bullying as part of evidence of the aversive nature of those traits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Chabrol H. |author2=Van Leeuwen N. |author3=Rodgers R. |author4=Séjourné S.| year = 2009 | title = Contributions of psychopathic, narcissistic, Machiavellian, and sadistic personality traits to juvenile delinquency|journal = Personality and Individual Differences|volume =47|issue=7|pages=734–39|doi=10.1016/j.paid.2009.06.020 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Projection ==
{{Main|Psychological projection}}
A bully may project his/her own feelings of vulnerability onto the target(s) of the bullying activity. Despite the fact that a bully's typically denigrating activities are aimed at the bully's targets, the true source of such negativity is ultimately almost always found in the bully's own sense of personal insecurity and/or vulnerability.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Gilbert, ''Overcoming Depression'' (1999) p.&amp;nbsp;185–6&lt;/ref&gt; Such aggressive projections of displaced negative emotions can occur anywhere from the micro-level of interpersonal relationships, all the way up through to the macro-level of international politics, or even international armed conflict.&lt;ref name="micro and macro projection"&gt;Carl G. Jung ed., ''Man and his Symbols'' (London 1978) p.&amp;nbsp;181–2&lt;/ref&gt;

== Emotional intelligence ==
{{Main|Bullying and emotional intelligence}}
Bullying is abusive social interaction between peers which can include aggression, harassment, and violence. Bullying is typically repetitive and enacted by those who are in a position of [[Abusive power and control|power]] over the victim. A growing body of research illustrates a significant relationship between bullying and [[emotional intelligence]] (EI). [[John D. Mayer|Mayer]] et al., (2008) defines the dimensions of overall EI as: "accurately perceiving emotion, using emotions to facilitate thought, understanding emotion, and managing emotion".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mayer | first1 = J.D. | last2 = Roberts | first2 = R.D | last3 = Barasade | first3 = S.G. | year = 2008 | title = Human abilities: Emotional intelligence | url = | journal = Annual Review of Psychology | volume = 59 | issue = 1| pages = 507–536 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.psych.59.103006.093646 | pmid = 17937602 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept combines emotional and intellectual processes.&lt;ref name="Tolegenova"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1016/j.sbspro.2012.12.142|title = A Theoretical Formation of Emotional Intelligence and Childhood Trauma among Adolescents| journal=Procedia - Social and Behavioral Sciences| volume=69| pages=1891–1894|year = 2012|last1 = Tolegenova|first1 = A.A.| last2=Jakupov| first2=S.M.| last3=Chung| first3=Man Cheung| last4=Saduova| first4=S.| last5=Jakupov| first5=M.S.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lower emotional intelligence appears to be related to involvement in bullying, as the bully and/or the victim of bullying. EI seems to play an important role in both bullying behavior and [[victimization]] in bullying; given that EI is illustrated to be malleable, EI education could greatly improve bullying prevention and intervention initiatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mckenna | first1 = J. | last2 = Webb | first2 = J. | year = 2013 | title = Emotional intelligence | url = | journal = British Journal of Occupational Therapy | volume = 76 | issue = 12| page = 560 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Context ==
=== Cyberbullying ===
{{Main|Cyberbullying}}
Cyberbullying is any bullying done through the use of technology. This form of bullying can easily go undetected because of lack of parental/authoritative supervision. Because bullies can pose as someone else, it is the most anonymous form of bullying. Cyberbullying includes, but is not limited to, abuse using email, instant messaging, text messaging, websites, social networking sites, etc.&lt;ref name="BoltonGraeve2005"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jose Bolton|author2=Stan Graeve|title=No Room for Bullies: From the Classroom to Cyberspace|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WOUWBckRIBIC|accessdate=2013-10-29|year=2005|publisher=Boys Town Press|isbn=978-1-889322-67-4|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140101120429/http://books.google.com/books?id=WOUWBckRIBIC|archivedate=2014-01-01|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the creation of social networks like [[Facebook]], [[Myspace]], [[Instagram]], and [[Twitter]], cyberbullying has increased.

There is an additional problem that those with learning disabilities are often not as able to explain things to other people, so are more likely to be disbelieved or ignored if they do complain.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

=== Gay bullying ===
{{Main|Gay bashing}}
Gay bullying and gay bashing designate direct or indirect [[verbal abuse|verbal]] or [[physical abuse|physical]] actions by a person or group against someone who is gay or lesbian, or perceived to be so due to rumors or because they are considered to fit gay stereotypes. Gay and lesbian youth are more likely than straight youth to report bullying.&lt;ref name="Berlan et al., 2010"&gt;{{cite journal | last =Berlan | first =Elise D. | last2 =Corliss | first2 =Heather L. | last3 =Field | first3 =Alison E. | last4 =Goodman | first4 =Elizabeth | last5 =Austin | first5 =S.

=== Legal bullying ===
{{Main|Legal abuse}}
Legal bullying is the bringing of a [[Vexatious litigation|vexatious legal action]] to control and punish a person. Legal bullying can often take the form of frivolous, repetitive, or burdensome lawsuits brought to intimidate the defendant into submitting to the litigant's request, not because of the legal merit of the litigant's position, but principally due to the defendant's inability to maintain the legal battle. This can also take the form of [[Strategic Lawsuit Against Public Participation]] (SLAPP). It was partially concern about the potential for this kind of abuse that helped to fuel the [[protests against SOPA and PIPA]] in the United States in 2011 and 2012.

=== Military bullying ===
{{Main|Bullying in the military}}
In 2000, the UK [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]] (MOD) defined bullying as "the use of physical strength or the [[abuse of authority]] to intimidate or victimize others, or to give unlawful punishments".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Dannatt | first =Sir Richard | title =Values and Standards of the British Army | chapter =Lawful: Paragraph 20 | publisher =the British Army | year =2008 | url =http://www.army.mod.uk/documents/general/v_s_of_the_british_army.pdf | accessdate =2013-10-29 | deadurl =yes | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20130817150435/http://www.army.mod.uk/documents/general/v_s_of_the_british_army.pdf | archivedate =2013-08-17 | df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some argue that this behaviour should be allowed, due to ways in which "soldiering" is different from other occupations. Soldiers expected to risk their lives should, according to them, develop strength of body and spirit to accept bullying.&lt;ref name="CallaghanKernic2003"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jean M.

=== Parental bullying of children ===
{{See also|Child abuse|Narcissistic parent|Parental narcissistic abuse}}
Parents who may [[Displacement (psychology)|displace]] their anger, insecurity, or a persistent need to dominate and [[Abusive power and control|control]] upon their children in excessive ways have been proven to increase the likelihood that their own children will in turn become overly aggressive or controlling towards their peers.&lt;ref name="parent bullying"&gt;{{cite web | last =Priesnitz | first =Wendy | title =Parental Bullying Creates Bullies | work =Natural Child Magazine | publisher =Wendy Priesnitz | url =http://www.naturalchildmagazine.com/news/parental_bullying_creates_bullies.htm | accessdate =2013-10-29 | deadurl =no | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20131031134551/http://www.naturalchildmagazine.com/news/parental_bullying_creates_bullies.htm | archivedate =2013-10-31 | df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[American Psychological Association]] advises on its website that parents who may suspect that their own children may be engaging in bullying activities among their peers should carefully consider the examples which they themselves may be setting for their own children regarding how they typically interact with their own peers, colleagues, and children.&lt;ref name = "APA on parental bullying"&gt;{{cite web | title =Bullying: How parents, teachers, and kids can take action to prevent bullying | work =American Psychological Association | publisher =American Psychological Association | url = http://www.apa.org/helpcenter/bullying.aspx# | accessdate = 2013-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Prison bullying ===
{{Main|Prisoner abuse}}
An environment known for bullying is in prisons. An additional complication is the staff and their relationships with the inmates. Thus the following possible bullying scenarios are possible:
* Inmate bullies inmate (echoing school bullying)
* Staff bullies inmate
* Staff bullies staff (a manifestation of workplace bullying)
* Inmate bullies staff

=== School bullying (bullying of students in schools) ===
{{Main|School bullying}}
Bullying can occur in nearly any part in or around the school building, although it may occur more frequently during physical education classes and activities such as recess. Bullying also takes place in school hallways, bathrooms, on school buses and while waiting for buses, and in classes that require group work and/or after school activities. Bullying in school sometimes consists of a group of students taking advantage of or isolating one student in particular and gaining the loyalty of bystanders who want to avoid becoming the next target. In the 2011 documentary [[Bully (2011 film)|''Bully'']], we see first hand the torture that kids go through both in school and while on the school bus. As the movie follows around a few kids we see how bullying affects them both at school as well as in their homes. While bullying has no age limit, these bullies may taunt and tease their target before finally physically bullying them. Bystanders typically choose to either participate or watch, sometimes out of fear of becoming the next target.

Bullying can also be perpetrated by teachers and the school system itself; there is an inherent power differential in the system that can easily predispose to subtle or covert abuse ([[relational aggression]] or [[passive aggression]]), [[humiliation]], or exclusion — even while maintaining overt commitments to anti-bullying policies.&lt;ref name="GarbarinodeLara2003"&gt;{{cite book|author1=James Garbarino|author2=Ellen deLara|title=And Words Can Hurt Forever: How to Protect Adolescents from Bullying, Harassment, and Emotional Violence|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3XPx-OLgQjQC|accessdate=2013-10-29|date=2 September 2003|publisher=Free Press|isbn=978-0-7432-2899-2|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140101120850/http://books.google.com/books?id=3XPx-OLgQjQC|archivedate=1 January 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last =Witted | first =Kathryn Suzanne | title =Student Reports of Physical and Psychological Maltreatment in Schools: An Under Explored Aspect of Student Victimization in Schools | work =PhD dissertation, University of Tennessee | year =2005 | url =http://trace.tennessee.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3874&amp;context=utk_graddiss | accessdate =2013-10-29 | deadurl =no | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20131031121558/http://trace.tennessee.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3874&amp;context=utk_graddiss | archivedate =2013-10-31 | df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1177/0013124507304487 |title=Do Teachers Bully Students?: Findings From a Survey of Students in an Alternative Education Setting |year=2007 |last1=Whitted |first1=K.

In 2016, in Canada, a North American legal precedent was set by a mother and her son, after the son was bullied in his public school. The mother and son won a court case against the Ottawa-Carleton District School Board, making this the first case in North America where a school board has been found negligent in a bullying case for failing to meet the standard of care (the "duty of care" that the school board owes to its students). Thus, it sets a precedent of a school board being found liable in negligence for harm caused to a child, because they failed to protect a child from the bullying actions of other students. There has been only one other similar bullying case and it was won in Australia in 2013 (Oyston v. St. Patricks College, 2013).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ottawacommunitynews.com/news-story/6773614-family-wins-precedent-setting-case-against-public-school-board/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-07-22 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170210080755/http://www.ottawacommunitynews.com/news-story/6773614-family-wins-precedent-setting-case-against-public-school-board/ |archivedate=2017-02-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sexual bullying ===
{{Main|Sexual bullying}}
{{See also|Slut-shaming}}
Sexual bullying is "Any bullying behaviour, whether physical or non-physical, that is based on a person's sexuality or gender. It is when sexuality or gender is used as a weapon by boys or girls towards other boys or girls – although it is more commonly directed at girls. It can be carried out to a person's face, behind their back or through the use of technology."&lt;ref name=NSPCC02&gt;{{cite web |url=http://w1.qehs.net/moodle2/pluginfile.php/10744/mod_resource/content/1/Sexual%20bullying.pdf |title=The NSPCC working definition of Sexual Bullying |publisher=[[National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children|NSPCC]] |accessdate=13 September 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220065205/http://w1.qehs.net/moodle2/pluginfile.php/10744/mod_resource/content/1/Sexual%20bullying.pdf |archivedate=20 December 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Trans bullying ===
{{Main|Trans bashing}}
'''Trans bashing''' is the act of [[victimizing]] a person physically, sexually, or verbally because they are [[transgender]] or [[Transsexualism|transsexual]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0,21985,20774504-5005961,00.html Guilty plea over transsexual bashing] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080502173830/http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0%2C21985%2C20774504-5005961%2C00.html |date=2008-05-02 }} By Mariza O'Keefe in ''Herald Sun''&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike [[gay bashing]], it is committed because of the target's actual or perceived [[gender identity]], not [[sexual orientation]].

=== Workplace bullying ===
{{Main|Workplace bullying}}
Workplace bullying occurs when an employee experiences a persistent pattern of mistreatment from others in the workplace that causes harm.&lt;ref&gt;Rayner, C. &amp; Keashley, L. (2005). Bullying at work: A perspective from Britain and North America. In S. Fox &amp; P. E. Spector (eds.) Counterproductive work behavior: Investigations of actors and targets (pp. 271-296). Washington DC: American Psychological Association.&lt;/ref&gt; Workplace bullying can include such tactics as [[verbal abuse|verbal]], [[nonverbal]], [[psychological abuse|psychological]], [[physical abuse|physical]] abuse and [[humiliation]]. This type of [[workplace aggression]] is particularly difficult because, unlike the typical forms of [[school bullying]], workplace bullies often operate within the established rules and policies of their organization and their society. Bullying in the workplace is in the majority of cases reported as having been perpetrated by someone in authority over the target. However, bullies can also be peers, and occasionally can be subordinates.&lt;ref&gt;Rayner, C., &amp; Cooper, C. L. (2006). Workplace Bullying. In Kelloway, E., Barling, J. &amp; Hurrell Jr., J. (eds.), Handbook of workplace violence (pp. 47-90). Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first known documented use of "workplace bullying" is in 1992 in a book by [[Andrea Adams]] called ''Bullying at Work: How to Confront and Overcome It''.&lt;ref&gt;
[https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=workplace+bullying&amp;case_insensitive=on&amp;year_start=1990&amp;year_end=2008&amp;corpus=15&amp;smoothing=3&amp;share=&amp;direct_url=t4%3B%2Cworkplace%20bullying%3B%2Cc0%3B%2Cs0%3B%3Bworkplace%20bullying%3B%2Cc0%3B%3BWorkplace%20Bullying%3B%2Cc0%3B%3BWorkplace%20bullying%3B%2Cc0 Google ngrams]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Andrea Adams|Adams, Andrea]] with contributions from Crawford, Neil ''Bullying at Work: How to Confront and Overcome It'' (1992)&lt;/ref&gt;

Research has also investigated the impact of the larger organizational context on bullying as well as the group-level processes that impact on the incidence, and maintenance of bullying behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Ramsay, S., Troth, A &amp; Branch, S . (2010). Work-place bullying: A group processes framework ''Journal of Occupational and Organizational Psychology, 84(4), 799-816.''&lt;/ref&gt; Bullying can be covert or overt. It may be missed by superiors or known by many throughout the organization. Negative effects are not limited to the targeted individuals, and may lead to a decline in [[employee morale]] and a change in [[organizational culture]].&lt;ref name="SilentEpidemic" /&gt; A [[Cochrane (organisation)|Cochrane Collaboration]] [[systematic review]] has found very low quality [[Scientific evidence|evidence]] to suggest that organizational and individual interventions may prevent bullying behaviors in the workplace.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD009778.pub2/abstract|title=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|last=Gillen|first=Patricia A|last2=Sinclair|first2=Marlene|last3=Kernohan|first3=W George|last4=Begley|first4=Cecily M|last5=Luyben|first5=Ans G|date=2017-01-30|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd|issn=1465-1858|language=en|doi=10.1002/14651858.cd009778.pub2/full|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170307203800/http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD009778.pub2/abstract|archivedate=2017-03-07|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== In academia ====
{{Main|Bullying in academia}}
Bullying in academia is workplace bullying of scholars and staff in academia, especially places of higher education such as colleges and universities. It is believed to be common, although has not received as much attention from researchers as bullying in some other contexts.&lt;ref&gt;

==== In blue collar jobs ====
Bullying has been identified as prominent in blue collar jobs, including on oil rigs and in mechanic shops and machine shops. It is thought that intimidation and fear of retribution cause decreased incident reports. In industry sectors dominated by males, typically of little education, where disclosure of incidents are seen as effeminate, reporting in the socioeconomic and cultural milieu of such industries would likely lead to a [[vicious circle]]. This is often used in combination with [[psychological manipulation|manipulation]] and [[coercion]] of facts to gain favour among higher-ranking [[administrator (business)|administrators]].&lt;ref&gt;

==== In the legal profession ====
{{Main|Bullying in the legal profession}}
Bullying in the [[legal profession]] is believed to be more common than in some other professions. It is believed that its adversarial, hierarchical tradition contributes towards this.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unswlawjournal.unsw.edu.au/sites/default/files/t1_le_mire_and_owens.pdf Le Mire, Suzanne; Owens, Rosemary ''A propitious moment?: Workplace bullying and regulation of the legal profession'' University of New South Wales Law Journal, The Volume 37 Issue 3 (Dec 2014)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150201001112/http://www.unswlawjournal.unsw.edu.au/sites/default/files/t1_le_mire_and_owens.pdf |date=2015-02-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Women, trainees and solicitors who have been qualified for five years or less are more impacted, as are ethnic minority lawyers and lesbian, gay and bisexual lawyers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.journalonline.co.uk/News/1009923.aspx#.VMfxpyzp-24 Society publishes guidance on tackling bullying in solicitor profession] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150201001313/http://www.journalonline.co.uk/News/1009923.aspx |date=2015-02-01 }} The Journal of the Law Society of Scotland 27 June 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==== In medicine ====
{{Main|Bullying in medicine}}
Bullying in the [[medical profession]] is common, particularly of student or trainee doctors and of nurses. It is thought that this is at least in part an outcome of conservative traditional hierarchical structures and teaching methods in the medical profession, which may result in a bullying cycle.

==== In nursing ====
{{Main|Bullying in nursing}}
Even though The [[American Nurses Association]] believes that all nursing personnel have the right to work in safe, non-abusive environments, bullying has been identified as being particularly prevalent in the nursing profession although the reasons are not clear. It is thought that relational aggression (psychological aspects of bullying such as gossipping and intimidation) are relevant. Relational aggression has been studied among girls but not so much among adult women.&lt;ref name="RichardsEdwards2008"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nursingworld.org/Bullying-Workplace-Violence Workplace Violence Statistics {{cite journal | last =Dellasega | first =Cheryl A. | title =Bullying Among Nurses | journal =American Journal of Nursing | volume =109 | issue =1 | pages =52–58 | publisher =Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins | year =2009 | url =http://journals.lww.com/ajnonline/Abstract/2009/01000/Bullying_Among_Nurses.28.aspx | doi =10.1097/01.NAJ.0000344039.11651.08 | accessdate =2013-10-28 | pmid =19112267 | deadurl =no | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20131031224030/http://journals.lww.com/ajnonline/Abstract/2009/01000/Bullying_Among_Nurses.28.aspx | archivedate =2013-10-31 | df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== In teaching ====
{{Main|Bullying in teaching}}
[[School]] [[teachers]] are commonly the subject of bullying but they are also sometimes the originators of bullying within a school environment.

=== In other areas ===
As the verb ''to bully'' is defined as simply "forcing one's way aggressively or by intimidation", the term may generally apply to any life experience where one is motivated primarily by intimidation instead of by more positive goals, such as mutually shared interests and benefits. As such, any figure of authority or power who may use intimidation as a primary means of motivating others, such as a neighborhood "protection racket don", a national dictator, a childhood ring-leader, a terrorist, a terrorist organization, or even a ruthless business CEO, could rightfully be referred to as a bully. According to psychologist Pauline Rennie-Peyton, we each face the possibility of being bullied in any phase of our lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last =Karim | first =Nadiya | title =Bullying in Universities: It exists | newspaper =The Independent | department =News: Education: Higher | publisher =The Independent | date =2010-01-15 | url =https://www.independent.co.uk/news/education/higher/bullying-in-universities-it-exists-1869267.html | accessdate =2013-10-29 | deadurl =no | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20131216063925/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/education/higher/bullying-in-universities-it-exists-1869267.html | archivedate =2013-12-16 | df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Inanimate objects ===
Children have been observed bullying anthropomorphic robots designed to assist the elderly. Their attacks start with blocking the robots' paths of movement and then escalate to verbal abuse, hitting and destroying the object. Seventy-five percent of the kids interviewed perceived the robot as "human-like" yet decided to abuse it anyway, while 35% of the kids who beat up the robot actually did so "for enjoyment.".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/kids-attack-bully-robot-japanese-mall-danger-avoidance-ai-2015-8?IR=T|title=Scientists are teaching robots to avoid children — because kids can be surprisingly mean|work=Business Insider|access-date=2017-11-02|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Responding to bullying ==
Bullying is typically ongoing and not isolated behaviour. Common ways that people try to respond, are to try to ignore it, to confront the bullies or to turn to an authority figure to try and address it.

Ignoring it often does nothing to stop the bullying continuing, and it can become worse over time.&lt;ref&gt;W. Craig et al., [http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0143034307084136 "Responding to bullying, what works"]&lt;/ref&gt;
It can be important to address bullying behaviour early on, as it can be easier to control the earlier it is detected.&lt;ref&gt;W. Ci, [https://carleton.ca/economics/wp-content/uploads/bullying_paper_1-6.pdf "What can be done to stop bullying among children? Evidence from Canada"]&lt;/ref&gt;
Bystanders play an important role in responding to bullying, as doing nothing can encourage it to continue, while small steps that oppose the behaviour can reduce it.&lt;ref&gt;Bully-zero Australia Foundation, [http://bzaf.org.au/respond-to-bullying/ "Respond to bullying"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Authority figures can play an important role, such as parents in child or adolescent situations, or supervisors, human-resources staff or parent-bodies in workplace and volunteer settings. Authority figures can be influential in recognising and stopping bullying behaviour, and creating an environment where it doesn't continue.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.stopbullying.gov/respond/on-the-spot/index.html "Stop bullying on the spot"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Safe work Australia, [https://www.safeworkaustralia.gov.au/doc/guide-preventing-and-responding-workplace-bullying "Guide for preventing and responding to workplace bullying"]&lt;/ref&gt;
In many situations however people acting as authority figures are untrained and unqualified, do not know how to respond, and can make the situation worse.&lt;ref&gt;Veronica Birkett, [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/education/education-news/bullied-dont-tell-the-teacher-1361862.html "Bullied? Don't tell the teacher"]&lt;/ref&gt;
In some cases the authority figures even support the people doing the bullying, facilitating it continuing and increasing the isolation and marginalising of the target.&lt;ref&gt;[https://ethicsinvolunteering.wordpress.com/responding-to-bullying-in-arc-unsw-sports/ "Responding to bullying in Arc UNSW sports"]&lt;/ref&gt;
Some of the most effective ways to respond, are to recognise that harmful behaviour is taking place, and creating an environment where it won't continue.&lt;ref name=field03&gt;E. Field, [http://www.aph.gov.au/parliamentary_business/committees/house_of_representatives_committees?url=ee/bullying/subs/sub58.pdf "The prevalence of workplace bullying in Australia"]&lt;/ref&gt;
People that are being targeted have little control over which authority figures they can turn to and how such matters would be addressed, however one means of support is to find a counsellor or psychologist that is trained in handling bullying.

== Etymology ==
The word "[[bully]]" was first used in the 1530s meaning "sweetheart", applied to either sex, from the Dutch ''boel'' "lover, brother", probably diminutive of [[Middle High German]] ''buole'' "brother", of uncertain origin (compare with the German ''buhle'' "lover"). The meaning deteriorated through the 17th century through "fine fellow", "blusterer", to "harasser of the weak". This may have been as a connecting sense between "lover" and "ruffian" as in "protector of a prostitute", which was one sense of "bully" (though not specifically attested until 1706). The verb "to bully" is first attested in 1710.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title =bully | work =Online Etymology Dictionary | publisher =Douglas Harper | url =http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=bully | accessdate =2013-10-28 | deadurl =no | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20131029195402/http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=bully | archivedate =2013-10-29 | df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the past, in American culture, the term has been used differently, as an exclamation/exhortation, in particular famously associated with [[Theodore Roosevelt]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shapell.org/manuscript/theodore-roosevelt-bully-for-you ''TR Correspondence 27 September 1907''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160416024951/http://www.shapell.org/manuscript/theodore-roosevelt-bully-for-you |date=16 April 2016 }} "bully for you" in the positive sense&lt;/ref&gt; and continuing to the present in the [[bully pulpit]] and also as faint/deprecating praise ("bully for him").

In [[Christian theology]], [[Hell]] is the place or state into which by God's definitive judgment [[repentance|unrepentant]] [[sin]]ners pass either immediately after death ([[particular judgment]]) or in the [[general judgment]].&lt;ref name="Hell"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=fUqcAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA753 Cross, F. L., Livingstone, E. (editors), ''The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church'' (Oxford University Press. 2005), article "Hell"]&lt;/ref&gt; Its character is inferred from teaching in the biblical texts, some of which, interpreted literally, have given rise to the popular idea of [[Hell]].&lt;ref name="Hell"/&gt;

Theologians today generally see Hell as the logical consequence of using [[free will]] to reject union with God and, because God will not force conformity, not incompatible with God's justice and mercy.&lt;ref name="Hell"/&gt;

Different Hebrew and Greek words are translated as "[[Hell]]" in most English-language Bibles. They include:

* "[[Sheol]]" in the [[Hebrew Bible]], and "[[Christian views on Hades|Hades]]" in the [[New Testament]]. Many modern versions, such as the [[New International Version]], translate Sheol as "grave" and simply transliterate "Hades". It is generally agreed that both ''sheol'' and ''hades'' do not typically refer to the place of eternal punishment, but to the grave, the temporary abode of the dead, the [[underworld]].&lt;ref&gt;''New Bible Dictionary'' third edition, IVP 1996. Articles on "Hell", "Sheol".&lt;/ref&gt;
* "[[Gehenna#New Testament|Gehenna]]" in the New Testament, where it is described as a place where both [[soul]] and body could be destroyed ({{Bibleref2|Matthew|10:28|KJV}}) in "unquenchable fire" ({{Bibleref2|Mark|9:43|KJV}}). The word is translated as either "Hell" or "Hell fire" in many English versions.&lt;ref&gt;noted([[Revised Standard Version|RSV]] mg. "Gehenna": in Mk. 9:47)&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Greek verb "[[Tartarus#New Testament|ταρταρῶ (''tartarō'')]]", which occurs once in the New Testament (in {{Bibleref2|2Peter|2:4|KJV|2&amp;nbsp; Peter&amp;nbsp;2:4}}), is almost always translated by a phrase such as "thrown down to hell". A few translations render it as "Tartarus"; of this term, the [[Holman Christian Standard Bible]] states: "''Tartarus'' is a Greek name for a subterranean place of divine punishment lower than Hades."{{Bibleref2c|2Peter|2:4|HCSB|2&amp;nbsp; Peter&amp;nbsp;2:4}}

== Jewish background ==
[[File:Jheronimus Bosch 115 inner wings.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Hell (on the right) is portrayed in this 16th-century [[Hieronymus Bosch]] painting.]]
{{Main article|Sheol|Gehenna}}

In ancient [[Judaism|Jewish]] belief, the dead were consigned to ''Sheol'', a place to which all were sent indiscriminately (cf. {{Bibleref2|Genesis|37:35}}; {{Bibleref2|Numbers|16:30-33}}; {{Bibleref2|Psalm|86:13}}; {{Bibleref2|Ecclesiastes|9:10}}). ''Sheol'' was thought of as a place situated below the ground (cf. {{Bibleref2|Ezek.|31:15}}), a place of darkness, silence and forgetfulness (cf. Job 10:21).&lt;ref&gt;[https://clas-pages.uncc.edu/james-tabor/ancient-judaism/death-afterlife-future/ "What the Bible says about Death, Afterlife, and the Future"] James Tabor&lt;/ref&gt; By the third to second century BC, the idea had grown to encompass separate divisions in ''sheol'' for the righteous and wicked (cf. the [[Book of Enoch]]),&lt;ref name="NBDsheol"&gt;''New Bible Dictionary'' 3rd edition, IVP Leicester 1996. "Sheol".&lt;/ref&gt; and by the time of Jesus, some Jews had come to believe that those in Sheol awaited the [[resurrection of the dead]] either in comfort (in the [[bosom of Abraham]]) or in torment.

By at least the late rabbinical period, ''Gehinnom'' was viewed as the place of ultimate punishment, exemplified by the rabbinical statement "the best of physicians are destined to Gehinnom." (M. [[Nashim|Kiddushin]] 4:14); also described in [[Assumption of Moses]] and [[2 Esdras]].&lt;ref name="NBDhell"&gt;''New Bible Dictionary'' 3rd edition, IVP Leicester 1996, "Hell".&lt;/ref&gt; The term is derived from ''[[valley of Ge-Hinnom|Gei Ben-Hinnom]]'', a valley near [[Jerusalem]] originally used as a location for human sacrifices to the idol [[Moloch]]:

{{quotation|And he defiled the Tophet, which is in the valley of Ben-hinnom, that no man might make his son or his daughter pass through the fire to Molech.|{{Bibleref2|2Kings|23:10|NIV|2&amp;nbsp;Kings&amp;nbsp;23:10}}}}

{{quotation|And they built the high places of the Ba‘al, which are in the valley of Ben-hinnom, to cause their sons and their daughters to pass through the fire to Molech; which I did not command them, nor did it come into my mind that they should do this abomination, to cause Judah to sin.|{{Bibleref2|Jeremiah|32:35|NIV}}}}

In the Greek [[Septuagint]] the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] word ''Sheol'' was translated as ''[[Christian views on Hades|Hades]]'', the name for the [[Greek underworld|underworld and abode of the dead]] in [[Greek mythology]]. The realm of eternal punishment in Hellenistic mythology was ''[[Tartarus]]'', ''Hades'' was a form of [[limbo]] for the unjudged dead.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

The most common New Testament term translated as "Hell" is {{lang|grc|γέεννα}} (''[[gehenna]]''), a direct loan of Hebrew גהנום/גהנם (''[[gehenna|ge-hinnom]]''). Apart from one use in {{Bibleref2|James|3:6|ASV}}, this term is found exclusively in the [[synoptic gospels]].&lt;ref&gt;''New Bible Dictionary'' 3rd ed., IVP, Leicester 1996. Article "Hell", pages 463-464&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NDBThell"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Nature of Hell|author=[[Evangelical Alliance]] Commission on Truth and Unity Among Evangelicals (ACUTE)|publisher=Paternoster, London|year=2000|pages=42–47}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Gehenna'' is most frequently described as a place of fiery torment (e.g., Matthew 5:22, 18:8-9; Mark 9:43-49); other passages mention darkness and "weeping and gnashing of teeth" (e.g., Matthew 8:12; 22:13).&lt;ref name="NDBThell"&gt;''New Dictionary of Biblical Theology''; IVP Leicester 2000, "Hell"&lt;/ref&gt;

Apart from the use of the term ''gehenna'' (translated as "Hell" or "Hell fire" in most English translations of the Bible; sometimes transliterated, or translated differently)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%2012:5&amp;version=PHILLIPS&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%2012:5&amp;version=AMP&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%2012:5&amp;version=YLT&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Johannine literature|Johannine writings]] refer to the destiny of the wicked in terms of "perishing", "death" and "condemnation" or "judgment". [[Paul the Apostle|Paul]] speaks of "wrath" and "everlasting destruction" (cf. {{Bibleref2|Romans|2:7-9}}; {{Bibleref2|2Thes|1:9||2&amp;nbsp; Thessalonians|1:9}}), while the [[general epistles]] use a range of terms and images including "raging fire" ({{Bibleref2|Hebrews|10:27}}), "destruction" ({{Bibleref2|2Peter|3:7||2&amp;nbsp; Peter&amp;nbsp;3:7}}), "eternal fire" ({{Bibleref2|Jude|7}}) and "blackest darkness" ({{Bibleref2|Jude|13}}). The [[Book of Revelation]] contains the image of a "[[lake of fire]]" and "burning sulphur" where "the devil, [[The Beast (Bible)|the beast]], and [[false prophet]]" will be "tormented day and night for ever and ever" ({{Bibleref2|Revelation|20:10}}) along with those who worship the beast or receive [[Mark of the Beast|its mark]] ({{Bibleref2|Revelation|14:11}}).&lt;ref name="Acute"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Nature of Hell|author=Evangelical Alliance Commission on Unity and Truth among Evangelicals|publisher=Acute, Paternoster (London)|year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The New Testament also uses the Greek word ''[[hades]]'', usually to refer to the abode of the dead (e.g., {{Bibleref2|Acts|2:31}}; {{Bibleref2|Revelation|20:13}}).&lt;ref name="NBDsheol"/&gt; Only one passage describes ''hades'' as a place of torment, the parable of [[Lazarus and Dives]] ({{Bibleref2|Luke|16:19-31|NIV}}). Jesus here depicts a wicked man suffering fiery torment in ''hades'', which is contrasted with the [[bosom of Abraham]], and explains that it is impossible to cross over from one to the other. Some scholars believe that this parable reflects the [[intertestamental]] Jewish view of ''hades'' (or ''sheol'') as containing separate divisions for the wicked and righteous.&lt;ref name="NBDsheol"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Acute"/&gt; In {{Bibleref2|Revelation|20:13-14|NIV}} ''hades'' is itself thrown into the "lake of fire" after being emptied of the dead.

=== Parables of Jesus concerning the hereafter ===
In the eschatological discourse of {{Bibleref2|Matthew|25:31-46}}, Jesus says that, when the [[Son of Man]] comes in his glory, he will separate people from one another as a shepherd separates sheep from goats, and will consign to everlasting fire those who failed to aid "the least of his brothers". This separation is stark, with no explicit provision made for fine gradations of merit or guilt:&lt;ref&gt;"hell." ''Encyclopædia Britannica''. ''Encyclopædia Britannica Online Academic Edition.'' Encyclopædia Britannica Inc., 2013. Web. 4 Mar. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quote|Depart from me, you who are cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels. For I was hungry and you gave me nothing to eat, I was thirsty and you gave me nothing to drink, I was a stranger and you did not invite me in, I needed clothes and you did not clothe me, I was sick and in prison and you did not look after me. ...whatever you did not do for one of the least of these, you did not do for me.|Matthew 25:41–43 (NIV)}}

In a parable about "The Rich Man and Lazarus" in {{Bibleref2|Luke|16:19-31}}, the poor man Lazarus enjoys a blissful repose in the "bosom of Abraham" ({{Bibleref2|Luke|16:22}}), while the rich man who was happy in life is tormented by fire in Hades ({{Bibleref2|Luke|16:23-24}}), the two realms being separated by a great chasm ({{Bibleref2|Luke|16:26}}).

;; Eastern Orthodox views
{{See also|Apocatastasis}}

The Eastern Orthodox Church teaches that [[Heaven (Christianity)|Heaven]] and Hell are relations to or experiences of God's just and loving presence.&lt;ref name="Godhimself"&gt;God himself is both heaven and hell, reward and punishment. All men have been created to see God unceasingly in His uncreated glory. Whether God will be for each man heaven or hell, reward or punishment, depends on man's response to God's love and on man's transformation from the state of selfish and self-centered love, to Godlike love which does not seek its own ends. EMPIRICAL THEOLOGY VERSUS SPECULATIVE THEOLOGY by John S. Romanides part 2 [http://www.romanity.org/htm/rom.03.en.franks_romans_feudalism_and_doctrine.02.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thus it is the Church's spiritual teaching that God does not punish man by some material fire or physical torment. God simply reveals Himself in the risen Lord Jesus in such a glorious way that no man can fail to behold His glory. It is the presence of God's splendid glory and love that is the scourge of those who reject its radiant power and light.&lt;br /&gt; ... those who find themselves in hell will be chastised by the scourge of love. How cruel and bitter this torment of love will be! For those who understand that they have sinned against love, undergo no greater suffering than those produced by the most fearful tortures. The sorrow which takes hold of the heart, which has sinned against love, is more piercing than any other pain. It is not right to say that the sinners in hell are deprived of the love of God ... But love acts in two ways, as suffering of the reproved, and as joy in the blessed! (St. Isaac of Syria, Mystic Treatises) ''The Orthodox Church of America website'' [http://www.oca.org/OCchapter.asp?SID=2&amp;ID=208]&lt;/ref&gt; There is no created place of divine absence, nor is hell an ontological separation from God.&lt;ref&gt;For those who love the Lord, His Presence will be infinite joy, paradise and eternal life. For those who hate the Lord, the same Presence will be infinite torture, hell and eternal death. The reality for both the saved and the damned will be exactly the same when Christ "comes in glory, and all angels with Him, " so that "God may be all in all." (I Corinthians 15-28) Those who have God as their "all" within this life will finally have divine fulfillment and life. For those whose "all" is themselves and this world, the "all" of God will be their torture, their punishment and their death. And theirs will be "weeping and gnashing of teeth." (Matthew 8:21, et al.)

The Son of Man will send His angels and they will gather out of His kingdom all causes of sin and all evil doers, and throw them into the furnace of fire; there men will weep and gnash their teeth. Then the righteous will shine like the sun in the Kingdom of their Father. (Matthew 13:41-43)

According to the saints, the "fire" that will consume sinners at the coming of the Kingdom of God is the same "fire" that will shine with splendor in the saints. It is the "fire" of God's love; the "fire" of God Himself who is Love. "For our God is a consuming fire" (Hebrews 12:29) who "dwells in unapproachable light." (I Timothy 6:16) For those who love God and who love all creation in Him, the "consuming fire" of God will be radiant bliss and unspeakable delight. For those who do not love God, and who do not love at all, this same "consuming fire" will be the cause of their "weeping" and their "gnashing of teeth."

Thus it is the Catholic Church's spiritual teaching that God does not punish man by some material fire or physical torment. God simply reveals Himself in the risen Lord Jesus in such a glorious way that no man can fail to behold His glory. It is the presence of God's splendid glory and love that is the scourge of those who reject its radiant power and light. ... those who find themselves in hell will be chastised by the scourge of love. How cruel and bitter this torment of love will be! For those who understand that they have sinned against love, undergo no greater suffering than those produced by the most fearful tortures. The sorrow which takes hold of the heart, which has sinned against love, is more piercing than any other pain. It is not right to say that the sinners in hell are deprived of the love of God ... But love acts in two ways, as suffering of the reproved, and as joy in the blessed! (St. Isaac of Syria, Mystic Treatises) The Orthodox Church of America website [http://www.oca.org/OCchapter.asp?SID=2&amp;ID=208]&lt;/ref&gt; One expression of the Eastern teaching is that hell and heaven are dimensions of God's intensifying presence, as this presence is experienced either as torment or as paradise depending on the spiritual state of a person dwelling with God.&lt;ref name="Godhimself" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Paradise and Hell exist not in the form of a threat and a punishment on the part of God but in the form of an illness and a cure. Those who are cured and those who are purified experience the illuminating energy of divine grace, while the uncured and ill experience the caustic energy of God." [http://www.pelagia.org/htm/b24.en.life_after_death.07.htm] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111227233654/http://www.pelagia.org/htm/b24.en.life_after_death.07.htm |date=27 December 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For one who [[Misotheism|hates God]] and by extension hates himself as God's image-bearer, to be encompassed by the divine presence could only result in unspeakable anguish.&lt;ref name="pelagia. org"&gt;Man has a malfunctioning or non-functioning noetic faculty in the heart, and it is the task especially of the clergy to apply the cure of unceasing memory of God, otherwise called unceasing prayer or illumination. "Those who have selfless love and are friends of God see God in light—Divine light, while the selfish and impure see God the judge as fire—darkness".

Without this, it is impossible for man's selfish love to be transformed into selfless love. This transformation takes place during the higher level of the stage of illumination called theoria, literally meaning vision-in this case vision by means of unceasing and uninterrupted memory of God. Those who remain selfish and self-centered with a hardened heart, closed to God's love, will not see the glory of God in this life. However, they will see God's glory eventually, but as an eternal and consuming fire and outer darkness. From FRANKS, ROMANS, FEUDALISM, AND DOCTRINE/Diagnosis and Therapy Father John S. Romanides Diagnosis and Therapy [http://www.romanity.org/htm/rom.03.en.franks_romans_feudalism_and_doctrine.02.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle Papanikolaou [http://www.fordham.edu/academics/programs_at_fordham_/theology/faculty/aristotle_papanikola_26156.asp] and Elizabeth H. Prodromou [https://web.archive.org/web/20110202043637/http://www.bu.edu/ir/faculty/alphabetical/prodromou/] wrote in their book ''Thinking Through Faith: New Perspectives from Orthodox Christian Scholars'' that for the Orthodox: "Those theological symbols, heaven and hell, are not crudely understood as spatial destinations but rather refer to the experience of God's presence according to two different modes."&lt;ref&gt;Regarding specific conditions of after-life existence and eschatology, Orthodox thinkers are generally reticent; yet two basic shared teachings can be singled out. First, they widely hold that immediately following a human being's physical death, his or her surviving spiritual dimension experiences a foretaste of either heaven or hell.
(Those theological symbols, heaven and hell, are not crudely understood as spatial destinations but rather refer to the experience of God's presence according to two different modes.)

Prodromou [https://books.google.com/books?id=oqIjyCKOAAUC&amp;pg=PA193&amp;dq=Prodromou+separation+rupture+alienation&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=EBiaTMrFH4GB8gao2ICYAQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCsQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=hell&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt; Several Orthodox theologians do describe hell as separation from God, in the sense of being out of fellowship or loving communion. [[Archimandrite Sophrony]] (Sakharov) spoke of "the hell of separation from God".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JERJcdSKDbsC&amp;pg=PA32 |first=Archimandrite |last=Sophrony |title=The Monk of Mount Athos: Staretz Silouan, 1866-1938 |publisher=St Vladimir's Seminary Press |year=2001 |isbn=0-913836-15-X |page=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paul Evdokimov stated: "Hell is nothing else but separation of man from God, his autonomy excluding him from the place where God is present."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-6yosWlACnYC&amp;pg=PA32 |title=In the World, of the Church: A Paul Evdokimov Reader |publisher=St Vladimir's Seminary Press |year=2001 |isbn=0-88141-215-5 |page=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Theodore Stylianopoulos, "Hell is a spiritual state of separation from God and inability to experience the love of God, while being conscious of the ultimate deprivation of it as punishment."&lt;ref&gt;[http://stgeorgekeene.pmcgee.org/monthlybulletins/August2010bulletin.pdf Father Theodore Stylianopoulos]{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Michel Quenot stated: "Hell is none other than the state of separation from God, a condition into which humanity was plunged for having preferred the creature to the Creator. It is the human creature, therefore, and not God, who engenders hell. Created free for the sake of love, man possesses the incredible power to reject this love, to say 'no' to God. By refusing communion with God, he becomes a predator, condemning himself to a spiritual death (hell) more dreadful than the physical death that derives from it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YppZakl7uygC&amp;pg=PA85 |first=Michel |last=Quenot |title=The Resurrection and the Icon |publisher=St. Vladimir's Seminary Press |year=1997 |isbn=0-88141-149-3 |page=85}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another writer declared: "The circumstances that rise before us, the problems we encounter, the relationships we form, the choices we make, all ultimately concern our eternal union with or separation from God."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theologic.com/oflweb/secular/thank3.htm ''Life Transfigured: A Journal of Orthodox Nuns'', Vol. 24, No. 2, Summer 1991, pp. 8–9, produced by The Orthodox Monastery of the Transfiguration, Ellwood City, Pa.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Eastern Orthodox Church rejects what is presented as the Roman Catholic doctrine of [[purgatory]] as a place where believers suffer as their "[[venial sin]]s" are purged before gaining admittance to heaven.&lt;ref&gt;Orthodox Christianity also rejects such teachings as the Immaculate Conception, purgatory, and other uniquely Roman Catholic doctrines. [http://www.oca.org/QA.asp?ID=200&amp;SID=3]&lt;/ref&gt;

Contrary to [[Western Christianity]], both Roman and Protestant varieties, the Christians of the East emphasize the mystery of God in His pre-eternal transcendence and maintain a tradition of [[apophatic theology]], while the technical, [[cataphatic theology]] of [[scholasticism]] tends to be downplayed or viewed as subordinate. {{citation needed|date=November 2011}} Thus, there is no single "official" teaching of the Church apart from apostolic doctrine received and, when necessary, defined by [[Ecumenical council|Ecumenical Councils]]. The Orthodox positions on hell are derived from the sayings of the [[saint]]s and the consensus views of the [[Church Fathers]]. They are not in agreement on all points, and no council universally recognized by the Eastern Orthodox Churches has formulated doctrine on hell, {{citation needed|date=November 2011}} so there is no official doctrine to which all the faithful are bound. Beliefs concerning the nature and duration of hell are considered ''theologoumena'', or theological opinions, rather than dogmas of the Church.

=== Images of Hell ===
[[File:StJohnClimacus.jpg|thumb|right|Icon in Saint Catherine's Monastery, Sinai, showing monks falling from the ''Ladder to Heaven'' into the mouth of a dragon, representing Hell]]
Saint [[John Chrysostom]] pictured Hell as associated with "unquenchable" fire and "various kinds of torments and torrents of punishment".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.monachos.net/content/patristics/patristictexts/171-chrysostom-theodore Epistle I to Theodore of Mopsuestia] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101230171912/http://monachos.net/content/patristics/patristictexts/171-chrysostom-theodore |date=30 December 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:Depiction of Hell.jpg|thumb|left|Depiction of Hell on an [[icon]] in [[Gelati Monastery]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]]]

Eastern Orthodox [[iconography|icons]] of the [[Last Judgment]], most notably in the Slavic traditions, often depict tormented, lost sinners in Hell. Pages 66–69 of [http://www.google.com/search?tbs=bks%3A1&amp;tbo=1&amp;q=978-0-8020-9809-2&amp;btnG=Search+Books John-Paul Himka's ''Last Judgment Iconography in the Carpathians''] provides an illustrated description of some such 15th-century [[Carpathian Ruthenia|Carpathian]] icons based on a northern Rus' prototype (p.&amp;nbsp;193). The depiction in these particular icons, a depiction that may have developed from 12th-century Greek and South Slavic depictions differentiating sinners and their punishments (p.&amp;nbsp;68), is referred to by Himka as "the new hell", "because various sinners are being punished in a squarish area with torments that did not appear in the standard Byzantine iconography" (p.&amp;nbsp;42).

Icons based on ''[[The Ladder of Divine Ascent]]'', by Saint [[John Climacus]], show [[monk]]s ascending a thirty-rung ladder to Heaven represented by Christ, or succumbing to the arrows of demons and falling from the ladder into Hell, sometimes represented by an open-jawed dragon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hsAApqqC1KUC&amp;pg=PA20 |first=Robin |last=Cormack |title=Icons |publisher=British Museum Press |year=2007 |isbn=0-674-02619-5 |page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Where souls go after death ===
Aquinas uses an analogy of buoyancy:
{{Quote|text=And since a place is assigned to souls [[Salvation_in_Christianity#Catholicism|in keeping with]] their [[Beatific_vision|reward]] or punishment, as soon as the soul is set free from the body it is either plunged into hell or soars to heaven, unless it be held back by some debt, for which its flight must needs be delayed until the soul is first of all cleansed. ... Sometimes [[venial sin]], though needing first of all to be [[Purgatory|cleansed]], is an obstacle to the receiving of the reward; the result being that the reward is delayed.

=== Hell as self-exclusion ===
The ''[[Catechism of the Catholic Church]]'' which, when published in 1992, [[Pope John Paul II]] declared to be "a sure norm for teaching the faith",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/apost_constitutions/documents/hf_jp-ii_apc_19921011_fidei-depositum_en.html |title=Fidei depositum |accessdate=2011-01-14 |date=11 October 1992 |publisher=Libreria Editrice Vaticana |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926220256/http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/apost_constitutions/documents/hf_jp-ii_apc_19921011_fidei-depositum_en.html |archivedate=26 September 2007 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; defines hell as eternal fiery punishment for refusing to love God:

: We cannot be united with God unless we freely choose to love him. But we cannot love God if we sin gravely against him, against our neighbor or against ourselves: "He who does not love remains in death. Anyone who hates his brother is a murderer, and you know that no murderer has eternal life abiding in him." Our Lord warns us that we shall be separated from him if we fail to meet the serious needs of the poor and the little ones who are his brethren. To die in mortal sin without repenting and accepting God's merciful love means remaining separated from him for ever by our own free choice. This state of definitive self-exclusion from communion with God and the blessed is called "hell."  Jesus often speaks of "Gehenna" of "the unquenchable fire" reserved for those who to the end of their lives refuse to believe and be converted, where both soul and body can be lost. Jesus solemnly proclaims that he "will send his angels, and they will gather... all evil doers, and throw them into the furnace of fire," and that he will pronounce the condemnation: "Depart from me, you cursed, into the eternal fire!"  The teaching of the Church affirms the existence of hell and its eternity. Immediately after death the souls of those who die in a state of mortal sin descend into hell, which is described (in quotes) as "eternal fire."&lt;ref name=catech&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P2O.HTM Catechism of the Catholic Church, 1033] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120609122435/http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P2O.HTM |date=9 June 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hell as a place or a state ===
==== State ====
The [[Catechism of Saint Pius X|Catechism]] published by [[Pope Pius X]] in 1908 defined Hell by using the word "state" alone: "Hell is a state to which the wicked are condemned, and in which they are deprived of the sight of God for all eternity, and are in dreadful torments."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/resource.php?n=474 LESSON THIRTY-SEVENTH: On the Last Judgment and the Resurrection, Hell, Purgatory, and Heaven, (Question 1379)]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pope John Paul II]] stated on 28 July 1999, that, in speaking of Hell as a place, the Bible uses "a symbolic language", which "must be correctly interpreted … Rather than a place, hell indicates the state of those who freely and definitively separate themselves from God, the source of all life and joy."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/audiences/1999/documents/hf_jp-ii_aud_28071999_en.html Pope John Paul II, Audience Talk, 28 July 1999]&lt;/ref&gt; Some have interpreted these words as a denial that Hell can be considered to be a place, or at least as providing an alternative picture of Hell.&lt;ref&gt;"Hell is traditionally considered a literal place of eternal torture, but the Pope has also described hell as the condition of pain that results from alienation from God, a thing of one's own doing, not an actual place.", Burke, Chauvin, &amp; Miranti, ''Religious and spiritual issues in counseling'', p. 236 (2003).&lt;/ref&gt; Others have explicitly disagreed with the interpretation of what the Pope said as an actual denial that Hell can be considered a place and have said that the Pope was only directing attention away from what is secondary to the real essence of hell.&lt;ref&gt;"In the common sense of the word 'place', if you were to say 'Hell is not a place', you would be denying that Hell exists. Some thought that the Pope, in the statement quoted above, was denying that Hell is a place in this sense. He was, of course, doing nothing of the sort. Thus, to return to the Pope's words again, John Paul II must not be misinterpreted when he said 'Rather than [or more than] a place, hell indicates [a] state….' He certainly was not denying that it is a place, but instead was shifting our focus to the real essence of hell—what the term 'hell' truly indicates—the self-chosen separation from God. The 'place' or 'location' of hell is secondary, and considerations of where it is should not deflect us from our most important concerns: what it is, and how to avoid it" (https://web.archive.org/web/20110928085437/http://www.cuf.org/faithfacts/details_view.asp?ffID=69%29.&lt;/ref&gt;

Catholic theologian [[Hans Urs von Balthasar]] (1905–1988) said that "we must see that hell is not an object that is 'full' or 'empty' of human individuals, but a possibility that is not 'created' by God but in any case by the free individuals who choose it".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.google.com/search?tbm=bks&amp;tbo=1&amp;q=mulder+%22free+individuals+who%22&amp;btnG=|author=Jack Mulder|title=Kierkegaard and the Catholic Tradition|publisher=Indiana University Press|year=2010|isbn=978-0-253-22236-7|page=145}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The ''Catholic Faith Handbook for Youth'', with [[imprimatur]] of 2007, also says that "more accurately" heaven and hell are not places but states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DANMe2tIfgYC&amp;pg=PT421 |first1=Brian |last1=Singer-Towns |first2=Janet |last2=Claussen |first3=Clare |last3=Vanbrandwijk |title=Catholic Faith Handbook for Youth |publisher=Saint Mary's Press |year=2008 |isbn=978-0-88489-987-7 |page=421}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Order of Friars Minor Capuchin|Capuchin]] theologian Berard A. Marthaler also says that "hell is not 'a place'".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TY3-aZIo9HEC&amp;pg=PA211 |first=Berard A. |last=Marthaler |title=The Creed |publisher=Twenty-Third Publications |year=2007 |isbn=978-0-89622-537-4 |page=211}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==== Place ====
Traditionally in the past Hell has been spoken of or considered as a place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |quote=Hell was a place of eternal suffering for sinners |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Qp7ZF2EzBAUC&amp;pg=PA8 |first=Lizann |last=Flatt |title=Religion in the Renaissance |publisher=Crabtree |year=2009 |isbn=978-0-7787-4597-6 |page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some have rejected metaphorical interpretations of the biblical descriptions of hell,&lt;ref&gt;"No cogent reason has been advanced for accepting a metaphorical interpretation in preference to the most natural meaning of the words of Scripture" (Hontheim in [[Catholic Encyclopedia]] 1910).&lt;/ref&gt; and have attributed to Hell a location within the earth,&lt;ref&gt;"Theologians generally accept the opinion that hell is really within the earth" (Hontheim 1910)&lt;/ref&gt; while others who uphold the opinion that hell is a definite place, say instead that its location is unknown.&lt;ref&gt;"It is certain from Scripture and tradition that the torments of hell are inflicted in a definite place. But it is uncertain where the place is" Addis &amp; Arnold (eds), ''A Catholic Dictionary Containing Some Account of the Doctrine, Discipline, Rites, Ceremonies, Councils, and Religious Orders of the Catholic Church: Part One'', p. 404 (1903).&lt;/ref&gt; 

In a homily given on 25 March 2007, [[Pope Benedict XVI]] stated: "Jesus came to tell us that he wants us all in heaven and that hell, of which so little is said in our time, exists and is eternal for those who close their hearts to his love."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/homilies/2007/documents/hf_ben-xvi_hom_20070325_visita-parrocchia_en.html Text on the Holy See website]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cinews.ie/article.php?artid=3356 CiNews of 28 March 2007] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720045541/http://www.cinews.ie/article.php?artid=3356 |date=20 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Journalist Richard Owen's interpretation of this remark as declaring that hell is an actual place was reported in many media.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Times]]'', 27 March 2007, reported "Hell is a place where sinners really do burn in an everlasting fire, and not just a religious symbol designed to galvanise the faithful, the Pope has said" ([http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/europe/article1572646.ece The Fires of Hell Are Real and Eternal, Pope Warns]). [[Fox News]] reproduced the article as published on ''The Times'', under the heading: "Pope: Hell Is a Real Place Where Sinners Burn in Everlasting Fire" ([http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,261844,00.html Pope: Hell Is a Real Place Where Sinners Burn in Everlasting Fire]). ''The Australian'' published Owen's article on its 28 March 2007 issue ([http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/world/hell-is-real-and-eternal-pope/story-e6frg6so-1111113237028 Hell is real and eternal: Pope]). The Canadian [[National Post]] of 28 March 2007, quoting ''The Times'', reported: "Pope Benedict XVI has been reminding the faithful of some key beliefs of their faith, including the fact hell is a place where sinners burn in an everlasting fire" ([http://www.canada.com/nationalpost/news/story.html?id=626f4f93-9e33-4339-b61c-b94535beab36 Hell 'exists and is eternal, ' Pope warns] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101111032322/http://www.canada.com/nationalpost/news/story.html?id=626f4f93-9e33-4339-b61c-b94535beab36 |date=11 November 2010 }}). The [[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]] of 3 April 2007, again referring to ''The Times'', reported: "Pope Benedict XVI has reinstated hell as a real place where the heat is always on." ([http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/07093/774641-294.stm Playing with fire])&lt;/ref&gt; But in the ''Catechism of the Catholic Church'' (1035), over whose production Benedict presided when he was prefect of the [[Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith]], we read: "The chief punishment of hell is eternal separation from God".&lt;ref name=catech/&gt;{{rp|ii}}

Writing in the 1910 ''Catholic Encyclopedia'', Joseph Hontheim said that "theologians generally accept the opinion that hell is really within the earth. The Catholic Church has decided nothing on this subject; hence we may say hell is a definite place; but where it is, we do not know." He cited the view of Saint Augustine of Hippo that Hell is under the earth and that of Saint [[Pope Gregory I|Gregory the Great]] that hell is either on the earth or under it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07207a.htm Joseph Hontheim, "Hell" in ''The Catholic Encyclopedia'', Vol. 7. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1910. Retrieved 3 September 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;

The posthumous supplement to Aquinas' [[Summa theologica|Summa theologiciae]] [http://www.newadvent.org/summa/5097.htm suppl. Q97 A4] flags discussion of the location of hell as speculation: ''As Augustine says (De Civ. Dei xv, 16), "I am of opinion that no one knows in what part of the world hell is situated, unless the Spirit of God has revealed this to some one."''
==== Both ====
Other Catholics neither affirm nor deny that hell is a place, and speak of it as "a place or state". [[Ludwig Ott|Ludwig Ott's]] work "The Fundamentals of Catholic Dogma" said: "Hell is a place or state of eternal punishment inhabited by those rejected by God".&lt;ref&gt;Ott, ''The Fundamentals of Catholic Dogma'', p. 479 (1955).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert J. Fox]] wrote: "Hell is a place or state of eternal punishment inhabited by those rejected by God because such souls have rejected God's saving grace."&lt;ref&gt;Fox, "The Catholic Faith", p. 262 (1983).&lt;/ref&gt; Evangelicals [[Norman L. Geisler]] and Ralph E. MacKenzie interpret official Roman Catholic teaching as: "Hell is a place or state of eternal punishment inhabited by those rejected by God."&lt;ref&gt;Geisler &amp; MacKenzie, "Roman Catholics and Evangelicals: agreements and differences", p. 143 (1995).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Nature of suffering in Hell ===
It is agreed that hell is a place of suffering.&lt;ref&gt;"The Green Catechism" (1939–62) said:

Hell is a place of torments. God made hell to punish the devils or bad angels, and all who die in mortal sin. No one can come out of Hell, for out of Hell there is no redemption" (Crawford &amp; Rossiter, "Reasons for Living: Education and Young People's Search for Meaning" (2006). p. 192).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Hell is the place and state of eternal punishment for the fallen angels and human beings who die deliberately estranged from the love of God" (work by Fr. Kenneth Baker published by [[Ignatius Press]] ).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"What do we mean by "hell"? Hell is the place and state of eternal punishment for the fallen angels and human beings who die deliberately estranged from the love of God. The existence of hell, as the everlasting abode of the devils and those human beings who have died in the state of mortal sin, is a defined dogma of the Catholic Church" (Baker, "Fundamentals of Catholicism" (1983), volume 3, p. 371).&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Catechism of the Catholic Church'' states:

{{Quote|Jesus often speaks of "Gehenna" of "the unquenchable fire" reserved for those who to the end of their lives refuse to believe and be converted, where both soul and body can be lost. Jesus solemnly proclaims that he "will send his angels, and they will gather. . . all evil doers, and throw them into the furnace of fire", and that he will pronounce the condemnation: "Depart from me, you cursed, into the eternal fire!"&lt;br&gt;
The teaching of the Church affirms the existence of hell and its eternity. Immediately after death the souls of those who die in a state of mortal sin descend into hell, where they suffer the punishments of hell, "eternal fire". The chief punishment of hell is eternal separation from God, in whom alone man can possess the life and happiness for which he was created and for which he longs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P2O.HTM ''Catechism of the Catholic Church'', 1035] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120609122435/http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P2O.HTM |date=9 June 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Although the Catechism explicitly speaks of the punishments of hell in the plural, calling them "eternal fire", and speaks of eternal separation from God as the "chief" of those punishments, one commentator claims that it is non-committal on the existence of forms of punishment other than that of separation of God: after all, God, being above all a merciful and loving entity, takes no pleasure in the death of the living, and does not will or predestine anyone to go there (the Catholic stance is that God does not will suffering, and that the only entities known to be in hell beyond a doubt are Satan and his evil angels, and that the only suffering in hell is not fire or torture, but the freely-chosen, irrevocable and unescapable eternal separation from God and his freely given love, and the righteous, who are in heaven; thus the Church and the Popes have placed emphasis on the potential irreversibility of a mortally sinful life that goes un-absolved before one's death, and the dogma and reality of the place or state of hell).&lt;ref&gt;"The recent Catechism is ambiguous, neither denying nor confirming the existence of physical torments" - Charles Steven Seymour, "A Theodicy of Hell', p. 82 (2000).&lt;/ref&gt; Another interpretation is that the Catechism by no means denies other forms of suffering, but stresses that the pain of loss is central to the Catholic understanding of hell.&lt;ref&gt;"Hell is the natural consequence of a life lived apart from God. The terrible suffering of hell consists in the realization that, over the course of a lifetime, one has come, not to love, but to hate one's true good, and thus to be radically unfit to enjoy that Good. It is this pain of loss that is central to the Catholic understanding of hell. Imagine the predicament of one who both knows that God is the great love of his life, and that he has turned irreversably away from this love. This is what hell is" ([https://books.google.com/books?id=FwP7UTl2zWoC&amp;pg=PA45&amp;dq=catholic+hell+suffering&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=DtdATrvaD86WhQfR3f2_CQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCsQ6AEwADgo#v=onepage&amp;q=catholic%20hell%20suffering&amp;f=false J. A. DiNoia, Gabriel O'Donnell, Romanus Cessario, Peter J. Cameron (editors), ''The Love That Never Ends: A Key to the Catechism of the Catholic Church'', p. 45).]&lt;/ref&gt;

Saint [[Augustine of Hippo]] said that the suffering of hell is compounded because God continues to love the sinner who is not able to return the love.&lt;ref name=Marthaler/&gt; According to the Church, whatever is the nature of the sufferings, "they are not imposed by a vindictive judge"&lt;ref name=Marthaler&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TY3-aZIo9HEC&amp;pg=PA211 |first=Berard L. |last=Marthaler |title=The Creed |publisher=Twenty-Third Publications |year=2007 |isbn=978-0-89622-537-4 |page=211}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aqwXZMeuJkoC&amp;pg=PA176 |first=Zachary J. |last=Hayes |title=Four Views on Hell |publisher=Zondervan |year=1996 |isbn=0-310-21268-5 |page=176}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Concerning the detailed specific nature of hell ... the Catholic Church has defined nothing. ... It is useless to speculate about its true nature, and more sensible to confess our ignorance in a question that evidently exceeds human understanding."&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=O-kj_LncEjAC&amp;pg=PA19&amp;dq=catholic+hell+suffering&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=DtdATrvaD86WhQfR3f2_CQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ved=0CEcQ6AEwBTgo#v=onepage&amp;q=catholic%20hell%20suffering&amp;f=false John Anthony O'Brien, ''The Faith of Millions: The Credentials of the Catholic Religion'', pp. 19–20]&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book, ''Inventing Hell'', Catholic writer and historian [[Jon M. Sweeney]] is critical of the ways that Christians have appropriated Dante's vision and images of hell. In its review, ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' called the book "persuasively argued."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-1-4555-8224-2&lt;/ref&gt; An article on the same subject by Sweeney that was published on the Huffington Post's religion page was liked by more than 19,000 people, including [[Anne Rice]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.facebook.com/annericefanpage/posts/10152502099210452&lt;/ref&gt;

===Visions concerning Hell===

A number of Catholic mystics and saints have claimed to have received visions of hell or other revelations concerning hell. During various Marian apparitions, such as those at Fatima or at Kibeho, the visionaries claimed that the Virgin Mary during the course of the visions showed them a view of hell where sinners were suffering.

In the Bible, in the Book of Revelation, [[John of Patmos]] writes about seeing a lake of fire where the 'beast' and all those marked with his number were placed.

[[Columba of Iona]] is alleged to have on several occasions even been able to name particular individuals who he said were going to end life in hellfire for their sins and accurately predicted the way they would die before the event had even happened.&lt;ref&gt;Adomnan of Iona, Life of St Columba. Penguin Books, 1995&lt;/ref&gt;
 
A story recorded by Cluniac monks in the Middle Ages claimed that St Benedict appeared to a monk on one occasion and told the monk that there had just been (at that point in time) a monk who had fled the monastic life to go back into the world, and the ex-monk then died and he went to hell.&lt;ref&gt;Lucy Margaret Smith.

=== How full is Hell? ===
==== Particular ====
At the level of particular individuals:
: ...the definitive presence of any one soul in Hell is not part of Divine Revelation and therefore outside the pale of the Church's competence to define.[http://unamsanctamcatholicam.blogspot.com.au/2013/11/fr-barron-and-mark-shea-and-balthasar.html]

Pope John Paul II pointed out in ''Crossing the Threshold of Hope'', the Church has never taught that even Judas Iscariot is damned. That said, the gospels do have Jesus say that he would be better off to never be born.  [https://www.firstthings.com/article/2001/08/will-all-be-saved]

==== General ====
Pope Pius IX stated exclusions that seemingly apply to infancy, incapacity, [[Invincible_ignorance_(Catholic_theology)|invincible ignorance]]:
: Because God knows, searches and clearly understands the minds, hearts, thoughts, and nature of all, his supreme kindness and clemency do not permit anyone at all who is not guilty of deliberate sin to suffer eternal punishments.[http://www.papalencyclicals.net/pius09/p9quanto.htm Quanto conficiamur moerore, p8] 

The Church proclaims the availability of [[Redeemer_(Christianity)| redemption]], but it does not teach universal salvation[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01599a.htm], which would constrain God, nor it does have defined detailed doctrines on edge case such as the [[Limbo#Limbo_of_Infants|state or location]] of unbaptised infants who die, since these go beyond what has been specifically revealed.

However, in long Catholic [[Limbo#Medieval_theologians| tradition]] and the recent Vatican publications ( [[Limbo#Modern_era|The Hope of Salvation for Infants Who Die without Being Baptized]]), unbaptized infants who die would not be described as being in the Hell of punishment, but may enjoy the [[beatific vision]].
 
Pope Benedict XVI commented on the Catechism passage given above:
: There can be people who have [[Eternal_sin#Roman_Catholicism| totally destroyed]] their desire for truth and readiness to love, people for whom everything has become a lie, people who have lived for hatred and have suppressed all love within themselves. ... In such people all would be beyond remedy and the destruction of good would be irrevocable: this is what we mean by the word Hell. ... For the great majority of people—we may suppose—there remains in the depths of their being an ultimate interior openness to truth, to love, to God. [http://w2.vatican.va/content/benedict-xvi/en/encyclicals/documents/hf_ben-xvi_enc_20071130_spe-salvi.html Spea salvi p45, 46]

Writer Mark Shea notes that the Church ''prays in her liturgy that all will be saved. You can’t pray for the impossible.''[http://www.ncregister.com/blog/mark-shea/a-reader-has-a-question-about-hell] The recent [http://www.catholicworldreport.com/2018/03/31/did-hans-urs-von-balthasar-teach-that-everyone-will-certainly-be-saved/ controversial] view of [[Hans Urs von Balthasar]] in his book ''Dare we Hope that all Men be Saved?'', which draws on speculation by St [[Edith Stein]], proposes that it is legitimate for Catholics to none-the-less hope for the possibility that Hell will be empty, without using that as an excuse for sin. Balthasar's view is that God's "mercy" and "goodness" are greater than his "justice", because ''between the misdeeds of the creature and the goodness of God there is no equilibrium''.[https://books.google.com.au/books?id=mtRJDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA121&amp;lpg=PA121&amp;dq=between+the+misdeeds+of+the+creature+equilibrium&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=FBE6QsanVA&amp;sig=v0n8ZtWGkfOygyDwbPVrwACBXJ4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi1tNjnnJjaAhUEKZQKHSvOBNIQ6AEIJzAA#v=onepage&amp;q=between%20the%20misdeeds%20of%20the%20creature%20equilibrium&amp;f=false]

== Protestantism ==
{{Main article|Christian views on Hades}}
[[File:Brooklyn Museum - The Bad Rich Man in Hell (Le mauvais riche dans l'Enfer) - James Tissot - overall.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Parables of Jesus|parable]] of the [[Rich man and Lazarus]] depicting the rich man in hell asking for help to Abraham and Lazarus in [[Heaven (Christianity)|heaven]] by James Tissot]]
The varying Protestant views of "hell", both in relation to [[Hades]] (i.e., the abode of the dead) and [[Gehenna]] (i.e., the destination of the wicked), are largely a function of the varying Protestant views on the [[intermediate state]] between [[death]] and [[Resurrection of the Dead|resurrection]]; and different views on the [[immortality of the soul]] or the alternative, the [[conditional immortality]]. For example, [[John Calvin]], who believed in conscious existence after death,&lt;ref&gt;Calvin ''Psychopannychia''&lt;/ref&gt; had a very different concept of hell (Hades and Gehenna) to [[Martin Luther]] who held that death was [[Soul sleep|sleep]].&lt;ref&gt;Luther ''Exposition of Salomon's Booke'' etc.&lt;/ref&gt;

In most [[Protestant]] traditions, hell is the place created by God for the punishment of the [[devil]] and fallen [[angels]] (cf. {{Bibleref2|Matthew|25:41|NIV}}), and those whose names are not written in the [[book of life]] (cf. {{Bibleref2|Revelation|20:15|NIV}}). It is the final destiny of every person who does not receive [[salvation]], where they will be punished for their sins. People will be consigned to hell after the [[last judgment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Know the Truth, 2nd ed.|author=Bruce Milne|publisher=IVP|year=1998|page=335}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Eternal torment view ===
One historic Protestant view of hell is expressed in the [[Westminster Confession]] (1646):

: "but the wicked, who know not God, and obey not the gospel of Jesus Christ, shall be cast into eternal torments, and punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power." (Chapter XXXIII, Of the Last Judgment)

According to the Alliance Commission on Unity &amp; Truth among Evangelicals (ACUTE) the majority of Protestants have held that hell will be a place of unending conscious torment, both physical and spiritual,&lt;ref name="Acute"/&gt; although some recent writers such as Anglo-Catholic [[C. S. Lewis]]&lt;ref&gt;C. S. Lewis, ''The Great Divorce'', 1946&lt;/ref&gt; and [[J.P. Moreland]]&lt;ref&gt;Lee Strobel, ''The Case for Faith'', 2000&lt;/ref&gt; have cast hell in terms of "eternal separation" from God. Certain biblical texts have led some theologians{{Who|date=May 2010}} to the conclusion that punishment in hell, though eternal and irrevocable, will be proportional to the deeds of each soul (e.g., {{Bibleref2|Matthew|10:15|NIV}}, {{Bibleref2|Luke|12:46-48|NIV}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Introducing Christian Doctrine, 2nd ed|author=[[Millard Erickson]]|publisher=Baker Academic|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another area of debate is the fate of the unevangelized (i.e.,those who have never had an opportunity to hear the Christian gospel), those who die in infancy, and the mentally disabled. According to ACUTE some Protestants&lt;ref&gt;[[K. P. Yohannan]], ''Revolution in World Missions'', 1986-2004, chapter 10: "I ask my listeners to hold their wrists and find their pulse.  Then I explain that every beat they feel represents the death of someone in Asia who has died and gone to eternal hell without ever hearing the Good News of Jesus Christ even once."&lt;/ref&gt; agree with [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]] that people in these categories will be damned to hell for [[original sin]], while others believe that God will make an exception in these cases.&lt;ref name="Acute"/&gt;

=== View of conditional immortality and annihilationism ===
A minority of Protestants believe in the doctrine of [[conditional immortality]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.eauk.org/theology/acute/loader.cfm?csModule=security/getfile&amp;pageid=9164|title=The Nature of Hell. Conclusions and Recommendations|publisher=[[Evangelical Alliance]]|year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; which teaches that those sent to hell will not experience eternal conscious punishment, but instead will be extinguished or [[annihilationism|annihilated]] after a period of "limited conscious punishment".&lt;ref name="NDBThell"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.afterlife.co.nz/2011/featured-article/problem-of-hell/ The Problem of Hell]&lt;/ref&gt;

Prominent evangelical theologians who have adopted conditionalist beliefs include [[John Wenham]], [[Edward Fudge]], [[Clark Pinnock]] and [[John Stott]] (although the last has described himself as an "agnostic" on the issue of annihilationism).&lt;ref name="Acute"/&gt; Conditionalists typically reject the traditional concept of the immortality of the soul.

The [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]], [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] and [[Christadelphians]] teach the annihilationist viewpoint.

== Other groups ==

=== Christian Universalism ===
{{Main article|Christian Universalism}}

Though a theological minority in historical and contemporary Christianity, some holding mostly Protestant views (such as [[George MacDonald]], [[Karl Barth]], [[William Barclay (theologian)|William Barclay]], [[Keith DeRose]] and [[Thomas Talbott]]) believe that after serving their sentence in [[Gehenna]], all souls are reconciled to [[God]] and admitted to heaven, or ways are found at the time of death of drawing all souls to repentance so that no "hellish" suffering is experienced. This view is often called [[Christian universalism]]—its conservative branch is more specifically called 'Biblical or [[Trinitarian universalism]]'—and is not to be confused with [[Unitarian Universalism]]. See [[universal reconciliation]], ''[[apocatastasis]]'' and the [[Problem of Hell]].

Christian Universalism teaches that an eternal hell does not exist and is a later creation of the church with no biblical support. Reasoning by Christian Universalists includes that an eternal hell is against the nature, character and attributes of a loving God, human nature, sin's nature of destruction rather than perpetual misery, the nature of holiness and happiness and the nature and object of punishment.&lt;ref&gt;Guild, E.E. 'Arguments in Favour of Universalism'. http://www.tentmaker.org/books/InFavorCh20.html
http://godfire.net/eby/saviour_of_the_world.html
http://www.godfire.net/Hellidx.html&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Christian Science ===
Christian Science defines "hell" as follows: "Mortal belief; error; lust; remorse; hatred; revenge; sin; sickness; death; suffering and self-destruction; self-imposed agony; effects of sin; that which 'worketh abomination or maketh a lie. '" ([[Science and Health with Key to the Scripture]] by [[Mary Baker Eddy]], 588: 1-4.)

=== Jehovah's Witnesses ===
[[Jehovah's Witnesses]] do not believe in an immortal soul that survives after physical death. They believe the Bible presents "hell", as translated from "[[Sheol]]" and "[[Hades]]", to be the common grave for both the good and the bad. They reject the idea of a place of literal eternal pain or torment as being inconsistent with God's love and justice. They define "[[Gehenna]]" as eternal destruction or the "[[second death]]", reserved for those with no opportunity of a resurrection such as those destroyed at Armageddon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=The Watchtower|url=http://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/2002521|title=What Really Is Hell?|date=July 15, 2002|pages=5&amp;ndash;7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jehovah's Witnesses believe that others who have died before Armageddon will be resurrected bodily on earth and then judged during the 1,000-year rule of Christ; the judgement will be based on their obedience to God's laws after their resurrection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Awake!|url=http://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/102010006|title=What Is Judgment Day?|date=January 2010|pages=10&amp;ndash;11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Christadelphian]] view is broadly similar, except that they believe the resurrected will be judged on their life before resurrection.

=== Latter-day Saints ===
{{Further information|Outer darkness|Plan of salvation (Latter Day Saints)}}

[[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church) teaches that the word "hell" is used scripturally in at least two senses.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.lds.org/manual/true-to-the-faith/hell "Hell"], ''True to the Faith: A Gospel Reference'' (Salt Lake City, Utah: LDS Church, 2004) p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt; The first is a place commonly called [[Spirit world (Latter Day Saints)#Spirit prison|Spirit Prison]] which is a state of punishment for those who reject Christ and his Atonement. This is understood to be a temporary state in which the spirits of deceased persons will be taught the gospel and have an opportunity to repent and accept ordinances of salvation.&lt;ref name = dc138&gt;[http://scriptures.lds.org/en/dc/138# Doctrine and Covenants section 138].&lt;/ref&gt; Mormons teach that it was for this purpose that Christ visited the Spirit World after his crucifixion (1 Peter 3:19–20, 1 Peter 4:5–6). Modern-day [[revelation (Latter Day Saints)|revelation]] clarifies that while there, Christ began the work of salvation for the dead by commissioning spirits of the righteous to teach the gospel to those who didn't have the opportunity to receive it while on earth.&lt;ref name = dc138/&gt;

Mormons believe that righteous people will rise in a "first [[resurrection]]" and live with Christ on earth after His return.&lt;ref name="Chapter 46: The Last Judgment"&gt;[http://www.lds.org/manual/gospel-principles/chapter-46-the-final-judgment "Chapter 46: The Last Judgment"], ''[[Gospel Principles]]'' (Salt Lake City, Utah: LDS Church, 2011).&lt;/ref&gt; After the 1000 years known as the [[Millennium]], the individuals in spirit prison who chose not to accept the gospel and repent&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lds.org/scriptures/gs/hell&lt;/ref&gt; will also be resurrected and receive an immortal physical body, which is referred to as the "second resurrection".&lt;ref&gt;[http://scriptures.lds.org/en/dc/88/100-101#100 Doctrine and Covenants 88:100–01].&lt;/ref&gt; At these appointed times of resurrection, "death and hell" will deliver up the dead that are in them to be judged according to their works (Revelations 20:13), at which point all but the sons of perdition will receive a degree of glory, which Paul compared to the glory of the sun, moon, and stars (1 Corinthians 15:41). The Church explains biblical descriptions of hell being "eternal" or "endless" punishment as being descriptive of their infliction by God rather than an unending temporal period. Mormon scripture quotes God as telling church founder [[Joseph Smith]]: "I am endless, and the punishment which is given from my hand is endless punishment, for Endless is my name. Wherefore—Eternal punishment is God's punishment. Endless punishment is God's punishment."&lt;ref&gt;[http://scriptures.lds.org/en/dc/19/10,12#10 Doctrine and Covenants 19:10–12].&lt;/ref&gt;Mormons also believe in a more permanent concept of hell, commonly referred to as [[outer darkness]]. It is said that very few people who have lived on the earth will be consigned to this hell, but Mormon scripture suggests that at least [[Cain]] will be present.&lt;ref&gt;[http://scriptures.lds.org/en/moses/5/22-26#22 Moses 5:22–26].&lt;/ref&gt; Other mortals who during their lifetime become [[Son of perdition (Mormonism)|sons of perdition]], those who commit the [[Eternal sin|unpardonable sin]], will be consigned to outer darkness.&lt;ref name="Chapter 46: The Last Judgment"/&gt; It is taught that the unpardonable sin is committed by those who "den[y] the Son after the Father has revealed him".&lt;ref&gt;LDS Church, [http://scriptures.lds.org/en/gs/h/26 Guide to the Scriptures: Hell]; see also [http://scriptures.lds.org/en/dc/76/43-46#43 Doctrine and Covenants 76:43–46].&lt;/ref&gt; However, the vast majority of residents of outer darkness will be the "devil and his angels ... the third part of the hosts of heaven" who in the [[pre-existence]] followed [[Lucifer]] and never received a mortal body.&lt;ref&gt;[http://scriptures.lds.org/en/dc/29/36-39#36 Doctrine and Covenants 29:36–39].&lt;/ref&gt; The residents of outer darkness are the only children of God that will not receive one of three [[Degrees of glory|kingdoms of glory]] at the [[Last Judgment]].

It is unclear whether those in outer darkness will ultimately be redeemed. Of outer darkness and the sons of perdition, Mormon scripture states that "the end thereof, neither the place thereof, nor their torment, no man knows; Neither was it revealed, neither is, neither will be revealed unto man, except to them who are made partakers thereof".&lt;ref&gt;[http://scriptures.lds.org/en/dc/76/45-46#45 Doctrine and Covenants 76:45–46].&lt;/ref&gt; The scripture asserts that those who are consigned to this state will be aware of its duration and limitations.

=== Swedenborgianism ===
:''See [[Swedenborgianism#Beliefs|Swedenborgianism]]''

=== Unity Church ===
The [[Unity Church]] of Charles Fillmore considers the concept of everlasting physical Hell to be false [[doctrine]] and contradictory to that reported by [[John the Evangelist]].&lt;ref&gt;"The word ''Hell'' is not translated with clearness sufficient to represent the various meanings of the word in the original language. There are three words from which "Hell" is derived: ''Sheol'', "the unseen state"; ''Hades'', "the unseen world"; and ''Gehenna'', "Valley of Hinnom." These are used in various relations, nearly all of them allegorical. In a sermon [[Frederic William Farrar|Archdeacon Farrar]] said: "There would be the proper teaching about Hell if we calmly and deliberately erased from our English Bibles the three words, 'damnation, ' 'Hell, ' and 'everlasting. ' I say—unhesitatingly I say, claiming the fullest right to speak with the authority of knowledge—that not one of those words ought to stand any longer in our English Bible, for, in our present acceptation of them, they are simply mistranslations." This corroborates the metaphysical interpretation of Scripture, and sustains the truth that Hell is a figure of speech that represents a corrective state of mind. When error has reached its limit, the retroactive law asserts itself, and judgment, being part of that law, brings the penalty upon the transgressor. This penalty is not punishment, but discipline, and if the transgressor is truly repentant and obedient, he is forgiven in Truth.  —[[Charles Fillmore (Unity Church)|Charles Fillmore]], ''Christian Healing'', Lesson 11, item eleven."&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biblical terminology ==
; Sheol: In the [[King James Bible]], the [[Old Testament]] term ''[[Sheol]]'' is translated as "Hell" 31 times,&lt;ref&gt;Deut. 32:22, Deut. 32:36a &amp; 39, II Sam. 22:6, Job 11:8, Job 26:6, Psalm 9:17, Psalm 16:10, Psalm 18:5, Psalm 55:15, Psalm 86:13, Ps. 116:3, Psalm 139:8, Prov. 5:5, Prov. 7:27, Prov. 9:18, Prov. 15:11, Prov. 15:24, Prov. 23:14, Prov. 27:20, Isa. 5:14, Isa. 14:9, Isa. 14:15, Isa. 28:15, Isa. 28:18, Isa. 57:9, Ezek. 31:16, Ezek. 31:17, Ezek. 32:21, Ezk. 32:27, Amos 9:2, Jonah 2:2, Hab. 2:5&lt;/ref&gt; and as "the grave" 31 times.&lt;ref&gt;Gen. 37:35, Gen. 42:38, Gen. 44:29, Gen. 44:31, I Sam. 2:6, I Kings 2:6, I Kings 2:9, Job 7:9, Job 14:13, Job 17:13, Job 21:13, Job 24:19, Psalm 6:5, Psalm 30:3, Psalm 31:17, Psalm 49:14, Psalm 49:14, Psalm 49:15, Psalm 88:3, Psalm 89:48, Prov. 1:12, Prov. 30:16, Ecc. 9:10, Song 8:6, Isa. 14:11, Isa. 38:10, Isa. 38:18, Ezek. 31:15, Hosea 13:14, Hosea 13:14, Psalm 141:7&lt;/ref&gt; ''Sheol'' is also translated as "the pit" three times.&lt;ref&gt;Num. 16:30, Num. 16:33, Job 17:16&lt;/ref&gt;
: Modern translations typically render ''Sheol'' as "the grave", "the pit", or "death".

; Abaddon: The Hebrew word ''[[abaddon]]'', meaning "destruction", is sometimes interpreted as a synonym of "Hell".&lt;ref&gt;''Roget's Thesaurus'', VI. V.2, "Hell"&lt;/ref&gt;

; Gehenna: In the New Testament, both early (i.e., the [[KJV]]) and modern translations often translate ''[[Gehenna]]'' as "Hell".&lt;ref&gt;Mat. 5:29, Mat. 5:30, Matt. 10:28, Matt. 23:15, Matt. 23:33, Mark 9:43, Mark 9:45, Mark 9:47, Luke 12:5, Matt. 5:22, Matt. 18:9, Jas. 3:6&lt;/ref&gt; [[Young's Literal Translation]] and [[New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures|New World Translation]] are notable exceptions, simply using "Gehenna".

; Hades: ''[[Christian views on Hades|Hades]]'' is the Greek word traditionally used for the Hebrew word ''Sheol'' in works such as the [[Septuagint]], the Greek translations of the Hebrew Bible. Like other first-century Jews literate in Greek, Christian writers of the New Testament employed this usage. While earlier translations most often translated Hades as "Hell", as does the King James Version, modern translations use the transliteration "Hades",&lt;ref&gt;Acts 2:27, New American Standard Bible&lt;/ref&gt; or render the word as allusions "to the grave",&lt;ref&gt;Acts 2:27, New International Version&lt;/ref&gt; "among the dead",&lt;ref&gt;Acts 2:27, New Living Translation&lt;/ref&gt; "place of the dead"&lt;ref&gt;Luke 16:23, New Living Translation&lt;/ref&gt; or similar statements. In Latin, Hades could be translated as ''Purgatorium'' ([[Purgatory]]) after about 1200 AD,&lt;ref&gt;''Catholic for a Reason'', edited by Scott Hahn &amp; Leon Suprenant, copyright 1998 by Emmaus Road Publishing, Inc., chapter by Curtis Martin, pg 294-295&lt;/ref&gt; but no modern English translations render Hades as Purgatory.

; Tartarus: Appearing only in 2&amp;nbsp;Peter 2:4 in the New Testament, both early and modern translations usually translate ''[[Tartarus]]'' as "Hell", though a few render it as "Tartarus".

'''Cognitive science of religion''' is the study of religious thought and behavior from the perspective of the cognitive and evolutionary sciences. The field employs methods and theories from a very broad range of disciplines, including: [[cognitive psychology]], [[evolutionary psychology]], [[cognitive anthropology]], [[artificial intelligence]], [[neurotheology]], [[developmental psychology]], and [[archaeology]].  Scholars in this field seek to explain how human minds acquire, generate, and transmit religious thoughts, practices, and schemas by means of ordinary cognitive capacities.

==History==
Although religion has been the subject of serious scientific study since at least the late nineteenth century, the study of religion as a cognitive phenomenon is relatively recent. While it often relies upon earlier research within [[anthropology of religion]]&lt;ref&gt;Geertz C. (1966) "Religion as cultural system" In: Banton, M. (ed) ''Anthropological approaches to the study of religion'' London: Tavistock p 1-46&lt;/ref&gt; and [[sociology of religion]], cognitive science of religion considers the results of that work within the context of evolutionary and cognitive theories. As such, cognitive science of religion was only made possible by the [[cognitive revolution]] of the 1950s and the development, starting in the 1970s, of [[sociobiology]] and other approaches explaining human behaviour in evolutionary terms, especially [[evolutionary psychology]].

While [[Dan Sperber]] foreshadowed cognitive science of religion in his 1975 book ''Rethinking Symbolism'', the earliest research to fall within the scope of the discipline was published during the 1980s. Among this work, [[Stewart E. Guthrie]]'s [https://www.academia.edu/209728/A_Cognitive_Theory_of_Religion "A cognitive theory of religion"]&lt;ref&gt;''Current Anthropology'' 21 (2) 1980, pp. 181-203.&lt;/ref&gt; was significant for examining the significance of anthropomorphism within religion, work that ultimately led to the development of the concept of the [[hyperactive agency detection device]] – a key concept within cognitive science of religion.

The real beginning of cognitive science of religion can be dated to the 1990s, however. During that decade a large number of highly influential books and articles were published which helped to lay the foundations of cognitive science of religion. These included ''Rethinking Religion: Connecting Cognition and Culture'' and ''Bringing Ritual to Mind: Psychological Foundations of Cultural Forms'' by [[E. Thomas Lawson]] and [[Robert McCauley]], ''Naturalness of Religious Ideas'' by [[Pascal Boyer]], ''Inside the Cult'' and ''Arguments and Icons''&amp;nbsp;by&amp;nbsp;[[Harvey Whitehouse]], and Guthrie's book-length development of his earlier theories in ''Faces in the Clouds''. In the 1990s, these and other researchers, who had been working independently in a variety of different disciplines, discovered each other's work and found valuable parallels between their approaches, with the result that something of a self-aware research tradition began to coalesce. By 2000, the field was well-enough defined for [[Justin L. Barrett]] to coin the term 'cognitive science of religion' in his article [https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S1364-6613(99)01419-9 "Exploring the natural foundations of religion"].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Barrett|first1=Justin|title=Exploring the natural foundations of religion|journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences|date=1 January 2000|volume=4|pages=29–34|doi=10.1016/S1364-6613(99)01419-9}}&lt;!--|accessdate=5 April 2016--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2000, cognitive science of religion has grown,{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} similarly to other approaches that apply evolutionary thinking to sociological phenomena. Each year more researchers become involved in the field,{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} with theoretical and empirical developments proceeding at a very rapid pace. The field remains somewhat loosely defined, bringing together as it does researchers who come from a variety of different traditions. Much of the cohesion in the field comes not from shared detailed theoretical commitments but from a general willingness to view religion in cognitive and evolutionary terms as well as from the willingness to engage with the work of the others developing this field. A vital role in bringing together researchers is played by the [[International Association for the Cognitive Science of Religion]], formed in 2006.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

==Theoretical basis==
{{See also|Evolutionary psychology of religion}}
Despite a lack of agreement concerning the theoretical basis for work in cognitive science of religion, it is possible to outline some tendencies. Most significant of these is reliance upon the theories developed within [[evolutionary psychology]]. That particular approach to evolutionary explanations of human behaviour is particularly suitable to the cognitive byproduct explanation of religion that is most popular among cognitive scientists of religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pyysiäinen|first1=Ilkka and Marc Hauser|title=The origins of religion : evolved adaptation or by-product?|journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences|date=March 2010|volume=14|issue=3|pages=104–09|doi=10.1016/j.tics.2009.12.007}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is because of the focus on byproduct and ancestral trait explanations within evolutionary psychology. A particularly significant concept associated with this approach is [[modularity of mind]], used as it is to underpin accounts of the mental mechanisms seen to be responsible for religious beliefs. Important examples of work that falls under this rubric are provided by research carried out by [[Pascal Boyer]] and [[Justin L. Barrett]].

These theoretical commitments are not shared by all cognitive scientists of religion, however. Ongoing debates regarding the comparative advantages of different evolutionary explanations for human behaviour&lt;ref&gt;See Laland K. and Brown D. (2002) ''Sense and Nonsense: Evolutionary Perspectives on Human Behavior'' Oxford: Oxford University Press for overview.&lt;/ref&gt; find a reflection within cognitive science of religion with [[dual inheritance theory]] recently gaining adherents among researchers in the field, including [[Armin Geertz]] and [[Ara Norenzayan]]. The perceived advantage of this theoretical framework is its ability to deal with more complex interactions between cognitive and cultural phenomena, but it comes at the cost of experimental design having to take into consideration a richer range of possibilities.

==Main concepts==

===Cognitive byproduct===
The view that religious beliefs and practices should be understood as nonfunctional but as produced by human cognitive mechanisms that are functional outside of the context of religion. Examples of this are the hyperactive [[agent detection]] device and the minimally counterintuitive concepts&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icea.ox.ac.uk/fileadmin/CAM/dMinimalcounterintuitiveness.pdf Minimal counterintuitiveness]&lt;/ref&gt; or the process of initiation&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/663726/Oliver_Kress_-_A_new_approach_to_cognitive_development_ontogenesis_and_the_process_of_initiation Kress, Oliver (1993). "A new approach to cognitive development: ontogenesis and the process of initiation". Evolution and Cognition 2(4): 319-332.]&lt;/ref&gt; explaining [[buddhism]] and [[taoism]]. The cognitive byproduct explanation of religion is an application of the concept of [[spandrel (biology)]] and of the concept of  [[exaptation]] explored by [[Stephen Jay Gould]] among others.

===Minimally counterintuitive concepts===
Concepts that mostly fit human preconceptions but break with them in one or two striking ways. These concepts are both easy to remember (thanks to the counterintuitive elements) and easy to use (thanks to largely agreeing with what people expect). Examples include talking trees and noncorporeal agents. [[Pascal Boyer]] argues that many religious entities fit into this category.&lt;ref&gt;Boyer, Pascal. ''The Naturalness of Religious Ideas'' University of California Press, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; Upal&lt;ref&gt;Upal, M. A. (2010). "An Alternative View of the Minimal Counterintuitiveness Effect", ''Journal of Cognitive Systems Research'', 11(2), 194-203.&lt;/ref&gt; labelled the fact that minimally counterintuitive ideas are better remembered than intuitive and maximally counterintuitive ideas as [[the minimal counterintuitiveness effect]] or the MCI-effect.

===Hyperactive agency detection device===
[[Cognitive scientist]] [[Justin L. Barrett]] postulates that this mental mechanism, whose function is to identify the activity of agents, may contribute to belief in the presence of the supernatural. Given the relative costs of failing to spot an agent, the mechanism is said to be hyperactive, producing a large number of [[Type I and type II errors|false positive errors]]. [[Stewart E. Guthrie (scientist)|Stewart E. Guthrie]] and others have claimed these errors can explain the appearance of supernatural concepts.

===Pro-social adaptation===
According to the prosocial adaptation account of religion, religious beliefs and practices should be understood as having the function of eliciting adaptive prosocial behaviour and avoiding the [[free rider problem]]. Within the cognitive science of religion this approach is primarily pursued by [[Richard Sosis]]. [[David Sloan Wilson]] is another major proponent of this approach and interprets religion as a group-level adaptation, but his work is generally seen as falling outside the cognitive science of religion.

===Costly signaling===
Practices that, due to their inherent cost, can be relied upon to provide an [[Signalling theory#Human honest signals|honest signal]] regarding the intentions of the agent. [[Richard Sosis]] has suggested that religious practices can be explained as costly signals of the willingness to cooperate. A similar line of argument has been pursued by [[Lyle Steadman]] and [[Craig Palmer]]. Alternatively, D. Jason Slone has argued that religiosity may be a costly signal used as a [[mating strategy]] in so far as religiosity serves as a proxy for "family values."

===Dual inheritance===
In the context of cognitive science of religion, dual inheritance theory can be understood as attempting to combine the cognitive byproduct and prosocial adaptation accounts using the theoretical approach developed by [[Robert Boyd (anthropologist)|Robert Boyd]] and [[Peter Richerson]], among others. The basic view is that while belief in supernatural entities is a cognitive byproduct, cultural traditions have recruited such beliefs to motivate prosocial behaviour. A sophisticated statement of this approach can be found in [[Scott Atran]] and [[Joseph Henrich]] (2010) [http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1162/BIOT_a_00018 "The Evolution of Religion: How Cognitive By-Products, Adaptive Learning Heuristics, Ritual Displays, and Group Competition Generate Deep Commitments to Prosocial Religions"] ''Biological Theory'' 5.1.

The '''common squirrel monkey''' (''Saimiri sciureus'') is a small [[New World monkey]] of the family [[Cebidae]], native to the tropical areas of [[South America]].

==Range and introductions==
The common squirrel monkey can be found primarily in the [[Amazon Basin]], including territories in the countries of [[Brazil]], [[Colombia]], [[Ecuador]], [[French Guiana]], [[Guyana]], [[Peru]], [[Suriname]] and [[Venezuela]];&lt;ref name=iucn/&gt; a small population has been introduced to [[Florida]] and many of the Caribbean Islands.&lt;ref&gt;LONG JL 2003. Introduced Mammals of the World: Their History, Distribution and Influence (Cabi Publishing) by John L. Long ({{ISBN|9780851997483}}).&lt;/ref&gt; A group of free-ranging individuals was spotted and photographed in 2009 at the [[Tijuca Forest]] in [[Rio de Janeiro]] – possibly the result of an illegal release or of an escape from the pet trade;&lt;ref&gt;''O Globo'', 4 May 2009, Ancelmo Gois column&lt;/ref&gt; by 2010, the squirrel monkey had begun to be considered as an [[invasive species]] in the Brazilian [[Atlantic rainforest]], and concerns were expressed about its role as a predator of eggs of endangered bird species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://oglobo.globo.com/ciencia/mat/2010/05/24/especies-invasoras-estao-entre-as-maiores-vilas-da-biodiversidade-916670575.asp | title = Espécies invasoras estão entre as maiores vilãs da biodiversidade | work = O Globo | date = 25 May 2010 | language = pt}}&lt;/ref&gt; The common squirrel monkey prefers to live in the middle canopy, but occasionally comes to the ground or goes up into the high canopy. They like vegetation which provides good cover from birds of prey in the rainforest, savannah, mangroves, or marshlands.

At least five populations of common squirrel monkeys have existed in Florida since the 1960s, if not earlier.&lt;ref name=Simberloff161&gt;{{cite book |title= Strangers in Paradise: Impact and Management of Nonindigenous Species in Florida|last= Simberloff|first= Daniel|authorlink= Daniel Simberloff|author2=Schmitz, D.C. |author3=Brown, T.C. |year= 1997|publisher= Island Press|isbn= 1-55963-430-8|page= 161|url= https://books.google.com/?id=rtrpSllq4SQC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate= September 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Common squirrel monkeys have been established at [[Silver Springs (attraction)|Silver Springs]] since at least the late 1960s; [[rhesus macaque]]s were established in the area by 1938, but there is no firm information on when the squirrel monkeys were released.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Strangers in Paradise: Impact and Management of Nonindigenous Species in Florida|last= Simberloff|first= Daniel|authorlink= Daniel Simberloff|author2=Schmitz, D.C. |author3=Brown, T.C. |year= 1997|publisher= Island Press|isbn= 1-55963-430-8|pages= 161–164|url= https://books.google.com/?id=rtrpSllq4SQC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate= September 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1960s, a colony of twelve to fifteen common squirrel monkeys was noted residing in a [[Hammock (ecology)|hammock]] of trees by the springs; they migrated downstream to the [[Ocklawaha River]] by 1975. Another population, derived from two pairs released in the 1960s, lives on the Bartlett Estate in [[Broward County, Florida|Broward County]]; they numbered 43 in 1988. In 1976, 15 squirrel monkeys escaped from the Tropic Wonderland attraction in [[Titusville, Florida]]; their descendants have since become established in the area. In the 1980s, 500 and 1000 common squirrel monkeys remained in the shuttered Masterpiece Gardens park in [[Polk County, Florida|Polk County]], persisting despite efforts to capture them. Additionally, a "semi-free-ranging" population has existed at Monkey Jungle in [[Goulds, Florida|Goulds]] in [[Miami-Dade County]] since 1960.&lt;ref name=Simberloff161/&gt;

==Biology and behavior==

===Diet===
The common squirrel monkey is considered both [[frugivorous]] and [[insectivorous]], preferring berry-like fruit on branches. When in captivity, squirrel monkeys are fed fruits such as apples, oranges, grapes, and bananas. They also consume a variety of vegetables that include lettuce, celery, and onions.&lt;ref name=Petrucci&gt;{{cite journal | author = Petrucci, S.T. | year = 1993 | title = Observations of the Foraging Behavior of Squirrel Monkeys (''Saimiri sciureus boliviensis'') at the Tulsa Zoological Park | journal = Bios | volume = 64 | issue = 3 | pages = 64–71 | jstor = 4608213}}&lt;/ref&gt; Squirrel monkeys also look for insects and small vertebrates, such as [[tree frog]]s. It obtains a majority of its water from the foods eaten, and also obtains water from holes in trees and puddles on the ground. When fruit is scarce, the common squirrel monkey drinks nectar.

The amount of time squirrel monkeys spend foraging depends on the type of food. When bigger fruits and easy access occur, they do not spend much time foraging. Otherwise, they dedicate a considerable amount of time to looking for their foods. Foraging also keeps the monkeys entertained and active. Oftentimes when they are captive, they easily become bored as the food is more easily obtained.&lt;ref name=Petrucci/&gt;

===Social behavior===
The common squirrel monkey is polygamous with a multiple-male, multiple-female group structure.&lt;ref name=Mitchell&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1163/156853994X00514 | author = Mitchell C.L. | year = 1994 | title = Migration alliances and coalitions among adult male South American squirrel monkeys (Saimiri sciureus) | journal = Behaviour | volume = 130 | issue = 3-4 | pages = 169–190}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most social interactions in ''S. sciureus'' groups occur within the various age/sex classes,&lt;ref name=Baldwin&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1159/000155184 | author = Baldwin J.D. | year = 1968 | title = The social behavior of adult male squirrel monkeys (''Saimiri sciureus'') in a semi-natural environment | journal = Folia Primatologica | volume = 9 | pages = 281–314 | pmid=4975594}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the division of classes being between adult male categories, mother-infant categories, and juvenile categories.&lt;ref name=Mitchell/&gt; The core of the group is made up of the adult females and their young.&lt;ref name=Anschel&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1159/000155519 |author1=Anschel S. |author2=Talmage-Riggs G. | year = 1973 | title = Homosexual behavior and dominance hierarchy in a group of captive female squirrel monkeys (''Saimiri sciureus'') | journal = Folia Primatologica | volume = 19 | issue = 3 | pages = 61–72 | pmid=4198058}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of the natural attraction each class has to the adult females, the different age/sex classes come together as one social group.&lt;ref name=Baldwin/&gt; Though juveniles play and jump around an appreciable amount during phases of high activity, they usually stay close to the adult females.&lt;ref name=Baldwin/&gt; In terms of the males’ level of attraction to the adult females, the phase of the yearly reproductive cycle determines their distance from the adult females.&lt;ref name=Baldwin/&gt; Overall, interactions between the various age/sex classes are most frequently directed to adult females.&lt;ref name=Baldwin/&gt; The division of age/sex classes among ''S. sciureus'' is not so strictly defined because the degree of segregation between sexes can vary. That is, those subspecies which have a high degree of sexual dimorphism are sexually segregated, such that the males and females of that subspecies interact less with each other than do those of subspecies that are not very sexually dimorphic and thus sexually integrated.&lt;ref name=Levine&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Levine S. |author2=Lowe E.L. |author3=Mendoza S.P. | year = 1978 | title = Social organization and social behavior in two subspecies of squirrel monkey (''Saimiri sciureus'') | journal = Folia Primatologica | volume = 30 | pages = 126–144 | doi=10.1159/000155859}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Seasonal reproduction&lt;ref name=Mitchell/&gt; plays a major role in the social behavior of ''S. sciureus'', where the frequency of between-sex interactions of the males and females differs between the birth season and the mating season.&lt;ref name=Aruguete&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Aruguete M.S. |author2=Mason W.A. | year = 1996 | title = Effect of infants on adult social relations in the squirrel monkey (''Saimiri sciureus'') | journal = Psychological Reports | volume = 79 | issue = 2 | pages = 603–611 | pmid = 8909087 | doi=10.2466/pr0.1996.79.2.603}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adult males are generally socially inactive during the birth season and spend their time travelling and foraging at a distance from the group.&lt;ref name=Aruguete/&gt; During the mating season, though, the adult males become fatter, excited, aggressive, and highly vocal and spend most of their time engaging in dominance interactions among themselves or following and approaching the adult females in estrus, in hopes of being able to mate with them.&lt;ref name=Baldwin/&gt; Males can increase their chances at copulating with receptive females by approaching them quietly.&lt;ref name=Baldwin/&gt; Nonreceptive females, though, respond aggressively to any male approach and threaten and chase the males away, usually with the help of surrounding females.&lt;ref name=Baldwin/&gt; Overall, intersexual interaction among ''S. sciureus'' greatly increases during the mating season.&lt;ref name= Anderson&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/0018-506X(77)90025-3 |author1=Anderson C.O. |author2=Mason W.A. | year = 1977 | title = Hormones and social behavior of squirrel monkeys (''Saimiri sciureus''): effects of endocrine status of females on behavior within heterosexual pairs | journal = Hormones and Behavior | volume = 8 | issue = 1 | pages = 100–106 | pmid = 405304}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Saimiri sciureus'' infants develop rapidly. They become fairly independent between five and eight months of age and spend only a small percentage of the day with their mothers. Also at this age range, the infants can find food on their own.&lt;ref name=Aruguete/&gt; Infants are active members of the social group, climbing, running, exploring, and frequently making contact with adult members of the group.&lt;ref name=Aruguete/&gt; Most adult-infant interactions are initiated by infants towards adult females that are not their mothers.&lt;ref name=Aruguete/&gt; Adults generally respond to the infants calmly, but some adults may respond with antagonism.&lt;ref name=Aruguete/&gt; Infants rank the lowest in the group.&lt;ref name=Boinski2002&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1163/156853902760102663 |author1=Boinski S. |author2=Cropp S. |author3=Henry M. |author4=Quatrone R. |author5=Selvaggi L. |author6=Sughrue K. | year = 2002 | title = An expanded test of the ecological model of primate social evolution: Competitive regimes and female bonding in three species of squirrel monkeys (''Saimiri oerstedii'', ''S. boliviensis'', and ''S. sciureus'') | journal = Behaviour | volume = 139 | pages = 227–261}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many other aspects of ''S. sciureus'' social behavior, such as dominance relationships, [[coalitions]], dispersal patterns, and aggression, stem from the feeding ecology of the animals.&lt;ref name=Boinski2002/&gt; Feeding ecology directly affects the females of the group which in turn affects the behavior of the males in the group.&lt;ref name=Boinski1991&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Mitchel, C.

Once sexually mature, all males emigrate from their natal groups. After leaving, they may either become solitary, a peripheral of another troop, join another mixed-sex troop, or attend a tolerant troop of another monkey species. If they become a peripheral of another group, the male squirrel monkey chooses one troop and keeps a certain distance away from them while still trying to follow them. These males are the less dominant ones. A few male squirrel monkeys have been observed interacting with groups of other monkey species. Some females may leave their natal groups, as well, although they tend to be more philopatric. If females do leave their natal groups, they do it after becoming sexually mature. Often, they migrate before or right after a mating season. Due to this, they might end up leaving their group when they are pregnant or with their immature offspring.&lt;ref name=Boinski&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Boinski, S. |author2=Ehmke, E. |author3=Kauffman, L. |author4=Schet, S. |author5=Vreedzam, A. | year = 2005 | title = Dispersal Patterns among Three Species of Squirrel Monkeys (''Saimiri oerstedii'', ''S. boliviensis'' and ''S. sciureus''): II.

Males are typically dominant to females, but females still have a high status in the group.&lt;ref name=Mitchell/&gt; and are capable of forming coalitions against dominant males.&lt;ref name=Clark&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1007/BF02373233 |author1=Clark D.L. |author2=Stevens J.J. |author3=Wooley M.J. | year = 1978 | title = Squirrel monkey dominance and social behavior as related to group size and group structure | journal = Primates | volume = 19 | issue = 1 | pages = 169–177}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rarely do males form coalitions even if a group of males keeps their distance from the main group or are solitary. Several theories suggest that one of the reasons that male squirrel monkeys do not form coalitions is because of the lack of kinship due to emigration. Coalitions may also increase mortality risks within the group since males tend to be aggressive to each other.&lt;ref name=Boinski/&gt;

{{anchor|Genital display}}
Genital display among males is an important social signal in relation to group hierarchy; it is derived from [[animal sexual behavior|sexual behavior]], but is used for social communication.&lt;ref name=Blitz/&gt; It involves the animal spreading his thighs and having an erect penis.&lt;ref name=Blitz&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1159/000164879 |author1=Blitz, J. |author2=Ploog, D.

===Habits===
The common squirrel monkey is [[Diurnality|diurnal]]. It is usually quiet, but will utter loud cries when alarmed. It uses different types of calls for specific situations. Some of their common call types include caws, bawls, and shrieks. Squirrel monkeys utter caws mostly when they are trying to defend a territory. They may use bawls prior to a fight, as well as after one. Shrieks are mainly heard when the monkeys are fighting for dominance. Squirrel monkeys’ most common calls are determined by their genetics. Squirrel monkeys that have been isolated since infancy are able to produce the same calls as those that have been exposed to the calls. Few variations exist between the frequencies of the calls of infants that were raised differently. A squirrel monkey that was deaf since birth was also able to produce the same calls, proving that the calls come from their genes.&lt;ref name=Kurt&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Hammerschmidt, K. |author2=Freudenstein, T. |author3=Jurgens, U. | year = 2001 | title = Vocal Development in Squirrel Monkeys | journal = Behaviour | volume = 138 | issue = 9 | pages = 1179–1204 | doi=10.1163/156853901753287190 | jstor = 4535882}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is arboreal, but sometimes it comes down to the ground. Bands or troops can number from 12-100. Occasionally, troops as large as 500 have been seen in undisturbed forests.

==Conservation status==
The common squirrel monkey is rated as "least concern" by [[IUCN]],&lt;ref name=iucn/&gt; but is among many rainforest animals whose status may be harmed by [[deforestation]]. The species has also been captured extensively for the pet trade and for medical research.

==As pets==
Due to its inquisitive nature this species is a popular [[pet]] and it requires a large amount of space and food.

==Subspecies==
The four subspecies of ''S. sciureus'' are:
* ''S. s. sciureus''
* ''S. s. albigena''
* Humboldt's squirrel monkey, ''S. s. cassiquiarensis''
* Ecuadorian squirrel monkey, ''S. s. macrodon'' [http://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/site/accounts/information/Saimiri_sciureus.html ''Saimiri sciureus''], [[Animal Diversity Web]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4103">'''Continued process verification''' (CPV) is the collection and analysis of end-to-end production components and processes data to ensure product outputs are within predetermined quality limits. In 2011 the [[Food and Drug Administration]] published a report&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Process Validation: General Principles and Practices |url=http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/Guidances/UCM070336.pdf |publisher=FDA |accessdate= 3 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; outlining best practices regarding business process validation in the [[pharmaceutical industry]]. Continued process verification is outlined in this report as the third stage in [[process validation]]. Its central purpose is to ensure that processes are in a constant state of control, thus ensuring final product quality. Central to effective CPV is a method with which to identify unwanted process inconsistencies in order to execute corrective or preventative measures. Once quality standards are set in place they must be monitored with regular frequency to confirm those parameters are being met. Continued process verification not only helps protect consumers from production faults, but business also see benefits in implementing a CPV program. Should product outputs not match target standards it can be very costly to investigate the problem source without existing CPV data.

==Vital components of continued process verification==
* An alert system to identify process malfunctions that lead to deviations from quality standards. 
* A framework for gathering and analyzing data of final product quality and process consistency.  Analysis should include source materials consistency and manufacturing equipment condition; and data should be collected in a format that allows for long term trend analysis as well as intra-production quality analysis.
* Continued review of quality qualification standards and process reliability. Departures from any predetermined standards should be flagged for review by trained personnel and appropriate measures undertaken to restore end-to-end quality standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Trust but Verify (Continuously)|url=http://www2.emersonprocess.com/siteadmincenter/PM%20Articles/ART-Trust-but-Verify.pdf|publisher=Pharmaceutical Manufacturing|accessdate=3 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Data collection and analysis==
Crucial in effective CPV implementation is an appropriate data collection procedure. Data must allow for statistical analytics and trend analysis of process consistency and capability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Continued Process Verification (CPV)|url=http://www.atris-systems.com/216.0.html|publisher=Atris Information Systems|accessdate=3 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A correctly implemented procedure will minimize overreactions to individual production outlier events and guarantee genuine process inconsistency are detected. While production variability can sometimes be obvious and even casually identified the FDA recommends using statistical tools to quantitatively detect problems and identify root causes. Initially, continued process verification should be based on quality standards established in the design phase. After a period of time variations can be detected by identifying deviation from historical data using statistical tools. Furthermore, these same tools can also be used to identify opportunities to optimize processes that may pre-emptively increase quality reliability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Case for Stage 3 Continued Process Verification|url=http://www.pharmamanufacturing.com/articles/2014/stage3-continued-process-verification|publisher=Pharmaceutical Manufacturing|accessdate=3 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Crime]] and [[violence]] affect the lives of millions of people in Latin America. Some consider social inequality to be a major contributing factor to levels of violence in Latin America,&lt;ref&gt;"World Bank research convincingly demoinequality, which has worsened in Latin America in the past decade and is unlikely to improve dramatically in the years ahead." - Prillaman (2003:1)&lt;/ref&gt; where the state fails to prevent crime and organized crime takes over State control in areas where the State is unable to assist the society such as in impoverished communities. In the years following the transitions from authoritarianism to democracy, crime and violence have become major problems in Latin America.

Several studies indicated the existence of an epidemic in the region; the [[Pan American Health Organization]] called violence in Latin America "the social [[pandemic]] of the 20th century."&lt;ref&gt;Cesar Chelala, ''Violence in the Americas: The Social Pandemic of the 20th Century'' (Washington, D.C.: Pan American Health Organization, 1997).&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from the direct human cost, the rise in crime and violence has imposed significant social costs and has made much more difficult the processes of [[economic development|economic]] and [[social development]], [[democratic consolidation]] and regional integration in the [[Americas]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://laii.unm.edu/conference/mesquita.php LAII: Crime, Violence and Democracy in Latin America&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071103102210/http://laii.unm.edu/conference/mesquita.php |date=2007-11-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:LatinAmericaViolence.svg|thumb|400px|right|Numerous factors have caused the immensely high crime rates in Latin America. Two significant factors that have been influencing violence are high poverty rates and consistently high amounts of drug trafficking. Data: UNODC, 2012.]]

==Consequences for the region==
High rates of crime and violence in Latin America are undermining growth, threatening human welfare, and impeding social development, according to [[World Bank]] and the [[United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime]] (UNODC).&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/COUNTRIES/LACEXT/0,,contentMDK:21320803~pagePK:146736~piPK:226340~theSitePK:258554,00.html Latin America and Caribbean - Crime, Violence, and Development: Trends, Costs, and Policy Options in the Caribbean&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
Latin America is caught in a vicious circle, where economic growth is thwarted by high crime rates, and insufficient economic opportunity contributes to high crime.{{Citation needed|date=May 2014}} Crime and violence thrives as the rule of law is weak, economic opportunity is scarce, and education is poor. Therefore, effectively addressing crime requires a holistic, multi-sectoral approach that addresses its root social, political, and economic causes.

Recent statistics indicate that crime is becoming the biggest problem in Latin America.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.iadb.org/res/consultasanjose/files/summary_sp/violence_summary.pdf|title=Violence and Crime in Latin America|accessdate=28 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amnesty International has declared Latin America as the most dangerous region in the world for journalists to work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.cnn.com/2011/WORLD/americas/05/12/americas.press.freedom/index.html|title=Amnesty International: Latin America 'dangerous' for journalists|accessdate=30 August 2013 | work=CNN|date=13 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Mexico, armed gangs of rival drug smugglers have been fighting it out with one another, thus creating new hazards in rural areas. Crime is extremely high in all of the major cities in [[Brazil]]. Wealthy citizens have had to provide for their own security. In large parts of [[Rio de Janeiro]], armed criminal gangs are said to be in control. Crime statistics were high in [[El Salvador]], [[Guatemala]] and [[Venezuela]] during 1996. The police have not been able to handle the work load and the military have been called in to assist in these countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://prezi.com/-ryl7lygh6kh/latin-america-what-i-want-to-change/]&lt;/ref&gt; There was a very distinct crime wave happening in Latin America.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.emergency.com/ltn-scty.htm Security Problems in Latin America&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The city that currently topped the list of the world's most violent cities is [[San Pedro Sula]] in [[Honduras]], leading various media sources to label it the "murder capital of the world."&lt;ref name=CNNmurder2013&gt;Rafael Romo and Nick Thompson, [http://www.cnn.com/2013/03/27/world/americas/honduras-murder-capital Inside San Pedro Sula, the 'murder capital' of the world], CNN, March 28, 2013, accessed April 30, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NYDNmurder2013&gt;Carol Kuruvilla, [http://www.nydailynews.com/news/crime/honduran-city-murder-capital-world-report-article-1.1303512 San Pedro Sula in northwest Honduras is the murder capital of the world: report], ''New York Daily News'', March 30, 2013, accessed April 30, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Reutersmurder2013&gt;Jorge Cabrera, [http://blogs.reuters.com/photographers-blog/2013/04/05/life-and-death-in-the-murder-capital/ Life and death in the murder capital], Reuters, April 5, 2013, accessed April 30, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=FOXmurder2013&gt;[http://latino.foxnews.com/latino/news/2013/02/08/honduran-city-is-world-murder-capital-juarez-drops-for-second-year-in-row/ Honduran City is World Murder Capital; Juarez Drops for Second Year in a Row], Fox News Latino, February 8, 2013, accessed April 30, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Colombia registered a homicide rate of 24.4 per 100,000 in 2016, the lowest since 1974.

The [[Inter-American Development Bank]] estimates that Latin America's per capita [[Gross Domestic Product]] would be twenty-five percent higher if the region's crime rates were equal to the world average.{{Update after|2010|11}} Similarly, the [[World Bank]] has identified a strong correlation between crime and [[income inequality]].&lt;ref&gt;http://siteresources.worldbank.org/DEC/Resources/Crime&amp;Inequality.pdf FAJNZYLBER et al, "Inequality and law", Journal of Law and Economics, vol. XLV (April 2002)&lt;/ref&gt; Business associations in the region rank crime as the number one issue negatively affecting trade and investment. Crime-related violence also represents the most important threat to public health, striking more victims than [[HIV/AIDS]] or other infectious diseases.&lt;ref&gt;[http://usinfo.state.gov/dhr/Archive/2005/Apr/21-965427.html Crime Hinders Development, Democracy in Latin America, U.S. Says - US Department of State&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080213142246/http://usinfo.state.gov/dhr/Archive/2005/Apr/21-965427.html |date=2008-02-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Complexo do Alemão.jpg|thumb|240px|right|A [[Favela]] (slum) in [[Rio de Janeiro]].]]
Public faith in democracy itself is under threat as governments are perceived as unable to deliver basic services such as public security. A [[United Nations]] report revealed that only 43 percent of Latin Americans are fully supportive of democracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://pdfs.postprefix.com/venezuela/demoalt.pdf|title=The Bolivarian Government of Hugo Chávez: Democratic Alternative for Latin America?|accessdate=29 August 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6K8hSEWNr?url=http://pdfs.postprefix.com/venezuela/demoalt.pdf|archivedate=5 October 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crime has rapidly risen to the top of the list of citizen concerns in Latin America.

Massive street marches such as those that took place in [[Argentina]], Mexico, and [[Brazil]], and other expressions of protest against violence, have made it increasingly difficult for politicians to avoid dealing with the issue and, in many countries, have made tackling crime a central theme in political party platforms across the region. Several leaders in the region, including El Salvador's [[Tony Saca]], [[Ricardo Maduro]] in Honduras, Guatemala's [[Óscar Berger]], and [[Álvaro Uribe]] in Colombia, have all campaigned on a strong anti-crime message.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} The Presidents of [[Honduras]] and [[El Salvador]] have called gangs ''([[mara (gang)|maras]])'' as big a threat to national security in their countries as terrorism is to the United States.&lt;ref name=CrimeandGangs1/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/09/26/international/americas/26honduras.html?pagewanted=print&amp;position=&amp;_r=0|title=Shuttling Between Nations, Latino Gangs Confound the Law|accessdate=29 August 2013 | work=The New York Times|first=Ginger|last=Thompson|date=26 September 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"World Bank researchers have demonstrated the existence of a 'criminal inertia,' in which high rates of criminality endure long after the latent socioeconomic causes have disappeared or been addressed through policy interventions."&lt;ref&gt;WC Prillaman (2003), "[http://www.csis.org/files/media/csis/pubs/ppcrime_democracy_inlatinamerica%5B1%5D.pdf Crime, democracy, and development in Latin America]," ''Policy Papers on the Americas''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;see Daniel Lederman, Norman Loayza, and Ana María Menendez, “Violent Crime: Does Social Capital Matter?” Economic Development and Cultural Change 3 (April 2002): 509–539; Richard Rosenfeld, Steven F. Messner, and Eric P. Baumer, Social Capital and Homicide (Saint Louis:University of Missouri Department of Criminology and Criminal Justice, 1999).&lt;/ref&gt;

Another reason critics believe fuels crime in Latin America is due to the poor public primary education system they say it "has given rise to youths without jobs or expectations of employment-thereby fueling the mounting problem of gang violence in Central America, Mexico, Jamaica, Trinidad, Colombia and Brazil." &lt;ref&gt;__."Crime Hinders Development, Democracy in Latin America, U.S. Says".

==Contributing factors==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Rocinha and Sao Conrado.jpg|thumb|340px|[[Rocinha]] [[slum]] contrasting with luxurious condos of [[São Conrado]].]] --&gt;


A series of factors have contributed to the increase in violent crime in Latin America since the transitions from [[authoritarianism]] to [[democracy]]. Some intrinsic factors and characteristics of each country aggravated the problem in some countries. However, some factors might have increased the risk of crime and violence in many or most countries in the region in the period between the 1980s and 1990s:&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

* High levels of [[social inequality]]
* [[Civil wars]] and armed [[War|conflicts]]
* Low rates of economic growth
* High [[unemployment]] rates
* Rapid growth of large cities and metropolitan areas
* Absence/weakness of basic urban infrastructure, basic social services and community organizations in the poorest neighborhoods, in the periphery of large cities and metropolitan areas
* Growing availability of [[Weapons|arms]] and [[drugs]]
* Growing presence and strengthening of [[organized crime]]
* Culture of violence, reinforced by [[organized crime]] as well as the [[Mass media|media]], the [[police]] and the private security services
* Low level of effectiveness of the [[police]] and other institutions in the [[criminal justice]] system
* Poor public education system.

==Nations with high crime rates==

===Brazil===
{{main|Crime in Brazil}}

Brazil is one of the countries that has the largest inequality in terms of the gap between the very wealthy and the extremely destitute. A huge portion of the population lives in poverty. According to the World Bank, "one-fifth of Brazil's 173 million people account for only a 2.2 percent share of the national income. Brazil is second only to South Africa in a world ranking of [[income inequality]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/COUNTRIES/LACEXT/BRAZILEXTN/0,,menuPK:322351~pagePK:141132~piPK:141107~theSitePK:322341,00.html#Challenges Brazil - Country Brief&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The incidence of violent crime, including muggings, armed robbery, murder and sexual assault is high, particularly in [[Rio de Janeiro]], [[Recife]] and other large cities. [[Carjacking]] is also common, particularly in major cities. Criminals often use guns. Gang-related violence is common throughout the [[State of São Paulo]]. Crime levels in slum areas are very high.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} Victims have been seriously injured or killed when resisting perpetrators. During peak tourist seasons, large, organised criminal gangs have reportedly robbed and assaulted beach goers.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} The country is well known for having almost 60,000 documented murders every year for the past decade, mostly drug and robbery related.

'Express kidnappings', where individuals are abducted and forced to withdraw funds from [[automated teller machine]]s to secure their release, are common in major cities including [[Rio de Janeiro]], [[São Paulo]], [[Brasília]], [[Salvador, Bahia|Salvador]] and [[Recife]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} People have been robbed and assaulted when using unregistered taxis. Petty crime such as pickpocketing and bag snatching are common. Thieves operate in outdoor markets, in hotels and on public transport. Piracy occurs in the coastal areas of Brazil.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

===Colombia===
{{main|Crime in Colombia}}
Elements of all the armed groups have been involved in drug-trafficking. In a country where the presence of the state has always been weak, the result has been a grinding war on multiple fronts, with the civilian population caught in the crossfire and often deliberately targeted for "collaborating". Human rights advocates blame [[Right-wing paramilitarism in Colombia|paramilitaries]] for massacres, "disappearances", and cases of torture and forced displacement. Rebel groups such as the [[FARC]] and the [[National Liberation Army (Colombia)|ELN]] are behind assassinations, kidnapping and extortion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/1738963.stm | work=BBC News | title=Q&amp;A: Colombia's civil conflict | date=December 23, 2009 | accessdate=April 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The level of drug related violence was halved in the last 10 years, when the country moved from being the most violent country in the world to have a homicide rate that is inferior to the one registered in countries like [[Honduras]], [[Jamaica]], [[El Salvador]], [[Venezuela]], [[Guatemala]], [[Trinidad and Tobago]] and [[South Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;[[List of countries by intentional homicide rate]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The administration of President [[Álvaro Uribe|Uribe]] has sought to professionalize the [[Military Forces of Colombia|armed forces]] and to engage them more fully in the counterinsurgency war; as a result, the armed groups have suffered a series of setbacks. [[Police of Colombia|Police in Colombia]] say the number of people kidnapped has fallen 92% since 2000. Common criminals are now the perpetrators of the overwhelming majority of kidnappings. By the year 2016, the number of kidnappings in Colombia had declined to 205 and it continues to decline.&lt;ref name = "92%"&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-38450688|title= Colombia kidnappings down 92% since 2000, police say|publisher = bbc.com|date = 28 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Military Personnel2"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.mindefensa.gov.co/irj/go/km/docs/Mindefensa/Documentos/descargas/estudios%20sectoriales/info_estadistica/Logros_Sector_Defensa.pdf|title= Military Personnel – Logros de la Política Integral de Seguridad y Defensa para la Prosperidad|language= Spanish|publisher= mindefensa.gov.co|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20150413195638/http://www.mindefensa.gov.co/irj/go/km/docs/Mindefensa/Documentos/descargas/estudios%20sectoriales/info_estadistica/Logros_Sector_Defensa.pdf|archivedate= 2015-04-13|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In general, and you are much more likely to encounter a Colombian army checkpoint than an illegal guerrilla roadblock.

Colombia registered a homicide rate of 24.4 per 100,000 in 2016, the lowest since 1974. The 40-year low in murders came the same year that the Colombian government signed a [[Colombian peace process|peace agreement]] with the FARC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.insightcrime.org/news-analysis/insight-crime-2016-homicide-round-up|title=  InSight Crime's 2016 Homicide Round-up|publisher = insightcrime.org|date = 16 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===El Salvador===
{{main|Crime in El Salvador}}
[[File:Atardecer de San Salvador desde Los Planes de Renderos.jpg|thumb|right|350px|San Salvador City at night]]
Violent crime is rampant in El Salvador, in 2015 the homicide rate peaked at 105 homicides per 100,000 residents.  In 2016, the rate decreased by 20%, but El Salvador continues to be one of the world's most dangerous countries. &lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20160517233219/http://abcnews.go.com/International/el-salvador-murder-capital-world-gang-violence-life/story?id=39177963 Crime and Violence: Regional Case Studies: El Salvador&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; As of March 2012, El Salvador has seen a 40% drop in crime due to what the Salvadoran government called a gang truce.

Violent crime including armed robbery, banditry, assault, kidnapping, sexual assault, and carjacking is common, including in the capital, San Salvador. Downtown [[San Salvador]] is dangerous, particularly at night. Public safety is no laughing matter, San Salvador hosts one of the most notorious unified crime family transnational gangs that spread across the Central American heart region, like the [[Mara Salvatrucha]] and the [[18th Street gang]] that arrived during and since the [[Salvadoran Civil War]].

The security situation has taken a downturn in San Salvador; in 2002, there were over 9000 intentional homicides in the city of San Salvador by international global Central American Gangs or Maras. 2005 and 2006 saw a worsening security situation in San Salvador; and corruption, with the trend continuing in 2008. Crimes have increased to 13 daily, with this sharp increase having occurred in the last six years, making the words San Salvador City synonymous with crime. The portrayal of San Salvador was a dark and foreboding metropolis rife and reign with crime, grime, corruption, and a deep-seated sense of urban decay, ultimately a vice city.

After the civil war and left in complete ruins and destruction, people described and called the city "San Salvador La Ciudad Que Se Desmorona", "San Salvador The City That Crumbles". San Salvador is a rampant and recurring corruption within the city's civil authorities and infrastructure. Certain locations disputed by rival gangs especially in poor slums on the outskirts areas of San Salvador City are labeled as [[No man's land]].

High-level corruption in El Salvador is a serious problem. President [[Mauricio Funes]] pledged to investigate and prosecute corrupt senior officials when he took office in June, 2009, but after a political truce with his predecessor, [[Antonio Saca]], who was expelled from the ARENA party amid large-scale corruption allegations, Funes showed an unwillingness to tackle the problem. ARENA alleged that $219 million in government funds under Saca's personal control had disappeared.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cablegatesearch.net/cable.php?id=09SANSALVADOR1103 United States Embassy San Salvador, "ARENA Expels Former President Saca," classified diplomatic cable CONFIDENTIAL, 15 December 2009, WikiLeaks ID #240031].&lt;/ref&gt; Saca's own former political allies in the ARENA party and private sector told the U.S. Embassy in San Salvador of widespread abuse of power for personal financial gain. Such corruption, the U.S. Embassy reported in a cable leaked by [[WikiLeaks]], "went beyond the pale" even by Salvadoran standards.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cablegatesearch.net/cable.php?id=09SANSALVADOR947 United States Embassy San Salvador, "Reorganizing ARENA: The Party's Future After Avila's Defeat," classified diplomatic cable SECRET/NOFORN, 6 October 2010, WikiLeaks ID #228629] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120603032809/http://cablegatesearch.net/cable.php?id=09SANSALVADOR947 |date=3 June 2012 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Honduras===
{{main|Crime in Honduras}}
[[File:SanPedroSula.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Crime is particularly high in Honduras' second city and industrial heartland, [[San Pedro Sula]]]]
Crime is a major problem in [[Honduras]], which has the highest murder rate of any nation. There are reports that after the [[2009 Honduran coup d'état]], there was a large increase in crime and violence.&lt;ref&gt;''[[CounterPunch]]'', 16 August 2010, [http://www.counterpunch.org/reichard08162010.html US Embraces Honduran Thugocracy]&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime]], Honduras has the highest rate of intentional homicide in the world, with 6,239 intentional homicides, or 82.1 per 100,000 of population in 2010. This is significantly higher than the rate in [[El Salvador]], which at 66.0 per 100,000 in 2010, has the second highest rate of intentional homicide in the world.&lt;ref name="2011 Global Study on Homicide"&gt;This increased further to 7,104 homicides in 2011.

According to the [[International Crisis Group]], the most violent regions outside of the major urban areas in [[Honduras]] exist on the border with [[Guatemala]], and are highly correlated with the many active drug trafficking routes plying the region.&lt;ref&gt;International Crisis Group.

===Mexico===
{{main|Crime in Mexico}}

Crime is among the most urgent concerns facing [[Mexico]], as Mexican [[drug trafficking]] rings play a major role in the flow of [[cocaine]], [[heroin]], and [[marijuana]] transiting between [[Latin America]] and the [[United States]]. Drug trafficking has contributed to [[Political corruption|corruption]], which has had a deleterious effect on Mexico's Federal Representative Republic. Drug trafficking and [[organized crime]] have also been a major source of [[violent crime]] in Mexico.

Mexico has experienced increasingly high [[crime rates]], especially in major urban centers. The country's great economic polarization has stimulated criminal activity in the lower [[socioeconomic]] strata, which include the majority of the country's population. Crime continues at high levels, and is repeatedly marked by violence, especially in the cities of [[Tijuana]] and [[Ciudad Juárez]], and the states of [[Baja California]], [[Durango]], [[Sinaloa]], [[Guerrero]], [[Chihuahua (state)|Chihuahua]], [[Michoacán]], [[Tamaulipas]], and [[Nuevo León]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=El narco se expande en México |url=http://news.newamericamedia.org/news/view_article.html?article_id=937be705b8bb9a53102ce6df63c36ec1 |accessdate=7 October 2011 |newspaper=New America Media |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111125160412/http://news.newamericamedia.org/news/view_article.html?article_id=937be705b8bb9a53102ce6df63c36ec1 |archivedate=November 25, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other metropolitan areas have lower, yet still serious, levels of crime. Low apprehension and conviction rates contribute to the high crime rate.

Before the drug war in Mexico, there were roughly 300 murders in the border city of Ciudad Juarez in 2007. In 2010, state officials reported a peak of 3,622 homicides in the city. With a rate of 272 murders per 100,000 residents, Ciudad Juarez alone had the highest murder rate in the world,{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} although the rate has steadily decreased since then to reach only 300 murders in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Termina 2015 con 300 homicidios; disminuye violencia en 23% del 2014|url=http://www.juareznoticias.com/termina-2015-con-300-homicidios-disminuye-violencia-en-23-del-2014/|accessdate=14 January 2015|newspaper=Juarez Noticias|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304081305/http://www.juareznoticias.com/termina-2015-con-300-homicidios-disminuye-violencia-en-23-del-2014/|archivedate=4 March 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Puerto Rico===
{{main|Crime in Puerto Rico}}

Puerto Rico has become a major transshipment point for illegal drugs that are [[Drug smuggling|smuggled]] from source countries like [[Colombia]] and [[Peru]] into the U.S. mainland.  Most of it is transported to and through the island from drug trafficking organizations in the [[Dominican Republic]], Colombia, Florida, and [[criminal organizations]] in Puerto Rico.&lt;ref&gt;[[National Drug Intelligence Center]]. "Puerto Rico and the [[U.S. Virgin Islands]] Drug Threat Assessment." [[U.S. Department of Justice]]. (2003). print.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most common ways drugs are smuggled into the island is through [[Commercial vessel|commercial]] and [[Watercraft|private maritime vessels]], and [[container terminals]] such as the [[Port of San Juan]].  It is the busiest port in the Caribbean and the second busiest in Latin America.

Because drugs are trafficked directly into the island from other source countries, they are less expensive than in any other place in the United States. Thus, it is cheap and easy for street gangs to buy and deal to the public mostly in, and from, housing projects, leading to turf wars and the second highest homicide rate in the United States. Police undermining in the drug trade and corruption are also common. Between 1993 and 2000, 1,000 police officers in Puerto Rico lost their jobs from the department due to criminal charges and between 2003 and 2007, 75 officers were convicted under [[United States district court|federal court]] for police corruption.&lt;ref name="Miami Herald 2007"&gt;"Police corruption undermines Puerto Rican drug war." Miami Herald [Miami, FL] 18 July 2007. General OneFile. Web. 7 June 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Miami Herald 2007"/&gt; 2011 was marked as the most violent year for Puerto Rico with approximately 1,120 murders recorded, 30.5 homicides per 100,000 residents.

===Venezuela===
{{main|Crime in Venezuela}}

Venezuela is among the most violent places in Latin America. Class tension has long been a part of life in the South American country, where armed robberies, carjackings and kidnappings are frequent. Venezuela was ranked the most insecure nation in the world by ''[[Gallup (company)|Gallup]]'' in 2013 with the United Nations stating that such crime is due to the poor political and economic environment in the country.&lt;ref name=GALLUP2014&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sonnenschein|first1=Jan|title=Latin America Scores Lowest on Security|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/175082/latin-america-scores-lowest-security.aspx|website=Gallup|publisher=Gallup|accessdate=22 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ElEspectador&gt;{{cite news|title=Venezuela es el país más inseguro del mundo, según un estudio|url=http://www.elespectador.com/noticias/elmundo/venezuela-el-pais-mas-inseguro-delmundo-segun-un-estud-articulo-511937|accessdate=22 August 2014|agency=El Espectador|date=21 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of the high levels of crime, Venezuelans were forced to change their ways of life due to the large insecurities they continuously experienced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Insecurity has changed the way of life|url=http://eltiempo.com.ve/locales/puertocruz/sociedad/la-inseguridad-ha-cambiado-el-modo-de-vida/136562|accessdate=27 April 2014|newspaper=El Tiempo|date=27 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Crime rates are higher in 'barrios' or 'ranchos' (slum areas) after dark. Petty crime such as pick-pocketing is prevalent, particularly on public transport in Caracas. The government in 2009 created a security force, the [[Bolivarian National Police]], which has supposedly lowered crime rates in the areas in which it is so far deployed according to the Venezuelan government, and a new [[Experimental Security University]] was created.&lt;ref&gt;Simon Romero. "Venezuela more deadly than Iraq". ''New York Times''. August 24, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; However, many statistics have shown an increase of crime even after such measures were taken, with the 2014 murder rate showing an increase to 82 per 100,000, more than quadrupling since 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Venezuela Ranks World's Second In Homicides: Report|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/venezuela-ranks-worlds-second-homicides-report-n276371|accessdate=3 January 2015|agency=NBC News|date=29 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/node/21009630 |accessdate=2010-08-18 |title=Crime in Venezuela: Shooting the messenger | publisher=The Economist |date=2010-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The capital Caracas has one of the greatest homicide rates of any large city in the world, with 122 homicides per 100,000 residents.&lt;ref name="United States Department of State"&gt;{{cite web|title=Venezuela Country Specific Information |url=https://travel.state.gov/travel/cis_pa_tw/cis/cis_1059.html |publisher=United States Department of State |accessdate=10 January 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140111012601/http://travel.state.gov/travel/cis_pa_tw/cis/cis_1059.html |archivedate=11 January 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Venezuela has also ranked high internationally among countries with high kidnapping rates, with consulting firm Control Risk ranking Venezuela 5th in the world for kidnappings in 2013&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Molina|first1=Thabata|title=Ubican a Venezuela en el quinto lugar en riesgo de secuestros|url=http://www.eluniversal.com/sucesos/131214/ubican-a-venezuela-en-el-quinto-lugar-en-riesgo-de-secuestros|accessdate=10 August 2014|agency=El Universal|date=14 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[News.com.au]] calling Venezuela's capital city of Caracas "the kidnap capital of the world" in 2013, noting that Venezuela had the highest kidnapping rate in the world and that 5 people were kidnapped for a [[ransom]] every day.&lt;ref name=NAnov2013&gt;{{cite news|title=Welcome to Venezuela, the kidnap capital of the world|url=http://www.news.com.au/world/south-america/welcome-to-venezuela-the-kidnap-capital-of-the-world/story-fnh81jzo-1226758654049|accessdate=11 December 2014|agency=[[News.com.au]]|date=13 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Foreign governments have also advised tourists of safety concerns while visiting the country. The [[United States State Department]] and [[Government of Canada]] has warned foreign visitors that they may be subjected to [[robbery]], [[kidnapping]] for a [[ransom]] or sale to terrorist organizations and [[murder]], and that their own diplomatic travelers are required to travel in [[Armored car (VIP)|armored vehicles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Venezuela Travel Warning|url=https://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/alertswarnings/venezuela-travel-warning.html|publisher=United States Department of State|accessdate=9 February 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140130073159/http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/alertswarnings/venezuela-travel-warning.html|archive-date=30 January 2014|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Venezuela|url=http://travel.gc.ca/destinations/venezuela|publisher=Government of Canada|accessdate=9 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United Kingdom]]'s [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office]] has advised against all travel to Venezuela.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=FCO travel advice mapped: the world according to Britain's diplomats|url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2011/mar/23/fco-travel-advice-map|newspaper=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''DNA sequencing''' is the process of determining the order of [[nucleotides]] in [[DNA]]. It includes any method or technology that is used to determine the order of the four bases: [[adenine]], [[guanine]], [[cytosine]], and [[thymine]]. The advent of rapid DNA sequencing methods has greatly accelerated biological and medical research and discovery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://theconversation.com/introducing-dark-dna-the-phenomenon-that-could-change-how-we-think-about-evolution-82867|title=Introducing ‘dark DNA’ – the phenomenon that could change how we think about evolution}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Knowledge of DNA sequences has become indispensable for basic biological research, and in numerous applied fields such as [[medical diagnosis]], [[biotechnology]], [[forensic biology]], [[virology]] and biological [[systematics]]. The rapid speed of sequencing attained with modern DNA sequencing technology has been instrumental in the sequencing of complete DNA sequences, or [[genomes]], of numerous types and species of life, including the [[human genome]] and other complete DNA sequences of many animal, plant, and microbial species.
[[File:Radioactive Fluorescent Seq.jpg|thumbnail|An example of the results of automated chain-termination DNA sequencing.]]

The first DNA sequences were obtained in the early 1970s by academic researchers using laborious methods based on [[two-dimensional chromatography]]. Following the development of [[fluorescence]]-based sequencing methods with a [[DNA sequencer]],&lt;ref name=olsvik1993&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Olsvik O, Wahlberg J, Petterson B, Uhlén M, Popovic T, Wachsmuth IK, Fields PI | title = Use of automated sequencing of polymerase chain reaction-generated amplicons to identify three types of cholera toxin subunit B in Vibrio cholerae O1 strains | journal = [[J.

== Applications ==
DNA sequencing may be used to determine the sequence of individual [[gene]]s, larger genetic regions (i.e. clusters of genes or [[operons]]), full chromosomes, or [[Whole genome sequencing|entire genomes]] of any organism.  DNA sequencing is also the most efficient way to indirectly sequence [[RNA]] or [[protein]]s (via their [[open reading frame]]s). In fact, DNA sequencing has become a key technology in many areas of biology and other sciences such as medicine, [[forensics]], and [[anthropology]].

=== Molecular biology ===
Sequencing is used in [[molecular biology]] to study genomes and the proteins they encode. Information obtained using sequencing allows researchers to identify changes in genes, associations with diseases and phenotypes, and identify potential drug targets.

=== Evolutionary biology ===
Since DNA is an informative macromolecule in terms of transmission from one generation to another, DNA sequencing is used in [[evolutionary biology]] to study how different organisms are related and how they evolved.

=== Metagenomics ===
{{Main|Metagenomics}}
The field of [[metagenomics]] involves identification of organisms present in a body of water, [[sewage]], dirt, debris filtered from the air, or swab samples from organisms. Knowing which organisms are present in a particular environment is critical to research in [[ecology]], [[epidemiology]], [[microbiology]], and other fields. Sequencing enables researchers to determine which types of microbes may be present in a [[microbiome]], for example.

=== Medicine ===
Medical technicians may sequence genes (or, theoretically, full genomes) from patients to determine if there is risk of genetic diseases. This is a form of [[genetic testing]], though some genetic tests may not involve DNA sequencing.

=== Forensics ===
DNA sequencing may be used along with [[DNA profiling]] methods for [[forensic identification]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://theconversation.com/from-the-crime-scene-to-the-courtroom-the-journey-of-a-dna-sample-82250|title=From the crime scene to the courtroom: the journey of a DNA sample|last=Curtis|first=Caitlin|date=29 August 2017|work=The Conversation|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|last2=Hereward|first2=James}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[DNA paternity testing|paternity testing]]. DNA testing has evolved tremendously in the last few decades to ultimately link a DNA print to what is under investigation. The DNA patterns in fingerprint, saliva, hair follicles, etc. uniquely separate each living organism from another. Testing DNA is a technique which can detect specific genomes in a DNA strand to produce a unique and individualized pattern. Every living organism ever created has a one of a kind DNA pattern, which can be determined through DNA testing. It is extremely rare that two people have exactly the same DNA pattern, therefore DNA testing is highly successful.

== The four canonical bases ==
{{Main|Nucleotide}}
The canonical structure of DNA has four bases: [[thymine]] (T), [[adenine]] (A), [[cytosine]] (C), and [[guanine]] (G). DNA sequencing is the determination of the physical order of these bases in a molecule of DNA. However, there are many other bases that may be present in a molecule. In some viruses (specifically, [[bacteriophage]]), cytosine may be replaced by hydroxy methyl or hydroxy methyl glucose cytosine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Moréra|first1=Solange|last2=Larivière|first2=Laurent|last3=Kurzeck|first3=Jürgen|last4=Aschke-Sonnenborn|first4=Ursula|last5=Freemont|first5=Paul S|last6=Janin|first6=Joël|last7=Rüger|first7=Wolfgang|title=High resolution crystal structures of T4 phage β-glucosyltransferase: induced fit and effect of substrate and metal binding|journal=Journal of Molecular Biology|date=August 2001|volume=311|issue=3|pages=569–77|doi=10.1006/jmbi.2001.4905|pmid=11493010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In mammalian DNA, variant bases with [[methyl]] groups or phosphosulfate may be found.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ehrlich|first1=Melanie|last2=Gama-Sosa|first2=Miguel A.|last3=Huang|first3=Lan-Hsiang|last4=Midgett|first4=Rose Marie|last5=Kuo|first5=Kenneth C.|last6=McCune|first6=Roy A.|last7=Gehrke|first7=Charles|title=Amount and distribution of 5-methylcytosine in human DNA from different types of tissues or cells|journal=Nucleic Acids Research|date=1982|volume=10|issue=8|pages=2709–21|doi=10.1093/nar/10.8.2709|pmid=7079182|pmc=320645}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ehrlich|first1=M|last2=Wang|first2=R.|title=5-Methylcytosine in eukaryotic DNA|journal=Science|date=19 June 1981|volume=212|issue=4501|pages=1350–57|doi=10.1126/science.6262918|pmid=6262918|bibcode = 1981Sci...212.1350E }}&lt;/ref&gt; Depending on the sequencing technique, a particular modification, e.g., the 5mC ([[5 methyl cytosine]]) common in humans, may or may not be detected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Song|first1=Chun-Xiao|last2=Clark|first2=Tyson A|last3=Lu|first3=Xing-Yu|last4=Kislyuk|first4=Andrey|last5=Dai|first5=Qing|last6=Turner|first6=Stephen W|last7=He|first7=Chuan|last8=Korlach|first8=Jonas|title=Sensitive and specific single-molecule sequencing of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine|journal=Nature Methods|date=20 November 2011|volume=9|issue=1|pages=75–77|doi=10.1038/nmeth.1779|pmid=22101853|pmc=3646335}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
=== Discovery of DNA structure and function ===
Deoxyribonucleic acid ([[DNA]]) was first discovered and isolated by [[Friedrich Miescher]] in 1869, but it remained understudied for many decades because proteins, rather than DNA, were thought to hold the genetic blueprint to life. This situation changed after 1944 as a result of some experiments by [[Oswald Avery]], [[Colin Munro MacLeod|Colin MacLeod]], and [[Maclyn McCarty]] demonstrating that purified DNA could change one strain of bacteria into another. This was the first time that DNA was shown capable of transforming the properties of cells.

In 1953, [[James Watson]] and [[Francis Crick]] put forward their [[double-helix]] model of DNA, based on [[X-ray crystallography|crystallized X-ray]] structures being studied by [[Rosalind Franklin]] – and without crediting her. According to the model, DNA is composed of two strands of nucleotides coiled around each other, linked together by hydrogen bonds and running in opposite directions. Each strand is composed of four complementary nucleotides – adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G) and thymine (T) – with an A on one strand always paired with T on the other, and C always paired with G. They proposed such a structure allowed each strand to be used to reconstruct the other, an idea central to the passing on of hereditary information between generations.&lt;ref name="pmid13168976"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Watson JD, Crick FH | title = The structure of DNA | journal = Cold Spring Harb. Symp. Quant. Biol. | volume = 18 | issue =  | pages = 123–31 | year = 1953 | pmid = 13168976 | doi = 10.1101/SQB.1953.018.01.020 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Frederick Sanger2.jpg|thumb|[[Frederick Sanger]], a pioneer of sequencing. Sanger is one of the few scientists who was awarded two Nobel prizes, one for the [[Protein sequencing|sequencing of proteins]], and the other for the sequencing of DNA.]]
The foundation for sequencing proteins was first laid by the work of [[Frederick Sanger]] who by 1955 had completed the sequence of all the amino acids in [[insulin]], a small protein secreted by the pancreas. This provided the first conclusive evidence that proteins were chemical entities with a specific molecular pattern rather than a random mixture of material suspended in fluid. Sanger's success in sequencing insulin greatly electrified x-ray crystallographers, including Watson and Crick who by now were trying to understand how DNA directed the formation of proteins within a cell. Soon after attending a series of lectures given by Frederick Sanger in October 1954, Crick began to develop a theory which argued that the arrangement of nucleotides in DNA determined the sequence of amino acids in proteins which in turn helped determine the function of a protein. He published this theory in 1958.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.whatisbiotechnology.org/exhibitions/sanger/path Marks, L, The path to DNA sequencing: The life and work of Frederick Sanger].&lt;/ref&gt;

===RNA sequencing===
[[RNA sequencing]] was one of the earliest forms of nucleotide sequencing. The major landmark of RNA sequencing is the sequence of the first complete gene and the complete genome of [[Bacteriophage MS2]], identified and published by [[Walter Fiers]] and his coworkers at the [[University of Ghent]] ([[Ghent]], [[Belgium]]), in 1972&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Min Jou W, Haegeman G, Ysebaert M, Fiers W | title = Nucleotide sequence of the gene coding for the bacteriophage MS2 coat protein | journal = Nature | volume = 237 | issue = 5350 | pages = 82–8 | date = May 1972 | pmid = 4555447 | doi = 10.1038/237082a0 | bibcode = 1972Natur.237...82J }}&lt;/ref&gt; and 1976.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fiers W, Contreras R, Duerinck F, Haegeman G, Iserentant D, Merregaert J, Min Jou W, Molemans F, Raeymaekers A, Van den Berghe A, Volckaert G, Ysebaert M | title = Complete nucleotide sequence of bacteriophage MS2 RNA: primary and secondary structure of the replicase gene | journal = Nature | volume = 260 | issue = 5551 | pages = 500–7 | date = April 1976 | pmid = 1264203 | doi = 10.1038/260500a0 | bibcode = 1976Natur.260..500F }}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditional RNA sequencing methods require the creation of a [[Complementary DNA|cDNA]] molecule which must be sequenced.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ozsolak|first=Fatih|last2=Milos|first2=Patrice M.|date=2011-02-01|title=RNA sequencing: advances, challenges and opportunities|url=http://www.nature.com/nrg/journal/v12/n2/full/nrg2934.html|journal=Nature Reviews Genetics|language=en|volume=12|issue=2|pages=87–98|doi=10.1038/nrg2934|issn=1471-0056|pmc=3031867|pmid=21191423}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early DNA sequencing methods===
The first method for determining DNA sequences involved a location-specific primer extension strategy established by [[Ray Wu]] at [[Cornell University]] in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mbg.cornell.edu/faculty-staff/faculty/wu.cfm|title=Ray Wu Faculty Profile|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090304121126/http://www.mbg.cornell.edu/faculty-staff/faculty/wu.cfm|archivedate=2009-03-04|publisher=Cornell University}}&lt;/ref&gt; DNA polymerase catalysis and specific nucleotide labeling, both of which figure prominently in current sequencing schemes, were used to sequence the cohesive ends of lambda phage DNA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Padmanabhan|first=R|author2=Ray Wu |author3=Ernest Jay |title=Chemical Synthesis of a Primer and Its Use in the Sequence Analysis of the Lysozyme Gene of Bacteriophage T4|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|date=June 1974|volume=71|issue=6|pages=2510–14|doi=10.1073/pnas.71.6.2510|bibcode=1974PNAS...71.2510P|pmc=388489}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Onaga LA | title = Ray Wu as Fifth Business: Demonstrating Collective Memory in the History of DNA Sequencing | journal = Studies in the History and Philosophy of Science | volume = 46 | pages = 1–14 | date = June 2014 | pmid = 24565976 | doi = 10.1016/j.shpsc.2013.12.006 | series = Part C }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid4553110"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wu R | title = Nucleotide sequence analysis of DNA | journal = Nature New Biology | volume = 236 | issue = 68 | pages = 198–200 | year = 1972 | pmid = 4553110 | doi = 10.1038/newbio236198a0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Between 1970 and 1973, Wu, R Padmanabhan and colleagues demonstrated that this method can be employed to determine any DNA sequence using synthetic location-specific primers.&lt;ref name="pmid4560009"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Padmanabhan R, Wu R | title = Nucleotide sequence analysis of DNA.

=== Sequencing of full genomes ===
[[File:Genome map of the bacteriophage ΦX174 showing overlapping genes.svg|thumb|300px|Right|The 5,386 bp genome of [[bacteriophage φX174]]. Each coloured block represents a gene.]]

By 1990, the U.S. [[National Institutes of Health]] (NIH) had begun large-scale sequencing trials on ''[[Mycoplasma capricolum]]'', ''[[Escherichia coli]]'', ''[[Caenorhabditis elegans]]'', and ''[[Saccharomyces cerevisiae]]'' at a cost of US$0.75 per base.

By 2001, shotgun sequencing methods had been used to produce a draft sequence of the human genome.&lt;ref name="Lander_2001"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Venter_2001"/&gt;

=== High-throughput sequencing (HTS) methods ===
Several new methods for DNA sequencing were developed in the mid to late 1990s and were implemented in commercial [[DNA sequencers]] by the year 2000. Together these were called the "next-generation" or "second-generation" sequencing (NGS) methods, in order to distinguish them from the aforementioned earlier methods, like Sanger Sequencing. In contrast to the first generation of sequencing, NGS technology is typically characterized by being highly scalable, allowing the entire genome to be sequenced at once. Usually, this is accomplished by fragmenting the genome into small pieces, randomly sampling for a fragment, and sequencing it using one of a variety of technologies, such as those described below. An entire genome is possible because multiple fragments are sequenced at once (giving it the name "massively parallel" sequencing) in an automated process.

NGS technology has tremendously empowered researchers to look for insights into health, anthropologists to investigate human origins, and is catalyzing the "[[Personalized medicine|Personalized Medicine]]" movement. However, it has also opened the door to more room for error. There are many software tools to carry out the computational analysis of NGS data, each with its own algorithm. Even the parameters within one software package can change the outcome of the analysis. In addition, the large quantities of data produced by DNA sequencing have also required development of new methods and programs for sequence analysis. Several efforts to develop standards in the NGS field have been attempted to address these challenges, most of which have been small-scale efforts arising from individual labs. Most recently, a large, organized, FDA-funded effort has culminated in the [[BioCompute Object|BioCompute]] standard.

On 26 October 1990, [[Roger Tsien]], Pepi Ross, Margaret Fahnestock and Allan J Johnston filed a patent describing stepwise ("base-by-base") sequencing with removable 3' blockers on DNA arrays (blots and single DNA molecules).&lt;ref name=TsienPatent&gt;{{cite web|url=http://worldwide.espacenet.com/publicationDetails/biblio?FT=D&amp;date=19910516&amp;DB=EPODOC&amp;locale=en_EP&amp;CC=WO&amp;NR=9106678A1&amp;KC=A1&amp;ND=4|title=Espacenet – Bibliographic data|website=worldwide.espacenet.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1996, [[Pål Nyrén]] and his student [[Mostafa Ronaghi]] at the Royal Institute of Technology in [[Stockholm]] published their method of [[pyrosequencing]].&lt;ref name=Ronaghi&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ronaghi M, Karamohamed S, Pettersson B, Uhlén M, Nyrén P | title = Real-time DNA sequencing using detection of pyrophosphate release | journal = Analytical Biochemistry | volume = 242 | issue = 1 | pages = 84–89 | year = 1996 | pmid = 8923969 | doi = 10.1006/abio.1996.0432 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 April 1997, Pascal Mayer and Laurent Farinelli submitted patents to the World Intellectual Property Organization describing DNA colony sequencing.&lt;ref name=DNA_colony_patents&gt;{{cite web| last = Kawashima | first = Eric H. | author2 = Laurent Farinelli | author3 = Pascal Mayer | title = Patent: Method of nucleic acid amplification | accessdate = 2012-12-22 | date = 2005-05-12 | url = http://www.patentlens.net/patentlens/patent/WO_1998_044151_A1/en/

Lynx Therapeutics published and marketed [[Massively parallel signature sequencing]] (MPSS), in 2000. This method incorporated a parallelized, adapter/ligation-mediated, bead-based sequencing technology and served as the first commercially available "next-generation" sequencing method, though no [[DNA sequencers]] were sold to independent laboratories.&lt;ref name="Brenner_2000"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Brenner S, Johnson M, Bridgham J, Golda G, Lloyd DH, Johnson D, Luo S, McCurdy S, Foy M, Ewan M, Roth R, George D, Eletr S, Albrecht G, Vermaas E, Williams SR, Moon K, Burcham T, Pallas M, DuBridge RB, Kirchner J, Fearon K, Mao J, Corcoran K | title = Gene expression analysis by massively parallel signature sequencing (MPSS) on microbead arrays | journal = Nature Biotechnology | volume = 18 | issue = 6 | pages = 630–34 | year = 2000 | pmid = 10835600 | doi = 10.1038/76469 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Basic methods ==

=== Maxam-Gilbert sequencing ===
{{Main|Maxam-Gilbert sequencing}}
[[Allan Maxam]] and [[Walter Gilbert]] published a DNA sequencing method in 1977 based on chemical modification of DNA and subsequent cleavage at specific bases.&lt;ref name=Maxam77&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Maxam AM, Gilbert W | title = A new method for sequencing DNA | journal = Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA | volume = 74 | issue = 2 | pages = 560–64 | date = February 1977 | pmid = 265521 | pmc = 392330 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.74.2.560 | bibcode = 1977PNAS...74..560M }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Also known as chemical sequencing, this method allowed purified samples of double-stranded DNA to be used without further cloning.  This method's use of radioactive labeling and its technical complexity discouraged extensive use after refinements in the Sanger methods had been made.

Maxam-Gilbert sequencing requires radioactive labeling at one 5' end of the DNA and purification of the DNA fragment to be sequenced. Chemical treatment then generates breaks at a small proportion of one or two of the four nucleotide bases in each of four reactions (G, A+G, C, C+T). The concentration of the modifying chemicals is controlled to introduce on average one modification per DNA molecule. Thus a series of labeled fragments is generated, from the radiolabeled end to the first "cut" site in each molecule. The fragments in the four reactions are electrophoresed side by side in denaturing acrylamide gels for size separation. To visualize the fragments, the gel is exposed to X-ray film for autoradiography, yielding a series of dark bands each corresponding to a radiolabeled DNA fragment, from which the sequence may be inferred.&lt;ref name=Maxam77 /&gt;

=== Chain-termination methods ===
{{Main|Sanger sequencing}}
The [[Sanger sequencing|chain-termination method]] developed by [[Frederick Sanger]] and coworkers in 1977 soon became the method of choice, owing to its relative ease and reliability.&lt;ref name="Sanger1977"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sanger F, Nicklen S, Coulson AR | title = DNA sequencing with chain-terminating inhibitors | journal = Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA | volume = 74 | issue = 12 | pages = 5463–77 | date = December 1977 | pmid = 271968 | pmc = 431765 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.74.12.5463 | bibcode = 1977PNAS...74.5463S }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Sanger75&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sanger F, Coulson AR | title = A rapid method for determining sequences in DNA by primed synthesis with DNA polymerase | journal = J. Mol. Biol. | volume = 94 | issue = 3 | pages = 441–48 | date = May 1975 | pmid = 1100841 | doi = 10.1016/0022-2836(75)90213-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When invented, the chain-terminator method used fewer toxic chemicals and lower amounts of radioactivity than the Maxam and Gilbert method.  Because of its comparative ease, the Sanger method was soon automated and was the method used in the first generation of [[DNA sequencer]]s.

Sanger sequencing is the method which prevailed from the 1980s until the mid-2000s. Over that period, great advances were made in the technique, such as fluorescent labelling, capillary electrophoresis, and general automation. These developments allowed much more efficient sequencing, leading to lower costs. The Sanger method, in mass production form, is the technology which produced the [[Human Genome Project|first human genome]] in 2001, ushering in the age of [[genomics]]. However, later in the decade, radically different approaches reached the market, bringing the cost per genome down from $100 million in 2001 to $10,000 in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Wetterstrand |first=Kris |title=DNA Sequencing Costs: Data from the NHGRI Genome Sequencing Program (GSP) |publisher=[[National Human Genome Research Institute]] |accessdate=30 May 2013 |url=https://www.genome.gov/sequencingcosts }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Advanced methods and ''de novo'' sequencing ==
[[File:DNA Sequencing gDNA libraries.jpg|thumb|right|Genomic DNA is fragmented into random pieces and cloned as a bacterial library. DNA from individual bacterial clones is sequenced and the sequence is assembled by using overlapping DNA regions.(click to expand)]] Large-scale sequencing often aims at sequencing very long DNA pieces, such as whole [[chromosome]]s, although large-scale sequencing can also be used to generate very large numbers of short sequences, such as found in [[phage display]]. For longer targets such as chromosomes, common approaches consist of cutting (with [[restriction enzyme]]s) or shearing (with mechanical forces) large DNA fragments into shorter DNA fragments. The fragmented DNA may then be [[clone (genetics)|cloned]] into a [[Vector DNA|DNA vector]] and amplified in a bacterial host such as ''[[Escherichia coli]]''. Short DNA fragments purified from individual bacterial colonies are individually sequenced and [[sequence assembly|assembled electronically]] into one long, contiguous sequence. Studies have shown that adding a size selection step to collect DNA fragments of uniform size can improve sequencing efficiency and accuracy of the genome assembly. In these studies, automated sizing has proven to be more reproducible and precise than manual gel sizing.&lt;ref name="pmid23147856"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Quail MA, Gu Y, Swerdlow H, Mayho M | title = Evaluation and optimisation of preparative semi-automated electrophoresis systems for Illumina library preparation | journal = Electrophoresis | volume = 33 | issue = 23 | pages = 3521–28 | year = 2012 | pmid = 23147856 | doi = 10.1002/elps.201200128 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid22713159"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Duhaime MB, Deng L, Poulos BT, Sullivan MB | title = Towards quantitative metagenomics of wild viruses and other ultra-low concentration DNA samples: a rigorous assessment and optimization of the linker amplification method | journal = Environ.

The term "''de novo'' sequencing" specifically refers to methods used to determine the sequence of DNA with no previously known sequence. ''De novo'' translates from Latin as "from the beginning". Gaps in the assembled sequence may be filled by [[primer walking]]. The different strategies have different tradeoffs in speed and accuracy; [[shotgun sequencing|shotgun methods]] are often used for sequencing large genomes, but its assembly is complex and difficult, particularly with [[Microsatellite (genetics)|sequence repeat]]s often causing gaps in genome assembly.

Most sequencing approaches use an ''in vitro'' cloning step to amplify individual DNA molecules, because their molecular detection methods are not sensitive enough for single molecule sequencing. Emulsion PCR&lt;ref name=Williams2006ePCR&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Williams R, Peisajovich SG, Miller OJ, Magdassi S, Tawfik DS, Griffiths AD | title = Amplification of complex gene libraries by emulsion PCR | journal = Nature Methods | volume = 3 | issue = 7 | pages = 545–50 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16791213 | doi = 10.1038/nmeth896 }}&lt;/ref&gt; isolates individual DNA molecules along with primer-coated beads in aqueous droplets within an oil phase. A [[polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR) then coats each bead with clonal copies of the DNA molecule followed by immobilization for later sequencing. Emulsion PCR is used in the methods developed by Marguilis et al. (commercialized by [[454 Life Sciences]]), Shendure and Porreca et al.

=== Shotgun sequencing ===
{{Main|Shotgun sequencing}}
Shotgun sequencing is a sequencing method designed for analysis of DNA sequences longer than 1000 base pairs, up to and including entire chromosomes.  This method requires the target DNA to be broken into random fragments.  After sequencing individual fragments, the sequences can be reassembled on the basis of their overlapping regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Staden R | title = A strategy of DNA sequencing employing computer programs. | journal = Nucleic Acids Research | volume = 6 | issue = 7 | pages = 2601–10 | date = 11 Jun 1979 | pmid = 461197 | pmc = 327874 | doi = 10.1093/nar/6.7.2601 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bridge PCR ===
Another method for ''[[in vitro]]'' clonal amplification is bridge PCR, in which fragments are amplified upon primers attached to a solid surface&lt;ref name=DNA_colony_patents /&gt;&lt;ref name=DNA_colony_presentation&gt;P. Mayer,L. Farinelli, G. Matton, C. Adessi, G. Turcatti, J. J. Mermod, E.

This method is used in the [[Illumina (company)|Illumina]] Genome Analyzer [[#subsection Illumina (Solexa) sequencing|sequencers]]. Single-molecule methods, such as that developed by [[Stephen Quake]]'s laboratory (later commercialized by [[Helicos Biosciences|Helicos]]) are an exception:  they use bright fluorophores and laser excitation to detect base addition events from individual DNA molecules fixed to a surface, eliminating the need for molecular amplification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Braslavsky I, Hebert B, Kartalov E, Quake SR | title = Sequence information can be obtained from single DNA molecules | journal = Proc.

High-throughput (formerly "next-generation") sequencing applies to genome sequencing, genome resequencing, [[transcriptome]] profiling ([[RNA-Seq]]), DNA-protein interactions ([[ChIP-sequencing]]), and [[epigenome]] characterization.&lt;ref name="pmid19900591"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = de Magalhães JP, Finch CE, Janssens G | title = Next-generation sequencing in aging research: emerging applications, problems, pitfalls and possible solutions | journal = [[Ageing Research Reviews]] | volume = 9 | issue = 3 | pages = 315–23 | year = 2010 | pmid = 19900591 | pmc = 2878865 | doi = 10.1016/j.arr.2009.10.006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Resequencing is necessary, because the genome of a single individual of a species will not indicate all of the genome variations among other individuals of the same species.

=== Massively parallel signature sequencing (MPSS) ===
The first of the high-throughput sequencing technologies, [[massively parallel signature sequencing]] (or MPSS), was developed in the 1990s at Lynx Therapeutics, a company founded in 1992 by [[Sydney Brenner]] and [[Applied Biosystems#History|Sam Eletr]]. MPSS was a bead-based method that used a complex approach of adapter ligation followed by adapter decoding, reading the sequence in increments of four nucleotides. This method made it susceptible to sequence-specific bias or loss of specific sequences. Because the technology was so complex, MPSS was only performed 'in-house' by Lynx Therapeutics and no DNA sequencing machines were sold to independent laboratories. Lynx Therapeutics merged with Solexa (later acquired by [[Illumina (company)|Illumina]]) in 2004, leading to the development of sequencing-by-synthesis, a simpler approach acquired from [[Manteia Predictive Medicine]], which rendered MPSS obsolete. However, the essential properties of the MPSS output were typical of later high-throughput data types, including hundreds of thousands of short DNA sequences. In the case of MPSS, these were typically used for sequencing [[cDNA]] for measurements of [[gene expression]] levels.&lt;ref name="Brenner_2000"/&gt;

=== Polony sequencing ===
{{Main|Polony sequencing}}
The [[Polony sequencing]] method, developed in the laboratory of [[George M. Church]] at Harvard, was among the first high-throughput sequencing systems and was used to sequence a full ''[[E. coli]]'' genome in 2005.&lt;ref name=Shendure2005&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Shendure J, Porreca GJ, Reppas NB, Lin X, McCutcheon JP, Rosenbaum AM, Wang MD, Zhang K, Mitra RD, Church GM | title = Accurate multiplex polony sequencing of an evolved bacterial genome. | journal = Science | volume = 309 | issue = 5741 | pages = 1728–32 | date = 9 Sep 2005 | pmid = 16081699 | doi = 10.1126/science.1117389 | bibcode = 2005Sci...309.1728S }}&lt;/ref&gt; It combined an in vitro paired-tag library with emulsion PCR, an automated microscope, and ligation-based sequencing chemistry to sequence an ''E. coli'' genome at an accuracy of &gt;99.9999% and a cost approximately 1/9 that of Sanger sequencing.&lt;ref name=Shendure2005 /&gt; The technology was licensed to Agencourt Biosciences, subsequently spun out into Agencourt Personal Genomics, and eventually incorporated into the [[Applied Biosystems]] SOLiD platform. Applied Biosystems was later acquired by [[Life Technologies (Thermo Fisher Scientific)|Life Technologies]], now part of [[Thermo Fisher Scientific]].

=== 454 pyrosequencing ===
{{Main|454 Life Sciences#Technology}}
A parallelized version of [[pyrosequencing]] was developed by [[454 Life Sciences]], which has since been acquired by [[Roche Diagnostics]]. The method amplifies DNA inside water droplets in an oil solution (emulsion PCR), with each droplet containing a single DNA template attached to a single primer-coated bead that then forms a clonal colony. The sequencing machine contains many [[picoliter]]-volume wells each containing a single bead and sequencing enzymes. Pyrosequencing uses [[luciferase]] to generate light for detection of the individual nucleotides added to the nascent DNA, and the combined data are used to generate sequence [[read (biology)|reads]].&lt;ref name="Margulies_2005"/&gt; This technology provides intermediate read length and price per base compared to Sanger sequencing on one end and Solexa and SOLiD on the other.&lt;ref name="pmid18165802"/&gt;

=== Illumina (Solexa) sequencing ===
{{Main|Illumina dye sequencing}}
[[Solexa]], now part of [[Illumina (company)|Illumina]], was founded by [[Shankar Balasubramanian]] and [[David Klenerman]] in 1998, and developed a sequencing method based on reversible dye-terminators technology, and engineered polymerases.&lt;ref name = "Bentley_2008"/&gt; The reversible terminated chemistry concept was invented by Bruno Canard and Simon Sarfati at the Pasteur Institute in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Canard|first=Bruno|title=Novel derivatives usable for the sequencing of nucleic acids|date=13 Oct 1994|url=http://www.google.ge/patents/CA2158975A1|last2=Sarfati|first2=Simon|accessdate=2016-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Canard|first=Bruno|last2=Sarfati|first2=Robert S.|date=1994-10-11|title=DNA polymerase fluorescent substrates with reversible 3′-tags|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0378111994902267|journal=Gene|volume=148|issue=1|pages=1–6|doi=10.1016/0378-1119(94)90226-7|pmid=7523248}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was developed internally at Solexa by those named on the relevant patents. In 2004, Solexa acquired the company [[Manteia Predictive Medicine]] in order to gain a massively parallel sequencing technology invented in 1997 by Pascal Mayer and Laurent Farinelli.&lt;ref name=DNA_colony_patents /&gt; It is based on "DNA Clusters" or "DNA colonies", which involves the clonal amplification of DNA on a surface. The cluster technology was co-acquired with Lynx Therapeutics of California. Solexa Ltd. later merged with Lynx to form Solexa Inc.

[[File:Illumina HiSeq 2500.jpg|thumb|An Illumina HiSeq 2500 sequencer]]

In this method, DNA molecules and primers are first attached on a slide or flow cell and amplified with [[polymerase]] so that local clonal DNA colonies, later coined "DNA clusters", are formed. To determine the sequence, four types of reversible terminator bases (RT-bases) are added and non-incorporated nucleotides are washed away. A camera takes images of the [[Fluorescent labeling|fluorescently labeled]] nucleotides. Then the dye, along with the terminal 3' blocker, is chemically removed from the DNA, allowing for the next cycle to begin. Unlike pyrosequencing, the DNA chains are extended one nucleotide at a time and image acquisition can be performed at a delayed moment, allowing for very large arrays of DNA colonies to be captured by sequential images taken from a single camera.

[[File:Illumina MiSeq sequencer.jpg|thumb|An Illumina MiSeq sequencer]]

Decoupling the enzymatic reaction and the image capture allows for optimal throughput and theoretically unlimited sequencing capacity.  With an optimal configuration, the ultimately reachable instrument throughput is thus dictated solely by the analog-to-digital conversion rate of the camera, multiplied by the number of cameras and divided by the number of pixels per DNA colony required for visualizing them optimally (approximately 10 pixels/colony). In 2012, with cameras operating at more than 10&amp;nbsp;MHz A/D conversion rates and available optics, fluidics and enzymatics, throughput can be multiples of 1 million nucleotides/second, corresponding roughly to 1 human genome equivalent at 1x [[Coverage (genetics)|coverage]] per hour per instrument, and 1 human genome re-sequenced (at approx. 30x) per day per instrument (equipped with a single camera).&lt;ref name="pmid18576944"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mardis ER | title = Next-generation DNA sequencing methods | journal = Annu Rev Genom Hum Genet | volume = 9 | issue =  | pages = 387–402 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18576944 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.genom.9.081307.164359 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, data are now generated as contiguous full-length reads in the standard FASTQ file format and can be used as-is in most short-read-based bioinformatics analysis pipelines.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Huang|first=Jie|last2=Liang|first2=Xinming|last3=Xuan|first3=Yuankai|last4=Geng|first4=Chunyu|last5=Li|first5=Yuxiang|last6=Lu|first6=Haorong|last7=Qu|first7=Shoufang|last8=Mei|first8=Xianglin|last9=Chen|first9=Hongbo|date=2017-05-01|title=A reference human genome dataset of the BGISEQ-500 sequencer|url=https://academic.oup.com/gigascience/article/6/5/1/3098240|journal=GigaScience|language=en|volume=6|issue=5|pages=1–9|doi=10.1093/gigascience/gix024|pmc=5467036|pmid=28379488}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

The two technologies that form the basis for this high-throughput sequencing technology are [[DNA nanoball sequencing|DNA nanoballs]] (DNB) and patterned arrays for nanoball attachment to a solid surface.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; DNA nanoballs are simply formed by denaturing double stranded, adapter ligated libraries and ligating the forward strand only to a splint oligonucleotide to form a ssDNA circle. Faithful copies of the circles containing the DNA insert are produced utilizing Rolling Circle Amplification that generates approximately 300–500 copies. The long strand of ssDNA folds upon itself to produce a three-dimensional nanoball structure that is approximately 220 nm in diameter. Making DNBs replaces the need to generate PCR copies of the library on the flow cell and as such can remove large proportions of duplicate reads, adapter-adapter ligations and PCR induced errors.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}
[[File:MGISEQ-2000RS.jpg|thumb|A BGI MGISEQ-2000RS sequencer]]
The patterned array of positively charged spots is fabricated through photolithography and etching techniques followed by chemical modification to generate a sequencing flow cell.  Each spot on the flow cell is approximately 250 nm in diameter, are separated by 700 nm  (centre to centre) and allows easy attachment of a single negatively charged DNB to the flow cell and thus reducing under or over-clustering on the flow cell.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

Sequencing is then performed by addition of an oligonucleotide probe that attaches in combination to specific sites within the DNB. The probe acts as an anchor that then allows one of four single reversibly inactivated, labelled nucleotides to bind after flowing across the flow cell. Unbound nucleotides are washed away before laser excitation of the attached labels then emit fluorescence and signal is captured by cameras that is converted to a digital output for base calling. The attached base has its terminator and label chemically cleaved at completion of the cycle. The cycle is repeated with another flow of free, labelled nucleotides across the flow cell to allow the next nucleotide to bind and have its signal captured. This process is completed a number of times (usually 50 to 300 times) to determine the sequence of the inserted piece of DNA at a rate of approximately 40 million nucleotides per second as of 2018.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

=== SOLiD sequencing ===
[[File:Library preparation for the SOLiD platform.svg|right|thumb|Library preparation for the SOLiD platform]]
{{Main|2 base encoding}}
[[Applied Biosystems]]' (now a [[Life Technologies (Thermo Fisher Scientific)|Life Technologies]] brand) SOLiD technology employs [[sequencing by ligation]]. Here, a pool of all possible oligonucleotides of a fixed length are labeled according to the sequenced position. Oligonucleotides are annealed and ligated; the preferential ligation by [[DNA ligase]] for matching sequences results in a signal informative of the nucleotide at that position. Before sequencing, the DNA is amplified by emulsion PCR. The resulting beads, each containing single copies of the same DNA molecule, are deposited on a glass slide.&lt;ref name="pmid18477713"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Valouev A, Ichikawa J, Tonthat T, Stuart J, Ranade S, Peckham H, Zeng K, Malek JA, Costa G, McKernan K, Sidow A, Fire A, Johnson SM | title = A high-resolution, nucleosome position map of C. elegans reveals a lack of universal sequence-dictated positioning | journal = Genome Res. | volume = 18 | issue = 7 | pages = 1051–63 | date = July 2008 | pmid = 18477713 | pmc = 2493394 | doi = 10.1101/gr.076463.108 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The result is sequences of quantities and lengths comparable to Illumina sequencing.&lt;ref name="pmid18165802"/&gt; This [[sequencing by ligation]] method has been reported to have some issue sequencing palindromic sequences.&lt;ref name="Yu-Feng Huang, Sheng-Chung Chen, Yih-Shien Chiang, Tzu-Han Chen &amp; Kuo-Ping Chiu 2012 S10"/&gt;

=== Ion Torrent semiconductor sequencing ===
{{Main|Ion semiconductor sequencing}}
Ion Torrent Systems Inc. (now owned by [[Life Technologies (Thermo Fisher Scientific)|Life Technologies]]) developed a system based on using standard sequencing chemistry, but with a novel, semiconductor-based detection system. This method of sequencing is based on the detection of [[hydrogen ion]]s that are released during the [[DNA polymerase|polymerisation]] of [[DNA]], as opposed to the optical methods used in other sequencing systems. A microwell containing a template DNA strand to be sequenced is flooded with a single type of [[nucleotide]]. If the introduced nucleotide is [[complementarity (molecular biology)|complementary]] to the leading template nucleotide it is incorporated into the growing complementary strand. This causes the release of a hydrogen ion that triggers a hypersensitive ion sensor, which indicates that a reaction has occurred. If [[homopolymer]] repeats are present in the template sequence, multiple nucleotides will be incorporated in a single cycle. This leads to a corresponding number of released hydrogens and a proportionally higher electronic signal.&lt;ref name="rusk"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rusk N | year = 2011 | title = Torrents of sequence | url = | journal = Nat Methods | volume = 8 | issue = 1| page = 44 | doi=10.1038/nmeth.f.330}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== DNA nanoball sequencing ===
{{Main|DNA nanoball sequencing}}
[[DNA nanoball sequencing]] is a type of high throughput sequencing technology used to determine the entire [[genomic sequence]] of an organism.  The company [[Complete Genomics]] uses this technology to sequence samples submitted by independent researchers.  The method uses [[rolling circle replication]] to amplify small fragments of genomic DNA into DNA nanoballs.  Unchained sequencing by ligation is then used to determine the nucleotide sequence.&lt;ref name = "Drmanac_2010" /&gt;  This method of DNA sequencing allows large numbers of DNA nanoballs to be sequenced per run and at low [[reagent]] costs compared to other high-throughput sequencing platforms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Porreca GJ | title = Genome Sequencing on Nanoballs | journal = Nature Biotechnology | volume = 28 | issue = 1 | pages = 43–44 | year = 2010 | pmid = 20062041 | doi = 10.1038/nbt0110-43 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, only short sequences of DNA are determined from each DNA nanoball which makes mapping the short reads to a [[reference genome]] difficult.&lt;ref name = "Drmanac_2010"/&gt; This technology has been used for multiple genome sequencing projects and is scheduled to be used for more.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100825003320/http://www.completegenomics.com/news-events/press-releases/ Complete Genomics] Press release, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Heliscope single molecule sequencing ===
{{Main|Helicos single molecule fluorescent sequencing}}
Heliscope sequencing is a method of single-molecule sequencing developed by [[Helicos Biosciences]]. It uses DNA fragments with added poly-A tail adapters which are attached to the flow cell surface. The next steps involve extension-based sequencing with cyclic washes of the flow cell with fluorescently labeled nucleotides (one nucleotide type at a time, as with the Sanger method). The reads are performed by the Heliscope sequencer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.helicosbio.com/Products/HelicosregGeneticAnalysisSystem/HeliScopetradeSequencer/tabid/87/Default.aspx|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091102041828/http://www.helicosbio.com/Products/HelicosregGeneticAnalysisSystem/HeliScopetradeSequencer/tabid/87/Default.aspx|archivedate=2009-11-02|title=HeliScope Gene Sequencing / Genetic Analyzer System : Helicos BioSciences|date=2 November 2009|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Thompson JF, Steinmann KE | title = Single molecule sequencing with a HeliScope genetic analysis system | journal = Current Protocols in Molecular Biology | volume = Chapter 7 | pages = Unit7.10 | date = October 2010 | pmid = 20890904 | pmc = 2954431 | doi = 10.1002/0471142727.mb0710s92 | isbn = 978-0471142720 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The reads are short, averaging 35 bp.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://seqll.com/technical-description/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140808055229/http://seqll.com/technical-description/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=8 August 2014 |publisher=SeqLL |accessdate=9 Aug 2015 |title=tSMS SeqLL Technical Explanation}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009 a human genome was sequenced using the Heliscope, however in 2012 the company went bankrupt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4939-0715-1_6 |author1=Sara El-Metwally |title=Next Generation Sequencing Technologies and Challenges in Sequence Assembly |volume=7 |author2=Osama M.

=== Single molecule real time (SMRT) sequencing ===
{{Main|Single molecule real time sequencing}}
SMRT sequencing is based on the sequencing by synthesis approach. The DNA is synthesized in zero-mode wave-guides (ZMWs)&amp;nbsp;– small well-like containers with the capturing tools located at the bottom of the well. The sequencing is performed with use of unmodified polymerase (attached to the ZMW bottom) and fluorescently labelled nucleotides flowing freely in the solution. The wells are constructed in a way that only the fluorescence occurring by the bottom of the well is detected. The fluorescent label is detached from the nucleotide upon its incorporation into the DNA strand, leaving an unmodified DNA strand. According to [[Pacific Biosciences]] (PacBio), the SMRT technology developer, this methodology allows detection of nucleotide modifications (such as cytosine methylation). This happens through the observation of polymerase kinetics. This approach allows reads of 20,000 nucleotides or more, with average read lengths of 5 kilobases.&lt;ref name="flxlexblog.wordpress.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.genomeweb.com/sequencing/pacbio-sales-start-pick-company-delivers-product-enhancements|title=PacBio Sales Start to Pick Up as Company Delivers on Product Enhancements|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, Pacific Biosciences announced the launch of a new sequencing instrument called the Sequel System, with 1 million ZMWs compared to 150,000 ZMWs in the PacBio RS II instrument.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bio-itworld.com/2015/9/30/pacbio-announces-sequel-sequencing-system.aspx|title=Bio-IT World|website=www.bio-itworld.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.genomeweb.com/business-news/pacbio-launches-higher-throughput-lower-cost-single-molecule-sequencing-system|title=PacBio Launches Higher-Throughput, Lower-Cost Single-Molecule Sequencing System|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; SMRT sequencing is referred to as "[[Third-generation sequencing|third-generation]]" or "long-read" sequencing.

=== Nanopore DNA sequencing ===
{{Main|Nanopore sequencing}}
The DNA passing through the nanopore changes its ion current. This change is dependent on the shape, size and length of the DNA sequence. Each type of the nucleotide blocks the ion flow through the pore for a different period of time. The method does not require modified nucleotides and is performed in real time. Nanopore sequencing is referred to as "[[Third-generation sequencing|third-generation]]" or "long-read" sequencing, along with SMRT sequencing.

Early industrial research into this method was based on a technique called 'Exonuclease sequencing', where the readout of electrical signals occurring at nucleotides passing by [[hemolysin|alpha(α)-hemolysin]] pores covalently bound with [[cyclodextrin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Clarke|first=James|last2=Wu|first2=Hai-Chen|last3=Jayasinghe|first3=Lakmal|last4=Patel|first4=Alpesh|last5=Reid|first5=Stuart|last6=Bayley|first6=Hagan|date=2009-04-01|title=Continuous base identification for single-molecule nanopore DNA sequencing|url=http://www.nature.com/nnano/journal/v4/n4/full/nnano.2009.12.html|journal=Nature Nanotechnology|language=en|volume=4|issue=4|pages=265–70|doi=10.1038/nnano.2009.12|issn=1748-3387|pmid=19350039|bibcode=2009NatNa...4..265C}}&lt;/ref&gt; However the subsequently commercial method, 'strand sequencing' sequencing DNA bases in an intact strand.

Two main areas of nanopore sequencing in development are solid state nanopore sequencing, and protein based nanopore sequencing. Protein nanopore sequencing utilizes membrane protein complexes such as α-hemolysin, MspA (''[[Mycobacterium smegmatis]]'' Porin A) or CssG, which show great promise given their ability to distinguish between individual and groups of nucleotides.&lt;ref name="Torre 2012"&gt;{{cite journal|year=2012|title=Fabrication and characterization of solid-state nanopore arrays for high-throughput DNA sequencing|journal=Nanotechnology|volume=23|issue=38|page=385308|bibcode=2012Nanot..23L5308D|doi=10.1088/0957-4484/23/38/385308|pmc=3557807|pmid=22948520|vauthors=dela Torre R, Larkin J, Singer A, Meller A}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, solid-state nanopore sequencing utilizes synthetic materials such as silicon nitride and aluminum oxide and it is preferred for its superior mechanical ability and thermal and chemical stability.&lt;ref name="Pathak 2012"&gt;{{cite journal|year=2012|title=Double-functionalized nanopore-embedded gold electrodes for rapid DNA sequencing|url=|journal=Applied Physics Letters|volume=100|issue=2|page=023701|doi=10.1063/1.3673335|vauthors=Pathak B, Lofas H, Prasongkit J, Grigoriev A, Ahuja R, Scheicher RH|bibcode=2012ApPhL.100b3701P}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fabrication method is essential for this type of sequencing given that the nanopore array can contain hundreds of pores with diameters smaller than eight nanometers.&lt;ref name="Torre 2012" /&gt;

The concept originated from the idea that single stranded DNA or RNA molecules can be electrophoretically driven in a strict linear sequence through a biological pore that can be less than eight nanometers, and can be detected given that the molecules release an ionic current while moving through the pore.  The pore contains a detection region capable of recognizing different bases, with each base generating various time specific signals corresponding to the sequence of bases as they cross the pore which are then evaluated.&lt;ref name="Pathak 2012" /&gt; Precise control over the DNA transport through the pore is crucial for success. Various enzymes such as exonucleases and polymerases have been used to moderate this process by positioning them near the pore’s entrance.&lt;ref name="Korlach 2008"&gt;{{cite journal|year=2008|title=Selective aluminum passivation for targeted immobilization of single DNA polymerase molecules in zero-mode waveguide nanostructures|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|volume=105|issue=4|pages=1176–81|bibcode=2008PNAS..105.1176K|doi=10.1073/pnas.0710982105|pmc=2234111|pmid=18216253|vauthors=Korlach J, Marks PJ, Cicero RL, Gray JJ, Murphy DL, Roitman DB, Pham TT, Otto GA, Foquet M, Turner SW}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Methods in development ==
DNA sequencing methods currently under development include reading the sequence as a DNA strand transits through [[nanopore sequencing|nanopores]] (a method that is now commercial but subsequent generations such as solid-state nanopores are still in development),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mcb.harvard.edu/branton/index.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020221002907/http://mcb.harvard.edu/branton/index.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=21 February 2002 |title=The Harvard Nanopore Group |publisher=Mcb.harvard.edu |accessdate=2009-11-15 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Physorg"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.physorg.com/news157378086.html |title=Nanopore Sequencing Could Slash DNA Analysis Costs |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and microscopy-based techniques, such as [[Atomic force microscope|atomic force microscopy]] or [[Transmission electron microscopy DNA sequencing|transmission electron microscopy]] that are used to identify the positions of individual nucleotides within long DNA fragments (&amp;gt;5,000 bp) by nucleotide labeling with heavier elements (e.g., halogens) for visual detection and recording.&lt;ref&gt;{{US patent reference

[[Third-generation sequencing|Third generation technologies]] aim to increase throughput and decrease the time to result and cost by eliminating the need for excessive reagents and harnessing the processivity of DNA polymerase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Schadt EE, Turner S, Kasarskis A | title = A window into third-generation sequencing | journal = Human Molecular Genetics | volume = 19 | issue = R2 | pages = R227–40 | year = 2010 | pmid = 20858600 | doi = 10.1093/hmg/ddq416 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Tunnelling currents DNA sequencing ===
Another approach uses measurements of the electrical tunnelling currents across single-strand DNA as it moves through a channel. Depending on its electronic structure, each base affects the tunnelling current differently,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Xu M, Endres RG, Arakawa Y  | title = The electronic properties of DNA bases | journal = Small | volume = 3 | issue = 9 | pages = 1539–43 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17786897 | doi = 10.1002/smll.200600732}}&lt;/ref&gt; allowing differentiation between different bases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Di Ventra M | title = Fast DNA sequencing by electrical means inches closer | journal = Nanotechnology | volume = 24 | issue = 34 | page = 342501 | year = 2013 | pmid = 23899780 | doi = 10.1088/0957-4484/24/34/342501 | bibcode = 2013Nanot..24H2501D }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of tunnelling currents has the potential to sequence orders of magnitude faster than ionic current methods and the sequencing of several DNA oligomers and micro-RNA has already been achieved.&lt;ref name="pmid22787559"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ohshiro T, Matsubara K, Tsutsui M, Furuhashi M, Taniguchi M, Kawai T | title = Single-molecule electrical random resequencing of DNA and RNA | journal = Sci Rep | volume = 2 | issue = | page = 501 | year = 2012 | pmid = 22787559 | pmc = 3392642 | doi = 10.1038/srep00501 |bibcode = 2012NatSR...2E.501O }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sequencing by hybridization ===
''[[Sequencing by hybridization]]'' is a non-enzymatic method that uses a [[DNA microarray]]. A single pool of DNA whose sequence is to be determined is fluorescently labeled and hybridized to an array containing known sequences. Strong hybridization signals from a given spot on the array identifies its sequence in the DNA being sequenced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hanna GJ, Johnson VA, Kuritzkes DR, Richman DD, Martinez-Picado J, Sutton L, Hazelwood JD, D'Aquila RT | title = Comparison of Sequencing by Hybridization and Cycle Sequencing for Genotyping of Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1 Reverse Transcriptase | journal = J. Clin. Microbiol. | volume = 38 | issue = 7 | pages = 2715–21 | date = 1 July 2000 | pmid = 10878069 | pmc = 87006 | url = http://jcm.asm.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=10878069 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This method of sequencing utilizes binding characteristics of a library of short single stranded DNA molecules (oligonucleotides), also called DNA probes, to reconstruct a target DNA sequence. Non-specific hybrids are removed by washing and the target DNA is eluted.&lt;ref name="Morey"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Morey M, Fernández-Marmiesse A, Castiñeiras D, Fraga JM, Couce ML, Cocho JA | title = A glimpse into past, present, and future DNA sequencing | journal = Molecular Genetics and Metabolism | volume = 110 | issue = 1–2 | pages = 3–24 | year = 2013 | pmid = 23742747 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1016/j.ymgme.2013.04.024 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hybrids are re-arranged such that the DNA sequence can be reconstructed. The benefit of this sequencing type is its ability to capture a large number of targets with a homogenous coverage.&lt;ref name="Qin"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Qin Y, Schneider TM, Brenner MP | title = Sequencing by Hybridization of Long Targets | journal = PLoS ONE | volume = 7 | issue = 5 | pages = e35819 | year = 2012 | pmid = 22574124 | pmc = 3344849 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0035819 | editor1-last = Gibas | bibcode = 2012PLoSO...735819Q | editor1-first = Cynthia }}&lt;/ref&gt; A large number of chemicals and starting DNA is usually required. However, with the advent of solution-based hybridization, much less equipment and chemicals are necessary.&lt;ref name="Morey"/&gt;

=== Sequencing with mass spectrometry ===
[[Mass spectrometry]] may be used to determine DNA sequences. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry, or [[Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization|MALDI-TOF MS]], has specifically been investigated as an alternative method to gel electrophoresis for visualizing DNA fragments. With this method, DNA fragments generated by chain-termination sequencing reactions are compared by mass rather than by size. The mass of each nucleotide is different from the others and this difference is detectable by mass spectrometry. Single-nucleotide mutations in a fragment can be more easily detected with MS than by gel electrophoresis alone. MALDI-TOF MS can more easily detect differences between RNA fragments, so researchers may indirectly sequence DNA with MS-based methods by converting it to RNA first.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Edwards JR, Ruparel H, Ju J | title = Mass-spectrometry DNA sequencing | journal = Mutation Research | volume = 573 | issue = 1–2 | pages = 3–12 | year = 2005 | pmid = 15829234 | doi = 10.1016/j.mrfmmm.2004.07.021 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The higher resolution of DNA fragments permitted by MS-based methods is of special interest to researchers in forensic science, as they may wish to find [[single-nucleotide polymorphisms]] in human DNA samples to identify individuals. These samples may be highly degraded so forensic researchers often prefer [[mitochondrial DNA]] for its higher stability and applications for lineage studies. MS-based sequencing methods have been used to compare the sequences of human mitochondrial DNA from samples in a [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] database&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hall TA, Budowle B, Jiang Y, Blyn L, Eshoo M, Sannes-Lowery KA, Sampath R, Drader JJ, Hannis JC, Harrell P, Samant V, White N, Ecker DJ, Hofstadler SA | title = Base composition analysis of human mitochondrial DNA using electrospray ionization mass spectrometry: A novel tool for the identification and differentiation of humans | journal = Analytical Biochemistry | volume = 344 | issue = 1 | pages = 53–69 | year = 2005 | pmid = 16054106 | doi = 10.1016/j.ab.2005.05.028 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and from bones found in mass graves of World War I soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Howard R, Encheva V, Thomson J, Bache K, Chan YT, Cowen S, Debenham P, Dixon A, Krause JU, Krishan E, Moore D, Moore V, Ojo M, Rodrigues S, Stokes P, Walker J, Zimmermann W, Barallon R | title = Comparative analysis of human mitochondrial DNA from World War I bone samples by DNA sequencing and ESI-TOF mass spectrometry | journal = Forensic Science International: Genetics | volume = 7 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–9 | date = 15 Jun 2011 | pmid = 21683667 | doi = 10.1016/j.fsigen.2011.05.009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early chain-termination and TOF MS methods demonstrated read lengths of up to 100 base pairs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Monforte JA, Becker CH | title = High-throughput DNA analysis by time-of-flight mass spectrometry | journal = Nature Medicine | volume = 3 | issue = 3 | pages = 360–62 | date = 1 March 1997 | pmid = 9055869 | doi = 10.1038/nm0397-360 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers have been unable to exceed this average read size; like chain-termination sequencing alone, MS-based DNA sequencing may not be suitable for large ''de novo'' sequencing projects. Even so, a recent study did use the short sequence reads and mass spectroscopy to compare single-nucleotide polymorphisms in pathogenic ''[[Streptococcus]]'' strains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Beres SB, Carroll RK, Shea PR, Sitkiewicz I, Martinez-Gutierrez JC, Low DE, McGeer A, Willey BM, Green K, Tyrrell GJ, Goldman TD, Feldgarden M, Birren BW, Fofanov Y, Boos J, Wheaton WD, Honisch C, Musser JM | title = Molecular complexity of successive bacterial epidemics deconvoluted by comparative pathogenomics | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences | volume = 107 | issue = 9 | pages = 4371–76 | date = 8 February 2010 | pmid = 20142485 | pmc = 2840111 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0911295107 | bibcode = 2010PNAS..107.4371B }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Microfluidic Sanger sequencing ===
{{Main|Sanger sequencing}}
In microfluidic Sanger sequencing the entire thermocycling amplification of DNA fragments as well as their separation by electrophoresis is done on a single glass wafer (approximately 10&amp;nbsp;cm in diameter) thus reducing the reagent usage as well as cost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kan CW, Fredlake CP, Doherty EA, Barron AE | title = DNA sequencing and genotyping in miniaturized electrophoresis systems | journal = Electrophoresis | volume = 25 | issue = 21–22 | pages = 3564–88 | date = 1 November 2004 | pmid = 15565709 | doi = 10.1002/elps.200406161 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In some instances researchers have shown that they can increase the throughput of conventional sequencing through the use of microchips.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Chen YJ, Roller EE, Huang X | title = DNA sequencing by denaturation: experimental proof of concept with an integrated fluidic device | journal = Lab on a Chip | volume = 10 | issue = 9 | pages = 1153–59 | year = 2010 | pmid = 20390134 | pmc = 2881221 | doi = 10.1039/b921417h }}&lt;/ref&gt; Research will still need to be done in order to make this use of technology effective.

=== Microscopy-based techniques ===
{{Main|Transmission electron microscopy DNA sequencing}}
This approach directly visualizes the sequence of DNA molecules using electron microscopy. The first identification of DNA base pairs within intact DNA molecules by enzymatically incorporating modified bases, which contain atoms of increased atomic number, direct visualization and identification of individually labeled bases within a synthetic 3,272 base-pair DNA molecule and a 7,249 base-pair viral genome has been demonstrated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bell DC, Thomas WK, Murtagh KM, Dionne CA, Graham AC, Anderson JE, Glover WR | title = DNA Base Identification by Electron Microscopy | journal = Microscopy and Microanalysis : The Official Journal of Microscopy Society of America, Microbeam Analysis Society, Microscopical Society of Canada | volume = 18 | issue = 5 | pages = 1–5 | date = 9 Oct 2012 | pmid = 23046798 | doi = 10.1017/S1431927612012615 | bibcode = 2012MiMic..18.1049B }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== RNAP sequencing ===
This method is based on use of [[RNA polymerase]] (RNAP), which is attached to a [[polystyrene]] bead. One end of DNA to be sequenced is attached to another bead, with both beads being placed in optical traps. RNAP motion during transcription brings the beads in closer and their relative distance changes, which can then be recorded at a single nucleotide resolution. The sequence is deduced based on the four readouts with lowered concentrations of each of the four nucleotide types, similarly to the Sanger method.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Pareek CS, Smoczynski R, Tretyn A | title = Sequencing technologies and genome sequencing | journal = Journal of Applied Genetics | volume = 52 | issue = 4 | pages = 413–35 | date = November 2011 | pmid = 21698376 | pmc = 3189340 | doi = 10.1007/s13353-011-0057-x }}&lt;/ref&gt; A comparison is made between regions and sequence information is deduced by comparing the known sequence regions to the unknown sequence regions.&lt;ref name="Pareek CS"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Pareek CS, Smoczynski R, Tretyn A | title = Sequencing technologies and genome sequencing | journal = Journal of Applied Genetics | volume = 52 | issue = 4 | pages = 413–35 | year = 2011 | pmid = 21698376 | pmc = 3189340 | doi = 10.1007/s13353-011-0057-x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''In vitro'' virus high-throughput sequencing ===
A method has been developed to analyze full sets of [[Interactome|protein interactions]] using a combination of 454 pyrosequencing and an  ''in vitro'' virus [[mRNA display]] method. Specifically, this method covalently links proteins of interest to the mRNAs encoding them, then detects the mRNA pieces using reverse transcription [[Polymerase chain reaction|PCR]]s. The mRNA may then be amplified and sequenced. The combined method was titled IVV-HiTSeq and can be performed under cell-free conditions, though its results may not be representative of ''in vivo'' conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fujimori S, Hirai N, Ohashi H, Masuoka K, Nishikimi A, Fukui Y, Washio T, Oshikubo T, Yamashita T, Miyamoto-Sato E | title = Next-generation sequencing coupled with a cell-free display technology for high-throughput production of reliable interactome data | journal = Scientific Reports | volume = 2 | page = 691 | year = 2012 | pmid = 23056904 | pmc = 3466446 | doi = 10.1038/srep00691 | bibcode = 2012NatSR...2E.691F }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sample preparation ==
The success of any DNA sequencing protocol relies upon the DNA or RNA sample extraction and preparation from the biological material of interest.
* A successful DNA extraction will yield a DNA sample with long, non-degraded strands. 
* A successful RNA extraction will yield a RNA sample that should be converted to complementary DNA (cDNA) using reverse transcriptase—a DNA polymerase that synthesizes a complementary DNA based on existing strands of RNA in a PCR-like manner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Harbers M | year = 2008 | title = The Current Status of cDNA Cloning | url = | journal = Genomics | volume = 91 | issue = 3| pages = 232–42 | doi = 10.1016/j.ygeno.2007.11.004 | pmid = 18222633 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Complementary DNA can then be processed the same way as genomic DNA.

According to the sequencing technology to be used, the samples resulting from either the DNA or the RNA extraction require further preparation.  For Sanger sequencing, either cloning procedures or PCR are required prior to sequencing. In the case of next-generation sequencing methods, library preparation is required before processing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Alberti A, Belser C, Engelen S, Bertrand L, Orvain C, Brinas L, Cruaud C, etal | year = 2014 | title = Comparison of Library Preparation Methods Reveals Their Impact on Interpretation of Metatranscriptomic Data | journal = BMC Genomics | volume = 15 | issue = | pages = 912–12 | doi = 10.1186/1471-2164-15-912 | pmid=25331572 | pmc=4213505}}&lt;/ref&gt; Assessing the quality and quantity of nucleic acids both after extraction and after library preparation identifies degraded, fragmented, and low-purity samples and yields high-quality sequencing data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= https://www.illumina.com/content/dam/illumina-marketing/documents/products/appnotes/library-qc-fragment-analyzer-application-note-770-2017-002.pdf|title=Scalable Nucleic Acid Quality Assessments for Illumina Next-Generation Sequencing Library Prep|accessdate=2017-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Development initiatives ==
[[File:Historic cost of sequencing a human genome.svg|thumb|280px|Total cost of sequencing a human genome over time as calculated by the [[National Human Genome Research Institute|NHGRI]].]]
In October 2006, the [[X Prize Foundation]] established an initiative to promote the development of [[full genome sequencing]] technologies, called the [[Archon X Prize]], intending to award $10 million to "the first Team that can build a device and use it to sequence 100 human genomes within 10 days or less, with an accuracy of no more than one error in every 100,000 bases sequenced, with sequences accurately covering at least 98% of the genome, and at a recurring cost of no more than $10,000 (US) per genome."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://genomics.xprize.org/|title=Archon Genomics XPRIZE|website=Archon Genomics XPRIZE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each year the [[National Human Genome Research Institute]], or NHGRI, promotes grants for new research and developments in [[genomics]]. 2010 grants and 2011 candidates include continuing work in microfluidic, polony and base-heavy sequencing methodologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.genome.gov/10000004|title=Grant Information|website=National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Computational challenges ==
The sequencing technologies described here produce raw data that needs to be assembled into longer sequences such as complete genomes ([[sequence assembly]]). There are many computational challenges to achieve this, such as the evaluation of the raw sequence data which is done by programs and algorithms such as [[Phred base calling|Phred]] and [[Phrap]]. Other challenges have to deal with [[Repetitive DNA|repetitive]] sequences that often prevent complete genome assemblies because they occur in many places of the genome. As a consequence, many sequences may not be assigned to particular [[chromosome]]s. The production of raw sequence data is only the beginning of its detailed [[Bioinformatics|bioinformatical]] analysis.&lt;ref name="pmid24727769"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Severin J, Lizio M, Harshbarger J, Kawaji H, Daub CO, Hayashizaki Y, Bertin N, Forrest AR | title = Interactive visualization and analysis of large-scale sequencing datasets using ZENBU | journal = Nat. Biotechnol. | volume = 32 | issue = 3 | pages = 217–19 | year = 2014 | pmid = 24727769 | doi = 10.1038/nbt.2840 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet new methods for sequencing and correcting sequencing errors were developed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Shmilovici A, Ben-Gal I | title = Using a VOM model for reconstructing potential coding regions in EST sequences|journal=Computational Statistics | year = 2007 | volume = 22 | issue = 1 | pages = 49–69 | doi = 10.1007/s00180-007-0021-8 | url = http://www.eng.tau.ac.il/~bengal/VOM_EST.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Read trimming ===
Sometimes, the raw reads produced by the sequencer are correct and precise only in a fraction of their length. Using the entire read may introduce artifacts in the downstream analyses like genome assembly, snp calling, or gene expression estimation. Two classes of trimming programs have been introduced, based on the window-based or the running-sum classes of algorithms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Del Fabbro C, Scalabrin S, Morgante M, Giorgi FM | title = An Extensive Evaluation of Read Trimming Effects on Illumina NGS Data Analysis | journal = PLoS ONE | volume = 8 | issue = 12 | pages = e85024 | year = 2013 | pmid = 24376861 | pmc = 3871669 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0085024 | bibcode = 2013PLoSO...885024D }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is a partial list of the trimming algorithms currently available, specifying the algorithm class they belong to:

Human genetics have been included within the field of [[bioethics]] since the early 1970s&lt;ref name="ethics-murray"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Murray|first1=TH|title=Ethical issues in human genome research.|journal=FASEB Journal|date=January 1991|volume=5|issue=1|pages=55–60|pmid=1825074}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the growth in the use of DNA sequencing (particularly high-throughput sequencing) has introduced a number of ethical issues. One key issue is the ownership of an individual's DNA and the data produced when that DNA is sequenced.&lt;ref name="usd1000-genome-ethics"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Robertson|first1=John A.|title=The $1000 Genome: Ethical and Legal Issues in Whole Genome Sequencing of Individuals|journal=The American Journal of Bioethics|date=August 2003|volume=3|issue=3|pages=35–42|doi=10.1162/152651603322874762|pmid=14735880}}&lt;!--|accessdate=20 May 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding the DNA molecule itself, the leading legal case on this topic, ''[[Moore v. Regents of the University of California]]'' (1990) ruled that individuals have no property rights to discarded cells or any profits made using these cells (for instance, as a patented [[cell line]]). However, individuals have a right to informed consent regarding removal and use of cells. Regarding the data produced through DNA sequencing, ''Moore'' gives the individual no rights to the information derived from their DNA.&lt;ref name="usd1000-genome-ethics" /&gt;

As DNA sequencing becomes more widespread, the storage, security and sharing of genomic data has also become more important.&lt;ref name="usd1000-genome-ethics" /&gt;&lt;ref name="guardian-ethics"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Henderson|first1=Mark|title=Human genome sequencing: the real ethical dilemmas|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2013/sep/09/genetics-ethics-human-gene-sequencing|website=The Guardian|accessdate=20 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, one concern is that insurers may use an individual's genomic data to modify their quote, depending on the perceived future health of the individual based on their DNA.&lt;ref name="guardian-ethics" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ny-times-insurance-ethics"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Harmon|first1=Amy|title=Insurance Fears Lead Many to Shun DNA Tests|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/24/health/24dna.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0|website=The New York Times|accessdate=20 May 2015|date=24 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2008, the [[Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act]] (GINA) was signed in the United States, prohibiting discrimination on the basis of genetic information with respect to health insurance and employment.&lt;ref name="OMB support"&gt;[http://www.genome.gov/Pages/PolicyEthics/GeneticDiscrimination/SAPonHR493.pdf Statement of Administration policy], Executive Office of the President, Office of Management and Budget, 27 April 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Signing"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.genome.gov/27026050|title=President Bush Signs the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act of 2008|author=National Human Genome Research Institute|date=21 May 2008| accessdate=17 Feb 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, the US [[Presidential Commission for the Study of Bioethical Issues]] reported that existing privacy legislation for DNA sequencing data such as GINA and the [[Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act]] were insufficient, noting that whole-genome sequencing data was particularly sensitive, as it could be used to identify not only the individual from which the data was created, but also their relatives.&lt;ref name="nature-ethics"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Baker|first1=Monya|title=US ethics panel reports on DNA sequencing and privacy|url=http://blogs.nature.com/news/2012/10/us-ethics-panel-reports-on-dna-sequencing-and-privacy.html|website=Nature New Blog|accessdate=20 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="privacy-progress-report"&gt;{{cite web|title=Privacy and Progress in Whole Genome Sequencing|url=http://bioethics.gov/sites/default/files/PrivacyProgress508_1.pdf|publisher=Presidential Commission for the Study of Bioethical Issues|accessdate=20 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ethical issues have also been raised by the increasing use of genetic variation screening, both in newborns, and in adults by companies such as [[23andMe]].&lt;ref name="ethics-newborns"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Goldenberg|first1=Aaron J.|last2=Sharp|first2=Richard R.|title=The Ethical Hazards and Programmatic Challenges of Genomic Newborn Screening|journal=[[JAMA (journal)|JAMA]]|date=1 February 2012|volume=307|issue=5|pages=461–2|doi=10.1001/jama.2012.68|pmid=22298675|pmc=3868436}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ethics-hughes"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hughes|first1=Virginia|title=It’s Time To Stop Obsessing About the Dangers of Genetic Information|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/medical_examiner/2013/01/ethics_of_genetic_information_whole_genome_sequencing_is_here_and_we_need.html|website=Slate Magazine|accessdate=22 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been asserted that screening for genetic variations can be harmful, increasing [[anxiety]] in individuals who have been found to have an increased risk of disease.&lt;ref name="ethics-bloss"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bloss|first1=Cinnamon S.|last2=Schork|first2=Nicholas J.|last3=Topol|first3=Eric J.|title=Effect of Direct-to-Consumer Genomewide Profiling to Assess Disease Risk|journal=New England Journal of Medicine|date=10 February 2011|volume=364|issue=6|pages=524–34|doi=10.1056/NEJMoa1011893|pmid=21226570|pmc=3786730}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in one case noted in ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', doctors screening an ill baby for genetic variants chose not to inform the parents of an unrelated variant linked to [[dementia]] due to the harm it would cause to the parents.&lt;ref name="ethics-time"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rochman|first1=Bonnie|title=What Your Doctor Isn’t Telling You About Your DNA|url=http://healthland.time.com/2012/10/25/what-your-doctor-isnt-telling-you-about-your-dna/|website=Time.com|accessdate=22 May 2015|date=25 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a 2011 study in ''[[The New England Journal of Medicine]]'' has shown that individuals undergoing disease risk profiling did not show increased levels of anxiety.&lt;ref name="ethics-bloss" /&gt;

'''Death and adjustment hypotheses''' ('''DAH''') is a theory about death and dying that focuses on [[death anxiety (psychology)]] and adjustment to death.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://glencoe.mcgraw-hill.com/sites/dl/free/0078883601/680442/Additional_Lifespan_Development_Topics.pdf Theories on Death and Dying]'', McGraw-Hill, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; It was presented by [[Mohammad Samir Hossain]] as an answer to the overwhelming anxiety and grief about death.&lt;ref&gt;Md Zakaria Siddique, "A review of ''Quest for a New Death: Death and Adjustment Hypotheses''", ''Death Studies'', vol. 33, no. 2 (2009).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Karen Meyers, Robert N. Golden, and Fred Peterson (eds.). ''The Truth about Death and Dying''. 2nd ed. New York: DWJ Books, 2009, p. 106.&lt;/ref&gt; In an attempt to find the resolution to death anxiety, predominantly the existential one, DAH postulates two key themes. Its first part postulates that death should not be considered the end of existence and the second part emphasizes that the belief in immortal pattern of human existence can only be adopted in a morally rich life with the attitude towards morality and materialism balanced mutually.

==Beginning==

The theory was first promoted in the book ''Quest for a New Death: Death and Adjustment Hypotheses'' in 2007. A second book with its elaboration, ''Human Immortality: Death and Adjustment Hypotheses Elaborated'', was published in 2008. Both books were authored by Hossain. Later the journal ''[[Death Studies]]'' and [[Royal College of Psychiatrists]] reviewed these publications for the readerships in Scientific Thanatology and Spiritual Psychiatry.&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert, P. (2009). Human Adjustment and the Problem of Death. Death Studies, 33 (8), 771–774&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Siddique, M. Z. (2009)Reviewing the Phenomenon of Death—A Scientific Effort from the Islamic World. Death Studies, 33 (2), 190–195&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fenwick, P. (2009). Book Reviewing by Dr. Peter Fenwick. Newsletter, 27, Spirituality and Special Interest Group. The Royal College of Psychiatrists. London. at http://www.rcpsych.ac.uk/college/specialinterestgroups/spirituality/publications/newsletter27.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;  After the analyses of the reviewers were published, the [[Royal College of Psychiatrists]] at London published the theory itself as the short article ''Facing the Finality: Death and Adjustment Hypotheses''&lt;ref&gt;http://rcpsych.ac.uk/pdf/Hossain%20Facing%20the%20Finality.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Taylor &amp; Francis]] publication ''Journal of Loss and Trauma'' did the same in its article "Introducing Death and Adjustment Hypotheses".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Mohammad Samir Hossain. "Introducing Death and Adjustment Hypotheses". ''Journal of Loss and Trauma'', vol. 15, no. 4 (2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Hossain was intolerant to death himself. His childhood was terrified with the anticipatory thoughts of his parents' death. When his elder son Mohammad Seeyam Samir died, parallel to developing support for himself, Hossain decided to put forward his resolutions for death anxiety and grief through the scientific readerships. His research works during and after that period gave birth to the articles and books that he later published promoting the theory and for sufferers of intense death anxiety. Hossain's works on the theory further flourished as his parents' terminal illnesses appeared and compelled him to adjust himself comprehensively to the phenomenon of death for a peaceful personal life. He admitted in one of his autobiographical articles that without the turmoils in his own life he could never realize about the disasters and work to prevent them.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hossain, MS, 2011, Abstinence: A Memoir, Journal of Loss and Trauma, 16:5&lt;/ref&gt;

==Key components==

Factors behind the DAH are described in ''European Psychiatry'', Volume 26, Supplement 1, Page 1727 in the following manner –

"Viewed from a naturalistic and scientific perspective, death appears to represent the permanent cessation of human existence, contributing to the widespread experience of death anxiety. The present argument attempts to deconstruct this argument on epistemological grounds by analyzing
1) the prevailing universal concept of death in naturalistic discourse, &lt;br/&gt;
2) the issue of our adjustment to this presumed reality, and &lt;br/&gt;
3) the relationship between existence and death in the context of their social evolution. &lt;br/&gt;
Integrating this conceptual analysis with empirical observations, the paper then explores the contrasting postulate, namely that death may not be the end of our existence, and the moral
implications of this alternative assumption. This position, termed the "death adjustment hypotheses," would seem to offer an alternative grounding for theory and research in Thanatology."

===Concept of death===

Finding a common platform regarding the concept of death was the first step towards this work. Dr Hossain's finding was that without a common idea about death people will not be able to share the same remedy for death anxiety.&lt;ref name="MohammadSamir"&gt;Mohammad Samir Hossain and Peter Gilbert. 2010. Concepts of Death: A key to our adjustment. ''Illness, Crisis and Loss'', Vol 18. No 1&lt;/ref&gt; There are many scientific approaches to the concept. For example, brain death, as practiced in medical science, defines death as a point in time at which brain activity ceases.&lt;ref name="MohammadSamir" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://highered.mcgraw-hill.com/sites/dl/free/0078883601/680442/Additional_Lifespan_Development_Topics.pdf |title=Additional Lifespan Development Topics |publisher=McGraw-Hill Companies |accessdate=2014-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rcpsych.ac.uk/pdf/Fenwick%20Book%20Review%20Human%20Immortality;%20%20Death%20and%20Adjustment%20Hypotheses%20Elaborated.x.x.pdf Human Immortality; Death and Adjustment Hypotheses Elaborated.] Book Review by Dr. Peter Fenwick&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rcpsych.ac.uk/pdf/Hossain%20Facing%20the%20Finality.pdf Facing the finality – Death and Adjustment Hypotheses] Dr. Mohammad Samir Hossain, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; It was Hossain's claim that whenever death is taken as permanent and absolute cessation of human existence, morbid fear of death begins; therefore DAH he presented with different ideas of death in relation to existence to reach a conclusion that will be acceptable to most.&lt;ref name="Hossain, M S 2007"&gt;Hossain, M S. 2007. Quest for a new death: Death and Adjustment Hypotheses. Booksurge Publishing, Charleston, US&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death anxiety as a whole===

Death anxiety is the central concern of DAH. It is the morbid, abnormal or persistent fear of one's own death or the process of his/her dying. One definition of death anxiety is a "feeling of dread, apprehension or solicitude (anxiety) when one thinks of the process of dying, or ceasing to ‘be’".&lt;ref&gt;Definition by Farley G.: Death anxiety. National Health Service UK. 2010, found in: {{cite journal|url=http://benthamscience.com/open/tonursj/articles/V007/14TONURSJ.pdf |title=How death anxiety impacts nurses' caring for patients at the end of life: a review of literature |vauthors=Peters L, Cant R, Payne S, O'Connor M, McDermott F, Hood K, Morphet J, Shimoinaba K |journal=Open Nurs J. |year=2013 |volume=7 |pages=14–21 |doi=10.2174/1874434601307010014 |pmid=23400515 |pmc=3565229 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131014172346/http://benthamscience.com/open/tonursj/articles/V007/14TONURSJ.pdf |archivedate=2013-10-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also referred to as thanatophobia (fear of death), and is distinguished from  [[necrophobia]], which is a specific fear of  dead or dying persons and/or things (i.e. others who are dead or dying, not one's own death or dying).&lt;ref&gt;The American Heritage® Dictionary of the English Language, Fourth Edition copyright ©2000 by Houghton Mifflin Company. Updated in 2009. Published by Houghton Mifflin Company&lt;/ref&gt; DAH proposes that no one is free from this anxiety unless there is something significantly positive in the phenomenon of death for humans. Hossain claimed, the idea of 'cessation of existence' through death is the prime factor responsible for initiating death anxiety in one.&lt;ref&gt;Hossain, M S.2008. Human Immortality: Death and Adjustment Hypotheses Elaborated. Booksurge Publishing, Charleston, US.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Existential death anxiety===

It is apparent that Hossain's description of death anxiety in DAH actually overlaps the idea of existential death anxiety, which is the basic knowledge and awareness that life must end. However, DAH indicates 'existence' as the primary humane need and 'pleasure' as the secondary one. Therefore, DAH postulates, though existential death anxiety strongly correlates behavioral changes,&lt;ref name=langs&gt;Langs, R. (1997). Death Anxiety and Clinical Practice. London: Karnac Books; Langs, R. (2004). "Death anxiety and the emotion-processing mind," ''Psychoanalytic Psychology'', vol. 21, no.1, 31-53; Langs, R. (2004) ''Fundamentals of Adaptive Psychotherapy and Counseling''. London: Palgrave-Macmillan&lt;/ref&gt; pleasure in existence must be ensured to maintain the balance between life and death peacefully. Hossain, in the iteration of DAH, highlighted how this sort of death anxiety evolved in the society through time based on his analysis of the history of the West starting from 5th century up to 20th century. DAH adds that assurance of pleasure or pain-free status in any existence after death is another key factor in adjusting with the phenomenon of death even if one is not overwhelmed by existential death anxiety due to his/her belief in any sort of existence after death.&lt;ref&gt;Hossain, M S. 2008. Human Immortality: Death and Adjustment Hypotheses Elaborated. Booksurge Publishing. Charleston, US&lt;/ref&gt;

===Materialism, immorality and judgment issues===
Hossain explained, as existence after death creates the scope for being judged and punished for the immoral deeds in life, most self-claimed believers pass through the denial of afterlife for their immorality in search of limitless materialistic pleasure. Therefore, one of the key propositions of DAH was the fact that mostly humans abandon their moral ethics due to heightened materialism that gives birth to existential death anxiety even among the self-claimed believers in the existence after death.&lt;ref name="Hossain, M S 2007"/&gt;&lt;ref name=MeyersGoldenPeterson&gt;Karen Meyers, Robert N. Golden, Fred Peterson. Infobase Publishing, 2009, 106 page. Retrieved from https://books.google.com/books?id=V-wan_XhkzcC&amp;pg=PA106&amp;lpg=PA106&amp;dq=Mohammad+Samir+Hossain&lt;/ref&gt;

==Declarations of the Death and adjustment hypotheses==

As outlined very briefly in journal articles, DAH hypothesizes the following for optimum attitude towards death as well as to harmonize the adjustment problems in relation to the phenomenon:&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

*Death and Adjustment Hypotheses – One: In the absence of empirical evidence from science, to regard death to be not our absolute end seems natural and is an epistemologically sound point of view. Therefore, it is also more useful practically and for our adjustment to the phenomenon.
*Death and Adjustment Hypotheses – Two: Changing our materialistic view to a moral one on life can help eradicate the social denial of death through the establishment of a sound concept of the phenomenon at personal and societal level, which should also potentate our adjustment to the phenomenon.

'''Dirk Wouter Johannes "Dick" van Dijk''' (15 February 1946 – 8 July 1997) was a Dutch [[association football|footballer]] who played for [[FC Twente]] and [[Ajax Amsterdam]]. He was a member of Ajax's [[UEFA Champions League|European Cup]] victory in [[European Cup 1970-71|1971]]. He earned seven caps for the [[Netherlands national football team]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.voetbalstats.nl/nedxi/sp106.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-03-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080407232406/http://www.voetbalstats.nl/nedxi/sp106.html |archivedate=7 April 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Club career==
Dick van Dijk grew up in [[Gouda, South Holland|Gouda]] and played football in his youth in the local amateur club. When he was sixteen, he met coach [[Hans Croon]] of [[Schiedamse Voetbal Vereniging|SVV]], with whom he played in the Second division. Van Dijk was the top scorer for the club in 1966 when SVV won promotion to the First Division. He was invited to the Dutch youth team and the Dutch military team. The scoring ability of the young star attracted the interest of [[FC Twente]], but the asking price of 200,000 guilders was too much. A less impressive season ensured that the transfer fee a year later had dropped to 70,000 guilders, with Van Dijk joining FC Twente in the summer of 1967.

At Twente, Van Dijk formed a strong attacking partnership with Theo Pahlplatz, scoring 22 times and helping a youthful side to a creditable eighth-place finish in his first season. The following year Van Dijk finished as  top scorer in the Premier League with 30 goals. In a legendary home match against Ajax on 3 November 1968, Twente won 5–1 and Van Dijk scored three goals. It is believed that this contest sparked the interest of Ajax in Van Dijk, who in June 1969 moved to Amsterdam for a transfer fee of 750,000 guilders.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nos.nl/artikel/564171-twente-topper-werd-ajax-teamspeler.html Twente-topper werd Ajax-teamspeler] - NOS {{nl|icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While Van Dijk had been a star player at Twente, he had to fight for a spot at Ajax, becoming as a result a more complete footballer who knew how to defend. In his first season, he scored 23 goals in 32 matches. Although not a regular starter during his second season, he nonetheless scored 18 goals in 29 matches. Van Dijk started in the final of the European Cup on June 1971 against [[Panathinaikos F.C.|Panathinaikos]], scoring with a header after five minutes in Ajax's 2–0 victory.

After a third season at Ajax, where he was mainly a reserve player, Van Dijk departed in 1972 to [[OGC Nice]] in [[France]]. There he scored frequently, helping the team to a second-place finish in season 1972/1973. On September 19, 1973, Nice achieved a remarkable 3-0 victory in the first leg of their UEFA Cup tie with  [[FC Barcelona]], whose coach was Dutchman [[Rinus Michels]] and whose star player (although he did not figure in the match) was [[Johan Cruijff]]. (Nice would go on to win the tie 3-2 on aggregate.) In 1974, Van Dijk joined [[Real Murcia]] in [[Spain]], and a year later ended his football career.

==International career==
Meanwhile, Van Dijk had made his international debut on 26 March 1969 in a match for the Dutch national team against [[Luxembourg national football team|Luxembourg]]. Van Dijk scored once in a 4–0 victory.

On 10 October 1971 Van Dijk played his seventh and final international match against [[East Germany national football team|East Germany]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://eu-football.info/_player.php?id=21776 Intl career stats] - EU Football&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
After his playing career, he went back to Nice, working as a broker and living in nearby [[Saint-Paul-de-Vence]].

===Death===
In 1997, he died suddenly at 51 years of age from [[acute endocarditis]], a bacterial infection of the heart valves.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.trouw.nl/home/oud-ajacied-dick-van-dijk-51-overleden~a2cdc414/ Oud-Ajacied Dick van Dijk (51) overleden] - Trouw {{nl|icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his memory, a benefit match was organized on 12 October 1997 between ONA Gouda and the Ajax of the Europe Cup I-finals from 1971. In May 2017, 20 years after his death, another matched was staged in his memory between former Ajax players and Nice.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ad.nl/nederlands-voetbal/speciale-wedstrijd-op-de-toekomst-ter-ere-van-dick-van-dijk~a3bb8b46/ Speciale wedstrijd op De Toekomst ter ere van Dick van Dijk] - AD {{nl|icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{For|the 1843 short story|Egotism; or, The Bosom-Serpent}}
{{Other uses|Egoist (disambiguation)}}
{{refimprove|date=January 2016}}
'''Egotism''' is the drive to maintain and enhance favorable views of oneself, and generally features an inflated opinion of one's personal features and importance. It often includes intellectual, physical, social and other overestimations.&lt;ref&gt;Robin M. Kowalski ed., ''Aversive Interpersonal Behaviors'' (1997) p. 112&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;

The egotist has an overwhelming sense of the centrality of the 'Me', that is to say of their personal qualities.&lt;ref&gt;William Walker Atkinson, ''The New Psychology'' (2010 [1909]) p. 30&lt;/ref&gt; Egotism means placing oneself at the core of one's world with no concern for others, including those "loved" or considered as "close", in any other terms except those subjectively set by the egotist.{{cn|date=January 2016}}

==Characteristics==
Egotism is closely related to an egocentric love for one's imagined self or [[narcissism]] – indeed some would say "by egotism we may envisage a kind of socialized narcissism".&lt;ref&gt;Samuel D. Schmalhausen, ''Why We Misbehave'' (2004 [1928]) p. 55&lt;/ref&gt; Egotists have a strong tendency to talk about themselves  in a self-promoting fashion, and they may well be arrogant and boastful with a [[grandiose]] sense of their own importance.&lt;ref&gt;Kowalski ed., p. 1114&lt;/ref&gt; Their inability to recognise the accomplishments of others&lt;ref&gt;Mark R. Leary, ''The Curse of the Self'' (OUP 2007) p. 91&lt;/ref&gt; leaves them profoundly self-promoting; while sensitivity to criticism may lead on the egotist's part to [[narcissistic rage]] at a sense of insult.&lt;ref&gt;Kowalski ed., p. 121-2&lt;/ref&gt;

Egotism differs from both [[altruism]] – or acting to gain ''fewer'' values than are being given – and from [[egoism]], the constant pursuit of one's self-interest. Various forms of "empirical egoism" have been considered consistent with egotism, but do not – which is also the case with egotism in general –  necessitate having an inflated sense of self.&lt;ref&gt;Kowalski ed., p. 113&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
In developmental terms, two rather different trajectories can be distinguished with respect to egotism – the one individual, the other cultural.

With respect to the developing individual, a movement takes place from egocentricity to sociality during the process of growing up.&lt;ref&gt;[[J. C. Flügel]], ''Man, Morals and Society'' (1973) p. 242–3&lt;/ref&gt; It is normal for an infant to have an inflated – almost a majestic – sense of egotism.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sigmund Freud]], ''On Metapsychology'' (PFL 11) p. 85&lt;/ref&gt;  The over-evaluation of one's own ego&lt;ref&gt;[[Otto Fenichel]], ''The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis'' (London 1946) p. 38 and p. 57&lt;/ref&gt; regularly appears in childish forms of love – in large part because the baby is to himself everything, [[Omnipotence|omnipotent]] to the best of their own  knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robin Skynner]] and [[John Cleese]], ''Families and how to survive them'' (London 1994) p. 91&lt;/ref&gt;

Optimal development allows a gradual reconciliation to a more realistic view of one's own place in the world – a lessening of the egotistical swollen head.&lt;ref&gt;Skynner &amp; Cleese, ''Families'' p. 63&lt;/ref&gt; Less adequate adjustment may later lead to what has been called defensive egotism, serving to overcompensate for the fragility of the underlying concept of self.&lt;ref&gt;Kowalski ed., p. 224&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robin Skynner]] however considered that in the main growing up leads to a state where "your ego is still there, but it's taking its proper limited place among all the other egos".&lt;ref&gt;Robin Skynner and John Cleese, ''Life and how to survive it'' (London 1994) p. 241&lt;/ref&gt;

However, alongside such a positive trajectory of diminishing ''individual'' egotism, a rather different arc of development can be noted in cultural terms, linked to what has been seen as the increasing infantilism of (post)modern society.&lt;ref&gt;R. Bly and M. Woodman, ''The Maiden King'' (1999) p. 85–8&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas in the nineteenth century egotism was still widely regarded as a traditional vice – for [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]] egotism was a sort of diseased self-contemplation&lt;ref&gt;Malcolm Cowley, ed., ''The Portable Hawthorne'' (Penguin 1977) p. 177&lt;/ref&gt; – [[Romanticism]] had already set in motion a countervailing current, what [[Richard Eldridge]] described as a kind of "cultural egotism, substituting the individual imagination for vanishing social tradition".&lt;ref&gt;Richard Eldridge, ''The Persistence of Romanticism'' (2001) p. 118&lt;/ref&gt; The romantic idea of the self-creating individual – of a self-authorizing, artistic egotism&lt;ref&gt;Scott Wilson, in Patricia Waugh, ed., ''Literary Theory and Criticism'' (2006) p. 563–4&lt;/ref&gt; – then took on broader social dimensions in the following century. [[Keats]] might still attack [[Wordsworth]] for the regressive nature of his retreat into the egotistical sublime;&lt;ref&gt;Henry Hart, ''Robert Lowell and the Sublime'' (1995) p. 30&lt;/ref&gt; but by the close of the twentieth century egotism had been naturalized much more widely by the [[Me generation]] into the [[Culture of Narcissism]].

In the 21st century, romantic egotism has been seen as feeding into techno-capitalism in two complementary ways:&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, p. 565-6&lt;/ref&gt; on the one hand, through the self-centred consumer, focused on their own self-fashioning through brand 'identity'; on the other through the equally egotistical voices of 'authentic' protest,  as they rage against the machine, only to produce new commodity forms that serve to fuel the system for further consumption.

==Sex==
There is a question mark over the relationship between sex and egotism. [[Sigmund Freud]] popularly made the claim that love can transform the egotist,&lt;ref&gt;Schmalhausen, p. 153&lt;/ref&gt; giving him or her a new sense of  humility in relation to others.&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''On Metapsychology'' (PFL 11) p. 93&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time, it is very apparent that egotism can readily show itself in sexual ways&lt;ref&gt;Schmalhausen, p. 34&lt;/ref&gt; and indeed arguably one's whole sexuality may function in the service of egotistical needs.&lt;ref&gt;Otto Fenichel, ''The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis'' (London 1946) p. 516-7&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The term egotism is derived from the Greek ("εγώ") and subsequently its Latinised ego (''[[Id, ego and super-ego#Ego|ego]]''), meaning "self" or "I," and ''[[-ism]]'', used to denote a system of belief. As such, the term shares early etymology with [[wikt:egoism|egoism]].

==Cultural examples==
* [[A. A. Milne]] has been praised for his clear-eyed vision of the ruthless, open, unashamed egotism of the young child.&lt;ref&gt;Ann Thwaite, ''A. A. Milne: His Life'' (2006) p. 123 and p. 194&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Ryan Holiday]] described our cultural values as dependent on validation, entitled, and ruled by our emotions, a form of egotism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ego Is The Enemy|last=Holiday|first=Ryan|publisher=Penguin Random House|year=2016|isbn=9780698192157|location=New York|pages=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Elphidium''''' is an abundant genus of [[foraminifera]]. Species can be found from coastal regions out to the continental slope, and in all temperature ranges. Like other forams, [[fossil]]s from different species are used to date rocks. The taxonomy of the species within this genus is disputed due to the high variability of some species.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schweizer|first=Magali|last2=Polovodova|first2=Irina|last3=Nikulina|first3=Anna|last4=Schonfeld|first4=Joachim|date=March 2011|title=Molecular identification of Ammonia and Elphidium species (Foraminifera, Rotaliida) from the Kiel Fjord (SW Baltic Sea) with rDNA sequences|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10152-010-0194-3|journal=Helgoland Marine Research|volume=65|pages=1|via=Springer|doi=10.1007/s10152-010-0194-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
''Elphidium'' is generally around 1&amp;nbsp;mm in size. The [[Test (biology)|test]] is spiral-shaped, and can be red, orange, or brown. This shell is made up of either [[calcium carbonate]] or silica. It may incorporate sand or parts of other organisms, such as [[sponge]]s.&lt;ref&gt;"Elphidium." ''Encyclopedia of Animals'', 8/1/2017, p. 1. EBSCO''host'', ezproxyles.flo.org/login?url=&lt;nowiki&gt;http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=prh&amp;AN=20073694&amp;site=eds-live&amp;scope=site&lt;/nowiki&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; It has seven to twenty chambers in the final whorl, and may have an umbilical plug on each side. {{Citation needed|date=February 2018}} In some species the rim is sharp, while in others it is more rounded. Another distinctive feature is the retral processes (small backward extensions of the chamber walls) that cross the sutures, giving some the appearance of tiny rolled up glass baskets. {{Citation needed|date=February 2018}} ''Elphidium'' crawls using a type of [[Pseudopodia|pseudopod]] called [[reticulopodium|reticulopodia]].

==Life cycle==
''Elphidium'' shows dimorphism with [[Alternation of generations|alternating generations]]. 
The complete cycle for ''Elphidium crispum'' takes two years in the shallower marine regions, although it may be delayed at deeper stations. 
[[Asexual reproduction]] reaches a peak in spring of the first year. 
Sexual reproduction  begins early in the second spring as temperatures begin to rise. 
The gametes conjugate outside in open sea to produce zygotes and the B form then develops and matures during the second summer.
Lister (1895) observed ''Elphidium''  in two different forms as megalospheric form (sexual form) and microsperic form (asexual form). The megalosperic form was developed from the microsperic form. The [[gamete]]s which gives rise to microspheric form by [[Fertilisation|syngamy]]. 
''Elphidium'' exhibits an alternation of generation in its life cycle. The megalosperic forms alternates with microspheric forms. The microspheric forms are developed by the conjugation or syngamy. It means there is always an alternations of asexual (microspheric) and sexual (megalospheric) generation in ''Elphidium''.
The microspheric form reproduces asexually by [[Fission (biology)|fission]] to produce a number of amoebulae. The inner [[cytoplasm]] mass containing several [[Cell nucleus|nuclei]] creeps out of the shell and remains as a lump around it. A small amount of cytoplasm collects around each nucleus. As a result, a large number of amoeboid cells are formed. Each amoebula secretes the proloculum, formsrhizopodia, then it grows and forms other chambers of the shell to become a megalospheric forms.
The megalospheric form reproduces sexually by syngamy or conjugation. During sexual reproduction in megalospheric forms, nucleus first breaks up into many small nuclei and the cytoplasm collects around each of these nuclei. The nuclei divide twice giving rise to a large haploid and known as isogametes. {{clarify|date=February 2018}} Isogametes of two different individuals fuse in pairs to form zygotes. These are then develops into microspheric form.
The life cycle of ''Elphidium'' may be summarized as follows: the microspheric forms produce amoebulae by asexual fission which develops into megalospheric forms. The megalospheric forms produce flagellated isogametes which after syngamy produce zygotes that develop into microspheric forms. Thus, its life cycle clearly exhibits the phenomenon of alternations of asexual microspheric generations with sexual megalospheric generations.

'''"Employment"''' is a [[science fiction]] story by American writer [[L. Sprague de Camp]], pioneering the concept of [[de-extinction]]. It was first published in the magazine ''[[Analog Science Fiction and Fact|Astounding Science-Fiction]]'' for May, 1939.&lt;ref name="laughlin"&gt;Laughlin, Charlotte, and Levack, Daniel J. H. ''De Camp: An L. Sprague de Camp Bibliography''. San Francisco, Underwood/Miller, 1983, page 155.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="isfdb1"&gt;{{isfdb title|id=45281|title=Employment}}&lt;/ref&gt; The story appeared under the pseudonym Lyman R. Lyon (the name of his maternal great-grandfather) as the magazine's policy did not allow the name of any author to be repeated on the same contents page, and de Camp had another piece in the same issue under his actual name (part one of his article "Design for Life").&lt;ref name="laughlin"/&gt;&lt;ref name="isfdb1"/&gt;&lt;ref name=contento&gt;[http://www.philsp.com/homeville/isfac/t11.htm#A243 Index to Science Fiction Anthologies and Collections]&lt;/ref&gt; It first appeared in book form in the anthology ''[[Imagination Unlimited]]'' ([[Farrar Strauss and Young]], 1952).&lt;ref name="laughlin"/&gt;&lt;ref name="isfdb1"/&gt;  It later appeared in the anthologies ''[[Imagination Unlimited|Men of Space and Time]]'' (The Bodley Head, 1953),&lt;ref name="isfdb1"/&gt; and ''[[Science Fiction Inventions]]'' ([[Lancer Books]], 1967),&lt;ref name="laughlin"/&gt;&lt;ref name="isfdb1"/&gt; as well as the de Camp collection ''[[The Best of L. Sprague de Camp]]'' ([[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday]], 1978). It was credited to de Camp's real name in all publications subsequent to its first appearance. The story has been translated into [[German language|German]].&lt;ref name="laughlin"/&gt;&lt;ref name="isfdb1"/&gt;

== Plot summary ==
The story is set in the then-future era of the late 1950s, and is presented in the form of a letter from the protagonist, geologist Kenneth Staples, to a prospective employer, explaining why he desires to leave his present job.

Staples has been working for paleontologist and inventor Gilmore Platt, whose stereoscopic prospecting device can locate and reveal buried fossils in full detail. From an archeological colleague, Dr. Wilhelmi of Zurich, Platt gets the idea of using an electrolytic bath to restore the specimens he has been retrieving to their original condition, just as the archaeologist can do with corroded bronzes whose atoms have partly dissipated into the surrounding soil. After much experimentation, Platt and Staples succeed in restoring complete animals, hair and all, from fossil skeletons and the matrices of rock in which they are embedded. First they reconstruct an extinct [[Dire wolf|Canis dirus]] (dire wolf), reviving it by applying an electric starter to its heart. They repeat the process with an [[Arctodus|Arctotherium]] (short-faced bear), which they are unable to revive and is mounted in the [[American Museum of Natural History]], [[Stenomylus|Stenomylus hitchcocki]] (an ancestral camel), [[Gomphotherium|Trilophodon]] (a primitive [[proboscidea]]n), and [[Ischyrocyon|Dinocyon gidleyi]] (a bear-dog).

They hire Elias, a former circus man, to manage their growing zoo, which they house in a concrete barn with a row of cages down one side. Staples has a close shave when the Dinocyon escapes its cage in an attempt to prey on the Stenomylus and sees him as an adequate substitute. Platt and Elias come to his rescue, the former with a gun and the latter with a stick of dynamite. It takes the dynamite to do it. Platt then calmly revivifies the bear dog again, but incarcerates it in a stronger cage! It is later sold to the [[Philadelphia Zoo]]. It is replaced with a [[Daeodon|Dinohyus]] (a piglike animal the size of a buffalo).

News of the sale attracts a Mr. Nively, representing the Marco Polo Company, a membership corporation consisting of the whole country's wild animal importers and dealers. His clients want to buy out Platt's discovery, as the resurrection of prehistoric creatures has the potential to ruin the market for present-day animals, which they control. After Platt rejects a number of offers Nively resorts to threats, and is kicked out.

Meanwhile, Platt and Staples recreate their biggest animal yet, a specimen of [[Columbian mammoth|Parelephas jeffersonii]] (Jeffersonian mammoth), which they name Tecumtha after the historical [[Tecumseh|Shawnee chief]]. They also take on a new man, Jake, to assist Elias and help protect their menagerie against Nively. The precaution is well taken, but inadequate. Nively reappears early one morning and attempts to shoot Tecumtha. Enraged, the mammoth takes off after Nively, who tries to escape on Elias's bicycle. Staples, still in his pajamas, pursues both by truck. He eventually finds them in a nearby town square, with Nively perched atop an equestrian statue of [[Philip Sheridan|General Sheridan]] while Tecumtha prowls about its base. When the mammoth pushes over the statue Nively transfers to a nearby tree. On Staples's advice, he then moves to the top of the truck cab to help lure Tecumtha up into the truck bed. With the animal secured, Staples extorts Nively's clothing from him and lets the villain go, only to get into a dispute with local police, who want to kill the creature as a dangerous wild animal.  Rather than permit this, Staples drives off.

After shaking pursuit he calls Platt, who tells him the police have their lab staked out against his return. Accordingly, Platt suggests he drive to [[Chicago]] and sell Tecumtha to the [[Brookfield Zoo|zoo]] there before returning. Unfortunately, Dr. Traphagen at the zoo assumes Staples a madman on hearing his story, particularly since he can't even confirm his own identity, the only identification he can produce being Nively's. Led away by the men in the white suits, he calls to Tecumtha, whose trumpeting finally convinces Traphagen of his veracity. The sale is completed, and Tecumtha saved.

Afterwards, Platt hires more guards and has his compound properly fenced. He begins to recreate more animals, including a [[American Mastodon|Mastodon americanus]] for the [[Bronx Zoo]] in [[New York City|New York]]. He hires another paleontologist as an additional assistant and with him starts happily digging dinosaurs in [[Wyoming]]. Staples learns the two have found a complete [[Tyrannosaurus|Tyrannosaurus Rex]] skeleton, and in light of his experiences so far decides it's time to "clear out while I'm still in one piece."

==Relation to other works==
The plot feature of a disaffected businessman's designs on a recovered mammoth is echoed in de Camp's later [[Rivers of Time|Reginald Rivers]] time travel story "The Mislaid Mastodon" (1993).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8218">In [[futures studies]], especially in Europe, the term "'''foresight'''" has become widely used to describe activities such as:
* [[critical thinking]] concerning long-term developments,
* [[debate]] and for some futurists who are normative and focus on action driven by their values who may be concerned with effort to create wider [[participatory democracy]]. Foresight is a set of competencies and not a value system, however. 
* shaping the future, especially by influencing [[public policy]].

In the last decade, scenario methods, for example, have become widely used in some European countries in policy-making.&lt;ref name="vanSteenberg-2008"&gt;van Steenbergen, Bart: Scenarios As a Powerful Tool for Public Policy. As presented at the Prague Workshop on Futures Studies Methodology, October 2005, http://ceses.cuni.cz/english/051019.php. To be published in the proceedings.&lt;/ref&gt; The FORSOCIETY network brings together national Foresight teams from most European countries, and the European Foresight Monitoring Project is collating material on Foresight activities around the world.  In addition, foresight methods are being used more and more in [[regional planning]] and decision –making (“regional foresight”). Several non-European think-tanks like [[Strategic Foresight Group]] are also engaged in foresight studies.

The foresight of futures studies is also known as strategic foresight. this foresight used by and describing professional futurists trained in Master's programs is the research-driven practice of exploring expected and alternative futures and guiding futures to inform strategy. Foresight includes understanding the relevant recent past; scanning to collect insight about present, futuring to describe the understood future including trend research; environment research to explore possible trend breaks from developments on the fringe and other divergencies that may lead to alternative futures; visioning to define preferred future states; designing strategies to craft this future; and adapting the present forces to implement this plan. There is notable but not complete overlap between foresight and strategic planning, change management, forecasting, and design thinking.

At the same time, the use of foresight for companies (“[[corporate foresight]]”) is becoming more professional and widespread &lt;ref name="ratcliffe-2005"&gt;Ratcliffe, John: Challenges for Corporate Foresight: Towards Strategic Prospective Through [[Scenario planning|Scenario Thinking]] (presented at the conference “Foresight Management in Corporations and Public Organizations”, http://www.tukkk.fi/tutu/conference2005, Helsinki 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="daheim-uerz-2008"&gt;C. Daheim and G.

Hines &amp; J. Gold, “An organizational futurist role for integrating foresight into corporations,” Technological Forecasting and Social Change, Available online 2 May 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Corporate foresight is used to support strategic management, identify new business fields&lt;ref name="rohrbeck-2010"&gt;Rohrbeck, Rene (2010) ''Corporate Foresight: Towards a Maturity Model for the Future Orientation of a Firm'', Springer Series: Contributions to Management Science, Heidelberg and New York, {{ISBN|978-3-7908-2625-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="rohrbeck-et-al-2009"&gt;Rohrbeck, R., S. Mahdjour, S. Knab, T. Frese (2009) [http://ssrn.com/abstract=1470050 Benchmarking Report - Strategic Foresight in Multinational Companies] Report of the European Corporate Foresight Group: [[Berlin|Berlin, Germany]]&lt;/ref&gt; and increase the innovation capacity of a firm.&lt;ref name="rohrbeck-gemuenden-2010"&gt;Rohrbeck, R. H.G. Gemuenden (2011) [http://ssrn.com/abstract=1618523 Corporate Foresight: Its Three Roles in Enhancing the Innovation Capacity of a Firm"] ''Technological Forecasting and Social Change'', 78(2), 231–243.&lt;/ref&gt;

Foresight is not the same as futures research or [[strategic planning]]. It encompasses a range of approaches that combine the three components mentioned above, which may be recast as:
* '''futures''' (forecasting, forward thinking, prospectives),
* '''planning''' (strategic analysis, priority setting), and
* '''networking''' (participatory, dialogic) tools and orientations.

Much futures research has been rather [[Ivory Tower|ivory tower]] work, but Foresight programmes were designed to influence policy - often R&amp;D policy.  Much technology policy had been very elitist; Foresight attempts to go beyond the "usual suspects" and gather widely distributed intelligence.  These three lines of work were already common in Francophone futures studies going by the name ''la prospective''.  But in the 1990s we began to see what became an explosion of systematic organisation of these methods in large scale TECHNOLOGY FORESIGHT programmes in Europe and more widely.

Foresight thus draws on traditions of work in long-range planning and strategic planning, horizontal policymaking and democratic planning, and participatory futures studies - but was also highly influenced by systemic approaches to innovation studies, science and technology policy, and analysis of "critical technologies".

Many of the methods that are commonly associated with Foresight - [[Delphi method|Delphi]] surveys, scenario workshops, etc. - derive from the futures field.  So does the fact that Foresight is concerned with:

* The '''longer-term''' - futures that are usually at least 10 years away (though there are some exceptions to this, especially in its use in private business).   Since Foresight is action-oriented (the planning link) it will rarely be oriented to perspectives beyond a few decades out (though where decisions like [[Aeronautics|aircraft design]], [[power station]] construction or other major infrastructural decisions are concerned, then the [[planning horizon]] may well be half a century).
* '''Alternative''' futures: it is helpful to examine alternative paths of development, not just what is currently believed to be most likely or business as usual. Often Foresight will construct multiple scenarios.  These may be an interim step on the  way to creating what may be known as positive visions, success scenarios, aspirational futures.  Sometimes alternative scenarios will be a major part of the output of Foresight work, with the decision about what future to build being left to other mechanisms.

In [[folklore]], a '''ghost''' (sometimes known as an '''apparition''', '''haunt''', '''phantom''', '''[[poltergeist]]''', '''shade''', '''specter''' or '''spectre''', '''[[spirit]]''', '''spook''', and '''wraith''') is the [[soul (spirit)|soul]] or [[spirit]] of a dead [[Human|person]] or animal that can appear to the living. In [[ghostlore]], descriptions of ghosts vary widely from an invisible presence to translucent or barely visible wispy shapes, to realistic, lifelike visions. The deliberate attempt to contact the spirit of a deceased person is known as [[necromancy]], or in [[spiritism]] as a ''[[séance]]''.

The belief in the existence of an [[afterlife]], as well as manifestations of the spirits of the dead, is widespread, dating back to [[animism]] or [[ancestor worship]] in pre-literate cultures. Certain religious practices—funeral rites, [[exorcism]]s, and some practices of [[spiritualism]] and [[ritual magic]]—are specifically designed to rest the spirits of the dead. Ghosts are generally described as solitary, human-like essences, though stories of ghostly armies and the ghosts of animals rather than humans have also been recounted.&lt;ref&gt;Hole, pp. 150–163&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==Terminology==
{{Further information|Spirit|Soul|wikt:anima|Genius (mythology)|Geist}}
The English word ''[[:wikt:ghost|ghost]]'' continues [[Old English]] ''[[:wikt:gast#Old English|gāst]]'', from [[Proto-Germanic]] ''[[:wikt:Reconstruction:Proto-Germanic/gaistaz|*gaistaz]]''. It is common to [[West Germanic languages|West Germanic]], but lacking in [[North Germanic languages|North Germanic]] and [[East Germanic languages|East Germanic]] (the equivalent word in [[Gothic language|Gothic]] is ''ahma'', [[Old Norse]] has ''andi'' m., ''önd'' f.). The prior [[Proto-Indo-European]] form was ''{{PIE|*ǵʰéysd-os}}'', from the root '' {{PIE|*ǵʰéysd-}}'' denoting "fury, anger" reflected in Old Norse ''geisa'' "to rage". The Germanic word is recorded as masculine only, but likely continues a neuter ''s''-stem. The original meaning of the Germanic word would thus have been an animating principle of the [[mind]], in particular capable of excitation and fury (compare ''[[óðr]]''). In [[Germanic paganism]], "[[Germanic Mercury]]", and the later [[Odin]], was at the same time the [[conductor of the dead]] and the "lord of fury" leading the [[Wild Hunt]].

Besides denoting the human spirit or soul, both of the living and the deceased, the Old English word is used as a synonym of Latin ''[[spirit]]us'' also in the meaning of "breath" or "blast" from the earliest attestations (9th century). It could also denote any good or evil spirit, such as angels and demons; the [[Anglo-Saxon]] gospel refers to the [[demonic possession]] of Matthew 12:43 as ''se unclæna gast''. Also from the Old English period, the word could denote the spirit of God, viz. the "[[Holy Ghost]]".

The now-prevailing sense of "the soul of a deceased person, spoken of as appearing in a visible form" only emerges in [[Middle English]] (14th century). The modern noun does, however, retain a wider field of application, extending on one hand to "soul", "spirit", "[[vital principle]]", "[[mind]]", or "[[psyche (psychology)|psyche]]", the seat of feeling, thought, and moral judgement; on the other hand used figuratively of any shadowy outline, or fuzzy or unsubstantial image; in optics, photography, and cinematography especially, a flare, secondary image, or spurious signal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ghost|url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/78064|website=Oxford English Dictionary|accessdate=27 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The synonym ''[[:wikt:spook|spook]]'' is a [[Dutch language|Dutch]] loanword, akin to [[Low German]] ''spôk'' (of uncertain etymology); it entered the English language via [[American English]] in the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=spook|url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/187392|website=Oxford English Dictionary|accessdate=27 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mencken, H. L. (1936, repr. 1980). The American Language: An Inquiry into the Development of English in the United States (4th edition). New York: Knopf, p. 108.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Webster's Third New International Dictionary'', Merriam-Webster, ''spook''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Webster's New World College Dictionary'' (4th edition), Wiley, ''spook''.&lt;/ref&gt; Alternative words in modern usage include ''spectre'' (altn. ''specter''; from Latin ''spectrum''), the Scottish ''wraith'' (of obscure origin), ''phantom'' (via French ultimately from Greek ''phantasma'', compare ''[[:wikt:fantasy|fantasy]]'') and ''apparition''. The term ''[[shade (mythology)|shade]]'' in [[classical mythology]] translates Greek σκιά,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0057:entry=ou(=tos οὗτος]. Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon''.&lt;/ref&gt; or Latin ''umbra'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=umbra&amp;fromdoc=Perseus%253Atext%253A1999.04.0059 umbra]. Charlton T. Lewis, Charles Short, ''A Latin Dictionary''&lt;/ref&gt; in reference to the notion of spirits in the [[Greek underworld]]. "Haint" is a synonym for ghost used in regional English of the southern United States,&lt;ref&gt;''Dictionary of American Regional English'', Belknap Press, 1985&lt;/ref&gt; and the "haint tale" is a common feature of southern oral and literary tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Flora, Joseph M.; MacKethan, Lucinda Hardwick and Taylor, Todd W. (2001) ''The Companion to Southern Literature'', [[Louisiana State University Press]], p. 304.&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''[[poltergeist]]'' is a German word, literally a "noisy ghost", for a spirit said to manifest itself by invisibly moving and influencing objects.&lt;ref name="Cohen1984"&gt;{{cite book

''[[:wikt:wraith|Wraith]]'' is a [[Scots language|Scots]] word for ''ghost'', ''spectre'', or ''apparition''. It appeared in Scottish Romanticist literature, and acquired the more general or figurative sense of ''portent'' or ''[[omen]]''. In 18th- to 19th-century Scottish literature, it also applied to aquatic spirits. The word has no commonly accepted etymology; the ''[[OED]]'' notes "of obscure origin" only.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=wraith|url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/230504|website=Oxford English Dictionary|accessdate=27 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; An association with the verb ''[[:wikt:writhe|writhe]]'' was the etymology favored by [[J.

A ''[[revenant]]'' is a deceased person returning from the dead to haunt the living, either as a disembodied ghost or alternatively as an animated ("[[undead]]") corpse. Also related is the concept of a [[fetch (folklore)|fetch]], the visible ghost or spirit of a person yet alive.

===Anthropological context===
{{Further information|Animism|Ancestor worship|Origin of religion|Anthropology of religion}}

A notion of the [[transcendence (religion)|transcendent]], [[supernatural]], or [[numinous]], usually involving entities like ghosts, [[demon]]s, or [[deity|deities]], is a [[cultural universal]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Donald Brown (anthropologist)|Donald Brown]] (1991) ''Human Universals''. Philadelphia, [[Temple University Press]] ([http://condor.depaul.edu/~mfiddler/hyphen/humunivers.htm online summary]).&lt;/ref&gt; In pre-literate [[folk religion]]s, these beliefs are often summarized under [[animism]] and [[ancestor worship]]. Some people believe the ghost or [[spirit]] never leaves Earth until there is no-one left to remember the one who died.&lt;ref name="EncyOccult"&gt;Encyclopedia of Occultism and [[Parapsychology]] edited by [[J. Gordon Melton]], [[Gale Group]], {{ISBN|0-8103-5487-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many cultures, malignant, restless ghosts are distinguished from the more benign spirits involved in ancestor worship.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Cavendish (1994) ''The World of Ghosts and the Supernatural''. Waymark Publications, Basingstoke: 5&lt;/ref&gt;

Ancestor worship typically involves rites intended to prevent [[revenant]]s, [[vengeful spirit]]s of the dead, imagined as starving and envious of the living. Strategies for preventing revenants may either include [[sacrifice]], i.e., giving the dead food and drink to pacify them, or magical banishment of the deceased to force them not to return. Ritual feeding of the dead is performed in traditions like the Chinese [[Ghost Festival]] or the Western [[All Souls' Day]]. Magical banishment of the dead is present in many of the world's [[burial custom]]s. The bodies found in many [[tumuli]] ([[kurgan]]) had been ritually bound before burial,&lt;ref&gt;e.g. in graves of the [[Irish Bronze Age]] [http://www.iol.ie/~sec/sites.htm IOL.ie]&lt;/ref&gt; and the custom of binding the dead persists, for example, in rural [[Anatolia]].&lt;ref&gt;"In the immediate aftermath of a death, the deceased is removed from the bed he died in and placed on the prepared floor, called a ‘comfort bed.' His jaw is bound up and his feet tied together (usually at the big toes)." [https://web.archive.org/web/20110611033740/http://www.kultur.gov.tr/EN/belge/2-16147/eski2yeni.html Kultur.gov.tr] (archive version)&lt;/ref&gt;

Nineteenth-century [[anthropologist]] [[James Frazer]] stated in his classic work, ''[[The Golden Bough]]'', that [[souls]] were seen as the creature within that animated the body.&lt;ref name="GoldenBough"&gt;"If a man lives and moves, it can only be because he has a little man or animal inside, who moves him. The animal inside the animal, the man inside the man, is the soul. And as the activity of an animal or man is explained by the presence of the soul, so the repose of sleep or death is explained by its absence; sleep or trance being the temporary, death being the permanent absence of the soul...

===Ghosts and the afterlife===
{{Further information|Soul|Psyche (psychology)|Underworld|Hungry ghost|Psychopomp}}
{{Further information|Ghost Festival|All Souls' Day|Day of the Dead|Ghost Dance}}
Although the human soul was sometimes symbolically or literally depicted in ancient cultures as a bird or other animal, it appears to have been widely held that the soul was an exact reproduction of the body in every feature, even down to clothing the person wore. This is depicted in artwork from various ancient cultures, including such works as the Egyptian ''[[Book of the Dead]]'', which shows deceased people in the afterlife appearing much as they did before death, including the style of dress.

===Fear of ghosts===
{{main article|Fear of ghosts}}
[[File:Suushi Yurei.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Yūrei]] (Japanese ghost) from the [[Hyakkai Zukan]], ca. 1737]]
While deceased ancestors are [[cultural universal|universally]] regarded as venerable, and often believed to have a continued presence in some form of [[afterlife]], the spirit of a deceased person that persists in the material world (a ghost) is regarded as an unnatural or undesirable state of affairs and the idea of ghosts or [[revenant]]s is associated with a reaction of fear. This is universally the case in pre-modern folk cultures, but fear of ghosts also remains an integral aspect of the modern [[ghost story]], [[Gothic horror]], and other [[horror fiction]] dealing with the supernatural.

===Common attributes===
Another widespread belief concerning ghosts is that they are composed of a misty, airy, or subtle material. [[Anthropology|Anthropologists]] link this idea to early beliefs that ghosts were the person within the person (the person's spirit), most noticeable in ancient cultures as a person's breath, which upon exhaling in colder climates appears visibly as a white mist.&lt;ref name="EncyOccult"/&gt; This belief may have also fostered the metaphorical meaning of "breath" in certain languages, such as the [[Latin]] ''spiritus'' and the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''[[pneuma]]'', which by [[analogy]] became extended to mean the soul. In the [[Bible]], [[God]] is depicted as synthesising [[Adam (Bible)|Adam]], as a living soul, from the dust of the Earth and the breath of God.

In many traditional accounts, ghosts were often thought to be deceased people looking for vengeance ([[vengeful ghost]]s), or imprisoned on earth for bad things they did during life. The appearance of a ghost has often been regarded as an omen or portent of death. Seeing one's own ghostly double or "[[Doppelgänger|fetch]]" is a related omen of death.&lt;ref&gt;Hole, pp. 13–27&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Union Graveyard III.jpg|thumb|Union Cemetery in [[Easton, Connecticut]] is home to the legend of the White Lady.]]
[[White Lady (ghost)|White ladies]] were reported to appear in many rural areas, and supposed to have died tragically or suffered trauma in life. White Lady legends are found around the world. Common to many of them is the theme of losing a child or husband and a sense of purity, as opposed to the [[Lady in Red (ghost)|Lady in Red]] ghost that is mostly attributed to a jilted lover or prostitute. The White Lady ghost is often associated with an individual family line or regarded as a harbinger of death similar to a [[banshee]].

Legends of ghost ships have existed since the 18th century; most notable of these is the ''[[Flying Dutchman]]''. This theme has been used in literature in ''[[The Rime of the Ancient Mariner]]'' by Coleridge.

They are often depicted as being covered in a shroud and/or dragging chains.

===Cultural===
The idea of ghosts can be considered a tradition for certain cultures. Many believe in the spirit world and often try to stay in contact with their loved ones.{{explain|date=December 2017}}

===Locale===
{{See also|Haunted house}}
A place where ghosts are reported is described as [[list of reportedly haunted locations|haunted]], and often seen as being inhabited by [[soul (spirit)|spirits]] of deceased who may have been former residents or were familiar with the property. Supernatural activity inside homes is said to be mainly associated with violent or tragic events in the building's past such as murder, accidental death, or suicide—sometimes in the recent or ancient past. But not all hauntings are at a place of a violent death, or even on violent grounds. Many cultures and religions believe the essence of a being, such as the '[[soul (spirit)|soul]]', continues to exist. Some religious views argue that the 'spirits' of those who have died have not 'passed over' and are trapped inside the property where their memories and energy are strong.

There are many references to [[ghosts in Mesopotamian religions]] – the religions of [[Sumer]], [[Babylon]], [[Assyria]], and other early states in [[Mesopotamia]]. Traces of these beliefs survive in the later [[Abrahamic religion]]s that came to dominate the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Ghosts were thought to be created at time of death, taking on the memory and personality of the dead person. They traveled to the netherworld, where they were assigned a position, and led an existence similar in some ways to that of the living.
Relatives of the dead were expected to make offerings of food and drink to the dead to ease their conditions. If they did not, the ghosts could inflict misfortune and illness on the living. Traditional healing practices ascribed a variety of illnesses to the action of ghosts, while others were caused by gods or demons.&lt;ref name=black&gt;{{cite book

[[File:Akh glyph.svg|thumb|right|upright|Egyptian Akh glyph – The [[Egyptian soul|soul]] and spirit re-united after death]]
There was widespread belief in [[ghosts in ancient Egyptian culture]]
The [[Hebrew Bible]] contains few references to ghosts, associating spiritism with forbidden occult activities cf. [[Deuteronomy]] 18:11. The most notable reference is in the First [[Books of Samuel|Book of Samuel]] (I Samuel 28:3–19 KJV), in which a disguised [[Saul the King|King Saul]] has the [[Witch of Endor]] summon the spirit or ghost of [[Samuel]].

The [[Egyptian soul|soul]] and spirit were believed to exist after death, with the ability to assist or harm the living, and the possibility of a second death. Over a period of more than 2,500 years, Egyptian beliefs about the nature of the afterlife evolved constantly. Many of these beliefs were recorded in [[hieroglyph]] inscriptions, papyrus scrolls and tomb paintings. The Egyptian ''[[Book of the Dead]]'' compiles some of the beliefs from different periods of ancient Egyptian history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Goelet |first= Ogden |title= A Commentary on the Corpus of Literature and Tradition which constitutes the Book of Going Forth By Day |publisher= Chronicle Books |location= San Francisco |year=1998 |pages=139–170}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Classical Antiquity===
{{further information|Shade (mythology)|Magic in the Greco-Roman world}}

====Archaic and Classical Greece====
[[File:Klytaimnestra Erinyes Louvre Cp710.jpg|thumb|Apulian red-figure [[bell krater]] depicting the ghost of [[Clytemnestra]] waking the [[Erinyes]], circa 380-370 BC]]

Ghosts appeared in [[Homer]]'s ''[[Odyssey]]'' and ''[[Iliad]]'', in which they were described as vanishing "as a vapor, gibbering and whining into the earth". Homer's ghosts had little interaction with the world of the living. Periodically they were called upon to provide advice or prophecy, but they do not appear to be particularly feared. Ghosts in the classical world often appeared in the form of vapor or smoke, but at other times they were described as being substantial, appearing as they had been at the time of death, complete with the wounds that killed them.&lt;ref&gt;Finucane, pp. 4, 16&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 5th century BC, [[classical Greece|classical Greek]] ghosts had become haunting, frightening creatures who could work to either good or evil purposes. The spirit of the dead was believed to hover near the resting place of the corpse, and cemeteries were places the living avoided. The dead were to be ritually mourned through public ceremony, sacrifice, and libations, or else they might return to haunt their families. The ancient Greeks held annual feasts to honor and placate the spirits of the dead, to which the family ghosts were invited, and after which they were "firmly invited to leave until the same time next year."&lt;ref&gt;Finucane, pp. 8–11&lt;/ref&gt;

The 5th-century BC play ''[[Oresteia]]'' includes an appearance of the ghost of [[Clytemnestra]], one of the first ghosts to appear in a work of fiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Trousdell|first1=Richard|title=Tragedy and Transformation: The Oresteia of Aeschylus|journal=Jung Journal|volume=2|issue=3|pages=5–38|jstor=10.1525/jung.2008.2.3.5|doi=10.1525/jung.2008.2.3.5|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Roman Empire and Late Antiquity====
[[File:Athenodorus - The Greek Stoic Philosopher Athenodorus Rents a Haunted House.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Athenodoros Cananites|Athenodorus]] and the Ghost'', by [[Henry Justice Ford]], c.1900]]
The [[ancient Rome|ancient Romans]] believed a ghost could be used to exact revenge on an enemy by scratching a curse on a piece of lead or pottery and placing it into a grave.&lt;ref&gt;Finucane, pg 12&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Plutarch]], in the 1st century AD, described the haunting of the baths at [[Chaeronea]] by the ghost of a murdered man. The ghost's loud and frightful groans caused the people of the town to seal up the doors of the building.&lt;ref&gt;Finucane, pg 13&lt;/ref&gt; Another celebrated account of a haunted house from the ancient classical world is given by [[Pliny the Younger]] ([[circa|c.]] 50 AD).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.siu.edu/news/ghosts.html |title=Classical ghost stories |last=Jaehnig |first=K.C. |date=1999-03-11 |publisher= Southern Illinois University |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070908171955/http://www.siu.edu/news/ghosts.html |accessdate=2007-09-19 |archivedate= September 8, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pliny describes the haunting of a house in [[Athens]], which was bought by the [[Stoicism|Stoic]] philosopher [[Athenodorus Cananites|Athenodorus]], who lived about 100 years before Pliny. Knowing that the house was supposedly haunted, Athenodorus intentionally set up his writing desk in the room where the apparition was said to appear and sat there writing until late at night when he was disturbed by a ghost bound in chains. He followed the ghost outside where it indicated a spot on the ground. When Athenodorus later excavated the area, a shackled skeleton was unearthed. The haunting ceased when the skeleton was given a proper reburial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bartleby.com/9/4/1083.html |title=LXXXIII. To Sura |author=Pliny the Younger |website=bartleby.com |accessdate=2007-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The writers [[Plautus]] and [[Lucian]] also wrote stories about haunted houses.

In the [[New Testament]], according to [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]] 24:37–39,&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20150919133530/https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=luke%2024:37-39]&lt;/ref&gt;  following his [[resurrection of Jesus|resurrection]], [[Jesus]] was forced to persuade the [[Twelve Apostles|Disciples]] that he was not a ghost (some versions of the Bible, such as the KJV and NKJV, use the term "spirit"). Similarly, Jesus' followers at first believed he was a ghost (spirit) when they saw him [[Jesus walking on water|walking on water]].

One of the first persons to express disbelief in ghosts was [[Lucian of Samosata]] in the 2nd century AD. In his satirical novel ''[[Lover of Lies|The Lover of Lies]]'' (circa 150 AD), he relates how [[Democritus]] "the learned man from [[Abdera, Thrace|Abdera]] in [[Thrace]]" lived in a tomb outside the [[city gate]]s to prove that cemeteries were not haunted by the spirits of the departed. Lucian relates how he persisted in his disbelief despite [[practical joke]]s perpetrated by "some young men of Abdera" who dressed up in black robes with skull masks to frighten him.&lt;ref&gt;"The Doubter" by Lucian in Roger Lancelyn Green (1970) ''Thirteen Uncanny Tales''. London, Dent: 14–21; and Finucane, pg 26.&lt;/ref&gt; This account by Lucian notes something about the popular classical expectation of how a ghost should look.

In the 5th century AD, the Christian priest [[Constantius of Lyon]] recorded an instance of the recurring theme of the improperly buried dead who come back to haunt the living, and who can only cease their haunting when their bones have been discovered and properly reburied.&lt;ref&gt;F. R. Hoare, ''The Western Fathers'', Sheed &amp; Ward: New York, 1954, pp. 294–5.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Middle Ages===
Ghosts reported in [[Middle Ages|medieval Europe]] tended to fall into two categories: the souls of the dead, or demons. The souls of the dead returned for a specific purpose. Demonic ghosts existed only to torment or tempt the living. The living could tell them apart by demanding their purpose in the name of Jesus Christ. The soul of a dead person would divulge its mission, while a demonic ghost would be banished at the sound of the Holy Name.&lt;ref&gt;Finucane, Ch. 3&lt;/ref&gt;

Most ghosts were souls assigned to [[Purgatory]], condemned for a specific period to atone for their transgressions in life. Their penance was generally related to their sin. For example, the ghost of a man who had been abusive to his servants was condemned to tear off and swallow bits of his own tongue; the ghost of another man, who had neglected to leave his cloak to the poor, was condemned to wear the cloak, now "heavy as a church tower". These ghosts appeared to the living to ask for prayers to end their suffering. Other dead souls returned to urge the living to confess their sins before their own deaths.&lt;ref&gt;Fincucane, pp. 70–77.&lt;/ref&gt;

Medieval European ghosts were more substantial than ghosts described in the [[Victorian era|Victorian age]], and there are accounts of ghosts being wrestled with and physically restrained until a priest could arrive to hear its confession. Some were less solid, and could move through walls. Often they were described as paler and sadder versions of the person they had been while alive, and dressed in tattered gray rags. The vast majority of reported sightings were male.&lt;ref&gt;Finucane, pp. 83–84.&lt;/ref&gt;

There were some reported cases of ghostly armies, fighting battles at night in the forest, or in the remains of an [[Iron Age]] hillfort, as at [[Wandlebury]], near Cambridge, England. Living knights were sometimes challenged to single combat by phantom knights, which vanished when defeated.&lt;ref name="Finucanepg"&gt;Finucane, pg. 79.&lt;/ref&gt;

From the medieval period an apparition of a ghost is recorded from 1211, at the time of the [[Albigensian Crusade]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Mark Gregory Pegg]] (2008) ''A Most Holy War''. [[Oxford University Press]], New York: 3–5, 116–117. {{ISBN|978-0-19-517131-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gervase of Tilbury]], Marshal of [[Arles]], wrote that the image of Guilhem, a boy recently murdered in the forest, appeared in his cousin's home in [[Beaucaire, Gard|Beaucaire]], near [[Avignon]]. This series of "visits" lasted all of the summer. Through his cousin, who spoke for him, the boy allegedly held conversations with anyone who wished, until the local priest requested to speak to the boy directly, leading to an extended disquisition on theology. The boy narrated the trauma of death and the unhappiness of his fellow souls in [[Purgatory]], and reported that God was most pleased with the ongoing Crusade against the [[Cathar]] heretics, launched three years earlier. The time of the Albigensian Crusade in southern France was marked by intense and prolonged warfare, this constant bloodshed and dislocation of populations being the context for these reported visits by the murdered boy.

Haunted houses are featured in the 9th-century ''[[One Thousand and One Nights|Arabian Nights]]'' (such as the tale of ''[[list of stories within One Thousand and One Nights|Ali the Cairene and the Haunted House in Baghdad]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Arabian Nights and Orientalism: Perspectives from East &amp; West |last=Yuriko Yamanaka |first=Tetsuo Nishio |publisher=[[I.B. Tauris]] |year=2006 |isbn=978-1-85043-768-0 |page=83}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===European Renaissance to Romanticism===
[[File:File-Hamlet, Prince of Demark Act I Scene IV.png|thumb|right|"[[Hamlet]] and his father's ghost" by [[Henry Fuseli]] (1796 drawing). The ghost is wearing stylized [[plate armor]] in 17th-century style, including a [[morion (helmet)|morion]] type helmet and [[tassets]]. Depicting ghosts as wearing armor, to suggest a sense of antiquity, was common in [[Elizabethan theater]].]]
[[Renaissance magic]] took a revived interest in the [[occult]], including [[necromancy]]. In the era of the Reformation and Counter Reformation, there was frequently a backlash against unwholesome interest in the dark arts, typified by writers such as [[Thomas Erastus]].&lt;ref&gt;Walker, D.P. (1958) ''Spiritual and Demonic Magic from Ficino to Campanella.'' London: Warburg Institute, passim.&lt;/ref&gt; The Swiss Reformed pastor [[Ludwig Lavater]] supplied one of the most frequently reprinted books of the period with his ''Of Ghosts and Spirits Walking By Night.''&lt;ref&gt;Original German edition: ''Von Gespänsten ..., kurtzer und einfaltiger bericht,'' Zürich, 1569 [VD16 L 834]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Child Ballads|Child Ballad]] "[[Sweet William's Ghost]]" (1868) recounts the story of a ghost returning to his fiancée begging her to free him from his promise to marry her. He cannot marry her because he is dead but her refusal would mean his damnation. This reflects a popular British belief that the dead haunted their lovers if they took up with a new love without some formal release.&lt;ref&gt;[[Francis James Child|Child, Francis James]], ''The English and Scottish Popular Ballads'', v. 2, p. 227, Dover Publications, New York 1965&lt;/ref&gt; "[[The Unquiet Grave]]" expresses a belief even more widespread, found in various locations over Europe: ghosts can stem from the excessive grief of the living, whose mourning interferes with the dead's peaceful rest.&lt;ref&gt;Child, Francis James, ''The English and Scottish Popular Ballads'', v 2, p 234, Dover Publications, New York 1965&lt;/ref&gt; In many folktales from around the world, the hero arranges for the burial of a dead man. Soon after, he gains a companion who aids him and, in the end, the hero's companion reveals that he is in fact the [[Grateful dead (folklore)|dead man]].&lt;ref name="encybrit"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/242238/grateful-dead#23476.hook|title=Grateful dead|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica Online|year=2007 |accessdate=2007-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instances of this include the Italian [[fairy tale]] "[[Fair Brow]]" and the Swedish "[[The Bird 'Grip']]".

Spiritism, or French spiritualism, is based on the five books of the [[Spiritist Codification]] written by French educator Hypolite Léon Denizard Rivail under the [[pseudonym]] [[Allan Kardec]] reporting [[séance]]s in which he observed a series of phenomena that he attributed to incorporeal intelligence ([[spirit]]s). His assumption of spirit communication was validated by many contemporaries, among them many scientists and philosophers who attended séances and studied the phenomena. His work was later extended by writers like [[Leon Denis]], [[Arthur Conan Doyle]], [[Camille Flammarion]], [[Ernesto Bozzano]], [[Chico Xavier]], Divaldo Pereira Franco, Waldo Vieira, [[Johannes Greber]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seanet.com/~raines/greber.html Johannes Greber] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090316063452/http://www.seanet.com/~raines/greber.html |date=2009-03-16 }} Seanet.com Retrieved on 2013-03-21&lt;/ref&gt; and others.

The physician [[John Ferriar]] wrote "An Essay Towards a Theory of Apparitions" in 1813 in which he argued that sightings of ghosts were the result of [[optical illusion]]s. Later the French physician [[Alexandre Jacques François Brière de Boismont]] published ''On Hallucinations: Or, the Rational History of Apparitions, Dreams, Ecstasy, Magnetism, and Somnambulism'' in 1845 in which he claimed sightings of ghosts were the result of [[hallucinations]].&lt;ref&gt;McCorristine, Shane ''Spectres of the Self: Thinking About Ghosts and Ghost-Seeing in England, 1750–1920'' 2010, {{ISBN|1139788825}} pp. 44–56&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gelder, Ken ''The horror reader'' 2000, {{ISBN|0415213568}} pp. 43–44&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Joe Nickell]] of the [[Committee for Skeptical Inquiry]] wrote that there was no credible [[scientific evidence]] that any location was inhabited by spirits of the dead.&lt;ref name = "CSICOP"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csicop.org/si/show/haunted_inns_tales_of_spectral_guest |title=Haunted Inns Tales of Spectral Guests |last=Nickell |first=Joe |authorlink=Joe Nickell|date=Sep–Oct 2000 |publisher=[[Committee for Skeptical Inquiry]] |accessdate=2009-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Limitations of [[perception|human perception]] and ordinary physical explanations can account for ghost sightings; for example, [[air pressure]] changes in a home causing doors to slam, humidity changes causing boards to creak, [[Failure of electronic components|condensation in electrical connections]]  causing intermittent behavior, or lights from a passing car reflected through a window at night. [[Pareidolia]], an innate tendency to recognize patterns in random perceptions, is what some skeptics believe causes people to believe that they have 'seen ghosts'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://skepdic.com/pareidol.html |title=pareidolia |last=Carroll |first=Robert Todd |date= June 2001|website=skepdic.com |accessdate=2007-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reports of ghosts "seen out of the corner of the eye" may be accounted for by the sensitivity of human [[peripheral vision]].

: "Once the idea of a ghost appears in a household ... no longer is an object merely mislaid .... There gets to be a dynamic in a place where the idea that it's haunted takes on a life of its own. One-of-a-kind quirks that could never be repeated all become further evidence of the haunting."&lt;/ref&gt; Nickell further states, "science cannot substantiate the existence of a 'life energy' that could survive death without dissipating or function at all without a brain... why would... clothes survive?'" He asks, if ghosts glide, then why do people claim to hear them with "heavy footfalls"? Nickell says that ghosts act the same way as "dreams, memories, and imaginings, because they too are mental creations. They are evidence - not of another world, but of this real and natural one."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nickell|first1=Joe|authorlink=Joe Nickell|title=Hawking 'Ghosts' in Old Louisville|journal=Skeptical Inquirer|date=2018|volume=42|issue=2|pages=26–29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Benjamin Radford]] from the [[Committee for Skeptical Inquiry]] and author of the 2017 book ''Investigating Ghosts: The Scientific Search for Spirits'' writes that "ghost hunting is the world's most popular paranormal pursuit" yet, to date ghost hunters can't agree on what a ghost is, or offer proof that they exist "it's all speculation and guesswork". He writes that it would be "useful and important to distinguish between types of spirits and apparitions.

According to research in [[anomalistic psychology]] visions of ghosts may arise from [[hypnagogia|hypnagogic]] hallucinations ("waking dreams" experienced in the transitional states to and from [[sleep]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Klemperer, Frances|year=1992|title=Ghosts, Visions, and Voices: Sometimes Simply Perceptual Mistakes|journal= British Medical Journal |volume= 305|issue=6868 |pages=1518–1519|jstor=29717993|doi=10.1136/bmj.305.6868.1518|pmid=1286367|pmc=1884722}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a study of two experiments into alleged [[hauntings]] (Wiseman ''et al''. 2003) came to the conclusion "that people consistently report unusual experiences in 'haunted' areas because of environmental factors, which may differ across locations."

Some researchers, such as [[Michael Persinger]] of [[Laurentian University]], Canada, have speculated that changes in [[geomagnetic]] fields (created, e.g., by tectonic stresses in the Earth's crust or [[solar variation|solar activity]]) could stimulate the brain's [[temporal lobe]]s and produce many of the experiences associated with hauntings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.richardwiseman.com/research/ghosts.html Richard Wiseman].

The [[Hebrew]] [[Torah]] and the [[Bible]] contain a few references to ghosts, associating [[spiritism]] with forbidden [[occult]] activities.&lt;ref&gt;[[Deuteronomy]] 18:11&lt;/ref&gt; The most notable reference is in the [[Books of Samuel|First Book of Samuel]],&lt;ref&gt;I Samuel 28:3–19 KJV&lt;/ref&gt; in which a disguised [[Saul the King|King Saul]] has the [[Witch of Endor]] summon the spirit or ghost of [[Samuel]]. In the [[New Testament]], [[Jesus]] has to persuade the [[Twelve Apostles|Disciples]] that he is not a ghost following the [[resurrection of Jesus|resurrection]], [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]] 24:37–39 (some versions of the Bible, such as the KJV and NKJV, use the term "spirit").

Furthermore, they teach that in accordance with ([[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 2:7, [[Ecclesiastes]] 12:7), there are only two components to a "soul", neither of which survives death, with each returning to its respective source.

[[Christadelphian]]s and [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] reject the view of a living, conscious soul after death.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20030408015940/http://christadelphia.org/reject.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

Belief in ghosts in [[European folklore]] is characterized by the recurring fear of "returning" or ''[[revenant]]'' deceased who may harm the living. This includes the Scandinavian ''[[gjenganger]]'', the Romanian ''[[strigoi]]'', the Serbian ''[[vampire|vampir]]'', the Greek ''[[vrykolakas]]'', etc. In Scandinavian and Finnish tradition, ghosts appear in corporeal form, and their supernatural nature is given away by behavior rather than appearance. In fact, in many stories they are first mistaken for the living. They may be mute, appear and disappear suddenly, or leave no footprints or other traces.

[[English folklore]] is particularly notable for its numerous [[reportedly haunted locations in the United Kingdom|haunted locations]].

Belief in the [[soul]] and an [[afterlife]] remained near universal until the emergence of [[atheism]] in the 18th century.{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}} In the 19th century, [[spiritism]] resurrected "belief in ghosts" as the object of systematic inquiry, and popular opinion in [[Western culture]] remains divided.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Chambers (2006) ''The Cock Lane Ghost''.

{{Main article|Bhoot (ghost)}}
A ''bhoot'' or ''bhut'' ({{lang|hi|भूत}}, {{lang|gu|ભૂત}}, or {{lang|ur|بهوت}}) is a supernatural creature, usually the ghost of a deceased person, in the popular culture, literature and some ancient texts of the [[Indian subcontinent]]. Interpretations of how ''bhoot''s come into existence vary by region and community, but they are usually considered to be perturbed and restless due to some factor that prevents them from moving on (to [[reincarnation|transmigration]], non-being, [[nirvana]], or heaven or hell, depending on tradition). This could be a violent death, unsettled matters in their lives, or simply the failure of their survivors to perform proper funerals.&lt;ref name="ref88muliq"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Students' Britannica India, Volumes 1–5 |editor= Hoiberg, Dale |author= Ramchandani, Indu |publisher=Popular Prakashan, 2000 |year=2000 |isbn=978-0-85229-760-5 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Kpd9lLY_0-IC |quote=Bhut also spelt bhoot, in Hindu mythology, a restless ghost.

In Central and Northern India, ''Aojha'' [[spirit guide]]s play a central role.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} It duly happens when in the night someone sleeps and decorates something on the wall, and they say that if one sees the spirit the next thing in the morning he will become a spirit too, and that to a ''skondho kata'', which means a spirit without a head and the soul of the body will remain the dark with the dark lord from the spirits who reside in the body of every human in Central and Northern India. It is also believed that if someone calls one from behind, never turn back and see because the spirit may catch the human to make it a spirit.
Other types of spirits in Hindu Mythology include [[Baital]], an evil spirit who haunts cemeteries and takes demonic possession of corpses, and [[Pishacha]], a type of flesh-eating demon.

====Bengal and East India====
{{Main article|Ghosts in Bengali culture|l1=Ghosts in Bengali Culture}}

There are many kinds of ghosts and similar supernatural entities that frequently come up in [[Bengali culture]], its folklores and form an important part in Bengali peoples' socio-cultural beliefs and superstitions. It is believed that the spirits of those who cannot find peace in the afterlife or die unnatural deaths remain on Earth. The common word for ghosts in Bengali is ''[[Bhoot (ghost)|bhoot]]'' or ''bhut'' ({{lang-bn|ভূত}}). This word has an alternative meaning: 'past' in Bengali. Also the word ''Pret'' (Sanskrit) is used in Bengali to mean ghost. In Bengal, ghosts are believed to be the spirit after death of an unsatisfied human being or a soul of a person who dies in unnatural or abnormal circumstances (like murder, suicide or accident). Even it is believed that other animals and creatures can also be turned into ghost after their death.

Ghosts in [[Thailand]] are part of local [[Thai folklore|folklore]] and have now become part of the popular culture of the country. [[Phraya Anuman Rajadhon]] was the first Thai scholar who seriously studied Thai folk beliefs and took notes on the [[nocturnal]] village spirits of Thailand.

====Tibet====
{{Main article|Ghosts in Tibetan culture}}
There is widespread belief in ghosts in Tibetan culture. Ghosts are explicitly recognized in the [[Tibetan Buddhist]] religion as they were in [[history of Buddhism in India|Indian Buddhism]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Conze |first=Edward |title=A Short History of Buddhism |edition=2|year=1993 |publisher=Oneworld |location=Oxford}}&lt;/ref&gt; occupying a distinct but overlapping world to the human one, and feature in many traditional legends. When a human dies, after a period of uncertainty they may enter the ghost world. A [[hungry ghost]] ([[Standard Tibetan|Tibetan]]: {{lang|bo-Latn|yidag}}, {{lang|bo-Latn|yi-dvags}}; {{lang-sa|प्रेत|transl=preta}}) has a tiny throat and huge stomach, and so can never be satisfied. Ghosts may be killed with a ritual dagger or caught in a spirit trap and burnt, thus releasing them to be reborn. Ghosts may also be exorcised, and an annual festival is held throughout Tibet for this purpose. Some say that [[Dorje Shugden]], the ghost of a powerful 17th-century monk, is a deity, but the [[Dalai Lama]] asserts that he is an evil spirit, which has caused a split in the Tibetan exile community.

There are many [[Malay ghost myths]], remnants of old animist beliefs that have been shaped by later Hindu, Buddhist, and Muslim influences in the modern states of [[Indonesia]], [[Malaysia]], and [[Brunei]]. Some ghost concepts such as the female vampires [[Pontianak (folklore)|Pontianak]] and [[Penanggalan]] are shared throughout the region.
Ghosts are a popular theme in modern Malaysian and Indonesian films.
There are also many references to [[ghosts in Filipino culture]], ranging from ancient legendary creatures such as the [[Manananggal]] and [[Tiyanak]] to more modern urban legends and horror films. The beliefs, legends and stories are as diverse as the people of the [[Philippines]].

There was widespread belief in [[ghosts in Polynesian culture]], some of which persists today.
After death, a person's ghost normally traveled to the sky world or the underworld, but some could stay on earth. In many [[Polynesian culture|Polynesian]] legends, ghosts were often actively involved in the affairs of the living. Ghosts might also cause sickness or even invade the body of ordinary people, to be driven out through strong medicines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Hawaiian Legends of Ghosts and Ghost-Gods |last=Westervelt |first=William Drake |publisher=Forgotten Books |year=1985 |isbn=978-1-60506-964-7 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=hVd46sXgkSAC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ghosts take many forms, depending on how the person died, and are often harmful. Many Chinese ghost beliefs have been accepted by neighboring cultures, notably Japan and southeast Asia. Ghost beliefs are closely associated with traditional Chinese religion based on ancestor worship, many of which were incorporated in [[Taoism]]. Later beliefs were influenced by [[Buddhism]], and in turn influenced and created uniquely Chinese Buddhist beliefs.

Many Chinese today believe it possible to contact the spirits of their ancestors through a medium, and that ancestors can help descendants if properly respected and rewarded. The annual [[ghost festival]] is celebrated by Chinese around the world. On this day, ghosts and [[spiritual being|spirits]], including those of the deceased ancestors, come out from the [[underworld|lower realm]]. Ghosts are described in classical Chinese texts as well as modern literature and films.

A recent article in the China Post stated that nearly eighty-seven percent of Chinese office workers believe in ghosts, and some fifty-two percent of workers will wear hand art, necklaces, crosses, or even place a crystal ball on their desks to keep ghosts at bay, according to the poll.

{{Nihongo|'''Yūrei'''|[[wikt:幽霊|幽霊]]}} are figures in [[Japanese folklore]], analogous to Western legends of ghosts. The name consists of two [[kanji]], [[wikt:幽|幽]] (''yū''), meaning "faint" or "dim", and [[wikt:霊|霊]] (''rei''), meaning "soul" or "spirit". Alternative names include 亡霊 (Bōrei) meaning ruined or departed spirit, 死霊 (Shiryō) meaning dead spirit, or the more encompassing 妖怪 ([[Yōkai]]) or お化け ([[Obake]]).

Like their [[Chinese folklore|Chinese]] and Western counterparts, they are thought to be [[soul (spirit)|spirits]] kept from a peaceful [[afterlife]].

Ghosts are prominent in story-telling of various nations. The [[ghost story]] is ubiquitous across all cultures from oral [[folklore|folktales]] to works of literature. While ghost stories are often explicitly meant to be scary, they have been written to serve all sorts of purposes, from comedy to [[morality tale]]s. Ghosts often appear in the narrative as sentinels or [[prophet]]s of things to come. Belief in ghosts is found in all cultures around the world, and thus ghost stories may be passed down orally or in written form.{{Sfn|Darrell Schweitzer|2005|p=338-340}}

Spirits of the dead appear in literature as early as [[Homer]]'s ''[[Odyssey]]'', which features a journey to the [[underworld]] and the hero encountering the ghosts of the dead,{{Sfn|Darrell Schweitzer|2005|p=338-340}} and the [[Old Testament]], in which the [[Witch of Endor]] summons the spirit of the prophet [[Samuel]].{{Sfn|Darrell Schweitzer|2005|p=338-340}}

===Renaissance to Romanticism (1500 to 1840)===

One of the more recognizable ghosts in [[English literature]] is the [[King Hamlet|shade of Hamlet's murdered father]] in Shakespeare's ''The Tragical History of [[Hamlet, Prince of Denmark]]''. In ''Hamlet'', it is the ghost who demands that [[Prince Hamlet]] investigate his "murder most foul" and seek revenge upon his usurping uncle, [[King Claudius]].

In [[English Renaissance theater]], ghosts were often depicted in the garb of the living and even in armor, as with the ghost of Hamlet's father. Armor, being out-of-date by the time of the Renaissance, gave the stage ghost a sense of antiquity.&lt;ref&gt;Ann Jones &amp; Peter Stallybrass, ''Renaissance Clothing and the Materials of Memory'', Cambridge University Press, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; But the sheeted ghost began to gain ground on stage in the 19th century because an armored ghost could not satisfactorily convey the requisite spookiness: it clanked and creaked, and had to be moved about by complicated pulley systems or elevators. These clanking ghosts being hoisted about the stage became objects of ridicule as they became clichéd stage elements. Ann Jones and Peter Stallybrass, in ''Renaissance Clothing and the Materials of Memory'', point out, "In fact, it is as laughter increasingly threatens the Ghost that he starts to be staged not in armor but in some form of 'spirit drapery'."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Holland|first1=Peter|title=Shakespeare Survey: Volume 58, Writing about Shakespeare|date=2005|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "classic" ghost story arose during the Victorian period, and included authors such as [[M. R. James]], [[Sheridan Le Fanu]], [[Violet Hunt]], and [[Henry James]]. Classic ghost stories were influenced by the gothic fiction tradition, and contain elements of folklore and psychology. M. R. James summed up the essential elements of a ghost story as, "Malevolence and terror, the glare of evil faces, ‘the stony grin of unearthly malice', pursuing forms in darkness, and 'long-drawn, distant screams', are all in place, and so is a modicum of blood, shed with deliberation and carefully husbanded...".&lt;ref&gt;James, M. R. "Some Remarks on Ghost Stories", The Bookman, December 1929.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the key early appearances by ghosts was ''[[The Castle of Otranto]]'' by [[Horace Walpole]] in 1764, considered to be the first [[gothic novel]].{{Sfn|Darrell Schweitzer|2005|p=338-340}}&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-30313775 "The Castle of Otranto: The creepy tale that launched gothic fiction"]. BBC. Retrieved October 7, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Newman, pg. 135"&gt;Newman, Kim (ed.) ''BFI Companion to Horror'', Cassell: London, 1996, {{ISBN|030433216X}}, p. 135.&lt;/ref&gt;

Famous literary apparitions from this period are the ghosts of ''[[A Christmas Carol]]'', in which [[Ebenezer Scrooge]] is helped to see the error of his ways by the ghost of his former colleague [[Jacob Marley]], and the ghosts of Christmas Past, Christmas Present, and Christmas Yet to Come.

===Modern era (1920 to 1970)===
[[File:Brown lady.jpg|left|upright|thumb|''[[Brown Lady of Raynham Hall]]'', a claimed ghost photograph by Captain Hubert C. Provand. First published in ''[[Country Life (magazine)|Country Life]]'' magazine, 1936]]
Professional parapsychologists and "ghosts hunters", such as [[Harry Price]], active in the 1920s and 1930s, and [[Peter Underwood (parapsychologist)|Peter Underwood]], active in the 1940s and 1950s, published accounts of their experiences with ostensibly true ghost stories such as Price's ''The Most Haunted House in England'', and Underwood's ''Ghosts of Borley'' (both recounting experiences at [[Borley Rectory]]). The writer [[Frank Edwards (writer and broadcaster)|Frank Edwards]] delved into ghost stories in his books of his, like "Stranger than Science."

Children's benevolent ghost stories became popular, such as [[Casper the Friendly Ghost]], created in the 1930s and appearing in comics, [[animated cartoon]]s, and eventually a 1995 feature film.

With the advent of motion pictures and television, screen depictions of ghosts became common, and spanned a variety of genres; the works of Shakespeare, Dickens and Wilde have all been made into cinematic versions. Novel-length tales have been difficult to adapt to cinema, although that of ''[[The Haunting of Hill House]]'' to ''[[The Haunting (1963 film)|The Haunting]]'' in 1963 is an exception.&lt;ref name="Newman, pg. 135"/&gt;

Sentimental depictions during this period were more popular in cinema than horror, and include the 1947 film ''[[The Ghost and Mrs. Muir]]'', which was later adapted to television with a successful 1968–70 [[The Ghost &amp; Mrs. Muir (TV series)|TV series]].&lt;ref name="Newman, pg. 135" /&gt; Genuine [[psychological horror]] films from this period include 1944's ''[[The Uninvited (1944 film)|The Uninvited]]'', and 1945's ''[[Dead of Night]]''.

===Post-modern (1970–present)===
{{see also|List of ghost films}}
The 1970s saw screen depictions of ghosts diverge into distinct genres of the romantic and horror. A common theme in the romantic genre from this period is the ghost as a benign guide or messenger, often with unfinished business, such as 1989's ''[[Field of Dreams]]'', the 1990 film ''[[Ghost (1990 film)|Ghost]]'', and the 1993 comedy ''[[Heart and Souls]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CE3DE1339F93BA3575BC0A965958260|title=FILM; When It Comes to the Hereafter, Romance and Sentiment Rule|last=Chanko|first=Kenneth M.|date=August 8, 1993|website=The New York Times|accessdate=2009-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the horror genre, 1980's ''[[The Fog]]'', and the ''[[A Nightmare on Elm Street (franchise)|A Nightmare on Elm Street]]'' series of films from the 1980s and 1990s are notable examples of the trend for the merging of ghost stories with scenes of physical violence.&lt;ref name="Newman, pg. 135"/&gt;

Popularised in such films as the 1984 comedy ''[[Ghostbusters]]'', [[ghost hunting]] became a hobby for many who formed ghost hunting societies to explore reportedly haunted places. The ghost hunting theme has been featured in [[Reality television|reality television series]], such as ''[[Ghost Adventures]]'', ''[[Ghosthunters (TV series)|Ghost Hunters]]'', ''[[Ghost Hunters International]]'', ''[[Ghost Lab]]'', ''[[Most Haunted]]'', and ''[[A Haunting]]''. It is also represented in children's television by such programs as ''[[The Ghost Hunter (TV series)|The Ghost Hunter]]'' and ''[[Ghost Trackers]]''. Ghost hunting also gave rise to multiple guidebooks to haunted locations, and ghost hunting "how-to" manuals.

The 1990s saw a return to classic "gothic" ghosts, whose dangers were more psychological than physical. Examples of films from this period include 1999's ''[[The Sixth Sense]]'' and ''[[The Others (2001 film)|The Others]]''.

[[Asian cinema]] has also produced [[horror film]]s about ghosts, such as the 1998 Japanese film ''[[Ring (film)|Ringu]]'' (remade in the US as ''[[The Ring (2002 film)|The Ring]]'' in 2002), and the Pang brothers' 2002 film ''[[The Eye (2002 film)|The Eye]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E01E1D61330F93BA35755C0A9659C8B63|title=Why Asian Ghost Stories Are the Best |last=Rafferty|first=Terence|date=June 8, 2003|website=The New York Times|accessdate=2009-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Indian ghost movies]] are popular not just in India, but in the Middle East, Africa, South East Asia, and other parts of the world. Some Indian ghost movies such as the comedy / horror film ''[[Chandramukhi]]'' have been commercial successes, dubbed into several languages.&lt;ref name=behind&gt;{{cite web

In fictional television programming, ghosts have been explored in series such as ''[[Supernatural (U.S. TV series)|Supernatural]]'', ''[[Ghost Whisperer]]'', and ''[[Medium (TV show)|Medium]]''.

In animated fictional television programming, ghosts have served as the central element in series such as ''[[Casper the Friendly Ghost]]'', ''[[Danny Phantom]]'', and ''[[Scooby-Doo]]''. Various other television shows have depicted ghosts as well. {{See also|List of ghosts#Popular culture|Category:Fictional ghosts}}&lt;!-- please do not add a list of trivia.--&gt;

==Metaphorical usages==
[[Nietzsche]] argued that people generally wear prudent [[persona (psychology)|masks]] in company; but that an alternative strategy for social interaction is to present oneself as an absence, as a social ghost – "One reaches out for us but gets no hold of us"&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Gary Gutting ed., ''The Cambridge Companion to Foucault'' (2003) p. 235&lt;/ref&gt; – a sentiment later echoed (if in a less positive way) by [[Carl Jung]].&lt;ref&gt;C. G. Jung, ''Two Essays on Analytical Psychology'' (London 1953) p. 197&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nick Harkaway]] has considered that all people carry a host of ghosts in their heads in the form of impressions of past acquaintances – ghosts who represent mental maps of other people in the world and serve as philosophical reference points.&lt;ref&gt;Nick Harkaway, ''The Gone-Away World'' (2008) p. 380&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Object relations theory]] sees human personalities as formed by [[splitting (psychology)|splitting off]] aspects of the person that he or she deems incompatible; whereupon the person may be haunted in later life by such ghosts of his or her alternate selves.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Parsons, ''The Dove that Returns, the Dove that Vanishes'' (2000) p. 83-4&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hastings Ndlovu''' (1961 – 16 June 1976) was a schoolboy who was killed in the [[Soweto uprising]] against the [[History of South Africa in the apartheid era|apartheid]] system in [[South Africa]].

==Life==
On 16 June 1976, when the police from the [[Orlando Police Station]] led by Colonel Kleingeld opened fire on Soweto [[students]] protesting against the imposition of [[Afrikaans language|Afrikaans]] instruction in school, he took the first bullet. Hastings Ndlovu's death did not become as iconic as [[Hector Pieterson]]'s because no photographer was present to record it. Colonel Kleingeld said at the [[Cillie Commission]] that Hastings 'was inciting the crowd'.&lt;ref name=hastings/&gt;

== First fatality? ==
There is some doubt as to who was the first [[Death|fatality]], as Hector Pieterson was pronounced dead upon arrival at the clinic, whereas Hastings Ndlovu died from bullet wounds to the head shortly after being brought to the clinic. It is still not clear who died first, Hector Pieterson or Hastings Ndlovu, but it is likely that Pieterson was the first death on that day.

Hastings Ndlovu was survived by his parents, three sisters and brother. His sisters left the country soon after June 16, but returned to [[Johannesburg]] a few  years later.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.southafrica.info/about/history/hastings-ndlovu-150605.htm Hastings: forgotten hero of 1976] South Africa Info, 15 June 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
Hastings Ndlovu was buried with Hector Pieterson at [[Avalon Cemetery]] in Johannesburg. His house at 7235 Thabete Street, Soweto, Johannesburg had a [[blue plaque]] attached to it on 16 June 2012 to commemorate his sacrifice.&lt;ref name=hastings&gt;{{cite web|title=Home of Hastings Ndlovu|url=http://www.blueplaques.co.za/content/home-hastings-ndlovu|publisher=blueplaques.co.za|accessdate=20 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Taíno people|Taíno]] culture, the '''hupia''' (also ''opia'', ''opi'a'', ''op'a'', ''operi'to'') is the spirit of a person who has died.  

In Taíno spiritual beliefs, hupias (ghost spirits of those who had died) were contrasted with [[goeiza]], spirits of the living. While a living ''goieza'' had definite form, after passing away the spirit was released as a ''hupia'' and went to live in a remote earthly paradise called [[Coaybay]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kislakfoundation.org/prize/200103.html#ref22|author=Maria Poviones-Bishop|title=The Bat and the Guava: Life and the Afterlife in the Taíno Worldview}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hupias were believed to be able to assume many forms, sometimes appearing as faceless people or taking the form of a deceased loved one. Hupias in human form could always be distinguished by their lack of a navel. Hupias were also associated with [[bat]]s and said to hide or sleep during the day and come out at night to eat [[guava]] fruit. 

Hupias, as ghost spirits of those who died and the night, were feared and said to seduce women and kidnap people who ventured outside after dark.{{cn|date=June 2012}}

==Concept of the Hupias or Ghost Spirits==
On the matter of what the Tainos believed as to the Hupia (Ghost Spirit). The Taino people never believed in the concept and or idea of Death, as they believed in passing on of the human spirit and an Hereafter life. The Spanish historians and writers of the time however gave their own bias religious interpretation based upon their own Catholic and Christian ideas and or concepts of Death and as to the soul of the humans going to some place they call Heaven and the soul awaiting a day of judgement by their God.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}

==Literary references==
In the novel ''[[Jurassic Park (novel)|Jurassic Park]]'' by [[Michael Crichton]], hupia are suspected of an attack on an 18-year-old boy working construction of the dinosaur theme park on Isla Nublar. This culprit is later described as a velociraptor. Hupia are also accused of a rash of attacks on infants and other people in rural [[Costa Rica]]. They were described as "faceless night ghosts who kidnapped small children". Later events showed that the real culprits were [[Procompsognathus]]es that had escaped from Isla Nublar.

'''Information space analysis''' is a [[deterministic]] method, enhanced by [[Artificial intelligence|machine intelligence]], for locating and assessing [[resource]]s for team-centric efforts.

Organizations need to be able to quickly assemble teams backed by the support services, information, and material to do the job. To do so, these teams need to find and assess sources of services that are potential participants in the team effort. To support this initial team and resource development, information needs to be developed via analysis tools that help make sense of sets of [[Computer file|data sources]] in an [[Intranet]] or [[Internet]]. Part of the process is to characterize them, partition them, and sort and filter them.

These tools focus on three key issues in forming a collaborative team: 
#Help individuals responsible for forming the team understand what is available.
#Assist team members in identifying the structure and categorize the [[information]] available to them in a manner specifically suited to the task at hand.
#Aid team members to understand the mappings of their information between their [[organization]] and that used by others who might participate.

Information space analysis tools combine multiple methods to assist in this task. This causes the tools to be particularly well-suited to integrating additional [[technology|technologies]] in order to create specialized systems.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6247">'''[[Iodine deficiency]]''' is a widespread problem in [[Western China|western]], [[Northern and southern China|southern]] and [[East China|eastern]] parts of [[People's Republic of China|China]], as their [[iodized salt]] intake level is much lower than the average national level. [[Iodine deficiency]] is a range of disorders that affect many different populations. It is estimated that IDDs affect between 800 million and 2 billion people worldwide; countries have spent millions of dollars in implementing iodized salt as a means to counteract the iodine deficiencies prevalent today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Piccone|first=N|title=The Silent Epidemic of Iodine Deficiency|journal=Life Extension|year=2011|volume=17|issue=10|pages=42–51}}&lt;/ref&gt; With [[China]] accounting for "40% of the total population",&lt;ref name=WHO&gt;{{cite web|last=World Health Organization|title=Nutrition—Micronutrient Deficiencies: Iodine Deficiency Disorders|url=http://www.who.int/nutrition/topics/|accessdate=23 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  it bears a large portion of those who are iodine deficient.

[[Iodine]] is a [[micronutrient]] the body needs to properly produce [[thyroid]] hormones. The human body is not able to produce it, and iodine is an essential nutrient. Iodine is not readily available in many foods, thus making it difficult for many people to obtain it. One particular source, found in great supply, is ocean water although it is not an effective dietary source. Iodine deficiency diseases (IDDs) are able to develop before birth, so it is crucial for all populations to have sufficient levels of the micronutrient and prevent such diseases from developing early on.

== The Chinese government and iodine regulations ==

The Chinese government implemented a program of regulating salt to contain iodine starting in 1995. A more recent study has confirmed that the availability of iodized salt in the provinces has increased since this date. Today, about one third of the Chinese population is living in areas with low concentrations of iodine in their water supply.&lt;ref name=WHO /&gt; Salt is available in China for less than the retail price in some other countries, at about 5 cents, and is consumed regularly in most diets. This is very cost effective for producers who now must abide by the iodized salt regulations and those for those who need to consume it. The black market, however, is laden with the non-iodized counterpart and partially accounts for the population still be fairly saturated with IDDs.

== Implementations of solutions ==
The levels of iodized salt were measured in a urinalysis of households in China. It was confirmed that about 15–25 &amp;nbsp; mg/kg of iodized salt content in the diet was sufficient in preventing IDDs and preventing side effects of over consumption. In provinces where people are consuming less than this amount, there is an increased amount of improper brain development in children. Furthermore, one can see the relation between the importance of iodine in thyroid hormones and the IDD [[goitre]]. This disease causes a swelling in the neck, where the thyroid glands are, leading to impaired cognitive abilities.  The child population was about 20% saturated with the disease but continues to decrease with the new initiatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Li|first=S|title=Is the current iodine content in edible salt appropriate for eliminating iodine deficiency in China|journal=Asia Pacific Journal of Clinical Nutrition|year=2010 |volume=19 |issue=2 |url=http://apjcn.nhri.org.tw/server/APJCN/Volume19/vol19.2/Finished/index.php |accessdate=23 March 2012|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another common IDD prevalent in China is [[Kashin-Beck disease]]{{Citation needed|reason=Sources needed for this medical claim|date=March 2018}}. A particular outbreak in Tibet was recorded as occurring from lack of iodine. Kashin-Beck is a bone deformity endemic. Iodine deficiency, hypothyroidism, and low serum concentrations of [[thyroxine-binding globulin]] were significantly related to Kashin–Beck disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Moreno-Reyes|first=R|title=Kashin–Beck Osteoarthropathy in Rural Tibet in Relation to Selenium and Iodine Status|journal=[[The New England Journal of Medicine]] |year=1998|volume=339|pages=1112–1120 |url=http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM199810153391604#t=articleTop |accessdate=23 March 2012|doi=10.1056/NEJM199810153391604|pmid=9770558|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Iodine supplemented irrigation water in combination to iodized salt helps in reducing the neonatal and infant mortality rates. The province of [[Xinjiang]] suffers severely from IDDs and in 1993, started the use of potassium iodate in combination with irrigation water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=DeLong|first=R|title=Effect on infant mortality of iodination of irrigation water in a|journal=The Lancet|year=1997|volume=350|pages=771–773 |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140673696123655|accessdate=23 March 2012|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(96)12365-5|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Irrigation water is widely used and accessible to all households making it the predominant solution in reducing micronutrient deficiencies for Xinjiang.

This '''list of fictional plants''' describes invented plants that appear in works of [[fiction]].

==In fiction==
* '''Bat-thorn''': a plant, similar to [[Aconitum|wolfsbane]], offering protection against [[vampire]]s in ''[[Mark of the Vampire]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title.jsp?stid=82936|title=Mark of the Vampire (1935) - Overview - TCM.com|website=Turner Classic Movies}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''[[Biollante]]''': a monster plant of titanic proportions in the movie ''[[Godzilla vs Biollante]]''.
*'''[[Bas-Lag#Cactacae|Cactacae]]''': sentient races of cactus people from [[China Miéville]]'s [[Bas-Lag]] series (unlike the real [[Cactaceae]] family of [[xerophyte]]s).
*'''[[Candypop Bud]]''': a flower found in the video games ''[[Pikmin]]'' and ''[[Pikmin 2]]''.
*'''[[Chuck the Plant]]''': a plant found in several of [[LucasArts]]' games
*'''[[Dyson tree]]''': a hypothetical [[genetic engineering|genetically-engineered]] plant, (perhaps resembling a tree) capable of growing on a comet, suggested by the physicist [[Freeman Dyson]]
* '''Elowan''': a race of plant-like creatures in ''[[Starflight]]'' computer game,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://home.att.net/~starflight.choreo/races/elo.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-04-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070518063251/http://home.att.net/~starflight.choreo/races/elo.htm |archivedate=2007-05-18 |df= }} {{Self-published source|date=September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''[[Flower of Life (fiction)|Flower of Life]]''': a flower featured in some anime series: ''[[The Super Dimension Cavalry Southern Cross]]'', ''[[Robotech]]'' or ''[[Nurse Angel Ririka SOS]]''
*'''[[Genesis Tree]]s''': trees located in the world of Legaia from the video game ''[[Legend of Legaia]]''. They have the power to keep a large area free of the [[Mist (Legend of Legaia)|Mist]].
* '''G'Quan Eth''': plant indigenous to the [[Narn]] homeworld, used as incense in religious ceremonies from ''[[Babylon 5]]'' TV series. It is ritually burned as incense, and its seeds are a narcotic for [[Centauri (Babylon 5)|Centauri]] when dropped in [[alcohol]]. The G'Quan Eth plant is "difficult to grow, expensive to transport, very expensive to own."&lt;ref name="midwint"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.midwinter.com/lurk/synops/012.html|title=Synopsis: "By Any Means Necessary"|website=www.midwinter.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whether it affects other species in this way when in alcohol is not clear, but we know that Narn don't seem to use it as a recreational drug (Londo chides G'Kar for Narns "It's a shame you Narns waste them, burning them as incense"&lt;ref name="midwint"/&gt;) and that it is illegal to possess on B5 except in religious contexts.

This real 400 year old [[pollarded]] tree in [[Frithsden Beeches]] on [[Berkhamsted]] Common "played" (with a bit of CGI tweaking) the Whomping Willow in the Harry Potter Film "[[The Prisoner of Azkaban]]". In 1866, it was at the centre of the [[Berkhamsted#Development of the modern town (19th and 20th century)|Battle of Berkhamsted Common]]. It was also noted by the naturalist [[Richard Mabey]] in his book "Beechcombings".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.newstatesman.com/culture/nature/2015/11/queen-beech-ruled-land-even-when-she-fell | title=The queen beech ruled the land, even when she fell | work=[[New Statesman]] | date=7 November 2015 | accessdate=7 November 2015 | author=Mabey, Richard}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
*'''[[Mandrake (mythology)|Mandrakes]]''': tubers that look like babies when young. Their screams can kill when fully grown. A potion made from mature mandrakes can restore victims that have been petrified. A different kind of [[Mandragora (genus)|mandrake]] is a real plant. Whilst the mandrake as it appears in the books and films is fictional, Rowling's description does reflect genuinely held beliefs about the mandrake, in particular, the danger surrounding its screams. This led to the practice of using dogs to collect the mandrake, and the blocking of ears during collecting.

===In ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons''===
{{main|Plant creatures (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)}}

*'''[[Ascomoid]]''': 
*'''[[Assassin vine]]''': a plant that will attempt to strangle anyone who ventures under it.

===In ''Monty Python's Flying Circus''===
The following plants appear in the [[David Attenborough]] sketch of the [[List of Monty Python's Flying Circus episodes#6. Party Political Broadcast|last Monty Python episode.]]
* '''Angolan sauntering tree (''Amazellus robin ray'')'''.
* '''Gambian sidling bush'''.
* '''Puking Tree of Mozambique'''.
* '''The Turkish little rude plant''': A remarkably smutty piece of flora used by the Turks.
* '''Walking tree of Dahomey (''Quercus nicholas parsonus'')''': the legendary walking tree that can achieve speeds of up to 50 miles an hour, especially when it is in a hurry. There is movie footage from the late 1940s in which a walking tree actually sprints after a cheetah. Very funny, although the cheetah was subsequently quite rooted.

===In the 2009 film ''Avatar''===
Plants in [[Fictional universe of Avatar|Pandora]] have evolved according to the characteristics of their environment, which has an atmosphere that is thicker than on Earth, with higher concentrations of carbon dioxide, xenon and hydrogen sulfide. Gravity is weaker in Pandora, thereby giving rise to gigantism. There is a strong magnetic field, causing plants to develop 'magnetotropism'. A particularly intriguing quality of flora and fauna in Pandora is their ability to communicate with each other. This is explained in the movie as a phenomenon called 'signal transduction', pertaining to how plants perceive a signal and respond to it.

===In DC Comics===
The '''Black Mercy''' is an extraterrestrial hallucinogenic plant used a weapon by the supervillain [[Mongul]]. Mongul first uses it in "[[For the Man Who Has Everything]]", a story by [[Alan Moore]] and [[Dave Gibbons]] that was first published in ''[[Superman (comic book)|Superman]] [[Annual publication|Annual]]'' #11 (1985) and later adapted into the ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' [[List of Justice League episodes#Season 1 (2004–05)|episode of the same name]] and for one episode of "[[Supergirl (2015 TV series)|Supergirl]]" called "For the Girl Who Has Everything", where in that episode the plant was sent by Kryptonian [[Non (comics)]]. Described in the original story by Mongul as "something between a plant and an intelligent fungus", the Black Mercy attaches itself to its victims in a form of [[symbiosis]], and feeds from the victim's "[[bio-aura]]". The organism is telepathic, and reads its victim's heart's desire, giving them a logical simulation and an ending that the victim wants, which the victim experiences an entirely immersive, virtual experience in which their actual surroundings are masked to them. According to Mongul, victims are capable of "shrugging off" the hallucination, though some find the experience too compelling too do so unaided.&lt;ref name=ActionAnnual11&gt;[[Moore, Alan]] (w), [[Gibbons, Dave]] (a). "[[For the Man Who Has Everything]]", ''[[Superman (comic book)|Superman]] [[Annual publication|Annual]]'' #11 (1985). [[DC Comics]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The Black Mercy is typically depicted as consisting of dark green, thorned vines that attach themselves to a humanoid victim's upper torso, with a set of pink flowers, each with a long, red, tentacle-like [[Stigma (botany)|stigma]], growing in the center of the victim's chest. When Mongul first uses the Black Mercy on Superman, they burrow through his costume and into his body, able to penetrate his otherwise invulnerable skin because, Wonder Woman senses, they are at least partially magical, which is one of Superman's weaknesses. During his experience with the organism, Superman's breathing appears faint, and his ability to sense the fraudulent nature of the simulation it feeds him and fight it manifests itself as tears produced by his actual eyes. The Black Mercy can pulled off a victim by a strong humanoid such as Batman, and Mongul uses special protective gauntlets to handle the plant safely.&lt;ref name=ActionAnnual11/&gt; Superman is not able to awaken from the Black Mercy's simulation without help from Batman, though [[Oliver Queen]] and [[Hal Jordan]] are both able to do so in a subsequent storyline.&lt;ref name=APerfectLife&gt;[[Johns, Geoff]] (w), [[Pacheco, Carlos]] (p), Merino, Jesus (i). "A Perfect Life: Chapters 1-2", ''[[Green Lantern]]'' (Vol. 4) #7-8 (February–March 2006). DC Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the video game, ''[[Injustice 2]]'' Supergirl mentions Black Mercy in pre-battle dialogue with Scarecrow. She states dealing with him is no different than dealing with Black Mercy, causing Scarecrow to ask her what is Black Mercy out of curiosity, causing Supergirl to describe it as an evil space plant.

Characters who have experienced the Black Mercy include:
*'''Superman''' sees himself on a still-intact Krypton with his biological parents, married to a retired actress named Lyla, and a son named Van.&lt;ref name=ActionAnnual11/&gt; 
*'''Batman''' envisions a life in which his parents were not murdered during his childhood, and he is married to [[Kathy Kane]].&lt;ref name=ActionAnnual11/&gt;
*'''Mongul''' envisions a life in which he successfully kills Superman, before setting out across the universe, killing all of his enemies, entire populations kneeling before him amid his destruction of countless galaxies.&lt;ref name=ActionAnnual11/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Jurgens, Dan]] (w), [[Zircher, Patrick]] (a). "Revenge, Part I". ''[[Action Comics]]'' #979 (Early June 2017). DC Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Green Arrow''' envisions a life in which he is married to Sandra "Moonday" Hawke, and in addition to their older son [[Connor Hawke|Connor]], they have a younger son, and a newborn third. When Mongul uses the Black Mercy on him, Green Arrow was caught along with Hal Jordan, with the result that he saw what Hal believed would be his perfect life.&lt;ref name=APerfectLife/&gt;
*'''Hal Jordan''' envisions a life in which his parents and his siblings are present in his life, and Sinestro is a friend who fights by his side as a member of the [[Green Lantern Corps]]. When Mongul uses the Black Mercy on him, Jordan was caught in the same illusion as Oliver Queen, which resulted in Jordan creating what ''he'' believed would be Queen's perfect life rather than Queen experiencing his own idea of a perfect life, allowing Queen to see through its simulation and thus awaken from it.&lt;ref name=APerfectLife/&gt;

==In mythology==
*'''[[Austras koks]]''': a tree which grows from the start of the Sun's daily journey across the sky in [[Latvian mythology]]
* '''Barnacle tree''': mythical tree believed in the [[Middle Ages]] to have barnacles that opened to reveal [[Barnacle goose|geese]]. The story may have started from [[goose barnacle]]s growing on [[driftwood]].
*'''[[Lotus tree]]''': a plant in Greek mythology bearing a fruit that caused a pleasant drowsiness. It may have been real (a type of [[Ziziphus|jujube]] (perhaps ''Ziziphus lotus'') or the [[date palm]]).
*'''[[Moly (herb)|Moly]]''': a magic herb in Greek mythology with a black root and white blossoms
*'''[[Raskovnik]]''': a magic plant in [[Serbian mythology]] which can open any [[Lock (security device)|lock]]
*'''[[Vegetable Lamb of Tartary]]''': a mythical plant supposed by medieval thinkers to explain the existence of [[cotton]]
*'''[[Yggdrasil]]''': the [[World tree]] of [[Norse mythology]]

==Hoaxes==
*'''[[Man-eating tree]]''' or '''Madagascar tree''': a fictitious tree in the forests of [[Madagascar]]. There are stories of similar trees in the jungles of [[Mindanao Island]] in the Philippines. The tree is said to have a gray trunk and animated vine-like stems used to capture and kill humans and other large animals. Comparable plants are mentioned in tall tales and fiction.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}
*'''[[Spaghetti tree]]''': a tree from which [[spaghetti]] is harvested. It was an [[April Fool's Day]] joke launched by the [[BBC]] TV programme ''[[Panorama (TV series)|Panorama]]'' in 1957.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="96563">{{Map of 2018 United States mass shootings}}

This is a '''list of known mass shootings in the United States''' that have occurred since 1966&lt;!-- This should possibly be put up for discussion, but it's the timeline the original author put in place—see https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:List_of_mass_shootings_in_the_United_States&amp;oldid=856826012 --&gt;. Mass shootings are incidents involving multiple victims of firearm-related violence. The precise inclusion criteria are disputed, and there is no broadly accepted definition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2017/10/04/the-squishy-definition-of-mass-shooting-complicates-media-coverage/|title=The squishy definition of ‘mass shooting’ complicates media coverage|last=Borchers|first=Callum|date=October 4, 2017|website=Washington Post|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=August 26, 2018|quote=...'mass shooting' is a term without a universally-accepted definition.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R43004.pdf|title=Public Mass Shootings in the United States|last=Bjelopera|first=Jerome|date=March 18, 2013|website=Congressional Research Service|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-08-26|quote="There is no broadly agreed-to, specific conceptualization of this issue, so this report uses its own definition for public mass shootings."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Gun Violence Archive]], a nonprofit research group that tracks shootings and their characteristics in the United States, defines a mass shooting as an incident in which four or more people, excluding the perpetrator(s), are shot in one location at roughly the same time.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gunviolencearchive.org/methodology|title=General Methodology|last=|first=|date=|website=Gun Violence Archive|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=August 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Congressional Research Service]] narrows that definition further, only considering what it defines as "public mass shootings", and only considering victims as those who are killed, excluding any victims who survive.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; [[The Washington Post|''The Washington Post'']] and [[Mother Jones (magazine)|''Mother Jones'']] use similar definitions, with the latter acknowledging that their definition "is a conservative measure of the problem", as many rampages with fewer fatalities occur.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2018/national/mass-shootings-in-america/|title=More than 50 years of U.S. mass shootings: The victims, sites, killers and weapons|last=Berkowitz|first=Bonnie|last2=Lu|first2=Denise|date=September 14, 2018|website=Washington Post|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=August 27, 2018|last3=Alcantara|first3=Chris}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2012/07/mass-shootings-map/|title=A Guide to Mass Shootings in America|last=Follman|first=Mark|date=September 20, 2018|work=Mother Jones|access-date=August 26, 2018|last2=Aronsen|first2=Gavin|language=en-US|last3=Pan|first3=Deanna}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Crowdsourcing|crowdsourced]] Mass Shooting Tracker project uses a definition even looser than the Gun Violence Archive's definition: four people shot in one incident regardless of the circumstances.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.massshootingtracker.org/about|title=Mass Shooting Tracker|last=|first=|date=|website=Mass Shooting Tracker|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=August 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Larger documentation of mass shootings in the United States has occurred through independent and scholarly studies such as the [[Stanford University]] Mass Shootings of American Data Project.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://library.stanford.edu/projects/mass-shootings-america|title=Mass Shootings in America|last=|first=|date=|work=Stanford Libraries|access-date=September 23, 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== List of mass shootings (2013–present) ==
There are many definitions for what a mass shooting is:

:Mass Shooting Tracker: 4+ shot in one incident, at one location, at roughly the same time.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
:Gun Violence Archive: 4+ shot in one incident, excluding the perpetrator(s), at one location, at roughly the same time.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;
:''[[Vox (website)|Vox]]'': 4+ shot in one incident, excluding the perpetrator(s), at one location, at roughly the same time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2015/12/4/9850758/mass-shooting-definition|title=The debate over how to define mass shootings is ridiculous|last=Lopez|first=German|date=December 4, 2015|work=Vox|access-date=August 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.vox.com/a/mass-shootings-america-sandy-hook-gun-violence|title=Mass shootings since Sandy Hook, in one map|last=Lopez|first=German|date=July 9, 2018|work=Vox|access-date=August 27, 2018|last2=Sukumar|first2=Kavya|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:[[USA Today|''USA Today'']]: 4+ shot and killed in one incident, at one location, at roughly the same time (same as the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]]'s "mass killing" definition).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/mass-killings/index.html|title=Behind the Bloodshed: The Untold Story of America's Mass Killings|last=|first=|date=|work=USA Today|access-date=August 27, 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:[[Mother Jones (magazine)|''Mother Jones'']]: 3+ shot and killed in one incident, excluding the perpetrator(s), at a public place, excluding gang-related killings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.motherjones.com/crime-justice/2012/08/what-is-a-mass-shooting/|title=What Exactly Is a Mass Shooting?|last=Follman|first=Mark|date=August 24, 2012|work=Mother Jones|access-date=August 27, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:''[[The Washington Post]]'': 4+ shot and killed in one incident, excluding the perpetrator(s), at a public place, excluding gang-related killings.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Only incidents considered mass shootings by at least two of the above definitions are listed, and only shootings that have Wikipedia articles of their own are included in this list. Detailed lists of shootings can be found per-year at their respective pages.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3865">'''Maurice Généreux''' is a Canadian physician who was convicted in 1998 of prescribing medications to two HIV-positive men in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]], Canada, in 1996—medications that allowed the men, Mark Jewitt and Aaron Mcginn, to commit suicide in 1996. Généreux was the first doctor in [[North America]] to be convicted of assisting a suicide (followed in 1999 by [[Jack Kevorkian]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1= |author2= |date=23 May 1998

Mark Jewitt took a lethal dose but managed to survive after a friend found him and called the emergency services. Aaron McGinn died in 1996 from an overdose of sleeping pills provided by Généreux. Généreux forged McGinn's death certificate, moreover, to make it look as if McGinn had died from AIDS rather than from sleeping pills. The investigation into Généreux started when a friend raised doubts about McGinn's death to the chief coroner in Toronto. Following an investigation, Généreux was arrested on 20 June 1996.&lt;ref name="Dowbiggin2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ian Dowbiggin|title=A Concise History of Euthanasia: Life, Death, God, and Medicine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CNigO7gMGkUC&amp;pg=PA62|accessdate=23 June 2011|date=March 2007|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|isbn=978-0-7425-3111-6|pages=1–2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Généreux was sent to prison for two years minus a day and lost his medical license.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= |date=12 March 1998 |title=Genereux's license revoked  |work=[[CBC News]] |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/story/1998/03/12/genereux980312b.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theinterim.com/june98/01genereux.html Light sentence disturbs pro-lifers] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927170856/http://www.theinterim.com/june98/01genereux.html |date=2011-09-27 }}, ''The Interim'', June 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Ian Dowbiggin, the author of ''A Concise History of Euthanasia'', Généreux's actions revealed an "underground" network of euthanasia provision for AIDS sufferers in Toronto's gay community;&lt;ref name="Dowbiggin2007" /&gt; however, Dowbiggin's assertions have not been proven. Aaron McGinn was HIV positive but he was not palliative and could have lived a long and healthy life with the medications available. Genereux's actions revealed a failure of the judicial system and The College of Physicians and Surgeons of Ontario (the self-regulating governing body for the province's medical profession). Généreux had previous convictions for sexually assaulting his patients but was allowed to continue practising medicine.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6670">The '''Mental Deficiency Act 1913''' was an act of the United Kingdom which made provisions for the institutional treatment of people deemed to be "[[feeble-minded]]" and "moral defectives".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://studymore.org.uk/mhhglo.htm#MentalDeficiency|title=Mental Health (History) Dictionary|publisher=studymore.org.uk|accessdate=13 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; "It proposed an institutional separation so that mental defectives should be taken out of Poor Law institutions and prisons into newly established colonies."&lt;ref&gt;Anne Digby, "Contexts and perspectives" in{{cite book |title=From Idiocy to Mental Deficiency: Historical Perspectives on People With Learning Disabilities|editors=David Wright, Anne Digby|location=London|publisher=Routledge|year=1996|isbn=0-203-16224-2}} 1-21&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The [[Idiots Act 1886]] made the legal distinction between "[[idiot]]s" and "[[imbecile]]s". It contained educational provisions for the needs of people deemed to be in these categories. In 1904 the Royal Commission on the Care and Control of the Feeble-Minded was set up with the warrant "to consider the existing methods of dealing with idiots and epileptics, and with imbecile, feeble-minded, or defective persons not certified under the Lunacy Laws... to report as to the amendments in the law or other measures which should be adopted in the matter".&lt;ref name=royal-commission&gt;{{cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/reportroyalcomm00mindgoog |title=Report of the Royal Commission on the Care And Control of the Feebleminded |publisher=His Majesty's Stationery Office |year=1908 |accessdate=6 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Commission returned a lengthy report in 1908 which estimated that of a population of 32,527,843 British inhabitants 149,628 people (0.46%) were considered "mentally defective". It recommended the establishment of a board of control which would oversee local authority efforts aimed at "the well-being of the mentally defective".&lt;ref&gt;British Medical Journal #2485, Aug. 15, 1908, pp. 415&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=paget-1911&gt;{{cite book |pages=11-45 |url=https://archive.org/details/feeblemindedness00lapa |title=Feeblemindedness in Children of School-Age |author=Charles Paget Lapage |publisher=Manchester University Press |year=1911 |accessdate=6 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Winston Churchill]] spoke of the need to introduce compulsory labour camps for "mental defectives" in the House of Commons in February 1911. In May 1912 a Private Members' Bill entitled the "Feeble-Minded Control Bill" was introduced in the House of Commons, which called for the implementation of the Royal Commission's conclusions. It rejected sterilisation of the "feeble-minded", but had provision for registration and segregation.&lt;ref name="gilbert"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.winstonchurchill.org/support/the-churchill-centre/publications/finest-hour-online/594-churchill-and-eugenics |title=Churchill and Eugenics |author=Sir Martin Gilbert CBE |date=31 May 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131215071541/http://www.winstonchurchill.org/support/the-churchill-centre/publications/finest-hour-online/594-churchill-and-eugenics |archivedate=15 December 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the few voices raised against the bill was that of [[G.K. Chesterton]] who ridiculed the bill, calling it the "Feeble-Minded Bill, both for brevity and because the description is strictly accurate".&lt;ref&gt;''Eugenics and Other Evils'', 1923, Chapter 2.&lt;/ref&gt; The bill was withdrawn, but a government bill introduced on 10 June 1912 replaced it, which would become the Mental Deficiency Act 1913.&lt;ref name="gilbert" /&gt;

==The Mental Deficiency Act==
The bill was passed in 1913 with only three MPs voting against it.&lt;ref name="gilbert" /&gt; One of them was [[Josiah Wedgwood, 1st Baron Wedgwood|Josiah Wedgwood]], who said of it, "It is a spirit of the Horrible Eugenic Society which is setting out to breed up the working class as though they were cattle."&lt;ref&gt;Jayne Woodhouse, "Eugenics and the feeble-minded: the Parliamentary debates of 1912-14", ''History of Education'' 11:2, 133&lt;/ref&gt; The new act repealed the Idiots Act 1886 and followed the recommendations of the Royal Commission on the Care and Control of the Feeble-Minded. It established the [[Board of Control for Lunacy and Mental Deficiency]] to oversee the implementation of provisions for the care and management of four classes of people,

:a) ''Idiots.'' Those so deeply defective as to be unable to guard themselves against common physical dangers.

:b) ''Imbeciles.'' Whose defectiveness does not amount to idiocy, but is so pronounced that they are incapable of managing themselves or their affairs, or, in the case of children, of being taught to do so.

:c) ''Feeble-minded persons.'' Whose weakness does not amount to imbecility, yet who require care, supervision, or control, for their protection or for the protection of others, or, in the case of children, are incapable of receiving benefit from the instruction in ordinary schools.

:d) ''Moral Imbeciles.'' Displaying mental weakness coupled with strong vicious or criminal propensities, and on whom punishment has little or no deterrent effect.&lt;ref&gt;Gattie, W. H., Holt-Hughes, T. H., "Note on the Mental Deficiency Act, 1913", ''The Law Quarterly Review'' 30 (1914) 202&lt;/ref&gt;

A person deemed to be an idiot or imbecile might be placed in an institution or under guardianship if the parent or guardian so petitioned, as could a person of any of the four categories under 21 years, as could a person of any category who had been abandoned, neglected, guilty of a crime, in a state institution, habitually drunk, or unable to be schooled.&lt;ref&gt;Gattie, W. H., Holt-Hughes, T. H., "Note on the Mental Deficiency Act, 1913", ''The Law Quarterly Review'' 30 (1914) 209&lt;/ref&gt;

At the height of operation of the Mental Deficiency Act, 65,000 people were placed in "colonies" or in other institutional settings. The act remained in effect until it was repealed by the [[Mental Health Act 1959]].&lt;ref&gt;Jan Walmsley, "Women and the Mental Deficiency Act of 1913: citizenship, sexuality and regulation", ''British Journal of Learning Disabilities'', 28 (2000), 65.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
Neurons are remarkable among the [[cells (biology)|cells]] of the body in their ability to propagate signals rapidly over large distances. They do this by generating characteristic electrical pulses called [[action potentials]]: voltage spikes that can travel down nerve fibers. Sensory neurons change their activities by firing sequences of action potentials in various temporal patterns, with the presence of external sensory stimuli, such as [[light]], [[sound]], [[taste]], [[Olfaction|smell]] and [[touch]]. It is known that information about the stimulus is encoded in this pattern of action potentials and transmitted into and around the brain.

Although action potentials can vary somewhat in duration, [[amplitude]] and shape, they are typically treated as identical stereotyped events in neural coding studies. If the brief duration of an action potential (about 1ms) is ignored, an action potential sequence, or spike train, can be characterized simply by a series of [[all-or-none law|all-or-none]] point events in time.&lt;ref name="Gerstner"&gt;{{cite book |first1=Wulfram |last1=Gerstner |first2=Werner M. |last2=Kistler |title=Spiking Neuron Models: Single Neurons, Populations, Plasticity |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Rs4oc7HfxIUC |year=2002 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-89079-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lengths of interspike intervals ([[Temporal coding|ISI]]s) between two successive spikes in a spike train often vary, apparently randomly.&lt;ref name="Stein"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Stein RB, Gossen ER, Jones KE |title=Neuronal variability: noise or part of the signal? |journal=Nat. Rev. Neurosci. |volume=6 |issue=5 |pages=389–97 |date=May 2005 |pmid=15861181 |doi=10.1038/nrn1668 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The study of neural coding involves measuring and characterizing how stimulus attributes, such as light or sound intensity, or motor actions, such as the direction of an arm movement, are represented by neuron action potentials or spikes. In order to describe and analyze neuronal firing, [[statistical methods]] and methods of [[probability theory]] and stochastic [[point process]]es have been widely applied.

With the development of large-scale neural recording and decoding technologies, researchers have begun to crack the neural code and have already provided the first glimpse into the real-time neural code as memory is formed and recalled in the hippocampus, a brain region known to be central for memory formation.&lt;ref&gt;The Memory Code. http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-memory-code/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Chen | first1 = G | last2 = Wang | first2 = LP | last3 = Tsien | first3 = JZ | year = 2009 | title = Neural population-level memory traces in the mouse hippocampus | journal = PLOS ONE | volume = 4 | issue = 12| page = e8256 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0008256 | pmid = 20016843 | pmc=2788416| bibcode = 2009PLoSO...4.8256C }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Zhang | first1 = H | last2 = Chen | first2 = G | last3 = Kuang | first3 = H | last4 = Tsien | first4 = JZ | date = Nov 2013 | title = Mapping and deciphering neural codes of NMDA receptor-dependent fear memory engrams in the hippocampus | journal = PLOS ONE | volume = 8 | issue = 11| page = e79454 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0079454 | pmid = 24302990 | pmc=3841182| bibcode = 2013PLoSO...879454Z }}&lt;/ref&gt; Neuroscientists have initiated several large-scale brain decoding projects.&lt;ref&gt;Brain Decoding Project. http://braindecodingproject.org/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Simons Collaboration on the Global Brain. https://www.simonsfoundation.org/life-sciences/simons-collaboration-global-brain/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Encoding and decoding ==
The link between stimulus and response can be studied from two opposite points of view. Neural encoding refers to the map from stimulus to response. The main focus is to understand how neurons respond to a wide variety of stimuli, and to construct models that attempt to predict responses to other stimuli. [[Neural decoding]] refers to the reverse map, from response to stimulus, and the challenge is to reconstruct a stimulus, or certain aspects of that stimulus, from the spike sequences it evokes.

== Hypothesized coding schemes ==
A sequence, or 'train', of spikes may contain information based on different coding schemes. In motor neurons, for example, the strength at which an innervated muscle is contracted depends solely on the 'firing rate', the average number of spikes per unit time (a 'rate code'). At the other end, a complex '[[temporal code]]' is based on the precise timing of single spikes. They may be locked to an external stimulus such as in the visual&lt;ref&gt;Burcas G.T &amp; Albright T.D. Gauging sensory representations in the brain. http://www.vcl.salk.edu/Publications/PDF/Buracas_Albright_1999_TINS.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  and [[auditory system]] or be generated intrinsically by the neural circuitry.&lt;ref name="Gerstner97"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gerstner W, Kreiter AK, Markram H, Herz AV |title=Neural codes: firing rates and beyond |journal=Proc.

Whether neurons use rate coding or temporal coding is a topic of intense debate within the neuroscience community, even though there is no clear definition of what these terms mean. In one theory, termed "neuroelectrodynamics", the following coding schemes are all considered to be epiphenomena, replaced instead by molecular changes reflecting the spatial distribution of [[electric field]]s within neurons as a result of the broad [[electromagnetic spectrum]] of action potentials, and manifested in information as [[spike directivity]].&lt;ref name="Aur and Jog"&gt;Aur D., Jog, MS., 2010  Neuroelectrodynamics: Understanding the brain language, IOS Press, 2010,  {{DOI|10.3233/978-1-60750-473-3-i}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Aur et., all"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Aur | first1 = D. | last2 = Connolly | first2 = C.I. | last3 = Jog | first3 = M.S. | year = 2005 | title = Computing spike directivity with tetrodes | url = | journal = J.

=== Rate coding ===
The rate coding model of [[neuron]]al firing communication states that as the intensity of a stimulus increases, the [[frequency]] or rate of [[action potential]]s, or "spike firing", increases. Rate coding is sometimes called frequency coding.

Rate coding is a traditional coding scheme, assuming that most, if not all, information about the stimulus is contained in the firing rate of the neuron. Because the sequence of action potentials generated by a given stimulus varies from trial to trial, neuronal responses are typically treated statistically or probabilistically. They may be characterized by firing rates, rather than as specific spike sequences. In most sensory systems, the firing rate increases, generally non-linearly, with increasing stimulus intensity.&lt;ref name="Kandel"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kandel |first1=E. |last2=Schwartz |first2=J. |last3=Jessel |first3=T.M. |title=Principles of Neural Science |publisher=Elsevier |year=1991 |isbn=978-0444015624 |edition=3rd |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=48hpAAAAMAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; Any information possibly encoded in the temporal structure of the spike train is ignored. Consequently, rate coding is inefficient but highly robust with respect to the ISI '[[noise]]'.&lt;ref name="Stein"/&gt;

During rate coding, precisely calculating firing rate is very important. In fact, the term "firing rate" has a few different definitions, which refer to different averaging procedures, such as an average over time or an average over several repetitions of experiment.

In rate coding, learning is based on activity-dependent synaptic weight modifications.

Rate coding was originally shown by [[Edgar Adrian|ED Adrian]] and [[Yngve Zotterman|Y Zotterman]] in 1926.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Adrian ED, Zotterman Y|year=1926|title=The impulses produced by sensory nerve endings: Part II: The response of a single end organ.|journal=J Physiol|volume=61|issue=2|pages=151–171|doi=10.1113/jphysiol.1926.sp002281|pmid=16993780|pmc=1514782}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this simple experiment different weights were hung from a [[muscle]]. As the weight of the stimulus increased, the number of spikes recorded from sensory nerves innervating the muscle also increased. From these original experiments, Adrian and Zotterman concluded that action potentials were unitary events, and that the frequency of events, and not individual event magnitude, was the basis for most inter-neuronal communication.

In the following decades, measurement of firing rates became a standard tool for describing the properties of all types of sensory or [[Cerebral cortex|cortical]] neurons, partly due to the relative ease of measuring rates experimentally. However, this approach neglects all the information possibly contained in the exact timing of the spikes. During recent years, more and more experimental evidence has suggested that a straightforward firing rate concept based on temporal averaging may be too simplistic to describe brain activity.&lt;ref name="Stein"/&gt;

==== Spike-count rate ====
The spike-count rate, also referred to as temporal average, is obtained by counting the number of spikes that appear during a trial and dividing by the duration of trial. The length T of the time window is set by the experimenter and depends on the type of neuron recorded from and to the stimulus. In practice, to get sensible averages, several spikes should occur within the time window. Typical values are T = 100 ms or T = 500 ms, but the duration may also be longer or shorter.&lt;ref name="icwww.epfl.ch"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://icwww.epfl.ch/~gerstner/SPNM/node7.html | title=1.5 Rate Codes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The spike-count rate can be determined from a single trial, but at the expense of losing all temporal resolution about variations in neural response during the course of the trial. Temporal averaging can work well in cases where the stimulus is constant or slowly varying and does not require a fast reaction of the [[organism]] — and this is the situation usually encountered in experimental protocols. Real-world input, however, is hardly stationary, but often changing on a fast time scale. For example, even when viewing a static image, humans perform [[saccades]], rapid changes of the direction of gaze. The image projected onto the retinal [[photoreceptor cell|photoreceptors]] changes therefore every few hundred milliseconds.&lt;ref name="icwww.epfl.ch"/&gt;

Despite its shortcomings, the concept of a spike-count rate code is widely used not only in experiments, but also in models of [[neural networks]]. It has led to the idea that a neuron transforms information about a single input variable (the stimulus strength) into a single continuous output variable (the firing rate).

There is a growing body of evidence that in [[Purkinje neurons]], at least, information is not simply encoded in firing but also in the timing and duration of non-firing, quiescent periods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Forrest MD |title=Intracellular Calcium Dynamics Permit a Purkinje Neuron Model to Perform Toggle and Gain Computations Upon its Inputs. |journal=Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience |volume=8 |pages=86 |year=2014 | doi=10.3389/fncom.2014.00086 |pmid=25191262 |pmc=4138505}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Forrest MD |title=The sodium-potassium pump is an information processing element in brain computation |journal= Frontiers in Physiology |volume=5 |issue=472 |pages=472 | date=December 2014 |doi=10.3389/fphys.2014.00472 |pmid=25566080 |pmc=4274886 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Time-dependent firing rate ====
{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2013}}
The time-dependent firing rate is defined as the average number of spikes (averaged over trials) appearing during a short interval between times t and t+Δt, divided by the duration of the interval. It works for stationary as well as for time-dependent stimuli. To experimentally measure the time-dependent firing rate, the experimenter records from a neuron while stimulating with some input sequence. The same stimulation sequence is repeated several times and the neuronal response is reported in a [[PSTH|Peri-Stimulus-Time Histogram]] (PSTH). The time t is measured with respect to the start of the stimulation sequence. The Δt must be large enough (typically in the range of one or a few milliseconds) so there are sufficient number of spikes within the interval to obtain a reliable estimate of the average. The number of occurrences of spikes n&lt;sub&gt;K&lt;/sub&gt;(t;t+Δt) summed over all repetitions of the experiment divided by the number K of repetitions is a measure of the typical activity of the neuron between time t and t+Δt. A further division by the interval length Δt yields time-dependent firing rate r(t) of the neuron, which is equivalent to the spike density of PSTH.

For sufficiently small Δt, r(t)Δt is the average number of spikes occurring between times t and t+Δt over multiple trials. If Δt is small, there will never be more than one spike within the interval between t and t+Δt on any given trial. This means that r(t)Δt is also the [[fraction (mathematics)|fraction]] of trials on which a spike occurred between those times. Equivalently, r(t)Δt is the [[probability]] that a spike occurs during this time interval.

As an experimental procedure, the time-dependent firing rate measure is a useful method to evaluate neuronal activity, in particular in the case of time-dependent stimuli. The obvious problem with this approach is that it can not be the coding scheme used by neurons in the brain. Neurons can not wait for the stimuli to repeatedly present in an exactly same manner before generating response.

Nevertheless, the experimental time-dependent firing rate measure can make sense, if there are large populations of independent neurons that receive the same stimulus. Instead of recording from a population of N neurons in a single run, it is experimentally easier to record from a single neuron and average over N repeated runs. Thus, the time-dependent firing rate coding relies on the implicit assumption that there are always populations of neurons.

When precise spike timing or high-frequency firing-rate [[Statistical fluctuations|fluctuations]] are found to carry information, the neural code is often identified as a temporal code.&lt;ref name="Dayan"&gt;{{cite book |first1=Peter |last1=Dayan |first2=L.

Neurons exhibit high-frequency fluctuations of firing-rates which could be noise or could carry information. Rate coding models suggest that these irregularities are noise, while temporal coding models suggest that they encode information. If the nervous system only used rate codes to convey information, a more consistent, regular firing rate would have been evolutionarily advantageous, and neurons would have utilized this code over other less robust options.&lt;ref name="van Hemmen 2006"&gt;J. Leo van Hemmen, TJ Sejnowski. 23 Problems in Systems Neuroscience. Oxford Univ. Press, 2006. p.143-158.&lt;/ref&gt; Temporal coding supplies an alternate explanation for the “noise," suggesting that it actually encodes information and affects neural processing. To model this idea, binary symbols can be used to mark the spikes: 1 for a spike, 0 for no spike. Temporal coding allows the sequence 000111000111 to mean something different from 001100110011, even though the mean firing rate is the same for both sequences, at 6 spikes/10&amp;nbsp;ms.&lt;ref name="Theunissen F 1995"/&gt; Until recently, scientists had put the most emphasis on rate encoding as an explanation for [[post-synaptic potential]] patterns. However, functions of the brain are more temporally precise than the use of only rate encoding seems to allow{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}. In other words, essential information could be lost due to the inability of the rate code to capture all the available information of the spike train. In addition, responses are different enough between similar (but not identical) stimuli to suggest that the distinct patterns of spikes contain a higher volume of information than is possible to include in a rate code.&lt;ref name="Zador, Stevens"&gt;{{cite web|last=Zador, Stevens|first=Charles, Anthony|title=The enigma of the brain|url=https://docs.google.com/a/stolaf.edu/viewer?a=v&amp;pid=gmail&amp;attid=0.1&amp;thid=1369b5e1cdf273f9&amp;mt=application/pdf&amp;url=https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/?ui%3D2%26ik%3D0a436eb2a7%26view%3Datt%26th%3D1369b5e1cdf273f9%26attid%3D0.1%26disp%3Dsafe%26realattid%3Df_h0ty13ea0%26zw&amp;sig=AHIEtbQB4vngr9nDZaMTLUOcrk5DzePKqA|work=© Current Biology 1995, Vol 5 No 12|accessdate=August 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Temporal codes employ those features of the spiking activity that cannot be described by the firing rate. For example, time to first spike after the stimulus onset, characteristics based on the second and higher statistical [[Moment (mathematics)|moments]] of the ISI [[probability distribution]], spike randomness, or precisely timed groups of spikes (temporal patterns) are candidates for temporal codes.&lt;ref name="Kostal"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kostal L, Lansky P, Rospars JP |title=Neuronal coding and spiking randomness |journal=Eur.

The temporal structure of a spike train or firing rate evoked by a stimulus is determined both by the dynamics of the stimulus and by the nature of the neural encoding process. Stimuli that change rapidly tend to generate precisely timed spikes and rapidly changing firing rates no matter what neural coding strategy is being used. Temporal coding refers to temporal precision in the response that does not arise solely from the dynamics of the stimulus, but that nevertheless relates to properties of the stimulus. The interplay between stimulus and encoding dynamics makes the identification of a temporal code difficult.

In temporal coding, learning can be explained by activity-dependent synaptic delay modifications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Geoffrois |first1=E. |last2=Edeline |first2=J.M. |last3=Vibert |first3=J.F. |chapter=Learning by Delay Modifications |editor-first=Frank H. |editor-last=Eeckman |title=Computation in Neurons and Neural Systems |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=S4ek3S6fDRUC&amp;pg=PA133 |year=1994 |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-0-7923-9465-5 |pages=133–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The modifications can themselves depend not only on spike rates (rate coding) but also on spike timing patterns (temporal coding), i.e., can be a special case of [[spike-timing-dependent plasticity]].&lt;ref&gt;Sjöström, Jesper, and Wulfram Gerstner. "Spike-timing dependent plasticity." Spike-timing dependent plasticity 35 (2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

The issue of temporal coding is distinct and independent from the issue of independent-spike coding. If each spike is independent of all the other spikes in the train, the temporal character of the neural code is determined by the behavior of time-dependent firing rate r(t). If r(t) varies slowly with time, the code is typically called a rate code, and if it varies rapidly, the code is called temporal.

==== Temporal coding in sensory systems ====
For very brief stimuli, a neuron's maximum firing rate may not be fast enough to produce more than a single spike. Due to the density of information about the abbreviated stimulus contained in this single spike, it would seem that the timing of the spike itself would have to convey more information than simply the average frequency of action potentials over a given period of time. This model is especially important for [[sound localization]], which occurs within the brain on the order of milliseconds. The brain must obtain a large quantity of information based on a relatively short neural response. Additionally, if low firing rates on the order of ten spikes per second must be distinguished from arbitrarily close rate coding for different stimuli, then a neuron trying to discriminate these two stimuli may need to wait for a second or more to accumulate enough information. This is not consistent with numerous organisms which are able to discriminate between stimuli in the time frame of milliseconds, suggesting that a rate code is not the only model at work.&lt;ref name="Theunissen F 1995"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Theunissen | first1 = F | last2 = Miller | first2 = JP | year = 1995 | title = Temporal Encoding in Nervous Systems: A Rigorous Definition | url = | journal = Journal of Computational Neuroscience | volume = 2 | issue = 2| pages = 149–162 | doi=10.1007/bf00961885}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To account for the fast encoding of visual stimuli, it has been suggested that neurons of the retina encode visual information in the latency time between stimulus onset and first action potential, also called latency to first spike.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gollisch|first=T.|author2=Meister, M.|title=Rapid Neural Coding in the Retina with Relative Spike Latencies|journal=Science|date=22 February 2008|volume=319|issue=5866|pages=1108–1111|doi=10.1126/science.1149639|pmid=18292344|bibcode=2008Sci...319.1108G}}&lt;/ref&gt; This type of temporal coding has been shown also in the auditory and somato-sensory system. The main drawback of such a coding scheme is its sensitivity to intrinsic neuronal fluctuations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wainrib|first=Gilles|author2=Michèle, Thieullen |author3=Khashayar, Pakdaman |title=Intrinsic variability of latency to first-spike|journal=Biological Cybernetics|date=7 April 2010|volume=103|issue=1|pages=43–56|doi=10.1007/s00422-010-0384-8|pmid=20372920}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Visual cortex#Primary visual cortex (V1)|primary visual cortex]] of macaques, the timing of the first spike relative to the start of the stimulus was found to provide more information than the interval between spikes. However, the interspike interval could be used to encode additional information, which is especially important when the spike rate reaches its limit, as in high-contrast situations. For this reason, temporal coding may play a part in coding defined edges rather than gradual transitions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Victor | first1 = Johnathan D | year = 2005 | title = Spike train metrics | doi = 10.1016/j.conb.2005.08.002 | pmid = 16140522 | journal = Current Opinion in Neurobiology | volume = 15 | issue = 5| pages = 585–592 | pmc = 2713191 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mammalian [[gustatory system]] is useful for studying temporal coding because of its fairly distinct stimuli and the easily discernible responses of the organism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hallock | first1 = Robert M. | last2 = Di Lorenzo | first2 = Patricia M. | year = 2006 | title = Temporal coding in the gustatory system | doi = 10.1016/j.neubiorev.2006.07.005 | pmid = 16979239 | journal = Neuroscience &amp; Biobehavioral Reviews | volume = 30 | issue = 8| pages = 1145–1160 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Temporally encoded information may help an organism discriminate between different tastants of the same category (sweet, bitter, sour, salty, umami) that elicit very similar responses in terms of spike count. The temporal component of the pattern elicited by each tastant may be used to determine its identity (e.g., the difference between two bitter tastants, such as quinine and denatonium). In this way, both rate coding and temporal coding may be used in the gustatory system – rate for basic tastant type, temporal for more specific differentiation.&lt;ref name="Carleton A 2010"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Carleton | first1 = Alan | last2 = Accolla | first2 = Riccardo | last3 = Simon | first3 = Sidney A. | year = 2010 | title = Coding in the mammalian gustatory system | doi = 10.1016/j.tins.2010.04.002 | pmid = 20493563 | journal = Trends in Neurosciences | volume = 33 | issue = 7| pages = 326–334 | pmc = 2902637 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Research on mammalian gustatory system has shown that there is an abundance of information present in temporal patterns across populations of neurons, and this information is different from that which is determined by rate coding schemes. Groups of neurons may synchronize in response to a stimulus. In studies dealing with the front cortical portion of the brain in primates, precise patterns with short time scales only a few milliseconds in length were found across small populations of neurons which correlated with certain information processing behaviors. However, little information could be determined from the patterns; one possible theory is they represented the higher-order processing taking place in the brain.&lt;ref name="Zador, Stevens"/&gt;

As with the visual system, in [[mitral cell|mitral/tufted cells]] in the [[olfactory bulb]] of mice, first-spike latency relative to the start of a sniffing action seemed to encode much of the information about an odor. This strategy of using spike latency allows for rapid identification of and reaction to an odorant. In addition, some mitral/tufted cells have specific firing patterns for given odorants. This type of extra information could help in recognizing a certain odor, but is not completely necessary, as average spike count over the course of the animal's sniffing was also a good identifier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wilson | first1 = Rachel I | year = 2008 | title = Neural and behavioral mechanisms of olfactory perception | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959438808000883 | journal = Current Opinion in Neurobiology | volume = 18 | issue = 4| pages = 408–412 | doi=10.1016/j.conb.2008.08.015| pmid = 18809492 | pmc = 2596880 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Along the same lines, experiments done with the olfactory system of rabbits showed distinct patterns which correlated with different subsets of odorants, and a similar result was obtained in experiments with the locust olfactory system.&lt;ref name="Theunissen F 1995"/&gt;

==== Temporal coding applications ====
The specificity of temporal coding requires highly refined technology to measure informative, reliable, experimental data. Advances made in [[optogenetics]] allow neurologists to control spikes in individual neurons, offering electrical and spatial single-cell resolution. For example, blue light causes the light-gated ion channel [[channelrhodopsin]] to open, depolarizing the cell and producing a spike. When blue light is not sensed by the cell, the channel closes, and the neuron ceases to spike. The pattern of the spikes matches the pattern of the blue light stimuli. By inserting channelrhodopsin gene sequences into mouse DNA, researchers can control spikes and therefore certain behaviors of the mouse (e.g., making the mouse turn left).&lt;ref name="youtube.com"&gt;Karl Diesseroth, Lecture. "Personal Growth Series: Karl Diesseroth on Cracking the Neural Code." Google Tech Talks. November 21, 2008. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SLdSbp6VjM&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers, through optogenetics, have the tools to effect different temporal codes in a neuron while maintaining the same mean firing rate, and thereby can test whether or not temporal coding occurs in specific neural circuits.&lt;ref name="Han X 2009"&gt;Han X, Qian X, Stern P, Chuong AS, Boyden ES. "Informational lesions: optical perturbations of spike timing and neural synchrony via microbial opsin gene fusions."  Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT Media Lad, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Optogenetic technology also has the potential to enable the correction of spike abnormalities at the root of several neurological and psychological disorders.&lt;ref name="Han X 2009"/&gt; If neurons do encode information in individual spike timing patterns, key signals could be missed by attempting to crack the code while looking only at mean firing rates.&lt;ref name="Theunissen F 1995"/&gt; Understanding any temporally encoded aspects of the neural code and replicating these sequences in neurons could allow for greater control and treatment of neurological disorders such as  [[depression (mood)|depression]], [[schizophrenia]], and [[Parkinson's disease]]. Regulation of spike intervals in single cells more precisely controls brain activity than the addition of pharmacological agents intravenously.&lt;ref name="youtube.com"/&gt;

==== Phase-of-firing code ====
{{main|Phase precession}}
{{further|Phase resetting in neurons}}
Phase-of-firing code is a neural coding scheme that combines the [[action potential|spike]] count code with a time reference based on [[Neural oscillations|oscillations]]. This type of code takes into account a time label for each spike according to a time reference based on phase of local ongoing oscillations at low&lt;ref name="Montemurro" /&gt; or high frequencies.&lt;ref name="Gamma cycle"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Fries P, Nikolić D, Singer W |title=The gamma cycle |journal=Trends Neurosci. |volume=30 |issue=7 |pages=309–16 |date=July 2007 |pmid=17555828 |doi=10.1016/j.tins.2007.05.005 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0166-2236(07)00124-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been shown that neurons in some cortical sensory areas encode rich naturalistic stimuli in terms of their spike times relative to the phase of ongoing  network oscillatory fluctuations, rather than only in terms of their spike count.&lt;ref name="Montemurro"&gt;Marcelo A. Montemurro, Malte J. Rasch, Yusuke Murayama, [[Nikos Logothetis|Nikos K.

The phase-of-firing code is often categorized as a temporal code although the time label used for spikes (i.e. the network oscillation phase) is a low-resolution (coarse-grained) reference for time. As a result, often only four discrete values for the phase are enough to represent all the information content in this kind of code with respect to the phase of oscillations in low frequencies. Phase-of-firing code is loosely based on the [[Place cell#Phase precession|phase precession]] phenomena observed in place cells of the [[hippocampus]]. Another feature of this code is that neurons adhere to a preferred order of spiking between a group of sensory neurons, resulting in firing sequence.&lt;ref name="Firing sequences"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Havenith MN, Yu S, Biederlack J, Chen NH, Singer W, Nikolić D |title=Synchrony makes neurons fire in sequence, and stimulus properties determine who is ahead |journal=J.

Phase code has been shown in visual cortex to involve also high-frequency oscillations.&lt;ref name="Firing sequences" /&gt; Within a cycle of gamma oscillation, each neuron has its own preferred relative firing time. As a result, an entire population of neurons generates a firing sequence that has a duration of up to about 15 ms.&lt;ref name="Firing sequences"/&gt;

=== Population coding ===
Population coding is a method to represent stimuli by using the joint activities of a number of neurons. In population coding, each neuron has a distribution of responses over some set of inputs, and the responses of many neurons may be combined to determine some value about the inputs.

From the theoretical point of view, population coding is one of a few mathematically well-formulated problems in neuroscience. It grasps the essential features of neural coding and yet is simple enough for theoretic analysis.&lt;ref name="Wu"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Wu S, Amari S, Nakahara H |title=Population coding and decoding in a neural field: a computational study |journal=Neural Comput |volume=14 |issue=5 |pages=999–1026 |date=May 2002 |pmid=11972905 |doi=10.1162/089976602753633367 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Experimental studies have revealed that this coding paradigm is widely used in the sensor and motor areas of the brain. For example, in the visual area [[Medial temporal lobe|medial temporal]] (MT), neurons are tuned to the moving direction.&lt;ref name="Maunsell"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Maunsell JH, Van Essen DC |title=Functional properties of neurons in middle temporal visual area of the macaque monkey. I. Selectivity for stimulus direction, speed, and orientation |journal=J. Neurophysiol. |volume=49 |issue=5 |pages=1127–47 |date=May 1983 |pmid=6864242 |url=http://jn.physiology.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=6864242|doi=10.1152/jn.1983.49.5.1127 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to an object moving in a particular direction, many neurons in MT fire with a noise-corrupted and [[Normal distribution|bell-shaped]] activity pattern across the population. The moving direction of the object is retrieved from the population activity, to be immune from the fluctuation existing in a single neuron’s signal.
In one classic example in the primary motor cortex, Apostolos Georgopoulos and colleagues trained monkeys to move a joystick towards a lit target.&lt;ref&gt;[http://homepage.psy.utexas.edu/homepage/class/psy394U/hayhoe/IntroSensoryMotorSystems/week6/Ch38.pdf Intro to Sensory Motor Systems Ch. 38 page 766]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Science. 1986 Sep 26;233(4771):1416-9&lt;/ref&gt; They found that a single neuron would fire for multiple target directions. However it would fire fastest for one direction and more slowly depending on how close the target was to the neuron's 'preferred' direction.

Kenneth Johnson originally derived that if each neuron represents movement in its preferred direction, and the vector sum of all neurons is calculated (each neuron has a firing rate and a preferred direction), the sum points in the direction of motion. In this manner, the population of neurons codes the signal for the motion. This particular population code is referred to as [[population vector]] coding.  This particular study divided the field of motor physiologists between Evarts' "upper motor neuron" group, which followed the hypothesis that motor cortex neurons contributed to control of single muscles, and the Georgopoulos group studying the representation of movement directions in cortex. {{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

The Johns Hopkins University Neural Encoding laboratory led by Murray Sachs and Eric Young developed place-time population codes, termed the Averaged-Localized-Synchronized-Response (ALSR) code
for neural representation of auditory acoustic stimuli. This exploits both the place or tuning within the auditory nerve, as well as the phase-locking within each nerve fiber Auditory nerve.
The first ALSR representation was for steady-state vowels;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sachs|first1=Murray B.|last2=Young|first2=Eric D.|title=Representation of steady-state vowels in the temporal aspects of the discharge patterns of populations of auditory-nerve fibers|journal=JASA|date=November 1979|volume=66|issue=5|pages=1381–1403}}&lt;/ref&gt;
ALSR representations of pitch and formant frequencies in complex, non-steady state stimuli
were demonstrated for voiced-pitch&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Miller|first1=M.I.|last2=Sachs|first2=M.B.|title=Representation of voice pitch in discharge patterns of auditory-nerve fibers|journal=Hearing Research|date=June 1984|volume=14|issue=3|pages=257–279|pmid=6480513|doi=10.1016/0378-5955(84)90054-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; and formant representations in consonant-vowel syllables.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Miller|first1=M.I.|last2=Sachs|first2=M.B.|title=Representation of stop consonants in the discharge patterns of auditory-nerve fibrers|journal=JASA|date=1983|volume=74|issue=2|pages=502–517|doi=10.1121/1.389816|bibcode=1983ASAJ...74..502M}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The advantage of such representations is that global features such as pitch or formant transition profiles can be represented as global features across the entire nerve simultaneously via both
rate and place coding.

Population coding has a number of other advantages as well, including reduction of uncertainty due to neuronal [[Statistical variability|variability]] and the ability to represent a number of different stimulus attributes simultaneously. Population coding is also much faster than rate coding and can reflect changes in the stimulus conditions nearly instantaneously.&lt;ref name="Hubel"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hubel DH, Wiesel TN |title=Receptive fields of single neurones in the cat's striate cortex |journal=J. Physiol. |volume=148 |issue= 3|pages=574–91 |date=October 1959 |pmid=14403679 |pmc=1363130 |url=http://www.jphysiol.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=14403679 |doi=10.1113/jphysiol.1959.sp006308}}&lt;/ref&gt; Individual neurons in such a population typically have different but overlapping selectivities, so that many neurons, but not necessarily all, respond to a given stimulus.

Typically an encoding function has a peak value such that activity of the neuron is greatest if the perceptual value is close to the peak value, and becomes reduced accordingly for values less close to the peak value. {{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

It follows that the actual perceived value can be reconstructed from the overall pattern of activity in the set of neurons. The Johnson/Georgopoulos vector coding is an example of simple averaging. A more sophisticated mathematical technique for performing such a reconstruction is the method of [[maximum likelihood]] based on a multivariate distribution of the neuronal responses. These models can assume independence, second order correlations

====Correlation coding====
The correlation coding model of [[neuron]]al firing claims that correlations between [[action potential]]s, or "spikes", within a spike train may carry additional information above and beyond the simple timing of the spikes. Early work suggested that correlation between spike trains can only reduce, and never increase, the total [[mutual information]] present in the two spike trains about a stimulus feature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Johnson | first1 = KO | date = Jun 1980 | title = Sensory discrimination: neural processes preceding discrimination decision | journal = J Neurophysiol | volume = 43 | issue = 6| pages = 1793–815 | pmid=7411183| doi = 10.1152/jn.1980.43.6.1793 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this was later demonstrated to be incorrect. Correlation structure can increase information content if noise and signal correlations are of opposite sign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Panzeri | last2 = Schultz | last3 = Treves | last4 = Rolls | year = 1999 | title =  Correlations and the encoding of information in the nervous system|pmc=1689940| doi = 10.1098/rspb.1999.0736| journal = Proc Biol Sci | volume = 266 | issue = 1423| pages = 1001–12 | pmid=10610508}}&lt;/ref&gt; Correlations can also carry information not present in the average firing rate of two pairs of neurons. A good example of this exists in the pentobarbital-anesthetized marmoset auditory cortex, in which a pure tone causes an increase in the number of correlated spikes, but not an increase in the mean firing rate, of pairs of neurons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | date = Jun 1996 | title =  Primary cortical representation of sounds by the coordination of action-potential timing| url = | journal = Nature | volume = 381 | issue = 6583| pages = 610–3 | doi=10.1038/381610a0 | pmid=8637597 | last1 = Merzenich | first1 = MM| bibcode =1996Natur.381..610D}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Position coding ====
[[File:PopulationCode.svg|thumb|Plot of typical position coding]]
A typical population code involves neurons with a Gaussian tuning curve whose means vary linearly with the stimulus intensity, meaning that the neuron responds most strongly (in terms of spikes per second) to a stimulus near the mean.  The actual intensity could be recovered as the stimulus level corresponding to the mean of the neuron with the greatest response.  However, the noise inherent in neural responses means that a maximum likelihood estimation function is more accurate.

[[File:NoisyNeuralResponse.png|thumb|Neural responses are noisy and unreliable.]]
This type of code is used to encode continuous variables such as joint position, eye position, color, or sound frequency. Any individual neuron is too noisy to faithfully encode the variable using rate coding, but an entire population ensures greater fidelity and precision. For a population of unimodal tuning curves, i.e. with a single peak, the precision typically scales linearly with the number of neurons. Hence, for half the precision, half as many neurons are required. In contrast, when the tuning curves have multiple peaks, as in [[grid cell]]s that represent space, the precision of the population can scale exponentially with the number of neurons. This greatly reduces the number of neurons required for the same precision.&lt;ref name="Mat"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Mathis A, Herz AV, Stemmler MB |title=Resolution of nested neuronal representations can be exponential in the number of neurons |journal=Phys. Rev. Lett. |volume=109 |issue=1 |pages=018103 |date=July 2012 |pmid=23031134 |url=http://link.aps.org/abstract/PRL/v109/p018103 |bibcode=2012PhRvL.109a8103M |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.109.018103}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sparse coding ===
The sparse code is when each item is encoded by the strong activation of a relatively small set of neurons. For each item to be encoded, this is a different subset of all available neurons. In contrast to sensor-sparse coding, sensor-dense coding implies that all information from possible sensor locations is known.

As a consequence, sparseness may be focused on temporal sparseness ("a relatively small number of time periods are active") or on the sparseness in an activated population of neurons. In this latter case, this may be defined in one time period as the number of activated neurons relative to the total number of neurons in the population. This seems to be a hallmark of neural computations since compared to traditional computers, information is massively distributed across neurons. A major result in neural coding from Olshausen and Field&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Olshausen | first1 = Bruno A | last2 = Field | first2 = David J | year = 1996 | title = Emergence of simple-cell receptive field properties by learning a sparse code for natural images | url = http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~little/cpsc425/olshausen_field_nature_1996.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Nature | volume = 381 | issue = 6583| pages = 607–609 | doi=10.1038/381607a0 | pmid=8637596| bibcode = 1996Natur.381..607O }}&lt;/ref&gt; is that [[sparse coding]] of natural images produces [[wavelet]]-like oriented filters that resemble the receptive fields of simple cells in the visual cortex. The capacity of sparse codes may be increased by simultaneous use of temporal coding, as found in the locust olfactory system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gupta|first1=N|last2=Stopfer|first2=M|title=A temporal channel for information in sparse sensory coding.|journal=Current Biology|date=6 October 2014|volume=24|issue=19|pages=2247–56|pmid=25264257|doi=10.1016/j.cub.2014.08.021|pmc=4189991}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Given a potentially large set of input patterns, sparse coding algorithms (e.g. [[Autoencoder#Sparse autoencoder|Sparse Autoencoder]]) attempt to automatically find a small number of representative patterns which, when combined in the right proportions, reproduce the original input patterns. The sparse coding for the input then consists of those representative patterns. For example, the very large set of English sentences can be encoded by a small number of symbols (i.e. letters, numbers, punctuation, and spaces) combined in a particular order for a particular sentence, and so a sparse coding for English would be those symbols.

==== Linear generative model ====
Most models of sparse coding are based on the linear generative model.&lt;ref name=Rehn&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Martin|last1=Rehn|first2=Friedrich T.|last2=Sommer|title=A network that uses few active neurones to code visual input predicts the diverse shapes of cortical receptive fields|journal=Journal of Computational Neuroscience|year=2007|volume=22|issue=2|pages=135–146|doi=10.1007/s10827-006-0003-9|pmid=17053994|url=http://redwood.berkeley.edu/fsommer/papers/rehnsommer07jcns.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this model, the symbols are combined in a [[Linear combination|linear fashion]] to approximate the input.

More formally, given a k-dimensional set of real-numbered input vectors &lt;math&gt;\vec{\xi }\in \mathbb{R}^{k}&lt;/math&gt;, the goal of sparse coding is to determine n k-dimensional [[Basis (linear algebra)|basis vectors]] &lt;math&gt;\vec{b_1}, \ldots, \vec{b_n} \in \mathbb{R}^{k}&lt;/math&gt; along with a [[Sparse vector|sparse]] n-dimensional vector of weights or coefficients &lt;math&gt;\vec{s} \in \mathbb{R}^{n}&lt;/math&gt; for each input vector, so that a linear combination of the basis vectors with proportions given by the coefficients results in a close approximation to the input vector: &lt;math&gt;\vec{\xi} \approx \sum_{j=1}^{n} s_{j}\vec{b}_{j}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name=Lee&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lee|first1=Honglak|last2=Battle|first2=Alexis|last3=Raina|first3=Rajat|last4=Ng|first4=Andrew Y.|title=Efficient sparse coding algorithms|journal=Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems|year=2006|url=http://ai.stanford.edu/~hllee/nips06-sparsecoding.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The codings generated by algorithms implementing a linear generative model can be classified into codings with ''soft sparseness'' and those with ''hard sparseness''.&lt;ref name=Rehn/&gt; These refer to the distribution of basis vector coefficients for typical inputs. A coding with soft sparseness has a smooth  [[Normal distribution|Gaussian]]-like distribution, but peakier than Gaussian, with many zero values, some small absolute values, fewer larger absolute values, and very few very large absolute values. Thus, many of the basis vectors are active. Hard sparseness, on the other hand, indicates that there are many zero values, ''no'' or ''hardly any'' small absolute values, fewer larger absolute values, and very few very large absolute values, and thus few of the basis vectors are active. This is appealing from a metabolic perspective: less energy is used when fewer neurons are firing.&lt;ref name=Rehn/&gt;

Another measure of coding is whether it is ''critically complete'' or ''overcomplete''. If the number of basis vectors n is equal to the dimensionality k of the input set, the coding is said to be critically complete. In this case, smooth changes in the input vector result in abrupt changes in the coefficients, and the coding is not able to gracefully handle small scalings, small translations, or noise in the inputs. If, however, the number of basis vectors is larger than the dimensionality of the input set, the coding is ''overcomplete''. Overcomplete codings smoothly interpolate between input vectors and are robust under input noise.&lt;ref name=Olshausen&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Bruno A.|last1=Olshausen|first2=David J.|last2=Field|title=Sparse Coding with an Overcomplete Basis Set: A Strategy Employed by V1?|journal=Vision Research|year=1997|volume=37|number=23|pages=3311–3325|url=http://www.chaos.gwdg.de/~michael/CNS_course_2004/papers_max/OlshausenField1997.pdf|doi=10.1016/s0042-6989(97)00169-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The human primary [[visual cortex]] is estimated to be overcomplete by a factor of 500, so that, for example, a 14 x 14 patch of input (a 196-dimensional space) is coded by roughly 100,000 neurons.&lt;ref name=Rehn/&gt;

==== Biological evidence ====
[[Sparse coding]] may be a general strategy of neural systems to augment memory capacity. To adapt to their environments, animals must learn which stimuli are associated with rewards or punishments and distinguish these reinforced stimuli from similar but irrelevant ones.  Such task requires implementing stimulus-specific [[associative memory (psychology)|associative memories]]  in which only a few neurons out of a [[Neural ensemble|population]] respond to any given stimulus and each neuron responds to only a few stimuli out of all possible stimuli.

Theoretical work on [[Sparse distributed memory]]&lt;ref&gt;Kanerva, Pentti. Sparse distributed memory. MIT press, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; has suggested that sparse coding increases the capacity of associative memory by reducing overlap between representations.  Experimentally, sparse representations of sensory information have been observed in many systems, including vision,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Vinje | first1 = WE | last2 = Gallant | first2 = JL | year = 2000 | title = Sparse coding and decorrelation in primary visual cortex during natural vision | url = | journal = Science | volume = 287 | issue = 5456| pages = 1273–1276 | pmid = 10678835 | doi=10.1126/science.287.5456.1273| bibcode = 2000Sci...287.1273V | citeseerx = 10.1.1.456.2467 }}&lt;/ref&gt; audition,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hromádka | first1 = T | last2 = Deweese | first2 = MR | last3 = Zador | first3 = AM | year = 2008 | title = Sparse representation of sounds in the unanesthetized auditory cortex | url = | journal = PLoS Biol | volume = 6 | issue = 1| page = e16 | pmid = 18232737 | doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.0060016 | pmc=2214813}}&lt;/ref&gt; touch,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Crochet | first1 = S | last2 = Poulet | first2 = JFA | last3 = Kremer | first3 = Y | last4 = Petersen | first4 = CCH | year = 2011 | title = Synaptic mechanisms underlying sparse coding of active touch | url = | journal = Neuron | volume = 69 | issue = 6| pages = 1160–1175 | pmid = 21435560 | doi=10.1016/j.neuron.2011.02.022}}&lt;/ref&gt; and olfaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ito | first1 = I | last2 = Ong | first2 = RCY | last3 = Raman | first3 = B | last4 = Stopfer | first4 = M | year = 2008 | title = Sparse odor representation and olfactory learning | url = | journal = Nat Neurosci | volume = 11 | issue = 10| pages = 1177–1184 | pmid = 18794840 | doi=10.1038/nn.2192 | pmc=3124899}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, despite the accumulating evidence for widespread sparse coding and theoretical arguments for its importance, a demonstration that sparse coding improves the stimulus-specificity of associative memory has been lacking until recently.

Some progress has been made in 2014 by [[Gero Miesenböck]]'s lab at the [[University of Oxford]] analyzing  [[Drosophila]] [[Olfactory system]].&lt;ref&gt;A sparse memory is a precise memory. Oxford Science blog. 28 Feb 2014. http://www.ox.ac.uk/news/science-blog/sparse-memory-precise-memory&lt;/ref&gt;
In Drosophila, sparse odor coding by the [[Kenyon cell]]s of the [[Mushroom bodies|mushroom body]] is thought to generate a large number of precisely addressable locations for the storage of odor-specific memories. Lin et al.&lt;ref&gt;Lin, Andrew C., et al. "Sparse, decorrelated odor coding in the mushroom body enhances learned odor discrimination." Nature Neuroscience 17.4 (2014): 559-568.&lt;/ref&gt; demonstrated that sparseness is controlled by a negative feedback circuit between Kenyon cells and the [[GABAergic]] anterior paired lateral (APL) neuron. Systematic activation and blockade of each leg of this feedback circuit show that Kenyon cells activate APL and APL inhibits Kenyon cells. Disrupting the Kenyon cell-APL feedback loop decreases the sparseness of Kenyon cell odor responses, increases inter-odor correlations, and prevents flies from learning to discriminate similar, but not dissimilar, odors. These results suggest that feedback inhibition suppresses Kenyon cell activity to maintain sparse, decorrelated odor coding and thus the odor-specificity of memories.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3054">'''Ole Lund''' '''Kirkegaard''' (29 July 1940, [[Aarhus]] &amp;mdash; 24 March 1979) was a [[Denmark|Danish]] writer of [[children's literature]] and [[Young adult literature|youth literature]] and a teacher. He mainly wrote about the interaction between [[adult]] and [[child]]. The main character in his books is usually an [[anti-hero]]. In 1969 he was awarded with the Danish [[Ministry of Culture's children book prize (Denmark)|Ministry of Culture's children book prize (Denmark) (Kulturministeriets Børnebogspris)]] &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kunststyrelsen.dk/db/files/modtagere_boernebog.pdf Kunststyrelsen.dk] List of recipients of the Kulturministeriets Børnebogspris&lt;/ref&gt;

Kirkegaard grew up in [[Skanderborg]] just south of Aarhus and many of his stories were inspired by his own childhood experiences there. He also illustrated his own books. On a cold winter night in 1979 Kirkegaard, on his way home, fell in the snow and could not get up again, after having had too much to drink. He froze to death on location, at just 38 years of age. The street of Ole Lund Kirkegaards Stræde in Skanderborg, is named after him.

In biology, '''placentation''' refers to the formation, type and structure, or arrangement of the [[placenta]]. The function of placentation is to transfer nutrients, respiratory gases, and water from maternal tissue to a growing [[embryo]], and in some instances to remove waste from the embryo. Placentation is best known in [[Viviparity|live-bearing]] [[mammals]] ([[theria]]), but also occurs in some fish, reptiles, amphibians, a diversity of invertebrates, and [[flowering plant]]s. In vertebrates, placentas have evolved more than 100 times independently, with the majority of these instances occurring in [[squamate]] reptiles.

The placenta can be defined as an organ formed by the sustained apposition or fusion of fetal membranes and parental tissue for physiological exchange.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This definition is modified from the original Mossman (1937)&lt;ref&gt;Mossman, H. Comparative Morphogenesis of the Fetal Membranes and Accessory Uterine Structures Vol. 26 (Carnegie Institution of Washington, 1937).&lt;/ref&gt; definition, which constrained placentation in animals to only those instances where it occurred in the uterus.

==In mammals==
{{Further|Placenta}}
In live bearing mammals, the placenta forms after the embryo implants into the wall of the [[uterus]]. The developing [[fetus]] is connected to the placenta via an [[umbilical cord]]. Mammalian placentas can be classified based on the number of tissues separating the maternal from the fetal blood. These include:
* '''endotheliochorial placentation''' 
In this type of placentation, the [[chorionic villi]] are in contact with the endothelium of maternal blood vessels.  (e.g. in most [[carnivore]]s like [[cat]]s and [[dog]]s)
* '''epitheliochorial placentation''' 
Chorionic villi, growing into the apertures of uterine glands ( epithelium). (e.g. in [[ruminant]]s, [[horse]]s, [[whale]]s, [[Strepsirrhini|lower primates]], [[dugong]]s)
* '''hemochorial placentation''' (e.g. in [[Catarrhini|higher order primates]], including [[human]]s, and also in  [[rabbit]]s, [[guinea pig]]s, [[mice]], and [[rats]])&lt;ref&gt;Claim for guinea pigs, rabbits, mice, and rats taken from: {{cite journal |author=Thornburg KL, Faber JJ |title=The steady state concentration gradients of an electron-dense marker (ferritin) in the three-layered hemochorial placenta of the rabbit |journal=J.

In hemochorial placentation maternal blood comes in direct contact with the fetal [[chorion]], which it does not in the other two types.&lt;ref&gt;[http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/hemochorial+placenta thefreedictionary.com &gt; hemochorial placenta] Citing: Dorland's Medical Dictionary for Health Consumers.

During [[pregnancy]], placentation is the formation and growth of the placenta inside the uterus. It occurs after the implantation of the embryo into the uterine wall and involves the remodeling of [[blood vessel]]s in order to supply the needed amount of blood. In humans, placentation takes place 7–8 days after fertilization.

In humans, the placenta develops in the following manner. Chorionic villi (from the embryo) on the embryonic pole grow, forming chorion frondosum. Villi on the opposite side (abembryonic pole) degenerate and form the chorion laeve (or chorionic laevae), a smooth surface. The endometrium (from the mother) over the chorion frondosum (this part of the endometrium is called the decidua basalis) forms the decidual plate. The decidual plate is tightly attached to the chorion frondosum and goes on to form the actual placenta. Endometrium on the opposite side to the decidua basalis is the decidua parietalis. This fuses with the chorion laevae, thus filling up the uterine cavity.&lt;ref&gt;T.W. Sadler, Langman's Medical Embryology, 11th edition, Lippincott &amp; Wilkins&lt;/ref&gt;

In the case of [[twin]]s, '''dichorionic placentation''' refers to the presence of two placentas (in all [[dizygotic]] and some [[monozygotic]] twins). '''Monochorionic placentation''' occurs when monozygotic twins develop with only one placenta and bears a higher risk of complications during pregnancy. Abnormal placentation can lead to an early termination of pregnancy, for example in [[pre-eclampsia]].

==In lizards and snakes==
As placentation often results during the evolution of live birth, the more than 100 origins of live birth in lizards and snakes (Squamata) have seen close to an equal number of independent origins of placentation. This means that the occurrence of placentation in [[squamata]] is more frequent than in all other vertebrates combined,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Blackburn | first1 = DG | last2 = Flemming | first2 = AF | year = 2009 | title = Morphology, development, and evolution of fetal membranes and placentation in squamate reptiles | url = | journal = J.

In most squamates two separate placentae form, utilising separate embryonic tissue (the chorioallantoic and yolk-sac placentae).

Most reptiles exhibit strict epitheliochorial placentation (e.g. ''[[Pseudemoia entrecasteauxii]])'' however at least two examples of endotheliochorial placentation have been identified ([[Mabuya mabouya|''Mabuya'']]'' sp.'' and ''[[Trachylepis ivensi]]'').&lt;ref&gt;Blackburn, D.

The genetic processes that support the evolution of the placenta can be best understood by separating those that result in the evolution of new structures within the animal and those that result in the evolution of new functions within the placenta.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Evolution of placental structures'''

In all placental animals, placentas have evolved through the utilisation of existing tissues.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In viviparous mammals and reptiles placentas form from the intimate interaction of the uterus and a series of embryonic membranes including the chorioallantoic and yolk sac membranes. In guppies placental tissues form between the ovarian tissue and the egg membrane. In pipefish placentas form following the interaction with the egg and the skin.

Despite the placenta forming from pre-existing tissues, in many instances new structures can evolve within these pre-existing tissues. For example, in male seahorses the underbelly skin has become highly modified to form a pouch in which embryos can develop. In mammals and some reptiles, including the viviparous [[southern grass skink]], the uterus becomes regionally specialised to support placental functions, within each of these regions being a new specialised uterine structure. In the southern grass skink three distinct regions of the placenta form which likely perform different functions; the placentome supports nutrient transfer via membrane bound transport proteins, the paraplacentome supports the exchange of respiratory gasses, and the yolk sac placenta supports lipid transport via apocrine secretion.&lt;ref name="Griffith, OW 2016"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Griffith | first1 = OW | last2 = Ujvari | first2 = B | last3 = Belov | first3 = K | last4 = Thompson | first4 = MB | year = 2013 | title = Placental lipoprotein lipase (LPL) gene expression in a placentotrophic lizard, Pseudemoia entrecasteauxii | url = | journal = J Exp Zool B | volume = 320 | issue = 7| pages = 465–470 | doi = 10.1002/jez.b.22526 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Evolution of placental functions'''

Placental functions include nutrient transport, gas exchange, maternal-fetal communication, and waste removal from the embryo.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; These functions have evolved by a series of general processes such as re-purposing processes found in the ancestral tissues from which a placenta is derived, recruiting the expression of genes expressed elsewhere in the organism to perform new functions in placental tissues, and the evolution of new molecular processes following the formation of new placenta specific genes.

In mammals, maternal-fetal communication occurs via the production of a range of signalling molecules and their receptors in the chorioallantoic membrane of the embryo and the endometrium of the mother. Examination of these tissues in egg-laying and other independently evolved live bearing vertebrates has shown us that many of these signalling molecules are expressed widely in vertebrate species and were probably expressed in the ancestral amniote vertebrate.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; This suggests that maternal fetal communication has evolved by utilising the existing signalling molecules and their receptors, from which placental tissues are derived.

==In plants==
{{main|Ovule}}
[[File:Gynoecium morphology placentation axilar with intrusive placenta cross section.png|thumb|
Axile placentation
]]
In [[flowering plant]]s, placentation occurs where the [[ovule]]s are attached inside the [[ovary (plants)|ovary]].&lt;ref name="hamburg-botany-online"&gt;"Flowers" At: ''Botany Online'' At: University of Hamburg Department of Biology. (see ''External links'' below).&lt;/ref&gt;  The ovules inside a [[flower]]'s ovary (which later become the [[seed]]s inside a [[fruit]]) are attached via '''funiculi''', the plant part equivalent to an umbilical cord. The part of the ovary where the funiculus attaches is referred to as the '''placenta'''.

In botany, the term placentation most commonly refers to the arrangement of placentas inside a flower or fruit. Plant placentation types include:
*'''Basal placentation''': The placenta is found in mono to multi carpellary, syncarpous ovary. usually a single ovary is produced at the base (bottom).
Eg: Helianthus, Tridex, tagetus.
*'''Apical placentation''': 
*'''Parietal placentation''': It is found in bicarpellary to multicarpellary syncarpous ovary.
unilocular ovary becomes bilocular due to formation of false septum.
*'''Axile placentation''': it is found in bicarpellary to multicarpellary syncarpous ovary.
the carpels fuse to form septa forming a central axis and ovules are arranged on the axis.
Eg: Hybiscus , lemon, tomato , lilium.
*'''Free or central placentation''': It is found in bicarpellary to multicarpellary syncarpous ovary.
due to degradation of false septum unilocular condition is formed and ovules are arranged on the central axis.
Eg: Dianthus , Primula
*'''Marginal placentation''': It is found in monocarpellary unilocular ovary , placenta forms a rigid along ventral side and ovules are arranged in two vertical rows.
Eg: Pea (Pisum Sativam)

'''Posterior cortical atrophy''' ('''PCA'''), also called '''Benson's syndrome''', is a form of [[dementia]] which is usually considered an atypical variant of [[Alzheimer's disease]] (AD).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://eyewiki.aao.org/Visual_variant_of_Alzheimer%E2%80%99s_disease|title=Visual variant of Alzheimer’s disease - EyeWiki|website=eyewiki.aao.org|language=en|access-date=2017-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Nestor PJ, Caine D, Fryer TD, Clarke J, Hodges JR | year = 2003 | title = The topography of metabolic deficits in posterior cortical atrophy (the visual variant of Alzheimer's disease) with FDG-PET | url = http://jnnp.bmj.com/cgi/content/abstract/74/11/1521?ijkey=c324f6cfb6032c6e43e57b25d351e40cd607348e&amp;keytype2=tf_ipsecsha | journal = J Neurol Neurosurg Psychiatry | volume = 74 | issue = | pages = 1521–1529 | doi=10.1136/jnnp.74.11.1521| pmc = 1738241 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The disease causes [[atrophy]] of the [[Posterior (anatomy)|posterior]] part of the [[cerebral cortex]], resulting in the progressive disruption of complex visual processing.&lt;ref name="ucsf"&gt;{{cite web| url= http://memory.ucsf.edu/education/diseases/pca | title=Posterior Cortical Atrophy | work= UCSF Memory and Aging Center| publisher= [[University of California, San Francisco]] | accessdate= 2011-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; PCA was first described by D.

In rare cases, PCA can be caused by [[dementia with Lewy bodies]] and [[Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease]].&lt;ref name="nmrharv"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ucsf"/&gt;

PCA usually affects people at an earlier age than typical cases of Alzheimer's disease, with initial symptoms often experienced in people in their mid-fifties or early sixties.&lt;ref name="ucsf"/&gt;  This was the case with writer [[Terry Pratchett]] (1948-2015), who went public in 2007 about being diagnosed with PCA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alzheimersresearchuk.org/terry-pratchett-donates-one-million/ |title=Terry Pratchett pledges $1 million to Alzheimer's research |publisher=[[Alzheimer's Research Trust]] |date=2011-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[The Mind's Eye (book)|The Mind's Eye]]'', neurologist [[Oliver Sacks]] examines the case of concert pianist [[Lilian Kallir]] (1931–2004), who suffered from PCA.

==Symptoms==

The main symptom resulting from PCA is a decrease in visuospatial and visuoperceptual capabilities.&lt;ref name="Mendez 2002 33–40"/&gt;  Because the posterior region of the brain is home to the [[occipital lobe]], which is responsible for visual processing, visual functions are impaired in PCA patients.

As [[neurodegeneration]] spreads, more severe symptoms emerge, including the inability to recognize familiar people and objects, trouble navigating familiar places, and sometimes visual hallucinations.&lt;ref name="Mendez 2002 33–40"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Crutch 2012 170–178"/&gt;  In addition, patients may experience difficulty making guiding movements towards objects, and may experience a decline in literacy skills including reading, writing, and spelling.&lt;ref name="Crutch 2012 170–178"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Crutch 2013 463–465"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tsunoda|first=Ayami|author2=Shuji Iritani |author3=Norio Ozaki |title=Presenile dementia diagnosed as posterior cortical atrophy|journal=Psychogeriatrics|date=17 March 2011|volume=11|pages=171–176|doi=10.1111/j.1479-8301.2011.00366.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Furthermore, if neural death spreads into other anterior cortical regions, symptoms similar to [[Alzheimer's disease]], such as memory loss, may result.&lt;ref name="Crutch 2012 170–178"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Crutch 2013 463–465"/&gt;  PCA patients with significant [[atrophy]] in one hemisphere of the brain may experience [[hemispatial neglect]], the inability to see stimuli on one half of the visual field.&lt;ref name="Borruat 2013" /&gt; [[Anxiety]] and [[depression (mood)|depression]] are also common in PCA patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Crutch|first=Sebastian|author2=Manja Lehmann |author3=Jonathan Schott |author4=Gil Rabinovici |author5=Martin Rosser |author6=Nick Fox |title=Posterior cortical atrophy|journal=The Lancet Neurology|date=February 2012|volume=11|pages=170–178|doi=10.1016/s1474-4422(11)70289-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diagnosis==

At this time the cause of PCA is unknown; similarly, there are no fully accepted diagnostic criteria for the disease.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Borruat 2013" /&gt; This is partially due to the gradual onset of PCA symptoms, the variety of symptoms, the rare nature of the disease and younger age of patients (initial symptoms appear in patients of 50–60 years old).&lt;ref name="middlebury.edu"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Crutch|first=Sebastian J.|author2=Manja Lehmann |author3=Jonathan M. Schott |author4=Gil D. Rabinovici |author5=Martin N. Rossor |author6=Nick C. Fox |title=Posterior Cortical Atrophy|journal=The Lancet Neurology|date=February 2012|volume=11|issue=2|pages=170–178|doi=10.1016/s1474-4422(11)70289-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, the first international conference on PCA was held in Vancouver, Canada.  Continued research and testing will hopefully result in accepted and standardized criteria for diagnosis.&lt;ref name="Borruat 2013" /&gt;

PCA patients are often initially misdiagnosed with an [[anxiety disorder]] or [[Depression (mood)|depression]]. Some believe that patients may experience depression or anxiety due to their awareness of their symptoms, such as decrease in their vision capabilities, yet they are unable to control this decline in their vision or the progressive nature of the disease. The early visual impairments of a PCA patient have often led to an incorrect referral to an [[Ophthalmology|ophthalmologist]], which can result in unnecessary cataract surgery.&lt;ref name="middlebury.edu"/&gt;

Due to the lack of biological marks of PCA, neuropsychological examinations should be used for diagnosis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Croisile|first=MD. Bernard|author2=Alexis Brice|journal=Orphanet Encyclopedia|date=September 2004|url=https://www.orpha.net/data/patho/GB/uk-Benson.pdf|accessdate=11 November 2013|title=Benson's syndrome or Posterior Cortical Atrophy}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Neuroimaging]] can also assist in diagnosis of PCA.&lt;ref name="middlebury.edu"/&gt; The common tools used for Neuroimaging of both PCA and AD patients are [[magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI's), a popular form of medical imaging that uses magnetic fields and radio waves, as well as [[single-photon emission computed tomography]], an imaging form that uses gamma rays, and [[positron emission tomography]], another imaging tool that creates 3D images with a pair of gamma rays and a tracer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Goldstein|first=Martin A. |author2=Iliyan Ivanov |author3=Michael E. Silverman|title=Posterior Cortical Atrophy: An Exemplar for Renovating Diagnostic Formulation in Neurosychiaty|journal=Comprehensive Psychiatry|date=May 2011|volume=52|issue=3|pages=326–333|doi=10.1016/j.comppsych.2010.06.013|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010440X10000830|accessdate=11 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Images of PCA patient’s brains are often compared to AD patient images to assist diagnosis. Due to the early onset of PCA in comparison to AD, images taken at the early stages of the disease will vary from brain images of AD patients. At this early stage PCA patients will show brain [[atrophy]] more centrally located in the right [[Posterior lobe of cerebellum|posterior lobe]] and occipital gyrus, while AD brain images show the majority of atrophy in the medial [[Temporal lobe|temporal cortex]]. This variation within the images will assist in early diagnosis of PCA; however, as the years go on the images will become increasingly similar, due to the majority of PCA patients also having AD later in life because of continued brain [[atrophy]].&lt;ref name="Borruat 2013" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Möller C, van der Flier WM, Versteeg A, Benedictus MR, Wattjes MP, Koedam EL, Scheltens P, Barkhof F, Vrenken H|title=Quantitative Regional Validation of the Visual Rating Scale for Posterior Cortical Atrophy|journal=European Radiology|year=Feb 2014|volume=24|issue=2|pages=397–404|doi=10.1007/s00330-013-3025-5|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00330-013-3025-5|pmid=24092044}}&lt;/ref&gt; A key aspect found through brain imaging of PCA patients is a loss of [[grey matter]] (collections of neuronal cell bodies) in the posterior and occipital temporal cortices within the right hemisphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Migliaccio R, Agosta F, Toba MN, Samri D, Corlier F, de Souza LC, Chupin M, Sharman M, Gorno-Tempini ML, Dubois B, Filippi M, Bartolomeo P|title=Brain Networks in Posterior Cortical Atrophy: A Single Case Tractography Study and Literature Review|journal=Cortex|date=November 2012|volume=48|issue=10|pages=1298–1309|doi=10.1016/j.cortex.2011.10.002|pmid=22099855|pmc=4813795}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For some PCA patients, neuroimaging may not result with a clear diagnosis; therefore, careful observation of the patient in relation to PCA symptoms can also assist in the diagnosis of the patient.&lt;ref name="middlebury.edu"/&gt; The variation and lack of organized clinical testing has led to continued difficulties and delays in the diagnosis of PCA in patients.&lt;ref name="Borruat 2013" /&gt;

==Treatment==
Specific and accepted scientific treatment for PCA has yet to be discovered; this may be due to the rarity and variations of the disease.&lt;ref name="Borruat 2013" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Caine|first=Diana|title=Posterior Cortical Atrophy: A Review of the Literature|journal=Neurocase|year=2004|volume=10|issue=5|pages=382–385|doi=10.1080/13554790490892239|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13554790490892239#preview|accessdate=10 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At times PCA patients are treated with prescriptions originally created for treatment of AD such as, cholinesterase inhibitors, [[Donepezil]], [[Rivastigmine]] and [[Galantamine]], and [[Memantine]].&lt;ref name="Borruat 2013" /&gt; Antidepressant drugs have also provided some positive effects.&lt;ref name="middlebury.edu"/&gt;

Patients may find success with non-prescription treatments such as psychological treatments. PCA patients may find assistance in meeting with an occupational therapist or sensory team for aid in adapting to the PCA symptoms, especially for visual changes.&lt;ref name="Borruat 2013" /&gt;&lt;ref name="middlebury.edu"/&gt; People with PCA and their caregivers are likely to have different needs to more typical cases of Alzheimer's disease, and may benefit from specialized support groups such as the [http://www.raredementiasupport.org/pca/ PCA Support Group] based at [[University College London]], or other groups for young people with dementia. No study to date has been definitive to provide accepted conclusive analysis on treatment options.&lt;ref name="middlebury.edu"/&gt;

==Connection to Alzheimer's disease==

Studies have shown that PCA may be a variant of [[Alzheimer's disease]] (AD), with an emphasis on visual deficits.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Goenthals 2001 115–119"/&gt;  Although in primarily different, but sometimes overlapping, brain regions, both involve progressive neural degeneration, as shown by the loss of neurons and synapses, and the presence of [[neurofibrillary tangle]]s and [[senile plaques]] in affected brain regions; this eventually leads to [[dementia]] in both diseases.&lt;ref name="Kennedy 2011 248–257"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hof 1997 3609–3625"/&gt;  PCA patients have more cortical damage and [[Grey matter|gray matter]] (cell body) loss in posterior regions, especially in the occipital, parietal, and temporal lobes, whereas Alzheimer’s patients typically experience more damage in the [[prefrontal cortex]] and [[hippocampus]].&lt;ref name="Crutch 2013 463–465"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kennedy 2011 248–257"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tsunoda|first=Ayami|author2=Shuji Iritani |author3=Norio Ozaki |title=Presenile dementia diagnosed as posterior cortical atrophy|journal=Psychogeriatrics|date=17 March 2011|volume=11|issue=171-176|doi=10.1111/j.1479-8301.2011.00366.x|pages=171–176}}&lt;/ref&gt;  PCA tends to impair [[working memory]] and [[Anterograde amnesia|anterograde memory]], while leaving [[episodic memory]] intact, whereas AD patients typically have damaged episodic memory, suggesting some differences still lie in the primary areas of cortical damage.&lt;ref name="Crutch 2012 170–178"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kennedy 2011 248–257"/&gt;

Over time, however, atrophy in PCA patients may spread to regions commonly damaged in AD patients, leading to common AD symptoms such as deficits in memory, language, learning, and cognition.&lt;ref name="Goenthals 2001 115–119"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Goenthals|first=Maartin|author2=Patrick Santens|title=Posterior cortical atrophy.

There is no standard definition of PCA and no established diagnostic criteria, so it is not possible to know how many people have the condition. Some studies have found that about 5 percent of people diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease have PCA. However, because PCA often goes unrecognized, the true percentage may be as high as 15 percent. Researchers and physicians are working to establish a standard definition and diagnostic criteria for PCA.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.alz.org/dementia/posterior-cortical-atrophy.asp|title=Posterior Cortical Atrophy {{!}} Signs, Symptoms, &amp; Diagnosis|website=Dementia|access-date=2016-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Predictify'''.com was a [[Web 2.0]] company based in [[Redwood City, California]]. It was founded by [[Stanford University]] graduates Parker Barrile and Michael Agnich.  It went out of business in 2009, [https://techcrunch.com/2009/08/07/outlook-not-so-good-predictify-heads-to-the-deadpool/ according to this article.].

Users of the site users submitted deterministic, verifiable questions concerning future events.  Other users then gave answers and [[predict]]ed the outcome.

Users who answered questions were rewarded in two ways. First, the accuracy of user responses was tracked and reevaluated each time a question that the user answered closed.  Predictify assigned users to one of five "levels" depending on the user's accuracy [[percentile]].&lt;ref name=predictify_faq&gt;{{cite web |title=FAQs - Predicitfy |url=http://www.predictify.com/help.aspx | publisher=Predicitfy.com INC | accessdate=2008-08-15 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080805052654/http://www.predictify.com/help.aspx &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2008-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Users could also earn money for correctly answering "Premium Questions".  Premium questions were generally submitted by [[companies]].  The submitter of a premium question received detailed [[demographic]] information and analysis on each answer given.&lt;ref name=predictify_faq /&gt; Part of the fee paid by premium question submitters constituted the "pot" from which correct answers were paid.

The site allowed [[marketing]] and [[market research]] in a manner far less obvious than most traditional advertising and survey methods.  Users didn't realize that their predictions may have strongly affected the outcome of the question.  For example, if a company was considering increasing the cost of a product, they could [[Statistical survey|survey]] consumers to determine how much more they were willing to pay.  The outcome of the survey would then set the new price of the product.  The company could further sort the data based on the demographic information collected on respondents, to ensure that they priced the product correctly for their [[target market]]. The demographic analysis of respondents was very valuable to companies and was the true product Predictify sells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Companies could also use questions on Predictify to conduct [[guerilla advertising]] campaigns.  Users would try to answer premium questions correctly, in order to win the cash prize associated with the question.  In the course of formulating their prediction they may have researched the subject of the question.  Companies could create interest in their products by asking questions about them; individuals answering the question may have visited the company's website to learn more about the product.  Dilbert creator, Scott Adams, posted a question seeking sales volume projections of a book he authored. Early customers and partnerships were established by the company's first full-time employee, Ed Heacox.

The [[Washington Post]], [[New York Times]], and [[San Francisco Chronicle]] all have used Predictify to judge reader interest in stories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

According to an announcement made in Predictify's official page, the company ceased operations and shut down the entire Predictify service on September 1, 2009.

'''Charlotte Wilhelmine Christiane Marie of Hesse-Darmstadt''' (5 November 1755, [[Darmstadt]] &amp;ndash; 12 December 1785, [[Hanover]]), was by marriage Duchess of [[Duchy of Mecklenburg-Strelitz|Mecklenburg-Strelitz]].

== Life ==
Charlotte was a daughter of [[Prince George William of Hesse-Darmstadt]] (1722-1782) from his marriage to [[Countess Maria Louise Albertine of Leiningen-Falkenburg-Dagsburg]] (1729-1818), daughter of Count [[Christian Karl Reinhard of Leiningen-Dachsburg-Falkenburg-Heidesheim]].

The princess was first engaged with the hereditary prince [[Peter Friedrich Wilhelm, Duke of Oldenburg|Peter Frederick William of Oldenburg]], but the engagement was dissolved again as a result of the onset of Peter's mental illness.

Charlotte married [[Charles II, Grand Duke of Mecklenburg|Charles of Mecklenburg-Strelitz]] (who later became the Duke of Mecklenburg-Strelitz), on 28 September 1784 in Darmstadt.  He was previously married to Charlotte's older sister [[Princess Friederike of Hesse-Darmstadt|Friederike]], who had died in childbirth.  She thus became stepmother for her sister's five surviving children - her nieces and nephews.

The couple lived in [[Hanover]], where Charles served as [[Governor-General]] for his brother-in-law, King [[George III of the United Kingdom|George]].  Charlotte died after the birth of her only child, a year after their marriage. Charles resigned from his post in Hanover and moved to Charlotte's mother in Darmstadt, who then took care of his children (both Frederike's and Charlotte's).

== Offspring ==
Her only child from her marriage to Charles was:
* [[Duke Charles of Mecklenburg|Charles]] (1785-1837), General and President of the Prussian State Council

'''Rana Bokhari''' (born October 23, 1977) was the leader of the [[Manitoba Liberal Party]] from 2013 until 2016 in [[Manitoba]], Canada.

==Background==
Bokhari was born on a farm near Anola, Manitoba.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ibtimes.com/rana-bokhari-first-south-asian-party-chief-manitoba-canada-premiership-long-shot-1443888 |title=New Manitoba Liberal leader Bokhari looks to get party in 'fighting form' |first=Larry |last=Kusch |date=October 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a student she attended the [[University of Manitoba]] where she obtained degrees in criminology and psychology. She then went on to complete a degree in law at [[Robson Hall (Faculty of Law – University of Manitoba)|Robson Hall]], focusing on corporate commercial law. Bokhari was active in the Manitoba Law Students Association, serving as President in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Robson Hall Overview 2012|url=http://law.robsonhall.ca/images/stories/RobsonHall_Overview_2012.pdf|accessdate=15 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bokhari moved to Pakistan in 2002, living there with her family until she returned to Winnipeg in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;Robson Hall Student Profiles {{cite web |url=http://law.robsonhall.ca/flipbook/flip_book_files/CUserschlopeckDesktopRobson_Hall_Alumni_Report_2012-6/pages/file59.swf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-11-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129021118/http://law.robsonhall.ca/flipbook/flip_book_files/CUserschlopeckDesktopRobson_Hall_Alumni_Report_2012-6/pages/file59.swf |archivedate=2014-11-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Her childhood home and family chicken farm were lost to a fire in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;Family loses barns, home to fire. http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/family-loses-barns-home-to-fire-1.1205984&lt;/ref&gt;

==Liberal leadership==
After long-standing Manitoba Liberal Party leader [[Jon Gerrard]] resigned his position, Bokhari was the first person formally to declare her candidacy. She faced two opponents, Bob Axworthy and [[Dougald Lamont]]. During the party leadership contest, Bokhari was seen as an outsider. Although two of her relatives had stood as Liberal candidates at the previous provincial election, she had not previously had a profile in the provincial party. Despite this, she was endorsed by the Manitoba Senator [[Maria Chaput]], the leading Liberal candidate from the 2011 elections, Paul Hesse and party Vice-President Robert Young. She won a first ballot victory by one vote, with 431 votes.

The victory made Rana Bokhari the youngest person ever to lead the Manitoba Liberals and the first Manitoban of [[List of Asian-Canadian First Ministers|South Asian]] descent to lead a political party in the province.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=An 'emotional roller-coaster' for new Liberal leader |author= Larry Kusch |url=http://www.winnipegfreepress.com/local/liberals-have-a-new-leader-229427251.html |publisher=''Winnipeg Free Press |date=October 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She faced internal criticism from party members and former leadership challenger Bob Axworthy, who accused Bokhari of "purging" longtime Manitoba Liberal members as she solidified control of the party.&lt;ref&gt;Liberal Leader Faces More Internal Turmoil http://winnipeg.ctvnews.ca/manitoba-liberal-leader-rana-bokhari-faces-more-internal-turmoil-1.1785566&lt;/ref&gt; Party membership and fundraising struggled under Bokhari,&lt;ref&gt;Rana Bokhari won Manitoba Liberal leadership with least donors http://globalnews.ca/news/1330133/rana-bokhari-won-manitoba-liberal-leadership-with-least-donors/&lt;/ref&gt;.

Bokhari committed to making Manitoba the "hub of something" in her year end interview with the Winnipeg Free Press. She explained "I want Manitoba to be the IT capital of this country or the innovation capital of this country."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.winnipegfreepress.com/local/in-conversation-with-rana-bokhari-up-close-287401381.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014 Bokhari endorsed Winnipeg mayoral candidate [[Brian Bowman (politician)|Brian Bowman]] in the [[Manitoba municipal elections, 2014#Winnipeg|2014 Winnipeg Municipal election]].&lt;ref&gt;Bowman has momentum in new poll numbers http://winnipeg.ctvnews.ca/bowman-sees-momentum-in-new-poll-numbers-1.2040346&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Manitoba general election, 2016]] Bokhari finished third in [[Fort Rouge (electoral district)|Fort Rouge]], behind future [[Manitoba NDP]] leader Wab Kinew. On May 7, 2016, Bokhari announced that she would not lead the party into the next election but would remain on as leader until her successor was chosen.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/rana-bokhari-steps-down-liberal-party-leader-manitoba-1.3572299&lt;/ref&gt; She ultimately resigned as leader, effective September 24, 2016, and opened a law practice, Bokhari, Smith and Walker, the same month.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.winnipegfreepress.com/local/former-liberal-leader-bokhari-moving-on-to-new-law-firm-394678411.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In the field of [[developmental biology]], '''regional differentiation''' is the process by which different areas are identified in the development of the early [[embryo]].&lt;ref&gt;Slack, J.M.W. (2013) Essential Developmental Biology. Wiley-Blackwell, Oxford.
&lt;/ref&gt; The process by which the [[Cell (biology)|cells]] become specified differs between [[organism]]s.

==Cell fate determination==
{{main|Cell fate determination}}
In terms of developmental commitment, a cell can either be specified or it can be determined. Specification is the first stage in differentiation.&lt;ref name="Gilbert"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gilbert|first1=Scott|title=Developmental biology|date=2006|publisher=Sinauer Associates, Inc. Publishers|location=Sunderland, Mass.|isbn=978-0-87893-250-4|pages=53–55|edition=8th}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A cell that is specified can have its commitment reversed while the determined state is irreversible.&lt;ref&gt;Slack, J.M.W. (1991) From egg to embryo. Regional specification in early development. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge&lt;/ref&gt; There are two main types of specification: autonomous and conditional. A cell specified autonomously will develop into a specific fate based upon cytoplasmic determinants with no regard to the environment the cell is in. A cell specified conditionally will develop into a specific fate based upon other surrounding cells or [[morphogen]] gradients. Another type of specification is [[syncytium|syncytial]] specification, characteristic of most [[insect]] classes.&lt;ref name="Gilbert"/&gt;

Specification in [[sea urchins]] uses both autonomous and conditional mechanisms to determine the anterior/posterior axis. The anterior/posterior axis lies along the animal/vegetal axis set up during [[cleavage (embryo)|cleavage]]. The micromeres induce the nearby tissue to become [[endoderm]] while the animal cells are specified to become [[ectoderm]]. The animal cells are not determined because the micromeres can induce the animal cells to also take on [[mesodermal]] and endodermal fates. It was observed that [[beta-catenin|β-catenin]] was present in the [[Cell nucleus|nuclei]] at the vegetal pole of the [[blastula]]. Through a series of experiments, one study confirmed the role of β-catenin in the cell-autonomous specification of vegetal cell fates and the micromeres inducing ability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=McClay D, Peterson R, Range R, Winter-Vann A, Ferkowicz M | title = A micromere induction signal is activated by beta-catenin and acts through notch to initiate specification of secondary mesenchyme cells in the sea urchin embryo. | journal = Development | volume = 127 | issue = 23 | pages = 5113–22 | year = 2000 | pmid = 11060237}}&lt;/ref&gt; Treatments of LiCl sufficient to vegetalize the embryo resulted in increases in nuclearly localized b-catenin. Reduction of expression of β-catenin in the nucleus correlated with loss of vegetal cell fates. Transplants of micromeres lacking nuclear accumulation of β-catenin were unable to induce a second axis.

For the molecular mechanism of β-catenin and the micromeres, it was observed that [[Notch signaling|Notch]] was present uniformly on the apical surface of the early blastula but was lost in the secondary [[mesenchyme]] cells (SMCs) during late blastula and enriched in the presumptive endodermal cells in late blastula. Notch is both necessary and sufficient for determination of the SMCs. The micromeres express the ligand for Notch, Delta, on their surface to induce the formation of SMCs.

The high nuclear levels of b-catenin results from the high accumulation of the disheveled protein at the vegetal pole of the egg. disheveled inactivates GSK-3 and prevents the [[phosphorylation]] of β-catenin. This allows β-catenin to escape degradation and enter the nucleus. The only important role of β-catenin is to activate the [[transcription (genetics)|transcription]] of the gene Pmar1. This gene represses a repressor to allow micromere genes to be expressed.

The [[Anatomic terms of location#Radially symmetrical organisms|aboral/oral axis]] (analogous to the dorsal/ventral axes in other animals) is specified by a [[NODAL|nodal]] homolog. This nodal was localized on the future oral side of the embryo. Experiments confirmed that nodal is both necessary and sufficient to promote development of the oral fate. Nodal also has a role in left/right axis formation.

==Tunicates==
[[Tunicates]] have been a popular choice for the study of regional specification because tunicates were the first organism in which autonomous specification was discovered and tunicates are evolutionary related to vertebrates.

Early observations in tunicates led to the identification of the yellow crescent (also called the myoplasm). This cytoplasm was segregated to future muscle cells and if transplanted could induce the formation of muscle cells. The cytoplasmic determinant macho-1 was isolated as the necessary and sufficient factor for muscle cell formation. Similar to Sea urchins, the accumulation of b-catenin in the nuclei was identified as both necessary and sufficient to induce endoderm.

Two more cell fates are determined by conditional specification. The endoderm sends a fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signal to specify the notocord and the mesenchyme fates. Anterior cells respond to FGF to become notocord while posterior cells (identified by the presence of macho-1) respond to FGF to become mesenchyme.

The cytoplasm of the egg not only determines cell fate, but also determines the dorsal/ventral axis. The cytoplasm in the vegetal pole specifies this axis and removing this cytoplasm leads to a loss of axis information. The yellow cytoplasm specifies the anterior/posterior axis. When the yellow cytoplasm moves to the posterior of the egg to become posterior vegetal cytoplasm (PVC), the anterior/posterior axis is specified. Removal of the PVC leads to a loss of the axis while transplantation to the anterior reverses the axis.

==''C. elegans''==
In the two cell stage, the embryo of the nematode ''[[Caenorhabditis elegans|C. elegans]]'' exhibits [[mosaic behavior]]. There are two cells, the P1 cell and the AB cell. The P1 cell was able make all of its fated cells while the AB cell could only make a portion of the cells it was fated to produce. Thus, The first division gives the autonomous specification of the two cells, but the AB cells require a conditional mechanism to produce all of its fated cells.

The AB lineage gives rise to neurons, skin, and pharynx. The P1 cell divides into EMS and P2. The EMS cell divides into MS and E. The MS lineage gives rise to pharynx, muscle, and neurons. The E lineage gives rise to intestines. The P2 cell divides into P3 and C founder cells. The C founder cells give rise to muscle, skin, and neurons. The P3 cell divides into P4 and D founder cells. The D founder cells give rise to muscle while the P4 lineage gives rise to the germ line.

*Axis specification
:The anterior/posterior axis is specified by the sperm at the posterior side. At the two cell stage, the anterior cell is the AB cell while the posterior cell is the P1 cell. The dorsal/ventral axis of the animal is set by a random position of cells during the four cell stage of the embryo. The dorsal cell is the ABp cell while the ventral cell is the EMS cell.

*Localization of cytoplasmic determinants
:The autonomous specification of C. elegans arises from different cytoplasmic determinants. PAR proteins are responsible for partitioning these determinants in the early embryo. These proteins are located at the periphery of the zygote and play a role in intracellular signaling. The current model for the function of these proteins is that they cause local changes in the cytoplasm that lead to different protein accumulation in the posterior vs. the anterior. Mex-5 accumulates in the anterior while PIE-1 and P granules (see below) accumulate in the posterior.

*Specification of germ line
:P granules were identified as the cytoplasmic determinants. While uniformly present at fertilization, these granules become localized in the posterior P1 cell prior to the first division. These granules are further localized between each division into P cells (ex. P2, P3) until after the fourth division when they are put into the P4 cells which become the germ line.

*Specification of EMS and P1 cells
:Other proteins that are likely to function as localized cytoplasmic determinants in the P1 lineage include SKN-1, PIE-1 and PAL-1.

:SKN-1 is a cytoplasmic determinant that is localized in the P1 cell lineage and determines EMS cell fate. PIE-1 is localized in the P2 cell lineage and is a general repressor of transcription. SKN-1 is repressed in P2 cells and is unable to specify a EMS fate in these cells. The repressive activity of PIE-1 is required to keep the germ line lineage from differentiating.

*Specification of C and D founder cells
:PAL-1 is required to specify the fates of the C and D founder cells (derived from the P2 lineage). PAL-1, however, is present in both EMS and P2. Normally, PAL-1 activity is repressed in EMS by SKN-1 but not repressed in P2. Both C and D founder cells depend on PAL-1 but there is another factor that is required to distinguish C from D.

*Specification of E lineage
:The specification of the E lineage depends on signals from P2 to the EMS cell. Components of [[Wnt signaling pathway|Wnt signaling]] were involved and were named ''mom'' genes. ''mom-2'' is a member of the Wnt family of proteins (i.e. the signal) and ''mom-5'' is a member of the frizzled family of proteins (i.e. the receptor).

*Specification of ABa and ABp
:The specification of ABa and ABp depend on another cell-cell signaling event. A difference between these two cell types is that ABa gives rise to anterior pharynx while ABp does not contribute to pharynx. A signal from MS at the 12-cell stage induces pharynx in ABa progeny cells but not in ABp progeny. Signals from the P2 cells prevent the ABp from forming pharynx. This signal from the P2 was discovered to be APX-1 within the Delta family of proteins. These proteins are known to be ligands for the [[Notch signaling|Notch]] protein. GLP-1, a Notch protein, is also required for specification of the fate of ABp.

==''Drosophila''==
{{see also|Drosophila embryogenesis|Maternal effect}}

===Anterior/posterior axis===
The anterior/posterior patterning of ''[[Drosophila]]'' come from three maternal groups of genes. The anterior group patterns the head and thoracic segments. The posterior group patterns the abdominal segments and the terminal group patterns the anterior and posterior terminal regions called the terminalia (the acron in the anterior and the telson in the posterior).

The anterior group genes include bicoid. Bicoid functions as a graded morphogen transcription factor that localizes to the nucleus. The head of the embryo forms at the point of highest concentration of bicoid and the anterior pattern depends upon the concentration of bicoid. Bicoid works as a transcriptional activator of the gap genes hunchback (hb), buttonhead (btd), empty spiracles (ems), and orthodentical (otd) while also acting to repress translation of caudal. A different affinity for bicoid in the promoters of the genes it activates allows for the concentration dependent activation. Otd has a low affinity for bicoid, hb has a higher affinity and so will be activated at a lower bicoid concentration. Two other anterior group genes, swallow and exuperantia play a role in localizing bicoid to the anterior. Bicoid is directed to the anterior by its 3' untranslated region (3'UTR). The microtubule cytoskeleton also plays a role in localizing bicoid.

The posterior group genes include nanos. Similar to bicoid, nanos is localized to the posterior pole as a graded morphogen. The only role of nanos is to repress the maternally transcribed hunchback mRNA in the posterior. Another protein, pumilio, is required for nanos to repress hunchback. Other posterior proteins, oskar (which tethers nanos mRNA), Tudor, [[Vasa gene|vasa]], and Valois, localize the germ line determinants and nanos to the posterior.

In contrast to the anterior and the posterior, the positional information for the terminalia come from the follicle cells of the ovary. The terminalia are specified through the action of the Torso receptor tyrosine kinase. The follicle cells secrete Torso-like into the perivitelline space only at the poles. Torso-like cleaves the pro-peptide Trunk which appears to be the Torso ligand. Trunk activates Torso and causes a signal transduction cascade which represses the transcriptional repressor Groucho which in turn causes the activation of the terminal gap genes tailless and huckebein.

===Segmentation and homeotic genes===
The patterning from the maternal genes work to influence the expression of the [[segmentation gene]]s. The segmentation genes are embryonically expressed genes that specify the numbers, size and polarity of the segments. The [[gap gene]]s are directly influenced by the maternal genes and are expressed in local and overlapping regions along the anterior/posterior axis. These genes are influenced by not only the maternal genes, but also by epistatic interactions between the other gap genes.

The gap genes work to activate the [[pair-rule gene]]s. Each pair-rule gene is expressed in seven stripes as a result of the combined effect of the gap genes and interactions between the other pair-rule genes. The pair-rule genes can be divided into two classes: the primary pair-rule genes and the secondary pair-rule genes. The primary pair-rules genes are able to influence the secondary pair-rule genes but not vice versa. The molecular mechanism between the regulation of the primary pair-rule genes was understood through a complex analysis of the regulation of even-skipped. Both positive and negative regulatory interactions by both maternal and gap genes and a unique combination of transcription factors work to express even-skipped in different parts of the embryo. The same gap gene can act positively in one stripe but negatively in another.

The expression of the pair-rule genes translate into the expression of the [[segment polarity gene]]s in 14 stripes. The role of the segment polarity genes is to define to boundaries and the polarity of the segments. The means to which the genes accomplish this is believed to involve a wingless and hedgehog graded distribution or cascade of signals initiated by these proteins. Unlike the gap and the pair-rule genes, the segment polarity genes function within cells rather than within the syncytium. Thus, segment polarity genes influence patterning though signaling rather than autonomously. Also, the gap and pair-rule genes are expressed transiently while segment polarity gene expression is maintained throughout development. The continued expression of the segment polarity genes is maintained by a feedback loop involving hedgehog and wingless.

While the segmentation genes can specify the number, size, and polarity of segments, [[homeotic gene]]s can specify the identity of the segment. The homeotic genes are activated by gap genes and pair-rule genes. The [[Antennapedia]] complex and the [[Bithorax complex|bithorax]] complex on the third chromosome contain the major homeotic genes required for specifying segmental identity (actually parasegmental identity). These genes are transcription factors and are expressed in overlapping regions that correlate with their position along the chromosome. These transcription factors regulate other transcription factors, cell surface molecules with roles in cell adhesion, and other cell signals. Later during development, homeotic genes are expressed in the nervous system in a similar anterior/posterior pattern. Homeotic genes are maintained throughout development through the modification of the condensation state of their chromatin. Polycomb genes maintain the chromatin in an inactive conformation while trithorax genes maintain chromatin in an active conformation.

All homeotic genes share a segment of protein with a similar sequence and structure called the [[Homeobox|homeodomain]] (the DNA sequence is called the homeobox). This region of the homeotic proteins binds DNA. This domain was found in other developmental regulatory proteins, such as bicoid, as well in other animals including humans. Molecular mapping revealed that the HOX gene cluster has been inherited intact from a common ancestor of flies and mammals which indicates that it is a fundamental developmental regulatory system.

===Dorsal/ventral axis===

The maternal protein, Dorsal, functions like a graded morphogen to set the ventral side of the embryo (the name comes from mutations which led to a [[dorsalized]] phenotype). ''Dorsal'' is like ''bicoid'' in that it is a nuclear protein; however, unlike ''bicoid,'' ''dorsal'' is uniformly distributed throughout the embryo. The concentration difference arises from differential nuclear transport. The mechanism by which ''dorsa''l becomes differentially located into the nuclei occurs in three steps.

The first step happens in the dorsal side of the embryo. The nucleus in the oocyte moves along a microtubule track to one side of the oocyte. This side sends a signal, ''[[Gurken localisation signal|gurken]]'', to the ''torpedo'' receptors on the follicle cells. The ''torpedo'' receptor is found in all follicle cells; however, the ''gurken'' signal is only found on the anterior dorsal side of the oocyte. The follicle cells change shape and synthetic properties to distinguish the dorsal side from the ventral side. These dorsal follicle cells are unable to produce the pipe protein required for step two.

The second step is a signal from the ventral follicle cells back to the oocyte. This signal acts after the egg has left the follicle cells so this signal is stored in the perivitelline space. The follicle cells secrete ''windbeutel,'' ''nudel,'' and ''pipe,'' which create a protease-activating complex. Because the dorsal follicle cells do not express ''pipe,'' they are not able to create this complex. Later, the embryo secretes three inactive proteases (''gastrulation defective,'' ''snake,'' and ''Easter'') and an inactive ligand (''spätzle'') into the perivitelline space. These proteases are activated by the complex and cleave ''spätzle'' into an active form. This active protein is distributed in a ventral to dorsal gradient. ''Toll'' is a receptor tyrosine kinase for ''spätzle'' and transduces the graded ''spätzle'' signal through the cytoplasm to phosphorylate ''cactus''. Once phosphorylated, ''cactus'' no longer binds to ''dorsal,'' leaving it free to enter the nucleus. The amount of released ''dorsal'' depends on the amount of ''spätzle'' protein present.

The third step is the regional expression of zygotic genes ''[[decapentaplegic]]'' (''dpp''), ''[[zerknüllt]]'', ''tolloid'', ''twist'', ''snail'', and ''rhomboid'' due to the expression of ''dorsal'' in the nucleus. High levels of ''dorsal'' are required to turn on transcription of ''twist'' and ''snail.'' Low levels of ''dorsal'' can activate the transcription of ''rhomboid.'' ''Dorsal'' represses the transcription of ''zerknüllt,'' ''tolloid,'' and ''dpp.'' The zygotic genes also interact with each other to restrict their domains of expression.

==Amphibians==

===Dorsal/ventral axis and organizer===
Between [[fertilization]] and the first cleavage in ''[[Xenopus]]'' embryos, the cortical cytoplasm of the zygote rotates relative to the central cytoplasm by about 30 degrees to uncover (in some species) a gray crescent in the marginal or middle region of the embryo. The cortical rotation is powered by microtubules motors moving along parallel arrays of cortical microtubules. This gray crescent marks the future dorsal side of the embryo. Blocking this rotation prevents formation of the dorsal/ventral axis. By the late blastula stage, the ''Xenopus'' embryos have a clear dorsal/ventral axis.

In the early gastrula, most of the tissue in the embryo is not determined. The one exception is the anterior portion of the dorsal blastopore lip. When this tissue was transplanted to another part of the embryo, it developed as it normally would. In addition, this tissue was able to induce the formation of another dorsal/ventral axis. [[Hans Spemann]] named this region the organizer and the induction of the dorsal axis the primary induction.

The organizer is induced from a dorsal vegetal region called the [[Nieuwkoop center]]. There are many different developmental potentials throughout the blastula stage embryos. The vegetal cap can give rise to only endodermal cell types while the animal cap can give rise to only ectodermal cell types. The marginal zone, however, can give rise to most structures in the embryo including [[mesoderm]]. A series of experiments by [[Pieter Nieuwkoop]] showed that if the marginal zone is removed and the animal and vegetal caps placed next to each other, the mesoderm comes from the animal cap and the dorsal tissues are always adjacent to the dorsal vegetal cells. Thus, this dorsal vegetal region, named the Nieuwkoop center, was able to induce the formation of the organizer.

Twinning assays identified [[Wnt signaling pathway|Wnt proteins]] as molecules from the Nieuwkoop center that could specify the dorsal/ventral axis. In twinning assays, molecules are injected into the ventral blastomere of a four-cell stage embryo. If the molecules specifies the dorsal axis, dorsal structures will be formed on the ventral side. Wnt proteins were not necessary to specify the axis, but examination of other proteins in the Wnt pathway led to the discovery that β-catenin was. β-catenin is present in the nuclei on the dorsal side but not on the ventral side. β-catenin levels are regulated by GSK-3. When active, GSK-3 phosphorylates free β-catenin, which is then targeted for degradation. There are two possible molecules that might regulate GSK-3: GBP (GSK-3 Binding Protein) and Dishevelled. The current model is that these act together to inhibit GSK-3 activity. Dishevelled is able to induce a secondary axis when overexpressed and is present at higher levels on the dorsal side after cortical rotation ([[Symmetry Breaking and Cortical Rotation]]). Depletion of Dishevelled, however, has no effect. GBP has an effect both when depleted and overexpressed. Recent evidence, however, showed that Xwnt11, a Wnt molecule expressed in ''Xenopus'', was both sufficient and necessary for dorsal axis formation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Tao Q, Yokota C, Puck H, Kofron M, Birsoy B, Yan D, Asashima M, Wylie C, Lin X, Heasman J | title = Maternal wnt11 activates the canonical wnt signaling pathway required for axis formation in ''Xenopus'' embryos. | journal = Cell | volume = 120 | issue = 6 | pages = 857–71 | year = 2005 | pmid = 15797385 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2005.01.013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mesoderm formation comes from two signals: one for the ventral portion and one for the dorsal portion. Animal cap assays were used to determine the molecular signals from the vegetal cap that are able to induce the animal cap to form mesoderm. In an animal cap assay, molecules of interest are either applied in medium that the cap is grown in or injected as mRNA in an early embryo. These experiments identified a group of molecules, the [[transforming growth factor-β]] (TGF-β) family. With dominant negative forms of TGF-β, early experiments were only able to identify the family of molecules involved not the specific member. Recent experiments have identified the ''Xenopus'' nodal-related proteins (Xnr-1, Xnr-2, and Xnr-4) as the mesoderm-inducing signals. Inhibitors of these ligands prevents mesoderm formation and these proteins show a graded distribution along the dorsal/ventral axis.

Vegetally localized mRNA, VegT and possibly Vg1, are involved in inducing the endoderm. It is hypothesized that VegT also activates the Xnr-1,2,4 proteins. VegT acts as a transcription factor to activate genes specifying endodermal fate while Vg1 acts as a paracrine factor.

β-catenin in the nucleus activates two transcription factors: siamois and twin. β-catenin also acts synergistically with VegT to produce high levels of Xnr-1,2,4. Siamois will act synergistically with Xnr-1,2,4 to activate a high level of the transcription factors such as goosecoid in the organizer. Areas in the embryo with lower levels of Xnr-1,2,4 will express ventral or lateral mesoderm. Nuclear β-catenin works synergistically with the mesodermal cell fate signal to create the signaling activity of the Nieuwkoop center to induce the formation of the organizer in the dorsal mesoderm.

===Organizer function===
There are two classes of genes that are responsible for the organizer's activity: transcription factors and secreted proteins. [[Goosecoid]] (which has a homology between bicoid and gooseberry) is the first known gene to be expressed in the organizer and is both sufficient and necessary to specify a secondary axis.

The organizer induces ventral mesoderm to become lateral mesoderm, induces the ectoderm to form neural tissue and induces dorsal structures in the endoderm. The mechanism behind these inductions is an inhibition of the [[bone morphogenetic protein|bone morphogenetic protein 4]] signaling pathway that ventralizes the embryo. In the absence of these signals, ectoderm reverts to its default state of neural tissue. Four of the secreted molecules from the organizer, chordin, noggin, follistatin and Xenopus nodal-related-3 (Xnr-3), directly interact with BMP-4 and block its ability to bind to its receptor. Thus, these molecules create a gradient of BMP-4 along the dorsal/ventral axis of the mesoderm.

BMP-4 mainly acts in trunk and tail region of the embryo while a different set of signals work in the head region. Xwnt-8 is expressed throughout the ventral and lateral mesoderm. The endomesoderm (can give rise to either endoderm or mesoderm) at the leading edge of the archenteron (future anterior) secrete three factors [[Cerberus (protein)|Cerberus]], Dickkopf, and [[Frzb]]. While Cerberus and Frzb bind directly to Xwnt-8 to prevent it from binding to its receptor, Cerberus is also capable of binding to BMP-4 and Xnr1.&lt;ref name=pmid12952900&gt;{{cite journal |last=Silva |first=A C |authorlink= |author2=Filipe M |author3=Kuerner K M K |author4=Steinbeisser H |author5=BelocJ A  |date=Oct 2003 |title=Endogenous Cerberus activity is required for anterior head specification in Xenopus. |journal=Development |volume=130 |issue=20 |pages=4943–53 |publisher= |location = England | issn = 0950-1991| pmid =  12952900|doi=10.1242/dev.00705  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Dickkopf binds to LRP-5, a transmembrane protein important for the signalling pathway of Xwnt-8, leading to endocytosis of LRP-5 and eventually to an inhibition of the Xwnt-8 pathway.

===Anterior/posterior axis===
The anterior/posterior patterning of the embryo occurs sometime before or during [[gastrulation]]. The first cells to involute have anterior inducing activity while the last cells have posterior inducing activity. The anterior inducing ability comes from the Xwnt-8 antagonizing signals Cereberus, Dickkopf and Frzb discussed above. Anterior head development also requires the function of IGFs (insulin-like growth factors) expressed in the dorsal midline and the anterior neural tube. It is believed that IGFs function by activating a signal transduction cascade that interferes and inhibits both Wnt signaling and BMP signaling. In the posterior, two candidates for posteriorizing signals include eFGF, a fibroblast growth factor homologue, and [[retinoic acid]].

==Fish==
The basis for axis formation in [[Danio rerio|zebrafish]] parallels what is known in amphibians. The embryonic shield has the same function as the dorsal lip of the blastopore and acts as the organizer. When transplanted, it is able to organize a secondary axis and removing it prevents the formation of dorsal structures. β-catenin also has a role similar to its role in amphibians. It accumulates in the nucleus only on the dorsal side; ventral β-catenin induces a secondary axis. It activates the expression of Squint (a Nodal related signaling protein aka ndr1) and Bozozok (a homeodomain transcription factor similar to Siamois) which act together to activate goosecoid in the embryonic shield.

As in Xenopus, mesoderm induction involves two signals: one from the vegetal pole to induce ventral mesoderm and one from the Nieuwkoop center equivalent dorsal vegetal cells to induce dorsal mesoderm.

The signals from the organizer also parallel to those from amphibians. Noggin and chordin homologue Chordino, binds to a BMP family  member, BMP2B, to block it from ventralizing the embryo. Dickkopf binds to a Wnt homolog Wnt8 to block it from ventralizing and posteriorizing the embryo.

There is a third pathway regulated by β-catenin in fish. β-catenin activates the transcription factor stat3. Stat3 coordinates cell movements during gastrulation and contributes to establishing planar polarity.

==Birds==
The dorsal/ventral axis is defined in [[Chicken|chick]] embryos by the orientation of the cells with respect to the yolk. Ventral is down with respect to the yolk while animal is up. This axis is defined by the creation of a pH difference "inside" and "outside" of the blastoderm between the subgerminal space and the albumin on the outside. The subgerminal space has a pH of 6.5 while the albumin on the outside has a pH of 9.5.

The anterior/posterior axis is defined during the initial tilting of the embryo when the eggshell is being desposited. The egg is constantly being rotated in a consistent direction and there is a partial stratification of the yolk; the lighter yolk components will be near one end of the blastoderm and will become the future posterior. The molecular basis of the posterior is not known, however, the accumulation of cells eventually results in the posterior marginal zone (PMZ).

The PMZ is the equivalent of the Nieuwkoop center is that its role is to induce Hensen's node. Transplantation of the PMZ results in induction of a primitive streak, however, PMZ does not contribute to the streak itself. Similar to the Nieuwkoop center, the PMZ expresses both Vg1 and nuclear localized β-catenin.

The Hensen's node is equivalent to the organizer. Transplantation of Hensen's node results in the formation of a secondary axis. Hensen's node is the site where gastrulation begins and it becomes the dorsal mesoderm. Hensen's node is formed from the induction of PMZ on the anterior part of the PMZ called [[Koller's sickle]]. When the primitive streak forms, these cells expand out to become Hensen's node. These cells express goosecoid consistent with their role as the organizer.

The function of the organizer in chick embryos is similar to that of amphibians and fish, however, there are some differences. Similar to the amphibians and fish, the organizer does secrete Chordin, Noggin and Nodal proteins that antagonize BMP signaling and dorsalize the embryo. Neural induction, however, does not rely entirely on inhibiting the BMP signaling. Overexpression of BMP antagonists is not enough induce formation of neurons nor overexpressing BMP block formation of neurons. While the whole story is unknown for neural induction, FGFs seem to play a role in mesoderm and neural induction. The anterior/posterior patterning of the embryo requires signals like cereberus from the hyboplast and the spatial regulation of [[retinoic acid]] accumulation to activate the 3' Hox genes in the posterior neuroectoderm (hindbrain and spinal cord).

==Mammals==
The earliest specification in [[mouse]] embryos occurs between [[trophoblast]] and inner cell mass cells in the outer polar cells and the inner apolar cells respectively. These two groups become specified at the eight-cell stage during compaction, but do not become determined until they reach the 64-cell stage. If an apolar cell is transplanted to the outside during the 8-32 cell stage, that cell will develop as a trophoblast cell.

The anterior/posterior axis in the mouse embryo is specified by two signaling centers. In the mouse embryo, the egg forms a cylinder with the epiblast forming a cup at the distal end of that cylinder. The epiblast is surrounded by the visceral endoderm, the equivalent of the hypoblast of humans and chicks. Signals for the anterior/posterior axis come from [[Hensen's node|primitive knot]]. The other important site is the [[anterior visceral endoderm]] (AVE). The AVE lies anterior to the node's most anterior position and lies just under the epiblast in the region that will become occupied by migrating endomesoderm to form head mesoderm and foregut endoderm. The AVE interacts with the node to specify the most anterior structures. Thus, the node is able to form a normal trunk, but requires signals from the AVE to form a head.

The discovery of the homeobox in ''Drosophila'' flies and its conservation in other animals has led to advancements in understanding the anterior/posterior patterning. Most of the Hox genes in mammals show an expression pattern that parallels the homeotic genes in flies. In mammals, there are four copies of the Hox genes. Each set of Hox genes are paralogous to the others (Hox1a is a paralogue of Hox1b, etc.) These paralogs show overlapping expression patterns and could act redundantly. However, double mutations in paralogous genes can also act synergistically indicating that the genes must work together for function.

'''Shamanism''' is a practice that involves a practitioner reaching [[altered state of consciousness|altered states of consciousness]] in order to perceive and interact with what they believe to be a spirit world and channel these transcendental energies into this world.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hop87|Hoppál 1987]].  p. 76.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''shaman''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ʃ|ɑː|m|ə|n}} {{respell|SHAH|men}}, {{IPAc-en|ˈ|ʃ|æ|m|ə|n}} or {{IPAc-en|ˈ|ʃ|eɪ|m|ə|n}})&lt;ref name=OED&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/shaman|title=Definition of Shaman by Oxford Dictionaries}}&lt;/ref&gt; is someone who is regarded as having access to, and influence in, the world of [[evocation|benevolent and malevolent spirits]], who typically enters into a [[trance|trance state]] during a [[ritual]], and practices [[divination]] and [[healing]].&lt;ref name=OED /&gt; The word "shaman" probably originates from the [[Tungusic languages|Tungusic]] [[Evenki language]] of [[North Asia]]. According to [[ethnolinguist]] [[Juha Janhunen]], "the word is attested in all of the Tungusic idioms" such as [[Negidal language|Negidal]], [[Lamut language|Lamut]], [[Udege language|Udehe]]/[[Oroch language|Orochi]], [[Nanai language|Nanai]], Ilcha, [[Orok language|Orok]], [[Manchu language|Manchu]] and [[Ulch language|Ulcha]], and "nothing seems to contradict the assumption that the meaning 'shaman' also derives from [[Proto-Tungusic]]" and may have roots that extend back in time at least two millennia.&lt;ref&gt;Juha Janhunen, Siberian shamanistic terminology, ''Suomalais-ugrilaisen Seuran toimituksia/ Memoires de la Société finno-ougrienne,'' 1986, 194: 97–98&lt;/ref&gt; The term was introduced to the west after [[Russia]]n forces [[Siege of Kazan|conquered]] the shamanistic [[Khanate of Kazan]] in 1552.

The term "shamanism" was first applied by [[Western world|Western]] anthropologists as outside observers of the ancient religion of the [[Turkic peoples|Turks]] and [[Mongols]], as well as those of the neighbouring [[Tungusic languages|Tungusic]] and [[Samoyedic languages|Samoyedic]]-speaking peoples. Upon observing more religious traditions across the world, some Western anthropologists began to also use the term in a very broad sense.  The term was used to describe unrelated magico-religious practices found within the [[ethnic religion]]s of other parts of Asia, Africa, Australasia and even completely unrelated parts of the Americas, as they believed these practices to be similar to one another.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Shamanism, Discourse, Modernity |last=Alberts |first=Thomas |publisher=Ashgate |year=2015 |isbn=9781472439864|location=Farnham|pages=73–79}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mircea Eliade]] writes, "A first definition of this complex phenomenon, and perhaps the least hazardous, will be: shamanism = 'technique of [[religious ecstasy]]'."&lt;ref name = Eli72&gt;Mircea Eliade, ''Shamanism, Archaic Techniques of Ecstasy'', Bollingen Series LXXVI, Princeton University Press 1972, pp. 3–7.&lt;/ref&gt; Shamanism encompasses the premise that shamans are intermediaries or messengers between the human world and the spirit worlds. Shamans are said to treat ailments/illness by mending the soul. Alleviating traumas affecting the soul/spirit restores the physical body of the individual to balance and wholeness. The shaman also enters [[otherworld|supernatural realms]] or [[Plane (esotericism)|dimensions]] to obtain solutions to problems afflicting the community. Shamans may visit other worlds/dimensions to bring guidance to misguided souls and to ameliorate illnesses of the human soul caused by foreign elements. The shaman operates primarily within the spiritual world, which in turn affects the human world. The restoration of balance results in the elimination of the ailment.&lt;ref name = Eli72/&gt;

Beliefs and practices that have been categorised this way as "shamanic" have attracted the interest of scholars from a wide variety of disciplines, including anthropologists, archaeologists, historians, religious studies scholars, philosophers and psychologists. Hundreds of books and [[Academic publishing#Scholarly paper|academic paper]]s on the subject have been produced, with a peer-reviewed academic journal being devoted to the study of shamanism. In the 20th century, many Westerners involved in the counter-cultural movement have created modern magico-religious practices influenced by their ideas of indigenous religions from across the world, creating what has been termed [[neoshamanism]] or the neoshamanic movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gredig|first1=Florian|title=Finding New Cosmologies|date=2009|publisher=Lit Verlag Dr. W. Hopf|location=Berlin}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has affected the development of many [[Neopaganism|neopagan]] practices, as well as faced a backlash and accusations of [[cultural appropriation]],&lt;ref name="Waveland Press"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kehoe|first1=Alice Beck|title=Shamans and religion : an anthropological exploration in critical thinking|date=2000|publisher=Waveland Press|location=Prospect Heights, Ill.|isbn=1577661621}}&lt;/ref&gt; exploitation and misrepresentation when outside observers have tried to represent cultures they do not belong to.&lt;ref name="Wernitznig2"&gt;Wernitznig, Dagmar, ''Europe's Indians, Indians in Europe: European Perceptions and Appropriations of Native American Cultures from Pocahontas to the Present''. University Press of America, 2007: p.132. "What happens further in the [[Plastic Shaman]]'s [fictitious] story is highly irritating from a perspective of cultural hegemony. The Injun elder does not only willingly share their spirituality with the white intruder but, in fact, must come to the conclusion that this intruder is as good an Indian as they are themselves. Regarding Indian spirituality, the Plastic Shaman even out-Indians the actual ones. The messianic element, which Plastic Shamanism financially draws on, is installed in the Yoda-like elder themselves. They are the ones – while melodramatically parting from their spiritual offshoot – who urge the Plastic Shaman to share their gift with the rest of the world. Thus Plastic Shamans wipe their hands clean of any megalomaniac or missionizing undertones. Licensed by the authority of an Indian elder, they now have every right to spread their wisdom, and if they make (quite more than) a buck with it, then so be it.—The neocolonial ideology attached to this scenario leaves less room for cynicism."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hobson"&gt;G.

==Terminology==

===Etymology===
[[File:Witsen's Shaman.JPG|thumb|The earliest known depiction of a Siberian shaman, by the Dutch [[Nicolaes Witsen]], 17th century. Witsen called him a "priest of the Devil" and drew clawed feet for the supposed demonic qualities.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hut01|Hutton 2001]]. p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The word "shaman" probably originates from the [[Evenki language|Evenki]] word ''šamán'', most likely from the southwestern dialect spoken by the Sym Evenki peoples.&lt;ref&gt;Juha Janhunan, Siberian shamanistic terminology, ''Memoires de la Societe finno-ougrienne'' 1986, 194:97.&lt;/ref&gt; The Tungusic term was subsequently adopted by Russians interacting with the indigenous peoples in Siberia. It is found in the memoirs of the exiled Russian churchman [[Avvakum]].&lt;ref&gt;Written before 1676, first printed in 1861; see [[#Hut01|Hutton 2001]]. p. vii.&lt;/ref&gt;

The word was brought to Western Europe in the late 17th century by the Dutch traveler [[Nicolaes Witsen]], who reported his stay and journeys among the [[Tungusic languages|Tungusic]] and [[Samoyedic languages|Samoyedic]]-speaking [[indigenous peoples of Siberia]] in his book ''Noord en Oost Tataryen'' (1692).&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hut01|Hutton 2001]], p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Adam Brand (explorer)|Adam Brand]], a merchant from [[Lübeck]], published in 1698 his account of a Russian embassy to China; a translation of his book, published the same year, introduced the word ''shaman'' to English speakers.&lt;ref&gt;Adam Brand, ''Driejaarige Reize naar China'', Amsterdam 1698; transl. ''A Journal of an Ambassy'', London 1698; see Laufer B., "Origin of the Word Shaman," ''American Anthropologist,'' 19 (1917): 361–71 and Bremmer J., "Travelling souls? Greek shamanism reconsidered", in Bremmer J.N. (ed.), ''The Rise and Fall of the Afterlife,'' London: Routledge, 2002, pp. 7–40. ([http://theol.eldoc.ub.rug.nl/FILES/root/2002/594/c3.pdf PDF] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202222218/http://theol.eldoc.ub.rug.nl/FILES/root/2002/594/c3.pdf |date=2013-12-02 }})&lt;/ref&gt;

The etymology of the Evenki word is sometimes connected to a Tungus root ''ša-'' "to know".&lt;ref name="cogmap"&gt;Hoppál 2005: 15&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Diószegi 1962:13"&gt;Diószegi 1962: 13&lt;/ref&gt; This has been questioned on linguistic grounds: "The possibility cannot be completely rejected, but neither should it be accepted without reservation since the assumed derivational relationship is phonologically irregular (note especially the vowel quantities)."&lt;ref&gt;Januhnan, 1986: 98.&lt;/ref&gt; Other scholars assert that the word comes directly from the [[Manchu language]], and as such would be the only commonly used English word that is a loan from this language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Crossley|first=Pamela Kyle|title=The Manchus|publisher=Blackwell Publishers|year=1996|isbn=1557865604}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, [[Mircea Eliade]] noted that the [[Sanskrit]] word ''[[sramana|śramaṇa]],'' designating a wandering monastic or holy figure, has spread to many Central Asian languages along with [[Buddhism]] and could be the ultimate origin of the Tungusic word.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Eliade |first=Mircea |author-link=Mircea Eliade |year=1989 |title=Shamanism |publisher=Arkana Books |page =495}}&lt;/ref&gt; This proposal has been thoroughly critiqued since 1917. Ethnolinguist Juha Janhunen regards it as an "anachronism" and an "impossibility" that is nothing more than a "far-fetched etymology."&lt;ref&gt;Janhunen, 1986:98.&lt;/ref&gt;

21st-century anthropologist and archeologist Silvia Tomaskova argues that by the mid-1600s, many Europeans applied the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] term ''[[shaitan]]'' (meaning "devil") to the non-Christian practices and beliefs of indigenous peoples beyond the [[Ural Mountains]].&lt;ref&gt;Tomaskova, 2013, 76–78, 104–105.&lt;/ref&gt; She suggests that ''shaman'' may have entered the various Tungus dialects as a corruption of this term, and then been told to [[Christian missionaries]], explorers, soldiers and colonial administrators with whom the people had increasing contact for centuries. [[Ethnolinguist]]s did not develop as a discipline nor achieve contact with these communities until the late 19th century, and may have mistakenly "read backward" in time for the origin of this word.

A {{vanchor|shamaness}} (female shaman) is sometimes called a ''{{vanchor|shamanka}}'', which is not an actual indigenous term but simply ''shaman'' plus the Russian [[suffix]] ''{{wikt-lang|ru|-ка|-ka}}'' (for [[feminine (grammer)|feminine]] nouns).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chadwick|first1=Hector Munro|last2=Chadwick|first2=Nora Kershaw|title=The Growth of Literature|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bgq0AAAAIAAJ|year=1968|publisher=The University Press|page=13|quote= The terms ''shaman'' and the [[Russian language|Russian]]ised feminine form ''shamanka'', 'shamaness', '[[seeress]]', are in general use to denote any persons of the native professional class among the heathen [[Siberians]] and [[Tatars]] generally, and there can be no that they have come to be applied to a large number of different classes of people.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no single agreed-upon definition for the word "shamanism" among anthropologists. The English historian [[Ronald Hutton]] noted that by the dawn of the 21st century, there were four separate definitions of the term which appeared to be in use. The first of these uses the term to refer to "anybody who contacts a spirit world while in an altered state of consciousness." The second definition limits the term to refer to those who contact a spirit world while in an altered state of consciousness at the behest of others. The third definition attempts to distinguish shamans from other magico-religious specialists who are believed to contact spirits, such as "[[mediumship|medium]]s", "[[witch doctor]]s", "spiritual healers" or "prophets," by claiming that shamans undertake some particular technique not used by the others. Problematically, scholars advocating the third view have failed to agree on what the defining technique should be. The fourth definition identified by Hutton uses "shamanism" to refer to the indigenous religions of Siberia and neighboring parts of Asia.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hut01|Hutton 2001]]. pp. vii–viii.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Golomt Center for Shamanic Studies, a Mongolian organisation of shamans, the Evenk word ''shaman'' would more accurately be translated as "priest".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tengerism.org/table_of_contents.html|title=Circle of Tengerism|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130126071823/http://www.tengerism.org/table_of_contents.html|archivedate=2013-01-26|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Initiation and learning==
Shamans may be called through dreams or signs. However, shamanic powers may be inherited. In traditional societies shamanic training varies in length, but generally takes years.

Turner and colleagues&lt;ref&gt;Turner et al., p. 440&lt;/ref&gt; mention a phenomenon called shamanistic initiatory crisis, a [[rite of passage]] for shamans-to-be, commonly involving physical illness and/or psychological crisis. The significant role of initiatory illnesses in the calling of a shaman can be found in the detailed case history of [[Oroqen people#Religion|Chuonnasuan]], who was the last master shaman among the Tungus peoples in [[Northeast China]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#NoSh04|Noll &amp; Shi 2004]] (avail. [http://www.desales.edu/assets/desales/SocScience/Oroqen_shaman_FSSForumAug07.pdf online])&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[wounded healer]] is an [[archetype]] for a shamanic trial and journey. This process is important to the young shaman. They undergo a type of sickness that pushes them to the brink of death. This happens for two reasons:
* The shaman crosses over to the underworld. This happens so the shaman can venture to its depths to bring back vital information for the sick and the tribe.
* The shaman must become sick to understand sickness. When the shaman overcomes their own sickness, they will hold the cure to heal all that suffer. This is the uncanny mark of the wounded healer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Halifax | first = Joan |authorlink = Joan Halifax |title = Shaman: The Wounded Healer |publisher = [[Thames &amp; Hudson]] |year = 1982 |location = London |isbn = 9780500810293 |oclc = 8800269}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Roles ==
[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Een shamaan op Zuid-Boeroe bezweert boze geesten de kinderen te verlaten waarbij hij een geldstuk en een sirihnoot offert TMnr 10001031.jpg|thumb|[[Maluku Islands|South Moluccan]] shaman [[exorcising]] evil spirits occupying children, [[Buru]], [[Indonesia]] (1920)]]

Shamans claim to gain knowledge and the power to heal by entering into the [[Spirit world (Spiritualism)|spiritual world]] or dimension. Most shamans have [[dream]]s or [[Vision (spirituality)|visions]] that convey certain messages. The shaman may have or acquire many [[spirit guides]], who often guide and direct the shaman in their travels in the spirit world. These spirit guides are always present within the shaman, although others encounter them only when the shaman is in a [[trance]]. The spirit guide energizes the shaman, enabling them to enter the spiritual dimension. The shaman heals within the spiritual dimension by returning 'lost' parts of the human soul from wherever they have gone. The shaman also cleanses excess negative energies, which confuse or pollute the soul.

Shamans act as [[Mediation|mediators]] in their culture.&lt;ref name=mediator&gt;Hoppál 2005: 45&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mediator2&gt;Boglár 2001: 24&lt;/ref&gt; The shaman communicates with the spirits on behalf of the community, including the spirits of the deceased. The shaman communicates with both living and dead to alleviate unrest, unsettled issues, and to deliver gifts to the spirits.

Among the [[Selkup people|Selkups]], the [[Merginae|sea duck]] is a spirit animal. Ducks fly in the air and dive in the water. Thus ducks are believed to belong to both the upper world and the world below.&lt;ref name="Hoppal_a"&gt;Hoppál 2005: 94&lt;/ref&gt; Among other Siberian peoples, these characteristics are attributed to water fowl in general.&lt;ref&gt;Vitebsky 1996: 46&lt;/ref&gt; The upper world is the afterlife primarily associated with deceased humans and is believed to be accessed by soul journeying through a portal in the sky. The lower world or "world below" is the afterlife primarily associated with animals and is believed to be accessed by soul journeying through a portal in the earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ingerman |first=Sandra |date=2004 |title=Shamanic Journeying: A Beginner's Guide |url=https://www.amazon.com/Shamanic-Journeying-Beginners-Sandra-Ingerman/dp/1591799430 |publisher= Sounds True |isbn=9781591799436}}&lt;/ref&gt; In shamanic cultures many animals are regarded as spirit animals.

Shamans perform a variety of functions depending upon their respective cultures;&lt;ref name=multfunc&gt;Hoppál 2005: 25&lt;/ref&gt; healing,&lt;ref name=sem-shamheal&gt;{{cite web |last=Sem |first=Tatyana |url=http://www.museum.state.il.us/exhibits/changing/journey/healing.html |title=Shamanic Healing Rituals |publisher=Russian Museum of Ethnography}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hoppál 2005: 27–28&lt;/ref&gt; leading a [[sacrifice]],&lt;ref&gt;Hoppál 2005: 28–33&lt;/ref&gt; preserving the [[tradition]] by [[storytelling]] and songs,&lt;ref name=memory&gt;Hoppál 2005: 37&lt;/ref&gt; [[fortune-telling]],&lt;ref&gt;Hoppál 2005: 34–35&lt;/ref&gt; and acting as a [[psychopomp]] ("guide of souls").&lt;ref name=psychopomp&gt;Hoppál 2005: 36&lt;/ref&gt;  A single shaman may fulfill several of these functions.&lt;ref name="multfunc" /&gt;

The functions of a shaman may include either guiding to their proper abode the souls of the dead (which may be guided either one-at-a-time or in a cumulative group, depending on culture), and/or curing (healing) of ailments. The ailments may be either purely physical afflictions—such as disease, which may be cured by gifting, flattering, threatening, or wrestling the disease-spirit (sometimes trying all these, sequentially), and which may be completed by displaying a supposedly extracted token of the disease-spirit (displaying this, even if "fraudulent", is supposed to impress the disease-spirit that it has been, or is in the process of being, defeated, so that it will retreat and stay out of the patient's body), or else mental (including psychosomatic) afflictions—such as persistent terror (on account of a frightening experience), which may be likewise cured by similar methods. In most languages a different term other than the one translated "shaman" is usually applied to a religious official leading sacrificial rites ("priest"), or to a raconteur ("sage") of traditional lore; there may be more of an overlap in functions (with that of a shaman), however, in the case of an interpreter of omens or of dreams.

There are distinct types of shaman who perform more specialized functions. For example, among the [[Nani people]], a distinct kind of shaman acts as a [[psychopomp]].&lt;ref&gt;Hoppál 2005:36164&lt;/ref&gt; Other specialized shamans may be distinguished according to the type of spirits, or realms of the spirit world, with which the shaman most commonly interacts. These roles vary among the [[Nenets people|Nenets]], [[Enets people|Enets]], and [[Selkup people|Selkup]] shaman.&lt;ref&gt;Hoppál 2005: 87–95&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/sha/sis/sis05.htm|title=Shamanism in Siberia: Part III. Religion: Chapter IX. Types of Shamans|publisher=|accessdate=6 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The assistant of an [[Oroqen people|Oroqen]] shaman (called ''jardalanin'', or "second spirit") knows many things about the associated beliefs. He or she accompanies the rituals and interprets the behavior of the shaman.&lt;ref name=Guan_Kouni&gt;[[#NoSh04|Noll &amp; Shi 2004]]: 10, footnote 10 (see [http://www.desales.edu/assets/desales/SocScience/Oroqen_shaman_FSSForumAug07.pdf online])&lt;/ref&gt; Despite these functions, the jardalanin is ''not'' a shaman. For this interpretative assistant, it would be unwelcome to fall into trance.&lt;ref name=interpreter&gt;[[#NoSh04|Noll &amp; Shi 2004]]: 8–9 (see [http://www.desales.edu/assets/desales/SocScience/Oroqen_shaman_FSSForumAug07.pdf online])&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ecological aspect==
Among the [[Tucano people]], a sophisticated system exists for [[environmental resources management]] and for avoiding resource depletion through overhunting. This system is conceptualized mythologically and symbolically by the belief that breaking hunting restrictions may cause illness. As the primary teacher of tribal symbolism, the shaman may have a leading role in this [[Ecology|ecological]] management, actively restricting hunting and fishing. The shaman is able to "release" game animals, or their souls, from their hidden abodes.&lt;ref name=eco&gt;Reichel-Dolmatoff 1997&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vitebsky 1996: 107&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Piaroa people]] have ecological concerns related to shamanism.&lt;ref name=ecopia/&gt; Among the [[Inuit]], shamans fetch the souls of game from remote places,&lt;ref&gt;Merkur 1985: 5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vitebsky 1996: 108&lt;/ref&gt; or [[soul travel]] to ask for game from mythological beings like the [[Sedna (mythology)|Sea Woman]].&lt;ref&gt;Kleivan &amp; Sonne: 27–28&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economics==
The way shamans get sustenance and take part in everyday life varies across cultures. In many Inuit groups, they provide services for the community and get a "due payment" (cultures),{{who|date=February 2012}} believe the payment is given to the helping spirits&lt;ref name=mshare/&gt; but these goods are only "welcome addenda." They are not enough to enable shamanizing as a full-time activity. Shamans live like any other member of the group, as a hunter or housewife. Due to the popularity of [[ayahuasca tourism]] in South America, there are practitioners in areas frequented by backpackers who make a living from leading ceremonies.&lt;ref name="failed-shaman"&gt;Kleivan &amp; Sonne 1985: 24&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mshare&gt;Merkur 1985: 3&lt;/ref&gt;

==Beliefs==
There are many variations of shamanism throughout the world, but several common beliefs are shared by all forms of shamanism. Common beliefs identified by [[Mircea Eliade|Eliade]] (1972)&lt;ref name = Eli72/&gt; are the following:

* Spirits exist and they play important roles both in individual lives and in human society.
* The shaman can communicate with the spirit world.
* Spirits can be benevolent or malevolent.
* The shaman can treat sickness caused by malevolent spirits.
* The shaman can employ [[trance]] inducing techniques to incite visionary ecstasy and go on [[vision quest]]s.
* The shaman's spirit can leave the body to enter the [[supernatural]] world to search for answers.
* The shaman evokes animal images as [[spirit guides]], [[omen]]s, and message-bearers.
* The shaman can perform other varied forms of [[divination]], [[scry]], throw bones/[[runes]], and sometimes foretell of future events.

Shamanism is based on the premise that the visible world is pervaded by invisible forces or spirits which affect the lives of the living.&lt;ref name=Peru&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kirasalak.com/Peru.html |title=Hell and Back |last=Salak |first=Kira |publisher=National Geographic Adventure }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the causes of disease lie in the spiritual realm, inspired by malicious spirits, both spiritual and physical methods are used to heal. Commonly, a shaman "enters the body" of the patient to confront the spiritual infirmity and heals by banishing the infectious spirit.

Many shamans have expert knowledge of medicinal plants native to their area, and an herbal treatment is often prescribed. In many places shamans learn directly from the plants, harnessing their effects and healing properties, after obtaining permission from the indwelling or patron spirits. In the Peruvian Amazon Basin, shamans and ''[[curandero]]s'' use medicine songs called ''[[icaro]]s'' to evoke spirits. Before a spirit can be summoned it must teach the shaman its song.&lt;ref name="Peru" /&gt; The use of [[totem]]ic items such as rocks with special powers and an [[Animism|animating spirit]] is common.

Such practices are presumably very ancient. [[Plato]] wrote in his ''[[Phaedrus (dialogue)|Phaedrus]]'' that the "first prophecies were the words of an oak", and that those who lived at that time found it rewarding enough to "listen to an oak or a stone, so long as it was telling the truth".

Belief in witchcraft and sorcery, known as ''[[brujería]]'' in Latin America, exists in many societies. Other societies assert all shamans have the power to both cure and kill. Those with shamanic knowledge usually enjoy great power and prestige in the community, but they may also be regarded suspiciously or fearfully as potentially harmful to others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor-last1=Whitehead|editor-first1=Neil L.|editor-last2=Wright|editor-first2=Robin|title=In Darkness and Secrecy: The Anthropology of Assault Sorcery and Witchcraft in Amazonia|date=2004|publisher=Duke University Press|location=Durham, NC|isbn=978-0-8223-3333-3|doi=10.1215/9780822385837}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By engaging in their work, a shaman is exposed to significant personal risk, from the spirit world, from enemy shamans, or from the means employed to alter the shaman's [[state of consciousness]].  Shamanic plant materials can be toxic or fatal if misused. [[Spell (paranormal)|Spell]]s are commonly used to protect against these dangers, and the use of more dangerous plants is often very highly ritualized.

===Soul and spirit concepts===
{{See also|Soul dualism}}
The variety of functions described above may seem like distinct tasks, but they may be united by underlying soul and spirit concepts.

;[[Soul (spirit)|Soul]]
:This concept can generally explain more, seemingly unassociated phenomena in shamanism:&lt;ref name=all-soul&gt;[[#Mer85|Merkur 1985]]: 4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Vit96|Vitebsky 1996]]: 11, 12–14, 107&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=soulsham&gt;[[#Hop05|Hoppál 2005]]: 27, 30, 36&lt;/ref&gt;

;[[Healing]]
:This concept may be based closely on the soul concepts of the belief system of the people served by the shaman.&lt;ref name=sem-shamheal/&gt; It may consist of retrieving the lost soul of the ill person.&lt;ref name=resoul&gt;Hoppál 2005: 27&lt;/ref&gt; See also the [[soul dualism]] concept.

;[[Scarcity]] of hunted game
:This problem can be solved by "releasing" the souls of the animals from their hidden abodes. Besides that, many [[taboo]]s may prescribe the behavior of people towards game, so that the souls of the animals do not feel angry or hurt, or the pleased soul of the already killed prey can tell the other, still living animals, that they can allow themselves to be caught and killed.&lt;ref&gt;Kleivan &amp; Sonne 1985: 7, 19–21&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Gab-KarEszk&gt;Gabus, Jean: A karibu eszkimók. Gondolat Kiadó, Budapest, 1970. (Hungarian translation of the original: Vie et coutumes des Esquimaux Caribous, Libraire Payot Lausanne, 1944.) It describes the life of Caribou Eskimo groups.&lt;/ref&gt; For the ecological aspects of shamanistic practice, and related beliefs, see below.

;[[Infertility]] of women
:This problem can be cured by obtaining the soul of the expected child.

;[[Spirit]]s
:Beliefs related to [[spirit]]s can explain many different phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hop07c|Hoppál 2007c]]: 18&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the importance of  [[storytelling]], or acting as a singer, can be understood better if we examine the whole belief system. A person who can memorize long texts or songs, and play an instrument, may be regarded as the beneficiary of contact with the spirits (e.g. [[Khanty people]]).&lt;ref name=singtellplay&gt;Hoppál 2005: 99&lt;/ref&gt;

==Practice==
{{See also|Religious ecstasy}}
Generally, the shaman traverses the [[axis mundi]] and enters the spirit world by effecting a transition of consciousness, entering into an [[Religious ecstasy|ecstatic]] [[trance]], either [[Autosuggestion|autohypnotically]] or through the use of [[entheogen]]s. The methods employed are diverse, and are often used together.

===Entheogens===

Some shamans observe dietary or customary restrictions particular to their tradition.  These restrictions are more than just cultural. For example, the diet followed by shamans and apprentices prior to participating in an [[ayahuasca]] ceremony includes foods rich in [[tryptophan]] (a biosynthetic precursor to [[serotonin]]) as well as avoiding foods rich in [[tyramine]], which could induce [[hypertensive crisis]] if ingested with [[MAOI]]s such as are found in ayahuasca brews as well as abstinence from alcohol or sex.&lt;ref name="Peru" /&gt;

===Music and songs===
{{See also|Shamanic music|Imitation of sounds in shamanism}}
Just like shamanism itself,&lt;ref name="cogmap"/&gt; music and songs related to it in various cultures are diverse, far from being alike. In several instances,  songs related to shamanism are intended to imitate [[natural sounds]], via [[onomatopoeia]].&lt;ref name=onom&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dasa.baua.de/nn_35984/sid_2C8A99B3F31A58C62BBE3312986DC568/nsc_true/de/Presse/Pressematerialien/Sonderausstellung_20Macht_20Musik/Schamanen-Musik.pdf |title=healthCheck |publisher= |accessdate=6 June 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402105719/http://dasa.baua.de/nn_35984/sid_2C8A99B3F31A58C62BBE3312986DC568/nsc_true/de/Presse/Pressematerialien/Sonderausstellung_20Macht_20Musik/Schamanen-Musik.pdf |archivedate=2 April 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Much fascination surrounds the role that the acoustics of the drum play to the shaman. Shaman drums are generally constructed of an animal-skin stretched over a bent wooden hoop, with a handle across the hoop.

===Cognitive, semiotic, hermeneutic approaches===
A debated etymology of the word "shaman" is "one who knows",&lt;ref name="Diószegi 1962:13" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hoppál 2005:14"&gt;Hoppál 2005: 14&lt;/ref&gt; implying, among other things, that the shaman is an expert in keeping together the multiple [[code]]s of the society, and that to be effective, shamans must maintain a comprehensive view in their mind which gives them certainty of [[knowledge]].&lt;ref name="cogmap"/&gt; According to this view, the shaman uses (and the audience understands) multiple [[code]]s, expressing meanings in many ways: verbally, musically, artistically, and in dance. Meanings may be manifested in objects such as [[amulet]]s.&lt;ref name="Hoppál 2005:14"/&gt; If the shaman knows the [[culture]] of his or her community well,&lt;ref name="mediator2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Pen95|Pentikäinen 1995]]: 270&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=knowncult&gt;Hoppál 2005: 25–26,43&lt;/ref&gt; and acts accordingly, their audience will know the used [[symbol]]s and meanings and therefore trust the shamanic worker.&lt;ref name=knowncult/&gt;&lt;ref name=etym2&gt;Hoppál 2004: 14&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also [[Semiotics|semiotic]], theoretical approaches to shamanism,&lt;ref name=semi&gt;Hoppál 2005: 13–15, 58, 197&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hoppál 2006a: 11&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hoppál 2006b: 175&lt;/ref&gt; and examples of "mutually opposing symbols" in academic studies of Siberian lore, distinguishing a "white" shaman who contacts sky spirits for good aims by day, from a "black" shaman who contacts evil spirits for bad aims by night.&lt;ref name=semiotics_of_shamanism&gt;[[#Hop07c|Hoppál 2007c]]: 24–25&lt;/ref&gt; (Series of such opposing symbols referred to a world-view behind them. Analogously to the way grammar arranges words to express meanings and convey a world, also this formed a cognitive map).&lt;ref name="cogmap" /&gt;&lt;ref name=hop-natworsib&gt;Hoppál, Mihály: [http://www.folklore.ee/folklore/vol4/hoppal.htm Nature worship in Siberian shamanism]&lt;/ref&gt; Shaman's lore is rooted in the folklore of the community, which provides a "mythological mental map".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hop07b|Hoppál 2007b]]: 12–13&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hoppál 2007c 25"&gt;[[#Hop07c|Hoppál 2007c]]: 25&lt;/ref&gt; [[Juha Pentikäinen]] uses the concept ''"grammar of mind"''.&lt;ref name="Hoppál 2007c 25"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Pen95|Pentikäinen 1995]]: 270–271&lt;/ref&gt;

Armin Geertz coined and introduced the [[hermeneutics]],&lt;ref&gt;Merkur 1985: v&lt;/ref&gt; or "ethnohermeneutics",&lt;ref name=hop-natworsib/&gt; interpretation. Hoppál extended the term to include not only the interpretation of oral and written texts, but that of "visual texts as well (including motions, gestures and more complex ritual, and ceremonies performed for instance by shamans)".&lt;ref name=ethnohermeneutics&gt;[[#Hop07b|Hoppál 2007b]]: 13&lt;/ref&gt; Revealing the [[Animism|animistic]] views in shamanism, but also their relevance to the contemporary world, where ecological problems have validated paradigms of balance and protection.&lt;ref name="Hoppál 2007c 25"/&gt;

David Lewis-Williams explains the origins of shamanic practice, and some of its precise forms, through aspects of human consciousness evinced in cave art and LSD experiments alike.&lt;ref&gt;David Lewis-Williams, ''The Mind in the Cave: Consciousness and the Origins of Art'' (London: Thames and Hudson, 2002)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ecological approaches, systems theory===
[[Gerardo Reichel-Dolmatoff]] relates these concepts to developments in the ways that modern science (systems theory, ecology, new approaches in anthropology and archeology) treats [[causality]] in a less linear fashion.&lt;ref name=eco/&gt; He also suggests a cooperation of modern science and indigenous lore.&lt;ref name=coop&gt;[[Gerardo Reichel-Dolmatoff]]: [https://web.archive.org/web/20041027152526/http://www.theecologist.info/page9.html A View from the Headwaters]. The Ecologist, Vol. 29 No. 4, July 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hypotheses on origins===
Shamanic practices may originate as early as the [[Paleolithic]], predating all organized religions,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bradshawfoundation.com/clottes/page7.php |title=Shamanism in Prehistory |author=Jean Clottes |accessdate=2008-03-11 |work=Bradshaw foundation |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080430093540/http://www.bradshawfoundation.com/clottes/page7.php |archivedate=2008-04-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Narr&gt;{{cite web |url=http://concise.britannica.com/oscar/print?articleId=109434&amp;fullArticle=true&amp;tocId=52333 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080409074119/http://concise.britannica.com/oscar/print?articleId=109434&amp;fullArticle=true&amp;tocId=52333 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2008-04-09 |author=Karl J. Narr |title=Prehistoric religion |accessdate=2008-03-28 |work=Britannica online encyclopedia 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and certainly as early as the [[Neolithic]] period.&lt;ref name=Narr/&gt;  The earliest known undisputed burial of a shaman (and by extension the earliest undisputed evidence of shamans and shamanic practices) dates back to the early [[Upper Paleolithic|Upper Paleolithic era]] (c. 30,000 BP) in what is now the Czech Republic.&lt;ref&gt;Tedlock, Barbara. 2005. The Woman in the Shaman's Body: Reclaiming the Feminine in Religion and Medicine. New York: Bantam&lt;/ref&gt;

Sanskrit scholar and comparative mythologist [[Michael Witzel]] proposes that all of the world's mythologies, and also the concepts and practices of shamans, can be traced to the migrations of two prehistoric populations: the "[[Gondwana]]" type (of circa 65,000 years ago) and the "[[Laurasia]]n" type (of circa 40,000 years ago).&lt;ref&gt;Witzel, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Early anthropological studies theorize that shamanism developed as a magic practice to ensure a successful hunt or gathering of food. Evidence in caves and drawings on walls support indications that shamanism started during the Paleolithic era. One such picture featured a half-animal, with the face and legs of a man, with antlers and a tail of a stag.&lt;ref&gt;Winkelman, Michael. Shamanism: a Biopsychosocial Paradigm of Consciousness and Healing. Santa Barbara, CA: Praeger, 2010. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2008, researchers from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem announced the discovery of a 12,000-year-old site in [[Pre-history of the Southern Levant|Israel]] that is perceived as one of the earliest known shaman burials. The elderly woman had been arranged on her side, with her legs apart and folded inward at the knee. Ten large stones were placed on the head, pelvis and arms. Among her unusual [[grave goods]] were 50 complete tortoise shells, a human foot, and certain body parts from animals such as a cow tail and eagle wings. Other animal remains came from a boar, leopard, and two martens. "It seems that the woman … was perceived as being in a close relationship with these animal spirits", researchers noted. The grave was one of at least 28 graves at the site, located in a cave in lower [[Galilee]] and belonging to the [[Natufian culture]], but is said to be unlike any other among the Epipaleolithic Natufians or in the Paleolithic period.&lt;ref&gt;"Earliest known shaman grave site found: study", reported by [[Reuters]] via [[Yahoo! News]], November 4, 2008, [https://www.webcitation.org/5c5MCHK7R?url=http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20081104/sc_nm/us_shaman_israel/print archived.] see ''Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Decline and revitalization / tradition-preserving movements==
Shamanism is believed to be declining around the world, possibly due to other organised religious influences, like Christianity, that want people who practice shamanism to convert to their own system and doctrine. Another reason is western views of shamanism as 'primitive', 'superstitious', backward and outdated. Whalers who frequently interact with Inuit tribes are one source of this decline in that region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Oosten|first1=Jarich|first2=Frederic |last2=Laugrand|first3=Cornelius |last3=Remie|title=Perceptions of Decline: Inuit Shamanism in the Canadian Arctic|journal=American Society for Ethnohistory|year=2006|pages=445–477|doi=10.1215/00141801-2006-001|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Kyzyl Shaman.jpg|thumb|A shaman doctor of [[Kyzyl]], 2005. Attempts are being made to preserve and revitalize [[Tuvans|Tuvan]] shamanism:&lt;ref name=tuva&gt;Hoppál 2005: 117&lt;/ref&gt; former authentic shamans have begun to practice again, and young apprentices are being educated in an organized way.&lt;ref name=authentic-revitalization-tuva&gt;Hoppál 2005: 259&lt;/ref&gt;]]

In many areas, former shamans ceased to fulfill the functions in the community they used to, as they felt mocked by their own community,&lt;ref&gt;Boglár 2001: 19–20&lt;/ref&gt; or regarded their own past as deprecated and are unwilling to talk about it to an ethnographer.&lt;ref name=shamed&gt;Diószegi 1960: 37–39&lt;/ref&gt;

Moreover, besides personal communications of former shamans,  folklore texts may narrate directly about a deterioration process. For example, a [[Buryats|Buryat]] epic text details the wonderful deeds of the ancient "first shaman" Kara-Gürgän:&lt;ref name=Kara-Gurgan&gt;[[#Eli01|Eliade 2001]]: 76 (Chpt 3 about obtaining shamanic capabilities)&lt;/ref&gt; he could even compete with God, create life, steal back the soul of the sick from God without his consent. A subsequent text laments that shamans of older times were stronger, possessing capabilities like [[omnividence]],&lt;ref name=flatland&gt;Omnividence: A word created by Edwin A. Abbott in his book titled [[Flatland]]&lt;/ref&gt; fortune-telling even for decades in the future, moving as fast as a bullet.&lt;ref name=deter&gt;Diószegi 1960: 88–89&lt;/ref&gt;

In most affected areas, shamanic practices ceased to exist, with authentic shamans dying and their personal experiences dying with them. The loss of memories is not always lessened by the fact the shaman is not always the only person in a community who knows the beliefs and motives related to the local shaman-hood (laics know myths as well, among Barasana, even though less;&lt;ref name=barasana-myths&gt;Stephen Hugh-Jones 1980: 32&lt;/ref&gt; there are former shaman apprentices unable to complete the learning among Greenlandic Inuit peoples,&lt;ref name="failed-shaman"/&gt; moreover, even laics can have trance-like experiences among the Inuit;&lt;ref name=Mer-BecHalfHid/&gt; the assistant of a shaman can be extremely knowledgeable among [[Dagara people|Dagara]]).&lt;ref name=Guan_Kouni/&gt;&lt;ref name=interpreter/&gt; Although the shaman is often believed and trusted precisely because s/he "accommodates" to the "grammar" of the beliefs of the community,&lt;ref name=knowncult/&gt; several parts of the knowledge related to the local shamanhood consist of personal experiences of the shaman (illness), or root in his/her family life (the interpretation of the symbolics of his/her drum),&lt;ref name=drum-symbols&gt;Hoppál 2005: 224&lt;/ref&gt; thus, those are lost with his/her death. Besides that, in many cultures, the entire traditional belief system has become endangered (often together with a partial or total [[language shift]]), the other people of the community remembering the associated beliefs and practices (or the language at all) grew old or died, many folklore memories (songs, texts) were forgotten – which may threaten even such peoples who could preserve their isolation until the middle of the 20th century, like the [[Nganasan people|Nganasan]].&lt;ref&gt;Nagy 1998: 232&lt;/ref&gt;

Some areas could enjoy a prolonged resistance due to their remoteness.
* Variants of [[shamanism among Inuit peoples]] were once a widespread (and very diverse) phenomenon, but today are rarely practiced, as well as already having been in decline among many groups, even while the first major ethnological research was being done,&lt;ref&gt;Merkur 1985: 132&lt;/ref&gt; e.g. among Polar Inuit, at the end of the 19th century, [[Sagloq]], the last shaman who was believed to be able to travel to the sky and under the sea died—and many other former shamanic capacities were lost during that time as well, like [[ventriloquism]] and [[sleight-of-hand]].&lt;ref&gt;Merkur 1985: 134&lt;/ref&gt;
* The isolated location of [[Nganasan people]] allowed shamanism to be a living phenomenon among them even at the beginning of the 20th century,&lt;ref name=hop&gt;Hoppál 2005: 92&lt;/ref&gt; the last notable Nganasan shaman's ceremonies could be recorded on film in the 1970s.&lt;ref name="Hoppal"&gt;Hoppál 1994: 62&lt;/ref&gt;

After exemplifying the general decline even in the most remote areas, it should be noted that there are revitalization or tradition-preserving efforts as a response. Besides collecting the memories,&lt;ref name=collect&gt;Hoppál 2005: 88&lt;/ref&gt; there are also tradition-preserving&lt;ref&gt;Hoppál 2005: 93&lt;/ref&gt; and even revitalization efforts,&lt;ref&gt;Hoppál 2005: 111, 117–119, 128, 132, 133–134, 252–263&lt;/ref&gt; led by authentic former shamans (for example among [[Sakha people]]&lt;ref name=authentic-revitalization-sakha&gt;Hoppál 2005: 257–258&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Tuvans]]).&lt;ref name=authentic-revitalization-tuva/&gt; However, according to Richard L. Allen, research &amp; policy analyst for the [[Cherokee Nation]], they are overwhelmed with [[plastic shaman|fraudulent shamans]] ("plastic medicine people").&lt;ref&gt;Hagan, Helene E. [http://www.sonomacountyfreepress.com/features/spirg-hagan.html "The Plastic Medicine People Circle."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130305155048/http://www.sonomacountyfreepress.com/features/spirg-hagan.html |date=2013-03-05 }} ''Sonoma Free County Press.'' Accessed 31 Jan 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; "One may assume that anyone claiming to be a Cherokee 'shaman, spiritual healer, or pipe-carrier', is equivalent to a modern day medicine show and snake-oil vendor."&lt;ref name=RG&gt;{{cite web | title = Pseudo Shamans Cherokee Statement| url = http://www.thepeoplespaths.net/Articles2001/RLAllen-CherokeeStatement-Shamans.htm| accessdate = 2008-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; One indicator of a plastic shaman might be someone who discusses "Native American spirituality" but does not mention any specific [[federally recognized tribes|Native American tribe]]. The "New Age Frauds and Plastic Shamans" website discusses potentially plastic shamans.&lt;ref&gt;Lupa 37&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides tradition-preserving efforts, there are also [[Neoshamanism|neoshamanistic]] movements, these may differ from many traditional shamanistic practice and beliefs in several points.&lt;ref name=neoshaman&gt;Vitebsky 1996: 150–153&lt;/ref&gt; Admittedly,{{According to whom|date=February 2012}} several traditional beliefs systems indeed have ecological considerations (for example, many Inuit peoples), and among [[Tukano people]], the shaman indeed has direct resource-protecting roles, see details in section [[#Ecological aspect|Ecological aspect]].

Today, shamanism survives primarily among [[indigenous people]]s. Shamanic practices continue today in the [[tundra]]s, jungles, deserts, and other rural areas, and even in cities, towns, suburbs, and [[shantytowns]] all over the world. This is especially true for Africa and South America, where "[[mestizo]] shamanism" is widespread.

==Regional variations==

===Asia===

====Vietnam====
{{Main|Lên đồng}}
Shamanism is part of the [[Vietnamese religion]] of [[Đạo Mẫu]]. In Vietnam, this ritual practice is called [[Lên đồng]] or also known as ''hầu bóng'', or ''hầu đồng'', sessions involve a number of artistic elements, such as music, singing, dance and the use of costumes. 

====Hmong shamanism====
{{Main|Hmong customs and culture#Shamanism}}
The [[Hmong people]], as an ancient people of China with a 5,000-year history, continue to maintain and practice its form of shamanism known as [[Ua Neeb]] in mainland Asia. At the end of the [[Vietnam War]], some 300,000 Hmong have been settled across the globe. They have continued to practice Ua Neeb in various countries in North and South America, Europe and Australia. In the U.S., the Hmong shaman practitioner is known as ''Txiv Neeb'' has been licensed by many hospitals in California as being part of the medical health team to treat patients in hospital. This revival of Ua Neeb in the West has been brought great success and has been hailed in the media as "doctor for the disease, shaman for the soul".{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}

Being a Hmong shaman represents a true vocation, chosen by the shaman God, Sivyis.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lexicon.net/drpao/shaman/sivyis/{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The shaman's main job is to bring harmony to the individual, their family, and their community within their environment by performing various rituals (usually through trance).

[[Animal sacrifice]] has been part of the Hmong shamanic practice for the past 5,000 years.  Contrary to the belief of many Westerners, the Hmong practice of using animals in shamanic practice is performed with great respect. After the Vietnam War, over 200,000 Hmong were resettled in the United States and shamanism is still part of the Hmong culture. Due the colliding of culture and the law, as Professor Alison Dundes Renteln, a political science professor at the University of Southern California and author of ''The Cultural Defense'', a book that examines the influence of such cases on U.S. courts, once said,  "We say that as a society we welcome diversity, and in fact that we embrace it&amp;nbsp;... In practice, it's not that easy".&lt;ref name="usatoday.com"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.usatoday.com/educate/firstamendment/religion_052504.html |author=Richard Willing |title=Courts asked to consider culture An act defined as crime in USA may be common in other places. Should justice system take that into account? | work=USA Today |accessdate=2004-11-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hmong believe that all things on Earth have a soul (or multiple souls), and those souls are treated as equal and can be considered interchangeable. When a person is sick due to his soul being lost, or captured by wild spirit, it is necessary to ask for and receive permission of that animal, whether it is a chicken, pig, dog, goat or any other animals required, to use its soul for an exchange with the afflicted person's soul for a period of 12 months. At the end of that period, during the [[Hmong New Year]], the shaman would perform a special ritual to release the soul of that animal and send it off to the world beyond. As part of his service to mankind, the animal soul is sent off to be reincarnated into a higher form of animal, or even to become a member of a god's family (ua Fuab Tais Ntuj tus tub, tus ntxhais) to live a life of luxury, free of the suffering as an animal. Hence, being asked to perform this duty (what is known in the West as "animal sacrifice") is one of the greatest honors for that animal, to be able to serve mankind. The Hmong of southeast [[Guizhou]] will cover the rooster with a piece of red cloth and then hold it up to worship and sacrifice to the Heaven and the Earth before the [[Rooster#Religion and spiritual belief systems|Sacred cockfight]].&lt;ref&gt;Southeast Guizhou Travel Tips – China Highlights, a division of CITS Guilin, a full service China travel agency providing China Tours&lt;/ref&gt;   In a 2010 trial of a Sheboygan Wisconsin Hmong who was charged with staging a cockfight, it was stated that the roosters were "kept for both food and religious purposes",&lt;ref name="Midwest Communications Inc"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whbl.com/news/articles/2010/apr/08/day-one-cockfighting-trial-books/|title=Day One of Cockfighting Trial Concludes|author=Midwest Communications Inc.|work=whbl|accessdate=6 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the case was followed by an acquittal.&lt;ref name="Midwest Communications Inc"/&gt;

In addition to the spiritual dimension, Hmong shaman attempt to treat many physical illnesses through use of the text of sacred words (khawv koob).

====Japan====

{{Further|Shinto|Ainu religion|Ryukyuan religion}}
Shamanism is part of the indigenous Ainu religion and Japanese religion of [[Shinto]], although Shinto is distinct in that it is shamanism for an agricultural society. Since the early middle-ages Shinto has been influenced by and [[syncretism|syncretized]] with Buddhism and other elements of continental East Asian culture.

====Korea====
{{Main|Korean shamanism}}
Shamanism is still practiced in [[North Korea|North]] and [[South Korea]].  In the south, shaman women are known as ''mudangs'', while male shamans are referred to as ''baksoo mudangs''.

A person can become a shaman through hereditary title or through natural ability. Shamans are consulted in contemporary society for financial and marital decisions.

The spiritual hierarchy in clan-based Mongolian society was complex. The highest group consisted of 99 ''[[tngri]]'' (55 of them benevolent or "white" and 44 terrifying or "black"), 77 ''natigai'' or "earth-mothers", besides others. The ''tngri'' were called upon only by leaders and great shamans and were common to all the clans. After these, three groups of ancestral spirits dominated. The "Lord-Spirits" were the souls of clan leaders to whom any member of a clan could appeal for physical or spiritual help. The "Protector-Spirits" included the souls of great shamans (''ĵigari'') and shamanesses (''abĵiya''). The "Guardian-Spirits" were made up of the souls of smaller shamans (''böge'') and shamanesses (''idugan'') and were associated with a specific locality (including mountains, rivers, etc.) in the clan's territory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hesse|first=Klaus|year=1987|title=On the History of Mongolian Shamanism in Anthropological Perspective|journal=Anthropos|volume=82|issue=4–6|pages=403–13|jstor=40463470}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1990s, a form of Mongolian neo-shamanism was created which has given a more modern approach to shamanism. Among the Buryat Mongols, who live in Mongolia and Russia, the proliferation of shamans since 1990 is a core aspect of a larger struggle for the Buryats to reestablish their historical and genetic roots, as has been documented extensively by [[Ippei Shimamura]], an anthropologist at the University of Shiga Prefecture in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shimamura|first1=Ippei|title=The Roots seekers: Shamanism and Ethnicity Among the Mongol Buryats|date=2014|location=Kanagawa, Japan|isbn=978-4-86110-397-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some Mongolian shamans are now making a business out of their profession and even have offices in the larger towns. At these businesses, a shaman generally heads the organization and performs services such as healing, fortunetelling, and solving all kinds of problems.&lt;ref&gt;Balogh, Matyas. "Contemporary Shamanisms in Mongolia." ''Asian Ethnicity'' 11.2 (2010): 229–38.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the initial enthusiasm for the revival of Mongol shamanism in the post-communist/post-1990 era led to an openness to all interested visitors, the situation has changed among those Mongols seeking to protect the essential ethnic or national basis of their practices. In recent years many associations of Mongol shamans have become wary of Western "core" or "neo" or "New Age" shamans and have restricted access to only to Mongols and Western scholars. One such event, organized by Jargalsaichan, the head of the Corporate Union of Mongolian Shamans, was the 21 June 2017 Ulaan Tergel (summer solstice) celebration held near midnight on the steppes about 20&amp;nbsp;km outside Ulaanbaatar. Although a private event, two Western psychologist scholars of shamanism, [[Richard Noll]] and [[Leonard George]] were allowed to observe, photograph and post video of the event to YouTube.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Noll|first1=Richard|title=Mongol shamans summer solstice fire ritual 21 June 2017|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5g1XTL8XbhY|website=You Tube|accessdate=4 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Philippines====

[[File:An Itneg shaman renewing an offering to the spirit shield (1922, Philippines).jpg|thumb|1922: a shaman of the [[Itneg people]] renewing an offering to the spirit (''[[anito]]'') of a warrior's ''[[kalasag]]'' shield]]
Shamans were highly respected members of the community in the ancient [[animistic]] religions of the [[Philippines]]. They were generally known as ''[[babaylan]]'' or ''baylan''. In most Filipino ethnic groups, the shamans were almost always women. The few men who gain shaman status were usually ''asog'' or ''bayok'', men who dressed as women and lived as women. They usually acquire their role either by inheriting it from an older shaman or after surviving a serious illness or a bout of insanity. Regardless of the method, full-fledged shamans are those who have acquired [[spirit familiar]]s who serve as their guides into the [[Spirit world (Spiritualism)|spirit world]].&lt;ref name="Scott1994"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hislop"/&gt;

The main role of shamans were as [[spirit medium]]s. Through the use of their familiars and various rituals, they allow their bodies to be possessed by spirits (''[[anito]]''), thus facilitating communication between the spirit world and the material world. There were different ranks and specializations of shamans among different Filipino ethnic groups. Some specialized in healing, others in prophecy, others in creating charms and spells, and so on. The most powerful were usually believed to be sorcerers capable of controlling elemental spirits.&lt;ref name="Scott1994"&gt;{{cite book|author=William Henry Scott  | authorlink = William Henry Scott (historian)   | url = https://archive.org/details/BarangaySixteenthCenturyPhilippineCultureAndSociety | title = Barangay: Sixteenth Century Philippine Culture and Society  | publisher = Ateneo de Manila University Press  | date = 1994  | location = Quezon City  | isbn = 9715501354 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hislop"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Stephen K.

Shamanistic practices in the Philippines were largely abandoned when the islands were converted to Christianity and Islam. Though there are still traces of it among modern folk healers and in isolated tribes.&lt;ref name="Scott1994"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hislop"/&gt;

====Siberia and North Asia====

[[File:Chuonnasuan, the last shaman of the Oroqen, in July 1994 (Photo by Richard Noll).jpg|thumb|[[Oroqen people|Oroqen]] shaman, northern [[China]]]]

[[Siberia]] is regarded as the ''[[locus classicus]]'' of shamanism.&lt;ref name=locclass&gt;Hoppál 2005: 13&lt;/ref&gt; The area is inhabited by many different ethnic groups, and many of its peoples observe shamanistic practices, even in modern times. Many classical ethnographic sources of "shamanism" were recorded among Siberian peoples.

[[Manchu people|Manchu]] Shamanism is one of very few Shamanist traditions which held official status into the modern era, by becoming one of the imperial cults of the [[Qing dynasty]] of [[China]] (alongside [[Buddhism]], [[Taoism]] and traditional [[Heaven worship]]). The [[Palace of Earthly Tranquility]], one of the principal halls of the [[Forbidden City]] in [[Beijing]], was partly dedicated to Shamanistic rituals. The ritual set-up is still preserved ''in situ'' today.

Among the Siberian [[Chukchis]] peoples, a shaman is interpreted as someone who is [[Spirit possession|possessed]] by a spirit, who demands that someone assume the shamanic role for their people. Among the Buryat, there is a ritual known as ''shanar''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://texts.00.gs/Shanar.htm|title=S^anar [Buryat]|publisher=|accessdate=6 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereby a candidate is consecrated as shaman by another, already-established shaman.

Among several [[Samoyedic peoples]], shamanism was a living tradition also in modern times, especially at groups living in isolation, until recent times ([[Nganasan people|Nganasan]]s).&lt;ref name=ngan&gt;Hoppál 2005: 92–93&lt;/ref&gt; The last notable Nganasan shaman's seances could be recorded on film in the 1970s.&lt;ref name="Hoppal" /&gt;&lt;ref name=ngan/&gt;

When the People's Republic of China was formed in 1949 and the border with Russian Siberia was formally sealed, many nomadic Tungus groups (including the Evenki) that practiced shamanism were confined in Manchuria and Inner Mongolia. The last shaman of the Oroqen, Chuonnasuan (Meng Jinfu), died in October 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Noll|first1=Richard|title=The Last Shaman of the Orqen of Northeast China|url=https://www.academia.edu/8520174/The_last_shaman_of_the_Oroqen_people_of_Northeast_China._Shaman_Journal_of_the_International_Society_for_Shamanistic_Research_2009_17_1_and_2_117-140|website=Academia.edu|publisher=Shaman 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many other cases, shamanism was in decline even at the beginning of the 20th century, for instance, among the [[Romani people|Roma]].&lt;ref name="Hoppal_a" /&gt;

====Central Asia====

=====Geographic influences on Central Asian shamanism=====
Geographical factors heavily influence the character and development of the religion, myths, rituals and epics of Central Asia. While in other parts of the world, religious rituals are primarily used to promote agricultural prosperity, here they were used to ensure success in hunting and breeding livestock.  Animals are one of the most important elements of indigenous religion in Central Asia because of the role they play in the survival of the nomadic civilizations of the steppes as well as sedentary populations living on land not conducive to agriculture.  Shamans wore animal skins and feathers and underwent transformations into animals during spiritual journeys. In addition, animals served as humans' guides, rescuers, ancestors, totems and sacrificial victims.&lt;ref&gt;Julian Baldick, ''Animal and Shaman: Ancient Religions of Central Asia'' (New York: University Press, 2000), 3–35&lt;/ref&gt;  As a religion of nature, shamanism throughout Central Asia held particular reverence for the relations between sky, earth and water and believed in the mystical importance of trees and mountains.  Shamanism in Central Asia also places a strong emphasis on the opposition between summer and winter, corresponding to the huge differences in temperature common in the region. The harsh conditions and poverty caused by the extreme temperatures drove Central Asian nomads throughout history to pursue militaristic goals against their sedentary neighbors. This military background can be seen in the reverence for horses and warriors within many indigenous religions.&lt;ref&gt;Marjorie Mandelstam Balzer, ''Shamanism: Soviet Studies of Traditional Religion in Siberia and Central Asia'' (New York: M.E. Sharpe, 1990), 113&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Common shamanic practices and beliefs shared among Central Asians=====
Central Asian shamans served as sacred intermediaries between the human and spirit world. In this role they took on tasks such as healing, divination, appealing to ancestors, manipulating the elements, leading lost souls and officiating public religious rituals.  The shamanic séance served as a public display of the shaman's journey to the spirit world and usually involved intense trances, drumming, dancing, chanting, elaborate costumes, miraculous displays of physical strength, and audience involvement. The goal of these séances ranged from recovering the lost soul of a sick patient and divining the future to controlling the weather and finding a lost person or thing. The use of sleight-of-hand tricks, ventriloquism, and hypnosis were common in these rituals but did not explain the more impressive feats and actual cures accomplished by shamans.&lt;ref&gt;Nora K. Chadwick, "Shamanism among the Tatars of Central Asia," ''The Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland'', Vol. 66, (Jan–Jun 1936): 97–99&lt;/ref&gt;

Shamans perform in a "state of ecstasy" deliberately induced by an effort of will. Reaching this altered state of consciousness required great mental exertion, concentration and strict self-discipline. Mental and physical preparation included long periods of silent meditation, fasting, and smoking. In this state, skilled shamans employ capabilities that the human organism cannot accomplish in the ordinary state. Shamans in ecstasy displayed unusual physical strength, the ability to withstand extreme temperatures, the bearing of stabbing and cutting without pain, and the heightened receptivity of the sense organs. Shamans made use of intoxicating substances and hallucinogens, especially mukhomor mushrooms and alcohol, as a means of hastening the attainment of ecstasy.&lt;ref&gt;Balzer, ''Shamanism'', 12–21&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of purification by fire is an important element of the shamanic tradition dating back as early as the 6th century. People and things connected with the dead had to be purified by passing between fires.  These purifications were complex exorcisms while others simply involved the act of literally walking between two fires while being blessed by the shaman. Shamans in literature and practice were also responsible for using special stones to manipulate weather. Rituals are performed with these stones to attract rain or repel snow, cold or wind. This "rain-stone" was used for many occasions including bringing an end to drought as well as producing hailstorms as a means of warfare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Andrew Boyle | first1 = John | year = 1972 | title = Turkish and Mongol Shamanism in the Middle Ages | url = | journal = Folklore | volume = 83 | issue = | pages = 183–185 | doi=10.1080/0015587x.1972.9716468}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Despite distinctions between various types of shamans and specific traditions, there is a uniformity throughout the region manifested in the personal beliefs, objectives, rituals, symbols and the appearance of shamans.

=====Shamanic rituals as artistic performance=====
The shamanic ceremony is both a religious ceremony and an artistic performance. The fundamental purpose of the dramatic displays seen during shamanic ceremonies is not to draw attention or to create a spectacle for the audience as many Westerners have come to believe, but to lead the tribe in a solemn ritualistic process.

In general, all performances consist of four elements: dance, music, poetry and dramatic or mimetic action. The use of these elements serves the purpose of outwardly expressing his mystical communion with nature and the spirits for the rest of the tribe. The true shaman can make the journey to the spirit world at any time and any place, but shamanic ceremonies provide a way for the rest of the tribe to share in this religious experience. The shaman changes his voice mimetically to represent different persons, gods, and animals while his music and dance change to show his progress in the spirit world and his different spiritual interactions. Many shamans practice ventriloquism and make use of their ability to accurately imitate the sounds of animals, nature, humans and other noises in order to provide the audience with the ambiance of the journey. Elaborate dances and recitations of songs and poetry are used to make the shamans spiritual adventures into a matter of living reality to his audience.&lt;ref&gt;Chadwick, ''Shamanism among the Tatars of Central Asia'': 93–101&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Costume and accessories=====
The shaman's attire varies throughout the region but his chief accessories are his coat, cap, and tambourine or drum. The transformation into an animal is an important aspect of the journey into the spirit world undertaken during shamanic rituals so the coat is often decorated with birds feathers and representations of animals, coloured handkerchiefs, bells and metal ornaments. The cap is usually made from the skin of a bird with the feathers and sometimes head, still attached.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BRyCAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA43&amp;lpg=PA43&amp;dq=Costume+and+accessories+of+central+asian+shamanism&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=EoDH2Aw3ZR&amp;sig=GS2s5_Y4ZZ26GVhaooATrCrMfdM&amp;hl=fr&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjJm4y_5YrUAhXF7RQKHfHtCJEQ6AEIQjAE#v=onepage&amp;q=Costume%20and%20accessories%20of%20central%20asian%20shamanism&amp;f=false|title=The Archaeology of Shamanism|last=Price|first=Neil|date=2003-12-16|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781134527694|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The drum or tambourine is the essential means of communicating with spirits and enabling the shaman to reach altered states of consciousness on his journey. The drum, representing the universe in epitome, is often divided into equal halves to represent the earth and lower realms. Symbols and natural objects are added to the drum representing natural forces and heavenly bodies.&lt;ref&gt;Chadwick, ''Shamanism among the Tatars of Central Asia'': 85–87&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Shamanism in Tsarist and Soviet Russia=====
In Soviet Central Asia, the Soviet government persecuted and denounced shamans as practitioners of fraudulent medicine and perpetuators of outdated religious beliefs in the new age of science and logic. The radical transformations occurring after the October Socialist Revolution led to a sharp decrease in the activity of shamans. Shamans represented an important component in the traditional culture of Central Asians and because of their important role in society, Soviet organizations and campaigns targeted shamans in their attempt to eradicate traditional influences in the lives of the indigenous peoples. Along with persecution under the tsarist and Soviet regimes, the spread of Christianity and Islam had a role in the disintegration of native faith throughout central Asia. Poverty, political instability and foreign influence are also detrimental to a religion that requires publicity and patronage to flourish.
By the 1980s most shamans were discredited in the eyes of their people by Soviet officials and physicians.&lt;ref&gt;Balzer, ''Shamanism'', 42–49&lt;/ref&gt;

====Other Asian traditions====
{{Further|Wu (shaman)}}

"[[Jhakri]]" is the common name used for shamans in [[Sikkim]], [[India]] and [[Nepal]]. They exist in the [[Limbu]], [[Sunuwar]], [[Rai people|Rai]], [[Sherpa people|Sherpa]], [[Kami]], [[Tamang]], [[Gurung]] and [[Lepcha people|Lepcha]] communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb |Gulia |2005 | |pp=153–54 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They are inflluenced by [[Hinduism]], Tibetan Buddhism, [[Mun (religion)|Mun]] and Bön rites.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb |Gulia |2005 | |p=168 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shamanism is still widely practiced in the [[Ryukyu Islands]] ([[Okinawa]], [[Japan]]), where shamans are known as 'Noro' (all women) and 'Yuta'.  'Noro' generally administer public or communal ceremonies while 'Yuta' focus on civil and private matters. Shamanism is also practiced in a few rural areas in Japan proper. It is commonly believed that the [[Shinto]] religion is the result of the transformation of a shamanistic tradition into a religion.
Forms of practice vary somewhat in the several Ryukyu islands, so that there is, for example, a distinct '''Miyako''' shamanism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://texts.00.gs/Miyako_Shamanism.htm|title=Miyako shamanism|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shamanism practices seem to have been preserved in the Catholic religious traditions of aborigines in [[Taiwan]].&lt;ref&gt;O. Lardenois,  [http://www.erenlai.com/media/downloads/TheologicalShamanismLardenois.pdf Shamanism and Catholic Indigenous Communities in Taiwan]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Vietnam]], shamans conduct rituals in many of the religious traditions that co-mingle in the majority and minority populations. In their rituals, music, dance, special garments and offerings are part of the performance that surround the spirit journey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amnh.org/exhibitions/vietnam/07_other/|title=Journeys to Other Worlds: The Rites of Shamans|last=|first=|publisher=[[American Museum of Natural History]]|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080602010747/http://www.amnh.org/exhibitions/vietnam/07_other/|archivedate=2008-06-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the prehistoric peoples who once lived in Siberia have dispersed and migrated into other regions, bringing aspects of their cultures with them. For example, many Uralic peoples live now outside Siberia, however the original location of the [[Proto-Uralic language|Proto-Uralic]] peoples (and its extent) is debated. Combined [[Phytogeography|phytogeographical]] and linguistic considerations (distribution of various tree species and the presence of their names in various Uralic languages) suggest that this area was north of Central [[Ural Mountains]] and on lower and middle parts of [[Ob River]].&lt;ref name=ancloc&gt;Hajdú 1975: 35&lt;/ref&gt; The ancestors of [[Hungarian people]] or Magyars have wandered from their ancestral proto-Uralic area to the [[Pannonian Basin]]. Shamanism has played an important role in [[Altaic mythologies|Turko-Mongol mythology]]: [[Tengriism]] - the major ancient belief among [[Xiongnu]], Mongol and [[Turkic peoples]], [[Magyars]] and [[Bulgars]] - incorporates elements of shamanism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| title = Turkish and Mongolian Shamanism| editor-last = Bonnefoy| editor-first = Yves| year = 1993| encyclopedia = Asian Mythologies| publisher = University of Chicago Press| location = Chicago| pages = 329–331| isbn = 0-226-06456-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shamanism is no more a living practice among Hungarians, but remnants have been reserved as fragments of folklore, in folktales, customs.&lt;ref&gt;Diószegi 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

Some historians of the Late Middle Ages and Early Modern period have argued that traces of shamanistic traditions can be seen in the popular folk belief of this period. Most prominent among these was the Italian [[Carlo Ginzburg]], who claimed shamanistic elements in the ''[[benandanti]]'' custom of 16th century Italy,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Gin83|Ginzburg 1983 [1966]]].&lt;/ref&gt; the Hungarian [[Éva Pócs]], who identified them in the ''[[táltos]]'' tradition of Hungary,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Poc99|Pócs 1999]].&lt;/ref&gt; and the Frenchman [[Claude Lecouteux]], who has argued that Medieval traditions regarding the soul are based on earlier shamanic ideas.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lec03|Lecouteux 2003]].&lt;/ref&gt; Ginzburg in particular has argued that some of these traditions influenced the conception of [[witchcraft]] in Christendom, in particular ideas regarding the [[witches' sabbath]], leading to the events of the [[witch trials in the Early Modern period]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Gin90|Ginzburg 1990]].&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these Italian traditions survived into the 20th and early 21st centuries, allowing Italian-American sociologist Sabina Magliocco to make a brief study of them (2009).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/171083/Italain_Cunning_Craft_Some_Preliminary_Observations|title=Italian Cunning Craft: Some Preliminary Observations|author=Sabina Magliocco|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Circumpolar shamanism===

====Inuit and Yupik cultures====
[[File:Yupik shaman Nushagak.jpg|thumb|[[Central Alaskan Yup'ik|Yup'ik]] shaman [[exorcising]] evil spirits from a sick boy, [[Nushagak, Alaska]], 1890s.&lt;ref&gt;Fienup-Riordan, Ann. 1994: 206&lt;/ref&gt;]]
{{Main|Shamanism among Eskimo peoples}}
[[Eskimo]] groups inhabit a huge area stretching from [[Eastern Siberia]] through Alaska and Northern Canada (including [[Labrador Peninsula]]) to [[Greenland]]. Shamanistic practice and beliefs have been recorded at several parts of this vast area crosscutting continental borders.&lt;ref name=Mer-BecHalfHid&gt;Merkur 1985&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Gab-KarEszk/&gt;&lt;ref name=KleiSon-Esk&gt;Kleivan &amp; Sonne 1985&lt;/ref&gt;
{{IPA notice}}

When speaking of "shamanism" in various Eskimo groups, we must remember that (as mentioned above) the term "shamanism" can cover certain characteristics of ''various'' different cultures.&lt;ref name="cogmap"/&gt; [[#Mediator|Mediation]] is regarded often as an important aspect of shamanism in general.&lt;ref name=med&gt;Hoppál 2005: 45–50&lt;/ref&gt; Also in most Eskimo groups, the role of mediator is known well:&lt;ref name=menmed&gt;Menovščikov 1996: 442&lt;/ref&gt; the person filling it in is actually believed to be able to contact the beings who populate the belief system. Term "shaman" is used in several English-language publications also in relation to Eskimos.&lt;ref name="Mer-BecHalfHid"/&gt;&lt;ref name=KleiSon-Esk/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vitebsky 1996&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Freuchen 1961: 32&lt;/ref&gt; Also the ''alignalghi'' ({{IPA-iu|aˈliɣnalʁi|IPA}}) of the Asian Eskimos is translated as "shaman" in the Russian&lt;ref&gt;Рубцова 1954: 203, 209&lt;/ref&gt; and English&lt;ref name=menmed/&gt; literature.

The belief system assumes specific links between the living people, the souls of hunted animals, and those of dead people.&lt;ref&gt;Both death of a person and successfully hunted game require that cutting, sewing etc. be tabooed, so that the invisible soul does not get hurt accidentally (Kleivan &amp; Sonne, pp. 18–21). In Greenland, the transgression of death tabu could turn the soul of the dead into a ''tupilak'', a restless ghost which scared game away (Kleivan &amp; Sonne 1985, p. 23). Animals fled from hunter in case of taboo breaches, e.g. birth taboo, death taboo (Kleivan &amp; Sonne, pp. 12–13)&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Soul (spirit)|soul]] concepts of several groups are specific examples of [[soul dualism]] (showing variability in details in the various cultures).

Unlike the majority of shamanisms the careers of most Eskimo shamans lack the motivation of ''force'': becoming a shaman is usually a result of deliberate consideration, not a necessity forced by the spirits.&lt;ref name="failed-shaman"/&gt;

====Diversity, with similarities====
Another possible concern: do the belief systems of various Eskimo groups have such common features at all, that would justify any mentioning them together? There was no political structure above the groups, their languages were relative, but differed more or less, often forming [[language continuum]]s.&lt;ref name=complink&gt;[http://www.uaf.edu/anlc/yupik_inuit.html Lawrence Kaplan: Comparative Yupik and Inuit] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080306132554/http://www.uaf.edu/anlc/yupik_inuit.html |date=2008-03-06 }} (found on the site of [http://www.uaf.edu/anlc/index.html Alaska Native Language Center] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090123172349/http://www.uaf.edu/anlc/index.html |date=2009-01-23 }})&lt;/ref&gt;

There are similarities in the cultures of the Eskimo groups&lt;ref&gt;Kleivan 1985: 8&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rasmussen 1965: 366 (ch. XXIII)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rasmussen 1965: 166 (ch. XIII)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=padlgreen&gt;Rasmussen 1965: 110 (ch. VIII)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Mau-Mor&gt;Mauss 1979&lt;/ref&gt; together with diversity, far from homogeneity.&lt;ref&gt;Kleivan 1985: 26&lt;/ref&gt;

The Russian linguist Menovshikov (Меновщиков), an expert of [[Siberian Yupik language|Siberian Yupik]] and [[Sireniki Eskimo language]]s (while admitting that he is not a specialist in ethnology)&lt;ref&gt;Menovščikov 1996 [1968]: 433&lt;/ref&gt; mentions, that the shamanistic seances of those [[Siberian Yupik]] and [[Sirenik Eskimos|Sireniki]] groups he has seen have many similarities to those of Greenland Inuit groups described by [[Fridtjof Nansen]],&lt;ref&gt;Menovščikov 1996 [1968]: 442&lt;/ref&gt; although a large distance separates Siberia and Greenland. There may be certain similarities also in Asiatic groups with North American ones.&lt;ref&gt;Vitebsky 1996: 42 (ch. ''North America'')&lt;/ref&gt; Also the usage of a specific shaman's language is documented among several Eskimo groups, used mostly for talking to spirits.&lt;ref&gt;Merkur 1985:7&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kleivan &amp; Sonne 1985: 14&lt;/ref&gt; Also the Ungazighmiit (belonging to [[Siberian Yupik]]s) had a special [[Allegory|allegoric]] usage of some expressions.&lt;ref&gt;Rubcova 1954: 128&lt;/ref&gt;

The local cultures showed great diversity. The myths concerning the role of shaman had several variants, and also the name of their protagonists varied from culture to culture. For example, a mythological figure, usually referred to in the literature by the collective term [[Sedna (mythology)|Sea Woman]], has factually many local names: Nerrivik "meat dish" among Polar Inuit, Nuliayuk "lubricous" among [[Netsilingmiut]], Sedna "the nether one" among Baffin Land Inuit.&lt;ref&gt;Kleivan &amp; Sonne 1985: 27&lt;/ref&gt;  Also the soul conceptions, e.g. the details of the [[soul dualism]] showed great variability, ranging from guardianship to a kind of [[reincarnation]].  Conceptions of spirits or other beings had also many variants (see e.g. the [[tupilaq]] concept).&lt;ref&gt;Kleivan &amp; Sonne 1985: 30–31&lt;/ref&gt;

===Americas===

====North America====

[[File:White indian conjuror.jpg|thumb|[[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] "conjuror" in a 1590 colonial engraving]]
[[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] and [[First Nations]] cultures have diverse religious beliefs and there was never one universal Native American religion or spiritual system. Although many Native American cultures have traditional healers, ritualists, singers, [[Mysticism|mystics]], lore-keepers and [[Medicine man|Medicine people]], none of them ever used, or use, the term "shaman" to describe these religious leaders. Rather, like other indigenous cultures the world over, their spiritual functionaries are described by words in their own languages, and in many cases are not taught to outsiders.

Many of these indigenous religions have been grossly misrepresented by outside observers and anthropologists, even to the extent of superficial or seriously mistaken anthropological accounts being taken as more authentic than the accounts of actual members of the cultures and religions in question. Often these accounts suffer from "[[Noble savage|Noble Savage]]"-type romanticism and [[racism]]. Some contribute to the fallacy that Native American cultures and religions are something that only existed in the past, and which can be mined for data despite the opinions of Native communities.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Peter N. 2008 Shamans and Shamanism: A Comprehensive Bibliography of the Terms Use in North America. Boulder, Colorado: Bauu Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Not all Indigenous communities have roles for specific individuals who mediate with the spirit world on behalf of the community. Among those that do have this sort of religious structure, spiritual methods and beliefs may have some commonalities, though many of these commonalities are due to some nations being closely related, from the same region, or through post-Colonial governmental policies leading to the combining of formerly independent nations on reservations. This can sometimes lead to the impression that there is more unity among belief systems than there was in antiquity.

With the arrival of European settlers and colonial administration, the practice of Native American traditional beliefs was discouraged and Christianity was imposed&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Beneath the Underdog: Race, Religion, and the Trail of Tears|url=http://www.us-data.org/us/minges/underdog.html|quote=The missionaries, and especially those of the American Board, established a basic position of neutrality "between two fires" and as the Bible did not explicitly condemn slavery, they accepted "all to our communion who give evidence that they love the Lord Jesus Christ."}}&lt;/ref&gt;  upon the indigenous people. In most communities, the traditions were not completely eradicated, but rather went underground, and were practiced secretly until the prohibitive laws were repealed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Resistance and Renewal: Surviving the Indian Residential School|page=104|author=Celia Haig-Brown|quote=we were all talking Shuswap.&amp;nbsp;... She said to us, 'You're never to get caught talking your language&amp;nbsp;... You'll get whipped;you'll really get punished'&amp;nbsp;... So we were careful after that not to be caught speaking.&amp;nbsp;... When we were way out there, we'd talk together in our language.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Up until and during the last hundred years, thousands of Native American and [[First Nations]] children from many different communities were sent into the [[Canadian Indian residential school system]], and [[Indian boarding school]]s in an effort to destroy tribal languages, cultures and beliefs. The [[Trail of Tears]], in the US, forced Native Americans to relocate from their traditional homes. Canadian laws enacted in 1982, and henceforth, have attempted to reverse previous attempts at extinguishing Native culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Christian Aboriginal Infrastructure Developments|url=http://caid.ca/assimilation_policy.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Peruvian [[Amazon basin]] and north coastal regions of the country, the healers are known as [[curandero]]s. ''Ayahuasqueros'' are Peruvians who specialize in the use of [[ayahuasca]].&lt;ref name="upf.com"/&gt; ''Ayahuasqueros'' have become popular among Western spiritual seekers, who claim that the ''ayauasqueros'' and their ayahuasca brews have cured them of everything from depression to addiction to cancer.&lt;ref name="Peru" /&gt;

In addition to ''curanderos'' use of ayahuasca and their ritualized ingestion of [[mescaline]]-bearing [[San Pedro cactus]]es (''Trichocereus pachanoi'') for the [[divination]] and diagnosis of [[Maleficium (sorcery)|sorcery]], north-coastal shamans are famous throughout the region for their intricately complex and symbolically dense healing [[altar]]s called mesas (tables).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis|type=PhD|last1=VanWagenen|first1=Bradford Carr|title=The shaman's mesa: a model of individuation|date=20 May 2011|publisher=Pacifica Graduate Institute|quote=Some of these mesas, like those of the [[Q'ero]] shamans, contain a dozen sacred objects; others, typical of the north-coastal shamans of Peru, contain over one hundred objects.}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Douglas Sharon|Sharon]] (1993) has argued that the mesas symbolize the dualistic ideology underpinning the practice and experience of north-coastal shamanism.&lt;ref&gt;Joralemen, D. and [[Douglas Sharon|D. Sharon]] 1993 Sorcery and Shamanism: Curanderos and Clients in Northern Peru. Salt Lake City: University of Utah Press.&lt;/ref&gt; For Sharon, the mesas are the, "physical embodiment of the supernatural opposition between benevolent and malevolent energies" (Dean 1998: 61).&lt;ref&gt;Dean, Bartholomew 1998 "Review of Sorcery and Shamanism: Curanderos and Clients in Northern Peru" American Ethnologist. 25(1): 61–62.&lt;/ref&gt;

In several tribes living in the [[Amazon rainforest]], the spiritual leaders also act as managers of scarce ecological resources&lt;ref name=eco/&gt;&lt;ref name=ecopia&gt;Boglár 2001: 26&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=coop/&gt; The rich symbolism in [[Tukano people|Tukano]] culture has been documented in [[field work]]s&lt;ref name="eco"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hug-FrMilkRiv&gt;Christine Hugh-Jones 1980&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Hug-PalmPlei&gt;Stephen Hugh-Jones 1980&lt;/ref&gt; even in the last decades of the 20th century.

The ''yaskomo'' of the [[Wai-Wai people|Waiwai]] is believed to be able to perform a [[soul travel|soul flight]]. The soul flight can serve several functions:
* healing
* flying to the sky to consult cosmological beings (the moon or the brother of the moon) to get a name for a newborn baby
* flying to the cave of ''peccaries' mountains'' to ask the ''father of peccaries''  for abundance of game
* flying deep down in a river, to achieve the help of other beings.
Thus, a yaskomo is believed to be able to reach sky, earth, and water.&lt;ref name="yaskomo soul flight"&gt;Fock 1963: 16&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Mapuche=====
Among the [[Mapuche]] people of [[Chile]], ''[[Machi (Shaman)|Machi]]'' is usually a woman who serves the community by performing ceremonies to cure diseases, ward off evil, influence the weather and harvest, and by practicing other forms of healing such as herbalism.

=====Aymara=====
For the [[Aymara people|Aymara]] people of South America the [[Yatiri]] is a healer who heals the body and the soul, they serve the community and do the rituals for [[Pachamama]].

Part of the healing power attributed to shamanic practices depends of the use of plant alkaloids taken during the therapeutic sessions [[(Trance and Shamanic Cure on the South American Continent: Psychopharmalogical and Neurobiological Interpretations, Anthropology of Consciousness, Vol.21, Issue 1, pp. 83-105, ISSN 1053-4202, 2010)]].

=====Fuegians=====
{{IPA notice}}
Although [[Fuegians]] (the indigenous peoples of [[Tierra del Fuego]]) were all [[hunter-gatherer]]s,&lt;ref&gt;Gusinde 1966, pp. 6–7&lt;/ref&gt;  they did not share a common culture. The material culture was not homogenous, either: the big island and the archipelago made two different adaptations possible. Some of the cultures were coast-dwelling, others were land-oriented.&lt;ref name=Ser-Hun&gt;Service, Elman: The Hunter.

Both [[Selk'nam]] and [[Yámana]] had persons filling in shaman-like roles.

On the island of [[Papua New Guinea]], indigenous tribes believe that illness and calamity are caused by dark spirits, or ''masalai'', which cling to a person's body and [[poison]] them. Shamans are summoned in order to purge the unwholesome spirits from a person.&lt;ref name=FourCorners_Amazon_entry&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Four-Corners-Journey-Heart-Guinea/dp/0792274172/ref=pd_bxgy_b_img_b |title=Amazon.com listing for the "Four Corners: A Journey into the Heart of Papua New Guinea" }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=FourCornersWeb&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kirasalak.com/FourCorners.html |title=Kira Salak's official webpage on "Four Corners" |last=Salak |first=Kira }}&lt;/ref&gt; Shamans also perform [[rainmaking]] ceremonies and can allegedly improve a hunter's ability to catch animals.&lt;ref name=MakingRain&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kirasalak.com/MakingRain.html |title=MAKING RAIN—from Four Corners |last=Salak |first=Kira }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Australia various aboriginal groups refer to their shamans as "clever men" and "clever women" also as ''kadji''. These aboriginal shamans use ''[[maban]]'' or ''mabain'', the material that is believed to give them their purported magical powers. Besides healing, contact with spiritual beings, involvement in initiation and other secret ceremonies, they are also enforcers of tribal laws, keepers of special knowledge and may "[[Curse|hex]]" to death one who breaks a social taboo by singing a song only known to the "clever men".

===Africa===

[[File:Sangoma performing a Baptism.jpg|thumb|[[Traditional Healers of South Africa|Sangoma/Inyanga]] performing a traditional baptism on a baby in order to protect the spirit of the baby, Johannesburg, South Africa]]

In [[Mali]], [[Dogon people|Dogon]] sorcerers (both male and female) communicate with a spirit named Amma, who advises them on healing and divination practices.

The classical meaning of shaman as a person who, after recovering from a mental illness (or insanity) takes up the professional calling of socially recognized religious practitioner, is exemplified among the [[Sisala]] (of northern Gold Coast) : "the fairies "seized" him and made him insane for several months. Eventually, though, he learned to control their power, which he now uses to divine."&lt;ref&gt;Eugene L. Mendonsa : ''The Politics of Divination : a Processual View of Reactions to Illness and Deviance among the Sisala''. University of California Press, Berkeley, 1982. p. 112&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''[[sangoma]]'', as employed in [[Zulu people|Zulu]] and congeneric languages, is effectively equivalent to shaman. Sangomas are highly revered and respected in their society, where illness is thought to be caused by [[witchcraft]],&lt;ref&gt;David M Cumes "Africa in my bones" p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; pollution (contact with impure objects or occurrences), bad spirits, or the ancestors themselves,&lt;ref&gt;Susan Schuster Campbell "Called to Heal" p. 38&lt;/ref&gt; either malevolently, or through neglect if they are not respected, or to show an individual her calling to become a sangoma (''thwasa'').&lt;ref&gt;Susan Schuster Campbell "Called to Heal" p. 79&lt;/ref&gt; For harmony between the living and the dead, vital for a trouble-free life, the ancestors must be shown respect through ritual and animal sacrifice.&lt;ref&gt;David M Cumes "Africa in my bones" p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''[[inyanga]]'' also employed by the [[Nguni people|Nguni]] cultures is equivalent to 'herbalist' as used by the Zulu people and a variation used by the [[Shona people|Karanga]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://texts.00.gs/Karanga_shamanism.htm|title=Karanga mythology [Zimbabwe]|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; among whom remedies (locally known as [[muti]]) for ailments are discovered by the inyanga being informed in a dream, of the herb able to effect the cure and also of where that herb is to be found. The majority of the herbal knowledge base is passed down from one ''inyanga'' to the next, often within a particular family circle in any one village.

Shamanism is known among the Nuba of Kordofan in Sudan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Nadel | first1 = S.F. | year = 1941 | title = A Shaman Cult in the Nuba Mountains | url = | journal = Sudan Notes and Records | volume = 24 | issue = 1| pages = 85–112 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Nadel | first1 = S.F. | year = 1946 | title = A Study of Shamanism in the Nuba Mountains | url = | journal = Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute | volume = 76 | issue = | pages = 25–37 | doi=10.2307/2844307}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contemporary Western shamanism===
{{Main|Neoshamanism}}
There is an endeavor in some contemporary [[occultism|occult]] and [[esotericism|esoteric]] circles to reinvent shamanism in a modern form, often drawing from [[core shamanism]]—a set of beliefs and practices synthesized by [[Michael Harner]]—centered on the use of ritual drumming and dance, and Harner's interpretations of various indigenous religions. Harner has faced criticism for taking pieces of diverse religions out of their cultural contexts and synthesising a set of universal shamanic techniques. Some neoshamans focus on the ritual use of [[entheogens]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Hanegraaff | first = Wouter J. | chapter = Entheogenic Esotericism | editor-last1  = Asprem | editor-first1 = Egil | editor-last2  = Granholm | editor-first2 = Kennet | title  = Contemporary Esotericism | publisher = Routledge | place = London | publication-date = 2014 | isbn = 978-1-908049-32-2 | quote = ...what is now known as neoshamanism emerged during the 1960s as a movement dominatedby enthusiasm for natural psychoactives...}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also embrace the philosophies of [[chaos magic]]{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}} while others (such as [[Jan Fries]])&lt;ref&gt;Visual Magic:A Manual of Freestyle Shamanism:Jan Fries {{ISBN|1-869928-57-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; have created their own forms of shamanism.

European-based neoshamanic traditions are focused upon the researched or imagined traditions of ancient Europe, where many [[mystical]] practices and belief systems were suppressed by the Christian church. Some of these practitioners express a desire to practice a system that is based upon their own ancestral traditions. Some anthropologists and practitioners have discussed the impact of such neoshamanism as "giving extra pay" (Harvey, 1997 and elsewhere) to indigenous American traditions, particularly as many pagan or heathen shamanic practitioners do not call themselves shamans, but instead use specific names derived from the European traditions—they work within such as ''[[völva]]'' or ''seidkona'' ([[seiðr|seid-woman]]) of the [[sagas]] (see Blain 2002, Wallis 2003).

Many spiritual seekers travel to Peru to work with ''ayahuasqueros'', shamans who engage in the ritual use of [[ayahuasca]], a psychedelic tea which has been documented to cure everything from depression to addiction. When taking ayahuasca, participants frequently report meeting spirits, and receiving divine revelations.&lt;ref name="Peru" /&gt; Shamanistic techniques have also been used in New Age therapies which use enactment and association with other realities as an intervention.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ull.es/congresos/conmirel/YORK.html ULL – Universidad de La Laguna] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120120013711/http://www.ull.es/congresos/conmirel/YORK.html |date=2012-01-20 }} {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nlpuniversitypress.com/html/CaCom08.html|title=Ca-Com|publisher=|accessdate=6 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism of the term==
{{Further|medicine man}}
[[File:Shaman tableau.png|thumb|A tableau presenting figures of various cultures filling in mediator-like roles, often being termed as "shaman" in the literature. The tableau presents the diversity of this concept.]]
The anthropologist [[Alice Kehoe]] criticizes the term "shaman" in her book ''Shamans and Religion: An Anthropological Exploration in Critical Thinking''. Part of this criticism involves the notion of [[cultural appropriation]].&lt;ref name="Waveland Press"/&gt; This includes criticism of [[New Age]] and modern Western forms of shamanism, which, according to Kehoe, misrepresent or dilute indigenous practices.  Alice Kehoe also believes that the term reinforces racist ideas such as the [[Noble Savage]].

Kehoe is highly critical of [[Mircea Eliade]]'s work on shamanism as an invention synthesized from various sources unsupported by more direct research. To Kehoe, citing that ritualistic practices (most notably drumming, trance, chanting, entheogens and hallucinogens, spirit communication and healing) as being definitive of shamanism is poor practice. Such citations ignore the fact that those practices exist outside of what is defined as shamanism and play similar roles even in non-shamanic cultures (such as the role of chanting in [[Judeo-Christian]] and Islamic rituals) and that in their expression are unique to each culture that uses them. Such practices cannot be generalized easily, accurately, or usefully into a global religion of shamanism. Because of this, Kehoe is also highly critical of the hypothesis that shamanism is an ancient, unchanged, and surviving religion from the [[Paleolithic]] period.&lt;ref name="Waveland Press"/&gt;

Anthropologist [[Mihály Hoppál]] also discusses whether the term "shamanism" is appropriate. He notes that for many readers, "-ism" implies a particular dogma, like Buddhism or Judaism. He recommends using the term "shamanhood"&lt;ref name=summer/&gt; or "shamanship"&lt;ref&gt;Hoppál &amp; Szathmári &amp; Takács 2006: 14&lt;/ref&gt; (a term used in old Russian and German [[ethnography|ethnographic]] reports at the beginning of the 20th century) for stressing the diversity and the specific features of the discussed cultures. He believes that this places more stress on the local variations&lt;ref name="cogmap" /&gt; and emphasizes that shamanism is not a religion of sacred [[dogma]]s, but linked to the everyday life in a practical way.&lt;ref&gt;Hoppál 1998: 40&lt;/ref&gt; Following similar thoughts, he also conjectures a contemporary paradigm shift.&lt;ref name=summer&gt;[http://www.folkscene.hu/magzines/shaman/coming.html ISSR, 2001 Summer], abstract online in 2nd half of 2nd paragraph&lt;/ref&gt; [[Piers Vitebsky]] also mentions that, despite really astonishing similarities, there is no unity in shamanism. The various, fragmented shamanistic practices and beliefs coexist with other beliefs everywhere. There is no record of pure shamanistic societies (although, as for the past, their existence is not impossible).&lt;ref&gt;Vitebsky 1996: 11&lt;/ref&gt; Norwegian social anthropologist Hakan Rydving has likewise argued for the abandonment of the terms "shaman" and "shamanism" as "scientific illusions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rydving|first1=Hakan|title=Le chamanisme aujourd'hui: constructions et deconstructions d'une illusion scientifique|journal=Etudes mongoles et siberiennes, centrasiatiques et tibetaines|date=2011|volume=42|doi=10.4000/emscat.1815}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dulam Bumochir has affirmed the above critiques of "shamanism" as a Western construct created for comparative purposes and, in an extensive article, has documented the role of Mongols themselves, particularly "the partnership of scholars and shamans in the reconstruction of shamanism" in post-1990/post-communist Mongolia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bumochir|first1=Dulam|title=Institutionalization of Mongolian shamanism: from primitivism to civilization|journal=Asian Ethnicity|date=2014|volume=15|issue=4|pages=473–491}}&lt;/ref&gt; This process has also been documented by Swiss anthropologist Judith Hangartner in her landmark study of Darhad shamans in Mongolia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hangartner|first1=Judith|title=The Constitution and Contestation of Darhad Shamans' Power in  Contemporary Mongolia|date=2011|publisher=Global Oriental|location=Leiden|isbn=9781906876111}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historian Karena Kollmar-Polenz argues that the social construction and reification of shamanism as a religious "other" actually began with the 18th century writings of Tibetan Buddhist monks in Mongolia and later "probably influenced the formation of European discourse on Shamanism".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kollmar-Paulenz|first1=Karenina|title=The Invention of "Shamanism" in 18th Century Mongolian Elite Discourse|journal=Rocznik Orientalistyczny|date=2012|volume=LXV|issue=1|pages=90–106}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3363">A '''synthetic vaccine''' is a [[vaccine]] consisting mainly of synthetic [[peptides]], [[carbohydrate]]s, or [[antigen]]s. They are usually considered to be safer than vaccines from bacterial cultures. Creating vaccines synthetically has the ability to increase the speed of production. This is especially important in the event of a pandemic.

==History==
The world's first synthetic vaccine was created in 1982 from [[diphtheria]] toxin by [[Louis Chedid (scientist)]] from the [[Pasteur Institute]] and [[Michael Sela]] from the [[Weizmann Institute]].{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

In 1986, [[Manuel Elkin Patarroyo]] created the [[SPf66]], the first version of a synthetic vaccine for [[Malaria]].{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

During the H1N1 outbreak in 2009, vaccines only became available in large quantities after the peak of human infections. This was a learning experience for vaccination companies. [[Novartis]] Vaccine and Diagnostics, among other companies, developed a synthetic approach that very rapidly generates vaccine viruses from sequence data in order to be able to administer vaccinations early in the pandemic outbreak. Philip Dormatizer, the leader of viral vaccine research at Novartis, says they have "developed a way of chemically synthesizing virus genomes and growing them in tissue culture cells".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Susan |last=Young Rojahn |date=May 14, 2013 |url=http://www.technologyreview.com/news/514661/synthetic-biology-could-speed-flu-vaccine-production/ |title=Synthetic Biology Could Speed Flu Vaccine Production |work=MIT Technology Review }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Phase I data of UB-311, a synthetic peptide vaccine targeting amyloid beta, showed that the drug was able to generate antibodies to specific amyloid beta oligomers and fibrils with no decrease in antibody levels in patients of advanced age. Results from the Phase II trial are expected in the second half of 2018.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bioworld.com/content/alz-players-stand-united-new-beta-bids-also-fall{{full citation needed|date=November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pmid29067332&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.trci.2017.03.005 |pmid=29067332 |pmc=5651432 |title=UB-311, a novel UBITh ®  amyloid β peptide vaccine for mild Alzheimer's disease |journal=Alzheimer's &amp; Dementia: Translational Research &amp; Clinical Interventions |volume=3 |issue=2 |pages=262–272 |year=2017 |last1=Wang |first1=Chang Yi |last2=Wang |first2=Pei-Ning |last3=Chiu |first3=Ming-Jang |last4=Finstad |first4=Connie L |last5=Lin |first5=Feng |last6=Lynn |first6=Shugene |last7=Tai |first7=Yuan-Hung |last8=De Fang |first8=Xin |last9=Zhao |first9=Kesheng |last10=Hung |first10=Chung-Ho |last11=Tseng |first11=Yiting |last12=Peng |first12=Wen-Jiun |last13=Wang |first13=Jason |last14=Yu |first14=Chih-Chieh |last15=Kuo |first15=Be-Sheng |last16=Frohna |first16=Paul A }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Van Ingen &amp; Van Ingen''', simply '''Van Ingen''', or '''Van Ingen of Mysore''' (1900–1999) were Indian [[taxidermy|taxidermists]] located in [[Mysore]], [[South India]], best known for their [[tiger]] and [[leopard]] taxidermy trophy mounts. ''A History of Taxidermy. Art, science and bad taste'' (Morris, 2006) states that Van Ingen factory processed more than 43,000 [[tiger]] and [[leopard]] trophies in less than 90 years of operation. Van Ingen &amp; Van Ingen taxidermy today are still found throughout the world in the form of head mounts, full mounts, flat animal [[carpet|rug]]s, and rug mounts with heads attached. 

The Van Ingen &amp; Van Ingen firm was established by Eugene Van Ingen in the 1890s. His sons later ran the business until it closed in 1999.

Van Ingen &amp; Van Ingen served the highest in international nobility as well as the [[Maharaja]]s of India, preserving their "[[Hunting#Shikar (India)|shikar]]" [[hunting trophies]] in the most lifelike poses and in the utmost beauty, with attention to detail like no other in their time of operation.

== Work ==
[[File:Van Ingen snarling mount.jpg|thumb|Close up of a snarling Van Ingen mount]]

Van Ingen &amp; Van Ingen's work was synonymous with quality and fine workmanship, constructing moulds, mannikins, glass eyes, tongues, teeth and even whiskers for jobs of all different sizes of big cat skins and hunting trophies that customers would bring to them. The "snarling" open mouth expression of finished big cat mounts was one of the Van Ingen's trademark qualities, a feature rigorously studied and made possible only by special head moulds which had specific built grooves on the nose area. 

Glass eyes were imported from Germany, hand painted individually by a factory workman each pair painted specifically for each individual taxidermy mount. Van Ingen constructed mannikins and moulds of all sizes meaning they could produce mounts of consistent quality for a variety of poses from head mounts to full mount life size pieces.

In its heyday, Van Ingen &amp; Van Ingen was one of the biggest taxidermy businesses in the world. Factory records reveal that Van Ingen &amp; Van Ingen would process over 400 Tigers per year from the 1930s till the late 1960s limited to not only [[tiger]]s and [[leopard]]s, but also [[bear]]s, [[lion]]s, other species of cat, [[ungulate]]s and even African game. Film stars, [[viceroy]]s and senior military men were numbered among their customers, but at least a third of the taxidermy was done for the [[Indian nobility]]. The firm employed over 150 workers time to support the high workload, with jobs from cleaning, skinning, salting, pickling, mounting, carpentry, finishing, decorating and offloading. Work began to decline in the late 1960s, following the banning of hunting in India.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2011-10-13/mysore/30274596_1_mysore-zoo-taxidermy-mysore-palace They preserve wild spoils year after year]&lt;/ref&gt;

The firm remained lightly active until 1999 when it closed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2011-10-13/mysore/30274596_1_mysore-zoo-taxidermy-mysore-palace They preserve wild spoils year after year]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
In 2004, Pat Morris travelled to Mysore to document what would remain left of the taxidermy firm meeting the last survivor of business management Joubert Van Ingen. Morris would go on to author and publish the book ''Van Ingen &amp; Van Ingen - Artists in Taxidermy'' in 2006 &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.taxidermylaw.co.uk/regulations/history.cfm Taxidermy Law Library]&lt;/ref&gt; which outlines the quality, complexity and history of what once was one of the world's largest taxidermy firms. The book also contains actual photocopies of the factory workbook records of the Van Ingen work flow.

The Van Ingen &amp; Van Ingen book, ''Van Ingen &amp; Van Ingen, Artists in Taxidermy, Mysore'' (Morris, 2006) is considered the main source for information of the firm with studies of original factory records that reveal the abundance of wild leopards and tigers once found in the wild.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catsg.org/cheetah/05_library/5_3_publications/U_and_V/van_Ingen_&amp;_van_Ingen_1948_Interesting_Shikar_trophies_-_hunting_cheetah.pdf Library Catalog]&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the three brothers De Wet Van Ingen (now deceased), still holds the record for the largest [[Mahseer]] ever caught on a rod.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.flyfish.com/library/the-mahseer-of-india/513/ Flyfish Library]&lt;/ref&gt; A cast of the original fish caught was donated to the Regional Museum of Natural History (RMNH), Siddarthanagar, Mysore by Joubert. RMNH also houses a sizable collection of taxidermy mounts which are displayed all round the year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mysorenature.org/karanji/taxidermy-collection-in-mysore-area/museum-collection List of taxidermy mounts collection at Regional Museum of Natural History, Mysore]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Van Ingen &amp; Van Ingen today==
[[File:Van_Ingen_label.jpg|thumb|Label of a Van Ingen mount]]
Today, Van Ingen taxidermy mounts are found in private collections and museums &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mysorenature.org/karanji/taxidermy-collection-in-mysore-area/museum-collection List of taxidermy mounts collection at Regional Museum of Natural History, Mysore]&lt;/ref&gt; throughout the world. Some can be found in [[auction houses]] throughout [[United Kingdom|Britain]] at times finding fetching high prices.

Today there is little to no information regarding possibly one of the greatest taxidermy firms in the world, apart from P.A. Morris' studies. The Van Ingen factory in [[Mysore]], India lies derelict overgrown by the local jungle. The last member of the Van Ingens family Edwin Joubert Van Ingen (born 27 July 1912) died on 12 Mar 2013 in his Mysore residence. He was 101 years old.

A 160 million-year-old fossil of a sauropod, and stuffed animals by Van Ingen &amp; Van Ingen, were part of the museum collection that was destroyed in the April 2016 fire at the [[National Museum of Natural History, New Delhi]].

'''Van Wyck Brooks''' (February 16, 1886 in [[Plainfield, New Jersey]] &amp;ndash; May 2, 1963 in [[Bridgewater, Connecticut]]) was an American [[literary criticism|literary critic]], biographer, and historian.

== Biography ==
[[File:Jo-Cotten-FDR-LIFE-1944.jpg|thumb|right|260px|Members of the Independent Voters Committee of the Arts and Sciences for Roosevelt visit [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt|FDR]] at the White House (October 1944).

Brooks graduated from [[Harvard University]] in 1908.  As a student he published his first book, a collection of poetry called ''Verses by Two Undergraduates'', co-written with his friend [[John Hall Wheelock]].&lt;ref&gt;Sullivan, Roderick B. (February 2001). "Biography of John Hall Wheelock, Poet", ''Biographies of Notable Wheelocks.'' Retrieved 3 July 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Brooks' best-known work is a series of studies entitled ''Makers and Finders: A History of the Writer in America, 1800-1915'' (1952), which chronicled the development of [[American literature]] during [[the long 19th century]]. Brooks embroidered elaborate biographical detail into [[anecdote|anecdotal]] prose. For ''The Flowering of New England, 1815-1865'' (1936) he won the second [[List of National Book Award winners#1935 to 1941|National Book Award]] for Non-Fiction from the American Book Sellers Association&lt;ref name=nyt1936a&gt;

ProQuest Historical Newspapers The New York Times (1851-2007).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nyt1937&gt;"5 Honors Awarded on the Year's Books: ...", ''The New York Times'', 1937-02-26, p. 23. ProQuest Historical Newspapers The New York Times (1851-2007).&lt;/ref&gt; and the 1937 [[Pulitzer Prize for History]].  The book was also included in [[Life Magazine]]'s list of the 100 outstanding books of 1924-1944.&lt;ref&gt;Canby, Henry Seidel. "The 100 Outstanding Books of 1924 - 1944". ''Life Magazine'', 14 August 1944. Chosen in collaboration with the magazine's editors.&lt;/ref&gt;

Brooks was a long-time resident of [[Bridgewater, Connecticut]], which built a town library wing in his name. Although a decade-long fund-raising effort was abandoned in 1972, a hermit in Los Angeles, Charles E. Piggott, with no connection to Bridgewater surprised the town by leaving money for the library in his will. With $210,000 raised, the library addition went up in 1980.&lt;ref&gt;[http://burnhamlibrary.org/about/history/ Burnham Public Library Web site, Library History Web page, accessed May 4, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

Among his works, the book ''The Ordeal of Mark Twain'' (1920) analyzes the literary progression of [[Samuel L. Clemens]] and attributes shortcomings to Clemens' mother and wife. In 1925 he published a translation from French of the 1920 biography of Henry Thoreau by Leon Bazalgette, entitled ''Henry Thoreau, Bachelor of Nature''.

In 1944, Brooks was on the [[Lists of people on the cover of Time magazine|cover of ''Time Magazine'']].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,764443,00.html Time.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Westmoreland County coal strike of 1910–1911''', or the '''Westmoreland coal miners' strike''',&lt;ref&gt;[http://jrmcdono.myweb.uga.edu/HIST3072WestmorelandCountyCoalStrike.htm Westmoreland Coal Miner’s Strike 1910 – 1911]. Jrmcdono.myweb.uga.edu. Retrieved on 2013-07-23.&lt;/ref&gt; was a strike by [[coal mining|coal miners]] represented by the [[United Mine Workers of America]].  The strike is also known as the '''Slovak Strike''' because about 70 percent of the miners were [[Slovak people|Slovak]] immigrants.&lt;ref name="McDonough" /&gt; It began in [[Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania]], on March 9, 1910, and ended on July 1, 1911.  At its height, the strike encompassed 65 mines and 15,000 coal miners.&lt;ref name="McDonough"&gt;McDonough, "Worker Solidarity, Judicial Oppression, and Police Repression in the Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania Coal Miner's Strike, 1910–1911", ''Pennsylvania History,'' 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cupp"&gt;Cupp, "1910–11 Irwin Gas Coal Basin Strike Led to Industry Changes", ''Pittsburgh Tribune-Review,'' February 23, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Sixteen people were killed during the strike, nearly all of them striking miners or members of their families.&lt;ref name="Norwood"&gt;{{cite book|last=Norwood|first=Stephen H.|title=Strikebreaking and Intimidation: Mercenaries and Masculinity in Twentieth-Century America|year= 2002|publisher=The University of North Carolina Press|isbn=978-0807853733}}&lt;/ref&gt; The strike ended in defeat for the [[trade union|union]].

==Background==
The Irwin gas coal basin is an area in Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania.  It encompasses the townships of [[North Huntingdon Township, Pennsylvania|North Huntingdon]], [[Penn Township, Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania|Penn]], [[Sewickley, Pennsylvania|Sewickley]], [[Salem Township, Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania|Salem]], [[South Huntingdon Township, Pennsylvania|South Huntingdon]], [[Hempfield Township, Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania|Hempfield]] and [[Irwin Township, Pennsylvania|Irwin]], and the boroughs of [[Murrysville, Pennsylvania|Murrysville]], [[Export, Pennsylvania|Export]] and [[Delmont, Pennsylvania|Delmont]]. The coal mined in the district was unsuitable for use as [[coke (fuel)|coke]]. However, it was ideal for [[Coal pulverization|gasification]] and conversion into [[town gas|coal gas]].&lt;ref name="Cupp" /&gt;

Seven companies dominated coal mining in the Irwin Basin in 1910.  In 1854, the [[Westmoreland Coal]] Company was formed to begin mining coal in the region.  In 1905, it bought a controlling interest in Penn Gas Coal, a company established in 1861 to gasify coal. Penn Gas Coal, in turn, had obtained a one-third ownership in the [[Manor Gas Coal]] Company. Through these purchases, Westmoreland Coal had a near-monopoly on the gas coal market, and was the largest [[bituminous coal]] company in Pennsylvania.&lt;ref name="Cupp" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Westmoreland"&gt;"Westmoreland Coal Company Historical Timeline", Westmoreland Coal Company, No date.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1892, Robert Jamison and his sons founded the [[Jamison Coal and Coke]] Company (originally the Jamison Coal Company).&lt;ref&gt;Jamison Coal was sold to the [[Consolidation Coal Company]] in 1947, and is now [[Consol Energy]]. Van Atta, "When Jamison Coal Was King", ''Pittsburgh Tribune-Review,'' April 10, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1886, the Berwind family and Judge [[Allison White]] founded the [[Berwind-White Coal Mining Co.]]&lt;ref&gt;"History", Berwind Co., 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1902, a number of smaller coal gas companies in and around [[Greensburg, Pennsylvania]], merged to form the Keystone Coal and Coke Company. In 1905, [[Latrobe-Connellsville Coal and Coke]] Company was formed when [[Marcus W. Saxman]] merged three of his wholly owned or controlled coal companies.&lt;ref&gt;"First Saxman Settled Near Latrobe Shortly After Braddock's Defeat", ''Latrobe Bulletin,'' June 21, 1954.&lt;/ref&gt;

These companies were very paternalistic. [[Company town]]s (colloquially referred to as "coal patches") were established, [[Truck system|company stores]] founded and workers often paid in [[company scrip]].&lt;ref name="Cupp" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fishback, "Did Coal Miners 'Owe Their Souls to the Company Store'? Theory and Evidence from the Early 1900s", ''Journal of Economic History,'' December 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins of the strike==
Coal miners increasingly agitated for improved wages and working conditions after 1900. Miners demanded an [[eight-hour day]] and wages equal to those paid in the nearby [[Pittsburgh]] coal basin. Since miners were paid by the ton, workers also wanted to standardize the size of coal wagons to ensure they were paid fairly. Miners also sought to be paid for mining "slack" (very fine coal), and for "dead work" (laying of track, shoring up tunnels, pumping out water, and removing slate and clay).&lt;ref name="Cupp" /&gt;

Westmoreland Coal, Penn Gas Coal and Keystone Coal and Coke strongly resisted the miners' demands and any attempt at unionization. Companies used the [[Coal and Iron Police]] to physically intimidate and sometimes beat pro-union miners, workers were fired, and coal companies evicted families from the "coal patches" whenever miners struck.&lt;ref name="Cupp" /&gt;

The situation came to a head in 1910. The coal companies reduced wages by 16 percent, paying only 58 cents per ton-and-a-half of coal mined.  The breaking point came when Keystone Coal and Coke announced that miners would have to begin using new safety lights and new forms of explosives—and pay for these items themselves.&lt;ref name="McDonough" /&gt;

==Strike==
Miners' [[trade union|unions]] had tried to organize Westmoreland County coal mines since 1883, but had little success.  In February 1910, however, the lower wage rates and new expenses led miners at Keystone Coal and Coke to meet and discuss their grievances among themselves.  The miners decided to invite the [[United Mine Workers of America]] (UMWA) to form a union.&lt;ref name="McDonough" /&gt;

On March 7, 1910, [[Van Bittner]], a UMWA vice president, arrived in Westmoreland County and formed a local union.  Four hundred miners signed up and paid dues.  Keystone Coke and Coal immediately fired 100 miners for attending the union organizing meeting. The Keystone miners walked off the job, and the strike swiftly spread throughout the Irwin Basin.&lt;ref name="McDonough" /&gt;

Union recognition became the biggest issue in the strike. The workers felt that if they could win recognition of the union, their other demands would come easily.&lt;ref name="McDonough" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Report"&gt;''Report on the Miners' Strike in the Bituminous Coal Field in Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania in 1910–1911,'' U.S. House of Representatives, 1912.&lt;/ref&gt;

When the miners struck on March 9, the coal companies evicted thousands of families from their company-owned homes.  UMWA spent $25,000 purchasing tents and constructing shanties, and set up 25 tent cities to accommodate the homeless.  Near the town of Export, more than 100 tents went up, making it the largest tent city during the strike.&lt;ref name="McDonough" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Cupp" /&gt;

Ethnic tension threatened to divide the nascent union.  Slovakians comprised 70 percent of the striking miners, but the strike committee was led by native-born miners of English, [[Germans|German]] and Irish descent. UMWA organizers Bittner and [[Frank Hayes (unionist)|Frank Hayes]] worked hard to overcome these divisions, however. Multi-lingual organizers were employed, each ethnic group elected its own representatives, and parades and rallies featured musicians and speakers from all groups.&lt;ref name="McDonough" /&gt;

Public backing for the strike was high. Westmoreland County had a long history of support for unions. Local religious leaders signed petitions in favor of the union, testified before the [[United States Congress]] on behalf of workers, and called on the governor and state legislature to force the coal companies to submit to [[arbitration]].&lt;ref name="McDonough" /&gt;

UMWA support for the strike, however, was not nearly as strong. International union president [[Thomas Lewis (unionist)|Thomas Lewis]] had not condoned the strike, and criticized efforts by leaders in surrounding UMWA Districts to drum up increased support for the strikers. But in March 1910, a special meeting of the UMWA international executive board voted to support the strike, forcing Lewis to grudgingly offer the union's resources.&lt;ref name="McDonough" /&gt; Eventually, the union gave more than $1 million in relief payments to the strikers.&lt;ref name="Cupp" /&gt; Lewis, however, continued to work to undermine the union's support for the strike. He backed an insurgent faction in District 6 to unseat leaders who supported the strike. The act led to internecine warfare in the union and charges that Lewis and his candidates were in league with mine owners.&lt;ref name="McDonough" /&gt;

===Strikebreakers===
To end the strike and break the union, the coal companies began importing thousands of Eastern European immigrants to work the mines. Coal company representatives on the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] promised immigrants a job and housing, and paid for them and their families to move to Pennsylvania. The flow of [[strikebreaker]]s was small at first, but by the fall it was nearly a flood. The number of new immigrant workers was so large that the Penn Gas Coal company constructed 30 two-story houses in Hahntown to house its replacement workers, leading local residents to refer to the area as "Scab Hill".&lt;ref name="Cupp" /&gt;

Management often took advantage of the strikebreakers, however. Company recruiters were ordered not to tell potential workers that they would be employed as [[strikebreaker]]s. The coal companies sought out recent immigrants who did not speak English (or who spoke or understood it poorly), and then used this handicap against the strikebreakers. If workers tried to quit, the [[Coal and Iron Police]] prevented them from leaving and told them that they had to work off the cost of their transportation before resigning. When strikebreakers still tried to leave, the police beat them and forced them back to work. In some cases, fences were built around strikebreaker housing to intimidate the workers into staying. The abuse of strikebreakers was so severe that the [[United States House Committee on Education and Labor|U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Labor]] held hearings on whether the coal companies had illegally forced people into [[peonage]].&lt;ref name="McDonough" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hearings"&gt;''The Hearings on H. R. 179, Authorizing Committee on Labor to Investigate Conditions Existing in Westmoreland Coal Fields of Pennsylvania,'' Committee on Rules, U.S. House of Representatives, May 31, 1911.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In Herminie, a twelve-foot fence surrounded the barracks of the strikebreakers. Mine owner John Jamison told a local official, "We are going to make &lt;nowiki&gt;[the strikebreakers]&lt;/nowiki&gt; a far sight more afraid of us than &lt;nowiki&gt;[the strikers]&lt;/nowiki&gt;." Kuritz, "The Labor Injunction in Pennsylvania, 1891–1931", ''Pennsylvania History,'' July 1962.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Peonage"&gt;''Peonage in Western Pennsylvania,'' Committee on Labor, U.S. House of Representatives, August 1, 1911.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Labor injunctions and other legal actions===
Employers also turned to the courts for assistance.  In April 1910, Keystone Coal and Coke sought a [[restraining order]] to prevent striking miners from approaching company property on the grounds that the number of strikers and the loud noises they made intimidated company employees. Although the local sheriff testified that the strikers had committed no acts of violence, the state district court issued a sweeping injunction which essentially barred the union from use of public roads:
:Miners are restrained from conducting or engaging in marches to the mines, property and works of said Keystone Coal and Coke Company and from assembling at or near the works of said company for the purpose of holding meetings at such places at any time, and from assembling on the highways at such places where the employees of the said company ordinarily pass to and from their work, and from preventing said employees from going peaceably along said injunction: highways and also from attempting by noise, intimidation, threats, personal violence or by any other means to interfere with the employees of said company in their desire to labor or with any of the property of the said company until further order of this court.&lt;ref&gt;Cited in McDonough, "Worker Solidarity, Judicial Oppression, and Police Repression in the Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania Coal Miner's Strike, 1910–1911", ''Pennsylvania History,'' 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;
The vague terms of the injunction led law enforcement officials to arrest miners as much as a half mile from Keystone grounds. Other coal companies quickly asked for similar injunctions which "made marching, assembling or traversing public roads illegal".&lt;ref name="Report" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McDonough, "Worker Solidarity, Judicial Oppression, and Police Repression in the Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania Coal Miner's Strike, 1910–1911", ''Pennsylvania History,'' 1997, p. 395.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The court injunctions issued in the Westmoreland County Coal Strike were not only applied in later strikes in Pennsylvania but was extended even further. Kuritz, "The Labor Injunction in Pennsylvania, 1891–1931", ''Pennsylvania History,'' July 1962.&lt;/ref&gt;

The coal companies moved aggressively to exploit the law in other ways as well.  The Coal and Iron Police patrolled company property and denied admittance to union members and supporters. Union members were often arrested for using public roads which traversed company property.&lt;ref name="Kuritz"&gt;Kuritz, "The Labor Injunction in Pennsylvania, 1891–1931", ''Pennsylvania History,'' July 1962.&lt;/ref&gt; Small towns and villages, often encircled by coal company land, became isolated and embattled. In [[Herminie, Pennsylvania|Herminie]], all citizens were required to obtain a pass from the local mine manager before leaving the village. Union members were denied the use of post offices or the ability to enter local courthouses, because these facilities were often on coal company property. Nearly 1,000 miners were ultimately arrested for trespass or disorderly conduct.&lt;ref name="McDonough" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Report" /&gt; Simply walking home in a group from a union meeting on a public highway could earn a contempt citation and a $50 fine.&lt;ref name="Report" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kuritz" /&gt;

In 1911, seven coal companies in Westmoreland County and [[Allegheny County, Pennsylvania|Allegheny County]] sued the leaders of the strike. The coal companies claimed they had suffered economic losses as high as $500,000 due to the strike and strike-related property damage. Twenty-eight officers in nearby District 5 and 17 strike leaders in Westmoreland County were arrested on charges of conspiracy, intimidation, violence and general lawlessness. Local labor unions helped the 45 men post bond of $300 each, and instituted a special per capita assessment to form a legal defense fund. But the public outcry was so extraordinary that the coal companies dropped the suits.&lt;ref name="McDonough" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Report" /&gt;

===Use of security personnel===
Employers also used force to intimidate striking miners. At their disposal were the [[Coal and Iron Police]], local law enforcement personnel, and the [[Pennsylvania State Police]].

*The Coal and Iron Police primarily protected company property, protected strikebreakers, and kept strikebreakers from quitting.&lt;ref name="Cupp" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Report" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Peonage" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kuritz" /&gt; But in many ways, their role in the strike was quite limited.
*[[Sheriff's deputies]] and local police deputies proved to be a much bigger problem. The coal companies paid the Westmoreland County sheriff to provide deputies to protect their property and replacement workers (a common practice at the time). Although the sheriff's deputies would be acting under the color of law, they were paid for and under the control of the coal companies. The Westmoreland County sheriff obtained many deputies through "[[detective agency|detective agencies]]" notorious of their strikebreaking activities, but nevertheless instructed the deputies to exercise restraint and ignore peaceful marches.  He also warned them that he would dismiss deputies who committed acts of violence.&lt;ref name="McDonough" /&gt;

Despite this, sheriff's deputies instigated and participated in three particularly violent and deadly incidents:
*On May 8, 1910, sheriff's deputies attempted to prevent a handful of strikebreakers from permanently quitting their jobs at the Westmoreland Coal Company in the town of Yukon, Pennsylvania. About four hours after the replacement workers had returned to their boarding house, 25 sheriff's deputies and Pennsylvania state policemen broke into and searched the boarding house. A crowd of striking miners gathered and ridiculed their failure to find the workers. The furious and embarrassed sheriff's deputies then fired into the crowd. Thirty people were injured and one man killed.&lt;ref name="McDonough" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Report" /&gt; The Westmoreland County sheriff withdrew the commissions of 18 deputies involved in the incident, but the Westmoreland Coal Company had them sworn in as local police deputies instead.&lt;ref name="McDonough" /&gt;
*Shortly after the Yukon incident, a small group of miners walking home from a meeting in Export passed coal company property. A squad of 20 sheriff's deputies and State Police troopers attacked them. Several miners were severely beaten, and one miner (trying to protect a child in his arms) was killed.&lt;ref name="McDonough" /&gt;
*In July 1910, striking miners secured a march permit from the town of [[South Greensburg, Pennsylvania|South Greensburg]]. As the miners began their march, deputy sheriffs and Coal and Iron Police on horseback stopped them. Although the local chief of police stepped forward and told the deputies that the miners had permission to march, the deputies ignored him and continued to block the marchers. The miners attempted to walk away, but the deputies charged into them with their horses, swinging clubs. A riot ensued and the sheriff's deputies fired into the crowd—killing a miner. When the chief of police attempted to arrest the deputy responsible, the other deputies seized him and charged him with obstructing an officer in the performance of his duty. Outraged citizens of the town mobbed the sheriff's office and forced his release.&lt;ref name="McDonough" /&gt;
Problems with the deputies were so severe that in November 1910 the Westmoreland County sheriff stopped securing them for the coal companies. The companies responded by seeking deputies from local police forces instead.&lt;ref name="McDonough" /&gt;

In January 1911, the Westmoreland County sheriff began deputizing striking miners as deputy sheriffs (although they served without pay). In May 1911, four sheriff's deputies were cited for contempt of court for venturing too close to coal company property. The sheriff said that the men had done so in their official capacity as deputies, but the local court fined them anyway.&lt;ref name="McDonough" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Report" /&gt; The Westmoreland County sheriff became so frustrated with the injunction that he refused to permit his deputies to patrol marches on public highways.&lt;ref name="Kuritz" /&gt;

The [[Pennsylvania State Police]] (PSP) proved to be the most violent group during the strike. The PSP had been founded in 1905 to discourage the use of private police forces in workers' strikes and to provide law enforcement when local police or sheriffs were unable or unwilling to enforce the law. But rather than enforce the law, the PSP proved the group most willing to break it. One trooper described how the State Police dealt with strikers: "We ride in, scoop them up and beat hell out of them."&lt;ref name="Norwood" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McDonough, "Worker Solidarity, Judicial Oppression, and Police Repression in the Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania Coal Miner's Strike, 1910–1911", ''Pennsylvania History,'' 1997, p. 397.&lt;/ref&gt;

The number of unprovoked violent acts committed by the PSP was extremely high and frequent.  [[James Maurer]], a socialist member of the [[Pennsylvania General Assembly]] from [[Reading, Pennsylvania|Reading]], conducted a survey asking for information on State Police actions during the strike. Maurer's survey found that violence significantly increased after the arrival of the State Police, and that almost all acts of violence were committed by state troopers without provocation. Mauer was so outraged by the results of his survey that he introduced a bill to abolish the state police.&lt;ref name="McDonough" /&gt; Hundreds of citizens later testified before state and federal commissions that mounted State Police routinely charged onto town sidewalks or into crowds, trampling and severely injuring men, women and children (whether strikers or not). Severe beatings with fists and clubs were common, with troopers breaking into and ransacking homes without warrants, beating citizens and striking miners alike. Local police officials claimed State Police routinely beat people on the street for no reason, and resisted local police attempts to stop them. State Police troopers shot up towns "in true Western style", and fired indiscriminately into crowds or into tent cities (killing and wounding sleeping women and children). Sexual assault (including rape) was disturbingly common, and at least one hotel manager accused troopers of promoting prostitution.&lt;ref name="Norwood" /&gt;

State Police were also involved in a number of serious violent incidents, several of which resulted in the deaths of unarmed strikers:
*In May 1910, State Police allegedly killed a man in cold blood. Several State Police officers and a coal company executive stopped and questioned four striking miners who did not speak English. An English-speaking miner who spoke their language came on the scene and told the four men to run off.  They did so and escaped, but the State Police troopers chased the fifth man into a barn. The miner was shot and killed. The numerous witnesses testified that the miner was begging for his life when a State Trooper shot him. But the other troopers and a coal company executive stated that the miner was killed in self-defense, and the trooper was exonerated.&lt;ref name="McDonough" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Report" /&gt;
*In May 1911, State Police assaulted a group of striking miners on a public road. The miners, on their way to a meeting, walked past property owned by the Jamison Coal and Coke Company. The road narrowed where a creek ran past the property.  The mounted State Police troopers blocked the mines' path at this point, then charged into the crowd. Two miners were shot and several severely beaten. A Westmoreland County sheriff's deputy accompany the miners was also badly beaten.&lt;ref name="McDonough" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hearings" /&gt;
*In June 1911, miners secured a permit to march past facilities owned by the Penn Gas Coal Company. As the marchers peacefully walked past the company's front gate, State Police opened fire.  More than 150 shots were fired, causing panic and several injuries. Westmoreland County sheriff's deputies (all miners) identified three of the troopers and went to Penn Gas Coal Company to arrest them. Instead, [[Pennsylvania State Police]] and Coal and Iron Police arrested the deputies for violating the court injunction. A court sentenced the deputies to five days in jail. When the Westmoreland County sheriff refused to put his deputies in jail, the court ordered the sheriff's arrest and charged him with [[malfeasance]]. Despite the pleas of a jury, the court sentenced the sheriff to one year and three months in solitary confinement and hard labor.&lt;ref name="McDonough" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Report" /&gt;

During the strike, six striking miners, nine wives of striking miners, and one bystander were killed, and thousands of strikers and members of their families severely beaten or wounded.&lt;ref name="McDonough" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Norwood" /&gt;

==End of the strike==
By mid-1911, the strike had taken its toll on the coal companies. At least $500,000 had been spent on security, and coal production had dropped by 45 percent.&lt;ref name="Cupp" /&gt; The larger companies, however, used their [[financial reserves]] and income from non-mining operations (such as rental properties, company stores and even breweries) to withstand the economic pressure exerted by the miners. But all companies benefited from a significant slump in the demand for coal in 1910 and 1911, which leveled the playing field vis-a-vis their competitors.&lt;ref name="McDonough" /&gt;

But the miners were worse off than the employers. The winter of 1910–11 was particularly cold, and the miners and their families suffered tremendously. The union built numerous shacks and shanties, and moved miners' families out of tents and into the shacks for better protection from the elements. But not enough shelter could be erected, and 400 families spent the entire winter in tents. Hunger and disease were also beginning to become widespread among strikers' families.&lt;ref name="McDonough" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Cupp" /&gt;

In early 1911, the UMWA's support for the strikers appeared strong. In January 1911, Lewis lost the presidency of UMWA to [[John White (unionist)|John P. White]]. White fully backed the strike, and the UMWA convention reaffirmed the union's support for the miners.&lt;ref name="McDonough" /&gt;

But just six months later, the UMWA called a halt to the strike. The union had disbursed more than $1 million in [[strike relief]] funds, but it was no longer financially able to keep the strike going.&lt;ref name="McDonough" /&gt; On July 1, 1911, the UMWA executive board voted to end to the strike. Although most miners returned to work, about 400 were [[Blacklist (employment)|blacklist]]ed and forced to seek employment outside Pennsylvania.&lt;ref name="McDonough" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Cupp" /&gt;

==Women's resistance==
The Westmoreland County coal strike was the setting for one of the more colorful incidents in the life of [[Mary Harris Jones]], better known as "Mother Jones". Even though she was 73 years of age, Mother Jones agreed to travel to Westmoreland County to support the United Mine Workers in their strike.{{cn|date=March 2018}}

===Singing women===
A number of miners' wives had been arrested in the summer of 1910 for harassing strikebreakers and company security personnel.&lt;ref name="McDonough" /&gt;

Jones encouraged the women to bring their babies and small children with them when they were sentenced by the court in Greensburg. The presiding judge sentenced the women to pay a $30 fine or serve 30 days in jail. Unable to pay, the women were jailed. As there was no one else to care for the children, the judge was forced to jail the children along with their mothers.{{cn|date=March 2018}}

While the women were being processed for imprisonment, Jones instructed them:  "You sing the whole night long. You can spell one another if you get tired and hoarse. Sleep all day and sing all night and don't stop for anyone. Say you're singing to the babies. I will bring the little ones milk and fruit. Just you all sing and sing."&lt;ref name="Jones"&gt;[[Mary Harris Jones]]: ''The Autobiography of Mother Jones.'' 4th ed., 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

Unfortunately, the jail was next door to the sheriff's home, as well as several hotels, lodging houses, and other homes. The sound of women singing all through the night kept most of the townspeople awake.  After five days of sleeplessness, the townspeople angrily demanded that the judge order the women's release. He did so.&lt;ref name="Jones" /&gt;

The incident has become known as "the women who sang their way out of jail".{{cn|date=March 2018}}
