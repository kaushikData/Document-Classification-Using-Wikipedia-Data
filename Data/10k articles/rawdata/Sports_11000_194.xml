'''1790 in sports''' describes the year's events in world sport.

==[[Boxing]]==
'''Events'''
* 30 August — "Big" Ben Brain and William Hooper fought to a 3 hour &amp; 30 minute 180th round fight at Chapel Row Level, it was a draw.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cyberboxingzone.com/boxing/brain-benjamin.htm Cyber Boxing Zone - Ben Brain]. Retrieved on 20 January 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Tom Johnson (bareknuckle boxer)|Tom Johnson]] retained his English championship but no fights involving him are recorded in 1790.

Retrieved on 7 November 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==[[Cricket]]==
'''Events'''
* The emergence of [[Brighton Cricket Club]] heralded a revival of [[Sussex county cricket teams|Sussex cricket]] which had been prominent in the early 18th century, the Brighton team being a fair representation of Sussex as a county.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}
'''England'''
* Most runs&lt;ref name="cards"&gt;Note that scorecards created in the 18th century are not necessarily accurate or complete; therefore any summary of runs, wickets or catches can only represent the '''known''' totals and the missing data prevents effective computation of averages&lt;/ref&gt; – [[Billy Beldham]] 317
* Most wickets&lt;ref name="cards"/&gt; – [[Robert Clifford (cricketer)|Robert Clifford]] 33

==[[Horse racing]]==
'''England'''
* [[Epsom Derby|The Derby]] – [[Rhadamanthus (horse)|Rhadamanthus]]
* [[Epsom Oaks|The Oaks]] – Hippolyta

The '''[[Eredivisie|Netherlands Football League Championship]] 1895/1896''' was contested by seven teams from the cities [[Amsterdam]], [[The Hague]], [[Haarlem]], [[Rotterdam]] and [[Wageningen]]. The teams participated in the competition that would later be called ''Eerste Klasse West''. But since the western football district of the Netherlands was the only one to have a competition at the time, it could be regarded as a national championship. This was also the reason that [[GVC (football club)|Go Ahead Wageningen]] participated, as they would later play in the eastern division. [[HVV Den Haag]] won the championship.

==History==
[[Taichung]], China was selected to be the host city for the first East Asian Youth Games on October 24, 2014 during the 32nd East Asian Games Association Council Meeting in [[Beijing]], [[China]]&lt;ref name="host"/&gt;. The [[Taichung City Government]] originally planned to establish a committee for the Games in December 2014,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sport.taichung.gov.tw/ct.asp?xItem=1468545&amp;ctNode=22867&amp;mp=104020|title=臺中申辦2019年東亞青運成功三部曲|last=朱克明|date=2015-06-17|website=www.sport.taichung.gov.tw|access-date=2016-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; but this was postponed until June 26, 2015, when the 2019 East Asian Youth Games Organization Committee (2019年東亞青年運動會籌備委員會) was set up.&lt;ref name="籌委會成立"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.peoplenews.tw/news/2a8d773d-a26a-46e4-8d0f-f680dae29bb9 |title=第一屆東亞青運籌委會正式揭牌 進入熱身起跑階段 |location=臺中 |publisher=民報 |date=2015-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was to be the first time Taichung City had organised an international multi-sport event, as well as being the first East Asian Youth Games. On July 31, 2018, Taichung was stripped of hosting rights after a vote by the East Asian Olympic Committee.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.insidethegames.biz/articles/1068184/taiwan-stripped-of-2019-east-asian-youth-games-amid-dispute-with-china&lt;/ref&gt; The cancellation was to due to Chinese anger over public calls in Taiwan for a referendum on whether Taiwan should be allowed to compete under the name "Taiwan" at the [[2020 Summer Olympics]] and [[Taiwan independence movement|pro-independence campaign]], or should continue to compete under the name "[[Chinese Taipei]]", as it has been forced to acquiesce to since the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2018/04/09/what-is-chinese-taipei |title= What is Chinese Taipei? |publisher= [[The Economist]] |date= April 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sports==
There would have been be ten core sports events and two non-core sports events during the East Asian Youth Games. The core events were to be athletics, aquatics (swimming and diving), judo, taekwondo, three to three basketball, futsal, table tennis, badminton, tennis (tennis and soft tennis), and beach volleyball. Cycling and canoeing were to be non-core events.&lt;ref name="host"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sports.ettoday.net/news/417346|title=台中2019東亞青運　奧運五環旗首現台灣主辦國際運動會 |date=2014-10-24 |language=zh-t|accessdate=18 December 2016|location=Taiwan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Bay of Fundy International Marathon''' is a [[marathon]] between [[Lubec, Maine]], United States and [[Campobello Island]], [[New Brunswick]], Canada. A 10K is also organized alongside the marathon. The 10K takes place entirely within Lubec.&lt;ref name="Cox"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://bangordailynews.com/2014/06/11/sports/bay-of-fundy-international-marathon-runners-to-flock-down-east/|title=Bay of Fundy International Marathon runners to flock Down East|last=Cox|first=Tim|date=June 11, 2014|work=[[Bangor Daily News]]|accessdate=15 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The race begins at [[West Quoddy Head Lighthouse]], which is the eastern most point in the United States. 
Runners cross the [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt Bridge]] connecting Maine to New Brunswick and run until they reach [[Head Harbour Lighthouse]] (East Quoddy Lighthouse), at which time the runners turn around and return to Lubec.&lt;ref name="Cox"/&gt;

The first marathon was run in 2013. It included over 500 registered runners and was held in June. The race provided significant economic benefits to the area. The 2014 edition featured fewer runners (286 total). The organizers attributed the decrease to the "Boston effect" whereas marathon runners chose other marathons in run in order to qualify for the [[2014 Boston Marathon]].&lt;ref name="Cox"/&gt;

'''Bob Wren Stadium''' is a [[baseball]] stadium located in [[Athens, Ohio]] on the campus of [[Ohio University]].  It serves as the home field for the [[Ohio Bobcats baseball|Ohio Bobcats]] since opening on April 18, 1998. The Bobcats opened the facility by defeating the [[Bowling Green Falcons baseball|Bowling Green Falcons]] 4–1 in front of 1,389 fans.

[[File:OU Bob Wren Statue.JPG|left|thumb|A statue of Bob Wren located just outside the stadium]]
Bob Wren Stadium features many modern amenities and has a capacity of 4,000. The stadium has 100 chairback seats that are part of the VIP club, named the Baumholtz club in honor of former Ohio baseball player Frank Baumholtz. In addition, there are around 1,000 bleacher-back seats in the stadium and another 1,000 seats of regular bleachers. Down both the third and first base lines there are two grassy knolls that are capable of seating up to another 1,000 fans.

There are two concession stands available with traditional ballpark fare, and members of the Baumholtz Club have access to a private lounge that serves more upscale food items. The press box provides multiple phones and computer lines for members of the media. There are also two radio broadcast booths and one television broadcast booth available.

The stadium has already undergone several modifications since opening. In 2003, a large Daktronics digital scoreboard was added to the outfield of the stadium. That same year, heated batting cages were added to the northeast of the stadium, allowing Bobcat players to practice inside during cold weather. Most recently, lights were installed in 2004. As a result of this new addition, 15 of Ohio's 28 home games in 2005 were played at night.

The stadium is named for former Bobcat head coach Bob Wren, who held the highest all-time winning percentage of any Ohio baseball coach. 

In addition to serving as the home of Ohio Bobcats baseball, Bob Wren Stadium is home to the [[Southern Ohio Copperheads]] of the [[Great Lakes Summer Collegiate League]] and is the home of the state [[American Legion]] baseball tournament every year.

The '''Bombardier Bombi''' or '''BR 100''' is a small dual [[tracked vehicle]] which is used for grooming ski and snowmobile trails. Its weight is around 900&amp;nbsp;kg. it measures approximately 2.7(9&amp;nbsp;ft) x 1.8 meters (6&amp;nbsp;ft).

As a result of its wide tracks, [58&amp;nbsp;cm (23&amp;nbsp;inches) in winter and 45&amp;nbsp;cm (18&amp;nbsp;inches) in summer], it exerts as little as 0.54 and 0.70 psi of ground pressure at 125&amp;nbsp;mm (6&amp;nbsp;inches) penetration and it can operate on 60% horizontal and 80% vertical slopes; its top speed is 20&amp;nbsp;mph or 32&amp;nbsp;km/h. This is achieved with a 1.6 litre or 98 cu. in. 57&amp;nbsp;hp. inline [[Straight-4|four cylinder]] Ford industrial engine, the same as that used in the [[Ford Cortina]].

'''Gressbanen''' or '''Vestre Holmen''' is a stadium located at [[Holmen, Oslo|Holmen]] in [[Oslo]], [[Norway]]. During summer it has [[artificial turf]] and is used for [[association football]], while during winter it has [[artificial ice]] and fields [[bandy]]. The complex also contains a smaller training field with gravel during summer and natural ice during winter. Gressbanen is the home venue of [[IF Ready]], whose bandy team plays in the [[Norwegian Bandy Premier League]] and who fields 35 recreational football teams.

The stadium was built as a response to the need for a grass pitch for the [[Norway national football team]], as well as to serve as a home to Ready and [[Mercantile SFK]]. It opened on 1 September 1918 as the second grass pitch in Norway and the first in Oslo. As such it replaced [[Frogner Stadion]] as the home of the national team, for which it was home to seventeen matches. The national team moved to [[Ullevaal Stadion]] in 1927. Gressbanen also featured two [[List of Norwegian Football Cup finals|Norwegian Football Cup Final]], in [[1920 Norwegian Football Cup Final|1920]] and [[1921 Norwegian Football Cup Final|1921]]. The pitch has been iced and used for bandy since 1935. Mercantile remained a tenant until 1947, when it merged with [[SFK Trygg]]. Gressbanen received artificial turf in 2001 and artificial ice in 2004.

==History==
During the 1910s there were no grass football pitches in Norway. At the time the only proper football fields in Oslo were [[Bislett Stadion]] and Frogner Stadion, the latter which was at first used by the national team.&lt;ref&gt;Larsen: 82&lt;/ref&gt; The Football Association of Norway took initiative in 1911 to study the possibility for a grass field and conducted visits to [[Idrætsparken]] in [[Copenhagen]] and [[Stockholm Olympic Stadium]] to investigate how the neighboring capitals had resolved the issue.&lt;ref&gt;Larsen: 83&lt;/ref&gt; The main concern was that a grass field located in the Norwegian climate would not survive the winter. Also financing was a challenge, as none of the local clubs, nor the federation, had capital to construct a grass venue. In 1914 the Norway national team had lost 7–0 against Sweden on the grass pitch at [[Råsunda Stadium]], with the press stating that "grass has become our ruin", pointing out how the Norwegian players were unable to handle the wet surface.&lt;ref name=l84&gt;Larsen: 84&lt;/ref&gt;

The initiative to build a grass field at Holmen came from M. W. Aas, who had visited [[Vienna]] in 1915 and had observed the possibilities created there. He gained the support from Mercantile SFK and later also Ready. To construct the venue the limited company A/S Græsbanen was incorporated on 3 April 1916 with a share capital of 42,000 [[Norwegian krone]] (NOK).&lt;ref name=l84 /&gt; Ready and Mercantile appointed an equal number of board members in the company.&lt;ref&gt;Andersen: 381&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Stavanger Stadion]] opened with Norway's first grass pitch in 1917.&lt;ref name=l84 /&gt; The success of the [[1917 Norwegian Football Cup Final|1917 Cup Final]] demonstrated the qualities of a grass field and resulted in NFF establishing a fund which could lend money to clubs intending to build a grass pitch.&lt;ref&gt;Larsen: 85&lt;/ref&gt; Gressbanen was the first venue to be lent money through the arrangement, receiving funding for the stands. As the first grass field in the capital, Gressbanen was also selected as the home venue of the national team.&lt;ref name=l86&gt;Larsen: 86&lt;/ref&gt;

Construction was supported financially by among others NFF president [[Daniel Eie]] and director [[Johan Throne Holst]]. The lot, at the time in [[Aker, Norway|Aker]], was owned by shipowner [[Olaf Ditlev-Simonsen]] and donated the land to the company. He also paid for a road, water and sewer line to the venue.&lt;ref&gt;Andersen: 381–382&lt;/ref&gt; The official opening of Gressbanen took place on 1 September 1918, in front of an audience of 10,000.&lt;ref name=l86 /&gt; The opening match was between a combined Kristiania team and [[AIK Fotboll|AIK]] from Stockholm.&lt;ref&gt;Andersen: 382&lt;/ref&gt; The venue was inaugurated as a national stadium the following year.&lt;ref name=l86 /&gt; NFF remained a tenant at Gressbanen until 1926, when it moved its games to the newly constructed Ullevaal Stadion, which also served as the home of [[Lyn Fotball|Lyn]].&lt;ref&gt;Larsen: 88&lt;/ref&gt; Gressbanen was iced for the first time in 1932.&lt;ref&gt;Stang: 47&lt;/ref&gt;

The combination of natural grass and natural ice gave poor conditions for both bandy and football players. Lack of refrigeration caused the ice to only lay during the coldest part of the winter. The ice took its toll on the grass, causing it to not have grown properly until midway through the summer season. Increased population further raised the number of recreational teams which played on the field, causing further wear as 35 teams were scheduled to play on the two fields. Ready therefore took initiative to upgrade the venue as a combined artificial turf and artificial ice stadium, similar to the solution chosen at [[Skien Isstadion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Kunstis og kunstgress på samme flate Ready vil ha helårsbane |last=Hole |first=Arne |work=[[Aftenposten Aften]] |date=6 December 1999 |page=20 |language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Oslo Municipality granted NOK&amp;nbsp;7.7 million for the first part of construction in March 2000, which in addition to other funding secured the necessary NOK&amp;nbsp;13.4 million for the first stage. This consisted of the laying of refrigeration tubes under the soil and the artificial turf. The construction of pumps and cooling central was delayed till the second stage.&lt;ref name=hole&gt;{{cite news |title=Kunstgress og kunstis på samme sted Ready får helårsbane|last=Hole |first=Arne |work=[[Aftenposten Aften]] |date=9 March 2000 |page=23 |language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first stage opened on 18 August 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Kombinert-anlegg gir bredde og resultater |last=Hole |first=Arne |work=[[Aftenposten Aften]] |date=9 March 2000 |page=23 |language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt; The artificial ice facilities were completed in 2004. Thus Gressbanen was the third bandy field in Oslo to receive artificial ice and the eleventh overall in Norway.&lt;ref name=nbf&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bandyforbundet.no/bandy/anlegg.asp |title=Anlegg |publisher=Norwegian Bandy Federation |language=Norwegian |accessdate=3 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Facilities==
Gressbanen consists of two playing fields and is located in the Holmen neighborhood of [[Vestre Aker]] in Oslo. The venues are owned by Oslo Municipality and operated by Ready. The larger venue features artificial turf during summer and artificial ice during winter, while the smaller venue has gravel during summer and natural ice during winter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bymiljoetaten.oslo.kommune.no/idrett_og_fritid/alle_idrettsanlegg/article127723-36269.html |title=Gressbanen Ready|publisher=Oslo Municipality |language=Norwegian |accessdate=3 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main surface measures {{convert|105|by|65|m|sp=us}},&lt;ref name=gk&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fotball.no/Community/Anlegg/Hjem/?fiksId=2761 |title=Gressbanen kunstgress |publisher=Football Association of Norway |language=Norwegian |accessdate=3 December 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130703143539/http://www.fotball.no/Community/Anlegg/Hjem/?fiksId=2761 |archivedate=3 July 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; while the smaller field measures {{convert|89|by|49|m|sp=us}}.&lt;ref name=gg&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fotball.no/Community/Anlegg/Hjem/?fiksId=2764 |title=Gressbanen grus |publisher=Football Association of Norway |language=Norwegian |accessdate=3 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both are illuminated at 100 [[lux]].&lt;ref name=gk /&gt;&lt;ref name=gg /&gt; The main field is one of nineteen artificial bandy rinks in Norway.&lt;ref name=nbf&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bandyforbundet.no/bandy/anlegg.asp |title=Anlegg |publisher=Norwegian Bandy Federation |language=Norwegian |accessdate=3 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nbf /&gt; Football is played from early March through the end of October, while the field is iced for bandy from 1 November to early March.&lt;ref name=hole /&gt;

Two cup finals have been held at Gressbanen. The [[1920 Norwegian Football Cup Final|1920 edition]] saw [[Ørn-Horten]] beat [[Frigg FK|Frigg]] 1–0 in front of 14,000 spectators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rsssf.no/1920/fcup |title=Cup final in Kristiania, October 17 |publisher=[[Rec.Sport.Soccer Statistics Foundation]] |accessdate=4 December 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080524093119/http://www.rsssf.no/1920/fcup |archivedate=24 May 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[1921 Norwegian Football Cup Final|following year]] Frigg took revenge by beating [[Odds BK|Odd]] 2–0 in front of 20,000 spectators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rsssf.no/1921/fcup |title=Cup final in Kristiania, October 17 |publisher=[[Rec.Sport.Soccer Statistics Foundation]] |accessdate=4 December 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080524093129/http://www.rsssf.no/1921/fcup |archivedate=24 May 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The venue was the home of the Norway national football team from 1919 to 1926, with an additional match played in 1927. The stadium's record attendance of 20,000 took place at the 14 September 1924 match against [[Denmark national football team|Denmark]].

The '''International Polo Club Palm Beach''', located in [[Wellington, Florida|Wellington]], [[Florida]], is one of the largest [[polo]] clubs in the world. The club includes several natural grass polo fields, two of which are part of stadiums.

==History==
Once home to humble agricultural lands, Wellington, Florida, has been developed into a world-famous [[Horse community|equestrian community]]. The sport of polo has been a major contributor to the city's development. In 1978, [[William T. Ylvisaker]] created polo fields and introduced the mallet and ball game to the city. In the late 1990s, private polo fields owned by [[Summerfield Johnston, Jr.]], Mickey Tarnapol, and [[John B. Goodman (industrialist/polo magnate)|John B. Goodman]] were combined to create a platform for [[Polo handicap|high-goal]] competition. In 2002, John B. Goodman, [[Patronage#Sports|patron]] of the Isla Carroll Polo team, took stewardship of these fields and founded the International Polo Club Palm Beach (IPC). The club then gained the guardianship of the 26-goal C.V. Whitney Cup polo tournament. In 2004, IPC set forth on its inaugural season while construction of the clubhouse and stadium were underway. In the following years, more polo fields were added, along with grandstands, private boxes, and other amenities. In 2013, IPC celebrated its 10th anniversary season.

==Amenities==
The main stadium holds approximately 1,640 spectators, making it the largest structure for viewing polo in the United States. Championship Field is used for Sunday matches during the winter season, and also for USPA junior polo tournaments, summer sports, equestrian-themed weddings, and corporate events.

The club has nine polo fields, an Olympic-size pool, a spa and fitness center, and a tournament-approved croquet lawn and club. It also has two tennis courts and a tennis pavilion, a wine room, and the largest collection of polo books on earth.

The restaurant seats 120 and is named The Mallet Grille after its famous mallet sculpture centerpiece designed by M. Maison, the club’s designer. The centerpiece contains 120 mallets metaphorically representing the capacity of the restaurant. Lance is the Maitre' D/ assistant manager of the restaurant and a great asset to the club. The club bar is called the 7th Chukker.

The Pavilion is located across from Championship Field and is used for special functions, including Sunday Brunch and Polo, which is a mainstay during the 16-week winter season. The Pavilion seats 500 and has a large commercial kitchen, its own culinary staff separate from the club, and a covered veranda with views of the polo field.

==22 goal polo tournaments==

*C.V. Whitney Cup
*USPA Gold Cup®
*U.S. Open Polo Championship®

==Other sporting events==
IPC hosts non-polo sporting events, including the Junior District Lacrosse Championship, [[American Youth Soccer Organization]] National Games, Ultimate Frisbee Tournaments, the National Field Hockey Championship, and the National Field Hockey Festival, among others.

==Past tenants==
From 2000-2008, IPC was the home venue for the [[Palm Beach Pumas]], a member of the [[USL Premier Development League]]. IPC was a major sponsor of the Pumas.

==Management==
John A. Wash, CCM&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = John A. Wash CCM Official Website|url = http://johnwashccm.com|accessdate = 2015-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; was President of Club Operations since 2007. He was fired when new owners took over the club in 2017.
*Expansion of the polo facility, which includes a private club for members that features The Mallet Grille and The 7th Chukker
*Expansion of stadium seating, with private boxes for members and select guests
*Addition of several new, professional polo fields for weekday competition
*Expansion of the Pavilion from a tent to a 12,000-square-foot dining facility

*[[Cricket]]: [[South African cricket team in Sri Lanka in 2006|South Africa in Sri Lanka]]
**'''[[Test cricket|First Test]] at [[Colombo]] ([[Sinhalese Sports Club Ground|SSCG]]):''' [[Sri Lanka national cricket team|Sri Lanka]] defeats [[South Africa national cricket team|South Africa]] by an innings and 153 runs. South Africa, led by [[Ashwell Prince]], batted first after winning the toss, compiling 169 before being dismissed on the first-day tea break. Sri Lanka lost two early wickets before a record-breaking 624 run partnership between [[Kumar Sangakkara]] (287) and captain [[Mahela Jayawardene]] (374; 26 runs short of [[Brian Lara]]'s world-record individual score of 400). This partnership was particularly savage on [[Spin bowling|spinner]] [[Nicky Boje]], who ended with bowling figures of 0/221 from 65 overs. Sri Lanka were able to [[Declaration and forfeiture#Declaration|declare]] their innings closed at 756/5, leaving South Africa needing 587 runs just to make the home side bat again. Despite an opening partnership of 165, and solid performances in the middle order, [[Muttiah Muralitharan]]'s 6/131 restricted South Africa to 434. Sri Lanka leads to two-Test series 1–0.

**'''[[Test cricket|Second Test]] at [[Old Trafford Cricket Ground|Old Trafford]], [[Manchester]]:''' [[England cricket team|England]] defeats [[Pakistan national cricket team|Pakistan]] by an innings and 120 runs. Pakistan's decision to bat first after winning the toss proved disastrous, as the visitors were dismissed for a meagre 119 in their first innings, English [[fast bowling|fast bowler]] [[Steve Harmison]] claiming 6/19. England's reply of 461/9 [[Declaration and forfeiture#Declaration|declared]] centred on centuries to [[Alastair Cook]] (127) and [[Ian Bell]] (106 not out). Player-of-the-match Harmison (5/57) and [[Monty Panesar]] (5/72) combined to dismiss Pakistan for 222 in its second innings. England leads the four-Test series 1–0.

When a player is found by the umpire to have delivered the ball contrary to those rules, the umpire will call a [[no-ball]] and he is said to have been [[Throwing (cricket)|called for throwing]]. Where public opinion is that a player's bowling action appears to be that he routinely throws, he is said to have a 'suspect' or an 'illegal' action, or more derogatorily, is said to be a 'chucker'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Over the years, a number of players have been called in top-class matches — [[Test cricket|Test matches]], [[One Day International]]s and [[Cricket in Australia|domestic]] [[first-class cricket|first-class matches]] — invariably creating controversy and occasionally destroying cricket careers.&lt;ref&gt;Whimpress, p. 144.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Whimpress, p. 146.&lt;/ref&gt; Often the player has been able to modify his action to appease his critics and the umpires, but more commonly, especially when the bowler has been called on more than one occasion, his career in international cricket is effectively ended.&lt;ref&gt;Whimpress, pp. 5&amp;ndash;9.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nicollet Park''' is a former [[baseball]] ground located in [[Minneapolis, Minnesota]], United States. The ground was home to the minor league [[Minneapolis Millers]] of the [[Western League (U.S. baseball)|Western League]] and later [[American Association (20th century)|American Association]] from 1896 to 1955. During its first season (1896) it was officially known as '''Wright Field''', named for one of baseball's founding fathers, [[Harry Wright]]. The wood stadium was replaced by a steel and concrete stadium in 1912. Lights were installed in 1937.

The ballpark was on a small block bounded by [[Nicollet Avenue]] on the east, 31st Street on the south, Blaisdell Avenue on the west and Lake Street (or 30th Street) on the north in the present-day [[Lyndale, Minneapolis|Lyndale neighborhood]]. Home plate was in the southwest corner. A small ticket office building with a Spanish-style roof stood outside the right field corner, at the Nicollet-31st intersection.

[[Joe Hauser]] hit 69 homers for the Millers in 1933. [[Ted Williams]] also made a bit of a splash here in 1938, on his way up to the major leagues, registering 43 round-trippers to lead the league. [[Willie Mays]] was enjoyed by the Minneapolis fans for only a month or so in 1951 before the parent club [[New York Giants (NL)|New York Giants]] brought the young ballplayer to the big leagues.

Nicollet Park went out with a bang, as the Millers won the American Association championship tournament, and then went on to vie for the [[Junior World Series]] championship, facing the [[Rochester Red Wings]] of the [[International League]]. The series went the distance of 7 games, and the finale was a close-fought win for the Millers in what was also the final game at Nicollet Park. In 1956 the Millers moved to [[Metropolitan Stadium]] in the suburb of [[Bloomington, Minnesota|Bloomington]].

The park also held early [[National Football League]] games as the [[Minneapolis Marines/Red Jackets|Minneapolis Marines and Minneapolis Red Jackets]] played home games there during the 1920s. In 1944 the [[Minneapolis Millerettes]] of the [[All-American Girls Professional Baseball League]] called Nicollet Park home. Nicollet Park was also the place that the cereal [[Wheaties]] was first advertised. [[Augsburg University]]'s football team played their home games at Nicollet from 1946 to 1950. The [[New York Giants]] and [[Green Bay Packers]] played a preseason game on August 29, 1948 at Nicollet Park.

The ballpark site's current occupants include a branch location of [[Wells Fargo Bank]] (formerly [[Norwest Bank]]). There is a plaque detailing the ballpark's history, near the drive-up window which is positioned near what was once the center field corner. A condominium building is on the north front of Lake Street with a [[Hennepin County Medical Center]] clinic.&lt;ref&gt;[http://intownonlakecondos.com/ Intown on Lake Condos]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hcmc.org/depts/fmc.htm Family Medical Center]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Parkneuk Sports Stadium''' was a greyhound racing and speedway track on Milton Street, [[Motherwell]], [[North Lanarkshire]], [[Scotland]].

The track was situated west of Milton Street and built in 1949 on the site of the Parkneuk Colliery pit numbers 1 and 2.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.old-maps.co.uk/#/Map/275239/657816/13/101329|title=OS Plan 1958|publisher=old-maps.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also went by the name of 'The Stadium' and the Lanarkshire Speedway and Sports Stadium. The greyhound racing was independent (unaffiliated to a governing body) and opened on 15 October. The [[Motherwell Eagles|Lanarkshire Eagles]] speedway team also rode at the venue from 1950-1954.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Barnes|first=Julia|title=Daily Mirror Greyhound Fact File|pages =34–97|year=1988|publisher=Ringpress Books|isbn=0-948955-15-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; It competed for many years with another independent greyhound track called the [[Clyde Valley Greyhound Track]] at the bottom of Airbles Road.

Greyhound racing ended in 1972 and the site today consists of the Daisy Park Community Centre and Our Lady of Good Aid Cathedral Primary School.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2844">The '''Playoffs to the [[1. divisjon]]''' in [[Norway|Norwegian]] [[association football]] took place from 1996 up to and including the 2000 season.

The playoffs were instituted because of the streamlining of the First Division ahead of the 1997 season. It was reduced from two groups to one, and thus, not all winners of the [[2. divisjon]] groups could be promoted.

From the 2001 season, the 2. divisjon got four groups instead of eight, meaning that each of the four group winners was promoted.

'''Rebound exercise''' (or “Rebounding”) is a type of elastically leveraged low-impact exercise usually performed on a device known as a ''rebounder''—sometimes called a "mini-trampoline"—which is directly descended from regular sports or athletic [[trampoline]]s.

Some of the basic movements and actions of rebound exercise include bouncing in place (sometimes also called "jumping" or the Basic Bounce&lt;ref name="Basic Bounce"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://rebound.fitness/rebound_videos/basic-bounce/|title=Basic Bounce|accessdate=2018-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;), [[jumping jacks]], twists, side-to-side motions, running in place, dance movements, and a wide variety of other movements, patterned or un-patterned, with or without the use of hand-weights or other accessories. A wide variety of physical and other benefits are claimed for rebound exercise, which experienced a tremendous upsurge of interest&lt;ref name="articlesphere"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.articlesphere.com/Article/Rebounder-Trampolines/76971|title=Rebounder Trampolines &amp;#124; Trampoline|publisher=articlesphere.com|accessdate=2015-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the mid-1980s. A rebound exercise program can focus on [[aerobics]], strength, or just simple easy non-jarring movement, depending on the needs of the person bouncing.

Typically round, rebounders are much smaller (at about 3 to 4 feet in total diameter) than regular trampolines, and they are not designed for stunts. Other equipment for one or two feet, such as Kangoo Jumps or BOSU balls, can provide a type of rebound exercise experience, and regular, full-size, sports or athletic trampolines can also be used to perform the various movements, routines, programs, and styles that characterize rebound exercise. Rebounders are predominantly used solo in personal homes, but are also found in some health clubs, and physical rehabilitation centers.

== History ==

The modern trampoline was created by George Nissen in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, in 1936.&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite book|title=Gymnastics|author=Gutman, D.|date=1998|publisher=Penguin Young Readers Group|isbn=9781101160657|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=UsnUxfFEQxUC&amp;pg=PT75|accessdate=2015-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1938 the first “small trampoline” was created by Ed Russell, who left his ideas and prototype with Victor Green, who patented the “small trampoline” in 1975.&lt;ref&gt;United States Patent #3,892,403.&lt;/ref&gt;  Within a year, five American companies were manufacturing small trampolines, which were soon called rebounders.

In part because of business promotional efforts, and in part because of a number of scientific studies that seemed to support the value of rebounding (see “Scientific Studies” below), from 1981 to 1984 rebound exercise became very popular in the United States, with reportedly over one million units selling a year. The fad faded by the end of 1984, supposedly because poor quality foreign-made units had flooded the U.S. market.

Today, there appears to be an upsurge of interest in rebound exercise, in part due to increasing quality of equipment and in part due to its use in physical therapy and the fight against obesity generally. Rebound exercise is especially popular in holistic health circles, as rebounding is said to combat a number of ailments (see “Claimed Benefits” below) given its ability to generally and gently stimulate the immune system and provide aerobic exercise without jarring the physical structures of the body as the elastic element of the rebounder is said to take up to 85% of the shock that the body would otherwise experience.

== Equipment ==

Rebounders are often called “mini-trampolines,” but this is a misnomer. Trampolines are generally much larger, and are designed to perform stunts such as flips and seat drops, while it is dangerous to perform stunts on rebounders. While there are “double mini-trampolines” used in sports and even Olympic competition, these are designed specifically to perform stunts and are used in a substantially different manner than is the typical rebounder.

Most but not all rebounders are round, and consist of the following parts:

* 6 legs between 8 and 14” long
* a durable mat with an elastic nature
* an elastic element such as spring or bungee bands
* a round elevated rim which the legs support and which is attached to the mat by the elastic element, either springs or bungee bands

Since their introduction, many improvements have been made to the quality and construction of rebounders. Spring size, shape, and durability have improved greatly over time, and in the last several years springs have been replaced entirely in certain high-end units by bungee-bands, which are quieter and may also offer certain advantages in terms of smoothness and user experience. Units with folding legs, and units whose entire body (including the mat and the rim) folds in half, or even in quarters, have been introduced. Rebounders can be purchased for anywhere from between $40 and $1,000 and up.

The largest two differences between rebounders, other than manufacturing materials, relate to the source of elasticity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Best Mini Trampolines|url=http://trampolineguide.net/best-mini-trampoline-reviews/|publisher=The Greatest Equipment For Rebounding}}&lt;/ref&gt; As this mechanism is responsible for carrying the weight of the user, their longevity and responsiveness directly affect the rebounding experience. The two main mechanisms currently in production are bungee cords&lt;ref name="Bungee cord rebounders"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bellicon.com|title=Bungee cord rebounders|accessdate=2016-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; and piano wire.&lt;ref name="Piano wire rebounders"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.needak.com|title=Piano wire rebounders|accessdate=2016-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types of exercise and movements performed ==

Rebound exercise begins as soon as someone steps on a rebounder and begins to move their body. It can be highly aerobic — full-on sprints and interval training are ideal on a rebounder, because it does not jar the physical body anywhere near as much as does hard ground — or it can be very slow and gentle, with only a gentle rocking taking place.

Just as rebounders have evolved from poorly made spring-based units to modern spring-based units and high-end bungee-based units, the types of exercise and movement done on rebounders has evolved as well.

Al Carter initially introduced the distinction between the “health bounce” (a gentle rocking motion that anyone in any state of health can do, which was said to stimulate the immune system), an “aerobic bounce” that involved elevating the heart rate (either running in place or dancing), and the “strength bounce,” which involved higher bouncing with both feet leaving the mat (leading to both abdominal and lower body strength directly as well as to the strengthening of all bodily cells through the accelerative force applied (see Claimed Benefits below).

Subsequently, many different approaches have been taken to rebounding. For example, collaborating with Al Carter and working with athletes in the late 1970s and 1980s, Dr. Harry Sneider, a college athletic coach, brought his sport-specific training methods and the use of resistive hand-weights to rebound exercise.&lt;ref name="drfit"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.drfit.net/DVDS--Book--Weights.html.|title=Sneiders Family Fitness, Inc. - DVDS, Book, Weights|publisher=drfit.net|accessdate=2015-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  More recently, JB Burns has pioneered an infomercial and mass equipment approach making use of dance-style workout DVDs for home users. Along the way, a variety of celebrities have endorsed rebounding, including the fitness guru Jack LaLane and the self-help guru Tony Robbins. Bob Hope reportedly said, ““I keep my REBOUNDER at the foot of my bed, and use it daily,” and President Ronald Reagan reportedly said, “If you see somebody jumping up and down on the second floor of the White House, that's me rebounding."&lt;ref name="reboundersgov"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reboundersgov.com/?page_id=23.|title=Mini Trampoline Testimonials &amp;#124; Resistive Rebounding Experiences &amp;#124; Dakota Group, LLC|publisher=reboundersgov.com|accessdate=2015-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Claimed benefits ==

There are five main organizing themes or perspectives with respect to what is claimed&lt;ref name="Rebounder health benefits"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.needak.com/rebounder-health-benefits|title=Rebounder health benefits|accessdate=2016-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; [doubtful source: trampoline sales site] to be special about the health and fitness benefits of rebound exercise:

* '''Strengthened Cells''': All of the body’s cells are said to be strengthened through the mechanics of rebounding, either because of gravity changes or because of pressure differentials (along with more oxygen reaching cells throughout the body);
* '''Increased Lymph Flow &amp; Immune System Function''': Rebounding is said to lead to greatly increased lymph fluid circulation, leading directly to a boosted immune system, greater white blood cell activity, and increased detoxification generally;
* '''Cardiovascular and Respiratory Improvement''': Rebounding is said to directly yield impressive aerobic exercise benefits in terms of heart strength and functioning, respiration, and related physiological functions; and
* '''Physical Strength, Muscular Development, Coordination, Balance, and Flexibility''': Rebounding is often said to improve all of these.
* '''Low Impact, Less Strain on Joints, Soft Tissue, Skeleton''': The elastic element of a rebounder, either springs or bungee bands, absorbs much of the impact or shock on each bounce, thereby making rebound exercise more attractive to those who need to avoid shocking or straining their joints, soft tissue, and skeleton.

Rebounding is said to assist dozens of specific medical conditions—from arthritis to vision improvement—but there is little systematic peer-reviewed scientific evidence for these claims.

== NASA study and scientific support generally ==

The single most important and most frequently quoted scientific research study on rebounding was conducted in 1980 through NASA by A. Bhattacharya, E.P. McCutcheon, E.Shvartz, and J.E. Greenleaf; Biomechanical Research Division, NASA-Ames Research Center, Moffett Field, California, in cooperation with the Wenner-Gren Research laboratory, University of Kentucky, Lexington, Kentucky.&lt;ref&gt;Journal of Applied Physiology 49(5):  881-887, 1980. Journal of Applied Physiology 49(5):  881-887, 1980 at http://jap.physiology.org/content/49/5/881.abstract.&lt;/ref&gt;  The key findings for this study include the following:

* ".. . for similar levels of heart rate and oxygen consumption, the magnitude of the bio mechanical stimuli is greater with  jumping on a trampoline than with running, a finding that  might help identify acceleration parameters needed for  the design of remedial procedures to avert deconditioning  in persons exposed to weightlessness."
* "The external work output at equivalent levels of oxygen  uptake were significantly greater while trampolining than running. The greatest difference was about 68%.”
* "While trampolining, as long as the G-force remained below 4-G's, the ratio of oxygen consumption compared to  biomechanical conditioning was sometimes more than twice as efficient as treadmill running."
* "The G-force measured at the ankle was always more than twice the G-force measured at the back and forehead while running on a treadmill.…While jumping on a trampoline, the G-force was almost the same at all three points, (ankle, back, forehead) and well below the rupture threshold of a normal  healthy individual.”
* " ...averting the deconditioning that occurs during the immobilization of bed rest or space flight, due to a lack of gravireceptor stimulation (in addition to other factors), requires an acceleration profile that can be delivered at a relatively low metabolic cost….for equivalent metabolic cost, and acceleration profile from jumping [on a trampoline] will provide greater stimuli to gravireceptors."

A small number of other independent scientific studies have been done on rebounding, most from 1980 through 1983 at the peak of the rebounding fad.&lt;ref&gt;http://reboundworld.com/allontherebound1.1.pdf at page 217 for a summary of nine major independent scientific studies done on rebounding through 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no evidence that NASA ever stated 'Rebound exercise is "The most efficient, effective form of exercise yet devised by man."'

The club's [[Association football|football]] team is currently playing in the first division of [[Morocco|Moroccan]] championship [[Botola]]. The club finished in the 2nd place in the [[Botola 2]] in the 2011–12 season, which led to the promotion to the first division.

==History==
The club was founded in 1938 under the name of '''Association Sportive de Berkane'''. In 1953, the club was named '''Union Sportive Musulmane de Berkane'''.
In 1966 it was renamed '''Union Sportive de Berkane''' and in the same year, a new club was founded under the name of '''Chabab Riadhi de Berkane'''.

In 1971, both team merged to make Renaissance Sportive de Berkane (Nahdat Berkane). This merger was beneficial for the club, it accesses in 1st division in 1977–1978.

'''Roskilde Ring''' was a [[Motorsport#Motor racing|motor racing]] [[Race track|circuit]] in [[Roskilde]], [[Denmark]]. It hosted the [[Danish Grand Prix]] between 1960 and 1962, with non-championship [[Formula One]] races in the last two years which were won by [[Stirling Moss]] and [[Jack Brabham]].

==History==
The circuit was opened in 1955 by Businessman Paul Tholstrup as a short 670 meter track, becoming Denmark's first permanent road circuit. The layout was a banked oval, utilizing the steep sides of the old gravel pit which the circuit was built on. In 1957 the track was extended, using waste land which existed between the circuit and the rail track to the west. This created the  still relatively short 1.4 kilometer grand prix circuit. Typical for this circuit, described by Stirling Moss as "a most peculiar raceway", were the banked corners and the fact that the circuit did not have a real straight. Because the track was built in an old gravel pit it looks like an amphitheater. There was also an elevation of 14 meters (45 feet) and the track was driven anticlockwise.
[[Image:Roskilde-Ring-Park-1.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Roskilde Ring as it is today. A pond is where the paddock once stood.]]
The Roskilde Ring was located close to the center of Roskilde, with new residential developments surrounding the circuit. Due to the high number of complaints about the noise created, it was closed in 1969. After closing the site was turned into a park. A hotel has been built where the race control tower stood.&lt;ref&gt;http://forix.autosport.com/8w/roskildering.html Roskilde Ring history at forix.autosport.com&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Salisbury and South Wiltshire Sports Club''' (also known as the County Ground) is a sports ground in [[Salisbury]], Wiltshire, England, which is used for cricket and other sports.

== Cricket ==
The first recorded [[cricket]] match at the ground was in 1854, when South Wiltshire played an [[All England Eleven]]. The ground hosted its first [[Minor Counties Championship]] match when [[Wiltshire County Cricket Club|Wiltshire]] played [[Hertfordshire County Cricket Club|Hertfordshire]] in 1905. The ground next hosted Wiltshire's home matches from 1926 to 1949 and then from 1958 to the present day. The ground has also hosted a single [[MCCA Knockout Trophy]] match between Wiltshire and [[Herefordshire County Cricket Club|Herefordshire]].

The ground has also hosted [[List-A cricket|List-A]] matches.  The first List-A match played on the ground was between Wiltshire and [[Scotland national cricket team|Scotland]] in the [[2000 NatWest Trophy]].  The ground has hosted two further List-A matches involving Wiltshire: against [[Ireland national cricket team|Ireland]] in the [[2002 Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester Trophy]], and [[Kent County Cricket Club|Kent]] in the [[2005 Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester Trophy]].

In local domestic cricket, the ground is the home of [[South Wilts Cricket Club]] who play in the [[Southern Premier Cricket League]].  

== Facilities ==
The site has two cricket grounds, an artificial all-weather pitch and a full-size grass football pitch.

The first pavilion, a small one-storey building, was built at the Wilton Road ground in 1955 at a cost of £1,000 to accommodate South Wilts Cricket Club and Bemerton Athletic Football Club. This pavilion was closed in 2012, after a long-running fundraising effort for a new clubhouse was completed. The new clubhouse was built with costs rising to £1.2 million. The current clubhouse is a two-storey building that caters for hockey and football in the winter and cricket in the summer. The clubhouse also caters for all Sports Club events, which range from music events to quiz nights.

The '''Scottish football referee strike''' refers to the unprecedented [[strike action|withdrawal of services]] by top level [[Referee (association football)|referees]] in [[Football in Scotland|Scottish football]], following a dispute between the Scottish Senior Football Referees' Association and the [[Scottish Football Association]]. It affected 20 matches scheduled for the weekend of 27/28 November 2010 in the [[Scottish Premier League]], the [[Scottish Football League]], the [[Scottish Cup]], as well as the [[2010 Scottish Challenge Cup Final]]. When combined with significant weather disruption, the effect of the strike was that only four games went ahead, all in the SPL on 27 November, using replacement referees drawn from [[Israel]], [[Luxembourg]] and [[Malta]]. It was the first time since 1905 that a domestic Scottish match had been refereed by someone from outside Scotland.

The background to the dispute centres on the referee's perceptions that the SFA were not doing enough to protect them from undue criticism and questions over their integrity from football clubs, leading to increasing fears for their personal safety as controversial decisions were debated by the media and fans. After referee [[Dougie McDonald]] was found to have lied to his supervisor and [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] manager [[Neil Lennon]] after a game on 17 October 2010, the ensuing controversy and debate led to referees voting to strike on 21 November in an attempt to achieve substantial changes in the game. Immediately after the strike, McDonald opted for early retirement, to allow the ongoing dispute to focus on the issues at hand.

==Background==
As a commercially separate entity, the referees for the SPL are provided under contract from the SFA.&lt;ref name=b/&gt; Until the 2010 dispute, there had never been a referees strike before in Scottish football.&lt;ref name=p/&gt; Scottish referees are not fully professional, and instead are paid on a match fee basis, currently set at £800 and equating to a maximum expected income of £10,000 a year according to ex-referee [[Stuart Dougal]].&lt;ref name=e1/&gt;&lt;ref name=l1/&gt;

In 2008, a strike over match fees threatening the start of the [[2008–09 Scottish Premier League|2008–09 season]] was averted when the Scottish Senior Referees' Association and the SPL agreed to benchmark SPL referees pay to that of other European leagues. At the time it was acknowledged that the dispute was not only related to pay parity, but also about questions over their authority, with [[Jim Traynor]] commenting that referees saw a "need to be protected from chairman and managers who question their honesty and integrity".&lt;ref name=o/&gt;

In December 2008, after several SPL managers were rebuked by the SPL and SFA for critical comments about referees, all SPL managers signed an agreement to stop discussing refereeing decisions after matches. According to Rangers manager [[Walter Smith]], the agreement was a "show of intent from managers that there is an acceptance that there are too many headlines being grabbed by the fact that we may be a little critical of referees at times", while the then Celtic manager [[Gordon Strachan]] stated "we think we should take the pressure off referees a bit", and "Whether it works or not, I don't know, but it's worth a try".&lt;ref name=c/&gt; By the time of the 2010 strike, that experiment was described by [[BBC Scotland]] as having been short-lived, and by ''[[The Scotsman]]'' as having been gradually undermined.&lt;ref name=b/&gt;&lt;ref name=p/&gt;

==Penalty incident and aftermath==
Refereeing in Scotland came under intense media attention in 2010 after a controversial incident on 17 October, during an SPL game between [[Dundee United F.C.|Dundee United]] and [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]], which Celtic won 2–1.&lt;ref name=p/&gt; When the score was level at 1–1, referee [[Dougie McDonald]] awarded a [[Penalty kick (association football)|penalty kick]] to Celtic. He then quickly reversed his initial decision after consulting with assistant referee Steven Craven.&lt;ref name=k/&gt;&lt;ref name=l/&gt; Celtic officials heavily criticised the decision to not award a penalty after the game.&lt;ref name=k/&gt;&lt;ref name=l/&gt; After Craven resigned on 25 October, it emerged that he and McDonald had lied to his supervisor, Jim McBurney, and to Celtic manager [[Neil Lennon]] about the decision making process. McDonald had claimed that he had changed his mind after consulting with Craven, when in fact he had changed his mind himself before consulting Craven. This revelation prompted an investigation by the SFA, which resulted in McDonald receiving an official warning on 29 October, while also upholding the actual decision.

Both before and after the warning was given, however, there were calls for McDonald to resign. There was also disagreement over the actual version of events between Craven, McDonald, and SFA Head of Referee Development [[Hugh Dallas]].&lt;ref name=p/&gt;&lt;ref name=h/&gt;&lt;ref name=i/&gt;&lt;ref name=j/&gt;&lt;ref name=m/&gt;&lt;ref name=n/&gt; While resisting calls for an independent inquiry into the McDonald incident, SFA chief executive [[Stewart Regan]] launched an inquiry to review how referees are disciplined, suggesting the current method of examination by a panel of mostly former referees was improper.&lt;ref name=e/&gt; According to ''The Telegraph'' recounting the McDonald incident on the eve of the strike, "the rules do not permit McDonald to be sacked", and having declined to resign as the newspaper alleged some at the SFA felt he should, he subsequently returned to the referees roster.&lt;ref name=k1/&gt; On 28 November, the day after Scottish referees went on strike, McDonald retired.&lt;ref name = "retired"&gt;{{cite news

Following the SPL [[Old Firm]] game of 24 October, Celtic twice wrote to the SFA to question the decisions made by referee [[William Collum (referee)|William Collum]], who also received death threats. Denying he was stoking up tension around refereeing decisions, Neil Lennon condemned the threats.&lt;ref name=q/&gt; He also claimed that the media reaction to his club's recent questioning of referees as having been blown out of proportion, and that their actions were not out of the ordinary compared to other clubs.&lt;ref name=q/&gt; On 3 November Celtic striker [[Gary Hooper]] claimed referees wanted to give decisions against his team.&lt;ref name=d/&gt; Lennon then received a two match touchline ban after heavily criticising decisions by referee [[Craig Thomson (referee)|Craig Thomson]] and his team during a 2–0 away defeat to [[Heart of Midlothian F.C.|Hearts]] on 10 November.&lt;ref name=s/&gt;&lt;ref name=u/&gt; Lennon stated after the game "I'll seek clarification, but they'll probably have their story ready" and "Craig Thomson's supposed to be one of the best in the country. It doesn't say a lot for the rest if that's the case."&lt;ref name=s/&gt;&lt;ref name=u/&gt;

On 30 October, the SFA chief executive [[Stewart Regan]], describing how his first month in the role had been dominated by the issue of refereeing, announced plans to launch a ''Respect'' campaign early in 2011.&lt;ref name=t/&gt; Regan commented that "This whole handling of referees by managers, players and clubs has got to stop".&lt;ref name=t/&gt; On the same day, Hearts released a statement calling for refereeing standards to go up significantly, post match statements from officials explaining decisions.&lt;ref name=z/&gt; The statement also suggested that lower standards could be a "cover for bias and match fixing".&lt;ref name=z/&gt;

On 16 November, [[Pete Wishart]], a spokesman for the [[Scottish National Party]] on sport, stated that all referees in Scotland should be required to declare which team they support, claiming that while he did not doubt their fairness, such a declaration was in keeping with the general rise in the [[freedom of information]] culture.&lt;ref name=f/&gt; Two days later, the Celtic chairman [[John Reid, Baron Reid of Cardowan|John Reid]], addressing Celtic's [[annual general meeting]], stated that referee McDonald's position was now completely untenable and called for his resignation. He also stated that Wishart's proposal should be considered as part of the bold and radical action the SFA needed to take to restore their integrity in the wake of the controversy.&lt;ref name=g/&gt; On 21 November the ''[[Sunday Mail (Scotland)|Sunday Mail]]'' published a story claiming that 80 percent of Category One officials had failed a 30-question written exam on the [[Laws of the Game (association football)|Laws of the Game]], conducted at a Spanish winter training camp in February, and alleged Hugh Dallas had been "taken aback" by the results and had instituted remedial action.&lt;ref name=k1/&gt;

==Strike action==
During a meeting in the afternoon of Sunday, 21 November, the Category One referees voted to strike over the crisis.&lt;ref name=b/&gt; Media reports suggested all 31 of the 33 Category One referees present at the meeting voted for the strike, supported by all 10 Category Two officials also present.&lt;ref name=p/&gt;&lt;ref name=y/&gt; The meeting had followed a regular monthly SFA organised meeting, after which the referees asked to carry on using the room for a meeting of the Scottish Senior Football Referees Association.&lt;ref name=j1/&gt;

Based on the fact that Category Three officials represented by both the SRFA and the Scottish Association of Referees (SAR) had not been represented at the strike meeting, the SSFRA informed them on 23 November that as far as they were concerned, they were at liberty to choose whether or not they accepted appointments for the weekend.&lt;ref name=STVFourthOfficials/&gt;

Former Scottish referee [[Kenny Clark (referee)|Kenny Clark]] said that the reason for the strike was that referees were at "the end of their tether" over the effect criticism of their decisions was having on themselves, their families, and their professional lives. He cited instances of hate email being sent to the workplaces of referees. Fearing rising tension would lead to attacks, according to Clark, the strike was intended to "put down a marker", and that the comments from Reid had "put the tin lid on it" in the strike meeting.&lt;ref name=b/&gt; Another former Scottish referee [[Stuart Dougal]] said he believed that the SFA had not "been strong enough to come out in defence of referees" since the McDonald incident, and that while referees accepted criticism, "When there is innuendo, and questioning the referee's integrity, that's when it becomes unacceptable".&lt;ref name=l1/&gt;&lt;ref name=y/&gt; According to ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', the ''[[Sunday Mail (Scotland)|Sunday Mail]]'' story published in the morning the strike meeting was called "was regarded by many at [the strike] meeting as the last straw".&lt;ref name=k1/&gt;&lt;ref name=j1/&gt;

The referees stated that the strike would go ahead irrespective of the outcome of talks conducted in the intervening week, but that referees would return to officiating after the weekend action. The consequent negotiations, which were described by the referees as constructive, included the offer from the SFA of a ban on all immediate comment from managers on referees before and after games, and stricter sanctions for those who question referees integrity. The referees also sought written assurances from the chairmen of all 42 senior clubs that they respected referees integrity. After a second meeting on Wednesday 24 November, at midnight the referees reaffirmed the strike would be going ahead, as the action was not intended to be a "bargaining chip" to produce "quick fixes or deals".&lt;ref name=v/&gt; The SFA had set a deadline of Thursday for talks to succeed and the strike to be called off, after which they would be forced to implement contingency plans of seeking foreign, replacement officials.&lt;ref name=f1/&gt;

Referee spokesman John McKendrick described how the strike was intended to affect root and branch change in Scottish football, and act as both a statement of intent and an opportunity for reflection, stating "The time for talking about practical steps to improve Scottish refereeing should start from Monday". He expressed doubt that had the strike not gone ahead, the same "desire for change" which had manifested in the SFA's announcements after the strike was called, would have occurred.&lt;ref name=x/&gt;

==Reaction==
According to [[BBC Scotland]], Celtic welcomed the strike, on the basis that it would prompt a [[UEFA]] (Union of European Football Associations) investigation into refereeing standards.&lt;ref name=b/&gt; UEFA however quickly stated they would not be intervening in the dispute, describing it as a "purely domestic matter" for the SFA to resolve.&lt;ref name=y/&gt;

According to ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' writing after the strike announcement, while "Celtic have remained at the centre of controversy", and excepting the statement from Hearts on 30 October, it stated that "other clubs and managers have refrained from any form of criticism [running up to the decision to strike] in a bid to ease the pressure".&lt;ref name=y/&gt; Denying that the recent disputes with Celtic were the sole factor behind the decision to strike, on the eve of the strike SFA chief executive Stewart Regan said "This is an issue across Scottish football as far as the refs are concerned. They mentioned incidents and individuals across the SPL and SFL".&lt;ref name=e1/&gt;

[[Motherwell F.C.|Motherwell]] manager [[Craig Brown (footballer born 1940)|Craig Brown]] stated the strike was a "radical course of action, a step too far", and complained that the action would unfairly affect his club with loss of [[Football on British TV|broadcast rights revenues]] if their SPL match at home against Hearts was affected.&lt;ref name=b/&gt; [[Kilmarnock F.C.|Kilmarnock]] manager [[Mixu Paatelainen]] described the planned strike as "disappointing" but stated that "there has been too much talk of referees and I don't think that's healthy", claiming it could affect referees performances.&lt;ref name=b/&gt; The recently appointed manager of [[Hibernian F.C.|Hibernian]], [[Colin Calderwood]], was supportive of the strike, but insisted managers had the right to voice their opinions, detailing how there had been concerns in every match he been in charge of up to the strike, and suggested guidelines could be issued to managers on appropriate commentary of referees by managers.&lt;ref name=r/&gt; While generally supportive and understanding of the referees position, [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]] manager [[Walter Smith]] criticised the broad nature of their criticism, and their desire for every club to state they would not question referees integrity. Claiming that his club had never questioned referees integrity, he called on the referees to specifically name the people they believe were questioning their integrity.&lt;ref name=b1/&gt;

As the talks to avert the strike ended, the chief executive of the SPL [[Neil Doncaster]] said of the strike that they were "sympathetic towards referees and the criticism they have received in recent weeks, but the way to address concerns is through dialogue, not to walk away from the situation".&lt;ref name=v/&gt; David Longmuir, chief executive of the SFL, reiterated that they had admiration and support for referees, but that "as a result of the action, many of our clubs and supporters will feel let down".&lt;ref name=v/&gt; [[Fraser Wishart]], chief executive of the [[Professional Footballers' Association Scotland]], stated he could not 100% support the strike, feeling aggrieved at the fact the discussions between the SFA and the referees in the intervening week between announcement and strike, had been done 'behind closed doors', and would likely "bring in tougher regulations that will see our members being hammered".&lt;ref name=x/&gt;

It was initially advised on Thursday that 11 of the 20 scheduled games would proceed, including all SPL games, with all but one [[Scottish Football League]] match postponed.&lt;ref name=w/&gt; [[Scottish Football League First Division|First Division]] clubs [[Cowdenbeath F.C.|Cowdenbeath]] and [[Stirling Albion F.C.|Stirling Albion]], who were among the clubs affected, stated that they would seek compensation from the SFA for the financial affects of rescheduling, citing the example of the cost of having already printed programmes for the games and of staffing commitments.&lt;ref name=w/&gt;

The SNP Leader and First Minister of Scotland [[Alex Salmond]], Scottish Labour Party Sport spokesperson [[Bill Butler (politician)|Bill Butler]], and Leader of the Scottish Liberal Democrats [[Tavish Scott]], all expressed their hope that the strike could be avoided through discussion between the referees and the SFA.&lt;ref name=d1/&gt;

[[Grahame Smith]], General Secretary of the [[Scottish Trades Union Congress]] supported the strike, describing any referee who officiated as a replacement, as a "[[Strikebreaker|scab]]".&lt;ref name=d1/&gt; The SFA chief executive Stewart Regan denied the replacements were scabs, stating "[the Scottish referees] are not a union. They are an association. They operate for the good of Scottish football, they are not employed by the SFA. They get a match fee. No-one is breaking union rules." Regan stated all replacement officials were all experienced referees at the highest level and had been approved by the SFA's Referee Committee, explaining that they were all either "[[FIFA|Fifa]] listed or Grade One officials in their own countries."&lt;ref name=e1/&gt;

==Replacement officials==
In order to ensure fixtures would go ahead, the SFA approached "in excess" of 25 nations within UEFA for replacement officials. After being refused help by the associations in [[Netherlands]], [[Iceland]] and [[Norway]], and also having believed to have been declined help by those in [[Belgium]], [[Estonia]], [[Northern Ireland]], the [[Republic of Ireland]], [[Sweden]] and [[Wales]], by 25 November, the SFA stated it had secured officials for 11 of the 20 fixtures originally scheduled for the affected weekend.&lt;ref name=e1/&gt;&lt;ref name=v/&gt; The 44 officials being drafted in to allow the 11 games to go ahead were believed to be from [[Malta]], [[Israel]], [[Poland]], [[Portugal]] and [[Luxembourg]], at a cost of around £40,000.&lt;ref name=e1/&gt;&lt;ref name=v/&gt; According to ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', the English [[Premier League]] had insufficient numbers of free officials to be able to help.&lt;ref name=y/&gt;

The 11 fixtures that were to go ahead as scheduled using replacement officials, comprised the full [[2010–11 Scottish Premier League|Scottish Premier League]] programme (4 games on Saturday, 2 on Sunday), three Saturday [[2010–11 Scottish Cup|Scottish Cup]] third round replays, the Sunday [[2010 Scottish Challenge Cup Final]], and one [[2010–11 Scottish First Division|First Division]] game (drawn by lots). The nine games which would not go ahead were the remaining [[2010–11 Scottish First Division|First Division]] fixtures (3 games), and all the games in the [[2010–11 Scottish Second Division|Second Division]] (2 games), and [[2010–11 Scottish Third Division|Third Division]] (4 games), all scheduled for the Saturday.&lt;ref name=v/&gt;&lt;ref name=w/&gt;

In light of the free choice stance of the SRFA at the strike meeting on the involvement of Category Three Scottish referees, three of them were lined up to act as the [[fourth official]]s in three SPL games alongside the foreign officials.&lt;ref name=STVFourthOfficials/&gt;

On 26 November, the Polish FA reversed their decision to send three sets of officials, stating they were now required for games in Poland, followed by the Portuguese FA, who had sent teams of officials to cover the two Sunday SPL games, only to board a return flight as soon as they arrived at Glasgow Airport. The withdrawals led to the last remaining Division One game being called off, and two of three Scottish Cup replays also being called off, and cast doubt over cover for the remaining fixtures.&lt;ref name=v/&gt;&lt;ref name=h1/&gt; Scottish broadcaster [[STV (TV network)|STV]] claimed the Polish referees pulled out after they realised they were providing cover for striking referees, having initially believed they were participating in an exchange programme.&lt;ref name=c1/&gt; On the eve of the strike, the Israeli FA stated it might not have sent referees had it been given the full story behind the request by the SFA, while the Luxembourg FA stated they had not been given the reasons behind the SFA's request, but that they had been following the dispute on the internet.&lt;ref name=g1/&gt;

The SFA published the names of the referees appointed for the weekend fixtures on Friday 26 November, showing that the matches would be refereed by officials from Malta, Israel, Portugal and Luxembourg.&lt;ref name=i1/&gt; These appointments were thrown into confusion, however, when the Portuguese officials returned home soon after arriving at [[Glasgow Airport]].&lt;ref name=v/&gt; The Portuguese referees had been due to officiate the matches at [[Hibernian F.C.|Hibernian]] on Saturday and [[Motherwell F.C.|Motherwell]] on Sunday.&lt;ref name = "maltese and israelis"/&gt;

Adverse weather conditions also affected the scheduled matches.&lt;ref name = "cup weather"/&gt; Two of the Scottish Cup replays failed a Friday pitch inspection after the time of the Polish withdrawal,&lt;ref name = "cup weather"/&gt; with the last one called off on Saturday morning due to overnight snow.&lt;ref name = "cup weather"/&gt; The latter postponement opened a possibility for the SFA to plug the gap caused by the departure of the Portuguese officials.&lt;ref name = "maltese and israelis"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "cup weather"/&gt; The Maltese officials were reassigned to cover the match between Hibernian and [[St Johnstone F.C.|St Johnstone]].&lt;ref name = "maltese and israelis"/&gt;&lt;ref name=SFAList/&gt; A set of Israeli officials were given the scheduled match between Motherwell and [[Heart of Midlothian F.C.|Hearts]],&lt;ref name = "maltese and israelis"/&gt;&lt;ref name=SFAList/&gt; which was postponed on Sunday morning due to deteriorating weather conditions.&lt;ref&gt;

One of the Israeli officials, Eli Hacmon, commented after refereeing the match between [[Kilmarnock F.C.|Kilmarnock]] and [[Aberdeen F.C.|Aberdeen]] that no-one had explained to him why the referees were on strike before he travelled to Scotland.&lt;ref name = "hacmon"/&gt; He went on to say that he would not have provided his services if he had known that the Scottish referees had gone on strike due to criticism.&lt;ref name = "hacmon"&gt;{{cite news

With both Sunday SPL games postponed due to the weather, only four of the scheduled 20 games in the weekend programme went ahead. The four results were Celtic 2–2 Inverness, Hamilton 0–0 St Mirren, Hibernian 0–0 St Johnstone and Kilmarnock 2–0 Aberdeen, with officials from Malta, Luxembourg and Israel in control, as well as two Scottish fourth officials.&lt;ref name=CelticResult/&gt;&lt;ref name=KilmarnockResult/&gt;&lt;ref name=HamiltonResult/&gt;&lt;ref name=HibernianResult/&gt; According to the ''[[Scotland On Sunday]]'', the games controlled by the replacement officials was the first instance of a referee from outside Scotland refereeing a Scottish domestic match since 1905, when an English referee had been invited to officiate a league championship deciding match between the Old Firm rivals of Celtic and Rangers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://scotlandonsunday.scotsman.com/refereeing-controversies/1905-The-last-time-Scotland.6642346.jp

==Aftermath==
SFA chief executive Stewart Regan stated his confidence on 28 November that the referees would return to work the following weekend, as he believed that the intention of the referees was to only withdraw service for one weekend of matches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/scotland/9235676.stm|title=Scottish Football Association says referee strike over|publisher=BBC Sport|date=28 November 2010|accessdate=28 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regan also denied that the foreign officials had been misled by the SFA as to why they had been recruited.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sport.scotsman.com/sport/SFA-chief-denies-foreign-referees.6644078.jp|title=SFA chief denies foreign referees were misled into breaking strike|work=[[The Scotsman]]|last=Wright|first=Angus|date=30 November 2010|accessdate=30 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "regan adamant"/&gt; The ''[[Daily Record (Scotland)|Daily Record]]'' newspaper obtained a copy of the letter sent by the SFA to foreign associations requesting assistance, but found inconsistencies between the letter and what foreign officials believed to be the case.&lt;ref name = "regan adamant"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/football/spl/2010/11/30/ref-crisis-regan-admant-he-did-not-mislead-foreign-refs-to-break-strike-86908-22751303/|title=Ref Crisis: Regan adamant he did not mislead foreign refs to break strike|last=Jackson|first=Keith|work=[[Daily Record (Scotland)|Daily Record]]|date=30 November 2010|accessdate=30 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Referee Dougie McDonald announced his early retirement with immediate effect after the strike weekend, in order to remove the issue of his disputed actions which in part led to the strike, from the ongoing debate about referees treatment.&lt;ref name=BBCMcDonaldRetires/&gt; A statement from the referees after the strike said, "Dougie retiring caps a sad time for Scottish refereeing. We hope the right people can sit down with referees and play a full part in delivering the real changes required." adding that they hoped the strike had "allowed everyone connected with Scottish football to have the period of reflection we felt was needed".&lt;ref name=BBCRefsSeekTalks/&gt; Although [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] made no official comment, [[Paul McBride]], a [[Queen's Counsel|QC]] closely linked to the Celtic [[board of directors]], commented that the club felt vindicated by the departures of Dallas and McDonald.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/scot_prem/9240281.stm|title=Celtic feel 'vindicated' by ref Dougie McDonald's exit|publisher=BBC Sport|last=Lamont|first=Alasdair|date=29 November 2010|accessdate=29 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Stirling Albion F.C.|Stirling Albion]] director Paul Goodwin stated on 30 November that he expected the SFL to pursue the SFA for compensation on behalf of the SFL clubs that had matches postponed due to the strike.&lt;ref name = "compo"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/scot_div_1/9244986.stm |title=SFL clubs press for referee strike compensation |publisher=BBC Sport|date=30 November 2010|accessdate=30 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Goodwin estimated that his club had lost around £10,000 due to the postponement of their match against [[Partick Thistle F.C.|Partick Thistle]].&lt;ref name = "compo"/&gt;

'''Sledding''', '''sledging''' or '''sleighing''' is a worldwide winter activity, generally carried out in a prone or seated position on a [[vehicle]] generically known as a [[sled]] (North American), a sledge (British), or a sleigh. It is the basis of three Olympic sports: [[luge]], [[Skeleton (sport)|skeleton]] and [[bobsled]]ding. When practised on [[sand]], it is known as a form of [[sandboarding]].
[[File:Sledding in Poland Kulig Podkowa Lesna, 2010.webm|thumb|right|Sledding in [[Poland]], [[Podkowa Leśna]], Feb., 2010]]
==History==
[[Image:Wooden sled.jpg|thumb|220px|left|Old-fashioned wooden sled (or [[Toboggan]] without runners)]]

The practical use of sleds is ancient and widespread. They were developed in areas with consistent winter snow cover, as vehicles to transport materials and/or people, far more efficiently than wheeled vehicles could in icy and snowy conditions. Early designs included hand-pulled sizes as well as larger dog, horse, or ox drawn versions. Early examples of sleds and sledges were found in the [[Oseberg ship|Oseberg Viking ship excavation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Oseberg finds|url=https://www.khm.uio.no/english/visit-us/viking-ship-museum/exhibitions/oseberg/|publisher=www.khm.uio.no/|accessdate=November 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Toboggan]] [[sled]] is also a traditional form of transport used by the [[Innu]] and [[Cree]] of northern Canada and the people of Ancient Egypt are thought to have used sledges (on the desert sand and on ramps) extensively for construction.

The generic term sledding refers to traveling down a snowy hill using a sled such as a [[Flexible Flyer]] with wooden slats and metal runners.It is usually done during the winter when there is snow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hörnerschlitten|url=http://www.hoernerrodel.de/shop/hornerschlitten-110-cm-modell-lattensitz/|publisher=www.hoernerrodel.de|accessdate=19 May 2013|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; Flat plastic or aluminum discs and improvised sleds (carrier bags, baking trays, cafeteria trays, sheets of cardboard, etc.) may also be used. The activity has been known to exist as a fringe recreational activity far into the distant murky past in toboggan-type sleds which seasonally supplant the ubiquitous [[cart]].

==Back country sledding==
[[File:Mad River Rocket Stinger Black.jpg|thumb|left|A backcountry sled (a kid's size Mad River Rocket - Stinger)]]
In contrast to the more common forms of sledding, back country sledding involves four important elements in combination: a great amount of directional control, flotation, a binding system, and padding. First, back country sleds are made of strong plastic material, with the snow-side surface possessing various grooves and chines for directional control. Second, the plastic construction, with a large amount of snow-side surface area keeps the sled afloat in deeper snow conditions (the same principle behind wider powder skis or snowboards). Though the original runner sleds possessed directional control, their thin runner blades bogged down in anything but icy or thin snow conditions. Disk sleds, on the other hand, possessed flotation but no directional control. Third, modern back country sleds have a binding system, which usually consists of a simple belt strap that attaches to the sides of the sled. With the sledder in the kneeling position, the strap may go over the sledder's thighs or calves before connecting with the strap from the other side of the sled with some sort of buckling device. Finally, back country sleds have foam pads glued for the sledder to kneel on for shock absorption. One such sled is the [[Mad River Rocket]].

Back country sledding is a closer kin to back country alpine skiing or snowboarding than to traditional "pile the family in the van and go to the local hill" type of sledding. The terrain for back country sledding includes powder-filled steeps, open mountain bowls, cliff-filled ridges, and basically anywhere that one finds the powder, steeps, rocks and trees. Back country sleds, with the binding system and padding, may also be used for freestyle moves such as spins and flips off jumps and rail slides. Though similarities exist between back country sledding and alpine skiing/snowboarding, important differences separate the disciplines. From a technical perspective, the lack of a metal edge and the lower center of gravity make it more difficult to control a back country sled on icy or packed snow surfaces. From an access perspective, alpine resorts do not allow sledding on the actual mountain, except for the occasional small tubing hill.

==Recreational sledging techniques==
[[File:Zentralbibliothek Zürich - Schlittelsport in den Alpen - 000012146.jpg|thumb|left|Schlitteln, Schweizer Alpen, ~1890-1910]]
The first ride down a hill on a [[sled]] is the most important, but most also the most difficult, as it determines the path of the sled for further runs down the [[hill]]. It is essential to steer the sled along the most exciting course, perhaps adding twists and turns to make the run down the hill faster or more exciting. Other techniques to improve the ride include turning around, lying on the stomach, or closing both eyes.  Running up to a sled and jumping onto it can create additional momentum and improve ride speed.  This technique can be referred to as "Flopping."

There are five types of sleds commonly used today: runner sleds, [[toboggan]]s, disks, [[inner tube|tubes]] and backcountry sleds.  Each type has advantages and disadvantages if one is trying to get the most out of a given [[slope]].

With each course down the hill, the sled's path through the snow can become more icy.  Sleds with a greater surface area (anything but runner sleds) are able to make the first runs a great deal easier than the variety of sleds with metal runners.  Runner sleds are typically faster once the snow has compacted or turned icy.  In the 1880s, [[Samuel Leeds Allen]] invented the first steerable runner sled, the [[Flexible Flyer]].  Since that date, the ability to steer the sled away from obstacles has led people to believe it to be more appropriate choice for the safety conscious. On the other hand, the hard wood or metal front section of steerable runner sleds is far more likely to cause serious injury if it strikes a person, or if the hands are caught between the steering mechanism and a solid object in a crash. Each year, around 30,000 children in the US are injured in sledding, with one in 25 injuries requiring hospitalization. In a majority of these serious cases, young children are riding runner sleds in a prone position, and suffer hand and finger injuries when they are caught under the runners or between the sled and another object.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bjcbehavioralhealth.org/behavioralhealth_print.aspx?id=2068 BJC Health Care - The Ups and Downs of Sledding Safety]&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, runner sleds force the weight of the rider onto two thin runners where the pressure causes a microscopic film of snow or ice to melt as the sled passes over it.  This invisible layer of fluid reduces friction, causing the sled's speed to greatly exceed that of its flat bottomed relatives.

With the control of a backcountry sled, stunts become possible. Sledding off cliffs and doing tricks off jumps is known as [[extreme sledding]].

==Competitive sledding==

[[Image:Engineering skeleton sled.jpg|thumb|220px|right|Building a high tech modern [[Skeleton (sport)|Skeleton]] sled for Olympic grade racing.]]
[[Sweden]] and [[Norway]] recorded some early Kicksled Races during the 15th century.&lt;ref name="usaluge1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://usaluge.org/aboutluge/history.php/ |title=United States Luge Association |publisher=Usaluge.org |date= |accessdate=November 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Norwegian kicksled history|url=http://blogs.transparent.com/norwegian/norwegian-kicksled-history/|publisher=Norwegian Language Blog|accessdate=November 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The modern sport of sledding ([[Luge]] - [[Skeleton (sport)|Skeleton]] and [[Bobsleigh|Bobsledding]]) originated in [[St. Moritz]], [[Switzerland]] in the mid-to-late 19th century when vacationing guests adapted delivery sleds for recreational purposes and from there, it quickly spread to [[Davos]] and other Swiss towns and villages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Brief History of Snow Sledding in Europe|url=http://www.alpinesleds.com/sledding-history.html|publisher=www.alpinesleds.com|accessdate=12 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern competitive sledding started in 1883 in Davos, Switzerland. An Australian student named George Robertson won what is reputed to be the world’s first international sled race. He outraced 19 other competitors from England, Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden, Switzerland and the United States on a four kilometre stretch of road from St. Wolfgang to the town of Klosters.&lt;ref name="The first luge competition"&gt;[[International Luge Federation#History]]&lt;/ref&gt; Soon the Bobsleigh, Luge, and Skeleton were developed in succession. By mid-decade, [[Kulm Hotel]] owner [[Caspar Badrutt]] had the first run or course purpose built for the fledgling sport. The opening of formal competition for Luge was in 1883 and for Bobsleds in 1884 at St. Moritz. in 1926, the [[International Olympic Committee]] declared bobsleigh and skeleton as Olympic sports and adopted the rules of the St. Moritz run as the officially recognized Olympic rules.&lt;ref name="FIBT"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fibt.com/ |title=Federation Internationale de Bobsleigh et de Tobogganing |accessdate=2007-07-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was not until 2002, however, that skeleton itself was added permanently to the Olympic program with the [[2002 Winter Olympics]] in [[Salt Lake City, Utah]].

There are three Olympic sledding competitions. Bobsled:  Men's two and four-crew, Women's 2 crew. Luge: Men's singles, Men's doubles, Women's singles (Team Relay - Olympic discipline starting in 2014). Skeleton: Men's singles, Women's singles

A '''split season''' is a schedule format implemented in a variety of sports leagues. The season is divided into two parts, with the winners of both halves playing each other at the end for the overall championship.

Split seasons are usually found in sports with longer seasons, such as [[baseball]], [[basketball]], and [[association football|soccer]]. They are common in scholastic sports, specifically basketball, in the United States. A number of [[Minor League Baseball]] leagues also use split seasons. In Latin America, some soccer leagues use a similar format known as [[Apertura and Clausura]].

==Baseball==

===Major League Baseball===
[[Major League Baseball]] has used split seasons twice in its history. 

====1892====
In [[1892 in baseball|1892]], the [[National League]] decided to split its season in an attempt to increase interest, following the collapse of the rival [[American Association (19th century)|American Association]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sabr.org/gamesproj/game/october-1892-split-season-playoff |title=October 1892: The Split-Season Playoff |author=Terry Gottschall |website=[[Society for American Baseball Research]] |access-date=July 4, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[1892 Boston Beaneaters season|Boston Beaneaters]] won the first half of the season, while the [[1892 Cleveland Spiders season|Cleveland Spiders]] took the second half. Boston defeated Cleveland 5 games to 0, with one tie, in the championship series.

====1981====
In [[1981 Major League Baseball season|1981]], the Major League season was interrupted by a [[1981 Major League Baseball strike|players' strike]]. Due to the two-month strike, the owners tried to create an equitable solution. So on August 6, the owners decided to split the 1981 season into two halves, with the first-place teams from each half in each division (or a [[Major League Baseball wild card|wild card]] team if the same club won both halves) meeting in a best-of-five divisional playoff series. The four survivors would then move on to the two best-of-five [[League Championship Series]]. The extra round of postseason playoffs were won by the Yankees, Athletics, Expos, and Dodgers.

===Minor leagues===
In [[Minor League Baseball]], split seasons are used by two of the three [[Double-A (baseball)|Class AA]] leagues, the [[Southern League (baseball)|Southern League]] and the [[Texas League]], as well as all [[Minor League Baseball#Class A-Advanced|Class A-Advanced]] leagues ([[California League|California]], [[Carolina League|Carolina]], and [[Florida State League|Florida State]]) and full-season [[Minor League Baseball#Class A|Class A]] leagues ([[Midwest League|Midwest]] and [[South Atlantic League|South Atlantic]]). Among the [[independent baseball league|independent]] minor leagues, the [[Atlantic League of Professional Baseball|Atlantic League]] and [[Pacific Association]] use a split schedule.

If a team should win both halves of a season, most leagues provide that this team would play the team with the second-best overall record. In the past, some leagues stated that a double winner would automatically be declared champion, or automatically advance to the next round of playoffs.

One reason given for the use of split seasons in the minors is that the purpose of these leagues is different than that of Major League Baseball. These leagues are primarily for the development of players, and as such players may move from level to level at any time during the season. A team with many very good players in the early part of the season may see them promoted, leaving lesser players remaining for the end. It also allows teams who played poorly in the first half to continue to play meaningful games later in the season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.milb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20060825&amp;content_id=123881&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;vkey=news_milb |title=A tale of two seasons: Leagues with split campaigns keep players, fans involved |author=Lisa Winston |date=August 25, 2006 |website=[[Minor League Baseball]] |access-date=July 4, 2016 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Soccer==
{{Main|Apertura and Clausura}}
The Apertura and Clausura tournaments are a relatively recent innovation for many [[Latin America]]n soccer leagues in which the traditional season from August to May is divided in two sections per season, each with its own champion. ''Apertura'' and ''Clausura'' are the Spanish words for "opening" and "closing".  In French-speaking [[Ligue Haïtienne|Haiti]], these are known as the ''Ouverture'' and the ''Fermeture'', while in English-speaking [[Premier League of Belize|Belize]], they are respectively the "Opening" and "Closing" seasons. The [[North American Soccer League]] (NASL), a second-level league in the United States and Canada, adopted a split season in [[2013 North American Soccer League season|2013]]; the season is divided into a "Spring Championship" and "Fall Championship".

==Basketball==
In its only complete season, the [[American Basketball League (1961–63)|American Basketball League]] conducted a split season. The champions of East and West divisions in the first half met for a three-game playoff series in January 1962, won by the [[Kansas City Steers]]. After that series, the second half of the season began. The second half playoffs were more complicated, featuring a six-team tournament, won by the [[Cleveland Pipers]]. Once that was concluded, Cleveland defeated Kansas City for the overall championship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.apbr.org/ablhist.html |title=History of the American Basketball League |website=[[Association for Professional Basketball Research]] |access-date=July 4, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==American football==
The [[World Football League]], for its [[1975 World Football League season|1975 season]], planned on using the split season to determine the two teams that would play in [[World Bowl (WFL)|World Bowl 2]] that year, with the 18-game regular season divided into two nine-game segments. The [[Memphis Southmen]] won the first half of the regular season; the second half was never completed, and the league would fold two weeks after the 1975 season midpoint.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wflfootball.tripod.com/1975/poformat.html |title=1975 World Football League playoff format |website=wflfootball.tripod.com |access-date=May 30, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Stadion Kantrida''' is a [[association football|football]] [[stadium]] in the [[Croatia]]n city of [[Rijeka]]. It is named after the Kantrida neighbourhood in which it is located, in the western part of the city. It has served as home of the football club [[HNK Rijeka]] for most years since 1946. The stadium has a distinctive appearance as it is situated between steep cliffs, a remnant of an old quarry, just north of the stadium and the shore of the [[Adriatic Sea|Adriatic]] on its south side.&lt;ref name="noglekkant"/&gt;

Since 1990 the venue was occasionally used for [[Croatia national football team]]'s international fixtures. The national team has never been defeated at Kantrida. The stadium has a [[seating capacity]] of approximately 10,600.&lt;ref name="rijekasport"/&gt; The stadium is scheduled for major reconstruction over the next several years. A new state-of-the-art 14,438 capacity all-seater stadium will be built at the same location.

==History==
The location was used as a stone [[quarry]] before the first football ground was created on the site in 1911 by '''HŠK Victoria''', a football club based in [[Sušak, Rijeka|Sušak]] (presently part of Rijeka; but at the time a separate town east of the city),&lt;ref name="noglekkant"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nogomet.lzmk.hr/clanak.aspx?id=1365|title=Kantrida|work=Nogometni leksikon|publisher=[[Miroslav Krleža Lexicographical Institute]]|language=Croatian|accessdate=18 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the first football match played at Kantrida was held in 1913, a friendly between Victoria and [[Građanski Zagreb]].&lt;ref name="noglekkant"/&gt;

Victoria continued to use the stadium until the end of [[World War I]] and the collapse of [[Austria-Hungary]] in 1918. The city of Rijeka was then first declared part of the [[Italian Regency of Carnaro]] (1919–1920), then the [[Free State of Fiume]] (1920–1924), before being formally annexed by [[Kingdom of Italy (1861–1946)|Kingdom of Italy]] in 1924, which remained unchanged until the end of [[World War II]]. During this period between 1919 and 1945 Victoria's home town of Sušak was located on the other side of the border as it was incorporated into the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]], so the club was unable to use the ground.&lt;ref name="noglekvic"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nogomet.lzmk.hr/clanak.aspx?id=2616|title=Victoria, nogometni klub|work=Nogometni leksikon|publisher=[[Miroslav Krleža Lexicographical Institute]]|language=Croatian|accessdate=18 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1925, the 8,000 capacity stands were built by the newly established local Italian club '''[[U.S. Fiumana]]''' who went on to use the stadium between 1926 and 1945 while competing in the Italian league system.&lt;ref name="noglekkant"/&gt;&lt;ref name="noglekfiu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nogomet.lzmk.hr/clanak.aspx?id=799|title=Fiumana|work=Nogometni leksikon|publisher=[[Miroslav Krleža Lexicographical Institute]]|language=Croatian|accessdate=18 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stadium was at the time known as ''Stadio Comunale del Littorio'', but was also commonly referred to as ''Borgomarina'', as this was the Italian name for the neighbourhood.

After World War II the city of Rijeka and its surrounding area became part of [[SFR Yugoslavia]] and both Fiumana and Victoria were dissolved in 1945.&lt;ref name="noglekvic"/&gt; A new club called '''NK Kvarner''' was established in 1946 to replace them and used the stadium in 1946, before moving to Campo Cellini until 1951. The club returned to Stadion Kantrida following renovation in 1951 and used it interchangeably with Campo Cellini until the mid-1950s. NK Kvarner changed their name to '''NK Rijeka''' in 1954. Since the mid-1950s, Stadion Kantrida has served as Rijeka's home ground.&lt;ref name="noglekkant"/&gt;

The stadium was renovated twice, in 1951 and 1958. It formerly had a capacity of 25,000, but in 1999 this was reduced to approximately 10,600 (due to the gradual evolution of [[UEFA]] safety standards) and [[Floodlights (sport)|floodlight]]s were installed in 1975.&lt;ref name="noglekkant"/&gt; In August 2012, a new 80m² [[LED display]] was installed, the largest in Croatia and one of the ten largest in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.novilist.hr/Sport/Nogomet/Kantrida-dobiva-LED-semafor-od-80-kvadrata | title=Kantrida dobiva LED semafor od 80 kvadrata | publisher=[[Novi List]] | date=9 June 2012|language=Croatian|accessdate=19 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.hrt.hr/index.php?id=466&amp;tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=177880&amp;tx_ttnews%5BbackPid%5D=465&amp;cHash=9ebf004e00 | title=Najmoderniji semafor u Hrvatskoj | publisher=[[Croatian Radiotelevision|HRT]] | date=28 August 2012|language=Croatian|accessdate=29 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2013, Adamić press published a monograph that accounts for the first one-hundred years of Stadion Kantrida's history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.rijeka.hr/PredstavljenaMonografija100 | title=Predstavljena Monografija 100 Godina Stadiona Kantrida | publisher=[[Rijeka|City of Rijeka]] | date=17 December 2013|language=Croatian|accessdate=2 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marinko Lazzarich, Ivo Paškvan, Ferrucco Burburan, Zlatko Moranjak (2013) (in Croatian).

The final [[Prva HNL]] match prior to stadium reconstruction was played on 19 July 2015, when the match between [[HNK Rijeka]] and [[NK Slaven Belupo]] ended in a 3–3 draw.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://prvahnl.hr/matches/271098/rijeka-slaven-belupo-33/ | title=Rijeka - Slaven Belupo 3:3 | publisher=MAXtv Prva HNL | date=19 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 27 February 2016, Kantrida hosted a match between [[HNK Orijent 1919]], a fourth tier club from Rijeka, and NK Lošinj, a fellow [[Inter-county league Rijeka|4. HNL]] club. The match was played at Kantrida due to pitch upgrade on Orijent's home ground.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.sportcom.hr/lokalni-sport/nogomet/cetvrta-liga-z/4-hnl-orijent-na-kisom-natopljenoj-kantridi-svladao-losinj-i-zapoceo-put-prema-vrhu.html | title=4.

Since August 2018, Kantrida also hosts [[NK Opatija]], who play in the [[Croatian Third Football League|3. HNL]]. On 8 September 2018, HNK Rijeka returned to Kantrida, where they hosted [[NK Maribor]] in a friendly match organised by [[Armada Rijeka]], played in front of capacity crowd of over 10,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nk-rijeka.hr/vijest/rijeka-pobijedila-maribor-na-kantridi/ | title=Rijeka pobijedila Maribor na Kantridi | publisher=HNK Rijeka | language=Croatian|  date=8 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Future==
On 11 July 2014, [[HNK Rijeka]] President Damir Mišković released detailed structure design for the new Kantrida stadium.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stadionkantrida.hr/en/ Official Project Website]&lt;/ref&gt; The current stadium is scheduled to be demolished in the near future and a new, state of the art, stadium built at the same location. The capacity of the new stadium will be 14,438, with all of the seats covered. The stadium will be UEFA [[UEFA stadium categories|category four]]. The construction of the stadium will be privately funded and the cost has been estimated at €25 million, excluding the cost of commercial facilities (hotel and shopping centre) that will be built next to the stadium. The architect of the project is Gino Zavanella who was also one of the architects of [[Juventus Stadium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://radio.hrt.hr/radio-rijeka/clanak/video-nova-kantrida/63426/ | title=Nova Kantrida | publisher=Radio Rijeka | date=11 July 2014|language=Croatian|accessdate=12 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the stadium construction, HNK Rijeka play their home games at the newly built [[Stadion Rujevica]].

==Reviews==
Kantrida is regarded by many as one of the most original and beautiful stadiums in the world. The stadium's location between a giant cliff and the sea earned it a place in the list of the world's most unusual football stadiums, compiled in 2011 by the [[CNN]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://edition.cnn.com/2011/SPORT/football/09/05/football.weird.football.stadiums/index.html | title=World's most unusual football stadiums | work=edition.cnn.com | publisher=[[CNN]] | date=9 November 2011 | accessdate=4 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2014, the stadium was included in "The World's Top 13 Most Beautiful Sports Venues", as compiled by [[Eurosport]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://eurosport.yahoo.com/video/worlds-most-beautiful-sports-venues-143430265.html | title=The World's Most Beautiful Sports Venues | publisher=[[Eurosport]] | date=9 April 2014 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140413150651/https://eurosport.yahoo.com/video/worlds-most-beautiful-sports-venues-143430265.html | archivedate=13 April 2014 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2015, ''[[FourFourTwo]]'' included the stadium in its list of the world's 12 most beautiful football stadiums.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.fourfourtwo.com/features/12-most-beautiful-football-stadiums-world | title=The 12 most beautiful football stadiums in the world |  publisher=[[FourFourTwo]] | date=12 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other uses==
In addition to hosting [[HNK Rijeka]] matches until July 2015, the stadium was occasionally used to host other football matches and rock concerts. For example, in July 2006, the stadium hosted the Italian [[Pop music|pop]] star [[Eros Ramazzotti]]. Kantrida also hosted the final stages of the annual [[Kvarnerska Rivijera]] international youth football tournament, first held in 1953.&lt;ref name="noglekkant"/&gt;&lt;ref name="noglekkva"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nogomet.lzmk.hr/clanak.aspx?id=1438|title=Kvarnerska rivijera|work=Nogometni leksikon|publisher=[[Miroslav Krleža Lexicographical Institute]]|language=Croatian|accessdate=18 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, since 1990, the [[Croatia national football team]] played 11 international fixtures at Kantrida, including ten friendlies and one [[UEFA Euro 2012 qualifying Group F|UEFA Euro 2012]] qualifying fixture.

Racing has taken place at Thurles since 1732 when a three-day festival took place at the venue.

The course is located 1.5km west of the town centre. The course is an oval right handed track of one and a quarter miles with 6 flights of hurdles and 7 steeplechase fences in each circuit with a steep uphill finish.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.goracing.ie/HRI/Whats-On/Racecourses/Thurles/ |title=Course Profile|date=|work=Go Racing|accessdate=19 September 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Women in society sidebar}}

'''Women's sports''' includes [[amateur sports|amateur]] as well as [[women's professional sports]], in all varieties of [[sports]]. Female participation and popularity in sports increased dramatically in the twentieth century, especially in the last quarter-century, reflecting changes in modern societies that emphasized [[gender]] parity. Although the level of participation and performance still varies greatly by [[country]] and by [[Sports|sport]], [[women]]'s sports are widely accepted throughout the world today. In a few instances, such as [[figure skating]], female athletes rival or exceed their [[male]] counterparts in popularity. In many sports women usually do not compete on equal terms against men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Ross Tucker, The Science of Sport |url=http://www.sportsscientists.com/2010/04/let-male-and-female-compete-together.html |title=Let male and female compete together &amp;#124; The Science of Sport |publisher=SportsScientists.com |date=2010-04-15 |access-date=2016-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although there has been a rise in participation by women in sports, a large disparity still remains.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://thesportjournal.org/article/examination-of-gender-equity-and-female-participation-in-sport/ |title=Examination of Gender Equity and Female Participation in Sport |date=2016-02-26 |newspaper=The Sport Journal |access-date=2017-02-08 |language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; These disparities are prevalent globally and continue to hinder equality in sports. Many institutions and programs still remain conservative and do not contribute to gender equity in sports.

==History==

===Ancient civilizations===
{{expand section|date=October 2011}}
[[File:Villa romana bikini girls.JPG|thumb|Roman women engaged in sports. [[Mosaic]] at the [[Villa del Casale|Villa Romana del Casale]] near [[Piazza Armerina]] in [[Sicily]]]]
[[File:Greek Runner Maiden 2.png|thumb|A statue of a victress of the Heraean Games, represented near the start of a race]]
Before each [[ancient Olympic Games]] there was a separate women's athletic event held at the same stadium in Olympia, the [[Heraean Games]],  dedicated to the goddess [[Hera]]. Myth held that the Heraea was founded by [[Hippodameia]], the wife of the king who founded the Olympics.&lt;ref name=Scanlon&gt;{{cite web |author=Scanlon, Thomas F. |title=Games for Girls |work="Ancient Olympics Guide" |url=http://www.archaeology.org/online/features/olympics/girls.html |access-date=February 18, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to E. Norman Gardiner:

{{Quote| At the festival there were races for maidens of various ages. Their course was 500 feet, or one-sixth less than the men's stadium. The maidens ran with their hair down their backs, a short tunic reaching just below the knee, and their right shoulder bare to the breast. The victors received crowns of olive and a share of the heifer sacrificed to Hera. They had, too, the right of setting up their statues in the Heraeum.&lt;ref&gt;Gardiner, E. Norman, 'The Rise of the Athletic Festival' in ''Greek Athletic Sport and Festivals'', London:MacMillan, 1910, pp. 47–48&lt;/ref&gt; }}

Although married women were excluded from the Olympics even as spectators, [[Cynisca]] won an Olympic game as owner of a chariot (champions of chariot races were owners not riders), as did [[Euryleonis]], [[Belistiche]], [[Polycrates of Argos|Zeuxo, Encrateia and Hermione]], Timareta, Theodota and Cassia.

After the classical period, there was some participation by women in men's athletic festivals.&lt;ref name=Scanlon/&gt; Women in Sparta began to practice the same athletic exercises that men did, exhibiting the qualities of Spartan soldiers. Plato even supported women in sports by advocating running and sword-fighting for women.&lt;ref&gt;Swaddling, Judith. The Ancient Olympic Games. Austin: U of Texas, 1980. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Notably, cultural representations of a pronounced female physicality were not limited to sport in Ancient Greece and can also be found in representations of a group of warrioresses known as the [[Amazons]].

===Early modern===
During the [[Song dynasty|Song]], [[Yuan dynasty|Yuan]], and [[Ming dynasty|Ming]] dynasties, women played in professional [[Cuju]] teams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://features.cultural-china.com/cuju/index02.html |title=Cuju – Ancient Chinese Football |author= |date= |work=Cultural-China.com |access-date=April 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://features.cultural-china.com/cuju/ |title=Cuju – Ancient Chinese Football |author= |date= |work=Cultural-China.com |access-date=April 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Chujutu.jpg|thumb|Chinese ladies playing ''cuju'', by the [[Ming Dynasty]] painter [[Du Jin]]]] The first Olympic games in the modern era, which were in 1896 were not open to women, but since then the number of women who have participated in the Olympic games have increased dramatically.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Olympic.org |title=Women and Sport Commission |url=http://www.olympic.org/women-sport-commission |work=Olympic.org |access-date=January 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===19th and early 20th centuries===
The educational committees of the [[French Revolution]] (1789) included intellectual, moral, and physical education for both girls and boys. With the victory of Napoleon less than twenty years later, physical education was reduced to military preparedness for boys and men. In Germany, the physical education of [[GutsMuths]] (1793) included girl's education. This included the measurement of performances of girls. This led to women's sport being more actively pursued in Germany than in most other countries.&lt;ref&gt;[[Arnd Krüger]] (2003): ''Germany'', in: [[James Riordan]] &amp; [[Arnd Krüger]] (eds.): ''European Cultures in Sport. Examining the Nations and Regions''. Bristol: Intellect 2003, pp. 57 – 88.&lt;/ref&gt; When the [[Fédération Sportive Féminine Internationale]] was formed as an all women's international organization it had a German male vice-president in addition to German international success in elite sports.

Women's sports in the late 1800s focused on correct posture, facial and bodily beauty, muscles, and health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Padgett |first1=Jessica |title=The Issues of Women in Sport |url=http://serendip.brynmawr.edu/local/scisoc/sports02/papers/jpadgett.html |website=Serendip Studio |accessdate=7 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to 1870, activities for women were recreational rather than sport-specific in nature. They were noncompetitive, informal, rule-less; they emphasized physical activity rather than competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Bell |first1=Richard |title=A History of Women in Sport Prior to Title IX |url=http://thesportjournal.org/article/a-history-of-women-in-sport-prior-to-title-ix/ |website=The Sport Journal |accessdate=7 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sports for women before the 20th century placed more emphasis on fitness rather than the competitive aspects we now associate with all sports.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://thesportjournal.org/article/a-history-of-women-in-sport-prior-to-title-ix/ |title=A History of Women in Sport Prior to Title IX |date=2008-03-14 |newspaper=The Sport Journal |access-date=2017-02-05 |language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1916 the [[Amateur Athletic Union]] (AAU) held its first national championship for women (in swimming),{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DWmCWO6SpsYC&amp;pg=PA26&amp;lpg=PA26&amp;dq=In+1916+the+Amateur+Athletic+Union+(AAU)+held+its+first+national+championship+for+women.&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=6Xh1YQtV58&amp;sig=Ec4urY3ZtRZHwkwG708ffcsqIh8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi2v5WZ1vnRAhUH92MKHZBaCogQ6AEIIjAB#v=onepage&amp;q=In%201916%20the%20Amateur%20Athletic%20Union%20(AAU)%20held%20its%20first%20national%20championship%20for%20women.&amp;f=false |title=Outstanding Women Athletes: Who They are and how They Influenced Sports in America |last=Woolum |first=Janet |date=1998-01-01 |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group |isbn=9781573561204 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1923 the AAU also sponsored the [[1923 USA Outdoor Track and Field Championships|First American Track &amp; Field championships for women]]. Earlier that year the [[Women's Amateur Athletic Association]] (WAAA) held [[1923 WAAA Championships|the first WAAA Championships]].

Few women competed in sports in Europe and North America before the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, as social changes favored increased female participation in society as equals with men. Although women were technically permitted to participate in many sports, relatively few did. There was often disapproval of those who did.

"Bicycling has done more to emancipate women than anything else in the world." [[Susan B. Anthony]] said "I stand and rejoice every time I see a woman ride on a wheel. It gives women a feeling of freedom and self-reliance."

The modern [[Olympic Games|Olympics]] had female competitors from 1900 onward, though women at first participated in considerably fewer events than men. Women first made their appearance in the Olympic Games in Paris in 1900. That year, 22 women competed in tennis, sailing, croquet, equestrian, and golf.&lt;ref&gt;"Equality for Women in the Olympics." Feminist Majority Foundation. Web. November 2014. http://www.feminist.org/sports/olympics.asp&lt;/ref&gt;  As of the IOC-Congress in Paris 1914 a woman's medal had formally the same weight as a man's in the official medal table. This left the decisions about women's participation to the individual international sports federations.&lt;ref&gt;[[Arnd Krüger]]: Forgotton Decisions. The IOC on the Eve of World War I, in: ''Olympika'' 6 (1997), 85 – 98. &lt;http://www.la84foundation.org/SportsLibrary/Olympika/Olympika_1997/olympika0601g.pdf&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Concern over the physical strength and stamina of women led to the discouragement of female participation in more physically intensive sports, and in some cases led to less physically demanding female versions of male sports.  Thus [[netball]] was developed out of [[basketball]] and [[softball]] out of [[baseball]].

In response to the lack of support for women's international sport the [[Fédération Sportive Féminine Internationale]] was founded in France by [[Alice Milliat]]. This organization initiated the Women's Olympiad (held [[1921 Women's Olympiad|1921]], [[1922 Women's Olympiad|1922]] and [[1923 Women's Olympiad|1923]]) and the [[Women's World Games]], which attracted participation of nearly 20 countries and was held four times ([[1922 Women's World Games|1922]], [[1926 Women's World Games|1926]], [[1930 Women's World Games|1930]] and [[1934 Women's World Games|1934]]).&lt;ref name="LeighBonin"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Leigh |first=Mary H. |author2=Bonin, Thérèse M. |title=The Pioneering Role Of Madame Alice Milliat and the FSFI in Establishing International Trade and Field Competition for Women |journal=Journal of Sport History |volume=4 |issue=1 |pages=72–83 |publisher=North American Society for Sport History |year=1977 |url=http://www.la84foundation.org/SportsLibrary/JSH/JSH1977/JSH0401/jsh0401f.pdf |accessdate=3 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1924 the [[1924 Women's Olympiad]] was held at [[Stamford Bridge (stadium)|Stamford Bridge]] in [[London]]. The [[International Olympic Committee]] began to incorporate greater participation of [[women at the Olympics]] in response. The number of Olympic women athletes increased over five-fold in the period, going from 65 at the [[1920 Summer Olympics]] to 331 at the [[1936 Summer Olympics]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.olympic.org/antwerp-1920-summer-olympics Antwerp 1920].

Most early women's professional sports leagues foundered.  This is often attributed to a lack of spectator support.  Amateur competitions became the primary venue for women's sports. Throughout the mid-twentieth century, Communist countries dominated many [[Olympic sports]], including women's sports, due to state-sponsored athletic programs that were technically regarded as amateur.  The legacy of these programs endured, as former Communist countries continue to produce many of the top female athletes. Germany and Scandinavia also developed strong women's athletic programs in this period.

In 1972, the United States government implemented [[Title IX]], a law stating that any federally funded program cannot discriminate anyone based on their sex.&lt;ref name="Empowering Women in Sports"&gt;{{cite web |first=Femenist Majority Foundation |title=Empowering Women in Sports |url=http://www.feminist.org/research/sports/sports12.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Participation by women in sports increased dramatically after its introduction, amid fears that this new law would jeopardize men's sports programs.&lt;ref name="Empowering Women in Sports"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Greenberg |first=Judith E. |title=Getting into the Game: Women and Sports |year=1997 |publisher=Franklin Watts |location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Title IX has had a significant impact on athletics at the high school and collegiate level for female students. "In 1971, fewer than 295,000 girls participated in high school varsity athletics, accounting for just 7 percent of all varsity athletes; in 2001, that number leaped to 2.8 million, or 41.5 percent of all varsity athletes, according to the National Coalition for Women and Girls in Education. In 1966, 16,000 females competed in intercollegiate athletics. By 2001, that number jumped to more than 150,000, accounting for 43 percent of all college athletes. In addition, a 2008 study of intercollegiate athletics showed that women's collegiate sports had grown to 9,101 teams, or 8.65 per school".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Winslow |first1=Barbara |title=The Impact of Title IX |url=https://www.gilderlehrman.org/history-by-era/seventies/essays/impact-title-ix |website=The Gilder Lehrman Institute of American History}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the implementation of Title IX, many high schools and colleges still have huge gender disparities based on sports. According to research done by National Women's Law Center in 2011,4500 public high schools across the nation have extremely high gender inequality and are violating the Title  IX laws.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Wong, A.

There is also a huge disparity regarding sport related scholarships for men and women, with men getting 190 million more in funding than women.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Wallace, K. (2016, March 14).

This disparity shows the link between race and gender, and how it plays a significant role in the hierarchy of sports.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

In 1990, [[Bernadette Mattox]] became the first female Division I coach of a men's basketball team, serving as an assistant at the [[Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball|University of Kentucky]]. A year later, goaltender Jenny Hanley of [[Hamline University]] became the first women to play on a men's college ice hockey team.&lt;ref name="Part 6- 1990-1997"&gt;{{cite web |first=History of Women in sports timeline |title=Part 6- 1990–1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1994, the number of females playing sports in high school had increased threefold since Title IX was implemented, and ground was broken for the [[Women's Basketball Hall of Fame]], the first such hall of fame devoted exclusively to female athletes (though men can be, and have been, inducted in non-playing roles). In 1996 the number of female high school athletes reached 2.4 million, including 819 football players, 1164 wrestlers, and 1471 ice hockey players.&lt;ref name="Part 6- 1990-1997"/&gt;

====Canada====

{{main|History of Canadian women}}
Sports are a high priority in Canadian culture, but women were long relegated to second-class status. There were also regional differences, with the eastern provinces emphasizing a more feminine "girls rule" game of basketball, while the Western provinces preferred identical rules.  Girls' and women's sport have traditionally been slowed down by a series of factors: both historically have low levels of interest and participation.  There were very few women in leadership positions in academic administration, student affairs or athletics and not many female coaches.  The media strongly emphasized men's sports as a demonstration of masculinity, suggesting that women seriously interested in sports were crossing gender lines with the male sports establishment actively hostile. Staunch feminists dismissed sports and thought of them as unworthy of their support. Women's progress was uphill; they first had to counter the common notion that women's bodies were restricted and delicate and that vigorous physical activity was dangerous. These notions where first challenged by the "new women" around 1900. These women started with bicycling; they rode into new gender spaces in education, work, and suffrage. The 1920s marked a breakthrough for women, including working-class young women in addition to the pioneering middle class sportswomen.&lt;ref&gt;M.

====United Kingdom====
{{main|Sport in the United Kingdom}}
The [[United Kingdom]] has produced a range of major international sports including: association football, rugby (union and league), cricket, netball, darts, golf, tennis, table tennis, badminton, squash, bowls, rounders, modern rowing, hockey, boxing, snooker, billiards, and curling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Nauright |first1=John |last2=Parrish |first2=Charles |title=Sports around the World: History, Culture, and Practice |date=2012 |publisher=ABC-CLIO |isbn=9781598843019 |pages=169.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 19th century, women primarily participated in the "new games" which included golf, lawn tennis, cycling, and hockey. Now, women also participate at a professional/international level in football, rugby, cricket, and netball.

Since the late 1980s, Women In Sport,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Women In Sport |url=https://www.womeninsport.org |website=Women In Sport |publisher=Charities Commission |accessdate=27 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; a non-profit organization, has hoped to transform sport for the benefit of women and girls in the UK. Based in London, the organization's mission is to "champion the right of every woman and girl in the UK to take part in, and benefit from, sport: from the field of play to the boardroom, from early years and throughout her life".

==United States: Title IX==
===Implementation and regulation===
In 1972 the [[United States Congress|Congress]] passed the Title IX legislation as a part of the additional Amendment Act to the 1964 Civil Rights Act.&lt;ref name="Steiner 1995"&gt;{{cite book |last=Steiner |first=Andy |title=A Sporting Chance: Sports and Genders |year=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; Title IX states that: "no person shall on the basis of sex, be excluded from participating in, be denied benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any educational programs or activities receiving federal financial assistance...";&lt;ref name="Greenburg_1997"&gt;{{cite book |last=Greenburg |first=Judith. E |title=Getting into the Game: Women and Sports |year=1997 |publisher=Franklin Watts |location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; in other words, Title IX prohibits gender discrimination in schools that receive federal funds through grants, scholarships, or other support for students. The law states that federal funds can be withdrawn from a school engaging in intentional gender discrimination in the provision of curriculum, counseling, academic support, or general educational opportunities; this includes interscholastic or varsity sports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Coakley |first=Jay |title=Sports in Society |year=2007 |publisher=McGraw-Hill |location=New York |page=238}}&lt;/ref&gt; This law from the Education Act requires that both male and female athletes have equal facilities and equal benefits. The equal benefits are the necessities such as equal equipment, uniforms, supplies, training, practice, quality in coaches and opponents, awards, cheerleaders and bands at the game.&lt;ref name="Greenburg_1997"/&gt; In practice, the difficulty{{According to whom|date=April 2017}} with Title IX is making sure schools are compliant with the law. In 1979, there was a policy interpretation that offered three ways in which schools could be compliant with Title IX; it became known as the "three-part test". 
# Providing athletic participation opportunities that are substantially proportionate to the student enrollment. This prong of the test is satisfied when participation opportunities for men and women are "substantially proportionate" to their respective undergraduate enrollment.
# Demonstrating a continual expansion of athletic opportunities for the underrepresented sex. This prong of the test is satisfied when an institution has a history and continuing practice of program expansion that is responsive to the developing interests and abilities of the underrepresented sex (typically female).
# Accommodating the interest and ability of the underrepresented sex. This prong of the test is satisfied when an institution is meeting the interests and abilities of its female students even where there are disproportionately fewer females than males participating in sports.
Although schools only have to be compliant with one of the three prongs, many schools have not managed to achieve equality. Many schools attempt to achieve compliance through the first prong; however, in order to achieve that compliance schools cut men's programs, which is not the way the OCR wanted compliance achieved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Irons |first=Alicia |title=The Economic Inefficiency of Title IX |journal=Major Themes in Economics |date=Spring 2006 |url=http://business.uni.edu/economics/Themes/irons.pdf |access-date=April 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Equity is not the only way to be compliant with Title IX; athletic departments need to show that they are making efforts to achieve parity in participation, treatment, and athletic financial assistance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Title IX Information |url=http://www.nacwaa.org/advocacy/title-ix/information |access-date=April 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Through implementation, Title IX provides equal opportunities for female students and athletes. However, Title IX did not fully define how governance will take place in regard to sports. Most sport teams or institutions, regardless of gender, are managed by male coaches and managers. This lack of women is because many institutions prefer a dominant male presence in order to preserve the traditional masculinity hegemony present in institutions and professional leagues, in relation to sports.{{According to whom|date=April 2017}} The societal norm of masculinity in connection to sports has hindered the growth of leaders in sports.{{According to whom|date=April 2017}} According to 2016 data, 33% of WNBA teams are led by women coaches or managers.&lt;ref name="Senne_2016"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://thesportjournal.org/article/examination-of-gender-equity-and-female-participation-in-sport/ |title=Examination of Gender Equity and Female Participation in Sport |author=Senne |date=February 26, 2016 |work=TheSportJournal.org |access-date=April 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The International Olympic Committee also consists of 20% female members.&lt;ref name="Senne_2016"/&gt; The data presented also showed that 15% of athletic directors in colleges nationwide were females, and that number is much less in the southern states.&lt;ref name="Senne_2016"/&gt; Although Title IX was a breakthrough for women regarding funding and sport itself, the main goal is far from achieved. The disparity of men and women sport is prevalent and a significant one at that. The more alarming instance is the lack of female leadership in the sports world. The disparity will persist if the gap within leadership it not first fixed.{{According to whom|date=April 2017}}

===Effect on women's sports===
The main objective of Title IX is to make sure there is equal treatment in sports and school, regardless of sex, in a federally funded program. It was also used to provide protection to those who are being discriminated due to their gender.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=The United States Department of Judgement |url=http://www.justice.gov/crt/about/cor/coord/titleix.php |access-date=November 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, Title IX is most commonly associated with its impact on athletics and more specifically the impact it has had on women's participation in athletics at every age. Today{{When|date=April 2017}} there are more females participating in athletics than ever before. As of the 2007–2008 school year, females made up 41% of the participants in college athletics.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web |title=Title IX Athletic Statistics |url=http://www.aauw.org/act/laf/library/athleticStatistics.cfm |accessdate=February 16, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111114061928/http://www.aauw.org/act/laf/library/athleticStatistics.cfm |archivedate=November 14, 2011 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; To see the growth of women's sports, consider the difference in participation before the passing of Title IX and today. In 1971–1972 there were 294,015 females participating in high school athletics and in 2007–2008 there were over three million females participating, meaning there has been a 940% increase in female participation in high school athletics.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

In 1971–1972 there were 29,972 females participating in college athletics and in 2007–2008 there were 166,728 females participating, a 456% increase in female participation in college athletics.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; In 1971, less than 300,000 females played in high school sports. After the law was passed many females started to get involved in sports. By 1990, eighteen years later, 1.9 million female high school students were playing sports.&lt;ref name="Steiner 1995"/&gt; Increased participation in sports has had a direct impact on other areas of women's lives; these effects can be seen in women's education and employment later on in life; a 2010 study found that the changes set in motion by Title IX explained about 20 percent of the increase in women's education and about 40 percent of the rise in employment for 25-to-34-year-old women.&lt;ref name="parker1"&gt;{{cite news |last=Parker-Pope |first=Tara |title=As Girls Become Women, Sports Pay Dividends |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/16/health/16well.html |publisher=New York Times |access-date=February 16, 2012 |date=February 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is not to say that all women who are successful later on in life played sports, but it is saying that women who did participate in athletics received benefits in their education and employment later on in life.&lt;ref name="parker1"/&gt;

In 1971, fewer than 295,000 girls participated in high school varsity athletics, accounting for just 7 percent of all varsity athletes; in 2001, that number leaped to 2.8 million, or 41.5 percent of all varsity athletes, according to the National Coalition for Women and Girls in Education.{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}} In 1966, 16,000 females competed in intercollegiate athletics. By 2001, that number jumped to more than 150,000, accounting for 43 percent of all college athletes. In addition, a 2008 study of intercollegiate athletics showed that women's collegiate sports had grown to 9,101 teams, or 8.65 per school. The five most frequently offered college sports for women are, in order: (1) basketball, 98.8% of schools have a team, (2) volleyball, 95.7%, (3) soccer, 92.0%, (4) cross country, 90.8%, and (5) softball, 89.2%. Since 1972, women have also competed in the traditional male sports of wrestling, weightlifting, rugby, and boxing. An article in the ''New York Times'' found that there are lasting benefits for women from Title IX: participation in sports increased education as well as employment opportunities for girls.{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}} Furthermore, the athletic participation by girls and women spurred by Title IX was associated with lower obesity rates. No other public health program can claim similar success.&lt;ref name="gilderlehrman.org"&gt;{{cite web |last=Winslow |first=Barbara |url=http://www.gilderlehrman.org/history-by-era/seventies/essays/impact-title-ix |title=The Impact of Title IX &amp;#124; The Gilder Lehrman Institute of American History |publisher=Gilderlehrman.org |date= |access-date=March 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"However, as part of the backlash against the women's movement, opposition quickly organized against Title IX. Worried about how it would affect men's athletics, legislators and collegiate sports officials became concerned and looked for ways to limit its influence. One argument was that revenue-producing sports such as college football should be exempted from Title IX compliance. Another was that in order for schools and colleges to comply, they would have to cut men's sports such as wrestling. Others argued that federal legislation was not the way to achieve equality or even parity. Finally, conservative opponents of women's rights believed that feminists used Title IX as an all-purpose vehicle to advance their agenda in the schools. Since 1975, there have been twenty court challenges to Title IX in an attempt to whittle down greater gender equity in all fields of education—mirroring the ups and downs of the women's movement at large. According to the National Federation of State High School Associations, female students received 1.3 million fewer opportunities to participate in high school athletics than their male peers in the 2006–2007 school years. Yet as a result of Title IX, women have benefited from involvement in amateur and professional sports and, in turn, sports are more exciting with their participation."&lt;ref name="gilderlehrman.org"/&gt;

Women make up 54% of enrollment at 832 schools that responded to an NCAA gender equity study in 2000; however, females at these institutions only account for 41% of the athletes. Before Title IX, 90% of women's college athletic programs were run by women, but by 1992 the number dropped to 42% since Title IX requires that there are equal opportunities for both genders.&lt;ref name="Steiner 1995"/&gt;  This violates Title IX's premise that the ratio of female athletes to male athletes should be roughly equivalent to the overall proportion of female and male students.&lt;ref name="garber1"&gt;{{cite web |last=Garber |first=Greg |title=Landmark law faces new challenges even now |url=http://espn.go.com/gen/womenandsports/020619title9.html |accessdate=February 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the issues today often revolve around the amount of money going into men's and women's sports. According to 2000–2001 figures, men's college programs still have many advantages over women's in the average number of scholarships (60.5%), operating expenses (64.5%), recruiting expenses (68.2%) and head coaching salaries (59.5%).&lt;ref name="garber1"/&gt; Other forms of inequality are in the coaching positions. Before Title IX, women coached 90% of women's teams; in 1978 that percentage dropped to 58, and in 2004 it dropped even more to 44 percent.&lt;ref name="coakley255"&gt;{{cite book |last=Coakley |first=Jay |title=Sports in Society |year=2007 |publisher=McGraw-Hill |location=New York |page=255}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1972, women administered 90 percent of women's athletic programs, and in 2004 this fell to 19 percent. Also in 2004, 18 percent of all women's programs had no women administrators.&lt;ref name="coakley255"/&gt; In 2004, there were 3,356 administrative jobs in NCAA women's athletic programs and of those jobs, women held 35 percent of them.&lt;ref name="coakley255"/&gt;

The fight for equality extends to the wallet. On March 30, 2016, five players from the U.S. women's soccer team filed a federal complaint of wage discrimination against U.S. Soccer, the governing body that pays both the men’s and women’s team. The complaint argues that U.S. Soccer pays players on the women’s team as little as forty percent of what it pays players on the men’s team. This pay discrepancy exists despite the fact that the women’s team has been much more successful in international competitions; the women’s team has won four Olympic gold medals and three of the last five Women’s World Cups, while the men’s team has never won either of these competitions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/01/sports/soccer/uswnt-us-women-carli-lloyd-alex-morgan-hope-solo-complain.html?_r=0 |title=Top Female Players Accuse U.S. Soccer of Wage Discrimination |publisher=The New York Times |author=Andrew Das |date=2016-03-31 |accessdate=2016-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Muslim women are less likely to take part in sport than Western non-Muslims.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/5286568.stm Muslims 'face barriers' over sport]. [[BBC Sport]]. Retrieved on 2015-01-30.&lt;/ref&gt; This is particularly so for [[women in Arab societies]]. The traditions of [[Islamic modesty]] in dress and requirements for women's sport to take place in a [[Sex segregation|single-sex environment]] make sports participation more difficult for devout female adherents. The lack of availability of suitably modest sports clothing and sports facilities that allow women to play in private contributes to the lack of participation. Cultural norms of women's roles and responsibilities towards the family may also be a source of discouragement from time-consuming sports practice.&lt;ref name=Women1&gt;[http://sites.duke.edu/wcwp/research-projects/middle-east/muslim-women-in-sport/#_ftn7 Muslim Women in Sport].

However, Islamic tenets and religious texts suggest that women's sports in general should be promoted and are not against the values of the religion. The Quranic statements that followers of Islam should be healthy, fit and make time for leisure are not sex-specific. The prophet [[Muhammad]] is said to have raced his wife [[Aisha]] on several occasions, with Aisha beating him the first couple of times. Correspondingly, some scholars have proposed that Muslim women's lack of engagement with sport is due to cultural or societal reasons, rather than strictly religious ones.&lt;ref name=Women1/&gt;&lt;ref name=Women2/&gt;

However, besides religious testaments, there are many barriers for Muslim women in relation to sports participation. A significant barrier to Muslim women's sports participation is bans on the Islamic headscarf, commonly known as the [[hijab]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Ayub |first=Awista |date=2011-04-14 |title=A Closer Look at FIFA's Hijab Ban: What it Means for Muslim Players and Lessons Learned |url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/425421 |journal=SAIS Review of International Affairs |volume=31 |issue=1 |pages=43–50 |doi=10.1353/sais.2011.0010 |issn=1945-4724}}&lt;/ref&gt; FIFA instituted such a ban in 2011, preventing the Iranian women's national football team from competing.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; They have since repealed the ban, but other organizations, including FIBA, maintain such regulations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://muslimmatters.org/2016/07/19/muslim-basketball-players-urge-fiba-to-allow-hijab/ |title=» Muslim Basketball Players Urge FIBA To Allow Hijab |access-date=2016-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, many Muslim female athletes have achieved significant success in athletic competitions.

Iranian women were banned from attending a volleyball game and an Iranian girl was arrested for attending a match. Iran was given the right to host the International Beach Volleyball tournament, and many Iranian women were looking forward to attending the event. However, when the women tried to attend the event, they were disallowed, and told it was forbidden to attend by the FIVB. The women took to social media to share their outrage; however the Federation of International Beach volleyball refuted the accusations, saying it was a misunderstanding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nytlive.nytimes.com/womenintheworld/2016/08/17/iranian-women-should-not-face-arrest-and-threats-for-watching-volleyball/ |title=Iranian women should not face arrest and threats for watching volleyball |author= |date=August 17, 2016 |work=NYTimes.com |access-date=April 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is one of the instances of unfair treatment of women, trying to participate in supporting their teams in Iran.

===World conferences===

In 1994, the International Working Group on Women and Sport organized the first World Conference on Women and Sport in Brighton, United Kingdom, where the Brighton Declaration was published. The IWG hosted further world conferences every four years, with the result of the Windfoek Call for Action (1998), Montreal Tool Kit (2002) and Brighton Plus Helsinki 2014 Declaration (2014). The conferences pretend to "develop a sporting culture that enables and values the full involvement of women in every aspect of sport and physical activity", by "increas[ing] the involvement of women in sport at all levels and in all functions and roles".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fisu.net/medias/fichiers/EN_Helsinki_calls_the_world_of_sport_to_LEAD_THE_CHANGE_BE_THE_CHANGE_2.pdf 6th IWG World Conference on Women and Sport 2014 – The Legacy Document]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Media coverage==

Media coverage for women's sports is significantly less than the coverage for men's sports. In 1989, a study was conducted that recorded and compared the amount of media coverage of men and women's sports on popular sports commentary shows.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} Michael Messner and his team in 2010 analyzed three different two-week periods by recording the amount of time that the stories were on air and the content of the stories. After recording sports news and highlights, they wrote a quantitative description of what they saw and a qualitative description of the amount of time that story received.&lt;ref&gt;Messner, Michael A., and Cheryl Cooky (2010): [https://dornsifecms.usc.edu/assets/sites/80/docs/tvsports.pdf "Gender in Televised Sports"]. n. pag. Dornsife.usc.edu. Center for Feminist Research, University of Southern California, June 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

During that first year that the research was conducted in 1989, it was recorded that 5% of the sports segments were based on women's sports, compared to the 92% that were based on men's sports and the 3% that was a combination of both. In 1999, women's sports coverage reached an all-time high when it was recorded at 8.7%. It maintained its higher percentages until it reached an all-time low in 2009, decreasing to 1.6%. The researchers also measured the amount of time that women's sports were reported in the [[news ticker]], the strip that displays information at the bottom of most news broadcasts. When recorded in 2009, 5% of ticker coverage was based on women's sports, compared to the 95% that was based on men's sports. These percentages were recorded in order to compare the amount of media coverage for each gender.

When researching the actual amount of time that women's sports stories were mentioned, they focused specifically on differences between the [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA) and the [[Women's National Basketball Association]]. They recorded two different time periods: when they were in season and when they were off-season. The WNBA had 8 stories, totaling 5:31 minutes, during their season, which was less than the NBA, which had a total of 72 stories, totaling approximately 65:51 minutes. During the off-season, the WNBA did not receive any stories or time on the ticker, while the NBA received a total of 81, which were approximately 50:15 minutes. When compared, the WNBA had a total of 8 stories and 5:31 minutes while the NBA had 153 stories and 1:56:06 hours. The actual games had several differences in the way the games were presented. The findings were that WNBA games had lower sound quality, more editing mistakes, fewer views of the shot clock and fewer camera angles. There was less verbal commentary and visual statistics about the players throughout the games as well.&lt;ref&gt;"Gender Stereotyping in Televised Sports." LA 48 Foundation. June 2010. Web. November 2014. http://www.la84.org/gender-stereotyping-in-televised-sports/&lt;/ref&gt; The quality of the stories has also significantly changed. In past studies, women were sexualized, portrayed as violent, or portrayed as girlfriends, wives and mothers. Female athletes were often included in gag stories that involved sexual dialogue or emphasized their bodies. In Australia, the wives of the men's cricket team members were given more media coverage than the players on the women's cricket team, who also had won more games than the men's rugby team.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes, Tracy.

In newspapers articles, coverage on men's sports once again had a greater number of articles than women's sports in a ratio of 23–1. In 1990, a study was conducted that recorded and compared the amount of media coverage of men and women's sports on popular newspapers. They analyzed four different sports magazines for three months and recorded the number of women's sports stories that were featured and the content of the stories. Women's sports made up 3.5%, compared to the 81% of men's coverage. The lengths of these articles were 25–27% shorter than the length of men's articles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.la84.org/coverage-of-womens-sports-in-four-daily-newspapers/ |title=Coverage of Women’s Sports in Four Daily Newspapers – LA84 Foundation |author= |date= |work=LA84.org |access-date=April 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was an international frenzy in 2012 when the first woman that represented Saudi Arabia in the 2012 Olympics competed in track. That was the most women's sports coverage that there had been in several years.Women played 90 minutes of football, 80 minutes of rugby, 18 holes of golf and ran the same distance in a marathon as men https://www.irishtimes.com.{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}} Exactly 12 months later, the newspapers returned to featuring 4% of articles on women's sports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cnn.com/2013/08/07/sport/olympics-women-equality-attar/index.html |title=Why has coverage of women's sport stopped post Olympics? - CNN.com |first=Amanda |last=Davies |date=August 7, 2013 |work=CNN.com |access-date=April 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This same trend can be seen with regards to the FIFA World Cup. The 2015 Women’s World Cup Final had an average of 25.4 million American viewers throughout the duration of the match, and peaked at 30.9 million viewers.&lt;ref&gt;Deitsch, Richard. "USA-Japan's Women's World Cup Final Shatters American TV

Web. 8 May 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; It was the most-viewed game of soccer ever in the United States–men’s or women’s–by a margin of almost 7 million viewers. Despite this jump in viewership of women’s soccer in the U.S., television broadcasting of the women’s professional soccer league in the U.S. remained much lower than that of the men’s league. Fox Sports Network (the company that owns the rights to broadcast the National Women’s Soccer League) broadcast 3 regular season NWSL games and 34 Major League Soccer regular-season games during the 2016 seasons.

Amy Godoy-Pressland conducted a study that investigated the relationship between sports reporting and gender in Great Britain. She studied Great Britain's newspapers from January 2008 to December 2009 and documented how media coverage of men's sports and women's sports was fairly equal during the Olympics and then altered after the Olympics were over. "Sportswomen are disproportionately under-represented and the sheer quantity and quality of news items on sportsmen demonstrates how male athletes are represented as dominant and superior to females." She also documented how women's bodies were sexualized in photographs and written coverage, noting that the women featured were either nude, semi-nude, or wearing revealing clothing. "The sexualization of sportswomen in Sunday reporting is commonplace and aimed at the mostly male readership. It promotes the idea of female aesthetics over achievements, while the coverage of women not directly involved in sport misrepresents the place of women in sport and inferiorizes real sportswomen's achievements."&lt;ref&gt;"Women underrepresented, sexualized in weekend sports reporting" ''Science Daily''.

Excluding women's sports from the media makes it much less likely for young girls to have role models that are women athletes.&lt;ref&gt;Donna A. Lopiano, Ph.D., (2008). Media Coverage of Women's Sports is Important, (2), Sports Management Resources, http://www.sportsmanagementresources.com/library/media-coverage-womens-sports&lt;/ref&gt; According to Tucker Center for Research on Girls &amp; Women in Sport at the University of Minnesota 40% of all athletes in the United States are women but women's sports only receive about 4% of sports media coverage.&lt;ref&gt;University of Minnesota (Producer) and PBS, (2014). Media Coverage &amp; Female Athletes, http://video.tpt.org/video/2365132906/&lt;/ref&gt; This amount of coverage has decreased in the last 20 years although there has been a major increase in women athletes.

Media coverage has slightly increased and this is mostly due to social networking.{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}} Social media has further exposed women sports out to the public world, and often at a much greater rate than traditional news media. Traditional media has also improved its coverage of women's sports through more exposure time and using better equipment to record the events. Recent research has shown that in the past twenty years, camera angles, slow motion replays, quality and graphics regarding the presentation of women sports has gradually improved.&lt;ref name="Cooky, C. 2012"&gt;Cooky, C., &amp; Lavoi, N. (2012). Playing but losing women's sports after title ix. ''Contexts,'' ''11''(1), 42–46. {{jstor|41960748}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, mainstream media still is far behind in its showcasing of female sports in comparison to that of men's. A study has shown that ESPN, which began airing women NCAA tournament in 2003, aired eleven women tournament segments in comparison to one-hundred men's tournament segments.&lt;ref name="Cooky, C. 2012"/&gt; ESPN and other sports outlets are airing more female-oriented sporting events; however the length of the segments are very small. This representative data is showcases a main part of the minimal interaction the media has with women athletes. Media coverage of women sports in the United States has further justified the divisional hierarchy faced by women athletes in terms of popularity and coverage. Scholarly studies (Kane, M. J., LaVoi, N. M., Fink, J. S. (2013) also show that when women athletes were given the option to pick a photo of a picture that would increase respect for their sport, they picked an on-the-court competency picture. However, when women athletes were told to pick a picture that would increase interest in their sport, 47% picked a picture that sexualized the women athlete.&lt;ref&gt;Kane, M. J., LaVoi, N.

The [[National Women's Hockey League]] is an American women's professional ice hockey league, and the [[United Women's Lacrosse League]] is an American professional [[women's lacrosse]] league; both were established in 2015.

Today, women compete professionally and as amateurs in virtually every major sport, though the level of participation typically decreases when it comes to the more violent contact sports;  few schools have women's programs in American football, boxing or wrestling.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}There are exceptions to this, such as the [[Utah Girls Football League]] and [[Professional Girl Wrestling Association]]. However, these typical non-participation habits may slowly be evolving as more women take real interest in the games, for example [[Katie Hnida]] became the first woman ever to score points in a [[Division I (NCAA)|Division I]] [[NCAA]] [[American football]] game when she kicked two [[extra-point]]s for the [[University of New Mexico]] in 2003.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

Modern sports have seen the development of a higher profile for female athletes in other historically male sports, such as [[golf]], [[marathon]]s or [[ice hockey]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}These significant participation rise, has allowed more women to participate in traditionally male dominated sports and increased the sports popularity globally.{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}

As of 2013, the only sports that men, but not women play professionally in the United States are [[American football|football]], [[baseball]], and [[Ultimate Frisbee]].

Recently{{When|date=April 2017}} there has been much more crossover as to which sports males and females participate in, although there are still some differences. For example, at the [[1992 Winter Olympics]], both genders were allowed to participate in the sport of [[figure skating]], previously a female-only sporting event. However, the programs for the event required men to perform three triple jumps, and women only one.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3222">The '''Zaza rule''' is the unofficial title for a rule change in the [[2017–18 NBA season]] concerning reckless closeouts (defensive advancements toward a shooter intended to disrupt a shot or prevent a pass). The namesake of the rule is [[Zaza Pachulia]], then a center for the [[Golden State Warriors]].&lt;ref name=":NBC"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nbcsports.com/boston/boston-celtics/nba-adds-harden-rule-and-zaza-rule-players-safety|title=NBA adds 'Harden Rule' and 'Zaza Rule' for players' safety|last= -|first=Associated Press|website=nbcsports.com|access-date=2017-12-19|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Details and procedure ==
The Zaza Rule allows for referees to call [[Flagrant foul|flagrant]] or [[Technical foul|technical]] fouls on reckless defensive closeouts. After referees call a foul, they now possess the ability to determine if the defender's foot placement was reckless, allowing for an upgrade to flagrant, or to technical if there was no intent to injure determined.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nba.com/article/2017/09/21/nba-refs-can-rule-reckless-closeouts-flagrants-or-techs#/|title=NBA referees can rule closeouts as flagrants or technical fouls {{!}} NBA.com|last=Press|first=BRIAN MAHONEY {{!}} Associated|work=NBA.com|access-date=2017-10-27|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reason for change ==
In the third quarter of Game 1 of the 2017 Western Conference finals against the [[Golden State Warriors]], [[San Antonio Spurs]] star [[Kawhi Leonard]] went up for a field goal attempt, with Pachulia closing in and landing on Leonard's foot, aggravating an ankle injury that Leonard suffered earlier in the game. Leonard left the game and did not return for the rest of the series, and the Spurs eventually lost the Western Conference Finals, 0-4.

== Reaction to Pachulia's play ==
Due to Pachulia's history of physical play,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theringer.com/2017/5/14/16042394/2017-nba-playoffs-san-antonio-spurs-golden-state-warriors-game-1-kawhi-leonard-zaza-pac-ad01327dafa8|title=Zaza Pachulia Is Dirty, or Kawhi’s Injury Was Accidental, or Both|work=The Ringer|access-date=2017-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; many around the league condemned the play as dirty. Spurs coach [[Gregg Popovich]] was one of the most vocal, who said, "‘[Pachulia] didn’t have intent.’ Who gives a damn about what his intent was? You ever heard of manslaughter? You still go to jail I think if you’re Texan and you kill somebody. And you might not have intended to do that. All I care is what I saw. All I care about is what happened. And the history there exacerbates the whole situation and makes me very, very angry."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://uproxx.com/dimemag/gregg-popovich-kawhi-leonard-zaza-pachulia-dirty-play-out-spurs-warriors/3/|title=Gregg Popovich Lit Up Zaza Pachulia For His 'Dirty' Play On Kawhi Leonard|date=2017-05-15|work=UPROXX|access-date=2017-10-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

NBA senior vice president of replay and referee operations Joe Borgia confirmed in a September 2017 interview with the league that Pachulia's closeout would have been considered a flagrant foul.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
