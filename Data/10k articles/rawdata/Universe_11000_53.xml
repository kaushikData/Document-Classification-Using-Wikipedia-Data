'''Bismuth telluride''' (Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Te&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) is a gray powder that is a compound of [[bismuth]] and [[tellurium]] also known as bismuth(III) telluride. It is a [[semiconductor]], which, when alloyed with [[antimony]] or [[selenium]], is an efficient [[Peltier effect|thermoelectric]] material for refrigeration or portable power generation. Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Te&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is a [[topological insulator]], and thus exhibits thickness-dependent physical properties.

==Properties as a thermoelectric material==
Bismuth telluride is a [[band gap|narrow-gap]] layered semiconductor with a trigonal unit cell. The valence and conduction band structure can be described as a many-ellipsoidal model with 6 constant-energy ellipsoids that are centered on the reflection planes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title =Anisotropy of the constant energy surfaces in p-type Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Te&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Se&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; from galvanomagnetic coefficients| journal=Phys. Rev. B| volume = 2 | year =1970| page=3209| doi=10.1103/PhysRevB.2.3209| author =Caywood, L. P.| last2 =Miller| first2 =G.| issue =8| bibcode=1970PhRvB...2.3209C}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Te&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; cleaves easily along the trigonal axis due to [[Van der Waals bonding]] between neighboring tellurium atoms. Due to this, bismuth-telluride-based materials used for power generation or cooling applications must be polycrystalline. Furthermore, the [[Seebeck coefficient]] of bulk Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Te&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; becomes compensated around room temperature, forcing the materials used in power-generation devices to be an alloy of bismuth, antimony, tellurium, and selenium.&lt;ref name=prb1/&gt;

Recently, researchers have attempted to improve the efficiency of Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Te&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-based materials by creating structures where one or more dimensions are reduced, such as nanowires or thin films. In one such instance [[n-type semiconductor|n-type]] bismuth telluride was shown to have an improved [[Seebeck coefficient]] (voltage per unit temperature difference) of −287 μV/K at 54&amp;nbsp;°C,&lt;ref name="Tan"/&gt; However, one must realize that Seebeck coefficient and electrical conductivity have a tradeoff: a higher Seebeck coefficient results in decreased carrier concentration and decreased electrical conductivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Goldsmid, H. J. |author2=Sheard, A. R. |author3=Wright, D. A. |last-author-amp=yes | title=The performance of bismuth telluride thermojunctions | journal=Br. J. Appl.

In another case, researchers report that bismuth telluride has high [[electrical conductivity]] of 1.1×10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; S·m/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; with its very low lattice [[thermal conductivity]] of 1.20 W/(m·K), similar to ordinary [[glass]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| author=Takeiishi, M.

==Properties as a topological insulator==
Bismuth telluride is a well-studied topological insulator. Its physical properties have been shown to change at highly reduced thicknesses, when its conducting surface states are exposed and isolated. These thin samples are obtained through either [[epitaxy]] or mechanical exfoliation.

Epitaxial growth methods such as molecular beam epitaxy and metal organic chemical vapor deposition are common methods of obtaining thin  Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Te&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; samples. The stoichiometry of samples obtained through such techniques can vary greatly between experiments, so [[Raman spectroscopy]] is often used to determine relative purity. However, thin Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Te&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; samples are resistant to Raman spectroscopy due to their low melting point and poor heat dispersion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Teweldebrhan|first1=D.|last2=Goyal|first2=V.|last3=Balandin|first3=A. A,|title=From Graphene to Bismuth Telluride: Mechanical Exfoliation of Quasi-2D Crystals for Applications in Thermoelectrics and Topological Insulators|journal=Nano Letters|date=2010|volume=10|issue=12|pages=1209–18|doi=10.1021/nl903590b |pmid=20205455|bibcode=2010NanoL..10.1209T}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The crystalline structure of Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Te&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; allows for mechanical exfoliation of thin samples by cleaving along the trigonal axis. This process is significantly lower in yield than epitaxial growth, but produces samples without defects or impurities. Similar to extracting [[graphene]] from bulk graphite samples, this is done by applying and removing [[adhesive tape]] from successively thinner samples. This procedure has been used to obtain Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Te&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; flakes with a thickness of 1&amp;nbsp;nm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Teweldebrhan|first1=D.|last2=Goyal|first2=V.|last3=Rahman|first3=M.|last4=Balandin|first4=A. A.|title="Graphene-like" exfoliation of atomically-thin bismuth telluride films|journal=Appl. Phys. Let.|date=2010|volume=96|page=053107|doi=10.1149/1.3485611|series=ECS Transactions}}&lt;!--|accessdate=3 August 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; However, this process can leave significant amounts of adhesive residue on a standard Si/SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; [[substrate (materials science)|substrate]], which in turn obscure [[atomic force microscopy]] measurements and inhibit the placement of contacts on the substrate for purposes of testing. Common cleaning techniques such as oxygen plasma, boiling [[acetone]] and [[isopropyl alcohol]] are ineffective in removing residue..&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Childresa|first1=I.|last2=Tiana|first2=J.|last3=Miotkowskia|first3=I.|last4=Chen|first4=Y.|title=AFM and Raman studies of topological insulator materials subject to argon plasma etching|journal=Philosophical Magazine|date=2011|volume=93|issue=6|pages=681–689|doi=10.1149/1.3485611}}&lt;!--|accessdate=11 July 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Occurrence==
The [[mineral]] form of Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Te&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is [[tellurobismuthite]] which is moderately rare. There are many natural bismuth tellurides of different [[stoichiometry]], as well as compounds of the Bi-Te-S-(Se) system, like Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Te&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S ([[tetradymite]]).

==Preparation==
Bismuth telluride is prepared by sealing a sample of bismuth and tellurium metal in a quartz tube under vacuum (critical, as an unsealed or leaking sample may explode in a furnace) and heating it to 800&amp;nbsp;°C in a [[muffle furnace]].

The '''French Solar Energy Authority''' ('''Commissariat à l'Energie Solaire''', '''ComES'''), a public [[scientific]] and [[Industry|industrial]] entity, was set up in 1978 to promote a comprehensive energy policy based on energy savings, on efficient energy management, and on [[Renewable energy|renewable sources of energy]] ([[photovoltaic]], [[solar thermal]], [[wind power|wind]], [[hydropower|hydraulic]], [[biomass]]). It was supervised by the Ministry for Industry and by the Ministry for Research. When it was discontinued, its duties were taken up by the French Agency for the Environment and Energy Management, ADEME.

The first Managing Director and Chief Executive of ComES was M. Henry Durand, an engineer.

As a national agency, COMES defined, financed and evaluated projects using renewable energies. Shortly after this agency was created, its Department of International Affairs was set up (by [[Jean-Jacques Subrenat]], a career diplomat), and became involved in a number of projects, both multilateral and in the context of bilateral relations between [[France]] and partner countries.

A new distribution of tasks among public agencies led to the French Solar Energy Authority being discontinued: its tasks were taken over, and expanded, by the [[Agence de l'Environnement et de la Maîtrise de l'Energie]] (ADEME) which, compared with its predecessors, has a wider purview which includes the environment.

[[File:Design model for the Coal Exchange, London, 1847.jpg|thumb|[[James Bunstone Bunning]]'s design model for the Coal Exchange, held by the [[Royal Institute of British Architects]] and displayed by the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]].]]

The '''London Coal Exchange''' was situated on the north side of [[Thames Street (London)|Thames Street]] in the [[City of London]], nearly opposite to [[Old Billingsgate Market]], occupying three different structures from 1770 to 1962.  The original coal exchange opened in 1770.  A second building from 1805 was replaced by a new purpose-built structure constructed from 1847 to 1849, and opened by [[Albert, Prince Consort|Prince Albert]] on 30 October 1849.  This third London coal exchange was one of the first substantial buildings constructed from [[cast iron]], built several years before the hall at the [[Great Exhibition]].  It was demolished in 1962 to allow widening of what is now [[Lower Thames Street]] despite a campaign by the [[Victorian Society]] to save the building.  Cast iron decorations from the 1849 Coal Exchange building were selected as the model for the [[dragon boundary mark]] for the main entrances to the City of London.

==Background==
{{see|Coal-tax post}}
[[File:Coalexchange.png|thumb|Exterior of the 1849 London Coal Exchange, c.1844, from [[Edward Mogg|Mogg]]'s New Picture of London and Visitor's Guide to its Sights]]
[[Coal]] had been imported to London by sea since at least medieval times.  A coal exchange was established in 1770 on Thames Street in the City of London, near the site of [[Smart's Quay]] and close to Billingsgate Market; the main trades at Billingsgate Dock were fish and coal.  The market was established by the main [[coal merchant]]s as a private body to regulate the trade of coal in the capital, and was controlled by private coal merchants until the old Coal Exchange was bought by the [[Corporation of the City of London|Corporation of London]] in 1807.  A new building had been built in 1805, with a recessed classical portico supported by small [[Doric order|Doric]] pillars and triangular pediment above, with stone steps leading to a quadrangle within.  Under the control of the City Corporation, the Coal Exchange became a free and open market, regulated by various Acts of Parliament, including Acts in 1831, 1838 and 1845.

At this period, London was heated almost entirely by coal.  By 1848, approximately 3.5 million tons of coal was being transported each year from the coalfields in Northumberland and Durham to London, with over 12,000 shiploads carried on nearly 3,000 vessels. The coal trade was also an important source of tax revenue for the city. The duty on coal funded Wren's rebuilding of more than [[Commission for Building Fifty New Churches|fifty city churches]] and [[St Paul's Cathedral]] after the [[Great Fire of London]] in 1666, and also funded for other building works in the metropolis, such as the [[Thames Embankment]].

Historically, coal taxes ([[metage]], payable on each [[chaldron]] of 35 [[bushel]]s or the [[imperial ton]]) were charged by the City based on volume measurements. A coal duty of 4 pence was confirmed by [[James I]], with a duty of 8 pence more added under [[William III of England|William III]] and [[Mary II of England|Mary II]], and an additional 1 pence added to fund the construction of the new Coal Exchange. From 1831, the City of London charged a duty of 13 pence per imperial ton before coal could be unshipped, and a certificate was sent to the Coal Exchange stating the date of shipment, name and owner of the ship, quantity of coal, where it was mined, and the price paid. The coal trade was dominated by sea transport until 1845, but railway transportation increased in importance in the 1850s and 1860s, with similar quantities carried on the rails, and the coal duty was extended to coal brought within 20 miles of London by any means in 1862. By 1875, five million tons of coal were being brought to London each year by rail and three million tons by sea.

Thousands of workmen of various grades were employed to move the coal from the ships to a customer's coal cellar, with "coal-whippers" carrying sacks of coal by hand from a ship to a coal merchant's [[lighter]], and then taken onshore by "coal-backers".  The coal was sorted by "coal-sifter" and put into coal-sacks by a "coal-filler", then transported by "coal-waggoners" and delivered by a "coal-trimmer".  The work was heavy manual labour, but the trade was essential and workers were reasonably well paid for the period.

In the Coal Exchange, coal factors acted as agents between sellers and buyers. Factors agreed with coal sellers how much coal is available on a particular day, based on the ships available and the market price, with the market meeting on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays from 12 noon to 2:30&amp;nbsp;pm.  All sales were agreed privately, with no public auction, and factors would take a 0.5% commission.

By 1845, a petition was made to build a new exchange, and the City Clerk of Works, [[James Bunstone Bunning]], produced a design.  Construction started in December 1847 and the new Coal Exchange was formally opened by [[Albert, Prince Consort|Prince Albert]] on 30 October 1849.&lt;ref name=coalexchange&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.victorianlondon.org/buildings/coalexchange.htm|title=Victorian London - Buildings, Monuments and Museums - Coal Exchange|website=www.victorianlondon.org|accessdate=7 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Lord Mayor and City MP, [[Sir James Duke, 1st Baronet|James Duke]], was made a baronet in honour of the occasion.

==Description==
[[File:Microcosm of London Plate 017 - The Coal Exchange (tone).jpg|thumb|Interior of the 1805 London Coal Exchange. C.1808]]
The new Coal Exchange was built on the north side of [[Thames Street (London)|Thames Street]], on the east side of its junction with [[St. Mary-at-Hill]], with four floors.&lt;ref name=coalexchange/&gt;  A [[Roman London|Roman]] [[hypocaust]] was found during the excavation of the building's foundations, part of the [[Roman house at Billingsgate]], and preserved in its basement and is now a [[scheduled ancient monument]].

The south and west fronts, facing the streets, were built in [[Italianate architecture|Italianate style]] from [[Portland stone]], with four floors, measuring {{convert|112|ft|m}} wide and {{convert|61|ft|m}} high. At the southwest corner was an unusual high semi-circular portico with [[Doric order|Doric]] columns and [[entablature]], surmounted by a tower of [[Portland stone]] {{convert|109|ft}} high, with a conical roof topped by a gilt ball.  Within the tower was a staircase providing access to the upper floors.  The ground floor portico provided access to an entrance vestibule leading to a large central circular vaulted hall.  The central rotunda was {{convert|60|ft|m}} in diameter, with a wooden floor inlaid with a large mariner's compass.  The rotunda was covered by a glazed cast iron dome with its centre {{convert|74|ft|m}} above the ground, held up by 8 cast iron piers, supported by 32 ribs 42&amp;nbsp;ft 6in long.&lt;ref name=coalexchange/&gt;

The dome design was based on that of the [[Bourse de commerce (Paris)|Bourse de commerce of Paris]] by [[François-Joseph Bélanger]] and François Brunet, completed in 1811.{{sfn|Bourse de Commerce – Structurae}} The dome was decorated with "[[Raphael]]esque" [[Encaustic tile|encaustic]] panels by [[Frederick Sang]] on a coal-related theme, depicting fossils of ferns, palms and other plants, and images of collieries and mining operations, and views of North Shields, Sunderland, Newcastle upon Tyne and Durham together, with cast iron decorative features.  The piers also supported three tiers of cast iron galleries which opened on to offices around the exterior of the building which were occupied by coal factors and other agents and merchants connected with the coal trade.

==Demolition==
The building suffered some damage in the Second World War, and it ceased to be used as a coal exchange after the war when [[National Coal Board|the coal industry was nationalised]].  It was then used as offices, but the City of London did not proceed with plans to refurbish the building in the 1950s because its demolition had been suggested to allow widening of the road from [[Blackfriars, London|Blackfriars]] to the [[East End]], and it became progressively more dilapidated.  Nonetheless, in the 1950s, Professor [[Richard Hitchcock]] described it as "the prime city monument of the early Victorian period".  In September 1956, [[John Betjeman]] (a founding member of the [[Victorian Society]] and a passionate defender of [[Victorian architecture]]) gave a speech to the [[Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings]] in the rotunda of the Coal Exchange to argue for its preservation.  It became a Grade 2 [[listed building]] in 1958.  A letter published in ''The Times'' and signed by [[Walter Gropius]], [[Sigfried Giedion]], [[Josep Lluís Sert]] and [[Eduard Sekler]] described the Coal Exchange as "a landmark in the history of early iron construction".

Various alternatives were proposed.  The [[Georgian Group]] and the Victorian Society both favoured preservation of the Coal Exchange, even if that meant that the "very dull, plain and ordinary" rear parts of the nearby [[Grade-1 listed]] [[Custom House, City of London|Custom House]] (then the headquarters of [[HM Customs &amp; Excise]]) were removed.  Others suggested a scheme in which a walkway would be added in arches under the Coal Exchange.  There was also a suggestion that the dome could become part of the new [[Royal School of Music]] in [[Barbican Centre|the Barbican]], or shipped to Australia to become part of the [[National Gallery of Victoria]] in Melbourne, but funds were not available.

MP [[Tom Driberg]] made a speech in an adjournment debate in February 1961, quoting a statement by Sir [[Mortimer Wheeler]] published in ''The Times'' the previous day, saying that "[[Nikolaus Pevsner|Professor Pevsner]] has placed the threatened London Coal Exchange among the twelve irreplaceable buildings of 19th century England ... It expresses an era of urban revolution as no other surviving building is capable of doing ... The Coal Exchange is a national monument in the fullest sense of the phrase, and its destruction would be unforgivable."

The Corporation was uncooperative, and declined to allow any respite. One member remarked that "We cannot spend time on the preservation of a Victorian building".{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}
 
Despite campaigns and protests, it was demolished in November 1962 to make way for a "vital" widening of Lower Thames Street.  The demolition of the Coal Exchange was described by author [[Hermione Hobhouse]] as "one of the great conservationist horror stories" and its loss has been compared to the demolition of [[Adelphi, London|the Adelphi]] in 1936 and of [[Euston Arch]] shortly before, in 1961.  The cleared site was then left empty for 10 years while other land was acquired for the road widening scheme.

Cast iron dragons which were mounted on the eaves parapet above the entrance to the Coal Exchange were preserved and were erected as [[dragon boundary mark]]s in October 1963 in [[Temple, London|Temple Gardens]] on [[Victoria Embankment]].  Half-sized replicas were erected at the other main entrances to the City, in preference to the more fierce dragon at [[Temple Bar, London|Temple Bar]].

{{Infobox cobalt}}
'''Cobalt''' is a [[chemical element]] with symbol '''Co''' and atomic number 27. Like nickel, cobalt is found in the Earth's crust only in chemically combined form, save for small deposits found in alloys of natural [[meteoric iron]]. The free element, produced by reductive [[smelting]], is a hard, lustrous, silver-gray [[metal]].

Cobalt-based blue pigments ([[cobalt blue]]) have been used since ancient times for jewelry and paints, and to impart a distinctive blue tint to glass, but the color was later thought by alchemists to be due to the known metal [[bismuth]]. Miners had long used the name ''[[kobold]] ore'' (German for ''goblin ore'') for some of the blue-pigment producing [[minerals]]; they were so named because they were poor in known metals, and gave poisonous [[arsenic]]-containing fumes when smelted. In 1735, such ores were found to be reducible to a new metal (the first discovered since ancient times), and this was ultimately named for the ''kobold''.

Today, some cobalt is produced specifically from one of a number of metallic-lustered ores, such as for example [[cobaltite]] (Co[[Arsenic|As]][[Sulfur|S]]). The element is however more usually produced as a by-product of [[copper]] and [[nickel]] mining. [[Copperbelt|The copper belt]] in the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] (DRC) and [[Zambia]] yields most of the global cobalt production. The DRC alone accounted for more than 50% of world production in 2016 (123,000 tonnes), according to [[Natural Resources Canada]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Electric car future spurs Cobalt rush: Swelling demand for product breathes new life into small Ontario town|author=Danielle Bochove |work=Vancouver Sun|date=November 1, 2017|agency=Bloomberg}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cobalt is primarily used in the manufacture of [[magnetism|magnetic]], wear-resistant and high-strength [[alloy]]s. The compounds cobalt silicate and [[Cobalt blue|cobalt(II) aluminate]] (CoAl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, cobalt blue) give a distinctive deep blue color to [[glass]], [[ceramic]]s, [[ink]]s, [[paint]]s and [[varnish]]es. Cobalt occurs naturally as only one stable [[isotope]], cobalt-59. [[Cobalt-60]] is a commercially important radioisotope, used as a [[radioactive tracer]] and for the production of high energy [[gamma ray]]s.

Cobalt is the active center of a group of [[coenzymes]] called [[cobalamin]]s. [[Vitamin B12|vitamin B{{ssub|12}}]], the best-known example of the type, is an essential [[vitamin]] for all animals. Cobalt in inorganic form is also a [[micronutrient]] for [[bacteria]], [[algae]], and [[fungi]].

Cobalt is a weakly reducing metal that is protected from oxidation by a [[Passivation (chemistry)|passivating]] [[oxide]] film. It is attacked by [[halogens]] and [[sulfur]]. Heating in [[oxygen]] produces [[Cobalt(II,III) oxide|Co&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]] which loses oxygen at {{convert|900|C}} to give the [[Cobalt(II) oxide|monoxide]] CoO.&lt;ref name="HollemanAF"/&gt; The metal reacts with [[fluorine]] ([[Fluorine|F&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]]) at 520&amp;nbsp;K to give [[Cobalt(III) fluoride|CoF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]]; with [[chlorine]] ([[Chlorine|Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]]), [[bromine]] ([[Bromine|Br&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]]) and [[iodine]] ([[Iodine|I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]]), producing equivalent binary [[halides]]. It does not react with [[hydrogen gas]] ([[hydrogen|H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]]) or [[nitrogen gas]] ([[nitrogen|N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]]) even when heated, but it does react with [[boron]], [[carbon]], [[phosphorus]], [[arsenic]] and sulfur.&lt;ref&gt;{{Housecroft3rd|page=722}}&lt;/ref&gt; At ordinary temperatures, it reacts slowly with [[mineral acids]], and very slowly with moist, but not with dry, air.

==Compounds==
{{Category see also|Cobalt compounds}}
Common [[oxidation states]] of cobalt include +2 and +3, although compounds with oxidation states ranging from −3 to [[percobaltate|+5]] are also known. A common oxidation state for simple compounds is +2 (cobalt(II)).  These salts form the pink-colored [[metal aquo complex]] [Co(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; in water. Addition of chloride gives the intensely blue {{chem|[CoCl|4|]|2-}}.&lt;ref name=greenwood/&gt; In a borax bead [[flame test]], cobalt shows deep blue in both oxidizing and reducing flames.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7tfyCAAAQBAJ|title=Rutley’s Elements of Mineralogy|last=Rutley|first=Frank|date=2012-12-06|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=9789401197694|page=40|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Oxygen and chalcogen compounds===
Several [[oxide]]s of cobalt are known. Green [[cobalt(II) oxide]] (CoO) has [[Cubic crystal system|rocksalt]] structure. It is readily oxidized with water and oxygen to brown cobalt(III) hydroxide (Co(OH)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;). At temperatures of 600–700&amp;nbsp;°C, CoO oxidizes to the blue [[cobalt(II,III) oxide]] (Co&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;), which has a [[spinel]] structure.&lt;ref name=greenwood&gt;{{Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw2nd|pages=1117–1119}}&lt;/ref&gt; Black [[cobalt(III) oxide]] (Co&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) is also known.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=107|title=The history and use of our earth's chemical elements: a reference guide|author=Krebs, Robert E.|edition=2nd|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|date=2006|isbn=0-313-33438-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cobalt oxides are [[antiferromagnetic]] at low [[temperature]]: CoO ([[Néel temperature]] 291&amp;nbsp;K) and Co&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (Néel temperature: 40&amp;nbsp;K), which is analogous to [[magnetite]] (Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;), with a mixture of +2 and +3 oxidation states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Petitto|first1=Sarah C.|last2=Marsh|first2=Erin M.|last3=Carson|first3=Gregory A.|last4=Langell|first4=Marjorie A.|title=Cobalt oxide surface chemistry: The interaction of CoO(100), Co3O4(110) and Co3O4(111) with oxygen and water|url=http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1021&amp;context=chemistrylangell|journal=Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical|volume=281|pages=49–58|date=2008|doi=10.1016/j.molcata.2007.08.023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The principal [[chalcogen]]ides of cobalt include the black [[cobalt(II) sulfide]]s, CoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, which adopts a [[pyrite]]-like structure, and [[cobalt sulfide|cobalt(III) sulfide]] (Co&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;).

===Halides===
[[File:Cobalt(II)-chloride-hexahydrate-sample.jpg|thumb|left|alt=purple pile of power of Cobalt(II)-chloride-hexahydrate| Cobalt(II) chloride hexahydrate]]
Four [[:wikt:dihalide|dihalide]]s of cobalt(II) are known: [[cobalt(II) fluoride]] (CoF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, pink), [[cobalt(II) chloride]] (CoCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, blue), [[cobalt(II) bromide]] (CoBr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, green), [[cobalt(II) iodide]] (CoI&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, blue-black). These halides exist in anhydrous and hydrated forms. Whereas the anhydrous dichloride is blue, the hydrate is red.&lt;ref name=greenwood2&gt;{{Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw2nd|pages=1119–1120}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The reduction potential for the reaction {{chem|Co|3+}} + e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; → {{chem|Co|2+}} is +1.92&amp;nbsp;V, beyond that for [[chlorine]] to chloride, +1.36&amp;nbsp;V. Consequently, cobalt(III) and chloride would result in the cobalt(III) being reduced to cobalt(II). Because the reduction potential for fluorine to fluoride is so high, +2.87&amp;nbsp;V, [[cobalt(III) fluoride]] is one of the few simple stable cobalt(III) compounds. Cobalt(III) fluoride, which is used in some fluorination reactions, reacts vigorously with water.&lt;ref name="HollemanAF"/&gt;

===Coordination compounds===
As for all metals, molecular compounds and polyatomic ions of cobalt are classified as [[coordination complex]]es, that is, molecules or ions that contain cobalt linked to several [[ligand]]s. The principles of [[electronegativity]] and [[HSAB theory|hardness–softness]] of a series of ligands can be used to explain the usual oxidation state of cobalt. For example, Co&lt;sup&gt;+3&lt;/sup&gt; complexes tend to have [[ammine]] ligands. Because phosphorus is softer than nitrogen, phosphine ligands tend to feature the [[HSAB theory|softer]] Co&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and Co&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, an example being tris(triphenylphosphine)cobalt(I) chloride ((P(C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CoCl). The more electronegative (and harder) oxide and fluoride can stabilize Co&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt; and Co&lt;sup&gt;5+&lt;/sup&gt; derivatives, e.g. caesium hexafluorocobaltate (Cs&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CoF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;) and potassium [[percobaltate]] (K&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CoO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;).&lt;ref name="HollemanAF"&gt;{{cite book|author=Holleman, A.

[[Alfred Werner]], a Nobel-prize winning pioneer in [[coordination chemistry]], worked with compounds of [[empirical formula]] [Co(NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]Cl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. One of the isomers determined was [[cobalt(III) hexammine chloride]]. This coordination complex, a typical Werner-type complex, consists of a central cobalt atom coordinated by six [[ammine]] orthogonal ligands and three [[chloride]] counteranions. Using [[chelation|chelating]] [[ethylenediamine]] ligands in place of ammonia gives [[tris(ethylenediamine)cobalt(III) chloride]] ([Co(en)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]Cl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), which was one of the first [[coordination complex]]es to be resolved into [[Chirality (chemistry)|optical isomers]]. The complex exists in the right- and left-handed forms of a "three-bladed propeller". This complex was first isolated by Werner as yellow-gold needle-like crystals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author = Werner, A. |title = Zur Kenntnis des asymmetrischen Kobaltatoms.

Twenty-two [[radioisotope]]s have been characterized; the most stable, [[Cobalt-60|&lt;sup&gt;60&lt;/sup&gt;Co]] has a [[half-life]] of 5.2714&amp;nbsp;years, and &lt;sup&gt;57&lt;/sup&gt;Co has a half-life of 271.8&amp;nbsp;days, &lt;sup&gt;56&lt;/sup&gt;Co a half-life of 77.27&amp;nbsp;days, and &lt;sup&gt;58&lt;/sup&gt;Co a half-life of 70.86&amp;nbsp;days. All the other [[radioactive]] isotopes of cobalt have half-lives shorter than 18&amp;nbsp;hours, and in most cases shorter than 1&amp;nbsp;second.

Cobalt compounds have been used for centuries to impart a rich blue color to [[glass]], [[ceramic glaze|glazes]], and [[Ceramics (art)|ceramics]]. Cobalt has been detected in Egyptian sculpture, Persian jewelry from the third millennium BC, in the ruins of [[Pompeii]], destroyed in 79 AD, and in China, dating from the [[Tang dynasty]] (618–907 AD) and the [[Ming dynasty]] (1368–1644 AD).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/123235/cobalt-Co Cobalt], Encyclopædia Britannica Online.&lt;/ref&gt;

The word ''cobalt'' is derived from the German ''{{lang|mhd|kobalt}}'', from ''[[kobold]]'' meaning "goblin", a superstitious term used for the [[ore]] of cobalt by miners. The first attempts to smelt those ores for copper or nickel failed, yielding simply powder (cobalt(II) oxide) instead. Because the primary ores of cobalt always contain arsenic, smelting the ore oxidized the arsenic into the highly toxic and volatile [[arsenic(III) oxide|arsenic oxide]], adding to the notoriety of the ore.&lt;ref name="met1863" &gt;{{cite book|isbn = 978-0-202-36361-5|pages =254–256|chapter = Cobalt|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=UyE49SzKWHIC&amp;pg=PA254|title = Metallurgy: 1863–1963|author1 = Dennis, W.

After World War II, the US wanted to guarantee the supply of cobalt ore for military uses (as the Germans had been doing) and prospected for cobalt within the U.S. border. An adequate supply of the ore was found in Idaho near [[Blackbird Mine|Blackbird canyon]] in the side of a mountain. The firm Calera Mining Company started production at the site.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=kNwDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA65&amp;dq=true#v=onepage&amp;q=true&amp;f=true "Richest Hole In The Mountain"] ''Popular Mechanics'', May 1952, pp. 65–69.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Occurrence==
The stable form of cobalt is produced in [[supernova]]s through the [[r-process]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|bibcode = 1980SvAL....6...61P|title=Creation of the Iron-Group Elements in a Supernova Explosion|author=Ptitsyn, D. A.|author2=Chechetkin, V. M.|journal=Soviet Astronomy Letters|volume= 6|date=1980|pages=61–64}}&lt;/ref&gt; It comprises [[Abundance of the chemical elements|0.0029% of the Earth's crust]]. Free cobalt (the [[native metal]]) is not found on Earth because of the oxygen in the atmosphere and the chlorine in the ocean. Both are abundant enough in the upper layers of the Earth's crust to prevent native metal cobalt from forming. Except as recently delivered in meteoric iron, pure cobalt in native metal form is unknown on Earth. The element has a medium abundance but natural compounds of cobalt are numerous and all amounts of cobalt compounds are found in most rocks, soil, plants, and animals.

In nature, cobalt is frequently associated with [[nickel]]. Both are characteristic components of [[meteoric iron]], though cobalt is much less abundant in iron meteorites than nickel. As with nickel, cobalt in meteoric iron [[alloy]]s may have been well enough protected from oxygen and moisture to remain as the free (but alloyed) metal,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://rruff.info/rdsmi/V35/RDSMI35_355.pdf |title=Determination of metallic iron, nickel and cobalt in meteorites |author=Nuccio, Pasquale Mario and Valenza, Mariano |year=1979 |journal=Rendiconti Societa Italiana di Mineralogia e Petrografia |volume=35 |issue=1 |pages=355–360}}&lt;/ref&gt; though neither element is seen in that form in the ancient terrestrial crust.

Cobalt in compound form occurs in copper and nickel minerals. It is the major metallic component that combines with [[sulfur]] and arsenic in the sulfidic [[cobaltite]] (CoAsS), [[safflorite]] (CoAs&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), [[glaucodot]] ((Co,Fe)AsS), and [[skutterudite]] (CoAs&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) minerals.&lt;ref name="HollemanAF"/&gt; The mineral [[cattierite]] is similar to [[pyrite]] and occurs together with [[vaesite]] in the copper deposits of [[Katanga Province]].&lt;ref&gt;

The main ores of cobalt are [[cobaltite]], erythrite, [[glaucodot]] and [[skutterudite]] (see above), but most cobalt is obtained by reducing the cobalt [[by-product]]s of nickel and [[copper]] mining and [[smelting]].&lt;ref name="YB2006"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/cobalt/myb1-2006-cobal.pdf|first = Kim B.|last = Shedd|accessdate = 2008-10-26|title = Mineral Yearbook 2006: Cobalt|publisher = United States Geological Survey}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CR2008"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/cobalt/mcs-2008-cobal.pdf|first = Kim B.|last = Shedd|accessdate = 2008-10-26|title = Commodity Report 2008: Cobalt|publisher = United States Geological Survey}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since cobalt is generally produced as a by-product, the supply of cobalt depends to a great extent on the economic feasibility of copper and  nickel mining in a given market. Demand for cobalt was projected to grow 6% in 2017.&lt;ref name=ft&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.ft.com/content/bc8dc13c-07db-11e7-97d1-5e720a26771b|title=Cobalt’s meteoric rise at risk from Congo’s Katanga|author=Henry Sanderson |date=March 14, 2017|publisher=Financial Times | url-access=limited}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several methods exist to separate cobalt from copper and nickel, depending on the concentration of cobalt and the exact composition of the used [[ore]]. One method is [[froth flotation]], in which [[surfactant]]s bind to different ore components, leading to an enrichment of cobalt ores. Subsequent [[roasting (metallurgy)|roasting]] converts the ores to [[cobalt sulfate]], and the copper and the iron are oxidized to the oxide. [[Leaching (metallurgy)|Leaching]] with water extracts the sulfate together with the [[arsenate]]s. The residues are further leached with [[sulfuric acid]], yielding a solution of copper sulfate. Cobalt can also be leached from the [[slag]] of copper smelting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page = 347| title = ASM specialty handbook: nickel, cobalt, and their alloys| author =Davis, Joseph R.|publisher = ASM International| date = 2000| isbn = 0-87170-685-7| url = https://books.google.com/?id=IePhmnbmRWkC&amp;dq=cobalt+copper+nickel+ore+separate}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The products of the above-mentioned processes are transformed into the cobalt oxide (Co&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;). This oxide is reduced to metal by the [[aluminothermic reaction]] or reduction with carbon in a [[blast furnace]].&lt;ref name="HollemanAF"/&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] (DRC) currently produces 63% of the world’s cobalt. This market share may reach 73% by 2025 if planned expansions by mining producers like [[Glencore]] Plc take place as expected. But by 2030, global demand could be 47 times more than it was in 2017, Bloomberg New Energy Finance has estimated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=We’ll All Be Relying on Congo to Power Our Electric Cars |author=Thomas Wilson |date=October 26, 2017|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-10-26/battery-boom-relies-on-one-african-nation-avoiding-chaos-of-past |archive-url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-10-26/battery-boom-relies-on-one-african-nation-avoiding-chaos-of-past |archive-date=March 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Changes that Congo made to mining laws in 2002 led did attract investment in Congolese copper and cobalt projects. However Glencore dominates the coltan market in DRC. Its Mutanda mine shipped 24,500 tons of cobalt from its Mutanda mine last year, 40% of Congo DRC’s output and nearly a quarter of global production. T Glencore’s Katanga Mining project is resuming as well and should produce 300,000 tons of copper and 20,000 tons of cobalt by 2019, according to Glencore.&lt;ref name=ft/&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; By 2015, Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) supplied 60% of world cobalt production, 32,000 tons at $20,000 to $26,000 per ton. Recent growth in production could at least partly be due to how low mining production fell during DRC Congo's very violent civil wars in the early 2000s, or to the changes the country made to its Mining Code in 2002 to encourage foreign and multinational investment and which did bring in a number of investors, including [[Glencore]]. Three of its current Congo projects

The political and ethnic dynamics of the region have in the past caused horrific outbreaks of violence and years of armed conflict and displaced populations. This instability affected the price of cobalt and also created perverse incentives for the combattants in the First and Second Congo Wars to prolong the fighting, since access to diamond mines and other valuable resources helped to finance their military goals—which frequently amounteed to genocide—and also enriched the fighters themselves. While DR Congo has in the 2010s not recently been invaded by neighboring military forces, some of the richest mineral deposits adjoin areas where Tutsis and Hutus still frequently clash, unrest continues although on a smaller scale and refugees still flee outbreaks of violence.&lt;ref&gt;

Cobalt extracted from small Congolese [[artisanal mining]] endeavors in 2007 supplied a single Chinese company, Congo DongFang International Mining. A subsidiary of [[Zhejiang Huayou Cobalt]], one of the world’s largest cobalt producers, Congo DongFang supplied cobalt to some of the world’s largest battery manufacturers, who produced batteries for ubiquitous products like the Apple [[iPhone]]s. Corporate pieties about an ethical [[supply chain]] were thus met with some incredulity. A number of observers have called for tech corporations and other manufacturers to avoid sourcing conflict metals in Central Africa at all rather than risk enabling the financial exploitation, [[human rights]] abuses like kidnappings for [[unfree labor]], environmental devastation and the human toll of violence, poverty and toxic conditions.

The [[Mukondo Mountain]] project, operated by the [[Central African Mining and Exploration Company]] (CAMEC) in [[Katanga Province]], may be the richest cobalt reserve in the world. It produced an estimated one third of the total global coval production in 2008.&lt;ref name=IntMining200807&gt;

In 2017, some exploration companies were planning to survey old silver and cobalt mines in the area of [[Cobalt, Ontario]] where significant deposits are believed to lie.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2017-10-31/the-canadian-ghost-town-that-tesla-is-bringing-back-to-life The Canadian Ghost Town That Tesla Is Bringing Back to Life].

==Applications==
Cobalt has been used in production of high-performance alloys.&lt;ref name="YB2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CR2008"/&gt; It can also be used to make rechargeable batteries, and the advent of electric vehicles and their success with consumers probably has a great deal to do with the DRC's soaring production. Other important factors were the 2002 Mining Code, which encouraged investment by foreign and transnational corporations such as Glencore, and the end of the First and Second Congo Wars.

===Alloys===
Cobalt-based [[superalloy]]s have historically consumed most of the cobalt produced.&lt;ref name="YB2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CR2008"/&gt; The temperature stability of these alloys makes them suitable for turbine blades for [[gas turbine]]s and aircraft [[jet engine]]s, although nickel-based [[single-crystal]] alloys surpass them in performance.&lt;ref name="super"&gt;

===Catalysts===
Several cobalt compounds are oxidation catalysts. Cobalt acetate is used to convert [[xylene]] to [[terephthalic acid]], the precursor of the bulk polymer [[polyethylene terephthalate]]. Typical catalysts are the cobalt [[carboxylate]]s (known as cobalt soaps). They are also used in paints, varnishes, and inks as "drying agents" through the oxidation of [[drying oils]].&lt;ref name="WhyCo"/&gt; The same carboxylates are used to improve the adhesion between steel and rubber in steel-belted radial tires. In addition they are used as accelerators in [[polyester resin]] systems.

Cobalt-based catalysts are used in reactions involving [[carbon monoxide]]. Cobalt is also a catalyst in the [[Fischer–Tropsch process]] for the [[hydrogenation]] of carbon monoxide into liquid fuels.&lt;ref&gt;

It was discovered that the volcanic soils lacked the cobalt salts essential for the cattle food chain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sci.waikato.ac.nz/farm/content/soils.html#bush_sickness |title=Soils |publisher=Waikato University |accessdate= 2012-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=McDoewel&gt;{{cite book |last1=McDowell |first1=Lee Russell |title=Vitamins in Animal and Human Nutrition |date=2008 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |location=Hoboken |isbn=9780470376683 |page=525 |edition=2nd |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UR9MnQ806LsC&amp;pg=PA525}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "coast disease" of sheep in the [[Ninety Mile Desert]] of the [[Limestone Coast|Southeast]] of [[South Australia]] in the 1930s was found to originate in nutritional deficiencies of trace elements cobalt and copper. The cobalt deficiency was overcome by the development of "cobalt bullets", dense pellets of cobalt oxide mixed with clay given orally for lodging in the animal's [[rumen]].{{clarify|date=March 2018}}&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asap.unimelb.edu.au/bsparcs/aasmemoirs/marston.htm Australian Academy of Science &gt; Deceased Fellows &gt; Hedley Ralph Marston 1900–1965] Accessed 12 May 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=McDoewel/&gt;

Proteins based on cobalamin use [[corrin]] to hold the cobalt. Coenzyme B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; features a reactive C-Co bond that participates in the reactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Voet, Judith G. |author2=Voet, Donald |title=Biochemistry |publisher=J.

[[Methylcobalamin|MeB&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;]] promotes methyl (−CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) group transfers. The adenosyl version of B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; catalyzes rearrangements in which a hydrogen atom is directly transferred between two adjacent atoms with concomitant exchange of the second substituent, X, which may be a carbon atom with substituents, an oxygen atom of an alcohol, or an amine. [[Methylmalonyl coenzyme A mutase]] (MUT) converts [[L-methylmalonyl-CoA|MMl-CoA]] to [[succinyl-CoA|Su-CoA]], an important step in the extraction of energy from proteins and fats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1 = Smith |first1 = David M. |last2 = Golding |first2 = Bernard T. |last3 = Radom |first3 = Leo |title = Understanding the Mechanism of B12-Dependent Methylmalonyl-CoA Mutase: Partial Proton Transfer in Action |journal = Journal of the American Chemical Society |volume = 121 |pages = 9388–9399 |date = 1999 |doi = 10.1021/ja991649a |issue = 40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although far less common than other [[metalloprotein]]s (e.g. those of zinc and iron), other cobaltoproteins are known besides B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;.

Cobalt is an essential element for life in minute amounts. The [[Median lethal dose|LD&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;]] value for soluble cobalt salts has been estimated to be between 150 and 500&amp;nbsp;mg/kg.&lt;ref name=Ullmann&gt;Donaldson, John D. and Beyersmann, Detmar (2005) "Cobalt and Cobalt Compounds" in ''Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry'', Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. {{DOI|10.1002/14356007.a07_281.pub2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the US, the [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] (OSHA) has designated a [[permissible exposure limit]] (PEL) in the workplace as a time-weighted average (TWA) of 0.1&amp;nbsp;mg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. The [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] (NIOSH) has set a [[recommended exposure limit]] (REL) of 0.05&amp;nbsp;mg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, time-weighted average. The [[IDLH]] (immediately dangerous to life and health) value is 20&amp;nbsp;mg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{PGCH|0146}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, chronic cobalt ingestion has caused serious health problems at doses far less than the lethal dose. In 1966, the addition of cobalt compounds to stabilize [[beer foam]] in Canada led to a peculiar form of toxin-induced [[cardiomyopathy]], which came to be known as ''beer drinker's cardiomyopathy''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Morin Y |author2= Tětu A |author3= Mercier G|title=Quebec beer-drinkers' cardiomyopathy: Clinical and hemodynamic aspects |journal=Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences |volume=156 |issue= 1 |pages=566–576 |date=1969|pmid=5291148  |doi=10.1111/j.1749-6632.1969.tb16751.x|bibcode = 1969NYASA.156..566M }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title = Cobalt|author = Barceloux, Donald G.|author2 = Barceloux, Donald|last-author-amp = yes |doi = 10.1081/CLT-100102420|journal = Clinical Toxicology|volume = 37|issue = 2|date = 1999| pages = 201–216}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Protective relay.jpg|thumb|Protective relay]]
In utility and industrial [[electric power transmission]] and [[Electricity distribution|distribution]] systems, a '''digital protective relay''' is a computer-based system with software-based protection [[algorithm]]s for the detection of electrical [[Fault (power engineering)|faults]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Schweitzer Programmable Automation Controller|url=https://www.selinc.com/SEL-2411/|publisher=Schweitzer Engineering Laboratories|accessdate=21 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such relays are also termed as [[microprocessor]] type protective relays. They are functional replacements for electro-mechanical [[protective relay]]s and may include many protection functions in one unit, as well as providing metering, communication, and self-test functions.

== Description and definition ==
The digital protective [[relay]] is a [[protective relay]] that uses a [[microprocessor]] to analyze power system voltages, currents or other process quantities for the purpose of detection of faults in an electric power system or industrial process system.  A digital protective relay may also be called a "numeric protective relay". It is also called numerical relay.

===Input processing===
Low [[voltage]] and low [[Electric current|current]] signals (i.e., at the secondary of a [[Transformer types#Voltage transformers|voltage transformers]] and [[current transformer]]s) are brought into a [[low pass filter]] that removes [[frequency]] content above about 1/3 of the [[sampling frequency]] (a relay [[A/D converter]] needs to sample faster than twice per cycle of the highest frequency that it is to monitor). The [[Alternating current|AC]] signal is then sampled by the relay's analog to digital converter from 4 to 64 (varies by relay) samples per power system cycle.  As a minimum, magnitude of the incoming quantity, commonly using [[Fourier transform]] concepts ([[Root mean square|RMS]] and some form of averaging) would be used in a simple relay function. More advanced analysis can be used to determine [[phase angle]]s, [[AC power|power]], [[reactive power]], [[Electrical impedance|impedance]], [[waveform]] [[distortion]], and other [[complex system|complex]] quantities.

Only the fundamental component is needed for most protection algorithms, unless a high speed algorithm is used that uses subcycle data to monitor for fast changing issues. The sampled data is then passed through a low pass filter that numerically removes the frequency content that is above the [[fundamental frequency]] of interest (i.e., nominal system frequency), and uses Fourier transform algorithms to extract the fundamental frequency magnitude and angle.

===Logic processing===
The relay analyzes the resultant A/D converter outputs to determine if action is required under its protection algorithm(s). Protection algorithms are a set of logic equations in part designed by the protection engineer, and in part designed by the relay manufacturer.
The relay is capable of applying advanced logic. It is capable of analyzing whether the relay should trip or restrain from tripping based on parameters set by the user, compared against many functions of its [[analog signal|analogue]] inputs, relay contact inputs, timing and order of event sequences.

If a fault condition is detected, output contacts operate to trip the associated circuit breaker(s).

===Parameter setting===
The logic is user-configurable and can vary from simply changing front panel switches or moving of [[circuit board]] jumpers to accessing the relay's internal parameter setting webpage via communications link on another computer hundreds of kilometres away.

The relay may have an extensive collection of settings, beyond what can be entered via front panel knobs and dials, and these settings are transferred to the relay via an interface with a PC ([[personal computer]]), and this same PC interface may be used to collect event reports from the relay.

===Event recording===
In some relays, a short history of the entire sampled data is kept for oscillographic records. The event recording would include some means for the user to see the timing of key logic decisions, relay I/O (input/output) changes, and see, in an [[oscillograph]]ic fashion, at least the fundamental component of the incoming analogue parameters.

===Data display===
Digital/numerical relays provide a front panel display, or display on a terminal through a communication interface. This is used to display relay settings and real-time current/voltage values, etc.

More complex digital relays will have metering and communication protocol ports, allowing the relay to become an element in a [[SCADA]] system. Communication ports may include [[RS232]]/[[RS485]] or  [[Ethernet]] (copper or fibre-optic). Communication languages may include [[Modbus]], [[DNP3]] or [[IEC61850]] protocols.

==Comparison with other types==
[[File:Protective Relays Hydroelectric Station.JPG|thumb|Electromechanical protective relays at a hydroelectric generation station]]
By contrast, an electromechanical [[protective relay]] converts the voltages and currents to magnetic and electric forces and torques that press against spring tensions in the relay. The tension of the spring and taps on the electromagnetic coils in the relay are the main processes by which a user sets such a relay.

In a [[solid-state relay]], the incoming voltage and current wave-forms are monitored by analog circuits, not recorded or digitized. The analog values are compared to settings made by the user via [[potentiometer]]s in the relay, and in some case, taps on transformers.

In some solid-state relays, a simple [[microprocessor]] does some of the relay logic, but the logic is fixed and simple. For instance, in some time overcurrent solid state relays, the incoming AC current is first converted into a small signal AC value, then the AC is fed into a [[rectifier]] and filter that converts the [[Alternating current|AC]] to a [[Direct current|DC]] value proportionate to the AC waveform. An [[op-amp]] and comparator is used to create a DC that rises when a trip point is reached. Then a relatively simple microprocessor does a slow speed A/D conversion of the DC signal, integrates the results to create the time-overcurrent curve response, and trips when the integration rises above a set-point. Though this relay has a microprocessor, it lacks the attributes of a digital/numeric relay, and hence the term "microprocessor relay" is not a clear term.

==History==
The digital/numeric relay was invented by [[Edmund O. Schweitzer, III]] in the early 1980s. [[Schweitzer Engineering Laboratories|SEL]], [[AREVA]], and [[ABB Group]]'s were early forerunners making some of the early market advances in the arena, but the arena has become crowded today with many manufacturers. In transmission line and generator protection, by the mid-1990s the digital relay had nearly replaced the solid state and electro-mechanical relay in new construction. In distribution applications, the replacement by the digital relay proceeded a bit more slowly. While the great majority of feeder relays in new applications today are digital, the solid state relay still sees some use where simplicity of the application allows for simpler relays, which allows one to avoid the complexity of digital relays.

== Protective element types ==
Protective elements refer to the overall logic surrounding the electrical condition that is being monitored. For instance, a differential element refers to the logic required to monitor two (or more) currents, find their difference, and trip if the difference is beyond certain parameters. The term element and function are quite interchangeable in many instances.

For simplicity on one-line diagrams, the  protection function is usually identified by an [[ANSI]] device number.  In the era of electromechanical and solid state relays, any one relay could implement only one or two protective functions, so a complete protection system may have many relays on its panel. In a digital/numeric relay, many functions are implemented by the microprocessor programming. Any one numeric relay may implement one or all of these functions.

A listing of device numbers is found at [[ANSI Device Numbers]].
A summary of some common device numbers seen in digital relays is:
* 11&amp;nbsp;– Multi-function Device
* 21&amp;nbsp;– Impedance
* 24&amp;nbsp;– Volts/Hz
* 25&amp;nbsp;– Synchronizing

'''Emulsified Fuels''' are [[emulsions]] composed of water and a combustible liquid, either oil or a fuel. Emulsions are a particular example of a [[dispersion (chemistry)|dispersion]] comprising a continuous and a dispersed phase. In the case of emulsions both phases are the [[immiscible]] liquids, oil and water. Emulsion fuels can be either a [[microemulsion]] or an ordinary emulsion (sometimes referred to as [[macroemulsion]], to differentiate them from microemulsions).  The essential differences between the two are stability (microemulsions are thermodynamically stable systems, whereas macroemulsions are kinetically stabilized) and particle size distribution (microemulsions are formed spontaneously and have dimensions of 10 to 200&amp;nbsp;nm, whereas macroemulsions are formed by a shearing process and have dimensions of 100&amp;nbsp;nm to over 1 micrometer). Microemulsions are isotropic whereas macroemulsions are prone to [[settling]] (or [[creaming (chemistry)|creaming]]) and changes in particle size over time. Both use [[surfactants]] (also called emulsifiers) and can be either water-in-oil (invert emulsions), or oil-in-water (regular emulsions) or bicontinuous (also called multiple or complex emulsions).

==Applications==
Water continuous (oil-in-water) emulsified fuels are exemplified by the [[Orimulsion]] system and [[bitumen]] emulsions. These are often described as a high internal phase emulsions (hipe) because the continuous phase is around 30% of the composition of the fuel it is more usual for the dispersed phase to be the minor component. Water continuous emulsions of very heavy crudes, bitumen are easier to pump than the original fuel, which would require considerable heating and / or dilution with a distilled product (kerosene or light crude) in order to make them easy to handle. Water continuous emulsions of residual fuel, heavy fuel oils etc. which have a calorific value and are used in industrial applications can also be converted to emulsified fuels, thus reducing the need to use [[Cutting fluid|cutter fluids]] and improving the combustion emissions associated with the inferior fuels.

Oil continuous (water-in-oil) emulsified fuels are exemplified by diesel (or biodiesel blended fuels) and water emulsions,see: futrolaquapower.com (inactive website) These emulsified fuels were recognized in [[Europe]] ([[France]] and [[Italy]]) and CEN workshop standard was established (CWA 15145:2004). Other types of fuels have been emulsified contain between 5 and 30% water (by mass) in the overall fuel emulsion.

Microemulsions of fuels have also been prepared. The type of surfactants and quantities required to make these emulsion fuels sets them apart from other commercial emulsion fuels. These are considered where safety issues (e.g. fire prevention; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3F8edPltVc8 &lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3F8edPltVc8&lt;/ref&gt;) or commercial return justify the extra costs (e.g. enhance oil recovery, surfactant flooding; http://files.sc.akzonobel.com/bulletins/Enhanced%20Oil%20Recovery-Tech-bulletin.pdf &lt;ref&gt;http://files.sc.akzonobel.com/bulletins/Enhanced%20Oil%20Recovery-Tech-bulletin.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;).

==Theory==
The main advantages to using emulsified fuels instead of the fuel itself are environmental and economic benefits.   Addition of water to the diesel process decreases combustion temperatures and lowers NO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; emissions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://uf.catalog.fcla.edu/permalink.jsp?20UF030298757 Canfield, C A. ''Effects of Diesel-Water Emulsion Combustion on Diesel Engine Nox Emissions''. Florida: State University System of Florida, 1999. ]&lt;/ref&gt; An interesting paper (http://www.dieselnet.com/tech/engine_water.html#emu &lt;ref&gt;http://www.dieselnet.com/tech/engine_water.html#emu&lt;/ref&gt;) compares water injection and emulsified fuels into diesel engines (marine and stationary engines) and discusses the emissions and mechanisms involved. It concludes that emulsified fuels are singularly effective in simultaneously reducing NO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; and PM emissions. Another paper has examined the effects of EGR and Emulsion Fuels &lt;ref&gt;Bertola, A., Li, R., Boulouchos, K., “Influence of Water-in-Diesel Emulsions and EGR on Combustion and Exhaust Emissions of Heavy Duty DI-Diesel Engines equipped with Common-Rail Injector System”. SAE 2003-01-3146.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Endeavour House''' is the [[Suffolk County Council]] headquarters located in [[Ipswich]], [[Suffolk]], England. Endeavour House was originally owned by the American-based energy and electric company, [[TXU Corporation]]. Located on Russell Road Ipswich, [[England]]; Endeavour House was constructed between 2001 and 2003 by [[Bovis Lend Lease]] (now [[Lend Lease Project Management &amp; Construction]]) contractors as well as M&amp;S contractors and was designed by TTSP architects. The building had an original construction cost of £28 million ([[Suffolk County Council]] paid £16.75 million for the building) and is one of the most energy efficient office buildings in [[Europe]].&lt;ref name="Building.co.uk"/&gt;

==History==
[[File:Russell Road, Ipswich - geograph.org.uk - 1305042.jpg|thumb|Russell Road, Ipswich - geograph.org.uk - 1305042.jpg|thumb|Top|250px|Russell Road with Endeavour house pictured on the right.]]The American company TXU had originally wanted to build a corporate office in England however in November 2002, 4 months before the building was complete [[TXU Corporation]] went into administration. [[TXU Corporation]] quickly put the uncompleted building up for sale.&lt;ref name="Building.co.uk"/&gt; In 2003 [[Suffolk County Council]] were able to buy the 60% completed building for only £16 million.&lt;ref name=eadt2003&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eadt.co.uk/news/politics_2_480/work_progressing_on_new_county_hall_1_60583|publisher=EADT Suffolk Magazine|title=Work progressing on new county hall|date=July 4, 2003|accessdate=January 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; They made some alterations, the main change being the addition of a 90 desk chamber for 125 councilors on the second floor. The original plan for this was an indoor garden. Despite this the building has adapted well to its new role showing this to be an attractive building that is a good workplace.&lt;ref name=Building.co.uk /&gt; 
[[File:Arms of Suffolk.svg|thumb|right|101px|[[Suffolk County Council]] coat of arms]]
[[Suffolk County Council]] have energy bills of £422,000 a year, around 75% of this money goes straight back to the council.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ipswichstar.co.uk/news/full_cost_of_council_move_revealed_1_102614|publisher=Ipswich Star|title=Full cost of council move revealed|date=December 29, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; In late 2017 Babergh and Mid Suffolk District Councils will relocate to Endeavour House to lower costs on the councils. All 83 members of these 2 District Councils will be based in the headquarters for [[Suffolk County Council]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eadt.co.uk/news/babergh-and-mid-suffolk-councils-set-to-move-to-ipswich-in-september-1-5139064|publisher=EADT|title=Babergh and Mid Suffolk councils set to move to Ipswich in September|date=August 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Russell House===
Endeavour House was situated on the site of the now demolished Russell House. Russell House was once an Eastern Electricity Central Accounting Office but was demolished in 2001 to make way for the first stage of the [[Ipswich Village Development]], Endeavour House.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alltravels.com/united-kingdom/england/ipswich/videos/current-video-798288|publisher=alltravels|title=Demolition of Russell House}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Owners===
*[[TXU Corporation]] (original owners of the building but never moved in)
*[[Suffolk County Council]] 2003–present

===Current Tenants===
The main tenant is [[Suffolk County Council]] with every department including their NHS ([[National Health Service (England)]]) division being located in Endeavour House. The former planning and architecture division, [[Concertus Design and Property Consultants]] are also based in the building.

Suffolk [[Clinical commissioning group|CCGs]] will move into Endeavour house in October 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.eadt.co.uk/news/health-bosses-moving-to-ipswich-1-4807224|title=Health bosses moving to Ipswich|last=Geater|first=Paul|work=East Anglian Daily Times|access-date=2017-10-18|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ipswichandeastsuffolkccg.nhs.uk/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=qamf99NDytc%3d&amp;tabid=162&amp;portalid=1&amp;mid=4132|title=CCG Weekly Inbox|last=|first=|date=18 Oct 2017|website=NHS Ipswich &amp; East Suffolk CCG|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Location==
The site is in the heart of the [[Ipswich Village Development]] and is situated opposite [[Grafton House]] ([[Ipswich Borough Council]] HQ) located on 8 Russell Road. [[Portman Road]] Stadium is situated behind the building. There is limited surface car parking for permit holders with access from Constantine Road. There is also a large [[multi-storey car park]] shared with [[Ipswich Borough Council]] with access from Constantine Road.&lt;ref name="Access to Endeavour House"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.suffolk.gov.uk/assets/suffolk.gov.uk/Home%20Page/AccesstoEHFinal.pdf |publisher=Suffolk.gov |title=Access to Endeavour House |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141020063328/http://www.suffolk.gov.uk/assets/suffolk.gov.uk/Home%20Page/AccesstoEHFinal.pdf |archivedate=2014-10-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design==
[[File:Endeavour House, home of Suffolk County Council - geograph.org.uk - 1305055.jpg|Endeavour House, home of Suffolk County Council - geograph.org.uk - 1305055.jpg|thumb|250px|Endeavour House as seen from Constantine Road showing the rear of the building.]]

The five-storey building was designed as a corporate office building for TXU and consisted of some very energy efficient features. The building is an architectural achievement as it has 50,000 [[photovoltaic]] cells incorporated into the glass curtain walls, this being the largest installation of any office building in [[Europe]]. At peak sunlight these cells provide 57% of the buildings energy demand and also create a dark pattern of the glass. There is also rain collecting reservoirs underground which will recycle the water and pump it around the building to use in toilets.&lt;ref name=eadt2003 /&gt;

Features of Endeavour House:
*11,000 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; of floor space
*An occupation Density of 1:12 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;
*The largest installation of [[photovoltaic]] cells in any office building in [[Europe]]&lt;ref name="TTSP"/&gt;
*50,000 [[photovoltaic]] cells satisfy 57% of buildings energy demand
*Underground rain collecting reservoirs
*8 large meeting rooms all can hold 10+ people
*1 Council Chamber that holds 125 councilors
*Small meeting rooms spread around the building
*5 lifts
*14 accessible unisex toilets
*Restaurant and coffee shop 
*Wheelchair access
*Computer controlled lighting system 
&lt;ref name="Access to Endeavour House"/&gt;
The building has a design suited to a corporate business and is not a regular county council hall with its glass curtain walls, cantilever walkways and offices with windows that look into the concourse. This building is the complete opposite of their old headquarters at the [[East Suffolk County Hall]] which consisted of dark corridors circulating a hap hazard floor plan of a building that was built in 1837. So the building had to adapt to a workers who have been settled in a Victorian hall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eadt.co.uk/news/ipswich_fresh_hope_for_crumbling_county_hall_as_for_sale_signs_go_up_1_2244644|publisher=eadt|title=Ipswich: Fresh hope for crumbling County Hall as ‘for sale’ signs go up|date=June 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The building has adapted well and has received good comments. Endeavour House is proof that an office buildings can be externally stylish and adaptable to change.&lt;ref name="Building.co.uk"/&gt;

The building is split into two with a long concourse leading from the side to side with natural sunlight from a huge glass roof. The floor is pale white limestone with stairs hanging of the edge of each floor over the concourse. The main entrance hall is in the corner of the building where a large angled glass hall, of which allows tons of natural light to flood the building. In the other corner there is a smaller 2 storey cafe nestled into the open glass section, both corners are connected by the central concourse with a continuous glass roof allowing for a very large, modern and bright building.&lt;ref name="Building.co.uk"/&gt;

===Interior Design===
The interior is clean and very open planned, each department have a large, sleek open planned office which stretches the length of the building. Managing directors do not have their own office but share work space with the rest of the department, there is however many private meeting rooms per office. Each large open planned office has a small kitchen at the entrance to the office with a sitting area viewing over the concourse. Every office also has a set of toilets adjacent to the entrance.As the building is practically split into 2 separate buildings, there can be at least 2 departments per floor.&lt;ref name="Building.co.uk"/&gt; M&amp;S contractors were called in by [[Bovis Lend Lease]] to design and build the timber structural supports to hold the stairs that they also built. The cantilever stairs had to hang onto the concourse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mandscontractors.co.uk/local_authority.html|publisher=M&amp;S Contractor|title=Local authority}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
===Awards===
*Distinction/Ipswich society award
*Commendation/Civic Trust award&lt;ref name="TTSP"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4308">'''Fermentative hydrogen production''' is the [[Fermentation (biochemistry)|fermentative]] conversion of organic substrates to [[hydrogen|H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]].  Hydrogen produced in this manner is often called [[biohydrogen]].  The conversion is effected by [[bacteria]] and [[protozoa]], which employ [[enzyme]]s.  Fermentative hydrogen production is one of several [[Anaerobic digestion|anaerobic conversion]]s. 

==Dark vs photofermentation==
[[Dark fermentation]] reactions do not require light energy.  These are capable of constantly producing [[hydrogen]] from organic compounds throughout the day and night. Typically these reactions are coupled to the formation of carbon dioxide or formate.  Important reactions that result in hydrogen production start with [[glucose]], which is converted to [[acetic acid]]:&lt;ref&gt;Thauer, R. K., "Biochemistry of Methanogenesis: a Tribute to Marjory Stephenson", Microbiology 1998, 144, 2377-2406.  {{DOI|10.1099/00221287-144-9-2377}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;  +  2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O   →  2 CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H  +  2 CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  +  4 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
A related reaction gives [[formate]] instead of [[carbon dioxide]]:
:C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;  +  2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O   →  2 CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H  +  2 HCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H  +  2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
These reactions are exegonic by 216 and 209 kcal/mol, respectively.

Using [[synthetic biology]], bacteria can be genetically altered to enhance this reaction.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-163896478.html Synthetic biology and hydrogen]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.theguardian.com/science/2008/jun/19/chemistry.agriculture | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Chris | last=Edwards | title=Synthetic biology aims to solve energy conundrum | date=19 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Photofermentation]] differs from [[dark fermentation]], because it only proceeds in the presence of [[light]]. [[Electrohydrogenesis]] is used in [[microbial fuel cell]]s.

For example photo-fermentation with ''[[Rhodobacter sphaeroides]]'' SH2C can be employed to convert small molecular fatty acids into hydrogen.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&amp;cpsidt=18477081 High hydrogen yield from a two-step process of dark-and photo-fermentation of sucrose]&lt;/ref&gt;

''Enterobacter aerogenes'' is an outstanding hydrogen producer. It is an anaerobic facultative and mesophilic bacterium that is able to consume different sugars and in contrast to cultivation of strict anaerobes, no special operation is required to remove all oxygen from the fermenter. ''E. aerogenes'' has a short doubling time and high hydrogen productivity and evolution rate. Furthermore, hydrogen production by this bacterium is not inhibited at high hydrogen partial pressures; however, its yield is lower compared to strict anaerobes like ''Clostridia''. A theoretical maximum of 4&amp;nbsp;mol H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/mol glucose can be produced by strict anaerobic bacteria. Facultative anaerobic bacteria such as ''E. aerogenes'' have a theoretical maximum yield of 2&amp;nbsp;mol H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/mol glucose.&lt;ref name="Organosolv"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Asadi|first1=Nooshin|last2=Zilouei|first2=Hamid|title=Optimization of organosolv pretreatment of rice straw for enhanced biohydrogen production using Enterobacter aerogenes|journal=Bioresource Technology|date=March 2017|volume=227|pages=335–344|doi=10.1016/j.biortech.2016.12.073|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/311881656_Optimization_of_organosolv_pretreatment_of_rice_straw_for_enhanced_biohydrogen_production_using_Enterobacter_aerogenes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Flax''' (''Linum usitatissimum''), also known as '''common flax''' or '''linseed''', is a member of the genus ''[[Linum]]'' in the family [[Linaceae]]. It is a food and fiber crop cultivated in cooler regions of the world. The textiles made from flax are known in the Western countries as [[linen]], and traditionally used for bed sheets, underclothes, and table linen. The oil is known as [[linseed oil]].  In addition to referring to the plant itself, the word "flax" may refer to the unspun fibers of the flax plant. The plant species is known only as a cultivated plant,&lt;ref name=GRIN&gt;{{GRIN | accessdate = 2 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and appears to have been domesticated just once from the wild species ''[[Linum bienne]]'', called pale flax.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Allaby, R. |author2=Peterson, G. |author3=Merriwether, D. |author4=Fu, Y.-B. |year=2005 |title=Evidence of the domestication history of flax (''Linum usitatissimum'' L.) from genetic diversity of the sad2 locus |journal=Theoretical and Applied Genetics |volume=112 |issue=1 |pages=58–65 |doi=10.1007/s00122-005-0103-3|pmid=16215731 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several other species in the genus ''Linum'' are similar in appearance to ''L. usitatissimum'', cultivated flax, including some that have similar blue flowers, and others with white, yellow, or red flowers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.efloras.org/florataxon.aspx?flora_id=2&amp;taxon_id=118675 |title=Flora of China |chapter=''Linum'' |accessdate=2 October 2014 |author1=Quanru Liu |author2=Lihua Zhou |volume=11 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150405120646/http://efloras.org/florataxon.aspx?flora_id=2&amp;taxon_id=118675 |archivedate=5 April 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these are perennial plants, unlike ''L. usitatissimum'', which is an [[annual plant]].

Cultivated flax plants grow to {{convert|1.2|m|0|abbr=on}} tall, with slender stems. The [[leaf|leaves]] are [[glaucous]] green, slender [[lanceolate]], 20–40&amp;nbsp;mm long, and 3&amp;nbsp;mm broad.

The [[flower]]s are pure pale blue, 15–25&amp;nbsp;mm in diameter, with five petals. The [[fruit]] is a round, dry [[capsule (fruit)|capsule]] 5–9&amp;nbsp;mm in diameter, containing several glossy brown [[seed]]s shaped like an [[apple]] pip, 4–7&amp;nbsp;mm long.

==History==
The earliest evidence of humans using wild flax as a [[textile]] comes from the present-day [[Georgia (country)|Republic of Georgia]], where spun, dyed, and knotted wild flax fibers were found in [[Dzudzuana Cave]] and dated to the [[Upper Paleolithic]], 30,000 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=112726804&amp;sc=fb&amp;cc=fp |title=These Vintage Threads Are 30,000 Years Old |publisher=NPR |date= |accessdate=2010-11-13 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101204031535/http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=112726804&amp;sc=fb&amp;cc=fp |archivedate=2010-12-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Balter | first1 = M | year = 2009 | title = Clothes make the (Hu) Man | url = | journal = Science | volume = 325 | issue = 5946| page = 1329 | doi = 10.1126/science.325_1329a | pmid = 19745126 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kvavadze E, Bar-Yosef O, Belfer-Cohen A, Boaretto E, Jakeli N, Matskevich Z, Meshveliani T.

Since then, flax has lost its importance as a [[commercial crop]], due to the easy availability of more durable fibres.&lt;ref&gt;(2003) "The Oxford Encyclopedia of Economic History, Volume 1" Oxford University Press, p.303&lt;/ref&gt;

Flax is grown for its seeds, which can be ground into a meal or turned into [[Flaxseed oil|linseed oil]], a product used as a [[nutritional supplement]] and as an ingredient in many [[wood finishing|wood-finishing]] products. Flax is also grown as an [[ornamental plant]] in gardens. Moreover, flax fibers are used to make [[linen]]. The Latin name of the species, ''usitatissimum,'' means "most useful".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = McHughen | first1 = A | year = 1990 | title = Flax (Linum usitatissimum L.): In Vitro Studies | url = | journal = Biotechnology in Agriculture and Forestry | volume = 10 | issue = | pages = 502–514 | doi=10.1007/978-3-642-74448-8_24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Flax fibers taken from the stem of the plant are two to three times as strong as cotton fibers. Additionally, flax fibers are naturally smooth and straight. Europe and North America both depended on flax for plant-based cloth until the 19th century, when cotton overtook flax as the most common plant for making [[Rag paper|rag-based paper]]. Flax is grown on the Canadian [[Prairie|prairies]] for linseed oil, which is used as a drying oil in paints and varnishes and in products such as [[linoleum]] and [[Printing ink|printing inks]].

Linseed meal, the byproduct of producing linseed oil from flax seeds, is used to feed [[livestock]]. It is a protein-rich [[Animal feed|feed]] for ruminants, rabbits, and fish.&lt;ref&gt;Heuzé V., Tran G., Nozière P., Lessire M., Lebas F., 2017. Linseed meal.

Flaxseeds occur in two basic varieties/colors: brown and yellow (golden linseeds).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2007/mar/06/healthandwellbeing.health1 | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Amanda | last=Grant | title=Superfoods | date=2007-03-06 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160921210717/https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2007/mar/06/healthandwellbeing.health1 | archivedate=2016-09-21 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most types of these basic varieties have similar [[nutritional]] characteristics and equal numbers of short-chain [[omega-3 fatty acid]]s. The exception is a type of yellow flax called solin ([[trade name]] "[[Linola]]"), which has a completely different oil profile and is very low in omega-3s.

Flaxseeds produce a [[vegetable oil]] known as flaxseed oil or [[linseed oil]], which is one of the oldest commercial oils. It is an [[edible oil]] obtained by [[expeller pressing]] and sometimes followed by [[solvent extraction]]. Solvent-processed flaxseed oil has been used for many centuries as a [[drying oil]] in painting and varnishing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.webexhibits.org/pigments/intro/renaissance.html|title=Pigments through the Ages - Renaissance and Baroque (1400-1600)|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120719190829/http://www.webexhibits.org/pigments/intro/renaissance.html|archivedate=2012-07-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although brown flaxseed varieties may be consumed as readily as the yellow ones, and have been for thousands of years, its better-known uses are in paints, for fiber, and for cattle feed.

It is mainly used in [[Savji]] [[curries]], such as [[mutton]] ([[goat meat]]) curries.

Whole flaxseeds are chemically stable, but ground flaxseed meal, because of oxidation, may go [[rancidity|rancid]] when left exposed to air at room temperature in as little as one week.&lt;ref name=DieteticAss&gt;{{cite journal|last=Alpers|first=Linda |author2=Sawyer-Morse, Mary K. |title=Eating Quality of Banana Nut Muffins and Oatmeal Cookies Made With Ground Flaxseed|journal=Journal of the American Dietetic Association|volume=96|issue=8|pages=794–796|date=August 1996|doi=10.1016/S0002-8223(96)00219-2|pmid=8683012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Refrigeration and storage in sealed containers will keep ground flaxseed meal for a longer period before it turns rancid.

===Flax fibers===
[[File:Heckling Shop Irvine.JPG|left|thumb|A [[Heckling (flax)|heckling]] shop used to prepare flax fibers]]

Flax fiber is extracted from the [[Bast (biology)|bast]] beneath the surface of the stem of the flax plant. Flax fiber is soft, lustrous, and flexible; bundles of fiber have the appearance of blonde hair, hence the description "flaxen" hair. It is stronger than cotton fiber, but less elastic. The best grades are used for linen fabrics such as [[damask]]s, [[lace]], and [[Bed sheet|sheeting]]. Coarser grades are used for the manufacturing of [[twine]] and [[rope]], and historically, for [[canvas]] and [[webbing equipment]]. Flax fiber is a raw material used in the high-quality paper industry for the use of printed [[banknote]]s, [[rolling paper|laboratory paper(blotting and filter), rolling paper]] for [[cigarette]]s, and [[tea bag]]s.[[File:Flax field.JPG|thumb|A flax field in bloom in [[North Dakota]]]]

The use of flax fibers dates back tens of thousands of years; [[linen]], a refined textile made from flax fibers, was worn widely by [[Sumer]]ian priests more than 4,000 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;The Sumerians: Their history, culture and character, [[Samuel Noah Kramer]], pg.104, {{cite web |url=http://oi.uchicago.edu/sites/oi.uchicago.edu/files/uploads/shared/docs/sumerians.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-06-12 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160327203605/http://oi.uchicago.edu/sites/oi.uchicago.edu/files/uploads/shared/docs/sumerians.pdf |archivedate=2016-03-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Industrial-scale flax fiber processing existed in antiquity. A [[Bronze Age]] factory dedicated to flax processing was discovered in [[Euonymeia]].&lt;ref name="Kaza2015"&gt;{{cite book |last=Kaza-Papageorgiou |first1=Konstantina |url=https://www.amazon.com/Ancient-Astiki-beneath-Vouliagmenis-Avenue/dp/9606878945 |title=The Ancient Astiki Odos and the Metro beneath Vouliagmenis Avenue |location=Athens, Greece |publisher=Kapon Editions |date=2015-11-30 |isbn=978-9606878947 |accessdate=2016-05-03 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180211041528/https://www.amazon.com/Ancient-Astiki-beneath-Vouliagmenis-Avenue/dp/9606878945 |archivedate=2018-02-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Flax mill]]s for spinning flaxen [[yarn]] were invented by [[John Kendrew (inventor)|John Kendrew]] and [[Thomas Porthouse]] of [[Darlington]], [[England]], in 1787.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first = A. J. | last = Wardey | title = The Linen Trade: Ancient and Modern | year = 1967 | page = 752 | publisher = Routledge | isbn = 0-7146-1114-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; New methods of processing flax &lt;!-- out of date and the rising price of cotton --&gt; have led to renewed interest in the use of flax as an industrial fiber.

==Cultivation==
{{unreferenced section|date=February 2016}}
The [[soil]]s most suitable for flax, besides the [[alluvial]] kind, are deep [[loam]]s containing a large proportion of [[organic matter]]. Flax is often found growing just above the waterline in [[cranberry]] bogs. Heavy [[clay]]s are unsuitable, as are soils of a [[gravel]]ly or dry [[sand]]y nature. Farming flax requires few [[fertilizer]]s or [[pesticide]]s. Within eight weeks of sowing, the plant can reach {{convert|10|–|15|cm|abbr=on}} in height and grows several centimeters per day under its optimal growth conditions, reaching {{convert|70|–|80|cm|abbr=on}} within 50 days.

==Harvesting==
===Maturation===
Flax is harvested for fiber production after about 100 days, or a month after the plants flower and two weeks after the seed capsules form. The bases of the plants begin to turn yellow. If the plants are still green, the seed will not be useful, and the fiber will be underdeveloped. The fiber degrades once the plants turn brown.

Flax grown for seed is allowed to mature until the seed capsules are yellow and just starting to split; it is then harvested in various ways. A [[combine harvester]] may either cut only the heads of the plants, or the whole plant. These are then dried to extract the seed. The amount of weeds in the straw affects its marketability, and this, coupled with market prices, determines whether the farmer chooses to harvest the flax straw. If the flax straw is not harvested, typically, it is burned, since the stalks are quite tough and decompose slowly (''i.e.'', not in a single season). Formed into [[windrow]]s from the harvesting process, the straw often clogs up tillage and planting equipment. Flax straw that is not of sufficient quality for fiber uses can be baled to build shelters for farm animals, or sold as biofuel, or removed from the field in the spring.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.producer.com/2008/03/the-last-straw-nine-ways-to-handle-flax-straw/ |title=The last straw: nine ways to handle flax straw |author=Michael Raine |date=27 March 2008 |journal=The Western Producer |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518092042/http://www.producer.com/2008/03/the-last-straw-nine-ways-to-handle-flax-straw/ |archivedate=18 May 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two ways are used to harvest flax fiber, one involving mechanized equipment (combines), and a second method, more manual and targeting maximum fiber length.

===Harvesting for fiber===

====Mechanical====
Flax for fiber production is usually harvested by a specialized flax harvester. Usually built on the same machine base as a combine, but instead of the cutting head it has a flax puller. The flax plant turned over and is gripped by rubber belts roughly 20–25&amp;nbsp;cm (8-10") above ground, to avoid getting grasses and weeds in the flax. The rubber belts then pulls the whole plant out of the ground with the roots so the whole length of the plant fiber can be used. The plants then pass over the machine and is placed on the field crosswise to the harvesters direction of travel. The plants are left in the field for field retting.

The mature plant can also be cut with mowing equipment, similar to hay harvesting, and raked into windrows. When dried sufficiently, a combine then harvests the seeds similar to wheat or oat harvesting .

====Manual====
The plant is pulled up with the roots (not cut), so as to increase the fiber length. After this, the flax is allowed to dry, the seeds are removed, and it is then [[Retting|retted]]. Dependent upon climatic conditions, characteristics of the sown flax and fields, the flax remains on the ground between two weeks and two months for retting. As a result of alternating rain and the sun, an enzymatic action degrades the pectins which bind fibers to the straw. The farmers turn over the straw during retting to evenly rett the stalks. When the straw is retted and sufficiently dry, it is rolled up. It is then stored by farmers before extracting the fibers.

==Processing==
[[File:Drhlen.jpg|thumb|A hackle or heckle, a tool for threshing flax and preparing the fiber]]
[[File:58-aspetti di vita quotidiana,abbigliamento lino,Taccuino Sa.jpg|thumb|Flax tissues, [[Tacuinum sanitatis]], 14th century]]
[[Threshing]] is the process of removing the seeds from the rest of the plant. Separating the usable flax fibers from other components requires pulling the stems through a hackle and/or beating the plants to break them.

Flax processing is divided into two parts: the first part is generally done by the farmer, to bring the flax fiber into a fit state for general or common purposes. This can be performed by three machines: one for threshing out the seed, one for breaking and separating the straw (stem) from the fiber, and one for further separating the broken straw and matter from the fiber.

The second part of the process brings the flax into a state for the very finest purposes, such as [[lace]], [[cambric]], [[damask]], and very fine [[linen]]. This second part is performed by a refining machine.

&lt;!-- how-to, not encyclopedic * Take the flax in small handsful in the left hand, spread it flat between the third and little finger, with the seed end downward, and the root-end above, as near the hand as possible.
* Put the handful between the beaters of the breaking machine, and beat it gently till the three or four inches, which have been under the operation of the machine, appear to be soft.
* Remove the flax a little higher in the hand, so as to let the soft part of the flax rest upon the little finger, and continue to beat it till all is soft, and the wood is separated from the fiber, keeping the left hand close to the block and the flax as flat upon the block as possible.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}
* The other end of the flax is then to be turned, and the end which has been beaten is to be wrapped round the little finger, the root end flat, and beaten in the machine till the wood is separated, exactly in the same way as the other end was beaten. --&gt;

==Preparation for spinning==

[[File:Rhof-flachsbearbeitung.ogv|thumb|Threshing, retting, and dressing flax at the [[Roscheider Hof Open Air Museum]] (German)]]
Before the flax fibers can be spun into linen, they must be separated from the rest of the stalk. The first step in this process is [[retting]], which is the process of rotting away the inner stalk, leaving the outer parts intact. At this point, straw, or coarse outer stem ([[cortex (botany)|cortex]] and [[epidermis (botany)|epidermis]]), is still remaining. To remove this, the flax is "broken", the straw is broken up into small, short bits, while the actual fiber is left unharmed. [[Scutching]] scrapes the outer straw from the fiber. The stems are then pulled through "hackles", which act like combs to remove the straw and some shorter fibers out of the long fiber.

===Retting flax===
Several methods are used for [[retting]] flax. It can be retted in a pond, stream, field, or tank. When the retting is complete, the bundles of flax feel soft and slimy, and quite a few fibers are standing out from the stalks. When wrapped around a finger, the inner woody part springs away from the fibers.  Pond retting is the fastest. It consists of placing the flax in a pool of water which will not evaporate. It generally takes place in a shallow pool which will warm up dramatically in the sun; the process may take from a few days to a few weeks. Pond-retted flax is traditionally considered of lower quality, possibly because the product can become dirty, and is easily over-retted, damaging the fiber. This form of retting also produces quite an odor. Stream retting is similar to pool retting, but the flax is submerged in bundles in a stream or river. This generally takes two or three weeks longer than pond retting, but the end product is less likely to be dirty, does not smell as bad, and because the water is cooler, is less likely to be over-retted. Both pond and stream retting were traditionally used less because they pollute the waters used for the process.

In field retting, the flax is laid out in a large field, and dew is allowed to collect on it. This process normally takes a month or more, but is generally considered to provide the highest quality flax fibers,{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} and it produces the least pollution.

Retting can also be done in a plastic trash can or any type of water-tight container of wood, concrete, earthenware, or plastic. Metal containers will not work, as an acid is produced when retting, and it would [[corrode]] the metal. If the water temperature is kept at {{convert|80|F|C}}, the retting process under these conditions takes 4 or 5 days. If the water is any colder, it takes longer. Scum  collects at the top, and an odor is given off the same as in pond retting. 'Enzymatic' retting of flax has been researched as a technique to engineer fibers with specific properties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Akin Dodd | first1 = Foulk | year = 2008 | title = Pectinolytic enzymes and retting | url = | journal = BioResources | volume = 3 | issue = 1| pages = 155–169 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Akin Dodd | first1 = Foulk | year = 2001 | title = Processing techniques for improving enzyme-retting of flax | url = | journal = Industrial Crops and Products | volume = 13 | issue = | pages = 239–248 | doi=10.1016/s0926-6690(00)00081-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dressing the flax===

&lt;/gallery&gt;
Dressing the flax is the process of removing the straw from the fibers. Dressing consists of three steps: breaking, scutching, and heckling. The breaking breaks up the straw. Some of the straw is scraped from the fibers in the scutching process, and finally, the fiber is pulled through heckles to remove the last bits of straw.

:Breaking breaks up the straw into short segments. &lt;!-- more how-to To do it, take the bundles of flax and untie them. Next, in small handsful, put it between the beater of the breaking machine (a set of wooden blades that mesh together when the upper jaw is lowered, which look like a paper cutter but instead of having a big knife it has a blunt arm), and beat it till the three or four inches that have been beaten appear to be soft. Move the flax a little higher and continue to beat it till all is soft, and the wood is separated from the fiber. When half of the flax is broken, hold the beaten end and beat the rest in the same way as the other end was beaten, till the wood is separated. --&gt;

:[[Scutching]] removes some of the [[straw]] from the fiber&lt;!-- , it helps to swing a wooden scutching knife down the fibers while they hang vertically, thus scraping the edge of the knife along the fibers and pull away pieces of the stalk. Some of the fiber will also be scutched away, this cannot be helped and is a normal part of the process --&gt;.

:[[Heckling (flax)|Heckling]] is pulling the fiber through various sizes of [[heckling comb]]s or heckles. A heckle is a bed of "nails"—sharp, long-tapered, tempered, polished steel pins driven into wooden blocks at regular spacing. &lt;!-- A good progression is from four pins per square inch, to 12, to 25 to 48 to 80. The first three will remove the straw, and the last two will split and polish the fibers. Some of the finer stuff that comes off in the last hackles is called [[tow]] and can be [[carding|carded]] like wool and [[spinning (textiles)|spun]]. It will produce a coarser yarn than the fibers pulled through the heckles because it will still have some straw in it. --&gt;

==Genetically modified flax contamination==
[[File:Flax Plants.jpg|thumb|Small flax plants]]

==Symbolic images==
Flax is the emblem of [[Northern Ireland]] and displayed by the [[Northern Ireland Assembly]]. In a coronet, it appeared on the reverse of the [[One pound (British coin)|British one-pound coin]] to represent Northern Ireland on coins minted in 1986, 1991, and 2014. Flax also represents Northern Ireland on the badge of the [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom]] and on various logos associated with it.

Common flax is the national flower of [[Belarus]].

In early versions of the [[Sleeping Beauty]] tale, such as "[[Sun, Moon, and Talia]]" by [[Giambattista Basile]], the princess pricks her finger, not on a spindle, but on a sliver of flax, which later is sucked out by her children conceived as she sleeps.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18061">'''Fuel saving devices''' are sold on the [[Aftermarket (automotive)|aftermarket]] with claims to improve the [[Fuel economy in automobiles|fuel economy]] and/or the [[Automobile emissions control|exhaust emissions]] of any purport to optimize ignition, air flow, or fuel flow in some way. An early example of such a device sold with difficult-to-justify claims is the 200 mpg [[carburetor]] designed by Canadian inventor [[Charles Nelson Pogue]].

The US [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|EPA]] is required by Section 511 of the [[Motor Vehicle Information and Cost Savings Act]] to test many of these devices and to provide public reports on their efficacy; the agency finds most devices do not improve fuel economy to any measurable degree, unlike [[forced induction]], [[water injection (engine)]], [[intercooling]] and other fuel economy devices which have been long proven.&lt;ref name=EPA&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/otaq/consumer/reports.htm EPA Gas Saving and Emission Reduction Devices Evaluation]&lt;/ref&gt; Tests by [[Popular Mechanics]] magazine also found unproven types of devices yield no measurable improvements in fuel consumption or power, and in some cases actually decrease both power and fuel economy.&lt;ref name="magnetshdtw"&gt;{{citation|title=Looking For A Miracle: We Test Automotive 'Fuel Savers'|work=Popular Mechanics|author=Mike Allen|url=http://www.popularmechanics.com/cars/alternative-fuel/gas-mileage/1802932}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other organizations generally considered reputable, such as the [[American Automobile Association]] and [[Consumer Reports]] have performed studies with the same result.&lt;ref name=Autogram&gt;{{cite journal | title = Things that Don't Work: A Look at Gas-Saving Gadgets | journal = AAA AUTOgram | date = May–June 1999 | issue = 30| id = | url = http://www.fileden.com/files/2009/9/30/2589169//AAA_Gas_Savers.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 2011-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Gas-saving devices tested |journal=Consumer Reports |date=July 2010 |issue=30 |id= |url=http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/cars/tires-auto-parts/car-maintenance/gassaving-devices-904/overview/index.htm |accessdate=2011-05-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5ys7Wz7NP?url=http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/cars/tires-auto-parts/car-maintenance/gassaving-devices-904/overview/index.htm |archivedate=May 22, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One reason that ineffective fuel saving gadgets are popular is the difficulty of accurately measuring small changes in the fuel economy of a vehicle. This is because of the high level of variance in the fuel consumption of a vehicle under normal driving conditions. Due to [[selective perception]] and [[confirmation bias]], the buyer of a device can perceive an improvement where none actually exists.  Also, [[observer-expectancy effect]] can result in a user subconsciously altering driving habits. These biases can be either positive or negative to the device tested, depending on the biases of the individual. For these reasons, regulatory bodies have developed standardized [[driving cycle|drive cycles]] for consistent, accurate testing of vehicle fuel consumption.&lt;ref name="ps74"&gt;{{citation|work=Popular Science|date=August 1974|title=Those "gas-saving" gadgets... do they or don't they?|author=Jim Dunne|pages=67–68|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uRAgliO29ZwC&amp;pg=PA67}}&lt;/ref&gt; Where fuel economy does improve after the fitment of a device, it is usually due to the tune-up procedure that is conducted as part of the installation.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|work=Popular Science|date=March 1980|title=At last- EPA tests reveal the truth about those gas-saving devices|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4ODjVe3M21QC&amp;pg=PA117|pages=117–119, 182}}&lt;/ref&gt; In older systems with [[Ignition system#Mechanically timed ignition|distributor ignitions]], device manufacturers would specify [[Ignition timing|timing advance]] beyond that recommended by the manufacturer, which by itself could boost fuel economy while potentially increasing emissions of some combustion products, at the risk of possible [[Engine knocking|engine damage]].&lt;ref name="ps74"/&gt;

==Types of devices==

===Accessory drive modifications===
Modifying the [[Automobile accessory power|accessory drive]] system can increase fuel economy and performance to some extent.&lt;ref&gt;[[Better Business Bureau]] [https://web.archive.org/web/20070807160236/http://bbbsilicon.org/topic178.html list of ineffective retrofit devices and glossary of terms]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Underdrive pulleys]] modify the amount of engine power that can be drawn by accessory devices. Such alterations to the drive systems for [[alternator]]s or [[air conditioning]] compressors (rather than the power steering pump, for example) can be detrimental to vehicle usability (e.g., by not keeping the battery fully charged), but will not impair safety.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://autospeed.com/cms/title_Dozen-Tech-Tips/A_1669/article.html |title=Dozen Tech Tips |publisher=AutoSpeed |date= |accessdate=2013-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fuel &amp; oil additives===
[[Chemical compound|Compounds]] sold for addition to the vehicle's fuel may include [[tin]], [[magnesium]] and [[platinum]]. The claimed purpose of these is generally to
improve the [[energy density]] of the fuel.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} Additives for addition to the [[engine oil]], sometimes marketed as "engine treatments", contain [[teflon]], [[zinc]], or [[chlorine]] compounds.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ftc.gov/opa/2001/02/zmax1.shtm FTC lawsuit: ZMax oil additive] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111002054407/http://www.ftc.gov/opa/2001/02/zmax1.shtm |date=October 2, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ftc.gov/opa/2000/03/motor.shtm FTC lawsuit: DuraLube oil additives] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130115032631/http://www.ftc.gov/opa/2000/03/motor.shtm |date=January 15, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ftc.gov/opa/1995/12/stp.shtm FTC lawsuit: STP engine treatment] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606130427/http://www.ftc.gov/opa/1995/12/stp.shtm |date=June 6, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ftc.gov/opa/1996/07/slick.shtm FTC lawsuit: Slick-50 engine treatment] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110316200235/http://www.ftc.gov/opa/1996/07/slick.shtm |date=March 16, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ftc.gov/opa/1999/09/prolong.shtm FTC lawsuit: ProLong engine treatment] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111002054356/http://www.ftc.gov/opa/1999/09/prolong.shtm |date=October 2, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ftc.gov/opa/1999/04/motorup5.shtm FTC lawsuit: MotorUP oil additive] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110404083454/http://www.ftc.gov/opa/1999/04/motorup5.shtm |date=April 4, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Magnets===
[[Magnets]] attached to a vehicle's fuel line have been claimed to improve fuel economy by aligning fuel molecules, but because motor fuels are [[Chemical polarity|non-polar]], no such alignment or other magnetic effect on the fuel is possible. When tested, typical magnet devices had no effect on vehicle performance or economy.&lt;ref name="magnetshdtw"/&gt;

===Vapor devices===
Some devices claim to improve efficiency by changing the way that liquid fuel is converted to [[vapor]]. These include fuel heaters and devices to increase or decrease [[turbulence]] in the intake [[Inlet manifold|manifold]]. These do not work on standard vehicles because the principle is already applied to the design of the engine.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fuelsaving.info/turbulence.htm&lt;/ref&gt; This method is however integral to making vegetable oil conversions, and similar heavy oil engines, run at all. &lt;ref&gt;http://journeytoforever.org/biodiesel_svo.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Air bleed devices===
Devices have been marketed which bleed a small amount of air into the fuel line before the carburetor.  These may improve fuel economy because the engine runs slightly lean as a consequence.  However, running leaner than the manufacturer intended can cause overheating, piston damage, loss of maximum power and poor emissions (e.g., higher NOx due to higher combustion temperatures, or, if misfiring occurs, higher HC).

===Electronic devices===
Some electronic devices are marketed as fuel savers. The Fuel Doctor FD-47, for example, plugs into the vehicle's cigarette lighter and displays several [[Light emitting diode|LEDs]]. It is claimed to increase vehicle fuel economy by up to 25% through "power conditioning of the vehicle's electrical systems",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2010/03/30/idUS178263+30-Mar-2010+BW20100330 |work=Reuters |title=Fuel Doctor USA's FD-47 Available Now at Best Buy |date=2010-03-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130627042046/http://www.reuters.com/article/2010/03/30/idUS178263+30-Mar-2010+BW20100330 |archivedate=2013-06-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; but ''Consumer Reports'' detected no difference in economy or power in tests on ten separate vehicles, finding that the device did nothing but light up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.consumerreports.org/cars/2010/12/fuel-doctor-fd-47-fails-the-consumer-reports-fuel-economy-mpg-test.html |title=Fuel Doctor FD-47 fails the Consumer Reports mpg test |publisher=News.consumerreports.org |date=2010-12-07 |accessdate=2013-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Car and Driver]]'' magazine found that the device contains nothing but "a simple circuit board for the LED lights",&lt;ref name="cnd"&gt;{{cite web|author=MICHAEL AUSTIN |url=http://www.caranddriver.com/features/11q2/fuel-saving_devices_debunked_dynamic_ionizer_fuel_doctor_fd-47_and_three_more_tested-gearbox |title=Fuel-Saving Devices Debunked: Dynamic Ionizer, Fuel Doctor FD-47, Hot InaZma Eco, Moletech Fuel Saver, Fuel Boss Magnetic Fuel Saver - Gearbox |publisher=Car and Driver |date=May 2011 |accessdate=2013-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; and disassembly and circuit analysis reached the same conclusion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.compendiumarcana.com/fuel_doctor_fd47/ How the Fuel Doctor Works]&lt;/ref&gt; The maker disputed claims that the device has no effect,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press |title=Fuel Doctor Challenges Consumer Reports |date=10 December 2010 |publisher=Fuel Doctor USA |url=http://www.fueldoctorusa.com/fuel-doctor-challenges-consumer-reports/ |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110611154844/http://www.fueldoctorusa.com/fuel-doctor-challenges-consumer-reports/ |archivedate=2011-06-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and proposed changes to the ''Consumer Reports'' testing procedure, which when implemented made no difference to the results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=New Fuel Doctor tests: Still no MPG magic|work=Consumer Reports|date=26 May 2011|url=http://news.consumerreports.org/cars/2011/05/new-fuel-doctor-tests-still-no-mpg-magic.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another device described as 'electronic' is the 'Electronic Engine Ionizer Fuel Saver'. Testing of this device resulted in a loss of power and an engine compartment fire.&lt;ref name="magnetshdtw"/&gt;

There are also genuinely useful 'emissions-control [[defeat device]]s' that operate by allowing a vehicle's engine to operate outside government-imposed tailpipe emissions parameters. These government standards force factory engines to operate outside their most efficient range of operation. Either engine control units are reprogrammed to operate more efficiently,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/compliance/resources/newsletters/civil/enfalert/defeat.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-10-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110830052554/http://www.epa.gov/compliance/resources/newsletters/civil/enfalert/defeat.pdf |archivedate=2011-08-30 |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt; or sensors that influence the ECU's operation are modified or 'simulated' to cause it to operate in a more efficient manner. Oxygen sensor simulators allow fuel-economy reducing [[catalytic converter]]s to be removed.&lt;ref name="settlement"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/federal-settlement-targets-illegal-emission-control-defeat-devices-sold-for-autos-52720722.html |title=Federal Settlement Targets Illegal Emission Control 'Defeat Devices' Sold for Autos |publisher=Prnewswire.com |date=July 10, 2007 |accessdate=2013-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such devices are often sold for "off-road use only".&lt;ref name="settlement"/&gt;

==Thermodynamic efficiency==
The reason why most devices are not capable of producing the claimed improvements is based in [[thermodynamics]]. This formula expresses the theoretical efficiency of a petrol engine:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://courses.washington.edu/me341/oct22v2.htm |title=Improving IC Engine Efficiency|publisher=University of Washington |accessdate=June 4, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \eta = 1 - {1 \over r_v ^{\gamma-1}} &lt;/math&gt;

where '''''η''''' is efficiency, '''''r&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;''''' is the [[compression ratio]], and '''''γ''''' is the [[Heat capacity ratio|ratio of the specific heats]] of the cylinder gases.

Assuming an ideal engine with no friction, perfect insulation, perfect combustion, a compression ratio of 10:1, and a 'γ' of 1.27 (for gasoline-air combustion), the theoretical efficiency of the engine would be 46%.

For example, if an automobile typically gets 20 miles&lt;32.19&amp;nbsp;km&gt; per gallon with a 20% efficient engine that has a 10:1 compression ratio, a carburetor claiming 100MPG would have to increase the efficiency by a factor of 5, to 100%. This is clearly beyond what is theoretically or practically possible. A similar claim of 300MPG for any vehicle would require an engine (in this particular case) that is 300% efficient, which violates the [[First Law of Thermodynamics]].

Extremely efficient vehicle designs capable of achieving 100MPG+ (such as the [[Volkswagen 1-litre car|VW 1l]]) do not have substantially greater engine efficiency, but instead focus on better [[aerodynamics]], reduced vehicle weight, and [[regenerative braking|using energy that would otherwise be dissipated as heat during braking]].

==Urban legend==
There is a debunked&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.snopes.com/autos/business/carburetor.asp Snopes.com: Nobody's Fuel]&lt;/ref&gt; [[urban legend]] about an inventor who creates a 100 mpg (2.35&amp;nbsp;L/100&amp;nbsp;km) or even 200 mpg [[carburetor]], but after demonstrating it for the major vehicle manufacturers, the inventor mysteriously disappears. In some versions of the story, he is claimed to have been killed by the government. This fiction is thought to have started after Canadian [[Charles Nelson Pogue]] filed in 1930 for such a device,&lt;ref&gt;{{US patent|1750354}}&lt;/ref&gt; followed by others.&lt;ref&gt;{{US patent|1938497}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{US patent|1997497}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===MythBusters===
The popular U.S. television show ''[[MythBusters]]'' investigated several fuel-saving devices using gasoline- and diesel-powered [[Fuel injection|fuel-injected]] cars under controlled circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kwc.org/mythbusters/2006/05/exploding_trousers_great_gas_conspiracy.html|title=Episode 53: Exploding Trousers, Great Gas Conspiracy|work=Unofficial MythBusters: Episode guides|publisher=|author=|date=2006-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fuel line magnets, which supposedly align the fuel molecules so they burn better, were tested and found to make no difference in fuel consumption. The debunked&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.snopes.com/autos/techno/acetone.asp Snopes.com: Acetone Deaf]&lt;/ref&gt; notion that adding [[acetone]] to gasoline improves efficiency by making the gasoline burn more completely without damaging the plastic parts of the fuel system was tested, and although there was no apparent damage the fuel system, the vehicle's fuel economy was actually worsened.

The show tested the hypothesis that a car with a carburetor type gasoline engine can run on [[hydrogen]] gas alone, which was confirmed as viable, although the high cost of hydrogen gas as well as storage difficulties currently prohibit widespread adoption. They also tested a device that supposedly produces sufficient hydrogen to power a car by [[electrolysis]] (running an electric current through water to split its molecules into hydrogen and oxygen). Although some hydrogen was produced, the amount was minuscule compared to the quantity necessary to run a car for even a few seconds.

The show also tested a [[carburetor]] that, according to its manufacturer, could improve [[fuel efficiency]] to 300 miles&lt;482.80&amp;nbsp;km&gt; per gallon. However, the device actually made the car less fuel efficient. They also determined that a [[Diesel engine|diesel]]-powered car can run on used [[Straight vegetable oil|cooking oil]] though they did not check whether it damaged the engine.

The show noted that out of 104 fuel efficiency devices tested by the EPA, only seven showed any improvement in efficiency, and even then, the improvement was never more than six percent. The show also noted that if any of the devices they tested actually worked to the extent they were supposed to, the episode would have been one of the most legendary hours of television.

'''Gharo Wind Power Plant''' is an underconstruction wind power generation project being built in the persistently wind-swept corridor of [[Gharo]], [[Sindh]], [[Pakistan]]. This will be one of the first [[wind power]] projects in Pakistan.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=2006\story_14-5-2006_pg5_10 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080414060608/http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=2006 |date=April 14, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ae-accessenergy.com/news/05-14-2006.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; [[Halcrow Group|Halcrow Pakistan]] and the Spanish company, based in Barcelona, Taller d'Enginyeria Ambiental SL have compiled the Enivoronmental Impact Assessment for this project.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.undp.org.pk/images/publications/Environmental%20and%20Socio-Economic%20Baseline%20Report%20of%20Gharo%20Wind%20Carridor.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC) approved $288 million for financing two wind power projects in Sindh in order to overcome power shortage and promote clean energy in [[Pakistan]]. OPIC would help [[Pakistan]] diversify its energy production to include important contributions from renewable energy sources.
The OPIC credit facility would help build 50 MW Sapphire wind power plant in [[Gharo-Ketti Bandar wind corridor]], designed to generate 133 giga watt hours of emission-free electricity annually. &lt;ref name="thenews.com.pk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenews.com.pk/Todays-News-4-167078-Two-wind-power-projects-approved|title=The News International: Latest News Breaking, Pakistan News|website=www.thenews.com.pk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, 45 wind power projects of around 3200 MW capacity are under process in [[Pakistan]]. &lt;ref name="thenews.com.pk"/&gt;

[[Image:La bordes.jpg|thumb|Harold &amp; Wife Kwailan La Borde]]
'''Harold La Borde''' was a Trinidadian sailor and [[adventurer]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.trinidadexpress.com/featured-news/_The_journey_that_is_life_-112221909.html|title='The journey that is life'|date=December 20, 2010|work=Trinidad Express|accessdate=2 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; who from 1969 to 1973 [[circumnavigated]] the world in his 40-ft [[ketch]] ''Hummingbird II''. He was accompanied by his wife, Kwailan, and his five-year-old son Pierre.  As the first known Trinidadian sailors to cross the [[Atlantic]] and later to circumnavigate, Harold and Kwailan were awarded the nation's highest honour&amp;nbsp;– the  Gold [[Trinity Cross]].

Harold was born in [[Trinidad]], West Indies, on June 18th 1933 (died June 2016), of parents with a rich mixture of blood in their veins&amp;nbsp;– French, African, Spanish and [[Amerindian]] (Carib). He was educated at a local Roman Catholic school and began his sailing career by building [[dinghies]], in which he taught himself the rudiments of [[seamanship]], and reading any book about deep-sea sailing that he could lay his hands on. Harold La Borde was determined to get a suitable boat, opting to build one himself.

In his first book, ''An Ocean to Ourselves'' (1962), La Borde tells how he built a 26-foot ketch ''Humming Bird''. Harold and Kwailan, who were married in 1959, made their maiden voyage in the 26-foot vessel, ''Humming Bird'', to England in 1960, together with a friend, Buck Wong Chong.  The ''Humming Bird'' was subsequently sold, and says Harold "is somewhere in Europe."

The La Bordes, always working as a team, took jobs at an [[Outward Bound]] school in [[Nigeria]] in 1961, after the voyage, but the call of the sea was too strong for the young couple and they returned to Trinidad in 1963, when they started to build the 40-foot ketch ''Humming Bird II''. Their first-born son, Pierre, arrived while work was in progress.

The boat was completed in three years and, after chartering her out to [[United States|Americans]] for a further three years in order to raise sufficient funds, the family set out on 2 February 1969&lt;ref&gt;http://www.newsday.co.tt/commentary/0,178205.html&lt;/ref&gt; on the, now historic, voyage that took them around the world. Harold and Kwailan were both awarded their nation's highest award, the Trinity Cross for their seafaring adventure. Their second son, Andre, was born in [[Auckland]], [[New Zealand]], during the voyage.

Upon their return home, the 40-foot ''Humming Bird II'' was purchased by the [[Trinidad and Tobago]] Government in 1973, and can be seen in the museum near the lighthouse on South Quay; and according to Harold "is rotting away there. It is a sad thing, especially when you talk about taking care of historical things."

The La Bordes went on to another [[circumnavigation]] voyage via [[Cape Horn]] (1984–86) in the ''Humming Bird III''.

Harold La Borde T.C. also wrote a further two books with input from his family, wife Kwailan and sons Pierre and André, ''All Oceans Blue'' (1977), and ''Lonely Oceans South'' (1987).

Documentary films of their travels were made in conjunction with the Government Film Unit, which were also very professionally put together. After retiring from their respective jobs in Trinidad, the La Bordes ran a small family marina in Trinidad's busiest yachting bay. Harold's full-time job was working on the Humming Bird III, every day while Kwailan finished their autobiography which includes all of their sailing voyages to the present, entitled ''Wind, Sea, and Faith''.

Harold La Borde died on June 12, 2016, leaving behind his wife, sons Pierre and Andre, three grandchildren (Shannon, Arama, and Sanchia), and his brothers Rudy and Hugh.

'''Sir Joseph Wilson Swan''' [[Fellow of the Royal Society|FRS]] (31 October 1828&amp;nbsp;– 27 May 1914) was an English physicist, chemist, and inventor. He is known as an independent early developer of a successful [[incandescent light bulb]], and is the person responsible for developing and supplying the first incandescent lights used to illuminate homes and public buildings, including the [[Savoy Theatre]], London, in 1881.&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth E. Hendrickson III, The Encyclopedia of the Industrial Revolution in World History, Volume 3, Rowman &amp; Littlefield&amp;nbsp;— 2014, page 564{{ISBN missing|date=December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CassellsChronology&gt;{{cite book|last=Williams|first=Hywel|title=Cassell's Chronology of World History|location=[[London]]|publisher=[[Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson]]|year=2005|isbn=0-304-35730-8|pages=434–435}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1904, Swan was [[Knight Bachelor|knighted]] by [[Edward VII|King Edward VII]], awarded the Royal Society's [[Hughes Medal]], and was made an honorary member of the [[Royal Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain|Pharmaceutical Society]]. He had received the highest decoration in France, the [[Legion of Honour]], when he visited the [[International Exposition of Electricity|1881 International Exposition of Electricity, Paris]].

==Early life==
Joseph Wilson Swan was born in 1828 at Pallion Hall in [[Pallion]], in the Parish of [[Bishopwearmouth]], [[City of Sunderland|Sunderland]], [[County Durham]]. His parents were John Swan and Isabella Cameron.&lt;ref name=fsu&gt;Davidson, Michael W. and The Florida State University. "Molecular expressions.

Retrieved 16 November 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Swan was apprenticed for six years to a [[Sunderland]] firm of [[Pharmacist|druggists]], ''Hudson and Osbaldiston''.&lt;ref name=RPSGB.org.uk /&gt; However, it is not known if Swan completed his six-year apprenticeship, as both partners subsequently died.&lt;ref name=RPSGB.org.uk /&gt; He was said to have had an enquiring mind,&lt;ref name=RPSGB.org.uk /&gt; even as a child. He augmented his education with a fascination of his surroundings, the industry of the area, and reading at Sunderland Library.&lt;ref name=RPSGB.org.uk /&gt; He attended lectures at the Sunderland Atheneum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kstc.co.uk/josephswan/home.html|title=Joseph Swan: Biography|first=Jon|last=Plumley|website=www.kstc.co.uk|access-date=10 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Swan subsequently joined Mawson's, a firm of manufacturing chemists in [[Newcastle upon Tyne]], started in the year of Swan's birth by John Mawson&lt;ref name=RPSGB.org.uk /&gt; (9 September 1819&amp;nbsp;– 17 December 1867), the husband of his sister, Elizabeth Swan (22 November 1822&amp;nbsp;– 2 August 1905). In 1846, Swan was offered a partnership at Mawson's.&lt;ref name=RPSGB.org.uk /&gt; This company subsequently existed as ''Mawson, Swan and Morgan'' until 1973, formerly located on Grey Street in Newcastle upon Tyne, near [[Grey's Monument]]. The premises, now occupied by burger chain restaurant [[Byron Hamburgers|Byron]], can be identified by a line of [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]]-style electric [[Street light|street lamps]] in front of the store on Grey Street.

Swan lived at [[Underhill, Low Fell, Gateshead]], a large house on Kells Lane North, where he conducted most of his experiments in the large [[Conservatory (greenhouse)|conservatory]].&lt;ref&gt;Newton, Douglas (1978) [https://books.google.com/books?id=zNgPIKR8FK4C&amp;pg=PA290 New Scientist, 26 October 1978] Retrieved 30 December 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The house was later converted into a private fee paying, grant aided co-educational grammar school named Beaconsfield School.&lt;ref name=BEAC&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=mHAnAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=Beaconsfield+School+joseph+swan&amp;dq=Beaconsfield+School+joseph+swan&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=y-wcTZrlBIKAhAfdme22Dg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAQ Electrical times, Volume 145] p. 220.

==Electric light==
[[File:carbonfilament.jpg|thumb|190px|Carbon filament lamp (E27 socket, 220 [[volt]]s, approx. 30 watts, left side: running with 100 volts)]]
In 1850, Swan began working on a light bulb using [[carbon]]ised paper filaments in an evacuated glass bulb. By 1860, he was able to demonstrate a working device, and obtained a British patent covering a partial [[vacuum]], carbon filament incandescent lamp.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} However, the lack of a good vacuum and an adequate electric source resulted in an inefficient light bulb with a short lifetime.

In 1875, Swan returned to consider the problem of the light bulb with the aid of a better vacuum and a carbonised thread as a filament. The most significant feature of Swan's improved lamp was that there was little residual [[oxygen]] in the [[vacuum]] tube to ignite the filament, thus allowing the filament to glow almost white-hot without catching fire. However, his filament had low resistance, thus needing heavy copper wires to supply it.&lt;ref name="si.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://americanhistory.si.edu/lighting/bios/swan.htm|title=Lighting A Revolution: Joseph W. Swan|website=americanhistory.si.edu|access-date=10 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Swan first publicly demonstrated his incandescent carbon lamp at a lecture for the Newcastle upon Tyne Chemical Society on 18 December 1878. However, after burning with a bright light for some minutes in his laboratory, the lamp broke down due to excessive current. On 17 January 1879, this lecture was successfully repeated with the lamp shown in actual operation; Swan had solved the problem of incandescent electric lighting by means of a vacuum lamp. On 3 February 1879, he publicly demonstrated a working lamp to an audience of over seven hundred people in the lecture theatre of the [[Literary and Philosophical Society of Newcastle upon Tyne]], [[William Armstrong, 1st Baron Armstrong|Sir William Armstrong]] of [[Cragside]] presiding. Swan turned his attention to producing a better carbon filament, and the means of attaching its ends. He devised a method of treating cotton to produce "parchmentised thread", and obtained British Patent 4933 on 27 November 1880.&lt;ref&gt;Swan K. R. ''Sir Joseph Swan and the Invention of the incandescent electric lamp''. London: Longmans, Green and Co., 1946 pp. 21–25{{ISBN missing|date=December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; From that time he began installing light bulbs in homes and landmarks in England.

Retrieved 8 August 2011&lt;/ref&gt; In 1881, he founded his own company, The Swan Electric Light Company,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ideafinder.com/history/inventions/lightbulb.htm Ideafinder.com, ''Light Bulb History'', accessed 17 July 2012]&lt;/ref&gt; and started commercial production.&lt;ref&gt;Chirnside, R.C.

The [[Savoy Theatre|Savoy]], a state-of-the-art theatre in the [[City of Westminster]], London, was the first public building in the world lit entirely by electricity.&lt;ref name=CassellsChronology /&gt;&lt;ref name=Burgess&gt;Burgess, Michael. "Richard D'Oyly Carte", ''The Savoyard'', January 1975, pp. 7–11{{ISBN missing|date=December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Swan supplied about 1,200 incandescent lamps, powered by an {{convert|88.3|kW|hp|lk=on|adj=on|abbr=off}} generator on open land near the theatre.&lt;ref name=Times&gt;"The Savoy Theatre", ''[[The Times]]'', 3 October 1881&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gooday, Graeme.

Pickering &amp; Chatto, 2008, p.107, accessed 30 November 2010{{ISBN missing|date=December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The builder of the Savoy, [[Richard D'Oyly Carte]], explained why he had introduced Swan's electric light: "The greatest drawbacks to the enjoyment of the theatrical performances are, undoubtedly, the foul air and heat which pervade all theatres. As everyone knows, each [[gas lighting|gas-burner]] consumes as much oxygen as many people, and causes great heat beside. The incandescent lamps consume no oxygen, and cause no perceptible heat."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lyricoperasandiego.org/resource_library/PeopleCarte.htm "Richard D'Oyly Carte"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090413125856/http://www.lyricoperasandiego.org/resource_library/PeopleCarte.htm|date=13 April 2009}}, at the Lyric Opera San Diego website, June 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The first generator proved too small to power the whole building, and though the entire front-of-house was electrically lit, the stage was lit by gas until 28 December 1881. At that performance, Carte stepped onstage and broke a glowing lightbulb before the audience to demonstrate the safety of Swan's new technology. On 29 December 1881, ''[[The Times]]'' described the electric lighting as superior, visually, to gaslight.&lt;ref&gt;[http://math.boisestate.edu/GaS/carte/savoy/electric.html Description of lightbulb experiment] in ''The Times'', 29 December 1881&lt;/ref&gt;

The first private residence, other than the inventor's, lit by the new incandescent lamp was that of his friend, [[William Armstrong, 1st Baron Armstrong|Sir William Armstrong]] at [[Cragside]], near [[Rothbury]], Northumberland. Swan personally supervised the installation there in December 1880. Swan had formed "The Swan Electric Light Company Ltd" with a factory at Benwell, Newcastle, and had established the first commercial manufacture of incandescent lightbulbs by the beginning of 1881.

Swan's carbon rod lamp and carbon filament lamp, while functional, were still relatively impractical due to low resistance (needing very expensive thick copper wiring) and short running life.&lt;ref name="si.edu" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/2009/12/1218joseph-swan-electric-bulb/|title=Dec. 18, 1878: Let There Be Light&amp;nbsp;— Electric Light|publisher=|access-date=10 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; While searching for a better filament for his light bulb, Swan inadvertently made another advance. In 1881, he developed and patented a process for squeezing [[nitrocellulose]] through holes to form conducting fibres. His newly established company (which by merger eventually became the Edison and Swan United Company) used Swan's [[cellulose]] filaments in their bulbs. The textile industry has also used this process.&lt;ref name=fsu /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timmonet.co.uk/html/body_joseph_swan.htm|title=Joseph Wilson Swan|publisher=Timmonetk|access-date=21 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The first ship to use Swan's invention was ''The City of Richmond'', owned by the Inman Line. She was fitted with incandescent lamps in June 1881. The [[Royal Navy]] also introduced them to their ships soon after; with [[HMS Inflexible (1876)|HMS ''Inflexible'']] having the new lamps installed in the same year.&lt;ref name="kenneth_swan" /&gt; An early employment in engineering was during the digging of the [[Severn Tunnel]], where contractor [[Thomas A. Walker|Thomas Walker]] installed "20-candlepower lamps" in the temporary pilot tunnels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Walker|first1=Thomas A|title=The Severn Tunnel Its Construction and Difficulties|date=1888|publisher=Richard Bentley and Son|location=London|page=73}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Swan was one of the early developers of the electric [[safety lamp]] for miners, exhibiting his first in Newcastle upon Tyne at the [[North of England Institute of Mining and Mechanical Engineers]] on 14 May 1881.&lt;ref&gt;Swan.

It took development by others over the next 20 years or so before effective electric lamps were in common use.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, A. V. and Tarkenter, R. P.

==Conjunction with Edison==

In what are considered to be independent lines of inquiry, Swan's incandescent electric lamp was developed at the same time [[Thomas Edison]] was working on his incandescent lamp&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Maury Klein, The Power Makers: Steam, Electricity, and the Men Who Invented Modern America, Bloomsbury Publishing USA&amp;nbsp;— 2010, Chapter 9&amp;nbsp;— The Cowbird, The Plugger, and the Dreamer&lt;/ref&gt; with Swan's first successful lamp and Edison's lamp both patented in 1879.&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth E. Hendrickson III, The Encyclopedia of the Industrial Revolution in World History, Volume 3, Rowman &amp; Littlefield&amp;nbsp;— 2014, page 564&lt;/ref&gt; Edison's goal in developing his lamp was for it to be used as one part of a much larger system: a long-life high-resistance lamp that could be connected in [[Series and parallel circuits#Parallel circuits|parallel]] to work economically with the large-scale electric-lighting utility he was creating.&lt;ref&gt;David O. Whitten, Bessie Emrick Whitten, Handbook of American Business History: Manufacturing, Greenwood Publishing Group, 1990, pages 315-316&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto" /&gt; Swan's original lamp design, with its low resistance (the lamp could only be used in [[Series and parallel circuits#Series circuits|series]]) and short life span, was not suited for such an application.&lt;ref name="auto" /&gt;

===Ediswan===
Swan's strong patents in Great Britain led, in 1883, to the two competing companies merging to exploit both Swan's and Edison's inventions,&lt;ref name="kenneth_swan" /&gt; with the establishment of the [[Edison and Swan Electric Light Company|Edison &amp; Swan United Electric Light Company]]. Known commonly as "Ediswan", the company sold lamps made with a cellulose filament that Swan had invented in 1881, while the Edison Company continued using [[bamboo]] filaments outside of Britain. In 1892, [[General Electric]] (GE) began exploiting Swan's patents to produce cellulose filaments, until they were replaced in 1904 by a GE developed "General Electric Metallized" (GEM) baked cellulose filaments.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.edisontechcenter.org/incandescent.html Incandescent Lamps, History of the Incandescent Light (1802&amp;nbsp;— today)], EdisonTechCenter.org {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/6E0ipiqZM?url=http://www.edisontechcenter.org/incandescent.html|date=28 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1886, Ediswan moved production to a former [[jute]] mill at [[Ponders End]], North London.&lt;ref&gt;Pam, D. (1977),''The New Enfield: Stories of Enfield Edmonton and Southgate, a Jubilee History'', London Borough of Enfield Libraries, Arts &amp; Entertainment Dept&lt;/ref&gt; In 1916, Ediswan set up the UK's first radio [[Vacuum tube|thermionic valve]] factory at Ponders End. This area, with nearby [[Brimsdown Industrial Estate|Brimsdown]] subsequently developed as a centre for the manufacture of thermionic valves, [[cathode ray tube]]s, etc., and nearby parts of [[London Borough of Enfield|Enfield]] became an important centre of the [[electronics]] industry for much of the 20th century. Ediswan became part of [[British Thomson-Houston]] and [[Associated Electrical Industries]] (AEI) in the late 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis J.(2001), ''London's Lea Valley: more secrets revealed'', Phillimore, {{ISBN|1-86077-190-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When working with wet photographic plates, Swan noticed that heat increased the sensitivity of the silver bromide emulsion. By 1871, he had devised a method of using dry plates, and substituting [[nitrocellulose]] plastic for glass plates, thus initiating the age of convenience in photography. Eight years later, he patented [[Photographic paper#Bromide papers|bromide paper]], developments of which are still used for black-and-white photographic prints.

In 1864, Swan patented the transfer process for making [[carbon print]]s, a permanent photographic process. By adding the transfer step, Swan was able to easily make photographs with a full tonal range.

==Later life==
In 1894, Swan was elected a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]] (FRS),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.royalsociety.org/DServe/dserve.exe?dsqIni=Dserve.ini&amp;dsqApp=Archive&amp;dsqCmd=Show.tcl&amp;dsqDb=Persons&amp;dsqPos=0&amp;dsqSearch=%28Surname%3D%27swan%27%29|title=Library and Archive Catalogue|publisher=Royal Society|access-date=23 October 2010}}{{dead link|date=December 2017|bot=InternetArchiveBot|fix-attempted=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in September 1901, he was awarded the honorary degree of [[Doctor of Science]] (D.Sc.) from [[Durham University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper The Times|articlename=University intelligence|day_of_week=Monday|date=30 September 1901|page_number=4|issue=36573}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1904, he was [[knight]]ed, awarded the Royal Society's [[Hughes Medal]], and made an honorary member of the Pharmaceutical Society. Swan died in 1914 at [[Warlingham]] in Surrey.

In 1945, the London Power Company commemorated Swan by naming a new 1,554 [[Gross register tonnage|GRT]] [[Coastal trading vessel|coastal]] [[Collier (ship)|collier]] SS ''Sir Joseph Swan''.&lt;ref name="kenneth_swan"&gt;Sir Josepth Swan and the Invention of the Incandescent Electric Lamp by Kenneth R.

'''Knot density''' is a traditional [[quality (business)|measure for quality]] of handmade or [[knotted-pile carpet|knotted pile]] [[carpet]]s. It refers to the number of [[knot]]s, or '''knot count''', per unit of [[surface area]] - typically either per [[square inch]] ('''kpsi''') or per [[square centimeter]] ('''kpsc'''), but also per [[decimeter]] or [[meter]] ('''kpsd''' or '''kpsm'''). Number of knots per unit area is directly proportional to the quality of carpet.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.mrgreencarpetcare.com/rug/silk-rug-cleaning Silk Rug Cleaning - Modern and Oriental Rug Cleaning]", ''MrGreenCarpetCare.com''. "The quality of an Oriental rug – and all silk rugs in general, is determined by a most important factor: the rug's knot density." Accessed: December 13, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Woodhead"&gt;Goswami, K.K.; ed. (2009). ''Advances in Carpet Manufacture'', p.239. Woodhead Publishing in Textiles: Number 87 ([[The Textile Institute]]). {{ISBN|9781845695859}}. "Knot density is an indicator of quality; the greater the number of knots per square inch (kpsi), the better the quality of the carpet."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cucker"&gt;Cucker, Felipe (2013). ''Manifold Mirrors: The Crossing Paths of the Arts and Mathematics'', p.89-90. Cambridge University. {{ISBN|9781107354494}}. "The knot density...not only provides a measure of the work required to produce a given rug but also sets limits to the possible designs."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Daniel, Elton L. and ʻAlī Akbar Mahdī (2006). ''Culture and Customs of Iran'', p.138. Greenwood. {{ISBN|9780313320538}}. "Another basic factor in determining the quality of a carpet is knot density...—more knots indicate finer work, better quality, and a higher price.&lt;/ref&gt; Density may vary from 25 to over 1000 kpsi, or 4 to over 155 kpsc, where ≤80 kpsi is poor quality, 120 to 330 kpsi medium to good, and ≥330 kpsi is very good quality.&lt;ref name="Woodhead"/&gt; The [[multiplicative inverse|inverse]], '''knot ratio''', is also used to compare characteristics.&lt;ref name="Stone"&gt;Stone, Peter F. (2014). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=pxTQAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT597&amp;dq=%22knot+density%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiQvejY5_HQAhVX-GMKHViUBVoQ6AEILTAD#v=onepage&amp;q=%22knot%20density%22&amp;f=false Oriental Rugs: An Illustrated Lexicon of Motifs, Materials, and Origins]'', unpaginated. Tuttle. {{ISBN|9781462911844}}. ''Knot density'': "In a knotted pile fabric, the knots per unit area.

''Knot ratio'': "In a knotted pile carpet, the vertical or warp-wise knot count per linear unit measure divided by the horizontal or weft-wise knot count per linear unit measure."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;(1990). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=Q0oIAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22knot+density%22&amp;dq=%22knot+density%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjO647frPLQAhVE8WMKHXm8CaE4FBDoAQg6MAY Textile Museum Journal]'', Volumes 27-37, p.68. "Knot density itself is less significant than the ratio of horizontal to vertical knot counts."&lt;/ref&gt; Knot density = warp×weft while knot ratio = warp/weft. For comparison: 100,000/square meter = 1,000/square decimeter = 65/square inch = 179/''gereh''.

For two carpets of the same age, origin, condition and design, the one with the higher number of knots will be the more valuable. Knot density is normally measured in knots per [[square inch]] (KPSI) which is simply the number of vertical knots across one inch of carpet multiplied by the number of horizontal knots in the same area. Average knot density varies between region and design. A rug could have a knot density half that of another yet still be more valuable, KPSI is only one measurement of quality and value in [[Persian carpet]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Murphy, Brian (2006). ''The Root of Wild Madder: Chasing the History, Mystery, and Lore of the Persian Carpet'', p.47. Simon and Schuster. {{ISBN|9780743264211}}. "Knot counts appear in almost every carpet book, catalogue, and auction guide. It's a convenient yardstick to compare the intricacy of the work...But it's a seriously flawed method to assess quality or beauty."&lt;/ref&gt;

Knot density is related to and affects or affected by the thickness of the length of the [[pile (textile)|pile]] and the width of the [[warp and woof]],&lt;ref name="Tzareva"&gt;Tzareva, Elena (1984). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=NDTrAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22knot+density%22&amp;dq=%22knot+density%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjO647frPLQAhVE8WMKHXm8CaE4FBDoAQhCMAg Rugs &amp; carpets from Central Asia: the Russian collections]'', p.12-3. Penguin. {{ISBN|9780140063691}}. "The greater the knot density, the thinner the weft and warp yarns and the more weakly are they twisted; the smaller the density, the coarser are the foundation yarns." "In small pieces where a high pile was not required, the knot density was often far greater. As less time was needed to weave smaller items, their makers demonstrated greater care, choosing a more complex design that necessitated a greater knot density."&lt;/ref&gt; and also the designs and motifs used and their characteristics and appearance.&lt;ref name="Tzareva"/&gt; "In rugs with a high knot density, curvilinear, elaborate motifs are possible. In those with a low knot density (as well as kilims), simpler, rectilinear, motifs tend to prevail."&lt;ref name="Cucker"/&gt; "A carpet design with a high knot density is better adapted to intricate and curvilinear designs, which of necessity must have a shorter pile length to avoid looking blurry. A carpet with a lesser knot density is better adapted to bold, geometric designs and can utilize a long pile for softer, more reflective surface that appeals to the sense of touch."&lt;ref name="Denny"&gt;Denny, Walter B. (2014). ''How to Read Islamic Carpets'', p.43 &amp; 61. Metropolitan Museum of Art. {{ISBN|9780300208092}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hand-tying of knots is a very labour-intensive task. An average [[weaving|weaver]] can tie almost 10,000 knots per day. More difficult patterns with an above-average knot density can only be woven by a skillful weaver, thus increasing the production costs even more. An average weaver may tie 360 knots per hour (1/10 seconds), while 1200 knots approaches the maximum a skilful weaver can tie per hour.&lt;ref name="Woodhead"/&gt;

In the late fifteenth century a "carpet design revolution" occurred, made possible by finer yarns, and before this time it is rare to find carpets with ≥120 kpsi but by the next century carpets with three to four times that density were fairly common.&lt;ref name="Denny"/&gt; For example, the [[Pazyryk carpet]] (ca. 400 BCE) is around 234 kpsi and the [[Ardabil Carpet]]s (ca. 1550 CE) are 300–350 kpsi. A fragment of a silk [[Mughal carpet]] in the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] has a knot density of 2,516 kpsi and a silk [[Hereke]] [[prayer rug]] (ca. 1970 CE) contains 4,360 symmetric kpsi.&lt;ref name="Stone"/&gt; However, the rug with the highest knot density is a silk Hereke masterpiece by the Özipeks workshops, having an incredible density of approximately 10,000 kpsi, with a production time of about 15 years. (FN5a - https://new.liveauctioneers.com/item/53198792_probably-the-finest-rug-in-the-world-silk-hereke)

In Persian, ''reg'' (''raj'', ''rag'', Persian: "row, course") refers to the knots per '''''gereh''''' (Persian: "knot"), which refers to a unit of approximately 2.75 inches.&lt;ref name="Stone"/&gt; ''Dihari'' is a unit of 6,000 knots used to measure production in India.&lt;ref name="Stone"/&gt;

==Overview==
The power station is a [[run-of-river]] installation with generation capacity of {{convert|7.6|MW}} and annual production of 36.7 GWh.&lt;ref name="About"/&gt; The original design had the main intake via a "headrace tunnel". In the new design, that has been replaced by a "headrace canal". This has reduced project costs and construction time.&lt;ref name="About"/&gt; The budgeted cost of construction is US$24 million.&lt;ref name="About"/&gt;

==Construction timeline==
Construction began in early 2017 and commissioning is expected in the fourth quarter of 2018.&lt;ref name="About"/&gt;

[[File:Liquid Air, Power &amp; Automobile Co 1900.jpg|thumb|Share of the Liquid Air, Power &amp; Automobile Co., issued 30. August 1900]]
'''Liquid Air''' was the brand name of an unusual [[automobile]] planned by Liquid Air Power and Automobile Co. of London in 1899.&lt;ref name = VSCM/&gt;

The first factory location was acquired in [[Boston|Boston, Massachusetts]] in 1899, and its owners claimed that they could construct a car that would run a hundred miles on [[liquid air]].{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} By 1901 the company had gone into receivership. In 1902 the product was demonstrated by its designer, Hans Knudsen, at a show in [[London]]; apparently the automobile that was shown was a modified [[Locomobile Company of America|Locomobile]] steamer. Here it was claimed to run {{Convert|40|mi|km}} at {{Convert|12|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} on {{Convert|18|usgal|L impgal|0|abbr=on}} of liquid air, sold at a [[shilling]] a [[gallon]].{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}

'''Lottery competition''' in [[ecology]] is a model for how organisms [[Competition (biology)|compete]].  It was first used to describe competition in coral reef fish.&lt;ref name="ChessonWarner1981"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chesson|first1=Peter L.|last2=Warner|first2=Robert R.|title=Environmental Variability Promotes Coexistence in Lottery Competitive Systems|journal=The American Naturalist|date=June 1981|volume=117|issue=6|pages=923–943|doi=10.1086/283778}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Under lottery competition, many offspring compete for a large number of sites (e.g., many [[Juvenile fish|fry]] competing for a few territories, or many seedlings competing for a few [[treefall gap]]s).  Under lottery competition, one individual is chosen randomly to "win" that site (typically becoming an adult soon after), and the "losers" typically die off.  Thus, in an analogy to a lottery or [[raffle]], every individual has an equal chance of winning (like every ticket has an equal chance of being chosen), and therefore more abundant species are proportionately more likely to win (just as an individual who buys more tickets is more likely to win).  Some models&lt;ref name="ChessonWarner1981" /&gt;&lt;ref name="chesson1994"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chesson|first1=P.|title=Multispecies Competition in Variable Environments|journal=Theoretical Population Biology|date=1 June 1994|volume=45|issue=3|pages=227–276|doi=10.1006/tpbi.1994.1013|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0040580984710136}}&lt;/ref&gt; generalize this idea by weighting some individuals who are more likely to be chosen (by analogy, this would be like some tickets counting as two tickets instead of one).

Lottery competition has been used to in understanding many key ideas in ecology, including the [[storage effect]] (species coexist because they are affected differently by environmental variation)&lt;ref name="ChessonWarner1981" /&gt;&lt;ref name="chesson1994" /&gt; and [[Unified neutral theory of biodiversity|neutral theory]] (species diversity is maintained because species are competitively equivalent, and extinction rates are slow enough to be offset by speciation and dispersal events).&lt;ref name="hubbell2001"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hubbell|first1=Stephen P.|title=The unified neutral theory of biodiversity and biogeography|date=2001|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, N.J.|isbn=0-691-02129-5|edition=Print on Demand.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Albany Lumber Yard 1870s.png|thumb|Frank A. Jagger loads his boat full of lumber at the [[Albany Lumber District]] in [[Albany, New York]] in the 1870s]]

A '''lumber yard''' is a location where [[lumber]] and [[wood]]-related products used in [[construction]] and/or [[home improvement]] projects are processed or stored. Some lumber yards offer [[retail]] sales to consumers, and some of these may also provide services such as the use of [[Thickness planer|planer]]s, saws and other large machines.

Generally, '''timber yards''' are locations where raw [[Trunk (botany)|logs]] and other wood or [[forest product]]s are processed and stored.&lt;ref&gt;Döring, Stephan (2012). [https://books.google.com/books?id=NU-NhpbJxFsC&amp;pg=PA72 ''Power from Pellets: Technology and Applications'']. Springer. pp. 72-74. {{ISBN|3642199623}}&lt;/ref&gt; The terms "lumber yard" and "timber yard" are sometimes used interchangeably, and timber yards may include additional aspects that lumber yards encompass, and vice versa.

==Overview==
Lumber yards sell products made at [[lumber mill]]s,&lt;ref name="PT"/&gt; where customers pick up products at the yard themselves or request that an order be built and delivered to them by the lumber yard. Lumber yards may also sell wood-plastic composites, such as [[Trex (Composite Material)|Trex]], any other type of construction material or supplies, and general [[hardware store]] [[household hardware|items]]. Lumber yards are the primary resources for contractors and homeowners when construction material is needed. [[Home Depot]] stores also have lumber sections, but this may not be considered a ''lumber yard'', although it serves the same purpose. Lumber yards use [[forklift|forklift trucks]] to move the large heavy units of lumber around the yard. [[Saw]]s may also be available to cut boards to a desired length for customers.

At timber yards (also sometimes referred to as lumber yards), logs and other forest products are processed and stored. Additional activities include inspection for signs of rot, utilizing stacking techniques to prevent rot from forming, and the removal of bark and spraying of pesticides to prevent insect infestation.&lt;ref&gt;Jahnel, Franz (2000).

Bold Strummer. p. 67. {{ISBN|0933224990}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some lumber/timber yards use [[Crane (machine)|crane]]s to move logs, and sprinklers to keep the logs moist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.enterprise-journal.com/news/article_94442a0c-58ff-11e2-bae0-0019bb2963f4.html?mode=image&amp;photo=0 | title=Lumber yard a busy place | publisher=''[[Enterprise Journal]]'' (McComb, Mississippi) | accessdate=14 October 2013 | author=Hall, Phillip}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===

====Products====
Some lumber yards sell products that are assessed and certified by the [[Forest Stewardship Council]]'s (FSC), per its standards. One lumber yard in [[Portland, Oregon]] limits its product line to only those that meet or exceed FSC's requirements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://portlandtribune.com/sl/158972-one-of-a-kind-lumber-yard-only-stocks-wood-that-meets-fsc-rules- | title=One-of-a-kind lumber yard only stocks wood that meets FSC rules | publisher=''[[Portland Tribune]]'' | date=August 15, 2013 | accessdate=14 October 2013 | author=Law, Steve}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, Sustainable Northwest, a nonprofit environmental group in Portland, Oregon, began operations sourcing and purveying environmentally friendly "green wood" products.&lt;ref name="PT"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702304703104575174541891049132 | title='Green Wood' Lumberyard Out on a Limb | publisher=''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' | date=April 12, 2010 | accessdate=14 October 2013 | author=Carlton, Jim}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group specializes in offering wood products that are sourced from trees in non-threatened forests.&lt;ref name="PT"/&gt;

[[File:Magnetopause.jpg|thumb|350px| Artistic rendition of the Earth's magnetopause. The magnetopause is where the pressure from the solar wind and the planet's magnetic field are equal. The position of the Sun would be far to the left in this image.]]

The '''magnetopause''' is the abrupt boundary between a [[magnetosphere]] and the surrounding [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]].  For [[planetary science]], the magnetopause is the boundary between the planet’s magnetic field and the [[solar wind]]. The location of the magnetopause is determined by the balance between the pressure of the dynamic planetary magnetic field and the dynamic pressure of the solar wind. As the solar wind pressure increases and decreases, the magnetopause moves inward and outward in response. Waves (ripples and flapping motion) along the magnetopause move in the direction of the solar wind flow in response to small-scale variations in the solar wind pressure and to [[Kelvin–Helmholtz instability]].

The solar wind is supersonic and passes through a [[bow shock]] where the direction of flow is changed so that most of the solar wind plasma is deflected to either side of the magnetopause, much like water is deflected before the bow of a ship. The zone of shocked solar wind plasma is the [[magnetosheath]]. At Earth and all the other planets with intrinsic magnetic fields, some solar wind plasma succeeds in entering and becoming trapped within the magnetosphere.  At Earth, the solar wind plasma which enters the magnetosphere forms the [[plasma sheet]]. The amount of solar wind plasma and energy that enters the magnetosphere is regulated by the orientation of the [[interplanetary magnetic field]], which is embedded in the solar wind.

The Sun and other stars with magnetic fields and stellar winds have a solar magnetopause or [[Heliopause (astronomy)|heliopause]] where the stellar environment is bounded by the interstellar environment.

==Characteristics==
[[File:dipole-and-image-dipole.png|thumb|300px|Schematic representation of a planetary dipole magnetic field in a vacuum (right side) deformed by a region of plasma with infinite conductivity. The Sun is to the left. The configuration is equivalent to an image dipole (green arrow) being placed at twice the distance from the planetary dipole to the interaction boundary.&lt;ref name="CB1940"&gt;{{cite book|title=Geomagnetism, Vol. II|date=1940|publisher=[[Oxford Univ. Press]]|author=Sydney Chapman|author2=J. Bartels}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Prior to the age of space exploration, interplanetary space was considered to be a vacuum.  The coincidence of the [[Carrington super flare]] and the [[Solar storm of 1859|super geomagnetic event of 1859]] was evidence that plasma was ejected from the Sun during a flare event.  Chapman and Ferraro &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chapman|first=Sidney|author2=V. C. A. Ferraro|title=A new theory of magnetic storms|journal=Terrestrial Magnetism|date=1931|volume=36|pages=77–97}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chapman|first=Sidney|author2=V. C. A.

Ferraro|title=A new theory of magnetic storms, II. The main phase|journal=Terrestrial Magnetism|date=1933|volume=38|pages=79}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chapman|first=Sidney|author2=V. C. A. Ferraro|title= The theory of the first phase of the geomagnetic storm |journal=Terrestrial Magnetism|date=1940|volume=45|issue=3|pages=245|doi=10.1029/te045i003p00245|bibcode=1940TeMAE..45..245C}}&lt;/ref&gt; proposed that a plasma was emitted by the Sun in a burst as part of a flare event which disturbed the planet's magnetic field in a manner known as a geomagnetic storm.  The collision frequency of particles in the plasma in the interplanetary medium is very low and the electrical conductivity is so high that it could be approximated to an infinite conductor.  A magnetic field in a vacuum cannot penetrate a volume with infinite conductivity.  Chapman and Bartels (1940)&lt;ref name="CB1940" /&gt; illustrated this concept by postulating a plate with infinite conductivity placed on the dayside of a planet’s dipole as shown in the schematic.  The field lines on the dayside are bent.  At low latitudes, the magnetic field lines are pushed inward.  At high latitudes, the magnetic field lines are pushed backwards and over the polar regions.  The boundary between the region dominated by the planet’s magnetic field (i.e., the [[magnetosphere]]) and the plasma in the interplanetary medium is the magnetopause.  The configuration equivalent to a flat, infinitely conductive plate is achieved by placing an image dipole (green arrow at left of schematic) at twice the distance from the planet’s dipole to the magnetopause along the planet-Sun line.  Since the solar wind is continuously flowing outward, the magnetopause above, below and to the sides of the planet are swept backward into the geomagnetic tail as shown in the artist’s concept.  The region (shown in pink in the schematic) which separates field lines from the planet which are pushed inward from those which are pushed backward over the poles is an area of weak magnetic field or day-side cusp.  Solar wind particles can enter the planet’s magnetosphere through the cusp region.  Because the solar wind exists at all times and not just times of solar flares, the magnetopause is a permanent feature of the space near any planet with a magnetic field.

The magnetic field lines of the planet’s magnetic field are not stationary.  They are continuously joining or merging with magnetic field lines of the interplanetary magnetic field.  The joined field lines are swept back over the poles into the planetary magnetic tail.  In the tail, the field lines from the planet’s magnetic field are re-joined and start moving toward night-side of the planet. The physics of this process was first explained by Dungey (1961).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dungey|first=J. W.|title=Interplanetary Magnetic Field and the Auroral Zones|journal=Phys. Rev. Lett.|date=Jan 1961|volume=6|issue=2|pages=47–48|url=http://prl.aps.org/|accessdate=12 July 2011|bibcode = 1961PhRvL...6...47D |doi = 10.1103/PhysRevLett.6.47 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

If one assumed that magnetopause was just a boundary between a magnetic field in a vacuum and a plasma with a weak magnetic field embedded in it, then the magnetopause would be defined by electrons and ions penetrating one gyroradius into the magnetic field domain.  Since the gyro-motion of electrons and ions is in opposite directions, an electric current flows along the boundary.  The actual magnetopause is much more complex.&lt;ref&gt;Physics of the Magnetopause, Edited by P. Song, B. U. Ö. Sonnerup, M. F. Thomsen, American Geophys. Union, Washington, D.C., Geophysical Monograph Series, Volume 90, 1995. 447 pages, {{ISBN|0-87590-047-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Estimating the standoff distance to the magnetopause==
If the pressure from particles within the magnetosphere is neglected, it is possible to estimate the distance to the part of the magnetosphere that faces the [[Sun]].  The condition governing this position is that the dynamic [[ram pressure]] from the [[solar wind]] is equal to the magnetic pressure from the [[Earth]]'s [[magnetic field]].
:&lt;math&gt;(\rho v^2)_{sw}\approx \left( \frac{4 B(r)^2}{2\mu_0} \right) _m&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref group="note"&gt;The reason for the factor of 4 is because the magnetic field strength just inside the magnetopause is twice the dipole value for a planar magnetopause&lt;/ref&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; and  &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; are the [[density]] and [[velocity]] of the [[solar wind]], and
''B''(''r'') is the [[Magnetic field|Magnetic field strength of the planet]] in [[SI]] units (''B'' in [[Tesla (unit)|T]], [[Permeability constant|μ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;]] in [[Henry (unit)|H]]/[[metre|m]])

Since the [[dipole]] magnetic field strength varies with distance as &lt;math&gt;1/r^3&lt;/math&gt;  the magnetic field strength can be written as &lt;math&gt;B(r)=B_0/r^3&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;B_0&lt;/math&gt; is the planet's magnetic moment, expressed in &lt;math&gt;[T\cdot m^3]&lt;/math&gt;.
:&lt;math&gt;\rho v^2\approx \frac{2 B_0^2}{r^6 \mu_0}&lt;/math&gt;.
Solving this equation for r leads to an estimate of the distance
:&lt;math&gt;r\approx \sqrt[6]{\frac{2 B_0^2}{\mu_0 \rho v^2}}&lt;/math&gt;

The distance from Earth to the subsolar magnetopause varies over time due to solar activity, but typical distances range from 6 - 15 R&lt;math&gt;_{\oplus}&lt;/math&gt;.

A [[bow shock]] stands upstream from the magnetopause.  It serves to decelerate and deflect the solar wind flow before it reaches the magnetopause. &lt;ref&gt;Imke de Pater and Jack J.

Research on the magnetopause is conducted using the LMN coordinate system (which is set of axes like XYZ). N points normal to the magnetopause outward to the magnetosheath, L lies along the projection of the dipole axis onto the magnetopause (positive northward), and M completes the triad by pointing dawnward.

Venus and Mars do not have a planetary magnetic field and do not have a magnetopause.  The solar wind interacts with the planet’s atmosphere&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Venus and Mars: Atmospheres, Ionospheres and Solar Wind Interactions, Geophysical Monograph Series, Volume 66|date=1992|publisher=Am.

In the case of the Earth’s moon and other bodies without a magnetic field or atmosphere, the body’s surface interacts with the solar wind and a void is created behind the body.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2011">'''Maine Wildlife Management Areas''' ('''WMAs''') are state owned lands managed by the [[Maine Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife]]. The WMAs comprise approximately 100,000 acres and contain a diverse array of habitats, from wetland flowages critical to waterfowl production to the spruce-fir forests of northern Maine on which Canada Lynx, moose and wintering deer are dependent. Spread geographically throughout all counties of the State the properties are available for a multitude of recreational opportunities, with a focus on hunting, fishing and trapping. The focus on offering these types of recreational opportunities is in line with the funding used to acquire such properties, historically accomplished with funding from Federal Aid to Wildlife Restoration and State bonding approved by voters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wildlife Management Areas: Lands: Wildlife: Fish &amp; Wildlife: Maine Dept of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife|url=http://maine.gov/ifw/fish-wildlife/wildlife/lands/wildlife-management-areas/index.html|website=maine.gov|accessdate=22 November 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2458">'''Marina Rikhvanova''' is a Russian [[ecologist]] and leader of the [[Baikal Ecological Wave]] (BEW) organization which protects Siberia’s [[Lake Baikal]] from ecological damage. Lake Baikal, the world’s biggest reservoir of [[fresh water]], is currently under threat from [[industrial pollution]]. In 2008, Rikhvanova was awarded the [[Goldman Environmental Prize]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.times.spb.ru/index.php?action_id=2&amp;story_id=25783 Brave Environmentalist Wins ‘Green Nobel’]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Rikhvanova's concern for the Lake Baikal dates to her years in college, when she wrote a paper on environmental threats posed by a pulp and a paper mill in [[Baikalsk]] that had been dumping contaminants into the lake since the 1960s.  The mill dumped thousands of tons of pollutants into the lake, including [[Dioxins and dioxin-like compounds|dioxin]], which has appeared in Baikal fish and the fat of Baikal seals. When Rikhvanova co-founded a non-governmental organization called Baikal Ecological Wave in 1990, she targeted the mill. Rikhvanova organized demonstrations, petitions and meetings, all aimed at bringing an end to the mill's pollution of Baikal. Last year, Russian authorities ordered the Baikalsk plant to switch to a closed water treatment system that eliminated any wastewater discharge into the lake.&lt;ref name=lak&gt;[http://www.courant.com/news/nationworld/chi-russia-lake_rodriguezjan04,0,606452.story In Russia, environmentalist's concern runs deep for Lake Baikal]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, Putin decided to reroute an oil pipeline that would have been built within a half-mile of Baikal, near a fault line. This followed protest rallies by thousands of Russians in the streets of Irkutsk.&lt;ref name=lak/&gt;

Rikhvanova has paid a price for her advocacy. Russian police have raided her offices and seized her organization's computers. In 2008, a group of Russian youths attacked a tent camp Rikhvanova had organized to protest a proposed uranium enrichment center in [[Angarsk]], about 50 miles west of Baikal.&lt;ref name=lak/&gt;

'''Moulding''' (also spelled '''molding''' in the United States though usually not within the industry), also known as '''coving''' &lt;small&gt;(United Kingdom, Australia)&lt;/small&gt;, is a strip of material with various profiles used to cover transitions between surfaces or for decoration.  It is traditionally made from solid [[Millwork (building material)|milled wood]] or plaster, but may be of plastic or reformed wood.  In [[classical architecture]] and sculpture, the molding is often carved in marble or other [[List of stone|stone]]s.

A "plain" moulding has right-angled upper and lower edges. A "sprung" moulding has upper and lower edges that [[bevel]] towards its rear,  allowing mounting between two non-parallel planes (such as a wall and a ceiling), with an open space behind.

==Types==
[[File:Moldings on the Table of architecture.jpg|thumb|right|Moldings from 1728 [[:Image:Table of architecture, Cyclopaedia, 1728, volume 1.jpg|Table of architecture]] in the ''[[Cyclopaedia, or Universal Dictionary of Arts and Sciences|Cyclopedia]]''&lt;ref name="cy" /&gt;]]

Decorative moldings have been made of [[wood]], [[Rock (geology)|stone]] and [[cement]]. Recently moldings have been made of [[extruded]] [[PVC]] and Expanded [[Polystyrene]] (EPS) as a core with a cement-based protective coating. Synthetic moldings have environmental, health and safety concerns that were investigated by Doroudiani ''et al''.&lt;ref&gt;S. Doroudiani and H. Omidian. "Environmental, health and safety concerns of decorative mouldings made of expanded polystyrene in buildings", ''Building and Environment'' (2010) 45, pp. 647-654.&lt;/ref&gt;

Common moldings include:
*'''[[Astragal]]''' — Semi-circular molding attached to one of a pair of doors to cover the gap where they meet.
*'''Baguette''' — Thin, half-round molding, smaller than an astragal, sometimes carved, and enriched with [[foliage]]s, [[pearl]]s, [[ribband]]s, [[Bay laurel|laurel]]s, etc. When enriched with ornaments, it was also called ''chapelet''.&lt;ref name="cy"&gt;{{1728}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Bandelet''' — Any little band or flat molding, which crowns a Doric [[architrave]]. It is also called a [[Taenia (architecture)|tenia]] (from Greek ταινία an article of clothing in the form of a ribbon.&lt;ref name="cy" /&gt;
*'''[[Baseboard]]''', "base molding" or "skirting board" — Used to conceal the junction of an interior [[wall]] and [[floor]], to protect the wall from impacts and to add decorative features. A "speed base" makes use of a base "cap molding" set on top of a plain 1" thick board, however there are hundreds of baseboard profiles.
*'''Baton''' — See Torus
*'''[[Batten]]''' or '''board and batten''' — Symmetrical molding that is placed across a joint where two parallel panels or boards meet
*'''Bead molding''' — Narrow, half-round convex molding, when repeated forms ''reeding'' 
*'''Beading''' or '''bead''' —  Molding in the form of a row of half spherical beads, larger than ''pearling''
**Other forms: Bead and leaf, bead and reel, bead and spindle
*'''Beak''' —  Small fillet molding left on the edge of a [[larmier]], which forms a canal, and makes a kind of [[pendant]].&lt;ref name="cy" /&gt; See also: chin-beak
*'''Bed molding''' — Narrow molding used at the junction of a wall and [[ceiling]]. Bed moldings can be either sprung or plain.
*'''[[Bolection]]''' — Raised molding projecting proud of a face frame at the intersection of the different levels between the frame and an inset panel on a door or wood panel. It will sometimes have a [[rabbet]] on its underside the depth of the lower level so it can lay flat over both.  It can leave an inset panel free to expand or contract with temperature and humidity.
* '''Cable molding''' or '''ropework''' — Convex molding carved in imitation of a twisted rope or cord, and used for decorative moldings of the [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque style]] in England, France and Spain and adapted for 18th-century silver and furniture design ([[Thomas Sheraton]])&lt;ref name="do"&gt;Lewis, Philippa &amp; Gillian Darley (1986) ''Dictionary of Ornament'', NY: Pantheon&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Cabled fluting''' or '''cable''' — Convex circular molding sunk in the concave fluting of a classic column, and rising about one-third of the height of the shaft&lt;ref name="cy" /&gt;
*'''[[Casing (moulding)|Casing]]''' — Finish trim around the sides of a [[door]] or [[window]] opening covering the gap between finished wall and the jam or frame it is attached to.
* '''[[Cartouche (design)|Cartouche]]''' {{fr icon}} ''escutcheon'' — Framed panel in the form of a scroll with an inscribed centre, or surrounded by compound moldings decorated with floral motifs  
*'''[[Cavetto]]''' — {{it icon}} ''cavare''("to hollow"): Concave, quarter-round molding sometimes employed in the place of the cymatium of a cornice, as in the Doric order of the [[Theatre of Marcellus]]. It forms the crowning feature of the [[Egyptian temples]], and took the place of the cymatium in many of the [[Etruscan architecture|Etruscan]] temples.
*'''[[Chair rail]]''' — Horizontal molding placed part way up a wall to protect the surface from [[chair]]-backs, and used simply as decoration
* '''[[Chamfer]]''' — [[Beveled]] edge connecting two adjacent surfaces
*'''Chin-beak''' — Concave [[quarter-round]] molding, rare in ancient buildings, more common today.&lt;ref name="cy" /&gt;
*'''Corner guard''' — Used to protect the edge of the wall at an outside corner, or to cover a joint on an inside corner.
*'''Cove molding''' or '''Coving''' — Concave-profile molding that is used at the junction of an interior wall and ceiling
*'''[[Crown molding]]''' — Wide, sprung molding that is used at the junction of an interior wall and ceiling. General term for any molding at the top or "crowning" an architectural element. 
*'''Cyma''' — Molding of double curvature, combining the convex ''ovolo'' and concave ''cavetto''. When the concave part is uppermost, it is called a ''cyma recta'' but if the convex portion is at the top, it is called a ''Cyma reversa''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Cyma |volume=7 |page=690}}&lt;/ref&gt; — Crowning molding at the entablature is of the cyma form, it is called a [[cymatium]].
* '''[[Dentil]]s''' — Small blocks spaced evenly along the bottom edge of the cornice
*'''Drip cap''' — Moulding placed over a door or window opening to prevent water from flowing under the siding or across the glass
* '''Echinus''' — Similar to the ovolo molding and found beneath the abacus of the Doric capital or decorated with the [[egg-and-dart]] pattern below the Ionic capital&lt;ref name="do" /&gt;
* '''[[Egg-and-dart]]''' — egg shapes alternating with ''V''-shapes; one of the most widely used classical moldings.&lt;ref name="do" /&gt; 
** Also: Egg and tongue, egg and anchor, egg and star
*'''Fillet''' — Small, flat band separating two surfaces, or between the flutes of a column
* '''Fluting''' — Vertical, half-round grooves cut into the surface of a column in regular intervals, each separated by a flat ''astragal''. This ornament was used for all but the [[Tuscan order]]
*'''Godroon''' or '''Gadroon''' — Ornamental band with the appearance of beading or reeding, especially frequent in silverwork and molding. It comes from the Latin word ''Guttus'', meaning flask. It is said to be derived from raised work on linen, applied in France to varieties of the, bead and reel, in which the bead is often carved with ornament. In England the term is constantly used by auctioneers to describe the raised convex decorations under the bowl of stone or terracotta vases. The godroons radiate from the vertical support of the vase and rise halfway up the bowl.
**Also: [[Gadrooning]], lobed decoration, (k)nukked decoration, thumb molding
* '''[[Guilloché]]''' — Interlocking curved bands in a repeating pattern often forming circles enriched with rosettes and found in [[Assyria]]n ornament, [[classical architecture|classical]] and [[Renaissance architecture]].&lt;ref name="do" /&gt;
*'''Keel molding'''  — Sharp-edged moulding resembling a cross-section of a ship's [[keel]], common in the [[Early English Period|Early English]] and Decorated styles.
*'''[[Muntin]]''' — Narrow strip of wood or metal separating and holding panes of glass in a window.
*'''[[Ogee]]''' — see "Cyma"
*'''[[Ovolo]]''' — Simple, convex [[quarter-round]] molding that can also be enriched with the egg-and-dart or other pattern

*'''[[Rosette (design)|Rosette]]''' — Circular, floral decorative element found in [[Mesopotamia]]n design and early Greek ''[[stele]]'', common in [[revival style]]s of architecture since the Renaissance.&lt;ref name="do" /&gt;
*'''Scotia''' — Concave molding with a lower edge projecting beyond the top and so used at the base of columns as a transition between two torus moldings with different diameters&lt;ref name="do" /&gt;
*'''Screen molding''' — Small molding used to hide and reinforce where a screen is attached to its frame.
*'''Shoe molding''', '''toe molding''' or [[quarter-round]] — Small flexible moulding used at the junction of a baseboard and floor as a stylistic element or to cover any gap between the two.
*'''[[Strapwork]]''' - Imitates thick lengths of leather straps applied to a surface to produce pattern of ribs in connected circles, squares, scrolls, lozenges etc. Popular in England in 16th &amp; 17th. centuries, used in plaster on ceilings,&lt;ref&gt;See drawings of period ceilings in Bankart, George, "The Art of the Plasterer", 1908; also Millar, William, "Plastering, Plain &amp; Decorative", 1897&lt;/ref&gt; also sculpted in stone on exterior of buildings, e.g. around entrance doors. Also carved in wood, and used for [[topiary]] designs for [[parterre]]s. 
* '''Torus''' — Convex, semi-circular molding, larger than an astragal, often at the base of a column, which may be enriched with leaves or plaiting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Torus |volume=27 |page=79}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At their simplest, moldings hide and help weather seal natural joints produced in the framing process of building a structure. As decorative elements they are a means of applying light- and dark-shaded stripes to a structural object without having to change the material or apply [[pigments]]. Depending on their function they may be primarily a means of hiding or weather-sealing a joint, purely decorative, or some combination of the three. 

As decorative elements the contrast of dark and light areas gives definition to the object. Imagine the vertical surface of a wall lit by sunlight at an angle of about 45 degrees above the wall. Adding a small overhanging horizontal molding to the surface of the wall will introduce a dark horizontal shadow below the molding, called a [[Annulet (architecture)|fillet]] molding. Adding a vertical fillet to a horizontal surface will create a light vertical shadow. Graded shadows are possible by using moldings in different shapes: the [[Concave polygon|concave]] ''cavetto'' molding produces a horizontal shadow that is darker at the top and lighter at the bottom; an ''[[ovolo]]'' ([[Convex polygon|convex]]) molding makes a shadow that is lighter at the top and darker at the bottom. Other varieties of concave molding are the ''scotia'' and ''congé'' and other convex moldings the ''echinus'', the ''[[torus]]'' and the astragal.

Placing an ovolo directly above a cavetto forms a smooth ''s''-shaped curve with vertical ends that is called an ''ogee'' or ''cyma reversa'' molding. Its shadow appears as a band light at the top and bottom but dark in the interior. Similarly, a cavetto above an ovolo forms an ''s'' with horizontal ends, called a ''cyma'' or ''cyma recta''. Its shadow shows two dark bands with a light interior.

Together the basic elements and their variants form a [[decorative]] [[vocabulary]] that can be assembled and rearranged in endless combinations. This vocabulary is at the core of both [[classical architecture]] and [[Gothic architecture]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3073">[[Image:Simpson_&amp;_Gentry_at_ROB.jpg|thumb|NHRP opening day]]'''The National Hurricane Research Project''' (NHRP) was initiated in 1955 by the 
[[United States Weather Bureau]] in response to the devastating 1954 hurricane season, which 
saw [[Hurricane Carol]], [[Hurricane Edna]], and [[Hurricane Hazel]] bring destruction and 
flooding to New England and the  Mid-Atlantic states.  
[[Bob_Simpson (meteorologist)|Robert Simpson]], a Weather Bureau meteorologist who had 
participated in Air Force hurricane reconnaissance flights as an observer, was appointed as 
the first director of NHRP and organized the Research Operations Base at Morrison Air Force 
Base (now [[Palm Beach International Airport]]) in West Palm Beach, FL in 1956.

During the first three years of the Project, scientists used three specially 
instrumented Air Force [[Hurricane Hunters]] aircraft with crews on bailment from the 55th  
Weather Reconnaissance Squadron.  They flew missions into [[Hurricane Greta (1956)|Hurricane Greta]] (1956), 
[[Hurricane Audrey]] (1957), 
[[1958_Atlantic_hurricane_season#Hurricane_Daisy|Hurricane Daisy]] (1958), 
and [[Hurricane Helene (1958)]] in this initial period, collecting data which delineated the 
structure and energy budget of hurricanes for the first time.

In 1959, the Project was moved to Miami and collocated with the Miami hurricane forecast 
office.  Simpson left the Project to complete his doctoral degree and Robert Cecil Gentry 
was appointed NHRP director.  The [[Department of Commerce]] leased two DC-6 aircraft and 
received a B-57 jet from the Air Force so  that NHRP could continue to carry out airborne 
experiments on hurricanes.  The combination of research project, forecast center, and 
aircraft facility was dubbed the "[[National Hurricane Center]]" (NHC).  This has caused 
later confusion, since 1967 the NHC name has been used exclusively by the forecast center.  
However the Project and Research Flight Facility (RFF) remained separate entities, with 
their own personnel, budgets, and objectives.

During the 1960s, while NHRP continued to carry out research flights into 
[[Hurricane Donna]] (1960), [[Hurricane Cleo]] (1964), and [[Hurricane Betsy]] (1965), the 
Project also began to create computer models of hurricane circulation, formulated a 
statistical track program (NHC-64), wrote a manual on hurricane forecasting, and evaluate 
the accuracy of track forecasts.  Starting with [[Hurricane Esther (1961)]], NHRP was 
heavily involved with [[Project STORMFURY]], the U. S. Government's experiment in hurricane 
modification.  They seeded Hurricane Beulah in 1963, but had to wait six more years before a 
suitable candidate storm entered their operational area.

Late in 1964, the Project was renamed the [[National Hurricane Research Laboratory]] in 
recognition of it becoming a permanent institution within the Weather Bureau. This presaged 
the creation of the Environmental Research Laboratories the next year.

'''Northumberland Wildlife Trust''' was established in 1971 (following a split from the ''Northumberland &amp; Durham Trust'', established 1962) to help conserve and protect the [[wildlife]] of [[Northumberland]], [[Newcastle upon Tyne]] and [[North Tyneside]] in the [[United Kingdom|UK]]. The Trust is a charity, and a member of [[The Wildlife Trusts partnership]].

==About==
The Trust was founded by Tony Tynan, and to honour that fact he has been given the title of Founder.

Particular projects where the Trust has a special expertise include [[Red Squirrel]] conservation and [[peat]]land restoration.

The Trust has an active team engaged in education activities including projects based in North Northumberland, Blyth Valley district and Newcastle and North Tyneside.  It runs activities in which volunteers can participate every Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday and alternate Sundays.  Volunteers help to maintain the Trust's nature reserves.

The Trust is a charity and relies heavily on its members to help fund its activities.

==Reserves==
The Trust manages 60 [[nature]] reserves including [[Hauxley]] and [[East Chevington]] on the Northumberland Coast to [[Whitelee Moor]], a 15 square kilometre hill farm on the Scottish Border.   The most recent acquisition was the beach at Cresswell.  In addition to its nature reserves, the Trust manages Weetslade Country Park on behalf of the Land Restoration Trust and [[Bakethin Reservoir]] conservation area on behalf of Northumbrian Water.

==Headquarters==
Northumberland Wildlife Trust headquarters are located on one their reserves, St. Nicholas Park, [[Gosforth]]. most of the Trust's staff are based here, as are part of the Save Our Squirrels Northumberland.

The OGA's headquarters are in [[Aberdeen]] with another office in London, which is also its registered company address.

== History ==
In June 2013, the [[UK government]] asked Sir [[Ian Wood (businessman)|Ian Wood]] of [[Wood Group]] to conduct a review into maximising the recovery of oil and gas from the [[UK Continental Shelf]]. One of the recommendations of the [[Wood Review]] was the creation of an independent [[economic regulator]] for the sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.woodreview.co.uk/|title=Wood Review|publisher=Wood Review|accessdate=9 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently the OGA was launched on 1 April 2015 as an [[executive agency]] of DECC. The Energy Act 2016 , which received Royal Assent in May 2016, created the legislative framework to formally establish the OGA as a government company, limited by shares under the Companies Act 2006,with the Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy the sole shareholder. The Energy Act 2016 also provided the OGA with new regulatory powers, including the ability to participate in meetings with operators, to have access to data, provide dispute resolution and introduce a range of sanctions such as enforcement notices and fines of up to £1 million.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4871">An '''Oxyliquit''', also called '''liquid air explosive''' or '''liquid oxygen explosive''', is an [[explosive material]] which is a mixture of  [[liquid oxygen]] (LOX) with a suitable fuel, such as carbon (as [[lampblack]]), or an organic chemical (e.g. a mixture of [[soot]] and [[naphthalene]]), wood meal, or [[aluminium]] powder or sponge.  It is a class of [[Sprengel explosive]]s.

==Properties==
Oxyliquits have numerous advantages. They are inexpensive to make, can be initiated by a [[safety fuse]], and in case of a misfire, the oxygen evaporates quickly, rendering the charge quite safe in a short period of time. The first large scale deployment took place in 1899 during the building of the [[Simplon Tunnel]], in the form of cartridges filled with [[diatomaceous earth]] soaked with [[petroleum]], or an absorbent cork [[charcoal]], dipped in liquid oxygen immediately before use. In another modification, the cartridge is filled with liquid oxygen after placement in the [[borehole]]. 

One of the disadvantages of oxyliquits is that, once mixed, they are sensitive to sparks, shock, and heat, in addition to reported cases of spontaneous ignition. The power relative to weight is high, but the density is low, so the [[brisance]] is low as well. Ignition by a fuse alone is sometimes unreliable. The charge should be detonated within 5 minutes of soaking, but even after 15 minutes it may be capable of exploding, even though weaker and with production of [[carbon dioxide]]. 

An oxyliquit explosive can be made accidentally by spilling liquid oxygen on [[Asphalt concrete|tarmac]] during filling high-altitude airplane systems. The pavement then can become sufficiently explosive to be initiated by walking on it, although the oxygen evaporates shortly after spilling.{{cn|date=May 2018}}

At first, liquid air, self-enriched by standing ([[nitrogen]] has a lower [[boiling point]] and evaporates preferentially) was used, but pure liquid oxygen gives better results.

A mixture of lampblack and liquid oxygen was measured to have [[detonation velocity]] of 3,000&amp;nbsp;m/s, and 4 to 12% more strength than [[dynamite]]. However, the flame it makes has too long duration to be safe in possible presence of explosive gases, so oxyliquits found their use mostly in open [[quarry|quarries]] and [[strip mining]]. 
&lt;!-- http://groups-beta.google.com/group/alt.engr.explosives/browse_thread/thread/fccadea273ae274e/94a74830900b6b43?q=oxyliquit&amp;rnum=5&amp;hl=en
 --&gt;

==History==
The explosive properties of these mixtures were discovered in [[Germany]] in 1895  by Prof. [[Carl von Linde]], a developer of a successful machine for liquefaction of gases, who named them oxyliquits.

In 1930, over 3 million [[pound (mass)|pounds]] of liquid oxygen were used for this purpose in Germany alone, and additional 201,466&amp;nbsp;lb (91,383&amp;nbsp;kg) were consumed by British [[quarries]]. The accident rate was lower than with conventional explosives. However, the [[Dewar flask]]s the LOX was stored in occasionally exploded, which was caused by iron impurities in the activated carbon serving as trace gas absorbent in the insulation vacuum layer in the flask, which caused spontaneous ignition in case of LOX leak into the enclosed space.

Use of oxyliquits during [[World War II]] was low, as there was a plentiful supply of nitrates obtained from synthetic [[ammonia]].

Due to the complicated machinery required for manufacture of liquid oxygen, oxyliquit explosives were used mostly only where their consumption was high. In the [[United States]], some such locations were the [[strip mine]]s in [[coal mining]] areas of the [[Midwest]]. Its consumption peaked in 1953 with 10,190 tons{{Vague|which tons?|date=February 2009}}, but then decreased to zero in 1968, when it was entirely replaced with the cheaper [[ANFO]].

==Fiction==
Oxyliquit explosive was prepared ''ad hoc'' from [[sugar]] and [[liquid oxygen]] from an oxygen bottle to blast a hole in a collapsed cave in [[Stanisław Lem]]'s 1951 novel ''[[The Astronauts]]''.  The same device was used in [[Andy_Weir_(writer)|Andy Weir's]] novel ''[[The Martian (Weir novel)|The Martian]]'' to cause the intentional depressurization of a spaceship by blasting the airlock door.

[[File:Energiepark Lauingen Gehrlicher Solar AG.JPG|thumb|alt=Solar park|250px|The 25.7 MW [[Lauingen Energy Park]] in [[Bavarian Swabia]], Germany]]
A '''photovoltaic power station''', also known as a '''solar park''', is a large-scale [[photovoltaic system]] (PV system) designed for the supply of [[Electricity market#Wholesale electricity market|merchant power]] into the [[Electrical grid|electricity grid]]. They are differentiated from most building-mounted and other decentralised solar power applications because they supply power at the [[utility]] level, rather than to a local user or users. They are sometimes also referred to as '''solar farms''' or '''solar ranches''', especially when sited in agricultural areas. The generic expression '''utility-scale solar''' is sometimes used to describe this type of project.

The [[solar power]] source is via [[Solar panel|photovoltaic modules]] that convert light directly to electricity. However, this differs from, and should not be confused with [[concentrated solar power]], the other large-scale solar generation technology, which uses heat to drive a variety of conventional generator systems. Both approaches have their own advantages and disadvantages, but to date, for a variety of reasons, [[photovoltaic]] technology has seen much wider use in the field. {{As of|2013}}, PV systems outnumber concentrators by about 40 to 1.

In some countries, the [[nameplate capacity]] of a photovoltaic power stations is rated in [[megawatt-peak]] (MW&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;), which refers to the theoretical maximum solar array's [[Direct current|DC]] power output. In other countries, the manufacturer gives the surface and the efficiency. However, Canada, Japan, Spain and some parts of the United States often specify using the converted lower nominal power output in [[watt-peak AC|MW&lt;sub&gt;AC&lt;/sub&gt;]]; a measure directly comparable to other forms of power generation. A third and less common rating is the [[volt-ampere|mega volt-amperes]] (MVA). Most solar parks are developed at a scale of at least 1&amp;nbsp;MW&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;. As at the start of 2017, the [[List of photovoltaic power stations|world's largest]] operating photovoltaic power station has a capacity of over 800 [[megawatt]]s and projects up to 1 [[gigawatt]] are planned. As at the end of 2016, about 4,300 projects with a combined capacity of 96&amp;nbsp;GW&lt;sub&gt;AC&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Global installierte Photovoltaik-Kraftwerksleistung nähert sich der 100-Gigawatt-Marke|url=http://www.solarserver.de/solar-magazin/nachrichten/aktuelles/2017/kw09/global-installierte-photovoltaik-leistung-naehert-sich-der-100-gigawatt-marke.html|accessdate=4 March 2017|publisher=SolarServer|date=2 March 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170305034612/http://www.solarserver.de/solar-magazin/nachrichten/aktuelles/2017/kw09/global-installierte-photovoltaik-leistung-naehert-sich-der-100-gigawatt-marke.html|archivedate=5 March 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Another record year for utility-scale solar takes cumulative capacity close to 100 GW|url=http://wiki-solar.org/library/public/170302_Utility-solar_2016_figures_near_100GW.pdf|accessdate=4 March 2017|publisher=Wiki-solar|date=2 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; were solar farms larger than 4&amp;nbsp;MW&lt;sub&gt;AC&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wiki-solar.org/region/continents/index.html |title=Wiki-Solar Database, Deployment of utility-scale solar power by continent |publisher=WikiSolar |accessdate=4 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the existing large-scale photovoltaic power stations are owned and operated by independent power producers, but the involvement of community- and utility-owned projects is increasing. To date, almost all have been supported at least in part by regulatory incentives such as [[feed-in tariff]]s or [[Tax credit#Renewable Energy/Investment Tax Credit (ITC)|tax credits]], but as [[levelized cost]]s have fallen significantly in the last decade and [[grid parity]] has been reached in an increasing number of markets, it may not be long before external incentives cease to exist.

== Siting and land use ==

The land area required for a desired power output, varies depending on the location,&lt;ref name=Statistics /&gt; and on the efficiency of the solar modules,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Joshi|first=Amruta|title=Estimating per unit area energy output from solar PV modules|url=http://www.ncpre.iitb.ac.in/page.php?pageid=51|publisher=National Centre for Photovoltaic Research and Education|accessdate=5 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; the slope of the site&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Screening Sites for Solar PV Potential|url=http://www.epa.gov/oswercpa/docs/solar_decision_tree.pdf|work=Solar Decision Tree|publisher=US Environmental Protection Agency|accessdate=5 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and the type of mounting used. Fixed tilt solar arrays using typical modules of about 15% efficiency&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=An overview of PV panels|url=https://solarjuice.com/articles/pvs/|publisher=SolarJuice|accessdate=5 March 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150430040849/https://solarjuice.com/articles/pvs/|archivedate=30 April 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  on horizontal sites, need about 1 [[hectare]]/MW in the tropics and this figure rises to over 2 [[hectare]]s in northern Europe.&lt;ref name=Statistics /&gt;

Because of the longer shadow the array casts when tilted at a steeper angle,&lt;ref name=tilt_spacing&gt;{{cite web|title=Calculating Inter-Row Spacing|url=http://energytrust.org/trade-ally/updates-and-events/InsiderNewsletter/insider-pdfs/100304_solarprofessional_article.pdf|work=Technical Questions &amp; Answers|publisher=Solar Pro Magazine|accessdate=5 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; this area is typically about 10% higher for an adjustable tilt array or a single axis tracker, and 20% higher for a 2-axis tracker,&lt;ref name=Wolfe_book&gt;{{cite book|last=Wolfe|first=Philip|title=Solar Photovoltaic Projects in the Mainstream Power Market|date=2012|publisher=Routledge|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0-415-52048-5|page=240|url=http://www.routledge.com/books/details/9780415520485/}}&lt;/ref&gt; though these figures will vary depending on the latitude and topography.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Solar Radiation on a Tilted Surface|url=http://pveducation.org/pvcdrom/properties-of-sunlight/solar-radiation-on-tilted-s|publisher=PVEducation.org|accessdate=22 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The best locations for solar parks in terms of land use are held to be brown field sites, or where there is no other valuable land use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Solar parks: maximising environmental benefits|url=http://publications.naturalengland.org.uk/file/102004|publisher=Natural England|accessdate=30 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even in cultivated areas, a significant proportion of the site of a solar farm can also be devoted to other productive uses, such as crop growing&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Person County Solar Park Makes Best Use of Solar Power and Sheep|url=http://www.solarenergy.net/News/8310901-person-county-solar-park-makes-best-use-of-solar-power-and-shee|publisher=solarenergy|accessdate=22 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Person County Solar Park One|url=http://carolinasolarenergy.com/|publisher=Carolina Solar Energy|accessdate=22 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; or biodiversity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Solar Parks – Opportunities for Biodiversity|url=http://www.unendlich-viel-energie.de/en/details/article/523/solar-parks-opportunities-for-biodiversit|publisher=German Renewable Energies Agency|accessdate=22 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Agrivoltaics===
[[Agrivoltaics]] is co-developing the same area of [[land]] for both solar [[photovoltaic]] power as well as for conventional [[agriculture]]. A recent study found that  the value of solar generated electricity coupled to shade-tolerant crop production created an over 30% increase in economic value from farms deploying agrivoltaic systems instead of conventional agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;Harshavardhan Dinesh, Joshua M. Pearce, [https://www.academia.edu/18406368/The_potential_of_agrivoltaic_systems The potential of agrivoltaic systems], ''Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews'', '''54''', 299-308 (2016). &lt;/ref&gt;

=== Co-location ===
In some cases several different solar power stations, with separate owners and contractors, are developed on adjacent sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Addendum to conditional use permit|url=http://www.co.kern.ca.us/planning/pdfs/eirs/recurrent_desert/re_tehachapi_pc_sr_111011.pdf|publisher=Kern County Planning and Community development Department|accessdate=22 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can offer the advantage of the projects sharing the cost and risks of project infrastructure such as grid connections and planning approval.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Smart Grid transmission scheme for Evacuation of Solar Power|url=http://rtf.main.jp/wp-content/uploads/Technical-Brief-Smart-GRID-PDPU1.pdf|work=Workshop on smart grid development|publisher=Pandit Deendayal Petroleum University|accessdate=5 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Solar farms can also be co-located with wind farms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=E.ON’s Solar PV Portfolio|url=http://www.eon.com/en/business-areas/power-generation/solar/photovoltaics/projects.html|publisher=E.On|accessdate=22 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes the title 'solar park' is used, rather than an individual solar power station.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Solar parks: maximising environmental benefits|url=http://publications.naturalengland.org.uk/file/102004|publisher=Natural England|accessdate=22 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=First solar park set for Upington, Northern Cape|url=http://www.tradeinvestsa.co.za/business-opportunities/1217742.htm|publisher=Frontier Market Intelligence|accessdate=22 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some examples of such solar clusters are the [[Charanka Solar Park]], where there are 17 different generation projects; Neuhardenberg,&lt;ref name=Neuhardenberg /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Solarpark Neuhardenberg - site plan|url=http://wiki-solar.org/map/sites/index.html?Solarpark_Neuhardenberg?u?14?52.61?14.24 |publisher= [[Wiki-Solar]] |accessdate= 1 Jan 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; with eleven plants, and the Golmud solar parks with total reported capacity over 500MW.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Qinghai leads in photovoltaic power |url= http://usa.chinadaily.com.cn/business/2012-03/02/content_14744509.htm |accessdate= 21 February 2013 |newspaper= China Daily |date= 2 Mar 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Golmud&gt;{{cite web |title= Golmud Desert Solar Park - satellite view |url= http://wiki-solar.org/map/sites/index.html?Golmud_Desert_Cluster?a?12?36.37?95.18|publisher=[[Wiki-Solar]]|accessdate=30 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; An extreme example is calling all of the solar farms in the [[Gujarat]] state of India a single solar park, the [[Gujarat Solar Park]].

== Technology ==

Most Solar parks are [[Photovoltaic mounting system#Ground mounted|ground mounted]] PV systems, also known as free-field solar power plants.&lt;ref name=Free_field&gt;

=== Solar array arrangements ===

The [[solar array]]s are the subsystems which convert incoming light into electrical energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Solar cells and photovoltaic arrays|url=http://www.alternative-energy-news.info/technology/solar-power/photo-voltaics/|work=Photovoltaics|publisher=Alternative Energy News|accessdate=5 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They comprise a multitude of [[solar module]]s, mounted on support structures and interconnected to deliver a power output to electronic power conditioning subsystems.&lt;ref name=system_schematic&gt;{{cite web|last=Kymakis|first=Emmanuel|display-authors=etal|title=Performance analysis of a grid connected photovoltaic park on the island of Crete|url=http://www.physics.arizona.edu/~cronin/Solar/References/Shade%20effects/sdarticle%20(16).pdf|publisher=Elsevier|accessdate=30 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A minority of utility-scale solar parks are configured on buildings&lt;ref name=SolarServer&gt;{{cite web|title=Solar Report: Large photovoltaic power plants: average growth by almost 100 % since 2005|url=http://www.solarserver.com/solar-magazine/solar-report/solar-report/large-photovoltaic-power-plants.html|publisher=SolarServer|accessdate=30 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and so use [[bipv|building-mounted]] solar arrays. The majority are 'free field' systems using ground-mounted structures,&lt;ref name=Free_field /&gt; usually of one of the following types:

==== Fixed arrays ====



Many projects use mounting structures where the solar modules are mounted at a [[solar tracker#Fixed mount|fixed]] inclination calculated to provide the optimum annual output profile.&lt;ref name=mounting_tilt /&gt; The modules are normally oriented towards the Equator, at a tilt angle slightly less than the latitude of the site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mounting solar panels|url=http://www.24volt.co.uk/info/SolarPanels/MountingSolarPanels|publisher=24 volt|accessdate=5 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In some cases, depending on local climatic, topographical or electricity pricing regimes, different tilt angles can be used, or the arrays might be offset from the normal East-West axis to favour morning or evening output.&lt;ref name=SEAI&gt;{{cite web|title=Best Practice Guide for Photovoltaics (PV)|url=http://www.seai.ie/Publications/Renewables_Publications/Solar_Energy/Best_Practice_Guide_for_PV.pdf|publisher=Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland|accessdate=30 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A variant on this design is the use of arrays, whose tilt angle can be adjusted twice or four times annually to optimise seasonal output.&lt;ref name=mounting_tilt /&gt; They also require more land area to reduce internal shading at the steeper winter tilt angle.&lt;ref name=tilt_spacing /&gt; Because the increased output is typically only a few percent, it seldom justifies the increased cost and complexity of this design.&lt;ref name=Wolfe_book /&gt;

==== Dual axis trackers ====

[[File:Parc fotovoltaic de Bellpuig I.JPG|thumb|Bellpuig Solar Park near [[Lerida|Lerida, Spain]] uses pole-mounted 2-axis trackers]]
To maximise the intensity of incoming direct radiation, solar panels should be orientated normal to the sun's rays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=PV Energy Conversion Efficiency|url=http://www.eyesolarlux.com/Solar-simulation-energy.htm|work=Solar Energy|publisher=Solarlux|accessdate=5 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  To achieve this, arrays can be designed using [[solar tracker#Dual axis trackers|two-axis trackers]], capable of tracking the sun in its daily orbit across the sky, and as its elevation changes throughout the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mousazadeh|first=Hossain|display-authors=etal|title=A review of principle and sun-tracking methods for maximizing|url=http://xa.yimg.com/kq/groups/22199541/1797755549/name/A%252Breview%252Bof%252Bprinciple%252Band%252Bsun-tracking%252Bmethods%252Bfor%252Bmaximizing.pdf|work=Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews 13 (2009) 1800–1818|publisher=Elsevier|accessdate=30 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These arrays need to be spaced out to reduce inter-shading as the sun moves and the array orientations change, so need more land area.&lt;ref name=Trackers_REW&gt;{{cite web|last=Appleyard|first=David|title=Solar Trackers: Facing the Sun|url=http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/rea/news/article/2009/06/solar-trackers-facing-the-sun|publisher=Renewable Energy World|accessdate=5 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They also require more complex mechanisms to maintain the array surface at the required angle. The increased output can be of the order of 30%&lt;ref name=Trackers&gt;{{cite web|last=Suri|first=Marcel|display-authors=etal|title=Solar Electricity Production from Fixed-inclined and Sun-tracking c-Si Photovoltaic Modules in|url=http://geomodelsolar.eu/_docs/papers/2012/Suri-et-al--SASEC2012--PV-potential-in-South-Africa.pdf|work=Proceedings of 1st Southern African Solar Energy Conference (SASEC 2012), 21–23 May 2012, Stellenbosch, South Africa|publisher=GeoModel Solar, Bratislava, Slovakia|accessdate=30 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; in locations with high levels of [[direct insolation|direct radiation]], but the increase is lower in temperate climates or those with more significant [[diffuse sky radiation|diffuse radiation]], due to overcast conditions. For this reason, dual axis trackers are most commonly used in subtropical regions,&lt;ref name=Trackers_REW /&gt; and were first deployed at utility scale at the Lugo plant.&lt;ref name=Lugo /&gt;

==== Single axis trackers ====

A third approach achieves some of the output benefits of tracking, with a lesser penalty in terms of land area, capital and operating cost. This involves tracking the sun in one dimension – in its daily journey across the sky – but not adjusting for the seasons.&lt;ref name=NREL_tracker&gt;{{cite web|last=Shingleton|first=J|title=One-Axis Trackers – Improved Reliability, Durability, Performance, and Cost Reduction|url=http://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy08osti/42769.pdf|publisher=National Renewable Energy Laboratory|accessdate=30 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The angle of the axis is normally horizontal, though some, such as the solar park at Nellis Airforce Base, which have a 20° tilt,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nellis Air Force Base Solar Power System|url=http://www.nellis.af.mil/shared/media/document/AFD-080117-043.pdf|publisher=US Air Force|accessdate=14 April 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130124054750/http://www.nellis.af.mil/shared/media/document/AFD-080117-043.pdf|archivedate=24 January 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; incline the axis towards the equator in a north-south orientation – effectively a hybrid between tracking and fixed tilt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=T20 Tracker|url=http://www.slocounty.ca.gov/Assets/PL/SunPower+-+High+Plains+Solar+Ranch/Initial+Application+Submittal/18+Appendix+F+-+Product+Data+Sheet+-+T20+Tracker.pdf|work=Data sheet|publisher=SunPower Corporation|accessdate=14 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[solar tracker#Single axis trackers|Single axis tracking systems]] are aligned along axes roughly North-South.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Li|first=Zhimin|display-authors=etal|title=Optical performance of inclined south-north single-axis tracked solar panels|journal=Energy|date=June 2010|volume=10|issue=6|pages=2511–2516|doi=10.1016/j.energy.2010.02.050|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360544210001143|accessdate=5 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some use linkages between rows so that the same actuator can adjust the angle of several rows at once.&lt;ref name=NREL_tracker /&gt;

=== Power conversion ===

Solar panels produce [[direct current]] (DC) electricity, so solar parks need conversion equipment&lt;ref name=system_schematic /&gt; to convert this to [[alternating current]] (AC), which is the form transmitted by the electricity grid. This conversion is done by [[inverter]]s. To maximise their efficiency, solar power plants also incorporate [[maximum power point trackers]], either within the inverters or as separate units. These devices keep each solar array string close to its [[Solar cell efficiency#Maximum power point|peak power point]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/blog/post.cfm?id=invert-your-thinking-squeezing-more-2009-08-26|title=Invert your thinking: Squeezing more power out of your solar panels|publisher=scientificamerican.com|accessdate=9 June 2011|work=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two primary alternatives for configuring this conversion equipment; centralised and string inverters,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.solarnovus.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=634|title=Understanding Inverter Strategies|publisher=Solar Novus Today|accessdate=13 April 2013|work=}}&lt;/ref&gt; although in some cases individual, or [[Solar micro-inverter|micro-inverters]] are used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.solarserver.com/solar-magazine/solar-interviews/solar-interviews/photovoltaic-micro-inverters-advantages-and-challenges-for-rooftop-pv-systems.html|title=Photovoltaic micro-inverters|publisher=SolarServer|accessdate=13 April 2013|work=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Single inverters allows optimizing the output of each panel, and multiple inverters increases the reliability by limiting the loss of output when an inverter fails.&lt;ref name=casestudy/&gt;

==== Centralised inverters ====

[[File:Juwi PV Field.jpg|thumb|[[Waldpolenz Solar Park]]&lt;ref name=Waldpolenz&gt;{{cite web|title=Waldpolenz Solar Park|url=http://www.juwi.com/solar_energy/references/details/waldpolenz_solar_park/de.html|publisher=Juwi|accessdate=13 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; is divided into blocks, each with a centralised inverter]]
These units have relatively high capacity, typically of the order of 1 MW,&lt;ref name=inverters_REW&gt;

==== String inverters ====

[[String inverter]]s are substantially lower in capacity, of the order of 10&amp;nbsp;kW,&lt;ref name=inverters_REW /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Appleyard|first=David|title=Making waves: Inverters continue to push efficiency|url=http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/rea/news/article/2009/01/making-waves__inverters|publisher=Renewable Energy World|accessdate=13 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and condition the output of a single array string. This is normally a whole, or part of, a row of solar arrays within the overall plant. String inverters can enhance the efficiency of solar parks, where different parts of the array are experiencing different levels of insolation, for example where arranged at different orientations, or closely packed to minimise site area.&lt;ref name=casestudy&gt;{{cite web|title=Case study: German solar park chooses decentralized control|url=http://www.solarnovus.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=4798:case-study-german-solar-park-chooses-decentralized-control&amp;catid=77:case-studies-and-solar-solutions&amp;Itemid=440|publisher=Solar Novus|accessdate=13 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== System performance ===
[[File:Photovoltaic power station, Glynn Co, GA, US.jpg|right|thumb|Power station in [[Glynn County, Georgia]] ]]
The performance of a solar park is a function of the climatic conditions, the equipment used and the system configuration. The primary energy input is the global light irradiance in the plane of the solar arrays, and this in turn is a combination of the direct and the diffuse radiation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Myers|first=D R|title=Solar Radiation Modeling and Measurements for Renewable Energy Applications: Data and Model Quality|journal=Proceedings of International Expert Conference on Mathematical Modeling of Solar Radiation and Daylight|date=Sep 2003|url=http://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy03osti/33620.pdf|accessdate=30 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A key determinant of the output of the system is the conversion efficiency of the solar modules, which will depend in particular on the type of [[solar cell]] used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Green|first=Martin|last2=Emery|first2=Keith|last3=Hishikawa|first3=Yoshihiro|last4=Warta|first4=Wilhelm|last-author-amp=yes|title=Solar Cell Efficiency Tables|journal=Progress in Photovoltaics: Research and Applications|date=2009|volume=17|pages=85–94|doi=10.1002/pip.880|url=http://www.scec.sh.cn/scec_file/20100129_110700_953_863.pdf|accessdate=30 December 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120611205431/http://www.scec.sh.cn/scec_file/20100129_110700_953_863.pdf|archivedate=11 June 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There will be losses between the DC output of the solar modules and the AC power delivered to the grid, due to a wide range of factors such as light absorption losses, mismatch, cable voltage drop, conversion efficiencies, and other parasitic losses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Picault|first=D |first2=B.|last2=Raison |title=Forecasting photovoltaic array power production subject to mismatch losses|journal=Solar Energy|date=2010|volume=84|issue=7|pages=1301–1309|url=http://www.physics.arizona.edu/~cronin/Solar/References/PV%20system%20modeling/Forecasting%20PV%20power%20production.pdf|accessdate=5 March 2013|doi=10.1016/j.solener.2010.04.009|last3=Bacha|first3=S.|last4=de la Casa|first4=J.|last5=Aguilera|first5=J.|bibcode=2010SoEn...84.1301P}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A parameter called the 'performance ratio'&lt;ref name=PerfRatio&gt;{{cite web|last=Marion|first=B ()|title=Performance Parameters for Grid-Connected PV Systems|url=http://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy05osti/37358.pdf|publisher=NREL|accessdate=30 August 2012|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; has been developed to evaluate the total value of these losses. The performance ratio gives a measure of the output AC power delivered as a proportion of the total DC power which the solar modules should be able to deliver under the ambient climatic conditions. In modern solar parks the performance ratio should typically be in excess of 80%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Power of PV – Case Studies on Solar Parks in Eastern|url=http://www.renexpo-bucharest.com/fileadmin/Tagungsunterlagen/PV%20Forum/04.%20CSUN.pdf|work=Proceeding Renexpo|publisher=CSun|accessdate=5 March 2013}}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Avenal in ascendance: Taking a closer look at the world’s largest silicon thin-film PV power plant|url=http://www.pv-tech.org/chip_shots_blog/avenal_in_ascendance_taking_a_closer_look_at_the_worlds_largest_silic|publisher=PV-Tech|accessdate=22 April 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150222004326/http://www.pv-tech.org/chip_shots_blog/avenal_in_ascendance_taking_a_closer_look_at_the_worlds_largest_silic|archivedate=22 February 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== System degradation ===

Early photovoltaic systems output decreased as much as 10%/year,&lt;ref name=Carrisa/&gt; but as of 2010 the median degradation rate was 0.5%/year, with modules made after 2000 having a significantly lower degradation rate, so that a system would lose only 12% of its output performance in 25 years. A system using modules which degrade 4%/year will lose 64% of its output during the same period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Outdoor PV Degradation Comparison|url=http://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy11osti/477|publisher=National Renewable Energy Laboratory|accessdate=22 April 2013}} Retrieved 13 April 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Many panel makers offer a performance guarantee, typically 90% in ten years and 80% over 25 years. The output of all panels is typically warranteed at plus or minus 3% during the first year of operation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New Industry Leading Warrantee|url=http://www.recgroup.com/en/products/modules/rec-module-war|publisher=REC Group|accessdate=22 April 2013}} Retrieved 13 April 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Solar power plants are developed to deliver merchant electricity into the grid as an alternative to other renewable, fossil or nuclear generating stations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Alternative Energy|url=http://www.altenergy.org/|publisher=Alternative Energy|accessdate=7 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The plant owner is an electricity generator. Most solar power plants today are owned by [[independent power producer]]s (IPP's),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=independent power producer (IPP), non-utility generator (NUG)|url=https://energyvortex.com/energydictionary/EnergyVortex.htm#independent_power_producer_(ipp)__non_utility_generator_(nug).html|work=Dictionary|publisher=Energy Vortex|accessdate=30 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; though some are held by [[Investor-owned utility|investor-]] or [[Utility cooperative|community-owned]] utilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Investor-owned utility|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/Investor-owned+utility|publisher=The Free Dictionary|accessdate=30 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of these power producers develop their own portfolio of power plants,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Owners and IPPs|url=http://wiki-solar.org/company/owner/index.html|work=Deployment of utility-scale solar parks by company|publisher=[[Wiki-Solar]]|accessdate=5 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  but most solar parks are initially designed and constructed by specialist project developers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wang|first=Ucilia|title=The Crowded Field of Solar Project Development|url=http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/rea/news/article/2012/08/the-crowded-field-of-solar-project-development|publisher=Renewable Energy World|accessdate=30 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typically the developer will plan the project, obtain planning and connection consents, and arrange financing for the capital required.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Leadership across the Entire Value Chain|url=http://www.firstsolar.com/About-First-Solar|publisher=First Solar|accessdate=7 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The actual construction work is normally contracted to one or more [[EPC (contract)|EPC]] (engineering, procurement and construction) contractors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Englander|first=Daniel|title=Solar's New Important Players|url=http://seekingalpha.com/article/138253-solar-s-new-important-players-chevron-lockheed-martin|accessdate=30 December 2012|newspaper=Seeking Alpha|date=18 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Planning approval ===

Photovoltaic power stations occupy at least one [[hectare]] for each megawatt of rated output,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Statistics about some selected markets for utility-scale solar parks|url=http://www.wiki-solar.org/analysis/index.html|publisher=[[Wiki-Solar]]|accessdate=30 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; so require a substantial land area; which is subject to planning approval. The chances of obtaining consent, and the related time, cost and conditions, varying from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and location to location. Many planning approvals will also apply conditions on the treatment of the site after the station has been decommissioned in the future.&lt;ref name=planning /&gt; A professional health, safety and environment assessment is usually undertaken during the design of a PV power station in order to ensure the facility is designed and planned in accordance with all [[Health, Safety and Environment|HSE]] regulations.

=== Grid connection ===

The availability, locality and capacity of the connection to the grid is a major consideration in planning a new solar park, and can be a significant contributor to the cost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Τα "κομμάτια του πάζλ" μιας επένδυσης σε Φ/Β|url=http://www.renelux.com/Greek/odigos.html|work=Greek Photovoltaics Guide|publisher=Renelux|accessdate=30 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most stations are sited within a few kilometres of a suitable grid connection point. This network needs to be capable of absorbing the output of the solar park when operating at its maximum capacity. The project developer will normally have to absorb the cost of providing power lines to this point and making the connection; in addition often to any costs associated with upgrading the grid, so it can accommodate the output from the plant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Connecting your new home, building or development to Ausgrid's electricity network|url=http://www.ausgrid.com.au/Common/Our-network/Network-connections.aspx|publisher=Ausgrid|accessdate=30 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Operation and maintenance ===

Once the solar park has been commissioned, the owner usually enters into a contract with a suitable counterparty to undertake operation and maintenance (O&amp;M).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=McHale|first=Maureen|title=Not All O&amp;M Agreements Are Alike|url=http://www.interpv.net/tech/tech_view.asp?idx=822&amp;part_code=020110051&amp;page=2|publisher=InterPV|accessdate=30 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In many cases this may be fulfilled by the original EPC contractor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Project Overview|url=http://www.firstsolar.com/en/ProjectsOld/Projects-Under-Development/Agua-Caliente-Solar-Project/Overview|work=Agua Caliente Solar Project|publisher=First Solar|accessdate=7 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For other solar farms, thermal imaging is a tool that is used to identify non-performing panels for replacement.&lt;ref name=pv2012&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pv-power-plants.com/fileadmin/user_upload/pdf/PVPP2012_low_02.pdf|title=PV Power Plants 2012|page=35|accessdate=3 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Power delivery ===

A solar park's income derives from the sales of electricity to the grid, and so its output is metered in real-time with readings of its energy output provided, typically on a half-hourly basis, for balancing and settlement within the electricity market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Introduction to the Balancing and Settlement Code|url=http://www.elexon.co.uk/about/what-we-do/introduction-to-the-bsc/|publisher=Elexon|accessdate=30 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Income is affected by the reliability of equipment within the plant and also by the availability of the grid network to which it is exporting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mitavachan|first=H.|display-authors=etal|title=A case study of a 3-MW scale grid-connected solar photovoltaic power plant at Kolar, Karnataka|work=Renewable Energy Systems|publisher=Indian Institute of Science}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some connection contracts allow the [[transmission system operator]] to constrain the output of a solar park, for example at times of low demand or high availability of other generators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Electricity network delivery and access|url=https://www.gov.uk/electricity-network-delivery-and-access|publisher=UK Department of Energy and Climate Change|accessdate=7 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some countries make statutory provision for priority access to the grid&lt;ref name=Priority_access&gt;{{cite web|title=Renewable electricity|url=http://www.erec.org/policy/sectoral-policy/electricity.html|publisher=European Renewable Energy Council|accessdate=31 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; for renewable generators, such as that under the European [[Renewables Directive|Renewable Energy Directive]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Directive 2009/28/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 April 2009 on the promotion of the use of energy from renewable sources and amending and subsequently repealing Directives 2001/77/EC and 2003/30/EC|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32009L0028:EN:NOT|publisher=European Commission|accessdate=7 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Economics and finance ==

In recent years, PV technology has improved its electricity generating [[Solar cell efficiency|efficiency]], reduced the installation [[price per watt|cost per watt]] as well as its [[energy payback time]] (EPBT), and has reached [[grid parity]] in at least 19 different markets by 2014.&lt;ref&gt;

In 2013, utility-scale system prices in highly penetrated markets such as China and Germany were significantly lower ($1.40/W) than in the United States ($3.30/W). The [[International Energy Agency|IEA]] explains these discrepancies due to differences in "soft costs", which include customer acquisition, permitting, inspection and interconnection, installation labor and financing costs.&lt;ref name=IEA-roadmap-PV-2014 /&gt;{{rp|14}}

=== Grid parity ===

{{main|Grid parity}}

Solar generating stations have become progressively cheaper in recent years, and this trend is expected to continue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Aaron|title=Solar panels to keep getting cheaper|url=http://www.evoenergy.co.uk/blog/12483/solar-panels-to-keep-getting-cheaper/|accessdate=13 January 2015|newspaper=Evo Energy|date=23 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Meanwhile, traditional electricity generation is becoming progressively more expensive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Jago|first=Simon|title=Prices going one way|url=http://www.energylivenews.com/2013/03/06/steve-armitage-of-gazprom-energy-talks-bills-and-efficiency/|accessdate=7 March 2013|newspaper=Energy Live News|date=6 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These trends are expected to lead to a crossover point when the levelised cost of energy from solar parks, historically more expensive, matches the cost of traditional electricity generation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Burkart|first=Karl|title=5 breakthroughs that will make solar power cheaper than coal|url=http://www.mnn.com/green-tech/research-innovations/blogs/5-breakthroughs-that-will-make-solar-power-cheaper-than-coal|publisher=Mother Nature Network|accessdate=7 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This point is commonly referred to as grid parity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Spross|first=Jeff|title=Solar Report Stunner: Unsubsidized ‘Grid Parity Has Been Reached In India’, Italy–With More Countries Coming in 2014|url=http://thinkprogress.org/climate/2013/03/03/1664481/solar-report-stunner-unsubsidized-grid-parity-has-been-reached-in-india-italy-with-more-countries-coming-in-2014/?mob|publisher=Climate Progress|accessdate=22 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For merchant solar power stations, where the electricity is being sold into the electricity transmission network, the levelised cost of solar energy will need to match the wholesale electricity price. This point is sometimes called 'wholesale grid parity' or 'busbar parity'.&lt;ref name=UN-Energy-2012&gt;{{cite report |url=http://www.un-energy.org/stories/2498-re-considering-the-economics-of-photovoltaic-power |title=Re-considering the economics of photovoltaic power |author=Morgan Baziliana |display-authors=etal |work=UN-Energy |publisher=United Nations |date=17 May 2012 |accessdate=20 November 2012 |archive-url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20160516014242/http://www.un-energy.org/stories/2498-re-considering-the-economics-of-photovoltaic-power# |archivedate=16 May 2016 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some photovoltaic systems, such as rooftop installations, can supply power directly to an electricity user. In these cases, the installation can be competitive when the output cost matches the price at which the user pays for his electricity consumption. This situation is sometimes called 'retail grid parity', 'socket parity' or 'dynamic grid parity'.&lt;ref name=EPIA&gt;{{cite web|title=Solar Photovoltaics competing in the energy sector – On the road to competitiveness|url=http://www.epia.org/index.php?eID=tx_nawsecuredl&amp;u=0&amp;file=fileadmin/EPIA_docs/publications/epia/Competing_Full_Report.pdf&amp;t=1344960599&amp;hash=b6962eb52b3e5ee0d9c159950995362c|publisher=EPIA|accessdate=30 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research carried out by [[UN-Energy]] in 2012 suggests areas of sunny countries with high electricity prices, such as Italy, Spain and Australia, and areas using diesel generators, have reached retail grid parity.&lt;ref name=UN-Energy-2012/&gt;

=== Incentive mechanisms ===

Because the point of grid parity has not yet been reached in many parts of the world, solar generating stations need some form of financial incentive to compete for the supply of electricity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wolfe|first=Philip|title=Priorities for low carbon transition|url=http://politicsofclimatechange.wordpress.com/priorities-for-low-carbon-transition/philip-wolfe/|work=The politics of Climate Change|publisher=The Policy Network|accessdate=7 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many legislatures around the world have introduced such incentives to support the deployment of solar power stations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Taxes and Incentives for renewable energy|url=http://www.kpmg.com/Global/en/IssuesAndInsights/ArticlesPublications/Documents/taxes-incentives-renewable-energy-2012.pdf|publisher=KPMG|accessdate=7 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Feed-in tariffs ====

{{main|Feed-in tariff}}

Feed-in tariffs are designated prices which must be paid by utility companies for each kilowatt hour of renewable electricity produced by qualifying generators and fed into the grid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Policymaker's Guide to Feed-in Tariff Policy Design|url=http://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy10osti/448|publisher=National Renewable Energy Laboratory|accessdate=22 April 2013}} Couture, T., Cory, K., Kreycik, C., Williams, E., (2010). National Renewable Energy Laboratory, U.S. Dept. of Energy&lt;/ref&gt; These tariffs normally represent a premium on wholesale electricity prices and offer a guaranteed revenue stream to help the power producer finance the project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What are Feed-in Tariffs|url=http://www.fitariffs.co.uk/FITs/|publisher=Feed-in Tariffs Limited|accessdate=7 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Renewable portfolio standards and supplier obligations ====

{{main|Renewable portfolio standard}}

These standards are obligations on utility companies to source a proportion of their electricity from renewable generators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Race to the Top: The Expanding Role of U.S. State Renewable Portfolio Standards|url=http://www.c2es.org/docUploads/RPSReportFin|publisher=University of Michigan|accessdate=22 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In most cases, they do not prescribe which technology should be used and the utility is free to select the most appropriate renewable sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Investment in electricity generation - the role of costs, incentives and risks|url=http://seg.fsu.edu/Library/Investment%20in%20Electricity%20Generation_%20The%20Role%20of%20Costs,%20Incentives,%20and%20Risks.pdf|publisher=UK Energy Research Centre|accessdate=7 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are some exceptions where solar technologies are allocated a proportion of the RPS in what is sometimes referred to as a 'solar set aside'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Solar Carve-Outs in Renewables Portfolio Standards|url=http://www.dsireusa.org/solar/solarpolicyguide/?id=21|publisher=Dsire Solar|accessdate=30 December 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121021172843/http://www.dsireusa.org/solar/solarpolicyguide/?id=21|archivedate=21 October 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Loan guarantees and other capital incentives ====

{{main|Loan guarantee}}

Some countries and states adopt less targeted financial incentives, available for a wide range of infrastructure investment, such as the US Department of Energy loan guarantee scheme,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Innovative Technology Loan Guarantee Program|url=http://www.doe.gov/sites/prod/files/edg/recovery/documents/Innovative__Technology_Loan_Guarantee_Program.pdf|publisher=US DOE Loan Guarantee Program Office (LGPO)|accessdate=21 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; which stimulated a number of investments in the solar power plant in 2010 and 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Independent Review: DOE’s Loan Guarantee Program Has Worked, Can Be Better|url=http://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/does-loan-guarantee-program-has-worked-can-be-better-independent-review|publisher=GreenTech Media|accessdate=7 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Tax credits and other fiscal incentives ====

{{main|Tax credit}}

Another form of indirect incentive which has been used to stimulate investment in solar power plant was tax credits available to investors. In some cases the credits were linked to the energy produced by the installations, such as the Production Tax Credits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Production Tax Credit for Renewable Energy|url=http://www.ucsusa.org/clean_energy/smart-energy-solutions/increase-renewables/production-tax-credit-for.html|publisher=Union of Concerned Scientists|accessdate=30 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other cases the credits were related to the capital investment such as the Investment Tax Credits&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Business Energy Investment Tax Credit (ITC)|url=http://www.doe.gov/savings/business-energy-investment-tax-credit-itc|publisher=US Department of Energy|accessdate=21 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== International, national and regional programmes ====

In addition to free market commercial incentives, some countries and regions have specific programs to support the deployment of solar energy installations.

The [[European Union]]'s [[Renewables Directive]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=Renewables Directive|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2009:140:0016:0062:EN:PDF|title=Directive 2009/28/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council|publisher=European Commission}}&lt;/ref&gt; sets targets for increasing levels of deployment of renewable energy in all member states. Each has been required to develop a [[National Renewable Energy Action Plan]] showing how these targets would be met, and many of these have specific support measures for solar energy deployment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ragwitz|first=Mario|display-authors=etal|title=Assessment of National Renewable Energy Action Plans|url=http://www.repap2020.eu/fileadmin/user_upload/Roadmaps/D115-Assessment_of_NREAPs__REPAP_report_-_final_edition_.pdf|work=REPAP 2020|publisher=Fraunhofer Institut|accessdate=7 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The directive also allows states to develop projects outside their national boundaries, and this may lead to bilateral programs such as the Helios project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Williams|first=Andrew|title=Project Helios: A brighter future for Greece?|url=http://www.solarnovus.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=3790:project-helios-a-brighter-future-for-greece&amp;catid=38:application-tech-features&amp;Itemid=246|accessdate=7 March 2013|newspaper=Solar Novus Today|date=3 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Clean Development Mechanism]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Clean Development Mechanism (CDM)|url=http://unfccc.int/kyoto_protocol/mechanisms/clean_development_mechanism/items/2718.php|publisher=UNFCCC|accessdate=30 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[UNFCCC]] is an international programme under which solar generating stations in certain qualifying countries can be supported.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CDM projects grouped in types|url=http://www.cdmpipeline.org/cdm-projects-type.htm#2|publisher=UNEP Risø Centre|accessdate=7 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally many other countries have specific solar energy development programmes. Some examples are [[India]]'s [[Jawaharlal Nehru National Solar Mission|JNNSM]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ministry of New and Renewable Energy|title=The Jawaharlal Nehru National Solar Mission|url=http://www.mnre.gov.in/solar-mission/jnnsm/introduction-2/|work=Scheme documents|publisher=Government of India|accessdate=30 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Flagship Program in [[Australia]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Department for Resources, Energy and Tourism|title=Solar Flagships Program Open for Business|url=http://minister.ret.gov.au/mediacentre/mediareleases/pages/solarflagshipsprogramopenforbusiness.aspx|accessdate=30 December 2012|newspaper=Government of Australia|date=11 Dec 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and similar projects in [[South Africa]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=South Africa: Renewable Energy Programme to Bring R47 Billion in Investment|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/201210291349.html|accessdate=30 December 2012|newspaper=allAfrica.com|date=29 Oct 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Israel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Solar Energy|url=http://energy.gov.il/English/Subjects/RenewableEnergy/Pages/GxmsMniRenewableEnergySolarEnergy.aspx|publisher=Ministry of Energy and Water Resources|accessdate=30 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Financial performance ===

The financial performance of the solar power plant is a function of its income and its costs.&lt;ref name=Wolfe_book /&gt;

The electrical output of a solar park will be related to the solar radiation, the capacity of the plant and its performance ratio.&lt;ref name=PerfRatio /&gt; The income derived from this electrical output will come primarily from the sale of the electricity,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Investment in Solar Parks|url=http://www.solar-partner.com/en/investment-in-solar-parks.html|publisher=Solar Partner|accessdate=7 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and any incentive payments such as those under Feed-in Tariffs or other support mechanisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Community ownership|url=http://www.westmillsolar.coop/faq.asp|work=FAQs|publisher=Westmill Solar Cooperative|accessdate=7 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Electricity prices may vary at different times of day, giving a higher price at times of high demand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What are time-of-use rates and how do they work?|url=http://www.pge.com/mybusiness/energysavingsrebates/timevaryingpricing/timeofusepricing/|publisher=Pacific Gas and Electric|accessdate=7 March 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140202100847/http://www.pge.com/mybusiness/energysavingsrebates/timevaryingpricing/timeofusepricing/#|archive-date=2 February 2014|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This may influence the design of the plant to increase its output at such times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Optimum Orientation of Solar Panels for Time-of-Use Rates|url=http://www.macslab.com/optsolarpg|publisher=Macs Lab|accessdate=22 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The dominant costs of solar power plants are the capital cost, and therefore any associated financing and depreciation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Optimum Financing Structure|url=http://www.greenrhinoenergy.com/finance/renewable/which_structure.php|publisher=Green Rhino Energy|accessdate=7 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Though operating costs are typically relatively low, especially as no fuel is required,&lt;ref name=low_maintenance /&gt; most operators will want to ensure that adequate operation and maintenance cover&lt;ref name=OandM /&gt; is available to maximise the availability of the plant and thereby optimise the income to cost ratio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Belfiore|first=Francesco|title=Optimizing PV Plant O&amp;M Requires Focus on the Project Lifecycle|url=http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/rea/news/article/2013/01/optimizing-pv-plant-o-m-requires-focus-on-the-project-lifecycle|accessdate=7 March 2013|newspaper=Renewable Energy World}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Geography ==

{{main|Solar power by country|Growth of photovoltaics}}

The first places to reach grid parity were those with high traditional electricity prices and high levels of solar radiation.&lt;ref name=Statistics&gt;{{cite web|title=Statistics about selected locations for utility-scale solar parks|url=http://www.wiki-solar.org/analysis/index.html|publisher=Wiki-Solar|accessdate=5 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, more capacity is being installed in the [[Rooftop photovoltaic power station|rooftop]] than in the utility-scale segment. However, the worldwide distribution of solar parks is expected to change as different regions achieve grid parity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Solar Photovoltaics competing in the energy sector – On the road to competitiveness|url=http://www.epia.org/index.php?eID=tx_nawsecuredl&amp;u=0&amp;file=/uploads/tx_epiapublications/Competing_Full_Report.pdf&amp;t=1365998776&amp;hash=2610e73e375d255b587ac517aa2d9eb9d6789664|publisher=European Photovoltaic Industry Association|accessdate=13 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This transition also includes a shift from rooftop towards utility-scale plants, since the focus of new PV deployment has changed from Europe towards the ''Sunbelt markets'' where ground-mounted PV systems are favored.&lt;ref name=epia-2014 /&gt;{{rp|43}}

Because of the economic background, large-scale systems are presently distributed where the support regimes have been the most consistent, or the most advantageous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Renewable Power, Policy, and the Cost of  Capital |url=http://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/handle/2027.42/50488/070419%20RPPCC%20FIN |publisher=UNEP/BASE Sustainable Energy Finance Initiative |accessdate=22 April 2013}} Retrieved 13 April 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Total capacity of worldwide PV plants above 4 MW&lt;sub&gt;AC&lt;/sub&gt; was assessed by [[Wiki-Solar]] as 36 GW in c. 2,300 installations at the end of 2014&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Utility-scale solar breaks all records in 2014 to reach 36 GW|url=http://wiki-solar.org/library/public/150305_Utility-solar_2014_figures_set%20multiple_records.pdf|website=wiki-solar.org|publisher=Wiki-Solar|ref=WS2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and represents about 25 percent of total global PV capacity of 139&amp;nbsp;GW.&lt;ref name=epia-2014&gt;

=== China ===

{{main|Solar power in China}}

China was reported in early 2013 to have overtaken Germany as the nation with the most utility-scale solar capacity.&lt;ref name=Capacity_2013&gt;{{cite news|last=Hill|first=Joshua|title=Giant Solar Farm Capacity Doubling Inside 12 Months Breaking 12 GW|url=http://cleantechnica.com/2013/02/22/giant-solar-farms-capacity-doubling-inside-12-months-breaking-12-gw/|accessdate=7 March 2013|newspaper=Clean Technica|date=22 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much of this has been supported by the [[Clean Development Mechanism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Project search|url=http://cdm.unfccc.int/Projects/projsearch.html|work=CDM: Project activities|publisher=UNFCCC|accessdate=7 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Germany ===

{{main|Solar power in Germany}}

The first multi-megawatt plant in Europe was the 4.2 MW community-owned project at Hemau, commissioned in 2003.&lt;ref name=Hemau&gt;{{cite web|title=In Hemau liefert der weltweit größte Solarpark umweltfreundlichen Strom aus der Sonne|url=http://www.hemau.de/index.asp?NAVIID=%7B21B64141-C02C-4194-8A02-7D54CA2AB16F%7D|publisher=Stadt Hemau|language     =German|accessdate=13 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; But it was the revisions to the German feed-in tariffs in 2004,&lt;ref name=EEG2004 /&gt; which gave the strongest impetus to the establishment of utility-scale solar power plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Best of Both Worlds: What if German installation costs were combined with the best solar resources?|url=https://financere.nrel.gov/finance/content/germany-solar-feed-in-tariff-FIT-insolation-resource-comp|publisher=National Renewable Energy Laboratory|accessdate=22 April 2013}} Retrieved 13 April 2013&lt;/ref&gt; The first to be completed under this programme was the Leipziger Land solar park developed by Geosol.&lt;ref name=Leipziger_Land&gt;{{cite web|title=Leipziger Land project|url=http://www.geosol.de/sites/default/files/references/GERMANY%20REFERENCE%20Leipziger%20Land%20-%20EN.pdf|publisher=Geosol|accessdate=13 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several dozen plants were built between 2004 and 2011, several of which were at the time the [[#Noteworthy solar parks|largest in the world]]. The [[German Renewable Energy Act|EEG]], the law which establishes Germany’s feed-in tariffs, provides the legislative basis not just for the compensation levels, but other regulatory factors, such as priority access to the grid.&lt;ref name=Priority_access /&gt; The law was amended in 2010 to restrict the use of agricultural land,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Olson|first=Syanne|title=IBC Solar completes grid connection for 13.8MW German solar park|url=http://www.pv-tech.org/news/ibc_solar_completes_grid_connection_for_13.8mw_german_solar_park|accessdate=7 March 2013|newspaper=PV-Tech|date=14 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  since which time most solar parks have been built on so-called ‘development land’, such as former military sites.&lt;ref name=Neuhardenberg /&gt;  Partly for this reason, the geographic distribution of photovoltaic power plants in Germany&lt;ref name=Wiki-Germany /&gt; is biased towards the former Eastern Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Eastern Germany's sunny future |work=Michael Dumiak |url=http://archive.fortune.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/2007/05/28/100049624/index.htm |publisher=Fortune magazine |date=22 May 2007|accessdate=15 January 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=German PV Funding Up In The Air Again|url=http://www.solarbuzz.com/resources/analyst-insights/german-pv-funding-air|publisher=SolarBuzz|accessdate=22 April 2013}} Retrieved 13 April 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

=== India ===

{{main|Solar power in India}}

India has been rising up the leading nations for the installation of utility-scale solar capacity. The [[Charanka Solar Park]] in [[Gujarat]] was opened officially in April 2012&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Gujarat Solar Park Inauguration at Charanka, Gujarat|url=http://www.indiansolarsummit.com/gujarat-solar-park-inauguration-at-charanka-gujarat/|accessdate=7 March 2013|newspaper=Indian Solar Summit|date=19 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and was at the time the [[#Noteworthy solar parks|largest group of solar power plants]] in the world.

Geographically the states with the largest installed capacity are [[Telangana]], [[Rajasthan]] and [[Andhra Pradesh]] with over 2 [[Gigawatt|GW]] of installed solar power capacity each&lt;ref name=capa&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mnre.gov.in/file-manager/UserFiles/grid-connected-solar-power-project-installed-capacity.pdf|title=State wise installed solar power capacity |publisher=Ministry of New and Renewable Energy, Govt. of India |date= 31 October 2017 |accessdate=24 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Rajasthan and Gujarat share the [[Thar Desert]], along with Pakistan. In September 2018 Acme Solar announced that it had commissioned India's cheapest solar power plant, the 200 [[megawatt|MW]] Rajasthan Bhadla solar power park

=== Spain ===

{{main|Solar power in Spain}}

The majority of the deployment of solar power stations in Spain to date occurred during the boom market of 2007-8.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Solar Industry Learns Lessons in Spanish Sun|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/09/business/energy-environment/09solar.html?_r=0|accessdate=7 March 2013|newspaper=New York Times|date=8 March 2010|first=Elisabeth|last=Rosenthal}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The stations are well distributed around the country, with some concentration in [[Extremadura]], [[Castile-La Mancha]] and [[Murcia]].&lt;ref name=Spain_map /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2210">'''Piezomagnetism''' is a phenomenon observed in some [[antiferromagnetic]] crystals. It is characterised by a [[linear]] coupling between the system's magnetic polarisation and [[Strain (materials science)|mechanical strain]]. In a piezomagnetic, one may induce a spontaneous [[magnetic moment]] by applying physical stress, or a physical deformation by applying a [[magnetic field]].

Piezomagnetism differs from the related property of [[magnetostriction]]; if an applied magnetic field is reversed in direction, the strain produced changes signs. Additionally, a non-zero piezomagnetic moment can be produced by mechanical strain ''alone'', at zero field - this is not true of magnetostriction.&lt;ref&gt;B. D. Cullity (1971), Fundamentals of magnetostriction. ''Journal of Metals'' '''1''', 323.&lt;/ref&gt; According to IEEE: "Piezomagnetism is the linear magnetomechanical effect analogous to the linear electromechanical effect of [[piezoelectricity]]. Similarly, magnetostriction and electrostriction are analogous second-order effects. These higher-order effects can be represented as effectively first-order when variations in the system parameters are small compared with the initial values of the parameters".&lt;ref&gt;IEEE Std 319-1990 (1991), IEEE Standard on Magnetostrictive Materials: Piezomagnetic Nomenclature.&lt;/ref&gt;

The piezomagnetic effect is made possible by an absence of certain symmetry elements in a crystal structure; specifically, symmetry under time reversal forbids the property.&lt;ref&gt;I. E. Dzialoshinskii (1958), The problem of piezomagnetism. ''Soviet Phys. JETP'' '''6''', 621.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first experimental observation of piezomagnetism was made in 1960, in the fluorides of cobalt and manganese.&lt;ref&gt;A.S. Borovik-Romanov (1960), Piezomagnetism in the antiferromagnetic fluorides of cobalt and manganese. ''Soviet Phys. JETP'' '''11''', 786.&lt;/ref&gt;

The strongest piezomagnet known is uranium dioxide, with magnetoelastic memory switching at magnetic fields near 180,000 Oe.&lt;ref&gt;M. Jaime et al. (2017), Piezomagnetism and magnetoelastic memory in uranium dioxide. ''Nature Communications'' '''8''', 99.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Puna Geothermal Venture''' (PGV) is a currently nonoperational [[geothermal energy]] power plant on the [[Hawaii (island)|island of Hawaii]], the largest island in the state of [[Hawaii]]. The plant was shut down shortly after the start of the May [[2018 lower Puna eruption]]. The eruption caused lava to flow over a power substation, a warehouse and at least three geothermal wells that had been preventatively quenched and capped when [[lava fountain|lava fountain]]s erupted nearby, eventually also cutting off road access.&lt;ref name="staradvertiser.com"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.staradvertiser.com/2018/05/27/breaking-news/lava-speeds-up-takes-aim-at-puna-geothermal-wells/|title=Lava speeds up, forcing evacuations and covering well at Puna Geothermal plant|date=May 27, 2018 |newspaper=[[Star Advertiser]] |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.staradvertiser.com/2018/07/08/hawaii-news/geothermal-plant-faces-challenges-amid-uncertainty/|title=Puna Geothermal Venture faces challenges amid uncertainty|date=July 8, 2018 |newspaper=[[Star Advertiser]] |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

PGV was the first and only commercially-productive geothermal electrical plant in Hawaii. Constructed on a site adjacent to failed experimental wells drilled and operated by the Hawaii Geothermal Project in the 1970s and 80s, construction on the generating facility began in 1989 and was completed in 1993.  

Prior to the shutdown and lava damage, the plant had an installed generating capacity of 38&amp;nbsp;MW&lt;ref name = "HELCO"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hawaiielectriclight.com/clean-energy-hawaii/clean-energy-facts/renewable-energy-and-storage-projects|title=Renewable Energy &amp; Storage Projects|website=www.hawaiianelectric.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; from six production wells and five injection wells along [[Kīlauea]]’s East [[rift zone]], which had provided approximately 25% of the island’s power. Power generated was sold to the [[HELCO|Hawaiian Electric Industries]] (also known as HELCO) to supply the island’s electric power customers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hawaiianelectric.com/clean-energy-hawaii/clean-energy-facts/renewable-energy-sources/geothermal/puna-geothermal-venture-(pgv)|title=Puna Geothermal Venture (PGV)|website=www.hawaiianelectric.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Early geothermal exploration and development===
The first exploratory geothermal wells in Kapoho were drilled in 1961–62.&lt;ref name="Ormat 2016 PowerPoint"/&gt;{{rp|9}} The effort was spearheaded by wealthy local landowner [[Rufus Anderson Lyman#Children|Richard Lyman]] following a trip to Japan, where he learned of a project to lay underwater power cables between the country's islands. Upon returning to Hawaii, Lyman promoted geothermal electrical generation in the Puna district, distributed to Oahu and other population centers by underwater electric cables, as a way of developing the then-newly-admitted-state's economy. He found business partners to establish Hawaii Magma Power in 1961 to develop geothermal energy in the region. Several exploratory drills were made before the company determined that there was insufficient geothermal potential, although Lyman claimed to the ''Honolulu Advertiser'' that the company "had mechanical difficulties and gave up."&lt;ref name="Szvetecz thesis"&gt;{{cite thesis|last1=Szvetecz |first1=Annie |type=MSc thesis |title=Geothermal energy in Hawai'i: an analysis of promotion and regulation |date=August 2001 |publisher=ProQuest LLC |url=https://scholarworks.umt.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=https://www.google.com/&amp;httpsredir=1&amp;article=9293&amp;context=etd |accessdate=May 30, 2018 |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|12–13}}

===Hawaii Geothermal Project===
In the 1970s, the Hawaii Geothermal Project was formed to conduct research funded by federal and state grants.&lt;ref name="Szvetecz thesis"/&gt;{{rp|13–15}} After scientific studies of the geology and geothermal potential of the area were conducted by HGP, a site for the first well was chosen in 1975. Drilling began without environmental impact studies or a period for public input. At the time, the area around the drill site was very rural and undisturbed, but new subdivisions were planned nearby.&lt;ref name="Szvetecz thesis"/&gt;{{rp|14–15}} The well was occasionally allowed to discharge gas and fluid from the borehole, which created a loud noise and release large volumes of toxins and pollutants into the air. By 1976, three subdivisions nearby had been established and were beginning to see an influx of residents, including twelve families that now lived within one mile of the well. The continued noise pollution and toxic gas discharges began to cause concern and opposition from the new, nearby residents. Nonetheless, funds were secured from the federal and state governments to begin the next step of the project: turning the geothermal energy of the well into electricity.&lt;ref name="Szvetecz thesis"/&gt;{{rp|15–19}} Although HELCO was among the stakeholders in the project, they assured their stockholders that they would not invest the company's capital in the project due to the volcanic and seismic risk at the site.&lt;ref name="Szvetecz thesis"/&gt;{{rp|19}}

An experimental 3&amp;nbsp;MW generator was completed in 1981 and remained operational throughout the 1980s. However, families continued to build and move into the nearby subdivisions, resulting in several attempts and a failed lawsuit to stop the noise and pollution generated from the site.&lt;ref name="Szvetecz thesis"/&gt;{{rp|20–29}} Since the site was within a high lava hazard zone, the generator was built on skids and housed in a building which included a crane so that the generator could be removed if lava flows threatened the facility.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name="Boyd et al 2002"/&gt;{{rp|13}} --&gt; Additionally, the wellhead was housed in a concrete bunker that could be sealed to prevent lava from damaging the wellhead.&lt;ref name="Boyd et al 2002"/&gt;{{rp|13}} Despite the opposition and the operating losses incurred by operating and maintaining the generator, there was enough support to keep the generator operating. In April 1989, county officials raised concerns about the condition of the facility following a minor blowout and considered reviewing and possibly revoking the operating permit for the site. After several additional incidents at the site in 1989, the facility was ordered to be shut down, which occurred on December 11.&lt;ref name="Szvetecz thesis"/&gt;{{rp|30–32}} During its life, the HGP generator produced between 15 and 19&amp;nbsp;million [[kilowatt hour]]s of electricity annually.&lt;ref name="Boyd et al 2002"/&gt;{{rp|13}}

In 1980, HELCO requested a proposal for 25&amp;nbsp;MW of geothermal electricity generation. To answer the request, a joint venture was formed the same year between two of Lyman's companies and two other companies to produce geothermal energy on a {{convert|500|acre|adj=on}} parcel of land leased from the Lyman family. The joint venture was renamed Puna Geothermal Venture in 1981. Over the following years, PGV drilled three wells, but all suffered from mechanical failures of their well casings and were unusable for production.&lt;ref name="Szvetecz thesis"/&gt;{{rp|39–41}}

In 1986, PGV secured a contract with HELCO to supply 25&amp;nbsp;MW of electricity by 1993. PGV promised that they would be using new technology that would result in zero emissions and operate at a drastically lower noise level. In 1989, when the HGP facility was facing growing problems, the PGV proposed facility managed to overcome enough local opposition to be granted a permit from the local planning commission.&lt;ref name="Szvetecz thesis"/&gt;{{rp|41–45}}

The plant has raised some concerns with local residents as a result of occasional toxic emissions.&lt;ref name="GTM March 2015"/&gt; In 1991, well KS-8 suffered a [[blowout (well drilling)|blowout]], causing the state to suspend the permits for the plant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.environment-hawaii.org/?p=3857|title=At Puna Geothermal Venture, Success Is Always Just Around the Corner|website=www.environment-hawaii.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Essoyan |first1=Susan |title=Blowout Shuts Geothermal Unit in Hawaii |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1991-06-15/news/mn-503_1_puna-geothermal-venture |accessdate=June 9, 2018 |work=Los Angeles Times |date=June 15, 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016 the plant’s owners were found to be in violation of U.S. [[Environmental Protection Agency]] standards regarding [[hydrogen sulfide]] releases and was fined $76,500 for two incidents in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.khon2.com/news/local-news/epa-finds-puna-geothermal-venture-violated-chemical-safety-rules/1025938733|title=EPA finds Puna Geothermal Venture violated chemical safety rules|first=Web|last=Staff|date=January 12, 2016|publisher=[[Nexstar Media Group]] |work=[[KHON2]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |last1=Higuchi |first1=Dean |title=EPA finds Puna Geothermal Venture violated chemical safety rules |url=https://archive.epa.gov/epa/newsreleases/epa-finds-puna-geothermal-venture-violated-chemical-safety-rules.html |accessdate=May 30, 2018 |publisher=EPA |date=January 12, 2016 |location=Honolulu}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additional concerns and opposition to the plant have been raised by Native Hawaiians, who view all forms of volcanic activity as manifestations of the goddess [[Pele (deity)|Pele]]. To the Native Hawaiians who revere Pele, geothermal wells and energy production are a desecration of her body and spirit.&lt;ref name="Ormat 2016 PowerPoint"/&gt;{{rp|7}}

In 2005 during the drilling of the KS-13 well, magma was encountered at a depth of {{convert|2488|m|order=flip|abbr=on}}. The borehole had to be redrilled several times as the magma flowed up the borehole, cooling into clear, colorless glass. The magma, at a temperature of approximately 1922°F (1050°C), was [[dacitic]]—similar to the [[granitic]] rock that forms continents—consisting of approximately two-thirds [[silica]], which contrasts with the dark, iron-rich [[basalt|basaltic]] rock that forms most of the Hawaiian Islands. It was encountered after drilling through a {{convert|73|m|order=flip|abbr=on}} layer of [[diorite]] igneous rock, which suggested to researchers that the magma had chemically separated as it dwelled for a long period of time.&lt;ref name="Nature 2008"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Dalton |first1=Rex |title=Drillers hit Hawaiian magma |url=https://www.nature.com/news/2008/081217/full/news.2008.1317.html |accessdate=June 2, 2018 |work=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |date=December 17, 2008 |doi=10.1038/news.2008.1317}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AGU Abstract"&gt;{{cite web |title=Abstract: Dacite Melt at the Puna Geothermal Venture Wellfield, Big Island of Hawaii |url=http://abstractsearch.agu.org/meetings/2008/FM/V23A-2129.html |website=American Geophysical Union |accessdate=June 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Abstract:Dacite Melt at the Puna Geothermal Venture Wellfield, Big Island of Hawaii |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/253714192_Dacite_Melt_at_the_Puna_Geothermal_Venture_Wellfield_Big_Island_of_Hawaii |website=ResearchGate |accessdate=June 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC 2008"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Amos |first1=Jonathan |title=Drillers break into magma chamber |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/7780873.stm |accessdate=June 2, 2018 |work=[[BBC News]] |date=December 17, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; As quoted in the journal ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'', the team said it was possibly the first time that "the actual process of differentiation of continental-type rock from primitive ocean basalt has been observed ''in situ''".&lt;ref name="Nature 2008"/&gt; Magma specialist Bruce Marsh of [[Johns Hopkins University]] described the uniqueness of the encounter: "Before, all we had to deal with were lava flows; but they are the end of a magma's life.

It's the difference between looking at dinosaur bones in a museum and seeing a real, living dinosaur roaming out in the field."&lt;ref name="BBC 2008"/&gt;

PGV had a generating capacity of 25&amp;nbsp;MW when it opened in 1993, which was expanded to 30&amp;nbsp;MW in 1995 and 38&amp;nbsp;MW in 2012.&lt;ref name="Ormat 2016 PowerPoint"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Schroeder |first1=Martin |title=A Renewable Energy Solution on Hawaii Island – The Puna Geothermal Plant |url=https://www.esmap.org/sites/esmap.org/files/Ormat_World%20Bank%20RE%20Study%20Tour_web.pdf |publisher=Ormat Technologies |accessdate=May 30, 2018 |format=PDF |date=May 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|9}} In 2015, HELCO announced that Ormat was selected as the winner of a bid to add 25&amp;nbsp;MW of geothermal generating capacity in the Puna district.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Cocke |first1=Sophie |title=Ormat Awarded Big Island Geothermal Contract |url=http://www.civilbeat.org/2015/02/ormat-awarded-big-island-geothermal-contract/ |publisher=Honolulu City Beat |accessdate=May 30, 2018 |date=February 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GTM March 2015"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Hunt |first1=Tam |title=Is Going Bigger on Geothermal a Good Move for the Big Island? |url=https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/is-going-bigger-on-geothermal-a-good-move-for-the-big-island#gs.R7mVDxc |publisher=Greentech Media |accessdate=May 30, 2018 |date=March 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ormat 2016 PowerPoint"/&gt;{{rp|25}} In March 2018, Ormat announced their plan to increase production at the plant by 8&amp;nbsp;MW—from 38&amp;nbsp;MW to 46&amp;nbsp;MW—by 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Kim |first1=Alice |title=Puna Geothermal Venture Increasing Production |url=https://www.higp.hawaii.edu/hggrc/puna-geothermal-venture-increasing-production/ |publisher=Hawai'i Groundwater &amp; Geothermal Resources Center |accessdate=May 30, 2018 |date=March 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 3, 2018 earth fissures opened inside and around the [[Leilani Estates]] subdivision near the PGV plant, following hundreds of earthquakes over the first two days of May, resulting in concerns of possible toxic hydrogen sulfide gas releases and explosions at the geothermal power facility. According to PGV's vice president of community affairs, PGV began preemptively shutting down equipment and inventorying its stockpile of highly-flammable [[pentane]] when the frequency of earthquakes began increasing and the first cracks appeared in Leilani Estates on May 1–2;&lt;!-- semicolon used because both sentences (either side of semi-colon) are according to PGV's vice president of community affairs and share same citation --&gt; the plant was taken off-line approximately three hours after it received the first report that lava had begun to emerge from the ground on May 3.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=VIDEO: Puna Geothermal Concerns At Eruption Meeting|url=http://www.bigislandvideonews.com/2018/05/05/video-puna-geothermal-concerns-at-eruption-meeting/|publisher=Big Island Video News|accessdate=May 30, 2018|date=May 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; All pentane stored at PGV, approximately {{convert|60000|USgal}}, were removed by the morning of May 10.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Crews remove pentane gas from Puna geothermal plant amid safety concerns|url=http://www.hawaiinewsnow.com/story/38140123/precautionary-measures-taken-at-puna-geothermal-plant-amid-growing-lava-fears|accessdate=May 30, 2018|work=Hawaii News Now|date=May 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Over the next couple of weeks, the wells were quenched with cold water to stabilize them—where the weight of the cold water was sufficient to prevent steam from rising from the bottom of the well—and allow them to be plugged. One well, KS-14, possibly being super-heated from close proximity to magma, could not be quenched and was filled with a [[Drilling fluid|drilling mud]] in an attempt to stabilize it.

{{quote|To Exopoltics.org’s credit, it is true that fracking (if it were occurring, which it is not) could cause earthquakes. Unfortunately for their argument, another thing that causes earthquakes is volcanic activity — the very same activity that Exopolitics is trying to blame on PGV. You can’t use the symptom of a lava flow (earthquakes) as evidence that earthquakes (from fracking) caused that lava flow. That’s not how this works. Are there earthquakes in the area of PGV? Certainly. There are earthquakes all over the volcanically active Big Island. Is it shocking that there would be earthquakes focused in the (extremely general) region of PGV? Not at all — recall that PGV’s location was selected due to its ''proximity'' to a major fault system, thereby allowing water to flow through the ground and come in contact with the volcanically heated region below. You cannot use PGV’s location (intentionally placed in an area where earthquakes are common and lava flows likely) as evidence that it caused earthquakes and lava flows. That’s not how this works.&lt;ref name="Snopes fracking"/&gt;}}

The first and only geothermal energy plant in Hawaii, the plant began generating power in 1993, and is owned by [[Ormat Technologies]] which purchased it in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.higp.hawaii.edu/hggrc/projects/geothermal-digital-collection/geothermal-topic-guides/puna-geothermal-venture/|title=Puna Geothermal Venture - Hawai‘i Groundwater &amp; Geothermal Resources Center|website=www.higp.hawaii.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Power plants===
There are two power plants in the Puna Complex. The first plant consists of ten [[Combined cycle]] [[Ormat Technologies#Thermal Energy |Ormat Energy Converters]] (OEC) made up of ten [[steam turbine]]s and ten [[Binary cycle|binary turbines]].&lt;ref name=ar2017/&gt; Production of electricity began on April 22, 1993.&lt;ref name="EERE pamphlet"&gt;{{cite web |title=Geothermal Technologies Program: Tapping the Earth’s energy to meet our heat and power needs |url=https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy04osti/36025.pdf |publisher=U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy |accessdate=June 2, 2018 |format=PDF |date=April 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second plant consists of two [[Binary cycle]] OECs and was placed in service in 2011 and commenced commercial operation in 2012.

As of 2008, there are five active production wells all of which have a surface elevation of {{convert|620|ft|abbr=on}} above sea level and produce a mixture of steam and brine. The five wells produced an average of 600,000&amp;nbsp;lb/hour (270,000&amp;nbsp;kg/hour) of steam and 1,200,000&amp;nbsp;lb/hour (545,000&amp;nbsp;kg/hour) of brine. The temperature of fluids emerging from the production wells is approximately 640°F (338°C), which is returned to the injection wells at approximately 300–400°F (150–200°C) after being used to generate electricity.&lt;ref name="Fitch and Matlick 2008"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Fitch |first1=David |last2=Matlick |first2=Skip |title=Gold, silver and Other Metals in scale—  Puna Geothermal Venture, Hawaii |journal=GRC  Transactions |date=2008 |volume=32 |pages=385–388 |url=http://pubs.geothermal-library.org/lib/grc/1028353.pdf |accessdate=June 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Direct uses"/&gt;

===Alternative uses of geothermally-heated fluids===
In addition to electricity generation, additional uses of the facility have been suggested. A paper presented by Andrea Gill of the Hawaii Deptartment of Business, Economic Development, and Tourism—on behalf of a working group established to consider direct uses of the geothermal energy at PGV and its vicinity—outlined potential direct uses of the fluids at PGV as well as shallow groundwater wells in its vicinity, including fruit and [[macadamia nut]] dehydration, [[aquaculture]] and [[greenhouse]] heating, [[pasteurization]] and [[Sterilization (microbiology)|sterilization]], [[Hot spring|geothermal/health spas]], and [[geothermal heat pump]]s.&lt;ref name="Direct uses"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Gill |first1=Andrea T. |title=Prospective Direct Use Enterprises in Kapoho, Hawaii |url=https://energy.hawaii.gov/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Prospective-Direct-Use-Enterprises-in-Kapoho-Hawaii.pdf |publisher=Hawaii Dept. of Business, Economic Development and Tourism, Strategic Industries Division |accessdate=June 2, 2018 |format=PDF |date=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; At PGV, hot brine after being utilized to generate electricity is approximately 300–400°F (150–200°C) when it is reinjected into the earth; the brine could be tapped for its thermal energy before being reinjected. Water wells under 750&amp;nbsp;ft (230&amp;nbsp;m) in the vicinity of PGV have recorded temperatures up to 193°F (89°C).&lt;ref name="Direct uses"/&gt;

In 2005, after a drill hit an uncommonly-observed type of magma, researchers and PGV expressed a desire to turn the borehole into an observatory for scientific studies.&lt;ref name="Nature 2008"/&gt;

The '''''Rena'' oil spill''' occurred off the coast of [[Tauranga]] in [[New Zealand]]. The spill was caused by the [[ship grounding|grounding]] of {{MV|Rena}} on the [[Astrolabe Reef]]. The ''Rena'' was a [[container ship]] and cargo vessel owned by the Greek shipping company [[Costamare|Costamare Inc.]], through one of its subsidiary companies, and chartered by the [[Mediterranean Shipping Company]] (MSC). The spill has been described as New Zealand's worst maritime environmental disaster.&lt;ref name=stuff3&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10758195 |title='Worst maritime environmental disaster' |work=New Zealand Herald |date=2011-10-11 |accessdate=2011-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On Wednesday, 5 October 2011, at 2:20 AM (Tuesday, 4 October 13:20&amp;nbsp;UTC) while sailing in clear weather from [[Napier, New Zealand|Napier]] to [[Tauranga]], at a speed of {{convert|17|kn}}, ''Rena'' [[ship grounding|ran aground]] on the Astrolabe Reef.&lt;ref name="MNZ"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.maritimenz.govt.nz/news/media-releases-2011/20111005c.asp |title=Tauranga incident response update |publisher=Maritime New Zealand |date=2011-10-05 |accessdate=2011-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://costamare.irwebpage.com/pr100711.html |title=M/V Rena Information |publisher=Costamare Inc |date=7 October 2011 |accessdate=2011-10-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120720010921/http://costamare.irwebpage.com/pr100711.html |archivedate=20 July 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ship was carrying 1,368 containers, eight of which contained hazardous materials, as well as 1,700 tonnes of heavy fuel oil and 200 tonnes of [[marine diesel oil]].&lt;ref name=stuff2&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/environment/5763630/Rena-worst-maritime-environmental-disaster |title=Rena 'worst maritime environmental disaster' |work=Stuff |date=11 October 2011 |accessdate=12 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially the ship [[List (watercraft)|listed]] 11 degrees to port, with the front stuck on the reef.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sail-world.com/Cruising/international/Maritime-NZ-Update:-Tue-11-Oct---Rena-rotates-through-25-degrees/89504 |title=Maritime NZ Update: Tue 11 Oct - Rena rotates through 25 degrees |work=Sail World |accessdate=13 October 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019175714/http://www.sail-world.com/Cruising/international/Maritime-NZ-Update:-Tue-11-Oct---Rena-rotates-through-25-degrees/89504 |archivedate=19 October 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By Sunday, 9 October 2011, a {{convert|5|km|mi}} oil slick threatened wildlife and the area's rich fishing waters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-pacific-15230941 |title=New Zealand oil ship leak 'raises questions |work=BBC News |date=2011-10-09 |accessdate=2011-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Oil from ''Rena'' began washing ashore at [[Mount Maunganui]] beach on 10 October 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10757900 |title='Highly toxic' water at Mt Maunganui |work=New Zealand Herald |date=10 October 2011 |accessdate=11 October 2011 |first1=Newstalk |last1=Zb}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Bad weather that night had caused the ship to shift further onto the reef, and the crew was evacuated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.stuff.co.nz/environment/5763630/Stricken-ship-crew-ashore-after-mayday-call |title=Stricken ship crew ashore after mayday call |work=Stuff |date=11 October 2011 |accessdate=11 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nzh1&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10758195 |title=Rena crew 'terrified' by tipping |work=New Zealand Herald |date=11 October 2011 |accessdate=11 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The shifting of the ship caused further damage, resulting in a further 130 - 350 tonnes of oil leaking.&lt;ref name=nzh1/&gt;

Strong winds and bad weather on the night of 11 October 2011 caused the ship to list over to starboard 19 degrees; this resulted in between 30 and 70 containers being washed overboard.&lt;ref name=stuff1&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/environment/5770592/Containers-fall-from-grounded-ship-Rena |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130112065032/http://www.stuff.co.nz/environment/5770592/Containers-fall-from-grounded-ship-Rena |dead-url=yes |archive-date=12 January 2013 |title=Rena captain in court, containers overboard |work=Stuff |date=12 October 2011 |accessdate=12 October 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  None of the containers contained hazardous cargo.&lt;ref name=stuff1 /&gt;  Containers subsequently began washing ashore on [[Motiti Island]].&lt;ref name=stuff1 /&gt;

On the afternoon of 12 October 2011, aerial footage showed a large crack in the hull, increasing fears that the ship could break in two and sink.&lt;ref name=tvnz1&gt;{{cite web |url= http://tvnz.co.nz/national-news/massive-crack-rena-4460592 |title=Massive crack on Rena |publisher=TVNZ |date=12 October 2011 |accessdate=12 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also showed a container floating in the water surrounded by smoke, suggesting that a chemical reaction was occurring.&lt;ref name=tvnz1 /&gt;

On 13 October 2011, [[Maritime New Zealand]] ordered beaches from Mount Maunganui to Maketu Point, including the [[Maketu|Maketu Estuary]], to be closed to the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/AK1110/S00337/public-notice-beach-access-restricted.htm |title=Public notice – beach access restricted |publisher=Maritime New Zealand |date=13 October 2011 |accessdate=13 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Volunteers were warned that contact with spilled oil could lead to vomiting, nausea and rashes, and local residents were urged to close their windows to limit fumes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.stuff.co.nz/environment/rena-crisis/5776794/Cleanup-crew-warned-of-health-risks |title=Cleanup crew warned of health risks |work=Dominion-Post |author=Shane Cowlishaw |date=13 October 2011 |accessdate=13 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Costamare Shipping, the owners of ''Rena'', apologised to the people of Tauranga, saying they were "deeply sorry" for the "disastrous event."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.stuff.co.nz/environment/rena-crisis/5776790/Deeply-sorry-for-your-situation-Renas-owner |title='Deeply sorry for your situation' - Rena's owner  |publisher=Fairfax NZ |date=13 October 2011|accessdate=13 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although not legally obligated to do so, the charterer, Mediterranean Shipping Company, promised to help with the cleanup costs.&lt;ref name="mschelps"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.3news.co.nz/MSC-will-help-foot-Rena-cleanup-bill--Joyce/tabid/419/articleID/229770/Default.aspx |title=MSC will help foot Rena cleanup bill |publisher=3 News |date=17 October 2011 | accessdate=22 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 14 October 2011, it was reported that the ship's hull had cracked in half, and the bow and stern sections were held together only by internal structures and the reef.&lt;ref name=stuff4&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/environment/rena-crisis/5783705/Rena-salvage-Preparations-to-pump-oil |title=Rena salvage: Preparations to pump oil  |work=Stuff |date=2011-10-14 |accessdate=2011-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Calmer weather meant that preparations could be made to pump out the remainder of the ship's oil,&lt;ref name=stuff4/&gt; but a change in the wind direction meant that oil was likely to spread as far east as [[Whakatane]] and [[Opotiki]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tvnz.co.nz/national-news/oil-could-make-whakatane-shore-4464049 |title=Oil could make it to Whakatane shore |publisher=TVNZ |date=2011-10-14 |accessdate=2011-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also on 14 October 2011, the [[Filipino people|Filipino]] crew of the ''Rena'' left New Zealand "for their safety" after a racist backlash against Filipinos in Tauranga.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10758929 |title=Rena crew quit NZ for their 'safety' |publisher=New Zealand Herald  |date=2011-10-14 |accessdate=2011-10-14 |first=Lincoln |last=Tan}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/environment/rena-crisis/5785635/Filipinos-fear-Rena-backlash |title=Filipinos fear Rena backlash |work=Stuff |date=2011-10-14 |accessdate=2011-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Calm weather on 15 October 2011, allowed salvage experts to board the vessel and begin preparations to pump the remaining oil to a barge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/environment/rena-crisis/5789174/Groaning-creaking-Rena-unsafe-for-oil-pumping |title='Groaning, creaking' Rena unsafe for oil pumping |work=Stuff |date=2011-10-15 |accessdate=2011-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Platforms were attached to the side of the ship, and pumping began on 16 October 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/environment/rena-crisis/5792006/Rena-salvage-crews-start-pumping |title=Rena salvage crews start pumping |work=Stuff |date=2011-10-16 |accessdate=2011-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By 17 October only twenty tons of oil had been removed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10759676 |title=Rena: race to pump oil from 'dying ship' |work=New Zealand Herald |date=2011-10-17 |accessdate=2011-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 16 October a mine-countermeasures team aboard [[HMNZS Manawanui (A09)|HMNZS ''Manawanui'']] began hunting for spilled containers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tvnz.co.nz/national-news/navy-uses-sonar-locate-containers-4467283 |title=Navy uses sonar to locate containers |publisher=TVNZ |date=2011-10-17 |accessdate=2011-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After October, salvage efforts were focused on removing the ship's cargo before it completely broke apart.

In January 2012, the ''Rena'' completely broke in half and the stern section slipped off of the reef and eventually sank.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2012/jan/11/newzealand-asia-pacific |title=Cargo ship Rena breaks up on New Zealand reef - in pictures |date=11 January 2012 |accessdate=13 January 2012 |location=London |work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; A small amount of oil and containers escaped the ship as it broke in half.

By 23 March 2012, 649 containers of cargo had been recovered and it was thought that only a few tens of tonnes of oil still remained in the ship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Fresh oil spills from Rena|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10794156|work=New Zealand Herald|accessdate=28 March 2012|date=23 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Media coverage and public reactions==
The incident was not immediately brought to the public eye since it took place on 5 October 2011, the same day the well-known American businessman [[Steve Jobs]] died.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cheng|first=Jacqui|title=Steve Jobs: February 24, 1955 - October 5, 2011|url=https://arstechnica.com/apple/news/2011/10/steve-jobs-february-24-1955---october-5-2011.ars|website=www.arstechnica.com|accessdate=2012-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, media outlets had their hands full with the [[Occupy Wall Street Movement]] that was taking place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Forer|first=Ben|title=Occupy Wall St. Protests: Live Blog|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Business/Economy/occupy-wall-st-protests-live-blog/story?id=14675410|work=ABC News|accessdate=29 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Information about the oil spill did not surface on major news websites until four days later when [[CBC News]] published an article on 9 October 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=New Zealand Oil Spill Cleanup Begins Amid Storm Fears|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/story/2011/10/09/new-zealand-oil-spill.html|publisher=CBC|accessdate=29 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  British newspaper ''[[The Guardian]]'' then released a piece on the incident on 10 October 2011,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Milman|first=Oliver|title=New Zealand oil spill : conservationists warn of wildlife 'tragedy'|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/oct/10/new-zealand-oil-spill-wildlife-tragedy|work=The Guardian|accessdate=29 March 2012|location=London|date=10 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; followed by the [[BBC]] on 11 October 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Oil spill disaster New Zealand's 'worst in decades'|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-pacific-15251319|publisher=BBC|accessdate=29 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Residents of [[Motiti Island]] voiced their concerns over the effects the oil spill was having on their lifestyles, since they relied on water filled in tanks and seafood from the affected waters for survival. It cost islanders approximately $100 to leave the island for food or water; this expense along with the toxic water and seafood raised concern among the citizens of [[Motiti Island]] that their lives might never be the same.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Rena oil spill: Thursday as it happened|url=http://tvnz.co.nz/national-news/rena-oil-spill-thursday-happened-4462546|accessdate=28 March 2012|newspaper=BBCnews}}&lt;/ref&gt;

New Zealand environmental minister, [[Nick Smith (New Zealand politician)|Nick Smith]], said that the impact of this spill was the most significant in New Zealand history.
Reporter Karen Barlow of [[Lateline]] said that it may not be the biggest ever oil spill, but it could be catastrophic for the pristine waters of the Bay of Plenty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Barlow|first=Karen|title=New Zealand faces worst ever environmental disaster|url=http://www.abc.net.au/lateline/content/2011/s3337406.htm|publisher=ABC|accessdate=28 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[World Wildlife Fund]] spokesperson, Bob Zuur, confirmed a major loss of wildlife.&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news|title=Oil spill disaster New Zealand's 'worst in decades'|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-pacific-15251319|accessdate=28 March 2012|work=BBC News|date=11 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cleanup==
"The cleanup for the Rena Oil spill will take time," said New Zealand scientist Dr. Norm Duke. "[[Mineral oil|Petroleum oil]] will naturally break down - but this takes time and oxygenation. So, the longer the oil remains floating at sea - the safer it becomes. And, the rougher the weather - the better also."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Duke|first=Norm|title=Dr Norm Duke, Professorial Research Fellow, Mangrove Hub, James Cook University comments:|url=http://www.aussmc.org/2011/10/rapid-reaction-cleaning-up-the-rena-oil-spill-in-new-zealand-–-experts-respond/|accessdate=28 March 2012|date=10 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!--(the following bit needs work, and maybe relocation) When this first occurred, volunteers in the area helped out as much as possible.

[[Maritime New Zealand]] used the oil dispersant [[Corexit|Corexit 9500]] to help in the cleanup process. Corexit is known to increase the toxicity of oil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/environment/rena-crisis/5767822/Dispersants-worse-than-oil|title=Dispersants 'worse than oil'|work=Stuff|accessdate=14 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dispersant was applied for only a week, after results proved inconclusive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sciencelearn.org.nz/Science-Stories/Where-Land-Meets-Sea/Cleaning-up-the-oil-spill|title=Cleaning up the oil spill|work=Sciencelearn Hub|accessdate=14 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Salvage teams==
* As of 2011, there were approximately 400 trained responders to oil spills in the country. [[Marine Pollution Response Service]] advised that most of the responders had received low level training, estimating that only 60 of the 400 trained have achieved high level training. The Marine Pollution Response Service suggested that a higher level of training was required in various levels of response training. Also, there was a report of insufficient development in the information and training given to this team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Review of New Zealand’s Oil Pollution Preparedness and Response Capability  |url=http://www.maritimenz.govt.nz/Publications-and-forms/Environmental-protection/OPPRC-Review-February-2011.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A salvage company named Svitzer was hired to assess the safety of contracted salvage teams on the ship and to continue to carry out salvage procedures. Matthew Watson, a spokesman for Svitzer, described the key tasks carried out by the salvage teams to be removal of oil off of the ship (specifically through a transferring process) and the collection of released containers and other waste. Salvage teams were helicoptered onto the ship, as that was advised as the safest way.&lt;ref name="second-officer-charged" /&gt;

==Environmental impact==
*The fuel on board the ''Rena'' consisted of 1,700 tonnes of heavy oil and 200 tonnes of diesel fuel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Taylor|first=Alan|title=Oil Spill Disaster on New Zealand|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/infocus/2011/10/oil-spill-disaster-on-new-zealand-shoreline/100169/|work=The Atlantic|accessdate=28 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was thought that in the [[Bay of Plenty]] over a thousand tonnes of sand would need to be removed in order to get the oil out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Rena spill: Sand removal plan to get oil pollution off beaches|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10758937|work=[[New Zealand Herald]]|accessdate=28 March 2012|author=Isaac Davidson|author2=James Ihaka |date=14 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Over the duration of the event, 383 oiled little blue penguins were admitted to the oiled wildlife facility. 95% of these (365 penguins) were released back to the wild with 18 admitted birds dying (thirteen required euthanasia and another five died in care). 89 dead oiled penguins were recovered through the response.

[[World Wide Fund for Nature|WWF]] Rob Zuur explains "it would take years to know the full impact of the oil spill on the Bay of Plenty’s ecosystem, which also contains huge marine kelp forests and is home to a large fishing industry".&lt;ref name="Sands"/&gt; "Filter-feeding whales are at risk from sticky oil clinging to their baleen plates as they feed" said Al Fleming, Tauranga-based Central North Island field officer of New Zealand.&lt;ref name="http://www.ens--newswire.com"&gt;{{cite web|title=New Zealand's Biggest Oil Spill Worsens, Hits Beache|url=http://www.ens-newswire.com/ens/oct2011/2011-10-11-01.html|website=www.ens--newswire.com/|accessdate=28 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Fleming, the oil's effect on finfish, shellfish, crustaceans and other marine life could be disastrous.&lt;ref name="http://www.ens--newswire.com"/&gt; In addition, the oil will affect birds and marine mammals by ingestion, and bio-accumulation whereby the toxicity of the oil can be responsible for long or short term effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ma|first=Vienna|title=nterview: New Zealand's oil spills to have long term negative impacts on environment: experts|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english2010/indepth/2011-10/12/c_131187382.htm|agency=Xinhua|accessdate=28 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Blobs of heavy oil washed up on the beach shores of [[Mount Maunganui]] and [[Papamoa]], and were expected to continue to wash up in other parts of New Zealand. The beaches affected were closed until cleanup crews arrived, and locals were instructed to keep a distance from the shore and the oil clusters.&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk"/&gt;

==Political consequences==
The disaster occurred only seven weeks prior to the [[New Zealand general election, 2011|2011 general election]] (which took place on 26 November 2011) and partially affected the campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/environment/news/article.cfm?c_id=39&amp;objectid=10758891 |title=Rena oil-spill emergency winds up political leaders |work=New Zealand Herald |author=Audrey Young |date=2011-10-14 |accessdate=2011-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 14 October it was reported that the disaster had caused a 4% drop in the governing [[New Zealand National Party|National Party]]'s polling on the ''[[iPredict]]'' [[prediction market]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/5786118/Rena-disaster-hurts-National-site |title=Rena disaster hurts National - site  |website=[[Stuff.co.nz]] |date=2011-10-14 |accessdate=2011-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 13 October 2011, the [[New Zealand Labour Party]] announced that it would impose a moratorium on [[Offshore drilling|deep sea drilling for oil]] if elected to power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.3news.co.nz/Despite-Rena-disaster-Govt-still-keen-on-deep-sea-drilling/tabid/419/articleID/229430/Default.aspx |title=Rena Disaster sees Labour rush out policy to stop deep sea drilling |author=Patrick Gower |publisher=[[3 News]] |date=2011-10-13 |accessdate=2011-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012 the government announced a twelve-month environmental recovery plan for the area with an expected cost of NZ$2–3&amp;nbsp;million (US$1.6M–2.5M as of January 2012).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=Environmental Recovery plan for Rena launched|publisher=New Zealand government|date=26 January 2012|url=http://beehive.govt.nz/release/environmental-recovery-plan-rena-launched|accessdate=26 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criminal charges==
On 12 October 2011, the captain of ''Rena'' appeared in the Tauranga District Court charged with operating a vessel causing unnecessary danger or risk to a person or property.  He was granted name suppression and remanded on [[bail]].&lt;ref name=stuff1/&gt;  If convicted he faced a fine of up to $10,000 or up to 12 months imprisonment.&lt;ref name=nzh2&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10758416 |title=Rena oil spill: masks could be issued |work=New Zealand Herald|date=12 October 2011 |accessdate=12 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ship's second officer, who was responsible for navigation at the time of the accident, was subsequently charged and appeared in court on 13 October.&lt;ref name="second-officer-charged"&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10758590 |title=Rena spill: Second officer charged |work=New Zealand Herald |date=12 October 2011 |accessdate=12 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The two men, both Filipino, pleaded guilty to 11 charges between them, including attempting to pervert the course of justice (based on alleged alteration of navigational documents after the collision).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.3news.co.nz/nznews/crown-outlines-rena-case-ahead-of-sentencing-2012052511|title=Crown outlines Rena case ahead of sentencing|publisher=|accessdate=14 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sentencing for both men was scheduled for 25 May 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=New Zealand container shipwreck captain pleads guilty|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/feb/29/new-zealand-oil-spill-guilty|accessdate=27 March 2012|newspaper=theguardian|location=London|date=29 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The (New Zealand) [[Transport Accident Investigation Commission]] released an interim report into the grounding on 8 March 2012. The report states only what happened but not why, and does not apportion blame. It states that ''Rena'' arrived at the port of [[Napier, New Zealand|Napier]] and began unloading cargo, but was forced to stand off in the harbour when a ship with priority booking arrived. ''Rena'' was therefore delayed 13 hours in leaving Napier. On making the run toward Tauranga, the captain was under pressure to make up time and to arrive at the port's pilot station by 3:00 am, and the ship's charts showed that a more direct course than usual had been set that took ''Rena'' toward Astrolabe Reef. An intermittent radar echo first noticed at 2:05 am was ignored when nothing was seen through binoculars, and at 2:14 ''Rena'' struck the reef.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.taic.org.nz/ReportsandSafetyRecs/MarineReports/Renasgroundingdetailinaccidentreport/tabid/244/language/en-US/Default.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Transport Accident Investigation Commission - full report (first page is blank) http://www.taic.org.nz/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=1O0%2bnlsp%2fBQ%3d&amp;tabid=87&amp;language=en-US&lt;/ref&gt;

On 25 May 2012, the captain and navigation officer appeared in Tauranga District Court for sentencing. Each was sentenced to 7 months imprisonment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10808468|title=Rena captain jailed for 7 months|work=The New Zealand Herald|accessdate=14 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Treaty of Waitangi case==
Three Bay of Plenty iwi groups have launched a breach of the Treaty of Waitangi case against the Crown. Their key concern is that they were not adequately consulted in regard to the Crown agreeing to receive $10 million as compensation for the remains of the wreck not being removed. The government agreed to the compensation payment when a storm caused the remains of the wreck to fall off the reef onto the seabed and marine demolition experts said it was too dangerous to remove it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title='Remove Rena cancer' - iwi |first=Elton |last=Smallman |url= http://www.stuff.co.nz/waikato-times/10216680/Remove-Rena-cancer-Iwi |newspaper=Waikato Times |date=1 July 2014 |accessdate=9 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Past spills==
The second most extreme oil spill New Zealand has experienced since 1990 was the Jody F. Millennium log ship incident.&lt;ref name="newzealand.govt.nz"&gt;{{cite web|title=Major oil spills around New Zealand|url=http://www.maritimenz.govt.nz/Environmental/Responding-to-spills-and-pollution/Past-spill-responses/Past-spill-responses.asp |publisher=newzealand.govt.nz |accessdate=28 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ship broke free from several of her moorings in [[Gisborne, New Zealand|Gisborne]] Harbour due to huge swells on Wednesday 6 February 2002.&lt;ref name="newzealand.govt.nz"/&gt;  Tugboats attempted to bring the ship alongside the wharf, but it was then decided to take the ship to sea.&lt;ref name="newzealand.govt.nz"/&gt;  A big swell hit the ship which then grounded on the beach.&lt;ref name="newzealand.govt.nz"/&gt; An estimated 25 tonnes of fuel oil leaked out of the ship.&lt;ref name="newzealand.govt.nz"/&gt;

In [[theoretical physics]], a '''roton''' is an elementary excitation, or [[quasiparticle]], in [[superfluid helium-4]]. The [[dispersion relation]] of elementary excitations in this [[superfluid]] shows a [[linear]] increase from the origin, but exhibits first a maximum and then a minimum in [[energy]] as the [[momentum]] increases. Excitations with momenta in the linear region are called [[phonon]]s; those with momenta close to the minimum are called rotons. Excitations with momenta near the maximum are sometimes called [[Maxon excitation|maxon]]s.

The term "roton" is also used for the quantised [[eigenmode]] of a freely [[Rotational spectroscopy|rotating molecule]].{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

==Models==
Originally, the roton spectrum was phenomenologically introduced by [[Lev Landau]]. Currently there exist [[Superfluid helium-4#Theory|different models]] which try to explain the roton spectrum, with different degrees of success and fundamentality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Fingerprinting Rotons in a Dipolar Condensate: Super-Poissonian Peak in the Atom-Number Fluctuations|last = |first = |date = 26 June 2013|journal = Phys.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13131">A '''solar bus''' or '''solar-charged bus''' is a [[bus]] which is powered exclusively or mainly by [[solar energy]].  A solar-powered bus service is referred to as a '''solar bus service'''.  The use of the term "solar bus" normally implies that solar energy is used not only for powering electric equipment on the bus, but also for the [[propulsion]] of the vehicle.

Existing solar buses are [[battery electric bus]]es or (in the case of hybrid solar buses) [[hybrid bus]]es equipped with [[Electric-vehicle battery|batteries]] which are recharged from solar (or other) power sources; a launch of a solar bus service often goes hand in hand with investments for large-scale installations of stationary [[solar panel]]s with [[photovoltaic cell]]s.  Similarly as other [[solar vehicle]]s, many solar buses have photovoltaic cells contained in [[solar panel]]s on the vehicle's roof which convert the [[sun]]'s energy directly into [[electric energy]] to be used by the engine.

The introduction of solar buses and other [[green vehicle]]s for purposes of [[public transport]] forms a part of [[sustainable transport]] schemes.

== About ==

=== Solar-only and solar-electric bus services ===
The distinction between a solar-only electric bus and an electro-solar bus is fluid, as the distinction depends on the actual usage: whether the bus is recharged from solar or other power sources.

Solar-only bus services involve recharging the bus from solar energy, usually from solar panel-covered [[bus station]] [[Canopy (building)|canopies]].  The concept is similar to that of [[solar parking plot]] for cars and bicycles, where vehicles can re-charge while parked.  The need for recharging poses constraints on the run and standstill times of the bus.  The implementation of a solar bus service benefits from an optimization of over-all requirements for the specific bus service.&lt;ref name="ait-2013"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ait.ac.at/fileadmin/cmc/downloads/Magazine/Neu/Tomorrow_Today_Dezember_2011_en.pdf |pages=22–25 |title=The right drive for e-mobility |publisher= |date=December 2011 |accessdate=2013-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Electro-solar buses are powered additionally from electric power [[Electric power transmission|transmitted]] from power plants; hybrid solar buses may be equipped with [[hybrid engine]]s.

=== Commercially available shuttle buses ===
Open air low-speed electric shuttle sightseeing buses equipped with a solar panel-covered roof are produced in series and are commercially available.  According to the producers, the solar panels save energy and prolong the battery life cycle.

== Use ==

=== Australia ===
The '''Tindo''' solar battery-charged bus ("Tindo", [[Kaurna language|Kaurna]] word for ''sun'') is an experimental [[battery electric vehicle]] that operates in [[Adelaide|Adelaide, Australia]]. It is the world's first solar bus, operating since 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mnn.com/green-tech/transportation/photos/7-modern-solar-powered-vehicles/tindo-solar-bus |title=7 modern solar-powered vehicles: Tindo Solar Bus &amp;#124; MNN - Mother Nature Network |publisher=MNN |date= |accessdate=2013-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; It uses 100% solar power, is equipped with a [[Regenerative brake|regenerative braking system]] and air conditioning and can carry up to 40 persons,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first1=Kien |last1=To |first2=John E. |last2=Fernández |title=Alternative urban technologies demonstration projects for innovative cities |work=Third International Engineering Systems Symposium, CESUN 2012, Delft University of Technology |date=18–20 June 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 25 of whom are seated.  The bus itself is not equipped with solar panels.  It receives electric power from a [[photovoltaics|photovoltaic]] system on Adelaide's central [[bus station]].  Hailed as the world's first bus service powered exclusively by solar power, the bus service connects Adelaide City and North Adelaide as part of Adelaide City's sustainable transport agenda.  The Tindo is part of the 98A and 98C bus service (until recently known as the Adelaide Connector) which is offered as [[free public transport]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ecogeek.org/content/view/1245/ |title=All-Electric, Solar-Powered, Free Bus!!! |publisher=Ecogeek.org |date=2007-12-27 |accessdate=2013-01-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090908184215/http://www.ecogeek.org/content/view/1245/ |archivedate=2009-09-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://yoursay.adelaidecitycouncil.com/city-connector-bus |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-10-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222075212/http://yoursay.adelaidecitycouncil.com/city-connector-bus |archivedate=2015-12-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== China ===
Within the Chinese government's program for clean transport sector, [[China]]'s first solar hybrid buses were put in operation in July 2012 in the city of [[Qiqihar]]. Its engine is powered by [[lithium-ion battery|lithium-ion batteries]] which are fed by solar panels installed on the bus roof. It is claimed that each bus consumes 0.6 to 0.7 kilowatt-hours of electricity per kilometer and can transport up to 100 persons, and that the use of solar panels prolongs the batteries' lifetime by 35 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://naftcenews.wvu.edu/naftc_enews/2012/9/7/china-reveals-new-solar-buses |title=China Reveals New Solar Buses |publisher=[[West Virginia University]] |date=2012-09-07 |accessdate=2013-01-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151009112858/http://naftcenews.wvu.edu/naftc_enews/2012/9/7/china-reveals-new-solar-buses |archivedate=2015-10-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Europe ===
Austria's first solar-powered bus was put in operation in the village of [[Perchtoldsdorf]]. Its [[powertrain]], operating strategy, and [[design specification]] were specifically optimized in view of its planned regular service routes.  It has been in trial operation since autumn 2011.&lt;ref name="ait-2013"/&gt;

The [[Hybrid electric bus#Tribrid Bus|tribrid bus]] is a [[hybrid electric bus]] developed by the [[University of Glamorgan]], [[Wales]], for use as student transport between the University’s different campuses.  It is powered by [[hydrogen fuel]] or [[solar cell]]s, batteries and [[ultracapacitor]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |title=Green 'tribrid' minibus unveiled|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/wales/7436908.stm |work=BBC |date=2008-06-05 |accessdate=2013-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |title=Launch of Europe's First Tribrid Green Minibus |url=http://news.glam.ac.uk/news/en/2008/may/30/launch-europes-first-tibrid-green-minibus/ |work= |date=2008-05-30 |accessdate=2013-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== UK ===

The first Solar Bus in the UK launched in [[Brighton]] April 2017. Following a marathon six week effort from hundreds of local people, [[The Big Lemon]] and [[Brighton Energy Coop]]'s joint Solar Bus project has won funding from the M&amp;S Community Energy Fund to cover the roof of [[The Big Lemon]]’s bus depot in solar panels to power the new electric buses on clean green renewable energy.  The bus was named by one of the Solar Roof partners, Viper IT Solutions and is called "Om Shanti".

The 120 solar panels will generate 30,000kW of electricity – the equivalent of 1.8 million boiled kettles. With no emissions, the Solar Buses will reduce noxious gases in some of Brighton and Hove’s most polluted areas and will power the 52 route between Woodingdean and [[Brighton]] on 100% renewable energy.

The Solar Bus project was one of 199 different applications to the scheme, 125 of which were shortlisted.  These were put to public vote for six weeks during September and October and the voting process also included the option to donate to the project via the Crowdfunding platform.

The Solar Bus project was one of 19 regional winners, with 1549 votes, 170 pledges, and a total of £13,325 raised through crowdfunding, almost half the total amount of £28,798 raised through the scheme nationally.  The project will benefit from £12,500 funding from M&amp;S Energy which, together with the £13,325 crowdfunding donations will fund the solar array on the roof of the bus depot.

===Uganda===
The Kayoola Solar Bus is a 35-seater electric solar bus with zero tailpipe emissions, a range of 80 km, with latent range extension from the real-time charging enabled by the roof mounted solar panels. The development of the Kayoola Solar Bus Concept represents the commitment of the Kiira Motors Project to championing the progressive development of local capacity for Vehicle Technology Innovation, a key ingredient for institutionalizing a sustainable Vehicle Manufacturing Industry in Uganda. &lt;ref&gt;http://edition.cnn.com/2016/02/15/africa/africa-solar-bus-kiira-uganda/index.html?iid=ob_lockedrail_topeditorial&amp;iref=obnetwork&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://kiiramotors.com/kayoola.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
The Solar Buzz is a 14-seater US Electricar bus, made in 1994, that has been repurposed as the world's first truly solar bus in [[Truth or Consequences, New Mexico]] in 2011.  The Buzz has 2 KW in homemade solar panels on the roof, 40 golf cart batteries, 2 electric motors, and has no tailpipe.  The power required to go one mile is the same as the power required to make a pot of coffee:  around 700 Wh.  The Solar Buzz is an IntraCity bus approved by the state Public Regulation Commission (#56817) in 2015 and is a commercial daytime private shuttle service with a US$3 Fare, operated by Hot Springs Transit, LLC.  &lt;ref&gt;http://krqe.com/2016/01/28/new-mexico-woman-invents-states-first-solar-powered-bus/&lt;/ref&gt; Hot Springs Transit provides transit service to the 6100 person population of Truth or Consequences.

== Other forms of green bus transport ==

=== Non-solar powered engines ===
Solar panels are also used for powering electronic devices of the bus such as heating and air conditioning, even in buses with non-solar-powered engine. In the US, such buses are advertised to meet [[anti-idling]] regulations in several states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |title=Bauer introduces solar bus powering system at BusCon |url=http://www.metro-magazine.com/news/story/2010/10/gary-bauer-introduces-solar-bus-powering-system-at-buscon.aspx |work=metro magazine |date=2010-10-06 |accessdate=2013-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Refitting existing non-existing vehicles with photovoltaic panels that feed the original battery with additional electric power has been shown to have the potential for making a substantial contribution to [[CO2 emission]] mitigation and to the [[pollution prevention|reduction of pollution]].&lt;ref name="Donno-2012"&gt;{{cite news |first1=Monica |last1=Donno |first2=Aleck |last2=Ferrari |first3=Annalisa |last3=Scarpelli |first4=Pietro |last4=Perlo |first5=Alberto |last5=Bocca |title=Mechatronic system for energy efficiency in bus transport |url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/login.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=6176493&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fieeexplore.ieee.org%2Fxpls%2Fabs_all.jsp%3Farnumber%3D6176493 |work=Design, Automation &amp; Test in Europe Conference &amp; Exhibition, 2012 |pages=342–343 |date=12–16 March 2012 |accessdate=2013-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The thus transformed buses are however not solar buses in the strict sense of the word, as they do not use solar energy for propulsion.  The use of buses in public transport implies frequent stops with the opening and closing of doors, which influence the way the energy of the battery is used.&lt;ref name="Donno-2012"/&gt;

=== Renewable energy powered ===
In principle also [[trolleybus]]es or other non-autonomous electric buses or alternately powered buses such as [[fuel cell bus]]es or [[dual-mode bus]]es could be used for solar bus services, provided the origin of all or most of the energy used for propulsing the bus would be solar energy. In practice however such systems also draw on other sources of energy, at least also other [[renewable energy]] sources such as [[wind energy]]. An example is that the city of [[Hamburg]], Germany, received the 2011 [[European Green Capital Award]] for, among others, its fuel cell bus service that is claimed to be the world's largest hydrogen-powered bus fleet and is intended to use hydrogen generated from solar and wind energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/environment/europeangreencapital/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/Hamburg_DE_LowResolution_DE-new1.pdf |page=8 |title=Hamburg, Preisträger 2011,  |publisher=[[European Commission]] |date= |language=German |accessdate=2013-01-13}}, {{DOI|10.2779/78216}}, {{ISBN|978-92-79-21368-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tetrakis[3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]borate''' is an [[anion]] with chemical formula [{3,5-(CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;}&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;B]&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;, which is commonly abbreviated as [BAr&lt;sup&gt;F&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; as the [[boron]] atom (B) is surrounded by four fluorinated [[aryl]] (Ar&lt;sup&gt;F&lt;/sup&gt;) groups.  It is sometimes referred to as ''Kobayashi's anion'' in honour of Hiroshi Kobayashi who led the team that first synthesised it,&lt;ref name = Kobayashi&gt;{{Cite journal|last1 = Nishida|first1 = H.|first2 = N.|last2 = Takada|first3 = M.|last3 = Yoshimura|first4 = T.|last4 = Sonods|first5 = H.|last5 = Kobayshi|title = Tetrakis(3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl)borate.

The motivation for its preparation was the search for an anion which [[non-coordinating anion|coordinates more weakly]] than the then-available ions [[hexafluorophosphate]], [[tetrafluoroborate]], or [[perchlorate]].&lt;ref name = Brookhart&gt;{{Cite journal|first1 = M.|last1 = Brookhart|first2 = B.|last2 = Grant|first3 = A.

BARF can be used in [[catalyst|catalytic systems]] where the active site requires an anion which will not coordinate to the metal centre and interfere with the [[catalytic cycle]], such as in the preparation of [[polyketone]]s.&lt;ref name = catalyst&gt;{{cite journal|title = Palladium(II) catalysts for living alternating copolymerization of olefins and carbon monoxide|first1 = M.|last1 = Brookhart|authorlink1 = Maurice Brookhart|first2 = F.

==Synthesis of sodium BARF==
The sodium [[salt (chemistry)|salt]] of the BARF ion is abbreviated NaBAr&lt;sup&gt;F&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (or sometimes as NaBArF&lt;sub&gt;24&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;ref name = Bergman /&gt; recognising the 24 [[fluorine]] [[atom]]s in each BARF ion).  It was first prepared by a group led by Kobayashi and reported in 1984.&lt;ref name = Kobayashi /&gt;  A [[Grignard reaction|Grignard reagent]] was prepared by reacting 1-iodo-3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)benzene with [[magnesium]] metal in [[anhydrous|dry]] [[diethyl ether]] ([[ethyl group|Et]]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O) to form 3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)phenylmagnesium iodide, Ar&lt;sup&gt;F&lt;/sup&gt;MgI where Ar&lt;sup&gt;F&lt;/sup&gt; = 3,5-(CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.  An ethereal solution of [[boron trifluoride]] is then added to this Grignard and the purified salt produced in 84% [[yield (chemistry)|yield]] after [[workup (chemistry)|workup]] and [[column chromatography]].&lt;ref name = Kobayashi /&gt;

:BF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.OEt&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;nbsp; + &amp;nbsp; 4 Ar&lt;sup&gt;F&lt;/sup&gt;MgI &amp;nbsp; + &amp;nbsp; NaF &amp;nbsp; → &amp;nbsp; 4 MgIF &amp;nbsp; + &amp;nbsp; NaBAr&lt;sup&gt;F&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;nbsp; + &amp;nbsp; OEt&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

A safer synthesis has since been developed, utilising the magnesium-bromine exchange reaction between 1-bromo-3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)benzene and isopropylmagnesium chloride to generate the required aryl-Grignard reagent, which is then reacted with [[sodium tetrafluoroborate]].&lt;ref name = Bergman /&gt;

:NaBF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;nbsp; + &amp;nbsp; 4 Ar&lt;sup&gt;F&lt;/sup&gt;MgBr &amp;nbsp; → &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; NaBAr&lt;sup&gt;F&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;nbsp; + &amp;nbsp; 4 MgBrF

==Properties==
[[Non-coordinating anion]]s are anions that interact only weakly with cations, a useful property when studying highly [[electrophilic]] cations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Krossing | first1 = I. | last2 = Raabe | first2 = I. | title = Noncoordinating Anions - Fact or Fiction?

Hexafluorophosphate is a non-coordinating anion in both senses of the term.&lt;ref name = "Davies_1996"&gt;{{cite book| title = Synthetic Coordination Chemistry: Principles and Practice| last1 = Davies| first1 = J.

A]] | issue = 14 | pages = 2279–2281 | doi = 10.1039/J19710002279}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it is deliberately used for this property.  BARF was developed as a new non-coordinating anion in the 1990s, and is far less coordinating than even the hexafluorophosphate anion.&lt;ref name = Brookhart /&gt;

==Proposal==
According to early papers (see History section), tidal disruption events should be an inevitable consequence of massive black holes activity hidden in galaxy nuclei, whereas later theorists concluded that the resulting explosion or flare of radiation from the accretion of the stellar debris could be a unique signpost for the presence of a dormant black hole in the center of a normal galaxy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gezari|first1=Suvi|title=Tidal Disruption Events|journal=Brazilian Journal of Physics|date=11 June 2013|volume=43|issue=5–6|pages=351–355|doi=10.1007/s13538-013-0136-z|bibcode = 2013BrJPh..43..351G }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
It was in 1971 that for the first time the theorist John A. Wheeler&lt;ref&gt;Wheeler,J.A., 1971, Pontificae Acad. Sei. Scripta Varia, 35, 539&lt;/ref&gt; suggested that the breakup of a star in the ergosphere of a rotating black hole could induce acceleration of the released gas to relativistic speeds by the so-called "tube of toothpaste effect". Wheeler succeeded in applying the relativistic generalization of the classical Newtonian tidal disruption problem to the neighborhood of a Schwarzschild or a Kerr black hole (without axial rotation or in rotation, cf. Fishbone (1973) and Mashhoon (1975, 1977)). But these early works restricted their attention to incompressible star models
and/or to stars penetrating slightly into the Roche radius, thus undergoing only tides of small amplitudes or, at best, only quiescent disruption phenomena (aka the future TDE).

In 1976 in the "MNRAS"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |bibcode = 1976MNRAS.176..633F|title = Effects of massive black holes on dense stellar systems|journal = Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society|volume = 176|issue = 3|pages = 633–647|last1 = Frank|first1 = J.|last2 = Rees|first2 = M. J.|year = 1976|doi = 10.1093/mnras/176.3.633}}&lt;/ref&gt; astronomers Juhan Frank and Martin F. Rees of the Cambridge Institute of Astronomy evoked for the first time "the effect of massive black holes on stellar systems ", defining a critical radius under which stars are disturbed and literally sucked up by the black hole, suggesting that it is possible to observe these events in certain galaxies. But at the time, the English researchers did not propose any precise model or simulation.

This speculative prediction and this lack of theoretical tools aroused the curiosity of Jean-Pierre Luminet and Brandon Carter of the Paris Observatory in the early 1980s who invented the concept of TDE. 
Their first works were published in 1982 in the journal "Nature"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1038/296211a0| title=Pancake detonation of stars by black holes in galactic nuclei| journal=Nature| volume=296| issue=5854| pages=211–214| year=1982| last1=Carter| first1=B.| last2=Luminet| first2=J. P.|bibcode = 1982Natur.296..211C}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1983 in the "Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |bibcode = 1983A&amp;A...121...97C|title = Tidal compression of a star by a large black hole. I Mechanical evolution and nuclear energy release by proton capture|journal = Astronomy and Astrophysics|volume = 121|issue = 1|pages = 97|last1 = Carter|first1 = B.|last2 = Luminet|first2 = J. -P.|year = 1983}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The authors had managed to describe the tidal disturbances in the heart of AGNs based on the "stellar pancake outbreak" model to use Luminet's expression, a model describing the tide field generated by a "big black hole" - let's say supermassive - and the effect they called the "pancake detonation" to qualify the radiation outbreak resulting from these disturbances.

Then in 1986, Luminet and Carter published in the journal "Astrophysical Journal Supplement"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |bibcode = 1986ApJS...61..219L|title = Dynamics of an Affine Star Model in a Black Hole Tidal Field|journal = The Astrophysical Journal Supplement Series|volume = 61|pages = 219|last1 = Luminet|first1 = J. -P|last2 = Carter|first2 = B.|year = 1986|doi = 10.1086/191113}}&lt;/ref&gt; an important article of 29 pages in which they analyzed all the cases of TDE and not only the 10% producing "spaghettifications" and other "pancakes flambées".

It was only a decade later, in 1990, that the first TDE-compliant candidates were detected through NASA's "All Sky" X-ray survey of NASA's ROSAT satellite&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/rosat/rass.html | title=The ROSAT All Sky Survey}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Since then, more than a dozen candidates have been discovered, including more active sources in ultraviolet or visible for a reason that remained mysterious.

== Discovery ==
Finally, the theory of Luminet and Carter was confirmed by the observation of spectacular eruptions resulting from the accretion of stellar debris by a massive object located in the heart of the AGN (e.g. NGC 5128 or NGC 4438) but also in the heart of the Milky Way (Sgr A *). The TDE theory even explains the superluminous supernova [[SN 2015L]], better known by the code name ASASSN-15lh, a marial&lt;!-- what's that? --&gt; supernova that exploded just before being absorbed beneath the horizon of a massive black hole. 

Today, all TDEs have been listed in "The Open TDE Catalog"&lt;ref&gt;https://tde.space/&lt;/ref&gt; run by the Harvard CfA, which has had 87 entries since 1999.

The theoretical interpretation of the TDEs was finally described in 2004 by Stephanie Komossa of the Max Plank Institute (MPE / MPG) and again recently in 2014. Let us also mention the work of the teams of Suvi Gezari (2006), Geoffrey C. Bower (2011 ) as well as J. Guillochon and E.Ramirez-Ruiz (2015) and Jane Dai et al. (2018).

== New observations ==
In September 2016, a team from the [[University of Science and Technology of China]] in [[Hefei]], [[Anhui]], China, announced that, using data from [[NASA]]{{'s}} [[Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer]], a stellar tidal disruption event was observed at a known black hole. Another team at [[Johns Hopkins University]] in [[Baltimore]], [[Maryland]], U.S., detected three additional events. In each case, astronomers hypothesized that the [[astrophysical jet]] created by the dying star would emit ultraviolet and X-ray radiation, which would be absorbed by dust surrounding the black hole and emitted as infrared radiation. Not only was this infrared emission detected, but they concluded that the delay between the jet's emission of ultraviolet and X-ray radiation and the dust's emission of infrared radiation may be used to estimate the size of the black hole devouring the star.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Gray|first=Richard|title=Echoes of a stellar massacre: Gasps of dying stars as they are torn apart by supermassive black holes are detected|work=Daily Mail|date=16 September 2016|accessdate=16 September 2016|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-3793042/Echoes-stellar-massacre-Gasps-dying-stars-torn-apart-supermassive-black-holes-detected.html|postscript=none}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=van Velzen|first1=Sjoert|last2=Mendez|first2=Alexander J.|last3=Krolik|first3=Julian H.|last4=Gorjian|first4=Varoujan|title=Discovery of transient infrared emission from dust heated by stellar tidal disruption flares|journal=The Astrophysical Journal|date=15 September 2016|volume=829|issue=1|page=19|doi=10.3847/0004-637X/829/1/19|postscript=none|bibcode=2016ApJ...829...19V|arxiv = 1605.04304 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jiang|first1=Ning|last2=Dou|first2=Liming|last3=Wang|first3=Tinggui|last4=Yang|first4=Chenwei|last5=Lyu|first5=Jianwei|last6=Zhou|first6=Hongyan|title=The [[Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer|WISE]] Detection of an Infrared Echo in Tidal Disruption Event [[ASASSN-14li]]|journal=The Astrophysical Journal Letters|date=1 September 2016|volume=828|issue=1|page=L14|doi=10.3847/2041-8205/828/1/L14|bibcode=2016ApJ...828L..14J|arxiv = 1605.04640 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Torpex''' is a [[secondary explosive]], 50% more powerful than [[Trinitrotoluene|TNT]] by mass.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gannon|1996|p=183}}&lt;/ref&gt; Torpex comprises 42% [[RDX]], 40% TNT and 18% [[Powder (substance)|powdered]] [[aluminium]]. It was used in the [[Second World War]] from late 1942. The name is short for ''torpedo explosive'', having been originally developed for use in [[torpedo]]es. Torpex proved to be particularly useful in underwater munitions because the aluminium component had the effect of making the explosive pulse last longer, which increased the destructive power. Torpex was used only in critical applications, e.g. torpedoes, [[depth charge]]s, and the [[Bouncing bomb|Upkeep]], [[Tallboy bomb|Tallboy]], and [[Grand Slam bomb|Grand Slam]] bombs. It was also used in the [[Operation Aphrodite]] drones. Torpex has long been superseded by [[Composition H6|H6]] and [[Polymer-bonded explosive|PBX]] compositions. It is therefore regarded as [[obsolete]], so Torpex is unlikely to be encountered except in old munitions or [[unexploded ordnance]].

==Development==
Torpex was developed at the [[Waltham Abbey Royal Gunpowder Mills|Royal Gunpowder Factory, Waltham Abbey]], in the United Kingdom as a more powerful military alternative to TNT. [[RDX]] was developed in 1899. Though very stable and serving as the reference point by which the sensitivity of other explosives are judged, it was too expensive for most military applications and reserved for use in the most important products, such as torpedoes. Aluminium powder was also added to the mix to further enhance the effect. Although both RDX and TNT have a negative [[oxygen balance]], the superheated aluminium component tends to contribute primarily by extending the expansion time of the explosive product gases. [[Beeswax]] was also added as a [[phlegmatized|phlegmatizing]] agent, to reduce sensitivity to shock and impact. Later, beeswax was replaced with [[paraffin wax]], and [[calcium chloride]] was added as a moisture absorber to reduce the production of [[hydrogen]] gas under high humidity.

'''Triatomic molecules''' are [[molecule]]s composed of three [[atom]]s, of either the same or different [[chemical element]]s. Examples include [[Water|H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O]], [[Carbon dioxide|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] (pictured) and [[Hydrogen cyanide|HCN]].

==Molecular vibrations==

The [[Molecular vibration|vibrational modes]] of a triatomic molecule can be determined in specific cases.

=== Symmetric linear molecules ===
A symmetric linear molecule ABA can perform:
* Antisymmetric longitudinal vibrations with frequency
:&lt;math&gt;\omega_a=\sqrt{\frac{k_1M}{m_Am_B}}&lt;/math&gt;
* Symmetric longitudinal vibrations with frequency
:&lt;math&gt;\omega_{s1}=\sqrt{\frac{k_1}{m_A}}&lt;/math&gt;
* Symmetric transversal vibrations with frequency
:&lt;math&gt;\omega_{s2}=\sqrt{\frac{2k_2M}{m_Am_B}}&lt;/math&gt; 
In the previous formulas, ''M'' is the total mass of the molecule, ''m&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''m&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;'' are the masses of the elements A and B, ''k''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''k''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are the spring constants of the molecule along its axis and perpendicular to it.

==Types==
===Homonuclear===
Homonuclear triatomic molecules contain three of the same kind of atom.
[[File:Trihydrogen-cation-3D-vdW.png|thumb|left|[[Trihydrogen cation]]]][[File:Ozone-elpot-3D-vdW.png|thumb|right|Ozone]]
[[Ozone]], O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is an example of a triatomic molecule with all atoms the same.  [[Triatomic hydrogen]], H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, is unstable and breaks up spontaneously.  H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, the [[trihydrogen cation]] is stable by itself and is symmetric.
&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;He&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, the [[helium trimer]] is only weakly bound by [[van der Waals force]] and is in a [[Efimov state]].&lt;ref name=Kunitski15&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kunitski|first1=M.|last2=Zeller|first2=S.|last3=Voigtsberger|first3=J.|last4=Kalinin|first4=A.|last5=Schmidt|first5=L.

==Geometry==
All triatomic molecules may be classified as possessing either a linear, bent or cyclic geometry.
===Linear===
Linear triatomic molecules owe their geometry to their '''''sp''''' or '''''sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;d''''' hybridised central atoms. Well known linear triatomic molecules include Carbon Dioxide (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and Hydrogen Cyanide (HCN). 

[[Xenon difluoride]] (XeF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) is one of the rare examples of a linear triatomic molecule possessing non-bonded pairs of electrons on the central atom.

[[Image:Skiing Christmas '05 034.jpg|thumb|right|[[Hoar frost]] that grows on the snow surface due to water vapor moving up through the snow on cold, clear nights]]
'''Types of snow''' can be designated by the shape of its flakes, description of how it is falling, and by how it collects on the ground.  A [[blizzard]] and [[snow]] storm indicate heavy snowfalls over a large area, snow squalls give heavy snowfalls over narrow bands, while [[Snow flurry|flurries]] are used for the lightest snowfall.  Types which fall in the form of a ball, rather than a [[snowflake|flake]], are known as [[graupel]], with sleet and snow grains as types of graupel.  Once on the ground, snow can be categorized as powdery when fluffy, granular when it begins the cycle of melting and refreezing, and crud or eventually [[ice]] once it packs down into a dense drift after multiple melting and refreezing cycles.  When powdering, snow drifts with the [[wind]] or [[ground blizzard]], sometimes to the depth of several metres.  After attaching to hillsides, blown snow can evolve into a snow slab, which is an [[avalanche]] hazard on steep slopes.

== While falling ==
[[File:20080307 Niagara Square to Lafayette Square.JPG|thumb|A [[snow flurry]] viewed from [[Buffalo City Hall]]]]
Snowfall's intensity is determined by visibility.  When the visibility is over {{convert|1|km|mi}}, snow is determined to be light.  Moderate snow describes snowfall with visibility restrictions between {{convert|.5|km|mi}} and {{convert|1|km|mi}}.  Heavy snowfall describes conditions when visibility is restricted below {{convert|.5|km|mi}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Snow|author=Glossary of Meteorology|url=http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/search?id=snow1|publisher=[[American Meteorological Society]]|year=2009|accessdate=2009-06-28|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090220090504/http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/search?id=snow1|archivedate=20 February 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other terms for falling snow:
;[[Thundersnow]]
: A [[thunderstorm]] which produces snow as the primary form of precipitation.
;[[Blizzard]]
: A long-lasting snow storm with intense snowfall and usually high winds. Particularly severe storms can create [[whiteout (weather)|whiteout]] conditions where visibility is severely reduced.
;[[Winter storm|Snow storm]]
: Usually, a long [[storm]] of relatively heavy snow, similar to a blizzard but without the wind requirement. 
;[[Snowsquall]]
: A brief, very intense snowstorm.
;[[Snow flurry]]
: Describes a period of light snow with occasional moderate snowfall but usually little accumulation.
;[[Lake-effect snow]]
: Produced when cold winds move across long expanses of warmer lake water, picking up water vapour which freezes and is deposited inland.
;Sleet
: In [[Canada]], [[United Kingdom|Britain]], [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], and some parts of the [[US]]: [[Rain and snow mixed|rain mixed with snow]].  In much of the US sleet means [[ice pellets]] formed when snowflakes pass through a layer of warm air, partially or completely thaw, then refreeze upon passing through sufficiently cold air during further descent.
;[[Diamond dust]]
: Describes a fine mist of tiny frozen ice crystals.

==Shapes==
{{Main article|Snowflake#Classification}}
[[Image:Snowflake 300um LTSEM, 13368.jpg|right|thumb|A column type snowflake.]]
;[[Columnar snow crystal|Columns]]
:A class of [[snowflake]]s that is shaped like a six sided column.
;[[Dendrite (crystal)|Dendrites]]
:A class of snowflakes that has 6 points, making it somewhat star shaped.  The classic snowflake shape.
;[[Graupel]]
: Precipitation formed when freezing fog condenses on a snowflake, forming a ball of rime ice. Also known as snow pellets and soft hail.
;Needles
:A class of snowflakes that are acicular in shape (their length is much longer than their diameter, like a needle)
;[[Rimed snow]]
:Snowflakes that are partially or completely coated in tiny frozen water droplets called rime. Rime forms on a snowflake when it passes through a super-cooled cloud.

[[Image:Sbsnow 2.jpg|thumb|right|Snowfall in [[San Bernardino, California|San Bernardino]], [[California]], [[United States]]]]

;[[Snowmaking|Artificial snow]]
: Snow can be also manufactured using [[snow cannon]]s, which actually create tiny granules more like soft hail (this is sometimes called "grits" by those in the [[Southern United States|southern U.S.]] for its likeness to the texture of the [[grits|food]]). In recent years, snow cannons have been produced that create more natural-looking snow, but these machines are prohibitively expensive.{{According to whom|date=January 2018}}
;[[Blowing snow]]
: Snow on ground that is being moved around by wind. See [[ground blizzard]].
;Champagne powder
: Very smooth and dry snow, which is good for [[skiing]]. The term originates from the ski resorts in the [[Rocky Mountains]], which often have these snow conditions. The [[Steamboat Ski Resort]], in [[Steamboat Springs, Colorado]], holds the trademark&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Champagne Powder|url=http://tess2.uspto.gov/bin/showfield?f=doc&amp;state=4802:y2qj8z.2.2|publisher=[[United States Patent and Trademark Office]]|accessdate=2013-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; for the term Champagne Powder. The name derives from the [[sparkling wine]] [[Champagne (wine)|champagne]].
; Chopped powder
: Powder snow that has been cut up by previous skiers.
;Corn
: Coarse, granular wet snow. Most commonly used by skiers describing good spring snow. Corn is the result of cycles of melting during the day and refreezing at night.
;[[Cornice (snow)|Cornice]]
: An overhanging formation of windblown snow. Important in skiing and alpine climbing because the overhang can be unstable and hard to see from the windward side.
;Crud
: This covers varieties of snow that all but advanced skiers find impassable. Subtypes are (a) windblown powder with irregularly shaped crust patches and ridges, (b) heavy tracked spring snow re-frozen to leave a deeply rutted surface strewn with loose blocks, (c) a deep layer of heavy snow saturated by rain (although this may go by another term).
;Crust
: A layer of snow on the surface of the snowpack that is stronger than the snow below, which may be powder snow. Depending on their thickness and resulting strength, crusts can be termed "unbreakable", meaning that they will support the weight of a human on skis or "breakable", meaning that they will not. Crusts often result from partial melting of the snow surface by direct sunlight or warm air followed by re-freezing, but can also be created by wind or by surface water.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://glossary.ametsoc.org/wiki/Snow_crust |title=Snow crust - AMS Glossary |website=glossary.ametsoc.org |language=en |access-date=2018-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;
;[[Depth hoar]]
: Faceted snow crystals, usually poorly or completely unbonded (unsintered) to adjacent crystals, creating a weak zone in the snowpack.  Depth hoar forms from metamorphism of the snowpack in response to a large temperature gradient between the warmer ground beneath the snowpack and the surface.  The relatively high porosity (percentage of air space), relatively warm temperature (usually near freezing point), and unbonded weak snow in this layer can allow various organisms to live in it.
;Finger drift
:A narrow snow drift (30 cm to 1 metre in width) crossing a roadway.  Several finger drifts in succession resemble the fingers of a hand.
;[[Firn]]
:Snow which has been lying for at least a year but which has not yet consolidated into [[Glacier#Formation|glaciel ice]]. It is granular.
;Heavy crud
: See 'Crud'.
;[[Ice]]
: Densely packed material formed from snow that doesn't contain air bubbles. Depending on the snow accumulation rate, the air temperature, and the weight of the snow in the upper layers, it can take snow a few hours or a few decades to form into ice.
;Packed powder
:The most common snow cover on ski slopes, consisting of powder snow that has lain on the ground long enough to become compressed by ski traffic, but is still somewhat soft. This is not "true" powder when referencing snow conditions while performing winter recreation activities (i.e. Snowboarding, Skiing, Tobogganing).
[[Image:Packing Snow 8708.jpg|thumb|right|Record 12" fall of packing snow in [[Dallas Texas|Dallas]], [[Texas]], [[United States]] February 2010.]]
;Packing snow
: Snow that is at or near the melting point, so that it can easily be packed into snowballs and thrown or used in the construction of a snowman, or a [[snow fort]].
;[[Penitente (snow formation)|Penitentes]]
: Snow formations of tall upward-pointing blades found at high altitudes.
;Pillow drift
:A snow drift crossing a roadway and usually 3 to 4.5 metres (10–15 feet) in width and 30 cm to 90 cm (1–3 feet) in depth.
;Powder
: Freshly fallen, uncompacted snow. The density and moisture content of powder snow can vary widely; snowfall in coastal regions and areas with higher humidity is usually heavier than a similar depth of snowfall in an arid or continental region. Light, dry (low moisture content, typically 4–7% water content) powder snow is prized by skiers and snowboarders. It is often found in the [[Rocky Mountains]] of North America and in most regions in Japan.
[[File:Long Mynd snowdrift.jpeg|thumb|right|The textures of a snowdrift on the [[Long Mynd]], [[Shropshire]]]]
;[[Slush]]
: Snow which partially melts upon reaching the ground, to the point that it accumulates in puddles of partially frozen water.
;Snirt
:Snow covered with dirt, which occurs most often in spring, in Prairie States like North Dakota, where strong winds pick up black topsoil from uncovered farm fields and blow it into nearby towns where the melt rate is slower. The phenomenon is almost magical; one goes to sleep with white snow outside and awakens to black snow. Also, snow that is dirty, often seen by the side of roads and parking lots near areas that have been plowed.
;[[Snowdrift]]
: Large piles of snow which occur near walls and curbs, as the wind tends to push the snow up toward the vertical surfaces.
;Surface hoar
: Faceted, corn-flake shaped snow crystals that are a type of frost that forms on the surface of the snow pack on cold, clear, calm nights.  Subsequent snowfall can bury layers of surface hoar, incorporating them into the snowpack where they can form a weak layer.  Sometimes referred to as [[hoar frost]].
;[[Spring snow]]
: Late in the winter season, the mid-morning sun melts the top of the frozen snow base creating a soft layer, 1–2 cm deep, that is ideal for long radius carved turns. This is spring snow. By mid-afternoon, the melted layer is likely to have become too deep for enjoyable skiing, i.e. too heavy or too slushy. On some slopes, the melt layer poses an extreme [[avalanche]] risk in the afternoon and ski area management will close such runs by late morning. Ideal spring snow conditions are found when the melt layer does not exceed 2cm and the diurnal cycle of melting and refreezing creates a smooth frozen surface, that does not become overly wet in the sun. An exaggerated melting and refreezing cycle results in 'corn' (see above).
;[[Watermelon snow]]
: A reddish/pink-colored snow, caused by a red-colored [[green algae]] called ''[[Chlamydomonas nivalis]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Surface gas-exchange processes of snow algae |author1=William E. Williams |author2=Holly L. Gorton |author3=Thomas C.

;Wind slab
: A layer of relatively stiff, hard snow formed by deposition of wind blown snow on the leeward side of a ridge or other sheltered area.  Wind slabs can form over weaker, softer freshly fallen powder snow, creating an avalanche hazard on steep slopes.
;[[Yukimarimo]]
:Balls of fine frost formed at low temperatures on the Antarctic plateau during weak wind conditions
;[[Zastrugi]]
:Snow surface features sculpted by wind into ridges and grooves

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12553">'''Wide-area damping control''' (WADC) is a class of automatic control systems used to provide stability augmentation to modern electrical power systems known as [[smart grid]]s.  Actuation for the controller is provided via modulation of capable active or reactive power devices throughout the grid.  Such actuators are most commonly previously-existing power system devices, such as high-voltage DC (HVDC) transmission lines and static VAR compensators (SVCs) which serve primary purposes not directly related to the WADC application. However, damping may be achieved with the utilization of other devices installed with the express purpose of stability augmentation, including energy storage technologies.  Wide-area instability of a large electrical grid unequipped with a WADC is the result of the loss of generator rotor synchronicity and is typically envisioned as a generator (or group of generators) oscillating with an undamped exponential trajectory as the result of insufficient damping torque.

== Rotor Instability Phenomena ==
Large interconnected power systems are susceptible to generator rotor instability, particularly when disparate machine groups are connected to the system through high impedance transmission lines.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/28929603|title=Power system stability and control|last=(Prabha)|first=Kundur, P.|date=1994|publisher=McGraw-Hill|others=Balu, Neal J., Lauby, Mark G.|isbn=9780070359581|location=New York|oclc=28929603}}&lt;/ref&gt; Previously unaccounted for load growth, transmission lines operating closer to rated capacity, connecting two previously electrically isolated subsystems by a single transmission line, and increased renewable resource penetration increase the possibility of lightly-damped oscillations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Roberson|first=D.|last2=O’Brien|first2=J. F.|date=May 2017|title=Loop Shaping of a Wide-Area Damping Controller Using HVDC|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7564476/|journal=IEEE Transactions on Power Systems|volume=32|issue=3|pages=2354–2361|doi=10.1109/tpwrs.2016.2608356|issn=0885-8950}}&lt;/ref&gt; While several causes of resonance exist in electrical grids, inter-area oscillations pose the greatest threat to wide-spread breakup leading to substantial power outages.  Two main sources of inter-area modes are identified:  1.)  two previously electrically isolated systems which are connected by a single (or several parallel) transmission lines or 2.) increased load and generation in an existing system without increased transmission capability.  Both of these conditions continue to be imposed on most large interconnected systems transitioning to the smart grid architecture.

Rotor instability phenomena may be studied by considering two different disturbance types:  small-signal and transient.  ''Small-signal stability'' considers an electric grid subject to "normal" operating conditions, while ''transient stability'' studies the ability of the system to retain stability in the event of a large disturbance (e.g. transmission line fault).  While many different features of the electrical grid impact rotor stability (e.g. transmission line congestion, power system stabilizer (PSS) settings, etc.), the WADC architecture introduces sufficient torque to quell the negative effects of resonant systems.

=== Small-Signal Stability ===
Small-signal rotor stability is the ability of a system to retain synchronicity under ambient perturbation.  The system is linearizable under such an assumption, facilitating the application of linear system theory for stability assessment and WADC design.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/851737563|title=Power System Oscillations|last=Graham.|first=Rogers,|date=2000|publisher=Springer US|isbn=9781461545613|location=Boston, MA|oclc=851737563}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The power transferred between two machines serially connected by impedance &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;  with sending voltage &lt;math&gt;V_s&lt;/math&gt; and receiving voltage  &lt;math&gt;V_r&lt;/math&gt; is given by &lt;math&gt;P={V_{s}V_{r} \over X}\sin\delta&lt;/math&gt;, where  &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt; is the difference in internal rotor angle of the two machines.  Note that to deliver additional power to a load with constant impedance with fixed sending and receiving end voltage, angular separation ''must'' increase.  Maximum power is transferred between the machines when  &lt;math&gt;\delta=90^{o}&lt;/math&gt;; the two generators lose synchronicity for any angle greater than this value.   Nominal operating conditions assume  &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;40^0&lt;/math&gt; to ensure a sufficient margin of stability.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  An ever increasing load with fixed power system equipment (e.g. transmission line impedances constant) force electrical grid to operate closer to unacceptable rotor angle ranges.  This has the effect of diminishing safety margins for the continuous operation of the system, warranting the implementation of a WADC.

=== Transient Stability ===
The so-called ''swing equation'' provides the differential relationship between accelerating power (i.e. the difference between mechanical power at the shaft and electrical power delivered) and the rotor angle.  Considering a turbine spinning at sufficiently high speed that perturbations in rotational velocity may be temporarily ignored, the swing equation (assuming no rotational friction loss) may be expressed thusly: &lt;math&gt;\frac{2H}{\omega_0}\frac{d^2 \delta}{dt^2}=P_m-P_e=P_a&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; is the inertia constant, &lt;math&gt;\omega_0&lt;/math&gt; the nominal system frequency in rad/sec (roughly 377 for a 60&amp;nbsp;Hz system), &lt;math&gt;P_e&lt;/math&gt; the electrical power, and &lt;math&gt;P_m&lt;/math&gt; the mechanical power introduced by the prime mover.  The swing equation establishes a second-order differential relationship that may be solved analytically or using the equal-area criterion (EAC) for a single-machine infinite bus (SMIB) system.  Transient stability considers contingent events of substantial impact on the system that linearization fails to accurately represent the dynamics of interest, including generator trips and transmission line faults.  The result of transient analysis provides an indication of whether or not the generators, when perturbed substantially (i.e. allowed to accelerate/decelerate due to power imbalance), will eventually decelerate/accelerate back to an equilibrium point within reason.  When dealing with large multi-machine systems, analytical solution is intractable and stability assessment must be transitioned to a nonlinear numerical integration platform.

== Methods of Actuation ==
To enhance the rotor stability of a modern electrical grid, various methods to provide damping have been considered for WADCs. High-voltage DC transmission lines, power system stabilizers, wind turbines..,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Singh|first=M.|last2=Allen|first2=A.

Methods employing PSSs frequently modify the g enerator's local PSS control loop, adding an additional voltage reference term to the automatic voltage regulator (AVR) circuit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bourles|first=H.|last2=Peres|first2=S.|last3=Margotin|first3=T.|last4=Houry|first4=M.

Modulation of active power between several coherent generator sets is a common approach to damping inter-area oscillations.  The highest capacity and currently viable actuators are high-voltage DC (HVDC) transmission lines.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Roberson|first=D.|last2=O'Brien|first2=J.

HVDC is limited by their quantity of operational lines and difficulty to install new units. Grid-scale batteries have been considered for active power modulation, in addition to HVDC.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Neely|first=J. C.|last2=Byrne|first2=R. H.|last3=Elliott|first3=R.

Energy storage units are more geographically flexible and easily installed than HVDC, however.  Static VAR compensators (SVCs) and other reactive devices are also used as actuators in wide-area damping control &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hammad|first=A.

== Sensory Equipment ==

Due to the geographically disparate nature of actuators, sensor suites must maintain time synchronism.  While local Caesium [[atomic clock]]s offer the highest accuracy time fidelity, GPS technology allows continued synchronicity of measured control feedback signals as they are sent to the aggregated WADC processing center.  Without remote sensing capability, the WADC control scheme is severely limited in damping capability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cresap|first=R. L.|last2=Mittelstadt|first2=W.

These modern sensors provide sufficiently high reporting rate and minimal measurement error required for high-performance control systems.  However, latency and the potential for GPS spoofing provide challenges for the implementation of a WADC with PMUs &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Roberson|first=D.|last2=O’Brien|first2=J.
